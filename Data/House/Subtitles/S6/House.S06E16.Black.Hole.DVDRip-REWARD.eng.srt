1
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,930
It's estimated
the observable universe

2
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:41,872
is 93 billion
light years across.

3
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,842
It's probably
more accurate to...

4
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,277
I'm gonna be
so far away.

5
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,673
I don't care. I don't wanna break up.

6
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,978
I'll come
on the weekends.

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,282
Stanford's on the other
side of the country.

8
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,413
My dad has like 10 million
frequent flier miles.

9
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,286
He won't care.

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,027
We all right
over there?

11
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,899
Yes, Mr. Damon, I just had
something caught in my throat.

12
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,030
Abby, you know
you're not supposed

13
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:15,699
to have any food
or drinks in here.

14
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:17,743
It's just water.
I have a cough,

15
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,938
I didn't want to
disturb anyone.

16
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,811
We can only observe
4% of the universe.

17
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,440
The rest of it
is unaccounted for.

18
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,314
I never knew you were such a good liar.

19
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,786
Well, a little more vodka and you
might find out some more things

20
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,220
you didn't know
about me.

21
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,621
Really?

22
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,919
Nicholas.

23
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,016
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:38,224
What conclusions can we draw from
the incredible number of stars?

25
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:40,892
That the movie's either gonna
be really good or really bad.

26
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:47,268
I was thinking more about the
implications for extraterrestrial life.

27
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:51,473
Well, I guess if there's
an infinite number of stars,

28
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,068
odds are there's
at least one galaxy

29
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,511
with life other
than our own.

30
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:55,878
Or?

31
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,349
Or not?

32
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:02,286
Or our solar system
is somehow unique.

33
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:05,085
The question then becomes, in what way?

34
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:09,117
The question then becomes, could you
possibly teach us anything more useless?

35
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,730
What're you
looking at?

36
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,594
Abby?

37
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:20,835
Oh, my God. Something's
wrong! She's not breathing!

38
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,104
Call 911!

39
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:17,353
Would you mind at least putting
a napkin under your jelly toast?

40
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,264
Get a table and I
won't eat on the couch.

41
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,890
Yes, you will.

42
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,601
But I won't
have a good excuse.

43
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,866
Why don't you
go get a table?

44
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,703
It's not my condo.

45
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,270
You have
my permission.

46
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,334
Pick out
whatever you want.

47
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,243
Then it would be a
reflection of me, not you.

48
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,440
That wouldn't
be right.

49
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,641
No, it would be a reflection of the fact

50
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,514
that the guy who's
been mooching off of me

51
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,848
for as long
as I can remember

52
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,013
isn't a complete
ingrate.

53
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,557
You've never
furnished a home.

54
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,028
I have furnished
a bunch of homes.

55
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:52,826
No, you've married
a bunch of women

56
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,093
who've furnished
a bunch of homes.

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,531
You want to eat off
something, fine,

58
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,162
move your piano in here
and eat off that.

59
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,561
You're afraid.

60
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,130
Of a dining table?

61
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,335
You know, they don't
actually come to life

62
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,878
when you put a knob
off your bedpost on them.

63
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,914
You are what
you sit in.

64
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,714
Your friends, your job, your
furnishings, it all defines you.

65
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,945
You don't really
believe that.

66
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,217
You just don't want
to do the shopping.

67
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,951
Buy some furniture

68
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,060
or admit that
you're empty inside.

69
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:26,858
Hmm.

70
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,532
X
- rays confirm the fluid that almost suffocated her to death

71
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,904
was from pulmonary edema.

72
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,170
Means the problem is either
in her heart or lungs.

73
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,439
Tox screen's clean for
everything except the alcohol,

74
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,504
and her BAC
was barely. 05.

75
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,073
Means she only had
one or two drinks, tops.

76
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,449
And there's no sign
of trauma.

77
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,215
How did you know?

78
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,756
Because if there was,

79
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,518
Cuddy wouldn't have
needed me to take the case.

80
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:54,583
How'd you know Cuddy... Foreman's
the only one with the balls

81
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,288
to take a case without checking with me

82
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:59,991
and he's still working on
breakfast, which means that

83
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,794
the 18, no, 17-year-old
honor student...

84
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:09,399
Cuddy has a soft spot
for smart girls,

85
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,874
and they don't
start drinking

86
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,309
until second semester
senior year.

87
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,075
So, either you think that smart
women look out for each other,

88
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,207
which means
you're an idiot,

89
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,979
or you think Cuddy's
not smart, which means...

90
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,748
Well, I guess it's
the same both ways.

91
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,810
Then how did you...

92
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:23,981
Picture fell out
of the file.

93
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,581
She looks smart.

94
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,852
Where's Taub?

95
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:28,120
You don't
already know?

96
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,321
Yeah, he's at home
in a fight with his wife.

97
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm just curious what
he wanted me to know.

98
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,694
His car has a flat tire.
He's waiting for a tow truck.

99
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,327
What about rising blood
pressure from binge drinking?

100
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:39,769
It could set off a hypertensive
crisis, cause heart failure.

101
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,466
Two drinks is
hardly a binge.

102
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,441
Certainly not if
you're an Aussie,

103
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,999
but when
an American school girl

104
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,511
has two drinks
before 10:00 a. m.,

105
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:49,173
it's a pretty sure bet that
the plan is to have a lot more.

106
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,943
It probably wasn't the
first time she had that plan.

107
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,917
We'll get
a C-13 pyruvate MRI

108
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:55,044
to check for cardiac
lactic-acid levels.

109
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,588
Someone call Taub.

110
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,283
Tell him to cut the ball
and chain on his own time.

111
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,717
We're arguing
about couples yoga.

112
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:04,024
No. We're arguing
over the fact

113
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,031
that we don't ever do
anything together anymore.

114
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:07,930
We don't ever do
anything together?

115
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,127
Chris, I love you, but I swear,
if you start talking to me

116
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,431
like I'm on the witness stand
again, I'm gonna break your neck.

117
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,301
Honey, we do stuff
together all the time.

118
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,342
Really? Like what?

119
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:20,038
And besides sleeping, watching
TV, going out to dinner,

120
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,877
what do we do together,
just the two of us?

121
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,109
We...

122
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,920
You don't like
going out to dinner?

123
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,485
All right,
I'll do the yoga.

124
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,649
Forget it.

125
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,750
Now you don't
want me to do it?

126
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,761
Just go to work.
No.

127
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,497
I'm not leaving
until we work this out.

128
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,057
I'm fine.
Please, just go.

129
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,523
Where's Abby Nash?

130
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,389
I'm Nick, her boyfriend.
This is my dad.

131
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,590
Hi.

132
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,723
You can wait in...

133
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,097
Where is she?

134
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,658
Is she okay?

135
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,429
She's having
some tests run.

136
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,336
Is she okay?

137
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:27,346
We think her drinking
may have damaged her heart.

138
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:28,812
Her heart?

139
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:32,413
No. She doesn't drink.
Not that much.

140
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,679
Just when
she's at school?

141
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,277
Nick, what's he
talking about?

142
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:38,517
It was a field trip. One
of the kids had a fake ID.

143
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,149
But, Dad, you know Abby. Tell him.

144
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,490
I know what she's like when the
two of you are around me, but...

145
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,690
If you're right, the tests
will come back negative.

146
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,926
Can you give her
a message?

147
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,666
I brought her homework.
And I love her.

148
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,577
Sorry I'm late.

149
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,781
Nick loves you.

150
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,626
House doesn't believe
you got a flat tire.

151
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:17,856
What does he
think I was doing?

152
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,022
Fighting with the wife.

153
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,259
Why would I lie
about that?

154
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,461
She wants me
to do yoga.

155
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,941
We need thinner cuts.

156
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,909
When you and Cameron
had disagreements...

157
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,747
I'm probably not the best guy
to go to for marital advice.

158
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,183
Sorry.

159
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:43,149
It's just... What's
that in the mitral valve?

160
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,780
All right,
I get the message.

161
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,087
No. No, I'm serious.

162
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,684
What is that?

163
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,766
Could be a fungus.

164
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,811
ER drew blood cultures.
All negative.

165
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,243
No parasites,
no fungus.

166
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,372
Could be fastidious
enteric bacteria.

167
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,611
You think she's been
eating your wife's cooking?

168
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,553
Hey, I'm on
your side, man.

169
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,885
I am not fighting with my
wife. I had a flat tire.

170
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:20,084
It's in my trunk. You can
go look at it if you want.

171
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,151
Don't need to. Face
tells me you're bluffing.

172
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,729
Not yours, Chase's.

173
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,096
If she was infected through
the intestinal tract,

174
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,464
she'd have
intestinal symptoms.

175
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,935
There are other ways to get enteric
bacteria into the bloodstream.

176
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,472
She's not an intravenous
drug user, she has no tattoos,

177
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,632
and she doesn't
have any scars

178
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,732
that would indicate
she's a cutter.

179
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,505
Transesophageal echo could give us a
better idea of what we're looking at.

180
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,103
If that valve is
about to dehisce,

181
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,114
echo could trigger
a heart attack.

182
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:44,979
So come up with
a better idea,

183
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,076
or have a crash
cart ready.

184
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,752
Why are you
lying to House?

185
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,323
Chase told me.
What's the big deal?

186
00:09:55,394 --> 00:09:58,420
Maybe we can talk about
this another time. Or never.

187
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,658
I really don't think
she's gonna tell anyone.

188
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,530
If I admit
we were fighting,

189
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,092
he's gonna want
to know what about.

190
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,695
So tell him, or tell him
it's none of his business.

191
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,137
This is easier.
Really?

192
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:10,641
Because it seems
much harder.

193
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:12,442
What do I know?
I'm not a guy.

194
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,479
Yes, if only
I could be as open

195
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,777
about my emotional
life as you are.

196
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,318
It's not about the yoga.

197
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,047
Really? I thought it was, since we
spent an hour talking about yoga,

198
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,611
but what do I know?
I'm not a girl.

199
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,850
My guess is she thinks you
don't want to spend time with her

200
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,052
because you're spending it
with someone else.

201
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,857
If she thinks I'm
cheating, she would ask.

202
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,057
Because you'd
tell the truth?

203
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,463
I'm not seeing
anyone else.

204
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,125
Doesn't matter.
You have a history.

205
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,533
And that's not her fault.

206
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:40,663
So what am I supposed to do?
I can't prove a negative.

207
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,799
That is a problem.

208
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,668
There's the heart.

209
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,980
Valves look fine. No vegetations.
No myxomatous changes.

210
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,784
Can you give her
a little more sedative?

211
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,147
She's dissecting.
She's rupturing.

212
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,384
Get the scope out.

213
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,425
This doesn't make sense.
Her BP's normal,

214
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,623
and her heart rate
was controlled.

215
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:06,858
We'll figure it out later.

216
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:09,423
We've only got about 30
seconds to get her open.

217
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,204
No leakage from
the cannulation site.

218
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,364
Nice.

219
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,102
Let's see if
she'll start up.

220
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,040
Cardiac paddles.

221
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,903
Charging.

222
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:23,237
And go.

223
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:24,908
Come on.

224
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,849
Again.
Go.

225
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,185
Pushing five cc's
adrenaline.

226
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:35,323
Zap her again.
No.

227
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,160
It's not working. Clear.

228
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,868
Clear.

229
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,241
Normal sinus rhythm.

230
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,111
Thank God.

231
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,386
<i>TEE and intra-operative visualization</i>

232
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,657
<i>showed no vegetations
on the valves,</i>

233
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,392
no structural
abnormalities.

234
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,058
The dissection means
we were wrong

235
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,398
about alcohol causing
a hypertensive crisis.

236
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,370
And by "we" you mean "you. " Yeah.

237
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,406
You were the one who didn't
have any better ideas.

238
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,534
It's not my fault. I was
busy trying to judge Taub.

239
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,805
Since we already
ruled out trauma,

240
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,346
the dissection's
probably a genetic defect.

241
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,439
We're running the tests.
She's not marfanoid.

242
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,143
What about an allergy?

243
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:35,381
A severe enough one could set
off a systemic immune reaction,

244
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:38,548
cause fluid in the lungs and
inflammation that could weaken the aorta.

245
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,559
If it was an allergy, she'd be getting
better in the hospital, not worse.

246
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,618
Unless it was
inside her.

247
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,694
Meaning?

248
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:50,033
You want my sperm?

249
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,970
We think a severe allergic reaction
could be causing a systemic breakdown.

250
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,563
To my son's sperm?

251
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,974
Actually, his semen is
more likely the problem,

252
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,308
which I realize is not
what you were reacting to.

253
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,907
When's the last time the two
of you had unprotected sex?

254
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,747
Never.
I use a condom.

255
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,812
You always use a condom?
For everything?

256
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,019
Well,
for most everything.

257
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,220
When?

258
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,661
The night before
she collapsed.

259
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,630
I'm placing a drop of Nick's
semen protein onto the skin.

260
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,192
Then I'll abrade it
with a needle,

261
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,933
check for a rash
in an hour or so.

262
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:34,076
Mom, come on, we've been
dating for three years.

263
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:38,082
I'm not mad, sweetheart.
I'm just confused.

264
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,517
A systemic reaction can be
triggered by the protein in semen.

265
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:45,023
In most cases, the
reaction is fairly minor,

266
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,217
but in rare cases,
repeat exposure

267
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:49,853
can trigger a hypersensitivity response.

268
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,056
"Repeat exposure"?

269
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,760
I know, I know,
three years.

270
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,526
Is this supposed to hurt?

271
00:13:58,404 --> 00:13:59,769
A reaction should
take longer than...

272
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,170
No, it's not that. Ow.

273
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,264
Abby, what's wrong?

274
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,638
My stomach.

275
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,809
Blood in the urine.

276
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,474
Help me!

277
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,110
No allergic reaction.

278
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,587
On the other hand, now
her kidneys are failing.

279
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,283
Could be some
kind of neuropathy.

280
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,485
Syphilitic
lightning pains?

281
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,323
It's not syphilis.

282
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:26,489
VDRL and enzyme
immunoassays were negative.

283
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,589
What about
a blood clot?

284
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,826
While she's on
anticoagulants

285
00:14:28,901 --> 00:14:30,163
for the aortic surgery?

286
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,430
Interstitial nephritis?

287
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,267
Wouldn't cause the edema or dissection.

288
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,171
But cancer could.

289
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,669
Would you care to be a
little bit more specific?

290
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,711
If I could,
I would've.

291
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,775
We could do
a full body scan.

292
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,914
We hate
full body scans.

293
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,954
And by "we"
you mean "you. "

294
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,750
We also hate when
a patient dies

295
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:53,087
before we figure out
what's wrong with them.

296
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:57,495
Do the scan.

297
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,197
How can you convince someone
you're not cheating on them?

298
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,930
Don't cheat. After a
while, they'll catch on.

299
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:06,631
What if I don't want
to wait that long?

300
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:09,640
Take them with you wherever
you go for 24 hours a day.

301
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:12,905
So your wife's a little
insecure. Is that so bad?

302
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,570
At least you know
she still cares.

303
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:19,016
I know she cares. What I
want is for her to be happy.

304
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,685
What? You don't think I
want my wife to be happy?

305
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,488
Sure. As long as
it makes you happy.

306
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,189
What do you think?

307
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,619
I think you work quickly.

308
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:09,725
Piece of cake. You give them
money, they give you furniture.

309
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,360
Not bad, huh?

310
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:15,234
Nope, it's not
bad at all.

311
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,343
It's taking
a really long time.

312
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,888
<i>Just hang in there, and try not
to talk unless you really have to.</i>

313
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,083
<i>It can affect
the images.</i>

314
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,421
What was that? Hello,
are you still there?

315
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,624
I think there's something
wrong with the machine.

316
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,965
<i>It's not the machine.
It's an earthquake.</i>

317
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,095
<i>Hold on,
we'll get you out.</i>

318
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,105
Get me out now.

319
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:29,879
Oh, my God!
I can't hold on!

320
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,822
It's a black hole.

321
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,157
She's hallucinating.

322
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,060
I certainly hope so.

323
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:55,431
Hallucination
means brain problem.

324
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,203
Brain problems don't
split your aorta.

325
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,041
A vascular problem
could explain both.

326
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:03,013
Inflammation in
the blood vessel walls

327
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,913
leads to dissection
in the aorta

328
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,848
and could cause an aneurysm in the brain

329
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,546
that could cause
the visions.

330
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,053
It's a bit convoluted,

331
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,352
but brain and heart function
are susceptible, too.

332
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,984
If there was any sign of the
inflammation of the aorta,

333
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,153
that would make sense.

334
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,636
House!
That's not funny.

335
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:00,069
I've got enough
problems already!

336
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,437
Trust me,
this is gonna help.

337
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,738
An aneurysm explains
the hallucinations,

338
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,246
and it's the one thing we haven't
excluded from the differential.

339
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,611
Your texting does not
prove you're faithful.

340
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,378
It just proves you know she
thinks you're unfaithful.

341
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:17,183
You can't force trust.
What did she hallucinate?

342
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,151
The content of the
hallucination isn't relevant.

343
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,214
Not usually.

344
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,282
Not ever.

345
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,825
We know nothing,
brain knows all.

346
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,422
You get an ulcer,
you don't know it,

347
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,899
but the brain increases
mucin secretions.

348
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,094
It knows what
the problem is,

349
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,501
it knows where
the problem is.

350
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,165
It's a big logical jump
from a body's immune response

351
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,640
to the brain giving
subconscious diagnostic clues.

352
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,041
What about dreaming about
waterfalls, running streams

353
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,204
if you need to go
to the bathroom?

354
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,113
Sure. That's the same as the brain
shouting, "You have pancreatic cancer. "

355
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,243
Her subconscious is trying
to tell her something.

356
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,310
We need to eavesdrop.

357
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:52,255
She was screaming she was
being sucked into a black hole.

358
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:54,519
So we should look for
a tumor in her anus.

359
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,823
We need the whole story.

360
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,261
A cognitive pattern
recognition program

361
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,561
might tell us what's
going on in her head.

362
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,569
Or we could act
on something

363
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:07,764
based in science,
not science fiction.

364
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,831
Get an MRA with contrast to
see if she has an aneurysm.

365
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,707
Unless you think Cuddy's
gonna go for the mind reading.

366
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:15,144
Fine. Do the MRA.

367
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,306
When it comes
back negative,

368
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:20,875
we can move on to the
crazy, but possible, ideas.

369
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:02,291
What did you do
with the furniture?

370
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,851
I returned it.

371
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,520
You told me to buy it.

372
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,328
But you didn't buy it.
You rented it.

373
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:14,101
You made one phone call
to Economy Furniture Supply.

374
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,800
"We get it done,
so you don't have to. "

375
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,343
So what?
We had a table, chairs...

376
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,436
But no clue what
any of it meant.

377
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,079
Fine. I'll hire
a decorator.

378
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,777
Perfect. Another woman
to tell you who you are.

379
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,479
I'll hire
a male decorator.

380
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:32,011
Step inside one furniture store
and find one thing you like.

381
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,092
I like not doing this.

382
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,120
One.

383
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,499
Abby.

384
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,739
Hi.

385
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,371
Where's my mom?

386
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:57,775
She went down to get some breakfast.

387
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,180
How are you
feeling?

388
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:05,081
Well, besides the fact that I can
barely breathe and I ache all over,

389
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,452
not good.

390
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,922
Anything I can do?

391
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,758
Just don't go.

392
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,556
I'm not going anywhere.

393
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:33,144
Been a while since we've gone
more than a day without doing that.

394
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,809
I'm not going anywhere.

395
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,449
What'd you say?

396
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:42,083
I've been
thinking...

397
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,924
Been a long time since we went
more than a day without doing that.

398
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:58,471
We have a secret.

399
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:03,544
Now, you don't need
to answer right now,

400
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,652
but, Abby,
I want to marry you.

401
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,820
Tell him the secret.
It's okay.

402
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,326
Something's wrong.

403
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,965
What? Abby, what are you feeling?

404
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,024
I don't know.

405
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,434
Your secret
is killing you.

406
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,872
I see... Maybe it's
all the medication.

407
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,835
I was just...

408
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,409
Abby, can you hear me?

409
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,677
You deserve to die.

410
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,921
I need four milligrams
lorazepam.

411
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,664
She seized
for over a minute.

412
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,069
Inner-ictal EEG showed
no synchronous discharges.

413
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:03,133
And the MRA?

414
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,735
No aneurysms or arterial or
venous malformations in the brain.

415
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,369
As predicted.

416
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,874
What did we say
we'd move on to?

417
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:12,847
Out of body experiences
can be induced

418
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:15,011
by sensory overload in the
temporoparietal junction.

419
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,554
Temporoparietal junction
was clean on MRI,

420
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,214
MRA, and whole body scan.

421
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,318
Which just leaves us
with the question of

422
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,522
what happened during the
out of body experience?

423
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:29,158
If I say her blood pressure shot
up over 200 and she bit her tongue,

424
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,997
would that be
a satisfactory answer?

425
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,867
Sure. If you then went on
to answer the following,

426
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,669
did she float above her
body? Did she see Jesus?

427
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:38,208
Did she bathe
in the Ganges?

428
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:41,609
No, no and no. Can we get
back to the medical science?

429
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,874
No.

430
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,609
She claims she emerged
from her body

431
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,151
as a younger version of
herself and started talking.

432
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,846
She couldn't remember
what was discussed.

433
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,854
But I'm sure
it wasn't a differential.

434
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,981
House, cognitive
pattern recognition

435
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,686
is 50 years from being
a useful diagnostic tool.

436
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,627
Even if we can get the equipment, it
takes hours for the initial mapping.

437
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,756
If she has another seizure,
she could stroke out.

438
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,960
Coincidentally, she could also
have a stroke if we do nothing.

439
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:06,128
I'm not telling a mother
who's scared out of her mind

440
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,967
that our best shot
is a magic trick.

441
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,337
It's not magical,
it's experimental.

442
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,275
Just like washing your
hands after pooping once was.

443
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,313
And technically,
it's not our best shot.

444
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,280
I'm pretty sure
it's our only shot.

445
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,953
Perfect. So, Foreman,
go get her consent.

446
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,319
The rest of you, go
down to the cog-sci lab.

447
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,358
The equipment
should already be there.

448
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,064
I'll catch up.

449
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:46,142
Thanks for the invite.

450
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,042
I am not sure I'm up
for the hospital food.

451
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:51,048
Good, 'cause I wasn't
planning on lunch.

452
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,149
While you watch
video clips,

453
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:57,619
a computer maps how your
brain processes the images.

454
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,349
How long
will it take?

455
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:02,154
Six hours. But that's
really just the prep.

456
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,025
Once the computer maps how
she processes the information,

457
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,996
we'll put her under
twilight sedation,

458
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,125
use the same equipment to
monitor her unconscious thoughts.

459
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,362
Hopefully, it'll spit
out a very basic video

460
00:26:12,437 --> 00:26:14,200
of whatever's
going on in her head.

461
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,069
And what will
that tell you?

462
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,802
Hopefully,
it'll give us a clue

463
00:26:17,876 --> 00:26:20,037
as to where your brain
thinks the problem is.

464
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,738
A lot of "hopefullys. "

465
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,542
Could it hurt her?

466
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:26,409
We're at a diagnostic dead end.

467
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,076
We've got to
try something.

468
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,988
This is much better
than lunch.

469
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,429
I agree.

470
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,165
What made you
think of this?

471
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,602
I missed you.

472
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:52,772
No, I mean this. The
car in the parking lot.

473
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,939
I just don't like
feeling like

474
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,947
maybe this isn't the first
time you've done this.

475
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:00,883
It's the first. I love you.
You know that, right?

476
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,078
Yes.

477
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,349
I want you to be
able to trust me.

478
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,320
And I want to, but...

479
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:20,801
Inspiration Point doesn't
open till after dark.

480
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,308
Got a real cool magic
show about to start.

481
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:29,012
Also, I'm gonna need
to check your spare.

482
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:57,766
<i>Abby, can you think
of something specific?</i>

483
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,934
Like what?

484
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,501
Doesn't matter. Just
make it a single image.

485
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,158
What are you thinking?

486
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,995
About Nick
playing baseball.

487
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:24,626
Holy crap.

488
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,761
That's amazing.

489
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:26,826
Yeah.

490
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:29,536
Now all we have to do
is read her subconscious

491
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:33,509
and hope that it's completely
rational and went to med school.

492
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,879
Does anything
get you excited?

493
00:28:46,925 --> 00:28:48,290
Can I help you
with something?

494
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,417
Yes.

495
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,226
I was wondering if
you could tell me

496
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:54,492
a little bit about
this dining table.

497
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:57,262
It's made of wood
and you eat off it.

498
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:59,360
So you're paid
by commission?

499
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:00,461
It's furniture.

500
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:03,701
Find something you like,
let me know, I'll ring it up.

501
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:06,101
Thank you so much.

502
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,270
Okay, that's...
That's not...

503
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:47,176
That is a remarkable collection,
if I can show it to you.

504
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,776
I'm Gabriella.

505
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:53,015
I'm really just looking for
a nice dining room table.

506
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,525
I see. You're daring.

507
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,187
Yes, I do that sometimes.

508
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:01,994
But right now,
why am I daring?

509
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,330
You're not
constrained by rules.

510
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:07,303
What else attracts you
in the patio section?

511
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:10,739
Wait. This is a patio
table? For outside?

512
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,691
Well, it's taken us
just over an hour

513
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,925
to prove that she has a
very boring subconscious.

514
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,766
Anyone ever tell you you
can be a real buzzkill?

515
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,166
Yes.

516
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:43,806
Stars. Maybe
that's a stripe.

517
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,576
It's the sky.

518
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:50,373
She's thinking about the
moon and the stars in the sky.

519
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,712
She's going to Stanford
to study physics.

520
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,150
It's not a big revelation
that she'd think about the sky.

521
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,156
Or a star could be a
white blood cell. Leukemia?

522
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,429
Who's that?

523
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,063
Her dad? He died
when she was eight.

524
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,033
What did Daddy die of?

525
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,563
Private plane crash.
No connection.

526
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:18,735
Stars, moon, sky, white
blood cells, heart valves,

527
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,402
black holes, or anus,

528
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:23,140
or a million other circular
passageways into the body,

529
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,180
and her dad.

530
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,411
What do you think
it means?

531
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,654
She likes school and
she has daddy issues.

532
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:33,517
Neither of which
helps us.

533
00:31:37,862 --> 00:31:40,524
So now what do we do?
Start over?

534
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,031
We obviously
missed something.

535
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,824
What about the liver?

536
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,665
What about her left toe?

537
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,897
Oh, sorry,

538
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,836
I thought we were randomly
picking out body parts

539
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,738
that had nothing to
do with her symptoms.

540
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,935
Liver's responsible
for proteins,

541
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,571
immunological effects,
production of red blood cells.

542
00:31:55,647 --> 00:31:58,878
Might be able to explains the
lungs, the hallucinations...

543
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,145
Not the aortic
dissection.

544
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,312
Her kidneys
are also failing.

545
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,915
Polycystic disease could
explain the dissection.

546
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:08,856
So, that's one
imperfect theory

547
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,361
plus a rare complication
of a second theory,

548
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,091
which gives us a complete explanation.

549
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,258
Don't polish
the notion, Foreman.

550
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,067
Pineal gland
is calcified.

551
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:24,108
It's supposed to be calcified.
Happens after puberty.

552
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,666
What if it's
obscuring a tumor?

553
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,706
It's the only place we
couldn't look inside.

554
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,305
Get a better look
at her pineal gland

555
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,180
with three Tesla
fast-spin echo MRI.

556
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,791
You're pacing my office
'cause you're buying furniture?

557
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,419
No. I'm pacing
your office

558
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:48,431
because I'm physically
incapable of buying furniture.

559
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,467
For Amber's old place?

560
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,570
Yeah. It needs
some new...

561
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,265
I know you bought
the place I wanted.

562
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,241
You're a jerk, let's
move on. Hire a decorator.

563
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,937
I'm supposed to find me.

564
00:33:01,012 --> 00:33:03,105
Backpack through Europe.

565
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,880
I know it's hard
to believe,

566
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,075
but you know
what says even more

567
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,311
about who you are
than your furniture?

568
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:10,047
The fact that
you are letting House

569
00:33:10,121 --> 00:33:12,487
tell you how
to buy furniture.

570
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,718
Call Beatrice.

571
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:30,366
MRI revealed no remarkable
features on her pineal gland,

572
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:31,999
but there were
slightly elevated levels

573
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:34,874
of lactate dehydrogenase isoenzymes.

574
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,339
Which we would
expect to see

575
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,473
if there was an allergic
reaction happening.

576
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:40,847
There's definitely
no allergy.

577
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,648
Parasite? There's this
Middle Eastern parasite...

578
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,418
How exactly do you
want to be shot down?

579
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,254
On the basis of the fact
that she's never

580
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,261
been within 6,000 miles
of the Middle East.

581
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,193
Or on the basis of the fact
that all our scans

582
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:56,233
and urine samples
came back clean.

583
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:01,100
And yet she's still failing.
System after system.

584
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:08,069
So, either we find
the answer at autopsy or...

585
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:13,808
What?

586
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:19,078
I got nothing.

587
00:34:56,928 --> 00:35:01,194
I was gonna head out. If there's
any change, I assume you'll page me.

588
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,193
Are you having
an affair?

589
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,498
Does it bother you that your
wife doesn't have the guts

590
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,974
to actually ask
that question and I do?

591
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:13,738
On both ends, yes.

592
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,336
Difference is, I'm not
afraid of the answer.

593
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,279
And I might
believe you.

594
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,475
I'm not having an affair.

595
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,710
But you want to.

596
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,343
No, I don't.

597
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,149
I'm through
living like that.

598
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,780
Why?

599
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:26,949
What, you finally
got to the point

600
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,685
where half your
age plus seven

601
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,784
just isn't
young enough?

602
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,386
Talk to you later, House.

603
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:36,263
Or is it because you now really
are old enough to be their...

604
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,370
The dad.

605
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,901
Does he travel for work?

606
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,212
What do you mean, does he?
He died almost 10 years ago.

607
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,378
Not hers.
Her boyfriend's.

608
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,777
He's the one
in her visions.

609
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:04,253
I'm your son's
girlfriend's doctor.

610
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,419
Oh!

611
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:09,624
It's a mouthful, but probably
not as tricky as your title.

612
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,995
Okay. Is Abby
gonna be all right?

613
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,570
Do you travel a lot?

614
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,629
Yeah, I have a food
import business. Why?

615
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,139
Where do you go?

616
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:20,234
All over. France, Italy,
the Mediterranean? Why?

617
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,674
I think you exposed her
to a parasite.

618
00:36:24,081 --> 00:36:25,139
Oh!

619
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:27,746
I thought the scans
didn't show any.

620
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,718
Because she doesn't
have any.

621
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:31,618
But you just said...
It's cool.

622
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:36,058
My theory is that her body was
able to kill off the parasite,

623
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,619
but what it couldn't do
was get rid of the shell,

624
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,995
which doesn't
show up on the scans.

625
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:45,001
That little piece of
microscopic garbage

626
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:49,335
set off an allergic reaction
called Cerebellar Schistosomiasis

627
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:54,401
delayed Hypersensitivity
Allergy or "CSDHA."

628
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,076
Risky, unpleasant treatment,
but completely curable.

629
00:36:58,149 --> 00:36:59,480
Well, that's fantastic.

630
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:02,883
You'd think so, wouldn't
you? Only thing is,

631
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:06,252
did you ever have sex
with your son's girlfriend?

632
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:09,952
Where the hell
do you get off...

633
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,654
Shut up.

634
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,564
See, I can't treat this
unless I can confirm it.

635
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,998
The only way she could
have been exposed

636
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,696
to this parasite
is sexually,

637
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,499
which means she's
gonna die very soon

638
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,096
unless you admit
that you slept with her.

639
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,771
Dad. What's going on?

640
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,280
Gee, this is bad,

641
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,680
because you now have
to choose between

642
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,049
her living and the
truth becoming public,

643
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,022
and frankly, given what the
truth is, it's a tough call.

644
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,458
You'd broken up.
She was crying...

645
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:50,232
Your girlfriend is not
allergic to your semen.

646
00:37:50,301 --> 00:37:52,326
She's allergic to
the Egyptian parasites

647
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,963
swimming around
in your dad's semen.

648
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,434
You slept with Abby?

649
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:02,808
I was drunk. We both...

650
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,974
No need to explain.
Technically, she was legal.

651
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,644
Wait, wait! Wait!

652
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:16,960
Hey, all things considered,
it's actually great news.

653
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,100
So, what do
you think?

654
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,977
You wussed out
and used a decorator.

655
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:40,211
Why can't that be me?
A wuss who loves decorators.

656
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,308
Because it's not.

657
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:42,818
Okay, it's not.

658
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,822
But don't return it.
I can't keep doing this.

659
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,122
You have to. You can't keep
letting other people define you.

660
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,196
Not another elephant.

661
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,810
The decorator
didn't pick this.

662
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:16,580
You're gonna have
to buy your own cape.

663
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,545
I like what this says
about you, Wilson.

664
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,183
Wait, I don't remember him
at the wedding, do you?

665
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,252
I don't remember most of the
people who were at our wedding.

666
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,501
Which is why

667
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,603
I thought I'd ask the love
of my life to marry me.

668
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,344
We're already married.

669
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,439
I want to be
better at it.

670
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,546
Well, that's beautiful.

671
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,981
What did you tell him?

672
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,383
That it doesn't mean
she doesn't love him.

673
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,317
And he bought it?

674
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,924
It's true.

675
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,995
Your wife say yes?

676
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:17,591
How did you know...

677
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,499
Monkey see,
monkey do.

678
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:23,372
At least he has the
"young and stupid" excuse.

679
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,964
She said yes.

680
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:29,502
Good for you.

681
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,314
Thank you.
