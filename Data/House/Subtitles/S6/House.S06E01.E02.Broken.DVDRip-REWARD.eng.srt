1
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:32,884
Help!

2
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:36,957
Help me!

3
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,189
Dry heaves are
gone, so am I.

4
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,888
I'll check with the doctor.

5
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:46,398
No, no, no. I'm here voluntarily.
Just got to check with me.

6
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:49,697
I'm sorry. Dr. Nolan left
specific instructions.

7
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,736
She's not sick, she's
scared. So tell her to tell...

8
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:56,900
Wow.

9
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:00,007
And he's black.

10
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,442
Thought you'd be a little more
sensitive on the slavery issue.

11
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,285
You can't keep me.

12
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,387
Dr. House,
you look a lot better.

13
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:19,590
I am a lot better.

14
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,260
No painkillers,
no hallucinations.

15
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,962
Leg hurts,
but it's manageable.

16
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,902
Great job.
Gonna miss you.

17
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,963
Want to start missing you
as soon as possible.

18
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,875
Well, legally, you're free to go
whenever you want, but I suggest you stay.

19
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,412
I'll take it
under advisement.

20
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,777
If you thought the hallucinations
were from your Vicodin problem,

21
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,941
why didn't you just check
yourself into a rehab facility?

22
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,577
I was deluded into
thinking I might be crazy.

23
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,780
But you have been
abusing Vicodin for years.

24
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,187
Never had delusions,
never had trouble sleeping,

25
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:48,750
never had any problems, other than
narcissism and anti-social behavior,

26
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:52,264
until two colleagues
died, your father died.

27
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,128
Your issues run
deeper than Vicodin.

28
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,903
That's not gonna
cheer me up, is it?

29
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,202
You need to be transferred
to our long-term ward,

30
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,071
started on medication,
talk therapy...

31
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:04,404
Yeah. I get it.

32
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,847
Just one thing I'm getting hung
up on. I can leave whenever I want.

33
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,008
How about I start with that?

34
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,516
You can't go back
to practicing medicine.

35
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,484
I don't want
to practice medicine.

36
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,027
I've decided I want 
to be an astronaut.

37
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,996
Well, if you want your
state astronaut's license,

38
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,555
you're gonna need
my recommendation.

39
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,764
Is that a popular
new treatment, blackmail?

40
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,463
You need to get better.

41
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,713
Welcome to Ward Six.

42
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:55,726
So, brass tacks.

43
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,423
What do I have to do and
how long do I have to be here?

44
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,592
Depends on you.
Process is pretty basic.

45
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,831
If you follow the schedule,
agree to take meds,

46
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,873
participate in group and individual
therapy, we can work on goals...

47
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,066
I set a goal.

48
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,234
Excellent.
What is it?

49
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,212
My goal is to get your boss to write
the letter that I want him to write.

50
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,474
Now let's talk process.

51
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:18,210
I can smile through
gritted teeth and play nice,

52
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:20,616
but there are serious risks of
violence involved in that choice.

53
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,315
So I'm going with turning
this ward upside down,

54
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,449
making you and your boss'
job and life so unmanageable

55
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,586
that he'll write whatever he
has to write to get rid of me.

56
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,890
He's all set.

57
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:32,021
Thanks.

58
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,307
Yo, I don't need
an escort. Get off me.

59
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,612
Who are you?
You believe these guys?

60
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,619
Lecturing me on manic depression,
like I couldn't write a book or two.

61
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,178
I stopped taking my meds because
I want to stop taking my meds,

62
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:01,056
because nothing is wrong with me. No
reason to keep dragging me back here.

63
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,494
When I'm on them, everything slows
down, that's when the problem is.

64
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,861
Hey, nice to see you.

65
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,399
My roomie last time
couldn't stand me.

66
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,525
Really?

67
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,432
I'm Juan Alvarez.
J.A.'s my stage name,

68
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,801
but Alvie's what everybody
around here calls me.

69
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,136
<i>Like the Woody Allen
character in Annie Hall,</i>

70
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,302
but the Puerto Rican version
and not as neurotic.

71
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,539
So, what do I call you?

72
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,808
You're actually waiting
for an answer this time?

73
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,008
You can call me House.

74
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,382
<i>He's a brick house</i>

75
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:31,817
Hey, wait up.

76
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,054
I've already got the whole place
wired, so I'll give you the rundown.

77
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:39,121
Yo, everybody, this is
my new roomie House, y'all.

78
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,132
Main thing you gotta know...
Is this a line?

79
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,725
Hey, Gabby, meet my 
new roommate, House.

80
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:44,997
You can call him Hizzy.

81
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,163
No, you can't.

82
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,797
Don't worry, she won't
call you anything.

83
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,434
She hasn't talked in like
10 years or something.

84
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,968
Good you came here. You need
to know the lay of the land.

85
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,604
I need to request a new room.

86
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,046
You're funny.

87
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,777
You're also gonna come
here to get your meds.

88
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:00,079
I'm not on any meds.

89
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,586
You either?
Good for you.

90
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,144
Tell me my mind
works too fast,

91
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:05,816
probably tell Usain Bolt
he runs too fast.

92
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:09,760
Excuse me. I know you're busy
ignoring me, but my mini-bar is empty.

93
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,694
You think Bolt could
do the long jump?

94
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,822
That sport
needs to evolve,

95
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,129
had the same world record
for like 20 years.

96
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,726
I think if one guy
launched himself head first

97
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,705
and right before he hits the
ground does a front flip instead,

98
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,365
get three extra feet
out of that, easy.

99
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,433
Go be that man.

100
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,979
My head!

101
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,914
My head!

102
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:37,287
You're not getting
any Haldol. Sorry.

103
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,919
That's Hal. His real name is Connor,
but we call him Hal because...

104
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,551
Yeah. I got it.

105
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,899
We can't play that.
They keep it locked up.

106
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,024
I wish we could,
but at the same time,

107
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,295
you can imagine
how annoying that could be.

108
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,859
Crazy people playing 
on it all the time.

109
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,303
We'd never
get any peace.

110
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,067
Come on, I want to
introduce you to everybody.

111
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:58,400
You think
he's serious?

112
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,845
He's a doctor. He knows that acting
out will only reinforce our diagnosis.

113
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,575
Or it'll work.

114
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,945
You actually think this is something
we should be concerned about?

115
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,647
A patient makes a threat, you
should always be concerned.

116
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:20,856
There are two new additions to
our ward. You all know Alvie.

117
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:21,922
Thank you.
Thank you.

118
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,561
Hold your applause. It's great
to be back here in Mayfield.

119
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:27,299
Not just for the food,
not just for the ladies...

120
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:29,603
Well, okay, maybe
just for the ladies.

121
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,439
And you should also
welcome Greg to the floor.

122
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,174
Don't worry about the name.
Just passing through.

123
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,715
I don't want to
break any hearts.

124
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,340
Can we go outside now?

125
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,543
Not now, Jay.

126
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:43,111
So he's claustrophobic, right?
You're claustrophobic.

127
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,180
Can I get a pen
to write this stuff down?

128
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,724
Where are you going?
Where's he going?

129
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:49,783
It's okay.

130
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,295
Paranoid. Check.

131
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:55,628
Dr. Beasley, I'm having
an issue with the food.

132
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,827
What's the problem?

133
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,734
I swear I'm eating
less and less

134
00:08:58,804 --> 00:09:01,432
and I just keep getting
bigger and bigger.

135
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,667
A crayon, anybody?

136
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,573
We'll talk about it
another time.

137
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,511
I understand you all had
art therapy yesterday.

138
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,174
Maybe we can hang some of
the new pieces on the wall.

139
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,046
Cut your wrists, huh?

140
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:13,715
Greg, there are
certain topics...

141
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:16,311
Oh. I'm sorry,
is suicide taboo?

142
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:21,253
Gosh, if I've broken a rule on
my first day, I will kill myself.

143
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,056
Group's over.

144
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:26,162
That flew by.

145
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,100
You realize you're not the first
uncooperative patient on this floor?

146
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:31,761
Really? Is there a club?

147
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:35,329
Yes. Come with me
to the clubhouse.

148
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:40,939
That didn't take long.

149
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,139
I'm that good.

150
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,754
Come on, come on, come on.

151
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,521
Come on, Alvie,
let's see some action.

152
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,899
Me! Me! Me!
Pass. Pass. Pass.

153
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,161
Good!

154
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,929
Come on, guys.

155
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,206
Ready to play nice?

156
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,969
Would you believe me
if I said yes?

157
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:11,100
No.

158
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:13,008
Then yes.

159
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,981
You do know
I'm trying to help you.

160
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:21,210
I also know you're trying to
be sweet, caring and effective.

161
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,879
You're just not.

162
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,155
You want out.
Just talk, be honest,

163
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:32,395
try to work with people,
try to deal with people.

164
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,395
Okay.

165
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:42,734
House! House!
He's on my team.

166
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,776
Shut up.
Nobody likes you.

167
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,443
Hey. Am I crowding you?
What?

168
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,141
Can't see the sun?

169
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:52,447
Oh, no.
Everything's closing in.

170
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,748
Okay. Okay.

171
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,815
He's the claustrophobic one,
right?

172
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,584
Because I'm doing
this from memory.

173
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,714
You have to dribble.

174
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:01,817
Why?

175
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,091
CIA satellites aren't watching
me, they're watching you

176
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,257
'cause you're
wearing green.

177
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,729
That one was
just too easy.

178
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,536
Seriously, anorexia? Were
you supposed to be a girl?

179
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,236
And in answer to
your implicit question,

180
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,074
yes, those pants
do make you look fat.

181
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,052
How upset were you
when you woke up in the ER

182
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,818
and you were still
alive and a failure?

183
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,691
Two-nothing,
good guys.

184
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,437
You're right. It is
rewarding to reach out.

185
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,140
You can't go up there.
It's yard time right now.

186
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,809
Put it on my tab.

187
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,838
I think you'll find music
therapy is more effective

188
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,569
if the patients are
inside to hear it.

189
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,738
Where'd you get the key?

190
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,278
They gave it to me.

191
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,515
So, if she ever talks, are
we gonna get a German accent?

192
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:44,086
No. She's my
husband's sister.

193
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,457
So let him come
play the piano.

194
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,558
He doesn't
know how to play.

195
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,998
Nice. A little heavy
on the right foot, though.

196
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,945
See her head?
It bobs to the music.

197
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,180
It's the only real reaction
I'm getting from her.

198
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,087
Feels like we're talking.

199
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,622
You're not talking.

200
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,792
Her head is bobbing
to her pulse.

201
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:20,058
Are you a new doctor
on the ward?

202
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,531
Technically, yes.

203
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,435
Can I lead this time?

204
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,132
Come on.

205
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,608
Leave the lid unlocked
when you're done.

206
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,476
Can you close the door? You're
letting all the cool air out.

207
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,816
If you keep up this
scorched earth policy,

208
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,943
you're gonna end up
living in this room.

209
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,212
Are you ready
to try another strategy

210
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,222
or do you want me
to leave you in here?

211
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,235
Twenty-one. Two-one. That's
game. Hey, House is back.

212
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,003
I'll get the ball.

213
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,409
Come on. I need some meat.
I got no one left to play.

214
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,503
I'll play you.

215
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,310
Pssh, girl. Come on,
House. You can serve.

216
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:51,385
I had some time to think about
the approach I've been taking.

217
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,224
I'm new, I'm unhappy here, and
I've been taking it out on you guys.

218
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:00,529
Unfairly.

219
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:05,561
It was misdirected anger.

220
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:12,700
'Cause when you think about it,
the real jerks here are the doctors.

221
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,336
House.

222
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,242
You see how they give
you a ping-pong table,

223
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:20,410
but no paddles, no net.

224
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,044
It's like they're mocking you.

225
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,213
Preach.

226
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:26,258
The game is called table
tennis not table volleyball.

227
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,384
Greg, you know where
this is gonna end.

228
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,928
Whoever saw a tennis
court without a net?

229
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:34,329
A little run-down park across
from my apartment, growing up.

230
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,494
Three courts, no nets,
no one ever used it.

231
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,333
No one's gonna try to hang
themselves with a ping-pong net.

232
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,805
Of course not.
That's ridiculous.

233
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,671
It ain't right, Doc. You
treat us like little kids.

234
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:47,143
Little kids are allowed to play
ping-pong, they can play the piano.

235
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,407
Yeah, worse
than little kids.

236
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,678
All right. Why don't we just
go and sit down and discuss it?

237
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:55,242
No, no, no! No! I want
to discuss it right here!

238
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,719
Guys.

239
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:01,920
Guys.

240
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,426
Guys!

241
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,299
We want...

242
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:33,421
House is right. I think
everyone here can handle these.

243
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,932
Seriously?

244
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,133
Is that your strategy? Give
everybody what they want, except me?

245
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,173
You're a natural leader.

246
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,798
You could do something
useful down here.

247
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,503
For them.
Definitely for you.

248
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,978
Or we could keep fighting.

249
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,481
If you think
you can break me,

250
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,315
if you think I'm not every
bit as stubborn as you.

251
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,560
<i>He came to fight the Man
And he had the master plan</i>

252
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:16,158
<i>But it started to unravel Nolan
smashed him with his gavel like...</i>

253
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,532
Shut up.

254
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:20,168
So, you're gonna keep trying
to make them miserable?

255
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,467
No.

256
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,632
New plan?

257
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,800
Yep.

258
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,571
What is it?

259
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:26,872
I don't know yet.

260
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:30,843
<i>His mind is burning
The wheels are turning</i>

261
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,281
<i>The butter is churning</i>

262
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,717
<i>You think Nolan can keep
House from strolling?</i>

263
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:38,245
You know, it's easier to come
up with a new plan in silence.

264
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:39,790
Right. Cool.

265
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,062
Can I hum?

266
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:57,942
I'd like you all to welcome another
new addition to our ward. Steve.

267
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,568
Freedom Master.

268
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:02,311
Steve Elkerton's
just a cover.

269
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,906
It's like Clark Kent or
Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker.

270
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,679
Cool, we get more Jesuses
than superheroes.

271
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,778
Well, I try to blend in,
in the outside world,

272
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,313
but I figure in here
everybody gets it.

273
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,360
Hey, we're living
in the Ward of Justice.

274
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,451
Alvie.

275
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,224
Can you explain a little more
about what you think everybody gets?

276
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,233
That there's good
and evil in the world.

277
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,394
And some people
are special,

278
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,995
and they're chosen to help
keep evil forces at bay.

279
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,472
You don't think
you can stop bullets, do you?

280
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,566
I move out of their way.

281
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:33,372
Can you read minds?

282
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,938
No.

283
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,110
Group time, Greg.

284
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,983
Why isn't she talking?

285
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,819
She needs help. She needs
somebody to save her.

286
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:51,488
That's what we're
all trying to do.

287
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:56,757
Let's take five minutes.
Everybody get to know Steve.

288
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,038
I can fly.

289
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,144
I know you're scheming,

290
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,181
working on your next elaborate
plan to get out of here.

291
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:15,283
Why don't you put the plan on hold
for a few days, see what happens?

292
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,084
Just let me do my job.

293
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,651
If you prefer private to group, we
can do that, maybe try some SSRIs.

294
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:27,392
If you think nothing's working, you
can always go back to your schemes.

295
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,832
God, if only you'd said
that two minutes ago,

296
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:33,360
before I came up with my new
scheme. Now I'm committed.

297
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,901
Get it?

298
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:38,943
<i>Shaq up in my area</i>

299
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:41,275
<i>I'm a better baller
and a better rapper, what?</i>

300
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,746
<i>And I'm good
at basketball, too!</i>

301
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,343
Do you have
third-floor privileges?

302
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,946
Ever since I shared in group
about my uncle fondling me.

303
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,749
Is that true?
Yeah.

304
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:56,760
And now I can use the
third-floor vending machines.

305
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,261
Do you eat sour cream
and onion chips?

306
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,627
I mean, the whole point is the dipping.

307
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,029
Sure, we save
time by not adding

308
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:02,828
the mix to the sour cream,
but you're missing out...

309
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,994
I need you to break
into Nolan's office.

310
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,298
Commando style.

311
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,895
I want you to focus.

312
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,167
You want me
to mess him up?

313
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,471
Go into Nolan's office,
look at his calendar.

314
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,773
I need the name of the woman
he met with at 11:00 today.

315
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,938
No problem. And I'll get
you some old-school chips.

316
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:17,538
If they have them,
I'll get you some dip,

317
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:18,810
but I've never seen dip
in the vending machine...

318
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,546
Yes, get me chips
and dip. What else?

319
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,712
I get it, I get it.

320
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,779
Plan B.
"B" is for blackmail.

321
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,552
I got you covered.
Commando style.

322
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:12,662
Let me go! I just wanted a
little snack. That ain't right.

323
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:15,901
Yo, I didn't know the machine
was moved. I want some Ritz Bits.

324
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,909
Yo, I might be pregnant.
I get these cravings.

325
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,774
You get the name?

326
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,843
Nolan's schedule book just has a big "X"
marking out the whole middle of the day.

327
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,185
Then we can assume the girl
he's with is called "Nooner. "

328
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,249
<i>Nooner, nooner
Nolan's gonna spoon her</i>

329
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,316
He's gonna fork her.

330
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,659
<i>And then he's
gonna knife her</i>

331
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,622
I didn't get a chance to check
the phone or anything else.

332
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,032
That's okay.
I got her license plate.

333
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,364
I call my friend,
he gets the name,

334
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,302
I get the letter that
gets me out of here.

335
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,135
You got phone privileges?

336
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,040
I'm on level minus four. I'm
still writing with a crayon.

337
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:54,135
You?
You gotta be a level five.

338
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:55,975
That's like the top
of the Space Needle.

339
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:58,846
Hal's the only one
that's up that high.

340
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:00,179
Hal's a level five?

341
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,812
They give him a point every
time he clears his plate.

342
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,321
I've been eating
his potatoes.

343
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,651
Will he sell you
some minutes?

344
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,885
No, I pay two cigarettes
for the potatoes.

345
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,859
Phone's worth a lot more.

346
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,927
Can you cheek a pill?

347
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,159
No.

348
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,836
That's too bad for you.

349
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,109
You sure
you're good with this?

350
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,512
Yeah, yeah.
Gotta be done.

351
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,981
So, how do we start?

352
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:38,355
I think we just start.
Make it good. Make it real.

353
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,387
Just do it already.

354
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,069
Code Gray!

355
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:56,733
Give me
five milligrams of Haldol!

356
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:01,873
Get him off me! Hey!

357
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,479
Give it to him.

358
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,901
Dude, that was awesome.

359
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,146
You think Hal will
mind if they're wet?

360
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,117
<i>House?</i>

361
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,685
No, it's your other
friend at the asylum.

362
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:54,053
How's it going?

363
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:56,566
Hallucinations are gone,
so is the Vicodin.

364
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,502
How's the leg?
How's the pain?

365
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,402
<i>They got me on
some non-narcotic.</i>

366
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,406
I'm dealing. I need you
to run a license plate.

367
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,739
Was there a hit-and-run
on your floor?

368
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,108
House, just do
what you're supposed to do,

369
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,980
listen to the doctors, and
I'll be able to visit soon.

370
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:17,579
Track down the owner of this car and I'll be
able to visit you. In your office. Tomorrow.

371
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:21,615
My doctor's too smart, too old, and too
well-dressed to only be running one ward.

372
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,426
<i>He screwed up
something in his life,</i>

373
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,689
<i>and I think
he's doing it again.</i>

374
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:27,057
I need her name, so I can
blackmail the blackmailer.

375
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,690
House, he called me.

376
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,762
What did he want to know?

377
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,032
He wanted to know about you.

378
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:40,073
<i>He wanted to warn me that
you'd be calling for something,</i>

379
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:44,548
and he told me if I wanted to help you
get better, I had to let him do his job.

380
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,582
Yeah, well, now I'm calling you
to tell you that if he calls you...

381
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:51,247
House, I'm so sorry.
I wish I could help you.

382
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,752
You can.

383
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:04,733
Turns out,

384
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:08,762
You're my only friend.

385
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:14,241
<i>House ain't a newbie
Now he's living on this floor</i>

386
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,378
And I hate you.

387
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,216
I'm gonna cooperate.

388
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,947
That's not much of a plan.
That's actually their plan.

389
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,823
No. I'm pretty sure their plan is
for me to actually swallow the pills,

390
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,919
to actually cooperate.

391
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,959
I'm so proud
of my little roomie.

392
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,520
I only taught him
everything he knows.

393
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,099
One, two, three.

394
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:49,372
Okay, Stomp, you start the
betting. Highest card wins.

395
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,975
That's probably
a fold. Richter?

396
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,269
Two cigarettes.

397
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,008
He's not confident, Alvie.

398
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,677
You can crush him. In the
form of a rhyme if you wanted.

399
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,117
<i>No regrets
Raise 10 cigarettes</i>

400
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:07,522
Whoa. That's a lot of nerve for
someone with a two on their head.

401
00:27:07,592 --> 00:27:08,923
You're messing with me.

402
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,155
You can't raise 10,
I only have five.

403
00:27:11,229 --> 00:27:12,218
Throw in your phone card.

404
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,390
I'm not gonna throw
in my phone card.

405
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,831
Can I play?

406
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,362
Come here.
Why?

407
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,929
I want to see if you've
got what it takes.

408
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,167
Give me your best poker face.

409
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,611
Too rich for my blood.
You can take my seat.

410
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,445
Med time!

411
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:33,612
How are you
feeling today?

412
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,176
Better than yesterday,
not as good as tomorrow.

413
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,603
I've been humming to her.

414
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,476
She sways.
Might be significant.

415
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,081
Are you ignoring me or are you
just letting my charm wash over you?

416
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,055
Kind of tough
to play and chat.

417
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,093
Couple of weeks ago,
you told me

418
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,925
playing to her was
a complete waste of time.

419
00:28:19,931 --> 00:28:23,423
You're right. Your playing
does get worse when you talk.

420
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,327
I assume she loved music.

421
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:30,397
She played for the Philadelphia
Philharmonic. Cello.

422
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:34,905
If she responded to the piano, she
might respond even better to the cello.

423
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:36,875
I play a little.

424
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,842
Hmm.

425
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:43,547
Maybe I'll bring one
in Tuesday. Thank you.

426
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,154
Different desk.
Different doctor.

427
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,821
You've been on meds
for a while now.

428
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,230
I'll be checking in with you periodically
to see if we need to adjust your dose.

429
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,861
Any dry mouth?
Trouble sleeping?

430
00:28:58,937 --> 00:28:59,961
No.

431
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,798
Can I go now?
There's a manic out there

432
00:29:02,874 --> 00:29:06,207
with a fresh carton of cigarettes
and he's a terrible bluffer.

433
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,010
It's nice to see that you
and Alvie are friends again.

434
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,105
Tell me about your fight.

435
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:13,207
He hit me, I hit him back.

436
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,013
Repeat until pulpy.

437
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,520
Alvie told me you
instigated the thing.

438
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,454
That tends to be
the way fights work.

439
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,992
Different interpretations
of the same circumstances.

440
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,721
Very understanding attitude.

441
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:24,853
There's that tone again.

442
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,396
You're smart.

443
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:29,922
How come every time you compliment
me, it sounds like an accusation?

444
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:32,970
You're not having any side-effects
from your meds, which is unusual.

445
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,129
It's not that unusual.

446
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,467
The story about the fight
isn't adding up.

447
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,737
Why don't you stop pretending that
you haven't reached a conclusion?

448
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:42,109
You don't trust me. Actually,
it's more fundamental than that.

449
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,169
You don't like me.

450
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,272
I didn't say that.

451
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,180
You think I'm not
taking my meds.

452
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,242
Are you?
Yes.

453
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,949
So, what do you want me to do?
Want me to take a urine test?

454
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,957
Will that earn your trust?

455
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,025
Actually, yeah.

456
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,372
Have at it.

457
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,303
A little dignity, please.

458
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:13,674
You know the rules.
I have to watch.

459
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:17,806
Yes, but you don't have to have court
side seats. Can I at least use a stall?

460
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:46,971
<i>For he himself has said it</i>

461
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:51,641
<i>And it's greatly to his credit</i>

462
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:55,812
<i>That he is an Englishman</i>

463
00:30:55,887 --> 00:31:01,018
<i>He is</i>

464
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:05,495
<i>An Englishman</i>

465
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,108
Get it while it's hot.

466
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,194
I'm sorry I doubted you.

467
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,593
Freedom Master, think
you could help me out?

468
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,070
You need help?
Of course. That's what I do.

469
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:50,937
Great. Could you move
the piano for me?

470
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:55,369
Five hundred pounds
is not too much, is it?

471
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,607
Is there something
trapped underneath or...

472
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,775
No, I just want to move
it away from the window.

473
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:01,341
I'm sorry, my powers
aren't for frivolous...

474
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,319
Just one quick lift.

475
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:04,377
Why are you doing that?

476
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,616
House, it's none
of your business.

477
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:11,525
I'm just curious, as a
doctor. What are you doing?

478
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,962
Either he is Freedom Master
and he shouldn't be here

479
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,865
or else he's suffering from a
serious and dangerous delusion

480
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,459
that he needs
to deal with.

481
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,232
So legit medical reasons.

482
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,938
You're not just trying to break the
guy because he's a little different.

483
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:26,909
He's not different,
he's delusional.

484
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:28,002
Can you help me out?

485
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,273
What is she looking at?

486
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,907
You're not
a superhero, Steven.

487
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:34,076
You're just a regular person,
that's okay. I can save her.

488
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,484
We're all just regular people.
It's what we do with that...

489
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,217
They stole her voice box.
They have it in there.

490
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,522
That's what she's staring at.
That's what she's staring at.

491
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,618
She's always staring at...

492
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,687
Your wife is dead.

493
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,502
Good can defeat evil.

494
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:57,302
Not every time. Evil people killed
a lot of good people that day.

495
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:59,400
You couldn't save her.
No one could save her.

496
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:05,940
It's in there. Her voice is in
there. Her voice is in there.

497
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:07,382
Code Gray.

498
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,817
Her voice is in...

499
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:14,314
Her voice is in there!
Her voice is in there!

500
00:33:19,864 --> 00:33:21,161
Don't do it.

501
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,665
I'm not doing anything.

502
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,133
You're thinking.

503
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,296
Things go from thinking to
doing way too fast in this place.

504
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,806
Keep thinking, you're gonna
wind up with no mo in your mojo.

505
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,273
I'm thinking
of hitting you again.

506
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:34,277
You hate Medina, you hate all
of them, you want to hurt them.

507
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,711
You gotta keep pretending.
Step away from the hate.

508
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:41,013
What's the difference between
pretending to cooperate and cooperating?

509
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:44,054
Pretending is pretending. It's
not real, you don't mean it.

510
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,182
I sat and watched while he did
something stupid and pointless.

511
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,316
I cooperated.

512
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:51,556
In a few days, you won't have to
watch because you're going home.

513
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,062
You'll be getting
your job back.

514
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,493
Everybody, inside.

515
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:59,502
Closing ceremonies, everyone
attends. One of you is going home.

516
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,907
It's been a great week.

517
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,741
A number of you have made
tremendous strides.

518
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:12,715
But today we're here
to congratulate Susan.

519
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:20,381
We are proud of her. We
wish her well and we hope

520
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:23,791
to never see her again.
To never see her again.

521
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,729
Isn't it pretty?

522
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,909
Where's Freedom Master?

523
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:47,575
He isn't able to take part.

524
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:02,395
Get out there. He said
everybody has to get out there.

525
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,367
Talk. Say something.

526
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,960
Dr. House,
leave him alone.

527
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,869
Did you drug him?

528
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,202
Of course
I didn't drug him.

529
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,970
He's in flat affect.
He's practically catatonic.

530
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,068
Hey, we got cake.

531
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,203
He's fine.

532
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,746
Double chocolate.
Yummy, yummy.

533
00:35:16,814 --> 00:35:19,248
Don't tell me that
he's fine! You did this!

534
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:21,512
He was functioning.
He was happy.

535
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:23,019
He was delusional.

536
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,816
Yeah. He's way better off now.

537
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,049
Dr. House.

538
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,357
Let's talk.

539
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,323
Thinking sucks.

540
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:43,140
I'm not allowed to get
angry? They screwed him up.

541
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,765
And for the record,

542
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,310
I am two privilege
levels above Susan.

543
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:49,005
I got the same
depression scale score.

544
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,913
Every patient is different. It's
not about scores and levels and...

545
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,781
Happiness is happiness, the test
is the test, coping is coping.

546
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:57,377
And you think you're...
Absolutely!

547
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,287
I need to address
some deeper issues,

548
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,952
which I could do on
an outpatient basis.

549
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,221
Three hours a week?

550
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,957
That's just my opening offer. If you
want to counter, I'll likely fold.

551
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:08,020
No.

552
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,329
"No" is not an argument.

553
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,425
You trying to frustrate me?

554
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,560
No.

555
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,537
"No" again?

556
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,869
I can cope. I'm coping.

557
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,876
In fact, I'm coping
better than you think.

558
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:24,615
I've not been taking
my meds. Not one.

559
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,345
And yet I still scored a
"high-functioning" on your depression test.

560
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,047
So your proof of your
well-being is that you lied?

561
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,680
Manipulated.

562
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,690
My proof is that I can fool
the test, I can fool you,

563
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,091
which means
I am high-functioning.

564
00:36:37,161 --> 00:36:40,289
I'm sane, rational, capable.
I should not be here.

565
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,525
These are your
pills from today?

566
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,330
I'm not gonna take it.
I'll just cheek it again.

567
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,170
Lick it.

568
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,804
You want me
to lick your hand.

569
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,367
I washed.

570
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,981
It's sugar.

571
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:06,221
Your test results were improving
too regularly and too quickly.

572
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:08,053
I was concerned that you
weren't taking your pills,

573
00:37:08,125 --> 00:37:11,959
that it was all an act. So
I switched you to a placebo

574
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,659
to see if your improvements
would continue.

575
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,497
Your psych tests
told me nothing,

576
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,632
but your urine tests
told me you were faking.

577
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,713
You need to stop
fighting the system.

578
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,680
You need to let me
do my job.

579
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,449
So, what's the next plan?

580
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,257
There is no new plan.

581
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,655
I'm out of plans.

582
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,222
So, what do we do?

583
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,631
We stop talking.

584
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,239
I see you got some
cello in your trunk.

585
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,101
No, it's not a euphemism.

586
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,405
Are you spying on me?

587
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,278
I'm living in
a psychiatric hospital.

588
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,114
Staring out of the window
is what we do.

589
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,711
I assume you'll need
help carrying it up.

590
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,689
I still got
grounds privileges.

591
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,790
And who's going to carry you
when you're carrying the cello?

592
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:54,797
Yes, cast aside the useless
cripple. How very German of you.

593
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:59,495
Seriously. The thing weighs a ton with
that case. I think I'll need a dolly.

594
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,903
Or we could ask
Clark Kent to pitch in.

595
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,300
The dolly's
probably easier.

596
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:08,539
The dolly already
feels good about itself.

597
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:13,047
He was a happy-go-lucky superhero
until they told him he has no powers.

598
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,745
You let him help out,
he feels good about himself,

599
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,811
might be less depressed.

600
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,754
So, why do you
put your life on hold

601
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,955
to visit your sister-in-law
five times a week?

602
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,024
Am I somehow a bad person
for showing compassion?

603
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,332
No. You're not even a bad person
for lying about why you're doing it.

604
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:40,367
Oh, that is impressive.
That is a superhuman feat.

605
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:47,444
Why don't you take a rest before
you fly that thing up to the ward?

606
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,290
He's still depressed.
Give me your car keys.

607
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,884
You gonna dangle them in
front of him to entertain him?

608
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,691
I'm gonna make him
feel like he's flying.

609
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:03,860
I'll just drive him around the
grounds, top down, wind in his hair.

610
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:08,664
Seriously? You're
gonna say no to that?

611
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,151
Why are you
so nice to me?

612
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,249
I think you have
a good heart.

613
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:31,689
Would you still be nice to
me if I told you that I lied?

614
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,022
I'm not just driving around
the grounds in your convertible.

615
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,658
I'm kidnapping him
and stealing your car.

616
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,003
You sure?

617
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,602
I was just starting to feel
a little heat between us.

618
00:40:46,677 --> 00:40:48,975
Thought we had kind of a Bonnie
and Clyde thing going there.

619
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,378
Bonnie and Clyde
get shot to pieces.

620
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:54,081
Hmm. See you.

621
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:19,839
You can do this. And if you
hold my hand, I can do it, too.

622
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,301
Don't let go!

623
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,140
Going up!

624
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,618
Freedom Master is back!

625
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:17,193
Keep it down, Freedom Master,
you're scaring the good citizens.

626
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,330
That was the coolest
moment of my life.

627
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:20,802
It was fun.

628
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,533
You can repay me by
telling Nolan he's an idiot.

629
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:27,134
Smell that fresh air. And
the warmth of your yellow sun.

630
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,803
We do enjoy it.

631
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,480
Careful of the traffic. Don't
want to go damaging any fenders.

632
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,183
Hey! Hey!
Come on. Get down.

633
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:45,458
There's no cry for help.
There's no cat in a tree.

634
00:42:48,832 --> 00:42:49,890
Thank you, Greg.

635
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:52,526
No!

636
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,646
He's lucky to be alive.

637
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,882
He's got a lacerated spleen,
rotational pelvic fracture,

638
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,717
compound break
of the femur and humerus.

639
00:43:12,656 --> 00:43:15,591
Everything in your life has
been about finding the truth,

640
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:20,824
but suddenly, with this guy, you decide
to reinforce a sick man's delusions.

641
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,162
You just wanted to take
a swing at me. Hmm?

642
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:30,966
You don't care about getting
out, you don't care about him.

643
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:33,009
You don't even
care about the truth.

644
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,077
You don't care
about anything, House.

645
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:41,884
I'm transferring you
to Winslow Psychiatric.

646
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:46,150
You'll have better luck pulling
the wool over their eyes. I'm done.

647
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,187
Don't.

648
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:54,863
I need help.

649
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:15,885
So, how is this
supposed to work?

650
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,285
You sit. I sit. We talk.

651
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,656
About what?
About whatever you want.

652
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,351
You want me to whine
about my mother?

653
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,894
Do you want to whine
about your mother?

654
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:28,295
I could tell you about the time
I was five and my goldfish died.

655
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:30,924
If that's where
you'd like to start.

656
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,764
I've had a billion things
happen to me in my life,

657
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,531
how am I supposed to know
which ones are relevant?

658
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,300
As far as I'm concerned,
they're all relevant.

659
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:39,865
Well, we better get moving 'cause
this session could take 50 years.

660
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,241
Yes, you are the sum of
everything that's happened to you,

661
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:46,112
and, yes, some events are
more relevant than others,

662
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:51,010
but the only way we can figure
out which ones are is to talk.

663
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:53,613
So, tell me,
what's on your mind?

664
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:56,252
What do you want?

665
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:00,926
I want to get better.

666
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,061
Whatever the hell that means.

667
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:07,161
I'm sick of being miserable.

668
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:08,602
So you'd like to be happy?

669
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:11,072
Again with the reflecting.
Yes, I'd like to be happy.

670
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,234
Being happy is
an excellent goal.

671
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:15,210
Not many patients
can crystallize

672
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:16,837
exactly what they're
hoping to get out of this.

673
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,278
Well, bully for me.

674
00:45:18,348 --> 00:45:20,373
So, now all
we have to do

675
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:24,319
is figure out how to get
you from here to happy.

676
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:29,789
SSRIs? That's your
genius technique?

677
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,795
I don't think we should
ignore any tools that can help.

678
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:34,831
I know you don't have
a problem taking drugs.

679
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,832
For my leg. For pain.

680
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,334
Well, think of this
as being for psychic pain.

681
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,867
I don't want to
change who I am.

682
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:45,966
Miserable?

683
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:54,241
You think that by taking
meds you'll lose your edge?

684
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,084
Stop making the unique connections
that make you a successful doctor?

685
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,089
If Van Gogh
was your patient,

686
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:02,921
<i>he'd be satisfied painting houses
instead of the Starry Night.</i>

687
00:46:02,993 --> 00:46:06,952
Van Gogh would still be making
inspired paintings of the night sky,

688
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:09,294
just maybe not from
the room of his asylum.

689
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,390
You don't know that.

690
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,402
I know both his ears
would be intact.

691
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:17,504
And I know his life
would be better.

692
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,685
I know this doesn't
come naturally to you,

693
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:36,490
but you want my help, which
means you need to trust me.

694
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,330
Hmm.

695
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,339
Delicious.

696
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:03,313
Why are you here?

697
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:06,654
Waiting for my
communion wafer.

698
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,295
You're cheeking it, right?

699
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,127
Nope.

700
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,593
Tell me you're
cheeking it.

701
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,894
I swallowed it.

702
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,405
No, you didn't.
We don't take meds.

703
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:24,838
You don't take meds, Alvie.

704
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:26,671
I decided to get sane.

705
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,802
You're scamming again.
You can tell me.

706
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,347
I'm not scamming, Alvie.

707
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,076
They broke you.

708
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:39,988
They didn't break me.
I am broken.

709
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:45,856
And stop worshipping me and go
worry about your own loser life.

710
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:51,423
I hate you.

711
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:03,802
Prom?

712
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,246
Got an assignment for you.

713
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:06,839
Role playing?

714
00:48:08,085 --> 00:48:10,019
I'm not sure how pretending
to be a businessman

715
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:13,318
with a foot fetish is
going to help, but I'm game.

716
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,689
Have you connected with
any of the other patients?

717
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,022
You've been here
four weeks.

718
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:21,428
Tell me about your relationships
with the other patients.

719
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:25,559
Diane is convinced
that Silent Girl hates her.

720
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:27,331
Richter is not as
paranoid as you think,

721
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,634
he just likes
that you think that,

722
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:31,139
and my roommate hates me.

723
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:32,402
Only one of the
things you said

724
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,673
indicated how somebody else
feels about you. So...

725
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:41,079
I'm sure they've done some form
of rudimentary analysis on me,

726
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:42,277
concluded that I'm a jerk.

727
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:45,219
You know, there is a way for
them to find out things about you

728
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:47,120
without deductive reasoning.

729
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,748
I have had relationships.

730
00:48:48,825 --> 00:48:50,884
You've screwed up
relationships.

731
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,862
Every one of them.
Almost like that was the goal.

732
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:58,493
I want you to trust people.

733
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,235
Try.

734
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,909
Get dressed.

735
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:27,319
Just open up?

736
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:31,392
Just open up. Trust.

737
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,536
Strangers?

738
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,696
We'll start with strangers,
then work our way up.

739
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:42,141
If it helps, I find "Hello"
to be an excellent ice breaker.

740
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:52,481
Hi.

741
00:49:54,224 --> 00:49:55,486
Hi.

742
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,089
It's like hello,
only shorter.

743
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:00,856
Yes.

744
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,590
Glad we were able
to save that time.

745
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,760
Judging by the fancy suit,
I'd say you were a donor,

746
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,136
but the nervous demeanor says
maybe you've had issues,

747
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,506
probably that's why this
place has personal meaning.

748
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,869
But this is supposed
to be about me.

749
00:50:18,115 --> 00:50:20,447
I take advantage
of my friends.

750
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:24,916
Friend, really.
I've only got one.

751
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:28,382
It can be tough sometimes.

752
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,550
I'm not gay.

753
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:30,615
Neither am I.

754
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,355
Actually, I am.

755
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:34,453
See that guy over there?

756
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:38,963
He's my lover.
He's also my psychiatrist.

757
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,061
Which some would argue
is a little inappropriate,

758
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:44,369
but they just don't know
what love is. Am I right?

759
00:50:50,247 --> 00:50:52,215
You're not gay.
No.

760
00:50:52,282 --> 00:50:55,342
But I have to tell
intimate secrets to people.

761
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,677
Maybe they should be true.

762
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,484
Hadn't thought of that.

763
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,684
To be on the safe side,
I should probably do both.

764
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:06,490
Starting with the fun ones.
Come on, let's get me better.

765
00:51:16,339 --> 00:51:17,363
Hi.

766
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:18,932
Hi.

767
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,642
I'm a philanderer.

768
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:27,110
Oh.

769
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:29,243
Philanderer doesn't mean
that I give a lot to charity,

770
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,308
it means...

771
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,752
I know what it means.

772
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:37,620
You were asking me if there were
any nuts in the hors d'oeuvres.

773
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:38,752
What?

774
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:40,757
Honey.

775
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,660
What did my husband
just say to you?

776
00:51:46,636 --> 00:51:52,905
I was asking him if there were
nuts in the hors d'oeuvres.

777
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,567
Then where
is your EpiPen?

778
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:55,736
My what?

779
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:58,940
No one with an allergy would
walk around without an EpiPen.

780
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,312
Give me your purse.
No.

781
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,044
Give me your purse.
Stop. No.

782
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,555
What really
happened is...

783
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:10,683
I thought he was cute.
I hit on him.

784
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,954
We're going.

785
00:52:20,036 --> 00:52:21,560
You having fun?

786
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,333
I did connect with one guy,

787
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:29,876
but then my propensity for
screwing things up overtook me.

788
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,746
Then my desire to have fun
overcame my propensity.

789
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,751
You didn't screw it up.

790
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,084
The assignment wasn't to get you to
trust people with a piece of your soul,

791
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,387
the assignment was to teach
you that you can trust.

792
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:47,458
Did any of these people rat you
out as the obnoxious womanizer

793
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:50,500
or the porn producer
that they think you are?

794
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:56,534
Why do you think that people would
treat you worse if they knew the truth?

795
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,907
Good night, Doctor.

796
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:08,211
Are you in trouble?

797
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,351
Apparently not.

798
00:53:12,422 --> 00:53:15,585
So, what's next?
You wanna be my pimp?

799
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,387
Why don't we just talk?

800
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,026
Okay.

801
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:29,663
How come you weren't pissed
at me for stealing your car?

802
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:32,772
It was a nice thing to do.

803
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:36,903
Hmm. I'm not sure about the
German-English translation of "nice. "

804
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:42,282
The stealing was nice or the
ruining of Freedom Master's life?

805
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:47,680
What you did was misguided
and irresponsible,

806
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,355
but it was also nice.

807
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:53,589
You gave him a moment
of pure happiness.

808
00:53:56,967 --> 00:54:00,403
You asked me why I come
here so often to visit Annie.

809
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,700
She was my best friend.

810
00:54:04,774 --> 00:54:09,108
Then she started pulling
away from everybody.

811
00:54:10,146 --> 00:54:12,239
The doctors don't know why.

812
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:15,882
I think
I married her brother

813
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:21,822
because he was the only other one
who was going through the same thing.

814
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,221
But he stopped visiting
after a couple of years.

815
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:31,392
I just couldn't stop.

816
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,571
I miss her.

817
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:46,071
I should go.

818
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:49,718
Good night.

819
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,364
Good night.

820
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:25,248
So, what happened?

821
00:55:26,556 --> 00:55:27,648
You're talking to me now.

822
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:28,952
No.

823
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,531
Was it fun?

824
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:41,563
Yeah.

825
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,904
She kissed me.

826
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:56,918
Don't read into the phrasing.
We kissed each other.

827
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,180
And how do you
feel about that?

828
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:02,122
How do I feel about that? It was
a kiss. Kisses are good things.

829
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,152
Okay.

830
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,553
That was a loaded "okay. "

831
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:09,529
Not at all.
Why would you assume that?

832
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,624
You're being judgmental.

833
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:15,433
If I'd said that I had some delicious
Chilean sea bass for dinner last night,

834
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,302
would you say, "And how
do you feel about that?"

835
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,137
If the sea bass
was married, I might.

836
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:21,643
See,
you're being judgmental.

837
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,672
Isn't that against
your code or something?

838
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,443
I'm simply
stating the obvious.

839
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:28,848
It's complicated, not
just because she's married

840
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,751
and not just because
you're institutionalized.

841
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:36,087
I know you spent the last 12 hours
trying to figure out what that kiss means.

842
00:56:37,627 --> 00:56:41,256
Who was that woman you were
with in the parking lot?

843
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:43,025
When you deflect,

844
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,363
it's more effective when
you're not that transparent.

845
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:48,029
Obviously you have
no problem with infidelity.

846
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:52,507
You're trying to rationalize that if
it's okay for your doctor, it's okay.

847
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,043
But just for the record,
I am not having an affair.

848
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,204
Then who is she? Why do you
think you're working so hard

849
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,009
to figure out the details
of my personal life?

850
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,210
Might not have to work so hard if
there were some personal items in here.

851
00:57:02,285 --> 00:57:05,686
You've got one number
on speed dial, it says "Dad. "

852
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,552
Come on,
how old are you?

853
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:09,091
Why are you so afraid
to talk about this?

854
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,593
I want to talk about you. I want
to know who I'm taking advice from.

855
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,925
I'm not giving you advice,
I'm asking you questions.

856
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,932
I think that kiss meant a
lot. I think that scares you.

857
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,991
I think there are
no personal items in here

858
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,729
because you have
no personal life.

859
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:22,533
How do you think
you and Lydia will end?

860
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,573
You are a lonely man.

861
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:27,041
You've screwed up every
opportunity you've had in life.

862
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,941
What's the ending
to this story?

863
00:57:34,083 --> 00:57:35,573
I don't know.

864
00:57:39,756 --> 00:57:41,348
Visiting time.

865
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:02,740
Why did you kiss me?

866
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,444
How many
reasons are there?

867
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:14,854
I like you. It felt like a
nice way of showing you that.

868
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:06,335
How'd it
go with Lydia?

869
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:09,970
I found out she can only be happy
so long before the catatonic guy

870
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:15,279
with two broken limbs rolls off the
elevator. Philosophically speaking.

871
00:59:15,351 --> 00:59:18,843
Why do you value your failures
more than your successes?

872
00:59:18,922 --> 00:59:22,153
My mother caught me masturbating
to pictures of her mother.

873
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:24,557
Can we get past
these cute deflections?

874
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:29,994
Successes only last until someone
screws them up. Failures are forever.

875
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:32,034
So you accept that fact?

876
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:35,435
You accept that there's
nothing you can do?

877
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:37,973
Okay. I accept the fact
that there's nothing I can do.

878
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:39,668
Now what can I do?

879
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:43,940
You acknowledge failure
and you move past it.

880
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:45,809
You apologize.

881
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:47,442
Wow.

882
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,719
Powerful things,
these apologies.

883
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,620
You get someone
to jump off a building,

884
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:56,352
you say two words and you
move on with your life.

885
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,417
Hardly seems fair.

886
00:59:58,494 --> 00:59:59,756
Is that the issue?

887
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:05,259
You caused him pain.

888
01:00:07,303 --> 01:00:11,239
If the world is just,
you have to suffer equally?

889
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:17,403
You're not God, House.

890
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,247
You're just another screwed-up
human being who needs to move on.

891
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:27,946
Apologize to him.
Let yourself feel better.

892
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:34,289
Then you can learn to let
yourself keep feeling better.

893
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:01,051
Hey.

894
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:16,569
Dr. House.
Everything okay?

895
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,103
Yeah.

896
01:01:20,643 --> 01:01:23,976
Time for group.
Group time, everybody.

897
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,913
I have a surprise.

898
01:01:29,986 --> 01:01:34,218
Two weeks from today, we're going
to have the Mayfield Talent Show.

899
01:01:34,624 --> 01:01:36,888
Talent show?
Who's in it?

900
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:39,951
I'd really love it if everybody
here could participate.

901
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,553
But then
who's gonna watch?

902
01:01:41,631 --> 01:01:44,896
The staff will come.
Friends and family.

903
01:01:44,967 --> 01:01:46,093
Are you going to tape this?

904
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:47,568
No, it's just for us.

905
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,401
Well, if it's just for us,
I vote we don't do it.

906
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:55,308
Think of it as a fun way to
work on our therapeutic issues.

907
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,710
Alvie, maybe you could
sing one of your songs.

908
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,270
I don't sing, I rap.

909
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:01,816
Okay. Well, you can write
something just for us.

910
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:04,876
I don't write.
I just do. Freestyle style.

911
01:02:04,954 --> 01:02:06,785
I think you're gonna
wanna be prepared.

912
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:08,790
Make something special.

913
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:10,189
Always special.

914
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:13,922
How about you, Diane? Is there
something you'd like to do?

915
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:15,759
I don't have any talents.

916
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,665
Sure, you do.
You all do.

917
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:21,495
Steve, don't you think that
Diane has hidden talent

918
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,062
that we'd all like
to see come out?

919
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:27,606
You really think
he's going to answer?

920
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,474
Eventually.
Why?

921
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:32,670
Because things pass.

922
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,775
Things change,
doesn't mean they get better.

923
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:36,978
You gotta make
things better,

924
01:02:37,053 --> 01:02:39,613
you can't just keep talking
and hope for the best.

925
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,959
Diane, maybe you and I can work
together and figure something out.

926
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:48,925
I can save him.

927
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,863
"They stole her voice box. "
That's what he said.

928
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,096
That's what
she was staring at.

929
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:56,502
That's why he's staring.

930
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,267
Dr. House, please.

931
01:02:58,341 --> 01:02:59,638
Because there's
a music box in there.

932
01:02:59,709 --> 01:03:00,937
Orderly.

933
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,736
Come on,
just give it to me. I can...

934
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:08,614
I'm not having
a psychotic break.

935
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:10,311
I promise you this will work.

936
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:21,452
It's that blue box
on the top shelf.

937
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:29,103
This is what you wanted. This
is what you needed. A voice.

938
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:32,134
You thought you could cure
Silent Girl with this.

939
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,200
So by your own rationale,
it should cure you.

940
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,207
There's nothing wrong
with you. You're healing.

941
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:42,581
All the parts work.
Just speak.

942
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:45,884
Come on. Speak.
Say something.

943
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:48,549
I think maybe everyone
should take a break now.

944
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:01,064
You're trying to fix,
instead of moving on.

945
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:25,391
I brought Dvork.
Four hands.

946
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,558
What?

947
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,493
I need to know
what this is.

948
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:35,731
It's sheet music.

949
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:44,579
I told you. It's just
two people having fun.

950
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:47,982
There's two possible outcomes.

951
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:52,384
It ends, someone gets hurt, or it
doesn't end and someone gets hurt.

952
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,650
So the end sucks, it doesn't
mean the beginning has to.

953
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:02,859
Everything ends, life ends. It
doesn't mean that we can't enjoy it.

954
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,664
I can't...
I can't do this.

955
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:12,634
All I know is I was happy five
minutes ago, and now I'm not.

956
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,572
How is that better?

957
01:05:17,146 --> 01:05:18,670
Goodbye, Lydia.

958
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:28,721
I'm really worried
about ECT.

959
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:32,227
Apprehension's normal.
Has anyone else had it?

960
01:05:32,295 --> 01:05:34,126
They shocked me, man.

961
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:37,898
Thanks, that's
very reassuring.

962
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,000
I don't know if
I should do it.

963
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,663
Just do the treatment
or shut up.

964
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:44,103
Greg, there's a process.

965
01:05:44,173 --> 01:05:47,973
Yes, a process. Wouldn't want to
disrupt the process with results.

966
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:49,602
Hizzy had a rough
night last night.

967
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,671
Guess he decided to go back to
being an ass instead of a hypocrite.

968
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:54,477
Let's move on.

969
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:57,451
Alvie, are you making any
progress writing your rap?

970
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:01,889
Yeah. But really, no. I just
don't want to write my songs down,

971
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,621
it takes all the spontaneity out
of it, it's not of the moment.

972
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,094
Alvie, if you
write things down...

973
01:06:08,264 --> 01:06:12,360
<i>When the time comes, my rhyme
comes When my spotlight shines...</i>

974
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:16,693
Yeah. You're a genius.
Rhymes with penius.

975
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:21,141
Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Beasley.
Dr. Nolan asked me to give you this.

976
01:06:26,215 --> 01:06:27,546
Is this a day pass?

977
01:06:27,616 --> 01:06:29,049
He'd like to see you.

978
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,802
Thanks for coming.

979
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,103
I was hoping you could take
a look at my dad's chart.

980
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:57,739
A consult?
What happened?

981
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:00,441
You went through every
sane doctor in town?

982
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,780
I thought you wouldn't
mind getting off the ward.

983
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:09,755
The cleaning lady found
him on the kitchen floor.

984
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:14,023
Doctors here don't think that he'll
recover. That I should pull the plug.

985
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:18,328
I want a second opinion, so I
thought I'd be a fool not to call you.

986
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:25,771
Lacunar infarct converted
to hemorrhagic stroke.

987
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:30,334
He squashed his brain.
They didn't miss anything.

988
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:32,905
That's what I thought.

989
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:34,916
That's what you knew.

990
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:39,051
His brain has been
replaced by blood.

991
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:44,616
It's over, and it's obvious to any doctor
who looked at that scan. Even a shrink.

992
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,423
You want someone to tell you
that what you need to do is okay.

993
01:07:47,496 --> 01:07:49,987
You need permission.
Absolution.

994
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:51,795
Not now, House.

995
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,632
You have
no friends, no family.

996
01:07:55,704 --> 01:08:00,266
At some point, you made a
mistake, you lost everything.

997
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,770
And now I'm the closest
thing you got to a friend.

998
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,314
Just shut up.

999
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:11,711
I don't need you here
to play this game.

1000
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:05,799
I'm sorry
I pushed you away.

1001
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:09,507
It's what I do
when I'm afraid.

1002
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:14,642
Again, the German-English
translation may be a little off.

1003
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:20,550
I'm not crying
because of you.

1004
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:24,588
I'm crying because
I'm pathetic.

1005
01:09:26,228 --> 01:09:31,097
I brought her cello. In case she
magically wakes up for the show.

1006
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:34,199
Well, then I take
the apology back.

1007
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:40,234
We're all pathetic. It's what
makes everything interesting.

1008
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:42,937
I'm sick of life
being interesting.

1009
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:53,325
<i>You're nobody
'til somebody loves you</i>

1010
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:59,531
<i>You're nobody
'til somebody cares</i>

1011
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:40,174
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the
one, the only, Juan Alvarez!</i>

1012
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:49,550
<i>Yo, yo, what's up? Ward Six is
jumping off, y'all.</i>

1013
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:52,116
<i>Give it up for DJ Richter
on the ones and twos.</i>

1014
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:54,594
<i>Yo, DJ Richter, spin that.</i>

1015
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,768
<i>Welcome to Mayfield
Where the day feels long</i>

1016
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:05,306
<i>We act strong But there's
got to be something wrong</i>

1017
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:08,400
<i>See, we got hidden talents
You don't see hidden secrets</i>

1018
01:14:08,477 --> 01:14:11,105
<i>If we could show you those...</i>

1019
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:18,413
<i>If we could show you those...</i>

1020
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,124
<i>Then we wouldn't
have no regrets</i>

1021
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:35,262
<i>Wanna know my secret?
Sit back and let me explain it</i>

1022
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:38,101
<i>My Pop split, Momma got sick
Clich, ain't it?</i>

1023
01:14:38,173 --> 01:14:40,767
<i>Now I'm a manic Hispanic
I'm trying to make it work</i>

1024
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,209
<i>But the doctors
think I'm lazy...</i>

1025
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,546
<i>And my roommate is a jerk</i>

1026
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:56,248
<i>Dr. House is
in the house, y'all</i>

1027
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:59,317
<i>Give it up for Dr. House
to the stage, y'all</i>

1028
01:14:59,394 --> 01:15:02,557
<i>Paging Dr. House
to the stage, y'all</i>

1029
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:08,125
<i>Are you there, Dr. House?
It's on, bring it on, on</i>

1030
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:11,661
<i>Oh, yo, he's coming
to the stage, y'all</i>

1031
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:16,404
<i>It's Dr. House on the remix
Dr. House on the remix</i>

1032
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:18,946
<i>Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo</i>

1033
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,847
<i>They say to take their pills
They say don't be a creep</i>

1034
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:24,181
<i>But how can I get better...</i>

1035
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:28,022
<i>If I can't get no sleep</i>

1036
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:32,151
<i>You gotta think before you act
in order to progress</i>

1037
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:37,657
<i>If you don't make connections
then your whole life is a mess</i>

1038
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:42,432
<i>Yeah, so tell me, Doctor
what I really gotta know</i>

1039
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,506
<i>How do I get better?</i>

1040
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,075
<i>Just do a talent show!</i>

1041
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:51,638
<i>Oh, well, I guess I'm just a
mess, yes! Preach it to me, brother</i>

1042
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:52,975
<i>A life of restlessness</i>

1043
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:54,845
<i>But at least
we have each other!</i>

1044
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:57,078
<i>We got each other!
We got each other!</i>

1045
01:15:57,152 --> 01:15:58,779
<i>Like two brothers
from another mother</i>

1046
01:15:58,854 --> 01:16:01,482
<i>Duck and run for cover
Ward Six</i>

1047
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:13,466
How are you doing?
You hanging in there?

1048
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:16,197
Usually, I open with that.

1049
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:20,934
Thanks for staying.

1050
01:16:23,145 --> 01:16:25,875
So, what do you
want to talk about?

1051
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,247
Things are actually...

1052
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:32,648
Actually good.

1053
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,916
You're not just saying that
because you don't want to complain

1054
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:37,857
in front of the guy
who just lost his father?

1055
01:16:37,926 --> 01:16:39,325
I'm not that cured.

1056
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,621
I still got stuff to do,

1057
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:46,500
but I'm good.

1058
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,975
I'm sorry.

1059
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:13,258
I was trying
to prove a point.

1060
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,462
I was trying to be right.

1061
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:22,096
I ended up putting you
in a dangerous situation,

1062
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:24,661
and I was not equipped
to handle it.

1063
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:27,971
And you got hurt,
and it's my fault.

1064
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,637
And I'm sorry.

1065
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,421
Med time.

1066
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:52,161
I'm going to try one of
those pink ones today. You?

1067
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,212
Thank you.

1068
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:49,217
You're welcome.

1069
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:00,458
Got a surprise.

1070
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:19,642
Today we're here
to congratulate Annie.

1071
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:25,717
We are proud of her, we
wish her well, and we hope to

1072
01:20:25,787 --> 01:20:28,779
never see her again.
Never see her again.

1073
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,433
If you go silent
for over a decade,

1074
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:46,770
you don't just get to slide
right back into society.

1075
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:52,971
She's going to a rehab
facility first. In Arizona.

1076
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:58,076
Her family's moving there.

1077
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:03,946
I'm sorry, House.
I just found out myself.

1078
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:11,262
I want an overnight pass.

1079
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:17,931
I can help you with this.

1080
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:19,405
I've earned it.
You have, but...

1081
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:22,807
Isn't extending trust part of the
whole "getting me better" thing?

1082
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,176
If you insist on a pass,
I'll give it to you.

1083
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:28,978
But I know where you're going and I
know you haven't thought it through.

1084
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:32,581
We need to sit down
and talk about this.

1085
01:21:34,256 --> 01:21:36,315
Please give me the pass.

1086
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:05,113
Hi.

1087
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:07,086
Hello. Who are you?

1088
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:08,554
I'm...

1089
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:12,283
Ben, go inside, okay?

1090
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,201
You didn't say anything.

1091
01:22:20,702 --> 01:22:24,900
And now Annie's leaving, and
I hear you're going to Arizona.

1092
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:28,742
My husband travels
to Phoenix a lot,

1093
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:31,176
his corporate
headquarters are there.

1094
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:32,770
We've been wanting
to move for years,

1095
01:22:32,847 --> 01:22:35,338
but we've been
tethered here.

1096
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:36,907
Now we're not.

1097
01:22:39,387 --> 01:22:41,252
I don't want you to go.

1098
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:44,756
I don't want to go.

1099
01:22:47,128 --> 01:22:49,926
But I can't break up
my family.

1100
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,795
I can't leave my children.

1101
01:22:54,069 --> 01:22:56,367
I just don't
want it to change.

1102
01:23:00,442 --> 01:23:03,775
I'm sorry that I didn't
come to say goodbye.

1103
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:09,480
I thought it ended
kind of perfect.

1104
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:18,752
I have to go.

1105
01:23:37,545 --> 01:23:41,572
Not the most exciting use of the
overnight pass I've ever seen.

1106
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,014
She left.

1107
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:45,917
And

1108
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:48,553
I'm lost.

1109
01:24:01,836 --> 01:24:03,861
I'm gonna
write your letter,

1110
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,402
to the medical board,

1111
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:09,238
recommending that
they give your license back.

1112
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:13,542
You can't just console me by giving
me a lollipop when I skin my knee.

1113
01:24:13,615 --> 01:24:14,843
Two things
just happened.

1114
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:17,851
You got hurt, which means
you connected to someone else

1115
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:19,546
strongly enough to miss them.

1116
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:22,784
And more important,
you recognized the pain

1117
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:27,123
and came to talk to me, instead of
hiding from it in a Vicodin bottle.

1118
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:31,021
The fact that you're
hurting and you came here,

1119
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:34,626
the fact that you're taking your
meds, and we're talking right now.

1120
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:39,568
Come inside and
get some sleep.

1121
01:24:39,641 --> 01:24:42,576
Tomorrow, you can start
saying your goodbyes.

1122
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:52,618
Today we're here
to congratulate Greg.

1123
01:24:53,655 --> 01:24:57,056
We are proud of him, we
wish him well, and we hope to

1124
01:24:57,125 --> 01:24:59,992
never see him again.
Never see him again.

1125
01:25:00,462 --> 01:25:01,759
House.

1126
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,541
Back off. People
already think we're gay.

1127
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:39,887
What do you need, Alvie?

1128
01:26:39,961 --> 01:26:41,019
My meds.

1129
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,458
I want to get better.
