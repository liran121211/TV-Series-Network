1
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,133
Hey.

2
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,336
Hey, I'll be right there.

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:13,003
Take your time.

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,708
You mind if I get
a drink of water?

5
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:17,875
No, no. Not at all,
help yourself.

6
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,597
Not exactly
beach reading, huh?

7
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:36,365
Do you understand
any of that stuff?

8
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:37,733
Well, most of these
I can get through.

9
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,705
But that one, I can't
get past the dust jacket.

10
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,332
Where's Ted?
Laid off.

11
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,808
Company's going
with per diem workers.

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:46,311
You don't have to pay
overtime, health insurance.

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,710
Wow, that sucks.

14
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:51,615
I don't mind. Really. I'm not
a 40-hour-a-week kind of guy.

15
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:56,555
Uh, if I could just
get you to sign...

16
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,090
Right. Um...

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,486
Hang on one second.
I wanna show you something.

18
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,432
You're gonna laugh,

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,129
but I swear this guy, James
Sidas, looks exactly like you.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,705
Wait, hang on a second.

21
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,505
<i>This guy is you. I saw a
profile Nova did on you.</i>

22
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,377
You're like the youngest
guy to ever graduate MIT.

23
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,041
Standards were
lower back then.

24
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:25,550
You got an IQ of 178.

25
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,848
Published three books
and 35 papers,

26
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,786
all before
the age of 18?

27
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,016
Yeah.

28
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,285
Sorry, I really
need to get going,

29
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,758
so if I could just
get you to sign off...

30
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,457
All right. I'll trade you.
I'll sign if you'll sign.

31
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:39,926
I'm not that guy
any more.

32
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,728
Come on, man. This is
the most exciting thing

33
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,429
that's happened
in this place in years.

34
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,536
Come on,
don't be like that.

35
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,445
I'm paying you
a compliment.

36
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,348
It's not that. I'm...

37
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,950
My hand's not working.

38
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:05,855
Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa. You okay?

39
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,652
No.

40
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,166
$2.32. Put it on Dr. Wilson's tab.

41
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,502
I don't know who Dr. Wilson
is, and we don't have tabs.

42
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:56,166
Do you know who I am?

43
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,675
No.
Good.

44
00:02:58,077 --> 00:02:59,476
But, sir...

45
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,571
I got it.
It's all right.

46
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:04,447
Thanks.

47
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,542
Although, I should make it
clear that for two bucks,

48
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,712
all you get is top half,
over the clothes.

49
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:12,115
Any plans
for turkey day?

50
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,025
Going to my sister's
for dinner. Why?

51
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,920
Just making
pleasant conversation.

52
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,964
I heard tell of
folks doing such.

53
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,296
How about we
talk about this?

54
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,302
Fifteen-year-old, recurring
migraines and blurred vision.

55
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,564
Great.
Really?

56
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,663
Sure. There's no point
putting a band together

57
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,139
if we're not
gonna play any gigs.

58
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,803
Hold on.
Take this instead.

59
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,675
I was expecting
more resistance.

60
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:37,614
That was the old me. New me is
static guarded and friction free.

61
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,515
Enjoy your drumstick.

62
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,715
Ready to
save some lives?

63
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,353
Thirty-two-year-old courier,
ataxia, anemia, mild cough.

64
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,126
CT was clear,
tox screen negative.

65
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,996
What are you
so excited about?

66
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,002
Why wouldn't I be?
Got all my starters back,

67
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:01,131
plus a couple of first-class free
agents. I feel like Mike Tomlin.

68
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,240
Probably not as much as you
do, but you get the idea.

69
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,040
Ataxia and anemia, could
be viral, maybe West Nile.

70
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:11,015
No fever, lymph glands were
normal. Anybody seen Wilson?

71
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,244
Hyperbilirubinemia?

72
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,377
Yeah, like that's
a real thing.

73
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,478
Meningitis.

74
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,022
Anemia's a stretch.

75
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,388
Page Dr. James Wilson
at 558.

76
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,824
What about
sickle cell?

77
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,360
The guy's white.
Whites can get it.

78
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,056
Come on. We get the tennis
elbow and all the money,

79
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,257
let them have
sickle cell.

80
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,594
TTP is a better fit.

81
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,895
He's right.

82
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:35,903
What, you thought I wouldn't
agree with him? Ever?

83
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:37,067
Well, you didn't
agree with him.

84
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:39,771
That's why he dumped you.
Oh, sorry, it was mutual.

85
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,076
We're cool, okay? Nobody's
angry, nobody's hurt.

86
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,581
Sounds passionate.

87
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,016
TTP makes sense to me.
Not to me.

88
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,074
What if he had
a history of...

89
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,088
One big happy family.
TTP it is.

90
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,686
Confirm with a blood smear
and ADAMTS13 antibodies.

91
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,695
<i>Dr. James Wilson,
please dial 558.</i>

92
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,554
Can you cure it?

93
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,098
TTP isn't
completely curable,

94
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,532
but the symptoms are manageable
with the proper treatment.

95
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:03,762
Is this the treatment?

96
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,100
No. First we need to do a blood
test to confirm the diagnosis.

97
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,298
But he's gonna
get better?

98
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:08,738
Honey,
that's what she's saying.

99
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,968
I'm gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

100
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,170
How can't I worry?
You're in the hospital.

101
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:13,769
I'm gonna be fine.

102
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:16,144
Are you sure everything
was fine before?

103
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,705
I mean, given your
educational background,

104
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:20,082
you'd think you could at least
find a job with a medical plan.

105
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,643
We have money.
Don't worry.

106
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:22,779
It's not that.

107
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,447
It's just I want
to make sure

108
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,253
we have all
the information we should.

109
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,588
My husband wouldn't lie.

110
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,651
It's okay, baby.
He's just doing his job.

111
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:34,098
He just wants to make sure I'm not
a secret drug addict or an alcoholic.

112
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,965
Or hiding a history
of mental illness.

113
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,334
I work as a courier
because I want to.

114
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,635
It's easy.
I don't have to think.

115
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:43,869
It's too hard to think?

116
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,934
No. Just unpleasant.

117
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,910
No matter what I did, it
really wasn't good enough.

118
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,108
Then I met Dara.

119
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,412
She didn't care
how smart I was,

120
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,976
or what I might accomplish
in the future.

121
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:58,455
It was the first time in my
life that I was really happy.

122
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:02,085
So I decided I would
rather be happy than smart.

123
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,231
You all right?

124
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,044
Sorry. I know you're
not okay. I mean...

125
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,510
She left.

126
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,945
Went back to Chicago.

127
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:26,382
Any chance of
reconciliation?

128
00:06:26,652 --> 00:06:27,778
No.

129
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,786
You sure you don't wanna
grab a drink after work?

130
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,984
I figured we could talk about
the perils of dating doctors.

131
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,458
I wasn't dating Cameron.

132
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,551
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

133
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:38,688
I know what you're doing,
and I appreciate it.

134
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,960
But I've got it
under control.

135
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,058
That's what you said
about the Dibala incident,

136
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,967
and obviously you didn't.

137
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:48,564
And talking about it obviously
made things so much better.

138
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,006
Didn't you think there was
something weird about that guy?

139
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,517
Not really. In fact,
he seemed pretty normal.

140
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,212
That's my point.

141
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,948
Guys with IQs
off the chart

142
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,718
are usually
completely abnormal.

143
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,923
Speaking of House,
why did you come back?

144
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,485
I mean, you must have
taken a major pay cut.

145
00:07:10,563 --> 00:07:11,996
Life's too short
to worry about money.

146
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,224
Your wife feel
the same way?

147
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,200
She's happy to cut back
on some things.

148
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,702
Like sex.

149
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,232
Why'd you come back?
Why wouldn't I?

150
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,799
Like Foreman said, nobody's
angry, nobody's hurt.

151
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:25,969
Schistocytes.

152
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,577
That means TTP.

153
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,843
Which is what we thought it'd be,
remember? This is a good thing.

154
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,011
This is an easy thing, and House
doesn't take cases that are easy,

155
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,712
which means
it's not TTP.

156
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:39,155
And he wants to see how long
it takes us to catch up to him.

157
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,293
Schistocytes
suggest TTP.

158
00:07:44,363 --> 00:07:46,092
Good, now what?

159
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,059
Normally we'd try
plasmapheresis,

160
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,295
but the patient has an
albumin colloid allergy.

161
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,427
So?

162
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,597
So that means we have to
give him a splenectomy.

163
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,265
Yes, it does.

164
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,213
Wilson?
No.

165
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,450
Do you know
where he is?

166
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,617
Not in here.

167
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,593
You're sure you want us
to take out his spleen?

168
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,855
Is that what
a splenectomy is?

169
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,090
I thought it was an
ice cream treat. Yuck.

170
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,928
So you do really
think he has TTP.

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,126
You're not
just testing us.

172
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,726
Yeah. Like I have
time for games.

173
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,306
So, why did you
really take this case?

174
00:08:28,374 --> 00:08:31,605
Isn't it obvious? I'm
fishing for a dinner invite.

175
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,050
Missed you
at breakfast this morning.

176
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,722
And lunch.

177
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,418
I had
a dentist appointment.

178
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,654
You know where
Cuddy's sister lives?

179
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,096
You see, this is why I don't
answer your urgent pages,

180
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,962
because they're
not urgent pages.

181
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,969
I've decided what I'm gonna
do about Cuddy and Lucas.

182
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,436
I'm going to
break them up.

183
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,031
Of course. It's given
me a purpose in life,

184
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,439
a goal,
a raison d'être.

185
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,412
Albeit a selfish,
mean-spirited, childish raison.

186
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,041
I think of it
more as benevolent.

187
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,783
There's only two possible
outcomes for their relationship,

188
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,048
they split or they
stay together forever.

189
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,750
If it's split, then the sooner it
happens, the better for everyone.

190
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,088
If it's stay, then my
meddling won't matter.

191
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:24,058
In fact,
if they survive it,

192
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,325
it might even make
their bond stronger.

193
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,959
How you manage to
elevate your narcissism

194
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,868
to beneficence
is masterful.

195
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,833
And I've decided to do it
at Thanksgiving dinner,

196
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,671
just 'cause
I'm sentimental.

197
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,836
Dinner's at Cuddy's sister's,
which brings us back to...

198
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,607
House, don't.

199
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,980
I fished for an invite. Cuddy
wasn't biting, so I'll have to crash.

200
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,986
I have no idea where
Cuddy's sister lives.

201
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,249
Ask and thou
shalt receive.

202
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,348
You can't honestly think
I would help you with this.

203
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,122
Not help me,
help Cuddy, remember?

204
00:09:56,462 --> 00:10:00,091
If you don't get it, I'll be forced
to use more nefarious methods.

205
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,690
Happy holidays.

206
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:06,862
Ah.

207
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,338
Looks great.

208
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,398
So, he's all better?

209
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,239
Probably be on
some long-term meds,

210
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,040
and he's about
10 ounces lighter,

211
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,105
other than that, he
won't even know it's gone.

212
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,712
Did you hear that, honey?
You're gonna be just fine.

213
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,516
When can I get out
of here?

214
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,955
If everything checks out,
less than a week.

215
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:29,586
Good. 'Cause those boxes
aren't gonna deliver colors.

216
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,954
Colors?

217
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,591
Green and orange

218
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,125
and ceiling.

219
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,468
Mr. Sidas, do you know
where you are? Chewing.

220
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:41,697
Jimmy?

221
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:42,763
Shirt.

222
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,675
He's stroking.
Call the cath lab, now!

223
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:46,973
Oh, my God.

224
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,919
Blood flow's restored, appears
to be no permanent damage.

225
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,250
Good news is it turns
out to be an exciting,

226
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,552
action-packed thrill ride
of a case after all.

227
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,388
Bad news is we took out
his spleen for nothing.

228
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,894
Thank God he's still got
his appendix and tonsils.

229
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:07,626
So what looks like TTP,
acts like TTP,

230
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,225
Tests like TTP,
but isn't TTP?

231
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,770
CNS Vasculitis,
explains the ataxia

232
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,135
and anemia,
maybe the stroke.

233
00:11:14,206 --> 00:11:15,696
CT would have
picked up something.

234
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,972
Hi, I'm Greg House. I'm a
friend of your sister, Lisa.

235
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,535
Could be DIC.

236
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,944
Lisa Cuddy.

237
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,606
Sorry, wrong number. You gonna ask?

238
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,651
I'm sure he's got a
perfectly logical explanation.

239
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:27,811
Can't be DIC,
no hemorrhaging.

240
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,515
And I'm calling all 12 Julia
Cuddys within 100-mile radius.

241
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,956
See? Completely reasonable.
Acquired pancytopenia?

242
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,085
WBC's normal.

243
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:40,462
Hey, Julia. You're
Lisa's sister, right?

244
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,399
Are you sure?
You are number 12.

245
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,767
Maybe she got married
and changed her name.

246
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,237
Otis Campbell.

247
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,637
Probably kept
her first name.

248
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,834
The mnemonic for toxins.

249
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,639
"O" for organophosphates, "T"
for tricyclics, "I" for insulin...

250
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,237
Or as I remember it,
"Moist Place. "

251
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,748
That's "Place" spelled with
two "L"s and a silent "B."

252
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:59,114
Except the tox screen
was negative.

253
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,585
Standard tox screen. Unstandard
toxins don't show up on it.

254
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:05,090
Well, you two do an unstandard tox
screen. You two search his home.

255
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,819
Otis Campbell's gotta
be hiding somewhere.

256
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,128
Smartest guy
in the world

257
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:11,959
and this is
the best he can do?

258
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:13,623
Maybe he's doing
what he loves.

259
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:16,224
Delivering boxes
was a childhood dream.

260
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,435
Soda, processed cheese,
marshmallow spread.

261
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,097
Nothing in here is
capable of going bad.

262
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:24,870
Ibuprofen, eye drops,
cough syrup.

263
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,942
You want to come over
for Thanksgiving dinner?

264
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,709
You never asked me
over before, why now?

265
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:36,448
Just never thought of it. But
now that we're both on the team...

266
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:38,513
And my wife left me?

267
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:42,053
Is that a bad reason?

268
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,426
No, but I'm okay.

269
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,563
On both the food
and friends.

270
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,123
Mice.

271
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:52,659
Leptospirosis could explain
the ataxia and the anemia.

272
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:54,865
But not
without a fever.

273
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,135
You have someone
to talk to?

274
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,642
Yeah.
Who?

275
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,137
What, you want names?

276
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:04,842
Look, you lost a friend,
I get it.

277
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,043
But I'm not Kutner.

278
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,610
Good. 'Cause Kutner never
used to come over for dinner.

279
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,984
I'm going to pretend there's
something interesting over here,

280
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,718
so you'll shut up.

281
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:30,470
Actually, there is. He's got
sketches of atomic structure.

282
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,010
This one is full
of math proofs.

283
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,843
They're all old.
Nothing since '96.

284
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,508
This isn't some
homework assignment

285
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:40,848
his parents
forced on him,

286
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,651
this is passion. Why would
he want to stop doing this?

287
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,089
Marriage destroyed
his soul?

288
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:00,497
Ooh.

289
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,833
Or maybe it was
just the booze.

290
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,641
Thank you, Doctor.
You've been wonderful.

291
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,547
As have you, Diana.
Be well.

292
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,051
Thank you.

293
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,952
You're helping.
Voluntarily.

294
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,289
He's done six already.

295
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,985
I figured you might
be getting backed up

296
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,391
with the holiday season
and all.

297
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:25,988
So which one of us slipped through the
wormhole into an alternate dimension?

298
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,057
I have always loved
to travel. And paint.

299
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,192
Lucky number seven.

300
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,635
House, I know you're trying to be nice.

301
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,799
But I also know you're doing
it because you have an agenda.

302
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,173
Wow. Sexy and smart.

303
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:40,505
Lucas is a lucky guy.

304
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:44,640
The question is, is this
a bad agenda or a good one?

305
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:47,747
Either you're trying
to screw with me,

306
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,415
or you're trying to show me
that you've really changed.

307
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,990
So which is it?
I'm dying to know.

308
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,438
What are you doing
for Thanksgiving dinner?

309
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,936
Peace in our time!

310
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,940
Only cost me 45 minutes
of clinic duty.

311
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,944
This is a three-hour drive.

312
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,781
Have you considered the possibility
that this is a fake address?

313
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,981
You think she'd send me to a
vacant lot for Thanksgiving dinner?

314
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,024
If she's smart.
She is.

315
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:29,060
That's why I ran it through
Motor Vehicles. Good as gold.

316
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,688
This cannot end well.

317
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:35,427
Don't want it to end well.
You should come as my date.

318
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:38,396
You're not gonna want
to miss this.

319
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,340
The unstandard
tox screen

320
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,001
was as clean
as the standard one.

321
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:48,046
But we found vodka
stashed away in his place.

322
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,678
What's with the ties?

323
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:56,013
Makes me look adorably
non-threatening. Party or party-hearty?

324
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,488
Liver failure would
explain all the symptoms.

325
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,223
Party.

326
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:09,032
So, the guy's a brainiac and his
secret drug of choice is booze?

327
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,001
It's kind of pedestrian,
don't you think?

328
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:12,662
Talk to him,
he's a pedestrian guy.

329
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,333
With pedestrian alcoholism. Liver
biopsy can wait until after Thanksgiving.

330
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,103
Yes, assuming the biopsy

331
00:16:18,177 --> 00:16:20,236
is going to tell us exactly
what we expect it to tell us,

332
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,870
it can wait till
after New Years.

333
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:25,508
On the other hand, Taub and Thirteen
can do the liver biopsy today.

334
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:26,710
Why us?

335
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,946
Juniority.
Welcome back.

336
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,946
What do you
want us to do?

337
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,254
Same as me.
Have a happy Thanksgiving.

338
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,258
I'm not an alcoholic.

339
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,197
Yes, you just hide vodka
around the house for fun.

340
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,496
I drink,
just not a lot.

341
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,434
Since when do you
drink at all?

342
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,871
I have one shot when I get
home from work, baby. That's it.

343
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,374
So why lie to
your wife about it?

344
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,137
Because
it's not important.

345
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,269
What difference
does it make?

346
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,609
That you drink every day,
by yourself?

347
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,275
I have one lousy drink,
okay?

348
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,544
Have you ever
seen me drunk? Ever?

349
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:02,553
No, but you've obviously been
drinking enough to hurt your liver.

350
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,589
My liver is fine.
Hold still.

351
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,918
There we go.

352
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:11,792
This test is
a waste of time.

353
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,639
Hey.
This wine?

354
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,651
All right. Very good.
There, we got this...

355
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:41,314
String beans?

356
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,337
Julia?

357
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,849
No, I'm the house sitter.

358
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,716
They're in Hawaii
for the week.

359
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,684
Happy Thanksgiving.

360
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,424
Happy Thanksgiving,
you guys.

361
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:20,487
Happy Thanksgiving.

362
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,658
Cheers. Cheers.

363
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,967
You must be Dr. House.

364
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:26,869
I was told I should offer
you a turkey sandwich.

365
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,081
Tuna salad. Closest
thing they had to turkey.

366
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,181
Thanks. But I'm hoping I
can still get out of here

367
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,158
and catch the tail end
of dinner with my wife.

368
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,216
Anything?

369
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,387
No cirrhosis, no scarring,
no infection.

370
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,227
Blood panel?
Elevated albumin, 7.2.

371
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,201
That's it?
Everything else is fine.

372
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,431
So it was
a waste of time.

373
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:03,597
Unless,
it's not his liver

374
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:06,610
that's elevating his
albumin, it's his kidneys.

375
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,407
Renal failure.
Explains the anemia.

376
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,879
If he developed
hyperkalemia,

377
00:19:09,948 --> 00:19:12,781
that would explain the
ataxia, but the stroke...

378
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,614
Ischemic encephalopathy.

379
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,046
Nice.

380
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,916
Except now we have to stay
and test his kidneys.

381
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,137
Key under the mat.

382
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,265
There's no key
under the mat.

383
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,535
Oh, right.

384
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,605
You need to replace one
of your kitchen windows.

385
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,741
I helped myself to
your wine cellar.

386
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,647
I'll leave a buck
on the way out.

387
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,048
You're not right for her.

388
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,213
And you are?

389
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,654
Less wrong.

390
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:52,712
Ah.

391
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,924
But then
I started thinking...

392
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,297
What was I saying?

393
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,768
You were saying
it's late and...

394
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:09,671
She invited me. She
didn't know if she should.

395
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:13,837
She was trying to figure out
if I really have changed

396
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:19,143
or if I'm still the same
old SOB I've always been.

397
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,653
But she always
gave me a chance.

398
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,892
Eight hundred and
thirty-two chances,

399
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,123
and I used up
every one of them.

400
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:35,633
Eight hundred and thirty-two's
her limit, make a note.

401
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,229
How about
a cup of coffee?

402
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:43,004
It's just instant, but...

403
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,073
I'm pathetic.

404
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,683
I don't deserve her.

405
00:20:56,955 --> 00:21:00,049
Okay. Okay.
All right.

406
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,923
Here.

407
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,629
Maybe you should
crash here.

408
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,595
It's a sofa bed.

409
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,727
I love her.

410
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,038
Patient's liver is fine, it's
his kidneys that are shot.

411
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,479
And where the hell
is House?

412
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,039
He left a message on the
machine. He's not coming in today.

413
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,608
So what causes
kidney failure?

414
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,710
Rhabdomyolysis.

415
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,015
No edema.

416
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,181
I trust you had
a wonderful Thanksgiving.

417
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:35,283
I don't remember.
So I guess I did.

418
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,859
Multiple myeloma.
No bone pain.

419
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,328
You got drunk alone?

420
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,990
No. That would
be a sign

421
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,091
that I need to talk
to you about this.

422
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,567
Polycystic kidney disease.

423
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,126
No UTIs or flank pain.

424
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,941
Well, what if his cough
is more than just a cold?

425
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,102
He hasn't been coughing.
It's in his history,

426
00:21:53,178 --> 00:21:55,408
and we found a new bottle of cough
syrup in his medicine cabinet.

427
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,004
Cough could mean
Goodpasture Syndrome,

428
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,674
affects kidneys
and lungs.

429
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,911
Start him on
immunosuppressors and dialysis.

430
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,578
We'll do it right after
we run it by House.

431
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,019
He's not
answering his pager.

432
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,454
Looks like he's
leaving it up to us.

433
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,889
Us. Not you.

434
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,789
And since
we don't disagree,

435
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,192
you can save your fight
for another case.

436
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,093
How long do I have
to be hooked up for?

437
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,764
Four to six
hours a day

438
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,865
until we see an improvement.
What if you don't?

439
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,773
Then we keep doing it
until he gets a transplant.

440
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,436
You were sure
it was his spleen,

441
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,309
and then you were sure
it was his liver,

442
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:30,780
which he told you
it wasn't,

443
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:32,180
and now you're sure
it's his kidneys.

444
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,615
It's
definitely his kidneys.

445
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,347
We just don't know
why it's his kidneys.

446
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,823
Any word
from Cameron?

447
00:22:43,061 --> 00:22:44,221
Nope.

448
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,800
I started seeing a
counselor after my diagnosis.

449
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,061
She's really good.

450
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,766
Why does everyone assume that
everyone works in the exact same way?

451
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,102
We pretty much do.

452
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:59,632
Our egos want us to think we're
all snowflakes, no two alike,

453
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,474
but really, we all want
the same things,

454
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:05,209
love, forgiveness,
chocolate.

455
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,449
Well, what I want is for
everyone to leave me alone.

456
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,884
How do I get that?

457
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,125
What did you say
to Lucas last night?

458
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:26,797
I know there were
a lot of consonants.

459
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,398
I don't remember how I got
here, never mind what I said.

460
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:32,670
Well, I just
talked to him.

461
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,075
And he said he thought
it'd be better

462
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,580
if we stopped
seeing each other.

463
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,376
Said he didn't
realize how much

464
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,975
there still was
between you and me.

465
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:44,385
And he didn't want to get
caught in the middle of us.

466
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,660
I was drunk.

467
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,122
Whatever I said,
he can't really...

468
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,664
I've had enough, House.

469
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:56,826
I actually felt bad
about scamming you,

470
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,098
but then you lived down to my
expectations, and then some.

471
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,773
There is no us.

472
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,813
There never will be.

473
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,124
It worked.

474
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:24,561
Please tell me you're talking
about a medical procedure.

475
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,358
They split up
this morning.

476
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,524
You're the very first
one I've told.

477
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,593
And you think she'll start dating
you? I'm sure she hates you.

478
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,602
But her eyes say,

479
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:37,198
"How will I ever pay you
for that tennis lesson?"

480
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:38,936
What a shame.

481
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,272
They'll get over it.

482
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:44,212
I meant for you. I'll get
over it faster than they do.

483
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,817
I can't believe
that Lucas fell for my

484
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:49,751
"I'd never say this
because it's so personal

485
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,221
"except that I'm drunk"
profession of love.

486
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,848
Second oldest trick
in the book.

487
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:57,292
You're right. It's his
fault because he's stupid.

488
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,461
He certainly is.

489
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,668
You're stupid.

490
00:25:14,312 --> 00:25:17,338
Well, I'm rubber
and you're glue...

491
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,474
He's not pedestrian,
he's stupid.

492
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,682
Or at least stupider than he
should be. He's a DXM junkie.

493
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,424
Dextromethorphan.
As in cough syrup?

494
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,391
He wasn't taking it
for his cough.

495
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,258
It's cheap, available
at your corner drugstore,

496
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,492
and taken in high doses,
it's a dumb drug.

497
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:38,065
Dumb drug?
He obviously hasn't...

498
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,728
He's smart
compared to you,

499
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,364
he's a moron compared
to what he was.

500
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,607
Robotripping lowers the IQ,
it also causes brain damage.

501
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,842
Unless taken with the
proper amount of ethanol,

502
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,383
about one drink per day.

503
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,450
He wasn't
abusing the booze

504
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,249
and taking the cough
remedy medicinally,

505
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:01,190
he was abusing the cough meds
and taking the booze medicinally.

506
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,058
Bravo.

507
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,424
Why would you do that?

508
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:09,831
If you had a gift, why
would you just throw it away?

509
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,530
I didn't throw it away. I
just turned it down a little.

510
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:18,475
When my brain was on low, everything
didn't seem so miserable any more.

511
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,306
Life was bearable.

512
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:23,307
I thought that
I did that.

513
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,144
You do.

514
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:29,481
Long-term abuse of DXM
explains all your symptoms.

515
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:33,183
Even, oh, sweet irony,
your cough.

516
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,783
Whole bowel lavage,
activated charcoal.

517
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,851
We get all traces of it
out of your system,

518
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,762
you'll be the unhappiest
little courier in no time.

519
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:44,695
I don't think
I can live without it.

520
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,301
You'd be surprised
what you can live without.

521
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,001
Make him a genius.

522
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:58,744
I can't believe it. He
looks so much better already.

523
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,453
<i>We were thinking
about calling GQ.</i>

524
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,489
Lavage has removed all
traces of DXM from his body.

525
00:27:06,658 --> 00:27:08,558
You're drawing again.
What is it?

526
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,651
Just doodles.

527
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,856
No, it's not. Come on,
Jimmy, I want to know.

528
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,433
This is a toroidal
helicon plasma device.

529
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:24,736
It determines
the amount of energy

530
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,903
expended by
the subatomic particles.

531
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:33,914
I'm thirsty. Could you get
me a juice or something?

532
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:36,046
Yeah. Of course.

533
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,651
I'm so happy, Jimmy.

534
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:46,553
I told you.

535
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:51,493
You know what the difference
between her IQ and mine is?

536
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,729
91 points.

537
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:56,365
In relation, she's closer to
a gibbon than she is to me.

538
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,877
Having sex with her would
be an act of bestiality.

539
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,141
I assume
you didn't marry her

540
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,680
for her skill in
Applied Physics.

541
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,046
I just wish
she could spell it.

542
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,309
You really think
you'd be happier

543
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,876
with someone who
could spell better?

544
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,285
No.

545
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,487
That's the problem.
I'm the one who's a jerk.

546
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,088
But I owe her everything.

547
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,229
I want to want
to be with her.

548
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,495
And when I'm clear, I...

549
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,669
I can't.

550
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,609
Fainting, dizziness,
shortness of breath?

551
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,942
Sometimes.

552
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,545
Is the wait
always this long?

553
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:43,075
Only on days that end in
"day. " Diarrhea, weight loss?

554
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:44,348
A bit.

555
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,048
Don't you ever shave?

556
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,286
Yeah, once a week.
How about you?

557
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:51,952
Stomach pain, tenderness?

558
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,555
Every now and then. Are you
this rude to all your patients?

559
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:56,725
Oh, yes, don't think
you're special.

560
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:00,897
So we got a lot of vague,
unverifiable symptoms,

561
00:29:00,972 --> 00:29:03,805
yet all the physical signs
are perfectly normal.

562
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,638
What do you think I have? I'm not sure,

563
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,077
but I think
it's a lame job.

564
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,273
What?

565
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,774
You're a rat. Insurance
company sends you out

566
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,819
to check on the quality
of medical care.

567
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:15,978
That's ridiculous.

568
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:17,078
Is it really?

569
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,520
'Cause you seem
a lot more interested

570
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,217
in asking questions
than answering them.

571
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,418
Handwriting in your medical
records is obviously not a doctor's,

572
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:23,756
'cause I can
almost read it.

573
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,661
And when you went out for a urine
sample, I looked in your purse.

574
00:29:26,731 --> 00:29:28,562
Found the list of questions
you were supposed to memorize

575
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:32,330
before you came to the
clinic. I was looking for gum.

576
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:33,929
You're an ass.

577
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:35,063
Put it in your report.

578
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,903
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you 20 bucks

579
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,306
if you'll pretend
that I'm not

580
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:39,843
when we leave this room.

581
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,606
Remember,
first ice, then heat.

582
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:47,776
If you have any problems,
don't hesitate to call me.

583
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:49,649
Thank you,
Dr. House.

584
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,350
Wait a second.
Where's Cuddy?

585
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:56,256
Gone for the day.

586
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,053
Hey! Hey! Hey!

587
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:04,427
Sorry, can't remember if I've mocked
you yet for being a male nurse.

588
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,501
I think this counts.

589
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:08,569
Fair enough.

590
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:14,138
That isn't
the man I married.

591
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:18,948
Yes, he is. He's just
smarter. Give him some time.

592
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,507
I'm sure...
He hates me.

593
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:23,349
His body is going through
withdrawal. He's adjusting.

594
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,322
Maybe he never loved me.
Not really.

595
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:29,451
Maybe we never really
had anything at all.

596
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,927
Somebody help!

597
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:40,770
I can't feel my legs.
I can't feel my legs.

598
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,967
Anywhere. Nothing.

599
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,710
We have to talk
about this.

600
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:56,246
It's late. I'm tired.

601
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,123
I know it's
a big pay cut,

602
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,886
but I'll always have
the chance to make money.

603
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,520
I won't always have the
chance to do this job.

604
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,759
That's what you think?
That it's about the money?

605
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,168
So it's that I didn't consult
you before I took the job?

606
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,796
That was offensive, but
it's not about that either.

607
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,339
So then...

608
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,809
Can you give me
the first letter?

609
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,177
When we got married,

610
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,185
you were an intern working
30-hour shifts, doing grunt work,

611
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:29,720
and we both put up
with it because we knew

612
00:31:29,787 --> 00:31:31,448
that it was leading
to something better.

613
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:35,686
In your private practice, you
are the boss. You call the shots.

614
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,352
But now,
you're 40 years old,

615
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:39,487
you're still
doing grunt work.

616
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,966
That's what this is about?
You think I'm a wuss?

617
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,563
He made you miss
Thanksgiving dinner.

618
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:00,540
Vitamin B12 deficiency
gives us anemia, numbness...

619
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:01,607
Not a stroke.

620
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,675
If he has
a vascular malformation...

621
00:32:02,787 --> 00:32:04,687
Anemia's not macrocytic.

622
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,486
Sorry to
inconvenience you.

623
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,220
Dying patients can
be so thoughtless.

624
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:11,455
Don't.

625
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,931
Great comeback. Is that
Oscar Wilde? Come on, people.

626
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,125
Bone marrow malignancy.

627
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,394
Wouldn't produce
schistocytes.

628
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,368
Lupus. Gee, thanks for coming in.

629
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,927
ANA was negative.

630
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:22,930
What about you?

631
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,669
You got any predictable
drivel you'd like to add?

632
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,233
I think they've given
you enough already.

633
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,974
At least they're trying, not
just sitting there like roadkill.

634
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,743
Give me something!

635
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,751
Give me something or I'll
get your ex-smarter half

636
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,616
on the phone and ask her.

637
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,916
House...

638
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,524
You're going to be
pressing charges?

639
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:16,651
Against the ottoman
I tripped over?

640
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,252
Against Chase.

641
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,855
I'm pretty sure the
ottoman was acting alone.

642
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,033
You free for dinner
this weekend?

643
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,832
At least three other
people saw him do it.

644
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:28,633
Mass hysteria.
Either night?

645
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:30,867
I can't have doctors
punching each other out.

646
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,206
Oh, my God,
who got punched?

647
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,438
And more importantly,
for Chase's sake,

648
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,138
I need to know if he's
able to handle himself

649
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,308
or if I should be
getting him some help.

650
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,976
Chase couldn't
have punched anyone.

651
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,781
He was with me when I
tripped over the ottoman.

652
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:46,449
If you're not planning on eating
this weekend, maybe a movie?

653
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:48,855
I'm not doing this,
House.

654
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:50,791
It's not fun any more.

655
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:53,291
Just do your job.

656
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,071
I need your help.

657
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:10,974
What happened
to your face?

658
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:14,251
I was mowing the lawn
when the phone rang.

659
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,879
You're a computer. I'm gonna
feed you data, and you analyze it.

660
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:18,979
What are you
gonna feed me,

661
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,854
20 years of
medical knowledge, too?

662
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,189
It's not gonna work.

663
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:27,723
I know. But I don't
have anyone else to ask.

664
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,669
It's lonely, isn't it?

665
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:36,569
It's not that bad.

666
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,303
Then you're not
that smart.

667
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,671
You ever try
to kill yourself?

668
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:43,907
Not quickly.

669
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,005
I did.

670
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,779
Twelve years ago, I jumped off
the top of my eight-story building

671
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:50,753
into a dumpster bin
the day before pick-up.

672
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:55,782
I broke my collar bone,
my leg and three ribs.

673
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,686
When I was in the hospital,
they put me on narcotics

674
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,698
and suddenly
everything was just better.

675
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:06,125
I didn't feel
isolated or lonely.

676
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:08,895
That's where
I met my wife.

677
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:13,933
She was so happy
and dumb.

678
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,608
And I was

679
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,052
smart and miserable.

680
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,312
You tell me who
the genius is.

681
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,848
I fell in love with her
buzzed out of my head

682
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:33,260
and I knew I wanted to
stay that way forever.

683
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,799
Enjoy.

684
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:47,644
Easier on your conscience
if I die an idiot?

685
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,411
What's a conscience?

686
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:05,591
Which ribs did you break in
the fall? Down the left side?

687
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,996
Yeah, bottom three.
But that was 12 years ago.

688
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,334
This probably cost me my
marriage, so it better be awesome.

689
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:18,875
Ferrous oxide
contrast?

690
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:22,003
It gets absorbed
by the spleen,

691
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,637
unless he doesn't
have one,

692
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:26,706
in which case it's absorbed
by the liver and fries that.

693
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:27,876
You're killing him?

694
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,943
You think I opened him up and
didn't take out his spleen?

695
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,513
All organs do look kind of
the same, red and squishy.

696
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:40,828
Oh, my God.

697
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,627
Accessory spleens.

698
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,930
Okay, that is amazing.

699
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:47,835
Twelve years, eight
stories and a dumpster ago,

700
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,203
he broke three ribs,
damaged his spleen.

701
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:52,902
Bits of it split off, circulated
through his blood stream

702
00:36:52,977 --> 00:36:55,036
until they landed and
attached somewhere else.

703
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:58,081
So, it is TTP.

704
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:02,313
I just didn't remove
all of his spleens.

705
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:05,446
Sixteen splenectomies,

706
00:37:05,523 --> 00:37:07,991
pretty sure he gets a set
of steak knives with that.

707
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,632
I can outrun you.

708
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:29,012
Sorry about the nose. And
the eye. And the eyebrow.

709
00:37:31,148 --> 00:37:32,240
Guess I deserved it.

710
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:35,114
Well, if I thought that,
I wouldn't be apologizing.

711
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:37,518
Your fist slipped?

712
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,853
Everybody kept bugging me,
asking if I was okay.

713
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:45,459
So you bust my nose to
keep people off your back?

714
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,092
Pretty much.

715
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,964
Making people even more
worried about you.

716
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:55,528
Maybe. But at least they're
not talking to me about it.

717
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,402
Fair enough.

718
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,774
Cheers.

719
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:10,577
Thank you.

720
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:11,917
Don't be so grateful.

721
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:15,516
You'll be delivering packages
for 70 years to pay for it.

722
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,126
Well, thanks for our talk.

723
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:22,324
It's been a while since I had
a stimulating conversation.

724
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,458
So what are you
going to do?

725
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,161
Go back to my life.

726
00:38:25,236 --> 00:38:26,464
Which one?

727
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,038
The one that
has my wife in it.

728
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,732
Robotripping.

729
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,572
How does she feel
about that?

730
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,172
Well, she doesn't have to
know. It's worked for 12 years.

731
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,686
Tell your brain
I said goodbye.

732
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,893
Einstein's giving
himself a lobotomy,

733
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,731
and you're cool
with that?

734
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,768
Ignorance is bliss.

735
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,039
Hold that pose.

736
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:18,210
I'll start with t
- shirts and mugs and see how it goes.

737
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,954
Home early.

738
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,469
What happened to him?

739
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,906
You beat up House?

740
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,876
Just one right hook.

741
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:41,969
Why? What happened?

742
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,035
You were right.

743
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:46,413
I told him we need to lay down some
ground rules, it got a little heated.

744
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:50,477
That's not what I meant.
Is he okay?

745
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,351
Are you going to
be fired? Arrested?

746
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,152
Everything's fine.

747
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,321
Wow.

748
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,377
Dr. Cuddy.

749
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,911
Can we at least be civil?

750
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:27,717
How's your nose?

751
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,121
It's okay.

752
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:32,526
Does your kid
like animals?

753
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,587
I got tickets to
that holiday carnival.

754
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:37,190
I hear they have
a nice petting zoo.

755
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,935
I think I was
pretty clear before.

756
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,767
I don't mean with me.

757
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,541
Here. Take them.
Enjoy.

758
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:47,942
No, thanks.

759
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,648
They're not fake.
I didn't steal them.

760
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:56,083
One of the nurses was selling
them for her kid's scout troop.

761
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,643
I know it doesn't make
things right between us,

762
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,451
but I just wanted
to do something nice.

763
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,224
I don't want them.

764
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,360
Okay.

765
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,235
I'll see you tomorrow.

766
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,277
They didn't split up.

767
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,912
She wouldn't
take the tickets.

768
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:31,411
Of course. Windtalker code
for "we never split up. "

769
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,116
House, she told you
multiple times

770
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,748
she wants nothing
to do with you.

771
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,020
I wasn't gonna be there.

772
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:41,258
She just felt guilty that I felt
guilty, so she couldn't take them.

773
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,826
Either that or she didn't
want to appease you.

774
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,869
These weren't reparations,

775
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:50,032
just a simple gesture of
remorse, and she slapped it down.

776
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:52,941
They didn't break up.

777
00:41:53,544 --> 00:41:56,411
She just wanted me to
think that, so I'd back off.

778
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,916
Dare I ask what
you're gonna do?

779
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,582
Nothing.

780
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,720
I said they'd either break
up or they'd stay together.

781
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:09,725
They didn't break up.

782
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:13,254
And you're okay
with that?

783
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,692
It is what it is.

784
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,360
Good for you.

785
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,310
House knows I lied.

786
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,713
Why? What did he say?

787
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,416
Nothing.
I could just tell.

788
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,851
You gonna stage
another breakup?

789
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,149
No.

790
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:39,614
Oh.

791
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,284
Hi.

792
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,761
It seems like he's
going to leave us alone.

793
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,319
Mmm. Why would he do that?

794
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,990
I'm not completely sure.

795
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:53,994
So, we have his blessing?

796
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,503
I guess so.

797
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,099
I made you some
eggplant Parmesan.

798
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:04,842
And maybe House
isn't so bad after all.

799
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:09,817
That would be nice,
wouldn't it?
