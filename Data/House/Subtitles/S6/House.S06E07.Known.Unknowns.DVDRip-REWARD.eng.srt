1
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,872
Sure, let's give up now.
It's no big deal.

2
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,435
It's just Pharmacide,
just their tour kick-off.

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:17,677
I mean, who cares if we miss the
most insane party in the world?

4
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,116
Come on, Phoeb.
Victory or death.

5
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:28,222
Or possibly cake.

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,061
Look, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,165
Sorry, your caffeine fix
is on its way.

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,461
Will you hold on?

9
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,506
Hi, we're the
DJ's assistants.

10
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,978
Hold on.

11
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:56,078
No. I said we both
work for him.

12
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,922
You mean "her. "
The DJ is a she-jay.

13
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,826
It's okay, Dave,
she's my plus one.

14
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,355
Make that plus two.

15
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:18,867
You weren't worried,
were you?

16
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:19,969
Yes.

17
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,015
And there will be punishment
unless you tell us everything.

18
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,675
You've been here
all night?

19
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:28,050
After the party, we went up to the
Presidential Suite with the band.

20
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,487
It was ginormous,
like 10 rooms.

21
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,320
We had a few drinks
and some weed,

22
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,826
<i>and played Drummer God
on this giant plasma TV.</i>

23
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:36,862
Which she rocked,
by the way.

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,454
I think I hate you
right now.

25
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:42,297
Colt took me up to the roof, but by
then the gate to the pool was locked.

26
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:48,329
So no one was up there. So we
just climbed over and jumped down,

27
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,567
and went skinny dipping.

28
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,470
Did you do it?

29
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,141
No. He was so sweet.

30
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,846
Later, he played his guitar
and he wrote a song for me.

31
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,191
Oh, my God.

32
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,524
Jord, what happened
to your foot?

33
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:10,722
Maybe you twisted your
ankle when you jumped.

34
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,560
Or it could be
your allergies.

35
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,566
My aunt was allergic
to some cold medication,

36
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,035
and her hands swelled up
like the Marshmallow Man's.

37
00:02:18,104 --> 00:02:19,901
Jord, are you okay?

38
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,535
Jordan!

39
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:02,241
Foreman expects me to read an
x-ray on this itty-bitty screen.

40
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,943
He should have e-mailed
me a larger phone.

41
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,747
Why are you packing?

42
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,055
We're leaving this
afternoon for the conference

43
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,886
on pharmacology
and public policy.

44
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:13,357
We?
We discussed this.

45
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:14,791
It's been on your
calendar for weeks.

46
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,953
So has Ramadan.

47
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:20,295
Think of it as a vacation.
Nice, healthy Adirondack air.

48
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,732
Or not, I don't care.
You're coming with.

49
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:26,294
You should come with me. State
Pillow-Fighting Championships.

50
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,397
Dollar beers,
wet t-shirts.

51
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,374
In the words of the
philosopher Eddie Money,

52
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,104
"I've got two tickets
to paradise. "

53
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,545
House, when you moved in, I promised
your therapist I'd be here for you.

54
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,641
I can't be here if I'm there,
unless you're there, too.

55
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,912
So it's not a discussion.

56
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,613
Fine.

57
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:46,022
I'll let Foreman know that the 16-year-old
patient with the severe edema can wait.

58
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,422
Relax, I got no idea what's wrong
with her, so odds are not fatal.

59
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,155
Still not going.

60
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,033
She's got rhabdo.

61
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,173
Who wants to come to the
Pillow-Fighting Championships?

62
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,833
Rutgers has got a great team this year.

63
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,433
So glad their anchor
didn't turn pro.

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,775
Sixteen-year-old girl suddenly
has the joints of an 80-year-old.

65
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,280
You think we can discuss
this for a second?

66
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,907
It's rhabdo.

67
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,008
Patient gave you
the answer.

68
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,712
She fell down
and went boom.

69
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,949
We have to leave in an hour,
so should we eenie meenie?

70
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:20,220
The fall would explain the lower leg
damage, but not the swollen hands.

71
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:22,090
Hard landing caused
crushed muscles,

72
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,129
crushed muscles released
toxins into the bloodstream,

73
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,427
toxins caused swelling
in the hands and legs.

74
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,764
Just another way of saying
it's rhabdo. Fifty-nine minutes.

75
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,064
She's a credit-card kid.

76
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:34,629
Parents are architects. They're
working on a project in Shanghai.

77
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:38,268
Could you be sitting any further away
from Chase and still be in the same room?

78
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,572
It doesn't have
to be rhabdo.

79
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,807
The swelling could also be
caused by deep vein thrombosis.

80
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,644
She has allergies,
could be anaphylaxis,

81
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,183
or some heart condition
that we don't...

82
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:48,687
It can't really be any of
those things since it's rhabdo.

83
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,246
I know it's rhabdo,
Foreman knows it's rhabdo,

84
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:53,656
deep in his heart, even
Chase knows it's rhabdo.

85
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,923
Isn't it annoying when everybody in
the room knows something you don't?

86
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,190
I'll test for everything.

87
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,533
He's an ass.

88
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,869
Contrast is ready.

89
00:05:08,941 --> 00:05:11,171
She already thinks
I'm cheating on her.

90
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,508
Maybe this is House's way
of telling you to talk to her.

91
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,413
Sure. "How was your day, honey?
By the way, I killed someone. "

92
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:22,020
If I tell her, that's dumping
a burden on her forever.

93
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,088
Okay.

94
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,055
No sign of obstructions or clots.

95
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,898
Tell me what you
came here for, House.

96
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,636
I've got a legitimate medical reason.

97
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:47,043
You must be so proud.

98
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,410
I've forgotten it.

99
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,882
I guess it's no big deal
since I was only using it

100
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,977
as an excuse to come
check out Patty and Selma.

101
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,348
I feel bad. I haven't
named your testicles.

102
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,655
Word on the street is you set
a new personal best for low-cut.

103
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,720
I don't know why you chose to give
them the names of somebody's aunts.

104
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,664
It's a compliment.
They're always smoking.

105
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:12,600
I remember. I need you to authorize
the medical discharge of a minor.

106
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,368
That's why I'm holding this in my hand.

107
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,844
Haven't finished
testing yet, but it's...

108
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:25,275
Your outbox is three times normal
size. That's not a metaphor.

109
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,918
There's a lot to be done
before the weekend.

110
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:34,858
You could take papers home with
you. Unless you're not gonna be home.

111
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,294
Unless you were, for example,
going to a medical conference.

112
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:40,662
I'm driving up
with Wilson.

113
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,791
Me, too.

114
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,335
You aren't on the
registration list.

115
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,132
I love that you checked.

116
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,193
But Wilson said...

117
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,899
That I have a case? Yeah.

118
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:52,308
You're authorizing the discharge
right now. That was a metaphor.

119
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,219
I'm busy right now.

120
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,157
Is he dying?
Yeah.

121
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:11,630
In the next 10 minutes?

122
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:15,124
Unfortunately, no.
He's in a lot of pain.

123
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:20,033
I thought about it. You're right,
I should go to the conference.

124
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,869
You found out
Cuddy's going.

125
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,841
Oh, God, no.

126
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,302
She'll ruin everything.

127
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,148
We leave in two hours.

128
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,945
Please, morphine.

129
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,987
I'm right here.
I'm right here, Joseph.

130
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,972
Two days away. You think
I should pack Bally?

131
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,134
You can't leave. You lit a fuse,
you need to watch the bomb go off.

132
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,648
The bomb was gonna go off
on its own if you kept quiet.

133
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,183
So now you either have to
come up with a convincing lie

134
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,412
or tell her the truth.
Your choice.

135
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,619
CK levels point
to rhabdo.

136
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:11,850
Of course.

137
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:15,724
Except for the part where imaging
shows no sign of muscle crush.

138
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,910
Hi. I'm your doctor,

139
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,971
and this is Lars Ulrich, greatest
metal drummer of all time.

140
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,707
You know the song?

141
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:41,344
Good. Drumstick.

142
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,750
Here's another drumstick.

143
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:47,782
I want you to rock out to the
music, the way you did last night.

144
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,395
Come on. This is a classic medical test.

145
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,898
Hippocrates used it.
Let's go.

146
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:02,873
Come on, you gotta keep time.
Crossover on the high-hat.

147
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,538
Let's head-bang.

148
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,507
House, what
are you doing?

149
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,709
Chart said her
potassium's low.

150
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,649
Rhabdo elevates potassium.

151
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,710
And the monkey drums.

152
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:20,553
Ergo, her levels must have
been really low last night.

153
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:22,321
Which causes...

154
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,928
I can't move them.

155
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,096
...temporary muscle paralysis.
Given this rate of muscle fatigue,

156
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:37,108
there's no way she could have climbed
stairs and then a fence to the pool.

157
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:40,577
Low potassium means no
jump, means no trauma.

158
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,012
Tests mean,
yes, rhabdo.

159
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,246
Ergo, something else caused both
the rhabdo and the low potassium.

160
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,483
This time, start by
getting an accurate history.

161
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,020
Be careful, our
patient's a big, fat liar.

162
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,664
What did you
really do last night?

163
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,997
We need to find the cause
of your low potassium.

164
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,833
You could have a kidney
disorder, leukemia, adenoma.

165
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,100
We need to know about
any drugs or alcohol,

166
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,404
anything that might have
threatened your health.

167
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,000
Come on, Jord.

168
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,441
Okay, we didn't spend
the night with the band.

169
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,245
You can't tell
our friends.

170
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:22,549
<i>Have you heard of
Warrior Queen of Space?</i>

171
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,748
It's a comic book, right?

172
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:24,949
Thank you, yes...
Yeah.

173
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,356
...and a freaking amazing
new sci-fi series,

174
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:28,950
and they're filming
the motion picture now.

175
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,962
It's a prequel.

176
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,123
The other girls
wouldn't get it.

177
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,190
Only Phoebe understands my passion.

178
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,725
Only Phoebe understands
"the bushido of the heel. "

179
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,567
So what actually
happened last night?

180
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,837
<i>We were with our friends,</i>

181
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,572
<i>trying to get into the Pharmacide
tour party at the Adams.</i>

182
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,640
<i>And then I found out that
Jeffrey Keener was gonna be there.</i>

183
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,083
I follow his tweets.

184
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,014
It's tragic that
I have to explain this.

185
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:10,897
<i>He's the creator of Stiletto
issue number one and the TVshow.</i>

186
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,666
He's a god.

187
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:15,604
So did you guys
go up to him?

188
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,733
God, no.

189
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,302
We keep
a 10-foot rule.

190
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,972
It's not stalking if you don't go
up to the person and bother them.

191
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,107
So we just followed
him around.

192
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,241
Discreetly.

193
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:29,185
He ditched after half an hour and went down
to the hotel restaurant for a late dinner.

194
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,052
And you went with him?
Discreetly.

195
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,161
<i>We played it so cool.</i>

196
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,627
For two hours,
we lived his life.

197
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,659
We did everything he did, ate
the exact same meal he ate.

198
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,869
Cool.

199
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,672
The rest of
their story checks out.

200
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,801
Hotel manager says Mom and Dad
were charged for food and a room,

201
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:54,277
<i>three pay-per-view
episodes of Stiletto...</i>

202
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,838
You trying to kill yourself? It's
from the same batch the girls ate.

203
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,284
They ate what he ate, and what
100 other healthy people ate.

204
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,844
Dig in, lunch is
on the Adams.

205
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:05,550
What if food
is the answer?

206
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,685
Not this food, any food.
Jordan says she ate all of this.

207
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,696
She's 16, all
about body image,

208
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,891
and she obviously
worries about fitting in.

209
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,695
Bulimia would account
for her symptoms.

210
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,827
We should do a barium swallow
for Mallory-Weiss tears,

211
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,736
start her on nutritional
supplements, get a psych consult.

212
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,638
Why are you reading
my program guide?

213
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:28,737
It's not like you plan on
attending any of the presentations.

214
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,044
I like to know how much
boredom I'm missing.

215
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:37,518
"Patient perceptions of complications
in end-stage chemotherapy. "

216
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,649
You didn't tell me
you were giving a paper.

217
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:40,851
And that was wrong?

218
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,223
The last time you
presented a paper,

219
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,728
you gave me an advance copy
and asked for feedback.

220
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:49,029
And you're wondering why I wouldn't
want to repeat that experience?

221
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,365
Oh, look, an '80s party.

222
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,407
Just when you think you've left Flock of
Seagulls behind in your rear-view mirror,

223
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,806
suddenly it's up ahead
like an undead hitchhiker.

224
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,469
Cuddy's going.

225
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,539
Did you pack
my legwarmers?

226
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,017
If you want her,
ask her out.

227
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,713
My God, man.

228
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,654
She's not some
floozy in a bar,

229
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,783
she's the floozy
I work for.

230
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,890
There's gotta be no radical
steps here, gotta be subtle.

231
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,691
We happen to attend
the same party,

232
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:20,595
the chat happens
to turn personal.

233
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,157
Like the frog in
gradually boiling water.

234
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,429
Exactly.

235
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,937
She'll be red and delicious
before she knows it.

236
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,235
That's fun.

237
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,903
What could possibly
go wrong?

238
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,112
Chase went to the gym
five times this week.

239
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,377
Okay.

240
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,247
One of those times,
I followed him.

241
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,445
What?

242
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,514
I followed him. And, yes, I know
how humiliating that admission is.

243
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,317
Where'd he go?

244
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,952
The gym. That time.

245
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:51,053
But I know
that something's...

246
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,290
I'm stopping you
right there.

247
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:55,094
This is a conversation you should
be having with Chase, not me.

248
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,101
I've tried having this
conversation with Chase.

249
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,694
No sign of tears.
It's not bulimia.

250
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,966
Is he having an affair?

251
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,701
No.

252
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,434
Why should I believe you?

253
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,638
You shouldn't.
You should believe him.

254
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:12,642
Baby, how are you?
Sweetie.

255
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,877
Jordan.

256
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,480
Normal sinus rhythm.
Heart rate's fine.

257
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:20,582
BP's dropping. What's happening to her?

258
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:21,683
No pulse.

259
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:25,093
Oh, my God. You said
her heart rate was fine.

260
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,190
Cardiac tamponade,
drain the fluid now.

261
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,928
What is going on?

262
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:33,070
She's bleeding
around her heart.

263
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,069
Blood constricted
her heart muscle.

264
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:43,512
She's on antiarrhythmics, but we don't
know how long we can keep her stable.

265
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,076
<i>Seemed to be triggered by
stress. Her parents had just...</i>

266
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:48,619
Did her blood pressure drop
during the barium swallow?

267
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,654
Dropped to 50 systolic
in three minutes.

268
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,985
Rules out
chronic conditions.

269
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,990
Acute conditions limit us
to toxins, infections...

270
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,157
Could be anything. A gas leak, arsenic
in the wallpaper, fungus in the shower...

271
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,359
I'll get samples from her
room and the restaurant.

272
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:03,901
<i>Talk to our
little Gossip Girl.</i>

273
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,760
You need to know
exactly where she's been

274
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,705
and what she's done
in the last 24 hours.

275
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:09,866
Oh, I think...

276
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,417
Welcome to the
convention, Dr. Perlmutter.

277
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:22,750
It's my 25th
consecutive year.

278
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,119
Perlmutter loves the '80s.

279
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,431
Do you need me
to leave, too?

280
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:41,496
You might remember
stuff she doesn't.

281
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:44,303
We didn't do anything
we haven't told you about.

282
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:49,473
We hung out at Jordan's all day, and
then we called a limo to go into the city.

283
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,244
We stopped at Bruce
Springsteen's house.

284
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,680
Jord, don't joke
around, okay?

285
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,986
You're really sick.
Just tell him the truth.

286
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:04,284
Bruce let me play the first
electric guitar he ever owned.

287
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,524
My God,
why are you lying?

288
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,589
How can you
not believe me?

289
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,999
Turn to your right.

290
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,877
Mr. Keener, I really
appreciate you coming.

291
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:27,009
Oh, it's not that much of a hike.
My room's only six floors up.

292
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,249
Last night, do you remember
two girls, about 16?

293
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,222
That table right there.

294
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:33,952
They made an impression.

295
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:36,358
They were hard to miss, with
the giggling and the staring.

296
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,521
I'm sure that happens
to you a lot.

297
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:40,929
I'm sure that happens
to you a lot more.

298
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,206
She can't control it.

299
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:52,471
A bleed in her brain is affecting
her thalamus, causing her to lie.

300
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,980
We need to know everything.
You two were never apart?

301
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,481
Except for when
she went to go get ice.

302
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,416
But that couldn't
have taken very long.

303
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,476
You don't know?

304
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,919
It was in the
middle of the night.

305
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,150
I woke up when she came
back into the room.

306
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,853
And she told you
she went to get ice?

307
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,348
House.

308
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,250
1980s.

309
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:38,485
Are you sure?
They weren't specific.

310
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,752
How much did it
cost you to rent that?

311
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,657
It was in Wilson's bag.

312
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:46,658
Dr. Perlmutter. I read your
article on neural degeneration.

313
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:49,164
You didn't really take
that seriously, did you?

314
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,566
I just wrote that
for the money.

315
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:56,101
Well, hey, there, Jane Fonda,
would you care to dancercise?

316
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:59,167
Sorry, we were just
about to hit the floor.

317
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,575
Thank you.

318
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:02,739
Your leg?

319
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:06,046
I'm okay, as long as
you don't expect rhythm.

320
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,134
You remember the last time we danced?

321
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,073
Med school.
The week we met.

322
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,242
No.

323
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:39,279
I saw you in Endocrinology,
tracked you down to the hoe-down.

324
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:42,547
I meant we met before
that. In the bookstore.

325
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:46,149
Ah.

326
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,459
My third day of school.

327
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:53,089
I hand my syllabus to the
guy behind the counter.

328
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,725
He barely looks at me,
just skims the sheet

329
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,666
and tells me
I'm overly ambitious,

330
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:01,103
I have a chip on my shoulder
and I know how to party.

331
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,303
I'd forgotten you
knew how to party.

332
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,077
I said, "You're
making that up. "

333
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,445
Then you said, "Your class
schedule is overloaded,

334
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,780
"but none of your classes
are before 11:00,

335
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:18,187
"and no one takes Professor Lamb's course
unless they have something to prove. "

336
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,852
Because Professor Siegal covered the
same ground and was the easier grader.

337
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:26,557
I tracked you down.
Endocrinology, the party.

338
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,130
And one thing
led to another.

339
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,531
And then it didn't.

340
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,365
I was gonna call you.

341
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:39,137
No, don't do that.

342
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,536
There was no expectations.
I was just as into it...

343
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:44,343
I was gonna
come see you.

344
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,317
Figure out where things
would go from there.

345
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,083
That was the morning I
got the call from the dean,

346
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:54,182
and I was expelled from my first med
school. There didn't seem any point.

347
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:03,090
I should go to my room and review
papers for the infectious disease panel.

348
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,216
Hello.

349
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,823
Yeah. Thanks
for telling me.

350
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:37,127
It's 7:00 in the morning.
Somebody better be dead.

351
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,368
My patient.
Joseph Schultz.

352
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,768
Oh.

353
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:52,843
Under the circumstances, it was the best
thing that could have happened, right?

354
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,183
Yeah. I just wish
I'd been there.

355
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:00,154
Didn't hear you
come in last night.

356
00:21:00,225 --> 00:21:02,693
Yes, it was almost 9:30.

357
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,661
Things didn't go
as you planned?

358
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,698
We've moved on
to a new phase.

359
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,394
I tell Cuddy that I've always been interested
in her, and she walks out of the room.

360
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,664
Well, either she
just wasn't ready for that,

361
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:17,903
or maybe she was just surprised
and didn't know how to react.

362
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:21,471
What are you doing?

363
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,343
Interesting reflex
of guilt just now.

364
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,975
Your patient's been
dying for six weeks,

365
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,884
you couldn't have predicted
that he'd go this weekend.

366
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,387
Or could you?

367
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:42,863
"Euthanasia. Let's tell
the truth. We all do it. "

368
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,067
It's a great opening line.

369
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,663
Are you insane?

370
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,938
I didn't want
your notes before,

371
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,534
and I don't want them now.

372
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,755
Well, she didn't get ice.

373
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,815
She got out in the lobby.
She could've gone anywhere.

374
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,828
Let's start with for
how long. Fast forward.

375
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:16,223
Stop. Rewind. Back.

376
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,963
Wherever she went, she was
only gone for like five minutes.

377
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:22,366
She's holding something.

378
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,635
That's
Keener's journal.

379
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,075
He must have left it in
the restaurant that night.

380
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:28,044
She went back, claimed
it belonged to her.

381
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,104
She was looking for an
excuse to knock on his door.

382
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,249
I know what
you're gonna say.

383
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:42,555
I'm not insane.
Doctors are rarely indicted.

384
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,723
I was just thinking
of your career.

385
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,031
But, yeah, if you're one of the
doctors occasionally indicted,

386
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:53,537
I guess it could
affect that.

387
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:59,066
Someone needs to say what life is really
like, now, for people who are dying.

388
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,372
What doctors
have to go through.

389
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,538
The decisions
we have to make.

390
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:04,172
Alone.
Without guidance.

391
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:08,515
<i>Someone should say that, in an
unsigned letter to the Times.</i>

392
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,055
I'd be telling the truth. I'd be
saying what we're all thinking.

393
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,454
Who cares?

394
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,754
The oncology department is
subsidized by drug companies,

395
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:16,726
they don't want it
run by a murderer.

396
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,888
We're all murderers. We just
don't have the guts to admit...

397
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,727
And once again,
who cares?

398
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,926
You won't be hirable.
Anywhere.

399
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,833
If there's one thing
I've learned from you,

400
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,804
it's that I should do
what I think is right,

401
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,501
and not worry about
the consequences.

402
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:36,209
Yeah, it's worked
out great for me.

403
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:48,383
I don't mean to be rude,

404
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,485
but I'm expecting a notes call
from LA. Can we make this quick?

405
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,393
Did Jordan come to your
room the other night?

406
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:56,628
Let me put it another way. We know
Jordan came to your room the other night.

407
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,101
Look, I've tried
to be helpful.

408
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,571
I don't know why you want
to pretend I'm lying to you,

409
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,629
but this is getting
too weird for me.

410
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,299
We need
to search your room.

411
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,537
You don't, because
she was never here.

412
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,843
Allison, calm down.

413
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,082
You would cover your ass at
the expense of someone's life?

414
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,812
We know she brought up your journal.

415
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:21,921
That was helpful.

416
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:26,119
He'd be crazy to risk his marriage
for a one-night stand. With a teenager.

417
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,326
Sensible people only risk their
marriage for something more serious?

418
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,266
I'm not having an affair.

419
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:32,496
We're talking
about Keener.

420
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:33,936
Fine.

421
00:24:34,005 --> 00:24:36,371
He doesn't care about his
marriage, what about his career?

422
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:37,669
Statutory rape
would ruin it.

423
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:40,210
It's admitting statutory
rape that could ruin it.

424
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,644
Which is why we'll never
hear the truth out of him.

425
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,409
Roofies OD explains
all her symptoms.

426
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,576
We should start treating
her with flumazenil.

427
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,551
Isn't the MRSA
panel going on?

428
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,955
We got kicked out.
She started crying.

429
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:58,121
Yeah, well, discussions of urinary
catheterization will do that to me, too.

430
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,027
The babysitter
had an emergency.

431
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,492
Oh, how did you
like '80s Night?

432
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,696
House talked with you?

433
00:25:07,939 --> 00:25:12,137
I was being subtle about
it. You left suddenly.

434
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,078
I know House can be
a little much sometimes.

435
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:18,946
He was sweet. I just know
better than to rely on that.

436
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:21,875
He's trying.

437
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:23,386
Yeah. I know.

438
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:30,217
I'm a mother now. I need a guy
I can count on every single day.

439
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,922
That's never been House.

440
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,907
It's not roofies. She's
bleeding behind her kidneys.

441
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:46,239
We're transfusing another
two units packed red cells,

442
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,744
but she keeps
springing leaks.

443
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,939
It looks like
a toxic reaction.

444
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,607
Keener must have
given her something.

445
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,379
The guy's a comic book
writer, not a drug dealer.

446
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,511
There's a lot that wouldn't
show up on a standard tox screen.

447
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,749
But he's never gonna
tell us the truth.

448
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,485
We're not going to get the
truth out of her either.

449
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:06,489
We will if we drug her.

450
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,460
Amobarbital would
suppress her thalamus.

451
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:13,902
She's on antiarrhythmics.
Amobarbital could stop her heart.

452
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,803
She's already dying.

453
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:18,632
You're angry at me.

454
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,770
You're taking it out on this guy
'cause you think he's lying to you, too,

455
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:24,679
and you're going to kill
our patient in the process.

456
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:27,382
We need
to know the truth.

457
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,942
We should call House.

458
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:32,217
Yeah, he'll recommend
we take the cautious approach.

459
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:40,789
Pretzel?

460
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:43,959
Those are gonna show up on my
credit card at seven bucks a bag.

461
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,094
There's an all-you-can-
eat buffet downstairs.

462
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:50,904
Studies show that $10 wine tastes
better if you're told that it costs $90.

463
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,579
I'm sure the same thing
must be true of grape soda.

464
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,579
Have one.

465
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,818
We can toast your
impending unemployment.

466
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:11,255
Yes, you can sit here
running up my hotel bill,

467
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,763
or you can go get the
woman of your dreams.

468
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,064
I didn't know Angela Merkel
was attending the conference.

469
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,593
I just spoke with Cuddy. She
doesn't think you're reliable.

470
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:25,041
And you will remain
friend-zoned until that changes.

471
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,046
I can't convince her that I've changed
my entire personality in a weekend.

472
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:32,015
Yeah, but you could
make the first step.

473
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,107
What does she need?

474
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:34,947
Today, a babysitter.

475
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,688
What are you
thinking about?

476
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:41,851
Fjords.

477
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:46,727
You see? Seriously, I know this
is out of your comfort zone,

478
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:50,825
but don't scheme, don't...
Just do the deed...

479
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,767
You tell me that I gotta
show her I've changed,

480
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,806
and yet you act like
you don't believe I can.

481
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,035
If I can't convince
my best friend...

482
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:02,409
I'm sorry, and that's... I
didn't mean... I didn't mean...

483
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,946
I didn't mean...

484
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,813
You drugged me.

485
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,391
She's better off
without you.

486
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,060
Words can hurt,
you know.

487
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,606
I thought truth serum was only stuff
they gave people in lame spy movies.

488
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:35,009
We know you're scared, and we
know you want to tell the truth.

489
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,809
We're going to
help you do that.

490
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,577
<i>What happened between you and Keener
the night you went up to his room?</i>

491
00:28:44,355 --> 00:28:47,290
<i>I couldn't believe
he even talked to me.</i>

492
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,962
<i>I told him how much
his work means to me.</i>

493
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,935
I figured I must sound like a
moron, but he was nice about it.

494
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,773
<i>He said I was special.</i>

495
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:06,132
Heart rate's increasing.

496
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,236
140's acceptable.
Let her talk.

497
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:11,214
Did he give you
anything, a drink, pills?

498
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,648
<i>He said it was Ecstasy.</i>

499
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,413
<i>But it didn't
look like Ecstasy.</i>

500
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,423
<i>And it didn't really make me
feel how Ecstasy usually does.</i>

501
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,220
How did it
make you feel?

502
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:23,226
It just made me
really tired.

503
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,127
What did it look like?
A capsule? Tablet?

504
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,688
It was a tablet.
Round.

505
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,924
Could be lithium.

506
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:32,999
<i>He just started
touching me.</i>

507
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:36,666
<i>At first, it seemed
nice, but then...</i>

508
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,277
I didn't want
to insult him.

509
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,505
That's enough.

510
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:46,539
I'm so sorry.

511
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,351
I love you guys
so much and I just...

512
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:54,121
I feel like
I've let you down.

513
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,293
I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna
kill that son of a bitch.

514
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,728
Before you do that,
look here.

515
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,427
Increased periorbital
blood flow throughout.

516
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:06,868
It means everything she's
been saying has been a lie.

517
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,097
Everything?

518
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:14,409
So you still don't know
what's wrong with her?

519
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,878
Sorry.

520
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,443
I thought you
were room service.

521
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,456
Is something going on
with your patient?

522
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,391
It's quiet in there.
Is Rachel asleep?

523
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,687
I thought maybe you
could use a babysitter.

524
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:39,828
Actually, I've got her
in daycare downstairs.

525
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:40,893
Oh.

526
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:44,373
Great. Maybe later.

527
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:05,629
Hey, House.

528
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,288
Hey, Lucas.

529
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:09,927
This is awkward.

530
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,127
A bit.

531
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,638
That awkwardness would
probably go away if I left.

532
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:38,123
Hello?
It's Foreman.

533
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:39,959
I'm trying to update
House, but his phone's off.

534
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,561
House!

535
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,727
He's not here.

536
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:48,169
Patient's losing blood
faster than we can transfuse.

537
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,901
Cameron did an online search, found
out Keener travels with his dog.

538
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:54,001
We're treating for Rickettsia.
Any idea where he is?

539
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:58,071
Oh, no! I was supposed to be
giving a paper five minutes ago.

540
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,746
Okay. Okay.

541
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:08,157
Dr. Wilson has asked me to tender
his apologies for his absence.

542
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,592
You'll be hearing
my paper instead.

543
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:14,426
Unfortunately, there wasn't time
to correct the program schedule.

544
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:19,061
Euthanasia.
Let's tell the truth.

545
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:23,431
We all do it. We just
don't talk about it.

546
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:28,335
We play the game. We use other words,
or we don't use any words at all.

547
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:29,568
Hmm.

548
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:31,371
Nice phrasing.

549
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:35,082
Hello.

550
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,384
I don't know what
department I want. I need

551
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:44,853
pants.

552
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:49,730
Patient S, 55-year-old man
end-stage lung cancer.

553
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:54,295
His pain was beyond the point where
we could even pretend to treat it.

554
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,533
I showed him how to
use the morphine pump.

555
00:32:56,607 --> 00:32:58,837
I told him too much
morphine would kill him,

556
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,869
but not to worry, the machine
only gives out so much.

557
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:06,212
To override it, you need
to enter a special code.

558
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,445
I went to the door
and told the nurse,

559
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,478
"The code is 328."
I said it loudly.

560
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:17,524
When he first
came to my office,

561
00:33:17,595 --> 00:33:21,463
I'd told him I would be with
him every step of the way.

562
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,258
But I left him
alone at the end.

563
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,065
I broke that promise.

564
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:31,200
To cover my ass,
I failed...

565
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:44,218
I was wrong
when I wrote that.

566
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:47,653
I've never given
any less than my best.

567
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,555
I'm incapable of turning
away from a responsibility.

568
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:58,931
My friends take advantage
of that fact far too often.

569
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,664
I know that I gave that
man everything I could.

570
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,174
And I know that
he knew that, too.

571
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:12,948
This is a burden no one
should have to carry alone.

572
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,349
And this is a decision
no one should make alone.

573
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,322
Because, frankly,
I don't trust all of you.

574
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,118
Doctor! Doctor!

575
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,756
Doctor! Question!

576
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:32,165
Excuse me, Doctor. Not many
people would have your courage.

577
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,863
Thank you,
Dr. Perlmutter.

578
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:46,444
Hey!

579
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:52,718
Before I start shouting, Foreman
says they're looking at Rickettsia.

580
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,190
Thanks for the
message. Continue.

581
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,453
What the hell?

582
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,427
You think that little shout
out is gonna make me forget

583
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:01,624
that you drugged me, hid
my pants, stole my speech?

584
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:04,463
You wanted the paper out
there. It's out there.

585
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:05,900
And your job is safe.

586
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,164
That was my paper.

587
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,901
You don't ask what I want, you
ignore my wishes, you drug me...

588
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,808
I'm waiting for you to name
something new to our relationship.

589
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:16,312
You got no good reason
to be angry with me.

590
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,008
Oh, really? I should be thanking you?

591
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,574
If this was about getting the
story out there, then, yeah.

592
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,813
Of course, if this is
actually about something else,

593
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,482
maybe you feeling impotent
because patients keep dying,

594
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:29,617
and you think you need to make some
grand, stupid gesture, need to be a hero,

595
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:33,391
well, then, yeah,
sorry, I did screw it up.

596
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,428
You stepped over the line.
This was not your decision.

597
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:41,529
My God, there are 10,000
oncologists in this country,

598
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:43,130
every one of them
loses patients,

599
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:44,936
but only you would
feel guilty enough...

600
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,909
Of course. We can't even
argue on my schedule.

601
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:58,613
It's House.

602
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:05,862
<i>Take down the bags.</i>

603
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:07,329
It's too soon to tell
if the meds are gonna...

604
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:08,763
<i>It's not the meds.</i>

605
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,724
It's the blood
that's killing her.

606
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,569
<i>What's everybody doing?
You're stunned, right?</i>

607
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,162
I mean, blood?

608
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:18,299
She's had internal bleeding,
she needs the blood to...

609
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,539
<i>Is that the mom? I got a
good comeback if it's the mom.</i>

610
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,876
Yes, I'm her mother.

611
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,076
Sure, she needs blood,
if you want to kill her.

612
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:30,076
<i>Then you'd have nobody
left to neglect. Great plan.</i>

613
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,554
<i>Your daughter has
Vibrio vulnificus,</i>

614
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:35,786
courtesy of a few scrumptious
oysters on the half shell.

615
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,956
I didn't eat any oysters.

616
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,497
Thus proving that she
did. Boy, that's neat.

617
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,931
A hundred other people
ate those oysters. I ate...

618
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,127
Is that the dad?
I got a good comeback if...

619
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,465
It's Chase.

620
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,799
Oh. Thought the dad might
have been Australian, too.

621
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:53,002
There was nothing wrong with the
oysters. All oysters have Vibrio.

622
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:56,012
But almost no one
has hemochromatosis.

623
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:00,350
<i>It'd give her a unique susceptibility
to Vibrio, cause the swollen joints.</i>

624
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,615
It got attributed to bulimia,
so she got supplements.

625
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,916
With iron.

626
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,480
<i>Which overcooked the liver,
which caused bleeding.</i>

627
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:10,521
More blood, more iron,
more bleeding, more blood.

628
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:12,028
Is she going to be okay?

629
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:15,094
Only if we give her high-dose
ceftazidime for the Vibrio

630
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,259
<i>and chelate for
the hemochromatosis.</i>

631
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:20,270
Now, Cameron, pick up the phone
and give me a dramatic exit.

632
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:37,117
So, how did you
two crazy kids hook up?

633
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,986
I suspected someone in
accounting was skimming money,

634
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:42,082
and I wanted to
investigate quietly.

635
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:46,289
And since you introduced me
to the only detective I know...

636
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,127
One thing
leads to another.

637
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:58,965
Why keep it a secret? Were you
protecting me in my fragile state?

638
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:00,442
You think I was
an unhinged loony

639
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,844
who was about to go off the rails
at a badly-timed bit of news?

640
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,678
I just don't advertise
my personal life.

641
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:09,311
I needed help with the
baby, Lucas drove up.

642
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,082
Yeah, she was worried.

643
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,982
A little worried.
As a friend.

644
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:21,425
I had to hide in our room and be the
dirty little secret. Kind of sucked.

645
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,228
I told her it
wasn't necessary.

646
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,702
So you had some hallucination
about having sex with her.

647
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,365
I don't think
we need to talk...

648
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,604
I mean, I imagine having sex with
women all the time. No big deal.

649
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:38,206
Though I guess if they knew what
I imagined, it could get awkward.

650
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:43,083
And I guess it's different because
in the fantasy, she was your savior.

651
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:45,214
But I mean, that was
months ago, right?

652
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,849
All the work that you
had to do to get straight.

653
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,224
You've been institutionalized, you've
had way bigger stuff to deal with.

654
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,024
I should shut up.

655
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:00,130
Can I buy you
a ginger ale?

656
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,502
Ginger ale would
be good. With lemon.

657
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,075
Infection's
clearing up nicely.

658
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,637
You should be out of
here in a few days.

659
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,650
That is wonderful.

660
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:17,816
Jack, how are you?

661
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,116
Sweetie,

662
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,956
your father and I think we should
reward ourselves with a little time off.

663
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,187
That meeting's gonna have
to wait a couple of weeks.

664
00:39:25,262 --> 00:39:27,492
We're staying here.

665
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:29,692
You should think about
where you'd like to go.

666
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:31,894
Honey, they're saying the specs
are off for the whole foundation.

667
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,368
Can you at least
come talk to him?

668
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,132
Let me see.

669
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,645
You okay?
Yeah.

670
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:47,706
No. Soil engineering
report was fine.

671
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,218
I'm used to it.

672
00:39:49,286 --> 00:39:52,221
So, about what
happened that night...

673
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,831
<i>I never even got up the
courage to knock on his door.</i>

674
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,635
Well, you'll have to
send me their numbers.

675
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,509
Yay!

676
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:28,255
You want to go driving?

677
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,492
He looks like a guy
who'd be there every day.

678
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,462
Mini-bar's re-stocked. I say we
grab some pretzels for the road...

679
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,900
When you do what I did,

680
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,632
it's not enough to tell
yourself you did nothing wrong.

681
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:44,606
You need to hear it
from someone else.

682
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:51,672
If not God or society, a
friend, otherwise you go crazy.

683
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,981
What you said
to me up there...

684
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,483
Thank you.

685
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:03,220
You're a good friend.
Cuddy should know that.

686
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,291
Yeah, you should let her
know that I drugged you

687
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:09,992
so you wouldn't confess to
murder. Let's get out of here.

688
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,635
Someone could have
recognized you.

689
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:17,902
First US conference
I've attended in 15 years.

690
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,306
Perlmutter?

691
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,072
Toronto, all weekend, airtight alibi.

692
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,055
I'm sorry.

693
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:39,054
I don't know why I
always suspect the worst.

694
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,760
If you say you're
not having an affair,

695
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,630
you're not
having an affair.

696
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,138
Oh, God. You are?
I'm not.

697
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,578
Okay. Sorry. Again.

698
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:06,848
If you don't wanna tell,

699
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:09,854
okay.

700
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,860
But I could help.

701
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:18,091
Whatever this is,
it's eating away at you.

702
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,734
We could get
past it together.

703
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,135
I love you
no matter what.

704
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:42,285
We lose patients sometimes.

705
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,254
One of those patients,

706
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:50,899
Dibala,

707
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,332
we didn't actually
lose him.

708
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:02,968
I killed him.
