111
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,828
It's a disease called
transverse myelitis.

[patient screams]

181
00:08:36,066 --> 00:08:37,633
Is Tucker settling in?

182
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:40,035
Yeah. Already got
his first dose of acyclovir.

183
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,237
And don't worry,

184
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:42,638
I ordered his girlfriend
the kiddy meal.

185
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,907
Hoo-ah.
Next patient on deck.

186
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:46,509
Del Clinton.
Day six of chemo.

187
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:47,710
You just missed
the grandkids.

188
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,779
Oh, that's all right.

189
00:08:49,846 --> 00:08:52,648
Last time they were here,
they painted my tie.

190
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,253
You're almost ready
to go home.

191
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,587
You feeling okay?

192
00:08:58,655 --> 00:09:02,324
I feel like I felt
after the last four rounds.

193
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:04,927
In oncology, familiar pain
means all is well.

194
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:06,562
So that's good, right?

195
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,297
Yeah.
[pager sounds]

196
00:09:08,365 --> 00:09:09,698
I heard Jesse and Zeke
were by earlier.

197
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,801
Yeah.

198
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:15,304
Sorry, Del, I gotta run.

199
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:20,810
How are they doing?

200
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:22,711
They--they're fine.

201
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,115
No game-winning hits?
No aced report cards?

202
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:27,149
No school plays?

203
00:09:27,217 --> 00:09:29,685
I guess not.

204
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,687
I thought you had to go.

205
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:36,292
Are you depressed?

206
00:09:36,359 --> 00:09:38,093
I have cancer.

207
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,596
You've had cancer
for a long time.

208
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:42,464
It's never stopped you
from bragging

209
00:09:42,532 --> 00:09:43,966
<i>about the grandkids.</i>

210
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:47,503
I guess I'm feeling a little
more down than usual.

211
00:09:47,571 --> 00:09:49,305
<i>Can you give me something?</i>

212
00:09:49,372 --> 00:09:52,208
Yeah. I don't want you
to get alarmed,

213
00:09:52,275 --> 00:09:54,143
but sometimes depression
can be a sign

214
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:55,778
that something else
is going on.

215
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,314
I'm just gonna order
a couple of extra tests.

216
00:09:58,381 --> 00:09:59,748
Okay?

217
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,924
What's going on?
It's his foot now.

218
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:10,593
It's nothing.
It's not nothing.

219
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,028
I just started getting
a little tingling feeling

220
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:15,364
in my foot.

221
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:16,465
Is that bad?

222
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,633
Ashley,
it's gonna be okay.

223
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,668
It might mean his foot
fell asleep.

224
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:20,970
<i>It might mean nothing.</i>

225
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,571
Could you give us
a few minutes?

226
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:23,839
What--why can't you
tell me?

227
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:25,908
Because
you're making him nervous.

228
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:28,744
Just give us a few minutes,
okay, hon?

229
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,481
Does this mean
that it's not the disease

230
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:33,749
<i>you thought it was?</i>

231
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,351
It means the medicine
I gave you is not working.

232
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:36,952
I just might have
to hit it harder.

233
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,222
I'm going to add ribavirin
to your treatment.

234
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,524
Jim.

235
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:44,293
Are you sure that
this isn't a recurrence?

236
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:46,629
So the brave face
is just for Ashley.

237
00:10:46,696 --> 00:10:49,331
She's young.
She's terrified.

238
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,733
<i>She's not really equipped.
- Don't worry.</i>

239
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,069
Once you've had cancer,

240
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:56,305
recurrence is your biggest fear.
I get it.

241
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:58,974
I've looked at this thing
every which way there is.

242
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,409
That's not
what's happening here.

243
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:03,579
Can you call my daughter
and ask her to come down?

244
00:11:03,647 --> 00:11:05,214
You can't do it?

245
00:11:05,282 --> 00:11:08,250
She hasn't exactly
been talking to me

246
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:09,818
since I got together
with Ashley.

247
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:13,522
I'd really like her
to be here.

248
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,024
Of course.

249
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:19,161
Exactly how serious
does it have to be

250
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:23,032
to justify you coming
to see your father?

251
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,767
No. I'm sorry.

252
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:26,969
I just--I'd rather
you regretted coming

253
00:11:27,037 --> 00:11:28,904
than regretted not coming.

254
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,808
Thanks, Emily.

255
00:11:34,077 --> 00:11:35,511
How's Tucker?

256
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,746
Oh, well, he's made a mess
of his personal life.

257
00:11:37,814 --> 00:11:39,281
But physically,
I think he's gonna be fine.

258
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,983
Transverse myelitis.

259
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:42,184
What does House think?

260
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:44,320
What is this?

261
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:45,888
Is House my overseer now?

262
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:48,490
No, it's just not always
a good idea

263
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:49,625
for doctors to treat

264
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:50,826
their friends,
that's all.

265
00:11:50,894 --> 00:11:53,062
Well, House has got
100 bucks on cancer.

266
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,030
So unless you want in
on the action...

267
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:58,133
um, is Bonnie
still a realtor?

268
00:11:58,201 --> 00:11:59,835
As far as I know.

269
00:11:59,903 --> 00:12:02,004
Do you mind
if I call her?

270
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:05,207
I'm, uh, looking
for a new place.

271
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:07,843
I'm moving in with Lucas.

272
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:08,978
(Taub)
it wasn't the tennis.

273
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:12,147
You're moving in
with Lucas?

274
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:15,117
Yes.

275
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,251
You're Bonnie's friend.

276
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,686
You know
how to reach her.

277
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,521
And yet instead
of calling her,

278
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:21,056
you come and seek
my permission.

279
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:22,524
You want my blessing,

280
00:12:22,592 --> 00:12:24,360
and implicitly,
House's blessing.

281
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:26,962
I don't need
House's blessing.

282
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,198
Good.

283
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,740
So when will he be able
to move his arm again?

284
00:12:37,807 --> 00:12:39,274
Should be soon.
[coughs]

285
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,342
Started smoking again?

286
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,944
[coughs] No.

287
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,346
What--what does that mean?
Is it bad that he's coughing?

288
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:47,016
Hi, dad.
Hey.

289
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,184
Melissa, hey.
[clears throat]

290
00:12:49,252 --> 00:12:50,219
I didn't know
you were coming.

291
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:51,820
I was at Mom's house

292
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:52,921
<i>when Dr. Wilson called.</i>

293
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,256
I can go
if it's gonna be weird.

294
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:57,092
[coughs] No, no. Stay.
It's fine.

295
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,727
Hi.
How are you?

296
00:12:58,795 --> 00:12:59,762
Is he okay?

297
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:01,930
Yeah. He's okay.

298
00:13:01,998 --> 00:13:03,999
I'm not a big fan
of this coughing though.

299
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:05,100
You must be Ashley.

300
00:13:05,168 --> 00:13:07,669
Hi.
[coughs]

301
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:10,105
Hey, are you okay?
[gasping]

302
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:12,374
do you think
this cold sore thing

303
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:13,609
<i>could've caused this?</i>

304
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:15,177
No. Whatever's causing this

305
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:16,779
is affecting more than
his nerves.

306
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:18,547
I need a crash cart
in here!

307
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:20,783
[coughing and gasping]

308
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:29,095
Don't you guys have
a dying Mexican crooner

309
00:13:29,162 --> 00:13:31,130
to attend to?
He isn't dying anymore.

310
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:33,266
Found out
he was on a popcorn diet.

311
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,868
Eating ten bags
of microwave popcorn a day.

312
00:13:35,936 --> 00:13:37,537
Huffing the fumes
scared his lungs.

313
00:13:37,604 --> 00:13:42,074
Wow, that's...
very strange.

314
00:13:42,142 --> 00:13:43,342
Where's House?

315
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,378
Performing his ritual
"hiding from Cuddy

316
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:47,280
to avoid getting
a new case" dance.

317
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:50,116
It's sort of a jazz-fusion
type of thing.

318
00:13:50,183 --> 00:13:51,817
He's probably eating lunch
in the morgue.

319
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:53,786
<i>I can page him to your office
if you want. Actually...</i>

320
00:13:53,854 --> 00:13:56,255
maybe it would be better
if I talked to you guys alone.

321
00:13:56,323 --> 00:13:58,991
<i>House and I have a bet
about one of my patients.</i>

322
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:01,794
You guys mind making him
100 bucks poorer?

323
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:06,566
43-year-old male
in remission from leukemia

324
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:08,834
presents with left arm paralysis
and trouble breathing.

325
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:11,103
I assume House's money
is on cancer.

326
00:14:11,171 --> 00:14:12,271
Thanks.
That's very helpful.

327
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:13,839
Subdural hematoma
would explain--

328
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:15,174
CT ruled it out.

329
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:16,909
I thought it was tm
so I started him on antivirals,

330
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:17,944
but he got worse.

331
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:19,245
Bacterial infection?

332
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:20,846
Bacteria would move
much faster than this.

333
00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:21,847
He'd be dead already.

334
00:14:21,915 --> 00:14:23,683
Could be fungal.

335
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,651
Fungal infection would explain
his breathing problem,

336
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:27,353
but not his "unable to move
his arm" problem.

337
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:31,390
Actually,
if aspergillus fungus balls

338
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:34,927
took root in his lungs
and spread to his spine,

339
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:37,663
it would explain both.

340
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:39,599
Thanks.

341
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:44,637
The treatment involves riddling
the infected area

342
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:47,139
with bb-sized pellets
of antifungal meds.

343
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:49,675
I assume you don't just
load up the 12-gauge

344
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:51,544
and pepper me
with birdshot.

345
00:14:51,612 --> 00:14:54,780
<i>No. We have a slightly
more humane delivery system.</i>

346
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:57,350
But we do have to open you up.
It is surgery.

347
00:14:57,417 --> 00:14:59,185
<i>And like any operation,</i>

348
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:00,953
there are risks.

349
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:04,290
What do you think,
honey?

350
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:06,058
I-I don't know.

351
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:07,860
I mean, is surgery
really such a good idea?

352
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:08,928
He just seems so sick.

353
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:10,696
<i>I just--</i>

354
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:14,000
you should do
whatever you think is best.

355
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,668
Is this the only way

356
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:17,470
to go after this thing?

357
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:18,938
Because of the rapid
progression,

358
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:21,073
I don't think we have time
to test or try ivs.

359
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:22,642
And he's strong enough
to endure anesthesia.

360
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:23,809
Definitely.

361
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:25,378
I want you there
during the surgery.

362
00:15:25,445 --> 00:15:26,445
Of course.

363
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:29,749
You gotta do it.

364
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:35,087
Good. Dr. Chase
will be in here soon

365
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:37,156
to get you set for the O.R.

366
00:15:37,224 --> 00:15:40,626
Page Dr. Chase to Tucker's room
for a surgery consult.

367
00:15:40,694 --> 00:15:41,827
And can you get me--

368
00:15:41,895 --> 00:15:43,929
Uh, Mr. Koplovitz wants
to talk to you.

369
00:15:43,997 --> 00:15:45,164
Is everything all right?

370
00:15:45,232 --> 00:15:46,332
He wanted to talk
to his doctor,

371
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,100
not his doctor's assistant.

372
00:15:48,168 --> 00:15:50,069
Oh, and House is looking
for you.

373
00:15:50,137 --> 00:15:51,937
What did you tell him?
That you were in the clinic.

374
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:54,173
I figure that gives you
about ten minutes.

375
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:56,375
Here.
Mr. Koplovitz's chart. Go.

376
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:01,647
Hello, Saul.

377
00:16:01,715 --> 00:16:03,249
I heard you were looking
for me.

378
00:16:03,316 --> 00:16:04,417
I'm very tired.

379
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:06,719
But I can't sleep.

380
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:08,087
Today's your lucky day.

381
00:16:08,155 --> 00:16:10,990
I happen to be
a sleep specialist.

382
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:13,092
Thanks, Doc.

383
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:18,097
[toilet flushes]

384
00:16:27,274 --> 00:16:29,208
Hey. Can a guy get
a little privacy?

385
00:16:29,276 --> 00:16:30,609
Nice hiding spot.

386
00:16:30,677 --> 00:16:32,111
Actually, it's perfect.

387
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,147
It allows me to hide from Cuddy
and find you.

388
00:16:35,215 --> 00:16:36,982
What did she want?

389
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,218
She was checking up on Tucker
thanks to you.

390
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:40,319
That's it?

391
00:16:40,387 --> 00:16:43,656
Like what?
Something about you?

392
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:45,925
Something you could interpret
as being about you?

393
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:47,927
An anagram maybe?

394
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:50,029
It'd be great if you could play
hide and seek somewhere else.

395
00:16:50,097 --> 00:16:51,464
My patient just--
no problem.

396
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:53,365
Just give me the 100 bucks
you owe me and I'm gone.

397
00:16:53,433 --> 00:16:54,533
Tucker doesn't have cancer.

398
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:56,602
He doesn't have
a ball of fungus

399
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,703
in his lungs either.

400
00:16:57,771 --> 00:16:58,971
Next time you want
to use my team,

401
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,306
I suggest
you at least leave a tip.

402
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:03,576
I'm late for surgery.

403
00:17:03,643 --> 00:17:04,810
Ah, your assistant said
you'd be in here.

404
00:17:04,878 --> 00:17:06,245
I talked to Bonnie.

405
00:17:06,313 --> 00:17:07,413
Let's take this outside.

406
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:09,148
Mr. Koplovitz
just got to sleep.

407
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:11,150
Oh, sorry. She found us
this fantastic loft.

408
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:12,518
Outside. I mean,
it's not a loft really,

409
00:17:12,586 --> 00:17:13,619
it's just more urban.

410
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:14,820
Not that I'm urban,
but I used to be.

411
00:17:14,888 --> 00:17:16,288
It's got two bedrooms.
Got wonderful views.

412
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:17,590
<i>It's a really great place.</i>

413
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,492
Procedure should take
about an hour.

414
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,560
I'll be observing
the entire time.

415
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:23,195
Thanks.

416
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:25,431
Maybe it'd be better
if you stayed with Ashley.

417
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:26,899
She's more scared
than I am.

418
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:31,070
[chuckles]
Well, she's...

419
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:33,372
at her age...

420
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,275
she's not supposed to be dealing
with issues of life and death.

421
00:17:36,343 --> 00:17:40,746
Wasn't what I was planning
when I went after her.

422
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:42,381
Why did you leave Melissa?

423
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:46,418
We got married young.
We...

424
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,391
I'm not sure.

425
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:04,370
[door opens]

426
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:08,340
There's nothing
to talk about.

427
00:18:11,178 --> 00:18:12,711
Why are you doing surgery
when I need you

428
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,079
finding me a new case?

429
00:18:14,147 --> 00:18:16,148
You don't want
a new case.

430
00:18:16,216 --> 00:18:17,516
Oh, right.

431
00:18:17,584 --> 00:18:19,919
Guess I'm here for Wilson.

432
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:23,122
<i>Obviously
you didn't tell me</i>

433
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,790
that Cuddy was moving in
with Lucas

434
00:18:24,858 --> 00:18:25,991
'cause you were
protecting me.

435
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:28,594
Which is odd
since I told you

436
00:18:28,662 --> 00:18:30,062
that I'm fine
with their relationship.

437
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:32,832
So obviously,

438
00:18:32,899 --> 00:18:34,433
you question
one of those assumptions

439
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:35,968
or you have an issue
with logic.

440
00:18:36,036 --> 00:18:38,604
Yes, you're fine
with them dating.

441
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:40,806
But moving in together

442
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:43,108
is a whole other level
of commitment.

443
00:18:43,176 --> 00:18:45,344
[scoffs] This is
the 21st century, Wilson.

444
00:18:45,412 --> 00:18:47,513
I realize
that the logical course

445
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:49,481
of any adult relationship

446
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:52,418
could one day lead
to fornication.

447
00:18:52,485 --> 00:18:55,888
Although, the fact
that she wants to buy a loft

448
00:18:55,956 --> 00:18:58,724
could actually mean
that their relationship

449
00:18:58,792 --> 00:18:59,825
is not as serious
as I thought.

450
00:18:59,893 --> 00:19:01,594
Oh, for god's sake,
House,

451
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:02,761
don't do this to yourself.

452
00:19:02,829 --> 00:19:03,896
It's a loft.

453
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:05,264
It has no deeper meaning

454
00:19:05,332 --> 00:19:07,199
than open-space
living arrangement.

455
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:08,901
If you bought
into her diatribe

456
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:11,837
about rediscovering
her lost city girl roots.

457
00:19:11,905 --> 00:19:13,038
And two bedrooms.

458
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:14,139
It just reeks
of commitment issues.

459
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:17,843
Yeah. Or she has a baby.

460
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:20,346
This is classic
mid-life Cuddy crisis.

461
00:19:20,413 --> 00:19:22,081
This is her version
of a two-seat convertible.

462
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:25,017
Yeah, clearly you're fine
with it.

463
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:27,052
(Chase) Wilson,
he's got global lung damage.

464
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,622
Means it's not fungal.
It's PCP pneumonia.

465
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:35,895
Hmm.

466
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,631
Obviously something

467
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:41,100
is knocking out
his immune system.

468
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:45,337
Three options.
HIV. Acquired scid.

469
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:48,574
Or my personal favorite,
cancer.

470
00:19:48,642 --> 00:19:52,044
I'm sure you'll test
for all three.

471
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:01,720
62-year-old
african-american man

472
00:20:01,788 --> 00:20:03,722
with lymphoma
now in remission.

473
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,724
<i>I did a ct and found
a small lesion</i>

474
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:07,726
<i>on the upper lobe
of his left lung.</i>

475
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:09,328
If he's in remission,

476
00:20:09,396 --> 00:20:10,462
why did you bother
scanning him?

477
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,864
During a routine follow-up,

478
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:13,732
I realized the patient
was depressed.

479
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,435
Wow.
That's quite a call.

480
00:20:16,503 --> 00:20:19,371
Thanks.
The treatment indicate--

481
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:20,873
[door opens]

482
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:22,608
Oh, I'm sorry.

483
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:24,476
I didn't realize you were
in the middle of something.

484
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:27,146
It's a conference room

485
00:20:27,213 --> 00:20:28,914
with glass walls.

486
00:20:28,982 --> 00:20:30,683
You thought I'd be alone?

487
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,284
Your patient has cancer.

488
00:20:32,352 --> 00:20:34,353
Not that guy.

489
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:36,188
He probably also
has cancer.

490
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:37,489
And he's probably also
your buddy.

491
00:20:37,557 --> 00:20:40,326
Thought you'd want
to know.

492
00:20:40,393 --> 00:20:42,494
'Cause you owe me
100 bucks.

493
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:48,578
You have acute
lymphoblastic leukemia.

494
00:20:48,646 --> 00:20:49,713
A.L.L.

495
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:54,818
So it is
a recurrence.

496
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:57,220
No. It's different.
It's a second leukemia.

497
00:20:57,288 --> 00:20:58,889
Probably caused
by the chemotherapy

498
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:00,257
we gave him
five years ago.

499
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,092
That's why you didn't
see it.

500
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,428
Maybe they can rename it
ironic leukemia.

501
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:05,896
This is not the end.

502
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:08,298
Tests show that the cancer
is limited to your brain.

503
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,566
<i>That's good news.</i>

504
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:11,301
How can cancer in his head
be good news?

505
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:13,970
The blood brain barrier
separates

506
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:17,040
the blood in your head
from the blood in your body.

507
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:18,608
Keeps the cancer
bottled up.

508
00:21:18,676 --> 00:21:20,944
We can go for a cure.

509
00:21:21,012 --> 00:21:22,546
So give me the numbers.
What are we looking at?

510
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:23,947
90% chance of cure.

511
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:26,083
Really?

512
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,651
What if we're in the 10%?

513
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,052
Steady decline.

514
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,254
But six months
of a good quality life.

515
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:32,656
<i>(Emily)
does he have to go through</i>

516
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:34,624
another bone marrow transplant?
No.

517
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:35,826
Chemotherapy.

518
00:21:35,893 --> 00:21:36,927
We can go at this
with drugs alone.

519
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:39,730
When do we get started?

520
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:41,598
We begin by surgically
planting a shunt

521
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:43,400
so we can get the drugs
directly into your brain.

522
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,735
I already booked the O.R.

523
00:21:44,802 --> 00:21:46,670
you're the only one
who can make cancer

524
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,171
sound like good news.

525
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,873
We get it out of your head
and you walk out of here

526
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,141
paralysis gone
and cancer-free.

527
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:57,881
We also need you to sign
a health care proxy.

528
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,816
If something goes wrong
in surgery,

529
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:02,119
someone needs to be appointed
to make decisions for you.

530
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:03,553
What are the chances
of that happening?

531
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:05,021
Very remote.

532
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:07,157
I think maybe Melissa
should be my proxy.

533
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,692
What?
No.

534
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,994
(Foreman) coming through.
House got a new case.

535
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:16,433
Revised O.R. schedule.
Sorry, Wilson, had to bump you.

536
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,468
It's not like your guy's
bleeding out of his eyes.

537
00:22:18,536 --> 00:22:20,370
House, your guy's not bleeding
out of his eyes either.

538
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:22,072
The nurse who books the O.R.
thinks he is.

539
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,306
<i>Your case is no more urgent
than mine.</i>

540
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:25,842
Yeah, but you're way
more patient.

541
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:28,211
It's okay.

542
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,414
You can talk
about the--the paperwork

543
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:32,582
in the prep area.

544
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:36,987
You trust her more
than me.

545
00:22:37,054 --> 00:22:39,322
About this, yes.
[clears throat]

546
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,824
You've been through
the good stuff,

547
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:43,059
but Melissa's been
to hell and back with me.

548
00:22:43,127 --> 00:22:46,096
She gives me the best shot
of getting through this.

549
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:49,633
<i>You still love her.
Don't be silly.</i>

550
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,568
I love you.

551
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,336
<i>Please...</i>

552
00:22:53,404 --> 00:22:55,305
don't make this
into more than it is.

553
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:05,549
Okay, anything?
No.

554
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:08,018
Can you feel this?
No.

555
00:23:08,085 --> 00:23:10,687
How about here?
No.

556
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:13,757
Where is everybody?

557
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,659
Melissa and Emily
went downstairs

558
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:16,993
to get some breakfast.
Ashley?

559
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:18,895
She had work to do.

560
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:20,430
I thought she was off today.

561
00:23:20,498 --> 00:23:22,132
Well, she didn't really
have work to do.

562
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
She was just pissed

563
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,734
so she pretended
to have work to do.

564
00:23:24,802 --> 00:23:26,336
I let her pretend.

565
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:29,906
Okay.

566
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:31,808
Move your fingers.

567
00:23:38,616 --> 00:23:39,783
The chemo's not working.

568
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,985
Does that mean
it's not cancer?

569
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,221
No. It means the chemo

570
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:45,589
from your first round
of treatment

571
00:23:45,656 --> 00:23:47,324
has made the leukemia
resistant.

572
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:50,727
So I'm in the 10%
that don't get cured.

573
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:57,067
Maybe not.

574
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:59,903
We just removed a screw
from a guy's lung.

575
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,572
And the weird thing is
he didn't get better.

576
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,840
Any idea what that means?

577
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:05,642
It means
you're not listening to me.

578
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,377
No. It means I'm ignoring you
to make a point.

579
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,478
There is a difference.

580
00:24:08,546 --> 00:24:09,813
The problem
with that technique

581
00:24:09,881 --> 00:24:11,548
is I have no idea
what point you're making.

582
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:14,651
That your idea is implicitly
not worth responding to.

583
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:18,054
Doubling your patient's
chemo dose is stupid.

584
00:24:18,122 --> 00:24:19,689
Damn. Now it's explicit.

585
00:24:19,757 --> 00:24:21,057
It could swamp out
the resistance

586
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,325
of the cancer cells.

587
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:23,894
The fact that it
theoretically should work

588
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,295
doesn't make it
any less stupid.

589
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:27,597
Of course it does.
It's exactly what you would do.

590
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:29,533
I'm me. You're you.

591
00:24:32,036 --> 00:24:34,604
And a table is a table.

592
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:36,806
And chemo is poison.

593
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:39,276
And double chemo
is double poison.

594
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:41,511
I can handle it
when things go wrong.

595
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:43,747
You can't.

596
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:46,049
And things could go very,
very wrong.

597
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:50,120
I can handle it.

598
00:24:56,961 --> 00:24:59,262
Sounds pretty dangerous.

599
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:02,432
It is.

600
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,533
What do you think, Mel?

601
00:25:07,371 --> 00:25:08,672
I think
you should call Ashley.

602
00:25:11,008 --> 00:25:13,043
You're my family.

603
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:16,580
I'm sorry I forgot that.

604
00:25:20,484 --> 00:25:22,986
I think
that you should try

605
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,821
whatever could keep you
with us longer.

606
00:25:26,557 --> 00:25:28,792
Yeah.

607
00:25:50,314 --> 00:25:55,852
[chattering and laughter]

608
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,454
Look.

609
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,888
I can move them.

610
00:25:58,956 --> 00:26:01,658
Hey! Thank you.
[laughs]

611
00:26:03,526 --> 00:26:05,693
What is it, Jim?

612
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:09,330
I'm gonna need to run
some tests.

613
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,768
Intraepidermal
superficial bullae.

614
00:26:11,835 --> 00:26:13,669
Could be pemphigus.
Or it could be from the fire.

615
00:26:13,737 --> 00:26:15,638
<i>Either way, he's dead.</i>

616
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:17,740
We can't stop
the oozing.

617
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:20,777
Don't care.

618
00:26:20,844 --> 00:26:23,980
I'm here because it's 1:15

619
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:26,315
and Wilson started testing
at 12:45.

620
00:26:26,383 --> 00:26:30,086
Which means...
the cancer's gone.

621
00:26:30,154 --> 00:26:31,888
But over half his hepatocytes
are dead.

622
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:35,158
In only 24 hours?

623
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:38,594
He needs a new liver.

624
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:43,900
Look on the bright side.

625
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:46,636
<i>You can publish the results
of this case study.</i>

626
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:48,671
No one will ever double
the dose again.

627
00:26:53,354 --> 00:26:55,188
The double dose of chemo
got rid of your cancer.

628
00:26:55,256 --> 00:26:59,026
But it also trashed
your liver.

629
00:26:59,093 --> 00:27:02,129
If I don't find you
a new liver,

630
00:27:02,196 --> 00:27:04,564
you've only got
about 24 hours left.

631
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:08,669
So what do we do now?

632
00:27:08,736 --> 00:27:11,872
Your father's been moved
to the top

633
00:27:11,939 --> 00:27:13,507
of the transplant list.

634
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:16,410
But all we really
can do is wait.

635
00:27:16,477 --> 00:27:17,544
That's it? We wait?

636
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:18,612
Tell me something
that I can do.

637
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,180
I'm sorry, Mel.

638
00:27:20,248 --> 00:27:22,416
You and Emily don't match
Tuck's blood type.

639
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:25,018
And neither does Ashley.

640
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:27,888
So a live liver donation
is out.

641
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:31,825
The best thing to do
is just what you've been doing.

642
00:27:31,893 --> 00:27:34,761
Be together.

643
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,034
Hope he already told you
that you're gonna die.

644
00:27:41,502 --> 00:27:42,168
'Cause it's gonna make

645
00:27:42,236 --> 00:27:44,538
what I'm about to say
a lot more relevant.

646
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:46,439
House, I know it's raining
out there in the hallway,

647
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:49,910
but--
I was just in the ER testing my patient

648
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:51,378
for autonomic dysfunction.

649
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:53,413
It's the only department
with a shower big enough

650
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:55,248
for the whole team,
plus the cardiac monitors,

651
00:27:55,316 --> 00:27:56,816
plus me.

652
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:58,285
Anyway, relevant part,

653
00:27:58,352 --> 00:27:59,553
we're just wheeling
the guy out,

654
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,820
trauma came in.

655
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,188
Motorcycle versus semi.

656
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:04,357
How bad?
Bad for the motorcycle.

657
00:28:04,425 --> 00:28:05,659
Good for your liver.

658
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,693
<i>Blood type's a match.</i>

659
00:28:06,761 --> 00:28:07,694
Why wasn't I paged?

660
00:28:07,762 --> 00:28:09,529
Because there's a problem.

661
00:28:09,597 --> 00:28:10,964
No organ donor card.

662
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:12,566
<i>Dead guy's sister
is next of kin.</i>

663
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:14,367
She's refusing to allow
the donation.

664
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:16,469
Where is she?
20 minutes away.

665
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:22,275
How do you get the call
that your brother's dead

666
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:23,710
and then run out the door?

667
00:28:23,778 --> 00:28:25,545
"Oh--oh--oh,
that reminds me,

668
00:28:25,613 --> 00:28:28,982
i-I had dry cleaning
to pick up."

669
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,850
Did Cuddy buy the place?

670
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,987
Not yet. You okay?

671
00:28:34,055 --> 00:28:36,323
Just making conversation.

672
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,624
Yours was getting boring.

673
00:28:37,692 --> 00:28:39,326
What are you planning?

674
00:28:39,393 --> 00:28:40,594
I'm not planning anything.

675
00:28:40,661 --> 00:28:41,995
And I don't believe you.

676
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:43,630
How are you gonna punish her
for dating Lucas?

677
00:28:43,698 --> 00:28:46,967
Okay, now this conversation
is getting boring.

678
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:51,504
Are you really okay?
No!

679
00:28:51,572 --> 00:28:54,441
I am not okay.
Not even close.

680
00:28:54,508 --> 00:29:00,213
Wow. Okay.
See, that's very adult of you.

681
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,314
No, it isn't.

682
00:29:02,683 --> 00:29:03,950
It's just me accepting
the fact

683
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:05,885
that there's nothing I can do
and moving on.

684
00:29:05,953 --> 00:29:08,922
Which is, I think,
the definition of adulthood.

685
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,257
Well, if it is,
being a kid is a lot more fun.

686
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:14,160
Showtime.

687
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:25,438
I didn't speak to him
for years.

688
00:29:25,506 --> 00:29:28,074
But when my parents died,

689
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,776
at their funeral,

690
00:29:29,844 --> 00:29:33,013
we made peace.

691
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,081
Our parents
must've blessed it.

692
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:38,785
And I'm sure they would
want him to do good

693
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:40,353
with his last act
in this world.

694
00:29:40,421 --> 00:29:43,857
They wanted us
to be friends.

695
00:29:43,924 --> 00:29:45,692
<i>Our relationship
wasn't strong,</i>

696
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,294
<i>but it was growing.</i>

697
00:29:48,362 --> 00:29:50,530
If I allow you
to defile his body,

698
00:29:50,598 --> 00:29:52,699
<i>it will destroy
that bond.</i>

699
00:29:52,767 --> 00:29:54,768
<i>The itai will be harmed.</i>

700
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:57,303
It will save
my patient's life.

701
00:30:02,443 --> 00:30:06,446
What if I told you
that he wasn't dead?

702
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:09,149
Are you saying my brother
is still alive?

703
00:30:09,216 --> 00:30:11,217
I'm saying you're being
an idiot.

704
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:12,452
<i>But I don't have time
to talk you out</i>

705
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,753
<i>of your religion</i>

706
00:30:13,821 --> 00:30:15,822
so I'm stuck with giving you
a technicality

707
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,924
<i>that will let you justify

You're my friend.

Of course not.
Fine then. You're fired.

why shouldn't I do everything

817

Because you're a doctor,
not a donor. [laughs]

00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,021
Cuddy won't share
that sentiment.

886
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:41,358
How are you going
to explain it to her?

887
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,860
I'm changing our address
to a P.O. box.

888
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:45,896
She'll find out
eventually.

889
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,932
A problem delayed

890
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,134
is a problem denied.

891
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:57,240
Bonnie. I'll take it.

892
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,176
Baby steps.
