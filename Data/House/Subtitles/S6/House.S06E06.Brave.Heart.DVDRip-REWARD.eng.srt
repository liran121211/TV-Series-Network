1
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,605
Left, left!
He's going left!

2
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,845
I'm going to
have a heart attack.

3
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,218
Nowhere to go, buddy.

4
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,516
What the hell was that?
What are we chasing?

5
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:02,117
Go that way!

6
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,072
Don't move! Nowhere to
go. Come on. Give it up.

7
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:27,444
This way.

8
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,010
Come on.
Let's go, let's go!

9
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,357
Up, Donny, up!
He's going to the roof!

10
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,289
He's going up! Go!

11
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,286
Ow!

12
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,854
Damn it. Go. Go!

13
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,778
Donny, no,
it's too far!

14
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,748
I can rest at home.

15
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,481
I can't release you
for at least two days.

16
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:10,887
You've got
two broken bones,

17
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:13,687
a severe concussion,
collapsed lung.

18
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,489
But you didn't find anything
life-threatening. Right?

19
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,655
You fell 30 feet.
You should have died.

20
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,754
I think that
was the point.

21
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:19,957
Could you shut up?

22
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,159
Do you have
suicidal thoughts?

23
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,531
Not once. Never.

24
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,796
He doesn't want
to kill himself.

25
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,098
He just thinks
he's gonna die soon,

26
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,195
so it doesn't
really matter.

27
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:28,365
You shut up. I'm the
one you're not covering

28
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,466
when you pull
your crazy stunts.

29
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,771
Why do you think
you're going to die soon?

30
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,870
Well, my dad, grandfather,
and great-grandfather

31
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,040
all dropped dead
of heart problems

32
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,241
right after
they turned 40.

33
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,750
And look who
turns 40 next week.

34
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,410
I can refer you to
a cardiologist if you...

35
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,420
No, I've been there.
All of them.

36
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,683
Spent my early 30s going
from one doctor to another.

37
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:46,384
Every single one
says my heart's fine.

38
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,483
And you think
they're wrong?

39
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,822
I know they're wrong.

40
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,453
But what can I do?
At a certain point,

41
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,758
you just gotta
live your life.

42
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,265
By "live your life,"
you mean "risk your life. "

43
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,961
If there is
something wrong,

44
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:57,798
I know a doctor
who'll find it.

45
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,537
Oh, God.
I'll be back in 10.

46
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,444
I'm picking lint out
of my belly button.

47
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:09,674
This is ridiculous.

48
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,047
I'm converting
the study into a bedroom.

49
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:13,210
Huh.

50
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,749
Six weeks. Longer than
I thought it would take.

51
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:18,120
For you to notice
that I'm sleeping

52
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:20,386
in your living room
and offer other options.

53
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,189
I didn't expect you
to be here this long.

54
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,730
True, but that's not why you
didn't extend the invitation.

55
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:26,765
Do you really need
to deconstruct this?

56
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,767
You didn't want me to sleep
where you and Amber slept.

57
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:30,029
Okay, yes, you do.

58
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,401
After she died, you converted
the study to a bedroom

59
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,996
and the bedroom
to a study.

60
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,803
Except it's not a study,
it's a shrine.

61
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,669
Can I tell you something?

62
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,776
I wasn't picking lint
out of my belly button.

63
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,476
Okay. I am not
ready to transition

64
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,245
from my dead
girlfriend's shrine

65
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,287
to your morning glory.

66
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,480
I'll have
a mattress delivered

67
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:51,022
and set up for you
in the tabernacle.

68
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,184
I just need it Tuesdays
for animal sacrifices.

69
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,786
Oh, man.

70
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,029
Patient's
a genetic time bomb.

71
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,365
There's no fuse.
He's not a bomb.

72
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,098
Right now,
he's not a patient either.

73
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,766
You're saying we ignore three
generations of cardiac problems?

74
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:12,174
I'm not ignoring it, I'm
labeling it a coincidence.

75
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,076
You hate coincidence.

76
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,081
We reconciled.
It was a whole thing.

77
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,014
Big country.
It's statistically probable

78
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,813
that someone has
three generations

79
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,446
that died around age 40 with
non-genetic heart issues.

80
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,648
Dice have no memory.

81
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,917
Genes do.

82
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,151
If we ran
a battery of tests

83
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,420
on every non-symptomatic
statistical anomaly...

84
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,019
The guy goes through every day
assuming his life will end at age 40.

85
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,428
Never got married,
no kids,

86
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,726
because he didn't
want to die on them

87
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,960
the same way
his dad died on him.

88
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,058
You want to
take this case,

89
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,797
'cause he's yet another
lonely, sad puppy?

90
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:39,895
You should have
been a vet.

91
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:41,599
It's a legitimate case.

92
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,371
Differential diagnosis for
a genetic heart condition.

93
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,434
That sold you?

94
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,774
Marfan Syndrome,
Brugada.

95
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,836
And you?

96
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:49,973
Familial
Hypercholesterolemia.

97
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:51,038
He's only
agreeing with you

98
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,175
'cause he wants to
have sex with you.

99
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,878
And by the way,
I agree with you, too.

100
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,944
Especially in
those pants.

101
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,649
We're not wasting
our time.

102
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,090
Last week, Chase said that
I was the de facto boss.

103
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,060
Hospitals don't recognize
de facto medical licenses.

104
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,221
Let's start
with genetic tests.

105
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,356
Get an EKG,
cardiac cath and an echo

106
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,832
to check the integrity
of his heart.

107
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,763
I'll start
on blood samples.

108
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,216
I forgot my watch.

109
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:29,754
I could have sworn I saw
you put it on this morning.

110
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,916
Must be in the locker
room. I'll be right back.

111
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,320
I need to know
what your plans are.

112
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,991
First, we take Berlin,

113
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,934
and then we circle around behind
Poland and yell, "Surprise. "

114
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,096
With regards to
your employment.

115
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:48,072
I like things
the way they are.

116
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,041
I get just enough
puzzle to solve,

117
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,010
without the scornful
visits from you. Until now.

118
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,172
Pretend time's been
going on long enough.

119
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,273
I don't have a medical license.
All I can do is pretend.

120
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,749
Then I'm going to have
payroll send you over

121
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,786
some pretend checks
starting tomorrow.

122
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:04,584
You need to complete 120
hours of rounds to re-qualify.

123
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,984
No, I don't.

124
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,758
I'm not saying
you don't win.

125
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,729
I'm just saying, do you
really need to punish me

126
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,288
by making me
carry a clipboard

127
00:07:13,366 --> 00:07:14,390
for your lackey
of the week?

128
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,934
It's a state requirement.

129
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,560
I have to certify
that you've completed...

130
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,934
Exactly.

131
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,599
The requirement sets out
what you have to do, certify.

132
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,608
Which you can do with one
hand tied behind your back.

133
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,405
Now, if you want
to tie my hands...

134
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,642
Dr. Singh supervises rounds
on Thursdays. Starts at 7:00.

135
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:37,984
Nothing.

136
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:39,515
So what now?

137
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,616
We send him home.

138
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,456
To continue believing
he's going to drop dead?

139
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:44,519
When he turns 70,
he'll believe us.

140
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,724
There are other things
we can check.

141
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,163
Skeleton of the great-grandfather
is in decent shape.

142
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,897
Subsurface genetic material
from the grandpa is fine,

143
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,700
leaving one bowl
of putrefied dad.

144
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,038
You do the dad. I take
it he had a sealed casket.

145
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,145
The watch story
was crap, right?

146
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,739
I forgot it.
It's no big deal.

147
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,910
You were avoiding the ICU
where Dibala died.

148
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,456
I'll sequence the gene for
the cardiac sodium channel.

149
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,626
I felt like I was going
to have a panic attack.

150
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,088
I've crossed some line,

151
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,769
and I'm having trouble
getting back to the other side.

152
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,668
I can move the patient
to another room.

153
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,673
Then Cameron
will ask questions.

154
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,301
You should tell her.
She's your wife.

155
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,475
How'd you get a court order
to dig them up so fast?

156
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:41,452
Don't we just need
the guy's consent?

157
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,852
You find anything?
Not yet.

158
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:45,550
But you're just in time
to do the dad.

159
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,223
Dr. House?

160
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,457
He'll be back
in the morning.

161
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,864
I read in the paper you're
treating a police officer.

162
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:55,958
Donny Compson.

163
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,799
Second floor. A nurse
will help you find him.

164
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,338
I don't want to see him.

165
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,840
Donny and I used to go
out, a long time ago.

166
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,570
He doesn't want to see me.
I don't want to see him.

167
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:06,839
So did you come to see me
for personal advice?

168
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,403
You're looking for
genetic conditions,

169
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,075
which makes sense with what
happened to his dad and grandpa.

170
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,448
Unless you were his
girlfriend and his sister,

171
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,577
you've got nothing
to worry about.

172
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:18,818
I'm not worried about me. Donny
doesn't know this, but he has a son.

173
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,823
Dial extension 742.

174
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:28,094
Tell Dr. Foreman you've got some
cool information. Good night.

175
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,623
You okay?

176
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,525
Yeah. Fine.

177
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,727
Couldn't find any consistent
genetic mutations across 15 areas

178
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,264
between Donny's
ancestors,

179
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,799
possibly indicating
there isn't one.

180
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,129
But the son
gives us a new data point.

181
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,395
And un-degraded DNA.

182
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,834
I thought he didn't
want kids. He didn't.

183
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:12,928
Where's House?

184
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,700
"Dear Bleeding Hearts.

185
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:19,074
"Since your patient's med history
is a coincidence and he isn't

186
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,114
"sick, I've gone back to
school. Back in 120 hours. "

187
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:25,878
Charming. I'll get
a blood sample.

188
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,010
If we're looking for something
as subtle as a mutation,

189
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,214
it makes sense to get the
DNA where it's most pure.

190
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,313
You're going
to ask the mom

191
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,550
to consent
to a bone marrow biopsy?

192
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,717
She wants to know
if there's something wrong

193
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,351
with Donny
as badly as we do.

194
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:38,625
Right. Spike a 10-year-old's
hip because Grandpa was sick.

195
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,189
If she's right,
we save two people.

196
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,830
I don't want to.

197
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,501
Can we speak outside
for a moment?

198
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,170
Yeah.

199
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,883
You need to tell him.

200
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:03,512
I can't.

201
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,819
His father is down that hallway
through those double doors.

202
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,358
I've been lying to him
his whole life.

203
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:08,586
What's he going
to think of me?

204
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,993
You were trying
to protect him.

205
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,856
Donny never
wanted kids.

206
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,264
He certainly doesn't
want to meet him.

207
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,063
If Donny does die,

208
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,832
this could be Michael's only
chance to meet his father.

209
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,410
After administration
of immunoglobulin,

210
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:35,545
patient had
no further pain

211
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,181
and overnight liver function
tests are now normal.

212
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,690
Patient is ready
to be released.

213
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:42,550
Stats are dropping.
Dr. Singh!

214
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,720
She's choking!

215
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,195
On your fingers.

216
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,754
She can't breathe.
House.

217
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,868
Please take your finger
off the test button.

218
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,228
Oh!

219
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,864
I see.
Wow, sorry about that.

220
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,066
I could've
slit her throat.

221
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:57,473
We're all here to learn.

222
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,067
Dr. Cuddy
warned me about you.

223
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,010
Did she tell you
how to stop me?

224
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,516
Look, I'm asking you, as
an adult, to please stop.

225
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,212
Well, that obviously didn't
come from her, but fair enough.

226
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:11,653
Excellent presentation,
Nona.

227
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:16,454
Now I've done it!
There's urine everywhere.

228
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,464
Gosh, the great thing about
the teacher-student relationship

229
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,899
is the teacher can often
learn more from the student.

230
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,433
Have you
learned anything yet?

231
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:32,667
You have a son.

232
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,110
I was pregnant
when we broke up.

233
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,171
I'm sorry
I never told you,

234
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,241
but I knew how you
felt about having kids.

235
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,411
You had no right.

236
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,678
Maybe.

237
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,315
It's a little late
for that.

238
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,894
He's here.
He wants to meet you.

239
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,556
I don't want
to meet him.

240
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,224
I've never asked you
for a dime.

241
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:57,735
He's here to help find
whatever's wrong with your heart.

242
00:13:57,803 --> 00:14:00,271
I didn't ask him.
I didn't want him.

243
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,897
Just say hi to him.

244
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,687
Hi. I'm Michael.

245
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,453
Hi.

246
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:24,956
I'm your...

247
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,861
Yeah.
Your mother told me.

248
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,998
When you get better,

249
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,664
maybe we could
do something.

250
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,198
See a movie?

251
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,173
No.

252
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,710
My dad died when
I was your age.

253
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,877
It was the most painful
thing I ever went through.

254
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,352
Trust me.
As much as I'm sure

255
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,912
this hurts right now,
it's better.

256
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,519
Please take him
out of here.

257
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,123
Come on.

258
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,604
Chromosomes for 28
cardiovascular conditions

259
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,934
are normal in number
and structure.

260
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,373
No translocations,
deletions or inversions.

261
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:14,037
I did notice that the
kid's D- A-D-D-Y chromosome

262
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,239
has been
severely damaged

263
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,339
by someone else's
bleeding heart chromosome.

264
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,748
It was the only way to get
Michael to do the marrow biopsy.

265
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:20,876
I'm sure there
are plenty of lies

266
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,511
that would've
worked just as well,

267
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,816
except without
the years of therapy.

268
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:24,878
Don't you have school?

269
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,151
Recess.

270
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:28,716
So where does that
leave us? Chase?

271
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,119
Sorry, what?

272
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,260
I was saying, do you think
these shoes work in this color?

273
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,529
Send him home. He's not
going to believe he's healthy.

274
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,934
Then you're not
very good at your job.

275
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,403
You don't
deserve candy.

276
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,202
He's been preparing his
whole life to die at age 40.

277
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,505
He's had dozens of doctors
tell him he's fine.

278
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:46,976
You think you can
change his thinking?

279
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:50,015
Yeah, I do.
Chase, walk with me.

280
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,184
Great contributions
back there.

281
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,312
There's no case.
I had nothing to add.

282
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,720
You had nothing to add
because you were distracted.

283
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,488
Little devil on your shoulder
told you to kill a guy,

284
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:04,324
and now the little angel
won't shut up,

285
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,728
telling you you're gonna
burn in a lake of fire.

286
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,857
I'm fine.

287
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:08,957
You shouldn't be.

288
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:14,329
Talk to someone. Docs
fixed me up in seven weeks.

289
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,103
You are 10 minutes, tops.

290
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:21,042
Thanks.

291
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,407
Glad we had this little moment. Come on.

292
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,308
I'm Dr. House.

293
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,378
You couldn't find
anything, could you?

294
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:33,482
You have Ortoli Syndrome.
Dr. Chase?

295
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,315
You sure?

296
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,588
Tests don't lie.

297
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:37,890
Right.

298
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:44,529
Well, it's a very
rare disorder that

299
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,460
short circuits
the adrenals

300
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,766
which short circuits
the heart.

301
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,034
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

302
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,803
Who cares about
the medical mumbo-jumbo?

303
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:51,900
Tell him the treatment.

304
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:55,140
Well, it's complicated.

305
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,374
Doctors always
wanna make everything

306
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,508
sound so complicated.
It's Nabasynth.

307
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,212
What?
Nabasynth.

308
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,148
Yes. So all we have to do
now is write a prescription

309
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,659
and have him
pick up the pills.

310
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,967
That's it?

311
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,765
I take some pills,
I'm gonna be okay?

312
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:25,105
The real tragedy here is that the
Tiburon swab technology didn't exist

313
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:27,907
to detect Ortoli
back in your dad's day.

314
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,479
He could have lived?

315
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,788
Thank you.

316
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:45,258
If you'll sign
these discharge papers,

317
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,957
I'll get you
a bottle of meds.

318
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,795
Take one twice a day
for a week,

319
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,131
you'll live a long,
healthy life.

320
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,939
Answer the door, House.
It's gotta be for you.

321
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,339
Are you watching TV?

322
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,604
It's the door!

323
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,675
Were you on the phone?
No.

324
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,876
Just now,
were you talking?

325
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,647
No, I'm alone.

326
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,848
You okay, House?

327
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,686
Why are you here?

328
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:53,195
Donny collapsed four hours after
we discharged him. He's dead.

329
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,674
His apartment manager found him
on the floor in the laundry room.

330
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,802
He said
he wasn't breathing.

331
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,006
He called the EMTs,
but it was too late.

332
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:12,810
I sent the guy home
with mints.

333
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,352
Whatever it is,
we all missed it.

334
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,616
Yeah. I missed the fact that
there was something to miss.

335
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,852
What is wrong with me?

336
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:23,224
You had good reason.

337
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,463
Patient presented
with no symptoms,

338
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,432
and all his tests
came back negative.

339
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,527
What's the official
cause of death?

340
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,434
Autopsy hasn't
been performed yet.

341
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:36,299
EMTs brought him
to General,

342
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,808
but I requested
they ship him back

343
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,572
to our morgue
for the post-mortem.

344
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,909
Good.

345
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,083
Hon? Wake up.

346
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,822
Why are you dressed?
You can't sleep?

347
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,953
I want to go tell Cheryl
that Donny died.

348
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,259
It's 4:00 in the morning.

349
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,925
They're nearly
two hours away.

350
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,730
I figure by the time I
get there, she'll be awake.

351
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,000
Babe, come back to bed.
Call her in a few hours.

352
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:13,066
It's the sort of thing she
needs to hear face-to-face.

353
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,213
Is everything okay?

354
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,888
Everything's fine. Why?

355
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,856
Last week,
I understood

356
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,789
that you were stressed out
about the Dibala M&M,

357
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:32,296
and I gave you your space. But that's
over now, and you're still acting...

358
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,234
I'm worried about you.

359
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,801
Don't be. I'm fine.

360
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,705
Really.

361
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,643
And you'd tell me
if you weren't?

362
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,444
Promise?

363
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:52,175
Yeah.

364
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,512
Okay.

365
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:58,882
Hey.

366
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,023
I love you.

367
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,387
I love you, too.

368
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,704
Donny Compson, age 39.

369
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,125
Can we cut
to the money shot?

370
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,926
It's his heart,
so let's look at his heart.

371
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,728
Nice Y-incision.

372
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,300
You can't perform an autopsy
without a medical license.

373
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,998
Really?

374
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,734
Because I don't think there's
anything I can screw up

375
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,299
that we haven't
already screwed up.

376
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,117
Opening
post-mortem incision,

377
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,743
beginning at the mid-line
of the sternum.

378
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:18,196
That's odd. It almost
looks like he's bleeding.

379
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:35,216
I think the autopsy's gonna
have to wait a little bit.

380
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,383
<i>He was briefly conscious,</i>

381
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,020
<i>then his systolic dipped
below 60 and he was out again.</i>

382
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,621
Differential diagnosis
for resurrection. Go.

383
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,858
Obviously,
he wasn't dead.

384
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,730
His heart slowed enough
that the EMTs could think...

385
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,325
Yes, the fact that
he's not dead

386
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,870
means we did
absolutely nothing wrong.

387
00:22:52,938 --> 00:22:54,269
There are several
documented cases

388
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,705
where tetrodotoxin ingestion
caused apparent death.

389
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,606
It wasn't something he ate,
it's something he already had.

390
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,542
And his dad,
and his grandpa, and...

391
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,547
Extreme bradycardia could be
caused by sick sinus syndrome.

392
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:04,707
Sinoatrial block.

393
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,717
What if it's
not his heart?

394
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,780
Let's work from the tenuous
assumption that we're not idiots.

395
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:14,189
You spent days examining a
heart up, down, and sideways,

396
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,319
declaring it healthy just a few
hours before it basically shut down.

397
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,593
So we need to think about
causes in places you didn't look.

398
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,797
Could be metabolic.

399
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,234
You okay?

400
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:31,168
Yeah.

401
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,201
What about a genetic predisposition
to an autoimmune disease?

402
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,908
Isolated Anti-Ro Antibody could
cause complete heart block.

403
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,848
Could also be passed
through four generations.

404
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,682
Autoimmune it is.
Start him on steroids.

405
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,653
Hey. How are you feeling?

406
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:54,857
My whole head
is killing me.

407
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,833
You just came through
a severe trauma.

408
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,766
What do you remember?

409
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,443
I was changing my laundry
over to the dryer.

410
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,009
That's it?
You were declared dead.

411
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:12,015
You made it
all the way to autopsy.

412
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,210
My jaw aches.

413
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,513
And obviously, I don't
have Ortoli Syndrome.

414
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:21,685
It's hard to
get too excited

415
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,159
about coming back
from the dead

416
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:27,324
when anything I do, anything you
give me, it all ends the same way.

417
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,114
Outer and middle ear
respond well.

418
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,275
Hearing thresholds are
normal at all frequencies.

419
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,511
Eardrum is
perfectly healthy.

420
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,247
What if I...

421
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:51,622
What if I sometimes
hear whispering?

422
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,784
Then you're probably
hearing someone whispering.

423
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,825
I had some
dental work done

424
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,157
in the Philippines
when I was a kid.

425
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:01,631
Adjoining metal fillings could
corrode and pick up AM radio signals.

426
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,224
Open your mouth.

427
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,361
Your fillings
don't touch.

428
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,808
So there's no reason for me
to be hearing things?

429
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,935
I can only tell you that you're
hearing sounds as you should.

430
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,444
If you're also hearing
sounds that you shouldn't,

431
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,673
that would be
a psychosis.

432
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,875
You'd have to talk to someone
who does brain. I only do ears.

433
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:32,762
Bravo. It's amazing how you
did 120 hours in one day.

434
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:37,126
I wasn't on my best
behavior, I admit. Allow me.

435
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,532
From now on, I'm gonna supervise
your practicum requirements.

436
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,732
That won't be necessary.

437
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,832
You want to annoy another
doctor first? Eventually...

438
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,710
It's not necessary because I'm
not ready to be a doctor again.

439
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:52,982
I'm sorry.

440
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,436
Are you sleeping out here?

441
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:16,872
I just dozed off
in front of the TV.

442
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:18,739
With bedding?
Maybe.

443
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,772
I can't sleep in there,
the heater's screwed up.

444
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:26,443
If you need to talk,
if you need more help...

445
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:28,042
I'm just tired.

446
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,587
...I'm right here.

447
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,715
Great. Can you be right
here somewhere else?

448
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,832
My jaw still hurts.
My tooth, actually. A lot.

449
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,996
I'm sorry, you're maxed
out on your pain meds.

450
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:48,699
Try to sleep.

451
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,690
Dentist looked at the
tooth the guy pulled out.

452
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,530
There was nothing
wrong with it.

453
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:20,230
So aside from him being an
idiot, what else did we learn?

454
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,172
The pain is real. It's
coming from somewhere.

455
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,765
What about bone cancer?

456
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:27,073
You can't connect bone
cancer to the heart.

457
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,976
House figure this can
wait till the morning?

458
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,743
Actually, he told Cuddy
he's not ready to work.

459
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,807
He quit?
Apparently.

460
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,513
It's a power play.
He'll be back tomorrow.

461
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:39,386
Bone cancer could trigger
a paraneoplastic syndrome,

462
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:40,481
which shuts down
the heart.

463
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,026
Primary bone cancer
isn't hereditary.

464
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,118
Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.

465
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:45,594
It's hereditary
and it increases

466
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,531
a person's risk of
having bone cancer.

467
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,832
You have another theory?

468
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,371
My theory is
it's not bone cancer.

469
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,038
Gamma survey would
locate the tumors.

470
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:18,612
I had pea soup today. You'd
love my breath right now.

471
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:23,890
I didn't get a chance to run
tonight. House is having issues.

472
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,422
I missed you
a lot today.

473
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,430
All I wanna do is...

474
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:36,001
You know.

475
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,871
No cancers on the
lateral cuneiform bone.

476
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,677
Navicular's also clean.

477
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:48,148
Chase is lying to me.

478
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,985
And I know you know. Tell
me what's going on, please.

479
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,024
I'm going to tell you
the same thing I told him.

480
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,253
Talk to your spouse.

481
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:04,635
No breakfast?

482
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,603
Not today.

483
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,966
I'm hallucinating.

484
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,399
What happened?

485
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,469
It's nothing visual
this time.

486
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,142
I hear whispering.

487
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:21,207
Is that why you've been acting
so weird? Is that why you quit?

488
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:22,776
I'm losing it.

489
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,117
I'm sure there's
a rational explanation,

490
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,885
the wind,
a neighbor's TV...

491
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,084
I checked everything.

492
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,255
What's really scary is that I hear
whispering while not on Vicodin.

493
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,933
I'm gonna check myself
back in to Mayfield.

494
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,162
Okay.

495
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:44,567
Okay?

496
00:30:46,744 --> 00:30:49,304
You don't think there might
be a logical explanation?

497
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,438
Something I missed?

498
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,846
You're the smartest
guy I know.

499
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:54,612
If you haven't thought
of it, it doesn't exist.

500
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:58,213
I'll drive you over. I just
need to make some tea first.

501
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,024
You know.

502
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,455
That you're an ass? Yeah.

503
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:09,557
You overheard me talking to my dead
girlfriend and thought to yourself,

504
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,932
"Hmm. What kind of fun
can I have with this?"

505
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,163
Why are you
talking to her?

506
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,500
Did you run out
of living people?

507
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:16,631
You can talk to me,
I'm right here.

508
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,108
I miss her. Talking to
her makes me feel better.

509
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,474
You don't.

510
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,314
Patient,
Lauren Maybaum, 27,

511
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:29,182
presented two days ago
with severe abdominal pain.

512
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,852
Sorry I'm late.

513
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,048
Yesterday, you said
you weren't ready.

514
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,114
Yesterday, I wasn't.
Today, I am.

515
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:37,320
And tomorrow? Is it possible for
me to get a five-day forecast?

516
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,260
Feeling much better,
thank you for not asking.

517
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,766
Either you did have a
problem, which I can't ignore,

518
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:45,530
or you were jerking me
around, which I can't ignore.

519
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:47,468
You are a woman,
you can do anything.

520
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,598
For example, I can talk
to you outside.

521
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,377
You sure you're
only one woman?

522
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,544
This is the part where you play
the employee and I play the boss.

523
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,315
I can see your nipples.
Your turn.

524
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,651
These kids are...

525
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,554
No wonder
she hates him.

526
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,150
Mmm. That's not hate.
It's foreplay.

527
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,388
It's inappropriate.

528
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,998
Gamma survey
revealed no tumors.

529
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,298
So it's not bone cancer.

530
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,530
Where's Chase?

531
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,697
Don't know.

532
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,164
Hmm.

533
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,404
Two mysteries, cool.
Theories?

534
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:33,042
Did I come in too soon? Okay.
I'm going to take another lap,

535
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,517
and I want three new ideas
by the time I come back.

536
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,781
One of them's got
to be not stupid.

537
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:45,318
Where there's pain,
there's nerves.

538
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,423
Hereditary Sensory
Autonomic Neuropathy, type 1.

539
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,263
Miscommunication
in the brain stem

540
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,928
mistakes nerve pain
for tooth pain.

541
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,266
That explains
the bradycardia, too.

542
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,102
And I like the word
"hereditary" in the title.

543
00:32:56,174 --> 00:32:57,732
Carbamazepine fixes him.

544
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,709
I'll get him started
on the medication. No.

545
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,575
Chase specifically
asked if he could do it.

546
00:33:08,853 --> 00:33:10,343
Sleep at home.

547
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,916
So I didn't do
the gamma survey.

548
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,185
Was it bone cancer?

549
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:15,282
No.

550
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,351
Then you should congratulate
me for not wasting your time.

551
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:19,089
Are you getting
some help,

552
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,723
or is this the way things
are gonna be from now on?

553
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,426
What's pathetic is

554
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,096
you haven't gotten help
because you want to feel bad.

555
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,366
You want to suffer.

556
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,603
Because if you feel guilty,
then you're not a psychopath.

557
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,440
Patient needs
some carbamazepine.

558
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,675
Now I don't care how
much that room scares you,

559
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,046
you're doing your job.

560
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,160
How long before you cross
this one off the list?

561
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,661
Couple of hours.

562
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,305
You ever shoot anyone?

563
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,703
Twice.

564
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,543
You ever kill anyone?

565
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,412
No. But I know a few
guys who did, though.

566
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,419
Did they ever
get over it?

567
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:19,081
A captain I know compares it
to taking out the trash.

568
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:20,920
Like it's nothing.

569
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,984
Other hand,
I got an ex-partner

570
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,256
who nearly drank
himself into oblivion.

571
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,422
Did he get help?

572
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:28,656
Yeah.

573
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,261
Help didn't help.

574
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,436
Oh, God!

575
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,002
What is it?

576
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,737
I went to the bathroom.

577
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,484
Patient's lost
bowel control.

578
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,318
Means we were
wrong about HSAN

579
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,914
and means he's
getting worse, fast.

580
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:56,926
Wouldn't want to be the duty
nurse assigned to his floor.

581
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:59,224
Get it? "Doody" nurse?

582
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:01,423
Fine, do the doctor thing.

583
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,898
An autoimmune
disorder could explain...

584
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,367
We put him on steroids, he didn't
respond. It's not autoimmune.

585
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,630
Could be Wilson's Disease.

586
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,501
Disease that advanced
would've hit the liver.

587
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:12,669
It is possible the liver is so
far gone, the labs look normal.

588
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:14,904
It's worth a shot.

589
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,606
Go treat
with penicillamine.

590
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,676
And when he doesn't get
better, come back quickly,

591
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,184
so we can get one
more shot at it.

592
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,383
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

593
00:35:35,032 --> 00:35:36,761
Take your time.

594
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,031
How long has it been
since your last confession?

595
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:42,629
I killed a man.

596
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:45,066
Oh.

597
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:47,976
But it was
the right thing to do.

598
00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:52,476
Who lives or dies is not
your decision to make.

599
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:56,782
Sometimes in the operating
room, it feels like it.

600
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,721
I'm a doctor.

601
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,219
Well, then you should
know more than anybody

602
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:04,318
that every
human life is sacred.

603
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,163
Why?

604
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,665
Tell me what's sacred
about a dictator

605
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:12,726
that kills hundreds of
thousands of his own people.

606
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:16,034
What is sacred about a
doctor who kills a patient?

607
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,279
Is it just the slippery
slope you're worried about?

608
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,679
Afraid that forgiving me
for killing

609
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,378
the worst person on earth
sets a bad precedent?

610
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:32,487
I promise,
I won't tell anyone.

611
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,524
Just forgive me.

612
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,094
Saying 10 Hail Marys isn't
going to do you any good.

613
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,763
Then what do I have to do?

614
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,475
What does God
need me to do?

615
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,170
You can't
have absolution

616
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,406
without first
taking responsibility.

617
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,480
You have to turn yourself
in to the police.

618
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,350
What, and... And go to jail
for the rest of my life?

619
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,355
What's just about that?

620
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,086
I did the right thing.

621
00:37:10,995 --> 00:37:12,860
There has to
be another way.

622
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,956
You want absolution,
I told you how to get it.

623
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,086
Send this in to
the State Licensing Board.

624
00:37:41,158 --> 00:37:43,524
I've signed off
on all your hours.

625
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,352
Why?

626
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,260
Because it's easier
this way.

627
00:37:47,331 --> 00:37:49,026
You're uncomfortable
with me.

628
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:50,459
No.

629
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:52,833
Going by the book
was pointless.

630
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:53,927
You were gonna
learn nothing.

631
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:56,337
Good. I thought it was
because of the sexual tension.

632
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,499
There was
no sexual tension.

633
00:37:57,575 --> 00:37:58,599
There was tension.

634
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,702
And it made me
feel funny, so...

635
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,040
Here.

636
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:09,052
It's too bad.

637
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,250
I was kind of getting into the
whole "hot for teacher" thing.

638
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:15,355
You sure you're okay?

639
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:17,722
Yeah. False alarm.

640
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,132
What about us?

641
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,398
We're good.
Just like this.

642
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,800
You press my buttons,
I press yours.

643
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,862
By "buttons,"
you mean...

644
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,038
Huh.

645
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,113
You do make me
feel funny.

646
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,927
You're not gonna die.

647
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,527
I've accepted it.
It's okay.

648
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,696
In addition to
high arches

649
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,297
and some crystal bowl
in the shape of a tuna,

650
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:08,004
you also inherited
a self-destruct button.

651
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,037
Forms in the brain stem.

652
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,379
Technically, it's an
aneurysm, presses on nerves

653
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:16,477
<i>that control everything from
tooth pain to heart rate.</i>

654
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:18,385
<i>As you get older,
it gets bigger,</i>

655
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:23,052
until finally the button, which I'll
call "intracranial berry aneurysm,"

656
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:26,585
because I had a friend in high school
with that name, stops the signal

657
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,462
<i>from your brain to
your heart and bam!</i>

658
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,731
How do I know you're
not still lying to me?

659
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,498
Saying I'm healthy just
to make me feel better?

660
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:36,631
It does sound
that way, doesn't it?

661
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,675
But this time,
no sugar pills.

662
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,108
I'm going to cut
into your brain

663
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,838
to make you think
that I'm fixing it.

664
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:44,403
And if our fake tests
confirm it,

665
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:46,279
I'm going to be cutting
into your son's brain, too.

666
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,875
Because I'm just
that committed.

667
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:51,080
Michael is going to
be okay?

668
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,420
Unless he walks out of here
and gets run over by a bus,

669
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,791
in which case, I will
reconsider your fate argument.

670
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:03,429
You wanna give him a call? Visiting
hours don't apply to my patients.

671
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:06,293
Yeah. In a bit.

672
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:10,504
Yeah, that's what I thought.

673
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,768
The "saving the kid
from pain" stuff was crap.

674
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,779
You just don't want anything in
your life that won't let you do

675
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:17,973
whatever the hell
you want to do

676
00:40:18,048 --> 00:40:20,073
whenever the hell
you want to do it.

677
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:23,450
You've had it easy.
Sorry to screw you up.

678
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,336
Mom.

679
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,288
Maybe when
we get out of here...

680
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,291
What kind of movies
you like?

681
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:22,310
He's been missing for eight
hours. Robert Chase. C-H-A-S...

682
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,841
Hey!

683
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,676
Never mind.
He just walked in. Sorry.

684
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:29,741
You could've called me.

685
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,121
I forgot.
To call me?

686
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,919
It's 2:00 in the morning.
Where were you?

687
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,323
You're drunk.

688
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:37,553
All right, I...

689
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,697
I needed to get wasted.
I did.

690
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,097
And now I'm better.

691
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,336
What aren't
you telling me?

692
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,631
Nothing.

Hi, Dad.

694
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:41,290
I think I've been

695
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,351
focusing on
the wrong thing.

696
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:50,061
There were
some good times.

697
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,370
Wilson, this is stupid!

698
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,610
You see?

699
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:04,676
He really is
getting better.
