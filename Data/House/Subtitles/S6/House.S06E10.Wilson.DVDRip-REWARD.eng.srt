1
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,869
How the...

2
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:38,036
You know, most people go for
the hardwood or carpeting.

3
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:41,005
I think guitars and
garbage work just as well.

4
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,042
Got the urge
to play last night,

5
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,576
had to go all the way
back to my apartment.

6
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:46,271
Thought I'd save
on future trips.

7
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,438
Hmm.

8
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,912
That's very
eco-friendly of you.

9
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,350
How about keeping down
on the noise pollution?

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,412
6:33. You should
be flossing by now.

11
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,956
I'm not going
to work today.

12
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,290
I'm going hunting.

13
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,826
After I sleep in.

14
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,375
Is it that time
of year again?

15
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,845
He's a self-important jerk.

16
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,043
He's my friend.

17
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,814
He's a self-important jerk.

18
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,787
Seems to be what
I'm attracted to.

19
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,381
Guy calls you Jim. Doesn't
even know your name.

20
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:37,294
Jim is short for James.
Now go away, Lim.

21
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:43,960
Nice shot, Jim.

22
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,231
Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,830
Oh, yeah.
I nailed that tree.

24
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,967
Maple syrup
for dinner.

25
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,068
We should have
got a guide.

26
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,442
Doesn't count as
a new adventure

27
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,242
if you have someone
holding your hand.

28
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,306
On the other hand,
we are holding weapons

29
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,181
and have no idea
what we're doing. Fun.

30
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:02,282
We need to
sneak up on them.

31
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,118
I read somewhere that
the Native Americans say

32
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,021
turkeys know
what you're thinking.

33
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,083
So I should stop thinking
about German porn.

34
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,561
No, no.
That'll lure them closer.

35
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,437
We're terrible at this.

36
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:26,775
Yeah. Well, at least it's
cold and my new boots leak.

37
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,906
It's almost time anyway.
Did you bring the bag?

38
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,533
May 30th, 2004,
10:07 a. m.

39
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,229
Dr. Wilson informed me that
if treatment didn't go well,

40
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,704
my leukemia would give me
only six more months to live.

41
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:57,971
November 30th, 2004, six
months later, I didn't die.

42
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,111
As long as I am alive,

43
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,205
I will find new
and exciting ways

44
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,750
to thank you for
giving me another year.

45
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,150
Now move very,
very far away from there,

46
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,750
so that I can be sure
and thank you again next year.

47
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,945
Thanks, Jim.

48
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,879
All right. Let's see how
many more turkeys we can miss.

49
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,255
Yeah, this'll work.

50
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,052
What the hell?

51
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,359
God, sorry. I don't know what happened.

52
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,831
I can't move my arm.

53
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,601
Am I having a stroke?

54
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,931
I don't know.

55
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,808
Good news. Head CT doesn't
show any signs of a stroke.

56
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,014
So he's gonna
be okay, right?

57
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,253
I cannot believe how much you've
grown up in five years. She's...

58
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,593
She's not Emily.

59
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,131
Ashley. My girlfriend.

60
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,758
New life, new adventures.
Ashley, meet Jim.

61
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:02,858
It's good to meet you.

62
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:06,336
So this arm thing, does that
mean his leukemia's back?

63
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,273
I checked blood counts
and blood cell morphologies.

64
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,434
Everything is normal.

65
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,911
So these blood tests, that
means it's not cancer for sure?

66
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,072
He said I'm fine.

67
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,479
So what do
you think it is?

68
00:05:16,549 --> 00:05:18,244
Hopefully
something innocuous.

69
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,481
There's a doctor I can
speak to who's great...

70
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,280
Who's great
at diagnosing...

71
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:26,852
What?

72
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,186
Sorry, that cold sore.

73
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,853
How long
have you had that?

74
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,362
Um, two weeks. I'm sorry.

75
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,262
I got the call, I didn't
have time to cover it up.

76
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,322
What is it, Jim?

77
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,196
That cold sore is
caused by a virus.

78
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:42,036
Assuming you guys kiss,
the virus could transfer,

79
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,406
infect your spine and
cause the paralysis.

80
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,206
It's a disease called
Transverse Myelitis.

81
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,803
And is that
good news or bad news?

82
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,044
It's great news. I'll get you a
room and start you on acyclovir.

83
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:28,115
I just had
a House moment.

84
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:31,179
Diagnosed Transverse Myelitis
from a cold sore.

85
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,519
How cool is that?

86
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,194
Patients really eat
that crap up.

87
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,924
It's why I'm loved.
What am I doing here?

88
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,397
Ultrasound is clear.

89
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,400
Which means he's definitely
not pregnant, right?

90
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:47,569
No gall stones.
Could be diverticulitis.

91
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,335
Have you eaten
any seeds?

92
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,468
I'm joining you,
Antonio Aguilar.

93
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,569
We'll play in
God's Mariachi band.

94
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,443
Draw some blood.

95
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,848
The self-important jerk does
not have Transverse Myelitis.

96
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,546
He's got cancer.

97
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,645
How do you even...

98
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,189
Okay.

99
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,657
Maybe I paid the redhead
down in records a few bucks

100
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:08,785
to CC me
on all your cases.

101
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,920
A few patients die,
you might get sad again,

102
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,794
make a speech that
would end your career.

103
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:15,333
Frankly,
I'm stalking you for you.

104
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:16,959
How long does
a simple blood draw take?

105
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,094
Almost finished.

106
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,503
Well, when you're finished
almost finishing it, test it.

107
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:23,303
My stomach was ripped
open by the hand of God.

108
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:24,502
He spilled my blood.

109
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:26,272
Confusion. Delirium.

110
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:29,109
Why rule out
the hand of God so fast?

111
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:31,878
Your guy's low white count
and right arm paralysis

112
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,682
equals a recurrence of
his leukemia. Simple math.

113
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,052
Did you look past the
first page of the file?

114
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:43,152
No AML cells anywhere.
I did the blood smears myself.

115
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:46,323
It's still cancer.
You know how I know?

116
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,731
He's got an oncologist
for a doctor.

117
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,099
And your magical
leukemia detector

118
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,762
is more powerful
than a flow cytometer?

119
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,798
I look for zebras because other
doctors rule out all the horses.

120
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,106
In this case, you are
those other doctors.

121
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:01,203
You haven't
earned a zebra.

122
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,339
Hundred bucks.
Are you serious?

123
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,943
Look, friends don't diagnose
friends with cancer. I get it.

124
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,816
Your problem is
you're not objective.

125
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,186
Your caring is
clouding your diagnosis.

126
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,385
If you just cut that out, you
could be a pretty decent doctor.

127
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,859
Just give me
the lactic acid level.

128
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,021
Twenty-seven.

129
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,898
The fact that you
can't speak English

130
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:24,266
is not an excuse for you not being
humiliated by what I'm about to say.

131
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,668
It's also not
an excuse for you

132
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,865
not telling us that
you were a tennis pro.

133
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,669
If you had, we wouldn't
have wasted our time.

134
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,733
Fine. Hundred bucks.

135
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:37,713
Tucker settling in?

136
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:40,377
Yep. Already got his
first dose of acyclovir.

137
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,580
And don't worry, I ordered
his girlfriend the kiddie meal.

138
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,848
Next patient on deck.

139
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,653
Del Clinton,
day six of chemo.

140
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,886
You just missed
the grandkids.

141
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,984
Oh.

142
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:53,088
That's all right. Last time they
were here, they painted my tie.

143
00:08:56,068 --> 00:09:00,004
You're almost ready to
go home. You feeling okay?

144
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,836
I feel like I felt
after the last four rounds.

145
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,072
In oncology, familiar
pain means all is well.

146
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:07,203
So that's good, right?

147
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,304
Yeah.

148
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,406
I heard Jesse and
Zeke were by earlier.

149
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,609
Yeah.

150
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,313
I'm sorry, Del,
I gotta run.

151
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,986
How are they doing?

152
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,756
They're fine.

153
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:27,765
No game-winning hits? No aced
report cards? No school plays?

154
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,494
I guess not.

155
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,494
I thought you had to go.

156
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,035
Are you depressed?

157
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,474
I have cancer.

158
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:40,808
You've had cancer
for a long time,

159
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,869
and it's never
stopped you

160
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,438
from bragging
about the grandkids.

161
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,710
Oh.

162
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:48,049
I guess I'm feeling a
little more down than usual.

163
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,485
Can you give me
something?

164
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:50,681
Yeah.

165
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,485
I don't want you
to get alarmed,

166
00:09:52,558 --> 00:09:54,617
but sometimes depression
can be a sign

167
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,093
that something else
is going on.

168
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:59,461
I'm just gonna order a
couple of extra tests, okay?

169
00:10:07,239 --> 00:10:09,070
What's going on?
It's his foot now.

170
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,199
It's nothing.

171
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,436
It's not nothing.

172
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,241
I just started getting a little
tingling feeling in my foot.

173
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,104
Is that bad?

174
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:18,275
Ashley,
it's gonna be okay.

175
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,320
It might mean his foot fell
asleep. It might mean nothing.

176
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:23,082
Can you give us
a few minutes?

177
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,452
Why can't you tell me?

178
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,150
Because you're
making him nervous.

179
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:28,989
Just give us a few minutes, okay, hon?

180
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,493
Does this mean that it's not
the disease you thought it was?

181
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,727
It means the medicine
I gave you is not working.

182
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,792
I just might have
to hit it harder.

183
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,634
I'm going to add ribavirin
to your treatment.

184
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:41,866
Jim.

185
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,105
Are you sure that
this isn't a recurrence?

186
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,737
So the brave face
is just for Ashley.

187
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,508
She's young
and she's terrified.

188
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,606
She's not
really equipped.

189
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,116
Don't worry.

190
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:57,447
Once you've had cancer, recurrence
is your biggest fear. I get it.

191
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,388
I've looked at this thing
every which way there is.

192
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,358
That's not
what's happening here.

193
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,590
Can you call my daughter
and ask her to come down?

194
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,858
You can't do it?

195
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,456
She hasn't exactly
been talking to me

196
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,195
since I got together
with Ashley.

197
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,669
I'd really like her
to be here.

198
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,439
Of course.

199
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,410
Exactly how serious
does it have to be

200
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,379
to justify you coming
to see your father?

201
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,612
No, I'm sorry.

202
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,451
I'd rather you regretted coming
than regretted not coming.

203
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,914
Thanks, Emily.

204
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,191
How's Tucker?

205
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:37,923
Well, he's made a mess
of his personal life,

206
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,897
but physically I think
he's going to be fine.

207
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,694
Transverse Myelitis.

208
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,257
What does House think?

209
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,600
What is this?
Is House my overseer now?

210
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,731
No, it's just not
always a good idea

211
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:51,140
for doctors to treat
their friends, that's all.

212
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,269
Well, House has got
100 bucks on cancer.

213
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,336
So unless you want
in on the action...

214
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:58,178
Um, is Bonnie
still a realtor?

215
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:00,084
As far as I know.

216
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:04,282
Do you mind if I call her?
I'm looking for a new place.

217
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,459
I'm moving in
with Lucas.

218
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,358
It wasn't the tennis.

219
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,821
You're moving in
with Lucas?

220
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:14,224
Yes.

221
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,629
You're Bonnie's friend,
you know how to reach her,

222
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,762
and yet,
instead of calling her,

223
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,830
you come and seek
my permission.

224
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,206
You want my blessing, and,
implicitly, House's blessing.

225
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,006
I don't need
House's blessing.

226
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,606
Good.

227
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,088
So when will he be able
to move his arm again?

228
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,784
Should be soon.

229
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,019
You started smoking again?

230
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,219
No.

231
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,888
What does that mean? Is
it bad that he's coughing?

232
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,899
Hi, Dad.
Hey.

233
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,527
Melissa, hey. I didn't
know you were coming.

234
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,265
I was at Mom's house
when Dr. Wilson called.

235
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,397
I can go if it's
gonna be weird.

236
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,667
No, no.
Stay, it's fine.

237
00:12:57,743 --> 00:12:58,869
Hi.

238
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:00,434
How are you?
Is he okay?

239
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:04,847
Yeah, he's okay. I'm not a big
fan of his coughing, though.

240
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:06,578
You must be Ashley.
Hi.

241
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,750
Hey, are you okay?

242
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:13,920
Do you think this cold sore
thing could've caused this?

243
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,789
No. Whatever is causing this is
affecting more than his nerves.

244
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,126
I need a crash cart
in here.

245
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,539
Don't you guys have a dying
Mexican crooner to attend to?

246
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,078
He isn't dying
any more.

247
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,909
Found out he was
on a popcorn diet,

248
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,506
eating 10 bags of
microwave popcorn a day.

249
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,052
Huffing the fumes
scarred his lungs.

250
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,921
Wow. That's very strange.
Where's House?

251
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,982
Performing his ritual
"hiding from Cuddy

252
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,652
"to avoid getting
a new case" dance.

253
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,356
It's sort of a jazz-fusion
type of thing.

254
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,023
He's probably eating
lunch in the morgue.

255
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,657
I can page him to your
office if you want.

256
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:59,534
Actually, maybe it would be
better if I talk to you guys alone.

257
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,039
House and I have a bet
about one of my patients.

258
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,076
You guys mind making him
100 bucks poorer?

259
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,276
Forty-three-year-old male
in remission from leukemia,

260
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,816
presents with left-arm
paralysis and trouble breathing.

261
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,579
I assume House's
money is on cancer.

262
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,119
Thanks,
that's very helpful.

263
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,552
Subdural hematoma
would explain...

264
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:17,884
CT ruled it out.

265
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:20,050
I thought it was TM, so I
started him on anti-virals.

266
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,116
But he got worse.
Bacterial infection?

267
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,560
Bacteria would move much faster
than this, he'd be dead already.

268
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,688
It could be fungal.

269
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:27,629
A fungal infection would
explain his breathing problem,

270
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,601
but not his "unable to
move his arm" problem.

271
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:35,470
Actually, if aspergillus fungus
balls took root in his lungs

272
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:39,170
and spread to his spine,
it would explain both.

273
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,743
Thanks.

274
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,318
The treatment involves
riddling the infected area

275
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,048
with BB-sized pellets
of anti-fungal meds.

276
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:54,354
I assume you don't just load up the
12 gauge and pepper me with birdshot.

277
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,293
No, we have a slightly
more humane delivery system.

278
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,799
But we do have to open
you up. It is surgery.

279
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:04,495
And like any operation,
there are risks.

280
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,629
What do you think,
honey?

281
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,734
I don't know. I mean, is
surgery really such a good idea?

282
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,801
He just seems so sick.
I just...

283
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,712
You should do whatever
you think is best.

284
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,983
Is this the only way
to go after this thing?

285
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,451
Because of
the rapid progression,

286
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,681
I don't think we have time
to test or try IVs.

287
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,485
And he's strong enough
to endure anesthesia?

288
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,717
Definitely.

289
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,157
I want you there
during the surgery.

290
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,319
Of course.

291
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,358
You gotta do it.

292
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,490
Good.

293
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,560
Dr. Chase will be in here soon
to get you set up for the OR.

294
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:43,637
Page Dr. Chase to Tucker's
room for a surgery consult,

295
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:44,698
and can you get me...

296
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,540
Mr. Koplovitz wants
to talk to you.

297
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,670
Is everything all right?

298
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,008
He wanted to
talk to his doctor,

299
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,605
not his
doctor's assistant.

300
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,378
Oh. And House is
looking for you.

301
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,475
What'd you tell him?

302
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,541
That you were
in the clinic.

303
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,713
I figure that gives you
about 10 minutes.

304
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,314
Here, Mr. Koplovitz's
chart, go.

305
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,188
Hello, Saul. I heard
you were looking for me.

306
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,496
I'm very tired,
but I can't sleep.

307
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:13,368
Today's your lucky day. I
happen to be a sleep specialist.

308
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,572
Thanks, Doc.

309
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,153
Hey, can't a guy
get a little privacy?

310
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,589
Nice hiding spot.

311
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,853
Actually, it's perfect.

312
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,021
It allows me to hide
from Cuddy and find you.

313
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,359
What did she want?

314
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,195
She was checking up
on Tucker, thanks to you.

315
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,894
That's it?

316
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:46,403
Like what?
Something about you?

317
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,872
Something you could
interpret as being about you?

318
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,067
An anagram maybe?

319
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,439
It'd be great
if you could play

320
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,943
hide and seek somewhere
else, my patient's...

321
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:56,277
No problem. Just give me the 100
bucks you owe me and I'm gone.

322
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,713
Tucker doesn't
have cancer.

323
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,513
He doesn't have a ball of
fungus in his lungs either.

324
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:01,780
Next time you want
to use my team,

325
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,378
I suggest you
at least leave a tip.

326
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,252
I'm late for surgery.

327
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,849
Ah. Your assistant said you'd
be in here. I talked to Bonnie.

328
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,555
Let's take this outside. Mr.
Koplovitz just got to sleep.

329
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,222
Oh, sorry. She found
us this fantastic loft.

330
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:14,322
Outside.

331
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,833
It's not a loft,
it's just more urban.

332
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:17,391
Not that I'm urban,
but I used to be.

333
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,165
It's got two bedrooms, got wonderful
views. It's a really great place.

334
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,173
Procedure should
take about an hour.

335
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,275
I'll be observing
the entire time.

336
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,708
Thanks.

337
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,905
Maybe it'd be better if
you would stay with Ashley.

338
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,504
She's more scared
than I am.

339
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:32,806
Well, she's...

340
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,118
At her age,

341
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:39,151
she's not supposed to be dealing
with issues of life and death.

342
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,455
Wasn't what I was planning
when I went after her.

343
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,060
Why did you
leave Melissa?

344
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,861
We got married young.
We...

345
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,795
I'm not sure.

346
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,382
There's nothing
to talk about.

347
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,454
Why are you doing surgery when
I need you finding me a new case?

348
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,156
<i>You don't
want a new case.</i>

349
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,098
Oh, right.
Guess I'm here for Wilson.

350
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:25,631
Obviously,
you didn't tell me

351
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,399
that Cuddy was
moving in with Lucas

352
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,737
because you
were protecting me,

353
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:31,537
which is odd,
since I told you

354
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,976
that I'm fine with
their relationship.

355
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,314
So, obviously, you question
one of those assumptions

356
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,350
or you have
an issue with logic.

357
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,579
Yes, you're fine
with them dating.

358
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:45,555
But moving in together is a
whole other level of commitment.

359
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:48,788
This is
the 21st century, Wilson.

360
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:52,228
I realize that the logical
course in any adult relationship

361
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,925
could one day lead
to fornication.

362
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,527
Although, the fact that
she wants to buy a loft

363
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:01,369
could actually mean
that their relationship

364
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,067
is not as serious
as I thought.

365
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,667
Oh, for God's sake, House,
don't do this to yourself.

366
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,871
It's a loft,
it has no deeper meaning

367
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,039
than open-spaced
living arrangement.

368
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:11,707
You bought into
her diatribe

369
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,877
about rediscovering her
lost city-girl roots?

370
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:17,649
And two bedrooms, it just
reeks of commitment issues.

371
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,918
Yeah, or she has a baby.
Well...

372
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,052
This is classic
mid-life Cuddy crisis.

373
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,221
This is her version of
a two-seat convertible.

374
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,697
Yep, clearly you're
fine with it.

375
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:31,258
<i>Wilson, he's got global lung
damage. Means it's not fungal.</i>

376
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,963
<i>It's PCP pneumonia.</i>

377
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:38,935
Hmm.

378
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:43,707
Obviously, something is
knocking out his immune system.

379
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,912
HIV, acquired SCID,

380
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:51,114
or, my personal favorite,
cancer.

381
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,191
I'm sure you'll test
for all three.

382
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,431
Sixty-two-year-old
African-American man

383
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:06,494
with lymphoma
now in remission.

384
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,506
I did a CT and
found a small lesion

385
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:10,439
on the upper lobe
of his left lung.

386
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:11,498
But if he's
in remission,

387
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,135
why did you bother
scanning him?

388
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,577
During a routine
follow-up,

389
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:16,511
I realized the patient
was depressed.

390
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:19,073
Wow. That's quite a call.

391
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,015
Thanks.
The treatment indicated...

392
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,955
Oh, I'm sorry,

393
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,049
I didn't realize you were
in the middle of something.

394
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,755
It's a conference room
with glass walls.

395
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,229
You thought
I'd be alone?

396
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,357
Your patient has cancer.

397
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,994
Not that guy, who
probably also has cancer.

398
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,698
And who's probably
also your buddy.

399
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,933
Thought you'd
want to know.

400
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,135
And you owe me
100 bucks.

401
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,142
You have acute
lymphoblastic leukemia. ALL.

402
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,223
So it is a recurrence?

403
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:02,954
No, it's different.
It's a second leukemia,

404
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,723
probably caused
by the chemotherapy

405
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,058
we gave him
five years ago.

406
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:07,928
That's why you
didn't see it?

407
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,332
Maybe they can
rename it Ironic leukemia.

408
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,596
This is not the end.

409
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,104
Tests show that the cancer
is limited to your brain.

410
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,230
That's good news.

411
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:17,104
How can cancer in his head be good news?

412
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:20,611
The blood-brain barrier
separates the blood in your head

413
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,704
from the blood
in your body,

414
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,182
keeps the cancer bottled up.
We can go for a cure.

415
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,180
So give me the numbers.
What are we looking at?

416
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:30,619
Ninety percent
chance of cure.

417
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,589
Really?
What if we're in the 10%?

418
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:37,151
Steady decline, but six
months of a good quality life.

419
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,595
Does he have to go through
another bone marrow transplant?

420
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:43,157
No. Chemotherapy. We can
go at this with drugs alone.

421
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,262
When do we get started?

422
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,134
We begin by surgically
planting a shunt,

423
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:49,332
so we can get the drugs
directly into your brain.

424
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,773
I already booked the OR.

425
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,333
You're the only one who can
make cancer sound like good news.

426
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,471
We get it out of your head
and you walk out of here.

427
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,947
Paralysis gone
and cancer free.

428
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,886
We also need you to
sign a healthcare proxy.

429
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,513
If something goes wrong
in surgery,

430
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,751
someone needs to be appointed
to make decisions for you.

431
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,225
What are the chances
of that happening?

432
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:10,420
Very remote.

433
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,861
I think maybe Melissa
should be my proxy.

434
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,626
What?
No.

435
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,328
Coming through.
House got a new case.

436
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,199
Revised OR schedule. Sorry,
Wilson, had to bump you.

437
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:24,105
It's not like your guy is
bleeding out of his eyes.

438
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,803
House, your guy's not bleeding
out of his eyes, either.

439
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:27,538
The nurse who books the OR thinks he is.

440
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:28,977
Your case is no more
urgent than mine.

441
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,242
Yeah, but you're
way more patient.

442
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:33,976
It's okay.

443
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:37,510
You can talk about the
paperwork in the prep area.

444
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,551
You trust her
more than me?

445
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,060
About this, yes.

446
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,458
You've been through
the good stuff,

447
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,159
but Melissa's been to
hell and back with me.

448
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,692
She gives me the best shot
of getting through this.

449
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,466
You still love her.

450
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,099
Don't be silly.
I love you.

451
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,471
Please, don't make this
into more than it is.

452
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,851
Okay. Anything?
No.

453
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,516
Can you feel this?

454
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,717
No.

455
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,881
How about here?

456
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,516
No.

457
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,728
Where is everybody?

458
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,198
Melissa and Emily went
downstairs to get some breakfast.

459
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,326
Ashley?
She had work to do.

460
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,633
I thought
she was off today.

461
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,138
Well, she didn't
really have work to do.

462
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:30,640
She's just pissed, so she
pretended to have work to do.

463
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:32,199
I let her pretend.

464
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:34,271
Okay.

465
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,442
Move your fingers.

466
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,250
The chemo's not working.

467
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:48,815
Does that mean
it's not cancer?

468
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,328
No. It means the chemo from
your first round of treatment

469
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:53,830
has made
the leukemia resistant.

470
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,595
So I'm in the 10%
that don't get cured.

471
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:01,537
Maybe not.

472
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,470
We just removed a screw
from a guy's lung,

473
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,342
and the weird thing is,
he didn't get better.

474
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,675
Any idea
what that means?

475
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:11,340
It means you're
not listening to me.

476
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,644
No, it means
I'm ignoring you

477
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,344
to make a point.
There is a difference.

478
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,545
The problem with
that technique

479
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,349
is I have no idea
what point you're making.

480
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:20,448
That your idea is implicitly
not worth responding to.

481
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,892
Doubling your patient's
chemo dose is stupid.

482
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,259
Damn, now it's explicit.

483
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,890
It could swamp out the
resistance of the cancer cells.

484
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,524
The fact that it
theoretically should work

485
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:30,966
doesn't make it
any less stupid.

486
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:33,504
Of course it does. It's
exactly what you would do.

487
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:35,437
I'm me. You're you.

488
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,377
And a table is a table.

489
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:44,404
And chemo is poison, and
double chemo is double poison.

490
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:48,552
And I can handle it when
things go wrong. You can't.

491
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:52,117
And things could
go very, very wrong.

492
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:55,820
I can handle it.

493
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,532
Sounds pretty dangerous.

494
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:06,130
It is.

495
00:25:08,473 --> 00:25:10,498
What do you think, Mel?

496
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:15,512
I think you
should call Ashley.

497
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:18,677
You're my family.

498
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,310
I'm sorry I forgot that.

499
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,920
I think
that you should try

500
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,985
whatever could keep you
with us longer.

501
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,025
Yeah.

502
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,649
Look.

503
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,853
I can move them.

504
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,794
Hey.
Thank you.

505
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,291
What is it, Jim?

506
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,436
I'm gonna need
to run some tests.

507
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,041
Intraepidermal superficial
bullae. Could be pemphigus.

508
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,576
Or it could be
from the fire.

509
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:23,205
Either way, he's dead.
We can't stop the oozing.

510
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,147
Don't care.

511
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,452
I'm here
because it's 1:15

512
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:33,048
and Wilson started testing
at 12:45, which means...

513
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:37,584
The cancer is gone, but over
half his hepatocytes are dead.

514
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,925
In only 24 hours?

515
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,667
He needs a new liver.

516
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,405
Look on the bright side.

517
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:52,102
You can publish the
results of this case study.

518
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,873
No one will ever
double the dose again.

519
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,614
The double dose of chemo
got rid of your cancer,

520
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,383
but it also
trashed your liver.

521
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,858
If I don't find you
a new liver...

522
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:12,219
You've only got
about 24 hours left.

523
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:15,933
So what do we do now?

524
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:21,562
Your father's been moved to
the top of the transplant list.

525
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,107
But all we
really can do is wait.

526
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,164
That's it? We wait?

527
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,437
Tell me something
that I can do.

528
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,739
I'm sorry, Mel.

529
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,007
You and Emily don't match
Tuck's blood type,

530
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,072
and neither does Ashley.

531
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,884
So a live liver donation
is out.

532
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:39,219
The best thing to do is
just what you've been doing,

533
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,114
be together.

534
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,065
Hope he already told you
that you're gonna die,

535
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,193
'cause it's gonna make what I'm
about to say a lot more relevant.

536
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:54,898
House, I know it's raining out
there in the hallway, but...

537
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:59,034
I was just in the ER, testing my
patient for autonomic dysfunction.

538
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:00,168
It's the only department
with a shower

539
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,974
big enough for
the whole team,

540
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:05,642
plus the cardiac monitors, plus
me, plus... Anyway, relevant part.

541
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,345
We're just wheeling the
guy out, a trauma came in.

542
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,614
Motorcycle versus semi.

543
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:10,812
How bad?

544
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,188
Bad for the motorcycle, good for
your liver. Blood type's a match.

545
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,283
Why wasn't I paged?

546
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,987
Because there is a problem.

547
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,791
No organ donor card.

548
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,490
Dead guy's sister
is next of kin,

549
00:28:20,565 --> 00:28:22,362
she's refusing to
allow the donation.

550
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:23,458
Where is she?

551
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,559
Twenty minutes away.

552
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:29,769
How do you get the call
that your brother's dead,

553
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,240
and then run
out the door?

554
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,674
"That reminds me,

555
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,803
"I had dry cleaning
to pick up. "

556
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,212
Did Cuddy buy the place?

557
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:39,845
Not yet.

558
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:41,843
You okay?

559
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,410
Just making conversation.

560
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,617
Yours was getting boring.

561
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,884
What are you planning?

562
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,448
I'm not planning anything.

563
00:28:48,526 --> 00:28:49,550
And I don't believe you.

564
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,219
How are you gonna punish
her for dating Lucas?

565
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:54,322
Okay, now this conversation
is getting boring.

566
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,292
Are you really okay?
No.

567
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,235
I am not okay.
Not even close.

568
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:07,370
Wow. Okay. See, that's
very adult of you.

569
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,279
No, it isn't.

570
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,279
It's just me
accepting the fact

571
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,180
that there's nothing
I can do and moving on.

572
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,277
Which is, I think,
the definition of adulthood.

573
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,822
Well, if it is, being
a kid is a lot more fun.

574
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:21,549
It's show time.

575
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,792
I didn't speak
to him for years.

576
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,839
But when my parents died,
at their funeral,

577
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,736
we made peace.

578
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,673
Our parents must
have blessed it.

579
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:46,012
And I'm sure they would
want him to do good

580
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,951
with his last act
in this world.

581
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,250
They wanted us
to be friends.

582
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:55,520
Our relationship wasn't
strong, but it was growing.

583
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:58,289
If I allow you to
defile his body,

584
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,354
it will destroy
that bond.

585
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,422
<i>The itai will be harmed.</i>

586
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,060
It will save
my patient's life.

587
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:13,405
What if I told you
that he wasn't dead?

588
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,114
Are you saying
my brother's still alive?

589
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,877
I'm saying
you're being an idiot,

590
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,645
but I don't have time to
talk you out of your religion,

591
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:22,413
so I'm stuck with
giving you a technicality

592
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,923
that will let you justify
doing the right thing.

593
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,424
What if his last
living act

594
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,290
Was to donate
a part of his liver?

595
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:33,797
Not the whole thing,
just one small piece.

596
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,490
Then I'm not
defiling a dead body.

597
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:40,662
House. The last generous
act of a living person.

598
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,672
House. It's too late.

599
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,505
The liver started
to degrade.

600
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,045
It's no longer viable
for transplant.

601
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,750
Well played. Religion
just killed another person.

602
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:05,290
It's not fair, Jim.

603
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:09,391
You just helped me get
my family back together.

604
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:14,165
I'm not ready.

605
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,801
I would've had six more months with them

606
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,405
if you hadn't given me
that extra chemo.

607
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,780
Now I have less
than one day.

608
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,810
I'm sorry.
We knew the risks.

609
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,152
I don't want to
lose them again.

610
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,191
I can't lose them again.

611
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:38,794
There's nothing
more we can do.

612
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:46,162
Five years ago, when I needed a
transfusion, you used your own blood.

613
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,267
We have the same type,

614
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,571
which means you can give
me a part of your liver.

615
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,504
I'm your doctor.

616
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,208
You're my friend.

617
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,251
Should I die because
you're also my doctor?

618
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,307
Of course not.

619
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:02,648
Fine then, you're fired.

620
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,779
Now you're just my friend.

621
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,383
Now you can do
what's right.

622
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:10,717
Tucker, it's...

623
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,427
I can't.

624
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:25,801
Late night with
the Pigeon sisters?

625
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,276
Every now and again,

626
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:31,474
I'd like to come home
without getting interrogated.

627
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:37,578
Someone's cranky. And
late. Where were you?

628
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,287
Was getting a drink.

629
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,317
Why are all my frozen dinners
thawing on the counter?

630
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:46,693
I needed room for
my margarita jello shots.

631
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,755
I used test tubes
as bottles

632
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,131
so they'll be shaped
like my cane.

633
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:54,470
Why did you go
out drinking alone

634
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:57,372
when you got such
great company here?

635
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,516
Tucker wants me to donate
a lobe of my liver to him.

636
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:11,252
You were out drinking because
you're actually considering this?

637
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,320
Yeah, I was out marinating
my liver in alcohol

638
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:17,190
to get it ready for
the transplant. Yeah.

639
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,853
Your mouth says no,

640
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,921
but your pathetic attempt
at a deflection

641
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,365
has guilt
written all over it.

642
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:25,959
It's my fault.
It is my fault.

643
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,664
I gave him
too much chemo.

644
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,297
You cured his cancer.

645
00:33:29,374 --> 00:33:31,740
And killed him
in the process.

646
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:32,833
Quibbles.

647
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,908
He's had a predictable
complication.

648
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,711
Surprise. Bad things happen
to people who are sick.

649
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,149
Doesn't make
you responsible.

650
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:46,054
Oh. Not legally,
ethically. Ethically.

651
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,557
A table is a table.

652
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,987
Don't be a doormat,
Wilson.

653
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:54,088
Boy, you are... You
willfully ruined my food

654
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,496
and have taken over
my living room

655
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,057
because you already
think I am a doormat.

656
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,763
You know what?

657
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,832
You're wrong.

658
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,877
Clean up your stuff
and get out.

659
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:14,578
You're wrong.

660
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:25,793
How's Tucker?

661
00:34:25,863 --> 00:34:30,766
Still no dancing. But the
scans came in on Del Clinton.

662
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:32,166
It's good news.

663
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,464
Thanks.

664
00:34:33,538 --> 00:34:36,098
Let me know as soon as Tucker
takes a turn for the worse.

665
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:37,971
I want to be there.

666
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:45,044
See that small spot
at the top of the lung?

667
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:49,716
That was then. This is
now. The spot's gone.

668
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,053
That tiny little spot, huh?

669
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,286
Yeah, it's not
too impressive, is it?

670
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,563
That little dot
could have killed me?

671
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,289
Yeah.

672
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:04,500
Fortunately,
we caught it early.

673
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:06,967
It's gonna be okay.

674
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:10,303
That's amazing.
You got all this off me

675
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,740
not talking
about my grandkids.

676
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,017
Thanks, Bonnie.

677
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:24,213
We're just gonna have
to sit tight for a while.

678
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,484
Okay.

679
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:34,030
I put an offer on the loft.
Seller turned me down.

680
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:38,194
I offered exactly what a similar
unit sold for three months ago.

681
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:43,401
I want to donate a lobe
of my liver to Tucker.

682
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:45,966
That's insane.

683
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:49,171
I'm donating
a small portion of...

684
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,340
You have hundreds
of patients.

685
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:53,474
And until I run out
of excess organs,

686
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,712
why shouldn't I do
everything I can to help them?

687
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,778
Because you're a doctor,
not a donor.

688
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,394
Why did you make me
the head of oncology?

689
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:10,991
Not because you
have the most organs.

690
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:14,203
You're thoughtful, caring.

691
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:16,001
Yeah. Caring.

692
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,636
By your own criteria, a
strength and not a weakness.

693
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,439
This is coming
out of guilt.

694
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,446
This is coming
out of friendship.

695
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,379
I have a friend
who's about to die.

696
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,612
And I have the opportunity
to save his life.

697
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,087
Okay.

698
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,531
Call me a doormat,

699
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:53,941
get it all out of your
system, but I'm doing it.

700
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,142
Why?

701
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,775
He's my friend.

702
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,150
I'm your friend.

703
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:08,190
All the pain pills
I've taken?

704
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,590
What if I need
your liver?

705
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,127
Right.
How selfish of me

706
00:37:11,195 --> 00:37:14,426
not to have considered
your possible future needs.

707
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,864
They're all dying.
They're all your friends.

708
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,834
I'm not here
for an argument, House.

709
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,098
No, right,
that's room 12A.

710
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,264
So why are you here?

711
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:27,175
You wanna make sure that
I've called a moving van?

712
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,303
No.

713
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,476
The operation
is in two hours,

714
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,609
and I'd like you
to be there with me.

715
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,416
No.

716
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,456
Why?

717
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,296
Because if you die,
I'm alone.

718
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:36,379
Thanks, Jim.

719
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:56,950
How are you feeling?

720
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,051
Can't complain,

721
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:01,223
considering if it weren't
for you, I'd be dead. Twice.

722
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:03,163
You?

723
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,724
I feel good.

724
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,630
Sending out
your laundry?

725
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,830
Going to rehab.
Someplace up in Katonah.

726
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:14,969
Up by your new house,
not near your old house.

727
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,543
Easier on Ashley.

728
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,111
I see.

729
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,581
I was thrilled to get
the family back together,

730
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:28,022
and Melissa's great
in a crisis,

731
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,418
but the person you want
when you're dying

732
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:35,056
isn't the same as the person
you want when you're living.

733
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:38,632
Hi, Jim.

734
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:42,868
Actually, it's James.

735
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:08,186
You ready to admit that
he's a self-important jerk?

736
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:11,493
I still feel good
about what I did.

737
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,137
You don't feel angry?

738
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:18,102
Oh, I'm a little
disappointed.

739
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,569
Disappointment is anger
for wimps.

740
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,810
You don't have to be so
gentle about everything.

741
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,580
It's okay to get angry
once in a while.

742
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:33,415
You can't
change a table.

743
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,821
Actually, you can.

744
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,661
You just need a coat of
paint and the guts to use it.

745
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,844
Bonnie.

746
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,842
Bonnie told me
what Cuddy bid.

747
00:42:27,912 --> 00:42:29,402
You're gonna
outbid her?

748
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,884
We do need
a bigger refrigerator.

749
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:42,225
She hurt my friend.
She should be punished.

750
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,159
You got mad.

751
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,255
I'm proud of you.

752
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,893
Cuddy won't share
that sentiment.

753
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,902
How are you going
to explain it to her?

754
00:42:53,704 --> 00:42:55,934
I'm changing our address
to a PO box.

755
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:57,735
She'll find out
eventually.

756
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:02,109
A problem delayed
is a problem denied.

757
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,140
Bonnie? I'll take it.

758
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,986
Baby steps.
