1
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,570
Are you ever
coming to bed?

2
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,413
I still say
I'm a vegetarian.

3
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,508
You can say that
you're an astronaut,

4
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:54,075
but that doesn't
make it true.

5
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:56,179
A salmon is not
a vegetable, Frankie.

6
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,484
Well, apparently eight out of
10 commenters agree with you,

7
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,058
except for the part
where you said,

8
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,185
"I believe what
I want to believe. "

9
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:03,557
That, they found
a little judgmental.

10
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,928
You blogged
our argument?

11
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,490
I asked you to quit
talking about me.

12
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,865
I don't want a bunch of
people that I don't know

13
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,938
hearing stuff that's meant
to be between me and you.

14
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,304
I write
about my life,

15
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,706
and you're
a big part of that.

16
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,710
That's great. I want to
be a big part of your life,

17
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,837
but I don't want to be
a big part of their lives.

18
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:24,874
Take it down. Erase it,
delete it, make it go away.

19
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,226
Come on, man,
it's 2:00 in the morning,

20
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,489
these walls are made
of tissue paper.

21
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,997
I gotta be up in three hours to
do a wiring job out in Edison.

22
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,327
Sorry, we'll try
to hold it down.

23
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,424
Sorry.

24
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:44,961
Frankie, what happened?

25
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,172
No, no, that's not what you
think. Something's wrong.

26
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,608
We need a police
car at 152 Haverhill.

27
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,203
What are you two
talking about?

28
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,348
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:58,751 --> 00:01:59,809
Are you all right?

30
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:02,013
I think it's coming from my gums.

31
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,456
What are you
doing tonight?

32
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,965
Masturbating.

33
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,193
I'd invite you, but
people are already talking.

34
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:53,035
It's pathetic. You divide your nights
between porn and the Discovery Channel.

35
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:56,439
<i>Right, playing Dance Dance
Revolution is a much better choice.</i>

36
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:01,276
Okay, that was a gift from a patient,
and it happens to be great exercise.

37
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,145
I mean, who rents
porn anymore?

38
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,912
Can't you get that
stuff on the Internet?

39
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,751
You can, but you can't get disk
two with the director's commentary.

40
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,891
Come out with me tonight.
I'm going speed dating.

41
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,984
If you mean you're dating
on meth, count me in.

42
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:16,083
You need to
meet somebody.

43
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,322
This way, you meet
20 somebodies.

44
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,388
Over a five-minute
discussion of Proust?

45
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,762
Speed dating's
a meat market.

46
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,427
Yeah, dozens of women,
just waiting to be hit on.

47
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:27,337
Your odds of a happy ending are nearly
as good as staying home and watching porn.

48
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,107
You plan on doing
any work today?

49
00:03:38,184 --> 00:03:41,119
I thought I might do a little
light doctoring in the afternoon.

50
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,849
Twenty-eight-year-old female,
sudden unexplained coagulopathy.

51
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,618
Could be congenital
thrombocytopenia.

52
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,818
Platelets look normal.

53
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:48,951
The patient makes money
doing freelance photography.

54
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:51,588
Some photographic processes
produce toxic gases.

55
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,258
She's a blogger. I can't see her
photos being anything but digital.

56
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,270
What does she blog? Politics?
Dominatrix? Cooking? I need recipes.

57
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a personal journal. I don't
get putting your whole life online.

58
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,940
It's not that crazy. Privacy's
basically a modern invention.

59
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,468
Towns used to be too small for
anybody to keep any secrets.

60
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,607
What if it's not the platelets, but
the glue that holds them together?

61
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:13,174
No, thrombin and von
Willebrand factor are normal.

62
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,719
And knowing too much
about each other

63
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,688
is exactly why people leave
small towns and move to the city.

64
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,223
And a lot of people
choose to stay

65
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,988
because in return for zero privacy,
you get community, connection...

66
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:25,360
Big, red A's
for our tunics.

67
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,058
Connections are
for airports.

68
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,657
For people, we have
over 300 cable channels.

69
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,998
Her photos
may be digital,

70
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,470
doesn't mean she couldn't have
been exposed to some other toxin.

71
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,870
We should search
the apartment.

72
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,240
Eenie, meenie, minie,
Thirteen and Tiny.

73
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:44,348
This one's locked.

74
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,678
I'm surprised you took
the pro-community position.

75
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,019
I have friends,
I like people.

76
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,251
You also like secrets.

77
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:56,593
You deny it, that sort
of proves my point.

78
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:00,997
When we're left to our own
devices, we make lousy choices.

79
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,530
Ignore it.

80
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:09,939
I can hear you in there. Open
the door or I'm calling the cops.

81
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,510
We're four stories up, but there's
a fire escape on the other wall.

82
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,239
The ledge might
be wide enough...

83
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,974
We're doctors. We
aren't stealing anything.

84
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,418
We are collecting
samples.

85
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,549
Who are you?
The neighbor.

86
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,749
Did they say that you
could come in here?

87
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,792
Yep. What do you know
about Frankie and Taylor?

88
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:30,727
Not much. The guy works a
lot, but I see Frankie around.

89
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:34,028
We argue a few times a week, and
then we go back about our business.

90
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,124
What do you argue about?

91
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:36,531
Frankie's got some
strong opinions.

92
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,366
Wants to recycle
every molecule of trash.

93
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,430
You take the anti-recycling position?

94
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,977
Trash piling up for composting is
attracting every rat in the neighborhood.

95
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,773
I had to put down poison.

96
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,471
That's her private drawer,
what are you doing over there?

97
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,073
She says she doesn't have any
secrets, I'm taking her at her word.

98
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,210
Is there any chance Frankie
touched the rat poison?

99
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,652
Touched it?
She grabbed a chunk of it

100
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,280
right out of the mouth of the
schnauzer from down the hall.

101
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,383
Now every time I put the stuff
down, she picks it back up.

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,280
You brought a date?

103
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:29,946
Wilson seemed to think
it was a good idea.

104
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:31,546
You need to dive
back into the pool.

105
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,091
And he has
to swim in ours?

106
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,650
You go to a bar, you
bring your ugly friends.

107
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,662
It's not
a beauty pageant.

108
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,357
Life is a beauty pageant.

109
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:42,263
Little girls who kiss frogs
expect them to turn into you.

110
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,599
Come on, I'm not that good-looking.

111
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,796
Yeah, you are.

112
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,330
You kind of are.

113
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,342
So you attribute
every relationship

114
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,504
I've ever had to the
height of my cheekbones?

115
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,274
Not the whole relationship,
just the beginning.

116
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,179
The rest is your hair.
This is ridiculous.

117
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,184
Women aren't as distracted
by appearances as we are.

118
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,651
They look deeper.

119
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,449
You wanna bet?

120
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,858
You can't tell anyone you're
a doctor. You're unemployed.

121
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,861
You're also a little slow.
Misunderstand everything they say.

122
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,658
And lose the accent.

123
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:15,963
A hundred bucks says you still
walk out of here with a dozen names.

124
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,969
Ladies and gentlemen,
the fun is about to start.

125
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,472
When I strike this gong,

126
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,009
each man should sit at the
table you've been assigned.

127
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,568
When I strike it again,
date's over, move on.

128
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:31,975
I'm an oncologist.

129
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,919
My aunt and my grandma, they
both died from breast cancer.

130
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,556
Do you want
to talk about it?

131
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,891
I'm a diagnostician.

132
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,431
I find out what's wrong
with people and I fix it.

133
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,693
Don't all doctors do that?

134
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:52,567
Yeah, but they can't
dance like I can.

135
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,264
I play video games.

136
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,037
Oh, professionally?

137
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,036
I wish, bro.

138
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:06,746
After six months of chemo, we
thought he was out of the woods.

139
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:10,556
I don't want kids.
Check.

140
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,716
I'm thinking about
going from a C to a D.

141
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,884
Quadruple check.

142
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,928
And I'm on fire
for the Lord.

143
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,761
I'm a chocolatier.

144
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,628
I could tell
by your hips.

145
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,759
Yeah, I guess I could
afford to lose a few pounds.

146
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,398
I don't think I know
anybody who died of cancer.

147
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:32,308
Thank God. For you, I mean. Obviously.

148
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:36,575
Except my cat.
She died a few months ago.

149
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,774
I hate these things.

150
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,911
You here at gunpoint?
Need me to call 911?

151
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:45,924
Friend dragged me. She
keeps trying to fix my life,

152
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:49,894
which, admittedly, could
use it, but still, annoying.

153
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:52,426
You like puzzles.

154
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,331
I hoped my job would let me
play with puzzles all day long,

155
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,800
but it didn't work
out that way.

156
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:01,297
Police detective. Turns
out criminals are idiots.

157
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:05,468
If they're not gonna bother to
challenge you, what's the point?

158
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,574
Is there a fire alarm
we could pull?

159
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,345
Maybe get out of here.

160
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:18,451
Except maybe
you're just too swoft.

161
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,558
I beg your pardon?

162
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:23,788
Swoft. It's one of
your crossword answers.

163
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:25,728
I believe it means,
"Lying manipulator

164
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,595
"who tells men anything
they want to hear. "

165
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,329
You brought a prop
as a conversation starter,

166
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,666
folded the paper to make it look
read, filled in some answers,

167
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,069
but you couldn't be
bothered to work at it,

168
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,971
so you just put in
random letters.

169
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:38,602
You have some natural talent as a liar,

170
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,646
but not enough brains
to see it through.

171
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,544
I'm gonna assume
you're not a cop.

172
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,141
Are the five minutes up?

173
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,030
These women would
welcome a call from you.

174
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,293
And these women would
welcome a call from you.

175
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:06,798
My.

176
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,413
It's nice to
have visitors.

177
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:20,542
I'm updating my blog.

178
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,520
And I'm reading it.

179
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,050
You realize you're
in the same room.

180
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:28,390
Sorry.

181
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,252
So I've been thinking
about what you said,

182
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,060
and I'm sure I washed my hands
after I threw out the rat poison.

183
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,657
Apparently you did it multiple
times, over a course of days.

184
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:37,725
Can't be too certain.

185
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,327
You must be
Dr. Foreman.

186
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,438
Gotta get back to work.
Okay.

187
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,872
Take it easy.
Okay.

188
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,576
What? She
reads my blog.

189
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,779
Personally, I don't think
you're condescending at all.

190
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,445
That's not what I wrote. When
you were taking my history,

191
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,454
I told you I went white-water
rafting six months ago,

192
00:10:57,556 --> 00:10:59,683
and you said it was
"unlikely to be related. "

193
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,158
I was just
giving information.

194
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,694
Let's face it,
you got a little snarky.

195
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:04,457
You can't convey a tone
of voice in writing.

196
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,861
I just put
what you said.

197
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,398
If you don't want people
to think you're condescending,

198
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,333
maybe you shouldn't say
condescending things.

199
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:13,037
Can this wait a second?
'Cause I have to pee.

200
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:22,103
I think people behave badly because
there are no records of what we say or do,

201
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,978
and nobody believes anymore
that God's watching.

202
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,551
Well, God's not,
but I am.

203
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,282
Everything is on the record,
including everything I do.

204
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,153
I don't think my pee is
supposed to be mud-colored.

205
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,126
We were wrong
about the rat poison.

206
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,068
Coagulopathy plus
kidney equals what?

207
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,436
Hemolytic
uremic syndrome.

208
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,204
Normal creatinine levels.

209
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,246
She has elevated
cholesterol.

210
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,975
Hey, Wilson!
I can't find my pornos.

211
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:00,641
Have you tried
offering a reward?

212
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:03,881
Gaucher's Disease. It would affect
her ability to synthesize Vitamin K.

213
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,583
She's on a semi-
vegetarian diet.

214
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,148
Means she gets
plenty of Vitamin K.

215
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,090
Sjogrens is more likely.

216
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,061
I assume you moved them
while you were dusting.

217
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,429
I checked the drawers, window
sill, the DVD player in your room.

218
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,968
The quiet ones are
always deeply repressed.

219
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,095
I returned them
to the store.

220
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,900
She had a fish dinner
a couple of nights ago.

221
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:23,066
Could be Haff Disease
causing rhabdo.

222
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,633
What? Why did you return
them to the store?

223
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,475
It's no trouble, I had to stop next
door for my dry cleaning anyway.

224
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,106
Sjogrens would inhibit the clotting
enzymes, infiltrate the kidneys,

225
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:32,650
explains everything.
So does Haff Disease.

226
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,447
I'm not thanking you,
I'm asking you why.

227
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,853
Because if I did happen to
bring a woman home last night,

228
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:41,586
I wanted it to be
a porn-free zone.

229
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,498
You do realize things don't have to
be socks to go into a sock drawer.

230
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,195
I'm sorry.
Horribly, horribly sorry.

231
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,205
I thought you'd
watched them all.

232
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,776
You completely
ruined my morning.

233
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,903
I had to pull out your
old family photos.

234
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,973
Your mom was pretty hot.

235
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:09,780
Haff Disease fits
the timing best.

236
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:12,187
Start her on saline
and Mannitol.

237
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,599
You reading your
patient's blog?

238
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:24,795
No.

239
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,268
You should.
Could be some clues.

240
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,675
Too many. It'd be like
doing a whole body scan,

241
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,974
send us up eight
blind alleys.

242
00:13:34,046 --> 00:13:35,274
That's why
Chase is doing it.

243
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,046
She mentions you.

244
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:40,244
She's never met me.

245
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,951
You're an unseen presence,
like the Wizard of Oz.

246
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:48,424
He was a fraud. She couldn't
have gone with Keyser Söze?

247
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,859
Speaking of movies
that don't make any sense,

248
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,922
I stopped at the rental store
to get those pornos back.

249
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,501
I told the guy at the counter I was
so grateful that you'd returned them,

250
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,232
but I wanted them, and guess
what? You only returned two.

251
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,634
You lost the third.

252
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,940
Decent of you to pay for it,
not let them put it on my bill.

253
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,274
You know...

254
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,040
I can explain
what happened.

255
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:12,208
I'm sure you could,

256
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,752
but rather than listen to your
lies, I thought it'd be more fun

257
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,414
to drive all over town
and get another copy.

258
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,888
You have it here?

259
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:36,939
Oh, God. Oh, God.

260
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,440
Okay, first,
that's not me.

261
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,104
It's not... Mostly not...

262
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:48,151
I was in college! I don't... My
roommate was minoring in film.

263
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,248
Are you
hyperventilating?

264
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,086
Remember that covering your
mouth and one nostril can help.

265
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,594
He had to get this in for some
grade, and he was desperate.

266
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:59,825
And the only reason I did it was
because no one would ever see it.

267
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,162
Who knew he'd become
an actual director?

268
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,032
He's not a director,
he's an artist.

269
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:10,305
The way he plays with light
and darkness and boobs.

270
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,139
Look,
that's not me.

271
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:15,009
<i>What are you?
Where are you taking me?</i>

272
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,706
<i>Be not afraid.</i>

273
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,478
<i>The forest nymphs have taught
me how to please a woman.</i>

274
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,851
That's not me! It's not me.
You can see it's not me!

275
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:30,684
He added extra scenes so he
could release it as a porno.

276
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:34,197
Be not afraid, Wilson. You
took risks for your art.

277
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,664
Oh, boy.

278
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:45,471
No one... Hey, look at me.
No one can know about this.

279
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,345
From this moment on,
my lips are sealed.

280
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,513
Sorry.
It's okay.

281
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,749
Be not afraid.

282
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,854
Find anything?

283
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:10,662
Relevant? No.
Interesting? I guess.

284
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,864
There's nothing she doesn't
share. "Angry sex is overrated.

285
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,567
"How can he expect me to be
aroused when I'm so pissed at him?"

286
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:18,939
Revelations like that might
just earn her a new kidney.

287
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,171
An hour after she blogged
about her kidney failure,

288
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,612
the hospital got
a call from Singapore.

289
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:27,117
One of Frankie's readers asking
how hard it would be to donate.

290
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,416
How good-looking am I?

291
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,886
I'm not asking
if you're attracted to me,

292
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,862
I'm looking for
an objective answer.

293
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,058
Oh, okay, then it's an
appropriate question.

294
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,227
Last night I acted like a
complete tosser to prove to House

295
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:46,100
that women don't go out
with me for my looks.

296
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,766
Cost me 100 bucks and my
definition of myself. And women.

297
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,105
So date men, they're not shallow at all.

298
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,276
Everything's physical.
Yes,

299
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,575
we are physical beings.
Some more than others.

300
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,048
Please don't define my entire
gender based on one night.

301
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,951
No. What if the patient's
problem is a physical reaction,

302
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,545
not an emotional one?

303
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,750
What if her lack of arousal had
nothing to do with their fight?

304
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:09,293
Sjogrens would inhibit
her normal secretions.

305
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:17,258
Sorry for keeping you up. I thought
it better not to wait till morning.

306
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,964
Oh, it's no problem,
I'm a night owl.

307
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:26,837
So you think I might have this Sjogrens
because of my lack of discharge?

308
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:29,641
Yes. It's lucky
you wrote about that.

309
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:32,649
And a little crazy, you're
thinking, to share that much.

310
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:37,188
Not crazy, unusual, to be so
intimate with people you don't know.

311
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:40,656
But I do know them. They read
my blog, I comment on theirs.

312
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,351
Just because you haven't
met someone physically

313
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,826
doesn't mean you
don't know them.

314
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,296
What about you?
Are you in a relationship?

315
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:48,830
It recently ended.

316
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,163
Oh, sorry.

317
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,829
Lie flat on your back,
all the way.

318
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,439
But you saw each other
every day, right?

319
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,478
How much did you tell her
about what you were thinking?

320
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:03,037
Or did you just end up talking
about where you were going to dinner

321
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:05,946
and who needed
to do the laundry?

322
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,786
Is that what your relationship
with Taylor is like?

323
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:09,946
No.

324
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,456
Well, maybe a little.

325
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,189
He's great,
but sometimes

326
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,661
it's easier to open up to
people who aren't looking at you.

327
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:21,722
You need to lie flat
for us to get the x-ray.

328
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,395
I'm actually not comfortable on
my back. Can't we do it this way?

329
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:26,664
Did you strain a muscle?

330
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:27,830
No.

331
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,098
What's wrong?

332
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,347
I've booked our patient
in for heart surgery.

333
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,683
I was doing a sialogram on her, and
she didn't want to lie on her back.

334
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,552
That's a complaint you hear from
people with heart valve issues.

335
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,751
It fits. Sjogrens
damaged her heart,

336
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,055
causing her clotting problems,
causing her kidneys to fail.

337
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,292
You based all that on the fact
that she didn't want to lie down?

338
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:57,960
That, and the cardiac echo I performed
after she didn't want to lie down.

339
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,766
Her mitral valve
is nearly gone,

340
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,569
which means
she's nearly gone.

341
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,737
God, you're pretty.

342
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:17,517
So we can replace the mitral valve
with a pig valve or with a plastic one.

343
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,523
From an actual pig?

344
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,651
It's the better choice if you
want to have children someday.

345
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,356
The plastic valve requires
you to be on anticoagulants,

346
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,022
which are known
to cause birth defects.

347
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,897
On the other hand, the pig
valve wears out quickly,

348
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,199
so you'd need to have heart
surgery again in 10 years.

349
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,231
I know that you're on the fence about
having kids, but Taylor really wants them.

350
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:41,109
It's in the blog.

351
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:45,616
I'm afraid you two will need to agree
on that decision earlier than planned.

352
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,059
It's your call.

353
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,563
Can you pass me
my laptop?

354
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,330
Seriously?
I want to get some feedback.

355
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,561
You really think that
asking strangers

356
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,969
for some off-the-top-of- their-head
response is gonna be helpful here?

357
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,007
A lot of your readers
are into animal rights.

358
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,905
They've got you two-thirds
of the way to vegan,

359
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,105
what are they gonna say about you
buying your life with the life of a pig?

360
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,045
Whatever they say,
I don't have to do it.

361
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,275
It won't work
out that way,

362
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,513
and we're the ones that are
gonna have to live with this.

363
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,984
Please, Frankie.
Don't tell them.

364
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:30,818
If I start picking and
choosing, I'm being dishonest.

365
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,929
I'm sorry.

366
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:49,944
Thanks.

367
00:21:04,963 --> 00:21:08,160
Though I guess I should thank whoever
taught you how to please a woman.

368
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:15,471
Maybe it was the
forest nymphs.

369
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:24,375
<i>Get my Vertigo
poster back.</i>

370
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,821
Be not afraid,
it's exact change.

371
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,017
Okay.

372
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,224
Hello.

373
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,556
I'm looking to get
something on House.

374
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:46,001
Couldn't you just ask the
love-nymphs for the secret?

375
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,333
Don't.

376
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:52,002
My mission is to find something that
House would not like to see made public,

377
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,669
and make it public.

378
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,942
In.

379
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,715
But you know him better than
anyone, why do you need my help?

380
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,945
House would never leave
anything secret around the condo.

381
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:05,183
But you've worked in the same office
with him, on and off, for years.

382
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:09,353
Think back. Were there ever any odd
phone calls or visitors from the past?

383
00:22:09,428 --> 00:22:11,862
He openly brings prostitutes
into the hospital,

384
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,024
and he gambles with bookies because
he's too lazy to go to the OTB,

385
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,863
and you're asking for...

386
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,203
What? What? What?

387
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,736
<i>He's reading
The Golden Bowl.</i>

388
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,402
By Henry James?

389
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:30,608
Yeah. No, he's not
really reading it.

390
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,051
Okay. I don't understand.

391
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,086
That book's at least
400 pages long,

392
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:37,121
whatever he's reading
is only half that thick.

393
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:40,453
Maybe he's reading a version
with a smaller font.

394
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,727
He's not using
his reading glasses.

395
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,387
That's a good point.

396
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,262
<i>He took the cover off The Golden
Bowl and put it onto this other book,</i>

397
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,631
so no one would know
what he was reading.

398
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,466
Whatever it is,
he's ashamed of it.

399
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,203
Huh.

400
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,973
I'm going with plastic.
It just makes more sense.

401
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,008
I don't want another
operation later.

402
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:10,145
That's not why
you're doing this.

403
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,518
Look, when you were first telling
me about why you love the Internet,

404
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,323
you said that no one
has to be alone again.

405
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,799
Whoever you are, whatever you
love, you can connect with someone.

406
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:25,365
If you want to recreate
the Boston Tea Party,

407
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,962
while dressed as
Imperial Stormtroopers,

408
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,008
you can find the 10 other people in the
world that have always wanted to do that.

409
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,974
That hasn't changed.

410
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:34,102
But you have.

411
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,974
This thing that you do, it's
not about connection anymore.

412
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:40,711
It's about an audience.
It's a performance,

413
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,219
and you've got one eye
on the number of hits.

414
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:46,787
You've turned our lives
into their entertainment.

415
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,795
You're smart, you're fun
to read, it's okay.

416
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,227
But don't give them this.

417
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,838
Or if you do,
don't expect me to be here.

418
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:16,346
It's a good cover choice. It's
not like anyone would pick it up.

419
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,389
It's Cameron's
favorite book.

420
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,924
I don't even know
what it's about.

421
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,056
Don't do that to yourself.

422
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:24,890
What the hell?

423
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:33,436
Giving him a computer is like
giving plutonium to Dr. No.

424
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,267
Got it.

425
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:42,941
<i>Sermons
for Everyday Life"?</i>

426
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:51,219
These are literal sermons,
written by a minister.

427
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,425
"Loving thy neighbor even
when thy neighbor's stereo

428
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:55,686
"is keeping you up at night. "

429
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,818
Why would he read this?

430
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:58,260
Why would he hide it?

431
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:00,297
He reads the Bible,
he reads the Koran.

432
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,629
He says he likes to know what
mistakes people are making.

433
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:05,133
You think he's sincere?

434
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:07,262
You think that he's actually
getting something out of this?

435
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:08,862
I don't know.

436
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,271
What a hypocrite.

437
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,641
How can we use this
in a cruel yet funny way?

438
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:17,738
You know what?

439
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,250
Don't mention
this to anyone.

440
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:25,414
So what was the point?

441
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:34,795
Are you going to be
here when I wake up?

442
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:43,639
I hate that you
don't have a blog,

443
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,505
I hate that I don't know
what you're thinking.

444
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,945
Let's not get
into it right now.

445
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:52,006
We need to get you
through surgery.

446
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,209
I don't want to go in there knowing
you'll stick with me through surgery

447
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,449
'cause that's what
good guys do,

448
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:00,081
but once I'm better,
you'll be gone.

449
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:02,023
Let's not get into it now.

450
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,759
It hurts.

451
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,089
Is it her heart?

452
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,429
No, it's here. Here.

453
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,203
Get her inside.

454
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:25,605
Your appendix burst.
We had to remove it.

455
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:31,145
And the biopsy confirms it was full of
abnormal cells consistent with lymphoma.

456
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,189
I have cancer?

457
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,195
We've postponed
putting in the new valve.

458
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:42,460
So, I mean, I guess we do,
what, chemo and all that stuff?

459
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:45,662
Yes, but apparently you've
had this for some time.

460
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,330
When your appendix burst,
it was like a dam giving way.

461
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,204
Those cells went streaming
throughout your body.

462
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,176
So you're saying you'll treat,
but you don't expect it to work.

463
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,873
That's why no valve.
It's pointless.

464
00:26:57,315 --> 00:27:00,614
Our Dean of Medicine has approved
an experimental treatment.

465
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:05,452
We use your unique cancer cell signature
to create a targeted lymphoma vaccine.

466
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:08,185
Okay. So that'll
cure me?

467
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:10,818
Well, we're not actually
sure what it'll do,

468
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:13,227
but the intention is to
train your immune system

469
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:16,232
to recognize and kill cells bearing
the same malignant signature,

470
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:18,131
while leaving
healthy cells alone.

471
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:22,469
But, as Dr. Foreman says,
it's experimental.

472
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,666
I see.

473
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,403
Without it, what kind of
time are we talking about?

474
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,375
An exact prognosis
is impossible.

475
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,710
How about a guess?
Something, please.

476
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:36,582
Based on people in situations
like yours, maybe a year.

477
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,026
Baby, whatever we have to do, we'll do.

478
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:47,859
I can take care of you.
I can work from home.

479
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,505
Sounds good. Thank you
for letting me know.

480
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,342
We'll start with the
treatment whenever it's ready.

481
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,783
Is she being a good
soldier or is she in denial?

482
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:10,218
Denial's not unusual
for a first reaction.

483
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:13,746
Or it could be a symptom. Some
lymphomas affect cognition.

484
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,883
If it is denial, she
needs time to process.

485
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,726
If it's a symptom, hopefully
treatment with the vaccine will help.

486
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,301
Hey, Sandy.

487
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,574
Can I borrow your car?

488
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,473
She gave me the keys.

489
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,572
You're a doctor, she
was doing you a favor.

490
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,948
She barely knows me.

491
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,715
I've been deluding myself that I'm
actually connecting with people.

492
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:53,660
The first person I ever fell in love
with turned out to be a total tool.

493
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:56,824
He came across all funny
and charming and thoughtful,

494
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,129
but it was an act.

495
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,328
He saw something
he wanted

496
00:28:59,437 --> 00:29:01,667
and he knew he had to behave
a certain way to get it.

497
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:06,472
In retrospect, the fact that I was 17
and he was 30 should've been a clue.

498
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,910
Figuring out who people are takes time.

499
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:13,679
And it takes twice as much time
if they're trying to impress you.

500
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,652
Now, I could take from this that
anyone who loans me their car

501
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,915
has an ulterior motive,

502
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,925
or I can accept that it's
just a nice thing to do,

503
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,858
and take people
as they come.

504
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:30,323
You wanna do
the first injection?

505
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,286
Why are you reading a book
by a Unitarian minister?

506
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,816
Book club. Oprah was going on and on...

507
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:55,189
I'm serious.
This is messed up.

508
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,184
A patient wrote it.
No.

509
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,526
You've never treated a patient
with this name, I looked it up.

510
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,832
It's an assignment
from my therapist.

511
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,097
No, it wasn't.

512
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:09,868
No one you respect would give you
this and expect it to be helpful.

513
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:10,963
It's a book!

514
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,441
Of sermons!

515
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,535
For anyone else,
spiritually enlightening.

516
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:17,809
For you, it's practically
a psychotic break.

517
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,155
I know that you have trouble, sometimes,

518
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:27,919
with the pain
without the Vicodin.

519
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:31,325
Is that it? Are you so out of options

520
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:34,832
you're looking for answers in
what you consider irrationality?

521
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:36,696
I'm all right. Trust me.

522
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,830
Are you all right because
you're back on Vicodin?

523
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,069
I said trust me.

524
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,705
I know this
means something.

525
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,544
You mind?
I haven't finished it yet.

526
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,365
Thanks for the gift.

527
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,902
Obviously differs from
my own personal beliefs,

528
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:18,305
but if these stories have helped
you through some spiritual turmoil...

529
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,402
Read chapter six,
entitled "Shut the hell up. "

530
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,070
I appreciated
the inscription

531
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:25,843
about the benefits of prayer
before medical treatments,

532
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,943
and I think it's great that you have
been called to witness by the Lord.

533
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,044
Chapter two, "Bite me. "

534
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,284
Hi.

535
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,864
Thirteen's giving our patient
her third vaccine injection.

536
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,228
She's responding
well so far.

537
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,460
How did you get all these
copies? It's out of print.

538
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,901
I called the author. He's got
cartons of the thing in his basement.

539
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:48,734
You called him?
What did you say?

540
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:51,639
That I knew some people who could
benefit spiritually from the book.

541
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,540
Did you mention me?

542
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,139
No, but...

543
00:31:58,816 --> 00:31:59,908
Fever's at 104.

544
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,248
The antibodies tripped
her autoimmune response.

545
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,481
The vaccine
is killing her.

546
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,050
Well, clearly
it's not working.

547
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:12,790
You have to stop
the vaccine.

548
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:15,457
Sure. Give up and let
her die on schedule.

549
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,659
It's better than
speeding up the schedule.

550
00:32:17,735 --> 00:32:19,066
How quickly did
this come on?

551
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:21,935
She was all right when I woke her this
afternoon for the second injection.

552
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,941
Of the stimulating agent, which
added to the first injection,

553
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,102
switched her immune reaction
into overdrive.

554
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,112
Why was she sleeping?

555
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:32,139
Who can sleep in a
hospital, during the daytime?

556
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,512
I'm not surprised
she's tired.

557
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,017
She's always
been a night owl.

558
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,485
Just by treating her, we've
completely disrupted her schedule.

559
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:40,284
Is that what her blog says?
She's a night owl?

560
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:41,416
No, she told me.

561
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:45,292
In what tense? Is? Was? Will have been?

562
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,325
I'm not sure.

563
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,558
What are you onto?

564
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,101
Look at the time-stamp
on this post.

565
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:53,330
2:30 a. m. Here's one at 4:00 a. m.

566
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:56,168
Whatever he's onto doesn't change
the fact that she has lymphoma

567
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:58,367
and we gave her a dangerous
vaccine. We need to...

568
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,502
Six months ago, she's
posting in the daytime.

569
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:05,814
Two years ago, daytime.
That's her natural rhythm.

570
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,441
Day-night reversal.

571
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:08,644
Sign of liver disease?

572
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,051
Which
doesn't fit lymphoma.

573
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,746
But we know
she has lymphoma.

574
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:15,519
We know she has the cell
atypia that indicates lymphoma.

575
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,222
Biopsy her liver.

576
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,569
That was pretty cool,
what I did, right?

577
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:28,764
You wanna make out?

578
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:35,437
You don't have lymphoma.

579
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,537
But you said my appendix
was full of cancer cells.

580
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:41,176
Your appendix was full of cells
that showed a lymphocytic atypia.

581
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:45,052
We now think they were a granulomatous
build-up from some unknown cause.

582
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,887
So I'm not dying?

583
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,801
You're actually dying
more quickly than we thought.

584
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:03,429
Unless we figure out what's
causing your liver failure.

585
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,112
You have three or four days.

586
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,327
What the hell do you mean
I have three or four days?

587
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,923
Well, we're past denial.

588
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,622
Maybe we didn't
cause the fever.

589
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:02,130
We gave her the vaccine and
her fever spiked, seems to me...

590
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:05,634
Yes, but it persisted after
we took her off the vaccine.

591
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,829
What if it's
a new symptom?

592
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,735
Okay, so we add
fever to cell atypia,

593
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,744
coagulopathy, kidney, heart, liver...

594
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:16,609
It has to be an infection.
But which one?

595
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,979
No one she knows is sick.
She hasn't travelled anywhere.

596
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,449
There's nothing in the history
she gave us, nothing in her blog.

597
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,749
There has to be something
unique to this infection,

598
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:26,449
something about its transmission,
the way it manifests.

599
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,856
There has to be something
she's not telling us.

600
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,125
There isn't. She's told us,
and everyone else, everything.

601
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,670
Start her on broad-
spectrum antibiotics.

602
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:47,304
Since we know everything, we
might as well treat for everything.

603
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:53,202
I picked up one of the copies of the
book that Chase left in the lounge.

604
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:55,478
If you're going
to be this way,

605
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,207
I'm not going to invite
you to my baptism.

606
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:00,341
The first time I'd seen
the real dust jacket.

607
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,876
The inside back flap, there's
a picture of the author.

608
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,288
Imagine how surprised I was
when I recognized him.

609
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,454
Your biological father
is a minister?

610
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:15,096
Natural selection
is not an infallible force.

611
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,596
I don't get it.

612
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,902
Okay, he was
a friend of the family,

613
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,908
you'd only known him
when you were a kid.

614
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,308
But if you wanted
to meet him now,

615
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:30,812
get an idea of what he's like,
why not just go talk to him?

616
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,979
"Hi, it's Greg.
You slept with my mother. "

617
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,518
You're capable of it.

618
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,119
I was mildly curious.

619
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,352
Enough to read a book, not
enough to make a phone call.

620
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:46,760
Please. You didn't read
this, you studied it. Why?

621
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,358
All your life you've
thought this was crap.

622
00:37:50,968 --> 00:37:53,334
You can't
suddenly turn around

623
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:56,703
and build a whole new
world-view based on crap.

624
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:59,173
Crap.

625
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:05,945
You better not be faking this just
to get out of a tough conversation.

626
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,655
Do you poop?

627
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,858
Come on. Everybody poops. I
read the book in medical school.

628
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,291
Sinkers or floaters?

629
00:38:22,366 --> 00:38:23,526
This is the Wizard.

630
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,694
Greasy and soft,
or hard and pellet-like?

631
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:38,247
Floaters and the first one.

632
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:43,179
You just had
to be so swoft.

633
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:47,050
You're a hypocrite,
no lies, no secrets,

634
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:48,682
but everything stops
at your colon.

635
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:51,761
Four thousand pages,
not one word about BMs.

636
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,261
And I bet yours
don't smell at all.

637
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,389
Nobody wants to hear about
that stuff. Readers don't.

638
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,831
People who don't really care
about you don't, but doctors might.

639
00:38:57,902 --> 00:39:00,097
The icky stuff changed,
right? A few months ago.

640
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,432
Well, I became
a vegetarian.

641
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,099
A lot of people misunderstand
how a vegetarian diet works.

642
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,939
You take in less unusable material,
and your waste gets more efficient,

643
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:11,173
harder and rounder. Just
look at the feces of rabbits.

644
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:13,580
Seriously, I think I might
have some. Malabsorption.

645
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,050
Her system's not retaining
the necessary nutrients.

646
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,520
A GI infection that
causes malabsorption,

647
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:20,284
granulamatous
build-up of cells.

648
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,723
It's not contagious, 'cause
no one around her got sick.

649
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:24,954
Whipple's Disease.

650
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:29,263
Let's split the credit.
Start her on cotrimoxazole.

651
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,632
We all need some secrets.

652
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:36,537
So long as they don't kill us,
they keep us safe and warm.

653
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,568
I'm...

654
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,807
I'm gonna be okay?

655
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,373
You'll still need
a new heart valve,

656
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:51,979
and you'll be on meds for a few years,
but basically, yeah, your odds are good.

657
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:09,804
Thank God.

658
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,176
I think I wanna go
with the pig valve.

659
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,124
I know you'll go crazy
if you don't tell people.

660
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,461
Thank God
you're an enabler.

661
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:44,374
Do you think people can
actually know each other better

662
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,067
on the Internet
than face-to-face?

663
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,543
Faces can be
distracting,

664
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:52,047
but there's nothing better
than looking into someone's eyes

665
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,741
and everything
that goes with that.

666
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:58,652
I don't know. People meet,
they like something superficial,

667
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:01,316
and then they fill in the blanks
with whatever they want to believe.

668
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:02,916
Why are you
so hung up on this?

669
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:06,588
I refuse to believe it's all because
you just noticed you have a nice face.

670
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,289
I mean, you just
came off a relationship,

671
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:11,732
you know things
go deeper than...

672
00:41:13,938 --> 00:41:17,101
Is that what this is
about? You and Cameron?

673
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:21,701
I was the one
that pursued her.

674
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:25,445
Maybe I was just filling
in the blanks, maybe...

675
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:28,683
Maybe her first
reaction was right.

676
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:31,118
We were just two people
who were in proximity

677
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,349
and found each other attractive,
and I never should have...

678
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:37,588
Paranoia. You felt
something real. So did she.

679
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:40,394
Don't try to take
it back now.

680
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,534
Can I borrow your car?

681
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,062
No.

682
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,372
Why would it make more sense for
you to read your father's book

683
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,643
than to go talk with him?

684
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,583
Can you write a book, so
I can stop talking to you?

685
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:12,455
You weren't looking
for some big catharsis,

686
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,895
you didn't want
to hug the guy.

687
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:17,331
You just wanted to know how
his head works, how he thinks.

688
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,959
Because I'm fascinated
with how ministers think.

689
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,970
Because you're not
ordinary, House.

690
00:42:22,072 --> 00:42:23,937
You're way out there
on the fringe somewhere.

691
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:27,273
I'm your best friend, and half
the time I don't understand you.

692
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:30,609
You're alone, you've been
alone your whole life.

693
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,850
When you read that book you
were hoping that somewhere,

694
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,684
underneath all that talk of God,
there would be a way of thinking,

695
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,758
a mind that you
could recognize.

696
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:44,020
You wanted
what we all want.

697
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,688
The power to transform
into any water-based object?

698
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,858
To look across the gulf and know
there's someone else like you.

699
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:55,795
At least tell me this, did
you find something there?

700
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,302
Underneath the God stuff,

701
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,636
more God stuff.

702
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,778
Get maintenance
to take that down.
