1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:04,765
So, I'm thinking 35.

2
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,328
Seems high to me.

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:09,569
Uh-huh. That's a fair
price for quality like this.

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,302
I'll give you 30.

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,713
What?
I thought you were joking.

6
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,253
Who am I dealing with
here, Eddie? Him or you?

7
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,948
Mickey, relax.

8
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,050
Now, if things move forward with
Gorski, he lets us into Philly,

9
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,685
then maybe
I cut you a break.

10
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:32,095
You cut me a break now or
maybe you don't get with Gorski.

11
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:39,571
Marco, I thought we
had an understanding.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,129
Whoa, whoa.

13
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:44,176
Tommy, don't be stupid.
Put the gun down.

14
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:45,836
First, he shows you
some respect.

15
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:49,075
All right, just listen to
your boss, all right, moron?

16
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,480
Shut up.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,949
Just relax, buddy,
all right?

18
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:00,885
What the hell
are you thinking?

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,052
I didn't shoot him.

20
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:03,959
You sure? Look at him, he's
face down in the pavement.

21
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,225
I nailed myself
in the foot!

22
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,495
I don't think he's hit.

23
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,561
Well, then,
what happened?

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,301
Let's get out of here.

25
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:19,606
Come on, Mickey, wake up.
Mickey! Wake up!

26
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,239
We almost done here?

27
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:01,310
Assuming you did this
shaving your forehead.

28
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:03,850
Okay, then.
I'm ordering a head CT.

29
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,891
No, I don't
have a headache,

30
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,189
I'm not dizzy.
Eddie, I gotta get back.

31
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,819
You gotta stay here.

32
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,091
We'll straighten out that
mess with Marco tomorrow.

33
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,564
Let the doc do his job.

34
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,831
Actually, stitching you up
is really the ER doc's job.

35
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,702
Yeah.
Too long of a wait.

36
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:24,038
Yeah. Also, a lot
of cops in the ER.

37
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,537
Not that you'd
care about that.

38
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:29,514
So, how did this happen?

39
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,354
Yeah, you're right.
It's a stupid question

40
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,616
'cause the answer's
kind of obvious.

41
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,284
No scrapes on your hands means
you didn't try to break your fall,

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,351
means you were
either out cold

43
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:44,794
or totally disoriented
when you went down.

44
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,661
No sign of trauma,
other than the cut,

45
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,633
means no one hit you
in the head.

46
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:53,104
And powder burn on your jacket
sleeve means someone shot a gun.

47
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:58,038
All right, Eddie.
Come on, let's go.

48
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,636
I don't care what
you guys are into.

49
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:04,114
If you don't get this checked
out, it'll happen again.

50
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,740
What will?

51
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:07,308
This.

52
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,254
Cool.

53
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:20,994
Thirty-two-year-old man recently
developed loud-noise-induced vertigo.

54
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,501
CT was clean, no internal
bleeding, no edema.

55
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,936
Everything else
is in the file.

56
00:03:26,005 --> 00:03:28,337
Cameron get your hair
in the divorce?

57
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,273
This guy strained his
back three years ago

58
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,435
and that's it.

59
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:32,944
All the rest of
these pages are blank.

60
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,207
Yes, he won't
tell us anything.

61
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,579
Understandable,
since he's a drug dealer.

62
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:40,953
So he's dangerous
and withholding,

63
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,385
which you find
irresistible.

64
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,946
But guys like that,
they never call.

65
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:47,356
He actually said
he was a drug dealer?

66
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,519
Not out loud.

67
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,859
But he was wearing a
solid-gold Patek Philippe,

68
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,388
his friend had a Rolex, but
their phones were prepaid burners,

69
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,697
so they can toss them
as soon as they're done.

70
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,964
It doesn't matter if this
guy's a drug dealer or not.

71
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,063
Noise-induced vertigo
means ear or brain.

72
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,574
Head CT was clean, so I'm
thinking acoustic neuroma.

73
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,372
We need to do an ABR
to test his hearing.

74
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,575
Acoustic neuroma fits, so does
lidocaine toxicity or benzocaine,

75
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,583
depends what he's
cutting the coke with.

76
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,051
So now he's not just a drug
dealer, he's a cocaine dealer.

77
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,883
He seemed peppy.

78
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:18,219
You test his ears, I'm
gonna go test his cocaine.

79
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,781
You think this guy is
just going to hand over

80
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,260
a briefcase full of illegal
drugs because you ask nicely?

81
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,694
I hope not.

82
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:31,559
So, the best coffee's
at Geena's

83
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:33,765
and the best pizza
is at Gino's.

84
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,330
Yeah, and don't
mix those up,

85
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,002
'cause the coffee at Gino's
could kill you.

86
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,669
And how's the dry cleaner
on the corner?

87
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,304
Go two blocks
over to EcoClean,

88
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,010
the one on the corner used to
shred all my boyfriend's shirts.

89
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:46,346
Good to know.
In retrospect,

90
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,047
I should really
thank those cleaners.

91
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,815
We broke up.
This is my stop.

92
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,688
So if you have
any more questions

93
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,194
about the neighborhood,
I'm your girl.

94
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:59,891
Uh, favorite sushi place? Maybe
we could get dinner sometime.

95
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,298
Sure, if you promise
to bring

96
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,165
that good-looking guy
with the cane.

97
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,168
You mean House?

98
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:08,139
Your boyfriend's name
is House?

99
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,641
He's not my boyfriend.

100
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:12,837
Oh.

101
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,306
I'm sorry. What do
you call each other?

102
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:19,044
Husband?
Partner? Lover?

103
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,486
We're not gay.

104
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,954
Seriously?

105
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,789
You're going to hear a
series of clicks and hisses.

106
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,626
The sensors measure electronic
activity to your auditory nerve.

107
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,427
How long is
this gonna take?

108
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,195
An hour, maybe
an hour-and-a-half.

109
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,397
Or you could walk away
with a tumor in your ear.

110
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,837
Guy's probably late
to a stabbing.

111
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,502
Impedances look good,

112
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:49,036
starting at 13 clicks
per second at 50 decibels.

113
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,707
Check this out.

114
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,947
Thirteen's middle name
is Beauregard?

115
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,384
Wave 3 latency is 3.8.

116
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,153
Slightly delayed,
but nothing significant.

117
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,750
That's what
sticks out to you?

118
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,888
House is clearly screwing
with us. It's a fake pay stub.

119
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,192
Looks real to me.

120
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,823
There's no way
she makes that much money.

121
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,800
I make that much money.

122
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,438
And apparently,
you don't.

123
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:18,072
I need the drugs.

124
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,440
We're in textiles.

125
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,344
I need the drugs!

126
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:24,507
Hmm.

127
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,017
Works for Jack Bauer.

128
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,315
Is this really necessary?

129
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,049
The chairs in the hall
are way more comfortable.

130
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,422
But way less
genre-appropriate.

131
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,259
Okay, here's the deal.

132
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:36,420
I need information.

133
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,259
You have reasons not to
give me that information.

134
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,891
So either I can
force it out of you

135
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,867
or I can't.

136
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:47,104
I wish I could tell you.

137
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:50,434
Okay. Well,
let's work with that.

138
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,204
Forget the drugs,
let's talk about textiles.

139
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,440
What's your
major product?

140
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:59,815
Is it H? And by that
I mean hosiery.

141
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,885
We deal more
with culottes.

142
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,253
Is that with
a "C" or a "K"?

143
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,054
"C." Nobody wants K
any more.

144
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,357
Does your friend
cut the fabric?

145
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,421
No, he's a sales guy.

146
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,466
Well, he must cut a culotte
here and there.

147
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:17,560
No one touches
the culottes.

148
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:22,634
Sorry. Can I talk
to you for a second?

149
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,911
I'm interrogating a suspect.
Make it quick.

150
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,451
Everyone in our building
thinks we're gay.

151
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:40,158
We're grown men, over the age
of 30, who moved in together.

152
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,592
We're two tigers away
from an act in Vegas.

153
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,493
They'll figure out we're
straight, eventually.

154
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,692
"Eventually" is not when I want
to go out with the cute girl in 3B.

155
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,031
Any chance I could get
some water over here?

156
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,535
If only there was
some way

157
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,765
to communicate that
information to her,

158
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,104
perhaps using,
I don't know, sounds.

159
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,870
If only the larynx
was capable of...

160
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,573
She didn't believe me. She
sidestepped my dinner invite.

161
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,843
And a woman would only reject
you because she's worried

162
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,441
you might not be
interested in her.

163
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,986
We were chatting,
having fun,

164
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:09,351
there was
definitely a spark.

165
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,720
When she thought
you were gay.

166
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,725
You sure your friend
isn't secretly trying...

167
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,351
What is a culotte,
anyway?

168
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,022
They're pants that
hang like a skirt.

169
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,661
Just...

170
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,999
Mickey hates the stuff.

171
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,766
He's one of
the few guys I trust

172
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:29,603
to watch
the product overnight.

173
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,577
They took him away
an hour ago.

174
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:33,669
You think he's okay?

175
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,579
It's an ear test. I'm
pretty sure he'll live.

176
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,377
Pupils are constricted.
Pulse is bounding.

177
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,855
Airway's clear. We need
a crash cart in here.

178
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:45,982
It's gotta be
his blood pressure.

179
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,049
We need to get it down
before he strokes out.

180
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:50,595
At least we know
his ears are okay.

181
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,157
We put the patient
on vasodilators,

182
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,702
got his hypertension
under control.

183
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,169
He got worse here
at the hospital,

184
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,207
means thug life probably
isn't what's making him sick.

185
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,937
<i>Which means we can stop
The Bloodhound Gang routine</i>

186
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:06,410
and go back
to being doctors.

187
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:09,846
But we're doctors all
the time. It's so boring.

188
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,776
Fine.

189
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,876
Could be sick
sinus syndrome.

190
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,716
No chest pain,
shortness of breath.

191
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,586
Brain aneurysm secondary
to polycystic kidney disease?

192
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:22,958
Normal urinalysis, kidneys
impalpable. Is that a new watch?

193
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,225
I thought I'd give
myself a little treat.

194
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,425
What if it's
not his brain,

195
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,967
but it's on the way
to his brain?

196
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,730
Carotid stenosis.

197
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,668
Get an ultrasound
of his carotids,

198
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:35,536
see if his arteries
are clogged.

199
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,014
How much money
do you make?

200
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:47,983
I want a raise.

201
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,113
And I will be happy
to talk about that

202
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,714
at your next review,
in August.

203
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,157
I know that you're
paying me less

204
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,285
than everyone else
on the team.

205
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,330
I can't discuss other people's
salaries. You know that.

206
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,591
Now that they know
I'm making less

207
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,064
than they are,
they'll never respect me.

208
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,533
And who told them
how much you make?

209
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,870
It's not fair for me to make
less than the people I supervise.

210
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,873
Salary isn't
about fairness.

211
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,375
It's about what you can
leverage in a negotiation,

212
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,743
which isn't much without a
competing offer on the table.

213
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,339
And we both know
you don't have one.

214
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:24,178
Ultrasound showed no narrowing or
obstruction in the patient's carotid.

215
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,349
Not that he's worried, keeps
asking when he can leave.

216
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,325
<i>A place in the business
of healing people,</i>

217
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,725
<i>you'd think they'd
have better chicken soup.</i>

218
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:30,887
You bugged his room?

219
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,430
Our patient sleeps
in the building

220
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,193
where they keep
their stash.

221
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,494
Eventually,
he'll say something

222
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,559
that gives away
where that is.

223
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,104
Then we'll find out
what's making him sick.

224
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,934
But we ruled out
environmental causes.

225
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,474
You ruled out
environmental causes.

226
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:44,702
And you
pretended to agree

227
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,540
just so we'd take
him out of his room

228
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,045
so you could
plant the bug.

229
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,446
Carotid stenosis
was a decent idea.

230
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,984
But an even
decent-er idea is that

231
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,917
he's got toxins stored
in his fat cells.

232
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,750
Every calorie he burns
makes him sicker.

233
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,722
If we're going
with toxic exposure,

234
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,726
we should just start testing
for the most likely suspects.

235
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:04,661
Bug's a better idea than
blindly running tests for days.

236
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,659
Tell him
it'll take weeks.

237
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,862
It'll be faster.

238
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,434
What do you mean,
weeks?

239
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,203
These tests take time, there
are a lot of possibilities.

240
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,870
I can't sit here
this long.

241
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:21,412
I got things
I gotta take care of.

242
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,710
If you're worried about
all the poor schoolchildren

243
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:25,307
going without
their drugs,

244
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,410
I'm sure someone...
I want to be discharged.

245
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,151
I'll get the forms.

246
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,696
This is ridiculous.

247
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,137
Beats sitting
in a lab all day.

248
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,970
In the lab,
there is significantly

249
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,737
less chance of
getting killed.

250
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,903
You're too close,
slow down.

251
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:55,071
We're in a car in broad
daylight, what's gonna happen?

252
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,876
You honestly think he doesn't
have a gun in that car?

253
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,280
That he's gonna use
to shoot doctors?

254
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,513
Just back off.

255
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:06,557
Hey, well played with
the watch, by the way.

256
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,922
Borrowed it
from a friend.

257
00:12:07,993 --> 00:12:09,654
How much longer are we
gonna keep lying to him?

258
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,720
Until it's no longer fun.

259
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:15,227
We all thought he needed to
be taken down a few notches.

260
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,395
So, we're just having fun,
not getting even?

261
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:20,127
Oh, crap.

262
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,230
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

263
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,070
He's gonna get away.

264
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,581
Shut up.

265
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,821
3B. You're Nora, right?

266
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,687
My roommate tells me
you're the one to thank

267
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,198
for all the tips about
the neighborhood. Greg.

268
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,893
Nice to meet you.

269
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,332
I hear you thought
that Wilson and I liked

270
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,998
to polish
each other's swords.

271
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,071
And by swords,
I mean pistols.

272
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:00,236
Of course
he told you about that.

273
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,975
Don't worry. Actually, I'm surprised
that it doesn't happen more often.

274
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:05,812
We're both straight.

275
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:17,989
Oh, my God,
that is beautiful.

276
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,760
We finally have the room to
display it the way it deserves.

277
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,799
Would you help me
get this upstairs?

278
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,237
Absolutely.

279
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,411
Nice shoes, by the way.
Louboutins?

280
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,371
Did you talk
to Cuddy?

281
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:36,937
Shot me down.

282
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,415
So, what are you
going to do now?

283
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,951
I'll wait for
my review in August.

284
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,281
Oh.

285
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,221
What?

286
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,522
Nothing. That's what I
would do. But I'm a coward.

287
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,265
His friend brought
him in 15 minutes ago.

288
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,703
Temp's 105,
pulse is weak and thready.

289
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,434
He's not making
any sense.

290
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,805
It's too much money,
Eddie.

291
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,367
That wasn't the deal.
That wasn't the deal.

292
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,537
Is he gonna be okay?

293
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:08,637
Eddie!

294
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,313
We gave him anti-pyretics
and soft steroids

295
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,083
to reduce the fever
and prevent organ damage.

296
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,454
He's no longer
delirious.

297
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,390
Patient went out, came
back worse than before.

298
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,724
Points us back to environmental,
tied to wherever he went.

299
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,286
No, it doesn't.

300
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,025
Where's Foreman? He had
a meeting with Cuddy.

301
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,396
What do you mean,
no, it doesn't?

302
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,458
We screwed up the tail,
my car was impounded.

303
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,731
True, amusing,
and irrelevant.

304
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:36,264
Foreman fall for
the pay check thing?

305
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,473
Yeah.

306
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:43,407
<i>Mazel tov.
Should be fun to watch.</i>

307
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,575
You're off environmental?
Wherever he went,

308
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:47,846
it wasn't
for long enough.

309
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,945
Add in the fever and
infection's way more likely.

310
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:51,546
And if it is
an infection,

311
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,685
his symptoms suggest it's moved
to his brain, which means...

312
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,488
We'll do
a lumbar puncture.

313
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,197
Next time you're tailing
someone, take two cars.

314
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,163
You knew we were
following you?

315
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,069
I'm sorry,
had to lose you.

316
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:13,907
I had business
to take care of.

317
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,343
Right, because
you're a businessman.

318
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,940
You know how many junkies
come into the ER

319
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,485
every week with
their brains melting?

320
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:23,544
I bet there's more drunks
with their livers giving out,

321
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,283
but a liquor store owner
laying on this table,

322
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:26,984
I'm guessing he doesn't
get attitude.

323
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,917
I hit bone.

324
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,122
His old back injury must
have flattened out his discs.

325
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,392
Sorry, but I've got
to try this again.

326
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:35,956
Are you okay?
Yeah.

327
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,400
An adult wants
to get wasted,

328
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,199
why is it anybody's business
what substance they use?

329
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,298
Because some of those
substances are against the law.

330
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:46,242
So your problem isn't
that it's immoral,

331
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:48,473
your problem is
that it's illegal.

332
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:52,974
I got the same problem.

333
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,314
I'm in.

334
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,048
Look at his heart rate.

335
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,922
It's normal.
I know.

336
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,264
I ran into Nora
this morning.

337
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,895
<i>She told me about your
Evita listening party.</i>

338
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:16,773
The London and New York
recordings are so different.

339
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:19,367
You were supposed to tell
her that we're straight.

340
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,640
She didn't
believe me either.

341
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,045
You're doing this
to mess with me.

342
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,675
Correction. I started
doing this to mess with you.

343
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,912
Now I'm honestly
trying to hit that.

344
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,081
By pretending you're gay and
in a relationship with me?

345
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,886
We're in a relationship,
but we're really unhappy.

346
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,324
Communication's
never been easy for us,

347
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:37,123
probably because
we're so closeted.

348
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,390
I've got it all
figured out.

349
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,126
Nora and I spend the next
few weeks hanging out,

350
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,795
become best girlfriends, I
confide in her about our issues.

351
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,307
I can't decide if this plan is
more despicable or illogical.

352
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,208
Then one night,
we get drunk,

353
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:55,974
backrub turns into a front
rub, and the next morning,

354
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,107
"I've never felt this way
about a woman before. "

355
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,651
That's quite
a commitment you've made

356
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,153
to jumping the girl
I'd like to date.

357
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,814
I'd like to date her.

358
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,983
In the sense that I'd like
to jump her repeatedly.

359
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,287
I saw her first.

360
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,158
Seriously? You're invoking the Guy Code?

361
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,858
We're guys.
It's a code.

362
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:15,160
You're only
bringing this up

363
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,599
'cause you know
you're going to lose.

364
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:18,961
It's not an infection,

365
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,905
but it might be an
autonomic nerve disorder.

366
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,669
The hair's
still bumping me.

367
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:26,142
Did you get it cut because you're
ready for the next chapter or...

368
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,009
We stuck a needle into
his spinal bodies, twice,

369
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,605
his heart rate
stayed normal.

370
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,582
If we add that to
his other symptoms...

371
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,881
That would be a mistake.

372
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,652
She's never
gonna fall for it.

373
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,487
Well, then, you've got nothing
to worry about, sweetie.

374
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,921
You're a wuss.

375
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,591
Say that when I'm better.

376
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:52,796
What, are you gonna beat me
up? That sounds stressful.

377
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:56,363
Maybe you should pop one
of your beta-blockers first.

378
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,205
You have a heart problem?

379
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,837
Medically, no. He would've
told us about that.

380
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,471
Metaphorically...

381
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,023
It's an effect from
operating outside of the law.

382
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,121
Sometimes,
I have to do bad things,

383
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,598
and not always
to bad people.

384
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,259
Last few months,
that hasn't been so easy.

385
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:30,602
A guy got me the pills,
and they control the stress.

386
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:34,203
Look, don't say anything
to Eddie, all right?

387
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,248
Last thing I need is the guys
thinking that I've gone soft.

388
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:40,114
When was your last pill before
we originally admitted you?

389
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:42,949
Um... The night before.

390
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,888
Then we stuck you in here and you
went into beta-blocker withdrawal.

391
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,448
That's what caused
the hypertension.

392
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,084
When he got out of here,
he took another pill,

393
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,423
and the hypertension
went away,

394
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,724
which means
it was never a symptom.

395
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,698
We take that off the table,
we've got vertigo, fever...

396
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,462
And stress. He's been
in this game for a while,

397
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:59,800
either he grew a conscience
over the last few months,

398
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,432
or he's producing
excess adrenaline.

399
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,968
Pheochromocytoma.

400
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,305
What?
That's Greek for

401
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,575
"you'll be back doing bad things
to good people in no time. "

402
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,242
MRI his adrenal glands.
You're okay with that, right?

403
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,376
You're not gonna put
a pillow over his face?

404
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:22,894
Oh, great,
the cable guy came.

405
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,657
Hello.

406
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,863
Hi, James. We've got some Kung Pao left.

407
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,868
Oh, God.
Right there.

408
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,568
We're having a picnic.

409
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,135
With wine.

410
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,544
I'll pour you a glass.

411
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:43,638
He doesn't drink.

412
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:44,739
Oh.

413
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,443
More for us then.

414
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,819
Well,

415
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:57,386
I think I might
have a little Kung Pao.

416
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,332
How did it go
with Cuddy?

417
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,373
She told me
I needed leverage,

418
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,879
so I told her
about an offer

419
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,348
I had to help run the
neuro department at Mercy.

420
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:20,576
Wow.

421
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,615
Are you really
gonna take the job?

422
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,714
There is no other job.

423
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,952
I bluffed,
she called it.

424
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,017
I'm not gonna beg
to be underpaid.

425
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:33,387
I'm leaving when
this case is over.

426
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,834
House is lying to you.

427
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:40,164
I know.

428
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:41,833
And so are you.

429
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:46,139
It's 2010. I mean, nobody
cares if you're gay any more.

430
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:47,269
I mean, you don't have
to be in the closet.

431
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,744
I'm not.

432
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,979
Look around you.
Does this really

433
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,178
look like a place
gay men live?

434
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,245
Apart from the poster.

435
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,256
Those stools are
our only furniture.

436
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,485
There are no
window treatments.

437
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,960
My ex-boyfriend didn't even
know what window treatments were.

438
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,192
Is that Greg's Carpenters
album, or yours?

439
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:13,397
Look, House hates musicals
and fashion and meringue.

440
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:17,966
This whole thing is an act
designed to earn your trust

441
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,605
in order
to sleep with you.

442
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:25,480
I get it.
Finally.

443
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,108
You're jealous.

444
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:32,987
If you want to spend more time
with Greg, you should just tell him.

445
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,618
You were wrong.

446
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,257
MRI revealed no sign
of a pheochromocytoma,

447
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,164
which means Mickey's
stress is just stress.

448
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,395
We're back to
vertigo and fever.

449
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,801
And environmental is back at
the top of our list of suspects.

450
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,237
We're trying to narrow
down the possibilities.

451
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,935
That receiver doesn't
respond to manual stimulation.

452
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,169
Maybe if you took off
your shirt...

453
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,508
Actually, I've resorted to
something more exotic.

454
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,672
I call it reading
the instructions.

455
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:00,206
Turns out, if you screw the
antennae into the wrong sockets,

456
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:02,310
it doesn't actually work.

457
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,418
We lost Mickey just
outside of Trenton.

458
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,964
It's supposed to search
for an open frequency.

459
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,967
Most buildings there were
built between 1920 and 1940.

460
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,502
We compiled a list of
toxins most common...

461
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,562
There's got to be at
least one open frequency.

462
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:30,507
I need a few minutes
with your friend.

463
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,313
Or stay if you want.

464
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,250
Rectal exam.

465
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,550
I'll check out
the cafeteria.

466
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,897
Why the beta-blockers?

467
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:50,793
What do you mean?

468
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:54,635
Valium or Xanax
actually reduce stress.

469
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,435
Beta-blockers just control
the symptoms of stress...

470
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:57,532
Whoa.

471
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,873
...keep the heart from racing,
hands from shaking,

472
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,140
and all those
stage fright issues.

473
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,149
That's why some people
take them when they

474
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,479
perform.

475
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,577
What the hell is that?

476
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:11,246
This is my bug.

477
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:12,881
And this...

478
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,189
This...

479
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:18,452
This is yours.

480
00:23:20,665 --> 00:23:24,658
You bugged your own room?
Are you an informant?

481
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,931
An informant would've
sold his pals out to us

482
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,632
at the first sign
of a sniffle.

483
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,039
This guy is a cop.

484
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,607
I don't see
how this is relevant.

485
00:23:39,684 --> 00:23:44,087
In the land of No Fun, you got a
really sensible piece of property.

486
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,748
Give him a break.

487
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:48,325
Knowing this guy's
an undercover cop

488
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:49,826
doesn't get us
any closer to curing him.

489
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,522
Good point.
You know what they say,

490
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,394
information is
not power. Wait.

491
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,264
You're saying we should use the
cop thing to force him to talk.

492
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:00,998
Force? I'm talking about the
womanly art of persuasion.

493
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:03,397
I said womanly.

494
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,048
If you won't talk to us,
we'll find someone who will.

495
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,646
I mean, you must have
a supervisor, a handler.

496
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:21,180
Good luck with that. You
don't know my real name.

497
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,854
You don't know if I'm
local or state, FBI, DEA,

498
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,898
but by all means,
get on the phone.

499
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,592
I get it.
These guys are lowlifes,

500
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,998
you want them
off the street.

501
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,798
Look,
they're not just lowlifes.

502
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:35,237
Eddie killed a snitch
three weeks ago.

503
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,541
Boss's orders.

504
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,538
The boss,
he's one of the biggest

505
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,446
cocaine importers
in the entire state.

506
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,178
And he wants to
expand down to Philly.

507
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:51,621
Tomorrow night, he and Eddie
are meeting the big fish,

508
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,487
and the cops
are gonna bust it.

509
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:56,152
But if you guys get caught
poking around there,

510
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:58,992
the whole thing
gets called off.

511
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:02,932
That's noble, but you
can't put your life at risk.

512
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,663
I've been undercover
for 16 months.

513
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:12,036
I haven't seen my wife,
my house, my dog.

514
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,639
I've put far too much
into this,

515
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:17,546
and I will not
let it fail.

516
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,977
So, just...

517
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:25,386
Just keep me alive
for another 24 hours

518
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,722
and I will tell you
everything you need to know.

519
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,360
Hey. Can I come in?

520
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:37,094
Nurses out here can't keep
their hands off of me.

521
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,032
Casanova, huh?

522
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:43,940
You bring me my sandwich?

523
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:48,673
No, because, guess what,
I don't read minds.

524
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,513
You okay?

525
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:01,316
He had a GI infarction
caused by a clot

526
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,418
in his superior
mesenteric artery.

527
00:26:03,495 --> 00:26:04,894
We had to remove
a foot of bowel.

528
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,761
Any more clots keep forming,
he may not last 24 hours.

529
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,697
And the moron
still won't talk.

530
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,861
Bad guy, cool,
good guy, moron?

531
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,029
Pretty much.

532
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,264
Guy's a hero.

533
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,307
He's risking his life to
put these dealers in jail.

534
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:17,705
Well, I'm sure
the dealers

535
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,244
who take their places
will be very grateful.

536
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,008
So, vertigo, fever,
and thrombosis.

537
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,072
We already ruled out
cancer and infection.

538
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,142
He got worse on steroids, which
suggests it's not autoimmune.

539
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,948
So we're stuck
with environmental.

540
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,488
But what kind of
environmentals?

541
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,456
Toxins? Parasites?
Allergens?

542
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,153
We should just pick the top 10
possibilities and treat for all of them.

543
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,558
Except that treating
for everything could

544
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,597
kill him faster than
whatever's killing him.

545
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:40,722
Got a better idea?

546
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,788
Sort of.

547
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,356
Chase is right,
our patient's holding out

548
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,403
for noble reasons,
protecting his bust.

549
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,960
Anybody else in
that crew got sick,

550
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,905
I'm guessing they'd be
a little more self-serving.

551
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,841
Thanks.

552
00:26:58,216 --> 00:27:01,447
Surgery went well. You'll
be able to see him soon.

553
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:07,752
Used to be all about
Ferberizing your kid,

554
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:09,555
now they're saying
it could mess them up.

555
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:13,763
Mine's six-and-a-half.

556
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,833
Mickey's getting worse.

557
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:19,527
The clot is
a very bad sign.

558
00:27:19,604 --> 00:27:22,004
We really need you to
tell us where he's been.

559
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,505
I do that,

560
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:29,035
a very good chance that I could
end up John Doe at the county ME.

561
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,981
Look, Mickey got sick because
he had the most exposure.

562
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,213
Other guys are at risk,
too, you don't want to...

563
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:37,177
Are you okay?

564
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,114
I feel dizzy.

565
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:41,522
Are you diabetic?

566
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:42,885
No.

567
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,690
When was the last time
you were at your office?

568
00:27:44,763 --> 00:27:45,787
Whoa.

569
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:47,855
Did you drug me?
What?

570
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,695
You're trying to make
me think that I'm sick

571
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:52,396
so I'll take you
to the stash.

572
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,199
Of course not,
but if you are sick...

573
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:57,207
I don't feel sick,
I feel drugged.

574
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,641
Trust me,
I know the difference.

575
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,073
You didn't even
drink half of it,

576
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,140
you'll be fine
in an hour.

577
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:08,310
You think Mickey
could die?

578
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,482
It's just a deal.

579
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,385
I'll take you.

580
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,494
You couldn't have
given us a heads up

581
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,197
that he was living
in a dry cleaner?

582
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:28,933
It's like living
in a vat of poison.

583
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,202
Is that it?
Can we get out of here?

584
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,368
I've got to
cover all our bases.

585
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,777
Okay, fine, look.
Back there. Hurry up.

586
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:54,689
What are these? More
chemicals? Not exactly.

587
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,191
If this stuff
was the problem,

588
00:28:57,268 --> 00:28:58,496
there would be
a lot more sick people.

589
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,598
Did you call the cops?

590
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:04,664
No.

591
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,141
No one's supposed
to be here.

592
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:10,914
Come here.

593
00:29:10,982 --> 00:29:12,381
I said no kissing.

594
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,975
Eddie, I didn't know
you'd be here.

595
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:17,881
Look, the deal
was just for you.

596
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:20,720
This guy wants to watch,
it's an extra 50.

597
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:24,985
Yeah, private party, man.
I got it covered tonight.

598
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,174
Nice.

599
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:45,474
The jealousy
is killing me.

600
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,574
Well,

601
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:49,743
he clearly cares
about you very much.

602
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:53,279
Why can't he show it
in a normal way?

603
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:58,394
I'm so tired of all the
silence and the resentment.

604
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:01,922
I don't know if I can
go back there tonight.

605
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:06,229
I need some time.

606
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,239
Come stay at my place.

607
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:12,767
Really?

608
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,038
Mmm-hmm.

609
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,544
It'll be fun,
like a sleepover.

610
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:25,114
That would be such a help.
Thank you.

611
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:27,251
House.

612
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,721
What are you doing here?

613
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,354
I'm here because...

614
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:37,861
Nothing you can say is
going to change anything.

615
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:48,636
I love this man.

616
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:54,784
And I am not wasting another
moment of my life denying that.

617
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,525
Gregory House,

618
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,088
will you marry me?

619
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,291
Wow.

620
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,527
This is unexpected.

621
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,668
Say yes.

622
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,241
I'm going to go.
No, no, no.

623
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:26,306
You two obviously have some
talking to do. Excuse me.

624
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,256
How's it coming?

625
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,527
So far, nothing.

626
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:47,162
Carpet, paint, insulation, even
the gross food in the fridge,

627
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,262
everything's
coming up clean.

628
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,364
Which leaves
the dry-cleaning chemicals.

629
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:51,669
Should have the results
in a few minutes.

630
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:55,235
Foreman's already started
him on inhaled albuterol.

631
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,508
Chances are
this case is over.

632
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,413
We have to tell him.
We can't tell him.

633
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,042
It won't change the fact
that Cuddy let him walk.

634
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,111
It'll just let him know it was
all because of a stupid prank.

635
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:08,689
We have to tell Cuddy. We confess
and beg her to take him back.

636
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,628
If begging worked, he would have
a raise and we wouldn't be screwed.

637
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:14,221
Albuterol's not helping,

638
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,596
patient started
coughing blood.

639
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:18,158
What about adding
ipratropium? That might...

640
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,430
Don't bother.

641
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:22,200
We assumed this place
was using perchloroethylene.

642
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,833
Turns out,
petroleum solvents.

643
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,374
The drug dealers are
running a green dry cleaner.

644
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,004
I hate to
push past the irony,

645
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,912
but our patient's
bleeding into his lungs

646
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,473
and we've got nothing.

647
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:41,389
<i>The VIQ scan last night
showed a pulmonary aneurysm.</i>

648
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,824
Explains the coughing blood.

649
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,158
Did an embolization
and stopped the bleeding,

650
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:48,687
but then it started up again this
morning. Three more aneurysms.

651
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,768
These look like
mycotic aneurysms,

652
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,234
indicates
a fungal infection.

653
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:54,931
That'd be consistent with his other
symptoms, the vertigo, the fever...

654
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,497
I didn't see any fungus at the
location, and none of the samples...

655
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,805
Looks like somebody
missed something,

656
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,072
which is embarrassing
for somebody.

657
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,080
And the steroids
we gave him would

658
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,672
have suppressed
his immune system.

659
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:09,049
If that was a fungus,
he'd have 30 aneurysms.

660
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,147
Somebody's got
a good point.

661
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:15,158
One bleed to four in less than 12
hours seems like an uptake to me.

662
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:16,887
We need to start him
on antifungal meds

663
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,725
before he drowns
in his own blood.

664
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,328
Do it.

665
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,367
How long till it
starts working?

666
00:33:27,438 --> 00:33:30,703
Give it a few hours. I'll
be back to check on you.

667
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,185
There you go.
Take it easy.

668
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,738
You shouldn't have taken
her there, you imbecile.

669
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,501
They found nothing,

670
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:07,339
and you could've got
your brains blown out.

671
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:11,781
I had to do something. I
couldn't just sit and watch and...

672
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,383
You're my friend.

673
00:34:22,927 --> 00:34:24,121
Thanks.

674
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:28,760
You'd do it for me.

675
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:32,394
Ah!

676
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,832
I should get going.

677
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,397
Got the big man from Philly
coming in tonight.

678
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,748
You want me to stay,
I'll stay.

679
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,753
I mean, Jimmie knows
everything that we know.

680
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,146
No.

681
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:55,551
For the six months
we put in on this,

682
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,325
you gotta be there.

683
00:35:06,804 --> 00:35:08,669
I'll swing by tomorrow.

684
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,200
Hey, Eddie.

685
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:12,975
Yeah?

686
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,012
I'm sorry.

687
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,308
You know,
that I can't go with you.

688
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,760
It was all our fault.

689
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,699
We were screwing
with Foreman,

690
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:42,034
trying to make him think
he made less than we did.

691
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,267
Obviously, things got
out of control.

692
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,539
Someone does something
stupid and insensitive,

693
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,308
I always figure
it was House.

694
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,481
Good to know
it's catching.

695
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,744
Look, there is
no other job.

696
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,115
He was just trying
to get a raise.

697
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,746
Even if you gave him a little
more money, I know he'd stay.

698
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,790
I'm not giving
Foreman a raise

699
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,451
because the three of you
decided to amuse yourselves.

700
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,392
We know. And that's why we want you

701
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,692
to take it out
of our pay checks.

702
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,365
You two okay with this?

703
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,626
Is there
any other option?

704
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,295
We're okay with it.

705
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,602
Foreman is
a good team leader.

706
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:18,765
He deserves it.

707
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,508
Okay, then.

708
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,877
That is what I will do.

709
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:26,113
And just so you know,

710
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,815
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

711
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:32,287
I haven't seen Foreman
in three days.

712
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:47,502
The phrase "Who's your
daddy?" Comes to mind.

713
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,710
You wanna grab
some coffee?

714
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,515
Kind of a bad time.

715
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,989
Sorry.
You told me to drop by,

716
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,752
so this is when
I could make it.

717
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,793
Right. Come in.

718
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:21,630
This whole thing with
Wilson, it's all my fault.

719
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,504
We're not closeted
because we're not gay.

720
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,272
For real.

721
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,441
Wilson thought
you were cute,

722
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,447
I was just
yanking his chain.

723
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,577
Maybe that's not
the best phrasing.

724
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,418
So you were only spending
time with me to screw with him?

725
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,389
God, no. I was
spending time with you

726
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,016
because I want
to touch your boobs.

727
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:45,358
<i>Enough to listen to Evita,
twice, and I really hate Evita.</i>

728
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,863
That's how much
I like your boobs.

729
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,865
Wait. Wait, wait.

730
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,571
Wilson, he's a really good
guy and he really likes you.

731
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,016
Well, it's really...

732
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,076
It's sweet of you to stick
up for your friend like that.

733
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,654
And you're still trying
to sleep with me.

734
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:19,787
Maybe I will call him,
it would serve you right.

735
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,695
Wilson's a jerk, too.

736
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,825
At least he tried to
do the right thing.

737
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:25,630
He's been
divorced three times,

738
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,364
he slept with
a dying patient.

739
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:30,407
Sure, he looks like
a Boy Scout, but that...

740
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,257
The aneurysms
look mycotic,

741
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,855
but they're not,
they're inflammatory.

742
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,967
Because it's not
a fungal infection.

743
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,162
The hypertension
was a real symptom.

744
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:02,467
You've been unwittingly
treating it with beta-blockers.

745
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,067
You stopped taking them and
your blood pressure went up.

746
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,007
It's Hughes-Stovin.

747
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,980
Okay, so how
do we treat this?

748
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:21,281
We don't.

749
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,858
Hughes-Stovin is
an autoimmune disease.

750
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:27,125
Once it's this advanced,
there's not much we can do.

751
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,324
The aneurysms
keep multiplying.

752
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,665
Eventually,
one of them will rupture.

753
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:36,996
Are you sure?

754
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,242
If you die in the next
day or so, I will be.

755
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,072
Even if you had told us
everything we wanted to know,

756
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,380
it wouldn't have
made a difference.

757
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,113
You did the right thing.

758
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:00,686
I think I should
call my wife now.

759
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,643
I'm sorry
about your patient.

760
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,914
He died a hero
in his own mind.

761
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,648
I guess it's
better than nothing.

762
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:07,052
Ran into Nora
in the elevator.

763
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,115
She no longer
thinks we're gay,

764
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,753
now she thinks we're
mendacious dirtbags.

765
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,056
Mendacious dirtbag comes
much more naturally to me.

766
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,266
At least we can
get rid of that.

767
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:21,298
I kind of like it.

768
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,363
Unlike this sofa.

769
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,465
It's 500 bucks.

770
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,603
And it reclines.

771
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:37,411
<i>One singular sensation
Every little step she takes</i>

772
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,388
I will punch you
in the face.

773
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,788
I'll stop if you
get rid of the sofa.

774
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,652
No chance.

775
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:50,291
<i>One thrilling combination
Every move that she makes</i>

776
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:57,940
<i>One smile and
suddenly nobody else will do</i>
