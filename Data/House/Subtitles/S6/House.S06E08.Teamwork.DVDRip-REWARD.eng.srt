1
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,207
This bagel's as hard
as a hockey puck.

2
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,299
Then don't eat it.

3
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:13,141
Used to be a full breakfast
service. They're trying to starve us.

4
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,976
You're worried
about the food?

5
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:17,312
No, I'm worried about
what the food represents.

6
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,319
I've got seven scenes to shoot today
on half of what we used to spend.

7
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,548
We're going through a
recession. It is what it is.

8
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:24,419
Yeah, but nobody's
gonna bail us out.

9
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,756
Free content everywhere,
DVD sales in the toilet,

10
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:31,092
now the back-office bean counters
are vetoing half my ideas.

11
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,361
So we can kind of make it
about the performances.

12
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:35,823
You okay?

13
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:37,028
Bit of a headache.

14
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:38,263
If you need
an ibuprofen...

15
00:00:38,338 --> 00:00:39,930
I need you to put your
game face on, right?

16
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,236
Screw the bagels, screw the
sets, screw the wardrobe.

17
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:44,299
You have any idea
how lucky we are?

18
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,004
We get to do
something we like,

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,537
we get to touch people's
lives, and we get paid for it.

20
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,106
Let's make a movie.

21
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,617
Hey, baby.

22
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,591
All right.
Roll camera.

23
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,689
And

24
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,491
action.

25
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:13,695
What's wrong?

26
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,806
My eyes. They feel
like they're exploding.

27
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,446
All right. Turn off
the damn light.

28
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,539
Get an ambulance. Now!

29
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,421
We're gonna be
late for work.

30
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,616
Then we'll be late.

31
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,062
You took a patient's life.
You lied about it for weeks,

32
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,693
you broke who knows how many
laws and oaths to cover it up,

33
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,336
but I can live with it.

34
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,406
We can get
through it together.

35
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,674
You have no idea what
I've been living with,

36
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,273
and what it means
to hear you say that.

37
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,548
But we need to get away
from Princeton-Plainsboro.

38
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,819
You can barely walk by the
rooms where Dibala was treated.

39
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,352
Why should we live with
that hanging over our heads?

40
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,799
If there was ever
a time to turn the page...

41
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,363
Three-month-old with fever,

42
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,171
incessant drooling,
and chronic muscle weakness.

43
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:04,945
Or porn actor Hank Hardwick, born
Henry Lefkowitz, totally clean workup,

44
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,316
collapsed on the job
with extreme photophobia.

45
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,480
Or an infant as limp
as a rag doll.

46
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,649
Yeah. Let's wait till
Chase and Cameron get here.

47
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,885
I have the feeling they'll have
the good sense to side with me.

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,258
Doesn't matter who they side
with, I'm still in charge.

49
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,559
We're taking the
limp three-month-old.

50
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,657
Oh, good, you paged
the limpness specialist.

51
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,466
This envelope is oddly
medical-licensed shaped.

52
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,806
Congratulations.

53
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:41,443
House is back in charge.
We get to treat a porn star.

54
00:03:41,854 --> 00:03:42,843
Congratulations.

55
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,913
Perfect timing for us.

56
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:49,121
We're leaving the team and the
hospital, effective immediately.

57
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,064
It's kind of sudden.

58
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,224
Unless you've been circulating
your résumés for a while.

59
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,235
We're just starting to think about
new jobs, where we want to live.

60
00:03:57,303 --> 00:03:59,567
Moving, too.
Interesting.

61
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,799
Are you sure about this?

62
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:03,867
Yes.

63
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,271
We'll miss you.

64
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,372
We'll miss all of you, too.

65
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,145
We'll start clearing
out our things.

66
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,515
Run an STD panel
and a tox screen,

67
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,991
send a C-reactive protein
to look for inflammation

68
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,960
and an ANA to screen
for autoimmune.

69
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:27,557
The rest of you take a history and do
an LP to rule out viral encephalitis.

70
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,659
Oh, it's just you.

71
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,206
Here's hoping you're
good at multitasking.

72
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,177
I get tested
for STDs regularly,

73
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,336
so does everyone
I work with.

74
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:42,472
Since I'm guessing you don't
take their word for it...

75
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:47,508
All right. I'm gonna need you to lie on
your side and put your knees to your chest.

76
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,987
Any history of alcohol
or substance abuse?

77
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:54,390
My wife used to smoke a little
pot, but I never touch the stuff.

78
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,825
You're married?

79
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,090
Happily.
Two years now.

80
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,325
She happy you do porn?

81
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,800
Very.
Since she does it, too.

82
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,035
You ever get jealous
when your wife's working?

83
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,471
It's a job.

84
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,003
Once you start letting your
work life rule your home life,

85
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:14,843
especially if you're in the same line of
work, your relationship's gonna be short.

86
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,348
You're gonna feel
a little pressure.

87
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,884
Any history of sexual abuse?

88
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:20,680
I defy the cliché.

89
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:22,846
Have you ever suffered
depression or psychosis?

90
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,517
Let me save you some time. There's
not a blotch on my medical record.

91
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,026
Look, I know most
of the people in my field

92
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,359
are drug addicts
with daddy issues.

93
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,424
But I'm a nice Jewish boy from the
'burbs. I wasn't driven to this.

94
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,937
I chose it. I believe in
it. I actually think it's...

95
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,266
My arms are killing me.

96
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,537
Looks like tetany. Your
muscles are contracting.

97
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,838
Need some meperidine in here.

98
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,345
Oh, God.

99
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:52,140
Jew with megalophallus,
photophobia, and muscle spasm.

100
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,515
You tell me which
is the most unusual.

101
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:59,891
Four candidates,
three slots on the team.

102
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,257
Need to know if you've still
got your diagnostic chops.

103
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,592
I leave this office
by 6:00 every day.

104
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,098
I have my weekends again.
I recognize my wife again.

105
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,727
Yeah, I agree, does sound pretty dull.
No wonder you want to work for me.

106
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:14,466
Tox screen was clean, we
ruled out viral encephalitis.

107
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:22,880
The only obstacle to you
coming back is your wife,

108
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,217
which has never been that
much of an obstacle to you.

109
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:33,121
Maybe you're right.

110
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:38,395
The only link between eye
and muscle is the brain.

111
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,329
Tumor, seizure...

112
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,837
Taub seems to think the
link has to be the brain,

113
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,134
but eye and muscle
are governed

114
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:53,509
by different parts of the patient's
second-favorite organ, which means it's...

115
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:56,611
Thailand was wonderful,
thanks for asking.

116
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,446
Of course, yes,
it has to be multi-focal.

117
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,147
I have an interview with a
community health clinic in two hours.

118
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,247
Backup plan's fine, but
Taub's swinging for the fences.

119
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:06,814
I suggest you don't
divide your attention.

120
00:07:06,893 --> 00:07:09,862
Good point. I won't
divide my attention then.

121
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:12,262
Taub thinks
it's a brain issue,

122
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,923
Thirteen thinks
it's multi-focal.

123
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,728
And neither of them
wants to work here.

124
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,030
Don't take
their word for it.

125
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,537
Taub's problem is his wife,
Thirteen's problem is you,

126
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,574
Chase and Cameron's problem
is the dead African dictator.

127
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:25,270
None of them has a
problem with the work.

128
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:29,114
Cerebral vasculitis would explain
both the eye and arm findings.

129
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,310
Steroids to treat, brain
angiogram to confirm,

130
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:36,321
EMG and a nerve biopsy while
you're at it. I'll be at lunch.

131
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,917
I'd hire all four, but a
five-person team seems unwieldy.

132
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:43,919
Who would you turn down?

133
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,398
I'll have whatever
he's buying.

134
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,367
Two cheeseburgers
and two large fries.

135
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:52,563
There are a thousand people in the
world who want to be on your staff,

136
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,572
but you're going after
the four who don't.

137
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,077
They don't because their lives are
irrelevantly and annoyingly complicated,

138
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,205
which makes them confused, which
makes them make poor decisions.

139
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:03,714
And your life is simple?

140
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,684
You went all the way up to the
medical conference to cozy up to Cuddy.

141
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:10,415
Instead, she's dating one of two people
in the world you think of as a friend.

142
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,287
There's no way
that's not devastating.

143
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:14,383
So I had
an attraction of sorts.

144
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,859
Yeah, the sort in which

145
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,091
your imaginary tryst landed
you in a mental hospital.

146
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:22,396
And I got help,
and she got Lucas,

147
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,096
who bought me a ginger
ale. It's all fine.

148
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,033
Which won't be true
of my department

149
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,371
unless I can figure out
which doctor I'm not hiring.

150
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,509
I suppose throwing yourself into your
work isn't the worst thing you could do.

151
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,408
What is the worst
thing I could do?

152
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,784
House thinks
it's cerebral vasculitis.

153
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,322
If you could just do the brain angio
while I finish up the blood work...

154
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,516
We're out the door.

155
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,582
He's got me running every
test and treatment by myself.

156
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,457
Which is why you should
be out the door, too.

157
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,589
This is completely
unreasonable, even for House.

158
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,125
You owe me this.

159
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,940
Thank you.

160
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,634
You really believe
this is cerebral vasculitis?

161
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,769
Could be.

162
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,414
House wants to thread a
catheter through his brain,

163
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,882
which could cause
a vasospasm,

164
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:14,215
give steroids, which could spread
infection all over the place,

165
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,413
because it could be.

166
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,080
Sounds like House.

167
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,989
It could also be a severe
vitamin D deficiency.

168
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,823
He has a restrictive diet,
works long hours indoors,

169
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,296
became hypocalcemic,
got tetany and photophobia.

170
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,798
You're saying I shouldn't do the angio?

171
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,358
House ordered it, Foreman wants
it, of course we should do it.

172
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm just saying
we're right to leave.

173
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,630
You sure?

174
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,004
Because right now I'd basically
do anything you asked me.

175
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:39,704
I'm not interested in
guilting you. We're moving on.

176
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,107
Right after I take the patient
to the phototherapy suite,

177
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:47,618
blast him with ultraviolet
light and IV vitamins

178
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:50,315
for his severe
vitamin D deficiency.

179
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,953
Do you guys actually
work together?

180
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,555
We did at first. But now we like
to keep our films pretty separate.

181
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,328
So, do you
watch her work?

182
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,528
We're both busy
with our own stuff.

183
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,066
Think what you want, but
we're proud of what we do.

184
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,335
Divorcing sex from
all emotional content?

185
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,003
Emotion is emotional,
sex is mechanical.

186
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,377
There doesn't really
need to be any overlap.

187
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,541
Certainly not
in your world.

188
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,748
We've helped
a lot of couples

189
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,686
by taking sex out of
some deep, dark dungeon.

190
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:26,316
Do what you want without
some big moral comeuppance.

191
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:29,987
You think you can escape the
consequences, but you can't.

192
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,589
You don't get to make
your own rules and morals.

193
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:36,396
Well, you're here to treat
him, not lecture us about our...

194
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,302
Hank, are you all right?
Are you okay?

195
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:41,965
Just a nosebleed.

196
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,573
Inside his leg?

197
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:50,108
Petechial hemorrhages.

198
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,616
We were wrong,
so was Foreman.

199
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,881
Patient's blood won't clot.
We're back to square one.

200
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,190
And you're back in my office.
So much for playing hard to get.

201
00:11:03,262 --> 00:11:05,696
We're just here
to help Foreman.

202
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,289
Is that...

203
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:08,924
He's not without talent.

204
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:13,233
UV rays made the patient's capillaries
more fragile, hastening the onset of DIC.

205
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,738
Sounds like sepsis...
But isn't.

206
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,741
No sign of shock,
no drop in blood pressure.

207
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:17,901
Can we turn that off?

208
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:20,241
Right, because Cameron
thinks pornography is evil.

209
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,974
I don't care what he does.
I don't care what you watch.

210
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,574
I just think it's annoying that he
pretends it's some beautiful life

211
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,846
we should all
be aspiring to.

212
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,615
Left shift points
to bacteremia.

213
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,819
No fever, plus it wouldn't explain
the spasmodic muscle contractions.

214
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:36,623
The ball-and-chain
smacked you down.

215
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:40,792
But widespread petechial rash,
nervous system involvement...

216
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,167
It's some kind of blood
infection. Meningococcemia.

217
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,169
Start the patient
on heparin for the DIC,

218
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,175
broad-spectrum antibiotics
for the meningococcemia.

219
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:53,743
Dr. Cameron.

220
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:59,614
Chase is relaxed, at ease,
in lock-step with you again.

221
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,018
I guess he finally told you
that he iced Idi Amin Jr.

222
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,455
Does that mean he can break the
other nine commandments, too?

223
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,253
Taking the Lord's
name in vain, sure,

224
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:09,954
but coveting thy
neighbor's wife?

225
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,428
Is she hot?

226
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,487
I've forgiven him.

227
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,193
Not for murder.
Not you.

228
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,292
Doesn't matter
how evil Dibala was.

229
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:21,271
By every conscience- hugging,
Mother-Teresa- loving bone in your body,

230
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,365
you should be leaving him,
not leaving with him.

231
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,273
I thought your position
was our leaving is a ruse.

232
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,504
We're not talking
about my position,

233
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,171
we're talking about yours,
which doesn't add up.

234
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,943
Here's what doesn't add up. If you
were serious about staffing your team,

235
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,644
you would know exactly which
three fellows you wanted.

236
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,711
You plowed ahead with this case even
though you hadn't hired new fellows

237
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,349
because you knew Foreman
would ask Chase and me to help,

238
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,552
giving you more time
to blow up our marriage.

239
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,356
I don't want that.

240
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,054
But we'd be foolish
not to plan ahead.

241
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:50,228
A, my firing Chase was the only
reason you left two years ago.

242
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:55,035
B, when the full horror of his homicide
hits you, your marriage will blow up.

243
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:59,305
And Z, the only obstacle of
you working here will be gone.

244
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,313
Or maybe I skipped
a couple of letters.

245
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,585
Meningococcemia's spread
person-to-person.

246
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:14,057
Something you ought to think about
next time you show up for work.

247
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,118
It's okay,
your wife's not here.

248
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,188
I'm just telling you what...

249
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:22,063
You have to lecture me
when she's around, I get it.

250
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,901
But I can tell from all the questions you
ask that you're more like me than you admit.

251
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:31,500
I'm a guy, I look around every
once in a while, but I love my wife.

252
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:33,943
I love the fact that she's the
only one that I'm intimate with.

253
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:39,041
And no part of you wants to just toss
this rulebook everyone's forced on you?

254
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,951
No part of you wants a
life of actual commitment?

255
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:44,512
Is my relationship
perfect? No.

256
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:49,420
Am I ever horny when my wife has
just had sex for nine hours? Yes.

257
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:54,129
But we are committed to each
other in every way that matters.

258
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,792
In other words,
you're committed,

259
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,359
except when you're
not committed.

260
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:00,735
Doesn't work so well
if you have a conscience.

261
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,900
Conscience? You mean
that thing that kicks in

262
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:08,106
when there's no logical reason to
behave the way people want you to?

263
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,375
What?
You have a fever.

264
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,515
Means the antibiotics
aren't working.

265
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,484
Mr. Takayama?

266
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:21,651
Yes.

267
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,161
I'm really happy with what
the last guy did with my eyes,

268
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:29,429
but why would broad-spectrum antibiotics
fail to work on meningococcemia?

269
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:32,766
If you'll excuse me,
I've got a real patient. Mr...

270
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,163
Hitler? Really?

271
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,678
I had to do something to amuse myself while
your receptionist fought with her boyfriend.

272
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,007
Who's next?

273
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,777
A guy who needs two decades' worth of
corn chips hoovered out of his neck,

274
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,342
or a guy who can't stand daylight
and whose blood won't clot.

275
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,717
You do the triage.

276
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:50,982
Who's the jerk?

277
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,082
Someone with zero chance
of hiring me back.

278
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,253
I told you. I'm content
at home and at work.

279
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,263
But you're not
content with content.

280
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:01,356
It's why you got sucked
into those stock scams,

281
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,697
why you cheated
on the wife you love.

282
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,259
At bridge.

283
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:08,799
My wife and I play
a lot of bridge.

284
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,398
Why you worked on the case
the last time I was here.

285
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,500
I gave you a theory,

286
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,943
just like I'd help a guy who
needs a Heimlich in a restaurant,

287
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:15,742
and then I shut
the door behind you.

288
00:15:15,814 --> 00:15:18,442
Yeah. But you'd knock over three
other doctors to give it to him.

289
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:20,280
Metaphorically speaking,
you're a Heimlich addict.

290
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,649
And you're an
addiction addict.

291
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,517
Right now, your drug of
choice is your old team,

292
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,750
and like any addict, you're
trying to solve some other problem,

293
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,951
and it's not gonna work. If
you'll excuse me, I have a...

294
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,689
You have a tight schedule
of nose jobs and tummy tucks.

295
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,698
Yes, I do nose jobs, just like the
guy who came here after a car crash,

296
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,360
couldn't even breathe
through his...

297
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,775
Antibiotics wouldn't work if his
sinuses were infected and clogged,

298
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:48,939
if there was a pocket of bacteria
his blood vessels couldn't reach.

299
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,609
You surgically drain his
sinuses, the drugs will work.

300
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,279
Nice.

301
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,355
Tell me that
didn't feel good.

302
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,852
See you tomorrow.

303
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:02,955
Not coming back.

304
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,395
Looks like quite a trip.

305
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:17,970
It was.

306
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,868
House send you
to talk to me?

307
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,004
No.

308
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,710
Then there's nothing to talk
about. I don't want to work for him.

309
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:31,155
You're a great doctor. House
is right to want you in the mix.

310
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,252
You saying this because you
still have feelings for me

311
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,452
and you want me
to come back?

312
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:38,018
I'm saying that
shouldn't be an issue.

313
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,657
Do you have feelings
for me or not?

314
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,466
I don't want our work life to have
anything to do with our personal life.

315
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,367
You couldn't keep
them separate.

316
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:49,498
And that's why our
personal life doesn't exist.

317
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,134
None of that has to...

318
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,270
I can't work with you.

319
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,311
Actually, you can.

320
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:02,285
I was the one who had the
problem. I don't any more.

321
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,927
<i>I owe you an apology.</i>

322
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,930
<i>I was... I was...</i>

323
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,930
What were you
wrong about?

324
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:26,774
<i>You spent weeks elaborately concealing
the fact that you'd crashed daddy's car.</i>

325
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:31,509
<i>Then you just confessed. Seemed
idiotic, certain to end in disaster.</i>

326
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,781
<i>Instead, you're riding off
into the sunset together.</i>

327
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,218
<i>Any theories on why?</i>

328
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:39,917
I assume you've already dismissed
the "she loves me" theory?

329
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,550
<i>It's possible.</i>

330
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,527
It would require the
presupposition that everything

331
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,085
she's done for
the last six years

332
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,995
has been completely
inconsistent with her character,

333
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,761
but, yeah,
it's possible.

334
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,598
As we've already established, it's
also possible that you're wrong.

335
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,002
<i>Or there's another
explanation.</i>

336
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,306
<i>Since you don't have one, I'm
gonna keep looking for you.</i>

337
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,782
Let him drain, then pack it with
anesthetics and sterile gauze.

338
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,476
Do you have any idea
what's going on with House?

339
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,388
He's trying to get
his old fellows back.

340
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,982
It's called stalking.

341
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,960
I am way too busy to
play officer of the court.

342
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,521
That's a shame, since you're
the one who triggered this.

343
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:22,523
What do you see
in Lucas anyway?

344
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,660
I don't see that
it's any of your business.

345
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,363
Did you think House
wouldn't find out?

346
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,666
You could've
at least told me,

347
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:30,139
so I wouldn't have coached him on
how to prove his worthiness to you.

348
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,805
I know you're upset with me because I
didn't choose to date your best friend,

349
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,280
but I'm living my life.

350
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,441
For the first time.

351
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:43,318
I'm not gonna change that because
of how it might affect him, or you.

352
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,125
I feel like crap.

353
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:58,433
Yeah, look, our relationship is gonna
be about House or it's gonna be about us.

354
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,969
I vote for it
being about us.

355
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,371
House is gonna make
it about him for us.

356
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,536
This is very insulting. You're
apparently shocked by this,

357
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:10,173
which means that you thought that
there was some way that we could date,

358
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,514
get married, have two kids,
a dog, retire to Florida,

359
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,416
all without House
finding out.

360
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:19,082
Or you thought that we
wouldn't date all that long.

361
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,254
The first means
you're delusional,

362
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,487
the second means
I'm delusional.

363
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,894
Technically, it could also mean
you thought House had matured,

364
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:27,625
but then we're
back to your being...

365
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:29,166
Shut up.

366
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,868
You're right.
I'm sorry.

367
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,405
I'm also flattered.

368
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:37,567
Yeah, 'cause you acted all
cool and everything with Wilson,

369
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,942
but you feel comfortable enough
with me that you can freak out.

370
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,310
That's cool.

371
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,181
His sinuses are clear. The
antibiotics should work this time.

372
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,784
Why did you forgive me?

373
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:01,356
I mean, I'm glad, I'm
grateful, but I'm confused.

374
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,628
You've been harder on the
patient than you've been on me.

375
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:09,504
The difference between you and the
patient is that you feel shame, guilt.

376
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:13,836
That's how I know we're
gonna get through this.

377
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,604
My stomach.

378
00:20:19,518 --> 00:20:21,110
It really hurts.

379
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:25,384
His liver's failing.

380
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:32,854
His liver's failing and his abdomen
keeps filling with fluid, so...

381
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,262
It's not meningococcemia.

382
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,393
No matter how much you
finish each other's sentences,

383
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,563
don't count on being
a diagnostic package deal.

384
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,072
Patient's liver's
not working.

385
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,109
We don't have time
for your little team-stakes.

386
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,044
Sometimes you're just
wrong.

387
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,281
Something genetic, something in
his family history we overlooked?

388
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,977
History and genetics
are spotless.

389
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:55,576
Plus, every time he had a bad
cough as a kid, he went to a doctor.

390
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,519
Klatskin tumor,
obstructing his bile ducts?

391
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,557
No jaundice, wouldn't
have ocular effects.

392
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,890
But if it's inflammation inside the
bile channels, sclerosing cholangitis.

393
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,724
Could've stopped him from
producing clotting proteins,

394
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,889
damaged his blood cells,
causing small strokes.

395
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:10,901
Enough, enough! Stop
pummeling Thirteen and Taub.

396
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:16,639
It fits. Prep the patient for an ERCP,

397
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,040
see if there's any hope of
opening his blocked bile channels.

398
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,239
And tell them to start
looking for a liver donor.

399
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,547
Dr. Chase.

400
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,416
Your turn.

401
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:30,054
So what did she say?

402
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:34,056
She forgave me
because I feel guilty.

403
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,017
That works, too.

404
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:39,154
And now you expect me to ask
you what the "too" refers to?

405
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:43,565
Only if you're interested. Only if
you have doubts about her answer.

406
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,667
She thinks that you don't have
anything to feel guilty about

407
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,538
because you didn't kill anybody, I did.

408
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,642
She blames me for
Dibala's murder, not you.

409
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,875
You were barely involved in
that case, she knows that.

410
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:02,079
But I created the big, bad, evil
climate that allowed it to happen.

411
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,054
You're wrong.

412
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,555
Powerful
counter-argument.

413
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:09,390
Why are you doing this? Why are
you trying to screw things up?

414
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,429
You got the tense wrong.

415
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,220
Things are already
screwed up.

416
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,533
Which is why you don't just
want to work for me, you need to.

417
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,126
Cameron thinks you're
my personal sock puppet.

418
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:22,970
If you don't stay, it's gonna
be hard to prove you're not.

419
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,565
I have to go.

420
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,323
Last week, my cane
could only do 10 minutes.

421
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,861
What are you
doing here?

422
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:48,627
Waiting for you to take a nap
so I can surge into the lead.

423
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:56,835
What's the best way to restore the liver
in someone with sclerosing cholangitis?

424
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:58,034
Not getting
drawn into this.

425
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,270
You already are.

426
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:00,777
Because you crashed
my workout?

427
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,679
You're doing core training,
which improves balance,

428
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:07,583
which staves off the most
debilitating symptoms of Huntington's.

429
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:09,984
You've ended your
self-destructive streak.

430
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,285
You want to do
something significant,

431
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:16,259
something that'll last longer
than the few years you have left.

432
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,853
My team is your
first, best choice.

433
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:23,867
And my first choice is the community
health clinic I interviewed with yesterday.

434
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,402
Absolutely,
you should do that.

435
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,201
Three hours a week, every doctor
should, because every doctor can.

436
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,367
But you don't want
to be every doctor.

437
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,640
Plus, on my team, you
get to screw with Foreman.

438
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,678
Every way but literally.

439
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,875
Why are you
doing it this way?

440
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:41,410
You're pretending to assume
we're all coming back,

441
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:43,886
without actually
asking us. Why?

442
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:47,789
See, this is why you'd be
miserable wiping noses in a clinic.

443
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:52,797
You can't ask because you
can't face the rejection.

444
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,092
Why not?
What's going on?

445
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:55,656
Are you asking me
to ask you?

446
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:59,295
I'm saying you shouldn't,
for your sake as well as mine.

447
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:05,465
We don't know how much the sclerosing
cholangitis has damaged your liver.

448
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,138
It might be in a year, might be in 10,

449
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,082
but the odds are you're
gonna need a new one.

450
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:18,181
And you should know, while no transplant
committee will say this openly,

451
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:22,386
they'll never grant an organ to
someone working in your profession.

452
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:26,223
You're saying
I have to change jobs?

453
00:24:26,565 --> 00:24:29,591
You're medically advising
me to change jobs?

454
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,794
Hank, if you're too sick...

455
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,803
She wants me to have some
kind of religious conversion.

456
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,395
She's practically
salivating over it.

457
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,270
I'm just being
candid about...

458
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:40,209
So you don't think I'm scum, just
some committee thinks I'm scum?

459
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:42,041
That your lifestyle
has risks.

460
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:45,981
You work around more sick people,
and germs, and blood than I do.

461
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,680
I'm not gonna live my life
afraid like my parents did.

462
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:53,918
Barely letting me play outside and
God forbid that I get a scratch.

463
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,987
I'll talk to him. He'll calm down
and realize that this is the only way.

464
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,394
No. No, I won't.

465
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,830
Why does everyone want to
dictate the way I live my life?

466
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,994
Because the way we're
living it is gonna kill you.

467
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:12,138
Passing
the pancreatic duct.

468
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,678
Don't listen to House.

469
00:25:14,746 --> 00:25:16,179
You have no idea
what he said.

470
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,079
I know that House
is manipulative.

471
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,140
I know that you're in a
vulnerable state right now.

472
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:24,245
And I know that Cameron wants
your marriage to work, so do you.

473
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:25,983
So don't listen
to House.

474
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,491
House doesn't
make my decisions.

475
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,828
I'm in the common bile duct.

476
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,092
What's that mass?
Gallstone?

477
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,926
Can we magnify times five?

478
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,038
That's not a gallstone.

479
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,907
His liver's completely
filled with worms.

480
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,711
You have strongyloides,
also known as threadworms.

481
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,547
They disseminated all over your
body, causing all your symptoms.

482
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,813
How'd I get a parasite?

483
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,687
Most likely through sexual
activity, but we can't be sure.

484
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,456
And what's the treatment?

485
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,960
Two mebendazole pills.

486
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:07,264
That's it?

487
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,893
You'll be fine. Your liver,
too. Go back to your lives.

488
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,010
You know this is
the doctors' lounge.

489
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,170
I know.

490
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,911
It seemed like the place
to read doctors' notes.

491
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,383
You are good at it,
by the way.

492
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,017
Why are you
reading my charts?

493
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,019
Because I'm worried
about my girlfriend.

494
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,785
Your girlfriend is
a male porn star?

495
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:39,352
No, I'm dating Lisa Cuddy.

496
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,661
Seriously?
Cool, huh?

497
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,133
And if House doesn't have his
team, that'll make her miserable,

498
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,794
which will make
me miserable.

499
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:50,307
Which brings us to the fact that you
have elevated noting to an art form.

500
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,635
I see the connection.

501
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,007
Most doctors
write "9:00 a. m. "

502
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,705
If they scrub in at 9:00
or anything near it.

503
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:59,341
You write "9:03" and you make little
notations when procedures are delayed.

504
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,280
You're easily impressed.

505
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,981
Well, yeah. I was.

506
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:08,048
Until I saw that you had virtually
stopped writing them about four weeks ago.

507
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,559
Been busy.
Got a backlog.

508
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:15,191
Yeah, people with your level of
precision don't really just get backlogs.

509
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,204
No one knows why
you're leaving PPTH.

510
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:21,568
Because it's personal.

511
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,365
If something happened...

512
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,808
I mean, if you're leaving to get away
from something that you did, or she did,

513
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:28,573
or both of you did...

514
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,810
I mean, emotionally, maybe you want
to run away, but in my experience,

515
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,876
if you're staring at a pit
bull in some guy's back yard,

516
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:39,055
you're better off staying
right where you are.

517
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,389
Face the problem, that way
it can't bite you in the ass.

518
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,229
Thanks for
the folksy wisdom.

519
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:53,661
Hey, you got any dirt
on any of the other three?

520
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,007
It'd really help me out.

521
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,443
I thought you said those
two pills was all he needed.

522
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,504
Lungs are
filling with fluid.

523
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,846
Suction him and
get him on oxygen.

524
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,618
Patient's lungs are severely
compromised, liver's still failing.

525
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,719
Worms could easily
have been a coincidence.

526
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,525
Almost be surprising
if he didn't have them.

527
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:23,260
Which means it could be a hematological
problem plus cardiomyopathy.

528
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,792
No. Neck veins are flat,
precordial exam was normal.

529
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,566
What if it's lymphoma?

530
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,473
Peritoneal carcinomatosis
explains the liver failure,

531
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,842
paraneoplastic syndrome
explains everything else.

532
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,783
Lymphoma it is.
Prep him for chemo.

533
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:43,984
Fax Taub and Thirteen the
latest update on the case.

534
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:48,557
Seriously?

535
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,153
They have as much right to
know as anyone on the team.

536
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,561
You either like the
diagnosis or you don't.

537
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:57,431
If you don't, we need to keep talking.
If you do, you need to shut up.

538
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,198
What we don't need
is this stupid game.

539
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,104
You're mad at House,
but you're not mad at me.

540
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:12,581
Do you want me
to be mad at you?

541
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,584
You blame House,
not me.

542
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:16,711
I'm mad at House
because he's an ass.

543
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,848
And I am mad at you, but
I don't want to leave you.

544
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:23,690
What I did may be the worst thing
I ever did, it may be the best.

545
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,754
I'm either a murderer or a guy
who stopped a mass murderer.

546
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,856
But I did it. Me.

547
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:32,830
And even if it destroys me,
I'd do it again today.

548
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,269
You don't mean that.
This isn't you...

549
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:39,174
I'm not running away from what I did
because you want to pretend I never did it.

550
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:43,605
If that's how you feel,

551
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,411
okay.

552
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,018
My strategy is not
completely working.

553
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,463
All four of them
want to work for me,

554
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,728
but all four of them have reasons
why they don't want to work for me.

555
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:07,135
How do I get them to take one from
column A and none from column B?

556
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,338
Right.

557
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,676
Right, by not saying anything, you're
saying that the answer's inside me?

558
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,875
The answer has nothing
to do with the question.

559
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,781
Then it's not
technically the answer.

560
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,752
Why do you need
three of these doctors?

561
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:28,191
Because I know they're good. Other doctors
fall into the might-be-good category.

562
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,920
It has nothing to do
with them being good,

563
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,689
you think they're
idiots half the time.

564
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,754
But they're comfortable.
You feel abandoned by Cuddy,

565
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:37,268
so you're reaching out to
people you know for comfort.

566
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,930
Oh, my God, you're right.
I don't need doctors at all.

567
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:43,730
I just need a good friend.

568
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,167
Cuddy's right.

569
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:49,179
Maybe, just maybe, if I don't
play along, you'll realize

570
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,774
you can't solve a deeper
problem with a surface solution.

571
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:57,079
Would've been more profound
if you hadn't said anything.

572
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:00,791
You okay?

573
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,224
Getting through it.

574
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,784
Be a lot easier once you
two are away from here.

575
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,023
Yeah.

576
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,396
He's peeing blood.

577
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,727
BP's rising.

578
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:13,896
Heart rate is up to 250.

579
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,065
He's going into
cardiac arrest.

580
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,137
Charging. Clear.

581
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:21,636
He's bleeding out.

582
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,237
His body's
completely giving out.

583
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,941
Charging. Clear.

584
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:28,110
We've got him stabilized,

585
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,154
but no red cells,
no white cells,

586
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,711
practically no
platelets either.

587
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,587
Mebendazole can cause adverse
effects, but nothing like this.

588
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:37,253
He's been off it
since yesterday anyway.

589
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,628
Long passes, wild guesses, anything.

590
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,760
Hypopituitarism? Could cause
multi-organ failure if...

591
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,305
If his thyroid hormone
wasn't completely normal.

592
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,806
Renal cell carcinoma.

593
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,307
Renal ultrasound was clean.

594
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:53,742
I'd say aleukemic leukemia,

595
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:55,438
marrow's not making
enough normal cells, but...

596
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:59,244
Ablate the patient's bone
marrow, find him a donor match.

597
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,279
You want to nuke
the patient's marrow?

598
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,617
He had no evidence of being
anemic or immune-compromised

599
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,623
when he was admitted...
Perfect white count as well.

600
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,988
Ablation
could kill him,

601
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,085
or leave him defenseless
against an infection that could.

602
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,653
Then come up with
something better.

603
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:21,104
He may as well die
while we're treating him.

604
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,467
Okay with you if I bring the
other candidates into the loop now?

605
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,479
The risks,
they're really minimal.

606
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,610
We'll do a series
of painless injections...

607
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,286
Excuse me.

608
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,050
The whole thing can be
done as an outpatient.

609
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,808
You're leaving
at 11:00 a. M?

610
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,014
Trust me, the case
is almost over.

611
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,579
Foreman told me you're
ablating the patient's marrow

612
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,645
on a non-theory that
Foreman himself withdrew.

613
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,088
You're gonna kill
the patient.

614
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,788
Is this about
me and Lucas?

615
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:22,865
I want alternatives
for the patient.

616
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:24,128
So do I.

617
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,972
I want to be on the team.

618
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,320
You think that's gonna
save your marriage?

619
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,350
I don't know.

620
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,030
Four candidates,
three spots.

621
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,301
I got a tough decision
ahead of me.

622
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:29,230
<i>Hi. Remy, this is Dr. Turner
from the Pennsauken Free Clinic.</i>

623
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,895
<i>We all loved meeting you,
and the job's yours.</i>

624
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:35,700
<i>Call me back,
let's pick a start date.</i>

625
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,355
I want it to look natural. I
mean, much younger, but natural.

626
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,451
Can you get rid of the
crow's feet altogether?

627
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:59,621
Or is it better to
leave a trace of them?

628
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,359
I don't look old enough
to have them anyway, do I?

629
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,491
Absolutely.

630
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:04,967
I do look old enough?

631
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:06,025
No.

632
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,264
I'm sorry.
Hang on a second.

633
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,147
Why are you here?

634
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:24,416
Because I think we're wrong, which
means something's gonna go wrong.

635
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,022
Or right.

636
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,218
Takayama here.

637
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,454
It's me and Thirteen,
stop the ablation.

638
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,657
Because...

639
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:36,825
<i>Those threadworms.</i>

640
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,768
Why would his body have gone to
hell just hours after they were gone?

641
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,896
The worms weren't hurting him,
they were helping him.

642
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,237
He has extra-intestinal Crohn's.

643
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,572
<i>He got it from being
raised in too clean,</i>

644
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,407
<i>too overprotective
of an environment.</i>

645
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,741
<i>It's the hygiene hypothesis,</i>

646
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,180
<i>why there's so much autoimmune
disease in the developed world,</i>

647
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,877
and almost none in
the developing world.

648
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:56,078
<i>The worms were keeping
the Crohn's in check,</i>

649
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,988
teaching his immune system what it should've
learned from eating dirt growing up.

650
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,287
Once you killed them,
it started killing him.

651
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:08,096
So his life of filth wasn't the
problem, the clean living was.

652
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,729
We'll start him
on methylprednisolone.

653
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:12,598
And some helminths.

654
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:16,800
Worms. Cool, huh?

655
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:20,606
Best out of three?

656
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:27,109
<i>Have you been
a bad boy?</i>

657
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,280
<i>Yeah, that's...</i>

658
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:40,858
I want to be on the team.

659
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,263
Good news for your wife.

660
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,091
Thanks for the sarcasm.

661
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:48,764
I reorganized my life
to spend more time with her,

662
00:36:48,839 --> 00:36:51,467
but apparently I don't love
her as much as I thought.

663
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,442
Or you love her more.

664
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,243
This job gives you the thrill you
used to find through philandering.

665
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,809
Better to cheat with
a beaker and an MRI

666
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,515
than one of your platinum-blonde
plastic surgery patients.

667
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,386
I'll let you know.

668
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,079
I told House I want
to work for him again.

669
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,377
Stay on the team.

670
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:37,013
You were always
more into it than I was,

671
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,784
more interested
in diagnostics.

672
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,516
Unless House was right
about why you want out.

673
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:55,395
Four for four.

674
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,446
I was in love with you.

675
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,207
I was an idiot.

676
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:10,487
Tried to be like you,
tried to understand you,

677
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:13,614
because I thought
I could heal you.

678
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,123
You almost killed
that patient.

679
00:38:19,196 --> 00:38:21,164
If almost not saving
his life means...

680
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,393
You knew the diagnosis
a long time ago.

681
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,493
You risked another patient's
life to bait your old team.

682
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,037
Another one?

683
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:29,504
You did kill Dibala.

684
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:33,366
By playing God and
teaching us to do the same.

685
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,036
I taught you to think for yourselves.

686
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,374
You don't even think
of them as people,

687
00:38:36,447 --> 00:38:38,972
they're just lab rats
for your little puzzles.

688
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,312
You celebrate
their humanity,

689
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,750
I'd rather solve those little
puzzles and save their lives.

690
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,983
Motives do matter.
Lives can't come second.

691
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,719
The patient is alive.
That's what matters.

692
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,226
Not to you.

693
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:54,094
All you care about is that Taub
and Thirteen fell for your game.

694
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,259
You'll poison them
just like you poisoned Chase.

695
00:38:58,302 --> 00:39:02,170
Your husband killed a patient
and you're breaking up with me?

696
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,265
You ruined him,

697
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,342
so he can't even see
right from wrong,

698
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:15,950
can't even see the sanctity
of a human life any more.

699
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:24,318
I loved you,
and I loved Chase.

700
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:28,564
I'm sorry for you both,

701
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,129
for who you've
become because

702
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,133
there's no way back
for either of you.

703
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:46,440
Any idea where I can get a great
big "Mission Accomplished" banner?

704
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:53,206
Got my sanity back, my
license back, and now...

705
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,080
You're kidding.
All of them?

706
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,849
Three out of four,

707
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,517
which is almost as good
as four out of five.

708
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:03,787
Who was the...
Cameron.

709
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,523
Wow. I can't believe it.

710
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:11,432
I mean, really.
I can't believe it.

711
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,765
You were right, House.
Good for you.

712
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,931
Yeah. It is.

713
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:25,846
She's broken up with Chase, and
she's leaving the hospital. Still,

714
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,714
three out of four
ain't bad.
