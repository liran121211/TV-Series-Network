1
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,490
My lords and ladies!

2
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:32,222
Today, your Queen
will choose her champion.

3
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:36,360
Here he will battle
for not only her honor,

4
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:39,068
but for a title
of his own.

5
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:45,343
But only if he can defeat
the Captain of my Guard,

6
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,443
Sir Horace the Black!

7
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,818
Sir William, wouldst
thou fight for my honor?

8
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,921
To the death,
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:07,494
Let's hope it does not
come to that, eh?

10
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,236
I choose Sir William
as my champion.

11
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,970
Attack from
his left side.

12
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,015
I saw his squire bandaging
that shoulder this morning.

13
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,282
I wish thee
luck and strength.

14
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,017
I fear I shall need
all I can get.

15
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,428
The Captain of my Guard,
Sir Horace the Black!

16
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:04,180
Are you sure you wouldn't like to
reconsider your choice, my Queen?

17
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,685
I believe I chose rightly, my King.

18
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,029
Brave knights, in the honored
tradition of our land, have at ye!

19
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:52,165
I fear you chose
most poorly, my love.

20
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:56,032
William! William!
William! William!

21
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:04,200
William! William!
William! William!

22
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:07,769
William?
What is it?

23
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,752
Your eyes.

24
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,322
William.

25
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:38,137
We need an ambulance
at the Camden Fairgrounds.

26
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,935
You're new.

27
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,862
You're naked.

28
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,874
And for the record,
a little bit cold.

29
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,035
I'm sorry, I didn't know
that anyone was home.

30
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,512
James had an early call,
and I was just leaving.

31
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,346
Without breakfast?

32
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,078
I'm fine, thanks.
I'm Sam, by the way.

33
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,179
House. Nice to meet you.

34
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,779
It'd be nicer
if you put this on.

35
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,085
So you and Wilson...

36
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,321
Thought you were staying
in New York last night.

37
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:07,832
Sorry, must have missed the "if this trailer be a
- rocking" sign out front.

38
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,434
I'm really late, so...

39
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:15,836
If there's any chance that we
can pretend this never happened,

40
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:18,769
I'd be completely
fine with that.

41
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,454
An eight-year-old
with bleeding ears.

42
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:34,721
I'll see your bleeding ears and raise
you a total muscular degeneration.

43
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,055
What the hell?

44
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,692
I had a dream like this
once. It didn't end well.

45
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,971
Huzzah,
my loyal peasants.

46
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:47,335
House,
what are you doing?

47
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,001
Filling in for Rabbi Shmuhl
at the Goldstein Bris.

48
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,242
While I'm busy, you all can check
out the knight down in the ER,

49
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,374
who instead of seizing
the throne, just seized.

50
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,213
He works at
a Renaissance festival?

51
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,720
Doesn't work there,
he lives there.

52
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,053
He's part of a wonderful little troupe

53
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,592
who spend their weekends
re-enacting a nobler age

54
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,595
when people crapped in the streets and
Thirteen would've been a grandmother.

55
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:13,791
Weeks, not weekends. Says here
he's been camping out for a month.

56
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,794
Try doing that
with a pen.

57
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,500
Why don't you put that down
before you kill one of us?

58
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,941
Better idea. Why don't you
give me something I can use

59
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:26,103
so I won't feel
the need to?

60
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,512
Seizure right after a fight
obviously suggests concussion.

61
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:32,415
Obviously it isn't, or the
ER wouldn't have called House.

62
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,079
A full suit of armor would
protect against visible trauma,

63
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,712
but not transmitted
concussive force.

64
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,155
Could be a subdural
hematoma.

65
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:41,557
You're forgetting
to demonize.

66
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,491
An evil, satanic
subdural hematoma.

67
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:49,228
No, two demon eyes.
Hemorrhaging in the sclerae.

68
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,701
Could be an allergic reaction to
something from the Renaissance fair.

69
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,671
Which is why we need to
check out Middle Earth.

70
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,207
Foreman, take Frodo and
break bread with the Hobbits.

71
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,708
I still think a hematoma is more likely.

72
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,507
That's why you and Chase
are gonna get an MRI.

73
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,604
But you just...

74
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,512
I said Frodo,
not Gollum.

75
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:07,880
Is he saying I have
short legs or hairy feet?

76
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,478
I don't even know
who Frodo is.

77
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,151
Who's the chick, and
why are you hiding her?

78
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,992
You were home
last night?

79
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,727
And this morning. I bumped
into your babe naked.

80
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:23,792
I told you to stay
out of my bathroom.

81
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,996
I was in the kitchen.

82
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,971
She was naked in the
kitchen? I was naked.

83
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,199
Why were you naked
in the kitchen?

84
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,434
That's not important
right now.

85
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,307
What is, is why you didn't want
me to meet her in the first place.

86
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,107
Is she married?
No.

87
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,306
Patient?

88
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,643
I don't have time
for this.

89
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:38,377
She used to be a man.
House!

90
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,975
She wants to be a man.

91
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,579
Sam is a man's name,
short for...

92
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,558
Samantha.

93
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,265
The soulless harpy you were
married to before we met.

94
00:08:55,902 --> 00:08:57,893
People change, House.

95
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,770
Sure. They get older, their
ovaries start drying up

96
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,604
and nice guys like you
look attractive again.

97
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,837
Listen, I know that in
your own demented way,

98
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,971
you think you're looking
out for me. But I have this.

99
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:12,177
By "this" you mean a sinking
feeling in the pit of the stomach.

100
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,014
Fine, I get it.

101
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:17,021
It's your life, you go
screw it up. I can wait.

102
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,420
For what?

103
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,822
To tell you,
"I told you so. "

104
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:30,361
No signs of a hematoma.
Brain looks completely normal.

105
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:34,270
Normal, except for the fact
that he likes to play dress-up.

106
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,031
My uncle used to pretend
that he was King Leopold.

107
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:38,906
<i>I'm not pretending.</i>

108
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,411
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

109
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,083
<i>But you don't really think
you're a knight, do you?</i>

110
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:52,249
Being a knight isn't a
game, it's a lifestyle,

111
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,419
<i>and we do it every day, not
just when we play dress-up.</i>

112
00:09:55,494 --> 00:10:01,592
<i>We live by a code, and uphold ideals
like loyalty, courage, humility.</i>

113
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:05,398
And the part where you beat the
crap out of each other in armor?

114
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:09,268
<i>That we do for fun. At least
it was up until yesterday.</i>

115
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:13,767
<i>Are we almost done?
I'm feeling...</i>

116
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,773
Let's get him out of there
before he aspirates.

117
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,190
Anything abnormal
on the MRI?

118
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:34,996
God's teeth! What strange
manner of garments be these?

119
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,235
Okay. We'll be back soon.

120
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,603
He consorts with tiny demons in
his hand. 'Tis witchcraft, I say.

121
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:44,268
Do I look like I'm here
to play pretend with you?

122
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,636
Relax.
It's not personal.

123
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,650
Just tell them you're a
time traveler or something.

124
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:54,148
Well, if we're gonna be here,
we might as well enjoy it.

125
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,313
Our knight just vomited
inside the MRI.

126
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,187
Taub thinks it might
be food poisoning.

127
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:05,686
Which shouldn't
be surprising.

128
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:09,791
Outdoor latrines, food prep
going on next to livestock.

129
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,200
I hear you wish to speak with
me concerning Sir William.

130
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,334
How faireth he?

131
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,675
Not well,
or we wouldn't be here.

132
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,607
A pox indeed is...
Miles.

133
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:26,947
We just thought
it was a concussion.

134
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,486
He's going to be
okay, right?

135
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:31,489
We need to look at the
area he was camping out in.

136
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,890
And you might want to invest into
a dental plan for the kingdom.

137
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,787
You sure he got sick
from something here?

138
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,458
I'm not sure of anything, yet, but...

139
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,529
What do you make of this?

140
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:51,766
Mmm.
Looks like vomit.

141
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:54,142
Means he was showing
symptoms prior to the fight.

142
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,511
True, but I meant this.

143
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:01,512
Oh. It's a cow eye from the
night before the tournament.

144
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:04,488
He makes the knights eat all
kinds of disgusting stuff.

145
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,682
Why?

146
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,123
<i>Got the idea
from Fear Factor.</i>

147
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,184
Why didn't he mention it when
he checked into the hospital?

148
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,786
I make them all take an oath
of secrecy about the ritual.

149
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,856
William tends to take his role
as a knight very seriously.

150
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,962
You think that's what
caused him to pass out?

151
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,303
It's not exactly sanitary.

152
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,870
Fun stuff never is.

153
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:36,719
Serious bacterial food poisoning
explains seizure and vomiting.

154
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,086
A lumbar puncture
could confirm.

155
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,749
Except it's not
food poisoning.

156
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:43,226
If it was, the ER would
look like Camelot right now.

157
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,388
All it takes is
one bad eyeball.

158
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:49,525
Or testicle, cow brain,
or my personal favorite,

159
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:53,332
pig rectum with a side
order of sphincter.

160
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,736
I think they call that
breakfast in Australia.

161
00:12:55,808 --> 00:12:58,504
No one else was sick because
they weren't allergic like he was.

162
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:00,442
To what? That's what I
sent you to Middle Earth

163
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,775
to find out.

164
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,114
Run scratch tests with the
samples you brought back.

165
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,913
That's gonna take time,
and he's getting worse.

166
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,454
So treat him with
epinephrine, too.

167
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,957
This should prevent
any more symptoms

168
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,363
until we can figure out
what it is you're allergic to.

169
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:22,730
Thanks.

170
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,532
I told you, you shouldn't
have eaten all that stuff.

171
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:26,628
You know,
you don't have to stay.

172
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:29,765
I'm sure you and Miles are crazy
busy, what with the wedding and all.

173
00:13:29,842 --> 00:13:31,707
Miles said we could
postpone it until...

174
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,838
Don't worry, I'll be fine. I'll be there.
I just hope you have a good photographer.

175
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,974
'Cause I don't think the standard
red-eye filter's going to work on these.

176
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,484
I need
your right arm.

177
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,161
That feels...
Feels strange.

178
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,156
What is it?
What's wrong?

179
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,065
His heart rate's
become irregular.

180
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,396
My chest hurts. It feels
like it's going to explode.

181
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,735
Tachycardia. We need to
shock him back into rhythm.

182
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,103
Oh, my God,
William...

183
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,006
I need his gown open.

184
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,305
What is that?
What is that stuff?

185
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,506
I don't know.

186
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,423
It's definitely
not an allergy,

187
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,654
or the epi would have helped
him, not made him worse.

188
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:28,723
Unless he's allergic and allergic
to the cure. Sodium bisulfite,

189
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:32,362
the preservative that keeps epi
peppy, can cause tachycardia.

190
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,497
So can Wolff-Parkinson-
White syndrome,

191
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:36,598
and it also causes
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

192
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,610
And abnormal electrical pathways in
the heart, which could cause seizures.

193
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:41,908
But not skin infections.

194
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,575
There is an infection that can
cause skin and neurological damage

195
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,709
and spreads rapidly
without treatment.

196
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:49,845
Methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus?

197
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,447
Lord have MRSA.

198
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:56,426
You weren't wearing gloves when we
shocked his heart back into rhythm.

199
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,298
I'm sure you'll be fine. You two,
get a sample to the lab to confirm.

200
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,428
You get the knight into
isolation and on IV antibiotics.

201
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,529
You, stay away from me.

202
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:18,883
Need to talk.
About the MRSA?

203
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,942
I know. We're...
MRSA, shmrsa.

204
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,384
Something important.

205
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,446
Something you think is more important
than a potentially lethal bacteria

206
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:28,287
spreading like wildfire
through my hospital?

207
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:32,091
Well, that narrows it down to
something personal and stupid.

208
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,389
Wilson.
Theory confirmed.

209
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,661
He is dating his first wife, I know.

210
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,162
I don't believe it.

211
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:41,003
That he didn't ask
your permission first?

212
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:44,907
No, that he's actually capable
of keeping a secret from me.

213
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:48,105
Well, you'd be surprised how many
things Wilson doesn't tell you.

214
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,913
Would I? Like how you slept with
your father's best friend? Or...

215
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:54,077
I'm going to kill him.

216
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:55,711
You need to break them up.

217
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,546
Forget it.

218
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,022
So you'd rather
sit back and watch

219
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:02,390
while the evil blonde gorges
on Wilson's tender flesh

220
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,589
and then tosses out his bones
like she did the last time?

221
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,632
You remember what
he was like after that?

222
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,227
Yes, I do.

223
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,463
Well, then
do something.

224
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,039
God knows he's not gonna listen to me.

225
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,803
You, on the other hand, have
decades of experience dating

226
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,242
and being attracted
to losers.

227
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,437
Obviously I don't
include myself.

228
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,039
You know what happens when you interfere
in other people's relationships?

229
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,551
Of course,
I do it all the time.

230
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:30,244
Hmm. I see your point.

231
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,517
That is why
I'm staying out of this.

232
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:36,725
You force him to choose,
you might not like the answer.

233
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,932
He doesn't seem to be
in as much pain any more.

234
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,132
That's good.

235
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:52,699
But we won't be out of the woods for
sure until the blisters start to recede.

236
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,941
I'm really thirsty.
You mind getting me a soda?

237
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:58,107
Sure.
I'll be right back.

238
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:03,878
What's wrong?

239
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,755
The pain in my chest,
it's getting worse.

240
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,383
Just now?
No.

241
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:12,089
I didn't want
to worry her.

242
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,299
So how long have you
been in love with her?

243
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,835
What? No,
we're just friends.

244
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:19,732
Seriously.

245
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,376
Since the first time
I saw her.

246
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,207
Why don't you tell her?

247
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,574
She's engaged
to my friend.

248
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:29,807
The King?

249
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,282
Haven't seen him visiting
or sitting by your bedside.

250
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,908
He has responsibilities.

251
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,681
Yeah? I'm guessing
the Queen does, too.

252
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:40,191
What kind of knight
steals his friend's bride?

253
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:43,686
I hate that
I even think about it.

254
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,594
You're not a knight.
You're just a guy.

255
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,870
But I want to be
more than that.

256
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,440
Your chest?

257
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:58,874
No, my back.

258
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,310
Feels like there's
a knife in it.

259
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:04,144
Is the infection spreading?

260
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:05,444
<i>It's not MRSA.</i>

261
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,749
It looks like some sort
of clostridial organism.

262
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:13,821
Question is, which type of
clostridium? There's hundreds.

263
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:15,651
C. Perfringens?

264
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,762
Wouldn't account for his other
symptoms. C. Tetani, on the other hand?

265
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,333
Tetanus? He would have
been inoculated against it.

266
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:24,767
So he cut himself and
didn't get a booster shot.

267
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:28,931
The guy fights people with swords
for fun, no one said he's smart.

268
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:30,668
They don't just
fight for fun.

269
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,369
They fight to prove
their bravery.

270
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:35,672
You buying this honor stuff?

271
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:39,617
Fighting is not brave,
it's just stupid.

272
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:41,515
You would say that.

273
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,752
You think I've never
been in a fight?

274
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,312
No, I just think
you've never won one.

275
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,824
I took on three guys
in college once.

276
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,952
Hope they
bought you dinner first.

277
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,090
It's not MRSA.
I know.

278
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,721
It's poison ivy.
Poison ivy?

279
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,267
A severe reaction
could cause the blisters

280
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,768
and maybe irritate his eyes
enough to cause the hemorrhaging,

281
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:00,964
but the chest pain
and seizures?

282
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,803
They have bonfires
every night.

283
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,843
Burning leaves
aerosolizes the oil.

284
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,941
You've seen what it's done
to the outside of his body,

285
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:09,242
imagine what it's doing to
his lungs and his sinuses.

286
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,009
Okay, maybe
it remotely fits,

287
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,643
but I'd rather go with scientific
evidence than with your gut.

288
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,678
How about this?

289
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,082
Apparently,
it's all over his sword.

290
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,928
It's his heart rate again!

291
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,554
How fast is it? It's
slowing. Why aren't you...

292
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,189
It's not MRSA.

293
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,960
I'm giving him 12 cc's
of epinephrine.

294
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,969
He tested positive.
You'll blow his heart out.

295
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,904
If it slows any more,
it's going to stop.

296
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,542
I told you!

297
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,409
And I told you.

298
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,922
That wasn't caused
by poison ivy.

299
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,187
Or epinephrine.

300
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:59,628
Means the heart problem we ruled
out, we now have to rule back in.

301
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:02,256
We found clostridium
bacteria in the skin samples.

302
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,597
Clostridium's in dirt
and basically harmless.

303
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,365
But opportunistic, if his
immune system was depressed.

304
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,236
Leukemia?
He would've had symptoms

305
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:10,866
way before the
Renaissance festival.

306
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,276
Which is true of anything that
would compromise his immune system.

307
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,712
Which means it has to be some
other environmental toxin.

308
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,809
Yesterday he was a healthy
knight, today he's sleeping beauty.

309
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:22,147
Nothing else fits.

310
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,050
Trichinosis from
eating infected meat?

311
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:25,384
We already ruled
out food poisoning.

312
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:28,324
Both the butcher shop and the food
stands at the fair were totally clean.

313
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,292
Then he ate the poison
apple somewhere else,

314
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,560
or maybe you just missed it.

315
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,000
Start treatment for trichinosis
and confirm with a muscle biopsy.

316
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,136
Hey.

317
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,446
I can't believe I'm
about to say this. Sam...

318
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,073
Told you so.

319
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,950
No, she didn't dump me. She
wants to get to know you better.

320
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,581
Damn it! I never should
have let her see me naked.

321
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,990
It goes against all my
instincts, but I said all right.

322
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,152
Why?

323
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,128
She thinks I was hiding her from you.

324
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,254
You were.

325
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,662
I don't want
her to know.

326
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:12,633
You're asking me to condone a
relationship based on lies and mistrust?

327
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,303
Yeah.

328
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,431
When and where?

329
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,305
Tonight. Venezia. 8:00.

330
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,468
What am I gonna wear?

331
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,205
All my cereal boxes
are at the cleaners.

332
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,275
House, listen.

333
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,911
I know you're
worried about me.

334
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,749
And I also know that
that kind of unselfishness

335
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,153
doesn't come
naturally to you.

336
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:35,389
But I don't want your help.
I don't need your help.

337
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:40,957
Just come to dinner and
be your usual selfish self.

338
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,331
How could I say no?

339
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,542
Miles said
he'd stop by later.

340
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,373
Tell him not to.

341
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,540
I don't want to be
seen like this.

342
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:58,875
You're sick. That's
nothing to be ashamed of.

343
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,945
Unless you're saying
you want me to leave?

344
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,316
No, don't.

345
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,247
I think he's saying it's
different with you, Shannon.

346
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,021
It's a guy thing. They don't like
showing weakness in front of each other.

347
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,687
Right, William?

348
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,988
Right. Maybe when I'm
feeling a little better.

349
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:21,236
I'm going to take a small sample
of your muscle tissue here.

350
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,806
Do you mind waiting outside for this?

351
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,034
Don't hurt him.

352
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,872
He's safe with me.

353
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,682
I thought you were
going to tell her.

354
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:36,680
Not my call, but if you ask
me, she's waiting for you to.

355
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:39,480
Knights are supposed
to be selfless.

356
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:44,021
Right, they conquered countries
and built castles by being selfless.

357
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:47,561
Bravery and loyalty are
great qualities for soldiers.

358
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:51,466
If you want to be king, sometimes you
have to be willing to take what's yours.

359
00:22:56,441 --> 00:22:57,703
She's not mine.

360
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,304
She's not his either.
Not yet.

361
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,581
It's just dinner. Relax.

362
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,251
Trust me, there is no "just"
when House is involved.

363
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,055
We're in the middle
of a restaurant.

364
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,257
What could he possibly do?

365
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,594
That.

366
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,104
Sorry we're late,
but you know girls.

367
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,165
Always fiddling with
the hair and the makeup.

368
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,942
James, Sam,
this is Sarah.

369
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,603
It's nice to meet you.
Horace has told me...

370
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
House.

371
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:40,411
House has told me
all about you.

372
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,781
Nice to meet you.

373
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:48,858
What's the diagnosis?

374
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:53,425
His muscle biopsy's clean.
It's not trichinosis.

375
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,624
House was wrong.
This is not environmental.

376
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:59,898
Or we screwed up and missed
something at the Renaissance fair.

377
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,097
You think we did?

378
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,835
No, but I think
House will think we did.

379
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,235
What could we
have missed?

380
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,273
Fungal infection?

381
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,983
There's nothing in his blood work
even remotely suggesting that.

382
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,177
But it fits
the symptoms.

383
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:17,153
You want to retest every
sample we took for spores?

384
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,785
We'll be here all night.

385
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:21,883
Have you noticed how much
pain he's been in lately?

386
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,122
And that's relevant how?

387
00:24:24,196 --> 00:24:28,030
Extra pain means extra
cranky, means off his game.

388
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,260
He's not gonna accept
this isn't environmental

389
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,666
unless we give
him no choice.

390
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:41,804
I cannot believe
you're from Bloomington.

391
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,713
I know.
Isn't it amazing?

392
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,375
Yeah. Delightful.

393
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,545
Ignore him. He's just
upset that we're having fun.

394
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,286
Do you remember
that little bakery,

395
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,688
the one with the
amazing cupcakes?

396
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,225
Gino's.
Oh, yes!

397
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:56,555
First stop every
time I go home.

398
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,095
Me, too.

399
00:24:58,463 --> 00:24:59,691
Remember
that strip club?

400
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:02,733
Girl, I used to work at that strip club.

401
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,630
Where does it hurt,
William?

402
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,572
My legs. It feels
like they're on fire.

403
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,789
Rhabdomyolysis
means his kidneys are failing.

404
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,021
Also means it's not
environmental. We need to move on.

405
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,792
I recommend we start with a full
cancer work-up, starting with the...

406
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,163
Which one of you
checked out the apartment?

407
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,258
House...

408
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:38,529
His symptoms fit
an environmental...

409
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,161
The test results
don't. We redid...

410
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,069
Search the apartment.

411
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,334
He hasn't been there
in three weeks.

412
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,308
Go! Now!

413
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,346
I liked him better
when he was on Vicodin.

414
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:52,974
You and Thirteen
check out his place.

415
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,143
While you're wasting your time,
we'll ultrasound the liver.

416
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:58,586
If it's cancer, it's as
good a place as any to start.

417
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:04,726
Hey.
Hey.

418
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,670
Heard House met Sam.

419
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,664
The first time
he was naked.

420
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,572
The second time, he brought a
transvestite prostitute to dinner.

421
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,610
Overall,
it could've been worse.

422
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,272
Great.

423
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,644
That's your reaction?

424
00:26:25,717 --> 00:26:26,809
What?

425
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,944
Nudity, prostitutes...

426
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,685
Sorry. Preoccupied.

427
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,717
House said something
to you, didn't he?

428
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,389
No. He didn't.

429
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,804
It is a little crazy, though.
I mean, isn't it?

430
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,342
I mean, things seem
to be going great,

431
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:58,246
but they seemed to be
going great 12 years ago.

432
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,840
The good things
are still good.

433
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,182
She's still smart,
funny, gets me.

434
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:03,481
And she's less competitive.

435
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:07,056
Either she's changed or I've
changed, but either way...

436
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:10,018
Am I out of my mind?

437
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,062
You never know
what can happen.

438
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,692
Might as well
give it a chance.

439
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,934
Yeah.

440
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,609
Looks
like you were right.

441
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:33,609
Tumors, dozens of them
inside and on the surface.

442
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,678
Pull in closer.

443
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,158
See that?

444
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,020
What is that?

445
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,793
I don't know, but it's
definitely not cancer.

446
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:07,978
Kitchen's clean.

447
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,848
Bedroom as well.

448
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:13,015
Most dangerous thing in his
medicine cabinet was dental floss.

449
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,517
It's locked.
Key wasn't on his ring.

450
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,256
You honestly
want to go back

451
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,492
and tell House we didn't check
every square inch of this place?

452
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:23,090
Of course not.

453
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:40,881
My hero.

454
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,697
What the hell is this?

455
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,597
Either a secret
entrance to Hogwarts

456
00:29:00,271 --> 00:29:03,866
or our knight
is a witch.

457
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,949
Our knight is into some
seriously creepy stuff.

458
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,355
He claims it's
just sugar water,

459
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,189
but we sent the rest down
to the lab for testing.

460
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,421
You think
he poisoned himself?

461
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,963
It's not poison. We would have
picked it up in his blood work.

462
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,090
Not if it collected
slowly in his liver

463
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,862
and it all started leaking
into his system at once.

464
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:34,131
These tumors
that aren't tumors,

465
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,469
what if they're focal hepatic
lesions filled with blood?

466
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:39,975
Every time one explodes, it'd
be releasing another dose.

467
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,375
Of what?

468
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,976
<i>Plumbum nigrum.</i>

469
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,416
You putting a hex
on someone?

470
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:50,215
It's Latin for
black lead.

471
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,520
Our knightlwarlock apparently
also dabbles in alchemy.

472
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,657
Lead poisoning?

473
00:29:56,761 --> 00:30:00,094
Seizures, paralysis, weak immune
system and eventually coma.

474
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,066
Biopsy the cysts,
you'll find your lead.

475
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,372
You think we'll
make the 7:30?

476
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:15,435
I'm sorry. If I don't change, I'm
gonna feel like I'm at work all night.

477
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:16,912
Yeah, I remember.

478
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,039
Is it a problem?

479
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,781
Not at all.

480
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:23,682
In fact, if we hurry...

481
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:28,824
We will definitely
not make the 7:30.

482
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:30,793
Well, there's
always the 9:40.

483
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,200
Or not.

484
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,606
Shouldn't you be
at the hospital?

485
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,445
Wouldn't need a team if I did
all the work, now, would I?

486
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:55,676
Plus, I had to
make you dinner.

487
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:56,742
We have plans.

488
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:59,713
Bet your plans
don't taste like this.

489
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,487
Don't!

490
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:06,627
House, whatever it is
that you're up to...

491
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:09,232
I'm trying to be nice.

492
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:16,005
What I did the other night
was juvenile. I'm sorry.

493
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:31,546
Yeah.

494
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:32,885
Soufflé was amazing.

495
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:36,191
It's my mom's recipe. Everything
else, I got off the web.

496
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,287
Here's to the Internet.

497
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,854
Where I found
the lamb ragù

498
00:31:40,932 --> 00:31:43,457
and you two found
each other. Again.

499
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,661
Well, it wasn't
just the Internet.

500
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,967
Yeah, more like
divorce, depression,

501
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,974
therapy, more therapy,
then the Internet.

502
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,134
Yeah.

503
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,503
And here we are.

504
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,603
Exactly.
And here we are.

505
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:03,153
Well, I need to go
to the bathroom.

506
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,382
I think you're old enough now, but if
you'd like me to come along with you...

507
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,392
I mean, is it safe
to leave the two of you?

508
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,018
Come on, James,
enough already.

509
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,563
Yeah, James.
I cook in peace.

510
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,332
Okay. Be right back.

511
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,509
You're a cold-hearted bitch
who ripped his heart out.

512
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:32,843
I watched him struggle for years
to overcome the damage you did,

513
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,215
and there's no way I'm just
gonna let you reel him back in

514
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,618
so you can do it
all over again.

515
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,683
And all this?

516
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,093
Phase two of getting
to know my enemy.

517
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:50,323
You're wrong about me.

518
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,266
But I'm glad now I don't
have to pretend I like you,

519
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,534
except for when James
is standing next to me.

520
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,642
Same here. The only difference
is, I'll outlast you.

521
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:05,413
And scene.

522
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,550
Well, it's too late
for the movie.

523
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:11,781
Wanna see
what's on TV?

524
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,083
Absolutely.

525
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,122
Love to.

526
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,233
There wasn't any lead present in
his blood work or liver biopsy.

527
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,294
And his heart rate and BP
are getting even more erratic.

528
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,239
We had to shock it back into
rhythm twice during the night.

529
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,137
There's only one
thing left to do.

530
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,385
We're wasting our time.

531
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,653
Actually, I've already
gotten good value.

532
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,719
I told you there's nothing here that
could've caused any of his symptoms.

533
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,265
No, you told me that you
couldn't find anything here

534
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,459
that could be causing his symptoms.

535
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,798
And now we're gonna find something
new because we're in costume?

536
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,464
We looked everywhere.
Tested everything.

537
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:05,407
Just because Wilson's acting
stupid doesn't mean we are.

538
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:07,637
You think he's
making a mistake?

539
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,772
Of course. But he'll figure
it out sooner or later.

540
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,645
Hopefully after a few
weeks of great sex.

541
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,617
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

542
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,277
Wilson's not like us.

543
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,754
He cares too much about
people and their feelings.

544
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:19,915
Thanks for the compliment.

545
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,255
The code that our
knight claims to live by,

546
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:26,626
all that crap about honor and
chivalry, Wilson's naturally like that.

547
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,755
Which is why he is...

548
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,299
A great guy.

549
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,131
...a sucker and a target.
Someone's got to look out for him.

550
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,534
You smell that?

551
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,336
Yeah, it's the
apothecary shop,

552
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,843
and, yes, Foreman
and I already...

553
00:34:49,954 --> 00:34:51,444
I cry your pardon, sir.

554
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,053
You know what this is?

555
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,150
Why, that's lavender.

556
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:57,694
Try rose hips.

557
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,328
Both harmless.
Who cares?

558
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,660
It could be cyanide,
as far as he knows.

559
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,300
How about this?

560
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,200
Be nothing but
St John's wort.

561
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,637
Wrong again.
Black Cohosh.

562
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:13,408
My uncle owns the shop.
I just started apprenticing.

563
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,309
What's the big deal?

564
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:20,209
Hey, I just
organized all that.

565
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,522
You know what this is?

566
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:28,024
A wild carrot?

567
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:32,556
It's hemlock,
you embossed carbuncle.

568
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,989
That's hemlock?
You sure?

569
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,228
Did you sell it
to anyone?

570
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,662
It's poison.
Think hard.

571
00:35:43,107 --> 00:35:44,540
It was just one branch.

572
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,137
You sold it
to Sir William.

573
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:49,975
No. To the King.

574
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,516
It's the only part of the
environment you didn't check.

575
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,454
The people living in it.

576
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,991
What's going on?
Why can't we see William?

577
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:15,164
Because you poisoned him,
your royal anus, with this.

578
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,937
Wild carrots?

579
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,100
Hemlock.

580
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,637
I need to know how much you
used and how you prepared it.

581
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,734
You did something
to William?

582
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:22,836
No, of course not.

583
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:26,441
He's still alive. You want to avoid
a murder charge, start talking fast.

584
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:29,452
The apothecary's willing to testify
that you're the only one he gave it to.

585
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,455
Okay. Yeah, maybe I bought
it for the food challenge,

586
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:33,751
but I didn't know
that was hemlock.

587
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:35,883
If it was for
the challenge,

588
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,224
why is Wee Willy the
only knight who's dying?

589
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,285
I don't know.

590
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,991
I'm telling you, I didn't know.
Why would I want to hurt William?

591
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,824
I can think of at
least one reason.

592
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:48,929
Miles, please, whatever happened,
just tell them the truth.

593
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:50,166
I am.

594
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:52,772
I swear.

595
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,575
We ran a gas
chromatography on his blood,

596
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,742
found trace amounts
of piperidine alkaloids.

597
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,285
The main markers
of hemlock intoxication.

598
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,616
Well, the good news is, we
now know what's wrong with you.

599
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:10,394
Bad news is, your king's precious
ideals were just pretend after all.

600
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:13,528
At least when it comes to guys
who get too close to his Queen.

601
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,922
It's not true.

602
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,035
I guess you've never
heard the expression,

603
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:21,298
"Gas chromatography
machines don't lie. "

604
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,202
Neither does Miles.

605
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,571
He's the best knight
I've ever known.

606
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,772
That's why
he was chosen king.

607
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:31,712
Miles is a jealous idiot,
and you're just an idiot.

608
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,046
Something's wrong.

609
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:37,417
We performed a gastric lavage and
administered activated charcoal,

610
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,547
but he's getting worse,
not better.

611
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:41,387
It's been in his
system two days.

612
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:42,926
We're lucky he's
lasted this long.

613
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,258
If it was hemlock,
he'd either be dead already

614
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,421
or getting better
with treatment.

615
00:37:46,497 --> 00:37:47,896
It's hemlock. We found it in his blood.

616
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,057
He may have had
some hemlock,

617
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:51,431
but it's not
what's killing him.

618
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,674
Don't do it,
whatever you're planning,

619
00:37:59,744 --> 00:38:01,211
especially if you're
gonna use that thing.

620
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,138
It was just sitting
in a stone...

621
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:09,616
Here. It's gonna cost extra 'cause of
the level of detail that you wanted.

622
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,247
Anything good? And by good,
I, of course, mean bad.

623
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:15,587
Nope. Pretty much
your typical life.

624
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,285
Married young,
got divorced.

625
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,886
Married a little less
young, got divorced.

626
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,728
She's been pretty successful in
everything she's done except marriage.

627
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,631
Well, there's gotta be
something I can use.

628
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,433
Maybe. Didn't read her shrink's
notes. Didn't seem right.

629
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:30,334
But stealing them did?

630
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:33,536
Whoa! I didn't steal them.
I found a way to obtain them.

631
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:38,380
Excuse me. I don't mean to
interrupt, but you got a minute?

632
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,809
Sure.

633
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,684
Oh, him? Yeah.
I was just leaving.

634
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,149
Careful, I have a sword.

635
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,088
I don't agree
with what you said,

636
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,793
but I understand
why you said it.

637
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,261
We were married young.
We both made mistakes.

638
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,131
And, yes, I did make
most of them.

639
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,106
But that was almost
a decade ago.

640
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:07,939
I'm sorry, is that the statutory
period for soul sucking?

641
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:11,547
I'm not asking you
to like me, House.

642
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,310
To be honest,
I think you're an ass,

643
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:16,251
but we do have
one thing in common.

644
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,219
We care about James.

645
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:22,123
So prove it and
dump him. Again.

646
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:24,922
You're pretty much insufferable
all the time, aren't you?

647
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:27,054
Sorry. Go on. And yes.

648
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,794
We just reconnected, we have
no idea where we're headed.

649
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:37,439
But is it really too much to ask
that you give us a chance to find out?

650
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,406
I'm sure I'll be seeing you around.

651
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,676
We did it.
Well, I did it.

652
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:23,279
What exactly did we do?

653
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,348
You do?

654
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,288
These aren't focal hepatic
lesions on his liver.

655
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,656
They're peliosis
hepatis lesions,

656
00:40:30,728 --> 00:40:33,993
which, in combination with an erratic
heart rate, usually indicates...

657
00:40:34,064 --> 00:40:36,362
Endocarditis, an infection
on his heart valve.

658
00:40:36,467 --> 00:40:39,527
Two major symptoms
of anabolic steroid abuse.

659
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,729
No, he wouldn't...

660
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,136
And the rhabdo
makes the third.

661
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,197
Our patient's a juicer.

662
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:48,068
The ancient poison accelerated
the damage of the modern poison.

663
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:52,142
Start treatment. Let the
king out of the tower.

664
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,618
How are you feeling?

665
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:01,817
Ashamed.

666
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,952
You should be.

667
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,923
You'll compromise your
ideals to win a fight,

668
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,694
but not to go for
the woman you love.

669
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,468
That was a game,
not real life.

670
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:17,698
I didn't...

671
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:19,766
Hurt anyone?
Try telling that to Shannon.

672
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:23,211
Or maybe I missed something
while she was crying by your bed.

673
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,245
You don't need
to win anyone's heart.

674
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:29,178
You just need
to ask for it.

675
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:41,123
Miles is a great guy.

676
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:43,993
He's rich, smart,
treats her well.

677
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:47,231
She's going to have
a great life with him.

678
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,804
With me?

679
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,067
I'd do everything
I could for her,

680
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,767
but even at my best,
it wouldn't be much.

681
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,709
