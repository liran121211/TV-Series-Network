00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:42,703
The question is, is this
a bad agenda or a good one?

349
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:44,938
<i>either you're trying
to screw with me,</i>

350
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:49,743
Or you're trying to show me
that you've really changed.

351
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:54,114
So which is it?
i'm dying to know.

352
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:03,223
What are you doing
for thanksgiving dinner?

353
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,161
Peace in our time.

354
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:12,833
It cost me 45 minutes
of clinic duty.

355
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:14,802
This is
a three-hour drive.

356
00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:16,470
<i>have you considered
the possibility</i>

357
00:15:16,538 --> 00:15:18,172
That this is
a fake address?

358
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:19,540
You think she'd send me
to a vacant lot

359
00:15:19,607 --> 00:15:20,507
For thanksgiving dinner?

360
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,608
If she's smart.

361
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:22,843
She is.

362
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:24,712
That's why i ran it
through motor vehicles.

363
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,847
Good as gold.

364
00:15:26,915 --> 00:15:28,248
This cannot end well.

365
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:29,616
I don't want it
to end well.

366
00:15:29,684 --> 00:15:31,819
<i>you should
come as my date.</i>

367
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:35,255
You're not gonna
want to miss this.

368
00:15:37,764 --> 00:15:39,932
The unstandard tox screen was
as clean as the standard one.

369
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,335
But we found vodka
stashed away in his place.

370
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:45,838
What's with the ties?

371
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:48,207
Makes me look adorably
non-threatening.

372
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:51,276
Party or party hearty?

373
00:15:51,344 --> 00:15:55,414
Liver failure would
explain all the symptoms.

374
00:15:55,482 --> 00:15:59,518
Party.

375
00:15:59,586 --> 00:16:03,422
So guy's a brainiac, and his
secret drug of choice is booze?

376
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,891
That's kind of pedestrian,
don't you think?

377
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,693
Talk to him.
he's a pedestrian guy.

<i>(foreman)

379
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,530
Liver biopsy can wait
until after thanksgiving.

380
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:13,065
Yes, assuming
the biopsy's gonna tell us

381
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:14,500
Exactly what we
expect it to tell us,

382
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:16,535
It can wait till
after new year's.

383

384

Same as me.
have a happy thanksgiving.

00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,652
I'm not an alcoholic.

391
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,220
Yes, you just hide vodka
around the house for fun.

392
00:16:35,288 --> 00:16:38,223
I drink, just not a lot.

393
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,993
Since when do you
drink at all?

394
00:16:41,061 --> 00:16:43,429
I have one shot when i get home
from work, baby, that's it.

395
00:16:43,496 --> 00:16:45,330
So why lie
to your wife about it?

396
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:47,032
<i>(sidas)
because it's
not important.</i>

397
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,967
What difference
does it make?

398
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:51,503
That you drink every day
by yourself?

399
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:53,072
I have one
lousy drink, okay?

400
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:55,507
Have you ever
seen me drunk? ever?

401
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:56,608
No, but you've
obviously been

402
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,010
Drinking enough
to hurt your liver.

403
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,581
<i>my liver is fine.
hold still.</i>

404
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:05,117
There we go.

405
00:17:05,185 --> 00:17:08,721

<i>she didn't know
if she should.</i>

467
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:09,468
She was trying to figure out
if i really have changed or...

468
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:13,939
If i'm just the same old s.o.b.
i've always been.

469
00:20:17,243 --> 00:20:21,346
But she always
gave me a chance.

470
00:20:21,414 --> 00:20:24,883
832 chances.

471
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:27,085
<i>and i used up

472
00:20:27,153 --> 00:20:28,287
<i>832's her limit.</i>

I'm pathetic.

477
00:20:48,608 --> 00:20:51,043

00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:29,719
Multiple myeloma.

No.

493
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,859

497
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,168
He hasn't been coughing.

498
00:21:45,236 --> 00:21:46,503
It's in his history,
and we found

499
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,171
A new bottle of cough syrup
in his medicine cabinet.

500
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:49,672
Cough could mean
goodpasture syndrome.

502
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,777
Start him on immunosuppressors

You can save your fight

00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:12,595
How long do i have to
be hooked up for?

510
00:22:12,663 --> 00:22:15,265
Four to six hours a day
until we see an improvement.

511
00:22:15,332 --> 00:22:16,633
What if you don't?

512
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,701
Then we keep doing it until
he gets a transplant.

513
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:20,036
<i>you were sure
it was his spleen,</i>

514
00:22:20,104 --> 00:22:22,071
And then you were sure
it was his liver,

515
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:23,440
<i>which he told you
it wasn't,</i>

516
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:24,874
<i>and now you're sure
it's his kidneys.</i>

517
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:26,242
<i>(thirteen)
it's definitely
his kidneys.</i>

518
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,778
We just don't know
why it's his kidneys.

519
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:35,385
Any word from cameron?

520
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:37,954
Nope.

521
00:22:38,022 --> 00:22:41,391
I started seeing a counselor
after my diagnosis.

522
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:43,526
She's really good.

523
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:45,562
Why does everyone assume
that everyone works

524
00:22:45,629 --> 00:22:47,363
In the exact same way?

525
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:48,898
We pretty much do.

526
00:22:48,966 --> 00:22:50,900
Our egos want us to think
we're all snowflakes,

527
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:54,170
No two alike, but really
we all want the same things.

528
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:56,105
Love, forgiveness...

529
00:22:56,173 --> 00:22:57,507
Chocolate.

530
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:01,110
Well, what i want is for
everyone to leave me alone.

531
00:23:01,178 --> 00:23:02,912
[elevator bell dings]
how do i get that?

532
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:16,493
What did you say
to lucas last night?

533
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,330
I know there were
a lot of consonants.

534
00:23:20,397 --> 00:23:23,967
I don't remember how i got here,
never mind what i said.

535
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:25,835
<i>well, i just
talked to him.</i>

536
00:23:25,903 --> 00:23:27,036
And he said he thought
it'd be better

537
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:29,205
If we stopped
seeing each other.

538
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:30,673
Said he didn't realize

539
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:33,610
How much there still was
between you and me,

540
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:38,147
And he didn't want to get
caught in the middle of us.

541
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:42,418
I was drunk.

542
00:23:42,486 --> 00:23:43,720
Whatever i said,
he can't really--

543
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:45,989
<i>i've had enough, house.</i>

544
00:23:46,056 --> 00:23:50,827
I actually felt bad
about scamming you.

545
00:23:50,895 --> 00:23:55,231
But then you lived down to
my expectations and then some.

546
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:03,239
There is no "us."

547
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:05,174
There never will be.

548
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,617
It worked.

549
00:24:14,685 --> 00:24:17,253
Please tell me you're talking
about a medical procedure.

550
00:24:17,321 --> 00:24:19,055
They split up
this morning.

551
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:20,590
You're the very first
one i've told.

552
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:23,426
And you think she'll
start dating you?

553
00:24:23,494 --> 00:24:25,595
I'm sure she hates you.

554
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:27,263
But her eyes say,

555
00:24:27,331 --> 00:24:29,899
"how will i ever pay you
for that tennis lesson?"

556
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,868
[sighs]
what a shame.

557
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:33,136
<i>they'll get over it.</i>

558
00:24:33,203 --> 00:24:34,337
I meant for you.

559
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:37,874
I'll get over it
faster than they do.

560
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:40,777
Can't believe
that lucas fell for my

561
00:24:40,844 --> 00:24:41,945
<i>"i never say this
because it's so personal</i>

562
00:24:42,012 --> 00:24:44,280
Except that i'm drunk"
profession of love.

563
00:24:44,348 --> 00:24:45,882
Second-oldest trick
in the book.

564
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,918
You're right. it's his fault
because he's stupid.

565
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:56,025
He certainly is.

566
00:25:03,434 --> 00:25:07,070
You're stupid.

567
00:25:07,137 --> 00:25:09,939
Well, i'm rubber,
and you're glue.

568
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:11,908
He's not pedestrian,
he's stupid.

569
00:25:11,976 --> 00:25:14,644
At least stupider
than he should be.

570
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:16,512
He's a dxm junkie.

571
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,814
Dextromethorphan.

572
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:19,682
<i>as in cough syrup?</i>

573
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,017
He wasn't taking it
for his cough.

574
00:25:21,085 --> 00:25:24,053
It's cheap, available
at your corner drug store,

575
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:28,124
And taken in high doses,
it's a dumb drug.

576
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,793
Dumb drug.
well, he obviously hasn't--

577
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:32,428
<i>he's smart
compared to you.</i>

578
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:36,032
He's a moron
compared to what he was.

579
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,836
"robotripping" lowers the iq.
it also causes brain damage.

580
00:25:39,903 --> 00:25:43,072
Unless taken with the proper
amount of ethanol.

581
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,508
About one drink per day.

582
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:48,277
<i>he wasn't
abusing the booze</i>

583
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:49,846
And taking the cough remedy
medicinally.

584
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:51,614
He was abusing
the cough meds,

585
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:54,651
And taking
the booze medicinally.

586
00:25:54,718 --> 00:25:56,152
Bravo.

587
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:58,554
Why would you do that?

588
00:25:58,622 --> 00:26:00,289
If you had a--

589
00:26:00,357 --> 00:26:02,091
A gift, why would you
just throw it away?

590
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,360
I didn't throw it away.

591
00:26:04,428 --> 00:26:06,362
I just turned it
down a little.

592
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,831
When my brain
was on low,

593
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:10,933
Everything didn't seem
so miserable anymore.

594
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:13,736
Life was bearable.

595
00:26:13,804 --> 00:26:15,738
I thought that
i did that.

596
00:26:15,806 --> 00:26:19,676
You do.

597
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:21,978
<i>(house)
long-term abuse of dxm
explains all your symptoms.</i>

598
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:25,481
Even--oh, sweet irony--
your cough.

599
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:27,650
<i>whole bowel lavage,
activated charcoal.</i>

600
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:30,687
<i>we get all traces of it
out of your system.</i>

601
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:33,056
You'll be the unhappiest
little courier in no time.

602
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:36,526
I don't think i can
live without it.

603
00:26:39,129 --> 00:26:41,764
You'd be surprised
what you can live without.

604
00:26:41,832 --> 00:26:43,166
Make him a genius.

605
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:49,833
I can't believe it.
he looks so much better already.

606
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,768
<i>we were thinking
about calling gq.</i>

607
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:57,672
Lavage has removed all traces
of dxm from his body.

608
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,007
You're drawing again.

609
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:01,009
<i>what is it?
just doodles.</i>

610
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,043
<i>no, it's not.</i>

611
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:06,114
Come on, jimmy,
i want to know.

612
00:27:06,182 --> 00:27:12,120
This is a toroidal
helicon plasma device.

613
00:27:12,188 --> 00:27:16,224
It determines
the amount of energy

614
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:21,730
Expended by
the subatomic particles.

615
00:27:21,797 --> 00:27:25,033
<i>i'm thirsty. could you
get me a juice or something?</i>

616
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,069
Yeah, of course.

617
00:27:28,137 --> 00:27:30,639
I'm so happy, jimmy.

618
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:39,981
I told you.

619
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:42,751
Do you know what the difference
between her iq and mine is?

620
00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:45,420
91 points.

621
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:47,656
In relation, she's closer
to a gibbon than she is to me.

622
00:27:47,723 --> 00:27:51,026
Having sex with her would be
an act of bestiality.

623
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:53,862
I assume you
didn't marry her

624
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,197
<i>for her skill
in applied physics.</i>

625
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,798
I just wish
she could spell it.

626
00:27:56,866 --> 00:27:59,401
You really think
you'd be happier

627
00:27:59,468 --> 00:28:01,469
With someone
who could spell better?

628
00:28:01,537 --> 00:28:03,738
No.

629
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:04,873
That's the problem.

630
00:28:04,941 --> 00:28:07,209
<i>i'm the one
who's a jerk.</i>

631
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:11,313
But i owe her everything.

632
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,784
I want to want
to be with her.

633
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:20,589
And when i'm clear, i...

634
00:28:20,656 --> 00:28:23,825
I can't.

635
00:28:23,893 --> 00:28:27,295
Fainting, dizziness,
shortness of breath?

636
00:28:27,363 --> 00:28:28,330
<i>sometimes.</i>

637
00:28:28,397 --> 00:28:30,932
Is the wait
always this long?

638
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,634
Only on days
that end in "day."

639
00:28:32,702 --> 00:28:34,336
Diarrhea, weight loss?

640
00:28:34,403 --> 00:28:36,104
A bit.

641
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,473
Don't you ever shave?

642
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:40,342
Yeah. once a week.
how 'bout you?

643
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:42,611
Stomach pain, tenderness?

644
00:28:42,678 --> 00:28:44,279
<i>every now and then.</i>

645
00:28:44,347 --> 00:28:46,147
Are you this rude
to all your patients?

646
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:48,083
Oh, yes. don't think
you're special.

647
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,320
So we've got a lot of vague,
unverifiable symptoms.

648
00:28:52,388 --> 00:28:54,923
Yet all the physical signs
are perfectly normal.

649
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:56,191
What do you think i have?

650
00:28:56,259 --> 00:28:59,027
I'm not sure,
but i think it's...

651
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:00,061
A lame job.

652
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:01,796
What?

653
00:29:01,864 --> 00:29:02,931
You're a rat.

654
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,933
Insurance company
sends you out

655
00:29:05,001 --> 00:29:06,668
To check on the quality
of medical care.
that's ridiculous.

656
00:29:06,736 --> 00:29:08,403
Is it really?

657
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:10,005
'cause you seem
a lot more interested

658
00:29:10,072 --> 00:29:11,539
In asking questions
than answering them.

659
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:13,575
Handwriting on your
medical records is obviously

660
00:29:13,643 --> 00:29:14,943
Not a doctor's 'cause
i can almost read it.

661
00:29:15,011 --> 00:29:16,411
And when you went out
for a urine sample,

662
00:29:16,479 --> 00:29:17,946
I looked in your purse.

663
00:29:18,014 --> 00:29:20,282
Found the list of questions
you were supposed to memorize

664
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:22,183
Before you came
to the clinic.

665
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:23,351
I was looking for gum.

666
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:24,953
You're an ass.

667
00:29:25,021 --> 00:29:26,154
Put it in your report.

668
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,822
I tell you what.

669
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,758
I'll give you 20 bucks
if you'll pretend that i'm not

670
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:32,794
When we leave this room.

671
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:36,865
Remember,
first ice, then heat.

672
00:29:36,932 --> 00:29:39,167
If you have any problems,
don't hesitate to call me.

673
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:43,505
Thank you, dr. house.

674
00:29:43,572 --> 00:29:45,707
Wait a second.
where's cuddy?

675
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:49,110
Gone for the day.

676
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:50,712
<i>(house)
hey, hey, hey!</i>

677
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,647
Sorry.

678
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:54,049
I can't remember
if i've mocked you yet

679
00:29:54,116 --> 00:29:56,284
For being a male nurse.

680
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,219
I think this counts.

681
00:29:58,287 --> 00:29:59,821
Fair enough.

682
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:05,593
That isn't
the man i married.

683
00:30:05,661 --> 00:30:06,928
Yes, he is.

684
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:09,097
He's just smarter.

685
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:10,632
<i>give him some time.
i'm sure--</i>

686
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,100
He hates me.

687
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:13,702
<i>his body is going
through withdrawal.</i>

688
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:15,036
He's adjusting.

689
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:16,971
<i>maybe he never loved me.
not really.</i>

690
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,842
Maybe we never really
had anything at all.

691
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,811
<i>(sidas)
somebody help!</i>

692
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:31,886
I can't feel my legs.
i can't feel my legs.

693
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,757
Anywhere.

694
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:39,094
Nothing.

695
00:30:42,698 --> 00:30:45,233
We have to talk
about this.

696
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:47,802
It's late. i'm tired.

697

874
00:40:18,727 --> 00:40:20,127
It's okay.

875
00:40:20,195 --> 00:40:22,697
Does your kid
like animals?

876
00:40:22,764 --> 00:40:25,199
I got tickets to
that holiday carnival.

877
00:40:25,267 --> 00:40:27,635
I hear they have
a nice petting zoo.

878
00:40:27,703 --> 00:40:30,538
I think i was
pretty clear before.

879
00:40:30,605 --> 00:40:33,107
I don't mean with me.

880
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:36,711
Here. take 'em. enjoy.

881
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:40,247
No, thanks.

882
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:43,050
They're not fake.
i didn't steal them.

883
00:40:43,118 --> 00:40:46,787
One of the nurses was selling
'em for her kid's scout trip.

884
00:40:46,855 --> 00:40:48,656
I know it doesn't make
things right between us,

885
00:40:48,724 --> 00:40:53,828
But i just wanted
to do something nice.

886
00:40:53,895 --> 00:40:58,265
I don't want them.

887
00:40:58,333 --> 00:40:59,967
Okay.

888
00:41:00,035 --> 00:41:02,903
I'll see you tomorrow.

889
00:41:13,482 --> 00:41:15,316
They didn't split up.

890
00:41:15,383 --> 00:41:16,817
She wouldn't
take the tickets.

891
00:41:16,885 --> 00:41:19,253
Of course.

892
00:41:19,321 --> 00:41:22,022
Windtalker code for
"we never split up."

893
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,824
House, she told you
multiple times

894
00:41:23,892 --> 00:41:25,359
She wants nothing
to do with you.

895
00:41:25,427 --> 00:41:27,361
I wasn't gonna be there.

896
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:30,064
She just felt guilty
that i felt guilty,

897
00:41:30,132 --> 00:41:32,233
<i>so she couldn't
take them.</i>

898
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,335
Either that or she didn't
want to appease you.

899
00:41:34,402 --> 00:41:36,504
These weren't
reparations.

900
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:38,572
Just a simple
gesture of remorse,

901
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,441
And she slapped it down.

902
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:44,211
They didn't break up.

903
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:49,049
She just wanted me
to think that so i'd back off.

904
00:41:49,117 --> 00:41:53,487
Dare i ask
what you're gonna do?

905
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:55,756
Nothing.

906
00:41:55,824 --> 00:41:58,259
I said they'd either break up
or they'd stay together.

907
00:41:58,326 --> 00:42:01,395
They didn't break up.

908
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:04,231
And you're
okay with that?

909
00:42:04,299 --> 00:42:07,802
It is what it is.

910
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:11,705
Good for you.

911
00:42:11,773 --> 00:42:15,342
Aah.

912
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,379

913
00:42:18,446 --> 00:42:19,747
¶ ¶

914
00:42:19,815 --> 00:42:20,881
House knows i lied.

915
00:42:20,949 --> 00:42:23,918
Why? what'd he say?

916
00:42:23,985 --> 00:42:25,820
Nothing.
i could just tell.

917
00:42:25,887 --> 00:42:27,454
You want to stage
another breakup?

918
00:42:27,522 --> 00:42:29,056
No.

919
00:42:29,124 --> 00:42:31,926
Oh, hi.

920
00:42:31,993 --> 00:42:34,595
It seems like he's
gonna leave us alone.

921
00:42:34,663 --> 00:42:37,398
Why would he do that?

922
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:39,797
I'm not completely sure.

923
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:44,798
So, we have his blessing?

924
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:46,799
I guess so.

925
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,800
Maybe House isn't so bad after all.

926
00:42:58,101 --> 00:42:59,801
That would be nice, wouldn't it?

927
00:42:59,802 --> 00:43:06,802
