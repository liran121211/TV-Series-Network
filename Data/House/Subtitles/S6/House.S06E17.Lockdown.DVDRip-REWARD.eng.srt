1
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,352
How about
the name Brooke?

2
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:30,793
She just doesn't
seem like a Brooke anymore.

3
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:32,525
Brooklyn?

4
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,157
She's a baby,
not a city.

5
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,804
What do you think, bud?
Got any suggestions?

6
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,137
Toadette.
I'm hungry.

7
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:44,776
I'll get you guys
something to eat.

8
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,036
You're okay.

9
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,545
Okay.

10
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,427
I was paged?

11
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:13,327
What are you
doing here?

12
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,843
Can we talk
somewhere?

13
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,674
I was thinking...

14
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,355
Sarah?

15
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,457
Yeah.

16
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:42,626
Where's the baby?

17
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,803
No one saw
anyone go in or out,

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,404
and the baby's
not in the nursery.

19
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,211
What was her condition?
Five weeks pre-term.

20
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,978
C- section because
of mom's preeclampsia.

21
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,246
Is that the father?

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,915
Mr. Lozinski, I'm Dr. Lisa
Cuddy, Dean of Medicine.

23
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,685
How long were you
out of the room?

24
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,086
Fifteen,
20 minutes, tops.

25
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:10,254
Was there
a proximity alarm?

26
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,388
No alarms.

27
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,590
What's that?

28
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:16,499
The bracelet on your baby's ankle has
a microchip that would set off alarms

29
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,195
if she were carried
through an exit.

30
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,229
Call the police, shut down all
the exits. We're on lockdown.

31
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,004
Nobody moves until
we find that baby.

32
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,208
Why won't you
sign the divorce papers?

33
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,546
It's been on my
to-do list, sorry.

34
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,454
Will you sign them?

35
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,789
Not until we have a real
conversation about our marriage.

36
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,392
Okay, I made a mistake
coming here. I'm sorry.

37
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,226
I'm gonna leave
this copy here.

38
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,636
<i>Code Seven. Code Seven.</i>

39
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,804
<i>All non-essential
personnel and guests,</i>

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,041
<i>please remain
where you are.</i>

41
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,810
<i>Security personnel should

42
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,115
<i>and await
further instructions.</i>

43
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,678
<i>All patients, please
remain in your rooms</i>

44
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,725
<i>and use call buttons if
you need medical assistance.</i>

45
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:50,592
<i>Please remain calm and wait for
hospital personnel to come to you.</i>

46
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:54,098
<i>Do not try to leave your
room until the Code Seven...</i>

47
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:56,158
It's clear all the way
down. Nurse, just leave it.

48
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,328
But it's...
Leave it.

49
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,529
You need to get
into the room now.

50
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:00,732
<i>Please notify hospital
personnel or police immediately</i>

51
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,536
<i>if you see anything
suspicious.</i>

52
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,443
<i>We cannot allow anyone to
leave the hospital at this time.</i>

53
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:09,242
<i>All personnel should remain
in their staging areas</i>

54
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,714
<i>unless otherwise
instructed by security.</i>

55
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,615
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Gotta clear the...

56
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,381
<i>Thank you for your
patience and cooperation.</i>

57
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,590
And did anyone other than your nurses
ever come by asking about your daughter?

58
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,861
No. No,
just those two.

59
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:32,396
I'll check in soon.

60
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,598
Wait. Hon, what are you doing?

61
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,105
No, I need
to help them look.

62
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,664
You have
to stay in bed.

63
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:38,973
You pulled a stitch,
lay back down.

64
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,102
I've got it.

65
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:41,703
Why don't I give you
something to help you relax?

66
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,614
No, no. I don't want to
relax. I want to find my baby.

67
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,309
The police are searching room by room.

68
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,649
Who would take her? What
if she needs to be fed?

69
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,915
We're gonna find her.

70
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,890
Why aren't the police
talking to our nurse?

71
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,755
What now?
Truth or Dare?

72
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:01,891
Oh, no, you don't
want to mess with me.

73
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,765
Truth or Dare queen
at Newton North.

74
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,133
I was kidding.

75
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:06,933
I'm sure we can find something
interesting to talk about

76
00:05:07,006 --> 00:05:09,133
without relying on some juvenile game.

77
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,266
Sure.

78
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:19,979
Truth.

79
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,618
They think I took the kid? Do
you think I would do something...

80
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,318
I'm just asking questions.

81
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:30,390
The dad let the older brother
hold the baby for the first time,

82
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,399
so I put her in his lap. After
a few seconds, she shrieked.

83
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:35,866
I'm pretty sure
he pinched her.

84
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,132
I need to know this stuff,
anything out of the ordinary.

85
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:42,333
It was sibling rivalry. I
thought it was kind of ordinary.

86
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,108
Hey.

87
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,442
What are you
doing down here?

88
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,315
I was looking for
McKenna's patient file.

89
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,648
Oh. You mean this file?

90
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,481
The one I said I'd get?
Two hours ago.

91
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:00,856
Seriously,
you don't trust me

92
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:03,327
with the immense responsibility
of fetching a file?

93
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,489
If you already found it, what
are you looking through those for?

94
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,863
Do you know
what these are?

95
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,633
The staff credentials files.

96
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,932
Those should
all be in HR.

97
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,233
Down here
to be digitized.

98
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,707
And we're locked in, and whoever's
supposed to be watching them is locked out.

99
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,404
We could look up
anything on anyone.

100
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,313
Malpractice records,
felony histories...

101
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,873
Put them away.
Come on.

102
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:29,387
We have a tiny window of opportunity to
gain some insight into our colleagues.

103
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,385
Okay. What if we just snoop on our boss?

104
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,156
I think I can
live with that.

105
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:56,181
You're on two milligrams
of morphine an hour.

106
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,080
How the hell are
you still awake?

107
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:00,674
No, don't tell me.

108
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,919
Ischemic cardiomyopathy.

109
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,784
If the blood's not
reaching your gut,

110
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,227
you'd have intestinal
hypoperfusion,

111
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,527
that'd be stronger
than the narcotics.

112
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,898
The nurse said I might
only have a day or two left.

113
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,664
She was being kind.

114
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:29,946
You're Dr. House,
aren't you?

115
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,775
Oh, God, don't tell me we used to date.

116
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:38,118
The limp, yeah, I read about
you. I sent you a letter.

117
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,089
Before they knew
what was wrong,

118
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,253
I tried to get you
to take my case.

119
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,597
Yeah, well, you should
have kept reading.

120
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:48,225
Heart disease is kind
of below my pay grade.

121
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,899
It started
as tooth pain.

122
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:55,135
No one got it that
it was a heart problem

123
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:58,972
until I had a series
of massive heart attacks.

124
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,218
This doesn't bother you?

125
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,091
You talking with your
mouth full? A little.

126
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,530
I meant the fact that you're
standing in here watching me die

127
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,398
because my file bored you.

128
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,268
I take maybe
one in 20 cases.

129
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:30,136
A lot of the people
I turn down end up dying.

130
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:34,208
It's really a good argument for
there being more than one me,

131
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,213
when you think about it.

132
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:46,716
Truth.

133
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:47,884
All right.

134
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,656
Have you ever
had a threesome?

135
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,924
No.

136
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,523
You haven't?

137
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,567
What, just because
I'm bisexual?

138
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,603
Well, yeah.

139
00:08:58,104 --> 00:08:59,731
Do you understand
what bisexual means?

140
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:01,864
It doesn't mean you have
sex with two people at once.

141
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,566
And by the way, you didn't
ask me if I'd had a foursome.

142
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:05,770
Truth or dare?

143
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,278
Wait, you've had a foursome? No.

144
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,610
But now you've asked me two
questions so I get to ask you two.

145
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,445
You see why I was the queen.

146
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,819
Walker wouldn't do anything,
he's my son, too.

147
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,056
I don't mean to sound cold,
but he's your stepson.

148
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:29,000
We can't ignore
any possibility.

149
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,941
Walker's been getting in
fights a lot at school, lately.

150
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:42,381
Last week, he hit another kid with
a book, hard enough to draw blood.

151
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,011
If he did something
to the baby...

152
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:06,632
We were working on it.

153
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,232
We failed.

154
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,503
No. You had a conversation with House,

155
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:14,671
then came back, informed me
I'd been forever poisoned by him

156
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,078
and started packing.

157
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,979
It's interesting how your
story leaves out the part

158
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,984
where you murdered
another human being.

159
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,179
A dictator who was
committing genocide.

160
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,881
You thought about
doing it yourself.

161
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,048
But I didn't.

162
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,888
Right, because you're
not toxic like I am.

163
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,459
What do you think
is gonna happen here?

164
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,555
You're going to logic
me into coming back?

165
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,839
There must be over 30
malpractice settlements in here.

166
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,935
He did a brain biopsy
without CT mapping

167
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:47,741
"causing brain herniation
and death. "

168
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,014
Look at this one.

169
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:55,247
"Patient lost four liters of
blood from a botched penisectomy. "

170
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,184
On a patient
named Lisa Cuddy?

171
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:03,255
Damn it, they're all named Lisa Cuddy!

172
00:11:03,362 --> 00:11:05,626
He's not even here and
he's screwing with us.

173
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,790
Where's the joy
in that?

174
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,395
You really wanna
get into his head?

175
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,566
Yeah, but I decided against
stabbing myself in the leg

176
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,269
or getting addicted
to pain pills.

177
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,107
You can skip
the stabbing.

178
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,308
Where did you...
Confiscated them

179
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:29,650
from a drug seeker in the clinic.
Didn't get a chance to turn them in.

180
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,550
It is after-hours.

181
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:35,624
I'll take one.

182
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,662
Walk in House's
shoes for a night.

183
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:42,256
One? I believe
he wears a larger size.

184
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:56,510
No cards, no flowers,
not even a phone call.

185
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:58,613
Let me guess,
lighthouse keeper?

186
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:02,245
I was a classics professor
at Princeton for 26 years.

187
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:03,982
Mostly research.

188
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:08,424
So, your closest colleagues died
2,000 years ago, that must be it.

189
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:14,291
Not that you have no friends because,
say, you're a miserable bastard.

190
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,501
What do you care?

191
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,702
The next few hours
are gonna be grim.

192
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:24,471
There'll be nausea, pain, no company
as soon as I get myself out of here.

193
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:30,372
I can unlock the regulator, you can
put yourself into a narcotic haze,

194
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,713
sleep blissfully
to the end.

195
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,878
Is that a favor
to me or to you?

196
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,345
Win-win.

197
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,825
No, thanks.

198
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,086
You're trying to guilt me
for not taking your case?

199
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,757
You think a classicist
doesn't believe in fate?

200
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:51,701
You think Odysseus would lie whimpering
like a loser in a hospital bed?

201
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:54,696
Come on,
take my offer.

202
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,734
Take the drug holiday,
numb yourself out.

203
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,175
I think you're the one
who wants to numb himself out.

204
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,559
Truth.

205
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,991
How did your dad react
when you came out to him?

206
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,661
He made me tea.

207
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:29,639
Seriously. Doesn't matter what I tell
him, he smiles, tells me he supports me,

208
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,767
and makes me some
peppermint tea.

209
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:32,902
Truth or dare?

210
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,172
Truth.

211
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,971
Are you dating anyone?

212
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:38,243
Now? No.

213
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,312
Interesting, you added
a modifier. Truth.

214
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,088
When you were dating
Foreman... No, no, no.

215
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,353
What?

216
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,951
If it was something
personal about him or us,

217
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,294
I just don't think that's right
to answer. We all work together.

218
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,526
That's the whole point of
this game, something personal,

219
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,295
preferably embarrassing.
Just pick something else.

220
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,768
You see,
this is your problem.

221
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,829
You act like you're
so liberal and open,

222
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,964
but you are the least...

223
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,305
I changed my mind.
Dare. Just no nudity.

224
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:09,040
Yes, nudity. I want
you to show your breasts

225
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,647
to Taub.

226
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,650
That is the most
idiotic dare ever.

227
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,484
Have you ever
played this game?

228
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,451
Well, I thought showing me your
breasts would be a little exploitative.

229
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,961
Your dare is in
the future, genius.

230
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,257
Hey, if you're saying
you won't do it...

231
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,389
No, no, no, no.

232
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,559
Of course I'll show my breasts to Taub,

233
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,569
tomorrow, perhaps, or
maybe sometime next year,

234
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:35,333
you know, because
I'm honor-bound.

235
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:36,499
Truth or dare?

236
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:44,214
It's understandable that you
wouldn't be happy right now.

237
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,581
Your world is changing.
Are you scared?

238
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,252
And how do you feel
about your sister?

239
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,991
I hate her.

240
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,899
Walker, this is important. Did
you do anything to the baby?

241
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,335
Did you move her somewhere? Hide her?

242
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,429
No.

243
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:08,632
Nobody'll be mad at you.

244
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:11,232
I said no,
so stop asking me.

245
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,345
Bad pain day?

246
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:22,277
Bad pain month.

247
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,879
And since
I'm not using it...

248
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,221
If you don't
want the morphine,

249
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:30,888
you must have
something of your own.

250
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,794
I was in rehab.

251
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,299
Had a little problem with
the "something of my own. "

252
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,097
Now all I take is ibuprofen,
and that's two flights up.

253
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:39,397
For the whole month?

254
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:43,100
The pain's migrated, I think
the arterial wall is damaged.

255
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,641
And what?
You don't know?

256
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,974
I haven't had
an arteriogram yet.

257
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:51,774
You don't want the test in
case the arterial wall is fine,

258
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:56,048
which would mean that the pain
is coming from something else.

259
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,251
What's her name?

260
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,961
Interesting that you'd jump from
physical pain to long-lost love.

261
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,494
You're projecting.

262
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,863
So, what's her name?

263
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,568
What time is it?

264
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,668
What does it matter to you?
It's T-minus four hours.

265
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:26,610
8:20. Now tell me
who she is,

266
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:31,019
and what are the pathetically long
odds that she's gonna visit or call.

267
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,387
Only that's a reason
not to take the morphine.

268
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:44,862
Dude.

269
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,096
Dude.

270
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,169
Is the room
still spinning?

271
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,777
Mine is.

272
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:57,546
Maybe we shouldn't
have taken so many?

273
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,578
I'm gonna try
to stand up.

274
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:05,316
You be careful.

275
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,225
Oh, yeah,
that's working.

276
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,298
I can't feel my face.

277
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,007
No way.

278
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,669
Way. Hit me.

279
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,276
What?

280
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,247
Hit me in the face.

281
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,545
Seriously?

282
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,418
You know you've always
wanted to. Now's your chance.

283
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:41,823
That's a great idea. We can
start a fight club, maybe we...

284
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:48,157
Oh, my God, you're
right. That is so cool.

285
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,723
Okay, I'll even...

286
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,896
I can still feel my hand.

287
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,072
I wasn't ready.

288
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:00,612
What were you gonna do,
flex your goatee muscle?

289
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,407
Wait a minute.

290
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:08,213
This is your
credentials file?

291
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,845
Give me that.

292
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:16,087
That's why you came down
here, not for the patient file.

293
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,198
You wanted...
You wanted...

294
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,874
Okay, Robert. I will answer
whatever questions you want.

295
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:36,174
But then you're gonna
have to sign the papers.

296
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,707
Did you ever love me?

297
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,046
How can you
even ask that?

298
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,749
The first time you slept with me
was because you were on crystal meth.

299
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:47,382
I was on the drugs
because I was emotional.

300
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,518
It was the emotions that led
to the sex, not the drugs.

301
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,926
Not true.

302
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,022
After that, you refused to let
it go further than just sex.

303
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,260
Because I knew I was falling
for you and I didn't want to.

304
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,858
And that never changed.

305
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,370
You broke off our vacation
because I bought you a ring.

306
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,066
I got cold feet,
I'm not proud of it.

307
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,574
And then you almost
called off our wedding

308
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,439
because you couldn't
give up the idea... No.

309
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:06,909
Don't. ... of having
your dead husband's baby.

310
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,571
Don't bring him up.
Because even then

311
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,171
you weren't
sure about me.

312
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,682
Maybe if I was dying
when you married me,

313
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,842
it would've been
a bit different.

314
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,907
That's not fair.

315
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,681
It's not only fair,
it's exactly the point.

316
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:19,451
He was dying when you met him and he
was gone just a year into the marriage.

317
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,048
So, it was all
a honeymoon with him,

318
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:22,957
and I could never
match up to that.

319
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,120
The first time reality
intruded on... Stop this.

320
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,221
Just tell me the truth.
About what?

321
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,357
Did you ever love me?

322
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,957
I don't know!

323
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:40,567
Thank you for finally
telling me.

324
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,589
Truth.

325
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,288
You said you weren't
dating anyone now.

326
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,732
Does that mean you recently
were or soon will be?

327
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,967
Oh. Look who's
guarded now.

328
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:12,407
You had no problem talking about
your sex life, but your love life...

329
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,473
Fine, dare it is.

330
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,276
No nudity.
Now or in the future.

331
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,655
You're too much of
a nice boy, Wilson.

332
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,086
Let's let the bad boy
out for a bit.

333
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:36,624
You have to go steal
one dollar, right now.

334
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:38,735
From who?

335
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:45,974
Oh, come on.

336
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,342
"Interned at Hopkins,"
old news.

337
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:53,577
Here we go!
"Academic probation. "

338
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:56,678
I'm asking you
to please stop reading.

339
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,581
I'm afraid
I can't do that.

340
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:02,684
"Faked a lab result. "
Very wrong.

341
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,831
And you came down to destroy the
record before it gets digitized.

342
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,694
Permanentized.
Even wronger.

343
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:12,831
I...

344
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:18,436
I needed to beat all those
elite, spoiled kids around me.

345
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:23,547
To show no weakness,
to win at everything.

346
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,410
Why'd I just
tell you that?

347
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,681
I always talk too much
when I'm stoned.

348
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,112
Why'd I just tell you that?

349
00:21:37,663 --> 00:21:39,528
It was stupid.

350
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,828
You had great grades. One lab
result shouldn't have mattered.

351
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,595
Except I didn't
think I deserved

352
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,797
to be at a top med school
in the first place.

353
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,133
Again.

354
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,398
Faking a lab result
is one thing,

355
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:54,172
but you needing to come down
here to destroy the records

356
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,372
12 years after the fact...

357
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,048
This isn't about
med school.

358
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:05,821
You don't think you belong
here at the hospital.

359
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:13,721
"Dr. Taub, comma,
Christopher Michael. "

360
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:22,166
So, this is what it comes
down to in the final hours.

361
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,839
Deifying some lost love.

362
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,346
Hoping to get her on the phone
and make everything perfect.

363
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,778
It's pathetic.

364
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,306
Either you left her for a reason
or she left you for a reason.

365
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,743
A phone call
is not gonna...

366
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,913
It's my daughter.

367
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,888
So, why isn't she here?

368
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:46,992
I left my family
when Gracie was six.

369
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:51,397
I was sort of
forced out, actually,

370
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,529
after I had had an affair
with a student.

371
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,299
For sex or love?

372
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:59,742
Neither.

373
00:23:01,613 --> 00:23:05,208
I'd only married Gracie's
mother because of the baby.

374
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,046
But I didn't think I could
handle the commitment,

375
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:13,581
and just like any decent
academic, I proved myself right.

376
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:17,628
And what time it is
matters because...

377
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,095
She's a dance
teacher in Atlanta,

378
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,065
she gets home
from work at 9:00,

379
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:25,194
and I just wanted to
speak to her one more time.

380
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,228
That's my story.

381
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:30,969
What's yours?

382
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,344
Same thing,
pretty much.

383
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:39,776
I'm gonna be dead
in a few hours,

384
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,978
your secrets
couldn't be safer,

385
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,989
unless you're keeping
them from yourself.

386
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,226
I like being alone.

387
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,830
At least I convinced myself
that I'm better off that way.

388
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:04,874
And then I met someone in a
psychiatric hospital of all places.

389
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:07,938
She changed me.

390
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,978
And then she left.

391
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:19,847
We're better off alone. We
suffer alone, we die alone.

392
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:24,156
Doesn't matter if you're a model
husband or father of the year,

393
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,461
tomorrow will be
the same for you.

394
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,201
But yesterday
would've been different.

395
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,135
Hey, Daria.

396
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,306
Dr. Wilson.

397
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,378
Could you cook me up
a chicken sandwich?

398
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:48,817
Grill's closed.

399
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:50,286
It's important, medically.

400
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,813
Dr. Hadley needs a
high-protein meal right now.

401
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,692
She doesn't like to talk about
it but she has hypoproteinemia.

402
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,320
We got chicken salad.

403
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:01,024
Yeah, that's cold.

404
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,761
She needs to eat warm
protein for this disease?

405
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,700
Well, we could
give her cold protein

406
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,931
whose uptake enzymes
haven't been activated,

407
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,907
as long as you don't mind her risking
liver and kidney failure and eventual death.

408
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,844
But, hey, it's worth it so you
don't have to flip on the grill.

409
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,849
You don't have to be
obnoxious about it.

410
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,563
How do you look so okay?

411
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,399
I spent months wondering
how I made it go bad.

412
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:19,439
If you never loved me, then
I didn't do anything wrong.

413
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,906
Hey.

414
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:26,116
Allison, come on.

415
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,014
It's all right.

416
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,986
Still don't know
why I said that.

417
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:37,327
It's not even true.
I did love you.

418
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:45,667
Just not in a way that
would have ever worked.

419
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,494
Why not?

420
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:52,202
Because everything
you said is true.

421
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,345
I'm a mess.

422
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,346
I married a man
I knew was dying,

423
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,888
so God knows how
screwed up I already was.

424
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,823
Him dying messed
me up even more.

425
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,459
I pushed you
out of my life.

426
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:19,167
And I'm unfixable.

427
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:24,598
Not you.

428
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,746
I'm sorry.

429
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,182
I'm sorry, too.

430
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:12,045
Truth.

431
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,351
Shut up.

432
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:14,914
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,085
It's not your fault.

434
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,059
No, I didn't
even play fair.

435
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,391
You asked me how my dad reacted
when I told him I was bisexual.

436
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,128
And the Huntington's.

437
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:25,224
No tea party?

438
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:26,531
I never told him.

439
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:28,037
He's been through enough.

440
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,376
So, he just visits his
heterosexual, healthy daughter,

441
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,072
and you go out to dinner and a
movie and talk about your garden?

442
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:37,614
I work late. He's staying at my house.

443
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,708
It's easier if I stay
elsewhere as much as I can.

444
00:28:40,785 --> 00:28:43,549
You can't suppress your life
for his convenience.

445
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,885
You don't see
a little irony in that?

446
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,788
That's exactly what
you do for House.

447
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,793
When he moved in with you, you
bought a bigger place for him.

448
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,829
No wonder you're
not dating anyone.

449
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,631
You're right.

450
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,601
That woman, the woman
I'm not involved with,

451
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:06,474
her name is Sam Carr. But in
1990 and 1991, it was Sam Wilson.

452
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:08,806
Your ex-wife?

453
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,713
No, my mother.
Yes, my ex-wife.

454
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:15,344
Ex number one. She
friended me a few weeks ago.

455
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:18,616
We started e-mailing, turns
out she's recently divorced,

456
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,056
and I wanted
to ask her out.

457
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,889
You can't take
a woman to dinner

458
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:28,159
or else House will go running
straight back to the loony bin?

459
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:30,497
You're not worried about House,
you're worried about yourself

460
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:31,865
because she's an ex,

461
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,133
so even dinner will mean
it's immediately serious.

462
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:41,244
What are your favorite
parts that you remember?

463
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,748
I liked how, when I'd wake
up in the middle of the night,

464
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,822
you'd put your arm around me
and you wouldn't even wake up.

465
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:57,753
I liked watching you stand up to your dad
at Christmas when he yelled at your mom.

466
00:29:57,862 --> 00:30:02,356
How you didn't even know you
were strong, but you were.

467
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:06,735
What do you miss?

468
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,067
I miss a lot.

469
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,374
But when I think
about missing you,

470
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:17,403
I think about that dance class
that we took, for our wedding.

471
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,049
It's weird.

472
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:28,256
I think, "He's never going
to hold me like that again. "

473
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:55,977
Oh, God.

474
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,316
Come on.

475
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,331
I'm gonna miss this, too.

476
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,011
<i>"Published in The New
England Journal at 26"?</i>

477
00:31:22,113 --> 00:31:24,775
I finished all the lab
work a year earlier.

478
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:29,645
"Led a group of surgeons to fix
cleft palates in Bangladesh"?

479
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:33,246
What can I say? That concert
was very moving to me.

480
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,791
I have to take a knee.

481
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:39,125
I don't get it. This has gotta be
the most spectacular file down here.

482
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,791
Why are you pretending
to be ashamed?

483
00:31:41,866 --> 00:31:44,858
I'd trade mine for
yours in a second.

484
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:48,427
When I was in med school, I
thought I'd be House someday.

485
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:53,735
Instead, I'm a fellow,
working with...

486
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:59,080
Working for people
years younger than me.

487
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:03,844
So, we both have
a few regrets.

488
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:09,389
You should be proud of yours.
Your life's been trending up.

489
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,428
No news.

490
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:20,167
How you holding up?

491
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,834
You let them sedate you.

492
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,034
Yeah.

493
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,304
Do you have kids?

494
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:28,606
A little girl.

495
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,905
I adopted her last year.

496
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:35,611
I adopted Walker right after
Donald and I got married.

497
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:42,783
What if I can never love Walker
the way I love my daughter?

498
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,563
Does that make me
a horrible person?

499
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,095
Let me get you
some tissues.

500
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,806
Did you request
some extra towels?

501
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:09,318
No. What? Why?

502
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,786
There are eight towels
in Sarah's room.

503
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,054
Okay.

504
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:18,561
There should only be four.

505
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,790
Housekeeping handles towels.

506
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,263
I need you to track
down their logs.

507
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,925
Figure out who was
up there and when.

508
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,195
Because they
got extra towels?

509
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,794
Just find the logs. Now.

510
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,241
Adrienne, you okay?

511
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,905
Sure.

512
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,940
What's wrong?

513
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:43,583
Adrienne,
give me your arm.

514
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,124
The hair on her left arm
is standing up.

515
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,717
Asymmetric
neurological function.

516
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,490
She's having
a pilomotor seizure.

517
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:53,894
She seemed fine
a minute ago.

518
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,958
She was, she's probably been
having complex seizures all day.

519
00:33:58,069 --> 00:33:59,468
She'd be basically
functional,

520
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,437
but more or less
acting on autopilot.

521
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,407
She probably dropped
the towels off twice.

522
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,344
She could have
taken the baby.

523
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,344
We never really did
have a proper goodbye.

524
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,320
It's 9:00.

525
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:47,040
<i>It's Gracie, I can't come to the
phone, so please leave a message.</i>

526
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,018
I guess she's running late.

527
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,023
You don't seem
that surprised.

528
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,196
That's what you
expected to get.

529
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,532
You waited until
you knew she'd be out.

530
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:18,908
Her aunt said that
she starts work late.

531
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:25,045
Every now and then, I just call
to hear her voice on the machine.

532
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,552
I was never there
when she needed me.

533
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,459
What right do I have
to need her now?

534
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,789
None.

535
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:43,094
Which just means you're a
hypocrite. Because apparently you do.

536
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:53,138
Forget about rights. Just tell
her what you need to tell her.

537
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:00,316
<i>It's Gracie, I can't come to the
phone, so please leave a message.</i>

538
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,585
Gracie?

539
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,059
This is

540
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,662
your father.

541
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,264
I love you.

542
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,699
Anything?

543
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,830
We've covered every room
on Maldonado's logs.

544
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:53,426
Been everywhere she's been.

545
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:02,270
Where's the other cart? Isn't
there usually another cart in here?

546
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,761
Hey.

547
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,134
Okay. Okay.

548
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,538
Okay.

549
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,110
Hi.

550
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,926
Anyone in there?
Lockdown's over.

551
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,628
I should go.

552
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,271
Yeah.

553
00:39:44,448 --> 00:39:46,348
I just asked
Sam to dinner.

554
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:49,047
Little baby's
all growed-up.

555
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,117
You gonna
tell your dad?

556
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,590
I'll stop by his hotel,
talk to him.

557
00:39:56,861 --> 00:40:00,194
Hotel? You said he was
staying at your apartment.

558
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:06,469
Was there any truth
in anything you said?

559
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:10,530
The part about it being a good idea
for you to call Sam. That was true.

560
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,871
Good night, Remy.
Good night, James.

561
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,672
<i>Code Seven has
been lifted.</i>

562
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,269
<i>Repeat. Code Seven
has been lifted.</i>

563
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,042
You want your file?

564
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,812
Nah.

565
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:22,910
<i>All hospital personnel</i>

566
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:24,648
<i>can leave their staging
areas... Good for you.</i>

567
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,916
<i>...and report back
to their department.</i>

568
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,322
<i>Thank you for
your cooperation.</i>

569
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,257
We don't have to tell anybody what we...

570
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:31,316
Mmm-mmm.

571
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:35,422
You got the patient file?

572
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,557
I'll grab it.

573
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,797
Thanks.
See you tomorrow.

574
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,935
I think I'm ready to
take you up on your offer.

575
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:43,661
Dr. House? Lockdown
ended a few minutes ago.

576
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,892
Yeah, I know.

577
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:58,506
I'm sorry I didn't
take your case.

578
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:05,585
Me, too.

579
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:18,130
Gracie was the cutest
six-year-old you ever saw.

580
00:42:53,671 --> 00:42:55,764
Interesting night, huh?

581
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,907
Interesting night.
