1
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,856
I guess
everybody else is dead.

2
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,252
Which means we're
totally outnumbered.

3
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,163
We gotta make up for
that in pure firepower.

4
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:35,326
You want to raid the
feeding area, don't you?

5
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,869
Two boxes of
grenades in there.

6
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:39,404
It's our only chance
at getting out.

7
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,536
Vince, that place
is a deathtrap.

8
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,440
Lucky for you I've
got the megablaster.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,074
Lee, you go right, Roy,
straight down the middle.

10
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,050
I'll cover you both.

11
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,183
One, two, three.

12
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,992
Where's that
cover fire?

13
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,935
Megablaster, dude,
megablaster!

14
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:19,702
What the hell?

15
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,577
Got it.
Vince, where are you?

16
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,946
I can't
get them off of me.

17
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,456
Vince, you d-bag,
where are you?

18
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:35,153
Damn it! Damn it!

19
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,419
Damn it, Vince.

20
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,690
That blood look
funny to you?

21
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,293
Still working on it.
The code's a little janky.

22
00:01:44,838 --> 00:01:48,069
Hey, boss, you just like watching
us get our asses shredded?

23
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,438
Yeah, not that
you're not hilarious,

24
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,637
but we hit the shelves
in three months.

25
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,946
Vince?

26
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,915
Vince, what's wrong?

27
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:04,656
My hands,
they're on fire.

28
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,988
Your NCV test was normal.
Rules out carpal tunnel.

29
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,762
No evidence of trauma,
your blood work looks normal.

30
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,827
Then what is it?
I don't know.

31
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,532
I'll arrange to have you
transferred to a neurologist.

32
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,370
A neurologist? Don't you have
some famous diagnostics guy?

33
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:57,500
What's he doing?

34
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,808
I quit.

35
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,086
You can't quit.

36
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,123
I think you're confusing me
with Jake Gyllenhaal.

37
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,180
House, are you okay?

38
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,954
Yeah. And I want
to stay that way.

39
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,290
I talked it over
with my therapist.

40
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,387
I need to change my
environment, my habits.

41
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,364
But he cleared you to
get your license back.

42
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,027
Which will help immensely
with my new job in research.

43
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:26,731
I've sent out some resumes. Research
means no patients, less pressure.

44
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,264
But you just got out, have you had
enough time to think this through?

45
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,877
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,449
I know this will
affect both of you,

47
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,544
and Thirteen,
and the one with the nose.

48
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:46,819
But I just can't
risk coming back here.

49
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,227
Okay.

50
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,273
That was surprising.

51
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,547
I want to run
the department.

52
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,511
You consider waiting
until House clears the lobby

53
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,284
before you start angling
for his job?

54
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,882
He's not dead
or sentimental,

55
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,221
and somebody
needs to do it.

56
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,955
Not necessarily.

57
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,493
Departments of diagnostic
medicine don't exist.

58
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,193
The only reason we have one
is because of House.

59
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,499
You reassigned us, kept us
on payroll for three months,

60
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,765
you might as well
give me a chance.

61
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,965
You're a great doctor,

62
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,443
I want you to stay on in
Neuro, but House was a genius.

63
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:42,140
House was an egotistical,
pill-popping, lawsuit magnet.

64
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,510
And a genius.

65
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:48,680
And I worked with him longer
than anybody else. I can do this.

66
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,556
You get one shot.

67
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,025
What's House gonna do?

68
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,830
No idea,
but he's gone,

69
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,098
so how about we focus
on the medicine?

70
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:08,471
What?

71
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,406
You're the boss,
it's kind of sexy.

72
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,811
Here I thought
it was just the pants.

73
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,335
Diabetic neuropathy?

74
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,609
HbA1c looks fine.

75
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,184
Could be hypothyroidism.

76
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,083
No fatigue
or weight gain.

77
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,985
What about complex
regional pain syndrome?

78
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,819
That's a good idea.
Let's run with it.

79
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,950
Look at that. No House,
the job still gets done.

80
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:28,186
And yet,
something's missing.

81
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,923
I'm short, he's black,
you're gay-ish.

82
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,089
That's it.

83
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,657
Treat for CRPS. Prep the
patient for spinal stimulation.

84
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,396
I don't buy it.

85
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,906
CRPS isn't that
well understood, but...

86
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,772
I think it's mercury
poisoning. I eat a ton of sushi.

87
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,209
And you're currently
getting mixed reviews

88
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,874
<i>in Speed the Plow on
Broadway? Google it.</i>

89
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,211
It's pretty hard to
consume enough fish

90
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,649
to give yourself
mercury poisoning,

91
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,778
and it doesn't usually
present solely with pain.

92
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,914
<i>But it can. Check out the
Atlantic Medical Journal.</i>

93
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,514
This guy came in
with burning pain

94
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:02,993
caused by
Erythromelalgia

95
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,188
caused by
mercury poisoning.

96
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,890
Who needs actual doctors
when you've got the Internet?

97
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,626
No offense,
but doctors make mistakes.

98
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,463
Medical errors are
up 30% this year.

99
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,366
You should check
the rate of patient error.

100
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,369
There's a ton of
information out there.

101
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,000
Why wouldn't I educate
myself, be my own advocate?

102
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,634
CRPS came up in
my search, too,

103
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,372
but I've never had
any skin discoloration,

104
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,573
and my pain is sporadic,
not constant.

105
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,683
It's gotta be worth
one lousy blood test.

106
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,180
You know how
House feels

107
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,587
about people
touching his ball.

108
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,249
No, Chase refuses
to tell me.

109
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,157
Right, my husband's gay.
Witty.

110
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,821
I hear you're
taking over for House.

111
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,895
You're gonna be great.
Congratulations.

112
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:16,624
Not permanent.

113
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,569
Yet. Taub and Thirteen
cool with it?

114
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,766
He's older than you.
She's seen you naked.

115
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,002
Not like we haven't been working
together for two years now.

116
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,136
Working with is different
than working for.

117
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,881
You saw House,
how was he?

118
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,942
He was good.

119
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,649
He was honest, took responsibility.
It was kind of weird.

120
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:42,620
Is Thirteen around? I need her
to sign off on her ER transfer.

121
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,220
She and Taub are doing
a spinal stimulation.

122
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,424
No, they're not.

123
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,831
I just dropped a patient
in the cath suite,

124
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,392
and your guys
were not in there.

125
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,667
You know, usually,
spinal stimulation

126
00:07:57,743 --> 00:07:59,267
is done with the patient
in the room.

127
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,404
He asked us to test
his blood for mercury.

128
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,244
It's unlikely,
but not impossible.

129
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,578
It's also not
what we agreed on.

130
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,379
Testing doesn't hurt, and
it only takes 20 minutes.

131
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:07,510
I figured
it didn't matter.

132
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:10,147
I'm thinking I should
decide when it matters.

133
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,021
If you're done
marking your territory...

134
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:17,859
Test results. Surprise,
surprise, Marcus Webly was wrong.

135
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,560
I'll handle this.

136
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,936
You expected not to
have mixed feelings?

137
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:30,735
I know it's
the right call.

138
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:35,047
I just don't know what to
do with my time, and my leg.

139
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,082
Pain's flared up
since I left Mayfield.

140
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,947
Ibuprofen's barely
putting a dent in it.

141
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:41,810
You need a hobby.

142
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,288
Right. Doctors the world
over treat chronic pain

143
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,847
with collections
of Hummel figurines.

144
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,859
No, I didn't say
you need a lame hobby.

145
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:51,693
You need something to keep you
engaged, connected to other people.

146
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,664
You already made me
get a roommate.

147
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:54,893
Wilson's got
one bedroom.

148
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:58,027
I don't think we can get any
more connected without unzipping.

149
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:01,096
Okay. So what does
Wilson like to do?

150
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,379
Vince, I'm Dr. Foreman,
Head of Diagnostics.

151
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,711
So you must be
the genius's replacement.

152
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,513
I prefer to think of
myself as Genius 2.0.

153
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,213
Your blood test ruled
out mercury poisoning.

154
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,017
What was my mercury
level? Two-point-eight.

155
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,181
That means for every
deciliter of blood...

156
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,589
I know what it means. I
also know it's above normal.

157
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,787
I want mercury chelation.

158
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,092
Your level isn't elevated
enough to produce your symptoms.

159
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,224
You can't know that until we de-elevate
it and see if my pain improves.

160
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,791
It's a judgment call.

161
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,099
Based on 10 years
of medical training?

162
00:09:32,171 --> 00:09:34,901
I think you have CRPS. I want
to try spinal stimulation.

163
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:40,037
So, basically, you want to shove a needle
in my spine based on a glorified hunch.

164
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,171
I'll stick with
the chelation.

165
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:47,717
If you don't want to get
better, I think we're done.

166
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,085
What do you mean "done"?

167
00:09:50,156 --> 00:09:52,124
You're not interested
in my medical opinion.

168
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,624
I'll move on to
my next patient,

169
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,819
you'll move on
to a doctor

170
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,589
willing to run
all the unnecessary tests

171
00:09:56,662 --> 00:10:00,564
and procedures you want. Or you
can stick around and be cured.

172
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,226
Makes no difference to me.

173
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,536
I'm glad you
changed your mind.

174
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:10,168
Don't know about that.

175
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:13,006
Dr. Foreman basically
strong-armed me.

176
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,869
Which is impressive.

177
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,211
Stimulating at 100 hertz.

178
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,775
Guess you found him a little more
persuasive than the two of us.

179
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:22,684
Probably the pants.

180
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,313
He reminds me of me.

181
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:26,983
Is it supposed to hurt?

182
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,356
Not if we're
in correctly.

183
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,224
Is it your hands?
Your back?

184
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,854
No, my chest.

185
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,829
Can't breathe.

186
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,595
Heart rate's 140,
climbing.

187
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,330
You need to hold still.

188
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,463
What did you do?

189
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,731
Deep breaths.

190
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,543
His lungs are
filling with fluid.

191
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:54,312
Analysis of the fluid from Vince's
lungs shows the lung problem

192
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:55,718
is really
a heart problem.

193
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,756
He's got a thickened
left ventricle.

194
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,415
When his heart sped up
during the procedure,

195
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,984
it jacked up the pressure in his
lungs, causing pulmonary edema.

196
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,257
Good thing I talked the
patient into spinal stimulation.

197
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,322
It did lead us to
discovering a new symptom,

198
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,163
and proved he was wrong
about mercury poisoning.

199
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,668
We lucked into
that discovery,

200
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,966
and we were wrong
about CRPS.

201
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,470
Ventricular thickening plus
neuropathy could equal Lyme disease.

202
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,770
Not without joint pain.

203
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,811
When's his new game
coming out?

204
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,903
Couple of months.

205
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,038
He's probably
working non-stop.

206
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,014
Might be using more than
coffee to power through.

207
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,880
Cocaine use
explains his symptoms.

208
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,714
So we search his
office for drugs.

209
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:30,153
No. We're gonna ask him.

210
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,996
In a lot of ways,
cooking is like music.

211
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,660
Different elements
combine to make a symphony.

212
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:44,162
<i>Difference is that
Beethoven's Fifth</i>

213
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,431
isn't going to
be poop tomorrow.

214
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:47,938
What was
my one condition

215
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,998
for allowing you
to tag along?

216
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,668
Try not to be a jerk.

217
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,939
I'm trying.
I'm just failing.

218
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,745
Roll your meatballs
and keep an open mind.

219
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:04,420
How hard are you trying not
to make a ball joke right now?

220
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,117
They're smoking.

221
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,725
Your balls.

222
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,091
Oh.

223
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,392
No, no. They're browning
way too fast.

224
00:12:12,465 --> 00:12:14,057
Blue's the color
you gotta watch out for.

225
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,657
Enough.

226
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,636
God, they're...
They're still raw inside.

227
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,695
By the time they're cooked
through, the outside will be burnt.

228
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,765
I think there's
a medicated powder for that.

229
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,612
Although,
vinegar could work.

230
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,974
My old chem prof
talked about

231
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:33,211
theoretically
you shouldn't trust

232
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,276
the results of
a hemoglobin A1C test

233
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,754
on a chronically
acidotic patient.

234
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,991
The acid in the blood
slows the reaction

235
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,085
between the hemoglobin
protein and blood sugar.

236
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,096
Browning meat is the
same chemical process,

237
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,895
which means it should
also be slowed by acid.

238
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,959
That actually
makes sense.

239
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,600
You might have
saved my balls.

240
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,334
That's the spirit!

241
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,301
Obviously the procedure
didn't go as planned.

242
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:01,710
The heart problem
was unforeseeable,

243
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,339
but I still feel
responsible.

244
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,404
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,643
Okay.

246
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,414
How long have you guys
been doing it?

247
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:11,622
I think it's best if we
kept things professional.

248
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,816
Tough to do,
now that I've seen

249
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,484
you rock
a leopard-print bikini.

250
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,858
Congrats, by the way.
Up top.

251
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:19,625
You hacked
my profile page?

252
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,563
Your treatment nearly
gave me a heart attack.

253
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,135
<i>Figured I'd check if you had the
credentials to go with the cojones,</i>

254
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,295
one search
led to another.

255
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:26,497
Is there a shot
of just her?

256
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:27,800
I'm thinking screensaver.

257
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,500
We need to know if
you've been using cocaine.

258
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:31,634
Nope. Dude,
you just block everybody

259
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,041
or do you really
only have three friends?

260
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:34,739
We need you to be
straight with us.

261
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,248
We need to be
able to trust you.

262
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,915
I cleaned up my act
12 years ago,

263
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,817
after my college
roommate OD'd.

264
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,053
Okay.

265
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,191
Search his office.

266
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:57,292
You think he was lying?

267
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,927
No, but I'm not sure.

268
00:13:59,004 --> 00:13:59,993
It was worth asking.

269
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,562
If he'd said yes, it
would've saved us a trip.

270
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,301
But he didn't.

271
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,407
You have to forget
about him.

272
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,503
The patient?
House.

273
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,105
First you try
acting like him,

274
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,241
that doesn't work, so
then you try the opposite.

275
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,412
Now you're mad because
you have to use his move.

276
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,989
I feel like
Tom Brady's backup.

277
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:20,753
Tom Brady's backup
now makes $10 million.

278
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:24,159
Stop comparing. You can
do this by being you.

279
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,327
We should still check out his
office, talk to his co-workers.

280
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,389
I'll get Taub.

281
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,457
And

282
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32,832
thanks.

283
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,797
Oh. And dinner
tonight at 7:00.

284
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,899
Can we make it 8:00?

285
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,035
Already made
a reservation for 7:00.

286
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,348
Hi.

287
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,577
I'm making gnocchi.

288
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:54,055
Oh, I didn't mean
to intrude, I just...

289
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:56,686
Cecile's in
my cooking class.

290
00:14:56,762 --> 00:14:57,820
She doesn't
speak English.

291
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,430
You bake the potatoes
instead of boiling.

292
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,600
Less moisture, fewer gluten
bonds, lighter gnocchi.

293
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,836
You seem good.

294
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,037
Feeling better.

295
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:21,011
House.

296
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,917
I need to talk to you about
your leaving the hospital.

297
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:25,548
I do love a good groveling,
but my decision is final.

298
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,787
That's fine, as long as
I'm not the reason for it.

299
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,488
I know that sounds
completely narcissistic.

300
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,154
Yeah.

301
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,960
But it's not. We flirted,
we kissed, I fondled.

302
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,032
I hallucinated
a night with you

303
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,573
and yelled it from
a hospital balcony.

304
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,541
You're not a narcissist.

305
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,105
So what am I?

306
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,305
Not the reason
I'm leaving.

307
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,349
House.

308
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,852
I'm gonna miss you.

309
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,491
Lady, either kiss him or
leave. We got work to do.

310
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,786
You just couldn't
keep your trap shut.

311
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:06,990
Make the damn gnocchi.

312
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,124
Bye.

313
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,400
I guess you're
not in a hurry

314
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,103
to get back
to the office.

315
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:20,202
And you are?

316
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,845
I'm not trying to
avoid my boyfriend.

317
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,655
I'm a lizard,
not an idiot.

318
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,213
You've been
in a crappy mood

319
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,384
since we got
in the car.

320
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,020
And you're completely okay with
being ordered around by someone

321
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,190
who 24 hours ago was
basically your equal?

322
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:42,995
Unlike you, I didn't
expect anything different.

323
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:45,662
The work part
I can get used to.

324
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:49,538
He didn't ask me to go to
dinner, he told me we were going.

325
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,274
He's never
done that before.

326
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,370
So even the score.
Go home tonight,

327
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,142
put on some heels and
break him like a pony.

328
00:16:57,216 --> 00:17:00,481
You'll feel much better.
What?

329
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,119
That's one big-ass bird.

330
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,024
Wow.
That's kind of amazing,

331
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:18,296
the way the wings move,
it's so real.

332
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,201
Get them off me!

333
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,965
I know what's wrong
with the patient.

334
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,907
I'm going
to call Foreman.

335
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,369
A little help.

336
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,148
Your partner said
you studied birds

337
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,547
to improve
the game animation.

338
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,643
Did you touch them? Can't
dissect without touching.

339
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:36,084
It's the best way to
understand the anatomy.

340
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:39,318
It's also a good way to contract
an infection called psittacosis.

341
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,951
We spoke to Dr. Foreman, he
wants to start you on antibiotics.

342
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:46,327
Does that infection cause
problems in the joystick area?

343
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,831
Kind of stuck
in play mode.

344
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,733
Yes, we get it.
She's very, very pretty.

345
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,601
It's not her.
I mean, it was,

346
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,833
when she was here with her
boyfriend three hours ago.

347
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,908
You've had an erection
for three hours?

348
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,573
At first, it was
just embarrassing,

349
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,114
but now it's
really starting to hurt.

350
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,376
Will the antibiotics help?

351
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,510
I'm afraid not.
This isn't psittacosis.

352
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,284
His erection persisted
even with medication.

353
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,791
We had to put in
a surgical shunt

354
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,088
just to
drain the blood.

355
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,460
You missed dinner. And a shunt
doesn't require both of you.

356
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:23,228
I'm dedicated. So, the holy
trinity, heart, hands, hose.

357
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,326
Could be
Guillain-Barré.

358
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:27,031
Not with normal
nerve conduction.

359
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,463
Thrombocytosis.

360
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,303
His platelet count
isn't that high.

361
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:31,569
Brain tumor
makes more sense.

362
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:38,610
I'm sorry, I just realized.
Joint pain and joint pain.

363
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:40,844
Honest,
I wasn't laughing

364
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,047
because of the obvious
tension between the two of you.

365
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:48,156
Erection points to a circulatory
problem. I'm with Foreman.

366
00:18:48,227 --> 00:18:49,660
It is possible for a
brain tumor to cause...

367
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:52,993
We're going with
thrombocytosis.

368
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:54,659
Okay.

369
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,500
You're mad I didn't
ask you to dinner?

370
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,970
How long have
we been dating?

371
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,165
It felt like an order.

372
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,265
Your tone of voice was...

373
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,331
My tone?

374
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,433
I'm under a little
pressure right now.

375
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,569
How about
giving me a break?

376
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,306
Look, this is tough
for both of us,

377
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,245
except I haven't
just gotten a promotion.

378
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,183
So, now you're jealous?

379
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,151
No. I'm just saying
don't complain

380
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,744
about the burdens of
command to your employees.

381
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,484
I was complaining
to my girlfriend.

382
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:21,787
Who are those guys?

383
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,760
I have no idea.

384
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,662
Meet the competition.

385
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,102
Steve Paulson,
Neurology, St. Mark's.

386
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,161
Nice to meet you.

387
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,263
You called
another doctor?

388
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,207
Lots of other doctors. I posted
my symptoms on the Internet.

389
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:40,438
You guys are 0-for-2. I thought
I'd look for some backup.

390
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,140
I can cure all your symptoms
with my papaya toxin cleanse.

391
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,547
Month's supply, $395.

392
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,943
Okay, that guy's an idiot.
That doesn't mean they all are.

393
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,488
Neither one of you have
privileges at this hospital,

394
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,990
please leave. Now.

395
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,619
Dr. Foreman,
sorry for the intrusion,

396
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,323
but I notice you haven't
done a head MRI yet.

397
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,422
Because he doesn't
need one.

398
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,057
I'm pretty sure
he's got a brain tumor.

399
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:05,297
We considered that and concluded
thrombocytosis is more likely.

400
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,837
I'm starting him
on hydroxyurea.

401
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,533
His platelets don't seem
anywhere near high enough.

402
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,632
If you took an image,
I'm sure...

403
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,472
There are no signs
of increased ICP.

404
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,512
I'm not delaying treatment.
Looks like we need a tiebreaker.

405
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,810
Dr. Hadley,
what do you think?

406
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,042
I think both theories
have merit.

407
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,078
So, brain tumor, otherwise
you'd back your bosslboyfriend.

408
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,749
I want an MRI.

409
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,258
Fine. I'll set it up.

410
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,302
Great, you're up.
I need a taster.

411
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:46,633
Ragú with pork sausage,
beef thigh, no cream.

412
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,977
It's a little early.

413
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,849
Did you even go
to bed last night?

414
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,621
Bed is for sissies.

415
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,288
Unless you're having sex,
in which case...

416
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,127
No, bed is still
for sissies.

417
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,168
Doesn't this seem
a little bit obsessive?

418
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:12,362
You should have been here
when I was butchering the ox.

419
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,631
What do you expect?
I'm an addict,

420
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,831
I turn everything
up to 11.

421
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:17,397
Yeah, I thought you were
trying to tone that down.

422
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,876
No, I'm just trying to find
something I can set at 11

423
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,435
without blowing
out my eardrums.

424
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,378
Star anise with
the caramelized onions,

425
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,576
the sulfur compounds
bring out the meat flavor.

426
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,215
I couldn't sleep
because of my leg.

427
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,284
It was either make ragù or go out
on the street looking to score.

428
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:44,499
Good choice.
So, so good.

429
00:21:52,844 --> 00:21:54,505
He asked me a question,
I answered.

430
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,046
You told me to make
my own decisions,

431
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,479
I do, and you stab me
in the back.

432
00:21:57,549 --> 00:21:58,880
I didn't even say
what I really thought.

433
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,214
I hedged, and I don't
like that I hedged.

434
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:02,344
If I have
a legitimate opinion...

435
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,252
You express it
in private.

436
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,791
In public, the team
opinion is your opinion.

437
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:09,656
Except the team opinion
is your opinion.

438
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,620
That's my job.
And what's mine?

439
00:22:11,697 --> 00:22:14,393
To lie when I'm asked
a direct question?

440
00:22:15,634 --> 00:22:17,158
You would have
done it for House.

441
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,135
Maybe you just don't
want me to succeed.

442
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,434
Maybe you just want
to kick me again

443
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,474
for not asking you
to dinner.

444
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,409
At least when House was
being an unbelievable jerk,

445
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,241
I could talk to
my boyfriend about it.

446
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:31,908
I may be a jerk, but
you're wrong. MRI is clean.

447
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:35,411
Treat for thrombocytosis.

448
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,628
You're early.

449
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,159
For what?

450
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:50,292
I knew you'd show up here
complaining about Foreman.

451
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,167
I thought you'd hold out
for another week at least.

452
00:22:53,238 --> 00:22:55,331
I showed up to ask if
you've seen thromobocytosis

453
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,499
with a platelet
count under...

454
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:59,544
I went crazy,
not stupid.

455
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:02,876
I leave, Foreman
embraces his inner Mugabe.

456
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:04,804
What's that?

457
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,078
Embryonali.
Unhatched chicken egg.

458
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,653
I'm going to suck out some of
the yolk and replace it with ragù.

459
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,248
By the way, you can
tell the other lepers

460
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:15,816
that their absence
has been noted.

461
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,020
Cameron didn't come by?

462
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:20,189
Daddy's little co-dependent
is all grown up.

463
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,333
Making room for Daddy's hot
bisexual with boyfriend problems.

464
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,530
It's not a problem,
it's...

465
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,101
Okay, it's a problem.

466
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:35,510
I mean, I get it, the patient's a
nightmare. He posted his case online.

467
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:38,381
You know Foreman,
you know the situation.

468
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,543
How can I get him
to tone it down?

469
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,143
Stop being a coward,
for one thing.

470
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,482
He's the one who's
afraid of failure.

471
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,080
In a job that no one
before me has ever done.

472
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,149
His fears are justified.

473
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:50,353
You're just afraid of
giving him control over you.

474
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,453
Which might work
at home,

475
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,691
but makes it almost impossible
for him to do his job.

476
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,665
Pass me those crackers.

477
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:59,134
You're saying
this is all my fault?

478
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:01,604
I'm saying

479
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,699
that you would be happier if you
learned when it's okay to give in.

480
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,036
What?

481
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,742
You just suggested that I give
in so that I could be happy.

482
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,948
What did they do
to you in there?

483
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,213
Taste this.

484
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,465
Oh, my God.

485
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,728
This might be the best
thing I've ever eaten.

486
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:39,008
And, yes, I'm including
what you're thinking of now.

487
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,068
You're an amazing cook!

488
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,642
I know.

489
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,318
And yet, my leg hurts.

490
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:51,813
Fire her.

491
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,879
I'm not
gonna fire her.

492
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,016
Then stop being
such a wuss.

493
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:55,218
I am not being a wuss.

494
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:57,386
Challenging you
is part of her job.

495
00:24:57,462 --> 00:24:59,225
But when she does it,
you take it personally.

496
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,855
So you're saying
this is my fault.

497
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:04,433
I was trying to bury it
a little, but, yeah.

498
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,233
You gotta eliminate either
the challenge or the reaction.

499
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:09,637
Or we could stick
with my original plan.

500
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,972
We get drunk and talk
about how girls are lame.

501
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:16,307
Yeah, this problem
will go away on its own.

502
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,522
It's 8:00
in the morning.

503
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:28,752
Coffee ice cream.

504
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,529
No frittata,
no bombolini?

505
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,155
Started thinking
about what you said,

506
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:37,793
about me obsessing. Started
obsessing about obsessing,

507
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:38,995
decided to take a day off.

508
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:41,334
You were
enjoying cooking.

509
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,137
How like a man
to think that I enjoy

510
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,767
slaving over
a hot stove all day

511
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:47,436
while you're off
banging secretaries.

512
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,776
You said it was keeping
your mind off the pain.

513
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:53,545
<i>That was before I discovered The
Biggest Loser marathon on cable.</i>

514
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,382
I like to pretend
they can see me eating.

515
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:58,848
And your leg?

516
00:25:58,924 --> 00:26:00,016
It's fine.

517
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,660
My leg's killing me.

518
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,156
Cooking helped
for a while,

519
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,724
then I guess
I got bored.

520
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:12,292
My leg started
hurting again.

521
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,838
Then I got worried, and
that made the pain worse.

522
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,703
What are you
worried about?

523
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,640
That nothing's
gonna help.

524
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,679
That I end up in
the Very Dark Place.

525
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:27,479
I'm fine,
I'm just not happy.

526
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:29,144
I didn't let you out
because you were happy.

527
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,414
I let you out
because I believe

528
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,513
you have the skills
to cope with that.

529
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,958
You tried one thing, it
didn't work, so move on.

530
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,554
Write, play chess...

531
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,654
What if nothing works?

532
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,426
What if nothing gives me
more than a few days

533
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,626
before my brain starts
looking for the next fix,

534
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,728
before my leg feels like
someone's shoving nails into it.

535
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,864
What do I do then?

536
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,273
If nothing in the world
can hold your interest,

537
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,345
we'll deal with that
when we get to it.

538
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:58,780
But you have to trust me,
and you have to be patient.

539
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,056
I brought you a donut.

540
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,960
The florist was closed.

541
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,262
I'll get a vase
and put it in water.

542
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,835
You know I'm sorry,
right?

543
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,195
I'm sorry, too.

544
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,473
Do you think

545
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,475
we could start over?

546
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,273
That's a fantastic idea.

547
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,483
We're gonna be late.

548
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:38,647
Your boss won't mind.

549
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,595
No way.

550
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:49,999
His lymph nodes
blew up.

551
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,501
He's been treated
for thrombocytosis,

552
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,866
but there's been
no change.

553
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:53,961
I was wrong.

554
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,404
God, you are a genius.

555
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:56,997
I'm adding this
to my list of symptoms.

556
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:58,064
That didn't work
last time.

557
00:27:58,143 --> 00:27:59,770
Because I didn't
think big enough.

558
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,312
Now I'm offering
a $25,000 reward.

559
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:56,959
Steroids reduced
his facial swelling.

560
00:28:57,035 --> 00:28:59,094
Swollen lymph nodes
rule out thrombocytosis.

561
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:01,161
How did so many people
get my personal e-mail?

562
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,934
The Internet is
a magical place.

563
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,334
Lymph enlargement makes
me think polyarteritis.

564
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,002
You were saying?

565
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:13,048
No point in treating the
symptom and not the disease.

566
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,346
Your stunt generated
quite a few responses.

567
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,821
Let's take a look.
I'm way ahead of you.

568
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,256
Paraneoplastic syndrome
secondary to spinal tumor.

569
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:24,295
No. No hypercalcemia, no
muscle spasms or incontinence.

570
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,592
You are possessed by the
Biblical demon Legion.

571
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,689
No. No jumping off a cliff
in a herd of pigs.

572
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,961
Otherwise, it did fit.

573
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,023
Graves' disease.

574
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,660
No. Thyroid levels
are normal.

575
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,068
You want us to
spend next few days

576
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,436
shooting down every
theory in the world,

577
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,532
or can we do our jobs and
come up with one that works?

578
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,339
I want you to test me
for amyloidosis.

579
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,673
Is that your
professional opinion?

580
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,077
It's the wisdom
of crowds.

581
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,672
Studies show that
collective decision

582
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:47,684
of a group can be more accurate
than any individual's decision.

583
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,448
I went through my e-mails,
amyloidosis got the most votes.

584
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:51,989
If you had amyloidosis,

585
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,990
there'd be speckling
on your cardiac ultrasound.

586
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,117
In 100% of cases?

587
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,892
Fine.
I'll make you a deal.

588
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,330
We do a kidney biopsy
to test for amyloidosis.

589
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,458
When it comes back
negative,

590
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:06,732
you pull your case off of the
Internet and retract the reward.

591
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,501
It's either that or
I don't test you at all.

592
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:11,935
Deal.

593
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,021
If you wanted a quickie,
you should have called ahead.

594
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,613
I'm a mess.

595
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,417
I came home for lunch.

596
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,485
You have lunch with Cuddy
on Tuesdays.

597
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,224
She was busy.

598
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,925
And you're
checking up on me.

599
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:40,834
You know, you can talk to
me... Is that my laundry?

600
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,601
You were running out of
socks for me to borrow.

601
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,468
We have plenty
of underwear, though.

602
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,774
I'm fine.

603
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,104
You said that
this morning.

604
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,706
And consistency
proves what?

605
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:56,481
Really, I'm good. I'll
put these in your room.

606
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:02,820
<i>You always hurt
the one you love</i>

607
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:15,170
Biopsy showed deposits in the renal
endothelium consistent with amyloidosis.

608
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,875
The Internet was right.
Start him on dexamethasone.

609
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,205
Already done.

610
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:24,237
This may not be the best
time for this, but I quit.

611
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,845
I got an offer to join a
friend's surgical practice.

612
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,954
You don't
generally get an offer

613
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:32,455
unless you're
looking for one.

614
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,583
I put out some feelers when I
found out House wasn't coming back.

615
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,389
I lobbied to keep
the department open

616
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,623
so you could
keep your job.

617
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:43,326
Yes, that was incredibly
altruistic of you.

618
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:51,075
It's nothing personal. Actually,
I think you're doing pretty well.

619
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:55,635
But I came here
to work with House.

620
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,482
He's a jerk. We'll be fine without him.

621
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,720
Do you know how many
resumes we get every day

622
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,351
without even asking?

623
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,158
Might be a few less
after Cuddy shuts us down.

624
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:16,556
The case got solved
under your watch,

625
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:18,499
does it really matter
how it happened?

626
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:22,037
It matters.

627
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,310
What if I'm just not
ready for this job?

628
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:33,109
Okay, you're sad.

629
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,751
I could tell you
the story about me

630
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,618
and my roommate
at Sarah Lawrence.

631
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:40,617
Okay.

632
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:48,689
Her name was Lindsey, and she
was a cheerleader from Iowa.

633
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:54,168
I broke my toilet
this morning.

634
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,430
I'll get my tools.

635
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:01,376
I blocked the intake valve so I
could collect some of House's urine.

636
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,539
Cuddy,
he was barely limping.

637
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:04,672
What did the lab say?

638
00:33:04,749 --> 00:33:06,341
The urine was clean
for Vicodin.

639
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:09,875
It did however contain
strange epithelial cells.

640
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:13,720
Further analysis showed they
were from a Labrador Retriever.

641
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:16,923
Damn.

642
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:19,786
He's using.

643
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,453
Vince, Vince.
Vince, relax.

644
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,689
It's Dr. Foreman.

645
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:31,928
Kill it! Kill it! No!
I don't have my blaster.

646
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,030
He's hallucinating
'cause he's burning up.

647
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:39,001
Amyloidosis wouldn't
do this.

648
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,174
Antipyretics
didn't work.

649
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:49,270
Hopefully the cold tub
will get his temp down.

650
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,474
Maybe we should see if
anyone's sent in other ideas.

651
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,778
Maybe the reward
money attracted...

652
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,183
No, I'm not letting
anyone else jerk us around.

653
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:58,518
The masses were wrong
about amyloidosis.

654
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,056
They don't know
about the fever.

655
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:03,355
I'm going with Light-Chain
Deposition Disorder.

656
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,452
You okay with that?

657
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,588
Yes.

658
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:18,531
We think you have
a disease called LCDD.

659
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:20,702
It causes proteins to
build up in your organs.

660
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,177
You think?

661
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:26,249
We can't definitely
confirm the diagnosis.

662
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:27,911
And our only chance
of beating this

663
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:30,886
would be to start you on
high-dose chemotherapy.

664
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:35,119
But I do have to warn you that in
your condition, it might kill you.

665
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,490
Do you want me to get you
some more information?

666
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,563
You're my doctor,
I trust you.

667
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,101
No, you don't.

668
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:51,733
You're scared, and you don't
want to make this decision.

669
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,317
My career is
riding on this case.

670
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,379
Nowhere near as
important as your life.

671
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:13,023
But I think the best shot for
both of us is to treat for LCDD.

672
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,326
Okay.

673
00:37:19,103 --> 00:37:22,800
All right. Let's get you out
of this tub and into chemo.

674
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:28,772
We know you're
back on Vicodin.

675
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:29,870
No.

676
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,744
The only thing you know
is that I'm a genius

677
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,148
who got a dog to pee
in your toilet.

678
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,651
You don't know
how I did it,

679
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,052
or, more interestingly,
where I peed.

680
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,181
House, you've spent
the last three months...

681
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,953
<i>Et tu, Butte?</i>

682
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:43,015
You got no reason
to be here,

683
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,254
he's the one
I was jerking around.

684
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:45,886
Why is your leg better?

685
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:49,057
Ow! It hurts.
Please go away now.

686
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,259
If you really think
I'm using,

687
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:52,598
how about asking me before
taking a wrench to your plumbing?

688
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,762
House,
you're an addict.

689
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,898
You can't be surprised if we
can't take you at your word.

690
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:01,911
Fine. Let's get you some
proof. Hide your eyes, ladies.

691
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,275
House.
You, too.

692
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,585
My godson
made me that mug.

693
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:13,556
If the lab says
this is Retriever, too,

694
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,023
please let me
know right away.

695
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,559
It'd explain my
overwhelming desire

696
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,187
to wipe my butt
on your carpet.

697
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:24,067
Thank you for
dragging me into this.

698
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,417
Stop the chemo,
he's got Fabry's disease.

699
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,548
He was in a tub
for an hour,

700
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,752
his fingers should have
pruned, but they didn't.

701
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:53,319
Already stopped chemo,
and confirmed Fabry's.

702
00:38:53,397 --> 00:38:56,992
I'm glad you both agree but
could somebody loop me in here?

703
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:58,899
We assumed the deposits
in your kidneys

704
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,062
were proteins,
but they were fats.

705
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:04,505
Fabry's makes them build up in
your organs, choke your nerves,

706
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,100
keep your fingers
from pruning in water.

707
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,645
It's chronic
but manageable.

708
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,738
How did you
figure it out?

709
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,043
lodide mumps.

710
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:19,180
His lymph nodes swelled
up after the head CT.

711
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,554
We thought it was a new
symptom, but it wasn't,

712
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,388
it was a reaction
to the contrast.

713
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,452
lodide mumps takes lymph
nodes off the table.

714
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,690
Remove that symptom...

715
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,858
And that just
came to you?

716
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,928
I looked through
the online responses again.

717
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,996
Someone posted it
this morning.

718
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:52,552
I heard Cuddy
made it official.

719
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,217
Department's yours.
Congrats.

720
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,261
I'm sorry.

721
00:40:02,366 --> 00:40:04,266
I went behind your back.

722
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,236
On a scale of one to 10,
how mad are you?

723
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:12,103
A seven.
And that's stupid.

724
00:40:13,444 --> 00:40:14,741
You did the right thing.

725
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,871
It's my fault you thought
you had to go behind my back.

726
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,073
I should have
stood up to you.

727
00:40:18,149 --> 00:40:21,243
But you didn't 'cause you
didn't want to fight again.

728
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:27,153
It's our first case,
it'll take time to adjust.

729
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,791
What if by the time
we get adjusted,

730
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:35,457
we don't like
each other any more?

731
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,727
That's not
gonna happen.

732
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:37,961
Are you sure?

733
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,263
'Cause ever since
I took this job,

734
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:42,499
we've been making
each other miserable.

735
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,374
I really don't think
this is gonna work.

736
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:56,785
You're breaking up
with me?

737
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:57,912
No.

738
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:01,754
The other night, when I thought
I was done, you were there.

739
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,825
I need you.

740
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,121
I don't want
to lose you.

741
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,931
Then, why are you...

742
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:21,372
You're firing me.

743
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,216
I'm sorry.

744
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,489
I slipped.

745
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,820
You took Vicodin?

746
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,134
$25,000.

747
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,305
I solved
my old team's case.

748
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:54,107
I was about to take the
pills, I went online,

749
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,011
I found people
posting medical problems.

750
00:41:57,081 --> 00:42:01,415
And my leg
stopped hurting.

751
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,113
Oh.

752
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:07,716
Oh?

753
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,719
I'm supposed to be changing
my life. This is not a change.

754
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,855
Maybe I was wrong.

755
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:17,264
Says the guy making
sand castles in my brain.

756
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,824
We need to keep you
from using.

757
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,098
Taking your job away,
the medical puzzles,

758
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,695
nearly drove you
back to it.

759
00:42:22,773 --> 00:42:27,972
Maybe diagnostic medicine is
the key to keeping you clean.

760
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,646
So you're okay with me
going online, solving cases?

761
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,945
No.

762
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,747
You can't sit all day
in a room by yourself.

763
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:40,381
Isolation fosters
depression.

764
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:42,425
The hospital is
part of my old life.

765
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:45,894
If I go back,
I might become

766
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,022
who I was before,
pills and all.

767
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:50,032
That's a possibility.

768
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,330
But could be,

769
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,736
the only thing worse for you than
going back to diagnostic medicine

770
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,069
is not going back.

771
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,647
Guess we're gonna find out.
