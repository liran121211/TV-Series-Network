1
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,127
A crane collapsed
in downtown Trenton.

2
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,568
Don't care.

3
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:44,634
My great-grandfather.

4
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,508
No, it's just
a book he wrote.

5
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,247
Open it up.

6
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:55,478
Seriously? You're giving this to us?

7
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:56,986
It's a big step
you're taking.

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,854
I wanted to
congratulate you.

9
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,859
I understand that's
the adult thing to do.

10
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:02,394
How did you know?

11
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,054
I've known
for a while.

12
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,123
The fact that you decided to
cohabitate is not exactly a spoiler.

13
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:10,526
Unless my intel
is wrong.

14
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,171
Trouble in paradise?

15
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,900
We have to get
to Trenton.

16
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:00,079
Somebody, help me.

17
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,327
Can you hear me?

18
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,597
Hmm.

19
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,702
Did that sound
like a "yes"?

20
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,674
Sir, we have to get you to
the OR. You have a bad wound,

21
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:59,371
but we're gonna pack it and
transport you as fast as we can.

22
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,006
Skull fracture. Glasgow Coma
score of 11. She's immediate.

23
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,286
Move on.
This guy's dead.

24
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,343
His wounds aren't so...

25
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:11,253
Forget the wound,
look at his toes.

26
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,691
Atherosclerotic emboli. He'll
never survive the surgery.

27
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:16,285
Maybe his shoes
were too tight.

28
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,229
It's not the shoes,
skin shows smoker's facies.

29
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,527
He's not gonna
make it to morning.

30
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,033
He'll just take up
an ambulance ride,

31
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,466
surgeons' time
and an ICU bed.

32
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,134
He's expectant.
Leave him.

33
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,745
I only nodded off
for a second.

34
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,372
I lost control of the
load. I'm so sorry.

35
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,075
Don't worry. We're gonna
get you out of here.

36
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,674
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:39,877
He's secure.
Ready?

38
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,352
Three, two, one.

39
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,522
Crane operator. He made
it through amazingly well.

40
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,591
Lucid and responsive, stable
fracture, right humerus.

41
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,291
Haven't gotten to
his lower half yet.

42
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,996
Tell me when
something hurts.

43
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,637
I fell asleep,
killed all those people.

44
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:00,730
Something other
than your conscience.

45
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,440
Is that a pill
in your pocket

46
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:06,876
or are you just happy to have
a tiny, pill-shaped penis?

47
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:10,008
Caffeine pills.

48
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:12,150
You fell asleep
taking these?

49
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,810
I drank two cups
of coffee, too.

50
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,245
Is that normal for you?

51
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,345
No, I hate coffee.

52
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,856
I'm working on no sleep.
My daughter has the flu.

53
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,916
This much caffeine
for a coffee virgin...

54
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,862
There's no way he fell
asleep. He passed out.

55
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,157
Which means
a neurological disorder

56
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,824
caused the crash,
not fatigue.

57
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:30,426
Hey!

58
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:33,369
We're taking the crane
operator back to Princeton.

59
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,270
They said he was barely
hurt, he can wait.

60
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,200
Steal an ambulance
and call the team.

61
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,301
Tell them
we've got a case.

62
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,176
House, no.
I need you here.

63
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,872
But he needs me there, and
he moans louder than you do.

64
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,645
There were over 100
people in that building,

65
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,379
only 76 have
been accounted for.

66
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,286
Foreman and your team can handle
the crane operator for now.

67
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:13,469
Having fun down there?

68
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,535
<i>Lots!</i>

69
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:17,372
Every time Cuddy
leans over a patient,

70
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,882
it's another opportunity
for a downblouse nipslip.

71
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,254
What's going on
between her and Lucas?

72
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,688
Besides them
moving in together?

73
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,917
That's not enough
for you?

74
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,989
I gave her the
housewarming gift earlier,

75
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,722
and she paused
for a split second,

76
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,595
like she was
hiding something.

77
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,324
It's probably her moral
revulsion at housewarming gifts.

78
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,365
Or maybe she didn't
want to accept a gift

79
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,996
for something she
wasn't gonna do.

80
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,609
<i>You actually think they're
not moving in together?</i>

81
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,943
What was that?
You okay?

82
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,070
<i>Yeah.</i>

83
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:49,873
Vending machine
collapsed.

84
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,814
She still using your
ex-wife as her realtor?

85
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:54,113
<i>As far as I know.</i>

86
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:57,720
<i>Well, know a little farther,
will you? Look into it.</i>

87
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,949
Hey!

88
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,721
Somebody down here!

89
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,796
If you can hear me, tap
three times or call out.

90
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,837
Is anyone there?

91
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,669
I'm not
getting anything.

92
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,973
I heard something. There's
got to be a void down there.

93
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,345
There's a million voids down
there, it was the parking garage.

94
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,907
But our equipment hasn't
picked up any movement,

95
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,213
dogs haven't
picked up any scent.

96
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,446
There's smashed
cars down there,

97
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,250
you don't think that gasoline
could throw off their scent?

98
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,119
We gotta get back
to work, okay?

99
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,751
We'll get to this area soon. Excuse me.

100
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,112
Anybody hear me?

101
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,589
Hey! Can anybody
hear me?

102
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:16,285
Help me.

103
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,822
What's your name?

104
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,795
Please...

105
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,465
My husband's gift...

106
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:39,443
I was supposed to pick it up
at the framers. It's on Elm.

107
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:40,706
You should have
told me earlier,

108
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,873
I could've picked
it up on the way.

109
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,109
What's your name?

110
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,949
It's a picture from our
Tortola trip for his birthday.

111
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,247
I'm not asking your name
because I wanna become friends.

112
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,081
I'm trying to gauge
your mental state.

113
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,422
Hanna.

114
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,593
Okay, that's a start.
What day of the week is it?

115
00:09:58,798 --> 00:09:59,787
Tuesday.

116
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:00,889
Better still.

117
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:03,828
What happened?

118
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:07,438
You know that giant
construction crane next door?

119
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,201
It's kind of on top
of you right now.

120
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,401
Okay, I'm gonna
try to pull you out.

121
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,678
Ow! My leg!

122
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,512
Okay. Okay.

123
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:26,382
I really need
to get help.

124
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,790
No. Stay.

125
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,521
Someone else will come.

126
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:30,857
No one knows
I'm down here.

127
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,164
Please! Stay with me!

128
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,590
Don't leave me
in the dark!

129
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,329
I'll be right back.

130
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,995
No! Don't leave me
in the dark!

131
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:41,301
Please stay!

132
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,205
He's still in the ER,
House.

133
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,712
We haven't had time
to start a differential.

134
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,875
Perfect, we'll start right
now. Put me on speaker.

135
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,819
What causes syncope?

136
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,253
Your guy's stable. The
two dozen other patients...

137
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,552
Don't need
to be diagnosed,

138
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,320
they just need
to be bandaged.

139
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,157
What causes syncope?

140
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,424
Vasovagal reaction.

141
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,159
Meningioma,
sick sinus syndrome...

142
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,861
<i>Or you're wrong
and he just fell asleep.</i>

143
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,493
How's he gonna sleep
with 50 cups of coffee

144
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,662
going through
his veins?

145
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:13,762
Were you never
a medical resident?

146
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,338
I hear Ten, Eleven and
Twelve. Where's Thirteen?

147
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,502
She's not here.

148
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:19,635
And answer to your
next question is,

149
00:11:19,712 --> 00:11:20,770
"I don't know
where she is. "

150
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,609
Do you have the answer
to my question after that?

151
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,480
<i>A space-occupying lesion
in his brain is most likely.</i>

152
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,118
MRI will prove
I'm right.

153
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,944
Or it'll just prove he suffered
head trauma from the crash.

154
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,387
Which we'd want
to find anyway.

155
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,925
Two birds with
one scan. Do it.

156
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:36,957
Having trouble finding
a vein for Hanna's IV.

157
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,890
Is she getting weaker?
Paler?

158
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,022
No, no, she's stable.

159
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:43,296
That means her blood loss is
minimal. It buys us some time.

160
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,802
Get the IV
into her tibia.

161
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,703
It's almost hollow, feeds
into the venous system.

162
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,967
Which they, obviously, don't
teach you in EMT school.

163
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,657
This side's still leaning pretty
bad, got to shore up this beam.

164
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,051
What do you got?

165
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,525
We need six 4X4s...

166
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,221
Told you
I'd be back.

167
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:12,962
Heard you might
be thirsty.

168
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,429
I assume that bodes well
for the rescue.

169
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:20,434
Structural beam, high-compression
concrete. I can't break it up.

170
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,936
You can't get me
out of here?

171
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:23,702
No. Just means
we're gonna move on

172
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,403
to a different
piece of equipment.

173
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,571
I got airbags coming
in that'll lift 70 tons.

174
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,442
What's your name?

175
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,246
You testing
my mental state?

176
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,344
If I'm gonna be stuck
down here for a while,

177
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,048
I'd like somebody
to talk to.

178
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,147
Look, the guy
who just left

179
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,055
is the one who's gonna be holding
your hand through all this.

180
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,388
You can talk to him.

181
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:42,851
Little pinch.

182
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,223
Ow! Ow!

183
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,599
Okay. Big pinch.

184
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,028
I got to call my husband.
Can I use your phone?

185
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,500
No bars down here.

186
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,367
<i>L'chaim.</i>

187
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:01,339
Where're you going?
Don't worry.

188
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,109
Fire Marshal Bill
will be back soon.

189
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,223
So, I hope I didn't weird
you out, giving you that gift.

190
00:13:17,496 --> 00:13:18,724
Can we talk
about this later?

191
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,958
Of course.

192
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,391
Is now later?

193
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,831
Maybe things aren't
going so well with Lucas?

194
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,703
If so, I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to step into anything.

195
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,039
There's no problems. We're
doing just great. Thank you.

196
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,706
So why the weirdness?

197
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,181
Can you help?

198
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,989
When I opened it, I didn't
think it was a housewarming gift,

199
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,787
I thought it was
an engagement present.

200
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,530
It just happened
last night.

201
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,471
No wonder you'd wanna
hide this from me,

202
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,063
since I'm such
a delicate flower.

203
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,270
I didn't know
what to say,

204
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,640
and I've been
slightly distracted.

205
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,539
That might make sense, except
you're not wearing the ring.

206
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:12,411
So you are hiding it,
which begs the question...

207
00:14:12,551 --> 00:14:14,917
House,
it's in my office drawer

208
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,046
because I knew
I was coming here.

209
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,253
It's not weird,
there's no mystery.

210
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,720
I'm just getting married.

211
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:26,895
Excuse me.

212
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,726
<i>How much longer?</i>

213
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:33,762
Less than a minute.
Are you in any pain?

214
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,774
<i>Nothing new.
Just a little claustrophobic.</i>

215
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,567
<i>Shouldn't you be taking
care of those other people?</i>

216
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,873
<i>The ones that I hurt?</i>

217
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,143
Everything
checks out okay.

218
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:54,517
My nose is bleeding.

219
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:58,257
It's expected, given the
trauma you've sustained.

220
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,462
That's not expected.

221
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,641
The way things fell,
this support beam

222
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,870
is now holding up
a giant pile of rubble.

223
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,743
We can't lift it without
jeopardizing everyone down here.

224
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,413
So it's time to
discuss amputation.

225
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,350
No.

226
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,589
Please listen to me. You've
been down here almost two hours.

227
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,930
By the time they
clear away the rubble...

228
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,023
We're not
cutting off her leg.

229
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,566
You don't have to rush to
this to make his job easier.

230
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:40,994
You kidding me?

231
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,131
We leave
the leg pinned,

232
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,731
we're risking
crush syndrome.

233
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:44,833
What's that?

234
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,969
Your leg isn't getting
enough circulation.

235
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,276
The longer it's pinned,
the more the muscle dies.

236
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,179
So what does that mean,
like a limp?

237
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,013
Dying muscles
release poisons.

238
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,449
We free your leg, the poisons
rush back into your system.

239
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,715
It could stop your heart.

240
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,019
So could cheeseburgers.

241
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,816
Just get your lazy friends
to start moving that pile.

242
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,153
She's got two more hours before
crush syndrome could possibly set in.

243
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:06,958
We're digging
up there by hand.

244
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,499
I can't guarantee
I can get 10 tons

245
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:09,932
of debris pulled
off in two hours.

246
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,333
Well, you need to try.

247
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,903
It's my leg.

248
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,064
It's not just crush syndrome
you got to worry about, okay?

249
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,703
There's gas leaks,
there's fire,

250
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,141
we can never rule out
secondary collapses,

251
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,803
no matter how much
we shore this thing up.

252
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,210
You think chopping off
someone's limb

253
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,306
inside a pile of
dirty rocks is safe?

254
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,010
Sepsis, fat embolism,
hemorrhage...

255
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,450
Those risks are
nothing compared

256
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,316
to the risk of this
thing coming down again.

257
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:33,154
Captain, he's a jerk, but
that's what the patient wants.

258
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,921
Can we please just give it
a couple more hours?

259
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:42,090
Yeah.

260
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,535
I got to get up
to triage.

261
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,666
Thank you, Doctor.

262
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,367
House.

263
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,875
You don't need to thank
me. It just makes sense.

264
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,181
Just promise me you won't
let them cut off my leg.

265
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,185
I promise.

266
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,416
Does that make
you feel better?

267
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,652
For some reason,
it does.

268
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,725
Your phone is
working down here.

269
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,234
Switched carriers, better
rollover minutes. Talk.

270
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,166
MRI was clean,
but afterwards

271
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,966
he started bleeding
out of his eyes and nose.

272
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:22,206
So there was something
wrong before the collapse.

273
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,902
Unless it's just conjunctive
coagulopathy from the trauma.

274
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,741
Yeah, yeah, you don't think
he was sick before, we get it.

275
00:17:27,813 --> 00:17:29,007
<i>You're wrong.</i>

276
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,241
Brain infection?

277
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,441
Sorry I'm late.

278
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,875
<i>Where were you?
Physical therapy.</i>

279
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,214
I left my phone
in my locker.

280
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,585
The infection causes
neurological symptoms,

281
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,487
goes systemic,
and DIC causes the bleed.

282
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,616
<i>Good theory.</i>

283
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:42,182
Except for the part
that there's no fever.

284
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,960
<i>Get an X-ray venogram.</i>

285
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,929
See if you can find a
reason for your existence.

286
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,322
<i>Also look for
venous sinus thrombosis.</i>

287
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,697
We would've
seen it on the MRI.

288
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:51,633
Not if you were too busy
not looking for it.

289
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,136
We should X-ray for
a facial fracture first,

290
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,571
this could all
be simple trauma.

291
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,006
Just do what I tell you.

292
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,173
<i>I'll be back
in 10 minutes.</i>

293
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:01,638
You're leaving?

294
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,647
There's a dozen people here
who can save you.

295
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,876
I'm apparently the only one
who can save this other guy.

296
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:08,878
Wait.

297
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,310
Don't go.

298
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,595
Hanna's freaking out.

299
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,768
She's having a panic
attack, she can't breathe,

300
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,030
she's gonna rip
out all her IVs.

301
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,230
So calm her down.

302
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:27,804
She wants you.

303
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,299
I'm flattered.
Give her oxygen.

304
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,839
They won't let O2 down
there, fear of explosion.

305
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:38,314
You have to go back.
She needs you, House.

306
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:00,197
You only came back because
I freaked out, right?

307
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:06,039
Not at all. I just realized
how big and scary the world is,

308
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:09,308
and how cozy and safe
this little place is.

309
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,519
Thank you.
I'm sorry I needed you.

310
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,761
Here.
Call your husband.

311
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,769
Charlie?

312
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:39,433
I'm here in...

313
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,771
They called you?

314
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:45,545
They're helping me.

315
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,109
Are you coming?

316
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,883
I don't know how
this could've happened.

317
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,691
It's your birthday.
I'm so sorry.

318
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,752
See, this is why
I lied about the phone.

319
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,094
Your BP is spiking, so you're
bleeding faster from your leg wound,

320
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,327
and we'll have less
time to save it. Hang up.

321
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,030
Okay. Okay, they're
telling me I have to go.

322
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,206
That was stupid of me.

323
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,473
It was nice.

324
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,049
I don't see that
as a contradiction.

325
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:23,377
He was already
on his way.

326
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,754
He was in Baltimore and
they all saw it on the news.

327
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,853
How many people
were hurt?

328
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,658
What did I tell you about not
raising your blood pressure?

329
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,763
Can I ask what's wrong
with your leg?

330
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,331
Crane fell on it.

331
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:43,633
Small world.

332
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,372
You could've
just said no.

333
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,214
I'll remember that
for my next human contact.

334
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,042
Would you pray
with me?

335
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,979
No.

336
00:20:58,223 --> 00:21:02,125
I'm not in the habit of encouraging
my patients' superstitions.

337
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,158
How's that a habit?

338
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,661
You plan on getting trapped
under a building again?

339
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,400
I don't believe in God.

340
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,261
I don't either.

341
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,568
Please.

342
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,583
I always thought

343
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,424
if I did the right thing,

344
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:38,920
if I treated people right,

345
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,595
then good things
would happen to me.

346
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:44,893
Do you think
that's how it works?

347
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,898
I didn't use to.

348
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:52,710
Then recently I tried.

349
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,642
Now I don't know.

350
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:05,421
Good news.

351
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,620
Advancing catheter
through interior jugular vein.

352
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,765
You told House
you were at therapy.

353
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,301
Did you transcribe
the entire meeting?

354
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,269
Entering
the cavernous sinus.

355
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,636
Your therapy's
on Thursdays.

356
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,932
It got rescheduled.
Injecting dye.

357
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,307
Really?

358
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,141
I'm not gonna rat you out,
we're friends.

359
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,983
I just wanna
make sure you're okay.

360
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,416
No filling defects.

361
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,025
Don't worry. I'm okay.

362
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,663
Do you think we could be
friends when I get out of here?

363
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,331
Yeah.

364
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,132
We'll catch a ball game or a
group sex show or something.

365
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,608
Put it in there.

366
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:05,647
Okay, when the beam starts
lifting, you're gonna feel pain.

367
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:08,647
It's gonna be like your foot's
gone to sleep times a billion.

368
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,588
You'll notice that I'm
waiting till now to tell you.

369
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,689
We're ready.

370
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,085
Lifting.

371
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,194
I'm feeling
the pain already.

372
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,660
That's good. Means the
pressure's coming off.

373
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,165
Closer to
getting out of here.

374
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,369
Come on.
Help me pull her out.

375
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,204
Come on.

376
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,305
It's moving!

377
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,482
Hanna!

378
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,214
Hanna!

379
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,818
What the hell
happened?

380
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,122
I think the adjacent beam
snapped during the lift.

381
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,957
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
We got a secondary collapse.

382
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,865
We're all right,
how are you guys?

383
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,631
<i>Rescue 1,
copy the mayday.</i>

384
00:24:32,704 --> 00:24:34,831
<i>Main tunnel looks fine.
Red Team is on the way.</i>

385
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:36,373
Lift this up.

386
00:24:37,442 --> 00:24:39,000
One, two...

387
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,479
The kit.
Give me the kit.

388
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:51,544
All right.

389
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,461
No breath sounds on the left
side. Tension pneumothorax.

390
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:58,293
Hey, Hanna.

391
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,297
One of your lungs
has collapsed.

392
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,992
I'm gonna have to
reinflate it, okay?

393
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,407
Hey, you better
get back up top,

394
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,179
make sure you didn't
nick an artery.

395
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,257
I'm gonna have to go.

396
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,192
It's okay.
You're all right.

397
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,833
You're lucky
this isn't worse.

398
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,566
You know
who's even luckier?

399
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,166
You and just about every other
human being who wasn't down there.

400
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,414
What did
the venogram say?

401
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,712
Clean. Now the guy is
starting to spike a fever.

402
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,581
Subarachnoid bleed.

403
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,910
Meningitis?

404
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,011
He didn't say
his neck was sore.

405
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,783
That's because
everything's sore.

406
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:02,156
He just took a 15-story swan
dive into concrete. Do an LP.

407
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,751
We also have to consider
other infections.

408
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:05,295
So you're suggesting
we do an LP?

409
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:06,625
I guess I am.

410
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,089
Genius.

411
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,823
Hey, bad news.

412
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,131
Because of the collapse, we
can't try the airbag again

413
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,864
until we get
everything off the top.

414
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,032
Be five,
six hours, at least.

415
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,332
Then we have to amputate. No.

416
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,503
It's been
four hours already.

417
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,013
It used to be a long
shot, now it's crazy.

418
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,242
Crush syndrome is basically
a build up of potassium.

419
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,648
If we remove potassium...

420
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,618
We're already treating
with sodium bicarbonate.

421
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,655
Not with glucose
and insulin.

422
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,088
We got glucose in the kit, there's
got to be a diabetic here somewhere.

423
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,126
You want to dose
the insulin here?

424
00:26:35,193 --> 00:26:37,354
In a non-hospital setting?
That is insane.

425
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,829
It's not worth it.
Really?

426
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:41,829
Because I think
I'm the only one here

427
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,162
who knows what
a leg is worth.

428
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,835
And fortunately, you're not
the one who's in charge, he is.

429
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:47,762
And he knows that
I'd testify against him

430
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,431
if Hanna sues for
cutting off a leg

431
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,236
without exhausting
every option.

432
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,170
Give us a minute?

433
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,241
I know you're angry,

434
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:02,412
but please don't put her life
at risk just to get back at me.

435
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:05,454
Really? Wow.

436
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,357
So this is
all about you now?

437
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,292
You took her side
against me

438
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:12,023
right after you heard
about my engagement.

439
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,191
Yeah, that must be it. It's not
that you're a pathetic narcissist.

440
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:16,699
I don't love you.

441
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:21,094
So just accept it and
move on with your life

442
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,730
instead of making
everyone miserable.

443
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:23,933
That's great.

444
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,102
A life lesson from a
middle-aged single mom

445
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,474
who's dating
a man-child.

446
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:29,643
Screw you.

447
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:32,112
I'm sick of making
excuses for you.

448
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,419
I'm sick of other people
having to tiptoe around you

449
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,681
and make their
own lives worse

450
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,986
while they try to
keep you from collapsing.

451
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:42,750
I'm done.

452
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,893
Fantastic. Just stay
away from my patient.

453
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,098
What are you
clinging to, House?

454
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,328
You're gonna risk her life
just to save her leg?

455
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,237
It really worked out
well for you, didn't it?

456
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,738
What do you have in your
life? Honestly, tell me.

457
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,113
I'm moving on.
Wilson is moving on.

458
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,412
And you? You've got
nothing, House. Nothing.

459
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,583
I'm going down there,

460
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,646
and I'm gonna convince her
to let me cut her leg off.

461
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,891
If you have any decency
left, you'll stay out of it.

462
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:25,326
No.

463
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,600
Dr. House promised.

464
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:31,234
If there was
any other way...

465
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,777
It doesn't hurt right now. I can wait.

466
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:38,706
Dr. House,

467
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:40,982
tell her.

468
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,849
Hanna,

469
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,889
we have to
amputate your leg.

470
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:55,425
No. You said that
there was time.

471
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,798
There was.
And it's run out.

472
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:01,831
No.

473
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,342
You asked me how
I had hurt my leg.

474
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:10,213
I had a blood clot,
and the muscle was dying.

475
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,217
And I had all these doctors
telling me I should amputate.

476
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:15,149
And I said no.
And they did this

477
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,285
very risky operation.

478
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,950
I almost died.

479
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,184
But you saved your leg.

480
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,329
I wish I hadn't.

481
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,627
They cut out a chunk of muscle
about the size of my fist.

482
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:33,831
They left me with this
mutilated, useless thing.

483
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,073
And I'm in pain
every day.

484
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,572
And it changed me.

485
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:45,474
It made me
a harder person.

486
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,717
A worse person.

487
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,485
And now...

488
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,679
Now I'm alone.

489
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,025
You don't wanna
be like me.

490
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,399
You got a husband
who loves you.

491
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,133
You have friends,
you can start a family.

492
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,466
You have a life.

493
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,141
And this is just a leg.

494
00:30:34,966 --> 00:30:36,126
Okay.

495
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:49,237
I got it.

496
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,985
I can't put you out 'cause it could
depress your respiration too much.

497
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,460
This should take away
some of the pain.

498
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,530
Will it be quick?

499
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:19,376
I'll use the scalpel to slice
through the skin, muscle and fat.

500
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,811
That should go
pretty fast.

501
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,213
Then I'll switch over to the
electric saw when I get to the bone.

502
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:28,418
It's two bones about as
thick as a broom stick,

503
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:31,114
and takes about as
long to get through.

504
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:34,488
I'm gonna cut as close
to the concrete as I can.

505
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,459
Save as much of
your limb as possible.

506
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,187
Then the orthopedic
surgeons

507
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:39,560
back at the hospital
will clean you up,

508
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,360
have you fitted
for a prosthetic.

509
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,660
You'll be running circles
around me in no time.

510
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,309
How bad will it hurt?

511
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,841
Like nothing
you've ever felt before.

512
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,922
Hanna.

513
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:54,056
Baby, I'm so sorry.

514
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,224
Shut up.
It's all right.

515
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,028
You always
loved my legs.

516
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:59,001
Baby, I don't care
about your legs.

517
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,594
Baby, I love you.

518
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:03,437
I love you.

519
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,235
What?

520
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:46,147
He's fallen into a coma.
LP was clean, but...

521
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,343
<i>What are his vitals?</i>

522
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,646
Excuse me, Officer.

523
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,947
What do you mean
"Officer"?

524
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,489
How long has there
been a cop there?

525
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,948
I don't know,
10 minutes.

526
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,084
He was being questioned
when he fell into the coma.

527
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,459
Was anything else making him nervous
or worried before his other symptoms?

528
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,225
He was claustrophobic
right before the bleed.

529
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,426
And before the fever,
we told him

530
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,093
that he probably
did fall asleep.

531
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,500
<i>It's his BP spiking.</i>

532
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:08,999
But that didn't cause
his first symptom.

533
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,008
Yeah, it did.
All the caffeine.

534
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:13,703
We thought the problem
was in his toilet,

535
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,109
and by that, of course,
I mean his head,

536
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,170
<i>which distracted us
from the fact that</i>

537
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,148
<i>it could've been just
a clog in his sewer pipe,</i>

538
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,549
<i>and by that, of course, I
mean his spinal cord and...</i>

539
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,680
Blah, blah, blah, blah.
You get the idea.

540
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,719
An arachnoid cyst on his lower
spine, that's why we missed it.

541
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,255
He's been sitting
10 hours a day,

542
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:29,883
spiked his
spinal fluid pressure.

543
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,326
Run a CT...

544
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,697
BP 72 over 42.

545
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:35,993
Hanna?

546
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,035
Hanna?
I can't breathe.

547
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,126
I can't breathe.

548
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,498
Breath sounds
bilaterally.

549
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,371
It's not
another pneumothorax.

550
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,874
Neck veins flat,
no tamponade.

551
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,344
Damn it.
I waited too long.

552
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,875
Hanna, you've got a clot in
your lungs. I'm gonna fix this.

553
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,545
IV streptokinase.

554
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,715
What's happening?
What's going on?

555
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,759
Her body won't get any oxygen
unless we can bust the clot.

556
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:03,919
This is a blood thinner.

557
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:09,559
Is she gonna
be all right?

558
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,727
It'll make her bleed more,
we'll take care of that next.

559
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,139
It's not
busting the clot.

560
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:21,807
Maybe it's the heart.

561
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,460
What?
It's not a clot.

562
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:46,496
It's a fat embolism
from the amputation.

563
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:53,439
Okay.
So what can we do?

564
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,338
Come on.

565
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,748
Do something. Please.
Please, do something.

566
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:03,810
Come on, guys, do something. Come on.

567
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,981
Please, come on,
do something.

568
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,718
Come on, do something!
Do something!

569
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,688
There's no way to
prevent a fat embolism.

570
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:45,955
Even if you'd done
this in an OR,

571
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,224
you couldn't
have saved her.

572
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:04,178
You can't blame yourself
for her death.

573
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,613
This wasn't your fault.

574
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,275
That's the point!

575
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:10,081
I did everything right.
She died anyway.

576
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:13,922
Why the hell did you think that
would make me feel any better?

577
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,665
You shouldn't be
alone right now.

578
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,868
You're bleeding.

579
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,841
I'm gonna give you a task,
as an employee.

580
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,707
Get out of my way.

581
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:02,671
What's that?

582
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:07,434
I'm asking
for some time off.

583
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,239
What's wrong?

584
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,486
Are you okay?

585
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:22,148
Obviously not.

586
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,510
You're gonna leap
across the room

587
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,775
and grab them
out of my hand?

588
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:29,510
No.

589
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,554
It's your choice if you
wanna go back on drugs.

590
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:36,318
Okay.

591
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:41,023
Just so you know, I'm finding
it hard to see the downside.

592
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,623
You need to rebandage
your shoulder.

593
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,632
Is that why you're here?
Foreman sent you?

594
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:52,633
No.

595
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,701
Here to yell
at me again?

596
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:55,802
No.

597
00:41:57,882 --> 00:42:00,180
Well, I'm running
out of ideas.

598
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,913
Lucas...

599
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,181
Oh, great.

600
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,449
You're feeling
uncomfortable again.

601
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:08,319
Probably means
you just got back

602
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,087
for some quickie
wedding in Vegas,

603
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,388
or you're
already pregnant...

604
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:12,759
I ended it.

605
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:17,091
What?

606
00:42:17,167 --> 00:42:18,794
I'm stuck, House.

607
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:22,865
I keep wanting
to move forward,

608
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:26,034
I keep wanting to
move on, and I can't.

609
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:28,405
I'm in my new house
with my new fiancé,

610
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,039
and all I can
think about is you.

611
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:37,610
I just need to know
if you and I can work.

612
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,988
You think
I can fix myself?

613
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,496
I don't know.

614
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,737
'Cause I am the most screwed
up person in the world.

615
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:54,998
I know.

616
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,907
I love you.

617
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,872
I wish I didn't.

618
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,013
But I can't help it.

619
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,846
How do I know
I'm not hallucinating?

620
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,617
Did you take
the Vicodin?

621
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:54,289
Nope.

622
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,491
Then I think
we're okay.

623
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:03,563
Yeah.
