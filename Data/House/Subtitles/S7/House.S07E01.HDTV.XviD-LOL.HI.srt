178
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:23,096
I hear they want
to tear down the Coliseum

179
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:24,731

180
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,067
The Buona Speranza
Medical Center in Rome

181
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,002

a Huntington's trial.

182

Seriously, I live to sing.

183
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:32,706
I know that they've been doing
fetal neural transplantation.

184
00:11:32,773 --> 00:11:34,140
I also know
that their subjects

185
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,409

of intracranial hemorrhage.

186

You go through my locker.

191

And then you decide
you want to round it off

192
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:48,955
by lecturing me
on my life choices?

193
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:51,191
I'm worried about you.

194
00:11:51,258 --> 00:11:53,560
Oh. Well, that makes it
all right then.

other people?

202
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:22,589
Well, last night
was emotional for you.

203

We both lost that patient.
We watched people die.

204
00:12:25,659 --> 00:12:28,261
I came back here
and I went for the Vicodin,

205
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:31,264

and you came here.

206
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:33,466
Which I don't regret.

207

I'm not saying you do.

208

Why do you have to
analyze things to death?

Why can't you just...
Let it be nice?

213

You're right.

214

216
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,895
Yeah.

217
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:04,197
The secret bath is...

218
00:13:04,265 --> 00:13:07,400
Burning my lady parts.

219
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:12,572
How do you think
my [Whispers] anus feels?

220
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,442
Burning means it's working.

221
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:17,177
Can we get out now?

222
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:19,012
I was so waiting
for you to say that.

223
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:24,647
Could I speak to
Dr. Jankowski?

224
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:28,351
No. I don't need
to disturb him in Bermuda.

225

Everything okay?

226
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:32,355
Dr. Cuddy's phone keeps going
directly to voicemail,

227
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:34,057
and I need to get
a Neurosurgeon

228
00:13:34,124 --> 00:13:35,792
to replace Dr. Richardson
for the day

229
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:37,226
or else she's screwed.

230
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:39,896
I'm a Neurosurgeon.

231

No. You're not.

232
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:43,900
I've cut into people's
heads more often--

233
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:45,635

in neurosurgery

236
00:13:48,539 --> 00:13:50,506
You've worked here two days.
How--

237
00:13:50,574 --> 00:13:52,575
Dr. Cuddy's first assignment
was for me to get to know

238
00:13:52,643 --> 00:13:54,777
everything about
Dr. House's team...

239
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:57,680
And not to believe anything
any of them told me.

240
00:13:57,748 --> 00:14:00,650
I'm...Not
a Neurosurgeon?

241
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,088
And...Voila!

242
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:06,656
The first course,

243
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:09,959
I flaked some tender
young ears of corn

244
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:13,629
on the side of assorted
exotic breakfast meats

245
00:14:13,697 --> 00:14:15,998
in a Chile sauce reduction.

246
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,134
And the...
Second course?

247
00:14:18,202 --> 00:14:21,204
A single grape.
To cleanse the palate.

248
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:25,108
Which is kind of a waste,
'cause there is no third course.

249
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:28,311
I'm glad we stayed in.

250
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:30,313
This is actually...
Pretty good.

251
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:32,915
I can always tell
when you lie.

252
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:36,886
I mean <i>always.</i>

253
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:40,623
I slept with
my freshman roommate.

254
00:14:40,691 --> 00:14:42,058
A lie.
A truth.

255
00:14:42,126 --> 00:14:43,960
You have a tell.
What is it?

256
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:45,995
First admit
that you were lying.

257
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:48,564
Fine. I was lying.

258
00:14:48,632 --> 00:14:50,967
My sexual history
is boring and predictable.

What is my tell?
Are you kidding?

260
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:54,771
If I tell you your tell,
you'll get rid of it,

261
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:56,072
then I won't be able
to tell.

262
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,874
Well, then you have to
tell me something

263
00:14:57,941 --> 00:14:59,308
I don't already know
about you.

264
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,511
Even though, technically,
you didn't tell me something

265
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:03,045
that I didn't already
know about you.

266
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:05,782

as sleeping beauty on Halloween.

take that picture?

no Neurosurgeon on the premises.

That's so cool!
So was I.

400
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:40,809
You were hiding me
from him.

401

Why?

402
00:20:43,046 --> 00:20:45,113
I was not hiding you.

403
00:20:45,181 --> 00:20:48,383
I was protecting
your privacy.

404
00:20:48,451 --> 00:20:51,086
Wasn't sure if you were
ready to go public

"Us" thing yet.

406
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,526
Why would I be
doing all this

private?

Maybe you're not ready yet.

411
00:21:22,852 --> 00:21:25,187
Have you read the list
of side effects on those drugs?

412
00:21:25,254 --> 00:21:26,588
We could crash his BP.

413

I haven't heard a thump,

414
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:29,958
so I assume he's still
quietly puking.

415
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,727
We could be
making him worse.

the hospital better.

We can test for whatever
you want to test him for

419

once he's stable enough
to get back to the hospital.

00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:48,458
You just said so.

534
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,493
Chase is running labs.

535
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:52,228
Right now the top two
contenders are hepatitis

536
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:53,830
and peptic ulcer disease.

537
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:57,767
So...Is today really
your last day?

538
00:26:57,835 --> 00:27:00,102
Flying out tomorrow.

539
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,405
How long a leave
are you taking?

540
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:04,006
Depends.

541
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:05,274
On the drug trial.
Sounds risky.

542
00:27:05,342 --> 00:27:06,375
Yadda, yadda.

543
00:27:06,443 --> 00:27:07,543
You don't think
I should do it.

544
00:27:07,611 --> 00:27:08,578
Message heard.

545
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,146
No. I approve.

546
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:12,548
Living fast
and dying young is crap.

547
00:27:12,616 --> 00:27:15,218
If you have a chance
to get better...

548
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:18,020
I say good for you.

549
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:22,859
I brought Wilson in here
specifically to go public,

550
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:25,495
just like you requested.

551
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:26,896
I pressured you.

552
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:30,533
Wilson coming through
the window pressured you.

553
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:33,736
If you're forced into this,
it's not gonna work.

554
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:40,076
Do you have any response
to that?

555
00:27:41,945 --> 00:27:44,714
[Objects banging]

556
00:27:44,781 --> 00:27:47,617
Game on.

557
00:27:47,684 --> 00:27:49,485
Is he better?
Yep.

558
00:27:49,553 --> 00:27:51,621
You're lying to me
again, aren't you?

559
00:27:51,688 --> 00:27:52,989
Yep.
Then we're screwed.

560
00:27:53,056 --> 00:27:54,123
Don't we have
to tell--

561
00:27:54,191 --> 00:27:55,591
oh! Damn.

562
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:58,194
Dr. Richardson's
prepping for surgery.

563
00:27:58,262 --> 00:28:00,429
Yeah. I need to talk
to him.

564
00:28:00,497 --> 00:28:02,698
He's prepping for surgery.
So you said.

565
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,268
I just need to confirm
he is who you say he is

566
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:08,070
and that he's
a licensed Neurosurgeon.

567
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:09,739
Well,
here's his paperwork.

568
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:11,173
His hospital I.D.'s
right there.

569
00:28:11,241 --> 00:28:13,075
You can...See it's him.

570
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:14,911
Yeah. I should
still talk to him.

571
00:28:14,978 --> 00:28:16,779
They've already scrubbed.
He'd have to be re-sterilized.

572
00:28:16,847 --> 00:28:18,915
The patient's anesthesia
would have to be adjusted.

573
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:21,617
Why did you report
he wasn't here?

574
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:26,489
I must have...
Misunderstood.

575
00:28:35,065 --> 00:28:36,832
(Richardson)
Oh...Why...

576
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,434
Why...

577
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:39,936
Why is it so...
So hot in there?

578
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:41,337
Oh!

579
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,407
Ahh.

580
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:47,343
La-dee-dah.

581
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:50,479
Woodstock, baby.

582
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:51,914
Is he stoned?

583
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:54,417
No. We're pretty
sure he's got--

584
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,385
oh, I'm sure you have
an explanation,

585
00:28:56,453 --> 00:28:57,620
but I don't care.

586
00:28:57,688 --> 00:28:59,989
See, you need to have
a doctor on the premises

587
00:29:00,057 --> 00:29:02,058
who can actually do
neurosurgery.

588
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,794
Tell the attending
to divert all ambulances away

589
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:06,295
and start calling
other hospitals

590
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:09,398
and see who can take
your stabilized ICU patients.

591
00:29:09,466 --> 00:29:11,167
Those departments
are shutting down.

592
00:29:14,237 --> 00:29:16,205
"Design" for five points.
Got it.

593
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:18,975
"Hear."
Got it.
Both versions.

594
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:22,478
"Love."

595
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:24,080
You didn't see love.

596
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:26,015
Wow. I didn't think
you'd take

597
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:28,951
my lack of board game skills
so personally.

598
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:30,820
[Drops pen]

599
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:33,089
Why didn't you tell me
you loved me?

600
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:34,724
Didn't a wise woman
once say--

601
00:29:34,791 --> 00:29:37,026
and by once,
I mean two hours ago--

602
00:29:37,094 --> 00:29:38,928
"why do you have to analyze
everything to death?

603
00:29:38,996 --> 00:29:40,696
Why can't this
just be nice?"

604
00:29:40,764 --> 00:29:42,131
I told you I loved you.

605
00:29:42,199 --> 00:29:43,899
You didn't tell me
you loved me back.

606
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:47,436
You don't think that should
give me cause for concern?

607
00:29:47,504 --> 00:29:48,771
No. 'Cause words
don't matter.

608
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,107
Actions matter.

609
00:29:51,174 --> 00:29:53,542
You're really gonna
take a stand here.

610
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,744
You can't say--
nope.

611
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:56,579
Why?

612
00:29:56,647 --> 00:29:58,014
Because...

613
00:29:58,081 --> 00:30:00,316
I forgot to grab a "v."

614
00:30:06,089 --> 00:30:08,057
Lobe.

615
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,692
Gets you one point.

616
00:30:11,428 --> 00:30:13,896
One.

617
00:30:28,938 --> 00:30:30,939
Labs show he's negative
for everything.

618
00:30:31,007 --> 00:30:33,341
I'm guessing at least
one of them is wrong.

619
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:34,910
Who cares?
The E.R. and the ICU

620
00:30:34,977 --> 00:30:37,179
are half-empty and the place
is crawling with suits.

621
00:30:37,246 --> 00:30:38,413
It's over.

622
00:30:38,481 --> 00:30:40,048
You do know we still have
a sick patient here.

623
00:30:40,116 --> 00:30:41,750
<i>Right?</i>
<i>He's the guy sitting</i>

624
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:45,053
right behind you,
taking off his clothes again.

625
00:30:45,121 --> 00:30:47,222
Uh, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

626
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,490
Uh, why don't you
just sit down

627
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:50,158
and take it easy?

628
00:30:50,226 --> 00:30:51,827
He should be coming down
by now.

629
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:54,329
And yet...I'm not.

630
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:56,131
<i>What if his behavior</i>

631
00:30:56,199 --> 00:30:58,700
isn't a side effect
of the ondansetron?

632
00:30:58,768 --> 00:31:00,802
<i>What if it's a symptom?</i>
Thank you.

633
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,971
<i>What causes delirium</i>
<i>and nausea?</i>

634
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,474
<i>(Taub)</i>
<i>He's been stuck here</i>
<i>in the hospital a few days.</i>

635
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:07,242
Nobody else is sick,
so it can't be environmental.

636
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,877
Not exactly stuck.
I snuck out.

637
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,647
Freedom is my birthright.

638
00:31:12,715 --> 00:31:14,950
Where did you go?

639
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:17,052
The Seafood Festival at the Convention Center.
<i>We're screwed.</i>

640
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,754
Seafood Festival has stuff
from all around the world

641
00:31:19,822 --> 00:31:21,356
<i>in combinations</i>
<i>nobody every thought of.</i>

642
00:31:21,424 --> 00:31:23,024
<i>We could be here</i>
<i>all year.</i>

643
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:24,559
You had shrimp?
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

644
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:25,794
<i>And crab?</i>
<i>Lobster?</i>
Uh-huh.

645
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:27,496
<i>Uh-huh.</i>
And...

646
00:31:27,563 --> 00:31:30,699
I ate whatever
looked good.

647
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,968
Did you eat any roe?

648
00:31:33,035 --> 00:31:35,137
<i>Little tiny eggs?</i>
Nummy!

649
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:38,607
Toad eggs will cause nausea,
and they can get you high.

650
00:31:38,674 --> 00:31:41,209
<i>If I'm right,</i>
<i>the antidote is fast-acting.</i>

651
00:31:41,277 --> 00:31:43,178
If we can get him to keep
his clothes on long enough,

652
00:31:43,246 --> 00:31:46,681
he can pass
as a functioning Neurosurgeon.

653
00:31:48,484 --> 00:31:49,918
[Keys clicking]

654
00:31:49,986 --> 00:31:52,387
Um...

655
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:53,421
France.

656
00:31:53,489 --> 00:31:55,223
And not Paris or the Rivera,

657
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:57,192
but there's this place
in Normandy.

658
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,261
It's on a...
A tidal island.

659
00:31:59,328 --> 00:32:01,463
Everyone who's not staying
in one of the small inns

660
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:03,465
has to leave
before the tide comes in.

661
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:08,203
You have this 900-year-old
fortress all to yourself.

662
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:10,906
It's called...

663
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:13,642
Mont Saint-Michel?

664
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:15,710
That's it.
Have you been there?

665
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:19,014
Nope. But I got a pretty
good idea what it looks like.

666
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:21,183
H-how did you know?

667
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,051
You used to have a picture
of it as a screensaver.

668
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,686
That was years ago.

669
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:26,988
I guess
it's a memorable place.

670
00:32:27,056 --> 00:32:29,424
Now, unfortunately, we can't
fly straight to normandy,

671
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:32,194
but the layover in London's
only a couple of hours.

672
00:32:32,261 --> 00:32:33,361
What are you talking
about?

673
00:32:33,429 --> 00:32:35,297
It's all there.

674
00:32:35,364 --> 00:32:36,765
All you gotta do
is click confirm,

675
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:37,933
and we're eating croissant

676
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,235
and being insulted
by stinky people

677
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:42,003
this time tomorrow.

678
00:32:42,071 --> 00:32:44,573
Don't worry.
I used Wilson's credit card.

679
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,874
I can't.

680
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:47,943
I'm kidding.

681
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,278
I used your credit card.

682
00:32:50,346 --> 00:32:52,380
House...

683
00:32:52,448 --> 00:32:53,848
The hospital
does not need your body.

684
00:32:53,916 --> 00:32:55,483
I do.
So does my daughter.

685
00:32:55,551 --> 00:32:56,885
Well,
she can come too.

686
00:32:56,953 --> 00:32:59,688
Or to grandmother's house
she can go.

687
00:32:59,755 --> 00:33:02,757
[Laughs]
This is crazy.

688
00:33:05,094 --> 00:33:08,763
So...You break off
your engagement,

689
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:11,199
but you won't adjust
your schedule.

690
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,538
I can't.

691
00:33:16,606 --> 00:33:19,407
Not...Tomorrow.

692
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:23,078
But...Two weekends
from now.

693
00:33:23,145 --> 00:33:25,347
If Rachel's gonna
stay with my mom,

694
00:33:25,414 --> 00:33:29,384
I'm gonna need a little
bit of prep time.

695
00:33:29,452 --> 00:33:30,619
Okay.

696
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:38,693
What if it doesn't work?

697
00:33:38,761 --> 00:33:39,961
What if I stay this way
forever?

698
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:41,663
The antidote works quickly.
If we're right,

699
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:43,598
you should be back
to your old self in no time.

700
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,133
My old self was boring.

701
00:33:45,201 --> 00:33:46,601
<i>Can't we keep the new self?</i>

702
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:48,570
Just lay down,
and stop unbuttoning.

703
00:33:51,574 --> 00:33:53,808
I'm sorry
that I read your note

704
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,877
and looked in your locker.

705
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:59,080
You get used to that
kind of thing around here.

706
00:33:59,148 --> 00:34:01,416
Do you have anyone going
with you to Rome?

707
00:34:01,484 --> 00:34:02,851
Is that your

how you must feel.

713
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,229

733

You can't just...
Say that and shut up.

734
00:35:27,468 --> 00:35:29,302
It's just
a statement of fact.

735
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,672
It's not
a debatable proposition.

736
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:36,443
Right. Because you can
see the future.

737
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,845
No. But I can see
the past.

738
00:35:38,913 --> 00:35:40,313
And you're gonna remember

739
00:35:40,381 --> 00:35:43,083
all the horrible things
I've done,

740
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,784
and you're gonna
try to convince yourself

741
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:46,419
that I've changed.

742
00:35:46,487 --> 00:35:48,688
And I'm gonna start doing
those horrible things again,

743
00:35:48,756 --> 00:35:51,157
because I haven't changed.

744
00:35:51,225 --> 00:35:53,793
Then you'll realize that...

745
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:01,201
I'm an insane choice
for someone who has a kid.

746
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:02,802
And from there,

747
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,738
it's a short step
to the inevitable conclusion

748
00:36:04,805 --> 00:36:08,541
that all of this...

749
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:10,543

756

I'm sorry that we met

I hope you restore our rating

and tell me how you treat

765
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:55,922
Uh, I-I-I would watch

Speaking of which...

777
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:22,582
Earlier today
I asked you about...

778
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,350
Having sex.

779
00:37:24,418 --> 00:37:25,685
You gave me a look

780
00:37:25,753 --> 00:37:28,454
that almost certainly
could only mean no.

781
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:31,591
However, on the other hand,
I'd be remiss if I...

782
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:34,594
Didn't follow up
and confirm.

783
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:36,729
See? It's the same look.

784
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,565
So if it didn't mean no
the first time,

785
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:40,033
then...
No.

786
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,768
No. No, no.

787
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:43,336
No.
Okay.

788
00:37:43,404 --> 00:37:44,604
No pressure.

789
00:37:44,672 --> 00:37:46,840

ever work?
