all Godfather on you.

I wouldn't lie to you

188
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,849
Well, you don't get to lie
to me about anything.

189

my life like that.

Well, maybe you should practice,
'cause it comes in handy.

191
00:10:25,246 --> 00:10:26,830

Hemorrhagic-type smallpox.

216

No. It's just
a regular rash.

224

It's not even a side.
It's a fictional construction.

No, we have

I think a better one.

And once I gain access,
I run the T.B. test.

348
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:09,781
You could have said
all that in there.

349
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,616
In front of the narc?
As if.

350
00:17:11,684 --> 00:17:13,518
Are you so afraid
of this new girl,

351
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:15,053
we have to take
elaborate measures

352
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,172
every time you want to skirt
around ethical boundaries?

353
00:17:17,256 --> 00:17:19,457
Elaborate measures?
We took a walk--

354
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,676
a walk you
would have taken anyway.

355
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:24,396
Actually, I saved you
from the horrible

traffic jam.

358
00:17:31,988 --> 00:17:33,521
We believe the rash
under Julie's armpit

359
00:17:33,606 --> 00:17:36,024
is actually
petechial spots.

360
00:17:36,092 --> 00:17:37,692
When added to the high fever,
the vomiting--

361
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,361
there haven't been
any seizures, no stiff neck.

362
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:41,446
If I could just gain access
to the patient,

363
00:17:41,497 --> 00:17:42,814
I can investigate
the rash further.

364
00:17:42,865 --> 00:17:44,115
I'll take a look.

365
00:17:44,183 --> 00:17:45,734

necessary precaution.

the dad's new symptoms

385
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:41,338

with them having smallpox.

00:18:43,524 --> 00:18:44,891
He does have a headache.

388
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,660
No. He just said, "ow,"
and held his head.

<i>(Foreman)</i>
<i>Actually, he said, "ow."</i>

390
00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:49,796
Then he said,
"it's a headache."

391
00:18:49,864 --> 00:18:52,048
Which could be indicative
of head pain.

<i>Headache is caused by muscle</i>

such events as a bleed
in the brain from T.B.

not gonna approve
of us moving the patient.

399
00:19:09,434 --> 00:19:12,102
Chase, can I talk to you
outside for a second?

400
00:19:16,874 --> 00:19:18,358
You just tried this.

401
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:20,527
I'm not a better liar than Foreman.
Sure, you are.

520
00:25:16,888 --> 00:25:19,523
Did I just dream the part

521
00:25:19,591 --> 00:25:22,092
where I finally agreed
it was smallpox?

522
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,195
<i>Well, if what I thought</i>
<i>was reality</i>

523
00:25:24,262 --> 00:25:26,997
was actually a dream,
then the reverse...

524
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:28,232
Oh, my God.

525
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:31,952
I had a threesome
with Beyonce and Lady Gaga.

526
00:25:32,037 --> 00:25:34,572
She doesn't have pustules
on her palms

527
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:36,690
or the soles
of her feet.

528
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:40,611
The dad
does have pustules there.

529
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,631
So how does he get smallpox,
but it skips her?

530
00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:56,810
If I leave like that,
you should follow.

531
00:25:56,895 --> 00:25:58,095
Oh.

532
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:02,867
We gave it to him.

533
00:26:02,934 --> 00:26:04,434
Where's Chase?

534
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:06,904
You do realize we don't
all live together, right?

535
00:26:06,955 --> 00:26:08,939
Well, then just--
we gave it to him.

536
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:12,243
No pustules
on the daughter's palms, so...

537
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:13,777
<i>(Taub)</i>
<i>So therefore</i>
<i>your theory is</i>

538
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:15,379
you asked me to take
the dad's blood,

539
00:26:15,447 --> 00:26:17,047
but I accidentally
injected him

540
00:26:17,115 --> 00:26:18,832
with smallpox.

541
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,834
Exactly, although technically,
it was the vaccinia virus,

542
00:26:20,902 --> 00:26:23,620
<i>which is what the smallpox</i>
<i>vaccine is made from.</i>

543
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:25,455
<i>Same symptoms as smallpox,</i>

544
00:26:25,507 --> 00:26:27,691
but only half the calories and
almost none of the lethality.

545
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,510
You sound like one
of those anti-vaccine cranks.

546
00:26:29,578 --> 00:26:30,895
You can't develop
full-blown symptoms

547
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:32,196
from the vaccine
this quickly.

548
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:35,132
You can if you're
immunocompromised.

549
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,017
Am I the only one
who reads these things?

550
00:26:37,102 --> 00:26:39,770
Dad had kidney cancer.
Six years ago.

551
00:26:39,821 --> 00:26:41,689
He's been in remission.
Well, it's obviously back.

552
00:26:41,773 --> 00:26:43,473
Shot his immune system,

553
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:45,309
made him vulnerable
to the vaccinia,

554
00:26:45,377 --> 00:26:47,144
which will get better
on interferon.

555
00:26:47,212 --> 00:26:49,446
So if he responds
to the treatment,

556
00:26:49,514 --> 00:26:51,448
that proves
he doesn't have smallpox.

557
00:26:51,516 --> 00:26:52,833
Then what does
the daughter have?

558
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:55,452
Damn. I was hoping
you weren't gonna ask me that.

559
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,288
Can we please just focus

560
00:26:57,339 --> 00:27:02,159
on the disease we just diagnosed
and can treat?

561
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,844
What's more likely--
he got smallpox

562
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:05,713
the day after
we immunized him for it,

563
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:07,664
or he's sick
from the vaccine itself?

564
00:27:07,716 --> 00:27:09,767
You got any proof
the kidney cancer is back?

565
00:27:09,834 --> 00:27:11,168
Well, let me give him this.

566
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:13,721
When he gets better,
that'll be the proof you need.

567
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:15,439
I'll put on one
of your fancy spacesuits,

568
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:17,191
and I promise I won't kiss him
on an open sore.

569
00:27:17,275 --> 00:27:19,643
You know
who Janet Parker is?

570
00:27:19,694 --> 00:27:21,845
In 1978,

571
00:27:21,896 --> 00:27:24,365
she was working
at a university in England.

572
00:27:24,449 --> 00:27:27,484
Someone in a research lab
on the floor below screwed up.

573
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:31,355
Some smallpox virus managed
to float up through the vents

574
00:27:31,406 --> 00:27:34,158
into the room
where she was working.

575
00:27:34,209 --> 00:27:37,194
She died
four days later--

576
00:27:37,262 --> 00:27:39,229
<i>the last known person</i>
<i>to die from smallpox.</i>

577
00:27:39,297 --> 00:27:41,548
And the person
in charge of the lab

578
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:45,252
was so destroyed,
he killed himself.

579
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:48,339
Now that he's shedding,

580
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,924
I can't open that door
for anyone.

581
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:55,062
Hey!

582
00:27:55,146 --> 00:27:56,981
Look, there's
the proof you need.

583
00:27:57,048 --> 00:27:59,516
There's blood
in the urine bag.

584
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:00,934
His kidneys
are shutting down.

585
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:02,569
He's in the final stages
of the disease.

586
00:28:02,654 --> 00:28:04,571
If smallpox was causing
the kidney failure,

587
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:05,906
the blood would be brown.

588
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:07,941
It's red because
the kidney cancer is back,

589
00:28:08,026 --> 00:28:10,444
and this is not smallpox.

590
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:13,897
I'm not opening
that door.

We'll give you

00:36:26,514 --> 00:36:28,565

We have to assume.

713
00:36:40,028 --> 00:36:42,279
There's another isolation room
on the fifth floor.

714
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:44,665
The problem is getting him
from here to there.

715
00:36:44,732 --> 00:36:45,983
So it's inconvenient.

My having

I'm sorry.

719
00:36:58,663 --> 00:37:00,330
We don't know
that he'll catch it.

720
00:37:00,415 --> 00:37:02,466
We don't know that
it's definitely smallpox,

721

not until we get the DNA results
back from the CDC.

722

What do you think
the dad just died of?

723
00:37:06,955 --> 00:37:08,972
Would it kill us
to talk it through?

724
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,124

[Chuckles]
Gerritt is the Captain's kitty.

<i>(Taub)</i>

Hunting mice and rats?
For the crew.

746
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:56,336
The hold was probably
infested with mice.

00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:58,055
What if that's
the difference?

748
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:01,608

What happened to Gerritt?

749

Ah.

Is that a sad "ah"
or a cute "ah"?

751
00:38:05,847 --> 00:38:08,382
Gerritt, he died.
It's a sad "ah."

752
00:38:10,818 --> 00:38:14,187
Before he died,
did he lose his fur?

753
00:38:16,758 --> 00:38:18,025
How did you know?

754
00:38:19,911 --> 00:38:20,977
Mice don't carry smallpox,

755
00:38:21,045 --> 00:38:23,046
but they do carry
rickettsialpox.

756
00:38:23,114 --> 00:38:24,881
Which is treatable.

757
00:38:27,585 --> 00:38:29,803
Just start them
on doxycycline.

758
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:32,055
Based on a bald cat?
You never heard of shedding?

759

What's the downside?

760
00:38:33,541 --> 00:38:35,926
If we shove her full of
antibiotics plus the antivirals,

761
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,310

her bone marrow.

She probably is,

764
00:38:40,314 --> 00:38:42,899
and I don't want to risk
pushing her over the edge.

765
00:38:42,984 --> 00:38:44,484
At least look
at the dad's body.

766
00:38:44,552 --> 00:38:47,738
Small patches of black, dead
tissue will prove I'm right.

Eschars appear
with rickettsialpox
