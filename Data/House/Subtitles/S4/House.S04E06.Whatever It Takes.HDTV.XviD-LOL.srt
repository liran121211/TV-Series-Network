1
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:18,280
and nine-time national champion Tony Cooper

2
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,350
- How do you feel?
- Great.

3
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,920
****

4
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,540
your****

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,280
You sure you don't wanna go to law school?

6
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,590
I hate lawyers.

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,940
And so do I, go get him baby

8
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,410
Ready to go.

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,230
Let's hear it,folks!

10
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,670
And it's casey alfonso by
less than half a car length!

11
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,880
What a spectacular finish
for the young phenom.

12
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,070
Casey alfonso with an amazing finish.

13
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,210
What'd you do at the end there?

14
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,710
Yeah,heh...

15
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:45,910
At about 250 feet,the car got out of
shape a bit.But about halfway down...

16
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,310
I just got into the zone or something.

17
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,320
I pedaled it back into the groove.It
was the coolest ride of my life!

18
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,740
How does it feel to beat
nine-time national champion

19
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,330
tony cooper?

20
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,410
I'm sorry.Can you repeat that?

21
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,890
How does it feel to
beat nine-time national

22
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,950
champion tony cooper?

23
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,220
Casey!Casey! Casey!

24
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,110
Out of the way!Out of the way.Casey!

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,690
Casey! Get the
ambulance! Brian, get the ambulance!

26
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:15,960
Casey...

Whatever it takes</font>

30
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,950
68-year-old
male,non-smoker.

31
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,530
Ah,68's a good run.

32
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,950
That'll leave something in
the lockbox for the rest of us.

33
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,270
- Next!
- That's your breakfast?

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,980
Technically,it's Wilson's lunch.

35
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,950
- 20-month-old baby,persistent
rash,fever... - Too much crying.

36
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,910
- Female college student with...
- Too much drama.

37
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,850
You don't care about
the crying or the drama.

38
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,180
'cause you won't see the patient.

39
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,070
And you'd treat methuselah if
his snot had an interesting color.

40
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,010
It means you've already decided
which case you wanna take next.

41
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,180
Tell me about speed racer.

42
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,200
Female,seizure with visual and
auditory processing deficiency.

43
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,820
- I did a consult and
- What kind of race car?

44
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,290
Dragster.

45
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,200
- Continue.
- You're gonna take a case based on the car she drives?

46
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,090
Nothing says "thanks for saving my life"

47
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,990
like a test drive in a car that
accelerates faster than the space shuttle.

48
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,460
You can't save her
life,'cause she's not dying.

49
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,370
Her lab shows signs of dehydration.

50
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,480
That means the problem's
just likely...Heatstroke.

51
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,630
Kinda hard to get
heat-struck in 41/2 seconds.

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,310
Not when you're wearing a
three-layer fireproof suit.

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,300
Excuse me.

54
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,450
Dr. House?

55
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,390
No,lazy ass called in sick
again.We can give him a message.

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,160
May we talk in private?

57
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,870
So...either it's heatstroke,

58
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,890
in which case we take the afternoon off,

59
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:20,920
or it's one of the diagnoses that you
guys are gonna have for me in two minutes.

60
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,490
- You're in charge.
- I know.

61
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,160
- Cop?
- He's not packing.

62
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,980
Your dad's either a
cop or a security guard.

63
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,020
Or she carries a weapon.

64
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,600
You're with the CIA?

65
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,720
One of our employees just
returned from an assignment sick.

66
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,630
We believe he may be the victim
of an assassination attempt.

67
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,310
Sure.You wanna close the door?

68
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,980
Door?

69
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,080
Well,I assume you're gonna drop
trou at some point during the dance.

70
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,340
- I don't see why I should share.
- This isn't a joke.

71
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,970
If you're willing to help
us,we need to leave now.

72
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,900
If I have to walk somewhere,there
better be at least five girls involved.

73
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,090
And they better be working
their way through college.

74
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,730
Okay,what do you got?

75
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,060
Hereditary brain
disorder,transient ischemia,

76
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,620
or paraneoplastic syndrome.

77
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,310
None of those go away with
iv fluids.It's heatstroke.

78
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,250
Or cushing's or calcium deficiency.

79
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,810
- Who's your friend?
- We use the term "life partner."

80
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,570
Get a fresh history,neurological
exam,and an mri of her head.

81
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,150
15 minutes for the lap dance,a half
hour to scrub the guilt off my soul.

82
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,430
See you in 45.

83
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,770
Dr. House...We need to hurry.

84
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,820
Yeah,we need to hurry.

85
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,580
Little advice, I mean,obviously the village
people played out the whole cop thing.

86
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,090
But,come on,CIA?

87
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,670
Do you seriously expect
anyone to believe that?

88
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,530
It helps when you have props.

89
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,160
Keep your eye on my pen.

90
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,410
Very good.

91
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,680
Any nausea or vomiting
before the seizure?

92
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:16,010
no.

93
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,960
My dad had some,but he's
always like that before a race.

94
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,100
It could have been food poisoning.

95
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,950
- You two eat breakfast together?
- no.

96
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,700
Any history of sciatica
or spinal injury?

97
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,360
no.

98
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,650
Abnormal deep tendon reflex.

99
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,810
Really?

100
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,970
Let me see.

101
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,780
- It's there.
- I didn't say it wasn't there.I said it was abnormal.

102
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,450
We're gonna give you an mri to be sure,

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,930
but I'm guessing your symptoms were
caused by just dehydration and the heat.

104
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,430
You're guessing?

105
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,370
Look,I make a living
driving 300 miles an hour,

106
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,060
which makes the ability to stay
conscious kind of important.

107
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,640
I'm sure it's just heatstroke.

108
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,350
But we're gonna do an
mri to be extra careful.

109
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,080
you said you left your
cell in your office.

110
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,880
I lied.

111
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,730
I wasn't going to take it,

112
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,540
just tell you to turn
it off for takeoff.

113
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,690
I know...just wanted to see if
you could tell that I was lying.

114
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,260
Useful information.

115
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,140
- Yeah?
- Where are you?

116
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,960
I'm on a top-secret
mission for the CIA.

117
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,300
Right.There was nothing on
your racecar driver's ct,

118
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,180
and the history and
physical were normal.

119
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,640
Her deep tendon reflexes
seemed a bit weak to me.

120
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,890
Areflexia could mean miller fisher.

121
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,140
Yes,areflexia could mean miller fisher,

122
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,490
but since the reflex
was weak,not absent,

123
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,970
it doesn't mean
anything.I'm releasing her.

124
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,620
- You can go back to your poker game.
- Poker's illegal.

125
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,380
CIA would never allow illegal activity.

126
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,490
Have you considered miller fisher?

127
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,360
Why? What happened?

128
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,220
She just had another seizure.

129
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,790
And now she's getting
a vertical nystagmus.

130
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,920
We think it's miller fisher,

131
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,610
an inflammatory process.

132
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,290
In rare cases,it can cause
respiratory failure,but...

133
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,050
Wait,she could stop breathing?

134
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,550
You said there was nothing
wrong.You said you were sure.

135
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,490
You just had another
seizure.Clearly,there's something wrong.

136
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,240
So why should I trust you
to figure out what it is?

137
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,550
Where's Dr. House?I'm
at this hospital bec...

138
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,950
It's gonna be all right.

139
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,010
We just need to start
the plasmapheresis.

140
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,220
no!

141
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,580
It's not going to be all right,

142
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,150
because you obviously don't
have a clue what you're doing.

143
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,490
I'm not letting you touch me.

144
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,250
- Honey,come on.
- I wanna see House!

145
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,100
Where is he?

146
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,730
Looks a lot better on24.

147
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,910
I take that back.

148
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,250
Dr. Samira terzi.

149
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:13,150
It's a pleasure to meet you,dr. House.

150
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:15,620
We really appreciate the
consult on such short notice.

151
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,630
There's nothing that gives me more
pleasure than helping out a colleague.

152
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,680
This is Dr. Sidney curtis
from the mayo clinic.

153
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,810
He's also agreed to
help with the diagnosis.

154
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,110
- Dr. House.
- curtis on immunology sidney curtis?

155
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,230
Oh,you've read it?

156
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,380
Nope! But it is keeping my piano level.

157
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:33,838
"Cutthroat Bitch"

158
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,550
So...where is the poor,sick fella?

159
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,890
- What do we do?
- I don't know yet.

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,830
- She needs treatment.
- This is a test,right?

161
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,810
You're reporting back
to him everything we do.

162
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,090
Yeah.And I asked the
patient to be uncooperative.

163
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,130
Personally,I think she overplayed it.

164
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,970
She's being uncooperative because
you made us all look like idiots.

165
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,960
We're only gonna look like idiots
if we can't figure out how to get her

166
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,360
to agree to the treatment.

167
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,340
What would House do right now?

168
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,080
Pop a pill,insult
us,and trick the patient.

169
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,940
We can do that last part.

170
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,420
She's never met House
before,has she?Who's got a cane?

171
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,130
House isn't here.

172
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,030
We're not gonna act like him.

173
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,250
What do you want?

174
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,840
I,uh...

175
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,190
I'm gonna do what doctors
aren't supposed to do:

176
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,080
admit I made a mistake.

177
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,940
I shouldn't have been so
quick to dismiss your symptoms.

178
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,760
But you need to let us
start the plasmapheresis.

179
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,050
What do you want?

180
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,720
Case?

181
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,350
Honey,do you know where you are?

182
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,080
She's burning up.

183
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,480
- Start the treatment.
- We can't.

184
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,640
- You've got my permission.She's obviously confused.
- It doesn't matter anymore.

185
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,200
Miller fisher doesn't
cause delirium and fever.

186
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,210
I don't know what this is.

187
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,550
I'm afraid there are going to be some
limitations on his medical history.

188
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,010
Just let me know what you need,and
I should be able to provide it.

189
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,960
Fyi,my malpractice insurance
doesn't cover alien autopsies.

190
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,820
That's fine. X- files are the next wing over.

191
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,880
Where was the patient
when he first felt ill?

192
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,100
Sorry,that's classified.

193
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:15,750
But assume there aren't too many
places in the world john hasn't been.

194
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,150
And,yes,john's a cover name.

195
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,130
And what makes you think it
was an attempt on his life?

196
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,580
Sorry,can't tell you that either.

197
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,030
What can you tell us?

198
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,170
did oswald really have
sex with marilyn monroe?

199
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,390
Good lord.

200
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,640
Very professional.

201
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,530
Five days ago,he was 185 pounds.

202
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,480
Perfect health.

203
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,580
Cool.

204
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,160
Fever and delirium rule out...

205
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,200
Uh,he's not gonna hire you just
because you call him the most.

206
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,170
Especially since it's obvious
he doesn't wanna be called.

207
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,960
Symptoms rule out miller
fisher.M.s. Fits better.

208
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,070
Progression's too
fast.More likely meningitis.

209
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,600
Areflexia doesn't fit as well with...

210
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,880
- Does with amyloidosis.
- That's even slower than m.s.It's lupus.

211
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,590
I'm with the little man on this one.

212
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,410
It's attacking the body and
the brain.Classic autoimmune.

213
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,050
Flirt all you want,but
I should warn you:

214
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,560
shiksas are for practice.

215
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,300
Lupus this aggressive
wouldn't spare her kidneys.

216
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,890
It's primarily neurological.

217
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,320
- Let's start her on
- Why no plaques on her mri?

218
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,750
Mri was inconclusive.

219
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,440
- So I don't know
- So now you're sure that it's m.s.

220
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,520
Just like you were sure it was miller fisher
an hour after you were sure it was heatstroke.

221
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,380
The symptoms fit.Start
her on interferon.

222
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,890
We're not gonna score any points with House
if we solve this just by running your errands.

223
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,880
- I get that you want to be right.
- You don't?

224
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,580
I'm just trying to save a
patient,not score points with my boss.

225
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,590
Would it hurt the patient
if you let us run some tests?

226
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,580
You've got three hours.

227
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,670
We've run six complete tox screens,

228
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,260
tested for every heavy metal,poison,and
biological agent we can think of.

229
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,060
It says here he ate a lot of chestnuts.

230
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,250
Hold on a second.

231
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,450
If the squirrel liberation
army's involved,I'm outta here.

232
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,160
- Those little rodents are
- Horse chestnuts are poisonous.

233
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,900
- If someone switched them
- Horse chestnuts may look like chestnuts,

234
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:32,590
but they taste like a
horse's lower-than-chestnuts.

235
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,440
Which makes the theory that he accidentally ate
a couple of hundred slightly less persuasive.

236
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,600
And seeing as how he was prowling
the back alleys of...tehran?

237
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,340
It wasn't tehran.It was..

238
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,350
oops.You almost got me.

239
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,010
Unless we know the local
environmental factors...

240
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,560
- Poisonous flora
- You know I can't tell you that.

241
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,810
Well,then,why are we here?You
might as well just google "poison."

242
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,740
All they would tell me is...

243
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,380
He spent the last 11 months in bolivia.

244
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,710
Who you gonna kill in bolivia?

245
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,870
- My old Housekeeper?
- We don't kill people.

246
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,370
I'm sorry.Who are you gonna marginalize?

247
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,970
If it is my Housekeeper,she
has it coming.

248
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,190
Cleaning the windows means cleaning
both sides.Am I right,or am I right?

249
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,570
What does it matter what he was doing?

250
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,520
- The guy's dying.
- Not anymore.

251
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,850
I know what's poisoning him.And who.

252
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,680
John.

253
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,020
It's just pancreatitis.

254
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,400
He's not an alcoholic.

255
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,630
And unless his pancreas
is in his fingers...

256
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,600
Spies can't get fungal infections?

257
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,660
- And the burns on his skin?
- Spies can't get sunburns?

258
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,130
Bolivia doesn't have sun?

259
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,380
So,either we go with his theory
of the non-drinking drunk,

260
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,450
or he was poisoned by some group with the
resources to make it completely untraceable.

261
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,270
Some customized isotope.

262
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,460
Let's treat for radiation poisoning.

263
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,190
The iodine's to protect your thyroid.

264
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,370
Antibiotics are to handle infections.

265
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,480
Should start working
in a couple of hours.

266
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,040
We should celebrate...

267
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,400
With a beer.Or eight.

268
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,530
I don't drink.

269
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,930
Oh...me thinks he doth protest too much.

270
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,100
He's deathly ill.Why would
he lie about drinking?

271
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,130
Guilt over killing a man.

272
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,120
Make anyone hit the sauce.

273
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,660
- We don't kill people.
- Right.

274
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,840
You just lie to your friends and family,

275
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,270
establish false identies,trick
people into betraying their country.

276
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,810
He'd never cover up his
drinking-- he's too honest.

277
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,660
Hey. Something I've
always wanted to know.

278
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,620
That poison lipstick that
ginger used to kiss gilligan...

279
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,320
Why didn't that kill her?

280
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,950
Okay,drum roll.

281
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,590
Lp is negative for meningitis.

282
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,400
Sorry,cole.

283
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,670
Fat pad biopsy is...

284
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,820
Oh,wait for it...

285
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,530
Negative for amyloidosis.And
thirteen goes down.

286
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,720
- Could we hurry this up?My son has
- Can I have a kid too?I'm working too hard.

287
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,730
I could hook you up.

288
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,690
If I had two minutes and some
anti-nausea meds,i'd take you up on that.

289
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,600
And for the gold...

290
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,050
Protein 65,glucose 70.

291
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,970
It's m.s.Start her on interferon.

292
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,260
Turn to the last page Sed rate's
95.A.n.a.'s weakly positive.

293
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,260
- Positive? It's lupus.
- Weakly.Not lupus,it's m.s.

294
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,370
We obviously don't know
what it is.Treat for both.

295
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,220
No. I gave in on the test.

296
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,730
I'm not treating her for two
completely separate diseases

297
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,840
because you think lupus
will win you a prize.

298
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,260
- Still think it's lupus?
- Yeah.

299
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,270
Me too.

300
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,800
In case of emergency,go
to the emergency room.

301
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,630
Could be lupus.That's what we figured.

302
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,200
- Then why are you here?
- You're an immunologist.We wanted to confirm

303
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,960
Who are you looking for me to
help you sell down the river?

304
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,280
House or cuddy?

305
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,970
Foreman.

306
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
- Sorry.
- He's pushing m.s.

307
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,330
Thinks that because he's in charge,he has
to prove he's the smartest guy in the room.

308
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,460
All I've heard about you: you put
the patient above everything else.

309
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:11,390
That's why everyone
finds you so annoying.

310
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,000
All House cares about is results.

311
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,680
I know. I'm talking about
how to do deal with Foreman.

312
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,880
So am i.

313
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,160
Fever's down to 101.5.

314
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,390
Treatment's working.Why are we out here?

315
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,170
Trying to figure out
which treatment's working.

316
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:29,960
It's kind of tacky doing
it in front of the patient.

317
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,810
You put her on steroids too?

318
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,900
We had no choice...The
sed rate pointed to lupus.

319
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,210
And the a.n.a.Ruled it out!

320
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,690
Doctors!

321
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,400
Legs hurt?

322
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,430
I can't feel them at all.I
don't think I can move them.

323
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,630
Vitals stabilizing.

324
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,000
Tummy ache's gone as well.

325
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,840
So the treatment's working.

326
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,820
Wanna ditch Dr. Killjoy
and...hop in the company jet?

327
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:12,910
Little trip down mexico way.

328
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,930
And I'm not talking about
the country or the plane.

329
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,920
Do you think acting like an idiot
and talking about sex works on girls?

330
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:23,460
Well,if it didn't,the human race
would have died out long ago.

331
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,450
You're pretty cheery for
someone who was just proved wrong

332
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,160
about his pancreatitis theory.

333
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,550
I'm appropriately cheery for
someone who's being proved right.

334
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,920
John hasn't vomited in six hours.

335
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,310
What's to vomit?I'm eating his lunch.

336
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:37,440
Withholding nutrients is the
treatment for pancreatitis.

337
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,420
That and the antibiotics you put him on.

338
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,450
I did unhook your iodine,though.

339
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:45,610
Didn't seem to fit with the whole
I'm-just-jerking- You-guys-around gestalt.

340
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,890
You're unbelievable.

341
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,410
Well,let's ask john if he'd rather
be sick honestly or cured dishonestly.

342
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,230
John.

343
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,960
John.

344
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,210
Any chance he's just...

345
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,260
Overwhelmed with gratitude?

346
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,070
Paralysis.

347
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,720
Uh...It's a new symptom?

348
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
Big white space on the
board where it would fit?

349
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,380
Nice,multicolored markers?

350
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,750
I'm not writing it because we
can't know if it's a real symptom.

351
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,940
When these two went rogue and
pumped her full of steroids--

352
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,900
Steroids don't cause paralysis.

353
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,830
She was also on interferon!

354
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,390
Giving her both probably
fried her immune system.

355
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,960
Who knows what infection
you could cause--

356
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,510
We consulted an immunologist.

357
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,200
- She said we have
- She?

358
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,510
You talking about dr. Cameron?

359
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,630
- She thought lupus was
- She tell you to start treating?

360
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,750
Yes,they've ignored you.They screwed up.

361
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,780
And it's fun watching you spank them.

362
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,230
But can we get back to the medicine?

363
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,380
The last thing any of you give
a damn about is the medicine!

364
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,330
Look...

365
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,270
I'm not saying you're
bad doctors or bad people.

366
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,910
But House is.

367
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,430
He created a nasty
little cutthroat world,

368
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,860
planted you in it,and
is watching you play.

369
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:15,610
And none of it works
for anyone except him.

370
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,420
And whoever wins.

371
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,180
Given its quick progression,we
gotta assume botulism.

372
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,600
I'll go to her place,check
out her fridge and pantry.

373
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,090
It's not botulism.It's polio.

374
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,530
Brilliant.We should search her home
for fdr's remains or a time machine.

375
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,110
She could have contracted it from
anyone who's been to africa or...

376
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,700
She's been vaccinated.

377
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,710
Vaccines wear off.

378
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,830
There hasn't been a single
american case in over 20 years.

379
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,570
I've seen this disease.

380
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,720
- I know what it looks like.
- That's why you're finding it

381
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,240
Because you're looking for it.

382
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,210
Polio...it's crazy.

383
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,450
House wouldn't think so.

384
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,730
So go find House and
tell him your theory.

385
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,900
Take a personal day.Seriously.

386
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,570
Get outta here.

387
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,570
You don't have the power to fire me.

388
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,620
But I do have the power to
kick your ass off my case.

389
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,090
We're starting the botulism treatment.

390
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,630
The rest of you,look for confirmation.

391
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,030
- He should be brought up on charges.
- Okay,relax.

392
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,170
I'll take your book
out from under my piano.

393
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,610
He's dying of radiation sickness.

394
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,000
He's obviously in pain.

395
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,120
All of which could have been avoided
if you hadn't interfered with...

396
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,360
What was that for?!

397
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,940
Radiation sickness kills
specific cells at specific times.

398
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,660
His hair should be coming out in
clumps before he's writhing in pain.

399
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,620
Since it's not,I know
who's trying to kill him.

400
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,220
God.

401
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,230
It's blood cancer.Waldenstrom's.

402
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,830
Radiation can cause
infections,which set off--

403
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,170
If had any real evidence of foul play,

404
00:21:56,410 --> 00:22:01,110
you'd be torturing bolivians instead of putting
me into a state of anticipatory sexual arousal.

405
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:03,980
- Can we treat for both?
- Bad idea.

406
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,990
Unless you're the one
who's trying to poison him.

407
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,620
I'll arrange for
plasmapheresis and chemo.

408
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,640
Are you gonna trust
him after what he did?

409
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,310
I don't have to trust
him to agree with him.

410
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,390
You make a good point.

411
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,290
I've been wrong every time,and
she still won't listen to you.

412
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,000
So either she really likes
me or she really hates you.

413
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,880
And I got a ride in the jet.

414
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,050
Oh. Hi.

415
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,170
- What are you doing here?
- Just came to say hi.

416
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,550
Hi again.

417
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,670
Where's...mrs. Bearman?

418
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,490
- Sent her home.
- I was scheduling her for an mra.

419
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,400
If we gave mras to every
patient with a headache--

420
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,840
This wasn't just a headache,it
was the worst in her life.

421
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,540
Then lucky for you I'm a neurologist.

422
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,380
She went to a wine and cheese tasting.

423
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,720
- Both triggers for migraines.
- She's never had a migraine before.

424
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,600
And I never hagel before
the first time I had one.

425
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,880
Bagels don't kill people.

426
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,940
This is a classic
ticking-bomb aneurysm.

427
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,920
This taught me a lesson.

428
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,370
I guess when I mess with
other people's patients,

429
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,110
I risk looking like an officious bitch.

430
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,910
We're gonna have to
track down mrs. Bearman.

431
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,780
Wait...

432
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,160
Never mind.

433
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:27,910
- That's funny.
- It's not funny.It's totally immature.

434
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,190
It is funny.You just can't appreciate
it because you're the victim.

435
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,900
Yeah,I deserve shame and
ridicule for offering a consult.

436
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,590
Unheard of for a doctor.

437
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,740
You didn't offer a medical consult.

438
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,790
- You offered a "dealing with Foreman" consult.
- For the good of the patient.

439
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,520
It's what House would have done.

440
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,350
Maybe House will hear about
it and tear up with pride.

441
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,170
You think I'm trying to impress him.

442
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,940
I think that,for someone
who's not involved in his team,

443
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,450
you're remarkably involved in his team.

444
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,580
Let it go.

445
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,740
Let him go.

446
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,540
And that's mature?

447
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,350
120 over 80.Let 'er rip.

448
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,270
Now we got the medical
stuff out of the way.

449
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,220
Why don't we meet back at your place

450
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,690
for some enhanced
interrogation techniques?

451
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,960
My safe word
is,"help,please,please stop."

452
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,370
It's two pleases.

453
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,870
Anything less than that,you keep going.

454
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,470
You actually cure this guy,i'll
show you my private water board.

455
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,770
We need to consult an
oncologist about the chemo.

456
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,040
Oh,I'm sorry,I thought...

457
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,730
You were still euphemizing.

458
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:47,290
My valet knows a little oncology.

459
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,140
I was wondering when you'd
grow bored of avoiding my calls.

460
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,000
Oh,I can never grow
bored of ignoring you.

461
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,270
What's the latest
protocol on waldenstrom's?

462
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,080
- Where are you?
- CIA headquarters

463
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,310
How much
fludarabine--

464
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,860
Either you're sprawled
naked on your floor

465
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,900
with an empty bottle of
vicodin,or collapsed naked

466
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,620
in front of your computer
with an empty bottle of viagra.

467
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,940
Please tell me which,because
chase has another pool going.

468
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,030
They flew me in to help
deal with a sick employee.

469
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,790
- How much
- Hallucinations.Damn!

470
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,310
I shouldn't have bet on the viagra.

471
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:20,200
Okay,call the langley
switchboard,ask for extension...

472
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,980
- 3578.
- 3578.

473
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,820
He asked an awful lot
of questions for a valet.

474
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:30,480
You know,I happen to have a
position available on my penis.

475
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,030
Wait a second-- I think
I screwed up that joke.

476
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,530
You offering me a job?

477
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,160
I'd settle for that.

478
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,820
As tempting as a
position on your staff is,

479
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,700
- I like it here.
- Pays better.

480
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,560
And we've only had one
assassination attempt.

481
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,230
And I'm sure you're a great boss.

482
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,330
That's why your fellows left
en masse a couple of months ago.

483
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:56,360
I have satellite images.

484
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,460
Inspector gadget.

485
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,400
My god.You're actually at the CIA.

486
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,710
You've gotta get down here.

487
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,340
They've got a satellite aimed
directly into cuddy's vagina.

488
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,460
I told them the chances of
invasion are slim to none,

489
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,650
waldenstrom's.

490
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,780
Recommended dose is 25
milligrams per meter squared.

491
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,970
They do a background check on you?

492
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,420
25 milligrams?

493
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,590
They did a background check on you,

494
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,290
they did a background
check on your friends.

495
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,260
Relax.

496
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,250
I'm sure they already know that you
brought heroin back from afghanistan.

497
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,810
That...that's not true.I've
never been to afghanistan.

498
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,470
House?

499
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,580
- She's getting worse?
- Fever's risen slightly.

500
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,790
But it's definitely,um...

501
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,450
What...botulism?

502
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:53,520
Right?Because if you're wrong again,

503
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:56,100
and you're treating her for
something she doesn't even have--

504
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,850
The antitoxin hasn't
had time to work yet.

505
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,840
I know it's hard,but try to be patient.

506
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,760
Excuse me.

507
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,150
I know you're pissed I interrupted,

508
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,060
but you're gonna be even
more pissed in a second.

509
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,820
You tested her without telling me?

510
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,580
Yeah. And I know,I'm
really,really sorry.

511
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:26,100
But...on the other hand,it's a positive.

512
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,290
She has polio.

513
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:34,650
Now what,boss?

514
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,290
Where's House?

515
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,240
He's blown off four hours of clinic.

516
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,460
He's consulting for the CIA.

517
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:52,560
Seriously.Call langley
and ask for extension 35...

518
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,710
3536?

519
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,540
There's definitely two threes.I
- I wrote it down.

520
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,920
- I have it somewhere.
- He's gonna make up twice his skipped hours in the clinic.

521
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,890
Okeydoke.

522
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,560
And for protecting him,you're
gonna make up twice that.

523
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:08,640
Why are you punishing me worse than him?

524
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,270
Because House never learns.You might.

525
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,590
How are you feeling?

526
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,660
Like crap.

527
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,380
Yeah,cancer can be that way.

528
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,330
My hair is falling out.

529
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:37,240
That the chemo?

530
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,580
No,it's too quick.

531
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,560
So what does it mean?

532
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,360
It means you don't have cancer.

533
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,170
Someone actually did try to kill you.

534
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,680
You're stubborn.

535
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,380
- You're arrogant!
- There's no need to yell.

536
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,300
You may have cost that man his life.

537
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,050
He's getting the radiation treatment.

538
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,470
24 hours too late!

539
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,780
I didn't yell at you when
I thought you were wrong.

540
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,460
- I wasn't wrong!
- This isn't productive.

541
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:18,350
There is no productive.It's too late.

542
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,420
Because of your
inexperience,your poor judgment.

543
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:24,640
And your failure to
recognize a reckless fool!

544
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,480
Cordyceps sinensis.

545
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:39,230
It's,uh...it's an herbal treatment derived
from a parasitic fungus,comes from caterpillars.

546
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Along with dimercaprol chelation,

547
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,460
it's been shown to mitigate bone
marrow damage from radiation poisoning.

548
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,690
In monkeys.

549
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,250
I'm sorry.I was stubborn and arrogant.

550
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,110
Self-recriminations won't help her.

551
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,310
Nothing's gonna help
her.She's got polio.

552
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,930
There's no cure,but
there are treatments.

553
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,460
- She's dying.
- Yeah.

554
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,220
Every death's a tragedy.

555
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,890
Funny how you weren't so depressed

556
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,110
when she just dying because
me and Amber screwed up.

557
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,500
And I'm also self-centered.Thanks
for clarifying.

558
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,590
Don't forget self-pitying.

559
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,840
Vitamin c.

560
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,980
Extremely high doses.It was experimental
treatment protocol in the '50s.

561
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,850
- And they haven't finished yet?
- They...lost funding.

562
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,750
That's because there's no logical
reason vitamin c would cure polio.

563
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,350
Well,someone thought there was.

564
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,940
Someone thought black people
made excellent farm implements.

565
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,500
I'm not talking about hurting anyone.

566
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,570
I just wanna force feed
her some orange juice.

567
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,870
You wanna throw in some
bacon and eggs as well?

568
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,700
If there's anything you learn today,

569
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,400
it's gotta be that you can be wrong.

570
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,830
John,can you hear me?

571
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,550
We're going to start you on
an experimental treatment.

572
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,020
Tea?

573
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,480
It's a chinese herb.

574
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,460
- Which has been effective in
- I'm dying,aren't i?

575
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,650
Probably.

576
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,950
We're gonna attempt an
experimental protocol.

577
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,880
- A new drug?
- An old one.Vitamin c.

578
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,330
Ultra-high doses have been shown to destroy
the polio virus and heal nerve damage.

579
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,860
She could regain use of her legs.

580
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,970
It's unlikely.

581
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,570
But we're gonna try.Don't give up.

582
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,810
Nausea's...

583
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,600
not as bad.

584
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:01,970
Radiation sickness has a latency period.

585
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,350
You'll get better before you get worse.

586
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,240
You wanna know what I
really did down there?

587
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,540
Only if it's interesting.

588
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,830
The women there...

589
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,440
During carnival they...

590
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,630
They do this dance.

591
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,440
They call it the devil dance.

592
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,350
Not interesting.

593
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,570
I spent all 40 days with this

594
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,580
attache to the minister of defense.

595
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,710
The most...

596
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:54,850
buttoned-down woman
you'd ever meet.You know?

597
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,690
'cept when she did this dance.

598
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:07,210
She agreed to tell me stuff...

599
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,850
Okay,we have half a good story there.

600
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,600
Karma.

601
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,590
Best way to rid yourself of that
guilt is to confess your sins.

602
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,690
This pain is...right.

603
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,170
It's comforting.

604
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,910
It makes me think
that...Somehow,it all makes sense.

605
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,440
What do you mean,40 days?

606
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,200
When they found out.

607
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,750
What she...told me.

608
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,100
Carnival in bolivia's only eight days.

609
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,710
You have any idea what
a chestnut looks like?

610
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,770
You idiot.

611
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,350
Who are you calling an idiot?

612
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,400
Whoever knew that john
was stationed in brazil,

613
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,080
- not bolivia.
- Brazil?

614
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,020
Well,then,I guess I'm
talking to you,idiot.

615
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,130
It's the same region.

616
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,140
It's the same parasite,same diseases.

617
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,360
But not the same language.

618
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,060
In bolivia,chestnuts are chestnuts.

619
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,560
Brazil,on the other
hand,hascastanhas-do-para,

620
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,940
literally,"chestnuts from para."

621
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:32,040
Because it would be stupid
for people from brazil

622
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,810
to call them brazil nuts!

623
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,480
So he ate brazil nuts.Big deal.

624
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,160
No,he ate a lot of brazil nuts.

625
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:40,460
Which is a big deal,because
they contain selenium.

626
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,480
Which,in high doses,causes fatigue,

627
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,000
vomiting,skin irritation,discharge
from the fingernail beds,

628
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,910
and hair loss.Any of
that sounding familiar?

629
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,860
Can you treat it?

630
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,610
We've already started.

631
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,050
Treatment's chelation,same
as for radiation sickness.

632
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,920
The only difference is it works
a lot better on nut poisoning.

633
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:04,330
So what's the problem?

634
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,640
You're an idiot.

635
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:22,400
Why is she shivering?

636
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,990
Low serum calcium is a side
effect of the treatment.

637
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:26,850
I can give her a calcium supplement.

638
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,350
My arm hurts.

639
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,780
Infusion rate has to remain
high for the treatment to work.

640
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,110
Is it working?

641
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,780
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

642
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,310
It hurts.

643
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,460
It's working.

644
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,870
This is fantastic.

645
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,450
There's a lot you can
learn in my fellowship.

646
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,740
A few new procedures I could teach you.

647
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,320
Course,we'd need a nurse to prep.

648
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,400
I know how to kill a man with my thumb.

649
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:04,820
Actually,I was just trying to
make another euphemism for sex.

650
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,960
- So was i.
- Oh,god.

651
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,410
How can you flirt with this idiot?

652
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,400
He lied to us again and again.

653
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,300
He broke
laws,ethical codes--

654
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,060
I was right.

655
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,970
That doesn't mean everything.

656
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:20,180
It means a lot.

657
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,650
Dr. Curtis.

658
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,140
Dr. House.

659
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,030
Appreciate your help.

660
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:42,920
- Hey.
- Hey.

661
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,710
When...

662
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,680
when you were dying,you
tried to infect me.

663
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,770
Because you knew i'd fight for you

664
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,400
if I thought I was dying too.

665
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,730
You bringing this up now so I'll
forgive you for messing with my patient?

666
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,720
I'm happy I changed jobs.

667
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,820
But I know I'll never
have that sort of...

668
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,960
- Excitement.
- You Miss people trying to kill you?

669
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,930
no.

670
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:25,670
I miss...people doing whatever
it takes to get the job done.

671
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,000
I guess that's why I'm
having trouble giving it up.

672
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,690
I shouldn't have helped
them mess with your patient.

673
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,020
They had to screw with me.

674
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,270
I've gotten everything wrong.

675
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,410
I don't believe it.

676
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,010
You're not...

677
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,000
Gonna get everything right.

678
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,870
But you're never gonna
get everything wrong.

679
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,740
Morning!

680
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,290
Uh,where have you
been the last two days?

681
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,440
- Overslept.
- We saved speed racer.

682
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,580
She had polio.

683
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,660
We cured it with vitamin c.

684
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,750
Yeah.

685
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,440
I cured depression
with tonic water once.

686
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,520
Actually,I think there
was some gin in it too.

687
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,880
150 grams over six hours.

688
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:37,890
- It worked.
- No,it didn't.

689
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,620
I told you you can't cure polio.

690
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:45,680
That means either she's not
cured or she never had it.

691
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,010
Since she's walking out of here...

692
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,130
I tested her blood from admittance.

693
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,720
no polio.

694
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,480
that means brennan
screwed up the lab tests.

695
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:55,130
or you screwed up your lab tests.

696
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,620
you must have.she got better.

697
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,590
so it's relapsing and remitting.

698
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,900
maybe...porphyria.

699
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:03,000
nah,that's a stretch.

700
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,350
if she had porphyria,you
would have seen purple urine.

701
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,310
you think it's more
likely he cured polio?

702
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,080
they believe it.

703
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,740
her symptoms fit perfectly.

704
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,510
and the alternative is
unbelievably convoluted.

705
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,650
some doctor would have
to poison her with valium

706
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,220
so it looks like
polio,then fake a lab test,

707
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,430
then give her vitamin
c and stop the poison

708
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,490
so she magically gets better.

709
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,500
actually...it is kind of doable,right?

710
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,870
so what do you think?

711
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,190
should we test her for thallium
before you contact stockholm?

712
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,360
you poisoned her?

713
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,070
the really shocking thing is that
Foreman was right about the heatstroke.

714
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,280
vitamin c cures polio.I've seen it.

715
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,240
yeah...in some bush clinic.

716
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,620
you need polio in a
place with a proper lab.

717
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,140
the only problem is that places
with proper labs don't have polio.

718
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,690
there is no money in finding cures

719
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,700
for diseases that only kill poor people.

720
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,290
this will make them do research.

721
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,670
and what do you care
if I faked a lab test

722
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,770
if it saves a few thousand lives?

723
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,810
I did what I had to do.

724
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,620
isn't that what you hired us for?

725
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,480
which is why I'm not gonna fire you.

726
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,770
you're gonna quit.

727
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,790
go on,get out of here.

728
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,990
so you're just gonna let him go?

729
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,350
absolutely.

730
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,010
I'm gonna let him get as far away
as possible before you call the cops.

731
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,220
guy's a nut job.

732
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,660
who the hell did I leave in charge?

733
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,470
- Foreman.
- there was a reason for that.

734
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,660
next time,listen to him.

735
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,060
where have you been?

736
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:15,280
- and don't say the CIA.
- okay.

737
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,320
by the way,one
of my employees--

738
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,140
either you're gonna have
to get someone from the CIA

739
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,840
to call and confirm your story,or
you're doing eight clinic hours

740
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,410
and Wilson is doing 16.

741
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,560
I was in the hamptons.

742
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,410
I was helping some rich hedge
fund jerk treat his son's sniffles.

743
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,360
fascinating as that sounds.

744
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:47,580
for your honesty,I
will forgiveyourhours.

745
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,910
thank you.

746
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,870
no!

747
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,300
the only thing less likely
than your helping the CIA

748
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,160
is your helping some
rich guy on long island.

749
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,860
you're doing your hours andWilson's.

750
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,820
I know how to kill a man with my thumb.

751
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,680
who doesn't?

752
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,870
- hi.
- Hi

753
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,080
I'm going to take you up on your offer.

754
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,270
yeah?

755
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,700
well,i,uh,I live a
couple miles from here.

756
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,710
that's not the offer I meant.

757
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,510
I gave notice today.

758
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,620
you said you were happy at the company.

759
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,060
I lied.doubt you'll hold it against me.

760
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,130
i'll see you at 9:00 on monday.
