1
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,120
It's cold.

2
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,960
Oh, good.Thank you.

3
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:31,440
There's a new girl at
the ice cream store.

4
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,720
She doesn't seem too fond
of buttoning her top button.

5
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,700
Let's go check her out.

9
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,990
what are we supposed to
be doing--it's almost 4:00.

10
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,580
You got somewhere to be?

11
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,490
We know he likes to manipulate
people.He's probably testing us.

12
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,610
To find out what?

13
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,360
How long we can look stupid for?

14
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,920
He said he'd be here by 3:00.
He's obviously not coming.

15
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,490
- I'm going home.
- nobody follow her.

16
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,830
She pied pipered nine people
right out of a job last week.

17
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Would you mind holding
my metaphor for a second?

18
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,800
New patient.37 year-old male.

19
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:37,110
Suffers from severe
ascending muscle weakness.

20
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,990
- Why are you late?
- To see who'd put up with it.

21
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,780
So if we left,we would have been fired?

22
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,890
I was gonna fire  whoever stuck
around.But since everyone stuck around...

23
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,460
28% curvature of the spine has
caused reduced lung capacity,

24
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,400
and has reduced bone mineral density.

25
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,350
patient has spinal muscular atrophy.

26
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,450
It's genetic,incurable.

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,350
This is not  a diagnostic mystery.

28
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,640
- You have just given state secrets to the enemy.
- What enemy?

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,880
New patient. New rules. Today you're
gonna split yourselves into two teams.

30
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,200
First to figure out what's
threatening to deprive the patient

31
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,530
of the 20 or so miserable
years he's got left with sma,

32
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,570
gets to keep their jobs. .

33
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,030
Take off your numbers.You look stupid.And
I think I know who you are by now.

34
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,890
Wait.How do you want us to split up?

35
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,480
Good question,overly
excited former foster kid.

36
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:28,820
There's ten of you. I'm thinking
six against six.No, wait.

37
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:33,250
- How about women versus men?
- Excellent suggestion,fat twin.

38
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,880
More interesting  than evens versus odds,less
interesting than shirts against skins.

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,220
If your sex organs
dangle,you're the confederates.

40
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,310
If your sex organs are aesthetically
pleasing,you're the yanks.

41
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,620
Dr. House... I'd like
to be on the men's team.

42
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,590
Do your sex organs
dangle, cutthroat bitch?

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,990
Not yet.

44
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,790
You've never hired more than
one female in your team before.

45
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,640
If you're going to purge  an entire
gender,it isn't going to be the danglers.

46
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,610
Sounds logical.

47
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,530
If you don't think about it
for more than three seconds.

48
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,140
But I just told you that if
the danglers lose, they're out.

49
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,840
So I can only assume,you're
hiding the real reason.

50
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,640
You don't think the women
will be aggressive enough,

51
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,700
or be good enough at
science,they'll be too emotional.

52
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,280
Can I switch teams?

53
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,470
- If the danglers are okay,I'm okay.
- We're not okay.

54
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,070
I get it.You don't like me because

55
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,760
- maybe I'm a little bit competitive.
- Manipulative.

56
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,660
Cutthroat bitch is your official title.

57
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,120
It's a game.U can either
play for fun or play to win.

58
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,200
If you want to win,you want cutthroat.

59
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,320
No, thank you.

60
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,800
First thing we have to do
is get inside his head.

61
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,160
It's not psychological.

62
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,390
I'm not talking about the
patient, I'm talking about House.

63
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,950
He's insane,but he's not irresponsible.

64
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,560
He wouldn't be playing  this game,if
the didn't already know the answer.

65
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,510
First thing we do is
gang bang the sucker.

66
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,320
There's five of us.We
can run dozens of tests.

67
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,510
We don't need a theory.We
just need brute force.

68
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,150
What about the assist dog?

69
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,370
Picks bacteria-infested things up
with its bacteria-infested mouth,

70
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,400
- hands them over to the guy and...
- ithe dog.It wouldn't be fair.

71
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,600
- To who?
- Whom? The men.

72
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,210
House knows I used to be a vet.

73
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,560
If the dog's the
answer,they'd be at a handicap.

74
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,910
What about the dog?

75
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,440
Assist dogs put
everything  in their mouth,

76
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,500
- money, door knobs.
- Great.

77
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,640
That's not what I said.Why
do you think a low sodium...

78
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,760
I don't

79
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,870
The patient took a trip to Thailand two weeks ago.

80
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,400
- Hey,write bigger And angle the board more so they can see it.
- This is wrong.

81
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,180
It's only wrong  Ty cheat f us And if
they cheat off us,They're wrong.

82
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,210
They're not cheating.One
of them is moving.

83
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,320
Hey,stop playing With your
sutures Or I'll have to redo them.

84
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,230
Why do you guys Keep a d cell
battery In a urine specimen cup?

85
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,260
Because we pulled it From
a patient's intestine.

86
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:40,680
Why would somebody Swallow a battery?

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,730
Why do you assume It was swallowed?

88
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,020
Bed five needs a bag
Of ringer's lactate.

89
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,520
It would have been worse
If he'd used a nine volt.

90
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,780
Who said it was a "he"?

91
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,930
False assumptions.You're good.You're
trying to get me To think like him.

92
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,090
And you're trying To kiss my
ass.Why are you talking to me?

93
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,460
Because House is turning
Patient care into a game.

94
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,700
It's dangerous... The patient's
gonna suffer,Maybe die.

95
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,570
Wow,You really need to shave.

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,700
See what I did there?

97
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,210
Whoa

98
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,920
Interesting.

99
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,560
Need a crash cart in here!

100
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,690
I didn't do it.

101
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:47,760
when a person faints,it's because They're
not getting Enough blood to their brain.

102
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,050
The act of falling Corrects the problem.

103
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,820
You faint again strapped Into that
power chair Where you can't fall...

104
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,200
You might not wake up.

105
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,000
killed by an assistive device.

106
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,720
At least my death Would be ironic.

107
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,340
I think when you Went to thailand You
picked up a thread worm Called strongyloides.

108
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,720
They usually go up Through your feet.

109
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,060
I didn't do a lot of
Walking on the beach.

110
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,010
But I assume You did have
someone Lay you down in the sand.

111
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,200
Bare back,bare legs.Increases
exposure Tenfold over bare feet.

112
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,640
Two pills.

113
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,830
You'll be all better.

114
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,170
Can I have some water For those,please?

115
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,020
- Hey,take a number.
- House didn't say anything About taking turns.

116
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,870
- What's she testing him for?
- Don't.

117
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,070
They'll spend all day obsessing over my idea
Instead of coming up With one of their own.

118
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,290
- And hey,i might be wrong.
- Seriously.

119
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,930
I'm worried that  if we don't know What
she's giving you There can be conflicts.

120
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,240
No,you're not.House told me
He's keeping track Of all that.

121
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:48,030
ten doctors.They should
be getting Ten cures.

122
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,880
We need blood,Hair,and stool.


123
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,870
You poop,and then You use the wooden

sticks To collect the fecal matter,


124
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,570
Then you rub it On the green box.

125
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,360
Hand it to my dog.only one of
those things  I can do on my own.

126
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,000
And the last couple of days,I
haven't been doing that.

127
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,860
Is it all right With you if
we...Carry you into the bathroom?

128
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,890
If you want me there,That's the
way You're gonna have to do it.

129
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,910
- Okay.Ready?
- Mm-hm.

130
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,140
One,two,three.

131
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,590
Can I get a little Head
support,please?Thank you.

132
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,130
Why are you here?

133
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,260
My offices are being used By my teams.

134
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,980
Teams?

135
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,030
Which means this is the only
Place where you can yell at me.

136
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,650
You have teams?

137
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,130
Two of them.I wanted to
deal With the yelling today,

138
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,560
Because I noticed What you were wearing,And
i wouldn't have to listen All that closely.

139
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,080
You can't make a competition
Out of patient care.

140
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:06,680
Without competition,We'd
still be Single-cell organisms.

141
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,310
- Can I go now?
- Not until After the yelling.

142
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,330
What's wrong with him?

143
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,580
I have seven Of the finest minds on
it.Along with three very special...

144
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,340
you wouldn't be doing
this,Unless you already knew...

145
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,650
uh-uh.I tell you,You
tell them.Game's over.

146
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,040
If you know,You are obligated to treat.

147
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,980
Well,then in that case,I don't know.

148
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,770
Why would a guy...

149
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,660
Voluntarily shove A metal
object Into an electrical socket?

150
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,030
I'm getting closer and
closer To knowing the answer.

151
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,500
What would happen If
i shut down this game?

152
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,540
I'd fire them all,Hire 40 new Fellowship
applicants,Start the game All over again.

153
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,550
You do know what's Wrong with him,right?

154
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,770
Oh,it'd be pretty irresponsible
If I didn't,Wouldn't it?

155
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,990
- antibiotics aren't working.
- legionella could explain  the lungs,the fever...

156
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,470
If she had legionella,She'd
have low sodium.

157
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,640
What can you tell me About her?

158
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,030
She likes body surfing.

159
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,490
Maybe picked up a virus
Swimming off jones beach.

160
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,110
But she doesn't even Have the energy
To finish her Crossword anymore.

161
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,620
- Her boyfriend said...
- That's it.

162
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,160
- What is?
- Blurry vision.

163
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,790
How do you get Blurry vision from...

164
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,530
You don't stop a daily ritual That
cures boredom Because you're bored.

165
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,730
She stopped doing Her crossword puzzle
Because she's having A hard time reading it.

166
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,680
what causes fever,boggy
lungs And blurry vision?

167
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,910
Fungal.

168
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,290
Aspergillus would explain The
pneumonia,which explains the fever.

169
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,990
Start her on amphotericin.

170
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,420
hey,guys?Great job.

171
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,630
If you're gonna try
To take yourself out,

172
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,610
Why choose electricity?You eat
a bullet,Jump off a building...

173
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,860
I love the team thing,By the way.

174
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:53,540
Bury yourself alive In cuddy's cleavage.

175
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:57,050
Teamwork,collaboration,All
for the greater good.

176
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,460
It could have been A suicidal
gesture,As opposed To an actual attempt.

177
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:08,140
Interestingly,The rain in spain Doesn't
actually fall In the plain all that much.

178
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,250
But who puts their internal Organs
on a skillet Just to get attention?

179
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,970
Go ask him.

180
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,550
That would be cheating.

181
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:23,480
- Got a diagnosis yet?
- Get out of here.

182
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,820
- Got a stool sample yet?
- How could you know?

183
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,070
Oh,i talked to a
nurse.Pretty brilliant,huh?

184
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:32,350
i give you a move  House will love,straight
from one Of his former fellows,

185
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,750
- And you let me join your team.
- you're too late.

186
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,970
We already have our diagnosis.

187
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,450
He's lying because He wants
you to go away.So do i.

188
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,970
How do we know you're
not A double agent?

189
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,920
to find out  what we're
thinking,Then go back to the women?

190
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,890
Because I don't care
What you're thinking.

191
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,960
You wanna know why I want to be
on your team?Because you're idiots.

192
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,720
if I can get the women  out
of the competition,I'm in.

193
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,210
And so are two of you.

194
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,390
So...what's the big move?

195
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,670
It's called xenodiagnosis.We
let this bugs bite you,

196
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,720
And then we test their
feces For parasites.

197
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,650
Why can't you Test my feces?

198
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,090
Because you've been Chugging milk
of magnesia For the past hour.

199
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,390
You have a lot going in
And nothing coming out.

200
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:24,220
testing the bugs' feces Is actually
more accurate Than testing yours.

201
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,450
Smaller haystack,Easier
to find the needle.

202
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:33,460
You okay?Get the bugs off.

203
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,980
- Get the bugs off him!
- Test isn't done.

204
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,490
He's choking!

205
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,940
patchy infiltrates  on the x-ray.

206
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,770
patient improved  with chest pt and
oxygen,consistent with aspiration.

207
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,030
So now we have Another
symptom to explain.

208
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,940
Why does his throat think
His lungs are his stomach?

209
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,670
And why are your throats Closing up?

210
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,450
Shouldn't we be In separate rooms?

211
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,270
You think I'm gonna run Two
differentials This time in the morning?

212
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,510
- Grumpy,you're first.
- I'm not grumpy.

213
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,170
Oh,why would I call
you that If you weren't?

214
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,130
It's an unusual Combination.

215
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,540
Unusual equals exotic,Equals foreign.

216
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,320
Has to be connected To
his trip to thailand.

217
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,870
You practice medicine overseas?

218
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,170
I was with doctors without
Borders for eight years.

219
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,460
- Ta da!
- It's in my file.

220
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,150
david blaine Hides the six of hearts
In a beer bottle,It's still impressive.

221
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,350
- you like exotic.Why are you here?
- I want this job.

222
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,430
- parents sick?
- No.

223
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,580
- I just...
- This is not the job you want.

224
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,570
This is the job In the zip
code you want.You engaged?

225
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,560
- Yes.
- Ta da!

226
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,230
am I not allowed to grow
up And change my priorities?

227
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,720
You're allowed to,People usually don't.

228
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,370
This is not a new symptom.Our
patient Has spinal muscular atrophy.

229
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,490
He has documented Trouble
swallowing.The choking's not new.

230
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,880
so it's nothing's
new.What caused the old?

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,360
Strongyloides worms
Explain the fainting.

232
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,160
- We already treated...
- So he's all better,Woman...Who...

233
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,950
- thirteen.
- Hasn't got any worse.

234
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,890
it's a pretty passive approach
For the daughter Of an alcoholic.

235
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,000
Wrong again.

236
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,750
we could stress  his
system.Put him on a tilt table.

237
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,090
if he stays conscious,means we
made The right diagnosis,And we win.

238
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,070
Then why haven't you?

239
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,870
Six against four.

240
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,220
One of the men's gonna have
To join the women's team.

241
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,410
On the other hand,One of the
men Isn't an actual doctor.

242
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,280
So,i guess it's pretty fair.

243
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,040
Men,you're in the penalty box.

244
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,500
Uh,who's not the doctor?

245
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,420
I'm glad you asked about that.

246
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:41,390
reason I'm penalizing
you Is time management.

247
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,310
In diagnostics,you're always
Working against the clock.

248
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,750
the women came up with a theory
and they treated the patient.

249
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,980
you guys just sat around  in a lab,hoping a
series of blind tests would give you a theory.

250
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,570
You wasted the patient's time.

251
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,640
Now I'm gonna waste yours.

252
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,550
Her gums are turning yellow.

253
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,970
Whatever it is,It's in her liver now.

254
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,760
Fungal fit perfectly.

255
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,290
We were wrong.

256
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,310
We're gonna keep being
wrong,Until we're right.

257
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
Or till she dies.

258
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,230
Yeah,that was very helpful.

259
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,100
Need a team to tell me We're mortals.

260
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,690
Look, I'm sorry.You're right.

261
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,230
It doesn't hurt to be reminded That
we're dealing With real stakes here.

262
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:25,210
Liver failure is a bad
thing,But it's also a clue.

263
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,560
What does it tell us?

264
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,630
I can't let you leave.I
think you're still suicidal.

265
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,620
I wasn't trying to off myself.

266
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:44,260
No,that's right.You were
just trying To kill a wall.

267
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,280
I check this box,And your next roommates
Are gonna be jesus And crazy mcloonybin.

268
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,520
That guy never had a chance.

269
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,390
It's gonna sound stupid.

270
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,340
Suddenly you're shy?

271
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,160
You pooped your pants In front of me.

272
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,700
It's one of the nasty
Side effects of dying.

273
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,690
Last saturday,i got In a car crash.

274
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,320
A drunk driver came over
The line and hit me head on.

275
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,330
It was like slow motion.

276
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:23,250
I saw these headlights,And...

277
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,750
I saw...

278
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:34,290
The paramedics said I was
technically dead For 97 seconds.

279
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,580
It was the best 97 seconds Of my life.

280
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:54,100
Okay,here's what happened.Your
oxygen-deprived brain was shutting down.

281
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,310
A flood of endorphins
And serotonin was released

282
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,910
And it's what gave you The visions.

283
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,040
no.Believe me.It wasn't chemicals.

284
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,460
I've done every
hallucinogenic  there is.

285
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,160
This was way bigger than that.

286
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,490
There's something out there.

287
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,730
Something more.

288
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,040
- Hey,can I have My knife back?
- No.

289
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,430
- Who the hell Isn't a doctor?
- House said we can't talk.

290
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,070
He meant we can't talk About the case.

291
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,150
House is just Jerking us around.

292
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,550
- It's what he does.
-You're not curious?

293
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,620
only one reason You wouldn't be curious.

294
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,890
We should talk about the case.

295
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,360
He's punishing us For wasting time.Maybe
we shouldn't be Wasting this time.

296
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,420
Close that door.You're
gonna get us all fired.

297
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,170
We need to find a link Between
fainting And trouble swallowing.

298
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,390
We need to know If it's
dysphagia Or full blown achalasia.

299
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,880
Paraganglioma.

300
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,710
How would a neoplastic growth
In his abdomen explain...

301
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,370
Not his abdomen,In his neck.A carotid
body tumor Causes trouble swallowing.

302
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,780
food presses against  the vagus
nerve,And causes the fainting.

303
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,660
So if this guy has cancer,We
get to keep our jobs?

304
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,950
If he's healthy,We're fired?

305
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,210
We need a ct to prove it.

306
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,240
we need the women not to figure
it out   while we're sitting here.

307
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,440
And does House's computer
Have a built-in microphone?

308
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,920
there is a potential  toxicity
In the experimental treatment.

309
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,560
I was never here.

310
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,280
Blood pressure's remaining
Stable through 60 degrees.

311
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,980
No pauses on his ekg,No nausea.

312
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,690
Our treatment worked.

313
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,470
- I need our patient.
- Syncope's cured,amber.It's over.

314
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,440
You obviously haven't stressed
The system hard enough.

315
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,550
You crank it up high
enough,Anyone will pass out.

316
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,210
This is incredible.

317
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,870
This is the most I've moved in 40 years.

318
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,340
The tilt table test Showed that the patient's
ekg,Bpm pulse remained Normal despite...

319
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,360
Who are you,thirteen?

320
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:26,160
My name's in the file.

321
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,510
Fact that you don't answer my questions tells me more about
you Than answers could.

322
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,640
No,it doesn't.

323
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,830
- We turned the thing Up to 95 degrees... - You
don't think that Non-answers tell me anything?

324
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,310
Sure,just not as much As actual
answers.That's why they're called Answers.

325
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:39,740
- Tells me you're hiding Something.
- Tells you I'm hiding everything.

326
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,850
Tells me you got something Worth
hiding.Is it turkish prison?Gay porn?

327
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:46,210
You killed a man,Just because
he was asking Too many questions?

328
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,150
- Can I finish reporting On the patient?
- No need.

329
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,450
I'll see you In an hour or so.
Got to set some stuff up.

330
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,030
Thank you all for coming...

331
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,070
To tribal council.

332
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,180
A man of your integrity I
feel I can trust.Big love.

333
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,480
and I don't call you that
Because you're a mormon.

334
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,390
Where's your team's sixth man?

335
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,210
she went rogue.Broke the rules.

336
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,030
You also sinned.You have no
right To cast the first stone.

337
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,930
And atheists have no
right To quote scripture.

338
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,430
The rules said no talking.

339
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,440
- I told them not to talk.
- Out loud.

340
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,280
We were trying To save a man's life.

341
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,990
Key word being "trying."Tilt table
test confirmed That you guys were wrong.

342
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,580
You're fired.

343
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,020
Ah,the prodigal son
returneth.You're also fired.

344
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,670
We thought there was a tumor
on the patient's esophagus.

345
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,160
We were right About the
area,Wrong about the diagnosis.

346
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:44,460
turns out the esophagus  is just
straightening.It's scleroderma.

347
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,070
Explains the syncope And the
choking.He needs steroids.

348
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:48,840
- you did a ct scan?
- Obviously.

349
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,110
After you were already Proven wrong?

350
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,900
Good for you.

351
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:54,980
It's too bad you're wrong.

352
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:57,330
Straightening Indicates
weakening,not hardening.

353
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,760
sma explains the weakening.

354
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,600
Strongyloides infection
Explains everything else.

355
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,200
You ladies have the honor To
give the patient A feeding tube,

356
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,500
discharge him,and show
up  for work tomorrow.

357
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,150
The rest of you,You're a disappointment.

358
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,330
You make me Want to stop dangling.

359
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,650
It was the best Two weeks of my life.

360
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,710
I think I will miss you  Most of
all,Ridiculously old fraud.

361
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,590
Do you think House Could be wrong?

362
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,790
I thought he fired you.

363
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,390
No.He fired the men.

364
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,390
I don't think He's wrong.

365
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,890
If he is, How would I prove it?

366
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,490
I just said I don't think he is.

367
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,190
Well,thinking Isn't good enough.

368
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,190
You have to run a blood test
For anticentromere antibodies.

369
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,790
Would you mind Running the labs?

370
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,790
You can't.

371
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,590
Well,i can,but...

372
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,690
No.I was making a statement.

373
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,790
You've been fired, So you no
longer have Lab privileges.

374
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,990
You weren't coming here For advice,

375
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,290
You were coming here To con
a favor to save your job.

376
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,790
Sorry.

377
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,990
I'm not working For him anymore, But
he can still Make my life miserable.

378
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,090
And you have a chance To
make his life miserable.

379
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,990
I'm insulted.

380
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,590
You con cameron By
appealing To her humanity.

381
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,190
I told her What she wanted to hear.

382
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,990
And you told me What you
thought I wanted to hear.

383
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,190
If it's any consolation, I think
your motives Are more interesting.

384
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,490
I cannot believe He fired you.

385
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,090
Go draw his blood.

386
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,390
I'll meet you in the
lab When I'm done here.

387
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,090
Guess you didn't find Your tumor.

388
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,490
The other doctors Tell
you that you were fine?

389
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,890
Yeah.

390
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,490
They said it was just
My disease getting worse.

391
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,090
You come to terms With this disease.

392
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,590
You know it's there.

393
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,290
you know it's waiting.

394
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,990
and every now and again...

395
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,890
It takes something away.

396
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,090
Took my walking.

397
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,690
Took my modesty.

398
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,790
Now it's taking One
of my last pleasures.

399
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,290
Well,there's an outside shot

400
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,190
That something other Than the
sma's causing Your eating problems.

401
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,590
And if it is, We can fix it.

402
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,290
and remove that tube.

403
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,790
Is that my blood?

404
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,590
It's green.

405
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,790
What does that mean?

406
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,590
It means I'm not fired.

407
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,590
Is he a vulcan?

408
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,290
If no,what makes nimoy Bleed green?

409
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,590
Are we officially Unfired?

410
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,690
How do we know she didn't
Fake the green blood?

411
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,090
Because that would be stupid.And
while she May be manipulative,

412
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,090
Borderline evil, Shallow...

413
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,890
They get it.

414
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,190
I'm not stupid.

415
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,090
what contrast did you use for the ct?

416
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,790
Icm.

417
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,890
His kidneys aren't working.

418
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,090
they didn't filter the
contrast, Which in icm is green.

419
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,090
Ten points.

420
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,690
Okay,let's add Kidney failure
To our list of symptoms.

421
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,590
what are these points?

422
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,090
Is that how you're deciding Who to fire?

423
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,790
I'm gonna fire The next person
who asks me Who I'm going to fire.

424
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,990
Now we're on the point system?

425
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,990
What happened to men Against women?

426
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,090
Forget the game.

427
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,090
What do you mean Forget the game?

428
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,990
I mean forget the damn game!

429
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,290
The guy's kidneys are failing.

430
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,790
We need to diagnose exactly...

431
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,990
I thought we Were diagnosing.

432
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,090
You were diagnosing.Now I am too.

433
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,590
I thought that thirteen Was
right about the strongyloides.

434
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,390
I was obviously wrong.

435
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,190
Okay,kidney failure,
Aspiration,fainting,go.

436
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,890
kidney failure could be the
result Of a gram negative bacteria.

437
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,690
Our patient wears A catheter full time.

438
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,990
it virtually guarantees
Bacterial infection.

439
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,190
Which could have migrated
Up to his kidneys.

440
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,190
Infection stresses His already
weakened system, Makes his sma worse.

441
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,090
That explains the choking And fainting.

442
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,690
Put him on An iv amp and gent.

443
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,990
our team's scleroderma
diagnosis still holds.

444
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,690
The tests could Have been negative Because
the blood Was tainted with contrast.

445
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,290
Do a skin biopsy.

446
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,490
Get a side of lymph node To confirm.

447
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,890
i could have you fired.

448
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,190
You already had me fired.

449
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,290
Just proves than I can.

450
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,890
And were the men wrong?

451
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,690
No.

452
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,390
- It doesn't change the fact...
- Why are you yelling at me?

453
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,390
Because performing tests For someone
who is not a doctor In this hospital...

454
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,390
You're frustrated.

455
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,590
You want help?I'm here.If you
just need to vent, Leave a message.

456
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,990
I like him better like this.

457
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,790
You?

458
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,190
Patient developed Pneumonia.

459
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,490
His lungs are filling fast.

460
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,290
We started him on antibiotics.Nothing.

461
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,290
- We were wrong.
- And you're here to say...?

462
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,590
We were wrong too.He
doesn't have scleroderma.

463
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,590
Biopsy revealed No fibrotic changes.

464
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,590
Cervical lymph node Has black flecks.

465
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,690
Small areas of necrosis.It's nothing.

466
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,290
You say nothing.I say cancer.

467
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,290
It's a bit of a stretch
To jump right to cancer.

468
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,090
I'm not jumping.Broad specs haven't
worked, So it's not bacterial.

469
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,690
Failing liver Despite treatment
Suggests it's not fungal.

470
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,790
And her high lactic acidosis Points
towards anaplastic Large cell lymphoma.

471
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,590
Also suggests Infection, Which is
a lot easier And safer to treat.

472
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,690
Large cell lymphoma Is
incredibly aggressive.

473
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,690
She'll be dead in a week
If we follow the textbooks.

474
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,290
Unless it's infection, In which case You
radiate her And she'll be dead In a day.

475
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,790
I know you have some
experience With that.

476
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,590
I've seen doctors Do this before.

477
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,890
Go back to the scene Of the crime.

478
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,590
If you're right this time, You
purge yourself Of past ghosts.

479
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,690
I know it's contrary To protocol,
But I think it's more likely...

480
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,690
Ghosts are there For a reason.

481
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,590
So you don't make The
same mistake twice.

482
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,090
Switch over to
third-generation Cephalosporin.

483
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,790
You want to remove his eye?

484
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,690
Who told you?

485
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,190
You booked the o.r.

486
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,590
Good.

487
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,490
You can't beat me In a foot race.

488
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,890
I thought We were dancing.

489
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,890
Cervical lymph node Is a garbage dump.

490
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,890
Very small one.

491
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,090
Just one truck comes in And
only comes from one home.

492
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,790
Al gore would be Appalled.The home...

493
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,690
The home is the right eye.I get it.

494
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,290
- Do a biopsy.
- on my way.

495
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,790
You're not doing A biopsy.

496
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,290
You ordered An orbital exenteration.

497
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,490
Right.Because I don't want
To remove A little tiny piece,

498
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,090
Sit in the lab And confirm
What I already know,

499
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,090
While my patient
drowns In his own fluid.

500
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,690
But if you want me
to, I absolutely will.

501
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,890
How advanced Is the pneumonia?

502
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,590
It's taking college courses.

503
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,590
Hey,wilson, I'm gonna cut
Some cripple's eye out.

504
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,990
Wanna come watch?

505
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,290
Good times.

506
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,790
We good to go?

507
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,990
I thought melanoma Was skin cancer.

508
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,290
Technically it's cancer
Of the pigment cells.

509
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,090
The same cells that
give Your iris its color.

510
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,990
cancer?

511
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,390
Why not?What else can god throw at me?

512
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,290
Hail,locusts, Smiting of the first born.

513
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,090
Of course it all depends
On how evil you've been.

514
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,590
House...

515
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,690
If it's cancer,it's
spread Everywhere,right?

516
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,790
so it's in my lungs, My kidneys?

517
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,490
There is a chance By removing
the eye, Get the primary tumor,

518
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,490
and three courses of
radiation, That could...

519
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,290
could...what?

520
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,390
few months?Years?

521
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,190
More likely months.

522
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,890
Any of your other doctors
Have any cheerier diagnoses?

523
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,890
if they do,they're
wrong.This is the answer.

524
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,490
It's the only way To help you.

525
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,790
I already Can't walk.

526
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,590
I can't eat.

527
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,290
You're telling me That the
rest of my life Is in this bed,

528
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,390
Puking and in pain?

529
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,290
We can manage the pain.

530
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,090
I'd rather just Get this over with.

531
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,590
I've been trapped in this
Useless body long enough.

532
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,990
It'd be nice To finally get out.

533
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,490
Get out and go where?

534
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,990
you think you're gonna sprout wings,

535
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,590
and start flying around
with the other angels?

536
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,690
Don't be an idiot.There is
no after, There's just this.

537
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,290
House!

538
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,090
You can't let a dying man
Take solace in his beliefs?

539
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,390
His beliefs Are stupid.

540
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,790
Everybody lies.

541
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,290
Some for good reason, Some for bad,

542
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,090
This would have been A
fantastic reason to lie.

543
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,790
Hi,greg House.

544
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,990
Why can't you just Let
him have his fairy tale?

545
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,990
If it gives him comfort
To imagine beaches,

546
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,390
And loved ones,and life
outside A wheel chair...

547
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,090
Are there 72 virgins too?

548
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,190
It's over.

549
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,590
He's got days, Maybe hours left.

550
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,490
What pain does it cause you If he
spends that time With a peaceful smile?

551
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,790
What sick pleasure do you
get In making damn sure

552
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,490
He's filled With fear and dread?

553
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,490
He shouldn't be making A
decision based on a lie.

554
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,790
Misery's better than nothing.

555
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,190
You don't know there's nothing.

556
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,190
You haven't been there.

557
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,290
Oh,god.I am tired Of that argument.

558
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,790
I don't have to go To detroit
To know that it smells.

559
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,390
Yes,detroit, The afterlife.Same thing.

560
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:50,192
Song: Not As We
Singer: Alanis Morissette

561
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,790
blurry vision

562
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,490
You're not getting Enough oxygen,

563
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,790
So we're inserting A tube
Directly Into your lungs.

564
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,990
It should help us drain
Some of this excess fluid.

565
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,890
It should make you A
little more comfortable.

566
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,890
sats are still dropping.

567
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,490
fluid's clear.

568
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,490
If this was cancer,
There should be blood.

569
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,790
Call House.

570
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,490
He just paged me.

571
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,190
dctor House

572
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,790
Maybe it was...

573
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,590
Just an accident.

574
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,290
It wasn't an accident.

575
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,190
You think his nihilism Got the best
of him?He tried to kill himself?

576
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,190
He paged me.

577
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,890
- Paged you?
- Why you?

578
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,090
- I assume because...
- don't assume anything.

579
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,490
Don't fall into that trap.

580
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,690
Is he okay?

581
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,290
Burned his hand pretty good.

582
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,390
His heart stopped For nearly a minute.

583
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,590
Your cohort managed to restart it.

584
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,090
but he...Has not regained consciousness.

585
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,290
so...

586
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:26,390
Since I have you all here, We should
probably talk About your actual patient.

587
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,390
clear fluid from the lungs indicates
that it's probably Not cancer.

588
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,590
So it would be nice If we
could come up With a new idea.

589
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,690
You're an idiot.

590
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,190
you nearly killed yourself.

591
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,390
That was the whole idea.

592
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,490
You wanted to kill yourself?

593
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,790
I wanted to nearly kill myself.

594
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,990
- is he...Better?
- no.

595
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,390
But he doesn't have cancer.

596
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,390
We think it might be
Eosinophilic pneumonia.

597
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,290
Maybe you didn't wanna die, But
you didn't care If you lived.

598
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,190
You insisted that i
needed To see for myself.

599
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,290
- Was he discharged?
- No.He's dying.

600
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,690
You've already had Two
near death experiences.

601
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,490
Not that guy.

602
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,890
The guy in the car
accident, With the knife.

603
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,990
I...i need to talk to him.

604
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,190
He died Almost an hour ago.

605
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,090
Apparently it's bad
To electrocute yourself

606
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,190
Within days of suffering
Massive internal injuries.

607
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,790
Why did you need To talk to him?

608
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,490
Did you see something?

609
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,390
Eosinophilic pneumonia.

610
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,690
House?What did you see?

611
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,990
Nothing.

612
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,790
Whose idea was that?

613
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,690
Brennan.Nothing you don't Want
to talk about it, Or nothing...

614
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,990
Which one is brennan?

615
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,990
Is he the ridiculously Old guy?

616
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,890
House,you got to talk About this.

617
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:54,590
If it's aggressive enough, It
might have gotten Past the steroids.

618
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,490
Start him on cyclophosamide.

619
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,990
i already did.

620
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,090
Just looking at you hurts.

621
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,590
I'm gonna order up Some extra pain meds.

622
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,790
I love you.

623
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,690
How fast will this work?

624
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:16,490
New meds should start Helping
in minutes,okay?Hang in there.

625
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,190
Vacutainer's full.I need to replace it.

626
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,890
I don't... I don't think...

627
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,090
It's working.

628
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,890
Try and relax.

629
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,190
You must...you must be wrong.

630
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,090
Stop talking.

631
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,390
Hurry up and get That
chest tube working.

632
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,490
Okay, I got it.

633
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,990
Could you get...

634
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,990
Hoover?

635
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,390
I can't...

636
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,290
can you...

637
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,390
Put my hand...

638
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,990
On his head?

639
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,390
It's okay.Don't worry.

640
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,490
I'm not scared.

641
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,990
Oh,god.

642
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,090
Time of death?

643
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,190
You're looking better.

644
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,590
Stark's dead.

645
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,890
What are you doing?

646
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,890
Going to see our patient.

647
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,290
He's dead.

648
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,290
Dead is not a diagnosis.

649
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,190
You really shouldn't be...

650
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,490
Shut up and give me my cane.

651
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,590
I assume we're all fired.

652
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,890
Should I fire myself too?

653
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,290
I thought it was Strongyloides,
Then I thought It was cancer.

654
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,590
- A little help here.
- Ready?One,two...

655
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,890
Why did you call me?

656
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,590
Because if I pooped myself In front
of wilson,I'd never hear The end of it.

657
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,290
But why not One of the others?

658
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,690
You always have That phone in your hand.

659
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,390
We all have cell phones.That's
not the reason.What is?

660
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,790
If I died, You'd never get the job.

661
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,790
I knew you wouldn't let That happen.

662
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,290
You don't think Anybody
else Has any reason to care?

663
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,990
Think this is starting
To come back to me.

664
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,190
It's right,left, Then repeat.

665
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,590
Yeah,that works.

666
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,590
What did we miss?

667
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,290
If we knew, He wouldn't be dead.

668
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,490
That's it?You're just gonna Give up?

669
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,890
No,we were defeated.It's over.

670
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,590
Patient presented With syncope.

671
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,190
We thought it was thread
worms, Gave him ivermectin.

672
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,190
Thank you.

673
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,290
He seemed better, Till
his blood turned green.

674
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,390
Can we at least Remove the body Before
launching Into a purely academic exercise?

675
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,690
Patient didn't respond To
antibiotics or steroids.

676
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,790
You okay,boy?

677
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,590
What's wrong with the dog?

678
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,890
He's dead.

679
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:56,190
There are only A handful of viruses
That can cross Between dogs and humans.

680
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,090
but they may not be connected at all.

681
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,890
the dog was old.I've seen it before.

682
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:03,590
they hang on way past their normal life
expectancy To take care of their masters.

683
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,790
Did you watch him Take the pills?

684
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,990
The ivermectin.

685
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,290
Did you watch the patient Put
them in his mouth And swallow them?

686
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,090
I don't know.I think so.

687
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,190
What kind of dog is that?

688
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,290
English shepherd.

689
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,490
- It's in the collie family, Right?
- Not really.

690
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,990
- They share the mdr1 gene.
- yeah.

691
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,090
What happens When you give a dog
With the mdr1 gene Ivermectin?

692
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,490
They don't...i mean, It's used
to treat Heartworms in most dogs,

693
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,790
but it'd be fatal If the...

694
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,990
Look familiar?

695
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,790
I think the last time You saw it,

696
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,190
It didn't have that dead
dog's Teeth marks on it.

697
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,390
I just put it on the bed
tray To get him some water.

698
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:52,990
When I asked you If you watched the patient
Swallow the pills,The right answer was "no."

699
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,590
Take his body down To the morgue.

700
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:14,090
If you hadn't treated This patient
as a game, He wouldn't be dead.

701
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,890
I'm feeling much better, Thank you.

702
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,490
I'm supposed To show you sympathy?

703
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,990
He died while his attending
Was lying on a hospital bed,

704
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,690
Because he stuck A
knife in a wall socket.

705
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,390
He died because a doctor Made a mistake.

706
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,190
She was an idiot.

707
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,890
You employed her.

708
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,590
You're responsible.

709
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,690
Doctor foreman.

710
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,690
How's she doing?

711
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,690
Fever's gone.

712
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,390
A.s.t.And a.l.t.Are
back Within normal range.

713
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,790
She should be out of here In a few days.

714
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,890
Gutsy call.

715
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,890
Thanks.

716
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,890
It wasn't a compliment.

717
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,690
If you were wrong, She'd be dead.

718
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,390
- I was sure...
- No,you weren't.You couldn't be.

719
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,090
There's a reason We have rules.

720
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,590
If every doctor did Whatever
his gut Told him was right,

721
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,790
We'd have a lot more
Dead bodies to deal with.

722
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,590
It won't happen again.

723
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,090
Yes,it will.

724
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,190
Because you confuse Saving her
life With doing the right thing.

725
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,790
I'm sorry dr.Foreman, You're fired.

726
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,690
As soon as the pathologist Cut into
the lungs,We saw the threadworms.

727
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,790
You think it's fair That I fired
all The other members of your team

728
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,990
When you guys Actually came
up With the right diagnosis?

729
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,490
I keep replaying it In my mind.

730
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,590
Did I drop the pills When
i put them on the bed tray?

731
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,090
Did I knock them over
When I turned to leave?

732
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,890
You know he'd be alive.

733
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,090
His dog would be alive.

734
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,790
I know.

735
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,190
You forced us to act
On a false assumption.

736
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,290
I know.

737
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:28,690
Everything we built From that step on...

738
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,290
Every test,every theory,
Every treatment...

739
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:36,590
I know.Forget the lecturey.***

740
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,590
If I was gonna fire you, I
wouldn't be giving you The lecture.

741
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,190
I know you're not gonna let
Anything like this Ever happen again.

742
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,590
I'll see you tomorrow.

743
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:11,090
I'm sorry to say "i told you so" .
