1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,970
LOL

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,910
But they're all so quiet.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,310
Awkward smiles and sweaty palms.

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,110
I'm not expecting brad pitt
to walk into st. Theresa's.

5
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,950
Just someone who makes
me laugh.Has a nice smile.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,600
Full head of hair.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,150
You know,

8
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,030
someone like you,mr. Franklin.

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,410
It's a shame they're
going to cremate you.

10
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,860
can I help you?

11
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,870
Martin!

12
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,650
Martin!

13
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,240
My purse is right there.Go ahead.

14
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,170
Take whatever you want.

15
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,420
ah!

16
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,640
Irene? You call me?

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,520
Irene?

18
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,410
Irene!

22
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,100
How're you doing?

23
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,900
I'm fine.

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,830
Fyi...

25
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,800
If you ask me,it's more
the guys' fault than yours.

26
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,930
And house isn't blameless either.

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,070
- If he hadn't pitted us all against each other...
- It was my fault.

28
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,890
My mistake.

29
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,080
Was that always there?

30
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,260
Hello.

31
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,860
Sure.

32
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,620
It's house.

33
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,350
Good morning,angels.

34
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:16,570
As you will see from the file,we
have quite the interesting case.

35
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,750
Not often do you get a
patient who sees dead people.

36
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,920
What file?

37
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,920
What the hell?

38
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,810
I gave it to bosley a half hour ago.

39
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,630
It was not a half
hour.It was ten minutes.

40
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,350
And he made copies of
the er records first.

41
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,210
Less lip,more whip.

42
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,450
I only agreed to take this case

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,650
because you said that this mocha
frapalicious would have whip on it.

44
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,570
Fine. I'll refer the case to foreman.

45
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,980
Can't. Mercy fired him.

46
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,250
- Gimme.
- He got fired?

47
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,560
He disobeyed a superior
officer under fire.

48
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,560
- He's lucky he wasn't executed.
- How do you know about it?You keeping tabs on him?

49
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,450
Girls talk.

50
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,810
When bosley drags his
ancient ass in there...

51
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,360
I'm here.

52
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,240
24-year-old
funeral cosmetician

53
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,930
suffered a grand mal seizure at work.

54
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,090
- Why does he get to be bosley?
- You want to be bosley?

55
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,170
Bosley's like the asexual messenger boy.

56
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:10,180
She had a vision of being raped
by a cadaver before passing out.

57
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,660
Seizure rules out psychiatric illness.

58
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,580
No history of epilepsy,head
trauma,or drug use.

59
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,340
Bosley keeps his job while they
replace five angels over three seasons.

60
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,910
Could be a tumor to the temporal lobe.

61
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,410
Not with a normal ct scan.

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,440
You mean it appeared
normal to the doc in the er.

63
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,860
Way to get right back
on that horse,thirteen.

64
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,600
- That was amber.
- Nice try,cutthroat bitch.

65
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,510
That was the worst thirteen
imitation I've ever heard.

66
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,760
- Funeral home prep rooms are filled with toxic chemicals.
- And cadavers.

67
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,130
Everybody in that place
obviously died from something.

68
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,670
I have a question.Is he
the one who's not a doctor?

69
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,540
Bullets aren't contagious.But
infections,parasites...

70
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,440
You said one of us wasn't a
doctor,and you called him a fraud.

71
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,160
He's not a doctor.Continue,boz.

72
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,140
- Could be an std...
- Why isn't he fired?

73
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,110
Oh,you're breaking up.

74
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,610
I'm going into a tunnel.

75
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,860
Dark religious nut.

76
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,460
- What did you call me?
- I'm sorry.

77
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,620
What do you people want
to be called this week?

78
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,840
Cole.

79
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,700
I'm never gonna remember that.

80
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,710
Take bosley and the other visible
minority to the funeral home.

81
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,680
The rest of you young,white
people,the world is your oyster.

82
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,200
Get an mri with
contrast,eeg,lp,and blood panel.

83
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,820
And,angels,be careful.

84
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,090
Just because he's religious
doesn't mean he won't kick your ass.

85
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,200
- You want to bet?
- no.

86
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,770
I want you to stop
being such a jerk to him.

87
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,170
$100.

88
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,030
Smart call.The guy's a wuss.

89
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,820
He's gonna be the next one on the train.

90
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,510
Define "kick your ass."

91
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,350
- Any physical confrontation...
- Or verbal?

92
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,980
- Define verbal.
- Anything over...70 decibels.

93
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,240
And you can't start
suddenly being nice to him.

94
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,990
You realize what
you're encouraging here.

95
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,010
Yeah,someone kickin' your ass.

96
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,820
The space inside is
smaller than I thought.

97
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,200
Don't worry,reena.

98
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,850
The doctors are going to
take good care of you,right?

99
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,870
Once the valium kicks
in,you'll feel better.

100
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,310
And then we'll have some
nice,warm milk when you're done.

101
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,690
- I'd rather have more valium.
- Reena.

102
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,040
Let's wait just a bit,see how it goes.

103
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,410
Try to lie as still as possible.

104
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,700
I guess father time's a
lock for one of the spots.

105
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,250
Thirteen's a lock.

106
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,590
He doesn't have a medical
license and he's still around.

107
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,470
She killed a guy in a wheelchair.

108
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,130
And his dog.

109
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,320
He doesn't care about our qualifications

110
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,570
or ideas.

111
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,470
He just wants to have fun.

112
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,300
And she's the ultimate fun
'cause he can't figure her out.

113
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,790
This game is insane.

114
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,580
So quit. Happy to lose the competition.

115
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,540
If it's gonna be on your resume,

116
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,940
it's gotta be better
to quit than get fired.

117
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,990
Either quit or shut up.

118
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,530
Actually,with house,getting
fired might look better.

119
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,120
Dr. House is a dangerous egomaniac.

120
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,640
That's why I left.

121
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,050
We had different ideas
on how to practice.

122
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,900
Glad to hear it.

123
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,400
Tell me about mercy.

124
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,400
To be honest,I don't think Dr.
Schaffer really gave me a chance.

125
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,330
Obviously not.You were there
for three weeks. What happened?

126
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,730
Saved a patient's life.

127
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,270
That's usually not
grounds for dismissal.

128
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,720
- Have you spoken to her?
- Yes.

129
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,670
Then why are you
asking me what happened?

130
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,230
You have an excellent resume.

131
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,260
I felt I owed it to you to
hear what you had to say.

132
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,280
- What'd she tell you?
- That you defied her instructions and hospital procedures.

133
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,630
That's what happened.Nothing
more I can add to that.

134
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,800
You could tell me that you were wrong.

135
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,390
Sounds like you didn't leave
house quite soon enough.

136
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,600
Cadavers were clean.So is her food.

137
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,830
It's all organic unprocessed crap.

138
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,350
It's gotta be the embalming fluid.

139
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:01,200
- Ethanol can have psychoactive effects...
- Bosley!

140
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,110
Tell whoever's talking
that he's an idiot.

141
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,540
Bosley.Either tell him he's an idiot,

142
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,810
or tell me why I'm wrong.

143
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,200
You're an idiot.

144
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,350
You actually think
that I'd take a patient

145
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,340
who had a seizure in a funeral home

146
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,690
if the er hadn't already
ruled out embalming fluid?

147
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,790
- I thought we weren't supposed to trust...
- Idiot,

148
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,910
from the old french,"idiote," meaning

149
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,370
effeminate,mentally deficient moor.

150
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,960
I found something in the
mortuary's files from '05.

151
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,490
A 48-year-old male's cause of
death was listed as pneumonia,

152
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,340
but the symptoms in the
autopsy report didn't fit.

153
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,500
- Confusion,memory loss,depression.
- Mad cow.

154
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,430
Very cool.

155
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,200
No,she's a vegetarian and only
ate organic vegetables at that.

156
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,340
Tell him he's an idiot again.

157
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,840
The disease can be
spread by brain tissue.

158
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,780
Which is very cool. Run with it.

159
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,400
So because the answer might be "cool,"

160
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,240
you want us to do a brain
biopsy on a 24-year-old woman?

161
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,530
No,because the answer is something cool,

162
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,260
I want you to do a brain biopsy
on a 48-year-old dead guy.

163
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,170
The guy's already been buried.

164
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,280
We dig him up.

165
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,830
I am not digging up a
body without a court order.

166
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,510
Don't think of it as digging up a body.

167
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,320
Think of it as keeping
another one from being buried.

168
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,190
I can't do it.

169
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,160
We gonna have another one of those
ecumenical discussions where I tell you

170
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,260
that your beliefs are
ridiculous and you totally cave?

171
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,340
I just gotta be home at 6:00.

172
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,450
The sabbath.

173
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,010
The lord works for six days,then
tells the union he needs a rest.

174
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,730
You know,if I was all-powerful,

175
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,360
it'd take at least two days.

176
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,620
It's thursday.

177
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,710
Well,then it must be the kid.

178
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,390
You have oatmeal on your pants.

179
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,190
- Do you have a camera in here?
- No. I was guessing.

180
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,790
He had oatmeal on his pants
yesterday and the day before.

181
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,100
Have one of your wives
look after the spawn.

182
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:00,320
I'm a single dad.

183
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,920
Where's the single mom?

184
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,480
I have no idea.

185
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,730
Interesting.

186
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,000
You claim a lapse of judgment,

187
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:15,250
or you gonna admit
that a lapse in judgment

188
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,110
- is a lapse in faith?
- He's gone.

189
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,440
Fair enough.

190
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,090
Family comes first.

191
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:33,680
Dr. Cuddy,i'm amber volakis,one
of Dr. House's new fellows.

192
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,940
Sexual harassment claims go through
h.r.Stress-related leaves through worker's comp,

193
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,280
and any accusations
of criminal activities

194
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,110
go directly to the princeton
plainsboro police department.

195
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,430
Actually,I was wondering if you needed
any extra help in the clinic tonight.

196
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,260
You're not going to score any
points with house by kissing my ass.

197
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,090
Understood.But I hear Dr.
House hates clinic duty.

198
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,790
If he were to hear through the grapevine
that I was willing to work overtime,

199
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,030
- take some of it off his hands...
- My advice to you

200
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,590
is to do whatever house
wants you to do tonight.

201
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,250
And then tomorrow
night,you can come back

202
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,490
and I will give you extra clinic duty.

203
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,790
Does everybody around
here have trust issues?

204
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,800
I don't know what house wants you
to do,and I don't want to know.

205
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,120
But if you really have a
problem with it,quit now.

206
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,350
It's only gonna get worse.

207
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,660
- All right,who's up?
- Not me.

208
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,250
You haven't done any digging yet.

209
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,420
I'm a surgeon.If anything happens
to these hands,I'm screwed.

210
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,500
Let bosley do it.As long as
he can keep folding laundry...

211
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,370
Shh,shh,shh.

212
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,160
Someone's coming.

213
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,070
- Shouldn't we be running?
- If it's a cop,run.

214
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,390
Security guard,I say we take him down.

215
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,510
Sorry I'm late.

216
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,620
- Where the hell have you been?
- Oh,I got lost.

217
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,420
Been here over three hours.

218
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,660
Really lost.

219
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,560
I brought coffee and donuts.

220
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,340
So thirteen,you grow up around here?

221
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,080
We're digging up a grave,and
you want to chit-chat?

222
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,780
I'm just making
conversation.It's what people do.

223
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,670
Why are you hiding everything?

224
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,930
And I'm asking you that question
because you're hiding everything.

225
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,180
There's something
seriously wrong with you.

226
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,110
I'm worried.

227
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,740
No,you're not.

228
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,150
Fine,but I am freaked,because
I don't think you're a freak.

229
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,520
I think you're doing this on purpose

230
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,610
because you know house
will be intrigued.

231
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,830
Yeah,I grew up around here.

232
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,900
Honey,I'm home.

233
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,510
Get the crowbar.

234
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,700
No,there's not enough room to
maneuver a crowbar down here.

235
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,060
Oh,god help us.

236
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,200
- What the hell?
- What is it?

237
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,800
Ankles.They buried the
guy the wrong way around.

238
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,240
The doctor's lounge is covered in mud.

239
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,900
Thirteen and cutthroat
bitch had a disagreement,

240
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,780
and the cafeteria was out of jell-o.

241
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,800
There were pickaxes.

242
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,630
Either you had them dig up a body,

243
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,420
or you're building a railroad.

244
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,070
A little tiny piece of
his brain.Seemed a waste.

245
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,360
- He wasn't using it anymore.
- That's your defense?

246
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,330
"we just dismembered him"?

247
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,550
They're looking for creutzfeldt-jakob.

248
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,430
You get the results yet?

249
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,730
Does my breath smell baited to you?

250
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,650
Yes.

251
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,930
Let me know when you hear anything.

252
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,680
And get that mess in the
shower area cleaned up.

253
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,200
I know just the guy.

254
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,740
How many of them agreed
to dig up a grave?

255
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,130
Six.

256
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,150
But don't worry,the one who
didn't didn't stand on principle.

257
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,420
He just had a diaper to change.

258
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:06,130
I really think there are no
bad choices in this group.

259
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,620
You guys don't wipe your feet
when you come in the house?

260
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,360
Doctor's lounge.Let's go.

261
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,590
Why me?

262
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,070
I can't ask the black guy or
one of the chicks to do it,

263
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,320
that would be insensitive.

264
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,340
And you can't ask bosley

265
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,910
because that'd look like you only hired
the non-doctor to do non-doctor stuff.

266
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,200
You keep stalling,you're
still gonna clean up,

267
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,050
but I won't let you have the mop.

268
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,260
Sample came back negative
for creutzfeldt-jakob.

269
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,560
Well,that discussion didn't last long.

270
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,440
I just don't know what else there is.

271
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,220
We had an idea.

272
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,630
It was wrong.

273
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,280
Well,we can go home.

274
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,370
I mean,we have no idea
what's wrong with her.

275
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,170
Which means it could
be completely benign.

276
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,400
Or,on the off chance
that it'skillingher,

277
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,100
we could take it again from the top.

278
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,660
You've already done everything.

279
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,810
We may have missed something.

280
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,480
I just want to go
home.I'm sure I'm fine now.

281
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,520
Reena,the doctors know best.

282
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,180
You had some serious
symptoms.The seizure...

283
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,810
If I have another one,i'll
come right back,okay?

284
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,280
If you have it while you're driving...

285
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,080
You can drive me.Make
sure I take it easy.

286
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,700
Who can?

287
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,550
My mother.

288
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,350
- Your mother's here?
- What are you talking about?She's right there.

289
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,150
You sampled every bodily
fluid,peeked in her brain,

290
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,030
violated a cadaver's
privacy,dug up a body,

291
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,730
but missed the fact

292
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,260
she was still seeing
things that weren't there.

293
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,810
Neurological symptoms are getting worse.

294
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,710
It'd be nice if one of you
angels¡¢morons had a clue why.

295
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,170
We did a full history.She never mentioned
seeing or hearing anything unusual.

296
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,370
Oh,well,as long as she
never said anything.

297
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,470
How were you to know?Same
thing with the spinal fluid?

298
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,620
She tell you that was fine?

299
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,350
The labs were all clear.

300
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,070
Then either we're about to
meet the alpha and omega,

301
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,260
or you missed something.

302
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,200
- We missed the new symptom.
- It's not a new symptom.

303
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,830
We always knew she had hallucinations.

304
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,040
Seeing her dead
mother's a hallucination.

305
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,820
Not knowing she's dead is a delusion.

306
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,200
You keep this up,you're gonna have
to start wearing sexier clothes.

307
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,580
Uh,carbon monoxide could
also cause delusions.

308
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,340
- A lot of haunted houses...
- There's no headache.No tachycardia.

309
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,390
I guess they didn't cover
that atyourmedical school.

310
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,190
What about a hereditary connection?

311
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,510
She's 24.Her mother
died when she was 25.

312
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,710
In ukraine,20 years ago.Good
luck trying to get those records.

313
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,270
We start new records.

314
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,010
Test for every hereditary
disease that fits the symptoms.

315
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,450
There are at least 40 different mitochondrial
disorders,another couple hundred...

316
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,810
Start with amyloidosis,keep
going until you reach...

317
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,630
Zamyloidosis.

318
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,000
Now what are you testing for?

319
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,080
Or should I ask what
you're not testing for?

320
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,210
Well,we could narrow it down

321
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,980
if you could rember what
your mother died from.

322
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,100
My mother is not dead.She's
sitting right there.

323
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,370
- Do you think we're lying to you?
- Leave it alone.

324
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,870
Convincing her that her mother's
dead isn't gonna make her better,

325
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,700
just miserable.

326
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,360
You lose your mother?

327
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,180
Do you think we're trying to trick you?

328
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,650
Why would we do that?

329
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,500
Because you're mean.

330
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,120
And you're not good at your job.

331
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,600
Reena,stop.You're being cruel.

332
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,320
They're wasting time...

333
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,730
Doing exactly what the guy in
the wheelchair said they'd do.

334
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,430
- A guy in a wheelchair was here?
- You know who I'm talking about.

335
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,120
He's been hanging around
ever since they brought me in

336
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,060
complaing about how
incompetent everyone is.

337
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,520
Said you killed his dog.

338
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,830
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I'm not interested.

339
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,880
If you weren't interested,you
wouldn't be here.

340
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,610
I thought it was social.

341
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,890
No,you didn't.You always
think there's an agenda.

342
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,450
- That's why I left.
- That's why you're good.

343
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:43,120
- You need a job.
- I'll find a job.

344
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,750
- And I need someone that understands house.
- They'll learn.

345
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,660
- I need someone that can control house.
- ha.

346
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,800
Keep looking.Might take awhile.

347
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,240
I'll cut the salary of everyone
else on the team 15%,give it to you.

348
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,550
That's more than you'll
get anywhere else.

349
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,370
What does house say about this?

350
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,390
You're the one person on the
team that he always respected.

351
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,710
This restaurant is 20
minutes out of your way.

352
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,190
Half an hour out of mine.

353
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,080
You picked it to make sure
house didn't drop in on us.

354
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,450
It's my decision,not his.

355
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,830
And you tell him that,then run back to
your office while I get to deal with him.

356
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,140
I left for a reason,and
that reason hasn't changed.

357
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:36,630
So... What's the news?

358
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,610
Everything's negative so far.

359
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,650
Yes. Why wait to finish
before reporting to me?

360
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,040
I have things to do,you know.

361
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,590
- She's seeing someone else.
- That's not news.

362
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,010
That's olds.

363
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,050
Damn it.

364
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,380
Why did god design the
human body this way?

365
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,580
- A guy in a wheelchair.
- In a hospital.

366
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,350
It's enough to give
you the heebie-jeebies.

367
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,150
He had adog.She's seeing stark.

368
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,030
Our last patient.

369
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:03,690
Well,if it's stark,he
wouldn't be haunting a patient,

370
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,160
he'd be haunting the
doctor who killed him.

371
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,800
She probably just overheard
someone talking about it...

372
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,190
Probably?

373
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,820
You think there's a possibility
that the alternative is true?

374
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,430
- no.
- Then go away.

375
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,650
We're wasting time.We ran 32
gels.We could run 100 more.

376
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,160
Without knowing how her mother died...

377
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,000
You're gonna have to run 100 more.

378
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,800
And by you,of course,i'm
only referring to the people

379
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,750
who care enough about human
life to put in a full day.

380
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,570
You want to carpool?

381
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,460
how do you expect me to
respond to this stuff?

382
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,520
Exactly like you just did.

383
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,090
I have a theory.Maybe
you can help me out.

384
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,520
Black mormon means masochist.

385
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,430
Means kinky.

386
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,260
I'm thinking that someone got
hurt making the bastard.Am I right?

387
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,410
You leave my son out of this.

388
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,520
I wasn't referring to your kid's
hypocrisy.I was referring to yours.

389
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,100
Why don't we just ask
her how she died,hm?

390
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,020
Because she won't tell us.

391
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,560
She thinks her mother's still alive.

392
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,350
I don't mean ask the
patient,I mean ask her mother.

393
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,860
Cool.

394
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:06,230
Come on.

395
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,720
What the hell does that mean?

396
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,700
You guys talking your own language now?

397
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,870
I'm sorry.I'll try to include
some visual aids next time.

398
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,500
Now what?

399
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,340
I'm Dr. House.

400
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,470
- Is your mom around?
- Why should I tell you?

401
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,530
You're just going to tell
me i'm lying or crazy.

402
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,090
Not gonna do that.

403
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,260
I really need to know
what she has to say.

404
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,530
What do you want?

405
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,810
- When you were young,was she...
- No,not you. Him.

406
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,830
- The man in the wheelchair?
- no.

407
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,800
He's old.

408
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,220
Actually,looks like you.

409
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:07,890
Yeah,that's grandpa house.

410
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:10,190
Tell him to call back on a land line.

411
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,940
Terrible reception in here.

412
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,970
How much pain was your mom in?

413
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,200
- It's walter.
- He says his name is walter.

414
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,790
Can I help you?

415
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,990
My patient's talking to my grandpa walt.

416
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,290
You have a grandpa walt?

417
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,590
no.

418
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,290
Which is what made me suspect that maybe
she's not actually seeing into the afterlife.

419
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,590
What is this sudden
obsession with the afterlife?

420
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,090
Only obsession is with the idiots
in the right-here-and-now life

421
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,390
who think there's an afterlife.

422
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,090
And you want me to...

423
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,690
Nothing. Just need a place
to hang low for awhile.

424
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,590
I'm pretending to be spooked.

425
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,190
Because...

426
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,990
Because if my soon-to-be brain-dead
patient thinks that I believe her,

427
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,790
maybe she'll let me chat
with her mother's ghost.

428
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,990
The one you don't believe exists.

429
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,390
Exactly. The ghost is a hallucination,
 which is the result of a delusion

430
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,790
which most likely is the
result of a hereditary disease

431
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,890
that her mother died from
when the patient was four.

432
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,990
And you think you can tap
into her subconscious memory

433
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,090
by tapping into her hallucination.

434
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,890
She might not know what
caused her mother's death,

435
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,390
but she will know how
she acted before she died.

436
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,090
You're quite impressed with
yourself right now, aren't you?

437
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,690
Who wouldn't be?

438
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,790
Well,that should be long enough.

439
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,890
Back in a flash.

440
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,690
Take your time.

441
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,690
Is my grandfather still here?

442
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,690
no.

443
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,590
He should be right back.

444
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,390
He just went to get some warm milk.

445
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,690
But your mom's still here, right?

446
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,290
Yes,of course.

447
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,290
I know she's fine now, but when
you were 4 or 5,she got sick.

448
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,490
no.

449
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,690
You sure?

450
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,290
She wasn't in any pain?

451
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,090
I wasn't in pain.

452
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,690
She was just tired.

453
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,890
And sometimes she would
stay in bed all day.

454
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,990
Did she ever fall down?

455
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,190
Of course.

456
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,490
Everyone falls down once in awhile.

457
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,590
Sometimes.Not that often.

458
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,890
How often?

459
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,390
Maybe it was actually
more than once in awhile.

460
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,990
Remember that time in the bathroom?

461
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,490
A few times.

462
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,090
Once she hit her head
on the bathroom sink.

463
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,590
There was blood all over the floor.

464
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,190
I got it on my sweater.

465
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,190
They took her away.

466
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,890
To the place where the
doctor made her better.

467
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,590
But before that, what
about her arms and legs?

468
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,790
Did she ever walk funny?

469
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,990
Like sort of bent over?

470
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,190
I thought that was from
growing up on the farm.

471
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,890
What about her hands?

472
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,990
She ever have any difficulty sewing,

473
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,190
buttoning a shirt?

474
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,290
no.

475
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,590
But sometimes, my hands would,um,shiver.

476
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,290
Like I was cold.

477
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,290
But I wasn't.

478
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,890
I never quite understood.

479
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,990
She used to get the
shivers like she was cold.

480
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,690
Start her on l-dopa and bromocriptine.

481
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,190
It's just parkinson's.

482
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,890
Cole.

483
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,790
How's it going with your patient?

484
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,990
Still seeing stuff.

485
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,490
I hear house is treating you like crap.

486
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,790
He treats everyone badly.

487
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,690
Yeah,but I heard you're special.

488
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,290
Oh,I can handle it.

489
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,790
Maybe you shouldn't.

490
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,090
He's gonna walk all
over you if you let him.

491
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,390
That says nothing about me, just him.

492
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,190
House respects people
who aren't afraid of him.

493
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,790
Get in his face.

494
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,790
Yell if you have to.

495
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,190
I don't need his respect.

496
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,590
You do if you want the job.

497
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,090
Thanks for the advice.

498
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,890
You have to hold still!

499
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,390
I'm trying!

500
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,290
Damn! Hold her down!

501
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,890
No! Stop it!

502
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,390
Let me do it!

503
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,290
Hold her down!

504
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,790
No! No! No!

505
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,090
no

506
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,990
Irene.

507
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,890
Irene?

508
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,890
You stabbed me.

509
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,490
You were having a nightmare.Wasn't real.

510
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,990
My arm is bleeding.

511
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,290
No,it's okay now.Your arm's not...

512
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,190
Lesions aren't explained by parkinson's.

513
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,890
Any theories?

514
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,290
A ghost got your tongue?

515
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,590
I'm fine.

516
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,390
What about vasculitis?

517
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,490
Mri didn't indicate
any cerebral ischemia.

518
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,290
But she has shown some focal
weakness,urinary retention.

519
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,190
Yes,those are her big mystery symptoms.

520
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,390
Not the hallucinations that
vasculitis doesn't explain.

521
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,590
Unless it's retinal vasculitis.

522
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:09,190
House,this guy may be smart,and I'm
sure he's great to share a beer with.

523
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,390
But if he doesn't know that visual
symptoms are an electrical issue,

524
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,290
not vascular,two separate systems...

525
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,090
So are the banks and the power grid.

526
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,790
But if I don't pay my
bills,my lights go out.

527
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,390
Vasculitis restricts
blood flow to nerves,

528
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,290
messes with electrical function.

529
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,590
Acute intermittent
porphyria's a better fit.

530
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,390
If you're wrong about porphyria,the
treatment could box her kidneys.

531
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,090
Vasculitis is treated
with corticosteriods.

532
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,290
Relatively harmless.

533
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,490
Start her on the steroids.

534
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,490
House,this gu...

535
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,090
And test for both so he'll stop whing.

536
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,190
Big love, have I humiliated
you in the last half hour?

537
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,690
no.

538
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,690
Check your email.

539
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,190
How's it going?

540
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,190
Great.

541
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,990
The only way he could turn any more
cheeks is by pulling down his pants.

542
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,090
He's not a wuss.

543
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,190
It takes a lot more strength...

544
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,590
Hey,we didn't bet on how strong he was.

545
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,190
So you're gonna collect $100 and
fire him because he has principles?

546
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,490
What's your agenda here?

547
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,390
Obviously don't care about the $100.

548
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,190
He's a decent, smart...

549
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,290
You don't care about the team.

550
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,690
Does it annoy wilson when you ask
questions and ignore the answers?

551
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,190
Very much.

552
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,990
You only care about who
I hire and who I fire,

553
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,290
'cause you miss going through my mail.

554
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,090
You can't stop controlling me.

555
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,690
No one controls you.

556
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,290
- Want your job back?
- no.

557
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,290
Too bad.You can't have it.

558
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,690
She'll take care of this.

559
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,990
You can take it out of the
$100 you're gonna owe me.

560
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,790
I met house at a conference
about five years ago.

561
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,090
He's quite a character.

562
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,890
Yes,he is.

563
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,590
Probably one of the best
medical minds of our generation.

564
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,090
I agree. I learned
an awful lot from him.

565
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,490
I'll bet you did.

566
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,790
I see here,just did a
stint at mercy. Great.

567
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,990
It says here "'07 to present."

568
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,190
How long were you there?

569
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,390
About a month.

570
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,590
Dr. Schaffer was great, but
just wasn't the right fit.

571
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,790
Wait,was that you with Dr.
Schaffer and the lymphoma patient?

572
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,190
It was,um,it was a tough situation.

573
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,590
I probably could've handled it better.

574
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,590
No. Dr. Schaffer's got
a stick up her rear.

575
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,290
Good for you.

576
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,890
What made you so sure it was lymphoma?

577
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,790
There was an unusual lactic
acid level in one of her labs.

578
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,690
I had a similar case a few months ago.

579
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,990
Beautiful.

580
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,690
God,I wish I had your stones.

581
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,590
Well,my stones areon the market.

582
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,790
No,I mean,seriously, I
wish I had your stones.

583
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,890
Then I could cram you down
the board of directors.

584
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,190
But I don't.

585
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,690
I'm sorry,man.

586
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,190
Good luck.

587
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,090
When your retina sees something,they
send electrical signals to your brain.

588
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,590
These lenses will pick up those signals.

589
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,090
If the signals are misfiring,

590
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,690
it'll confirm that an old man without a
medical license is smarter than all of us.

591
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,190
That your hallucinations
were caused by...

592
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,090
They're not hallucinations.

593
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,290
Tell her,mom.

594
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,490
Honey,they're doctors.

595
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,490
They must know what they're doing.

596
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,890
If they know what they're doing,how'd
they kill that poor man's dog?

597
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,590
Come on,this has got to be
freaking you out a little bit.

598
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,390
I appreciate your concern.

599
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,190
There's nothing to be ashamed of here.

600
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,190
If the ghost of a man you killed
doesn't screw with your head,

601
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,190
there's something wrong with your head.

602
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,590
See,that freaks me out.

603
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,890
Someone must've left it in here.

604
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,490
Oh,absolutely.That makes sense.

605
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,190
The dog was in here getting his eyes
checkedand forgot to put his jewelry back on.

606
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,590
This isn't working.

607
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,390
You're just making me
sicker like he said you...

608
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,990
What's wrong?

609
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,690
My stomach,it hurts.

610
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,190
- Code in the eye lab.
- Lean forward,irene.

611
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,090
You're gonna aspirate.

612
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,890
I can't. It hurts.

613
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,390
Why won't you help me?

614
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,290
Spleen's ripe to bursting.

615
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,190
You guys thought it was vasculitis?

616
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,690
You used to be on house's team,right?

617
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,090
Yeah.

618
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,290
There's a lot of blood in here. Sponge.

619
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,390
You got any advice for me?

620
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,190
Nope.

621
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,090
Did you always put up with his crap?

622
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,990
Yup.

623
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,390
Was it a mistake?

624
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,490
It was irrelevant.

625
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,990
He fired you.

626
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,690
He'll fire you either way...

627
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,790
Eventually.

628
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,990
Dr. Cameron told me...

629
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,090
No,no,no.

630
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,890
Why not?

631
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,290
'cause...

632
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,890
House is watching.

633
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,790
Not a metaphor.Look up.

634
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,590
You guys gonna shoot the breeze or you
gonna do something about all that bleeding?

635
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,290
That's not coming from the spleen.

636
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,090
It's the liver.

637
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,090
It's necrotic.

638
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,990
She's dying from the inside out.

639
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,090
Enlarged spleen and liver
failure are classic a.i.p.

640
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,490
It's porphyria and it's moving fast.

641
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,890
Pbgs were negative...

642
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,990
If you read the report.

643
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,890
Pbg tests are only conclusive
if done during an attack,

644
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,290
which you would know if
you were a real doctor.

645
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,890
That is just great.

646
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,490
- What is?
- Which one of us is?

647
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,690
Both of you.Together.

648
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,890
Fighting.

649
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,790
Passionate to prove the other one wrong.

650
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,590
Couldn't care less about the patient,

651
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,990
but it all works out the same.

652
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,390
I hate thirteen.

653
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,090
Not as productively.

654
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,790
Continue.

655
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,890
It could still be vascular.

656
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,790
Vasculitis is off the board.

657
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,390
Steroid treatment didn't help.

658
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,290
Vascular isn't just vasculitis.

659
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,690
Something's gotta be cutting off the
blood supply to her liver and spleen.

660
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,090
Do a visceral angiogram.

661
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,890
This is a joke,right?

662
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,490
He can't be right every single time.

663
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,390
You're feeding him your
ideas just to embarrass us.

664
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,190
If I wanted to embarrass you, i'd
have you mop up the doctor's lounge.

665
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,290
Heavenly father,

666
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,190
I pray thee that thou shalt
give the holy ghost unto all them

667
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,590
that shall believe in their words.

668
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,790
Irene.

669
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,490
What are you doing?

670
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,890
I need to touch it.

671
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,890
Irene,put your hand down.

672
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,090
No,give it to me!

673
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,290
I want it!

674
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,590
Give it to me!

675
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,490
What'd the angio say?

676
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,190
We couldn't finish.She
started groping me.

677
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,990
You couldn't let her get to second
base just to get the test done?

678
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,290
I think that's third base.

679
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,290
She was convulsing,delirious,
and hyper-salivating.

680
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,690
We had to knock her out with lorazepam.

681
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,090
Well,it's definitely not vascular.

682
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,990
What do you want us to do?

683
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,790
Question is what would joseph smith do?

684
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,890
This isn't the time for...

685
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,990
Casting out the demons?

686
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,790
The patient's not possessed.she's dying.

687
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,990
you can mock me tomorrow.

688
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,490
you believe that the
book has all the answers.

689
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,190
to morality. Not science.

690
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,990
but the book is
inconsistent with science.

691
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,090
you know how many epileptics were
tortured because they were possessed?

692
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:45,090
how many teenage witches were stoned
to death 'cause they took mushrooms?

693
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,490
just shut up already!

694
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,490
we got a patient dying!

695
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,590
either got to prescribe an exorcism or
admit to me that smith was a horny fraud.

696
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,390
I know what she has.

697
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,490
you couldn't have spoken
up ten seconds ago?

698
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,290
you could have saved me 100 bucks.

699
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,790
mushrooms weren't the only thing
that got people stoned to death.

700
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,490
jimson weed,belladonna,
mandrake root,and moldy bread.

701
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,590
it's ergot poisoning.

702
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,890
you'd need damp grain that had been...

703
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,090
completely unprocessed
and untreated like

704
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,290
what's in that organic rye
bread she's been eating.

705
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,190
should I be going home?

706
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,090
is it 6:00?

707
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,090
it's why she got worse
on the bromocriptine...

708
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,190
it's an ergot derivative.

709
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,890
there hasn't been a case in 50 years.

710
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,990
she kept asking for milk.

711
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,390
dairy products counteract the effects.

712
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,190
you think she knew what
she had and was treating it?

713
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,290
cravings based on actual needs.

714
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:41,090
it's a fairly common
evolutionary development.

715
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,690
you okay with an answer
based on evolution?

716
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,090
yeah.

717
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,890
hypocrite.

718
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,390
it's the stuff they make lsd from.

719
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,590
the treatment you're on should...

720
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,490
so I've just been... Tripping?

721
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,290
it explains the hallucinations,
seizures,delusions.

722
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,390
constricts the blood vessels,
which explains the necrosis.

723
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,490
she's not here?

724
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,590
i'm sorry. No.

725
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,690
the fact that you're even
willing to accept that answer

726
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,890
means the medicine is starting to work.

727
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,690
but you'll live.

728
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,390
you're beautiful,reena.

729
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,490
you too,mama.

730
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,290
i'm going to Miss you.

731
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,390
ma.

732
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,890
as you know, there
are seven of you and...

733
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,190
only six roses.

734
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,990
those are peonies.

735
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,190
but I'm sure they're
part of the rose family.

736
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,090
actually,I'm surprised
there are seven of you.

737
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,590
you punch your boss and stick around?

738
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,990
give me the flower and shut up.

739
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,090
don't overdo it.

740
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,890
now I would love to keep all of you.

741
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,490
but not enough to do anything about it.

742
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,090
so according to my arbitrary schedule,

743
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,690
one of you has to go.

744
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,090
you're kidding.

745
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,390
I came up with the answer.

746
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,090
I robbed a grave. I...

747
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:10,490
planted a dog collar in the procedure
room just to screw with my head.

748
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,190
no,I never...

749
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,490
you don't believe she did it?

750
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,290
i'm sure she did it.

751
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,890
that's why she's getting the flower.

752
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,990
it was beautiful.

753
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,590
she just overreached.

754
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,490
she got into your head.

755
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,290
no.

756
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,090
she owned you.

757
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,090
planting the idea was good.

758
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,890
letting it fester was good.

759
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,690
leaving the collar was stupid.

760
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,290
well known fact, ghosts don't
leave things lying around.

761
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,890
so am I gone then?

762
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,090
oh,my goodness.

763
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,990
I had totally forgotten about you two.

764
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,390
well played.

765
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,190
sorry,henry.

766
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,690
we had some giggles.

767
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,990
you agreed with everything he said.

768
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,490
you finished each other's sentences.

769
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,390
that's why I gotta go.

770
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,890
don't need someone to tell you
what you're already thinking.

771
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,290
funny,I was gonna say that.

772
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,690
if you want to hang out...

773
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,790
yeah,I know.

774
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,290
um,call wilson.

775
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,190
rest of you, 8:00 tomorrow.

776
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,490
cash will be fine.

777
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,190
I bet you say that to all the guys.

778
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,990
take your blood money.

779
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,290
who are you gonna protect next?

780
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,690
if I told you, it wouldn't work.

781
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,390
I've rethought some things.

782
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,590
glad to hear it.

783
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,390
i'm prepared to come back
on a number of conditions.

784
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,290
I want the raise you
promised, plus five percent.

785
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,190
I want my own office
and a personal assistant.

786
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,390
it's not unreasonable.

787
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,390
I will give you...none of those.

788
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,990
you can come back at
your original salary.

789
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,890
what's going on?

790
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,690
you haven't rethought anything.
you've just been blackballed.

791
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,990
you're "house light" now.

792
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,990
the only administrator that will touch
you is the one who hired "house classic."

793
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,890
good news is, she'll pretend
she's not doing you a favor.

794
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,990
I can start monday.
