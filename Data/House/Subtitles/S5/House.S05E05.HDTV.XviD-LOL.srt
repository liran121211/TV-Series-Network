1
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
wow.

2
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,500
Yeah.

3
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,100
Come back to bed.

4
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,800
Gimme a minute.

5
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,100
You get 20 seconds.

6
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,300
Hey, what are you-

7
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,300
Female, late 20s,
tonic clonic seizure.

8
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,300
Duration of the seizure?

9
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,800
A little over three minutes.

10
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,500
Does your friend have
a history of epilepsy?

11
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,600
She never said.

12
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
My name is Dr. Cameron.
You're in a hospital.

13
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
We're gonna take care of you.

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,400
<i>- what's her name?
- I don't know.</i>

15
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,900
<i>house.</i>

16
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,100
eh.

17
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,300
I have a case I think
you might be interested in.

18
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,400
Not now.

19
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,100
A 26-year-old woman
had a tonic clonic seizure.

20
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,700
What about me speeding away

21
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,500
says to you "let's chat"?

22
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,000
History of fatigue,
and two years ago

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,300
she had a retinal
vein occlusion.

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,700
She's diabetic.

25
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,600
No, she's not.

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000
And she has no history
of hypertension.

27
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,600
It can wait.

28
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,100
I knew I should've set up
a video camera.

29
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,200
Stay there.

30
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,100
Oh, my goodness.

31
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,700
I played a practical joke
on my best friend,

32
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,600
and he's badly injured.

33
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,500
I wish I had learned
this valuable lesson earlier.

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,100
<i>I was waiting by my window
for an hour.</i>

35
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,000
Why are you late?

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,500
I had a breakfast meeting
at mickey's diner

37
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,600
with the mercy people

38
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,700
to tell them...

39
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,700
I'm coming back
to work here.

40
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,400
Sorry if it interfered

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,500
with your plan
to maim me.

42
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,100
Donut's a nice touch.

43
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,900
It's just a way of saying
"welcome back."

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,800
The seizure could be
the result of dehydration

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,400
or something neurological.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,100
Or the ecstasy you found
in her system.

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,000
According to Dr. Hadley,

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,800
the patient took the drugs

49
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,200
about five hours
before the seizure, so.

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
What does thirteen know
about it?

51
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,400
Uh, apparently she was
with the patient last night.

52
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,600
At 3:00 a.m.?

53
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,800
Oh, yeah.

54
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,800
<i>Penthouse forum meets
medical mystery.</i>

55
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,100
Maybe there is a god.

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,800
Empty transient sex?

57
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,100
I've been waiting for you

58
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
to spiral out of control

59
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,800
ever since you got
your huntington's diagnosis,

60
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,600
but this is more
than I dared hope for.

61
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,400
Patient's seizure resulted
from dehydration,

62
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,800
which resulted from a cocktail
of alcohol and ecstasy.

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,600
<i>Mystery solved.</i>

64
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,000
Wait.
Were you doing drugs?

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,400
Not diagnostically relevant.

66
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,300
<i>Depends what
we're trying to diagnose.</i>

67
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,300
It's how steep of a spiral
you're on.

68
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,700
Our patient hemorrhaged
into her eye two years ago.

69
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,100
Also not diagnostically
relevant.

70
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,400
Retinal vein occlusion
was fixed.

71
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,900
Her doctor said it was
a venous anomaly.

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,000
<i>Is he in this room?</i>

73
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,700
<i>because if he's not,</i>

74
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,000
<i>i don't care what he thinks.</i>

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Unless he's a she

76
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,100
and she was
there last night too,

77
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,900
in which case
I care very deeply.

78
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,400
<i>What if the eye problem
wasn't with her vein,</i>

79
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,200
but with her blood?

80
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Would explain why she seized,
why she's always tired.

81
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,300
She parties till 3:00 a.m.

82
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,400
That's why she's always tired.

83
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,600
Yet you seem fine.

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,000
She's visited four other doctors
in the past year.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,400
None of them found anything.

86
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
She's a hypochondriac
who drank too much.

87
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
Blood clots could explain
everything.

88
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,200
<i>Makes sense.</i>

89
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,500
Bone marrow's in overdrive.
Too many platelets.

90
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,300
Sorry.

91
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,500
Thirteen,

92
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,300
go stick a needle

93
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,200
in your girlfriend's pelvis.

94
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,300
And no, that one wasn't
a metaphor.

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,700
Suck out some marrow.

96
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
That one was.

97
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,800
I like to watch.

98
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,900
<i>I can handle this alone.</i>

99
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,500
You've already handled it.

100
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,700
That's why you need
a chaperone.

101
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,300
Of course,
i'm a very permissive,

102
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,900
understanding chaperone.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,800
So feel free to ignore me.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,500
You know, if you're
in the mood to start kissing,

105
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,200
<i>or groping,
or showering.</i>

106
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,600
You'll have to excuse
dr. House.

107
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,700
He mistakes immaturity
for edginess.

108
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,900
You're Dr. House?

109
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,100
I assume my name came up
last night

110
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,600
in the form of a moan.

111
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,300
<i>You had sex, then a seizure.</i>

112
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,600
Could be a particular
position or activity

113
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
that set it off.

114
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,500
That sounds like a valid
medical theory, doesn't it?

115
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,200
I'm really sorry.
Just ignore him.

116
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,700
Whatever you think we did,
we-we did.

117
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,900
<i>And then some.</i>

118
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,000
Lights on or off?

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,100
Do you have a medical
rationalization for that one?

120
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,200
Light sensitivity.

121
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
on.

122
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,100
<i>Huh.</i>

123
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,700
Figured she had more shame
than that.

124
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,800
<i>Did she talk dirty,
or did you rely</i>

125
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,700
on vague hand signals?

126
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,600
She's, uh, pretty direct
about what she wants.

127
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,400
I'm learning so much.

128
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,100
Okay, score the score.

129
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,300
<i>Scale of one to ten.</i>

130
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,100
Don't answer.

131
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
Seven.

132
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,600
Finally got one right.

133
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,700
You want to investigate him

134
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,100
because he ate a donut?

135
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,200
He claimed he had
a morning meeting

136
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,300
at mickey's diner.

137
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,600
Wilson loves mickey's diner.

138
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,000
He has the french toast tower

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,400
whenever he sets foot
in the door.

140
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,700
There's no way he would've come
to work

141
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,100
wanting more carbs.

142
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
He lied to me.

143
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
I need to know why.

144
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
What do you think
you'll find out?

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm worried
that he might be a spy.

146
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,300
He's been gone four months.

147
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
??? The friendship
has changed.

148
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
I'm just not sure
if he's working

149
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,600
for hirohito
or the new england patriots.

150
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,100
You played a practical joke
on him.

151
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,800
He didn't laugh.

152
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,300
I need something
to lord over him, a lie-

153
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,500
He didn't try to retaliate.

154
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,700
He moralized.

155
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,100
He always moralized.

156
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,500
He always moralized
and got even.

157
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,900
He hasn't fired back.

158
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,500
Things always change.

159
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,700
And that sucks.

160
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,600
Yeah.

161
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,400
Find out where he was.

162
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,600
Should've known
it wasn't a coincidence.

163
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,100
Found your letters.

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,300
You recognized house's name.

165
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,400
And you're the first patient
I've seen

166
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,600
who actually enjoyed
being accosted by him.

167
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,100
I would've told you, but-

168
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,600
<i>What exactly would you
have told me?</i>

169
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
that you slept with me
to get to house?

170
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
That you've been trying
to get him

171
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,900
to take your case
for over a year?

172
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,500
I'm sick.

173
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,100
No one even wrote back.

174
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,300
You used me.

175
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,700
- You use me.
- My motives were clear.

176
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
You might've figured out
my motives faster

177
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,000
if you bothered to ask my name.

178
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,300
I followed you to that bar

179
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,400
because I wanted to talk
to you.

180
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,600
<i>See if you'd help me get
to house.</i>

181
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,900
I didn't expect you to be
so aggressive.

182
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,200
Was that seizure even real?

183
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,900
Why would I fake a symptom?

184
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,300
It would just make it harder
for house to diagnose me.

185
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,400
There's nothing to diagnose.

186
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,100
Your biopsy results
are negative.

187
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Then it's something else.

188
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:09,700
Get dressed.

189
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm discharging you.

190
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,300
House admitted me.

191
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,500
He obviously thinks-

192
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,700
<i>House is using you
as an excuse</i>

193
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,600
to stick his nose
in my personal life.

194
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,500
<i>I'm tired all the time.</i>

195
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,000
Some nights I fall asleep
at 10:00

196
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,700
and wake up at noon,
still tired.

197
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,600
<i>Every doctor I see</i>

198
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,300
tells me
there's nothing wrong.

199
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,900
<i>And that proves what,
exactly?</i>

200
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,700
that they're wrong,
or that you're wrong?

201
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,400
Oh, come on.
You expect me to believe-

202
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,100
Sit back.

203
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Deep breaths.
Try and relax.

204
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,700
Get the paddles.

205
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,900
She's gonna crash.

206
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,200
Damn.

207
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,900
We had to use paddles

208
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,600
to stabilize
the patient's heart.

209
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
Eye issue, brain issue,

210
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,100
now a heart issue.

211
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,300
Sounds like a real case
to me.

212
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,600
Yeah, I get it.
I was wrong.

213
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Can we move on?

214
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,700
You're just upset

215
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,000
because the whole time
she was with you,

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,200
she was thinking
of my huge, throbbing...

217
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,200
Diagnostic skills.

218
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,100
Drugs would explain everything.

219
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,500
This morning,
you rejected drugs.

220
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,100
That's when I thought
that thirteen was right

221
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,000
and was just
jerking her around.

222
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,500
Cardiac arrest means

223
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,300
she could be
a serious user.

224
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,500
Great.

225
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,500
What?

226
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,300
That means that something
she did at my place

227
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
set this off.

228
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,600
Either she brought drugs in,

229
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,500
or she grabbed something
from my medicine cabinet.

230
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,000
And that means my place
needs to be searched.

231
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,800
Now, I'd be happy
to do that myself,

232
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
but unfortunately that would be
far less titillating

233
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,600
for house,
so he's about to come up

234
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,100
<i>with some convoluted
medical reason</i>

235
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,300
why I have to stay here
while he goes through my stuff.

236
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Patient's dad
had bypass surgery.

237
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,200
Means she's a candidate
for atherosclerosis.

238
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,600
She needs an ultrasound.

239
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,400
That was much less convoluted
than what you just said.

240
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,300
I'm not giving you my keys.

241
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,700
If you want to do this,
i'm going.

242
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,300
Who could pick a lock?

243
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,700
I'll go.

244
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,100
Make sure he doesn't steal
any underwear.

245
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,900
<i>You're a disgrace
to your stereotype.</i>

246
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,300
Move over.

247
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,400
Think you can pick a lock
faster than me?

248
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,700
No need to pick.

249
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,300
Nice.

250
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,300
Steal from your employees.

251
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,300
Never.

252
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,400
I had my dick make keys

253
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,600
when I hired him
to dick up the team.

254
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,000
Always imagined she'd have
a sex swing

255
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
in the living room.

256
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,100
Give me my key.

257
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,300
Don't have your key.

258
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,600
You expect me to believe
that you hired lucas

259
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
to investigate everyone
except for me?

260
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,600
Waste of money.

261
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,400
I already know everything
about you.

262
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,200
Thirteen had her purse.

263
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,500
That's gotta be the patient's.

264
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,700
Check it for drugs.

265
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,500
I call shotgun
on the bedroom.

266
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,800
You know that I stole a car
when I was a teenager.

267
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
<i>You know that my mom</i>

268
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,700
has alzheimer's.

269
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,900
You know nothing else.

270
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,600
<i>Want me to have you
investigated?</i>

271
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,800
when did you get so needy?

272
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,600
<i>Not needy.</i>

273
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,900
<i>Just don't buy it.</i>

274
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,800
<i>You always want
more information about people.</i>

275
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Look where we are.

276
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,000
<i>Purse is clean.</i>

277
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,900
Last night wasn't
the first time

278
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,700
that thirteen brought home
some strange.

279
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,800
If you found her diary-

280
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,100
No toys.

281
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,100
<i>You sleep with the same person
over and over,</i>

282
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,600
that's when you need
accessories.

283
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,800
<i>First time is plenty exciting
on its own.</i>

284
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,200
Unless...

285
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,700
You think an asthma inhaler

286
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,700
could be used
as a sex toy?

287
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
There are ways of getting
to know people

288
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
without committing felonies.

289
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,800
People interest me.

290
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
Conversations don't.

291
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,100
Because conversations
go both ways.

292
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,600
- Like thirteen.
- Like thirteen.

293
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,000
Brown recluse.

294
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,400
Found it at your apartment.

295
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Their venom can cause
seizures and heart problems.

296
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,300
Unless the ultrasound
showed anything-

297
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,100
<i>No.</i>

298
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,400
What room did you find it in?

299
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
<i>Bathroom.</i>

300
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,000
Nice bidet, by the way.
Very refreshing.

301
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,300
I don't have a bidet.

302
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,300
oh.

303
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,300
<i>Spider's not the only</i>

304
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,100
interesting thing I found.

305
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,300
Yeah, my inhaler is fascinating.

306
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,900
It's got its own extensive
online following.

307
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,100
You have asthma?

308
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,600
When I was a kid.

309
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,800
<i>It started acting up again
when I moved into my new place.</i>

310
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
You moved?

311
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,300
- Who cares?
- He doesn't.

312
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,000
He's just surprised
he didn't know.

313
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,300
You withhold things

314
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,100
other people
would never bother to.

315
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,900
The move,
a little wheeze,

316
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,200
whatever you thought
was in my pocket

317
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,300
instead of your inhaler.

318
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,000
Maybe I should make
a return trip to your place.

319
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,700
<i>Spider bite doesn't explain
anything</i>

320
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,600
unless the patient
was actually bitten by a spider.

321
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,700
I'll do the exam.

322
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
<i>Don't be ridiculous.
That would be inappropriate.</i>

323
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,400
It'd be better if a woman
gropes her.

324
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,400
There's no sexual tension
that way.

325
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
I need you to stand up
and take off your gown.

326
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,800
I think I would've felt
a spider biting me.

327
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,300
Not necessarily.

328
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,200
You really need those
after everything

329
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,600
we did the other night?

330
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,600
The other night
I wasn't your doctor.

331
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,700
How long are you
gonna stay mad at me?

332
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,400
How long are you going
to be here?

333
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,800
oh.

334
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,100
Okay, then.

335
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,300
Look...

336
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
I really had no intention

337
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,300
of ever seeing you again.

338
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,400
So...

339
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,300
Having me end up here

340
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,500
is a little less
than ideal.

341
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,400
I get it.

342
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,300
But... We just met.

343
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,600
How'd you know you didn't want
to see me again?

344
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,300
It's nothing personal.

345
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,500
I'm just really not that into
repeat performances.

346
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,000
<i>I figured I wasn't
the first girl you cruised.</i>

347
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,300
Why is that?

348
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
You're awfully good at it.

349
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,200
You'd think with all that
experience

350
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,500
that I'd be better
than a seven.

351
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,000
We just met.

352
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,800
We were both drunk.

353
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,100
Not like
there wasn't potential.

354
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,800
Little more practice
for the both of us,

355
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,400
i'd say we're looking
at a nine.

356
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,700
Easy.

357
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,100
But that would require
a repeat performance.

358
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
You didn't have to move
your hand.

359
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,700
I didn't.

360
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
My hand's on your hip.

361
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,300
You don't feel that?

362
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,800
no.

363
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,800
What does that mean?

364
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,600
It means it's not
a spider bite.

365
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,900
Blood test confirms
low potassium levels.

366
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,600
Explains the numbness
in her hip.

367
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,400
It's not good,
but I think we've got time

368
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,600
for at least one
or two comments

369
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,700
about my personal life.

370
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,800
Which you just wasted

371
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,500
with that comment
about my comments.

372
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,500
Low potassium means
her heart problem

373
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,200
was a symptom
of a kidney problem.

374
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,500
What caused the kidney problem?

375
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,900
Could be i.g.a. Nephropathy.

376
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,400
Not without blood
in the urine.

377
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,600
P.s.a.g.n.?

378
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,200
Not with normal blood pressure.

379
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,100
Renal tubular acidosis.

380
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,100
<i>Her kidney's don't filter acid
out of the blood.</i>

381
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,600
<i>Excess acid
drives down potassium,</i>

382
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,400
<i>causes kidney calcifications.</i>

383
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,900
If it's rta,

384
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,500
<i>all she needs is sodium
bicarbonate for the acid</i>

385
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,900
<i>and surgery to remove
the calcifications.</i>

386
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Ct her kidneys.

387
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,400
If you find calcifications,

388
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,900
we have our diagnosis.

389
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,400
<i>What's he doing now?</i>

390
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,900
he's playing
that carjacking video game.

391
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,800
He'd get a lot farther
if he didn't stop

392
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
at all the red lights.

393
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,000
Maybe he was doing something

394
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
he thinks I'll mock him for.

395
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,400
Like...

396
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,200
Just about anything.

397
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
You don't think it's that.

398
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,700
I don't think
it's just about anything?

399
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,500
You don't think
it's about anything trivial.

400
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,800
If you weren't worried,

401
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,200
<i>you wouldn't be sitting
in my car.</i>

402
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,800
Maybe he's seeing a shrink.

403
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,800
<i>That does not look
like a pizza delivery.</i>

404
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,900
<i>Doesn't matter if it isn't.</i>

405
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,400
<i>Wilson doesn't buy his pizza.</i>

406
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,700
There's eight units
in this building.

407
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,800
There's got to be a pervert
like me

408
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,400
living in
at least one of them.

409
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,300
Yes, because you represent
one out of every eight people

410
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,600
living in this country.

411
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,100
<i>Apparently he has developed
a taste for pizza.</i>

412
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Ah, things change.

413
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,500
Ct shows one more calcification

414
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,400
near the superior pyramid
on the left kidney.

415
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,400
See it.

416
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,800
That, um, thing
you were hoping

417
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,500
house didn't find
at your place.

418
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,600
I, uh, I found it.

419
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,400
He did the cag test
two weeks ago.

420
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,700
A number this high

421
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,600
means you have less time
than you thought.

422
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,300
It's understandable
you'd be upset.

423
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,200
Doesn't mean
you have to self-destruct.

424
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,900
It's not noble for you
to protect me from house

425
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,800
if you're just gonna judge-

426
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
There are things
you should be doing.

427
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,500
Working out, improving balance
and coordination.

428
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,300
Yeah, that sounds
like a blast.

429
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,800
I'm having fun.

430
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,300
Cramming as much life
into my life as I can.

431
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,200
You're doing drugs.

432
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,400
Staying up all night,
having sex with strangers.

433
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,900
It sounds fun to me.

434
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Good night.

435
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,400
Close the incisions.

436
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,800
She won't even have
a scar.

437
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,400
Her o2 stats are dropping.

438
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Did you nick something?

439
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,900
Procedure was clean.
Bp's strong.

440
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,000
Well, she's not breathing.
We need to intubate.

441
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,400
The breathing problem started

442
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,500
after we fixed
her kidney problem.

443
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
Means the rta
isn't the underlying cause.

444
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,700
Where's thirteen?

445
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,400
Traffic's bad.
She's probably just-

446
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,800
Not here.

447
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,600
<i>It's not her lungs.</i>

448
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,500
No masses, no infiltrates.

449
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,200
Lungs are working,
but she still can't breathe.

450
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,800
Distribution plant
can't distribute

451
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,100
if it's not getting
deliveries.

452
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,900
If her lungs are fine,

453
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,400
maybe the problem's
in the supply line.

454
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,100
Airway collapse.

455
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,300
<i>That could signal autoimmune</i>

456
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,600
or some kind of dystrophy
as the underlying cause.

457
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,700
There's only one way
to find out

458
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,200
if her airway failed.

459
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,400
<i>Make it happen again.</i>

460
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,100
Stick thirteen's
carpet cleaner on a treadmill.

461
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,000
Methacholine challenge.

462
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,500
And someone find the carpet.

463
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Exam going on.
15 minutes.

464
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,800
Good morning,
dr. Hadley.

465
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,200
Just spoke to my brother.

466
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,200
And by brother,
you mean?

467
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,700
I mean my parents'
other son.

468
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,800
wow.
Same dad.

469
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
got a call last week
from your p.i.

470
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,700
You lied.

471
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,300
You did have me investigated.

472
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,800
You've been taunting the team

473
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,500
with what you've learned,

474
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,200
but you never came after me.

475
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,400
Means you couldn't find
anything.

476
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,200
You're right.

477
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,900
<i>That's because</i>

478
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,800
you haven't done anything
stupid, spontaneous,

479
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,400
or even vaguely interesting
since you were 17.

480
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,900
And that's just sad.

481
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I found her in the clinic

482
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,900
giving herself iv fluids.

483
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,200
<i>At least you could've
let her finish.</i>

484
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
She looks terrible.

485
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,700
She has a fresh nightclub stamp

486
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,700
on her wrist.

487
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
She's in no condition
to practice.

488
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,800
Unless this is a prelude
to an actual spanking,

489
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,900
there's no reason
for me to be-

490
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,400
I want her to take
a drug test.

491
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,700
You can't make me do that.

492
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,000
But I can suspend you
until you do.

493
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,300
Because she went to a nightclub
in her free time?

494
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,300
Or because she had sex
in her free time?

495
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,500
Patient was undergoing
routine surgery

496
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,300
for rta.

497
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,700
Didn't need thirteen here
for that.

498
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,300
And I don't need you
making my employees

499
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,200
punch a clock
or pee in a cup.

500
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,100
Let's go.

501
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Come on.

502
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,800
Thank you.

503
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,500
By the way,

504
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,300
the surgery was not routine.

505
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Patient stopped breathing

506
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,500
and you missed
a differential.

507
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,000
You're fired.

508
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,900
What?

509
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,600
You just defended me.

510
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,400
No, I just prevented you
from getting a drug test.

511
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,900
Probably saved your career.

512
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,100
I'm already taking
responsibility

513
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,700
for one doctor
with a drug habit.

514
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,400
I don't have a drug habit.

515
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,300
The slutty party girl
is fun

516
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,300
till she pukes
on your shoes.

517
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,300
Then she's just a pain
in the ass.

518
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,200
I haven't sat on this couch
for four months.

519
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,600
It remembers my cheeks.

520
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,300
I Miss this.

521
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,200
Me too.

522
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,900
Me trying to work.

523
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,200
You interrupting.

524
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,000
Oh, come on.

525
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,900
Your patients could wait
five minutes.

526
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,100
Get me caught up.

527
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Come on,
what did you do?

528
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,000
Travel?

529
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,400
Did you get a new hobby?

530
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,500
Did you meet someone?

531
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,500
Actually, yes.

532
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:39,300
I sort of started dating
someone.

533
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,700
Great.

534
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,100
What does she do?

535
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,500
Is she... An actress?

536
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,700
no.

537
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,900
Why would you think that?

538
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
I just figured you'd

539
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,700
want something
a little more...

540
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:54,900
Exciting.

541
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,100
She's not...

542
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,200
You're gonna find out anyway

543
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
because you're gonna meet her.

544
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,800
She's... A prostitute.

545
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,500
Used to be.

546
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,700
She made some mistakes.

547
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,600
Single mom,
had some drug issues.

548
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,500
But...
She's so smart.

549
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,000
She wants to go to law school.

550
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
And... I told her
i'd help her

551
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,700
with tuition.

552
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,600
How long have you known her?

553
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,700
Oh, I knew you'd be like this.

554
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,900
I asked a question.

555
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,300
House...

556
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,800
You are a drug addict.

557
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,000
You go to prostitutes.

558
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,300
You can't be judgmental.

559
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,100
And yet.

560
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,800
Please, don't do this to me.

561
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,700
I was hurting,
and I wanted to feel good.

562
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,700
I didn't expect it

563
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,000
to go this way.

564
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,100
i...

565
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,400
Amber...

566
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,500
Said that she wanted me
to move on.

567
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,000
That she wanted me to...

568
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,400
Be happy.

569
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
And...

570
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,200
Debbie makes me happy.

571
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,700
If you're happy, I'm...

572
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,300
I heard.

573
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,700
Yeah.

574
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,600
I'm looking
for my ticket back.

575
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,700
Sorry if I upset you.

576
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,500
I didn't want to invade
your privacy.

577
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,600
It wasn't your fault.

578
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,100
Can you get me caught up?

579
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,800
Think you're gonna find
something we didn't?

580
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,400
It's good for the patient.

581
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
Good for me.

582
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,900
Films are clean.

583
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,200
we ruled out hypertension.

584
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,700
Guys have her on a treadmill

585
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,600
<i>running
a methacholine challenge.</i>

586
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,200
And I still think you've been
acting like an idiot.

587
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,000
I know.

588
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,200
Did you talk
about whether this lung field

589
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,300
looks a little dark?

590
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,600
It's probably just
over-exposed.

591
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,700
Or her diaphragm's
a little flat.

592
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,200
Could be a sign
of hyperinflation.

593
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,900
Suggests a pulmonary
obstruction.

594
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,300
Lung cysts.

595
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,300
They wouldn't show up
on an x-ray.

596
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,700
Treadmill test
isn't gonna close her airway.

597
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,400
It'll make her lungs
explode.

598
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,000
Her throat's fine.

599
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,500
We made her airway collapse,

600
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,300
but it's not collapsed.

601
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,800
You ruptured a cyst!

602
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,200
<i>Her lung collapsed.</i>

603
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,900
Breath sounds on both sides.

604
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:25,900
Move.

605
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,300
Trachea's deviating
to the left.

606
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Nice.

607
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,500
<i>Chest ct confirmed
multiple lung cysts,</i>

608
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,200
<i>one of which burst
during the treadmill test.</i>

609
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,600
Luckily, thirteen figured out

610
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,700
<i>the problem and was there
to re-inflate her lung.</i>

611
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,200
<i>Lung cysts plus
all her other symptoms</i>

612
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,000
<i>could be amyloidosis,</i>

613
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,800
which we can manage.

614
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,400
Or pulmonary fibrosis which-

615
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,300
Thank you.

616
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,000
My employees can take
care of it from here.

617
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,900
We need to biopsy the cysts.

618
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,500
You fired me

619
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,400
because I screwed up.

620
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,300
I just proved I can pull
my weight.

621
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,500
All you proved is you know
how to make an entrance.

622
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,400
<i>House, she deserves
another shot.</i>

623
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,000
She found the cysts,
saved the patient.

624
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,100
<i>Who wouldn't have needed
saving</i>

625
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,000
if thirteen had shown up

626
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,700
at the differential
in the first place.

627
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,900
Give her
her job back, house.

628
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,900
Or what?

629
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,900
You're gonna quit?

630
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,800
Go do the biopsy.

631
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,000
I'm sorry.

632
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,100
How much clearer
do I need to make this?

633
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,000
What does that even mean,
"dating a hooker"?

634
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,700
He's an idiot
with a messiah complex.

635
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,200
Savior to all who need saving.

636
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,100
That's why his first wife
had a wooden leg.

637
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,600
Second wife was canadian.

638
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,600
He's the one who needs
to be saved.

639
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,700
From you or the ho?

640
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,800
The ho's just using him
for his money.

641
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,400
Wait.
Bad example.

642
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,700
Normally in these situations,

643
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
i'd follow the girl,

644
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,900
find out something embarrassing
about her to show him.

645
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,500
But since that's
our starting position...

646
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,700
Proceed directly
to the leg-breaking.

647
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,500
I'm not breaking her legs.

648
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,000
She probably has a pimp.

649
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,400
Or, at least,
an older brother.

650
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,700
Or a younger brother.

651
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,500
Or overprotective sister.

652
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,300
Find her, find her family,

653
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,000
find client number nine.

654
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,200
Just get me something
I can use

655
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,600
to force her to back off.

656
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,500
Sorry to interrupt
your meeting, mannix.

657
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Here's the result
from the lung biopsy.

658
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,500
Why not men?

659
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,900
You're bisexual.

660
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,000
<i>If you were just being
self-destructive,</i>

661
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,100
you'd be having random sex
with men.

662
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,700
<i>Better chance
of getting assaulted,</i>

663
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,100
catching a disease.

664
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,200
If this were
just about getting laid,

665
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,100
it'd be a lot easier
to pick up men.

666
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,200
<i>Or ugly girls.</i>

667
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,000
This woman's hot.

668
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,800
Which means you like
the challenge,

669
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,100
the conquest.

670
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
It's the control
that gets you off.

671
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,300
<i>And controlling women
is as close as you can get</i>

672
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,100
to controlling
what's gonna happen to you.

673
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,800
Here I thought I was just
into boobs.

674
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,800
Instead of getting sweaty
with a stranger,

675
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
why don't you try taking it
to the next level?

676
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Play god.

677
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,400
Tell a girl that she's got
ten years to live.

678
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,700
She has lam.

679
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,300
Okay.

680
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,900
This is not a test.

681
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,900
You're not getting your job back
if you can-

682
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,800
I know what it's like
to get this news,

683
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,000
and no one
should have to get it from you.

684
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,000
hey.

685
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
The biopsy of your lung cyst

686
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
<i>showed smooth muscle cells.</i>

687
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,000
That's indicative
of a disease called lam.

688
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,800
What do you do for that?

689
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,300
Surgery to remove
the cysts.

690
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,700
<i>But...</i>

691
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,300
They'll come back.

692
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,800
Little by little,

693
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,900
the cysts replace
healthy lung tissue

694
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,600
until your lungs stop working.

695
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,300
I'm gonna die.

696
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,700
yes.

697
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,600
I'm so sorry.

698
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,900
They removed all the cysts
they could.

699
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,600
That should help you
breathe better.

700
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,100
How long until the cysts
come back?

701
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,200
We don't know exactly.

702
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I'm sorry.

703
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,400
Stop saying you're sorry.

704
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,300
I know you're scared.

705
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,800
I don't know what I feel.

706
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,300
You're gonna be numb
for a few more days.

707
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,000
Then you'll go home
and cry for a few weeks.

708
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,700
And then you get angry.

709
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,600
Start telling yourself
nothing matters anymore.

710
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,800
You start doing
stupid things.

711
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,100
Maybe you go out to bars

712
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,900
and pick up a bunch
of women.

713
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,400
You're...

714
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,800
How long do you have?

715
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,900
Maybe a little more
than you.

716
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,700
Maybe a little less.

717
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,100
I'll race you.

718
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,200
I was thinking
maybe I'd come back later.

719
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,600
Sounds good.

720
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,500
Oh, god.

721
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,200
What's going on?

722
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,600
All her blood counts are down.
It's a new symptom.

723
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Aplastic anemia.

724
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,800
Does the word "fired"

725
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,800
have some whole

726
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,000
that I'm not aware of?

727
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,900
I don't work for you.
Fine.

728
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:24,700
Don't pay me.

729
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
Just let me finish out
this case.

730
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,400
So you like her
now that she's dying.

731
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,200
What happens
if she stops dying?

732
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,600
<i>There's no danger
of that right now.</i>

733
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,900
If we don't figure out
what's wrong with her,

734
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,400
she's got days,
not years.

735
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,800
<i>Aplastic anemia takes lam</i>

736
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,300
<i>off the table.</i>

737
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,400
<i>Unfortunately, none of our
other choices are any better.</i>

738
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,800
Pnh with some sort
of respiratory infection.

739
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,300
Best case gives her 12 years.

740
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,500
Or fast-moving langerhans.

741
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,400
A few months.

742
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,500
Or mastocytosis,
which can cause systemic shock

743
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,600
and kill her in days.

744
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,600
go.
Test for everything.

745
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,600
Not you.

746
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,500
You're just a visitor.

747
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,200
How's your patient?

748
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,100
She doesn't have langerhans.

749
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,700
That's good.

750
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,200
Actually, a cancer diagnosis

751
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,900
would be good news
right now.

752
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,700
Do you think...

753
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,100
I'm boring?

754
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,300
yes.

755
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,100
You're saying that
just to screw with me.

756
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,400
Yeah.

757
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,700
Why would you expect
anything else?

758
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,300
I expect house to pull
my strings.

759
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,300
I expect cameron
to make me feel better.

760
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,200
I expect the new team
to kiss my ass.

761
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,900
And I expect you to be honest,

762
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,400
'cause you don't give
a crap.

763
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,700
Yes, you're boring.

764
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,900
That speech was boring.

765
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,400
Thanks so much.

766
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,700
You don't let other people's
problems affect you.

767
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,000
<i>You don't let your own</i>

768
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,700
problems affect you.

769
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,000
And it's the screw-ups
that make us interesting.

770
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,500
<i>You're never out of control.</i>

771
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,300
<i>Which is good, and...</i>

772
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,200
Boring.

773
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,500
Never losing control
also means

774
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,600
you're never putting yourself
out there.

775
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,200
Never pushing your limits.

776
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,000
On the other hand,

777
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,600
you do have a tattoo, so...

778
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,300
Maybe I'm wrong.

779
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:18,200

00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,400

795
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,300
she needs
a bone marrow transplant.

796
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,900
Test results are back?
What's she positive for?

797
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,000
Nothing.

798
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,400
But we've got a donor match.

799
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,600
Jumping to a transplant

800
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,400
when we don't know what she-

801
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,000
I know she has
a blood disorder.

802
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,800
Could be pnh.

803
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,300
She needs
a bone marrow transplant.

804
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,100
Or leukemia.

805
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,400
She needs
a bone marrow transplant.

806
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,300
Or thalassemia.

807
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,800
- She needs a bone marrow-
- Yeah, I get it.

808
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
But she'll never survive

809
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,300
total body irradiation.

810
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,800
So we don't radiate her.

811
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,900
Her marrow's nearly wiped out
already.

812
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,000
Counts almost zero.

813
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
"almost" being the key word.

814
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,600
The new marrow would attack
the old marrow.

815
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,500
She'll die
from graft-versus-host.

816
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,700
You got a better idea?

817
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,500
She trusts you.

818
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,300
Go get her consent.

819
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,900
Sometimes I find out things
you'd rather not know.

820
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,600
<i>This was in his trash.</i>

821
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,000
He's using.

822
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,900
You're back.

823
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,300
Genius.

824
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,500
Damn.

825
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,700
I knew the fake works
was too much.

826
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,200
Well, you had no choice.

827
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,500
Where were you gonna go

828
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
after fake hooker girlfriend?

829
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,000
How did you know
he was outside?

830
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
Cane prints.

831
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,200
I'm actually
kind of insulted.

832
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,300
No way I'm a drug addict,

833
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,300
but you completely buy

834
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,200
that I fell in love
with a prostitute?

835
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,600
You played to your strengths.

836
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,100
By which I mean you played
to your weaknesses.

837
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,700
Oh, my god.

838
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,600
You invoked your dead
girlfriend's name to sell me.

839
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
You're my hero.

840
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,600
Best $30 I ever spent.

841
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,900
It's 30?
Did you keep her number?

842
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,400
Unfortunately, I killed her

843
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,000
and buried her in the basement.

844
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,000
Shame.

845
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,400
Hungry?

846
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah.

847
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,600
So, seriously.

848
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,600
Where were you
the other morning?

849
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,300
Ugh, don't make me
do this again.

850
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,800
It has nothing to do
with you.

851
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,700
Then tell me.

852
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
We're going bowling on monday.

853
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,100
<i>I'm coming over
to play poker this weekend.</i>

854
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,500
Nothing's changed.

855
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,700
You have to trust that.

856
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,800
Okay.

857
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,300
You're gonna keep following me,
aren't you?

858
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,700
It's what we do.

859
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,700
Be outside my apartment
at 8:00 tonight.

860
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,900
She said yes
to the transplant.

861
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,300
Good.

862
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,300
You're in a downward spiral
of destruction.

863
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,200
I can stop.

864
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,300
You're gonna keep spiraling.

865
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,700
Keep screwing around.

866
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,300
Keep slashing away
at every person

867
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,300
who tries to help until no one
tries to help anymore.

868
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Till you hit bottom.
Till you're dead.

869
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,600
Until then...

870
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,500
I can use you.

871
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,800
You're hiring me back?

872
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,500
You did good work.

873
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,000
I did good work yesterday,

874
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,300
and I was still fired.

875
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,300
What changed?

876
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,900
You wanted me to spend time
with her.

877
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,000
See if I could still make
a connection.

878
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,700
You connected with a diagnosis,
not with her.

879
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,800
You're trying to save me,

880
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,300
<i>trying to control me.</i>

881
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,300
<i>You're doing exactly</i>

882
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,400
<i>- what you think-
- Cracks.</i>

883
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,600
You're lips are cracked.

884
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
You been using
your inhaler lately?

885
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,900
Allergies.

886
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:41,900
Don't deflect.

887
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,200
<i>You always deflect.</i>

888
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,100
Did she cry?

889
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,800
When you told her
that she was gonna die,

890
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,400
did she cry?

891
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,300
She... Got upset. She-

892
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,400
Were there tears?

893
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
no.

894
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,800
Chopping an onion

895
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,700
releases a mist
of syn-propanethial-s-oxide,

896
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,800
a chemical irritant
which causes people

897
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,500
to have a very predictable
reaction.

898
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,400
She has no tears.

899
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,300
<i>It was either this
or put on brian's song.</i>

900
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,200
I didn't have time
to stop by wilson's.

901
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,200
She has sjogren's.

902
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:27,900
It attacks the glands

903
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,900
that produce tears
and saliva.

904
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,200
<i>Also, by the way,</i>

905
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,300
causes lung cysts and rta.

906
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,000
It doesn't cause bleeding.

907
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,300
It's like you and men.

908
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,100
Just 'cause you usually don't,

909
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,100
doesn't mean you can't.

910
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,000
And it doesn't cause
cracked lips

911
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,000
in other people.

912
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,600
Lack of spit makes her mouth

913
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,200
a breeding ground
for a fungus like candida.

914
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,700
Your asthma inhaler
did the same for you.

915
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,400
Wiped out your mouth's
immune system.

916
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,200
So she's got what I've got.

917
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,400
Just the opportunistic
infection,

918
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,100
<i>not the underlying condition.</i>

919
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,500
Another life saved
by girl-on-girl action.

920
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm gonna be okay?

921
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,000
You're gonna be okay.

922
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,300
Methylprednisolone

923
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,700
<i>to get the sjogren's
under control.</i>

924
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,400
And some artificial tears

925
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,100
to maximize the visual impact
of this moment.

926
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,800
Spencer's gonna be fine.

927
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,700
And I hear you got
your job back.

928
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,400
I'm gonna keep standing here
until you say something.

929
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,200
I feel alone.

930
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,800
And she hasn't gone anywhere.

931
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,200
She gets to live.

932
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,600
I'm gonna go home.

933
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,900
I'm tired.

934
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
What do you think?

935
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,500
Oh, my god!

936
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,900
You guys shop here too?

937
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,700
Best nipples in princeton.

938
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,400
Why are you here?

939
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,100
Because he ate the donut.

940
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,500
I'm so sorry.

941
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,600
He must've followed me.

942
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,700
I'm sure.

943
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,800
Well, you're clearly
not pregnant,

944
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,900
so either you're buying this
as a gift,

945
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,600
or this is some kind of weird

946
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,900
"if you build it,
they will come" moment.

947
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,400
I'm adopting a baby.

948
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,700
She asked me to be
a character reference.

949
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,400
That's where I was
the other morning.

950
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:21,900
I'm sorry.

951
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,000
I couldn't betray
her confidence.

952
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,000
I didn't want anyone else
to know

953
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,100
in case I didn't get
approved.

954
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,300
Today, I did.

955
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,700
<i>* it's a dark road *</i>

956
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,800
* and a dark way that leads *

957
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,900
* to my house *

958
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,300
* and the word says *

959
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,600
* you're never gonna find me
there *

960
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:42,800
* oh no *

961
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,900
are you gonna congratulate me?

962
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,200
If you're happy, I'm...

963
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,300
* it didn't get there *

964
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,600
* by itself *

965
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:02,300
* there's a feeling,
but you're not feeling it *

966
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,100
* at all *

967
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,400
* there's a meaning *

968
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,800
* but you're not listening
anymore...
