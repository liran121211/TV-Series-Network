1
00:00:23,882 --> 00:00:26,638
I still can't believe
you talked me into this.

2
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,583
[Chuckling]
come on, honey.

3
00:00:28,726 --> 00:00:30,006
You're gonna throw him off.

4
00:00:30,056 --> 00:00:32,425
It's okay.
I'm almost done.

5
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:36,452
A little more light
on your hips.

6
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:37,962
Oh, god.

7
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:39,329
Why couldn't you have
come up with this

8
00:00:39,396 --> 00:00:40,998
Before I had two kids?

9
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:44,507
[Laughs]
you look amazing.

10
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:47,060
Okay, I think...

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,879
Yeah, I'm done.

12
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,263
Wanna come take a look?

13
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,682
[Laughing nervously]
I can't.

14
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:00,679
You first.

15
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,429
No, we'll look together.

16
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:11,463
I don't understand.

17
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,630
I--I thought--

18
00:01:12,695 --> 00:01:14,048
What the hell is that?
Honey.

19
00:01:14,048 --> 00:01:14,896
It's okay.

20
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:16,096
This is not
what we discussed,

21
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:17,962
Or what I paid for.
I don't understand.

22
00:01:18,029 --> 00:01:19,563
I think this is one
of the best I've ever done.

23
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,892
I want my money back.

24
00:01:20,892 --> 00:01:21,774
I'm sorry,
but this is not

25
00:01:21,774 --> 00:01:23,296
Some department store
photo studio.

26
00:01:23,363 --> 00:01:25,296
And this is not my wife.

27
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:26,463
Yes, it is.

28
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,686
You asked me to paint her

29
00:01:27,686 --> 00:01:29,328
Exactly as she looks.

30
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:31,058
That's exactly what I did.

31
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:32,695
Uhh!
Honey!

32
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:33,795
Oh, stop it!

33
00:01:33,862 --> 00:01:35,596
What's going on?
Brandon!

34
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:36,647
That check...

35
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,929
Better be
in my mailbox by friday.

36
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:41,096
Or I'll be back.

37
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:42,958
Come on!

38
00:01:43,463 --> 00:01:44,496
What happened?

39
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,783
I don't know.

40
00:01:45,962 --> 00:01:48,461
They saw the painting
and they just freaked out.

41
00:01:51,996 --> 00:01:53,695
Brandon, what is this?

42
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:55,205
What do you mean?
It's her portrait.

43
00:01:56,429 --> 00:01:58,548
What's wrong with it?

44
00:02:39,754 --> 00:02:41,146
Why's this in here?

45
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:43,042
First column, last entry.

46
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:46,826
Today is going to be
a good day.

47
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,049
This him?

48
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:54,113
Yes.
No.

49
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:57,994
She means are you
the private investigator

50
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,261
Whose bills I've tried
to slip through

51
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:00,741
As medical expenses?

52
00:03:00,741 --> 00:03:01,717
Oh. Hi.

53
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,427
I'm lucas douglas, p.I.

54
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:06,229
This hospital's not putting
a private investigator on retainer.

55
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:10,028
Nor is it gonna pay
any more phony repairs on vending machines,

56
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:11,727
Cryostats, or elevators.

57
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:13,123
Information
saves lives.

58
00:03:13,123 --> 00:03:14,629
Saving lives saves money.

59
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,880
No, saving lives
costs money,

60
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,789
Which is why
I'm trying to make sure</I there's still some left!

61
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:21,538
You want your own
personal p.I.,

62
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:23,170
You're gonna have to pay
for him yourself.

63
00:03:23,898 --> 00:03:24,830
Sorry.

64
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,144
No, I understand.

65
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:28,494
Hey, I--I like
the shoes, by the way.

66
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:32,963
Thank...you.

67
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:37,301
You don't like her shoes.

68
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:38,499
You like her legs.

69
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:39,816
It sounds less creepy

70
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:40,784
If you say shoes.

71
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:42,809
Less creepy, more gay.

72
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:44,284
That's my firm's motto.

73
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:46,506
What is a cryostat?

74
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:47,960
No idea.

75
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:51,555
Whoever fixed ours
is about to get stiffed.

76
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:06,841
There's
no distorted perspective in any of his
other recent works.

77
00:04:07,174 --> 00:04:08,877
Not much talent,
either.

78
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:10,589
So the symptoms
just came on.

79
00:04:10,589 --> 00:04:13,880
Acute onset visual agnosia  points to a stroke
or brain tumor.

80
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,746
(Taub)
m.R.I. Revealed no stroke
or brain tumor.

81
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,162
We should do another
with contrast.

82
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:18,861
If he's like the other
struggling artists I've known,

83
00:04:18,861 --> 00:04:19,864
He's also into drugs.

84
00:04:19,864 --> 00:04:22,028
We should--
What are you looking at?

85
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,695
Apparently a moron.

86
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:26,429
One--E.R. Routinely tests
for drugs.

87
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,695
If it was positive,

88
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:28,961
We wouldn't be looking
at this file.

89
00:04:29,028 --> 00:04:32,762
Two--Who pays 12% interest
on a car loan?

90
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:34,061
How did you--

91
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:35,429
Did you run
a credit check on me?

92
00:04:35,495 --> 00:04:37,095
No...that would be illegal.

93
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:38,362
Interestingly enough,

94
00:04:38,429 --> 00:04:40,462
Paying someone
to run it for me, though...

95
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:44,792
What?

96
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:45,812
It's part of my job.

97
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:47,495
Your job
is to diagnose patients.

98
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:48,568
Which I do
with the team.

99
00:04:48,568 --> 00:04:50,361
How am I supposed to know
how best to utilize

100
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:52,985
That team if I don't know
everything about them?

101
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:56,926
Say the van gogh turns out
to have neurosyphilis,

102
00:04:56,926 --> 00:04:59,121
And our last vial of penicillin
is in a storeroom

103
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:00,928
At the end
of a 20-Mile hallway with a two-Foot high ceiling.

104
00:05:00,995 --> 00:05:02,796
With a two-Foot high ceiling.

105
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:04,537
You've discovered
that one of us has been

106
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:06,994
Hiding the ability
to stretch or shrink themselves?

107
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:08,026
No.

108
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:10,262
I would never out someone's
super powers.

109
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,415
This, on the other hand...

110
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:18,028
You crawled 20 miles?

111
00:05:18,095 --> 00:05:19,662
My name's
in the guinness book.

112
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,896
I'll bet that really
impresses the babes.

113
00:05:21,961 --> 00:05:23,362
I didn't do it
to get the babes.

114
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:26,398
No, that would cheapen
the purity of your achievement.

115
00:05:26,398 --> 00:05:29,213
(Foreman)
sorry to interrupt,
but we have a patientwith a probable
brain tumor.

116
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:30,870
Who needs an m.R.I.
With contrast,

117
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,028
We've established that.

118
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:33,450
What do you got on taub?

119
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:36,009
I got nothing on taub.

120
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,220
(Thirteen)
could also
be environmental.

121
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,762
We should check his studio
for toxins, mold, fungus.

122
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:40,937
Taub's wife,
on the other hand--

123
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:41,829
(Foreman)
house...

124
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:43,395
That's enough.

125
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:46,264
Dad's right.

126
00:05:46,264 --> 00:05:47,829
This is no time for gossip.

127
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:50,216
A patient desperately needs
our help.

128
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:53,028
Check his head
and his house.

129
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:54,437
Can't lucas--
Nope.

130
00:05:55,028 --> 00:05:56,295
He's very busy.

131
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,295
(Foreman)
if there is a tumor,
this test will show us--

132
00:06:00,362 --> 00:06:01,732
Is that stuff dangerous?

133
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:03,792
This is just
the contrast material.

134
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:07,695
There is a small risk
of an anaphylactic reaction.

135
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:09,729
I could stop breathing?

136
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:10,729
Don't worry.

137
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:12,422
We're prepared to dealwith whatever happens.

138
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:14,061
You know, I did some drawings
this morning,

139
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:15,235
And they seemed fine.

140
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:17,237
So maybe it was just a reaction
to something I ate.

141
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:19,132
How many people you know
have reactions like that

142
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:20,336
To something
they ate for breakfast?

143
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:21,637
But if I'm
getting better--

144
00:06:21,637 --> 00:06:22,780
You will continue
to get better.

145
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,477
If you're not,
we need to know why not

146
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:26,410
So we can start treatment
immediately.

147
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,429
Baby, let them
do the test.

148
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:44,418
Can lead poisoning
cause visual agnosia?

149
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:46,562
(Taub)
not without lead
showing up in the blood work.

150
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:50,149
Nothing
in the medicine cabinetexcept some harmless
toiletries.

151
00:06:50,695 --> 00:06:53,274
No signs of mold
or fungus anywhere, either.

152
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:55,416
You think house really
got something on your wife?

153
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:57,425
No. Not that
I'd care if he did.

154
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:01,028
Wait, your wife's
doing the doorman in your bed,

155
00:07:01,095 --> 00:07:03,770
And they're
sweating all over the sheets
that you paid for and--

156
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,986
My wife's not doing
the doorman.

157
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:07,293
How do you know?
We don't have a doorman.

158
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:10,228
And I just do, okay?

159
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:11,653
Drop it.

160
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:15,413
In college,
my friends and I came up
with an inverse-Square law.

161
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:16,882
Sounds like
a real fun group.

162
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:18,868
The girls who you think
are the most inhibited...

163
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:20,131
Straight arrows...

164
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:21,562
They're the ones
you hook up with.

165
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:23,526
Are you saying
my wife's a slut?

166
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,961
I'm saying if my wife
was a slut, I'd wanna know.

167
00:07:29,862 --> 00:07:31,293
(Kutner)
his place was clean.

168
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:32,896
(House)
so is his head.

169
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:36,128
Even with contrast,
no masses, no lesions.

170
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:39,625
A neurological symptom with no apparent
neurological cause.

171
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,038
Time course means
we can rule out cancer and m.S.

172
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:43,796
Just leaves toxins
or drugs.

173
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:46,794
You called thirteen
a moron  for thinking
it was drugs.

174
00:07:46,794 --> 00:07:48,961
Yeah, but when she said it,
she had other options.

175
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:51,871
And I really
just wanted to segue into her stupid loan
and your--

176
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,044
A cavernous angioma
in the brain could leak.

177
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,228
Once the blood
gets reabsorbed,

178
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:56,866
The pressure goes down,
the symptom goes away.

179
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:58,961
He'll never consent
to petrosal vein sampling.

180
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:02,128
Really?

181
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:05,032
He was nervous about
an injection of contrast.

182
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:07,705
Is his girlfriend hot?

183
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:09,909
And I'm not talking
fever here.

184
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:11,870
I mean, is she all
curvy and perky?

185
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,399
Very...and if he dies,

186
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,763
It's good news
for all of us, but--

187
00:08:14,763 --> 00:08:16,764
That explains
why all his paintings suck.

188
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,442
And what's wrong with him.

189
00:08:18,834 --> 00:08:19,882
Where are you going?

190
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:22,259
To tell him he may have
a massive brain tumor.

191
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,324
But he doesn't.

192
00:08:23,324 --> 00:08:25,056
I know.
I'm not a moron.

193
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:26,207
It's drugs.

194
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:33,182
You seem to have
a massive brain tumor.

195
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,440
Who are you?

196
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:36,671
He's dr. House.
He's pleased to meet you.

197
00:08:36,671 --> 00:08:38,828
We found no trace
on any of your imaging,

198
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,273
So we need to cut
your head open.

199
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,359
It's risky,

200
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:43,322
But it's the only way
to save your life.

201
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:44,747
No.

202
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:46,452
Wrong answer.

203
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:48,097
I'm not allowed
to say no?

204
00:08:48,097 --> 00:08:50,365
You're not allowed
to not be terrified.

205
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:53,364
There's only
two good reasons not to be terrified
in a hospital.

206
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:54,634
You're delusional.

207
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:57,585
But then you're not afraid
of contrast material either.

208
00:08:57,585 --> 00:08:58,948
Or you know you're fine.

209
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:00,767
Since we haven't told you
you're fine,

210
00:09:00,767 --> 00:09:03,393
You obviously have
information we don't have.

211
00:09:03,393 --> 00:09:04,708
What drugs are you on?

212
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:05,886
His drug tests
were clean.

213
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:08,270
Drug tests only test for drugs
they've made tests for.

214
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,744
What are you
talking about?

215
00:09:11,087 --> 00:09:14,309
Hottie thinks
that he's a great artist,

216
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:16,215
Selling art
to the rich and tasteful.

217
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:18,636
She's stupid enough to be fooled
by the canvases,

218
00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:20,157
But bank accounts
don't lie.

219
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:21,205
He needed money.

220
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:22,330
There's not many jobs
you can do

221
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:24,754
That don't require time,
training, and intelligence.

222
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:27,125
And I know
you're not a news anchor  or a supermodel,

223
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,486
'Cause those jobs
seldom cause agnosia.

224
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,853
He's a guinea pig.

225
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,980
Companies pay him to test
their untested drugs.

226
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:42,428
Did hottie go for a pee
or coffee?

227
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:45,593
Either way,
I don't think you should waste any time on denials.

228
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:50,530
The clinical trials
were supposed to be safe.

229
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:53,128
The drugs are about
to be approved by the fda.

230
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:55,613
Drugs?
How many trials are you on?

231
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,035
Three.

232
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:00,897
Admirable.

233
00:10:00,964 --> 00:10:03,407
Not many idiots
have that much ambition.

234
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,809
You've been symptom-Free
since your admission,

235
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:08,367
So whatever you took has probably
cleared your system now.

236
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,465
You'll be fine.

237
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:11,133
Keep him overnight,
just to make sure,

238
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:13,205
And get the names
of all the trials he's been in.

239
00:10:13,594 --> 00:10:15,129
You gonna tell heather?

240
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:18,454
Couldn't, even if I cared enough
to want to.

241
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:34,053
Not bad.

242
00:10:34,053 --> 00:10:35,903
You almost made it
the whole day.

243
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,087
What'd you find out?

244
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:39,463
The point is to see
how everyone reacts.

245
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,345
I'm gonna go get
the rest of the gang.

246
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:42,558
Cut the crap, house.

247
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:48,283
Your wife has
a separate bank account

248
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:49,557
In her name only.

249
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:51,386
She's been making
weekly cash deposits

250
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:52,423
For about a year now.

251
00:10:52,715 --> 00:10:54,969
No withdrawals...yet.

252
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:57,144
That's it?

253
00:10:57,595 --> 00:10:58,943
A bank account?

254
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,728
A secret bank account.

255
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,770
What makes you think
it's a secret?

256
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:03,901
Because if it wasn't,

257
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:06,402
You'd call it
"the" bank account.

258
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,710
Damn.

259
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,911
Always forget to use
the right article when lying.

260
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:12,099
It's not secret.

261
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:13,278
We're refurnishing.

262
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:14,808
We set the budget,
set up an account.

263
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,951
I just couldn't make it
to the bank the day we opened it.

264
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:20,803
You're spending almost
$100,000 on furniture?

265
00:11:21,564 --> 00:11:23,203
Yes.

266
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,736
What happened?
I don't know.

267
00:11:28,005 --> 00:11:30,171
He was fine, then all of
a sudden, he started seizing.

268
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:31,860
He said you told him
he was better.

269
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,616
What's happening?

270
00:11:32,616 --> 00:11:33,784
What's wrong with him?

271
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:38,669
She is hot.

272
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,909
Obviously the drugs
weren't out of his system.

273
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:45,804
None of these drugs,

274
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,170
Nor the drugs
that they're derived from,

275
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:48,204
Are known
for causing seizures.

276
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:49,338
By themselves, no.

277
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:52,061
But three unproven,
untested drugs?

278
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,180
This is like the mod squad.

279
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,566
No one could stop them.

280
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:57,859
Ridiculous
that they let people take potentially dangerous drugs
for money.

281
00:11:57,859 --> 00:11:59,204
Just to short circuit
that discussion,

282
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:01,737
People should not be testing
drugs because they're desperate.

283
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,184
But people won't test drugs
unless they're desperate.

284
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:07,154
We need drugs
to save children and puppies.

285
00:12:07,154 --> 00:12:08,137
Ergo, we need
desperate people.

286
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:10,971
Ergo, welfare kills
sick children.

287
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:13,667
First drug--

288
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,544
Why don't we call it
bisexidrine?

289
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:18,880
Clinical trials
involve experimental drugs.

290
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,174
Means they don't have
comforting, catchy names yet.

291
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:23,263
Just random, unmemorable
trial numbers.

292
00:12:23,496 --> 00:12:24,371
Go ahead.

293
00:12:24,438 --> 00:12:27,196
Bisexidrine is designed
as an anticoagulant.

294
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:29,164
Phase one indicated
some risk of nausea,

295
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:30,169
E.D., and insomnia.

296
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:31,164
Second drug.

297
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:32,635
Cuckoldisol.

298
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:35,541
She is having an affair?

299
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:36,371
Worse.

300
00:12:36,438 --> 00:12:38,879
Sex can be dismissed
as hormonal or emotional.

301
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:39,973
Can be easily regretted.

302
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:41,967
Money is always
a calculated decision.

303
00:12:41,967 --> 00:12:43,521
My wife has
her own bank account

304
00:12:43,521 --> 00:12:45,263
That house doesn't think
I know about.

305
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:46,038
Shocking.

306
00:12:46,038 --> 00:12:46,804
Discuss.

307
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:48,892
Drug b
is an autoimmune treatment.

308
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:49,996
Almost no side effects.

309
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:51,614
But even if it's doing
what it's supposed to be doing,

310
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:54,419
It doesn't mix well
with anticoagulants or anticonvulsives.

311
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:55,510
(Kutner)
which is the third drug?

312
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,901
World's-Sorest-Knees-Isil.

313
00:12:58,372 --> 00:12:59,736
Cuddy used to have
that title, by the way.

314
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:01,914
(Foreman)
there's a million ways
these drugs could interact

315
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,646
If they're doing
what they're supposed to.

316
00:13:03,646 --> 00:13:04,949
If they're not,
two million.

317
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:07,207
And it'd be interesting to know
which of those interactions

318
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:08,242
Was causing the problem.

319
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:09,261
Unfortunately,
we don't have to.

320
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:10,810
We just have to stop
the interacting.

321
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,670
If we don't know which--

322
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:13,766
Stop them all.
Put him on dialysis.

323
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:14,640
Clear out his system.

324
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,071
Rapid detox
risks arrhythmia,

325
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:17,599
Another seizure,
hepatic failure.

326
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,217
Difference is, we know
what those risks are.

327
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:20,719
Put him on dialysis.

328
00:13:23,157 --> 00:13:24,338
Dialysis.

329
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:25,804
Use that for kidney failure,
right?

330
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,551
Don't worry.
Your kidneys are fine.

331
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:29,290
He's not worried
about his kidneys.

332
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,146
He's worried about how

333
00:13:30,146 --> 00:13:32,529
He's going to explain
the dialysis to his girlfriend.

334
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,243
I just don't want her
to worry.

335
00:13:34,243 --> 00:13:35,901
You mean you don't want her
to leave you?

336
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:38,613
What's wrong with that?
I love her.

337
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,193
It's not like I've lied to her
about anything important.

338
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:42,337
I am an artist.

339
00:13:42,337 --> 00:13:43,987
I've sold plenty of paintings
in the past.

340
00:13:43,987 --> 00:13:44,935
It's just...

341
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:47,138
I've hit a bit of
a dry spell lately, is all.

342
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:48,298
So tell her that.

343
00:13:48,754 --> 00:13:50,102
He can't.

344
00:13:50,102 --> 00:13:52,071
He wants her
to be happy too.

345
00:13:52,138 --> 00:13:54,374
He's telling her
what she wants to hear.

346
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:00,800
You didn't know?

347
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:02,904
No.

348
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:04,371
What are you gonna do?

349
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:05,856
She's not sleeping around.

350
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:06,737
She's not gambling it away.

351
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,904
She hasn't even spent
any of it.

352
00:14:07,971 --> 00:14:10,138
So I don't see a reason
to do anything.

353
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:11,771
You don't think
a conversation might--

354
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:13,104
How many people
do you know

355
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:16,204
In completely happy
and fulfilled relationships?

356
00:14:16,735 --> 00:14:17,678
None.

357
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:18,637
I am.

358
00:14:18,637 --> 00:14:22,223
Most people cling to some storybook notion
of what a relationship is.

359
00:14:22,223 --> 00:14:23,771
You can't have
an imperfect thought.

360
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:25,675
You can't have
a private zone.

361
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:28,282
You can't--
Steal money
and hide it away in a secret account?

362
00:14:28,704 --> 00:14:31,321
She makes me happy.
I make her happy.

363
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:32,372
It works.

364
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,886
Because we
don't do storybook.

365
00:14:33,886 --> 00:14:35,702
And I don't plan to poke
into her business.

366
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:45,170
You were right
about the dialysis.

367
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,338
He made it
through the night without any more seizures
or visual symptoms.

368
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:51,633
And I am going to be
just as rightafter breakfast
up in my office.

369
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:54,193
The only difference is I'm gonna be right
in front of other people.

370
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,507
Which means you're not here
to talk about the medicine.

371
00:14:56,507 --> 00:14:58,302
You can screw with me
all you want at work,

372
00:14:58,302 --> 00:14:59,893
But stay out
of my personal life.

373
00:14:59,893 --> 00:15:01,500
What did she say?

374
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:03,394
Did you just hear
what I said?

375
00:15:03,394 --> 00:15:05,995
I heard the part about you can screw with me
at work all you want.

376
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:07,539
Want my advice?
Of course not.

377
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,480
Good, 'cause I have no idea
what you should do.

378
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,240
I only know
what you're going to do.

379
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,934
You're gonna--
I said I didn't want
your advice.

380
00:15:12,934 --> 00:15:14,274
I said this is not advice.

381
00:15:14,274 --> 00:15:16,667
You are going to forgive her
for opening that account,

382
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,353
And you're going to confess
everything you've done,

383
00:15:18,353 --> 00:15:20,138
And then you're gonna beg her
to forgive you.

384
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:22,401
What purpose
could that possibly serve?

385
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,936
None...which is why
I'm not saying you should.

386
00:15:24,971 --> 00:15:26,484
But you will.

387
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,462
(Lucas)
what's your end game?

388
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:34,630
Where are you?

389
00:15:34,962 --> 00:15:36,239
At the track.

390
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,804
That's, like, six miles away.

391
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:39,472
How cool are these things?

392
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:40,774
I feel like an idiot.

393
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:48,225
I'm not giving you
any more of my stuff.

394
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:50,234
You have those
night vision goggles?

395
00:15:50,234 --> 00:15:51,604
No.

396
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,004
You're lying.

397
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:54,635
You like making him
miserable.

398
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:57,464
You like driving people
away from you.

399
00:15:57,464 --> 00:15:58,787
He deserved
to know the truth.

400
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:00,595
There was no truth
until you dug it up.

401
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:02,023
You do know
that stuff exists

402
00:16:02,023 --> 00:16:03,904
Even when
you can't see it, right?

403
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:06,062
It was a truth
that mattered to him

404
00:16:06,062 --> 00:16:07,510
And a truth
that mattered to her.

405
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,969
Why did it matter to you?

406
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,992
(House)
first of all,
stop saying "a" truth.

407
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:12,228
There is only one truth.

408
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:14,011
That may be true for you.

409
00:16:15,096 --> 00:16:17,497
Miserable people
save more lives.

410
00:16:17,497 --> 00:16:18,405
If your life has meaning,

411
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:20,071
Your job doesn't
have to have meaning.

412
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:21,937
Screw-Ups
are more palatable

413
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:23,595
If you have someone's arms
to go cry in.

414
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:25,151
Yeah, that makes sense.

415
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:27,600
Usually I have more of a fight
on that one.

416
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,154
So why are you

417
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,595
Making taub miserable?

418
00:16:29,595 --> 00:16:30,889
I just said!

419
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,670
He left his last job
to save his marriage.

420
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:34,004
If his marriage falls apart,

421
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:35,771
You think he'll be
working harder for you?

422
00:16:35,837 --> 00:16:38,346
Or you think he won't be working
for you at all?

423
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:44,689
(Foreman)
his head and neck
are completely swollen.

424
00:16:44,689 --> 00:16:46,792
I need a trache kit.
His throat's closing.

425
00:16:52,656 --> 00:16:54,198
Can't find any landmarks.

426
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:55,959
Just start cutting.
An exploratory trache?

427
00:16:55,959 --> 00:16:56,915
We don't have a choice.

428
00:16:59,271 --> 00:17:00,339
Got it.

429
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:01,111
Here.

430
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,452
(Kutner)
his face is so swollen it squeezed
his tear ducts shut.

431
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:15,075
We've been lubricating
his eyes by hand.

432
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:17,304
We started him on steroids,
iv and cream,

433
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:18,238
To reduce the swelling,

434
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:19,318
But it's having
limited effect.

435
00:17:19,368 --> 00:17:21,167
Negative for thrombosis
and chagas.

436
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:22,435
Could be infection.

437
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:23,602
Culture's
still negative.

438
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,529
Could be his immune system's
on hyperdrive.

439
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:26,435
Cytokine storm.

440
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:29,103
Why would you pay
for a three-Year gym membership

441
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:30,307
And only go twice?

442
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,409
Sorry.
You guys still diagnosing?

443
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:37,666
Thought we'd finished
hours ago.

444
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,101
You remember, when we decided
it was the unproven,

445
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:42,201
Unapproved cocktail of drugs
he's been downing like...

446
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:44,068
Like a cocktail.

447
00:17:44,135 --> 00:17:46,025
He just completed
a total dialysis.

448
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:47,800
If it was the drugs,
he'd be better.

449
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,023
Or he'd be worse.

450
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:52,605
I take it none of you
saw trainspotting.

451
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,690
You think swelling
is a symptom of withdrawal?

452
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,022
You think it's a coincidence that three new symptoms
cropped up

453
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:58,454
As soon as we
took him off the drugs?

454
00:17:58,454 --> 00:17:59,726
It's possible
some of the symptoms--

455
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:01,109
Either the drugs
are the answer,

456
00:18:01,109 --> 00:18:02,653
Or the drugs
are a coincidence.

457
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:04,786
If it's one, we have to find
a better way to detox him.

458
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:05,928
If it's two,
we have to know

459
00:18:05,928 --> 00:18:07,550
Which symptoms
are withdrawal-Related

460
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,303
Before we can formulate
a diagnosis.

461
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:11,705
Which means we have to find
a better way to detox him.

462
00:18:11,705 --> 00:18:12,826
So how do we do it?

463
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,106
Hair of the drug
that bit him.

464
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:16,183
That's ridiculous.

465
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:17,796
If it is the drugs,
they're dangerous,

466
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:18,795
And they've already caused--

467
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,342
That's why we're gonna put him
back on the drugs,

468
00:18:20,342 --> 00:18:21,504
And then
wean him off again.

469
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:22,732
Just much slower.

470
00:18:25,032 --> 00:18:26,419
Why are you looking at him?

471
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:28,656
Try it out.

472
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:30,783
You heard the boss!

473
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,502
Go!

474
00:18:34,973 --> 00:18:35,872
Taub--

475
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:37,051
I didn't talk to her.

476
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,435
Why are you--

477
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:48,839
Excuse me.

478
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,397
Uh, sorry.

479
00:18:58,068 --> 00:19:00,262
He does look like me,
doesn't he?

480
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:01,368
You gave him your hat.

481
00:19:01,368 --> 00:19:03,552
I needed you out of here,
so I could go through your desk.

482
00:19:03,552 --> 00:19:04,697
Of course.

483
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:05,745
Nice blouse.

484
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,547
I really like
that color on you.

485
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:09,847
Tell house that if he wants
to know what I'm doing,

486
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:10,815
All he has to do--

487
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:12,966
It's not house, it's--
It's me.

488
00:19:12,966 --> 00:19:14,108
I was--I don't know.

489
00:19:14,108 --> 00:19:16,079
I was thinking
maybe we could get together

490
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:17,080
For a drink or something.

491
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,086
I wasn't sure exactly
what you like to do.

492
00:19:19,086 --> 00:19:20,416
So I thought...
you'd spy on me.

493
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,481
No. No.

494
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:23,261
Not spying.
More like research.

495
00:19:23,261 --> 00:19:24,304
I think it's a good idea

496
00:19:24,304 --> 00:19:27,249
To get to know
a little bit more about a woman before you ask her out.

497
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,749
Show you care about more
than just what she looks like.

498
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:34,067
As romantic
as you make that sound,

499
00:19:34,067 --> 00:19:36,345
I'm pretty sure that
what you're doing is...

500
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:38,967
Not so much caring
as creepy.

501
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:40,018
That's not fair.

502
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:41,804
You were scrounging
through my desk.

503
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:42,973
What the hell
am I gonna find out?

504
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:43,995
You went to michigan.

505
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:46,032
You like your sandwiches
a little light on mayo.

506
00:19:46,032 --> 00:19:47,649
You stay in touch
with your mother.

507
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:49,111
You rented
the english patient

508
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:51,791
And you gave money
to amnesty international.

509
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,249
There's not one thing
I can find out in here

510
00:19:53,249 --> 00:19:56,033
That you wouldn't tell
a coworker while riding
in an elevator.

511
00:19:57,838 --> 00:19:58,731
I'm not a creep.

512
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,883
I just thought
you seemed interesting.

513
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,201
[Whispering]
I'll go now.

514
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:08,401
Yeah, these, um...

515
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:16,568
I'll give you
embarrassing info on house.

516
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:18,783
In exchange for--

517
00:20:18,783 --> 00:20:19,889
No, no need for a date.

518
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:21,034
You'd be employing me,

519
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:24,854
So I'd have all the time
in the world to ask you all about you,

520
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:27,029
And it would fall under
the category of socializing

521
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:28,116
Instead of creepy stalking.

522
00:20:28,116 --> 00:20:29,190
And I'd be paying you?

523
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:29,960
I know it's weird.

524
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,735
But if you pay me
while I check you out,

525
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:33,016
It's--It's all cool.

526
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:35,307
And you get value,
you get leverage against him.

527
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:36,585
Help you keep him in line.

528
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:38,171
You think I need help
keeping house in line?

529
00:20:38,171 --> 00:20:39,061
No.

530
00:20:41,124 --> 00:20:42,677
Nope. Sorry.

531
00:20:43,718 --> 00:20:45,691
This hospital can't afford--

532
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:47,075
Oh, whatever
you can afford.

533
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,301
How'd you know
I liked roses?

534
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:56,401
I was in your house
last night.

535
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:58,101
No! I'm kidding.

536
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:01,034
Who the hell
doesn't like roses?

537
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,103
I forgot to tell you.

538
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:19,138
The parker quartet's gonna play
at the library fundraiser.

539
00:21:23,454 --> 00:21:24,412
That's it?

540
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:26,069
It was your idea.

541
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:28,269
They'll be great.

542
00:21:35,667 --> 00:21:36,631
You okay?

543
00:21:39,135 --> 00:21:40,634
I couldn't find
the letter opener.

544
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:45,342
I went through some
of the drawers in your desk  looking for it.

545
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:49,087
There were a bunch
of statements  in there from

546
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:51,227
Jefferson mutual.

547
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,634
I was so close.

548
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,801
To what?

549
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:06,734
You've got $83,000

550
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:08,701
Socked away
in a secret account.

551
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:10,639
Not anymore.

552
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:15,568
I wanted to keep it
a surprise, but...

553
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:21,236
I bought you a car.

554
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:27,968
The one that...

555
00:22:28,034 --> 00:22:29,468
That I...

556
00:22:29,535 --> 00:22:31,673
I knew you would never
buy it yourself,

557
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:32,843
So...

558
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:35,256
I've been saving.

559
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:38,801
And it's gonna be delivered
on friday.

560
00:22:42,868 --> 00:22:45,301
You are amazing.

561
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:47,968
Lucky you.

562
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:55,729
We've gradually
reduced your dosage.

563
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,732
You're actually
drug-Free now.

564
00:22:57,732 --> 00:23:00,135
I feel great.
Thanks to you.

565
00:23:00,201 --> 00:23:01,878
All part of the job.

566
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:03,750
Your blood pressure's
normal.

567
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,315
Can you sit up?

568
00:23:08,701 --> 00:23:09,489
Hey!

569
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:12,334
What are you--Ohh!

570
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:20,318
What happened to his face?

571
00:23:20,318 --> 00:23:22,268
Question is what happened
to his hormones?

572
00:23:22,335 --> 00:23:24,026
We're gonna need
an ice pack in here!

573
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:30,884
(Kutner)
we can rule out the clinical
trial drugs at this point.

574
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,989
His system has been
completely cleaned twice.

575
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,180
Unless the drugs found
a hiding place under the stairs.

576
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,551
Drugs could have set offa dormant neurological
condition.

577
00:23:37,651 --> 00:23:38,523
Good point.

578
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,451
Coming clean
can cause a lot of damage.

579
00:23:41,451 --> 00:23:43,642
Alienation, divorce.

580
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:45,811
My wife's buying me a car.

581
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:48,944
I was talking
about the patient.

582
00:23:48,944 --> 00:23:49,784
You were wrong.

583
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:51,474
Divorce was metaphorical.

584
00:23:51,934 --> 00:23:53,821
(Foreman)
what about kluver-Bucy
syndrome?

585
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:55,731
Bilateral lesions
in the temporal lobes,

586
00:23:55,731 --> 00:23:58,198
Visual agnosia
and hyper-Sexualityare the key symptoms.

587
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,827
Good thing he's got
that girlfriend.

588
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:01,784
If it's kluver-Bucy,
his brain'll melt down,

589
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:03,350
He'll try to swallow
his own hands,

590
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:04,341
And she can
take care of him

591
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:05,797
For the rest
of his talentless life.

592
00:24:05,797 --> 00:24:06,750
You owe me an apology.

593
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,644
Any rationalization
you had for meddling
in my private life

594
00:24:09,717 --> 00:24:11,584
Disappeared when
she had good reason--

595
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:12,878
You're right.

596
00:24:14,058 --> 00:24:16,752
Fact is,
nothing I said applies.

597
00:24:17,517 --> 00:24:18,850
You had no reason
to forgive her.

598
00:24:18,851 --> 00:24:20,887
Therefore, no reason
to seek forgiveness.

599
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:22,637
No reason to be an idiot.

600
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,897
Kluver-Bucy
wouldn't explain the seizure or the cytokine storm.

601
00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:30,118
Withdrawal complications.

602
00:24:30,183 --> 00:24:34,298
Then again, she is handing you
a giant gift that you don't think
you deserve.

603
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:36,417
The fact that the m.R.I. Showed
no lesions on the temporal lobe

604
00:24:36,484 --> 00:24:38,851
Tends to rule out your lesions
on the temporal lobe theory.

605
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:41,576
The damage can be
a circulatory issue rather than structural.

606
00:24:41,576 --> 00:24:43,283
We wouldn't see that
on the m.R.I.

607
00:24:43,283 --> 00:24:44,636
Foreman's right.

608
00:24:44,636 --> 00:24:45,576
Go call your wife,

609
00:24:45,576 --> 00:24:46,553
Tell her
you're not coming home

610
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:49,097
'Cause you have
to give the patient a cranial m.R. Angiogram.

611
00:24:49,097 --> 00:24:51,784
Then say good night
and hang up.

612
00:25:13,584 --> 00:25:18,464
Odd that a man
who can't run would own so many pairs
of sneakers.

613
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,484
You mind hanging this up
when you're done?

614
00:25:22,084 --> 00:25:24,250
I have to find something
embarrassing about you.

615
00:25:24,317 --> 00:25:25,484
No, you don't.

616
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:28,118
I ordered us indian.

617
00:25:28,183 --> 00:25:29,417
Not too embarrassing,

618
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:31,183
Just something credible.

619
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,040
Well, if you
hand her that...

620
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:35,517
She's not gonna
need you anymore.

621
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:36,817
Well, if I don't
hand her anything,

622
00:25:36,884 --> 00:25:38,250
She'll think
I'm incompetent.

623
00:25:38,317 --> 00:25:40,183
I don't care if she thinks
you're incompetent.

624
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,884
This isn't gonna work.

625
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:44,183
It's worked so far.

626
00:25:44,573 --> 00:25:46,377
No, I'm no good at lying.

627
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,350
I know.

628
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:48,417
That's why your cover

629
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:50,317
Is that you
want to do her.

630
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:52,425
I like her.
I don't wanna do her.

631
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,186
Then what's the point
of liking her?

632
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,283
I meant I don't just
want to do her.

633
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,329
I like her.

634
00:25:58,618 --> 00:26:00,483
What do you think
you're gonna find out about her?

635
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:03,917
Something...personal.

636
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:05,232
Something embarrassing.

637
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:09,107
I've spent half my life
negotiating with that woman.

638
00:26:09,107 --> 00:26:12,171
Anything I can use
to scare her into saying yes.

639
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:17,550
Okay.

640
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:21,118
Okay?

641
00:26:21,183 --> 00:26:25,180
You're okay
with being paid twice to facilitate blackmail?

642
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:25,710
I'm okay.

643
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,075
I don't believe you,
but I'm okay.

644
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:31,248
You're doing this
for the same reason I'm doing this.

645
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,051
We'll see
who gets there first.

646
00:26:37,617 --> 00:26:38,784
(Kutner)
here it is.

647
00:26:38,851 --> 00:26:41,385
Circle of willis,
the vessels are narrow.

648
00:26:41,817 --> 00:26:44,651
Narrow for you,
normal for him.

649
00:26:44,717 --> 00:26:46,350
If there were problems
with the vessels,

650
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,774
He'd have had symptoms
long ago.

651
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,717
Not if something else
changed.

652
00:26:49,784 --> 00:26:51,417
Like?
His heart.

653
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,651
He could have recently gotten
an intermittent arrhythmia.

654
00:26:53,717 --> 00:26:56,183
I know "heart" and "head" start
with the same three letters,

655
00:26:56,183 --> 00:26:57,879
But you gotta read
all the way to the end.

656
00:26:58,614 --> 00:27:02,240
The experimental drug is causing arrhythmia,
which causes low blood pressure.

657
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,951
Combine that
with those narrow vessels,

658
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:05,681
The brain
doesn't get enough blood.

659
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:07,493
That causes
all of his symptoms.

660
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,517
If we can trigger the arrhythmia
and identify it,

661
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:11,439
We might be able
to stop it from killing him.

662
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,992
Been home?

663
00:27:14,992 --> 00:27:16,045
No.

664
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:17,732
Good.

665
00:27:17,732 --> 00:27:19,018
Do an e.P. Study.

666
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:20,580
Find the arrhythmia.

667
00:27:23,217 --> 00:27:26,305
We're gonna insert
three electrocatheters into your heart.

668
00:27:26,305 --> 00:27:27,647
Tell dr. Hadley
I'm sorry.

669
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:28,584
She understands.

670
00:27:28,651 --> 00:27:30,151
And you should
tell her yourself.

671
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:31,817
Maybe I should
tell heather about--

672
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:33,217
You're gonna be fine.

673
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:35,327
She's just so supportive.
And so great.

674
00:27:35,327 --> 00:27:37,150
All I do is lie to her.

675
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:39,197
What happens
if you tell her?

676
00:27:39,603 --> 00:27:41,437
I don't know.

677
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:43,350
You love her, right?

678
00:27:43,417 --> 00:27:45,250
More than anything,
and she loves me.

679
00:27:45,317 --> 00:27:47,283
If you open your mouth,
one of two things happens.

680
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,384
She either forgives you
or she leaves you.

681
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:52,687
At best, you wind up exactly
where you are right now.

682
00:27:52,687 --> 00:27:54,417
It's noble
to want to confess.

683
00:27:54,484 --> 00:27:55,528
Really, it is.

684
00:27:55,528 --> 00:27:58,172
But if the result's
just damage and pain,

685
00:27:58,172 --> 00:27:59,317
That's not noble.

686
00:27:59,384 --> 00:28:00,647
That's selfish.

687
00:28:03,651 --> 00:28:05,236
(Taub)
stimulate right atrium.

688
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,250
No more conduction.

689
00:28:07,317 --> 00:28:09,917
How long you plan
on keeping me from going home?

690
00:28:09,984 --> 00:28:12,113
Until you're convinced
I'm a different person,

691
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:14,486
One who won't
do anything stupid?

692
00:28:14,784 --> 00:28:17,381
Guilt fades quickly.

693
00:28:17,381 --> 00:28:18,990
By wednesday,
you'll be fine.

694
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,717
Right ventricle.

695
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,682
And why do you
want it to fade?

696
00:28:22,682 --> 00:28:25,084
Why do you suddenly care
about my marriage?

697
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,058
Because...
if it ain't broke--

698
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:28,584
You obviously think
it is broke.

699
00:28:28,651 --> 00:28:30,217
You obviously think
it ain't.

700
00:28:30,283 --> 00:28:32,018
Your marriage is like
a broken toaster.

701
00:28:32,084 --> 00:28:33,917
The bread keeps popping out,
and you keep calling it toast.

702
00:28:33,984 --> 00:28:36,618
Which is weird,
because you've put your bread in a lot of toasters.

703
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:37,817
And apparently,
you don't see any difference.

704
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,384
It's kind of fascinating.

705
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,570
[Rapid beeping]
he's going into v-Tach.

706
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,651
What's wrong?

707
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:43,848
Good news--
The test is working.

708
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:45,183
Your heart's freaking out,

709
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,785
But it's cool
that you're still conscious.

710
00:28:46,785 --> 00:28:48,085
Try to overdrive.

711
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,051
[Beep]
didn't work.

712
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,675
(Kutner)
this might burn a little bit.

713
00:28:57,676 --> 00:28:59,593
Charging to 60.
Clear.

714
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,685
Going again,
charging to 120.

715
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:05,279
Are you dyeing your hair?

716
00:29:07,672 --> 00:29:08,340
No.

717
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,276
House, clear.

718
00:29:09,343 --> 00:29:10,610
Right.

719
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,628
The hair is growing in red.

720
00:29:17,276 --> 00:29:18,970
(Taub)
his heart rate
is stabilized.

721
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:21,865
Does your theory include
any genetic mutations

722
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:23,788
That could cause his hair
to change color?

723
00:29:25,243 --> 00:29:28,536
Either he's lying
about dyeing...

724
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:31,143
Or just...dying.

725
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:36,569
Red hair means
it's not kluver-Bucy.

726
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:37,878
Melanin affects hair color.

727
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:39,603
What affects melanin?
Hormones.

728
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:40,744
Hormone panels
were all normal.

729
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:42,045
Age.

730
00:29:42,111 --> 00:29:44,016
He's turning
prematurely crimson?

731
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:45,336
A genetic disorder.

732
00:29:45,336 --> 00:29:47,111
Waardenburg syndrome
causes arrhythmias

733
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:48,245
And can change
hair color.

734
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:49,811
And make you deaf.
Next.

735
00:29:49,878 --> 00:29:51,844
Found a long
qt interval.

736
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:53,412
I think it's
romano-Ward syndrome.

737
00:29:53,478 --> 00:29:54,577
Explains the irregular
heart rhythms.

738
00:29:54,644 --> 00:29:56,111
But not the ginger nut.

739
00:29:56,178 --> 00:29:57,577
If he's got romano's,

740
00:29:57,644 --> 00:29:59,252
He's got at least
five gene mutations.

741
00:29:59,252 --> 00:30:00,078
Not a big leap to think

742
00:30:00,145 --> 00:30:01,579
He has others
that would give him the hair.

743
00:30:01,579 --> 00:30:02,778
It also gives him
the likelihood

744
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,443
Of sudden
and unexpected death.

745
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:05,762
Beta blockers don't work.

746
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:07,778
His heart can't handle
an I.C.D.

747
00:30:07,844 --> 00:30:09,632
Pete best.

748
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:15,644
Good god!

749
00:30:15,711 --> 00:30:17,611
Has none of you ever read
a history book?

750
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:19,412
The original
beatles drummer.

751
00:30:19,478 --> 00:30:20,978
A bunch of nerves

752
00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:22,278
Controls the tempo
of the heart.

753
00:30:22,345 --> 00:30:23,677
They're all playing in time,

754
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,138
Except one dude
can't keep the beat.

755
00:30:25,138 --> 00:30:26,045
Wrecks the whole thing.

756
00:30:26,111 --> 00:30:27,644
So we hire ringo.

757
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:29,412
Pete best was actually
a great drummer,

758
00:30:29,478 --> 00:30:32,339
But I assume
you mean the patient needs a cardiac sympathectomy?

759
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:33,544
Probably should have
just said that, huh?

760
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:35,511
Start cutting nerves,
you risk his swallowing,

761
00:30:35,512 --> 00:30:37,011
Vocal cords, sweating.

762
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:40,033
So he saves a fortune
on karaoke machines and deodorant.

763
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,054
You think he's stable enough
for surgery?

764
00:30:43,544 --> 00:30:46,058
If he was,
he wouldn't need it.

765
00:30:58,178 --> 00:31:00,097
Do you have
any brothers and sisters?

766
00:31:00,178 --> 00:31:01,345
One sister.

767
00:31:01,412 --> 00:31:03,694
He told me he was
on the lacrosse team.

768
00:31:03,694 --> 00:31:04,445
In high school.

769
00:31:04,512 --> 00:31:07,550
In college, he just cheered
the lacrosse team on to victory.

770
00:31:10,211 --> 00:31:11,616
How was your relationship
with your dad?

771
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:12,914
Fine.

772
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:14,584
You have
three more questions.

773
00:31:14,584 --> 00:31:15,778
How was your relationship
with your mom?

774
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:16,911
Fine.

775
00:31:16,978 --> 00:31:18,459
When did you lose
your virginity?

776
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:21,412
Not something
I'd discuss with coworkers

777
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:22,644
In an elevator.

778
00:31:24,677 --> 00:31:26,021
And...

779
00:31:26,744 --> 00:31:28,051
And...

780
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:32,445
You know, don't you?

781
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:38,178
A bit of a wasted
third question.

782
00:31:38,245 --> 00:31:40,478
'Cause the answer
is "know what?"

783
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,399
Okay, bear with me here.

784
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,697
Because some people
sometimes consider my thought processes
complicated.

785
00:31:46,711 --> 00:31:48,365
I'm into you,
'cause you're hot.

786
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:49,609
And smart.

787
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,711
In that order,
but both are needed.

788
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:53,844
Photos can be retouched.

789
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,445
And house
is an evil genius,

790
00:31:55,512 --> 00:31:57,412
Which makes this photo
suspicious.

791
00:31:57,478 --> 00:31:59,145
And yet you're
not suspicious.

792
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,412
Which means either you're not
smart enough to be suspicious,

793
00:32:01,478 --> 00:32:04,844
In which case,
I am less interested in you,

794
00:32:04,911 --> 00:32:06,716
Or you're
not suspicious because

795
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:10,512
You know this is actually
a doctored photo of house.

796
00:32:10,577 --> 00:32:13,726
In which case,
I am more interested in you.

797
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:16,278
But I am wasting my time,
because you know

798
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:17,512
This is a game
we are playing on you,

799
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:19,445
And I am busted.

800
00:32:19,512 --> 00:32:20,445
And I'm screwed.

801
00:32:22,944 --> 00:32:25,311
I know the photo's a fake.

802
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,778
And I know this is a game.

803
00:32:28,141 --> 00:32:29,478
I'm sorry.

804
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:33,178
Too bad.

805
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:37,388
Good-Bye.

806
00:32:44,345 --> 00:32:46,544
So you knew
that I wasn't

807
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:48,544
Gonna give you
anything worthwhile?

808
00:32:48,611 --> 00:32:51,319
A-And you were never gonna
give me anything worthwhile.

809
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:55,478
Then why did you bother
coming out with me?

810
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:59,278
I...wanted to screw
with house.

811
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,711
By wasting my time?

812
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,944
That doesn't make sense.

813
00:33:04,778 --> 00:33:06,211
No, uh...

814
00:33:06,278 --> 00:33:09,178
There must be
another reason.

815
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:12,974
Is it okay if I sit
back down here?

816
00:33:18,211 --> 00:33:19,832
(Hadley)
your heartbeat's
out of control.

817
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:23,053
We need to surgically
sever the connection between your heart
and brain.

818
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:24,577
We believe it's necessary,

819
00:33:24,644 --> 00:33:26,852
But you need to know
the ramifications.

820
00:33:26,852 --> 00:33:28,641
You'll never be able
to feel angina.

821
00:33:28,641 --> 00:33:30,929
You may not know
if you have a heart attack.

822
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:32,944
You may not be able
to get help in time.

823
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,676
Where are my
regular doctors?

824
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:36,412
Regular doctors?

825
00:33:36,478 --> 00:33:38,391
Dr. Taub
and dr. Hadley.

826
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:40,262
Why aren't they
telling me this?

827
00:33:40,878 --> 00:33:42,245
Brandon, I am
dr. Hadley.

828
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,412
And this is dr. Taub.

829
00:33:43,478 --> 00:33:45,778
What are you
talking about?

830
00:33:45,844 --> 00:33:48,644
I've never seen you before
in my life.

831
00:33:54,011 --> 00:33:56,266
(Taub)
we can't do the surgery.

832
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:57,432
We're back to where
we started.

833
00:33:57,432 --> 00:33:58,211
Visual agnosia.

834
00:33:58,278 --> 00:33:59,644
We need to reexamine
neurological disorders.

835
00:33:59,711 --> 00:34:01,078
Something's
slowly progressing.

836
00:34:01,145 --> 00:34:01,998
This isn't progressing.

837
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,862
It's there, then it's not,
then it is.

838
00:34:03,862 --> 00:34:06,333
It's a new symptom,
intermittence.

839
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,611
It's irrelevant.

840
00:34:08,677 --> 00:34:10,862
Since when
is a new symptom irrelevant?

841
00:34:10,862 --> 00:34:12,661
Since it points
towards the same disease.

842
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:14,412
Intermittence can fit
with romano-Ward.

843
00:34:14,412 --> 00:34:15,937
We still need to do
a sympathectomy.

844
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:17,107
(Taub)
maybe we missed something.

845
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:18,459
Toxins.
When?

846
00:34:19,202 --> 00:34:20,178
When you checked
every bottle,

847
00:34:20,245 --> 00:34:21,544
Every can,
every tube of paint?

848
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:23,247
Or when you
detoxed him twice?

849
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:27,119
Maybe there is a batch
of toxic paint that he used up
a few months ago.

850
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,512
Then he would have been
sick months ago, not now.

851
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:30,280
He's lost weight
since he got here.

852
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,111
That's a symptom of trying
to cram hospital food

853
00:34:32,178 --> 00:34:33,577
Down a throat
he can barely get air down.

854
00:34:33,644 --> 00:34:35,045
It's not a symptom,

855
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:37,865
But what if the toxins
were stored in his fat cells

856
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:38,688
A year ago,

857
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:41,460
And now they're being released
into his bloodstream?

858
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:44,840
So where you gonna get
this old paint?

859
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,911
City dump?

860
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:47,406
On his old paintings.

861
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:49,211
We know he
hasn't sold one in ages.

862
00:34:49,278 --> 00:34:51,011
But there weren't many
in his studio.

863
00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:52,421
He's hid them somewhere.

864
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,944
If you're wrong...

865
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:57,748
He could drop dead
from romano-Ward at any moment.

866
00:34:57,748 --> 00:34:58,945
You okay with that?

867
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:00,391
Just give me a few hours.

868
00:35:01,245 --> 00:35:02,577
You got one.

869
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:11,033
I need to talk
to him alone.

870
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:13,454
It's about your work.

871
00:35:13,454 --> 00:35:14,544
Your paintings.

872
00:35:14,611 --> 00:35:16,178
I need to look at

873
00:35:16,245 --> 00:35:18,445
All the ones
you've sold recently.

874
00:35:23,345 --> 00:35:24,944
Honey, can you
give us a minute?

875
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:26,682
To talk
about your paintings?

876
00:35:28,478 --> 00:35:29,778
Brandon, please.

877
00:35:29,844 --> 00:35:31,576
Tell me what's going on.

878
00:35:38,944 --> 00:35:42,968
I've only sold two paintings
in the last...three years.

879
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:45,192
Since we met.

880
00:35:45,192 --> 00:35:47,667
One was to my cousin.

881
00:35:47,744 --> 00:35:50,944
I've been making money
enrolling in drug trials.

882
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:53,911
Two, three at a time.

883
00:35:59,878 --> 00:36:01,611
Why did you lie to me?

884
00:36:01,677 --> 00:36:03,811
I wanna be, uh...

885
00:36:06,345 --> 00:36:07,911
The way you look at me.

886
00:36:07,978 --> 00:36:09,256
The way it makes me feel.

887
00:36:09,256 --> 00:36:10,911
Uh, I wanna be...

888
00:36:10,978 --> 00:36:13,278
What you see...

889
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:15,211
When you look at me.

890
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:21,378
You think
I'm that shallow?

891
00:36:23,345 --> 00:36:25,211
When I look at you...

892
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:27,944
I see you.

893
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:43,119
So...

894
00:36:45,512 --> 00:36:47,111
Where are the ones
you didn't sell?

895
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,274
It's not the paint,
it's the drugs.

896
00:38:17,274 --> 00:38:18,769
He's not on the drugs.

897
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:19,790
I know it doesn't
make sense,

898
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,917
But I'm looking at his paintings
for the last six months.

899
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:25,182
They're normal
april, june, and august.

900
00:38:25,182 --> 00:38:28,247
But they're distorted
may, july, september.

901
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:30,820
Every other month,
he was having visual agnosia,

902
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,879
Because every other month

903
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,029
He was on all three drugs
simultaneously.

904
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:36,829
The statinwas one month on,
one month off.

905
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:38,712
I don't know why the symptoms
keep coming and going,

906
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:40,284
But it is the drugs.

907
00:38:40,856 --> 00:38:43,033
They're hiding
under the stairs.

908
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:44,667
In the fat?
That doesn't make sense.

909
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:45,919
These drugs
aren't fat soluble.

910
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:47,833
I said stairs,
not closet.

911
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:51,038
What was the last drug
he was on before
the drugs he was on

912
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:52,286
When the symptoms
started?

913
00:38:52,353 --> 00:38:53,353
I'm not sure.
I think--

914
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,723
Antacid.

915
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:56,102
How do you know?

916
00:38:56,102 --> 00:38:57,053
It makes sense.

917
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:00,169
Also, I'm looking
at the file.

918
00:39:05,004 --> 00:39:05,741
Yes?

919
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,153
It's dr. House.

920
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,514
Uh, wake him up.
We're done.

921
00:39:13,514 --> 00:39:15,437
No, no--He says
he needs surgery,

922
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:16,531
But not this one.

923
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:18,126
Did he give
any specifics?

924
00:39:18,126 --> 00:39:20,850
Abdominal surgery
to remove a...bezoar.

925
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:23,786
It's like a hairball,

926
00:39:23,852 --> 00:39:26,596
But it's made up
of undigested food.

927
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:28,517
You can get it
if your stomach acid's low,

928
00:39:28,517 --> 00:39:31,752
Which brandon's was because
of an experimental antacid.

929
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:34,348
Fruit and vegetable fibers
and skins

930
00:39:34,348 --> 00:39:36,395
Get stuck together
and form a ball.

931
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:38,986
It gets sticky,
ferments, grows.

932
00:39:39,053 --> 00:39:41,953
It starts sucking up
some of the pills he'd taken.

933
00:39:41,953 --> 00:39:43,698
Some are never
heard from again.

934
00:39:43,698 --> 00:39:45,293
But some get released.

935
00:39:45,293 --> 00:39:47,534
For the last week,
it's basically been giving him

936
00:39:47,534 --> 00:39:50,011
Massive doses
of all three at once.

937
00:39:54,687 --> 00:39:55,886
And that...

938
00:39:55,953 --> 00:39:58,587
Is why I won't let cameron
buy a cat.

939
00:39:59,228 --> 00:40:00,608
He should be fine.

940
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,821
Are you glad
he told you the truth?

941
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:08,230
Yes...of course.

942
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,796
But...

943
00:40:12,286 --> 00:40:14,768
Were you happier
before you knew?

944
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:25,374
About ten more feet.

945
00:40:25,374 --> 00:40:26,949
I do know
what it looks like,

946
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:28,674
So maybe this whole
blindfold thing--

947
00:40:28,674 --> 00:40:30,266
Shh--My gift,

948
00:40:30,266 --> 00:40:31,330
My rules.

949
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,520
Bump.

950
00:40:32,587 --> 00:40:34,564
All right, if you don't like
the color,

951
00:40:34,564 --> 00:40:35,798
Apparently we can
exchange it.

952
00:40:35,798 --> 00:40:36,952
But I'm hoping.

953
00:40:36,953 --> 00:40:38,886
You ready?

954
00:40:45,086 --> 00:40:47,262
Do you like it?

955
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:55,789
Baby, are you okay?

956
00:41:04,453 --> 00:41:06,320
We need to talk.

957
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:31,978
She didn't buy it.

958
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,486
Damn.

959
00:41:35,386 --> 00:41:37,225
So you didn't get anything.

960
00:41:37,675 --> 00:41:38,719
Nothin'.

961
00:41:38,786 --> 00:41:40,969
We probably overstepped.

962
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:43,186
You're really not
the cheerleader type.

963
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:45,086
On the other hand,

964
00:41:45,153 --> 00:41:48,741
I figured she probably
wouldn't figure me as the "photoshopping

965
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:52,041
"A photo and planting it
in an obscurecollege paper" type either.

966
00:41:52,484 --> 00:41:54,048
Heh, yeah.

967
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:55,336
About that.

968
00:41:56,687 --> 00:41:59,121
I took a little trip
to your alma mater.

969
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,952
You took a little trip 150 miles.

970
00:42:04,952 --> 00:42:06,568
Online, by phone.

971
00:42:06,568 --> 00:42:08,796
I meant I did research.

972
00:42:14,147 --> 00:42:15,933
That's a real photo,
isn't it?

973
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:20,817
Wow, that is humiliating.

974
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:24,719
There was a girl.

975
00:42:26,153 --> 00:42:27,819
Even more so.

976
00:42:27,886 --> 00:42:29,539
That's too bad.

977
00:42:29,539 --> 00:42:31,435
You wanted her to see you
in a different light,

978
00:42:31,435 --> 00:42:33,819
And...not only
didn't she see it...

979
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:36,557
She didn't even believe
it was possible.

980
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:41,267
You know,
people hate people who have theories
about people.

981
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:51,906
You want me to back off?

982
00:42:52,097 --> 00:42:53,140
Would you?

983
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:55,674
I barely know you.
