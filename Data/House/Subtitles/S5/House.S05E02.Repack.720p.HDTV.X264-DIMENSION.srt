1
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:39,534
Bring it up
about six more feet.

2
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:43,000
Okay, you can go ahead
and start dropping it.

3
00:00:49,198 --> 00:00:51,065
Whoa.

4
00:00:51,131 --> 00:00:53,031
Whoa!

5
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:13,532
Rico!

6
00:02:12,677 --> 00:02:13,543
Class is over.

7
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:16,710
What's going on?
Who are you?

8
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:18,378
I'm a doctor.

9
00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:20,144
Did you have a corneal
transplant five years ago?

10
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:21,543
Yes.

11
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,311
Every other patient who had
a transplanted organ

12
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:24,577
From that donor
is either dead or dying.

13
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,543
You got a purse?

14
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:31,077
I feel fine.

15
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:33,577
I don't mean to scare you,
but so did the others.

18
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,443
One living, one almost dead.

19
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,111
Four fully dead.

20
00:03:13,177 --> 00:03:15,378
Nothing in common
except their donor.

21
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:16,944
Carl got a new heart
and lung.

22
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:18,344
Liver kills him.

23
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,299
Tibalt got a new liver,
lung killed him.

24
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:23,877
Holly got a new kidney,
her heart blows up.

25
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:25,577
And frank, the old guy
gasping for breath upstairs,

26
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:28,877
He got an intestinal graft,
his pancreas is failing.

27
00:03:28,877 --> 00:03:30,576
All within eight months
of each other.

28
00:03:30,576 --> 00:03:32,877
And in each case, serious
complications came on suddenly

29
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:33,908
And without warning.

30
00:03:33,908 --> 00:03:35,189
Which means arrhythmia,

31
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:37,576
Massive pulmonary embolus,
or cerebral bleed.

32
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:39,744
What did wilson do
for me?

33
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:44,377
If the donor had

34
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:46,111
An infection that somehow
slipped by a screening,

35
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:47,510
It could lay dormant-

36
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:48,689
Five organ systems hit.

37
00:03:48,689 --> 00:03:49,877
Would need five infections

38
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:51,745
For it to somehow slip
by screening.

39
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,977
Oh, sure, he made me laugh
on a rainy day,

40
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:56,844
Made me see the colors
i never knew-

41
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,344
None of the donated organs
were hit.

42
00:03:58,411 --> 00:03:59,977
It means whatever they got
came from the donor's blood.

43
00:04:00,044 --> 00:04:01,111
That wouldn't help us narrow
down what-

44
00:04:01,177 --> 00:04:02,211
It narrows down who.

45
00:04:02,278 --> 00:04:03,444
Corneal transplants
are bloodless.

46
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:04,844
It means
apple's gonna be fine.

47
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,077
You secure enough
in that theory to send her home?

48
00:04:07,144 --> 00:04:09,244
I guess we could wait
till we figure out

49
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:10,244
What's wrong with frank.

50
00:04:10,311 --> 00:04:12,177
On the other hand,

51
00:04:12,244 --> 00:04:13,877
Gilbert gottfried
makes me laugh.

52
00:04:13,944 --> 00:04:15,578
And how many colors
are there really?

53
00:04:15,645 --> 00:04:17,645
Once you got red, blue,
and green-

54
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,518
He paid for your lunch,
liked monster trucks,

55
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:20,315
And was your conscience.

56
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:21,252
Autoimmune disease.

57
00:04:21,252 --> 00:04:23,144
A.N.A. At autopsy
of all four victims were normal.

58
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:24,977
Wouldn't cover vasculitis.

59
00:04:25,044 --> 00:04:25,830
Henoch-Schonlein purpura-

60
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,977
Antiphospholipid antibodies,
normal.

61
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:29,211
Then that leaves cancer.

62
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:31,278
Cancers have names.
They have a progression.

63
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:32,944
They affect
specific organs.

64
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,877
Bone cancer can't turn
into liver cancer.

65
00:04:34,944 --> 00:04:36,111
Forget cancer.

66
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:39,177
It's cancer.

67
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:40,611
It's not cancer.

68
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:42,244
You're right,
of course.

69
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:43,611
What was i thinking?

70
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:45,611
No single type of cancer
blew up three organs

71
00:04:45,678 --> 00:04:46,777
In the chest
while also herniating

72
00:04:46,844 --> 00:04:47,745
In the fighter's brain stem.

73
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,777
The fighter's irrelevant.

74
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:50,144
You don't like coincidences.

75
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:52,478
It would be a coincidence
if six transplant recipients

76
00:04:52,544 --> 00:04:53,711
Had nothing else wrong
with them-

77
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:55,044
Like being an idiot,
which leads to getting

78
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:56,378
Your head knocked off.

79
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:57,777
The others had cancer.

80
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:00,111
Four autopsies
and about 1,000 lab tests say

81
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:01,378
It's not cancer.

82
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:03,444
Redo the thousand tests
and the four autopsies.

83
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,344
Taub and kutner,
check out the donor.

84
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:07,044
Find out which cancer-
He didn't die of cancer.

85
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:08,244
His head got chopped off

86
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:09,745
In an industrial accident.

87
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,444
Find out which cancer
would have killed him.

88
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:13,645
Check the home and office
for carcinogens, toxins-

89
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,077
He's been dead
for four years.

90
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:16,977
I assume his home's been rented
to someone else by now.

91
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:19,278
Find out which cancer
killed them.

92
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:23,211
Did i forget you?

93
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:25,278
You can check out
the patient's eye.

94
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:38,678
Put this on dr. O'shea.

95
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:41,678
And some chips.

96
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:42,777
Forget your wallet,
house?

97
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:45,080
No.

98
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:48,814
I'll take care of it.

99
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:51,278
Check.

100
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:54,511
Are you following me?

101
00:05:54,578 --> 00:05:58,877
Word is you're
into monster trucks.

102
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:01,244
My kids like it.
But not you?

103
00:06:01,311 --> 00:06:02,645
Predator's okay,

104
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:04,752
But i think the california
crusher is overrated.

105
00:06:11,236 --> 00:06:14,049
Are you checking me out?

106
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:15,127
You're astute.

107
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:18,344
No. How many pills did you just take?

108
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,177
Vicodin, opioids,
some b12.

109
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:24,244
Need a little kick
in the afternoon.

110
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:25,940
You got a problem
with that?

111
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:29,278
I think
i'm falling in love.

112
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:30,544
Her right eye's failing.

113
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:32,444
No, it's not.

114
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:34,611
Everyone else's
transplanted organs were fine.

115
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:35,645
It means her eye
is fine.

116
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:36,678
We need to remove
the eye.

117
00:06:36,745 --> 00:06:39,344
It's her only working eye.

118
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:41,278
We could remove the other one,
but since it's not killing her,

119
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:42,986
I thought this way
was less insane.

120
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:47,044
Do you have
some ethical problem

121
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:48,344
With what i'm doing
that you could express

122
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,278
In a unique way
which might actually make me

123
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:52,815
Think that i'm wrong
even though i'll never admit it?

124
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:53,689
Yes.

125
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:56,205
You are funny.

126
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:58,810
The problem's not in her eye.
It's in her head.

127
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,611
You wanna come over
and watch prescription passion

128
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:02,810
At my place tonight?

129
00:07:02,877 --> 00:07:04,044
You know
i'm not gay, right?

130
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:06,011
Neither am i.

131
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:07,977
If you don't want to have sex,
that's cool with me.

132
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:09,311
I'm not coming over
to your home.

133
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:11,111
I'll grow on you.

134
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:19,478
L... p... e...

135
00:07:19,544 --> 00:07:21,144
Do i have to be
in the same room as him?

136
00:07:21,211 --> 00:07:23,077
Whatever he's got,
you've got.

137
00:07:23,144 --> 00:07:24,344
Fifth line.

138
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,411
Are you sure?

139
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,578
Pretty sure.

140
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:28,252
Fifth line.

141
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:33,252
Am i gonna die?

142
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:35,511
Can we talk about something
besides you for a moment?

143
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:38,002
Like maybe the fifth line?

144
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:43,377
F... e... o... s... p.

145
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:46,777
Damn.

146
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:48,044
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:48,111 --> 00:07:49,311
We need to remove
your eye.

148
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:50,711
My eye?

149
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:52,745
A moment ago,
you thought you were dying.

150
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,977
Blind's actually good news.

151
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:56,711
Unfortunately,
he's wrong.

152
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,111
You just did the test.

153
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,478
She didn't squint.

154
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:00,910
Which means the eye thinks
it's fine.

155
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:03,011
It was wrong. I know.
The eye doesn't think.

156
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:05,211
The brain thinks, which means
if the thinking's wrong,

157
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:06,311
The brain's wrong.

158
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:07,844
Which means it's spread
to the brain,

159
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,745
Which means it's too late
for us to remove the eye.

160
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,311
Which means we're gonna have
to remove your whole head.

161
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:18,877
Don't worry.
It doesn't hurt.

162
00:08:24,314 --> 00:08:25,893
Allucination

163
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:27,736
That's a brain thing, right?

164
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,169
500 different things
can cause hallucination.

165
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,968
Doesn't mean
it's neurological.

166
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:36,768
It does if one of
the other organ recipients

167
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:38,436
Also had a brain issue.

168
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:41,868
Did he just drop
had brain issues. Hands?Them

169
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:43,668
If his pupils dilated,

170
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:45,402
If his pupils were fixed,
if there was a twitch...

171
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:46,335
He got hit in the head,

172
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:48,069
He died,
no mystery.

173
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:49,202
That was your point.

174
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,469
Yesterday.

175
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:51,402
You live,
you learn.

176
00:08:51,469 --> 00:08:53,035
Who shot this?

177
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:54,601
Guy who runs the gym
has a camera.

178
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:57,335
Uploads the nasty stuff
online.

179
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:00,235
Can't see
the dead guy's face.

180
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:03,436
I can't see his face,
can't see the twitch,

181
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,857
Can't see the pupils-

182
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:06,668
We know the tennis player
had a heart problem.

183
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:10,436
We can maybe tie that
to the tuba player's lungs,

184
00:09:10,502 --> 00:09:11,601
And then somehow tie
both those things,

185
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:13,035
To the construction worker's
liver,

186
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:14,335
And then possibly meander

187
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:16,002
Over to frank's
pancreatic failure,

188
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:19,835
But nothing causes simultaneous
brain and heart problems.

189
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:21,269
Cancer made no sense.

190
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:23,635
The head and heart
make less than no sense.

191
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:24,502
That makes no sense.

192
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:25,735
Um.

193
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:29,135
I know.

194
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,069
I was making
a point.

195
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,968
Oh, good.
I thought you were an idiot.

196
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,102
Why are you talking?

197
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:41,544
Oh, the guy doing manual labor
can't have an opinion?

198
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:45,493
I might be a genius
who just happens to have

199
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:48,202
A passion
for fixing coffee machines.

200
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:50,102
No, i'm obviously not,
but that's rude

201
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:51,302
To make assumptions
about people.

202
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:54,402
Donor's history came up clean.

203
00:09:57,335 --> 00:09:58,635
Did he just laugh?

204
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:00,069
No, no, i sneezed.

205
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:02,335
He's a genius coffee repairman.

206
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,732
Coffee repairman
who wears argyle socks?

207
00:10:06,544 --> 00:10:08,335
I thought i already talked
about not judging.

208
00:10:10,002 --> 00:10:12,269
What kind of idiot
wears argyle socks

209
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:14,469
With construction boots?

210
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:15,868
Uh, i'm not an idiot.

211
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:19,735
I'm just-I'm not good
at disguises.

212
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:21,802
Who is he?

213
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:24,802
He's apparently a very bad
private investigator.

214
00:10:24,868 --> 00:10:27,102
Uh, why is he pretending
to fix the coffee machine?

215
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,601
Because i wanted to find out
what you guys found out

216
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:31,502
Before i find out
what he found out.

217
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:34,668
So i can find out if i need
a private investigator.

218
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,502
So, nu?

219
00:10:36,568 --> 00:10:38,269
There's no history
of unusual infections,

220
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:40,997
No international travel
in the 12 months-

221
00:10:44,536 --> 00:10:46,669
No, seriously,
that's how i sneeze.

222
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,968
He was in madrid
and the bahamas.

223
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:52,868
Credit card receipts
showed no-

224
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,968
Girlfriend paid.
There is no girlfriend.

225
00:10:55,035 --> 00:10:56,768
She was
his high school sweetheart.

226
00:10:56,835 --> 00:10:58,302
High school sweetheart
is married to his best friend.

227
00:10:58,369 --> 00:10:58,981
I know.
Shh.

228
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:01,635
She had a kid four years ago.

229
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:02,935
Timing fits.

230
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:03,935
She's still pretty hot
though.

231
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:05,202
You find out anything
medical?

232
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:06,635
The kid has a tummy ache.

233
00:11:06,701 --> 00:11:11,069
Also, the dead guy was exposed
to mercury, mold,

234
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:12,968
And hydrous perchloric acid

235
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:14,735
Because their sex pad
was next to a garage

236
00:11:14,802 --> 00:11:16,802
That was demolished
after those toxins were found.

237
00:11:16,868 --> 00:11:18,668
Oh, yeah,
that will be

238
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:21,469
$2,300.

239
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:24,235
I'll get you
a check.

240
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:25,635
No, i don't take checks.

241
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,469
You think
i'm gonna stop payment?

242
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:29,335
Aren't you?
Of course, i am.

243
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:31,469
$2,300.
That's insane.

244
00:11:31,536 --> 00:11:33,835
Actually, that price includes
footage of the boxing match

245
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,202
From four different angles.

246
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,968
30% of the crowd
paid by credit card.

247
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:38,269
I got their names.

248
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:39,568
Four of them had
digital cameras,

249
00:11:39,635 --> 00:11:41,102
Which i composited
like nasa did

250
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,436
For the pics of mars.

251
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,968
You know, the rovers
and all that.

252
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:50,536
Pupils were dilated.

253
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:51,835
But he didn't drop his hands,

254
00:11:51,902 --> 00:11:53,135
Which means he maintained
muscle tensity-

255
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:54,635
Say it.

256
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:56,235
You were right.

257
00:11:56,302 --> 00:11:57,735
God, that was petty
of me.

258
00:11:57,802 --> 00:11:59,035
He maintained muscle tensity,

259
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:00,802
But was momentarily distracted
when he got hit.

260
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:02,135
That's a temporal lobe seizure.

261
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:03,835
Does that p.I. Guy mean
we don't have to break

262
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:05,135
Into people's homes anymore?

263
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:06,902
It's the whole reason
you went to medical school.

264
00:12:06,968 --> 00:12:08,102
I'm not gonna take that
away from you.

265
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:09,369
He's better
than we are.

266
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,235
And costs more.
Gonna biopsy the brain.

267
00:12:11,302 --> 00:12:12,835
No.

268
00:12:12,902 --> 00:12:13,902
Say it.

269
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:15,568
You were right,
but no.

270
00:12:15,635 --> 00:12:18,402
Temporal lobe
controls speech,

271
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:19,436
Hearing, memory.

272
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:21,568
She loses those things,

273
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:22,469
She's gonna be
a terrific date,

274
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:23,356
But beyond that-

275
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,302
We cut out a piece of it,
good chance she's a vegetable.

276
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,701
Nothing to hear,
nothing to say,

277
00:12:26,768 --> 00:12:27,802
Nothing to look back on.

278
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:29,436
You're right.

279
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:31,169
She has so much
to live for.

280
00:12:31,235 --> 00:12:34,135
Do we have another patient
who's almost finished

281
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:35,607
With all their living?

282
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:37,701
So it's okay to stab his brain
because he's old?

283
00:12:37,768 --> 00:12:39,835
No, it's okay to stab
his brain

284
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:41,601
Because he's dead
if you don't.

285
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:43,857
Get the widow
to say yes.

286
00:12:45,768 --> 00:12:46,868
No.

287
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:48,302
The lung inflammation is
a complication

288
00:12:48,369 --> 00:12:49,568
Of the pancreatic failure,

289
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,369
Which is reversible.

290
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,902
This is actually
his best chance.

291
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,232
If we can find out
what's wrong...

292
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,269
How can a test
that will probably kill him-

293
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:57,335
I didn't say-

294
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,802
You said
it was extremely risky.

295
00:12:58,868 --> 00:12:59,768
What does extremely mean?

296
00:12:59,835 --> 00:13:01,232
Please.

297
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:06,035
I'm sorry.
I can't.

298
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:07,668
I have a husband.

299
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:09,302
I have a two-Year-Old
daughter.

300
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:10,768
Her name is julia.

301
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:12,607
You'd be saving
her mother.

302
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:16,202
I think you're lying.

303
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:18,294
You haven't had one visitor.

304
00:13:18,294 --> 00:13:20,044
Not one phone call
since you've been here.

305
00:13:20,044 --> 00:13:22,069
Does she have a child?

306
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:26,493
No.

307
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:28,138
But her life
is still worth-

308
00:13:28,138 --> 00:13:29,235
More than my husband's?

309
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:31,102
I lied to save my life.
Wouldn't you?

310
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:33,235
Not at another human being's
expense.

311
00:13:33,302 --> 00:13:34,235
No, you'd just rob me
of my only chance

312
00:13:34,302 --> 00:13:35,335
So your husband can struggle

313
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:36,469
To breathe
for a few more days.

314
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:37,802
Just shut up.

315
00:13:37,868 --> 00:13:39,601
I don't want to hear from you. Ladies.

316
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:41,069
You want to hate me so you
won't feel guilty. Shut up!

317
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:42,302
Frank?

318
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:43,635
Give me a scalpel.

319
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:45,102
Frank.

320
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:51,069
Charge.

321
00:14:00,469 --> 00:14:01,668
He's coding.

322
00:14:03,469 --> 00:14:04,402
Clear.

323
00:14:05,768 --> 00:14:08,502
Clear.

324
00:14:08,568 --> 00:14:09,668
Frank!

325
00:14:09,735 --> 00:14:11,868
Clear.

326
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,635
Clear.

327
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:24,868
Did you get
the consent?

328
00:14:24,935 --> 00:14:26,436
No.
Tell foreman to get it.

329
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:28,369
Old people are scared
of black people.

330
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:30,135
It won't matter.
Patient's dead.

331
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:35,302
Sa the brain.

332
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,369
Don't need consent
for an autopsy.

333
00:15:02,478 --> 00:15:06,322
Well, at best, we're gonna bat
one for six on this one.

334
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,791
Thin slices
through the parietal

335
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:08,923
And temporal lobes
were clean.

336
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:11,322
Occipital and
frontotemporal regions

337
00:15:11,322 --> 00:15:11,603
Were also-

338
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:13,857
Brain's clean.
Moving on.

339
00:15:13,923 --> 00:15:14,681
To where?

340
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:17,223
We've gone from making no sense,
to making less sense,

341
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,624
And then taken
a step backwards.

342
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,056
Each of these people
were killed by one thing

343
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:22,857
That attacked one organ.

344
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,424
But never the same organ.

345
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,857
Could the donor have had
two things wrong?

346
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:27,390
Or six things wrong?

347
00:15:27,457 --> 00:15:30,791
Metabolic diseases specialize.

348
00:15:30,857 --> 00:15:32,257
Everything else specializes,

349
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:33,323
But cancer plays
the field.

350
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,690
You're back to cancer?

351
00:15:34,757 --> 00:15:37,457
Metastasis is just a fancy word
for screws around.

352
00:15:37,524 --> 00:15:38,857
Any type of cancer?

353
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:40,157
I don't know.

354
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:41,424
There would be evidence
of cancer.

355
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,357
There is.
We just haven't found it yet.

356
00:15:43,424 --> 00:15:44,824
You need it to be cancer
so you have an excuse

357
00:15:44,891 --> 00:15:45,990
To talk to wilson.

358
00:15:46,056 --> 00:15:47,257
Give me something else

359
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:49,624
That explains this constellation
of patients,

360
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,724
Then you can call me
an ass.

361
00:15:50,791 --> 00:15:51,923
I didn't call you an ass.

362
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,457
Perforated intestine.

363
00:15:54,524 --> 00:15:55,990
If this thing started
as normal bacteria

364
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,590
Living in the intestines

365
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,190
But got into a blood vessel

366
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:01,690
Through a vascular anomaly
in the bowel wall,

367
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:04,123
Then they would affect every
organ through the blood stream.

368
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,791
It screws up everything.
For everyone.

369
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:09,657
Okay.

370
00:16:09,724 --> 00:16:12,666
It's a long shot,
it is possible i'm an ass.

371
00:16:13,478 --> 00:16:16,123
Ironically, we need to do
a colonoscopy to confirm.

372
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,357
We checked apple inside and out

373
00:16:17,424 --> 00:16:19,223
When she came in;
she's clean.

374
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,524
The anomaly would have to be
intermittent

375
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,791
Or they all would have died
within a day.

376
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:23,590
She starts getting
abdominal pain,

377
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:26,457
Shove a tube up her rear
before it can get away.

378
00:16:26,524 --> 00:16:27,824
And test anyone else
with stomach pain.

379
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:29,257
Everyone else is dead.

380
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,657
Not everyone.

381
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:32,457
The one thing the donor gave
to each of these people

382
00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:34,257
Is his dna.

383
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:37,624
Anyone else
have his dna?

384
00:16:39,478 --> 00:16:40,857
You want to do a colonoscopy

385
00:16:40,923 --> 00:16:42,123
On a healthy four-Year-Old?

386
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,490
She has a tummy ache.

387
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:45,056
If kutner's right,
it's not a tummy ache,

388
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:50,190
It's a fatal brain or heart or
lung or liver or pancreas ache.

389
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:52,290
I'm not gonna scare the hell
out of the poor kid's mom

390
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:54,757
Because of a long shot corollary
to a long shot theory.

391
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,824
Fine

392
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,090
Tell her the truth.

393
00:16:59,157 --> 00:17:02,724
Then ask if daddy knows
who the real daddy is.

394
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:18,923
Does she have to be awake?

395
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,978
We need her to tell us
when it hurts.

396
00:17:23,724 --> 00:17:25,056
She'll get over it.

397
00:17:25,123 --> 00:17:28,824
Your husband might not have.

398
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:37,157
What if a kid wants
ice cream?

399
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,956
The sign outside
says 'closed.'

400
00:17:40,023 --> 00:17:41,990
Dr. O'shea's not right
for you.

401
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:43,056
What'd you find out?

402
00:17:43,123 --> 00:17:45,071
Why are you
investigating him?

403
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,490
'Cause i need to know
if he lends money interest-Free.

404
00:17:49,557 --> 00:17:51,157
What did you find out?

405
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:53,923
I want some ice cream.

406
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:57,790
Not until you learn
to read.

407
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:01,524
You're supposed
to trust friends.

408
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,357
I don't know the guy.

409
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:03,457
I got no logical reason-

410
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:04,791
To be his friend?

411
00:18:04,857 --> 00:18:06,490
Have you never seen
an after-School special?

412
00:18:06,557 --> 00:18:08,724
That is part of the pleasure
of friendship:

413
00:18:08,791 --> 00:18:10,490
Trusting
without absolute evidence

414
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,963
And then being rewarded
for that trust.

415
00:18:12,963 --> 00:18:14,590
You're taking pictures
of a guy

416
00:18:14,657 --> 00:18:16,290
Who's having an affair
with his own sister.

417
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:18,290
And you're lecturing me
about the rewards of trust.

418
00:18:18,357 --> 00:18:20,824
There are two types of people
that hire me.

419
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,857
No, actually,
there are three types

420
00:18:21,923 --> 00:18:22,791
Of people that hire me,

421
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,509
But the third type's irrelevant
to the point i want to make.

422
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:27,025
Do you have a special rate plan
for being a pain in the ass?

423
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:29,103
One type wants to find out
that they're right,

424
00:18:29,103 --> 00:18:30,403
One type wants to find out
that they're wrong.

425
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,836
Which type am i?

426
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,470
You're the third type.

427
00:18:33,537 --> 00:18:35,237
You lead
with the irrelevant types?

428
00:18:35,303 --> 00:18:36,736
You're the type that doesn't
care if you're right or wrong

429
00:18:36,803 --> 00:18:38,836
Because they've hired me
to investigate the wrong person.

430
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:40,070
That's an actual type?

431
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:41,537
You want me
to check out wilson.

432
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:44,203
You want to find out
if he's-

433
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,303
How do you know about wilson?

434
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,736
What do i do for a living?

435
00:18:46,803 --> 00:18:48,728
Have you been checking me out?

436
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,237
I've been paying for that?

437
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:54,437
So far,
you haven't paid for anything.

438
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:55,470
You want to find out
he's pining;

439
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:56,836
You want to find out

440
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,203
If there's something
about him

441
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,503
That will tell you
he's gonna come back

442
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,056
Or something you can use
to make him come back.

443
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:08,070
Is there?

444
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:12,070
No, no, there's nothing.

445
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:13,403
Sorry.

446
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:20,670
That will be $900.

447
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:27,803
I gotta go.

448
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,604
I'll get you a check.

449
00:19:39,203 --> 00:19:40,503
Colonoscopy was clean.

450
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,437
Then that just leaves cancer.

451
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:44,203
The fact that the kid's
colonoscopy was negative

452
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,503
Doesn't prove anything.

453
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:48,103
Yes, the fact
that it didn't prove anything

454
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,103
Didn't prove anything.

455
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,181
Excellent point.

456
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:51,637
We don't know
if the kid inherited anything.

457
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:53,103
Even if she did,

458
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,704
Kutner's theory is that
the thing's intermittent.

459
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:57,103
The opening would have
to be open shortly before death.

460
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,936
Unfortunately, we can't know
when shortly before death is

461
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:01,437
Until shortly after death.

462
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:02,903
And that seems
like an obstacle.

463
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,337
What if there was a way
around that?

464
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,170
Then we're kind of all sweating
over nothing.

465
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:10,070
Not around death,
around death as an obstacle.

466
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:12,237
We need to see his colon
at work.

467
00:20:12,303 --> 00:20:14,537
You do know
what death means, right?

468
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,036
Without a living system,

469
00:20:16,103 --> 00:20:18,070
There's not enough pressure
to get fluid all the way up.

470
00:20:18,136 --> 00:20:21,736
Life we can't create, yet,
but pressure's easy.

471
00:20:22,803 --> 00:20:24,228
We use the same high pressure
water jet

472
00:20:24,228 --> 00:20:26,118
We use to test
cardiac workload.

473
00:20:28,736 --> 00:20:30,736
I mean, he's not gonna be awake
to tell us where it hurts-

474
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:33,056
It's not gonna-
Do it.

475
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:52,936
It's kinda stuck.

476
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,303
It's more than stuck.

477
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,036
The bowel's been dead
for six hours.

478
00:20:56,103 --> 00:20:58,790
No matter what
you shoot up there, it's closed.

479
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,503
This is nuts.

480
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,170
It's adjustable.

481
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,537
It's working.

482
00:21:18,604 --> 00:21:20,836
Yeah. Wow.

483
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,494
Not much.
Increase the pressure.

484
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:29,541
The endoscope's bowing.
Push on the stomach.

485
00:21:33,136 --> 00:21:34,103
Those are normal
bodily fluids.

486
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,070
Yeah, normal bodily sewage.

487
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:37,728
Put the pressure
back on.

488
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,353
That's the end.
No leaks.

489
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:46,353
Wait.

490
00:21:46,353 --> 00:21:46,994
What's that?

491
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:48,503
That's just dark
'cause i'm at the end.

492
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,437
What if you're not
at the end?

493
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:50,903
What if it's a core lesion?

494
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,936
Maybe a little more pressure?

495
00:21:53,003 --> 00:21:55,570
Not too much.

496
00:21:55,637 --> 00:21:56,537
If it is the end and we-

497
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:05,607
It's finally accelerating.

498
00:22:05,674 --> 00:22:08,325
Apple's heart rate
has become irregular.

499
00:22:08,325 --> 00:22:09,774
Breathing is labored.

500
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:12,028
Colonoscopy's still showing
no leaks.

501
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:13,387
What if it is autoimmune?

502
00:22:13,387 --> 00:22:16,966
What if we don't have
conversations we've already had?

503
00:22:16,966 --> 00:22:18,133
Four out of the five
didn't linger.

504
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,999
They got sick
and died.

505
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:22,500
We don't have time to dismiss
things we've already dismissed.

506
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:23,899
Nothing fits.

507
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:25,800
See, that's an example
of a conversation

508
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:27,066
We've already had.

509
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:28,933
She's sick.
Something fits.

510
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,633
Ms?
No!

511
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,767
Okay, from now on,
no one says anything

512
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,367
Unless no one's said it
before.

513
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,166
Where are you going?

514
00:22:46,233 --> 00:22:47,700
You guys start
immuno-Gels

515
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:51,033
On her csf to look
for hidden protein markers.

516
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Then start sequencing
her genes.

517
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,133
I'm gonna start treatment.

518
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,133
Treatment for what?

519
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:54,715
Cancer.

520
00:22:54,715 --> 00:22:56,767
It's not cancer.
Chemo's toxic.

521
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,667
It's something.

522
00:22:58,734 --> 00:23:01,033
Which means we should treat her
for something.

523
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,403
She's fine.
Where's her chart?

524
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:22,500
You rang emergency
to get her chart?

525
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,567
I know.
That was bad of me.

526
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:24,774
But i'm pretty sure

527
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:26,033
The chart's supposed to be
attached to the bed

528
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,433
So that gimp doctors

529
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,533
Don't have to look
all over the place

530
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,903
While patients die.

531
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,866
Thank you so much.

532
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:40,325
And some peppermint tea
when you get a chance.

533
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,400
I need you
to sign something.

534
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:51,467
Consent
to chemotherapy.

535
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,153
You found cancer?

536
00:23:54,263 --> 00:23:55,233
No.

537
00:23:56,325 --> 00:23:58,637
Then you have tests
indicating-

538
00:23:58,637 --> 00:23:59,513
Nope.

539
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:00,367
Then why should i sign it?

540
00:24:00,433 --> 00:24:02,300
That's a good question.

541
00:24:02,367 --> 00:24:04,667
It deserves
a complicated answer.

542
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,633
Placebo effect.

543
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,834
People have confidence
in doctors,

544
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:12,667
They have confidence
in diagnoses,

545
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,500
Confidence in medicine.

546
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:15,633
Sometimes they get
a little better

547
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,667
Just because they think
they will.

548
00:24:17,734 --> 00:24:19,300
And that can make us think

549
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:20,866
That the wrong answer
is the right answer.

550
00:24:20,933 --> 00:24:22,800
Which is very bad.

551
00:24:24,028 --> 00:24:26,467
So you do have proof
that it's cancer

552
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:29,433
But you can't tell me
because it might affect

553
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,400
The way i react
to the medicine?

554
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:34,834
If that were true, and it would
certainly make sense,

555
00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:37,637
Do you think i could tell you
that it's true?

556
00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:50,106
I was practically blind
before the transplant.

557
00:24:50,999 --> 00:24:52,467
2200 vision.

558
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,999
Didn't you cover all this
personal stuff with dr. Foreman?

559
00:24:55,066 --> 00:24:58,266
You don't care
who i used to be?

560
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,133
You're a post-Corneal transplant
math teacher.

561
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,033
I deduced that you were
a blind math teacher.

562
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,467
I was an architect.

563
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,633
You gave up architecture
after you could see?

564
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,400
The world was ugly.

565
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,734
You think the world would be
any different

566
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,654
If your leg was fine?

567
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,200
No.

568
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:27,012
Think you'd be any different
if your leg was fine?

569
00:25:29,075 --> 00:25:32,433
I mean, the doctors told me
that my life was gonna be

570
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,800
So much better
once i could see.

571
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,800
I would date,

572
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,997
I would dance,

573
00:25:37,997 --> 00:25:41,166
But, uh, the guys
i hated dancing with before

574
00:25:41,233 --> 00:25:42,800
I hate dancing with after.

575
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:45,266
My parents were still dead.

576
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,966
I was still alone.

577
00:25:48,033 --> 00:25:50,166
You're fun.

578
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:51,667
You don't seem
all that different.

579
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:59,033
I haven't given up.

580
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:05,367
Wilson's got a new job,
hasn't started yet, but-

581
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,800
So who are we following?

582
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:08,600
See that lady up there?

583
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,100
You point at the target?

584
00:26:10,166 --> 00:26:11,266
No, i'm following the one

585
00:26:11,333 --> 00:26:12,500
Halfway in between that point

586
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:13,899
And that point.

587
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,899
Oh.
Pretty.

588
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:20,567
Who hired you?

589
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:21,999
No one.
I just like her.

590
00:26:22,066 --> 00:26:23,800
You're stalking her?

591
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:26,500
No, no, i followed her out
of that bookstore back there.

592
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:30,433
You are stalking her,
just not for very long.

593
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,700
So what else can you tell me
that i might care about?

594
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:36,433
He attends this grief counseling
thing twice a week

595
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,433
Where they go around
the room

596
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,133
And cry about who's dead.

597
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,767
Cameron's been to his house
several times,

598
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,966
They just talk about death

599
00:26:44,033 --> 00:26:46,044
And losing loved ones.

600
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,999
What-

601
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,133
What are you-

602
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,567
If she turns her head,

603
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:04,899
She's gonna see that we're
walking the wrong direction.

604
00:27:04,966 --> 00:27:05,899
No, no, no,
she won't.

605
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:06,866
I'm very nondescript.

606
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,133
Well, i'm not.

607
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,600
Well, then you stay
four feet behind me.

608
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,500
How do you know
what they're talking about?

609
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:14,899
I'm in the same
grief counseling group.

610
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,100
I recently lost
my mother.

611
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,266
You'd get laid more often
if you told them

612
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,333
You lost a kid.

613
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,800
I didn't lose a kid.

614
00:27:20,866 --> 00:27:22,533
You're a p.I.
Who can't lie?

615
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,800
I can lie.

616
00:27:23,866 --> 00:27:26,166
I'm just not all that good
at it.

617
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:28,667
Well, dr. Cuddy's been over
to wilson's twice

618
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,066
And phoned
a bunch of times.

619
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:31,762
Foreman called him.

620
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:34,066
And the rest of the time
wilson's been reading

621
00:27:34,133 --> 00:27:37,333
Meditation books and magazines
about restoring barns.

622
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,834
Are you following me?

623
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:39,767
No.

624
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:40,866
Are you lying?

625
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:42,467
No.
Yes.

626
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:44,567
???Commit.

627
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:46,033
It's making me
uncomfortable.

628
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,533
Sorry.

629
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:51,533
You're very pretty.

630
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,866
More uncomfortable.

631
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:56,400
She's not your type.

632
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:59,033
Your type is much stupider
than her.

633
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,533
What did wilson say
about me?

634
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,767
Oh, you've never come up.

635
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:05,400
In the grief counseling
or in the other-

636
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:06,800
Anywhere,
i got three bugs in his home

637
00:28:06,866 --> 00:28:07,866
And one in his car.

638
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,133
If i didn't know you,

639
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,667
I wouldn't even know
you existed.

640
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:12,866
Which is good news.

641
00:28:12,933 --> 00:28:14,300
Only two things you ignore-

642
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:15,013
Things that aren't important

643
00:28:15,013 --> 00:28:17,033
And things you wish
weren't important.

644
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,400
And wishing never works.

645
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,266
She's better.

646
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:35,866
I can tell at once.

647
00:28:35,933 --> 00:28:37,767
Vomiting's a side effect
of the chemo.

648
00:28:37,834 --> 00:28:40,166
Her heart rate's stabilized,
breathing's good.

649
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:42,333
Amylase and triglycerides
are both coming down.

650
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,100
I guess it's working.

651
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,467
Can't believe it.
It's cancer.

652
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:48,866
It's not cancer.

653
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:02,413
Labs show that our patient
is healthier.

654
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,513
She's gonna get sicker.

655
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,046
Then she's gonna die.

656
00:29:06,113 --> 00:29:07,747
I brought thal food.

657
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,046
What did you see in her?
Nothing.

658
00:29:09,113 --> 00:29:10,513
It's not cancer.

659
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,700
All the tests say
it's not cancer.

660
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,137
They've always said
it's not cancer.

661
00:29:13,137 --> 00:29:15,113
Treatment proves
it's cancer.

662
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,780
Eh, treatment proves
it could be cancer.

663
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:17,946
It's not cancer.

664
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:19,450
This was your diagnosis.

665
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:20,341
I never thought
it was cancer.

666
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,029
You treated
for cancer.

667
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,596
I thought that what she had
acted like cancer.

668
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:26,130
If it acts like cancer,
maybe it'll respond like cancer.

669
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,496
It did.
'Cause it's cancer.

670
00:29:27,562 --> 00:29:30,590
We have to find something
that walks like cancer,

671
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,562
Talks like cancer,

672
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:34,825
Tastes like cancer,
but isn't cancer.

673
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:35,496
No, we don't.

674
00:29:35,562 --> 00:29:37,450
Better is better.
Who cares why?

675
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,063
I do.

676
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,762
And so does tetrault.

677
00:29:39,762 --> 00:29:41,309
Who?

678
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:43,075
The dead tuba player.

679
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:44,138
Tibalt.

680
00:29:44,138 --> 00:29:46,471
The point is,
he died last,

681
00:29:46,538 --> 00:29:47,638
But he died.

682
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,471
Which means
she's gonna die too.

683
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,305
Tibalt wasn't receiving
cancer medication.

684
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:52,438
There's a cancer drug

685
00:29:52,505 --> 00:29:54,171
That's used off-Label
for arthritis.

686
00:29:54,238 --> 00:29:55,572
There's no record
of arthritis.

687
00:29:55,638 --> 00:29:57,438
Did you interview
all the tuba students?

688
00:29:57,505 --> 00:29:58,338
If he had joint pain
in his hands,

689
00:29:58,405 --> 00:29:59,338
He couldn't have played.

690
00:29:59,405 --> 00:30:00,771
Then it wasn't in his hands.

691
00:30:00,837 --> 00:30:01,771
Then why do we care
about his students?

692
00:30:01,837 --> 00:30:03,238
One of them is canadian.

693
00:30:03,305 --> 00:30:06,305
Brought him methotrexate
so he could hide his arthritis.

694
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,071
Already couldn't afford
his insurance.

695
00:30:08,138 --> 00:30:11,205
And that little piece
of business cost me $700.

696
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:13,405
I'm gonna pass it on to the
patient with a steep mark-Up.

697
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:15,071
This makes no sense.

698
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:17,071
I know.

699
00:30:17,138 --> 00:30:19,871
She's dead unless we can find
what's cancer...

700
00:30:19,938 --> 00:30:22,071
But not cancer.

701
00:30:29,071 --> 00:30:31,004
Something's missing.

702
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:38,038
I need an epiphany.

703
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:42,104
What are you billing
out at?

704
00:30:42,171 --> 00:30:43,538
$300 an hour?

705
00:30:43,605 --> 00:30:45,171
Here's four.

706
00:30:45,238 --> 00:30:47,004
There are other oncologists.

707
00:30:47,071 --> 00:30:48,104
Better oncologists.

708
00:30:48,171 --> 00:30:49,434
But i need you.

709
00:30:54,405 --> 00:30:55,438
Let me describe
the symptoms,

710
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,572
Problems, issues,

711
00:30:57,638 --> 00:30:59,338
And say whatever
you feel like saying,

712
00:30:59,405 --> 00:31:01,305
Until something triggers
an idea in my head.

713
00:31:01,371 --> 00:31:02,605
That's not the way
it works.

714
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:04,038
You have a way
of thinking about things.

715
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:06,004
It's sloppy,
it's undisciplined,

716
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:07,538
It's not very linear.

717
00:31:07,605 --> 00:31:09,004
It complements mine.

718
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:10,950
It drives me down avenues
that i wouldn't otherwise-

719
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,825
House, please go away.

720
00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:15,012
Cancer, but not cancer.

721
00:31:15,012 --> 00:31:17,338
Responds to cancer treatment,
but there's no-

722
00:31:23,438 --> 00:31:24,471
How are you?

723
00:31:25,903 --> 00:31:26,771
Don't do this.

724
00:31:26,837 --> 00:31:29,471
Please.

725
00:31:29,538 --> 00:31:31,205
Don't do this.

726
00:31:31,271 --> 00:31:33,371
I'm trying to move on.

727
00:31:35,325 --> 00:31:37,104
By hanging out
with cameron,

728
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:39,171
Talking to cuddy,
foreman,

729
00:31:39,238 --> 00:31:40,371
But not me.

730
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:50,771
I paid a private investigator
to spy on you.

731
00:31:53,071 --> 00:31:54,104
You didn't.

732
00:31:54,171 --> 00:31:55,305
You want to move on from me,

733
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,638
You got to deal with me,
talk to me.

734
00:31:56,704 --> 00:31:58,138
You had no right-

735
00:31:58,205 --> 00:31:59,538
We're not friends anymore.

736
00:31:59,605 --> 00:32:01,071
There's no trust
to be breached.

737
00:32:01,138 --> 00:32:02,538
I can have you followed,

738
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:04,871
I can call you names,
tell your secrets.

739
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:10,071
Foreman did a ct.

740
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:12,505
Temporal and frontoparietal
regions are normal.

741
00:32:12,572 --> 00:32:13,904
Occipital lobe, normal.

742
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:17,004
I have the right
to walk away from you, house.

743
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:18,918
There's a world beyond you.

744
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:22,171
You need to realize that,
and even if you don't,

745
00:32:22,238 --> 00:32:23,605
I'm moving on.

746
00:32:23,672 --> 00:32:25,505
The next time you knock,

747
00:32:25,572 --> 00:32:26,971
I'm not answering.

748
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:33,075
Nothing yet.
Keep talking.

749
00:32:43,804 --> 00:32:45,171
I'm sorry.

750
00:32:45,238 --> 00:32:49,438
You charge me for listening in
on my own conversations?

751
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:51,505
Ha.
Yeah, why wouldn't i?

752
00:32:51,572 --> 00:32:52,700
How many friends
do you have?

753
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:53,371
17.

754
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,538
Seriously?

755
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:57,071
You have a list?

756
00:32:57,138 --> 00:32:59,305
No, i knew this conversation
was really about you,

757
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:00,804
So i just gave you
an answer

758
00:33:00,871 --> 00:33:01,938
So you could get back
to your train of thought.

759
00:33:02,004 --> 00:33:03,971
Well done.

760
00:33:04,038 --> 00:33:05,837
I have one.
Had one.

761
00:33:05,904 --> 00:33:07,205
You know,
friends are important.

762
00:33:07,271 --> 00:33:08,804
You're gonna miss-
Shut up.

763
00:33:08,871 --> 00:33:12,205
Friends allow you to not sit
in a room by yourself.

764
00:33:12,271 --> 00:33:13,205
Are you charging me
for this?

765
00:33:13,271 --> 00:33:14,405
Are we friends?

766
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:16,004
No.
Then yes.

767
00:33:16,071 --> 00:33:18,505
Do you wanna be
my friend?

768
00:33:18,572 --> 00:33:19,837
No.
You scare me a little.

769
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:21,572
He thinks if he's not a friend,
he can't talk to me.

770
00:33:21,638 --> 00:33:23,804
We can talk, we can be
two human beings talking-

771
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:24,971
I'm with him.

772
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:25,871
Sorry.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

773
00:33:25,938 --> 00:33:27,038
Yes, you did.

774
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:28,271
I was in the middle
of a sentence.

775
00:33:28,338 --> 00:33:31,004
Yes, i did.
You're repeating yourself.

776
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:33,171
I'm grateful.
Make your point.

777
00:33:33,238 --> 00:33:34,238
It's like that
"cancer, but not cancer" thing

778
00:33:34,305 --> 00:33:35,205
You were talking about
before.

779
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:36,305
Friends are friends,

780
00:33:36,371 --> 00:33:37,971
Customers are customers,

781
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:39,471
And everything else
is everything else.

782
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:42,205
If it's not,
nothing's nothing.

783
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:47,762
And anything can be anything.

784
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:53,271
10:10. Stop the clock.
What?

785
00:33:53,338 --> 00:33:57,004
The world is not as ugly
as she thinks it is.

786
00:34:02,138 --> 00:34:04,513
Cancer, but not cancer.

787
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,438
Doesn't make any sense
unless...

788
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,438
Brain, but not brain.

789
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:13,171
Occipital lobe's normal.

790
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:14,271
But her eyes suck.

791
00:34:14,338 --> 00:34:15,938
That lobe should be
compensating.

792
00:34:16,004 --> 00:34:17,837
Since it's not, that tells me
that something's in there

793
00:34:17,904 --> 00:34:20,137
That shouldn't be in there.

794
00:34:20,137 --> 00:34:22,871
Brain, but not brain.

795
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:23,904
Why are you
in my office?

796
00:34:23,971 --> 00:34:25,171
To find the anomaly,

797
00:34:25,238 --> 00:34:27,405
I need to chop off
the top of her head.

798
00:34:27,471 --> 00:34:29,572
Pretty sure i need
your approval for that.

799
00:34:29,638 --> 00:34:32,505
I'm gonna trust
your first instinct.

800
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,104
I'm not usually confused
when you say things like that.

801
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:38,171
I'm ordering her cancer
treatment to be continued.

802
00:34:39,938 --> 00:34:42,938
Why does it cost $2,300
to fix a coffee machine?

803
00:34:43,004 --> 00:34:45,338
Cancer stem cells
are real.

804
00:34:45,405 --> 00:34:46,971
They explain everything.

805
00:34:47,038 --> 00:34:48,605
They're like embryonic
stem cells.

806
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:49,471
They become whatever
they want.

807
00:34:49,538 --> 00:34:50,471
Donor had them,

808
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:52,138
The recipients got them.

809
00:34:52,205 --> 00:34:54,271
They floated around,
they landed on an organ,

810
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:56,737
Got bathed in cytomes
and partially differentiated.

811
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,338
And the key word there
is partially.

812
00:34:58,405 --> 00:35:01,471
In the tuba player,
they became lung, but not lung.

813
00:35:01,538 --> 00:35:03,438
In the tennis player, they
became heart, but not heart.

814
00:35:03,505 --> 00:35:05,405
Stop me if you've figured out
the pattern.

815
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:06,638
They looked as if they belonged,

816
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:07,771
But they weren't doing
their jobs.

817
00:35:07,837 --> 00:35:08,605
And when they were
really needed,

818
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,138
Boom.

819
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:13,405
Chemo worked because cells
are basically tumors.

820
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:14,840
Chemo shrunk them.

821
00:35:17,919 --> 00:35:19,371
You're still gonna say no,
aren't you?

822
00:35:19,438 --> 00:35:20,438
You've no proof.

823
00:35:20,505 --> 00:35:21,804
I have the brain scan.

824
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,471
The normal brain scan.

825
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,505
This is why
i need to take off her head.

826
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:27,038
Treat or to prove
you're right?

827
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,605
To treat.

828
00:35:28,672 --> 00:35:30,871
Chemo's not killing
anything.

829
00:35:30,938 --> 00:35:32,305
It's just hiding
the real problem.

830
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:33,438
She's gonna crash.

831
00:35:33,505 --> 00:35:35,171
If we wait
until she does crash,

832
00:35:35,238 --> 00:35:36,704
It might be too late.

833
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:39,971
So the next step is what?

834
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,205
I say no, and then
you do something

835
00:35:41,271 --> 00:35:42,771
To make her crash

836
00:35:42,837 --> 00:35:45,071
So that i'll think
you've proven your theory?

837
00:35:45,138 --> 00:35:46,305
I would never do that.

838
00:35:46,371 --> 00:35:47,825
No, you won't.

839
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,825
* to change the world *

840
00:36:10,405 --> 00:36:13,013
* start with one step *

841
00:36:15,538 --> 00:36:18,138
* however small *

842
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:22,637
* the first step
is hardest of all *

843
00:36:24,338 --> 00:36:27,387
* once you get your gait *

844
00:36:29,038 --> 00:36:31,825
* you'll be walking tall *

845
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:37,325
* you said you never did *

846
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:41,325
* 'cause you might die tryin' *

847
00:36:48,038 --> 00:36:49,715
* 'cause you *

848
00:36:53,038 --> 00:36:56,137
* if you close your eyes *

849
00:36:57,638 --> 00:37:00,403
* because the house is on fire *

850
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:05,340
* and think you couldn't move *

851
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:09,935
* until the fire dies *

852
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:12,904
* the things you never did *

853
00:37:12,971 --> 00:37:15,013
She's crashing!

854
00:37:16,271 --> 00:37:19,153
* 'cause you might die tryin' *

855
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:23,075
* 'cause you might
die tryin' * *

856
00:37:55,332 --> 00:37:58,065
You might want to check
her iv.

857
00:37:58,132 --> 00:38:03,823
From here, it looks like saline
instead of chemo.

858
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,073
Yeah, they look identical.

859
00:38:06,073 --> 00:38:07,973
Still.
You should probably check.

860
00:38:11,107 --> 00:38:12,774
You switched
her meds?

861
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:14,741
How could i?
I had no access.

862
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:16,374
Close her back up.

863
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:17,541
Do the surgery.

864
00:38:17,607 --> 00:38:19,474
There's no reason to-

865
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:20,908
No reason not to.

866
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:23,140
The stupidly dangerous part
is already over with.

867
00:38:23,207 --> 00:38:26,140
We're ready
with the neural net.

868
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:49,574
Is that someone's brain?

869
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:51,573
Except for the part
that isn't brain.

870
00:38:56,874 --> 00:38:58,908
Hey, that's the patient i-

871
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:02,674
You said
she'd be fine.

872
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,240
I'm a better liar
than you are.

873
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:06,474
I swapped her meds.

874
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:07,474
I mean, she's got
a brain problem.

875
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,641
I coulda killed her.

876
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:10,541
Yup.

877
00:39:10,607 --> 00:39:12,040
The neural net will show us

878
00:39:12,107 --> 00:39:14,541
How fast
her neurons are firing.

879
00:39:14,607 --> 00:39:15,940
If there's something
in the way,

880
00:39:16,007 --> 00:39:18,674
Say...
brain that's not brain,

881
00:39:18,741 --> 00:39:20,940
The normal neural impulses
will be sucked

882
00:39:21,007 --> 00:39:22,174
Into a vortex

883
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,908
Because they're not able
to do their job.

884
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:26,240
The computer
will then process it

885
00:39:26,307 --> 00:39:27,474
And give us a picture
of where to cut.

886
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:29,707
Cool.

887
00:39:29,774 --> 00:39:31,908
Excuse me?

888
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:33,674
Sorry, i thought
that's what you wanted to hear.

889
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:37,240
You think all this
is amazingly cool.

890
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:41,541
And you have no one else, so
you're paying a guy to listen.

891
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:44,973
Sorry-Just trying to save you
some cash.

892
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,240
I'm on the clock.

893
00:39:46,307 --> 00:39:47,441
Yeah, why wouldn't you be?

894
00:39:47,507 --> 00:39:49,276
You think
this is interesting to me?

895
00:39:49,276 --> 00:39:51,340
House?

896
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:52,973
I see it.

897
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,973
Can you get it?

898
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,374
I think so.

899
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:57,940
Turns out
you didn't kill her.

900
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:01,741
Cool.
You owe me $5,000.

901
00:40:17,507 --> 00:40:19,973
Why are you just standing there,
dr. House?

902
00:40:23,174 --> 00:40:24,973
How'd you know
who it is?

903
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,073
I can smell you.

904
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,641
Yeah, like you're
a field of roses.

905
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,374
Peppermint tea.

906
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:41,007
You ever hear
of the boy who cried wolf?

907
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:43,652
Never really bought that.

908
00:40:43,652 --> 00:40:45,574
I don't care
how often a kid cries,

909
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:48,027
He's being eaten by a wolf,
mom's gonna come running.

910
00:40:51,808 --> 00:40:56,007
The world is ugly.

911
00:40:56,073 --> 00:40:57,307
People kill.

912
00:40:57,374 --> 00:41:00,374
They go hungry.

913
00:41:03,774 --> 00:41:05,198
Just proving a point.

914
00:41:10,707 --> 00:41:12,340
People are asses.

915
00:41:12,407 --> 00:41:13,874
Why are you telling me
this stuff?

916
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,207
Because the world
is not as ugly

917
00:41:15,274 --> 00:41:16,641
As you think it is.

918
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:20,073
Your transplanted cornea's fine,
your eye is fine,

919
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,240
But your brain
wasn't working right.

920
00:41:23,307 --> 00:41:25,541
I'm gonna take
the gauze off your eyes now.

921
00:41:25,607 --> 00:41:27,741
It's gonna be bright.
I know.

922
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:30,774
The brain cells
that weren't brain cells

923
00:41:30,841 --> 00:41:35,240
Were in the way of processing
visual information correctly.

924
00:41:35,307 --> 00:41:36,707
After the transplant,
you could see,

925
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:38,073
But not see.

926
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,207
I could see.

927
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:40,441
I could read.

928
00:41:40,507 --> 00:41:44,107
Yeah, but it was dull,
or foggy, or gray.

929
00:41:44,174 --> 00:41:45,574
I don't know.

930
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:48,307
What i do know
is that yowere not seeing

931
00:41:48,374 --> 00:41:49,407
What everyone else
was seeing.

932
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:51,274
And now?

933
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,174
Things are gonna be...
beautiful?

934
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,741
Things'll be
what they are.

935
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,574
How do i look?

936
00:42:26,073 --> 00:42:27,541
You look sad.

937
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,107
Hey.

938
00:42:52,174 --> 00:42:54,808
Is there any way
i could put you on retainer?
