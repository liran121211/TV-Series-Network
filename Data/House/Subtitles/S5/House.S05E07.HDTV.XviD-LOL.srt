00:07:17,559 --> 00:07:18,643
Don't care
about the bug bite.

181
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:21,104
She's your boss.

182
00:07:21,187 --> 00:07:22,814
So now I have two reasons
to ignore her.

183
00:07:25,275 --> 00:07:26,401
It was just a kiss.

184
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:28,236
There's a reason.

185
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,947
Yes. Those large things
in her bra.

186
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,490
You were hiding it from me

187
00:07:32,574 --> 00:07:34,659
means it meant something
to you.

188
00:07:34,742 --> 00:07:36,119
Yeah, I fiendishly
concealed it

189
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,996
within the phrase
"I hit that."

190
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,455
Stop scratching.
You'll draw blood.

191
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,457
Finally you said
something useful.

192
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,959
If I actually break
the skin,

193
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:44,919
it'll let
the poison out.

00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:16,701
We aren't engaged.

215
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:20,788

<i>A year and a half.</i>

We spend most nights
together.

222
00:08:29,463 --> 00:08:30,714
There's a bunch of drugs

223
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:32,675
that can lower a seizure
threshold.

224
00:08:32,716 --> 00:08:35,010
And cloud the diagnosis
with side effects.

00:08:36,262 --> 00:08:37,263

Interesting.

228
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:39,431

what the answer.

230
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:41,600

231
00:08:41,684 --> 00:08:42,810

235
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,985
Yeah, moves much faster
this way.

236
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:54,863
Where was the patient
when he had his first seizure?

237
00:08:54,947 --> 00:08:56,323
In his entry hallway

00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:57,700
<i>getting his mail.</i>

239
00:08:57,783 --> 00:09:00,411
Getting close to the outdoors
spooked him,

00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:01,912
<i>raised his BP.</i>

241
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:03,288
<i>Use that fear.</i>

242
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:04,456
Bring him outside.

243
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,749
He punched out a fireman.

<i>We're doctors,</i>
<i>not bouncers.</i>

245
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:11,672
Okay. So bring the outside
to him.

246
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:16,385

247
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:18,762
Why are they here?

248
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:21,848
They overheard me announce
the half price bank foreclosure

249
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:23,559
in the ER waiting room.

250
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,685
Where's everybody?

251
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:26,770
Cameron's
with the patient.

252
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:28,855
Uh, everybody else
went home.

253
00:09:28,939 --> 00:09:30,691
Because they don't need
to be here.

254
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,318
Neither do you.
And yet you are.

255
00:09:33,402 --> 00:09:35,112
This way.

257
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:40,617
Original? They were here
before the house.

258
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:44,746
The shut-in's
also original.

259

Come on.
Don't be shy.

260

263
00:09:53,964 --> 00:09:55,090
This is cruel.

264
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:56,591
<i>And leaving him undiagnosed</i>

00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:07,185
Normal theta.
Normal delta.

269
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:08,645
This isn't a seizure.

270
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:09,980
It's something.

272
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,025
Stomach's killing me.

273
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:16,152
See? It's something.

<i>(Kutner)</i>
<i>Partial small bowel obstruction.</i>

276

Blockage explains

277
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:33,654
What explains
the blockage plus seizures?

278
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:35,656
Atrial fibrillation

<i>unless we get him in</i>

<i>which he won't let us do.</i>

285
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,375
Wouldn't.

Whatever your

it's caused a complication

Since we're in mixed company,
"S" is stool.

Nothing's coming out

00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,234
so the pain's
gonna get worse and worse.

297
00:11:12,317 --> 00:11:14,069
We need to stick
a pooper scooper in you.

298
00:11:14,152 --> 00:11:16,196
We also need to take a look
at your bowel.

299
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:18,240
I made my wishes clear.

300
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:20,158
Uh-huh. And if the crazy fairy

00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:31,003
Except now you're

Not as bad.
Nowhere near.

307
00:11:32,713 --> 00:11:33,881
We can give him drugs
for the blockage.

308
00:11:33,964 --> 00:11:35,299
And if it doesn't work?

309
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:38,051
That blockage will rupture
your intestines,

310
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:40,387
spew sewage throughout
your body.

311
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,847

00:11:44,057 --> 00:11:47,853

00:12:15,797 --> 00:12:17,341
Chase won't actually--

322
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:21,094
He's not gonna do surgery
in some crazy dude's house.

323
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:22,971
You just said--
what I said was that

324
00:12:23,013 --> 00:12:24,473
Chase would put him under
at the house,

325
00:12:24,515 --> 00:12:25,641
we'd take him
to the hospital,

326
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:26,683
open him up,
do our thing,

327
00:12:26,725 --> 00:12:27,976
then slip him back
into his room

328
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:29,228
for the post-op

329
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,563
without him ever finding out
that we tricked him.

330
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:32,940
Some of that was implied.

331
00:12:33,023 --> 00:12:34,149
It's unethical.

332
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:35,484
He'll be asleep.

333
00:12:35,526 --> 00:12:36,693
He gets to make
his own calls

334
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,694
even if he's asleep.

335
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:39,530

with him?

Oh, yeah, you're that girl
who likes broken people

337
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:43,367
because her husband died.

338
00:12:43,408 --> 00:12:44,743
And since Chase isn't
all that broken--

339
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:46,328
Hey, why don't we operate
on his infarcted leg

341
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:48,664

358
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:11,455
<i>It's no big deal.</i>

359
00:14:11,497 --> 00:14:13,332
<i>He's a friend.</i>

360
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:14,833
And I leaned on him.

361
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:16,168
It's funny.

362
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:17,586
I've leaned on friends
in the past.

363
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:21,590
Never leaned so far my tongue
fell into their mouths.

364
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:25,052
I don't think of House
that way.

365
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:26,970
I never have.

366
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:30,349
Why not?

367
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:33,977
You know exactly
how it would go.

368
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:35,354
It'd start off exciting.

369
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:37,856
We'd get caught up
in the novelty and the hostility

370
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,982
and the
forbidden forbidden-nessness.

371
00:14:39,066 --> 00:14:41,360
<i>And then we'd realize</i>

372
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:43,195
that the flirty hostility
is just hostility

373
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:45,113
and his inability
to open up

374
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:47,574
is no longer exciting,
it's just frustrating.

375
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:50,285
And--and then it's
the inevitable blowup

376
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:51,912
and the recriminations

377
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:55,165
and we don't talk
for two months.

378
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:58,627
Yeah.

379
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,003
Well, it certainly proves

380
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:01,505
you've never thought
about House that way.

381
00:15:04,842 --> 00:15:06,176
I get your point.

382
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,178
I will be more careful
with my tongue in the future.

383
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,596
<i>That's not my point.</i>

384
00:15:09,638 --> 00:15:13,475
Maybe novelty and hostility
and forbidden-ness

385
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,436
doesn't have to end bad.

386
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:21,567
[pager beeps]

387
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:23,485
Gotta go.

388
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,446
What time you done?

389
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:27,447
We could try
that new sushi place

390
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:28,657
next to my house.

391
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,409
Why don't we stay
at my house tonight?

392
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,994
We always stay
at mine.

393
00:15:32,077 --> 00:15:34,121
That's what I mean.
We--we used to split it.

394
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:35,873
What happened?
I don't know.

395
00:15:35,956 --> 00:15:37,749
Closer to work.
- By five minutes.

396
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,334
And my house doesn't look
like it was decorated

397
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:41,211
by a drunk rugby player.

398
00:15:41,295 --> 00:15:43,463
Well, we can discuss it.
- I hadn't really--

399
00:15:43,547 --> 00:15:45,048
Why does it have
to be a discussion?

400
00:15:45,132 --> 00:15:46,091
Can't you just
stay over?

401
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:49,052
You do know

402
00:15:49,136 --> 00:15:51,471
they page me when that much
surgical equipment

403
00:15:51,513 --> 00:15:53,765
is signed out.

404
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:54,808
<i>He didn't consent.</i>

405
00:15:54,892 --> 00:15:55,934
He consented
to the surgery.

406
00:15:55,976 --> 00:15:57,477
You think he's gonna
sue over where?

407
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:59,271
He won't even know where.
He'll wake up in his house.

408
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:00,647
<i>He won't know a thing</i>
<i>about what happened.</i>

409
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:02,107
Until he catches
a post-surgical infection

410
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:04,234
in his dirty apartment
and finds out we tricked him

411
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:05,485
and winds up owning
the hospital.

412
00:16:05,527 --> 00:16:08,614
Why aren't you arguing
with her?

413
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:11,241
Because she's right.

414
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:12,826
<i>I don't care where he gets</i>
<i>the post-op,</i>

415
00:16:12,868 --> 00:16:14,328
Just that he gets it.

416
00:16:14,363 --> 00:16:15,287
Keep him here.

417
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,129
House.

418
00:16:24,213 --> 00:16:25,339
You okay?

419
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,966
Yes.
We don't need to talk.

420
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,134
Your hand.

421
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:32,888
Huh. That's weird.

422
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:36,683
I usually don't get
the stigmata until Easter.

423
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:43,398
Please tell Dr. Chase
the patient's ready for him now.

424
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,245
Stewart, wake up.

425
00:16:56,328 --> 00:16:58,956
<i>It's Dr. Cameron.</i>

426
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,292
If you can hear me, blink.

427
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:05,671
We were concerned
for your safety

428
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:07,631
so we brought you
to the hospital.

429
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:12,761
No, it's okay.

430
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:14,054
Why--why?

431
00:17:14,096 --> 00:17:15,639
<i>No, it's okay.</i>
- Why...

432
00:17:15,722 --> 00:17:17,057
I just wanted
to keep you informed.

433
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,392
I didn't want you
to have a bad shock

434
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:19,768
while you were recovering
from surgery.

435
00:17:19,852 --> 00:17:21,228
Gotta get outta of here.
[machine beeps]

436
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,521
It's okay, Stewart.
Calm down.

437
00:17:22,604 --> 00:17:24,439
Calm down. Stewart.
[machine beeping]

438
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:26,191
Stewart,
I'm gonna sedate you.

439
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:27,818
[machine beeping]
I'm gonna sedate you.

440
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:29,236
No!

441
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,612
Calm down.

442
00:17:30,654 --> 00:17:32,573
Ah!
- I need some help in here!

443
00:17:32,614 --> 00:17:33,824
Damn it!
Somebody get in here!

444
00:17:33,907 --> 00:17:35,784
[machine beeping]

445
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,334
What did you do?

446
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,155
<i>(Cuddy)</i>
<i>Well done.</i>

447
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,448
Your patient
called his lawyer,

448
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,449
threatened to sue us.

449
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:55,576
He's now heading home

450
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:56,785
completely undiagnosed.

451
00:17:56,827 --> 00:17:59,121
He'll soon be
on his way back.

452
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:00,956
He's sick.

453
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,457
He'll crash.
He'll lose consciousness.

454
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,084
I'll declare an emergency,
bring him back in.

455
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,170
Not anymore you won't.

456
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,589
His lawyer now holds
his health care proxy.

457
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,090
The next time we have
an emergency,

458
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,467
Larry Ruseckas, Esquire,
will be calling the shots.

459
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,844
<i>(Cameron)</i>
<i>I made the right call.</i>

460
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,387
If he'd flipped out
after major surgery,

461
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,097
it would've been worse.

462
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,641
The benefit of being boss
is that I don't have to argue.

463
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:22,060
You're all off the case.

464
00:18:32,404 --> 00:18:33,989
What's going on between
you and Cuddy?

465
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:35,365
Bad lovin' gone bad.

466
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,867
Seriously. Why didn't
you argue with her?

467
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:38,076
She just threw us
off the case.

468
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,453
Because ignoring her
is a lot easier.

469
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,580
Convince the patient
to let us back in again.

470
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,707
See if you can clear
his blockage with lactulose.

471
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:46,376
If this thing kills him
before we can diagnose,

472
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:49,588
it won't be fun anymore.

473
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,089
Okay.

474
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,091
You gonna keep
working on this?

475
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,760
Yeah. I brought in
the case.

476
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,220
There is no case.
He's gone.

477
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,930
You've been tossed.
This is totally nuts.

478
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,681
He's incredibly sick.
We don't know--

479
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:02,142
Forget about the patient.
What is going on with you?

480
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:03,602
This is why we left
House's team

481
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:05,687
to avoid this constant flood
of pure craziness.

482
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,482
That's why I left House.
You got fired.

483
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,948
I'm sorry.
I know I let you down.

484
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,282
But you know who else
I let down,

485
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:21,578
pretty much everyone
who's important to me.

486
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:24,957
My boss, my old boss,

487
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,960
my boyfriend.

488
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:31,421
I did that for you.

489
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:36,677
I'm not gonna
let you down again.

490
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:52,651
<i>It's like the red badge</i>
<i>of idiocy.</i>

491
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,362
If the confederacy
had mosquitoes,

492
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,866
we'd all have southern accents
and I'd be paying Foreman less.

493
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:01,827
She kicked you
off the case.

494
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,329
<i>This is what happens</i>
<i>when you don't address it.</i>

495
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,291
She acts weird,
things get different.

496
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:11,712
You understand that different
implies difference.

497
00:20:11,795 --> 00:20:14,006
She's tossed me
a million times before.

498
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,300
<i>No, she always</i>
<i>chastises you.</i>

499
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,385
And you'd always come running
to me to complain.

500
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:19,761
So you're acting
different too.

501
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:21,889
You're scared.

502
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,891
You are scared
to get involved.

503
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:26,310
How is that "scared"?

504
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,228
It's rational.

505
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:29,855
Emotionally mature people

506
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,941
<i>who work together</i>
<i>should not date.</i>

507
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:34,735
Guaranteed breakup.
Guaranteed ugliness.

508
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,570
Any relationship
that doesn't end in a breakup

509
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,779
ends in death.

510
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,406
Everything falls apart
in the end.

511
00:20:39,448 --> 00:20:40,866
That's your worldview.

512
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,868
The corollary,
which you keep forgetting,

513
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,829
is that you have to grab
any chance for happiness.

514
00:20:45,913 --> 00:20:47,706
Why does this matter
so much to you?

515
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:50,083
Cuddy and I are fine.

516
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,085
The only person
getting worked up here is you.

517
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,921
I don't want you
to be fine.

518
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,506
I want you to be happy.

519
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,382
I think if you dated her---

520
00:20:57,424 --> 00:21:00,260
Are you familiar
with the adverb "vicariously"?

521
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,054
If I wanted to ask her out--

522
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,305
<i>You did ask her out.</i>

523
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,599
Last year.
Whatever happened there?

524
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,935
I don't know.
I wasn't interested.

525
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,979
Wrong. You were interested.

526
00:21:11,063 --> 00:21:12,773
But Amber grabbed
your genitals first.

527
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,192
<i>But now you're single,</i>
<i>and that makes you miserable</i>

528
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,361
because you think it's too soon
for another relationship.

529
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:19,530
So you're gonna
make me miserable.

530
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:22,866
Please, get a girlfriend,
or a life, or something.

531
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,076
For me.

532
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:28,288
<i>Better or worse?</i>

533
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:30,624
<i>(Cameron)</i>
<i>Worse. Drugs aren't working.</i>

534
00:21:30,707 --> 00:21:32,167
<i>I think we should do</i>
<i>the surgery in his house</i>

535
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:33,460
<i>like we planned.</i>

536
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:35,170
Well, then one of us
wasn't paying attention

537
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:37,172
because i thought that surgery
thing was just a trick.

538
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:38,674
We prepared the room.
We Hung the drapes.

539
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:39,967
It's probably ten times
as sterile

540
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,176
as any mobile
operating theater

541
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,219
you'd find in a battlefield.

542
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,137
We still need Trapper John.

543
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:46,348
Chase doesn't want
anywhere near this surgery.

544
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,016
<i>Maybe you could talk</i>
<i>to him.</i>

545
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,352
I can't understand
a word he says. Taub.

546
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,105
Doing anything later?

547
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:56,316
Blood in the field.

548
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,403
Not where I'm looking.

549
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,029
How am I supposed
to know where you're looking?

550
00:22:01,071 --> 00:22:03,115
Here's a hint.
It's the bloody part.

551
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:04,283
<i>The whole thing's</i>
<i>bloody.</i>

552
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:05,784
<i>It's a guy with a hole</i>
<i>in his body.</i>

553
00:22:05,868 --> 00:22:07,286
It's like you've never
done this before.

554
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,370
Use the suction.
I will.

555
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:10,038
And in fact I've
never done this before

556
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:12,583
because I went to med school,
not nurse school.

557
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:15,085
Hey, wanna see if your client's
actually made of money?

558
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,837
Cutting out last piece
of bowel.

559
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:23,260
Suture.

560
00:22:26,138 --> 00:22:27,514
Mucosa's pink.

561
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:30,017
<i>Flattened villi.</i>

562
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,435
Intestinal atrophy.

563
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,061
<i>It's Whipple's Disease.</i>

564
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:35,731
Explains the seizure
and the stomach pain.

565
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:36,940
Little bleeder here.

566
00:22:37,024 --> 00:22:38,442
Cautery.

567
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:41,987
Hey, wait.
The gas--

568
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,322
[gas flares]

569
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:52,789
That always happens
during surgery.

570
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,958
Just the gas buildup
in the blockage.

571
00:22:55,042 --> 00:22:56,460
Nothing to sue about.

572
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,086
Treat him for the burns.

573
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,630
<i>Put him on antibiotics</i>
<i>for the Whipple's.</i>

574
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:01,298
He'll be fine.

575
00:23:10,766 --> 00:23:13,936
Hey. That's nice
of you.

576
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,145
Hi.

577
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,274
He doing good?

578
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:22,444
Uh, burns are healing fine.
He's stable otherwise.

579
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:23,737
Good.

580
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,822
So, uh, I could stay
at your place tonight

581
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,324
<i>if you'd like.</i>
- I can't.

582
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,286
Well, you're not gonna

583
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,496
<i>sleep here again.</i>

584
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,623
You might have noticed
the lack of nurses.

585
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:36,834
<i>Because you're not</i>
<i>on the case.</i>

586
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:39,211
You can't really use that
as an excuse...

587
00:23:39,294 --> 00:23:40,420
<i>(Nozick)</i>
<i>Dr. Cameron!</i>

588
00:23:40,504 --> 00:23:42,130
Wait here.

589
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:47,219
Your stomach?

590
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:49,137
My legs are numb.

591
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,098
I can't feel them at all.

592
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,604
New symptom.
Peripheral neuropathy.

593
00:23:56,646 --> 00:23:58,189
Got worse on antibiotics.
It's not Whipple's.

594
00:23:58,273 --> 00:23:59,274
<i>(Kutner)</i>
<i>Porphyria.</i>

595
00:23:59,315 --> 00:24:00,108
<i>(Thirteen)</i>
<i>Liver's fine.</i>

596
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:01,192
Amyloidosis.

597
00:24:01,276 --> 00:24:02,694
We would've seen it
on the intestines.

598
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:05,071
What did we see
on the intestines?

599
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:07,365
<i>Pink mucosa,</i>
<i>flattened villi.</i>

600
00:24:07,448 --> 00:24:09,284
<i>It's not Whipple's,</i>
<i>it's gotta be Celiac.</i>

601
00:24:09,325 --> 00:24:11,369
Wheat allergy means
he's not absorbing nutrients.

602
00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:13,454
Explains the seizures,
stomach, and now the nerves.

603
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:15,039
<i>(Thirteen) We should run
a blood test for Celiac.</i>

604
00:24:15,123 --> 00:24:17,917
Not fast enough.
Not accurate enough.

605
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:19,419
Force-feed him wheat

606
00:24:19,502 --> 00:24:22,088
<i>then do an endoscopy</i>
<i>as it hits his duodenum.</i>

607
00:24:22,172 --> 00:24:24,007
See if there's an allergic
reaction.

608
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:25,675
His test just exploded.

609
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:27,886
It might be a tad painful
to make him eat.

610
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,345
That's House's point.

611
00:24:29,387 --> 00:24:30,680
<i>There's nothing diagnostic</i>
<i>about it.</i>

612
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:31,848
<i>He's trying to put</i>
<i>the patient in pain,</i>

613
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,016
force him to come in.

614
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:34,726
It is a valid test.

615
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,644
So is the blood test,
which is painless.

616
00:24:36,686 --> 00:24:40,648
<i>(House) Foreman, listen to
that little voice in your head</i>

617
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,567
that's coming
from the telephone.

618
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,860
Force-feed him.

619
00:24:43,902 --> 00:24:46,029
Don't. You know House.

620
00:24:46,112 --> 00:24:47,197
You know I'm right.

621
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,783
We'll do both tests.

622
00:24:58,374 --> 00:25:00,502
I'm not here to play
matchmaker.

623
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:02,003
Okay.

624
00:25:02,045 --> 00:25:04,088
House basically...

625
00:25:04,172 --> 00:25:08,384
<i>well, he accused me</i>

626
00:25:08,426 --> 00:25:10,053
of being interested
in you.

627
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:13,306
Oh, he's just trying
to change the subject.

628
00:25:13,389 --> 00:25:14,516
I know.

629
00:25:14,557 --> 00:25:18,895
But I do have...

630
00:25:18,978 --> 00:25:20,146
I've always...

631
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,440
<i>had...</i>

632
00:25:22,524 --> 00:25:24,651
some feelings for you.

633
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:28,738
Are you saying
you want to date me?

634
00:25:28,821 --> 00:25:32,492
No. I-I--it wouldn't
be fair to House

635
00:25:32,575 --> 00:25:34,828
and it's too soon
after Amber.

636
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:38,873
But you thought
you should just say it.

637
00:25:38,957 --> 00:25:40,041
<i>Yeah.</i>

638
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:41,918
I thought you should know.

639
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:46,631
Let's have dinner
tomorrow night.

640
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:52,095
Okay.

641
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:54,806
Or maybe it would be better
if we just...

642
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:56,307
had sex.

643
00:25:57,809 --> 00:25:58,893
Pardon me?

644
00:25:58,977 --> 00:26:00,728
In front of House's office.

645
00:26:00,812 --> 00:26:02,063
I mean, I don't want
to take any chances.

646
00:26:04,315 --> 00:26:06,317
I assume the point of this
is to make him jealous

647
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,569
and make him realize
that he does want

648
00:26:07,652 --> 00:26:09,988
a relationship with me?

649
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:13,158
Yes.

650
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:14,367
You think it'll work?

651
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,286
You're an idiot.

652
00:26:16,327 --> 00:26:17,662
Trust me.

653
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:19,038
Everybody will be happier

654
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:21,082
if House and I
aren't dating.

655
00:26:30,842 --> 00:26:32,927
You sure this is
the best test?

656
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:35,096
No. But you've kind
of tied our hands.

657
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,514
<i>Soon as this hits</i>
<i>your intestines,</i>

658
00:26:36,556 --> 00:26:38,099
<i>I'll look at it</i>
<i>through an endoscope.</i>

659
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,687
Stewart, I know you don't want
to talk about this, but...

660
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:48,109
people who get shot
often get PTSD.

661
00:26:48,193 --> 00:26:49,944
<i>It's nothing</i>
<i>to be ashamed of.</i>

662
00:26:50,028 --> 00:26:52,864
It's very treatable
with drugs and therapy.

663
00:26:52,947 --> 00:26:55,533
It's not PTSD.

664
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,537
My girlfriend was with me
when I got shot

665
00:26:59,621 --> 00:27:03,082
and she died.

666
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,250
[groans]

667
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:06,044
I'm sorry.

668
00:27:06,085 --> 00:27:07,545
<i>But that's what I mean.</i>

669
00:27:07,587 --> 00:27:09,088
I lost someone myself.

670
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,218
I know it's traumatic.

671
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:18,264
No, what--what--what I'm trying
to say is that...

672
00:27:18,348 --> 00:27:21,643
I was like this
before the shooting.

673
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:22,977
Since I was a kid.

674
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:25,438
<i>Everything was</i>

675
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,025
hard for me.

676
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:31,277
I--I didn't go out
that much.

677
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:35,281
And--and when I did...

678
00:27:35,323 --> 00:27:37,909
I had panic attacks.

679
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:40,453
<i>Like physical pain.</i>

680
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:42,539
No, it was, like, worse.

681
00:27:42,622 --> 00:27:44,457
It was like I was dying.

682
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:47,460
<i>Then I met Angela.</i>

683
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:52,006
She was the only reason

684
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,133
that I ever wanted
to go out.

685
00:27:56,094 --> 00:27:57,971
But then she died.

686
00:27:58,054 --> 00:27:59,764
and...

687
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,018
[groaning]

688
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:14,571
Blood test
will be done soon.

689
00:28:21,995 --> 00:28:23,371
I'm guessing
that's a new technique.

690
00:28:23,454 --> 00:28:25,999
Hey, you remember
that idea that Cameron had

691
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,500
about trying
to torture the patient

692
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:28,585
into admitting himself?

693
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:30,170
Pretty sure
it was your idea.

694
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:31,421
You want me to slow down
the test?

695
00:28:31,504 --> 00:28:34,716
Wow. Everyone's got all these
great ideas today.

696
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,510
So you're thinking
patient won't leave

697
00:28:37,552 --> 00:28:38,720
because leaving causes pain,

698
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:40,138
so we gotta make staying
more painful.

699
00:28:40,221 --> 00:28:41,347
That actually makes sense.

700
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:42,599
You'll increase his pain,

701
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:43,975
but not enough
to make a difference.

702
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:46,186
He's on morphine.
- He's on morphine now.

703
00:28:46,227 --> 00:28:48,021
Pretty soon he'll be
on less-phine.

704
00:28:48,062 --> 00:28:50,023
'cause when you restock,

705
00:28:50,064 --> 00:28:52,692
you'll actually be giving
Cameron IV bags of saline.

706
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:55,028
And why do you think
I'll be doing this?

707
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,571
Same reason you DDI
the surgery.

708
00:28:56,654 --> 00:28:58,031
That was because
it was an emergency.

709
00:28:58,072 --> 00:28:59,449
No.

710
00:28:59,532 --> 00:29:01,534
It was because your marriage
is falling apart.

711
00:29:01,576 --> 00:29:04,162
When you confess adultery,

712
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:07,040
things tend to go bad.

713
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:10,335
When one part of your life
does a <i>Titanic,</i>

714
00:29:10,418 --> 00:29:12,837
you make a life raft
out of whatever's left,

715
00:29:12,921 --> 00:29:15,089
which makes your job
more significant,

716
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:16,466
which is why you did
the surgery,

717
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:17,592
why you pulled
an all-nighter,

718
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:20,345
and why you'll do this.

719
00:29:20,428 --> 00:29:22,764
She's having me sleep
on the Couch.

720
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:25,058
<i>Just for a few nights.</i>

721
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:26,726
I'm not doing this
to save my job.

722
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:28,603
I'm doing this to save
his life.

723
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:30,438
Right.

724
00:29:30,522 --> 00:29:32,815
That's what we'll tell
everyone.

00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:54,105
Bzzz.

733

734
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,651
that it's not my place

735
00:30:58,735 --> 00:31:00,695
you really want to be walking
into right now?

736
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:03,239
Ric Ocasek would kill me
if I--

737
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:04,282
Oh, you mean Cuddy.

738
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:06,284
Yeah, she's a little nuts.

739
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:08,620
But she's beautiful,
smart, funny,

740
00:31:08,703 --> 00:31:10,330
and most important,
she can stand you.

741
00:31:10,413 --> 00:31:13,708
Yeah. I came here to have
you lecture me on Cuddy,

742
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,418
not because there's
a killer mosquito

743
00:31:15,502 --> 00:31:17,545
chasing me around
my apartment.

744
00:31:17,587 --> 00:31:18,963
House,
there is no mosquito.

745
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:20,840
This is all about Cuddy.

746
00:31:20,924 --> 00:31:23,259
Ah, she's <i>bugging</i> me.

747
00:31:23,343 --> 00:31:24,260
Poetic.

748
00:31:24,344 --> 00:31:26,054
Have you seen this bug?

749
00:31:26,095 --> 00:31:27,430
Have you seen this bite?

750
00:31:27,514 --> 00:31:28,932
No. What I've seen

751
00:31:29,015 --> 00:31:30,600
is a suppurating wound
that you've scratched

752
00:31:30,683 --> 00:31:32,644
and mutilated
into a gangrenous state.

753
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:34,479
Delusional parasitosis.

754
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:36,272
I am not imagining things.

755
00:31:36,314 --> 00:31:37,440
House, you're
a drug addict.

756
00:31:37,524 --> 00:31:39,567
You're always
imagining things.

757
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:42,904
<i>You got bitten</i>
<i>the night you kissed her.</i>

758
00:31:42,946 --> 00:31:45,907
Your itching always gets worse
when you think about her.

759
00:31:45,949 --> 00:31:47,408
<i>You need to address this.</i>

760
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,952
She's my boss.

761
00:31:48,993 --> 00:31:50,787
<i>No, you're not afraid</i>
<i>of authority.</i>

762
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,164
You're afraid she actually
is right for you.

763
00:31:53,248 --> 00:31:54,666
You're afraid
to take a chance

764
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:56,668
because it's too big
a chance.

765
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:57,961
If it doesn't work
with her,

766
00:31:58,002 --> 00:31:59,254
then maybe there's
no one out there.

767
00:31:59,337 --> 00:32:02,882
I am not rationalizing.

768
00:32:02,966 --> 00:32:05,635
I'm better off alone.

769
00:32:05,677 --> 00:32:07,220
Also, you seen her ass
recently?

770
00:32:07,303 --> 00:32:08,471
You're not staying here.

771
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:10,265
Oh, come on.
- No.

772
00:32:10,348 --> 00:32:12,642
You can go home.

773
00:32:12,725 --> 00:32:16,604
Or you're going
to Cuddy's,

774
00:32:16,688 --> 00:32:18,314
gonna ring her doorbell,

775
00:32:18,356 --> 00:32:19,858
and you're gonna ask her
out on a date

776
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:22,068
like regular people do.

777
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:24,070
At 3:00 in the morning?

778
00:32:24,154 --> 00:32:25,864
When do regular
people sleep?

779
00:32:25,905 --> 00:32:27,240
Buh-bye.

780
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,539
<i>Is he in enough pain</i>
<i>to come in yet?</i>

781
00:32:34,581 --> 00:32:37,959
No. Antibody tests back?

782
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:39,043
Inconclusive.

783
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:40,086
Then why are you here?

784
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,462
I missed you.

785
00:32:41,546 --> 00:32:43,756
<i>Endoscopy?</i>
- Inconclusive.

786
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,049
Well, then do it again.

787
00:32:47,427 --> 00:32:49,721
<i>I know it sucks,</i>

788
00:32:49,804 --> 00:32:51,890

00:32:59,731 --> 00:33:03,067
Oh. Oh, whoa.
He's out.

795
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:04,444
Anything?

796
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:05,945
No pulse.

797
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:08,072
<i>Start CPR.</i>

[cell phone beeps]
<i>Get the paddles!</i>

800
00:33:11,784 --> 00:33:13,077
Pizza. You like anchovies?

801
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:14,412
<i>I'm calling the lawyer.</i>

802
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,830
<i>Genuine emergency.</i>

804
00:33:17,081 --> 00:33:18,249
He's dying.

805
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,918
Exactly.

806
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:21,836
Hi. Sorry to wake you.

807
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,421
<i>Your introvert</i>
<i>is having a heart attack.</i>

808

If we don't restart
his heart...

809
00:33:24,672 --> 00:33:27,133
He can survive 15 minutes
on oxygen and CPR.

810
00:33:27,217 --> 00:33:28,510
We can get him
to the hospital in five.

811

[paddles charging]
Lawyer says yes.

812
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,681
Continue CPR.

- Clear.

814
00:33:35,517 --> 00:33:36,434
Wait!

815
00:33:39,312 --> 00:33:40,522
I got a pulse.

816
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:42,023
<i>Cancel the ambulance.</i>

817
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:43,608
He's stable enough
to stay here.

<i>(Foreman)</i>
<i>His heart's back to sinus rhythm,</i>

<i>but it's bradycardic.</i>

820
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:54,629
Taub's putting in
a temporary pacemaker.

821
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:56,047
It'll keep his heart
beating for now.

00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:01,719
I'm asking 'cause it's
the only way I can fire you.

825
00:34:01,803 --> 00:34:04,264
Sorry. In ER, we like
to actually resuscitate

826
00:34:04,347 --> 00:34:05,640
dying people,

827
00:34:05,723 --> 00:34:06,724
Not just let them
flop around.

828
00:34:06,808 --> 00:34:07,892
Could be Lymphoma.

829
00:34:07,976 --> 00:34:09,394
We'd have seen it
on the abdomen.

830
00:34:09,435 --> 00:34:10,603
It has to be a poison.

831
00:34:10,687 --> 00:34:12,689
Organophosphates.

00:34:15,692 --> 00:34:16,901
There are rose petals
in the front entry.

835
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:18,027
Unless he's eating
a bouquet a day,

836
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:19,112
he couldn't--

837
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:20,155
How clean?
- Very.

838
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:22,198
He probably has
a little OCD.

839
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:30,373
How often do you wash
your tub?

840
00:34:30,456 --> 00:34:31,583
Every couple days.

841
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:34,419
Bleach and ammonia?

842
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,129
Yeah.

843
00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:45,513
You know how kids
play toy soldiers

844
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:46,848
in the bath?

845
00:34:46,931 --> 00:34:48,641
He likes to re-enact
the Battle of Cypress.

846
00:34:48,683 --> 00:34:51,477
Three times a week
with real gas.

847
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,479
Ammonia and bleach
makes chlorine gas.

848
00:34:53,521 --> 00:34:55,023
Highly fat soluble.

849
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:57,025
<i>He lost weight</i>
<i>after the stomach pain.</i>

Explains why his symptoms
kept getting worse.

851
00:34:58,526 --> 00:35:01,863
Put him on parenteral steroids
and sodium bicarbonate.

<i>(Taub)</i>
<i>Even if you're right,</i>

853
00:35:03,364 --> 00:35:05,241
that external pacemaker's
gonna fail eventually.

854
00:35:05,325 --> 00:35:07,327
And I don't have the skills
to put in a permanent one.

855
00:35:07,368 --> 00:35:10,205
Well, maybe the poison hasn't
completely shot his heart.

856
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:12,582
And you won't have
to feel guilty

857
00:35:12,665 --> 00:35:13,666
for the rest of your life.

858
00:35:16,628 --> 00:35:18,338
How am I gonna place
the leads in the exact spot

859
00:35:18,379 --> 00:35:20,173
on the right ventricle
without fluoroscopy?

860
00:35:20,256 --> 00:35:21,799
The force?

861
00:35:21,841 --> 00:35:23,801
Taub put in
the temporary one.

862
00:35:23,843 --> 00:35:26,888
You can do that playing
pin the tail on the donkey.

863
00:35:26,971 --> 00:35:28,431
Permanent pacemakers
need precision.

864
00:35:28,515 --> 00:35:30,683
So we can use
the portable X-ray.

865
00:35:30,767 --> 00:35:32,519
It's not real time.
- Sonogram.

866
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,896
And what happens
when I put him into V-tach

867
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:36,481
because the sonogram
isn't precise enough?

868
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:37,857
He's dying.

869
00:35:37,899 --> 00:35:39,567
Exactly why I don't
want to be the one

870
00:35:39,651 --> 00:35:40,860
to kill him.

871
00:35:40,944 --> 00:35:43,238
Thanks.

872
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:45,865
You knew I'd have
to say no.

873
00:35:45,907 --> 00:35:47,158
But you came anyway.

874
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,077
You just wanted a reason
to be angry at me.

875
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,412
If there's something wrong
between us, then--

876
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:52,705
Forget it.

877
00:35:52,747 --> 00:35:54,624
You know why
we spend nights

878
00:35:54,707 --> 00:35:57,877
at my house?

879
00:35:57,919 --> 00:36:00,171
Because when we spend them
at yours...

880
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,134
I could tell
you didn't want me there.

881
00:36:05,218 --> 00:36:06,886
Why would I keep
inviting you over

882
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,513
if i didn't
want you there?

883
00:36:08,596 --> 00:36:11,015
You always kicked me out
every morning.

884
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,101
<i>You never offered me</i>
<i>a drawer.</i>

885
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:16,354
You never cleared out
your closet for me.

886
00:36:16,437 --> 00:36:18,940
I was just a visitor.

887
00:36:19,023 --> 00:36:22,110
How long have you felt
like this?

888
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:26,281
From the start.

889
00:36:35,373 --> 00:36:37,625
I know it's hard for you
because you lost your husband,

890
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,878
but...

891
00:36:42,172 --> 00:36:44,632
I can't keep chasing you
forever.

892
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:58,479
[cell phone rings]

893
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:03,776
I just tried your house.
Where are you?

894
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:06,946
Clubbing. Good or bad?

895
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:08,156
Bad. Vitals are dropping.

896
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,491
The abdominal pain
keeps getting worse.

897
00:37:09,574 --> 00:37:14,496
Means we were too late
with the treatment.

898
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:16,789
Tell the lawyer
he's off the clock.

899
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:18,500
<i>We're done.</i>
- You're giving up?

900
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:22,378
Call Taub. Tell him to pick up
some morphine.

901
00:37:22,462 --> 00:37:24,339
There's no need
for the patient to be in pain.

902
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,674
He's on morphine.

903
00:37:26,716 --> 00:37:29,093
No. He's on saline.

904
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:30,220
I figured you put him
on saline

905
00:37:30,303 --> 00:37:31,471
so i switched him back
to morphine.

906
00:37:31,513 --> 00:37:33,181
I love you.

907
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:35,683
When you reach puberty,
give me--

908
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:41,814
His abdominal pain.
That was on morphine?

909
00:37:41,898 --> 00:37:43,399
<i>Yes.</i>

910
00:37:48,404 --> 00:37:50,031
<i>Is there something</i>
<i>that causes abdominal pain</i>

911
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:51,825
<i>that doesn't respond</i>
<i>to morphine?</i>

912
00:37:54,244 --> 00:37:57,455
I was right.
He is being poisoned.

913
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:10,050
What's this density
on his hip?

914
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:12,177
Just bone.

915
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,430
Think less boney.

916
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:18,392
[House snaps on
rubber gloves]

917
00:38:18,433 --> 00:38:20,352
You think he's got
lead poisoning?

918
00:38:20,435 --> 00:38:21,645
Explains the constipation,

919
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:23,522
<i>the nerves, seizures.</i>

920
00:38:23,605 --> 00:38:24,940
Hold him down.

921
00:38:28,276 --> 00:38:29,486
You're not gonna feel
a thing...

922
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:33,281
except excruciating pain.

923
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:39,830
[Nozick moaning]

924
00:38:41,873 --> 00:38:42,666
[bullet shard bounces
off bowl]

925
00:38:44,835 --> 00:38:46,670
[groans]

926
00:38:46,753 --> 00:38:48,213
[bullet shard bounces
off bowl]

927
00:38:48,296 --> 00:38:50,298
The mugger
used hollow points.

928
00:38:50,382 --> 00:38:52,175
They exploded
and left fragments.

929
00:38:52,259 --> 00:38:54,011
<i>Your doctors missed a couple</i>

930
00:38:54,094 --> 00:38:55,679
<i>hiding behind your hip bone.</i>

931
00:38:55,762 --> 00:38:57,180
<i>It's no biggie.</i>

932
00:38:57,264 --> 00:39:00,267
<i>Except years later,</i>
<i>they started to dissolve,</i>

933
00:39:00,308 --> 00:39:03,437
and then, biggie,
<i>you</i> started to dissolve.

934
00:39:03,478 --> 00:39:05,355
<i>(Cameron)</i>
<i>I'll start him on chelation.</i>

935
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:07,190
The agoraphobia,
could it--

936
00:39:07,274 --> 00:39:09,901
No. Lead wouldn't have started
to disintegrate

937
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:11,486
till years after.

938
00:39:11,528 --> 00:39:12,821
But it could have
exacerbated the fear.

939
00:39:12,904 --> 00:39:14,489
(Nozick)
I don't need to change.

940
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:15,907
<i>(Cameron)</i>
<i>I know you think that.</i>

941
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:17,576
But your life
could be better.

942
00:39:17,659 --> 00:39:18,827
You--you--you'd
have choices.

943
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:20,203
He's lying.

944
00:39:20,238 --> 00:39:21,538
About what?

945
00:39:22,748 --> 00:39:23,832
About everything.

946
00:39:23,915 --> 00:39:25,584
<i>About his life.</i>

947
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:26,835
<i>He doesn't even think</i>

948
00:39:26,918 --> 00:39:28,170
he's happy here.

949
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:29,338
<i>He's miserable.</i>

950
00:39:29,421 --> 00:39:30,589
I've got everything
I need.

951
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:31,840
<i>Yeah?</i>

952
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:34,217
Well, then why did Taub
find rose petals

953
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,677
in your entry hallway?

954
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:37,804
<i>Struck me</i>
<i>as a little weird.</i>

955
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:39,514
<i>Thought it might be</i>
<i>medically relevant.</i>

956
00:39:39,556 --> 00:39:41,892
But it actually just told me
that you were pathetic.

957
00:39:41,975 --> 00:39:45,395
The day you crashed
in your entryway...

958
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:47,898
was your girlfriend's
birthday.

959
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:50,359
<i>You weren't there</i>
<i>for the mail.</i>

960
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,820
You were trying to go
lay flowers on her grave.

961
00:39:56,198 --> 00:39:57,991
<i>Yeah, he's got PTSD.</i>

962
00:39:58,075 --> 00:40:00,077
<i>Yeah, he's agoraphobic.</i>

963
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:01,745
He's also a coward.

964
00:40:01,828 --> 00:40:04,456
<i>You want to change</i>
<i>your life, do something.</i>

965
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:07,292
Don't believe your own
rationalizations.

966
00:40:07,376 --> 00:40:10,128
Don't lock yourself up,
pretend you're happy.

967
00:40:23,475 --> 00:40:24,685
Hi.

968
00:40:24,768 --> 00:40:25,769
Hi.

969
00:40:27,562 --> 00:40:30,399
You were right.

970
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,900
About my husband.

971
00:40:31,942 --> 00:40:34,444
It affected me.

972
00:40:34,528 --> 00:40:37,155
It still affects me.

973
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:41,410
If you're saying
you'll never be able to--

974
00:40:41,451 --> 00:40:43,870
I cleaned out
a drawer for you.

975
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:49,007
Like a
big one.

976
00:40:53,922 --> 00:40:56,591
[strumming]

977
00:40:56,633 --> 00:40:58,051
