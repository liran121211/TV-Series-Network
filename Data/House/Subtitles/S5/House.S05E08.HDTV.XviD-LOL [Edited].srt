1
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:03,678
We're starting a fund.

2
00:00:03,745 --> 00:00:04,846
Then you don't need me.

3
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:06,647
The man's injured.
He can't work.

4
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:07,548
His fault.

5
00:00:12,187 --> 00:00:14,222
We're family.
We depend on each other.

6
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:15,623
We're not family.

7
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:17,658
We're co-workers.

8
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,827
He's not even
that anymore.

9
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,462
I can't believe
you just said that.

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,007
Can't come between a
man and his beer money.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,766
See the big,
heavy machinery?

12
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:27,902
I'm sorry,
but he should give.

13
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,704
You gave.

14
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:33,708
Go back to work.

15
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:36,744
Paolo <i>is</i> the one who got you
off the night shift.

16
00:00:36,812 --> 00:00:41,315
It's not
like I asked him.

17
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:45,419
Also covered for you
labor day weekend.

18
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:47,054
<i>But hey,</i>

19
00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:48,556
it's America.

20
00:00:48,624 --> 00:00:49,457
If you don't want
to contribu--

21
00:00:51,627 --> 00:00:54,662
If you don't want to cont--

22
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:18,252
Oh, God!

23
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:20,621
Get an ambulance.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,502
Good morning.
Don't wanna hear it.

25
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:10,404
So I take it you
did not ask Cuddy out.

26
00:02:10,472 --> 00:02:12,607
Yeah.
- Yeah "I didn't" or yeah "I did"?

27
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,575
Whichever one means
you almost had me convinced

28
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:15,676
it was a good idea.

29
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:16,944
Oh.

30
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,417
Nothing to say?
- No.

31
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:25,686
No, you don't.
Or no, you don't don't?

32
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:28,956
Whichever one means no.

33
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,324
Is this some kind
of reverse--

34
00:02:30,392 --> 00:02:32,660
No.

35
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:34,095
House?

36
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,341
16-year-old girl
with fluid in her lungs.

37
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,710
No previous trauma, lung,
or cardiac issues.

38
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:51,813
Gram stain was negative.
No bacteria, no pneumonia.

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,481
She's a factory worker.

40
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:54,715
<i>Means she probably</i>
<i>works close</i>

41
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,751
<i>to a lot</i>
<i>of recent immigrants.</i>

42
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,654
Thank God some of those
offshore sweat shop jobs

43
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,155
are coming back
to America.

44
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,890
She's an emancipated minor.

45
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:04,992
In a factory?

46
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,963
Either an Olympic gymnast
who busted her leg,

47
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:11,132
a child star who blew
all her sequel money on drugs,

48
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,768
or she's just
a lying runaway.

49
00:03:13,836 --> 00:03:16,270
Her parents died last year.
No relatives.

50
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:17,939
<i>To avoid foster care,</i>
<i>she got a G.E.D.</i>

51
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:19,707
<i>and got emancipated.</i>

52
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:20,741
Could have picked up a parasite
from a co-worker.

53
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:21,976
She'd be having
G.I. problems.

54
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:23,411
Pregnancy's more likely.

55
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,213
Sparks a fluid overload,
hits the lungs,

56
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,681
causes the
pulmonary edema.

57
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,316
Her history says
she's not sexually active.

58
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:30,585
<i>And our history says</i>
<i>she could be lying.</i>

59
00:03:30,652 --> 00:03:32,787
But not every teenager
is having sex.

60
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:34,689
But every teenager
is stupid.

61
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,491
Teenagers on their own
are stupider.

62
00:03:36,558 --> 00:03:38,893
The girl's holding down a job,
makes her rent.

63
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:41,596
On the one hand,
Kutner's right.

64
00:03:41,663 --> 00:03:43,598
<i>Maybe she's</i>
<i>a sweet young thing,</i>

65
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,566
<i>not a screw-up</i>
<i>lying through her teeth.</i>

66
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:47,034
On the two hand,

67
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,936
a pregnancy test
only takes five minutes,

68
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:50,371
and we no longer
kill rabbits.

69
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,606
So in conclusion,

70
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:53,307
<i>shut up,</i>
<i>do the tests.</i>

71
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,876
What else?
<i>- Drugs could damage the heart.</i>

72
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,278
Pressure imbalance allows fluid
to build up in the lungs.

73
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:58,279
Tox screen's clean.

74
00:03:58,347 --> 00:04:00,148
For drugs used recently.

75
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:01,782
Not for drugs used
before recently.

76
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,086
16 doesn't automatically mean
a risky lifestyle.

77
00:04:05,154 --> 00:04:06,354
<i> Didn't we just have</i>
<i>this conversation?</i>

78
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:07,955
Kutner trusts her.
Someone else doesn't.

79
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:09,790
<i>So, in conclusion,</i>

80
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,092
shut up.

81
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,394
Check her home and work
for toxins or drugs.

82
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:15,329
Kutner and Foreman,
do an echo.

83
00:04:15,397 --> 00:04:17,498
Find the extent
of the heart damage.

84
00:04:25,107 --> 00:04:27,441
Kutner can do
the echo on his own.

85
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,511
Yes...But he'll be
very lonely.

86
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:36,083
So I have to ask why?

87
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,453
I've been asked to help run
a clinical trial.

88
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:40,822
That okay with you?

89
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,758
Good for your career.

90
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,059
Great for your street cred.

91
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:45,993
What's in it for me?

92
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:47,595
You have four doctors

93
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,430
and never more
than one case.

94
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,566
It means I have time
to work on other things.

95
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,301
And they'll have
more chances to step up.

96
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:54,836
Stand on their own

97
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:57,238
and if there's
an emergency with Annie,

98
00:04:57,306 --> 00:05:00,141
should she wait until
you finish grooming lab rats?

99
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:01,776
If there's a problem
with Sophia

100
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,911
or any other patient,
you know I'll be there.

101
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,446
The patient is
my priority.

102
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:08,182
No.

103
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:15,656
Oh, do you want a reason?

104
00:05:15,724 --> 00:05:17,992
Clinical trials take time.
Your time is my time.

105
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:32,473
I told you,
I don't do drugs.

106
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,308
Still a good idea
to check your heart.

107
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,077
Something else
could have damaged it.

108
00:05:36,145 --> 00:05:38,546
You find it hard
being all on your own?

109
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:40,148
Having to do
everything without--

110
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,516
drugs to ease my pain?

111
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,351
That's not what--
teenager on her own?

112
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:45,553
I wouldn't trust me either.

113
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:47,555
I meant it must be hard.

114
00:05:49,525 --> 00:05:51,726
No one there
to back you up.

115
00:05:51,794 --> 00:05:53,828
I know you're trying
to be nice,

116
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,129
but I'm not into
the whole pity thing.

117
00:05:55,197 --> 00:05:57,231
I was actually doing
the "I get it" thing.

118
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:59,400
I lost my parents
when I was six.

119
00:05:59,468 --> 00:06:01,602
<i>It doesn't go away.</i>

120
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:04,705
But it gets easier.
You learn to deal.

121
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:10,945
I still get nervous when there's
a knock on the door.

122
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:13,648
Always think
it's the State Trooper...

123
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:16,484
with more bad news.

124
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:19,086
You already got the worst news
and survived.

125
00:06:19,154 --> 00:06:24,425
That's sorta the upside.

126
00:06:24,493 --> 00:06:27,328
Your heart's healthy.

127
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:28,729
Isn't that good news?

128
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:31,399
For your heart, yeah.

129
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:33,935
But it also means we still
don't know what's wrong.

130
00:06:36,905 --> 00:06:40,808
Checkbook balanced,
place spotless.

131
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:42,844
Looks like she builds
her own furniture.

132
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:44,912
If you're this grown up at 16,
what happens at 30?

133
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,748
You turn back into a kid.
Like Kutner.

134
00:06:47,816 --> 00:06:50,051
Kutner's not that bad.

135
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,219
He needs everything
to be nice.

136
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,387
He wants to see
the best in everyone.

137
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,822
Kitchen's clear.

138
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,491
Yeah, friendly is
a dangerous thing.

139
00:06:56,558 --> 00:06:58,693
There is such a thing
as too trusting.

140
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,161
<i>Corollary is there is</i>
<i>such a thing</i>

141
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:01,329
<i>as not trusting enough.</i>

142
00:07:01,396 --> 00:07:03,064
Too much, you get hurt.

143
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,800
Not enough, you don't live.

144
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:07,135
So the object in life
is to get hurt

145
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:08,870
just the right amount?

146
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:10,705
Excuse me if I don't go
out of my way

147
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:12,540
to take relationship advice
from you.

148
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:14,242
<i>And trust...</i>

149
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,211
should be earned.

150
00:07:24,253 --> 00:07:26,120
Bong means nothing.
Drugs are irrelevant.

151
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:27,421
Relevant if
she's taking them.

152
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,923
Even if she is:
irrelevant.

153
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,526
Echo showed no heart damage.

154
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:33,294
Would that be the echo
that Foreman chose

155
00:07:33,362 --> 00:07:34,595
not to run with you

156
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:38,199
after I dashed his
new drug discovery dreams?

157
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:40,401
You mad at me because you think
Kutner screwed up the echo?

158
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:41,536
I didn't screw up
the echo.

159
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:43,938
I know.
No structural heart damage.

160
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,507
So if it's not the heart...
- It's the heart.

161
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:49,243
Didn't you just say it's not?

162
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:51,012
Not all heart damage
has to be structural.

163
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,547
Drugs could have caused
intermittent tachycardia.

164
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:55,550
Irregular heartbeat would
account for the pulmonary edema.

165
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:57,451
The edema was acute.
Vasculitis makes more sense.

166
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,786
There's no sign
in her blood work.

167
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,354
And if she had vasculitis,

168
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:01,556
<i>she'd be too weak</i>
<i>to work in a factory.</i>

169
00:08:01,623 --> 00:08:02,757
She builds her own furniture.

170
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:03,858
You think she skips work

171
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:04,992
because she's feeling
a little weak?

172
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,327
She needs steroids.

173
00:08:06,395 --> 00:08:08,963
Steroids could cause
an irregular heartbeat,

174
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,466
making her current one
irregular-er-er.

175
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,134
<i>Foreman.</i>

176
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,136
<i>Start her on beta-blockers.</i>

177
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,171
<i>The rest of you,</i>
<i>do anything</i>

178
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:20,074
that isn't starting her
on beta-blockers.

179
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:25,179
Start her
on the treatment.

180
00:08:25,247 --> 00:08:27,081
Page me if you need me.

181
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,021
Irregular heartbeat causes blood
to back up behind the heart

182
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,356
and into the lungs.

183
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:36,958
The beta-blockers
keep this from happening.

184
00:08:37,025 --> 00:08:38,860
I thought the test showed
my heart was fine.

185
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:41,129
It's tricky.
An arrhythmia can come and go.

186
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:45,766
So you don't believe me
or the test.

187
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:48,436
You guys are more cynical
than I am.

188
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:51,339
We found the bong
in your apartment.

189
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,075
You went into my apartment?

190
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:55,877
Extended drug use
can damage--

191
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:57,111
The bong belongs
to my ex.

192
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:59,046
It's why he's ex.

193
00:08:59,114 --> 00:09:00,615
That doesn't mean
you didn't use it.

194
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:03,217
No.

195
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:05,052
You have no reason
to trust me.

196
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:09,524
You have to do your treatment.

197
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:15,763
The other possibility is
you have vasculitis.

198
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:17,431
The treatment
for that is steroids.

199
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:19,934
If you've been using drugs,
if they've damaged your heart

200
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:21,035
and I start you on steroids,

201
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:25,072
they could kill you.

202
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,208
I haven't used drugs.

203
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:36,417
I'll get the steroids.

204
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,559
Why are you here?

205
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,860
I owe clinic hours.

206
00:09:45,928 --> 00:09:47,195
No, you don't.

207
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:49,864
I'm here because House
doesn't want me to be here.

208
00:09:49,932 --> 00:09:52,266
I'm guessing he said no
to the clinical trials.

209
00:09:52,334 --> 00:09:53,968
He didn't need to say no.

210
00:09:54,036 --> 00:09:55,369
He just wanted
to say no.

211
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:57,705
House did something solely
out of self-interest?

212
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,273
That's freaky.

213
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:01,209
Don't suppose
you'd want to override?

214
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:03,444
No.

215
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:04,946
What do you think
this is gonna prove?

216
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:06,180
Does it matter?

217
00:10:06,248 --> 00:10:08,449
Just figured you could use
some help down here.

218
00:10:08,517 --> 00:10:11,219
And you spending two hours
wiping noses will annoy House.

219
00:10:11,286 --> 00:10:13,421
If that is your dream,
God bless.

220
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,256
If you want to prove
you can do his job

221
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,892
And something more...

222
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,168
his puke is red.
That's blood, right?

223
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:31,706
That hurt?

224
00:10:31,773 --> 00:10:33,674
What about that?

225
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:36,711
Four days he's been like this.
It's just getting worse.

226
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:38,212
Maybe he just needs to poop.

227
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,814
Evan!
<i>- What?</i>

228
00:10:39,882 --> 00:10:42,083
Worked last time
I had a stomach ache.

229
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:43,684
It's actually
a smart idea.

230
00:10:43,752 --> 00:10:45,419
Which is why that's
the first thing

231
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:46,387
the other doctors checked.

232
00:10:46,455 --> 00:10:47,955
His insides are clear.

233
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,557
Anyone else sick
in daycare?

234
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,125
No.

235
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,693
How 'bout his friends?
- No. No one.

236
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:53,628
What's happening
to him?

237
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:54,962
Not sure yet.

238
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,932
Don't worry.
I've got an idea.

239
00:11:01,336 --> 00:11:02,904
You can make him better, right?

240
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:05,106
That's my plan.

241
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:07,074
You need to make him better.

242
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:14,816
Stay the hell away
from me!

243
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,017
<i>Just calm down.</i>

244
00:11:16,084 --> 00:11:17,385
What happened?
- I adjusted her IV,

245
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:18,653
and she went crazy.

246
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,121
<i>Don't touch me!</i>
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

247
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:21,956
Sophia, it's okay.
We're here to help you.

248
00:11:22,024 --> 00:11:24,392
<i> Just stay away from me!</i>
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

249
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:27,028
I said, don't--

250
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:31,365
Get your hands off of me!
Get your hands--

251
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:34,335
Beta-blockers don't cause
psychotic breaks.

252
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,703
She's not on beta-blockers.

253
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:47,558
We started her on
haloperidol. She's stable.

254
00:11:47,626 --> 00:11:49,093
Lab tests showed
the delirium wasn't caused

255
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:50,795
by a metabolic problem.

256
00:11:50,863 --> 00:11:52,297
Means we still don't know what caused it.
<i>- Yeah, we do.</i>

257
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:53,798
Nice job, Foreman.

258
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:55,099
I didn't switch her meds.

259
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:57,302
But your decision
to stick it to the man

260
00:11:57,369 --> 00:11:59,804
clearly inspired Oliver Twist.

261
00:11:59,872 --> 00:12:02,106
I treated her based
on the symptoms she presented.

262
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:04,642
You treated her based on
empathetic orphan syndrome,

263
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,977
and almost killed her
in the process.

264
00:12:06,045 --> 00:12:08,079
She wasn't on steroids
long enough

265
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:10,281
for it to cause the delirium--
it's a new symptom.

266
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:11,916
One that rules out
vasculitis.

267
00:12:11,984 --> 00:12:13,751
And arrhythmia.

268
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:15,453
The psychotic break caused
a surge of adrenaline,

269
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:16,754
but no irregular
heartbeat.

270
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:18,890
Heart's not the problem.
We're both wrong.

271
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,728
So what causes lung issues
and delirium?

272
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:25,730
<i>And is not based</i>
<i>on wishful thinking</i>

273
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:27,098
That she's safe and happy?

274
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:30,301
Prinzmetal Angina.

275
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:37,041
Silent and unhappy is better
than vocal and unhelpful.

276
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:38,843
<i>If you'd run the echo</i>
<i>that you didn't run</i>

277
00:12:38,911 --> 00:12:40,645
<i>before giving her</i>
<i>the beta-blockers</i>

278
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:42,013
That you didn't give her--

279
00:12:42,081 --> 00:12:43,214
if you'd listened
to what Kutner just said,

280
00:12:43,282 --> 00:12:44,749
you'd know it's not
a heart problem.

281
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:46,250
I'm not talking about her heart.
I'm talking about her head.

282
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:48,786
Prinzmetal Angina
doesn't affect--

283
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:50,989
No reason it couldn't cause
an artery in the brain to spasm.

284
00:12:51,056 --> 00:12:53,157
Leads to the delirium
and the pulmonary edema.

285
00:12:57,963 --> 00:13:00,565
Foreman, give her ergonovine
to cause vasospasms,

286
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,834
and run an MRI to see
which artery's dancing.

287
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:04,936
And when I say Foreman,
I mean...Foreman.

288
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:06,638
I want his signature
on the paperwork.

289
00:13:06,705 --> 00:13:07,939
I want videotape.

290
00:13:08,007 --> 00:13:10,274
I want photographs of him
with the patient

291
00:13:10,342 --> 00:13:13,911
and today's newspaper.

292
00:13:13,979 --> 00:13:15,046
Set her up.
When you're ready--

293
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:17,749
House wants you
to do the procedure.

294
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:19,917
When you get everything set up,
page me.

295
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:31,562
That's really a camera?

296
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,997
Pretty cool, huh?

297
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:34,966
This can go places
the other scopes can't.

298
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:36,534
Jonah,

299
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:38,636
I need you to swallow
this pill.

300
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:39,971
Don't wanna.

301
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:41,806
It doesn't hurt. Promise.

302
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:46,110
Jonah, please.

303
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:48,713
To help make you better.

304
00:13:48,781 --> 00:13:50,148
I don't want to be mean,

305
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:52,016
but if you don't do this,
we'll have to make you.

306
00:13:52,084 --> 00:13:54,352
<i>It's a power pill.</i>

307
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,988
It's not just a camera.

308
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:58,389
It makes your muscles grow.

309
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:00,458
<i>Like the vitamins we take.</i>

310
00:14:00,526 --> 00:14:03,494
Except this was made
with a secret formula.

311
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,474
You did great, sweetheart.

312
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:17,942
You're very brave.

313
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,243
<i>Jonah's lucky.</i>

314
00:14:19,311 --> 00:14:20,878
I was pretty cruel
to my little brother

315
00:14:20,946 --> 00:14:22,080
When I was your age.

316
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:24,015
Why?

317
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:26,617
I guess I thought
that's what big brothers did.

318
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:29,187
Obviously, I was wrong.

319
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:31,356
Is he a doctor too?

320
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,256
No.

321
00:14:36,996 --> 00:14:38,763
Does the pill tickle,
sweetie?

322
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:39,964
<i> He can't feel it.</i>

323
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:40,999
What's funny, your brother?

324
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:48,740
What's happening??

325
00:14:48,807 --> 00:14:50,575
I don't know.

326
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,048
How you guys getting along?

327
00:14:57,116 --> 00:15:00,018
And you suddenly
care why?

328
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:01,419
House was asking questions
last week.

329
00:15:01,487 --> 00:15:02,654
I assume Foreman needs us,

330
00:15:02,721 --> 00:15:03,788
and he's worried
that if we're sniping,

331
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:05,356
we might be distracted.

332
00:15:05,424 --> 00:15:07,558
That's kind of insulting, isn't it?
- Very.

333
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:10,795
You're obviously fine.

334
00:15:10,863 --> 00:15:13,731
I need a differential
for uncontrollable giggling.

335
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:15,967
He's four.
They laugh.

336
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:17,635
Yeah.

337
00:15:17,703 --> 00:15:19,804
Nothing like diarrhea
and bloody vomit

338
00:15:19,872 --> 00:15:21,839
to put you in the mood
to goof around.

339
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:23,574
I've looked down one end
and up the other.

340
00:15:23,642 --> 00:15:25,376
All the tests came back clean.

341
00:15:25,444 --> 00:15:27,211
I can't figure this out.
- <i>You</i> can't?

342
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,246
Don't you work
with three other doctors

343
00:15:28,314 --> 00:15:30,815
and a grouchy gimp?

344
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:33,117
This isn't House's case.

345
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:40,625
Just so you know,
whatever you're trying to prove,

346
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:43,328
it won't be enough.

347
00:15:43,395 --> 00:15:45,530
Gotta go.

348
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:56,507
Sorry.

349
00:15:56,575 --> 00:15:57,508
You didn't miss much.

350
00:15:57,576 --> 00:15:59,043
No spasms yet.

351
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:01,479
<i>Nothing in the anterior</i>
<i>or posterior cerebral arteries.</i>

352
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:02,814
<i>How much longer?</i>

353
00:16:02,881 --> 00:16:04,916
Just a few more minutes.

354
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:06,851
Were your foster homes
all around here,

355
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,086
<i>or did you have</i>
<i>to change schools?</i>

356
00:16:08,153 --> 00:16:09,687
Is chatting about
lousy foster parents

357
00:16:09,755 --> 00:16:10,955
Supposed to relax me?

358
00:16:11,023 --> 00:16:13,758
Left middle cerebral artery
looks good.

359
00:16:13,826 --> 00:16:15,426
My foster parents were great.

360
00:16:15,494 --> 00:16:17,095
I think most
foster parents do it

361
00:16:17,162 --> 00:16:18,496
because they want to do
something decent.

362
00:16:18,564 --> 00:16:21,199
which is why you didn't
get emancipated.

363
00:16:21,266 --> 00:16:23,334
Nothing around
the vertebral artery.

364
00:16:23,402 --> 00:16:24,702
No sign of spasms.

365
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,404
But that's odd.

366
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:30,241
How'd you find out
about your parents?

367
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:32,877
I told you.
State Trooper.

368
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:34,545
Look at that.

369
00:16:34,613 --> 00:16:36,547
Arteries are fine.
You can stop.

370
00:16:36,615 --> 00:16:38,616
Not that.

371
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:40,885
I forget,
did he come to your house

372
00:16:40,953 --> 00:16:43,154
or call you down
to the station?

373
00:16:43,222 --> 00:16:44,422
<i>Came to my house.</i>

374
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,957
I cried into the guy's shirt
for an hour.

375
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:49,060
Wow.

376
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:53,731
FMRIs tell us
where the blood flow is.

377
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,400
You were using
your limbic region.

378
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:56,968
It lights up
when we use our imagination.

379
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:58,803
It doesn't light up
when we're telling the truth.

380
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:02,140
Your parents aren't dead,
are they?

381
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:07,145
I risked my job, put you
on a different treatment--

382
00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:08,980
I didn't lie about the drugs.
- Then why lie about your parents?

383
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:10,048
Because I <i>wish</i>
they were dead.

384
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,287
I got emancipated
because my dad raped me.

385
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:19,891
And my mom pretended
it didn't happen.

386
00:17:29,244 --> 00:17:30,977
<i> No signs of spasm,</i>
<i>impeded blood flow,</i>

387
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:32,179
<i>or brain dysfunction.</i>

388
00:17:32,346 --> 00:17:33,713
<i>It's not Prinzmetals.</i>

389
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:34,648
<i>All the FMRI showed is</i>
<i>House was right.</i>

390
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:37,884
She was lying.

391
00:17:37,951 --> 00:17:40,753
Only relevant if it can cause
pulmonary edema and delirium.

392
00:17:40,821 --> 00:17:42,588
We find out
our patient's been raped,

393
00:17:42,656 --> 00:17:43,723
and that's your response?

394
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,391
Is she a psych patient?

395
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:47,660
Rape could mean STD.

396
00:17:47,728 --> 00:17:50,463
Thank goodness one of you
doesn't have a heart.

397
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:53,533
Maybe if we all stopped
wringing our hands,

398
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,834
we could solve this thing

399
00:17:54,902 --> 00:17:56,936
and let her live to have
a few more nightmares.

400
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:58,871
Gonococcal endocarditis
would explain

401
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:00,306
the pulmonary edema,
the delirium.

402
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:03,710
No sign in her bloodwork.

403
00:18:03,777 --> 00:18:06,379
Could be lying about the rape.

404
00:18:06,447 --> 00:18:09,816
Yesterday,
you were all BFF.

405
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:11,317
Now you think
she's pathological.

406
00:18:11,385 --> 00:18:13,119
Yesterday I had no reason
to doubt her.

407
00:18:13,187 --> 00:18:15,088
If she'd been honest with us
from the beginning--

408
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:16,823
She lied about dead parents

409
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,191
<i>because it's better</i>
<i>than rapist parents.</i>

410
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:19,559
You find that unsympathetic?

411
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:20,460
<i>That's it.</i>

412
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:21,527
What's it?

413
00:18:21,595 --> 00:18:22,962
Her whole life's a mess.

414
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,597
What rhymes with mess?

415
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:29,469
It's not stress. She has none
of the usual manifestations.

416
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:31,571
No hormone imbalance,
no cardiac--

417
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:32,739
Yeah, she's drowning
in her own lungs,

418
00:18:32,806 --> 00:18:33,973
and she's delirious.

419
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,208
She's a picture
of emotional health.

420
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:37,343
<i>Severe emotional stress</i>

421
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:38,444
can lead to asymmetric function
of the midbrain.

422
00:18:38,512 --> 00:18:39,746
Explains the delirium.

423
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:41,648
<i>Interruption </i>
<i>of the brain-heart coupling</i>

424
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:44,350
could cause pulmonary edema.

425
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:46,185
Even if House is wrong,
the treatment's basically

426
00:18:46,253 --> 00:18:47,286
anti-anxiety meds.

427
00:18:47,354 --> 00:18:48,588
Hard to argue with.

428
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:52,425
Yes. I agree.
It does explain everything.

429
00:18:52,493 --> 00:18:54,794
Thirteen, load her up
on diazepam.

430
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:56,596
Foreman, make sure she does it.

431
00:18:56,664 --> 00:19:00,166
Thirteen, make sure
he makes sure.

432
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:07,740
I went to Cuddy's house.

433
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:10,443
But I didn't go in.

434
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:12,545
Went home without ringing either

435
00:19:12,613 --> 00:19:15,448
her metaphorical or actual bell.

436
00:19:15,516 --> 00:19:18,151
Huh.

437
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:20,186
You're processing.

438
00:19:20,254 --> 00:19:21,988
I'm scrubbing.

439
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:23,823
"Huh" means processing.

440
00:19:23,891 --> 00:19:26,459
"Huh" means acknowledging.

441
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:29,195
If you prefer, I could say
"ha," or "hmm," or--

442
00:19:29,263 --> 00:19:33,533
No insights?
No opinions?

443
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,202
You're disappointed.
<i>- You made the decision.</i>

444
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,171
I can't tell you
what's right for you.

445
00:19:38,238 --> 00:19:40,773
Seriously?
'Cause last week you could.

446
00:19:40,841 --> 00:19:42,442
<i>Last year you could.</i>

447
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:44,277
Seems to come
pretty easy to you.

448
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:46,980
Do you want me to tell you
what you should do?

449
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:49,549
I want you to stop thinking
that acting inscrutable

450
00:19:49,616 --> 00:19:53,386
makes you anything
other than annoying.

451
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:59,492
Interesting.

452
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,062
Holding things in
can give you cancer!

453
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,566
Kid's in daycare.
Could be meningitis.

454
00:20:06,634 --> 00:20:08,301
No fever,
no stiffness, no rash.

455
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:09,669
You check his thyroid?

456
00:20:09,737 --> 00:20:11,671
TSH and 3 T4
were within range.

457
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:12,939
Ruled out all
the usual suspects.

458
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:14,307
Nothing's usual
for a four-year-old,

459
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,542
and as fun as this is,
it feels like we're your goomah.

460
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,944
Your feelings are hurt?

461
00:20:18,012 --> 00:20:20,013
Either you can handle
both these cases or you can't.

462
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,881
If you can't,
it's dangerous and stupid.

463
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:22,949
On the other hand,

464
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:24,884
stomach cancer.
Leiomyosarcoma.

465
00:20:24,952 --> 00:20:26,386
Long shot.

466
00:20:26,453 --> 00:20:28,755
Altered mental status means
porphyria's more likely.

467
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:30,289
No abdominal pain?

468
00:20:30,357 --> 00:20:31,791
<i>Cancer explains</i>
<i>the lethargy,</i>

469
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:32,825
The GI symptoms-

470
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:34,494
neither's perfect.

471
00:20:34,561 --> 00:20:36,029
Then we test for both.

472
00:20:36,096 --> 00:20:39,198
And by "we," you mean
the collective "not you."

473
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:42,235
Thanks.

474
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:47,040
Severe stress scrambles
the way the brain

475
00:20:47,107 --> 00:20:48,374
communicates with the rest
of the body.

476
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:50,043
I have a problem
with my brain?

477
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,277
Not exactly.

478
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:53,012
The problem would be
with your body chemistry.

479
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,114
Where's Dr. Kutner?

480
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:57,283
There's four of us.
It's my turn.

481
00:20:59,987 --> 00:21:02,422
I'm sorry I lied
about my parents.

482
00:21:02,489 --> 00:21:05,124
You did what you thought
you had to do

483
00:21:05,192 --> 00:21:08,261
<i>to protect yourself.</i>

484
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:09,329
If we're right,
we should see

485
00:21:09,396 --> 00:21:10,730
a change in your lungs
pretty fast.

486
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,866
<i>Then we can figure out</i>
<i>how to manage your stress.</i>

487
00:21:13,934 --> 00:21:15,034
<i>It might help to turn him in.</i>

488
00:21:15,102 --> 00:21:17,537
File a police report,
get closure.

489
00:21:17,604 --> 00:21:19,505
Won't help.

490
00:21:19,573 --> 00:21:22,308
Not addressing what happened
won't make it go away.

491
00:21:22,376 --> 00:21:24,544
Yeah?

492
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:27,180
What do I have to do
to make it go away?

493
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:29,849
I didn't mean that.
I just mean that you--

494
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:33,152
I addressed it.
I got away from him.

495
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,154
<i>Reporting it</i>
<i>just labels me.</i>

496
00:21:35,222 --> 00:21:37,657
<i>"Girl raped by dad."</i>

497
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:38,658
<i> It doesn't</i>
<i>have to define you.</i>

498
00:21:38,726 --> 00:21:40,626
<i>It's how you see me.</i>

499
00:21:40,694 --> 00:21:44,197
That's why you're treating me
with tranquilizers.

500
00:21:44,264 --> 00:21:46,899
<i>Not anymore.</i>

501
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:52,639
Stress wouldn't change
your urine color.

502
00:22:00,174 --> 00:22:01,274
Labs show the brown urine

503
00:22:01,342 --> 00:22:03,176
was caused by shredded red cells.

504
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:06,213
So what messes with her lungs,
her mental status,

505
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,949
and runs her blood
through a wood chipper?

506
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:10,517
Factory lunch rooms
aren't the cleanest places.

507
00:22:10,585 --> 00:22:12,185
Coulda picked up e. Coli.

508
00:22:12,253 --> 00:22:13,587
Or Shigella
from the restroom.

509
00:22:13,655 --> 00:22:15,622
Either would account
for the red cells, the delirium.

510
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,090
But not the original
lung symptoms.

511
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:18,725
Legionnaire's could,
and cause delirium.

512
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:19,826
No, her sodium's normal.

513
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:24,665
What does her furniture
look like?

514
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:28,769
Said it was homemade.
Old boxes, what?

515
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:31,305
It was wood
nailed together.

516
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:33,607
The wood have
little dents or holes?

517
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:34,908
I didn't see any
in the bookshelves,

518
00:22:34,976 --> 00:22:36,076
But they were painted.

519
00:22:36,144 --> 00:22:37,311
<i>The desk did.</i>

520
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:39,546
Looked like she had stapled
stuff all over it.

521
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:43,417
<i> Holes means that it</i>
<i>was pressure-treated.</i>

522
00:22:43,484 --> 00:22:45,319
Sawing or burning it releases
arsenic into the air.

523
00:22:45,386 --> 00:22:46,420
Into her lungs.

524
00:22:46,487 --> 00:22:49,022
Tests didn't show--

525
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,757
because it found a cloak
of invisibility hiding--

526
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:52,059
Arsenic gets absorbed
in the internal organs

527
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:52,926
so it doesn't show up
in the blood tests.

528
00:22:52,994 --> 00:22:54,461
<i>Test her hair.</i>

529
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:59,766
If it's positive,
chelate it out of her blood.

530
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,307
No cancer, no porphyria.

531
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,776
You paged me
with negative test results?

532
00:23:09,844 --> 00:23:12,079
Yes, because it means
we're done.

533
00:23:12,146 --> 00:23:13,213
Since we still don't know
what's wrong,

534
00:23:13,281 --> 00:23:15,415
this kid has
a real problem.

535
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:16,416
Talk to House?

536
00:23:16,484 --> 00:23:21,822
Not his case.

537
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:24,391
There's a point when Cameron
and I aren't enough.

538
00:23:24,459 --> 00:23:28,428
We're not there.

539
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:32,466
We need to run
some more tests.

540
00:23:32,533 --> 00:23:35,102
A week ago, he was
a happy little boy

541
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:36,503
playing with his brother,

542
00:23:36,571 --> 00:23:38,505
and now he can barely lift
his head.

543
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:41,041
We'll figure this out. I just need--
<i> Mom!</i>

544
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:43,076
Help!

545
00:23:43,144 --> 00:23:46,079
We need a crash cart!

546
00:23:46,147 --> 00:23:47,214
What's going on?

547
00:23:47,281 --> 00:23:48,348
He's in cardiac arrest.

548
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:52,319
Get them outta here.

549
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,926
Clear.

550
00:24:01,663 --> 00:24:02,562
Nothing. Go again.

551
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,597
Clear.

552
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:07,768
He's back.

553
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:11,171
<i>Foreman.</i>

554
00:24:11,239 --> 00:24:13,840
We're there.

555
00:24:22,517 --> 00:24:24,551
Chelation's complete.

556
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:26,386
You're arsenic-free.

557
00:24:26,454 --> 00:24:27,621
So I can get outta here?

558
00:24:27,689 --> 00:24:30,891
In the morning.

559
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:33,660
That's it?

560
00:24:33,728 --> 00:24:35,395
No advice?

561
00:24:35,463 --> 00:24:38,498
<i>No "be careful</i>
<i>out there, kiddo?"</i>

562
00:24:38,566 --> 00:24:39,833
You want my advice?

563
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:43,603
Want is one thing,
expect's another.

564
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:49,810
I wish I could tell you
what to do.

565
00:24:49,877 --> 00:24:52,279
But you're strong.
You've make good choices.

566
00:24:52,347 --> 00:24:54,815
You'll be fine.

567
00:24:54,882 --> 00:25:00,153
Thanks.

568
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:13,266
Need four milligrams lorazepam!

569
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:23,686
<i> After the seizure,</i>
<i>we ran a new MRI.</i>

570
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:25,555
This is Sophia's brain
three days ago,

571
00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:29,991
this is her brain today.

572
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,261
<i>Lesions.</i>

573
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:37,165
Magical lesions,
which appear out of nowhere.

574
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:39,834
She was cured,
then she wasn't.

575
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:41,670
Lesions grew
too fast for cancer.

576
00:25:41,737 --> 00:25:43,104
Could be infection. MRSA.

577
00:25:43,172 --> 00:25:44,039
WBC count would be
through the roof.

578
00:25:44,106 --> 00:25:46,942
Put the arsenic back.

579
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:48,443
<i>You wanna treat a patient</i>

580
00:25:48,511 --> 00:25:50,578
nearly poisoned to death
by giving her more poison?

581
00:25:50,646 --> 00:25:52,747
Just because we call
something a poison

582
00:25:52,815 --> 00:25:54,049
doesn't mean
it's bad for you.

583
00:25:54,116 --> 00:25:55,850
It was killing her.

584
00:25:55,918 --> 00:25:57,152
But since she's still dying,

585
00:25:57,219 --> 00:25:58,320
the arsenic obviously
wasn't killing her.

586
00:25:58,387 --> 00:25:59,688
And since she's
now getting worse,

587
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:01,723
the arsenic was obviously
fighting the killer.

588
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:04,793
It's a hero.

589
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,895
We should be organizing
a parade.

590
00:26:06,963 --> 00:26:09,831
so what does arsenic treat?

591
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:11,166
Syphis.

592
00:26:11,233 --> 00:26:12,867
<i>Before penicillin,</i>
<i>the treatment was arsenic.</i>

593
00:26:12,935 --> 00:26:15,670
We already ruled out STDs,
and even if we were wrong,

594
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:17,272
that much arsenic
in her system

595
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,873
would've wiped out
the syphilis.

596
00:26:18,941 --> 00:26:21,543
Acute promyelocytic leukemia's
still treated with arsenic.

597
00:26:21,611 --> 00:26:23,812
APL explains the lesions
and why they appeared

598
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:26,881
after we took the arsenic out.

599
00:26:26,949 --> 00:26:28,383
So, put the arsenic back.

600
00:26:28,451 --> 00:26:30,185
We still have
a problem.

601
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:31,720
Arsenic slows leukemia,
but it can't cure it.

602
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:33,221
<i>If she wants to see 17,</i>

603
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:34,589
<i>she's gonna need</i>
<i>a bone marrow transplant.</i>

604
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:37,592
Best match would be
a sibling or a parent.

605
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,262
Biopsy a lesion,
confirm that she's dying,

606
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:43,565
then load her up
with arsenic.

607
00:26:43,633 --> 00:26:46,101
Keep her alive till you can
convince her that rapist marrow

608
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:48,670
and rapist-enabling marrow
work just as well

609
00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:53,541
as the unleaded stuff.

610
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:55,410
We need to talk.

611
00:26:55,478 --> 00:26:58,146
This about the case you
didn't want me to know about?

612
00:26:58,214 --> 00:26:59,481
Cuddy?

613
00:26:59,548 --> 00:27:02,350
Foreman.

614
00:27:02,418 --> 00:27:03,785
You didn't flinch
when you found out

615
00:27:03,853 --> 00:27:05,553
about a sixteen-year-old
who could be dying

616
00:27:05,621 --> 00:27:07,088
in the next few days.

617
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:10,425
Means you're here about someone
even younger dying even faster.

618
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:11,559
He needs you.

619
00:27:11,627 --> 00:27:14,496
But he has you.

620
00:27:19,368 --> 00:27:20,835
This boy is going to die.

621
00:27:20,903 --> 00:27:22,737
You selfish enough
to let it happen?

622
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:24,139
Pot calling
a kettle a pot?

623
00:27:24,206 --> 00:27:25,607
You're a hypocrite.

624
00:27:25,675 --> 00:27:27,575
If our job is to find out
what's killing patients,

625
00:27:27,643 --> 00:27:28,843
you'd help this kid.

626
00:27:28,911 --> 00:27:30,245
But you'd rather play
mind games

627
00:27:30,313 --> 00:27:32,547
to prove you're the only one
with magical powers.

628
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:34,416
Wanted something all your own?
Now you got it.

629
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:38,320
Your disengagement won't work.

630
00:27:38,387 --> 00:27:39,621
I can see that.

631
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:40,922
You think that when you tell me
what I should do,

632
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:42,691
my instincts are
to push back,

633
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:44,292
so that by not telling me
what you think I should do,

634
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,161
I'll do what you think
I should do.

635
00:27:46,228 --> 00:27:47,529
I sound convoluted.

636
00:27:47,597 --> 00:27:49,864
Disengagement is neither
artful nor effective.

637
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:54,102
So my not doing anything isn't
causing you to do anything?

638
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,670
Right.

639
00:27:55,738 --> 00:27:56,905
I'm okay with that.

640
00:27:56,973 --> 00:27:59,074
No, you're not.

641
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:01,042
You are designed
to have opinions

642
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,377
and to force them on people.

643
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:05,513
I'm starting
to sound desperate.

644
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:08,416
Don't screw
with my stuff.

645
00:28:13,522 --> 00:28:15,490
I just need a donor
with the same blood type

646
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:16,758
or something, right?

647
00:28:16,826 --> 00:28:19,127
Actually, bone marrow's
a little more complex.

648
00:28:19,195 --> 00:28:22,264
The best donors
are immediate family.

649
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:26,101
But those donor banks
have thousands of names.

650
00:28:26,168 --> 00:28:29,371
Your parents' similar DNA
gives you a much better Chan--

651
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:31,039
No.

652
00:28:31,107 --> 00:28:34,276
<i>If I do this,</i>

653
00:28:34,343 --> 00:28:38,680
I'll owe my life to them.

654
00:28:38,748 --> 00:28:41,816
It'd mean everything else that
had happened was somehow okay.

655
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:44,986
<i>They don't deserve that.</i>

656
00:28:45,054 --> 00:28:48,556
They're not in my life.

657
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:52,060
If that means I'm dead,
then I'm dead.

658
00:28:54,864 --> 00:28:59,834
I have Huntington's Disease.

659
00:28:59,902 --> 00:29:03,672
I'm dying.

660
00:29:03,739 --> 00:29:05,006
I don't know when it'll happen,

661
00:29:05,074 --> 00:29:06,775
but it'll be sooner
than I ever planned.

662
00:29:06,842 --> 00:29:10,445
<i>And I'd do anything</i>
<i>to stop it.</i>

663
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:12,414
<i>Because the only way</i>
<i>to make anything right,</i>

664
00:29:12,481 --> 00:29:15,517
the only way
to make your life matter

665
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:18,954
<i>is to live as long</i>
<i>and as well</i>

666
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:20,855
as you possibly can.

667
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:27,829
Have you ever been raped?

668
00:29:30,866 --> 00:29:32,968
No.

669
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:35,036
Don't try to walk
in my shoes

670
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,572
and I won't try
to walk in yours.

671
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:46,114
You had no right.

672
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:47,415
To try to convince her
to do the right thing?

673
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:49,117
To lie to her.
- It's a true story.

674
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:50,318
Who cares
if it's not my story?

675
00:29:50,386 --> 00:29:52,053
It's my life.
- It's her life.

676
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:53,154
Point wasn't I'm dying.

677
00:29:53,222 --> 00:29:54,489
Point was she should live.

678
00:29:54,557 --> 00:29:56,091
You should have told her.

679
00:29:56,158 --> 00:29:57,559
Instead you tell her
to call the cops,

680
00:29:57,627 --> 00:29:58,827
give her stats
on DNA markers.

681
00:29:58,894 --> 00:29:59,928
Everything's by the book.

682
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:02,197
Nothing's ever personal.

683
00:30:02,265 --> 00:30:03,865
Trying to sleep here!

684
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:05,834
Biopsy confirmed APL.

685
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:07,469
She needs
a bone marrow transplant.

686
00:30:07,536 --> 00:30:09,471
Run the donor banks.

687
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:11,239
I'm going home.

688
00:30:11,307 --> 00:30:13,942
We need to track down
her parents.

689
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:17,712
I assume she's already said no
to that idea,

690
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,115
or there'd be no need
to screw up your courage

691
00:30:20,182 --> 00:30:21,917
before saying it.

692
00:30:21,984 --> 00:30:24,152
Children who've been through
trauma can't think clearly.

693
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,021
Children who've been through
trauma and are dying--

694
00:30:26,088 --> 00:30:28,323
guess I'm the only one
who cares about patient rights.

695
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:29,824
What she wants
could kill her.

696
00:30:29,892 --> 00:30:31,393
What she needs
could save her.

697
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,795
Our job is to find out
what's killing patients,

698
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:35,563
not treat them
for chronic idiocy.

699
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:36,998
Idiocy is what's killing her.

700
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:39,000
And since we can't cure that,
I'm going home.

701
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:40,368
We could save
this patient,

702
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:42,003
but all you care about
is getting your answer.

703
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:46,574
Your point being?

704
00:30:46,642 --> 00:30:49,177
Taub and Kutner can check
the donor banks.

705
00:30:49,245 --> 00:30:50,578
I'm gonna find
her parents.

706
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,384
Can't see
why you're surprised.

707
00:30:56,452 --> 00:30:58,086
You push against House,
he's gonna push back.

708
00:30:58,154 --> 00:30:59,321
Against me, I get.

709
00:30:59,388 --> 00:31:00,822
His ego's killing
my patient.

710
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,291
You liked this case because
he wasn't looming over you.

711
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:05,393
The decisions were yours.

712
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:07,162
Only difference now is
he decided not to loom.

713
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:09,831
Doesn't change the fact
that your patient's dying.

714
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:12,300
What are we missing?
What's not in the file?

715
00:31:12,368 --> 00:31:15,003
The mother, overburdened
at the end of her rope.

716
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:16,938
<i>Makes her kid sick</i>

717
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:18,340
so someone else
will take care of him.

718
00:31:18,407 --> 00:31:19,407
Sympathize with her.

719
00:31:19,475 --> 00:31:20,976
Munchauseny proxy?

720
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:22,444
She brought him
into the clinic,

721
00:31:22,511 --> 00:31:24,245
was with him when he went
into cardiac arrest.

722
00:31:24,313 --> 00:31:25,280
<i>The brother</i>
<i>would have noticed,</i>

723
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:26,581
said something.

724
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:28,650
Evan's even more protective
than she is.

725
00:31:28,718 --> 00:31:30,018
Then maybe
it's the brother.

726
00:31:30,086 --> 00:31:31,586
He's eight.

727
00:31:31,654 --> 00:31:32,754
Could be jealous.

728
00:31:32,822 --> 00:31:35,123
He's the opposite
of jealous.

729
00:31:35,191 --> 00:31:37,058
He includes Jonah
in everything he does.

730
00:31:37,126 --> 00:31:40,362
Makes sure he eats,
brushes his teeth.

731
00:31:44,533 --> 00:31:46,801
I think we gave him
an idea.

732
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:51,206
Either that or he's off
to kill House.

733
00:31:57,747 --> 00:31:58,880
Mr. Velez?

734
00:31:58,948 --> 00:32:00,282
Yeah?

735
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:03,251
I'm Dr. Remy Hadley from
Princeton-Plainsboro Hospital.

736
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:06,821
We're treating your
daughter Sophia for leukemia

737
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:08,623
and we need to test
both you and your wife

738
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:10,292
for bone marrow donation.

739
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:13,194
I'm sorry, you said you
were from Princeton-Plainsboro?

740
00:32:13,262 --> 00:32:15,931
I know this is unexpected,
but time is short and--

741
00:32:15,998 --> 00:32:18,733
What's going on?

742
00:32:18,801 --> 00:32:20,502
This doctor says
you have leukemia.

743
00:32:22,171 --> 00:32:23,638
I don't have leukemia.

744
00:32:23,706 --> 00:32:25,640
Sophia Velez?

745
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:26,875
Yeah?

746
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:31,179
Sophia Isabel Velez?

747
00:32:31,247 --> 00:32:33,315
Yeah.

748
00:32:33,382 --> 00:32:35,150
Do you know
something I don't?

749
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,455
Just that liars lie.

750
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,757
You stole her identity.

751
00:32:47,824 --> 00:32:50,226
To protect myself.

752
00:32:50,293 --> 00:32:51,594
<i>So they can't find me.</i>

753
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:53,162
We can protect you.

754
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,363
But we need to find
your parents.

755
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,031
Why?

756
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,666
You have my blood.

757
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,068
You don't need my name
to find a donor.

758
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,469
You're a minor.

759
00:33:00,537 --> 00:33:02,505
You obviously forged
the emancipation papers.

760
00:33:02,572 --> 00:33:04,540
Even if we had a donor,

761
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,909
we'd still need your parents'
consent to treat you.

762
00:33:06,977 --> 00:33:10,913
Can't you just pretend
you didn't go to that house?

763
00:33:10,981 --> 00:33:12,715
That you didn't find
that girl?

764
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:21,190
Calling your parents
doesn't mean a family reunion.

765
00:33:21,258 --> 00:33:24,527
You don't even
have to see them.

766
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:35,237
When I get sick enough,
it'll be an emergency.

767
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:37,673
You'll have
to give me a transplant.

768
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:39,608
Even without consent.

769
00:33:51,288 --> 00:33:52,621
An iron overdose?

770
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:55,257
From his vitamins.

771
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,293
<i>If I'm right,</i>
<i>we can treat him tonight.</i>

772
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,861
<i>He'll be back to his old self</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

773
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:02,498
<i>But...</i>

774
00:34:02,566 --> 00:34:04,400
They're children's vitamins.

775
00:34:04,468 --> 00:34:06,836
I--I only give him one.

776
00:34:06,903 --> 00:34:08,771
I know.

777
00:34:13,543 --> 00:34:15,644
I thought more
would make him strong.

778
00:34:18,448 --> 00:34:22,251
I didn't mean
to make him sick.

779
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:24,653
He's gonna be okay.

780
00:34:29,126 --> 00:34:30,993
He's gonna hate me.

781
00:34:31,061 --> 00:34:34,330
Well, that's the great thing
about brothers.

782
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:38,901
You can make mistakes,
and they'll still love you.

783
00:34:58,622 --> 00:35:00,489
Donor list turned up
a partial match.

784
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,191
So treat her.

785
00:35:02,259 --> 00:35:03,526
It's only a three
out of six.

786
00:35:03,593 --> 00:35:05,127
So don't treat her.

787
00:35:05,195 --> 00:35:06,395
She may not last
the week.

788
00:35:06,463 --> 00:35:08,064
Partial's better
than nothing.

789
00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:10,166
So treat her.
She'll reject it.

790
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,400
And she'll be too weak
to try again

791
00:35:11,468 --> 00:35:13,002
when a better match
turns up.

792
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,336
It's my turn now,
right?

793
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:15,704
If a better match
turns up.

794
00:35:15,772 --> 00:35:18,074
Well, when you decide,
get back to me.

795
00:35:22,712 --> 00:35:25,247
She's scared.

796
00:35:25,315 --> 00:35:27,716
Not scared enough.

797
00:35:27,784 --> 00:35:29,952
Tell her the thing
about emotional reactions

798
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,721
is they're definitionally
irrational.

799
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:34,890
Or stupid.

800
00:35:34,958 --> 00:35:36,826
Might wanna phrase that
in your own words.

801
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:38,060
She wants to deny her parents

802
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:40,496
the satisfaction
of saving her life.

803
00:35:40,564 --> 00:35:43,199
That's your rational explanation
of her emotional response.

804
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,266
That was
her explanation.

805
00:35:47,304 --> 00:35:50,072
That makes sense.

806
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:50,973
How long did it take her
to come up with that?

807
00:35:51,041 --> 00:35:52,641
It was her immediate reaction.

808
00:35:52,709 --> 00:35:54,844
That doesn't make sense.

809
00:35:54,911 --> 00:35:57,747
The fact that it makes sense
doesn't make sense?

810
00:35:57,814 --> 00:35:59,315
Emotional is immediate.

811
00:35:59,382 --> 00:36:01,450
She went to rational first.

812
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:03,786
Means there was
no emotional to process.

813
00:36:03,854 --> 00:36:06,322
You're saying she's lying
about being raped?

814
00:36:06,389 --> 00:36:08,457
Wouldn't be her first.

815
00:36:08,525 --> 00:36:10,392
She lied about one trauma
to cover a worse trauma.

816
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:16,499
So...what's worse than rape?

817
00:36:24,674 --> 00:36:26,041
Hi, I'm Dr. House.

818
00:36:29,513 --> 00:36:31,213
What did you do?

819
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:33,382
I don't--

820
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,651
Something happened,
but it wasn't rape.

821
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:39,422
Believe whatever you want.

822
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,390
You're scared,
and stubborn,

823
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,392
and you don't like people
feeling sorry for you.

824
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,560
Why not?

825
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:46,128
I don't want pity.

826
00:36:46,196 --> 00:36:49,365
I just wanna be normal.

827
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:52,635
But you know you're not.

828
00:36:52,702 --> 00:36:55,337
You need people to see
how independent you are,

829
00:36:55,405 --> 00:36:57,606
how well you're coping.

830
00:36:57,674 --> 00:37:01,444
So they won't see the lost,
hurt little girl.

831
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:06,649
Because that's not
what you see.

832
00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:11,620
You see someone
who did something terrible...

833
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:15,324
who deserves to suffer.

834
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,827
Who doesn't deserve
to live.

835
00:37:22,132 --> 00:37:24,767
What did you do?

836
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:34,376
Eventually,
we'll find your parents...

837
00:37:34,444 --> 00:37:36,112
if only
to deliver the body.

838
00:37:38,648 --> 00:37:40,249
Then they won't care.

839
00:37:40,317 --> 00:37:41,584
You're an idiot.

840
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:45,187
You'd rather die
than face your parents

841
00:37:45,255 --> 00:37:47,723
because, what,
you broke their Faberge Egg?

842
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:49,425
I killed their son.

843
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,666
I killed my brother.

844
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,103
I was supposed
to watch him.

845
00:38:03,173 --> 00:38:07,343
He was in the bath.

846
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:10,646
I could hear him laughing.

847
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:18,387
Every time they look at me,
it's like I kill him again.

848
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:40,076
If you don't take
your parents' bone marrow...

849
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:44,213
you'd be killing
their other child.

850
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,382
If they don't hate you now,
they will then.

851
00:38:49,386 --> 00:38:52,021
I don't care.

852
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:53,956
Sure you do.

853
00:38:57,394 --> 00:39:00,362
You want someone to tell you
it was just an accident.

854
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:03,532
That it's not that bad,
but it is that bad.

855
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,201
And you know it.

856
00:39:05,268 --> 00:39:07,937
There's nothing you can do
to change that.

857
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:17,446
But there is one thing you
can do to not make it worse.

858
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:41,303
# someone #

859
00:39:41,371 --> 00:39:44,206
# reaching for me now #

860
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:54,417
# through #

861
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:59,255
# the dark reaching for me now #

862
00:40:05,762 --> 00:40:09,065
# you need #

863
00:40:09,132 --> 00:40:14,170
# someone to hear you
when you sigh #

864
00:40:21,545 --> 00:40:24,480
# someone #

865
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:29,218
# to wipe away
those tears you cried #

866
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,796
# someone to hold #

867
00:40:40,864 --> 00:40:44,200
# you 'neath the darkened sky #

868
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,542
# someone #

869
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:59,014
# to love you more than I #

870
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,257
If you're here to celebrate

871
00:41:08,325 --> 00:41:10,292
the kid's bone marrow
transplant working,

872
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,027
you missed cake.

873
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,662
I want to do
clinical trials.

874
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:16,365
Already had
this conversation.

875
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,434
I've proved that I can work
two cases at once.

876
00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:20,236
I can do this.

877
00:41:20,303 --> 00:41:21,937
And I'm doing it.

878
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:24,707
Okay.

879
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:26,242
Okay?

880
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:27,743
Just like that?

881
00:41:27,811 --> 00:41:31,247
Can I give
my reasons later...or never?

882
00:41:31,314 --> 00:41:32,882
Three days ago
you said no.

883
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:35,718
Three days ago
you asked me.

884
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:38,254
Now you told me.

885
00:41:38,321 --> 00:41:40,122
Can't say no
if it's not a question.

886
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:11,253
Nice thing you did
for Foreman.

887
00:42:11,321 --> 00:42:14,490
He speaks.

888
00:42:14,558 --> 00:42:19,495
He deflects.

889
00:42:19,563 --> 00:42:22,531
I almost cost
a four-year-old his life.

890
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,301
Well, you knew Foreman
would figure it out.

891
00:42:25,368 --> 00:42:27,937
Did I?

892
00:42:31,141 --> 00:42:33,509
You just needed
to prove it to him.

893
00:42:33,577 --> 00:42:35,010
You're an ass.

894
00:42:35,078 --> 00:42:36,512
But a noble one.

895
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,947
I sound clever.

896
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,049
Thank you.

897
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:41,984
Your little game
didn't work.

898
00:42:42,052 --> 00:42:44,587
I'm not Foreman,
and you're not me.

899
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:52,094
<i>You wanna talk about her?</i>

900
00:42:52,162 --> 00:42:54,997
Nope.

901
00:42:55,065 --> 00:42:58,267
All right.

902
00:42:58,335 --> 00:43:01,070
You're gonna be okay,
House.

903
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,174
Good to know.

904
00:43:05,242 --> 00:43:07,910
