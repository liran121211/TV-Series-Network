1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,972
On your right.
On your right. On your right.

2
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:08,136
Back, back, back, back, back.
Come on, buddy.

3
00:00:11,756 --> 00:00:14,088
Yeah, Dan! Yeah!

4
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:15,890
Yea!
Yea!

5
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:19,299
Back, back, back, back, back.
Watch the winger!

6
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,461
Yeah!

7
00:00:56,925 --> 00:00:58,916
You okay?

8
00:00:58,997 --> 00:01:01,056
Dan? Dan, talk to me.

9
00:01:01,136 --> 00:01:03,832
Dan. Dan.

10
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:06,741
Get a doctor!

11
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,670
- Hey.
- Close the door.

12
00:01:48,744 --> 00:01:51,304
Close the door.

13
00:01:54,056 --> 00:01:57,150
Is Cuddy down the hall
counting to 50?

14
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,063
She knows I'm in here,
in the clinic, as she commanded.

15
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:03,367
- She just doesn't know I'm alone.
- Well, you've got a full waiting room.

16
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:06,174
- How long do you think you can ignore them?
- I'm off at 4:00.

17
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,184
You're doing this
to avoid five minutes of work?

18
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,887
If I go out there, I get assigned
a kid with a runny nose.

19
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,197
That's 30 seconds looking at the nose,
25 minutes talking to a worried mom...

20
00:02:16,273 --> 00:02:19,071
who won't leave until she's sure
it's not meningitis or a tumor.

21
00:02:19,147 --> 00:02:21,513
Yes. Concerned parents
can be so annoying.

22
00:02:21,585 --> 00:02:25,214
Just tell Cuddy you've got an urgent
case. You had to leave early.
That would be lying.

23
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:30,197
And that would be wrong. But luckily
the definition of "urgent" is fungible.

24
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,900
Not the definition
of "case" though.

25
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,083
You have no cases?

26
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,218
You have no cases?

27
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:45,028
You've got handpicked
doctors-- specialists--

28
00:02:45,106 --> 00:02:48,007
working for you,
and they're sitting on their hands?

29
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,913
- Cameron's answering my mail.
- Oh, time well spent, I'm sure.

30
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:53,979
Foreman and Chase?

31
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,051
Research?

32
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:05,476
Nine letters.
Iodine deficiency in children.

33
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:07,714
Cretinism.

34
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:20,013
So, 4:03 p.m.,
Dr. House checks out.

35
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,019
Please write that down.

36
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,285
Dr. House.
Sorry. Done for the day.

37
00:03:24,362 --> 00:03:27,263
Plenty of docs here
to take care of you.
But we had an appointment.

38
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:30,668
Nice try, but this is
a walk-in clinic, which means
there are no appointments.

39
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,973
You walk in, sign the chart,
and a doctor will see you.

40
00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:36,541
Just not me.
Your letter says that we'd see you.

41
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,993
Not a big letter writer.
Here.

42
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,062
When did my signature get so girlie?

43
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:48,340
- I can explain.
- See that "G"?

44
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,851
See how it makes a big loop on top?

45
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:54,290
Doesn't even look like my handwriting.
Think I have something?

46
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:57,765
What's the differential diagnosis
for writing G's like
a junior high school girl?

47
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:01,570
It's impossible to get to you
through normal channels.
They have called, e-mailed.

48
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:05,550
Perseverance does not equal worthiness.
Next time you want to get my attention,
wear something fun.

49
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:07,591
Low-rider jeans are hot.

50
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:12,724
Sixteen-year-old male. Sudden onset
of double vision and night terrors,
with no apparent cause.

51
00:04:12,806 --> 00:04:15,274
The kid's been to
two neurologists, and he--
Night terrors?

52
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:18,143
- As in big scary monsters?
- Yes.

53
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:24,483
- Where are you going?
- To see the family.

54
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:28,627
- You're going to examine a patient?
- Nine times out of 10,
there's no reason to talk to a patient.

55
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:32,543
But night terrors in a 16-year-old
is a very good reason
to talk to this family.

56
00:04:32,618 --> 00:04:34,552
Good work.

57
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,463
Margins are fine.

58
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:41,467
No lesions.

59
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:45,005
Color is good.

60
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,412
How long have you been
having night terrors?
Three weeks.

61
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,685
He's afraid to go to bed.
He's exhausted,
can barely function.

62
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:57,259
- What does that tell you?
- Nothing. It's just fun
watching him blink.

63
00:04:57,341 --> 00:05:00,833
Name as many animals as you can
that begin with the letter "B". Go.

64
00:05:07,597 --> 00:05:11,693
- Baby elephant?
- Baby elephant is actually
a good answer.

65
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:14,299
- "B" is a bear of a letter.
- What does that tell you?

66
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,407
Proves two things:
no neurological damage, and your son
is never gonna be chief fry cook.

67
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:22,220
In teens, there are two
likely causes of night terrors.

68
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:25,995
- Posttraumatic stress. Any recent
shoot-outs at your high school?
- No.

69
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:27,301
- Then, Dave--
- Dan.

70
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:31,437
If there's no trauma,
the other cause is... sexual abuse.

71
00:05:34,158 --> 00:05:37,594
So who's molesting you?
Teacher?

72
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:40,658
Extra-friendly neighbor?
I'd ask if either of you
were involved, but you'd deny it.

73
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,469
We would never hurt Dan.

74
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:44,944
I say it here,
it comes out there.

75
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:47,507
This lack of response
is consistent with abuse.

76
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:50,387
There's no one, okay?
I-- I swear.

77
00:05:50,462 --> 00:05:53,556
There was trauma.
I got hit in the head
during a lacrosse game.

78
00:05:55,407 --> 00:05:58,774
Did you know
that he got hit in the head?

79
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:02,375
- They didn't mention it. No.
- Yeah. Why bother?

80
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:07,821
No, no. We took him
to the E.R. after the game.

81
00:06:07,902 --> 00:06:10,427
He was scanned. They tested him.
They said he was fine.

82
00:06:10,508 --> 00:06:12,442
No concussion.
It's gotta be something else.

83
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:16,005
You hound me for my opinion,
and then you question my diagnosis.

84
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:19,488
Cool. E.R. obviously screwed up.
Kid's got a concussion.

85
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:22,690
I had double vision before I was hit.
Well, that changes everything.

86
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:25,567
You need glasses.
That's why you had double vision,

87
00:06:25,643 --> 00:06:30,342
which is why you got hit,
which is why you have a concussion,
which is why you have night terrors.

88
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,446
You need to see an ophthalmologist,
which I am not.

89
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:38,897
You enjoyed that. I brought a reasonable
case to your attention, and you shoved it
in my face just to humiliate me.

90
00:06:38,973 --> 00:06:41,840
You're an only child, aren't you?
Why would you say that?

91
00:06:41,913 --> 00:06:43,642
Because everything is about you.

92
00:06:44,786 --> 00:06:49,086
This may seem incredibly controversial,
but I think sexual abuse is bad.

93
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:52,155
I just wanted to make sure
he wasn't being diddled
by Daddy-- or Mommy.

94
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:54,262
Anything else is just a bonus.

95
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,532
I'm not an only child.
Interesting.

96
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:10,871
What?
Don't move.

97
00:07:11,648 --> 00:07:15,584
- Did I bore you in there?
- What? Uh, no. Not-- Not really.

98
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:18,023
Are you tired?

99
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:20,155
- Sometimes.
- He never sleeps.
Ofcourse he's tired.

100
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:22,702
- Right now. At this moment.
Are you tired?
- No. No.

101
00:07:22,773 --> 00:07:25,003
That twitch in your leg.
Did you feel that?

102
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:28,612
- Didn't hurt.
- His leg twitched.
I don't see what--

103
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:32,453
It's called a myoclonic jerk.
It's very common
when you're falling asleep.

104
00:07:32,528 --> 00:07:37,898
Respiration rate falls, and the brain
sometimes interprets this as the body dying,
so it sends a pulse to wake it up.

105
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:40,169
- So?
- So, he's not asleep.

106
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:42,976
He's awake.

107
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:45,044
Admit him.

108
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:51,465
I recognize that loopy "G".

109
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,530
So, what does the jerk tell us?

110
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,908
Nothing good.
The brain's losing control of the body.

111
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:59,748
Can't order the eyes to focus,
regulate sleep patterns
or control muscles.

112
00:07:59,825 --> 00:08:01,850
A movement disorder
or a degenerative brain disease.

113
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:05,456
Either way, this kid's gonna be
picking up his diploma
in diapers and a wheelchair.

114
00:08:05,537 --> 00:08:07,505
Maybe not that bad.
Could be an infection.

115
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:09,601
You wish.
No fever, no white count.

116
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,118
Anyone think this differential diagnosis
might be compromised because
we don't have an accurate family history?

117
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:18,457
- I took an accurate family history.
- You didn't even take an accurate family.

118
00:08:19,402 --> 00:08:21,632
- His father's not his father.
- Why would you say that?

119
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:24,768
Thirty percent of all dads
don't realize they're raising
someone else's kid.

120
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:27,976
False paternity's more like 10%.
That's what our moms
would like us to believe.

121
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:30,546
Who cares?
If he got it from his parents,
they'd both be dead.

122
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:33,495
- Can we get on with
the differential diagnosis?
- Fifty bucks says I'm right.

123
00:08:33,568 --> 00:08:36,128
- I'll take your money.
- Hit a nerve?

124
00:08:36,207 --> 00:08:39,665
- Don't worry. I'm sure the guy who
tucked you in was your daddy.
- Make it a hundred.

125
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:43,549
What about leukoencephalopathy
in a 16-year-old?

126
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,922
It doesn't necessarily
have to be that bad.

127
00:08:45,996 --> 00:08:49,022
If we exclude the night terrors,
it could be something systemic.

128
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:51,628
- His liver, kidneys.
Something outside the brain.
- Yes.

129
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,440
- Feel free to exclude any symptom
if it makes your job easier.
- Night terrors were anecdotal.

130
00:08:55,518 --> 00:09:00,251
- He could've had a bad dream.
- No. Parents said he was conscious during
and didn't remember anything afterwards.

131
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,263
- That's a night terror.
- Parents said?

132
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,427
That's a good point.

133
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:07,770
Before we condemn this kid,
maybe we should entertain
Dr. Chase's skepticism.

134
00:09:07,846 --> 00:09:12,909
I want a detailed polysomnograph.
If he's having night terrors,
I want to see them.

135
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,670
I usually don't move
during night terrors.

136
00:09:37,747 --> 00:09:39,681
I'm not restraining you for them.

137
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,790
E.E.G. revealed abnormalities
in your brain--

138
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:48,232
caused nerve damage in your toes.

139
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,048
What are you doing?

140
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:01,222
- Fixing it.
- Can I talk to my parents?

141
00:10:01,302 --> 00:10:03,361
Oh, they know all about this.

142
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:05,964
I'd really like to see them.

143
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:17,900
Please. I'd really like them here.

144
00:10:19,676 --> 00:10:21,667
This is gonna hurt, Dan.

145
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:23,739
Oh. Oh, God.

146
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:43,116
That's a night terror.

147
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:57,450
We did a C. T., M.R.I., C.B.C.,
CHEM-7 and chest X-ray.

148
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:00,590
All the tests came back normal.
There's nothing to explain his symptoms.

149
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,504
Okay, but let's pretend
there's something and go from there.
Who sees something on this M.R.I.?

150
00:11:06,684 --> 00:11:09,482
No lesions in the white matter.
No structural abnormalities.

151
00:11:09,557 --> 00:11:11,525
No space-occupying tumors.

152
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:16,532
He's 16, so he should have
an absolutely pristine brain.
The smallest thing is abnormal.

153
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,209
Meningeal enhancement.

154
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:22,842
- My bet is viral meningitis.
- Excellent.

155
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:24,855
Do you see what he did there?

156
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:28,692
Took a small clue that
there's a neurological problem
and wasn't afraid to run with it.

157
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:31,236
There's no evidence
of meningitis on that M.R.I.

158
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:33,207
No, there's not.
He's completely wrong.

159
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:35,303
Then what clue
are you talking about?

160
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:40,183
He knew that I saw something
on the M.R.I., so he figured there must be
something there and took a guess.

161
00:11:40,261 --> 00:11:43,753
- Clever, but also pathetic.
- So what did you find?

162
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:46,827
Take a close look at the corpus callosum.

163
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:52,918
- Looks okay.
- Are we all looking at the same thing?

164
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,458
Two hundred million
interhemispheric nerve fibers.

165
00:11:55,528 --> 00:11:58,588
The George Washington Bridge
between the left and right side
of the brain.

166
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,968
It's subtle.

167
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:07,383
There's some bowing. There.

168
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:09,447
An upward arch.
Are you guessing?

169
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,427
Yes.

170
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:15,265
- Too bad. You're right.
- He probably just moved.

171
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,935
Nobody stays perfectly still
for the entire M.R.I.

172
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:23,508
Yeah. Probably got restless
and shifted one hemisphere of his brain
to a more comfortable position.

173
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:26,857
Something is pushing on it.
If there was bowing,
could be a tumor.

174
00:12:26,934 --> 00:12:30,392
Do you see a tumor
on this M.R.I.?
No, but I don't see any bowing either.

175
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:34,002
There's no tumor.
Just a blockage causing pressure
causing symptoms.

176
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:37,520
Today, night terrors.
Tomorrow, he's bleeding
out of his eyes.

177
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:42,358
Get him a radionucleotide cisternogram.
I guarantee you'll see a blockage.

178
00:12:48,282 --> 00:12:50,273
Okay.

179
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:54,856
Easy.

180
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:57,195
Okay. Squeeze my hand.

181
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:03,104
All right. Squeeze hard.

182
00:13:05,688 --> 00:13:07,622
All right.

183
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:17,106
Now I'm injecting a material
that's tagged with a radioisotope.

184
00:13:17,182 --> 00:13:21,016
It's gonna enter your spine
and travel up to your brain.

185
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:24,992
It'll make you able to
think deep thoughts,

186
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:27,000
run a hundred miles an hour.

187
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:30,537
Easy.

188
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:46,468
Their eyes aren't the same color,
but that fleck in the eyes--

189
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:49,575
That's maybe a one-in-10 chance
if they're not related?

190
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:52,056
No. House isn't gonna pay you
based on that.

191
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:55,996
Any excuse we can give the folks
to justify a D.N.A. test?

192
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,200
We could tell them he's got Huntington's--
whole family should be tested
or they'll all die.

193
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,689
Hey.

194
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,628
There's a lot of blockage.
I've scheduled him for surgery.

195
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:13,536
We're gonna put a shunt
into one of the ventricles
to give the cerebrospinal fluid an out.

196
00:14:13,611 --> 00:14:16,239
No more pressure,
everything goes back to normal.

197
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:19,252
He's lucky to have you
as his doctors.

198
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:30,969
No formula. Just Mommy's
healthy, natural breast milk.

199
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,745
Yummy.

200
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:35,915
Her whole face just got
swollen like this overnight.

201
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:38,225
Mm-hmm.

202
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:41,568
No fever.

203
00:14:41,641 --> 00:14:44,474
Glands normal.
Missing her vaccination dates.

204
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:47,209
We're not vaccinating.

205
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:50,780
Gribbet! Gribbet!

206
00:14:50,863 --> 00:14:52,387
Gribbet!

207
00:14:52,466 --> 00:14:54,161
Think they don't work?

208
00:14:54,237 --> 00:14:57,536
I think some multinational
pharmaceutical company
wants me to think they work--

209
00:14:57,611 --> 00:15:00,842
pad their bottom line.
Mm-hmm.

210
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:03,217
- May I?
- Sure.

211
00:15:04,226 --> 00:15:06,888
Gribbet. Gribbet.

212
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:09,263
Gribbet.

213
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:12,238
Yeah. All-natural,
no dyes is a good business.

214
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,438
All-natural children's toys.

215
00:15:14,516 --> 00:15:17,007
Toy companies-- they don't
arbitrarily mark up their frogs.

216
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:20,115
They don't lie about how much
they spend on research
and development.

217
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:25,793
The worst that a toy company
could be accused of is making
a really boring frog.

218
00:15:25,876 --> 00:15:28,709
Gribbet, gribbet, gribbet.

219
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:31,615
You know another
really good business?

220
00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:33,919
Teeny, tiny baby coffins.

221
00:15:35,231 --> 00:15:37,495
You can get 'em
in frog green,

222
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:40,003
fire-engine red-- really.

223
00:15:40,075 --> 00:15:44,307
The antibodies in yummy Mummy
only protect the kid for six months,

224
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:46,978
which is why these companies
think they can gouge you.

225
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:50,788
They think that you'll spend
whatever they ask
to keep your kid alive.

226
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,891
Want to change things?
Prove 'em wrong.

227
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,566
Few hundred parents like you decide
they'd rather let their kid die
than cough up 40 bucks for a vaccination,

228
00:15:57,648 --> 00:16:00,139
believe me,
prices will drop really fast.

229
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:03,156
Gribbet, gribbet, gribbet,
gribbet, gribbet.

230
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:04,627
Gribbet.

231
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,528
Tell me what she has.

232
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:12,201
A cold.

233
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:14,374
There's a problem.

234
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:17,581
Complications in surgery?
Surgery went fine.
He's in recovery.

235
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,992
But we took a vial
of C.S.F. and tested it.
Really?

236
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:23,035
Turns out the bowing
wasn't the cause of his problems.
It was a symptom.

237
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:25,199
Oligoclonal bands
and increased intrathecal IgG.

238
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,442
Which means multiple sclerosis.
And the reason it takes
three of you to tell me this?

239
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,250
Because we're having a disagreement
about whether or not it is M.S.

240
00:16:32,327 --> 00:16:35,888
No lesions on the M.R.I.
It's early. He's had the disease
for maybe two weeks.

241
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:39,700
- McDonald criteria requires six months
to make a definitive diagnosis.
- Who cares about MacPhearson?

242
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:41,712
- I hear he tortured kittens.
- McDonald.

243
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:44,273
Oh, McDonald.
Wonderful doctor, loved kittens.

244
00:16:44,354 --> 00:16:46,322
The V.E.P. indicates slowing of the brain.

245
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:48,361
Without the lesions,
we can't be sure.

246
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:50,865
Well, if it is, it's gone from
zero to 60 in three weeks,

247
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:52,904
which would indicate
rapidly progressive M.S.

248
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:56,307
Not the fun M.S.
with the balloons and the bike rides
for cripples in wheelchairs.

249
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,510
- We should wait until--
- Start treating him now,

250
00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:03,855
maybe he can walk
for another couple of years,
maybe live for another five.

251
00:17:03,933 --> 00:17:06,458
Break it to the family.
I'm going home.

252
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,600
It'll take months
for a definitive diagnosis.
What'll happen to me?

253
00:17:12,285 --> 00:17:14,549
M.S. is an incredibly variable disease.

254
00:17:14,623 --> 00:17:18,024
If it is M.S., and we're not
a hundred percent sure.

255
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:20,567
What do you think is gonna happen?

256
00:17:23,911 --> 00:17:26,209
There are some medications
to manage the symptoms,

257
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:29,411
but as the disease progresses,
the problems will become more severe.

258
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:31,823
Bowel and bladder dysfunction,

259
00:17:31,896 --> 00:17:34,490
loss of cognitive function, pain--

260
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:37,060
So it's gonna hurt?

261
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:40,712
The brain's like a big jumble of wires.

262
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:43,344
M.S. strips them of the insulation,
and the nerves die.

263
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,051
Brain interprets it as pain.

264
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:49,394
But by starting treatment,
we're gonna prevent that
for as long as possible.

265
00:17:50,405 --> 00:17:52,339
We're looking into
a couple of specialists,

266
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,937
and until we get you squared away,
you'll stay here, okay?

267
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:19,156
Security checked the videotapes
from all perimeter cameras.

268
00:18:19,238 --> 00:18:21,468
He's still gotta be in the hospital.
Where's Chase?

269
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:24,103
Main floor.
Okay. You take the cafeteria
and administration.

270
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:26,777
I'll hit the research annex
and work my way back to you.

271
00:19:04,174 --> 00:19:06,165
Dan?

272
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:13,288
I'm not here. Leave a message.

273
00:19:19,643 --> 00:19:22,441
Dr. Cuddy.
Great outfit.

274
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:24,780
What are you doing
back here? Patient?

275
00:19:24,855 --> 00:19:28,347
No. Hooker. Went to my office
instead of my home.

276
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:41,186
Dr. House.

277
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:44,057
Dan's missing.
Yeah. I got that part from the message.

278
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:47,362
You said I was needed immediately.
He shouldn't move
after a lumbar puncture.

279
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,136
I agree. He's gonna have
a very nasty headache.

280
00:19:50,212 --> 00:19:53,340
That would also be my opinion
if consulted tomorrow morning.

281
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:56,582
We wanted to keep you informed.
He heard some pretty heavy news.

282
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:01,127
This is not a toddler wandering
around a department store.

283
00:20:01,204 --> 00:20:04,401
He's 16. You'll find him.

284
00:20:04,478 --> 00:20:06,412
I'm going home.

285
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:09,452
So when you say,
"Call me if you need anything",
you mean don't call?

286
00:20:09,523 --> 00:20:11,753
No, I mean call me
if I could do something.

287
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:15,958
I'm bad at search parties,
and I'm bad at sitting around
looking nervous, doing nothing.

288
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:18,062
What about his parents?
Should we call them?

289
00:20:18,143 --> 00:20:20,543
Why? Do you think
they're hiding him?

290
00:20:20,615 --> 00:20:22,583
Make sure someone
checks the roof.

291
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,455
Some of the orderlies
keep the door propped open
so they can grab a smoke.

292
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:04,909
Dan. You okay?

293
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:15,396
There are experimental treatments.
Ongoing research.

294
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,874
Who knows what they'll discover
in a year or two.

295
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:19,914
This is where I dropped the ball.

296
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:22,508
Dan, we're standing
on the roof of the hospital.

297
00:21:25,195 --> 00:21:27,186
Dan.

298
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:29,292
Dan, you're not on the field.

299
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,533
He doesn't know where he is.
Dan.

300
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,975
Foreman.

301
00:21:34,183 --> 00:21:35,946
Dan.

302
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,124
- Dan?
- Dan, no!

303
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:52,310
Dr. Foreman.

304
00:21:53,961 --> 00:21:55,952
I assume you found the kid.

305
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:58,627
He almost walked off
the roof.
Suicidal?

306
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:02,573
No, he thought he was on his
lacrosse field. Look, I was gonna
run home, shower, change--

307
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,581
Conscious?
Yeah.

308
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:08,248
How'd you talk him down?
Actually, Chase tackled him.

309
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,262
How come you didn't do it?

310
00:22:10,332 --> 00:22:12,766
Right. Well, I am black,
but he was closer.

311
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:17,335
Come on.
You can ride up with me.

312
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:27,761
Anybody tell the family that
their boy almost stepped off a roof?
They must be thrilled.

313
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,034
They're not suing,
but I think only because
Chase asked--

314
00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:32,636
Why does everybody
always think I'm being sarcastic?

315
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:34,911
This is great news.
He doesn't have M.S.

316
00:22:34,988 --> 00:22:38,685
Parents should be thrilled.
The mom anyway. Ofcourse,
the dad probably doesn't know--

317
00:22:38,764 --> 00:22:43,064
- Why doesn't he have M.S.?
- He was on the roof, thinking
he was on a lacrosse field.

318
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,008
- Conscious, and therefore not
a night terror. You want some of this?
- Yeah, sure.

319
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:49,175
He was in an acute
confusional state,

320
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:52,052
which doesn't fit with
a demyelinating disease like M.S.

321
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:54,187
Oligoclonal bands--
Were real.

322
00:22:54,266 --> 00:22:57,793
They just mean something
other than M.S.
So, what are they telling us?

323
00:22:57,874 --> 00:22:59,865
That the immune system
is working?
Right.

324
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:02,072
He has an infection in his brain.

325
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:04,142
What about sex?

326
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:07,452
Well, it might get complicated.
I mean, we work together.

327
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:10,590
- I'm older, certainly, but maybe you like that.
- I meant maybe he has neurosyphilis.

328
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:14,436
- Huh. Nice cover.
- Sorry. R.P.R. was negative.

329
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:17,970
We don't need
a definitive test to confirm.
Sure. Didn't need one to confirm M.S.

330
00:23:18,053 --> 00:23:22,547
Okay. Let's wait for you to
run titers on 1,400 viruses while
this kid's brain turns to mush.

331
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:26,225
So the fact that
he doesn't have M.S.,
it's-- it's really not good news after all.

332
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:28,433
Well, it is if it's neurosyphilis.

333
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:31,571
The likelihood of a false negative
on an R.P.R. test: 30%.

334
00:23:31,651 --> 00:23:35,143
Likelihood of a 16-year-old having sex:
roughly 120%.

335
00:23:35,226 --> 00:23:37,660
I'll start him on I.V. penicillin.
We're not gonna wait for that.

336
00:23:37,731 --> 00:23:41,258
The most effective way
to deliver the drug is
right into his brain via the spine.

337
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,274
We can't.
In a cramped space like the brain,

338
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:47,111
increased intracranial pressure
from a high-volume drug like penicillin
could herniate his brain stem.

339
00:23:47,187 --> 00:23:50,213
It'd kill him.
No neurologist in his right mind
would recommend that.

340
00:23:50,294 --> 00:23:53,127
Show of hands.
Who thinks I'm not
in my right mind?

341
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,068
And who thinks I forget this
fairly basic neurological fact?

342
00:23:57,142 --> 00:23:59,372
Who thinks there's a third option?

343
00:24:01,452 --> 00:24:05,388
- Very good. What's the third choice?
- No idea. You just asked
if I thought there was one.

344
00:24:09,203 --> 00:24:12,297
The patient has a shunt in his brain.
There'll be no increased pressure.

345
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:14,902
We can put as much penicillin
into his body as we want.

346
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:17,918
Excellent. Inject him through
a lumbar puncture.

347
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,958
One of us is gonna do this to you
twice a day for the next two weeks.

348
00:24:26,776 --> 00:24:29,540
- I'm ready. Go.
- He could get syphilis...

349
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:32,210
even if he's not sexually active?

350
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:36,693
Well, it's-- it's unusual,
but it's possible.

351
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:39,692
Okay. Relax.

352
00:24:52,503 --> 00:24:55,666
It's infected,
with a really big hole,

353
00:24:55,743 --> 00:24:58,109
like you stuck a nail in it
to relieve the pressure.

354
00:24:58,182 --> 00:25:01,174
I wouldn't do that.
Although the wound
is irregular.

355
00:25:01,256 --> 00:25:04,521
It's not cylindrical.
It's shaped like a triangle.
So, not a nail.

356
00:25:04,596 --> 00:25:06,655
- Steak knife?
- Wife's nail file.

357
00:25:06,735 --> 00:25:09,226
Nail file.

358
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,366
Yeah. Pain will make you
do stupid things.

359
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,474
- Something to take the edge off?
- Yeah.

360
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:19,617
Cheers.

361
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:26,465
So, you have family here
in Princeton?

362
00:25:26,546 --> 00:25:29,276
No.
Here on work?

363
00:25:29,353 --> 00:25:31,548
- No. Why are you--
- Does your penis hurt?

364
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,786
No. What?
Should it?

365
00:25:33,864 --> 00:25:37,391
No. Just thought I'd toss you
a really inappropriate question.

366
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:41,601
- Your lawyer's gonna love it.
- Why would I want to sue you?
I want you to treat me.

367
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:44,149
- You're from Maplewood,
New Jersey, right?
- Yeah.

368
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,484
Now, why would you
drive 70 miles...

369
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,494
to get treatment for a condition
that a nine-year-old could diagnose?

370
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:53,971
It's the free-flowing pus
that's the tip-off.

371
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:56,944
I was in town.
Not for family.
Not for work.

372
00:25:57,016 --> 00:26:00,349
You drove 70 miles
to a walk-in clinic.
You passed two hospitals on the road.

373
00:26:00,424 --> 00:26:03,916
Either you've got a problem
with those hospitals,
or they have a problem with you.

374
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:06,523
My guess is you've sued
half the doctors in Maplewood,

375
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:08,664
and the rest are now
refusing to help you.

376
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:12,473
It's ironic, isn't it?
Sort of like the boy who sued wolf.

377
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:15,782
You know, I bet we have
a doctor here named Wolf.

378
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,293
How perfect would that be?

379
00:26:18,365 --> 00:26:20,663
- I'm gonna page him.
- Okay. You know what?
Thank you.

380
00:26:20,737 --> 00:26:23,001
I'm gonna find a doctor
to take care of this.

381
00:26:23,076 --> 00:26:25,010
I didn't say I wouldn't treat you.

382
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,413
- We'll drain your knee,
run some lab work. Fix you up.
- Why would you do that?

383
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:30,422
I'm a people person.

384
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:33,017
You actually treated him?

385
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:35,067
All I know is he sued some doctors.

386
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,468
Who am I to assume they didn't
have it coming to them?

387
00:26:37,541 --> 00:26:40,874
The cutest little tennis outfit.
My God, I thought I was
gonna have a heart attack.

388
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:44,181
Oh, my. Didn't see you there.
That is so embarrassing.
How's your hooker doing?

389
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:46,191
Sweet of you to ask.
Funny story.

390
00:26:46,262 --> 00:26:50,062
She was gonna be hospital
administrator, but just hated
having to screw people like that.

391
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:52,936
- Heard you found her on the roof.
- You have very acute hearing.

392
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,705
You notify the parents?

393
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:56,716
In due course, ofcourse.

394
00:26:56,786 --> 00:27:00,278
And is there a paternity bet
on the father of the patient?

395
00:27:00,361 --> 00:27:03,660
Doesn't sound like me.
Well, it does, actually,
but doesn't mean you're guilty.

396
00:27:03,735 --> 00:27:05,726
You think?
I saw the parents in the lobby.

397
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:10,835
- Smart money's obviously on the father.
- My guy knows a guy who can
get you in for 50 bucks.

398
00:27:10,918 --> 00:27:14,820
Fine. Tell your guy, if I win,
you attend the faculty symposium,
and you wear a tie.

399
00:27:14,893 --> 00:27:17,361
And if I win,
no clinic hours for a week.

400
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:19,765
My guy will call your guy.

401
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:24,472
She's very good at her job.

402
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:31,224
The treatments should
start helping soon.

403
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:34,664
Let us know if it gets easier
to focus on things,
remember stuff.

404
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:40,134
Hey, Dan. Isn't Dr. Cameron's
necklace a beauty?

405
00:27:40,218 --> 00:27:42,277
Something South American, I think.

406
00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:44,325
Yeah. Guatemalan.

407
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:47,422
It's a cool necklace.

408
00:27:49,172 --> 00:27:51,834
- Thank you so much.
- The kid's in pain.

409
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:56,008
Don't fight it. Just let it happen.
No.

410
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:58,112
You'll be dead in two days.
No what?

411
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:00,457
I give it a day.
Dan? You okay?

412
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:01,691
Dan?

413
00:28:01,768 --> 00:28:04,236
Night terrors.
- Decomposition once he's in the grave.

414
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:07,208
- Say good-bye to
your mother and father.
- He's hearing voices.

415
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,748
You're dying.
It's all over, Dan.

416
00:28:10,988 --> 00:28:14,219
You're dying.
Dying. Dead!

417
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:18,292
Push two milligrams
I.V. Ativan, stat.

418
00:28:18,372 --> 00:28:21,000
It's all over.
- Come on, Dan.

419
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:22,909
Get out of my head!

420
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,712
Auditory hallucination shows
further brain degeneration.

421
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:31,820
Penicillin's not working.
So either it's
a bad batch of penicillin,

422
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:33,894
or our diagnosis is wrong.

423
00:28:35,745 --> 00:28:37,736
Square one.

424
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,752
Midnite.
L.F. T.'s, B.U.N. and creatinine are all normal.

425
00:28:41,825 --> 00:28:44,293
- Diabetes is out, and no gap.
- There goes metabolic.

426
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:47,026
- M.R.A. rules out vasculitis.
- "I" for inflammation.

427
00:28:47,104 --> 00:28:49,732
- Too young for anything
degenerative.
- "D", see ya.

428
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,074
"N" for neoplastic.
M.R.I. was clean.

429
00:28:53,152 --> 00:28:55,780
- "I" for inflammation.
- We already did that.

430
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:59,122
- Stupid to have two I's in one mnemonic.
What's the other one?
- Infection.

431
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:03,294
- Oligoclonal bands still have to mean something.
- But no fevers. White count's elevated,
but within range.

432
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:06,003
We've tested for anything remotely
possible. Everything's negative.

433
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:09,778
- C.T. scan rules out subdural.
- Trauma. Later much.

434
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:19,198
You know the problem?
"Midnight" is actually spelled
with a "G" and an "H".

435
00:29:20,213 --> 00:29:23,080
If we could just figure out
what those letters stand for.

436
00:29:27,262 --> 00:29:30,789
It's a sick brain,
having fun,

437
00:29:32,374 --> 00:29:34,535
torturing him, talking to him.

438
00:29:40,092 --> 00:29:42,083
Scaring the hell out of him.

439
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:49,336
Get him an E.E.G., left and right E.O.G.,
esophageal microphones.

440
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:53,281
If this thing wants to talk,
let's listen.

441
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:58,928
We're missing something.
This is screwed-up.

442
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:02,528
That's why you came up with
the brain talking to the virus thing?

443
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,407
I panicked, okay?

444
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:08,281
Sounded cool though.
They bought it.

445
00:30:10,862 --> 00:30:13,592
Oh, crap.

446
00:30:13,668 --> 00:30:18,196
Another reason I don't like
meeting patients. If they don't know
what you look like, they can't yell at you.

447
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:20,270
Here we go.

448
00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:25,925
How can you just sit there?

449
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,335
If I eat standing up, I spill.

450
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:32,464
Our son is dying,
and you could care less.

451
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:36,674
We're going through hell.
You're doing nothing?

452
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,490
- I'm sorry. You need to vent.
I understand.
- Don't be condescending.

453
00:30:42,568 --> 00:30:44,968
You haven't checked
in on him once.

454
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,702
Blood pressure is 110 over 70.

455
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,578
His shunt is patent, well-placed
in the right lateral ventricle.

456
00:30:50,653 --> 00:30:55,181
The E.K.G. shows a normal Q.R.S.
with deep-wave inversions throughout
both limb and precordial leads.

457
00:30:55,264 --> 00:30:58,165
L.F. T.'s are elevated,
but only twice the normal range.

458
00:30:58,237 --> 00:31:00,705
Oh, yeah. And he's hearing voices.

459
00:31:04,952 --> 00:31:06,943
Go hold his hand.

460
00:31:08,861 --> 00:31:11,455
Go on. I'll bus your tray.

461
00:31:25,432 --> 00:31:28,333
- Got any sample bags on you?
- I don't believe you.

462
00:31:28,406 --> 00:31:32,069
You're gonna run D.N.A. tests?
Their son is deathly ill.

463
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:36,278
I know. It's terrible.
But the fact is, if I don't keep busy
with trivial things like this,

464
00:31:36,357 --> 00:31:38,484
I'm afraid
I might start to cry.
You're an ass.

465
00:31:38,562 --> 00:31:41,463
Yeah? You want to double the bet?

466
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:54,856
General Hospital is on channel 6.

467
00:31:54,933 --> 00:31:58,494
Dan's brain's not showing
channel 6 right now.
Only mush.

468
00:31:58,575 --> 00:32:00,770
No epileptiform activity.

469
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,214
What are you doing?
Waiting for C.B.C. and CHEM-7.

470
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:08,190
Good. Run D.N.A. on these.

471
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:12,634
What's this?
Parents' coffee cups.

472
00:32:14,344 --> 00:32:16,744
I can't believe you.
I've had this conversation
once already.

473
00:32:16,816 --> 00:32:19,410
If you've got
something else to do, do it.
Otherwise, do this.

474
00:32:27,674 --> 00:32:30,734
Dr. House.
Hey. Mr. Funsten.

475
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,875
I was wondering
when you'd be back.
You got some papers for me?

476
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:37,391
You've caused me
considerable mental distress.
I certainly hope so.

477
00:32:38,432 --> 00:32:42,493
What? Too cheap to get
your lawyer to serve it for you,
or is it just more fun this way?

478
00:32:42,575 --> 00:32:44,770
I'm obviously prepared
to consider a settlement.

479
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:46,940
You have gonorrhea.

480
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:52,589
No, I don't.
Well, maybe you're right,
but I have the lab result says you do.

481
00:32:52,664 --> 00:32:55,258
Could be a false positive,
and normally I'd run a second test,

482
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:58,739
but since you're here,
I'll just go with the first.
You're just trying to scare me.

483
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:02,145
It's reportable, you know.
Public health issue.
I'll be sure to let my wife know.

484
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,848
Don't bother yourself.
The state will call for you.

485
00:33:04,926 --> 00:33:07,486
If you're clean, I'm sure
it'll all blow over. No big deal.

486
00:33:07,565 --> 00:33:10,898
There's an easy way to find out.
Get one of your doctors to run a test.

487
00:33:12,877 --> 00:33:14,811
Uh-uh.

488
00:33:14,882 --> 00:33:17,646
These are mine now.
I'll see you in court.

489
00:33:22,098 --> 00:33:25,966
West Nile negative. Not surprising
since not too many mosquitoes passing
through Jersey in December.

490
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:28,532
No eastern equine encephalitis.
You guys aren't gonna believe this.

491
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:32,550
What's that?
House is right.
The father's not the father.

492
00:33:32,623 --> 00:33:36,525
Dude doubled up on me.

493
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:38,658
You're not gonna believe this.

494
00:33:38,737 --> 00:33:41,228
The mother's not the mother either.

495
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:45,537
It's not a good idea
to move your son in his condition.

496
00:33:45,619 --> 00:33:48,213
- We just want a second opinion.
We need an answer.

497
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,485
You idiots.
You lied to me.

498
00:33:52,568 --> 00:33:54,502
We didn't lie about anything.

499
00:33:54,573 --> 00:33:57,770
- You, on the other hand,
accused us of molesting our son.
- Perfect.

500
00:33:57,847 --> 00:34:00,611
Can we get off my screwups
and focus on theirs?

501
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:02,780
Theirs is bigger.
You're not Dan's parents.

502
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:05,692
We're his parents.
He was adopted.
He doesn't need to know.

503
00:34:05,765 --> 00:34:07,756
- I do.
- Adoption makes us just as much--

504
00:34:07,836 --> 00:34:12,170
Listen. When we were taking
his medical history, were you confused?

505
00:34:12,247 --> 00:34:15,045
Did you think we were looking for
a genetic clue to his condition,

506
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,180
or did you think we were trying to
ascertain who loves him the most
in the whole wide world?

507
00:34:19,263 --> 00:34:21,424
How did you find out about this?

508
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,901
- I sampled their D.N.A.
- We didn't give you any D.N.A.

509
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:27,409
Your coffee cups from the cafeteria.

510
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:31,417
- You can't do that.
- Again, why are we getting
hung up on what I did?

511
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:37,326
- Your medical history is useless.
- No. We gave you a detailed history
of his biological mother.

512
00:34:37,404 --> 00:34:40,567
Her history.
Nonsmoker, good health,

513
00:34:40,644 --> 00:34:43,169
low cholesterol,
no blood pressure problems.

514
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,377
Dan was adopted two weeks
after he was born.

515
00:34:45,455 --> 00:34:49,789
- You have his history. There's nothing
you need to know that we didn't tell you.
- Sounds reasonable.

516
00:34:49,866 --> 00:34:52,926
Well, if you want to transfer
your boy, that is your choice.

517
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:55,702
I still think it's the wrong--
Was she vaccinated?

518
00:34:57,817 --> 00:35:00,786
The biological mother.
When she was a baby,
did she get her vaccinations?

519
00:35:00,857 --> 00:35:03,849
Dan was vaccinated.
At six months.

520
00:35:03,931 --> 00:35:07,628
Mm-hmm.
Do you know why kids
get vaccinated at six months?

521
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:10,334
Because before that
they are protected...

522
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:13,006
by their biological mother's
immune system.

523
00:35:13,085 --> 00:35:15,849
So, was she vaccinated?

524
00:35:19,633 --> 00:35:22,397
An infant picks up
a regular old measles virus.

525
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:24,407
Gets a rash.

526
00:35:24,477 --> 00:35:28,106
He's extremely uncomfortable,
has a wicked fever, but he lives.

527
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:32,054
Here's the kicker.
Once every million or so times,

528
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:34,426
the virus mutates.

529
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,025
Instead of Dan having
a fever and a rash,

530
00:35:37,107 --> 00:35:39,769
the virus travels
to his brain and hides,

531
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,780
like a time bomb.

532
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:44,217
In this case, for 16 years.

533
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,850
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.

534
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:51,724
I know. There's only been
20 cases in the United States
in the last 30 years.

535
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:55,139
I suppose you could make
an argument the kid's still in stage I.

536
00:35:55,215 --> 00:35:57,342
Once S.S.P.E. moves
to stage II, it's--

537
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,548
Boom. Stage II is universally fatal.

538
00:36:00,627 --> 00:36:03,596
I assume its impossible to know
when he might move into stage II.

539
00:36:03,668 --> 00:36:07,866
He's already started showing symptoms.
Could be a month. Could be tonight.

540
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:10,174
Can we treat it?
Ask the neurologist.

541
00:36:10,249 --> 00:36:12,342
Intraventricular interferon.

542
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:16,289
Not gonna shove a spike
into his brain and drip interferon
without confirming this diagnosis.

543
00:36:16,363 --> 00:36:20,129
- Tap him.
- We won't get a reliable result
for measles antibodies in his C.S.F.

544
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:22,139
Not after everything
we've given him.

545
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,008
So the wrong treatment kills
any hope of the right diagnosis.

546
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:27,847
Why do people lie to me?

547
00:36:27,923 --> 00:36:29,857
Could also kill him.

548
00:36:29,927 --> 00:36:34,364
Your ball, Foreman.
Tell me I don't have to
biopsy his brain.

549
00:36:35,941 --> 00:36:38,034
Well, there is one other way.

550
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,607
You sure this isn't gonna hurt?

551
00:36:41,688 --> 00:36:43,679
Yeah. It's just scary as hell.

552
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:45,886
See, we go through the pupil.

553
00:36:45,964 --> 00:36:48,194
But you won't feel it.
The eye's been paralyzed.

554
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:50,601
The needle travels
to the back of the eye,

555
00:36:50,674 --> 00:36:53,541
which is where we'll perform
the biopsy on your retina.

556
00:36:58,894 --> 00:37:01,920
So we've confirmed that
the problem is this mutated virus.

557
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:05,801
The treatment for S.S.P.E.
is intraventricular interferon.

558
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:08,606
We implant an ommaya reservoir
under the scalp,

559
00:37:08,682 --> 00:37:10,912
which is connected to
a ventricular catheter...

560
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:13,547
that delivers the antiviral
directly to the left hemisphere.

561
00:37:13,627 --> 00:37:17,461
You want us to consent to this?
I don't even understand
what you're talking about.

562
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,595
Well, the antiviral--

563
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,314
Look. I'm sorry.

564
00:37:24,384 --> 00:37:28,753
I can explain this as best I can,
but the notion that you're gonna fully
understand your son's treatment...

565
00:37:28,828 --> 00:37:32,958
and make an informed decision
is-- is kind of insane.

566
00:37:34,709 --> 00:37:36,973
Here's what you need to know.

567
00:37:37,983 --> 00:37:39,951
It's dangerous.

568
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:42,251
It could kill him.

569
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:44,316
You should do it.

570
00:37:55,422 --> 00:37:57,652
Did you need something else?

571
00:38:16,303 --> 00:38:19,431
You can't order a $3,200
D.N.A. test to win a bet.

572
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,671
It's not an actual cost.

573
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:25,617
I don't know if you know this,
but the hospital actually owns
the sequencing machine.

574
00:38:25,691 --> 00:38:28,285
- I'm serious.
- Tell the parents to submit
the bill to insurance.

575
00:38:28,365 --> 00:38:30,196
Insurance is not gonna
pay for a bet.

576
00:38:30,269 --> 00:38:34,638
Should. We don't make that bet,
the kid dies.

577
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:37,579
If not for the paternity bet,
I never would have taken their D.N.A.

578
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:42,454
Without their D.N.A., we never would have
discovered that Dan was adopted,
which was the key to this case.

579
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,498
You just don't want to pay your end.

580
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:47,468
Big mistake. My guy knows a guy.

581
00:38:47,541 --> 00:38:51,238
Fine. I will let you out of
clinic duty for one week,

582
00:38:51,317 --> 00:38:54,309
after you pay the 3,200
for the P.C.R. test.

583
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:03,632
Ooh.

584
00:39:03,712 --> 00:39:07,170
Well, now, there's
the hundred you owe me.

585
00:39:08,255 --> 00:39:10,189
Here's a hundred
I won from Cameron.

586
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:12,819
200 I took off of Foreman.

587
00:39:14,202 --> 00:39:16,670
And 600...

588
00:39:16,742 --> 00:39:19,233
I got from Wilson.

589
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,008
Very bitter.

590
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:27,988
Hey. Good morning.

591
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:30,831
Good news on your E.E.G.
Treatment is working.

592
00:39:30,907 --> 00:39:33,000
And your immune system is responding.

593
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,480
I know it's early,
but I just want to take a look.

594
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:41,725
All right.
Let's see what that brain
of yours can do.

595
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:45,257
Name as many animals as you can
that start with the letter "O".

596
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:47,398
Ostrich.

597
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,944
Ox. Old elephant.

598
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,853
Well, that's two better
than last time.

599
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:57,454
How you doing with
the whole adoption thing?

600
00:39:57,534 --> 00:40:00,332
- I knew since fifth grade.
- How's that?

601
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:03,343
Cleft chin.

602
00:40:03,415 --> 00:40:06,009
I have one.
My dad doesn't.

603
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:10,717
Looked it up on the Internet.
It's one of those trait things.

604
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:13,289
That's right. It's autosomal dominant.

605
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:18,743
Since neither of your parents have
cleft chins, it's highly unlikely
you're biologically related.

606
00:40:20,086 --> 00:40:24,785
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I've got no problems
with being adopted.

607
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,789
I love my parents.

608
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:33,545
How's he doing?
He's doing pretty well.

609
00:40:33,617 --> 00:40:35,175
He's a smart kid.

610
00:40:35,254 --> 00:40:37,222
I think he's gonna be fine.

611
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,332
- Hey.
- Thanks.
