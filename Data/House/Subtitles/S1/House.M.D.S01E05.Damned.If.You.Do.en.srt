1
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,535
We are condemned to useless labor.

2
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:09,541
Fourth circle of hell.

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:13,409
Charting goes a lot faster
when you eliminate
all classic poetry.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,881
Writing down what we already know
to be read by nobody.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,783
I'm pretty sure Dante would agree
that qualifies as useless.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,912
You're over two weeks behind
in your charting.

7
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,357
Oops. I missed.

8
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,418
- What are you, eight?
- Could an eight-year-old do this?

9
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:33,057
You'd better stop,
or it'll stick that way.

10
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,570
- You have a patient in Exam One.
- Yeah, but, see, I'm off at 12:00,
and it's already five of.

11
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:41,095
She's been waiting for you
since 11:00.

12
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:48,814
Melancholy without hope.
Which circle is that?

13
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,488
Hi. I'm Dr. House.

14
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,754
What seems to be the problem?
Show him your hands, Augustine.

15
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:11,499
- It-It looks like stigmata.
- Shh. Pius.

16
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,166
You must be all the talk
around the "holy water" cooler.

17
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,404
Been washing a lot
of dishes recently?
I help out in the kitchen.

18
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,505
- Anything new in the kitchen?
- We just got a donation
of saucepans and pots this week.

19
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:27,451
- I unpacked and washed them.
- Should have spent your time saving souls.
It's easier on the hands.

20
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,751
This is contact dermatitis.
You're allergic to dish soap.

21
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:35,420
Nonsense. We've always used that soap.
Why is there a problem now?

22
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:39,431
I've been a doctor for years.
Why do I have to keep assuring people
that I know what I'm doing?

23
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,933
Aperson can become allergic
to substances...

24
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,333
that they've had repeated
and prolonged exposure to.

25
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,897
The good news is-- free samples.

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,938
Diphenhydramine.
It's an antihistamine.

27
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:55,776
It'll stop the allergic reaction.

28
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,376
Take one every eight hours.
It might make you feel a little sleepy.

29
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:03,013
And get some of that
over-the-counter cortisone cream.
Thank you, Doctor.

30
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,387
You want some water?
I have some tea.

31
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,155
Well, you just relax for a few minutes.
That stuff works pretty fast.

32
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:18,392
Still out by 12:00.

33
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,237
How do you solve a problem
like dermatitis?
What?

34
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,835
Doctor? I want to thank you
for your patience.

35
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:30,576
She talkin' to you?
I don't know.
She's certainly looking at me.

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,051
Ah, it's good to get
a secular diagnosis.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,181
The sisters tend to interpret
their illnesses as divine intervention.

38
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,022
And you don't?
Then you're wearing
an awfully funny hat.

39
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:43,654
Ooh, boy.
Excuse me.

40
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,359
If I break my leg, I believe
it happened for a reason.

41
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,424
I believe God wanted me
to break my leg.

42
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,733
I also believe he wants me
to put a cast on it.

43
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,739
Doctor! Something's wrong.

44
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,445
Lift up your chin.

45
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,547
Sister, you're having an asthma attack.
I need you to relax.

46
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,559
Roll up her sleeve, please.
I'm gonna give you epinephrine.

47
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,460
It'll open your lungs and help you breathe.

48
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,575
What happened?
Did she take the pill?

49
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:42,746
- Yes.
- It's probably an allergic reaction.

50
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,484
She's allergic
to an anti-allergy medicine?

51
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,549
You figure somebody's
out to get her?

52
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,561
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

53
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,723
I'll put you on some steroids instead.

54
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,666
- Is my heart supposed to be feeling so funny?
- It's called adrenaline.

55
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,966
It makes your heart beat fast.

56
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,007
But not this fast.

57
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:06,102
Get a nurse, please.
Hold on.

58
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,670
Help! Somebody help us!

59
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,181
Somebody get in here!

60
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:19,187
Call a code and charge up a defibrillator.
She's got no pulse.

61
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:21,209
You diagnosed the patient
with allergies and prescribed antihistamine.

62
00:05:21,286 --> 00:05:24,255
She went into respiratory distress,

63
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:27,121
and you injected her
with epinephrine.

64
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:29,285
Presumably 1 c.c.

65
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:33,195
.1 c.c. That is the standard dose.
That is what I gave her.

66
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:35,290
People don't go into cardiac arrest
from .1 c.c. epinephrine.

67
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:38,632
She must have a preexisting heart condition
that got exacerbated by the epinephrine.

68
00:05:38,704 --> 00:05:40,638
It's too bad you didn't
make a notation in the chart.

69
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:42,640
I can make it up right now.

70
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,575
The drawer has syringes with both dosages.
You could have reached for the wrong--

71
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:48,078
- But I didn't.
- Everyone makes mistakes.

72
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:50,205
This is why doctors pay through the nose
for malpractice insurance.

73
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:52,807
Relax. They're not gonna sue.

74
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:55,079
The worst they'd do
is whack my hand with a ruler.

75
00:05:55,153 --> 00:05:58,554
- And the discipline board--
are they gonna whack your hand too?
- You're gonna report me?

76
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:02,320
- What choice do I have?
- Uh, how about not report me?

77
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:08,955
I can justify keeping her here
for a 24-hour observation.

78
00:06:09,034 --> 00:06:11,662
If you haven't found an underlying cause
for the cardiac arrest by then,

79
00:06:11,737 --> 00:06:13,671
I will have to notify our attorneys.

80
00:06:20,345 --> 00:06:22,176
Her hands were red and swollen.

81
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:25,580
Maybe she has a skin infection. Cellulitis?
That could manifest with tachycardia.

82
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,949
There's no history of fever.
Results from the C.B.C.
didn't indicate an infection.

83
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:33,081
The eosinophils are mildly elevated.
Sed rate's up a bit. Could we be looking
at a systemic allergic response?

84
00:06:33,158 --> 00:06:35,752
It's not allergic. Allergies don't cause
cardiac arrest like this.

85
00:06:35,827 --> 00:06:40,264
- Could be inflammation of the blood vessels.
- Vasculitis? That wouldn't give you
an elevated eosinophil count.

86
00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:42,129
Churg-Strauss vasculitis would.

87
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,862
The blood vessels of the heart,
lungs and skin become inflamed,

88
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:48,872
causing the asthma, rash and heart
problems-- covers all her symptoms.

89
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,272
You need a biopsy to diagnose.
Chest C.T. would be quicker.

90
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:54,278
The lady just came in
with a rash.

91
00:06:54,346 --> 00:06:56,280
What the hell are those?

92
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:58,282
Candy canes.

93
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,047
Candy canes?
Are you mocking me?

94
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,988
No. It-It's Christmas, and I--

95
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:09,823
I thought--
Relax. It's a joke.

96
00:07:09,895 --> 00:07:11,886
Isn't the prognosis
for Churg-Strauss a bit grim?

97
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:16,161
Yeah. Untreated, only 33% of patients
survive past a year.

98
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:19,726
Treated-- five years.
Then I definitely suggest treatment.

99
00:07:19,805 --> 00:07:22,171
If it was any other attending doctor,
I'd say that he made a mistake...

100
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,174
and gave her too much epinephrine.

101
00:07:24,242 --> 00:07:27,040
Saying you wouldn't say
it was my mistake...

102
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:29,205
is saying it was my mistake.

103
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,716
Everyone screws up.
Your rule.

104
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:35,048
I think you fit within
the subset of "everyone".

105
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,088
I didn't screw up.

106
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:42,252
- Order a chest C.T. and start the sister
on prednisone-- 40 milligrams T.I.D.
- The sister?

107
00:07:42,327 --> 00:07:46,923
Oh, didn't I mention?
The patient's a nun-- Sister Augustine.

108
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:49,523
I hate nuns.

109
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:53,337
Who doesn't?

110
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:08,548
- Sister Augustine?
- We weren't watching.

111
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,181
We were trying to see
if this is the bed control.

112
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:14,350
Oh. Uh, this one's
the bed control.

113
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:16,917
And that's the TV control.

114
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:20,294
I'm Dr. Cameron.
This is Dr. Chase and Dr. Foreman.

115
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:23,232
I haven't seen television
in over 20 years.

116
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:25,132
Do you consider it
the work of the devil,

117
00:08:25,203 --> 00:08:27,398
or do you just not get cable
where you live?

118
00:08:28,373 --> 00:08:31,069
- Um--
- How are you feeling, Sister?

119
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,542
I seem to be a little better.
They gave me some medication.

120
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:36,046
Prednisone. It's a steroid
to help with the inflammation.

121
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:38,548
Has Dr. House figured out what I have?

122
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:40,744
Will I be okay?
We're not sure what's wrong yet.

123
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:43,947
You'll have a chest C.T. scan this afternoon
that'll help with the diagnosis.

124
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:47,185
Dr. House is giving her medication,
and he doesn't know
what she has yet?

125
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:50,660
Trust, Sister Pius.
It all happens for a reason.

126
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:52,754
He doesn't know what he's doing.

127
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:55,800
The only problem that woman has
is that House grabbed
the wrong syringe.

128
00:08:55,867 --> 00:09:00,065
You don't trust him?
I don't trust a man who won't admit
he might be wrong.

129
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:03,471
I notice you weren't so quick to tell her
she's got Churg-Strauss and only
has a couple years left.

130
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,510
I don't tell patients bad news
unless it's conclusive.

131
00:09:05,577 --> 00:09:07,511
Because you know
he might be wrong.

132
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:09,911
About Churg-Strauss. Not about
what happened in the clinic.

133
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:13,417
What about you, Chase?
You think he's infallible too?

134
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:17,649
All I know is, if House didn't make a mistake
and Sister Augustine has Churg-Strauss,

135
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:20,623
he'll be self-satisfied
and our lives will be good
for a few weeks.

136
00:09:20,692 --> 00:09:24,560
If House did make a mistake,
he'll be upset and our lives
will be miserable for months.

137
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:26,756
There is that.

138
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:29,891
If Cuddy thinks I made a mistake,
the least she could do
is suspend me from clinic duty.

139
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:32,801
She doesn't confuse making a mistake
with being incompetent.

140
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:35,339
Oh, here we go-- lesson time.

141
00:09:36,474 --> 00:09:39,272
I recognize that confidence
is not my short suit.

142
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:42,074
I also recognize that I am human
and capable of error.

143
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:45,139
So you might have
screwed this up?
No.

144
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:48,617
So it's merely a theoretical
capacity for error.
Good point.

145
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:51,281
Maybe there isn't one.
Maybe that's my error.

146
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:54,587
Most people who think
as much of themselves as you do
like to talk about themselves.

147
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:58,390
Most people don't like to listen.
So, what's wrong with you?

148
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:12,165
Let me guess-- inflammatory bowel.

149
00:10:12,243 --> 00:10:16,009
Wow. Yeah. Is it that bad?
Yes.

150
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:19,448
It's also written on your chart.

151
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:21,747
"Bloody diarrhea, gas, pain.

152
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,845
Took sulfasalazine,
but it didn't work".

153
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:27,016
- No. Then-Then I--
- "Next, tried steroid enemas.

154
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:30,084
Oral corticosteroids--5-A.S.A.,
6-mercaptopurine".

155
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,356
- I'm impressed.
- By my medical history?

156
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,898
By how well
your last doctor charted.

157
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:37,332
It's one thing to have to go
to the bathroom every hour,

158
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:40,235
but when the kids
sit on my lap, it's--

159
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:42,398
The store sent me home.
They're gonna fire me.

160
00:10:42,474 --> 00:10:45,443
Can't you put me back on 5-A.S.A.?
Maybe it'll work this time.
Not likely.

161
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,276
I'm giving you a prescription.
It's cheap, which is good,

162
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,281
because your insurance company
won't pay for it.

163
00:10:58,957 --> 00:11:02,358
- "Cogaritis"?
- Cigarettes.

164
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:04,395
One twice a day.
No more, no less.

165
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:06,862
Studies have shown
that cigarette smoking...

166
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:09,593
is one of the most effective ways
to control inflammatory bowel.

167
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:13,035
Plus it's been well established
that you look 30% cooler.

168
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:16,562
- Are you kidding me?
- About the looking cooler, yeah.

169
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:19,405
- The rest is true.
- Isn't it addictive and dangerous?

170
00:11:19,477 --> 00:11:23,208
Pretty much all the drugs I prescribe
are addictive and dangerous.

171
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,875
The only difference with this one
is it's completely legal.

172
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,987
Merry Christmas.

173
00:11:30,055 --> 00:11:33,786
I was talking to the nurse-- Arsenio.
Do you know him?

174
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:38,022
Not really.
He can take pictures
with his phone.

175
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:41,554
Cool.
That woman from the lab
was interesting too.

176
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:44,761
She studied astrophysics
before becoming a nurse.

177
00:11:44,836 --> 00:11:48,795
You know the staff
better than I do.
I love to hear all about people.

178
00:11:48,873 --> 00:11:52,001
- Yet you live in a monastery.
- It's where I serve our Lord
and the world best.

179
00:11:52,077 --> 00:11:55,843
Our Lord maybe.
The rest of the world,
on the other hand,

180
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:59,680
- would probably get more
out of feeding the homeless or--
- Healing the sick?

181
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:03,710
As an example, yeah.
Did you always want
to be a doctor?

182
00:12:03,788 --> 00:12:07,849
Always.
You always want to be a nun?
My parents died when I was six.

183
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:11,555
I was raised in a foster home
run by the Church.

184
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:15,656
When I was 18, I went to the monastery,
where they let me take my vows.

185
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,931
I've known no other life,
and I haven't wanted to.

186
00:12:19,003 --> 00:12:22,530
Okay, Sister. We need you
to lie as still as possible.

187
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,598
If you get scared,
just let us know.

188
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:27,474
As Jonah said from inside the whale,

189
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:31,811
"When I had lost all hope,
I turned my thoughts to the Lord."

190
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:35,444
- Well, she's got God on her side.
- I don't believe in God.

191
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,853
You're not even a little agnostic?
Is it supposed to smell funny?

192
00:12:38,923 --> 00:12:42,825
Someone ralphed in there this morning.
We cleaned it up, but--

193
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:46,295
- It's normal, Sister.
It's just a few more minutes.
- Mm.

194
00:12:46,364 --> 00:12:49,492
I believe in a higher order
that's in control of what happens,

195
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:52,365
but not one, anthropomorphic entity
called "God"...

196
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,632
that's concerned with
the everyday workings of you and me.

197
00:12:54,706 --> 00:12:57,470
What else is there to control
but the everyday workings of you and me?

198
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,510
It's always about you, Foreman.

199
00:12:59,577 --> 00:13:01,374
What are you talking about--
the trees, the fish?

200
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,414
Should they be the ones that think
it's all about them?

201
00:13:03,481 --> 00:13:05,540
What about you, Chase?
Do you believe in God?

202
00:13:07,685 --> 00:13:12,054
I believe Sister Augustine
has no vascular pathology,
which means no Churg-Strauss.

203
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:14,523
Which means House made a mistake.
No, not necessarily.

204
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:18,392
It could be something else--
thyrotoxicosis or a carcinoid.
I don't get you.

205
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:22,194
You don't believe in God,
but you're willing to put
complete faith in one man?

206
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:25,600
Please. The smell.
Let's get her out of there.

207
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:29,106
I'm coming, Sister.
I gotcha.

208
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:31,608
Please. The smell.
I'm comin'.

209
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,906
I'm gonna be sick.
There's no smell.

210
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:39,245
No. God. Oh! It's Jesus.
It's Jesus!

211
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,751
He's coming for me!

212
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,288
He's burning me with his touch!

213
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:46,220
Let's get her on some Ativan.

214
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:50,125
The smells, religious visions--
it's symptomatic of temporal lobe swelling.

215
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:52,789
- We don't want her to--
- She's seizing.

216
00:13:52,864 --> 00:13:55,560
- Jaw block!
- Help me get her on her side.

217
00:13:58,002 --> 00:14:01,267
- Religious visions?
- Yeah. And next comes--

218
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,813
Patient tested positive
for herpetic encephalitis.

219
00:14:10,882 --> 00:14:13,442
- What's that tell us?
- Her immune system
is severely compromised.

220
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:17,079
Oh, I know. Prednisone
compromises the immune system.

221
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:22,422
- Isn't that the medicine that you gave her
for that thing she doesn't have?
- Yeah, that-- Hey.

222
00:14:22,493 --> 00:14:26,657
- I'm thinking that's a trick question.
- Her immune system
is severely compromised.

223
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:31,634
- Two doses of prednisone wouldn't do that.
- Are you hanging your diagnosis on an adverb?

224
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:36,731
- In 10 seconds, I'm going to announce that
I gave her the wrong dose in the clinic.
- You're gonna admit negligence?

225
00:14:36,808 --> 00:14:39,800
Unless you leave the room.
If you stay, you'll have to testify.

226
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:43,405
Five, four,

227
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:46,075
three, two--

228
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,118
So, there I was in the clinic, drunk.

229
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:50,245
I opened the drawer,
closed my eyes,

230
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:52,482
take the first syringe I can find --

231
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:57,192
So, what are the options
for a compromised immune system?

232
00:14:57,262 --> 00:15:02,393
Mixed connective tissue disease.
It'd explain why she was feeling better
on the prednisone.

233
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:05,493
Sure. She was feeling better
right up to the moment
it almost killed her.

234
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,266
On the other hand,
it explains the symptoms--

235
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:10,864
swollen hands, pulmonary problems,
cardiac problems.

236
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,842
It all fits.
Except her A.N.A. was normal.

237
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:15,641
- So redraw the blood.
- But the treatment is corticosteroids--

238
00:15:15,713 --> 00:15:17,943
prednisone-- and we can't go there
because of the encephalitis.

239
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:21,975
Then we'll treat it with something
that modulates the immune system
but doesn't suppress it--

240
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:24,851
hyperbaric oxygen chamber.

241
00:15:24,923 --> 00:15:29,690
There's no protocol for putting a patient
in a high-pressure oxygen room
to treat auto-immune problems.

242
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:32,127
Oh, you people.
Always with the protocols.

243
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:37,329
Prep the nun
and discontinue the prednisone.

244
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:46,001
I am both amused and annoyed...

245
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,568
that you think I should be
less stubborn than you are.

246
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:53,245
You are aware
of the Hippocratic oath, right?

247
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:57,584
The one that starts, "First, do no harm",
then goes on to tell us no abortions,
no seductions,

248
00:15:57,655 --> 00:16:00,351
and definitely no cutting
of those who labor beneath the stone?

249
00:16:00,425 --> 00:16:02,359
Yeah. I took a read once.
Wasn't impressed.

250
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:06,488
Hyperbaric treatments could cause
oxygen toxicity-- lung and eye damage.

251
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:09,055
Every treatment has its dangers.
Which is why we only treat...

252
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:11,761
if we're convinced the patient
actually needs the treatment.

253
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:14,498
I'm convinced.
You're not.

254
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:18,039
Question is, what are you
gonna do about it? Hmm?

255
00:16:21,112 --> 00:16:24,172
I have an opening Thursday at 3:00.
Do you have a fourth?

256
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:27,845
Is he any good?

257
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:29,910
Can I call you right back? Okay.

258
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,814
What's up?

259
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:40,595
The pressure will force the oxygen
into your system, saturate your blood.

260
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:43,725
It will enhance white cell activity,
reduce the inflammation.

261
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:46,929
And that will help with this
mixed connective tissue disease?

262
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:50,168
We'll be doing about 10 treatments,
and then we'll reevaluate.

263
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:53,608
The last treatment with prednisone
caused the seizures, right?

264
00:16:53,678 --> 00:16:57,546
How confident is Dr. House about this?

265
00:16:57,615 --> 00:17:00,379
That you reacted so strongly
to the prednisone let us know...

266
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:02,544
that you had an underlying problem
with your immune system.

267
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,078
I guess it was a blessing... of sorts.

268
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:13,157
So, who's your favorite
reindeer, Nurse Arnold?

269
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:15,165
Rudolph.
I would've thought
it was Vixen.

270
00:17:15,233 --> 00:17:18,600
What are you implying?
Nothing.

271
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:21,297
But I saw you at the Christmas party
with Dr. Riles...

272
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:23,806
and Dr. Jorkins
and Nurse Crandall.

273
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,900
I was just doing
some Christmas dancing.

274
00:17:25,977 --> 00:17:30,471
This is a chapel, a house of prayer.

275
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:32,675
House of prayer? Huh.

276
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,684
That explains the good reception.

277
00:17:34,752 --> 00:17:37,812
Also why nobody's ever here.

278
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:42,017
I need to talk with you, Dr. House.

279
00:17:42,093 --> 00:17:45,221
Sister Augustine believes in things
that aren't real.

280
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:48,795
I thought that was a job requirement
for you people.

281
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:53,360
She's been known to lie
to get sympathy.

282
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:55,702
She's a hypochondriac.

283
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:59,732
So you're warning me that I may
be treating a nonexistent ailment.

284
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:02,302
Sore throats, joint pains.

285
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,247
There's always something wrong,
and there's never a reason for it.

286
00:18:05,316 --> 00:18:07,341
Mother Superior plays right into it--

287
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:10,114
lets Augustine off work duties,

288
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:12,952
treating her as fragile, special.

289
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:15,822
That must make you angry.

290
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:17,884
It bothers me.

291
00:18:17,962 --> 00:18:20,430
It's not really
in Augustine's best interests.

292
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:27,469
You want some?

293
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:30,530
I shouldn't.

294
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:38,373
I guess you gotta
be good at reading people
to be a good infirmarian, huh?

295
00:18:38,449 --> 00:18:41,475
Mm. Mm-hmm.

296
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:44,180
So, we've got pride, anger, envy,
gluttony--

297
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:48,753
That's four out of seven deadly sins
in under two minutes.

298
00:18:48,826 --> 00:18:51,818
Do you people keep records of these things?
Is there a "Cathlympics"?

299
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:56,990
They say you have a gift.
They like to talk.

300
00:18:57,068 --> 00:19:00,595
- You hide behind your intelligence.
- Yeah. That's pretty stupid.

301
00:19:00,671 --> 00:19:03,663
And you make jokes because you're
afraid to take anything seriously.

302
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:06,005
Because if you take things seriously,
they matter.

303
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:09,171
And if they matter--
When things go wrong,
I get hurt.

304
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:12,341
- I'm not tough. I'm vulnerable.
- I barely know you.

305
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:15,613
And I don't know if I'm right.
I just hope I am.

306
00:19:15,686 --> 00:19:18,086
Because the alternative is...

307
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:20,624
you really are as miserable
as you seem to be.

308
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:26,656
You know, from the way
you're looking at me right now,

309
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:28,699
I'd say you just hit number five.

310
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:32,400
Lust.

311
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:47,580
Dr. Brown, I love you too.

312
00:19:56,127 --> 00:19:59,426
How are you feeling?
A little weak.

313
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:02,159
- That's from the oxygen.
- My mouth is dry.

314
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:05,600
Okay. Well, uh, I'll get you
some of your tea.

315
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:11,605
Mixed connective tissue disease?
Her A.N.A. is barely elevated.

316
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:14,406
Thanks for checking up on her.
Good to know you got my back.

317
00:20:14,478 --> 00:20:18,141
O2 sat's down to 83.
Pulmonary problems,
breathing problems.

318
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,241
Irritation from the oxygen
is typical.

319
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:23,219
She comes in with a rash,
and you put her into cardiac arrest.

320
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:25,448
That well just never
runs dry, does it?

321
00:20:25,523 --> 00:20:29,015
If there was no underlying problem,
why is she still having
the rapid heart rate?

322
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:31,721
Maybe from the herpetic encephalitis
caused by you giving her prednisone.

323
00:20:31,796 --> 00:20:33,991
Her reaction is a symptom,
not an error.

324
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,226
There's always an explanation,
isn't there?
Yes, there is.

325
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,235
And if this one doesn't work,
we'll find another.
But never one involving you screwing up.

326
00:20:39,303 --> 00:20:41,294
One that fits all the facts.

327
00:20:41,372 --> 00:20:44,671
Look, we obviously have
a difference of opinion,
and that's fine.

328
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:48,337
But, unfortunately, I've used up
all the time I budgeted today
for banging my head against a wall.

329
00:20:48,412 --> 00:20:51,848
I'm gonna do you the biggest favor
one doctor can do for another.

330
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,714
I am gonna stop you
from killing your patient.

331
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:57,185
You're off the case.

332
00:21:16,473 --> 00:21:18,668
We're gonna treat the symptoms.
Not the underlying condition?

333
00:21:18,742 --> 00:21:21,267
There is no underlying condition.
What's her status?

334
00:21:21,344 --> 00:21:23,403
The sister's breathing
is labored.

335
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,880
Pneumonitis
from the hyperbaric chamber.

336
00:21:25,949 --> 00:21:29,316
Put her on 40% oxygen
until her O2 sats increase.
B.U.N. and creatinine's rising.

337
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:31,946
A.L.T. and A.S.T. twice the normal range.

338
00:21:32,022 --> 00:21:35,617
Could be from the hypotensive episode.
Let's follow them with labs.

339
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:39,355
She still has the rash and joint pain
she came in with.

340
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:42,956
Order a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory.
When we were looking at the differential
diagnosis with Dr. House,

341
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:45,934
we were considering--
I don't need to hear
what Dr. House was considering.

342
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:49,438
All of this woman's symptoms can be
traced to Dr. House's considerations.

343
00:21:52,108 --> 00:21:54,042
Okay.

344
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:56,601
Let's just get this patient healthy.

345
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,410
I want her going out the front door
and not the back.

346
00:22:01,418 --> 00:22:03,352
Hey, it's not like
I betrayed him.

347
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,888
Cuddy would have found out about
the hyperbaric treatments eventually.

348
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:08,116
You did what you
thought you had to.

349
00:22:24,574 --> 00:22:26,508
Can't get enough
of this place, huh?

350
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:30,245
Came for my stethoscope.

351
00:22:30,313 --> 00:22:33,339
So I shouldn't read too much
into the fact that you
were looking for it...

352
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,407
in the drawer
with the epinephrine syringes in it?

353
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,580
Okay. Yeah, I'd like to clear
my reputation.

354
00:22:40,657 --> 00:22:44,218
Oh, right. I forgot how much
you care about what people think.

355
00:22:44,294 --> 00:22:47,127
Prescribing cigarettes
for inflammatory bowel?

356
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:49,290
That's, uh-- They cause
lung cancer, you know.

357
00:22:49,366 --> 00:22:52,130
You know why they have ribbons
for breast cancer,

358
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:55,968
colorectal cancer, prostate cancer--
and not for lung cancer?

359
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:58,007
They ran out of colors?

360
00:22:58,074 --> 00:23:00,634
It's because people
blame lung cancer patients.

361
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,644
They smoke. They screwed up.
They deserve to die.

362
00:23:02,712 --> 00:23:05,806
The reason people die
from lung cancer is guilt.

363
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:08,715
Huh. Well, guilt
does a lot of damage.

364
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:13,053
You said that
with great significance.

365
00:23:13,123 --> 00:23:16,957
You're not here to find your stethoscope.
You're not here to clear your reputation.

366
00:23:17,026 --> 00:23:21,190
You're here because you're having doubts.
You might have screwed up.

367
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:23,858
I'm here because, if I'm right,
Cuddy is killing that patient.

368
00:23:23,933 --> 00:23:26,299
Okay. But if you're wrong?

369
00:23:28,772 --> 00:23:30,706
Then she's saving her.
Fine.

370
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:33,174
You're gonna have to go through
every record of every patient...

371
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:35,734
who's been through this clinic
in the last two days.

372
00:23:35,812 --> 00:23:38,975
And you're gonna have to hope
that those records can be trusted.

373
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:41,243
Which, by the way, yours can't.

374
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:55,089
These pills will help your kidneys
function a little better, Sister.

375
00:24:02,105 --> 00:24:04,039
Get your wrist?

376
00:24:05,842 --> 00:24:08,242
What's that?

377
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:10,677
104.

378
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:13,739
Is that good?
It's fine.

379
00:24:15,018 --> 00:24:18,954
You're a lousy liar, Dr. Chase.

380
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:27,694
I have to get this.
Excuse me.

381
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,530
My mother's been dead
for 10 years.

382
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,638
But she's always with you in spirit.

383
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:37,798
What do you know about the nun?
Which one?

384
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:41,310
The cute one.
I think she likes me.

385
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:45,108
- The sick one, obviously.
- Her parents died when she was a child.

386
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:47,775
She's been with the Church
ever since.
What's she lying about?

387
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:50,319
- Why do you say that?
- I always say that.

388
00:24:50,386 --> 00:24:53,082
And the old nun thinks the sick nun
is a big fat nun liar.

389
00:24:53,156 --> 00:24:55,920
You know nuns.
What do you think?
I don't know nuns.

390
00:24:55,992 --> 00:24:58,984
You hate nuns. You can't hate someone
if you don't know them.

391
00:24:59,062 --> 00:25:01,622
Know any Nazis?
Maybe I hate them on principle.

392
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:05,895
I have a theory about
what makes good boys good.

393
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:09,302
It's not because
of some moral imperative.

394
00:25:09,372 --> 00:25:11,704
Good boys have the fear of God
put into them.

395
00:25:11,774 --> 00:25:14,834
Catholic Church specializes
in that kind of training--

396
00:25:14,911 --> 00:25:17,903
to make good boys
afraid of divine retribution,

397
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:20,108
so they'll do
what their daddies tell them--

398
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:24,085
like, for example, going into medical school
when it's the last thing they wanna do.

399
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:26,087
What do you think?

400
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:30,287
I think, if she did have a secret,
her boss would know.

401
00:25:35,865 --> 00:25:39,357
Did you paint or put in
new carpets recently?
No.

402
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:41,630
Any way she could have
got access to drugs?

403
00:25:41,704 --> 00:25:45,765
We lock all our medications in the infirmary,
and we don't keep prescription drugs here.

404
00:25:45,842 --> 00:25:50,108
Why haven't you asked Sister Augustine
about these things directly?

405
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:53,114
I've found that when you want
to know the truth about someone,

406
00:25:53,182 --> 00:25:55,946
that someone is probably
the last person you should ask.

407
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:58,647
Ah. And have you been speaking
to Sister Eucharist?

408
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:02,350
She ratted out her fellow sister
pretty quickly.
Oh.

409
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:04,655
If I were you, I'd have her repeat
a year of nun school.

410
00:26:04,727 --> 00:26:08,060
Well, becoming a nun
doesn't make you a saint.

411
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:10,565
Becoming a doctor
doesn't make you a healer.

412
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:14,467
And just because we live in a monastery,
and we spend most of our time in prayer,

413
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:17,404
doesn't mean we don't
find time for drama.

414
00:26:17,473 --> 00:26:19,338
So, what is the sick one's drama?

415
00:26:19,409 --> 00:26:24,142
Sister Augustine lived in Catholic
foster care until she came to us.

416
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:28,911
- Tea?
- Sure.

417
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:34,716
Do all of you lie?

418
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,316
It's a good strategy; it's simpler
when you all tell the same lie.

419
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:40,362
She has not spent her entire life
as a good Catholic.

420
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,366
When she had a cardiac arrest,
I had to open her blouse to do C.P.R.

421
00:26:44,434 --> 00:26:47,426
And I learned two things:
nuns can have nice breasts,

422
00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:51,997
and she has a tattoo on her shoulder--
of a skunk.

423
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:56,171
Now, maybe
it's the sacred skunk of Joseph,

424
00:26:56,245 --> 00:26:59,510
but, as far as I know,
Catholic foster care and monasteries...

425
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:02,380
do not keep tattoo parlors
in their refectories.

426
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:05,148
We consider that our life begins...

427
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:07,746
when we put on our habits
and take our vows.

428
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:13,418
- What happens before then--
- Is irrelevant to you,
but it's relevant to me.

429
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:20,866
Sister Augustine went into foster care
when she was six years old,

430
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:23,531
but she left when she was 12.

431
00:27:23,606 --> 00:27:26,473
She lived on the streets.
She got into drugs.

432
00:27:27,844 --> 00:27:29,937
When she was 15,
she became pregnant.

433
00:27:30,013 --> 00:27:31,947
Tried to self-abort.

434
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:34,950
She lost the child.
She became ill.

435
00:27:35,018 --> 00:27:36,952
We took her in
when she came back.

436
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,548
If we had thought
it was medically relevant,
we would have told you.

437
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:45,651
It's not.

438
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:57,570
This tea is delicious.
Local herbs?

439
00:27:58,574 --> 00:28:01,839
Any change
with the medication?
Yes. She's getting worse.

440
00:28:01,911 --> 00:28:05,210
Lung function's deteriorating.
B.U.N. and creatinine
continuing to rise.

441
00:28:05,281 --> 00:28:07,772
She's starting to run a fever,
and the rash is spreading.

442
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:10,080
At this rate, she's not
gonna make Christmas.
Maybe House is right.

443
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:12,485
Maybe there is an underlying condition
that explains the symptoms.

444
00:28:12,555 --> 00:28:15,149
Something we haven't considered.
Like what?

445
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:17,351
It could be a metabolic disorder.
Specifically?

446
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:19,361
Might be genetic.
Specifically?

447
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:21,761
I'm just saying--
You're just saying
you think House is right.

448
00:28:21,831 --> 00:28:24,356
Might be right.
Ofcourse he might be right.

449
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:27,267
It might be the hand of God at work.
Don't say it's something else...

450
00:28:27,336 --> 00:28:29,634
unless you've got
something concrete to offer.

451
00:28:31,941 --> 00:28:34,136
What's this, hemlock?

452
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:37,509
I'm gonna do you the biggest favor
one doctor can do another.

453
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,514
I'm gonna stop you
from killing your patient.

454
00:28:40,883 --> 00:28:44,876
It's figwort tea--
great for that little pick-me-up
we're all looking for in the morning.

455
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:48,549
Opens the lungs,
increases the blood pressure,
stimulates the heart.

456
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:52,526
Unfortunately, if you then get injected
with even .1 c.c. of epinephrine--

457
00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:55,155
instant cardiac arrest.

458
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:58,496
- Still, what the hell, it tastes great.
- Sister Augustine--

459
00:28:58,568 --> 00:29:01,059
Has been drinking it religiously,
so to speak.

460
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:04,129
And if you take the cardiac arrest
out of the equation--

461
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:08,405
All the rest of the symptoms
can be explained by a severe
long-term allergic reaction.

462
00:29:08,478 --> 00:29:10,639
Well, that's what Cameron
said in the beginning.

463
00:29:10,713 --> 00:29:14,308
Yes, she did. Well done.

464
00:29:14,383 --> 00:29:19,582
But your unwillingness
to stick by your diagnosis
almost killed this woman.

465
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:22,215
Take a lesson from Foreman--
stand up for what you believe.

466
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,924
Okay. Let's go figure out
how to save a nun.

467
00:29:27,997 --> 00:29:30,022
Damned if you do,
damned if you don't.

468
00:29:31,501 --> 00:29:33,435
Because it's been untreated for so long,

469
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:36,028
it's gone from a simple "watery eyes,
scratchy throat" allergy...

470
00:29:36,105 --> 00:29:38,437
to a whopping
"I'm gonna kick your ass" allergy--

471
00:29:38,508 --> 00:29:42,501
compromising her immune system,
diminishing her ability to heal
and breaking down her organ systems.

472
00:29:42,578 --> 00:29:46,014
So, what's the source?
The dish soap.

473
00:29:46,082 --> 00:29:49,108
No. The symptoms persisted days
after the dish-washing episode.

474
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:52,382
It's gotta be something she's been
exposed to here in the hospital
as well as the monastery.

475
00:29:52,455 --> 00:29:54,616
What about the tea?
It caused her arrhythmia.

476
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,624
Could be, but it's not definitive.

477
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:59,490
We'll skin-test for allergens.
Not yet. She's too reactive.

478
00:29:59,562 --> 00:30:01,496
She tests positive to everything.
We need to stabilize her--

479
00:30:01,564 --> 00:30:04,658
isolate her from all possible allergens--
give her system a rest.

480
00:30:04,734 --> 00:30:06,668
Get her in a clean room.
Okay.

481
00:30:06,736 --> 00:30:08,863
Then gradually introduce allergens
and see how she responds.

482
00:30:08,938 --> 00:30:11,805
When she reacts to something,
we'll know that's what's killing her.

483
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:16,211
There you go.
No television, no books.

484
00:30:16,279 --> 00:30:18,543
- Not even my Bible?
- I'm afraid not.

485
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:20,980
This room has filtered air,
filtered water.

486
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:24,918
You even have silk sheets--
very decadent and hypoallergenic.

487
00:30:24,987 --> 00:30:27,455
You should be feeling better here.

488
00:30:29,959 --> 00:30:33,122
We'll be back to check on you
in a little while.

489
00:30:33,196 --> 00:30:37,394
Can the other sisters
come in and pray with me?

490
00:30:38,668 --> 00:30:41,432
It'd be better if you
don't have any visitors.

491
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:44,098
Once we isolate
what's causing your allergy,

492
00:30:44,173 --> 00:30:46,107
then we can be a little more lax.

493
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:59,753
I-I can pray with you.

494
00:30:59,822 --> 00:31:02,552
I don't wanna die.

495
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,786
Why has he left me?

496
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,795
I was in seminary school.

497
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,139
They asked us once
what our favorite passage was.

498
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:24,373
I chose First Peter,
chapter one, verse seven.

499
00:31:26,616 --> 00:31:30,450
"These trials only test your faith
to see whether or not
it is strong and pure.

500
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:35,821
Your faith is being tested,
as fire tests gold and purifies it".

501
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:39,293
"And your faith is far more precious
to the Lord than mere gold.

502
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:41,694
"So if your faith remains strong
after being tested,

503
00:31:41,764 --> 00:31:46,394
"it will bring you much praise
and glory and honor...

504
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,804
on the day of his return".

505
00:31:49,872 --> 00:31:51,999
He hasn't left you.

506
00:31:56,045 --> 00:31:59,071
The only thing in the way of you
knowing he's there is your fear.

507
00:31:59,148 --> 00:32:04,848
You have a choice-- faith or fear.
That's the test.

508
00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:07,082
Choosing faith
doesn't mean I won't die.

509
00:32:07,156 --> 00:32:09,317
But it will affect
how you experience your death...

510
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:11,986
and, therefore, your life.

511
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:13,824
It's up to you.

512
00:32:13,896 --> 00:32:16,888
Why did you leave seminary school?

513
00:32:18,634 --> 00:32:21,228
That test.

514
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:23,898
You passed. I didn't.

515
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:28,539
We'll call you if anything changes.
Will she be all right?

516
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:32,547
As long as she's not exposed
to anything that can aggravate
her allergy, she'll be fine.

517
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:37,942
I need some help in here!

518
00:32:40,523 --> 00:32:43,583
Screw the procedure!
She's in anaphylactic shock!

519
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:45,889
No way. She's in a damn clean room.
You kidding me?

520
00:32:45,962 --> 00:32:47,896
Get in here!

521
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:52,594
. 1 c.c. of epi.
We've got to intubate.

522
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:55,102
I got it. Get the ambu bag.

523
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:09,317
I'm in.

524
00:33:21,464 --> 00:33:23,955
Breathing's stabilized.

525
00:33:25,334 --> 00:33:27,802
It's a clean room.

526
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:38,179
How do you get an allergic reaction
in a clean room?

527
00:33:40,116 --> 00:33:44,143
Maybe it was the preservatives
in the I.V.?
Checked that.

528
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,780
Latex tubing?
Checked that.
Checked everything.

529
00:33:46,856 --> 00:33:51,555
Well, it could be mast cell leukemia.
It can cause anaphylaxis.

530
00:33:51,627 --> 00:33:57,122
I checked the blood levels,
and it's not eosinophilia
or idiopathic anaphylaxis.

531
00:33:57,199 --> 00:34:00,327
Maybe it's just divine will.

532
00:34:00,403 --> 00:34:02,894
It's not my will.

533
00:34:07,109 --> 00:34:11,876
You do realize, if you're wrong--
about the big picture, that is--

534
00:34:11,947 --> 00:34:13,881
you're going to burn, right?

535
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:16,110
What do you want me to do--
just accept it, pack it in?

536
00:34:16,185 --> 00:34:19,643
Yeah. I want you to accept
that sometimes patients die
against all reason,

537
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:21,656
and sometimes they get better
against all reason.

538
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:24,215
No, they don't.
We just don't know the reason.

539
00:34:24,293 --> 00:34:26,989
I think the nuns
would agree with you on that.

540
00:34:36,172 --> 00:34:39,141
I just wanted to say that I know
that you did everything you could.

541
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:42,541
I don't need verification from you
to know that I'm doing my job well.

542
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:45,512
That's your problem, not mine.
I was just being nice.

543
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:48,345
Yeah, well, you don't need
to always do that.

544
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,685
Merry Christmas.

545
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:05,665
Sister Augustine's been extubated.

546
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,201
Good.
She's requested to check out,
against medical advice.

547
00:35:11,273 --> 00:35:13,207
She wants to go back
to the monastery.

548
00:35:13,275 --> 00:35:15,539
Well, talk her out of it.

549
00:35:15,611 --> 00:35:18,910
I think I may have
talked her into it.

550
00:35:35,764 --> 00:35:38,096
Room's paid up
for the rest of the week.

551
00:35:39,602 --> 00:35:41,536
Might as well stick around.

552
00:35:41,604 --> 00:35:45,870
This illness...
is a test of my faith.

553
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:50,139
If it's his will to take me,
it doesn't matter where I am.

554
00:35:50,212 --> 00:35:52,942
I can accept that.

555
00:35:53,015 --> 00:35:55,415
Does anybody believe
anything you say?

556
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:59,253
You're not accepting.

557
00:36:00,723 --> 00:36:02,657
You're running away.

558
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:04,886
Just like you always do.

559
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,793
You ran away from the monastery
to get laid.

560
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:12,864
You ran away from the real world
when getting laid didn't
work out so good.

561
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:16,735
Now things aren't working out again,
so off you go.

562
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:20,741
Why is it so difficult for you
to believe in God?

563
00:36:20,809 --> 00:36:25,143
What I have difficulty with
is the whole concept of belief.

564
00:36:25,214 --> 00:36:27,682
Faith isn't based on logic
and experience.

565
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,186
I experience God
on a daily basis...

566
00:36:31,253 --> 00:36:35,087
and the miracle of life all around--

567
00:36:35,157 --> 00:36:39,025
the miracle of birth,
the miracle of love.

568
00:36:39,094 --> 00:36:41,824
He is always with me.

569
00:36:41,897 --> 00:36:46,129
Where is the miracle in delivering
a crack-addicted baby?

570
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:48,534
Hmm?

571
00:36:48,604 --> 00:36:52,040
Then watching her mother abandon her
'cause she needs another score.

572
00:36:52,107 --> 00:36:54,234
Miracle of love.

573
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:57,108
You're over twice as likely
to be killed...

574
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:00,148
by the person you love
than by a stranger.

575
00:37:00,216 --> 00:37:03,413
Are you trying to talk me
out of my faith?

576
00:37:03,485 --> 00:37:07,319
You can have all the faith you want
in spirits and the afterlife...

577
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:10,187
and heaven and hell.

578
00:37:10,259 --> 00:37:12,989
But when it comes to this world,
don't be an idiot.

579
00:37:14,163 --> 00:37:17,599
'Cause you can tell me
that you put your faith in God
to get you through the day,

580
00:37:17,666 --> 00:37:20,692
but when it comes time
to cross the road,
I know you look both ways.

581
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:25,536
I don't believe he is inside me
and is going to save me.

582
00:37:25,608 --> 00:37:30,341
I believe he is inside me
whether I live or die.

583
00:37:30,412 --> 00:37:32,403
Then you might as well live.

584
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,750
You got a better shot
betting on me than on him.

585
00:37:38,621 --> 00:37:41,317
When I was 15,

586
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,884
I was on every kind of birth control
known to man--

587
00:37:45,961 --> 00:37:49,294
and I still got pregnant.

588
00:37:49,365 --> 00:37:54,268
I blamed God. I hated him
for ruining my life.

589
00:37:54,336 --> 00:37:56,270
But then I realized something.

590
00:37:56,338 --> 00:38:01,970
You can't be angry with God
and not believe in him
at the same time.

591
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:05,775
No one can.
Not even you, Dr. House.

592
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:14,912
How'd it go?
She has God inside her.

593
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,187
It would have been easier
to deal with a tumor.

594
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,490
Maybe she's allergic to God?

595
00:38:25,501 --> 00:38:28,436
We've looked everywhere
for an allergen that could
be causing this reaction...

596
00:38:28,504 --> 00:38:30,597
except one place-- inside her.

597
00:38:30,673 --> 00:38:34,040
On her medical history, she didn't
mention any surgery.
She had one.

598
00:38:34,109 --> 00:38:37,545
Can we get her records?
What hospital was it at?
She didn't have it at a hospital.

599
00:38:37,613 --> 00:38:40,707
Order a full body scan.
What if she refuses?

600
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:44,310
Tell her I'm looking
for a miracle.

601
00:38:45,454 --> 00:38:48,423
No piercings. No fillings.

602
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:52,153
No surgical pins in the arm.
No implants.

603
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:55,025
It's clean as a whistle.
What's House looking for?

604
00:38:56,598 --> 00:39:00,261
- What is that?
- Don't know.

605
00:39:00,336 --> 00:39:02,930
Lock on it.
Get a 3-D representation.

606
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,943
Oh, my God.

607
00:39:13,882 --> 00:39:18,444
The copper cross-- a form of birth control
pulled off the market in the '80s.

608
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,217
- So she's allergic to copper.
- Rare, but it happens.

609
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:24,122
Wouldn't she know
she had an I.U.D.?

610
00:39:24,193 --> 00:39:26,684
She had an abortion.
I.U.D. must have been left in,

611
00:39:26,762 --> 00:39:29,856
embedded in the endometrial tissue
where it couldn't be detected.

612
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:33,060
So, all we have to do
is remove the I.U.D.

613
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:35,433
Then the symptoms
should subside.

614
00:39:35,504 --> 00:39:40,203
I got this I.U.D. when I was 15.
It-It's been more than 20 years.

615
00:39:40,275 --> 00:39:43,369
Prolonged exposure to an allergen
with minimal symptoms.

616
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:47,939
But at some point.
all it takes is one last contact
to cause a full-blown reaction.

617
00:39:48,016 --> 00:39:51,349
Just like a balloon filled with air--
one last breath, it explodes.

618
00:39:52,354 --> 00:39:55,721
The first time I got the rash
was when I was washing
the copper cookware.

619
00:39:55,791 --> 00:40:00,751
And all your subsequent symptoms
came from ingesting food prepared in it.

620
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:03,320
Dr. House found his miracle.

621
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:05,333
I doubt he'll interpret it that way.

622
00:40:07,636 --> 00:40:09,661
You told me your favorite passage.

623
00:40:09,738 --> 00:40:11,729
Would you like to hear mine?

624
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:16,035
"Celebrate and be glad,

625
00:40:16,111 --> 00:40:19,046
because your brother was dead
and is alive again".

626
00:40:19,114 --> 00:40:22,083
The prodigal son.

627
00:40:22,151 --> 00:40:25,450
He'll be waiting for you
when you're ready.

628
00:40:27,289 --> 00:40:29,519
We'll schedule your surgery
for tomorrow.

629
00:40:36,565 --> 00:40:38,499
The sixth circle of hell.

630
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:42,298
Confined in a sweat box
with a bloody nose,
and all the tissues are soggy.

631
00:40:42,371 --> 00:40:44,635
I think that's the seventh.
No. The seventh is--

632
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:48,642
God, you must be fun at parties.
I think we both know
the flaw in that theory.

633
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,202
How's the sister?
Heart rate is normal,
kidneys functioning.

634
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:55,614
You know how it is with nuns.
You take out their I.U.D.'s,
they just bounce right back.

635
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:58,050
Great.
Told you I didn't screw up.

636
00:40:59,688 --> 00:41:02,885
You screwed up.
I gave her .1 c.c. of epinephrine.

637
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:05,552
Yeah, and if Cuddy hadn't taken you
off the case, you would have killed her.

638
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,999
You wanna come over
for Christmas dinner?

639
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:14,502
You're Jewish.
Yeah. Hanukkah dinner.

640
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,334
What do you care?
It's food. It's people.
No, thanks.

641
00:41:19,508 --> 00:41:23,945
Maybe I'll come to your place.
Your wife doesn't mind
being alone at Christmas?

642
00:41:24,012 --> 00:41:26,776
I'm a doctor.
She's used to being alone.

643
00:41:28,217 --> 00:41:30,276
I don't wanna talk about it.
Neither do I.

644
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:37,315
You did good with the nun.

645
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:42,125
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

646
00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:46,327
Merry Christmas, Dr. House.
Dr. Wilson.

647
00:41:47,636 --> 00:41:49,604
Good night.

648
00:41:51,273 --> 00:41:53,798
That was sweet.
