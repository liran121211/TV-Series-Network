1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,972
I didn't sleep well last night,
and I woke up with a scratchy throat.

2
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:11,809
I just don't feel so good. Uh, cough.

3
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:17,549
Yeah, um-um,
I have a bit of an upset stomach too,
and I think I'm running a fever.

4
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:22,620
I'm just worried
I might be contagious.

5
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:27,536
Inventory. Tomorrow.
I'm-- Yeah, I'm sure
I'll be feeling better by then.

6
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:30,876
Thanks, Mr. Innabe.

7
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,643
I cannot believe you just did that.

8
00:00:36,724 --> 00:00:39,557
I-I really do have a cough.

9
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:41,961
Oh. So you weren't lying.

10
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:46,697
You'd be curled up in bed
with a bowl of chicken soup--

11
00:00:46,774 --> 00:00:48,935
even if you didn't have
a horny girl in your bed?

12
00:00:49,011 --> 00:00:53,004
Yes.
Because I really do-- Hey.

13
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:57,749
I really do have a cough.
You also have a little rash.

14
00:00:57,826 --> 00:01:03,492
Um, I'm not sure
we should be kissing.

15
00:01:03,568 --> 00:01:07,732
Oh. It's okay.
Because I have almost
no interest in kissing you.

16
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:10,299
Perfect.
Good.

17
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:15,508
Uh-uh-uh.

18
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:20,860
Oh, baby.

19
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,917
Oh, Brandon.

20
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:59,980
Brandon.

21
00:02:01,363 --> 00:02:04,526
I know I'm good,
but come on.

22
00:02:07,005 --> 00:02:09,132
Brandon?

23
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:14,106
Brandon. Brandon. Brandon.

24
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:17,347
Brandon! Brandon!

25
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,404
Any additional R.N. to Surgical.
Any additional R.N. to Surgical.

26
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:12,336
Why do you want me to treat this guy?

27
00:03:12,413 --> 00:03:14,404
Blood pressure's not responding
to I.V. fluids.

28
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:17,077
No, no. I didn't ask how you plan to
con me into treating him.

29
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,817
I asked you why
you want me to treat him.

30
00:03:19,892 --> 00:03:22,554
He's sick. I care.
I'm pathetic.

31
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,292
There are about a billion sick people
on the planet. Why this one?

32
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:29,361
Because this one's
in our emergency room.
Ah, so it's a proximity issue.

33
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:32,433
If somebody was sick in
the third-floor stairwell,
that's who'd we be talking about.

34
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,675
Yes. I checked the stairwell.
It's clear.

35
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:38,243
Okay, then.
Emergency room guy it is.

36
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:41,985
Wait. Why was that so easy?
You know why.

37
00:03:43,263 --> 00:03:46,664
- Blood pressure's not responding to
I.V. fluids?
- Yeah.

38
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:50,903
That's just weird.

39
00:03:52,645 --> 00:03:55,773
C.B.C. was unremarkable.
Abdominal C.T. scan didn't show anything.

40
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:58,514
So, people, differential diagnosis.
What's wrong with her?

41
00:03:58,589 --> 00:04:00,523
- Him.
- Him. Her. Does it matter?

42
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:04,757
Does anyone think
it's a testicular problem? No. So, Chase?

43
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:07,824
- Yersinia infection?
- No. You wouldn't get the rash or cough.

44
00:04:07,904 --> 00:04:11,237
What about arthritis?
Accompanying vasculitis
causes nerve damage--

45
00:04:11,309 --> 00:04:15,109
- No. It wouldn't cause
the blood pressure problems. Allergy?
- The kid's got abdominal pain.

46
00:04:15,183 --> 00:04:17,447
Maybe carcinoid?
No. But then you wouldn't get the--

47
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,116
Foreman, if you're going to list
all the things it's not,
it might be quicker to do it alphabetically.

48
00:04:22,194 --> 00:04:27,325
Let's see, now. "Absidia". Excellent.
Doesn't account for any of the symptoms.

49
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:30,236
- No condition accounts for
all these symptoms.
- Oh, good.

50
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:33,368
Because I thought maybe he was sick.
But, apparently, he's not.

51
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:36,007
Who wants to do up
the discharge papers?

52
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,986
Okay. Unless we control
the blood pressure,

53
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:44,222
he's gonna start circling the drain
before we can figure out
what's wrong with him.

54
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:48,826
Treat him for sepsis, broad-spectrum
antibiotics, and I want a Cort-stim test
and an echocardiogram.

55
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:58,649
You all right?
Yeah.

56
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:02,885
The Cort-stim test will tell us
if your pituitary and adrenal glands
are working properly.

57
00:05:02,962 --> 00:05:06,125
- His glands? What does that mean?
- We have a few theories we're working on.

58
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,862
- You mean you don't know.
- Mindy.

59
00:05:08,938 --> 00:05:11,702
I'm just saying, if they knew
they wouldn't be testing you,
they'd be treating you.

60
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:16,735
Yeah, well, that's the way it works.
First we find out what it is,
then we get you better.

61
00:05:25,498 --> 00:05:28,558
You're half an hour late.
Busy caseload.

62
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:31,003
One case is not a load.

63
00:05:31,074 --> 00:05:34,908
So how are we doing
on cotton swabs today? If there's
an acute shortage, I could run home--

64
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,472
No, you couldn't.
Nice.

65
00:05:43,495 --> 00:05:46,862
Hello, sick people
and their loved ones.

66
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:51,268
In the interest of saving time
and avoiding a lot of boring
chitchat later, I'm Dr. Gregory House.

67
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:55,607
You can call me Greg.
I'm one of three doctors
staffing this clinic this morning.

68
00:05:55,682 --> 00:05:59,812
Short. Sweet. Grab a file.
This ray of sunshine
is Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

69
00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:03,380
Dr. Cuddy runs this whole hospital,
so, unfortunately, she's much
too busy to deal with you.

70
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:07,056
I am a board-certified diagnostician,

71
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,727
with a double specialty of
infectious disease and nephrology.

72
00:06:09,805 --> 00:06:13,639
I'm also the only doctor
currently employed at this clinic who is
forced to be here against his will.

73
00:06:13,711 --> 00:06:16,202
That is true, isn't it? But not to worry.

74
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:19,979
Because for most of you, this job could be
done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin.

75
00:06:20,055 --> 00:06:24,151
Speaking of which,
if you're particularly annoying,
you may see me reach for this.

76
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:27,891
This is Vicodin. It's mine.
You can't have any.

77
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:31,961
And, no, I do not have
a pain management problem.
I have a pain problem.

78
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:36,341
But who knows? Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe I'm too stoned to tell.

79
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:38,747
So, who wants me?

80
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:45,026
And who would rather wait
for one of the other two guys?

81
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:51,260
Okay. Well, I'll be in Exam Room One
if you change your mind.

82
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:56,410
Jodi Matthews?

83
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,780
Please accompany Dr. House
to Exam Room One.

84
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:07,357
Dr. Chase.

85
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:10,925
I'm not sure scaring your boyfriend
is the best medicine for him right now.

86
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:15,339
I know. I get stupid
when I'm scared.
Don't go rock climbing.

87
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:18,745
Look, I was wondering.
Before this happened, we were having sex.

88
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:25,148
What? You're wondering if
whatever he has, you might've gotten it?

89
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:28,221
It-It's unlikely.
We ran a complete S.T.D. panel, so--

90
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:32,965
No. I'm wondering if maybe
I did this to him. I was kind of rough.

91
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:43,653
It was yellow.
It was?

92
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:46,853
It's not anymore.
Well, that's a shame.

93
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:51,595
I thought that might be a problem,
so I brought you this.

94
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:59,104
Your mucus was "pale goldenrod".

95
00:07:59,184 --> 00:08:02,881
Last week, yes.
Should I be worried?
Oh, yes. Very.

96
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:06,393
Really?
I thought it was okay now.

97
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:08,954
And yet, here you are.
What happened?

98
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:11,594
Paramedics took a week
to respond to your 911 call?

99
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:14,572
You're not a very nice doctor,
are you?

100
00:08:14,643 --> 00:08:17,373
And you are very bad at
whatever it is you do.

101
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:20,746
You don't even know me.
I know you're gonna get fired.

102
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,916
That's why you got the new glasses.
That's why your teeth are sparkly white.

103
00:08:24,993 --> 00:08:28,485
You're getting the most of
your health insurance while you still can.

104
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,992
I might be quitting.

105
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:36,566
If you were quitting, you'd have known
that last week when your snot was still
pale goldenrod. You're getting fired.

106
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:40,911
I just don't like being told what to do.

107
00:08:44,926 --> 00:08:47,554
I can get you in
for a full body scan later this week.

108
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:50,122
Thanks.

109
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:55,639
It's got to be viral.
We should start running gels and titers.

110
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:59,807
Maybe we should look into
the girlfriend's theory.
She thinks she rode him to death.

111
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:03,252
What'd you tell her?

112
00:09:03,323 --> 00:09:05,791
I told her 22-year-old men
don't die of sex.

113
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,953
- What'd you ask her?
- What do you mean?

114
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:11,023
I mean, I hope you got some specifics
on exactly what was going on.

115
00:09:11,103 --> 00:09:14,937
If the girl thinks it could kill you,
it's worth knowing about.

116
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:20,473
Have you ever taken a life?

117
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:32,001
We should stop the antibiotics.

118
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,004
It's too soon to say
they're not having an effect.

119
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,167
They're having an effect.

120
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:41,342
His B.P.'s falling fast.
There's fluid filling his lungs.

121
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,683
His creatinine is rising.

122
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,691
His kidneys are shutting down.

123
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:57,403
Our treatment isn't making him better.
It's killing him.

124
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:05,816
So, we had six symptoms that didn't
add up to anything. Now we got seven.
Who's excited?

125
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:09,555
I don't think it complicates things.
The kidney failure was caused by
the antibiotics.

126
00:10:09,632 --> 00:10:14,296
- Maybe.
- Typically, low blood pressure
and abdominal pain means an infection.

127
00:10:14,374 --> 00:10:17,275
An abdominal infection causes sepsis,
low blood pressure.

128
00:10:17,345 --> 00:10:20,280
Except we checked for
abdominal infections.

129
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:24,342
But what if it's the other way around?
What if the low blood pressure's
causing the abdominal pain?

130
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,917
Viral heart infection.
The intestines aren't getting
enough blood, and the result is belly pain.

131
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:32,956
- I know it's not
the standard presentation.
- It's a 10 million-to-1 shot.

132
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:35,700
I thought that's what we dealt with here.

133
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:41,441
It explains the cardiomyopathy, the pain,
the low B.P., the fever.

134
00:10:43,454 --> 00:10:47,618
You read the book.
Impressive.

135
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:53,189
It's a ludicrously long shot that
explains every one of those symptoms--
except for the cough and the rash.

136
00:10:53,271 --> 00:10:56,934
Should we just erase those?
Well, anything can cause a rash.

137
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,046
Okay. Cardiac infection.

138
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:06,489
- Cameron, you thought allergy.
- Mm-hmm.

139
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:10,957
Chase, what was it you thought?
Carcinoid?

140
00:11:11,033 --> 00:11:13,797
Then there's hypothyroidism.

141
00:11:13,871 --> 00:11:17,671
Could be parasites.

142
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:22,516
Finally, sinus infection.

143
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:26,215
If you're gonna list
all the things it can't be,
you're gonna need more colors.

144
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:30,625
Cameron was right.
No condition explains all these symptoms.

145
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:36,932
- But orange and green covers everything.
- Orange and green?

146
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,035
Two conditions contracted simultaneously?

147
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:43,379
Occam's Razor.
The simplest explanation
is always the best.

148
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,422
- And you think one is simpler than two?
- Pretty sure it is, yeah.

149
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:53,421
Baby shows up. Chase tells you that
two people exchanged fluids
to create this being.

150
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:58,099
I tell you that one stork
dropped the little tyke off in a diaper.
Are you gonna go with the two or the one?

151
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:00,806
- I think your argument is specious.
- I think your tie is ugly.

152
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:05,944
Why is one simpler than two?
It's lower, lonelier. Is it simpler?

153
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:09,118
Each one of these conditions
is about a thousand-to-one shot.

154
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:12,859
That means that any two of them
happening at the same time
is a million-to-one shot.

155
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:15,768
Chase says the cardiac infection
is a 10 million-to-1 shot,

156
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,433
which makes my idea
10 times better than yours.

157
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:21,309
Get a calculator. Run the numbers.

158
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:22,906
We'll run the tests.
Tests take time.

159
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:26,819
Treatment's quicker.
Start the kid on Unasyn
for the sinus infection,

160
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:31,521
and... what was orange?
Hypothyroidism.

161
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:35,763
My uncle has hypothyroidism.
Not like this.

162
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,468
Intravenous Levothyroxin
is an artificial thyroid medication
that should take care of it.

163
00:12:39,545 --> 00:12:43,037
Also, the nurses are going to
start you on Unasyn.
It's a more targeted antibiotic.

164
00:12:43,118 --> 00:12:44,779
For the sinus infection?
Yes.

165
00:12:44,854 --> 00:12:48,517
- The other stuff is
for something else entirely.
- Bad luck, huh?

166
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:52,324
Don't worry. He should be
back to ditching work in no time.

167
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,800
Brandon?

168
00:12:57,642 --> 00:13:01,976
Hey, Mom.

169
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,812
We're his parents.
How's he doing?

170
00:13:03,885 --> 00:13:06,376
Um, Brandon is--

171
00:13:06,456 --> 00:13:11,086
Uh, Mom. Dad--
This is Mindy.

172
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:17,396
I was gonna bring her home for Christmas.
Um, we're engaged.

173
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,954
Dr. Hall to the recovery room.
Dr. Hall--

174
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:32,690
Did you tell the family House's theory?

175
00:13:32,766 --> 00:13:36,759
Two odd conditions striking
completely coincidentally
at the exact same time?

176
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,831
I didn't phrase it
quite that way.
They agree to treatment?

177
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:43,244
Ofcourse they did. We're doctors.
They believe whatever we tell them.

178
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:45,978
So, is that our job?
House's puppets?

179
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:48,887
He comes up with an insane idea,
we get to pretend it's not?

180
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,122
His insane ideas are usually right.
We've been here long enough to--

181
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,359
We've been here long enough
to have Stockholm syndrome.

182
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:59,099
What, because we don't hate him?
He thinks outside the box.
Is that so evil?

183
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:01,838
He has no idea where the box is.

184
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:06,577
If you guys think he's right, go home.
Relax. Just wait for
the kid to get all better.

185
00:14:06,654 --> 00:14:09,487
I'm going to the lab
to test for viral infections.

186
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,008
Negative for Coxsackie "B" virus.

187
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:25,744
Seven down, about 5,000 to go.

188
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,120
You really think we're gonna
come up with your mystery virus just by
running gels till we guess it right?

189
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:35,692
No. I think we're gonna do it
by standing around
watching other people work.

190
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:39,535
I'm waiting for
the Epstein-Barr virus.

191
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,345
- She's weird, isn't she?
- Bad idea.

192
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,751
- What?
- Bad idea. You work with her.

193
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,759
What did I say?

194
00:14:50,828 --> 00:14:56,494
Is weird some new
ghetto euphemism for sexy,
like bad is good and phat is good?

195
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:59,096
- Then what the hell does "good" mean?
- "Ghetto euphemism"?

196
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:02,405
You don't think she's hot?

197
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,277
No.

198
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,810
Wow. Then you're brilliant.
And I am using "brilliant" as a euphemism.

199
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:12,224
Obviously, the girl is hot.
Y-You're not talking about her aesthetics.

200
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:14,730
You're talking about
if I want to jump her. I don't.

201
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,859
Brilliant.

202
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:23,711
Your Epstein-Barr is ready.

203
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:31,690
What are you doing?
Level four.

204
00:15:31,761 --> 00:15:35,322
No, no. I mean--
I know what you meant.
We're waiting.

205
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,768
My throat hurts.
So you said.

206
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,334
How long are we waiting?
Two minutes less than when
you asked me two minutes ago.

207
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:51,086
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm Dr. Cuddy.
Nice to meet you.

208
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,824
Dr. Cuddy, thanks for the consult.
His throat seems to have some condition.

209
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:01,971
Say "Ah".
Ah.

210
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,107
He has a sore throat.

211
00:16:06,953 --> 00:16:10,116
Ofcourse. Yes, why didn't I--

212
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:14,127
I mean, because he said that
it hurt, and I should have deduced
that meant it was sore.

213
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:16,689
I was in a board meeting.
Patients come first, right?

214
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,430
Wouldn't want to prescribe a lozenge
if there's any doubt about
its efficacy, huh?

215
00:16:19,506 --> 00:16:23,670
You once asked me
why I think I'm always right,
and I realized that you're right.

216
00:16:23,747 --> 00:16:26,875
At least, I think you're right.
I don't really know, now do I?

217
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:32,455
- Hey. I'm here.
- Go home. Drink some hot tea.

218
00:16:37,303 --> 00:16:39,498
Excellent counsel.

219
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:42,906
Negative on parvovirus B-19.

220
00:16:42,978 --> 00:16:46,141
I'm impressed.
Thank you.
I was born to run gels.

221
00:16:46,217 --> 00:16:49,345
I meant about Chase.
What about Chase?

222
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:53,084
Well, the man has no
physical interest in you.

223
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:58,657
He has a completely professional
relationship with you, respects you
as a colleague and a doctor.

224
00:16:58,737 --> 00:17:02,730
And yet, he can't look at you
without thinking sex.

225
00:17:02,811 --> 00:17:04,745
Because I asked
what kind of sex could kill you?

226
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:08,443
You now have total control
over your relationship with him.

227
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:12,855
So, a woman can't express
her interest in sex without it
being some professional power play?

228
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:16,762
No. If you look the way you do
and you say what you said,

229
00:17:16,834 --> 00:17:19,735
you have to be aware of the effect
that it's going to have on men.

230
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:23,139
- Men should grow up.
- Yeah, and dogs should stop
licking themselves.

231
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:24,803
It's not gonna happen.
What's going on?

232
00:17:26,283 --> 00:17:28,808
- Yeah, what are you doing here?
- Looking for you guys.

233
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:30,980
- Why didn't you page us?
- 'Cause I knew you'd be here.

234
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:33,150
Who told him?
No one.

235
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:37,824
I assume you're trying to prove
my crazy, two-illness theory wrong,
so, obviously, you're gonna be in the lab.

236
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:39,927
- You spin the urine?
- Not yet.

237
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:42,530
Talk to me when you have.

238
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:54,182
What'd you find out?
Kidney failure.
It's acute interstitial nephritis.

239
00:17:55,264 --> 00:18:00,497
- I wonder if that's significant.
- It means the antibiotics
didn't cause the kidney failure.

240
00:18:00,572 --> 00:18:02,506
How'd you know?

241
00:18:02,576 --> 00:18:06,034
If you guys hadn't been so busy
trying to prove me wrong,
you might've checked in on the poor kid.

242
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:08,413
You visited a patient?

243
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:12,546
I was sitting by his bed all morning, just
so he'd know someone was there for him.

244
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,423
I looked in on him.
He's much better.

245
00:18:14,495 --> 00:18:17,430
Ergo, the treatment's working.
Ergo, me right, you wrong.

246
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,866
Hey, I'm glad for the kid.

247
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,843
That smugness of yours
really is an attractive quality.
Thank you.

248
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:31,250
It was either that
or get my hair highlighted.
Smugness is easier to maintain.

249
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:34,315
I get that you're not
a big believer in the
"catching flies with honey" approach,

250
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:37,887
but do you honestly think
you'll collect a jarful
by cleverly taunting them?

251
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,800
Flies, no. Doctors, sure.
If I'd said to Foreman,

252
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:44,399
"Nice try. Great guess,
but sorry, not this time",
what do you think he'd be doing right now?

253
00:18:44,478 --> 00:18:48,812
I think he'd go home
not feeling like a piece of crap.
Exactly.

254
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:52,548
You want him to
feel like a piece of crap?
No. I don't want him going home.

255
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:59,394
Dr. Foreman.

256
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:02,802
Still have the cough.
I'm feeling a lot better though.

257
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:06,038
His fever is gone.
His rash is going away.

258
00:19:06,114 --> 00:19:10,107
I see.
Is everything okay?

259
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:14,021
Just ordering some tests.
Absolutely nothing to worry about.

260
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:36,022
- How much longer?
- 9:30. I figure she was on
the eighth hole when I paged her.

261
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:42,535
You probably got another half hour.

262
00:19:47,448 --> 00:19:53,353
I ran a T.S.H., T3 and T4.
The patient's negative for hypothyroidism.
I'm not talking about you.

263
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:57,452
The fact that he's getting better would
indicate the unreliability of the tests.

264
00:19:57,532 --> 00:20:00,524
If I'm right and it's a viral infection,
one of two things always happen:

265
00:20:00,603 --> 00:20:04,095
the patient dies,
or the patient's immune system
fights off the invader.

266
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:06,076
What's with her?

267
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:10,138
Her leg hurts after running six miles.
Who knows? Could be anything.

268
00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:13,279
He's getting better.
That doesn't prove you're right.
That just proves he's getting better.

269
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:18,254
It-It's not two illnesses.
It can't be two illnesses.

270
00:20:18,332 --> 00:20:21,199
I am so glad you work here.

271
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,933
If I'm right,
the antibiotics you prescribed...

272
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:28,173
could box his kidneys and liver,
impeding his ability
to fight off the virus.

273
00:20:28,249 --> 00:20:33,414
- It could kill him.
- Well, that certainly would be a concern.

274
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:35,220
Fifty bucks?

275
00:20:35,293 --> 00:20:37,989
Don't look away.
The space monkeys
will be all over you.

276
00:20:38,065 --> 00:20:40,659
- You wanna bet on the patient's health?
- You think that's bad luck?

277
00:20:40,736 --> 00:20:45,366
You think that God will smite him
because of our insensitivity?

278
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,844
Well, if God does,
you make a quick 50.

279
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:54,578
- Oh.
- Go check his white blood count.

280
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:57,822
If he's fighting off a virus
like you think, it'll be way up.

281
00:21:03,673 --> 00:21:07,871
Hey. Cuddy said you needed a consult.
What's up? I'm busy.

282
00:21:16,728 --> 00:21:18,821
Oh!

283
00:21:24,508 --> 00:21:27,500
- I was just being glib.
- You haven't said anything.

284
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:33,382
No. Before, when I was talking about
Brandon's girlfriend thinking sex
could kill you.

285
00:21:33,456 --> 00:21:35,754
I was just making a joke
because I was uncomfortable.

286
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:38,693
Oh, I don't even
remember what you said.
I'm uncomfortable about sex.

287
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:45,197
- Well, we don't have to talk about this.
- Sex could kill you.

288
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:48,369
Do you know what
the human body goes through
when you have sex?

289
00:21:48,447 --> 00:21:50,938
Pupils dilate. Arteries constrict.

290
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:54,044
Core temperature rises, heart races,
blood pressure skyrockets.

291
00:21:54,123 --> 00:21:57,422
Respiration becomes rapid and shallow.

292
00:21:57,495 --> 00:22:00,828
The brain fires bursts of
electrical impulses
from nowhere to nowhere.

293
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:02,698
Secretions spit out of every gland,

294
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:06,934
and the muscles tense
and spasm like you're lifting
three times your body weight.

295
00:22:07,011 --> 00:22:11,675
It's violent, it's ugly,
and it's messy.

296
00:22:11,752 --> 00:22:17,588
And if God hadn't made it
unbelievably fun, the human race
would've died out eons ago.

297
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,158
Men are lucky
they can only have one orgasm.

298
00:22:23,238 --> 00:22:27,265
You know that women
can have an hour-long orgasm?

299
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,335
Hey, Foreman. What's up?

300
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,645
- Hey, Foreman.
- Hey.

301
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:37,886
- White cell count isn't up, is it?
- No. We were both wrong.

302
00:22:37,962 --> 00:22:41,125
White cell count is down--
way down-- and dropping.

303
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,692
His immune system is shot.
We need to get him into a clean room.

304
00:22:50,716 --> 00:22:53,708
Can you walk, Brandon?

305
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:55,778
Yeah. A little.

306
00:22:55,858 --> 00:23:00,318
Okay. 'Cause we'll need to
leave the chair outside. Thank you.

307
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:03,027
Where's April? April?

308
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:07,938
Can you take that chair, please?
Thank you.
Yes, Robert.

309
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:11,345
I'll need to take your, um--
your mask and your robe too.

310
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:22,824
You might wanna block your ears
for this, it's quite loud.

311
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,581
Something's made him
immuno-compromised.

312
00:23:35,656 --> 00:23:40,150
His white blood cell count is down,
which means his body
can't fight off infections.

313
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:44,564
If he gets sick, he'll die.
Sick? How sick?

314
00:23:44,638 --> 00:23:47,300
If he gets a cold, he'll die.

315
00:23:57,593 --> 00:24:03,429
Okay. I'm gonna push the needle
into your hip bone
and take some of the marrow.

316
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,874
That's not so bad.

317
00:24:07,943 --> 00:24:12,380
Uh-uh. That was just the anesthetic.

318
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,114
The core biopsy needle,
it's a bit bigger.

319
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:22,356
Hey, man. Take a deep breath.
This-This is gonna hurt... a lot.

320
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:31,242
Your marrow makes the blood cells.

321
00:24:33,084 --> 00:24:35,450
We take a peek at it
under a microscope,

322
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:39,515
and maybe we find a viral infection.

323
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:41,620
Maybe we find some fibrosis.

324
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:45,691
Something to explain why
your blood count is so low.

325
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:48,640
There we go.

326
00:24:50,145 --> 00:24:52,375
One step closer to an answer.

327
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:55,442
If you don't find one,

328
00:24:57,324 --> 00:24:59,884
I can't stay here forever.

329
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:11,268
- The patient could've died.
- The one with the pulled muscle?

330
00:25:11,347 --> 00:25:16,182
Those symptoms are consistent
with a dozen other conditions.

331
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:19,156
I'm entitled to a consult.
- You are not getting out of clinic duty.

332
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:23,857
Come on. You got a hundred other
idiot doctors in this building who go...

333
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:27,631
all warm and fuzzy every time
they pull a toy car out of a nose--
you don't need me here.

334
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:30,871
No, I don't. But working with people
actually makes you a better doctor.

335
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:34,040
When did I sign up for that course?
When did I give you
the impression that I care?

336
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:39,050
Working in this clinic obviously instills
a deep sense of compassion.

337
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:43,620
I've got your home number, right?
In case anything comes up at 3:00
in the morning.

338
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,328
It's not gonna work.
You know why?

339
00:25:46,405 --> 00:25:48,896
Because this is fun.

340
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:52,877
You think of something to make
me miserable. I think of something
to make you miserable--

341
00:25:52,949 --> 00:25:57,613
It's a game, and I'm gonna win
because I got a head start.
You are already miserable.

342
00:26:01,597 --> 00:26:03,497
Uh--
Is this important?

343
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,501
Uh, no.
Good.

344
00:26:07,506 --> 00:26:09,440
What's with you and her?
Don't.

345
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,671
You have a thing for her?
The only people who can get to you--

346
00:26:11,746 --> 00:26:13,907
No. There is not a thin line
between love and hate.

347
00:26:13,983 --> 00:26:19,148
There is, in fact, a Great Wall of China,
with armed sentries posted every 20 feet
between love and hate.

348
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:21,557
Thirty-six Vicodin.
Who's the patient?

349
00:26:21,629 --> 00:26:23,460
I am.
You can't--

350
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:26,024
Dr. Wilson is
the prescribing physician.
Yeah.

351
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:30,267
You will lie, cheat and steal
to get what you want, but you're
incapable of kissing a little ass?

352
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:32,278
We all have our limitations.

353
00:26:32,347 --> 00:26:36,579
House?
Wrong bottle. Do me a favor.

354
00:26:36,654 --> 00:26:41,648
Take one of these,
wait five minutes for it to kick in,
then find Cuddy and kiss her ass.

355
00:26:43,331 --> 00:26:46,323
What was the kid's first symptom?

356
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:49,895
You did the history.
Of his 800 symptoms,
which one hit him first?

357
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,910
Uh, the cough.

358
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:20,656
Gout.

359
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:29,129
Um, are we talking about Brandon?
Gout?

360
00:28:29,206 --> 00:28:31,140
Uric acid crystals in the joints?

361
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:37,079
The symptoms are pain,
swelling, redness, stiffness.
Not one of which do I see on that board.

362
00:28:37,152 --> 00:28:39,450
Because he doesn't have gout.

363
00:28:41,793 --> 00:28:44,125
Every day, cells die.

364
00:28:47,135 --> 00:28:50,593
We survive because the remaining cells
divide and replace the losses.

365
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:57,775
The colchicine, a gout medicine,
blocks mitosis and stops cell division,

366
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:02,356
which will result in
abdominal pain, rash,

367
00:29:02,427 --> 00:29:07,091
nausea, fever, kidney failure,
low blood pressure...

368
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:09,193
and will also mess with the bone marrow.

369
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:11,433
But he doesn't have gout.
Why would he have gout medication?

370
00:29:11,508 --> 00:29:14,966
Because you guys were right.
He didn't have two conditions
at the exact same time.

371
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:18,505
First, he got a cough.
And because he's an idiot,
he went to a doctor.

372
00:29:18,587 --> 00:29:22,546
In order to justify charging $200,
that doctor felt
he should actually do something.

373
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,289
Oops. He wrote a prescription.

374
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:29,199
Seven thousand people die each year
from pharmacy screwups.

375
00:29:29,271 --> 00:29:31,205
Not nearly as many as die
from doctor screwups,

376
00:29:31,275 --> 00:29:33,903
but still, not something
they use in their promotional materials.

377
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:37,470
The pharmacist gave him
gout medicine instead of cough medicine.

378
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:39,712
And the only thing it wouldn't do,

379
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:43,781
it would do absolutely nothing
to relieve his cough.

380
00:29:43,862 --> 00:29:45,887
Occam's Razor--

381
00:29:45,965 --> 00:29:49,765
the simplest explanation is
almost always that somebody screwed up.

382
00:29:49,838 --> 00:29:53,831
But once he checked into this hospital,
he was completely in our control.

383
00:29:53,911 --> 00:29:56,072
Our food, our pills, our everything.

384
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:58,811
So even if you're right,
no more gout medication.

385
00:29:58,887 --> 00:30:01,879
He'd either continue to deteriorate,
or he would've gotten better.

386
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:04,792
But he got better,
and then he got worse.

387
00:30:04,862 --> 00:30:07,330
It doesn't fit.
It doesn't make sense.

388
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,392
Okay. Two people screwed up.

389
00:30:10,472 --> 00:30:12,997
Not as simple as one, but--

390
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:25,187
He's resting. He's--
I'm Dr. House.

391
00:30:25,263 --> 00:30:29,256
I'm your son's physician.
Oh. You're the one
we haven't met yet.

392
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:33,739
You're the one he hasn't met.
How can you treat someone
without meeting them?

393
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,973
It's easy if you don't
give a crap about him.

394
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:39,540
That's a good thing.

395
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,023
If emotions made you act rationally, well,
they wouldn't be called emotions, right?

396
00:30:44,094 --> 00:30:47,928
That's why we have
this nice division of labor.
You hold his hand, I get him better.

397
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,662
If I start tucking him in at night,
well, that's not fair to you guys.

398
00:30:50,738 --> 00:30:53,172
And if you start prescribing medicine,
well, that's not fair to me.

399
00:30:53,243 --> 00:30:56,974
So, what I wanna know is,
who stepped on my side of the net?

400
00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:01,918
Who cared enough
to get stupid enough
to give him his cough medicine?

401
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,924
When we checked in, Dr. Foreman--

402
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:07,987
Tuesday, he's getting better.
Wednesday, he's getting sick again.

403
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:11,764
Somebody gave him
his cough medicine Wednesday.

404
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,671
Come on. Nobody's gonna be mad.

405
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:22,243
I just wanna know
who tried to kill the kid.

406
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:30,723
- Dr. House, maybe we should--
- His throat was sore.

407
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:37,075
Page Dr. Occam.
He's gonna wanna hear about this.
I'm sorry.

408
00:31:37,148 --> 00:31:41,312
He was coughing,
and I just wanted to help him--
Aren't you a dear.

409
00:31:41,388 --> 00:31:45,256
Where are the pills?
He took the last of'em before
he was switched into that room.

410
00:31:45,328 --> 00:31:46,989
They're all gone?
It was just cough medicine.

411
00:31:47,064 --> 00:31:49,692
No, it wasn't.
Where's the bottle?

412
00:31:58,048 --> 00:32:00,744
We need to know
exactly what you put in this bottle.

413
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,754
We think it was colchicine,
a gout medication.

414
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:05,815
If the prescription said cough medicine,
that's what I dispensed.

415
00:32:05,895 --> 00:32:08,056
The family is prepared
to waive liability, all right?

416
00:32:08,132 --> 00:32:12,296
We just need to know what it was,
what dosage it was--
It was cough medicine.

417
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:14,864
Refill it.

418
00:32:16,812 --> 00:32:20,646
He's gonna be okay.
You don't know that.

419
00:32:22,556 --> 00:32:26,048
Does Brandon like
that quality in you?

420
00:32:26,128 --> 00:32:28,289
You're a little negative.

421
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:34,504
Things don't always
work out for the best.
Doesn't hurt to hope they do.

422
00:32:34,576 --> 00:32:39,411
No. Not unless that makes you figure
you can do whatever you want,
like give people cough medicine.

423
00:32:40,852 --> 00:32:45,312
This is cough medication.
This is what Brandon
was supposed to get.

424
00:32:45,393 --> 00:32:48,089
They're small, round and yellow.

425
00:32:48,165 --> 00:32:52,499
Can you tell this man what
the pills in your son's medicine bottle
actually looked like?

426
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:57,436
They were small, round and yellow,
exactly like this.

427
00:32:57,513 --> 00:32:59,674
Those were the pills
that Brandon was taking.

428
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:04,847
Hey, I'm just a pharmacist,
but I know what
cough medicine looks like, Doctor.

429
00:33:09,032 --> 00:33:12,365
It was so perfect.
It was beautiful.

430
00:33:12,437 --> 00:33:15,600
Beauty often seduces us
on the road to truth.

431
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,112
And triteness kicks us in the nads.

432
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:23,346
So true.
This doesn't bother you?

433
00:33:23,422 --> 00:33:26,755
That you were wrong?
I try to work through the pain.

434
00:33:26,828 --> 00:33:31,822
I was not wrong.
Everything I said was true.
It fit. It was elegant.

435
00:33:31,903 --> 00:33:37,569
- So, reality was wrong?
- Reality's almost always wrong.

436
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,751
The cough medicine did something.

437
00:33:46,828 --> 00:33:49,524
Aggravated the condition.

438
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,658
It's all over the place.
Must be in his blood.

439
00:33:52,737 --> 00:33:55,467
- What if it is his blood?
- Lymphoma?

440
00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:57,874
Unless you've got something better.

441
00:33:57,946 --> 00:34:01,438
We foolishly ruled out lymphoma because
his C.T. scan showed no adenopathy,

442
00:34:01,518 --> 00:34:06,217
C.B.C. showed a normal differen-smear,
bone marrow showed no--
Screw the tests.

443
00:34:06,293 --> 00:34:09,194
Do an exploratory laparotomy
and find out what's in there.

444
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:13,963
He has no blood pressure,
no immune system and no kidneys.
Surgery will kill him.

445
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:18,066
Yeah, you're right.
Let's stick with the wrong pill theory.

446
00:34:22,085 --> 00:34:25,418
I'll schedule him for surgery.

447
00:34:29,431 --> 00:34:32,594
Okay, Brandon, we're running this tube
through your heart....

448
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:35,763
and into the pulmonary arteries
in your lungs.

449
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:39,277
The sensors will give us
information we need for the exploratory
surgery later this afternoon.

450
00:34:43,821 --> 00:34:46,654
- My fingers are numb.
- Try not to move.

451
00:34:46,726 --> 00:34:51,993
We're in the right atrium,
trying to catch the flow
through the tricuspid valve.

452
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:54,764
I think the catheter's curling
in the atrium.

453
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:59,299
Got it. We're in the R.V. now.

454
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,008
Ectopy.

455
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:05,485
- You must've irritated the heart wall.
- It'll calm down.

456
00:35:05,557 --> 00:35:08,390
- He can't tolerate any cardiac arrhythmia.
Pull back.
- He needs the surgery.

457
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:23,606
Pressure's dropped.

458
00:35:23,687 --> 00:35:26,247
- You still with us, Brandon?
- Get the curtains.

459
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,919
V.F.

460
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:41,609
Charging. Clear.

461
00:35:44,454 --> 00:35:48,117
Sinus rhythm.

462
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:51,858
I got a pulse.

463
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:57,102
Yeah, but no surgery today.

464
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:07,313
- How're you doing?
- Okay.

465
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:09,724
Great. I'm doing good too.

466
00:36:09,796 --> 00:36:13,129
I get to knock off an hour early today.
You know why?

467
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:16,967
Because I kissed my boss's ass.
Do you ever do that?

468
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,703
I think she just said yes 'cause
she wants to reinforce that behavior.

469
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:23,442
Wants me to kiss a lot of
other people's ass,
like she wants me to kiss yours.

470
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,683
What would you want?
A doctor who holds your hand
while you die,

471
00:36:27,758 --> 00:36:30,192
or a doctor who ignores you
while you get better?

472
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:34,199
I guess it would particularly suck
to have a doctor
who ignores you while you die.

473
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:38,200
- I should go.
- You think it's gonna come out on its own?

474
00:36:43,217 --> 00:36:46,948
Are we talking
bigger than a breadbasket?

475
00:36:47,024 --> 00:36:49,891
Because, actually,
it will come out on its own.

476
00:36:49,962 --> 00:36:54,956
Which for small stuff is no problem.
It's wrapped up in a nice,
soft package, and plop.

477
00:36:55,037 --> 00:36:56,868
Big stuff, you're gonna rip something,

478
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,636
which, speaking medically,
is when the fun stops.
How did you--

479
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:03,738
You've been here half an hour,
you haven't sat down.
That tells me its location.

480
00:37:03,818 --> 00:37:06,981
You haven't told me what it is.
That tells me it's humiliating.

481
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:10,925
You have a little birdie carved on
your arm. That tells me you have
a high tolerance for humiliation.

482
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:14,363
So I figure it's not hemorrhoids.

483
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:20,007
I've been a doctor 20 years.
You're not gonna surprise me.

484
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:25,280
It's an MP3 player.

485
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:33,390
Mm.

486
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:39,303
Is it-- Is it because of the size,
or the shape,

487
00:37:39,377 --> 00:37:42,107
or is it the pounding bass line?

488
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:44,877
What are we gonna do?

489
00:37:48,124 --> 00:37:50,558
- I'm gonna wait.
- For what?

490
00:37:52,732 --> 00:37:54,893
Okay. It's 3:00. I'm off.

491
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:58,302
Would you tell Dr. Cuddy
there's a patient in Exam Room Two
needs her attention?

492
00:37:58,374 --> 00:38:01,537
And the R.I.A.A. wants her to check
for illegal downloads.

493
00:38:02,815 --> 00:38:05,306
Brandon's not ready for surgery.
Okay.

494
00:38:05,385 --> 00:38:09,549
Let's leave it a couple of weeks.
He should be feeling better by then.
Oh, wait. Which way does time go?

495
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:12,959
He crashed during prep.
He's also experiencing
pain in his fingers.

496
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:15,022
Think some bug
may have gotten in the clean room.

497
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:19,596
I think we should double his dosage
of G-CSF to temporarily boost
his white blood cell count.

498
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:23,612
Pain in his fingers. Right.

499
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:34,197
Hi again.
He can't--

500
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:37,259
Where's he going?

501
00:38:38,374 --> 00:38:40,535
Hey. How you all doing?

502
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:45,070
Interesting fact. Every seven years,
it's a whole new you.
Inspiring metaphor, huh?

503
00:38:45,151 --> 00:38:48,814
Dr. House,
this is a clean room.
Yeah. I read the sign.

504
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:53,589
But cells of different organs
reproduce at different rates.

505
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:57,157
- So, you get a new kidney
every three years.

506
00:38:57,238 --> 00:38:59,570
Get a new stomach lining every week.

507
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:03,873
This is why colchicine poisoning
causes all these symptoms,
but not all at once.

508
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:06,440
But we went to the pharmacy.
We saw the pills.

509
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,512
Colchicine does its damage
in a very specific order.

510
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:13,858
First of all, there's the pain in
the abdomen, the rash, the fever.
Isn't that what you got first?

511
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:18,391
Then the kidneys go,
which is exactly what happened to--

512
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:20,372
- Brandon.
- Right.

513
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:25,471
Then it screws up your bone marrow,
and then neuropathy.

514
00:39:25,551 --> 00:39:29,078
A painful tingling
in the fingers and toes.

515
00:39:29,156 --> 00:39:31,716
And what do you suppose
happens after that?

516
00:39:35,735 --> 00:39:39,569
Hair loss. The bad news is...

517
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:43,077
your special boy is doing drugs.
No, he's not.

518
00:39:43,146 --> 00:39:45,614
Ecstasy?
No.

519
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:50,678
- Twice with Dan and Mike.
- You know what they cut that stuff with?

520
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:55,253
Apparently, colchicine.
Unless you ingested the colchicine
through your contact lens solution,

521
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:58,029
or skin cream
or some other drug you're lying about.

522
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:02,973
I don't know how it happened.
I don't care how it happened.
It happened. Start, uh--

523
00:40:03,046 --> 00:40:06,538
- Brandon.
- Lovely name.

524
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:10,782
Start Brandon on FAB fragments,
and get him some Tylenol
for the hair I pulled out.

525
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:13,019
And get some air in here.

526
00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:17,461
Make a note.
I should never doubt myself.

527
00:40:17,537 --> 00:40:21,200
I think you'll remember.
You know, it wouldn't hurt you
to be wrong every now and then.

528
00:40:21,276 --> 00:40:23,642
What, you don't care about
these people?

529
00:40:27,786 --> 00:40:32,120
The colchicine interferes with
the ability of the heart muscle
to contract,

530
00:40:32,194 --> 00:40:35,027
pumping blood,
lowering your blood pressure.

531
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:41,863
The antibodies we're giving you
should neutralize the colchicine,

532
00:40:43,545 --> 00:40:46,343
allowing your heart
to beat at its normal rate.

533
00:40:47,352 --> 00:40:50,685
When will you know?

534
00:40:50,758 --> 00:40:52,692
We know now.

535
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,692
Thank God.

536
00:40:56,768 --> 00:40:58,702
Mmm.

537
00:41:18,804 --> 00:41:22,740
Big weekend?
It's not for me.
I'm fully stocked.

538
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:27,271
- Cuddy got you doing inventory?
- Nope. Trying to solve that kid's case.

539
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:30,013
The gout medicine O.D.?
Yeah.

540
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:33,490
The fact that I know it's a gout
medicine O.D. would indicate
the case is already solved.

541
00:41:33,562 --> 00:41:35,496
Well, you'd be wrong.

542
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:40,400
What about the fact that
the kid is now-- I believe
the technical term is-- "not sick"?

543
00:41:40,473 --> 00:41:42,805
You know how many forms
of colchicine there are on the market?

544
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:45,345
- Stop it.
- Neither do I. But it's a lot.

545
00:41:45,414 --> 00:41:48,611
Pills, powders, liquids, I. V. fluids.

546
00:41:48,686 --> 00:41:52,850
Somewhere at a party, in his coffee,
up his nose, in his ear, this kid had some.

547
00:41:52,926 --> 00:41:54,826
You're not happy with
your Ecstasy theory?

548
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:57,228
- He said he used it twice.
- People lie.

549
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,495
- If you're gonna lie, it's--
- You know what? I'm not interested.

550
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:03,836
- Not curious?
- No. Because I'm well-adjusted.

551
00:42:03,911 --> 00:42:06,709
Right.

552
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,018
Temperature's normal.
I want cousin Sharon there.

553
00:42:12,091 --> 00:42:14,321
If we invite Sharon,
we have to invite all the cousins.

554
00:42:14,395 --> 00:42:17,592
So what? My side of the family
doesn't need anything.

555
00:42:22,074 --> 00:42:25,566
I don't suppose I could have
some of those cough pills, huh?
They're okay, right?

556
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:28,115
- Yes. You're doing great.
- You should invite Dr. House.

557
00:42:28,185 --> 00:42:31,052
- Will he come?
- No. But he'll send a gift.

558
00:42:31,123 --> 00:42:33,614
I'll make sure it's a good one.

559
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:37,356
There's a letter
on the back of these pills.

560
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:40,698
Your old pills
didn't have a letter on them?

561
00:42:40,772 --> 00:42:44,071
No. Round and yellow,
but no letter.

562
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:54,320
Well, these will help your cough.

563
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,161
Hey, you wanna go get some--
No.
