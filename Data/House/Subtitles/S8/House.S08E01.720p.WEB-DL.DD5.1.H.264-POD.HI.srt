Very interesting practice
you must've run.

351
00:19:25,337 --> 00:19:27,005
No need for tests.

352
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:28,640
No need for proof.

353
00:19:28,707 --> 00:19:30,708
<i>Where are you going?</i>

354
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:31,893
To the proof store.

355
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:39,517
You were right
about Nicole.

356
00:19:39,568 --> 00:19:43,220
About me not caring?
I thought so.

357
00:19:43,272 --> 00:19:46,357
It wasn't her mom.
It was her.

358
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:48,192
She doesn't wanna
talk to me.

359
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:50,227
Listen, I'm trying to
listen to your lungs,

360
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,996
not your self-pity.

361
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:55,366
Cancer can wait.

362
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,168
Hey, heading out
to the yard?

363
00:19:57,235 --> 00:19:58,402
Mm-hmm.

364
00:19:58,454 --> 00:20:01,289
You mind trying
to find me a cricket?

365
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:03,541
The ol' swap trick?

366
00:20:03,592 --> 00:20:06,377
You don't think that will
piss off your cellie even more

367
00:20:06,428 --> 00:20:08,129
when he figures
it's a different bug?

368
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:11,132
I'll dress 'em the same,
like in <i>Vertigo.</i>

369
00:20:11,216 --> 00:20:14,969
Well, I'll try, but they
spray so much pesticide

370
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:17,421
I'm surprised we're alive.

371
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:21,893
Good point.

372
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,114
Hey.
How's it coming?

373
00:20:26,198 --> 00:20:27,532
It ain't.

374
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,534
The confederates be giving
themselves spankin' new tats.

375
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:31,369
They putting a claim
on all of my Vicodin.

376
00:20:31,436 --> 00:20:32,937
Now, I love you and all,
my brother,

377
00:20:32,988 --> 00:20:34,605
but not as much
as I love my gang

378
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:36,791
of crazy, roided-out
Nazi bitches.

379
00:20:42,047 --> 00:20:44,365
<i>Turn to an inch</i>
<i>to the left.</i>

380
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,555
<i>Hear</i>
<i>the difference?</i>

381
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:51,956
Yeah!

382
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:53,641
It's called
an acoustical shadow.

383
00:20:53,726 --> 00:20:55,126
<i>It means</i>
<i>he's got a tumor.</i>

384
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:56,928
How did you find that
without a stethoscope?

385
00:20:56,979 --> 00:20:58,663
I didn't even know
you could do this!

386
00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:00,365
Start
the blood thinners.

387
00:21:00,432 --> 00:21:01,933
So I for sure
got lung cancer?

388
00:21:01,984 --> 00:21:02,984
- No.
- Yeah.

389
00:21:04,636 --> 00:21:05,937
<i>All you've proven</i>

390
00:21:05,988 --> 00:21:07,355
is there's an anomaly
in his chest.

391
00:21:07,439 --> 00:21:08,489
Which means
your initial diagnosis

392
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:09,640
could still be right.

393
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:11,292
Which apparently
really bugs you.

394
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:17,415
I could do
a clotting test.

395
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:20,985
That's...

396
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:23,588
That's a good idea.

397
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:24,922
<i>We're just gonna cut</i>
<i>your earlobe a bit</i>

398
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,258
<i>and check back</i>
<i>in two minutes.</i>

399
00:21:27,325 --> 00:21:29,877
If there's a little blood
bubbling up, that's normal.

400
00:21:29,962 --> 00:21:33,214
But if it's
completely clotted,

401
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:35,666
it may indicate cancer.

402
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:38,019
Okay? Ready?

403
00:21:59,408 --> 00:22:02,827
Are you really
leaving medicine?

404
00:22:02,878 --> 00:22:05,546
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

405
00:22:08,217 --> 00:22:09,550
You know, for someone

406
00:22:09,635 --> 00:22:12,386
who asks as many favors
as you do,

407
00:22:12,471 --> 00:22:14,205
you sure don't make
any effort

408
00:22:14,256 --> 00:22:15,923
to win me over.

409
00:22:19,812 --> 00:22:21,312
Before I went
to med school,

410
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:25,233
I thought about getting
a Ph.D. in physics.

411
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:27,351
You ever heard of
dark matter?

412
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:31,272
<i>The way galaxies rotate,</i>
<i>the motion of the Universe,</i>

413
00:22:31,356 --> 00:22:33,891
it means there's
six times more stuff

414
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:35,893
than we can detect.

415
00:22:35,944 --> 00:22:37,445
But it's theorized.

416
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:40,331
No one's ever proved
it exists.

417
00:22:40,398 --> 00:22:42,300
So you wanna
research it?

418
00:22:42,367 --> 00:22:43,451
<i>Why?</i>

419
00:22:43,535 --> 00:22:46,087
It's the greatest
mystery there is--

420
00:22:46,171 --> 00:22:47,972
the theory
of everything.

421
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,208
And completely divorced
from humanity.

422
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:52,376
Well,
me and humanity,

423
00:22:52,427 --> 00:22:54,295
we got together
too young.

424
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:58,349
Tsk.
You have a gift.

425
00:22:58,417 --> 00:23:01,519
<i>There is something</i>
<i>in this world</i>

426
00:23:01,586 --> 00:23:03,654
you are
undeniably great at.

427
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:05,723
<i>You can read people.</i>

428
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:08,609
<i>You--</i>
<i>you understand them.</i>

429
00:23:08,694 --> 00:23:10,661
You gotta go back
to medicine.

430
00:23:12,781 --> 00:23:15,700
Well, if that gift is related
to what brought me here,

431
00:23:15,767 --> 00:23:19,337
you'll understand if I wanna
check the returns policy.

432
00:23:19,404 --> 00:23:20,771
<i>Hey!</i>

433
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:23,491
Is this supposed
to happen?

434
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:29,664
Cool.

435
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:46,260
Jiminy didn't chirp much
last night.

436
00:23:46,328 --> 00:23:49,764
If it's a disease,
then he's six inches under.

437
00:23:49,831 --> 00:23:53,301
But this could also
be pesticide poisoning...

438
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:57,638
Which bicarbonate of soda
has been used to treat.

439
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:00,308
See?

440
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:03,561
Just so much
and no more.

441
00:24:12,955 --> 00:24:15,456
Mm...

442
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,632
This is where
you say "thank you."

443
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,386
Or I say thank you

444
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:30,571
for not killing me.

445
00:24:35,594 --> 00:24:37,762
Thank you.

447
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:02,403
Hey.

448
00:25:02,454 --> 00:25:05,239
The X-ray didn't show
any tumors.

449
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:07,908
The acoustical shadow
was just a lipoma.

450
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,094
I'm thinking--
you all right?

451
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:11,912
I'm fine.

452
00:25:11,964 --> 00:25:13,464
Ibuprofen?

453
00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:15,266
That's not gonna help.

454
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,727
You can look
at the patient file

455
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:28,196
if you want.

456
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:30,264
You trust me?

457
00:25:30,315 --> 00:25:32,099
Any reason I shouldn't?

458
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:34,118
You're really not good
at reading people, are you?

459
00:25:34,203 --> 00:25:35,269
Or buildings.

460
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,871
People are complicated.

461
00:25:36,938 --> 00:25:38,656
And people change.

462
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,107
Not that much
to the first,

463
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,775
and not at all
to the second.

464
00:25:41,827 --> 00:25:43,327
But if it'll
get me the file...

465
00:25:43,412 --> 00:25:45,179
If we add "clotting disorder"
to the symptoms,

466
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:46,447
it's gotta be a toxin.

467
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:48,115
This guy's the only one
with symptoms.

468
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,750
It's either gotta be his cell
or his work station.

469
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:50,951
The laundry room.

470
00:25:51,003 --> 00:25:53,671
So maybe a solvent
or detergent?

471
00:25:53,755 --> 00:25:57,091
Can you get me an escort
to gather samples?

472
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:58,759

00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:42,129
<i>They're gonna charge you</i>
<i>with extra crimes.</i>

707
00:40:42,196 --> 00:40:44,531
You'll be here
six more months, minimum!

708
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:47,334
Sorry. Distracted.
You were saying?

709
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:48,919
<i>I checked your file.</i>
<i>You didn't have a bad lawyer.</i>

710
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:50,671
You had no lawyer.

711
00:40:50,722 --> 00:40:52,472
<i>You took the first deal</i>
<i>they offered you,</i>

712
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,842
because you wanted
to punish yourself.

713
00:40:54,893 --> 00:40:56,343
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>getting beaten up,</i>

714
00:40:56,394 --> 00:40:58,478
you think saving this one guy
will wipe your slate clean?

715
00:40:58,546 --> 00:40:59,930
No.

716
00:41:00,014 --> 00:41:01,348
Then why are you
doing this?

717
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:02,733
'Cause I have a gift.

718
00:41:03,985 --> 00:41:05,736
Once you drink this,

719
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,654
should get an attack
almost immediately.

720
00:41:07,722 --> 00:41:08,989
<i>That is, if I'm right.</i>

721
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:10,991
<i>Just bought yourself</i>
<i>months in solitary.</i>

722
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:12,109
Was it really worth it?

723
00:41:12,193 --> 00:41:14,862
If I'm wrong, no,
it wasn't.

724
00:41:14,913 --> 00:41:16,496
<i>(Sykes)</i>
<i>No! No! No! Get the cup!</i>

725
00:41:16,564 --> 00:41:17,614
<i>Get the cup!</i>

726
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:18,949
Just drink it!
Drink it!

727
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,067
<i>(Sykes)</i>
<i>No! Grab the cup!</i>

728
00:41:23,087 --> 00:41:24,922
<i>(Hsueh)</i>
<i>Hands behind your back.</i>

729
00:41:25,006 --> 00:41:27,541
What were you
thinking?

730
00:41:27,592 --> 00:41:31,628
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I--I was scared.</i>

731
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:41,755
No!

732
00:41:41,806 --> 00:41:42,940
<i>You're fired.</i>

733
00:41:43,024 --> 00:41:44,975
You're beyond fired.

734
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:47,945
You're completely
unhireable anywhere.

735
00:41:48,029 --> 00:41:49,429
You understand that?

736
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,199
Yes.

737
00:41:52,266 --> 00:41:54,368
Now shut up and let's see
if he has an attack.

738
00:42:13,621 --> 00:42:16,957
<i>(House) Come on, just</i>
<i>a little more time.</i>

739
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:23,964
<i>(Sykes)</i>
<i>Get him out of here.</i>

00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:42,349
