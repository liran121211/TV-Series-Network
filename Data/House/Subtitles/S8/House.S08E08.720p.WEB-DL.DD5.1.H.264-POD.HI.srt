about why you don't like
working with me?

178
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:05,079
There's nothing to talk about.

179
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:06,914
House liked poking ant hills

180
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:08,482
with a stick
when he was a kid,

181
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,150
<i>and now he wants</i>
<i>to do the same with us.</i>

182
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:12,452
House is an ass,
but he's an intuitive ass.

183
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,421
He obviously noticed something.

184
00:07:14,489 --> 00:07:17,090
Yeah, the fact
that we work well together.

185
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:21,127
He thrives on conflict and is
looking for someone to torment.

186
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:22,729
Don't let it be us.

187

<i>(Olivia) I don't see</i>
<i>how that's possible.</i>

188
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:31,105
Tommy's the most popular guy
in his office.

189
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:33,007
He's even had defendants
thank him

190
00:07:33,074 --> 00:07:35,242
after they were sentenced.
Why would they thank him?

191
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,111
Because he doesn't treat them
like scum.

192
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:39,080
He makes them feel
like he's helping

193
00:07:39,148 --> 00:07:40,782
by offering a plea
or even just by letting them

194
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,585
pay their debt
and clear their conscience.

195
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:44,487
And even if someone wanted
to poison him,

196
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:46,055
I don't see
how they would do it.

197
00:07:46,123 --> 00:07:49,492
He never eats or drinks anything
that we haven't made at home.

198
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,627
Wait.
You mean literally?

199
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:52,595
Like, not even a bottle
of water?

200
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:53,830
No.

201
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:56,599
So he was obviously
afraid of something.

202
00:07:56,667 --> 00:07:59,436
Yeah, rats,
mice, cockroaches.

My first job out of law school

204
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,041
was at the health department.

If you'd have seen
some of the kitchens

206
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,110
or the processing plants
I have,

207
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:08,646
you'd cook
all your own food too.

any strange letters

210
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:13,884

recently?

211
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,986
No.

212
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:19,622
You also wouldn't have
to be at work.

213
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,156
We've got two young kids.

214
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:22,925
There's definitely
no poisons

215
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:24,560
I could have accidentally
been exposed to at home.

216
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:29,030
What if it wasn't an accident?

217
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:30,932
How are things
between you and your wife?

218
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:32,400
[Laughs]

219
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:35,202

if I think

220
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,870
my wife is trying
to kill me?

221
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:39,939
Yes, I am.

222
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:42,875
Absolutely not.

223
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:44,143
This is coming
from a man

224

whose eyes
are wide open.

225
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:48,280

I can assure you...

229
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:53,453
I love my husband,

230
00:08:53,521 --> 00:08:56,056
and I would not ever
even for a second

231
00:08:56,124 --> 00:08:58,026

No, there's not even a bottle

237
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:09,004
Maybe we should look again.

Maybe we should leave
before the police get here.

239
00:09:12,108 --> 00:09:13,608
Well, even if a neighbor
saw us break in

240

unless they said we were armed,

00:14:08,983 --> 00:14:12,586
Again, given what I've seen
at Bloomingdale's...

354
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:14,822
Don't let House get
to you.

355
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,990
It's all of you.

356
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:17,392
I feel like you don't
respect me.

357
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,194
Chase certainly
doesn't try to hide it.

358
00:14:19,261 --> 00:14:20,895
Chase respects you.
He's just more comfortable

359
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:22,831
working with me
because he's known me longer.

360
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:24,366
And I'm not just saying that
because you own a gun.

361
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:26,968
I don't own a gun.

362
00:14:27,036 --> 00:14:29,337
I've thought about it,
but I'd probably end up shooting

363
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:31,405
someone in my own family,
like when my brother

364
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:33,641
tosses his toenail clippings
behind the couch.

365
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,076
What about you?

366
00:14:36,144 --> 00:14:38,446
If anarchy breaks out,

367
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:40,447
I plan to do
what my ancestors have done

368
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:43,517
throughout the ages--run.

369
00:14:43,585 --> 00:14:45,285
<i>(Foreman)</i>
<i>Sounds like a good plan.</i>

370
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:47,755
You got a moment?

371
00:14:50,092 --> 00:14:52,293
Stop telling the nurses
I'm looking for a girlfriend.

372
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,794
What makes you--

373
00:14:53,862 --> 00:14:55,495
Two lunch offers
and a box of cupcakes

374
00:14:55,563 --> 00:14:56,930
since this morning.

375
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:58,265
So a few people
are nice to you,

376
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,701
and your first thought is,
"Hmm, this seems strange"?

377
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:02,970
I haven't even had enough time
to eat my own lunch,

378
00:15:03,037 --> 00:15:06,006
much less run around trying
to recruit nurses for yours.

379
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:07,507
So can I get back to work?

380
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,411
You're lying,
aren't you?

381
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,813
It's for his own good.

382
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:17,315
He's not paranoid.
He's just stupid.

383
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,850
Well, shouldn't you put yourself
in that group?

384
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:21,619
You own a gun.

385
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:26,424
Our patient doesn't own a gun.
He owns an arsenal.

386
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,159
And I don't own a gun.

387
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,529
Yes, you do.

388
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,597
And you're a felon,
so you'll end up back in jail--

389
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:35,100
That is actually not one
of the many reasons

390
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,602
that I don't own a gun.

391
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,238
Why would I need a gun?

392
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,874
The only thing I own
worth protecting

393
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,876
a thief would need a crane
to get out of my apartment.

394
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:44,411
You don't own anything
you need.

395
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:45,945
You own things you want.

396
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:47,413
And you're definitely the type
who'd want a gun.

397
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:49,282
You like anything dangerous--

398
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,851
monster trucks,
motorcycles, fireworks.

399
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,586
Everyone loves fireworks.

400
00:15:53,654 --> 00:15:56,055
Watching them,
not making them.

401
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,190
I'm telling the truth.

402
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,158
I stand corrected.

403
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,563
If you believe me,
then this issue will be resolved

404
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,164
with no further action
necessary.

405
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:09,033
Absolutely.

406
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,635
It's not resolved,
is it?

407
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:13,905
Not even close.

408
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,606
[Door opens]

409
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:16,808
It's not cocaine.

410
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:18,376
Hair samples were clean.

411
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,744
It's not looking good
for Fahr's either.

412
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,713
I'm not seeing
any calcifications.

413
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:22,747
You sure?

414
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,949
They can be pretty hard
to detect

415
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,284
in people under 50.

416
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,686
- See?
- What?

417
00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,688
We all disagree
all the time.

418
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,157
It's not just me
and Park.

419
00:16:31,225 --> 00:16:33,359
Nice try,

420
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,095
but I'm not getting
in the middle.

421
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:37,831
So why didn't you want
to go with her this morning?

422
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,433
She's weird.

423
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:41,102
She's not weird.
She's a good doctor.

424
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,771
Most good doctors are weird.
Look at House.

425
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,806
Am I weird?

426
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:48,242
Yeah, but you're hot,
so it's easier to put up with.

427
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:54,247
You're completely normal
and a pleasure to deal with.

428
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:56,182
You're weird.

429
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,950
In a good way?

430
00:16:58,018 --> 00:17:00,753
Maybe we should just concentrate
on the medicine.

431
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,355
You own any guns?

432
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,690
That's not medicine.

433
00:17:04,758 --> 00:17:06,826
But it's related to medicine.
Kind of.

434
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:08,427
What do you think?

435
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,498
Yeah,
but not for protection.

436
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:14,667
Despite what the media
would have us believe,

437
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,269
you think we live
in a very safe world.

438
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:18,839
You just think
they're fun.

439
00:17:18,906 --> 00:17:21,208
How did you know?

440
00:17:21,276 --> 00:17:22,576
Working in prison,
you learned criminals

441
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:24,045
rarely target
random strangers,

442
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:26,047
and you've got more money
than you know what to do with,

443
00:17:26,115 --> 00:17:29,050
so anything that seems different
and fun's worth trying.

444
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:30,384
And you?

445
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:32,220

448
00:17:37,226 --> 00:17:38,793
But they're so cute.

449
00:17:38,861 --> 00:17:40,729
They're also delicious.

Totally.

00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:47,368
There's no calcification.

453
00:17:47,436 --> 00:17:50,171
Looks like we're both wrong.

454
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:52,173
You don't need to stay.

455
00:17:52,241 --> 00:17:54,141

until the morning.

456

00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:59,947

You have a spare tire
in your car, right?

That's what those guns are.

I mean, I hope to God
I never have to use one.

He also spiked
a fever overnight.

478
00:18:58,129 --> 00:18:59,797
It could be TB.

Yeah. It's med-speak

Systemic sclerosis can cause
lower extremity ulcers.

pretty far along

was just a few days ago.

at least a year ago.

in that home.

Oh, please don't.

that I can't live my life
