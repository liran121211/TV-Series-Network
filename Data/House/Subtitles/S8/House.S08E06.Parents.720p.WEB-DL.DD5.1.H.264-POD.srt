1
00:00:02,068 --> 00:00:03,174
Okay, boys and girls.

2
00:00:04,288 --> 00:00:05,256
Guess what kind of animal

3
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,361
wacky Benny's making now?

4
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:10,135
<i>Give you a big hint.</i>

5
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:14,886
<i>Bor-ing.</i>

6
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:19,941
Is it a dead animal?

7
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,023
I say we put him out of his misery

8
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,629
and bring out Emma's cake.

9
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:27,067
He's so new to this.

10
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:29,375
<i>How's he gonna learn if we stop his act?</i>

11
00:00:29,375 --> 00:00:30,847
You're a sucky clown.

12
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:34,428
And you're a super-duper audience.

13
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:40,217
Hey, that is not okay.

14
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:41,791
Hey, keep your hands off my son.

15
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,496
Tell him to keep his hand off me.

16
00:00:53,366 --> 00:00:55,538
I can't move my arm or leg.

17
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:31,639
So how does a completely healthy
teenager have a mini-stroke?

18
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:34,215
<i>Head CT and cerebral angiogram are normal.</i>

19
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:36,121
Clotting parameters are normal.

20
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:37,459
You're forgetting the wrinkly clump

21
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:39,900
in the middle of his shirt.

22
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,911
Thought we'd diagnose the
middle-aged clown first.

23
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:44,917
It's probably from my seat belt.

24
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:46,188
<i>Wrinkle pattern's too varied.</i>

25
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:48,095
It looks like someone
shoved you or grabbed you.

26
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:49,164
Probably from the diaper bag.

27
00:01:49,164 --> 00:01:50,603
If the patient's using drugs,

28
00:01:50,603 --> 00:01:52,676
cocaine could have caused an
arterial spasm in his brain.

29
00:01:52,676 --> 00:01:54,149
The tox screen was clean.

30
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,327
I'm gonna say it was the
ex-girlfriend you cheated on,

31
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:59,535
not the ex-wife you cheated with.

32
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:01,041
If the latter was prone to violence,

33
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:04,520
you'd have been scattered in
various dumpsters years ago.

34
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:08,332
Seriously?

35
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:10,607
No one else wants to talk about the patient?

36
00:02:10,607 --> 00:02:13,685
New office furniture. Meaty topic.

37
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:15,090
What's the action on the ex-wife?

38
00:02:16,663 --> 00:02:19,172
It was Rachel's boyfriend Phil.

39
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,643
His company's moving him back to Portland.

40
00:02:20,643 --> 00:02:23,086
He wants me to change my visitation order

41
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:24,959
so he can ask Rachel and my daughter

42
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,597
to move out west with him.

43
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:27,835
<i>Things got a little heated.</i>

44
00:02:29,944 --> 00:02:31,916
The patient was punched in the groin.

45
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:35,361
Could have triggered a massive
sympathetic discharge.

46
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:36,465
Carotid duplex is normal.

47
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:38,773
Who's better qualified to be the daddy?

48
00:02:38,773 --> 00:02:41,784
The guy who spilled a
little DNA in her gene pool

49
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:43,356
or the guy who's gonna
be there day and night

50
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:44,795
to pass on important values

51
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:48,006
like not shtupping mommy after the divorce?

52
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:49,645
I am her daddy.

53
00:02:49,645 --> 00:02:51,652
She's staying here.

54
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:52,823
<i>House has a point.</i>

55
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:54,428
A couple nights a week with each kid

56
00:02:54,428 --> 00:02:55,734
may make you feel better.

57
00:02:55,734 --> 00:02:57,673
Doesn't replace two
'round-the-clock parents.

58
00:02:57,673 --> 00:03:00,048
'Round-the-clock or not,
parenting's an impossible job.

59
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:02,290
No way not to mess it up.

60
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,029
Why shouldn't Taub be the one to do it?

61
00:03:04,029 --> 00:03:06,038
<i>Thank you. Makes sense.</i>

62
00:03:06,038 --> 00:03:08,881
Park's tiger mom and dad
were so insufferable,

63
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:11,154
<i>she has to measure their affection in hours.</i>

64
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:13,730
Chase's careerist dad and alcoholic mom

65
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,039
<i>were so indifferent,
he has to believe it's a wash.</i>

66
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,243
<i>Your turn.</i>

67
00:03:17,243 --> 00:03:18,647
What did your screwed-up parents do

68
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:21,424
to screw up your view of parenting?

69
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:23,062
They were good parents.

70
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:24,701
That's an oxymoron.

71
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:27,679
Chase is right. All parents
screw up all children.

72
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,852
He's also dreamy, but it's not relevant now.

73
00:03:29,852 --> 00:03:31,759
<i>So all parents screw up all children,</i>

74
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,030
but it makes some huge difference

75
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,506
if I keep my daughter here or let her move?

76
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,078
<i>Endocarditis.</i>

77
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:38,650
<i>Flipped a piece of vegetation
into his brain,</i>

78
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,457
which could have broken
up before the angiogram.

79
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:43,634
Transesophageal echo to confirm.

80
00:03:43,634 --> 00:03:46,009
Screwed up is your best case.

81
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:48,551
Bouncing between a
philandering workaholic dad

82
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,859
and an embittered, sexually betrayed mom,

83
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:54,405
it's gonna lead to screwed-up squared.

84
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,018
Is endocarditis treatable?

85
00:03:58,018 --> 00:04:01,364
Very. The echo will show us any
growths on his heart valve.

86
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:03,103
<i>Most likely meds will be enough.</i>

87
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:04,775
<i>He won't even need surgery.</i>

88
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:06,448
<i>He's just taken up performing</i>

89
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:08,789
and it's very stressful for him.

90
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,162
Could that have caused this?

91
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:12,269
It's not stressful. I have fun.

92
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,506
Stress wouldn't be relevant,

93
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:15,078
but anything that increases his adrenalin

94
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:17,654
could have made it worse.

95
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:18,991
Maybe we find you a new hobby,

96
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:20,295
one you're a little better at.

97
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:24,844
I'm gonna get better at it,
and it's not a hobby.

98
00:04:24,844 --> 00:04:28,690
I-I think I want to get a job
working as a circus clown,

99
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,497
<i>making people laugh.</i>

100
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,682
Ben, I-I don't think that's a good idea.

101
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:36,752
It was good enough for my dad.

102
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,963
You're a, uh--

103
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,071
No, his biological father.

104
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:44,346
Could his dad's melanoma be a factor here?

105
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:46,319
That wouldn't be related.

106
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,059
Ben, you barely knew him.

107
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:50,634
<i>You're such a smart kid.</i>

108
00:04:50,634 --> 00:04:51,972
You could aim a lot higher

109
00:04:51,972 --> 00:04:54,581
than face paint and seltzer bottles.

110
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:00,000
I need treatment for my Type 2 diabetes.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,549
There is absolutely no part
of that sentence that is true.

112
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:06,154
I've been experiencing weight gain, fatigue,

113
00:05:06,154 --> 00:05:07,359
and sluggishness.

114
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:10,302
Weight loss is a symptom of diabetes.

115
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:11,875
<i>Fatigue is a symptom</i>

116
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,849
of thinking you have a disease
you don't actually have,

117
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:16,089
and sluggishness is a synonym of fatigue.

118
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:18,499
I need Insulin. I know it.

119
00:05:18,499 --> 00:05:19,803
<i>Much as I'd like to kill you</i>

120
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:21,776
by dangerously lowering your blood sugar,

121
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:23,649
murder violates my parole.

122
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:25,322
That bloodwork is week's old.

123
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:26,594
Test me again.

124
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:29,403
I am the test. The test is negative.

125
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:34,654
The test also thinks you're
a giant pain in the ass.

126
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:36,996
That last insult was your cue to leave.

127
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:40,376
Test me.

128
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:45,694
Fine. Wait right here.

129
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:47,098
Thank you.

130
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:51,045
Sleep study.

131
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:52,484
Please make sure he's not disturbed

132
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:54,424
for the next eight hours.

133
00:05:54,424 --> 00:05:56,331
We need to talk about Saturday night.

134
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:59,141
No, no, no, no, no.

135
00:05:59,141 --> 00:06:02,652
Historians will talk of
Saturday night, not us.

136
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:03,857
The legendary night

137
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:06,833
on which we watch Santos shatter Rubio's jaw

138
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,707
and you epically pay me $50.

139
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:10,980
I have a chance to really watch it.

140
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,523
A patient of mine has a pair
of tickets he can't use,

141
00:06:13,523 --> 00:06:18,173
and obviously you're under
house and office arrest.

142
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:20,747
I just wanted to make sure you were cool

143
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,118
if I go to Atlantic City without you.

144
00:06:22,118 --> 00:06:23,991
Uh, no, thanks.

145
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,266
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to decline your invitation

146
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,741
to not spend Saturday night with you.

147
00:06:28,741 --> 00:06:30,782
These are ringside seats.

148
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:32,990
Cameras are ringside too.

149
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,164
If you want, I could sweat and spit

150
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:37,038
and bleed on you from time to time.

151
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,280
I'd take you if I could.

152
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,852
Well, I'd take me if either of us could.

153
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:42,858
See what a tough spot I'm in?

154
00:06:42,858 --> 00:06:44,564
I'm going to that fight.

155
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:49,982
All right, I'll take the other ticket.

156
00:06:49,982 --> 00:06:52,123
Let me worry about logistics.

157
00:07:01,724 --> 00:07:02,927
Patient's heart valves are normal.

158
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,700
It's not endocarditis.

159
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,670
But he has a thickened pericardium,

160
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,741
which makes no sense.

161
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,446
He has a heart problem

162
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:10,888
but not one that could
have caused his T.I.A.

163
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,862
Syphilitic vasculitis
would explain the T.I.A.

164
00:07:12,862 --> 00:07:14,033
and the pericardial inflammation.

165
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,705
<i>Syph test was negative.</i>

166
00:07:15,705 --> 00:07:17,711
Plus, the kid's never been sexually active.

167
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:19,485
Yeah, I got that from the line in his chart

168
00:07:19,485 --> 00:07:20,956
that says "birthday clown."

169
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,528
His late father was a circus clown.

170
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,401
Histoplasmosis?

171
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:25,773
<i>He's not immuno-compromised.</i>

172
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:27,613
And I assume you added
that irrelevant tidbit

173
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,720
<i>because you're moved by the
son's idiotic tribute</i>

174
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,697
and think it justifies keeping
your daughter in New Jersey.

175
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:34,269
What if he has a heightened immune system?

176
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:36,143
I mentioned it because...

177
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:39,688
Take your time.

178
00:07:39,688 --> 00:07:42,198
We'll continue with the medicine.

179
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,205
Sjogren's could have given
him chronic pericarditis

180
00:07:44,205 --> 00:07:45,208
<i>and cerebral arteritis.</i>

181
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,480
Sjogren's it is.

182
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,018
IV immunosuppressants to treat.

183
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:51,029
Anything?

184
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:55,411
<i>This will calm your immune system.</i>

185
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:58,756
Should be out of here within the week.

186
00:07:58,756 --> 00:08:00,965
My mom will be happy to hear that.

187
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:03,574
I've got an internship
that starts in three weeks.

188
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:06,484
I take it it's not at a
place with a big top.

189
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:10,566
It's at my stepdad's law office.

190
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:13,777
I know I'm not any good
at being a clown yet,

191
00:08:13,777 --> 00:08:17,791
but when I do get a laugh

192
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,770
and see those kids' eyes light up,

193
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:23,646
that's how my dad made
me feel when I was a kid.

194
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:26,724
You need to hang on to that.

195
00:08:26,724 --> 00:08:27,726
Heh.

196
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,109
My mom says he was a loving father

197
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:36,626
but always broke and always on the road.

198
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:39,369
It's just a stupid way to make a living.

199
00:08:39,369 --> 00:08:44,919
You're 16. Plenty of time to make money.

200
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,830
Wanting to build a connection with your dad

201
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,339
<i>and pass on some of the joy
that he gave you,</i>

202
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:52,847
that's not stupid at all.

203
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:56,929
Ooh. I got it.

204
00:09:02,483 --> 00:09:06,764
Is, uh, is this because of the medication?

205
00:09:06,764 --> 00:09:08,638
Is it normal?

206
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:17,067
It's not normal, and it's not Sjogren's.

207
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,037
T.I.A., thickened pericardium,

208
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:29,853
and now he's bleeding
from his nose and mouth.

209
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,727
What are you doing with her?

210
00:09:31,727 --> 00:09:32,449
"Her"?

211
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,718
Surely this bundle of
fun has an actual name.

212
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,267
It's Sophie.

213
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:44,772
Both your kids are named--

214
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:47,314
she's Sophie. The other one's Sophia.

215
00:09:47,314 --> 00:09:48,551
It's different enough.

216
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:49,622
<i>They actually have</i>

217
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,232
two completely different derivations.

218
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:54,874
No, they don't.

219
00:09:54,874 --> 00:09:57,316
I wasn't in a strong negotiating position.

220
00:09:57,316 --> 00:09:58,320
Why is she here?

221
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,825
Ruby dropped her off.

222
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,363
Seemed pretty upset.

223
00:10:01,363 --> 00:10:03,972
Apparently someone forgot
that it was daddy's night.

224
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:05,210
<i>She wasn't even gonna leave her</i>

225
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,950
until I said that I was
letting you off early.

226
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,090
Damn it. I just started back on the team.

227
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,328
My schedule's a mess.

228
00:10:10,328 --> 00:10:12,033
If your own kids are a scheduling item,

229
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:14,075
maybe you should let one of them move.

230
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:15,981
Patient has low platelets.

231
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:16,985
Makes me think D.I.C.

232
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:19,526
<i>She doesn't seem to like that idea.</i>

233
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:21,366
You're right.

234
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:23,540
He has no schistocytes in his smear.

235
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,781
He also has a low red count.

236
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:28,424
What if it's a retroperitoneal bleed?

237
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:29,862
No Grey-Turner's sign.

238
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,303
She wasn't fussing like
that when I was holding her.

239
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:34,344
<i>Maybe she likes the sound of my voice,</i>

240
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:39,294
which is weird because I have
no genetic connection to her.

241
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:42,872
Could it be she doesn't know the difference?

242
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:44,378
So many children of your own.

243
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:45,582
No wonder you have such insight

244
00:10:45,582 --> 00:10:46,686
into my relationship with my babies.

245
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:47,990
<i>Good point.</i>

246
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,598
How could I comprehend
that you're too despised

247
00:10:50,598 --> 00:10:52,438
to keep them from having the same name,

248
00:10:52,438 --> 00:10:54,245
<i>too overwhelmed to remember
your own calendar,</i>

249
00:10:54,245 --> 00:10:55,917
<i>and too vain to admit that at this stage,</i>

250
00:10:55,917 --> 00:10:59,763
you don't matter to either baby.

251
00:10:59,763 --> 00:11:01,537
Low white count suggests infection.

252
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:04,481
What if you're all right?

253
00:11:04,481 --> 00:11:05,953
<i>Low platelets plus low red count</i>

254
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:07,727
<i>plus low white count equals--</i>

255
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:08,896
aplastic anemia.

256
00:11:08,896 --> 00:11:11,740
Kid needs a bone marrow transplant.

257
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,513
Everyone except Adams,

258
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:16,155
transfuse his platelets
till you find a match.

259
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:26,458
You started college a semester late

260
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,200
<i>because you left high school a semester late</i>

261
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,876
because you had five incompletes

262
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:33,949
in your junior year.

263
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:35,655
And you're offering one bad semester

264
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:37,461
as proof that my parents screwed me up?

265
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:40,003
Did okay before that.
Straight as after that.

266
00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:41,274
I went through a rebellious phase.

267
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:42,411
Don't tell me.

268
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:45,154
Mom and dad were at each other's throats

269
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:48,967
and the academic crisis was a cry for help.

270
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:52,446
Sorry to mess with your world view,

271
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,320
but I'm not messed up,

272
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,293
so my parents couldn't have messed me up.

273
00:11:57,766 --> 00:12:01,178
Mom's HLA is only a 3/6 match.

274
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,285
Maternal grandmother's worse than that.

275
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:04,757
Where did you unload the baby?

276
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,363
Maternity ward. Shut up.

277
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:09,372
You realize you're making
House's argument for him.

278
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:11,614
The part where he said any
parent who uses day care

279
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:13,587
should ship their child across the country?

280
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:15,828
No, the part where he said
that baby doesn't need you.

281
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:17,634
<i>You've only got her a couple days a week</i>

282
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:19,842
and most of that's spent with
a rotating cast of nurses.

283
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:21,179
That's how daddy likes
to spend his time too.

284
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,651
Shut up.

285
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:23,888
First cousin's also a whiff.

286
00:12:23,888 --> 00:12:25,828
So much for genetics mattering.

287
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,702
I'll try the marrow registry.

288
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:33,187
<i>Dr. Park is searching the registry.</i>

289
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,396
<i>Transfusing his platelets will keep
him healthy while we wait.</i>

290
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,738
Are you sure there's no one on
the father's side of the family?

291
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:40,246
If one of them's a match,
that'd speed things up a lot.

292
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:42,722
His parents died young.

293
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:44,027
He was an only child.

294
00:12:44,027 --> 00:12:45,967
There's no living relatives that I know of.

295
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:47,373
Something will turn up soon.

296
00:12:47,373 --> 00:12:49,213
How soon is soon?
Will he miss a lot of school?

297
00:12:49,213 --> 00:12:50,985
I'm actually thinking
of just getting my GED.

298
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:55,201
How do you expect to get
into a good college?

299
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:58,679
I'm gonna take classes on magic and juggling

300
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,951
and try to make a go of this.

301
00:12:59,951 --> 00:13:01,087
Ben, you keep your grades up, you can do

302
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:02,426
anything in the world.

303
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:05,571
Like what? Work in some boring office?

304
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:07,110
<i>I mean, do you think my father</i>

305
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,380
would have done that for ten minutes?

306
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,818
You don't remember your father.
You don't know--

307
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:12,695
I want to build a connection with him,

308
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:19,251
pass on some of the--
the joy that he gave me.

309
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:22,630
My, uh, my back hurts. Uh...

310
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:27,780
His BP is dropping.

311
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,054
<i>We think we've dealt with all
the liability issues.</i>

312
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:35,306
I'm in a meeting.

313
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:36,810
Sorry.

314
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,319
Since you paged me,
I didn't want to keep you waiting.

315
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,860
Yeah, I paged you, which means you're next.

316
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,402
That's cool. I'll wait.

317
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:45,807
That's a good start.

318
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:48,015
Let's go through it point by point.

319
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:50,090
First up...

320
00:13:54,238 --> 00:13:56,144
I'll call you back.

321
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,992
Just got this.

322
00:13:59,992 --> 00:14:02,333
The American Association of Rheumatology

323
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:05,010
wants you to speak, 9:00, Saturday,

324
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,314
in Atlantic City.

325
00:14:06,314 --> 00:14:10,227
Dr. Neusinger canceled on
them at the last minute.

326
00:14:10,227 --> 00:14:13,003
Hmm. I hate conferences.

327
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:17,050
This is a big one,
and it's the premium slot.

328
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,923
I'd like you to do it.

329
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:20,963
I'll clear it with your parole officer.

330
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:23,405
What do I need to do for you?

331
00:14:26,885 --> 00:14:30,062
Halve the clinic hours
that you recently doubled

332
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:34,110
and double the hooker budget
that you recently halved.

333
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,422
I think you refer to it as petty cash.

334
00:14:37,422 --> 00:14:38,675
Fine.

335
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,544
Just one thing.

336
00:14:43,544 --> 00:14:45,985
I'm gonna ask them to put
you on in the morning.

337
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,358
We're doing them a favor.

338
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,629
Why should you have to spend the night?

339
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:52,643
You said that 9:00 was the premium slot.

340
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:54,984
I mean, I want to feel like
I've earned my hookers.

341
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:56,924
The place'll be a madhouse,

342
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:59,633
especially since it's two
miles from the Rubio fight

343
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:02,375
at the exact same time.

344
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,747
Nice try.

345
00:15:03,747 --> 00:15:05,754
You called up, pretended to be Neusinger,

346
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:07,960
cancelled, and suggested
yourself as a replacement.

347
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,938
You go to that fight, you go to prison.

348
00:15:10,938 --> 00:15:13,748
But that'd be redundant,
when I have an angry black guy

349
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,957
waiting for me to drop the soap right here.

350
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,733
Better go do some of those
clinic hours I recently doubled.

351
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:27,464
Test my urine.

352
00:15:27,464 --> 00:15:29,404
Looks like I was wrong about my diagnosis.

353
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:31,177
Yeah. I have diabetes.

354
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:33,753
No, but you're not a hypochondriac

355
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:36,128
or you would have imagined some new disease

356
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:37,332
after I shot down the first one.

357
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:38,805
So whose urine is that?

358
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,544
Diabetic girlfriend
without health insurance?

359
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:43,455
It's not a scam. I'm sick.

360
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:44,826
Now I have swollen ankles.

361
00:15:44,826 --> 00:15:46,967
The medical term is cankles.

362
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:48,806
Is there some black market in Insulin

363
00:15:48,806 --> 00:15:49,777
that I don't know about?

364
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:51,181
It's in my genes.

365
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:53,121
My old man got diabetes at 50.

366
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:54,192
My older brother got it at 50.

367
00:15:54,192 --> 00:15:55,798
I just turned 50.

368
00:15:55,798 --> 00:15:58,206
Well, it's a great argument
if diabetes was a gold watch.

369
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:00,447
I got sciatica, like my dad.

370
00:16:00,447 --> 00:16:03,156
Class-four hemorrhoids, like him.

371
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:04,595
I need to get a jump on this thing.

372
00:16:06,469 --> 00:16:09,412
We had to stop the transfusion.

373
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:11,720
Patient's having an allergic
reaction to donor platelets.

374
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,191
No one in mom's family's a match,

375
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:15,366
and as far as she knows,
dad has no living relatives.

376
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:17,941
<i>It's been years since he died.</i>

377
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:28,244
If the kid's dad died young of melanoma,

378
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:30,719
<i>how come the overprotective mom</i>

379
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,726
never took him to a dermatologist?

380
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:33,762
Are you gonna test my urine or what?

381
00:16:48,481 --> 00:16:50,019
Not diabetes.

382
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:52,528
Use cross-matched platelets.

383
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:53,698
Try to find the patient some blood

384
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:55,203
that's closer to his own.

385
00:16:55,203 --> 00:16:58,013
<i>And get the real story on clown,
senior's death.</i>

386
00:16:58,013 --> 00:16:59,619
Mom's hiding something.

387
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,492
It's a good bet that
it's medically relevant.

388
00:17:04,002 --> 00:17:05,205
Apple juice.

389
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:08,483
Easiest way to fake a spike in blood sugar.

390
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,304
His family history of melanoma

391
00:17:14,304 --> 00:17:17,615
may have affected his cellular outlook.

392
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:19,220
If we had more data

393
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,362
on the exact type of
melanoma his father had--

394
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:27,517
Otherwise, we might not be
able to find a marrow match.

395
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:29,959
He never had melanoma.

396
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:30,896
How did he die?

397
00:17:33,172 --> 00:17:34,141
He didn't.

398
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,202
He lives in Pennsauken
under a different name,

399
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:43,608
Mitchell Gordon.

400
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:45,983
How could you keep this from me? From Ben?

401
00:17:49,596 --> 00:17:50,999
He really needs to know

402
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:53,475
his dad just breezed in and out of his life,

403
00:17:53,475 --> 00:17:55,114
drunk and incoherent?

404
00:17:55,114 --> 00:17:59,162
It's better to think the
man's dead but decent.

405
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,227
<i>You realize I have to invite someone else</i>

406
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:10,865
<i>to the Rubio fight?</i>

407
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:12,438
<i>Nope. No realization whatsoever.</i>

408
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:14,579
You have a LoJack on your leg.

409
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:16,251
I was happy watching the
fight on pay-per-view.

410
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:18,056
You're the one who insisted
we go to Atlantic City.

411
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:34,113
Your biological father was a decent,

412
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,517
God-fearing minister.

413
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:37,591
The guy who raised you
was a cold-hearted jerk.

414
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:40,101
I'm trying to figure out
why you're so convinced

415
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:42,845
Adams has parentally inflicted damage.

416
00:18:42,845 --> 00:18:44,116
You're trying to deflect.

417
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:45,788
Now you are.

418
00:18:45,788 --> 00:18:49,201
You have to believe that every
parent screws up every child

419
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:51,475
or you were screwed out
of a decent childhood.

420
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:53,448
My decent daddy of the cloth

421
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:56,894
was also being indecent with my married mom.

422
00:18:56,894 --> 00:18:59,737
He probably would have taken
other kids to the playground.

423
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:05,558
It's not my fault. Bad parenting.

424
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:17,468
Mitchell Gordon?

425
00:19:17,468 --> 00:19:19,909
I've already got a religion. Go away.

426
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,016
We're doctors.

427
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:23,388
Your son Ben is in the hospital,

428
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:24,458
at Princeton-Plainsboro.

429
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,830
He's very sick.

430
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:31,850
Yeah, well, I don't have a son. Not anymore.

431
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,389
We know there are some issues there,

432
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:35,864
but your bone marrow could cure him.

433
00:19:35,864 --> 00:19:38,172
There's a hospital two miles from here.

434
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:39,443
It's a simple test.

435
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:41,350
You said he was at Princeton-Plainsboro?

436
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,761
His mother feels it's better to do the test

437
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:46,066
at a different hospital.

438
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:49,577
Well, I guess I don't have a son anymore.

439
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:54,728
House isn't gonna give up.

440
00:19:54,728 --> 00:19:56,435
Just tell him about your parents

441
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:57,772
or make up a lie.

442
00:19:57,772 --> 00:19:59,746
I don't want to lie.

443
00:19:59,746 --> 00:20:02,154
I don't want to validate
his ridiculous theory.

444
00:20:02,154 --> 00:20:03,961
It's not ridiculous.

445
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,600
Even the best-intentioned parents

446
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,003
end up damaging their kids.

447
00:20:07,003 --> 00:20:09,915
You're a smart, successful doctor.

448
00:20:09,915 --> 00:20:12,055
How much damage could you have?

449
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:18,375
Know how I got interested in medicine?

450
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,282
When my mother drank,
she couldn't handle me,

451
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:23,258
so she locked me in my father's study.

452
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:26,001
Only so many hours you can
cry and bang on the door

453
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:29,311
before you give up, find something to read.

454
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,553
We all have family dysfunction.

455
00:20:31,553 --> 00:20:35,033
That's why we're successful.
To fill that hole.

456
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:42,895
My parents have a lot of money,

457
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:46,307
but they didn't make it legally.

458
00:20:46,307 --> 00:20:48,114
White-collar crime?

459
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,388
It started with card games.

460
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:53,332
High-stakes poker.

461
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:55,907
Then my dad got into narcotics,

462
00:20:55,907 --> 00:21:01,827
at first just selling but then using too,

463
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:04,536
or he never would have
gotten into the slave trade.

464
00:21:04,536 --> 00:21:08,214
Children mostly.
Easier to pack in small crates.

465
00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:10,355
Plus the shipping's a lot cheaper.

466
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,377
Won't even trust a co-worker.

467
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:18,317
What did your parents do to you?

468
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,070
You have to go see him yourself.

469
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,448
He wouldn't even come to
the door a second time.

470
00:21:27,448 --> 00:21:29,789
Okay. I'll drive over there.

471
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,438
It's a pleural effusion.

472
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:44,776
He had a bleeding problem earlier.

473
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:46,113
Must be bleeding into his lungs.

474
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,844
Except there's no blood.

475
00:22:04,844 --> 00:22:06,148
What does it mean?

476
00:22:06,148 --> 00:22:07,485
It means you don't have to make that drive.

477
00:22:07,485 --> 00:22:08,790
The problem isn't his marrow.

478
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,661
It's his liver.

479
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,299
<i>Liver failure. Explains everything.</i>

480
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,028
The question is,
what explains the liver failure?

481
00:22:19,028 --> 00:22:20,400
It's not an infection.

482
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,239
We tried antibiotics,
but he's not responding.

483
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:23,911
More curiously, what explains the mom

484
00:22:23,911 --> 00:22:28,428
lying about dad pushing
up squirting daisies?

485
00:22:28,428 --> 00:22:33,512
This is how you plan to
get to the boxing game?

486
00:22:33,512 --> 00:22:35,017
Why are you looking at her?

487
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:38,864
'Cause I'm stunned,
and I have to look at something.

488
00:22:38,864 --> 00:22:44,952
Match, bout, fight, contest, day, Helena.

489
00:22:44,952 --> 00:22:46,926
Almost anything works after "boxing,"

490
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:48,833
except the word "game."

491
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:50,205
<i>Your bigger problem is,</i>

492
00:22:50,205 --> 00:22:52,178
the people who design those
things aren't idiots.

493
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:56,659
Can you believe she used to work in the can?

494
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:58,097
Nothing is tamper-proof.

495
00:22:58,097 --> 00:22:59,369
<i>It's a synthetic problem.</i>

496
00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:01,207
His liver's not synthesizing proteins,

497
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:03,114
so fluid is leaking out
of his blood vessels.

498
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:04,786
And mom's a selfish jerk.

499
00:23:04,786 --> 00:23:06,592
<i>She traded up, married a lawyer,</i>

500
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:08,900
wants to forget the lowly circus clown.

501
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,074
You're defending the father
because you feel like a jerk

502
00:23:11,074 --> 00:23:13,449
for baking buns in two different ovens.

503
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:16,126
<i>You want to believe the mythical
biological connection</i>

504
00:23:16,126 --> 00:23:17,631
excuses being a man slut.

505
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:18,382
Ow!

506
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:21,143
I don't know why I'm starting
to doubt your expertise.

507
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:22,917
You do have a classified
ad and a piece of metal.

508
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:25,192
It's temperature that
sets it off, not force.

509
00:23:25,192 --> 00:23:26,931
The rivets go pop,
I slide in the heating pad.

510
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:28,436
Easy peasy.

511
00:23:28,436 --> 00:23:30,208
More likely the patient has
a hyperammonemic problem.

512
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,016
<i>His liver's not cleaning out his blood.</i>

513
00:23:32,016 --> 00:23:33,855
<i>The buildup of toxins is causing everything.</i>

514
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:35,595
I'm defending the dad
because he got screwed.

515
00:23:35,595 --> 00:23:37,500
After he lost his son, he lost his job.

516
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,674
<i>Been in and out of rehab, gave up clowning.</i>

517
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:41,748
Yes, as a parent, I empathize.

518
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:42,918
I say we tell the kid.

519
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:44,959
He's a minor, the mom's his guardian,

520
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:47,100
and it's not even medically relevant.

521
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,407
She robbed them of 12 years together.

522
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:51,448
Or she ripped off the band-aid too late.

523
00:23:51,448 --> 00:23:54,391
<i>That memory that she let son
of Bozo establish</i>

524
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,201
is making him chase his
father's moronic profession

525
00:23:57,201 --> 00:24:01,283
when he could be living
the high life in Portland.

526
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:03,724
And I mean that metaphorically, of course.

527
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:09,379
This is where you dazzle me
with your contingency plan.

528
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:21,722
I see why employers are
reluctant to hire ex-cons.

529
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:26,705
Well, what about the patient?

530
00:24:26,705 --> 00:24:29,548
Is the problem hyperammonemic or synthetic?

531
00:24:29,548 --> 00:24:31,255
<i>Can't treat for both.</i>

532
00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:33,262
One requires hemodialysis,
the other a liver transplant,

533
00:24:33,262 --> 00:24:34,934
and we couldn't even get
the kid a marrow match.

534
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:37,310
Get the mom's consent to
pump him full of protein.

535
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,049
<i>If it's a synthetic problem,</i>

536
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,287
more fluid will leak into his chest

537
00:24:40,287 --> 00:24:41,358
and his heart will fail.

538
00:24:41,358 --> 00:24:42,930
<i>If it's hyperammonemic,</i>

539
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,771
toxins will overwhelm his
body and he'll go into a coma.

540
00:24:44,771 --> 00:24:47,581
Do you only like tests that
involve the risk of death?

541
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:49,120
There are some slower,
less conclusive tests,

542
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,562
but why take that risk?

543
00:24:58,586 --> 00:24:59,991
In here.

544
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,133
Oh, my God. The water.

545
00:25:11,734 --> 00:25:13,673
This is completely my fault.

546
00:25:16,987 --> 00:25:18,625
<i>There are very serious risks,</i>

547
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:20,129
<i>but if we don't figure out what he has,</i>

548
00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:22,740
we can't treat him at all.

549
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:32,207
I may be a little out of bounds here,

550
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:34,314
but in case there are complications,

551
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:36,555
it might be a good time
to come clean to your son,

552
00:25:36,555 --> 00:25:39,531
let his father visit.

553
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:41,204
A little out of bounds?

554
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:45,385
I don't know the history,
but everyone makes mistakes.

555
00:25:45,385 --> 00:25:46,957
Your son worships him.

556
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:48,963
Doctor's right about that.

557
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:51,773
Oh, yeah? And when did he learn that?

558
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:53,647
When he encouraged Ben
to drop out of school?

559
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:57,695
Mitchell is not Ben's father

560
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:59,501
any more than a sperm donor would have been.

561
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,567
Dr. House?

562
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,942
Unless you're a locksmith or an electrician

563
00:26:10,942 --> 00:26:12,915
with political contacts, I'm busy.

564
00:26:12,915 --> 00:26:14,655
<i>My husband saw you in the clinic.</i>

565
00:26:14,655 --> 00:26:16,561
Wants treatment for diabetes.

566
00:26:16,561 --> 00:26:19,037
My condolences on your forthcoming divorce.

567
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:20,676
<i>He keeps imagining symptoms,</i>

568
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:24,590
and now I have to make him these
awful anti-diabetic meals.

569
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,664
Since I have no intention of testing him,

570
00:26:26,664 --> 00:26:30,744
treating him, or cooking for him--

571
00:26:30,744 --> 00:26:34,390
Could you write me a fake
prescription for Insulin?

572
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,498
The advantage of fake prescriptions is,

573
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:38,606
you don't have to be a
real doctor to write one.

574
00:26:38,606 --> 00:26:41,750
Just tell me what's safe
to inject in his thigh.

575
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,891
<i>His symptoms will go away</i>

576
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:46,333
and then I can show him he was never sick.

577
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:47,437
Water?

578
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:50,448
Imaginary medicine is not my specialty.

579
00:26:50,448 --> 00:26:52,388
I do have an imaginary colleague

580
00:26:52,388 --> 00:26:55,098
who's just sent me an imaginary page.

581
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:56,470
Imagine how sorry I am.

582
00:27:04,935 --> 00:27:07,644
Still mad about what happened in the lab?

583
00:27:07,644 --> 00:27:10,119
I'm not mad. I'm being professional.

584
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:12,862
You claim you're not screwed up.

585
00:27:12,862 --> 00:27:14,467
You may even believe it.

586
00:27:14,467 --> 00:27:15,939
But House doesn't and I don't,

587
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:18,481
so you can wait till he camps
out on your parents' lawn

588
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,421
or you can admit you don't
live on some higher plane

589
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:21,692
and thank me later.

590
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:24,601
My, uh, my eye feels weird.

591
00:27:29,085 --> 00:27:31,092
What's happening to me?

592
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:36,813
You look tired.

593
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:38,620
I hate it when people say that.

594
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,024
I know, I look bad.

595
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:42,065
I thought you were gonna
go to bed early last night.

596
00:27:42,065 --> 00:27:44,909
Like an idiot,
I went out with my girlfriends

597
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:46,247
to pretend I have a life,

598
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,790
when all I did was flirt with guys

599
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:50,362
who'd have no interest in a mom,

600
00:27:50,362 --> 00:27:52,603
miss the baby I couldn't wait to get rid of,

601
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:53,572
and then get yelled at by my mom

602
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,543
for staying out too late.

603
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:56,148
You need your own place. Yes.

604
00:27:56,148 --> 00:27:59,259
I moved back home because it was
too drafty at the Four Seasons.

605
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:00,563
So go back to work at the hospital.

606
00:28:00,563 --> 00:28:03,305
Day care costs more than
what I earned as a nurse.

607
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:08,322
Have you considered sub-standard day care?

608
00:28:08,322 --> 00:28:11,267
Why don't you stay here tonight?

609
00:28:11,267 --> 00:28:14,343
No. I mean, in the guest room.

610
00:28:14,343 --> 00:28:15,716
I'll watch the baby again,

611
00:28:15,716 --> 00:28:16,652
and you can get a real night's sleep.

612
00:28:16,652 --> 00:28:18,960
You'd do that?

613
00:28:27,325 --> 00:28:28,863
Win-win.

614
00:28:28,863 --> 00:28:30,469
Mommy gets a rest,

615
00:28:30,469 --> 00:28:33,245
daddy gets more time with his little angel.

616
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:38,161
There's some sweats in
the closet in the back.

617
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:43,814
Lucky girl.

618
00:28:43,814 --> 00:28:48,797
Gets another sleepover with da-da.

619
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:52,544
It makes a difference.

620
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:53,881
Doesn't it?

621
00:29:05,227 --> 00:29:06,933
Didn't answer your page last night.

622
00:29:06,933 --> 00:29:08,437
Sorry. Battery died.

623
00:29:08,437 --> 00:29:09,976
We got the patient's eye back in place

624
00:29:09,976 --> 00:29:11,650
with steroid injections,

625
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,828
but a bulging eyeball means
it's not a liver problem.

626
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:17,369
And mom's determination to keep dad away,

627
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,611
even as her kid gets sicker and sicker,

628
00:29:19,611 --> 00:29:20,916
means she's got more to hide.

629
00:29:20,916 --> 00:29:22,220
It's not diagnostically relevant.

630
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,291
<i>Let's let it drop.</i>

631
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,360
You just lost my vote.

632
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,769
You flip-flopped on parental rights.

633
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:28,274
I've been trying to persuade the mother,

634
00:29:28,274 --> 00:29:30,047
but it's her son, so it's her call.

635
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:31,418
Well, that's very evolved of you.

636
00:29:31,418 --> 00:29:35,097
Don't usually see Darwinian
changes over breakfast.

637
00:29:35,097 --> 00:29:39,580
You made nice-nice with Phil,
you decided that

638
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:43,025
he'd make a decent father
for thing 2 after all.

639
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:44,732
I had Sophie again last night

640
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:46,271
and Ruby slept in my guest room,

641
00:29:46,271 --> 00:29:48,210
<i>which has nothing to do with Phil,</i>

642
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,252
who will never be a father to my children.

643
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:52,894
Angioneurotic edema can
cause rapid swelling.

644
00:29:52,894 --> 00:29:55,302
Hey, we're having a conversation here.

645
00:29:55,302 --> 00:29:57,176
No abdominal pain.

646
00:29:57,176 --> 00:29:58,815
So that must have been nice, having Ruby

647
00:29:58,815 --> 00:30:00,086
and the baby under one roof.

648
00:30:00,086 --> 00:30:02,328
Yes, it was nice having
my daughter in my home.

649
00:30:02,328 --> 00:30:04,971
That's why I would like her
sister to live near my home.

650
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,376
Anasarca?

651
00:30:06,376 --> 00:30:07,848
Swelling would have followed gravity.

652
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,858
Isn't that getting this whole
parenting thing ass backwards?

653
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:13,534
<i>Aren't you supposed to figure out
what you can sacrifice</i>

654
00:30:13,534 --> 00:30:15,173
to maximize their niceness?

655
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:17,147
And do you think I should sacrifice myself

656
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:18,016
from their lives?

657
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,555
Just one life,

658
00:30:19,555 --> 00:30:23,167
until the other one's mommy
meets someone nicer than you.

659
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:25,275
Swelling that fast and localized

660
00:30:25,275 --> 00:30:26,613
has to come from the lymph nodes.

661
00:30:26,613 --> 00:30:28,486
<i>Burkitt's lymphoma.</i>

662
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,976
Swelling. Cankles.

663
00:30:34,976 --> 00:30:36,147
<i>That's not a symptom of Burkitt's.</i>

664
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:38,790
Are you saying it's-- it's Burkitt's.

665
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,228
Prep him for chemo.

666
00:30:53,075 --> 00:30:54,244
I think you should give House permission

667
00:30:54,244 --> 00:30:55,582
to go to Atlantic City.

668
00:30:55,582 --> 00:30:58,326
We'll stop by the rheumatology conference.

669
00:30:58,326 --> 00:31:00,566
Everyone's covered. No.

670
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:04,447
The guy has earned the right
to go to one boxing match.

671
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:06,220
He's done everything you've asked--

672
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,026
funded and staffed his own department.

673
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:10,434
Hasn't even broken as much as a traffic law.

674
00:31:10,434 --> 00:31:12,843
You're right.

675
00:31:12,843 --> 00:31:14,985
So you'll let him go?

676
00:31:14,985 --> 00:31:15,737
No.

677
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:18,967
<i>I get why he wants to go to that fight.</i>

678
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:20,539
I'd love to go myself,

679
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:22,211
which is kind of why I have to stop him.

680
00:31:22,211 --> 00:31:24,687
My job is to be the jerk.

681
00:31:24,687 --> 00:31:26,996
House has to believe that
I have authority over him.

682
00:31:26,996 --> 00:31:29,371
He can't function under someone's thumb.

683
00:31:29,371 --> 00:31:31,512
I know, which means you can't go either.

684
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:38,235
Your job is to be his friend,

685
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:39,874
to stay here and sit with him

686
00:31:39,874 --> 00:31:41,178
and watch the fight on pay-per-view

687
00:31:41,178 --> 00:31:42,149
while bitching about me.

688
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:43,721
If we both do our jobs,

689
00:31:43,721 --> 00:31:46,162
we might actually get
him through his parole.

690
00:31:50,011 --> 00:31:51,750
You're right.

691
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,203
<i>Sorry to show up like this.</i>

692
00:31:57,203 --> 00:31:59,042
I was expecting a battery of lawyers.

693
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:00,514
No lawyers.

694
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:03,291
Phil had something that
he would like to say,

695
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:06,736
so I thought that he
should say it in person.

696
00:32:06,736 --> 00:32:09,547
It was wrong of me to confront you

697
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:11,018
about taking Rachel to Portland.

698
00:32:11,018 --> 00:32:14,063
You don't want to move to Portland?

699
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:17,241
Of course I do, but this
is about your daughter too

700
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:18,780
and I'm not gonna do something like this

701
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,553
without your support.

702
00:32:20,553 --> 00:32:23,831
So you guys are trying to manipulate me

703
00:32:23,831 --> 00:32:25,904
by playing good cop/good cop?

704
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:29,650
Is that how little you think of me?

705
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,130
It's clear you're back working for House.

706
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,203
I will see you this weekend
when you pick up Sophie.

707
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,843
Sophia.

708
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:38,516
We actually started calling her Sophie.

709
00:32:38,516 --> 00:32:39,519
Yeah.

710
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,241
Great.

711
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,503
It's cute.

712
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,431
Cankles.

713
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:55,643
Is there some problem with
the prescription you gave me?

714
00:32:55,643 --> 00:32:59,022
I'm faint. I've been gaining more weight.

715
00:32:59,022 --> 00:33:00,561
I think I need a bigger dose.

716
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,338
If you double his placebo, he might drown.

717
00:33:03,338 --> 00:33:09,059
Also, you forgot to mention
that your heart rate is slow.

718
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,465
My--my heart rate is not--

719
00:33:11,937 --> 00:33:15,114
52. The technical term is slow.

720
00:33:15,114 --> 00:33:18,694
Those awful anti-diabetic meals you eat,

721
00:33:18,694 --> 00:33:20,333
do they contain bok choy?

722
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,005
A pound of it. Every day.

723
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:27,525
Bok choy has glucosinolates
which inhibit thyroid function

724
00:33:27,525 --> 00:33:29,565
and account for all your symptoms.

725
00:33:29,565 --> 00:33:31,974
So this isn't diabetes?

726
00:33:31,974 --> 00:33:34,918
You have a bad case of irony.

727
00:33:34,918 --> 00:33:36,558
The food that you're eating
to stop making you sick

728
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:38,164
is making you sick.

729
00:33:38,164 --> 00:33:41,509
Hey, maybe I don't have my
father's crummy genes after all.

730
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:43,751
On the other hand, maybe you're fat enough

731
00:33:43,751 --> 00:33:45,056
to get diabetes even without him.

732
00:33:51,379 --> 00:33:53,653
I can't believe I have cancer.

733
00:33:53,653 --> 00:33:57,332
We caught it early. You should be okay.

734
00:33:57,332 --> 00:34:00,709
I could die. I never went anywhere,
did anything.

735
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:02,884
If my father had lived,

736
00:34:02,884 --> 00:34:05,392
everything would have been different.

737
00:34:05,392 --> 00:34:08,001
Your mom and stepdad love you.

738
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:10,141
They've given you a great home.

739
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:13,287
That counts for a lot.

740
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:17,434
He's crashing. Everything's shutting down.

741
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:28,224
<i>Renal failure, lung failure, heart failure,</i>

742
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,131
<i>all before we started chemo.</i>

743
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:32,807
<i>Burkitt's lymphoma is fast-moving,
but not this fast.</i>

744
00:34:35,785 --> 00:34:40,769
No rush. ICU stands for
take your time in Latin.

745
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:42,977
Multiple aneurysms.

746
00:34:42,977 --> 00:34:45,084
That would mean that every
symptom after his T.I.A.

747
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,120
was a coincidence.

748
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,592
Cholesterol emboli?

749
00:34:47,592 --> 00:34:50,168
Bingo. Fits perfectly. Check the file.

750
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:52,744
Confirm that we did major
abdominal surgery on him

751
00:34:52,744 --> 00:34:56,122
<i>and then completely forgot about it.</i>

752
00:34:56,122 --> 00:34:56,891
<i>House.</i>

753
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,512
Hello?

754
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,626
What the hell are you doing here?

755
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:09,532
I was told that this might be
my last chance to see my son.

756
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:12,544
You had no right!
This is none of your business!

757
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:14,650
- I didn't.
- I called him.

758
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,122
This man's Ben's hero.

759
00:35:16,122 --> 00:35:17,326
Let them spend five minutes together.

760
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,012
No! Get out of here!

761
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:29,770
Wait.

762
00:35:36,226 --> 00:35:38,367
You sexually molested your son.

763
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:39,906
Your walk.

764
00:35:39,906 --> 00:35:41,645
<i>Tabes dorsalis.</i>

765
00:35:41,645 --> 00:35:44,087
<i>You have late-stage syphilis,</i>

766
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:47,834
which you gave to our patient
presumably 12 years ago,

767
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:51,313
<i>which also explains why mom is not
big on family reunions.</i>

768
00:35:53,087 --> 00:35:55,428
I shouldn't be here.

769
00:36:03,725 --> 00:36:07,938
We tested him for syphilis. He was negative.

770
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:11,384
<i>After 12 years, the active infection
would have died down</i>

771
00:36:11,384 --> 00:36:13,993
everywhere except the arteries in his brain,

772
00:36:13,993 --> 00:36:15,666
where it could hide out from our tests.

773
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:17,605
<i>But when that six-year-old heckler</i>

774
00:36:17,605 --> 00:36:19,713
<i>punched him in his juggling pins,</i>

775
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:22,456
<i>it kicked up the dormant
bacteria in his pelvis.</i>

776
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:24,195
<i>The immunosuppressants we gave him</i>

777
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:25,667
<i>sent it into overdrive.</i>

778
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,406
<i>The antibiotics we gave him</i>

779
00:36:27,406 --> 00:36:29,446
<i>actually started destroying the syphilis.</i>

780
00:36:29,446 --> 00:36:31,721
<i>But like pouring water on a fire,</i>

781
00:36:31,721 --> 00:36:34,029
<i>that led to a trail of toxic smoke and ash</i>

782
00:36:34,029 --> 00:36:36,470
<i>which made his immune system overcompensate.</i>

783
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:39,011
<i>Severe Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.</i>

784
00:36:39,011 --> 00:36:41,386
Is this true?

785
00:36:41,386 --> 00:36:42,858
Yes, Jarisch-Herxheimer is real.

786
00:36:42,858 --> 00:36:44,899
It sounds silly, but...

787
00:36:44,899 --> 00:36:47,911
Oh, you mean the--the--right.

788
00:36:51,457 --> 00:36:56,607
I found stains on his clothes.

789
00:36:58,481 --> 00:37:02,863
He didn't understand and
he didn't seem traumatized.

790
00:37:02,863 --> 00:37:08,015
I kept trying to talk to him,
but before long, he'd forgotten,

791
00:37:08,015 --> 00:37:10,658
and he seemed--

792
00:37:10,658 --> 00:37:13,802
and he seemed happy and he seemed normal.

793
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:15,273
So you made daddy go away

794
00:37:15,273 --> 00:37:18,753
and you made sure junior had
no reason to go looking.

795
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:21,028
I was just trying to protect him,

796
00:37:21,028 --> 00:37:24,942
<i>like I should have done from the start.</i>

797
00:37:26,984 --> 00:37:28,120
Sorry.

798
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,477
<i>IV penicillin and anti-TNF antibodies,</i>

799
00:37:34,477 --> 00:37:36,216
<i>he'll be fine.</i>

800
00:37:36,216 --> 00:37:40,967
Apart from the whole daddy-rape thing.

801
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,459
We're not done.

802
00:37:48,459 --> 00:37:50,198
No, we are not.

803
00:37:50,198 --> 00:37:52,339
Notify the dad's sexual partners.

804
00:37:52,339 --> 00:37:54,613
Notify his employer, his landlord.

805
00:37:54,613 --> 00:37:56,051
Notify the police.

806
00:37:56,051 --> 00:37:57,523
I meant the kid.

807
00:37:57,523 --> 00:37:59,262
We're not gonna tell him he was molested?

808
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:02,307
To make him miserable or
to forfeit your license?

809
00:38:02,307 --> 00:38:03,879
To tell him the truth.

810
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:06,923
He's a virgin. How do we explain the STD?

811
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:08,697
It's a medical diagnosis. Screw the parents.

812
00:38:08,697 --> 00:38:09,901
The kid's our patient.

813
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:11,808
I guess Taub's got a tough choice to make

814
00:38:11,808 --> 00:38:13,647
when the kid wakes up.

815
00:38:13,647 --> 00:38:15,086
Why is it my choice?

816
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:16,658
'Cause you're a dad.

817
00:38:16,658 --> 00:38:19,200
How could the rest of
us possibly understand?

818
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:30,576
What was-- what was wrong with me?

819
00:38:33,988 --> 00:38:35,560
It's called syphilis.

820
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:41,146
Uh, you--you can get
that without having sex?

821
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:56,165
I didn't tell him.

822
00:38:59,243 --> 00:39:01,115
Your heart said he needed to know.

823
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:05,565
Your brain knew he's better off without it.

824
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:07,539
Following your heart is easy.

825
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:09,279
Following your brain is tough.

826
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:11,352
<i>Especially after years of following</i>

827
00:39:11,352 --> 00:39:13,996
<i>that much smaller third organ.</i>

828
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:19,381
That's why all parents
screw up all children.

829
00:39:27,209 --> 00:39:28,747
Evening.

830
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:39,115
Clever tactic, pretending
you're not interested anymore.

831
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:42,761
How could that possibly work as a tactic?

832
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,869
The fact is, once I saw those incompletes,

833
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:46,676
I knew your parents screwed you up.

834
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:50,490
The details are just gravy.

835
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,066
You're wrong.

836
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:56,712
The only evidence you have
is proof of something else.

837
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:01,061
I ran away from home.

838
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:06,346
Because you had lousy parents.

839
00:40:06,346 --> 00:40:09,924
Because I didn't.

840
00:40:09,924 --> 00:40:13,269
All my friends' parents were divorced

841
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:15,075
or having affairs

842
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:19,825
or barely knew their kids' birthdays.

843
00:40:19,825 --> 00:40:24,107
You envied their dysfunction?

844
00:40:24,107 --> 00:40:28,758
I-I thought it made them deeper somehow.

845
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:34,379
It was stupid.

846
00:40:34,379 --> 00:40:38,059
I hitchhiked to Manhattan,
moved in with an older guy.

847
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:41,405
In two months, I came running home.

848
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:45,719
It took my parents years to get over it.

849
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:48,896
That's when you started to excel.

850
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:52,408
You were making it up to them.

851
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,154
Your parents screwed you
up by not screwing you up.

852
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:58,362
How does briefly wishing I was screwed up

853
00:40:58,362 --> 00:41:01,137
make me screwed up?

854
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:03,077
It's normal to be screwed up.

855
00:41:03,077 --> 00:41:06,557
It's really screwed up to romanticize it.

856
00:41:06,557 --> 00:41:10,838
I guess that's why you wanted
to work with prisoners.

857
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:14,584
It's why I wanted to work with you.

858
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:20,304
It was a tactic.

859
00:41:37,868 --> 00:41:39,607
Chris.

860
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:40,744
<i>Yeah.</i>

861
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:43,319
I need to talk to you and Phil.

862
00:41:45,495 --> 00:41:48,639
Is everything okay?

863
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,344
Yeah.

864
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:03,725
I can't let you move.

865
00:42:03,725 --> 00:42:05,196
You drove all the way out here

866
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:07,438
just to tell us what you already told us.

867
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:10,616
I'm sorry.

868
00:42:20,518 --> 00:42:21,821
<i>House, open up.</i>

869
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:23,394
<i>I don't want to miss the opening bell.</i>

870
00:42:27,475 --> 00:42:29,314
House?

871
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:43,162
<i>...Telecast, we expect an
electric atmosphere</i>

872
00:42:43,162 --> 00:42:45,470
<i>in the arena and a sellout
crowd of about 10,000</i>

873
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:48,213
<i>for Rubio versus Santos, two great fighters</i>

874
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:49,954
<i>with illustrious careers</i>

875
00:42:49,954 --> 00:42:51,827
<i>who might have been expected
to meet a long time ago.</i>

876
00:42:51,827 --> 00:42:54,202
<i>As for Santos, his handlers tell us</i>

877
00:42:54,202 --> 00:42:55,441
<i>that he's done more roadwork</i>

878
00:42:55,441 --> 00:42:57,080
<i>than at any time in his career,</i>

879
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:00,458
<i>hoping to prove tonight that he
can box for 12 full rounds.</i>

880
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:03,603
<i>Significant because Santos hasn't
heard the final bell</i>

881
00:43:03,603 --> 00:43:05,811
<i>in more than six years.</i>

882
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:07,851
<i>He comes in with 11 straight knockout wins</i>

883
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:10,761
<i>and we saw how a power puncher
with a left hook</i>

884
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:13,103
<i>was able to cut Rubio over the right eye</i>
