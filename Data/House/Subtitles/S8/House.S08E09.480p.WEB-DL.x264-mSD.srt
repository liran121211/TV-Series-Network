00:00:03,288 --> 00:00:04,526
We're in the car, honey.

2
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:10,298
We're going to
the hospital for tests.

3
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:16,282
We're in the hospital.

4
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:20,119
We're going
to the Doctor's office.

5
00:00:20,203 --> 00:00:21,737
Yeah.

6
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:29,829
Can you tell me
what this is called?

7
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:32,331
Uh, you use it to get
food from inside.

8
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:35,668
Yes, but what's
it called?

9
00:00:35,752 --> 00:00:37,336
Is it a spatula?

10
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:39,388
- No.
<i>- Good.</i>

11
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,622
Is it a can opener?

12
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,426
Uh, no, it's, um...

13
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,795
It's, um...

14
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:50,566
You're trying
to make me look stupid.

15
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,984
You can go to hell!

16
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:53,853
Why don't you
kill yourself?

17
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:56,155
Andres.

18
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,940
It's okay.

19
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:04,697
There she is.

20
00:01:04,781 --> 00:01:06,749
Here I am.

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,950
Here, come on.

22
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,458
You just need to answer
a few more questions.

23
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,343
Then we're going home.
We'll have lunch, okay?

24
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:21,380
Okay.

25
00:01:21,465 --> 00:01:25,017
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:27,669
I have Alzheimer's.

27
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:29,889
I know.

28
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:33,225
The mood swings come on
quickly, but, um...

29
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,060
It's under control.

30
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:38,280
Don't worry. He's actually
perfect for the drug trial.

31
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,400
Oh.

32
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,202
Thank God.

33
00:01:43,286 --> 00:01:45,037
We can start
as soon as next week.

a phase-two trial

Isn't that the point
of having a spare?

64
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,297
I denied his request.

- It's 10:15 on Friday.
- <i>Damn it.</i>

76
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:56,168
Look, the point is
I saw this coming.

77
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:58,820
Dr. Foreman and I did not
always see eye-to-eye.

78
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,873
But he never had the power
to overrule me.

79
00:04:00,957 --> 00:04:02,424
Now that he has the power,
he won't be able

80
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,493
to resist the temptation
to use it.

81
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:07,463
With great power
comes great micromanaging.

82
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,881
And great vests.

83
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:11,500
I know you're
the better diagnostician.

84
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,136
I'm not gonna interfere.
I'm only here to help.

85
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:16,472
Could be transient nitrogen load
from a G.I. bleed.

86
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,006
Not if the vomiting's
persistent.

87
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,776
Which we won't know, because
the E.R. put him on antiemetics.

88
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,177
Take him off.

89
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:25,698
Wait. He's puking his guts out.
We'd risk aspiration.

90
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,902
I'm just disagreeing,
not overruling.

91
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:31,904
So glad you're on board.

92
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:34,239
<i>Take him off antiemetics,</i>

93
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:37,493
do an upper endoscopy
to check for bleeds.

94
00:04:41,665 --> 00:04:44,299
It could be
a bladder infection.

95
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,701
We'll run
a pregnancy test.

96
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:47,002
Oh, I'm not pregnant.

97
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,421
Any type of birth control
can fail.

98
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,206
Not mine.

99
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:56,011
Oh, I'm sorry.
You said you were married.

100
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,262
Yeah, happily.

101
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:59,515
That's okay.

102
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,185
Sex can wane in any
marriage over time.

103
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,054
No, no.
We've never had sex.

104
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:08,273
Oh, we kiss and cuddle,

105
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:12,060
but neither one of us
is interested in sex.

106
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:15,247
You're...both celibate.

107
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,166
No, neither of us.

108
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:21,587
Celibacy is a choice.
This is our orientation.

109
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:25,708
We're asexual.

110
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,595
Not quite sure
what box to check here.

111
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:31,046
<i>You're making a mistake.</i>

112
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,681
If I had the power
to veto him,

113
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,017
given all the crap I've
put up with over the years,

114
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,769
don't know if I could
use it objectively.

115
00:05:36,853 --> 00:05:39,722
I do, I can, I have.

116
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:42,808
Might be easier if you'd
stay out of the room.

117
00:05:42,892 --> 00:05:44,359
I thought
it'd be different.

118
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,028
This week.

119
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,446
Supposed to talk
to his P.O.

120
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,115
about getting his
ankle monitor off early.

121
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,600
You're saying he should
defer to you?

122
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,403
No, I'm just saying what he's
doing doesn't seem rational,

123
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,121
which makes me think
it's rational

124
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:58,073
in a way
I'm not privy to.

125
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,908
He always has a plan.

126
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,994
And he's always
self-destructive.

127
00:06:02,078 --> 00:06:07,716
He may just be shooting
himself in the ankle.

128
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,056
I know it feels strange.

129
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:16,008
Dr. Chase is just
looking in your throat.

130
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:17,509
<i>We're in the hospital.</i>

131
00:06:17,594 --> 00:06:19,461
You're fine.

132
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,814

trophy, there, Andres.

133
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,298
<i>He coached youth soccer.</i>

134
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,850
Took a team that was 0-6

135
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:28,804
all the way to the state finals
at Long Branch.

136
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,976
Hey, thanks for
doing this in here.

137
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,429
Switching rooms
can be very disorienting.

138
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:38,947
You take very good
care of him.

139
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,201
I love him.
Sickness and health, right?

140
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:44,253
Upper esophagus
is clear.

141
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,589
Moving on to
the G.E. junction.

142
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,674
Hi.

143
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:50,843
- Hey.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

144
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:52,795
Family members only
during procedures.

145
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,797
Uh, I'll--
I'll be outside.

146
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:55,931
Oh, no. Please, um,

147
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,183
<i>it's okay.</i>

148
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:02,020
Joseph helps me
with my husband sometimes.

149
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:03,338
He's a good friend.

150
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,308
Which means not family.

151
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,776
<i>Wait, we're gonna</i>
<i>be here a while.</i>

152
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,813
Why don't you show Joseph
where the visitor's lounge is?

153
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,981
Okay.

154
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,404
What?

155
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:22,324
Surprised you didn't
go into the diplomatic corps.

156
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,443
Oh, you think
they're...

157
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:30,983
No, if they're having sex, it's
probably with their genitals.

158
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,001
Mallory-Weiss tear.

159
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,337
Vomiting must have
torn the lining.

160
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:40,425
You know that close to
1% of the population

161
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,929
identifies as asexual?

162
00:07:44,013 --> 00:07:47,182
We really gotta
get you laid.

163
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,051
If I have to plough
that furrow myself, so be it.

164
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:52,321
I have a patient
who's asexual.

165
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,857
Is she a giant pool
of algae?

166
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,742
It's a valid
sexual orientation.

167
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,327
According to this
article, at least.

168
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,279
Yeah, I think
I read that too.

169
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:01,897
Is that
<i>fugliness weekly?</i>

170
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,665
She's perfectly
fine-looking.

171
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,000
Happily married
for ten years.

172
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,952
To a guy who loves penis
enough for the both of them.

173
00:08:07,036 --> 00:08:10,339
He's asexual too.

174
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:11,673
Ran a complete
physical on her.

175
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:16,461
Nothing wrong except
a common bladder infection.

176
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:19,681
100 bucks says I can
find a medical reason

177
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,966
why she doesn't
want to have sex.

178
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,517
You're out of your mind

179
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,419
if you think I'm letting you
anywhere near my patient.

180
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,888
Fine.
I won't go near her.

181
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,189
Just give me her file

182
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,691
and any blood samples
you have left over.

183
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,396
No contact, whatsoever.

184
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,198
You talk to her,
the bet is void.

185
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,265
No contact.

186
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:40,101
Plays to my
strengths anyway.

187
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:49,077
Right now's not
a good time, House.

188
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,779
Not for the Dean
of Medicine.

189
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,748
But it's a perfect time
if you're a member of my team.

190
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,284
Which one are you?

191
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,453
What did
the endoscopy show?

192
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,806
<i>No signs of ulcers</i>
<i>or blockages.</i>

193
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,980
But you found a tear
just below the esophagus.

194
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:09,765
Explains the bleeding.

195
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:12,234
Doesn't explain why he vomited
so hard he ripped his insides.

196
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,902
His liver enzymes
are slightly elevated.

197
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,903
Gallstones could've--

198
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,271
no complaints of pain.

199
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:21,026
Steatohepatitis would make his
AST and ATL levels rise.

200
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,029
Are you calling
his liver fat?

201
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:26,581
Start the patient on statins,
and do a biopsy to confirm.

202
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,582
<i>And knock him out.</i>

203
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,251
I've heard he's a wiggler.

204
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,619
There's no need
to put him under.

205
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,205
We can confirm fatty liver
with an ultrasound.

206
00:09:33,272 --> 00:09:36,208
Just making
an observation.

207
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:38,260
Well done.

208
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,761
Now, as a member
of my team,

209
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,964
you can make the equally-useful
observations

210
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,882
that the sky is blue,
I'm wearing pants,

211
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,501
and I'm ignoring
your first observation.

212
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,836
Of course.

213
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:54,226
Wait.

214
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,862
And there it is.

215
00:09:56,946 --> 00:09:58,363
You're trying to screw
with my confidence.

216
00:09:58,448 --> 00:09:59,681
Well, if I wanted
to do that,

217
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,400
I'd tell you how much
the nurses hate you.

218
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:04,036
You're trying to get me to
define myself as a subordinate

219
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,904
to keep me from
ever intervening,

220
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:07,689
even if it's fully
in the scope of my duties.

221
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,041
Like now.

222
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:10,659
<i>This isn't</i>
<i>about diagnostics,</i>

223
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,044
<i>it's about what's safe</i>
<i>for the patient.</i>

224
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:13,745
Do the ultrasound.

225
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,665
Ultrasound it is.

226
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,700
And the nurses love you.

227
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:25,223
You don't think I knew
House was gonna tell you

228
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:27,476
to ignore me and not
do the ultrasound?

229
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,711
This is an
ultrasound machine.

230
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,264
Which you're gonna use to do
an ultrasound-guided biopsy.

231
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:34,182
<i>Probably got a kit</i>
<i>stashed here...</i>

232
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:46,862
"Cuddy dark
will waste his afternoon

233
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,663
chasing
conspiracy theories."

234
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,231
<i>You're letting him</i>
<i>get inside your head.</i>

235
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,784
He could do a lot
of damage in there.

236
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,871
Dr. Chase.

237
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:57,756
He started
vomiting again.

238
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:02,794
This is why we stopped
the antiemetics.

239
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:04,463
<i>We needed to see if</i>
<i>it was still a symptom.</i>

240
00:11:04,547 --> 00:11:06,515
Okay.

241
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,516
Here, you want this?

242
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,634
Get your hands off me.

243
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,436
You're taking my head.

244
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:13,855
It's okay, Andres.

245
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,690
You're in the hospital.

246
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,310
Here.

247
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,283
- 10 milligrams of Diazepam!
- Already on it.

248
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:27,035
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

249
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:30,789
I'm all right.

250
00:11:33,242 --> 00:11:35,110
Foreman.

251
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,112
Blood in his urine.

252
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,537
Resume the antiemetics,
and increase the sedation.

253
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,460
He really went after her.

254
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:48,512
Maybe he found out
about her "good friend."

255
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,299
It was just paranoid rage,
typical of Alzheimer's.

256
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:52,884
We don't even know if they
were sleeping together.

257
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:54,919
A few hours ago
you were sure.

258
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,971
And that's
significant why?

259
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,024
Sorry. Only the bleeding's
medically relevant.

260
00:12:00,091 --> 00:12:01,392
No, I wasn't
being rhetorical.

261
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:03,778
If they are
sleeping together,

262
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:06,430
why do we disapprove?

263
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:07,982
You're pro-infidelity?

264
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:09,617
She's not married.

265
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:13,395
If marriage is feeding
and cleaning someone,

266
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:17,207
limiting conversations, to
repeating a few simple commands,

267
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,060
then I was married
to my pet rat.

268
00:12:19,144 --> 00:12:21,646
And a lot of people
owe me wedding gifts.

269
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:23,397
And we're walking,
we're walking.

270
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:25,399
I don't care how sick
your spouse gets,

271
00:12:25,484 --> 00:12:27,068
you don't jump ship.

272
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:28,385
Alzheimer's
is different.

273
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:29,854
She can't share
her problems with him,

274
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:31,055
or plan for the future.

275
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:32,657
The man she married
no longer exists.

276
00:12:32,724 --> 00:12:34,442
Yes, he does.
He's in there.

277
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:36,327
This is why
you get married.

278
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:39,030
Said the divorced woman
to the divorced man.

279
00:12:39,081 --> 00:12:40,781
I didn't jump ship.

280
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:43,400
My husband sank it
when he cheated on me.

281
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:45,286
Commitment's
not conditional.

282
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:48,039
She is there for him in the only
way that matters now.

283
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,340
She gave up her life
to take care of him.

284
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:50,741
Which proves
she's an idiot.

285
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:52,793
If she had any sense, she'd have
stuck him in a facility

286
00:12:52,878 --> 00:12:54,295
and jumped
on that strange--

287
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,963
Dr. Foreman.

288
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:57,131
We were just
looking for you.

289
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,216
I was right about
the antiemetics.

290
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:00,635
If you kept him
on them like I said,

291
00:13:00,719 --> 00:13:02,520
he wouldn't have gotten agitated
and punched his wife.

292
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:05,056
Yes, we're back to my
supposed diabolical plan

293
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:07,257
to shake your confidence.

294
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:09,560
Let's see if this helps.

295
00:13:09,611 --> 00:13:11,729
If you're speaking
as a team member,

296
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,364
then I'd say
you're a moron.

297
00:13:13,431 --> 00:13:14,932
Because taking him
off the antiemetics

298
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:17,068
gave us crucial
diagnostic information.

299
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:18,903
If you're speaking
as Dean of Medicine,

300
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:20,404
then I'd say
you're a moron.

301
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:23,107
'Cause your micromanaging
kept us from doing a biopsy.

302
00:13:23,158 --> 00:13:24,909
If we had, the patient
would have been anesthetized

303
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,445
hours ago, thus unable to go
all Chris Brown on her ass.

304
00:13:28,497 --> 00:13:30,164
Unless one of your index cards

305
00:13:30,248 --> 00:13:32,783
actually predicted the guy
was gonna punch his wife,

306
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:35,670
everything you're saying
is post hoc rationalization.

307
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:37,221
Dr. Park,

308
00:13:37,288 --> 00:13:40,457
would you please
reach under that chair?

309
00:13:43,145 --> 00:13:46,063
"The patient will
punch his wife."

310
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:49,417
<i>You clearly wrote that</i>
<i>after the fact.</i>

311
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:50,484
Dr. Adams,

312
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:53,971
would you please
reach into my pants?

313
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,328
"Dr. Blackenshmurtz

314
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:04,482
will accuse me of writing
about the punch after the fact."

315
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:05,916
Now, look.

316
00:14:05,984 --> 00:14:08,452
Here's a photograph
of me holding a newspaper.

317
00:14:08,503 --> 00:14:10,171
Dated last Tuesday.

318
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:11,839
Now, how could I have
gotten my hands on that?

319
00:14:11,923 --> 00:14:13,124
You done?

320
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:15,710
Rhabdomyolysis
fits the vomiting,

321
00:14:15,794 --> 00:14:16,994
pigmenturia,
and renal failure.

322
00:14:17,045 --> 00:14:19,046
No muscle symptoms,
and urine had no myoglobin.

323
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:21,215
<i>TTP fits, though.</i>

324
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:24,168
Start him
on plasmapheresis.

325
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:27,221
Unless...

326
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:30,674
Unless I need to say,
"mother, may I?"

327
00:14:30,726 --> 00:14:34,344
And mother
is an abbreviation.

328
00:14:36,398 --> 00:14:39,400
<i>Fresh plasma will replace</i>
<i>the damaged red blood cells</i>

329
00:14:39,484 --> 00:14:40,284
that are clogging
his kidneys.

330
00:14:40,351 --> 00:14:41,202
That sounds hopeful.

331
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:43,988
How is that feeling?

332
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,209
I've never been hit
in the eye before.

333
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:51,028
I feel kinda badass.

334
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:55,249
I think maybe
you should go.

335
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,501
I'm fine. Okay?

336
00:14:57,552 --> 00:14:59,136
See you tomorrow.

337
00:14:59,204 --> 00:15:00,054
Okay.

338
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:06,477
We're not
having an affair.

339
00:15:06,544 --> 00:15:07,728
It's none
of my business.

340
00:15:07,813 --> 00:15:11,682
I mean, not--
not really.

341
00:15:11,733 --> 00:15:12,850
'Cause nothing's happened.

342
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:17,488
We've talked
about it a lot, and...

343
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:21,192
It's just really hard
doing this by myself.

344
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:24,995
When's the last time you had
a full night's sleep?

345
00:15:25,063 --> 00:15:28,532
Um...

346
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:31,368
I don't know.
Three years.

347
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:36,073
You're not going to
get any rest here.

348
00:15:36,124 --> 00:15:38,075
People who are sick
are not the only ones

349
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:40,010
who need to be
taken care of.

350
00:15:47,752 --> 00:15:50,554
Why doesn't Chase
have to be here?

351
00:15:50,605 --> 00:15:52,156
You think he knows
anything about women

352
00:15:52,224 --> 00:15:54,792
who don't want
to have sex?

353
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,794
Hormone levels
are normal.

354
00:15:56,861 --> 00:15:59,130
This woman seems
perfectly healthy.

355
00:15:59,197 --> 00:16:01,015
What does it matter
if she says she's asexual?

356
00:16:01,082 --> 00:16:02,883
It's the fundamental drive
of our species.

357
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:04,135
Sex is healthy.

358
00:16:04,202 --> 00:16:05,769
<i>Orgasms oxygenate</i>
<i>the brain,</i>

359
00:16:05,837 --> 00:16:07,555
<i>lighting up over</i>
<i>30 different areas</i>

360
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:12,226
and making us forget
how boring Susie Cooper is.

361
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,328
That last one may not
be universal.

362
00:16:14,396 --> 00:16:15,830
How about damage
to her spinal cord

363
00:16:15,897 --> 00:16:18,065
blocking the signals
from her genitals?

364
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,550
Sex drive is in the brain.

365
00:16:19,601 --> 00:16:22,570
<i>I suppose it could be</i>
<i>psychological intimacy issues</i>

366
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:23,971
caused by childhood abuse.

367
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:25,573
She's been sharing a toilet
with the same guy

368
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:26,723
for the last ten years.

369
00:16:26,775 --> 00:16:27,741
That's not the same.

370
00:16:27,826 --> 00:16:29,276
<i>Sex releases oxytocin.</i>

371
00:16:29,361 --> 00:16:31,228
It's the neurochemical basis
for bonding.

372
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,414
And that's why men
always marry their right hands.

373
00:16:33,498 --> 00:16:34,582
It's different for girls.

374
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:35,449
<i>No it's not.</i>

375
00:16:35,534 --> 00:16:37,134
I've tapped over 30 guys

376
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:41,238
and never wanted to see
most of them again.

377
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:44,408
I live next to
a Jewish frat.

378
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,077
We are veering wildly off track.
Please continue.

379
00:16:47,128 --> 00:16:50,130
This woman's life is probably
better off without sex.

380
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:52,349
<i>Eliminates most</i>
<i>of her insecurity,</i>

381
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:54,051
she's immune
to most advertising

382
00:16:54,102 --> 00:16:56,720
and can have honest
relationships with men.

383
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:59,106
Not a lot of them.

384
00:16:59,191 --> 00:17:01,692
We've run every test
and ruled out all the options.

385
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,395
You're gonna have to accept
she just doesn't want sex.

386
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:05,696
Lots of people
don't have sex.

387
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:06,864
The only people
who don't want it

388
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:08,699
are either sick,
dead, or lying.

389
00:17:08,766 --> 00:17:10,484
<i>So maybe she's lying.</i>

390
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,452
You think she's had
a boyfriend on the side?

391
00:17:11,536 --> 00:17:12,887
<i>For ten years?</i>

392
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:17,741
Sticking around the whole time?
Doesn't make sense.

393
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:20,744
What does...

394
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:27,451
30?

395
00:17:27,502 --> 00:17:29,453
Everybody lies.

396
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:35,759
Higher or lower?

397
00:17:40,465 --> 00:17:42,733
Followed your advice
and took the night off.

398
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,984
Seems to have
done you some good.

399
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:45,269
Mm-Hmm.

400
00:17:51,076 --> 00:17:53,810
Where's my husband?

401
00:17:55,447 --> 00:17:56,647
He's not in the hospital.

402
00:17:56,698 --> 00:17:57,998
So he just walked out?

403
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,283
<i>All of the shift nurses</i>

404
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,223
had their hands full
with a double code.

405
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:01,865
Perfectly reasonable explanation.

406
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,358
<i>Same thing happened to me.</i>
<i>Couldn't find my keys for days.</i>

407
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:06,026
The police
have been notified.

408
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:07,878
I have staff searching.

409
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:10,047
You told me
it was okay to leave.

410
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,665
I'm sorry.

411
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,651
He has Alzheimer's!

412
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,387
<i>It's freezing outside,</i>
<i>and he's sick!</i>

413
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,306
I mean, you don't even know
what it is yet, do you?

414
00:18:19,374 --> 00:18:21,392
The plasmapheresis
hasn't had time to work,

415
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,926
but TTP is our
most likely--

416
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:25,813
Okay, I'm just--
I have to go look for him.

417
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,815
<i>Hey, don't be an ass.</i>

418
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,066
<i>Can't you see</i>
<i>she's upset?</i>

419
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,219
No, she's guilty.

420
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,720
'Cause instead of being
at her husband's side,

421
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:36,657
she was under you.

422
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:37,908
Okay, that's--y--

423
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,026
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

424
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:40,778
He already said
I was an ass.

425
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:42,529
Personally, I applaud
your decision

426
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,065
to step down off your cross
and get on with your life,

427
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:47,501
but your misplaced guilt
is shutting down your brain.

428
00:18:47,568 --> 00:18:53,090
We need you to sit, focus,
and answer our questions.

429
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:00,547
So, at 6:00 a.m.,

430
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,849
the patient wakes up,

431
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:05,419
and the first thing
he sees...

432
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,770
In moments of confusion,

433
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:09,523
Alzheimer's patients
regress to old routines.

434
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,726
<i>So what would your husband do</i>
<i>on a Saturday morning?</i>

435
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,761
Nothing. Be at home.

436
00:19:14,813 --> 00:19:16,980
What about a year ago?
Or five years? Ten?

437
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:19,950
I don't know, um, he...

438
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,952
He trained
for a marathon once.

439
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:26,657
<i>Soccer practice.</i>
<i>We took a cooking class.</i>

440
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:28,242
That soccer trophy
you were telling me about.

441
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,660
<i>It's gone.</i>

442
00:19:29,744 --> 00:19:30,944
Where was practice?

443
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:34,581
It was close to here.
On Chesterfield.

444
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:51,631
Okay, he comes, he thinks
he's waiting for practice.

445
00:19:51,683 --> 00:19:53,100
He'd want to get out
of the wind.

446
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,470
What's somewhere he could
see the kids arrive?

447
00:19:56,521 --> 00:19:58,138
There.

448
00:20:00,608 --> 00:20:03,160
Over here.

449
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:13,170
On three.
One, two, three.

450
00:20:17,292 --> 00:20:18,625
Nothing.

451
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,928
Not dead until
he's warm and dead.

452
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:30,686
Get him to the ICU.

453
00:20:30,737 --> 00:20:32,538
Start him on
extracorporeal circulation.

454
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:33,906
That'll raise his
temperature too quickly,

455
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,240
it'll cause acidosis.

456
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:37,076
We can deal with
his metabolism crashing,

457
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,128
we can't reverse brain damage
if we go too slowly.

458
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:41,246
Either way, we don't get his
temperature above 95,

459
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:42,381
it's not going to matter.

460
00:20:42,465 --> 00:20:46,802
Multiple warm lavage
is safer.

461
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:49,221
Do what House says.

462
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,467
He has no heartbeat,
and he's not breathing.

463
00:21:01,534 --> 00:21:04,870
How can he not be dead?

464
00:21:04,938 --> 00:21:07,156
The body slows down
when it cools,

465
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:08,857
but it doesn't fully stop.

466
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:10,693
We're warming his blood
outside of his body,

467
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:11,910
then putting it back.

468
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:13,612
It'll raise his
temperature enough

469
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:15,531
that his heart should
naturally start.

470
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:17,616
Then we can shock it
back into rhythm.

471
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:20,736
And if it doesn't start?

472
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:25,040
Then there's
nothing we can do.

473
00:21:31,014 --> 00:21:34,850
You think it's possible
he knew what he was doing?

474
00:21:34,917 --> 00:21:37,219
Like some part of him gets what
he's putting his wife through,

475
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,937
so he tried to--
kill himself?

476
00:21:39,022 --> 00:21:40,922
It's what I'd do
if I were him.

477
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:43,892
At least I wish I would.

478
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,062
I meant run away.

479
00:21:47,113 --> 00:21:48,731
You think you should
kill yourself

480
00:21:48,782 --> 00:21:51,099
if you become a burden
to the people who love you?

481
00:21:51,151 --> 00:21:53,769
If you really
love them back, then...

482
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,038
Yes.

483
00:21:56,105 --> 00:22:00,209
That's really dark.

484
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:03,495
It's not naive.

485
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,281
I just believe
people are capable

486
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:07,666
of more than you do,
apparently.

487
00:22:09,803 --> 00:22:12,788
We've got brain activity.

488
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,923
Temp's at 93.

489
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:17,459
His heart should
start soon.

490
00:22:19,562 --> 00:22:22,898
My dad left me alone

491
00:22:22,965 --> 00:22:25,651
to care for my alcoholic mom
and raise my baby sister.

492
00:22:25,735 --> 00:22:27,269
<i>I was just a teenager.</i>

493
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,938
I spent half my time
changing diapers

494
00:22:29,989 --> 00:22:33,642
and the other half
cleaning up my mom's vomit.

495
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:35,143
But it must've
been important

496
00:22:35,195 --> 00:22:37,446
that you stayed
for both of them.

497
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:40,532
Mom died after
a few years.

498
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:44,119
It was ugly and painful,
and she went with me hating her.

499
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,488
My sister ended up drinking
half of her life away

500
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:49,208
and hating me because
I couldn't help.

501
00:22:49,292 --> 00:22:52,344
After mom,
I had nothing left.

502
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:56,014
So do I wish mom had used
a gun instead of a bottle?

503
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:57,099
Yes.

504
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:02,137
I--I didn't know.

505
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:04,673
That's why I told you.

506
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:11,847
Ventricular fibrillation.

507
00:23:11,898 --> 00:23:15,117
300 milligrams
amiodarone.

508
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:25,711
Careful.

509
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:27,129
Once we establish rhythm,

510
00:23:27,196 --> 00:23:30,582
any accidental movement
could crash him back into V-fib.

511
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,251
Clear.

512
00:23:41,227 --> 00:23:45,230
We still have
a long way to go.

513
00:23:45,315 --> 00:23:47,182
<i>Cold can be protective</i>
<i>to the brain,</i>

514
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:50,319
but there is
a possibility of damage.

515
00:23:50,386 --> 00:23:51,987
We also need
to confirm and treat

516
00:23:52,054 --> 00:23:54,356
whatever's
making him sick.

517
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,077
I just gotta do
a standard battery of tests.

518
00:23:59,162 --> 00:24:01,246
<i>Blood, urine, eeg...</i>

519
00:24:01,331 --> 00:24:03,916
Is that really necessary
for a free flu shot?

520
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:07,753
Excuse me.

521
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:12,207
I have to deal with someone
who's having a panic attack.

522
00:24:17,096 --> 00:24:18,931
I specifically said

523
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:21,633
the bet was off if you
contacted the patient.

524
00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:22,918
Exactly.

525
00:24:22,969 --> 00:24:24,803
Never said anything
about the patient's husband.

526
00:24:24,888 --> 00:24:29,057
The deal was a medical reason
why she doesn't have sex.

527
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:30,776
I admit I was stuck,

528
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,196
until I realized the medical
issue was not hers but his.

529
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:35,731
She's lying
to compensate.

530
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:37,766
It's a tale
as old as time.

531
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:39,818
Boy meets girl,
girl falls for boy,

532
00:24:39,903 --> 00:24:44,623
boy says, "I'm asexual."
Girl says, "yeah, me too."

533
00:24:44,707 --> 00:24:47,376
Your twisted logic
can't hide the fact

534
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:49,328
that tricking a patient
into being tested

535
00:24:49,412 --> 00:24:50,796
is completely
unethical.

536
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,281
Come on.

537
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,083
Don't you think she deserves
to know why her husband

538
00:24:55,134 --> 00:24:57,285
won't bend her over
the kitchen counter?

539
00:24:57,337 --> 00:24:59,621
You love all that
caring crap.

540
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:01,390
You're not doing this out of
the kindness of your heart.

541
00:25:01,457 --> 00:25:03,675
You're not even doing this
out of medical curiosity.

542
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,061
I thought I made it clear
I'm doing it for the cash.

543
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:07,479
Two people are happy,

544
00:25:07,563 --> 00:25:09,297
and your natural impulse
is to destroy it.

545
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:10,265
How do you know
she's happy?

546
00:25:10,316 --> 00:25:11,800
Did she tell you?

547
00:25:11,851 --> 00:25:15,270
No, chirping birds flew out
of her butt carrying a banner.

548
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:17,105
All right, I admit
that my natural impulse

549
00:25:17,156 --> 00:25:18,991
is to doubt peoples'
claims to happiness,

550
00:25:19,075 --> 00:25:21,576
but yours is to be
a sucker for them.

551
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:25,497
You tell me
which one's worse.

552
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:35,257
He just opened his eyes
a little while ago.

553
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:37,175
His heartbeat's doing well,

554
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,095
and his body temperature
is stabilized.

555
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:53,642
There he is.

556
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:55,410
<i>Me sinto quente.</i>

557
00:25:55,478 --> 00:25:57,112
Is that Portuguese?

558
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:00,565
Yeah.

559
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,868
Honey, I don't
understand.

560
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:06,288
<i>Me sinto quente.</i>

561
00:26:06,355 --> 00:26:09,357
What's he saying?

562
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:11,994
I don't know.

563
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:13,657
I tried to learn
when we got married,

564
00:26:13,658 --> 00:26:14,858
but I just--

565
00:26:18,551 --> 00:26:20,886
it's okay. It's okay.

566
00:26:24,223 --> 00:26:25,340
<i>His body temperature</i>
<i>is rising.</i>

567
00:26:25,391 --> 00:26:27,476
It's above normal.

568
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:28,727
Wait, I thought--

569
00:26:28,811 --> 00:26:30,062
I thought you said
it was stable.

570
00:26:30,146 --> 00:26:31,396
Why is it still rising?

571
00:26:31,481 --> 00:26:32,514
I don't know.

572
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:37,812
Vomiting, liver,
kidneys, and now fever.

573
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:42,784
I don't want to tell you
how to do your job, Dr. Foreman,

574
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:45,453
since telling people
how to do their job is your job,

575
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:47,455
but when your

576
00:26:47,506 --> 00:26:49,591
less-than-competent
administration of this hospital

577
00:26:49,658 --> 00:26:51,209
affects what's written
on my whiteboard...

578
00:26:51,294 --> 00:26:52,294
Get to the point.

579
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,129
The word "fever."

580
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,547
Could come from
the patient's illness,

581
00:26:55,631 --> 00:26:57,015
or it could come from the fact
that you allowed him

582
00:26:57,099 --> 00:26:59,718
to saunter out of your hospital
and take a nap in the snow.

583
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:01,770
Couldn't have caught a virus
while he was outside.

584
00:27:01,837 --> 00:27:03,838
Fever came on too fast.

585
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:08,310
The hypothermia could've
caused cell necrosis.

586
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:10,528
TTP was the diagnosis
when he walked out.

587
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:13,148
Fever's a little high,
but it still fits.

588
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,700
We should continue
plasmapheresis.

589
00:27:15,785 --> 00:27:17,352
We're missing symptoms.

590
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,237
We should add language loss
and aggression.

591
00:27:19,322 --> 00:27:20,705
<i>Should we also</i>
<i>add forgetfulness?</i>

592
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,457
- He's got Alzheimer's.
- We've just been assuming.

593
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:24,042
Because the patient's wife

594
00:27:24,126 --> 00:27:25,243
said he exhibited
both for a year.

595
00:27:25,328 --> 00:27:26,911
He's never hit her before

596
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:28,079
or lost all his English.

597
00:27:28,164 --> 00:27:29,697
We have to consider
any change

598
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:30,632
since he's been admitted
as relevant.

599
00:27:30,699 --> 00:27:31,833
Have to?

600
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,369
Do I need to pull out
another card?

601
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,555
Disseminated viral infection
with encephalitis.

602
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,378
<i>Patient complained of</i>
<i>a sore throat a few weeks ago.</i>

603
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:48,316
Start him on Interferon.

604
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:52,937
<i>Encephalitis makes</i>
<i>his brain swell,</i>

605
00:27:53,022 --> 00:27:54,189
which causes symptoms
that are

606
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,907
hard to distinguish
from his Alzheimer's.

607
00:27:55,992 --> 00:27:59,110
With the Interferon
his English should come back,

608
00:27:59,195 --> 00:28:00,912
and the aggression
should subside.

609
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:02,664
But you're not sure.

610
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:05,083
Unfortunately, no.

611
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:09,738
And you're not sure if he has
brain damage from being frozen.

612
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:17,078
So best-case scenario,

613
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:22,100
I've just had a glimpse
into his future?

614
00:28:25,354 --> 00:28:27,088
I can't take care
of him anymore.

615
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,107
<i>Chances are his mental state</i>
<i>will improve.</i>

616
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:31,726
You could get
more time with him.

617
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:35,730
We married six months
after I met him.

618
00:28:35,781 --> 00:28:40,618
A year after that,
he started forgetting things.

619
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:43,121
I've known my husband
longer with his Alzheimer's

620
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:44,322
than without.

621
00:28:44,407 --> 00:28:46,074
I've watched
more of him disappear

622
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:48,877
than I ever got to know.

623
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:52,714
I just can't
do this anymore.

624
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,337
You lose.

625
00:28:59,422 --> 00:29:03,475
Blood work shows
high levels of prolactin.

626
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,428
Add that to some peripheral
red-green confusion,

627
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:08,847
puts my money--
excuse me, your money--

628
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:10,298
soon to be my money

629
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,600
<i>on a tumor</i>
<i>near his pituitary.</i>

630
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:15,170
Probably started growing
in his early teens.

631
00:29:15,237 --> 00:29:16,637
Lowering his libido

632
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:19,023
and causing
erectile dysfunction.

633
00:29:19,108 --> 00:29:20,992
<i>A year on</i>
<i>dopamine agonists,</i>

634
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:23,628
and he'll be a sex-crazed creep
just like the rest of us,

635
00:29:23,696 --> 00:29:27,332
completely fascinated
by Susie Cooper.

636
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:30,618
I'd prefer to be paid
in a single $100 bill.

637
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:32,820
Always wanted to use one
to light a cigar.

638
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:37,759
Hooray for us.
We disproved his asexuality.

639
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:39,594
We also probably
ruined his life.

640
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:40,545
<i>He'll thank us.</i>

641
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:42,347
Then he'll doze off,

642
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:45,016
and then in a couple hours,
he'll thank us again.

643
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:47,168
It could destroy
his identity.

644
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:50,221
It's like a gay person being
told they're really straight.

645
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:52,107
So don't tell him.

646
00:29:52,174 --> 00:29:53,308
Yeah, why bother
telling a guy

647
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,859
he has a tumor
growing in his head?

648
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:57,145
He'll notice it eventually, when
it starts leaking out his ears.

649
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:58,813
<i>It's a slow-growing tumor.</i>

650
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:02,317
He'll probably die
of boredom long before that.

651
00:30:02,368 --> 00:30:03,518
You always do this.

652
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:05,286
You--you meddle

653
00:30:05,354 --> 00:30:08,656
and force me into
impossible situations.

654
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:10,408
You knew the second
you told me about this case

655
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:12,160
that I'd get involved.

656
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:13,328
You wanted me to meddle.

657
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:15,380
Because no matter
how much you wanted

658
00:30:15,464 --> 00:30:17,248
to believe in this
chaste romance,

659
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:19,801
you didn't
buy it either.

660
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:21,686
Where's that petition
House's P.O. sent over

661
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:23,888
about getting his
ankle monitor off?

662
00:30:23,973 --> 00:30:26,040
On your desk.

663
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,859
You played me.

664
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,495
This whole thing was about
your ankle monitor.

665
00:30:47,563 --> 00:30:50,248
You weren't trying
to undermine my confidence,

666
00:30:50,332 --> 00:30:51,583
you were trying
to inflate it.

667
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,734
You manufactured
conflict with me

668
00:30:53,786 --> 00:30:55,286
so eventually
you could let me win.

669
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,956
You knew it was encephalitis,
but you waited for me to say it

670
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,958
because then
with my ego boosted,

671
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:01,459
you thought I'd be in the mood
to take off your monitor

672
00:31:01,544 --> 00:31:05,630
because I'd think
I could control you.

673
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:11,219
You're right.
Take off my monitor.

674
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,471
See, the beauty
of the plan

675
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:15,890
is that if it works,
you think you can control me.

676
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:19,777
If it fails, then you will
actually have proven

677
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:21,896
that you can control me.

678
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,566
It's pretty genius.

679
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:27,535
These are your
training wheels.

680
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:29,103
If you think
you're up to this job,

681
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:31,539
it's time to lose them.

682
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,288
Second half of my plan
might need work.

683
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:59,133
V-fib. Two rounds of 360
without establishing a rhythm.

684
00:32:01,403 --> 00:32:05,607
Wait, Dr. Foreman!

685
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:06,991
Clear.

686
00:32:11,747 --> 00:32:13,781
He's back.

687
00:32:25,322 --> 00:32:27,362
I sure hope this
Alzheimer's drug trial

688
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:28,697
is worth a lot
to this hospital,

689
00:32:28,748 --> 00:32:30,448
'cause we're wasting a crap-load
of time and manpower

690
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,067
just to let this guy
watch his mind shrivel

691
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,619
and keep his wife
miserable.

692
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,737
Heart attack
while he was on Interferon

693
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,155
rules out encephalitis,

694
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:40,041
but I still think I'm right
about the neural symptoms.

695
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:41,426
It's probably
aseptic meningitis.

696
00:32:41,494 --> 00:32:42,877
Would have seen
meningial signs.

697
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:44,929
Given his abnormal
mental status, not necessarily.

698
00:32:45,014 --> 00:32:46,131
<i>Dr. Foreman,</i>

699
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:49,384
would you please
reach under your chair?

700
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:56,141
There's just wet gum under here.
Where's the card?

701
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:59,761
What card?

702
00:32:59,812 --> 00:33:01,062
I'm happy to leave
if you have

703
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:03,481
<i>a better theory</i>
<i>than aseptic meningitis.</i>

704
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:04,733
Toxins.

705
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:05,984
This guy went
on walkabout.

706
00:33:06,068 --> 00:33:07,819
<i>Chances are</i>
<i>he's done it before.</i>

707
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,120
Wife keeps the doors
on the house locked.

708
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:10,605
Plenty of nasty stuff
to get into

709
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,706
during the middle
of the night.

710
00:33:11,774 --> 00:33:12,940
We asked about toxins
on the history.

711
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:14,292
The wife said she was
sure to clear the house

712
00:33:14,377 --> 00:33:15,377
for her husband's safety.

713
00:33:15,444 --> 00:33:16,778
I'm sure she succeeded.

714
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,781
She's a PhD
in toxicology, right?

715
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,132
She's an ex-florist.

716
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,434
Search the home
for toxic plants,

717
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,670
methyl bromide,
any medications.

718
00:33:25,755 --> 00:33:27,955
Stop.

719
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,058
You're not infallible. You were
wrong about encephalitis.

720
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,009
Just before you were.

721
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:32,394
Run CSF tests.

722
00:33:32,461 --> 00:33:34,646
<i>Find out what's</i>
<i>causing the meningitis.</i>

723
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:38,733
You said you weren't gonna
overrule me diagnostically.

724
00:33:38,801 --> 00:33:40,819
And you said I wouldn't
be able to help it.

725
00:33:40,903 --> 00:33:43,571
Apparently, you were
right about that one.

726
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,441
<i>Fine.</i>

727
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,493
I'll look
for toxins myself.

728
00:33:48,577 --> 00:33:50,311
You can't go to their house
without Foreman's permission.

729
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,646
Don't need it.

730
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:54,215
I'll talk to
the toxicology PhD upstairs.

731
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:56,384
<i>What about gifts</i>
<i>from South America?</i>

732
00:33:56,452 --> 00:33:58,903
Anyone send any fruits
or vegetables?

733
00:33:58,971 --> 00:34:01,339
I don't think so, no.

734
00:34:01,424 --> 00:34:04,626
<i>Barraco azul...</i>

735
00:34:04,677 --> 00:34:06,294
I'm gonna need
your boyfriend

736
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:08,279
<i>to collect samples</i>
<i>of plants</i>

737
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,765
in and around your house.
Toxins are the most...

738
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:12,884
<i>Barraco azul...</i>

739
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:16,271
<i>O que e isso?</i>
<i>Barraco azul?</i>

740
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:19,057
Wait,
you understand him?

741
00:34:19,141 --> 00:34:22,844
What's he saying?

742
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:25,730
He's--he's repeating,
"blue shack."

743
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:27,649
You know what that is?

744
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,034
Is it somewhere where
pesticides may be kept?

745
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:35,974
It's where we had
our first date.

746
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:39,360
Do you have a cleaning lady

747
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:42,330
who might bring
her own supplies?

748
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,798
What's he saying?

749
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:46,584
If it's not relevant
to the case, I don't care.

750
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,669
And neither should you.

751
00:34:47,691 --> 00:34:49,192
Please.

752
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:53,196
This might be the last time
I ever know what he's thinking.

753
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:03,239
When I saw her waiting...

754
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:08,911
Waiting for me
at the table...

755
00:35:08,962 --> 00:35:12,448
The way her eyes looked
when she smiled...

756
00:35:14,885 --> 00:35:18,554
I felt like crying.

757
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:25,728
I knew that she was
the woman I wanted to marry.

758
00:35:25,795 --> 00:35:29,181
Every time I see her,
I say...

759
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:32,318
<i>La esta ela.</i>

760
00:35:32,402 --> 00:35:34,437
There she is.
There she is.

761
00:35:39,976 --> 00:35:42,578
He's still in there.

762
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:44,614
<i>Quem e ela?</i>

763
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:50,419
What did he say?

764
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:53,256
He asked who you were.

765
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:59,295
Don't get your hopes up.

766
00:35:59,346 --> 00:36:02,848
Have your boyfriend
give me those samples.

767
00:36:11,391 --> 00:36:14,610
How'd you even know
to look for a tumor?

768
00:36:14,678 --> 00:36:18,898
Well, Dr. House noticed hormone
levels in your blood,

769
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:21,534
and consulted me
as an oncologist.

770
00:36:21,618 --> 00:36:23,986
Who cares how they found it,
okay? They found it.

771
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:25,788
Are there any side effects
to the treatment?

772
00:36:25,855 --> 00:36:30,793
Some nausea, dizziness,
and as the tumor shrinks,

773
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,962
there will be
behavioral changes.

774
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:34,063
Like what?

775
00:36:34,131 --> 00:36:37,049
Well...

776
00:36:37,134 --> 00:36:40,636
The tumor interferes
with certain natural systems.

777
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:44,340
Um...

778
00:36:44,391 --> 00:36:48,644
It lowers libido and causes
erectile dysfunction.

779
00:36:48,712 --> 00:36:50,396
Eh...

780
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,648
Y-you mean
the treatment will,

781
00:36:52,716 --> 00:36:53,599
um...

782
00:36:53,684 --> 00:36:57,219
M-make me want
to have sex?

783
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,555
Wh-what if I don't
want the treatment?

784
00:36:59,606 --> 00:37:01,157
I would strongly advise...

785
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:03,242
You have a brain tumor, okay?
You have to have the treatment.

786
00:37:03,327 --> 00:37:05,411
Okay, look,
I know who I am, okay?

787
00:37:05,495 --> 00:37:07,279
And I'm not one of them.

788
00:37:07,364 --> 00:37:10,866
Hey, look, we'll adjust.
Okay?

789
00:37:10,917 --> 00:37:13,369
We can go through
this together.

790
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,338
You mean have sex?

791
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:16,872
I can't make you do that.

792
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:18,907
Maybe it won't be so bad.

793
00:37:18,959 --> 00:37:22,878
It'll be terrible.

794
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:25,564
It's actually pretty fun.

795
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:30,553
From what I remember.

796
00:37:30,604 --> 00:37:33,022
But you said that...
I know.

797
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:38,310
I know. I wanted to spend
my life with you.

798
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:42,448
And I knew that meant
making certain sacrifices.

799
00:37:42,532 --> 00:37:45,284
But a girl has needs.

800
00:37:50,507 --> 00:37:52,708
You dropped in
the U.S. News rankings.

801
00:37:52,776 --> 00:37:54,243
With respect,
Mr. Laffont,

802
00:37:54,311 --> 00:37:56,328
that's only because
we temporarily shut down

803
00:37:56,413 --> 00:37:57,546
our Diagnostics Department.

804
00:37:57,614 --> 00:37:58,998
It's up and running again.

805
00:37:59,082 --> 00:38:00,132
I'm actually concerned
it might be

806
00:38:00,217 --> 00:38:01,467
because of the change
in management.

807
00:38:01,551 --> 00:38:03,285
<i>If you want my money,</i>

808
00:38:03,336 --> 00:38:05,521
<i>I'll need</i>
<i>to see a five-year plan.</i>

809
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:12,762
Am I boring you?

810
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:14,597
No, no, I just...

811
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:18,300
Those flowers
are from last week.

812
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,236
They should be
dead by now.

813
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:21,404
Excuse me?

814
00:38:24,524 --> 00:38:26,158
Sorry. I have to go.

815
00:38:37,823 --> 00:38:39,424
It's Reye's syndrome.

816
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:40,792
Patient had
a sore throat

817
00:38:40,843 --> 00:38:42,260
a few weeks ago
before he was admitted.

818
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:44,495
Reye's in adults
is a reach.

819
00:38:44,547 --> 00:38:45,880
Not if he took aspirin.

820
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:48,016
Aspirin in adults
is a reach.

821
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,334
Especially in a house
with locked medicine cabinets.

822
00:38:50,386 --> 00:38:51,686
Wasn't in
the medicine cabinet.

823
00:38:51,771 --> 00:38:54,105
Wife used to run
a floral company.

824
00:38:54,173 --> 00:38:55,690
Still does a few
orders from home.

825
00:38:55,775 --> 00:38:57,726
She uses crushed aspirin
in the water

826
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:01,613
to make the flowers
last longer.

827
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,398
So the husband
has a sore throat,

828
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,150
takes an aspirin
without her knowing,

829
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:07,118
realizes he's got a sore throat,
takes an aspirin,

830
00:39:07,186 --> 00:39:08,486
realizes he's got
a sore throat...

831
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:11,156
Stop me whenever you like.

832
00:39:11,207 --> 00:39:14,209
Have Chase start him
on steroids.

833
00:39:14,293 --> 00:39:15,960
Already did.

834
00:39:16,028 --> 00:39:18,029
Then why're you
telling me?

835
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,966
'Cause I wanted you
to hear it from me.

836
00:39:44,356 --> 00:39:48,076
Oh...

837
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:53,231
There she is.

838
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:57,836
Here I am.

839
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,256
Your eye.

840
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,542
What happened?

841
00:40:04,593 --> 00:40:08,329
It's nothing
I can't handle.

842
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:24,562
MRI confirmed
macroprolactinoma.

843
00:40:24,613 --> 00:40:26,698
He's doing the treatment.

844
00:40:26,765 --> 00:40:28,032
And the wife?

845
00:40:35,407 --> 00:40:36,875
Come on.

846
00:40:36,942 --> 00:40:40,378
<i>You saved a man's life.</i>

847
00:40:40,445 --> 00:40:43,948
Course-corrected two peoples'
wildly screwed-up world views.

848
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:49,921
It's not bad
for a day's work.

849
00:40:49,972 --> 00:40:52,590
I think they were happy.

850
00:40:52,641 --> 00:40:54,642
<i>Even if it was</i>
<i>based on lies.</i>

851
00:40:54,727 --> 00:40:56,394
Most happiness is.

852
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:01,232
Better to have
schtupped and lost

853
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,984
then never to have
schtupped at all.

854
00:41:03,068 --> 00:41:05,737
We can't smoke in here.

855
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:11,976
We also can't summon
people into the clinic

856
00:41:12,027 --> 00:41:13,945
based on a lie
motivated by a petty bet.

857
00:41:13,996 --> 00:41:16,080
And yet it happens.

858
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:17,916
It's an imperfect world.

859
00:41:29,595 --> 00:41:30,511
Well?

860
00:41:30,596 --> 00:41:35,550
