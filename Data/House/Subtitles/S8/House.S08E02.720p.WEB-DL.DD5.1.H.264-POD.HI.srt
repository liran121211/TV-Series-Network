00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:15,285
We're going to the cath lab?

538
00:25:15,353 --> 00:25:16,387
Are you thinking
that maybe--

539
00:25:16,455 --> 00:25:17,788
what?
Who?

540
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:20,591
One dead lobe means
four alive ones.

541
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:21,960
It means
enough to transplant

542
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:25,297
with a side order of dead tissue
that we can test.

543
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:28,969
It makes sense.
Unlike you stealing my phone.

544
00:25:29,036 --> 00:25:30,704
You have
unlimited texting.

545
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:33,240
Until your parents know,
you will never see that punch

546
00:25:33,307 --> 00:25:34,308
for what it really was.

547
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:37,944
Your February 4th.

548
00:25:38,012 --> 00:25:39,446
Sri Lankan
Independence Day.

549
00:25:39,513 --> 00:25:41,480
I told you
I'm Korean and Filipino.

550
00:25:41,548 --> 00:25:43,516
And I told you
I wasn't listening.

551
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,917
By my actions.

552
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:47,586
Violence isn't an appropriate
way to handle conflict.

553
00:25:47,654 --> 00:25:49,487
It was a moment
of weakness.

554
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:50,722
You barked at me,
picked a fight

555
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:52,156
with a painting crew.

556
00:25:52,224 --> 00:25:53,157
Maybe it's time
to recognize

557
00:25:53,225 --> 00:25:54,759
it's not a character flaw.

558
00:25:54,826 --> 00:25:56,660
Maybe it's your character.

559
00:25:56,728 --> 00:25:58,496
- Pinto!
- House.

560
00:26:04,202 --> 00:26:05,502
Embrace your inner bitch.

561
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,737
[Door opens]

562
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:13,477
So why did chelation
make the lungs worse?

563
00:26:13,544 --> 00:26:16,080
We got about five minutes
till pinto gets back.

564
00:26:16,147 --> 00:26:17,481
- Give me a hand with this.
- No.

565
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:20,385
I tracked down
another bag of plasma

566
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:21,619
from the batch
they used on the donor.

567
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:25,056
Negative
for all our other exposures.

568
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:27,626
Sarcoidosis
could be inflamed

569
00:26:27,694 --> 00:26:29,628
by the treatment.

570
00:26:29,696 --> 00:26:31,230
I am a cripple

571
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,999
in need of assistance.

572
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:37,269
Transplant team
ran an A.C.E.

573
00:26:37,337 --> 00:26:38,570
- Negative.
- <i>It's mine.</i>

574
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,171
And it's your job.

575
00:26:40,239 --> 00:26:42,173
My job is to assist you
in curing the lungs.

576
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:46,177
This chair will help me
do that.

577
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:48,415
What if the scrapings
from the bridge

578
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,950
contains other heavy metals,
like beryllium, or uh, asbestos.

579
00:26:52,952 --> 00:26:55,719
Chelation for lead
wouldn't have made them worse.

580
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:56,944
(chair bumps against door-frame)

581
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:05,231
But...

582
00:27:05,298 --> 00:27:08,501
Maybe the problem isn't
a heavy metal from outside.

583
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:09,970
It's inside.

584
00:27:10,037 --> 00:27:11,639
But it's not leaving the body
like it's supposed to.

585
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:14,041
It's stuck.

586
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:15,910
Iron.

587
00:27:15,977 --> 00:27:17,545
The donor had hemosiderosis.

588
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:19,413
His body wasn't disposing
of iron.

589
00:27:19,481 --> 00:27:21,782
Massive amounts
choke up the lungs.

590
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,985
Then our chelation
would wreak havoc

591
00:27:24,052 --> 00:27:25,319
because it picks up
too much stuff.

592
00:27:25,387 --> 00:27:27,388
Go stain the dead lung tissue
for iron.

593
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:33,628
I'm sorry, young lady,
I simply will not help you

594
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,536
steal this chair.

595
00:27:36,818 --> 00:27:38,348
- Pinto.
- House.

596
00:27:42,404 --> 00:27:44,005
Hi.

597
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:48,509
She can barely
catch her breath.

598
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:54,948
Lungs ready yet?

599
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:56,582
We're testing
for iron overload.

600
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,950
I thought it was lead.

601
00:27:58,018 --> 00:28:00,219
This is not an exact process.

602
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:04,289
Your small airways
are collapsing.

603
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:08,226
You're not getting
enough oxygen.

604
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:09,594
I'd like to try forcing

605
00:28:09,662 --> 00:28:11,929
an oxygen-rich slurry
into your lungs.

606
00:28:11,997 --> 00:28:14,232
It should open up the airways
and buy you some time

607
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,166
until the lungs are ready.

608
00:28:18,237 --> 00:28:20,205
Fluid?
In my lungs?

609
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,773
Sounds like drowning.

610
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:27,712
It is.

611
00:28:32,221 --> 00:28:34,822
Gonna hurt,
isn't it?

612
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:38,993
Yes.
A fair amount.

613
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:46,000
No.

614
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:48,169
I'm done.

615
00:28:53,543 --> 00:28:56,378
[Knock at door]

616
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:58,346
<i>(Wilson) House, the nurses</i>
<i>saw you come in.</i>

617
00:28:58,414 --> 00:29:00,949
Enter.

618
00:29:01,016 --> 00:29:02,751
<i>It's a bathroom.</i>

619
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:05,420
Ah, explains the hole
in this chair.

620
00:29:11,895 --> 00:29:15,163
God, I missed doors.

621
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:17,032
And air freshener.

622
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:20,769
Now go away.

623
00:29:20,837 --> 00:29:23,105
I'm waiting
for some test results.

624
00:29:23,173 --> 00:29:25,407
My patient signed a DNR.
She's giving up.

625
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:28,142
Looks like someone else
will be getting the lungs.

626
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,875
Making this yet another
interaction with you

627
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,100
in which I get nothing.

628
00:29:32,113 --> 00:29:34,180
It's not my fault
you can't handle your patient.

629
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:36,950
She said she's done.

630
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:38,752
I spent half an hour
trying to change her mind,

631
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,987
but she'd made her decision.

632
00:29:40,055 --> 00:29:41,823
I accepted that.
It's called respect.

633
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,691
Well, what's after respect?

634
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:45,861
<i>You find</i>
<i>another angle.</i>

635
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:47,062
<i>You hold her hand,</i>

636
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,098
get the sister
to beg,

637
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:50,366
stick your fingers
in your ears,

638
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:52,002
pretend you can't hear.

639
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,171
You do whatever it takes.

640
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:55,505
Oh, whatever it takes.

641
00:29:55,573 --> 00:29:56,506
Thanks, House.

642
00:29:56,574 --> 00:29:58,809
I hadn't thought
of that.

643
00:30:08,855 --> 00:30:11,489
[Door opens]

644
00:30:11,557 --> 00:30:12,624
What are you testing for?

645
00:30:12,691 --> 00:30:14,192
Hemosiderosis.

646
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,294
I'm staining
for excess iron.

647
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:18,596
Promising.

648
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:21,532
When your dad showed up
unexpectedly,

649
00:30:22,127 --> 00:30:23,760
House have a hand in that?

650
00:30:23,932 --> 00:30:25,864
I'm guessing he does things
like that a lot.

651
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,835
His version of a compliment.

652
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:33,476
I spoke to the head
of neurology in Chicago.

653
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:35,145
I gave you
a good recommendation.

654
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:36,980
Did you mention
what happened?

655
00:30:37,048 --> 00:30:39,483
Lawyers say
I'm not allowed to.

656
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:42,286
It works out well
for everyone.

657
00:30:45,156 --> 00:30:47,291
Why exactly
is that good for you?

658
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:48,826
Excuse me?

659
00:30:48,894 --> 00:30:51,495
I'm a talented physician,
top 2% of my class.

660
00:30:51,563 --> 00:30:53,097
I'm an asset to this hospital,

661
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:54,632
an asset you're about to lose
to Chicago.

662
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,167
You applied
for the job.

663
00:30:56,234 --> 00:30:58,236
You asked me to call
and recommend you.

664
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,270
Andrews is the one
that should leave.

665
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:00,371
He's the supervisor.

666
00:31:00,439 --> 00:31:01,973
He touched me first.

667
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,241
I can't discuss
any of that,

668
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:05,977
not before the hearing.

669
00:31:06,044 --> 00:31:08,079
But if you're having doubts
about Chicago,

670
00:31:08,147 --> 00:31:09,213
I can call them back.

671
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:14,218
No. Thank you.

672
00:31:18,557 --> 00:31:19,757
Dr. Foreman?

673
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:21,959
<i>Would you look at this?</i>

674
00:31:22,027 --> 00:31:24,161
Iron?

675
00:31:24,229 --> 00:31:25,162
<i>No.</i>

676
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:27,697
<i>White blood cells.</i>

677
00:31:27,765 --> 00:31:30,699
Classic presentation
of infection.

678
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:32,367
How the hell
did we miss that?

679
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:40,895
Biopsy revealed,
white blood cell inflitrate.

680
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:44,092
Infection was right, after all.

681
00:31:46,977 --> 00:31:49,079
Fresh fruit in prison
is usually chicken.

682
00:31:49,146 --> 00:31:50,480
Why aren't you
more alarmed?

683
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:51,614
We're running
out of time.

684
00:31:51,682 --> 00:31:53,283
Aahh, she's dying!

685
00:31:55,252 --> 00:31:56,919
Were you able to figure out
what was wrong

686
00:31:56,987 --> 00:31:57,987
while I was screaming?

687
00:31:58,055 --> 00:32:00,423
Infection was the first thing

688
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:02,092
that the transplant team
treated for.

689
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,393
Which would have worked

690
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:04,961
if the bacteria
had been out in the open.

691
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:06,930
If they're hiding
inside the lung cells...

692
00:32:06,998 --> 00:32:09,299
I'm thinking brucella.

693
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:12,303
And to wipe that out,
you need special ops.

694
00:32:13,805 --> 00:32:15,440
An intact immune system.

695
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:19,077
But that's
what white blood cells are.

696
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,179
They're part
of the immune defense force,

697
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:22,648
like the infantry.

698
00:32:22,715 --> 00:32:26,385
But those lungs need
the Air Force and the Marines,

699
00:32:26,453 --> 00:32:30,656
antibodies raining down
from above.

700
00:32:30,724 --> 00:32:33,659
Antibiotics
and IVIG.

701
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:38,531
Did you use metaphors
for your old team?

702
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:41,833
Or do you just think
I'm particularly stupid?

703
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:44,937
No,
they were stupid too.

704
00:32:54,947 --> 00:32:56,948
What are you doing here?

705
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,650
I'm here
for Vanessa.

706
00:32:59,718 --> 00:33:01,586
Now is not the time,
Bobby.

707
00:33:01,653 --> 00:33:03,354
She asked me
to come.

708
00:33:03,422 --> 00:33:05,523
Right, Doc?

709
00:33:05,591 --> 00:33:08,626
Actually,
it was my idea.

710
00:33:08,694 --> 00:33:10,229
What?
What were you thinking?

711
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:11,296
She doesn't want
to see him.

712
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,330
When Vanessa was ready
to quit chemo,

713
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:14,132
Bobby's the one

714
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,400
<i>who got her</i>
<i>to do one more round.</i>

715
00:33:15,468 --> 00:33:17,770
Yeah,
