1
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,598
Good afternoon, Cedarville!

2
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:29,505
It is my distinct honor
to present

3
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:32,238
our annual
community service award

4
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:34,758
to one of our most
outstanding citizens.

5
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:38,346
Now, many of you
may recognize him

6
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:42,083
as coach Bob of our champion
little league team.

7
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:43,986
And some of you may know him

8
00:00:44,053 --> 00:00:47,856
as the treasurer
of our harvest scholarship fund.

9
00:00:47,924 --> 00:00:51,159
<i>But I know that all of you
know him as the guy</i>

10
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,128
that owns the only
gas station in town.

11
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:56,197
<i>Bob Harris, get on up here</i>

12
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,067
<i>with that beautiful family
of yours!</i>

13
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:04,372
Bob Harris, folks!

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,308
Bob, your community activism,

15
00:01:07,376 --> 00:01:08,844
<i>charity work,</i>

16
00:01:08,912 --> 00:01:12,614
and character represent the
finest Cedarville has to offer.

17
00:01:12,682 --> 00:01:15,116
<i>Please accept this
on behalf of all of us</i>

18
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:16,317
and know that we love you.

19
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,553
Are you all right?

20
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:52,854
<i>Bob?</i>

21
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:00,295
You're crushing me!

22
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:03,765
Wake up!

23
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,570
I think you're having
a heart attack.

24
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:11,272
I'm gonna call the ambulance!

25
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,410
No. Just drive me
to the hospital.

26
00:02:24,943 --> 00:02:35,857

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

27
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:50,679
As the new dean of medicine,

28
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:52,881
I'd like to personally welcome
all of our new employees

29
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:55,350
and ask, why the hell
do you want to come back?

30
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:59,054
Tired of surfing.

31
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:00,722
He hasn't changed.

32
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,758
And neither has the job, right?

33
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:04,225
We still get to do crazy crap?

34
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:07,095
Save people's lives
instead of just their noses?

35
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,597
About that...
About the crazy stuff?

36
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,299
<i>Here we go.</i>

37
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:12,734
He's gone from ally to enemy.

38
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:15,570
He has no choice.
He's the boss now.

39
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:16,905
He has to be professional.

40
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,740
He has to base his decisions

41
00:03:18,808 --> 00:03:20,008
on what's best
for the entire hospital.

42
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:21,376
<i>We can't take it personally.</i>

43
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:23,311
Couldn't have said it
better myself.

44
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:24,746
<i>You did.</i>

45
00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:26,114
I'm just reading
the notes on your desk.

46
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,985
He also wants us
to spy for him.

47
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:31,619
<i>Not spy.</i>

48
00:03:31,688 --> 00:03:33,521
I'm trying to keep House
out of prison.

49
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,657
To do that, I need to know
what he's doing and planning.

50
00:03:35,725 --> 00:03:36,792
Spy.
Spy.

51
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:40,028
Come on, guys.
I am your boss.

52
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,130
You do have to treat me
appropriately.

53
00:03:42,198 --> 00:03:45,867
But it doesn't have to be
awkward and weird.

54
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,869
Outside of work,
I still consider us all friends.

55
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:48,904
<i>I'm glad you feel that way,</i>

56
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:50,505
because I do have
a favor to ask.

57
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:52,040
I told House I couldn't come
back until next week.

58
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:54,409
He said he understood completely
and that I was fired.

59
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:57,779
So...

60
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:03,118
Since I have my kids
for the next two days,

61
00:04:03,186 --> 00:04:04,352
I need a babysitter.

62
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,088
No!

63
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:11,259
Male patient
went into v-fib

64
00:04:11,327 --> 00:04:13,061
but shows no signs
of heart disease

65
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:16,164
or any other symptoms,
for that matter.

66
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:18,466
What was he doing

67
00:04:18,534 --> 00:04:20,102
when his heart decided
to do the mambo?

68
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:22,104
He said he was at work.

69
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:30,112
You're late.

70
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:31,346
According to my calendar,
I'm a week early.

71
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,948
Beard's a nice touch.

72
00:04:33,015 --> 00:04:36,618
<i>Lets everyone know that
you're not a teenage girl.</i>

73
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:41,556
Oh, now, you two
make a cute couple.

74
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:43,691
And you two...

75
00:04:46,462 --> 00:04:47,695
It's not important.

76
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:49,998
Dr. Park.

77
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:53,301
You're a lot taller
than I thought you'd be.

78
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:54,930
And I look forward
to working with you as well.

79
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,372
He's lying, not just Taub-the patient.

80
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,311
<i>These abrasions
on his knees-</i>

81
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,743
they're minty fresh...

82
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:02,549
About ten hours old.

83
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,060
He got them
playing flag football.

84
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,981
He said he got them
playing flag football.

85
00:05:06,049 --> 00:05:08,845
I'm sure that's true if "flag"
is a euphemism for "penis"

86
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:11,100
and "football" is a euphemism
for "entering a vagina."

87
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:12,842
Why lie about it?

88
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,910
Everybody lies.

89
00:05:13,978 --> 00:05:15,411
<i>Speaking of which,</i>

90
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:16,567
how are your two baby girls?

91
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:19,315
Wow, twins-
Congratulations.

92
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:21,058
Awkward!

93
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:23,437
He knocked up two different
women at the same time...

94
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,773
<i>At least he thinks he did.</i>

95
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:27,056
You have them DNA tested yet?
Why would I?

96
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:28,992
They look just like me.
But they will grow.

97
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:30,960
<i>Find out what else
he's lying about.</i>

98
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:32,328
Do an exercise test-

99
00:05:32,395 --> 00:05:33,930
See if you can get him
to go back into v-fib again.

100
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:35,832
But we could end up causing
another cardiac arrest.

101
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:37,834
Hopefully.
Then we'll know what set it off.

102
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,736
<i>He means it's better
to do it here</i>

103
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:41,170
where we can revive him

104
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:42,705
than have it happen
somewhere else.

105
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:45,708
The prodigal son has returned.

106
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:48,511
Now, if you'll excuse me,

107
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:51,447
I have to go slaughter
a fatted calf for lunch.

108
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,851
I told you,
I was sitting at my desk

109
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:57,253
when the attack happened.

110
00:05:59,623 --> 00:06:01,524
These rug burns
are from last night.

111
00:06:01,591 --> 00:06:02,925
We think you were having sex,

112
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:05,061
but memory loss
could also be a symptom.

113
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:07,130
Maybe we should ask your wife.

114
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:09,431
Don't.

115
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:13,136
I- I did something
stupid last night,

116
00:06:13,203 --> 00:06:16,105
but it was
a one-time thing.

117
00:06:16,173 --> 00:06:18,741
You have no idea
how bad I feel about it.

118
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:20,877
<i>Your guilt is between
you and your wife.</i>

119
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:22,912
We just need to know
what happened.

120
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:28,384
I was having sex at a motel

121
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:30,452
<i>when I started to feel
light-headed.</i>

122
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,221
<i>Next thing I knew,
I was laying on my back.</i>

123
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:34,957
I could barely breathe.

124
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,292
Is everything all right?

125
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:38,627
We'd like to perform
an exercise test,

126
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:41,998
re-create the stress that
may have caused his symptoms.

127
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:43,666
He was sitting at his desk.

128
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:45,234
<i>It's his heart
we're worried about.</i>

129
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:46,769
The test will monitor
its rhythm

130
00:06:46,837 --> 00:06:48,537
so we can check
for any abnormalities.

131
00:06:55,112 --> 00:06:56,746
I spent a month in solitary.

132
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:59,215
You don't think
I can keep this up all day?

133
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,226
I have a headache.
Could you just lower your voice?

134
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:14,430
Chase and Taub are back!

135
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:17,100
You want me to pick up
an ice-cream cake?

136
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,836
I also think that Taub
has brought

137
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:22,805
his little Taubettes
into work with him today.

138
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:24,273
Why would he do that?

139
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:26,242
Because I didn't give him time
to do anything else.

140
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:27,877
<i>Then I started wondering,</i>

141
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:30,412
who'd be sappy enough
to watch them for him?

142
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,281
They're not here.

143
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:34,050
What?

144
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:37,720
I just came for a chat
with a friend.

145
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:40,322
What's that I smell, friend?

146
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,792
I understand your confusion.

147
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,293
I was eating a baby for lunch,

148
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:46,829
<i>and...</i>

149
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:48,664
<i>I have a massive migraine.</i>

150
00:07:48,732 --> 00:07:51,267
Will you please just go away?

151
00:07:54,104 --> 00:07:56,839
You should probably
lie down and rest.

152
00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:59,341
Yeah.
I was trying to.

153
00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:03,179
Oh!
There is one more thing.

154
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:16,659
He's in too good of shape.

155
00:08:16,726 --> 00:08:19,495
We need to get him to the point
he was at last night.

156
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:21,297
Well, don't look at me.

157
00:08:21,364 --> 00:08:23,666
<i>But if you want to...</i>

158
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,168
Cute.

159
00:08:25,235 --> 00:08:27,203
But I didn't mean
physical stress.

160
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:30,639
<i>Don't you guys think
this is irresponsible?</i>

161
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:34,576
It's like you getting two women
pregnant at the same time.

162
00:08:34,644 --> 00:08:37,280
I just mean the part about
the odds of it happening.

163
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,182
They had to be incredibly high.

164
00:08:39,249 --> 00:08:41,517
<i>And if we induce v-fib,</i>

165
00:08:41,584 --> 00:08:43,119
odds say that we'll be able
to revive him.

166
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:45,054
But there's always
a chance we can't.

167
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:47,223
It's extreme and reckless.
That's House.

168
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,192
You get used to it.

169
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:51,794
Or I fire you.

170
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:54,330
Look what I found...

171
00:08:54,397 --> 00:08:55,764
Kiddie-winkies!

172
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:57,166
I wonder who they belong to.

173
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:58,701
Give me my kids.

174
00:08:58,768 --> 00:09:01,170
No. I genuinely wonder
who they belong to.

175
00:09:01,238 --> 00:09:02,571
I need a DNA sample.

176
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,739
I'm not letting you
DNA test my kids.

177
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:06,742
Already did.
This swab's for you.

178
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:12,681
Fine. If you don't mind paying
a fortune in child support

179
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:17,353
for some other guy's kids,
no skin cells off my cheek.

180
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,456
<i>His heart rate's
finally elevating.</i>

181
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:23,659
Dr. Chase said you had
something to tell me.

182
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:26,162
We were talking about
how you got the abrasions

183
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,696
<i>on your knees-
The flag football game.</i>

184
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:29,098
Oh, um...

185
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,400
Yeah, honey, I'm gonna need you
to let the guys know

186
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:33,602
I'm not gonna be able
to play on Saturday.

187
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,804
The whole town knows
that you're in the hospital.

188
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:36,939
I wouldn't worry about it.

189
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:38,374
That's not what
you wanted to tell her.

190
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:41,510
You said the game
wasn't typical.

191
00:09:41,578 --> 00:09:43,812
<i>Something happened
that you were upset about?</i>

192
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:46,282
I don't understand.
What are you-

193
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,353
I don't f-
I don't feel very w-

194
00:09:52,897 --> 00:09:54,223
<i>What's happening?</i>

195
00:09:57,027 --> 00:09:58,327
It's not his heart.

196
00:09:58,395 --> 00:10:00,162
I know.

197
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,131
He's having a seizure.

198
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:21,439
There wasn't any abnormal
electrical activity

199
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,700
in his E.K.G.
when his seizure occurred.

200
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:25,268
It wasn't caused
by a v-fib.

201
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:27,337
We still can't rule it out.

202
00:10:27,404 --> 00:10:28,805
His E.K.G. from the E.R.
documented-

203
00:10:28,873 --> 00:10:30,206
<i>Myocarditis-</i>

204
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:32,308
viral infection
weakening the wall muscles.

205
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:33,844
<i>We need to biopsy
his heart to confirm.</i>

206
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:36,446
Myocarditis wouldn't cause a seizure.

207
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:37,748
Could be genetic-Brugada syndrome.

208
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:42,318
Oh, my God.

209
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:44,287
Two prodigal sons.

210
00:10:44,355 --> 00:10:45,488
Come on.
Let's hug it out.

211
00:10:45,556 --> 00:10:47,658
You really like the idea,

212
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:50,527
<i>or you just want to grab some hair
for a DNA test? It's a stupid idea.</i>

213
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:52,929
We would have seen evidence
of Brugada in the E.K.G.

214
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:54,464
You know, this is...

215
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:56,299
This is just messing
with my Feng Shui here.

216
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:57,634
What about over there?

217
00:10:57,702 --> 00:11:00,103
A Pheochromocytoma.

218
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:03,140
Excess adrenaline
can cause heart problems

219
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:06,043
and... seizures.

220
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,678
Boring!
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:09,713
I thought I was here
to treat the patients,

222
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:11,181
not entertain you.

223
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:12,916
Would it hurt to do both?

224
00:11:15,086 --> 00:11:16,953
Oh, this is much better!

225
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:18,989
I said it was boring.

226
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:21,424
I didn't say it was wrong.
So I'm right.

227
00:11:21,492 --> 00:11:23,760
<i>Nope. You're wrong.
Photic epilepsy-</i>

228
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:25,162
It's equally boring,

229
00:11:25,229 --> 00:11:26,462
but it has the advantage
of possibly being right.

230
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,865
<i>Give him an E.E.G.
to confirm.</i>

231
00:11:41,512 --> 00:11:43,013
<i>If you ever hear me mention</i>

232
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:44,480
anything about wanting kids,

233
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,717
please feel free to punch me
in the liver.

234
00:11:46,784 --> 00:11:48,218
<i>Why?</i>

235
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:56,026
It's like Satan's alarm clock.

236
00:11:56,094 --> 00:11:58,361
What's House up to?
He hasn't asked me for anything.

237
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:00,130
He's been incredibly
well-behaved.

238
00:12:00,198 --> 00:12:01,631
He's doing his clinic hours.

239
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:02,999
That is a sign of concern.

240
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,835
And you know him
as well as I do.

241
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:06,937
He needs to constantly
establish he's the Alpha dog.

242
00:12:07,004 --> 00:12:08,839
He's got his team back.
He's got his office back.

243
00:12:08,906 --> 00:12:10,607
He's got everything he needs.

244
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:13,777
You really believe that-
He's content?

245
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:17,580
I don't want to let
House sabotage himself

246
00:12:17,648 --> 00:12:18,882
by sabotaging me,

247
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,851
and I need your guidance
and your trust to do that.

248
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:22,485
No, no, no.

249
00:12:22,553 --> 00:12:24,888
Cuddy had a problem with House,
she came to me.

250
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:26,923
Wanted to vent-me.

251
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:28,524
How did that turn out?

252
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:30,560
You have a problem with House,
deal with it,

253
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:33,029
or find someone else who can.

254
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,902
<i>I'm sorry about earlier,</i>

255
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,403
but we needed
to provoke a reaction.

256
00:12:40,471 --> 00:12:42,172
It worked.

257
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,674
I can barely look her
in the eyes anymore.

258
00:12:44,742 --> 00:12:47,310
I'd want my husband
to tell me the truth.

259
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:48,678
Sure.

260
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:50,847
<i>You'll feel better,
and she'll feel what-</i>

261
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:51,782
<i>devastated, betrayed?</i>

262
00:12:51,849 --> 00:12:53,283
Heartbroken.

263
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,318
Do you really
want to do that to her?

264
00:12:55,386 --> 00:12:57,520
No.

265
00:12:57,588 --> 00:13:00,456
But I can't live like this.

266
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:02,793
But she can.

267
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,261
<i>All set.</i>

268
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:06,930
All right, we need you
to sit back and try to relax.

269
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:09,199
Just look at the light.

270
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:23,479
What exactly are they
building back there?

271
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:25,048
A dream.

272
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:27,217
The E.E.G. didn't show
any abnormal brain activity.

273
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:29,385
He doesn't have Photic epilepsy.

274
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:30,921
I know, because he has
a Pheochromocytoma.

275
00:13:30,988 --> 00:13:32,956
You said I was wrong.

276
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:34,791
You were wrong not to
rule out epilepsy first.

277
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:36,860
<i>That only takes
a couple of hours.</i>

278
00:13:36,928 --> 00:13:38,929
<i>Finding a tumor that's flushing
adrenaline through his system</i>

279
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:40,430
<i>is gonna take all night.</i>

280
00:13:40,497 --> 00:13:42,299
Monitor his brain activity,
start a continuous urine test

281
00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:43,466
<i>and blood draws
every two hours.</i>

282
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:44,835
I can't!
I have my kids!

283
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:46,803
Wilson's leaving
in, like, 15 minutes!

284
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:48,805
Chase and Adams can
do the test. Thank you.

285
00:13:54,979 --> 00:13:57,680
For the massage bed.

286
00:13:57,748 --> 00:13:59,115
You and Park
are checking the motel

287
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:02,785
he was bumping uglies at
for environmental factors.

288
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:14,998
He couldn't find a babysitter.

289
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,432
Get over it.

290
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,101
You're gonna get us killed.

291
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:19,836
She thinks I'm a prostitute
on her turf.

292
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:21,972
Showing weakness
is what gets you killed.

293
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,539
Why would she think
you're a prostitute?

294
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,608
I'm in a dump with a guy
almost twice my age.

295
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:28,111
What else is she gonna think?

296
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:29,612
How old do you think I am?

297
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:46,596
So who cheated on you?

298
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:49,933
We just met.

299
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,601
Don't you think
it's a little early

300
00:14:51,668 --> 00:14:54,537
to be dragging up our baggage
in front of each other?

301
00:14:54,605 --> 00:14:57,207
Who says I have baggage?

302
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,209
I know when House
went to prison,

303
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:01,511
you quit medicine.

304
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:03,113
- You don't do that unless...
- I didn't quit.

305
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,847
I took a vacation.

306
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:06,749
I knew when he got out,
I'd get my job back.

307
00:15:06,817 --> 00:15:09,386
House didn't even know
he was coming back.

308
00:15:09,453 --> 00:15:11,021
I had faith.

309
00:15:12,723 --> 00:15:15,058
Now, that has baggage
stamped all over it.

310
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,230
<i>Seizure activity?</i>

311
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:22,632
No. One of the sensors
came loose.

312
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:24,334
I'll fix it.

313
00:15:35,313 --> 00:15:36,879
What is it?

314
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:40,350
Not a Pheochromocytoma.

315
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:46,148
Our patient now has
a mass in his neck,

316
00:15:46,216 --> 00:15:48,517
and his body temp's been rising
over the last three hours.

317
00:15:48,584 --> 00:15:50,085
Where is the construction crew?

318
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:52,187
<i>Well, I'm not gonna make
them work day and night.</i>

319
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:53,722
So I chose night.

320
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:56,025
And his urine and blood tests

321
00:15:56,092 --> 00:15:59,228
didn't show any evidence of
an adrenaline-secreting tumor.

322
00:15:59,295 --> 00:16:02,331
Meningitis. We can do
a lumbar puncture to confirm.

323
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,632
Sorry. I had to drop
my kids off

324
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:05,300
<i>at day care across town.</i>

325
00:16:05,368 --> 00:16:06,801
What'd I miss?
It's not meningitis.

326
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:09,704
His neck isn't stiff,
and his mental status is normal.

327
00:16:09,772 --> 00:16:11,273
<i>He's only guessing.</i>

328
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:13,375
I'm talking to Taub.

329
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:15,777
He can't say "my kids"
until he lets me test them.

330
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:17,879
<i>Tell me about the love shack</i>

331
00:16:17,947 --> 00:16:19,781
<i>where he cheated on his bride.</i>

332
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:21,216
Quarters came in handy.

333
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:23,852
<i>My kids loved the massage bed.</i>

334
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,989
Lab tests show the bed
tested positive for, uh,

335
00:16:28,058 --> 00:16:30,892
semen, vaginal secretions,

336
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,128
<i>saliva, and fecal matter,</i>

337
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:35,397
both human and animal.

338
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:37,666
<i>Probably want to boil the kids</i>

339
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,334
for a couple hours
when you get home.

340
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:40,635
<i>The bathroom
also tested positive</i>

341
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,405
for five different types
of pathogenic bacteria.

342
00:16:43,473 --> 00:16:45,274
Fusobacterium necrophorum was one of them.

343
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:47,876
Yeah. How'd you know?
The bulge in his neck.

344
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:52,914
Bacteria colonized
his parapharyngeal space,

345
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:55,317
moved into his jugular vein,
causing a thrombus-

346
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:56,751
<i>Lemierre's syndrome.</i>

347
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:59,388
<i>Treat with amoxicillin
and clavulanic acid.</i>

348
00:16:59,456 --> 00:17:01,323
Take out the clot
before it moves to his lungs

349
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:02,891
and kills him.

350
00:17:26,483 --> 00:17:29,084
You got at least
a trillion cells.

351
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:30,919
You're gonna misplace
one of them eventually.

352
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:35,924
I have to tell
my wife the truth.

353
00:17:37,927 --> 00:17:40,095
There's plenty of time
for that after the operation.

354
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:41,330
What if I die,

355
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:42,998
and one day she finds out
I cheated on her?

356
00:17:43,065 --> 00:17:44,366
I'll never be able to explain,

357
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:46,034
never tell her how sorry I am.

358
00:17:46,102 --> 00:17:47,536
<i>You're increasing
the odds of that</i>

359
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:49,338
every second we waste here.

360
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:52,874
No, I'm not agreeing
to anything until I talk to her.

361
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:55,043
<i>Daddy!</i>

362
00:17:55,111 --> 00:17:56,077
Hey.

363
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,581
Hey, guys.

364
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:00,782
Ew!

365
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,252
Your neck looks really gross.

366
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:05,120
I missed you both so much.

367
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:06,955
But I need to ask you favor.

368
00:18:07,023 --> 00:18:10,125
I need to talk to mommy
alone for a second.

369
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:13,428
Would you mind
watching them for us?

370
00:18:24,106 --> 00:18:25,907
This guy's an idiot.

371
00:18:25,975 --> 00:18:27,809
I think he actually
has a good point.

372
00:18:27,877 --> 00:18:29,811
What would you think
if you found out years later

373
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:32,481
your beloved dead wife
cheated on you?

374
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:36,785
I wouldn't believe it.

375
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:38,787
As long as I don't
hear it directly from her,

376
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:42,291
then I can hang on to hope
that it's not true.

377
00:18:42,358 --> 00:18:46,528
But this way...

378
00:18:46,596 --> 00:18:49,097
She has to either dump him
or forgive him.

379
00:18:52,468 --> 00:18:55,337
Guys, get your stuff.
We're leaving.

380
00:18:57,006 --> 00:18:59,575
I'm so sorry.

381
00:18:59,642 --> 00:19:01,343
I'll be back.

382
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:04,779
I'm gonna drop our kids off
at my mother's.

383
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:06,915
Look, he made a mistake...

384
00:19:06,982 --> 00:19:10,552
A stupid, horrible mistake.

385
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,588
But we'll get through this.

386
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:16,325
All I care about right now
is that my husband gets better.

387
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,934
Sorry about yesterday.

388
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:29,871
<i>House was like the child catcher
from chitty chitty bang bang.</i>

389
00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:32,207
Why is he so obsessed
with my kids being my kids?

390
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,844
Because he sees insecurity,

391
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:38,046
and when House senses weakness,
he pounces,

392
00:19:38,114 --> 00:19:39,481
and because his insecurity

393
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,916
is the fact that other people
can have faith

394
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:45,554
and don't have the obsessive
need for physical proof.

395
00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:48,022
Also, he started a betting pool

396
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:51,826
on which kid is yours
and which isn't.

397
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:04,339
An entire hospital betting
on the legitimacy of my kids?

398
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:08,710
It's great to be back
among friends.

399
00:20:27,863 --> 00:20:31,099
I'm not the bad guy here.

400
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:33,402
I'm betting on them both
being yours.

401
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:42,043
I would have donated
the money to charity.

402
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,380
Approaching the clot.

403
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:48,450
Stand by for...

404
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:51,219
It's not a clot.

405
00:20:51,287 --> 00:20:53,622
It's his lymph nodes.

406
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,490
The bulge wasn't caused
by pus or blood.

407
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:56,958
It's tissue inflammation.

408
00:20:57,026 --> 00:20:59,160
- How can there be that much tissue?
- Lymphoma.

409
00:20:59,228 --> 00:21:01,712
We need to take a biopsy.

410
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:14,205
Did I Nick something?

411
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:15,889
I don't know.
I don't see any bleeding in here.

412
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:21,950
His sclera's jaundiced.

413
00:21:22,017 --> 00:21:24,386
I think it's his liver.
It's failing.

414
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,330
We did a major operation
for no reason.

415
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,019
It's not Lemierre's syndrome.

416
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:31,921
We would have had to biopsy
his lymph nodes anyway

417
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:33,523
to check for cancer.

418
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:35,563
Which it's not.
Biopsy was clean.

419
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:37,111
We could be dealing with

420
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:38,766
an alcoholic
going through withdrawal.

421
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:40,134
<i>It explains his heart,
seizures,</i>

422
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:41,508
and liver failing.

423
00:21:41,628 --> 00:21:44,271
<i>But not his swollen
lymph nodes.</i>

424
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:46,273
Why are we stealing
cable from here?

425
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,042
We don't even have a TV
in our office.

426
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:49,476
I'm an ex-con

427
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,945
trying to adjust to a world
that's passed me by.

428
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:53,914
Stealing's all I know-

429
00:21:53,982 --> 00:21:55,348
That and the fact
that I was right

430
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,184
about what's wrong
with our patient.

431
00:21:57,251 --> 00:21:59,787
Just wrong about what?

432
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:02,856
He means it's not Lemierre's,
but it's still an infection,

433
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:04,491
which is why
it's spreading so rapidly.

434
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,695
Cultures take time, and his
liver doesn't have much left.

435
00:22:07,762 --> 00:22:09,429
That's why
we're gonna blast him

436
00:22:09,497 --> 00:22:11,765
with broad-spectrum
antibiotics.

437
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:13,466
The blast will fry
what's left of his liver.

438
00:22:13,534 --> 00:22:14,968
The cure will kill him.

439
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:16,436
Not if we get him
a liver transplant first

440
00:22:16,504 --> 00:22:17,604
and then treat him
with a broad spectrum.

441
00:22:17,672 --> 00:22:20,874
And old team for the win!

442
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:22,375
Not that I'm keeping score.

443
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:23,610
<i>It's more of a grid</i>

444
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:25,913
where I assign numerical values

445
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,381
to determine who gets raises,
vacation time,

446
00:22:28,449 --> 00:22:30,317
and my respect.

447
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:36,757
We have him on the donor list
for a liver.

448
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:38,592
But these things take time.

449
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,761
So he could die
before he gets one.

450
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:43,563
<i>It's a possibility.
But we have another option.</i>

451
00:22:43,631 --> 00:22:44,898
We can do
a partial liver transplant

452
00:22:44,966 --> 00:22:45,999
from a living donor.

453
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:47,500
I'll do it.

454
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:49,803
If you're a match,
but to increase our odds,

455
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:52,272
we'd like to get your friends
and family tested as well.

456
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,507
Is it safe?

457
00:22:54,575 --> 00:22:56,844
It's a major surgery.

458
00:22:56,911 --> 00:22:58,879
The donor spends a week
in the hospital

459
00:22:58,947 --> 00:23:01,314
<i>and up to three months
convalescing at home.</i>

460
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:03,083
I can't ask someone
to do that for me.

461
00:23:03,151 --> 00:23:05,352
There are hundreds of people
who would do that for you.

462
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:07,387
Because they don't know
the real me.

463
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:09,422
You are a good man

464
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,692
who made a mistake.

465
00:23:12,761 --> 00:23:16,463
Then I have to tell them first.

466
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:20,433
I have to live with this too.

467
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:23,370
I know.

468
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:25,672
And I'm sorry, but...

469
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,243
This is the only way
that I can do this.

470
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,118
Before I ask any of you

471
00:24:11,186 --> 00:24:13,353
to sacrifice three months
of your life for me,

472
00:24:13,421 --> 00:24:16,056
I have a confession.

473
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:18,558
I had an affair.

474
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:24,397
I cheated on Denise.

475
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:26,399
I wouldn't blame anyone
if you decide-

476
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:27,901
I forgive him.

477
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:30,403
That should be enough
for all of us.

478
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:32,339
Thank you so much
for coming here-

479
00:24:32,406 --> 00:24:34,708
There's more.

480
00:24:39,513 --> 00:24:41,715
Larry...

481
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:44,451
That new transmission
I put in your truck-

482
00:24:44,518 --> 00:24:45,853
You didn't need it.

483
00:24:49,824 --> 00:24:52,559
Joe, same thing
with the engine rebuild.

484
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:56,964
In fact, I cheated
most of you here tonight.

485
00:24:57,031 --> 00:24:58,899
<i>Half the time
you bring your cars</i>

486
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:02,970
into my garage,
there's nothing wrong with them.

487
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:05,605
<i>I've been ripping you all off
for years.</i>

488
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:13,347
I also took $10,000 from
the harvest scholarship fund,

489
00:25:13,414 --> 00:25:15,883
<i>and I lost it gambling.</i>

490
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,487
I'm sorry.

491
00:25:20,554 --> 00:25:22,890
I'm not the man
you thought I was.

492
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,303
That went over well.

493
00:25:38,572 --> 00:25:40,707
Out of the two donors
who didn't walk out,

494
00:25:40,775 --> 00:25:42,842
both were negative
for a potential match.

495
00:25:42,911 --> 00:25:45,012
Telling the truth may have
just killed this guy.

496
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,914
I told him to tell
his wife he cheated,

497
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:49,149
not confess every sin
he's ever committed.

498
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:51,618
If everyone did that, we'd never
find a donor for anyone again.

499
00:25:51,685 --> 00:25:53,120
Everybody doesn't lie,
cheat, or steal

500
00:25:53,187 --> 00:25:55,289
from their friends.
Yeah, they do.

501
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:57,391
Maybe not as much as this guy,

502
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,592
<i>but if people told
nothing but the truth,</i>

503
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,396
the world would probably
burn down overnight.

504
00:26:02,463 --> 00:26:04,664
Some people think
it's burning now.

505
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:06,833
Maybe if everybody
didn't lie...

506
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:09,602
<i>Aw, that is cute.</i>

507
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,305
I'm talking about your breasts.

508
00:26:11,372 --> 00:26:15,442
<i>They always get perky when
you're being painfully earnest.</i>

509
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,444
Truth.

510
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:18,912
<i>It's uncomfortable, isn't it?</i>

511
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,480
More truth-I only noticed

512
00:26:20,548 --> 00:26:23,050
because Chase
was staring at them.

513
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:25,752
He'd never admit it, because
he doesn't want to offend you.

514
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,954
Same reason he'd never tell you

515
00:26:27,021 --> 00:26:28,721
that he's thought
about having sex with you.

516
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,457
<i>Although, to be fair,
every man you've ever met</i>

517
00:26:30,524 --> 00:26:32,625
has thought
about having sex with you.

518
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:34,494
They'll lie,
because if you knew...

519
00:26:34,562 --> 00:26:36,830
You probably wouldn't want
to have sex with them.

520
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:39,967
And that's just some of the lies
from the last minute.

521
00:26:40,034 --> 00:26:42,436
And here's a bigger one-

522
00:26:42,503 --> 00:26:44,771
You already know this,
but you pretend you don't

523
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,840
because it makes you
feel civilized.

524
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:50,210
Most people find it easier
to ignore the truth.

525
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:51,811
Ask Taub.

526
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:54,381
Our patient can't wait
for a transplant

527
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:56,483
that's never gonna come.

528
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,318
We need to get reckless
and extreme.

529
00:26:58,386 --> 00:27:00,087
<i>C.T. his liver,
find the damaged area,</i>

530
00:27:00,154 --> 00:27:01,221
<i>and cut it out.</i>

531
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:03,623
Hopefully, what's left
will be enough

532
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:06,360
so we can start treatment
with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

533
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:14,134
I'm sorry the first time
I had both of you together

534
00:27:14,202 --> 00:27:16,436
I had to work.

535
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:20,273
But daddy's boss is what
we call a jackass.

536
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:28,815
Good. Stay right there.

537
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:32,352
I'm also sorry...

538
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,788
For what I'm about to do...

539
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,592
Because...

540
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:45,098
Because nothing will ever change
how I feel about you guys.

541
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,912
But...

542
00:27:58,979 --> 00:28:02,949
But daddy is weak
and needs to know.

543
00:28:03,017 --> 00:28:04,817
Okay.

544
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:07,187
Just gonna put this
right here... Okay?

545
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:22,369
It's 3:30 in the morning.
Why are you still here?

546
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:23,570
House is here

547
00:28:23,637 --> 00:28:25,138
and apparently prepping
for an operation

548
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:26,606
that will probably
kill a patient.

549
00:28:26,674 --> 00:28:28,641
I wouldn't be doing this if
I thought there was another way.

550
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:30,343
There is.
He needs a transplant.

551
00:28:30,411 --> 00:28:32,412
You have one lying around?

552
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,114
'Cause he'll be dead
if he doesn't get one

553
00:28:34,182 --> 00:28:35,482
in the next few hours.

554
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,684
That falls
under natural causes.

555
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:39,186
- If you kill him, we're looking at...
- Dead is dead.

556
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:42,822
Not as far as our lawyers
are concerned.

557
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,458
I'm not being a dick.

558
00:28:44,525 --> 00:28:45,992
This is a real issue,

559
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,161
and I have to worry
about the big picture now.

560
00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:49,629
I don't.

561
00:28:49,697 --> 00:28:52,099
I'll be doing what you
would have done a year ago.

562
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,833
I'll be in surgery.

563
00:28:55,303 --> 00:28:56,603
<i>Chase...</i>

564
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,106
You need to check this out.

565
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:02,175
This is a C.T. scan
of his liver

566
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:05,112
<i>from ten hours ago...</i>

567
00:29:05,179 --> 00:29:06,446
This is from now.

568
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:08,681
It's healing itself.

569
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,062
<i>When I left the room,</i>

570
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,698
he was telling her
about the strippers

571
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:20,299
from his bachelor party.

572
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,635
Liver function
has improved 30%-

573
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:26,205
<i>Buys us a few extra days
before he'll need a transplant.</i>

574
00:29:26,272 --> 00:29:28,006
Interesting question is,
why is it regenerating?

575
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,150
And scene.

576
00:29:38,218 --> 00:29:42,488
Now we're back
to boring reality reality.

577
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:44,390
His liver was in shock before.

578
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:46,726
He's been having an allergic
reaction since he got here.

579
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:48,994
Could explain why his symptoms
appeared so rapidly.

580
00:29:49,062 --> 00:29:50,429
And maybe starting to go away.

581
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,531
We need to run a scratch test
to find out what set it off.

582
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:55,334
Or who. This all started
when he cheated on his wife.

583
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,636
He's allergic to a person?

584
00:29:57,704 --> 00:30:00,506
Or something
she's wearing-

585
00:30:00,574 --> 00:30:02,140
Makeup, perfume,

586
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:05,344
birth control method,
her "Hello Kitty" doll.

587
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:07,413
Two of you go find her
and find out what.

588
00:30:07,481 --> 00:30:09,749
Two of you start treatment
with corticosteroids

589
00:30:09,816 --> 00:30:12,084
and epinephrine
while you run the scratch test.

590
00:30:16,155 --> 00:30:18,323
You think I did this to him?

591
00:30:18,392 --> 00:30:21,059
Or something you wear,
own, use, or gave him.

592
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:23,195
I gave him a condom.
He didn't have one.

593
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:24,764
What kind?
I don't know what kind.

594
00:30:24,831 --> 00:30:27,332
I got it from the health fair
I was working at.

595
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:29,535
You're in the medical
profession? I'm miss Cedarville.

596
00:30:29,603 --> 00:30:31,370
The health fair
is one of my responsibilities.

597
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:34,440
Is another one hooking up
with 38-year-old married men?

598
00:30:36,142 --> 00:30:38,811
I guess I'm supposed
to be the good cop.

599
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:43,148
I know this is tough.

600
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:46,752
But anything you can remember
might help save his life.

601
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,588
He was giving me
a ride home, and...

602
00:30:49,656 --> 00:30:52,090
He always seemed so nice.

603
00:30:52,158 --> 00:30:54,192
And then we ended up
at the motel.

604
00:30:56,963 --> 00:30:58,464
And now everybody's talking
about it.

605
00:30:58,532 --> 00:30:59,732
And if they find out it was me,

606
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,468
I'm gonna lose my title
and probably my job.

607
00:31:02,536 --> 00:31:06,705
And no one in town is ever
gonna speak to me again.

608
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:08,173
<i>I made a mistake,</i>

609
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,009
<i>and now it's gonna end up
ruining my life.</i>

610
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,879
Denise never wants
to see me again.

611
00:31:13,947 --> 00:31:16,148
What did you think
was gonna happen?

612
00:31:17,717 --> 00:31:19,418
I was sick of living a lie.

613
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:22,187
Everybody loved me.
Everybody looked up to me.

614
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,489
But...

615
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:25,123
I didn't deserve it.

616
00:31:25,191 --> 00:31:27,292
Everybody makes mistakes.

617
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,161
They just don't usually
broadcast all of them

618
00:31:29,228 --> 00:31:30,596
at the same time.

619
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:32,297
Well, if I'm gonna die,

620
00:31:32,365 --> 00:31:34,567
I might as well do it
with a clean soul.

621
00:31:34,634 --> 00:31:36,001
And if you live?

622
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:38,303
You didn't just burn bridges.

623
00:31:38,371 --> 00:31:40,973
You torched, nuked,
and salted the earth with them.

624
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,543
Everybody has to pay
for their sins.

625
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,345
Oh, it feels like

626
00:31:46,412 --> 00:31:48,280
you stuck me with a hot poker.

627
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:49,648
An allergic reaction.

628
00:31:49,716 --> 00:31:51,149
It's the swab for
wheat-based allergies.

629
00:31:51,217 --> 00:31:52,852
I've been eating wheat
my entire life.

630
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,353
I'm not allergic to wheat.

631
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,189
Now it feels like
my whole body's on fire.

632
00:31:59,493 --> 00:32:01,494
This doesn't make any sense.

633
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:02,962
He broke out with a rash

634
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:04,797
right after I tested
with the wheat-allergy swab,

635
00:32:04,865 --> 00:32:07,633
but none of his blood samples
show he's allergic to it.

636
00:32:07,701 --> 00:32:09,067
Then he's not allergic to it.

637
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,436
Could the corticosteroids
have somehow caused it?

638
00:32:11,505 --> 00:32:13,506
I didn't hook them up yet.
After he broke out,

639
00:32:13,573 --> 00:32:16,074
I wanted to confirm it was
gluten before we dosed him.

640
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,442
Could be a latex allergy.

641
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:19,144
Started with a condom,

642
00:32:19,212 --> 00:32:21,146
and we kept it going
with our gloves and equipment.

643
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:23,081
He doesn't test positive
for that either.

644
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,416
None of his samples
test positive for anything.

645
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,652
Then he's allergic
to something not on the tests.

646
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,053
<i>I'll keep looking here.</i>

647
00:32:28,121 --> 00:32:29,788
We'll start the steroids
and see if it clears up.

648
00:32:44,303 --> 00:32:47,406
You have one patient
and three DNA results?

649
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:50,543
How else do I compare them
to other genetic disorders?

650
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,944
What's up?

651
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,846
Chase basically called me
a sellout.

652
00:32:53,914 --> 00:32:56,015
Just because you hung up
your lab coat for more money

653
00:32:56,082 --> 00:32:58,150
and a bigger office?

654
00:32:58,217 --> 00:33:00,085
I hung it up because
someone had to run this place

655
00:33:00,153 --> 00:33:01,386
after Cuddy left.

656
00:33:01,454 --> 00:33:03,355
There are a lot of good
administrators out there,

657
00:33:03,423 --> 00:33:04,723
not many good doctors.

658
00:33:04,791 --> 00:33:06,058
More to it than you think.

659
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:07,626
For example,

660
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,994
you're looking at monkey DNA.

661
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,049
My analysis-

662
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:17,169
House took your results
after he manipulated you

663
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:19,124
into providing them.

664
00:33:41,014 --> 00:33:42,714
He's shedding his skin
like a snake.

665
00:33:42,782 --> 00:33:43,915
If it was an allergic reaction,

666
00:33:43,984 --> 00:33:45,851
the corticosteroids
and epinephrine

667
00:33:45,918 --> 00:33:48,020
<i>would have made him better,
not worse.</i>

668
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,564
Is everyone trying
to think of an answer?

669
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:57,701
Or is everyone afraid to say
what they think the answer is?

670
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,738
I take it you're in
the latter category.

671
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,274
Stevens-Johnson syndrome-

672
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,544
<i>It fits all of his symptoms
and explains</i>

673
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:08,579
<i>why he got worse
after the steroids.</i>

674
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,348
Most medication
exacerbates the condition.

675
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:12,750
There's no treatment for it.

676
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:18,756
It fits.

677
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,926
<i>Case closed.</i>

678
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,261
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

679
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:14,578
I feel like I'm in hell.

680
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:17,081
We can't give you
too much pain medication,

681
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,381
or we'll make
your condition worse.

682
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:28,158
I got one final
confession to make.

683
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:29,593
What's left-

684
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,929
You cheated on your taxes?

685
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:35,899
I'm a murderer.

686
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,768
<i>I killed my business partner.</i>

687
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:43,373
I shot him in the head.

688
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:46,476
I made it look like suicide.

689
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,780
<i>And he was just the first.</i>

690
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,016
You killed more?

691
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:52,783
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

692
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:56,486
Three...

693
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,158
Or four.

694
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,500
Try not to kill anyone else
until I get back.

695
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,640
It's neurological.

696
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:18,108
There's an aneurysm

697
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,243
in the anterior communicating
artery of his brain-

698
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,246
The area moderating
impulse control and compulsion.

699
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:24,281
<i>As it grew larger,</i>

700
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,717
so did the confessions.

701
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,852
Watch.

702
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:33,190
Bob, one of my shoes
is missing from my locker.

703
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,825
I'm so sorry.

704
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:38,028
<i>I- I needed the cash,
and, um,</i>

705
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,362
<i>the locker was open.</i>

706
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,065
I never heard
of a neurological problem

707
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,833
that causes someone's skin
to fall off.

708
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:46,103
Because there isn't one.

709
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,111
The aneurysm
is just another symptom.

710
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:55,512
<i>It's not the cause.</i>

711
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,315
You add them all together,
we get...

712
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,255
We get Kaw...Kawas...

713
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,456
<i>Kawas...</i>

714
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:08,225
It's Kawasaki's disease.

715
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:10,327
It's autoimmune.

716
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,962
Yes, we knew what "Kawah" meant.

717
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,797
We just figured since it
basically presents

718
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:14,898
only in Asian children-

719
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,867
Which you might have,
by the way.

720
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:19,569
Which is basically
why we missed it.

721
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:21,071
Rug burns-

722
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:22,405
<i>Certain carpet-cleaning
chemicals</i>

723
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:23,741
<i>have been linked to it.</i>

724
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,375
Start treatment with
intravenous immunoglobulin.

725
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,010
Monitor the aneurysm.

726
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,812
If it doesn't resolve itself,
we'll have to repair it.

727
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,313
The rest of you...

728
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,617
Aren't surfing enough.

729
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:42,826
Monkey DNA-
Nice touch.

730
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,394
Really?

731
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,696
You don't think
I should have gone with rat?

732
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,531
I've been second-guessing
myself all day.

733
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,600
Where are the DNA results?

734
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,203
First admit that I was right.

735
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,905
You manipulated me
into doing it.

736
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:56,339
Yeah, I'll admit to that.

737
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,008
Now you admit
that it was incredibly easy,

738
00:37:58,076 --> 00:37:59,176
because you can't cheat
an honest man.

739
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:00,644
I love them.

740
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:02,880
I don't care if one of them
isn't biologically mine.

741
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,547
What about both?

742
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,817
Could be.
Haven't read these.

743
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,319
Now say I was right.

744
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:13,390
No. I'll admit
I was weak for a moment,

745
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,858
but I'm not doing this.

746
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:16,193
I don't care.

747
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:20,264
You do, and I'll prove it.

748
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,899
I will shred this.

749
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,034
I will call off my pool,
return the money,

750
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:25,435
and we'll forget all about it.

751
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,537
Or we'll go to the light box
in the lab

752
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,739
and know the truth
once and for all.

753
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:35,745
Stop.

754
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:40,951
Let me see them.

755
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,133
Just wanted to make sure
all three were inside.

756
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:26,496
<i>The mayor checked.</i>

757
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:28,999
There wasn't any money missing
from the scholarship fund.

758
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:31,534
Dr. Chase told me...

759
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,070
About your disease,

760
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,340
how it made you confess
to crimes you hadn't committed.

761
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,322
The affair with that girl...

762
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,425
Is that real?

763
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,829
Honey, I...

764
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,572
Would never...

765
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,775
Have never cheated on you.

766
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,683
I knew you could never
do that to me.

767
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,619
I don't know how...

768
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:23,987
But I knew.

769
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:43,073
Glad to see taking a year off
didn't dull your skill set.

770
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,808
I got lucky.

771
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,711
About the other night...

772
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,681
<i>I have enough problems
with this job.</i>

773
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,117
Second-guessing
my best doctors

774
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,586
shouldn't be one of them.

775
00:40:58,622 --> 00:40:59,856
Why are you up here?

776
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,724
You have your own bathroom
and office now.

777
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,995
Shower. I haven't left
the hospital in four days.

778
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:06,796
Why?

779
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,432
House won't go home.

780
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,434
And there's no way I'm leaving
him here unsupervised.

781
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:21,911
House is screwing with you...

782
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,647
By not screwing with you.

783
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,684
He's watching TV
and drinking Martinis all night.

784
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:30,387
Meanwhile, he's keeping you here
searching for a plan

785
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:33,223
that doesn't even exist.

786
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,525
How the hell
did I not see that?

787
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,603
I'm glad you're back.

788
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,140
Me too.

789
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,720
Either a hot tub or a sauna.

790
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:06,689
A hot tub would be cool.

791
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:09,643
New team, old team...

792
00:42:10,182 --> 00:42:11,694
I present...

793
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:16,840
Phase one
of operation outer office 2.0.

794
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,477
Nothing's changed.

795
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:31,781
Oh, everything has changed.

796
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,609
No.

797
00:43:02,367 --> 00:43:14,303
