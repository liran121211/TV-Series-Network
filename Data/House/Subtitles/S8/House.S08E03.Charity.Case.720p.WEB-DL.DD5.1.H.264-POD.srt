00:00:01,004 --> 00:00:02,248
<i>If you don't know how to use a computer,</i>

2
00:00:02,248 --> 00:00:03,790
<i>we will teach you here.</i>

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,862
Most jobs require at least
basic word processing skills.

4
00:00:06,862 --> 00:00:08,871
We try to get you up to 50 words per minute.

5
00:00:08,871 --> 00:00:12,386
We also have a course in
how to talk to someone

6
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:13,392
<i>in an interview.</i>

7
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:14,904
<i>Stuff like</i>

8
00:00:14,904 --> 00:00:16,074
what employers are looking for,

9
00:00:16,074 --> 00:00:17,813
how to turn negatives into positives.

10
00:00:17,813 --> 00:00:19,084
We can also provide
clothes for the interview

11
00:00:19,374 --> 00:00:20,200
if you need them.

12
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,960
People donate shoes and suits all the time.

13
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,666
Wh-what if I had a history with, uh...

14
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:27,088
With drugs?

15
00:00:27,088 --> 00:00:29,514
That is nothing to be ashamed of.

16
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:31,438
Many of our clients have
struggled with addiction,

17
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:34,415
and, if you want to get clean,
we'll help you do that.

18
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:36,289
And what if I have a kid?

19
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:38,430
No one to help you?

20
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,137
You know, if I need someone to watch her

21
00:00:40,137 --> 00:00:43,097
while I'm in class or, uh, on an interview.

22
00:00:43,097 --> 00:00:44,621
Could you help with that?

23
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:47,080
We do not provide child care.

24
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,305
Actually, it's something
that comes up often.

25
00:00:49,305 --> 00:00:51,397
I would love to be able to do it.

26
00:00:51,397 --> 00:00:53,487
I just don't have the resources.

27
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:56,114
But it's definitely on the wish list.

28
00:00:56,114 --> 00:00:58,322
Okay.

29
00:00:58,322 --> 00:01:00,330
Okay, uh, thank you.

30
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,836
I'll be back.

31
00:01:01,836 --> 00:01:03,341
Oh, I have to take this.

32
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:05,701
Yes, please come back,
and we'll get you started.

33
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:07,491
It was nice to meet you, Benjamin.

34
00:01:07,491 --> 00:01:08,829
Okay.

35
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:11,004
Hey, Oscar.

36
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,898
Agh! Oh, that is too bad.

37
00:01:13,898 --> 00:01:15,219
Did they tell you why?

38
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,170
Yeah.

39
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:27,115
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

40
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:28,487
Well, you know what?

41
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,210
Sometimes, you just don't
get the job, but...

42
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,883
Oscar, I gotta call you back.

43
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,680
<i>Uh...</i>

44
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:38,608
Uh, uh...

45
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:44,346
Benjamin!

46
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:45,467
Benjamin, wait!

47
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:52,662
Oh, my God. Uh...

48
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:05,175

Why am I watching you cut your hair?

59
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,761
If I do it at home,

60
00:03:11,761 --> 00:03:13,802
I'm the one who has to clean it up.

61
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:16,575
Does a friend watch you where
it's happening, and wonder why?

62
00:03:18,236 --> 00:03:21,883
New life, new look.

63
00:03:21,883 --> 00:03:24,643
Does that mean you like your new life?

64
00:03:24,643 --> 00:03:26,818
If you're asking if your job is safe,

65
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:28,273
that depends on what you have to say

66
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:29,896
about the file you're holding.

67
00:03:29,896 --> 00:03:32,590
It doesn't seem like much of a case.

68
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,413
Although, I'm sure I'm wrong.

69
00:03:34,413 --> 00:03:36,471
You are. Tell my why.

70
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:38,930
Guy collapsed after being
on his feet for hours

71
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,105
on a hot day without breakfast...

72
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:42,578
So that's really weird.

73
00:03:42,578 --> 00:03:44,418
E.R. found nothing wrong.

74
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:47,179
Then I decided I should test his wallet.

75
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:48,517
He's rich?

76
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:49,771
That's why we're taking the case?

77
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,160
No, we're taking the
case because no one knows

78
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,917
what's wrong with him.

79
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,172
<i>And he's rich.</i>

80
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:59,859
Dr. Adams.

81
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:01,516
Give her the file.

82
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:03,373
This is my only copy.

83
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:07,221
My M.O. depends upon the use of a team.

84
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:09,145
Definitionally, that involves...

85
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:10,600
more than one person.

86
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,892
So I really have no choice.
Give her the file.

87
00:04:12,892 --> 00:04:14,365
You can't afford a team.

88
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:15,837
Adams is free.

89
00:04:15,837 --> 00:04:17,928
And I'm referring both to her availability

90
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:19,016
and her price tag.

91
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:24,436
New girl, meet newer girl, and vice versa.

92
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:26,494
You said we were meeting for coffee.

93
00:04:26,494 --> 00:04:28,803
Well, when someone asks if you want coffee,

94
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:31,128
they obviously don't just mean coffee.

95
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:34,692
Wait...did you think I was referring to sex?

96
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,202
Would you shut the blinds on your way out?

97
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:39,092
I thought you were referring to talking.

98
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:40,547
Talking about medicine.

99
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,772
Specifically, as it refers to the guy

100
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:45,951
<i>whose name is on the file she
still hasn't handed you.</i>

101
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,373
I'm not working, House.

102
00:04:47,373 --> 00:04:49,966
I'm in the process of
looking for a paying job.

103
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:51,171
In the meantime, there's no way

104
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,313
a do-gooder like you has been volunteering

105
00:04:53,313 --> 00:04:54,434
all over town--

106
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:56,742
ladling kittens, spaying soup...

107
00:04:56,742 --> 00:04:59,034
There is a free clinic in Trenton.

108
00:04:59,034 --> 00:05:01,744
Well, think of this as today's free clinic.

109
00:05:01,744 --> 00:05:03,752
Only with fewer bums with herpes.

110
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:05,609
I don't think we actually
have much of a case.

111
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:06,948
<i>I think it's just</i>

112
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:08,771
dehydration.

113
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:11,447
What happened the last time

114
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:13,455
another doctor told you I
was wrong about a case?

115
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:14,994
I lost my job.

116
00:05:14,994 --> 00:05:16,986
You saved a life.

117
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:22,339
Is an ultrasound really necessary?

118
00:05:22,339 --> 00:05:24,096
I'm feeling much better now.

119
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:25,367
Oh, a sudden collapse at your age

120
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,843
can indicate a deterioration
of the heart muscle.

121
00:05:27,843 --> 00:05:29,617
Pretty serious condition.

122
00:05:29,617 --> 00:05:32,461
It can also just be dehydration.

123
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:35,087
Next time, you could probably
drop the undercover act.

124
00:05:36,175 --> 00:05:37,480
I walk in in a suit,

125
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,457
and they're gonna put
their best foot forward.

126
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,699
Also, I don't own a suit.

127
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:45,911
You give away millions
and you don't own a suit?

128
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:47,551
I gave those away too.

129
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:50,362
One day, I was writing a
check to my landscaper,

130
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:51,934
and it suddenly hit me--

131
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,782
$6,000 to take out plants
and put in different plants.

132
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,589
So I can look at them.

133
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:00,533
Shouldn't I use that money
to do something important?

134
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:01,704
<i>And by money,</i>

135
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:03,796
you mean all your money.

136
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,469
I started with 10 million,

137
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:08,496
and I couldn't think of
a reason not to give 20.

138
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:09,218
Or 40.

139
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:14,185
I figure I could live off $25,000 a year.

140
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:15,908
One-room apartment.

141
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,363
Bus pass, thrift stores.

142
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:19,538
Bare necessities.

143
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:22,015
I still have my software company.

144
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:25,127
And when I make more,
I'll give that way too.

145
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:27,000
- He's nuts.
- He's generous.

146
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,539
There's a neurological issue.

147
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:30,079
He's getting rid of everything.

148
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,635
His echocardiogram is negative

149
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:32,673
for cardiomyopathy.

150
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:34,329
Head CT showed no signs
of stroke or hemorrhage.

151
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:36,821
He has one pair of pants.

152
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:38,410
Most people with his kind of money

153
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,849
are commissioning oil paintings

154
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,087
of their Yorkshire terrier.

155
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:43,296
<i>Benjamin is sacrificing</i>

156
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:44,818
his own comfort to help others.

157
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:48,114
<i>That's because helping others is
his Yorkie oil painting.</i>

158
00:06:48,114 --> 00:06:49,335
That's good.

159
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:50,623
Not sick.

160
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,162
<i>That's naive and sick.</i>

161
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,300
You really want to improve things?

162
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,722
You do it through policy.

163
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:57,482
This guy empties his pockets,
what really changes?

164
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,038
That's right, all those babies with aids,

165
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:00,493
they're just using us.

166
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:02,468
My parents had $800 between them

167
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:03,538
when they got here.

168
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:05,094
<i>They scraped and borrowed</i>

169
00:07:05,094 --> 00:07:06,098
<i>so we could go to good schools,</i>

170
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:07,654
and I worked my ass off.

171
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,578
No one gave me a handout.

172
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:10,866
It makes me work harder.

173
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:12,673
Rebuttal.

174
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:15,936
What's your evil plan?

175
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,642
I object to your cynicism.

176
00:07:17,642 --> 00:07:19,650
<i>- It's been earned.
- That's what I object to.</i>

177
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,457
The new Dean of Medicine
has an ethical obligation

178
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,080
to come in with a completely open mind

179
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,719
<i>about all employees,</i>

180
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,476
thus letting me blithely run roughshod

181
00:07:26,476 --> 00:07:27,931
for at least four weeks.

182
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:30,524
My theory is that you're
running a battery of tests

183
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:32,582
<i>to convince him that you saved his life,</i>

184
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,339
then con him into funding
you to hire back your team.

185
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,096
- What?
- Your old team?

186
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:37,333
What?

187
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,705
<i>This is your new reality.</i>

188
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:39,776
You've got your office.

189
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,031
You've got neighbors.

190
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:43,122
You've got one employee, one volunteer.

191
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:44,243
<i>Until she finds actual, paid work,</i>

192
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:46,367
<i>or gets sick of you.</i>

193
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:47,506
I talked to Chase and Taub.

194
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:48,876
They're willing to come back.

195
00:07:48,876 --> 00:07:50,433
What about Thirteen?

196
00:07:50,433 --> 00:07:52,190
Not a good choice.

197
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,573
She's not long term because
she has no long term.

198
00:07:56,573 --> 00:07:57,627
Not taking your calls?

199
00:07:59,468 --> 00:08:00,638
She will.

200
00:08:00,638 --> 00:08:02,060
Discharge the patient.

201
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,951
Unexplained loss of consciousness

202
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,607
could be cardiomyopathy,

203
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:07,949
global anoxia, subarachnoid hemorrhage--

204
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:09,304
dehydration.

205
00:08:09,304 --> 00:08:10,760
<i>He was given fluids, and he got better.</i>

206
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,266
<i>And I'm sure your tests have
come up negative,</i>

207
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:13,805
or you would have shut me up already.

208
00:08:13,805 --> 00:08:15,310
Which means he goes home.

209
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,162
<i>There is a symptom...</i>

210
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:22,036
Extreme altruism.

211
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,544
You've got two choices, House.

212
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:30,167
You can recognize that your patient

213
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,723
is just a very nice, healthy guy,

214
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:33,011
and send him home,

215
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:35,771
or you can consider altruism a symptom.

216
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:37,729
In which case, you cannot take his money.

217
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,358
Send him home.

218
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,596
And check with admitting

219
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:48,370
for the net worth of all new patients.

220
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:02,623
<i>I'm not coming back, House.</i>

221
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:08,228
Technically, you're back right now.

222
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:12,694
I need you to stop calling me.

223
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:14,836
First 17 messages were cute, but--

224
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:17,262
I'm putting the band back together.

225
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:19,520
Interesting that you never
showed up at my place,

226
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,825
what with your love of annoying me

227
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,736
and your inability to take no for an answer.

228
00:09:23,736 --> 00:09:25,460
I'm guessing ankle monitor.

229
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,699
Guilty as charged.

230
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:33,206
Literally.

231
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:36,685
I'm not a doctor anymore, House.

232
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:40,818
The job went away, but not the profession.

233
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:42,741
You look healthy, so...

234
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:43,662
That's not it.

235
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:47,594
You met a boy.

236
00:09:47,594 --> 00:09:48,831
Or a girl.

237
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:51,559
Fall in love, wanna be happy.

238
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,372
You decided to... Enjoy
what time you have left.

239
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:58,919
You're going to Thailand.

240
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:02,382
Girl.

241
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:04,323
And Mykonos.

242
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:08,071
Turns out I like boring.

243
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:09,961
No, you wanna like boring.

244
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:11,467
But if you actually liked boring,

245
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,855
you would have figured
that out in fifth grade,

246
00:10:12,855 --> 00:10:14,111
when you were bored.

247
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:15,934
Please stop calling me.

248
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:20,049
No.

249
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:24,099
<i>You showed up</i>

250
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:25,637
to tell me that you don't
want to hear from me.

251
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:27,862
That's a mixed signal.

252
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:29,669
I will choose to listen to your actions

253
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,594
rather than your words.

254
00:10:31,594 --> 00:10:32,664
They're more honest.

255
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:41,330
I'm a little confused.

256
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,639
The test is designed to
determine if you're--

257
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:46,751
No, I mean your running a
test and discharging me.

258
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:48,826
Was I dehydrated or not?

259
00:10:48,826 --> 00:10:50,080
I think so.

260
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,121
But, out of an abundance of caution,

261
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:53,543
my colleague has taken it upon herself

262
00:10:53,543 --> 00:10:54,949
to do one more test.

263
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:56,437
All right.

264
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,038
You scare me a little.

265
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:04,149
Why?

266
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:07,228
I've been considering

267
00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:08,767
applying to Doctors Without Borders.

268
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,139
Going overseas a while,

269
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:12,498
and that seems like a huge sacrifice.

270
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:13,836
But...You--

271
00:11:13,836 --> 00:11:15,041
<i>you don't scare her.</i>

272
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,513
You make her feel guilty.

273
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:19,676
Oh, you...

274
00:11:19,676 --> 00:11:21,583
You like your life that way it is.

275
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,356
<i>Most people give the minimum
they have to give</i>

276
00:11:23,356 --> 00:11:25,213
<i>so they can enjoy what they have left.</i>

277
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:26,551
<i>I guess my minimum is just...</i>

278
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:29,596
Higher than most.

279
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:31,353
<i>Complete recruitment and
interference pattern.</i>

280
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:32,825
His leg muscles are fine.

281
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,535
I feel, uh, funny.

282
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:36,589
Where?

283
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:37,794
My chest.

284
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:38,966
You're tachycardic.

285
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:39,768
Your heart's beating too fast.

286
00:11:39,768 --> 00:11:41,725
Unbelievable.

287
00:11:49,007 --> 00:11:51,203
Patient got tachycardic to 185.

288
00:11:51,203 --> 00:11:53,829
We pushed 18 milligrams adenosine.

289
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:56,189
There's definitely something wrong with him.

290
00:11:56,189 --> 00:11:57,310
Which is awesome.

291
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,317
Now there's something to cure,

292
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,789
which means there's something to be

293
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:03,466
disproportionately financially grateful for.

294
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:04,720
Morning.

295
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,544
Got you a coffee.

296
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:07,882
Thanks.

297
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:09,722
Arrhythmia could easily
have caused the collapse

298
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:13,922
that landed Father Teresa
in here in the first place.

299
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:16,248
Oh, that's fine. Keep it.

300
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:17,519
<i>We looked at his heart yesterday,</i>

301
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,226
<i>didn't see any structural abnormalities.</i>

302
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:21,534
I'm thinking occult long QT syndrome?

303
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:22,739
What about Whipple's?

304
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:23,960
If it was Whipple's, there'd be

305
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,048
some kind of neurological involvement.

306
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:26,386
You don't think defying human nature

307
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:27,674
is neurological?

308
00:12:27,674 --> 00:12:29,682
Racing heart: Medical condition.

309
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,489
Bleeding heart: Stupid condition.

310
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,246
Are you saying that because you believe it,

311
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:36,257
<i>or because it's in your
financial best interest</i>

312
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:38,599
to think his generosity
isn't just temporary?

313
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:41,510
I'm told that some people are just nice.

314
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,070
I'm trying to embrace that wisdom.

315
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,910
Benjamin's been taking allergy medication

316
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,082
the last few weeks.

317
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:49,390
Long QT syndrome can be medication-induced.

318
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:51,733
Flush him with saline,
get rid of the antihistamines,

319
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,856
then do an EKG.

320
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,948
No, wait. I'll do the flushing.

321
00:12:57,455 --> 00:12:59,093
Take the damn $2.00.

322
00:12:59,093 --> 00:13:00,465
She hasn't even sipped the coffee.

323
00:13:04,315 --> 00:13:07,408
I just got so angry. You know?

324
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:10,387
So I made a terrible mistake.

325
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:13,180
Now I'm trying to start my life over.

326
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,526
To help people the way I always wanted.

327
00:13:16,526 --> 00:13:19,504
But my department got defunded, and...

328
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:22,666
it's my fault.

329
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,691
Just can't stand to think
of all those patients

330
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:27,618
going untreated because I
don't have the resources

331
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:29,392
to do my best work.

332
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,503
How about I help you out?

333
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:35,565
How do you mean?

334
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,827
I'll give $1 million as an
endowment to the hospital,

335
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:40,567
earmarked for diagnostics.

336
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:43,512
Wow.

337
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:47,644
I am an opportunistic ex-con

338
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:50,204
who just gave you a two-minute sob story

339
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,830
as step three in my master plan,

340
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,691
and you've offered me $1 million.

341
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:57,515
Which is step 17.

342
00:13:59,808 --> 00:14:00,643
Is that bad?

343
00:14:03,287 --> 00:14:04,658
Ethics are not my strong suit.

344
00:14:07,604 --> 00:14:08,941
<i>Hypothetical--</i>

345
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:11,317
if I'm offered oral sex

346
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,245
from a sexaholic, do I have to decline?

347
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:15,584
<i>Don't answer yet.</i>

348
00:14:15,584 --> 00:14:18,209
Saying no will cause both of us pain.

349
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,318
Saying yes will cause both of us pleasure.

350
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,761
You can't take sex from a sexaholic.

351
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,734
You can't give booze to an alcoholic,

352
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,591
and you can't take this guy's money.

353
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:27,880
Could be wrong about the symptom.

354
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,469
I'm wrong all the time.

355
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,691
<i>Taking money from a sick person</i>

356
00:14:30,691 --> 00:14:33,032
is ethically suspect at best.

357
00:14:33,032 --> 00:14:34,371
<i>What is this, Canada?</i>

358
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:36,612
All we do is take money from sick people.

359
00:14:36,612 --> 00:14:37,583
We work for it.

360
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,922
I'm working!

361
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:40,226
How much?

362
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:42,569
$20.

363
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:44,810
<i>Well, what if it was?</i>

364
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,417
<i>It's the same principle.</i>

365
00:14:46,417 --> 00:14:48,558
$20, $1 million... What's the difference?

366
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:52,272
Actually, the difference
is pretty much $1 million.

367
00:14:52,272 --> 00:14:54,196
He came up with the figure, not me.

368
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:56,705
Crap.

369
00:14:56,705 --> 00:15:00,570
Got a patient with end stage renal disease.

370
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,892
<i>Her heart can't support dialysis.</i>

371
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:04,067
She needs a transplant, but...

372
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,890
you tuned out as soon as
it stopped being about you,

373
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,229
didn't you?

374
00:15:07,229 --> 00:15:08,734
- What?
- I gotta go.

375
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:10,173
It's all moot.

376
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:12,130
Patient probably has long QT.

377
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,226
Probably just a really,
really decent person.

378
00:15:15,226 --> 00:15:16,480
They exist, right?

379
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,869
You can't take the money, House.

380
00:15:19,308 --> 00:15:20,311
<i>Is long QT bad?</i>

381
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:25,264
It's a tough thing to control.

382
00:15:25,264 --> 00:15:27,388
Is there someone you want me to call?

383
00:15:28,945 --> 00:15:31,320
There's someone I would like to call.

384
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,829
She's the same person
who won't take my calls.

385
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:36,674
My wife.

386
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:42,294
When I started giving away the money, I--

387
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:43,834
I hoped she'd want to do it with me.

388
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:45,942
She didn't.

389
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:49,941
I miss them.

390
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,952
I have two little boys.

391
00:15:56,917 --> 00:15:58,322
Having a family doesn't exempt me

392
00:15:58,322 --> 00:15:59,761
from social responsibility.

393
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,534
But family comes first.

394
00:16:01,534 --> 00:16:03,542
It should.

395
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,486
I know that sounds weird, but...

396
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:07,791
someone who's related to you,

397
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:10,301
does that empirically
make them more special?

398
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,075
More deserving than anyone else?

399
00:16:12,075 --> 00:16:14,718
Yes, it gives you a responsibility.

400
00:16:14,718 --> 00:16:17,127
My boys have a roof over their heads.

401
00:16:17,127 --> 00:16:18,682
They're not starving.

402
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:23,986
I pay court-ordered child support,

403
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:25,960
and, frankly, it's, uh...

404
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,068
more than they need.

405
00:16:28,068 --> 00:16:31,548
I love them more than anything, I just...

406
00:16:31,548 --> 00:16:33,606
I can't justify buying video games

407
00:16:33,606 --> 00:16:34,910
and private schools

408
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,700
when other people's children are starving.

409
00:16:39,445 --> 00:16:41,786
I hope, one day, they'll understand that.

410
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,651
Your hands are trembling.

411
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:46,939
Is it the electrodes?

412
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:47,994
Are you in pain?

413
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:48,746
No.

414
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,256
What's happening?

415
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:53,129
I'm not sure, but it's not
what we thought it was.

416
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,993
So...

417
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,472
arrhythmia, fainting, muscle tremors.

418
00:17:00,472 --> 00:17:01,700
Plus, unfortunately, mental changes.

419
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:09,796
I still don't think it's neurological.

420
00:17:10,786 --> 00:17:11,801
God bless you.

421
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:13,192
He lost his wife and
kids because she couldn't

422
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:14,713
stop giving money away.

423
00:17:14,713 --> 00:17:16,294
He lost his wife because she couldn't

424
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:17,893
accept not being filthy rich.

425
00:17:19,114 --> 00:17:20,909
She's not drinking the coffee either.

426
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,311
Drink it, don't drink it.

427
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:23,817
The point is, I gave it to you,

428
00:17:23,817 --> 00:17:25,154
so we're even.

429
00:17:26,411 --> 00:17:27,447
Even?

430
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:28,734
It was a gift.

431
00:17:28,734 --> 00:17:30,007
An insignificant token.

432
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,412
There was nothing owed.

433
00:17:31,412 --> 00:17:33,052
That was the whole point.

434
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,038
Why?

435
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:35,761
Why?

436
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,267
Yeah, why?

437
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:39,660
She's the crazy one.

438
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,843
So a guy gives everything Sane.

439
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:47,640
Girl who doesn't want anything
from a stranger is crazy.

440
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,145
You're not a stranger.

441
00:17:49,145 --> 00:17:50,919
And your perverse view of the world

442
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:52,692
is making you force a neurological component

443
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:54,800
onto an obviously cardiological--

444
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,222
Your parents didn't love you enough.

445
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,900
So you need to prove your superiority.

446
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,987
Or they love you too much,

447
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:02,245
so you need to prove your humility.

448
00:18:02,245 --> 00:18:04,504
Or it's just rich guilt.

449
00:18:04,504 --> 00:18:05,759
I'm betting on the last one.

450
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,443
There's a whole list of drugs

451
00:18:10,443 --> 00:18:11,832
that could have caused his symptoms.

452
00:18:11,832 --> 00:18:13,589
I doubt the guy would spend money on drugs

453
00:18:13,589 --> 00:18:14,760
when there are orphans out there

454
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,930
without cable.

455
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,453
Anyway, he'd be getting better right now,

456
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:18,624
not worse.

457
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:20,766
Could be polyarteritis nodosa.

458
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,275
That comes with a rash.

459
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:25,584
Echovirus.

460
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,056
Virus, virus, virus, virus...

461
00:18:27,056 --> 00:18:29,064
Fits his physical symptoms.

462
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:30,736
And could,

463
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,761
but doesn't necessarily
cause personality changes.

464
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:35,538
Works for everyone?

465
00:18:35,538 --> 00:18:38,164
Start him on antivirals.

466
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:40,021
And, Adams...

467
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:41,193
when you treat,

468
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:42,682
and he gets better,

469
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:45,023
and doesn't give Bob
Cratchit Christmas day off,

470
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,246
you owe me a coffee.

471
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:51,850
<i>Click the third tab from the left</i>

472
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,192
<i>and find the box that says
"previous entries."</i>

473
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:56,099
<i>You get a drop-down menu
sorted by patient name</i>

474
00:18:56,099 --> 00:18:57,906
<i>and department.</i>

475
00:18:57,906 --> 00:18:58,910
Thank you.

476
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,415
<i>Appreciate your help.</i>

477
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:02,022
You're gonna read too much
into this, aren't you?

478
00:19:02,022 --> 00:19:03,176
No, not at all.

479
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,615
We're gonna fundamentally disagree

480
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:06,372
about what it means to
read too much into this.

481
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:07,326
<i>Aren't we?</i>

482
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:09,952
Yes, absolutely.

483
00:19:09,952 --> 00:19:11,725
Look, I thought about what you said,

484
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:12,896
and I realized you were right.

485
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:15,406
Great. See you tomorrow morning.

486
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:16,811
No, you won't.

487
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:18,651
Afternoon?

488
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:19,990
<i>I can't think of another interpretation.</i>

489
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,027
Shut up.

490
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:22,834
<i>Look, I'm not sure</i>

491
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:24,005
what you were trying to achieve.

492
00:19:24,005 --> 00:19:25,142
I'm never quite sure.

493
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:26,548
But you were actually a friend to me

494
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:28,689
when I needed it.

495
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:30,630
<i>I don't wanna come back to work for you.</i>

496
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,943
But I was wrong to try to
push you out of my life.

497
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:38,058
Everything has gone blue.

498
00:19:38,058 --> 00:19:41,371
<i>That's not supposed to happen, right?</i>

499
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:44,415
Stay there. I'm comin'.

500
00:19:44,415 --> 00:19:45,470
No...You don't have to do that.

501
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,761
Although, if you did come,

502
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:49,602
maybe you could swing by the Hunan Palace

503
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:51,844
and get some lo mein and a szechuan beef.

504
00:19:51,844 --> 00:19:53,919
That is six miles out of my way.

505
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,391
<i>Oh, okay, then.</i>

506
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:57,398
Guess I'll get something
from the hospital cafeteria,

507
00:19:57,398 --> 00:19:59,038
which is where I get all my meals

508
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,577
since I can't go anywhere.

509
00:20:00,577 --> 00:20:02,450
Fine.

510
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,672
I'll get the food.

511
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:04,542
<i>You're a peach.</i>

512
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,735
I started the last round of pleconaril.

513
00:20:11,735 --> 00:20:13,241
Can you do me a favor?

514
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:15,199
A favor?

515
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,459
You want me to return these?

516
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:23,781
Give them to someone?

517
00:20:23,781 --> 00:20:26,090
Wear them while you masturbate?

518
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:29,603
I...want you to have them.

519
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,896
That's not a favor.

520
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:34,104
It was a two-for-one sale.
I couldn't resist.

521
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:35,626
I need to justify buying them.

522
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:38,136
They're $120.

523
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:39,591
My car is in the shop.

524
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:41,733
I'm short on cash this month.

525
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:43,523
I can't pay you back.

526
00:20:43,523 --> 00:20:45,112
The first pair were $120.

527
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:47,036
These...were free.

528
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:50,265
You do know I punched

529
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:51,737
the last person that pissed me off?

530
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:54,481
Was it Santa?

531
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,419
What's your patient's status?

532
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:14,791
Better.

533
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,230
We're discharging him.

534
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,735
Good.

535
00:21:19,243 --> 00:21:20,831
Hey, hey, hey.

536
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:22,889
Why do you care?

537
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:24,294
Specifically.

538
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:26,436
Although I'm curious about
a general answer too.

539
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:28,610
Your guy just signed up to donate a kidney

540
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,183
to my patient with renal failure.

541
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,466
Did he meet your patient with renal failure?

542
00:21:34,466 --> 00:21:36,892
No, he heard the nurses talking about her,

543
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:38,447
that she was short on time.

544
00:21:40,656 --> 00:21:41,543
I was wrong.

545
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:42,864
Don't say that.

546
00:21:42,864 --> 00:21:45,223
House, she really needs this kidney.

547
00:21:45,223 --> 00:21:46,813
He's not better.

548
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:48,235
His mental status is declining.

549
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:50,610
Or he's doing an amazing thing

550
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,500
for another human being.

551
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,957
I thought it was an ethical no-brainer

552
00:21:53,957 --> 00:21:56,298
that we can't take stuff from sick people.

553
00:21:56,298 --> 00:21:58,641
I changed my mind.

554
00:22:06,097 --> 00:22:07,183
He's still sick.

555
00:22:07,183 --> 00:22:08,438
His symptoms have gone away.

556
00:22:08,438 --> 00:22:09,894
Not all of them.

557
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:11,617
Offering an organ to a stranger

558
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:12,956
<i>is a symptom.</i>

559
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,076
A couple dozen people a year

560
00:22:14,076 --> 00:22:15,665
make undirected kidney donations.

561
00:22:15,665 --> 00:22:17,255
Yeah, how many of them
are also in the process

562
00:22:17,255 --> 00:22:18,643
of pauperizing themselves?

563
00:22:18,643 --> 00:22:20,183
If the guy threw himself on a grenade,

564
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:21,354
he'd be a hero.

565
00:22:21,354 --> 00:22:23,327
If it saves a life, who cares?

566
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:24,666
You do!

567
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:28,129
Yesterday, when you made the
exact opposite argument.

568
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:30,020
If there's even a chance I'm right,

569
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,111
it'd be dangerous to give
his kidney to someone else.

570
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:33,851
More dangerous than complete renal failure?

571
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:35,207
My patient needs this.

572
00:22:35,207 --> 00:22:36,377
Now.

573
00:22:36,377 --> 00:22:38,134
Why do you wanna give away your kidney?

574
00:22:38,134 --> 00:22:40,928
There are 70,000 people in this country

575
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:42,283
on the active waiting list for a kidney,

576
00:22:42,283 --> 00:22:43,755
and less than 10,000 dead people a year

577
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:44,893
to give them one.

578
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:46,164
Yeah.

579
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,205
If only we could kill
60,000 more people a year,

580
00:22:48,205 --> 00:22:49,678
all would be golden.

581
00:22:49,678 --> 00:22:50,682
I'll give you your money.

582
00:22:50,682 --> 00:22:52,773
See? Crazy.

583
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:54,428
Being a live donor has risks.

584
00:22:54,428 --> 00:22:55,667
I looked it up.

585
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,005
The risk is 1 in 4,000

586
00:22:57,005 --> 00:22:58,110
I could die during surgery,

587
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,385
which means, if I don't donate,

588
00:23:00,385 --> 00:23:02,761
I'm valuing my life at
4,000 times someone else's.

589
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,487
<i>It's not like I want to be</i>

590
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:06,876
cut open and have a part of me taken out.

591
00:23:06,876 --> 00:23:09,720
But I've got two, and this woman has none.

592
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,259
She'll die without it.

593
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:13,970
Perfectly logical.

594
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:16,413
People with mental
deficiency can be logical.

595
00:23:16,413 --> 00:23:18,236
Just like sane people can be illogical.

596
00:23:18,236 --> 00:23:19,792
This kidney thing is the
only evidence you have

597
00:23:19,792 --> 00:23:20,829
that he's sick.

598
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:24,710
I'm gonna let him be a donor.

599
00:23:29,864 --> 00:23:30,900
<i>Dr. House,</i>

600
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,410
it's not a symptom.

601
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,451
Come back after you're
convinced that I'm healthy,

602
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:37,358
and I will give you your money.

603
00:23:37,358 --> 00:23:39,315
No, you won't.

604
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:46,342
We have time for one more test

605
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,513
before we move him.

606
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:48,651
What test?

607
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:49,772
Whatever test will prove

608
00:23:49,772 --> 00:23:51,980
there was an echovirus-irus-irus,

609
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,004
and he's not cured, obviously.

610
00:23:54,004 --> 00:23:55,845
I've been saying all along
this could be Whipple's.

611
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:57,936
Causes arrhythmia, tremor,

612
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,843
and mental changes.

613
00:23:59,843 --> 00:24:01,232
Bad idea.

614
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,519
There's no joint pain.

615
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:03,909
Where's Adams?

616
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,364
We thought the case was over.

617
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:06,368
She has a job interview.

618
00:24:11,321 --> 00:24:13,027
Why is she here?

619
00:24:13,027 --> 00:24:14,699
<i>'Cause I called her.</i>

620
00:24:14,699 --> 00:24:17,878
Bigger question is why that worked.

621
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:19,350
I'm here because I have time

622
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,421
and you have a crisis and I--

623
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:22,228
we're too busy for rationalizations.

624
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,872
Patient made a big downgrade
in his personal life.

625
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:26,461
He's probably not eating all that healthy.

626
00:24:26,461 --> 00:24:28,251
Magnesium deficiency?

627
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:32,349
<i>Wait until they take him back to his room--
draw blood,</i>

628
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:34,659
do an expanded electrolyte profile.

629
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:35,746
<i>No, he hasn't had</i>

630
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:37,285
anxiety or any trouble sleeping.

631
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:38,507
I think it's Whipple's disease.

632
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,999
Bad idea. He doesn't have joint pain.

633
00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:42,722
<i>Joint pain is common, but not definitive.</i>

634
00:24:42,722 --> 00:24:44,680
<i>Whipple's explains all of his symptoms,</i>

635
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,854
<i>including the personality change.</i>

636
00:24:46,854 --> 00:24:48,360
And it would respond to antibiotics,

637
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,882
which is why he started to feel better.

638
00:24:49,882 --> 00:24:51,556
Which doesn't mean he's not still sick.

639
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:52,760
You were right.

640
00:24:54,216 --> 00:24:55,721
Counts for nothing if you can't defend it.

641
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:57,947
Book a procedure room.

642
00:24:57,947 --> 00:25:01,544
Do an upper endoscopy and run
a PCR test for Whipple's.

643
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,157
Guilt.

644
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:08,871
You feel guilty about leaving.

645
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:10,210
<i>Yes, I think that little of you</i>

646
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,214
and that much of me.

647
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:12,468
You're nothing without me.

648
00:25:12,468 --> 00:25:13,623
<i>Not leaving me.</i>

649
00:25:13,623 --> 00:25:15,095
Leaving humanity.

650
00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:17,906
I'm going with my girlfriend.

651
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:19,411
The woman I love.

652
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:20,649
To have fun.

653
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:23,878
You're trying to make me feel guilty

654
00:25:23,878 --> 00:25:25,267
because you're saving lives here.

655
00:25:25,267 --> 00:25:26,672
And I think that's great.

656
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:28,144
I'm proud to have been a part of it,

657
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:31,206
but...now...

658
00:25:31,206 --> 00:25:32,377
I just wanna be happy.

659
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,510
Oh...no one's unhappy in Greece.

660
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:42,332
<i>It just appeared in the last few weeks.</i>

661
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,590
<i>He's having trouble holding
a pencil in school.</i>

662
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,544
Does it itch?

663
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:49,442
Do anything different lately?

664
00:25:49,442 --> 00:25:52,286
You get a new baseball glove, a new kitten?

665
00:25:52,286 --> 00:25:53,707
Well, the neighbors put in a pool,

666
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:55,280
so he's been spending a
lot of time over there.

667
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,505
But, well, if it was something in the water,

668
00:25:57,505 --> 00:25:59,429
it would be everywhere, wouldn't it?

669
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:05,820
It is in the water.

670
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,125
He's allergic to chlorine?

671
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,965
No...

672
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:12,864
He's allergic to summer lilac.

673
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,905
That's my lotion.

674
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:16,627
And it's not in the pool.

675
00:26:16,627 --> 00:26:19,573
No, it's on the palms of his hands.

676
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:22,484
In the pool is the neighbor's daughter.

677
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:26,197
Or the neighbor's hot wife.

678
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:32,270
Here's some lube.

679
00:26:33,895 --> 00:26:35,784
Sorry. Too late for your eyesight.

680
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:48,030
Endoscopy didn't reveal any lesions

681
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,369
in the small intestine.

682
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:52,681
I'm running PCR test now.

683
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:56,195
Found it in my office.

684
00:26:56,195 --> 00:26:58,352
Appears to be a gift.

685
00:26:58,352 --> 00:26:59,323
That can't be good.

686
00:27:00,997 --> 00:27:01,983
Damn it.

687
00:27:01,983 --> 00:27:04,058
You got her the job interview.

688
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:05,312
And that was supposed to be the end of it.

689
00:27:05,312 --> 00:27:07,571
I...don't take charity.

690
00:27:07,571 --> 00:27:09,528
Good for you! You loon.

691
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,736
I don't like owing people things.

692
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:14,179
So either you're so insecure

693
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:16,522
that you feel like you need
to always have the upper hand,

694
00:27:16,522 --> 00:27:17,809
or you're so arrogant

695
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:20,152
that the notion of a favor
is insulting to you.

696
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:21,373
Or it's your family,

697
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:23,548
some kind of immigrant pride thing.

698
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:25,622
I'm betting on the last one.

699
00:27:25,622 --> 00:27:27,178
I just don't like it.

700
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:30,808
It makes me feel...Icky.

701
00:27:30,808 --> 00:27:33,168
That's the reason? Ickiness?

702
00:27:33,168 --> 00:27:35,878
You never even tried to analyze this?

703
00:27:35,878 --> 00:27:38,354
It's even crazier than the gift thing.

704
00:27:38,354 --> 00:27:39,943
House...

705
00:27:39,943 --> 00:27:42,152
there's no sign of tropheryma DNA.

706
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:44,260
It's not Whipple's.

707
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,283
Well...we did what we could.

708
00:27:55,286 --> 00:27:57,008
You sure you wanna do this?

709
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:57,730
Relax.

710
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:02,061
This is gonna make me very happy.

711
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:13,102
<i>Go a little bit more along here.</i>

712
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:20,146
Dr. Simpson.

713
00:28:20,146 --> 00:28:21,802
<i>Heart rate's 140, pressure's dropping.</i>

714
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:23,174
Get him adenosine, stat.

715
00:28:23,174 --> 00:28:25,515
<i>Patient's unstable. Surgery's off.</i>

716
00:28:29,697 --> 00:28:30,833
Arrhythmia's back.

717
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:32,205
He's on Heparin and stable for now,

718
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:33,480
but this could put him at risk

719
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,735
for stroke or embolism.

720
00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:36,207
Maybe he got bit by a spider.

721
00:28:36,207 --> 00:28:38,717
The symptoms can take up
to three days to manifest.

722
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,888
He'd have localized pain.

723
00:28:39,888 --> 00:28:41,093
LCDD?

724
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:42,264
Almost always hits the kidneys.

725
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:45,141
Ah, Dr. Foreman.

726
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:46,915
Perhaps you can help us.

727
00:28:46,915 --> 00:28:49,759
<i>I can't decide whether to take out an
"I told you so" ad</i>

728
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,501
<i>in the New England Journal or stay classy</i>

729
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:54,693
and just spray-paint it on your car.

730
00:28:54,693 --> 00:28:56,065
You're off the case.

731
00:28:56,065 --> 00:28:58,625
That seems like an overreaction.

732
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,165
You dosed him.

733
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:01,938
<i>Couldn't stand to lose him as a patient,</i>

734
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:03,142
<i>so you faked his symptom to prove you right.</i>

735
00:29:03,142 --> 00:29:04,113
That's idiotic.

736
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,722
Sorry.

737
00:29:06,722 --> 00:29:08,028
<i>Don't apologize.</i>

738
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:11,240
I don't know if you're
power crazed or paranoid,

739
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,544
but I know she's right.

740
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:14,519
Two lives are in the balance here.

741
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,811
House, I worked for you for seven years.

742
00:29:16,811 --> 00:29:18,099
I know how you operate.

743
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:19,956
So when I see symptoms magically show up

744
00:29:19,956 --> 00:29:21,210
right when you need them--

745
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,917
<i>And I was your boss for seven years.</i>

746
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:26,013
And I know what a suspicious,
micromanaging hard-ass you are.

747
00:29:26,013 --> 00:29:28,104
<i>Why would I do this now?</i>

748
00:29:28,104 --> 00:29:30,646
Knowing you can send me right back to jail?

749
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:31,751
What'd you give him?

750
00:29:31,751 --> 00:29:32,988
Nothing!

751
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:34,628
You can't prove otherwise.

752
00:29:34,628 --> 00:29:37,874
So why don't you do the smart thing here?

753
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:40,182
You're off the case.

754
00:29:40,182 --> 00:29:42,709
You no longer have access to this patient.

755
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,544
You can't let him do this.

756
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:49,769
He's the boss.

757
00:29:51,894 --> 00:29:52,798
And he's right.

758
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:05,830
I assume you dosed the patient

759
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,453
because you're really certain

760
00:30:07,453 --> 00:30:09,645
he has a neurological condition?

761
00:30:09,645 --> 00:30:11,401
I assume you're interpreting my actions

762
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:12,990
in the best possible light

763
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,412
'cause you didn't get the job?

764
00:30:16,087 --> 00:30:18,846
What's with you and Park?

765
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:19,809
Nothing.

766
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:25,789
I expect my people to lie better than that.

767
00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:27,914
Either you're getting her gifts because

768
00:30:27,914 --> 00:30:30,707
you want her to like you,
in which case I don't like you,

769
00:30:30,707 --> 00:30:33,652
or you're getting her
gifts to screw with her.

770
00:30:33,652 --> 00:30:35,191
In which case, I will be teaching you

771
00:30:35,191 --> 00:30:37,249
my secret homey handshake.

772
00:30:39,927 --> 00:30:42,552
I just...I thought it was interesting

773
00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:44,610
she couldn't accept that coffee.

774
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,655
I wanted to see how deep it went.

775
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:48,826
But now?

776
00:30:48,826 --> 00:30:51,419
Oh, now I just want to win.

777
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:55,518
What was in the box?

778
00:30:55,518 --> 00:30:57,241
Gift certificate.

779
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:59,148
The spa.

780
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,754
Nah, that's not gonna do it.

781
00:31:00,754 --> 00:31:03,800
You're up against a lifetime of training.

782
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,171
If you wanna win, you gotta do something

783
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:07,865
she can't possibly reciprocate.

784
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:09,688
You gotta push her neuroses to the point

785
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:11,830
where even she thinks that she's crazy.

786
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:25,749
One more favor.

787
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:28,225
Then I promise,
I'll leave you alone forever.

788
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:29,899
Or I'm lying.

789
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:31,739
Either way, it's more interesting

790
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:32,993
than whatever you're doing now.

791
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:43,332
Can I help you?

792
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:46,343
I'm his wife.

793
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:47,967
We're separated.

794
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:49,305
I heard he was sick.

795
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:52,116
I just... Wanted to see him.

796
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:56,984
He's giving a kidney to
someone he's never met?

797
00:31:58,642 --> 00:31:59,745
He wants to, yeah.

798
00:32:01,937 --> 00:32:03,994
I know he's talked about you.

799
00:32:03,994 --> 00:32:05,784
He's been alone all this time.

800
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:06,955
I'm sure it would mean a lot to him

801
00:32:06,955 --> 00:32:07,959
to see you.

802
00:32:10,018 --> 00:32:12,593
I wanted to spend my life with him, but...

803
00:32:15,438 --> 00:32:19,921
I need to feel like he loves
me more than other people.

804
00:32:19,921 --> 00:32:22,012
Like he loves our kids more.

805
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,445
Maybe that's selfish.

806
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:34,509
I should go.

807
00:32:45,552 --> 00:32:46,606
Was that my wife?

808
00:32:46,606 --> 00:32:49,835
I don't know.

809
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:51,273
You the guy, the kidney donor?

810
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:57,095
There was a problem, but...

811
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:58,199
I'm gonna try again.

812
00:32:58,199 --> 00:33:03,185
Um...to give it to the same lady?

813
00:33:03,185 --> 00:33:05,510
She needs it.

814
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,685
Okay. Never mind.

815
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,609
Wait.

816
00:33:09,609 --> 00:33:11,165
What do you-- what do you want?

817
00:33:11,165 --> 00:33:14,360
Uh, it's nothing. It's just...

818
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:22,658
I have polycystic kidney disease.

819
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:23,997
And I need a transplant,

820
00:33:23,997 --> 00:33:25,336
and they say I don't have much time,

821
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,557
so when I heard that you were willing,

822
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:27,929
I just...

823
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:30,823
But I'm glad it's going to someone.

824
00:33:34,036 --> 00:33:35,106
I'll give it to you.

825
00:33:39,323 --> 00:33:41,112
But you already promised it to someone else.

826
00:33:41,112 --> 00:33:42,618
I have another one.

827
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:45,880
Saving one life is good.

828
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,586
Saving two is better.

829
00:33:47,586 --> 00:33:50,013
You give away two kidneys, and you die.

830
00:33:50,013 --> 00:33:52,639
I could live on dialyses for years.

831
00:33:52,639 --> 00:33:54,864
Yes, and-- and then you die.

832
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:56,922
And then I could donate my other organs.

833
00:33:56,922 --> 00:33:58,962
Heart, lungs.

834
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,459
I could save four or five more lives.

835
00:34:20,745 --> 00:34:23,054
Foreman's gonna need a diagnostician.

836
00:34:23,054 --> 00:34:26,032
This guy is crazy.

837
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:32,262
<i>Arrhythmia, muscle tremors,</i>

838
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:33,467
and, yes, mental changes.

839
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:34,806
If his heart doesn't rupture,

840
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,646
he's liable to rip it out and give it away.

841
00:34:36,646 --> 00:34:38,403
You know, the "down" vibe in here

842
00:34:38,403 --> 00:34:41,597
<i>is totally ruining my Charlie's
Angels fantasy.</i>

843
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:44,960
And that haircut isn't helping, either.

844
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,901
<i>It seems like Graves disease</i>

845
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:48,942
or some other thyroid issue.

846
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:50,248
Is she on the team now?

847
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:51,703
Like, forever?

848
00:34:54,163 --> 00:34:56,554
His thyroid levels were within normal range

849
00:34:56,554 --> 00:34:57,843
when he was admitted.

850
00:34:57,843 --> 00:35:00,034
Could be Coxsackie B virus.

851
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:01,540
Or pericarditis.

852
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,795
What about porphyria?

853
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:04,234
It's a little weird without the rash,

854
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:05,472
<i>but it fits all of his other symptoms.</i>

855
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,730
And if it is acute intermittent porphyria,

856
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,989
that would explain why his
symptoms keep recurring.

857
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:12,364
It's unlikely... but it's possible.

858
00:35:12,364 --> 00:35:13,117
What else?

859
00:35:15,544 --> 00:35:17,015
I said what else?

860
00:35:20,596 --> 00:35:22,988
Oh, for...

861
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,550
There. That's better.

862
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,642
Now, what else?

863
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:50,341
Well, if there's nothing
better than possible,

864
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:52,600
then possible gets upgraded to probable.

865
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,106
I'll start him on hematin.

866
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:55,578
No, I'll go.

867
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,264
So what's the answer?

868
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,289
Are you now on the team?

869
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:09,213
Like, forever?

870
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:11,221
I don't know.

871
00:36:11,221 --> 00:36:13,764
'Cause I was thinking of ordering T-shirts.

872
00:36:13,764 --> 00:36:15,905
I don't know...House.

873
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:17,327
I mean, what am I supposed to do?

874
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:19,987
I trained to be a Doctor.

875
00:36:19,987 --> 00:36:22,045
I know how to take someone's pain away,

876
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:24,403
how to make a stopped heart beat again.

877
00:36:24,403 --> 00:36:26,780
We've brought people's kids back.

878
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:30,042
Their husbands...

879
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:32,200
So...guilt?

880
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,705
Yes, you were right.

881
00:36:33,705 --> 00:36:34,977
You're always right.

882
00:36:34,977 --> 00:36:37,420
I just...

883
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,230
I have the skills to help people.

884
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,238
Is it okay for me to walk away from that

885
00:36:42,238 --> 00:36:45,618
because I...want to just have fun?

886
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:48,812
Obviously not.

887
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:01,176
How's your patient?

888
00:37:03,168 --> 00:37:05,191
She died a few hours ago.

889
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,338
Thirteen is back.

890
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:19,429
No department. No money.

891
00:37:19,429 --> 00:37:21,403
And somehow, you managed to con her

892
00:37:21,403 --> 00:37:22,407
into hanging around.

893
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:25,000
I have a gift.

894
00:37:30,689 --> 00:37:31,592
What?

895
00:37:31,592 --> 00:37:33,432
It was a con.

896
00:37:33,432 --> 00:37:35,607
The patient was faking?

897
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:37,162
No, I was.

898
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:43,269
I brought him in here under false pretenses.

899
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:45,611
Just to get his money.

900
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:47,250
I ordered a bunch of random tests

901
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,372
to keep him here.

902
00:37:48,372 --> 00:37:50,998
One of them was a head CT, which uses...

903
00:37:50,998 --> 00:37:52,905
Iodine contrast.

904
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:54,344
You think he's allergic to Iodine?

905
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:55,649
No, again.

906
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:56,920
Just don't interrupt me.

907
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,698
Thirteen was right.

908
00:37:59,698 --> 00:38:01,404
This is a thyroid issue.

909
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:06,440
He has Plummer's disease.

910
00:38:09,962 --> 00:38:12,371
He has a nodule in his thyroid.

911
00:38:12,371 --> 00:38:15,449
It produces excess hormone.

912
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:17,590
Not enough to test abnormal,

913
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,100
just more than his brain is used to.

914
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,944
Just enough to make him
irrationally generous,

915
00:38:22,944 --> 00:38:25,068
make him vulnerable to overheating.

916
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:27,243
Then you pumped his body full of Iodine

917
00:38:27,243 --> 00:38:28,967
and kicked him into thyrotoxicosis.

918
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:30,706
I said don't interrupt.

919
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:32,346
But, yes, you're right.

920
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:35,157
Take out the nodule, he'll be fine.

921
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:50,858
Two days, one surgery.

922
00:38:51,151 --> 00:38:53,724
I now accept, that your all better.

923
00:38:54,908 --> 00:38:55,944
Where's my money?

924
00:38:55,944 --> 00:38:57,684
You made me sick.

925
00:38:57,684 --> 00:38:59,792
You were already sick.

926
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:03,690
I just made you much, much worse.

927
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,945
Seriously...the money.

928
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:11,637
You're not giving it to me, are you?

929
00:39:11,637 --> 00:39:15,184
When you're facing death...

930
00:39:15,184 --> 00:39:16,991
some things come into focus.

931
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:19,835
<i>My wife.</i>

932
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:21,742
You love your family. You want them back.

933
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:26,393
Your altruism was always a symptom.

934
00:39:26,393 --> 00:39:29,002
No, it wasn't. I'm still gonna--

935
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:31,713
Keep less? How much less?

936
00:39:31,713 --> 00:39:33,586
Just enough to spoil your kids?

937
00:39:33,586 --> 00:39:34,757
No.

938
00:39:34,757 --> 00:39:36,732
But they need it more than people with TB

939
00:39:36,732 --> 00:39:38,807
or children in Indonesia with no eyes?

940
00:39:38,807 --> 00:39:41,383
Diagnosticians with hearts of gold?

941
00:39:41,383 --> 00:39:43,892
I don't wanna give you money
because you're an ass.

942
00:39:46,102 --> 00:39:47,606
I was an ass last week.

943
00:39:51,187 --> 00:39:53,529
I love my family.

944
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:57,176
I want to be with them.

945
00:39:57,176 --> 00:39:58,916
That doesn't make me a bad person.

946
00:39:58,916 --> 00:39:59,668
No.

947
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:02,596
It makes you a healthy person.

948
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:15,211
My mechanic called.

949
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:17,185
He said the work's been paid for.

950
00:40:17,185 --> 00:40:19,728
You mentioned your car was in the shop.

951
00:40:19,728 --> 00:40:22,003
That's $4,500.

952
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:25,383
Smile and say thank you.

953
00:40:25,383 --> 00:40:27,022
Or I get you G.P.S.

954
00:40:30,436 --> 00:40:31,539
You win.

955
00:40:36,325 --> 00:40:37,445
Thank you.

956
00:40:47,718 --> 00:40:49,591
Your car is getting fixed.

957
00:40:49,591 --> 00:40:51,549
You're right. She went for it.

958
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:54,828
Good work.

959
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:57,119
Need a lift tomorrow?

960
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,244
'Cause your car is still in the shop.

961
00:40:59,244 --> 00:41:01,436
I don't take charity.

962
00:41:01,436 --> 00:41:02,657
