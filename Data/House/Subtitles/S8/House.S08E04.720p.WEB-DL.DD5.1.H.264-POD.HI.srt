00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,571
if its members
have positive feelings

181
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:34,989
about that society.

182
00:07:35,073 --> 00:07:36,007
Iranian women.

183
00:07:36,074 --> 00:07:37,858
Drag Queens in Uganda.

184
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:40,661
Patriotism is nothing
but loyalty to real estate,

185
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:42,413
real estate that's been
conquered 800 times

186
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:45,750
by 800 different regimes
with 800 different cultures.

187
00:07:45,817 --> 00:07:48,536
But each time,
it's just the best.

188
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,538
I claim this burger

189
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:52,206
in the name of
Queen Isabella of Spain.

190
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:56,294
I'll go check
on the patient.

191
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:57,795
I have Hepatitis C.

192
00:08:03,468 --> 00:08:04,802
She got it from me.

193
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:17,531
Hey, how's my dad doing?

194
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:18,899
Ah, great.

195
00:08:18,984 --> 00:08:20,401
His vision's back to normal,

196
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:22,737
and if he remains asymptomatic
through the night,

197
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:24,221
we'll be able to release him
in the morning.

198
00:08:24,289 --> 00:08:26,090
Any chance that could
happen before 9:00?

199
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:28,492
Our stock dropped
a couple points today

200
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:29,577
with the news
that he's sick.

201
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:30,995
I would love for him
to get out of here

202
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:33,697
before the market opens.

203
00:08:33,749 --> 00:08:36,083
No offense, but, uh,

204
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:38,235
I think it's terrible
your dad's closing down

205
00:08:38,303 --> 00:08:41,005
all your American operations.

206
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:44,775
I don't think he's
moving the company out of greed.

207
00:08:44,843 --> 00:08:47,978
He's moving it
out of grief.

208
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:51,549
My mom, she died
four months ago.

209
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,518
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
and...

210
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:57,388
It's been hard for him--
living in their house,

211
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:58,989
driving down
the same streets.

212
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:01,075
I mean, he's constantly
reminded of her.

213
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:02,109
[Rapid beeping]

214
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:03,611
Dad?

215
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:05,446
[Overlapping chatter]

216
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,697
[Coughing and retching]

217
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:07,915
<i>I need</i>
<i>an intubation kit in here!</i>

218
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:08,899
What's going on?

219
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:14,123
Angiography showed
a hemorrhagic site

220
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:15,291
in the left lower lobe.

221
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:18,244
I think it could be
hyperviscosity syndrome.

222
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:20,947
Are you sure Foreman's
okay with this thing

223
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:22,415
in his office?

224
00:09:22,482 --> 00:09:24,534
He's never gonna know.

225
00:09:24,618 --> 00:09:26,786
He's actually in here
right now.

226
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:28,788
Blood count and protein count
are normal.

227
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:31,340
I think it could be
hyperviscosity syndrome.

228
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:33,876
Sorry, but after Park
sent out here hospital-wide

229
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:36,012
non-apology apology
this morning,

230
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:37,763
I assume that plagiarism
is the new black.

231
00:09:37,831 --> 00:09:39,549
If it makes Andrews
look sympathetic...

232
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,834
Copying him makes you
look pathetic.

233
00:09:41,885 --> 00:09:44,871
And I will pay you not to go
to anger management classes.

234
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:46,689
What about another
clotting problem?

235
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:48,674
Factor 5
Leiden deficiency.

236
00:09:48,742 --> 00:09:50,026
<i>It's possible.</i>

237
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,228
Adams is the one who needs
to deal with her anger.

238
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:53,913
Myelodysplastic syndrome.

239
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:55,114
I heard about
your conversation

240
00:09:55,182 --> 00:09:56,449
with the patient's daughter.

241
00:09:56,517 --> 00:09:57,567
You were hostile.

242
00:09:57,651 --> 00:09:59,218
Well, their company's
making a decision

243
00:09:59,286 --> 00:10:00,820
I strongly disagree with.

244
00:10:00,888 --> 00:10:02,722
Yet you were never
anything but courteous

245
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:05,074
to the racists and rapists
in prison.

246
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:06,576
Those guys made decisions
you supported?

247
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,294
Myelodysplastic syndrome.

248
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:09,829
I'm guessing it has something
to do with the funeral

249
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,597
you attended
yesterday morning.

250
00:10:11,665 --> 00:10:13,216
I was at a job interview.

251
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,967
You got to work at 9:15.

252
00:10:15,035 --> 00:10:16,702
Closest hospital with
an opening in your specialty

253
00:10:16,753 --> 00:10:18,204
is 45 minutes away.

254
00:10:18,255 --> 00:10:19,205
It's not possible.

255
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:20,539
My condolences.

256
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:21,924
I wasn't at a funeral.

257
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,929
That just leaves...

258
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:28,748
Everywhere
but a job interview.

259
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:29,982
Get out.

260
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,100
<i>Who goes there?</i>

261
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:32,318
Reveal yourself!

262
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:33,519
Now.

263
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,720
<i>Well, we would.</i>

264
00:10:34,771 --> 00:10:37,073
<i>But Orthopedics</i>

265
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:38,941
<i>in two thirds of my office,</i>

266
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:40,076
which is weird,

267
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,563
'cause you got
a large check last night.

268
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:46,499
From a corporation
that's going through

269
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,301
a very public
belt-tightening.

270
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:50,403
<i>Means this donation</i>
<i>was given under duress.</i>

271
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,121
<i>Patient didn't tell me</i>
<i>the whole story,</i>

272
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:56,626
but he did say he'd be thrilled
if we didn't cash this.

273
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:58,561
[Check tearing]

274
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:00,580
Got a policy review meeting
in here in five minutes.

275
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:01,464
Good-bye.

276
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:12,308
What are you doing?

277
00:11:12,392 --> 00:11:13,726
Holding your ass.

278
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:15,144
You really
didn't know?

279
00:11:15,229 --> 00:11:17,029
- House...
- Just trying to help you out here.

280
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:18,731
I figure for sure
he'd punch me in the face,

281
00:11:18,782 --> 00:11:20,733
thus proving
it's a natural response.

282
00:11:23,036 --> 00:11:27,073
My God, you have
super-human discipline.

283
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,824
And glutes.

284
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:30,343
Get your hands off me.

285
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:37,833
Sorry.

286
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:39,986
Go.

287
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:43,756
Why...did you do that?

288
00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:45,591
We have a bet.

289
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:47,843
But he's the chair of
the disciplinary committee.

290
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:50,730
Forget about the bet.

291
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:53,566
You two really need
to do your homework with me.

292
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:56,185
Treat the patient with
activated protein c.

293
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,469
If he has
myelodysplastic syndrome,

294
00:11:57,521 --> 00:11:58,854
he'll bleed out.

295
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:01,023
And if he has Factor 5
Leiden deficiency,

296
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:02,275
he'll throw another clot.

297
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:03,409
Exactly.

298
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:04,777
It's a conclusive test.

299
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:06,579
There's no actual risk.

300
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:08,414
As long as you're
both paying attention,

301
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:11,150
and are both good enough
to work here.

302
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:18,341
I hear one of you thinks
I'm a real bastard.

303
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:20,209
I guess
that would be me.

304
00:12:20,294 --> 00:12:21,794
Your boss uses blackmail,

305
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:24,130
and you question
my professional ethics?

306
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:27,433
Will you be instituting
worker safety regulations

307
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:28,701
in your new factories?

308
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:29,852
Oh, absolutely.

309
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:30,903
What about juice boxes
in the break room

310
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:32,471
for the children
you'll be hiring?

311
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:34,073
Charges of
child exploitation

312
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:35,308
against American companies

313
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:37,310
have been blown
way out of proportion.

314
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:40,012
My ten-year-old cousin
lives near Cebu City.

315
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,981
<i>Works at</i>
<i>an American factory.</i>

316
00:12:42,032 --> 00:12:43,682
I am so sorry.

317
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:47,019
It's the best thing
for him.

318
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,455
It sucks, but the Filipino
factories suck worse,

319
00:12:49,522 --> 00:12:51,540
and the schools would suck
if they existed.

320
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,926
So this is the family's
best hope.

321
00:12:56,246 --> 00:12:57,880
Are you okay?

322
00:12:57,964 --> 00:12:59,165
Is this supposed
to itch like this?

323
00:13:01,134 --> 00:13:04,637
[Buzzing]

324
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:05,588
Itching.

325
00:13:05,672 --> 00:13:06,722
Interesting.

326
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:07,923
Not interesting.

327
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:09,225
Already went away.

328
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:10,926
Doubly interesting.

329
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:12,261
Means we have
to explain the arrival

330
00:13:12,346 --> 00:13:14,680
and the departure.

331
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:17,383
Oh.

332
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:18,901
That's real mature, House.
What do you mean?

333
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:20,603
This is outlandishly
childish.

334
00:13:20,687 --> 00:13:21,771
I custom-built this puppy.

335
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:23,856
It's got 106 leds,

336
00:13:23,907 --> 00:13:26,442
each one sending light
to your eyes,

337
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:27,860
slightly different
wavelength.

338
00:13:27,911 --> 00:13:29,829
Turn that off.
Different wavelengths

339
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:32,114
are stimulating your
autonomic nervous system.

340
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:33,532
<i>That's what's making you</i>
<i>feel like you're on a boat</i>

342
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,457
Oh ho ho! Cool.

343
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:48,431
You think I'm not--

344
00:13:48,515 --> 00:13:50,433
you think I'm not gonna
go to Foreman with this?

345
00:13:50,517 --> 00:13:51,467
Oh, you will.

346
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:52,885
And...I'll deny it,

347
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:54,253
and he'll believe you.

348
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:56,439
But then these two
believe that the policy

349
00:13:56,523 --> 00:13:58,774
<i>of protecting American jobs</i>
<i>starts at home.</i>

350
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:01,727
So they'll never
testify against me.

351
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:02,928
<i>And you won't be able</i>
<i>to prove anything.</i>

352
00:14:05,816 --> 00:14:06,782
Now, if I punched him
in the face,

353
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:09,034
that he could prove.

354
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:10,703
<i>I remember you saying</i>
<i>something about</i>

355
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,105
<i>how loyalty to real estate</i>
<i>was stupid.</i>

356
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:17,776
This is about
reclaiming stolen property!

357
00:14:17,828 --> 00:14:19,278
Loyalty to real estate
is stupid,

358
00:14:19,329 --> 00:14:20,546
because loyalty is stupid.

359
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:22,548
First patriotism,
now loyalty.

360
00:14:22,616 --> 00:14:24,049
You hate ice cream too?

361
00:14:24,117 --> 00:14:25,785
French vanilla, yeah.

362
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:28,504
<i>To willfully identify</i>
<i>yourself as something else</i>

363
00:14:28,588 --> 00:14:30,389
is a perversion
of self-expression.

364
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:31,390
<i>I had a thought.</i>

365
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,892
<i>Other than the fact</i>

366
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,061
that loyalty is the basis
of all meaningful relationships.

367
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:37,713
<i>The daughter said</i>
<i>that her mother died</i>

368
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:39,198
<i>of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.</i>

369
00:14:39,266 --> 00:14:40,900
What if she was misdiagnosed?

370
00:14:42,936 --> 00:14:45,371
Dutch chocolate's
not bad.

371
00:14:45,439 --> 00:14:46,906
Gotta give 'em that.

372
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,474
<i>Her lymphoma could have</i>
<i>been caused by a virus,</i>

373
00:14:48,542 --> 00:14:51,277
HTLV-1, which
our patient contracted

374
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:53,045
through having sex
with his wife.

375
00:14:53,113 --> 00:14:56,031
In other words,
loyalty gave him cancer.

376
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:57,149
I like it.

377
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,701
Start him on radiation.

378
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:01,537
[Buzzing]

379
00:15:01,621 --> 00:15:03,389
Chang and Eng Bunker.

380
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:05,391
It's the most famous
conjoined twins in history.

381
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,926
2011 is the bicentennial
of their birth.

382
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:09,845
The best Halloween costumes

383
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:12,097
are always the ones
that need an explanation.

384
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:13,799
<i>What took you so long?</i>

385
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,851
I already lost
one of them.

386
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:17,186
You need help
with the lacerations?

387
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,438
No, I think
I got palliative.

388
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:20,556
Why don't you
take preventative?

389
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,441
Prevent what?
He got in a fight.

390
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:23,742
<i>Which he started.</i>

391
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,895
Which means he's both
irascible and stupid.

392
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:27,480
I told the drunk,
racist frat guy

393
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:29,231
the proper term
is "conjoined twin,"

394
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:30,199
not "Siamese."

395
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:31,650
I can't comment

396
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:33,519
on the drunk or the frat.

397
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,404
But Chang and Eng
were both, in fact,

398
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:36,789
born in Siam.

399
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:39,124
And they were,
in fact, twins.

400
00:15:39,192 --> 00:15:40,659
If your name was Richard,
it would be okay

401
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,728
for me to call you a Dick.

402
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:44,246
<i>But maybe</i>
<i>some of the tripe</i>

403
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:45,697
you learn
in anger management class

404
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:47,266
might help keep this guy
out of here

405
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:48,334
<i>the next time.</i>

406
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:51,420
Sometimes,
it's incredibly satisfying

407
00:15:51,505 --> 00:15:54,640
<i>to wind up and punch someone</i>
<i>who really deserves it.</i>

408
00:15:54,707 --> 00:15:55,808
But when you think
about the consequences--

409
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,142
Okay, let's go.

410
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,178
I thought you wanted me
to help him with his anger.

411
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:00,262
No, I got
everything in need.

412
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:01,713

[With playback]
It's incredibly satisfying

415

someone who deserves it.

416
00:16:07,387 --> 00:16:09,822
[Beep] Wonder what the committee's
gonna make of that.

417
00:16:14,144 --> 00:16:16,378
This is a waste of time.

418
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:18,547
There's no way that Robin
gave me an STD.

419
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:24,336
I know this is hard,
and I'm sorry

420

I miss my wife,

425
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,613
but it's not driving
my decision-making.

426
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,351
You were CEO since 1988.

427
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,288
You decided to move your company
right after your wife died.

428
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:45,324
<i>It stands to reason</i>
<i>that your emotions factored in.</i>

429

My wife...

430
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:51,797
is the only thing
that keeps me here.

431
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:57,653
I visit her grave
once a week.

432
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:03,008
So your daughter
was wrong.

433
00:17:03,076 --> 00:17:05,494
You just...really need

434
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:08,497
<i>a lot of money.</i>

435
00:17:08,582 --> 00:17:10,683
You ever hear
of Kongo Gumi?

436
00:17:13,353 --> 00:17:17,623
Construction company in Japan
founded in the year 578.

437
00:17:17,674 --> 00:17:20,626
Family-owned and operated.

438
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:25,898
Building Buddhist temples
for 50 generations.

439
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:30,202
We--went bankrupt
five years ago.

440
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:35,240
You have any idea how
that last CEO must have felt?

441
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:40,346
Sorry, I...have to move.

Your heart rate
is speeding up.

446
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:49,154
Do you feel any tightness
in your chest?

447
00:17:49,205 --> 00:17:51,590
Yes, I figured
it was from the radiation.

448
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,175
I think you're having
a heart attack.

449

[Knock on door]

450
00:17:57,347 --> 00:17:58,547
Come in.

451
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:02,267
Dr. Wilson...

452
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:04,002
I need your advice.

453
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:07,005
Um...I bet House $100

454
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:08,357
that I wouldn't get fired

455
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:10,859
after my
disciplinary hearing.

456
00:18:10,944 --> 00:18:12,778
Ever since then,
he's been acting like

457
00:18:12,845 --> 00:18:15,147
he's actually trying
to get me fired.

458
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:18,017
That's because he is actually
trying to get you fired.

459
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:20,019
Does he hate me?

460
00:18:20,086 --> 00:18:21,553
Not sure that's relevant
to the equation.

461
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,722
So it's really over $100?

462
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,591
Not sure the amount
is relevant.

463
00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:26,492
He's fighting for his honor.

464
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,694
He'll ruin my career.

465
00:18:28,745 --> 00:18:31,413
- Not sure that's--
- What if I bet him $200

466
00:18:31,498 --> 00:18:33,465
I will get fired.

467
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,100
He sees competing debts
with the same person

468
00:18:35,168 --> 00:18:36,935
as a disgrace to the game.

469
00:18:37,003 --> 00:18:39,238
He'll be even more
motivated to beat you.

470
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:44,927
If you were me,
what would you do?

471
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:47,880
You have to give him something

472
00:18:47,947 --> 00:18:49,615
he values more than honor.

473
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:54,486
And you should
update your resume.

474
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:04,749
<i>EKG and troponins</i>
<i>were equivocal.</i>

475
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,312
It's not even clear
if our patient

476
00:19:07,363 --> 00:19:09,164
just had a heart attack
or what it was.

477
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,700
Let's look at segmental
wall motion abnormalities.

478
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,502
Get him an echo
to confirm.

479
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:17,205
I need $200,000.

480
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,874
His company's lost
one third of its value

481
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,792
since he was admitted.

482
00:19:20,843 --> 00:19:22,661
And you want to do
some insider trading?

483
00:19:22,712 --> 00:19:24,296
I take it felonies

484
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:25,847
aren't a violation
of your parole?

485
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,049
It's not insider trading.

486
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,134
Just betting on myself
to solve the case.

487
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:31,336
Once we cure him,
share price goes up,

488
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:32,337
I pay you back.

489
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,939
No.

490
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,840
No, you don't say "no."

491
00:19:35,892 --> 00:19:38,110
You...make a counter offer.

492
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,028
I'm not
loaning my boss money.

493
00:19:40,113 --> 00:19:41,780
Fine.
I'll make you a counter.

494
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,348
$100,000.

495
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:45,867
$20,000.

496
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,185
I'll buy options
instead of shares.

497
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:48,370
More risk,
but more upside.

498
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,038
But that's as low
as I'm gonna go.

499
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,625
I could do $5,000.

500
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,243
Really? No backsies.

501
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:58,246
If...you double
your clinic hours.

502
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:00,415
Six a week.

503
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,384
I've seen how you
disrespect those patients.

504
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,386
So you want twice as many
of them disrespected?

505
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,221
Spend more hours with them,

506
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,890
you'll treat them
more humanely.

507
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,427
And this time,
a land war in Russia

508
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,546
will be a good idea.

509
00:20:14,597 --> 00:20:15,981
Deal?

510
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,883
Here's what
I'm thinking.

511
00:20:18,935 --> 00:20:20,268
You went to
a parole hearing,

512
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,071
where one of your old patients
was denied.

513
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,107
Hence the attire,
hence the tardiness.

514
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,859
And, most important,
hence the anger.

515
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,828
You think you can
restore the cosmic balance

516
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,413
by doing extra good here.

517
00:20:31,447 --> 00:20:33,749
More annoyingly,
by having me do it

518
00:20:36,786 --> 00:20:38,403
and deal!

519
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,722
[Buzzing]

520
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:02,978
[Buzzing stops]

521
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:06,281
Of course, you know...
this means war.

522
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:08,283
Oh, I know.

523
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,035
I mean, you'll escalate,

524
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,036
and then I'll retaliate,

525
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,320
and the cycle will continue

526
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,072
until we've both
gone too far,

527
00:21:14,123 --> 00:21:17,042
at which point, I'll...
maybe get suspended

528
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,379
and...you'll go
back to prison.

529
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,384
Happy pranking.

00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:41,233
check the electrical.

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,819
EP study.

537
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,804
Nice idea.

538
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:48,407
Even has a metaphor
in it.

539
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,775
Not worth more
than my honor.

540
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:51,243
But delightful,
all the same.

00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,946
<i>I'm not going to lose.</i>

542
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,848
My college roommate
is the editor

543
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,617
of <i>the Yale Law Review.</i>

544
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,019
She's writing
my opening statement.

545
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,121
You will be eloquent
in your loss.

546
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:05,257
This case boils down
to he said, she said.

547
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,342
He said, "I've been working
at this hospital for 15 years

548
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,344
and I'm taking
self-improvement classes."

549
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:11,546
She said, "I've been
a fellow for two months,

550
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:12,998
and I'm kind of weird."

551
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:14,433
No, he said,
"I'm a drunk idiot

552
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,967
"who thinks he can
grab girls' behinds

553
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:17,369
without ramifications."

554
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:18,804
Wait, he was drunk?

555
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,672
- In the hospital?
- <i>I already told Foreman</i>

556
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,873
he'd been drinking
that night.

557
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,992
Andrews was taking
sexual harassment classes,

558
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,479
not AA.

559
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:30,649
That means he didn't
get in trouble for drinking.

560
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,484
Which means that Foreman
signed off on it,

561
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:36,088
which means that he set
all the wheels in motion.

562
00:22:38,257 --> 00:22:40,425
Forget that.
Wild speculation.

563
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:42,210
Go do the EP study.

564
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:50,302
You already knew Andrews
was drinking that night,

565
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,871
didn't you?

566
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:54,239
Yes.

567
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:57,142
I think you should
cancel my hearing.

568
00:22:59,228 --> 00:23:02,013
I hope this isn't going
where I assume it's going.

569
00:23:02,064 --> 00:23:03,148
You're the one
who brought Andrews in.

570
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,717
You set the wheels
in motion.

571
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,941
We had a patient
who was going to die

572
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:15,560
without
an AVM embolization.

573
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:19,231
Andrews...was the only
neurologist I could reach.

574
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,082
He told me had
a few glasses of wine,

575
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,284
and that he shouldn't do it,

576
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,736
but he also said
that you were good.

577
00:23:24,787 --> 00:23:28,106
You were ready to do one,
as long as you were supervised.

578
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:29,708
So we agreed
that he would come in,

579
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,610
but wouldn't
touch the patient.

580
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,962
I can understand
the rationalization.

581
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,246
We'll see
if the Board agrees

582
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:38,316
when I tell them
the whole story at my hearing

583

584
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:42,254
I already did.

585
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,090
I had a closed session
hearing last week.

586
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:47,091
The Board decided to dock me
two weeks pay.

587
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,780
Oh.

It wouldn't be a gift.

My option to sell

00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:51,170
So they thought the patient
would be better by now.

Instead, I am
going to lose $20,000.

tomorrow you'll owe
just shy of $1 million.

621
00:25:16,012 --> 00:25:17,446
It's your own fault.

622
00:25:17,513 --> 00:25:18,864

You refuse

his heart and his brain.

Well, if he has
normal pressure hydrocephalus,

686
00:27:36,486 --> 00:27:38,203
a tilt table test
could put him in a coma.

00:28:45,054 --> 00:28:48,056
What would House want
with a skin resurfacing laser?

713
00:28:48,107 --> 00:28:49,741
I have no idea.
Have you seen it?

714
00:28:49,826 --> 00:28:52,394
<i>My feet feel hot.</i>

715
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:54,229
That's completely normal.

716
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,282
No, but House has been
talking about

717
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,268
how badly he wants
to remove those prison tats.

718
00:28:59,335 --> 00:29:00,869
It's a very expensive
machine,

719
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:02,371
and I'd like it back.

720
00:29:02,422 --> 00:29:03,905
Please tell me
if you hear anything.

721
00:29:06,543 --> 00:29:08,010
How expensive?

722
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:09,611
$200,000.

723
00:29:12,081 --> 00:29:13,098
He took it.

724
00:29:13,183 --> 00:29:14,917
I have no idea.

725
00:29:14,984 --> 00:29:16,885
Park's hearing's
about to start.

726
00:29:16,936 --> 00:29:18,453
You're covering for him.

727
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:20,422
<i>I did the same thing</i>
<i>many times.</i>

728
00:29:20,473 --> 00:29:22,357
My advice to you--
figure out what line

729
00:29:22,425 --> 00:29:23,959
you aren't willing
to cross for him.

730
00:29:24,027 --> 00:29:27,763
Because, eventually,
he'll ask you to cross it.

731
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,997
[Door shuts]

732
00:29:33,903 --> 00:29:35,337

<i>Mr. Barton?</i>

734
00:29:42,662 --> 00:29:45,013
Can you hear me,
Mr. Barton?

735
00:29:47,634 --> 00:29:49,334
[Gasps]
Oh, no.

736
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,307
We have convened
the disciplinary committee

737
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,276
to decide the appropriate
action that should be taken

738
00:29:57,327 --> 00:29:59,746
against Dr. Chi Park
as a result of her actions

739
00:29:59,813 --> 00:30:02,749
on October 7th of this year.

740
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:05,001
Dr. Park, do you have
an opening statement.

741
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:07,036
Dr. Foreman,
members of the committee,

742
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:08,704
thank you for giving me
this opportunity

743
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:10,590
to speak to you today, I...

744
00:30:12,176 --> 00:30:13,259
Good news.

745
00:30:13,326 --> 00:30:14,377
<i>You can cancel</i>
<i>the hearing.</i>

746
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:15,494
'Cause I'm
firing her myself.

747
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:16,829
She's not yours to fire.

748
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,848
You guys better
fire her for insubordination,

749
00:30:18,932 --> 00:30:20,767
'cause she went rogue,
and my patient is now in a coma.

750
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:21,717
I'm the one
who did the test.

751
00:30:21,802 --> 00:30:23,052
<i>No, it was my idea!</i>

752
00:30:23,137 --> 00:30:24,170
Seriously, House?

753
00:30:24,221 --> 00:30:25,188
At least
I'm smart enough

754
00:30:25,272 --> 00:30:26,522
to know what
I don't know.

755
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:28,057
<i>She went out of her way</i>
<i>to defy me!</i>

756
00:30:28,142 --> 00:30:30,726
<i>She needs--damn it,</i>
<i>you should just fire her!</i>

757
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:33,362
My apologies.

758
00:30:33,447 --> 00:30:36,115
<i>My apologies, Dr. Park.</i>

759
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:37,400
Dr. House's comments

760
00:30:37,484 --> 00:30:39,068
<i>will, of course,</i>
<i>have no bearing</i>

761
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:40,536
on this hearing.

762
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:42,905
Please continue.

763
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,694
I, uh...

764
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:50,079
I can't believe
you did that.

765
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:52,298
Right back at ya.

766
00:30:52,365 --> 00:30:55,001
Our patient's dying.
We need theories.

767
00:30:55,052 --> 00:30:57,053
It's gotta be normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

768
00:30:57,137 --> 00:30:58,921
Andrews predicted the coma.

769
00:30:59,006 --> 00:31:01,340
Yeah, but even a broken
doctor's right twice a day.

770
00:31:01,391 --> 00:31:03,759
Patient wasn't wet,
wobbly, or wacky.

771
00:31:03,844 --> 00:31:06,012
Coma had to be
a lucky guess.

772
00:31:06,063 --> 00:31:08,380
If you didn't think
he was right,

773
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:10,483
then why did you want us
to collect his spinal fluid?

774
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:13,152
I didn't. I wanted you
to do a tilt table test.

775
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,937
You have a wonderful way
of communicating.

776
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:16,906
I knew Park wanted
to do a tilt table.

777
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,390
She listens to me,
I waste an hour.

778
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:19,992
If she defies me...

779
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,395
Then I get the test I want
and my 100 bucks.

780
00:31:23,447 --> 00:31:24,897
Up high.

781
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:26,732
You're an ass.

782
00:31:26,783 --> 00:31:28,701
You're angry.

783
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:30,786
Yes!
Now I'm angry.

784
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:33,339
Let's run the test for normal
pressure hydrocephalus.

785
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:34,924
No.

786
00:31:35,008 --> 00:31:37,093
What else would
explain our symptoms

787
00:31:37,177 --> 00:31:41,380
and make our patient go
into a coma during that test?

788
00:31:41,431 --> 00:31:43,082
How 'bout
hepatic encephalopathy?

789
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:44,467
No, we already tested
his liver enzymes.

790
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:45,635
They're normal.

791
00:31:45,719 --> 00:31:47,136
Or his liver's so far gone

792
00:31:47,221 --> 00:31:49,055
it can't even
produce enzymes.

793
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:50,439
That's desperate.

794
00:31:50,524 --> 00:31:52,441
Fits the symptoms.

795
00:31:52,526 --> 00:31:54,494
And Andrews is a hack.

796
00:31:54,561 --> 00:31:56,362
Go biopsy to confirm.

797
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:58,030
Unless you want
your own hearing.

798
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:01,484
You'd have
to hire me first.

that my dad's in a coma...

889
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:43,486
So I'm gonna be
completely cured.

890
00:36:43,554 --> 00:36:45,621
It's not all about you.

891
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:47,456
<i>Your stock price</i>

892
00:36:47,507 --> 00:36:48,841
will be completely cured.

893
00:36:48,926 --> 00:36:51,210
Once you sign this.

894
00:36:51,295 --> 00:36:52,795
It's a press release.

895
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:55,214
It says that you're healthy,
you're going back to work,

896
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:56,498
and you're
signing the lease

897
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,833
that officially
moves the company to China.

898
00:36:57,884 --> 00:36:59,168
<i>He just woke up.</i>

899
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,003
Dad, you don't have
to deal with this right now.

900
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:02,438
Ah, mm, yeah, actually...

901
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:03,889
He does.

902
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,975
<i>'Cause the market</i>
<i>opens at 9:00 a.m.</i>

903
00:37:06,026 --> 00:37:08,778
And this means
a lot to me.

904
00:37:08,845 --> 00:37:10,179
You may remember me

905
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,698
from the time
I saved your life.

906
00:37:15,852 --> 00:37:17,787
If you move it,
it'll be without me.

907
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:25,294
I know you object.

908
00:37:25,362 --> 00:37:26,295
I know you disagree with--

909
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:28,097
Dad...

910
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:29,966
I can't do it.

911
00:37:33,937 --> 00:37:35,254
If this is really
about family,

912
00:37:35,339 --> 00:37:36,606
you will not do this.

913
00:38:20,267 --> 00:38:22,051
[Indistinct chatter]

914
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:27,556
Morning.

915
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,528
Got lucky this time.

916
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:33,779
No, you didn't.

917
00:38:33,864 --> 00:38:35,531
I made this bet
so you'd stop

918
00:38:35,598 --> 00:38:36,866
actively trying
to fire Park

919
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:38,267
so you'd be neutral.

920
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:40,736
You went out of your way
to help her.

921
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:41,987
She obviously
earned your respect,

922
00:38:42,072 --> 00:38:43,406
passed
whatever test you--

923
00:38:43,457 --> 00:38:44,707
I sabotaged her hearing.

924
00:38:44,774 --> 00:38:46,575
You do read
the school paper, don't you?

925
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:47,710
[Chuckles]

926
00:38:47,777 --> 00:38:49,161
If you had sabotaged
her hearing,

927
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:50,496
she would have gotten more
than a slap on the wrist.

928
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,798
What you actually did
was make her emotional

929
00:38:52,883 --> 00:38:54,616
and make the board members
see her as a victim.

930
00:38:54,668 --> 00:38:56,152
'Cause the panel
feels badly

931
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:58,754
for incompetent doctors
who nearly kill people.

932
00:38:58,805 --> 00:39:00,456
You know that everyone
on that panel hates you.

933
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,591
You know the minute
you recommend firing anyone,

934
00:39:02,642 --> 00:39:05,461
they start discussing
how big a bonus to give them.

935
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:07,179
That's just hurtful.

936
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,849
The fact is,
winning $100 from you

937
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:10,933
gives me more pleasure

938
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:13,853
than winning $100 from her.

939
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,804
Here's your five grand.

940
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:19,141
What five grand?

941
00:39:21,811 --> 00:39:23,162
Just take it.
Trust me.

942
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:31,954
Found her sleeping
in the park.

943
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:34,656
Said she ran away because
her daddy didn't love her.

944
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,992
And that is exactly
what happened...

945
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:38,794
as far as you can prove.

946
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:40,329
Congratulations.

947
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,164
You're not going
to jail...Today.

948
00:39:42,215 --> 00:39:43,999
But you do know

949
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:45,434
I just can't let this slide.

950
00:39:45,502 --> 00:39:47,803
You need to keep up
your rep.

951
00:39:47,854 --> 00:39:49,188
Fine. Clinic hours.

952
00:39:49,272 --> 00:39:50,272
I'll double them.

953
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,675
Okay.
12 hours a week.

954
00:39:52,743 --> 00:39:54,310
No...

955
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:56,312
Three times two
equals six.

956
00:39:56,379 --> 00:39:59,198
And 3 times 2
times 2 is 12.

957
00:39:59,282 --> 00:40:02,251
I know about your deal
with Adams.

958
00:40:06,957 --> 00:40:09,408
Call Chase and Taub.

959
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:11,210
Get 'em in here.

960
00:40:11,294 --> 00:40:12,861
The boys are back.

961
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,217
This check
is for significantly more

962
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:19,235
than what I told you
it would take

963
00:40:19,302 --> 00:40:20,219
to fund the department.

964
00:40:20,303 --> 00:40:21,637
I know.

965
00:40:31,714 --> 00:40:33,115
You paged me?

966
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:52,901
Congratulations.

967
00:40:58,408 --> 00:41:01,910
You caught your boyfriend
cheating that morning.

968
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:03,462
You had a big fight.

969
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:05,297
That's why you were late.

970
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:10,186
You re-pitched an S.T.D.

971
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:12,421
You haven't gotten
two consecutive minutes

972
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:13,856
without using
the word "loyalty,"

973
00:41:13,923 --> 00:41:16,725
which explains the anger
and the low self-esteem,

974
00:41:16,776 --> 00:41:18,444
and the desire
to feel pretty...

975
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:20,779
After having been rejected
explains the clothes.

976
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:28,770
It wasn't my boyfriend.

977
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:31,040
It was my husband.

978
00:41:31,107 --> 00:41:35,044
I was at my lawyer's office
signing the divorce papers.

979
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:36,228
Wow.

980
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:40,782
I missed the fact
that you were married.

981
00:41:40,834 --> 00:41:42,918
We've been separated
for almost a year.

982
00:41:44,754 --> 00:41:47,139
So...old news?

983
00:41:47,224 --> 00:41:48,691
No anger left?

984
00:42:06,142 --> 00:42:07,910
It's all bought
and paid for.
