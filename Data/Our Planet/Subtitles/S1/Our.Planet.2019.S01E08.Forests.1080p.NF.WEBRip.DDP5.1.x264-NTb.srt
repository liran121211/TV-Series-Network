2
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,814
Just 50 years ago,

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
we finally ventured to the moon.

4
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:45,795
For the very first time,
we looked back at our own planet.

5
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:58,683
Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.

6
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,610
This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain

7
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,280
and reveal what we must preserve

8
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,910
to ensure people and nature thrive.

9
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,762
Forests.

10
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,560
Over half of all the world's trees,
evergreen and deciduous,

11
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,688
stand in these great assemblies.

12
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,994
For many of us,
they are places of mystery and darkness.

13
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:15,218
They are key to our climate,
and home to countless unique species.

14
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,143
In the past, we have destroyed them
without hesitation.

15
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:30,316
Yet, forests do have
an astonishing ability to recover.

16
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:57,051
This is the southern edge
of the boreal forest,

17
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,516
the forest that dominates the far north.

18
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:11,900
It stretches eastwards across Russia
for thousands of kilometers,

19
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,696
and now, in the middle of winter,
it's largely silent,

20
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,868
seemingly empty of animals of any kind.

21
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:31,961
But this is the home
of an animal so rare it's almost mythical.

22
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,987
A Siberian tiger.

23
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,953
There are less than 600 of them.

24
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:27,767
These are the most intimate
pictures of them in the wild yet taken.

25
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:46,244
A male Siberian tiger patrols a territory
of almost 2,000 square kilometers,

26
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,957
and it has to do so
if it is to find enough prey

27
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,961
to keep itself alive
during the long winter.

28
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:09,517
This is an impoverished land
where food of any kind is scarce.

29
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,648
A pine cone.

30
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:23,072
Pine nuts provide vital energy
during the winter months.

31
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,541
Wild boar depend on these nuts.

32
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,174
For them, it has to be grab and go,

33
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,596
for they themselves are food for a tiger.

34
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:05,406
This game of hide-and-seek
is played out over vast areas of forest,

35
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,952
as all the animals search
for the life-giving stands of pine.

36
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:24,092
Poaching has taken the Siberian tiger
to the brink of extinction,

37
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,680
but, since the 1980s,
their numbers have slowly increased.

38
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,152
These rare glimpses reveal

39
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:50,201
that their future still depends on having
vast areas of forest in which to hunt.

40
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,965
The boreal forest extends
from Russia in the east,

41
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,509
across Europe, to North America.

42
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:12,432
It contains 750 billion trees,

43
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,519
and it stores
over 40 percent of the world's carbon,

44
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:21,649
making it a vital element
in the fight against climate change.

45
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:32,201
During the winter, the days are so short
and the temperature so low,

46
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,121
that growth is at a standstill.

47
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,340
This far north,
the forest can support very few animals

48
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,885
compared to the rain forests
of the tropics.

49
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:57,185
Many are dependent on the supplement
to be found in its rivers.

50
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:14,452
In western Alaska,
both in spring and, as now, in autumn,

51
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,913
salmon, having left the ocean,

52
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,625
swim up rivers to reach
their ancestral spawning grounds.

53
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,463
Their journey from the sea into the forest
represents

54
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,675
the greatest transfer of nutrients
from one habitat to another

55
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,802
anywhere on Earth.

56
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,521
The fish are crucial seasonal food

57
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,148
for all the predators
that live in this forest.

58
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:52,573
Bald eagles live here the year round
and nest close to the river.

59
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,846
Young eagles,
still without white heads,

60
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,600
spend their first years
searching for food in the forest.

61
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,854
But, like this four-year-old female,

62
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,400
they're now big enough
to try and claim a place on the river.

63
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:37,785
At first, all she can get
are the scraps left by others.

64
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,667
And she can't get even these
without a fight.

65
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,857
She will have to
look elsewhere.

66
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,656
The boreal forest may be vast,

67
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:20,703
but the places where the salmon spawn
are known to all the predators.

68
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:31,547
As the rivers begin to freeze over,
competition becomes even more intense.

69
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:47,188
This youngster is lucky,
but her success is noticed immediately.

70
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,183
She does have one advantage.

71
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,481
Females, even when young,
are larger than the males.

72
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,734
And here, size matters.

73
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,237
As winter advances,

74
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:24,118
young and old have to meet
the challenge of the intense cold.

75
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,457
If she can survive,
she will have gained a place

76
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,878
in one of the greatest
and harshest forests on Earth.

77
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,851
A little further south

78
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,521
stand the last
of the great redwood forests.

79
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:01,739
Not so long ago, these great trees
grew throughout the Pacific Northwest.

80
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,249
Now, only five percent of them remain.

81
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,637
Here, conditions are less harsh.

82
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,933
Winds bring in warm, humid air
from the Pacific Ocean,

83
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,520
so the trees are able to grow
the year round.

84
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,193
Hidden in the vegetation
of the moist forest floor

85
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,987
is a richly populated underworld.

86
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,372
A male rough-skinned newt.

87
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,170
Every spring,
he is driven by a mysterious urge

88
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:02,007
to return to the pool
where he hatched as a tadpole.

89
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,972
And he needs to get there quickly.

90
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,520
Because there are
lots of others like him…

91
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,652
with exactly the same idea.

92
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,968
They're all searching for a female,

93
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:52,099
but trekking across hundreds of meters
of old-growth forest is not easy.

94
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,067
There is strong competition.

95
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,414
And the female is anxious to get going.

96
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,422
Once paired, he hangs on,

97
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:27,718
for she may take several hours
to discharge all her eggs.

98
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,770
Other males are only too eager
to displace him if they can.

99
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,658
Competition is so vigorous

100
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,953
that the females
in the center of these writhing balls

101
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,872
have been known to drown for lack of air.

102
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,387
But her first partner maintains his grip.

103
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,600
Within weeks, their tadpoles will hatch.

104
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:24,483
And none too soon, for the forest
is about to change dramatically.

105
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,118
By the end of the summer,
the sun has baked the forest so intensely

106
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,996
that they are as dry as tinder.

107
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,272
Strong winds drive the flames,

108
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,694
and temperatures rise
to 700 degrees Celsius.

109
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,671
Its aftermath is seemingly
total destruction.

110
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,814
The wind,
scouring the newly exposed forest floor,

111
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,358
kicks up dust devils of ash.

112
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,667
The ground appears to be devoid of life.

113
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,186
But the forest is far from dead.

114
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,073
Within only a few months,

115
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,286
flowers and tree seedlings
will rise from the soil.

116
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:37,801
Many, in fact, would not have germinated
had they not received a baptism of fire.

117
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,989
Light streaming down
through the newly opened canopy

118
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,826
provides the energy
for a surge of new growth.

119
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,218
The older, well-established redwoods
have survived,

120
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,638
protected
by their thick, fire-resistant bark.

121
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:34,775
This natural resilience is essential
to the continued health of these forests.

122
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,041
Most forests, however,
cannot recover on their own.

123
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,673
Many are helped to recover by animals.

124
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,764
The trees and their inhabitants
are interdependent.

125
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,397
And nowhere
is this dependence more apparent

126
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,108
than in India's Western Ghats.

127
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,653
This globally important habitat

128
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,699
contains a third
of all animal species found in India.

129
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,504
Lion-tailed macaques.

130
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,013
They feed on the fruits
of many kinds of tree,

131
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,683
and, in doing so,
they distribute the seeds,

132
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,269
which will emerge unscathed
with their droppings.

133
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,985
But few monkeys travel very far.

134
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,699
If plants are to distribute their seeds
across great distances,

135
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,744
they need another kind of transport.

136
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:22,923
Wings.

137
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:48,784
Great hornbills have wings
that are almost two meters across,

138
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:53,789
and they enable the birds to travel
long distances in search of food.

139
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:01,755
Hornbills feed on the fruit
of 40 or so different kinds of trees,

140
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,175
and transport
the indigestible seeds they contain

141
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,552
all over the Western Ghats.

142
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:17,396
So, it's to the trees' advantage
to attract the hornbill's attention.

143
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,289
The figs themselves,
although they taste nice,

144
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,542
are not, in fact, very nutritious,

145
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,795
so the hornbills have to eat
great quantities of them.

146
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,010
It can be tiring work.

147
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,182
But it's not a free-for-all.

148
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,733
A single fig tree in fruit
attracts great numbers of hornbills.

149
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,786
Competition between them is intense.

150
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,850
This aerial jousting between males
has never been filmed before

151
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,145
and its purpose is not really understood.

152
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,525
It may be that the birds
are simply squabbling over food,

153
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,778
but it seems rather more than that.

154
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,982
The winner is able to
demonstrate his strength and skill

155
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,859
to visiting females.

156
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,456
The males certainly seem keen
to ingratiate themselves.

157
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,844
It's particularly important for hornbills
to get the best pairing

158
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:59,015
because, once established,
the bond between male and female

159
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,309
will last a lifetime.

160
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,653
The forest also benefits
from these squabbles,

161
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,406
because even a defeated hornbill

162
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:18,660
will spread seeds over wide areas
as he searches for his next meal.

163
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,545
The relationship
between trees and animals in a forest

164
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,755
is not always so harmonious.

165
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,554
This is Africa's largest forest,
the Miombo,

166
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,432
named after one of its common trees.

167
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,520
It stretches for over a thousand miles,

168
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,982
from Angola in the west
to Mozambique in the east.

169
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,910
At the height of the dry season,

170
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,998
the Miombo attracts animals
from all across southern Africa.

171
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:22,307
Elephants prefer grass
if they can get it. It's very nutritious.

172
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,687
In its absence,

173
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:32,108
they browse on the abundant leaves
and branches of the Miombo.

174
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,494
But they're not the only
hungry ones here.

175
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,417
These mopane worms

176
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,295
are not worms, of course,
but caterpillars.

177
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,969
They hatch simultaneously in huge numbers.

178
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,269
And just as the forest
is putting out new leaves,

179
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,813
they begin their attack.

180
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,121
They feed so voraciously

181
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:31,376
that in just six weeks
they increase their size 40 times.

182
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:40,051
By the time they're fully developed,
this million-strong army

183
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,596
will have stripped the entire forest
of its foliage.

184
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,731
But the Miombo bounces back.

185
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,401
With the caterpillars gone,

186
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,946
the trees produce
a second growth of leaves.

187
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,831
This fresh feast then attracts elephants.

188
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,380
They are less fussy than the caterpillars.

189
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,468
They will eat every part of the tree.

190
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:28,933
And a hungry elephant can munch through
200 kilos of vegetation in a day.

191
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,736
Yet, even this destruction
has its benefits.

192
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:46,493
It shapes the forest in a way that helps
one of Africa's most endangered animals.

193
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,581
Hunting dogs.

194
00:29:56,085 --> 00:30:00,131
They're seen most frequently,
and most easily, on grasslands.

195
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,844
But, in fact, these open forests
are their preferred habitat.

196
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,478
Browsing elephants
open up a forest,

197
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,106
and that attracts the animals
on which the dogs prey.

198
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:03,319
For the dogs, the Miombo forest
is perfect hunting country.

199
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:11,578
And it's also an excellent place
in which to bring up pups.

200
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,716
The pups greet the adults
returning from a hunt

201
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,217
with great excitement.

202
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,309
Food.

203
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,657
The first three months of the pups' lives
are spent sheltering underground.

204
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,332
Now, they are confident enough

205
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,834
to stay out in the open
for much of the time.

206
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,131
And then, like all puppies, they have fun.

207
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,359
Playing is important for the youngsters,

208
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:28,363
for as they do so,
they establish the social bonds

209
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,908
that they will need when they start
to hunt together as a team.

210
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,923
The Miombo has always been
important for hunting dogs,

211
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,594
both as a place to find prey
and as a refuge.

212
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,476
Never has it been more crucial

213
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:02,647
for the survival
of this endangered species than now.

214
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,697
But they will only survive
if other creatures are here

215
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,741
to create the kind of habitat they need.

216
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,835
Madagascar has a forest

217
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,839
dominated uniquely
by one of the oddest of trees.

218
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,800
Baobabs.

219
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,643
The island has been isolated
for over 80 million years.

220
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:45,356
During that immensity of time,
its animals and plants

221
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,652
have evolved into forms
quite different from any elsewhere.

222
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:58,161
This makes them one of
the most precious forests on our planet.

223
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:13,301
This is not a monkey,
but a distant relative, a lemur,

224
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,888
and there are
at least 40 different kinds of lemurs,

225
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,975
all unique to Madagascar
and all endangered.

226
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,396
Lemurs are crucial
to the forest.

227
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,234
Without them,
some species of tree cannot survive.

228
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:40,286
The forest even has
its own specialized lemur hunter.

229
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,298
It's Madagascar's top predator,

230
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,427
and its presence is cause for alarm.

231
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,851
It can grow
to a length of one and a half meters,

232
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,563
and it's very seldom seen in the wild.

233
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,774
It's a fossa.

234
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,203
For most of the year, fossas are solitary,

235
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:27,125
but in the breeding season, they assemble
in a way that is all their own.

236
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:35,216
Each mature female takes up residence
in a special mating tree.

237
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,442
Half a dozen or so male fossas
have gathered in the forest below it,

238
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,781
but she is clearly occupied.

239
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,495
So, one of the males leaves his scent.

240
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,792
A visiting card,
just to show that he called.

241
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:28,269
He will just have to wait around
and see whether she takes any notice.

242
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:37,153
Her present engagement can last all night.

243
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,829
With its top predators distracted,
the rest of the forest animals

244
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,791
can go about their normal nightly business
undisturbed.

245
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,758
These are immature leaf bugs,
a species found only here in Madagascar.

246
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,764
Why they have this extraordinary shape,
no one knows.

247
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,978
They feed on tree sap,

248
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:15,191
absorbing the part they need
and excreting the rest as a sweet liquid

249
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:19,570
sometimes known, perhaps flatteringly,
as honeydew.

250
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:31,707
And honeydew, in turn, provides food
for a particular species of small lemur.

251
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,390
The gray mouse lemur
is only 15 centimeters long,

252
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,476
one of the smallest primates in the world.

253
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,943
It's very active
and needs an energy-packed food.

254
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,739
And while the sugar drops
are clearly delicious,

255
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,700
they're not very sustaining.

256
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,833
So, she's not going to let
a single drop go to waste.

257
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:42,361
The male fossas below
are still awaiting their turn.

258
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,783
So, having eaten
as much as she can,

259
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,203
she retreats
to the safety of her nest hole

260
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,748
to sleep during the daylight hours.

261
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,357
Things are not looking so satisfactory
on the ground

262
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,359
around the fossas' mating tree.

263
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,784
The pair above
are clearly still engaged.

264
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:38,417
He will either have to find
another mating tree or be very patient.

265
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,803
But he may well fail altogether.

266
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:56,435
A third of Madagascar's fossas
have disappeared in the last 20 years,

267
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,982
a result of the continued destruction
of their forests by people.

268
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,239
Since these pictures were recorded,

269
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,700
this forest,
and the unique life it once contained,

270
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,203
have disappeared altogether.

271
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:24,296
Only three percent
of Madagascar's dry forest remains.

272
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,181
Worldwide, we have now destroyed

273
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:38,144
over half of the forests
that once flourished on our planet.

274
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,733
Not only are we losing the animals
that once lived in them,

275
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:49,029
we are also changing the climate
of the entire globe.

276
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,004
But our planet's forests,
if given the chance,

277
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,965
are almost unbelievably resilient.

278
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,724
Perhaps the best proof we have
of their ability to recover

279
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:21,020
can be seen on the site
of one of our greatest disasters.

280
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,403
Chernobyl.

281
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:42,708
In 1986, one of the four reactors
at the Chernobyl nuclear plant exploded.

282
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:49,215
It turned this utopian vision
of the future into a ghost town.

283
00:41:55,721 --> 00:42:00,100
Over 100,000 people
were immediately evacuated,

284
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,477
never to return.

285
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:14,657
The fallout zone was declared
uninhabitable for the next 20,000 years.

286
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:29,755
Yet despite the radiation,
there has been a remarkable recovery.

287
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,576
Within only a decade,

288
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,538
vegetation began to germinate
in the ruined city.

289
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:14,800
And as the forest reestablished itself,
animals began to appear.

290
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,787
At first it was thought
that these were rare visitors,

291
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,545
but it soon became clear
that the former city

292
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:56,175
was occupied by an established
and thriving wild community.

293
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,496
Within only 20 years,

294
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:28,415
science has recorded
populations of animals

295
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,585
similar to that
in the wilder parts of Europe.

296
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:40,302
Roe deer are now a common sight,
wandering through the suburbs.

297
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,522
Herds of the endangered Przewalski's horse

298
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,566
now roam freely
through the once busy city.

299
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,405
Most surprising of all perhaps,

300
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,409
the top predator of these forests
has reappeared.

301
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,246
Wolves.

302
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,752
Hunters like these would only return

303
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:18,006
if their prey and the surrounding forest
is also thriving.

304
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,136
Now, studies have shown

305
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:27,975
that there are seven times more wolves
inside the exclusion zone than outside it.

306
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,569
No unprotected human being

307
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,864
can stay here for long
without lethal risk.

308
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,160
But in driving us out,

309
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,956
the radiation has created space
for wildlife to return.

310
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:05,262
The dramatic recolonization of Chernobyl
in the space of only 30 years

311
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,767
is proof
of forests' extraordinary resilience.

312
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,073
If we choose to give forests
time and space,

313
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,534
they could reclothe the earth

314
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,663
with much of the rich and varied
communities of animals and plants

315
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,250
of which we have, so recently, robbed it.

316
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:46,136
A future with more forests
is key to the resilience of our planet.
