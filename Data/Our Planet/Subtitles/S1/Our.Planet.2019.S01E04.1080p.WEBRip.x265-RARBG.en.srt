1
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,772
<i>Just 50 years ago,</i>

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>we finally ventured to the moon.</i>

3
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,837
<i>For the very first time,
we looked back at our own planet.</i>

4
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:58,683
<i>Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.</i>

5
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,651
<i>This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain</i>

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,280
<i>and reveal what we must preserve</i>

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,785
<i>to ensure people and nature thrive.</i>

8
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:36,346
<i>Immense shoals of fish
throng our shallow seas.</i>

9
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,558
<i>These are anchovies.</i>

10
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,611
<i>Small fish, in turn, sustain bigger ones.</i>

11
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,913
<i>Hunters, such as giant trevally...</i>

12
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,463
<i>and mobula rays.</i>

13
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:20,056
<i>When hunters such as these work together,
they become extremely efficient.</i>

14
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:07,353
<i>The rich coastal seas
are the fishing grounds of our planet</i>

15
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:13,276
<i>and can provide an abundance of food
for wildlife and humanity.</i>

16
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:33,087
{\an8}<i>The seas fringing land make up
less than a tenth of the world's oceans,</i>

17
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:39,469
<i>yet, astonishingly,
90 percent of all marine creatures</i>

18
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,055
<i>live in these coastal waters.</i>

19
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:51,105
<i>This superabundance
is due to the fact that the seafloor here</i>

20
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,358
<i>is within reach of sunlight.</i>

21
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,244
<i>Everglades National Park
in southern Florida.</i>

22
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,042
<i>Fields of seagrass
carpet the shallow tropical waters.</i>

23
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,635
<i>Like savannas on land,</i>

24
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:26,015
<i>these lush marine meadows
support a great variety of animal life.</i>

25
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,486
<i>Stingrays search for prey
hiding in the seagrass.</i>

26
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,922
<i>The Everglades are also the hunting grounds
of the coasts' most ingenious fishermen.</i>

27
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,059
<i>Bottlenose dolphins.</i>

28
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:20,153
<i>They search for food using echolocation,
a type of sonar.</i>

29
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,925
<i>Ahead of them, a shoal of mullet.</i>

30
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,564
<i>These particular dolphins</i>

31
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:00,151
<i>have developed their own special way
of catching their prey.</i>

32
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,536
<i>They carefully herd the fish
into just the right place.</i>

33
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:19,754
<i>Then one dolphin stirs up a ring of mud
that encircles the shoal.</i>

34
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,221
<i>The fish panic and take to the air.</i>

35
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,978
<i>Most escape.</i>

36
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,774
<i>Catching flying fish isn't easy.</i>

37
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,451
<i>But the dolphins move on
and take another helping.</i>

38
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,273
<i>People aren't allowed to fish commercially
within the national park,</i>

39
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,527
<i>so there's plenty for the dolphins.</i>

40
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,671
<i>Only from the air can we really appreciate
the industry of these master fishermen.</i>

41
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:59,645
<i>The shallow seas are vitally important
in the fight against climate change.</i>

42
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:07,278
<i>Seagrass absorb
35 times as much carbon dioxide</i>

43
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,697
<i>as the same area of rainforest,</i>

44
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:15,578
<i>and that reduces the damage
caused by the recent warming of our seas.</i>

45
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,835
<i>Mangroves often border
the seagrass meadows.</i>

46
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,799
<i>These remarkable trees
are the only ones that can cope</i>

47
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,011
<i>with the varying saltiness
of coastal waters.</i>

48
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,853
<i>They not only protect our coasts
from the destructive forces of hurricanes</i>

49
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,733
<i>but also, like seagrass,
capture carbon dioxide.</i>

50
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:58,120
<i>Their tangled roots
create safe nurseries for young fish,</i>

51
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,873
<i>which will eventually leave the mangroves</i>

52
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,711
<i>and make their homes in the tropical seas'
most magical wonderlands,</i>

53
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,464
<i>coral reefs.</i>

54
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:18,140
<i>These reefs cover
less than one percent of the seafloor,</i>

55
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,353
<i>yet they are home
to a quarter of all marine species.</i>

56
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,573
<i>None of these creatures would be here
were it not for the coral.</i>

57
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,797
<i>Corals create the structures
that provide food and shelter,</i>

58
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,633
<i>on which the entire community depends.</i>

59
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,603
<i>Every resident has a role to play
in maintaining the health of the reef.</i>

60
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,737
<i>Unfortunately, few reefs
are as pristine as they once were,</i>

61
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,658
<i>and most are now missing</i>

62
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,078
<i>one extremely important member
of the community.</i>

63
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,665
<i>Sharks.</i>

64
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:34,216
<i>Relentless overfishing has reduced
shark populations around the world</i>

65
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,218
<i>by over 90 percent.</i>

66
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,976
<i>Today they only thrive
in anything like their former numbers</i>

67
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,479
<i>on the very remotest of reefs.</i>

68
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,321
<i>French Polynesia,
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.</i>

69
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,201
<i>Here, at least,
sharks are fully protected.</i>

70
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,086
<i>By day, gray reef sharks
hang in the current.</i>

71
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,969
<i>They let little wrasse
pick their teeth clean</i>

72
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,722
<i>in readiness for the night's hunt ahead.</i>

73
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,279
<i>These sharks prefer to hunt in darkness,</i>

74
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,909
<i>when their acute senses
give them an advantage over their prey.</i>

75
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,666
<i>Nightfall.</i>

76
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:59,051
<i>Time for small fish to take refuge
within the nooks and crannies of the reef,</i>

77
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,764
<i>beyond the reach of the gray reef sharks.</i>

78
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,491
<i>The sharks can detect
the slightest movement.</i>

79
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,847
<i>Breaking cover is dangerous.</i>

80
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,419
<i>Stay motionless
and the sharks may not detect you.</i>

81
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,779
<i>A little fish may outmaneuver
a single shark,</i>

82
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:48,202
<i>but with so many hunters
there is little chance of escape.</i>

83
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,757
<i>Sheltering within the coral branches
is usually the safest option,</i>

84
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,514
<i>but the arrival of a second hunter
changes everything.</i>

85
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,185
<i>Whitetip reef sharks.</i>

86
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,237
<i>Slender and more agile,</i>

87
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,783
<i>the whitetips can get into hiding places
other hunters can't reach.</i>

88
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,250
<i>Those that are not caught by the whitetips</i>

89
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,753
<i>are flushed out
to the waiting gray reef sharks.</i>

90
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,389
<i>With both kinds of sharks
hunting in partnership,</i>

91
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,726
<i>there is little respite,
even within the reef.</i>

92
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:18,792
<i>More and more sharks arrive,
attracted by the commotion.</i>

93
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:04,380
<i>Such numbers of sharks were once common
on reefs around the world.</i>

94
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,552
<i>And while so many predators
may seem damaging,</i>

95
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:16,225
<i>sharks, in fact, assist
in maintaining the health of the reef.</i>

96
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,773
<i>They help to keep a balance
in the fish community</i>

97
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,778
<i>by hunting the predators
that feed on small grazing fish.</i>

98
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,621
<i>The grazers, in their turn,</i>

99
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,666
<i>keep the corals
free of seaweeds and parasites</i>

100
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,335
<i>that would otherwise overgrow the reef.</i>

101
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,718
<i>A balanced community,
with sharks as top predators,</i>

102
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:56,390
<i>gives a coral reef much greater resilience
in the face of damage and disaster.</i>

103
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,857
<i>But today, even healthy coral reefs
are facing a greater threat.</i>

104
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,866
<i>With climate change, our seas are warming.</i>

105
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,623
<i>Microscopic plants
that live within the tissues of the corals</i>

106
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,419
<i>give them both their color
and most of their nourishment.</i>

107
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,510
<i>But if seas temperatures rise
by just a degree or two,</i>

108
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,030
<i>the corals expel
their plant partners.</i>

109
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:47,072
<i>So they lose their
main source of food...</i>

110
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,444
<i>and turn white.</i>

111
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,911
<i>Here, on Australia's Great Barrier Reef,
unusually warm seas</i>

112
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,331
<i>have caused many of the reefs
to bleach in this way.</i>

113
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,255
<i>It may look hauntingly beautiful,</i>

114
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,842
<i>but if temperatures remain high
for a few weeks,</i>

115
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,347
<i>the corals will starve
and eventually die.</i>

116
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,104
<i>The carbon dioxide
that causes global warming</i>

117
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,065
<i>is also making the seas more acidic.</i>

118
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,944
<i>No reefs can survive both changes.</i>

119
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,366
<i>And without living corals,</i>

120
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,078
<i>many of the reef's residents
will also perish.</i>

121
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,839
<i>During 2016 and 2017,</i>

122
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:56,260
<i>over a thousand kilometers
of the Great Barrier Reef bleached.</i>

123
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,810
<i>Six months later,</i>

124
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,688
<i>and many of the corals are dead.</i>

125
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,401
<i>The community destroyed.</i>

126
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:26,081
<i>Worldwide, half of all shallow coral reefs
have already died.</i>

127
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,590
<i>The rest could be gone
over the next few decades.</i>

128
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,103
<i>Away from the tropics,
in higher latitudes,</i>

129
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,105
<i>the seas are much cooler.</i>

130
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:57,070
<i>Storm-lashed waters bring essential
nutrients to the surface.</i>

131
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:02,117
<i>The enriched water,
combined with long summer days,</i>

132
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,871
<i>make these
the most productive seas on the planet.</i>

133
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,885
<i>Fur seals thrive
and even have time to ride the waves.</i>

134
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,790
<i>Spring off the coast of California</i>

135
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,795
<i>and fronds of golden kelp
floating on the surface</i>

136
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,256
<i>hint at the riches hidden beneath.</i>

137
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,436
<i>A magnificent submarine forest.</i>

138
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:22,489
<i>These stands of giant kelp
are as important to the oceans</i>

139
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,449
<i>as trees are to the land.</i>

140
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,541
<i>Like a rainforest,</i>

141
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:37,671
<i>the dense canopy provides food and shelter
for an abundant community.</i>

142
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,934
<i>In the cool, rich seas,
giant kelp can grow 50 meters high.</i>

143
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:59,359
<i>Air-filled floats lift the fronds
towards the sunlit surface.</i>

144
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,413
<i>Nestling in this canopy,</i>

145
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,583
<i>a sea otter.</i>

146
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,755
<i>His thick fur keeps him warm
in the chilly water.</i>

147
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,308
<i>Blowing air into it
gives him extra insulation.</i>

148
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,280
<i>Sea otters
have the densest fur of any animal,</i>

149
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,410
<i>and such a luxuriant coat
requires a great deal of attention.</i>

150
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,901
<i>They need to eat a lot to keep warm</i>

151
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,488
<i>and consume up to a quarter
of their body weight every day.</i>

152
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,705
<i>Sea urchins are a favorite food.</i>

153
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,133
<i>There's one.</i>

154
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:48,927
<i>And a second.</i>

155
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,393
<i>And then the otter is out of breath
and must return to the surface.</i>

156
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,280
<i>An urchin
looks like a rather prickly meal,</i>

157
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,367
<i>but if you can break the shell,
there's a feast inside.</i>

158
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:26,715
<i>Sea otters are crucial
to the health of the kelp forest</i>

159
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,011
<i>because they keep down
the number of sea urchins.</i>

160
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,030
<i>The urchins graze on kelp,</i>

161
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,910
<i>munching through their tough stems.</i>

162
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:07,464
<i>Left unchecked, they spread
across the seafloor like a plague.</i>

163
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:15,347
<i>Fortunately, the otters have a helper
in the fight against these spiny grazers.</i>

164
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,730
<i>Sheephead wrasse.</i>

165
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,568
<i>They have powerful teeth</i>

166
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:33,198
<i>and can make short work
of the smaller purple urchins.</i>

167
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,017
<i>The larger black urchins
are more of a challenge,</i>

168
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,146
<i>especially for smaller wrasse.</i>

169
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,529
<i>Only the very largest sheephead
can tackle them.</i>

170
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:29,129
<i>But it still has to get past
those long spines.</i>

171
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:39,097
<i>The urchin has to be flipped over
to expose its vulnerable underside.</i>

172
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,313
<i>Not easy when you have no hands.</i>

173
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,115
<i>Success at last.</i>

174
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,621
<i>And everybody benefits.</i>

175
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:20,639
<i>These fish and otters,
living within marine protected areas,</i>

176
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,183
<i>keep the kelp grazers under control.</i>

177
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:34,736
<i>But just outside these sanctuaries,
the urchins graze unchecked...</i>

178
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,909
<i>and fell the kelp forest.</i>

179
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,751
<i>All those that depend on the kelp
have disappeared.</i>

180
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:03,139
<i>In California, kelp forests
grow abundantly in protected areas</i>

181
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:08,978
<i>where the whole marine community
can live without pressure from people.</i>

182
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:25,704
<i>Here, at least, sea otters
can chill out Californian style.</i>

183
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,560
<i>Three thousand kilometers further north,
in Alaska,</i>

184
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,604
<i>spring arrives much later in the year.</i>

185
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,195
<i>After a cold, hard winter,</i>

186
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,575
<i>the first rays of the sun
trigger a great annual event.</i>

187
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:15,086
<i>Immense shoals of herring
rise up from the depths</i>

188
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,380
<i>and move into shallower waters.</i>

189
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,177
<i>They're gathering to breed.</i>

190
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,641
<i>But predators are waiting for them.</i>

191
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,612
<i>Steller's sea lions.</i>

192
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,918
<i>So intent on their mission,
the herring make easy prey.</i>

193
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:16,940
<i>Sea lions drive the fish to the surface,
within range of aerial hunters.</i>

194
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:28,535
<i>Bald eagles, normally solitary birds,
have assembled in numbers for the feast.</i>

195
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,586
<i>In places, the herrings reach shore,</i>

196
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,509
<i>and there the eagles
don't even need to take to the air.</i>

197
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,582
<i>Humpback whales.</i>

198
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,632
<i>They have come
all the way from the tropics,</i>

199
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,260
<i>hoping to get their first meal in months.</i>

200
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:51,200
<i>These whales have a remarkable way
of collecting this seasonal bounty.</i>

201
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,430
<i>They work as a team.</i>

202
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,516
<i>The lead whale dives first...</i>

203
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:21,397
<i>and blows a curtain of bubbles
to concentrate the fish.</i>

204
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,411
<i>A call synchronizes the attack.</i>

205
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,089
<i>By cooperating in this way,
each whale can eat a ton of fish a day.</i>

206
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,928
<i>Yet the herring are so abundant</i>

207
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:39,058
<i>that, in spite of the whales,
most managed to reach the shallows.</i>

208
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,354
<i>And here they spawn.</i>

209
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,282
<i>The females lay their eggs
on the seagrass.</i>

210
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:03,916
<i>The males follow,
fertilizing the eggs with clouds of sperm.</i>

211
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:16,095
<i>Once, herring thrived here in an abundance
we can barely imagine today.</i>

212
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,066
<i>They used to turn shorelines white
with spawn,</i>

213
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,987
<i>right across the North Pacific
from Japan to California.</i>

214
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,162
<i>With industrialized fishing techniques</i>

215
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,583
<i>it's all too easy
to overexploit these breeding stocks.</i>

216
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:57,470
<i>This is one of the few places
where a fishery still survives.</i>

217
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,857
<i>Pacific herring populations
are greatly reduced.</i>

218
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,443
<i>A mere fraction of what they once were.</i>

219
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,833
<i>This sorry tale of unsustainable fishing</i>

220
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:31,003
<i>has been repeated time and again
around the world.</i>

221
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:39,637
<i>Many of the world's fish stocks
are now in serious decline.</i>

222
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,475
<i>A third of them have collapsed.</i>

223
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,243
<i>In coastal seas,</i>

224
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:07,707
<i>jellyfish are taking over waters
that were once dominated by fish.</i>

225
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,762
<i>Compass jellyfish have an ethereal beauty,</i>

226
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:27,393
<i>but they provide very little sustenance
for other wildlife or us.</i>

227
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,876
<i>These immense swarms
are becoming increasingly common.</i>

228
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:57,298
<i>A worrying sign of a serious imbalance
in our shallow seas.</i>

229
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:14,148
<i>Unless we start to fish sustainably,
our seas, once so bountiful,</i>

230
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:22,073
<i>will be filled with little more
than vast swarms... of jellyfish.</i>

231
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:42,218
<i>But the future
does not have to be like this.</i>

232
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:58,359
<i>On the Pacific coast of South America,
we can see how the oceans can recover.</i>

233
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,867
<i>The Atacama, the world's driest desert.</i>

234
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:12,081
<i>Inland it's barely able
to sustain life of any kind,</i>

235
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,463
<i>and yet the coast
could not be more different.</i>

236
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:31,600
<i>For centuries, seabirds have gathered
in millions on these desert shores.</i>

237
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:41,277
<i>But 50 years ago
the great colonies disappeared</i>

238
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,322
<i>because we overfished the local waters.</i>

239
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,871
<i>Controls were introduced,
and now the fish stocks are recovering.</i>

240
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:59,128
<i>So today, three million guanay cormorants
assemble each year to raise their young.</i>

241
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,685
<i>Each morning the birds head out to sea.</i>

242
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:39,752
<i>The colonies are so vast
they take over an hour to empty.</i>

243
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,646
<i>Joining the procession, Inca terns.</i>

244
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,531
<i>Peruvian boobies.</i>

245
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,628
<i>A great caravan of hunters,
all searching for the same thing.</i>

246
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,266
<i>Anchovies.</i>

247
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,528
<i>These little fish are so abundant</i>

248
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:51,323
<i>that they support
the greatest fishery on our planet.</i>

249
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,959
<i>Astonishingly, they can account
for a tenth of all the fish</i>

250
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,087
<i>we harvest from our oceans every year.</i>

251
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,560
<i>Sea lions are first to find the shoals.</i>

252
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:44,460
<i>As fish are driven to the surface,
they come within range of pelicans.</i>

253
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,990
<i>Cormorants dive to grab their share.</i>

254
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,504
<i>Boobies strike from heights of 20 meters.</i>

255
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,103
<i>They hit the water
at a hundred kilometers an hour.</i>

256
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:29,481
<i>Today, the lives of five million
cormorants and boobies</i>

257
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,900
<i>depend on the great shoals.</i>

258
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,076
<i>Yet, if we allow the anchovies
to fully recover,</i>

259
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,914
<i>they could sustain
the 25 million seabirds they once did.</i>

260
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,256
<i>It is a vivid reminder</i>

261
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,385
<i>of the astonishing riches
our coastal seas can support.</i>

262
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,900
<i>And, when given the chance,
they can recover surprisingly quickly.</i>

263
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:21,742
<i>The islands of Raja Ampat
in Southeast Asia.</i>

264
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:28,290
<i>These seas were largely stripped
of sharks and other large fish</i>

265
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,043
<i>by years of unregulated fishing.</i>

266
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:40,094
<i>This lagoon was once occupied
by a shark fishing camp.</i>

267
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,603
<i>Now it's a nursery for baby sharks.</i>

268
00:44:56,026 --> 00:45:00,739
<i>The seas around Misool
were fully protected in 2007,</i>

269
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,992
<i>and the recovery has been miraculous.</i>

270
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:11,041
<i>Today there are 25 times more sharks
than a decade ago.</i>

271
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:20,384
<i>Turtles that used to be hunted
now peacefully graze on the seagrass.</i>

272
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,649
<i>Sharks are returning to local reefs,</i>

273
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,236
<i>helping to restore the balanced community,</i>

274
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,824
<i>giving them a greater resilience
against the effects of coral bleaching.</i>

275
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,472
<i>Ocean-going manta rays.</i>

276
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,819
<i>Seven meters from wing tip to wing tip.</i>

277
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,329
<i>These endangered giants</i>

278
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,665
<i>spend most of their lives
roaming the high seas.</i>

279
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,880
<i>But now they are returning
to this sanctuary</i>

280
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,716
<i>to seek the attention of cleaner wrasse.</i>

281
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:57,689
<i>Misool is one of the few places on Earth
where biodiversity is actually increasing.</i>

282
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,448
<i>Since protection,
there are three times more fish</i>

283
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,200
<i>than just ten years ago.</i>

284
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,341
<i>Fishermen working nearby waters
profit from the overspill.</i>

285
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,846
<i>They now catch more fish for less effort.</i>

286
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:45,237
<i>We have far too few marine sanctuaries,</i>

287
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:49,449
<i>and in many
commercial fishing is still allowed.</i>

288
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:58,250
<i>We need to turn
a third of all our coastal seas</i>

289
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,836
<i>into properly protected areas.</i>

290
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,723
<i>If we do that,
our planet's fishing grounds would recover</i>

291
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:18,604

and the rest of the natural world.</i>
