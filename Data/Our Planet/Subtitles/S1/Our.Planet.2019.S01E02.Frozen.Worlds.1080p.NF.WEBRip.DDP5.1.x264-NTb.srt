2
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,772
Just 50 years ago,

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
we finally ventured to the moon.

4
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,837
For the very first time,
we looked back at our own planet.

5
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:58,683
Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.

6
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,651
This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain,

7
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,280
and reveal what we must preserve

8
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,826
to ensure people and nature thrive.

9
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:46,564
The polar regions of our planet
may seem beyond the reach of most of us,

10
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,532
but they are not beyond our influence.

11
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:05,458
We, unintentionally,
are changing these frozen worlds,

12
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,965
and these changes
will not just affect the poles

13
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,425
but the whole planet.

14
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,081
Antarctica.

15
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:52,463
The southern end of our planet,
and the coldest place on Earth.

16
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,387
It has been frozen for 30 million years.

17
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,977
In its center, the covering of ice
is over four kilometers thick.

18
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,525
Entire mountain ranges
are buried beneath it.

19
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,032
Here, it is so cold that each winter

20
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,161
19 million square kilometers of ocean
freezes,

21
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,122
more than doubling
the size of the ice cap.

22
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,046
But when, in spring, the sea ice melts,

23
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,550
life returns once again
to the continent's shores.

24
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,478
The peninsula that stretches north
towards South America

25
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,482
is the first part of it
to be released from winter's grip.

26
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,616
As the sea ice breaks up,

27
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,328
life returns.

28
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,898
There is a greater variety
of living creatures here

29
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,818
than anywhere else in Antarctica.

30
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:58,339
Gentoo penguins
spend most of their lives at sea,

31
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,971
but now, in spring,
they have to come ashore to breed.

32
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,100
They're the fastest of all penguins
in water,

33
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:15,148
but on land,
life takes on a slower pace.

34
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,413
It's an uphill struggle
to reach their nesting grounds...

35
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,670
...but penguins never give up.

36
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,181
The paths they follow,
carved by thousands of tiny footsteps,

37
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,017
lead to Antarctica's rarest commodity.

38
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,774
Bare rock.

39
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,159
Less than one percent of Antarctica
is ice-free,

40
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,912
and these rocky patches

41
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,540
are the only places
where gentoos can lay their eggs.

42
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,131
It's been a 30-minute struggle,

43
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,931
but he's almost at the top,
where his mate is waiting for him.

44
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,991
He presents her with a stone,

45
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,663
a gift to improve the nest
and so win her favor.

46
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,715
He's back just in time.

47
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,930
There's another mouth to feed.

48
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:31,117
Gentoo penguins used to be rare
in this part of Antarctica,

49
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,247
but now, as temperatures rise,
their numbers here are increasing.

50
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,384
Sea ice may appear to be flat
and lifeless,

51
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,640
but beneath it there is another world.

52
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,901
As the ice melts,
the light filters through,

53
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:09,030
and algae, that have been trapped
within the ice all winter, flourish.

54
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,118
This upside-down world

55
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,330
is the polar equivalent
of the great grasslands.

56
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,462
The ice is the soil
upon which plant life grows,

57
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,674
and the herds of grazers soon arrive.

58
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,639
Antarctic krill.

59
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,479
Trillions of them swarm
in the waters around Antarctica.

60
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:47,568
Protected by the ice above,
they graze on algae whilst the sun shines.

61
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,953
But the good times don't last long.

62
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,501
Once all the ice has melted,
the krill lose their protection,

63
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,841
and predators appear.

64
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,480
Penguins may have lost
their ability to fly,

65
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,067
but they still form flocks,
as so many birds do.

66
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,831
The longer they dive,

67
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,750
the longer it takes them
to catch their breath.

68
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:57,013
Ruffling their feathers traps air,
which makes their bodies more streamlined.

69
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,475
One last breath...

70
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,897
and the whole group dives down together.

71
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:19,827
The gentoos follow the krill
down to depths of over 200 meters.

72
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,055
What a flock can catch in one dive,

73
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,184
a giant traps in a single mouthful.

74
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,496
Humpback whales from the tropics

75
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,249
have traveled
over 8,000 kilometers to get here.

76
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,006
This one chooses to feed alone.

77
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,730
This technique, part lunge, part pounce,

78
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,359
only works when the krill
are close to the surface.

79
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:40,533
As more humpbacks arrive,
they begin to work in teams.

80
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,254
By lunging together,

81
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:58,509
the overspill from one huge mouth
is not lost but collected by another.

82
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:44,430
Some humpbacks regularly work
in an even more coordinated way.

83
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,784
They do so
when krill has descended to some depth.

84
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,006
Once in position,
they blast air from their blowholes.

85
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,975
Working together,

86
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,395
they create a curtain of bubbles
around their prey.

87
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,867
As the spiraling net tightens,
the krill are driven closer together,

88
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,082
and then the whales lunge upwards
and collect them.

89
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,483
Almost all humpback whales
in the southern hemisphere

90
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,820
come to the Antarctic to feed on krill.

91
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:34,123
Since the ban on commercial whaling,
their numbers have recovered dramatically,

92
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,460
but their food supply is now under threat.

93
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,133
In the last 50 years,

94
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,678
with warming temperatures
and disappearing sea ice,

95
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,973
krill stocks
in this part of the Southern Ocean

96
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,058
have more than halved.

97
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:05,404
Other sea hunters come here
seeking bigger prey than krill.

98
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,125
Antarctica's top predators.

99
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,964
Orca, killer whales.

100
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:31,180
Over half of the world's orca
patrol these polar seas.

101
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:42,441
This particular pod
specializes in hunting penguins.

102
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,622
They shift into stealth mode.

103
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:09,051
Hunting without making a sound,
so that their prey won't hear them coming.

104
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,541
A penguin can outmaneuver
a single killer whale,

105
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,711
but it can seldom escape a pod.

106
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,323
This hunt may seem cruel,

107
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:19,288
but important life skills
are being passed down the generations.

108
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,729
From killer whales to krill,

109
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:49,568
all life here ultimately depends
upon Antarctica's sea ice.

110
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:13,592
The seas that surround Antarctica
are the roughest on our planet.

111
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,856
These churning waters
draw up nutrients from the deep

112
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:33,862
and create vast, rich fishing grounds
for nomads like the wandering albatross.

113
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,759
Beneath the waves,
currents are flowing away from Antarctica,

114
00:18:56,051 --> 00:19:00,347
transporting nutrients across the planet,
fertilizing the oceans

115
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,225
and helping to regulate
global temperatures.

116
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,880
The island of South Georgia.

117
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,677
It's far enough north

118
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,347
to be beyond the reach of the sea ice
even in midwinter,

119
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,101
and many animals live here
the year round.

120
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:09,833
This wandering albatross chick
has been sitting on its nest all winter,

121
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:15,380
and is entirely dependent
on its parents returning with food.

122
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,346
It may have to wait a few days
between meals, or even a couple of weeks,

123
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,266
but at least
it's not the only one who's waiting.

124
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,566
Albatross chicks need to spend
a whole year growing

125
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,277
before they're ready
to take their first flight.

126
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:50,332
And then they spend several years at sea
before they return to land.

127
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,643
Coming in to land
on three-meter wings takes some practice.

128
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,274
Albatross don't have reverse thrusters.

129
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,588
The chick
is this female's first.

130
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:47,431
She's been raising it for six months,
and has another six to go.

131
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,354
Her chick is smaller than it should be,

132
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,317
a sign that her mate
has not been returning with food.

133
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,196
He may well have been
one of the many that die,

134
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,158
entangled on longline fishing lines.

135
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:16,501
South Georgia is an ideal place
for wanderers to raise their young,

136
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,131
but now fewer adults
are returning here to nest,

137
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,883
and in recent years,

138
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:27,054
the breeding population
has declined by 40 percent.

139
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:38,815
For now, waiting on its nest,
the chick is safe.

140
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,652
There are no land predators here.

141
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,204
But the same cannot be said
for South Georgia's seas.

142
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,669
Giant kelp flourishes
in these ice-free waters.

143
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,471
The perfect place for an ambush.

144
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:22,776
Leopard seals overwinter here
to escape Antarctica's frozen ocean.

145
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,989
They should have returned south by now,

146
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,536
but this year they've stayed longer.

147
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,129
And they've delayed their departure
for good reason.

148
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,431
There are king penguins here.

149
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,147
Each is a substantial meal,

150
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,816
if you can catch it.

151
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,742
Returning to feed their chicks,

152
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,204
the kings have no choice
but to run the gauntlet.

153
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,423
Kings rarely porpoise like this.

154
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,804
It uses more energy,
but it's faster than traveling underwater.

155
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:19,142
It's hard to select a moving target
in a panicking crowd,

156
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,443
but if there are stragglers,
the odds change.

157
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,830
Razor-sharp teeth versus a stabbing beak.

158
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,655
It's stalemate.

159
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,659
Both are exhausted after the chase.

160
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,590
The hunter decides that the meal
is not worth the fight.

161
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,561
For the penguin,
it was too close for comfort,

162
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:49,357
but that was just the first hurdle
in getting back to feed its chick.

163
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,365
It isn't going to be
a walk in the park.

164
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,772
Luckily, penguin is not on their menu.

165
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,782
Still, it's best
to let sleeping giants lie.

166
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,757
Elephant seal females
don't take kindly

167
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,801
to being disturbed from their slumber,

168
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:03,306
but it's the four-tonne males
you need to look out for.

169
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,320
They are fighting
for access to the females.

170
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:30,709
Getting bulldozed under angry blubber
is to be avoided at all costs.

171
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,678
An escape route.

172
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,144
Time to run for it.

173
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,133
At last, he's reached the nursery.
Now comes his final challenge.

174
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,836
Finding his chick
in the crowd of half a million.

175
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,383
He calls...

176
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,729
...and listens
for a recognizable reply.

177
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,365
His chick could be
another mile or two away,

178
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,367
at the back of the colony.

179
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,624
But that's the trouble with chicks.

180
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,918
They're never where you left them.

181
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,547
Astonishingly, in all this racket,

182
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:03,551
a parent and its chick
can recognize each other's calls.

183
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:17,065
The things parents go through
to deliver a meal.

184
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,694
If only they knew.

185
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,079
For such a small island,

186
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,166
South Georgia supports
an extraordinary quantity of life.

187
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,174
All these creatures
ultimately depend on the krill

188
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,845
that develops under the sea ice
around the Antarctic peninsula.

189
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,391
With sea ice disappearing,

190
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,144
so South Georgia's future
is far from certain.

191
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,705
At the other end of the planet,
in the north,

192
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:18,877
the effects of climate change
are being felt even more intensely.

193
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,090
The Arctic is not a continent
surrounded by sea

194
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,261
but a frozen ocean ringed by land.

195
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:37,228
Here, in spring, the sea ice
is still at its maximum extent.

196
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:48,948
It's a vast, firm hunting ground
for the planet's largest land carnivore.

197
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,088
A male polar bear
in search of his next meal

198
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:08,551
on the frozen fjords of Svalbard
in the high Arctic.

199
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,893
He's looking for seals,
which make up the bulk of his diet.

200
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:28,488
He must eat two-thirds
of the food he needs for the whole year

201
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,117
before the ice melts
and his hunting platform disappears.

202
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:11,739
The ringed seal mother had no choice
but to leave her pup alone on the surface.

203
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,879
In the past, she would have built a den
inside a ridge on the ice,

204
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:32,427
but now the sea freezes so late
that the ice is flat,

205
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,389
and she had to leave her pup
out in the open.

206
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:51,237
These changes in the ice
may benefit the bears for now,

207
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,448
but in the long term,

208
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,909
a crash in their most important prey
will follow.

209
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,626
This new, flatter ice
makes life difficult for the bears, too.

210
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:10,423
There's nowhere for them to hide
in order to creep up on a seal.

211
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:20,141
And for a mother with a young cub in tow,
being stealthy isn't easy.

212
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,535
The cub doesn't yet appreciate
the need for care

213
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,206
when sneaking up on a seal.

214
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,127
With fewer seals hiding in dens,

215
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,756
learning this pounding technique,
once so useful,

216
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,425
is now almost pointless.

217
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:10,858
Still, at least he's discovered
what a seal hole looks like..

218
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,916
His mother knows that overcast conditions
are good for hunting,

219
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,837
and he knows when she's serious.

220
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,223
Adult seals make a much better meal.

221
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,238
Her cub carefully treads in her footsteps,

222
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,285
and takes care not to break her outline.

223
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,791
Neither must put a foot wrong.

224
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,176
They must move as one.

225
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,538
Most seal hunts end in failure.

226
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,215
The bears must keep searching.

227
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,554
Her cub wanders off,

228
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,850
and gets another chance.

229
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,447
A seal pup alone on the ice.

230
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:36,754
Now it's not stealth
that is needed, but confidence.

231
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,886
There's nothing the mother can do,

232
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:50,559
except hope that the pup makes it
back to her hole in time.

233
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,987
The inexperienced young hunter
hesitates.

234
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,873
Its mother knows better.

235
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,941
Safe under the ice.

236
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:50,536
Polar bears are adaptable predators,
but they rely on sea ice.

237
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:56,125
If that disappears, so will the bears.

238
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,768
Summer at the ice edge
in the Canadian Arctic,

239
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,189
and the annual retreat of sea ice
is well underway.

240
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,701
As it melts, nomads arrive.

241
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:54,433
Narwhal, the origin of the unicorn legend.

242
00:39:55,267 --> 00:40:01,190
Their three-meter tusk is, in fact,
no more than an overgrown canine tooth,

243
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:06,362
but its exact function,
like so much about narwhals,

244
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,948
is still, in part, a mystery.

245
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:18,374
Each summer, narwhals travel
to the same part of the Arctic,

246
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:23,129
and patiently wait at the ice edge
for a crack to open up.

247
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:30,136
A lead in the ice,
wide enough for them to swim along.

248
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,568
Eventually, a crack appears.

249
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,906
Their passage to sheltered, shallow bays.

250
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:16,849
Narwhals are extremely timid
and rarely filmed underwater.

251
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:49,340
These ice whales eagerly travel
down the leads as soon as they open

252
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,718
because they're safer from predators
protected by the ice.

253
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,439
The leads may also give them access
to new feeding grounds.

254
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,579
Sea ice is not just crucial

255
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,707
to the lives of those creatures
that live around the poles.

256
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:30,381
It plays a vital role in determining
the climate of the whole planet.

257
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,136
A white surface keeps the earth cool

258
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,307
by reflecting most of the sun's energy
back into space.

259
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,903
A dark surface does the opposite,

260
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,824
absorbing over 90 percent
of the sun's energy

261
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,826
and so warming the earth.

262
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,707
As the sea ice shrinks,

263
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:09,795
we're starting to lose one of our planet's
protective white shields.

264
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,384
For thousands of years,

265
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:19,430
there's been a balance
in the advance and retreat of the sea ice,

266
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,807
but that is no longer the case.

267
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,685
Today, during the summer months,

268
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:30,065
there is 40 percent less sea ice cover
than there was in 1980.

269
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:44,288
The Arctic is warming twice as fast
as anywhere else on our planet.

270
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:50,210
By 2040, the ocean here
will be largely free of ice

271
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,754
during the summer months.

272
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:14,193
This loss of ice will inevitably
have devastating consequences

273
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,737
for all those that still depend on it.

274
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,504
The far northeastern coast
of Russia.

275
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:55,651
This is the largest gathering
of walrus on the planet.

276
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:12,251
Over a hundred thousand have hauled out
on one single beach.

277
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:23,846
They do so out of desperation,
not out of choice.

278
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:31,186
Their natural home is out on the sea ice.

279
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,071
But the ice has retreated
away to the north,

280
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,368
and this is the closest place
to their feeding grounds,

281
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,036
where they can find rest.

282
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,929
This calf must stay close to its mother.

283
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,524
But every square inch is occupied.

284
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,880
Climbing over
the tightly packed bodies

285
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,382
is the only way across the crowd.

286
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,429
Those beneath can get crushed to death.

287
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,398
A stampede can occur out of nowhere.

288
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:25,717
Under these conditions,
walruses are a danger to themselves.

289
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:35,435
Some manage to find space
away from the crowds.

290
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,652
They struggle up the 80-meter cliffs,

291
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:54,788
an extraordinary challenge
for a one-tonne animal used to sea ice.

292
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,335
At least up here there's space to rest.
A walrus's eyesight out of water is poor,

293
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,153
but they can sense the others down below.

294
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,454
As they get hungry,
they need to return to the sea.

295
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,252
In their desperation to do so,

296
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,840
hundreds fall from heights
they should never have scaled.

297
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:36,616
These mass gatherings of walrus
are now happening almost every year.

298
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:49,421
So the lives of walruses,
like those of polar bears and seals,

299
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:50,796
are changing.

300
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,636
All are living at the frontier
of climate change,

301
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,391
and all are suffering as a consequence.

302
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:26,333
For now, the Arctic winter returns
and the sea ice reforms.

303
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,670
Order is restored.

304
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,262
Relief for the many creatures
that depend on the ice.

305
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,277
But for how much longer

306
00:51:54,653 --> 00:52:00,200
will their frozen worlds
be a part of life on our planet?
