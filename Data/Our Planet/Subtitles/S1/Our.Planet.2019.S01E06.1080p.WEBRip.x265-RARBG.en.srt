1
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,814
<i>Just 50 years ago,</i>

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>we finally ventured to the Moon.</i>

3
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,167
<i>For the very first time,</i>

4
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,837
<i>we looked back at our own planet.</i>

5
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.</i>

6
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:08,610
<i>This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain</i>

7
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,572
<i>and reveal what we must preserve</i>

8
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,868
<i>to ensure people and nature thrive.</i>

9
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,480
<i>Dolphins...</i>

10
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,024
<i>panicking.</i>

11
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:56,866
<i>They're being hunted
by false killer whales.</i>

12
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,219
<i>Dolphins are faster in short bursts.</i>

13
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,730
<i>But their hunters have stamina.</i>

14
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,701
<i>Just as the killer whales close in,</i>

15
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,748
<i>the dolphins make a sudden turn
to evade their predators.</i>

16
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:04,184
<i>These extraordinary events
are taking place far from land,</i>

17
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,144
<i>where few of us ever venture.</i>

18
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,319
<i>This is the ocean
beyond the boundary of any country...</i>

19
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:19,449
<i>largely ungoverned, wild, and lawless.</i>

20
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:38,384
<i>Nothing symbolizes
our relationship with the high seas</i>

21
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,262
<i>better than the blue whale.</i>

22
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,440
<i>Weighing 200 tons and 30 meters long,</i>

23
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,277
<i>these are the largest animals
ever to have existed.</i>

24
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:01,574
<i>Yet much of their lives
is still a mystery to us.</i>

25
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,541
<i>Blue whales live far out to sea,</i>

26
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,172
<i>roaming every ocean
from the tropics to the poles.</i>

27
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,472
<i>We have only recently discovered</i>

28
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:29,185
<i>a few special places
where they come close to shore.</i>

29
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,527
<i>The Gulf of California,</i>

30
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,991
<i>on Mexico's Pacific coast.</i>

31
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,176
<i>This is a sanctuary for blue whales.</i>

32
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,029
<i>Meet the world's biggest newborn...</i>

33
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,825
<i>a baby blue.</i>

34
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,786
<i>Just a month old,</i>

35
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,334
<i>she's already eight meters long
and weighs six tons.</i>

36
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,757
<i>Her mother shelters her
with a protective fin.</i>

37
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:50,683
<i>They caress one another,
cherishing their close bond.</i>

38
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,023
<i>These are the most intimate images
ever captured</i>

39
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,735
<i>of a blue whale mother and her calf.</i>

40
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:23,925
<i>This female will give birth
only once every two or three years,</i>

41
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:27,845
<i>so each baby blue is extremely precious.</i>

42
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,270
<i>The calf will grow three tons a month.</i>

43
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,537
<i>Once, there were
more than 300,000 blue whales,</i>

44
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,999
<i>but last century,
they were hunted relentlessly,</i>

45
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,294
<i>and only a few thousand survived.</i>

46
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,889
<i>Blue whales are now protected,</i>

47
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,268
<i>and their numbers are slowly increasing.</i>

48
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,068
<i>Soon, this calf will leave
these sheltered waters</i>

49
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,863
<i>to roam the high seas.</i>

50
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,462
<i>We once thought that the high seas
were simply too vast for us to damage,</i>

51
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:52,054
<i>but we now know that her ocean home
is under threat as never before.</i>

52
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:07,945
<i>Out here in the big blue,
there remain a few pristine places</i>

53
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,158
<i>to remind us
how rich the oceans can still be.</i>

54
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,254
<i>Spinner dolphins.</i>

55
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:32,428
<i>In the Pacific, off the coast
of Costa Rica, Central America,</i>

56
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,033
<i>they are starting to
gather in great numbers.</i>

57
00:08:38,057 --> 00:08:40,357
<i>Spinners live in pods,</i>

58
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,982
<i>groups of individuals
linked by complex social relationships.</i>

59
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,705
<i>The dolphins constantly touch
and talk with one another,</i>

60
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,042
<i>using a language of clicks and whistles.</i>

61
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,969
<i>They are shadowed by yellowfin tuna.</i>

62
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,475
<i>The tuna rely on the dolphins
to find food.</i>

63
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,605
<i>Everyone is searching for the same prey...</i>

64
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,401
<i>lantern fish...</i>

65
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,821
<i>the most numerous fish on the planet.</i>

66
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,454
<i>No longer than your finger,</i>

67
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,916
<i>lantern fish spend most of their time
hiding in the deep.</i>

68
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:49,797
<i>So, despite their astounding abundance,
we don't fish for them.</i>

69
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,679
<i>They are one of the few fish
that still thrives.</i>

70
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,022
<i>As they close in on their prey,
the dolphin pod gets bigger and bigger.</i>

71
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,363
<i>This pod could be 10,000 strong.</i>

72
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,754
<i>For every one at the surface,
20 swim below.</i>

73
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,824
<i>Using echolocation, a type of sonar,</i>

74
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,370
<i>the dolphins detect lantern fish
in the depths</i>

75
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,664
<i>and drive them to the surface.</i>

76
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,140
<i>They patrol the underside of the shoal</i>

77
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,185
<i>to stop their prey
escaping back to the deep.</i>

78
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,079
<i>Once the dolphins have had their fill,</i>

79
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,374
<i>there's still plenty more
for other predators.</i>

80
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,266
<i>Mobula rays swoop in.</i>

81
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,698
<i>To maximize their catch,
the rays attack in formation.</i>

82
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,100
<i>A wall of mouths scooping up their prey.</i>

83
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:06,702
<i>Because we don't fish for them,
lantern fish and their predators thrive.</i>

84
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:17,087
<i>All these huntersÂ have barely made a dent
in the great shoal.</i>

85
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:26,514
<i>Most life in the open ocean
is concentrated in a thin surface layer,</i>

86
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,683
<i>where the power of the sun
has its greatest effect.</i>

87
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:38,484
<i>These sunlit shallows
are fertilized in a surprising way.</i>

88
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,783
<i>As the dolphins produce waste,
they play a vital role,</i>

89
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,703
<i>recycling nutrients from the deep
up to the surface.</i>

90
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,585
<i>This marine manure</i>

91
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:02,174
<i>helps to fuel the basis
of all life in the open ocean.</i>

92
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,352
<i>Phytoplankton...</i>

93
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,481
<i>microscopic drifting plants.</i>

94
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,404
<i>They combine nutrients in seawater
with energy from the sun</i>

95
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,867
<i>to create the very foundation
of every food chain out here.</i>

96
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,876
<i>So all animals, from the smallest fish
to the largest whale,</i>

97
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,380
<i>ultimately depend
on these tiny plants for food.</i>

98
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:49,638
<i>And in turn, the phytoplankton
benefits from the nutrients</i>

99
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,599
<i>produced by these animals.</i>

100
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:03,110
<i>Crucially, phytoplankton also produce
half the oxygen in the air we breathe.</i>

101
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,615
<i>So, no matter where you live,</i>

102
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,492
<i>you can thank
these exquisite little plants</i>

103
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,494
<i>for every other breath you take.</i>

104
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,796
<i>In ideal conditions,
they can bloom to such an extent</i>

105
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,552
<i>that great swathes of the ocean
turn green.</i>

106
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:51,533
<i>Surprisingly, phytoplankton
also play a vital role in cloud formation.</i>

107
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,754
<i>Moisture evaporating from the ocean</i>

108
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,967
<i>condenses around
tiny particles created by the plankton.</i>

109
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,893
<i>These droplets combine
to grow into colossal clouds.</i>

110
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,654
<i>They can rise 20 kilometers
into the atmosphere.</i>

111
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:53,929
<i>These oceanic clouds
reflect the sun's energy back into space,</i>

112
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,766
<i>helping to protect the Earth
from rising temperatures.</i>

113
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:10,195
<i>Not only do the oceans
produce half the oxygen we breathe,</i>

114
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,198
<i>they also drive the weather and climate,</i>

115
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,120
<i>transporting life-giving fresh water
around the world.</i>

116
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:33,218
<i>The high seas
are the life-support system of our planet.</i>

117
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:44,104
<i>They have such power
simply because they're so vast.</i>

118
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,696
<i>The oceans cover two-thirds of the globe,
and that's just the surface.</i>

119
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,244
<i>They're also immensely deep.</i>

120
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,295
<i>We can only journey
to this unexplored space</i>

121
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:12,466
<i>in special submarines
that can withstand the crushing pressure.</i>

122
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:24,019
<i>The average depth of the oceans
is nearly four kilometers,</i>

123
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:29,191
<i>and the deepest point more than ten.</i>

124
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:37,324
<i>The deep makes up 95 percent
of all the space available for life.</i>

125
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,963
<i>This alien world
is home to weird and mysterious creatures.</i>

126
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,471
<i>Few are stranger than this one.</i>

127
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:18,699
<i>For years, we only knew they existed
from the occasional one washed ashore.</i>

128
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,624
<i>They have hardly ever been seen alive.</i>

129
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,009
<i>An oarfish.</i>

130
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,263
<i>Ten meters long.</i>

131
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,484
<i>Hanging vertically</i>

132
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,529
<i>and using rhythmic waves
along their dorsal fin,</i>

133
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,576
<i>oarfish commute easily
between the surface and the depths.</i>

134
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:14,004
<i>Below 200 meters,Â there's not enoughÂ light
for plants to grow,</i>

135
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:18,967
<i>so deep-sea animalsÂ depend on
food sinking down from the surface...</i>

136
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,678
<i>marine snow.</i>

137
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:29,978
<i>A crown jellyfish
drifts with tentacles outstretched</i>

138
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,605
<i>to ensnare pray.</i>

139
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,905
<i>They live in every ocean,
to depths of seven kilometers.</i>

140
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,958
<i>The deep is so vast that these could be
the most abundant of all jellyfish.</i>

141
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,632
<i>We used to think
the deep supported little life,</i>

142
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,343
<i>but scientists now believe</i>

143
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,681
<i>there are ten times more animals
living here than previously thought.</i>

144
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,436
<i>So, there must be many
yet to be discovered.</i>

145
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:33,250
<i>This deep-water crustacean,Â Cystisoma,
is as clear as glass.</i>

146
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,798
<i>It hides in plain sight.</i>

147
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,262
<i>In this twilight zone,</i>

148
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:51,601
<i>invisibility can be the difference
between finding a meal and being one.</i>

149
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,901
<i>Its huge eyes strain to see in the gloom.</i>

150
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,707
<i>No light penetrates
below a thousand meters.</i>

151
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,840
<i>In this darkness,
animals create their own light...</i>

152
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,677
<i>bioluminescence.</i>

153
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,480
<i>A glowing lure entices victims
into this dragonfish's terrifying teeth.</i>

154
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:47,366
<i>On most expeditions down here,
we are surprised by something new.</i>

155
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,250
<i>A deep-sea anglerfish.</i>

156
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,465
<i>Her extraordinary array of sensors</i>

157
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:08,845
<i>will detectÂ even the faintest movement
by prey tempted to her lure.</i>

158
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,899
<i>Here, in the deep midwater,
predators play a patient game.</i>

159
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,502
<i>Eventually, we reach the bottom,</i>

160
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,673
<i>nearly a thousand meters down.</i>

161
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,974
<i>The deep-sea plains
cover more than half the Earth's surface,</i>

162
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,980
<i>and yet we know more
about the surface of the Moon.</i>

163
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:10,449
<i>Chimaera,
an ancient relative of the shark,</i>

164
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,992
<i>up to two meters long.</i>

165
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:24,463
<i>Few species of this size
can make a living on the barren seafloor.</i>

166
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,262
<i>Moving slowly to conserve energy,</i>

167
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:36,516
<i>they use special electrical sensors
around their mouths</i>

168
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,187
<i>to search for scarce prey
buried in the sediment.</i>

169
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:55,368
<i>Rocky outcrops rising from the seafloor
can be oases in this desert.</i>

170
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,876
<i>This ragged-tooth shark
has come here for good reason.</i>

171
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,965
<i>Five hundred meters down
off the coast of Florida,</i>

172
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,885
<i>a rare hot spot of life.</i>

173
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,521
<i>Lophelia, deep-sea coral reefs.</i>

174
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,164
<i>We used to think that corals</i>

175
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,833
<i>were only found
in the warm, sunny shallows.</i>

176
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:52,551
<i>But, astonishingly, deep-sea reefs
cover a greater area of the seafloor</i>

177
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,678
<i>than their shallow-water relatives.</i>

178
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,105
<i>These underwater forests</i>

179
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:10,443
<i>provide shelter and food
for a rich community of marine life.</i>

180
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,494
<i>They're also vital nurseries
for many deep-sea creatures.</i>

181
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,925
<i>The corals are made up
of many anemone-like individuals,</i>

182
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:39,180
<i>polyps that live in colonies
connected by a hard skeleton.</i>

183
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,692
<i>The polyps
have stinging cells in their tentacles</i>

184
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:54,613
<i>to snare passing prey,
their only source of food.</i>

185
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,371
<i>But they don't always
get to keep their catch.</i>

186
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,170
<i>A bristle worm has set up home
within the coral.</i>

187
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,263
<i>It checks the polyps
for a freshly caught morsel...</i>

188
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,976
<i>and steals it from the coral.</i>

189
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,358
<i>But this theft
is actually a protection racket.</i>

190
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,034
<i>Urchins attack and eat the corals.</i>

191
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,914
<i>Time for payback.</i>

192
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:52,295
<i>The urchin may have protective spines,
but the worm has a shocking weapon,</i>

193
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,507
<i>and goes on the attack.</i>

194
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,407
<i>The urchin has been seen off,</i>

195
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,078
<i>and the worm has saved its home.</i>

196
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,165
<i>Like most deep-sea animals,</i>

197
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,129
<i>these corals grow extremely slowly.</i>

198
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,759
<i>Some reefs may be 40,000 years old.</i>

199
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:46,891
<i>Despite being so far beneath the surface,
these corals are still within our reach.</i>

200
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,651
<i>Deep-sea fishing nets
dragged across the seafloor</i>

201
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,404
<i>reduce the fragile reefs to rubble.</i>

202
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:06,077
<i>Half of all deep-sea corals
have already been destroyed.</i>

203
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,790
<i>It will take centuries
for these communities to recover.</i>

204
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,847
<i>Beyond the boundary of any one country,</i>

205
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,976
<i>the high seas
are wild and barely protected.</i>

206
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,483
<i>Wildest of all, the Southern Ocean,</i>

207
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,945
<i>home of the albatross.</i>

208
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:53,500
<i>Albatross live solitary lives
far out to sea.</i>

209
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,091
<i>They can travel
hundreds of kilometers a day,</i>

210
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,762
<i>often for weeks at a time,
searching for food.</i>

211
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,394
<i>A dead sea lion is a rare opportunity.</i>

212
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,825
<i>Giant petrels are the first to arrive.</i>

213
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:33,289
<i>They use their powerful beaks
to rip the carcass open.</i>

214
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,085
<i>Known as sea vultures,</i>

215
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,880
<i>they are the top scavenger
in Antarctic waters.</i>

216
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,189
<i>Black-browed albatross
have an extraordinary sense of smell</i>

217
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,776
<i>and can follow a scent
from 20 kilometers away.</i>

218
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,617
<i>The black-browed
must grab mouthfuls when they can.</i>

219
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:19,460
<i>They are bullied
by the more aggressive giant petrels.</i>

220
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,898
<i>Wilson's petrels are too small to compete</i>

221
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,984
<i>and pick off scraps
from the edge of the frenzy.</i>

222
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:53,620
<i>These delicate little petrels
are the most numerous of all seabirds</i>

223
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,830
<i>because they're found in every ocean.</i>

224
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,965
<i>It's only when
these normally solitary birds</i>

225
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,342
<i>gather like this</i>

226
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:12,096
<i>that we can appreciate the wealth of life
supported by the high seas.</i>

227
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,405
<i>A wandering albatross is last to arrive.</i>

228
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,626
<i>It dwarfs the other birds
and uses its great size</i>

229
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,630
<i>and three-meter wingspan to dominate.</i>

230
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,768
<i>Even the giant petrels back off.</i>

231
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,492
<i>The wanderer finally gets its share.</i>

232
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:30,008
<i>In recent years,
albatross and other seabirds</i>

233
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,676
<i>have been in decline.</i>

234
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,973
<i>Their need to travel great distances
exposes them</i>

235
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:41,769
<i>to the dangers of a poorly regulated
and overexploited ocean.</i>

236
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,858
<i>It's a problem
for all hunters of the high seas.</i>

237
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:55,450
<i>These giants cross entire oceans
in their search for food.</i>

238
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:03,374
<i>They can grow over three meters long
and weigh half a ton.</i>

239
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,924
<i>Bluefin tuna.</i>

240
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:18,890
<i>They're streamlined to perfection
and built for speed.</i>

241
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,273
<i>They hunt in great packs, hundreds strong.</i>

242
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,716
<i>The target: a school of anchovies.</i>

243
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:13,152
<i>They gently corral the anchovies
into a tight ball at the surface,</i>

244
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,866
<i>careful not to cause panic.</i>

245
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,996
<i>And then they attack.</i>

246
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,515
<i>This is a highly coordinated hunt.</i>

247
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,267
<i>The tuna take turns,</i>

248
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,979
<i>striking from the same direction
to keep the anchovies on the run.</i>

249
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:01,367
<i>After a mouthful, each bluefin peels off
to take its place at the rear.</i>

250
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,705
<i>Wave after wave continues the assault.</i>

251
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,931
<i>With their power and devastating pace,</i>

252
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:28,436
<i>bluefin tuna are one of the ocean's
most impressive hunters.</i>

253
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,409
<i>They are also
the most prized fish in the sea.</i>

254
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,541
<i>So valuable
that a single bluefin can sell in Japan</i>

255
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,668
<i>for over a million dollars.</i>

256
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,548
<i>So, perhaps it's inevitable</i>

257
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,760
<i>that they have been fished
almost to extinction.</i>

258
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,477
<i>Bluefin tuna
are not the only ones in peril.</i>

259
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,025
<i>Decades of unsustainable fishing</i>

260
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:19,237
<i>have left many fish stocks
in serious decline.</i>

261
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,076
<i>A third have collapsed.</i>

262
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,291
<i>Plastic pollution
is a grave issue for our oceans,</i>

263
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:37,213
<i>but industrial overfishing
is far more dangerous.</i>

264
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,344
<i>If we continue to harvest the seas
in this way,</i>

265
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,013
<i>it's not just fisheries
that will collapse.</i>

266
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,978
<i>The whole ocean system could follow.</i>

267
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:02,280
<i>One hundred million sharks
are killed every year,</i>

268
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,409
<i>just to make shark fin soup.</i>

269
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:21,090
<i>Ninety percent of all large ocean hunters
have disappeared.</i>

270
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:31,058
<i>Without them at the top of the food chain,
the whole community of marine life</i>

271
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,271
<i>is declining
and changing beyond recognition.</i>

272
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,755
<i>Squid are increasingly replacing fish.</i>

273
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,475
<i>We have severely depleted
both their predators and competitors,</i>

274
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,978
<i>so squid are taking over,</i>

275
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:23,569
<i>an indication
of a serious imbalance in the oceans.</i>

276
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,371
<i>Squid breed quickly
and have lots of fast-growing young,</i>

277
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:40,086
<i>so they can rapidly exploitÂ the gaps
left by the fishÂ that we have harvested.</i>

278
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,673
<i>They lay their eggsÂ in cases
on the seafloor.</i>

279
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:49,303
<i>The young develop even faster
in these warm, shallow waters.</i>

280
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,726
<i>With such drastic changes
in the marine menu,</i>

281
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,270
<i>predators are having to adapt.</i>

282
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,320
<i>Sea lions prefer to eat
more energy-rich prey,</i>

283
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,489
<i>like anchovies and sardines,</i>

284
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,367
<i>but with these in short supply,</i>

285
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,662
<i>they're forced to rely more
on a diet of squid.</i>

286
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:23,170
<i>We, too, will be forced to change
the seafood we eat</i>

287
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,673
<i>if we continue to fish as we do.</i>

288
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,264
<i>But if we harvest the oceans
in a sustainable way,</i>

289
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,684
<i>they can be marvelously productive</i>

290
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,688
<i>and will provide us
with an abundance of food.</i>

291
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,572
<i>There are already signs
that the ocean has the power</i>

292
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,032
<i>to recover astonishingly quickly.</i>

293
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,377
<i>Humpback whales.</i>

294
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,262
<i>They live in every ocean,</i>

295
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,849
<i>traveling the high seas,
from their polar feeding grounds</i>

296
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,893
<i>to the tropics, where they breed.</i>

297
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,567
<i>Yet whales have not always enjoyed
such freedom.</i>

298
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,073
<i>Once, there were
more than a hundred thousand humpbacks</i>

299
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,033
<i>in the oceans,</i>

300
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:39,079
<i>but last century,
they were hunted to near extinction.</i>

301
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:48,172
<i>Just a few thousand
survived the onslaught.</i>

302
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,766
<i>A huge public outcry</i>

303
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:04,146
<i>finally led to a ban
on commercial whaling in 1986.</i>

304
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:12,613
<i>Since then, the number of humpback whales
has been steadily increasing.</i>

305
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,497
<i>They're returning
to their ancestral feeding grounds,</i>

306
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,083
<i>like these off the coast of South Africa.</i>

307
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:38,055
<i>They are gathering to take advantage
of a seasonal abundance of krill,</i>

308
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,182
<i>tiny shrimp-like crustaceans.</i>

309
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,489
<i>The whales take in
great mouthfuls of water,</i>

310
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,243
<i>trapping the krill
on sieves of hairy bristles</i>

311
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,703
<i>that line their jaws.</i>

312
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,811
<i>Each whale can eat over a ton a day.</i>

313
00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:01,722
<i>With food so plentiful,
fur seals come to claim their share.</i>

314
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:29,833
<i>These extraordinary scenes
were unimaginable just a few years ago.</i>

315
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,311
<i>They form super-groups, hundreds strong.</i>

316
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:17,005
<i>This is the greatest gathering of whales
seen for a century.</i>

317
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:41,572
<i>Whales recycle nutrients
that enrich surface waters,</i>

318
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,700
<i>which fuel the growth of phytoplankton,</i>

319
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:50,581
<i>and they, in turn, feed krill
in a perfect self-sustaining cycle.</i>

320
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:57,045
<i>We now know that a healthy community
of great hunters,</i>

321
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:00,174
<i>whales, dolphins, tuna, and sharks,</i>

322
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,094
<i>is essential
for a fully-functioning ocean.</i>

323
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:11,894
<i>And a functioning ocean
is vital to the health of our planet</i>

324
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,771
<i>and humanity.</i>

325
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,527
<i>In a remarkable recovery,</i>

326
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,448
<i>humpback whalesÂ have almost returned
to their original numbers.</i>

327
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,495
<i>But during that time,</i>

328
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:34,917
<i>we have done more harm to the oceans
than ever before in human history.</i>

329
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,346
<i>Only with global cooperation</i>

330
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:51,183
<i>will our oceans
recover and thrive once again.</i>

331
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,607
<i>We saved the whales
by international agreement.</i>
