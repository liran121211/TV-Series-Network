2
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,772
Just 50 years ago,

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
we finally ventured to the moon.

4
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,795
For the very first time,
we looked back at our own planet.

5
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:58,683
Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.

6
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,610
This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain

7
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,280
and reveal what we must preserve

8
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,868
to ensure people and nature thrive.

9
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,805
This is a tropical forest.

10
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,599
A rain forest.

11
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,310
The richest habitat on Earth.

12
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,900
Exactly how many species
rain forests contain is unknown,

13
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,528
but it runs into millions.

14
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,948
And new ones are discovered every week.

15
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:05,416
There are some, like this clouded leopard,
we still know virtually nothing about.

16
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,222
Although they cover just seven percent
of the world's land area,

17
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:23,726
jungles play a vital role
in the health of the planet.

18
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,456
In the heart of Africa lies the Congo.

19
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:53,923
It is our planet's youngest rain forest,
a mere 18,000 years old,

20
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:58,261
and it's the jungle
with more big animals than any other.

21
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,949
A family of lowland gorillas.

22
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,165
They're led by this silverback,
the dominant male.

23
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,049
He's as tall as a man,
but twice the weight.

24
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,220
His family depend on him for survival.

25
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,518
As their guardian,
he must keep a lookout for danger.

26
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:01,115
A rival male might usurp him
and tear his family apart.

27
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:07,705
But there is one threat
beyond his control.

28
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,584
In the last 20 years,

29
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:16,089
poaching for bushmeat has halved
the Congo's gorilla population.

30
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,146
His kind are now critically endangered.

31
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,167
It's only a forest elephant,
which needn't concern the silverback.

32
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,887
But the elephant
has reason to be wary of poachers too.

33
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,644
Their long straight tusks
are even more sought after

34
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,022
than those of their grassland cousins.

35
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,406
He follows paths

36
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,326
made by generations of elephants
before him,

37
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,119
searching for food.

38
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,921
Like the elephant, the silverback's family
will travel several kilometers a day,

39
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,007
looking for fruits and seeds.

40
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,599
They and the elephants
are the gardeners of this jungle.

41
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,268
The seed dispersers.

42
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,272
And many of the trees here

43
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,233
owe their existence
to these large animals.

44
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:10,703
Here,
all paths eventually lead to Mbeli Bai.

45
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:22,799
Open areas like this are a unique feature
of the Congo's jungles,

46
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,552
and there are more than a hundred
dotted throughout the forest.

47
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:35,269
Known as bais, these clearings attract
many of the jungle's inhabitants.

48
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,743
The silverback
cautiously leads the way,

49
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,539
but his family are close behind.

50
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:24,235
The gorillas come to feed
on aquatic plants rich in salt,

51
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,780
a mineral in short supply
inside the forest,

52
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,324
but crucial to their survival.

53
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:47,967
Elephants mine salts from the mud
using their trunks.

54
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,936
Or just drink the mineral-enriched water.

55
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,822
The silverback's family
are not the only gorillas here.

56
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,577
Nearly 200 others also use this bai,

57
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,748
as well as more than 530 elephants,

58
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,126
a measure of Mbeli's importance.

59
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,221
For the elephants,
the bais have another vital role.

60
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,684
Most of their lives are spent

61
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,979
roaming the vast forested interior
on their own,

62
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,442
so it's only here
they get a chance to meet others.

63
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:59,872
Unlike most of the Congo's other bais,
Mbeli is well protected,

64
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,250
making it a refuge from poaching.

65
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,132
It's only when they leave
that the danger returns.

66
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,889
And as the Congo's main seed dispersers,

67
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,352
the loss of its megafauna
could have a far-reaching impact

68
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,232
on the future of our planet's
second-largest rain forest.

69
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,326
Jungles may look the same,

70
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,955
but each is home
to a unique cast of characters.

71
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,754
New Guinea is the world's largest
jungle-covered island,

72
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,716
and more than half
of its plants and animals

73
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,176
are found nowhere else on Earth.

74
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,810
Its turbulent geological past
has shaped this vast island

75
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:06,981
into a dramatic landscape
of mountains and valleys.

76
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,197
A process
that isolated one species from another.

77
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,536
Separated in this way,

78
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,123
New Guinea's animals
have become truly bizarre.

79
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,879
The male twelve-wired bird-of-paradise

80
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,924
is the only bird in the world
that has tail ornaments like this,

81
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:39,138
used to tickle
the face of a prospective mate.

82
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,934
From one crow-like ancestor,

83
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,314
birds-of-paradise have evolved
into 40 different kinds.

84
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,486
Every corner of this island
has its own version.

85
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:59,659
Meet the black sicklebill
of New Guinea's highlands…

86
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,875
…able to morph
into some very un-birdlike shapes.

87
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,430
Each male bird-of-paradise
has a unique display for attracting mates,

88
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,600
and none is more extraordinary

89
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,062
than the one that takes place
on this stage.

90
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,738
For the owner, a western parotia,
there's work to be done first.

91
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,079
Every morning, he clears his court
of the night's fallen debris.

92
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,879
It's a vital chore
if he wants to attract a mate.

93
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,844
Females only visit the tidiest courts,

94
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:06,559
so one rogue leaf might ruin his chances.

95
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,861
Perfect.

96
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,824
His obsessive housework pays off,

97
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,536
and a female drops in for a closer look.

98
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,832
Now is his chance to really impress,

99
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,293
but it won't be easy.

100
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,588
Females are very fussy,

101
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,133
and she'll expect
his carefully choreographed routine

102
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,258
to be faultless.

103
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,138
He opens with a bow.

104
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,851
Next, his blue eye must flash yellow.

105
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,981
So far, so good.

106
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,027
He has all the moves.

107
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,155
Fancy footwork.

108
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,910
The whirling dervish.

109
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,836
The head plume shuffle, with spin.

110
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,509
Her erect head feathers
and quivering wings

111
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,511
are a very encouraging sign.

112
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,689
His sidestep and head bob
look good from any angle,

113
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,484
but his crowning glory

114
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,987
can only be appreciated
from her perspective.

115
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,406
Wait for it.

116
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,454
There it is.
A flash of his iridescent throat patch.

117
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:55,864
Her excitement grows.
His performance has been a triumph,

118
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,525
and he wins her approval.

119
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:32,246
New Guinea's isolation
has created a unique variety of animals,

120
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,543
but the age of a forest
has an even greater impact

121
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,962
on the diversity of life it contains.

122
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,385
The jungles of Borneo, in Southeast Asia,

123
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,848
have grown here
for nearly 130 million years,

124
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,059
making them the oldest on Earth.

125
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:03,235
This limestone mountaintop
in Borneo's highlands

126
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,654
was originally formed under the sea.

127
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,036
Time and rain
has slowly shaped this jungle fortress

128
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,747
into these 40-meter towers.

129
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,261
The great age of this island's jungle
is best illustrated

130
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,514
by one of the oldest predators on Earth.

131
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,652
A velvet worm.

132
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,323
Completely at home
on the humid forest floor.

133
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,746
They've been here
since the age of the dinosaurs,

134
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,999
and have remained virtually unchanged.

135
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,052
It detects its insect prey
through vibration and touch.

136
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,597
But with no turn of speed,

137
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:17,017
how does it capture
these fleet-footed critters?

138
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,898
The answer is stranger than fiction.

139
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,072
Glue guns.

140
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,412
The sticky slime hardens on impact,

141
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,124
trapping the luckless insect.

142
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:45,045
The velvet worm will inject the cockroach
with digestive saliva,

143
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,507
and then suck out its insides.

144
00:16:55,556 --> 00:17:00,477
The high humidity of the forest floor
isn't just good for velvet worms.

145
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,777
It's perfect for fungi, too,

146
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,366
and Borneo's ancient jungles
are rich in species.

147
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:28,797
By decomposing the dead,

148
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:34,136
the slime molds and fungi
recycle scarce nutrients.

149
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:55,949
Time has made Borneo's jungles
extraordinarily rich and diverse.

150
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,454
Here, in just a few hectares of forest,

151
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,917
there may be more kinds of plants
than in the whole of Europe,

152
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:12,424
including
some of the most specialized on Earth.

153
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,015
Over several weeks,

154
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:25,145
these growing tips inflate
to form jugs or pitchers.

155
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:38,075
There are 39 kinds of pitcher plant
in Borneo,

156
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,078
and most are found nowhere else.

157
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:49,753
To get the nutrients they need to survive,
pitcher plants rely on animals,

158
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,548
often in surprising ways.

159
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:02,266
This is the mountain treeshrew,
an animal found only in Borneo.

160
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,779
Every morning, the treeshrew visits
his neighborhood pitchers.

161
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,241
It depends on the sugary solution

162
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,452
that exudes
from hairs on the pitcher's lid.

163
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,750
When he's licked this lid dry,
he'll move to another.

164
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,422
And then another.

165
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:42,723
Eventually, all that sugar
can have only one result.

166
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:54,568
In return for the free food,
the treeshrew leaves a gift.

167
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,071
Fertilizer for the plant.

168
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:03,368
All that's needed is an afternoon shower

169
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,164
to flush the shrew poo
into the pitcher's bowl.

170
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:17,090
Without these added nitrates,
the plant couldn't survive.

171
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:24,431
And the quest for nutrients has led
some pitchers down a sinister path.

172
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,854
A gracilis pitcher plant

173
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,734
attracts ants to the underside of its lid
with drops of nectar.

174
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,656
But what do the ants give in return?

175
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,287
It's a story that also depends on rain.

176
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,625
The force of the raindrops

177
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,378
make it impossible
for the ants to hold on.

178
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:05,222
It's the plant world's
only springboard trap.

179
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,560
This pitcher plant
feeds on ant bodies.

180
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,613
All pitcher plants
depend on animals for survival,

181
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,868
and one has even gone into business
with a bat.

182
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,624
The woolly bat finds hemsleyana pitchers

183
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:38,338
because the plant's broad back wall
reflects the bat's ultrasound.

184
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,348
The tube-like pitchers
are the perfect roosting site.

185
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,230
The pitcher provides secure accommodation

186
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,651
and the plant is enriched
by its guest's deposits.

187
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,868
Relationships like these
have taken millions of years to evolve,

188
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,246
but many could be gone in a decade.

189
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:20,005
In the last 50 years,
Borneo has lost over half of its jungle.

190
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,260
And it's even worse

191
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,971
on the neighboring islands
of the Philippines.

192
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:34,227
Here, 90 percent
of the primary rain forest has gone.

193
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:46,490
What's left is the last refuge
for the world's rarest bird of prey.

194
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,826
The mighty Philippines eagle.

195
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,628
With just 400 pairs remaining,

196
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,173
a chick on a nest is a very scarce sight.

197
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,472
Scientists have tracked the mother
since she was a year old.

198
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,643
Now aged ten, this is her first chick.

199
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:26,029
It's four months old,
already nearly a meter tall,

200
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,740
and increasingly confident.

201
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,996
Although Mother still likes to give
a helping hand.

202
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,215
The chick is very demanding.
She expects regular food drops,

203
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:56,935
but, like a toddler having a tantrum,
she doesn't want any help at mealtimes.

204
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,025
Already, she's the same size as her father

205
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,528
and too big to argue with.

206
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,283
But if his youngster
is to take her next steps,

207
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,744
he knows it's time for some tough love.

208
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,249
From now on,
visits will be less frequent.

209
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,764
The parents drop by
with an occasional food parcel,

210
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:41,104
but a small fruit bat
isn't much to get excited about.

211
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,779
It's confusing

212
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:53,950
when your parents don't visit
as frequently as they once did.

213
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,630
Every day, she calls,

214
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,383
but no one is paying any attention.

215
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,639
She's hungry,

216
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,352
and all that's left are scraps.

217
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,236
It's time to become a proper eagle.

218
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:38,453
Flapping strengthens flight muscles
in two-meter wings.

219
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:46,586
Wings that will be used
to carry off her hefty prey.

220
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,803
Though that skill is still some time off.

221
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,728
So far, she's never ventured
beyond the security of her nest.

222
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,485
And with good reason.

223
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,868
There's a 70-meter drop
to the forest floor.

224
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,667
A fall would be fatal.

225
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:37,053
It's a nervous moment,
but she must persevere.

226
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,350
Right now, she's all toes and talons.

227
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:58,325
Sudden gusts of wind are not helpful
when balancing over a death-defying drop,

228
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,705
and the daily downpours
don't make it any easier.

229
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:18,845
Every day, she gets a little stronger
and more confident.

230
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:30,398
Then, the day comes when confidence
finally matches know-how.

231
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:51,503
Now is the moment to reach for the sky.

232
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,515
Her first ever flight from her nest tree.

233
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:10,980
It'll be nearly a year
before she's fully independent.

234
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,319
Then, her survival
will depend on finding a territory

235
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,781
with large stretches of unspoilt jungle.

236
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,456
In the Philippines' fragmented forest,

237
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,669
there's just too little prey
for a supersized eagle.

238
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,719
But there is one jungle
whose size is still legendary.

239
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:49,144
The Amazon basin
is over 3,000 kilometers across

240
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:53,732
and home to half of our planet's
remaining rain forest.

241
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:04,743
But there are challenges for those
living in the Amazon's deep interior.

242
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,087
Black spider monkeys,

243
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,841
with eyes on a salt lick.

244
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:27,932
Being so far from the sea,
salt is in short supply here,

245
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,352
so a visit to a lick is essential.

246
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:40,236
But first, they must be sure
there are no predators lurking below.

247
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,450
A harmless agouti is a good sign.

248
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:58,338
This is the only time a spider monkey
ever sets foot on the ground.

249
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,887
And if you have your head in a hole,

250
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:08,973
best to have a lookout.

251
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,604
Monkeys can't survive
without these minerals,

252
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,524
and predators know it.

253
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,864
A warning from the lookout.

254
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,168
It's not a false alarm.

255
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,548
A jaguar.

256
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,846
Rarely seen,
but the Amazon's top predator.

257
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,607
With the jaguar gone, the monkeys return,

258
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,527
but it's a risk.

259
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:06,155
Nobody knows
when the predator will be back.

260
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:18,126
It's not just spider monkeys
for whom fear must give way to need.

261
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:23,965
In the Amazon, salt licks are as vital
as an oasis in a desert.

262
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,182
Noises could be friend or foe,

263
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,936
so every visitor
must remain poised for flight.

264
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,961
It's a false alarm.

265
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,505
Just the harmless agouti again.

266
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:14,557
In the Amazon, every animal group
has more species than anywhere else.

267
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,479
And that includes frogs.

268
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:26,611
There are thought to be over a thousand
different kinds of them here,

269
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,493
and new ones are still being discovered.

270
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,971
Frogs are an indicator
of a healthy forest,

271
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:59,727
but its most important residents
are the jungle's smallest inhabitants.

272
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:21,833
There are thought to be over two million
kinds of insect in the Amazon.

273
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,670
These are the most numerous.

274
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:35,054
A colony of leafcutter ants
can run into the millions.

275
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,356
Each colony is a superorganism
with a collective function…

276
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:51,070
to gather leaves and carry them back
to their underground nests.

277
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,595
Within the territory
of a leafcutter colony,

278
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:21,684
as much as a fifth of all new plant growth
will be harvested by the ants.

279
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,564
Slicing through leaves
with specialized mandibles,

280
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:32,070
they produce high frequency vibrations,
which stiffens the leaf,

281
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,280
making it easier to cut.

282
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:41,162
Working together,
they can strip a tree bare in 24 hours.

283
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,385
The trick is holding on to your leaf
as you fall.

284
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,892
Easier said than done.

285
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:08,022
But best not to return to the nest
empty-handed.

286
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:19,075
A leafcutter colony
is like a mega-herbivore,

287
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,828
not dissimilar
to an elephant in the Congo,

288
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,998
and their impact on the ecosystem
is just as important.

289
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:32,046
The ants follow scent trails
back to the nest,

290
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,552
dodging unexpected obstacles.

291
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:47,061
But to increase efficiency,
the ants keep their paths clear of debris.

292
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:08,082
A leafcutter nest
can be up to eight meters deep

293
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,419
and have thousands
of interconnected chambers.

294
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,134
The workers
carry the freshly harvested leaves

295
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,845
to special rooms for processing.

296
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:28,686
The leaves are not food,
but used to create gardens of fungus,

297
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,646
which they feed to their larvae.

298
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:40,823
The success of the colony depends on
keeping their gardens disease-free.

299
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:46,787
So, the ants have teamed up
with bacteria to help control pathogens,

300
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:49,248
which would destroy their precious fungi.

301
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,837
Scientists now believe

302
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:59,300
these bacteria could provide
new solutions to human diseases.

303
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,473
But as successful as these ants are,

304
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:11,604
the rain forest's diversity depends on
no one species gaining the upper hand.

305
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,572
Here,
ants don't have it all their own way.

306
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,245
This one is behaving oddly.

307
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,336
It seems compelled to climb upwards,

308
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:39,048
and is already
several meters above the forest floor.

309
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,844
Something has taken control
of its movements,

310
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:47,431
like a puppeteer
pulling at the strings of a marionette.

311
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:58,943
There's just one final act,
for which the ant has no choice.

312
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:08,995
It must find a place to bite down,
tethering it to the vegetation.

313
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:26,762
With the ant in its death grip,

314
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:31,517
a parasitic fungus, Cordyceps,
erupts from its body.

315
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:46,240
Finally, the fruiting body of the fungus
bursts from its head.

316
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:05,843
From this bulbous container,
spores will be cast into the air currents,

317
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,055
where they will claim more ant victims.

318
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:15,061
But it's not just ants.

319
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:19,315
Many others are infected
by the Cordyceps fungus.

320
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,544
The more numerous a species is,

321
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:44,965
the more likely it is to fall victim
to the killer fungus.

322
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:57,269
Checks and balances like these
means no one species can ever dominate,

323
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,482
so protecting
the jungle's incredible diversity.

324
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:19,417
But today,
the diversity of the world's rain forests

325
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,253
is falling at an alarming rate,

326
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:25,005
and that is because of us.

327
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:34,974
We have now replaced
up to 27 million hectares of virgin jungle

328
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,810
with a single species of tree.

329
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,233
This is oil palm,

330
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,194
one of the world's most productive crops.

331
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,864
But these monocultures

332
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:55,494
support only a fraction of the diversity
found in primary rain forests,

333
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,540
and it is pushing many animals
to extinction.

334
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,506
In the swamp forests of northern Sumatra,
in Indonesia,

335
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:11,760
time is running out
for one of our closest ancestors.

336
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,598
The orangutan.

337
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:25,858
A baby orangutan takes more than ten years
to become independent.

338
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,654
Everything must be learned
from its mother.

339
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,992
Like how to bridge the gaps between trees.

340
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,292
Survival depends on each orang

341
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,462
understanding its patch of forest
perfectly.

342
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:53,636
Watching scientists
have named this pair Ellie and Eden.

343
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,973
Ellie is 18 years old,

344
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,770
and Eden, her first baby, is three.

345
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:11,403
Right now,
he needs a little bit of encouragement.

346
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,373
Like all orangutans,

347
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,584
Ellie has a mental map
of her surroundings,

348
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:29,838
including the location
of every fruiting tree.

349
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,137
Eden needs to learn this, too,

350
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,517
but for now,
he must watch everything his mother does,

351
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:47,690
learning not just what's edible
but also how to eat it.

352
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:02,037
Every day is a new lesson for Eden.

353
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:11,130
Here, ants are a big part of their diet,
and there's a knack to gathering them.

354
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,471
Once tangled in Ellie's fur,
they're easy to pick off.

355
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:28,314
For little Eden,
it's all about watching and learning.

356
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,741
Eden's cousin, Louis, is more experienced.

357
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,577
Four years older than Eden,

358
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,455
he can move through the branches
with ease.

359
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,885
It's taken a few years to master,

360
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,473
and it's clearly a skill
he feels is worth showing off.

361
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:18,697
Conquering the treetops is just stage one
in an orangutan's education.

362
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,159
To survive, Louis must learn more.

363
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,038
Much more.

364
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,336
His mother, Lisa,
has found a rotten tree trunk

365
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,630
with lots of ants.

366
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:40,052
But this anting opportunity
requires more know-how.

367
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,973
To get them, Lisa must break sections off.

368
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,899
At his age, Louis must do more than watch.

369
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,945
He must copy.

370
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,005
Not a bad effort.

371
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:26,974
But even at the age of seven,
he's yet to master the art of ant capture.

372
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,107
Louis has much to learn.

373
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:44,074
Pluto, on the other hand,
graduated a long time ago.

374
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,829
Thirty years old
and nearly a hundred kilograms,

375
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,123
he is king of this jungle.

376
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,129
His cheek flanges are a sign of power,

377
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,257
something for Louis to aspire to.

378
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,974
Pluto is constantly
on the lookout for food,

379
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,729
and he's just spotted
a promising opportunity.

380
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,860
These wasps mean one thing to him.

381
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,155
Tasty grubs.

382
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:33,123
To get at them,
he favors a smash-and-grab technique.

383
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:43,300
His thick fur protects him
from most of the angry wasps,

384
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,762
but the rewards
are worth risking a few stings.

385
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,353
Louis keeps his distance.

386
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,609
He would need to be
a lot bigger and hairier

387
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:02,820
before he could do battle with wasps.

388
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:15,123
But here, there's one trick that can take
half a lifetime to get to grips with.

389
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:27,094
Louis' mother, Lisa, has learned
how to make tools from sticks,

390
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:29,388
to winkle out insects.

391
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,141
The orangutans living here

392
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:36,728
are the only ones in the world
to have discovered this skill.

393
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,359
Louis must try and learn it too,

394
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:46,113
but it may be another eight years
before he's as good as his mother.

395
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:52,369
This long education has made orangutans

396
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:56,206
particularly vulnerable
to changes taking place in their forest.

397
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:06,341
It's now estimated that we lose
100 orangutans every week

398
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,468
from human activity.

399
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:23,400
Louis and Eden's generation
could be the last wild orangutan.

400
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:33,744
When Pluto was their age,
his jungle home stretched to the horizon.

401
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,084
Not anymore.

402
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,256
In the last four decades,

403
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:50,636
the pristine lowland jungle
that orangutans depend on

404
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:55,474
has declined by a staggering 75 percent.

405
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:02,189
Across the world,
we are losing tropical forest

406
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:07,110
at the rate
of nearly 15 million hectares every year,

407
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:12,574
and with it,
the planet's treasure trove of diversity.

408
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:21,917
Jungles store and capture more carbon
than any other habitat on land.

409
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,920
They cool our planet,

410
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,798
provide food and medicines.

411
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,052
We lose them at our peril.
