2
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,814
Just 50 years ago,

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
we finally ventured to the Moon.

4
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,167
 For the very first time,

5
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,837
we looked back at our own planet.

6
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:58,600
Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.

7
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:08,610
This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain

8
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,572
and reveal what we must preserve

9
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,868
to ensure people and nature thrive.

10
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,562
Dolphins…

11
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,190
panicking.

12
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:56,866
They're being hunted
by false killer whales.

13
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,219
Dolphins are faster in short bursts.

14
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,730
But their hunters have stamina.

15
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:39,701
Just as the killer whales close in,

16
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:45,748
the dolphins make a sudden turn
to evade their predators.

17
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:04,184
These extraordinary events
are taking place far from land,

18
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,144
where few of us ever venture.

19
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,319
This is the ocean
beyond the boundary of any country…

20
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:19,449
largely ungoverned, wild, and lawless.

21
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:38,384
Nothing symbolizes
our relationship with the high seas

22
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,262
better than the blue whale.

23
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,440
Weighing 200 tons and 30 meters long,

24
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,277
these are the largest animals
ever to have existed.

25
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:01,574
Yet much of their lives
is still a mystery to us.

26
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,541
Blue whales live far out to sea,

27
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,172
roaming every ocean
from the tropics to the poles.

28
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,472
We have only recently discovered

29
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:29,185
a few special places
where they come close to shore.

30
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,527
The Gulf of California,

31
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,991
on Mexico's Pacific coast.

32
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,176
This is a sanctuary for blue whales.

33
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,029
Meet the world's biggest newborn…

34
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,825
a baby blue.

35
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,786
Just a month old,

36
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,334
she's already eight meters long
and weighs six tons.

37
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,757
Her mother shelters her
with a protective fin.

38
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:50,683
They caress one another,
cherishing their close bond.

39
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,023
These are the most intimate images
ever captured

40
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,735
of a blue whale mother and her calf.

41
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:23,925
This female will give birth
only once every two or three years,

42
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:27,845
so each baby blue is extremely precious.

43
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:36,270
The calf will grow three tons a month.

44
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:52,537
Once, there were
more than 300,000 blue whales,

45
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,999
but last century,
they were hunted relentlessly,

46
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,294
and only a few thousand survived.

47
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,889
Blue whales are now protected,

48
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,268
and their numbers are slowly increasing.

49
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,068
Soon, this calf will leave
these sheltered waters

50
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,863
to roam the high seas.

51
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:42,462
We once thought that the high seas
were simply too vast for us to damage,

52
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:52,054
but we now know that her ocean home
is under threat as never before.

53
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:07,945
Out here in the big blue,
there remain a few pristine places

54
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:12,158
to remind us
how rich the oceans can still be.

55
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,254
Spinner dolphins.

56
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:32,428
In the Pacific, off the coast
of Costa Rica, Central America,

57
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,152
they are starting to gather
in great numbers.
Spinners live in pods,

58
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,982
groups of individuals
linked by complex social relationships.

59
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,705
The dolphins constantly touch
and talk with one another,

60
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,042
using a language of clicks and whistles.

61
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,969
They are shadowed by yellowfin tuna.

62
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,475
The tuna rely on the dolphins
to find food.

63
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,605
Everyone is searching for the same prey…

64
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,441
lantern fish…

65
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,821
the most numerous fish on the planet.

66
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,454
No longer than your finger,

67
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,916
lantern fish spend most of their time
hiding in the deep.

68
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:49,797
So, despite their astounding abundance,
we don't fish for them.

69
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,679
They are one of the few fish
that still thrives.

70
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,022
As they close in on their prey,
the dolphin pod gets bigger and bigger.

71
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,363
This pod could be 10,000 strong.

72
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,754
For every one at the surface,
20 swim below.

73
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,824
Using echolocation, a type of sonar,

74
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,370
the dolphins detect lantern fish
in the depths

75
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,664
and drive them to the surface.

76
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:23,140
They patrol the underside of the shoal

77
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:26,185
to stop their prey
escaping back to the deep.

78
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,079
Once the dolphins have had their fill,

79
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,374
there's still plenty more
for other predators.

80
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,266
Mobula rays swoop in.

81
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,698
To maximize their catch,
the rays attack in formation.

82
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,100
A wall of mouths scooping up their prey.

83
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:06,702
Because we don't fish for them,
lantern fish and their predators thrive.

84
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:17,087
All these hunters have barely made a dent
in the great shoal.

85
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:26,514
Most life in the open ocean
is concentrated in a thin surface layer,

86
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,683
where the power of the sun
has its greatest effect.

87
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:38,484
These sunlit shallows
are fertilized in a surprising way.

88
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,783
As the dolphins produce waste,
they play a vital role,

89
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:49,703
recycling nutrients from the deep
up to the surface.

90
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,585
This marine manure

91
00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:02,174
helps to fuel the basis
of all life in the open ocean.

92
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,352
Phytoplankton…

93
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,481
microscopic drifting plants.

94
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,404
They combine nutrients in seawater
with energy from the sun

95
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,867
to create the very foundation
of every food chain out here.

96
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:36,876
So all animals, from the smallest fish
to the largest whale,

97
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,380
ultimately depend
on these tiny plants for food.

98
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:49,638
And in turn, the phytoplankton
benefits from the nutrients

99
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,599
produced by these animals.

100
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:03,110
Crucially, phytoplankton also produce
half the oxygen in the air we breathe.

101
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,615
So, no matter where you live,

102
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,492
you can thank
these exquisite little plants

103
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,494
for every other breath you take.

104
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,796
In ideal conditions,
they can bloom to such an extent

105
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,552
that great swathes of the ocean
turn green.

106
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:51,533
Surprisingly, phytoplankton
also play a vital role in cloud formation.

107
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,754
Moisture evaporating from the ocean

108
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,967
condenses around
tiny particles created by the plankton.

109
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,893
These droplets combine
to grow into colossal clouds.

110
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,654
They can rise 20 kilometers
into the atmosphere.

111
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:53,929
These oceanic clouds
reflect the sun's energy back into space,

112
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,766
helping to protect the Earth
from rising temperatures.

113
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:10,195
Not only do the oceans
produce half the oxygen we breathe,

114
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,198
they also drive the weather and climate,

115
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,120
transporting life-giving fresh water
around the world.

116
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:33,218
The high seas
are the life-support system of our planet.

117
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:44,104
They have such power
simply because they're so vast.

118
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,696
The oceans cover two-thirds of the globe,
and that's just the surface.

119
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,244
They're also immensely deep.

120
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:08,295
We can only journey
to this unexplored space

121
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:12,466
in special submarines
that can withstand the crushing pressure.

122
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:24,019
The average depth of the oceans
is nearly four kilometers,

123
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:29,191
and the deepest point more than ten.

124
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:37,324
The deep makes up 95 percent
of all the space available for life.

125
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:50,963
This alien world
is home to weird and mysterious creatures.

126
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,471
Few are stranger than this one.

127
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:18,699
For years, we only knew they existed
from the occasional one washed ashore.

128
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,624
They have hardly ever been seen alive.

129
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,009
An oarfish.

130
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,263
Ten meters long.

131
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,484
Hanging vertically

132
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,529
and using rhythmic waves
along their dorsal fin,

133
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,576
oarfish commute easily
between the surface and the depths.

134
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:14,004
Below 200 meters, there's not enough light
for plants to grow,

135
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:18,967
so deep-sea animals depend on
food sinking down from the surface…

136
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,678
marine snow.

137
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:29,978
A crown jellyfish
drifts with tentacles outstretched

138
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,605
to ensnare pray.

139
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,905
They live in every ocean,
to depths of seven kilometers.

140
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,958
The deep is so vast that these could be
the most abundant of all jellyfish.

141
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,632
We used to think
the deep supported little life,

142
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,343
but scientists now believe

143
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,681
there are ten times more animals
living here than previously thought.

144
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,436
So, there must be many
yet to be discovered.

145
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:33,250
This deep-water crustacean, Cystisoma,
is as clear as glass.

146
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,798
It hides in plain sight.

147
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,262
In this twilight zone,

148
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:51,601
invisibility can be the difference
between finding a meal and being one.

149
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:59,901
Its huge eyes strain to see in the gloom.

150
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,707
No light penetrates
below a thousand meters.

151
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,840
In this darkness,
animals create their own light…

152
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,677
bioluminescence.

153
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:36,480
A glowing lure entices victims
into this dragonfish's terrifying teeth.

154
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:47,366
On most expeditions down here,
we are surprised by something new.

155
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,250
A deep-sea anglerfish.

156
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,465
Her extraordinary array of sensors

157
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:08,845
will detect even the faintest movement
by prey tempted to her lure.

158
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,899
Here, in the deep midwater,
predators play a patient game.

159
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,502
Eventually, we reach the bottom,

160
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,673
nearly a thousand meters down.

161
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,974
The deep-sea plains
cover more than half the Earth's surface,

162
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,980
and yet we know more
about the surface of the Moon.

163
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:10,449
Chimaera,
an ancient relative of the shark,

164
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,992
up to two meters long.

165
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:24,463
Few species of this size
can make a living on the barren seafloor.

166
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,262
Moving slowly to conserve energy,

167
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:36,516
they use special electrical sensors
around their mouths

168
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,187
to search for scarce prey
buried in the sediment.

169
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:55,368
Rocky outcrops rising from the seafloor
can be oases in this desert.

170
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,876
This ragged-tooth shark
has come here for good reason.

171
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,965
Five hundred meters down
off the coast of Florida,

172
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,885
a rare hot spot of life.

173
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:22,521
Lophelia, deep-sea coral reefs.

174
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,164
We used to think that corals

175
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,833
were only found
in the warm, sunny shallows.

176
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:52,551
But, astonishingly, deep-sea reefs
cover a greater area of the seafloor

177
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,678
than their shallow-water relatives.

178
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,105
These underwater forests

179
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:10,443
provide shelter and food
for a rich community of marine life.

180
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,494
They're also vital nurseries
for many deep-sea creatures.

181
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,925
The corals are made up
of many anemone-like individuals,

182
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:39,180
polyps that live in colonies
connected by a hard skeleton.

183
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,692
The polyps
have stinging cells in their tentacles

184
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:54,613
to snare passing prey,
their only source of food.

185
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,371
But they don't always
get to keep their catch.

186
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,170
A bristle worm has set up home
within the coral.

187
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,263
It checks the polyps
for a freshly caught morsel…

188
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,976
and steals it from the coral.

189
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,358
But this theft
is actually a protection racket.

190
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,034
Urchins attack and eat the corals.

191
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,914
Time for payback.

192
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:52,295
The urchin may have protective spines,
but the worm has a shocking weapon,

193
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,507
and goes on the attack.

194
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,407
The urchin has been seen off,

195
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,078
and the worm has saved its home.

196
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,165
Like most deep-sea animals,

197
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:34,129
these corals grow extremely slowly.

198
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,759
Some reefs may be 40,000 years old.

199
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:46,891
Despite being so far beneath the surface,
these corals are still within our reach.

200
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:56,651
Deep-sea fishing nets
dragged across the seafloor

201
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,404
reduce the fragile reefs to rubble.

202
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:06,077
Half of all deep-sea corals
have already been destroyed.

203
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,790
It will take centuries
for these communities to recover.

204
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,847
Beyond the boundary of any one country,

205
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:29,976
the high seas
are wild and barely protected.

206
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,483
Wildest of all, the Southern Ocean,

207
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,945
home of the albatross.

208
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:53,500
Albatross live solitary lives
far out to sea.

209
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,091
They can travel
hundreds of kilometers a day,

210
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,762
often for weeks at a time,
searching for food.

211
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,394
A dead sea lion is a rare opportunity.

212
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,825
Giant petrels are the first to arrive.

213
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:33,289
They use their powerful beaks
to rip the carcass open.

214
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,085
Known as sea vultures,

215
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,880
they are the top scavenger
in Antarctic waters.

216
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:58,189
Black-browed albatross
have an extraordinary sense of smell

217
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,776
and can follow a scent
from 20 kilometers away.

218
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:09,617
The black-browed
must grab mouthfuls when they can.

219
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:19,460
They are bullied
by the more aggressive giant petrels.

220
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,898
Wilson's petrels are too small to compete

221
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,984
and pick off scraps
from the edge of the frenzy.

222
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:53,620
These delicate little petrels
are the most numerous of all seabirds

223
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,830
because they're found in every ocean.

224
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,965
It's only when
these normally solitary birds

225
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,342
gather like this

226
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:12,096
that we can appreciate the wealth of life
supported by the high seas.

227
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,405
A wandering albatross is last to arrive.

228
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,626
It dwarfs the other birds
and uses its great size

229
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,630
and three-meter wingspan to dominate.

230
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,768
Even the giant petrels back off.

231
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:14,492
The wanderer finally gets its share.

232
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:30,008
In recent years,
albatross and other seabirds

233
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,676
have been in decline.

234
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,973
Their need to travel great distances
exposes them

235
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:41,769
to the dangers of a poorly regulated
and overexploited ocean.

236
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,858
It's a problem
for all hunters of the high seas.

237
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:55,450
These giants cross entire oceans
in their search for food.

238
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:03,374
They can grow over three meters long
and weigh half a ton.

239
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,924
Bluefin tuna.

240
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:18,890
They're streamlined to perfection
and built for speed.

241
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,273
They hunt in great packs, hundreds strong.

242
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,716
The target: a school of anchovies.

243
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:13,152
They gently corral the anchovies
into a tight ball at the surface,

244
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,866
careful not to cause panic.

245
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,996
And then they attack.

246
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,515
This is a highly coordinated hunt.

247
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:44,267
The tuna take turns,

248
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,979
striking from the same direction
to keep the anchovies on the run.

249
00:35:56,612 --> 00:36:01,367
After a mouthful, each bluefin peels off
to take its place at the rear.

250
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,705
Wave after wave continues the assault.

251
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,931
With their power and devastating pace,

252
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:28,436
bluefin tuna are one of the ocean's
most impressive hunters.

253
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,409
They are also
the most prized fish in the sea.

254
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,541
So valuable
that a single bluefin can sell in Japan

255
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,668
for over a million dollars.

256
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,548
So, perhaps it's inevitable

257
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,760
that they have been fished
almost to extinction.

258
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,477
Bluefin tuna
are not the only ones in peril.

259
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,025
Decades of unsustainable fishing

260
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:19,237
have left many fish stocks
in serious decline.

261
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,076
A third have collapsed altogether.

262
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:32,291
Plastic pollution
is a grave issue for our oceans,

263
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:37,213
but industrial overfishing
is far more dangerous.

264
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,344
If we continue to harvest the seas
in this way,

265
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,013
it's not just fisheries
that will collapse.

266
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,978
The whole ocean system could follow.

267
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:02,280
One hundred million sharks
are killed every year,

268
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,409
just to make shark fin soup.

269
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:21,090
Ninety percent of all large ocean hunters
have disappeared.

270
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:31,058
Without them at the top of the food chain,
the whole community of marine life

271
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:35,271
is declining
and changing beyond recognition.

272
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,755
Squid are increasingly replacing fish.

273
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,475
We have severely depleted
both their predators and competitors,

274
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,978
so squid are taking over,

275
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:23,569
an indication
of a serious imbalance in the oceans.

276
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:33,371
Squid breed quickly
and have lots of fast-growing young,

277
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:40,086
so they can rapidly exploit the gaps
left by the fish that we have harvested.

278
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,673
They lay their eggs in cases
on the seafloor.

279
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:49,303
The young develop even faster
in these warm, shallow waters.

280
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,726
With such drastic changes
in the marine menu,

281
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,270
predators are having to adapt.

282
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,320
Sea lions prefer to eat
more energy-rich prey,

283
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,489
like anchovies and sardines,

284
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,367
but with these in short supply,

285
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,662
they're forced to rely more
on a diet of squid.

286
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:23,170
We, too, will be forced to change
the seafood we eat

287
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,673
if we continue to fish as we do.

288
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,264
But if we harvest the oceans
in a sustainable way,

289
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,684
they can be marvelously productive

290
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,688
and will provide us
with an abundance of food.

291
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,572
There are already signs
that the ocean has the power

292
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,032
to recover astonishingly quickly.

293
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,377
Humpback whales.

294
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,262
They live in every ocean,

295
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:16,849
traveling the high seas,
from their polar feeding grounds

296
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,893
to the tropics, where they breed.

297
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,567
Yet whales have not always enjoyed
such freedom.

298
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:33,073
Once, there were
more than a hundred thousand humpbacks

299
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,157
in the oceans,

300
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:39,079
but last century,
they were hunted to near extinction.

301
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:48,172
Just a few thousand
survived the onslaught.

302
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,766
A huge public outcry

303
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:04,146
finally led to a ban
on commercial whaling in 1986.

304
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:12,613
Since then, the number of humpback whales
has been steadily increasing.

305
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,497
They're returning
to their ancestral feeding grounds,

306
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,083
like these off the coast of South Africa.

307
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:38,055
They are gathering to take advantage
of a seasonal abundance of krill,

308
00:42:38,138 --> 00:42:40,182
tiny shrimp-like crustaceans.

309
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:55,489
The whales take in
great mouthfuls of water,

310
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,243
trapping the krill
on sieves of hairy bristles

311
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,703
that line their jaws.

312
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,811
Each whale can eat over a ton a day.

313
00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:01,722
With food so plentiful,
fur seals come to claim their share.

314
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:29,833
These extraordinary scenes
were unimaginable just a few years ago.

315
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,311
They form super-groups, hundreds strong.

316
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:17,005
This is the greatest gathering of whales
seen for a century.

317
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:41,572
Whales recycle nutrients
that enrich surface waters,

318
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:44,700
which fuel the growth of phytoplankton,

319
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:50,581
and they, in turn, feed krill
in a perfect self-sustaining cycle.

320
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:57,045
We now know that a healthy community
of great hunters,

321
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:00,174
whales, dolphins, tuna, and sharks,

322
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,094
is essential
for a fully-functioning ocean.

323
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:11,894
And a functioning ocean
is vital to the health of our planet

324
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,771
and humanity.

325
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,527
In a remarkable recovery,

326
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,448
humpback whales have almost returned
to their original numbers.

327
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,495
But during that time,

328
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:34,917
we have done more harm to the oceans
than ever before in human history.

329
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,346
Only with global cooperation

330
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:51,183
will our oceans
recover and thrive once again.

331
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:58,607
We saved the whales
by international agreement.

332
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:05,072
Now, it is time to save our oceans.

333
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:22,798
Please visit ourplanet.com
to discover what we need to do now

334
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:24,883
to protect the high seas.
