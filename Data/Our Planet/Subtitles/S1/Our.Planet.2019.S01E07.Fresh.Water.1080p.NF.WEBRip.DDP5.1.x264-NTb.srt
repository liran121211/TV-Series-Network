2
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,772
Just 50 years ago,

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
we finally ventured to the moon.

4
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,167
For the very first time,

5
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,837
we looked back at our own planet.

6
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:58,683
Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.

7
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,651
This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain

8
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,572
and reveal what we must preserve

9
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,785
to ensure people and nature thrive.

10
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,370
Fresh water.

11
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,959
Everything that lives on land,
animal or plant,

12
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,961
depends upon it.

13
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:13,758
Yet only one percent of it
is within reach.

14
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,530
The desert of central Australia.

15
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:42,162
One of the hottest, driest places
on Earth.

16
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,544
Virtually nothing can live here
for any length of time.

17
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:57,510
Yet once a decade,
this vast, empty desert is transformed.

18
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,101
For that to happen,
a chain reaction has to be triggered

19
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,770
two thousand kilometers to the north.

20
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,490
There, each year,
the moisture-laden clouds of the monsoon

21
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,576
begin to build.

22
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,385
Eventually they burst,
and the process begins.

23
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,526
Riverbeds that have been dry for years
suddenly fill.

24
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,954
The torrents join together
and race towards the interior

25
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,164
and the lowest land on the continent.

26
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:15,880
Here, they flood over the desert
and create Australia's largest lake,

27
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,216
Kati Thanda, Lake Eyre.

28
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:29,060
Huge numbers of fish
swim down these wide waterways

29
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,062
and into the growing lake.

30
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:42,532
Pelicans arrive from Australia's coasts,
hundreds of kilometers away.

31
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:50,707
Many will only see the lake fill
once in their entire lives,

32
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:56,421
so how they know the lake has formed,
and in which direction to reach it,

33
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,880
is still a mystery.

34
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:13,229
These new waters now contain so much food
that the birds start to breed.

35
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,034
But the clock is ticking.

36
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,747
The pelicans feed…

37
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,206
and feed…

38
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,043
and feed.

39
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,548
The chicks must grow quickly,

40
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,177
for they have to be strong enough
to leave within a matter of weeks.

41
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,224
But time is short,

42
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,935
for the parents
will only be able to find food

43
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,562
while the water remains.

44
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,238
The young pelicans set off
on their first long journey.

45
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,162
It will be a demanding one, to the coast,

46
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,082
and the nearest is 500 kilometers away.

47
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,504
The lake will soon dry,

48
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,925
and water may not return here
for another decade.

49
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:34,477
This boom to bust transformation
is an exceptional event.

50
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,901
But everywhere,
the availability of fresh water

51
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:46,114
is becoming increasingly unpredictable
and uncertain.

52
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:04,090
Much of the planet's fresh water,
however, is locked away.

53
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:11,848
Almost two-thirds of it
lies frozen around the poles.

54
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,353
This ice is several kilometers thick

55
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,315
and may have been lying here
for millions of years.

56
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,622
Every summer, some of it melts

57
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,917
and carves its way
into the heart of the glaciers.

58
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,676
These great caves
are beautiful and romantic,

59
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,764
but they're also dangerous places,
for glaciers are always on the move.

60
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,267
Even away from the poles,

61
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,458
much of the land's fresh water
freezes each winter.

62
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:28,049
But when spring arrives,
this vast snowy reservoir melts

63
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,218
and a great journey begins.

64
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,227
Racing down the steep mountain slopes,

65
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,231
the ice-cold waters
collect a life-giving ingredient…

66
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,359
oxygen.

67
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,203
Here, on the rivers of the Andes
in South America,

68
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,205
there is a living to be made

69
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,250
for those that can cope
with the powerful currents.

70
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,336
And torrent ducks can.

71
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,518
These chilly headwaters
may be oxygen-rich,

72
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,895
but they contain few nutrients.

73
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,233
The torrent ducks collect
what little food there is

74
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,235
from below the surface.

75
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,794
Stonefly and mayfly larvae have gills,

76
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,589
with which they extract oxygen
from the water.

77
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,929
Their flattened bodies
resist the relentless pull of the current.

78
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,560
Black fly larvae.

79
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,395
One of the ducks' favorite prey.

80
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,526
Their specialized mouthparts
filter out the tiny particles of food

81
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,694
as they race by.

82
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,991
Hooks at the rear end
anchor them to the rocks,

83
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,994
but the current
is sometimes irresistible.

84
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,130
However, they have a special safety line,
with which they can pull themselves back.

85
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:51,901
Every year, visitors come
to these rushing, oxygen-rich waters.

86
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,737
Salmon.

87
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,619
They have spent most of their lives
in the Pacific Ocean.

88
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:11,629
Now, fully grown, they're returning
to the particular rivers in North America

89
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,256
where they will now lay their eggs.

90
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:22,723
Salmon have an extraordinary ability
to leap up waterfalls,

91
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:29,480
but even they cannot, unaided,
cross the dams that we have built.

92
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:39,573
Today, Pacific salmon number less than
one percent of the numbers they used to,

93
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:43,077
and that's causing problems
for many other animals.

94
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:52,044
Alaskan brown bears
wait for them at the waterfalls.

95
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,845
Without these fish,

96
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:04,265
the bears cannot build up
the fat reserves they need

97
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,893
to sustain themselves
through their long winter hibernation.

98
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,445
There is fierce competition
for the best fishing spots.

99
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:59,862
Where water flows over hard rock,
it collects few nutrients,

100
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,031
so few plants can grow in it.

101
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,243
Here, in South America, however,

102
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,955
this plant, Macarenia,
manages to flourish.

103
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,127
For a few months each year,

104
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,839
when the water level is low enough
for sunlight to reach the bottom,

105
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,175
the Macarenia bursts into bloom.

106
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:31,894
This is the Caño Cristales,
Colombia's rainbow river.

107
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,741
Sometimes, however,
water disappears underground,

108
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,785
beyond the reach of light,

109
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,663
and there, no plants can live.

110
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:58,879
Thirty percent of the planet's fresh water
lies beneath the surface of the land,

111
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,882
either within the substance
of porous rocks

112
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,052
or as subterranean lakes and rivers.

113
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,641
Made slightly acid by rain,

114
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,854
it slowly dissolves limestone,
creating great caves.

115
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:22,695
A labyrinth of such passages and chambers
underlies much of the state of Florida.

116
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,490
For the most part, they're barren.

117
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:33,372
But where the water comes to the surface,
it's full of life.

118
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,251
Fish are abundant.

119
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,176
And so are fish eaters.

120
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,970
Otters.

121
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,529
All over the state,
fresh water bubbles to the surface

122
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,283
from the greatest concentration of springs
on Earth.

123
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:32,181
They feed rivers and pools,
in which all kinds of life flourish,

124
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,893
including one of Florida's specialities…

125
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,520
manatees.

126
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,612
Many spend the summer in the sea,

127
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,407
but when winter approaches,
they swim up the rivers,

128
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,034
which are relatively warm.

129
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,880
And there they graze
on an abundance of freshwater plants.

130
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,264
But human beings are now taking
so much water from these springs,

131
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,058
and polluting many of the others,

132
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,687
that the manatees
are losing their winter homes.

133
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:38,038
Rivers, being comparatively shallow,
warm quickly,

134
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,207
and in spring, across Europe,

135
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,378
the rising temperatures
trigger a sudden surge of life.

136
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:05,149
On Hungary's Tisza River,
giant mayfly are starting to emerge.

137
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,825
For three years,
they've lived underwater as larvae.

138
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,996
Now, in just three hours,

139
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,585
millions of the winged adults
dance together and mate before they die.

140
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,230
This extraordinary spectacle
was once common in Eastern Europe,

141
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,026
but so many rivers
now have stabilized banks

142
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,819
and are badly polluted

143
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,280
that the mayflies
have largely disappeared.

144
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,954
But when the rivers are clean,
wildlife is quick to return.

145
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:27,106
The kingfisher,
the most glorious of divers.

146
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,848
The osprey, the most skillful of graspers.

147
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:43,932
Iguazu, on the frontier
between Brazil and Argentina.

148
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,980
These are
the largest waterfalls on the planet.

149
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,612
Thousands of tons of fresh water
thunder over them every second.

150
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:11,418
Much of Iguazu's water
comes from the Amazon rainforest,

151
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,378
a thousand kilometers away.

152
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,683
There, it rose as vapor
from the surface of the jungle canopy.

153
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:32,314
A single tree can give off
a thousand liters a day.

154
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:39,738
As the vapor rises into the sky,
it condenses into clouds.

155
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,912
Twenty billion tons of water
leave the forest each day,

156
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,082
more than travels
down the Amazon River itself.

157
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,629
If the rainforest is destroyed,

158
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,257
this life-giving cycle will be broken.

159
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,263
As the clouds travel across the continent,
they shed their water,

160
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,015
irrigating farmland and forest alike.

161
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,102
And on the plains of Brazil,

162
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,897
they create
the largest tropical wetland on Earth,

163
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,066
the Pantanal.

164
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,322
Each year, however,
seasonal changes reduce the river's flow,

165
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:26,159
and the Pantanal shrinks
to just a few river channels.

166
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,293
This suits the top predator very well.

167
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,255
The jaguar.

168
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,511
It's a competent swimmer, but in water,

169
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,473
it can't make the killing pounce
which makes it such a fearsome hunter.

170
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,689
Now, in the dry season,

171
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,735
the banks can get somewhat crowded.

172
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,202
But the jaguar has spotted prey
on the river's edge.

173
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,217
Capybara.

174
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,932
It must get close to be successful.

175
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:04,174
Two capybara incautiously
are standing in the shallows.

176
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,270
They have seen one another.

177
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,319
Which will run first?

178
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:52,055
Farther along the river,
dense vegetation provides better cover,

179
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,726
but the bank here is quite high.

180
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,899
Capybara have acute hearing.

181
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,946
One noisy footfall…

182
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,839
…and the chance is lost.
Another failure.

183
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,596
Perhaps it's time to try a different prey.

184
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,563
Tackling one of these would be risky,

185
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,775
but the jaguar is really hungry.

186
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,870
If a jaguar is to catch a caiman,

187
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:43,625
it must bite its neck and then hold on
to prevent the caiman striking back.

188
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:50,507
It has to get into a position
directly above its prey.

189
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,557
This is dangerous.

190
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,583
The caiman rolls
to try and drown the jaguar.

191
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,632
Predator and prey seem evenly matched.

192
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,933
The jaguar won't let go.

193
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:06,750
After 20 minutes, and near to exhaustion,
the jaguar wins.

194
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:21,514
Sometimes, a river's downward journey
is interrupted by lakes.

195
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:28,730
Together, they contain 40 times more water
than all the world's rivers combined.

196
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,235
Africa's Lake Tanganyika

197
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,157
holds almost a fifth
of all accessible fresh water on Earth.

198
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:49,376
But, considering its great size,
Tanganyika contains little life.

199
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,385
It's almost a kilometer and a half deep,

200
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:03,723
but at the bottom the water barely moves
and there is no oxygen.

201
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:11,064
It's only close to the surface,
in its top 150 meters,

202
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,984
that the water contains enough oxygen
for life to exist.

203
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,990
But here, it flourishes in abundance.

204
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:28,289
Two hundred and fifty species
of cichlid fish have evolved here,

205
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,542
many of which are found nowhere else.

206
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,597
Competition in these crowded waters
is intense.

207
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,730
A male callipterus cichlid
collects shells.

208
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,278
The more shells a male has,
the more females he will attract.

209
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,076
And this one is doing very well.

210
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,776
His neighbor has a rather smaller mound.

211
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,992
And the neighbor is a thief.

212
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,833
As soon as he turns his back,

213
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,047
the thief swoops in…

214
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,384
and steals a shell.

215
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:18,650
The hardworking owner of the larger mound
doesn't seem to notice.

216
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:25,073
So, the thief commits the crime again…

217
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,991
and again…

218
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,667
until he has built the largest mound.

219
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,715
The shells are not just for display.

220
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,469
They will be used by the females
as cradles.

221
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,766
One arrives.

222
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,603
She's tiny, only a tenth of his size.

223
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,276
She's so small,
she can slip inside a shell.

224
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:15,331
There, she lays her eggs,
and the male quickly fertilizes them.

225
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:23,423
She will then stay inside protecting them
for up to a fortnight until they hatch.

226
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,346
The emperor,

227
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,057
the largest of all the cichlids
in Tanganyika.

228
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:41,057
At almost a meter long, this female
must raise her young in the open.
Guarding them is therefore
a full-time job for both parents.

229
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:03,630
But the future for all these fish
is uncertain.

230
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:11,387
As global temperatures rise,
Lake Tanganyika is warming.

231
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,726
Its waters are no longer mixing as well
as they once did,

232
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,563
so the top oxygenated layer is reducing.

233
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,493
The Mekong River in Southeast Asia.

234
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:39,207
Four thousand kilometers long
and with the widest falls anywhere.

235
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:47,882
Today, over 60 million people
depend upon it for their livelihood.

236
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:15,076
The monsoon rains create
such a colossal surge of water

237
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,787
that the falls themselves
almost disappear.

238
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,084
The water is loaded with sediment,

239
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,171
collected during the Mekong's long journey
from the Tibetan Plateau.

240
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:35,221
Even before the flood,
the water covers a vast area of land.

241
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,230
These exposed roots are evidence

242
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:47,275
of the great rise in water level
that is to come.

243
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,574
When the main flood does arrive,

244
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,660
the trees are submerged
up to their branches.

245
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:07,295
For a few months, the floodwaters create
the planet's greatest breeding grounds

246
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,713
for freshwater fish.

247
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,721
One species
has a particularly ingenious solution

248
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:20,641
to the problems of living
in shallow, oxygen-poor water.

249
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,147
The Siamese fighting fish.

250
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,073
The male breathes
by gulping air from the surface,

251
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,699
and during the breeding season

252
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,703
he uses that ability
to build a raft of bubbles.

253
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,166
Day after day he labors.

254
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:56,886
A female, waiting nearby,
rises to inspect the raft.

255
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:16,906
They wrap themselves around one another
in a tender embrace.

256
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,628
This union encourages her
to release her eggs.

257
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,093
As they sink downwards,
the male fertilizes them.

258
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,934
Both carefully collect them,

259
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:54,902
and then blow them, one by one,
into the bubble nest.

260
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,868
Oxygen is scarce in these stagnant waters,

261
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,328
but the eggs
will get enough from the bubbles

262
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,788
to allow them to develop.

263
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,335
The climax of the flood is still to come.

264
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,675
Eventually,
so much water surges down the Mekong

265
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:23,389
that the Tonlé Sap Lake expands
to five times its dry-season size.

266
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:30,438
Vast numbers of fish now swim
into these new feeding grounds.

267
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,277
People have harvested this seasonal event
for millennia.

268
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,114
They set nets across half of the river,

269
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,533
leaving the other half free

270
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,453
for the rest of the fish
to swim on and breed.

271
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:55,171
The Mekong, in fact, supports
the largest inland fishery in the world.

272
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:06,015
One-fifth of all the freshwater fish
caught by people worldwide

273
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,643
comes from this one river system.

274
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,064
But the future of the Mekong,

275
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,650
like that of so many other rivers
around the world,

276
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,693
is increasingly at risk.

277
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,157
We have changed the natural flow

278
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,786
of more than two-thirds
of the planet's longest rivers

279
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,998
by, amongst other things,
building dams across them.

280
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:44,136
So now, many rivers across the world
no longer flow.

281
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,897
Here in East Africa, in Ruaha, Tanzania,

282
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,317
these elephants are searching for water.

283
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:08,077
Each needs to drink 200 liters every day,
and there doesn't seem to be any here.

284
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:14,709
But the elephants know that baobab wood
contains a lot of moisture.

285
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:21,215
And in an emergency,
they eat it in great quantities.

286
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,100
Lions also need water.

287
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:41,027
And conveniently for the lions,
water is where their prey will gather.

288
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,868
So both predators and prey
head for the rivers.

289
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,334
Until 30 years ago,

290
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,337
rivers in this part of Africa
never ran dry.

291
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,637
Now, agriculture upstream
is taking great quantities,

292
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:13,351
and during the dry season,
the rivers shrink into isolated pools.

293
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:36,207
Hippos rely on flowing water
to keep themselves cool during the day,

294
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:40,211
but now they have to make do with mud.

295
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,427
As the water level falls still further,
they cram together.

296
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,475
Tempers begin to fray.

297
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:20,709
Each day, the mud pools shrink further,
and the hippos' plight worsens.

298
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,976
Buffalo, in the urgent search for water.

299
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:52,950
The lions are already here
at this water hole.

300
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:07,131
However, the buffalo are driven on
by their desperate need for fresh water.

301
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,314
They need to drink every day.

302
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,081
Every drink is now a risk,

303
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,793
but the buffalo have no choice.

304
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:03,747
As the drought continues,
the buffalo begin to weaken.

305
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,586
The odds are changing,
in the lions' favor.

306
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,187
The elephants have reached their river.

307
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:35,112
Nothing else is here because it's dry.

308
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,878
But elephants can find water
where others can't.

309
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:57,051
They use their trunks to dig holes
in the sand of the riverbed.

310
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,271
The extraordinary sense of smell

311
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,067
that enables them to detect open water
from kilometers away

312
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,404
also helps them
to locate places underground

313
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,282
where it lies closest to the surface.

314
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:29,291
In severe droughts,
the wells they dig can be their lifeline.

315
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:42,471
The hardships of the dry season
have always been part of life

316
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,306
on East Africa's plains,

317
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,850
but as the planet warms,

318
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,604
and we ourselves take so much water
for our own purposes,

319
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,692
the droughts are becoming more frequent
and more severe.

320
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,876
The Platte River,
in Nebraska, North America.

321
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:36,358
Each year, sandhill cranes arrive here
as they travel north across America

322
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:40,446
on one of the last great migrations
made by any animal.

323
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,325
It's one of their crucial staging posts.

324
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:58,547
The river once flooded the prairie
for a mile in all directions.

325
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:06,680
This was a perfect place
for them to feed and rest.

326
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,980
Now, we have dammed the river

327
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,484
and taken so much of its water
for our own use

328
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,404
that there is little space left
for the cranes.

329
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:41,507
But conservationists
now manage the river's flow in such a way

330
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,803
that it still creates the sandbanks
the cranes need.

331
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,984
We are not alone in our need for water,

332
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:12,830
but we have the ability to ensure
the fresh waters of the world do flow,

333
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:19,378
and we alone can determine
how they are shared.

Please visit ourplanet.com
to discover what we need to do now

335
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,728
to ensure fresh water keeps flowing.
