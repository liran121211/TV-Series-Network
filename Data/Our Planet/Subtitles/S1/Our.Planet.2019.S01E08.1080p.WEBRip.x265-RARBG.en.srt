1
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,814
<i>Just 50 years ago,</i>

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>we finally ventured to the moon.</i>

3
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:45,795
<i>For the very first time,
we looked back at our own planet.</i>

4
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:58,683
<i>Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.</i>

5
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,610
<i>This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain</i>

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,280
<i>and reveal what we must preserve</i>

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,910
<i>to ensure people and nature thrive.</i>

8
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,762
<i>Forests.</i>

9
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:42,560
<i>Over half of all the world's trees,
evergreen and deciduous,</i>

10
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,688
<i>stand in these great assemblies.</i>

11
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:59,994
<i>For many of us,
they are places of mystery and darkness.</i>

12
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:15,218
<i>They are key to our climate,
and home to countless unique species.</i>

13
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,143
<i>In the past, we have destroyed them
without hesitation.</i>

14
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:30,316
<i>Yet, forests do have
an astonishing ability to recover.</i>

15
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:57,051
{\an8}<i>This is the southern edge
of the boreal forest,</i>

16
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,516
<i>the forest that dominates the far north.</i>

17
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:11,900
<i>It stretches eastwards across Russia
for thousands of kilometers,</i>

18
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,696
<i>and now, in the middle of winter,
it's largely silent,</i>

19
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,868
<i>seemingly empty of animals of any kind.</i>

20
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:31,961
<i>But this is the home
of an animal so rare it's almost mythical.</i>

21
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,987
<i>A Siberian tiger.</i>

22
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,953
<i>There are less than 600 of them.</i>

23
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:27,767
<i>These are the most intimate
pictures of them in the wild yet taken.</i>

24
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:46,244
<i>A male Siberian tiger patrols a territory
of almost 2,000 square kilometers,</i>

25
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,957
<i>and it has to do so
if it is to find enough prey</i>

26
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,961
<i>to keep itself alive
during the long winter.</i>

27
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:09,517
<i>This is an impoverished land
where food of any kind is scarce.</i>

28
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,648
<i>A pine cone.</i>

29
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:23,072
<i>Pine nuts provide vital energy
during the winter months.</i>

30
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,541
<i>Wild boar depend on these nuts.</i>

31
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,174
<i>For them, it has to be grab and go,</i>

32
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,596
<i>for they themselves are food for a tiger.</i>

33
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:05,406
<i>This game of hide-and-seek
is played out over vast areas of forest,</i>

34
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,952
<i>as all the animals search
for the life-giving stands of pine.</i>

35
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:24,092
<i>Poaching has taken the Siberian tiger
to the brink of extinction,</i>

36
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,680
<i>but, since the 1980s,
their numbers have slowly increased.</i>

37
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,152
<i>These rare glimpses reveal</i>

38
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:50,201
<i>that their future still depends on having
vast areas of forest in which to hunt.</i>

39
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,965
<i>The boreal forest extends
from Russia in the east,</i>

40
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,509
<i>across Europe, to North America.</i>

41
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:12,432
<i>It contains 750 billion trees,</i>

42
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,519
<i>and it stores
over 40 percent of the world's carbon,</i>

43
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:21,649
<i>making it a vital element
in the fight against climate change.</i>

44
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:32,201
<i>During the winter, the days are so short
and the temperature so low,</i>

45
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,121
<i>that growth is at a standstill.</i>

46
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,340
<i>This far north,
the forest can support very few animals</i>

47
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,885
<i>compared to the rain forests
of the tropics.</i>

48
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:57,185
<i>Many are dependent on the supplement
to be found in its rivers.</i>

49
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:14,452
<i>In western Alaska,
both in spring and, as now, in autumn,</i>

50
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,913
<i>salmon, having left the ocean,</i>

51
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:20,625
<i>swim up rivers to reach
their ancestral spawning grounds.</i>

52
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,463
<i>Their journey from the sea into the forest
represents</i>

53
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,675
<i>the greatest transfer of nutrients
from one habitat to another</i>

54
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,802
<i>anywhere on Earth.</i>

55
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,521
<i>The fish are crucial seasonal food</i>

56
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,148
<i>for all the predators
that live in this forest.</i>

57
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:52,573
<i>Bald eagles live here the year round
and nest close to the river.</i>

58
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,846
<i>Young eagles,
still without white heads,</i>

59
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,600
<i>spend their first years
searching for food in the forest.</i>

60
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,854
<i>But, like this four-year-old female,</i>

61
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,400
<i>they're now big enough
to try and claim a place on the river.</i>

62
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:37,785
<i>At first, all she can get
are the scraps left by others.</i>

63
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,667
<i>And she can't get even these
without a fight.</i>

64
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,857
<i>She will have to
look elsewhere.</i>

65
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,656
<i>The boreal forest may be vast,</i>

66
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:20,703
<i>but the places where the salmon spawn
are known to all the predators.</i>

67
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:31,547
<i>As the rivers begin to freeze over,
competition becomes even more intense.</i>

68
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:47,188
<i>This youngster is lucky,
but her success is noticed immediately.</i>

69
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,183
<i>She does have one advantage.</i>

70
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:30,481
<i>Females, even when young,
are larger than the males.</i>

71
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,734
<i>And here, size matters.</i>

72
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,237
<i>As winter advances,</i>

73
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:24,118
<i>young and old have to meet
the challenge of the intense cold.</i>

74
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,457
<i>If she can survive,
she will have gained a place</i>

75
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,878
<i>in one of the greatest
and harshest forests on Earth.</i>

76
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,851
<i>A little further south</i>

77
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,521
<i>stand the last
of the great redwood forests.</i>

78
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:01,739
<i>Not so long ago, these great trees
grew throughout the Pacific Northwest.</i>

79
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,249
<i>Now, only five percent of them remain.</i>

80
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,637
<i>Here, conditions are less harsh.</i>

81
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,933
<i>Winds bring in warm, humid air
from the Pacific Ocean,</i>

82
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,520
<i>so the trees are able to grow
the year round.</i>

83
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,193
<i>Hidden in the vegetation
of the moist forest floor</i>

84
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,987
<i>is a richly populated underworld.</i>

85
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,372
<i>A male rough-skinned newt.</i>

86
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:58,170
<i>Every spring,
he is driven by a mysterious urge</i>

87
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:02,007
<i>to return to the pool
where he hatched as a tadpole.</i>

88
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,972
<i>And he needs to get there quickly.</i>

89
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,520
<i>Because there are
lots of others like him...</i>

90
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,652
<i>with exactly the same idea.</i>

91
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,968
<i>They're all searching for a female,</i>

92
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:52,099
<i>but trekking across hundreds of meters
of old-growth forest is not easy.</i>

93
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,067
<i>There is strong competition.</i>

94
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,414
<i>And the female is anxious to get going.</i>

95
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,422
<i>Once paired, he hangs on,</i>

96
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:27,718
<i>for she may take several hours
to discharge all her eggs.</i>

97
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,770
<i>Other males are only too eager
to displace him if they can.</i>

98
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,658
<i>Competition is so vigorous</i>

99
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,953
<i>that the females
in the center of these writhing balls</i>

100
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,872
<i>have been known to drown for lack of air.</i>

101
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,387
<i>But her first partner maintains his grip.</i>

102
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,600
<i>Within weeks, their tadpoles will hatch.</i>

103
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:24,483
<i>And none too soon, for the forest
is about to change dramatically.</i>

104
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,118
<i>By the end of the summer,
the sun has baked the forest so intensely</i>

105
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,996
<i>that they are as dry as tinder.</i>

106
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,272
<i>Strong winds drive the flames,</i>

107
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:08,694
<i>and temperatures rise
to 700 degrees Celsius.</i>

108
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,671
<i>Its aftermath is seemingly
total destruction.</i>

109
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,814
<i>The wind,
scouring the newly exposed forest floor,</i>

110
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,358
<i>kicks up dust devils of ash.</i>

111
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,667
<i>The ground appears to be devoid of life.</i>

112
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,186
<i>But the forest is far from dead.</i>

113
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,073
<i>Within only a few months,</i>

114
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:22,286
<i>flowers and tree seedlings
will rise from the soil.</i>

115
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:37,801
<i>Many, in fact, would not have germinated
had they not received a baptism of fire.</i>

116
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,989
<i>Light streaming down
through the newly opened canopy</i>

117
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,826
<i>provides the energy
for a surge of new growth.</i>

118
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:19,218
<i>The older, well-established redwoods
have survived,</i>

119
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,638
<i>protected
by their thick, fire-resistant bark.</i>

120
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:34,775
<i>This natural resilience is essential
to the continued health of these forests.</i>

121
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:51,041
<i>Most forests, however,
cannot recover on their own.</i>

122
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,673
<i>Many are helped to recover by animals.</i>

123
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,764
<i>The trees and their inhabitants
are interdependent.</i>

124
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,397
<i>And nowhere
is this dependence more apparent</i>

125
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,108
<i>than in India's Western Ghats.</i>

126
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,653
<i>This globally important habitat</i>

127
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,699
<i>contains a third
of all animal species found in India.</i>

128
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,504
<i>Lion-tailed macaques.</i>

129
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,013
<i>They feed on the fruits
of many kinds of tree,</i>

130
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,683
<i>and, in doing so,
they distribute the seeds,</i>

131
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:52,269
<i>which will emerge unscathed
with their droppings.</i>

132
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,985
<i>But few monkeys travel very far.</i>

133
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,699
<i>If plants are to distribute their seeds
across great distances,</i>

134
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,744
<i>they need another kind of transport.</i>

135
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:22,841
<i>Wings.</i>

136
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:48,784
<i>Great hornbills have wings
that are almost two meters across,</i>

137
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:53,789
<i>and they enable the birds to travel
long distances in search of food.</i>

138
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:01,755
<i>Hornbills feed on the fruit
of 40 or so different kinds of trees,</i>

139
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:05,175
<i>and transport
the indigestible seeds they contain</i>

140
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,552
<i>all over the Western Ghats.</i>

141
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:17,396
<i>So, it's to the trees' advantage
to attract the hornbill's attention.</i>

142
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:36,289
<i>The figs themselves,
although they taste nice,</i>

143
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,542
<i>are not, in fact, very nutritious,</i>

144
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,795
<i>so the hornbills have to eat
great quantities of them.</i>

145
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,010
<i>It can be tiring work.</i>

146
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,182
<i>But it's not a free-for-all.</i>

147
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,733
<i>A single fig tree in fruit
attracts great numbers of hornbills.</i>

148
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,786
<i>Competition between them is intense.</i>

149
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:36,850
<i>This aerial jousting between males
has never been filmed before</i>

150
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,145
<i>and its purpose is not really understood.</i>

151
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,525
<i>It may be that the birds
are simply squabbling over food,</i>

152
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,778
<i>but it seems rather more than that.</i>

153
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,982
<i>The winner is able to
demonstrate his strength and skill</i>

154
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,859
<i>to visiting females.</i>

155
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,456
<i>The males certainly seem keen
to ingratiate themselves.</i>

156
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,844
<i>It's particularly important for hornbills
to get the best pairing</i>

157
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:59,015
<i>because, once established,
the bond between male and female</i>

158
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,309
<i>will last a lifetime.</i>

159
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,653
<i>The forest also benefits
from these squabbles,</i>

160
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,406
<i>because even a defeated hornbill</i>

161
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:18,660
<i>will spread seeds over wide areas
as he searches for his next meal.</i>

162
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:28,545
<i>The relationship
between trees and animals in a forest</i>

163
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,755
<i>is not always so harmonious.</i>

164
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,554
<i>This is Africa's largest forest,
the Miombo,</i>

165
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,432
<i>named after one of its common trees.</i>

166
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,520
<i>It stretches for over a thousand miles,</i>

167
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,982
<i>from Angola in the west
to Mozambique in the east.</i>

168
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,910
<i>At the height of the dry season,</i>

169
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:04,998
<i>the Miombo attracts animals
from all across southern Africa.</i>

170
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:22,307
<i>Elephants prefer grass
if they can get it. It's very nutritious.</i>

171
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,687
<i>In its absence,</i>

172
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:32,108
<i>they browse on the abundant leaves
and branches of the Miombo.</i>

173
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,494
<i>But they're not the only
hungry ones here.</i>

174
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,417
<i>These mopane worms</i>

175
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,295
<i>are not worms, of course,
but caterpillars.</i>

176
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,969
<i>They hatch simultaneously in huge numbers.</i>

177
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,269
<i>And just as the forest
is putting out new leaves,</i>

178
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,813
<i>they begin their attack.</i>

179
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,121
<i>They feed so voraciously</i>

180
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:31,376
<i>that in just six weeks
they increase their size 40 times.</i>

181
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:40,051
<i>By the time they're fully developed,
this million-strong army</i>

182
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:43,596
<i>will have stripped the entire forest
of its foliage.</i>

183
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,731
<i>But the Miombo bounces back.</i>

184
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,401
<i>With the caterpillars gone,</i>

185
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,946
<i>the trees produce
a second growth of leaves.</i>

186
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,831
<i>This fresh feast then attracts elephants.</i>

187
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,380
<i>They are less fussy than the caterpillars.</i>

188
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,468
<i>They will eat every part of the tree.</i>

189
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:28,933
<i>And a hungry elephant can munch through
200 kilos of vegetation in a day.</i>

190
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,736
<i>Yet, even this destruction
has its benefits.</i>

191
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:46,493
<i>It shapes the forest in a way that helps
one of Africa's most endangered animals.</i>

192
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,581
<i>Hunting dogs.</i>

193
00:29:56,085 --> 00:30:00,131
<i>They're seen most frequently,
and most easily, on grasslands.</i>

194
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,844
<i>But, in fact, these open forests
are their preferred habitat.</i>

195
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,478
<i>Browsing elephants
open up a forest,</i>

196
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,106
<i>and that attracts the animals
on which the dogs prey.</i>

197
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:03,319
<i>For the dogs, the Miombo forest
is perfect hunting country.</i>

198
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:11,578
<i>And it's also an excellent place
in which to bring up pups.</i>

199
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,716
<i>The pups greet the adults
returning from a hunt</i>

200
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,217
<i>with great excitement.</i>

201
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,309
<i>Food.</i>

202
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,657
<i>The first three months of the pups' lives
are spent sheltering underground.</i>

203
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:57,332
<i>Now, they are confident enough</i>

204
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,834
<i>to stay out in the open
for much of the time.</i>

205
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:05,131
<i>And then, like all puppies, they have fun.</i>

206
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,359
<i>Playing is important for the youngsters,</i>

207
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:28,363
<i>for as they do so,
they establish the social bonds</i>

208
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,908
<i>that they will need when they start
to hunt together as a team.</i>

209
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,923
<i>The Miombo has always been
important for hunting dogs,</i>

210
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,594
<i>both as a place to find prey
and as a refuge.</i>

211
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:58,476
<i>Never has it been more crucial</i>

212
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:02,647
<i>for the survival
of this endangered species than now.</i>

213
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:10,697
<i>But they will only survive
if other creatures are here</i>

214
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,741
<i>to create the kind of habitat they need.</i>

215
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,835
<i>Madagascar has a forest</i>

216
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:27,839
<i>dominated uniquely
by one of the oddest of trees.</i>

217
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,800
<i>Baobabs.</i>

218
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,643
<i>The island has been isolated
for over 80 million years.</i>

219
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:45,356
<i>During that immensity of time,
its animals and plants</i>

220
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,652
<i>have evolved into forms
quite different from any elsewhere.</i>

221
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:58,161
<i>This makes them one of
the most precious forests on our planet.</i>

222
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:13,301
<i>This is not a monkey,
but a distant relative, a lemur,</i>

223
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,888
<i>and there are
at least 40 different kinds of lemurs,</i>

224
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,975
<i>all unique to Madagascar
and all endangered.</i>

225
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,396
<i>Lemurs are crucial
to the forest.</i>

226
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,234
<i>Without them,
some species of tree cannot survive.</i>

227
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:40,286
<i>The forest even has
its own specialized lemur hunter.</i>

228
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,298
<i>It's Madagascar's top predator,</i>

229
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,427
<i>and its presence is cause for alarm.</i>

230
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,851
<i>It can grow
to a length of one and a half meters,</i>

231
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,563
<i>and it's very seldom seen in the wild.</i>

232
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,691
<i>It's a fossa.</i>

233
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,203
<i>For most of the year, fossas are solitary,</i>

234
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:27,125
<i>but in the breeding season, they assemble
in a way that is all their own.</i>

235
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:35,216
<i>Each mature female takes up residence
in a special mating tree.</i>

236
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,442
<i>Half a dozen or so male fossas
have gathered in the forest below it,</i>

237
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,781
<i>but she is clearly occupied.</i>

238
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,495
<i>So, one of the males leaves his scent.</i>

239
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,792
<i>A visiting card,
just to show that he called.</i>

240
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:28,269
<i>He will just have to wait around
and see whether she takes any notice.</i>

241
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:37,153
<i>Her present engagement can last all night.</i>

242
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,829
<i>With its top predators distracted,
the rest of the forest animals</i>

243
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:50,791
<i>can go about their normal nightly business
undisturbed.</i>

244
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:58,758
<i>These are immature leaf bugs,
a species found only here in Madagascar.</i>

245
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:04,764
<i>Why they have this extraordinary shape,
no one knows.</i>

246
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,978
<i>They feed on tree sap,</i>

247
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:15,191
<i>absorbing the part they need
and excreting the rest as a sweet liquid</i>

248
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:19,570
<i>sometimes known, perhaps flatteringly,
as honeydew.</i>

249
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:31,707
<i>And honeydew, in turn, provides food
for a particular species of small lemur.</i>

250
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,390
<i>The gray mouse lemur
is only 15 centimeters long,</i>

251
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,476
<i>one of the smallest primates in the world.</i>

252
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,943
<i>It's very active
and needs an energy-packed food.</i>

253
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,739
<i>And while the sugar drops
are clearly delicious,</i>

254
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,700
<i>they're not very sustaining.</i>

255
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,833
<i>So, she's not going to let
a single drop go to waste.</i>

256
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:42,361
<i>The male fossas below
are still awaiting their turn.</i>

257
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:47,783
<i>So, having eaten
as much as she can,</i>

258
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,203
<i>she retreats
to the safety of her nest hole</i>

259
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,748
<i>to sleep during the daylight hours.</i>

260
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,357
<i>Things are not looking so satisfactory
on the ground</i>

261
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:21,359
<i>around the fossas' mating tree.</i>

262
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,784
<i>The pair above
are clearly still engaged.</i>

263
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:38,417
<i>He will either have to find
another mating tree or be very patient.</i>

264
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,803
<i>But he may well fail altogether.</i>

265
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:56,435
<i>A third of Madagascar's fossas
have disappeared in the last 20 years,</i>

266
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,982
<i>a result of the continued destruction
of their forests by people.</i>

267
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,239
<i>Since these pictures were recorded,</i>

268
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:11,700
<i>this forest,
and the unique life it once contained,</i>

269
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,203
<i>have disappeared altogether.</i>

270
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:24,296
<i>Only three percent
of Madagascar's dry forest remains.</i>

271
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:34,181
<i>Worldwide, we have now destroyed</i>

272
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:38,144
<i>over half of the forests
that once flourished on our planet.</i>

273
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,733
<i>Not only are we losing the animals
that once lived in them,</i>

274
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:49,029
<i>we are also changing the climate
of the entire globe.</i>

275
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,004
<i>But our planet's forests,
if given the chance,</i>

276
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,965
<i>are almost unbelievably resilient.</i>

277
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,724
<i>Perhaps the best proof we have
of their ability to recover</i>

278
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:21,020
<i>can be seen on the site
of one of our greatest disasters.</i>

279
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,237
<i>Chernobyl.</i>

280
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:42,708
<i>In 1986, one of the four reactors
at the Chernobyl nuclear plant exploded.</i>

281
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:49,215
<i>It turned this utopian vision
of the future into a ghost town.</i>

282
00:41:55,721 --> 00:42:00,100
<i>Over 100,000 people
were immediately evacuated,</i>

283
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,477
<i>never to return.</i>

284
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:14,657
<i>The fallout zone was declared
uninhabitable for the next 20,000 years.</i>

285
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:29,755
<i>Yet despite the radiation,
there has been a remarkable recovery.</i>

286
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,576
<i>Within only a decade,</i>

287
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,538
<i>vegetation began to germinate
in the ruined city.</i>

288
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:14,800
<i>And as the forest reestablished itself,
animals began to appear.</i>

289
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,787
<i>At first it was thought
that these were rare visitors,</i>

290
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,545
<i>but it soon became clear
that the former city</i>

291
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:56,175
<i>was occupied by an established
and thriving wild community.</i>

292
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,496
<i>Within only 20 years,</i>

293
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:28,415
<i>science has recorded
populations of animals</i>

294
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,585
<i>similar to that
in the wilder parts of Europe.</i>

295
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:40,302
<i>Roe deer are now a common sight,
wandering through the suburbs.</i>

296
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,522
<i>Herds of the endangered Przewalski's horse</i>

297
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,566
<i>now roam freely
through the once busy city.</i>

298
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,405
<i>Most surprising of all perhaps,</i>

299
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,409
<i>the top predator of these forests
has reappeared.</i>

300
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,246
<i>Wolves.</i>

301
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,752
<i>Hunters like these would only return</i>

302
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:18,006
<i>if their prey and the surrounding forest
is also thriving.</i>

303
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,136
<i>Now, studies have shown</i>

304
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:27,975
<i>that there are seven times more wolves
inside the exclusion zone than outside it.</i>

305
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,569
<i>No unprotected human being</i>

306
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,864
<i>can stay here for long
without lethal risk.</i>

307
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,160
<i>But in driving us out,</i>

308
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,956
<i>the radiation has created space
for wildlife to return.</i>

309
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:05,262
<i>The dramatic recolonization of Chernobyl
in the space of only 30 years</i>

310
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:09,767
<i>is proof
of forests' extraordinary resilience.</i>

311
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,073
<i>If we choose to give forests
time and space,</i>

312
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,534
<i>they could reclothe the earth</i>

313
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,663
<i>with much of the rich and varied
communities of animals and plants</i>

314
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,250
<i>of which we have, so recently, robbed it.</i>

315
