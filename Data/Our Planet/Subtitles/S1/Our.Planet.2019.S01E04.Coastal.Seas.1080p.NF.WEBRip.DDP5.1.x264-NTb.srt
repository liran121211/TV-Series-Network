2
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,772
Just 50 years ago,

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
we finally ventured to the moon.

4
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,837
For the very first time,
we looked back at our own planet.

5
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:58,683
Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,651
This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain

7
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,280
and reveal what we must preserve

8
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,785
to ensure people and nature thrive.

9
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:36,346
Immense shoals of fish
throng our shallow seas.

10
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,558
These are anchovies.

11
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,611
Small fish, in turn, sustain bigger ones.

12
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,913
Hunters, such as giant trevally…

13
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,463
and mobula rays.

14
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:20,056
When hunters such as these work together,
they become extremely efficient.

15
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:07,353
The rich coastal seas
are the fishing grounds of our planet

16
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:13,276
and can provide an abundance of food
for wildlife and humanity.

17
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:33,087
The seas fringing land make up
less than a tenth of the world's oceans,

18
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:39,469
yet, astonishingly,
90 percent of all marine creatures

19
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,055
live in these coastal waters.

20
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:51,105
This superabundance
is due to the fact that the seafloor here

21
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,358
is within reach of sunlight.

22
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,244
Everglades National Park
in southern Florida.

23
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,042
Fields of seagrass
carpet the shallow tropical waters.

24
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,635
Like savannas on land,

25
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:26,015
these lush marine meadows
support a great variety of animal life.

26
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,486
Stingrays search for prey
hiding in the seagrass.

27
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:58,199
The Everglades
are also the hunting grounds
of the coasts' most ingenious fishermen.

28
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,059
Bottlenose dolphins.

29
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:20,153
They search for food using echolocation,
a type of sonar.

30
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,925
Ahead of them, a shoal of mullet.

31
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,564
These particular dolphins

32
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:00,151
have developed their own special way
of catching their prey.

33
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,536
They carefully herd the fish
into just the right place.

34
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:19,754
Then one dolphin stirs up a ring of mud
that encircles the shoal.

35
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,221
The fish panic and take to the air.

36
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,061
Most escape.

37
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,774
Catching flying fish isn't easy.

38
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,451
But the dolphins move on
and take another helping.

39
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,273
People aren't allowed to fish commercially
within the national park,

40
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,527
so there's plenty for the dolphins.

41
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,671
Only from the air can we really appreciate
the industry of these master fishermen.

42
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:59,645
The shallow seas are vitally important
in the fight against climate change.

43
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:07,278
Seagrass absorb
35 times as much carbon dioxide

44
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,697
as the same area of rainforest,

45
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:15,578
and that reduces the damage
caused by the recent warming of our seas.

46
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,835
Mangroves often border
the seagrass meadows.

47
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,799
These remarkable trees
are the only ones that can cope

48
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,011
with the varying saltiness
of coastal waters.

49
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,853
They not only protect our coasts
from the destructive forces of hurricanes

50
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,733
but also, like seagrass,
capture carbon dioxide.

51
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:58,120
Their tangled roots
create safe nurseries for young fish,

52
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,873
which will eventually leave the mangroves

53
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,711
and make their homes in the tropical seas'
most magical wonderlands,

54
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,464
coral reefs.

55
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:18,140
These reefs cover
less than one percent of the seafloor,

56
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,353
yet they are home
to a quarter of all marine species.

57
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,573
None of these creatures would be here
were it not for the coral.

58
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,797
Corals create the structures
that provide food and shelter,

59
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,633
on which the entire community depends.

60
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,603
Every resident has a role to play
in maintaining the health of the reef.

61
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,737
Unfortunately, few reefs
are as pristine as they once were,

62
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,658
and most are now missing

63
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,078
one extremely important member
of the community.

64
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,831
Sharks.

65
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:34,216
Relentless overfishing has reduced
shark populations around the world

66
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,218
by over 90 percent.

67
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,976
Today they only thrive
in anything like their former numbers

68
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,479
on the very remotest of reefs.

69
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,321
French Polynesia,
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

70
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,201
Here, at least,
sharks are fully protected.

71
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,086
By day, gray reef sharks
hang in the current.

72
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,969
They let little wrasse
pick their teeth clean

73
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,722
in readiness for the night's hunt ahead.

74
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,279
These sharks prefer to hunt in darkness,

75
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,909
when their acute senses
give them an advantage over their prey.

76
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,832
Nightfall.

77
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:59,051
Time for small fish to take refuge
within the nooks and crannies of the reef,

78
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,764
beyond the reach of the gray reef sharks.

79
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,491
The sharks can detect
the slightest movement.

80
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,847
Breaking cover is dangerous.

81
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,419
Stay motionless
and the sharks may not detect you.

82
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,779
A little fish may outmaneuver
a single shark,

83
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:48,202
but with so many hunters
there is little chance of escape.

84
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,757
Sheltering within the coral branches
is usually the safest option,

85
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,514
but the arrival of a second hunter
changes everything.

86
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,185
Whitetip reef sharks.

87
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,237
Slender and more agile,

88
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,783
the whitetips can get into hiding places
other hunters can't reach.

89
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,250
Those that are not caught by the whitetips

90
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,753
are flushed out
to the waiting gray reef sharks.

91
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,389
With both kinds of sharks
hunting in partnership,

92
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,726
there is little respite,
even within the reef.

93
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:18,792
More and more sharks arrive,
attracted by the commotion.

94
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:04,380
Such numbers of sharks were once common
on reefs around the world.

95
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,552
And while so many predators
may seem damaging,

96
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:16,225
sharks, in fact, assist
in maintaining the health of the reef.

97
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,773
They help to keep a balance
in the fish community

98
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,778
by hunting the predators
that feed on small grazing fish.

99
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,621
The grazers, in their turn,

100
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,666
keep the corals
free of seaweeds and parasites

101
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,335
that would otherwise overgrow the reef.

102
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,718
A balanced community,
with sharks as top predators,

103
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:56,390
gives a coral reef much greater resilience
in the face of damage and disaster.

104
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,857
But today, even healthy coral reefs
are facing a greater threat.

105
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,866
With climate change, our seas are warming.

106
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,623
Microscopic plants
that live within the tissues of the corals

107
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,419
give them both their color
and most of their nourishment.

108
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,510
But if seas temperatures rise
by just a degree or two,

109
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,674
the corals expel their plant partners.
So they lose their main source of food…

110
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,444
and turn white.

111
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,911
Here, on Australia's Great Barrier Reef,
unusually warm seas

112
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,331
have caused many of the reefs
to bleach in this way.

113
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,255
It may look hauntingly beautiful,

114
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,842
but if temperatures remain high
for a few weeks,

115
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,347
the corals will starve
and eventually die.

116
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,104
The carbon dioxide
that causes global warming

117
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,065
is also making the seas more acidic.

118
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,944
No reefs can survive both changes.

119
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,366
And without living corals,

120
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,078
many of the reef's residents
will also perish.

121
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,839
During 2016 and 2017,

122
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:56,260
over a thousand kilometers
of the Great Barrier Reef bleached.

123
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,810
Six months later,

124
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,688
and many of the corals are dead.

125
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,401
The community destroyed.

126
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:26,081
Worldwide, half of all shallow coral reefs
have already died.

127
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,590
The rest could be gone
over the next few decades.

128
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,103
Away from the tropics,
in higher latitudes,

129
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,105
the seas are much cooler.

130
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:57,070
Storm-lashed waters bring essential
nutrients to the surface.

131
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:02,117
The enriched water,
combined with long summer days,

132
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,871
make these
the most productive seas on the planet.

133
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,885
Fur seals thrive
and even have time to ride the waves.

134
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,790
Spring off the coast of California

135
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,795
and fronds of golden kelp
floating on the surface

136
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,256
hint at the riches hidden beneath.

137
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,436
A magnificent submarine forest.

138
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:22,489
These stands of giant kelp
are as important to the oceans

139
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,449
as trees are to the land.

140
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,541
Like a rainforest,

141
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:37,671
the dense canopy provides food and shelter
for an abundant community.

142
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,934
In the cool, rich seas,
giant kelp can grow 50 meters high.

143
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:59,359
Air-filled floats lift the fronds
towards the sunlit surface.

144
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,413
Nestling in this canopy,

145
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,583
a sea otter.

146
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,755
His thick fur keeps him warm
in the chilly water.

147
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,308
Blowing air into it
gives him extra insulation.

148
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,280
Sea otters
have the densest fur of any animal,

149
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,410
and such a luxuriant coat
requires a great deal of attention.

150
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,901
They need to eat a lot to keep warm

151
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,488
and consume up to a quarter
of their body weight every day.

152
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,705
Sea urchins are a favorite food.

153
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,298
There's one.

154
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:48,927
And a second.

155
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,393
And then the otter is out of breath
and must return to the surface.

156
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,280
An urchin
looks like a rather prickly meal,

157
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,367
but if you can break the shell,
there's a feast inside.

158
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:26,715
Sea otters are crucial
to the health of the kelp forest

159
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,011
because they keep down
the number of sea urchins.

160
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,030
The urchins graze on kelp,

161
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,910
munching through their tough stems.

162
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:07,464
Left unchecked, they spread
across the seafloor like a plague.

163
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:15,347
Fortunately, the otters have a helper
in the fight against these spiny grazers.

164
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,730
Sheephead wrasse.

165
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,568
They have powerful teeth

166
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:33,198
and can make short work
of the smaller purple urchins.

167
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,017
The larger black urchins
are more of a challenge,

168
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,146
especially for smaller wrasse.

169
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,529
Only the very largest sheephead
can tackle them.

170
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:29,129
But it still has to get past
those long spines.

171
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:39,097
The urchin has to be flipped over
to expose its vulnerable underside.

172
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,313
Not easy when you have no hands.

173
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,115
Success at last.

174
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,621
And everybody benefits.

175
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:20,639
These fish and otters,
living within marine protected areas,

176
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,183
keep the kelp grazers under control.

177
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:34,736
But just outside these sanctuaries,
the urchins graze unchecked…

178
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,909
and fell the kelp forest.

179
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,751
All those that depend on the kelp
have disappeared.

180
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:03,139
In California, kelp forests
grow abundantly in protected areas

181
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:08,978
where the whole marine community
can live without pressure from people.

182
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:25,704
Here, at least, sea otters
can chill out Californian style.

183
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,560
Three thousand kilometers further north,
in Alaska,

184
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,604
spring arrives much later in the year.

185
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,195
After a cold, hard winter,

186
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,575
the first rays of the sun
trigger a great annual event.

187
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:15,086
Immense shoals of herring
rise up from the depths

188
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,380
and move into shallower waters.

189
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,177
They're gathering to breed.

190
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,641
But predators are waiting for them.

191
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,612
Steller's sea lions.

192
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,918
So intent on their mission,
the herring make easy prey.

193
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:16,940
Sea lions drive the fish to the surface,
within range of aerial hunters.

194
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:28,535
Bald eagles, normally solitary birds,
have assembled in numbers for the feast.

195
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,586
In places, the herrings reach shore,

196
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,509
and there the eagles
don't even need to take to the air.

197
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,582
Humpback whales.

198
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,632
They have come
all the way from the tropics,

199
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,260
hoping to get their first meal in months.

200
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:51,200
These whales have a remarkable way
of collecting this seasonal bounty.

201
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,430
They work as a team.

202
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,516
The lead whale dives first…

203
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:21,397
and blows a curtain of bubbles
to concentrate the fish.

204
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,411
A call synchronizes the attack.

205
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,089
By cooperating in this way,
each whale can eat a ton of fish a day.

206
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,928
Yet the herring are so abundant

207
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:39,058
that, in spite of the whales,
most managed to reach the shallows.

208
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,354
And here they spawn.

209
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,282
The females lay their eggs
on the seagrass.

210
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:03,916
The males follow,
fertilizing the eggs with clouds of sperm.

211
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:16,095
Once, herring thrived here in an abundance
we can barely imagine today.

212
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,066
They used to turn shorelines white
with spawn,

213
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,987
right across the North Pacific
from Japan to California.

214
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,162
With industrialized fishing techniques

215
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,583
it's all too easy
to overexploit these breeding stocks.

216
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:57,470
This is one of the few places
where a fishery still survives.

217
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,857
Pacific herring populations
are greatly reduced.

218
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,443
A mere fraction of what they once were.

219
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,833
This sorry tale of unsustainable fishing

220
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:31,003
has been repeated time and again
around the world.

221
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:39,637
Many of the world's fish stocks
are now in serious decline.

222
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,475
A third of them have collapsed altogether.

223
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,243
In coastal seas,

224
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:07,707
jellyfish are taking over waters
that were once dominated by fish.

225
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,762
Compass jellyfish have an ethereal beauty,

226
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:27,393
but they provide very little sustenance
for other wildlife or us.

227
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,876
These immense swarms
are becoming increasingly common.

228
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:57,298
A worrying sign of a serious imbalance
in our shallow seas.

229
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:14,148
Unless we start to fish sustainably,
our seas, once so bountiful,

230
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:22,073
will be filled with little more
than vast swarms… of jellyfish.

231
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:42,218
But the future
does not have to be like this.

232
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:58,359
On the Pacific coast of South America,
we can see how the oceans can recover.

233
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,867
The Atacama, the world's driest desert.

234
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:12,081
Inland it's barely able
to sustain life of any kind,

235
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,463
and yet the coast
could not be more different.

236
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:31,600
For centuries, seabirds have gathered
in millions on these desert shores.

237
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:41,277
But 50 years ago
the great colonies disappeared

238
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,322
because we overfished the local waters.

239
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,871
Controls were introduced,
and now the fish stocks are recovering.

240
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:59,128
So today, three million guanay cormorants
assemble each year to raise their young.

241
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,685
Each morning the birds head out to sea.

242
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:39,752
The colonies are so vast
they take over an hour to empty.

243
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,646
Joining the procession, Inca terns.

244
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,531
Peruvian boobies.

245
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,628
A great caravan of hunters,
all searching for the same thing.

246
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,266
Anchovies.

247
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,528
These little fish are so abundant

248
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:51,323
that they support
the greatest fishery on our planet.

249
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,959
Astonishingly, they can account
for a tenth of all the fish

250
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,087
we harvest from our oceans every year.

251
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,560
Sea lions are first to find the shoals.

252
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:44,460
As fish are driven to the surface,
they come within range of pelicans.

253
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,990
Cormorants dive to grab their share.

254
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,504
Boobies strike from heights of 20 meters.

255
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,103
They hit the water
at a hundred kilometers an hour.

256
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:29,481
Today, the lives of five million
cormorants and boobies

257
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,900
depend on the great shoals.

258
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,076
Yet, if we allow the anchovies
to fully recover,

259
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,914
they could sustain
the 25 million seabirds they once did.

260
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,256
It is a vivid reminder

261
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,385
of the astonishing riches
our coastal seas can support.

262
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,900
And, when given the chance,
they can recover surprisingly quickly.

263
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:21,742
The islands of Raja Ampat
in Southeast Asia.

264
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:28,290
These seas were largely stripped
of sharks and other large fish

265
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,043
by years of unregulated fishing.

266
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:40,094
This lagoon was once occupied
by a shark fishing camp.

267
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,603
Now it's a nursery for baby sharks.

268
00:44:56,026 --> 00:45:00,739
The seas around Misool
were fully protected in 2007,

269
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,992
and the recovery has been miraculous.

270
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:11,041
Today there are 25 times more sharks
than a decade ago.

271
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:20,384
Turtles that used to be hunted
now peacefully graze on the seagrass.

272
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,649
Sharks are returning to local reefs,

273
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,236
helping to restore the balanced community,

274
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,824
giving them a greater resilience
against the effects of coral bleaching.

275
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,472
Ocean-going manta rays.

276
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,819
Seven meters from wing tip to wing tip.

277
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,329
These endangered giants

278
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,665
spend most of their lives
roaming the high seas.

279
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,880
But now they are returning
to this sanctuary

280
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,716
to seek the attention of cleaner wrasse.

281
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:57,689
Misool is one of the few places on Earth
where biodiversity is actually increasing.

282
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,448
Since protection,
there are three times more fish

283
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,200
than just ten years ago.

284
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,341
Fishermen working nearby waters
profit from the overspill.

285
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,846
They now catch more fish for less effort.

286
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:45,237
We have far too few marine sanctuaries,

287
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:49,449
and in many
commercial fishing is still allowed.

288
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:58,250
We need to turn
a third of all our coastal seas

289
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,836
into properly protected areas.

290
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,723
If we do that,
our planet's fishing grounds would recover

291
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:18,604
and help sustain both humanity
and the rest of the natural world.
