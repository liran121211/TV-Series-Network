2
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,896
Just 50 years ago,

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,400
we finally ventured to the moon.

4
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:44,878
For the very first time,
we look back at our own planet.

5
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:57,766
Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.

6
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:07,817
This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain,

7
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,362
and reveal what we must preserve

8
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,992
to ensure people and nature thrive.

9
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,264
When human beings
built their first settlements

10
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,475
some 10,000 years ago,

11
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,519
the world around them,

12
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,522
on the land and in the sea,

13
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,148
was full of life.

14
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:11,339
For generations, this stable Eden
nurtured our growing civilizations.

15
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,265
But now, in the space
of just one human lifetime,

16
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,767
all that has changed.

17
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,939
In the last 50 years,

18
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,944
wildlife populations have, on average,
declined by 60 percent.

19
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,658
For the first time in human history,

20
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:43,496
the stability of nature
can no longer be taken for granted.

21
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,969
But the natural world is resilient.

22
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,598
Great riches still remain.

23
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,983
And with our help, the planet can recover.

24
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:21,993
Never has it been more important
to understand how the natural world works,

25
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,078
and how to help it.

26
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,230
Wildlife still flourishes
in astonishing numbers

27
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:53,107
in a few precious places.

28
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,908
Along the Peruvian coast of South America,

29
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:07,038
seabirds congregate
in colonies millions strong.

30
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,503
They come here to breed.

31
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,808
Every morning,
the birds leave their colonies

32
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,062
to fish in one of the richest seas
on Earth.

33
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,200
It is an astonishing daily migration

34
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,287
of five million birds.

35
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:58,131
The huge flocks of cormorants and boobies
are all seeking one thing:

36
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,634
anchovies.

37
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,943
The boobies carpet-bomb the shoals.

38
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:31,539
More and more birds
join the feeding frenzy.

39
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,750
All in this immense assembly are here

40
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,962
because a powerful oceanic current,
the Humboldt,

41
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,090
sweeps up from the Antarctic,

42
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,761
bringing with it rich nutrients
from the ocean's depths.

43
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,311
90 percent of the life in the oceans

44
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,731
is found in the shallow seas
close to the coast.

45
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,821
Away from the land,

46
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,908
the seas, for the most part,
are a blue desert.

47
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,830
But even these distant waters
may be enriched

48
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,667
by a most unexpected connection
to the land.

49
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,424
Some deserts,

50
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,135
often hundreds of kilometers
from the ocean,

51
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,264
provide the raw materials for life.

52
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:28,573
Every year, winds sweep up
two billion tons of dust into the sky.

53
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:35,580
At least a quarter of it
eventually falls on the sea,

54
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,751
providing nutrients
needed by the microscopic organisms

55
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,422
that are the foundations of ocean life.

56
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:58,019
Dolphins explore the vast, open ocean

57
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,065
in search of the riches
that distant deserts may have nourished.

58
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:16,579
A shoal of mackerel
has discovered a swarm of krill...

59
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,124
the small crustaceans

60
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,544
that feed on the ocean's
floating microscopic plants.

61
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,966
But the mackerel themselves
are food for the dolphins.

62
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,152
They drive the mackerel
towards the surface,

63
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:51,197
and into the range of birds.

64
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,034
Shearwaters.

65
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,747
The wings that normally propel the birds
through the air

66
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,209
now drive them six meters down
through the water.

67
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,219
Whilst the birds
pick off the top of the shoal...

68
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,684
the dolphins attack the underside.

69
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,263
After 20 minutes of feasting,

70
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,975
the predators
from both the sea and the air

71
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,269
have had their fill.

72
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,831
The stability of life on our planet

73
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:28,419
relies on such connections
between different habitats.

74
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,717
Water evaporating
from the surface of the sea

75
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,137
condenses to form great clouds.

76
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:46,687
And these eventually
release the fresh water as rain.

77
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:56,530
But these life-giving rains
are not evenly spread over the land.

78
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,749
This vast salt pan in Africa

79
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,503
is all that remains of an ancient lake.

80
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,551
It's totally waterless and oven-hot.

81
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,264
Few places on the land
are more hostile to life.

82
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:35,277
A few tracks cross it, made by animals
searching unsuccessfully for water.

83
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:01,595
But very occasionally,
this whole landscape is transformed.

84
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,326
A huge deluge drenches the salt pan.

85
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,845
Triggered by some unknown signal,

86
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:48,726
flocks of lesser flamingos
arrive from thousands of kilometers away.

87
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,239
The algae that the flamingos feed on

88
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,868
have lain dormant as spores in the dust.

89
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,500
But most importantly,

90
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,503
the birds are here to breed.

91
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:22,760
Perfect conditions might occur
only once in a decade.

92
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,102
The birds nest on an island
far from the shore.

93
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,025
They build mounds of mud
that raise up their eggs

94
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:43,030
and so keep them just marginally cooler
than they would be at ground level.

95
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,204
The water surrounding the island
is so salty

96
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,790
that predators do not venture into it.

97
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,835
So the nests are safe.

98
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:05,177
Thirty days later,
thousands of chicks start to hatch.

99
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,570
But there is no shelter
from the scorching sun.

100
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,159
The water that once surrounded
their island, protecting them,

101
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,245
has now dried up altogether.

102
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:43,799
The last to hatch
step out into a desperately harsh world.

103
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:02,568
Somehow or other, the growing chicks
must find fresh water to drink.

104
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:12,411
They cannot yet fly, so they must walk,
guided by some of the adults.

105
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,012
They may have to trek for 50 kilometers.

106
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,963
Some... cannot keep up.

107
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,888
The salt has solidified around their legs.

108
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,094
Most of the chicks,
in spite of everything,

109
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,263
and having walked for days,

110
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,724
eventually reach fresh water.

111
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,538
It is the end of a long journey...

112
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:26,295
but only the first of the trials
that will be imposed on these flamingos

113
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,048
by the irregularity of the rains.

114
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:42,436
If rainfall is more predictable
and certain,

115
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,189
then life can flourish more richly,

116
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,568
both in numbers and variety.

117
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:59,453
The Serengeti plains in East Africa
support over a million wildebeest.

118
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,292
The herds follow the seasonal rains,

119
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,421
grazing on the newly-sprouting grass
that comes in their wake.

120
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,726
Each year, within a three-week period,

121
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:27,773
the females give birth
to over a quarter of a million calves.

122
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,743
This youngster is just a few days old.

123
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:45,124
Playing strengthens its legs
for the long journey that lies ahead.

124
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,283
The calf must stay close to its mother.

125
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,202
Without her milk, it would starve.

126
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,959
And the herds are always traveling,

127
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,172
following the rains
as they drift across the plains

128
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,799
in order to find fresh grazing.

129
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,265
Eventually, they reach woodlands.

130
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,660
Hunting dogs.

131
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,168
Wildebeest calves are a favorite prey.

132
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,382
And the dogs are hungry.

133
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,485
The calf must stay with its mother,
protected within the herd.

134
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,030
The dogs have incredible stamina...

135
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,704
but the calf is defended by the herd.

136
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,631
They need the calf on its own.

137
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,987
The mother blocks the dogs,
shielding her calf.

138
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,621
It makes a run for safety.

139
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:25,761
And it just manages
to get back to the herd.

140
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:58,418
The future of this whole migration
depends on the regularity of the rains,

141
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:04,132
but also on the continued existence
of the great open grasslands

142
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,844
across which the herds
make their immense journeys.

143
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:21,608
In places where rains fall abundantly
throughout the year, forests grow,

144
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,070
and in the warmth of the tropics,

145
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,573
they support
an unparalleled richness of life.

146
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:35,205
Half of all the species
of land-living animals

147
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,666
live in these stable worlds.

148
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,714
The sheer diversity is breathtaking.

149
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,639
We still have not catalogued

150
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:56,143
all the species that live
in the tropical forests.

151
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:16,621
The relationships between them all
are multitudinous and complex.

152
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,339
Plants often depend on animals
to pollinate their flowers.

153
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,928
And these intimate connections

154
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:35,682
are just as important
as the great global ones.

155
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,277
These are traps.

156
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,739
Flowers shaped like buckets,

157
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:52,782
produced by an orchid.

158
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:07,255
Each red bucket is filled
with an oily liquid that drips from above.

159
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:18,850
Male orchid bees need a rich perfume
with which to impress their females,

160
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,562
and the orchids provide it.

161
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,985
But the bucket is slippery,

162
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:35,534
and the liquid
into which the bee has fallen is sticky.

163
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,997
The only way to get out

164
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,167
is through a narrow tunnel.

165
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:51,007
As it emerges, the bee is gripped tight.

166
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,179
And that gives enough time for the plant

167
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,183
to glue pollen sacs on the bee's back.

168
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:08,149
So the orchid has its pollen
taken to another plant...

169
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,154
and the bee is rewarded with a perfume,

170
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,116
with which, when it recovers its strength,

171
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,201
it can woo a female.

172
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:29,170
There are no pronounced seasons
in a rainforest.

173
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:37,012
It produces food in one form or another
the year round.

174
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,352
It's so rich
that the females of some birds

175
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,856
are able to raise their young
entirely by themselves,

176
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:52,777
and that allows the males to spend
their whole time attracting females...

177
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,822
...as manakins do.

178
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,452
There are over 50 different species,

179
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:03,955
each with its own
highly elaborate dance routine.

180
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,381
The golden-collared manakin

181
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,259
starts by clearing his dance floor.

182
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,188
A female arrives
and he starts his routine,

183
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:30,565
rocketing from one perch to another.

184
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,073
She checks out every detail.

185
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,877
Finally, he performs his signature move.

186
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,297
The back-flip...

187
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,511
...with twist.

188
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,057
Perfection.

189
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:13,024
The red-capped manakin
has a very different act.

190
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,697
It's a kind of slither.

191
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,625
With wing snaps.

192
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,682
But it doesn't seem to be working.

193
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,325
She's seen enough.

194
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:13,668
The most complex routine
is that developed by the blue manakin.

195
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,966
The lead male
is supported by three junior dancers.

196
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,305
They practice together almost every day.

197
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,517
During rehearsals,

198
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:33,646
a young male in juvenile plumage
stands in for the female.

199
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,696
The dance
has to be perfectly synchronized.

200
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,871
With the lead male happy...

201
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,419
they're ready to present their dance
to a female.

202
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:13,520
In a carousel of movements,
each male takes his turn at the front.

203
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,794
The lead male performs the final move.

204
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,508
Have they done enough?

205
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,719
What's her decision?

206
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,351
It's...

207
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,812
a yes!

208
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,985
A great team effort.

209
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:12,495
Tropical forests cover
only seven percent of the planet's lands.

210
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:18,084
Away from the tropics,
where the weather is seasonal and cooler,

211
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,752
they're very different.

212
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,968
The greatest of all is the boreal forest

213
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:31,347
that extends right across North America
and Eurasia.

214
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:41,983
It cannot grow
during the frigid grip of winter.

215
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,948
The forests are a crucial refuge

216
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:53,786
for the relatively few species
that are able to survive here.

217
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:03,171
As winter approaches,

218
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:08,593
caribou grazing on the open tundra
to the north

219
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:13,431
head south to the forest
to seek food and shelter.

220
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:29,906
Out here, temperatures may fall
below minus 40 degrees centigrade.

221
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:42,835
The forest will give some protection
from the worst of the weather.

222
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:13,241
But now the caribou
are not traveling alone.

223
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:23,834
Wolves.

224
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,255
They live in the forest year-round.

225
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,597
And in the winter,
they specialize in hunting caribou.

226
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,906
They must find the freshest tracks.

227
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,880
They move fast by avoiding the deep snow,

228
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,134
sticking to the hard-packed trails
made by the caribou.

229
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,142
This wolf has found fresh scent.

230
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,321
The caribou must be close.

231
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:48,419
The herd chooses to stop to rest
on a frozen lake.

232
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,217
Out in the open, they will be able to spot
approaching danger.

233
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,265
And sure enough, the wolves catch up.

234
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,949
They start to test the caribou,

235
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,576
probing for any weakness.

236
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,091
Out on the open lake,

237
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,594
the caribou can outrun the wolves...

238
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,354
so the wolves drive them back
into the forest.

239
00:35:56,571 --> 00:36:01,534
Here, in the deep snow,
progress is much harder and slower.

240
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:14,881
And, hidden by the trees,
the wolves can get closer.

241
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,346
The hunt is on.

242
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,988
The pack must decide
which particular caribou to target

243
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,408
and which trail to take.

244
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,250
As the caribou scatter,

245
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,214
the leading wolf takes a wrong turn.

246
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:04,764
It's a crucial mistake,
and the wolves abandon the chase.

247
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:18,402
With the coming of spring,
the caribou will head north once more,

248
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,614
leaving the wolves and the forest behind.

249
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:29,747
They will travel 600 kilometers,
crossing mountains to reach the tundra,

250
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,875
where the spring grass
will be sprouting again,

251
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,835
and they can give birth.

252
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,218
But these migrations
are a shadow of what they once were.

253
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:48,307
The herd has lost
nearly 70 percent of its numbers

254
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,268
in the last 20 years.

255
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:58,150
Their world and all of our planet
is now changing fast.

256
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,660
At the furthest polar extremes

257
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:13,541
lie the frozen wildernesses
of Antarctica and the Arctic.

258
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,173
Though they may seem remote
to many of us,

259
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:27,388
the stability of these icy wastes
is crucial to all life on the planet.

260
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:39,025
But in just 70 years,
things have changed at a frightening pace.

261
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:46,449
The polar regions are warming faster
than any other part of the planet.

262
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:57,710
The Arctic in the north is a frozen ocean,

263
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,466
and the sea ice,
on which all life here depends,

264
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,634
is disappearing.

265
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,777
Polar bears

266
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,406
specialize in hunting seals
out on the frozen ocean.

267
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,042
But that world is now, literally,
melting beneath their feet.

268
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,799
The sea ice breaks up every year,

269
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,385
but now this is happening earlier,

270
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,347
and the bears' limited hunting season
is getting shorter.

271
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:57,103
This is already having a profound impact.

272
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,412
Cubs are growing up underweight,
which reduces their chances of survival.

273
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:37,643
Within the lifetime of these cubs,

274
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:42,731
the Arctic in summer
could be largely free of sea ice.

275
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,251
It's not just the sea ice
that is vanishing.

276
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:08,174
The ice that lies on land
is also changing fast.

277
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,847
This is Greenland,

278
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:20,853
a vast expanse of ice
one-fifth the size of the United States.

279
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:31,614
This glacial ice,
together with the sea ice,

280
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:37,077
protects our planet by reflecting
solar radiation away from the surface

281
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,606
and so preventing the Earth
from overheating.
But the Arctic is warming dramatically.

282
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,893
The leading edge of the Store Glacier
may appear to be motionless,

283
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:06,106
but glaciers can move
at up to 45 meters a day.

284
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:18,035
Where this one meets the sea,
it towers 100 meters above the water,

285
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:22,831
and continues downward
for another 400 meters

286
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,333
beneath the surface.

287
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:12,840
Over the last 20 years,
Greenland has been losing ice.

288
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,766
And the rate of loss is accelerating.

289
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,452
These massive icefalls
from the top of the glacier

290
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,370
are just the beginnings

291
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,789
of a far greater event.

292
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:55,215
A stretch of the front face of the glacier
over a kilometer long

293
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,343
is starting to break away.

294
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,190
From 400 meters beneath the surface,

295
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,652
the hidden ice is surging upwards.

296
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,590
The breakaway of an iceberg
the size of a skyscraper

297
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:40,678
generates a colossal tidal wave.

298
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:02,885
Within 20 minutes,
75 million tons of ice break free.

299
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,771
Glaciers have always released ice
into the ocean,

300
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,192
but now this is happening
nearly twice as fast

301
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,360
as it did ten years ago.

302
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:29,119
Around the world, ice is now feeding
vast amounts of fresh water into the sea,

303
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:35,626
raising sea levels, changing salinity,
and disrupting ocean currents.

304
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:44,343
Without the Humboldt Current,
the coast of Peru would fall silent.

305
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,889
The seabird spectacle would be no more.

306
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:05,489
All across our planet,
crucial connections are being disrupted.

307
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:14,665
The stability that we
and all life relies upon is being lost.

308
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:21,088
What we do in the next 20 years

309
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:26,635
will determine the future
for all life on Earth.

310
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:40,566
The rest of this series will explore
the planet's most important habitats,

311
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:45,779
and celebrate the life they still support.

312
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,790
We will reveal what must be preserved

313
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:03,672
if we are to ensure a future
where humans and nature can thrive.

314
