1
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,772
<i>Just 50 years ago,</i>

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>we finally ventured to the moon.</i>

3
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:42,167
<i>For the very first time,</i>

4
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,837
<i>we looked back at our own planet.</i>

5
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:58,683
<i>Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.</i>

6
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,651
<i>This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain</i>

7
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,572
<i>and reveal what we must preserve</i>

8
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,785
<i>to ensure people and nature thrive.</i>

9
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,370
<i>Fresh water.</i>

10
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,959
<i>Everything that lives on land,
animal or plant,</i>

11
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:07,961
<i>depends upon it.</i>

12
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:13,758
<i>Yet only one percent of it
is within reach.</i>

13
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,530
<i>The desert of central Australia.</i>

14
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:42,162
<i>One of the hottest, driest places
on Earth.</i>

15
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,544
<i>Virtually nothing can live here
for any length of time.</i>

16
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:57,510
<i>Yet once a decade,
this vast, empty desert is transformed.</i>

17
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:05,101
<i>For that to happen,
a chain reaction has to be triggered</i>

18
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,770
<i>two thousand kilometers to the north.</i>

19
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,490
<i>There, each year,
the moisture-laden clouds of the monsoon</i>

20
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,576
<i>begin to build.</i>

21
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,385
<i>Eventually they burst,
and the process begins.</i>

22
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,526
<i>Riverbeds that have been dry for years
suddenly fill.</i>

23
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,954
<i>The torrents join together
and race towards the interior</i>

24
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,164
<i>and the lowest land on the continent.</i>

25
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:15,880
<i>Here, they flood over the desert
and create Australia's largest lake,</i>

26
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,216
<i>Kati Thanda, Lake Eyre.</i>

27
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:29,060
<i>Huge numbers of fish
swim down these wide waterways</i>

28
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,062
<i>and into the growing lake.</i>

29
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:42,532
<i>Pelicans arrive from Australia's coasts,
hundreds of kilometers away.</i>

30
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:50,707
<i>Many will only see the lake fill
once in their entire lives,</i>

31
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:56,421
<i>so how they know the lake has formed,
and in which direction to reach it,</i>

32
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:57,880
<i>is still a mystery.</i>

33
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:13,229
<i>These new waters now contain so much food
that the birds start to breed.</i>

34
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,034
<i>But the clock is ticking.</i>

35
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,747
<i>The pelicans feed...</i>

36
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,124
<i>and feed...</i>

37
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,002
<i>and feed.</i>

38
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,548
<i>The chicks must grow quickly,</i>

39
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:44,177
<i>for they have to be strong enough
to leave within a matter of weeks.</i>

40
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,224
<i>But time is short,</i>

41
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,935
<i>for the parents
will only be able to find food</i>

42
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,562
<i>while the water remains.</i>

43
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:04,238
<i>The young pelicans set off
on their first long journey.</i>

44
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,162
<i>It will be a demanding one, to the coast,</i>

45
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,082
<i>and the nearest is 500 kilometers away.</i>

46
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,504
<i>The lake will soon dry,</i>

47
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,925
<i>and water may not return here
for another decade.</i>

48
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:34,477
<i>This boom to bust transformation
is an exceptional event.</i>

49
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,901
<i>But everywhere,
the availability of fresh water</i>

50
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:46,114
<i>is becoming increasingly unpredictable
and uncertain.</i>

51
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:04,090
<i>Much of the planet's fresh water,
however, is locked away.</i>

52
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:11,848
<i>Almost two-thirds of it
lies frozen around the poles.</i>

53
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,353
<i>This ice is several kilometers thick</i>

54
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:21,315
<i>and may have been lying here
for millions of years.</i>

55
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,622
<i>Every summer, some of it melts</i>

56
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,917
<i>and carves its way
into the heart of the glaciers.</i>

57
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,676
<i>These great caves
are beautiful and romantic,</i>

58
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,764
<i>but they're also dangerous places,
for glaciers are always on the move.</i>

59
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,252
<i>Even away from the poles,</i>

60
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,458
<i>much of the land's fresh water
freezes each winter.</i>

61
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:28,049
<i>But when spring arrives,
this vast snowy reservoir melts</i>

62
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,218
<i>and a great journey begins.</i>

63
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,227
<i>Racing down the steep mountain slopes,</i>

64
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,231
<i>the ice-cold waters
collect a life-giving ingredient...</i>

65
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,193
<i>oxygen.</i>

66
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,203
<i>Here, on the rivers of the Andes
in South America,</i>

67
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,205
<i>there is a living to be made</i>

68
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,250
<i>for those that can cope
with the powerful currents.</i>

69
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,336
<i>And torrent ducks can.</i>

70
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:20,518
<i>These chilly headwaters
may be oxygen-rich,</i>

71
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,895
<i>but they contain few nutrients.</i>

72
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,233
<i>The torrent ducks collect
what little food there is</i>

73
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,235
<i>from below the surface.</i>

74
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,794
<i>Stonefly and mayfly larvae have gills,</i>

75
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,589
<i>with which they extract oxygen
from the water.</i>

76
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,929
<i>Their flattened bodies
resist the relentless pull of the current.</i>

77
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,560
<i>Black fly larvae.</i>

78
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,395
<i>One of the ducks' favorite prey.</i>

79
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,526
<i>Their specialized mouthparts
filter out the tiny particles of food</i>

80
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,694
<i>as they race by.</i>

81
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,991
<i>Hooks at the rear end
anchor them to the rocks,</i>

82
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,994
<i>but the current
is sometimes irresistible.</i>

83
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:31,130
<i>However, they have a special safety line,
with which they can pull themselves back.</i>

84
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:51,901
<i>Every year, visitors come
to these rushing, oxygen-rich waters.</i>

85
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:55,571
<i>Salmon.</i>

86
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,619
<i>They have spent most of their lives
in the Pacific Ocean.</i>

87
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:11,629
<i>Now, fully grown, they're returning
to the particular rivers in North America</i>

88
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,256
<i>where they will now lay their eggs.</i>

89
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:22,723
<i>Salmon have an extraordinary ability
to leap up waterfalls,</i>

90
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:29,480
<i>but even they cannot, unaided,
cross the dams that we have built.</i>

91
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:39,573
<i>Today, Pacific salmon number less than
one percent of the numbers they used to,</i>

92
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:43,077
<i>and that's causing problems
for many other animals.</i>

93
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:52,044
<i>Alaskan brown bears
wait for them at the waterfalls.</i>

94
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,845
<i>Without these fish,</i>

95
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:04,265
<i>the bears cannot build up
the fat reserves they need</i>

96
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,893
<i>to sustain themselves
through their long winter hibernation.</i>

97
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,445
<i>There is fierce competition
for the best fishing spots.</i>

98
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:59,862
<i>Where water flows over hard rock,
it collects few nutrients,</i>

99
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,031
<i>so few plants can grow in it.</i>

100
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,243
<i>Here, in South America, however,</i>

101
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,955
<i>this plant, Macarenia,
manages to flourish.</i>

102
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,127
<i>For a few months each year,</i>

103
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,839
<i>when the water level is low enough
for sunlight to reach the bottom,</i>

104
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,175
<i>the Macarenia bursts into bloom.</i>

105
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:31,894
<i>This is the Caño Cristales,
Colombia's rainbow river.</i>

106
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,741
<i>Sometimes, however,
water disappears underground,</i>

107
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,785
<i>beyond the reach of light,</i>

108
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,663
<i>and there, no plants can live.</i>

109
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:58,879
<i>Thirty percent of the planet's fresh water
lies beneath the surface of the land,</i>

110
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,882
<i>either within the substance
of porous rocks</i>

111
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:05,052
<i>or as subterranean lakes and rivers.</i>

112
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,641
<i>Made slightly acid by rain,</i>

113
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:14,854
<i>it slowly dissolves limestone,
creating great caves.</i>

114
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:22,695
<i>A labyrinth of such passages and chambers
underlies much of the state of Florida.</i>

115
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,490
<i>For the most part, they're barren.</i>

116
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:33,372
<i>But where the water comes to the surface,
it's full of life.</i>

117
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,251
<i>Fish are abundant.</i>

118
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,176
<i>And so are fish eaters.</i>

119
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,804
<i>Otters.</i>

120
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:05,529
<i>All over the state,
fresh water bubbles to the surface</i>

121
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,283
<i>from the greatest concentration of springs
on Earth.</i>

122
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:32,181
<i>They feed rivers and pools,
in which all kinds of life flourish,</i>

123
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,893
<i>including one of Florida's specialities...</i>

124
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,520
<i>manatees.</i>

125
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,612
<i>Many spend the summer in the sea,</i>

126
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,407
<i>but when winter approaches,
they swim up the rivers,</i>

127
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,034
<i>which are relatively warm.</i>

128
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,880
<i>And there they graze
on an abundance of freshwater plants.</i>

129
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,264
<i>But human beings are now taking
so much water from these springs,</i>

130
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,058
<i>and polluting many of the others,</i>

131
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,687
<i>that the manatees
are losing their winter homes.</i>

132
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:38,038
<i>Rivers, being comparatively shallow,
warm quickly,</i>

133
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:40,207
<i>and in spring, across Europe,</i>

134
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:44,378
<i>the rising temperatures
trigger a sudden surge of life.</i>

135
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:05,149
<i>On Hungary's Tisza River,
giant mayfly are starting to emerge.</i>

136
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,825
<i>For three years,
they've lived underwater as larvae.</i>

137
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,996
<i>Now, in just three hours,</i>

138
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:24,585
<i>millions of the winged adults
dance together and mate before they die.</i>

139
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:45,230
<i>This extraordinary spectacle
was once common in Eastern Europe,</i>

140
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,026
<i>but so many rivers
now have stabilized banks</i>

141
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,819
<i>and are badly polluted</i>

142
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,280
<i>that the mayflies
have largely disappeared.</i>

143
00:17:56,658 --> 00:18:00,954
<i>But when the rivers are clean,
wildlife is quick to return.</i>

144
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:27,106
<i>The kingfisher,
the most glorious of divers.</i>

145
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,848
<i>The osprey, the most skillful of graspers.</i>

146
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:43,932
<i>Iguazu, on the frontier
between Brazil and Argentina.</i>

147
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,980
<i>These are
the largest waterfalls on the planet.</i>

148
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,612
<i>Thousands of tons of fresh water
thunder over them every second.</i>

149
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:11,418
<i>Much of Iguazu's water
comes from the Amazon rainforest,</i>

150
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:13,378
<i>a thousand kilometers away.</i>

151
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,683
<i>There, it rose as vapor
from the surface of the jungle canopy.</i>

152
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:32,314
<i>A single tree can give off
a thousand liters a day.</i>

153
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:39,738
<i>As the vapor rises into the sky,
it condenses into clouds.</i>

154
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,912
<i>Twenty billion tons of water
leave the forest each day,</i>

155
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,082
<i>more than travels
down the Amazon River itself.</i>

156
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,629
<i>If the rainforest is destroyed,</i>

157
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,257
<i>this life-giving cycle will be broken.</i>

158
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,263
<i>As the clouds travel across the continent,
they shed their water,</i>

159
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,015
<i>irrigating farmland and forest alike.</i>

160
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,102
<i>And on the plains of Brazil,</i>

161
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:13,897
<i>they create
the largest tropical wetland on Earth,</i>

162
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,066
<i>the Pantanal.</i>

163
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:22,322
<i>Each year, however,
seasonal changes reduce the river's flow,</i>

164
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:26,159
<i>and the Pantanal shrinks
to just a few river channels.</i>

165
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:34,293
<i>This suits the top predator very well.</i>

166
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,214
<i>The jaguar.</i>

167
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,511
<i>It's a competent swimmer, but in water,</i>

168
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:48,473
<i>it can't make the killing pounce
which makes it such a fearsome hunter.</i>

169
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,689
<i>Now, in the dry season,</i>

170
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,735
<i>the banks can get somewhat crowded.</i>

171
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,202
<i>But the jaguar has spotted prey
on the river's edge.</i>

172
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,052
<i>Capybara.</i>

173
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,932
<i>It must get close to be successful.</i>

174
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:04,174
<i>Two capybara incautiously
are standing in the shallows.</i>

175
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,270
<i>They have seen one another.</i>

176
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,319
<i>Which will run first?</i>

177
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:52,055
<i>Farther along the river,
dense vegetation provides better cover,</i>

178
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,726
<i>but the bank here is quite high.</i>

179
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,899
<i>Capybara have acute hearing.</i>

180
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,946
<i>One noisy footfall...</i>

181
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,490
<i>...and the chance is lost.
Another failure.</i>

182
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:14,596
<i>Perhaps it's time to try a different prey.</i>

183
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,563
<i>Tackling one of these would be risky,</i>

184
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,775
<i>but the jaguar is really hungry.</i>

185
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,870
<i>If a jaguar is to catch a caiman,</i>

186
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:43,625
<i>it must bite its neck and then hold on
to prevent the caiman striking back.</i>

187
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:50,507
<i>It has to get into a position
directly above its prey.</i>

188
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,557
<i>This is dangerous.</i>

189
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,583
<i>The caiman rolls
to try and drown the jaguar.</i>

190
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,632
<i>Predator and prey seem evenly matched.</i>

191
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,933
<i>The jaguar won't let go.</i>

192
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:06,750
<i>After 20 minutes, and near to exhaustion,
the jaguar wins.</i>

193
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:21,514
<i>Sometimes, a river's downward journey
is interrupted by lakes.</i>

194
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:28,730
<i>Together, they contain 40 times more water
than all the world's rivers combined.</i>

195
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:34,235
<i>Africa's Lake Tanganyika</i>

196
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,157
<i>holds almost a fifth
of all accessible fresh water on Earth.</i>

197
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:49,376
<i>But, considering its great size,
Tanganyika contains little life.</i>

198
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,385
<i>It's almost a kilometer and a half deep,</i>

199
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:03,723
<i>but at the bottom the water barely moves
and there is no oxygen.</i>

200
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:11,064
<i>It's only close to the surface,
in its top 150 meters,</i>

201
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,984
<i>that the water contains enough oxygen
for life to exist.</i>

202
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,990
<i>But here, it flourishes in abundance.</i>

203
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:28,289
<i>Two hundred and fifty species
of cichlid fish have evolved here,</i>

204
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,542
<i>many of which are found nowhere else.</i>

205
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,597
<i>Competition in these crowded waters
is intense.</i>

206
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:51,730
<i>A male callipterus cichlid
collects shells.</i>

207
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:58,278
<i>The more shells a male has,
the more females he will attract.</i>

208
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,076
<i>And this one is doing very well.</i>

209
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,776
<i>His neighbor has a rather smaller mound.</i>

210
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,992
<i>And the neighbor is a thief.</i>

211
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,833
<i>As soon as he turns his back,</i>

212
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,047
<i>the thief swoops in...</i>

213
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,384
<i>and steals a shell.</i>

214
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:18,650
<i>The hardworking owner of the larger mound
doesn't seem to notice.</i>

215
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:25,073
<i>So, the thief commits the crime again...</i>

216
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:27,826
<i>and again...</i>

217
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,667
<i>until he has built the largest mound.</i>

218
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,715
<i>The shells are not just for display.</i>

219
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,469
<i>They will be used by the females
as cradles.</i>

220
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,766
<i>One arrives.</i>

221
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,603
<i>She's tiny, only a tenth of his size.</i>

222
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:01,276
<i>She's so small,
she can slip inside a shell.</i>

223
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:15,331
<i>There, she lays her eggs,
and the male quickly fertilizes them.</i>

224
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:23,423
<i>She will then stay inside protecting them
for up to a fortnight until they hatch.</i>

225
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,346
<i>The emperor,</i>

226
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,057
<i>the largest of all the cichlids
in Tanganyika.</i>

227
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:40,532
<i>At almost a meter long, this female
must raise her young in the open.</i>

228
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:51,202
<i>Guarding them is therefore
a full-time job for both parents.</i>

229
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:03,630
<i>But the future for all these fish
is uncertain.</i>

230
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:11,387
<i>As global temperatures rise,
Lake Tanganyika is warming.</i>

231
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,726
<i>Its waters are no longer mixing as well
as they once did,</i>

232
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:20,563
<i>so the top oxygenated layer is reducing.</i>

233
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,493
<i>The Mekong River in Southeast Asia.</i>

234
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:39,207
<i>Four thousand kilometers long
and with the widest falls anywhere.</i>

235
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:47,882
<i>Today, over 60 million people
depend upon it for their livelihood.</i>

236
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:15,076
<i>The monsoon rains create
such a colossal surge of water</i>

237
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,787
<i>that the falls themselves
almost disappear.</i>

238
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,084
<i>The water is loaded with sediment,</i>

239
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:27,171
<i>collected during the Mekong's long journey
from the Tibetan Plateau.</i>

240
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:35,221
<i>Even before the flood,
the water covers a vast area of land.</i>

241
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,230
<i>These exposed roots are evidence</i>

242
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:47,275
<i>of the great rise in water level
that is to come.</i>

243
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,574
<i>When the main flood does arrive,</i>

244
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,660
<i>the trees are submerged
up to their branches.</i>

245
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:07,295
<i>For a few months, the floodwaters create
the planet's greatest breeding grounds</i>

246
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,713
<i>for freshwater fish.</i>

247
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:16,721
<i>One species
has a particularly ingenious solution</i>

248
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:20,641
<i>to the problems of living
in shallow, oxygen-poor water.</i>

249
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,147
<i>The Siamese fighting fish.</i>

250
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,073
<i>The male breathes
by gulping air from the surface,</i>

251
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,699
<i>and during the breeding season</i>

252
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:40,703
<i>he uses that ability
to build a raft of bubbles.</i>

253
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,166
<i>Day after day he labors.</i>

254
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:56,886
<i>A female, waiting nearby,
rises to inspect the raft.</i>

255
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:16,906
<i>They wrap themselves around one another
in a tender embrace.</i>

256
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,628
<i>This union encourages her
to release her eggs.</i>

257
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,093
<i>As they sink downwards,
the male fertilizes them.</i>

258
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,934
<i>Both carefully collect them,</i>

259
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:54,902
<i>and then blow them, one by one,
into the bubble nest.</i>

260
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,868
<i>Oxygen is scarce in these stagnant waters,</i>

261
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,328
<i>but the eggs
will get enough from the bubbles</i>

262
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,788
<i>to allow them to develop.</i>

263
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,335
<i>The climax of the flood is still to come.</i>

264
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,675
<i>Eventually,
so much water surges down the Mekong</i>

265
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:23,389
<i>that the Tonlé Sap Lake expands
to five times its dry-season size.</i>

266
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:30,438
<i>Vast numbers of fish now swim
into these new feeding grounds.</i>

267
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,277
<i>People have harvested this seasonal event
for millennia.</i>

268
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,114
<i>They set nets across half of the river,</i>

269
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,533
<i>leaving the other half free</i>

270
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,453
<i>for the rest of the fish
to swim on and breed.</i>

271
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:55,171
<i>The Mekong, in fact, supports
the largest inland fishery in the world.</i>

272
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:06,015
<i>One-fifth of all the freshwater fish
caught by people worldwide</i>

273
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,643
<i>comes from this one river system.</i>

274
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,064
<i>But the future of the Mekong,</i>

275
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,650
<i>like that of so many other rivers
around the world,</i>

276
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,693
<i>is increasingly at risk.</i>

277
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,157
<i>We have changed the natural flow</i>

278
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,786
<i>of more than two-thirds
of the planet's longest rivers</i>

279
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:30,998
<i>by, amongst other things,
building dams across them.</i>

280
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:44,136
<i>So now, many rivers across the world
no longer flow.</i>

281
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,897
<i>Here in East Africa, in Ruaha, Tanzania,</i>

282
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,317
<i>these elephants are searching for water.</i>

283
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:08,077
<i>Each needs to drink 200 liters every day,
and there doesn't seem to be any here.</i>

284
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:14,709
<i>But the elephants know that baobab wood
contains a lot of moisture.</i>

285
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:21,215
<i>And in an emergency,
they eat it in great quantities.</i>

286
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,100
<i>Lions also need water.</i>

287
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:41,027
<i>And conveniently for the lions,
water is where their prey will gather.</i>

288
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:48,868
<i>So both predators and prey
head for the rivers.</i>

289
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,334
<i>Until 30 years ago,</i>

290
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,337
<i>rivers in this part of Africa
never ran dry.</i>

291
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:08,637
<i>Now, agriculture upstream
is taking great quantities,</i>

292
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:13,351
<i>and during the dry season,
the rivers shrink into isolated pools.</i>

293
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:36,207
<i>Hippos rely on flowing water
to keep themselves cool during the day,</i>

294
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:40,211
<i>but now they have to make do with mud.</i>

295
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,427
<i>As the water level falls still further,
they cram together.</i>

296
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,475
<i>Tempers begin to fray.</i>

297
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:20,709
<i>Each day, the mud pools shrink further,
and the hippos' plight worsens.</i>

298
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,976
<i>Buffalo, in the urgent search for water.</i>

299
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:52,950
<i>The lions are already here
at this water hole.</i>

300
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:07,131
<i>However, the buffalo are driven on
by their desperate need for fresh water.</i>

301
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,314
<i>They need to drink every day.</i>

302
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,081
<i>Every drink is now a risk,</i>

303
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,793
<i>but the buffalo have no choice.</i>

304
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:03,747
<i>As the drought continues,
the buffalo begin to weaken.</i>

305
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,586
<i>The odds are changing,
in the lions' favor.</i>

306
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,187
<i>The elephants have reached their river.</i>

307
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:35,112
<i>Nothing else is here because it's dry.</i>

308
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,878
<i>But elephants can find water
where others can't.</i>

309
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:57,051
<i>They use their trunks to dig holes
in the sand of the riverbed.</i>

310
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,271
<i>The extraordinary sense of smell</i>

311
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:13,067
<i>that enables them to detect open water
from kilometers away</i>

312
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:17,404
<i>also helps them
to locate places underground</i>

313
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,282
<i>where it lies closest to the surface.</i>

314
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:29,291
<i>In severe droughts,
the wells they dig can be their lifeline.</i>

315
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:42,471
<i>The hardships of the dry season
have always been part of life</i>

316
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,306
<i>on East Africa's plains,</i>

317
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,850
<i>but as the planet warms,</i>

318
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,604
<i>and we ourselves take so much water
for our own purposes,</i>

319
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,692
<i>the droughts are becoming more frequent
and more severe.</i>

320
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,876
<i>The Platte River,
in Nebraska, North America.</i>

321
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:36,358
<i>Each year, sandhill cranes arrive here
as they travel north across America</i>

322
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:40,446
<i>on one of the last great migrations
made by any animal.</i>

323
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:45,325
<i>It's one of their crucial staging posts.</i>

324
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:58,547
<i>The river once flooded the prairie
for a mile in all directions.</i>

325
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:06,680
<i>This was a perfect place
for them to feed and rest.</i>

326
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,980
<i>Now, we have dammed the river</i>

327
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:18,484
<i>and taken so much of its water
for our own use</i>

328
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:22,404
<i>that there is little space left
for the cranes.</i>

329
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:41,507
<i>But conservationists
now manage the river's flow in such a way</i>
