1
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,772
<i>Just 50 years ago,</i>

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>we finally ventured to the moon.</i>

3
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,795
<i>For the very first time,
we looked back at our own planet.</i>

4
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:58,683
<i>Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.</i>

5
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,651
<i>This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain</i>

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,280
<i>and reveal what we must preserve</i>

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,868
<i>to ensure people and nature thrive.</i>

8
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,843
<i>The Earth still has sanctuaries,</i>

9
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:40,892
<i>and, on occasion, they hold
spectacular gatherings of wildlife.</i>

10
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:52,362
<i>They provide vital space,
but they're disappearing fast.</i>

11
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:12,734
<i>A fifth of the land
on our planet is covered by desert.</i>

12
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,953
<i>The driest of all
is the Atacama in South America.</i>

13
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,502
<i>There are places here
where rain has never been recorded.</i>

14
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,894
<i>Deserts may appear to be barren and empty,</i>

15
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,776
<i>but they are of crucial importance
to life.</i>

16
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,670
<i>For those that can overcome
their challenges,</i>

17
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,215
<i>they provide a vital refuge.</i>

18
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,023
<i>Socotran cormorants,</i>

19
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,903
<i>emerging from a dust storm
in the Arabian desert.</i>

20
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:52,000
<i>It is the very emptiness of this landscape
that has brought them here,</i>

21
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,299
<i>and they have come in immense numbers.</i>

22
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,932
<i>Fifty thousand of them.</i>

23
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,149
<i>A quarter of the total population.</i>

24
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,368
<i>They have come
because here they can breed...</i>

25
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,954
<i>undisturbed.</i>

26
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:48,181
<i>But nesting in a desert is difficult.</i>

27
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,936
<i>Temperatures can reach 40 degrees Celsius.</i>

28
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,192
<i>Yet, both the adults
and their white chicks</i>

29
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,194
<i>are ready for this challenge.</i>

30
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,201
<i>They cool themselves
by panting.</i>

31
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:20,797
<i>Any adult that appears to have food
in its crop is mobbed.</i>

32
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,303
<i>An adult will only give food
to its own chick,</i>

33
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,349
<i>which must be here somewhere.</i>

34
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,614
<i>The chicks chase an adult
out into the desert.</i>

35
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,331
<i>No luck.</i>

36
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,294
<i>Now, they must get back quickly
to the safety of the colony.</i>

37
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,931
<i>This desert provides the cormorants</i>

38
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,934
<i>with more than just a secure refuge.</i>

39
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,996
<i>Every morning, a mass movement begins.</i>

40
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,177
<i>It's the rush hour.</i>

41
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,997
<i>A shallow arm of the sea,
right beside the colony,</i>

42
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,082
<i>is full of food.</i>

43
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:27,215
<i>This richness comes
from the desert itself.</i>

44
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,551
<i>Dust, blown from the land,</i>

45
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,181
<i>contains nutrients
that fertilize the surrounding waters.</i>

46
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:49,570
<i>So, it is the desert itself
that enriches the sea.</i>

47
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:22,520
<i>In Oman, during the summer monsoon,
fogs roll in from the sea,</i>

48
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,107
<i>billowing over the Dhofar mountains.</i>

49
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:39,579
<i>The mists bring just enough moisture
to sustain a little vegetation...</i>

50
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:51,882
<i>and this sparse greenery
becomes a focus for life.</i>

51
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:06,105
<i>Ibex must cross the near vertical cliffs
to reach one of the few springs.</i>

52
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,985
<i>But they're nervous...</i>

53
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,572
<i>and with good reason.</i>

54
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,498
<i>An Arabian leopard,</i>

55
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,879
<i>one of less than 200
that survive in the wild.</i>

56
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,217
<i>This male's territory</i>

57
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:42,266
<i>extends over 350 square kilometers
of high mountains and deep wadis.</i>

58
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,403
<i>The southern edge
of the Arabian Peninsula</i>

59
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:58,407
<i>is one of the few places left
where there is enough prey</i>

60
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,036
<i>to sustain a population of these leopards.</i>

61
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,380
<i>But even so,Â there are probably
less than 60 individuals</i>

62
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:16,175
<i>in over 15,000 square kilometers.</i>

63
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,560
<i>These leopards have always been rare,</i>

64
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,024
<i>but now conflict with people</i>

65
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,695
<i>is causing their numbers
to decline still further.</i>

66
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,502
<i>Few leopards are left,</i>

67
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:58,050
<i>so what our hidden cameras now capture
verges on the miraculous.</i>

68
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,892
<i>A female leopard,</i>

69
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,188
<i>and she is tracking a male.</i>

70
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,374
<i>Such meetings
are becoming increasingly rare.</i>

71
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,902
<i>This briefest of unions</i>

72
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,531
<i>may ensure
the short-term future for these leopards.</i>

73
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,955
<i>But in the longer term,</i>

74
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,293
<i>their fate will depend
on their territory being protected.</i>

75
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,261
<i>To the north of the Dhofar mountains</i>

76
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,058
<i>lies a place
of almost unimaginable emptiness.</i>

77
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,186
<i>The Rub' al Khali,</i>

78
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,481
<i>the Empty Quarter.</i>

79
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,784
<i>The very name of the place</i>

80
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,288
<i>resonates with the romance
of these desert lands.</i>

81
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:03,342
<i>This is the largest sand sea
in the world.</i>

82
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,767
<i>There are parts
where human beings never venture.</i>

83
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:21,068
<i>Only the greatest desert specialists
can survive here.</i>

84
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,535
<i>Arabian oryx.</i>

85
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,666
<i>Their ranges are vast,</i>

86
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,879
<i>extending
for over 3,000 square kilometers.</i>

87
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,261
<i>This is one of their last refuges.</i>

88
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,518
<i>Once hunted close to extinction,</i>

89
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:58,564
<i>they have now reclaimed
their ancestral territory.</i>

90
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:07,156
<i>With the help of conservationists,
they have returned home.</i>

91
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:15,581
<i>But reintroduction
cannot save all desert animals.</i>

92
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,720
<i>Desert elephants.</i>

93
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:38,812
<i>Less than 150 survive, here in Namibia.</i>

94
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:48,197
<i>This oldest of deserts
is scarred by dry riverbeds,</i>

95
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:53,577
<i>carved by water that flows
for only one or two days in a year.</i>

96
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,959
<i>An adult elephant</i>

97
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:06,340
<i>must find up to 200 kilos of food
each and every day if it's not to starve.</i>

98
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:17,726
<i>So, for these last survivors,
life is an endless trek.</i>

99
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:29,321
<i>The herd is guided by a single old female,
the matriarch.</i>

100
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,243
<i>She is leading her family</i>

101
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,080
<i>to a special place
where food should be available</i>

102
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,873
<i>even in a drought.</i>

103
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,383
<i>She learned of its existence
from her mother,</i>

104
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,093
<i>many years ago.</i>

105
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:57,099
<i>Now, she's teaching her own calf
how to get there.</i>

106
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:08,861
<i>The elephants are not alone
in their search for food.</i>

107
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,076
<i>Desert lions.</i>

108
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,757
<i>They are just as
rare as the elephants.</i>

109
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,977
<i>The calf is protected
by its mother.</i>

110
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,020
<i>So the lions let them pass.</i>

111
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:52,071
<i>Distant trees are a sign of water.</i>

112
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,763
<i>The riverbed is dry.</i>

113
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,688
<i>The ana trees, however, are still green.</i>

114
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,405
<i>But there is a problem.</i>

115
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,743
<i>At this time of year,</i>

116
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,997
<i>seedpods from the ana trees
usually litter the ground.</i>

117
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,461
<i>Rich food for elephants.</i>

118
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,094
<i>But this year, the crop has failed.</i>

119
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:06,562
<i>The matriarch
has led her herd here for nothing.</i>

120
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,824
<i>Even the trees' leafy branches
are out of their reach.</i>

121
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:26,540
<i>The family has no option but to move on.</i>

122
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,562
<i>A bull, standing nearly four meters tall.</i>

123
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,983
<i>He can reach into the canopy,</i>

124
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,738
<i>and he could be the solution
to their problem.</i>

125
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:07,581
<i>The old female has known him all her life
and turned to him for help before.</i>

126
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,594
<i>Elephants can only survive here</i>

127
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,056
<i>because of knowledge
passed down over generations.</i>

128
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,811
<i>But less than 20 matriarchs still survive,</i>

129
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,191
<i>and if their knowledge is lost,</i>

130
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,528
<i>elephants may no longer
be able to live here.</i>

131
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:52,793
<i>Deserts cannot support
large numbers of animals the year round,</i>

132
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,090
<i>and even those specially adapted
to these conditions</i>

133
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,218
<i>can only survive in small numbers.</i>

134
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,306
<i>But on very special occasions,</i>

135
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,560
<i>deserts are transformed.</i>

136
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,069
<i>Once in a decade,</i>

137
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,489
<i>there may be a cloudburst.</i>

138
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,753
<i>A single one can turn the desert green.</i>

139
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,265
<i>In southern California,</i>

140
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,476
<i>the change is visible from space.</i>

141
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:07,200
<i>Hundreds of square kilometers
suddenly bloom.</i>

142
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,971
<i>If such transformations become regular,</i>

143
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,891
<i>a new habitat may develop.</i>

144
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,062
<i>Grasslands.</i>

145
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,940
<i>One of our planet's
most productive landscapes.</i>

146
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:50,535
<i>They supportÂ the greatest aggregations
of large animals on Earth.</i>

147
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:58,293
<i>The Serengeti sustains herds
of over a million wildebeest.</i>

148
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:07,636
<i>They follow the rains
to crop the newly sprung grass.</i>

149
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,236
<i>These vast herds attract predators.</i>

150
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,292
<i>Five male cheetahs.</i>

151
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,713
<i>One of the largest coalitions
ever observed.</i>

152
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:54,599
<i>They dominate a territory
of 450 square kilometers.</i>

153
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,690
<i>They patrol it together,</i>

154
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,194
<i>and that attracts attention.</i>

155
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,246
<i>A change of strategy is needed</i>

156
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,999
<i>if they're to hunt successfully.</i>

157
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,385
<i>They need cover.</i>

158
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,755
<i>An adult wildebeest
is a formidable opponent.</i>

159
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,984
<i>Four of the cheetahs start the stalk,</i>

160
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,320
<i>walking directly towards the prey.</i>

161
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:18,785
<i>The fifth creeps around the side.</i>

162
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:54,946
<i>They need to get really close
before making their final sprint.</i>

163
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,501
<i>They're nearly there.</i>

164
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,872
<i>All five break cover,</i>

165
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:49,584
<i>each cat chasing a different target.</i>

166
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,309
<i>It's chaos.</i>

167
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:16,528
<i>A single cheetah
is not strong enough to defend its prize.</i>

168
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,460
<i>They must work together.</i>

169
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:19,507
<i>These dramas only continue
because the Serengeti is protected,</i>

170
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,636
<i>and has been for over 65 years.</i>

171
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,309
<i>But the Serengeti is an exception.</i>

172
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:37,901
<i>Across the planet, space for grasslands
has been steadily disappearing.</i>

173
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:48,203
<i>A hundred and eighty years ago,
herds of bison, millions strong,</i>

174
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,581
<i>grazed the Great Plains
of North America.</i>

175
00:29:55,335 --> 00:30:00,089
<i>They roamed across a prairie
a hundred times larger than the Serengeti.</i>

176
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,683
<i>This was the true wild west.</i>

177
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,911
<i>Every summer,
the males roared their challenges</i>

178
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,415
<i>and fought for possession of the females.</i>

179
00:30:55,603 --> 00:31:00,108
<i>As the rut intensified,
the fights became more brutal.</i>

180
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:38,980
<i>Today, however,
most of the prairie is silent.</i>

181
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,363
<i>Humans slaughtered the great herds.</i>

182
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:54,454
<i>Less than 30,000 wild bison remain,</i>

183
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:01,085
<i>and 90 percent of the prairie
has been lost,</i>

184
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:05,298
<i>most of it to agriculture.</i>

185
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,784
<i>What we eat, and how we produce it,</i>

186
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:37,538
<i>will determine the future
of our planet's grasslands.</i>

187
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:49,550
<i>Our past could show us
how we can feed ourselves</i>

188
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,886
<i>and still leave room for nature.</i>

189
00:32:55,848 --> 00:33:01,396
<i>The ancient hay meadows of Hungary,
still farmed in the traditional way,</i>

190
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:05,316
<i>provide habitats
of extraordinary richness.</i>

191
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,372
<i>Butterflies are abundant.</i>

192
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:27,797
<i>One species has
an almost unbelievably complex life cycle.</i>

193
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,845
<i>The Alcon blue.</i>

194
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:41,978
<i>Each female must mate and lay eggs
on just one species of plant,</i>

195
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,563
<i>the marsh gentian.</i>

196
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,072
<i>The eggs soon hatch into caterpillars.</i>

197
00:33:55,825 --> 00:34:00,246
<i>High up on the plants,
they're safe from predators below.</i>

198
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:14,677
<i>But then, the caterpillars
do something seemingly suicidal.</i>

199
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:23,478
<i>They abseil down on threads of silk
to the ground below...</i>

200
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,231
<i>and into danger.</i>

201
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,284
<i>They have no defense
against the marauding ants,</i>

202
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,577
<i>which carry them off.</i>

203
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,419
<i>But this is exactlyÂ what the caterpillars
need to happen.</i>

204
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:55,676
<i>They're producing a scent
like that emitted by an ant larva.</i>

205
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,795
<i>The ants respond by taking
them back to their nest.</i>

206
00:35:10,919 --> 00:35:13,868
<i>There, they deposit them in
the colony's brood chamber.</i>

207
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:21,869
<i>The purple-colored caterpillars,
lying among the ants' own white larvae,</i>

208
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,206
<i>give off just the right signals.</i>

209
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,380
<i>And the nurse ants rush to feed them.</i>

210
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,300
<i>But there is more.</i>

211
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:43,141
<i>The caterpillars now start to mimic
the sounds made by the queen ant,</i>

212
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:49,188
<i>and, as a result,
the ants treat them like royalty.</i>

213
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,944
<i>If food gets short,</i>

214
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,990
<i>the ants will even feed the caterpillars
instead of their own young.</i>

215
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:06,622
<i>They give them such quantities of food
that the caterpillars grow hugely.</i>

216
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:19,886
<i>And there, underground, the caterpillars
feed and grow for nearly two years.</i>

217
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:27,351
<i>Until, one day,
there is nothing for the ants to feed.</i>

218
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,231
<i>The caterpillars have pupated.</i>

219
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,408
<i>But a few weeks later,</i>

220
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:46,913
<i>out crawls an Alcon blue butterfly.</i>

221
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,185
<i>Now, they begin to leave the nest</i>

222
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:13,522
<i>that has been their home
for the last 23 months.</i>

223
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,793
<i>The young adult
makes its way out of the nest</i>

224
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,795
<i>and clambers up a grass stem.</i>

225
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:41,509
<i>Its wings expand
as it prepares to fly off and find a mate.</i>

226
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:50,476
<i>This complex life
may be laborsaving for the butterfly,</i>

227
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,353
<i>but it's risky.</i>

228
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,858
<i>If anything happened to the ants
or to the gentian,</i>

229
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,362
<i>the Alcon blue would become extinct.</i>

230
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,797
<i>Only tiny fragments
of these ancient meadows</i>

231
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,173
<i>are left in Europe.</i>

232
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:26,679
<i>But beyond them to the east,</i>

233
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:33,269
<i>once stretched grasslandsÂ that extended
for a fifth of the way around the world,</i>

234
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,896
<i>from Romania to China.</i>

235
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:03,215
<i>Here, there are places where,
for mile after endless mile,</i>

236
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:06,344
<i>there are no roads or fences.</i>

237
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,437
<i>Here, where there are no trees,
eagles nest on the ground.</i>

238
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:30,326
<i>Once, these eagles would have preyed
on antelope that numbered in millions.</i>

239
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,583
<i>And some are still here.</i>

240
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:43,756
<i>These are saiga, antelope that live
nowhere else inÂ the world.</i>

241
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,261
<i>Their extraordinary noses
are specially adapted</i>

242
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:53,265
<i>to filter out the dust kicked up
by the immense herds</i>

243
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:54,600
<i>that once lived here.</i>

244
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,815
<i>Now, they're critically endangered.</i>

245
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:06,112
<i>Poaching and the loss of habitat
have had a devastating impact on them.</i>

246
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:13,494
<i>But conservation effortsÂ have recently
started to make a difference.</i>

247
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:20,668
<i>There is still hope
for these extraordinary plains dwellers.</i>

248
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:33,180
<i>And the proof of this
can be found further east, in Mongolia,</i>

249
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:37,476
<i>where the grasslands
still remain largely intact.</i>

250
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,693
<i>These are Przewalski's horses.</i>

251
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,197
<i>Fifty years ago,
they were extinct in the wild,</i>

252
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:54,076
<i>but a few adults survived in captivity.</i>

253
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:03,669
<i>Careful breeding from 12 of them
increased their numbers</i>

254
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,964
<i>until there were sufficient
to release on the plains.</i>

255
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,886
<i>These are their descendants.</i>

256
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,940
<i>A stallion protects eachÂ harem.</i>

257
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:34,283
<i>They must be vigilant,
and they race to defend their herd...</i>

258
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:46,629
<i>or chase off bachelors
trying to lure away a mare.</i>

259
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,687
<i>With their numbers now topping 300,</i>

260
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:08,651
<i>the future for these wild horses
looks more secure.</i>

261
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,990
<i>Their recovery was only possible</i>

262
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:20,663
<i>because the vast Mongolian steppe
still remains largely untouched.</i>

263
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:39,306
<i>These grasses are some of the tallest
to be found anywhere on our planet.</i>

264
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:47,314
<i>They're so tall
they can conceal elephants.</i>

265
00:42:56,365 --> 00:43:00,286
<i>They make the giants that live among them
seem small.</i>

266
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,223
<i>A last hiding place</i>

267
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:25,686
<i>for the highly endangered
greater one-horned rhino.</i>

268
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,990
<i>This is India,</i>

269
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,286
<i>one of the most populous countries
on Earth.</i>

270
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:51,420
<i>Yet here there is a great determination
to protect these crucial grasslands.</i>

271
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,145
<i>What must it be like</i>

272
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:12,191
<i>to live in this dense,
claustrophobic world?</i>

273
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,996
<i>Just moving about
could mean walking into danger.</i>

274
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:46,308
<i>The grasses conceal tigers.</i>

275
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:00,572
<i>Stripes and shadows blend.</i>

276
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:18,924
<i>Long grass
may hide a tigress from her prey,</i>

277
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:28,809
<i>but it also hides the prey from her.</i>

278
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:40,446
<i>She must get within 20 meters of it.</i>

279
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:51,540
<i>And she must always know
exactly where the prey are hidden.</i>

280
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,593
<i>She may have lost them.</i>

281
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,117
<i>She risks a look.</i>

282
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:44,403
<i>Every deer around
now knows exactly where the tiger is.</i>

283
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,713
<i>Others have heard the signal
that announced her failure.</i>

284
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:12,806
<i>Her cubs.</i>

285
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,235
<i>She had left them hidden in the grass.</i>

286
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,710
<i>In the last hundred years,</i>

287
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:47,799
<i>the number of wild tigers
has declined by over 95 percent.</i>

288
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:52,971
<i>But here in India,</i>

289
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,433
<i>despite the enormous pressure
from poaching,</i>

290
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,561
<i>and a growing human population,</i>

291
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,066
<i>tiger numbers are actually increasing.</i>

292
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:18,580
<i>Protect the precious space
that grasslands and deserts provide,</i>

293
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,169
