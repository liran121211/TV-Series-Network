1
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,772
<i>Just 50 years ago,</i>

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,276
<i>we finally ventured to the moon.</i>

3
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:45,837
<i>For the very first time,
we looked back at our own planet.</i>

4
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:58,683
<i>Since then, the human population
has more than doubled.</i>

5
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,651
<i>This series will celebrate
the natural wonders that remain,</i>

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,280
<i>and reveal what we must preserve</i>

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,826
<i>to ensure people and nature thrive.</i>

8
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:46,564
<i>The polar regions of our planet
may seem beyond the reach of most of us,</i>

9
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,532
<i>but they are not beyond our influence.</i>

10
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:05,458
<i>We, unintentionally,
are changing these frozen worlds,</i>

11
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,965
<i>and these changes
will not just affect the poles</i>

12
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,425
<i>but the whole planet.</i>

13
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,081
<i>Antarctica.</i>

14
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:52,463
{\an8}<i>The southern end of our planet,
and the coldest place on Earth.</i>

15
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,387
<i>It has been frozen for 30 million years.</i>

16
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,977
<i>In its center, the covering of ice
is over four kilometers thick.</i>

17
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,525
<i>Entire mountain ranges
are buried beneath it.</i>

18
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,032
<i>Here, it is so cold that each winter</i>

19
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:23,161
<i>19 million square kilometers of ocean
freezes,</i>

20
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,122
<i>more than doubling
the size of the ice cap.</i>

21
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,046
<i>But when, in spring, the sea ice melts,</i>

22
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,550
<i>life returns once again
to the continent's shores.</i>

23
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:48,478
<i>The peninsula that stretches north
towards South America</i>

24
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,482
<i>is the first part of it
to be released from winter's grip.</i>

25
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,616
<i>As the sea ice breaks up,</i>

26
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,328
<i>life returns.</i>

27
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,898
There is a <i>greater variety</i>
<i>of living creatures here</i>

28
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,818
<i>than anywhere else in Antarctica.</i>

29
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:58,339
<i>Gentoo penguins
spend most of their lives at sea,</i>

30
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,971
<i>but now, in spring,
they have to come ashore to breed.</i>

31
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,100
<i>They're the fastest of all penguins
in water,</i>

32
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:15,148
<i>but on land,
life takes on a slower pace.</i>

33
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,413
<i>It's an uphill struggle
to reach their nesting grounds...</i>

34
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,670
<i>...but penguins never give up.</i>

35
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,181
<i>The paths they follow,
carved by thousands of tiny footsteps,</i>

36
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,017
<i>lead to Antarctica's rarest commodity.</i>

37
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,774
<i>Bare rock.</i>

38
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,159
<i>Less than one percent of Antarctica
is ice-free,</i>

39
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,912
<i>and these rocky patches</i>

40
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,540
<i>are the only places
where gentoos can lay their eggs.</i>

41
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,131
<i>It's been a 30-minute struggle,</i>

42
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,931
<i>but he's almost at the top,
where his mate is waiting for him.</i>

43
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,991
<i>He presents her with a stone,</i>

44
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,663
<i>a gift to improve the nest
and so win her favor.</i>

45
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,715
<i>He's back just in time.</i>

46
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,930
<i>There's another mouth to feed.</i>

47
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:31,117
<i>Gentoo penguins used to be rare
in this part of Antarctica,</i>

48
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,247
<i>but now, as temperatures rise,
their numbers here are increasing.</i>

49
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,384
<i>Sea ice may appear to be flat
and lifeless,</i>

50
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:54,640
<i>but beneath it there is another world.</i>

51
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,901
<i>As the ice melts,
the light filters through,</i>

52
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:09,030
<i>and algae, that have been trapped
within the ice all winter, flourish.</i>

53
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,118
<i>This upside-down world</i>

54
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,330
<i>is the polar equivalent
of the great grasslands.</i>

55
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,462
<i>The ice is the soil
upon which plant life grows,</i>

56
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,674
<i>and the herds of grazers soon arrive.</i>

57
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,639
<i>Antarctic krill.</i>

58
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,479
<i>Trillions of them swarm
in the waters around Antarctica.</i>

59
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:47,568
<i>Protected by the ice above,
they graze on algae whilst the sun shines.</i>

60
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,953
<i>But the good times don't last long.</i>

61
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,501
<i>Once all the ice has melted,
the krill lose their protection,</i>

62
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,841
<i>and predators appear.</i>

63
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,480
<i>Penguins may have lost
their ability to fly,</i>

64
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,067
<i>but they still form flocks,
as so many birds do.</i>

65
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,831
<i>The longer they dive,</i>

66
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:44,750
<i>the longer it takes them
to catch their breath.</i>

67
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:57,013
<i>Ruffling their feathers traps air,
which makes their bodies more streamlined.</i>

68
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:01,475
<i>One last breath...</i>

69
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,897
<i>and the whole group dives down together.</i>

70
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:19,827
<i>The gentoos follow the krill
down to depths of over 200 meters.</i>

71
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,055
<i>What a flock can catch in one dive,</i>

72
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,184
<i>a giant traps in a single mouthful.</i>

73
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,496
<i>Humpback whales from the tropics</i>

74
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,249
<i>have traveled
over 8,000 kilometers to get here.</i>

75
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,006
<i>This one chooses to feed alone.</i>

76
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,730
<i>This technique, part lunge, part pounce,</i>

77
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:33,359
<i>only works when the krill
are close to the surface.</i>

78
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:40,533
<i>As more humpbacks arrive,
they begin to work in teams.</i>

79
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,254
<i>By lunging together,</i>

80
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:58,509
<i>the overspill from one huge mouth
is not lost but collected by another.</i>

81
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:44,430
<i>Some humpbacks regularly work
in an even more coordinated way.</i>

82
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,784
<i>They do so
when krill has descended to some depth.</i>

83
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,006
<i>Once in position,
they blast air from their blowholes.</i>

84
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,975
<i>Working together,</i>

85
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,395
<i>they create a curtain of bubbles
around their prey.</i>

86
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:46,867
<i>As the spiraling net tightens,
the krill are driven closer together,</i>

87
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:53,082
<i>and then the whales lunge upwards
and collect them.</i>

88
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,483
<i>Almost all humpback whales
in the southern hemisphere</i>

89
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,820
<i>come to the Antarctic to feed on krill.</i>

90
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:34,123
<i>Since the ban on commercial whaling,
their numbers have recovered dramatically,</i>

91
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,460
<i>but their food supply is now under threat.</i>

92
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,133
<i>In the last 50 years,</i>

93
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,678
<i>with warming temperatures
and disappearing sea ice,</i>

94
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,973
<i>krill stocks
in this part of the Southern Ocean</i>

95
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,058
<i>have more than halved.</i>

96
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:05,404
<i>Other sea hunters come here
seeking bigger prey than krill.</i>

97
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,125
<i>Antarctica's top predators.</i>

98
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,964
<i>Orca, killer whales.</i>

99
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:31,180
<i>Over half of the world's orca
patrol these polar seas.</i>

100
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:42,441
<i>This particular pod
specializes in hunting penguins.</i>

101
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,622
<i>They shift into stealth mode.</i>

102
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:09,051
<i>Hunting without making a sound,
so that their prey won't hear them coming.</i>

103
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,541
<i>A penguin can outmaneuver
a single killer whale,</i>

104
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,711
<i>but it can seldom escape a pod.</i>

105
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,323
<i>This hunt may seem cruel,</i>

106
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:19,288
<i>but important life skills
are being passed down the generations.</i>

107
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,729
<i>From killer whales to krill,</i>

108
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:49,568
<i>all life here ultimately depends
upon Antarctica's sea ice.</i>

109
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:13,592
<i>The seas that surround Antarctica
are the roughest on our planet.</i>

110
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,856
<i>These churning waters
draw up nutrients from the deep</i>

111
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:33,862
<i>and create vast, rich fishing grounds
for nomads like the wandering albatross.</i>

112
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,759
<i>Beneath the waves,
currents are flowing away from Antarctica,</i>

113
00:18:56,051 --> 00:19:00,347
<i>transporting nutrients across the planet,
fertilizing the oceans</i>

114
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,225
<i>and helping to regulate
global temperatures.</i>

115
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,880
<i>The island of South Georgia.</i>

116
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,677
<i>It's far enough north</i>

117
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,347
<i>to be beyond the reach of the sea ice
even in midwinter,</i>

118
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,101
<i>and many animals live here
the year round.</i>

119
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:09,833
<i>This wandering albatross chick
has been sitting on its nest all winter,</i>

120
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:15,380
<i>and is entirely dependent
on its parents returning with food.</i>

121
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:22,346
<i>It may have to wait a few days
between meals, or even a couple of weeks,</i>

122
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,266
<i>but at least
it's not the only one who's waiting.</i>

123
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,566
<i>Albatross chicks need to spend
a whole year growing</i>

124
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,277
<i>before they're ready
to take their first flight.</i>

125
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:50,332
<i>And then they spend several years at sea
before they return to land.</i>

126
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,643
<i>Coming in to land
on three-meter wings takes some practice.</i>

127
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,274
<i>Albatross don't have reverse thrusters.</i>

128
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,588
<i>The chick
is this female's first.</i>

129
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:47,431
<i>She's been raising it for six months,
and has another six to go.</i>

130
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,354
<i>Her chick is smaller than it should be,</i>

131
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:58,317
<i>a sign that her mate
has not been returning with food.</i>

132
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,196
<i>He may well have been
one of the many that die,</i>

133
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,158
<i>entangled on longline fishing lines.</i>

134
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:16,501
<i>South Georgia is an ideal place
for wanderers to raise their young,</i>

135
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,131
<i>but now fewer adults
are returning here to nest,</i>

136
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:22,883
<i>and in recent years,</i>

137
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:27,054
<i>the breeding population
has declined by 40 percent.</i>

138
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:38,815
<i>For now, waiting on its nest,
the chick is safe.</i>

139
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,652
<i>There are no land predators here.</i>

140
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,204
<i>But the same cannot be said
for South Georgia's seas.</i>

141
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:59,669
<i>Giant kelp flourishes
in these ice-free waters.</i>

142
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,471
<i>The perfect place for an ambush.</i>

143
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:22,776
<i>Leopard seals overwinter here
to escape Antarctica's frozen ocean.</i>

144
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,989
<i>They should have returned south by now,</i>

145
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,536
<i>but this year they've stayed longer.</i>

146
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,129
<i>And they've delayed their departure
for good reason.</i>

147
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,431
<i>There are king penguins here.</i>

148
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,147
<i>Each is a substantial meal,</i>

149
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:02,816
<i>if you can catch it.</i>

150
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,742
<i>Returning to feed their chicks,</i>

151
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,204
<i>the kings have no choice
but to run the gauntlet.</i>

152
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,423
<i>Kings rarely porpoise like this.</i>

153
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,804
<i>It uses more energy,
but it's faster than traveling underwater.</i>

154
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:19,142
<i>It's hard to select a moving target
in a panicking crowd,</i>

155
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,443
<i>but if there are stragglers,
the odds change.</i>

156
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:40,830
<i>Razor-sharp teeth versus a stabbing beak.</i>

157
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,655
<i>It's stalemate.</i>

158
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,659
<i>Both are exhausted after the chase.</i>

159
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,590
<i>The hunter decides that the meal
is not worth the fight.</i>

160
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,561
<i>For the penguin,
it was too close for comfort,</i>

161
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:49,357
<i>but that was just the first hurdle
in getting back to feed its chick.</i>

162
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,365
<i>It isn't going to be
a walk in the park.</i>

163
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,772
<i>Luckily, penguin is not on their menu.</i>

164
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,782
<i>Still, it's best
to let sleeping giants lie.</i>

165
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,757
<i>Elephant seal females
don't take kindly</i>

166
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,801
<i>to being disturbed from their slumber,</i>

167
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:03,306
<i>but it's the four-tonne males
you need to look out for.</i>

168
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,320
<i>They are fighting
for access to the females.</i>

169
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:30,709
<i>Getting bulldozed under angry blubber
is to be avoided at all costs.</i>

170
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,512
<i>An escape route.</i>

171
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,144
<i>Time to run for it.</i>

172
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,992
<i>At last, he's reached the nursery.
Now comes his final challenge.</i>

173
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,836
<i>Finding his chick
in the crowd of half a million.</i>

174
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,383
<i>He calls...</i>

175
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,729
<i>...and listens
for a recognizable reply.</i>

176
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,365
<i>His chick could be
another mile or two away,</i>

177
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,367
<i>at the back of the colony.</i>

178
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,624
<i>But that's the trouble with chicks.</i>

179
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,918
<i>They're never where you left them.</i>

180
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,547
<i>Astonishingly, in all this racket,</i>

181
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:03,551
<i>a parent and its chick
can recognize each other's calls.</i>

182
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:17,065
<i>The things parents go through
to deliver a meal.</i>

183
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,694
<i>If only they knew.</i>

184
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,079
<i>For such a small island,</i>

185
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,166
<i>South Georgia supports
an extraordinary quantity of life.</i>

186
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,174
<i>All these creatures
ultimately depend on the krill</i>

187
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,845
<i>that develops under the sea ice
around the Antarctic peninsula.</i>

188
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,391
<i>With sea ice disappearing,</i>

189
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:55,144
<i>so South Georgia's future
is far from certain.</i>

190
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:13,705
<i>At the other end of the planet,
in the north,</i>

191
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:18,877
<i>the effects of climate change
are being felt even more intensely.</i>

192
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,090
<i>The Arctic is not a continent
surrounded by sea</i>

193
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:28,261
<i>but a frozen ocean ringed by land.</i>

194
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:37,228
<i>Here, in spring, the sea ice
is still at its maximum extent.</i>

195
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:48,948
<i>It's a vast, firm hunting ground
for the planet's largest land carnivore.</i>

196
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,088
<i>A male polar bear
in search of his next meal</i>

197
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:08,551
<i>on the frozen fjords of Svalbard
in the high Arctic.</i>

198
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,893
<i>He's looking for seals,
which make up the bulk of his diet.</i>

199
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:28,488
<i>He must eat two-thirds
of the food he needs for the whole year</i>

200
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,117
<i>before the ice melts
and his hunting platform disappears.</i>

201
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:11,739
<i>The ringed seal mother had no choice
but to leave her pup alone on the surface.</i>

202
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,879
<i>In the past, she would have built a den
inside a ridge on the ice,</i>

203
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:32,427
<i>but now the sea freezes so late
that the ice is flat,</i>

204
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,389
<i>and she had to leave her pup
out in the open.</i>

205
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:51,237
<i>These changes in the ice
may benefit the bears for now,</i>

206
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,448
<i>but in the long term,</i>

207
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,909
<i>a crash in their most important prey
will follow.</i>

208
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,626
<i>This new, flatter ice
makes life difficult for the bears, too.</i>

209
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:10,423
<i>There's nowhere for them to hide
in order to creep up on a seal.</i>

210
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:20,141
<i>And for a mother with a young cub in tow,
being stealthy isn't easy.</i>

211
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,535
<i>The cub doesn't yet appreciate
the need for care</i>

212
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,206
<i>when sneaking up on a seal.</i>

213
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,127
<i>With fewer seals hiding in dens,</i>

214
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,756
<i>learning this pounding technique,
once so useful,</i>

215
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,425
<i>is now almost pointless.</i>

216
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:10,858
<i>Still, at least he's discovered
what a seal hole looks like..</i>

217
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:26,916
<i>His mother knows that overcast conditions
are good for hunting,</i>

218
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,837
<i>and he knows when she's serious.</i>

219
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,223
<i>Adult seals make a much better meal.</i>

220
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,238
<i>Her cub carefully treads in her footsteps,</i>

221
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,285
<i>and takes care not to break her outline.</i>

222
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,791
<i>Neither must put a foot wrong.</i>

223
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,176
<i>They must move as one.</i>

224
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,538
<i>Most seal hunts end in failure.</i>

225
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,215
<i>The bears must keep searching.</i>

226
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,554
<i>Her cub wanders off,</i>

227
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,850
<i>and gets another chance.</i>

228
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,447
<i>A seal pup alone on the ice.</i>

229
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:36,754
<i>Now it's not stealth
that is needed, but confidence.</i>

230
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,886
<i>There's nothing the mother can do,</i>

231
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:50,559
<i>except hope that the pup makes it
back to her hole in time.</i>

232
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,987
<i>The inexperienced young hunter
hesitates.</i>

233
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,873
<i>Its mother knows better.</i>

234
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,941
<i>Safe under the ice.</i>

235
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:50,536
<i>Polar bears are adaptable predators,
but they rely on sea ice.</i>

236
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:56,125
<i>If that disappears, so will the bears.</i>

237
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,768
<i>Summer at the ice edge
in the Canadian Arctic,</i>

238
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,189
<i>and the annual retreat of sea ice
is well underway.</i>

239
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,701
<i>As it melts, nomads arrive.</i>

240
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:54,433
<i>Narwhal, the origin of the unicorn legend.</i>

241
00:39:55,267 --> 00:40:01,190
<i>Their three-meter tusk is, in fact,
no more than an overgrown canine tooth,</i>

242
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:06,362
<i>but its exact function,
like so much about narwhals,</i>

243
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,948
<i>is still, in part, a mystery.</i>

244
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:18,374
<i>Each summer, narwhals travel
to the same part of the Arctic,</i>

245
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:23,129
<i>and patiently wait at the ice edge
for a crack to open up.</i>

246
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:30,136
<i>A lead in the ice,
wide enough for them to swim along.</i>

247
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,568
<i>Eventually, a crack appears.</i>

248
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,906
<i>Their passage to sheltered, shallow bays.</i>

249
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:16,849
<i>Narwhals are extremely timid
and rarely filmed underwater.</i>

250
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:49,340
<i>These ice whales eagerly travel
down the leads as soon as they open</i>

251
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:52,718
<i>because they're safer from predators
protected by the ice.</i>

252
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,439
<i>The leads may also give them access
to new feeding grounds.</i>

253
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,579
<i>Sea ice is not just crucial</i>

254
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,707
<i>to the lives of those creatures
that live around the poles.</i>

255
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:30,381
<i>It plays a vital role in determining
the climate of the whole planet.</i>

256
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,136
<i>A white surface keeps the earth cool</i>

257
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:40,307
<i>by reflecting most of the sun's energy
back into space.</i>

258
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,903
<i>A dark surface does the opposite,</i>

259
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:56,824
<i>absorbing over 90 percent
of the sun's energy</i>

260
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,826
<i>and so warming the earth.</i>

261
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,707
<i>As the sea ice shrinks,</i>

262
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:09,795
<i>we're starting to lose one of our planet's
protective white shields.</i>

263
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,384
<i>For thousands of years,</i>

264
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:19,430
<i>there's been a balance
in the advance and retreat of the sea ice,</i>

265
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,807
<i>but that is no longer the case.</i>

266
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,685
<i>Today, during the summer months,</i>

267
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:30,065
<i>there is 40 percent less sea ice cover
than there was in 1980.</i>

268
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:44,288
<i>The Arctic is warming twice as fast
as anywhere else on our planet.</i>

269
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:50,210
<i>By 2040, the ocean here
will be largely free of ice</i>

270
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,754
<i>during the summer months.</i>

271
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:14,193
<i>This loss of ice will inevitably
have devastating consequences</i>

272
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,737
<i>for all those that still depend on it.</i>

273
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,504
<i>The far northeastern coast
of Russia.</i>

274
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:55,651
<i>This is the largest gathering
of walrus on the planet.</i>

275
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:12,251
<i>Over a hundred thousand have hauled out
on one single beach.</i>

276
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:23,846
<i>They do so out of desperation,
not out of choice.</i>

277
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:31,186
<i>Their natural home is out on the sea ice.</i>

278
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:41,071
<i>But the ice has retreated
away to the north,</i>

279
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,368
<i>and this is the closest place
to their feeding grounds,</i>

280
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,036
<i>where they can find rest.</i>

281
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:05,929
<i>This calf must stay close to its mother.</i>

282
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,524
<i>But every square inch is occupied.</i>

283
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,880
<i>Climbing over
the tightly packed bodies</i>

284
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,382
<i>is the only way across the crowd.</i>

285
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,429
<i>Those beneath can get crushed to death.</i>

286
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:58,398
<i>A stampede can occur out of nowhere.</i>

287
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:25,717
<i>Under these conditions,
walruses are a danger to themselves.</i>

288
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:35,435
<i>Some manage to find space
away from the crowds.</i>

289
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,652
<i>They struggle up the 80-meter cliffs,</i>

290
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:54,788
<i>an extraordinary challenge
for a one-tonne animal used to sea ice.</i>

291
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:11,120
<i>At least up here
there's space to rest.</i>

292
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,385
<i>A walrus's eyesight
out of water is poor,</i>

293
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:26,153
<i>but they can sense the others down below.</i>

294
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,454
<i>As they get hungry,
they need to return to the sea.</i>

295
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,252
<i>In their desperation to do so,</i>

296
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,840
<i>hundreds fall from heights
they should never have scaled.</i>

297
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:36,616
<i>These mass gatherings of walrus
are now happening almost every year.</i>

298
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:49,421
<i>So the lives of walruses,
like those of polar bears and seals,</i>

299
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:50,714
<i>are changing.</i>

300
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:56,636
<i>All are living at the frontier
of climate change,</i>

301
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,391
<i>and all are suffering as a consequence.</i>

302
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:26,333
<i>For now, the Arctic winter returns
and the sea ice reforms.</i>

303
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,670
<i>Order is restored.</i>

304
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,262
<i>Relief for the many creatures
that depend on the ice.</i>

305
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,277
<i>But for how much longer</i>

306
00:51:54,653 --> 00:52:00,200
