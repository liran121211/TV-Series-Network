1
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,291
My enemy is near.

2
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:55,125
Give me the strength.

3
00:00:56,375 --> 00:01:00,958
Guide my hand to kill him
and return alive to kill those who remain.

4
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:06,416
May all evil omens, the dire cry of birds,

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,166
a malign conjunction of stars,
all evil dreams and angry words...

6
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,250
<i>Master?</i>

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,041
<i>A samurai is honorable.</i>

8
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,625
<i>You are no samurai.</i>

9
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:28,250
May they all be drained of power.

10
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,708
The ninth level.

11
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,208
Fowler.

12
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:51,250
Ninety-five, 96, 97, 98, 99.

13
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:26,666
Thick milk, long soured,
over old curds.

14
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,083
The best dairy on the Irish isle,
shared with you on our own.

15
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,583
I was raised on this.

16
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:36,708
Milk?

17
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,666
From a cow?

18
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,083
I shipped in two beeves special
to feed my honored guest.

19
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:58,601
Hm.

20
00:07:58,625 --> 00:08:02,250
A good... sourness.

21
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,208
I never tire
of your people's aversion to impoliteness.

22
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:13,750
A taboo against offense,
even as you plan the death of thousands.

23
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:19,416
Surely... not so many need to die.

24
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,333
Anyone who stands in the way.
Anyone not on their knees when it's over.

25
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,250
Your guns will be ready?

26
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:30,833
They are all ready.

27
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:34,208
Already ready. Ready for all.

28
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:38,250
All we need are loyal men
ready to fire them.

29
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,708
You ask Master Chiba

30
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,625
to wager his excellent position
as advisor to the shogun.

31
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,666
The risks are great.

32
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,583
Thousands of men
guard the shogun's castle.

33
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:48,958
Ten thousand.

34
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:52,041
Twenty. It doesn't matter.

35
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,666
They guard it with knives.

36
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,916
No one makes
a better blade than your people.

37
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:02,208
No one invents
better ways to kill people than mine.

38
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,833
A gun will never
be as beautiful as a sword.

39
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:11,500
But with a gun,
you can take any sword you want.

40
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:17,125
The shogun and his entire family
will be dead come spring.

41
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,916
And Master Chiba

42
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,666
will be the right hand
of our appointed man...

43
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,333
That was tasteless of me.

44
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,375
Our men are trained and eager to serve.

45
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:35,625
Each one hates the shogun
with all the blood in his heart.

46
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,875
Oh, I don't hate the shogun.

47
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,250
I just want his chair.

48
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,375
It's him.

49
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:49,916
He's come.

50
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,375
I told you he'd come.

51
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,333
I want to watch.

52
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,541
Why set traps
only to mash the rat yourself?

53
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,541
Sit, we have business.

54
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:05,625
I want to watch.

55
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:59,750
But you know what's next. My flowers.

56
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,458
It won't be enough.

57
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,041
Fine.

58
00:17:04,916 --> 00:17:06,416
Send your giant.

59
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,041
<i>You will
get yourself killed.</i>

60
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,125
<i>You are a monster.</i>

61
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,333
<i>No one can know you're hiding.</i>

62
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,500
<i>I thought you had to be something special.</i>

63
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,791
<i>Go ahead.</i>

64
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:23,208
<i>Just jump.</i>

65
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,875
<i>It felt... dark.</i>

66
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,791
Master?

67
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,125
Master?

68
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:21,291
Ringo?

69
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:33,916
Mizu!

70
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:37,583
Mizu?

71
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:43,625
Taigen.

72
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,166
That's...

73
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That's my scarf.

74
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,375
Taigen.

75
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,375
Are you real?

76
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
I think so.

77
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,750
Can you walk?

78
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,458
Might be slow.

79
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,333
This is up.

80
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,666
Down is that way.

81
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,041
- Out is...
- We're not leaving.

82
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:29,375
We're going to the ninth level.

83
00:23:31,166 --> 00:23:32,541
I have a man to kill.

84
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:36,625
I hate you.

85
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:50,375
Tea party.

86
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,041
I'll help.

87
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:13,625
No one gets to kill you, but...

88
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:36,041
Put me back in the dungeon.

89
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:35,875
<i>♪ For whom the bell tolls ♪</i>

90
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:55,250
<i>I am not afraid.</i>

91
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,875
<i>My whole life has been a battle.</i>

92
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:12,000
<i>An apprentice
would never leave his master's side.</i>

93
00:26:16,125 --> 00:26:17,583
<i>I'll avenge us, Mama.</i>

94
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:19,958
<i>I swear it.</i>

95
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,750
Hate... you.

96
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:27,583
He's nowhere. He disappeared!

97
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:28,750
I told you.

98
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,291
I said this samurai could not be stopped,
but you wouldn't listen.

99
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,333
Just a man. Let him come.

100
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,541
Perhaps we should
excuse ourselves from their danger.

101
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,625
What danger?

102
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,000
An attack on the shogun's emissary
is an attack on the shogun himself.

103
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:48,416
No one would dare
attack them with us here.

104
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Yes.

105
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,291
That's true.

106
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,000
Abijah Fowler.

107
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,166
Where is he?

108
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
You see?

109
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:44,583
No one murders so well as the British.

110
00:29:45,833 --> 00:29:47,541
It's our number one export.

111
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,416
Look at you.

112
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,791
No one's ever made it up
half this far before.

113
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:03,250
How did you like our monkeys?

114
00:30:05,541 --> 00:30:07,208
Oh, you found your friend.

115
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:09,041
He was stupidly loyal.

116
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,416
And he wouldn't tell us a thing about you.

117
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:22,083
Not even to save his fingernails.

118
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:36,791
You came all this way... for me?

119
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,666
Because of what I just may be to you?

120
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:41,291
May be.

121
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:44,666
I thought I accounted
for all my bastards over the years.

122
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,708
They line the tunnel you came in.

123
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:50,333
All those half-breeds, like you.

124
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:52,000
I'll kill you.

125
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:54,916
All four of you.

126
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,750
I see.

127
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:02,458
Who was it?

128
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:05,375
I heard something happened to old Violet.

129
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,041
Was that you?

130
00:31:09,375 --> 00:31:10,833
For Violet.

131
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,416
Are you still alive?

132
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:34,625
Why?

133
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:50,333
<i>I know what I'm supposed to do.
Be a samurai, like you.</i>

134
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:58,833
Okay.

135
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,541
I'll teach you.
