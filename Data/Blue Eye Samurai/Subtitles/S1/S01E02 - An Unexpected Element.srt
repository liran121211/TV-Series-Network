1
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:16,791
00:37:02:17

2
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,583
The last of it.

3
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:37,166
Who knew one man could bleed so much?

4
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:41,416
You're better at cleaning than cooking.
When does your son get back?

5
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,083
The Four Fangs!

6
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,375
What an honor!
May I get you something to eat?

7
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,375
A samurai came through here.

8
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,083
Young. Arrogant.

9
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,625
He cut four fingers to get a name.

10
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,666
- Tell me what you know.
- Shut up.

11
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:18,666
We're trying to eat.

12
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:41,250
He was here two days ago.
He spilled blood everywhere.

13
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:43,666
Which is fine.

14
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:48,541
Then he left.
And he took my son, an invalid.

15
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,791
That's it! That's it!

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh!

17
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,791
You move quietly for someone so large.

18
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,875
I'm naturally stealthy.

19
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,541
Maybe not naturally. My father beat me
if I ever made noise in the noodle shop.

20
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,916
I learned to be quiet like a ninja.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,083
I don't want you
anywhere near me.

22
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,916
- Stay away.
- Stay away, Ringo.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,083
I don't care.

24
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,916
But I'm useful. You see?

25
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,958
I heard white people's skin
burns off in the sun.

26
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,806
Is it true blue eyes can see in the dark?

27
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:08,291
Oh, and is it true white people drink milk
from their animals?

28
00:03:08,375 --> 00:03:09,375
Hmm.

29
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:12,583
I know why you think you don't want
me around, but you can trust me.

30
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:14,583
I'd never tell your secret. Not ever.

31
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,625
Not if someone
bit off my skin bite by bite

32
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,750
or even if they made me eat eggplant.

33
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,583
I'd never ever, ever, ever
tell anyone that you're a girl.

34
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,041
If I see you again,

35
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,541
I will kill you
and never think of you again.

36
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:51,000
Come forward. Get in line!

37
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,000
No one gets through without a travel pass.

38
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,083
Next.

39
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:59,208
Come on, come on. Let's see your pass.

40
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,291
Next!

41
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,166
Come on.

42
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:07,333
What is this? A bribe?

43
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,500
Are you trying to bribe me?
Arrest him and flog him!

44
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,333
No!

45
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,375
No! Please!

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,541
Hey, where's your pass?

47
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,125
Right here.

48
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,916
Travel pass for two.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,541
Just us two boys
traveling together, like always.

50
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,708
Heading to my buckwheat dealer.
Fresh shipment from Horokanai.

51
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,625
The best! Come on, you.

52
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,583
My apprentice. He's a bit dim.

53
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,250
Next.

54
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,000
Useful! I told you.

55
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:02,083
You will not find
what you seek at my side.

56
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,500
I am owed my revenge,
and I will have it at any cost.

57
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,000
Huh! I love revenge.

58
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,958
It is a demon's path littered with death.

59
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500
I'm not afraid.
I can train, and I can help you.

60
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,291
I'm already the greatest in the world
at one thing. What's one more?

61
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,625
Noodles is not war.

62
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,583
My whole life has been a battle.

63
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:37,791
I'm an apprentice!

64
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,090
So, where do we go
to get your revenge?

65
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:42,875
I need a boat.

66
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:47,208
Ooh! A revenge boat.

67
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:06,166
Argh!

68
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,833
It's not so bad.

69
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:12,250
You can shave the front.
It's how all the noblemen wear their hair.

70
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,666
Very fashionable.

71
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,833
Why didn't he just kill me?

72
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,125
- The gods have shown you a longer path.
- Ugh.

73
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,291
You still have me.

74
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,125
- We'll be married, and...
- Your father will never allow it now.

75
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,208
I can convince my father.

76
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,208
And have everyone mock me?

77
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,416
I'd rather cut myself open now.

78
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,583
The cut is so clean.

79
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,208
A masterful cut.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,291
You can't kill yourself
over a brawl with some monster.

81
00:06:42,375 --> 00:06:43,875
It... It wasn't even a duel.

82
00:06:43,958 --> 00:06:46,958
It was an attack.
Did he officially challenge you?

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Victory cannot come from dishonor.

84
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,416
Therefore, you never lost.

85
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,583
Had he challenged you, he'd be dead.

86
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:11,208
I can see it now. You challenge him.

87
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,375
And like a dog, he comes running.

88
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,208
He faces you.

89
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,166
An <i>onryō.</i> His demon eyes.

90
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:23,250
But your courage drives him back
like a squall against the sea.

91
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,083
You unsheathe your magnificent sword.

92
00:07:32,666 --> 00:07:33,708
Akemi.

93
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,458
- Are you sure?
- Shh.

94
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,458
He lunges at you,

95
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:48,916
but his sword is no match for yours.

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,666
You strike with your blade.

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,833
You draw his blood.

98
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:02,458
His eyes like two angry waves in a storm.

99
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,500
They try to suck you in,
but you're too strong.

100
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,666
You thrust your sword into him again.

101
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,625
And again. And again.

102
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,041
A final cut.

103
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,291
You feel the hot spray of blood.

104
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,000
Glory!

105
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,416
Mm.

106
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,458
Come now. Let's shave your head.

107
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,625
No.

108
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:50,916
You're right.

109
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,291
That monster didn't fight honorably.

110
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,625
So my honor can still be restored.

111
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,666
I must find him.

112
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:03,166
Challenge him and kill him for all to see.

113
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,875
But we're supposed to marry.
You can't leave.

114
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,083
He could be anywhere.
It could take months to find him.

115
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:13,208
He's looking for Heiji Shindo.
Arrogant enough to go straight to him.

116
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,833
He'll need a boat.

117
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,458
Mihonoseki.

118
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,000
He must have left a trail.

119
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,500
But what if he kills you this time?

120
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,583
Boom, there was blood everywhere.

121
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:40,083
And that's why
I vowed never to eat eggplant again.

122
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,708
So, tell me about this boat.

123
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,250
I've never been on a boat.
I wonder if I'll get seasick.

124
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,666
I get nauseous in the bath
if I slosh too much.

125
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:49,958
Ahh!

126
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,208
Naturally stealthy.

127
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,000
You don't have to be here.

128
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:57,208
And miss you killing Heiji Shindo?

129
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,291
Not him.

130
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:02,833
The white man he protects.
He's on an island in the west.

131
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:08,041
By sea, I can be there before dawn
and kill him by sunrise.

132
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,875
Revenge.

133
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,875
Where is everybody?

134
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,083
Hello?

135
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,750
Where did your town go?

136
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,166
Ah!

137
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,750
We're not here for fun.
We're here for a boat.

138
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,750
Sure, I can take you there.

139
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,713
- Thank you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

140
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,541
Not now. Tomorrow.

141
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,875
Not too early either.

142
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,500
I must leave now.

143
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,041
During the Hadaka Matsuri?
Well, then you'll have to swim.

144
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:47,125
Everyone's closed today!
We have to purify ourselves

145
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,041
and celebrate the kami,
or we'll have a bad year.

146
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:52,250
You don't want a bad year, do you?

147
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,291
Fine. Tomorrow then.

148
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,750
That's the spirit. Have fun!

149
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,291
Stay for the Shingi.

150
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,666
A dip in the ice cleanses the soul.
You don't wanna miss that.

151
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,875
And when you hear the drums, come running.

152
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:14,916
We will see you in the morning.

153
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,916
Not too early!

154
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,666
Sorry. Stealthy.

155
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,416
You do that a lot.

156
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:28,476
There has to be something
you'd like to do while we wait.

157
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,875
Gambling? We could try their noodles!

158
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,625
The Shingi!
He said we don't wanna miss that.

159
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,125
Your foot.

160
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,291
You are never to take that off.

161
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,208
The day you take that off,
you are discharged from your duties.

162
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:49,583
Do you understand?

163
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,166
I will use the time to train.

164
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,416
You need to train? I've seen you fight.

165
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,583
Right. You can never train too much.

166
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:05,958
It's good we miss all the fun.
No fun for samurai. Fun is bad.

167
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,875
I'll set camp on the eastern cliffs.

168
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:12,125
Ringo, you should stay here and have fun.

169
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,125
For as long as you want. Forever even.

170
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,333
There's no shame in making a home here
and keeping your life.

171
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:22,833
Uh-uh. An apprentice
would never leave his master's side.

172
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:26,000
Just a little fun. Then tomorrow...

173
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,500
Whoo-hoo.

174
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:00,666
Your cut.

175
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,250
You did leave me a trail.

176
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:13,083
Let him through. Let him through.

177
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,958
Take arms! Lock the gate!

178
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:21,958
The messengers were supposed
to light a fire when the samurai is dead.

179
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,750
You pay money
for a job you don't wanna think about,

180
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:28,125
so you don't have to think about it.

181
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,500
It's the whole point of money.

182
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:34,000
Not everyone can be relied on.

183
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,083
I'm familiar with that premise.

184
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:43,666
Every year, I promise you
delights beyond imagination.

185
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:46,416
Every year, I deliver.

186
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:50,208
My imagination expands.

187
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,625
The spring pilgrimage
is the one time of year

188
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,083
I'm allowed off this fucking island.

189
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,250
I've been planning all month. Hm.

190
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,791
Surprises for you
every stop along the way to Edo.

191
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,583
Hmm. And when we get to Edo?

192
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:09,541
Our surprise for the shogun
is almost ready.

193
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:13,875
After that,
you'll be free to go anywhere you like.

194
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,041
Anytime you like.

195
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,125
Hm.

196
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,166
Done.

197
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:30,791
Hmm. After all these years,

198
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,750
you've mastered the brush.

199
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,208
I hate painting.

200
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:40,125
And woodblock and ceramic

201
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:44,875
and calligraphy
and every other useless art

202
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,208
I mastered to while away the hours.

203
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,083
I hate that I have time for painting.

204
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,166
If I have time to paint,
something is wrong.

205
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,416
The shogun lets us operate
so long as he can deny I exist.

206
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,333
Soon he won't have that luxury.

207
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:05,041
Hmm. I'd have liked that in my room.

208
00:18:24,541 --> 00:18:27,208
A sword made by your hand is beyond price.

209
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:31,625
Hmm. Yet there is a price.

210
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,375
Take all I have. Please.

211
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,916
I must have a sword made by your hand.

212
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:39,166
Hmm.

213
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:42,250
I am not a swordsman. I bind books.

214
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,708
I was taught my trade by...

215
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,500
my father.

216
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,416
He was killed by a drunk ronin,

217
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:52,125
who cut my father down
for splashing him with his cart.

218
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,541
This ronin is a drunk,

219
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,500
but he is skilled as I am not.

220
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,375
He will kill me. I know this.

221
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,583
But with a sword from you, Master,

222
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,875
I can take his life as he takes mine.

223
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,041
And die avenged.

224
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:07,875
Hmm.

225
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,250
Will you make him a blade?

226
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,458
He's hiding something.

227
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:29,791
Hmm.

228
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:32,291
His tale is moving.

229
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,833
Perhaps we can help him die with honor.

230
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:38,083
Light the fire.

231
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:40,625
You take up the hammer.

232
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,541
Your fire is in this edge, Mizu.

233
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,041
It's ready.

234
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,833
Your breath is late.

235
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:34,916
Like so.

236
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,000
Come on now, boy.

237
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,666
Your foot announces your thoughts.

238
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,500
Huh. You're soft for a boy.

239
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,833
Mixed breeds are all weak stock.

240
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,541
Thicker at the spine,
thin at the edge.

241
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:07,416
The <i>hamon</i> will show
where soft and hard steel blend.

242
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:10,958
It's time for the <i>yaki-ire.</i>

243
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:21,625
The <i>yaki-ire</i> is when metal is reborn,

244
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,916
and the soul enters the sword.

245
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,291
{\an8}All must be pure for the sword to be pure.

246
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:36,458
{\an8}The metal, the maker, the one to wield it.

247
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:40,666
{\an8}Mizu. Is your mind clear?

248
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,416
{\an8}It is.

249
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,416
{\an8}Mizu. Is your soul at rest?

250
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:52,875
{\an8}It is.

251
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:19,833
What color?

252
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:23,625
The summer sun just touched the horizon.

253
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Mizu.

254
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,333
Your edge.

255
00:24:13,916 --> 00:24:15,250
How could this happen?

256
00:24:15,333 --> 00:24:17,333
Forgive my failure.

257
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,916
An unexpected element entered the blade.

258
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:24,458
If I find what it is,
the sword can be repaired and re-immersed.

259
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:27,666
The fault is mine. The element is me.

260
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:32,708
The fault is mine.

261
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,375
I believed your story.
This is not the hand of a bookbinder.

262
00:24:37,875 --> 00:24:40,250
This hand has taken many lives.

263
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,916
An assassin's hand.

264
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,208
You're a fool.

265
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:49,000
I've taken more than many lives.

266
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:51,000
They call me Bloodsoaked Chiaki!

267
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:56,125
And I've made a fortune.
With this, I'll make a thousand fortunes.

268
00:24:56,708 --> 00:25:01,000
The assassin who carries
Master Eiji's broken blade.

269
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:07,625
A soul like that is drowned in blood.

270
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,458
There is no stopping them.

271
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:12,625
They will always find their broken blade.

272
00:25:13,416 --> 00:25:15,958
We can only mind our own soul, Mizu.

273
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:38,208
You're a mess.

274
00:27:38,291 --> 00:27:40,125
Your father is calling for you.

275
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:42,625
He insists on your finest.

276
00:27:42,708 --> 00:27:43,791
Get dressed.

277
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:25,833
Hmm.

278
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:28,083
She's as you promised.

279
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,166
Yes, lovely.

280
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,958
A bit old,
but many good years left.

281
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:38,625
Oh yes. Very fertile.
Cycles in precise rhythm with the moon.

282
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,666
And, of course,
her purity is strictly guarded.

283
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,416
How fortuitous for you
Lord Miyabe's daughter turned out

284
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,208
to be so ugly.

285
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,458
And how fortuitous for us yours didn't.

286
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:51,625
Of course.

287
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,416
As the shogun's counselor,

288
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:57,125
the Tokunobu clan was not my first choice

289
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,125
for an alliance by marriage.

290
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:02,166
But your proximity to several key <i>hans</i>

291
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:06,000
and your profound ambition... Yes.

292
00:29:06,083 --> 00:29:10,541
She will make a suitable new wife
to the shogun's younger son.

293
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,541
May the gods bless
the shogun's wise and noble counselor.

294
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:18,291
A spring wedding would be auspicious.

295
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:22,375
The boy's first wife
was not an affectionate match.

296
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:25,541
The boy is... eager.

297
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:32,833
{\an8}If you permit,
I offer engagement gifts for,

298
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,416
um... hmm...

299
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:37,250
Akemi.

300
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,333
Hmm.

301
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,083
An <i>ohaguro</i> set.

302
00:29:57,166 --> 00:30:00,458
To blacken your teeth like a proper bride.

303
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:03,333
The master prefers black pearls to white.

304
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:14,166
Father! Father, please!

305
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,083
Please, you can't marry me off like this!

306
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:20,875
Sent away!
Away from you. Away from Taigen.

307
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,416
Taigen. There's rust on his blade now.

308
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,875
I was foolish to consider him for you,
but I've secured a suitable match.

309
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:30,791
More than suitable. Kissed by the gods.

310
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:33,333
I can't. Seki, tell him.

311
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,541
It is the best option for you.

312
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,416
I won't do it. I won't.

313
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:42,458
You do not try
to change my mind this time!

314
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:45,291
You are not the hero
of this family's story.

315
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:48,000
I raised the Tokunobu name from nothing.

316
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:51,000
From nothing to the shogun's chambers.

317
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,958
I did!

318
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:59,291
Stupid girl.
Too stupid to see.

319
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,875
I am giving you an opportunity.

320
00:31:03,208 --> 00:31:05,958
The shogun is expecting
Master Chiba to return to Edo

321
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:07,833
with a new bride for his son.

322
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:10,291
We leave in five days.

323
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,958
Don't forget your teeth.

324
00:31:39,166 --> 00:31:41,125
Shh. Quiet.

325
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:44,916
Seki.

326
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:47,875
Just in time! I'm seeing the silkman.

327
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:50,250
He just got his new shipment.
Freshly dyed.

328
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:51,541
At night?

329
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,958
If we're to leave
for a wedding in five days,

330
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,583
there isn't a night to spare.

331
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,000
I adore his silks. I'll ride with you.

332
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,958
Why didn't you stand up for me?

333
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:10,708
Because your father's mind
cannot be changed when it is set.

334
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:13,541
Any more than yours. For example,

335
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:17,291
when you seem set on
what is clearly a bad decision,

336
00:32:17,375 --> 00:32:19,333
like running away.

337
00:32:19,416 --> 00:32:21,916
You think I don't know you, child?

338
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,916
I brushed your teeth.

339
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,083
I won't be locked away
in Edo married to a stranger.

340
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:30,208
I can fix everything.
I just have to find Taigen.

341
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:33,208
On your own? On the open road?

342
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:36,958
You'll get your throat cut by brigands
before you find anyone,

343
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:39,541
if your father doesn't find you first.

344
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:43,250
In which case,
you're better off with the brigands.

345
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,125
What choice do I have?

346
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,708
You can share a bed
with an heir of the shogun.

347
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:50,125
Any woman would die for the chance.

348
00:32:50,208 --> 00:32:51,208
Let them.

349
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:54,208
That kind of man
treats women like animals.

350
00:32:54,291 --> 00:32:55,708
They say he's a tyrant.

351
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:59,208
What man isn't?

352
00:33:00,083 --> 00:33:01,083
You.

353
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,208
Add my trunk with hers.

354
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:15,041
Now, get in and shut the door.

355
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:18,666
If we're running away,
let's at least do it warm.

356
00:33:48,916 --> 00:33:52,208
Every day for a thousand years,

357
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:57,083
we have offered prayers at the tree
from which the <i>shingi</i> are made.

358
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:00,625
Their fibers are filled
with the kami's breath.

359
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,708
Who shall win their power this year?

360
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,208
Power?

361
00:34:05,291 --> 00:34:06,625
They're sacred.

362
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,583
The priestess throws them in the water.

363
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:12,000
Whoever gets them,
their fondest wish comes true.

364
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:14,708
Ooh! Magic sticks.

365
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:18,000
Uh-uh-uh. Don't even think about it. Mine.

366
00:34:18,083 --> 00:34:21,791
I'm getting my wish this year.
A new husband.

367
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,208
Huh?

368
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:27,583
Noodles!

369
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,750
Whoa!

370
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,041
So, how are your noodles? Anything great?

371
00:34:37,125 --> 00:34:38,833
Second best in town.

372
00:34:38,916 --> 00:34:41,750
Used to be the best,
then last year, Rinji caught the <i>shingi,</i>

373
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,958
and all of a sudden,
his noodles are magic.

374
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,750
Still, second best.

375
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:47,833
Hmm.

376
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,333
This is... This is incredible!

377
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:08,000
The bounce of the noodle.
The balance of flavor! And your spices!

378
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,250
Is that <i>shiso?</i>

379
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:12,250
Where did you find <i>shiso</i>
this time of year?

380
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,750
Huh. Thanks.

381
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:16,416
Hardly get any compliments
since Rinji surpassed me.

382
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,375
His are better than this?

383
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:25,333
Transcendent.

384
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:29,583
Beyond. I never imagined
such flavor was even possible.

385
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,833
I thought I was the best.

386
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:36,625
Compared to these,
my noodles are like worms.

387
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:39,333
Slimy worms in a scummy pond.

388
00:35:39,416 --> 00:35:41,791
I'm not even good
at what I thought I was great at.

389
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:45,375
Maybe this is why master told me to stay.

390
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:49,250
If you love my noodles so much,
want a job? Dishes are piling up.

391
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,750
I'll teach you.

392
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:52,541
You mean stay here?

393
00:35:52,625 --> 00:35:54,208
You got somewhere better to be?

394
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:56,583
Huh.

395
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:27,166
Tomorrow, he dies.

396
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:52,208
Huh. The drums.
Maybe I'll just go look at the fun.

397
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:21,416
I don't know you, and we have no dispute.

398
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,583
You have enemies now.
Rich ones. You can take off those things.

399
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:30,416
We know what they hide.
We know who you are.

400
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:34,916
All Kyoto is talking
about the unnamed samurai

401
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,125
who cut through Shindo Dojo.

402
00:37:44,208 --> 00:37:45,625
I have a name.

403
00:37:46,125 --> 00:37:49,208
No one will ever know it.

404
00:38:17,916 --> 00:38:19,375
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

405
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:23,375
What's everyone doing?

406
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:27,583
Being reborn.
What're you waiting for? Whoo!

407
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:54,333
Dojos fight to boast.
Warriors fight to kill.

408
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,208
Whoo-hoo!

409
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,208
Whoa! Ahh!

410
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:31,000
Each year,

411
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:34,833
<i>we come scorched by ire and affliction.</i>

412
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:41,541
<i>Let these waters quench
our parched souls</i>

413
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:43,583
<i>and bring us good fortune.</i>

414
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:48,958
But only one of you
gets your fondest wish.

415
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:51,000
Make your wish now.

416
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:58,208
I wish to be great at something.

417
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:04,833
Ahh!

418
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:16,375
Husband!

419
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:20,666
No!

420
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:38,333
You may actually deserve
my true blade.

421
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,583
That sword

422
00:42:45,916 --> 00:42:46,916
is stolen.

423
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:52,958
Still soft.

424
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:15,583
I don't deserve death by an impure hand.

425
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:18,583
Goodbye, Bloodsoaked Chiaki.

426
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:02,708
I am owed my honor.

427
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:04,291
{\an8}Then take it.
