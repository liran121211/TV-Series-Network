1
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:37,416
No one man can defeat an army,

2
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,875
but one creature can.

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,333
How does such a creature come to be?

4
00:00:46,708 --> 00:00:51,791
Long before our great shogun
ordained the sun to rise...

5
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:56,750
...there lived a ronin.

6
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:08,000
Seared into his soul was the day his lord...

7
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:12,625
...was assassinated by a rival clan

8
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:16,583
whose crest was the phoenix.

9
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:26,666
On that day,

10
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,833
he felt something rise within him.

11
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:34,375
A storm in his soul.

12
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,541
Kill everyone, then burn it down.

13
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:09,500
<i>A hate that radiated
from deep in his heart</i>

14
00:02:11,125 --> 00:02:13,250
<i>to the tip of his sword.</i>

15
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:38,666
Master.

16
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,375
Get everyone to the cellar.

17
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:43,500
You have murdered us all.

18
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,541
Ringo, stand guard over them.

19
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,208
I don't have a weapon.

20
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,500
Start with a kitchen knife.

21
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,625
Come on! This way, this way.

22
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,708
<i>The ronin returned home to his village...</i>

23
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,875
where his parents implored him
to begin a new life.

24
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,666
But hate is like a typhoon.

25
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,125
<i>It begins as a breeze at sea...</i>

26
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,375
Mama.

27
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,875
No one can find us.

28
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:09,833
<i>...that is swallowed by darkness.</i>

29
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,166
Bad men are looking for you, Mizu.

30
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,333
For a girl.

31
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:17,541
You must be a boy, always a boy.

32
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,166
<i>Then deepens. Energizes.</i>

33
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,875
I'll avenge us, Mama. I swear it.

34
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,416
<i>And grows ever stronger.</i>

35
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,625
<i>Swirling and raging</i>

36
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:43,250
<i>until it is ready to strike!</i>

37
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,666
<i>The ronin set on his quest,</i>

38
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,875
<i>vowing to cleanse the Earth
of all who wore the phoenix crest</i>

39
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,458
<i>or shared their blood.</i>

40
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:57,916
<i>But he would soon learn</i>

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,541
<i>the demon's path
is paved with sharp stone.</i>

42
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,208
Do you have a death wish?

43
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,875
Now they have to get through both of us.

44
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,583
You're the bravest princess I've ever met.

45
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm not brave.

46
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,875
I've been a captive my whole life.

47
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:04,291
If I die today, I die free.

48
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,125
Excuse me.

49
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,166
I'm told opium from the West is sold here.

50
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,000
I want to find
the white men who supply it.

51
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:56,250
I seek no trouble, only information.

52
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:05,041
It looks like you do want trouble.

53
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,625
No, I only want to ask...

54
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:16,125
You half-breed piece of shit.

55
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:43,916
<i>The ronin's soul grew weary
and his body ill.</i>

56
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,416
<i>He did not fear death,</i>

57
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,875
<i>only that he might die
before fulfilling his vow.</i>

58
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,166
Help me.

59
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,500
Please. I need a doctor.

60
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:10,041
<i>All seemed hopeless</i>

61
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,583
<i>until...</i>

62
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:23,000
<i>...the ronin saw a vision
as if sent from the gods.</i>

63
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,708
Help me.

64
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,708
Mister, come with me.

65
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,500
A few coins, and I'll show you heaven.

66
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,625
Can you help me?

67
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:14,416
Mama, you... you're alive.

68
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Mizu.

69
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,208
The beautiful woman
took the ronin home with her.

70
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:34,416
And for the first time in many moons,

71
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,916
<i>the ronin rested.</i>

72
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,458
Mama, you're alive.

73
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,250
How?

74
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,875
Medicine for my headaches.

75
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh.

76
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,708
Eat up, then I have to go back to work.

77
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,916
You must never do that again.
I earned money, more than enough.

78
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,916
Ah. How honorable you grew up to be.

79
00:10:30,875 --> 00:10:34,041
I knew it'd be hard on you,
thinking me dead,

80
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,958
but I knew it was for the best.

81
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,833
Being on your own,
you could be like water.

82
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,333
Impossible to catch.

83
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,166
Now the gods have brought you back to me.

84
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,000
The ronin
regained his strength,

85
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,916
ready to return to his journey of hate.

86
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,500
The woman beseeched him to stay.

87
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:05,333
The ronin told her of his vow,
a vow he could not break.

88
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:11,375
Desperate, the woman recalled
something taught to her long ago.

89
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:46,458
The money is gone.

90
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,375
Don't worry about money.
Don't worry about anything.

91
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,916
I have the answer to all our prayers.

92
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,791
I found you a husband.

93
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:09,333
He's an outcast,
so your looks are no matter.

94
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:13,250
He's getting old and needs
a strong woman to help him with chores.

95
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,541
Out of the question. I made my vow.

96
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,833
What woman doesn't want
a man to take care of her?

97
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,666
Of her mother?

98
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,708
The men who hunted you as a child
think you died in that fire.

99
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:30,166
If anyone found out you were alive,
they could turn you in for a great bounty.

100
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,333
Let them. I am nobody's wife.

101
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:53,625
I'm off to work now.

102
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,625
We need the money.

103
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,083
You see, I'd do anything for you.

104
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,083
You're going to love the mountains!

105
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,125
No other soul will ever see you.

106
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,291
You'll have to work, of course.

107
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,083
Cooking, cleaning,
helping out with the horses.

108
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:33,875
Change your clothes.
He raises horses for the lord.

109
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:38,000
Mikio was a great samurai
until he transgressed.

110
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,208
Transgressed?

111
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,958
Oh, lords execute their men
if they tie a belt wrong.

112
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,750
The point is, you're both outcasts.

113
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:50,708
He has money and is in no position
to complain about your face.

114
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:52,291
Makeup.

115
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,791
Hmm.

116
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,333
You're not as hideous as I expected.

117
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:42,333
You're much older than I expected.

118
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,250
Might as well get this over with.

119
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:53,791
His loyalty was no longer
to his slain lord nor to revenge...

120
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,875
...but... to his bride.

121
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,583
Okay, back to work.

122
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,000
Let's get you ready for tonight.

123
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,875
Mizu can't possibly hold them all off.

124
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:35,916
I'm not a brute.

125
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,458
What do we have here?

126
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:02,250
They cornered the samurai upstairs.

127
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,166
Let's steal a little fun for us.

128
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,375
You little son of a bitch!

129
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,416
Stay here. Keep watch.

130
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,750
Whoa.

131
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,333
Easy. Easy.

132
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,166
That's okay. That's okay.

133
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You can trust me.

134
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:05,833
Shh.

135
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,000
Stay away from the horses!

136
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,833
Hmm.

137
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,333
Well, back to work.

138
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,541
Who is this one?

139
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,041
Name's Kai.

140
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,333
Beautiful, but a beast.

141
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,291
Been trying to break her for months.

142
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,750
Hmm.

143
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,125
This is what Kai thinks of me.

144
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:48,791
Ever since I was banished by my lord,
I've held onto this... fantasy

145
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:52,708
that if I bring him the perfect creature,
he will welcome me back.

146
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,958
Hmm. It's silly.

147
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,833
Yes, it is.

148
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,416
Hmm.

149
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:40,916
Can I feed Kai?

150
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,500
Oh.

151
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Can you ride?

152
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:31,750
Wake up! Wake up!

153
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,833
Come on! Come on!

154
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,333
Go... fast.

155
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:43,458
Too fast! You're going too fast!

156
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,416
I'll get you a ripe one.

157
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,375
Impressive.

158
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:18,666
You try.

159
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:24,625
Come on, I'll show you.
Hold your hand back.

160
00:23:25,875 --> 00:23:27,875
Aim for that one right there.

161
00:23:34,916 --> 00:23:36,333
Not bad for a first try.

162
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,833
As time passed...

163
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:51,541
the ronin and the bride
enjoyed their simple life.

164
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:54,250
The demon's path
seemed like a distant dream.

165
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:59,375
Though sometimes, if he stopped to listen,

166
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,708
the ronin could still hear it

167
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,708
calling his... name.

168
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,708
Mama, are you sure
you can go into town like that?

169
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:25,125
Once I get my medicine, I'll be fine.

170
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:37,166
Get some dried mackerel. Mizu likes it.

171
00:24:38,208 --> 00:24:40,666
There isn't enough for my medicine.

172
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,500
We think you should try going without.

173
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,208
Slow down!

174
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:02,833
Keep up!

175
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:15,208
The lord is going to be so pleased
with this team.

176
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,833
With Kai, your wish may come true.

177
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,625
Kai is too good for any lord.

178
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:25,791
Kai is... yours.

179
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,125
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

180
00:26:58,208 --> 00:26:59,208
Come on!

181
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:16,041
Akemi, when I strike, run to the others.

182
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,208
Strike who?

183
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:25,208
You wanted to be a man?

184
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:26,833
I had to live as one.

185
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,916
All so the men
who were after you couldn't find you?

186
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:32,375
And so I could have my revenge

187
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:35,375
against the man who made me this way.

188
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:37,041
A monster.

189
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,458
I want to see all of you,

190
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:46,458
not who your mother
wants you to pretend to be.

191
00:29:47,083 --> 00:29:49,625
All I did was train with a sword.

192
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:51,958
Show me.

193
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,041
I've never faced a naginata.

194
00:29:58,125 --> 00:29:59,416
A bit old-fashioned,

195
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,875
but no better weapon
when outnumbered in battle.

196
00:30:02,416 --> 00:30:04,750
Don't worry, we can start slow.

197
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:11,916
Ready?

198
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:14,833
Don't hold back.

199
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:28,125
Not bad.

200
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:37,875
Unsheathe it.

201
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:39,958
Show me your blade.

202
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,458
I don't want to hurt you.

203
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,291
Oh.

204
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,208
Okay, that's enough.

205
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:07,625
Did you also lose your backbone
when you lost your title?

206
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,375
You are a monster.

207
00:32:09,208 --> 00:32:12,291
After what seemed an eternity of sunshine,

208
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:16,458
one day, the sky darkened.

209
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:20,541
The rain washed away
the dye on her kimono,

210
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:27,000
revealing the phoenix crest
of her former clan.

211
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:30,166
The ronin now realized

212
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,500
the bride shared
the blood of his sworn enemy.

213
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:40,708
The bride exclaimed she had run away
from her father's evil clan.

214
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:44,083
She swore her loyalty
was to the ronin alone.

215
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:47,916
But for the first time in years...

216
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:56,958
the ronin felt the storm rage inside him.

217
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,708
He left early
to take the horses to the lord.

218
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,666
All of the horses.

219
00:33:14,208 --> 00:33:15,291
Yours too.

220
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,000
I made you tea of gold leaves,

221
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,500
and you spat in it.

222
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:30,375
<i>Hoping to soften her husband's heart...</i>

223
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:40,416
<i>...the bride danced.</i>

224
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:25,750
Those eyes. That's her.

225
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,500
Which white devil do you work for?

226
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,916
The only white devil I see is you.

227
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,083
Let's kill her quick.

228
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:37,125
Who told you I was here? Was it her?

229
00:35:37,666 --> 00:35:39,791
The bounty is a sum few could resist.

230
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:46,916
Mikio.

231
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:58,541
Hyah.

232
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,833
And so the bride met her death,

233
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:14,833
but she did not meet her end.

234
00:36:15,458 --> 00:36:20,333
Within her lifeless body
roiled a tempest of hate,

235
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:25,166
betrayal, injustice, possessing her soul,

236
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:28,416
transforming her into a nightmare,

237
00:36:28,916 --> 00:36:31,208
into an <i>onryō!</i>

238
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,333
No, no, no, no!

239
00:39:03,416 --> 00:39:04,625
For Kinuyo.

240
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:10,875
You are more man
than any come through my door.

241
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,041
Oh no! No!

242
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,208
I came to help.

243
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:44,708
I was a coward before,
but I came back. Forgive me.

244
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,833
You did this.

245
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,791
I would never.

246
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,458
It was her!

247
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:53,375
I saw you smoking opium again.

248
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,708
How did you buy it? You turned her in.

249
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,458
- Admit it!
- Mizu, I didn't!

250
00:39:57,541 --> 00:40:00,000
I sold myself back on the bridge!

251
00:40:00,083 --> 00:40:01,791
I needed my medicine.

252
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,583
He must have turned you in
to win back his title.

253
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:09,625
I am your mother. Your mother.

254
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:10,541
Mizu.

255
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:13,000
He stood by to watch them kill you!

256
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:14,833
He's dishonorable!

257
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:15,750
Weak!

258
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,833
Shut your mouth, you lying whore.

259
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:22,125
He's hurting me!

260
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,958
Mizu! Mizu!

261
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:26,041
Stop it.

262
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:47,666
Mizu. I love you, Mizu. Mizu.

263
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,541
Master! Master!

264
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:02,125
You beat them.
All of them. An entire army.

265
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:06,500
Akemi and I helped.
She killed two men. I killed one.

266
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:09,333
Something came over me from inside.

267
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:12,208
It felt... dark.

268
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:17,666
You want to be like me?
Don't hide from the dark.

269
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,291
More of Hamata's men?

270
00:41:30,083 --> 00:41:33,208
That's her, Princess Akemi.
We found her.

271
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:36,333
By order of Lord Daichi Tokunobu,

272
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,833
his daughter must return with us.

273
00:41:43,416 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm not going anywhere.

274
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:46,958
Right, Mizu?

275
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:48,625
Do we have a problem here?

276
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:51,458
Get him.

277
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:56,166
Take her.

278
00:41:57,583 --> 00:42:02,250
Get off of me!
Mizu! Get off of me!

279
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:05,375
Let me go! Let me go!

280
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:07,291
Mizu!

281
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:10,208
Mizu!

282
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,916
Master? You just stood there.

283
00:42:14,708 --> 00:42:15,916
She's better off.

284
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:25,916
You are no samurai.
A samurai is honorable.

285
00:42:26,541 --> 00:42:28,375
I never said I was a samurai.

286
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:31,166
You did. I am on the path of revenge.

287
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,375
There's no place on it
for love or friendship or weakness.

288
00:42:37,333 --> 00:42:38,958
Now, I have a man to kill.

289
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:56,166
<i>How did this terrible creature come to be?</i>

290
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:58,583
<i>Hate alone was not enough.</i>

291
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,208
<i>It took one more ingredient.</i>

292
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:05,500
<i>Love... poisoned by betrayal,</i>

293
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:11,000
<i>to bring so much bloodshed and woe</i>

294
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,250
<i>to create the</i> onryō.

295
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:30,208
Our humble thanks

296
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:34,041
to our most benevolent shogun.

297
00:43:37,333 --> 00:43:39,125
A terrifying tale.

298
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:43,541
We promised you
the finest entertainment here in Edo,

299
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:45,291
did we not, Akemi?

300
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,583
Yes, my lord.

301
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:52,916
Only one thing was inaccurate.

302
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:55,833
Huh. Was it now?

303
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,041
Indeed.

304
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:01,083
You see, I met an <i>onryō</i> once.

305
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:02,791
A real one.

306
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:05,541
But it was incapable of love.

307
00:44:06,125 --> 00:44:08,416
I searched its eyes for a sign of love

308
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:10,750
or mercy or good.

309
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,333
There was only darkness.
