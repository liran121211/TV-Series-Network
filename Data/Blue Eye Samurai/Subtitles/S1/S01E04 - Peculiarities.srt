1
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,791
Excuse me.

2
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,125
Faster, they're about to start!

3
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:32,208
Come on.
It's going to be a bloodbath. Hurry up.

4
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,250
A duel?

5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,583
A death duel.

6
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,000
The Painter's Signature.

7
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:45,958
Immaculate.

8
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,708
Should I find us an inn for the night?

9
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:53,458
No. I need a brothel.

10
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:54,958
Oh.

11
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,041
Master.

12
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,083
Master?

13
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:03,958
You do know what they do in brothels?

14
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:06,833
Master?

15
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,083
Here.

16
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,083
Welcome, sir. Welcome.

17
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:37,125
We are pleased to have you
select us from options.

18
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:39,666
Do you happen to have an appointment?

19
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:44,000
Madame Kaji is the proprietor here.
I would like to see her.

20
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,416
Madame Kaji's clients book months ahead.

21
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,250
If you prefer older women,

22
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,666
we cater to every taste.

23
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,333
My taste is to be seen by Madame Kaji.

24
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,708
You can wait here.

25
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,291
You do have money?

26
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,250
Ah.

27
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,875
Ringo, this will be some time.

28
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,875
If you'd like to explore the harbor...

29
00:04:39,958 --> 00:04:42,000
An apprentice should stay with his master.

30
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,666
Mm.

31
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,791
Oh, bad boy.

32
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,916
Get back here.

33
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,958
If that's to your liking,

34
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,541
we have other mothers to keep you company.

35
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,125
I asked for Madame Kaji.

36
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:43,583
I bought your contracts.

37
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,041
Gave each of you a place here.

38
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,375
Do you think
you earned your place this week?

39
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,375
Did you?

40
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,416
Hands.

41
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,666
To be alive is to wake up
and do things you don't want to do,

42
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,750
or don't bother waking up.

43
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,958
I like when you slap them.

44
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,416
Someone wants to see you.

45
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,833
I said, "No, thank you," to company.

46
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,208
The gentleman asked for me.

47
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,333
Madame Kaji?

48
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:49,708
I understand not one of my girls
caught the gentleman's interest.

49
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,958
If it is boys he is after,
he need only ask.

50
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,708
Many famous samurai
prefer the stamen to the pistil.

51
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:01,583
Madam Kaji's tea house is known
for catering to peculiarities.

52
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,458
Nothing desired is peculiar.

53
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,125
Any woman can study woodcuts
and master the 12 and 20 positions.

54
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:13,458
I offer what the rare heart hungers.

55
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,791
Strong men come here
to be weak, uncentered.

56
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,500
They make themselves fools.

57
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,125
I hope the gentleman
isn't one of those monkish samurai

58
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,208
who cares only about the sword.

59
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:33,958
Isn't it said,

60
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,791
"To master the way of battle,

61
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:39,333
one must become acquainted
with every art?"

62
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,625
Sex? An art?

63
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,125
Hmm.

64
00:07:43,458 --> 00:07:46,166
The gentleman was wise to seek me.

65
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:49,958
Come.

66
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,583
There is an art to sex, yes.

67
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,875
Done correctly,
it may be a form of worship.

68
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,458
The bud honors god by blooming.

69
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:05,000
Some bloom to sun, some to rain.

70
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:06,583
Look.

71
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,166
What is it?

72
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,541
A window. A mirror.

73
00:08:12,041 --> 00:08:14,708
Desire is beyond the need of my purpose.

74
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:19,541
If you are only a sword,
are you even a man or a mere demon?

75
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:26,791
"The Floating World."

76
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,125
That's what they call
the pleasure quarters.

77
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,708
Where one must travel to reach heaven.

78
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,291
One can only ascend if willing to rise.

79
00:08:44,083 --> 00:08:47,916
To deny desire is to cut out
a corner of your own heart.

80
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:52,333
To sever a limb
and still expect to fight true.

81
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,083
He was honest with his desire.

82
00:08:57,166 --> 00:09:01,583
That is a swordsman
who knows the shape of his soul.

83
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,500
Now, tell me what you want.

84
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,291
Nothing desired is peculiar.

85
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,833
If the gentleman cannot state his desire,

86
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,291
perhaps he prefers to write it.

87
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,666
How do you know that name?

88
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,458
"Abijah Fowler."

89
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,750
Peculiarities.

90
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,625
Fowler's tastes are... loathsome.

91
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,125
Curating his entertainment
requires a specialist.

92
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:14,250
You have murder in your eyes.
I see your desire now.

93
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,583
His castle allows no one in,

94
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:19,375
but you've sent your prostitutes to him.

95
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,791
You've been inside. You've seen him.

96
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,291
Enough times to know you never want to.

97
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:32,541
He's a man who began life
taking pleasure in others' pain.

98
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,291
Boredom has only made him experimental.

99
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:39,791
Some men's eyes say plainly
they've tasted human flesh.

100
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:41,666
Raw.

101
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:45,750
If you serviced him at his keep,
then there's a way inside.

102
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,375
You will tell me where it is.

103
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,791
Why would I help you kill my customer?

104
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,250
Because he deserves to die.

105
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,708
If you killed every man I've seen
who couldn't come till someone bled,

106
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,291
you'd wear your blade to a stump.

107
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,416
Hmm.

108
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:06,208
The gentleman and I have no business.

109
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:10,583
He is welcome to all the hospitality
my tea house provides.

110
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,458
Perhaps in your visits,
you met Heiji Shindo?

111
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,416
Perhaps he laid a hand on you.

112
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:27,791
If it was his right hand,
consider yourself avenged.

113
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,458
You provide services.

114
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:32,666
So do I.

115
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,000
Name your desire.

116
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:54,416
Under the law,
revenge is a luxury for men like you.

117
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:59,250
Women like me must be practical.

118
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,250
We must focus on our result.

119
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:04,708
That gambling house
belongs to Boss Hamata.

120
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:08,458
Everything belongs to Boss Hamata.

121
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,208
Him and his Thousand Claw army.

122
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,458
Half of what we make is his.

123
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:33,625
<i>At times, he asks for more.</i>

124
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,541
<i>Anyone who challenges him</i>

125
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:47,041
<i>wakes to find a Thousand Claws there
to destroy everything they love.</i>

126
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:56,916
Six months ago, Boss Hamata took Kinuyo.

127
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,708
<i>I bought Kinuyo from her father,
who'd grown tired of abusing her.</i>

128
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:11,291
<i>He knew nothing about his daughter
except that she was deaf and mute.</i>

129
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,833
<i>He had no idea there was a world inside.</i>

130
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,208
<i>In time, she grew to trust me.</i>

131
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,583
<i>She told me she would rather die
than be touched by a man again.</i>

132
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:01,250
I promised she never would be.

133
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:06,375
<i>But Boss Hamata likes
to break delicate things,</i>

134
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,458
<i>so he took her.</i>

135
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,375
He took her from me.

136
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,250
I promised her.

137
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,416
There is only one way to spare Kinuyo.

138
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,666
You want me to kill Boss Hamata.

139
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,666
No.

140
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,166
Her.

141
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,625
They know my love for Kinuyo.

142
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:44,541
If anything should happen
to Boss Hamata or her,

143
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,875
a Thousand Claws will come to my door
and kill every soul in my care.

144
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,750
It must look like an accident.

145
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,458
It will.

146
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:55,500
There can be no witnesses.

147
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,791
I will be like smoke.

148
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,000
Swear it.

149
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,166
I swear.

150
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,041
Then I will tell you
what you want to know.

151
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,375
You can rest here tonight until it's time.

152
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,875
No eyes will watch you.

153
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,208
Can I send you anything?

154
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:21,500
Only privacy.

155
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,208
Before you open the door to heaven,

156
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:31,833
I want you to face Kinuyo
and make this sign.

157
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:37,416
She will know you are there as my hand,

158
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
and she will be at peace.

159
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:02,625
Ahem.

160
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,375
Ringo?

161
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,666
May I serve you?

162
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:08,166
I said I don't want any company.

163
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:12,250
Please. If you don't let me in,
Madame will beat me.

164
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:51,333
Akemi?

165
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,458
How many days have you been at prayer?

166
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:58,541
Don't exhaust the gods with your requests.
Save something for when you need them.

167
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:06,500
Hmm. Be angry with me all you want.
We're still going to Edo in two days.

168
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:12,125
You need to be ready
to get married and to be married.

169
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,791
If your mother was here, she would've
taught you what it is to be a wife.

170
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:19,250
But to be clear, she was not ideal.
She talked back often, like you, but...

171
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:21,583
she knew how to please me.

172
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,416
The 12 and 20 positions.

173
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,833
A wife should be familiar with the 12.

174
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,625
The 20 are for professionals,

175
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:34,291
but you're marrying
into the shogunate, so...

176
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,541
Akemi. At some point,
you have to talk to me.

177
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,750
- Where would she have gone?
- I have no idea.

178
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:56,833
Find my daughter!

179
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,500
Never seen him. Husband?

180
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,208
Let's go. This place is too cheap.

181
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,791
It's Mihonoseki.

182
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,583
You said you wanted to work here.

183
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,583
Don't you wanna make more money on me?
We can do better.

184
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,223
We can do better.

185
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:47,833
We can do better.

186
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:08,250
- We need to go. Now.
- Okay, one more town.

187
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:09,916
- This way. I know it.
- Huh?

188
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:23,166
No, no, no.
That's the long way around, by the coast!

189
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:27,416
We'll have good luck this way.
I have a feeling.

190
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,083
Oh, Taigen, where are you?

191
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,958
He will hit you with a fist.

192
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,083
He will hit you with a club.

193
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,875
He will hit you with... a hammer.

194
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:03,375
This is boring.

195
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,041
I'm bored.

196
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:07,208
I like it.

197
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,458
You will tell me
everything you know about Mizu.

198
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,416
There's a reason
I haven't been down here in a decade.

199
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,125
I'm not waiting on you for supper.

200
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:29,916
He humiliated you.

201
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,666
He ruined your marriage
into the Tokunobu clan.

202
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,875
Why suffer so much to protect an enemy?

203
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,750
He deserves better than you.

204
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,458
He will cut you with a knife.

205
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:19,625
I never asked them to build this.

206
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,208
They just assumed
the white man required a chapel

207
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,458
and put it by the dungeon.

208
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,625
We're not friends.

209
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,916
I haven't, uh, spoken to you in some time.

210
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,083
Wouldn't do you
the dishonor of asking for a favor.

211
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:40,708
But I believe
there's something I can do for you.

212
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,166
They've been godless here
as long as they've been.

213
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,166
You saw what they did
to your priests and faithful.

214
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:52,916
Kicked out and crucified,
the Word dead in their mouths, unspread.

215
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,833
Heathens, surely, these Japanese.

216
00:21:55,916 --> 00:21:58,541
Lucky for you,
their man in charge is greedy.

217
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,000
I plan to cut
that shogun's head from his shoulders

218
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:06,333
and reimagine
this nation more to my liking.

219
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:10,708
Now, normal days, I'd imagine
you're indifferent to that outcome.

220
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,791
Fair enough, fair play.
Same as me to yours.

221
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:19,833
But I'll tell you this, though.
If this all goes my way,

222
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:23,708
I will go ahead and take it for a sign

223
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:26,875
that you tilted the wind to my back,

224
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:29,333
and I will, in kind,

225
00:22:29,875 --> 00:22:32,833
build into my new station a pulpit.

226
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:37,958
I will send for your priests
to bring them your Word

227
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:42,375
and hand you a nation of souls.

228
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:46,375
My thanks if you see fit.

229
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,541
It's no matter to me either way.

230
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:56,541
I've got no use for souls.

231
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,666
Ah, this way, that way.
Nothing's good enough for her!

232
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,666
Too wet, too dry, too smelly.
Why do I listen?

233
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,166
Most girls open a mouth,
and I pour in a drop of this.

234
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:15,666
Blessed silence.

235
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,416
They wake up in their new home,
and Goro counts his fortune.

236
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,041
But for Akemi, only respect and restraint.

237
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,125
Goro?

238
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,833
Forgive me.
You know I'd be lost without you.

239
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,416
What's a few more towns together?

240
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,125
Come on, it's almost time.

241
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,708
Keep up!
I'm not missing the duel 'cause of you.

242
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,958
I wanna see blood!

243
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,375
- A duel?
- A skinny guy and a big guy.

244
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:44,416
I bet five mon on the skinny one.
He's got a face like a demon.

245
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,500
A demon!

246
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:48,875
This is our town.

247
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:51,541
Huh?

248
00:24:02,583 --> 00:24:05,166
Aww, we missed the blood.

249
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:14,875
Taigen. That's his scarf.

250
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,250
Demon.

251
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,583
I found our brothel.

252
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,250
Oh no, no, no, no. Not Madame Kaji's.

253
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:48,916
You should be
with the courtesans. Elegance.

254
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:52,666
They're known for peculiarities.

255
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:56,416
Well.

256
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:10,666
Goro!

257
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,041
No, no! Out! Out! Get out.

258
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,625
Oh what,
what kind of welcome is that?

259
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:20,041
You're not welcome!
Not since you sold us that poxy puss.

260
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:22,875
Madame Kaji won't even
look at a girl from you.

261
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:25,250
Oh, she'll look at this one.

262
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:53,583
Ahem.

263
00:25:58,625 --> 00:26:00,791
Oh, she'll pay a fortune for you.

264
00:26:01,291 --> 00:26:03,916
I always wanted to be rich.
Can you imagine?

265
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,416
What do you think it feels like?

266
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,833
Like never thinking
about how you're rich.

267
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,250
Madame Kaji. May I...

268
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,750
The last words I said to you, Goro?

269
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,875
"Speak to me again,
and I'll stab your nose."

270
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,708
If you could put off violence a moment,

271
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:30,708
may I introduce Akemi?

272
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,291
A revered courtesan from Gion.

273
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:36,458
A castle topper if I ever saw one.

274
00:26:36,541 --> 00:26:37,541
Her feet alone...

275
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:39,541
We already have a princess act.

276
00:26:39,625 --> 00:26:41,791
Oh, not like Akemi.

277
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:45,750
Sings, dances, calligraphy, koto.

278
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:50,333
Can debate the sutras
like Takuan the Monk.

279
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:54,208
Not one of your usual wrung-out widows,
nighthawks, and tea steepers.

280
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:55,958
Hmm.

281
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,333
Your richest client's favorite position?

282
00:27:00,583 --> 00:27:01,666
Me, on top.

283
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:07,083
Goro, one thing to credit you
is you are consistent.

284
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:10,125
- Mm.
- You're an idiot every day of your life.

285
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,666
You've been had.
She's no more courtesan than I'm a maiden.

286
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:16,125
You're the real thing, aren't you?

287
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:19,958
An actual princess bathed in milk.

288
00:27:20,541 --> 00:27:21,375
- Virgin.
- I...

289
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:23,666
You've barely seen
two cocks your whole life.

290
00:27:27,208 --> 00:27:32,166
Hmm. But your inexperience
may be a beauty mark, not a wart...

291
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,916
if you want to work.

292
00:27:34,458 --> 00:27:35,458
I do.

293
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:37,291
I will.

294
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,458
This is no fancy pleasure house

295
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:41,708
with hours of dance
and witty conversation.

296
00:27:41,791 --> 00:27:43,041
What the geisha hopes to avoid

297
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:45,005
at the end of the night
is how we start the day.

298
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:47,500
I don't pretend
it is work any woman likes,

299
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,333
but if you can survive it,
you will be safe in my care.

300
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:55,958
Goro, 50 ryo for your virgin princess
if she performs to satisfaction tonight.

301
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:57,041
A test.

302
00:27:57,625 --> 00:27:59,250
Come in the morning to collect

303
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:02,125
your money or your girl.

304
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:06,541
May the goddess Benzaiten
guide your hands and those feet.

305
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:11,000
Yes, girl. Just like that,
you've been bought and sold.

306
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:12,583
Fast as a marriage.

307
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:13,875
My name is Akemi.

308
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,625
I'll bother to remember that
if you're still here tomorrow.

309
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,000
Your first test, eat.

310
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:23,291
Or be eaten.

311
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,291
This is Akemi, an actual highborn noble.

312
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:37,416
More than just powder and priss, like Ise.

313
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:38,791
Hmph.

314
00:28:38,875 --> 00:28:42,666
Right now, she's regretting
running away from her daddy's castle.

315
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,750
Not at all.

316
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,166
I'm eager to find a customer.

317
00:28:47,916 --> 00:28:48,916
Hmph.

318
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,916
Here. One of Ise's old ones.

319
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,125
It's torn, but if you drape it,
it hardly shows.

320
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:58,708
- Is that how they're wearing it now?
- It's the latest fashion in Kyoto.

321
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,666
All of you,
finish preening and get out there.

322
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:07,458
I counted four men still alone
with their pants on and purses tied.

323
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,767
I'm not taking
that blue-eyed freak.

324
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,500
Why do I always get the ugly ones?

325
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,625
So far, he turned down everyone.

326
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:20,208
Let him turn down me.

327
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:21,291
And me.

328
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,958
I'll take him.

329
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:31,125
No one ever refuses me. May I, Madame?

330
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,250
Isn't Watari the Walrus here tonight?

331
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:39,750
On my first night, you made me
prove my skills under him for six hours.

332
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:41,125
Cracked two ribs.

333
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:44,000
He's gotten so fat,
he can't get it up anymore.

334
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,208
I bet he'd give a big blubbery bonus

335
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:49,166
if someone could make
his little seal bark again.

336
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:50,666
Hmm.

337
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:54,083
Akemi will take Master Watari.

338
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,833
You fail to make him rise and fall,

339
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:59,750
you so much
as wrinkle your perfect nose at him,

340
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,041
you wait in the cold for Goro.

341
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:03,958
First, I'd much rather...

342
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:06,375
There is no end
to that sentence that matters.

343
00:30:07,375 --> 00:30:08,875
We'll be watching.

344
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,333
Oh! You are uncommonly delicate.

345
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,583
Take off your kimono.

346
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,458
More sake?

347
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,791
You can drink so much.

348
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,291
I bet you were a mighty warrior
in your day.

349
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,208
Never won a fair fight.

350
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:42,583
Come closer.

351
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:45,500
If your sword isn't sharp, your wit is.

352
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
I do enjoy the written arts.

353
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:52,541
A fellow warrior of words. I knew it.

354
00:30:52,625 --> 00:30:54,833
Oh! You read?

355
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:55,958
Of course.

356
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:58,291
I used to sneak books
from my father's library

357
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:00,666
and memorize
all the poetry my tutors forbade.

358
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,041
Really?
And who's your favorite poet?

359
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:06,625
Oh, so many.

360
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:09,833
Shotetsu. Minamoto no Shigeyuki.

361
00:31:09,916 --> 00:31:10,750
Oh, ah.

362
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:12,500
My favorite is this poetess,

363
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:13,833
Ono no Komachi.

364
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:17,041
Her words light a fire
and fill me with smoke.

365
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:19,083
Shall I recite?

366
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:21,875
Mmm...

367
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:23,875
<i>I yearn for you most</i>

368
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,625
<i>On this moonless night...</i>

369
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:27,708
<i>I lie awake</i>

370
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,500
<i>Hot embers of passion in my breast</i>

371
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,791
<i>Setting my heart aflame</i>

372
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,875
Oh. Oh-oh!

373
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:38,958
Look who decided to join our party!

374
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,875
Hello, old friend! I missed you.

375
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,000
Do you enjoy renga?

376
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,250
You know renga poetry too?

377
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,416
What's a party without renga?

378
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,625
You start with the haiku,
I answer with two lines.

379
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:59,166
Your brushstroke. My brushstroke.

380
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,541
Hmm. Ah!

381
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:05,958
<i>Drink streams from soft hand</i>

382
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,500
<i>Its taste bitter on my tongue</i>

383
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,083
<i>Soothing elixir</i>

384
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,875
<i>From soft hands also streams milk</i>

385
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:16,708
<i>Its taste sweet</i>

386
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,750
<i>Warm to my breast</i>

387
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,958
<i>Breasts like two full moons</i>

388
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:24,875
<i>Illuminate the dark sea</i>

389
00:32:24,958 --> 00:32:27,833
<i>Envelop me with your light...</i>

390
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:31,291
<i>Heavenly orbs you must drink from afar</i>

391
00:32:31,791 --> 00:32:33,375
<i>Or scorch your skin</i>

392
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,416
<i>Show me your brushstroke</i>

393
00:32:42,625 --> 00:32:44,750
<i>Fire cannot burn ice</i>

394
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,833
<i>Its touch makes it a hot spring</i>

395
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:52,375
<i>Sear me, I'll explode...</i>

396
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:54,791
<i>No man can grasp the sunlight</i>

397
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:56,958
<i>Only worship fleeting rays</i>

398
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,708
<i>To the sun goddess</i>

399
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,875
<i>I give</i>

400
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:02,458
<i>Sweet</i>

401
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:04,875
<i>Sweet...</i>

402
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,583
<i>Sweet nectar of your body</i>

403
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:11,708
<i>A gift she declines</i>

404
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,791
One thing no man can resist.

405
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,500
Himself.

406
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:28,833
Still half the night left.
Any luck with blue eyes yet?

407
00:33:28,916 --> 00:33:31,708
Eh, he asked to be alone. Thank goodness.

408
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:34,791
No one refuses me.

409
00:33:54,958 --> 00:33:55,958
May I serve you?

410
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:19,833
Your eyes!

411
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:24,375
Whatever clever insult comes next
is not as clever as you think.

412
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,708
They're beautiful.

413
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:34,708
A color I've never seen
outside the sea and sky.

414
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:38,333
Huh. I see.

415
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,666
Your Madame explained
how it's some essential part of the soul

416
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,125
that draws men to brothels
when it's only naked flattery.

417
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,458
Do men usually fall for this?

418
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,583
The ones I've known. Yes.

419
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,250
I thought it was tea.

420
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:55,875
I don't drink.

421
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:59,166
Madame thought
you might prefer sake to help you relax.

422
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:01,125
Maybe just a sip.

423
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:05,041
If you'll join me.
I have ugly business coming.

424
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,166
Suddenly, I'm glad for company.

425
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:18,875
To flattery.

426
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,041
Hot.

427
00:35:28,958 --> 00:35:31,208
Where I'm from,
that's how the men prefer it.

428
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:32,708
Kyoto.

429
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:35,750
I've only been there once, recently.

430
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,958
Beautiful, isn't it?

431
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:40,875
Dirty and crowded.

432
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,041
Full of puffed-up crows
posing as swordsmen.

433
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:47,833
I beat the most ridiculous samurai there.

434
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:49,500
If you can call him that.

435
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:52,041
I cut off his chignon.
Then he came chasing after me,

436
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:55,666
demanding a rematch,
saying I ruined his engagement.

437
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:59,250
I think he was angrier
about his hair than his marriage.

438
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:01,875
What was his name?

439
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:03,625
Hmm.

440
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:05,625
I can't remember.

441
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,916
Anyway. He's dead now.

442
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,500
What?

443
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,416
Oh yeah. I killed him.

444
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:21,958
She's good.

445
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:25,250
Let me go!

446
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,333
Get off me!

447
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,710
You think I don't remember you?

448
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,958
Princess Akemi of the Tokunobu clan.

449
00:36:31,458 --> 00:36:32,916
You drugged my cup.

450
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,875
I wish it was poison!

451
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,625
Oh, Taigen.

452
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:39,875
Oh, shut up.

453
00:36:40,625 --> 00:36:41,625
I didn't kill him.

454
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,791
I left him with his life
and a contract to fight.

455
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:47,666
He's alive? Where is he?

456
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,166
You came all this way
to save a doomed engagement?

457
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:57,458
Your father probably lined up
a nice young replacement lord to marry.

458
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,750
The shogun's son.

459
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:04,458
Women in our world
don't have a single good option.

460
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,125
Except you.

461
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,958
Like some magical forest creature,

462
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:11,000
you could have anything you want,

463
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:14,166
and then you beg to eat trash.

464
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,000
You got a girl.

465
00:37:23,083 --> 00:37:24,375
A pretty girl.

466
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:26,916
Wait. How does that work?

467
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,583
She's not a girl. She's a princess.

468
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:33,208
She's Taigen's princess,
and she tried to kill me.

469
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,666
She screams, kill her.

470
00:37:37,166 --> 00:37:38,958
She moves, kill her.

471
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:41,333
What? I can't kill her.

472
00:37:41,416 --> 00:37:43,291
What do you think an apprentice does?

473
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,583
Do you have to stare?

474
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,375
Sorry.

475
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:11,166
<i>Hamata's gambling house
is filled with his Thousand Claws.</i>

476
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,750
<i>He never lets Kinuyo out of his sight.</i>

477
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,833
<i>Only when the moxa doctor comes each dawn</i>

478
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:19,250
<i>to treat the sores Hamata gave her.</i>

479
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,458
<i>Even then,
his trusted bodyguard keeps watch.</i>

480
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:39,416
I'll protect you.

481
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,500
Run to the night watchman.
Tell him there's been a fight.

482
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,041
Two people.

483
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,916
You hear me, boy?

484
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,791
To the gate. Go!

485
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:32,666
You showed her the sign?

486
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,916
What did she sign back?

487
00:43:39,416 --> 00:43:40,666
She understood.

488
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:50,791
At the furthest point,
before rock becomes shore, is a well.

489
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:54,833
A hundred paces north
is a door covered by tide.

490
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:57,500
It leads to a tunnel under the sea

491
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,125
into the belly of Fowler's castle.

492
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:05,250
Sleep the day. Then go and die.

493
00:44:17,125 --> 00:44:18,708
I should have just killed you.

494
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:22,208
That was my mistake.
I wanted to meet you first.

495
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:25,750
To see what power you have over Taigen
to send him running from me.

496
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:29,208
Under your mask,
you're not the killer you pretend to be.

497
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Just go.

498
00:44:39,791 --> 00:44:41,958
I thought you had to be something special.

499
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:44,000
Your face isn't even so scary.

500
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:47,166
You're just... angry.

501
00:44:48,416 --> 00:44:49,875
{\an8}I see why he likes you.

502
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:52,750
{\an8}You're just like Taigen
when we were children.

503
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,625
{\an8}A fucking brat.

504
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,125
You knew him?

505
00:45:04,958 --> 00:45:05,958
Boy.

506
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,541
Kill everyone. Then burn it down.
