1
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,041
Ringo! Ugh.

2
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,333
Customer. Big hat.

3
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,291
Welcome, sir. I'll bring you some tea.

4
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,666
It's not good tea,
but it's hot, and you're frozen,

5
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,666
and I'll bring you a rag
because when I'm frozen, my snot drips.

6
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,291
Then a nice big soba.
We make the best soba.

7
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:32,750
Honest. Bad tea, great soba. Okay?

8
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:45,333
Stumpy! More noodles, fast.

9
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,291
Finish your bowls.

10
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:51,041
I paid your fathers good money for you.

11
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,916
The brothels will pay me even more

12
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,625
once you get some curve on,
you skinny country nothings. Eat!

13
00:03:05,791 --> 00:03:07,250
- Go! Hurry!
- Huh?

14
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:10,541
If that flesh-trader kills anyone here,
it'd be bad for business.

15
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:13,958
Go and don't spill!

16
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:31,083
It's good, right?

17
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,250
Ah.

18
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:41,541
Finally!

19
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:44,041
Eat up, girls. Eat it all!

20
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,750
Oh.

21
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,125
What are you? A dog?

22
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,916
You let a dog serve food!

23
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,666
Forgive my son.
Can't go a day without breaking dishes.

24
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,083
Ringo, clean him!

25
00:03:58,166 --> 00:03:59,166
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,333
- Ah!
- Argh!

27
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,458
Sorry, sorry.

28
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,833
I should put down this lame dog.

29
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,291
I'm not a dog.

30
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,166
Did you just bark?

31
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,750
Do you know who I am?

32
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:32,708
I am Hachiman the Flesh-Trader.

33
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,125
No one messes with Hachi!

34
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,750
Hmm. Impressive.

35
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,208
I've never seen a gun like it.

36
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,458
Front loading, not a Japanese pistol.

37
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,583
A European design, isn't it?

38
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:14,208
Ugh!

39
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,250
That would make it illegal.

40
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,416
Hachiman the Flesh-Trader.

41
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,958
Of course, I've heard of you.

42
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,250
Never leaves a village
without buying one of its daughters.

43
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,875
You must have important friends
to own a weapon like that.

44
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,750
Why do you know so much about Hachi?

45
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,750
Maybe I've been following you.

46
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:40,500
The famous Hachi
with the famous gun.

47
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,041
I'd love a gun like that.

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,958
You can tell me who sold it to you.

49
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,583
Hmm. Fuck off.

50
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:55,416
You will tell me who sold you that gun.

51
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:05,875
You put my bullet against your blade?

52
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,041
You don't deserve my blade.

53
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,625
You don't even deserve this blade.

54
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,750
Take the gun if you want it! Take it!

55
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,166
Ah! No!

56
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:38,166
It's a filthy gun from a filthy place.
I don't want it.

57
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,666
I wanna know who sold it to you.

58
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,000
Tell me now.

59
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:47,416
Heiji Shindo.
I bought it from Heiji Shindo!

60
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,208
Heiji Shindo.

61
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,458
Where is Heiji Shindo?

62
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,291
I don't know! I swear.

63
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:00,916
Ah!

64
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:15,250
You dead-eyed, half-blooded demon bastard.

65
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,208
You look like an <i>onryō.</i>

66
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,416
Hoo!

67
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:22,500
Hm?

68
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,708
I found you!

69
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,142
I'd never catch up on the path,
but I remember this shortcut

70
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,726
'cause when we traveled
to the Izushi shrine for my 7th birthday,

71
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,958
I went to pee and got lost,

72
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,250
so I slept with a family
of tanuki for three days

73
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:37,533
and ate leaves and scarabs, and got to
know the forest really, really well, so...

74
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,041
Go home.

75
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:47,791
I hate home!

76
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,166
Please. My whole life,
I couldn't do anything right,

77
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,625
but now I know what I'm supposed to do.

78
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,208
Be a samurai, like you.

79
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:02,416
Please. Let me be your apprentice.
Uh, I'll do anything.

80
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:09,875
A breeze can throw
a crane off course.

81
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:13,750
You... are a typhoon.

82
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,666
Please! I'm strong.
I can carry your things,

83
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,250
and you can have
the best soba in the world every day!

84
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,000
And I'll do anything you ask... Master.

85
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,208
Uh, anything so I can learn
to be just like you.

86
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:39,708
Like me?

87
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,416
You're deformed, but you're still strong.

88
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,125
To a man lost in the dark,
an ember can light the way.

89
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,166
Thank you for my ember.

90
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,208
I was lost without course so long.

91
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,625
Please.

92
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:14,500
Let this ember's light brighten a path
from this Heiji Shindo to the men I seek.

93
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,916
Please guide my steps until I find them.

94
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,166
Please give me the strength to kill them.

95
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,000
Or let me die.

96
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,791
Please

97
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,000
protect Swordfather from time and harm.

98
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,375
Agh!

99
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,166
You wanna go?

100
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,208
Go ahead.

101
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:40,708
Just jump.

102
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:51,916
You think you can fight us?

103
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,750
An orphan?

104
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,083
I know what you are.

105
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,375
Your whore mother killed herself

106
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,083
because your father is a white devil.

107
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,583
Told you.

108
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,458
Round eyes.

109
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:33,041
Like a dog.

110
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,750
Hmm. The heavens throw treasure.

111
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:27,458
One, two, and...

112
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:01,833
Hmm.

113
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,791
Take the bowl as you go. Thank you.

114
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,166
You did not go.

115
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,166
Hmm. Have you somewhere to go?

116
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:21,708
Yes.

117
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,583
Well, go then.

118
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,791
Now. Goodbye.

119
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,000
It's a strange metal.

120
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,291
Hmm. Cold morning.

121
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,083
It would be nice if someone made tea.

122
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,750
Hmm.

123
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,291
Would be nice if someone got my tongs.

124
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,583
The longer ones.

125
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Hmm.

126
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:43,083
It would be nice
if somebody hammered out the impurities.

127
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:56,166
Would be nice if someone kept proper time.

128
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:43,583
Come on, people. Keep it moving. Let's go.

129
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,583
Next!

130
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,916
This travel pass is invalid.

131
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,625
It's my husband's.

132
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,583
It's invalid without him.

133
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,250
Next!

134
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:03,166
He died. I make the baskets.
He only sold them.

135
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,916
Please. Or I can't feed my children.

136
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,500
You know the rules.
Women can't travel without a chaperone.

137
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,625
Next!

138
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,125
Travel pass.

139
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:22,083
- Next.
- Please!

140
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,875
Excuse me.
Would you perhaps be able to tell me whe...

141
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,833
Excuse me. Could you help me find the...

142
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,333
Watch it, asshole.

143
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,375
Apologies.

144
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:07,541
I'm looking for something,
but Kyoto's very big.

145
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,250
Do you know
where I can find the Shindo Dojo?

146
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,333
Shindo?

147
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,416
That's our dojo.

148
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,791
You're gonna apply?

149
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,833
You look like a blind beggar.

150
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,250
If you would please show me
how to find your dojo,

151
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,791
I would be grateful.

152
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,833
Sure.

153
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:29,625
Follow the road to the shrine.
Once you go around the gates,

154
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,833
you'll see the sign
across the puppet show.

155
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,375
Good luck.

156
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,750
Hyah!

157
00:22:12,375 --> 00:22:15,791
You look lost, lost boy. Come on inside.

158
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,291
Rest a while.

159
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:19,916
I'm looking for the Shindo Dojo.

160
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,750
Which... this I see is not.

161
00:22:27,833 --> 00:22:30,666
This is better. This is the Shindo House.

162
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,375
If you wanna show off
your sword skills, you can do it here.

163
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:36,666
We can polish the tip up for you.

164
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,833
I must decline.

165
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:41,000
My business is urgent.

166
00:22:41,083 --> 00:22:44,916
Most men grab first,
ask prices later.

167
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:47,250
You're different.

168
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,166
Polite, sweet.

169
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:52,958
But firm.

170
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,750
Okay, lost boy.
Walk east to the Kamo River.

171
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,458
Take the bridge to the temple
with the thousand creepy statues.

172
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,000
It's on the hill just past.

173
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,541
I wish you a successful day of business.

174
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:11,166
Uh-oh. Oh!

175
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,833
How much for one night?

176
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:20,125
How much for three?

177
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,041
It's all paid for.

178
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,541
Just relax and enjoy.

179
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,375
Have you ever been with a woman before?

180
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,916
You just have to learn.

181
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:41,375
Round, firm, like a pumpkin.

182
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,333
You can be a little rough with it.

183
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:49,125
These, you have to be gentler,
soft like ripe peaches.

184
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:51,166
You like peaches?

185
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:53,958
Peaches.

186
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,708
Make way.
Make way for Princess Akemi!

187
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,541
Make way!

188
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:55,500
Father, I know your wisdom
is beyond reproach.

189
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,791
I submit to your will wholeheartedly.

190
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:01,833
I would be remiss
if I didn't speak my mind in regard to my future.

191
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:40,166
Did you talk to him, Seki? Tell me!

192
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:41,916
Uh...

193
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,916
I am well, Akemi-sama.
Thank you for asking.

194
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Hm.

195
00:25:47,958 --> 00:25:51,333
This morning, I made indelicate mention,

196
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:54,041
and now he told me to fetch you.

197
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:59,750
When you speak to him,
remember to lilt your voice.

198
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:02,708
So, I should speak like a child.

199
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:08,583
Or like a woman
who intends to get what she wants.

200
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:19,291
{\an8}Father, forgive my interrup...

201
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:27,875
Tomoe will make a great lord one day.
He does what he wants.

202
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:33,583
Right now, Tomoe wants a mess!

203
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:35,625
But you, my pearl,

204
00:26:36,208 --> 00:26:38,083
you have a different duty, no?

205
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:42,625
To create alliances by being
a pleasing wife to a great man.

206
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:45,583
Now I'm told you believe

207
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:48,541
you have an opinion
on who you might want to marry.

208
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:55,500
Father, I know your wisdom
is beyond reproach,

209
00:26:55,583 --> 00:26:58,750
and I submit to your will wholly,
but I would be remiss if...

210
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,958
Do you know what happens
when you feed a pig sweets?

211
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:03,625
Of course you don't.

212
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:06,291
Your life has been robed in silk.

213
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:08,958
You've never seen the mud of the sty.

214
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:12,041
Your father wasn't a pig farmer like mine.

215
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:14,541
When a farmer
feeds his pig too many sweets,

216
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:17,416
its teeth rot. Its gums fester.

217
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,291
The infection goes to its brain,

218
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:22,708
and it must be slaughtered
before it reaches full size.

219
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,791
The pig can't be blamed.
He's a pig and will eat all it can.

220
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:29,458
The fault is with the farmer...

221
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:31,833
who knows better.

222
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:35,166
Am I a pig, Father?

223
00:27:35,666 --> 00:27:39,333
You want sugar
when there are proper options.

224
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:42,458
More than a few lords
have taken notice of you and inquired.

225
00:27:42,541 --> 00:27:44,375
Ah! News came just this morning.

226
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:48,083
Lord Saito's wife died in childbirth,
and he needs a new bride.

227
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,750
He's an old man!
And a drunk and a whoremonger!

228
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:54,583
Lord Saito earns 100,000 koku!

229
00:27:55,583 --> 00:27:58,250
{\an8}Is that your price for me?

230
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:05,125
If I don't marry you off, you'll end up
in a brothel lying with him anyway.

231
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:09,083
So would you rather be
his wife or his whore?

232
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:26,583
Father.

233
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,291
I know your wisdom is beyond reproach,

234
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,791
and I submit to your will wholeheartedly.

235
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,583
I... I spoke from fear,
as these men live so far away,

236
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:39,666
and I cannot imagine a life
without my father close.

237
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:43,291
Please, consider someone who lives near.

238
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:47,541
Someone you trust to protect me
and the interests of our clan.

239
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:50,541
My dove.

240
00:28:51,666 --> 00:28:54,000
I forget you are a simple girl.

241
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,375
You know nothing of the world.

242
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,708
Perhaps I need a husband
who knows the toil of life

243
00:28:59,791 --> 00:29:01,250
and battle as you have.

244
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:04,000
One who has seen the sty.

245
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,125
Hmm.

246
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:11,250
I do know of a fierce and undefeated
young samurai Seki told me of.

247
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,375
Ah, but Seki exaggerates.

248
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,958
"Best swordsman
in the best school," he said.

249
00:29:17,458 --> 00:29:20,250
Won 24 duels with every opponent dead.

250
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:22,041
Not a noble family.

251
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:27,083
A fisherman's son from Kohama,
but his rise reminds me of my own.

252
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:29,500
What was his name again?

253
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,625
Taigen, I believe.

254
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:37,833
If his skills match his reputation,
he'll be offered a handsome salary.

255
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:40,666
Perhaps, even at the castle here,

256
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,875
close to your father.

257
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:47,333
I only hope he's better than I am
at denying you sweets.

258
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,541
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

259
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,666
Gold? Wow. Uh.

260
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:18,625
That's too much. I only brought candy.

261
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:23,291
Have I defeated the undefeatable Taigen?

262
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:28,541
Think of it as an engagement gift.

263
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:31,708
He said yes?

264
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,958
He's sure? You're sure?

265
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:42,583
The lord's daughter
marrying the son of a poor fisherman.

266
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,500
I'd marry you
if you were the son of a poor fish.

267
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:25,208
No new students.
Find another school.

268
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:33,500
I'm not a student.

269
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:36,583
I bring a message
for the master of the Shindo Dojo.

270
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,166
I must deliver it personally.

271
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,041
You may leave any message with me.

272
00:32:41,625 --> 00:32:44,750
What must be said
must be said to the master directly.

273
00:32:45,541 --> 00:32:49,083
I assure you,
what is for the master is for me,

274
00:32:49,833 --> 00:32:54,041
as I assure you
the master does not meet with messengers.

275
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,583
He will for me.

276
00:32:59,833 --> 00:33:02,458
Do you stand before the Shindo School?

277
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:07,333
For 200 years,
we have taught here the Shindo-Ryu,

278
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:10,208
secret methods
passed down from Priest Soto,

279
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:14,875
taught to him on the peak of Mount Kurama
by the mystic Tengu themselves.

280
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:17,041
Show your respect.

281
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:21,500
I must insist.

282
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:27,666
Escort him anywhere you please
that is far from here.

283
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:30,541
Come on, blind beggar.

284
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:34,041
You are bound by hospitality
to feed a traveler within your gates.

285
00:33:34,125 --> 00:33:36,500
I came very far. I'm very hungry.

286
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:39,666
Or has the Shindo Dojo
done away with etiquette?

287
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:41,958
Feed him.

288
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:44,291
Then throw him out.

289
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,125
Eat.

290
00:33:51,541 --> 00:33:52,416
And leave.

291
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:22,166
Show me everything.

292
00:34:23,041 --> 00:34:27,416
To make the right sword, I must know
all that a samurai will do with it.

293
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,291
All his techniques.

294
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,875
But my Shindo-Ryu is secret.

295
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:36,583
Every secret is revealed here.

296
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,500
The sword is the soul of the samurai,

297
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,416
and so it must match the man.

298
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,375
His blade should be rigid and thin.

299
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,583
And gaudy.

300
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:17,666
We fold the steel to blend it.

301
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:22,250
We beat the blend
to remove the impurities.

302
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:25,541
The more pure the steel...

303
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,375
...the harder it is.

304
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:33,125
But too pure, and it becomes brittle.

305
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:38,916
We must leave something
of how God made it.

306
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,916
I thought we must beat out impurity.

307
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,625
Yes, yet an impurity
in the right place is a quality.

308
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:51,041
Soft steel in the center.
Hard steel for the edge.

309
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,916
These together...

310
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,583
...and there can be greatness.

311
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,041
Hmm.

312
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,750
This is good.

313
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:29,333
But it is not perfect.

314
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:35,291
What is a sword?

315
00:36:36,416 --> 00:36:38,500
The soul of a samurai.

316
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:41,666
It is a line.

317
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:44,833
On one side of the line is life.

318
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
The other,

319
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:48,958
death.

320
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,666
The edge we forge
cuts the line between life and death.

321
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,625
Good enough for cooking.

322
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,250
Kitchen knives.

323
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:06,208
Make a thousand kitchen knives.

324
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:10,041
Then you may be ready to make a sword.

325
00:37:12,458 --> 00:37:15,083
A smith signs his name.

326
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,916
All these years, how many fires?

327
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:52,333
No.

328
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:55,583
No man can tame this cursed metal.

329
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,958
Perhaps it does not want to be a sword.

330
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:04,583
All metal wants to be a sword.

331
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:23,916
Oof.

332
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,583
A sword?

333
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:29,291
Are you stealing from me?

334
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:32,416
I'm not stealing.

335
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:35,875
I... am practicing.

336
00:38:36,958 --> 00:38:39,958
Why does a sword maker's apprentice
practice swordplay?

337
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Because I must become a great swordsman.

338
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,541
I must become
the greatest swordsman alive.

339
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,750
Is that all?

340
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,500
And why must you become such a swordsman?

341
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:05,833
Forgive me.

342
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,750
I've kept from you a secret.

343
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,958
One everyone else knows
as plain as my face, but you do not.

344
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,708
I know you're ugly.

345
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,250
What is ugly to me?

346
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,125
{\an8}You are blind

347
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:24,250
{\an8}and so cannot see the shame of my face.

348
00:39:25,666 --> 00:39:26,666
{\an8}I am...

349
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,791
{\an8}made of mixed metal.

350
00:39:31,958 --> 00:39:34,666
{\an8}No amount of hammering
can remove my impurity.

351
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:41,916
At the time I was born,
there were four white men in all of Japan.

352
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:46,416
Men who traded in
weapons and opium and flesh.

353
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,708
<i>One of them took my mother</i>

354
00:39:54,916 --> 00:39:56,041
<i>and made of me...</i>

355
00:40:01,458 --> 00:40:02,500
{\an8}a monster.

356
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,125
{\an8}A creature of shame.

357
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:09,666
{\an8}I do not know their names.

358
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:13,041
{\an8}I do know their fate.

359
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,458
{\an8}They will all die by my hand.
I have vowed this.

360
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:25,333
What have I taught you about steel?

361
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,250
The strongest sword is a blend of steel.

362
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:31,625
Soft and hard.

363
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:34,041
Pure and impure.

364
00:40:35,208 --> 00:40:36,750
You may be something shameful.

365
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:39,333
You may also be strong.

366
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:45,041
You may train at nights.

367
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:54,333
Hey.

368
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:56,625
Come on, beggar boy. Move it.

369
00:41:57,208 --> 00:42:00,583
This will be much simpler
if you allow me to speak with your master.

370
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:02,500
No one sees the master.

371
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:11,416
I cannot leave here
until I speak to the master of this dojo.

372
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,625
Oh, good.

373
00:42:18,166 --> 00:42:19,500
We get to kill you.

374
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:29,250
Argh!

375
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:36,000
How dare you?

376
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:39,083
Be warned. You face my Shindo-Ryu.

377
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:41,250
The problem with Shindo-Ryu is

378
00:42:41,875 --> 00:42:42,958
it's trash.

379
00:42:48,208 --> 00:42:49,208
Hyah!

380
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:59,083
A poor technique.

381
00:43:00,541 --> 00:43:01,625
Easily learned.

382
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,250
Easily defeated.

383
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:07,958
Ugh!

384
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:15,708
The Swallow's Return crumbles

385
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:18,541
against the Fisherman's Net
of the Rogen-Ryu.

386
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:23,125
Hyah! Hyah!

387
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,833
Then you fight with Rogen-Ryu?

388
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:50,666
No.

389
00:43:51,458 --> 00:43:52,458
It is also trash.

390
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:55,333
What school are you?

391
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:56,750
Your name and teacher!

392
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,125
Announce yourself!

393
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:16,416
Hyah!

394
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:42,416
You defeat children and take a bow?

395
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:49,083
Do I duel the mystic Tengu themselves?

396
00:44:49,166 --> 00:44:52,708
Put down that toy and draw your sword!

397
00:44:52,791 --> 00:44:55,500
But... then you'll die.

398
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:00,791
- To Taigen!
- To Taigen!

399
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:02,333
The lord's daughter.

400
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:05,250
His beautiful daughter. Not even ugly.

401
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:08,250
And head of castle security
with 5,000 koku.

402
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:09,500
Who would have thought?

403
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,916
Me.

404
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,583
Taigen, come quick!

405
00:45:15,166 --> 00:45:16,375
We have a problem.

406
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:39,166
Who dares challenge the Shindo Dojo?

407
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,083
I'm afraid no one in this dojo
has offered much of a ch...

408
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:01,166
You're from Kohama Village.

409
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:03,458
Do I know you?

410
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,625
You've climbed some heights

411
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:09,708
to be the prize of a miserable lot.

412
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:13,875
Taigen has won 24 duels.
How many have you won?

413
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,041
Should I have been counting?

414
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:22,416
Kill the son of a bitch, Taigen.
Teach him to respect Shindo.

415
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:27,333
I've come to speak with your master
and will go on my way once I have.

416
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:31,416
You won't go anywhere
except in the funeral cart.

417
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,083
With a naked blade, you'd be dead.

418
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,375
You had a name for me.

419
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:37,000
Taigen. You cannot allow that
to dishonor us or you.

420
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,750
Kill him!

421
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:01,916
Are you afraid to fight with steel?

422
00:48:02,916 --> 00:48:03,916
Thank you.

423
00:48:04,416 --> 00:48:06,416
No one has yet deserved my blade.

424
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,708
You have a blade by Master Eiji?

425
00:49:50,375 --> 00:49:52,500
Death comes for everyone.

426
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:54,458
For you,

427
00:49:55,916 --> 00:49:56,916
today.

428
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,500
Stop!

429
00:51:09,708 --> 00:51:12,958
You are the master of this school?

430
00:51:14,791 --> 00:51:15,791
Hmm.

431
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:20,666
Your students need better training.

432
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:24,166
You have a message for me.

433
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,583
A question.

434
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:34,833
Where may I find your brother,
the black market merchant Heiji Shindo?

435
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:40,708
You did all this to find my brother?

436
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:42,375
Why?

437
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,791
Heiji Shindo is in the fortress
on Tanabe Island,

438
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:51,625
protected by the Genken Clan.

439
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:54,458
Whatever business you have with him,

440
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:56,958
you will never reach him.

441
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:11,166
You're still a dog.

442
00:53:01,583 --> 00:53:03,500
Thank you for my ember.

443
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:09,708
Forgive me
for giving your location, my brother.

444
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,125
He was unstoppable.

445
00:54:14,458 --> 00:54:16,666
He defeated my every student.

446
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:20,500
Hmm. Your students need better training.

447
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:24,166
The samurai, he's not human.

448
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,375
I saw its eyes.

449
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,583
The Four Fangs.

450
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:46,333
Send the Four Fangs after this samurai.

451
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:50,166
Double their price and be done with it.

452
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:22,166
It is time for me to begin my quest.

453
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:27,666
Revenge is like gold. It does not rust.

454
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:29,416
It will wait.

455
00:55:30,916 --> 00:55:31,916
I am ready.

456
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,208
You will get yourself killed.

457
00:55:34,291 --> 00:55:35,500
I am ready.

458
00:55:37,291 --> 00:55:38,291
I am.

459
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:45,291
I can never repay your kindness.

460
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:50,125
When I told you my shame,
you did not disown me,

461
00:55:51,625 --> 00:55:53,833
even though I'm hideous to men's eyes.

462
00:55:55,208 --> 00:55:57,125
I have no eyes, so...

463
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,208
I can accept you.

464
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,291
I will always be grateful to you,

465
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:06,958
Swordfather.

466
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:29,541
{\an8}Before I leave, Swordfather...

467
00:56:31,958 --> 00:56:33,666
{\an8}there's something more I must confess.

468
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,208
You have spoken enough nonsense today.

469
00:56:36,291 --> 00:56:38,125
We cannot part in a lie.

470
00:56:38,208 --> 00:56:40,041
That is your burden to keep.

471
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:42,750
- I have made your swords unclean.
- Quiet!

472
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,916
You came to me as a stupid lost boy.

473
00:56:48,541 --> 00:56:52,166
If you insist on leaving now,
it will be as a stupid lost man.

474
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:08,958
If you must do this,

475
00:57:10,208 --> 00:57:11,458
take a sword.

476
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:17,166
I already have one, Swordfather.

477
00:57:47,375 --> 00:57:48,666
Ah!

478
00:57:55,416 --> 00:57:56,416
Peaches.

479
00:58:05,291 --> 00:58:07,583
<i>This season,
on</i> Blue Eye Samurai...

480
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:10,000
<i>You have enemies now. Rich ones.</i>

481
00:58:11,416 --> 00:58:13,333
<i>All Kyoto is talking about</i>

482
00:58:13,416 --> 00:58:16,291
<i>the unnamed Samurai
who cut through Shindo Dojo.</i>

483
00:58:17,666 --> 00:58:20,291
<i>You will not find
what you seek at my side.</i>

484
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:23,333
I know why you don't want me around,
but you can trust me.

485
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,041
I'd never, ever, ever, ever tell anyone
that you're a g...

486
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:30,166
If I see you again, I will kill you.

487
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,750
The cut is so clean.

488
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:34,875
It's not so bad. We'll be married.

489
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:37,500
<i>Your father
will never allow it now.</i>

490
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:39,791
It wasn't even a duel.
Therefore, you never lost.

491
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:42,083
He must have left a trail.

492
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:46,958
<i>You cost me my station and my honor.</i>

493
00:58:47,041 --> 00:58:49,458
I'll have it all back
when I return with your corpse.

494
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:51,500
<i>I've been a captive my whole life.</i>

495
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:54,208
<i>I won't be locked away
married to a stranger.</i>

496
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:56,166
I just have to find Taigen.

497
00:58:56,708 --> 00:58:58,625
I always dreamt of greatness.

498
00:58:58,708 --> 00:58:59,750
Ahh!

499
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:01,583
<i>You think you can be great?</i>

500
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:06,541
<i>I've actually seen
what greatness looks like.</i>

501
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,041
<i>You don't want revenge.</i>

502
00:59:10,666 --> 00:59:12,458
<i>Revenge does not hesitate.</i>

503
00:59:13,541 --> 00:59:15,583
There's something I need to tell you.

504
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:18,041
<i>Fowler's castle is impenetrable.</i>

505
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:19,833
Some problems you can't kill.

506
00:59:19,916 --> 00:59:21,208
An offer?

507
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,458
You have murder in your eyes.

508
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,416
He deserves to die.

509
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:28,958
<i>Ten years
I've waited for this moment.</i>

510
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:31,333
Your guns will be ready?

511
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:33,208
They are all ready.

512
00:59:35,125 --> 00:59:37,875
I want to see all of you. Show me.

513
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:39,416
Don't hold back.

514
00:59:40,708 --> 00:59:41,916
<i>I'm on the path of revenge.</i>

515
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
<i>There's no place on it
for love or friendship.</i>

516
00:59:45,083 --> 00:59:47,291
<i>I have no interest in money or power.</i>

517
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,875
<i>I have no interest in being happy.</i>

518
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,958
<i>Only satisfied.</i>
