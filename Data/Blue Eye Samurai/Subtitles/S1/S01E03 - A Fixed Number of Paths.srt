1
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:16,250
Ignore her. Do it quick.

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,708
It's only an infant.

3
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:22,333
No, it doesn't even cry.
What child makes no sound?

4
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,416
Just look at it.

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,208
You see? A half-breed.

6
00:00:28,083 --> 00:00:29,083
It's hardly human.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,125
Killing it is a mercy. Do it already.

8
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:38,583
I can't.

9
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:40,583
Oh, coward. I'll do it.

10
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:44,666
No!

11
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,458
Take it.

12
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,041
Take the devil child and go!

13
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:43,500
Get off of my master!
What did you do to him?

14
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,291
Not me. Not me! The Fangs.

15
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:50,916
Master, no.

16
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:01,500
Don't touch him.

17
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,500
There's a shrine up the mountain.

18
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:12,416
He'll be safe there.

19
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:42,583
No, Mizu! No one can see your face.

20
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:47,375
The bad men will find you.
If that door opens, we die.

21
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,750
Dead?

22
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,625
Which one of the Four Fangs is dead?

23
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:12,208
All of them.

24
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,125
All Four Fangs.

25
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,208
You solve the problem.

26
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,750
Is that an order?

27
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:39,000
Ten years I've waited for this moment.

28
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,208
Ten years of planning

29
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,083
to make our control
of the shogunate absolute.

30
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:46,833
It's right there.

31
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:51,666
On the bed, cheeks parted, waiting.

32
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,458
And you want me to gift my attention

33
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,583
to some malformed half-breed

34
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,708
who's handy with a sword.

35
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:07,291
So, if you might, my dear, dear friend,

36
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:11,041
my trusted partner and clear equal,

37
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:16,041
my right hand
and both feet on land, fondest heart,

38
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:19,166
spare a cup of concern
towards our purpose.

39
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,916
And do it your fucking self.

40
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,708
Prepare a tea ceremony.

41
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,916
Hmm.

42
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,791
Hmm. Making soup now?

43
00:04:58,625 --> 00:04:59,708
Medicine.

44
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,416
It will heal him.

45
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:03,125
It better.

46
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,041
If he dies, you die.

47
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:11,208
That one's poison.

48
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,250
Snowcap. One bite... Dehh.

49
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,875
Two bites... Ekkk.

50
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:22,083
Drink this.

51
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:24,916
See?

52
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,750
Useful.

53
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:43,291
You can barely stand,
let alone hold that sword for long.

54
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:48,000
I didn't kill you
when I easily could have.

55
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:52,291
Now put that down and sit.
I'm nearly finished.

56
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,333
It's a contract for a duel.

57
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:05,375
The rematch you owe me
to be registered, legal, and witnessed.

58
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,166
Only thing left is the date.

59
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,708
How many days do you need
before you're well enough to die?

60
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:14,000
You barely survived our last match.

61
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,625
That was no match.
You're nowhere near my level.

62
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:20,250
Hmm. I like your hair.

63
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:24,375
I was blind drunk when we fought.
I was celebrating my engagement.

64
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:27,000
- Congratulations.
- Which is now broken.

65
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:30,125
You cost me my station and my honor.

66
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,041
I'll have it all back
when I return with your corpse.

67
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:33,958
How long?

68
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,291
Two days.

69
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,416
Make it three.

70
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,416
If you wanted me dead, you should've
struck when you had the chance.

71
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,666
The time to kill your enemy
is when you can.

72
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,791
There would be no honor in that.

73
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,708
You don't want revenge. You want a party.

74
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,583
When I find the men I've set out to kill,

75
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,583
I promise you I won't waste
a second on ceremony.

76
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,333
Then you are not a samurai at all.

77
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:03,291
Still a stray dog eating out of my trash.

78
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,458
Three days.

79
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,208
More medicine.

80
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,333
The first brought your fever down.

81
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:22,500
This one will speed your healing
and rebuild your strength.

82
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,416
It has vegetables, cod liver, herbs...

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh...

84
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,416
Mm-hmm.

85
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,166
Master Eiji's broken blade
is a good fit for him.

86
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:51,958
Hmm.

87
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:38,833
"As I trust you are a man of honor,
I hope you can credit the same of me."

88
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:43,125
"If you would follow my man, Okiyama,
he will lead you to a medial place

89
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,458
where we can,
in common safety, meet for tea."

90
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:49,083
"Please accept this gift
as a token of sincerity

91
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,291
from one eager for your acquaintance."

92
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,666
"From Heiji Shindo."

93
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,791
Whoa. Wait. Where are you going?

94
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,500
- For tea.
- There's no tea.

95
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:08,625
You know that, right?
He's leading you to an ambush.

96
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,041
Hey, I need you alive!

97
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,458
We have a contract, remember?

98
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:18,625
No one gets to kill you but me.

99
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,750
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Right! Left!

100
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,791
I'm on a horse!

101
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,958
There is no possibility
this will be anything other than a trap.

102
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,666
Heiji Shindo will be there.

103
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,625
He is a direct line
to one of the men I am sworn to kill.

104
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:52,000
Revenge does not hesitate.

105
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,541
Chilly.

106
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,500
Is it?

107
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:15,333
You're not used to travel or the cold.

108
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,375
You need extra provisions to keep warm.

109
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:22,208
I have hot tea and money.
Provisions enough for anyone.

110
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,000
The roads are full of danger, child.

111
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:30,708
If we turn back now,
your father will never know you left.

112
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:33,291
You can be on your way to Edo.

113
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:37,250
The real danger is in Edo.
I have a precise plan to avoid it.

114
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,125
I have four days till Father calls on me
to leave for the wedding.

115
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,083
That gives me two days to find Taigen,

116
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,791
one day to make sure
he fights his demon samurai,

117
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,541
and one day to bring him back
with his honor restored.

118
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,750
Hmm.

119
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:53,708
I remember a case
when I was a young counsel.

120
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:57,916
An insane monk went around
freeing pigs from the farms

121
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,875
believing he was saving them
from a cruel prandial fate.

122
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,375
The pigs ran into the woods
squealing with the shock of freedom.

123
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,625
Most ended up
being ripped to shreds by wolves.

124
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,375
The rest starved.

125
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,708
And the villagers went hungry that winter.

126
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,708
Why do men keep comparing me to pigs?

127
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:23,750
I mean to say,
there are only so many paths

128
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:27,166
available to each man and each girl.

129
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,750
Fight within your confines,
not against them.

130
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,125
I am not out here to learn a lesson.

131
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,916
Brigands.

132
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,500
You're about to learn a lesson.

133
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,000
Count to ten,
then climb out that window. Run.

134
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,791
Gentlemen, you have made
a poor choice in stopping us.

135
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:02,875
Your expectations,
I assure you, are not worth your efforts.

136
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,208
Just take my purse and go.
I have nothing else of value.

137
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,958
Just some rice balls
and tea for my journey.

138
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:11,166
I could eat.

139
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,500
Been some time since I killed a man.

140
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,458
I wonder if I still remember how.

141
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,750
Those pretty feet sure run fast.

142
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,000
But not fast enough.

143
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,916
You're lucky I'm not a man.

144
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,458
The other shoe, princess.

145
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,166
- Are you...
- I'm fine.

146
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,666
What did you use to say?

147
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,708
If one god forsakes you,
another one will help you.

148
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,333
My friend.

149
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,291
Might you spare a ride to Kyoto?

150
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:20,375
Not Kyoto!

151
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:24,166
Mihonoseki, on the coast.
It's important I be there by morning.

152
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,250
I can pay.

153
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:27,666
Hmm.

154
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:08,583
They scattered
white flowers on the Buddha,

155
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:14,750
and the flowers they scattered
were piled as high as Mount Sumeru.

156
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,750
I didn't see a mountain
until I was 12 and ran away from home.

157
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,791
Nothing there but cliffs and boats.

158
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:36,833
Fish guts and fish minds.

159
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:38,916
Do you remember Kohama?

160
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,750
Why would you? I try to forget it.

161
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,750
My father lived and died

162
00:14:46,833 --> 00:14:49,708
by how many fish he caught
in his net before sunrise.

163
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,541
Enough fish, and he could drink his fill.

164
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,708
Not enough, he beat me instead.

165
00:14:58,166 --> 00:15:00,958
And I could smell the cod on his fists.

166
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,833
I smelled it on him on his deathbed.

167
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,375
Eighty-four thousand Dharma doors.

168
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,958
For me, there were only two.

169
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,250
The net or the sword.

170
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:17,666
I could become my father,
or I could cut my way free of the net.

171
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,416
And I could forget all about Kohama.

172
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,541
I remember Kohama.

173
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:06,250
He needs a weapon to kill you
like you need two hands to piss.

174
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,833
He could bite you in half while you sleep.

175
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,416
All of it.

176
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:12,833
Master.

177
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,541
Well, I guess I'll just relax
and wait to be ambushed.

178
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:24,583
Or maybe we'll get lucky,
and tomorrow we meet Heiji Shindo for tea,

179
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,375
only there won't be any tea.

180
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:30,041
There'll be an army of soldiers
to cut you into tiny slices,

181
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,875
none of which can duel me.

182
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,875
If you prefer, I can kill you now.

183
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:40,375
Why'd you let me follow you, hmm?
Revenge doesn't hesitate.

184
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,083
You need me because you're weak.

185
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,750
Still a malnourished urchin on the street.

186
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:51,583
I can beat you with any weapon you choose.

187
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:53,666
A spear.

188
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,166
A rock.

189
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,541
Master, your stitches.

190
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,583
The bad men will find you.

191
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,666
If that door opens, we die.

192
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:10,208
The village kids used to scare
each other with stories about you.

193
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,541
The hut at the end of the woods,

194
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:16,083
where the monster boy lived
with his whore mother.

195
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,541
We dared each other to touch the door.

196
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:37,291
Until one day it was gone.

197
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:41,208
You let them see you?
Men will come. Men will always come.

198
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,791
Then you were a dog on our streets,

199
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,041
living on gutter scraps.

200
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:55,125
Mizu! Mizu!

201
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,083
Huh.

202
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,916
Your round.

203
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,458
Ahh. I'll get my needle and thread.

204
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,541
Whoa! Whoa!

205
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:36,541
You know, you picked a ridiculous master,

206
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,125
but you take good care of him.

207
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:44,750
Hmm. I tell you what.
After I kill him, you come work for me.

208
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,041
You can't be my apprentice.

209
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:50,458
I mean, look at you,
half-limb to a half-wit.

210
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:54,541
But I'll certainly
make a place for you in my kitchens.

211
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,166
Oh, I could never work for you.

212
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,958
I always dreamt of greatness.

213
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:03,833
Gave every coin I ever collected
to the <i>saisen</i> box with a prayer on it.

214
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,750
You think you can be great?

215
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,375
As it says,
there are four paths through the world.

216
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:14,750
The way of the farmer, the artisan,
the merchant, and the warrior.

217
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,708
Each of these can lead to greatness.

218
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:21,000
I never even cared which path,
so long as I found mine.

219
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,166
I mean, I thought I'd
at least reach noodle greatness.

220
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,875
But now I've actually seen
what greatness looks like.

221
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:34,333
And I know I can't touch greatness
any more than I could swallow the sun,

222
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:36,541
but I can help.

223
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:39,958
I can help greatness.

224
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,750
What? I'm great!

225
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,166
Oh no. No, thank you.
We're not going in that death trap.

226
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,500
Heiji Shindo is this way?

227
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,875
Then I go this way.

228
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:22,041
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

229
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,083
I'm the only one who gets to kill him.

230
00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:28,458
So if he's walking in
to meet certain death,

231
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:32,750
I'll be there to keep him and death
from getting too friendly. Got it?

232
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,333
Hold.

233
00:21:37,916 --> 00:21:38,916
You talk?

234
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,583
"Meet me for tea. It'll be fun."

235
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,458
It opens up here. Get ready.

236
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,291
Hello!

237
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:36,875
Huh.

238
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:39,458
I was just in the mood for tea.

239
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,375
It's still a trap.

240
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:47,541
Akemi! Akemi! Time to get out.

241
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,875
This isn't Mihonoseki.

242
00:22:56,958 --> 00:23:00,250
We're nowhere near.
You took us further than when we started!

243
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:03,958
Hyah!
Then you better start walking!

244
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,291
After we paid him!

245
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:10,958
It's called taking someone
for a ride.

246
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,500
We're a day's walk
the opposite way.

247
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:14,416
Two.

248
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,541
What do we do?

249
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,375
We have no money.
No way of getting anywhere.

250
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:22,250
I'm going to freeze to death out here.
Covered in shit!

251
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:29,375
I wish we were back home.

252
00:23:34,416 --> 00:23:35,833
Enough to get us there.

253
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,500
You had that all along?

254
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:43,458
You knew we'd end up like this?
And I'd give up?

255
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:46,333
Child, who taught you to paint,

256
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:49,833
to read, to wash, to dance?

257
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,125
I know you.

258
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,750
You're like an orchid.

259
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:58,208
Lovely and singular
but suited for neither frost nor fry.

260
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:02,041
And stubborn
as to when to bloom to reason.

261
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:05,000
{\an8}Now, thankfully you have.

262
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:08,041
{\an8}Let's hire a horse and go home.

263
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,541
I can still find Taigen.

264
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,583
You took a gamble on Taigen and lost.

265
00:24:13,666 --> 00:24:17,583
Now we have to secure
the next best available outcome,

266
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:21,750
and that is in Edo,
married to the shogun's son.

267
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,041
I wouldn't have brought
your father the match

268
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:27,416
if I didn't think
it was the best thing for you.

269
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:32,000
You. You brought in the shogun's man.

270
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:36,250
This is the world.
It grants women a fixed number of paths.

271
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:39,541
Proper wife or improper whore.

272
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:43,000
Don't be shocked.
You're not a child anymore.

273
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:45,166
You have to see things as they are.

274
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:48,208
Yes, I picked a path for you.

275
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:50,875
You sold me to a rich man's son.

276
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,916
How's that any different
than being a whore?

277
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,125
In a tavern like that right now

278
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:57,500
are purveyors and flesh-traders

279
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,708
traveling village to village
for girls to buy.

280
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:05,291
And girls are bought,
sold by their own families.

281
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:07,750
Ask them if it's different.

282
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:12,583
There is happiness to be stolen
as a wife to the right man.

283
00:25:12,666 --> 00:25:14,166
Even to the wrong one.

284
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,791
Bits and pieces, over time.

285
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,958
To find out only now

286
00:25:23,291 --> 00:25:24,791
you never believed in me.

287
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:28,916
Akemi!

288
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,333
These feet were never meant
for the open road.

289
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:52,708
So soft, like... fresh tofu.

290
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:53,791
Akemi.

291
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,625
What is this?

292
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:59,916
You old goat, stop following me.
You can't afford me.

293
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,041
My fans follow me everywhere.

294
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:04,916
I just left
Shimabara's most exclusive brothel

295
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
to find employment somewhere
worthy of my talents as a courtesan.

296
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,416
You'd fetch an astronomical price!

297
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,583
I've been a purveyor all my life.
Plenty of girls pretend to be a princess.

298
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,291
You really could be one.

299
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:19,708
I never sold a girl
half as elegant as you.

300
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:21,666
No one has.

301
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:26,000
My koto playing once brought
an entire room of samurai to orgasm.

302
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,083
Hmph.

303
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,250
Didn't have to lift my hem.

304
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,708
That's enough. Akemi, come with me.

305
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,958
Take your shriveled old dick
and go cry for some other girl.

306
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,416
This one's in Goro's care now.

307
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:44,458
You were saying
you don't have a contract now?

308
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:47,625
My last employer
tried to have me entertain a man

309
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:49,666
I knew would raise a hand to me.

310
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,791
He told me a woman has no choice
but to accept her fate.

311
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:58,083
{\an8}But I know there's another path.
One I choose for myself.

312
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:03,166
{\an8}I hear there's a fine parlor
in Mihonoseki.

313
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,083
Oh, miss. You are in luck!

314
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,458
You need someone to negotiate for you.

315
00:27:07,541 --> 00:27:09,250
Get you the best price!

316
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,166
Goro knows everyone.

317
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,291
All the best brothels from Kyoto to Edo,

318
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,458
uh, or Mihonoseki if you like.

319
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:19,250
We can be there in a day!

320
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:23,291
You take my horse. Please.
Have to keep those feet supple.

321
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:32,750
Akemi, you don't know what you're doing.

322
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:58,416
In my youth,
I saw enough flawless swordsmen

323
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
to know I'd never be one.

324
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,125
I put my effort into other arts.

325
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,208
Commerce. Tea.

326
00:28:05,958 --> 00:28:09,458
That kettle has been
in the Shindo clan for 300 years.

327
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:11,000
Beautiful ironwork.

328
00:28:12,625 --> 00:28:14,125
We have no secrets here.

329
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:26,166
You were meant to be alone.
Fair. You expected an attack.

330
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,208
I am unarmed,
but for a small knife to cut bean cake.

331
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,666
We have our swords.

332
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:37,750
Maybe I have 500 archers
hidden in the cliffs around us.

333
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:46,416
You are Heiji Shindo.

334
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:50,541
{\an8}You trade in flesh, opium, chiefly guns.

335
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:53,375
{\an8}Middleman to illegal traders
from the West.

336
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,250
You have been looking for me.

337
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:57,583
For a man you are connected with.

338
00:28:57,666 --> 00:28:59,708
I am connected with many men.

339
00:29:00,375 --> 00:29:01,916
The white man.

340
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:05,500
There are no white men in Japan.

341
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:08,708
That's the law.
No one would break the law.

342
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:14,625
Abijah Fowler.

343
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,375
{\an8}Abijah Fowler.

344
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:22,125
{\an8}That is his name.

345
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:25,333
And what business do you have with Fowler?

346
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:29,541
He was one of the three white men
who were in Japan when I was born.

347
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,125
I will kill all three of them.

348
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,625
There were four white men
when you were born.

349
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,625
There are three now.

350
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:40,791
Hmm.

351
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:43,750
Fowler and I have dealings.

352
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,625
Long-standing arrangements.

353
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:48,958
Your business is unimportant.

354
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:52,750
You can't muster
the appearance of concern for your host?

355
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:56,416
I look your way and don't even see you.

356
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,458
Mm.

357
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:05,666
You mean to kill my partner.
I am bidden to prevent that.

358
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,083
I sent the Four Fangs.

359
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:10,125
I killed the Four Fangs.

360
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:14,375
That proves you formidable, uncommonly.

361
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:18,208
Now I can keep hiring more
and more expensive cutthroats,

362
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:22,541
and you can keep killing them,
which will cost us money, and you, time.

363
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,541
This benefits no one.

364
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,000
But you're lucky.

365
00:30:26,791 --> 00:30:29,541
I am wise. Experienced.

366
00:30:29,625 --> 00:30:32,166
I know some problems
you simply can't kill.

367
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:34,125
An offer.

368
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,708
A very pretty one.

369
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:39,000
Fifty thousand ryo.

370
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:44,083
And we appoint you
the new lord of the Sendai-han.

371
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,625
Rich in lumber, sake, and silk.

372
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,125
The current lord is a debauch.

373
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:52,375
The shogun will appoint
a successor at our request.

374
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:54,708
He does most things at our request.

375
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,000
I have the letters prepared.

376
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,000
Lord Mizu of Sendai. Why not?

377
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,333
In return,

378
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:04,208
you would have to offer an assurance

379
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:07,083
you will let go
of all ill intention toward me...

380
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,250
and Fowler.

381
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:11,500
An assurance.

382
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:14,625
Well, it's a small thing.
Nothing at all, really.

383
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,500
Your right thumb.

384
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:19,833
I take it with me as a promise

385
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:22,875
that you will never
grasp a sword against us again.

386
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,750
Your knife cuts more than bean cake.

387
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,416
There's no shame in it.

388
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,041
Many of the most powerful lords
have reason to wear long sleeves.

389
00:31:37,125 --> 00:31:41,583
Oh, hold on, hold on.
You owe me a fight first. Me.

390
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,333
What do you think they're doing?

391
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
You cook?

392
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,791
Then cook.

393
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,416
I refuse.

394
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,750
I have no interest in money or power.

395
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:28,083
I have no interest in being happy.

396
00:32:28,166 --> 00:32:29,500
Only satisfied.

397
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,875
This you expected.

398
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:37,000
Did I?

399
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,333
A man for whom commerce is art.

400
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,666
This you planned for

401
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:44,250
with an attack or a second offer.

402
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:46,083
Perhaps not so pretty.

403
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:53,416
If I may, how do you intend
to reach Fowler in his island castle?

404
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,958
Through the front door.

405
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,125
Really. He would.

406
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,125
He won't.

407
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:02,666
As a white man, Fowler is tolerated
only so long as he remains unseen.

408
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,083
Fowler's castle is impenetrable.

409
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,875
<i>To reach him,
you'd have to cross violent waters.</i>

410
00:33:09,791 --> 00:33:12,416
<i>Eight levels to reach his chamber
at the top,</i>

411
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:14,958
<i>each with a signature defense.</i>

412
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,458
And there is no door.

413
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,833
The defenses are absolute.

414
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:24,166
If you attempt an assault,
you'll die before you see his face.

415
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:27,791
Unless someone were to help you.

416
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,583
Commerce.

417
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:33,916
Personal. You want to kill Fowler.
I want my partnership with him ended.

418
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,625
I can get you inside the castle.

419
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:36,708
How?

420
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:43,416
A sake barrel.

421
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,250
You want him to get in that?

422
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,958
The ride will be long and horrible.

423
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:52,125
But upon my return to the castle,
having failed to negotiate with you,

424
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:54,916
the ten casks of sake
I purchased along the way

425
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,875
will be set in the kitchen stores.

426
00:33:57,458 --> 00:33:59,833
You're not actually considering
getting in that.

427
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:03,875
Any path
that leads me to Fowler is a good one.

428
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,166
That fever must've cooked your brain.

429
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,458
That's not a cask. It's a coffin!

430
00:34:08,541 --> 00:34:10,458
He probably has a room full of barrels

431
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:13,625
stuffed with dead,
shriveled, stupid enemies.

432
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:16,833
I have questions.

433
00:34:17,375 --> 00:34:18,500
You must.

434
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:21,000
How do I trust
you don't leave me in there to die?

435
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:23,916
You weigh
the inane complexity of that plan

436
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,375
against the simpler ambush you expected.

437
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:29,375
Why do you want Fowler dead
when he makes you so rich,

438
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:31,458
you can bribe me with 50,000 ryo?

439
00:34:31,541 --> 00:34:33,125
My reasons are my own.

440
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:37,708
No. No, they're not.

441
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:42,083
Twenty years of that face.

442
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,583
That stink.

443
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,875
I hate him.

444
00:34:48,625 --> 00:34:50,125
I hate him so much.

445
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:55,083
{\an8}Hmm. Why does the sake smell

446
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:56,791
bad?

447
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:59,083
He wants to die in a fancy barrel.

448
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:02,708
Ah. That's the cheap sake
we serve to the prostitutes.

449
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:06,916
If you'd like, I have a cask
of my preferred sake. It's very dry.

450
00:35:07,458 --> 00:35:08,583
I have a question.

451
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:12,125
Let's say he gets through all that
and guts your white man.

452
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,083
How does he get out of the castle?

453
00:35:17,041 --> 00:35:18,333
I can guarantee your life

454
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,291
within a blade's length
of Abijah Fowler's neck.

455
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,333
Our business ends there.

456
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,541
I wish you luck in your escape.

457
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,750
A final question.

458
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:34,666
That flower.

459
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:38,791
Who cut that flower?

460
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,333
{\an8}The line is exquisite.

461
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:46,083
Only a master could make that cut.

462
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,125
It couldn't have been you.

463
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:49,791
Enough questions.

464
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,333
Get in the barrel.

465
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:55,000
What happens if I refuse?

466
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:56,833
You can't.

467
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,041
I told you the truth about our situation
except on one point.

468
00:36:01,583 --> 00:36:02,708
I'm not here alone.

469
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:07,041
On the cliffs surrounding this vale
are 500 of my best archers.

470
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:10,458
My small joke earlier was no joke.

471
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,041
It is an ambush. See?

472
00:36:13,541 --> 00:36:16,833
If you refuse to step in the cask,
I drop this ribbon,

473
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:20,416
which is the signal for my archers
to blot the sun with their arrows,

474
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,916
and you die where you stand.

475
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:27,000
And Fowler lives.
Knowing him, probably forever.

476
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,333
- Now get in.
- No!

477
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:30,916
You can't get in there.
There aren't any archers...

478
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Shut up! You have no choice.

479
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:36,708
Get in! Get in or die now!

480
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:57,041
For a minute, I thought you believed him.
There aren't any archers.

481
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,708
You bed with the devil.

482
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:24,083
Huh. He wasn't lying.

483
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,541
They're reloading. Count!

484
00:37:31,125 --> 00:37:35,083
One, two, three, four...

485
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:41,083
...five, six, seven, eight.

486
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,166
Bad sign.

487
00:38:09,625 --> 00:38:13,208
Reloading. Two, three, four,

488
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,416
five, six, seven, eight.

489
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:32,916
Two, three, four...

490
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:44,458
Hyah!

491
00:38:47,083 --> 00:38:48,083
Snowcap.

492
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,291
...five, six, seven, eight!

493
00:39:10,958 --> 00:39:12,333
We'll never make it.

494
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,416
We're trapped.

495
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:17,041
- Two, three...
- Stop counting seconds till we die.

496
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:20,875
Hell with it.
Hold me over your head and run.

497
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,166
No reason for us both to die.

498
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,541
Ringo.

499
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:42,958
Useful.

500
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:05,916
This guy!

501
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,666
Some greatness in you, after all.
What did you do to the giant?

502
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,875
Your shielding. That was...

503
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:23,125
Your timing. You're deeply skilled.

504
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:25,166
The broken blade fits well in your hand.

505
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,500
Well, it's yours.

506
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:30,291
You won it.

507
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,833
You were never getting in that barrel.

508
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,416
Men like him like to talk so much,

509
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,541
they eventually tell you
how to destroy them.

510
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:44,458
He told you how to get into the castle!

511
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:47,875
How? What was it? The flower?

512
00:40:47,958 --> 00:40:49,291
The cheap sake.

513
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,500
The prostitutes!

514
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:58,541
{\an8}You know,
it's a shame our duel's set for tomorrow.

515
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,083
{\an8}I have to kill you
before you can get your reven...

516
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:15,791
The man I met...

517
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:18,708
is no man.

518
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:21,416
A demon.

519
00:41:21,958 --> 00:41:23,708
Eyes empty.

520
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,125
Eyes like yours.

521
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:29,583
Nothing can stop him.

522
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,958
He'll come.

523
00:41:32,875 --> 00:41:36,291
<i>He'll stand right here,
and he will open your throat.</i>

524
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,000
<i>He'll watch you die.</i>

525
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:52,500
<i>Your skill as a swordsman
merits an opponent</i>

526
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:54,375
<i>with full strength and focus.</i>

527
00:41:55,083 --> 00:41:58,666
<i>I will be able to supply you with both
after I have fulfilled my task.</i>

528
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:03,250
<i>On the second day of autumn,
I will meet you at the appointed shrine,</i>

529
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,666
<i>and you shall have the duel you deserve.</i>

530
00:42:10,916 --> 00:42:11,916
Thank you.

531
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:25,500
<i>As a surety, please accept this blade
which so well suits your hand.</i>

532
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,333
I want to know

533
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:44,291
everything there is to know
about your demon.

534
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,541
I only know his name.

535
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:48,916
Mizu.

536
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:51,875
But someone knows more.

537
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,166
He will tell us everything.
