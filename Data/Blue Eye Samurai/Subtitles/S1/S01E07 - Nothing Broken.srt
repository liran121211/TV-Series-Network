1
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:11,541
Hello?

2
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:13,875
Hello in there!

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,250
Please. You have to help us.

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,250
I have dying people or...
Maybe they're already dead.

5
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,708
I'm too scared to look,
but I'm trying to save them,

6
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,166
even though I'm really mad at one of them.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,791
I think you know him.

8
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:30,500
Please! I've been walking for days,
and bad guys are after us,

9
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,291
and I don't know where else to go.

10
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,500
What do I do?

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,250
Mizu.

12
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,500
Come inside.

13
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:09,916
My cage. So many years.

14
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:13,958
Took them forever
to build a proper jakes.

15
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,708
Made the shogun unspeakably rich,
and all I had to do was hide.

16
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,666
I spun so much gold in there.

17
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:23,458
Fucked 10,000 times.

18
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,500
I never want to see it again.

19
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:29,166
Adieu!

20
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,833
Our spring procession to Edo.

21
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,125
You promised we wouldn't be bored.

22
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:50,333
We won't be.

23
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:53,041
Every night, a delicacy.

24
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:56,041
I'm glad to see
you got your appetite back.

25
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,000
You lost an arm, not your prick.

26
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:03,541
Ha. We, uh, should send word
of when the weapons arrive.

27
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,458
Our friends are nervous.

28
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,250
Ah, let them be nervous.

29
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,375
When they stop worrying,
they stop thinking they need us.

30
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,875
But you do know when.

31
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,083
Now, what's planned for tonight?

32
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:04,041
That is... something new.

33
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,083
Pleasure as always,

34
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,250
Madame Kaji.

35
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,625
Always a pleasure to serve you.

36
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,208
Safest travels to Edo.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,375
Heiji Shindo, you promised, you delivered.

38
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:22,666
Every stop a surprise and a delight.

39
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,333
I like to think
we gain strength from pleasure.

40
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:29,833
But our army is nothing without guns.

41
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,750
Ah, you worry like an old woman.

42
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:36,666
I worry like someone about to go to war
with the entire shogunate.

43
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,500
Ah, the guns will be smuggled in

44
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:41,541
on fishing boats in two days.

45
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,291
Clever.

46
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,166
Our army will take the castle,

47
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,375
and I'll personally execute

48
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,125
the shogun and the entire Itoh Clan

49
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,166
during the Council of Elders
at the Spring Matsuri.

50
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,958
The lords can then choose.

51
00:03:58,041 --> 00:04:01,416
Die with him or bow to my puppet,

52
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:06,500
who will take his orders from me!

53
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,875
I didn't say stop.

54
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,750
<i>The shipment comes in two days.</i>

55
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,750
<i>Scour every port and fish yard.
Search every boat.</i>

56
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:35,208
<i>Open every box.
Bribe any man at any price.</i>

57
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,750
<i>We must get the guns before Fowler.</i>

58
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:43,291
<i>Once you've secured them,
it will be my privilege to kill Fowler.</i>

59
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:47,333
"That man would be a plague on Japan.
There is no sharing power with him."

60
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,875
Find those guns before they reach Edo.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,458
Bring them to me. Now.

62
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,916
The convergence of your wedding
and the Spring Matsuri.

63
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:06,916
The timing couldn't be more perfect
if I planned it myself.

64
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:08,750
Ah!

65
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:12,125
Every lord has brought us their finest.

66
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,416
Find a smile.

67
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:20,375
What can you possibly want
that isn't right here?

68
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,875
I want to not be forced
to marry some horrible man I don't know.

69
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,750
I want to leave Edo.

70
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,750
Daughter.

71
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:34,375
When in your whole life
have you not gotten what you wanted?

72
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:36,166
When you blackened my teeth.

73
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:39,625
Just... trust me.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hello, friend.

75
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,291
How long have you been in there?

76
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:13,041
Hmm?

77
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,583
Too long. It's spring outside.

78
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:51,375
A bird that small, caught on the wing.

79
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,791
I tell you, you were born to kill.

80
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,583
Ugh! You saw something beautiful,
and your first thought was to kill it.

81
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,250
You're as cruel as they say.

82
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,916
You have nothing to say for yourself?

83
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:30,333
You are bold to speak
to the young master so plainly.

84
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,625
Bold is unwise.

85
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:34,416
A wife should be like tofu.

86
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,583
Unnoticed, colorless,
and bland.

87
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:40,791
He's as terrible as they say.
He won't even talk to me.

88
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:46,041
Oh, the young master doesn't converse
with any woman. Lady Itoh's rule.

89
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,416
His first wife wishes she followed it.

90
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,750
- What happened to her?
- Oh, she went back to her family.

91
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,833
In an urn.

92
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,958
He is as ruthless in bed as in battle.

93
00:07:56,041 --> 00:07:57,958
Your fiancé's favorite position?

94
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,958
With an obi around her neck.

95
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:30,375
Akemi! Heavens, child.

96
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,000
Get away from that window.

97
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:36,291
This is your ambition now? Death?

98
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,166
Is there another way out?

99
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,125
It's the window or the knife.
Or wait for an obi.

100
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:46,208
Save your worries, Seki.
Sadly, I lack the courage.

101
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:47,791
Go away.

102
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,416
I don't need your advice
on marriage or love

103
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,666
or whatever you think
you're an expert on today.

104
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,250
Hmm.

105
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:58,000
I've never understood a thing about love,

106
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,500
or battle, or politics, or art,

107
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,583
or anything I was supposed to.

108
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:05,791
I was a miserable warrior.

109
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:13,166
The only thing I have ever known
everything about is you.

110
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,958
Here. A gift from me.

111
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
A Go set?

112
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,583
We stopped playing when I was 12.

113
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,083
Why?

114
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,541
Because I beat you every time.

115
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,083
Why?

116
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,791
Because you learned.

117
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,875
You're determined to resent me

118
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:44,375
when what you resent
is being someone else's property.

119
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,125
Women shouldn't be property.

120
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,666
Well, they are.

121
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:51,958
And tomorrow, you go
from your father's to Master Takayoshi's.

122
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,625
I've always known this day would come.

123
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,958
Since your mother died,

124
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,166
I tried with the time I had

125
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,916
to ready you for the world that is,

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,583
not the world you'd have it be.

127
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,791
Without your father knowing,

128
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,666
often without you knowing.

129
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,083
You think you sneaked into the library
to read all those years?

130
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,625
Why do you think you wanted to?

131
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,458
Know it or not,

132
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:30,000
you are equipped
to do more than survive here...

133
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:33,500
but succeed.

134
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,083
Expand your territory.

135
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,000
Find the vulnerabilities. Capture.

136
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,125
Win.

137
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,458
You learned.

138
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,250
You can stop pretending to be my mother.

139
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,708
After tomorrow,
I won't be your responsibility ever again.

140
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,875
Blame me if you must.

141
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,375
Hate me.

142
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,375
I was no better a mother
than I was a warrior.

143
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,375
I did enjoy the job more.

144
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,083
Hmm. Someone is awake.

145
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,625
Tell me if Taigen ever wakes up.

146
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:03,458
Thanks to your apprentice,
you did not die.

147
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,208
Your soul is stubborn.

148
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,041
I'm not Mizu's apprentice.

149
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,083
Will Taigen live?

150
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:20,000
Hmm. His soul is also stubborn.

151
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,541
How can I help you today, Master?

152
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,392
I washed your clothes. You probably
didn't know they were so dirty.

153
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,125
They will look so much nicer now.
And white.

154
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,648
Did you know they're actually white?

155
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,833
The legendary Master Eiji
deserves clean white underwear.

156
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:42,416
Especially if he's gonna train me.

157
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:43,916
Hmm.

158
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,500
You can help me by providing silence.

159
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,541
My dad loved silence too.

160
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,041
You're alive.

161
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,375
Everything hurts.

162
00:12:58,458 --> 00:12:59,625
That's a good sign.

163
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,500
Salt and fish guts.

164
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,875
Kohama?

165
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,000
Near it.

166
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:12,541
This is Master Eiji's forge.

167
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,958
So this is where you disappeared to
all those years ago.

168
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,458
This is where you trained.

169
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:21,916
No one in town cared if I starved or died.

170
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,416
He took me in.

171
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,708
Rest. I'll be back.

172
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,333
Wait. You have to let me thank you
for saving me.

173
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,583
It's hard enough to admit you did.

174
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,083
You don't owe me anything.

175
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:50,375
Lady Itoh hoped
a ride would lighten Miss's mood.

176
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,375
Look at the trees.

177
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,708
It's as if they bloomed
especially for the wedding.

178
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:59,041
Even the prostitutes
are working night and day.

179
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,333
Stop! Stop here.

180
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:14,250
You're a long way from home.

181
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:16,208
Yes, Madame Kaji.

182
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,083
It's me.
Or do I have to recite some renga?

183
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:23,291
Akemi?

184
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:26,000
Akemi! You have wife teeth.

185
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:31,000
Every paying customer in the country
is in Edo for the Spring Matsuri

186
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,875
and some lavish royal wedding.

187
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,208
We rented rooms
at a tea house here in the Yoshiwara.

188
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,500
We worked the whole highway getting here.

189
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:42,458
Fucked our way through
all 69 Stations of the Nakasendo.

190
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:47,083
But why are you here?
And in the shogun's crest?

191
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:51,875
Oh. The lavish royal wedding,
it seems, is... mine.

192
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:56,041
Wait. That wedding is your wedding?

193
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,916
She really is a real princess.

194
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,708
Of course she is.
Bet she lives in a castle.

195
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,958
I'm in a snare, surrounded by snakes.

196
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,541
I will trade lives with you right now.

197
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:14,375
We've been servicing
the road-weary crotches of every man here

198
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,333
to pay obeisance to your new family.

199
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,541
You need only service one, freshly washed.

200
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,875
You don't understand.

201
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,333
That he's a beast? He's weak.

202
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:28,083
He's a man. All men are weak.

203
00:15:28,625 --> 00:15:30,833
The ones who act beastly are weakest.

204
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,625
They penetrate women
and think that makes them powerful.

205
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,125
Really, their pricks are fragile.

206
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,916
Exposed. You saw it yourself.

207
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,833
They want to be diapered,
spanked, and breastfed,

208
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:46,625
then strut away
like they conquered an army.

209
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:48,708
Nurture his weakness.

210
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,208
Be his strength,

211
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,625
and he'll worship you.

212
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,125
I... don't know if I can.

213
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:00,500
Stop running to and from men,

214
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,541
and decide what you want
for your fucking self.

215
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,458
I want to be in control of my life.

216
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,916
Then take control of his,

217
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,833
Princess.

218
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,375
Poor thing.

219
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,458
That white man is going to kill her
with the rest of them.

220
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,916
I will not be a burden to you long.

221
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,583
You had a place here once.

222
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,375
I have no place until I've had my revenge.

223
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,791
For that, I need my sword.

224
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,416
Can you fit them back together?

225
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:53,916
No.

226
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,000
Broken is broken.

227
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,583
Then it must be remelted and reforged.

228
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,833
Your sword broke
because the blend was wrong.

229
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,750
It was perfect.

230
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,250
It was too pure.

231
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,000
Your metal
wants to be blended with new steel.

232
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,208
Do you have steel for me?

233
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,291
No.

234
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,250
Then give me a sword.

235
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,750
No.

236
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:21,625
The fire in you rages beyond control.

237
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,833
I'm not the child you once knew.

238
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,458
No.

239
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,583
That child would see you and run.

240
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:35,500
That child understood
the meaning of a sword,

241
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,166
the line separating life and death.

242
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,708
I have no steel for you.

243
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,666
Then I will make my own.

244
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:23,083
<i>Mizu!</i>

245
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,375
How'd you know I was here?

246
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,750
Your tools you use in place of hands,

247
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,458
who made them?

248
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:26,791
Huh. Mm...

249
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,208
I did.

250
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,583
Why?

251
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
To be useful.

252
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,375
Is that all?

253
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,708
I want to be a samurai.
I want to be great.

254
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,833
Hmm.

255
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,666
Most people laugh when I tell them that.

256
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,708
Is it funny?

257
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,041
Samurai needs hands.

258
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:56,958
Do they?

259
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,125
As a swordmaker needs eyes?

260
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,208
Your hands.

261
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,166
An accident, or by birth?

262
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:08,833
Birth.

263
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:10,958
Your eyes?

264
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,833
A fire.

265
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:17,958
And now, fire listens to you.

266
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,333
Hmm.

267
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,875
You worked all night.
Thought you might be hungry.

268
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,000
Old man Itagaki's famous fish dumplings.

269
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,416
Only good thing about Kohama.

270
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,416
I've never tried them before.

271
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,166
Remember?
I was just a dog who ate gutter scraps.

272
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:34,833
Your blade.

273
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,250
The steel wouldn't form for me.

274
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,750
So what?

275
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,083
You have to go after

276
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,416
that son-of-a-bitch Fowler
before it's too late.

277
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,291
"The sword is the soul of the samurai."

278
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:48,708
No, that's just what they tell
first-year students in the dojo.

279
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,416
You're good. Maybe better than me.

280
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:55,208
And no one is better than me.

281
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:58,541
Look, the weapon doesn't matter.

282
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,375
You could beat him with a hammer.

283
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:04,166
Here. Get up.

284
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,833
Master Eiji won't like you moving things.

285
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,458
Ha-ha!

286
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,958
Ah, I'm in way too much pain to spar.

287
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,250
You think you can take me down twice?

288
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,250
Uh. Oh. Uh... I... I... I'm... I'm...

289
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:45,916
I'm sorry.

290
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:51,666
Don't be sorry, Taigen.

291
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,708
Taigen?

292
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,333
Must be missing Akemi.

293
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,958
There's something I need to tell you.

294
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:14,000
You'll never see Akemi again.

295
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:15,000
What?

296
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,500
She's in Edo, marrying Takayoshi Itoh.

297
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,666
How do you know this?

298
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,541
I stood by
as the Tokunobu guards took her away.

299
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:25,416
She came looking for me
to save your engagement.

300
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,333
And you just let them take her?

301
00:23:27,416 --> 00:23:29,208
It was for her own good.

302
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:32,083
I have to go to Edo.

303
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:35,833
No. It's too dangerous.
Fowler's plotting an attack on Edo Castle.

304
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:36,750
What?

305
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:40,583
I saw his plans.
He has an army armed with foreign rifles.

306
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,125
He's smart. He'll move to strike
during the Council of Elders.

307
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:45,291
You've known all this time.

308
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,416
The shogun is in danger.
Akemi is in danger.

309
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,625
What kind of samurai are you?

310
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,041
I'm going to kill Fowler.

311
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,250
Not for honor.

312
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:56,833
For hate.

313
00:23:57,291 --> 00:23:58,791
You really are a demon.

314
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:07,833
I'm going to Edo to warn the shogun,

315
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:10,958
and then I'm going
to find you and kill you.

316
00:24:21,541 --> 00:24:24,000
The greatest gift
I ever received

317
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:27,916
was from Lady Itoh, who gave me two sons.

318
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,916
So that should I die,

319
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,625
it would be
of no consequence to the nation,

320
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:35,750
save the trouble
of a few prayers.

321
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:42,500
It is with pleasure I offer a seat
to celebrate the union of my second son,

322
00:24:42,583 --> 00:24:44,166
Takayoshi Itoh,

323
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,708
to the only daughter
of Lord Daichi Tokunobu.

324
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:54,208
Each of you is here for your proven
devotion to the shogunate.

325
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:58,083
May the bride
be as loyal as your clans are to me.

326
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,458
May her womb
be as fruitful as your fields.

327
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,750
Mmm. Oh...

328
00:25:14,166 --> 00:25:15,166
My dear,

329
00:25:15,625 --> 00:25:19,375
your meal was prepared especially for you.

330
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:30,000
Rabbit liver in a velouté of horse semen.

331
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,291
For fertility.

332
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,666
I do hope you can handle your duties

333
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:35,916
as an Itoh wife.

334
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,166
You'll find I can handle anything.

335
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:46,041
Mmm.

336
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,083
Chilled fox brain for wisdom.

337
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,666
A pottage from fetal pig's blood.

338
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,916
For youth and vitality.

339
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,708
This one was your husband's idea.

340
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,875
Such a sweet boy.

341
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,083
So... everything crumbled.

342
00:26:53,791 --> 00:26:54,916
Your steel.

343
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:58,166
Perhaps a demon cannot make steel.

344
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:00,458
Is that so?

345
00:27:02,458 --> 00:27:05,083
The world sees me
and sees a hateful monster.

346
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:06,666
An <i>onryō.</i>

347
00:27:07,166 --> 00:27:08,708
My own mother saw it too...

348
00:27:09,666 --> 00:27:11,000
and could not love me.

349
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,291
Maybe they're right.

350
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:16,666
I did not train you to be a demon

351
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,250
or a human.

352
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,375
I showed you how to be an artist.

353
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:25,041
To be an artist is to do one thing only.

354
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:28,916
Look at me.

355
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:32,791
Cannot fight, or weave, or farm.

356
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:34,708
I make swords.

357
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:38,166
I cook for strength to make good swords.

358
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:43,458
I study the sutras
to cleanse my heart to make good swords.

359
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:46,083
You think revenge is an art?

360
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,000
Swords, pots, noodles, death.

361
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,958
It is all the same to an artist.

362
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:55,666
Then I'm a bad artist.

363
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:01,375
An artist gives all they have to the art,

364
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:02,458
the whole.

365
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,791
Your strengths and deficiencies,

366
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:10,125
your loves and shames.

367
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,333
Perhaps the people you collected.

368
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,791
I made my best blades
when I had an apprentice.

369
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,125
I thought I annoyed you.

370
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:23,791
Both are true.

371
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:29,750
There may be a demon in you,
but there is more.

372
00:28:30,916 --> 00:28:32,916
If you do not invite the whole,

373
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,458
the demon takes two chairs,

374
00:28:35,958 --> 00:28:37,958
and your art will suffer.

375
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,125
Then what do I do?

376
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,583
I only know how to make swords.

377
00:28:44,166 --> 00:28:46,500
Each morning, I start a fire.

378
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,791
And begin again.

379
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:30,666
Like tofu ready to be devoured.

380
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,458
Master Takayoshi sent you a gift.

381
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:36,583
Since you enjoyed
your dinner so much,

382
00:29:36,666 --> 00:29:38,750
he provided you breakfast and lunch.

383
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:55,375
Is it funny to torment me?
Kill my bird and make me eat it?

384
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,750
Give me two more?

385
00:29:59,458 --> 00:30:00,666
Say something.

386
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,791
Or is it beneath you to speak to me?

387
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:08,458
It was an... a... apology

388
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,750
f... for my mother.

389
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:31,166
I see.

390
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,291
Your gift was sincere.

391
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:37,625
Can my husband forgive me
for striking him?

392
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,791
My husband has no cause
for shame with his wife

393
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:49,500
nor need he ever rush his reply.

394
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:53,083
The most brilliant tutor
I ever had had a stammer.

395
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,666
Lesser teachers laughed,

396
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:58,375
but I knew it was because
his mind was so full of thoughts

397
00:30:58,458 --> 00:31:00,250
his mouth simply couldn't keep up.

398
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,250
When he recited poetry,

399
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:07,125
the words filled with meaning
and filled me with fire.

400
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:10,750
I... always had a devastating crush on him.

401
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:13,666
Again,

402
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,666
can my husband forgive me
for striking him?

403
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,000
Mm... Yes.

404
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:24,291
Would my husband recite for me?

405
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:55,958
Ringo.

406
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,250
You know the Heart Sutra?

407
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:08,541
"The body is emptiness,
and emptiness body."

408
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,958
"All things are only empty."

409
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,250
- "Nothing is born, nothing broken..."
- "Nothing is born, nothing broken..."

410
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:29,500
There are some things I cannot do alone.

411
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,708
I want to hear you.

412
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:04,625
Go on.

413
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:11,750
"If only for t... t... tonight."

414
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,958
"Let us share this pillow."

415
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,166
"For I have long traveled

416
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:26,541
on the pathway of my dreams
to find reality."

417
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:49,875
<i>Searched every boat
and every cart on every coast.</i>

418
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,875
<i>And found nothing.</i>

419
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,125
<i>There are no Western guns in Japan.</i>

420
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:58,166
<i>I fear your white man is a fraud,</i>

421
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,166
<i>and you are on your way to your death.</i>

422
00:35:02,916 --> 00:35:04,333
Hmm. A letter?

423
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,291
Just business.

424
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:10,041
Finish your business.
I have something to show you.

425
00:35:10,916 --> 00:35:13,083
A shiny new toy.

426
00:35:15,541 --> 00:35:18,000
I asked for two condemned men.

427
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,125
They sent four.

428
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,291
It's nice to be respected.

429
00:35:31,291 --> 00:35:32,500
Go on then!

430
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,833
Do your worst.

431
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:46,500
My turn.

432
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:49,791
Time to test our guns.

433
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:51,875
Our guns?

434
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:55,250
I don't understand. Where are they?

435
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,166
They're right here.

436
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,250
Of course, I had to modify the designs

437
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:06,291
to get 2,000 rifles
from my country into yours without notice.

438
00:36:06,875 --> 00:36:10,166
My country's history is one
of manufactured suffering.

439
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,250
I was a boy when the Tudors

440
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:16,083
burned any food the rebels
under O'Neill might think to eat.

441
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,041
We starved. Everyone starved.

442
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:21,666
Mouths on the dead
stained green from chewing nettles.

443
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,500
You get resourceful in a famine.

444
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:25,666
My parents died early.

445
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,875
Left me and my sister catching rats.

446
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:33,791
The rats ran out quick.
Fed my sister on my blood.

447
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:36,500
It kept her alive an extra two weeks.

448
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:38,708
I didn't sleep for three days

449
00:36:38,791 --> 00:36:42,833
to protect her body from the starving
till the ground thawed.

450
00:36:43,541 --> 00:36:46,458
I cut out her kidneys and buried her.

451
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:49,166
Fat cap on them like a pea.

452
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:55,083
I haven't eaten a single meal
since my mind didn't go to that bite.

453
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:59,166
It was the last thing I ever did
because I had to.

454
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,583
I control my life now.

455
00:37:05,291 --> 00:37:06,291
Every bite.

456
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,875
Master Chiba tried
to steal my delivery.

457
00:37:34,958 --> 00:37:38,083
I think he had a mind
to lead our coup without us.

458
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,416
You want his thumbs?

459
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,708
What about his soldiers?

460
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,291
They're your soldiers now.

461
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:51,750
Seems we lost our man on the inside.

462
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:55,083
Seems you'll have to do
Chiba's job in the castle.

463
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,291
Think you can manage?

464
00:38:18,083 --> 00:38:21,500
A sword from this steel could kill a god.

465
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:26,666
You will make a blade from this
worthy of your purpose.

466
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,125
No. You're right.

467
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,583
I don't deserve a sword. Not yet.

468
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,625
This steel is for you.

469
00:38:37,166 --> 00:38:39,916
I must go to Edo
and kill the man I am sworn to kill.

470
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,666
If I succeed and am still alive,
I will return.

471
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,833
And you can determine
if I am worthy of a sword of this metal

472
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,458
made by your hand.

473
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,458
Forgive me
for leaving, Master Eiji.

474
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:00,916
I know you were excited to be my teacher,
maybe for years.

475
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:03,125
But Master needs me.

476
00:39:10,458 --> 00:39:11,875
Goodbye, Swordfather.

477
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,666
Bye, Swordfather!

478
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:25,750
Hmm.

479
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:42,750
Take your belongings.
Your services are no longer required.

480
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:46,416
Tell Lady Itoh
she can stop curating my meals

481
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,583
and my company.

482
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,083
But who will attend to you?

483
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:59,250
The princess summoned us.

484
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,166
This isn't a summons.

485
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:05,166
It's a business proposition, Madame Kaji.

486
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,166
I now have money of my own

487
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,458
and would like
to buy out your ladies' contracts.

488
00:40:10,291 --> 00:40:11,291
All of them.

489
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:15,375
Five times what each owes you.

490
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,625
On what terms?

491
00:40:17,708 --> 00:40:18,833
No terms

492
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,708
other than that each woman
considers herself free and free to go.

493
00:40:24,958 --> 00:40:26,791
I don't have to become a prostitute?

494
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:29,375
You don't owe us.

495
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:30,458
I don't.

496
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,666
But it seems I've decided
what I want for my fucking self.

497
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:37,041
Also, I find myself
in need of new attendants.

498
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:40,833
Good pay, new clothes.
You'd have to live here though.

499
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:45,958
Here? In your palace?

500
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:49,791
There is opportunity here.
But I have much to learn.

501
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:51,791
I need friends I can trust.

502
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,041
Friends experienced in the world.

503
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,833
This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

504
00:41:07,416 --> 00:41:09,916
Oh my gosh. I cannot believe this.

505
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,041
I meant it. If you don't want to stay...

506
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,375
I was awful to you,

507
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:21,875
and you offer me this?

508
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:27,333
Please. Akemi, please listen to me.

509
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,750
You have to leave.

510
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:31,166
You're in terrible danger here.

511
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:37,125
Father, I didn't know what to do
but to come to you.

512
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:39,791
Tell him what you told me. Go on.

513
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,708
There's a plot against the shogunate.

514
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:46,666
A white man is planning
to attack Edo Castle

515
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,250
and kill Shogun Itoh and his whole family.

516
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,375
Everyone inside the castle walls.

517
00:41:51,458 --> 00:41:54,416
He has an army, foreign guns,

518
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,208
accomplices within the court.

519
00:41:58,041 --> 00:41:59,166
Did he say when?

520
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:01,208
The lords' assembly.

521
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,291
You have to leave now.

522
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,041
Thank you.

523
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,708
You may have saved us all,

524
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:10,625
including my daughter.

525
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:12,916
Who else knows this?

526
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,500
No one.

527
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,500
I cannot thank you enough.

528
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:27,625
Ise.

529
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,916
I told you to trust me.

530
00:42:32,791 --> 00:42:36,000
You won't be married
to some horrible man for long.

531
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,250
You're a member of the Itoh Clan now.

532
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:51,583
The people will rally around you
when the shogun and his sons are gone,

533
00:42:52,958 --> 00:42:54,833
allowing their power to fall to me...

534
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:59,208
...shared with my new partners.

535
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:01,375
Many will die.

536
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:06,500
You'll be safe here till it's over.

537
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,416
Then... you can thank me.

538
00:43:13,583 --> 00:43:14,750
No!
