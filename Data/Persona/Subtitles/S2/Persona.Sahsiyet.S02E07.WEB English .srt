1
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:19,640
Once upon a time, I was afraid that I would forget everything.

2
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:23,440
What I experienced, what I did,

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,440
...I was devastated with fear that I would forget what kind of person I was.

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,480
But now I remember it all.

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,840
What I experienced, what I did,

6
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,439
...what kind of person was I? I know it all now.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,719
The strange thing is…

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,679
I'm even more afraid now.

9
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,759
Oh, my body hurts everywhere.

10
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,479
Good morning!

11
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,039
Oh, Ertan, what happened to us? We went to sleep so early last night that we stayed up.

12
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,400
Well, it's good, my dear.

13
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,080
Me too, I'm tired of running here and there,

14
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,039
...we got some rest, okay?

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,319
I'm a bit dizzy too.

16
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,879
It's like this, I took sleeping pills and lots of them...

17
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,360
Now get up, wash your hands and face, and I'll prepare breakfast.

18
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,919
Okay, let me take care of my father's medicine first, then.

19
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,400
No, don't worry, your father is not at home.

20
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,240
How come?

21
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:16,520
The man has been saying since yesterday that he should go for a walk or something.

22
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,400
He probably went for a walk.

23
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:21,120
Well, I guess Ertan, a human being...

24
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,120
...won't he call and ask, for God's sake!

25
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,919
Oh, this is Kambura my love, it's a tiny place!

26
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,800
It's a place your father knows, so what will happen!

27
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,520
Where is this phone of mine? Where is this phone of mine? Heh!

28
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,000
- Oh my God, Ertan. -Okay okay.

29
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,199
Look, there is no Deva either.

30
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,000
Apparently he also went to Fatoş.

31
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,719
- Oh, let it go. - So this issue has also been resolved.

32
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,520
So okay, you can relax, everything is taken care of. Is it ok?

33
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,000
- Oh, where did I put it? - Something to wonder about, my dear!

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,719
Well, let's take care of each other a little. We were left alone.

35
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,319
At the end of forty years.

36
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,039
Deva!

37
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:08,719
Deva!

38
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,639
Deva!

39
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,079
- Destiny! - Don't shout, don't shout,

40
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,920
- ...I will take you to Destiny. - Where is Deva?

41
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,360
- You didn't do anything to my grandchild, did you? - Good good…

42
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,360
- You'll see for yourself now. - Well, okay, where is it, let's go.

43
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,600
- Wait a minute, wait. - Stop what?

44
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,040
- Let's see, are you full or empty? - Oh, I'm full, of course I'm full.

45
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,040
I'm full, can't I be full, I'm full to the brim, I'm fed up.

46
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,199
- Raise your arms up. - Yes, that's what you're saying, no, I'll get moody.

47
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,120
- Oh, wait! - I get moody.

48
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:50,920
- Lift, lift. - Your temper....

49
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,279
Aaa!

50
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,240
Aaa!

51
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,600
What more could there be!

52
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,000
What do I do? You kidnapped my grandchild!

53
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,560
Should I come with a broken-ass gun? I swear, if I found it, I would come with a tank.

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,160
Oh, I always wanted to have one of these, too.

55
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,519
Wow, that was great, heh!

56
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,920
My luck is today.

57
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,000
- Is there anything else? - Nothing else, anything else.

58
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,279
Ya, al, al, al hadi al, al! Al, bunu da al... Al!

59
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,920
Another?

60
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,720
Nothing.

61
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,199
Al, al hadi, bir de bu var al!

62
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,199
Take it, take it, you carry it anyway, like a dead donkey, they all take it, you carry it.

63
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,319
Do you know who painted this picture?

64
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,480
I don't know, how should I know?

65
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,920
Damn, it would happen to me that...

66
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,920
…I was going to cut off your ears!

67
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,920
They destroyed my dear wall! Look at this! Like the devil!

68
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,000
Is this really you, heh? Destiny says so.

69
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,920
No, you are in no mood to be evil!

70
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,279
Of course not, what did you think!

71
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,360
Go, go, go.

72
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,000
-Oh, I want to talk to you about something, Zuhal. - Huh!

73
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,720
Opening! Don't open, don't open!

74
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,720
Opening.

75
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,680
Oh, maybe it's my father.

76
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,959
Heh, he's here.

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,040
Who is calling?

78
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,720
There's Sajan, he's calling.

79
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,240
I'm tired of this guy!

80
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,560
He gave us a drug and took over our lives, man!

81
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,879
Is there a call in the morning and evening, does such a thing happen?

82
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,480
Saturn! Opening.

83
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,680
Opening.

84
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:47,839
Zuhal, hang up that phone.

85
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,800
Quarter

86
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,000
Quarter

87
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,040
What are you doing!

88
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,680
What are you doing, are you crazy, why are you screaming?

89
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,360
Is there something between you and this guy?

90
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,360
Whatever you say, it doesn't matter.

91
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,560
Then why is this guy trying like a maniac with you?

92
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
I told you this, Ertan.

93
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,399
This man read my book and was very impressed.

94
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,519
"You saved my life," this man says to me. What more can you say?

95
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:24,759
That's why he helps us.

96
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,720
Your book doesn't save lives, my dear.

97
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:30,160
Those ridiculous "get back to life" talk,

98
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,919
...doesn't do shit in real life! Let him know.

99
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,639
Don't fool yourself!

100
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,320
You wrote something, and I embellished it...

101
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,960
...I packaged it and sold it. That's it.

102
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,799
You say these just to upset me!

103
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,000
No, I'm telling the truth!

104
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:52,919
Especially if you cheated on me with this guy...

105
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,759
With this guy too?

106
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,840
I remember, I remember everything.

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,159
Who did I kill, why did I kill...

108
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
...every time I killed, I remember them all.

109
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,799
Leave Deva, do whatever you want to do to me.

110
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,279
So now you remember everything.

111
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,559
Tell me!

112
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,879
Why did you kill my brother?

113
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,399
One evening, we were out with a lady friend...

114
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,000
- Shut up! Go ahead. - Who are they, Agah?

115
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,840
-What are you doing, isn't it shameful? - Get out, uncle.

116
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,159
- Come on uncle, come out. - Agah

117
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,200
- Come on uncle, come on uncle. Come on! - What the hell is going on?

118
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,440
Aaa!.. A****** the damn clown..

119
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,759
You now...

120
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,960
...did you kill my brother for this?

121
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,720
Because they were rude to you.

122
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,240
So, did our boy pull a gun on you?

123
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,039
- No! - Heh!

124
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,600
So there is no self-defense.

125
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,279
Just because they pushed you around a lady.

126
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,399
You couldn't resist! You said, "Can this be done to me?"

127
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,320
...you pulled the gun and shot them all.

128
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,200
Well, won't you give up, Ertan?

129
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,200
Aren't you tired? How many years passed? When will this end?

130
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,320
Ok. I cheated.

131
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,519
When I came here, I met a man, and after that...

132
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,559
Don't tell, I don't want to tell, don't tell!

133
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:56,879
Okay, so why, constantly, endlessly...

134
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,720
...are you implying this to me?

135
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,960
Ertan, if you couldn't forget me, why didn't you leave me?

136
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,639
I know why. You want me to be indebted to you.

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,600
Look at me while drinking! Hop! A debt immediately.

138
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,360
Then I came here, I made a mistake, okay.

139
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,639
You did great, thank you. Oh, there's a debt there too.

140
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,519
You have never forgiven me, Ertan.

141
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
You always calculated debt, debt.

142
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,759
Look, I swear to you, Ertan, you are a loan shark.

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,399
What you are doing is called emotional usury!

144
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,240
Beautiful.

145
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,600
You came up with a very nice saying,

146
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,320
...you can write about this in your other book too!

147
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,399
No, it's just like that.

148
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,759
Whatever you gave, you are now getting back with interest!

149
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,519
- Do you know what I was going to tell you just now? - Oh, what were you going to say, Ertan?

150
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,559
I was going to say let's take your father to Australia.

151
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,399
Let him live with us, let him stay with us,

152
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,799
...I was going to say let's be together.

153
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,480
God! God!

154
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,159
You didn't want it at all?

155
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,080
You know, even if you died, you wouldn't live in the same house with Agah Beyoğlu, you Ertan!

156
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,360
Yes, I still think so, I still say so.

157
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,679
- Huh! - But just for you,

158
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,440
...I just thought it would be like that for you.

159
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,360
Oh! So you were going to write me another debt, right Ertan?

160
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,799
Heh! You were going to write me another debt.

161
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,200
You actually owe me.

162
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,080
You owe me money, why should I tell you?

163
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,559
Because you have failed every job you have ever undertaken.

164
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,679
Then you see, aah!

165
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,399
Zuhal does something that makes money like this.

166
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,879
...that's why you didn't leave me.

167
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,639
You stayed with me for money, Ertan!

168
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,600
You stayed for the money!

169
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,120
Are others like that too?

170
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,000
Kim?

171
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,120
Did they also misbehave with you? Is that why you shot all those men?

172
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
There is a district called Kambura.

173
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,759
Years ago,

174
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,120
...fifty men there, (breath)

175
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,559
…raped a little girl.

176
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,360
And none of them were prosecuted.

177
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,799
So I went after these.

178
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,240
I killed what I caught.

179
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,759
Wow Wow wow.

180
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,200
So you have dispensed justice.

181
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,279
(Nida) I did what was necessary.

182
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,120
Jacob!

183
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,080
We knew this guy, the leading maniac,

184
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:11,200
Turns out he was a hero!

185
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,759
Agah Effendi, are you a hero?

186
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,080
- No I'm not! - What are you then?

187
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:20,519
I don't know!

188
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,759
Agah sir look!

189
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,679
Either you use this weapon, or this weapon uses you.

190
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,879
You have become a prisoner of this weapon!

191
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:41,519
You thought killing was a game!

192
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,840
Inside it is my brother, struggling on the ground,

193
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,360
...you burst out laughing. You laugh.

194
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,039
There is this place. This place does not forget!

195
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
He knows exactly what the hell he's doing.

196
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm sorry, Destiny.

197
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,159
Don't apologize to me.

198
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,080
Apologize to Deva.

199
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,759
(breath)

200
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,279
Saturn!

201
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,720
I am going.

202
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:50,480
To where?

203
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,759
I think it's over now.

204
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,960
Let's not hurt or upset each other anymore.

205
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,200
I want to leave.

206
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,679
Hah, here we go again! Which one is this?

207
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,519
No, I'm very serious this time.

208
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,159
Ah, you were very serious then too. You told me you want to leave,

209
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,759
...then we got up and came here and we were miserable with Deva.

210
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,000
Just wait, you too!

211
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,799
Ertan!

212
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,720
This time, I want to leave.

213
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,039
Is it ok? This time, I want to leave; Because...

214
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,759
...because you said this many times and couldn't manage it...

215
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,840
Let me handle this this time!

216
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,679
I mean, let's go, everyone, go ahead!

217
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,759
Well, all right!

218
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,080
Then you talk to Deva.

219
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,960
Why am I talking? You talk to Deva.

220
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:49,600
Call your son,

221
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,320
...say son, like this, we are leaving with your mother.

222
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,240
But be sure to tell us why we broke up. He asks because he is a child.

223
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,000
You know, you were taking care of everything.

224
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,919
You will talk to Deva.

225
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:05,559
You will talk to Deva, Ertan.

226
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,160
Because you've been running away from everything your whole life.

227
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
This time you will talk to Deva.

228
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,759
Call the child and tell him.

229
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,319
Deva da zaten...

230
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,920
...he has more trouble than he can handle, my child.

231
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,720
He is just trying to make amends with Fatoş.

232
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,759
And he will feel sorry for us!

233
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,119
Ertan!

234
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:30,160
You're not going anywhere without talking to Deva.

235
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,400
(breath-exclamation)

236
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,559
Remedy! Cure my son! Deva, let go, I'll take you out.

237
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,599
Destiny! Destiny, let the child go.

238
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,559
- Let the child go, you... - Shh... Wait a minute!

239
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,920
...then do whatever you want with me. Leave!

240
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,240
- Master Agah! - What?

241
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:56,079
That job is not that easy.

242
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,640
Since you are healed, you remember everything. It will be worse.

243
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,599
- Well, Hikmet told you! - What? What did he say?

244
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,279
Well, he told you.

245
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,079
Just because fate won't take you out of mourning.

246
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,359
Oh, Destiny, don't do it, Destiny.

247
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,400
Do you understand now? What kind of a trap are you in?

248
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,400
But this upset us at Hikmet.

249
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,359
He said he would handle it, but he couldn't.

250
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,119
Turns out he cheated us.

251
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,799
Of course, when I learned this...

252
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:37,000
...I wondered who I should take out the pain of this stake on.

253
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,480
From you!

254
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,720
Destiny, don't do it, let me love your eyes, don't do it, okay.

255
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,640
I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I am sorry.

256
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,000
- Oh, shut up. - I'm sorry, let the child go.

257
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,200
Your problem is with me. Will you kill me then, what will he do?

258
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,359
... do whatever you want, just leave the child.

259
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,759
Deva!

260
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,279
My son!

261
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,839
Now I'm going to ask you a question, see if you can figure it out.

262
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,640
Destiny, Destiny, let the child go.

263
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,039
- How do you get a snake out of its hole? - Stop, stop, Destiny.

264
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,440
Don't do it, fate! Destiny!

265
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,880
Don't make it fate,

266
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,000
- ...let me love your eyes, don't do it, don't do it. - You'll say it sweetly, right? Huh?

267
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,599
- Hey! But wrong. - Let the child go.

268
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,839
Do you know what the truth is?

269
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,160
To pull a snake out of its hole,

270
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,839
- ...you will kill your wife first. - Huh! Huh!

271
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,079
Here you are too

272
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:35,279
- ...you came out of your hole and came here. - Don't do it, Destiny! Destiny!

273
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:35,920
Don't do it, fate!

274
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,880
- Don't let me care for your eyes, let the child go. - Wait man, stop!

275
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,400
Let the child go.

276
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,079
Your brother Hikmet could not handle this.

277
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,720
Don't act like fate!

278
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,000
But I do this

279
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,720
- ...I stabbed his wife in the throat. - Huh! Huh!

280
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,680
(breath-exclamation)

281
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,680
Ahh!

282
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,160
Ahhh!

283
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,839
Deva! Deva!

284
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,039
Remedy! Remedy! My son. Deva, my son. Remedy.

285
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:13,680
Remedy! Remedy! Deva open your eyes.

286
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,319
Open your eyes, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me, forgive me.

287
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,000
Deva! Deva!

288
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,640
Wake up my son, wake up my child, wake up my grandfather,

289
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,400
...wake up my dear, wake up my son, wake up.

290
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,319
Remedy! Remedy! Help! Help!

291
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,960
Deva! Deva! Deva!

292
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,039
My son!

293
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,839
Is there anyone? Remedy!

294
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,160
Mr. Agah! Here, sign this.

295
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,640
It's called Dog Killer.

296
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:12,920
Farm...

297
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,200
Donkeys...

298
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:18,400
Jacob...

299
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,799
Interesting…

300
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,880
Kader?

301
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:28,640
The famous Destiny is also involved, huh?

302
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:29,839
God! God!

303
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,559
Do you remember me?

304
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,960
I said, "You have Alzheimer's?" and he forgot me.

305
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,599
I did not forget.

306
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,799
You didn't forget but…

307
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,319
You have seen dreams again, Mr. Agah.

308
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,039
The man you call destiny is already dead and gone.

309
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,680
He neither dies nor dies, he is simply alive.

310
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,640
He made us all miserable, he did everything.

311
00:22:56,599 --> 00:22:58,119
You got it mixed up, Mr. Agah!

312
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,960
Dog Killer shot both your grandson and his wife.

313
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,039
You forgot to mention that.

314
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,119
Yakup shot Deva.

315
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,599
Destiny also killed Fatoş! He confessed it himself!

316
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,079
This guy is taking revenge.

317
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,960
I told you that I killed so many people,

318
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,400
...you didn't believe me,

319
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,319
... I killed his brother,

320
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,240
- ...that's why he's after my family. - Wait a minute, wait a minute…

321
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,759
Are you the one who killed the dog? Are you telling me that?

322
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,480
No, then, we'll let you in right away.

323
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:38,079
Go in and go to jail. You will die inside.

324
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,880
But you say Destiny is alive,

325
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:44,839
On top of that, he wants to take revenge on you.

326
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,839
Well, to your daughter and son-in-law,

327
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,319
...what will happen next, I don't know.

328
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,759
You are also one of them.

329
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,160
You also work with Kader!

330
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,319
Look! It's all because of Alzheimer's.

331
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:09,519
I told you. Destiny is dead and gone.

332
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,240
Just tell me this.

333
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,000
Are you the Dog Killer?

334
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,400
Think carefully, Mr. Agah, think carefully and answer accordingly.

335
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,720
I can't believe it! I cant believe.

336
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:34,319
What does this want from us? No, what have we done to this?

337
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:39,480
My dear Zuhal! Come sit down my dear. Sit down for a while.

338
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,599
Oh, Ertan, look, this Dog Killer...

339
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,200
What did the despicable creature called ... want from my son?

340
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,359
First, first he pulled a gun on me,

341
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,599
...father was not enough, now he wants to kill my son.

342
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,240
No, what did we do to this woman called Nevra?

343
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,279
...what does he want from us, what is his problem with us?

344
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:56,880
He shot at me too, I wish he had shot me,

345
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,000
- I wish he had shot me. - Dad, I'm so sorry.

346
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,039
...I'm sorry, I got into Deva's trouble,

347
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,720
...I forgot you, who knows how scared you were!

348
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:05,359
I was scared, I was scared yes.

349
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:06,839
(breath)

350
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,440
Now there is something I don't understand, dad.

351
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,400
So Deva wasn't going to meet Fatoş?

352
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,079
- Yes! - Let me call him!

353
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,680
Also, this girl's phone is always off.

354
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,359
It was as if the ground opened up and this girl entered it.

355
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,319
It was so. Unfortunately, that's what happened.

356
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:23,519
You were telling something, dad, tell me.

357
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,079
- What? - You were telling something.

358
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,599
Well, now...

359
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,799
Deva!

360
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,440
It woke me up in the morning.

361
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
- Dad! - He said take me to Istanbul, heh?

362
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,920
- Didn't you say that he left the evening? - No.

363
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,680
Oh my God! Allah! I remember like,

364
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,079
...as if we were sleeping, you came...

365
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,319
...you woke me up like this, you asked me where Deva is,

366
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:43,680
- True, true, true. - Did I dream?

367
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,640
No no. You, you remember correctly.

368
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,400
Me too, I thought so too, I thought it was in Istanbul too.

369
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
It turns out that the boy didn't go, he went for a walk.

370
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:52,160
Morning came.

371
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,480
He took me, anyway, I took this, we were on the road, I was stuck.

372
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,599
I said let me do it here, somewhere to the side, I stopped.

373
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,519
It turns out that Deva also got out of the car.

374
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,279
I saw this Dog Killer coming towards us, shooting.

375
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,240
He shot the child.

376
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,720
So, dad, did he leave you like that, did he just leave?

377
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:15,680
Oh, there was a car, he jumped in the car and left.

378
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:20,160
Oh, I can't understand this, dad, this woman, this person, this one,

379
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:23,119
...how did he find you on the intercity road, how did he manage to do this?

380
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,880
- Weren't you with him? - He, he, he, the police, the police told me about that.

381
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,599
The police here at the hospital told me.

382
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,519
He said to you, they put a tracking device.

383
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:31,920
I said, what is that?

384
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:34,640
He said, look, he took out something like this, as if he had put it with his hand,

385
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,960
...such a black box.

386
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,319
I said, what is this?

387
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:39,519
From the military or what? What military said?

388
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:42,200
...they sell it for three cents at the electricians' bazaar.

389
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:43,920
Something like that.

390
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,160
So where is this tool?

391
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,759
- Where should I look, where is the tool? - Heh, heh? They took it, they took the tool.

392
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,160
- Who took? - The police took it.

393
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,599
Well, I guess it will burn something that will be fingerprinted, I don't know.

394
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,480
Aah!

395
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,160
Is there any progress?

396
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,880
Calm, calm, please.

397
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,920
- We did everything we could. - Yes.

398
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,440
He lost a lot of blood.

399
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,599
For now, all values ​​are stable.

400
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,559
Oh, thank God!

401
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,559
- But unfortunately he is in a coma. - Huh!

402
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,440
Of course, it is not possible to say how long this situation will last.

403
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:15,880
But don't worry, we do it with all our means,

404
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,559
...we will do everything we can.

405
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,440
- Ah! My aunt came. - What?

406
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,640
How did he know?

407
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,720
Apparently this Dog Killer is after us, girl.

408
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:53,960
We can't go home anymore. He knows the exact address.

409
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,079
We will stay at your aunt's. This is the best.

410
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,440
But you always fight, dad?

411
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,240
You leave me now, how is Deva?

412
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:07,559
(nida)

413
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:09,680
Deva!

414
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:13,920
He's sleeping, my beautiful son.

415
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,160
You know, they say he's in a coma, but...

416
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,559
It looks like he's sleeping to me.

417
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,880
Oh, my baby. Oh my dear.

418
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,599
It'll be okay, Deva. It will be good…

419
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,759
- Hopefully! Hopefully! - Hopefully!

420
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:31,359
I'm so angry with you!

421
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:34,480
- Why? - Why didn't you call me earlier?

422
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:38,440
Why don't you say you came to your senses and got better?

423
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,400
Come on, these are kids!

424
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,279
- At least call! - Well, I called, there you go.

425
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,920
Hey, my aunt,

426
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,680
...now my father told you that we would come and stay with you, but...

427
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,559
...we won't disturb you at all.

428
00:28:52,279 --> 00:28:55,359
So don't be ridiculous! I wish I hadn't heard of it!

429
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:57,519
Agah told me everything.

430
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,880
(laugh) So let's ask, is it a cat or a dog?

431
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,119
...Is he a murderer, whatever the hell he is, come and see what I do to him.

432
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,799
(prayer is recited)

433
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,559
Everyone is gone.

434
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,960
- Was the funeral crowded? - I brought you halva, take it.

435
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
It was crowded.

436
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,880
But most of them came for gossip.

437
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,480
Why did he commit suicide, how did he commit suicide?

438
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:04,359
They always whispered about this. Just lie down for a while.

439
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,559
Oh, Melek, I'm sorry too, it came at such a wrong time.

440
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,519
Don't be ridiculous, of course you will come.

441
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,599
Was that half-witted Yakup going to take care of you?

442
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:16,880
- Heh, lie down. - Ahh, wait slow, ahh.

443
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,799
Ay, ay, should I put another pillow behind you?

444
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,880
Oh, no, no, thank you.

445
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,240
I knew it would be like this.

446
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,960
I knew one day he would do something to himself.

447
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,519
You know, now you're saying it.

448
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,119
You know, how did this wound happen, Melek, you say don't ask?

449
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,440
It was the same with Hikmet.

450
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,200
Without saying anything,

451
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,079
...he left without saying anything to anyone.

452
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,039
Ah! Ah!

453
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:58,720
What did you do, Yunus?

454
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:02,519
What did you do, how many years have passed,

455
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,400
Hikmet could never forget,

456
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,880
He went as far as taking his own life.

457
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,440
So, what did you do to make this happen?

458
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,720
Who did you hurt that made this situation come to this?

459
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,279
Whose curse did you take?

460
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,279
(breath) Come on.

461
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,279
Eat halvan.

462
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,240
(unintelligible speech)

463
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,799
(breath)

464
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,240
You know, all the cases should be gathered together,

465
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:30,440
...we were trying to file a lawsuit again for a while.

466
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,319
- What! what!

467
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,880
Thank you, the prosecutor at that time was very interested in our file.

468
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,119
Even...

469
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,160
...I went to everyone, but no one listened...

470
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:41,759
...only you accepted it. Thank you again for that.

471
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,680
What do you mean, our duty!

472
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,359
"I looked, I have a lot of documents, documents," he says.

473
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,000
He's obviously done a lot of research.

474
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,759
I said, bring it now, immediately!

475
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,720
I thought I'd check it out immediately.

476
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,200
What did he find? Is there any new information or finding?

477
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:56,640
Do you have something in your hand that we don't have?

478
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,720
I know, thank you.

479
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,200
Uh...

480
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,799
That's why we disturbed you.

481
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,160
Who's this?

482
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,279
Kader.

483
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:19,799
What are you saying?

484
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,920
Well, we know this man is dead?

485
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,400
Is his hometown known?

486
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,200
We don't know, but it's here, in Istanbul.

487
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,160
We even have a friend, Ulaş. He was following Destiny.

488
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,279
Then?

489
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,160
As far as we know, Destiny met this person.

490
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,880
His name is Yakup Sevindir. From Kader's team.

491
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:43,960
Then Ulaş disappeared.

492
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,240
Mary! Why didn't you let me know sooner?

493
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,359
Why are you trying to handle these things alone!

494
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,960
We are here!

495
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,039
Well, I will say the same thing again. I'm glad you came to me!

496
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:01,079
If it were anyone else, they wouldn't believe that these were Fate.

497
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,319
But I believe in you!

498
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,079
From where?

499
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,000
Because we are in this cause together!

500
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,199
In that case...

501
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,440
- We have an opening in two days. - What!

502
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,440
We are opening the monument to the missing 17s.

503
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,000
We are waiting for you too.

504
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,400
Besides, you give a speech. What would be nice.

505
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,880
Dear Mr. Fariz, I would love to…

506
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,920
...now if we appear there as prosecutors...

507
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:31,000
...we can't solve these issues here.

508
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,840
But you open it,

509
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,880
...I promise that I will come and visit you in a quiet time.

510
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,239
Definitely.

511
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,880
(cry)

512
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:48,360
That young Fatoş is dead and gone...

513
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,119
Deva is dying in a hospital room.

514
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,079
But this treacherous world continues to spin as if nothing happened.

515
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,559
I said, "If that's the case, I'll be back."

516
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,400
I will return to the past when I resigned.

517
00:37:05,719 --> 00:37:07,639
I will become a murderer again.

518
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:10,000
That's why I went to that lawyer.

519
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:13,360
So that he can tell me where Kader is so I can kill him.

520
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,119
Then I looked,

521
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:18,519
...it turns out that girl is in the same situation as me.

522
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,920
In short, we have come across such a coincidence with Meryem,

523
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,719
...if I tell it to someone now, they will say...

524
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,159
''Let Agah turn around, stop, the world is that small.''

525
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,519
And I tell him...

526
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,519
''The world is not small, crime is big''

527
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,880
I guess everyone here knows me.

528
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,719
But let me explain it in a few words.

529
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,960
These murderers had a list in their hands.

530
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,280
There were nineteen names on this list.

531
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,639
Nineteen people, nineteen people.

532
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:07,320
Of these nineteen people, they kidnapped sixteen.

533
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,320
They disappeared, they disappeared. There are three of us left.

534
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,440
Two of them passed away.

535
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,400
They died of their own causes.

536
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,760
In the end, I was the only one left alive.

537
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,000
Now...

538
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,559
...how did we save ourselves from the people who kidnapped and destroyed them...

539
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,039
...how did we escape from their hands?

540
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:37,239
We gave money to them.

541
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:42,159
We gave money to these murderers. And that's how we survived.

542
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,519
But believe me...

543
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,960
...we have been very ashamed of what we did throughout our lives.

544
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:50,639
We were always ashamed.

545
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,960
There are empty graves here.

546
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:57,599
And I'm still alive...

547
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,239
I am very ashamed of this.

548
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,519
Does a person feel ashamed every time he breathes?

549
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,119
I am ashamed.

550
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:13,239
Then I had a child,

551
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,199
...I was very ashamed of him too.

552
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,840
We love you very much, uncle Abidin.

553
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:28,480
The ones who should really be ashamed are those who killed those 17 lives!

554
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:36,400
Gel.

555
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,960
They told us to forget.

556
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,559
They said you will forget.

557
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,079
And they thought we would forget it without shame.

558
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,360
But every time they say forget it...

559
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,800
...we remembered more.

560
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,960
Now here, with this monument,

561
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:15,360
...not only us, but also others will remember.

562
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:18,239
Everyone will remember.

563
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,599
There are 17 empty graves here. 17 open wounds.

564
00:40:25,719 --> 00:40:28,760
And unless we are held accountable for our losses!

565
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,280
Unless the bones of these people are found.

566
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,920
Our wounds will never heal.

567
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,719
And these lands will always remain riddled with holes.

568
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,800
A person's relative disappears,

569
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,039
Three days pass and she waits for him to return.

570
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,000
Three years pass and she waits for him to call.

571
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,039
Thirty years pass,

572
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:12,559
...let me find your bones, he says!

573
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,800
That's what I say!

574
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,239
At least let me find my father's bones...

575
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:25,239
...don't let your bones ache anymore!

576
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,760
Everyone should know this very well!

577
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:31,440
We are here.

578
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:35,880
And whatever you do,

579
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:39,800
...we will never get lost!

580
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,119
Dilan Erdem!

581
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,079
We are here. Are you here too?

582
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,320
Here.

583
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,079
- Seyit Güven! - Here.

584
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:00,079
- Fahriye Güven! - Here.

585
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,320
- Remzi Yuksel! - Here.

586
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,119
- Victorious Lion! - Here.

587
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:09,679
- Saruhan Demiroğlu! - Here.

588
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,840
- Halil Karachay! - Here.

589
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:14,320
- Çetin Ertuk! - Here.

590
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
- Selime Özdemir. - Here.

591
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,559
- Mehmet İrfanoğlu. - Here.

592
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,679
- Fuat Erarslan! - Here.

593
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,960
- Kadir Dogan! - Here.

594
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:27,400
- Turgut Kefeci! - Here.

595
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,280
- İlhami Güral! - Here.

596
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,960
- Melih Derin! - Here.

597
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:38,000
- Süreyya Bozkaya! - Here.

598
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,159
- Tibetan Delusion! - Here.

599
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:46,000
At the core of all of these is the same darkness.

600
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:51,360
The missing, the unsolved, they all lead to the same darkness.

601
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,199
My son, Ateş Arbay...

602
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:02,400
...he no longer exists just because he was doing his duty, being a journalist. No.

603
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,159
(unintelligible speech)

604
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,679
We're looking for it, we're looking for it, it's nowhere to be found. Reach out!

605
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,400
What will I do, my child?

606
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:14,840
Give me some advice,

607
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:17,119
...where should I go, what should I do, who should I contact?

608
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:18,199
We will find it, auntie.

609
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,280
-...we will find it somehow! - Miss Meryem.

610
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,400
- Thank you, son. - Sorry. Miss Mary.

611
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:23,320
Mr. Agah!

612
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,679
But I told you, today is not a good day.

613
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,119
It's okay. I came anyway. I just want to ask you something.

614
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:31,360
Pardon.

615
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,119
Do you have the address of this Kader?

616
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:39,440
- Why, what will you do? - I will kill.

617
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,119
(breathing) Mr. Agah!

618
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,519
You obviously didn't understand what we were trying to do.

619
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:47,360
So don't tell me this,

620
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,400
...I hope I didn't hear about it either!

621
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,719
My son,

622
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:53,840
…didn't you just mention the names of these 17 souls one by one from the podium?

623
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:57,559
Will they not be held accountable? That's what I'm going to do!

624
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,079
Fariz, Mr. Agah is like this…

625
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,239
What happened? What happened?

626
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,599
- Come on, uncle. Come on, come on. - What happened?

627
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:08,519
- What happened? And what did I say? - Come, go, go.

628
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:10,119
- I'm asking something. - Come on, come on uncle, come on.

629
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:12,400
- I'm asking for an address. - Okay okay.

630
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:14,679
Well, I asked for an address.

631
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:18,039
- Come on, uncle, walk. - Oh, okay, don't push me.

632
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:19,159
I'm not pushing you, go ahead.

633
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:21,519
It's a shame, okay okay, I'm here okay.

634
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:23,800
Never again come to places where you are not invited.

635
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,480
God! God!

636
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,599
Heh!

637
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,039
Do you know the location of Destiny?

638
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,559
Uncle, I don't know.

639
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:46,159
But if I knew, I would tell you.

640
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:54,719
- Shh. Shh. - What?

641
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,519
I swear Agah, you have no other choice.

642
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,599
Open the glove compartment, there should be a key in there.

643
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,760
- Is this? - What! What!

644
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,960
Weren't you the apartment manager?

645
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,559
Which apartment?

646
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,679
Mebrure!

647
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,280
Oh Melek!

648
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,880
Oh, what have you prepared, in so much turmoil?

649
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:09,000
Oh, well done.

650
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,840
Well, I didn't make it, the neighbors did it and brought it.

651
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,840
Stuffed... My mother makes it very well.

652
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,639
Ramiz also loved it very much.

653
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:25,320
In other words, he would eat half a pot of stuffed vegetables in one sitting.

654
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,280
Do you know? I actually saw the deceased.

655
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:33,000
But it's been a while.

656
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:38,199
He came to the neighborhood to ask something from Hikmet.

657
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,800
I know I know.

658
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,119
- He wanted a gun. - What!

659
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,039
You made him look like you too.

660
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,920
Melek, look, I couldn't be a big brother to my brother.

661
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,239
I could neither hold his hand nor show him the way.

662
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,199
So he went and became a vagabond for three cents.

663
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,639
Then a guy came out and shot him, saying he was a bum to me.

664
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,280
It was my fault.

665
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,920
Because I left here.

666
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,360
My dear, can such a thing happen?

667
00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:17,239
What to do there. Just because you left, is it possible?

668
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,480
Angel!

669
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:23,599
Just because I left,

670
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:28,480
...if you loved Hikmet, anything is possible.

671
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,280
So I'm gone.

672
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:38,960
The world has turned upside down.

673
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:42,960
- Come on, honey, come on. - We'll wait again.

674
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:44,079
Thanks.

675
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:47,719
- Should we buy a smaller one? - No dear, just this, just come on.

676
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:50,320
- Pardon! - Pardon!

677
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,639
- Hello! - Here you go.

678
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:00,599
My son, I live upstairs. Can you help me?

679
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,760
I couldn't get this to work.

680
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,679
- Trouble for you. - Give it to me, let me take a look.

681
00:48:07,239 --> 00:48:09,840
- This one's battery is dead. - Really?

682
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,639
- Well, just put it on. - Let me put it on.

683
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,480
Heh... This place was a thing! It was a tavern.

684
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,800
That sign has legs.

685
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,320
- Isn't it? - Yes brother.

686
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:26,840
So what's happening now?

687
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:29,400
We sell fancy gadgets and stuff.

688
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:31,000
Fantasy.

689
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,760
Masallah. Yes. Well, eh?

690
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:39,360
Isn't it a bit shameful, in such a public place?

691
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,800
That sign outside or something. Uh, so.

692
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,480
There were no such things when we were young.

693
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,519
Well, people are looking for different things now. They are looking for new excitements.

694
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,400
If you need tools to get excited...

695
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,159
...so you're already dead. So leave these things alone.

696
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,440
What's the name of this?

697
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,239
Full Erotic Shop.

698
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:02,960
Full Erotic Shop.

699
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,400
Be my guest!

700
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:08,320
At least you could do it properly, couldn't you find a Turkish name?

701
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,760
How can I know!

702
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:11,920
Land of Lust, etc!

703
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,239
- Heh, it's opened. - Once it's opened, it's good.

704
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,480
Oh, would you take a look at his thing?

705
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:18,239
- For what? - You know, the one who calls, the one you seek,

706
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:20,159
...it's always written there! I am now...

707
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:22,639
- Let me see right away, brother. -...I don't remember, old phone.

708
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:28,400
I swear there is nothing in your call log. Or deleted.

709
00:49:28,679 --> 00:49:33,199
Let me take a look at your thing. Let me look at your guide.

710
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:36,360
- Pretty odd! - How strange?

711
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,360
- There's only one trick! - One trick!

712
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,119
Give this a call. Allah! Allah!

713
00:49:45,159 --> 00:49:46,280
Oh, live.

714
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,000
Has fate come?

715
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:48,400
It's here, commander.

716
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,519
Good good. Pour him some tea and let's drink it together.

717
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,599
Welcome, Destiny.

718
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,039
No kissing hands?

719
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,039
Pushshhhh... My daughter..

720
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,280
Pshhh...

721
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:36,880
- Damn, stop! What the hell is going on? - Where is Ulaş?

722
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,079
Answer, answer? What did you do to the child?

723
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,639
- Where to Reach? - Which one is Ulaş?

724
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,400
- Where is Ulaş? - Damn!

725
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,199
Who knows you best in this world?

726
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:16,679
What kind of a person he really is...

727
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:19,239
What you can do...

728
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,519
What are you afraid of...

729
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:25,440
Who knows what and how long you can endure?

730
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,960
My second...

731
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,840
Is it your brother...

732
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:32,880
Your friends...

733
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,719
Or is it your love...

734
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:39,320
None of them.

735
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,559
Because in this world, your partner in crime knows you the most.

736
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,679
Only he knows who he is.

737
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:48,559
I know.

738
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,440
Because I also have a partner in crime.

739
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:55,079
I mean, maybe I'm not an innocent, but.

740
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,440
At least I'm not alone in this world.
