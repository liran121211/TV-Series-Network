1
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,159
( breath )

2
00:02:46,039 --> 00:02:49,159
Oh dad, what a big deal you are!

3
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,000
You really didn't sit on your butt, it sank easily.

4
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,159
You lifted us all up. Ugh!

5
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,199
We haven't even had breakfast yet.

6
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,759
We'll do it girl, we'll do it, we'll do it when we get to the hotel.

7
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,240
No, also, for example, when did you book this hotel?

8
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,439
I set it up for a while.

9
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,520
- So we couldn't say goodbye to Mr. Tevfik. - Heh, I saw him.

10
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,840
I told you we were going. He said hello.

11
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,599
There is no father, you are stubborn! So you said what you said, it doesn't work like that.

12
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,319
You nailed it, you woke us all up early in the morning!

13
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,199
Of course I will remove it. This is my dream, baby.

14
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,520
- I've dreamed of this all my life. - What?

15
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,960
( Laugh )

16
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,719
(Unintelligible speeches)

17
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,000
- Wow, wow, wow, wow. - Here you go.

18
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,400
- Here you go, welcome. - Oh!

19
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:19,800
- (laughing) Dad, what did you do? - It will happen only once every forty years. Wow!

20
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,920
Dad, where did you find all this money?

21
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,600
- There was Mr. Tevfik. - Yes.

22
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:29,040
After you went to bed, we played poker with him until the morning.

23
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,279
(Breath) Dad, I swear, you are feared!

24
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,240
- It's obvious you ruined the man. - Aah, but I didn't do anything.

25
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,480
- You definitely ruined the man. (laughing) - He scratched his own itch.

26
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:58,720
(Fun shouts)

27
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,920
- Come here. Oops! - Dear Dad.

28
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,839
Were you able to ask about this Agah Beyoğlu? Did you find out why he was after you?

29
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,680
I couldn't ask anything, Meryem. I couldn't even speak properly.

30
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,120
You're right, of course. When you suddenly appear in front of you...

31
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:33,920
But I think there is! Agah is also their man.

32
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,519
No matter how they hid the name of the man, we haven't even heard of him all these years and all the research.

33
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,160
You just leave him alone. So what do we do now?

34
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,879
What will I say to this Destiny?

35
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:56,120
Give me my name. Let's come and meet as soon as possible.

36
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,839
- Are you sure? - Haven't we been waiting for this for years, Ruhi?

37
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,199
A lifetime has passed after these guys.

38
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,279
Have you reviewed this? What?

39
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,800
- No, I didn't examine it. - Look!

40
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,839
We are looking for Agah Beyoğlu. He was staying here with his family…

41
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,079
Just a second, sir, I'm checking right away.

42
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,000
(Unintelligible speeches)

43
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,040
- Sir, they checked out this morning. - Where did they go? Does anyone know?

44
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,279
So we cannot provide information about our guests. Please excuse me.

45
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,600
(Unintelligible speeches)

46
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,120
- Well, I call a nightlife friend and ask immediately. - Well, let's call.

47
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,199
Hello Farouk. Now there is a gentleman here…

48
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,240
- No, I don't know who he is. - Safety.

49
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,360
He was from the police.

50
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,000
So right now, I can already see him showing his ID.

51
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,240
So he wants information about our guests.

52
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,879
Spiritual! I gave you two days' grace period.

53
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,319
Why did you rush, brother?

54
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:36,160
So, tell me, who is so curious about our title?

55
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,759
Well, he wasn't a stranger...

56
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,839
Let him move on, I'll find him. Come on.

57
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,639
They are here.

58
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:05,879
Now we will do it like this. He gathered this Agah dynasty here.

59
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,000
We will have to distribute it.

60
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:15,680
We will take it one by one, Hikmet. Whichever one falls into our hands...

61
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,600
Here you go.

62
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,279
(Breath) How's it going? Are you bored of us?

63
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,559
- ( Laughing ) I'm not bored. -Huh.

64
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,759
They are all sweet people actually.

65
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,960
- That's fine. - Especially your grandfather.

66
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
Huh, it's very sweet.

67
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,720
( breath )

68
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,080
Did you bored?

69
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,600
Well...

70
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,519
- Of course, I might be a little bored. -Are you a little bored?

71
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,639
- I mean, I don't know, a little bit, I guess. - Really?

72
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,240
You're going to get it, is it a problem, huh, Fatoş?

73
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,960
- Are you going to take it or is it a problem, Fatoş? Huh? - I don't know.

74
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,159
(Unintelligible speeches)

75
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:42,159
So what's wrong with this? Talk to me, huh? Agah! Agah! Don't be silent, speak.

76
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Well, he has been your son-in-law for how many years, he is now considered your son.

77
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,519
Don't be shy, go and talk. Agah! Agah!

78
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:55,080
Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Run.

79
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,840
Dear Ertan!

80
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,559
- Oh, daddy, come, come, sit, sit. - Sit down

81
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,639
(Breath) Do you know? Actually, I understood that day.

82
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,799
- What did you get? - You know, I asked you, who didn't want me?

83
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,320
- I don't understand? - Didn't you take me and look after me at home?

84
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,840
You left it at the nursing home.

85
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:37,480
Then I said, who didn't want me? Of course, you couldn't answer correctly either.

86
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,279
But I understood. It was Zuhal, wasn't it?

87
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:46,200
- No, daddy. - No no. Now...

88
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,600
I have a request from you.

89
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,720
I say, you should talk to Zuhal.

90
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,879
If you take me with you. Let's all go to Australia together. Huh?

91
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,000
What do you say? I just sit in a corner and I won't be a burden to you.

92
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:13,200
So tell us as soon as possible so that we can make preparations, here is the passport, visa, fee stamp...

93
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,600
...Anyway, let's handle them, huh? What do you say?

94
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:17,919
Oh, daddy, I'll talk and talk...

95
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:23,639
...you were going to talk, I mean, you were going to say okay, I got better, my memory came back.

96
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,799
- We were going to leave, you were going to stay. - Well, okay, I talked...

97
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,600
...I spoke. I said, girl, I remember, I remember everything.

98
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,120
He didn't believe that he was awake!

99
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:39,000
Well, that's why you should talk to him as soon as possible.

100
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,480
She already wants to go to Australia, but she's afraid to stay here.

101
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,519
- Why should he be afraid, father! - Well, he pulled a gun.

102
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:52,320
Oh daddy, that issue is over. Years have passed and the man is no longer there.

103
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,480
- Who's missing? - Dog Killer.

104
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,440
- Serial killer. - Huh!

105
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,799
My son! What you said is not Turkish.

106
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,000
There is no such thing as serial killer in Turkish.

107
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:12,559
- So what do we say? - Also a repeat murderer.

108
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,639
Well, whatever it is, it's done. He killed twenty people.

109
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,200
- Why? - Well, it's not clear.

110
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:25,600
Look at the internet, you look at it for everything! It's written there.

111
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,879
No, daddy, he didn't write anything. So it's not clear. What's done is done, it's over.

112
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,799
You know, my father is mentally ill. She's wearing a cat costume!

113
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:49,399
Whatever he thinks he is now. He's just a poor guy. It's crazy, dad.

114
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,720
Do you know how a person feels when he finds out he is a repeat murderer?

115
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:27,600
He doesn't feel anything. But I guess a man who feels doesn't become a repeat murderer.

116
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,039
He says, "I wonder what reason I had for committing all those murders?"

117
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,200
So okay, after all, I'm just a grumpy guy who gets excited about everything.

118
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,120
But people cannot be killed in this!

119
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,480
I wonder what happened, Agah, who was an ant-crusher of forty years, left and became the Dog Killer!

120
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:57,759
Poor Agah, he took the gun in his hand, how old is the man disguised as a cat...

121
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,440
...why did you hide in that costume?

122
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,559
If only I could remember! I will finally understand who I am.

123
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,639
Dog Killer or Agah Beyoğlu?

124
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:41,600
Tewfik! Don't tire yourself out. It'll be fine, it'll be fine.

125
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,639
Everything will pass.

126
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,480
(difficulty breathing)

127
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:07,320
Tevfik, you released three men from the list.

128
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:16,759
(breath) In this case, you deserve to die three times.

129
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:23,960
(choking sounds)

130
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,400
(Unintelligible speeches)

131
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,240
Baba!

132
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,720
You don't hear it either, no one hears it!

133
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,599
( scream )

134
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,640
Baba!

135
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,440
Baba!

136
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,240
(Unintelligible speeches)

137
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,680
Fatosh, you tell me, my secretive son, he never tells such things.

138
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,039
Tell me what happens, I'm very curious, how did you meet, what happened with Deva?

139
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,359
- One day I watch a video. - What.

140
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,240
There, they show people jumping with parachutes.

141
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,720
- (laugh) - I said okay, I'll do it too.

142
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:42,240
- I went to Ölüdeniz. - What.

143
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:46,119
I packed everything and left the house. But how afraid I am.

144
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,319
- What. - I mean, my legs are shaking up there.

145
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,240
I was going to jump there with a teacher, I said sorry, I can't do it.

146
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:02,279
At that time, a man next to me said, Deva!

147
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:05,480
It calmed me down so well.

148
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,960
He said to me, I will make you fly.

149
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:14,119
We flew. We're still flying.

150
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:20,480
Do you know where this Deva's supreme calming ability comes from?

151
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,519
From me! I mean, when I say "from me", it doesn't mean "it was attracted to me", I mean...

152
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:30,559
My baby, he tried so hard with me...

153
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,880
- Oh... You know, right? - I know, you're an alcoholic.

154
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,680
(Exhale)

155
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,799
- Zuzu, I have something to tell you. - What.

156
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,519
I am very afraid of alcoholics.

157
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:05,920
And not just from alcoholics. That can be addicted to anything...

158
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,799
...I'm actually more afraid of everyone than anyone else.

159
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,279
Do you know how it feels to me?

160
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,160
It's like you can do anything at any time.

161
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,960
...as if a wild animal was standing in front of me and could attack me at any moment...

162
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:30,559
Or as if he would suddenly leave me and leave me at the moment when I trusted him the most.

163
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,839
That's why Zuzu...

164
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,519
- I expect everything from you. - I understand very well what you mean.

165
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,119
But let me make you a promise.

166
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,680
I will neither attack you nor abandon you.

167
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,359
Do you know when I'm most afraid of alcoholics?

168
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,799
When they promised me.

169
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:11,640
So Zuzu, you better not make any promises to me. You give me time. Is it possible?

170
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,880
This is a very strange girl, huh. I told you...

171
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,559
...when we came here five years ago....

172
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,839
...he brought a girl again, he found a girl named Süveda...

173
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:38,119
...the girl doesn't talk at all, then this girl shot a boy, one of her ordinary friends.

174
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:41,240
You know, pretty much like that, he shot him with a gun.

175
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,519
That's why I'm asking, is there really something in Devada?

176
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,720
(whisper) Where is the moon, there is a maniac. This kid finds it, I wonder why?

177
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,960
Dear Ertan, look, I do not accept this.

178
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,319
Ha, me, I became addicted because of my father.

179
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,079
But Deva did not become like this because of her mother.

180
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,720
( Breath ) So this happened because of me.

181
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,160
If there is a madman or a maniac, he finds them.

182
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,279
The child imitates his father. Isn't it?

183
00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:20,599
- (sigh) - Oh okay, I'm kidding.

184
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,720
- You're not doing it, Ertan. - I'm just kidding.

185
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,000
- You're not doing it, Ertan. - I'm just kidding.

186
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
- You don't. Let there be love. - Allah! Allah!

187
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,759
I thought a lot that day. Then I said, Agah, don't mess with it, leave the past behind.

188
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:00,839
Whatever happened happened, everything is clear.

189
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:07,680
Since you were able to commit murder over and over again. You're obviously used to horror.

190
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,880
In fact, you've gotten so used to it that you're worse than mad.

191
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:18,240
But it's over now. Maybe I can't change the past, but...

192
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,480
...I decide what will happen next, and most importantly, who I will be.

193
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,279
And that evening, right there, I resigned from my past.

194
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,440
I said yes, maybe I was a repeat murderer once, but...

195
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,359
...I will not repeat myself anymore.

196
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,319
- What happened, are you upset about something? - No.

197
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,720
There is something here.

198
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,000
I have a son, who should I tell about it?

199
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,799
- Tell me. - What.

200
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,839
- I always told you everything I had to say. - My problem is with myself.

201
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,119
What will happen if I tell you? What will happen if I don't tell you?

202
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,240
Grandpa, what do you say? Look how well you are healing.

203
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,079
- Huh. - I'm following too.

204
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,519
- You're getting better every day. - Really.

205
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,359
- Of course. - Huh.

206
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,160
Am I a good person?

207
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,279
Look, I won't know about that now.

208
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,079
It also depends on what's happening here.

209
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,200
Do you remember this? What? You know, you were always doing this to me.

210
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,480
No, I didn't remember. But I better not remember...

211
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,960
...I remember too much already.

212
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:05,200
- I'm glad you remembered, grandfather, I'm glad you remembered. - Hey my lion. ( laugh)

213
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,720
Oohh! Grandfather and grandson, no one hugs us

214
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:10,400
- Come, come, come, let's hug. (laugh) - I'm coming.

215
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,319
Come on of course..

216
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,799
- Oh... my dear daughter. - How am I?

217
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:19,160
You look so stylish, I make you look like a singer...

218
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,480
- What was his name? - Heh!. Am I cool?

219
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,920
- I understand. - Heh. Yes yes, do you understand?

220
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,039
(cheerful laughter)

221
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:37,880
(My beautiful sons, their mother's lambs, may God not separate us)

222
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:04,119
(Unintelligible speeches)

223
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,880
(new year celebration)

224
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,799
(cheerful new year's conversation)

225
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,039
(Unintelligible speeches)

226
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,279
(sellers-children-amusement park)

227
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,319
(screaming sounds)

228
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,319
( Scream - joyful sounds )

229
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,279
(rising screams)

230
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,359
( kids - clown - fun )

231
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,400
Thank you sister-in-law, thank you. Let's have a happy new year.

232
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,079
- Happy new year Yakup, say hello to your sisters. - Aleykumselam.

233
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:02,440
Wisdom! For God's sake, what is he doing in the middle of the night?

234
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,839
It's no big deal.

235
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,720
- I'll take care of it and come back in the morning. Don't worry. - Allah! Allah!

236
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,279
- Come on, happy new year. - Happy new year.

237
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,640
(Hard breathing)

238
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
(Street entertainment sounds)

239
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,519
(breathing sound)

240
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,319
(Unintelligible speeches)

241
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,599
- Dad! - What.

242
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:06,720
Look, everyone always has tattoos around here.

243
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,240
- Should we get a tattoo for you too? - Wow, what a tattoo, for God's sake, Zuhal.

244
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,839
No, but let me explain, let me tell you an idea.

245
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,240
Do you know what we will do?

246
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,839
I think it would be great to have AGAH written like this with a letter on each finger.

247
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,000
- It would be very nice, too. - ( laugh)

248
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,319
- Would you like another glass? - I do not drink.

249
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,480
In the past, tattoos were only available to sailors.

250
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,559
It actually happens to prisoners.

251
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,960
- Well, that's why everyone has tattoos now. - Of course.

252
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,279
So everyone feels like they are in prison.

253
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:45,319
Yes, we heard that there is a great Tango master among us.

254
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:45,920
- Dad! - What.

255
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,079
We invite him to the track to spice up our New Year's Eve.

256
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,640
- Either leave it or not now. Leave it to Zuhal, please. No. - Please, Dad, please.

257
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:57,279
- Tell your mother something. - Oh, say something too.

258
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,960
- Ahh! - Come on dad, please, please come on.

259
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:07,240
And voila. Tango champion, Agah Beyoğlu is coming.

260
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,480
(laugh) girl..

261
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,079
Oh, it's so sweet.

262
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,839
(applause-cheering)

263
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:07,359
- Thanks. - Oh! Thank you very much.

264
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,079
Dad, have you seen you, you are gorgeous, just like before. You never forgot.

265
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:16,200
(continue applause)

266
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,839
- Yes. - Mr. Agah, I see that you have not lost any of your form.

267
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,240
Oh sir. We did something.

268
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,000
- Well, I'm coming...right away. - Like meditation...

269
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:39,559
...or this year, we definitely have to go to Australia, girl, I'm sure you'll love it.

270
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,720
I'm going to the toilet, my love. See you later.

271
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,000
See you soon, darling.

272
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,160
Let me go to this room and change my clothes.

273
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,759
- I'm not used to this, you know. - Oh, my dear Deva!

274
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:59,319
If you're going to go to the room, bring my father's medicine. Your mother forgot.

275
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:03,400
- Daddy, will you drink your medicines? - We have to drink.

276
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,720
Okay, okay, let me go and get it.

277
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,759
(whispering) Ertan, Ertan, come on.

278
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,079
What happened, are we going to Australia? Have you talked to Zuhal?

279
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,359
Oh, I haven't been able to talk yet, I haven't had the chance, dad, I will.

280
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,240
Son, what did I tell you? Didn't I say we should leave as soon as possible? Allah! Allah!

281
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:37,039
- What's going on? - He becomes blind.

282
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,319
My son! Why can't you talk to your wife? Why can't you say anything?

283
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,720
Okay, I'll tell you, I'll talk, okay.

284
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,039
Okay, I will say, I will talk, I will, I will...

285
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,000
...your life was like this. Such is your life. I couldn't understand you, I really couldn't understand you.

286
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,319
I never understood. You are wandering around...

287
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:03,799
...it is not clear what you are doing, it is not clear whether you are present or not.

288
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,079
Tell me, what is your purpose in this life?

289
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:14,360
- What use are you? - Me?

290
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:19,639
I act as a figuration in the story of the Beyoğlu family.

291
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,880
I'll go out and get some fresh air.

292
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,679
( Laugh )

293
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
Sir dear, are you going to say something?

294
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,480
- I was going to say don't upset Deva again. - What?

295
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,920
Whatever you're doing right now, don't let it be anything that will upset Deva.

296
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,679
- As you said, he tried hard with me at the time. - Yes.

297
00:35:29,079 --> 00:35:31,159
And don't bother with that.

298
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,480
Aah! Had size bucket.

299
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,000
(Fun sounds)

300
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:02,920
(Enthusiasm - cheering)

301
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:30,360
(Enthusiasm - cheering continues below)

302
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,320
- Is it clear who we will take? - No, whatever comes along.

303
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,639
( Laugh )

304
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,400
(Unintelligible speeches)

305
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,119
(Unintelligible speeches)

306
00:37:52,320 --> 00:38:04,079
Remedy! Ah! Let me go, let me go, let me go aahh, aah, let me go, let me go, let me go.

307
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,360
Sometimes one feels so alone or so helpless...

308
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,320
...he says okay, I understand. This world is a trap set against me...

309
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:37,159
...even a mine. I stepped on it the day I was born.

310
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:42,280
If I move my foot now, that big world will blow up.

311
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:48,559
That's why you freeze where you stand. He's afraid to even breathe.

312
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,920
All that remains is loneliness. And an enemy.
