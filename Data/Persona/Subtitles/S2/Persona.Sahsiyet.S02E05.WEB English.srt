00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,679
Front. Nine. Eight.....

2
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:33,799
New Year is celebrated with great enthusiasm in Kartalkaya.

3
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,799
This New Year's Eve, as every year, more than a hundred ski instructors...

4
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,079
...here with the torches in their hands...

5
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,159
...they present an unforgettable visual feast to the enthusiastic crowd here.

6
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,479
We celebrate your new year. We want you to stay with love.

7
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:04,239
We wish you such a happy, loving, healthy and peaceful year, sir.

8
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,799
Thank you very much for being with us and watching us.

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,079
(screaming - young people having fun)

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:29,359
(with difficulty) No, leave it, leave it, leave it, leave it..

11
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,120
( celebration )

12
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:58,640
( straining ) let go, let go, let go.

13
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,639
( breath )

14
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,080
Happy New Year, Mary.

15
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,199
- Where? - What where?

16
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,000
- Where? - Stop, stop, stop.

17
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,879
- First, let me ask you another question? - What are you going to ask?

18
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,159
Are you going to kill me?

19
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,520
- Or are you going to have them killed? - What killing? What are you talking about?

20
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,039
We are not like you. I'm not like you.

21
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,560
You know those men, those Tevfiks, Fahris...

22
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,199
...we went and asked them many times.

23
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,400
We asked, "For God's sake, where are they?" Where?

24
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,719
We don't know, they said. Only Destiny knows.

25
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:26,479
Only he knows! It's been thirty years! Thirty years!

26
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,879
Look! I do not want anything from you!

27
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,159
See what you're up to! Find it from God!

28
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,240
But I'm begging you. Please tell me, where is it?

29
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,199
We hope that this new year will bring joy to our country, our world, everyone...

30
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,919
...brings health, tranquility, peace and happiness.

31
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,439
Let's not forget that every new year is a new beginning.

32
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,039
Yes, if we want our lives to be filled with goodness and beauty in this new year...

33
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,879
... let's know that this is in our hands...

34
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:01,240
If you want to make new decisions tonight, now is the time!

35
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,400
Yes, now let's ask our holidaymakers who are entering the new year in Kartalkaya...

36
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,159
Let's see what they expect from this new year.

37
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:12,319
Have they made any resolutions about what they will do in the new year?

38
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,759
Sir, happy new year, happy new year!

39
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,160
Sir, is there anything you want to say about the new year?

40
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:45,519
Where did you bury these people?

41
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,199
Where did you bury my father?

42
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,680
At least, let's find his bones! So I passed everything…

43
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,439
At least these people should have a grave!

44
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,399
I'm not the only one. Look, we are not the only ones, there are so many families.

45
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,439
They all want only one thing. Just finding your bones is all!

46
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
Tell those families...

47
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,959
...all cases have entered the statute of limitations.

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,519
What does this mean? So they will forget.

49
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
That's why... There is also a court decision...

50
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,360
- You have to, you will forget. - Destiny

51
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,720
You will do only one thing. You just tell me the location of the mass grave and that's it.

52
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,279
After that, whatever you do, wherever you go.

53
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,240
What do you want? Do you want money, how much money you want, let's meet and give it to you.

54
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,839
Whatever you want, I don't know, whatever you want.

55
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,920
There is nothing I want from you. I received what I wanted on time.

56
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,120
This is over. This business is closed.

57
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,199
He left now. It's going down.

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,800
I saw it, okay. I'm following you, don't worry.

59
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,040
- My wife disappeared. - When did he disappear?

60
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:04,600
It's been an hour or so. We were eating inside at the hotel. Then he got up and left...

61
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,040
- I keep calling but he doesn't answer. - Was there an argument or something?

62
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,160
No.

63
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,319
- You know, New Year's Eve, alcohol etc... - No, no, no, no.

64
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,360
- Are you sure? - Yes.

65
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,360
- So what? - His wife has disappeared.

66
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:23,040
How? Did he suddenly disappear, sir?

67
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,439
- What should I do, can you tell me? - Has this happened before?

68
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,800
What happened?

69
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,399
So, your wife went off on her own? Has he ever disappeared before?

70
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,600
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

71
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,759
How could he have "escaped"? How?

72
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,080
Because Fatoş is running away, father. This girl has been running away like this all her life!

73
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,080
Why do you think he never meets his family?

74
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,279
Because that guy, who will be his father, will drink and drink his mother every night...

75
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,879
...then he was beating Fatoş!

76
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,840
Is it ok? Do we have a deal now? The girl's entire childhood was like this!

77
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,240
Fatoş also ran away from home all the time.

78
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,399
He doesn't talk to anyone anyway, he never meets his mother or father.

79
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,759
Come on son, okay, he doesn't talk to his father, why doesn't he talk to his mother?

80
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,159
He is also very angry with his mother because she never left his father.

81
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,200
Oh, that's the kid! What does he know...

82
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,600
This time he escaped from me! I know.

83
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,679
My son, why should he run away from you?

84
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,080
What happened, did you do something to this girl, did you fight, what happened, what is it?

85
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,600
Well, I didn't do it...

86
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,879
What? Me? What did I do?

87
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:47,399
Ms. Zuhal...

88
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,159
...I'm sorry, but this is such a coincidence.

89
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,720
So I was reading your book, and when I saw it here, I brought it immediately.

90
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,480
- Can I have an autograph, please? - Of course, who should I tell?

91
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,279
- Filiz'e. - Filiz.

92
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,320
- If only I could take a selfie. - Of course.

93
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,399
Madam, would you excuse me?

94
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,320
- We are talking about something here. - Sorry, later.

95
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,159
You said so. Here, everything is in its place in the bedroom.

96
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,159
Doesn't someone who wants to escape take a few things with him?

97
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,120
Do you know how he got out of the house the last time he ran away, dad?

98
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,200
Barefoot!

99
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,159
My son, don't talk nonsense, for God's sake, look...

100
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,480
...you panicked, Deva, right now, you can't think clearly!

101
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,399
Is it ok. Let's say this girl ran away.

102
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,679
No, for example, why don't you think like this first, where are we right now...

103
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,600
...we are in the mountains. Snow, ice! Isn't it? Let's say this girl fell down...

104
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,919
...he broke his foot or leg somewhere, couldn't it be?

105
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,759
Why don't you think about this first?

106
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:47,679
- Then I'll go. You know those rescue teams? - Yes.

107
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:49,639
Let me go and ask them.

108
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,639
- Well, ask me. Ask of course. - Come on son, let me see.

109
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,120
Ugh, see how everything came crashing down on me?

110
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:02,159
(laugh) I'm going crazy, I'm responsible for everything.

111
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,240
Dad, what should we do, let's call the hospitals or something, right?

112
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,840
What did you say to the girl now? Of course you talked back and forth, and the girl couldn't stand it.

113
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,240
Is it me, everyone? (laugh)

114
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,320
- Did you see? - No.

115
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,399
Hehe, Fatoş yes.

116
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay okay, thank you very much.

117
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,759
- My wife disappeared, have you ever seen her? - I didn't see.

118
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,600
- Agah! - Huh!

119
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,120
Is it?

120
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,159
(Unintelligible speeches)

121
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,600
Why did you return home?

122
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,120
I'm back.

123
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,639
Where were you dead?

124
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,879
Look, look how well I undress. (laugh) They shot your brother.

125
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,159
I know, mom.

126
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,200
They told me, come and look. Do you know me? (laugh)

127
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,919
I said, don't I know him, my son, he is mine.

128
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,679
They also laid him in such a cold place.

129
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,799
I said, you will freeze the boy. ( breath)

130
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:29,039
The lives of people I have never met depend on me from morning to night, right there in the air?

131
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:40,200
One jump, then you're in the void, everything is left to me.

132
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,039
Think about what kind of responsibility this is. Even the slightest mistake...

133
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
Oh, God forbid.

134
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,200
So, I treat Fatoş the same way.

135
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,279
As if his life depended on me too...

136
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,440
...I guess I'm constantly turning around like crazy...

137
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,679
(Nida) I drowned the girl, so!

138
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,600
Don't be like that, Deva, but don't blame yourself.

139
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:25,960
Wait a minute, let it happen in the morning. Let's see, of course there will be news.

140
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,600
Will it really come?

141
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,320
Of course it will come. Of course it will come.

142
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,679
Here you go.

143
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,279
They called you a murderer. Neighbors said.

144
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,200
I said, such a thing is not possible. He was just born, he's a baby.

145
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:08,440
How did you become a murderer, son? When did you grow up and become a murderer?

146
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:16,879
- Where are you going, stop, don't go. - I'm not going, I'm not going, I'm here.

147
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:18,639
- Oh, good. - I am her.

148
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:25,120
You go and ask your father to give you pajamas.

149
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:33,960
Oh, your brother will come soon. Oh, if you only knew how happy he will be when he sees you.

150
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,240
Come on, may God give you peace, my son.

151
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:22,440
İbrahim!

152
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,319
Is there anyone?

153
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,039
Where are you?

154
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,839
Is there anyone?

155
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,200
This is not here either...

156
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,400
Where are these guys, where are these guys?

157
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,000
- Agah, don't shout, you'll wake people up. - Let them wake up if they wake up!

158
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,960
There is no fatosh, they kidnapped the girl, who knows what they are doing.

159
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,839
(Don't cry)

160
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,359
No!

161
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,720
(Don't cry)

162
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,319
Don't be like that Agah, don't cry.

163
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,519
How can I not cry! They kidnapped the girl because of me, all because of me.

164
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,000
Who knows what they are doing now.

165
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,680
- Agah! Agah! - What?

166
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,880
I told you. I told you at the time.

167
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,799
I said, "Go, find these men, kill them all one by one."

168
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,599
But what did you say? How should I do it, Mebrure?

169
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,200
So what did you do next, huh?

170
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,920
No, let's run away to Australia with the kids, no, take me with you!

171
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,720
So, what happened? Did it work?

172
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,480
Look, they kidnapped the girl!

173
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,759
- Agah! - What?

174
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,880
Go and do your murder.

175
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,599
Get yourself together.

176
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,799
- Well, you are a repeat murderer. - Huh.

177
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,200
- They even called you "Dog Killer". - Huh.

178
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,200
Don't cry around here.

179
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:14,480
- What's that sound? Where does it come from? - For aught I know?

180
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:21,559
- Is that voice coming from you? - No, hee..

181
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:27,079
- Agah Beyoğlu. - I'm Hikmet too. Listen to me carefully...

182
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,839
Come on, let's get this over with. Don't let any more innocent people get hurt.

183
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,559
Would you like some tea?

184
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,559
How will we finish this?

185
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,799
- Come on, sit down. - I'm not sitting anywhere!

186
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,000
Where is Fatoş, what did you do to the girl?

187
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,599
Come, let's have a tea, I will tell you everything.

188
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,279
I wouldn't drink anything with a murderer like you!

189
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:57,799
Look, it's true. I shot a lot of people.

190
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,920
I have taken many lives, although not as many as you, but I did not take them from you.

191
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:05,720
What do you mean, I didn't take it, I saw it with my own eyes, you kidnapped the girl.

192
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,319
We missed it, I missed it. I kidnapped the girl to save her life.

193
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,559
What do you mean, his life should be saved?

194
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,200
- The girl is alive, Agah. - I don't believe you!

195
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:20,519
Where is the girl? What did you do to Fatoş? Tell the truth!

196
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:29,079
Al!

197
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,160
- Look at this! - What is that?

198
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,119
- Fatos! - Heh!

199
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,839
Look, he's alive!

200
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,680
Take a look at this!

201
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:01,480
Fatoş, are you okay, girl? Fatosh!

202
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,240
It's a live camera view, where should he hear it?

203
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:07,359
What, how live camera, so, is it there now?

204
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:10,880
Wow, you've completely abandoned yourself, Agah, you don't know anything about the world!

205
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:14,640
- So, is the girl alive? - Yes, he is alive.

206
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,759
I have a hut, it's there now right now.

207
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:19,200
So he's not dead.

208
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,240
- No! - God bless you.

209
00:23:22,279 --> 00:23:29,240
God bless you. God bless you. I am very pleased. Ayy, thank you very much.

210
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,519
Hand over the girl to me.

211
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:35,680
Is that a hut or whatever it is, take me there!

212
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,519
That job is not that easy! Destiny doesn't know that the girl is alive.

213
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,319
I said it? I kidnapped him to save his life. If you just listen, you will understand me.

214
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:55,359
- Is there any sugar? - Drink without sugar. I let go, so do you.

215
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:05,880
Now Agah Effendi...

216
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:12,480
…let's say someone in your family passed away. How many days will you mourn for it?

217
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,000
Forty days!

218
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,920
Is this Destiny going to kill your family? How will he kill?

219
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:25,720
He killed someone, let's say one of us, and shot a member of your family. What will he do?

220
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,640
Destiny will wait forty days.

221
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:35,000
On the forty-first day, he will have another person killed. Then he will wait another forty days.

222
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,839
He's going to get someone killed again. Do you understand the calculation?

223
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,960
You will mourn for forty days!

224
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,680
Then you will just come out of mourning and someone else will die.

225
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:51,279
Do you know what fate told us?

226
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,000
We will not let that Agah Beyoğlu out of his mourning!

227
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,319
One mourning will end, the next will begin!

228
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:10,839
Like this, until, one by one, he killed his entire family...

229
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,000
...and then until I kill that dog!

230
00:25:15,079 --> 00:25:16,559
This man is sick.

231
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,839
Well, what revenge? What have I done to whom that he is taking revenge on me?

232
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:29,960
Did you shoot your brother?

233
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,279
How? What about me, how should I know? Who is whose brother?

234
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,519
Well, you went to the prosecutor and told him!

235
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,279
- You said that you shot three men in Beyoğlu at night. - Yes.

236
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,559
Well, one of them was Kader's brother.

237
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:47,880
Them! Oh! Oh! Oh! From where to where? What does that have to do with anything?

238
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,079
And of course, as if you were mocking, you put a label on the children's foreheads saying "Personal".

239
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,319
I don't remember that! I don't remember who I shot and why?

240
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:57,799
Anyway, it's done.

241
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,240
Let's see how we can save your bride.

242
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,720
Yes, tell me that now. What are we going to do? How are we going to do?

243
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:12,000
I swear, I thought, this is the easiest way to do it.

244
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,799
- Lower back! Lower back! - Hi!

245
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,200
- Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk!

246
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,240
(whispering) Why does this help you?

247
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,279
- Wasn't this the man of Destiny? - What. Heh!

248
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,559
- Well, let me ask you something! - Ask.

249
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,200
Why are you helping me?

250
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,920
There was a girl. Your bride is around the same age...

251
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,160
That's when we got into something.

252
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:00,759
Anyway, long story short, they gave us a list.

253
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,920
- Who gave it? - Never mind now.

254
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:10,119
They said, these will be resolved. So we started kidnapping the men one by one and shooting them.

255
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:14,519
Anyway, one day, we went to pick up a man from this list again.

256
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:24,599
The man next to me is also excited. We even call him Crazy Jacob.

257
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,720
We entered the man's house. We know that some people have no one.

258
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,400
(Struggle sounds)

259
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,359
It turns out that he has a daughter at university in Istanbul. At that time, school was on holiday and the girl came out.

260
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,319
We've captured the man and are taking him away.

261
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:48,799
( Scream )

262
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,480
Of course it was a mess. At that moment, the man untied his hands and jumped on us...

263
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:59,240
- (Struggling sounds) - Stop!

264
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,079
- Stop! - Let me go, let me go.

265
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,000
( breath )

266
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,240
Of course, we couldn't leave the girl there.

267
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,880
I said, "- I have a hut, let's lock it there for now."

268
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,559
( Scream )

269
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,920
(Scream-Crying)

270
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:42,440
What should we do? Should we call Kader?

271
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,480
We made a phone call to Kader somewhere. I spoke.

272
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,599
What did he say?

273
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,359
There is such a situation that...

274
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,119
...if I said to Yakup, Destiny said, leave the girl alone, scare her and leave her.

275
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:25,200
Neither Kader nor Yakup will know that I am lying.

276
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,480
Such a task.

277
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:37,440
But me, at that moment! Whatever mood I'm in.

278
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:44,680
How I became a tin soldier like this. I couldn't tell that lie.

279
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,160
Actually, I wanted to say.

280
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,839
I said, tell me what will happen! Tell a lie and the girl's life will be saved.

281
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:06,079
I couldn't do it. So there is. No one would know about it.

282
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,599
But it didn't happen.

283
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,039
That evening...

284
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,599
Destiny is not there, I acted as Destiny to myself. Do you understand?

285
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:22,240
"Shoot the girl," he said.

286
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:25,640
ok

287
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,680
I couldn't sleep at all after that.

288
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:37,640
That's why... When it comes to fate, Agah's family will die first.

289
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,440
It never occurred to me from the beginning.

290
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,640
I said, this only happens once. I will never shoot anyone who is not in a fight again.

291
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,720
Then he said, go and kidnap someone. I volunteered too.

292
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,640
He gave Crazy Yakup to me again, as if there was no other man.

293
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,000
History will repeat itself, but I'm not the same!

294
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,400
We picked up your bride from the hotel. We took it.

295
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,599
You wait, I'll handle it.

296
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,640
- Quiet, quiet. Come here slow. Heh. - (Exclamation-crying)

297
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,400
- Come, walk. Calm down. - (Exclamation-crying)

298
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,680
Thank God for Yakup's life, he also has fifty problems.

299
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,720
No, his back hurts, no, he has hemorrhoids...

300
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:29,880
- Don't make noise, don't make noise. - (crying) Let go! Leave!

301
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:34,039
(cry)

302
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,680
Shsht.

303
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:45,160
So, you see, Jacob also knows that his daughter is dead.

304
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,880
Now, if I hand over this bride to you...

305
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,119
...Kader will definitely know about it.

306
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,200
Then he sends someone else and has him shoot him.

307
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,440
As I told you, it will make you mourn for forty days.

308
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:03,720
This means he will wait forty days until he kills someone else.

309
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,319
What I say to you is this:

310
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,359
Let me keep this girl so she can survive!

311
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:15,759
Let me tell you, that's all we have, we just killed the girl.

312
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,680
But don't expect more.

313
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,599
Whatever problem you have with Agah, go and solve it with Agah.

314
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:23,559
Don't involve his family or anything.

315
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,640
Is useful? I don't know.

316
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:34,079
But is it worth a try? Well worth it.

317
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,759
Because... that evening I...

318
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,640
...that I couldn't come out of that phone booth and lie...

319
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,079
I am so sorry.

320
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,960
Ha, let's say it didn't work.

321
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:53,519
At least your bride will be saved. Ready Destiny also knows he is dead.

322
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,039
How will all this end now? Of course it will end because one day...

323
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,440
...then I will release the girl and she will go away.

324
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,720
But let me tell you something. Do you regret it now? Because the girl died.

325
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,200
It's not just that, Hikmet.

326
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,839
You know, they gave you a list and you killed them all.

327
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,160
What will their burden be?

328
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,559
In other words, that burden cannot be lightened by saving just one life!

329
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:28,519
Are you going to get away with this just because you saved Fatoş's life?

330
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:34,359
Your sentence is seventeen life imprisonments!

331
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,200
I wish I said that.

332
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,599
You didn't say! Can I say, are you a child?

333
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,400
The man is doing something on his own there to save the girl.

334
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,519
Am I going to confuse the man by saying these things now?

335
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,079
Then his conscience is his own conscience, it is his own business, his own problem.

336
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,039
The girl is safe, that's important.

337
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,519
- You did wrong, but I think. - Why?

338
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,319
You were going to put the gun to her head, you were going to find out where the girl was!

339
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,119
You would find the girl, you would kill this Hikmet.

340
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,880
Then you were going to kill the others.

341
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,679
Oh, so you're saying, go shoot them all.

342
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,599
You can kill people, I swear, Mebrure!

343
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,920
Well, I don't need to do anything.

344
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,920
I'll just sit and wait for news from Hikmet, that's all.

345
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,800
Oh, and of course I have to move the kids somewhere else.

346
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,599
Because they know the address of the hotel.

347
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,000
Destiny won't attack right away, that's obvious... I still need moisture.

348
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:41,039
Wow! There is a cure, a cure! The kid is going crazy...

349
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,960
Who knows how curious he is about Fatoş?

350
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,000
Won't you say anything to him?

351
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,760
- Wouldn't I say? - Well, then, whatever you say.

352
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:01,800
( Laugh )

353
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,480
My cure, I swear I was abandoned too at the time,

354
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,440
Stuff like this happened to me when I was young.

355
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,079
You won't mind, son, you won't mind, one goes, the other comes.

356
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,719
Especially a handsome man like you, I swear they won't let you go!

357
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,719
So grandpa, what you say is so useless right now.

358
00:35:43,239 --> 00:35:45,880
So it doesn't work that well.

359
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,079
Besides, she's my wife! Fatosh is my wife.

360
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:53,519
How can I not worry!

361
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,760
No, it's not comfortable for me at all.

362
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:10,719
Oh my son, trust me. I feel such things, I swear, look.

363
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,159
Fatoş is fine, she has nothing.

364
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,599
As you said, it goes like that from time to time.

365
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,239
Apparently the girl is listening to her head.

366
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,960
You too, don't bother. So don't do too much, girl. What?

367
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:30,679
Where are we going, at least tell me.

368
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:35,320
- Aren't you a paratrooper? - I am, huh?

369
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,360
Well, you must know how to jump into unfamiliar places.

370
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,960
Come on, jump, come on, come on, step on the gas, come on, come on. (laugh)

371
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:48,400
I'll take this, I'll take that, I'll take that too.

372
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,960
- Dear Deva, what do you want? - I don't want anything, thank you.

373
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,559
- Son, tell me something and I'll buy it for you too. - I don't want it, grandpa.

374
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,320
My son, you need to eat, you will still grow.

375
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,159
A child in his developmental age needs to eat, right?

376
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,360
- Oh grandpa! - What!

377
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,239
How do you do this!

378
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,920
- Huh? - What am I doing?

379
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:12,639
No fatosh, grandpa! My wife is nowhere to be seen!

380
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,920
But you're just kidding like nothing happened!

381
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,559
I haven't blinked an eye since the night thinking that this phone was going to ring!

382
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:25,360
(message sound)

383
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,119
- Oh, he came. - What came?

384
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,639
I swear, a message came from Fatoş!

385
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,400
From Fatoş?

386
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:53,800
( Horn sound )

387
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,719
Did the message come from Fatoş? Are you sure?

388
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,880
Yeah yeah. I'm calling but he still doesn't answer.

389
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,440
What does he write, what does he say?

390
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:41,639
Destiny separated us...

391
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,119
- Destiny? - Yes, that's what he wrote.

392
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,239
Destiny separated us. But fate will bring us together again, he says.

393
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,960
And he says hello.

394
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,119
- To who? - To you!

395
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,559
Come on Fatoş, please pick up the phone. Come on my Fatoş!

396
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:11,000
As I said, there is not a single Agah in me.

397
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,480
But there are lots of them.

398
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,599
In fact, they are all angry with each other.

399
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,840
No, actually I said it wrong. I should have said sad, not angry.

400
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,760
Instead of a lot, a bouquet...

401
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,360
...yes...I have a bouquet of Agah inside me.

402
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:46,199
Because when I see what this world is like,

403
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,360
...such a sadness fell on me... I was crushed under it like a flower.

404
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,559
That's why I have neither scent nor color left in this deep blue world.

405
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,920
I am not between two pages of a notebook...

406
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,920
...I am a dried flower among millions of people.
