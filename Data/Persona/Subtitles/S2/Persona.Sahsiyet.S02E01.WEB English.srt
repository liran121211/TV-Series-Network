1
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,599
Everything in this life has an end.

2
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,599
Some people sit quietly and wait for that end to come to them.

3
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,400
Some people get up and walk.

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,840
He goes to the end on his own.

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,760
I made a decision.

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,880
Since I started this story,

7
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,840
I will bring the end to it.

8
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:00,639
This story is not another one,

9
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,599
I will finish it.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,480
Agah Beyoğlu…

11
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,360
Tell me.

12
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:28,360
Officer... I did it...

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,519
All those people… I killed them.

14
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:34,119
One by one…

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,199
All…

16
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,719
Do not do that! How many times have I told you!

17
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,480
What the hell, he's having fun!

18
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,199
Okay, but his blood pressure will rise.

19
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,000
(unintelligible speech)

20
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:40,800
Especially my wife will take care of her. Thank you.

21
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,639
I mean, it was the bathroom, the toilet, etc.

22
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,079
He will always handle it.

23
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,280
That's why we won't need an extra babysitter, thank you.

24
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,639
Well, whatever you want.

25
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,239
Well! Then if you sign your release papers…

26
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,159
- Come on, let's go to my room. - Ok.

27
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,280
When I first walked into that nursing home, I was faking it.

28
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,480
It was as if the disease had progressed and I had become disconnected from the world.

29
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:11,000
The best place to hide after all those murders,

30
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,719
It was a disease called Alzheimer's.

31
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,639
But apparently the trick turned out to be real.

32
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,559
I was trapped in my hiding place... I didn't know it.

33
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:25,360
Baba!

34
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:29,199
Father. Get up dad, come on, we're going home.

35
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:35,480
Baba!

36
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,880
What happened?

37
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
What's the part of this? Heh!

38
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,599
What if, my dear, we could go to a hotel?

39
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:01,599
As I said, it is very important for Ertan to be in an environment he knows.

40
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,239
So there needs to be something around him that will jog his memory.

41
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,239
Hah! Father! Isn't it my mother?

42
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,599
Mebrure? Did you remember?

43
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,280
How can the man remember? For God's sake!

44
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,679
Father!

45
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,079
Now look!

46
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,280
You will drink this, okay?

47
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,320
It'll all be over, let's see.

48
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:33,199
Drink, drink, drink… Okay.

49
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,239
Baba!

50
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,639
You know, you left me at boarding school!

51
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,440
I was so little!

52
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,320
Do not worry about it!

53
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,159
I won't leave you.

54
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:45,599
Is it ok?

55
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,159
Come on. Look at my mother!

56
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,360
Saturn!

57
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,239
Come on dad.

58
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,199
What happened?

59
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,840
My love, this man hasn't said a word for years.

60
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,079
He doesn't react to anything other than Tom Jones!

61
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,800
Well! I don't understand how you think you will get better.

62
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,760
No, now how did this biochemist give you this medicine!

63
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,400
In other words, it is not even clear whether it is a medicine or not, it has not been tested, it has not been made, it has not been looked at!

64
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,639
Maybe it has a side effect, don't you ever think about it?

65
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,920
Where did it go?

66
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,840
He is wandering around his house.

67
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:40,800
DAY 1

68
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,960
DAY 17

69
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:20,840
Daddy!

70
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,359
Have you ever come back from the dead?

71
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,600
I'm back…

72
00:08:56,439 --> 00:08:57,680
But where did I turn?

73
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,000
Turns out that was the real issue.

74
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,800
Ok, I came back to life...

75
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Where exactly did I end up in that life?

76
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,560
What did I do!

77
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,319
I forgot to give water to Münir Bey!

78
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,760
Mr. Munir! Where are you, my son Münir!

79
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,920
Aah! Zuhal!

80
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,119
No, what are you doing here? When did you come?

81
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,159
Dad, do you know me?

82
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:31,640
Do you know what it means? Are you kidding me girl?

83
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,239
I'm looking for Münir Bey. Have you seen him? Tell him!

84
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,479
Mr. Munir! There was a water container here!

85
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,079
The child had a water bowl, but now he doesn't have a water bowl.

86
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,640
Mr. Münir, where are you, son!

87
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,159
Was this left in the bathroom?

88
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,279
Don't let it be locked! Munir!

89
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,520
- Thank God! Daddy! - Come on! Who is there!

90
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,399
- Daddy! Do you remember me? - Who is there! Mr. Münir, did you stay there?

91
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,520
Girl, what are you saying? What does it mean to remember!

92
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,439
Well, it worked, huh! The medicine worked!

93
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:01,239
Hayda!

94
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:03,159
Ertan, my father knows me.

95
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
What are you doing here?

96
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,359
- He recognized you too! Thank God. - What's up, Ertan? You wouldn't come to your hometown!

97
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:13,319
Wait a minute! How did you get in!

98
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,359
Did you have the key too?

99
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:17,479
Daddy!

100
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,199
Girl, what happened, why are you crying?

101
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,680
Did something happen to Deva?

102
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,560
Deva, he said! Deva says!

103
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,319
What should I say, should I say Mahmut? The child's name is Deva, right?

104
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:30,159
Wait a minute, could you have left the door open? Ertan!

105
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,680
Did you leave the door open and he ran away, Mr. Münir?

106
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,680
- My daddy! - Look, if you did something like this. We change the cones accordingly!

107
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,199
Okay okay okay. Nothing, okay. Mr. Munir!

108
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:42,359
That biochemist of yours will win the Nobel Prize, for sure!

109
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:43,399
Mr. Munir!

110
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,359
Dad, do you really remember everything?

111
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,000
My daughter!

112
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:48,640
- When and what did I forget! - Heh!

113
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,159
What was your surname, daddy?

114
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,560
Are you kidding me, are you making fun of me, son?

115
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,760
Is there any other Beyoğlu left in Beyoğlu other than me?

116
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,600
- Mr. Munir! Mr. Munir! Where is this kid? - This is a miracle, I swear it is a miracle.

117
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,399
- Dad! Let me ask you something too.. - Mr. Münir!

118
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,800
- What? - Dad, what were you doing?

119
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,840
- Where did you retire from? - Girl, for God's sake, go and find another entertainment for yourself.

120
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,600
What were you doing, Daddy? Where did you retire from?

121
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,479
Grandmother ? How where? Say well!

122
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,640
Where is dad?

123
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:15,880
Well, I was doing something!

124
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,800
What were you doing?

125
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,319
Well, I was doing something!

126
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,600
Courthouse clerk?

127
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:38,880
I studied law, what's the point!

128
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,319
You haven't finished university, daddy. You left when you married my mother.

129
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,000
How many years did you say?

130
00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:48,359
Twenty seven.

131
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,000
Twenty-seven years! Was I a courthouse clerk for twenty-seven years?

132
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,239
There is no such thing, there is something wrong. No such thing!

133
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:58,960
Baba!

134
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,399
Heh!

135
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Look! Look now, look at this photo.

136
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,159
Look, this is the Ardıçhan courthouse.

137
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,479
Is it ok?

138
00:12:06,479 --> 00:12:08,359
Look, you know what's here?

139
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,760
Look, for example, these photos were taken in Silopi.

140
00:12:12,119 --> 00:12:17,600
Look who's around you? All your friends and colleagues from the courthouse.

141
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,520
Now you tell me that I have spent my entire life in civil service,

142
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,600
That's what you're telling me!

143
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,439
No, daddy, it's not like that, but you were very happy,

144
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:31,520
- So you loved what you did. - How do you know?

145
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,399
Heh!. How do you know I'm happy?

146
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,640
I mean, you looked like that, daddy.

147
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,560
So I was deceiving myself!

148
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,520
Dad, look at it this way, you're getting angry, annoyed, etc.

149
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,239
What else would you do?

150
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,640
I don't know, girl! I don't know what I was going to do!

151
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,319
I don't know! I don't remember! Who was I, what was I, what was I doing!

152
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,239
No way!

153
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,319
First of all, I am a poet-spirited man!

154
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:56,439
Is he a poet?

155
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:59,520
''I am a walnut tree in Gülhane park''

156
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,760
''Neither you nor the police are aware of this.''

157
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,640
If I were not a poet, how would I remember Nazım Hikmet? Heh?

158
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,600
I don't even remember what I do yet.

159
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,760
Daddy, please don't do such things, take care of yourself!

160
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,319
Until yesterday, you didn't remember who we were.

161
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:20,079
Would you look at yourself now? Please! Poems, poems.

162
00:13:20,319 --> 00:13:24,680
Aah, you are the only person in this world who had Alzheimer's and recovered.

163
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,119
Think about this, I ask!

164
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,840
I got better, but what happened? No, what happened now, I knew, I learned, what happened?

165
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,439
If you had left me like that.

166
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,479
Look, please don't say that, dad, I really feel sorry for you.

167
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,079
Mr. Münir is not there anyway! What did you do to the cat?

168
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,760
Where is this cat?

169
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,800
Dad, there is no cat!

170
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,880
What do you mean, how can it not exist?

171
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,520
Let me die so I can be saved!

172
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,199
What kind of world is this, what kind of life is this?

173
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,720
Münir Bey is not there either! Let me die and be saved!

174
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
Daddy!

175
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:07,720
He lost consciousness.

176
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,560
Daddy! Father!

177
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,680
- He shut down, he shut down, his consciousness turned off. - Daddy!

178
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:24,840
Dad, daddy. Dad, are you okay?

179
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,960
You were already going to kill yourself.

180
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:44,560
Who knows how unhappy you were.

181
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,600
If only you had squeezed your head!

182
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,760
You couldn't do it, could you?

183
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,199
Because you were afraid.

184
00:14:56,439 --> 00:14:57,520
You were afraid of death.

185
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,640
(laugh)

186
00:14:59,319 --> 00:15:01,079
You coward!

187
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,399
You must also be afraid of being hungry! Ass!

188
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,399
That's why you went and became a clerk, right?

189
00:15:15,479 --> 00:15:17,399
But I'm not afraid!

190
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,840
Do you know why?

191
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,399
Because I am Agah Beyoğlu.

192
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,560
I have to leave immediately. I have a job.

193
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,520
Where to dad?

194
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,199
I'm going to do something I've never done before!

195
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,399
What is it?

196
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,680
I will live my life!

197
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,640
What will you do? How will you live your life?

198
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,880
I have two questions for you.

199
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,359
One! Where's your mother's car?

200
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,359
Two! Which donkey made me wear these!

201
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,760
Who are you? Who are you?

202
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,960
- Oh dad, it's so beautiful. - So sweet.

203
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,079
AGAIN

204
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:44,439
Father! Oh dad! Ugh!

205
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:46,359
Father! Wait!

206
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:49,800
- Oh Ertan, why don't you stop it? - I'm paying for it, Zuhal!

207
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,600
(laugh)

208
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:58,640
(nida)

209
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,000
(unintelligible speech)

210
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:35,720
(enthusiastic voices)

211
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,520
(enthusiastic voices)

212
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:07,399
(enthusiastic voices)

213
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:22,520
- Ahhh!

214
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:27,159
(unintelligible speech)

215
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,479
(unintelligible speech)

216
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,399
Brother, don't do it!

217
00:19:55,399 --> 00:19:59,920
(unintelligible speech)

218
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,640
Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh!

219
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,439
(unintelligible speech)

220
00:20:05,439 --> 00:20:07,720
Ahhh!

221
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,600
Officer! Officer! Officer!

222
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,119
- Are you okay, uncle!

223
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,600
I killed a man!

224
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,600
What do you say, uncle?

225
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:18,119
I killed so many people!

226
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,800
I say murderer! I'm a killer!

227
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,600
Chief, take a look, this says something.

228
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,119
Did something happen, uncle?

229
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,359
(Mumbling)

230
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,640
Well, you don't have a criminal record either, uncle.

231
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,199
But I'm just telling you, I hit that much, I say!

232
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,840
Why don't you believe me?

233
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,399
Okay uncle, okay, he will come now, you can tell him.

234
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,600
Who will come?

235
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,840
Come on, Mr. Prosecutor.

236
00:20:57,199 --> 00:20:57,840
You go out.

237
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,960
- Now you remember that you shot someone. -Yes.

238
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,680
But you don't know who you are, do you?

239
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,920
No, I don't remember.

240
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,800
Why did you shoot these people, do you remember that?

241
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,119
No, I don't remember that either.

242
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,640
Ah! I! I forgot something!

243
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,279
What?

244
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:23,359
Is there any head left?

245
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,800
Am the Alzheimer var.

246
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:27,119
That's why I don't remember.

247
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,520
- Alzheimer's? - Yes!

248
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,079
Oh my God!

249
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,640
Understood, uncle.

250
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,600
Well, but wait a minute! I remember their faces!

251
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,640
I remember where I hit!

252
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Even what did I tell them, what did they say to me...

253
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,439
I remember all of these.

254
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,560
For example, let me tell you this.

255
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,359
Well, for example, we are in a narrow street at night.

256
00:21:58,439 --> 00:21:59,600
For example, that's Beyoğlu for sure.

257
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,399
I guess it's one of the back streets of Istiklal Avenue or something.

258
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,800
Now I'm standing in the middle of the road, these are coming.

259
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,800
- How many people are these? - Three people.

260
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,279
- One street... Beyoğlu... Three people...

261
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,920
What happens next?

262
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:20,720
Oh! Cut out the shape, what the hell is this!

263
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,680
Tub type!

264
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,800
Are you mafia, son?

265
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:27,720
Shh, wait, he's saying something, look! What?

266
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,560
I say are you mafia?

267
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,840
This is crazy!

268
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,640
Are you high? Heh?

269
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,920
Are you looking for trouble at night? F*ck off!

270
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,720
Stop, stop! Open your face!

271
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,079
Come on, come on, walk, we'll go to Sıtkı's place!

272
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,239
Who did you say?

273
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,840
Whose place were they going to?

274
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,560
A man called Sıtkı. They said they were going to Sıtkı's place.

275
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,199
I guess he is one of them, he is also the mafia.

276
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:55,239
How do you know that these are mafia?

277
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,720
They said it themselves! You already know their type!

278
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,600
They wore their coats and jackets so darkly.

279
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,279
No, I was already very angry at that moment!

280
00:23:05,199 --> 00:23:06,600
And when someone says something to me!

281
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,800
I got really upset.

282
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,279
What is he saying?

283
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,199
A****** the fucking clown..

284
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,119
I said, "Are you a mafia, my son?"

285
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,199
Damn! We are mafia, what happens?

286
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,279
Good morning my baby! Here you go mafia.

287
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:42,399
This! This was it. I killed this!

288
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:45,600
There were two other people with him. I killed them too.

289
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,239
Leave that alone, did you hear this story from someone!

290
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,920
From whom will I hear it?

291
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,680
I'm telling you that I did it myself. Where do I come up with such things?

292
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,479
What did you shoot them with?

293
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,239
Well! But a gun!

294
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,079
Something like this?

295
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:06,720
Oh no! It's not like that, it has a magazine.

296
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,199
There was no sound from the gun.

297
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,079
So it was coming… It was such a very faint sound.

298
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,880
Of course! There is a silencer on the barrel, of course very little sound comes from it.

299
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,359
Do you know this woman?

300
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,600
No, I couldn't make it out. Who is this?

301
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:37,800
Are you the one who killed the dog?

302
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,119
Why should I kill the dog? Am I a sadist?

303
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,239
How can I kill animals, cats and dogs!

304
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,159
I tell you that I shot a human, neither a human nor a dog!

305
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,479
Why are you telling this story?

306
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:58,319
Well! I don't know, it just came to my mind for a moment. I said, I mean, what have I done?

307
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,920
I swear I was afraid of myself!

308
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,840
You are saying something like this...

309
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:08,479
Anyone who does what you say will stay in prison for life. Are you aware?

310
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,119
Yes! I don't know, so how do I know!

311
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:18,520
It just came to my mind, I said it, but I never thought about it.

312
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:23,600
For life... Well, of course, what would happen?

313
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,560
Dear prosecutor, his family has arrived. The man was sick. Alzheimer's

314
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,840
He had been missing since the evening... His daughter and son-in-law were looking for him.

315
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,680
What should we do?

316
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,079
Mr. Agah! You have Alzheimer's.

317
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:48,199
Yes.

318
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,600
In some of the stories you tell, I think they are all imaginary.

319
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:56,119
You are dreaming.

320
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,600
What can i say! God give healing.

321
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,640
- For God's sake, don't make me go crazy at night, look, I'm crazy, please don't do this at night. - I told you it wouldn't work,

322
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,439
- How many times have I said let's not return from Australia?

323
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,399
- So, are you sick of Australia now? - Well, I am sick of it.

324
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,359
- I took you by force, Ertan!

325
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,560
- I took him by force. - That's fine.

326
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,000
- Look what can I do, look at this situation!

327
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:36,159
-Am I the only one responsible?

328
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,600
Am I?

329
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,319
You would take care of me like a father, my son!

330
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,600
Of course I wanted to believe. And I wanted it so much.

331
00:27:00,199 --> 00:27:04,119
Ohh, I said, it was all a dream! I didn't kill anyone.

332
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,119
How people deceive themselves.

333
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,880
But even worse…

334
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:20,720
That night, while I was telling about those murders, it turns out I woke up a monster.

335
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,359
Sir, prosecutor!

336
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,199
Sitki!

337
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:16,439
How are you?

338
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,680
It's fine, thank you.

339
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,199
Now listen carefully!

340
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,439
I will give you a name, and there will be no creditors left between us.

341
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,479
We will close the entire account, is that understood?

342
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,159
Hey, you're going to name a name big enough to close the account, right, prosecutor?

343
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,960
Well, tell me!

344
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:32,800
We found the person who killed Ramiz.

345
00:28:33,439 --> 00:28:34,560
Which Ramiz?

346
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:35,880
Sence?

347
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,000
Hikmet brother is not Nevra. Someone else. A guy we don't know at all.

348
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,800
I even sent you the video now.

349
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:51,760
The guy gives such details, that's for sure.

350
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,840
So, what should I do now, well, if you want, I can finish the job immediately, let me handle it tonight.

351
00:28:57,119 --> 00:28:58,920
Well, because his address is known.

352
00:28:59,439 --> 00:29:00,760
No, just stop!

353
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,560
Let me first take a look at the video you sent.

354
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,279
Brother! If you don't mind, let me ask you something.

355
00:29:10,439 --> 00:29:13,600
- Is Destiny really alive?

356
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,640
We finally found your brother's killer.

357
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Only Destiny, the man says I have Alzheimer's...

358
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,600
That's why I remember only this much.

359
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,600
The prosecutor told Sıtkı that he was a really sick man.

360
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,720
So the head is gone.

361
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:39,239
That's why it's not worth it, bro.

362
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:41,000
Don't get involved.

363
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,600
Let's handle this here and get it over with.

364
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:49,640
You have already been patient in the hands of the infidel for 30 years...

365
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:58,680
Well, now…. Don't get up and come for this... isn't it?

366
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,439
Someone spreads a news story and the nation becomes aware of it….

367
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:08,600
Do not open old notebooks out of the blue.

368
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,880
Now everyone knows you are dead...

369
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm sending you the video.

370
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,279
Well, officer, my son...

371
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,279
I shoot them, they die, I feel like I'm reborn!

372
00:30:42,239 --> 00:30:47,680
I mean, while they are writhing in pain on the ground, I feel like laughing.

373
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,560
It's not possible! But it is!

374
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,720
Well, officer, my son...

375
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:07,720
I shoot them, they die, I feel like I'm reborn!

376
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:14,199
I mean, while they are writhing in pain on the ground, I feel like laughing.

377
00:31:17,199 --> 00:31:22,640
I shoot them, they die, I feel like I'm reborn!

378
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,079
I mean, while they are writhing in pain on the ground, I feel like laughing.

379
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:20,600
(unintelligible speech)

380
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,800
(unintelligible speech)

381
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,239
Look, let's agree from the beginning. Okay, your father is starting to get better, he's starting to get better.

382
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:27,520
Okay, we can hire a woman and that's it.

383
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,239
Please let's be in Sydney before New Year's Eve..

384
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:33,720
We postponed all our work thinking that we would come, it can't happen like that.

385
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,680
I don't want to be late any longer.

386
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,079
Otherwise, let me know my conference settings here.

387
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:40,079
There are already many offers from Istanbul.

388
00:35:40,399 --> 00:35:43,479
Oh Ertan, don't you even think about me?

389
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,159
As your husband, of course I think so.

390
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:50,600
But I mean, as your manager, I have to think about work, too, my love.

391
00:35:59,439 --> 00:36:02,960
Ms. Safiye? Where are you?

392
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:06,199
Come on, it's food time.

393
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,399
It's breakfast time.

394
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,319
Ms. Safiye?

395
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,520
Come on, eat your food...

396
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:18,319
Let's call Münir Bey. Münir Bey is missing.

397
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:20,880
Heh !

398
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,520
Ms. Safiye!

399
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,600
Heh!

400
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,720
Heehhh! Are you here!

401
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,960
I said, this too has disappeared, like Mr. Münir, yes.

402
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,600
Allah bless! Come.

403
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,800
Baba!

404
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,840
What's up, girl? I am giving food to Ms. Safiye.

405
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,680
Okay, come on, we will have breakfast, you will take your medicine.

406
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,560
Okay okay. Okay I am coming.

407
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,239
Ms. Safiye!

408
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:03,640
Ms. Safiye!

409
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:34,199
Oh, you finally came out! Grandpa, how are you?

410
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,760
How can I be, Deva, I'm not well.

411
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,199
You look very good. You are like a monster!

412
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:41,479
It's because of the tool, that's why the tool makes it look defective.

413
00:37:41,479 --> 00:37:42,760
(LAUGH)

414
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,079
Mom! And can you send me some more money?

415
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:47,880
Deva ..

416
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,760
Dear Deva, we have just sent money, what kind of money is this, for no reason!

417
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,560
Dad, Beyoğlu has changed a lot, hasn't it? Look at this situation!

418
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,600
Ertan!

419
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:01,800
Ertan, can you take a look? Ertan!

420
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,199
Deva wants money.

421
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm a cure, I called and called but he didn't answer.

422
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,920
I just sent you money, son. I sent new money.

423
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,840
There is no one left in Beyoğlu to change.

424
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,960
Look at this situation!

425
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,680
It seems like people are not walking, they are crushing each other.

426
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,199
Beyoğlu is finished.

427
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,960
Agah Beyoğlu is also finished.

428
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,359
(korna session)

429
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,159
Hih! Car!

430
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,760
How many days has he been there, no one cares!

431
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,479
Are you Alzheimer's or me?

432
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:15,079
A huge car, how can one forget?

433
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,920
Baba!

434
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:20,960
Baba!

435
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:30,239
Please Attention!.. Dear passengers…

436
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,000
For your safety, do not cross the yellow line on the platforms!

437
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,560
(english announcement)

438
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,359
(unintelligible speech)

439
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,680
Hello.

440
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,840
- Hello. - Hello.

441
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,279
Excuse me, what is this card?

442
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:17,000
This thing is an elderly card. Free. The metro is free.

443
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,640
- May I look? -Of course.

444
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,399
Free senior card.

445
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,319
Well, we are old now.

446
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,600
(laugh)

447
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,479
Yes.

448
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:32,439
I fell asleep and woke up! Everything has changed!

449
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,760
The world has changed.

450
00:40:34,279 --> 00:40:36,760
Yes, it is, it is a completely different country.

451
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:37,800
Yaa!

452
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,560
I've been out for a long time...

453
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:41,960
Huh!

454
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,439
So I say, where is that old Istanbul!

455
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,199
Right, where!

456
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,159
But I don't remember.

457
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,399
Alzheimer's was fixed.

458
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,079
I take medicine.

459
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,279
I guess it sounds good, so…

460
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,399
For example, I remembered something.

461
00:41:02,439 --> 00:41:05,359
I remembered where I parked the car, I'm going to pick it up now.

462
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:07,439
- Beautiful, beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful. - Oh!

463
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,359
I remember their phone numbers.

464
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,840
What more do you want?

465
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:12,439
I didn't remember before.

466
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,600
But I don't remember myself, bro.

467
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,960
Who was I, what kind of person was I? I have no idea.

468
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,239
My daughter tells me.

469
00:41:25,279 --> 00:41:28,880
Here, you were like this, you were like that, you did this, you did that.

470
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:31,560
I was amazed!

471
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:34,800
What can I do like that! Exit!

472
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:38,960
Then I got angry at people, I mean.

473
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,960
Then I got so nervous that, well, I started shooting them all, one by one.

474
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,640
In a dream, I guess.

475
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,119
It's a subconscious thing.

476
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,079
So, you see, it's gone too, it's gone.

477
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,720
There is nothing left like reasoning or anything.

478
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,960
But, I'm trying to remember this.

479
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:10,319
What kind of person was I, what did I want in life, what did I do?

480
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,840
If I understand him.

481
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,600
Can a person live without remembering himself, brother! Can such a thing happen?

482
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,399
That's why I'm taking medications.

483
00:42:23,279 --> 00:42:29,600
But I don't know, maybe that's it. This much.

484
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:35,600
As Yunus Emre says: "There is a self within me."

485
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,920
Maybe there is no other Agah inside.

486
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:48,880
Was!

487
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:51,520
How would you know?

488
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,079
There is, there is, trust me.

489
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:59,079
There is another Agah inside you.

490
00:42:59,239 --> 00:43:00,000
(laugh)

491
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,880
That's why I came to you.

492
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,560
How?

493
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,600
I said, if he is on this medicine, he will come to his senses!

494
00:43:12,399 --> 00:43:14,880
Let me kill your family first.

495
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,640
What are you saying? Is he crazy or what, go ahead.

496
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,279
- Listen to me, listen to me for a minute. - What am I going to listen to, don't talk nonsense, go away.

497
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:24,800
- Listen, listen to me. - Oh, go ahead.

498
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:28,640
- Look! Let me tell you what will happen. - Oh God, get away from me.

499
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,560
Go! What's it to you? Whatever happens, what does it matter to you? Go ahead.

500
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,399
Whoever is around you,

501
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,000
Everyone you love will die one by one.

502
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,239
You will die last.

503
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:42,119
Are you sick or what, go away!

504
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,600
You know, you say, who am I?

505
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:47,399
You know those murders you told the police about?

506
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:50,880
You are the man who killed those people.

507
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,399
Don't you dare go to the police!

508
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:57,359
They let you in. Your family stays outside.

509
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,960
I will kill them again, but it would be a pity if you couldn't see them.

510
00:44:02,479 --> 00:44:06,720
How do you know that I went to the police and what I told them? Who are you?

511
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,079
I am the man who will punish you, Agah Effendi.

512
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,159
What's the punishment? I didn't kill anyone, it was all a dream.

513
00:44:14,399 --> 00:44:16,000
The prosecutor said so anyway!

514
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:20,600
Your punishment starts from now on. You will suffer, there is no solution!

515
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,880
What punishment, what did I do?

516
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,800
That daughter, son-in-law, grandchild, all of you...

517
00:44:27,279 --> 00:44:29,479
I will bury it in the ground in such a way...

518
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,159
Even if the whole world comes, they won't be able to find it.

519
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:34,239
From where? I didn't do anything!

520
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:36,760
You killed my brother.

521
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,199
What's the point, why should I kill your brother?

522
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:41,079
I don't know. You will remember.

523
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,359
What will I remember?

524
00:44:43,439 --> 00:44:46,600
Your treatment is going a little slow, let me speed it up.

525
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,880
- You'll remember this, right! - What is this?

526
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:57,159
This is the biggest crime you've ever committed!

527
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:01,520
Personal…

528
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,560
You made this my brother's destiny, Agah Effendi.

529
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,000
But now, do you know what is written on your forehead?

530
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,560
Kader.

531
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,000
Is it?

532
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:18,880
Sorry uncle!

533
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:24,520
Dur!

534
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,279
What will I remember!

535
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,199
What does it matter?

536
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,119
It's a relationship!

537
00:45:38,479 --> 00:45:39,000
It's a relationship!

538
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,319
What will I remember!

539
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,920
What will I remember!
