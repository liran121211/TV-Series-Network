1
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,719
(children's voices)

2
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,320
Actually, sometimes I can't understand it at all, I wonder how a person can...

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,039
Does he think about people he doesn't know more than himself?

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,440
Teacher, you would give your photo.

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,760
After all, a person doesn't know anything other than himself so he can think about others.

6
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,119
If he doesn't have it, it's his own trouble, his own pain, his own pleasure.

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,960
Sorry, can we hurry? I have to go back to school.

8
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:52,320
Come on, if you didn't know, his parents, his children, his wife.

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,760
But someone else whose name he doesn't even know yet

10
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,480
or the one who lives thousands of kilometers away from himself.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,079
Even if one lives to the fullest, why does one think about those who are not like him?

12
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,960
Why does he value someone he doesn't even know? - What are you doing with the child?

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,079
What is it to him? Isn't it? What's wrong with you?

14
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,039
Baby goat!

15
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:22,960
Mary! Come on, girl, go to bed.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,159
But some of them are. It's getting weird.

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,119
He says that no matter how many people there are in this world...

18
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,159
All of their problems are mine.

19
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,800
Even if he knows, no one thinks about him.

20
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:41,360
Yet he still stubbornly thinks about it all.

21
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:43,719
Then what happens?

22
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,320
(incomprehensible speech)

23
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,400
One night, someone he doesn't know knocks on his door and pulls the trigger.

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,280
However, in most murders in this world, the killer knows the victim personally, right?

25
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,199
But, when a person starts to think about people he has never met...

26
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,000
The murderer is someone he doesn't even know.

27
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,880
They don't say it's an unknown perpetrator for nothing.

28
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,199
Because the victim does not know the killer.

29
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,519
If you say the murderer, he doesn't know the victim either.

30
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,800
Here you go, another unknown

31
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,800
(children's voices)

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,239
If you load the big ship with so much uncertainty, where else will it go?

33
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,880
You, me, all of us can only go to the bottom of the unknown.

34
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,400
Good evening.

35
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,039
Shh

36
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,039
Come on, thank you.

37
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,360
I think we found it!

38
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,800
Who's this?

39
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,400
(Do not breathe)

40
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,440
There are so many disasters in this life...

41
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,800
You never know how you will react until it happens to you.

42
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,880
Ms. Safiye!

43
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,760
Guys!

44
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,400
For example, a man comes across and...

45
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,280
If he said he would kill your whole family first and then you...

46
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,679
Whatever you do? Would you go to the police?

47
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:17,199
Or do you act like something like this never happened and try to forget it?

48
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:24,320
Well... if someone killed your cat

49
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,800
what do you do then?

50
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,280
I remembered something.

51
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,360
No matter how much it hurt me at that moment, revenge was obviously not enough...

52
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:39,039
On top of that, I wanted to start a war.

53
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,480
So just when I need it,

54
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,440
I remembered that I had a huge arsenal.

55
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,440
Mackerel street. Mebrure Apartment. At number 8.

56
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,640
Namaste. How can I help?

57
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,319
Who are you? What are you doing here? I had my things?

58
00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:32,680
What did you have?

59
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,760
I say it's me...

60
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,880
How dare they sell my house! So where are my guns?

61
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,399
Mr. Agah! Hello.

62
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,600
Hello, I didn't recognize you.

63
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,079
Can we talk a little?

64
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:53,920
Reason?

65
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,399
Is he following me?

66
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,319
Yes.

67
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,199
Which incompetent person took this photo?

68
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,960
- Its horizon line is crooked! Is it possible to frame like this? - Mr. Agah!

69
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,239
Heh.

70
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,039
Don't you know this person now?

71
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:14,560
No I do not know! I don't know you either!

72
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:18,640
I told you. My name is Meryem, I am a lawyer.

73
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,800
Are you the lawyer for this?

74
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,319
- Mr. Agah... - Uhh..

75
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,840
Very simple. We are after this man. He is after you too.

76
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:31,239
Now when we learned this, we did some research on you.

77
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,640
Then we learned that you went and gave a statement to the police.

78
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,079
Well, how do you know these?

79
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,960
Where did you hear that? No, I went to the police, what did I say?

80
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:40,119
It's not important.

81
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,199
- We want to help you. - Uhh..

82
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,399
But first you need to tell us the truth.

83
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:46,399
Huh?

84
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,279
- Mr. Agah! - Huh?

85
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:53,840
Do you really not remember who the people you killed were?

86
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,800
I don't remember, my son, I don't remember! I have Alzheimer's too.

87
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,479
I said this too

88
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,880
I said I have Alzheimer's disease and I don't remember, but he didn't believe me.

89
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,359
He also threatened me, you bastard!

90
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,520
No, he killed my daughter, or my family.

91
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,439
He went and killed my cat, that bastard. His unscrupulous son is unscrupulous!

92
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,439
So that's why he came out.

93
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,439
Why?

94
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,159
To take revenge on you.

95
00:10:17,239 --> 00:10:18,119
What revenge?

96
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,000
Maybe to silence.

97
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,199
- Mr. Agah? - Huh?

98
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,760
Did you leave that confession unfinished on purpose?

99
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,760
To blackmail?

100
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,439
Blackmailing who?

101
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,880
To these people.

102
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,239
Who are they? I don't know them.

103
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,159
Really? Let me tell you this, Mr. Agah.

104
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,399
These men will not leave you behind.

105
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:59,239
Until yesterday, no one knew this man's face.

106
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:01,159
No one knew whether he was dead or alive.

107
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,880
But then he risked everything. It emerged thirty years later.

108
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:06,199
I wonder why?

109
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
What should I know?

110
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,359
Could it be because you went and gave a statement to the police?

111
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:13,520
Otherwise, why would he come here and chase you?

112
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,479
Maybe you're not that innocent after all. Huh?

113
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,079
But maybe, one day, you decide to remember. You can call me.

114
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,560
Maybe we can help you too.

115
00:11:31,479 --> 00:11:33,359
Can I have them now?

116
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,039
Of course you can have it. Now, my lady, if I may ask...

117
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:39,960
Can you tell me who they are and what they are?

118
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:43,840
I think you know who they are better than I do.

119
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,920
Because a person knows the person he betrayed.

120
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,840
Mr. Agah! Can I have it please?

121
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,720
Mr. Agah! Mr. Agah, Mr. Agah, what are you doing?

122
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,560
Aah! Agah bey!

123
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,800
Meryem, let it go, let it go.

124
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,760
(breath)

125
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,159
(breath)

126
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:03,439
The cat is also thirsty.

127
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,800
Oh my darling cat.

128
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:40,760
What happened to you?

129
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:44,479
When did you leave me and go away?

130
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,840
Look, this is Ms. Safiye.

131
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,319
I always said, take me to Mr. Münir, take me to Mr. Münir, my child brought me.

132
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,439
You will now sleep side by side.

133
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,079
Take care of each other, okay?

134
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,760
I couldn't look at you, forgive me.

135
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,399
But you, take care of each other.

136
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:36,079
Bu ne ya?

137
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,560
What's this?

138
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Did you kill my cat?

139
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,560
What cat bro? What are you talking about?

140
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,399
Get in.

141
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,840
- Isn't your name Fahri? - Yes.

142
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,319
Are you the night watchman here? Really?

143
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,680
So I am.

144
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:01,640
What?

145
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,439
Put that gun down.

146
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
The guy says to me, you killed my brother.

147
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:08,039
I say I didn't do it, he says you did.

148
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:09,960
I say I don't remember, he says remember.

149
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,600
Then someone else comes and says you betrayed them.

150
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,079
Who are you that I should betray you? Who are you?

151
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,960
Look brother, tell me how you found me and I will answer your questions.

152
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,680
I found it however I found it. What's it to you?

153
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,439
You killed my cat? My cat!

154
00:17:31,239 --> 00:17:33,359
Well, what can you do, it's destiny.

155
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:36,039
What the hell fate? You hanged my cat.

156
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:37,680
That's okay. Destiny!

157
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,039
Are you kidding me? Huh?

158
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,760
Bu ne ya?

159
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:04,159
Our guests would come here. While I was waiting for them, I saw that Agah had arrived.

160
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:11,600
He wants you.

161
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,319
Well done Agah.

162
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,640
This is what the adversary will be like. Well, I didn't expect it from you at all.

163
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,880
You know a lot about these things.

164
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,119
But I guess you know my name by now.

165
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:37,800
"Fate" is now written on your forehead.

166
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,319
That's mine.

167
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:47,319
You leave him alone and answer me. You killed my cat, didn't you?

168
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,079
Once again, I will bring this to your nose, this is a...

169
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,439
But first, you will leave my family behind...

170
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,039
Or is this Fahri standing in front of me?

171
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,960
Don't tire yourself out, Agah. Don't bother trying to get Fahri to talk.

172
00:19:05,239 --> 00:19:09,279
He wouldn't say a word if you ripped his liver out. Shoot Fahri directly!

173
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:14,520
Either hit your forehead from the roof or go back home.

174
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,520
Look at me!

175
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,039
He hung up. Take it.

176
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:22,119
What did he say?

177
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:27,319
What kind of person are you! What kind of insidious conversations are these?

178
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,159
He is an enemy, his heart has been ripped out, what are you doing?

179
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:34,359
Is it that easy to take a life? This is human, human. Life!

180
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,199
First of all, a man first thinks about what comes out of his mouth.

181
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,840
He thinks first, then speaks.

182
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,800
But whether this is Destiny or what, the guy has a habit of saying the first thing that comes to his mind.

183
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:49,920
What did he say?

184
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:54,920
What will he say, Mr. Fahri, my brother, he said this.

185
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,720
Ahh! is it okay now? So is this it? Shoot and shoot.

186
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,560
Isn't it a shame?

187
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:14,119
Who knows, you have spouses, friends and loved ones. Heh, isn't it a shame?

188
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,079
Moreover, you obviously have a law. Who knows how many years he's known you?

189
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,279
But no, just pull and shoot. Is this it?

190
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Bad manners. He doesn't know the manners of talking on the phone anyway.

191
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,560
Don't interrupt someone like that while the other person is talking.

192
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,960
( laugh )

193
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,079
How dare you grin!

194
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,279
- Cure! - What happened to Deva?

195
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:44,960
First the cat, then Deva!

196
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,479
Deva!

197
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,600
First, you put my foot in a shoe. You're making me rush.

198
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:05,560
I forget later.

199
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,079
I'll get right to the point!

200
00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:23,720
I'm an alcoholic!

201
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:30,479
I am a woman who has never been able to hold down any job she has ever worked for.

202
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,680
I am a child with a father with Alzheimer's and fifty problems.

203
00:21:37,439 --> 00:21:41,800
I am a wife who constantly fights with her husband!

204
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,319
I am all of these!

205
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:50,399
Or rather, I was! Until it comes back to life!

206
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,520
So what brought me back to life?

207
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,800
Of course ''Dog Killer''!

208
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:15,560
Come on! Come on! Pick up that phone!

209
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,000
Why did I survive? Why did I survive?

210
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,479
Why did I survive?

211
00:22:26,399 --> 00:22:28,640
Here's to writing this.

212
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,600
(enthusiastic voices)

213
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,720
Oh no, father, where is this coming from?

214
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,680
No, something happened. Something happened to television.

215
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,760
So I decided to look at the antenna, so I went up to the roof for two minutes.

216
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,079
Well, we have cable broadcasting, daddy, there is no antenna up there.

217
00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:35,439
No! Well, it doesn't exist, I couldn't find it either.

218
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,920
It doesn't exist! What can I say? Please call this Deva so I can hear the child's voice.

219
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,079
Oh daddy, evening, evening...

220
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,319
So I don't understand why you want Deva, I will call.

221
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,079
I felt like hearing the boy's voice, call me, let's talk to the boy.

222
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:52,159
See, he felt it too.

223
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:55,600
What did I feel? What happened, did something happen to Deva?

224
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,479
Well, okay, don't panic, we called but couldn't reach you...

225
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,319
- Zuhal is talking about him, so we couldn't reach him. - Well, what else?

226
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:09,720
Well, he calls us, he is now up in the mountains, in the hills, the phone has no reception, I know that.

227
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,439
How comfortable are you, Ertan! How comfortable you are.

228
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,039
- No, daddy, don't worry. - Hey dad, there is nothing to worry about.

229
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,159
What do you mean, there is nothing to worry about? Don't people care about their children?

230
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,239
- Is this how we raised you? - Yes.

231
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:21,439
What, how yes?

232
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,279
Dad, for God's sake, let me know what I will tell you from now on.

233
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:28,319
Also, how can you sell number 8 below without asking me?

234
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,039
You also sold it to gymnasts. They are stamping on people's heads.

235
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,720
Can a house be sold to a gymnast?

236
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,439
They're not gymnasts, dad. That's the yoga center.

237
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,159
Anyway, one has to ask.

238
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,039
I say, "Dad, how can I ask you? You were sick."

239
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:47,119
They declared me as a compulsory guardian, and I dealt with a thousand tons of work.

240
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:50,920
No court, no committee report, I don't know what...

241
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,720
Dad, I paid for that nursing home for four and a half years.

242
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,880
- Do you know how expensive it is? - Huh!

243
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,600
I didn't know what to do, so I had to sell the flat.

244
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,800
You did well.

245
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:04,439
Okay okay okay. Could you calm down a little? OK, calm down.

246
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,760
Why didn't you take me with you?

247
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,680
A person takes care of his father at home. That's all I got sick.

248
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,319
It wouldn't cost that much.

249
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,119
I can't believe it, can you hear what he's saying?

250
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,880
Does he hear what, wait a minute, who didn't want me at home?

251
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,920
Are you? Is this? Heh? Which of you didn't want it?

252
00:25:19,199 --> 00:25:21,399
What are you shouting about, the girl will wake up?

253
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,760
Aahh!...Ya Deva sen geldin mi ya?

254
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:27,560
Son, why don't you answer the phone, we are scared to death.

255
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,600
Deva, son, when did you come?

256
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,399
It's been an hour since we arrived. I knocked on the door, but no one opened it.

257
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,720
An hour?

258
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,640
Dad, you were out for two minutes.

259
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,199
You left him alone and gave keys to everyone?

260
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,920
Heh! Is this a passing inn?

261
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:45,760
You said, "I'm going to go crazy, father, child, I'm curious, I'm curious."

262
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,920
The boy appeared in front of you, is this your problem now?

263
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,600
Dude, call and ask, we're dying of curiosity!

264
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,880
Ok. I will ask the real question.

265
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,760
Look at me, where is it? Is there someone? Is there a girl somewhere?

266
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:05,720
(stretch)

267
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:19,159
Hello! I'm Fatoş.

268
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,720
We are married!

269
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:29,199
That's why you wanted money from me?

270
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,359
Well, getting married is not easy, mom.

271
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,520
Heh! Here you go, light it up!

272
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,520
What will we say to Fahri's wife? The woman will be ruined.

273
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,479
I'll talk..

274
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:52,079
What do you say?

275
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:56,399
I'll say don't involve the police, we'll handle it.

276
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,199
So, won't the woman want to see her husband one last time?

277
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:05,239
Aren't they married? Has he seen as much as he can see?

278
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:10,479
Well, won't this man have a tombstone?

279
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,520
Hikmet, green came.

280
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:21,159
Come, come, come, come...come. Okay whoop!

281
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:30,520
You haven't changed at all, Destiny?

282
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,279
Haven't I changed? If you say this too, Hikmet.

283
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,079
Wisdom!

284
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,640
Wisdom! If I hadn't changed. Just to keep my brother's blood on the ground...

285
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,600
Will I come all the way from here to take revenge? If only in the past...

286
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,279
He wouldn't care at all.

287
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:53,560
Yes.

288
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,439
What would I always say?

289
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,640
Fatality.

290
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:01,319
I'd say it's fate, right?

291
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:11,039
But when a person gets older, he becomes different. So, out of the blue, past memories come to mind.

292
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:31,319
Wisdom! Tell me, what is revenge?

293
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:38,680
You will only feel it, your mind will be on yesterday, and you will want to go and take revenge.

294
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,960
What a great weakness, isn't it, Hikmet?

295
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,920
I am no longer the old Kader you know.

296
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:56,840
I am a weak man. Weak.

297
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,520
If I weren't weak, would I try so hard for my brother?

298
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:07,439
If my conscience didn't hurt, would I go and slaughter that cat?

299
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,159
If I were not a sensitive man, I would go and kill everyone's children...

300
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Why should I try to kill?

301
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,520
Wisdom! (mumbling prayer)

302
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:34,239
- Alhamdulillah.. - I know.

303
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,079
Mary! Are you serious?

304
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,239
- Is he really here? - Yes.

305
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,479
Just relax.

306
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:20,520
Look, we have been patient and waited all these years.

307
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,479
That's why we won't rush now and make the wrong decision.

308
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:38,239
Otherwise, I am in such a situation...

309
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,000
When I saw the photos of the man...

310
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,560
I'm trying very hard not to go and grab his throat.

311
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,920
But we won't do that now. Is it ok?

312
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,600
ok

313
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,680
There is something we need to be sure about now.

314
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,640
What is it?

315
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,840
Mom! Don't do this, what would happen?

316
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:47,640
Look, you came all this way, take a look at this photo, let's go home.

317
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:50,760
No.

318
00:31:51,199 --> 00:31:52,960
Come on mom, open your eyes.

319
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:02,960
I mean, if there was another way, would I ever make you suffer this torment?

320
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,359
But not. No, there is no other way.

321
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,520
You're the only one who saw this man.

322
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,840
Didn't you say that he always comes into my dreams?

323
00:32:14,439 --> 00:32:17,880
I see the face of this guy called Kader. Please..

324
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,800
What happens if I can't? I won't be able to.

325
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:29,359
Mom! My mother! Look, we need to be sure. Heh?

326
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,359
Did this man come to our house?

327
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,279
What happens?

328
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,960
This man is the only one, he didn't take my father away, mom.

329
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,520
Well, he didn't just take her away.

330
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,159
Do you know how many people are like you?

331
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:52,640
What happened to my child, what happened to my brother...

332
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,520
They have been crying bitterly for thirty years asking what happened to my husband. Mother, what if I become a sacrifice?

333
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,119
Ahh.

334
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:42,479
Yes.

335
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,279
Yes.

336
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,159
Daddy, where are we going to run away at this hour?

337
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:59,359
There's no need to run away, girl, there's no running away, where did running come from?

338
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:02,359
Daddy, wait a minute, can you stop? It's father time.

339
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:04,760
- Daddy, wait a minute, my dear. - Put your paws down, girl.

340
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,880
Dad, where are we going to go at this hour, for God's sake?

341
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,239
To where? Where are we going at this hour?

342
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,159
Why are you walking around the house in your underwear?

343
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:16,039
Go put some clothes on. We'll find a place to go, there are lots of hotels.

344
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,600
Should we call the doctor?

345
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,279
Daddy, please sit down and let's talk.

346
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,479
Just so you know, I don't do anything without taking my daughter and grandchild on vacation.

347
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,640
It is not clear how much of my life is left here, while I am ready...

348
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,279
Thank you dad, please don't say that.

349
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:33,479
- You come with me. - Heh!

350
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,359
- Come on, come on, come on, come on - Should I call an ambulance?

351
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:37,239
Should we call an ambulance? Ambulance ambulance.

352
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,600
Should we call an ambulance? Ambulance ambulance.

353
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,039
- Fatos! Remedy! Let's call an ambulance, he's not well. - Come on. My daughter.

354
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,960
Now I'm taking this medicine, girl, I'm reborn.

355
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,279
God gave me a second chance, a second life.

356
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,520
While you were there shouting at each other in the evening, I was looking at the sky like this.

357
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,119
Suddenly a falling star fell. So I made a wish.

358
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:11,119
I said, Agah, don't make the mistakes you made in your old life again. Don't do it!

359
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,079
Then you came to my mind, your childhood.

360
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,640
When you were a child, you always cried, Dad, why don't you take us on vacation?

361
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:24,119
Take us on vacation. I said that the new Agah would take his daughter on vacation.

362
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,880
The old Agah did not release it, the new one will.

363
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:34,159
No matter what he does, he doesn't stop even for a second, finds his way, takes his daughter on vacation.

364
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,600
He made his daughter cry once, he will never make her cry again.

365
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:58,159
Get ready, we are going on vacation.

366
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,479
( laugh )

367
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
To where ?

368
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,520
Daddy, where did you find that?

369
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:22,479
My daughter, the car has been renewed, new car, new toy, new decoration, how?

370
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,439
In your words, isn't it cool?

371
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:30,399
- But the car is like a beast! - Oh, that's okay, but still go slow.

372
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,039
Don't regret letting me sit behind the wheel.

373
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,920
Grandpa, I'm looking at the mirrors. If you want to get some sleep.

374
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:45,319
What am I going to sleep, you sleep. Oh, don't sleep, don't sleep!

375
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,039
- Daddy! - Heh?

376
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,079
- I'm looking at the photos. - Heh?

377
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:51,960
I think I found a great hotel heh, you will love it.

378
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,680
My daughter, our goal is to be together as a family. Isn't it? Look how beautiful.

379
00:37:57,479 --> 00:38:00,800
It's like he was born into Deva. My lion is up and coming.

380
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,920
Actually, I wasn't going to tell you, but something happened and that's why we came.

381
00:38:24,439 --> 00:38:25,239
(incomprehensible speech)

382
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:28,560
- Destiny. - Sir.

383
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:32,640
Sıtkı is the friend I told you about. He gave us the news.

384
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:37,720
- Heh, no no no. - It's a great honor for me.

385
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,199
Thank you brother, thank you Sıtkı.

386
00:38:50,399 --> 00:38:51,560
Was it worth it?

387
00:38:52,479 --> 00:38:53,399
What bro?

388
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,880
How much did you sell this face for?

389
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:58,119
What to sell bro?

390
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:00,159
Who did you sell me to, Sıtkı?

391
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,359
There is something wrong, brother Kader, I didn't do anything.

392
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,199
Your man doesn't say that, but Sıtkı. You put Destiny up for auction.

393
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:08,920
Which man am I?

394
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:17,920
Damn son of a *****.

395
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:28,720
Why did you shoot the man, my son? Heh! How will we find out now who he sold the photos to?

396
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,359
Hikmet, don't be angry, don't be angry. That's how these kids are.

397
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:37,199
My son, come and see. Come.

398
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:51,000
Aaahh..

399
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,640
That's what this mafia is like.

400
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,720
He is either stupid or a fraud.

401
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:45,199
That's why I've always been against it.

402
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,239
This shit called mafia.

403
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,720
How? Did a thief break into the house?

404
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:57,119
I don't know, I guess.

405
00:40:59,439 --> 00:41:03,119
We were outside, we came back home, they broke the door.

406
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,840
Well, they didn't take anything, but they turned the house upside down.

407
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,680
They also wrote something on the living room wall.

408
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:10,800
What did they write?

409
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,720
They were drunk or something, probably high or something.

410
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,520
Tell me, son, what did they write?

411
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,640
That was nonsense!

412
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,800
My son, tell me what they wrote?

413
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,840
Destiny cannot be prevented.

414
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:24,920
God God!

415
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,359
Maybe they were just children... Of course, Fatoş got quite angry.

416
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,279
He said, "I can't stay in this house anymore."

417
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:38,039
You know, you were always saying, come and see your grandfather...

418
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:39,760
So we went out and here we are.

419
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:45,840
Oh my baby, oh my dear Deva, you got it right, I will be a paragliding instructor...

420
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,279
I don't know what will happen, there was shit on the paraglider.

421
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,920
Mommy, what does it matter now? I'm telling you someone broke into the house.

422
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,119
Daddy! Okay, I've done my job, we can go.

423
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,720
Before you leave, son, do this job.

424
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,119
What about dad, you took us out in such a hurry, I mean, should I pee my pants?

425
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,720
Oh Ertan!
