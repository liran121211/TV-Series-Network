Aaron himself is a suspect, again. The case rehashes the still unsolved murder of Aaron's best friend Patrick Hayes, whose father is questioned, as well as Thorsen's buddies in Paris, since the police suspect the murders are connected. Thorsen's mother was in Paris when Patrick was murdered, for a sexual fling with a French footballer. The French chief investigator Olivier Marceille is criticized for ignoring potential suspects for the Hayes murder, notably the finance minister's son. The police find Thorsen's friend Rowan Clausen committed both murders, abusing his role as instigator for friend activities, to create opportunities to smuggle drugs on Thorsen's private plane. Rowan killed Hayes for discovering and threatening to out his smuggling operation, and then Mackey for figuring out he was behind the first murder.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "18332726", "rating": 4.9, "votes": 2111, "number_of_episodes": 144}
