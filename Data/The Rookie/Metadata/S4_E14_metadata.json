Officer Chen and Sergeant Bradford hunt for a perpetrator on a citywide crime spree.", "*German, ever-excited 'Rainman' Skip Tracer Randy turned bounty-hunter and arrives at the station to meet Nolan and Harper about his first bounty: notorious society madam Ivy Flynn, whom he sets out to capture, teaming up with them as soon as he learns police doesn't share in the bounty. She gets away during their sting operation, while rival bounty hunter Alicia Kaufman, Randy's rudely non-reciprocal lover, was about to apprehend Flynn, sparking arguments between the four.

At a hotel, they ambush and arrest Flynn but thugs attack them, Kaufman snatches away fleeing Flynn for the bounty, but Nolan saves them when ambushed in the parking garage and learns a rivalry twist in his own living-room.
