Deducing that the targets are main freeways, Clarke and Nolan take one, stopping one of the trucks and narrowly sideswipe it just before a freeway bridge. Grey and FBI agent Garza mount an FBI chopper to get an overview from there, while Bradford and Chen and cavalcades of LAPD and FBI manage to stop the remaining vans- only one still detonates, killing 17 people. At the LA CIA station, its chief, Bill August, tells Garza and Grey he can't help with the theory of rogue CIA agents, only promises to look into the classified file on Gurin, but also warns his men. Bradford and Nolan meet Tim's former associate Kate Hill, now in the CIA, who quickly shut them down, but the LAPD turns the tables. Hill reveals that \"Enervo\" was a black Ops plan to destabilize foreign cities, headed by August and the lead perpetrator being Gurin, code for Ilya Shokorov. Clarke and Zeke identify a Russian chocolate bar Gurin had. She meets and fights him near the aquarium till Nolan arrives. They track Shokorov into the aquarium, where he explains his acts of terrorism are revenge for August deserting his crew and leaving them for dead. August's men arrive and flee outside, shooting as the LAPD and FBI arrive to arrest them.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "18555908", "rating": 6.1, "votes": 1555, "number_of_episodes": 144}
