Bradford plays to win, even bribing a dispatcher to get the best calls, which worries Chen, but clearly still fights crime justly and efficiently. Every rookie ends up forfeiting the day off prize, out of growing loyalty. West dives headfirst into the competition to prove himself while Nolan and Bishop, who is refusing to play at all, find themselves dealing with a mob-connected banker and help out some homeless. The other TOs want Tim to win, as the competition is his last fond memory of his lost partner Isabelle.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "8815074", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 1823, "number_of_episodes": 144}
