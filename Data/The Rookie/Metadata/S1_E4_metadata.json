They can earn a day off by learning some secret about their new TOs, but end up refusing so gratefully. Lopez takes Nolan to court, where he chases an escaped prisoner, leading to a potentially career-making bust for the pair as a Latino mobster, grateful to be allowed finishing his daughter's quinceanera, tips them off for a drug bust. Tim Bradford learns the worst way that West struggles when he freezes during a shootout and bitterly confronts Lopez, who claims they can't take on his brass father, so Tim takes West to meet grateful agoraphobic citizen Wallace, who counsels West on facing his fears. Chen defends, on patrol, her relationship with Nolan to Bishop, who threatens to expose them, prompting Nolan and Chen to have a talk about ending their relationship.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "8855928", "rating": 7.7, "votes": 1906, "number_of_episodes": 144}
