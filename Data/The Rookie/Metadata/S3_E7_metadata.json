Harris is reported missing from his house, with blood later identified to his former co-star, Charlotte Luster, and a mummified Charlie Chaplin is found under his bed. Luster is reported missing next, her car found at LAX. Harris is found alive, and remains silent for five hours before demanding a lawyer, actually Wesley.
