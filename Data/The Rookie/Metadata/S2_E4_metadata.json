As they pull over a car without plate, all four occupants flee, one falling deep of a roof top. Harper puts forward her body cam, showing he jumped himself and she didn't push him.

Commenced an operation to set up Teagan, Nolan spots another suspect, Osito, leaving the scene and when Nyla tells him she doesn't answer to him, Nolan agrees but warns her he won't roll over and take an antagonistic relationship.
