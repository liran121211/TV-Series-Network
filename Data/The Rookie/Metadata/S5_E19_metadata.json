Nolan and Celina get a call about another such missing child. An older officer shows up at the scene, whom Celina recognizes and trusts from her case, but he makes Nolan suspicious by asking to enter the scene against procedure, as if to destroy evidence. Grey questions the retired investigator about Celina's sister's kidnapping, leading the team to a serial sex offender suspected, but never tied to the case. Harper's detailed questions about the Juarez case catch him in a lie raising suspicions higher. He's releases to be tailed, but uses his police skills to break it. Lucy finds a recent case he worked on, clearing a house of squatters a few miles from the abduction. The team surrounds the house and talks the officer into letting the victim go, but when they move in, he points his gun against Tim, who shoots him. Lucy offers to help Tim get through the experience, and he offers to help her study for her detective exam.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "27136042", "rating": 7.9, "votes": 951, "number_of_episodes": 144}
