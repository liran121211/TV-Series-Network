1
00:00:01,141 --> 00:00:04,049
<u>I just wanted to give
the judges some happy juice</u>

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:05,295
before we got started.

3
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:07,167
The world needs
more love, man.

4
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:10,315
I agree, but meth smoothies
are a felony.

5
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:12,147
My backpack.
I left it in the green room.

6
00:00:12,147 --> 00:00:13,353
It has my ID in it.

7
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:14,757
Go get it, Boot.
Meet me down at the shop.

8
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:15,793
It's the fluffy one.

9
00:00:15,793 --> 00:00:16,998
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:18,950
Oh.
Sorry.

11
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:22,018
Uh, so sorry.

12
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:28,493
There you are.
Come on.
Oh, no, I --

13
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:30,027
You're up next.
I'm actually not --

14
00:00:30,027 --> 00:00:31,730
First you'll speak to Ryan, then
you go in front of the judges.

15
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,314
You'll only have 15 minutes,
so make them count.

16
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:34,389
They're --
That's act--
Let's go!

17
00:00:35,594 --> 00:00:36,800
Hello. Hi.

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,294
Oh!
Hi.

19
00:00:38,294 --> 00:00:40,286
You're --
I like it.
The cop uniform.

20
00:00:40,286 --> 00:00:41,740
That is fun.
Um...

21
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,523
What's your name?
Um, uh, I'm -- I'm Lucy Chen,

22
00:00:43,523 --> 00:00:44,808
but that -- there's
actually been a mistake.
Hi, Lucy.

23
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:46,422
I'm not supposed to --
No, look, I understand.

24
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,836
You're nervous.
Everybody is.
No.

25
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:49,290
Just before you get in there,
take a deep breath.
It's time.

26
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,993
No, I'm not --
And do your thing.

27
00:00:50,993 --> 00:00:53,563
What?
Sing your heart out,
okay, Lucy?

28
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:55,844
Uh...

29
00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:56,970
How are you?
How are you?

30
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,623
-Uh...
-Hold on. Are we okay?

31
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:01,243
-Yeah. Hi.
-Hi.

32
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:02,777
Uh, right in the center
there.
Are we in trouble?

33
00:01:02,777 --> 00:01:05,058
No, no. Of course not.
I...

34
00:01:05,058 --> 00:01:09,211
I-I got pushed in here,
and, uh, it's it's...

35
00:01:10,954 --> 00:01:12,568
Are you a co--
a contestant?

36
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:16,393
Um, you know, I...

37
00:01:16,393 --> 00:01:17,967
I seem to be
wearing a sticker right now.

38
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:19,212
Okay, who are you?

39
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:21,084
Hi, I-I'm Lucy Chen.

40
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:22,578
I'm from Los Angeles.

41
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:23,943
Are you
in the right place?

42
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:26,015
There was a very, uh,
sweet woman that

43
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:29,342
put a sticker on me,
and Seacrest kind of

44
00:01:29,342 --> 00:01:30,746
-Well, welcome to the show.
-Thank you.

45
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:32,330
-I mean, yeah.
-Okay.

46
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:36,394
Um, Officer, what are you
going to sing for us today?

47
00:01:36,394 --> 00:01:38,017
Oh. Uh...

48
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:39,631
You're on the tee.
You got the number.

49
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:41,005
-You got the number.
-Yeah.

50
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:44,860
I'll sing, um, "I-I Never Loved
a Man" by Aretha.

51
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,816
It's one of
my favorites.

52
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:48,386
Oh, wow. Okay.

00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:51,884
Uh, I'm so--
What?

73
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:52,920
I have to go.
Lionel and Katy:
Wait, no, no, no, no,

74
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,916
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:56,705
-Coming!
-Wait, wait.

77
00:02:56,705 --> 00:02:57,901
What are you doing
here?

78
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,813

Court appearance.

83
00:03:11,517 --> 00:03:12,682
Ever given blood before?

84
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:13,877
Every eight weeks,
like clockwork.

85
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:15,292
Good for you.

86
00:03:15,292 --> 00:03:17,164
Yeah, save lives,
get a personal oil change.

87
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,449
It's win-win.

88
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,192
I didn't know
machines had blood.

89
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:24,256
You know the drill.
Light squeezes.

90
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:26,667
How's it going,
Mr. AB Negative?
Good.

91
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:29,117
Donating blood is bringing back
some complicated memories

92
00:03:29,117 --> 00:03:30,442
of when Henry was born.

93
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:31,856
He had TOF.

94
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:33,719
I spent a lot of time
in the hospital banking blood.

95
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,635
I had no idea.

96
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:36,338
What's TOF?
Tetralogy of Fallot.

97
00:03:36,338 --> 00:03:37,205
It's a heart defect.

98
00:03:37,205 --> 00:03:38,540
Four defects, actually.

99
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,944
It's corrected
by surgery.

100
00:03:39,944 --> 00:03:42,723
Three of them he had
before he was a year old.

101
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,466
Since we share the same
rare blood type,

102
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:47,375
I donated approximately
16 gallons.

103
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:48,699
But everything's okay
right now, right?

104
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:50,861
Oh, yeah. All his checkups
have been fantastic.

105
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,524
Thank God.

106
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,058
So,
when are we going out again?

107
00:03:54,058 --> 00:03:56,090
How about this weekend?
I can't.

108
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,873
Um, Oliver's coming, and I'm
gonna take him to Disneyland.

109
00:03:57,873 --> 00:03:59,656
Oh, I could tag along.

110
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,359
Um...
Or not.

111
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:04,517
It's just -- I only have him
every other weekend, so I...

112
00:04:04,517 --> 00:04:06,300
No need to explain.
How about dinner tonight?

113
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,923
Great.
Yeah, that sounds good.

114
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,951
Make sure you drink
the whole thing down.

115
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:14,348
Woman, I'm a grown-ass man.
I don't need a juice box.

116
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:16,091
Whoa.

117
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:17,047
You okay?

118
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:18,461
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

119
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,663
Sir, did you just faint?

120
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:22,605
No, I briefly
succumbed to gravity.

121
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:41,161
Sorry.
I was trying to be quiet.

122
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:43,403
It's not you. It's the wind
that keeps waking me up.

123
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:45,395
Yeah, it's supposed to
get worse by tonight.

124
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:47,178
These graveyard shifts
are brutal.

125
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:49,299
But tonight
is the last one.

126
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:51,082
And then five days
in Napa.

127
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,616
I have
every detail planned.

128
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:55,355
Horseback riding, couples
massages, hot-air-balloon ride.

129
00:04:55,355 --> 00:04:56,849
You're forgetting
a very important word here.

130
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:58,174
Wine.

131
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,216
Oh, I got reservations
at six tasting rooms.

132
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,581
Good.
Mm-hmm.

133
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:02,995
Mm.

134
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:06,810
Now go away so I can sleep.

135
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,473
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:09,549
I love ya.

137
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:10,545
I love you, too.

138
00:05:14,818 --> 00:05:16,232
Don't act so happy
to see me.

139
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,936
If you're here in person,
it means something is wrong.

140
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,585
It's Lila.

141
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:21,751
What's Lila?

142
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:23,364
Wait.

143
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,067
Don't freak out.

144
00:05:28,683 --> 00:05:29,799
She's having nightmares
again.

145
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,253
Three nights this week,

146
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:33,325
she woke me up
saying she heard screaming.

147
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:36,114
Then last night, she said she
saw a ghost outside her window.

148
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:38,066
A ghost?
I could
barely console her.

149
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:40,466
She wanted you.
She said only Mommy can help.

150
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:42,210
Did you look
outside her window?

151
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,913
For a ghost? No.

152
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:44,779
She was
having a nightmare.

153
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,981
It has nothing to do
with ghosts.

154
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,226
You think it's about
what happened?

155
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:49,311
Of course.

156
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:54,122
Okay, um, thank you
for telling me.

157
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:56,861
I can come by the house
in a little bit

158
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:58,316
and talk to her myself.

159
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:59,521
Can you do that
while you're on duty?

160
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:01,882
Yeah,
when it's important.

161
00:06:01,882 --> 00:06:03,545
Good.
Good.

162
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:05,368
I need to get
a restraining order.

163
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:07,111
Okay.
Uh, against whom?

164
00:06:07,111 --> 00:06:08,774
My cat.

165
00:06:08,774 --> 00:06:10,268
Meow Tse Tung.

166
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:13,426
I'm sorry, sir. We only handle
complaints here against people.

167
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:14,502
Don't you want to know
what he did?

168
00:06:14,502 --> 00:06:16,653
I really don't.

169
00:06:16,653 --> 00:06:18,406
I hope you have
a nice day.

170
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,880
Hi.
I'm Valerie Castillo.

171
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,534
I work for
the Los Angeles Herald.

172
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:28,157
I'm here to see
yesterday's case reports.

173
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:30,100
Okay.

174
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,185
You a crime reporter?

175
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:33,048
Um, not yet.

176
00:06:33,048 --> 00:06:35,787
I write for the Style Section,
going on 15 years.

177
00:06:35,787 --> 00:06:38,028
Oh.
But I'm over it.

178
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:40,230
It's all been reduced to
sex tips and celebrity gossip.

179
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,554
You know, the clickbait.

180
00:06:41,554 --> 00:06:43,596
Mm, so you're fishing
for a real story?

181
00:06:43,596 --> 00:06:45,499
Actually,
I've already got one.

182
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:46,833
Do you know
anything about

183
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,656
a bunch of robberies
at five-star hotels?

184
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:49,981
Mm, first I've heard
of it.

185
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:51,893
Well, a concierge
at the Borden

186
00:06:51,893 --> 00:06:53,766
told me that two guests
were beaten and robbed there

187
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:55,170
in the last few weeks.

188
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,910
Now, neither victim
want her to contact the police.

189
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,613
When I went to
other stations

190
00:06:59,613 --> 00:07:01,187
to look through
the crime reports,

191
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:04,633
I found three similar incidents
in hotels around town.

192
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,416
Is there a description
of the attacker?

193
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,537
No, because
none of the men gave one.

194
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:10,201
But the cases
have to be connected.

195
00:07:10,201 --> 00:07:12,392
Yeah, I mean,
it sure seems like it.
Right?

196
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:15,131
You know, you don't want
the case reports.

197
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:16,795
There's actually
a lot more information

198
00:07:16,795 --> 00:07:18,080
in the CAD printouts.

199
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,325
What are those?

200
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:20,948
Computer Aided Dispatch
reports.

201
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:23,020
Why are you volunteering
to show her those?

202
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,305
This is a reporter
from the Herald,

203
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:26,088
and these are
public-facing documents.

204
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:27,672
Valerie Castillo.

205
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:30,530
They're only public-facing
when asked for.

206
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,226
Can I see the CAD reports,
please?

207
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:36,098
Fine.
Give 'em to her.

208
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:38,459
Thank you.
Not a fan of the press?

209
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,411
Eh, Herald's got
a bias against the police.

210
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:41,696
No, we don't.
It's implicit.

211
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:43,857
Unlike your bias
against me.
Cute.

212
00:07:45,352 --> 00:07:47,593
You know, the media
will say or do anything

213
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:48,708
to get you
to back up their headline.

214
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,830
And make sure she gives you
those printouts back.

215
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,274
And get ready to roll.

216
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:53,400
We're gonna hit the streets
as soon as I change.

217
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,645
Yes, sir.

218
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:56,517
You shouldn't let him
talk to you like that.

219
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,745
He's my training officer.
That's just kind of his style.

220
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,368
Well, being an ass
isn't style.

221
00:08:02,284 --> 00:08:03,530
But he sure can
wear a suit.

222
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:10,044
I thought that only happened
in Road Runner cartoons.

223
00:08:10,044 --> 00:08:11,657
It's the Santa Ana winds.

224
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,649
You're officially
an LA resident now.

225
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:15,313
Nyla!

226
00:08:15,313 --> 00:08:17,096
Is that you?

227
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,875
It's been too long!

228
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,498
Yeah, no, yeah.
It sure has.

229
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:23,909
Sorry about
you and Donovan.

230
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:26,140
You were always
such a lovely family.

231
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,337
Benjamin and I are in a bit of
a rough patch right now, too.

232
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:31,210
Why are relationships so hard?

233
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,744
Because most people suck.

234
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,065
Well, I-I'll let you go.

235
00:08:35,065 --> 00:08:36,768
I hope to see you around
more often.

236
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:39,009
Oh, yeah.
You, too.

237
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:41,210
Who was that?
No clue.

238
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,415
Don and I bought this house

239
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:44,776
while I was neck-deep
in undercover work.

240
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:47,555
I could barely focus on my
family, let alone the neighbors.

241
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,701
Everything okay?

242
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,982
Uh, yeah.

243
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:58,970
No, I just -- I haven't been
inside since we separated.

244
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,056
Hey.
Hi.

245
00:09:11,341 --> 00:09:13,213
Donovan,
nice to see you again.

246
00:09:13,213 --> 00:09:14,907
Yeah. You, too.

247
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:17,736
Come on in.
Thank you.

248
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:20,056
Wow.

249
00:09:20,056 --> 00:09:21,839
You redecorated.

250
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,499
Yeah. Place needed
some new energy.

251
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:28,065
So, uh, did you hire
a decorator, or...

252
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:29,887
No. Did it all myself.

253
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,053
Oh.

254
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:32,507
What?

255
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:33,921
Nothing. No.
You said, "Oh."

256
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:37,358
I -- It -- You just never
really had -- had style before.

257
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,605
Mommy!

258
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:42,258
Hi, baby.

259
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:43,593
Mm.

260
00:09:43,593 --> 00:09:44,539
Let's go talk in your room,
'kay?

261
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:46,412
Okay.

262
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:47,866
Something to drink?

263
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:49,400
Oh, no, I'm good,
thanks.

264
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,801
Sorry to hear that you've been
having some rough nights.

265
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:53,673
Yeah,
it's not the first time.

266
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:56,163
She's been having nightmares
on and off for over a year,

267
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,115
ever since...

268
00:09:58,115 --> 00:10:00,187
it happened.

269
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:02,558
Ever since what happened?

270
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:04,749
So Daddy tells me

271
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:06,293
that you are not
sleeping so good.

272
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:08,992
Mnh-mnh.
I keep getting woken up.

273
00:10:08,992 --> 00:10:11,273
By the nightmares?
They're not nightmares.

274
00:10:11,273 --> 00:10:12,977
I hear
somebody screaming.

275
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:14,550
Honey, it's probably
just the wind.

276
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,662
I mean, the Santa Anas
are really blowing.

277
00:10:16,662 --> 00:10:18,993
No, but it started
before them.

278
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,274
Okay.

279
00:10:21,274 --> 00:10:23,883
And then last night, did you
tell Daddy you saw a ghost?

280
00:10:23,883 --> 00:10:26,005
I said it looked
like a ghost.

281
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:28,953
Ghosts aren't real.

282
00:10:28,953 --> 00:10:30,647
Okay, so,
what did you see, then?

283
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:33,187
Well, I saw a woman...

284
00:10:33,187 --> 00:10:34,511
walking down the street.

285
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:36,713
In a nightgown.

286
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,488
She had blood
on her hands.

287
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:45,050
It was right before
we split.

288
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,340
Nyla had been
working undercover

289
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,203
for almost a year,

290
00:10:49,203 --> 00:10:50,697
had barely come home.

291
00:10:50,697 --> 00:10:52,231
We were in a bad place,

292
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,855
but we were trying to
make it work.

293
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:56,962
And then she took Lila
to the supermarket.

294
00:10:59,293 --> 00:11:00,698
You know why we moved
out here?

295
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:02,152
'Cause it's
a nice neighborhood?

296
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:04,722
'Cause it was
nowhere near where Nyla worked.

297
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:06,554
She couldn't run the risk of
running into a criminal

298
00:11:06,554 --> 00:11:08,168
who knew her
as someone else on the street.

299
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,831
And that's what happened
at the store.

300
00:11:09,831 --> 00:11:11,365
A drug dealer
she'd put away.

301
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:14,144
He recognized her.

302
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:19,254
And tried to kill her
in front of my daughter.

303
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:20,499
Do you believe me?

304
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:22,033
Honey, I-I --

305
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,736
No lies. You promised.

306
00:11:25,848 --> 00:11:27,222
Yes.

307
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:29,673
I believe you.

308
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:31,824
And I'm glad
you wanted to tell me.

309
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,444
You're a police officer,
and someone needs help.

310
00:11:36,844 --> 00:11:38,050
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

311
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,464
No, no, it's, um...

312
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,452
What?
What's going on?

313
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:44,693
Just waiting on you.
How'd it go?

314
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:48,926
Uh, Lila says it wasn't a ghost
and it wasn't a nightmare.

315
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:50,460
And I believe her.

316
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,496
Then what was it?
I don't know.

317
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:55,520
But, um, I would like
to stay here tonight,

318
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,389
maybe do some surveillance,
if that's okay.

319
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:00,092
You really think
that's necessary?

320
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:02,831
Well, Lila needs to see that
we're taking her seriously.

321
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:03,987
Oh, and I don't?

322
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:06,477
I-I am sure
that's not what she meant.

323
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:09,256
It's not.
I ju--

324
00:12:09,256 --> 00:12:10,750
I just want to be here
for her.

325
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:15,033
Okay. Sure.

326
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,029
Come back tonight.

327
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:17,852
Okay.

328
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:19,884
Don told you
about what happened.

329
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:21,627
It sounded awful.

330
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:25,193
Yeah, it was, and he used it
against me in court.

331
00:12:25,193 --> 00:12:26,946
He convinced the judge

332
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,974
that Lila wasn't safe
around me unsupervised.

333
00:12:29,974 --> 00:12:31,627
That was also awful.

334
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:41,179
What is it?

335
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:43,540
Uh, Lila's room
is right there.

336
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,110
She said the woman
with the blood on her hands

337
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,646
was right about here.

338
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:51,090
Does that look like blood
to you?

339
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,425
Could be.

340
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:55,204
Or oil
or transmission fluid.

341
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:56,568
Want me to call in
a forensics team?

342
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,557
For a ghost hunt? No,
they'd laugh me off the radio.

343
00:12:59,557 --> 00:13:01,140
I could call it in.

344
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,306
Rookies get laughed at
all the time.

345
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:03,919
I appreciate that,
but odds are it's nothing.

346
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,734
Alright, uh,
back to work.

347
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:11,469
I'm telling you.
Reporters always have an agenda.

348
00:13:11,469 --> 00:13:13,551
To get the truth?
Sounds horrible.

349
00:13:13,551 --> 00:13:14,956
Don't be so naive.

350
00:13:14,956 --> 00:13:16,121
Well
I am not naive.

351
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:17,984
I'm just not like you.

352
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:18,980
God,
you don't trust anyone.

353
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,812
'Cause trust
has to be earned.

354
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:22,635
All I'm saying is
watch your back

355
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,671
when dealing
with the press.

356
00:13:23,671 --> 00:13:26,161
7-Adam-19, 415-fight.

357
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:27,864
Manager versus customer
in a physical.

358
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:30,892
Multiple RPs. E&L Auto Body.
3905.

359
00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,133
Copy that.
En route, Code 3.

360
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:34,966
$2,000. That's final.

361
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,669
That's not
what you quoted me!

362
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:39,239
I'm not giving you
a penny more than $500!

363
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:41,849
$2,000!
No pay, no car! I keep!

364
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:43,144
Like hell you will.

365
00:13:43,144 --> 00:13:45,295
Say hello
to William Snakespeare, bitch!

366
00:13:45,295 --> 00:13:47,038
Hey! Drop the snake!
Drop it!

367
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:48,662
Ohh! Ohh!
Drop the snake!

368
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:49,618
-Aah!
-Oh.

369
00:13:49,618 --> 00:13:51,690
Get that away from me!
Aah! Aah!

370
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,935
Oh, no.

371
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,995
Where the hell did it go?
I don't know.

372
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:05,754
Sir, just stay where you are.
The ambulance is on its way.

373
00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:07,916
He's not gonna make it.
Animal control's 10 minutes out.

374
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:08,912
EMTs won't
step foot in here

375
00:14:08,912 --> 00:14:10,366
until that snake's
been neutralized.

376
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:12,896
Damn it, well, we can't
stay up here while he's dying.

377
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:13,892
Alright, we'll just flush it out
in the open.

378
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:15,804
I'll end it.
You can't kill it.

379
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,797
What the hell are we supposed to
do with it? Snuggle?

380
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:21,233
Boot, don't be a hero.
It's venomous.

381
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:44,311
Whoa.

382
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,521
Hey, there, Snakespeare.

383
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:56,593
It's okay.

384
00:14:56,593 --> 00:14:59,043
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I just...

385
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:01,872
Ohh.

386
00:15:01,872 --> 00:15:03,236
Oh.

387
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,105
Okay.

388
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:12,659
Hoo! It's not his fault
his owner's an idiot.

389
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:14,233
Control, advise fire
and ambulance

390
00:15:14,233 --> 00:15:16,892
our scene is Code 4 --
clear to enter.

391
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:24,741
Can I ask you a favor?

392
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:26,474
Sure.

393
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:27,520
No, never mind.

394
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,725
Come on. What is it?

395
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:32,501
Yeah, this whole
spending the night

396
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:33,995
at my ex's house
thing is --

397
00:15:33,995 --> 00:15:36,276
You're nervous.

398
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:38,387
Y-Yeah, yeah,
that one of us is gonna

399
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:39,841
end up leaving
in a body bag.

400
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:45,529
It would be nice if I,
you know, had a...buffer.

401
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:49,224
And you're good at...

402
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:51,177
people...things.

403
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:52,461
You know what?
Never mind. Forget it.

404
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,284
This is a bad idea.
No, no, no, it's not.

405
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:56,027
I just have, uh,
a dinner date with Grace,

406
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:57,193
but I can reschedule it.

407
00:15:57,193 --> 00:15:59,055
No, no.
Go on your date.

408
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:00,599
No, it's fine.
I'll be fine.

409
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,462
No, really.
It's not a problem.

410
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,747
I'll see you tomorrow.

411
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:10,799
Hey, roomie!

412
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,418
Oh, man, I feel like
I haven't seen you in forever!

413
00:16:13,418 --> 00:16:15,699
Well, because you haven't.
Night shifts suck.

414
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:17,403
Oh.
You try sleeping in our
apartment during the day.

415
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:20,311
The sirens, construction,
helicopters.

416
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:22,592
All so Lopez can have
her wine country vacation.

417
00:16:22,592 --> 00:16:23,837
Well, hang in there.

418
00:16:23,837 --> 00:16:26,327
You've only got
one more night of vampire ops.

419
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:28,190
Then five days off,

420
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,431
and I'll relish
every minute.

421
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:31,517
Mm-hmm.

422
00:16:31,517 --> 00:16:33,668
Valerie.
Hey, you're back.

423
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:36,497
Hey. Yes. To thank you for
getting me those CAD reports.

424
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:38,688
Yeah. Well, did they help
with your story?

425
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:40,810
You're kidding me.
It's even bigger than I thought.

426
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,509
You know, every one of those
assault victims lives in town.

427
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:46,079
Who gets a hotel room in
the same city that you live in?

428
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,147
Uh, well, men who are
hooking up with sex workers.

429
00:16:49,147 --> 00:16:51,976
Exactly. I'm convinced
it's a Murphy scam.

430
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:54,336
You know, the rich guy
meets an escort at the hotel --

431
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:56,617
Yeah, and gets beaten up and
robbed by her accomplice

432
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:58,320
but can't report it because
then he'd be copping

433
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,860
to his own crime.
This was the story
that I was looking for

434
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,683
and my editor
said to run with it

435
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:04,088
and I couldn't have cracked it
without you.

436
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:07,126
So I want to buy you a drink
to say, you know, thank you.

437
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,237
Oh, uh, I shouldn't.

438
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,438
Why? Because your training
officer would disapprove?

439
00:17:11,438 --> 00:17:14,138
Uh, no, no.
Okay, listen, listen.

440
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:16,379
You helped me,
and I want to return the favor.

441
00:17:16,379 --> 00:17:18,202
So any time I get any
information on crimes,

442
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:20,692
I can feed it to you,
and you can make the arrests.

443
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,862
This week has been ass.

444
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:33,929
I get it.
You're tired. I'm tired.

445
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:35,842
So tonight,
we're the dream team.

446
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,665
We'll take turns
copping some Z's...

447
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:39,537
...while the other
keeps their eye on the onboard

448
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:41,071
and listens for calls.

449
00:17:41,071 --> 00:17:42,396
Wesley excited
about the trip?

450
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,229
That's an understatement.

451
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,509
Guy's got it planned
to the nth degree.

452
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:48,830
We're gonna get massages,
ride horses,

453
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,285
fly in a hot-air balloon.

454
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:54,807
Oh, damn.

455
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,261
What?

456
00:17:56,261 --> 00:17:58,920
The boy's gonna propose.

457
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,707
What?

458
00:17:59,707 --> 00:18:01,201
Hot-air balloon?

459
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:02,984
Proposal.

460
00:18:04,608 --> 00:18:06,759
Shut up. You're wrong.

461
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,502
Okay.

462
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,720
Damn it, you're right.

463
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,174
Salut.

464
00:18:18,174 --> 00:18:22,079
So, you've got a bunch of
victims who aren't talking.

465
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,363
Wrong.

466
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:24,648
They're not talking
to the police,

467
00:18:24,648 --> 00:18:26,680
but I got one of the guys
to talk to me off the record

468
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,633
this afternoon.
And...?

469
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:30,336
It's exactly
what I thought.

470
00:18:30,336 --> 00:18:32,328
He hooked up
with a woman online.

471
00:18:32,328 --> 00:18:34,111
They went to a hotel,
they go upstairs,

472
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,183
they get naked,
then a guy walks in with a gun.

473
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:38,802
He steals the guy's watch,
money, phone,

474
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:40,625
and then tells him,
"If you talk,

475
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:41,621
your family's
gonna get hurt."

476
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,747
Did you get
a description?

477
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,818
Better.
He gave me the woman.

478
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:47,060
Now we're gonna catch her
in the act.

479
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,831
Uh, we-- um...

480
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,534
Y-You lied to me.

481
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,855
No. No, I-I didn't.

482
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:58,185
I told you
I was gonna help you,

483
00:18:58,185 --> 00:19:00,297
and this way I was
gonna get a killer story

484
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:03,455
and you were gonna get
a high-profile arrest.
I'm a rookie.

485
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:06,064
I can't just run around
arresting people by myself.

486
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:07,150
Come on. Why not?

487
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,013
What?!

488
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:10,297
Holy crap.

489
00:19:11,174 --> 00:19:12,339
That's Alex Shaw.

490
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:14,202
Who?
The huge movie producer.

491
00:19:14,202 --> 00:19:16,025
And his wife
is super pregnant.

492
00:19:16,025 --> 00:19:17,688
This is suddenly
a front-page story.

493
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:19,720
This is amazing!

494
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,503
Oh, no, no, no, no.
They're gonna leave. Let's go.

495
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:23,087
What?
I booked the room
right next to hers.

496
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:24,661
Come on!

497
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,115
Let's go, Lucy.

498
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,689
Hey.
Hey.

499
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:38,775
Just about to
get dinner started.

500
00:19:38,775 --> 00:19:40,767
You hungry?
Um, I could eat.

501
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:42,839
Hey, Mama.
Hi, baby.

502
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:45,249
I can take the couch tonight
if you want the bed.

503
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:47,072
No, sleep in my room.

504
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:51,265
No, I will take the couch
because I am not here to sleep.

505
00:19:51,265 --> 00:19:53,217
I am here to
keep an eye out, right?

506
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:54,672
Right.
Right.

507
00:19:54,672 --> 00:19:56,166
Ohh. Wow.

508
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,451
What?
Uh, nothing.

509
00:19:57,451 --> 00:19:59,652
It's just...
a little stiff.

510
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:01,226
No, it's not.
It's structured.
Mm-hmm.

511
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:05,917
Did daddy really pick
this couch out himself?

512
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,905
No.
The lady helped him.

513
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:10,190
What lady?

514
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,262
The lady from the store.

515
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:13,258
Go wash your hands
for dinner.

516
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:14,214
Am I in trouble?

517
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,997
Oh, no, honey.

518
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,581
I am.

519
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,254
Don't do that.

520
00:20:24,254 --> 00:20:26,376
Do not use her to get
information about me.

521
00:20:26,376 --> 00:20:28,488
I wa-- I wasn't doing that.
I-I didn't...mean...

522
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:29,534
You always mean to.

523
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:30,898
This...

524
00:20:34,056 --> 00:20:36,088
Hey! Here we are!
And we brought dinner!

525
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:38,578
What?
Uh...

526
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:40,231
Nolan came to help
with the stakeout.

527
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:41,436
Yeah, and I brought
a dinner guest.

528
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:43,020
I hope that's okay.
Hi. I'm Grace.

529
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,421
Uh, Donovan.
Yes, come in, please.

530
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:47,203
I'll...go get some...
plates for this.

531
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:48,907
-I'll help.
-Thank you.

532
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,393
Thank you.

533
00:20:52,393 --> 00:20:54,096
No problem.
How's it going?

534
00:20:54,096 --> 00:20:55,929
I think
he's seeing someone.

535
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,160
This place looks
way too nice.

536
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,859
Y-You do know you're divorced,
right?
It's not about that.

537
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,901
It's about him bringing someone
into our child's life

538
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:04,346
that I have never met.

539
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,511
Okay.

540
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:10,740
Oh, God. Quick.

541
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,736
Take a selfie with me.

542
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,049
It's too far away.
I can't see their faces.

543
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,175
I need to get closer.
Come on.

544
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,539
Not without blowing it.

545
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:20,243
What are you doing?

546
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:21,826
I'm texting Tim.
I need a senior officer here.

547
00:21:21,826 --> 00:21:24,057
No, you don't!
He'll just steal the credit.

548
00:21:24,057 --> 00:21:25,601
Look, I am out on a limb here,
okay?

549
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:27,175
And as a rookie,
that could get me fired.

550
00:21:27,175 --> 00:21:30,243
So we either do this
by the book or I walk.

551
00:21:30,243 --> 00:21:31,159
Fine.

552
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,919
Your daughter's got
a lot of talent.

553
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,120
Art has been a really great
outlet for her.

554
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,112
It's been a tough year.
For all of us.

555
00:21:43,112 --> 00:21:45,313
But especially for Lila.

556
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,915
Divorce is --
is hard on kids.

557
00:21:49,915 --> 00:21:51,499
I'm going through one myself,

558
00:21:51,499 --> 00:21:55,692
and I feel like every decision
and thought that I make

559
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:58,013
is built around how it will
affect my son.

560
00:21:58,013 --> 00:21:59,338
He does not believe this,

561
00:21:59,338 --> 00:22:01,081
but, yes,
I feel the exact same way.

562
00:22:01,081 --> 00:22:02,077
Why are you putting words
in my mouth?

563
00:22:02,077 --> 00:22:03,740
Are you saying
that you've never said that?

564
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,985
We're not having this fight
right now.

565
00:22:04,985 --> 00:22:06,230
-Sounds like a good idea.
-Oh, great.

566
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,934
So now
you're taking his side?
Oh, no.

567
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:11,250
You know what? How about we just
get this out into the open?

568
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,910
You are obviously
allowed to date someone new.

569
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,231
Thank you?
But you should have
introduced me to her

570
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:18,761
before bringing her
into our daughter's world.

571
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:20,334
What are you talking about?
I'm not dating anyone.

572
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:21,878
Okay, so,
I'm just supposed to believe

573
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:23,412
you redecorated
all by yourself?

574
00:22:23,412 --> 00:22:24,777
Yeah. You are.

575
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:27,357
You were using towels
as curtains when I met you.

576
00:22:27,357 --> 00:22:29,140
Okay, you know what?

577
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,550
We agreed we would take it slow
and we would give each other

578
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,781
the courtesy of meeting
whomever we were dating.

579
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:35,903
Again,
not dating anyone.

580
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:37,477
It really sounds like
he's not dating anyone.

581
00:22:37,477 --> 00:22:41,052
I'm sure before Nolan met your
son, you...talked to your ex.

582
00:22:41,052 --> 00:22:42,417
Actually,
I still haven't met Oliver.

583
00:22:42,417 --> 00:22:44,658
Yeah, there just
hasn't been the right time.

584
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:47,606
Right, and this is --
it's still new.

585
00:22:47,606 --> 00:22:50,764
It doesn't mean anything.
Yeah.
No, I mean, I know. Yeah.

586
00:22:50,764 --> 00:22:53,294
-
-Yeah. So...

587
00:22:53,294 --> 00:22:54,539
What you guys talking about?

588
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:01,591
Me? What did I do?
Now I can't relax.

589
00:23:01,591 --> 00:23:04,460
I'm gonna be reading into every
little thing Wesley does,

590
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,113
waiting for him
to propose.

591
00:23:06,113 --> 00:23:08,195
Now I have to be "on"
the whole time,

592
00:23:08,195 --> 00:23:10,227
worrying about what I'm wearing
and how my hair looks.

593
00:23:10,227 --> 00:23:12,010
Okay,
you might be over-thinking this.

594
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,713
He better not propose
on the hot-air balloon.

595
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:16,910
I get motion sickness.

596
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,693
What if I throw up?

597
00:23:18,693 --> 00:23:20,685
What if I drop the ring
from a thousand feet up?

598
00:23:20,685 --> 00:23:22,259
Okay. You crazy.

599
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:25,038
And I'm going to sleep.

600
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:27,120
Thank you so much
for doing this tonight.
Of course.

601
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,112
It was fun.

602
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:31,931
Okay,
I mean interesting.
Ah.

603
00:23:31,931 --> 00:23:34,799
You know, that seems to be
a theme with our dates --

604
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,662
chasing down stolen cars,

605
00:23:36,662 --> 00:23:38,654
uncomfortable dinners
with your partner.

606
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:40,477
Maybe next time
you can take me to a funeral.

607
00:23:40,477 --> 00:23:42,011
Well, when you say it like that,
it sounds weird.

608
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:46,951
Listen, um, earlier tonight,
uh, with Oliver...

609
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:48,784
John, it's not that.
I don't want you --

610
00:23:48,784 --> 00:23:51,732
Thank you
so much for coming.
Ah.

611
00:23:51,732 --> 00:23:53,884
I mean, two buffers is
definitely better than one.

612
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:56,792
Of course.
Sorry that I have to rush out.

613
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:58,406
I only have my sitter
until 9:00.

614
00:23:58,406 --> 00:23:59,701
Oh, my God,
now I feel even worse.

615
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:02,231
You wasted a date night
here?

616
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:04,093
Don't be silly.
I'm happy to.

617
00:24:04,093 --> 00:24:05,418
Good luck
with everything.

618
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:06,832
I hope that Lila
is okay.

619
00:24:06,832 --> 00:24:08,904
-Thank you.
-I'll walk you out.

620
00:24:11,444 --> 00:24:12,390
Good night.

621
00:24:24,801 --> 00:24:27,630
Hey, thanks for coming.
Mm-hmm.

622
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,951
I'm in trouble, aren't I?
Mm-hmm.

623
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:32,570
If he punishes you in any way,
I'll write a story about it.

624
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,353
No, don't do that.
Do not do that.

625
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:35,758
You know that doesn't work.

626
00:24:35,758 --> 00:24:37,053
But there's an app for it.

627
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:38,786
Really?
No.

628
00:24:38,786 --> 00:24:40,121
Shaw still in there
with the escort?

629
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:41,575
Yeah, but there's no sign
of her accomplice.

630
00:24:41,575 --> 00:24:42,571
Maybe he's not coming.

631
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:43,726
Maybe he doesn't exist.

632
00:24:43,726 --> 00:24:45,181
He exists, okay?

633
00:24:45,181 --> 00:24:47,591
And when he comes, he's gonna be
armed and dangerous.

634
00:24:47,591 --> 00:24:49,125
If so, you'll be
nowhere near the action.

635
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,559
And what if
it's not on the hot-air balloon?

636
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:57,014
What if he proposes

637
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:58,876
while we're riding horses
and I fall off?
Okay.

638
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,908
Please just let me
go to sleep!

639
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:03,737
7-Adam-19,
requesting another unit

640
00:25:03,737 --> 00:25:06,137
to the Coldwater Hotel
for a 647-B event.

641
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:07,512
Contact me in the lobby.

642
00:25:07,512 --> 00:25:10,122
7-Adam-07, attach us
to 7-Adam-19's event.

643
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:11,207
Show us en route.

644
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:14,853
Wow.

645
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:17,343
Wind is
really picking up.

646
00:25:17,343 --> 00:25:19,126
I'll take the chair.
You take the couch.

647
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,710
Oh, I can't have that.
I'll take the chair.

648
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,612
Trust me, you are getting
the worst end of the deal.

649
00:25:22,612 --> 00:25:24,445
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.

650
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:27,184
Wow.
Right?!

651
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:28,638
What?! I mean...
I know.

652
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:32,493
Hey, can we talk about me
for a second?

653
00:25:32,493 --> 00:25:33,947
Yeah, sure.
What do you think it means

654
00:25:33,947 --> 00:25:37,473
that Grace doesn't want me
to meet her son?

655
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:39,675
Uh, that she's
a good mother

656
00:25:39,675 --> 00:25:41,458
who is putting
her child's welfare

657
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,529
before everything
and everyone else.

658
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:45,820
So, not that she's...
not that into me?

659
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,972
Are you kidding me?
No. She digs you.

660
00:25:47,972 --> 00:25:50,302
Seems to be
her only flaw.

661
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:52,872
What?

662
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:54,655
Uh...

663
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:55,980
I see a ghost.

664
00:26:08,311 --> 00:26:10,303
Police!
Drop your weapon!

665
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:13,869
It has to die!

666
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:16,738
Ma'am, I need you to put
that shotgun down right now.

667
00:26:20,304 --> 00:26:21,877
Turn around.

668
00:26:21,877 --> 00:26:24,039
Hands on your head.
Interlace your fingers.

669
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:25,951
What the hell
are you doing?

670
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,525
Hunting.
Who?

671
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,059
It.
It?

672
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,390
The coyote
that killed my Snowball.

673
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:33,212
Your what?
My Westie.

674
00:26:33,212 --> 00:26:35,493
Your dog?
My baby.

675
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:40,185
We went out for a walk last
night, and a coyote attacked us.

676
00:26:40,185 --> 00:26:42,008
Is that what happened
to your hand?

677
00:26:42,008 --> 00:26:43,711
I tried to get
between them.

678
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:46,161
I fell. Snowball ran.

679
00:26:46,161 --> 00:26:47,825
She was so scared.

680
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:51,181
The coyote went after her,
and I haven't seen her since.

681
00:26:51,181 --> 00:26:52,845
That damn jackal!

682
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,299
He -- He murdered her!

683
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:57,536
I know it!

684
00:27:01,142 --> 00:27:04,628
That's him.
And he's armed.

685
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:06,042
Dispatch, be advised,

686
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,995
suspect at my location
is armed with a handgun.

687
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:10,445
White male, 6'2",
black jacket, blue jeans.

688
00:27:10,445 --> 00:27:11,560
Here we go.

689
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,094
Alright, stay...

690
00:27:13,094 --> 00:27:14,300
Where is she?
I don't know.

691
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,806
Ah! Aah!

692
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:23,762
Hang on!

693
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,613

We caught your ghost.

729
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:54,732
It was just a nice lady who was
looking for her lost dog.

730
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:56,475
Did you help her find it?

731
00:28:56,475 --> 00:28:58,716
I wish we could have,
honey, but we...

732
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:04,364
I know. It's sad.

733
00:29:04,364 --> 00:29:07,222
Can you stay
till I fall asleep?

734
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:08,557
Yeah, sure.

735
00:29:24,324 --> 00:29:26,317
Snowball?!

736
00:29:26,317 --> 00:29:28,020
Snowball,
is that you, girl?

737
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,625
Well, we thought
you got eaten by a coyote.

738
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:33,289
Way to survive!

739
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:34,534
Come here!

740
00:29:34,534 --> 00:29:36,197
Come here. Hey!

741
00:29:36,197 --> 00:29:37,313
No, don't worry.

742
00:29:37,313 --> 00:29:38,807
It's okay.
I'm a police officer.

743
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,913
Snowball?

744
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:47,064
Hey.

745
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:49,554
Hey, there. How you doing?

746
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:52,304
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
We were worried about you!

747
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:53,499
You were...

748
00:30:19,436 --> 00:30:20,811
I don't want this.

749
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:23,092
I didn't want this,
either.

750
00:30:24,715 --> 00:30:26,080
From the looks of it,
neither does he.

751
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,317
Don't talk about Benjamin!
Don't even look at him!

752
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:32,096
So...

753
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,301
What's happening here?

754
00:30:33,301 --> 00:30:35,293
He tried to leave me.

755
00:30:35,293 --> 00:30:37,913
So I-I needed to show him
that he still loved me.

756
00:30:40,024 --> 00:30:40,901
By drugging him?

757
00:30:40,901 --> 00:30:42,604
He was making
too much noise.

758
00:30:42,604 --> 00:30:45,214
He w-- wouldn't listen.

759
00:30:45,214 --> 00:30:46,957
Now he hears me.

760
00:30:46,957 --> 00:30:48,949
A-And I'm winning him back.

761
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:50,692
And we were
almost happy again

762
00:30:50,692 --> 00:30:53,680
and then you showed up outside
and I couldn't let you find him.

763
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,672
I -- You can't be here.

764
00:30:55,672 --> 00:30:57,704
Okay, c--
You're gonna ruin everything!

765
00:30:57,704 --> 00:31:00,483
Okay. I'll be happy to leave.
Just untie me, and I'll go.

766
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,977
I'm not stupid.

767
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:04,428
You're a cop.
I can't just let you go.

768
00:31:04,428 --> 00:31:06,211
We ju--
We can't have you here.

769
00:31:06,211 --> 00:31:07,625
We s--
We need our privacy.

770
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,502
I have to kill you.

771
00:31:19,956 --> 00:31:21,739
Mama?
Mm-hmm?

772
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:24,179
What if I
still have nightmares?

773
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:26,879
Well, I told you, honey,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

774
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:29,827
It wasn't a ghost.
Not about that.

775
00:31:31,321 --> 00:31:34,977
Sometimes I have dreams

776
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:38,792
that --
that you're getting hurt.

777
00:31:38,792 --> 00:31:41,112
Like at
the grocery store.

778
00:31:41,112 --> 00:31:44,021
Hey.

779
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:45,515
It's okay.

780
00:31:45,515 --> 00:31:48,463
You know I'm okay,
right?

781
00:31:48,463 --> 00:31:50,286
And that's never
gonna happen again.

782
00:31:53,115 --> 00:31:55,605
Sometimes
back then,

783
00:31:55,605 --> 00:31:59,131
I had to pretend
to be a bad guy.

784
00:31:59,131 --> 00:32:00,794
How come?

785
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:03,613
So that real bad guys

786
00:32:03,613 --> 00:32:06,313
would tell me all the bad things
they were doing.

787
00:32:06,313 --> 00:32:09,709
And when I found out,
I'd stop them.

788
00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:13,155
Is that why that scary man
at the store was so mad at you?

789
00:32:15,357 --> 00:32:18,464
Yeah, he figured out that
I wasn't really a bad person,

790
00:32:18,464 --> 00:32:23,245
that I was just a good one
who was pretending.

791
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:25,397
Were you scared?

792
00:32:25,397 --> 00:32:28,056
Yeah. I was.

793
00:32:30,258 --> 00:32:33,206
Until I knew
you were safe.

794
00:32:33,206 --> 00:32:36,443
Because protecting you --

795
00:32:36,443 --> 00:32:38,644
It's all that matters
to me.

796
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,700
Alright, now, get some sleep,
honey. It's late.

797
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,440
And no more bad dreams, okay?

798
00:32:48,894 --> 00:32:49,970
I love you.

799
00:32:53,745 --> 00:32:54,870
Mama?

800
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,195
Yes, Lila?

801
00:32:56,195 --> 00:32:59,641
You said the ghost
was a woman who lost her dog.

802
00:32:59,641 --> 00:33:02,171
But who was the man?

803
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:03,416
What man, baby?

804
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,741
The one
I heard screaming.

805
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:11,176
-Ohh.

806
00:33:11,176 --> 00:33:12,749
I need to do this.

807
00:33:12,749 --> 00:33:14,084
For Benjamin.

808
00:33:16,116 --> 00:33:18,228
I love you so much.

809
00:33:18,228 --> 00:33:20,349
I can't lose you.

810
00:33:20,349 --> 00:33:22,092
If you do this --
If you kill me,

811
00:33:22,092 --> 00:33:23,208
you'll lose him,
for sure.

812
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:25,698
Shut up!

813
00:33:25,698 --> 00:33:29,393
Gah!

814
00:33:29,393 --> 00:33:31,973
What's --
What's wrong with it?

815
00:33:31,973 --> 00:33:33,796
The safety.

816
00:33:33,796 --> 00:33:36,864
Ohh! Aah.

817
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:37,949
Aah!

818
00:33:48,199 --> 00:33:50,480
Wait! Wait!
It's gonna be loud.

819
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,054
Your neighbors
are gonna hear it.

820
00:33:52,054 --> 00:33:53,637
They'll call the police.

821
00:33:57,572 --> 00:33:58,946
Damn it, he's right.

822
00:33:58,946 --> 00:34:01,267
You're right.
Oh, God.

823
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:05,092
What am I gonna do?
Benjamin, help me.

824
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:07,492
I-I could
stab him to death.

825
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:09,365
Ah, no, no.
All the blood.

826
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:11,516
Even if I clean it up, they --
they'll find it

827
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,638
because they have the sprays
and -- and the lights and the...

828
00:34:15,132 --> 00:34:16,835
I know.

829
00:34:43,938 --> 00:34:45,432
I could beat you
to death.

830
00:34:45,432 --> 00:34:47,584
No, whoa, whoa! No, no,
that's gonna be a lot of blood.

831
00:34:47,584 --> 00:34:49,536
It's -- Even more
than if you used the knife.

832
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:50,661
It'll go everywhere.

833
00:34:51,946 --> 00:34:54,685
Damn it!

834
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,847
You die
if you can't breathe.

835
00:35:06,847 --> 00:35:08,341
I know that.

836
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:12,734
I mean, that's just
basic biology.

837
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:14,477
Wait! Wait!

838
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,667
Nyla? It's the middle
of the night.
I know.

839
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:42,456
I'm sorry,
but...

840
00:35:42,456 --> 00:35:44,319
Have you seen my partner?

841
00:35:44,319 --> 00:35:46,141
The guy that I was with
earlier on today?

842
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:47,516
No. Why?

843
00:35:47,516 --> 00:35:48,721
Because he left the house
a while ago,

844
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:49,887
and his truck
is still here.

845
00:35:49,887 --> 00:35:51,709
And he's not answering
his cell.

846
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:53,951
Oh. Weird.

847
00:35:58,642 --> 00:36:00,923
Weird. No, Ben and I have been
asleep for hours.

848
00:36:00,923 --> 00:36:02,287
Haven't seen anything.

849
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:04,280
Okay. Thank you.

850
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,983
I hope you find him.

851
00:36:16,192 --> 00:36:18,145
That was Nyla.

852
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:20,714
I really hope
she gets back with Don.

853
00:36:20,714 --> 00:36:23,045
We always had so much fun
with them.

854
00:36:23,045 --> 00:36:24,121
Remember?

855
00:36:35,247 --> 00:36:36,611
Ohh!

856
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,359
Ohh!

857
00:36:38,982 --> 00:36:42,219
Hey. Hey. You alright?

858
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:43,674
I gotcha. I gotcha.

859
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:54,172
How's John?

860
00:36:54,172 --> 00:36:57,449
Uh, he might need a couple
stitches and a Valium,

861
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,899
but, um, he'll be okay.

862
00:36:59,899 --> 00:37:01,513
I think it might be time
to move.

863
00:37:01,513 --> 00:37:02,887
This neighborhood's
a mess.

864
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:06,951
Benjamin and Griffin
were such a great couple.

865
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:08,774
But so were we
at one point in time.

866
00:37:08,774 --> 00:37:11,065
Oh, come on.
There's no comparison.

867
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:14,382
We had our dark days, sure, but
never a full psychotic break.

868
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:17,370
I don't know.
I got close a couple times.

869
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,029
