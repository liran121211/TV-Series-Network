1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,710
There he is.
7-Adam-07,
show us Code 6

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,620
on a suspected mail theft,
2210 Rosemont.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,830
Sir!

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,000
Are those your packages?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,750
Totally.
Where you taking them?

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,080
My mom's.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,750
You have an ID,
says you live here?

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,460
I forgot my wallet.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,290
How about opening the front door
to prove that's your house?

10
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,540
Uh, I-I locked my keys
inside.

11
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,290
But I can jump the fence
and I can get my hide-a-key.

12
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,210
Sir, put down the packages.
You're under arrest.

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,330
Oh, no, this is just gonna
take a second, bro.

14
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,880
Hey, hey! Stop!
Give it a second.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,000
Why?

16
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,120
"Beware of dog."

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,000
Easy!

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,080
No! No! N-No!

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,790
? Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
whoa, oh, oh ?

20
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,620
? I'm gonna win for you
like I know you want me to do ?

21
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,830
Get an ambulance!

22
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:58,080
Ooh! Looking sharp.

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,620
Thanks. I kind of missed
wearing a suit.

24
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,330
Liar.

25
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,790
First day back at work.
How you feeling?

26
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,380
I feel great.
Great.

27
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,880
Because the couch is getting
a you-shaped dent in it.

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,790
Time to get back in the game,
Counselor.

29
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,080
My mom always says "Today's
a great day for a great day."

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,420
You got this.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,460
? See it all ?

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,750
? Watch and learn ?

33
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,170
? Study the tape,
the game overturn ?

34
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,210
? Picking it up,
we on that vibe ?

35
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,710
Would somebody please tell me
the difference

36
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,670
between Greyhound
and Deep River?

37
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,830
Hey.
Can I help you?

38
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,420
Is Barbara here?

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,420
Oh, I'm sorry, I think
you have the wrong house.

40
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,290
No, this was my house.

41
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,210
Our house.

42
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,670
When Barbara and I
were married.

43
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,040
Howard Green.

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,920
Oh. John Nolan.
Yeah, I just, uh --

45
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,290
I just bought the place.
Wow. Looking good.

46
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,540
Barbara always said
the bones were special.

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,210
But we could never afford
to do any work.

48
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,750
You're fixing it up
yourself?

49
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,830
Yeah, I sure am.

50
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,210
And I don't mean to be rude,
but I do --

51
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,330
I have to get ready
for work.

52
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,420
Sure. Uh...

53
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,170
Sorry, uh,
to trouble you. Uh...

54
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,380
Everything okay, Howard?

55
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,920
Not really.

56
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,790
Five years ago, I walked out
that door and never came back.

57
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,120
Barbara gave me
an ultimatum --

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,500
my family
or the drugs.

59
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,580
Ohh.

60
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,580
That's rough.

61
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,330
I'm dying.

62
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,920
Brain cancer.

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,960
I just found out.

64
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,710
Maybe it's selfish,

65
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:43,290
but I want them to know
that I chose wrong

66
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,540
before I'm gone.

67
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:51,000
So i-i-if you know
where they are

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,790
or how I can, uh...

69
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,420
Howard, I'm so sorry.

70
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,750
I bought the house
in foreclosure from the bank.

71
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,620
I don't have
any contact information

72
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,580
for your family.

73
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,790
Okay.

74
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,920
Thank you for your time,
and, uh...

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,290
good luck
with the renovation.

76
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,790
Thank you.

77
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,040
I have to help him,
though, right?

78
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,960
That's karma 101 --
help the dying guy.

79
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,290
What?

80
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,790
Nothing. What's got you
a million miles away?

81
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,620
Nothing.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,460
Judge granted me an overnight
visit with Lila. Tomorrow night.

83
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,960
That's great.
You must be so happy.

84
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,120
If you equate
debilitating anxiety

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,250
with happiness,
then sure.

86
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,920
It's been six months
since I spent

87
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,500
more than a couple hours a week
with her.

88
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,670
It's just,
she's changed so much.

89
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,040
And you're afraid that you've
forgotten how to be a mom?

90
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,880
No.
Don't worry.

91
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,710
She's gonna be so excited
just to hang out with you.

92
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,830
You got her room
all set up?

93
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,170
Yeah,
I'm doing that tonight.

94
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,670
I have a stack of Swedish
furniture to assemble.

95
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,040
Well,
if you need a hand...

96
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,880
What, you think because
I'm a girl, I'm not handy?

97
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,790
Not what I said.
I just know how challenging

98
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,080
Allen wrench furniture
can be.

99
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,120
Fair point.

100
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
Harper. Just got a call
from a crime scene.

101
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,420
Some woman was assaulted
in her apartment.

102
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,210
They took her
to the hospital.
Okay.

103
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,120
Responding officer noticed
a framed photo

104
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,620
on the victim's bookshelf --
thought I should see it.

105
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,210
That's you, right?

106
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,210
Yeah.
In an undercover life.

107
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,000
Crystal?
Yeah.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,670
Who's the other lady?

109
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,290
It's Eva Ruiz.

110
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,080
We were tight
for a while.

111
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,080
I used her to get close
to some bad people.

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,750
Haven't seen her
in years.

113
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,000
Any word
on who beat her up?

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,120
No.
And she's not talking.

115
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,620
Is there any reason detectives
should proceed carefully

116
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,880
with their investigation?

117
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,210
No, sir.

118
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,920
Eva is squarely
in my rearview.

119
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,330
Okay.

120
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,580
You know, if you want,
we can drop by the hospital,

121
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,920
see how
your friend is doing.

122
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,790
She's not my friend.
She was a means to an end.

123
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,330
Then why are you upset?

124
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:08,380
Oh! Excuse me!
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.

125
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,670
I found this lost dog.

126
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,960
Aww.
Aren't you sweet.

127
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,750
Uh, but lost dogs are actually
an Animal Control issue.

128
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,290
Oh, of course.

129
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,080
But I figured all this blood
made it an LAPD issue.

130
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,250
There isn't a scratch
on her.

131
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,080
Where was she?
Middle
of Wilshire Boulevard.

132
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,000
Little cutie was frantic,
almost got herself squashed.

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,380
What's the holdup?

134
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,500
We need to swing
by a vet,

135
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,040
see if there's a chip
in this dog.

136
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,880
She could've come
from a crime scene.

137
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,960
Hey!

138
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,830
? Not to be confused
with none of these other dudes ?

139
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,620
? Following the leader when
they sent us off to school ?

140
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,290
? I rule, take a backseat,
run it like an athlete ?

141
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,330
? Looking like a lit match,
artists couldn't match me ?

142
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,670
You're under arrest.

143
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,000
Sir, you should stay
in your car.

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,670
That was sick.

145
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,830
Whoa.
You're Sterling Freeman.

146
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,540
Wh--
He's Sterling Freeman.

147
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,540
Who?

148
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,830
I'm an actor.

149
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,330
Good for you.
Are you kidding?

150
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,080
He's the star
of "Hot Suspect."

151
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,420
Sounds like a porno.

152
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,040
It's not, okay? It's the
highest-rated cop show on TV.

153
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,420
You watch it?
Oh, yeah.

154
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,460
I mean, every single week.
It's amazing.

155
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,540
It's all right.
It's nothing like the work

156
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,080
you do in the real world,
Officer...?

157
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,000
West. Jackson.

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,120
Jackson.

159
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,210
Well, good to meet you,
Jackson.

160
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,250
Maybe you could teach me
that slide sometime.

161
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,250
Sure. Yeah, I'd, uh --
I'd be happy to.

162
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,790
Let's go, Hollywood.

163
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,790
Eva was beaten
pretty savagely.

164
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,540
They broke her arm
and four ribs,

165
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,670
ruptured an eardrum.

166
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,620
Luckily, there were
no internal injuries.

167
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,080
Uh, she told detectives
she didn't remember the beating.

168
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,880
Is that possible?
Sure.

169
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,290
Although,
medically speaking,

170
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,170
I don't think there was enough
head trauma to explain that.

171
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,460
So she could be
lying.

172
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,210
That's more
your department.

173
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,580
You can go in and talk to her,
if you want.

174
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,460
No,
I can't blow my cover.

175
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,500
If my real identity got out,
it would put her in jeopardy.

176
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,080
How so?
She introduced me
to a lot of bad people.

177
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,330
They would think
she was a snitch

178
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,670
and they would kill her.

179
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,330
So that's it?
We just walk away?

180
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,960
Her attacker
gets away with it?

181
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,000
There is one person
she might talk to.

182
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,880
Does this place have
a lost and found?

183
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,040
Sgt. I hear you had
a brush with fame this morning.

184
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,750
Sterling Freeman?
Yes, sir.

185
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,080
Well, you must have made
an impression,

186
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,620
'cause Mr. Freeman called in
a favor with the Chief,

187
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,710
asked if you can come be
a technical advisor

188
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,540
on his show today.
Really?

189
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,330
He wants a rookie to tell him
how to be a pretend cop?

190
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,170
No wonder Hollywood
always gets it wrong.

191
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,790
Which is why
you're going with him.

192
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,250
And before you protest

193
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,920
that you'd rather clean
the drunk tank --

194
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,580
With my tongue.
I will let you work
10-hour shifts next week

195
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,040
if you could please
teach these actors

196
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,540
how to properly
clear a room --

197
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,000
or at least
use their radios.

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,290
Luna makes you watch.

199
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,750
Every week.

200
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,750
It's all I can do not to
punch my fist through the TV.

201
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,460
Just...please.

202
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,040
Copy that.

203
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,460
Never hung out
with a celebrity before.

204
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,080
You're lucky.

205
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,290
I might need you
to get...

206
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,580
I'll meet you in the shop.
Okay.

207
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,420
...a few of those to me
by the end of the day.

208
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,710
Whoa. Sorry.

209
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,580
No problem.
You just snuck up on me.

210
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,080
Um, I'll send the request when
I get back to the office, okay?

211
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,880
Thank you.

212
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,290
How's it going?

213
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,710
It's like I never left.

214
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,580
Why does that sound like
a bad thing?

215
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,170
No, it's fine.
I'm just...

216
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,710
trying to do what the doctor
said -- take things slow.

217
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,750
We still on for lunch?

218
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,290
I can't.

219
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,750
But I'll make it up to you
tonight.

220
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,170
Okay?
Okay.

221
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,670
Control, show us Code 6
at 819 Rivera.

222
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
Police!

223
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,790
We've got your dog.

224
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,380
Police.

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,330
Body.

226
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,330
Clear.

227
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,460
This is the police!
We're coming in,

228
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,790
so get your hands
where I can see 'em!

229
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,080
Hey, Malcolm.

230
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
That was
a great hiding spot.

231
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,120
You thought fast,
and you kept yourself safe.

232
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,750
Malcolm, can you tell me
who hurt your mom?

233
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,750
I'll be right back.

234
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,120
He's in shock. We got to get him
to the hospital,

235
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,960
make sure
it's not something worse.

236
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,210
Heard there might be
a witness.

237
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,500
Malcolm Tucker.
But he's unresponsive.

238
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,710
Mother was stabbed
at least a dozen times.

239
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,710
Not sure what he saw.

240
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,330
So a crime of passion.

241
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,040
Fits the history.

242
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,380
I ran a record search.

243
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,670
Between us and social services,
this house was visited

244
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,920
half a dozen times
in the last year.

245
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,170
Domestic strife
between the victim

246
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,380
and her boyfriend,
Carson Gomes.

247
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,460
I sent officers
to his house and jobsite.

248
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,920
Rachel was
the caseworker.

249
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,380
We're dating.

250
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,620
Well, good.
Give her a call.

251
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,120
Have her meet you
at the hospital,

252
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,500
and she can brief you
on the history in person.

253
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,210
There's bound to be something
she left out of her reports.

254
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,250
You're not coming?

255
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,670
No. I still got work
to do here first.

256
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,750
You guys
will fill me in after.

257
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,420
Yeah.
Okay.

258
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,170
You know...

259
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,830
as much as I love
a witness,

260
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,960
I just really hope
he didn't see anything.

261
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,040
Yeah.

262
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,250
So, what do we got?

263
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,710
Crystal?

264
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,880
In the flesh.

265
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,420
Um...

266
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,460
Uh...

267
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,170
Here.

268
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,250
You stole these.

269
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,330
Nah, I d-- I did not.

270
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,580
"To the best grandma ever"?

271
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,670
She's in a coma.
She will not miss them.

272
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,330
You're going
straight to hell.

273
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,120
I will save you a seat.

274
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,000
So, um...what happened?

275
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,580
Nuh-unh.

276
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,040
You first.

277
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
Where the hell you been?
You just ghosted me?

278
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,960
Look,
I hit a rough patch.

279
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,750
I had to skip out
a moment.

280
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,790
And you couldn't call?

281
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,620
I thought you were dead.

282
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,330
I was.

283
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,710
Just about.

284
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,880
For a while.

285
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,000
Look, I only been clean
a few months now,

286
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,790
and, um...

287
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,420
Look, I'm sorry. I-I didn't --
I didn't mean to scare you.

288
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,500
I heard you took a beating,
and so I, um...

289
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,120
I wanted
to come check on you.

290
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,880
Who did it?

291
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,670
Ripper.

292
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:17,210
He was entry level
when you were crashing with me.

293
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,290
Wilson used him
as a runner

294
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,040
at the stash house
in Montgomery.

295
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,170
Right.
He was that big kid.

296
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,420
He was always
playing with that knife.
Yeah.

297
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,710
Worked his way up the food chain
real fast after you left.

298
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,040
He thought
I was skimming off the take.

299
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,080
'Cause you were?

300
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,290
Not enough
to get stomped on like this.

301
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,080
Ripper's always been
Old Testament,

302
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,670
but I should've
known better.

303
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,580
Did you tell the cops?

304
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,790
What do you think?

305
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,170
Look,
the enemy of my enemy --

306
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,750
Will get me killed.

307
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,500
You are the same old Eva.

308
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,170
Damn straight.

309
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,120
And I don't need help
from nobody.

310
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,750
A'ight, I'm-a bounce,
but, um...

311
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,580
I will...
check on you later, so...

312
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,790
Don't bother.

313
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,290
You're still dead
as far as I'm concerned.

314
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,250
Um...

315
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,830
take care of yourself.

316
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,420
Dr. Lawrence, 5247.

317
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,750
How's Malcolm?

318
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,250
Uh, he's still in shock.

319
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,750
He's lucky
it wasn't a lot worse.

320
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,120
I can't believe
Julie's dead.

321
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,960
Did Carson do it?

322
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,580
We don't know yet.

323
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,080
Was he abusive?

324
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,710
Uh, not physically,
as far as I could tell.

325
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,040
He has a criminal record,

326
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,460
but honestly, Mom was
the eye of that storm.

327
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,920
I tried
to get Malcolm removed,

328
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,040
but I couldn't get a judge
to sign off.

329
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,670
What's gonna happen
to him now?

330
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,210
Well, once we get clearance
from the doctor,

331
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,210
we'll take him
down to the station.

332
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,290
We'll need to get
a statement.

333
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:47,790
I'll meet you.

334
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,790
I have to reach out to family,
see if anyone can take him

335
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,500
so he doesn't end up
in a group home.

336
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,790
Hey, Rachel.

337
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,120
You did what you could.

338
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,000
It wasn't enough.

339
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,250
I mean, I figured I could
at least run a record search,

340
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,170
you know,
try to find Howard's family.

341
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,710
When did he move out
of the house?

342
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,960
Five years ago.

343
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,330
I'm not sure how long
his family stayed after that.

344
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,540
Let me know
if I can help somehow.

345
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,080
I'm just, like, sitting around
at home tonight, so...

346
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,080
My ex took Oliver
on a camping trip.

347
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,620
He's gone all week.

348
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,170
I've never been away from him
that long,

349
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,790
and I'm, like,
climbing the walls a little.

350
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,540
Just -- It's too quiet,
you know?

351
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,580
Yeah, I know the feeling,
but you should embrace that.

352
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,380
Just go out,
have some fun.

353
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,670
I'm not familiar
with that term.

354
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,080
Let's go.
I got a name.

355
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,120
I-I-I -- Uh...
See you later.

356
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,830
I got to go.
But do have some fun.

357
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,170
In the name of the law.

358
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,960
Oh, my God.

359
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,290
Wow. "The Maltese Falcon"
was shot here.

360
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,960
So was "Cop Rock."

361
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,460
Jackson. Welcome.

362
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,120
Thank you so much
for taking the time to help out.

363
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,750
Yeah, happy to.

364
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,880
Where's catering?

365
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,040
Behind that set.

366
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,000
Should we wait
for her to come back?

367
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,290
I don't think
that's happening.

368
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,620
Okay.
So, where do we start?

369
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,120
Well, uh...

370
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,540
this is all wrong.

371
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,750
Yeah, the, uh, Taser
and the gun

372
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:20,080
should never be
on the same side.

373
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,380
Got to know
what you're going for.
Right.

374
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,920
Try to radio for help.
Uh...

375
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,580
Radio shouldn't be in back?
No.

376
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,830
See, I've been wearing this
for 36 episodes,

377
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,420
and this is why we needed
a technical advisor all along.

378
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,170
You know, I would love
for you to tell all this to Jim.

379
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,620
He's directing
this episode.

380
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,580
Does he know much
about police work?

381
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,080
Thinks he does.

382
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,790
Apparently, directing a handful
of procedurals

383
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,380
makes you an expert.

384
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,000
Wish I'd known.
I would've skipped the academy.

385
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,290
Sorry, this -- this food
isn't for background.

386
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,000
What?
Uh, extras eat
someplace else.

387
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,460
O-O-Or you can eat here.
I mean...

388
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,000
W-- W--

389
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,460
Any-- Anywhere.

390
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,040
You got a second?

391
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,080
Yeah. Sure.
Come on in.

392
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,960
Hey, um, you ever run across
a banger named Ripper

393
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,120
back at the 77?

394
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,540
Rings a bell.

395
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,210
He used to be a runner
for Wilson.

396
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,540
Now, that name,
I know.

397
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,500
Ran half the crystal meth
in Southern California

398
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,330
till somebody split him
up the middle.

399
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,880
You know,
let me check my records.

400
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,380
No comment.

401
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,750
I've been working this way
a long time.

402
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,290
Don't trust computers.

403
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,830
Ripper. Known to his mama
as Curtis Danvers.

404
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,120
What you into him on?

405
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,880
Uh, he beat up
someone I know.

406
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,170
Yeah, I know a couple of
detectives in my old gang unit

407
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,080
wouldn't mind talking to him
with a little leverage.

408
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,500
We don't have that.
Yet.

409
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,120
Victim won't testify --
won't even ID him to us.

410
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,920
Harper managed to get the name
by approaching her

411
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,080
in an old
undercover identity.

412
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,880
Grey approved that?

413
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,960
Never mind.
I didn't ask.

414
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,210
Look, I don't
have to tell you --

415
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,250
with no testimony,
you got no case.

416
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,170
Now, if you wanted
to go back undercover

417
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:55,420
and get him
to brag about it to you,

418
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,710
that'll hold up in court.

419
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,880
But to do that,
you gotta go to Grey.

420
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,330
It's a bad idea.

421
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,420
It's the only way
Ripper ends up in bracelets.

422
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,710
It's risking a lot

423
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:06,210
for someone you said
was just "a means to an end."

424
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,420
Says the guy trying
to locate the family of a rando

425
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,460
who showed up at his front door
with a sob story.

426
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,790
That's different.
I'm not judging you for
wanting to help Eva out.

427
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,380
What are you
judging me for?

428
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,380
For someone who gave up
undercover work,

429
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,580
you sure do it a lot.

430
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,960
When the situation
requires it.

431
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,790
The situation or you?

432
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,380
What, you think
I'm looking for an excuse
to go back undercover?

433
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,750
I think you're nervous
about your first overnight
with your daughter.

434
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,710
Oh, and this is
self-sabotage?

435
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,500
A little, yeah.

436
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,920
Look...

437
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,460
when my marriage
was on the rocks,

438
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,120
I hid at work.

439
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,250
I didn't want to do
the heavy lifting

440
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:38,710
it would take
to fix things,

441
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,620
and I can see why you'd want
to go down this road.

442
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,420
As dangerous as it is,
it's danger you're good at.

443
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,420
But this is how you lost your
daughter in the first place.

444
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,830
Yeah, I think I was pushing
the envelope with Harper,

445
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,710
but I really think
I got through to her.

446
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,080
Oh. Really?

447
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,710
Then why is she
in the roll call room

448
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,790
dressed as Crystal,
preparing an op?

449
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,880
And our CI will let us know
when the target's inbound.

450
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,540
Once he lands,
our UC will go in

451
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,290
and attempt
to get him talking.

452
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,290
And we're not traveling anywhere
with this guy. Are we clear?

453
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,580
Surveillance van will be set up
across the street here.

454
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,880
Don't say a word.

455
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,750
I wouldn't dream of it.

456
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,000
...here and here.

457
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,210
And, Officer Nolan,
as our uniformed presence,

458
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:37,710
we need you invisible,
until we don't.

459
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,420
So hang with us
until we call in for rescue.

460
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,120
Copy?
All due respect,

461
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,960
I'd like to stick
with my T.O.

462
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,540
I think being by her side
until go time

463
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,120
would be a valuable
learning experience.

464
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,540
Fine.
You'll go plainclothes.

465
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,040
But you don't make a move
without an order.

466
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,790
Yes, ma'am.
Can I have our UC
come to the front

467
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,620
so everyone can see
what she's wearing?

468
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,250
Get a good look, people.

469
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,460
If it goes sideways,
do not shoot this person.

470
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,080
Her trouble signs
will be hands up,

471
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,880
gun out,
or running away.

472
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,330
If you see her doing
any of these,

473
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,170
the op is down
and we send in rescue.

474
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,380
Rescue response time
is 30 seconds,

475
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,960
so for that long,
you're on your own.

476
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,330
Okay.

477
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,170
Unless any of you
have any questions,

478
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,080
let's head out.

479
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,540
Hey, listen, if you want to
stay behind, just say the word.

480
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:25,120
No way. You're my T.O.
I got your back no matter what.

481
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,880
You know, it'd be a lot easier
to hate you

482
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,250
if you weren't
so damn honorable.

483
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,380
I know.

484
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,580
Okay, go into your stance.

485
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,290
Okay.
Pull your weapon.

486
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,170
Not your real weapon --
your fake weapon. Put it away.
Okay.

487
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,710
All right, now look
at me for a signal, okay?

488
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,960
I'm gonna say
"LAPD. Open up."

489
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,170
I'm gonna kick it in.
You're gonna cross in.

490
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,290
Ready?
Yes.

491
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,000
LAPD. Open up!

492
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,960
Nice. Oh.

493
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,880
Sorry.
Sorry, ladies.

494
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,790
One more time.
Okay.

495
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,000
Hey.

496
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,500
I hear you're a real cop.

497
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,170
Yep.

498
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,750
I'm Mandy Cross.
I'm Sterling's co-star.

499
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,210
I was wondering
if I can ask you something.

500
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,420
Is this about a scene?

501
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,500
'Cause Officer West
is handling that crap.

502
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,580
O-Oh, no.

503
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,580
It's, uh...personal.

504
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,380
I think
I have a stalker.

505
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,210
And it's kind of
freaking me out.

506
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,380
Have you filed
a police report?

507
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,380
Not yet.

508
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,580
I just -- I don't know
if it's something I should
be worried about or not.

509
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,670
I have cards and letters
in my trailer.

510
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:21,670
Can I show them to you?

511
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,790
Sure. Let's go.

512
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,210
I started getting them
a few months ago.

513
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,920
All unsigned,
without a return address,

514
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,170
one every couple of days.

515
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,790
But in the last month,
they've been showing up daily.

516
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,460
Sometimes twice a day.

517
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,460
What do they say? Are there
any threats of violence?

518
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,620
No.

519
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,540
They're actually sweet.

520
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,170
In a disturbing way.

521
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,750
He's in love with me,

522
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,000
or he thinks I'm the greatest
actress he's ever seen.

523
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,460
Something else happened,
didn't it?

524
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,580
Yeah.

525
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,250
I think someone
broke into my house.

526
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,580
The other morning, I woke up,
and I saw my side door unlocked.

527
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,620
I could swear it was not
like that when I went to bed.

528
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,880
Did you call the police?

529
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,670
No.
I felt silly.

530
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,750
There was nothing missing.

531
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,710
I just...
got a weird feeling.

532
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,080
Unfortunately,
there's not a lot we can do

533
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,580
without a verifiable threat.

534
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,460
But you should definitely
take this seriously.

535
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,960
Get an alarm system,
try not to go to places alone,

536
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,830
and at the first threat,
call 911.

537
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,920
Okay.

538
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,500
I'm officially
freaking out now.

539
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Would you mind staying close
to me while you're here?

540
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,380
It'd make me feel better.

541
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,670
Of course.

542
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,500
I know this is painful.

543
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,120
I promise I'll make it
as quick as possible, okay?

544
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Okay.

545
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,000
Did you see
what happened?

546
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,920
They had a fight,
Mom and Carson.

547
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,670
About what?
Do you know?

548
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,880
Hey.

549
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,170
It's okay.
Take your time.

550
00:22:03,170 --> 00:22:04,500
About me.

551
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,540
Mom was mad 'cause I left out
the peanut butter.

552
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,620
She yelled at me,
sent me to my room.

553
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,670
But we were
supposed to play Xbox.

554
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,500
"We" who?

555
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,880
Me and Carson.

556
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,460
Carson was nice to me.

557
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,920
He spent time with me.

558
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,710
He yelled at her,
told her she was being a bitch.

559
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,000
She started screaming.

560
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,830
Had he ever hit her
before?

561
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,880
No. Never.

562
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,920
He's never hit her.

563
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,000
O-Okay.

564
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,460
Tell me more
about the fight.

565
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,540
Did you see it or --
or just hear it?

566
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,580
I heard it.
A door slammed.

567
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,960
My mom threw a plate.

568
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,210
She was so mad
when he left.

569
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,540
Uh...

570
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,710
When who left?
Carson?

571
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,540
Yeah.

572
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,790
Mm. I'm s--

573
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,170
And she was still alive?

574
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,170
Yeah.

575
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:55,330
Uh...

576
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,250
And -- And did Carson
come back?

577
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,080
No.

578
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,580
She chased him away.

579
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,830
Did anybody else come over?

580
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:05,750
Um, w-we should stop.

581
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,750
Rachel --
No.

582
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,250
Malcolm needs a lawyer.

583
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,040
Miss Hall, you don't have
standing to make that request.

584
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,670
Ask for a lawyer.
Rachel.

585
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,790
Miss Hall.

586
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,670
She's right.

587
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,080
Malcolm should have
a lawyer,

588
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,460
and we should want him
to have one.

589
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,710
It's your right, son.

590
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:29,000
Do you want a lawyer?

591
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,920
I guess so.

592
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,880
Officer Chen.

593
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,330
Would you take Malcolm
to the break room?

594
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,960
Yes, sir.

595
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,540
This way.

596
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:54,710
So, you got a lawyer in mind,
Miss Hall,

597
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,290
or are we calling
legal aid?

598
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,380
Is there a new ETA on Ripper
from the CI?

599
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,830
Not since the last time
you asked, five minutes ago.

600
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,120
That is so weird.

601
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,210
What?

602
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:15,380
That guy Howard
I told you about

603
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,920
who dropped by my place
this morning.

604
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,170
I did a records check
on his wife.

605
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,920
She seems to have dropped off
the face of the Earth

606
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,960
a couple years ago.

607
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,880
Okay.
What could that mean?

608
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,330
Maybe she got remarried,
changed her name legally.

609
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,380
The government doesn't
track names.

610
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,670
They track
Social Security numbers.

611
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,000
Maybe she stopped working?

612
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,500
Or maybe there's more to the
story than Howard's letting on.

613
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,960
I'd go with that.

614
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,880
Why are you still
pursuing this, anyway?

615
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,210
I told you -- good karma.

616
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,170
You know, you're nice,
but you're not that nice.

617
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,210
My dad walked out on us
when I was 10,

618
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,620
and my mom used to spin
these wild stories

619
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,750
about where he was.

620
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,750
But the moral
to all the stories was

621
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,080
"We're better off
without him."

622
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,080
And you didn't think so.

623
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:02,960
So you thought
you'd give Howard's family

624
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,500
the closure
that you never got.

625
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,750
Something like that.

626
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,790
I guess the universe
doesn't work like that.

627
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,330
No. It really doesn't.

628
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,380
That was the best scene
we have ever done on this show,

629
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,170
hands down --
all because of you.

630
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,830
So, can you come
every day, please?

631
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,670
No.

632
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,750
I had my watch commander
contact North Hollywood police.

633
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,250
They'll have a unit meet you
at your house

634
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,040
and then cruise by your place
every few hours.

635
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,580
Oh, thank you so much.

636
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,460
No problem.

637
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,830
Uh, maybe we can arrange
some sort of private training?

638
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,210
Sure. Yeah, I'd, uh -- I'd love
to train you on my off days.

639
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,750
Stay here.

640
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,670
Malcolm didn't do it.
He couldn't have.

641
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:54,670
I hope you're right.

642
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,670
But you think I'm wrong.

643
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,080
Wesley.
Thanks for coming.

644
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,960
Of course.
Where's my client?

645
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,710
Break room with Chen.

646
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:03,750
She's not
questioning him.

647
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,040
No.
She knows the rules.

648
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,420
I'm gonna go talk
to him.
Great.

649
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,790
You can't come with me.

650
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,540
I'm his advocate.

651
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,040
Rachel, you work for the county.
I work for Malcolm.

652
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,250
Sorry, but you're
on the outside now.

653
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,290
I'm guessing I'm on the outside
with you, too, huh?

654
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:21,460
Not with me personally.

655
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,330
He's just
a traumatized kid, Tim.

656
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,330
Yeah.

657
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,460
So, here's where we stand,
Malcolm.

658
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,460
You admitted
that you saw your mother

659
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,250
after her boyfriend, Carson,
left the house.

660
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,960
Did you get into a fight
with her, too?

661
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,580
You don't
have to answer that.

662
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,830
She said
she was done with him.

663
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,460
It wasn't fair.

664
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,960
Are you mad at me?

665
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,250
For insisting
on a lawyer?

666
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,750
You gave the kid time
to think, strategize,

667
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,250
get his story straight.

668
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,330
If he killed her
and we can't convict,

669
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,580
it's on you.

670
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,540
He's a child.

671
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,040
And kids
can't be monsters?

672
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:05,000
Hey.

673
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,960
How's he doing?

674
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,920
Wesley? Oh, he's fighting
the good fight.

675
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,500
You recognize this knife,
Malcolm?

676
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,670
You don't
have to answer that.

677
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,460
He's right. You don't.

678
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,250
But I think you want to.

679
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,920
I think the truth
is eating at you.

680
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,540
And you need
to let it out.

681
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,880
Do you recognize this?

682
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,920
It's from the kitchen.

683
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:40,290
Let's go back
to what we know, okay?

684
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:43,170
Carson leaves the house.
It's just you and your mother.

685
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,330
Then what?

686
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,040
She...left the room.

687
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,330
And I grabbed it.
The knife.

688
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,080
I picked it up
and followed her.

689
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,750
She was yelling
about how it was over.

690
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,790
Carson was gone.
We'd never see him again.

691
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,080
I started crying.

692
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,080
And she laughed at me.

693
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,880
She laughed at me.

694
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,920
What'd you do
to make her stop?

695
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,460
Malcolm --
I hit her with the knife.

696
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,540
You hit her
with the knife?

697
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,710
You mean you stabbed her?

698
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,330
Yeah? Where?

699
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,790
Her back.
Then what?

700
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,830
She turned to me.

701
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,120
Uh-huh.

702
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,460
Not even mad.

703
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,210
Like she didn't even
feel it.

704
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,620
Did she cry out?
Get an ambulance!

705
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,670
I guess so.
You guess so?

706
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,120
Which hand did you use?
Right.

707
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,250
How many times
did you stab her?

708
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,620
Okay, that's enough.
We're done for now, okay?

709
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,920
Do you need a break?

710
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,750
No. I just want it over.
Okay.

711
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,830
You stab her in the back.
She turns and looks at you.

712
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,380
Then what?

713
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,750
I stabbed her
again -- in the front.

714
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,420
And then I couldn't stop.

715
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,790
Wesley.

716
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,710
Baby, are you okay?
Mnh-mnh.

717
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,500
Just breathe.

718
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,540
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

719
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:15,790
What's going on?

720
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,460
I just need a minute.

721
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:23,080
Let's call it a night, okay?
It's late.

722
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,420
We'll get Malcolm squared away
in a juvenile facility.

723
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,170
It's okay.

724
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,420
It's okay.

725
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,670
Word is,
Ripper's not coming tonight.

726
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:42,710
Word could be wrong.

727
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,710
We should sit tight.

728
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,540
Detective.

729
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,380
Shift's over.

730
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,880
All right.
Let's call it.

731
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,290
But we are back here
first thing.

732
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,790
Howard?

733
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,460
Howard?
What are you doing here?

734
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,500
I put everything I had
into buying this house.

735
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,580
I drained my savings,

736
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,540
worked two jobs.

737
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,120
But they took it all
for granted.

738
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,670
They took me for granted.

739
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,880
The ingrates!

740
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,710
Howard...

741
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,170
you need help.

742
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,540
So we're gonna call someone
who can help you.

743
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,580
No!

744
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay. Okay.

745
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,120
We don't have to do that.

746
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,080
She said
they were afraid of me.

747
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,250
Me.

748
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,000
So afraid,
they went into hiding.

749
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,540
Where are they?

750
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,460
Come on, Howard.
Where are they?

751
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,080
I don't know
where your family is.

752
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,460
I don't even know
your family.

753
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,880
Where are they?!

754
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,250
Howard.

755
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,290
Easy. Easy. Easy.

756
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,540
Easy.

757
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,620
So, how did the bed building
go last night?

758
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,170
Pretty good.

759
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,000
Not sure if the bourbon
helped or hurt, but...

760
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,080
How's your, uh,
house crasher?

761
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,750
You heard about that?

762
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,960
When units go Code 3
to a cop's house,

763
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,500
they wake up the Chief.

764
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,250
Yeah. This is the part
where you say "I told you so."

765
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,790
Harper would say that.

766
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,040
But I'm Crystal.

767
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,330
Our forensic team
dusted your house for prints,

768
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,210
and Threat Management
went through all your
cards and letters.

769
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,330
Mostly what you expect --

770
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,750
an escalating pattern
of obsession.

771
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,620
But there were several
mentions of someone
"keeping you two apart."

772
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,120
Are you dating anyone?

773
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Only on TV.

774
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,290
? I get the feeling
I'm due me time ?

775
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,380
Knock, knock.
You're back.

776
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,580
Yeah, just until
the reinforcements arrive.

777
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,710
How's Mandy?

778
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,620
Safe, with my T.O.

779
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,880
Cool.

780
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,120
Yeah.

781
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,040
So, uh, what are you up to
this weekend?

782
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,920
The...private training thing.
Right.

783
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,750
Yeah, uh,
this weekend could work.

784
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,880
Great.

785
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,040
But also...
we should eat.

786
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,960
Can't learn
on an empty stomach.

787
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,040
? Please don't tell me lies ?

788
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,420
Right. Yeah.

789
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,790
And I...guess
since we have to eat anyway,

790
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,210
we...might as well
pick a nice spot.

791
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
Yeah.

792
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,420
And...

793
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,120
I have so much
to learn.

794
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,670
You have so much
to teach me.

795
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,880
We should probably
block out several hours.

796
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,000
All night, even.

797
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,080
? Ain't got to deal with
what I won't do, won't do ?

798
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,170
Come in.

799
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,380
Hey. Uh, they need him
on set?

800
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,250
Oh! Jackson!

801
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,330
You can't have her.

802
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,790
Wait. Wait.
She's mine!

803
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,580
Jackson!

804
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,250
Are you okay?

805
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,330
Jackson!

806
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,830
Vest caught it.

807
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,830
Thank God.

808
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,460
Are you okay?

809
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,040
Ow.

810
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,120
That hurt.

811
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,460
Look alive.
Ripper's here.

812
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,710
Test, test, 1, 2.

813
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,040
Good to go.

814
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,290
Uh, Harper.

815
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,000
You know,
you don't have to do this.

816
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,210
Relax, 5%.
This is what I do.

817
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,580
What do you want?

818
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,500
Ripper.

819
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:47,960
You know me.

820
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,250
No, I don't.
Get lost, junkie.

821
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,290
Dude, hey!
We used to hang out

822
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,330
at the stash house on Montgomery
back in the day.

823
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,250
Dude -- Crystal.

824
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,210
Long time.
Too true.

825
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,460
So, what do you want?

826
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,620
I hear you're the man now.

827
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,670
Now, look,
I-I'm down for anything.

828
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,460
Anything, huh?
Mm-hmm.

829
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,750
All right.

830
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,080
Come on.

831
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:28,670
? I am the least
of your problems ?

832
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:33,750
? But I don't mind ?

833
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,750
Who are your friends?

834
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,830
Trust me, you don't want
to know these guys.

835
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,670
Hey, uh...you used to hang
with Eva, right?

836
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,290
Yeah, for a minute.

837
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,960
Hmm.

838
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,420
Because she stole from me,
you know.

839
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,290
You here to steal
from me, too?

840
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,710
Look, I told you,
I-I haven't seen Eva in years.

841
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,080
Eh-- We -- We ended ugly.

842
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,920
We got to get in there.

843
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,380
We won't get there
in time. She's got to
get herself out of this.

844
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,170
You say she stole from you.
I'm gonna make her pay.
Rescue detail, stand by.

845
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,170
I'll cut her face off
with a razor.

846
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:23,380
You say the word.

847
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,670
? I am the least
of your problems ?

848
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,710
? But I... ?

849
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,500
You always were
hardcore.

850
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,750
Anyway, Eva already
caught her beating.

851
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:39,830
But since you're feeling
so generous,

852
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,790
I do have a job
you could help with.

853
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,290
Sure, sure. Anything.

854
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,710
Cool.
Let's take a ride.

855
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:51,710
What is she doing?
You said no traveling.

856
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,420
He's not giving her
a choice.

857
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,620
But her survival odds
go way down inside a car.

858
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:57,210
We roll in strong,
they'll just kill her.

859
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:59,000
What's wrong?
Don't you want to come?

860
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,250
Nah, nah. I'm cool.

861
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,290
Sarge, what do you want us
to do here?

862
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,830
Sarge.
Did Harper demonstrate
any of the trouble signs?

863
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,380
Negative,
but she was given orders

864
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,960
not to travel
with the subject.

865
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,290
Can you engage without further
jeopardizing her safety?

866
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:21,750
Negative.

867
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,960
Do I engage rescue?

868
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,540
Not yet.

869
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,960
But put a follow car on them
and stay alert.

870
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,830
Hey --
What are you doing?!

871
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,540
Whoa!

872
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,880
Where you goin'?!

873
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,620
Yo!
Don't touch the ride!

874
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:37,920
Crystal, you told me
to wait for you.

875
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,960
Where you goin'?

876
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,000
Yo,
you know this fool?

877
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,920
Uh, that's my old man.

878
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,210
"Old" is right.

879
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,670
Yo...walk away.

880
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,670
Yo, make me.

881
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,540
Crystal, let's go.

882
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,420
Let her out.

883
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,500
See you around.

884
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,040
You too.

885
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,750
You got a death wish,
Boot?

886
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,380
I get it from you.

887
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,960
? Uh! ?

888
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,380
Here.

889
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,710
? All so much
that it feels right ?

890
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:34,120
? All I'm making up,
but I can't lie ?

891
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,670
You want to talk
about anything?

892
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,620
? Well, I'm all ears ?

893
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,580
No.

894
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,210
? You're like a kiss and tell ?

895
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,500
We're gonna
get through this.

896
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,580
? Tell me what's on your mind ?

897
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,920
Yeah, I know.

898
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:53,500
? Oh, yeah, I got time ?

899
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,540
? Tell me what's on your mind ?

900
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,710
? What's on your mind ?

901
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,710
? Hey, hey ?

902
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,000
? Talk, talk, talk to me ?

903
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,790
? Talk, talk, talk to me ?

904
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,290
It's not your fault.

905
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,000
There has to be something
I could've done differently.

906
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,250
Tragedies happen,

907
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,920
no matter how hard
we try to stop them.

908
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,960
Doesn't mean you give up.

909
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,460
But you have to accept
the fact

910
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,880
that some things really are
out of our control.

911
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,580
All we can do is
cherish the small victories.

912
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,960
That was...
almost inspirational.

913
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,790
Well, stick around.

914
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,540
I'm full of surprises.

915
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:55,500
? Hmm, hmm, yeah ?

916
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,290
? Hey ?

917
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,790
You're -- He's --

918
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,290
Yeah, way to
not make it weird.

919
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,620
Yeah, Sterling,
this is Lucy.

920
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,620
Lucy.
So nice to meet you.

921
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:11,210
Yeah. H-Hi.

922
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,710
Would you like
some wine?
Yes!

923
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:14,380
Jackson was just telling me
how awesome you are.

924
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,330
Hmm. Well,
that -- that is true.

925
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,170
Get a glass. Come on.

926
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,750
Okay.

927
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,170
Thank you.

928
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,710
? Tell me
what's on your mind ?

929
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,960
? Oh, yeah, I got time ?

930
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,210
So?
What do you think?

931
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,880
? Yeah,
talk, talk, talk to me ?

932
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,330
It's awesome.

933
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:36,920
? Talk, talk, talk to me ?

934
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,790
Uh...

935
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,670
How about we...
read a book?

936
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:45,710
Okay.

937
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,120
Let's see.

938
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,880
Chapter one --

939
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,540
Oh, my God!

940
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,080
Ah, Grace!

941
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,420
Hey!
What are you doing here?

942
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,540
Well, there is a new
photography exhibit at LACMA.

943
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:11,290
There is a midnight showing
of "Candyman"

944
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:13,330
on a rooftop
in Koreatown.
Whoa.

945
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,000
And there is an Armenian
festival in Echo Park.

946
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,380
I got you a ticket
to all three.

947
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,250
You're gonna find fun at
at least one of them.

948
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:22,000
That is very sweet.
I agree.

949
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,920
But I don't want
to go alone.

950
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,500
I'm so glad
you said that.

951
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,500
I say we start at the Armenian
festival for some fasulye,

952
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,540
we hit the exhibit, wrap it up
with the midnight show.

953
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,620
Isn't that
a little ambitious?
Not at all!

954
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,250
It's actually...
super ambitious.

955
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,500
So, really, we should go.

956
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,830
Okay.

957
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,380
Lead the way.
Excellent.

958
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,120
Is -- Is this a date?

959
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,670
Uh...

960
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,290
well, do we
have to name it?

961
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,710
No.

962
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,250
I-I guess we don't.

963
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,500
Good.

964
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,580
? Tell me what's on your mind ?

965
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,580
What the hell
is fasulye?

966
