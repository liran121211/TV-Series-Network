1
00:00:01,496 --> 00:00:05,020
7-Adam-15, show us
Code 6 at Shaw Memorial.

2
00:00:05,022 --> 00:00:06,112
What's going on?

3
00:00:06,114 --> 00:00:07,800
A guy came into the ER intoxicated,

4
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:08,868
complaining of stomach pain.

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:11,637
He's clearly been shot
but insisting he's not.

6
00:00:14,075 --> 00:00:15,975
Sir. I hear you're
having a little trouble.

7
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:19,813
Uh, no, just, um, ate some bad sushi.

8
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:21,580
- What's your name?
- Arnold.

9
00:00:21,582 --> 00:00:22,748
Arnold what?

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,517
I-I don't have to tell you that.

11
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,352
Hey, why... why'd you call them?

12
00:00:26,354 --> 00:00:27,653
Sir, she's required by law

13
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:29,088
to call us when a patient's been shot.

14
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,690
I told you, I ain't been shot.

15
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:33,492
Just too much gas station sushi.

16
00:00:33,494 --> 00:00:34,760
Well, unless the wasabi

17
00:00:34,762 --> 00:00:36,529
burned a hole straight
through your stomach,

18
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,930
I'm forced to assume you're lying to us.

19
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:39,832
So, how about you tell
us what really happened?

20
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:41,590
Um...

21
00:00:41,592 --> 00:00:43,382
Uh...

22
00:00:43,384 --> 00:00:45,004
He did it!

23
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:47,874
That's my husband. What... Excuse me.

24
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:49,675
What's going on? Why are you here?

25
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,783
Nolan! Hey!

26
00:00:58,019 --> 00:01:00,387
Hey, hey, hey!

27
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:03,889
Aah! Hey! Careful, man.

28
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:05,447
I been shot!

29
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:06,938
You gonna run away again?

30
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,730
- No.
- You got him?

31
00:01:08,732 --> 00:01:10,496
Aah!

32
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:11,864
Get him an IV antibiotic,

33
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:14,667
and add 5 milligrams of lorazepam.

34
00:01:14,669 --> 00:01:16,068
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, no, yeah, fine.

35
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:18,037
No, I just... I was...
I got, uh, distracted.

36
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,473
Oh, by what?

37
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,376
Simon, this is Nyla Harper

38
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:25,979
and... John Nolan.

39
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:29,482
Uh, nice to meet you, Officers.

40
00:01:29,484 --> 00:01:30,716
You must spend a lot of time here.

41
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:31,917
Oh, he's here all the time.

42
00:01:31,919 --> 00:01:33,586
Get... Got... Well, the criminals

43
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:37,156
and the injury... it's constant stuff.

44
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:39,925
Oh. W-Well, it's nice to meet you both.

45
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:45,898
Hey.

46
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,656
Dispatch said you got a gunshot victim.

47
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:48,680
Yeah, he belong to you?

48
00:01:48,682 --> 00:01:50,069
Unfortunately, yeah.

49
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:51,203
Guy ate all the sushi

50
00:01:51,205 --> 00:01:53,172
at a gas station on Melrose and Fairfax

51
00:01:53,174 --> 00:01:54,607
and refused to pay.

52
00:01:54,609 --> 00:01:56,575
Things got heated. The owner shot him.

53
00:01:56,577 --> 00:01:58,611
Who's the dude close-talking with Grace?

54
00:01:58,613 --> 00:01:59,945
That's her husband.

55
00:01:59,947 --> 00:02:01,514
I thought she was divorced.

56
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:02,516
Not technically.

57
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:05,050
What?

58
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:06,175
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

59
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:19,765
I forgot my deodorant again.

60
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:21,801
Here. Use mine.

61
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:23,569
Oh.

62
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:25,591
I do love a manly musk.

63
00:02:25,593 --> 00:02:27,460
Just not on me.

64
00:02:27,462 --> 00:02:30,263
You're gonna have to start
leaving some things here.

65
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:31,464
Yeah?

66
00:02:31,466 --> 00:02:32,531
Yeah.

67
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:36,035
What?

68
00:02:36,037 --> 00:02:37,102
Nothing.

69
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:39,473
You know it's illegal to lie to a cop.

70
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:42,775
Last week,

71
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:47,580
I interviewed for my dream job and...

72
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:49,282
I got it.

73
00:02:49,284 --> 00:02:52,051
Hey, hey! That's great!

74
00:02:52,053 --> 00:02:53,887
It's in New York.

75
00:02:54,956 --> 00:02:56,455
Oh.

76
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:57,890
Yeah.

77
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:04,463
Well, I s... I mean,
y-you have to take it.

78
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:06,999
Dream jobs only come around once.

79
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:08,934
Yeah, I know.

80
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:13,939
When do you start?

81
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,575
Next month.

82
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:20,514
They have cops in New York.

83
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,751
Yeah.

84
00:03:28,089 --> 00:03:30,423
Do you know where you're gonna live?

85
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:33,659
Not yet.

86
00:03:33,661 --> 00:03:35,428
Maybe you could, um,

87
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,097
help me target some
neighborhoods tonight.

88
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,334
Yeah.

89
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:42,501
Sure.

90
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:45,248
We're skipping roll call today.

91
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,839
Grey's got us on special assignment.

92
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:49,342
- Sounds cool and mysterious.
- Negative.

93
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:51,344
We will be escorting
some juvenile felons

94
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:53,979
through a Scared Straight
program at Cal Correctional.

95
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:55,981
Oh, and let me guess...
you'd rather be on the streets

96
00:03:55,983 --> 00:03:57,783
- chasing real criminals.
- Yep.

97
00:03:57,785 --> 00:03:59,518
I've been to these things before.

98
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,730
It's a lot of chaos and noise...
and the jury's still out

99
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:03,162
as to whether it actually
makes a difference.

100
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:05,324
Well, if it helps even one
kid, it's made a difference.

101
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,128
This is... I...

102
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,696
Meet me at the Sally Port.

103
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:12,798
Thank you.

104
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,467
Hey, you. How you doing?

105
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:15,568
Not great.

106
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,470
Oliver is in some trouble at school.

107
00:04:17,472 --> 00:04:19,038
That's why Simon was here yesterday.

108
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,206
Sorry to hear that.

109
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,475
- ICU Nurse Adams to recovery.
- Thanks.

110
00:04:22,477 --> 00:04:23,576
You know, and I'm sorry

111
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:26,579
that it was awkward meeting my ex.

112
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:28,414
You know, it just didn't feel
like the right time or place

113
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,015
to introduce you as my boyfriend.

114
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:31,851
- I understand.
- I knew you would.

115
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,486
Like I know you'll understand

116
00:04:33,488 --> 00:04:36,589
that I need to reschedule
dinner tonight.

117
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:38,390
I think Simon and I have got
to get on the same page

118
00:04:38,392 --> 00:04:39,892
about how to handle Oliver.

119
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:41,560
Over dinner?

120
00:04:41,562 --> 00:04:45,064
I mean, it's the only
time he can get off work.

121
00:04:45,066 --> 00:04:46,866
Yeah, right. Of... Of course, yeah.

122
00:04:46,868 --> 00:04:48,934
And family comes first.

123
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:52,071
Um, I have to go right now,
but I will talk to you later.

124
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:53,739
You got a problem.

125
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:56,075
- Both of us?
- No, just you.

126
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:57,576
In the attempt to combat

127
00:04:57,578 --> 00:04:59,578
the high cost of civil litigation,

128
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,448
the LAPD has adopted a pilot program

129
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,916
which uses an algorithm

130
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,052
to target officers who are
most likely to get sued.

131
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:08,344
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

132
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:10,055
They hired a tech company

133
00:05:10,057 --> 00:05:12,591
run by a supposed genius...

134
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:13,692
Elvis Grimaldi.

135
00:05:13,694 --> 00:05:16,028
All due respect, why do we
care what this dude thinks?

136
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:17,730
Because he flagged you

137
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:20,599
as the most problematic
officer in this station,

138
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:21,867
and he's got the Chief's ear.

139
00:05:21,869 --> 00:05:23,702
Come on, Sarge. I just
got the tap for detective.

140
00:05:23,704 --> 00:05:25,704
I'll get passed over
if this guy dings me.

141
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:29,041
Which is why I got him to
agree to spend a day with you,

142
00:05:29,043 --> 00:05:32,211
collect more data for his "algorithm".

143
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:35,250
So you are going to show him

144
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,484
you are a by-the-book cop
with love in her heart.

145
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:40,038
Take only the tame calls,

146
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,908
and give him the answers
he wants to hear.

147
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:46,158
You might just skate through this thing.

148
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,127
Alright, line up. Against the van.

149
00:05:50,131 --> 00:05:54,033
Marco Leland... assault and battery.

150
00:05:54,035 --> 00:05:55,134
Tyson Renner...

151
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:56,168
Hey, unh-unh.

152
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,604
Up. Off the van. Stand up straight.

153
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:00,973
Tyson Renner... vandalism.

154
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:02,641
Fletcher Perry... auto...

155
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:05,177
Auto theft. That turn you on, baby?

156
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:07,813
Nothing like getting hit on
by a 12-year-old delinquent

157
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:08,981
to get your day started.

158
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:10,249
Hey, yo, I'm 15.

159
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:11,684
Not better.

160
00:06:11,686 --> 00:06:13,586
What about you? What's your story?

161
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:16,288
Okay, good talk.

162
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,976
Hector Duran, 17.

163
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:21,260
Spent three months in juvie
for theft and drug possession.

164
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:24,418
Okay. I'm Officer Nolan.
This is Detective Harper.

165
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,987
Together, we're gonna be
taking a little field trip

166
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:28,634
down to the California
Correctional Facility.

167
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:30,603
For those of you who
complete today's program,

168
00:06:30,605 --> 00:06:32,671
the rest of your sentences
will be commuted.

169
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:34,006
But this is your last chance.

170
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:36,370
Get busted again, and
the prison we are going to

171
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:37,843
will become your new home.

172
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:38,866
Fine by me.

173
00:06:38,868 --> 00:06:40,112
Really? You ever been there?

174
00:06:40,114 --> 00:06:41,137
Hell yeah.

175
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,681
My brother's doing a bid up there.

176
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:44,117
Not something to be proud of.

177
00:06:45,786 --> 00:06:47,720
Alright. Road trip time.

178
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:51,023
So, I made some calls.

179
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:52,859
This Grimaldi guy made a fortune

180
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:54,326
on a dating app that he sold to Google.

181
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:56,016
Claims his algorithm is so good

182
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:57,393
that it can predict compatibility

183
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:58,898
with a 90% success rate.

184
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,999
Bull.

185
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:03,168
Maybe. But rumor is Bieber
used it to land Hailey.

186
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:05,037
I don't know who those people are.

187
00:07:06,207 --> 00:07:08,808
You the brain messing
with my livelihood?

188
00:07:09,644 --> 00:07:11,677
Mr. Grimaldi, I am Officer West.

189
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,812
This is my training
officer, Officer Lopez.

190
00:07:13,814 --> 00:07:16,348
Call me Elvis. Mr. Grimaldi are my dads.

191
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:18,050
You don't look as
dangerous as I anticipated.

192
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:19,285
And you don't look as smart.

193
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:22,154
Yeah, think I'm gonna go.

194
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:23,430
You, um... You'll lose out

195
00:07:23,432 --> 00:07:25,357
on gathering more data
points for your algorithm,

196
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:28,193
and that'll delay exiting
the beta phase by weeks.

197
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:29,762
You understand about beta phases.

198
00:07:29,764 --> 00:07:30,863
Yes, sir.

199
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:33,198
Officer Lopez taught me.

200
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,235
Okay, I'm back in. Data uber alles.

201
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:37,670
But, Officer Lopez, you should know

202
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:38,837
that negativity towards me

203
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,397
will only strengthen the core data draw

204
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,159
that landed you the top
spot on the naughty list.

205
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,876
I'll take that under advisement.

206
00:07:43,878 --> 00:07:45,611
Excellent. Shall we?

207
00:07:48,683 --> 00:07:50,317
Rachel told me about New York.

208
00:07:51,752 --> 00:07:53,218
I'm happy for her.

209
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,587
What are you guys gonna do?

210
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,221
There's not much to do.

211
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:58,484
You know, it's... it's not
like it's a semester abroad.

212
00:07:58,486 --> 00:07:59,753
It's permanent.

213
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:03,196
Long-distance relationships never work.

214
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,032
Thanks for coming.

215
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:08,801
Of course. What do you got?

216
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:11,203
Uh, Social Services has
been here a few times

217
00:08:11,205 --> 00:08:12,304
on truancy calls.

218
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:14,106
Paul hasn't been to
school in the last month

219
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,241
due to an undefined illness,

220
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:19,304
and the mom recently started a GoFundMe

221
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:20,312
to cover the medical bills.

222
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:22,414
Right. You think she's running a scam?

223
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:24,249
Well, scams are your jurisdiction.

224
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:26,118
I'm just here to make
sure the kid's okay.

225
00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:29,655
Hello, Ms. Mint?

226
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:31,123
Hi, I'm Rachel Hall

227
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,092
with the Department
of Child and Family Services.

228
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:34,627
Uh, is this about the truancy?

229
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:37,763
Yes. We just have a few
questions for you and your son.

230
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:38,964
Uh, I'm... I'm sorry.

231
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:40,666
It's not really a good
time. Paul's asleep.

232
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:44,403
I understand, but my job
is to make sure he's okay.

233
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:46,895
And I'm not leaving until I see him.

234
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:47,919
I-I...

235
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:49,241
Step aside, ma'am.

236
00:08:49,243 --> 00:08:51,410
I have a radio interview in 20 minutes.

237
00:08:51,412 --> 00:08:53,780
We'll be out of your way in 10.

238
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:02,988
Paul? Honey?

239
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,156
This is Rachel.

240
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:07,026
She needs to talk to you, okay?

241
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:09,696
Hi, Paul.

242
00:09:12,767 --> 00:09:15,000
Have you been to the doctor?

243
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:16,503
He's been in and out of the hospital

244
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:18,837
for the last three months.

245
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,139
What's the diagnosis?

246
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:22,174
"Results inconclusive",

247
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:26,011
which is doctor for "We have no idea".

248
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:27,446
Pulse is racing.

249
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:30,950
Hey, Paul, can you squeeze my hand?

250
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:36,722
They released him like this?

251
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:39,191
No, he was better.

252
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:40,325
It's always the same.

253
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,646
He improves at the hospital,

254
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,524
but after a couple days
at home, he's back to this.

255
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:45,215
How am I supposed to send him to school?

256
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,965
He can't even sit up.

257
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:48,734
I understand.

258
00:09:48,736 --> 00:09:51,236
We'll be out of your
hair in just a minute.

259
00:09:56,377 --> 00:09:59,044
So, what do you think?
It's Munchausen by proxy?

260
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,013
She meets the criteria.

261
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:03,629
Attention-seeking, undiagnosable illness

262
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:05,691
that gets better when
he's under observation.

263
00:10:05,693 --> 00:10:06,785
It's just so wrong

264
00:10:06,787 --> 00:10:09,956
that a parent would poison
their own child for attention.

265
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:12,391
Alright, what do you want to do?

266
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:18,230
$80,742,000.

267
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:20,365
That how much you made
off your dating app?

268
00:10:20,367 --> 00:10:22,034
Oh, God, no. I made 10 times that.

269
00:10:22,036 --> 00:10:23,902
The $80 million is
how much the LAPD paid

270
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:25,237
in legal settlements this year.

271
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,839
That's up 3.25%,

272
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:29,241
which is why they hired me
to target officers like you.

273
00:10:29,243 --> 00:10:31,343
You can't predict behavior with math.

274
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:33,011
It's literally what I do.

275
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:34,246
Policing is different.

276
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:35,848
- I disagree.
- Of course you do.

277
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,737
I find the whole subject fascinating.

278
00:10:37,739 --> 00:10:40,085
Uh, love to pick your brain.

279
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:42,193
If you're such an expert
on human behavior,

280
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:43,654
tell me how today's going to go.

281
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:46,699
Easy. We're gonna drive
around for a few hours,

282
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,327
taking only the tamest calls in town

283
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:50,595
while your partner attempts
to smooth over your rough edges

284
00:10:50,597 --> 00:10:54,133
and convince me that, deep down,
you really are a sweetheart.

285
00:10:54,135 --> 00:10:55,300
Wrong.

286
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:56,591
Today, I attached us

287
00:10:56,593 --> 00:10:58,529
to a high-risk warrant
service in Highland Park.

288
00:10:58,531 --> 00:11:00,572
Got you a bulletproof
vest in extra small.

289
00:11:00,574 --> 00:11:02,074
Only way to show you I'm a good cop

290
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:04,409
is to show you I'm a good cop.

291
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,954
Why does motor pool always
give us vehicles with no gas?

292
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:17,189
Payback.

293
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:18,290
Before you were my T.O.,

294
00:11:18,292 --> 00:11:19,992
I had an unintentional propensity

295
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:22,028
for crashing police cars.

296
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:25,297
Who needs the restroom?

297
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:26,299
Come on.

298
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,304
Alright, you guys. Who
wants some snacks? My treat.

299
00:11:32,306 --> 00:11:33,839
Yeah. Beer?

300
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:34,908
That's a no. Hector?

301
00:11:35,943 --> 00:11:38,243
Another no. Here, guys.
Grab whatever you need.

302
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:40,479
You two, over there. Now!

303
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:42,749
You, over here.

304
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:47,085
What are you doing?

305
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:48,520
I'm buying them snacks.

306
00:11:48,522 --> 00:11:50,122
But you're about to tell
me I'm being too nice?

307
00:11:50,124 --> 00:11:51,790
They're not Boy Scouts.
They're criminals.

308
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:53,492
I know you like to think I'm naive

309
00:11:53,494 --> 00:11:55,961
because I tend to see
the good in people,

310
00:11:55,963 --> 00:11:57,596
but that's just laziness on your part.

311
00:11:57,598 --> 00:11:59,531
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

312
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:03,324
And I think you'd be surprised
to see the difference it makes

313
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:05,204
when you show kids a
little bit of respect.

314
00:12:08,008 --> 00:12:10,210
You were saying?

315
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,797
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa! Hector, let him go.

316
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:20,277
Nah, I'm not adding time to my sentence

317
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,146
because this fool decided
to boost his street cred

318
00:12:22,148 --> 00:12:23,214
by stealing a police ride.

319
00:12:23,216 --> 00:12:25,049
- No!
- Relax. You did good.

320
00:12:25,051 --> 00:12:26,617
Let him go.

321
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:30,788
Easy. Fletcher! Hey, hey, hey!

322
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,723
Knock it off. Come on, Fletcher.

323
00:12:32,725 --> 00:12:34,058
- What?
- Hands against the side of the car.

324
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,226
Let's go.

325
00:12:35,228 --> 00:12:37,128
You dummy.

326
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,496
Wasn't very smart.

327
00:12:38,498 --> 00:12:40,164
Now you're going back to juvie.

328
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:41,188
It was worth it.

329
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,200
- Everything Code 4?
- Yeah.

330
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:44,969
Hector here stepped up
and did the right thing.

331
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:46,671
- I didn't do it for you.
- Doesn't matter, Hector.

332
00:12:46,673 --> 00:12:48,038
The right thing is the right thing.

333
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,173
- Is he for real?
- Yep.

334
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:53,677
Control, 7-Adam-15 requesting
juvenile transportation.

335
00:12:59,318 --> 00:13:00,651
Think there's any chance

336
00:13:00,653 --> 00:13:02,776
Tim would come to New York?

337
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:05,322
I don't know.

338
00:13:05,324 --> 00:13:08,058
I mean, he's L.A. pride born and bred,

339
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,161
but he is crazy about you, so...

340
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:11,518
You have no clue.

341
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,609
The man's a mystery.

342
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:14,067
What are they doing here?

343
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:16,125
They're here to take
Paul back to the hospital.

344
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:18,343
So the doctors can shrug
and say "Sorry, ma'am"

345
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:20,278
to the tune of $10,000 a day?

346
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,680
I'm afraid this is not a discussion.

347
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:23,015
To hell it's not. I am his mother.

348
00:13:23,017 --> 00:13:25,817
Look, I believe you are
a danger to your child.

349
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:28,353
Therefore, I'm removing
him from your care,

350
00:13:28,355 --> 00:13:29,521
pending a full investigation.

351
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:30,622
No, you can't do that!

352
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:31,757
- Ma'am, ma'am.
- You can't do that! No!

353
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,924
- Ma'am, come over here, please.
- You can't do that.

354
00:13:32,926 --> 00:13:35,762
No, please. What are you doing?

355
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:39,922
I just want to put it out there

356
00:13:39,924 --> 00:13:41,290
that you're completely disobeying

357
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:42,691
a direct order from the Watch Commander.

358
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:43,992
Grey just wants me to play nice,

359
00:13:43,994 --> 00:13:45,427
but how I act isn't going to matter

360
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:46,995
to a geek who only looks at numbers.

361
00:13:46,997 --> 00:13:48,764
I need to convince him that there's data

362
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,422
that he's not factoring
into his algorithm.

363
00:13:50,424 --> 00:13:51,513
And if he gets caught in the crossfire?

364
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:52,701
Problem solved.

365
00:13:57,607 --> 00:13:59,730
Do exactly as I and the other
officers say at all times.

366
00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:00,820
- Got it?
- Got it.

367
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:02,011
Morning. Who's this?

368
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:03,035
Uh, Elvis.

369
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:05,444
I run a risk evaluation
program for the LAPD.

370
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:07,616
Huh. Well, you in the right place.

371
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:09,685
Serving a warrant on the Jacobs Brothers

372
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:11,812
is like playing chicken
with a runaway train.

373
00:14:11,814 --> 00:14:13,113
That's on fire.

374
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:15,339
And filled with zombies.

375
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:16,363
Steagald warrant?

376
00:14:16,365 --> 00:14:18,452
Even better... "no knock".

377
00:14:18,454 --> 00:14:20,621
That's why Detective
Armstrong's my favorite.

378
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:21,855
- Nick Armstrong?
- Yeah. Why?

379
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:23,457
My algorithm has you pinpointed

380
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,559
as the highest-performing
detective in the station.

381
00:14:25,561 --> 00:14:26,660
An exemplary officer.

382
00:14:26,662 --> 00:14:29,063
"Exemplary".

383
00:14:29,065 --> 00:14:31,398
Let's catch some bad guys.

384
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:38,172
Get on your knees! Hands up!

385
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:39,206
LAPD! On the ground now!

386
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:40,674
- On your knees!
- Now! Hands on your head!

387
00:14:40,676 --> 00:14:42,042
Hands behind your back now!

388
00:14:43,546 --> 00:14:45,546
This ain't right! You surprised us!

389
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:47,715
- Code 4. Suspects in custody.
- Sit down.

390
00:14:52,188 --> 00:14:54,421
Want to hear some real
predictive analysis, Elvis?

391
00:14:54,423 --> 00:14:55,710
Ok... Yeah, okay.

392
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:58,649
The suspect has begun to
show pre-assault indicators.

393
00:14:58,651 --> 00:15:00,226
Hey, nobody told you to stand up.

394
00:15:00,228 --> 00:15:01,729
Sit your ass back down. Now.

395
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:04,157
Bladed stance. Rocking and bobbing.

396
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,490
It means adrenaline
and oxygen are pumping.

397
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:07,568
So you watch his eyes.

398
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:10,671
Once they lock, it's go time.

399
00:15:10,673 --> 00:15:12,773
- Aah!
- Hyah!

400
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:15,776
And that is why Officer
Lopez is my favorite.

401
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:16,877
Get up, dummy.

402
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,102
And that was a completely
justified use of force,

403
00:15:19,104 --> 00:15:20,126
by the way.

404
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,188
The law says she doesn't have to wait

405
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,850
for the suspect to
attack to defend herself.

406
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,752
Okay. Uh, tell me more about that.

407
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:43,203
It's natural to feel nervous.

408
00:15:43,205 --> 00:15:45,540
This ain't nothing.

409
00:15:47,243 --> 00:15:49,109
Welcome to Cal Correctional, Officers.

410
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:51,545
Please hand over your duty
belts and backup pieces.

411
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:53,947
They'll be secured in a locker here.

412
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:55,649
Thought you were bringing
me four young men.

413
00:15:55,651 --> 00:15:57,785
Uh, one of them flamed
out before we got here.

414
00:15:57,787 --> 00:15:59,787
Sounds like I'll be meeting
him soon enough.

415
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:01,789
You three, face the fence.

416
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,957
You are now in my custody.

417
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,959
You will obey every order I give,

418
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:08,729
or I will put hands on you
and I will make you obey.

419
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,831
You ball up your fist, I'll take
that as a sign of aggression

420
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,933
and I will put you on the
ground and I will handcuff you.

421
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,668
Is that clear?

422
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,769
Is that clear?!

423
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:17,604
Yes, sir.

424
00:16:17,606 --> 00:16:19,506
Let's move.

425
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:27,421
Detective Harper, Officer Nolan.

426
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:28,816
I'm Warden Miller.

427
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:30,651
Have you been through
this program before?

428
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:31,675
I haven't, no.

429
00:16:31,677 --> 00:16:32,820
Well, it can be intense.

430
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:34,121
Do you have children of your own?

431
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,756
I have a son who's 19.

432
00:16:35,758 --> 00:16:37,491
Then this is gonna be hard to watch.

433
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:50,138
Take a seat.

434
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,596
Are you deaf?

435
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,353
- I gave you an order.
- Man, get off of me.

436
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,948
I told you... you don't
listen, I make you listen.

437
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,951
Now sit your ass down.

438
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,687
Okay, bring 'em in.

439
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:14,294
Hey! I know you.

440
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:15,796
You've got to be kidding me.

441
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:16,964
You know Oscar?

442
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:19,800
I apprehended him twice during
multiple escape attempts.

443
00:17:19,802 --> 00:17:21,835
On one of those attempts,
he stabbed my friend.

444
00:17:21,837 --> 00:17:24,705
I can't imagine he has anything
useful to say to these kids.

445
00:17:24,707 --> 00:17:27,040
Yeah, well, he's not here
to say anything useful.

446
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:29,009
He's here because he's the monster

447
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:30,711
that they'll be locked up with.

448
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:34,047
And Mr. Caine here
joined us 11 years ago,

449
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:36,183
after he was convicted
of a double homicide.

450
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:38,352
Oh, come on, Warden.
Give him some credit.

451
00:17:38,354 --> 00:17:40,654
Caine tore the arm off of a guy

452
00:17:40,656 --> 00:17:42,656
that he caught his wife
cheating on him with.

453
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:44,558
He beat them both to death with it.

454
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,727
Not sure it's a good idea
to remind him of that.

455
00:17:46,729 --> 00:17:49,196
No, but it sure is fun.

456
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:50,832
Mm.

457
00:17:53,235 --> 00:17:55,202
Yeah.

458
00:17:55,204 --> 00:17:56,937
I know what you're thinking...

459
00:17:56,939 --> 00:17:58,839
you're better than me, right?

460
00:17:58,841 --> 00:18:03,210
Yeah, 'cause you on the outside,
'cause you got options.

461
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:05,180
You just roll your eyes at me?

462
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:09,049
What you got, a death wish?

463
00:18:09,051 --> 00:18:11,028
You think these guards gonna save you?

464
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,252
I'm in here 40 years.

465
00:18:12,254 --> 00:18:14,588
You think I'm scared of
a few weeks in the hole,

466
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,224
five more on my sentence?

467
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,693
Step back, Caine.

468
00:18:19,695 --> 00:18:20,829
Now.

469
00:18:31,307 --> 00:18:34,875
Caine's passionate.

470
00:18:34,877 --> 00:18:37,277
He's got what
psychological professionals

471
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,614
would describe as "anger issues".

472
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:43,951
Say something wrong to him,
he'll turn your bones to dust.

473
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:46,787
But deep down, the real reason
that he's here with you

474
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:48,722
is because he wishes that someone

475
00:18:48,724 --> 00:18:51,848
had diverted him from this place.

476
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,860
Not me.

477
00:18:52,862 --> 00:18:55,829
I'm here because
it got me out of my cell.

478
00:18:55,831 --> 00:18:59,733
Plus, it gives me a
glimpse of future prey.

479
00:18:59,735 --> 00:19:01,879
I want you guys to end up here.

480
00:19:01,881 --> 00:19:05,172
I'm gonna be behind bars until I'm 90...

481
00:19:05,174 --> 00:19:08,141
long as I don't get caught
blinding another inmate.

482
00:19:08,143 --> 00:19:10,110
Which I will never do again, ma'am.

483
00:19:10,112 --> 00:19:11,144
I have learned my lesson.

484
00:19:11,146 --> 00:19:13,680
Don't talk to me, Oscar. Talk to them.

485
00:19:13,682 --> 00:19:14,749
Yes, ma'am.

486
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:18,318
So, you're the future
inmates of America.

487
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,988
Trust me, stay on this path, do that,

488
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,057
so you can end up in here with me.

489
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:28,195
How many criminals get away
with their crimes, Officer Nolan?

490
00:19:28,197 --> 00:19:29,930
- Not many.
- Why is that?

491
00:19:29,932 --> 00:19:30,998
Because they're dumb.

492
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,299
Oh, I'm not dumb.

493
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:34,434
No, but you lack impulse control.

494
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:36,336
Yes!

495
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:38,039
I do!

496
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:45,913
What's your name?

497
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:46,947
Hector.

498
00:19:46,949 --> 00:19:49,116
Do you think that you're
a tough guy, Hector?

499
00:19:49,118 --> 00:19:51,952
- I know I am.
- You're not.

500
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:54,688
Uh, maybe you are.
Doesn't really matter.

501
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,024
There's always gonna be
somebody tougher than you,

502
00:19:57,026 --> 00:20:00,027
somebody willing to
do what you won't do.

503
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:01,451
Do you know that tough guys

504
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:04,031
get shanked to death in here every day?

505
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,466
Not me, though.

506
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:08,835
'Cause I'm not a tough guy.

507
00:20:08,837 --> 00:20:11,705
I'm a cockroach.

508
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:14,309
I'll do whatever it takes
to come out on top.

509
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:19,746
This is not how to reach Hector.

510
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:22,182
It is not your job
to tell her how to do hers.

511
00:20:22,184 --> 00:20:24,217
It's okay, Detective.
I'm willing to listen.

512
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:26,887
Hector's brother, Thomas,
is incarcerated here.

513
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:30,757
So you think that a family
reunion is more effective?

514
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:32,826
I read both their files.

515
00:20:32,828 --> 00:20:35,395
Hector was a model citizen
before his brother got arrested.

516
00:20:35,397 --> 00:20:37,030
He idolized him.

517
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:39,354
But he hasn't visited in almost a year

518
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:40,934
because Thomas refuses to see him.

519
00:20:40,936 --> 00:20:42,235
Maybe it's time for Hector

520
00:20:42,237 --> 00:20:44,071
to see how far his brother has fallen.

521
00:20:49,244 --> 00:20:50,844
Hey, you got a minute?

522
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:52,012
Oh, yeah, of course.

523
00:20:52,014 --> 00:20:53,703
I just spoke to Paul's doctors.

524
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:55,215
Tox labs came back clean.

525
00:20:55,217 --> 00:20:58,752
They ran every commonly
available poison... nothing.

526
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:01,421
Wait, so how is his mom making him sick?

527
00:21:01,423 --> 00:21:04,858
I don't know, but this
whole thing is not adding up.

528
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,360
Hmm.

529
00:21:06,362 --> 00:21:08,095
I'm gonna reach out to a co-worker

530
00:21:08,097 --> 00:21:09,763
who had a case on the same block.

531
00:21:09,765 --> 00:21:11,064
Maybe she heard something.

532
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:13,200
- That's great. Keep me posted?
- Will do.

533
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:16,970
Down. Up.

534
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:19,206
Down. Up.

535
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,074
Don't... Don't you dare stop.

536
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:22,076
Give it a rest, Caine.

537
00:21:23,545 --> 00:21:25,078
Boy's with me.

538
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,413
Get up.

539
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:27,706
On your feet, on your feet!

540
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:28,775
Let's go!

541
00:21:29,762 --> 00:21:30,784
Thomas?

542
00:21:30,786 --> 00:21:32,886
You on the phone every week,

543
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:35,155
telling me how great you're doing,

544
00:21:35,157 --> 00:21:36,356
and this is how I see you?

545
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:40,560
Hector's been getting into
a lot of trouble lately.

546
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:43,897
Spent the last few months
in juvie for theft and drugs.

547
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:46,433
He wants to follow in his
big brother's footsteps.

548
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,135
Why the hell you want to do that?

549
00:21:48,137 --> 00:21:49,469
Because he doesn't know any better.

550
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:51,238
He thinks you're a role model.

551
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,305
Hey, don't talk to him like that.

552
00:21:52,307 --> 00:21:54,241
No, lady cop's right.

553
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:55,475
I'm no one to be proud of.

554
00:21:55,477 --> 00:21:56,543
How can you say that?

555
00:21:56,545 --> 00:21:58,478
You run things in here.
People respect you.

556
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,981
No, they're afraid of me.

557
00:22:00,983 --> 00:22:02,916
That ain't the same thing.

558
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,454
When you're in here, you can't
afford to be a human being.

559
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:11,358
And once you lose that,
you can never get it back.

560
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:14,961
Don't be me.

561
00:22:17,176 --> 00:22:18,198
What's that?

562
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,845
Just a little bit of trouble.

563
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:21,835
It's a daily occurrence around here,

564
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:23,303
but I do need to go see to it.

565
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:26,407
Sharp, put the three of
them on a short leash.

566
00:22:28,343 --> 00:22:29,543
Warden's lying.

567
00:22:29,545 --> 00:22:33,346
Two short bursts mean
there's a riot going on.

568
00:22:33,348 --> 00:22:36,250
About to get crazy up in here.

569
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:41,285
Sir, do you have a second?

570
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:43,321
Sure. What's up?

571
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:45,823
Hypothetically,

572
00:22:45,825 --> 00:22:47,592
what's involved in a lateral move?

573
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:49,227
Well, I hate to lose you,

574
00:22:49,229 --> 00:22:51,229
but the truth is,
it'd be pretty seamless.

575
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:52,463
What about NYPD?

576
00:22:52,465 --> 00:22:54,899
That's a whole other beast.

577
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:57,560
You would have to go
to the NYPD Academy,

578
00:22:57,562 --> 00:22:58,918
complete the FTO program

579
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,805
before you'd even be
allowed back on the streets.

580
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:02,907
You would basically be
starting from square one.

581
00:23:04,344 --> 00:23:06,477
In fact

582
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:08,913
you would be the John Nolan of the NYPD.

583
00:23:08,915 --> 00:23:10,782
No, you see that's not funny.

584
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:14,685
That's hilarious.

585
00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:17,522
It'd be a big sacrifice.

586
00:23:17,524 --> 00:23:19,490
But if Rachel's the
one, it'd be worth it.

587
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:21,393
Who said this was about Rachel?

588
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:26,364
Just be sure.

589
00:23:26,366 --> 00:23:28,666
Moving in together is tough enough.

590
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:32,107
Plus new jobs, new city, no
social network to lean on...

591
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:33,938
You don't want to end
up resenting each other.

592
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,973
Thanks.

593
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:37,608
Anytime, "Boot".

594
00:23:38,945 --> 00:23:40,344
Why'd he call you "Boot"?

595
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:41,914
Nothing. Inside joke.

596
00:23:43,195 --> 00:23:44,622
Hey. What's up?

597
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:46,504
My co-worker heard that a few other kids

598
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:48,206
in the neighborhood got sick recently.

599
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,723
Turns out, the city started maintenance

600
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:51,542
on the main water line four months ago,

601
00:23:51,544 --> 00:23:53,044
so they switched to well water.

602
00:23:53,046 --> 00:23:54,512
And Paul got sick three months ago.

603
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:56,514
Five years ago, Seaver
Chemical was accused

604
00:23:56,516 --> 00:23:58,516
of dumping heavy metals
from their refinery.

605
00:23:58,518 --> 00:24:01,519
They paid a small fine and
got a high-priced consultant

606
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:04,355
to certify that the environmental
impact was negligible.

607
00:24:04,357 --> 00:24:05,893
Well, clearly, that
might not be the case.

608
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:08,559
Yes, but that does not help Iris.

609
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:11,195
I got her son taken away from her,

610
00:24:11,197 --> 00:24:13,031
and reversing that is not gonna be easy.

611
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:14,840
Can't you just tell the
judge you made a mistake?

612
00:24:14,842 --> 00:24:18,336
Not without definitive proof.

613
00:24:18,338 --> 00:24:22,073
Iris could lose her son

614
00:24:22,075 --> 00:24:25,510
all because I pulled
the trigger too quickly.

615
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:26,711
It's okay.

616
00:24:29,516 --> 00:24:31,849
Better hope that the
Warden squashes this riot.

617
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:35,553
Cops and kids are about the best
hostages inmates could dream of.

618
00:24:35,555 --> 00:24:36,621
Oscar, shut up.

619
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:38,823
Shouldn't you take these
guys back to their cells?

620
00:24:38,825 --> 00:24:40,591
I mean, Harper and I can guard the kids.

621
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:42,226
I don't make a move without orders.

622
00:24:45,498 --> 00:24:47,832
I'm guessing three bursts
is worse than two?

623
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,267
It's just a call to prayer.

624
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:52,570
As in... pray they kill you quick.

625
00:24:52,572 --> 00:24:55,840
Wait. So, uh, you called them
"pre-assault indicators", right?

626
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:57,408
- Right.
- I got a question.

627
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,177
Did you use your dating algorithm

628
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:00,878
as a base for the LAPD one?

629
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,780
'Course not.

630
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:04,682
That's a yes.

631
00:25:04,684 --> 00:25:06,417
Hold on just a second. Sally.

632
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:08,419
- Elvis, Elvis, where are you?
- Wh...

633
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:10,329
- He's got a gun.
- Wait, wait, wait. C-Calm down, calm down.

634
00:25:10,331 --> 00:25:11,556
- What's going on?
- One of our clients, I think.

635
00:25:11,558 --> 00:25:13,057
- Uh, who?
- What's happening?

636
00:25:13,059 --> 00:25:14,625
- He's got a gun. He said it's our fault.
- Uh, uh, one of our clients

637
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:16,627
blames us for his breakup, and
he just showed up with a gun.

638
00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:17,972
Oh, my God. Help!

639
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,797
Uh, wait, Sally, are you still there?

640
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:21,099
- Sally?
- 7-Adam-07.

641
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:28,606
7-Adam-07.

642
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:30,374
We're on scene and have
a possible active shooter

643
00:25:30,376 --> 00:25:32,610
at 2100 Knoll Road. Shots fired.

644
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:34,098
Wait here behind our car.

645
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,876
When officers arrive, show
them what door we went in

646
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:37,180
and do exactly as they tell you.

647
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:39,743
7-Adam-07. We're making entry
now through the north door.

648
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:42,420
Repeat, two officers
making entry, north door.

649
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:44,155
All responding units, Code 3.

650
00:25:44,157 --> 00:25:45,723
- Copy. 7-Adam-07 making entry on an active shooter.
- You're not waiting for backup?

651
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:47,258
Not on an active shooter. We go in.

652
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,227
But you don't. No matter
what you see or hear,

653
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:50,762
you stay outside, stay behind cover!

654
00:25:50,764 --> 00:25:52,579
If you follow us in, the
coroner can carry you out.

655
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:53,648
Understand?

656
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,877
- Help us! He's got a gun!
- Go! Go!

657
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:07,478
How many shooters? How many shooters?

658
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,780
How many shooters? Go!

659
00:26:08,782 --> 00:26:10,782
- Go!
- Go, go!

660
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:12,350
Go! Get out!

661
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:26,931
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

662
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:28,666
- Get out! Go, go!
- Go!

663
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:36,307
Go! Go! Go!

664
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:37,476
Go, go, go!

665
00:26:39,212 --> 00:26:40,930
7-Adam-07, units are landing.

666
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,480
Can you give us an update?

667
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:48,486
7-Adam-07, security check.

668
00:26:48,488 --> 00:26:51,522
7-Adam-100, be advised
7-Adam-07 not responding.

669
00:26:51,524 --> 00:26:53,391
We have more...

670
00:27:02,702 --> 00:27:04,303
Shh.

671
00:27:12,912 --> 00:27:14,313
Oh!

672
00:27:18,418 --> 00:27:19,650
Get on your stomach!

673
00:27:19,652 --> 00:27:21,819
Control, 7-Adam-07. Shooter in custody.

674
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:23,254
Code 4 in the Bullpen.

675
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:25,357
Copy, shooter in custody. Code 4.

676
00:27:27,498 --> 00:27:29,568
Hey. How bad is it out there?

677
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,093
Several casualties.
Mostly inmates, one guard.

678
00:27:33,095 --> 00:27:35,919
60% of the prison is
under inmate control,

679
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,120
which means you've got to go.

680
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:39,256
Lock them in cells in B Wing

681
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:41,124
and then fold in with the CERT team.

682
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,960
C.O. Sharp is going to
escort you and the kids

683
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,128
to the nearest exit.

684
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,830
At this moment, the coast is clear.

685
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,298
Be safe.

686
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,968
Officers, take care of my brother.

687
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,004
I won't let anything happen to him.

688
00:27:54,006 --> 00:27:56,273
You have my word.

689
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,008
You listen to this man.

690
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,666
Do what he says.

691
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:01,678
And stay the hell away from here.

692
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,681
You're better than me. Act like it.

693
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,987
Okay, let's go.

694
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,028
See you later, John.

695
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,796
Alright. Time to move.

696
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,798
Not yet. We need weapons.

697
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,768
In case the way is not clear.

698
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,171
Come on, boys.

699
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:29,739
You never wanted to smash
up a classroom before?

700
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:30,908
Now's your chance.

701
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,210
Hey. Are you scared?

702
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,046
You want the truth?

703
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,470
No.

704
00:28:37,472 --> 00:28:39,182
I'm not scared at all.

705
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,651
- Right.
- Let's go.

706
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,776
Is there a way out of here that
doesn't go through a cell block?

707
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:44,854
No.

708
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:45,989
I knew he was gonna say that.

709
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:47,724
Let's go, boys. Thank you.

710
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,693
Come on.

711
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,835
Alright, well, we're gonna
get a paramedic to look at you.

712
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:01,204
Six victims. So far, no fatalities.

713
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:03,073
Oh, th... thank God.

714
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,241
I never saw this coming.

715
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,043
Why did I not see this coming?

716
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,913
Because you trusted the
data, but people lie.

717
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,171
No guy is gonna reveal a
history of domestic violence

718
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:13,261
in his dating profile.

719
00:29:13,263 --> 00:29:16,219
But I thought that I-I
had factored in firewalls

720
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,687
for erroneous data.

721
00:29:17,689 --> 00:29:19,089
Not enough.

722
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:57,260
He's dead.

723
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:58,795
Just keep walking.

724
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,397
Keep moving, boys. Come on.

725
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,232
Let's go.

726
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,733
Keep walking. Come on, boys.

727
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:06,670
Hector. Hey, Hector.

728
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:07,771
No!

729
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:08,805
Just...

730
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:17,013
Hey, J.J., I got those
Scared Straight kids.

731
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:19,050
Hell yeah. On our way.

732
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,008
You don't have to do this, you guys.

733
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,153
Yeah, we do.

734
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,988
Then we're done talking.

735
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,423
Boys, get behind us.

736
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,885
Nolan! We got to go!

737
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:57,454
- Move! Move!
- Go! Go!

738
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,801
Get up, get up, get up!

739
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:14,972
- It's locked.
- Keys.

740
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:18,208
Come on, come on, come on.

741
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,648
Hey. Have you heard from Rachel?

742
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,726
No. Why?

743
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,032
She blames herself
for yanking Iris's son

744
00:31:39,034 --> 00:31:40,230
before the tests were run.

745
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:41,898
Look, I've been calling, texting.

746
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,966
She's not getting back to me.

747
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,734
What do you think, she's
gonna do something stupid?

748
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,271
You know her better than
I do. What do you think?

749
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:59,349
Listen up. We got ourselves a VIP.

750
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:01,184
Get your hands off me!

751
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,952
- That's the Warden.
- You try and take the prison back,

752
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,020
we'll rip her to pieces.

753
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:06,189
A list of demands will be forthwith.

754
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,857
Until then, have a great day.

755
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,425
Any chance that CERT team is nearby?

756
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,461
No, they're clear on the
other side of the prison.

757
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:13,229
There's no way they'll
get to her in time.

758
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,933
But we can.

759
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,868
Why? You don't owe her nothing.

760
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,670
'Cause it's the right thing to do.
You remember that.

761
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,322
You practiced it back
at the gas station.

762
00:32:22,324 --> 00:32:24,407
Why does everything have to be
a teachable moment with you?

763
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,976
Because he knows it's annoying.

764
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,479
8977.

765
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:30,980
You ready?

766
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:32,082
Yeah.

767
00:32:38,418 --> 00:32:40,720
Why're we going this way?

768
00:32:40,722 --> 00:32:42,011
The Warden's in the opposite direction.

769
00:32:42,013 --> 00:32:43,189
I know, but we need a little help.

770
00:32:43,191 --> 00:32:44,258
From who?

771
00:32:47,162 --> 00:32:48,361
Hey, guys.

772
00:32:48,363 --> 00:32:50,363
Why aren't you out there running
wild, like the rest of them?

773
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:53,033
I was, then I got tired.

774
00:32:53,035 --> 00:32:55,368
All I really wanted to do

775
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:58,255
was beat the hell out of
this one guy, Kevin Medved.

776
00:32:58,257 --> 00:32:59,279
And did you?

777
00:32:59,281 --> 00:33:01,341
No, somebody beat me to it.

778
00:33:01,343 --> 00:33:03,143
I know, right? Just my luck.

779
00:33:03,145 --> 00:33:08,214
But I did get to laugh in
his face, which was nice.

780
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:12,052
I'm surprised to see
you two in one piece.

781
00:33:12,054 --> 00:33:13,420
Where's the kids?

782
00:33:13,422 --> 00:33:15,388
Did you trade them for safe passage?

783
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:16,479
No, we got them out.

784
00:33:16,481 --> 00:33:19,225
And then you came back.

785
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:20,694
For the Warden.

786
00:33:20,696 --> 00:33:22,529
Mm. Why you coming to me?

787
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:23,830
'Cause you're gonna help us get her out.

788
00:33:23,832 --> 00:33:25,398
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

789
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,767
If I've learned anything about
you these last few months,

790
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:29,703
it's that you are the
ultimate opportunist.

791
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:31,061
You find yourself in a situation

792
00:33:31,063 --> 00:33:33,206
where there's a chance to
escape, you try to escape.

793
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,541
But there's no escaping today,

794
00:33:34,543 --> 00:33:36,409
which is why you're
still here in your cell.

795
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:39,245
So I'm here to offer
you the next best thing.

796
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:41,748
To escape? There is no such thing.

797
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,850
Sure there is. Privileges.

798
00:33:43,852 --> 00:33:46,586
You help us rescue the Warden,
you can ask for anything.

799
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:48,088
You help us, we help you.

800
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,557
Are you in, or are you out?

801
00:33:54,363 --> 00:33:55,595
Have a seat on the bench.

802
00:33:55,597 --> 00:33:56,696
Whoa. What's going on?

803
00:33:56,698 --> 00:33:58,765
She assaulted some corporate
guy outside his office.

804
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:01,357
I did not. I threw water in his face.

805
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:02,381
Contaminated water?

806
00:34:02,383 --> 00:34:03,470
No.

807
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:05,438
But he thought it was.

808
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,341
Can I talk to you for a second?

809
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:11,711
Let me take her off
your hands, cite her out.

810
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:13,403
She's all yours.

811
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:14,405
Thanks.

812
00:34:16,318 --> 00:34:18,318
What the hell were you thinking?

813
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,321
He didn't even
care... that kids are sick.

814
00:34:21,323 --> 00:34:23,323
And he's got kids of his own.

815
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:25,291
And you were surprised by that?

816
00:34:26,661 --> 00:34:28,628
What do I do now?

817
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,630
How do I make everything right?

818
00:34:30,632 --> 00:34:32,266
I don't know that you can.

819
00:34:34,236 --> 00:34:37,237
But I've... I've called in some favors,

820
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:40,473
and I got the Deputy
Chief to call the judge.

821
00:34:40,475 --> 00:34:42,342
And based on my personal assurances,

822
00:34:42,344 --> 00:34:46,080
he's reversing the order
removing Paul from his home.

823
00:34:49,317 --> 00:34:52,119
You... You did that for me?

824
00:34:54,256 --> 00:34:56,756
Even though I'm leaving?

825
00:34:57,859 --> 00:34:59,393
Duh.

826
00:35:00,662 --> 00:35:01,795
Tim, I...

827
00:35:01,797 --> 00:35:04,931
I know, I know.

828
00:35:04,933 --> 00:35:06,633
Look, do... do you want to cry about it,

829
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:10,870
or do you want to go get Iris
and... and bring her to her son?

830
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:12,839
Both.

831
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:14,542
Yeah, I can work with that.

832
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,361
Hey. Don't screw us.

833
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:36,729
Relax.

834
00:35:44,406 --> 00:35:46,372
Hey, guys.

835
00:35:46,374 --> 00:35:48,541
Oscar, get your crazy ass out of here

836
00:35:48,543 --> 00:35:49,709
before I slice you open.

837
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:52,679
Okay. I guess I'll, uh, trade
these two cops I caught

838
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:53,948
to the Mexicans.

839
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,417
You got those cops?

840
00:35:57,419 --> 00:35:58,985
Where?

841
00:35:58,987 --> 00:36:00,887
Just outside here. I tied 'em up.

842
00:36:24,246 --> 00:36:26,346
- Ready?
- Yeah.

843
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:30,950
Hi. We'll get you out of here now.

844
00:36:30,952 --> 00:36:32,886
Thank goodness.

845
00:36:32,888 --> 00:36:34,510
What the hell is he doing here with you?

846
00:36:34,512 --> 00:36:35,755
Saving you.

847
00:36:35,757 --> 00:36:37,590
And my services don't come cheap.

848
00:36:37,592 --> 00:36:40,760
We're gonna start the bidding
with a plasma television screen,

849
00:36:40,762 --> 00:36:43,029
followed by biweekly conjugal visits.

850
00:36:43,031 --> 00:36:44,898
We told him you'd make a deal.

851
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,965
I will not.

852
00:36:45,967 --> 00:36:47,334
Then I'll see you later.

853
00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:50,004
Fine.

854
00:36:51,873 --> 00:36:53,407
- Fine.
- Let's go.

855
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,388
Get behind me.

856
00:37:12,323 --> 00:37:15,080
Thank the good Lord.
I just found these two

857
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:18,139
trying to steal the
Warden from you guys.

858
00:37:18,141 --> 00:37:19,631
Where's Hector?

859
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,689
We got him out.

860
00:37:21,691 --> 00:37:22,813
For real?

861
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:23,937
For real.

862
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:25,195
Back off, Thomas.

863
00:37:25,197 --> 00:37:27,812
This ain't got nothing to do with you.

864
00:37:27,814 --> 00:37:29,147
They walk.

865
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:30,782
Like hell they do.

866
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:32,083
They walk.

867
00:37:51,695 --> 00:37:52,828
Thank you.

868
00:37:57,368 --> 00:38:01,604
So I'm gonna make sure these
guys find their way out.

869
00:38:06,944 --> 00:38:09,805
Sit here. I'll change, and
then I'll take you to juvie

870
00:38:09,807 --> 00:38:11,813
to process out with
the rest of the boys.

871
00:38:11,815 --> 00:38:13,549
Cool. Thanks.

872
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:17,486
Paperwork can wait till tomorrow.

873
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:18,720
I hear that.

874
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:20,522
- See you in a minute.
- See you.

875
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:22,724
Hey, trouble kind of
finds you, doesn't it?

876
00:38:22,726 --> 00:38:25,293
They told us to scare the kids.

877
00:38:25,295 --> 00:38:26,695
We scared those kids.

878
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:28,230
How are things going with Grace?

879
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:29,664
Ah, I'm not sure.

880
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:31,900
She's having dinner
with her ex as we speak.

881
00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:33,301
That a problem?

882
00:38:33,303 --> 00:38:34,836
I don't know. I guess that's up to her.

883
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:35,937
She knows how I feel.

884
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,506
And how do you feel?

885
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:41,843
I'm a little in love with her.

886
00:38:41,845 --> 00:38:42,878
You tell her that?

887
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,513
Well, I...

888
00:38:44,515 --> 00:38:47,849
implied it, you know, with my actions.

889
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:49,518
- It's not the same, is it?
- Nope.

890
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,741
Okay, so, you guys want
to hear something funny?

891
00:38:50,743 --> 00:38:52,654
- It's not that funny.
- No, it definitely is.

892
00:38:52,656 --> 00:38:54,256
- Just not to you.
- I'm losing interest.

893
00:38:54,258 --> 00:38:56,391
Okay, so, Elvis's algorithm
flagged Lopez

894
00:38:56,393 --> 00:38:58,727
- as being most likely to get sued, right?
- Okay?

895
00:38:58,729 --> 00:39:00,829
- He got the wrong Lopez.
- What?

896
00:39:00,831 --> 00:39:02,564
He mixed up two lines
on his spreadsheet,

897
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:03,999
confused me with another A. Lopez.

898
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:05,567
Albert Lopez from Property Crimes?

899
00:39:05,569 --> 00:39:06,902
No, Angelo Lopez in Vice.

900
00:39:06,904 --> 00:39:08,403
Oh, in Vice.

901
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:10,005
Funny, right?

902
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:21,416
Hey. Harper will be
out in just a minute.

903
00:39:21,418 --> 00:39:23,351
Can I get you some food
for the road or something?

904
00:39:23,353 --> 00:39:24,553
No, I'm... I'm good.

905
00:39:24,555 --> 00:39:28,056
Tell me, have I earned the right
to give you a little advice?

906
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:30,025
Another teachable moment? Really?

907
00:39:30,027 --> 00:39:31,927
Only if you'd care to hear it.

908
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:34,563
Fair enough. Hit me.

909
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:35,832
Alright.

910
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:40,769
It's okay to put yourself
second once in a while.

911
00:39:40,771 --> 00:39:42,906
Those men today at the prison,

912
00:39:42,908 --> 00:39:45,307
they all had one thing in common...

913
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:46,508
they were selfish.

914
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:50,745
They put their own petty,
reckless needs above all else.

915
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:54,616
When my dad abandoned us, I acted out.

916
00:39:54,618 --> 00:39:57,052
I got into fights. I...

917
00:39:57,054 --> 00:39:59,554
I made bad choices.

918
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:02,624
And I drove my mom crazy with worry,

919
00:40:02,626 --> 00:40:05,494
and I didn't like how that felt.

920
00:40:05,496 --> 00:40:09,064
She needed me to be better.

921
00:40:09,066 --> 00:40:10,765
So that's what I did.

922
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:12,400
You make it sound so easy.

923
00:40:12,402 --> 00:40:16,805
It's really not easy,
but it was worth it.

924
00:40:18,308 --> 00:40:19,341
You ready?

925
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:20,742
Uh, yeah.

926
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:26,815
Thanks.

927
00:40:26,817 --> 00:40:27,884
Anytime.

928
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:36,024
- Hi.
- Hey.

929
00:40:36,026 --> 00:40:38,493
I hope that it's okay
that I just came by.

930
00:40:38,495 --> 00:40:40,028
Yeah, of course, of course.

931
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,664
You're... You finished
your dinner with, uh...

932
00:40:42,666 --> 00:40:43,999
- Simon.
- Simon.

933
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:46,001
Yeah.

934
00:40:46,003 --> 00:40:49,337
- Been an interesting day.
- It certainly has.

935
00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:51,673
Yeah.

936
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:54,042
- I need to tell you something.
- I need to tell you something.

937
00:40:54,044 --> 00:40:55,810
I need to go first.

938
00:40:55,812 --> 00:40:57,345
Okay.

939
00:40:59,783 --> 00:41:03,518
The reason that Oliver has
been having trouble at school

940
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,720
is because of the divorce.

941
00:41:05,722 --> 00:41:07,455
The separation.

942
00:41:07,457 --> 00:41:08,823
Right.

943
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:10,593
Simon...

944
00:41:14,531 --> 00:41:16,599
He wants to give it another try.

945
00:41:18,702 --> 00:41:21,036
For Oliver.

946
00:41:25,842 --> 00:41:27,409
What do you want?

947
00:41:27,411 --> 00:41:29,511
I don't know.

948
00:41:29,513 --> 00:41:33,582
You and I have such a great thing.

949
00:41:37,588 --> 00:41:40,183
But if getting back together with Simon

950
00:41:40,185 --> 00:41:43,725
is the best thing for Oliver,

951
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:45,995
how can I dismiss that?

952
00:41:48,932 --> 00:41:51,100
I just need to take some time.

953
00:41:54,605 --> 00:41:56,571
I'm so sorry.
