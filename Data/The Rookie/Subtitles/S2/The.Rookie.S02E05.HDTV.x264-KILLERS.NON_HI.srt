Dad.

Hey, what are you doing here?

7
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:23,191
Abigail had a buttload of flyer miles,

8
00:00:23,228 --> 00:00:24,728
so we, uh, flew out to surprise you.

9
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:25,861
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:28,199
Abigail,
it's so nice to finally meet you.

11
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:29,748
It's great to meet you, too.

12
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:32,746
The videos didn't do it justice.

00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,304
This place is a wreck.

14
00:00:34,341 --> 00:00:35,808
I think it's awesome.

15
00:00:35,842 --> 00:00:37,558
It's like a faded beauty queen

16
00:00:37,633 --> 00:00:39,038
that you're bringing back to life.

17
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:41,027
Oh, wow. You are quickly
becoming my favorite.

18
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:42,301
Mine, too.

00:00:42,464 --> 00:00:44,605
Uh, we have some good news.

20
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:46,339
Exciting. Lay it on me.

21
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:47,630
I'm pregnant.

22
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,691
Kidding. I'm... I'm kidding.

23
00:00:50,952 --> 00:00:52,660
We're engaged.

24
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,137
Sorry about the pregnant thing.

25
00:00:56,174 --> 00:00:57,808
I-I thought it would soften the blow.

26
00:00:57,896 --> 00:01:00,115
Abigail, uh, that is, um, is beautiful.

27
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:01,352
That's a beautiful ri...

28
00:01:01,386 --> 00:01:03,449
I hope you didn't, uh,
spend your tuition money.

29
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:05,520
I used the money that I
was saving to go to Europe,

30
00:01:05,557 --> 00:01:07,335
because Abigail's the journey

31
00:01:07,372 --> 00:01:09,175
I want to spend the rest of my life on.

32
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:11,113
- Aww.
- Aww.

33
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:12,668
That's so... That is...

34
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,905
That's so...

35
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,621
Does your mom know?

36
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:18,513
She thought it would be best
if I told you in person.

37
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,832
Uh, yeah. She also recommended

38
00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:21,303
that we quickly follow the news

39
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,260
- with some electrolytes.
- That is...

40
00:01:23,296 --> 00:01:25,805
hilarious and entirely unnecessary.

41
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:27,063
Have you set a date?

42
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,302
Not yet, but we're, uh,
we're talking about June.

43
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,066
Isn't it exciting?

44
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:34,736
It's so exciting.

45
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:36,674
Crap!

46
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:52,143
I feel like Goldilocks,

47
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,214
except instead of "too hot"
or "too cold,"

48
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:58,118
every guy I date is either,
you know, "too frat-bro,"

49
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:00,053
or "too stick me with the check"

50
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:02,289
because you are never going
to finish that screenplay

51
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:03,664
"working on your abs."

52
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,823
Let's face it,
I am never going to find someone.

53
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,140
Yeah, not if you keep looking

54
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:08,469
in hipster clubs and hot yoga studios.

55
00:02:08,506 --> 00:02:10,695
- Ah.
- What you need is a grown man.

56
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:12,667
I would just settle for
a decent pickup line.

57
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,472
Oh, thank God, okay.

58
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,838
Wow. We gotta go.

59
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:17,628
Thank you.

60
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:19,794
Mom.

61
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:21,011
What are you doing here?

62
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:24,177
Your father and I are getting divorced.

63
00:02:25,497 --> 00:02:27,387
Hi, Mrs. Chen. I'm so sorry.

64
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:29,480
Oh, Jackson, sweetheart, thank you.

65
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:30,934
What happened?

66
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:33,005
I don't want to talk about it.

67
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:34,354
Okay, is this like the time

68
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,786
that you didn't talk to Dad for a week

69
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,991
because he forgot your birthday?

70
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:40,997
I said I don't want to talk about it.

71
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,666
Oh. I'm sure my back will be fine.

72
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,498
I assume you have extra bedding.

73
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,934
Oh. Mom, you're not
sleeping on the couch.

74
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:49,796
I'll get you a hotel.

75
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:51,951
Nonsense. No, I'll take the couch.

76
00:02:51,988 --> 00:02:53,810
Mrs. Chen, you can take my room.

77
00:02:53,922 --> 00:02:55,817
Such a sweet boy.

78
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,600
Would you mind putting this in my room?

79
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:58,756
I have to get ready for work.

80
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:02,206
Is that really what you're wearing?

81
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,158
Nice groupings.

82
00:03:12,847 --> 00:03:14,253
Thanks.

83
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,660
So, I need yesterday's
after-action reports.

84
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,664
I will have them for you
at the end of shift.

85
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:20,100
You mean when today's are due?

86
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:22,862
I know you're used to being
out on the edge, all alone,

87
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:24,867
but paperwork's part of the gig here.

88
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,021
Copy that. I will get caught up quick.

89
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:28,375
Officer Nolan's not the only one

90
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,925
being evaluated, Detective.

91
00:03:29,962 --> 00:03:31,121
I know you got the golden ticket,

92
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:32,417
but you got to do the work.

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,996
Understand?

94
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:35,802
Yes, sir.

95
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:42,427
Henry got engaged.

96
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,590
Yeah, he just turned 20.

97
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,822
I know. It's too young.

98
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,059
Didn't you get married around then?

99
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:47,295
That's not the point.

100
00:03:47,332 --> 00:03:48,833
So, I just talked to my dad.

101
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:52,114
Apparently, he only brought home
a bagel for himself.

102
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:55,011
- He did not bring one for my mom.
- That's why she left?

103
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:56,810
Bagel that broke the camel's back.

104
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:59,087
- Maybe it's for the best.
- Oh, God, no.

105
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:01,698
Separately, they will make
my life twice as miserable.

106
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:03,258
I have to get them back together.

107
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:05,280
- Just...
- Morning.

108
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:08,201
She is definitely warming up to me.

109
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:11,022
So, Officer West,

110
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:12,979
- can you tell us what a "friendly" is?
- Yes, sir.

111
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:15,339
A "friendly" is another term
for a Confidential Informant.

112
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:17,072
Correct. And Confidential Informants

113
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:18,776
can be an incredibly useful tool.

114
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,896
They're definitely tools.

115
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:22,778
Are you saying you don't
use them, Officer Bradford?

116
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:24,857
No, sir. Just saying
that they're lying liars

117
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:26,515
who lie and they need to be dominated,

118
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:28,132
never allowed to think
they're in control.

119
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,006
- Officer Lopez, you agree?
- No, sir.

120
00:04:30,043 --> 00:04:31,491
C.I.s are most useful when they think

121
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:32,732
they're part of the team.

122
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:33,969
You're both wrong.

123
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:35,545
Please, school us, Detective.

124
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:37,258
C.I.s are just people trying to get by.

125
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:39,398
Some are psychopaths who play ball

126
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:41,163
because it's the best available option,

127
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,165
some are people in over their heads

128
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,286
who cling to you desperately
as a way out of trouble.

129
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:48,871
Treating them all the same
is a mistake.

130
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:52,153
Well, it's time to put
these theories to the test.

131
00:04:52,408 --> 00:04:54,943
Nolan, Chen, part of the second
phase of your training

132
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:56,348
is developing your first C.I.

133
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:57,760
See, you've known this day was coming,

134
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,783
so I'm confident that you have
a plan of action in place.

135
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,448
But be forewarned...

136
00:05:02,493 --> 00:05:04,549
you will be evaluated on the arrests,

137
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:06,010
generated by your C.I.,

138
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,088
as well as their long-term viability.

139
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,592
So, choose wisely.

140
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,026
Alright, that's it.

141
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,639
Be safe.

142
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:16,811
Sir, you have to let West participate.

143
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:18,801
- Do I?
- You've read my daily evals.

144
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:20,869
His work is as strong
as it's ever been,

145
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,304
and this is an opportunity to prove

146
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:23,495
that he's ready to move on.

147
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,585
It's a big swing, Officer West.

148
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,119
Screw it up...

149
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,176
it's likely to be the last nail.

150
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:30,646
You sure you want to take that chance?

151
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:32,160
Yes, sir.

152
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:35,250
Alright. You're in.

153
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,833
- Good?
- Thank you, sir.

154
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:40,989
You are the greatest T.O.
in the history of T.O.s.

155
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:43,116
- Here you go.
- You got a choice to make...

156
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:45,445
be conservative or be bold.

157
00:05:45,482 --> 00:05:46,604
Tim's gonna make sure

158
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:48,441
Lucy bags a workhorse
for her first C.I.

159
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:50,315
- Nothing flashy.
- And Harper?

160
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:52,262
My guess is she'll
let Nolan drive it...

161
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:53,902
sink or swim on his own.

162
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,246
You think we should go big.

163
00:05:55,283 --> 00:05:56,560
It's the riskiest move,

164
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:58,831
but the one that will get you
into short sleeves quicker.

165
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,414
But a big fish takes time,

166
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:02,791
and if you fail to recruit him,

167
00:06:02,828 --> 00:06:03,948
you run the real risk of hitting

168
00:06:03,985 --> 00:06:05,030
the week's end without someone.

169
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:07,987
And Grey'll bounce me for sure.

170
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,199
Screw it.

171
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:13,987
- Let's go for it.
- That's the spirit.

172
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:15,436
- You got a candidate?
- Yeah.

173
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,832
A guy the Feds use,

174
00:06:16,869 --> 00:06:18,772
but you should hit an ATM
on the way over.

175
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:20,473
This guy's not cheap.

176
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,424
Hey, Nick. Heading home?

177
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,932
My bed awaits.

178
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:25,440
I just had an armed robbery suspect

179
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:27,159
in the box all night, I'm fried.

180
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:28,703
- How're you?
- I just found out

181
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,251
my son got engaged.

182
00:06:30,285 --> 00:06:32,507
Whoa. I-Isn't he, like, 12?

183
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:33,718
- 20.
- Right.

184
00:06:33,755 --> 00:06:35,265
- You like the girl?
- Abigail.

185
00:06:35,302 --> 00:06:37,130
She seems very sweet.

186
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:39,168
Just met her for the first time
this morning.

187
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:41,077
Also 20.

188
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,490
You run her through the system?

189
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:43,931
A background check?

190
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,883
No, it's against the rules,
and it's just...

191
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,195
- wrong.
- If it were me,

192
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,669
I'd want to know.

193
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:50,826
See you tomorrow, well...

194
00:06:50,863 --> 00:06:52,099
Technically tonight.

195
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:53,412
- Right.
- Here you go.

196
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:54,850
Oh.

197
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:02,231
What are we doing here, Boot?

198
00:07:02,268 --> 00:07:03,872
As you're aware,

199
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,515
pawn shops are required by law

200
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:07,524
to notify law enforcement
if they believe someone

201
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,184
is trying to pawn off stolen property.

202
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,452
I pulled city records.

203
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:12,162
This shop has never called us.

204
00:07:12,197 --> 00:07:13,898
Either the owner is a saint, or...

205
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:15,666
Or he's dealing with
a lot of stolen goods.

206
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,953
Exactly. Making them the perfect
candidate for my first C.I.

207
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,364
Don't get too cocky, Officer Chen.

208
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,072
Recruiting a reliable C.I.
is hard work.

209
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:23,387
Yes, sir.

210
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:25,677
Sorry, my parents are...

211
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:27,532
Uh, never mind.

212
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,209
- Morning.
- Good morning.

213
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,090
- What can I do for you?
- We're doing interviews

214
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:36,723
for the detectives in Robbery-Homicide.

215
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,676
Has anyone tried to pass off
stolen items recently?

216
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:40,004
No, absolutely not.

217
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,842
How do you know they're not
stolen before you buy them?

218
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,804
'Cause I'm a very good judge of people.

219
00:07:44,062 --> 00:07:45,240
What's your impression of me?

220
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:47,478
That you're a very distrustful woman.

221
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:55,406
Detective Harrison, it's Officer Chen.

222
00:07:55,614 --> 00:07:57,675
Yeah, we're gonna need you
to send Code Enforcement

223
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,009
down to High-Life...

224
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,611
- That's not necessary.
- Hold on, Craig.

225
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,649
If you're aboveboard,
there shouldn't be a problem, right?

226
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:06,916
Okay.

227
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,383
There may be a few things

228
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,087
that are from questionable sources.

229
00:08:10,386 --> 00:08:11,668
Nice job.

230
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:13,181
Great, let's see it,

231
00:08:13,218 --> 00:08:15,916
and don't give me any of that
low-end misdemeanor crap.

232
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,266
Woman brought this in yesterday,

233
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,007
and it's not the first designer bag

234
00:08:24,044 --> 00:08:25,111
she's brought me.

235
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:26,499
Mm. Retails for what?

236
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:28,627
- Five grand?
- Six.

237
00:08:29,774 --> 00:08:31,375
What are you looking for?

238
00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:34,111
These high-end bags
have serial numbers sewn in.

239
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:36,146
They're registered
to the original buyer.

240
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,697
Yeah.

241
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,383
Bingo.

242
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,799
Hey, there.

243
00:08:44,836 --> 00:08:46,396
Bianca, right?

244
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:48,478
Do I know you?

245
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:50,625
No, I have this acquaintance
in narcotics.

246
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,062
He, uh... Well, actually,

247
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:53,497
I installed a new
kitchen island for him.

248
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,819
Anyway, I was telling him

249
00:08:54,856 --> 00:08:57,649
I need a low-level drug mule
that I can flip into a C.I.,

250
00:08:57,686 --> 00:08:59,390
and he mentioned you.

251
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:03,226
Bianca!

252
00:09:03,508 --> 00:09:05,309
Why are you running?
We know where you live.

253
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:07,141
- She got drugs in her bag.
- Really?

254
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:09,010
- Uh-huh.
- Bianca, is that right?

255
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,318
Easy.

256
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:15,982
Okay. Easy. I got you.

257
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:17,354
Come on. Come on.

258
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,786
Come on.

259
00:09:18,864 --> 00:09:20,325
Relax, okay?

260
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:27,929
- Heroin?
- Yep.

261
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:29,624
Enough to put Bianca in prison

262
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:31,068
for the rest of
her child-bearing years.

263
00:09:31,105 --> 00:09:32,803
Do you want to go to prison, Bianca?

264
00:09:32,896 --> 00:09:34,768
No.

265
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:36,821
Then you're gonna
have to flip on your boss,

266
00:09:36,887 --> 00:09:38,653
and depending on how that goes,

267
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:40,076
you're gonna become an informant...

268
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:41,523
my informant...

269
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,348
pointing us to more drug dealers
and suppliers.

270
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,518
I can't do that. They'll kill me.

271
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:49,243
And we'll protect you.

272
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:51,232
He can't promise you that.

273
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,046
You need to be clear with a C.I.

274
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,458
You'll do your best
to treat them right,

275
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:56,126
look out for them, but you're not God,

276
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,026
and you're not with them 24/7.

277
00:09:58,229 --> 00:09:59,696
Understood.

278
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,492
And thank you.

279
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,500
So, those are your choices, Bianca.

280
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:05,474
You can go to jail or you can help us.

281
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:06,947
What's it gonna be?

282
00:10:14,841 --> 00:10:16,346
You're gonna get me killed.

283
00:10:16,513 --> 00:10:17,882
Hey, if anything happens,

284
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,545
we'll be just across the courtyard.

285
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:21,989
Your boss usually punctual?

286
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,154
For a drug dealer.

287
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,756
Look, don't be a hero.

288
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:27,054
Just give him the bag,

289
00:10:27,091 --> 00:10:28,421
you take your fee, you walk away,

290
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,160
just like you've done
hundreds of times.

291
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:31,515
All done.

292
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:33,196
Talk in a normal voice.

293
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:37,167
Tell the man at the funeral home

294
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:39,548
that I want to be turned into a tree.

295
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:42,806
Make sure they don't put me in a box.

296
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:44,483
I get claustrophobic.

297
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,213
Bianca, I promise...

298
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:52,237
...if anything goes wrong,
we will be there.

299
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:57,089
Can I go to the bathroom
with this stuff?

300
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,904
Sure.

301
00:11:03,285 --> 00:11:05,190
And don't listen.

302
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:16,702
Hey, girl.

303
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:20,444
I thought...

304
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:21,838
Yeah, don't do that.

305
00:11:23,412 --> 00:11:24,913
He'll be here in a minute.

306
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,284
Let's get set.

307
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:30,122
Damn it.

308
00:11:30,182 --> 00:11:32,756
So, I was thinking
we could start small,

309
00:11:33,066 --> 00:11:34,200
see what type of intel you have.

310
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:36,219
Hold your roll, Officer.

311
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:37,594
The only reason I'm talking to you

312
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,296
is 'cause you paid my greens' fee.

313
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:41,987
Truth is, I work exclusively
with the Feds.

314
00:11:42,024 --> 00:11:44,158
They pay way better than the LAPD.

315
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:45,639
100 grand last year,

316
00:11:45,676 --> 00:11:47,741
for intel on nine high-profile felonies.

317
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:49,473
Now, you gonna match that?

318
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,954
While the LAPD can't beat
that kind of number,

319
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:53,649
your FBI handler isn't gonna give you

320
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:55,725
the kind of personal attention
that I will.

321
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:58,608
He offering massages?

322
00:11:58,737 --> 00:12:01,071
There's got to be something or someone

323
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:03,100
that's bothering you.

324
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:06,676
My ex-wife is screwing
this Pakistani guy.

325
00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:09,259
Owns a used car dealership
on Van Nuys...

326
00:12:09,383 --> 00:12:11,168
definitely moving stolen cars.

327
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:12,469
And why do you care?

328
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:14,782
My ex torched all my Armani
suits on the way out.

329
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,601
So... you take something

330
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:18,550
she cares about away from her...

331
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:20,521
I'll play ball.

332
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,771
He's here.

333
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,760
He went into the room.

334
00:12:45,075 --> 00:12:46,709
She's going in.

335
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:07,522
What's going on?

336
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:10,165
It's fine.

337
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:11,781
Let it play out.

338
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:34,650
See?

339
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:36,054
All good.

340
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,152
Arms up.

341
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:46,272
- Hey, I don't get to keep that?
- Sorry.

342
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:48,166
Alright, well, let's go get this guy.

343
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,266
Okay, just sit here, relax.

344
00:13:52,936 --> 00:13:55,335
The hard part's done. Great job.

345
00:14:12,154 --> 00:14:13,258
Freeze.

346
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:15,062
- Police!
- Hands up.

347
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,378
Drop the bag.

348
00:14:17,592 --> 00:14:19,026
Interlace your fingers
behind your head.

349
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,931
Don't move.

350
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:31,200
Decent bust, rookie.

351
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,715
Bianca?

352
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:42,844
Hey.

353
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:46,850
Bianca?

354
00:14:48,843 --> 00:14:51,987
Harper, I need Narcan
in the room right now.

355
00:14:57,585 --> 00:14:58,985
Bianca. Hey.

356
00:14:59,343 --> 00:15:01,044
Stay with me, alright?

357
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:05,703
Where'd she get the drugs?

358
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:07,073
Must have had a leftover from the deal.

359
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:11,278
- Easy, easy, easy. I got you.
- Control, 7-Adam-15...

360
00:15:11,312 --> 00:15:14,057
We need an ambulance
at the Dollar Motel on Olympic.

361
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,219
Female, 25, head injury and overdose.

362
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,575
Mrs.?

363
00:15:30,641 --> 00:15:32,909
Uh, these officers
want to speak with you.

364
00:15:33,463 --> 00:15:34,801
Cool.

365
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:37,418
What's up?

366
00:15:37,455 --> 00:15:39,503
We're here about some stolen property.

367
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,974
Do you recognize this bag?

368
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:45,183
Yeah, I've got one just like it.

369
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,214
We believe this one is yours.
It was at a pawn shop.

370
00:15:47,251 --> 00:15:49,316
We matched the serial number
to your credit card purchase.

371
00:15:49,524 --> 00:15:50,684
Hilda!

372
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:53,170
- Yes, Missus?
- You're fired.

373
00:15:53,293 --> 00:15:54,894
- What?
- Please, don't make a scene.

374
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:56,027
It'll just upset me.

375
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:57,157
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

376
00:15:57,191 --> 00:15:59,125
What's going on? What'd you do?

377
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:00,658
Hilda's been robbing us.

378
00:16:00,695 --> 00:16:02,544
I have not.

379
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:03,900
Who are you?

380
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:05,353
This is my daughter, Olivia.

381
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,359
Stepdaughter.
You were 9 when I was born.

382
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:09,836
Olivia, do you know anything
about a stolen handbag?

383
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,609
The description
the pawn shop owner gave us

384
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:13,306
fits you more than your housekeeper.

385
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,381
Yeah.

386
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,104
Yeah, I took it.

387
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:21,350
But she has so many,
she didn't even notice.

388
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:23,316
You are such a brat.

389
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:24,617
You're such a parasite.

390
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:26,052
Don't talk to your mother that way.

391
00:16:26,087 --> 00:16:28,127
- You are <i>not</i> my mother!
- Okay, calm down.

392
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:29,755
Calm down. Both of you, okay?

393
00:16:29,792 --> 00:16:31,326
I want her arrested.

394
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:32,983
It's the only way she'll learn.

395
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:35,788
Are you sure that's what
her father would want?

396
00:16:35,848 --> 00:16:37,815
Her father wants whatever I tell him.

397
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:55,882
Six stolen cars.

398
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,183
Grey's gonna be impressed,

399
00:16:57,218 --> 00:16:59,219
but we still need to get Hickey
officially signed up.

400
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:00,732
On it.

401
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:02,617
<i>- Yo.</i>
- Mr. Hickey,

402
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:03,734
it's Officer West.

403
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:05,256
Your intel was spot-on.

404
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:06,695
We've impounded six stolen vehicles

405
00:17:06,732 --> 00:17:08,585
and arrested Mr. Fawad Chandio.

406
00:17:08,622 --> 00:17:09,714
<i>That's awesome.</i>

407
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,118
<i>Nicky's gonna cry for a week.</i>

408
00:17:11,265 --> 00:17:12,766
So, it means you're on board?

409
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:14,749
- <i>I'm a man of my word.
- Great.</i>

410
00:17:14,843 --> 00:17:15,945
We'll just need you to come into

411
00:17:15,982 --> 00:17:17,343
the station and
fill out some paperwork.

412
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:18,588
<i>Yeah, you got it.</i>

413
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:21,841
She'll be okay.

414
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:23,043
We're gonna keep her overnight

415
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:24,638
and monitor her for a concussion.

416
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,969
Thanks.

417
00:17:26,006 --> 00:17:27,206
You know, I still don't understand,

418
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:29,042
how she overdosed while in custody.

419
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,013
I left her alone
while we made the bust.

420
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,727
I just... I feel terrible.

421
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:34,383
You two used to date.

422
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,744
- What?
- No... What?

423
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:37,043
No. Ye... Well, yes, but...

424
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,680
I'm not judging. You're very pretty.

425
00:17:39,236 --> 00:17:40,573
Thank you.

426
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:42,782
Well, I'm not uncomfortable at all,

427
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:45,621
and I think we should
probably go, right?

428
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,347
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

429
00:17:48,786 --> 00:17:50,853
So, are you counting Bianca
as your first C.I.?

430
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:52,563
Shouldn't I?

431
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,892
Got a solid arrest off her intel.

432
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:55,431
Yeah, but Grey's also evaluating

433
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:57,325
long-term prospects and
she doesn't have any.

434
00:17:57,362 --> 00:17:58,462
Right.

435
00:17:58,499 --> 00:17:59,689
Ever bother you

436
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:01,431
- using people like that?
- Nope.

437
00:18:01,468 --> 00:18:03,342
The drugs she's moving
kill people every day.

438
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:04,819
She's not a saint.

439
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:06,856
- She's a criminal.
- Right.

440
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:09,193
You didn't answer my question.

441
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:11,213
You checking that box and moving on?

442
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,532
No. I need to find a real C.I.

443
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:15,087
Good answer.

444
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:22,488
So, where's your mom?

445
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:24,227
Uh...

446
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:26,660
she died last year.

447
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,262
Cervical cancer.

448
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:31,916
Oh. I'm sorry.

449
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:33,334
Thanks.

450
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:36,804
So, I left school to be with my dad,

451
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:38,078
only to find out

452
00:18:38,115 --> 00:18:40,040
that he'd been hooking up
with that trophy skank

453
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,976
while my mom was in hospice.

454
00:18:42,238 --> 00:18:45,584
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
go home tonight,

455
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:47,217
once you process out.

456
00:18:47,311 --> 00:18:49,112
I don't have a choice.

457
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:50,655
Daisy convinced my dad

458
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,284
to hold on to the money my mom left me

459
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:55,225
until after I graduate from college.

460
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,931
Can he do that?

461
00:18:57,225 --> 00:18:58,413
I don't know.

462
00:18:58,547 --> 00:19:01,187
I can't really afford a lawyer
to find out.

463
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,301
Look, you are in a bad situation,

464
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:07,624
but stealing, it's...

465
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:10,308
it's not gonna make it better.

466
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,365
What will?

467
00:19:13,225 --> 00:19:15,476
Am I crazy, or was that way too easy?

468
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:16,755
It was a little easy.

469
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,014
On the other hand, you showed Hickey

470
00:19:18,051 --> 00:19:19,279
that you can get things done.

471
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:22,316
Lopez, West, my office.

472
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:24,521
I'm gonna call you back.

473
00:19:25,151 --> 00:19:28,086
So, this is Special Agent
Wyck Bird from the FBI.

474
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:30,190
He says you're trying
to poach his informant.

475
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:32,359
Wait, sir, I-I can explain.

476
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:33,524
Save your breath.

477
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:34,828
Hickey's mine.

478
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:37,197
Guy's a clearinghouse
of high-value intel.

479
00:19:37,287 --> 00:19:39,772
Bureau doesn't need the LAPD
messing with our meal ticket.

480
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:42,069
I didn't know informants
came with exclusive rights.

481
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,523
Now you do.

482
00:19:44,374 --> 00:19:47,260
He called you to get us to back off.

483
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:49,670
And he used us to do him a solid.

484
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:51,078
Now he's kicking us to the curb.

485
00:19:51,112 --> 00:19:52,250
He said you were hassling him.

486
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:53,841
Stop hassling him.

487
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:55,412
Or else.

488
00:19:55,881 --> 00:19:57,006
Sergeant.

489
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:58,544
Special Agent.

490
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:02,272
- Sir...
- Save it.

491
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,092
I told you what would happen
if you swung and missed.

492
00:20:05,514 --> 00:20:06,894
You're dismissed.

493
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:13,260
So, you got a game plan
for running down a new C.I.?

494
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,454
Not yet. Any suggestions?
Oh, that's right.

495
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:16,624
You're not here to teach me.

496
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:17,889
Ms. Harper?

497
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,142
Hi.

498
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:22,117
Uh... um, what are you doing here?

499
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,334
You didn't sign your petition.

500
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:24,764
Right. I'm sorry.

501
00:20:24,796 --> 00:20:26,704
- I, um...
- Excuse me. Hi. John Nolan.

502
00:20:26,741 --> 00:20:27,975
Hi. Good to meet you. My name's...

503
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,180
None of his business.

504
00:20:29,217 --> 00:20:31,249
Um... I'm gonna take 10,

505
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:33,213
you figure out a next step.

506
00:20:33,352 --> 00:20:34,852
Come on.

507
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,120
This is bleak.

508
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,350
There's nowhere else we can meet?

509
00:20:41,387 --> 00:20:42,778
It's private.

510
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,659
I don't want anyone here
knowing my business.

511
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,570
Okay.

512
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,218
We got lucky with the judge.

513
00:20:53,467 --> 00:20:55,092
He believes whenever possible,

514
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,872
it's important for the mother
to be part of the child's life.

515
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,084
Okay.

516
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:01,834
That's... That's great.

517
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,945
How's it going here?

518
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:16,585
Uh, it's fine.

519
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:23,514
It's a lot harder than
I thought it would be.

520
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:25,701
What is?

521
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:27,373
Being normal.

522
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:30,749
You're doing great.

523
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:33,554
The better hours, the new apartment...

524
00:21:33,674 --> 00:21:35,676
the judge will be impressed.

525
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,625
I hope so.

526
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:40,828
'Cause if I don't see my daughter soon,

527
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:42,699
I am gonna lose my mind.

528
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:48,796
Hey.

529
00:21:49,195 --> 00:21:51,592
- Hey, back at it already?
- Yeah, couldn't sleep.

530
00:21:51,626 --> 00:21:53,348
Just laid there,
staring at the ceiling.

531
00:21:53,385 --> 00:21:55,419
Figured screw it...
I'll clock in early.

532
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:57,270
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

533
00:21:57,307 --> 00:21:58,953
I need to recruit a C.I.

534
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:01,358
My first one... she O.D.'d on me.

535
00:22:01,395 --> 00:22:02,645
Oh.

536
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,308
You know what? You need a forger.

537
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,206
They're at the hub of
all criminal activity.

538
00:22:06,562 --> 00:22:08,392
Tell Logan in Commercial Crimes

539
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:10,589
I asked him to throw
some names your way.

540
00:22:10,735 --> 00:22:12,937
You are a life-saver. Thank you.

541
00:22:13,187 --> 00:22:15,070
- Hey, John?
- Yeah?

542
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,485
I ran a background check
on Henry's girlfriend.

543
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,654
Don't worry, I tied it
to an open investigation.

544
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,156
No one will ever know.

545
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:23,977
- I-I didn't ask...
- I know.

546
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:25,593
I know.

547
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:27,206
But if I were you...

548
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,646
I'd want to take a look
at what's inside.

549
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:35,539
What's that?

550
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,042
Nothing, what was your thing about?

551
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,873
- Nothing.
- Great. Lunch?

552
00:22:39,908 --> 00:22:41,141
Great.

553
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:43,865
So, what do I do?

554
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:45,348
Open it.

555
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,174
It's about Henry's safety.

556
00:22:47,211 --> 00:22:49,045
You should see what it says.

557
00:22:52,168 --> 00:22:53,751
- Dad.
- Hey!

558
00:22:53,788 --> 00:22:54,945
Oh, my God, you guys are all

559
00:22:54,982 --> 00:22:56,523
about the surprises this week.

560
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:58,435
Hi, I'm Abigail... Henry's fiancée.

561
00:22:58,472 --> 00:23:00,040
Yeah, I know.

562
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:01,935
I just really love saying that, so...

563
00:23:01,972 --> 00:23:03,772
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, that's awesome.

564
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:04,732
What do you want to eat?

565
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:06,300
- I'll come with you.
- Okay. Good.

566
00:23:06,334 --> 00:23:07,768
- We'll be back.
- Right.

567
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:11,605
May I take your order?

568
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:14,033
They look so happy. I want that.

569
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,450
- Baby steps.
- Right.

570
00:23:15,487 --> 00:23:18,081
Well, first, I have to get
my mother out of our apartment.

571
00:23:18,183 --> 00:23:19,613
- Yes.
- They really do seem happy.

572
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:23,458
Would I be sabotaging that

573
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:24,995
by reading what's in this envelope,

574
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:27,011
or is that the illusion,

575
00:23:27,048 --> 00:23:30,057
and Abigail's just a time bomb
waiting to go off?

576
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:33,319
So, what's the next step
on the C.I. front?

577
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:35,498
Forger.

578
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:37,503
- Who'd you get that from?
- No one.

579
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,404
Detective Armstrong.

580
00:23:39,441 --> 00:23:40,834
Cheating on me with another detective?

581
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:43,237
I had no idea we were exclusive.

582
00:23:44,211 --> 00:23:46,786
Okay, we got too much,
but everything looked so good.

583
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:48,355
Perfect timing, uh, uh,

584
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:49,510
Henry, Abigail,

585
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:51,278
this is Nyla Harper,
my training officer.

586
00:23:51,312 --> 00:23:52,688
Nyla Harper, Henry is my son.

587
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:53,886
And I know what you're thinking...

588
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:55,289
far too young to have a 20-year-old.

589
00:23:55,326 --> 00:23:57,080
Nope. Nice to meet you both.

590
00:23:57,117 --> 00:23:58,752
- Let's get to work.
- Right.

591
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:01,598
Um, that's all you.
See you guys at home.

592
00:24:02,227 --> 00:24:03,594
So, you got a place to start,

593
00:24:03,631 --> 00:24:04,967
or are we Googling "forger"?

594
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:06,972
- Ooh, I got a list.
- Mm.

595
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,048
What did you think of Abigail?

596
00:24:10,085 --> 00:24:11,619
She seemed nice. Why?

597
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,012
No reason.

598
00:24:13,506 --> 00:24:14,640
They just got engaged.

599
00:24:14,674 --> 00:24:15,880
Oh, good for them.

600
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,371
Yeah.

601
00:24:17,477 --> 00:24:18,609
- No?
- Yeah.

602
00:24:18,646 --> 00:24:19,939
No, I'm...

603
00:24:20,146 --> 00:24:21,783
- Yeah, it's great.
- Oh.

604
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,283
No, eh, eh...

605
00:24:25,383 --> 00:24:27,286
- Drunk driving...
- Knock, knock.

606
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,470
Officers.

607
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,472
Can I help you?

608
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:33,050
Beat it.

609
00:24:37,554 --> 00:24:38,834
This is your place?

610
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,332
Yes, sir.

611
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:42,434
- You do head shots?
- We sure do.

612
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,703
What about fake IDs?

613
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,600
No, sir.

614
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:55,422
Lying to a police officer...
that's a crime, isn't it?

615
00:24:55,576 --> 00:24:57,315
Not as big a one as forgery

616
00:24:57,352 --> 00:24:59,842
and counterfeiting
government documents.

617
00:25:00,758 --> 00:25:02,567
Just trying to make a living.

618
00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:05,556
These cellphone cameras
have killed my business.

619
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:09,111
- Am I going to jail?
- Well, that depends.

620
00:25:09,482 --> 00:25:13,346
Maybe I can help you if you help me.

621
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:15,834
I don't know what that means.

622
00:25:16,227 --> 00:25:17,414
Do you want me to bribe you?

623
00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:19,204
- How much...
- No. No. No.

624
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,264
That's not... Okay. How do I...

625
00:25:22,608 --> 00:25:25,276
I need someone with their ear
to the street...

626
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:27,212
- You're gonna be his snitch.
- My snitch.

627
00:25:27,391 --> 00:25:29,515
We're gonna take all this
stolen property as evidence.

628
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:31,850
We're gonna book it and tie it
to an unknown suspect.

629
00:25:32,025 --> 00:25:33,469
If you screw us,

630
00:25:33,506 --> 00:25:35,940
we will suddenly know
who the suspect is,

631
00:25:35,977 --> 00:25:38,223
get a warrant, and come arrest you.

632
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,759
We are looking for leads
on serious felons here, okay?

633
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,607
Not teenagers trying to buy alcohol.

634
00:25:42,735 --> 00:25:45,043
You making papers for anyone
like that right now?

635
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,761
I did get a heads-up

636
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:50,565
about a big job that might come my way.

637
00:25:50,602 --> 00:25:52,237
Fake identities, driver's licenses,

638
00:25:52,272 --> 00:25:53,572
passports, the works.

639
00:25:53,606 --> 00:25:56,166
As soon as you get details,
you call me.

640
00:25:56,203 --> 00:25:57,710
Do you understand?

641
00:25:57,744 --> 00:25:59,178
Yeah.

642
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:01,246
Congrats.

643
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:03,349
You have a real C.I.

644
00:26:06,347 --> 00:26:08,019
I'm on my way home now, Mom.

645
00:26:08,056 --> 00:26:10,224
Yes, I got the shopping list
you texted.

646
00:26:10,808 --> 00:26:12,848
There's no milk because
I'm lactose intolerant,

647
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:14,386
remember?

648
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:16,261
Mom, I gotta go.

649
00:26:16,587 --> 00:26:18,458
Opal, what's up?

650
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:22,561
Thank you.

651
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,304
- Tim.
- Yo?

652
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,398
Olivia showed up at Opal's pawn shop

653
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:28,664
with more of her stepmom's stuff,

654
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:30,115
but she didn't want money this time.

655
00:26:30,201 --> 00:26:31,646
She wanted a gun.

656
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:43,097
Police!

657
00:26:46,158 --> 00:26:47,728
7-Adam-19... shots fired

658
00:26:47,765 --> 00:26:49,394
at our location, send backup.

659
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,454
I hate you!

660
00:26:55,491 --> 00:26:56,636
Drop the gun!

661
00:26:56,673 --> 00:26:58,089
You turned my dad against me!

662
00:26:58,126 --> 00:26:59,331
Olivia, drop the gun!

663
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,203
- She ruined everything!
- Now!

664
00:27:04,672 --> 00:27:06,945
Stand up. Keep your hands up.

665
00:27:06,979 --> 00:27:08,628
Do not move.

666
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,317
You've made this so much worse.

667
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:14,949
Come on.

668
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,958
You are gonna pay for those bags.

669
00:27:17,995 --> 00:27:19,622
Ma'am, stay right there.

670
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:20,952
What's going on?

671
00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:22,356
What the hell are you doing here?

672
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:24,183
I came to get the rest of my things.

673
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,841
Wh... Are you okay?

674
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:31,563
Officers, would you like to see

675
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,168
where Mrs. hides all her drugs?

676
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:35,569
Yes.

677
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:37,661
Yes, we would.

678
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:52,490
I'm home!

679
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:57,295
About time.

680
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:58,728
It's way past your curfew.

681
00:27:58,765 --> 00:27:59,995
Oh, very funny.

682
00:28:00,032 --> 00:28:03,167
You have a lot of tattoos.

683
00:28:03,345 --> 00:28:04,681
Oh, yeah. You like 'em?

684
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,512
Each one signifies
a meaningful moment of my life.

685
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,652
I'm trying to talk Henry
into getting one.

686
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,009
I have no idea what I would get.

687
00:28:11,043 --> 00:28:12,610
Yeah, well, that's a decision

688
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:13,922
that will last you a lifetime.

689
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:15,511
- Yeah.
- Oh, I see what you did there,

690
00:28:15,548 --> 00:28:17,115
Is anyone hungry?

691
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:22,164
I can tell you're freaked out.

692
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:24,484
Don't be, okay?

693
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:27,084
- Okay.
- Okay.

694
00:28:39,572 --> 00:28:41,805
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's John.</i>

695
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:43,675
I really hope I'm not, um...

696
00:28:43,912 --> 00:28:44,979
stepping over the line here,

697
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:48,212
but I really have no one
to talk to about... anything

698
00:28:48,247 --> 00:28:49,581
parenting-oriented.

699
00:28:49,618 --> 00:28:51,399
<i>Never mind. You know what?
I'll take care of this.</i>

700
00:28:51,436 --> 00:28:53,771
- <i>Just forget I called.
- John, how can I help?</i>

701
00:28:53,968 --> 00:28:56,206
I'm having a parenting emergency.

702
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:58,356
Good thing I specialize
in emergency medicine.

703
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,910
Are you still at the hospital?

704
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,352
<i>Yeah, for a couple more hours.</i>

705
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:03,776
Could I come buy you a cup of coffee,

706
00:29:03,813 --> 00:29:05,602
- <i>ask you some questions?</i>
- Of course.

707
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,927
Thank you.

708
00:29:07,964 --> 00:29:10,084
I'm just gonna head right
back out for a little while.

709
00:29:10,121 --> 00:29:11,829
- Okay.
- Oh, could you pick up some pie?

710
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:14,134
- Yeah, she loves pie.
- I love pie.

711
00:29:14,604 --> 00:29:16,018
Sure.

712
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:20,584
I feel like a monster.

713
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,317
You're not a monster.

714
00:29:22,414 --> 00:29:24,015
I mean, you're a father.

715
00:29:24,365 --> 00:29:26,521
So, I should just open this up
right now and read it?

716
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:27,874
Absolutely not.

717
00:29:27,942 --> 00:29:29,676
But it's my job to protect him.

718
00:29:29,713 --> 00:29:31,694
It is your job to respect him,

719
00:29:31,756 --> 00:29:33,356
and running secret
background check on the girl

720
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:34,936
he's in love with is not doing that.

721
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,305
Okay, but I didn't run this.

722
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:38,086
- Doesn't matter.
- No, no.

723
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:39,452
Of course not.

724
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:42,186
And yet I still can't
bring myself to throw it away.

725
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:45,585
What if you read it?

726
00:29:45,622 --> 00:29:46,983
And then that way,
you could just tell me,

727
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:47,929
if she's a serial killer

728
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:49,483
or a mime.

729
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,427
No, but I will throw it out for you.

730
00:29:51,464 --> 00:29:52,660
But...

731
00:29:53,366 --> 00:29:54,913
It's the right thing.

732
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:58,319
Hey, if you want to know
something about Abigail,

733
00:29:58,592 --> 00:30:00,258
you should just ask her.

734
00:30:04,178 --> 00:30:05,488
You're right.

735
00:30:06,936 --> 00:30:08,336
Thank you.

736
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:10,051
You're welcome.

737
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:15,061
I messed up.

738
00:30:15,334 --> 00:30:17,764
I tried to regain
all the ground I lost,

739
00:30:17,801 --> 00:30:19,911
but it might have just cost me my job.

740
00:30:21,537 --> 00:30:23,679
You know, Lucy would tell me about you,

741
00:30:23,716 --> 00:30:24,886
at the academy,

742
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:28,331
how far ahead you were
from all your classmates.

743
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,538
Seems so long ago.

744
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:32,834
What happened to <i>that</i> Jackson?

745
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:35,897
What happened to that young man
I met at graduation?

746
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,462
So full of confidence.

747
00:30:38,955 --> 00:30:42,925
A lifetime of expectations
crashed headlong into reality.

748
00:30:43,381 --> 00:30:46,708
Well, "Sometimes you win,
sometimes you learn."

749
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:49,199
Freud?

750
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:51,377
Cat poster Lucy used
to have in her room.

751
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:52,850
You need to get back to the time

752
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:54,707
when you knew who you were,

753
00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:57,319
not who you were trying to be.

754
00:30:59,588 --> 00:31:01,022
Oh, my gosh.

755
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:02,917
You're absolutely right.

756
00:31:02,954 --> 00:31:04,922
I can't start counting
up wins and losses

757
00:31:04,959 --> 00:31:06,586
when the season's just begun.

758
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:08,043
Morning.

759
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,063
Where did the coffee cups go?

760
00:31:10,206 --> 00:31:12,796
Oh, I moved them
next to the coffee maker.

761
00:31:13,048 --> 00:31:15,449
I liked them by the dishwasher.

762
00:31:15,686 --> 00:31:17,194
That's ridiculous.

763
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:18,634
It is more convenient.

764
00:31:19,625 --> 00:31:21,100
Did... Did...

765
00:31:22,472 --> 00:31:24,339
Did you rearrange the furniture?

766
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:25,472
Yes.

767
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,724
There's a better flow
in the room this way.

768
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:30,256
That's...

769
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,270
That's great.

770
00:31:34,384 --> 00:31:36,316
You know what? Screw the FBI.

771
00:31:36,458 --> 00:31:38,493
I'm gonna flip Hickey,
take him away from the Feds,

772
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,084
and show Grey that he's wrong about me.

773
00:31:40,147 --> 00:31:41,828
That's a really bad idea...

774
00:31:41,865 --> 00:31:43,164
but I love it.

775
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:44,886
- Yes.
- How you gonna pull it off?

776
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:46,759
Okay, I-I stopped by the men's

777
00:31:46,796 --> 00:31:47,952
detention center on the way in,

778
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,314
spoke to Chandio, and it turns out,

779
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:51,087
he's not sleeping
with Hickey's ex-wife.

780
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:52,201
He's never even met her.

781
00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:53,267
So, Hickey had another reason

782
00:31:53,304 --> 00:31:54,447
to torpedo the stolen car ring.

783
00:31:54,484 --> 00:31:56,311
Exactly. So, we find out what that is,

784
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:58,130
and we can use it to leverage Hickey.

785
00:31:58,848 --> 00:32:00,477
They made contact last night.

786
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:04,178
Ordered, um, five full sets
of fake documents.

787
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:06,271
All young women?

788
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,938
Yeah.

789
00:32:08,341 --> 00:32:10,259
- Human trafficking?
- Yeah.

790
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:11,891
Who's the buyer?

791
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:13,257
Cartel.

792
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:14,561
Not sure which one.

793
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:19,253
But they'll kill me if they
find out I'm talking to you.

794
00:32:19,653 --> 00:32:21,133
Where's the exchange taking place?

795
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:23,538
Uh, Whiteman Airfield.

796
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:26,030
In two hours.

797
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,375
You sure he said noon?

798
00:32:38,449 --> 00:32:39,875
Yeah, I wrote it down.

799
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,360
7-Adam-15...

800
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:44,773
all units stand by off-site.

801
00:32:45,026 --> 00:32:46,159
Target is running late.

802
00:32:46,196 --> 00:32:47,879
Hold position until further notice.

803
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:49,080
You think he's gonna show?

804
00:32:49,114 --> 00:32:50,648
If there's one thing you can count on,

805
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:52,417
it's that criminals are always late.

806
00:32:57,745 --> 00:32:59,420
What?

807
00:32:59,834 --> 00:33:02,103
- Nothing.
- What?

808
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:04,095
Trent Silver.

809
00:33:04,217 --> 00:33:05,272
Name of the lawyer,

810
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:06,870
you were talking to
at the precinct yesterday.

811
00:33:06,906 --> 00:33:08,875
I checked the sign-in
sheet at the front desk.

812
00:33:09,134 --> 00:33:10,720
Why would you do that?

813
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,637
I'm a cop.

814
00:33:12,671 --> 00:33:14,089
Curiosity's part of
the job description.

815
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:15,306
So, he does family law?

816
00:33:15,341 --> 00:33:16,808
He's none of your business.

817
00:33:16,948 --> 00:33:18,976
My personal life is
none of your business.

818
00:33:19,073 --> 00:33:20,373
Why you're back in uniform?

819
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,448
None of your business. Are we clear?

820
00:33:23,761 --> 00:33:25,231
For now.

821
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,481
Son of a...

822
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:37,812
Didn't someone from the FBI
call and talk to you guys?

823
00:33:38,245 --> 00:33:40,325
- I'm already taken.
- Yeah, about that.

824
00:33:40,362 --> 00:33:41,866
After we swept up those stolen cars

825
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,501
and shut down that dealership...

826
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:44,836
And learned that you were lying

827
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,504
about the owner
sleeping with your ex...

828
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:47,790
It got us thinking.

829
00:33:47,827 --> 00:33:48,894
So we did some digging,

830
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:51,642
and it seems that you paid
a visit to a few businesses

831
00:33:51,677 --> 00:33:53,188
in that neighborhood yesterday evening.

832
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:54,775
Tried to use our show
of force as a means

833
00:33:54,812 --> 00:33:57,058
to extort some
hardworking men and women.

834
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,813
We've got you on extortion.

835
00:33:59,993 --> 00:34:01,226
We own you.

836
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:03,608
So, call the FBI and let them know

837
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:05,580
that you are booked
for the foreseeable future.

838
00:34:05,617 --> 00:34:06,791
Okay.

839
00:34:06,977 --> 00:34:08,359
Alright, sure.

840
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:10,739
But I need to know how much
you're gonna pay for tips.

841
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:12,971
- That's a fair question.
- Totally.

842
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:14,142
The answer is...

843
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,384
- Zero.
- Zero.

844
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:25,627
Hello?

845
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,034
- I read it.
- <i>Read what?</i>

846
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:29,319
Wait... the background check?

847
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,253
No. You threw that away. I saw you.

848
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,368
I couldn't help myself.

849
00:34:32,405 --> 00:34:34,445
I mean, I dug it out of
the trash after you left.

850
00:34:34,654 --> 00:34:35,916
No. Why?

851
00:34:35,953 --> 00:34:37,774
You're supposed to be
the angel on my shoulder.

852
00:34:37,873 --> 00:34:39,392
But I started thinking.

853
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:42,285
I mean, if this was my son,
what would I do?

854
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:43,589
And then the next thing I knew,

855
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,000
<i>I was tearing it open
and reading what was inside.</i>

856
00:34:46,164 --> 00:34:48,447
I-Is it bad? What does it say?

857
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:52,360
Two years ago,
Abigail was charged with arson

858
00:34:52,397 --> 00:34:54,012
and use of a caustic substance

859
00:34:54,049 --> 00:34:56,096
against a former boyfriend.

860
00:34:56,513 --> 00:34:58,080
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

861
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:03,389
Nolan. Heads up.

862
00:35:03,426 --> 00:35:05,327
I have to go.

863
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:09,095
7-Adam-15... target has arrived.

864
00:35:09,151 --> 00:35:11,182
Single black SUV. Wait for our signal.

865
00:35:11,361 --> 00:35:12,432
Nice and easy.

866
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:14,580
Just go give them the documents.

867
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:29,959
Police! Hands where I can see them!

868
00:35:30,105 --> 00:35:32,562
Get out of the car! Do it now!

869
00:35:33,158 --> 00:35:35,058
No, please. You're making a mistake.

870
00:35:35,097 --> 00:35:36,777
- Are you being held against your will?
- Not by him.

871
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:38,870
He's helping us escape.

872
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:42,482
Wait. Escape from who?

873
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:43,682
El Leon.

874
00:35:43,717 --> 00:35:46,402
- Head of the Aquino Cartel?
- He's my husband,

875
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,340
and these woman "belong" to his men,

876
00:35:48,377 --> 00:35:50,504
but we're finished,
putting up with the abuse.

877
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,021
You have to let us go.

878
00:35:52,057 --> 00:35:53,107
Ugh.

879
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,460
- Who is that?
- It's my husband.

880
00:35:54,494 --> 00:35:55,814
He keeps calling,
telling me to go back.

881
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:56,853
You brought your phone?

882
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,557
Guaranteed he's tracking that.

883
00:35:59,168 --> 00:36:00,699
We gotta get out of here.

884
00:36:07,204 --> 00:36:08,405
Get behind us.

885
00:36:08,442 --> 00:36:10,535
7-Adam-15, converge on me. Code 3.

886
00:36:20,756 --> 00:36:23,245
Anybody raises the gun
above their waist

887
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:25,383
gets a hollow point in the eye.

888
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,064
There's no need for that.

889
00:36:28,137 --> 00:36:30,205
We're simply here to give
the ladies a ride home.

890
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,288
- You the husband?
- Nah.

891
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:33,916
I'm his attack dog.

892
00:36:34,002 --> 00:36:35,898
Elena, why do you do this?

893
00:36:35,935 --> 00:36:37,677
You know there's no place to go.

894
00:36:37,714 --> 00:36:39,408
Get in the car. All of you.

895
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:41,743
- We won't.
- Oh, yes, you will.

896
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,080
No, they won't.

897
00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:45,429
Huh. There's eight of us...

898
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,714
...and two of you.

899
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,882
Actually, there's
a whole lot more than two.

900
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,199
So, here's the new plan...

901
00:36:53,265 --> 00:36:54,732
You, your boys

902
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:55,863
are gonna get back in your cars

903
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,090
and you're gonna drive away,

904
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:58,240
empty-handed.

905
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:02,837
I'd say you got about 20 seconds
before the cavalry arrives.

906
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:04,499
This isn't over, Elena.

907
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:06,198
We'll get to you soon enough.

908
00:37:25,825 --> 00:37:26,952
Well, that was exciting.

909
00:37:26,989 --> 00:37:28,054
I guess not for you.

910
00:37:28,091 --> 00:37:29,532
That's probably
a regular Tuesday for you.

911
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:32,735
Oh, no, the pucker factor
was definitely at 11.

912
00:37:37,693 --> 00:37:39,264
West!

913
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,208
Nolan, Chen, don't wander off.

914
00:37:42,017 --> 00:37:44,217
- Special Agent Bird just called me...
- Look, Sergeant,

915
00:37:44,253 --> 00:37:45,844
it was my decision to pursue Hickey

916
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:47,238
and try and steal him away
from the Feds.

917
00:37:47,272 --> 00:37:49,740
Seems like you succeeded
from the way Bird was yelling.

918
00:37:49,818 --> 00:37:50,984
Yes, sir.

919
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:54,378
Officer Lopez, is this
how you train your rookies?

920
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:57,240
To ignore the orders of federal agents?

921
00:37:57,382 --> 00:37:58,813
Pretty much, sir.

922
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:03,656
Any day we can remind
our federal brethren

923
00:38:03,693 --> 00:38:05,482
that we are their equals...

924
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:08,133
is a day worth living.

925
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,014
It appears you three successfully

926
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:13,703
recruited your first C.I.s,

927
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,632
and I'm impressed.

928
00:38:17,514 --> 00:38:19,042
See you tomorrow.

929
00:38:19,216 --> 00:38:20,838
Oh, Officer West?

930
00:38:21,951 --> 00:38:23,435
Short sleeves, please.

931
00:38:24,106 --> 00:38:25,459
Yes, sir.

932
00:38:33,951 --> 00:38:36,185
Hey, why's your bag by the door?

933
00:38:36,482 --> 00:38:38,256
Your father is on his way
to pick me up.

934
00:38:38,854 --> 00:38:40,209
He apologized.

935
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,759
He just needed to miss me.

936
00:38:41,794 --> 00:38:43,394
Oh.

937
00:38:43,818 --> 00:38:44,976
He's downstairs.

938
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:47,893
Alright, sweetheart,
it's been a lovely visit.

939
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:49,495
Come by the office.

940
00:38:49,576 --> 00:38:51,369
We can talk about why
you're not dating anyone.

941
00:38:52,255 --> 00:38:53,554
Thank you, Jackson.

942
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:55,327
Bye, Mrs. Chen.

943
00:38:56,108 --> 00:38:58,643
No wonder I can't find
a healthy relationship.

944
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:02,780
My dysfunctional parents are why
I am 28 and still single.

945
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,577
Are you sure that's why?

946
00:39:05,317 --> 00:39:06,951
What's that supposed to mean?

947
00:39:06,985 --> 00:39:08,373
Look, I'm just saying

948
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,212
that your only real relationship
was with Nolan.

949
00:39:12,524 --> 00:39:14,101
- Yep. I've known the whole time.
- Wait...

950
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:15,938
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What? You think I'm stupid?

951
00:39:15,974 --> 00:39:18,031
- No.
- Listen, you fell for a divorced guy

952
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:19,990
coming out of a 20-year marriage.

953
00:39:20,027 --> 00:39:21,332
Okay? I-It was safe.

954
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:23,023
Never meant to last.

955
00:39:24,294 --> 00:39:25,523
Come on. Let's go celebrate.

956
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,471
Tomorrow, my forearms
will be liberated.

957
00:39:27,506 --> 00:39:28,931
It is pretty glorious.

958
00:39:28,968 --> 00:39:30,880
Yeah, actually, how <i>did</i> you
get your parents to make up?

959
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:33,344
Oh. I got Wesley to call each of them

960
00:39:33,378 --> 00:39:34,671
pretending to be a divorce lawyer,

961
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,981
telling them the costs of a divorce,

962
00:39:37,147 --> 00:39:38,749
and that snapped them out of it
pretty quick.

963
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:40,256
- Well played.
- Thank you.

964
00:39:40,293 --> 00:39:41,513
- Let's go.
- Wait.

965
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:44,038
Will you please, please help me

966
00:39:44,075 --> 00:39:46,168
get the furniture back to where it was.

967
00:39:46,304 --> 00:39:48,739
- But it's better this way.
- I know.

968
00:39:48,926 --> 00:39:51,462
But will you help me get it
back to the way it was?

969
00:39:51,997 --> 00:39:54,090
Yes.

970
00:39:54,127 --> 00:39:55,200
Oh.

971
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:56,559
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

972
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:57,785
Thanks.

973
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:02,175
Guys, there's something I need to say.

974
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:04,083
I know about the arson.

975
00:40:04,523 --> 00:40:05,924
You ran a background check?

976
00:40:06,169 --> 00:40:07,546
You knew she had a record?

977
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:09,528
Yeah, she told me on our third date.

978
00:40:09,572 --> 00:40:11,419
I... can't believe you did that.

979
00:40:11,464 --> 00:40:12,965
It's okay.
He... He did it to protect you.

980
00:40:13,002 --> 00:40:14,794
No, I don't need protecting,

981
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:16,274
especially from you.

982
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,910
Do you want to know what happened?

983
00:40:22,394 --> 00:40:24,295
If you want to tell me.

984
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:30,465
An ex-boyfriend posted
some videos on the Internet...

985
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,737
after we broke up.

986
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,661
Personal videos of us...

987
00:40:37,924 --> 00:40:39,264
together.

988
00:40:41,366 --> 00:40:43,534
He did it to get revenge,

989
00:40:43,959 --> 00:40:45,978
and it worked.

990
00:40:47,184 --> 00:40:50,131
He took something from me
I'll never get back.

991
00:40:54,594 --> 00:40:56,360
I'm so sorry.

992
00:40:56,596 --> 00:40:59,026
So, I went to his house...

993
00:41:00,328 --> 00:41:03,642
and I... torched his car.

994
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:08,080
And I got arrested and he didn't.

995
00:41:13,628 --> 00:41:15,132
Happy now?

996
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:19,218
Not in the least.

997
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:24,748
Abigail...

998
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:32,766
...I'm sorry my fear
overcame my judgement.

999
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:34,763
I, uh...

1000
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,584
I can't take that back,

1001
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:38,576
but I can promise you

1002
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:40,666
it won't happen again.

1003
00:41:43,743 --> 00:41:45,595
That's good enough for me.

1004
00:41:51,554 --> 00:41:52,854
Yeah.

1005
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:57,905
Okay.

1006
00:41:58,195 --> 00:42:00,883
It's great that that's behind us now,

1007
00:42:01,228 --> 00:42:03,517
because I really am pregnant.

1008
00:42:04,931 --> 00:42:06,401
I'm kidding. Again.

1009
00:42:06,438 --> 00:42:07,600
- Oh, my...
- Joke.

1010
00:42:07,634 --> 00:42:08,734
Geez.

1011
00:42:08,768 --> 00:42:10,563
Okay, we're gonna have
to work on the jokes, though.

1012
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,271
'Cause I already have
a high-stress job,

1013
00:42:12,305 --> 00:42:15,089
and, uh... I think you're gonna
give me a heart attack.

1014
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:16,643
Understood.
