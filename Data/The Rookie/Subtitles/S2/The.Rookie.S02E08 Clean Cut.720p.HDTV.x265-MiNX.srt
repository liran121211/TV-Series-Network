As much as I like
watching you load the truck,

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,846
I've got some studying
I got to do.

5
00:00:08,846 --> 00:00:11,043
And by studying,
you mean...?

6
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:13,357
Mm, watching "Lady
and the Tramp" with Abigail.

00:00:13,357 --> 00:00:16,140
Oh!
We do the, uh, whole
spaghetti thing along with it.

00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,456
Cute.
So, what are you doing
for your birthday tomorrow?

9
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:19,777
I'm tiling the bathroom.

10
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:21,398
Mm. That sounds sad.

11
00:00:21,398 --> 00:00:22,600
No, it doesn't.

12
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,792
Besides, when you're
the oldest rookie,

13
00:00:23,792 --> 00:00:25,204
you really don't
want anyone knowing

00:00:25,204 --> 00:00:26,943
you're the older

I mean, you just broke up
with Jessica,

and nobody knows that
it's your birthday tomorrow?

17
00:00:31,126 --> 00:00:32,448
Yes, and that's the way
I like it,

Jackson and Lucy.

You're a grown man.

I'm excited to get started
on my special assignment.

29
00:00:58,872 --> 00:01:00,810
It's not a special assignment.
It's a mandatory callback.

00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,503
Oh. I may have renamed that
in my head.

31
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:04,914
What happened here?

32
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:06,942
It's a homicide --
and a brutal one.

33
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:08,810
At least two assailants,
and the victim was a lawyer.

34
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,300
So lots of suspects.

35
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,073

building's security guard.

00:01:14,394 --> 00:01:16,501
Maynard Goetz.
Want me to put out an APB?

38
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:19,284

Just sit here and guard.

Not yet. Sorry.

51
00:02:05,156 --> 00:02:07,352
You know, Nolan kept me up
all night

52
00:02:07,352 --> 00:02:08,972
from this crime scene
he was babysitting.

53
00:02:08,972 --> 00:02:10,830
Look at this.
Look.

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,275

Class A's?

00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,238
Yeah. Tim and I get
our commendation today.

58
00:02:19,238 --> 00:02:21,971
Oh, right, for helping
that family last week.

59
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:23,382
Mm-hmm.

60
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:24,703
You know,
it's -- it's crazy.

61
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:26,065
Like, a few weeks ago,
I thought I was gonna get

62
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:27,356
bounced from the program,

63
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,666
and now I'm getting an award
from the Deputy Chief.

64
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:32,942
It's pretty cool
how quickly things can change.

65
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:34,432
I'm really happy
for you, man.

66
00:02:34,432 --> 00:02:36,420
Aww. Thanks.

67
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,242
Plus, Tim is gonna be
in a really good mood today.

68
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,230
I know.
I'm really happy for me, too.

69
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,155
Sorry.

70
00:02:45,155 --> 00:02:47,193
Let me get this straight.

71
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:49,627
You're coming to me
for an annual evaluation

72
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:50,959
that's not due
until December?

73
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,449
I just wanted to get
a jump on it.

74
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:54,019
Reason?
It's personal.

75
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,255
I figured
I'd spare you the details.

76
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:58,123
Detective, I hear you.

77
00:02:58,123 --> 00:02:59,943
I really do.

78
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:02,386
But it's called a yearly review
for a reason --

79
00:03:02,386 --> 00:03:05,368
because that's when
the Paperwork Gods expect it.

80
00:03:05,368 --> 00:03:08,558
So, if you want me to file
this thing ahead of schedule,

81
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:09,671
I need to know why.

82
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,070
Okay. Okay.

83
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,753
It's...for the judge.

84
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:18,576
I have a hearing next week
for custody of Lila,

85
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:21,348
and a strong evaluation
would go a long way.

86
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,075
Look, you came here
untouchable.

87
00:03:25,075 --> 00:03:26,446
Let me level with you.

88
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:30,421
While I'd fast-track reviews
for most of my officers...

89
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:31,782
I'm not ready
to do that for you.

90
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,436
Okay.

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,162
Wait.

92
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:44,453
I know you're trying hard
with your daughter.

93
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:46,520
At the same time,
I can't ignore

94
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,422
that you're still
a wildcard on patrol.

95
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:50,992
So, if you want this eval,

96
00:03:50,992 --> 00:03:52,363
you got to show me
something different.

97
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:53,516
What do you mean?

98
00:03:53,516 --> 00:03:55,175
Meaning...

99
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:56,497
we ride together.

100
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:59,478
You and me.
And I evaluate you firsthand.

101
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:01,516
But know this --
I'm writing this evaluation

102
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:02,956
no matter what happens
out there.

103
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:05,202
So, if you fall down today,
the world will know.

104
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:10,828
It is a big deal.
"Light of the City" award?

105
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:11,900
I thought
you'd be happier.

106
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,441
I planned my emotional day
around it.

107
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:15,259
I don't do this for the medals
and plaques, Boot.

108
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:16,790
Yes, only lesser cops
enjoy recognition.

109
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,241
Exactly.

110
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:19,522
Well, if it doesn't matter,
turn it down.

111
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:23,626
It doesn't matter to me, but it
does matter to the higher-ups.

112
00:04:23,626 --> 00:04:25,406
Look, a good score
on the sergeant's exam,

113
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:27,850
this award could help me rise
through the list of candidates.

114
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,635
Fair enough.

115
00:04:30,623 --> 00:04:32,322
Jackson's dedicated
an entire shelf to his award?

116
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:34,677
He's building a cabinet
from scratch.

117
00:04:34,677 --> 00:04:35,801
He knows how to do that?

118
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,043
Nolan's helping him.

119
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,682
Oh.

120
00:04:54,513 --> 00:04:55,507
Grace.

121
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:56,828
What's up?

122
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,985
You know, the usual.

123
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:01,141
Snatching life
from the jaws of death?

124
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:04,660
Close. I just pulled four Legos
out of a kid's nose.

125
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,558
Four? Amateur.

126
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:08,098
No commitment
to the craft.

127
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:09,747
I mean, not like
when we were kids.
Right.

128
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,695
I never went to the hospital
for anything less than seven.

129
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:12,858
Man on P.A.:
Dr. Sawyer to ER.

130
00:05:12,858 --> 00:05:14,010
Shoot. You know what?
I got to go.

131
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,303
Dr. Sawyer to ER.
I-I just --

132
00:05:15,303 --> 00:05:17,370
I wanted to wish you
a happy birthday.

133
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,532
Oh. Thank you.

134
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:19,893
Ga-- Uh, wait.

135
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,253
You remembered
my birthday?

136
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,770
I got a Facebook alert.

137
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,181
My birthday's
not on Facebook.

138
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:31,163
Huh.

139
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:33,389
That's weird.

140
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:35,377
Anyway, uh, lives, important
things. I-I got to go.

141
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,125
Grace.

142
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,030
Yeah?

143
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:40,802
Thanks for calling.

144
00:05:43,456 --> 00:05:45,234
You're welcome.

145
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:45,980
Right.

146
00:05:48,594 --> 00:05:49,706
Oh, damn it.

147
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,617
Sorry.
This is a crime scene.

148
00:05:57,617 --> 00:06:00,141
Better be.
Uh, bioremediation.

149
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,208
Beg your pardon?
Crime scene cleaner.

150
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:03,957
Right.

151
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:05,031
You the log officer?

152
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,601
Yeah.
Officer Nolan.

153
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:09,006
Um...crime scene's been
processed,

154
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:10,745
but they haven't
cleared it just yet.

155
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,020
I can have someone call you
when they're ready.

156
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,471
I'll wait.

157
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:16,667
90% of the job's
planning anyway.

158
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,701
You --

159
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:18,565
Thanks.

160
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:23,077
I would've thought 90%
of the job would be scrubbing.

161
00:06:23,077 --> 00:06:25,114
No.

162
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:26,357
No.

163
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:27,639
You go in
with the wrong chemicals,

164
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,378
you can make things
a hundred times worse.

165
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:31,862
The mix of body fluids
and the -- the fabrics,

166
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:34,178
even the ambient humidity,
it all makes a huge difference.

167
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,052
Oh.

168
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:37,288
Every job requires

169
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:39,315
a slightly different
set of tools.

170
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,637
Very impressive.

171
00:06:40,637 --> 00:06:44,284
And how does one
get into bioremediation?

172
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,418
Always liked
setting things right, I guess.

173
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:50,366
I walk into a tragedy.

174
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:53,348
When I walk out,
everything is as it should be.

175
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,157
I-I know people think
it's a weird job for weirdos.

176
00:06:58,157 --> 00:06:59,608
No, no, no.
I get it.

177
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:02,499
Your name again was...?
Ellroy.

178
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:04,199
Ellroy.
Nice to meet you.

179
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,107
Nice to meet you, too,
Officer Nolan.

180
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:10,201
Hmm.

181
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:15,627
You hungry?

182
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:16,660
Starving.

183
00:07:18,032 --> 00:07:19,394
Half a sandwich?

184
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:32,939
Whew.

185
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:35,671
Well, it's a little early
to become my first DUI,

186
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,202
but it's Hollywood.

187
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:38,275
Everyone's trying
to be someone.

188
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:39,517
It's not a DUI yet.

189
00:07:39,517 --> 00:07:42,459
Nope. But it will be
in three, two...

190
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:43,701
one.

191
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,590
Control, 7-Adam-15.

192
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,396
Show us on a possible DUI,
6th and Beverly.

193
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,175
Morning, Miss.

194
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:56,371
Can I speak to you
over on the sidewalk, please?

195
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:58,319
What? Why?

196
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,178
Uh, you just don't look like
you should be driving.

197
00:08:00,178 --> 00:08:02,662
Have you, uh, been drinking
a little bit?

198
00:08:02,662 --> 00:08:06,190
Got me there,
but I-I wasn't gonna drive.

199
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,459
Oh, so you were just getting
into your car because...?

200
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,069
Just grabbing my purse.

201
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:13,683
Mm-hmm. Your purse
that's on your shoulder?

202
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:14,796
Ah!

203
00:08:14,796 --> 00:08:16,366
It is!
Yeah.

204
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:17,946
Uh, uh, I'm just gonna
run a few tests

205
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:20,103
to make sure you are
actually okay to drive.

206
00:08:20,103 --> 00:08:22,667
I'm kind of sick of tests,
to be honest with you.

207
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,694
I know.
This will only take a second.

208
00:08:24,694 --> 00:08:25,807
So,
hold your head still.

209
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:27,844
Follow my finger
with just your eyes.

210
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,564
Horizontal nystagmus.

211
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,704
Okay. Hey, hey!

212
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,469
My dad's coming down
for the ceremony.

213
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:43,367
It's not a ceremony. It's a
photo op with the Deputy Chief.

214
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,185
Okay, still,
it's a big deal to me.

215
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:46,517
I'm proud of this.
You should be.

216
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:50,204
You know you were texting
while driving, sir?

217
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:51,645
Oh, I just looked down
at my map for a second

218
00:08:51,645 --> 00:08:52,767
while I was stopped
at a red light.

219
00:08:54,129 --> 00:08:55,381
"Yo, running late.

220
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:58,562
Smiley face, smiley face,
boat."

221
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:00,430
Yeah, okay,
the boat was a typo.

222
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,619
Yeah, it's so hard to focus
on texting while you're driving.

223
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:05,110
License and registration,
please.

224
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,191
Hey, what's, uh, what's going on
with your dashboard, there?

225
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,892
Nothing.

226
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:13,925

227
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:15,833

No. I'm fine.

278
00:11:11,318 --> 00:11:14,915
Be advised,
it's a city vehicle.

279
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:16,237
Coming up with a plan of action?
Deciding what to clean first?

280
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:18,721
No. I'm grading
the forensic team's work.

281
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,014
Looks like
Tip Johnson's guys.

282
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:22,200
I give them a B-plus.

283
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:25,310
How can you tell that?

284
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,755
They swab for DNA
and then lift prints,

285
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:29,245
which is the correct way
to do it.

286
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:31,143
Gil River's team
always prints first.

287
00:11:31,143 --> 00:11:32,436
And they work outside in.

288
00:11:32,436 --> 00:11:34,175
That is incredible.

289
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:36,073
You know the habits
of all the FSU teams?

290
00:11:36,073 --> 00:11:37,404
Most of them.

291
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:39,550
Oh, look at this.
Yeah.

292
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,916
Yeah, uh,
fingerprint powder here

293
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,863
means someone was trying
to hold the door shut

294
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:46,179
while someone was trying
to push their way in.

295
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,540
So, this is
where it started.

296
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,657
And obviously,
they got in.

297
00:11:49,657 --> 00:11:51,566
See the blood drops?

298
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:52,967
If the blood drops
are circular,

299
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,451
that means the victim
was standing still.

300
00:11:55,451 --> 00:11:58,561
Wait, you can...
tell if the person

301
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:00,459
was moving or not
based on the shape of the drops?

302
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:01,871
Exactly.

303
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:03,898
The faster they move,
the more elongated the drops.

304
00:12:03,898 --> 00:12:05,727
So, the narrow part of the drop
will indicate

305
00:12:05,727 --> 00:12:07,048
the direction
the person ran.

306
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:08,459
You are a natural!

307
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,109
So, um,
it started here.

308
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,351
He's bleeding,

309
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,587
he's running,
he's...bleeding.

310
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:15,077
A stu-- stutter step.

311
00:12:15,077 --> 00:12:16,697
"Am I gonna get away?"

312
00:12:16,697 --> 00:12:18,109
They caught him.

313
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:20,881
He went down, and they beat him
something terrible.

314
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:23,077
Looks like
they dragged him.

315
00:12:23,077 --> 00:12:24,807
He probably grabbed
ahold of the bookshelf

316
00:12:24,807 --> 00:12:26,387
and pulled it down.

317
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:30,610
And then...

318
00:12:31,564 --> 00:12:32,717
Wow.

319
00:12:34,377 --> 00:12:36,364
That's a $20,000
bottle of tequila.

320
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,854
That's worth more than
all the low-rent furniture

321
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:39,097
in this place.

322
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:41,333
Maybe it was a gift.

323
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,152
You know, when I worked
in construction,

324
00:12:43,152 --> 00:12:45,557
I never drove a nice truck
to go bid on a job.

325
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,335
Made the client think
you were charging too much.

326
00:12:47,335 --> 00:12:50,147
Maybe he's just trying
to hide his money.

327
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,835
Tequila will get grass stains
out of white jeans.

328
00:12:55,454 --> 00:12:56,527
Oh.

329
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,457
That's not good.

330
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:03,941
Sorry, the gruesome murder scene
just got not good?

331
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:05,103
There's blood
on the windows,

332
00:13:05,103 --> 00:13:07,001
but there's not much
on the desktop.

333
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:09,158
So, there was something
on the desktop.

334
00:13:09,158 --> 00:13:09,983
Uh-huh.

335
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:13,670
The victim
was on the desktop.

336
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,657
You know what makes holes
like that?

337
00:13:19,175 --> 00:13:20,507
Those are nail holes.

338
00:13:22,365 --> 00:13:24,522
They nailed him
to the desk.

339
00:13:24,522 --> 00:13:26,221
And they tortured him.

340
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:28,407
There's only two reasons
to torture someone.

341
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:29,898
You hate their guts.

342
00:13:29,898 --> 00:13:31,310
Or you want them
to tell you something.

343
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,720
Or it's a sex thing.

344
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,833
So, three things.

345
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,364
I'm super uncomfortable.

346
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,965
We're handling it, Sarge.

347
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:42,578
That's a lot of cops
for a fender bender.

348
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:45,928
Officer-involved accidents
are very serious.

349
00:13:45,928 --> 00:13:47,170
Someone's getting
a day at the beach.

350
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,811
Day at the beach?

351
00:13:51,811 --> 00:13:53,132
Suspension
without pay.

352
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,000
One of the many possible
discipline options.

353
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,027
I could be demoted,
kicked out of field training.

354
00:13:57,027 --> 00:13:58,766
No point in taking
the sergeant's exam.

355
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,693
Things just keep
getting better.

356
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:04,809
♪ 'Round and 'round ♪

357
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:08,327
♪ The wheels on the bus
go 'round and 'round ♪

358
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:09,489
You two okay?

359
00:14:09,489 --> 00:14:11,020
Yeah. Fine.

360
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,630
Shop's not.

361
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,458
What happened?

362
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:15,820
I lost focus.

363
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,558
The car just
suddenly stopped.

364
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:19,219
And the other driver?

365
00:14:19,219 --> 00:14:20,580
Uh, taken to the hospital.

366
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,234
Might have whiplash.
Possible concussion.

367
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:25,430
It's probably best
you sit out the ceremony today.

368
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:28,908
Of course.

369
00:14:28,908 --> 00:14:30,229
Can't have the Deputy Chief
handing a plaque

370
00:14:30,229 --> 00:14:32,097
to an officer
facing demotion.

371
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:34,791
I'll need a collision memo
on this by end of shift.

372
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,591
Given the liability
implications,

373
00:14:39,591 --> 00:14:41,578
you should go to the hospital,
in order to head off

374
00:14:41,578 --> 00:14:43,436
any questions
about your fitness to drive.

375
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:45,185
Have them do
a full work-up

376
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:47,123
and prove
that you weren't impaired.

377
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:48,406
Yeah, I'll do that.

378
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:49,160
Thanks.

379
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:53,583
I'm so sorry, Tim.

380
00:14:54,915 --> 00:14:56,654
Follow our shop
back to the garage.

381
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:58,641
Transfer our gear to a new one,
pick me up at the hospital.

382
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:00,132
Okay.

383
00:15:04,305 --> 00:15:05,846
Arrest report done.

384
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:07,049
Eager to get
back out there?

385
00:15:07,049 --> 00:15:09,980
Oh, I do have to add
the CHP 180.

386
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,305
180.
That is so weird.

387
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:13,419
It's like a full turn.

388
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:15,038
He did a 180.
Wow.

389
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:16,896
I wonder if that was a
coincidence or something that --
Jackson?

390
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:18,099
Yeah?
What are you
talking about?

391
00:15:19,471 --> 00:15:21,697
Paperwork.
Like, uh, formats.

392
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:23,356
The data, you know?

393
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,727
Have you ever really sat
and thought about

394
00:15:24,727 --> 00:15:26,754
how much data
we actually collect?

395
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:29,647
Like, terabytes and terabytes
of data our whole lives.

396
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:31,226
Actually, we carry
more data on our phone

397
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:32,926
than they ever processed
on Apollo 11.

398
00:15:32,926 --> 00:15:33,920
Fact.

399
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,744
Why don't you
come with me?

400
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:35,868
Where?

401
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,471
Come on.
Why are you so rough?

402
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:39,842
Come on.
Occupied.

403
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:41,830
It's like
an airplane bathroom.
Let's go in here.

404
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,690
Hey, what are you doing?
Look to the left.

405
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,350
Okay, look,
you don't understand.

406
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,169
That kind of computing power
and all our data,

407
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:54,789
we are just
a few years away

408
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,975
from being able
to predict crime.

409
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:58,386
Look to the left.

410
00:15:58,386 --> 00:16:00,791
Okay.
Now.

411
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:03,027
Now right.

412
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:04,517
It's like a couple
flying saucers in there.

413
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:05,760
What?

414
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,192
Oh, my gosh.

415
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,293
I'm high.

416
00:16:14,862 --> 00:16:16,691
On drugs.

417
00:16:16,691 --> 00:16:18,182
I did drugs.
Not on purpose.

418
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:21,282
No, no, I-I don't do drugs.
I've never done drugs before.

419
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:22,981
Shocker.

420
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:24,473
7-Adam-07, go to Channel 2.

421
00:16:24,473 --> 00:16:26,212
Oh, God.
Grey knows. He knows.

422
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:28,577
No, he doesn't, but he will
if you don't play it cool.

423
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:31,389
What is it, Sarge?

424
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:32,671
You got Officer West
with you?

425
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:34,619
Yes, sir.
I'm here.

426
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,358
Sorry.

427
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:38,017
You'll be receiving
the special commendation alone.

428
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,587
Uh, from the Deputy Chief.
Right.

429
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:41,287
Why?
What happened with Tim?

430
00:16:41,287 --> 00:16:43,146
He's been involved
in an incident.

431
00:16:43,146 --> 00:16:44,725
He won't be attending.

432
00:16:44,725 --> 00:16:45,798
Copy that.

433
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:46,713
I'm dead.

434
00:16:48,203 --> 00:16:49,645
It's over. I --

435
00:16:49,645 --> 00:16:51,433
Is this what it feels like
to be dead?

436
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:52,795
It's not --
It's not bad.

437
00:16:52,795 --> 00:16:54,872
Look. Don't panic.
We'll get through this.

438
00:16:54,872 --> 00:16:58,300
Look, my dad will be there,
with the Deputy Chief.

439
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,632
Give me your weapon.

440
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:01,281
What? Why?

441
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,861
Because you can't have a gun
if you're high.

442
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:10,970
We're going to the hospital,
get your blood tested.

443
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,669
Keep your eyes forward
as we leave the station,

444
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,449
and don't talk to anyone.

445
00:17:15,979 --> 00:17:17,847
You can talk to me.

446
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:18,842
Copy that.

447
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:19,626
Come on.

448
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:28,530
So, that was
a nice gesture,

449
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:31,432
giving Tim advice
after the accident.

450
00:17:31,432 --> 00:17:34,205
"Team player" is a big part
of the evaluation.

451
00:17:35,408 --> 00:17:36,649
It is.

452
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:38,219
But I have a feeling
you would've did the same thing

453
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:39,879
whether I was watching
or not.

454
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:45,960
Excuse me.
That's my daughter.

455
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:49,479
Hey, honey.

456
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,059
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down. Slow down.

457
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:52,509
What? You got --
You got in where?

458
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,068
Oh. No, no,
of course I'm excited.

459
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:57,479
It's a great school.

460
00:17:57,479 --> 00:18:00,083
Yeah, call your mom,
and I will talk to you later.

461
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,189
Hey, congratulations.

462
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:04,177
Yeah.

463
00:18:08,072 --> 00:18:10,020
She got into Cornell.

464
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,544
And you don't
want her to go.

465
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:14,741
We settled on UCSB.

466
00:18:14,741 --> 00:18:16,857
Ah, that's close by.

467
00:18:16,857 --> 00:18:18,795
I went to Cornell.

468
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,206
Or was it Colgate?

469
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:25,215
Whee!

470
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:29,230
7-Adam-15.
We have a 415.

471
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,635
Shirtless man with a bat.

472
00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:33,165
Drop the bat.

473
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:35,281
I can't.
I need to protect myself.

474
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,314
From who?

475
00:18:36,314 --> 00:18:38,054
Zombies!

476
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:39,415
It's starting!
They're everywhere!

477
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:41,741
Drop the bat,
or we will shoot you.

478
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:43,311
I'm not gonna
let them bite me!

479
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:45,298
Hey. I get it.

480
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:46,500
Infection moves fast.

481
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,816
But we can protect you.

482
00:18:48,816 --> 00:18:51,012
Okay? Our car
is armor-plated.

483
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:52,920
They won't be able
to get in.

484
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,144
Hey, it's a hell of a lot safer
than being on the street.

485
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:59,131
But first, you have to
put down the bat.

486
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:07,042
Put your hands
behind your back.

487
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:08,364
Palms together.

488
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:09,476
Spread your feet.

489
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:13,869
Nice work.

490
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:14,903
And what's that one do?

491
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,522
Uh, the three B's --

492
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,589
blood, bile, and barf.

493
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:19,584
Nice.

494
00:19:19,584 --> 00:19:21,362
And this one?

495
00:19:21,362 --> 00:19:24,055
Oh, that's a proprietary blend
from Japan.

496
00:19:24,055 --> 00:19:26,251
It's the only thing that will
get brains out of a jute rug.

497
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:27,782
I had to sneak it out
through Guam

498
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:29,402
'cause it's pretty much
straight-up cancer.

499
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:35,026
Any guess as to when they're
gonna release the scene?

500
00:19:35,026 --> 00:19:37,014
No. It's getting
kind of ridiculous.

501
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:39,707
I mean, you got a job to do.
I got a birthday to salvage.

502
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:40,740
It's your birthday?

503
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,192
Yeah.

504
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:45,043
Control, this is 7-L-9
at the Grand Avenue homicide.

505
00:19:45,043 --> 00:19:47,289
Any word when they're gonna
clear this crime scene?

506
00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:48,482
Sorry.
Homicide's all backed up.

507
00:19:48,482 --> 00:19:49,972
Oh, I...I --

508
00:19:49,972 --> 00:19:51,960
Can I...?

509
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,987
Nell, it's Ellroy.

510
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:55,438
Hi, Ellroy!

511
00:19:55,438 --> 00:19:57,763
Glad you're on this one.
Sounds like a real doozy.

512
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,453
Oh, yeah!

513
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:02,355
This guy evacuated
out of every orifice.

514
00:20:03,557 --> 00:20:05,872
Uh, so, are you still planning
that trip to Borneo --

515
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:06,747
Hey, h-hold on.

516
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:11,587
Nell, I'm looking at some blood
outside the warranted area,

517
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:14,280
leading to another part
of the building.

518
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,142
Do you want me to alert
homicide detectives?

519
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:18,960
Yeah.
And forensics, too.

520
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:23,065
And let Sgt. Grey know

521
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:25,589
the security guard
they were thinking was in on it?

522
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:27,576
They can cancel
the APB.

523
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:28,362
We found him.

524
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:34,692
What this place
really needs --

525
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,063
it needs...some calming music,
you know?

526
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:40,158
Like, uh, monks chanting
or, uh, those whale songs.

527
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:41,986
That would be nice.

528
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:44,510
Um, he got some powder
on his face --

529
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,871
Mm-hmm.
white powder, and --

530
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,909
You need to find out
what drug he was exposed to.

531
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:49,767
The guy we stopped
had priors for PCP.

532
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:52,957
PCP is fat-soluble.

533
00:20:52,957 --> 00:20:55,024
I mean, that stays
in your system for a lifetime.

534
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:57,846
Exactly. And if you can
hallucinate at any time,
you can't carry a gun.

535
00:20:57,846 --> 00:20:59,665
It's an automatic retirement.
He'll be off the force.

536
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:01,196
I'll rush the tests.

537
00:21:01,196 --> 00:21:03,809
Wait, you don't have to
report this, right?

538
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:05,250
I'm precluded
by HIPAA laws

539
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,198
from discussing this
with anyone.
Good.

540
00:21:07,198 --> 00:21:09,474
If the test comes back positive,
I'll fill out an exposure form.

541
00:21:09,474 --> 00:21:11,918
But if it's nothing serious,
I want to keep it quiet.

542
00:21:11,918 --> 00:21:14,611
Imagine being able to stop crime
before it happens.

543
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:17,593
Mind-blowing concept
that I've actually sat with

544
00:21:17,593 --> 00:21:18,665
for a few days.

545
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:19,868
I pitched it --
Hey!

546
00:21:19,868 --> 00:21:21,935
What are you
doing here?
Nothing.

547
00:21:21,935 --> 00:21:23,426
I'm not following.
What were you saying?

548
00:21:23,426 --> 00:21:25,542
Nothing. Just some sci-fi movie
he won't stop talking about.

549
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:26,745
Go wait by the elevator.

550
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:29,935
Are you okay?
What happened?

551
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:31,753
I rear-ended a citizen.

552
00:21:31,753 --> 00:21:32,956
Bad?

553
00:21:32,956 --> 00:21:34,447
She's in the ER.

554
00:21:34,447 --> 00:21:35,977
I don't know
how it happened.

555
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:37,140
Just --

556
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,253
I got to go.

557
00:21:46,451 --> 00:21:48,150
Everything looks normal.

558
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,145
Great.

559
00:21:49,145 --> 00:21:50,595
People get in accidents.

560
00:21:50,595 --> 00:21:52,414
Even cops.

561
00:21:52,414 --> 00:21:54,192
What do they call it
when a doctor has an accident?

562
00:21:54,192 --> 00:21:55,813
Malpractice.

563
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:57,134
Well, we're both held
to a higher standard --

564
00:21:57,134 --> 00:21:58,625
for good reason.

565
00:21:58,625 --> 00:21:59,659
How is she?

566
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,750
The CT scan came back negative
for internal bleeding.

567
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,145
We'll keep her overnight
to make sure she's okay.

568
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:10,302
She asked for you
when they first brought her in.

569
00:22:10,302 --> 00:22:12,498
She doesn't blame you.

570
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,814
Go talk to her.

571
00:22:14,814 --> 00:22:15,688
Thanks.

572
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,344
How are you doing?

573
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,248
I'm okay.

574
00:22:25,248 --> 00:22:26,908
No.
No, you're not.

575
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:28,567
Do you know how much
this is all gonna cost?

576
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,306
The hospital bills
will be covered by the city.

577
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:31,588
So will the repairs
to your vehicle.

578
00:22:31,588 --> 00:22:33,039
You just think
that makes everything alright?

579
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,400
Mike, stop.

580
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,732
No, i-it's okay.
He has a right to be angry.

581
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:36,636
And I have a right
to sue.

582
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,539
We're not gonna sue.

583
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:40,820
You -- He didn't mean to hit me,
did you?

584
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,062
No, ma'am.

585
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:45,789
I hope
you feel better soon.

586
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,429
You got business here,
little lady?

587
00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:52,864
My T.O. and I were the ones
involved in this accident.

588
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,647
Oh, right.
The beach boy.

589
00:22:55,647 --> 00:22:57,137
He's screwed.

590
00:22:57,137 --> 00:22:59,493
Have you...looked
at the other car yet?

591
00:22:59,493 --> 00:23:00,408
Not yet.

592
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,219
There's something
I can't get out of my head.

593
00:23:03,219 --> 00:23:04,631
I-I don't remember
seeing brake lights.

594
00:23:05,664 --> 00:23:06,985
Uh-huh.

595
00:23:08,228 --> 00:23:09,639
Can you take a look?

596
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:10,842
Yeah, when I have time.

597
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:13,495
You've got time now.

598
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:14,529
This is important.

599
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:16,427
Officer Bradford
is a 12-year veteran.

600
00:23:16,427 --> 00:23:18,792
He's been wounded five times
in the line of duty.

601
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:20,074
He deserves your respect,

602
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:23,433
not whatever macho crap
this...is...

603
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:24,466
sir.

604
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:27,944
Okay.

605
00:23:27,944 --> 00:23:28,898
Let's take a look.

606
00:23:36,968 --> 00:23:39,204
Oh.
Taillights weren't on.

607
00:23:39,204 --> 00:23:40,238
How can you tell?

608
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:41,440
The brake lights
didn't work

609
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,139
because someone
pulled out the contacts.

610
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:44,342
Could that have happened
during the accident?

611
00:23:44,342 --> 00:23:45,584
No.

612
00:23:45,584 --> 00:23:47,521
These were pulled
on purpose.

613
00:23:47,521 --> 00:23:49,350
Why would they do that?

614
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,999
Insurance scams.

615
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,580
See it all the time.

616
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,809
Get someone to rear-end you
and collect the settlement.

617
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,459
Maybe your T.O.
isn't screwed after all.

618
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:59,118
What's that?
The powder?

619
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,799
Ah. Looks like your victim's
into all kinds of scams.

620
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:05,002
What do you mean?

621
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:07,159
Powder's, uh,
red phosphorous.

622
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:08,649
You know, the stuff
on the tip of matches?

623
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:09,930
Why would they have that?

624
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,332
Well, if they're not
cooking meth,

625
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:13,945
arsonists use it
to set fires.

626
00:24:13,945 --> 00:24:15,893
Harder to trace
than gasoline,

627
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:17,096
and you can make a fuse
with it.

628
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:25,543
Hey.
Hey.

629
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:26,775
You switch out
the shops?

630
00:24:26,775 --> 00:24:28,265
Uh, yeah,
but there's something else.

631
00:24:28,265 --> 00:24:29,428
The car was rigged.

632
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:30,800
What?

633
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,834
The brake lights
weren't connected.

634
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:33,403
This accident
wasn't your fault.

635
00:24:33,403 --> 00:24:34,983
No wonder
I reacted so slowly.

636
00:24:34,983 --> 00:24:36,385
The leads were
purposefully disconnected?

637
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:37,756
Yeah.
And there's more.

638
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:40,529
Sarah had arson materials
in the back of her car.

639
00:24:40,529 --> 00:24:42,676
Clearly, she's a bit
of a renaissance scam artist.

640
00:24:42,676 --> 00:24:44,086
Let's go talk to her.

641
00:24:44,086 --> 00:24:45,159
You rigged the car.

642
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:46,949
What?
No. I didn't.

643
00:24:46,949 --> 00:24:48,350
Dash cam says different.

644
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:50,387
So does a physical inspection
of your vehicle.

645
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:52,454
You searched my car?
I didn't give you permission.

646
00:24:52,454 --> 00:24:53,865
We don't need permission

647
00:24:53,865 --> 00:24:55,147
once it's been involved
in an accident.

648
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:56,926
I don't think you were
trying to get rear-ended
by a police car.

649
00:24:56,926 --> 00:24:58,665
Bad luck, honestly.

650
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,444
I don't know
what you're talking about.

651
00:25:00,444 --> 00:25:02,431
Sarah, this is serious.

652
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:04,876
Your vehicle's full of evidence,
all admissible against you.

653
00:25:04,876 --> 00:25:06,486
It's not mine.
Then whose is it?

654
00:25:06,486 --> 00:25:08,274
Your boyfriend? The guy who was
threatening to sue me earlier?

655
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:10,172
No.
What's his name?

656
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:11,336
I'm not gonna
tell you that.

657
00:25:13,074 --> 00:25:14,605
Emergency contact --
Mike Garvey.

658
00:25:14,605 --> 00:25:16,224
And a phone number.

659
00:25:16,224 --> 00:25:18,500
Just what we need
for a background check.

660
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,855
So you don't go anywhere
while we're running it.

661
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:27,315
Stay here
until I come back.

662
00:25:27,315 --> 00:25:28,438
If I could just talk
to the IT guys --

663
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:30,545
No.
No talking to anyone.

664
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:33,814
Well, look, maybe I am high,
but these are still solid ideas.

665
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:35,146
Okay.

666
00:25:35,146 --> 00:25:36,716
I'm cool.

667
00:25:36,716 --> 00:25:38,585
I will stay here,
and I will not talk to anyone.

668
00:25:38,585 --> 00:25:39,816
Great.

669
00:25:50,012 --> 00:25:51,702
Get it together.

670
00:25:51,702 --> 00:25:52,656
You're gonna be okay.

671
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:54,723
Just slow down...

672
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:56,422
and, uh...

673
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:57,337
take a breath.

674
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,483
What if the copier
could copy your thoughts?

675
00:26:18,246 --> 00:26:20,273
I think you should
interview him alone.

676
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:21,395
Why?

677
00:26:21,395 --> 00:26:22,886
Because he knows
I'm the one that hit her.

678
00:26:22,886 --> 00:26:24,208
He doesn't know
you were in the car with me.

679
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,241
His guard won't be up.

680
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,185
I need to be
at the hospital.

681
00:26:34,185 --> 00:26:35,349
Yes, sir.

682
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:36,918
We'll get you out of here
as quickly as we can.

683
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:38,578
And I wasn't even
in the car.

684
00:26:38,578 --> 00:26:40,645
I don't understand
why you have to talk to me.

685
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:42,423
It's...standard procedure.

686
00:26:42,423 --> 00:26:43,914
You can imagine
the paperwork

687
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:46,070
when an officer gets involved
in an accident.

688
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:49,798
That cop should be fired.

689
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:51,745
That is up to
the department.

690
00:26:51,745 --> 00:26:53,196
Do you and Sarah
live together?

691
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,935
Yeah. Why?

692
00:26:54,935 --> 00:26:56,138
Do you ever use her car?

693
00:26:56,138 --> 00:26:57,330
What difference
does it make?!

694
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,119
She was rear-ended.

695
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:01,305
Yes, sir. If you could
just answer the question.

696
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:03,591
Do you ever use her car?

697
00:27:06,364 --> 00:27:07,188
No.

698
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,914
Never?
Never.

699
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:12,903
So, you didn't
disconnect her taillights

700
00:27:12,903 --> 00:27:14,771
to commit insurance fraud?

701
00:27:14,771 --> 00:27:16,013
Nope.

702
00:27:17,662 --> 00:27:19,451
But you have
committed fraud before.

703
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:20,733
Isn't that true?

704
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:22,671
Arrested three times,
convicted once.

705
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:25,245
I'm out of here.

706
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:30,462
I know
what's going on here.

707
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:32,609
You're trying to intimidate me.
But it's not gonna work.

708
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,855
'Cause I'm gonna get a lawyer,
I'm gonna come back here,

709
00:27:34,855 --> 00:27:36,464
I'm gonna sue you
and the entire department.

710
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:41,553
Little advice -- if you can
only afford one retainer,

711
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:43,590
I'd start
with a criminal lawyer.

712
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:44,991
You're gonna need
that one first.

713
00:27:48,886 --> 00:27:50,625
Sorry I didn't
get more out of him.

714
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:53,398
Don't be. The point
was to wind him up.

715
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:54,849
First thing he's gonna do
is call Sarah

716
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:57,293
and wind her up
even more.

717
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:59,490
And then
we see who breaks first.

718
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,720
I've decided.
Dominique can go to Cornell.

719
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,499
We'll just move there.

720
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:06,069
Ithaca's a nice town.

721
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:07,479
It's 3,000 miles away.

722
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,338
That's a hell of a commute
to downtown L.A.

723
00:28:09,338 --> 00:28:10,789
I can get a gig there.

724
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:16,463
Luna's been begging me
to retire from the LAPD anyway.

725
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:18,123
So, you're gonna follow
your daughter to college?

726
00:28:18,123 --> 00:28:19,901
That's not crazy at all.

727
00:28:19,901 --> 00:28:22,426
This way, I am close by
if she needs me.

728
00:28:22,426 --> 00:28:23,589
Don't do it.

729
00:28:23,589 --> 00:28:25,408
My parents barely let me
out of their sight.

730
00:28:25,408 --> 00:28:26,610
Drove me crazy.

731
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,846
You got to let her
spread her wings.

732
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:30,167
Fly!

733
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,234
Disagree. Got to
keep your family close.

734
00:28:33,934 --> 00:28:35,176
Zombies take over the city,

735
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:36,915
you got to be able
to grab them and go.

736
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,071
The man with the nail bat
agrees with you.

737
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:41,675
Just, uh, you know,
take that in for a minute.

738
00:28:41,675 --> 00:28:44,369
Don't forget, I'm evaluating you
today, Detective.

739
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:45,650
Yes, sir.

740
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,558
Ithaca is lovely
this time of year.

741
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:51,613
Jackson?

742
00:28:53,859 --> 00:28:56,045
And you'd be at the nexus
of it all --

743
00:28:56,045 --> 00:28:57,665
dispatching units
to pre-crimes,

744
00:28:57,665 --> 00:29:00,477
and you'd use the copier
to help you.

745
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:02,673
Hmm.
Jackson!

746
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:04,293
We're supposed to be
handling calls.

747
00:29:04,293 --> 00:29:06,151
Okay. Yeah. We were just --
Well, we're just --

748
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:07,513
Let's go now.

749
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:09,302
Um, Officer Lopez?

750
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:10,454
Just one quick thing?

751
00:29:13,526 --> 00:29:14,559
Sure. What's up?

752
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,162
It's about Officer West.

753
00:29:17,162 --> 00:29:18,036
Yeah?

754
00:29:18,036 --> 00:29:20,561
I just wanted to say
that he is...

755
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:25,948
...such an insightful
thinker.

756
00:29:25,948 --> 00:29:28,303
I mean, did you know
he was full of ideas?

757
00:29:28,303 --> 00:29:29,714
I did not.

758
00:29:29,714 --> 00:29:31,532
He's usually much...
quieter.

759
00:29:31,532 --> 00:29:32,814
Hmm.

760
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:34,057
Nice to see you, Nell.
Mm-hmm.

761
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:38,945
Only one of you
is getting a deal.

762
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,357
And you want it
to be you.

763
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:45,276
I was about to leave him.

764
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:47,105
I went over to borrow
some suitcases from my sister.

765
00:29:47,105 --> 00:29:49,549
I-I didn't know that
he messed with my brake lights.

766
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:50,583
I swear.

767
00:29:52,232 --> 00:29:55,055
Why were you
leaving him?

768
00:29:55,055 --> 00:29:57,460
He's gone over the edge.

769
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,774
At first, it was
just staged accidents.

770
00:29:59,774 --> 00:30:01,841
We'd shake down
some rich losers for cash

771
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,829
or set a few fires for a cut
of the insurance money,

772
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:04,823
but now --

773
00:30:04,823 --> 00:30:05,817
But now what?

774
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:10,994
He's agreed to kill
some guy's wife

775
00:30:10,994 --> 00:30:13,191
for a cut
of the life-insurance policy.

776
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:16,340
And when is this murder
supposed to happen?

777
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,610
Later today.

778
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:28,842
Homicide is sending
another forensics team.

779
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:30,870
This place isn't gonna be
cleared for hours at this point.

780
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,858
You might as well
go home.

781
00:30:32,858 --> 00:30:34,060
I'm good.

782
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,833
Um, hey...

783
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,154
I was wondering...

784
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:41,225
what is Nell like?

785
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:42,547
Nell?
She's lovely.

786
00:30:42,547 --> 00:30:44,534
I mean, I-I've talked to her
a lot, you know,

787
00:30:44,534 --> 00:30:46,154
when dispatch calls me,

788
00:30:46,154 --> 00:30:48,260
but I've never met her
in person.

789
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,066
Is she pretty?
Yes.

790
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:54,551
You know, you could
come down to the station,
meet her face-to-face.

791
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:55,962
No. I couldn't.

792
00:30:55,962 --> 00:30:57,453
Uh...

793
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,925
Um...

794
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:03,286
she's busy.

795
00:31:03,286 --> 00:31:05,821
I -- Um, I'm busy.
We're busy.

796
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:06,854
I couldn't.

797
00:31:06,854 --> 00:31:07,967
Listen -- Nah.

798
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:11,286
Ta-da.

799
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,608
Happy birthday.

800
00:31:12,608 --> 00:31:14,516
Thank you.
That is...

801
00:31:14,516 --> 00:31:15,629
extremely thoughtful.

802
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:17,905
It's nothing.
Birthdays are important.

803
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:20,936
This is a treat.
It really is.

804
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:25,357
You okay?

805
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:27,226
Yeah.

806
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:29,710
I missed one.
My sister's.

807
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,777
Her last.

808
00:31:31,777 --> 00:31:33,596
Oh, I'm so sorry.

809
00:31:33,596 --> 00:31:35,216
She killed herself
that year.

810
00:31:35,216 --> 00:31:38,237
Um, at my parents' house.

811
00:31:38,237 --> 00:31:40,105
Ellroy, was that
your first crime scene?

812
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,080
I put everything
the way it was,

813
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,611
but nothing
has been right since.

814
00:31:49,755 --> 00:31:51,941
Ellroy, I don't even know
what to say.

815
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:53,471
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

816
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:56,452
It was a long time ago.

817
00:31:57,536 --> 00:31:59,354
Anyway...

818
00:31:59,354 --> 00:32:00,556
I think
I am gonna take off.

819
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:05,197
Uh, just...

820
00:32:05,197 --> 00:32:06,976
give me a heads-up whenever
they finally clear the scene.

821
00:32:06,976 --> 00:32:08,010
Of course.

822
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:09,133
Yeah.

823
00:32:09,133 --> 00:32:10,783
Alright.

824
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:14,718
Hey, Ellroy,
did you see this?

825
00:32:14,718 --> 00:32:15,791
What's that?

826
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:17,163
This vent.

827
00:32:17,163 --> 00:32:19,021
The screws have been practically
pulled out of the wall.

828
00:32:22,052 --> 00:32:23,870
What if the bookcase didn't
fall down in the struggle?

829
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,315
What if they moved it so they
could look inside the vent?

830
00:32:26,315 --> 00:32:30,161
Lawyers like this guy,
they deal in a lot of cash.

831
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:31,612
Maybe they knew
he kept it hidden here,

832
00:32:31,612 --> 00:32:33,311
and they tortured him
to find it.

833
00:32:33,311 --> 00:32:34,881
Well, it wasn't hidden
in the vent.

834
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:37,326
This thing's coated with dust.
Hasn't been touched in years.

835
00:32:37,326 --> 00:32:38,777
Must have kept looking,

836
00:32:38,777 --> 00:32:40,635
moved next door
into the raw space.

837
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,610
I don't think
they ever found it.

838
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:45,405
How do you know?

839
00:32:45,405 --> 00:32:46,438
Because they're back.

840
00:32:54,011 --> 00:32:55,213
LAPD!
Drop your weapons!

841
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:02,250
7-Adam-9 --

842
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,621
Oh, no.

843
00:33:09,374 --> 00:33:11,938
Okay, Ellroy, you're gonna move
to the raw space behind me.

844
00:33:11,938 --> 00:33:13,231
As soon as I say "Move."
Ready?

845
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,082
Move!

846
00:33:30,204 --> 00:33:31,735
Help me!
Oh, God.

847
00:33:37,866 --> 00:33:39,724
That's not gonna hold them
for long.

848
00:33:39,724 --> 00:33:42,378
Alright. Alright.
Okay, um...come on.

849
00:33:42,378 --> 00:33:43,540
Give me your phone.
Mine's dead.

850
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,399
Oh.
I have a pager.

851
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,843
Seriously?

852
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:50,199
He probably surprised them when
they were searching in here.

853
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:54,213
Okay.

854
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:56,658
Now we just have to
find a place to hide
till the cavalry arrives.

855
00:33:56,658 --> 00:33:58,029
Come on.
Over here.

856
00:33:58,029 --> 00:33:59,639
Right.
You stay right here.

857
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:00,554
By myself?

858
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:04,857
I'm bringing a pipe
to a gunfight?

859
00:34:04,857 --> 00:34:06,347
It's better
than bare hands.

860
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,466
Stay down! Do not move.

861
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:41,838
Stay down! Facedown!

862
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,481
Hands!

863
00:35:50,613 --> 00:35:51,567
Good work, Ellroy.

864
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:55,502
I'm glad I know how to clean
the stains out of trousers.

865
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:19,352
Freeze!

866
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:20,257
LAPD!

867
00:36:20,257 --> 00:36:21,837
Turn around!

868
00:36:21,837 --> 00:36:23,119
Drop your weapon!

869
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,530
Drop your weapon!

870
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,677
Keep your hands up!
Sidestep to the right!

871
00:36:26,677 --> 00:36:28,913
Keep going!

872
00:36:28,913 --> 00:36:30,940
Get down on the ground!
On your stomach!

873
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,977
Hands out to the side!

874
00:36:32,977 --> 00:36:34,627
Now, don't move!

875
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,992
Mike Garvey, you're under arrest
for attempted murder.
