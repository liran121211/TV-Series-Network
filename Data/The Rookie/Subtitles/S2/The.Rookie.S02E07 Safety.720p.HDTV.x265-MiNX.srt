00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:02,172
<i>- Eric Weddle with a tackle just shy...</i>
- Thattaboy, Weddle!

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,062
- Thattaboy, baby!
- <i>...of the first down marker.</i>

3
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:06,234
- Come on! One more!
- <i>Rams defense needs a stop here</i>

4
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:08,311
- One more stop, that's all we need.
- <i>to have any hopes of a win.</i>

5
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,079
One more stop.

6
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:13,141
<i>We're coming on
air live with a car chase</i>

7
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:14,815
<i>- in Los Angeles County.</i>
- Oh, come on!

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,617
<i>The driver has been eluding police</i>

9
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:18,452
<i>for the better part of a half-hour.</i>

10
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:28,720
Dispatch, Officer Tim Bradford.

11
00:00:28,757 --> 00:00:30,439
Badge 34831.

12
00:00:30,476 --> 00:00:33,778
Log me in for overtime in
pursuit of a high-speed suspect.

13
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:49,528
LAPD!

14
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,853
Put your hands outside the window!

15
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:55,099
Now open the door from the
outside, and step out of the car!

16
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:57,524
You sidestep over to your left,

17
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,263
face down on the ground,
arms out to the side.

18
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:02,768
- You got him?
- All good.

19
00:01:09,249 --> 00:01:10,483
<i>The ball is tipped,
intercepted by Weddle...</i>

20
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:12,690
- Yes! Run, Weddle! Run!
<i>- He's at the 20, the 10...</i>

21
00:01:12,757 --> 00:01:16,206
<i>Touchdown! Eric Weddle!</i>

22
00:01:28,134 --> 00:01:29,391
Um, I'm late.

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,444
Roger that.

24
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:32,969
- Breakfast is almost ready.
- No, no, no. I'm...

25
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,446
- I'm late.
- Okay, alright.

26
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,195
I'll just get you a... a coffee to go.

27
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:39,412
I've got a travel mug right here,

28
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,747
and you're...

29
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:44,711
- You're late, as in...?
- Yeah.

30
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:46,707
- Oh, boy.
- Or girl.

31
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:47,904
- How late?
- Three days.

32
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:49,793
Okay. That doesn't necessarily
mean you're pregnant.

33
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:50,827
There are two things in this world

34
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:51,845
that always run on time...

35
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,344
Swiss watches and my cycle.

36
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:55,845
Right.

37
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:57,386
Okay, um...

38
00:01:57,436 --> 00:01:58,570
Wha... Uh...

39
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:01,516
First, we should be absolutely sure.

40
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:04,367
Yes, okay.
Um... I've got a staff meeting

41
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,683
first thing this morning,

42
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,188
but I'll pick up a test on the way in,

43
00:02:08,237 --> 00:02:09,915
and I'll call you as soon as I know.

44
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,243
Okay, and...

45
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:13,345
and no matter what happens,

46
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:15,500
we'll make the best of this.

47
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,045
Okay.

48
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:26,037
I mean, talk about terrible timing.

49
00:02:26,086 --> 00:02:27,559
Though...

50
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,402
Henry was born at a
less-than-ideal time,

51
00:02:29,451 --> 00:02:31,376
and he's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

52
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:32,925
Not that I'm saying I
hope she's pregnant.

53
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:36,444
I... Not that I'm saying
I hope she's <i>not</i> pregnant.

54
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:39,585
What am I saying?

55
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:41,461
Just wish she would call.

56
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,896
How hard is it to pee on a stick?

57
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,216
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are... Are you talking to me?

58
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,852
- What's going on?
- Roll call.

59
00:02:49,214 --> 00:02:51,310
- Is everything alright?
- Hundred percent.

60
00:03:04,456 --> 00:03:06,224
Nice of you to finally
deign to sit with us.

61
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:08,483
Enh, the front row's
too close to the boss.

62
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:10,473
Lopez still out?

63
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:12,199
Yeah. Taking care of Wesley.

64
00:03:12,248 --> 00:03:13,515
She's got him back on his feet.

65
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:14,637
Good.

66
00:03:14,686 --> 00:03:16,356
Okay, listen up.

67
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:19,050
Why is community policing important?

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,233
Officer Chen?

69
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,768
Uh, because it builds trust

70
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,512
between the police and the public,

71
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,895
leading to a reduction in crime.

72
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,116
Exactly.

73
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:28,345
And today, we're gonna do
a little trust-building.

74
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:31,773
Officer Nolan, so,
you know Dr. Sawyer at Shaw Memorial?

75
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:33,096
Uh, we went - to the same college, sir.

76
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:35,411
Eh, before I got my now-ex
pregnant with my son and...

77
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,227
It was a yes or no question, Nolan.

78
00:03:37,303 --> 00:03:38,703
Sorry, sir. Yes, I know her.

79
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,845
Good. She requested an officer
to assist with a seminar.

80
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:43,304
- You're going.
- What kind of seminar?

81
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:44,486
Don't know, don't care.

82
00:03:44,535 --> 00:03:46,226
Whatever it is,
it's open to the public,

83
00:03:46,296 --> 00:03:49,122
which means you have a
chance to show the community

84
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:51,664
that the LAPD does more
than just lock up people.

85
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:52,856
We do?

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,398
That's not funny.

87
00:03:54,506 --> 00:03:56,819
And you don't want to piss me
off, Bradford.

88
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:58,716
Considering what I
have lined up for you.

89
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:01,289
- What's that?
- Watts Rams need additional coaches

90
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:02,504
for their fall clinic,

91
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:03,984
and you're gonna need company.

92
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,184
Officer West.

93
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:10,132
Your dad is always bragging

94
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:12,410
how you're a high-school football star.

95
00:04:12,468 --> 00:04:14,154
- Is he lying?
- No, sir.

96
00:04:14,265 --> 00:04:16,182
All-State safety, four years running.

97
00:04:16,231 --> 00:04:18,117
I could actually pull up my

98
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:19,684
highlight reel if you
want to check it out.

99
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,869
- It's on my YouTube channel.
- That won't be necessary.

100
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,953
Change into your PTs,
head out with Bradford.

101
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,114
Harper and Chen,

102
00:04:26,393 --> 00:04:27,868
you will serve as liaisons

103
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:29,750
to the Mid-Wilshire Community Council.

104
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:31,339
They're coming in for a sit-down.

105
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:33,006
What is this? The 1950s?

106
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,472
The boys go to football practice

107
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:36,894
while us girls attend a PTA meeting?

108
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:38,425
Fair point.

109
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:41,815
Guess there's really only
one way to settle this...

110
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,885
Challenge coins.

111
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:52,815
Chief gave me mine personally.

112
00:04:52,864 --> 00:04:54,003
That was nice.

113
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,063
Mine was given to me by the governor.

114
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:57,702
What is a challenge coin?

115
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:59,256
How do you not know that?

116
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:02,035
It's a medallion bearing
an organization's insignia,

117
00:05:02,263 --> 00:05:04,330
given only to those deemed worthy.

118
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,042
They're used to show respect

119
00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:07,729
or, uh, settle minor disputes.

120
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:11,381
Okay. Closest to the edge wins.

121
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,285
Oh!

122
00:05:34,225 --> 00:05:37,046
Alright. Harper, football's all yours.

123
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,939
Nah, Bradford can have it.

124
00:05:38,973 --> 00:05:40,622
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Nope.

125
00:05:40,671 --> 00:05:42,239
Only football I watch is English.

126
00:05:43,382 --> 00:05:44,484
Whatever.

127
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:46,400
Community Council will be here in 20.

128
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,261
Ma'am, would you like me to

129
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,470
prepare anything for the meeting?

130
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:51,166
Uh, coffee. Black.

131
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,619
- Officer...
- Uh, Chen. It's right there.

132
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:53,745
No, the only name I know,

133
00:05:53,794 --> 00:05:55,221
is Nolan's, and you are not him.

134
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:57,067
So today, you are Not Nolan.

135
00:06:00,901 --> 00:06:02,854
- I'm Not Nolan.
- It's often how I think of you.

136
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:03,964
Oh. Funny.

137
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:05,776
Do you have any advice on
how to get on her good side?

138
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,284
I actually don't know that she has one,

139
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,334
so good luck.

140
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,544
Hey, nice move.

141
00:06:27,623 --> 00:06:29,090
Ooh! Great hands.

142
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:32,025
That is AJ.
Most pure talent on the team.

143
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,793
Kid's gonna get recruited hard.

144
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:35,261
Oh, we don't care about that.

145
00:06:35,296 --> 00:06:36,989
When AJ joined us,
his grades were in the trash.

146
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,039
Now he's on the honor roll,
wants to go to college.

147
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:40,588
That's what we care about.

148
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:45,785
Hey, you, uh... you like that move?

149
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,216
It's alright against a 12-year-old.

150
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:48,557
You're gonna have to up your footwork,

151
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:50,006
when you get to real
competition, though.

152
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:52,178
Nah, I run footwork drills
every morning. I'll be ready.

153
00:06:52,258 --> 00:06:53,892
- And at night?
- Catching drills.

154
00:06:54,022 --> 00:06:56,717
Harder to see the ball,
increases hand-eye coordination.

155
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,172
- Any other questions?
- No, not at this time.

156
00:06:59,305 --> 00:07:00,766
AJ.

157
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:03,332
What is she doing here?

158
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:04,843
I'll be right back.

159
00:07:05,044 --> 00:07:06,520
His mom.

160
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,504
Just got released a few months ago.

161
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,296
Transition's been
rough on both of them.

162
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:12,067
- What was she in for?
- Armed robbery.

163
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:13,566
Pretty serious crew.

164
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,213
- It's Eric Weddle, man.
- Weddle, Weddle!

165
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:25,162
Hey. Can we play?

166
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,638
Weddle.

167
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:28,452
Tim Bradford, is that you?

168
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:29,591
You know him?

169
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,430
Man. We played against
each other in high school.

170
00:07:32,553 --> 00:07:35,321
I sacked Bradford so hard
in the championship game,

171
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,792
he decided Fallujah was
better than turning pro.

172
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:39,161
Yeah, smart man.

173
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,865
The NFL's only getting
harder and faster.

174
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:42,442
Yo, you're Robert Woods.

175
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:43,582
I have your USC jersey at home.

176
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:45,122
- Whoo!
- Me too.

177
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:46,705
Hey, man, great to have
you back in L.A., bro.

178
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:47,902
Good to be back.

179
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,086
- Alright.
- Great.

180
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,811
Alright. Thanks, guys.

181
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:55,395
Yo. You just bro-hugged Eric Weddle.

182
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,721
Don't make it weird.

183
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,469
You know, it's not about what you want.

184
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:00,527
- I got to do what I think is best.
- Oh, now it's about you?

185
00:08:00,576 --> 00:08:01,748
I don't want to go!

186
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,041
Everything okay?

187
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,102
AJ's dropping football.

188
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:07,450
Got a lot going on right now.

189
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,087
Come on.

190
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:16,050
...tops, and then we
go do <i>real</i> police work.

191
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,928
Oh, I see why you chose this.

192
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:19,682
Lowest impact on our day.

193
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:22,532
Yep. Community meetings
are quick and easy.

194
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:24,423
Just don't promise them anything.

195
00:08:24,488 --> 00:08:27,356
Whatever the complaint,
just nod and say,

196
00:08:27,405 --> 00:08:28,605
"We are aware of the problem,"

197
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:30,606
"and we have a task
force working on it."

198
00:08:30,655 --> 00:08:31,945
Ooh, a task force?

199
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,318
Yeah, these busybody types love it

200
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:34,862
when cops say "task force."

201
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:36,456
Okay. Well, I'll just follow your lead.

202
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:38,090
Oh, I'm not talking. <i>You</i> are.

203
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:41,899
- Wh... What?
- I don't do community meetings.

204
00:08:44,044 --> 00:08:45,181
Go on.

205
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,857
Yeah.

206
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,099
Okay.

207
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:52,987
Hi. Uh, I'm Officer Lucy Chen,

208
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:54,837
and the Mid-Wilshire Police Station

209
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:57,621
- is proud to partner with you today...
- There is no partnering with us,

210
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,990
until first you partner with the Earth.

211
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,722
- Oh, come on.
- What's LAPD doing

212
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:02,505
about the city's lack of
drought-tolerant plants?

213
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:03,754
Oh. Yes.

214
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:05,537
We are aware of this problem,

215
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,649
and we have a task force working on it.

216
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:10,361
Oh... Sweet.

217
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:14,211
Officer, can you do
something about my neighbor?

218
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,566
He's constantly feeding the squirrels.

219
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,773
Uh... yes.

220
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:23,217
We have a task force working on that.

221
00:09:23,276 --> 00:09:24,576
A squirrel task force?

222
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,992
- Yes, ma'am.
- This is serious.

223
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,192
Squirrels attract coyotes,
and I have small dogs.

224
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:31,437
And any time I try to
talk to my neighbor,

225
00:09:31,472 --> 00:09:32,840
he's just hateful.

226
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:35,057
I'm scared for the safety of my babies.

227
00:09:35,106 --> 00:09:38,778
Yeah. Uh, listen,
why don't you give me his address,

228
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:42,002
and I'll make sure that the
task force is following up.

229
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:45,070
Is there a task force
for abandoned cars?

230
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,893
There's one - in front of my apartment.

231
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:48,657
I'll give you my address.

232
00:09:50,563 --> 00:09:51,913
Hey, Jess, it's me.

233
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:53,696
I-I thought I would have
heard from you by now.

234
00:09:53,745 --> 00:09:55,106
Are you... Are you
still in your meeting?

235
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:57,397
Are you having trouble peeing?
Because the trick is to...

236
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,831
You know, I got to go.
Call me when you know.

237
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,045
- Hey, John.
- Hey.

238
00:10:00,124 --> 00:10:01,201
Appreciate you doing this.

239
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:02,538
My pleasure. What are we doing?

240
00:10:02,587 --> 00:10:03,652
- They didn't tell you?
- No.

241
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,235
Oh, we're hosting our
monthly free seminar.

242
00:10:05,284 --> 00:10:07,565
- Great. For who?
- Pregnant mothers.

243
00:10:12,397 --> 00:10:13,733
- What's wrong?
- Uh, nothing.

244
00:10:13,782 --> 00:10:15,468
I couldn't be more excited.

245
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:17,762
<i>How's Wesley?</i>

246
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,052
Driving me crazy.

247
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:20,145
He was stabbed.

248
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:22,194
Well, yeah, but it's not like
any major organs were damaged.

249
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:25,505
God, I miss cop humor.

250
00:10:25,554 --> 00:10:26,982
Corporate world is so buttoned up.

251
00:10:27,038 --> 00:10:29,209
Everyone's always
running scared of H.R.

252
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,687
- Is Stabby here?
- No.

253
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:33,116
His mom took him to physical therapy.

254
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:34,765
I was planning a spa day until you said

255
00:10:34,814 --> 00:10:36,658
I can make two grand for 8 hours' time.

256
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:37,770
Yep, and trust me,

257
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,734
you're gonna love -
working private security.

258
00:10:39,826 --> 00:10:42,405
I've done some moonlighting,
but nothing fancy like this.

259
00:10:42,572 --> 00:10:44,477
- Who am I guarding?
- Mingus Kemp.

260
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,379
He's a high-end - jewelry
broker from Vegas.

261
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,130
Comes to L.A.
every month to buy diamonds.

262
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,180
You'll keep him safe while our
driver runs you around town.

263
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:51,995
Anything else I need to
know about the protectee?

264
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:53,275
He thinks he's a player.

265
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:55,421
Inherited the business from his dad.

266
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,561
He'll hit on you a little,
but he's mostly harmless.

267
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,610
Okay. Uh... I still get paid

268
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:01,722
- if he gets killed, right?
- Yeah.

269
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:03,296
I wouldn't let him know that, though.

270
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:12,551
Hello, Ms. Clemons.

271
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:14,983
I'm Officer Bradford.
This is Officer West.

272
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,809
- We met at the, uh...
- I-I remember. What do you want?

273
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:17,959
Just want to make sure
everything's alright.

274
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:19,112
Pulled AJ off the team so fast,

275
00:11:19,146 --> 00:11:20,586
wanted to make sure
there wasn't a problem.

276
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:22,607
No problem. Thanks for stopping by.

277
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:25,011
- Everything okay, buddy?
- He's fine.

278
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,113
How about you?

279
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:28,058
You seem to be moving out in a hurry.
Something going on?

280
00:11:28,107 --> 00:11:29,975
Um, it's none of your damn business.

281
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:31,471
Actually, it is, Ms. Clemons.

282
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,154
You're still on parole
for armed robbery.

283
00:11:33,203 --> 00:11:34,270
Your P.O. know you're moving?

284
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,246
- So, what? You gonna violate me?
- No, nobody wants that.

285
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,592
We're just here to help.

286
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:45,422
Get down! Get down!

287
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,264
Control, 7-Adam-19.

288
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:54,481
We have a 246 with a
firebomb at our location.

289
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,864
Two masked suspects,

290
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:58,915
fleeing south on Gramercy
in a black Impala.

291
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,823
<i>So, you have no idea who they were?</i>

292
00:12:04,872 --> 00:12:06,817
- Not a clue.
- Come on, Ms. Clemons.

293
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:09,666
I mean, two masked suspects
and a Molotov cocktail...

294
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:11,418
that wasn't some
random act of violence.

295
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:12,787
You were targeted.

296
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:14,293
Tell me why.

297
00:12:14,556 --> 00:12:16,653
- Am I under arrest?
- Of course not.

298
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,156
Then can I go?

299
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:22,318
Not yet, look, I just need a list

300
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,327
of the personal property that
was damaged during the fire.

301
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,810
Hey, man. Hit me.

302
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:32,444
I wasn't gonna say it earlier,
but, uh...

303
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:34,246
you got some serious talent.

304
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,179
If you're running drills
every morning on your own,

305
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:37,279
you clearly love the sport.

306
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:38,733
Yes, sir.

307
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:42,316
I, uh... take this ball
with me everywhere I go.

308
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,769
Sounds like me.

309
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,891
You know, in some ways,
this game saved me.

310
00:12:48,223 --> 00:12:49,690
How?

311
00:12:51,717 --> 00:12:54,426
You know, growing up in my house was...

312
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,301
a bit chaotic.

313
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:57,825
Yeah, I, um...

314
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,533
I know a little something about that.

315
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,462
My old man had a hair trigger.

316
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,215
Never knew what would set him off.

317
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:05,554
And football was...

318
00:13:05,805 --> 00:13:07,930
the only place I had any control.

319
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,357
Yeah, I, um...

320
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,634
I know a little something
about that, too.

321
00:13:12,747 --> 00:13:15,549
Football taught me
discipline, teamwork.

322
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:17,271
It wasn't just a game.

323
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:19,454
Yeah?

324
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:21,980
And, uh, what game are we
playing right now, huh?

325
00:13:22,185 --> 00:13:23,502
We connect over sports

326
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:25,885
and then I talk about
my mom behind her back?

327
00:13:28,152 --> 00:13:29,961
I'd never ask you to do that.

328
00:13:31,422 --> 00:13:33,700
But, look, if you ever need anything...

329
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:36,389
just let me know, alright?

330
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:42,650
<i>You're too pretty to be a cop.</i>

331
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:44,578
Sir, I think we should
keep this professional.

332
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:46,396
Of course. Of course.

333
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:48,526
- How about a selfie?
- Sorry, that would compromise security.

334
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:50,475
Right. Right. Yeah.

335
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:52,289
No, um... you know, I knew that.

336
00:13:52,346 --> 00:13:54,021
That was... That was
...That was a test.

337
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:56,771
Hey, you want to see something?

338
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:05,065
By the end of today,
this will be filled

339
00:14:05,114 --> 00:14:08,602
with $2 million in diamonds, Angela.

340
00:14:10,281 --> 00:14:12,630
You ever seen, uh, $2 million before?

341
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,137
Saw 10 times that in a drug
raid in a cartel stash house.

342
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,479
Had a bunch of brains
scattered across it, though.

343
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:22,549
Cool. Yeah.

344
00:14:25,848 --> 00:14:27,387
<i>Control, 7-Adam-15,</i>

345
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:29,599
show us Premise Check, Code 6.

346
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:31,358
<i>Copy that.</i>

347
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:35,762
Okay, so...

348
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:38,213
According to Mr. Elson,

349
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:40,834
there are vagrants -
squatting in the storm drain.

350
00:14:41,358 --> 00:14:42,657
Great job.

351
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:45,673
We are about to go fishing
in the armpit of Los Angeles,

352
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,943
full of the complete
hepatitis alphabet,

353
00:14:48,977 --> 00:14:50,411
not to mention rats.

354
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:53,068
- You first.
- Okay, it's disgusting,

355
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:55,242
but isn't the whole point
of community policing to...

356
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:56,342
No, Not Nolan.

357
00:14:56,391 --> 00:14:57,851
The whole point of any kind of policing

358
00:14:57,886 --> 00:14:59,773
is to do what I tell you.

359
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:02,923
Trust me, you don't want to
be good at community policing.

360
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:05,659
- Why?
- Once the higher-ups see it,

361
00:15:05,694 --> 00:15:06,927
then running community meetings

362
00:15:06,962 --> 00:15:08,996
will be all they will ever let you do.

363
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,467
Okay.

364
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:32,325
LAPD. Anyone in here?

365
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,010
What were they smoking?

366
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,721
Uh, it smells like burned
donuts from a plastic oven.

367
00:16:07,756 --> 00:16:09,392
That's definitely meth.

368
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:11,533
And the pipe's still warm.

369
00:16:11,783 --> 00:16:12,917
Keep your eyes open.

370
00:16:12,966 --> 00:16:14,391
Mm-hmm.

371
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:20,734
Clear.

372
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:27,174
Clear.

373
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:29,093
Aaah!

374
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:38,052
Are you okay?

375
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:40,266
Behind you!

376
00:16:56,805 --> 00:16:58,238
- Hook him up.
- Yeah.

377
00:17:02,143 --> 00:17:03,719
Thank you.

378
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:05,485
He got me good.

379
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:07,915
Forget what I said earlier.

380
00:17:08,065 --> 00:17:10,635
Community meetings are
clearly all you're good for.

381
00:17:13,414 --> 00:17:14,812
Trust me, there's gonna be

382
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:16,749
many times your child's first year

383
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:18,398
where you're gonna want
to rush to the Internet

384
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:19,699
to check out their symptoms.

385
00:17:19,862 --> 00:17:21,635
Resist that urge.

386
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:26,140
- Yes?
- Um...

387
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,164
If the dad was doing drugs

388
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,005
when we... made my baby...

389
00:17:30,054 --> 00:17:33,413
There's no evidence that a father's
addiction affects the baby.

390
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:35,148
Okay. Thank you.

391
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:36,741
You're welcome.

392
00:17:37,718 --> 00:17:40,935
Okay. Now it's time to
introduce Officer Nolan.

393
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,500
John?

394
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:43,557
Yes.

395
00:17:43,591 --> 00:17:44,858
Officer Nolan is gonna show you

396
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:47,394
how to properly install
an infant's car seat.

397
00:17:47,428 --> 00:17:48,758
- Yes, I will.
- Yeah.

398
00:17:48,807 --> 00:17:49,859
You can't... You can't do that?

399
00:17:49,908 --> 00:17:51,598
No. I mean, pregnant mothers
feel more comfortable

400
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:52,866
when it comes from a police officer.

401
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,220
- Really?
- I mean, don't get me started.

402
00:17:54,268 --> 00:17:55,502
Nine years to become a doctor

403
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:56,696
and they trust a handsome cop more?

404
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:59,435
Well, to be fair,
a handsome cop in a super-cool uniform.

405
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:01,244
Hi, guys.

406
00:18:01,344 --> 00:18:05,275
I'm, uh, Officer Nolan, and, um, uh,

407
00:18:05,324 --> 00:18:07,102
car seats are the safest way

408
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:09,944
to transport your
soon-to-be bundles of joy,

409
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:11,618
and... it's the law.

410
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:13,086
So, uh...

411
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:15,755
installation is super-simple.

412
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:16,835
We're gonna start with the base.

413
00:18:16,884 --> 00:18:19,150
Guys, they make this
stuff just idiot-proof.

414
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,855
It's backwards.

415
00:18:20,904 --> 00:18:23,330
And it's... it's... it's
...this is forwards,

416
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:25,459
which is, of course... is wrong,
'cause you want it backwards.

417
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:26,693
The baby has to face the...

418
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:28,011
Again, guys, idiot-proof.

419
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,426
So, simply take these security straps

420
00:18:32,475 --> 00:18:34,194
and use the...

421
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:36,526
I think the
word that you're looking for

422
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,639
- is "latch."
- "Latch." Yes.

423
00:18:37,688 --> 00:18:39,324
I'm so sorry. I have to take this call.

424
00:18:39,373 --> 00:18:41,147
- It can't wait?
- It...

425
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:42,694
It really can't.

426
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:44,263
I'm... I'm... One...

427
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,061
Yes? Hey. How's it going?

428
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:47,415
- Um...
- No, no, I'm whispering

429
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:49,103
because I-I'm right in
the middle of a thing.

430
00:18:49,284 --> 00:18:51,751
Right, no, no, you can just tell me.

431
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:53,226
- Get up.
- You can't be here.

432
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:54,628
- Get... Get up.
- No, you can't be here.

433
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,927
- Get up.
- The judge said.

434
00:18:55,976 --> 00:18:57,396
- She's my kid, too.
- Hey, let her go.

435
00:18:57,444 --> 00:18:58,800
Back off! This is between us!

436
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:07,060
Hold it. Get over. Give me your hands.

437
00:19:07,168 --> 00:19:08,667
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Thank you.

438
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:13,947
You're gonna need stitches.

439
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:20,987
Thanks.

440
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:27,333
Something on your mind?

441
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:28,762
No, ma'am.

442
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:30,512
Yeah, that's what I thought.

443
00:19:31,323 --> 00:19:32,463
You're wrong about me.

444
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:34,354
Uh, no, I'm not.

445
00:19:34,403 --> 00:19:36,923
I can do so much more than
just community meetings.

446
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:39,669
You're right. You're probably
really good at paperwork.

447
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:42,245
- But you can't fight.
- I can fight.

448
00:19:42,442 --> 00:19:45,679
I've gone toe-to-toe with
plenty of suspects and won.

449
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:47,647
- Not that one.
- He's huge!

450
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,577
And yet, I took him and his buddy.

451
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:56,340
You want to hit me right
now, don't you?

452
00:19:56,723 --> 00:19:59,361
Yeah, I see it in your eyes.

453
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,296
Someone a little more your size.

454
00:20:03,563 --> 00:20:05,000
Well, come on.

455
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:06,688
What?

456
00:20:06,767 --> 00:20:08,321
Hit me, Not Nolan.

457
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:10,239
That is an order.

458
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,592
- Hey...
- Do it for real!

459
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:17,791
Come for me like that
tweaker came for you!

460
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,160
Now!

461
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,100
Aah!

462
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:27,821
Stay down,
and get used to that position.

463
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,301
Because in case you didn't know,

464
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,692
you are not a 6'2", 180-pound man.

465
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:34,265
Now, Tim might be a good T.O.,

466
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:36,833
but he can't teach you
how to fight like a girl.

467
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,874
We get a higher show of
force, especially from men.

468
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:41,023
So, guess what, sweetheart?

469
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:43,376
You are always going to be tested,

470
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:47,166
and when you are alone
against a desperate suspect,

471
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:48,843
and you are between them and freedom,

472
00:20:48,892 --> 00:20:50,846
your thoughts can never be,

473
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:53,213
"Oh, my, he's bigger than me."

474
00:21:05,074 --> 00:21:06,625
Look here, Not Nolan,

475
00:21:06,794 --> 00:21:08,868
if you're going to
survive these streets

476
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,451
as a 5'6" woman...

477
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,023
and one of color, no less...

478
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:16,081
you better learn what these
boys don't know to teach.

479
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,614
You ever think about
having another kid?

480
00:21:27,711 --> 00:21:29,459
I did, for the first
three of four years

481
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:30,817
after Oliver was born.

482
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,266
Then what happened?

483
00:21:32,407 --> 00:21:35,121
Then I spent too much
time in emergency rooms.

484
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:36,750
I don't have to tell you...

485
00:21:36,808 --> 00:21:39,409
there's...
there's so much tragedy out there.

486
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,066
I just...
I can't bring another life into it.

487
00:21:44,124 --> 00:21:45,601
Jess.

488
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,341
- Hey.
- Hey.

489
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,668
I-I-I couldn't get in touch with you,

490
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:50,103
so I called Grey,
and he said you were he...

491
00:21:50,151 --> 00:21:51,738
Oh, my God. What happened?

492
00:21:51,772 --> 00:21:53,357
Just a knife fight.
No big deal. Are you okay?

493
00:21:53,406 --> 00:21:54,808
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

494
00:21:54,842 --> 00:21:56,743
- It's nice seeing you again.
- Yes, yes, you, as well.

495
00:21:56,859 --> 00:21:58,278
Thank you.

496
00:21:58,401 --> 00:21:59,752
Uh...

497
00:22:00,523 --> 00:22:01,948
I'm sorry it took so long.

498
00:22:02,043 --> 00:22:03,754
I just, uh...

499
00:22:04,226 --> 00:22:07,287
I needed to have some time...
to process.

500
00:22:07,402 --> 00:22:09,022
No, okay. No, I get it, I see.

501
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:10,437
Um...

502
00:22:10,522 --> 00:22:11,758
so, you're pregnant.

503
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:15,803
No, I'm not.

504
00:22:16,364 --> 00:22:17,781
Okay.

505
00:22:17,998 --> 00:22:19,597
O-Okay, yeah, that's great, too...

506
00:22:19,646 --> 00:22:21,339
But I want to be.

507
00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:26,679
I'm sorry,

508
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,271
you're gonna have to help me out,
here a little bit, Jessica.

509
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,590
I'm... I'm a little confused.

510
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:31,510
Yes, well, I was, too, at first.

511
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,679
And when I took the pregnancy test

512
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,728
and it came back
negative, I was just...

513
00:22:34,762 --> 00:22:36,593
I was so disappointed.

514
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,934
And I-I-I couldn't shake it.

515
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,930
No, I... Okay. Um...

516
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:43,643
- It's just a little surprising.
- I know.

517
00:22:43,692 --> 00:22:45,672
I was... I was surprised, too.

518
00:22:45,707 --> 00:22:46,854
Look, I...

519
00:22:46,978 --> 00:22:49,131
I never wanted to be a mom before.

520
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:51,779
But being with you...

521
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,760
it... it changed me.

522
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,619
You see the good in people.

523
00:23:00,688 --> 00:23:04,191
You do the right thing,
even when it costs you.

524
00:23:06,361 --> 00:23:08,497
I miss that part of myself.

525
00:23:12,136 --> 00:23:14,575
Are... Are you...

526
00:23:14,624 --> 00:23:16,497
against having another kid?

527
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,506
No. No. No, I ju... Um...

528
00:23:21,176 --> 00:23:22,675
You're just throwing
a lot at me right now.

529
00:23:22,723 --> 00:23:24,878
- I know, I know.
- And I'm not quite sure what to say.

530
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:26,747
Okay, then don't say anything.

531
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,049
- Okay? At least not yet.
- Right.

532
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,717
I've had the whole morning
to think about this,

533
00:23:30,752 --> 00:23:33,514
and... now it's your turn.

534
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:35,162
We'll talk later.

535
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:36,923
Right. Good idea.

536
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,620
- Okay.
- Okay.

537
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,293
I am ahead of schedule.

538
00:23:51,422 --> 00:23:53,146
I'm never ahead of schedule.

539
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:55,309
- You're good.
- Yes, I am.

540
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,611
You know, with my businesses
growing like crazy,

541
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,980
I actually think I need to hire
a security chief here in L.A.

542
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:01,121
I already have a job, Mingus.

543
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,424
But does it pay you a
quarter mill a year?

544
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:04,598
Not at the present, no.

545
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:06,355
I haven't even gotten to the perks yet.

546
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:09,956
Hey. Hey, hey.

547
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:13,493
Police! Move and you're dead.

548
00:24:13,528 --> 00:24:15,703
What the hell are you doing?

549
00:24:15,814 --> 00:24:17,426
This is my cousin, Lev.

550
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:19,472
I asked him to meet us here.

551
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,869
- You okay?
- Yeah.

552
00:24:20,962 --> 00:24:23,294
- Let's go.
- Yeah. What is her problem?

553
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:24,908
Only two more nuisance complaints.

554
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,512
We can knock them out once
we get back on the street.

555
00:24:27,887 --> 00:24:29,254
You were right.

556
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,423
I should've followed your playbook
at the community meeting.

557
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,919
That was my bad.

558
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:35,549
So, uh, you got a challenge
coin from the governor.

559
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:37,038
- What's he like?
- You know what, Not Nolan,

560
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:38,653
I don't really do chit-chat.

561
00:24:39,617 --> 00:24:41,351
Uh, okay. Uh, look.

562
00:24:41,651 --> 00:24:43,082
Um...

563
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:46,798
I want to learn how to do
the job the way you do it.

564
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,096
Be like you.

565
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,131
No you don't.

566
00:24:51,229 --> 00:24:52,456
Are you kidding?

567
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,217
Y-You're a decorated detective

568
00:24:54,266 --> 00:24:56,436
with a storied undercover career,

569
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:58,028
not to mention the governor personally

570
00:24:58,077 --> 00:24:59,372
gave you one of his challenge coins.

571
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:00,540
I mean, that's huge.

572
00:25:00,575 --> 00:25:03,431
What's huge is the cost of
having a career like mine.

573
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,113
- What do you mean?
- Hopefully you never find out.

574
00:25:06,147 --> 00:25:08,285
Because none of the commendations
or the promotions

575
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:09,995
or even the challenge coins

576
00:25:10,084 --> 00:25:12,497
will ever make up for what I've lost.

577
00:25:12,673 --> 00:25:14,074
So don't be me.

578
00:25:14,194 --> 00:25:16,028
<i>I</i> don't even want to be me.

579
00:25:21,972 --> 00:25:23,973
Are you sure you're
okay to keep working?

580
00:25:26,142 --> 00:25:27,557
Officer Nolan.

581
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:30,433
What? Um... yes, sir. What did you say?

582
00:25:30,505 --> 00:25:32,268
Your arm... you want to
take the rest of the day?

583
00:25:32,317 --> 00:25:33,907
Oh, no. I'm... I'm... No, I'm fine.

584
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:35,358
Thank you, I'm good.

585
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:36,965
Alright.

586
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:38,681
Um, sir...

587
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,915
how long had you been a cop
when your daughter was born?

588
00:25:41,996 --> 00:25:43,583
- Two years.
- What was that like,

589
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:46,292
having a baby at home
and being on patrol?

590
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:51,157
Long days at work, late nights at home.

591
00:25:51,312 --> 00:25:53,092
Trying to master two
jobs at the same time.

592
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:54,196
It was hell.

593
00:25:54,245 --> 00:25:57,564
Only good sleep I got was in the
back of my shop during lunch.

594
00:25:57,753 --> 00:26:00,286
Yeah.

595
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,784
Yeah, but she was worth it.

596
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,666
Yeah, kids always are.

597
00:26:04,347 --> 00:26:05,981
Why are you asking?

598
00:26:06,203 --> 00:26:08,478
- No reason, sir.
- Mm-hmm. How's Jessica?

599
00:26:08,674 --> 00:26:10,068
She's great, sir.

600
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,254
- Give her my best.
- I will.

601
00:26:12,416 --> 00:26:14,843
Hey. Hey.

602
00:26:15,235 --> 00:26:16,780
- I need your help.
- What's wrong?

603
00:26:16,884 --> 00:26:18,418
I'm... I'm looking
for Officer Bradford.

604
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,053
He's out on patrol, son.
What's going on?

605
00:26:20,165 --> 00:26:22,634
It's my mom. She's missing.

606
00:26:24,091 --> 00:26:25,863
My mom went to borrow her cousin's car,

607
00:26:25,912 --> 00:26:27,853
so we could get out of town,
but she never came back.

608
00:26:27,902 --> 00:26:29,302
- When was this?
- Right after you all left.

609
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,259
Wait, that was hours ago.

610
00:26:30,308 --> 00:26:32,076
- Have you spoken with your cousin?
- Yeah.

611
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:33,600
He said my mom never showed.

612
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:34,935
I-I tried calling, texting.

613
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,417
I'm telling you guys,
something happened.

614
00:26:36,466 --> 00:26:37,886
We believe you, but now it's time

615
00:26:37,935 --> 00:26:39,118
for you to be straight with us.

616
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,848
Okay. Does this have anything
to do with the people

617
00:26:40,896 --> 00:26:42,453
who firebombed her car?

618
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:44,813
AJ, I know you're scared. I get it.

619
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:46,262
But you're not betraying
your mom's trust

620
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,730
by telling us what's going on.

621
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:49,499
Let us help her.

622
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:52,471
A few weeks back,

623
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,080
one of my mom's ex-boyfriends
started hounding her about being

624
00:26:55,129 --> 00:26:57,438
a getaway driver in some
heist he was putting together.

625
00:26:57,487 --> 00:26:59,054
- She agree to do it?
- Hell no.

626
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:01,148
My mom isn't about that life anymore.

627
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:03,041
She swore never to risk going back

628
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,564
to prison and not being there for me.

629
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,464
Okay, so she said no.
What'd the ex-boyfriend say?

630
00:27:06,513 --> 00:27:08,121
He said he was gonna kill
me if she didn't do it.

631
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:09,603
That's why she pulled you off the team,

632
00:27:09,637 --> 00:27:11,037
why she wanted to get
you out of the city...

633
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:12,459
to protect you.

634
00:27:12,707 --> 00:27:14,148
What's the ex-boyfriend's name?

635
00:27:14,275 --> 00:27:15,881
- Ian Shaunesy.
- So if he grabbed her,

636
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,437
it was to force her into
pulling the robbery.

637
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,664
Which means it's happening soon.

638
00:27:18,713 --> 00:27:20,137
AJ, do you know what the target is?

639
00:27:20,186 --> 00:27:22,082
No, all I know is that
it's happening downtown.

640
00:27:22,116 --> 00:27:23,583
Alright. You guys get down there.

641
00:27:23,632 --> 00:27:24,865
I'll get detectives on this.

642
00:27:24,997 --> 00:27:27,417
Put a BOLO out on the
mom and the ex-boyfriend.

643
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,169
It's gonna be okay. Alright?

644
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:36,636
Outside of actually spotting
AJ's mother or her ex-boyfriend,

645
00:27:36,685 --> 00:27:38,053
what exactly are we looking for?

646
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:39,316
Robbery targets.

647
00:27:39,365 --> 00:27:40,834
There are a dozen banks
and payday lenders

648
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,339
between here and Flower.

649
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:44,398
So, how do we whittle it down?

650
00:27:44,506 --> 00:27:46,173
Look for anything odd
or out of the ordinary.

651
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,470
Well, this is downtown L.A.
That describes everything.

652
00:28:06,598 --> 00:28:09,336
<i>- What's up? What's going on?</i>
- Why are you patrolling downtown?

653
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,197
How do you know where we are?

654
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:12,885
I just saw you drive by.

655
00:28:13,854 --> 00:28:16,841
We, uh, got intel on a
possible heist in the area.

656
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:19,577
- What's the target?
<i>- Unknown.</i>

657
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:22,342
I'm on 5th and Hill.

658
00:28:22,438 --> 00:28:24,086
You just passed me,
working a security detail

659
00:28:24,144 --> 00:28:25,344
on what could be a potential target.

660
00:28:25,392 --> 00:28:26,327
Gotta be honest with you,

661
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:27,405
I wouldn't hate having an escort.

662
00:28:28,496 --> 00:28:29,964
Excuse me. We need to leave now.

663
00:28:30,013 --> 00:28:31,379
I am in the middle of a conversation.

664
00:28:31,428 --> 00:28:32,652
No, you're at the end of it.

665
00:28:32,687 --> 00:28:33,887
Say goodbye to the pretty lady.

666
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:35,155
- Hey, what...
- Come on.

667
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:36,442
Are you out of your mind?

668
00:28:38,693 --> 00:28:40,534
Go, go, go, go, go!

669
00:28:42,292 --> 00:28:43,603
Police!

670
00:28:58,669 --> 00:28:59,802
Give up the damn case.

671
00:28:59,837 --> 00:29:01,033
- What?
- You're insured.

672
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:02,705
Give up the damn case,
or they'll kill us.

673
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,462
No, your job is to
protect my merchandise.

674
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:05,636
My job is to keep you alive,

675
00:29:05,685 --> 00:29:06,845
and I'm nine bullets from failing.

676
00:29:06,893 --> 00:29:08,206
Give up the case!

677
00:29:09,522 --> 00:29:11,290
Wait! Hold fire!

678
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,383
Let's go, let's go.

679
00:29:15,558 --> 00:29:17,194
Cover me.

680
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,885
Open the door.

681
00:29:21,949 --> 00:29:23,760
Open the door! Right now.

682
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:25,694
- Open it.
- <i>Let's go!</i>

683
00:29:32,753 --> 00:29:34,015
Drop the guns!

684
00:29:34,177 --> 00:29:35,251
Do it now!

685
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,773
Drop your guns right now!

686
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:38,503
Let's go, back up.
Back away from the car.

687
00:29:38,581 --> 00:29:39,988
Get down on your knees.

688
00:29:40,057 --> 00:29:42,745
Down on your knees! Spread your arms.

689
00:29:42,878 --> 00:29:44,977
- You okay?
- I am now.

690
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:48,760
Step out of the car,
get your hands where I can see them.

691
00:29:50,212 --> 00:29:51,745
<i>Let's go.</i>

692
00:29:51,995 --> 00:29:54,690
They kidnapped me. Forced me into this.

693
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:56,634
I know. AJ told us everything.

694
00:29:56,683 --> 00:29:57,844
But I got to place you under arrest,

695
00:29:57,893 --> 00:29:59,253
until we work something
out with the D.A.

696
00:29:59,301 --> 00:30:00,773
Put your hands up there.

697
00:30:03,706 --> 00:30:05,636
- Is it safe?
- All clear.

698
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,286
Hey, hey, hey. No, no.
That's evidence now.

699
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:12,939
You'll have to come collect
it from the station,

700
00:30:12,987 --> 00:30:14,130
after we process it.

701
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:16,559
- Can you do something?
- Nope.

702
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,066
And this marks the last stop

703
00:30:19,115 --> 00:30:21,012
on our community policing tour.

704
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,204
Bradford and West are facing
off against heist crews,

705
00:30:23,253 --> 00:30:24,618
and we are here to...?

706
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:28,080
To talk to a neighbor
about feeding squirrels.

707
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:31,378
Sorry.

708
00:30:31,427 --> 00:30:34,009
Make it up to me by getting
a start on that paperwork.

709
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:45,748
What?

710
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:48,120
Sir, your neighbors are complaining

711
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:50,236
that you are feeding squirrels.

712
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:51,427
So what?

713
00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:54,836
Los Angeles Municipal Code 53.06.5,

714
00:30:54,885 --> 00:30:57,378
which says it is illegal
to feed wild animals.

715
00:30:57,427 --> 00:31:00,139
Punishable by a fine of up to $1,000,

716
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:02,774
and/or six months' imprisonment.

717
00:31:03,316 --> 00:31:04,913
They're squirrels.

718
00:31:05,062 --> 00:31:06,574
Doesn't matter.

719
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:09,584
What happened to your hand?

720
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:12,261
It was a lawn mower. Are we done?

721
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,378
Yes, sir. Have a good one.

722
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,706
Hey, uh, so, should I mark that down

723
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:21,222
as being given a verbal warning?

724
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:23,273
No, run a background check.

725
00:31:30,295 --> 00:31:31,935
You want to give me a hint
at what we're doing here?

726
00:31:31,983 --> 00:31:33,078
The guy was missing two fingers.

727
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:35,261
Damage like that was caused
by an explosive device.

728
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,908
Maybe he was in the military.

729
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:38,394
He said it was a lawn mower.

730
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,384
Ernie Bosk.

731
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,568
Records check are negative

732
00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:45,878
on any military or
law-enforcement service.

733
00:31:45,927 --> 00:31:47,894
- You studied bombings in the Academy?
- Mm.

734
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:50,325
Did they cover the
UCLA bombings in 2009?

735
00:31:50,374 --> 00:31:53,109
Yeah, of course.
They recovered an unexploded pipe bomb.

736
00:31:53,158 --> 00:31:55,312
With a red hair inside of it.

737
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:57,057
You think that's him.

738
00:31:57,557 --> 00:31:59,525
Well, we'll need a DNA
sample to be sure, but...

739
00:31:59,574 --> 00:32:01,350
- Whoa, what are you doing?
- Getting a warrant.

740
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:03,811
We don't need one if we can get
a sample from his trash cans.

741
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:06,054
And I can search that
without a warrant.

742
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:08,425
Okay.

743
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,386
What happens if you get caught?

744
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:13,115
You know, if you're right,
this guy makes bombs.

745
00:32:13,187 --> 00:32:15,376
You really want him
throwing one your way?

746
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:16,850
Not really.

747
00:32:16,947 --> 00:32:18,981
Well, then you're gonna need
someone to distract him.

748
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:28,723
- Hi. How are you?
- What do you want?

749
00:32:28,801 --> 00:32:30,435
Uh, to talk to you about the importance

750
00:32:30,484 --> 00:32:31,918
of drought-resistant vegetation.

751
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:33,153
I know it's a boring topic,

752
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:34,448
but if you just give me three minutes,

753
00:32:34,497 --> 00:32:36,847
I guarantee that I will
make it worth your while.

754
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:40,865
Uh, each year,
we waste millions of gallons of water

755
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:42,779
on plants and flowers

756
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:44,200
<i>that are non-conducive</i>

757
00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:45,529
<i>to Southern California's climate...</i>

758
00:32:45,578 --> 00:32:47,018
I'm gonna stop you right there.

759
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:48,223
I don't care.

760
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:50,496
Uh, uh, sir, please... Um,

761
00:32:50,711 --> 00:32:52,277
could, could I have a glass of water?

762
00:32:52,326 --> 00:32:53,819
I... I've been out all morning.

763
00:32:53,933 --> 00:32:56,101
Maybe you should be
more drought-resistant.

764
00:32:56,362 --> 00:32:58,147
Yes, sir.

765
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:00,787
The water?

766
00:33:02,842 --> 00:33:04,341
Fine.

767
00:33:15,653 --> 00:33:18,108
Sir? The water?

768
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:20,372
You a cop, too?

769
00:33:20,528 --> 00:33:21,661
Uh, yeah.

770
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,902
That's my partner outside
conducting a lawful search,

771
00:33:23,951 --> 00:33:24,981
so you just need to relax.

772
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,177
Harper, he's running!

773
00:33:26,226 --> 00:33:27,380
- Hey.
- 7-Adam-15,

774
00:33:27,414 --> 00:33:29,860
start me up another unit, 5611, Code 3.

775
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,610
Turn around.

776
00:33:31,752 --> 00:33:33,210
Hands where I can see them.

777
00:33:35,042 --> 00:33:36,157
What the hell was that?

778
00:33:36,206 --> 00:33:37,689
Burglar alarm system.

779
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:40,188
I built it myself.

780
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,544
It's my own private DMZ.

781
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:44,933
There are pressure plates
all throughout the floor.

782
00:33:45,318 --> 00:33:46,903
They're rigged to IEDs.

783
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,990
You take one wrong step,

784
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,501
they'll be cleaning you off
the ceiling with a squeegee.

785
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:54,006
- Chen!
- No.

786
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:56,383
Harper, don't come inside the house.

787
00:33:56,432 --> 00:33:58,017
It's booby-trapped.

788
00:33:58,711 --> 00:34:01,335
No, stay! Don't come in. It's rigged.

789
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:02,540
Where's Bosk?

790
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:04,179
In the back room.

791
00:34:04,766 --> 00:34:06,999
<i>He's arming a bomb, a big-ass bomb.</i>

792
00:34:07,048 --> 00:34:08,181
<i>You got to get clear of the house,</i>

793
00:34:08,216 --> 00:34:09,349
radio the bomb squad,

794
00:34:09,384 --> 00:34:10,718
and clear the neighborhood.

795
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:21,328
Mr. Bosk, you don't need to do this.

796
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:22,677
Why not?

797
00:34:22,897 --> 00:34:24,252
I'm caught.

798
00:34:24,332 --> 00:34:26,133
May as well go out with a bang.

799
00:34:27,902 --> 00:34:30,094
How long ago did you rig the house?

800
00:34:30,371 --> 00:34:32,745
Months? Years?

801
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:33,974
Almost a decade.

802
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,126
I've been waiting that long for cops,

803
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,111
to show up on my doorstep.

804
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:40,377
A decade.

805
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:42,753
Avoiding pressure plates.

806
00:35:41,066 --> 00:35:42,976
Let go of the wire slowly.

807
00:35:43,581 --> 00:35:45,245
Turn around. Hands behind your back.

808
00:35:45,365 --> 00:35:46,566
Do it now!

809
00:35:46,961 --> 00:35:49,249
Don't you want me to disarm
the bombs before you cuff me?

810
00:35:49,298 --> 00:35:50,412
Nope.

811
00:35:50,461 --> 00:35:52,419
My guess is you'd enter a code

812
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:54,054
that would set it all off.

813
00:35:54,088 --> 00:35:55,307
So we're going out the window.

814
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:05,663
Hey.

815
00:36:05,758 --> 00:36:07,300
Uh, house is still booby-trapped,

816
00:36:07,335 --> 00:36:09,215
but he didn't finish rigging
the fertilizer bomb, so...

817
00:36:09,263 --> 00:36:10,489
- Nice work.
- You got him?

818
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:12,279
- Uh-huh. Yeah.
- Alright.

819
00:36:12,418 --> 00:36:14,133
- You gonna puke?
- No.

820
00:36:14,182 --> 00:36:15,610
No. No.

821
00:36:15,694 --> 00:36:17,149
Maybe.

822
00:36:24,284 --> 00:36:25,387
How you doing?

823
00:36:25,436 --> 00:36:28,005
Well, my hands stopped
shaking about 15 minutes ago.

824
00:36:28,589 --> 00:36:30,049
That's a good sign, right?

825
00:36:30,098 --> 00:36:31,432
Yep.

826
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:34,355
Oh, hey, um, I just wanted to say...

827
00:36:35,289 --> 00:36:37,014
- thanks.
- You're welcome.

828
00:36:37,122 --> 00:36:39,587
Sorry if I was such a... you know.

829
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,506
- Douche?
- Yeah.

830
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:44,595
Uh, but listen,
please come be my head of security.

831
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:45,900
I'll give you a 100K bonus.

832
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:47,798
No. It's not about the money.

833
00:36:48,027 --> 00:36:50,267
All today did was remind me
how much I love being a cop.

834
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:53,324
All these officers,

835
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:55,406
including the two that
saved our bacon...

836
00:36:56,016 --> 00:36:57,775
they're my family.

837
00:36:58,087 --> 00:36:59,777
And I guess - I'm not ready to say bye.

838
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:05,329
However, I will take a
"save your life bonus"

839
00:37:05,377 --> 00:37:06,784
if you're still feeling generous.

840
00:37:16,238 --> 00:37:17,700
Hey.

841
00:37:17,929 --> 00:37:19,730
Nice working with you today.

842
00:37:19,826 --> 00:37:20,960
Yeah, you, too.

843
00:37:21,028 --> 00:37:22,317
Look...

844
00:37:22,483 --> 00:37:25,651
I was wrong to discourage you today.

845
00:37:25,733 --> 00:37:27,660
Go as far as you want in this job.

846
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,229
You say you want to be a cop like
me, screw that.

847
00:37:30,278 --> 00:37:31,882
Be <i>better</i> than me.

848
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:34,164
You got what it takes, Not Nolan.

849
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:35,580
I heard you call me
Chen back at the house.

850
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:37,014
I know you know my name.

851
00:37:38,817 --> 00:37:41,104
Um... would it be alright

852
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:42,629
if I asked you for advice,

853
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,036
from time to time?

854
00:37:44,193 --> 00:37:45,427
Sure.

855
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:46,991
Just not too often.

856
00:37:47,419 --> 00:37:49,781
I don't want to mess up
the whole lone wolf persona

857
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:51,729
I got going on.

858
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:00,838
It's, um, presumptuous, I know,

859
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:04,185
but I was hoping - we'd
have cause to celebrate.

860
00:38:10,726 --> 00:38:12,627
But we don't, do we?

861
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:15,476
I'm sorry.

862
00:38:16,287 --> 00:38:17,337
And that's it?

863
00:38:17,385 --> 00:38:19,765
There's...
There's no room for discussion?

864
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,926
Jessica, um...

865
00:38:22,327 --> 00:38:24,375
I love being a father...

866
00:38:24,484 --> 00:38:27,197
And... I would love to be a mom.

867
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,906
And I want that for you. I do.

868
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:32,850
But for me,

869
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:35,828
I'm not ready to be a father again.

870
00:38:36,097 --> 00:38:37,828
Not just yet.

871
00:38:38,743 --> 00:38:40,144
Okay.

872
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:42,136
What does that mean?

873
00:38:43,748 --> 00:38:45,222
You're already through

874
00:38:45,271 --> 00:38:47,058
the steepest part of your career,

875
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:48,665
but me, I'm...

876
00:38:49,255 --> 00:38:51,941
I'm still just finding my footing.

877
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:57,519
And I gave up my first
path 20 years ago.

878
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,699
And I can't do that again.

879
00:39:02,147 --> 00:39:04,280
But if you can just...

880
00:39:04,757 --> 00:39:06,118
be patient with me,

881
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:07,364
we can come back to this

882
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:08,939
in a year, two years tops...

883
00:39:08,974 --> 00:39:11,342
Years? No.

884
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:13,590
Yeah, Nolan, um...

885
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:17,671
it doesn't exactly -
work like that for women.

886
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:19,537
I mean, I can't... I can't just...

887
00:39:19,689 --> 00:39:22,163
sit around and wait...

888
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,691
for the hopes that maybe
someday you'll be ready.

889
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:30,828
I would resent you.

890
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,279
And I would hate you.

891
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:38,902
I don't ever want that.

892
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,912
So, what does that mean?

893
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:46,556
I'm... I'm gonna go home.

894
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:51,298
And I'll come back tomorrow

895
00:39:52,237 --> 00:39:54,786
for my stuff when you're not here.

896
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:59,289
Jess...

897
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,232
- There you go.
- Thanks.

898
00:40:23,538 --> 00:40:24,726
You ready?

899
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:27,357
Hike!

900
00:40:29,144 --> 00:40:30,262
- Attaboy!
- Nice!

901
00:40:30,311 --> 00:40:32,137
- There you go!
- You know, AJ, back in high school,

902
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:33,982
I was ranked one of the top
quarterbacks in the state.

903
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,474
I could believe that.

904
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,728
The interceptions you threw me
were always perfect spirals.

905
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:40,796
So let's see - if you
still got the skills.

906
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:43,397
You and AJ versus me and the rook.

907
00:40:43,534 --> 00:40:45,468
- Let's go.
- Let's do this.

908
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:46,825
Show 'em what you got, baby.

909
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:48,454
I always do, Mama.

910
00:40:49,103 --> 00:40:51,006
Hey, uh, don't get your ankles
broke, old man.

911
00:40:51,055 --> 00:40:52,568
Kid, I am 26. Don't play me.

912
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,219
Ooh, and you about - to get
dusted by a 14-year-old.

913
00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:56,540
How sad is that?

914
00:40:56,589 --> 00:40:58,524
LAPD has great medical coverage, right?

915
00:40:58,573 --> 00:40:59,670
Yeah, yeah, very funny.

916
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,951
Real funny when you're gonna
be on the ground smashed.

917
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,076
Five-Mississippi.

918
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:04,762
Whoa! Old lady, huh?

919
00:41:04,811 --> 00:41:06,745
Okay. Make it three.

920
00:41:09,365 --> 00:41:11,144
- Hike!
- One, two, three.

921
00:41:11,193 --> 00:41:12,686
You didn't say "Mississippi"!
