00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,563
Hey,
what are you doing here?

8
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,273
Abigail had a buttload
of flyer miles,

9
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,775
so we, uh, flew out
to surprise you.

10
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:25,859
Oh, my God.

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,819
Abigail, it's so nice
to finally meet you.

12
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,112
It's great
to meet you, too.

13
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,783
The videos
didn't do it justice.

14
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,117
This place is a wreck.

15
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,994
I think it's awesome.

16
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,120
It's like
a faded beauty queen

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,664
that you're bringing
back to life.

18
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,457
Oh, wow. You are quickly
becoming my favorite.

19
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,125
Mine, too.

20
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,419
Uh, we have
some good news.

21
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,796
Exciting.
Lay it on me.

22
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,214
I'm pregnant.

23
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,259
Kidding.
I'm -- I'm kidding.

24
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:51,969
We're engaged.

25
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,973
Sorry about
the pregnant thing.

26
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,349
I-I thought
it would soften the blow.

27
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,476
Abigail, uh, that is, um,
is beautiful.

28
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,811
That is a beautiful ri--

29
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:03,522
I hope you didn't, uh,
spend your tuition money.

30
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,941
I used the money that I was
saving to go to Europe,

31
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:07,484
because Abigail's the journey

32
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,236
I want to spend
the rest of my life on.

33
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,988
Aww.
Aww.

34
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,364
That's so --
That is --

35
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,991
That's so...

36
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,617
Does your mom know?

37
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,494
She thought it would be best
if I told you in person.

38
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,912
Uh, yeah.

39
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,163
She also recommended
that we quickly follow the news

40
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,873
with some electrolytes.

41
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,252
That is...hilarious
and entirely unnecessary.

42
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,878
Have you set a date?

43
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,715
Not yet, but we're, uh,
we're talking about June.

44
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,675
Isn't it exciting?

45
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,261
It's so exciting.

46
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,221
Crap!

47
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:45,230
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
whoa, oh, oh ♪

48
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,068

49
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,903
I feel like Goldilocks,

50
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,947
except instead of "too hot"
or "too cold,"

51
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,868
every guy I date is either,
you know, "too frat-bro,"

52
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,786
or "too stick me
with the check

53
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,872
because you are never going
to finish that screenplay

54
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,582
working on your abs."

55
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,792
Let's face it,
I am never going
to find someone.

56
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,918
Yeah,
not if you keep looking

57
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,378
in hipster clubs
and hot yoga studios.

58
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,422
Ah.
What you need
is a grown man.

59
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,798
I would just settle for
a decent pickup line.

60
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,675
Oh, thank God.

61
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,218
Okay. Wow.
We gotta go.

62
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,470
Thank you.

63
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,597
Mom.

64
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,599
What are you doing here?

65
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,685
Your father and I
are getting divorced.

66
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,356
Hi, Mrs. Chen.
I'm so sorry.

67
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,107
Oh, Jackson, sweetheart,
thank you.

68
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,859
What happened?

69
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,986
I don't want
to talk about it.

70
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,196
Okay, is this like the time

71
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,405
that you didn't
talk to Dad for a week

72
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,908
because he forgot
your birthday?

73
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:40,911
I said I don't want
to talk about it.

74
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,455
Oh. I'm sure my back
will be fine.

75
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,374
I assume
you have extra bedding.

76
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,584
Oh. Mom, you're not
sleeping on the couch.

77
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,544
I'll get you a hotel.

78
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,879
Nonsense.

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,297
No, I'll take the couch.

80
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,799
Mrs. Chen,
you can take my room.

81
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,134
Such a sweet boy.

82
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,344
Would you mind putting this
in my room?

83
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,428
I have to get ready
for work.

84
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,890
Is that really
what you're wearing?

85
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,942
Nice groupings.

86
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:14,277
Thanks.

87
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,405
So, I need yesterday's
after-action reports.

88
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:18,407
I will have them for you
at the end of shift.

89
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,741
You mean
when today's are due?

90
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,494
I know you're used to being
out on the edge, all alone,

91
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,538
but paperwork's
part of the gig here.

92
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,331
Copy that.
I will get caught up quick.

93
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,166
Officer Nolan's
not the only one

94
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,459
being evaluated,
Detective.

95
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,961
I know you got
the golden ticket,

96
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:31,795
but you got to do the work.

97
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,880
Understand?

98
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,299
Yes, sir.

99
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,013
Henry got engaged.

100
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,223
Yeah,
he just turned 20.

101
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,641
I know.
It's too young.

102
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,851
Didn't you get married
around then?

103
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,185
That's not the point.

104
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,979
So, I just talked
to my dad.

105
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:52,065
Apparently, he only brought home
a bagel for himself.

106
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,733
He did not bring one
for my mom.

107
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:54,776
That's why she left?

108
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,278
Bagel that broke
the camel's back.

109
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:57,487
Maybe it's for the best.

110
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,947
Oh, God, no.

111
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,491
Separately, they will make
my life twice as miserable.

112
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,909
I have to get them
back together.

113
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,035
Just...
Morning.

114
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,498
She is definitely
warming up to me.

115
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,959
So, Officer West,

116
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,836
can you tell us
what a "friendly" is?
Yes, sir.

117
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,589
A "friendly" is another term
for a Confidential Informant.
Correct.

118
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:16,923
And Confidential Informants

119
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,467
can be an incredibly
useful tool.

120
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,635
They're definitely tools.

121
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,138
Are you saying you don't
use them, Officer Bradford?
No, sir.

122
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,848
Just saying that
they're lying liars who lie

123
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,266
and they need
to be dominated,

124
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,893
never allowed to think
they're in control.

125
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,394
Officer Lopez,
you agree?
No, sir.

126
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,520
C.I.s are most useful

127
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,522
when they think
they're part of the team.

128
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,191
You're both wrong.

129
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,567
Please, school us, Detective.

130
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,152
C.I.s are just people
trying to get by.

131
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,945
Some are psychopaths
who play ball

132
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,072
because it's
the best available option,

133
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,033
some are people
in over their heads

134
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,786
who cling to you desperately
as a way out of trouble.

135
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,747
Treating them all the same
is a mistake.

136
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,334
Well, it's time to put
these theories to the test.

137
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,753
Nolan, Chen, part of the second
phase of your training

138
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,087
is developing
your first C.I.

139
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,881
See, you've known
this day was coming,

140
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,383
so I'm confident that you have
a plan of action in place.

141
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,385
But be forewarned --

142
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,470
you will be evaluated on

143
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,597
the arrests
generated by your C. I.,

144
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,766
as well as
their long-term viability.

145
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,392
So, choose wisely.

146
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,644
Alright, that's it.

147
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,229
Be safe.

148
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,608
Sir, you have to let West
participate.

149
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,568
Do I?
You've read
my daily evals.

150
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,737
His work is as strong
as it's ever been,

151
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,239
and this is
an opportunity to prove

152
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,156
that he's ready
to move on.

153
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,575
It's a big swing,
Officer West.

154
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,285
Screw it up,

155
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,995
it's likely to be
the last nail.

156
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,413
You sure you want
to take that chance?

157
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,582
Yes, sir.

158
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,918
Alright. You're in.

159
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,211
Good?

160
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,963
Thank you, sir.

161
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,549
You are the greatest T. O.
in the history of T. O. s.

162
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,551
Here you go.
You got a choice
to make --

163
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:45,470
be conservative
or be bold.

164
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,638
Tim's gonna make sure

165
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,098
Lucy bags a work horse
for her first C.I.

166
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,224
Nothing flashy.

167
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,475
And Harper?

168
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,352
My guess is
she'll let Nolan drive it --

169
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,520
sink or swim on his own.

170
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,021
You think
we should go big.

171
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,565
It's the riskiest move,

172
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,358
but the one that will get you
into short sleeves quicker.

173
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,361
But a big fish takes time,

174
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,487
and if you fail
to recruit him,

175
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,905
you run the real risk
of hitting the week's end

176
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,990
without someone.

177
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,701
And Grey'll bounce me
for sure.

178
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,872
Screw it.

179
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,707
Let's go for it.
That's the spirit.

180
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,916
You got a candidate?
Yeah.

181
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,334
A guy the Feds use,

182
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,295
but you should hit an ATM
on the way over.

183
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,297
This guy's not cheap.

184
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,048
Hey, Nick. Heading home?

185
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,550
My bed awaits.

186
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,093
I just had
an armed robbery suspect

187
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,052
in the box all night.

188
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,512
I'm fried.
How're you?

189
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,681
I just found out
my son got engaged.

190
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:30,974
Whoa.

191
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,225
I-Isn't he, like, 12?

192
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,393
20.
Right.

193
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,270
You like the girl?
Abigail.

194
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,938
She seems very sweet.

195
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,523
Just met her for the first time
this morning.

196
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,983
Also 20.

197
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,319
You run her
through the system?

198
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,403
A background check?

199
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,779
No, it's against the rules,

200
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,156
and it's just...wrong.

201
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,366
If it were me,
I'd want to know.

202
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,242
See you tomorrow.

203
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,703
Well,
technically tonight.

204
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,996
-Right.
-Here you go.

205
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,205
Oh.

206
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,464
What are
we doing here, Boot?

207
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,883
As you're aware,
pawn shops are required by law

208
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,427
to notify law enforcement
if they believe someone

209
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,845
is trying to pawn off
stolen property.

210
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,180
I pulled city records.

211
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,015
This shop
has never called us.

212
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,725
Either the owner is a saint,
or --

213
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,186
Or he's dealing
with a lot of stolen goods.
Exactly.

214
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,897
Making them the perfect
candidate for my first C.I.

215
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,649
Don't get too cocky,
Officer Chen.

216
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,983
Recruiting a reliable C.I.
is hard work.

217
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:22,984
Yes, sir.

218
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,779
Sorry, my parents are...

219
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,072
Uh, never mind.

220
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,912
Morning.
Good morning.
What can I do for you?

221
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,288
We're doing interviews

222
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,248
for the detectives
in Robbery-Homicide.

223
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,793
Has anyone tried to pass off
stolen items recently?
No, absolutely not.

224
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,211
How do you know
they're not stolen
before you buy them?

225
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,338
'Cause I'm a very good judge
of people.

226
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,964
What's your impression
of me?

227
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,925
That you're
a very distrustful woman.

228
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,350
Detective Harrison,
it's Officer Chen.

229
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,394
Yeah, we're gonna need you
to send Code Enforcement

230
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,520
down to High-Life --

231
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,480
That's not necessary.
Hold on, Craig.

232
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,190
If you're above board,
there shouldn't be
a problem, right?

233
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:06,695
Okay.

234
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,321
There may be a few things

235
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,698
that are from
questionable sources.

236
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,408
Nice job.

237
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,159
Great, let's see it,

238
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,829
and don't give me any of that
low-end misdemeanor crap.

239
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,168
Woman brought this in
yesterday,

240
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,670
and it's not
the first designer bag

241
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,046
she's brought me.

242
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:25,839
Mm.
Retails for what?

243
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,590
Five grand?
Six.

244
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,261
What are you looking for?

245
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,930
These high-end bags
have serial numbers sewn in.

246
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,765
They're registered
to the original buyer.

247
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,600
Yeah.

248
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,060
Bingo.

249
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,649
Hey, there.

250
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,567
Bianca, right?

251
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,820
Do I know you?

252
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,405
No, I have this acquaintance
in narcotics.

253
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,948
He, uh --

254
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:52,991
Well, actually, I installed
a new kitchen island for him.

255
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,826
Anyway, I was telling him

256
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:57,537
I need a low-level drug mule
that I can flip into a C. I.,

257
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,830
and he mentioned you.

258
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,460
Bianca!

259
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,503
Why are you running?
We know where you live.

260
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,088
She's got drugs
in her bag.
Really?

261
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:07,964
Uh-huh.
Bianca, is that right?

262
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,220
Easy.

263
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,764
Okay. Easy. I got you.

264
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,057
Come on. Come on.

265
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,183
Come on.

266
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,934
Relax, okay?

267
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,108
Heroin?
Yep.

268
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,818
Enough to put Bianca
in prison

269
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,820
for the rest of
her child-bearing years.

270
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,572
Do you want to go
to prison, Bianca?

271
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,616
No.

272
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:37,035
Then you're gonna
have to flip on your boss,

273
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,703
and depending on
how that goes,

274
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,498
you're gonna become
an informant -- my informant --

275
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,958
pointing us to more drug dealers
and suppliers.

276
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,253
I can't do that.
They'll kill me.

277
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,130
And we'll protect you.

278
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,174
He can't promise you that.

279
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,801
You need to be clear
with a C.I.

280
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,302
You'll do your best
to treat them right,

281
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,970
look out for them,
but you're not God,

282
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,722
and you're not
with them 24/7.

283
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,557
Understood.

284
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,143
And thank you.

285
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,311
So, those are your choices,
Bianca.

286
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,188
You can go to jail
or you can help us.

287
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,106
What's it gonna be?

288
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,116
You're gonna get me killed.

289
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,450
Hey, if anything happens,

290
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,786
we'll be just
across the courtyard.

291
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,955
Your boss usually punctual?

292
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,206
For a drug dealer.

293
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:25,708
Look, don't be a hero.

294
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,668
Just give him the bag,

295
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:28,336
you take your fee,
you walk away,

296
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,629
just like you've done
hundreds of times.

297
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,089
All done.

298
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,715
Talk in a normal voice.

299
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,137
Tell the man
at the funeral home

300
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,013
that I want to be
turned into a tree.

301
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,392
Make sure they don't
put me in a box.

302
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,144
I get claustrophobic.

303
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,104
Bianca, I promise...

304
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,609
...if anything goes wrong,
we will be there.

305
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,739
Can I go to the bathroom
with this stuff?

306
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,241
Sure.

307
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,622
And don't listen.

308
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,759
Hey, girl.

309
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,929
I thought --

310
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,181
Yeah, don't do that.

311
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,767
He'll be here in a minute.

312
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,894
Let's get set.

313
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,190
Damn it.

314
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,692
So, I was thinking
we could start small,

315
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,902
see what type of intel
you have.

316
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,279
Hold your roll, Officer.

317
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,655
The only reason
I'm talking to you

318
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,324
is because you paid
my greens' fee.

319
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,951
Truth is, I work exclusively
with the Feds.

320
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,703
They pay way better
than the LAPD.

321
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,371
100 grand last year

322
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,582
for intel on
nine high-profile felonies.

323
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,542
Now,
you gonna match that?

324
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,461
While the LAPD can't beat
that kind of number,

325
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,463
your FBI handler
isn't gonna give you

326
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,673
the kind of personal attention
that I will.

327
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,384
He offering massages?

328
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,762
There's got to be
something or someone

329
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,472
that's bothering you.

330
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:06,434
My ex-wife is screwing
this Pakistani guy.

331
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,020
Owns a used car dealership
on Van Nuys --

332
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,980
definitely moving
stolen cars.

333
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,357
And why do you care?

334
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,567
My ex torched all
my Armani suits on the way out.

335
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,778
So, you take something
she cares about

336
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,863
away from her...

337
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:19,948
I'll play ball.

338
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,538
He's here.

339
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,676
He went into the room.

340
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,057
She's going in.

341
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,120
What's going on?

342
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,789
It's fine.

343
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,666
Let it play out.

344
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,397
See?

345
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,690
All good.

346
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,655
Arms up.

347
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,242
Hey, I don't get
to keep that?
Sorry.

348
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,119
Alright, well,
let's go get this guy.

349
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,206
Okay, just sit here,
relax.

350
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:54,751
The hard part's done.
Great job.

351
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,935
Freeze.

352
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,395
Police!
Hands up.

353
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,565
Drop the bag.

354
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,858
Interlace your fingers
behind your head.

355
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:19,984
Don't move.

356
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,036
Decent bust, rookie.

357
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,084
Bianca?

358
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,965
Hey.

359
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,552
Bianca?

360
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,265
Harper, I need Narcan
in the room right now.

361
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,982
Bianca. Hey.

362
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,526
Stay with me, alright?

363
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,364
Where'd she get the drugs?

364
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,824
Must have had a leftover
from the deal.

365
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,245
Easy, easy, easy.
I got you. I got you.
Control, 7-Adam-15 --

00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,289
We need an ambulance
at the Dollar Motel on Olympic.

Uh, these officers
want to speak with you.

374
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,685
Cool.

375
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,396
What's up?

376
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,314
We're here about
some stolen property.

377
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,858
Do you recognize
this bag?

378
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,820
Yeah, I've got one
just like it.

379
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,072
We believe this one is yours.
It was at a pawn shop.

380
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,866
We matched the serial number
to your credit card purchase.

381
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,367
Hilda!

382
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,660
Yes, Mrs?

383
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,203
You're fired.

384
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,621
What?
Please,
don't make a scene.

385
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,622
It'll just upset me.

386
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,790
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey.

387
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,168
What's going on?
What did you do?

388
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,419
Hilda's been robbing us.

389
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,337
I have not.

390
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,422
Who are you?

391
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,174
This is my daughter,
Olivia.

392
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,593
Step-daughter.
You were 9 when I was born.

393
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,469
Olivia, do you know anything
about a stolen handbag?

394
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,180
The description
the pawn shop owner gave us

395
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,723
fits you more than
your housekeeper.

396
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:17,935
Yeah.

397
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,062
Yeah, I took it.

398
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,106
But she has so many,
she didn't even notice.

399
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,233
You are such a brat.

400
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,318
You're such a parasite.

401
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,819
Don't talk to your mother
that way.

402
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,862
You are not my mother!

403
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:29,113
Okay, calm down.

404
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,615
Calm down.
Both of you, okay?

405
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,241
I want her arrested.

406
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,868
It's the only way
she'll learn.

407
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,621
Are you sure that's what
her father would want?

408
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,623
Her father wants
whatever I tell him.

409
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,417

410
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,711

Six stolen cars.

412
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,100
Grey's gonna be impressed,

413
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,685
but we still need to get Hickey
officially signed up.

414
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,646
On it.

415
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,688
<i>Yo.</i>

416
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,649
Mr. Hickey,
it's Officer West.

417
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,150
Your intel was spot-on.

418
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,944
We've impounded
six stolen vehicles

419
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,528
and arrested
Mr. Fawad Chandio.

420
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,655
<i>That's awesome.</i>

421
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,989
<i>Nicky's gonna cry</i>
<i>for a week.</i>

422
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,449
So, it means
you're on board?

423
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,493
<i>I'm a man of my word.</i>
Great.

424
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,245
We'll just need you
to come into the station

425
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,204
and fill out
some paperwork.
<i>Yeah, you got it.</i>

426
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,208
She'll be okay.

427
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,668
We're gonna
keep her overnight

428
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,294
and monitor her
for a concussion.

429
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,754
Thanks.

430
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,130
You know,
I still don't understand

431
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,799
how she overdosed
while in custody.

432
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,051
I left her alone
while we made the bust.

433
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,511
I just --
I feel terrible.

434
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,012
You two used to date.

435
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,305
What?
No -- What?

436
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,848
No.
Ye-- Well, yes, but --

437
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,141
I'm not judging.
You're very pretty.

438
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,185
Thank you.

439
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,563
Well, I'm not
uncomfortable at all,

440
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:46,440
and I think we should
probably go, right?

441
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,608
Nice meeting you.
You, too.

442
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,696
So, are you counting Bianca
as your first C. I.?

443
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,281
Shouldn't I?

444
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,615
Got a solid arrest
off her intel.

445
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,993
Yeah, but Grey's also evaluating
long-term prospects

446
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:57,952
and she doesn't have any.

447
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,370
Right.

448
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:01,539
Ever bother you
using people like that?

449
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,500
Nope. The drugs she's moving
kill people every day.

450
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,209
She's not a saint.

451
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,003
She's a criminal.
Right.

452
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:10,256
You didn't answer
my question.

453
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,091
You checking that box
and moving on?

454
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,343
No.
I need to find a real C.I.

455
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,970
Good answer.

456
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,185
So, where's your mom?

457
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,062
Uh...

458
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,856
She died last year.

459
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,941
Cervical cancer.

460
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,777
Oh. I'm sorry.

461
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,322
Thanks.

462
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,366
So, I left school
to be with my dad,

463
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,784
only to find out

464
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,953
that he'd been hooking up
with that trophy skank

465
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,830
while my mom
was in hospice.

466
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,375
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
go home tonight,

467
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,668
once you process out.

468
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,004
I don't have a choice.

469
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,339
Daisy convinced my dad

470
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,466
to hold on
to the money my mom left me

471
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,760
until after
I graduate from college.

472
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,845
Can he do that?

473
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,221
I don't know.

474
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,891
I can't really afford a lawyer
to find out.

475
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,853
Look, you are
in a bad situation,

476
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,814
but stealing, it's...

477
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,358
it's not gonna
make it better.

478
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,693
What will?

479
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,238
Am I crazy,
or was that way too easy?

480
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,657
It was a little easy.

481
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,908
On the other hand,

482
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:19,867
you showed Hickey
that you can get things done.

483
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,370
Lopez, West, my office.

484
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,790
I'm gonna call you back.

485
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,417
So, this is Special Agent
Wyck Bird from the FBI.

486
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,045
He says you're trying
to poach his informant.

487
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,005
Wait, sir,
I-I can explain.

488
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,090
Save your breath.

489
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,591
Hickey's mine.

490
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,052
Guy's a clearing house
of high-value intel.

491
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,888
Bureau doesn't need the LAPD
messing with our meal ticket.

492
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,598
I didn't know informants
came with exclusive rights.

493
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,766
Now you do.

494
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,145
He called you
to get us to back off.

495
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,439
And he used us
to do him a solid.

496
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,982
Now he's kicking us
to the curb.

497
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:52,858
He said
you were hassling him.

498
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,235
Stop hassling him.

499
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,319
Or else.

500
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,279
Sergeant.

501
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:58,698
Special Agent.

502
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,743
Sir --
Save it.

503
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,705
I told you what would happen
if you swung and missed.

504
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,707
You're dismissed.

505
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,341
So, you got a game plan
for running down a new C. I.?
Not yet.

506
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,592
Any suggestions?
Oh, that's right.

507
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,468
You're not here
to teach me.
Ms. Harper?

508
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,179
Hi.

509
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,849
Uh...um,
what are you doing here?

510
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:25,891
You didn't sign
your petition.

511
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,727
Right. I'm sorry.

512
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,270
I, um...
Excuse me. Hi.
John Nolan.

513
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,646
Hi. Good to meet you.
My name's --

514
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,106
None of his business.

515
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:35,901
Um...I'm gonna take 10,
you figure out a next step.

516
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,069
Come on.

517
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,867
This is bleak.

518
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:43,909
There's nowhere else
we can meet?

519
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,786
It's private.

520
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,247
I don't want anyone here
knowing my business.

521
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,498
Okay.

522
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,254
We got lucky
with the judge.

523
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,673
He believes
whenever possible,

524
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,800
it's important for the mother
to be part of the child's life.

525
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,887
Okay.

526
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:03,971
That's -- That's great.

527
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,693
How's it going here?

528
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,361
Uh, it's fine.

529
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,076
It's a lot harder than
I thought it would be.

530
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,579
What is?

531
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:29,997
Being normal.

532
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,375
You're doing great.

533
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,836
The better hours,
the new apartment --

534
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,214
the judge will be impressed.

535
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:41,217
I hope so.

536
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,886
'Cause if I don't
see my daughter soon,

537
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,471
I am gonna lose my mind.

538
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,185
Hey.

539
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,229
Hey, back at it already?

540
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,355
Yeah, couldn't sleep.

541
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,232
Just laid there,
staring at the ceiling.

542
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,359
Figured screw it --
I'll clock in early.

543
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,902
Can I ask you something?
Yeah, sure.

544
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,737
I need to recruit a C.I.

545
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,198
My first one --
she O. D.'d on me.

546
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,658
Oh.

547
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,159
You know what?
You need a forger.

548
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,911
They're at the hub of
all criminal activity.

549
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,621
Tell Logan
in Commercial Crimes

550
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,665
I asked him
to throw some names your way.

551
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:15,709
You are a life-saver.
Thank you.

552
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,254
Hey, John?
Yeah?

553
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:21,215
I ran a background check
on Henry's girlfriend.

554
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,175
Don't worry, I tied it
to an open investigation.

555
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,552
No one will ever know.

556
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,637
I-I didn't ask --
I know.

557
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,264
I know.

558
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,390
But if I were you,

559
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,350
I'd want to take a look
at what's inside.

560
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,731
What's that?

561
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,525
Nothing.

562
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,526
What was your thing about?

563
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,528
Nothing.
Great. Lunch?

564
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,571
Great.

565
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,615
So, what do I do?

566
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,867
Open it.

567
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,535
It's about
Henry's safety.

568
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,120
You should see
what it says.

569
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,333
Dad.
Hey!

570
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,501
Oh, my God.

571
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,253
You guys are all about
the surprises this week.

572
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:01,213
Hi, I'm Abigail --
Henry's fiancée.

573
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,673
Yeah, I know.

574
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,550
I just really love
saying that, so...

575
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,093
Congratulations.
Yeah, that's awesome.

576
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,303
What do you want to eat?

577
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,054
I'll come with you.
Okay. Good.

578
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,097
We'll be back.
Right.

579
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,143
May I take your order?

580
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:15,519
They look so happy.

581
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,645
I want that.

582
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,188
Baby steps.
Right.

583
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,399
Well, first, I have to get
my mother out of our apartment.

584
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,192
Yes.
They really do
seem happy.

585
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,071
Would I be sabotaging that

586
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,907
by reading
what's in this envelope,

587
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,867
or is that the illusion

588
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:33,495
and Abigail's just a time bomb
waiting to go off?

589
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,956
So, what's the next step
on the C.I. front?

590
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,750
Forger.

591
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,418
Who'd you get that from?
No one.

592
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,004
Detective Armstrong.

593
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,464
Cheating on me
with another detective?

594
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,382
I had no idea
we were exclusive.

595
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,636
Okay, we got too much,
but everything looked so good.

596
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,054
Perfect timing.

597
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,306
Uh, uh, Henry, Abigail,

598
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:53,974
this is Nyla Harper,
my training officer.

599
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,225
Nyla Harper,
Henry is my son.

600
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,435
And I know
what you're thinking --

601
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,895
far too young
to have a 20-year-old.

602
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,980
Nope.
Nice to meet you both.

603
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,607
Let's get to work.
Right.

604
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,400
Um, that's all you.
See you guys at home.

605
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,278
So, you got
a place to start,

606
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,780
or are we Googling
"forger"?

607
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,782
Ooh, I got a list.
Mm.

608
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,660
What did you think
of Abigail?

609
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,370
She seemed nice.
Why?

610
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,246
No reason.

611
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,498
They just got engaged.

612
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:18,540
Oh, good for them.

613
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,167
Yeah.

614
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,210
No?
Yeah.

615
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,503
No, I'm...

616
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,921
Yeah.
Oh.

617
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,130
It's great.
No, eh, eh...

618
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,718
Drunk driving --
Knock, knock.

619
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,136
Officers.

620
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,931
Can I help you?

621
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:34,890
Beat it.

622
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,813
This is your place?

623
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,481
Yes, sir.

624
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,234
You do head shots?
We sure do.

625
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,611
What about fake IDs?

626
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,946
No, sir.

627
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,247
Lying to a police officer --
that's a crime, isn't it?

628
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,957
Not as big a one
as forgery

629
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:02,084
and counterfeiting
government documents.

630
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:05,462
Just trying
to make a living.

631
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,882
These cellphone cameras
have killed my business.

632
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,050
Am I going to jail?

633
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,219
Well, that depends.

634
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,514
Maybe I can help you
if you help me.

635
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,641
I don't know
what that means.

636
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,060
Do you want me
to bribe you?

637
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,895
How much --
No. No. No.

638
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,566
That's not -- Okay.
How do I...

639
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:28,402
I need someone with their ear
to the street --

640
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:29,945
You're gonna be
his snitch.
My snitch.

641
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,573
We're gonna take all
this stolen property
as evidence.

642
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:34,742
We're gonna book it and tie it
to an unknown suspect.

643
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,076
If you screw us,

644
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,245
we will suddenly know
who the suspect is,

645
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,873
get a warrant,
and come arrest you.

646
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,625
We are looking for leads
on serious felons here, okay?

647
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,586
Not teenagers
trying to buy alcohol.

648
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:46,962
You making papers for anyone
like that right now?

649
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,592
I did get a head's up

650
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,177
about a big job
that might come my way.

651
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:54,970
Fake identities,
driver's licenses,

652
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,346
passports,
the works.

653
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,724
As soon as you get details,
you call me.

654
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,517
Do you understand?

655
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,685
Yeah.

656
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,687
Congrats.

657
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,106
You have a real C.I.

658
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,903
I'm on my way home now, Mom.

659
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,405
Yes, I got the shopping list
you texted.

660
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,658
There's no milk because I'm
lactose intolerant, remember?

661
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,786
Mom, I gotta go.

662
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:21,497
Opal, what's up?

663
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,666
Thank you.

664
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:26,794
Tim.

665
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,295
Yo?

666
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,047
Olivia showed up
at Opal's pawn shop

667
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,298
with more of
her step-mom's stuff,

668
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,508
but she didn't want money
this time.

669
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,258
She wanted a gun.

670
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:46,897
Police!

671
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,151
7-Adam-19 --
shots fired at our location.

672
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,611
Send back-up.

673
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,283
I hate you!

674
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,160
Drop the gun!

675
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,453
You turned my dad
against me!

676
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,496
Olivia, drop the gun!

677
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,872
She ruined everything!

678
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,499
Now!

679
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,045
Stand up.
Keep your hands up.

680
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,588
Do not move.

681
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,093
You've made this
so much worse.

682
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,845
Come on.

683
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:20,973
You are gonna pay
for those bags.

684
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,015
Ma'am, stay right there.

685
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,393
What's going on?

686
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:25,686
What the hell
are you doing here?

687
00:27:25,686 --> 00:27:27,145
I came to get
the rest of my things.

688
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,146
Wh-- Are you okay?

689
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,945
Officers,
would you like to see

690
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,656
where Mrs.
hides all her drugs?

691
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,824
Yes.

692
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,242
Yes, we would.

693
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:51,086
♪ They say Rocky
sold his soul ♪

694
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:54,131

695
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,674

697
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,429
About time.

698
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,763
It's way past your curfew.

699
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,056
Oh, very funny.

700
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,310
You have a lot of tattoos.

701
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,936
Oh, yeah. You like 'em?

702
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,981
Each one signifies
a meaningful moment of my life.

703
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:13,191
I'm trying to talk Henry
into getting one.

704
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,192
I have no idea
what I would get.

705
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,903
Yeah, well,
that's a decision

706
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,487
that will last you
a lifetime.

707
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,822
Yeah.
Oh, I see
what you did there,

708
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,240
Is anyone hungry?

709
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,746
I can tell
you're freaked out.

710
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,581
Don't be, okay?

711
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:28,624
Okay.

712
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,083
Okay.

713
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:35,047
♪ Well, the neon lights
are on the red ♪

714
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,014
Hello?

715
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,182
<i>Hey, it's John.</i>

716
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,934
I really hope
I'm not, um...

717
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,268
stepping over the line here,

718
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,396
but I really have no one
to talk to about...anything

719
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,773
parenting oriented.

720
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,149
<i>Never mind.</i>
<i>You know what?</i>

721
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,150
<i>I'll take care of this.</i>
<i>Just forget I called.</i>

722
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,735
John, how can I help?

723
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,237
I'm having
a parenting emergency.

724
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,823
Good thing I specialize
in emergency medicine.

725
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,283
Are you
still at the hospital?

726
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,493
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>for a couple more hours.</i>

727
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,912
Could I come
buy you a cup of coffee,

728
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:07,663
<i>ask you some questions?</i>

729
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,956
Of course.

730
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:09,957
Thank you.

731
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,377
I'm just gonna head right
back out for a little while.

732
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:15,003
Okay.
Oh, could you
pick up some pie?

733
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,005
Yeah, she loves pie.
I love pie.

734
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,091
Sure.

735
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,929
I feel like a monster.

736
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,555
You're not a monster.

737
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,349
I mean, you're a father.

738
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,851
So, I should just open this up
right now and read it?

739
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:30,852
Absolutely not.

740
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,104
But it's my job
to protect him.

741
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:33,855
It is your job
to respect him,

742
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,524
and running
secret background check

743
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:36,942
on the girl
he's in love with

744
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:37,985
is not doing that.

745
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,486
Okay,
but I didn't run this.

746
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,071
Doesn't matter.
No, no.

747
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,781
Of course not.

748
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,992
And yet, I still can't
bring myself to throw it away.

749
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:49,037
What if you read it?

750
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,288
And then that way,
you could just tell me

751
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,790
if she's a serial killer
or a mime.

752
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,501
No, but I will
throw it out for you.

753
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,586
But --

754
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,629
It's the right thing.

755
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:01,174
Hey, if you want to know
something about Abigail,

756
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:03,176
you should just ask her.

757
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,683
You're right.

758
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:10,934
Thank you.

759
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,353
You're welcome.

760
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,692
I messed up.

761
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,861
I tried to regain
all the ground I lost,

762
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:24,656
but it might have
just cost me my job.

763
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,452
You know, Lucy would tell me
about you at the academy,

764
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,788
how far ahead you were
from all your classmates.

765
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,874
Seems so long ago.

766
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:36,043
What happened
to that Jackson?

767
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:39,004
What happened to that young man
I met at graduation?

768
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,631
So full of confidence.

769
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:46,344
A lifetime of expectations
crashed headlong into reality.

770
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,347
Well, "Sometimes you win,
sometimes you learn."

771
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:51,933
Freud?

772
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,436
Cat poster Lucy
used to have in her room.

773
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,188
You need to get back
to the time

774
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,981
when you knew
who you were,

775
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,941
not who you were
trying to be.

776
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,321
Oh, my gosh.

777
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,364
You're absolutely right.

778
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,366
I can't start
counting up wins and losses

779
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,618
when the season's
just begun.

780
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,078
Morning.

781
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,872
Where did
the coffee cups go?

782
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,333
Oh, I moved them
next to the coffee maker.

783
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,835
I liked them
by the dishwasher.

784
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,420
That's ridiculous.

785
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,463
It is more convenient.

786
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,675
Did -- Did...

787
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,344
Did you rearrange
the furniture?

788
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:28,845
Yes.

789
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,181
There's a better flow
in the room this way.

790
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:33,642
That's...

791
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,018
That's great.

792
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,689
You know what?
Screw the FBI.

793
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,733
I'm gonna flip Hickey,
take him away from the Feds,

794
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,110
and show Grey that he's wrong
about me.

795
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,028
That's
a really bad idea...

796
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,238
but I love it.

797
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,240
Yes.
How you gonna
pull it off?

798
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,325
Okay, I-I stopped by
the men's detention center

799
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,618
on the way in,
spoke to Chandio,

800
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,786
and it turns out

801
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,204
he's not sleeping
with Hickey's ex-wife.

802
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,288
He's never even met her.

803
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,456
So, Hickey had another reason

804
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,333
to torpedo
the stolen car ring.
Exactly.

805
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,417
So, we find out
what that is,

806
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,920
and we can use it
to leverage Hickey.

807
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,713
They made contact last night.

808
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:07,676
Ordered, um, five full sets
of fake documents.

809
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:08,927
All young women?

810
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,679
Yeah.

811
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,430
Human trafficking?

812
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,682
Yeah.

813
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:14,850
Who's the buyer?

814
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,768
Cartel.

815
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,894
Not sure which one.

816
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,647
But they'll kill me

817
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,940
if they find out
I'm talking to you.

818
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,359
Where's the exchange
taking place?

819
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,445
Uh, Whiteman Airfield.

820
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,114
In two hours.

821
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,419
You sure he said noon?

822
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,253
Yeah, I wrote it down.

823
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,842
7-Adam-15 --
all units stand by off-site.

824
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,093
Target is running late.

825
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,678
Hold position
until further notice.

826
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,971
You think
he's gonna show?

827
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,723
If there's one thing
you can count on,

828
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:56,391
it's that criminals
are always late.

829
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,731
What?

830
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,232
Nothing.

831
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,526
What?

832
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,445
Trent Silver.

833
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,279
Name of the lawyer
you were talking to

834
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,572
at the precinct
yesterday.

835
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:13,074
I checked the sign-in sheet
at the front desk.

836
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,076
Why would you do that?

837
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,745
I'm a cop.

838
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,246
Curiosity's part of
the job description.

839
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,122
So, he does family law?

840
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,916
He's none of your business.

841
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,126
My personal life
is none of your business.

842
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,294
Why you're back
in uniform?

843
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:27,172
None of your business.
Are we clear?

844
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,382
For now.

845
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,226
Son of a...

846
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:42,312
Didn't someone from the FBI
call and talk to you guys?

847
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,231
I'm already taken.
Yeah, about that.

848
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:46,066
After we swept up
those stolen cars

849
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:47,317
and shut down
that dealership...

850
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,985
And learned
that you were lying

851
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,612
about the owner
sleeping with your ex...

852
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,821
It got us thinking.

853
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,281
So we did some digging,

854
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,533
and it seems that you paid
a visit to a few businesses

855
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,285
in that neighborhood
yesterday evening.

856
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,703
Tried to use
our show of force

857
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,330
as a means to extort
some hardworking men and women.

858
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,708
We've got you
on extortion.

859
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,168
We own you.

860
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,587
So, call the FBI
and let them know

861
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,464
that you are booked
for the foreseeable future.

862
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,590
Okay.

863
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,634
Alright, sure.

864
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,427
But I need to know how much
you're gonna pay for tips.

865
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,596
That's a fair question.
Totally.

866
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,847
The answer is...

867
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:18,682
Zero.
Zero.

868
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,734
Hello?

869
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,986
I read it.
<i>Read what?</i>

870
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,280
Wait...
the background check?

871
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,073
No. You threw that away.
I saw you.

872
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,825
I couldn't help myself.

873
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,618
I mean, I dug it
out of the trash
after you left.

874
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,911
No. Why?

875
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,913
You're supposed to be
the angel on my shoulder.

876
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,415
But I started thinking.

877
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,293
I mean, if this was my son,
what would I do?

878
00:34:46,293 --> 00:34:47,711
And then the next thing
I knew,

879
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:50,171
<i>I was tearing it open</i>
<i>and reading what was inside.</i>

880
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,882
I-Is it bad?
What does it say?

881
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,760
Two years ago,
Abigail was charged with arson

882
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,887
and use of
a caustic substance

883
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,639
against
a former boyfriend.

884
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,017
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

885
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,355
Nolan. Heads up.

886
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,316
I have to go.

887
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,445
7-Adam-15 --
target has arrived.

888
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,614
Single black SUV.
Wait for our signal.

889
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,531
Nice and easy.

890
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,450
Just go give them
the documents.

891
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,840
Police!
Hands where I can see them!

892
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,968
Get out of the car!
Do it now!

893
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,845
No, please.
You're making a mistake.

894
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,221
Are you being held
against your will?

895
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,973
Not by him.
He's helping us escape.

896
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,353
Wait.
Escape from who?

897
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,520
El Leon.

898
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,772
Head of
the Aquino Cartel?

899
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,315
He's my husband,

900
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,567
and these woman
"belong" to his men,

901
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,653
but we're finished
putting up with the abuse.

902
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,695
You have to let us go.

903
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,113
Ugh.

904
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,406
Who is that?
It's my husband.

905
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,741
He keeps calling,
telling me to go back.

906
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:00,950
You brought your phone?

907
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,452
Guaranteed
he's tracking that.

908
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,371
We gotta get out of here.

909
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,337
Get behind us.

910
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,672
7-Adam-15, converge on me.
Code 3.

911
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,143
Anybody raises the gun
above their waist

912
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,728
gets a hollow point
in the eye.

913
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,315
There's no need for that.

914
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,150
We're simply here to give
the ladies a ride home.

915
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,277
You the husband?
Nah.

916
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,238
I'm his attack dog.

917
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,864
Elena,
why do you do this?

918
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,574
You know
there's no place to go.

919
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,034
Get in the car.
All of you.

920
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,327
We won't.

921
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,537
Oh, yes, you will.

922
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,579
No, they won't.

923
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,456
Huh.
There's eight of us...

924
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,752
...and two of you.

925
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:55,046
Actually, there's
a whole lot more than two.

926
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,506
So, here's the new plan --

927
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,174
You, your boys

928
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,926
are gonna get
back in your cars

929
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,928
and you're gonna drive away,
empty-handed.

930
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,016
I'd say you got about 20 seconds
before the cavalry arrives.

931
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,560
This isn't over, Elena.

932
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,894
We'll get to you
soon enough.

933
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,749
Well, that was exciting.

934
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:31,875
I guess not for you.

935
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:33,251
That's probably
a regular Tuesday for you.

936
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,419
Oh, no.

937
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,254
The pucker factor
was definitely at 11.

938
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,471
West.

939
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,265
Nolan, Chen,
don't wander off.

940
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,516
Special Agent Bird
just called me --

941
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,559
Look, Sergeant,

942
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,019
it was my decision
to pursue Hickey

943
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,479
and try and steal him away
from the Feds.

944
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,689
Seems like you succeeded
from the way Bird was yelling.

945
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,608
Yes, sir.

946
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,652
Officer Lopez, is this
how you train your rookies?

947
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:02,697
To ignore the orders
of federal agents?

948
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,531
Pretty much, sir.

949
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,995
Any day we can remind
our federal brethren

950
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,830
that we are their equals...

951
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,166
is a day worth living.

952
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,211
It appears you three

953
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,588
successfully recruited
your first C. I. s,

954
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:22,425
and I'm impressed.

955
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,552
See you tomorrow.

956
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,137
Oh, Officer West?

957
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,473
Short sleeves, please.

958
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,391
Yes, sir.

959
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:35,980
♪ Oh, when I got you
by my side ♪

960
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,234
♪ Everything's alright ♪

961
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,528
Hey, why's your bag
by the door?

962
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:43,822
Your father is on his way
to pick me up.

963
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,490
He apologized.

964
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,200
He just needed
to miss me.

965
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,701
Oh.

966
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,537
He's downstairs.

967
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,498
Alright, sweetheart,
it's been a lovely visit.

968
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,874
Come by the office.

969
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,835
We can talk about
why you're not dating anyone.

970
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,378
Thank you, Jackson.

971
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,504
Bye, Mrs. Chen.

972
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,217
No wonder I can't find
a healthy relationship.

973
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:08,137
My dysfunctional parents are why
I am 28 and still single.

974
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,556
Are you sure that's why?

975
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,350
What's that
supposed to mean?

976
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,726
Look, I'm just saying

977
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,563
that your only real relationship
was with Nolan.

978
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,524
Yep.
I've known the whole time.
Wait --

979
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,775
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What?
You think I'm stupid?

980
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,361
No.
Listen -- You fell
for a divorced guy

981
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,822
coming out of
a 20-year marriage, okay?

982
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:26,906
I-It was safe.

983
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,241
Never meant to last.

984
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,994
Come on.
Let's go celebrate.

985
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:32,787
Tomorrow, my forearms
will be liberated.

986
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,455
It is pretty glorious.

987
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,416
Yeah, actually, how did you
get your parents to make up?

988
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,835
Oh. I got Wesley
to call each of them

989
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:40,003
pretending to be
a divorce lawyer,

990
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,463
telling them the costs
of a divorce,

991
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,048
and that snapped them out of it
pretty quick.

992
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,133
Well played.
Thank you.

993
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,342
Let's go.

994
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:49,470
Wait. Will you please,
please help me

995
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,264
get the furniture
back to where it was.

996
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,892
But it's better this way.
I know.

997
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:56,728
But will you help me get it
back to the way it was?

998
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,938
Yes.

999
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,064
Oh.

1000
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,190
Thank you.

1001
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,233
Yeah.
Thanks.

1002
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,905
Guys, there's something
I need to say.

1003
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,574
I know about the arson.

1004
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,159
You ran
a background check?

1005
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,952
You knew
she had a record?

1006
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,038
Yeah, she told me
on our third date.

1007
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,497
I...can't believe
you did that.

1008
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,166
It's okay.
He -- He did it to protect you.

1009
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,127
No, I don't need protecting,
especially from you.

1010
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,882
Do you want to know
what happened?

1011
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,426
If you want to tell me.

1012
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:35,767
An ex-boyfriend posted
some videos on the Internet...

1013
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:39,520
after we broke up.

1014
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,816
Personal videos of us...
together.

1015
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,947
He did it to get revenge,

1016
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,617
and it worked.

1017
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:56,746
He took something from me
I'll never get back.

1018
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,043
I'm so sorry.

1019
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,921
So, I went to his house...

1020
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:08,925
and I torched his car.

1021
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,596
And I got arrested
and he didn't.

1022
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,894
Happy now?

1023
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,565
Not in the least.

1024
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,529
Abigail...

1025
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:38,538
...I'm sorry my fear
overcame my judgement.

1026
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,707
I, uh...

1027
00:41:40,707 --> 00:41:41,916
I can't take that back,

1028
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,377
but I can promise you

1029
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:45,712
it won't happen again.

1030
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,968
That's good enough for me.

1031
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:58,224
Yeah.

1032
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,479
Okay.

1033
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,524
It's great that
that's behind us now,

1034
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,276
because I really am
pregnant.

1035
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,362
I'm kidding. Again.

1036
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,822
Oh, my --
Joke.

1037
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,490
Geez.

1038
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,950
Okay, we're gonna have
to work on the jokes, though.

1039
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,869
'Cause I already have
a high-stress job,

1040
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,663
and, uh...I think you're gonna
give me a heart attack.

1041
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,748
Understood.
