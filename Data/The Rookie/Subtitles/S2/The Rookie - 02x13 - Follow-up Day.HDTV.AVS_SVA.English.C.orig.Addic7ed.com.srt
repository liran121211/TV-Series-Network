1
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:05,890
John.

2
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:07,470
- Hey.
- How are you?

3
00:00:07,563 --> 00:00:08,882
Great. I was just, um...

4
00:00:08,931 --> 00:00:10,358
- I haven't seen you.
- Yeah, I know.

5
00:00:10,406 --> 00:00:11,586
I just was swamped with work

6
00:00:11,634 --> 00:00:13,188
and, uh, the kitchen renovation.

7
00:00:13,236 --> 00:00:14,664
How was your vacation with Oliver?

8
00:00:14,713 --> 00:00:16,324
Great! You know, we went to Utah,

9
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:18,384
- we hit all the state parks.
- Oh, it's so beautiful up there.

10
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,364
Seriously. I mean, stunning.

11
00:00:20,743 --> 00:00:22,163
I've been thinking about you.

12
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:23,493
- Really?
- Yeah.

13
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:25,166
Eh, would you be interested
in coming over

14
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:27,073
and helping me test out
the new kitchen?

15
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:28,260
You want me to cook for you?

16
00:00:28,309 --> 00:00:30,044
I would cook.

17
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:31,947
- I wouldn't say no to a-a co-pilot.
- Mm.

18
00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:33,711
My use of vegetables has been described

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,614
as a crime against humanity.

20
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:37,273
Kids can be so cruel.

21
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,058
Sure. I mean, I'd love to.

22
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,499
Why are you holding a towel?

23
00:00:42,556 --> 00:00:43,685
40-year-old male,

24
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:45,287
traumatic amputation of right hand

25
00:00:45,335 --> 00:00:46,521
in construction accident.

26
00:00:46,569 --> 00:00:49,424
BP 100/70, heart rate 110.

27
00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:52,360
Get him into Trauma Two,
page Ortho, and order an x-ray.

28
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:54,529
Start an IV with two liters of saline.

29
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:56,131
John, is that the...

30
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:58,366
Yes. Yeah, that's his.

31
00:00:58,414 --> 00:01:00,135
Hey, um, what time?

32
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:02,270
- Uh, 7:00?
- It's a date.

34
00:01:20,837 --> 00:01:22,457
So, what are you gonna cook her?

35
00:01:22,505 --> 00:01:25,727
Couple of big-ass steaks
and a lovely baked potato.

36
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:27,762
- What?
- You know we're in L.A.?

37
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,164
She's at least a pescatarian.

38
00:01:29,212 --> 00:01:30,598
And she definitely doesn't eat carbs.

39
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:32,567
- So, no potato?
- Your safest bet

40
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:35,337
is a kale salad with
a nice piece of salmon.

41
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:36,905
Man, food used to be so easy.

42
00:01:36,953 --> 00:01:38,858
There was only two kinds...
Fried and other.

43
00:01:38,907 --> 00:01:40,361
- Okay, Grandpa.
- Nolan.

44
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,177
There's a lawyer looking
for you at the front desk.

45
00:01:42,225 --> 00:01:44,159
Uh-oh. What'd you do?

46
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,084
- Are you John Nolan?
- That depends on...

47
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,453
Are you here to
serve me with a subpoena?

48
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:53,704
No. I'm a trust and estates lawyer.

49
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:55,194
Susan Banker, I'm here to inform you

50
00:01:55,243 --> 00:01:56,929
about what your
father left you in his will.

51
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:58,428
What... Wait.

52
00:01:58,577 --> 00:01:59,964
- My father's dead?
- Yes.

53
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:01,664
I'm sorry. Did no one tell you that?

54
00:02:01,801 --> 00:02:04,449
I haven't spoken to
my father in 35 years.

55
00:02:04,617 --> 00:02:06,513
He left me something in his will?

56
00:02:06,652 --> 00:02:07,905
Was it a lot of something?

57
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,640
$14 and his 1971 Chevelle.

58
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:11,669
- You're kidding.
- No. There's the check.

59
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:13,331
The car will be delivered later today.

60
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,544
And what if I don't want the car?

61
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,659
Then get rid of it.

62
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:17,548
Just sign the bottom...

63
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,262
...confirming your
receipt of the check.

64
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:20,912
Eh, how did he die?

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,954
Heart attack. Or drowning.

66
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:24,276
He was in the pool at his house

67
00:02:24,325 --> 00:02:25,472
in Tempe when it hit.

68
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,120
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:29,737 --> 00:02:31,106
What's going on?

70
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:32,552
We're celebrating Smitty's last day

71
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,192
as Mr. Irrelevant.

72
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,517
The sergeants exam happens
once every two years.

73
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:38,135
Whoever scores the lowest gets called

74
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:40,276
Mr. Irrelevant
'cause they got no chance

75
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:41,463
- at getting promoted.
- Hey!

76
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,098
So, if this is Smitty's swan song,

77
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:45,618
that means the new scores
are gonna be posted soon.

78
00:02:45,723 --> 00:02:47,626
- Tonight.
- That's exciting.

79
00:02:47,693 --> 00:02:49,692
- You're gonna do great.
- No doubt.

80
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:53,957
Hey.

81
00:02:54,123 --> 00:02:55,746
You alright?

82
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,752
My dad died.

83
00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,957
I'm so sorry. Are... Are you okay?

84
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:01,552
Yeah, I honestly

85
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:03,428
never knew the man.

86
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:05,090
It's just a little unexpected.

87
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:06,957
Alright. Well, if you need anything...

88
00:03:07,006 --> 00:03:08,292
Nah. I'm fine.

89
00:03:08,347 --> 00:03:10,080
Honestly. I'm good. Thank you.

90
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:12,736
Alright. Party's over.

91
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,383
So, Officer Smitty...
These past two years,

92
00:03:15,432 --> 00:03:17,353
you have handled your irrelevance

93
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:19,044
with the poise and dignity

94
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:20,918
I expect from a man of...

95
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,794
Of little ambition.

96
00:03:22,874 --> 00:03:25,540
Thank you, sir.

97
00:03:26,183 --> 00:03:27,330
To business.

98
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:28,798
Today is Follow-Up Day.

99
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:30,600
Detectives have several cases

100
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:33,060
that are on the edge
of being back-burnered.

101
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:34,363
You're gonna take the day

102
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:36,566
to see if you can breathe
new life into them.

103
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:38,247
So, Bradford and Chen,

104
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,784
you have a three-day-old home invasion.

105
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:43,817
The victim is a former
gang member, Nevin Cooper.

106
00:03:43,928 --> 00:03:45,715
No forensics, no suspects.

107
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:46,931
We're on it, sir.

108
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,986
Lopez and West,
you're going to Hancock Park.

109
00:03:50,035 --> 00:03:52,822
A statue was stolen from
a homeowner's front yard.

110
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,488
It looks like a giant turd.

111
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:56,174
Well, that "turd" is worth
a half a million,

112
00:03:56,223 --> 00:03:57,978
- so track it down.
- Yes, sir.

113
00:03:58,027 --> 00:04:00,642
Which brings me to Harper and Nolan.

114
00:04:00,704 --> 00:04:02,699
Actually, sir,
Robbery Homicide requested

115
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:04,433
that Officer Nolan and I

116
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:06,140
follow up on one of their cases.

117
00:04:06,305 --> 00:04:08,426
And how much did you pay
for them to request that?

118
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,714
That's a very cynical question, sir.

119
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:12,378
- Seems fair to me.
- Yeah.

120
00:04:12,494 --> 00:04:14,462
What do you think, Officer Nolan?

121
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,881
What?

122
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:21,664
On it. Yes, sir.

123
00:04:25,737 --> 00:04:27,323
Hey, you sure you're alright?

124
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,492
There's no shame in
taking a personal day.

125
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,860
Oh. Yeah, I know.

126
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:32,762
Uh, just seemed so disingenuous,
you know?

127
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,531
Last time I saw my dad, I was ten.

128
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:37,592
He was driving away in that Chevelle.

129
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,836
The car he left me.

130
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:41,738
Sounds like the plot of
a bad first novel.

131
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:44,937
- No offense.
- No. No, you're not wrong.

132
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,510
Hey, listen.

133
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:49,512
It's one thing to lose focus
during roll call,

134
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,615
but out here, you get
distracted, you get killed.

135
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:54,246
So I need you sharp.

136
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:55,683
I am.

137
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,790
I will be.

138
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:01,724
We're closed.

139
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,135
Police.

140
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:05,605
Uh, we're following up
for Detective Calderon.

141
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,955
We're just checking in to see if
you've thought of anything new

142
00:05:08,004 --> 00:05:09,531
that might help us catch the guy

143
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,601
who robbed you and killed your wife.

144
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:14,704
No. He came inside
and hit me right away.

145
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:18,192
Uh, I couldn't do anything to stop him.

146
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:20,472
To save her.

147
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:22,806
Sir, we're very sorry for your loss.

148
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,318
You told detectives the man
was wearing a mask?

149
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,493
Yes.

150
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,030
And he took several hundred dollars

151
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,832
from the register
and a case of whiskey?

152
00:05:29,881 --> 00:05:31,682
Well, another thing.

153
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:35,395
I didn't notice it until this morning

154
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:36,534
when I started to clean,

155
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,024
but there was a new roll of scratchers

156
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,333
under the counter.

157
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:42,049
They're not there now.
He must have taken them.

158
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:43,461
Scratch-off lottery tickets?

159
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,268
Yes. Um... like these.

160
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,846
High value. 500 tickets a roll.

161
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:50,883
- Did you report those as stolen?
- An hour ago.

162
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:52,509
That's how we're gonna catch this guy.

163
00:05:52,587 --> 00:05:53,917
Uh, sir, the lottery office

164
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,323
will flag all the serial numbers

165
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:56,664
and cancel the tickets.

166
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:59,218
If he tries to redeem a winner,
it'll get flagged.

167
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,260
Good. I hope you catch him.

168
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,057
And I hope he gives you
a good reason to kill him.

169
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,197
Sir.

170
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:08,361
We will keep you posted.

171
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,855
Uh, if anything else occurs to you,

172
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,392
just give us a call.

173
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:13,316
Why did you stop me?

174
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:15,900
It is not our job to police his grief.

175
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:26,934
Good morning, officers.
What can I get you?

176
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:28,600
We're looking for Nevin Cooper.

177
00:06:28,877 --> 00:06:30,583
Oh. He's a little busy right now.

178
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:32,214
Can I help you with something?

179
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:41,249
Hey, everything okay?

180
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,423
Yeah.

181
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:45,762
It's just some confusion in our order.

182
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:48,620
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

183
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:52,438
Marquel, right?

184
00:06:52,591 --> 00:06:53,978
I know you?

185
00:06:54,027 --> 00:06:56,425
I'm the guy who put
Keon in Pelican Bay.

186
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,139
Heard you filled the void.

187
00:06:58,195 --> 00:06:59,739
Ah, what can I say?

188
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:01,067
"Some are born great,"

189
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:02,285
"some achieve greatness,"

190
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:04,262
"and some have
greatness thrust upon them."

191
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,953
- Shakespeare.
- Play?

192
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:08,503
"Twelfth Night."

193
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:10,623
Smart for a cop.

194
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:13,926
I read you weren't running
with these guys anymore, Nevin.

195
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,628
Found a different path in prison.

196
00:07:15,792 --> 00:07:17,913
Bitch binge-watched
too much British baking.

197
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,099
Got himself rehabilitated.

198
00:07:20,147 --> 00:07:21,555
It's not every day that you see a gang

199
00:07:21,604 --> 00:07:23,903
be so forgiving to someone
who's left the flock.

200
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:25,438
That's inspiring.

201
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:27,106
Unless you're here to sweat him.

202
00:07:27,154 --> 00:07:28,407
You guys wouldn't happen to know

203
00:07:28,455 --> 00:07:30,281
who broke into Nevin's
house a couple nights ago,

204
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,111
- tied him up?
- I sure don't.

205
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:34,143
But I tell you what, I hear anything,

206
00:07:34,192 --> 00:07:36,128
you will be my first call.

207
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:38,682
I'll see you around, Nevin.

208
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,356
- You alright?
- Fine.

209
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,987
Got a lot of work to do
and it's tight in here,

210
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,567
so, Sasha'll give you
some donuts on your way out.

211
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,132
I know you're scared, but we can help.

212
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,262
I'm not scared. I'm busy.

213
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:55,380
I got things handled.

214
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:57,620
Okay, so, why call the cops
if you got it handled?

215
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,039
- I didn't.
- Let me guess. Sasha did.

216
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:02,008
Before you could tell her not to?

217
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:06,328
I appreciate what you're trying to do...

218
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:07,659
Turn your life around.

219
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,380
- I know it isn't easy.
- It is what it is, man.

220
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:11,350
You can't handle Marquel
and his crew on your own.

221
00:08:11,414 --> 00:08:12,834
I don't know what you're talking about.

222
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,107
They just came to buy some pastries.

223
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:17,637
Now I gotta get back to work.

224
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,208
Sure.

225
00:08:21,257 --> 00:08:23,314
You change your mind,
you know where to find us.

226
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:29,035
Looks like that's where the statue was.

227
00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:30,870
You're gonna make a great detective.

228
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:35,161
Why haven't you guys
found my statue yet?

229
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,260
That's why we're here, sir...

230
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,589
To see if you have any new information.

231
00:08:37,637 --> 00:08:39,224
If have any new information?

232
00:08:39,676 --> 00:08:41,130
This is your job.

233
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,582
I've been calling you every day.

234
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,911
Yes, sir, we're aware.
That's why we're here.

235
00:08:45,114 --> 00:08:46,314
Did they find it?

236
00:08:46,432 --> 00:08:47,499
No.

237
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:50,523
Ma'am,
I read over the initial police report.

238
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,088
What exactly did you mean when you said

239
00:08:52,137 --> 00:08:53,952
that whoever took it
should get a reward?

240
00:08:55,085 --> 00:08:58,028
- What the hell?
- I did not say that.

241
00:08:58,366 --> 00:09:00,020
- Did I?
- Mrs. Nithercott,

242
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,223
did you have anything to do

243
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:02,710
with the disappearance of the statue?

244
00:09:02,766 --> 00:09:04,443
Of course not.

245
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:08,407
No, uh, just I'm not as sad
as Roger is that it's gone.

246
00:09:08,535 --> 00:09:10,775
What are you saying?
I thought you loved that piece.

247
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:12,286
It looks like a dinosaur

248
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:14,434
copped a squat on our front yard.

249
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:17,996
I bought it, because it
reminded me of our honeymoon.

250
00:09:18,045 --> 00:09:20,246
How does that remind you
of your honeymoon?

251
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:22,746
Maybe I don't want to know.

252
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:24,256
Look, you wanna find the thief?

253
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:26,667
Talk to the members of
the homeowners association.

254
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:28,468
They hated that thing as much as I did.

255
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:32,754
You ever play the lottery?

256
00:09:32,957 --> 00:09:35,016
Only when the
jackpot goes to a billion.

257
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:37,255
- You?
- Every week for 20 years,

258
00:09:37,304 --> 00:09:38,967
when I lived back in Foxburg.

259
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:40,473
Buy a ticket at the gas station

260
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:41,874
on the way home on a Friday night,

261
00:09:41,922 --> 00:09:43,442
spend the time it took me
to fill my tank

262
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,544
just fantasizing what I
would do with the money.

263
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:47,046
And?

264
00:09:47,147 --> 00:09:48,429
Mostly I would just think about

265
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:49,590
what life would be like

266
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,083
if I never had to worry
about money again.

267
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:52,952
Oh, yeah. That would be nice.

268
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:55,293
I can barely see the edge
of the hole I'm in.

269
00:09:55,491 --> 00:09:57,379
<i>7-Adam-15, give the bridge a call.</i>

270
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:01,475
Yeah, this is Officer Nolan.
I was asked to call.

271
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,497
Right. Thank you.

272
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,697
My inheritance has arrived.

273
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,367
- Hey.
- Hey.

274
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,219
Nice car. It's a classic.

275
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:20,086
Yeah. It has a matching 350 four-barrel

276
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:21,747
with an original turbo trans.

277
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:23,611
You drive it all the way
in from Arizona?

278
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,749
No.

279
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:26,484
No, I,
uh... I actually drove it to New York

280
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:27,860
and then I got on a cargo ship

281
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:29,777
and then we went
through the Panama Canal.

282
00:10:31,563 --> 00:10:33,236
No need to be an ass about it.

283
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:35,286
What do you think I could get for it?

284
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,014
I don't know, man.
W-What, you want to sell it?

285
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:40,132
I don't know. The guy who
left it to me was bad news.

286
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,345
Real piece of crap.

287
00:10:42,596 --> 00:10:43,969
- Hey!
- Don't talk about my dad!

288
00:10:44,017 --> 00:10:45,638
Hands behind your back!

289
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,736
Ow!

290
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,462
Your dad?

291
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,963
That would make him...

292
00:10:52,012 --> 00:10:53,989
- My brother.
- Half-brother.

293
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:01,795
Wait. Just wait. Just... Just stop.

294
00:11:02,398 --> 00:11:05,186
- What is your name?
- Pete. Nolan.

295
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:07,390
- And your father was?
- Charles.

296
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:08,741
He had a beer belly,

297
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,012
he had blue eyes,
a Marine Corps tattoo.

298
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,595
I don't know, he liked to take
his teeth out at parties.

299
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:15,863
He was quite a character!

300
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:16,964
You got me on that last one.

301
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:19,463
He was 35 when he abandoned
my mom and me.

302
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,383
Alright, what do you want to do here?

303
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:25,488
Take off the cuffs.

304
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:27,101
- You're gonna let me go?
- Yes.

305
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:28,776
Are you sure?
'Cause the last cop I punched

306
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:30,022
was not that cool about it.

307
00:11:30,088 --> 00:11:31,613
How many cops have you punched?

308
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:33,147
Like, today, or, like, ever?

309
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:36,121
I'm kidding. One.

310
00:11:36,233 --> 00:11:37,952
Five. I've punched five cops.

311
00:11:38,226 --> 00:11:39,280
Look...

312
00:11:39,377 --> 00:11:41,288
Before today,
I didn't even know I had a brother.

313
00:11:41,337 --> 00:11:42,778
Half-brother, alright?

314
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,792
And I was just as surprised
when the chick read the will

315
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,120
and said that you were getting the car.

316
00:11:46,168 --> 00:11:47,106
I don't know why he did that.

317
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:49,063
Yeah. I don't know
why he did that, either.

318
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:52,640
Now, if I'm free to go,
uh, I'm gonna go.

319
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,981
Back to Arizona, alright?

320
00:11:58,066 --> 00:12:01,621
Um... look, this has all
been a bit of a shock,

321
00:12:01,796 --> 00:12:04,812
but if you'd like to... wait
around till after my shift,

322
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,681
- I don't know, maybe we could...
- What?

323
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:08,280
Hang out and get to know each other

324
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,116
and become best friends?

325
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:11,521
No.

326
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:13,600
I'll pass, enjoy the car.

327
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:15,603
Nice meeting you.

328
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,307
It's a push.

329
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:22,973
Lunch?

330
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:25,226
So, how does it work?

331
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:26,497
The sergeants exam?

332
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,802
Do you get the stripe right away?

333
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,919
No. Passing the test is the first step.

334
00:12:29,968 --> 00:12:31,773
You only get promoted
when a spot opens up.

335
00:12:31,822 --> 00:12:34,110
If you're at the top of the
list, might take a month or two.

336
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,974
The lower you are,
the longer it's gonna take.

337
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:37,734
And for some, they'll never get a shot.

338
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:39,431
Be taking the test again in two years.

339
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,617
Hey.

340
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,920
Your home invasion
victim was just assaulted.

341
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:44,452
He's on his way to the ER.

342
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:45,917
Nevin? We just saw him.

343
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:47,889
Yeah, Marquel must have
doubled back after we left.

344
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:49,198
Is he hurt bad?

345
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:50,725
Fractured right arm, bruised ribs,

346
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:52,326
couple of loose teeth.

347
00:12:52,662 --> 00:12:54,497
He's gonna be in pain for a few weeks.

348
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,298
Do you guys know who did it?

349
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:58,966
Yeah, but we can't do anything about it

350
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:00,717
unless Nevin makes an official ID.

351
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:02,286
Which he's not going to do.

352
00:13:03,936 --> 00:13:05,758
But maybe his girlfriend will.

353
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:08,890
Good luck.

354
00:13:12,394 --> 00:13:13,739
How is he?

355
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,383
He's tough.

356
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:16,884
Didn't want me to call 911,

357
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:18,519
even though the bone was sticking out.

358
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:19,779
I'm sorry.

359
00:13:19,828 --> 00:13:21,003
That sounds upsetting.

360
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:23,391
He's trying so hard to make up
for the things he did.

361
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:24,859
Why can't they just leave him alone?

362
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:26,302
Because they're predators.

363
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:28,162
- But, we can help.
- How?

364
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:30,231
He's here because you
came around this morning.

365
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:32,733
Marquel had to make sure that
Nevin wasn't snitching.

366
00:13:32,781 --> 00:13:34,351
Snitching about what?

367
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:37,194
No way.

368
00:13:37,327 --> 00:13:39,487
Sasha, you walk away,

369
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:41,523
he ends up back in prison or dead.

370
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:43,544
Look, without us,
Nevin either gives in,

371
00:13:43,592 --> 00:13:45,208
gives Marquel what he wants,

372
00:13:45,303 --> 00:13:47,178
or he doesn't and Marquel kills him.

373
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,851
We're his only hope
at a different outcome.

374
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:51,877
You promise you can protect him?

375
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,048
I'd be lying if I said yes,

376
00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:56,290
but he's got no chance without us.

377
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:04,755
Marquel wants Nevin
to launder drug money

378
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:06,226
through the bakery.

379
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:09,083
Said he had 24 hours to decide.

380
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:12,773
Now you know.

381
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,057
So, what's the play?

382
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:22,598
Arrest Marquel for assault?

383
00:14:22,672 --> 00:14:23,846
No.

384
00:14:24,005 --> 00:14:25,316
We do that, and Marquel's guys

385
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:26,737
will kill Sasha and Nevin.

386
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,206
Then what?

387
00:14:28,513 --> 00:14:29,991
I don't know.

388
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,823
Neighbor says
she didn't witness the theft,

389
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,251
but, quote, "That statue
was the real crime."

390
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,897
And the woman I talked to
said that she wished

391
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:37,565
she had the balls to steal
that thing years ago,

392
00:14:37,613 --> 00:14:38,917
and whoever took it should have

393
00:14:38,966 --> 00:14:40,349
a statue erected in their honor.

394
00:14:40,974 --> 00:14:43,839
Alright. One more house
and I'm calling it.

395
00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:46,765
Police!

396
00:14:47,281 --> 00:14:49,282
There's a car in the driveway.

397
00:14:51,745 --> 00:14:53,015
LAPD!

398
00:14:53,112 --> 00:14:55,113
We just have a few questions for you.

399
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:58,185
I guess we can follow up tomorrow.

400
00:14:58,319 --> 00:14:59,622
Help!

401
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:01,571
Did you hear that?

402
00:15:01,904 --> 00:15:03,938
- Hear what?
- Help!

403
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:07,233
Help!

404
00:15:11,573 --> 00:15:13,207
Help!

405
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:15,617
Help!

406
00:15:19,054 --> 00:15:20,523
Oh.

407
00:15:26,662 --> 00:15:29,016
- Oh, God.
- Oh! God!

408
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:31,572
Think how I feel.
I've been lying in it.

409
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,273
I have a brother.

410
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:35,623
My father is dead,
and I have a brother.

411
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:37,852
Yeah, we've been through
all of this at some length.

412
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,906
I mean, yesterday,
I didn't have a brother,

413
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:41,528
and today, I have a brother.

414
00:15:41,577 --> 00:15:43,631
That is a serious shift
in the universe.

415
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,732
Is it?

416
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:46,250
Look, I mean, real siblings are

417
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:48,970
people that you share
your childhood with.

418
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,711
That guy shares some DNA.

419
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:52,640
Doesn't make him your brother.

420
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:54,858
Got your suspect in interrogation.

421
00:15:54,907 --> 00:15:56,271
Northeast Division caught her

422
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,480
trying to cash in
one of the stolen scratchers

423
00:15:59,528 --> 00:16:01,315
at a 7-Eleven in Los Feliz.

424
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,077
Her?

425
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:06,675
Smitty, our killer is a six foot,
200-pound male.

426
00:16:07,021 --> 00:16:08,731
Well, she's none of those things.

427
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:11,659
<i>I didn't know the scratcher
was stolen, okay?</i>

428
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:13,050
<i>I swear.</i>

429
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,495
<i>Where'd you get the ticket?</i>

430
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:16,468
<i>- Work.</i>
- And work is?

431
00:16:16,627 --> 00:16:17,780
The Red Angel.

432
00:16:17,946 --> 00:16:19,000
Strip club.

433
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:20,916
You know, I've had some
pretty pathetic tips before,

434
00:16:20,964 --> 00:16:22,630
but this is the first one
that's landed me in jail.

435
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:24,349
Relax. You're not under arrest.

436
00:16:24,398 --> 00:16:26,540
We just need the name of the guy
who gave you the ticket.

437
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,709
I don't know.

438
00:16:27,805 --> 00:16:30,044
From the stage,
it's just a sea of losers.

439
00:16:30,138 --> 00:16:31,530
- No offense.
- None taken.

440
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:33,214
I don't really frequent those.

441
00:16:33,262 --> 00:16:35,449
I mean, I've been.
I just don't make a habit of...

442
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:37,184
Does the club have cameras?

443
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,526
- Not officially.
- That's a yes.

444
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:41,552
I'll call the club and get
the footage sent over,

445
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:44,130
and then you and Chastity
can go through every frame,

446
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,360
and find the guy that
tipped her the ticket.

447
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:47,692
Together?

448
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:50,338
As in she'll be watching me
as I watch her...

449
00:16:50,387 --> 00:16:52,852
As in... you're solving a murder.

450
00:16:52,987 --> 00:16:54,488
Right.

451
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:58,463
Stealing that statue
was a public service.

452
00:16:58,512 --> 00:16:59,974
That almost got you killed.

453
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:01,576
Still worth it.

454
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:04,546
Angela. Excuse me. Angela.

455
00:17:04,748 --> 00:17:06,113
Oh.

456
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:07,415
Is this your station?

457
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,116
What a funny little world.

458
00:17:09,164 --> 00:17:10,463
Who's that?

459
00:17:10,512 --> 00:17:11,818
Wesley's mom.

460
00:17:13,555 --> 00:17:14,742
What's she in for?

461
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,909
They found an unlicensed gun in
her car during a traffic stop.

462
00:17:24,827 --> 00:17:26,115
Oh, wait. Here.

463
00:17:26,186 --> 00:17:28,073
I'm about to do one of
my signature moves.

464
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:31,648
How is that even possible?

465
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:34,161
Uh, the key is core strength,

466
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,197
and pride in my downstairs area.

467
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:38,493
Well, it's well-earned.

468
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:40,236
Thanks.

469
00:17:40,587 --> 00:17:41,873
Got somewhere else to be?

470
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,638
No. I... Kind of.

471
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:46,040
It's... I-I have a date.
It's not for a few hours.

472
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:47,708
Oh, good for you.

473
00:17:47,851 --> 00:17:49,076
Dating is challenging,

474
00:17:49,124 --> 00:17:50,477
especially towards the beginning.

475
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:52,614
Well, this is, uh, an old
girlfriend, actually.

476
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:54,085
Oh.

477
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:55,618
Making what's old new again.

478
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,108
Yeah.

479
00:17:57,547 --> 00:17:59,187
Seem a little nervous, though.

480
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:01,556
Well, when... when we
were together before,

481
00:18:01,604 --> 00:18:03,524
it was, you know, magical.

482
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:04,734
It just...

483
00:18:04,815 --> 00:18:06,194
That was a long time ago.

484
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:08,563
Have you talked to her
about your fears?

485
00:18:11,146 --> 00:18:12,533
- No.
- Men.

486
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,515
You are incapable of communicating

487
00:18:14,564 --> 00:18:16,811
with someone you care about,
but have no problem

488
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,073
being explicit with some
stranger in a thong.

489
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:22,243
Oh. Oh, there he is.

490
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:24,055
Scratch-off guy.

491
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,846
Right before we went
upstairs for a private.

492
00:18:25,894 --> 00:18:28,249
That is a nice, clear image.

493
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:30,655
We should be able to get a match
off facial recognition.

494
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:34,222
So, I, like... cracked the case?

495
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,600
Yes, you did.

496
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:36,676
Cool.

497
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:38,259
I'll walk you out.

498
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:40,094
Well, if you ever
wanna come by the club,

499
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:41,442
I'll give you a free lap dance.

500
00:18:41,491 --> 00:18:42,629
Oh, thanks. That's very sweet.

501
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:44,598
We should probably just keep
this professional, though.

502
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:45,303
Okay.

503
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:46,395
Hey, man.

504
00:18:46,444 --> 00:18:47,902
- Hey.
- Hey, I, uh...

505
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,437
I just want to say sorry for earlier.

506
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:52,035
I-I know things got a little
out of hand, you know?

507
00:18:52,084 --> 00:18:53,244
It's pretty normal for me, but, uh,

508
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:54,613
I know you don't know me
that well, so...

509
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:56,928
You were going through
some stuff, so it's okay.

510
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:58,486
Like I said, I just, uh...

511
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:01,249
I just wanted to say sorry, and, uh...

512
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,009
And I did, so...

513
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,588
Alright.

514
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:08,222
Hey. Where are you staying?

515
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,131
I'm renovating a house on Beechwood.

516
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,780
You're welcome to use the guest room.

517
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,219
Oh, it's okay, man. I'm staying
at the Starlight Motel.

518
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:16,715
Plus, I gotta catch this bus to
Tempe in the morning, so...

519
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:18,799
Oh. I love Tempe. I did the, uh...

520
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:20,728
The Ironman competition there twice.

521
00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:22,097
Oh, cool.

522
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:24,365
I've never been to the gym.

523
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:26,641
Uh, Pete, this is Chastity.
Chastity, Pete.

524
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,276
- Hey.
- Hello.

525
00:19:28,395 --> 00:19:32,313
Um... do you wanna, like,
go get, uh, sushi or something?

526
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:33,561
Yeah. Okay.

527
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,764
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

528
00:19:34,813 --> 00:19:36,338
Sick. Alright.

529
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:38,819
Hey, man, uh... you think
I could have some money

530
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:40,254
for that sushi date?

531
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:43,444
Yeah.

532
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:47,595
Thank you, man.

533
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:49,892
It's... It's L.A. sushi.

534
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:54,302
Don't worry about paying me back.

535
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,317
I won't. Have a good one.

536
00:19:57,653 --> 00:19:59,940
That was weird. Me and him. Huh?

537
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:03,275
Stay out of trouble. If you can.

538
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,093
<i>This is serious.
They found a gun in your car.</i>

539
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:08,616
<i>Well, you know how dangerous
this city can be.</i>

540
00:20:08,664 --> 00:20:10,351
<i>A woman has to be able
to protect herself.</i>

541
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:12,153
Mom, where did you even get the gun?

542
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:14,009
Christian.

543
00:20:14,096 --> 00:20:16,223
The... The tennis instructor?

544
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,075
Well, we're dating now.

545
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:20,612
Don't say it.
I know what you're gonna say.

546
00:20:20,661 --> 00:20:22,363
He likes me for me.

547
00:20:22,411 --> 00:20:24,151
- It's not my money.
- Mom, come on.

548
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,690
Don't tell Angela
about Christian, please.

549
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,011
I don't want him to get in trouble.

550
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,527
Promise me, now.

551
00:20:31,353 --> 00:20:33,521
Yes. I promise.

552
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,942
Lawrence. Oh, how nice to see you.

553
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,014
Patrice. Wesley.

554
00:20:40,062 --> 00:20:41,682
- It's been far too long.
- Uh-huh.

555
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,074
You called the family lawyer?

556
00:20:43,123 --> 00:20:44,652
I thought I was gonna handle this.

557
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:46,463
Oh. Oh, sweetie, I love you,

558
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:49,190
but, you work above
an Ethiopian restaurant.

559
00:20:49,239 --> 00:20:51,861
And... you need a "real" lawyer.

560
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,961
I knew you'd understand.

561
00:20:57,338 --> 00:20:58,624
Well?

562
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:01,184
My mom fired me.

563
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:02,788
- Ouch.
- Mm.

564
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,126
Did she say where she got the gun?

565
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:07,708
Yeah, but it's privileged.
I can't tell you.

566
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:09,437
Well, she's got to give the guy up.

567
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:10,685
Ballistics came back.

568
00:21:10,734 --> 00:21:11,851
The gun in her car was used in

569
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,470
an armed robbery six months ago.

570
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,615
Homeowner was shot.

571
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:16,760
She's looking at accessory
after the fact.

572
00:21:19,835 --> 00:21:21,804
- Welcome.
- Hi.

573
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:23,357
Hi.

574
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:27,928
Coat.

575
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,398
Something to drink?

576
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:31,957
Sure.

577
00:21:32,114 --> 00:21:33,300
Your place looks great.

578
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:34,435
Oh, thank you.

579
00:21:36,418 --> 00:21:37,567
Hope you like white.

580
00:21:37,616 --> 00:21:38,873
Did someone punch you?

581
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:42,038
Yes. Um... I have had a day.

582
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,411
Do you want to talk about it?

583
00:21:43,459 --> 00:21:44,684
If I start talking about it,

584
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:46,153
the whole night's gonna be about that,

585
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:48,382
and I want tonight to be about us.

586
00:21:52,092 --> 00:21:53,312
So, what do I do?

587
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:56,624
The smart thing would be to get
Nevin to launder the money.

588
00:21:57,176 --> 00:22:00,248
Use him as a CI to roll up
Marquel and his whole crew.

589
00:22:00,303 --> 00:22:02,169
Um, Nevin's trying to go straight.

590
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:03,372
We'd be destroying that.

591
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:05,140
Yes, in order to put some

592
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:06,776
pretty bad people behind bars.

593
00:22:06,824 --> 00:22:09,852
Look, it's a tough call, but...

594
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,175
You're gonna have to get used to
making those as a sergeant.

595
00:22:14,198 --> 00:22:16,483
- The scores are in?
- The list just arrived.

596
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,221
You're number 8 out of 140.

597
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:20,101
Yes! I knew it.

598
00:22:23,124 --> 00:22:25,838
Congratulations... Sergeant Bradford.

599
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,099
Not a sergeant yet.

600
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:29,455
At eight on the list,
it'll probably take six months or so.

601
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:32,447
Actually, there's a position
opening in North Hollywood.

602
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:34,373
The captain there owes me a big favor.

603
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:36,139
If you want, I can make it happen.

604
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:37,707
You'd start in two weeks.

605
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:39,242
T-Two weeks?

606
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,844
Uh... Uh, can I think
about this overnight?

607
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:43,346
Yeah, of course.

608
00:22:43,394 --> 00:22:44,914
But there's no guarantee

609
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:47,016
you'll get a better opportunity,
if you pass this up.

610
00:22:48,733 --> 00:22:50,689
Uh, more wine?

611
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:53,056
No, I am... good.

612
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:55,483
And the food was to your satisfaction?

613
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,616
- It was great.
- Excellent.

614
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:04,477
This <i>is</i> weird, isn't it?

615
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:05,812
No.

616
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,293
- Yes.
- Yes.

617
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:08,905
Yes, it's weird.

618
00:23:08,953 --> 00:23:10,325
You know what? I-I
got some advice today,

619
00:23:10,374 --> 00:23:11,521
from a...

620
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:13,710
Sort of a relationship expert,

621
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,912
and I think we should try it.

622
00:23:16,084 --> 00:23:17,332
- Okay?
- Okay.

623
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,335
I'm gonna tell you
- exactly what I'm thinking.

624
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,616
- No.
- Yeah.

625
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:22,118
- Is that even possible?
- I'm...

626
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,020
W-Well, here it goes.
I'm gonna give it a try.

627
00:23:24,068 --> 00:23:25,506
Okay.

628
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,208
When we were together...

629
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:30,934
It was so...

630
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:32,330
Easy.

631
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,960
It was so good.

632
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:36,586
And now, here we are, 20 years later,

633
00:23:36,635 --> 00:23:37,996
and I'm...

634
00:23:38,624 --> 00:23:40,450
Worried that maybe I'm trying to

635
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:42,200
recapture something that

636
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:44,407
could potentially
already be gone forever.

637
00:23:44,455 --> 00:23:45,613
Does that sound crazy?

638
00:23:45,662 --> 00:23:47,168
No. I mean, I-I...

639
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:49,530
- Feel the same way.
- Okay.

640
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:52,606
Because I really like you, Grace.

641
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:54,090
I like having you as my friend.

642
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:56,985
I really like having you in my life,

643
00:23:57,034 --> 00:23:58,921
and I am terrified of
screwing that up again.

644
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:02,067
Is this...

645
00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:05,598
A mistake, trying to open this door?

646
00:24:05,843 --> 00:24:07,296
I don't know.

647
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:09,419
I mean, maybe.

648
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:11,381
But, um...

649
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:12,935
But what?

650
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,106
I really...

651
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,762
Want you to kiss me right now.

652
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,205
What was that?

653
00:24:35,967 --> 00:24:38,490
Someone just stole my inheritance.

654
00:24:39,027 --> 00:24:40,847
Shouldn't you call it in or something?

655
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,418
No.

656
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:44,562
Pretty sure I know who did it.

657
00:24:50,414 --> 00:24:51,513
Yeah, I've been here all night.

658
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:54,184
What a completely natural way
to answer a door.

659
00:24:54,308 --> 00:24:55,461
Oh. Hey, John.

660
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,630
Hi, Chastity.

661
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:58,388
- You know her?
- Yeah. Long story.

662
00:24:58,436 --> 00:25:00,023
Chastity, have you been
with Pete all night?

663
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:01,558
- Yes.
- Did you at any point in time

664
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:02,926
- witness him stealing a car?
- Oh, yeah.

665
00:25:02,974 --> 00:25:04,394
- I for sure saw him do that.
- Mm.

666
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:05,780
I don't lie to a cop for a guy

667
00:25:05,829 --> 00:25:07,262
until at least the third date.

668
00:25:09,947 --> 00:25:12,068
Why don't you and I go for a walk?

669
00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:14,297
O... kay. Yeah.

670
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:16,119
Thank you.

671
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:19,206
So, you gonna arrest me now?

672
00:25:19,255 --> 00:25:20,942
No. We have to talk.

673
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,479
- What? There's nothing to talk about.
- Our dad is dead,

674
00:25:23,527 --> 00:25:24,914
and I don't know what to do with that,

675
00:25:24,962 --> 00:25:26,549
and I got a feeling you don't either,

676
00:25:26,597 --> 00:25:28,325
but maybe together,

677
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:29,851
we could figure something out.

678
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,028
Alright, maybe that could help.

679
00:25:31,077 --> 00:25:32,106
- You know?
- Yes.

680
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,795
- My head is spinning around right now.
- Exactly.

681
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:35,886
And if you're anything like me,
you've got to be wondering,

682
00:25:35,935 --> 00:25:37,837
why would he leave this car to me?

683
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,433
Yeah, I mean, you know...

684
00:25:40,921 --> 00:25:43,593
We did work on it every day
after school, you know?

685
00:25:43,804 --> 00:25:45,935
He would save up money
and try and get all the parts,

686
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:47,303
slowly build it up.

687
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:49,106
I mean, it took four years
to build the whole car

688
00:25:49,155 --> 00:25:50,974
and then two to get it
to look like this.

689
00:25:51,394 --> 00:25:53,520
At least you had those moments
with him, you know?

690
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:55,111
It's more than I got.

691
00:25:55,396 --> 00:25:56,734
Yeah.

692
00:25:57,345 --> 00:25:59,955
I'm sorry about that. I, um...

693
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:03,255
I think maybe he was
a little over-the-top

694
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:04,724
and overcompensated with me

695
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:07,123
because of how he bolted out on you.

696
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:08,882
It wasn't all good, though, you know?

697
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:11,260
Like, he came to my games,
but, like, he drank a lot,

698
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:12,996
and by the seventh inning,
he was, like, trashed

699
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:14,787
and embarrassed me
in front of my friends.

700
00:26:14,836 --> 00:26:17,290
- You know?
- Doesn't sound very fun.

701
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:20,135
He gave me my first beer when I was 13

702
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:22,372
and then my first joint when I was 15.

703
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,214
So, I turned out great.

704
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:28,346
I grew up thinking
I did something wrong.

705
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:31,354
You know, if he loved me,
he wouldn't have left, right?

706
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:35,418
I'd stay up late at night,
listening to my mom,

707
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:37,520
cry herself to sleep,
coming up with crazy plans

708
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:38,850
how I was gonna track him down

709
00:26:38,899 --> 00:26:40,765
and, I guess, win him back?

710
00:26:40,814 --> 00:26:42,537
But now I'm thinking...

711
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,137
I dodged a bullet.

712
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,993
You dodged a huge bullet.

713
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:47,800
Yeah.

714
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:49,928
Still love him, though.

715
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:52,483
- Is that weird?
- No, that's not weird.

716
00:26:52,532 --> 00:26:54,064
It's human.

717
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:58,241
You know what? You should have the car.

718
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,009
- What?
- Yeah, man, it's what he wants.

719
00:27:00,057 --> 00:27:01,297
We should honor it, right?

720
00:27:01,346 --> 00:27:02,493
- Are you sure about this?
- Plus,

721
00:27:02,542 --> 00:27:03,658
I know I'm nuts and everything,

722
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:04,873
but I'll figure it out you know,

723
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:06,707
maybe me giving you this is, uh...

724
00:27:07,151 --> 00:27:08,992
My closure, or whatever they call it.

725
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,101
I don't know if it's what Dad intended,

726
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:14,268
but by leaving me the car,

727
00:27:14,316 --> 00:27:16,104
he actually connected me to you,

728
00:27:16,152 --> 00:27:17,640
- so...
- Oh.

729
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:22,275
- Stay in touch, Pete.
- Yeah.

730
00:27:22,517 --> 00:27:23,874
Just come... come visit.

731
00:27:23,923 --> 00:27:25,826
You can make sure she's running right.

732
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,178
Deal.

733
00:27:28,338 --> 00:27:29,500
Oh.

734
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:31,236
I have something for you.

735
00:27:31,447 --> 00:27:32,977
Come on. I...

736
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:35,323
Come on.

737
00:27:45,114 --> 00:27:46,667
That's not...

738
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,835
I figured, you know, maybe...

739
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:50,284
Pop the lid.
I figured, maybe, you know...

740
00:27:50,332 --> 00:27:51,791
- Oh, you really don't have to...
- Hey, man.

741
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:54,368
It's our dad.
You deserve to have half, right?

742
00:27:54,884 --> 00:27:55,977
Uh...

743
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:58,312
Look at that. He's a chunky guy.

744
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,414
- Yeah.
- Get a lot of that.

745
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:00,891
Alright.

746
00:28:01,357 --> 00:28:03,283
- Got some more beer.
- Oh, that's right.

747
00:28:03,332 --> 00:28:04,517
Hey, do you, uh...

748
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:06,154
Do you wanna come in for a-a nightcap?

749
00:28:06,202 --> 00:28:08,089
I'm gonna braid her hair
and watch a-a fight.

750
00:28:08,137 --> 00:28:10,158
Very sweet. We really do have to go.

751
00:28:10,206 --> 00:28:12,160
- I have to be at the hospital early.
- So early.

752
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,319
- Oh.
- Cool, cool.

753
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:14,879
Okay, well, it was
very nice meeting you.

754
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:16,048
And, uh...

755
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:19,000
- Cheers.
- Do we... Do we hug?

756
00:28:19,048 --> 00:28:20,435
- Yeah. Hell yeah.
- Alright.

757
00:28:20,735 --> 00:28:22,136
Thanks for not arresting me.

758
00:28:22,184 --> 00:28:23,771
Yeah. Stay out of trouble.

759
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,249
I will.

760
00:28:28,272 --> 00:28:30,960
Aww. I like him.

761
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,957
- Really?
- Yeah.

762
00:28:33,251 --> 00:28:35,123
I just can't believe I have a brother.

763
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:37,092
Half!

764
00:28:37,735 --> 00:28:39,187
We're half-brothers.

765
00:28:39,332 --> 00:28:40,495
Sorry, the walls are thin.

766
00:28:40,546 --> 00:28:43,023
Brother.

767
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:47,528
So, um... I guess...

768
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:49,630
We're driving ourselves home.

769
00:28:49,678 --> 00:28:50,836
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

770
00:28:50,885 --> 00:28:53,079
Not exactly how I pictured the evening.

771
00:28:55,217 --> 00:28:57,138
I'm sorry for spoiling our date.

772
00:28:57,248 --> 00:28:58,821
You kidding me?

773
00:28:59,255 --> 00:29:02,210
I mean, this goes down in
the unforgettable column.

774
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:04,008
Well, um...

775
00:29:04,441 --> 00:29:07,071
Lest we forget,
before all this happened...

776
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,560
- Mm-hmm.
- ...I think we were interrupted.

777
00:29:08,684 --> 00:29:10,051
I think we were right about...

778
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:12,901
- Mm.
- ...here.

779
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:25,147
- What's in the bucket?
- Half my dad.

780
00:29:26,003 --> 00:29:28,024
Oh.

781
00:29:28,174 --> 00:29:31,242
Like I said... unforgettable.

782
00:29:41,477 --> 00:29:43,384
See you soon.

783
00:29:43,486 --> 00:29:44,836
Yes, you will.

784
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,254
Bye.

785
00:30:26,435 --> 00:30:27,506
Hey, Marquel.

786
00:30:27,555 --> 00:30:28,763
Can we talk for a minute?

787
00:30:28,857 --> 00:30:30,419
Unless you gotta get permission first.

788
00:30:30,726 --> 00:30:31,979
Nah, man. I'm good.

789
00:30:34,684 --> 00:30:36,658
You here to threaten me,
Officer Bradford?

790
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:38,525
"Stay away from Nevin or else"?

791
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:40,342
No. We both know you don't scare.

792
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:41,979
So, what? You here to play
to my better angel?

793
00:30:42,028 --> 00:30:43,107
Yeah, something like that.

794
00:30:43,156 --> 00:30:44,732
See, here I thought
you were a hard case,

795
00:30:44,797 --> 00:30:46,918
the man who put Keon in Pelican Bay.

796
00:30:47,661 --> 00:30:49,121
Nevin did his time.

797
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:50,857
He gave your crew a decade of his life.

798
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:52,460
Took the fall like a good soldier.

799
00:30:52,808 --> 00:30:53,894
Let him walk away.

800
00:30:53,943 --> 00:30:55,607
And what's that do for my rep?

801
00:30:55,828 --> 00:30:56,917
Lettin' people slide?

802
00:30:56,966 --> 00:30:59,544
"Reputation is an idle
and most false imposition,"

803
00:30:59,593 --> 00:31:00,912
"oft got without merit,"

804
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:02,448
"and lost without deserving."

805
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:04,122
You have lost no reputation at all

806
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:07,059
"unless you repute yourself
such a loser."

807
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:09,663
"Othello."

808
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:11,868
That was a nice pull,

809
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:13,587
but Shakespeare didn't know nothing

810
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:15,876
about running a gang
in the 21st century.

811
00:31:15,938 --> 00:31:17,825
You don't want to go down this road.

812
00:31:18,006 --> 00:31:19,323
Trust me.

813
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:21,548
Ain't no off-ramp here, Bradford.

814
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:24,194
See, I got plans for Nevin.

815
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:26,634
There's nothing you can do to stop 'em.

816
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:31,478
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

817
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,240
We made our play, and we failed.

818
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:35,776
Wow, I never thought I'd

819
00:31:35,825 --> 00:31:37,118
see you give up that easily.

820
00:31:37,338 --> 00:31:39,492
You got a path to victory, Boot,
I'm all ears.

821
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:41,261
No, I don't, but you're the king

822
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,931
of subversive tests and tricks.

823
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,251
There's got to be some way to win

824
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:46,701
by coming at this sideways.

825
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:52,762
Harper, Nolan.

826
00:31:53,273 --> 00:31:55,305
So,
Rampart picked up that scratch-off guy,

827
00:31:55,354 --> 00:31:56,484
from the strip club video.

828
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:57,536
Tucker Novak?

829
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:59,044
Is that the guy you put a BOLO out on?

830
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:00,770
- Yes, sir.
- Then, yes.

831
00:32:00,955 --> 00:32:02,538
He's in Cell 3.

832
00:32:02,924 --> 00:32:04,193
- I'm innocent.
- Of what?

833
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:05,824
Of whatever y'all
about to accuse me of.

834
00:32:05,873 --> 00:32:08,577
You went to the Red Angel
strip club two nights ago.

835
00:32:08,914 --> 00:32:10,228
Nope.

836
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:12,734
- Can I have that?
- No.

837
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:14,945
You stole those tickets
from the liquor store on Pico,

838
00:32:14,994 --> 00:32:16,468
and then you killed the owner.

839
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,281
Whoa! I had nothing to do with that.

840
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:19,843
And I sure as hell didn't kill anybody.

841
00:32:19,891 --> 00:32:21,357
Then who did?

842
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,947
I want diplomatic immunity.

843
00:32:24,257 --> 00:32:26,049
Yeah, see, my father...
He was born in Spain,

844
00:32:26,097 --> 00:32:29,162
and they're members of NATO... I think.

845
00:32:29,792 --> 00:32:32,027
So... Yeah. I want diplomatic immunity.

846
00:32:33,716 --> 00:32:35,870
Okay. You got it.

847
00:32:35,978 --> 00:32:37,234
- Wait. Really?
- Mm-hmm.

848
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,729
Spanish father means you are solid.

849
00:32:38,777 --> 00:32:40,564
Awesome. Alright, check this out.

850
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:42,896
My boy Colt gave me
a call the other day,

851
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:45,802
said he needed help scratching
off 500 lottery tickets.

852
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:47,838
But, hey, he didn't mention
no murdered woman.

853
00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:49,673
And he just let you keep the winners?

854
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:52,175
I mean, only the small ones,
like I gave that stripper.

855
00:32:52,468 --> 00:32:53,679
No, he kept the big one.

856
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:55,786
The big Kahuna, worth 250 grand.

857
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:57,420
- And where can we find Colt?
- I don't know.

858
00:32:57,469 --> 00:32:58,822
He told his roommates he was moving out

859
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,359
once he scratched off the big winner,

860
00:33:00,408 --> 00:33:01,703
and last I heard of him,

861
00:33:01,752 --> 00:33:03,187
he was still trying
to cash in the ticket.

862
00:33:03,275 --> 00:33:05,823
Lottery doesn't pay out prizes
that size at convenience stores.

863
00:33:05,872 --> 00:33:07,993
Either you have to mail it in
or go up to Sacramento.

864
00:33:08,063 --> 00:33:10,518
I'll call Sacramento PD, have
them sit on the lottery office.

865
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:11,687
Uh, what about me?

866
00:33:11,736 --> 00:33:13,963
Uh, you're under arrest for
accessory after the fact.

867
00:33:14,021 --> 00:33:15,875
But what about my immunity?

868
00:33:16,407 --> 00:33:18,141
So, bad news.

869
00:33:19,945 --> 00:33:21,773
Wesley.

870
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,101
You'll never believe...

871
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,359
I met the most fascinating
people in here last night.

872
00:33:25,408 --> 00:33:26,795
Uh-huh.

873
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,171
Lawrence, give us a minute.

874
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,141
Well, we're discussing
my legal strategy, dear.

875
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:31,628
He does DUIs for rich kids,

876
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,997
which is why you spent
the night in jail.

877
00:33:33,051 --> 00:33:34,797
This is a criminal matter.

878
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,368
You need a criminal lawyer.

879
00:33:37,703 --> 00:33:39,504
Okay, thanks, Lawrence.

880
00:33:44,585 --> 00:33:47,471
I know why you want
to protect Christian,

881
00:33:47,702 --> 00:33:50,241
but you do not understand
who he really is.

882
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:52,049
I ran a background search.

883
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:55,354
He's been to prison for armed robbery,

884
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:56,546
and the gun he gave you...

885
00:33:56,595 --> 00:33:58,127
He used it in a crime after he got out.

886
00:33:58,176 --> 00:33:59,472
He shot someone.

887
00:33:59,703 --> 00:34:01,074
They almost died.

888
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,085
God, I had no idea.

889
00:34:03,134 --> 00:34:05,055
He took advantage of you,

890
00:34:05,237 --> 00:34:07,242
but you will be charged in his crime

891
00:34:07,291 --> 00:34:10,101
unless you tell Angela
that he gave you the gun,

892
00:34:10,211 --> 00:34:12,052
so that she can go arrest him.

893
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,111
Christian Roberts,
we need to talk to you.

894
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:21,231
Damn. I was really hoping
he wouldn't run.

895
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,067
Told you not to eat that meatball sub.

896
00:34:49,257 --> 00:34:50,526
Where'd he go?

897
00:34:50,638 --> 00:34:51,973
I don't know.

898
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,430
Why are you wet?

899
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:55,033
I don't want to talk about it.

900
00:34:55,454 --> 00:34:57,975
7-Adam-07, send additional
units to our location.

901
00:34:58,023 --> 00:34:59,877
- Foot pursuit... lost visual.
- Wait! Wait, wait!

902
00:35:03,028 --> 00:35:05,073
- Get on your stomach.
- Dispatch, cancel request.

903
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,565
- Suspect in custody, Code 4.
- Hands behind your back.

904
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,657
Nolan.

905
00:35:10,706 --> 00:35:11,737
Colt Henry,

906
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:13,627
he just tried to cash
in a stolen scratch-off

907
00:35:13,676 --> 00:35:15,597
at a store across from Union Station.

908
00:35:15,893 --> 00:35:17,572
He must be trying to grab
a train to Sacramento.

909
00:35:17,621 --> 00:35:19,826
- Feel like some overtime?
- Hell yeah.

910
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,564
- Check the board. Where is it?
- There.

911
00:35:23,612 --> 00:35:25,232
Train to Sacramento, platform three.

912
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,267
Okay, that is in 20 minutes.

913
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:29,736
- Let's split up.
- Hey, hey, listen.

914
00:35:29,784 --> 00:35:31,672
So far, this case has been
strippers and idiots,

915
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,828
but this guy...

916
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:34,533
He killed a woman in cold blood.

917
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:36,223
- Don't lose sight of that.
- I won't.

918
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,119
<i>Attention, please.</i>

919
00:35:41,168 --> 00:35:44,751
<i>This is the last call for
Amtrak Pacific Surfliner,</i>

920
00:35:44,799 --> 00:35:48,922
<i>train number 579,
en route to San Diego.</i>

921
00:35:52,755 --> 00:35:54,242
<i>I went to the far end of the concourse.</i>

922
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:55,891
<i>No sign of Colt.</i>

923
00:35:56,978 --> 00:36:00,767
<i>Passengers for Amtrak
Pacific Surfliner number 579,</i>

924
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:02,870
<i>please proceed to track one.</i>

925
00:36:03,072 --> 00:36:06,740
Police. Turn around very slowly.

926
00:36:19,868 --> 00:36:22,402
- Move, move, move.
- He's got a gun!

927
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,549
He's got a gun!

928
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,917
Move.

929
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:38,771
Where is he?

930
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:40,250
- I don't know. Did you see him?
- No.

931
00:36:42,315 --> 00:36:43,644
Someone help me!

932
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:45,338
Go. Go.

933
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,039
Back up.

934
00:36:58,096 --> 00:36:59,435
Don't do this.

935
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:04,363
- Get back, lady.
- Not gonna happen.

936
00:37:04,411 --> 00:37:05,315
Show me your hands,

937
00:37:05,364 --> 00:37:06,447
and they better be empty.

938
00:37:06,496 --> 00:37:07,921
I didn't mean to kill that woman.

939
00:37:08,256 --> 00:37:09,486
She grabbed for my gun.

940
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:10,926
Why'd she do that?

941
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:12,629
There was only a few hundred
in the register.

942
00:37:12,678 --> 00:37:14,698
There's nothing we can do
about that now,

943
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:17,350
but you can control, what happens next.

944
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:20,331
My whole life, I never won anything.

945
00:37:20,426 --> 00:37:22,143
But I got that big ticket now,

946
00:37:22,215 --> 00:37:23,315
and I want to cash it in.

947
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:24,424
It's worthless, Colt.

948
00:37:24,473 --> 00:37:26,322
Just like the one you tried
to cash in across the street.

949
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,593
They were all cancelled,

950
00:37:27,642 --> 00:37:29,550
the moment they were reported stolen.

951
00:37:30,317 --> 00:37:32,659
This is... It's not fair.

952
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:35,046
I never won anything in my life.

953
00:37:37,544 --> 00:37:38,847
But I won that.

954
00:37:38,913 --> 00:37:40,416
You... You can't take
that away from me.

955
00:37:40,465 --> 00:37:42,565
The only thing you
are winning is a body bag

956
00:37:42,614 --> 00:37:43,829
if you don't give up right now.

957
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:45,325
You think I care?

958
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,469
I'm looking at life in prison.

959
00:37:47,811 --> 00:37:48,924
So...

960
00:37:49,322 --> 00:37:51,484
I'm calling the shots here.

961
00:37:52,025 --> 00:37:54,680
So, turn around and walk away.

962
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:56,849
Right now.

963
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,925
- Or else...
- Or else what?!

964
00:37:59,956 --> 00:38:03,076
Your last act in life is
gonna be murdering a child?

965
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:05,239
The world doesn't
owe you anything, Colt.

966
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:07,757
Not a winning lottery ticket,
not a happy childhood.

967
00:38:07,806 --> 00:38:08,926
Nothing.

968
00:38:08,975 --> 00:38:10,595
We all got to do the best
with what we got,

969
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:12,606
and for you, right now,

970
00:38:12,696 --> 00:38:13,996
that means giving up

971
00:38:14,045 --> 00:38:15,266
and getting on the ground.

972
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:30,979
O-Okay.

973
00:38:32,514 --> 00:38:35,274
I'm pulling my hand out.

974
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,189
I let go of the gun.

975
00:38:38,558 --> 00:38:39,660
It's...

976
00:38:39,756 --> 00:38:41,368
D-Don't shoot me.

977
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,386
Okay, okay.

978
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:47,634
Okay, okay.

979
00:38:47,683 --> 00:38:49,800
Okay. Oh.

980
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,842
Suspect in custody. Code 4.

981
00:39:08,011 --> 00:39:10,293
Thank you.

982
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:16,158
I handled your father's
leaving very badly,

983
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:17,690
and his death,

984
00:39:17,738 --> 00:39:19,158
and I've spent the past few years

985
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:20,993
just feeling sorry for myself.

986
00:39:21,041 --> 00:39:22,206
I'm...

987
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:23,707
Look, it's my fault, too,

988
00:39:23,756 --> 00:39:25,566
for not being around more.

989
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,001
- I've been a little selfish.
- A little?

990
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:31,876
Sorry.

991
00:39:31,925 --> 00:39:33,894
Look, I promise to try harder to...

992
00:39:34,686 --> 00:39:36,235
Get over myself,

993
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:37,777
be there for you.

994
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:39,245
And the good news is

995
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,080
the DA's not pressing charges
against you,

996
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,451
so we can all use this as, um...

997
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:45,542
A learning experience.

998
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,794
Genius move, making Nevin's

999
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:57,173
the go-to donut shop for the LAPD.

1000
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,812
Yeah, Marquel wouldn't dare
launder money here now.

1001
00:40:01,415 --> 00:40:04,564
North Hollywood's lucky to have
a sergeant like you coming in.

1002
00:40:05,093 --> 00:40:06,698
Actually, I, uh...

1003
00:40:07,019 --> 00:40:09,269
I told Grey that I'm not
interested in moving up,

1004
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:10,943
just yet.

1005
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,212
What, are you holding out for Malibu?

1006
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:15,915
Tim Bradford finishes what he starts.

1007
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,298
I haven't finished training you yet.

1008
00:40:20,644 --> 00:40:23,079
No. You haven't.

1009
00:40:24,447 --> 00:40:26,791
You are gonna move up at
some point, though, right?

1010
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,794
Because I put a lot of time
into those books on tape.

1011
00:40:31,445 --> 00:40:32,832
Yeah.

1012
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,400
♪ -

1013
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:42,174
"I had a great time last night!"

1014
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:47,580
No exclamation point.

1015
00:40:47,629 --> 00:40:49,257
"Great time last night."

1016
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:53,124
"Let's do it again... soon."

1017
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,463
"Let's do it again soon?"

1018
00:40:55,712 --> 00:40:57,407
"Let's do it again soon."

1019
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,169
Why don't people just call anymore?

1020
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:04,413
Hey. I was...

1021
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,831
I-I was just trying to text you.

1022
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:06,999
Trying?

1023
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,035
Well, uh, there's an art to it.

1024
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:10,636
<i>I'm just messing with you.</i>

1025
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:12,085
I just spent the last half-hour

1026
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:13,535
rewriting a text to you,
and then I just...

1027
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:14,895
You know, I, um...

1028
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:16,342
I figured that I'd just call.

1029
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,653
Well, I'm glad you did.

1030
00:41:19,631 --> 00:41:20,731
What was that?

1031
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,014
Uh, that was the sound

1032
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,481
of my inheritance, being stolen again.

1033
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,424
- Can I call you right back?
- Sure.

1034
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,447
Tell Pete I said hi.

1035
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:30,022
Will do.

1036
00:41:33,087 --> 00:41:34,295
<i>Yo.</i>

1037
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:36,362
I thought you said you
needed me to have the car

1038
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,963
so you could have closure.

1039
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:40,666
Yeah, no, I-I don't really
believe in closure.

1040
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:42,984
Plus, Chastity loves the car.

1041
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:45,237
- Hi, John.
<i>- Hi, Chastity.</i>

1042
00:41:45,779 --> 00:41:47,606
So, Pete, listen,

1043
00:41:47,655 --> 00:41:50,934
I-I know you don't believe in closure,

1044
00:41:50,983 --> 00:41:54,146
but I do, and you've given me some...

1045
00:41:54,322 --> 00:41:56,345
Closure I never thought I would have.

1046
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:58,150
So thank you.

1047
00:41:58,357 --> 00:41:59,744
Anytime, man.

1048
00:41:59,793 --> 00:42:01,220
Hey, you think you could do me a favor

1049
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,582
and maybe mail me the keys?

1050
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:04,564
'Cause I had to hot-wire
this in your driveway.

1051
00:42:04,702 --> 00:42:05,980
<i>Sure thing.</i>

1052
00:42:06,152 --> 00:42:08,060
Stay safe, Pete. Keep in touch.

1053
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,223
You got it.

1054
00:42:09,272 --> 00:42:11,299
Hey, man,
having a brother cop is pretty sick.

1055
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:13,232
<i>That means a-a lot to me, Pete.</i>

1056
00:42:13,692 --> 00:42:15,067
Even from you.
