00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,400
Previously on "The Rookie"...
Bianca, right? Heroin?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,810
You're gonna become
an informant.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,740
I've been instructing
Officer West about how patrol

4
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,140
can leverage
lower-level criminals.

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,480
Perhaps earn some goodwill
prior to your detectives exam?

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,400
What's wrong?
Jason is in ICU.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,810
Think this will
move you down the list?

8
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,100
Are you kidding?
I'm off the list.

9
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,640
Ripper.

10
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,600
You used to hang with Eva.
Yeah, for a minute.

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,520
Because she stole from me.
We got to get in there.

12
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,730
Eva already
caught her beating.

13
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,520
But since you're feeling
so generous,

14
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,980
I do have a job
you could help with.

15
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:25,690
Whoa!
That's my old man.

16
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,100
Walk away.
Make me.

17
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,100
See you around.

18
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,850
Mr. Singer.
Step out, please.

19
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,980
Releasing me so soon?

20
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,770
I was just
getting comfortable.

21
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,140
Nope.
It's lineup time.

22
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,400
But don't worry.

23
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,900
Once you get ID'd,
you'll have plenty of time

24
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,060
to get comfortable
in prison.

25
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,060
Let's go.

26
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,060

Officer Chen,
release the lineup.

52
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,520
You were saying something
about a "long-term" stay?

53
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:40,810
She ID you?

54
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,900
Nope. Hit 'em hard,
drive away fast.

55
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,480

Yeah.

Nice.
Wait! That's entrapment!

62
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,270
Uh, you're wrong.

63
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,600
There's no legal
expectation of privacy
within a police station.

64
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,140
Anything you say here

Oh. So only nine more hours
of being bored out of my mind.

72
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,520
Pass.

73
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,730
I like it.

74
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,140
I think it's subtle

75
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,810
and nuanced.

76
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,980
I suppose you'd rather
watch "Action Heist"?

77
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,730
Any day.

78
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,730
Okay, they have a shark attack
on an elevator, Sterling.

79
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,600
And it was awesome.

80
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,480
You know what? It doesn't
even matter what we watch,

81
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,600
because I won't be
looking at the screen anyway.

82
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,560
Sugarfish?
You guys are the best!
W--

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,060
Come on, let me in!
Let me in!
Uh...

84
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,350
I thought you were hanging out
with Rachel tonight.

85
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,140
Yeah, no.

86
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,310
I canceled because tonight is
a new episode of "Action Heist."

87
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,190
Bam!

88
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,440
Previously on "Action Heist"...

89
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,060
Lastly, the brass
wants us to increase

90
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,270
our social media presence
within the community.

91
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,980
We're cops,
not influencers.

92
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,140
Like it or not,
Officer Bradford, you're both.

93
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,350
A strong relationship with
the public makes us all safer.

94
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,020
So let's show them
we're people, too.

95
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,270
Get out there,
take a few selfies.

96
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,520
Yes, Officer Nolan?

97
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,690
Back in Foxburg,
I knew most of the cops by name.

98
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,020
Because there were
four of them.

99
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,810
Five, but the number
didn't matter.

100
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,270
It's just that they spent
most of their time on foot.

101
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,230
I mean, how are we supposed
to take a selfie with someone

102
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,810
when we're trapped in our shop
most of the day?

103
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,480
That's a good point.

104
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,270
We do spend too much time
locked inside our shops.

105
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,060
New plan.

106
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,230
Everyone spends the morning
on foot patrol.

107
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,850
Good one, Officer Nolan.

108
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,770
I can tell
what you're thinking.
Doubt it.

109
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,060
You're working out
how to kill me

110
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,640
without your body cam
catching it.

111
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,480
Yeah, actually,
that is what I was thinking.

112
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,310
Mommy! Policeman!

113
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,440
Hi, there, buddy.
What's your name?

114
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,140
Sam.
Is that a real gun?

115
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,600
It sure is.

116
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,770
Can I hold it?
Oh!

117
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,770
No. That's, uh --
That's against the rules.

118
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,350
But I do have some stickers
here for you.

119
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,640
Thanks!
You bet, buddy.
Have a good day.

120
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,940
See? That was great!

121
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,770
There are four felonies an hour
in Los Angeles.

122
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,190
But, no,
that was a good use of time.

123
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,230
I've got no problem
with community engagement.

124
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,560
Citizens play a vital role
in policing.

125
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,730
The more they like us,
the more they help us.

126
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,730
That's a surprisingly
enlightened attitude.

127
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,640
Yo -- Yo, officers.
Uh, I got a legal question.

128
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,020
Sorry, we're not real cops.
We're extras.

129
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,480
There's a movie shoot
down the street.

130
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,770
Oh.

131
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,600
Cool. Thanks.

132
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,020
What am I? Google?
Do your own research.

133
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,020
Look, don't get me wrong.

134
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,270
I love hanging out with Lucy,
and I know she's, like,

135
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,100
slow-rolling back
to the dating scene, but...

136
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,310
I miss my boyfriend.

137
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,730
So tell her that.
I can't.

138
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,940
She's still in,
like, a delicate place.

139
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,440
Then forget about
having any alone time

140
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,980
in the foreseeable future.

141
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,230
7-Adam-07, attaching
you to a possible 187.

142
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,690
Husband arrived home to find
wife bleeding and unresponsive.

143
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:05,020

Thank God.

144
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,940
7-Adam-07,
show us responding.

145
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,640
How much did you pay Dispatch
to give us the first call?

146
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,140
A bottle of
Wesley's fancy wine.

147
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,640
So worth it.

148
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,440
Police!

149
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,810
Police officers!
Is there anyone here?

150
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,400
Jackson.

151
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Sir?

152
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,810
I came home
to surprise her.

153
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,230
Who would've done this?

154
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,440
7-Adam-07,
Code 4 at our location.

155
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,940
Copy. Detectives are
on their way.

156
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,900
Sir, you have to
let her go and come with us.

157
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,940
Come on.

158
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,310
What do we got?
Watch him.

159
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,100
Detective Calderon,
we just got here. We have --

160
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,690
What's he doing here?

161
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,350
This is a crime scene.
He's a suspect.

162
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,770
Yes, ma'am.
We were just about --

163
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,310
Forget it.
I'll deal with him.

164
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,850
You two,
go and canvass the neighbors.

165
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,730
What's her problem?

166
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:08,520
I have no idea.

167
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,350
Say "Waste
of Police Resources."

168
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,850
Cheese!

169
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:16,480
Thank you, sir. We'll be sure
to tag you in the post.

170
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,480
You know,
attitude is everything.

171
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,940
Drug deal.

172
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,400
Without the shop,
there's no way

173
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,140
we can roll up on them
without them seeing us.

174
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,600
Wrong.

175
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,230
Put your hand
over your collar, like this.

176
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,520
You're saying
if we cover our badges,

177
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,690
they're not
gonna notice us?

178
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,940
Yep. Watch.

179
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,770
Hi, there!

180
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,350
Cops!

181
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,350
Bianca?

182
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,520
John.

183
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,270
I can explain.

184
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,690
You just got
your 30-day chip.

185
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,770
I know. I know.

186
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,730
But I'm making
minimum wage.

187
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,770
My mom's sick,
and the medication's expensive.

188
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,810
That's rough.
You're under arrest.

189
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,560
Please. I can help,
like last time.

190
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,520
You mean when you bailed out
the window and then you OD'd?

191
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,770
Yeah,
that was such a help.

192
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,940
Hook her up.

193
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,850
Turn around.

194
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,100
It's different now,
okay?

195
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,980
I'm clean.

196
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,850
I know about
a huge score.

197
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,310
A ton of fentanyl.

198
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,230
Don't lie to me, Bianca.

199
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,020
I would never lie to you,
John.

200
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,640
Who's selling
the fentanyl?

201
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,690
Uh, Curtis.

202
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,980
Curtis have a last name?

203
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,980
I don't know it,
but everyone calls him Ripper.

204
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,640
Do you think
Rachel's disappointed

205
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,690
I canceled last night?

206
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,190
Don't know.

207
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,350
Man, I felt bad.

208
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,940
She found this bartender

209
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,440
that tailors cocktails
to your astrological sign.

210
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,730
It sounded cool.
I just --

211
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,310
I was tired,
and I needed a night in.

212
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,520
She gets that, right?

213
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,940
You might find this surprising,
but we don't talk about you.

214
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,190
Ever.
Wow.

215
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,980
Police!

216
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,400
Control, 7-Adam-19.
Requesting an RA unit.

217
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,690
He came out of nowhere!
Palmetto and Mateo.

218
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,690
Head verse vehicle. CT.

219
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,600
Okay, stay still.

220
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,690
Oh, man, I think
it got into an artery.

221
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,980
There's a lot of blood.

222
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,560
Okay.
Aah!

223
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,980
Here.

224
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,600
You can use this scarf and pen
to make a tourniquet.

225
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,690
Thank you.

226
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,190
Place it two inches
above the wound.

227
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:35,980
Okay.

228
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,100
Alright,
the bleeding's stopped.

229
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,980
Am I gonna get a badge
for this?

230
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,640
So...

231
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,190
...been hanging
with Bianca?

232
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,100
Hanging? Well,
I got her into a program.

233
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,770
Kept an eye on her.
Pulled back once she got clean.

234
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,100
Didn't want her
to get confused.

235
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,940
I don't think that worked.

236
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,640
Girl just got arrested,
but she seems more upset

237
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,140
that she disappointed you.

238
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,310
I didn't see that.

239
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,350
I did.

240
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,020
Still, I wonder if she would've
slipped if I'd been around.

241
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,520
Don't do that.

242
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,900
This is on her, not you.

243
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,600
So, you sure this tip
is solid?

244
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,100
I know how badly
you want to get Ripper.

245
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,850
Judge thought so.

246
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,310
Gave us a no-knock warrant
based on Nolan's CI.

247
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,940
Bianca insists Ripper is sitting
on a huge supply of fentanyl.

248
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,810
I didn't know
he was that big of a player.

249
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,100
He didn't used to be.

250
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,480
Looks like he's making a move
for the big time.

251
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,400
You ready, Sergeant?

252
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,270
Alright.
Let's go get this guy.

253
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,480
What the hell?

254
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,350
DEA.

255
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,060
Who's in charge here?

256
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,060
Michael?

257
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,190
Nyla?

258
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,900
I heard you were back on patrol,
but I didn't believe it.

259
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,400
Okay, can we do
this reunion thing

260
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,350
after you tell me why
you just landed in my operation?

261
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,310
Because you're about to
blow my operation.

262
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,060
So I'm shutting you down.

263
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,530
Nine minutes, Lang?

264
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,740
You guys are usually
much faster than that.

265
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,650
Bradford's your TO?

266
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,650
Yeah.
My condolences.

267
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,280
That's what everyone says.

268
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,070
Emmett.

269
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,200
Lucy.

270
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,400
All this over a few boxes
of Marsh Yellows?

271
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,280
Right?
They couldn't get Pim-Pams?

272
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,200
Who made the tourniquet?

273
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,440
I did!

274
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,070
Officer Lucy helped.

275
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,820
Well, excellent work!

276
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,200
Thank you.

277
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,280
Uh...help.

278
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,900
Oh. Right.

279
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,900
In early September,
our sources in Mexico

280
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,360
identified
a shipment of fentanyl

281
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,490
being driven from Michoacán

282
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,400
across the border
into California.

283
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,110
Rather than stopping it,
we decided to follow the drugs,

284
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,900
use the intel we collected

285
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,860
to arrest
the entire smuggling network.

286
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,110
A controlled delivery. That's
what you used to do undercover.

287
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,570
Yes, Agent Banks and I
worked together on them

288
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,240
on the Narcotics Task Force.

289
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,360
Nyla was the most hardcore UC
I've ever seen.

290
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,530
She could lie to God Himself
and get away with it.

291
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:18,200
You don't say.

292
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,740
That's surprising, 'cause
she always tells me the truth.

293
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,150
Right, Detective?
Absolutely, sir.

294
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,700
The truck was ambushed in
the desert outside Ocotillo.

295
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,360
We were monitoring
with satellites.

296
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,940
Seven minutes later,
the entire shipment was gone.

297
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,280
And you think
Ripper stole it.

298
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,530
We don't think it.

299
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,860
We know it.

300
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,240
So, why'd you shut us down?

301
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,740
'Cause the drugs
aren't stored

302
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,530
at the location
that you were about to hit.

303
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,530
Where are they?

304
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,490
You don't know, which is why
you're talking to us right now.

305
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,780
We've been on Ripper
and his crew for two weeks.

306
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,110
They haven't gone
near the fentanyl.

307
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,490
So, what kind of weight
are we talking?

308
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,940
20 kilos, uncut.

309
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,490
Street value --
roughly $10 million.

310
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,360
That is a morgue full of ODs
in the making.

311
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,110
So, what's the plan
to keep it off the street?

312
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,400
Honestly,
we didn't have one,

313
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,320
till we got wind
of your warrant.

314
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,240
You've given us a way in --
your CI.

315
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,700
We can use her to introduce me
as a straw buyer to Ripper.

316
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,200
Uh, all due respect, sir,

317
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,940
I-I don't think
Bianca's ready for that.

318
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,490
Then you can make her ready.

319
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,400
Every hour that goes by
increases the risk

320
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,940
that those drugs
end up on the street.

321
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,200
Detective Calderon.

322
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,940
We're done
with the canvass.

323
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,030
Neighbors report seeing
a suspicious vehicle

324
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,740
speeding down the street
around 11:00 a.m.

325
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,700
Now, the guy on the corner
identified it as a blue sedan.

326
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,280
Said he's never seen it
in the neighborhood before.

327
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,610
And...?

328
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,740
And the timeline
fits the TOD.

329
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,570
Plus, it's a cul-de-sac.

330
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,320
They don't get a lot of random
traffic driving through here.

331
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,200
That's weak,
Officer Lopez,

332
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,150
even if we didn't already
have a prime suspect.

333
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,990
The husband?

334
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:43,570
Patrol has responded to
six domestics at this residence

335
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,360
over the past three years.

336
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,860
Then there's the withdrawal slip
I found in the victim's purse.

337
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,240
Mrs. Cook took $100,000 in cash
from their account

338
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,610
first thing this morning.

339
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,320
My guess is
she was getting ready

340
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,940
to leave her abusive husband,
but he found out,

341
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,650
stopped her in her tracks
permanently.

342
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,200
Where's the money?
Don't know yet.

343
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,030
Husband might have hid it,
or the victim did

344
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,860
before she came home
to get the rest of her stuff.

345
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,490
Either way,
we're done here.

346
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,700
I still think
we should follow up on the car.

347
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,360
Are you the detective here,
Officer Lopez?

348
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,570
No, ma'am.
If I need more scut work,
I'll call you.

349
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:16,030
You sure you're up for this?
Yeah.

350
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,440
Okay, this isn't
just a handoff, Bianca.

351
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,150
You have to look Ripper
in the eye

352
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,990
and make him believe
you have a buyer for the drugs.

353
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,400
I know. I can do it.

354
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,240
Okay. Prove it.

355
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,490
Sell me.

356
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,240
What?

357
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,780
Now.

358
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,940
Okay.

359
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,440
H-Hey, Ripper. I heard
you scored some fentanyl.

360
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,610
Heard from where?

361
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,320
You know.
No, I don't know.

362
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
People.

363
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,070
Anyway, I got you a buyer
out of Chicago.

364
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,360
Kansas City, not Chicago.

365
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,860
What difference
does it make?

366
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,110
Because Kansas City is where
the DEA set up the fake buyer.

367
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,860
I'm sorry.

368
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,280
I'll do better.

369
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,860
I promise
I won't let you down.

370
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,530
Okay, this isn't about me,
Bianca.

371
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,440
One wrong word,
and Ripper will kill you.

372
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,700
I love how much
you care about me.

373
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,030
Stay here.

374
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,360
David, will you watch her
for a minute?

375
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,570
Thank you.

376
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,320
Excuse me, sir.

377
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,740
Do you have a minute?

378
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,700
Sure. Everything good to go
with your CI?

379
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,940
Uh...actually, no.

380
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,530
Bianca's a mess. I think Ripper
will see right through her.

381
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,280
You tell Agent Banks?

382
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,650
Not yet,
but there's more.

383
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,610
Um...uh...

384
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,400
it's become clear to me
that, uh, Bianca feels

385
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
that the concern
I've shown for her

386
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,780
means that
I have feelings for her.

387
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,990
Yeah, yeah,
that is a problem.

388
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,940
And I've tried to maintain
boundaries, but it's...

389
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,200
apparent I've failed.

390
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,110
No, no, no.
It's not your fault.

391
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,940
CIs, by definition,
are in crisis.

392
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,900
They've endured
a series of hardships

393
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,150
and made a lot of bad choices
to end up in this station.

394
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:52,320
Then we come along
and help them back up,

395
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,360
giving them
the first sympathetic ear

396
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,400
that some of them
have ever had.

397
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,820
If you think Bianca's
unprepared, you got to pull her.

398
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,240
I can do that?

399
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,110
She's your CI,
which means it's your call,

400
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,400
even as a rookie.

401
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,070
But know this --

402
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,820
Agent Banks will be pissed.

403
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,740
Agent Banks?

404
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,530
Good.
Let's wire her up.

405
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:16,780
She's not up for this.

406
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,110
Yes, I am.

407
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,030
No. You're not.

408
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,740
As Bianca's handler,
it's my decision

409
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,490
whether to put her
in harm's way,

410
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,280
and I can't allow her
to proceed with this operation.

411
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,280
You can't?

412
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,530
I make one phone call, you'll
never put on that uniform again.

413
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,200
So wire her ass up.

414
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,940
No, sir.

415
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,700
And If you pull your head
out of your ass for a minute,

416
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,030
you'll see that I'm right.

417
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,490
If Ripper thinks for one second
this is a setup,

418
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:42,530
you'll lose your only chance
to intercept those drugs,

419
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,650
and the ODs that will follow --
those will be on your head.

420
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,280
Get her out of here.

421
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,650
Let's go.

422
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,070
Why are you
sending me away?

423
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,650
Because you're confused
about things.

424
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,700
No, I want to help you!
Stop.

425
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,570
I'm your handler,
not your friend.

426
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,400
Then why did you
take me to NA?

427
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,320
Help me find a job?

428
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,900
That's what cops do
with their CIs, alright?

429
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,320
We show a little kindness
to help keep you in line.

430
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,200
Now, I should've been clearer
about that. That's on me.

431
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,070
But you need to get the idea
out of your head

432
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,780
that I have feelings
for you.

433
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,320
Thank you so much.
I'll give these to the nurses.

434
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,400
Oh, she got you good.

435
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,610
Yeah,
that Emily kid's a hustler.
Uh-huh.

436
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,820
I'm handing them out to
my favorite nurses so I
don't have to eat them all.

437
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,780
Oh, man, I do not have
that kind of will power.

438
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,030
I'm gonna eat three boxes
while I binge-watch
"Action Heist" tonight.

439
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,030
Whoa, hold on.
You watch that?

440
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:52,820
Yes.

441
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,570
Man, I love that show!

442
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,030
The second Harry showed up with
that mustache, I knew he was --

443
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,240
He was the evil twin!
Yes!

444
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,820
Yeah, mustache equals evil.
That's Bad Guy 101.

445
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,200
Exactly.

446
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,940
Yeah.
Good work.

447
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,440
Well...

448
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,110
if you like action and heists,
there happens to be

449
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,150
a Rupert Payne marathon
at the Aero.

450
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,530
And I have an extra ticket
for Saturday night,

451
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,570
if you wanna...
come with me.

452
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,280
Cool.

453
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,530
Um...

454
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,530
Actually, Saturday
is bad for me.

455
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,320
But, uh...

456
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,700
thank you for asking.

457
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,030
Of course.

458
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,650
Let's hit it, Boot.

459
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,030
Later, Lang.
Alright, Bradford.

460
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,570
Lucy.

461
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,110
He seems nice.

462
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,200
Sure.

463
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,820
Do you know him well?

464
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,780
Play a little
pick-up basketball together.

465
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,150
Oh.

466
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,400
No.
What?

467
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,650
No. Forget it.
What?!

468
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,610
Your social life
is not my responsibility.

469
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,200
I learned that lesson
the hard way.

470
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,610
You wanna vet Emmett,
you go to somebody else.

471
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,860
It was the right call.

472
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,110
I know.

473
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:02,280
But since your boot
pulled the plug on my way in...

474
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,940
we're gonna need
a new one.

475
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,900
Uh, I don't have any CIs
that fit the bill,

476
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,610
but I can ask Narcotics.

477
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,070
We don't have time
for that.

478
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,990
Ripper could flip the shipment
this afternoon.

479
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:14,030
I need someone
that Ripper knows --

480
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,320
someone who can
lie to God Himself.

481
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,110
Mike.
Come on.

482
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,530
Mi--

483
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,070
You saved my ass before.

484
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,440
I wouldn't ask
if lives weren't at stake.

485
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,360
This isn't months undercover.
It's a quick in-and-out.

486
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,070
Look, even if
I were to say yes,

487
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,400
Ripper knows Crystal
as a junkie.

488
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,110
There's no way he would trust me
to act as a go-between.

489
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,900
True.

490
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,440
You'd need someone to pose as
a link to the Kansas City buyer.

491
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,860
Ideally, Ripper
would already know them.

492
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,440
Nolan!

493
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:51,900
What's up?

494
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,490
We've got a new plan
to get Ripper.

495
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,700
I'm going in as Crystal.

496
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
And you're coming with me.

497
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,280
What are you doing?

498
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,940
I ran that blue car
through the CGIC

499
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,110
and got a bunch of hits.

500
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,110
Look at this.

501
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,200
Lopez.

502
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,860
I hear you've been pulling
robbery files?

503
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,400
Yes, ma'am.

504
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,200
Even though I told you
to stand down.

505
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,940
Yes, ma'am.

506
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,700
Here's the thing,
Nancy Drew.

507
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,990
Your little hunch,
the files you pulled,

508
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,110
the notes you're writing --
all of that is discoverable.

509
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,320
I know you're sleeping
with the enemy,

510
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,570
but I didn't think
you'd be one of them yourself.

511
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,530
Sleeping with the enemy?

512
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,990
This is about Wesley?

513
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,110
Joanna Kelly.

514
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,820
Murdered coming home from school
back in '18.

515
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,440
Took us months for us to crack,
but we had him cold.

516
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,400
And then your boyfriend gets it
tossed on some procedural crap.

517
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,820
If you'd done the work
to make the case bulletproof,

518
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,110
he wouldn't have
been able to.

519
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,610
What did you say?
You heard me.

520
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,610
Hey! Hey!
Let's call it a night, yeah?

521
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,200
Listen to your boot.

522
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,030
There were
three other burglaries

523
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,440
in the same vicinity
as this murder.

524
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,530
At all of them, a blue sedan
was seen leaving the scene.

525
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,280
That's thin.

526
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,280
Except that each victim also
withdrew a large sum of cash

527
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,240
from the same bank
the same day they were robbed.

528
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,030
It's all in here.

529
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:11,820
So, unless you want to get
embarrassed on the stand again,

530
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,440
you should take a look,
Detective.

531
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,740
Well.

532
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,990
Look who it is.

533
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,070
Nice place.

534
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,900
Crown jewel
of my empire.

535
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,280
How's the food?

536
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,570
Oh, it's great, especially
if you hate your colon.

537
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,780
Yeah.

538
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,490
But, uh, bet you got
one of those Michigan stars

539
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,820
for laundering money,
am I right?

540
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,200
Yeah.

541
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,110
You know,
I was surprised you called.

542
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,900
Especially after the way
we left it, you know?

543
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,740
Yeah, no, I get that,
but, um

544
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,650
money trumps a grudge
any day.

545
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,150
Hmm.
And, uh...

546
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:01,820
I got a deal that's gonna
make us both a lot of it.

547
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,900
I don't do deals
with tweakers.

548
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,740
I wouldn't, either.
But that ain't me no more.

549
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,030
Mm.

550
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,650
You see, my old man,
he got me clean.

551
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,400
So now
I'm on the supply side.

552
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,610
So, what, you, uh --
you want a job?

553
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,990
Nah.

554
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,320
Huh.

555
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:22,030
I heard you came across
a big-time load of fentanyl.

556
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,110
You heard?

557
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,700
Right.

558
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,610
Who told you that?

559
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,530
Dude.

560
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,360
It's all over the street.

561
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,530
Hmm.

562
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:44,990
But today
is your lucky day.

563
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,030
Hmm.

564
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,150
Because I got a buyer
for it all.

565
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,070
Mm-hmm. A heavy hitter
outta Kansas City.

566
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,400
Kansas City.

567
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,530
Yeah.

568
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,400
And who's this heavy hitter?
Hmm?

569
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,030
He's my old man's cousin.
Hmm.

570
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,490
They grew up together.
They did time together.

571
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,900
But, yo, he is solid,

572
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,110
and he is eager to
buy everything you have got.

573
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,740
He's eager?

574
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,700
Ohh.

575
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,940
I'll pass.

576
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Throw her out.

577
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,110
Don't be an idiot, yo!
Let's go.

578
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,360
Y-You bit off way more
than you can chew --

579
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,940
ripping off
a damn cartel?!

580
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,530
You trying to move weight

581
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:25,150
you ain't even got the manpower
to step on.

582
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,070
I am trying to put millions
in your pocket

583
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,490
and your problems
in your rearview.

584
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:31,070
But you know what?

585
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,150
Nah, you right.
Throw my ass out.

586
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,400
How do I know
you're for real? Huh?

587
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,240
Let's go meet my old man
in the back.

588
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,700
Just you.

589
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,240
Just me?

590
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,530
Mm-hmm.

591
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,150
Okay.

592
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,240
After you.

593
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,150
You expect me to believe
you got millions,

594
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,150
driving around
in this low-rent ride?

595
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,780
I thought you told me
he was smart.

596
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,200
What's that mean?

597
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,820
You wanna be a cop magnet?
Drive around in a flashy car.

598
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:22,780
You learn that in KC?
Working corners in Brookside?

599
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,990
I look like a Brookside guy
to you? I'm from Blue Parkway.

600
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,700
And before you start
quizzing me on ribs,

601
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,900
it's LC's all the way.

602
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,150
Alright.

603
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,740
Just had to check.

604
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,570
Okay, so,
can we talk numbers now?

605
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:35,780
20 keys uncut.

606
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,570
Selling at 400 per.

607
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,780
Hell no.

608
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,650
Nah, 250.

609
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,110
We're buying your entire load,
so we ain't paying retail.

610
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,530
300.

611
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:46,320
Best and final.

612
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,280
That's a million,
just to prove we're for real.

613
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,320
Alright.

614
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,940
Careful.

615
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,150
Relax, KC.
It's a sample.

616
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,320
But cut that at least five times
before you taste it,

617
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,650
or whoever does will be dead
before they hit the floor.

618
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,070
So, it's a deal.
Maybe.

619
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,400
We still got to do
a little background check

620
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,780
on your man here.

621
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,700
Alright.

622
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,440
Well, you got my number.

623
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,030
But you make us wait too long,
it goes back to 250.

624
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,700
Is this gonna work?

625
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,530
If Banks doesn't screw up
your paper trail.

626
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,820
And if he does?

627
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,440
We pray the body count
doesn't include us.

628
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,200
Hey.

629
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,280
Um, so,
I texted Sterling.

630
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,440
We are going to
binge-watch "The Bachelor"

631
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,320
and eat
all of these cookies.

632
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,650
Yeah, Lucy, look --

633
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,490
No, please. I cannot watch
"The Cardinal" again.

634
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,860
It is so boring.

635
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,110
"A" --
It is subtle and nuanced.

636
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,280
Mm...
But, "B" --

637
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,440
Look, it's not even
about what we watch.

638
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,030
Okay.

639
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,940
Sterling and I
love hanging out with you,

640
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,030
but we really need
our alone time, too.

641
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,820
Oh, my God.
I am the third wheel.

642
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:07,320
Uh, beautiful, talented,
badass third wheel.

643
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,400
I --

644
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,900
Chen.

645
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,700
Grey needs another team
on the DEA op.

646
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,150
You wanna put in
some OT?

647
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,990
Sure. Yeah.
I'm not doing anything.

648
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,320
I'll go get changed.
Alright, let's go.

649
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,900
Hey, Lucy.

650
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,990
We're okay, right?

651
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,240
Yeah. Yeah.

652
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,940
Why wouldn't we be?

653
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,820
Now what?

654
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,030
I went through the file --
all the evidence you gathered.

655
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,740
And it only took
two phone calls

656
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,400
to ID the bank teller

657
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,780
who handled
all the cash withdrawals

658
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,530
for Mrs. Cook
and the other victims.

659
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,070
Which means
you were right.

660
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,860
And I owe you an apology.

661
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,030
Yeah, you do.

662
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,110
You're not gonna be gracious
about this, are you?

663
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,280
Why should I be?
You were out of line.

664
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,360
Fair enough.

665
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,490
But there is a teller
in interrogation.

666
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,900
You think
you got what it takes

667
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,070
to get a confession
out of this guy?

668
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,940
Watch me.

669
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:10,200
Oh!

670
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,150
Finally, someone's gonna
tell me what I'm doing here.

671
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,860
Sorry to keep you,
Mr. Dugan.

672
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,530
We just need your help
with a case we're investigating.

673
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,240
Yeah. Of course.

674
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,400
It's just, you know,
I have someplace to be, so...

675
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,900
I'll try
and move things along.
Great.

676
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,200
Do any of these people
look familiar?

677
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,440
Nope.

678
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,780
They're all customers
at your bank.

679
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,610
Okay.
If you say so.

680
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,570
In fact, they all made
large withdrawals

681
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,860
and got robbed
later that same day.

682
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:36,280
I'm sorry.
W-W-What does this
have to do with me?

683
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,650
I was just hoping
you might have some insight

684
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,070
on your fellow employees.

685
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,280
Oh.

686
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,900
Are any of them
having financial problems?

687
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,700
Uh, Candice is always
stressed about money.

688
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,070
She's moving back in
with her mom.

689
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,860
And Roy drinks. A lot.

690
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,110
What kind of car
do you drive?

691
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,200
What? My car? A Honda.

692
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,280
What color?

693
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,110
I'm sorry,
but I do have to go.

694
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,530
It's --
One last thing.

695
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,320
I understand that you waited on
Mrs. Cook this morning.

696
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,740
That isn't Mrs. Coo--

697
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,400
So, you do know
the victims.

698
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,700
No.

699
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,110
U-Uh, I mean...y-yes.
I-I-I --

700
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,570
Maybe you should sit down,
Mr. Dugan.

701
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,530
I was at the crime scene.

702
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:18,700
It's clear Mrs. Cook fought back
before she was killed.

703
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,780
Are we gonna find marks
under your sleeves?

704
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,360
Can I give you
a little advice, Mr. Dugan?

705
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,610
Sure.

706
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,320
You'll feel better
when you confess.

707
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,030
I have nothing
to confess to.

708
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,240
Okay.

709
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:34,700
Listen to me.

710
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,070
All that stress and fear
you're feeling --

711
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,490
the overwhelming
need to vomit --

712
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,820
that's never gonna go away
until you tell the truth.

713
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,240
So, tell me...

714
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,740
...did you mean
to kill her?

715
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,940
It was an accident.

716
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,610
She surprised me.

717
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:00,030
And -- And -- And I-I --
I didn't want to --

718
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,440
I need you to write that all
down, exactly how it happened.

719
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:13,400
Why hasn't Ripper called
to confirm the meeting yet?

720
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,030
He's doing his homework,

721
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,940
making sure
the story checks out.

722
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,320
...got a lot
on the line here.

723
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,820
I'll tell him
you said so.

724
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,990
What if I blew it?

725
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,860
Okay.

726
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,700
You didn't.
Alright. Good.

727
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,940
Speak of the devil.

728
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,610
Ripper. What's up?

729
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,280
Hey. You and your boys
check out.

730
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,940
Tell me something
I don't know.

731
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,940
Deal's on. Meet me behind
Rock N Roll Ralph's tomorrow.

732
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,990
11:00 a.m.

733
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll be seeing you.

734
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,110
See? Told you he'd call.

735
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,570
Don't get excited yet,
Boot.

736
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,240
We still have a long night
ahead of us,

737
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,110
making sure that
he does not change his mind

738
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:45,030
and sell the drugs
out from under us.

739
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,400
You up for a coffee run,
Officer Nolan?

740
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,030
Uh, yeah, sure.
Coffee?

741
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,110
Wouldn't be a proper stakeout
without coffee.

742
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,780
I'm on it.

743
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,740
First round's on me.

744
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,900
You bet.

745
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,700
I mean, obviously,

746
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,860
I've been using Jackson
and Sterling as a crutch.

747
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,900
Together, they kind of make
the perfect boyfriend.

748
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,650
More importantly,
they're safe, and --

749
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,240
Who are you talking to?

750
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,400
Rachel.

751
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,780
Hey.

752
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,780
Just going for a coffee run.
Can I get you guys anything?

753
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,530
Uh, chai tea latte,
please.

754
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,610
This is a stakeout.
He's not going to Starbucks.

755
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:20,990
Two coffees. Black.

756
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,610
I'll try to find you
some vanilla creamer.

757
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,030
Rachel? I'm back.

758
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,150
Yeah, I totally see
what they're saying,

759
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,650
and -- and they're right.

760
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,070
I don't know if I'm ready.

761
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,150
It's --

762
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:34,320
Oh.

763
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,400
Hello?

764
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,280
Hello?

765
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,860
Rachel is
in a staff meeting,

766
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,820
which means you are
talking to no one.

767
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,610
Not no one.

768
00:29:50,610 --> 00:29:52,700
Me.

769
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,070
I talk things out
to process them,

770
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,820
and I knew you wouldn't do it
with me, so --

771
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,940
Why would you even care
what I think?

772
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,030
What?

773
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,900
The last time I gave you
romantic advice,

774
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,530
I-I pushed you
towards Caleb,

775
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:05,780
and...you almost died.

776
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,320
That's --
That's ridiculous.

777
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,530
There was no reason
to suspect anything.

778
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,150
What happened --

779
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,110
What happened
wasn't your fault.

780
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,530
W-Wasn't mine, either.

781
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,900
Look, I-I wouldn't
ask your advice

782
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,570
if I didn't
value your opinion.

783
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,320
You can do better than Emmett.

784
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,780
What?

785
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,030
Why --
Why would you say that?

786
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,940
He's a firefighter,
for God's sakes.

787
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,990
I know! He's hot!
Okay, no. No.

788
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,900
See, if you're gonna act
all contrarian, I am done
with this conversation.

789
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,490
I'm not being
a contrarian.

790
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:45,990
You know, I-I think you're
threatened by his hunkiness.

791
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,030
Hunkiness?
Mm-hmm.

792
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,990
That's not even a word.

793
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,160
This is nice.

794
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,870
Working together again.

795
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,830
Reminds me
of the old days.

796
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,250
Except back then,
I would be the one in the house

797
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,040
with the target,
wearing the wire.

798
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,040
I like this better.

799
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,290
Having you close.

800
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,490
Are you flirting
with me?

801
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,540
No.

802
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,410
I just think your talents
are being wasted back on patrol.

803
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,620
Really?

804
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,330
'Cause I got talents
you don't even know about.

805
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,990
Now you're flirting
with me.

806
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,330
So, tell me --

807
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,580
why is it
we never hooked up?

808
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,490
'Cause I was married.

809
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:37,370
Yeah.

810
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,370
Well, you're not married
anymore.

811
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,870
Hot coffee is --

812
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,080
You want me
to come back later?

813
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,370
No. Give me
the damn coffee.

814
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,750
Whoa.
We got a bogey.

815
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,330
Neighbor?

816
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,660
Seems nervous.
Keeps moving around.

817
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,750
Could it be
one of Ripper's carriers?

818
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,580
Doubt it.

819
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,120
No backpack, no bag.

820
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,080
It's Bianca.

821
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,830
What the hell
is she doing here?

822
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,040
Double-crossing us.

823
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,410
That would be suicide.

824
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,410
Ripper would know it was her
that gave him up.

825
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:15,410
What was that quote
about a woman scorned?

826
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,790
Uh, point to all units.

827
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,410
Be advised a friendly just
walked into the target house.

828
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,830
Repeat,
friendly is on scene.

829
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,040
Can we get some audio
on this?

830
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,790
What the hell do you want?

831
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,200
The cops are onto you.

832
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,580
Say that again?

833
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,200
I said
the cops are onto you.

834
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,660
How much do they know?

835
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,660
I don't know.

836
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,870
See anything?

837
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:42,540
No. But that doesn't mean
they're not out there.

838
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,330
We've been made.
We got to get in there.

839
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,620
Negative.
We hold here.

840
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,990
Ow! Let go of me!

841
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,790
Screw that!

842
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,620
Nolan's right.
He's gonna kill her.
You gave me up!

843
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,830
He's not gonna kill her
in his house.

844
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,450
If he thought
we were onto him,

845
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,910
he'd create a distraction,
make a run for it.

846
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,830
He's making a run
for it.

847
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,290
Negative.
That's a decoy vehicle.

848
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,490
He's looking to split
our resources and our perimeter.

849
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,120
All units,
stay with the house.

850
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,490
Prepare to make entry,
10 seconds.

851
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,910
Decoy could be
going for the drugs.

852
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,830
Bradford, Chen.

853
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,790
Let the SUV get out of the area
and then stop that vehicle.

854
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:22,700
7-Adam-19, suspect vehicle
spotted heading east on Midland.

855
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,790
Pursuing.

856
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:42,290
C-side perimeter, hold.

857
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,120
All other units,
collapse on our location.

858
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,330

Was Ripper in the SUV?

898
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,150
Unknown. We got ambushed
by a second vehicle.

899
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:12,310
Brown pickup truck.

900
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,770

I thought you ID'd

904
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,890
So, who was in
the intercept vehicle?
No idea.

905
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,980
We've only been up on Ripper
since he hijacked the shipment.

906
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,770
New guy must have been
laying low on purpose,

907
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:32,520

908
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,230
How could they
possibly coordinate an
intercept so quickly?

909
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,600
Cellphone.

910
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,150
We're up on
all of Ripper's phones.

911
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,190
Not the burners.

912
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:42,940
Looks like
he buys them in bulk.

913
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,520
If we can find
the number Ripper used,
we can ping his location.

914
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,150
It's the only empty box.
That's got to be the one.

915
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,520
Call the phone carrier.

916
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,940
Tell them
we have an in-progress,

917
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,020

00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,560

920
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,690
You shouldn't have hit 'em

No!

923

I don't see Bianca.
We need to get in there.

924
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,100

the fentanyl.

926
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,310

You even twitch
towards that gun,

932
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,390
and it'll be
the last thing you do.

933
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,600
I knew you were all wrong.

934
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,190

958
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,600

lost my luster.

to smooth that over.
