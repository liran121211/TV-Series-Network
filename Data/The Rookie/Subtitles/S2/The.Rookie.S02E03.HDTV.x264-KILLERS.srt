1
00:00:02,148 --> 00:00:03,307
Control 7-Adam-07.

2
00:00:03,344 --> 00:00:05,554
Show us at a vehicle stop
on Olympic and Avon.

3
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:07,559
You got this.

4
00:00:11,097 --> 00:00:13,390
Sir, driver's license
and registration, please.

5
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:14,515
What's the problem?

6
00:00:14,552 --> 00:00:16,046
You were doing 50 in a school zone.

7
00:00:16,135 --> 00:00:17,757
What's that sound?

8
00:00:17,794 --> 00:00:18,904
My bees.

9
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:20,038
Your what?

10
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:22,074
Bees. I'm a beekeeper.

11
00:00:22,108 --> 00:00:24,042
I don't know
if I'll be able to control them

12
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:25,210
if you give me a ticket.

13
00:00:25,244 --> 00:00:26,764
Sir, threatening an officer is a crime.

14
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:28,435
Alright, step out of the car.

15
00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:39,458
You okay?

16
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:40,726
Yeah. You?

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,627
I sure am missing my long sleeves.

18
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:44,747
Do we go after him?

19
00:00:44,964 --> 00:00:48,698
Uh, all units, be on the lookout
for a blue minivan.

20
00:00:48,735 --> 00:00:49,935
Look out, it's...

21
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:51,042
...full of bees!

22
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:11,098
- ♪ There it is
- Well, hello!

23
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,214
Well, hello to you, too.

24
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:15,718
Mm. I was talking to the coffee.

25
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:16,889
Mm.

26
00:01:17,163 --> 00:01:18,997
It's too early for dad jokes.

27
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:22,000
I woke up this morning
with an amazing idea...

28
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:23,378
- Hmm?
- ...for the layout,

29
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:25,925
of the master closet.

30
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:28,940
Tell me what you think.

31
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:31,440
Mm.

32
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:33,722
- What?
- Nothing.

33
00:01:34,315 --> 00:01:35,511
I-I mean, I was...

34
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:37,149
I was married for 20 years.

35
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:38,895
"Nothing" usually means
a whole lot of something.

36
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,603
Well, I mean...

37
00:01:40,762 --> 00:01:43,956
you don't even have, like,
a-a built-in shoe rack.

38
00:01:44,064 --> 00:01:46,666
Oh, well, I got, what,
two pairs of shoes?

39
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:48,822
Yeah, but <i>I</i> have a lot more.

40
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,799
O-Oh. Yeah. Uh, right.

41
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,200
Uh, I-I mean, obviously, yeah.

42
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:57,008
I mean, we haven't
even talked about the...

43
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,844
Relax!

44
00:01:59,175 --> 00:02:01,606
It's fine. It's good.
I'm... I'm... I'm kidding.

45
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:02,948
- Right.
- Yeah.

46
00:02:03,518 --> 00:02:05,599
I'm gonna, um... I'm gonna get dressed.

47
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:06,644
- Okay.
- Okay.

48
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:07,818
- Okay.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:10,957 --> 00:02:12,725
Crap.

50
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,349
I'm gonna lose it.

51
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:21,623
Ah, you're back...

52
00:02:22,224 --> 00:02:23,324
You forget something?

53
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:25,293
My car won't start. Again.

54
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:26,552
You need a new one.

55
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,706
I need a healthier bank account.

56
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,954
Uh, I can get you to work,

57
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,507
but you're on your own to get home.

58
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:33,786
Why? What are <i>you doing tonight?</i>

59
00:02:33,823 --> 00:02:34,843
Nothing.

60
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:37,079
I mean, t-that thing. I told you.

61
00:02:37,113 --> 00:02:38,677
- What thing?
- At my mother's.

62
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:40,300
Remember?

63
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:42,971
The mother I haven't met yet?

64
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:45,950
No, you definitely didn't
tell me about that.

65
00:02:45,984 --> 00:02:47,952
Well, you probably had
a lot on your mind.

66
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,122
Do you want to go?

67
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:52,388
Do you <i>want</i> me to go?

68
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:53,529
Of course.

69
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:55,000
- Great!
- Awesome.

70
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,924
Today is problem day.

71
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:04,602
So you know what that means.

72
00:03:04,636 --> 00:03:05,863
Actually, sir, I-I don't.

73
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:07,671
Problem spots on your patrol route.

74
00:03:07,706 --> 00:03:11,976
Locations that attract crime
like a felonious magnet.

75
00:03:12,097 --> 00:03:14,511
Businesses used as a cover
for criminal activity.

76
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:17,308
No-tell motels,
massage parlors, dive bars.

77
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:19,880
Or anywhere that ex-cons gather
to plan their next adventure.

78
00:03:20,277 --> 00:03:22,144
The spots you see every day

79
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:24,986
and you vow to take them down
if you have the time,

80
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:26,209
but we never have the time.

81
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:29,549
So... today we make some.

82
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,593
Is there a problem, Smitty?

83
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:34,886
Oh, no, sir.

84
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,600
I love playing whack-a-mole.

85
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,172
Knock down a problem spot,
it can pop back up anywhere.

86
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:43,107
But that's the job, right?

87
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:45,099
And since you're so excited
about doing it,

88
00:03:45,136 --> 00:03:46,844
I think you should share
your excitement

89
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:48,612
with Officer West out there today.

90
00:03:48,647 --> 00:03:49,840
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

91
00:03:49,877 --> 00:03:50,913
Yeah, seriously.

92
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,184
That means, Lopez, you're with Nolan.

93
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:55,820
Okay. Happy hunting out there.

94
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:00,558
Look, I know you're probably still mad

95
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:01,832
about me not rooming with you, but...

96
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:03,669
Don't flatter yourself, sunshine.

97
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:08,895
So, uh, what's our problem spot?

98
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:11,400
You'll see when we get there.

99
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,705
So...

100
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:16,431
what'd you do last night?

101
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:18,251
Gym. Dinner. Study.

102
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:20,288
Rinse, wash, repeat.

103
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,860
What's that supposed to mean?

104
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,595
Nothing.

105
00:04:27,236 --> 00:04:28,398
You know, it...

106
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,624
it's just been a while
since the divorce.

107
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:32,262
You wanna jog behind the shop
all day, Boot?

108
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,891
No. No.

109
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:35,572
No, sir. Shutting up.

110
00:04:38,897 --> 00:04:41,332
It's just a big step,
and it's never come up.

111
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:43,167
I wasn't prepared, and now she's mad.

112
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,269
Why do relationships
have to be so complicated?

113
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:47,238
Some things, you just shouldn't
spring on someone

114
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:48,832
before they've even had
their morning coffee.

115
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,245
If you can't be honest with each
other, then why even be together?

116
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:53,851
- And now
- Just, some things

117
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:54,931
- I'm sitting here wondering why Wesley
- shouldn't be rushed, and I don't know

118
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:56,114
- doesn't want me to meet his mom.
- if I'm ready to take it to that level.

119
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,990
- Wait, what?
- I thought we were talking about my thing.

120
00:04:58,026 --> 00:04:59,882
I thought we were talking
about <i>my</i> thing.

121
00:05:00,318 --> 00:05:02,550
Wesley said he didn't want you
to meet his mom?

122
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:05,089
- He actually said that?
- He didn't have to.

123
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:14,708
"Problem spots," my ass.

124
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,367
What is that smell?

125
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,942
Like sweat socks and licorice.

126
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,971
This whole city's a problem spot.

127
00:05:21,006 --> 00:05:22,940
Sean John cologne and desperation.

128
00:05:24,398 --> 00:05:25,778
- Pull over at that burger joint.

129
00:05:25,815 --> 00:05:27,768
Seriously? You just ate a burrito.

130
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:30,552
That's the problem spot.

131
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,005
Place has been a haven,

132
00:05:38,042 --> 00:05:40,291
to shady ex-cons since <i>I</i> was a Boot.

133
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:42,362
Ain't never gonna change.

134
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,202
So, what do we do?

135
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:46,239
We sit here. Wait.

136
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:48,675
- For what?
- End of shift.

137
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:51,075
Problem spot. Check.

138
00:05:51,153 --> 00:05:53,578
So, you want us to chill here
in your rank-ass shop?

139
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,880
Rookies. Ohh.

140
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,195
You all think you can change the world.

141
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,518
This is our problem spot?

142
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:14,146
What do you see?

143
00:06:18,037 --> 00:06:19,304
Guy waiting for the bus.

144
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:20,738
Drug dealer.

145
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:23,153
This corner's a mecca
for upper-class dopers.

146
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:25,022
Oxy, Molly, Benzos, Vikes...

147
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:26,944
anything a well-off suburbanite
can choke down

148
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:28,872
with a Kombucha spritzer.

149
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:31,370
And right on cue.

150
00:06:36,504 --> 00:06:37,688
Gonna bust that dealer?

151
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:39,624
Buyer. Dealers are a dime a dozen.

152
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:40,791
We want to scare the clients away

153
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:42,093
so business takes a big hit.

154
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:55,106
Take the lead on this one.

155
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:56,388
Okay.

156
00:06:58,054 --> 00:06:59,129
Morning, sir.

157
00:06:59,203 --> 00:07:01,569
What is the problem, officer?

158
00:07:02,156 --> 00:07:03,814
Is it illegal
to ask for directions now?

159
00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:05,750
Well, you better lock me up.

160
00:07:07,242 --> 00:07:08,719
License and registration, please.

161
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:11,055
My partner and I witnessed you
exchange money for a baggie.

162
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:12,290
Wanna show us what you bought?

163
00:07:12,324 --> 00:07:14,054
No idea what you're talking about.

164
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:16,186
What's this?

165
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:17,995
Oops. How'd that get there?

166
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,630
You work for Councilwoman Langston?

167
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:20,986
I'm her right hand.

168
00:07:21,117 --> 00:07:23,134
Sometimes her left, if you feel me.

169
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:28,034
Look, Officer, uh... Nolan...

170
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:29,240
you got a job to do.

171
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:30,377
I get it. Believe me.

172
00:07:30,414 --> 00:07:32,492
Nobody appreciates the boys...
and girls...

173
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:33,689
in blue more than me.

174
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:36,591
It's just, you see, Langston...

175
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,895
she needed me to find her
some, uh, sleep aids.

176
00:07:39,117 --> 00:07:41,865
- Oh. Yeah.
- Just hand over the baggie.

177
00:07:43,271 --> 00:07:44,971
No big deal.

178
00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:47,325
Now you, uh, let me off with a warning,

179
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:49,126
win yourself
some pretty powerful friends

180
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:50,321
down at City Hall.

181
00:07:50,357 --> 00:07:52,319
Oh. Sounds like quite an offer.

182
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:55,032
<i>Councilwoman Langston's office.</i>

183
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:56,834
But I'm doing okay
in the friend department.

184
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:58,639
- No, no, no. No, no, no. Uh, um...
<i>- Hello?</i>

185
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:00,264
I'm sorry.
T-The pills... t-t-they're mine.

186
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:02,102
- <i>Hello?</i>
- P-P-Please hang up. Please?

187
00:08:04,347 --> 00:08:05,827
I just needed something
to take the edge off.

188
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:08,201
You can't imagine
what I go through every day.

189
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,848
The wife, boss, the constant
pressure. It's just...

190
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,857
Jump out of the car.
We're locking you up.

191
00:08:15,926 --> 00:08:16,997
<i>Come over here,</i>

192
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:18,274
- <i>put your hands on the car.</i>
- Yes, sir.

193
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:22,778
- We gonna be here a while?
- Yep.

194
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:25,129
Then I need to arrange childcare.

195
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:27,865
Yeah, sure. You get one call
once we're done processing you.

196
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:28,966
Thanks.

197
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,082
Hey. I know you're gonna say no,

198
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,379
but...

199
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,777
- ...I think I can help.
- With what?

200
00:08:37,814 --> 00:08:40,283
Well, you know, I know how hard
it is to meet people in L.A.

201
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,598
It's what keeps <i>them in business.</i>

202
00:08:44,553 --> 00:08:45,787
Wait.

203
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:48,249
You wanna set me up?

204
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,855
Forget it.

205
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,393
Even if this wasn't
your dumbest idea yet,

206
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,360
there is no way you'd be able
to pick someone right for me.

207
00:08:57,562 --> 00:08:59,997
Um, I bet I <i>can.</i>

208
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:01,304
I'm serious.

209
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,907
If I can fix you up
on one good date, just one,

210
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:05,943
I get to, uh...

211
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:07,879
I get to wear short sleeves.

212
00:09:13,793 --> 00:09:14,863
Okay.

213
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,261
Okay.

214
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,760
- But you're paying.
- Whatever.

215
00:09:17,797 --> 00:09:20,373
And if you lose,
- you're gonna do 50 push-ups

216
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,378
after every call we take.

217
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,337
Okay. New plan.

218
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:38,880
You drink your soda, and I'm
gonna go do some policing.

219
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,007
Here they come.

220
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:44,275
Keep cool.

221
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:48,600
- Morning, officers.
<i>- Boys.</i>

222
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:49,947
My partner here is a newbie

223
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:52,450
who wants to learn about
problem spots in town.

224
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:53,818
So here we are.

225
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,145
- I'm just eating.
- Sure you are.

226
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,996
<i>Danny Dozier.</i>

227
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,590
<i>You just did four years in Chino.</i>

228
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:01,526
Armed robbery, was it?

229
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:04,562
And you.

230
00:10:04,747 --> 00:10:06,930
Weren't you the wheelman
for Larry Marks?

231
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:10,401
Think of this as a
lowlife employment agency.

232
00:10:10,497 --> 00:10:13,571
Each of these dirtbags has
a set of illicit skills,

233
00:10:13,605 --> 00:10:16,006
and they are just itching
for a chance to use 'em.

234
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,749
Hmm. Last time I checked,

235
00:10:17,786 --> 00:10:20,311
associating with felons was
a no-no for parolees.

236
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:22,280
Raise your hand if you're on parole.

237
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,103
Look, don't make me
run you through the system.

238
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:26,822
It'll just piss me off.

239
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,531
There we go. That's more like it.

240
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,222
Everybody grab some wall.

241
00:10:31,537 --> 00:10:33,972
Come on. Right this way.

242
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:38,793
Speed it up.

243
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:43,167
What are you doing?

244
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:44,535
Just kick 'em loose with a warning.

245
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:46,036
Tell them not to come back.

246
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:47,498
Problem spot handled.

247
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:49,897
They break the law, they go in.

248
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,650
Go, kid.

249
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:01,218
Foot pursuit.

250
00:11:01,253 --> 00:11:03,020
White male, gray shirt and blue jeans,

251
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:04,494
headed north on Fillmore.

252
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:53,404
Why'd you run, huh?

253
00:11:53,438 --> 00:11:54,567
Stand up.

254
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:58,242
Spread your feet.

255
00:12:00,536 --> 00:12:02,130
- Where's the gun?
- I don't got one.

256
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:03,388
I just like bullets.

257
00:12:03,425 --> 00:12:04,625
That ain't a crime, is it?

258
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,631
He must have dumped the gun somewhere
between here and the burger joint.

259
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:08,762
Help!

260
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,266
Somebody please help me!

261
00:12:10,303 --> 00:12:12,192
I need help! Please, somebody!

262
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:13,859
Calvin, g...

263
00:12:14,544 --> 00:12:16,038
Calvin! Give me the gun, baby.

264
00:12:16,075 --> 00:12:17,394
Baby, please. Give me the gun.

265
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:18,509
Calvin!

266
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:19,704
Hey, Calvin?

267
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:21,599
Hey, buddy. It's not a toy, okay?

268
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,133
Please put the gun down.

269
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:24,268
Calvin, give me the gun!

270
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:25,725
Hey, buddy, please put the gun down.

271
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:27,636
- Calvin, give me the gun!
- It's not a toy! Put the gun...

272
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:33,955
Gunshot wound to the upper-right chest!

273
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:49,471
You did this.

274
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:51,669
- I didn't do nothin'.
- It was <i>your</i> gun!

275
00:12:52,186 --> 00:12:53,521
Prove it.

276
00:12:58,681 --> 00:13:00,260
Thank you anyway.

277
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:01,762
Rachel?

278
00:13:01,984 --> 00:13:03,326
Look at you!

279
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:05,537
- Oh, my G...
- All official!

280
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:07,222
- Mm!
- Mm!

281
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:09,412
You were the talk
of the reunion, you know.

282
00:13:09,464 --> 00:13:10,907
I was bummed I couldn't go.

283
00:13:11,021 --> 00:13:12,389
- What are you doing here?
- Oh,

284
00:13:12,426 --> 00:13:14,563
just trying to cut
through some red tape.

285
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:16,881
But so far, my scissors
haven't been sharp enough.

286
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:18,615
Oh, problems in Child Services?

287
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:20,392
Yeah, civil standbys.

288
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:22,630
LAPD needs a faster response time.

289
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,701
I've had four go sideways
in the last month.

290
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:25,788
Mm.

291
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:29,475
Hey. Maybe you can help me.

292
00:13:29,512 --> 00:13:31,089
I-I wish I could,

293
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,582
but I am <i>below</i>
bottom of the food chain here.

294
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:34,824
- It's...
- <i>Boot!</i>

295
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:35,925
Get a move on.

296
00:13:35,962 --> 00:13:37,930
No lunch till you finish those reports.

297
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:39,814
Who's that?

298
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:41,952
That is my training officer.

299
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,825
I should probably go.

300
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:48,191
Hey, uh, you're single,

301
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,543
- right?
- Mm-hmm.

302
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,829
Would you want to go out with him?

303
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:54,160
Uh, he's hot...

304
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,605
but I-I made a vow.

305
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,533
- No more jerks.
<i>- Let's go, Boot!</i>

306
00:14:00,176 --> 00:14:02,750
Okay, so, you don't date jerks.

307
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:06,148
But how would you like to
help me win a bet <i>against</i> one?

308
00:14:11,187 --> 00:14:12,313
Let's go.

309
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,749
We gotta take this dirtbag
back to the station,

310
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:16,473
get him processed.

311
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:20,406
You alright?

312
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:22,754
No.

313
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:25,498
I...

314
00:14:25,979 --> 00:14:27,878
I should have tackled the kid.

315
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:30,295
Taken the bullet myself.

316
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:35,709
That's a no-win situation.

317
00:14:35,981 --> 00:14:37,589
Had you reacted differently,

318
00:14:38,014 --> 00:14:40,424
maybe the kid would have
shot himself instead.

319
00:14:41,223 --> 00:14:42,324
Hey.

320
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:45,965
You did the right thing.

321
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:48,957
Yeah, it was... it wasn't enough.

322
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:52,062
Hey, Jess.

323
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:55,068
It's me. Just trying you... again.

324
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:56,781
Call me back.

325
00:14:57,099 --> 00:14:58,506
Okay.

326
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:01,764
She is definitely mad at me

327
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,349
and ducking my calls.

328
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,670
What time is dinner with Mom?

329
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:07,974
- Huh?
- Dinner.

330
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:09,483
Oh. Um...

331
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,779
At 8:00, I think.

332
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:12,014
You know, there is no world

333
00:15:12,051 --> 00:15:14,644
in which Wesley is embarrassed by you.

334
00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,838
If that was what you were worried about.

335
00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:19,782
It's not.

336
00:15:20,056 --> 00:15:21,879
I'm not charging him.

337
00:15:21,936 --> 00:15:23,633
You're kidding me. Why not?

338
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:25,085
You never saw the gun
in his possession,

339
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:26,282
and his prints weren't on it.

340
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,092
All you got was a
pocket full of bullets.

341
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:29,220
There's no crime in that.

342
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:30,819
Bullets are the same caliber
as the gun.

343
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:32,288
It's a 9-millimeter.

344
00:15:32,325 --> 00:15:33,530
Most common handgun there is.

345
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,068
He tossed the gun
while I was chasing him,

346
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:36,807
and a <i>child</i> picked it up.

347
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:39,374
- But you didn't see it.
- That kid could've killed himself.

348
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:41,076
As it is, his mother almost died.

349
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,410
The kid is traumatized.

350
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,049
So how in the hell
can you kick this guy loose?

351
00:15:44,086 --> 00:15:46,212
It's not a case that we can win.
I'm sorry.

352
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,807
I have to get back to court.

353
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:57,651
Don't call her again.

354
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:59,133
When she's ready, she'll call <i>you.</i>

355
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:00,895
You're right.

356
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:06,693
- Turn around.
- What?

357
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,010
There's a guy back there being chased.

358
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:12,606
<i>Control 7-Adam-15,
suspicious circs on 5th and Beaudry,</i>

359
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:13,942
<i>requesting backup.</i>

360
00:16:21,881 --> 00:16:24,387
Back up!
Back up! Move your vehicle!

361
00:16:24,654 --> 00:16:26,688
Come on! Come on, damn it!

362
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,146
- You see them?
- There.

363
00:16:57,831 --> 00:16:58,998
Back seat clear.

364
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,237
<i>Front seat clear.</i>

365
00:17:00,341 --> 00:17:01,842
So, where'd they go?

366
00:17:01,924 --> 00:17:03,191
Head upstai...

367
00:17:09,606 --> 00:17:12,452
Coming through. Out of the way!

368
00:17:13,729 --> 00:17:14,929
What do we have?

369
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:16,721
Patient suffered
a fractured left femur,

370
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:18,313
possible internal bleeding,
and head trauma.

371
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:19,422
- BP?
- Stable.

372
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,221
They gave him two liters
of saline on the way over.

373
00:17:21,258 --> 00:17:22,315
- Hi.
- Hey.

374
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:23,552
What happened to him? Car accident?

375
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:25,695
No, no. He, uh, got
dropped off a footbridge.

376
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:27,396
Landed on top of a car
right in front of us.

377
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:28,604
- Do you know his name?
- Uh, yeah,

378
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,477
driver's license says he's Cesar Ojeda.

379
00:17:30,514 --> 00:17:32,414
Okay. We need a CT scan. Alert the OR.

380
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,552
- He's jumping the line.
- Not before I talk to him.

381
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:36,818
- Jessica Russo. DHS.
- Hey.

382
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,096
That's not possible.

383
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:39,500
Well, <i>make</i> it possible.

384
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:41,502
He's unconscious and probably
bleeding internally.

385
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:43,039
If we delay surgery, he could die.

386
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,414
- Is that what you want?
- Nobody wants that, right?

387
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:47,773
N-No. I... Fine. Fine.

388
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,425
I just need to talk to him
as soon as he wakes up.

389
00:17:49,462 --> 00:17:51,196
Of course. Let's move.

390
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,274
So, who was that guy,

391
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:58,134
and why did you have to
talk to him so badly?

392
00:17:58,276 --> 00:17:59,954
I can't really tell you that.

393
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:01,158
Can't or won't?

394
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:03,129
I ran the plates
on the car that chased him.

395
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,597
It was reported stolen last week.

396
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:05,911
What about the guys inside?

397
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:07,903
They were gone by the time
backup cleared the building.

398
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,568
What's your interest?

399
00:18:11,475 --> 00:18:13,988
His real name is Alejandro Mejia.

400
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:15,993
He's undercover DHS.

401
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:18,487
He disappeared about six weeks
ago during an infiltration,

402
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:19,775
and I was alerted,

403
00:18:19,812 --> 00:18:21,663
when you ran his cover
ID through the system.

404
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,668
Wow. So, what was he into?

405
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:25,839
I-I'm not cleared to tell you that.

406
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:27,757
So, DHS is taking this over?

407
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,759
Yes, but I would really appreciate it

408
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:31,460
if you could provide
some extra security

409
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:33,055
until my guys got here.

410
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:33,839
Of course.

411
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:35,292
Excuse me.

412
00:18:35,329 --> 00:18:36,729
Yes, sir?

413
00:18:36,766 --> 00:18:38,533
Yeah, she's definitely mad at you.

414
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,172
<i>Yes, he's, um...
he's unconscious and...</i>

415
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:43,218
She's a social worker?

416
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:44,982
You say that like it's equivalent

417
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:46,409
to being a serial killer.

418
00:18:46,446 --> 00:18:48,347
No. Social workers do valuable work...

419
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:49,846
coddling criminals.

420
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:52,696
- Look, if you're not even gonna try...
- Hold your water, Boot.

421
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,927
I'm just getting the lay
of the land on my "date."

422
00:18:54,964 --> 00:18:56,663
- So, where are you taking her?
- Ravenna.

423
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:59,034
That... sounds expensive.

424
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,772
Oh. It <i>is.</i>

425
00:19:00,957 --> 00:19:03,959
They've got a $100 filet,
just melts in your mouth.

426
00:19:04,097 --> 00:19:06,300
And their wine list... ohh!
It's exceptional.

427
00:19:06,337 --> 00:19:07,530
Well, good.

428
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:10,179
It seems like a really romantic place.

429
00:19:10,302 --> 00:19:11,783
- Hmm.
- What?

430
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,862
You're gonna have to do
so many push-ups.

431
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,541
Anyway, this... is Rachel.

432
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:22,511
Pretty.

433
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:24,346
West, where's Smitty?

434
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:26,495
Probably watching "Judge Judy"
in the break room.

435
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,700
Sir, was pairing us up
meant to be added punishment?

436
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:30,629
Think of it more as a kick in the pants.

437
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:32,425
No way you're advancing
back to short sleeves

438
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,363
until I see the fire back in your eyes.

439
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:37,742
You collared a guy named
Gleason Dunn earlier, right?

440
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:38,858
Yeah.

441
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:40,144
You ship him downtown yet?

442
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:42,227
No, he's, uh, being processed out.

443
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,019
ADA told me to kick him. Why?

444
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:46,399
Ballistics came back
on the gun the kid fired.

445
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,169
It was used in
- an unsolved murder last year.

446
00:19:49,713 --> 00:19:50,763
What?

447
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,701
They pulled a DNA sample
from the scene,

448
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,408
but there was no match in the system.

449
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,037
Dunn's DNA isn't in the system.
We don't have it.

450
00:19:57,164 --> 00:19:58,503
Well, we need to get a sample.

451
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:13,350
Excuse me.

452
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,897
Gleason Dunn.

453
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:16,458
- Where is he?
- Released.

454
00:20:16,744 --> 00:20:18,138
About 10 minutes ago.

455
00:20:21,643 --> 00:20:23,644
Okay. I'm... I'm on my way in.

456
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,843
Hey.

457
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,808
- Hey.
- So, about this morning...

458
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:32,189
Oh. This is not the right time.

459
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:33,509
- Right.
- Yeah.

460
00:20:33,871 --> 00:20:36,185
And also, I mean, it's not a big deal.

461
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:37,581
So we're good?

462
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,130
Yeah. Uh,

463
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,535
- why wouldn't we be?
- Right.

464
00:20:41,572 --> 00:20:42,678
I brought Grey up to speed.

465
00:20:42,715 --> 00:20:44,121
He said he'd give you
whatever you need.

466
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,684
- Oh, great.
- Any chance you got more clearance

467
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:48,284
- to tell us about Mejia?
- Yes.

468
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:52,268
He's a forensic accountant,
an expert in cryptocurrency.

469
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:54,449
We put him inside
an illegal arms operation,

470
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,671
where he was supposed to
target their financials

471
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:58,905
and then neutralize their access.

472
00:20:58,942 --> 00:21:00,520
By what? Changing all their passwords?

473
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:01,977
Basically, yeah.

474
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:03,753
The downside of digital money.

475
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,239
Then Mejia went silent, what'd you say,

476
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:06,969
- about six weeks ago?
- Mm-hmm.

477
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:08,451
So we presumed

478
00:21:08,488 --> 00:21:10,252
- he was either dead or...
- Compromised.

479
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:11,633
No wonder you need to talk to him.

480
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,838
Look, um, I've got to go brief my boss.

481
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:15,889
DHS is gonna be mobilizing

482
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:17,380
some agents to come stand watch.

483
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,169
Are you good until they arrive?

484
00:21:19,206 --> 00:21:21,092
Like Grey said, anything you need.

485
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:23,070
Hmm.

486
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,953
Alright, I'm gonna take the shop.

487
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,779
Dispatch will arrange pickup
once you're replaced.

488
00:21:26,824 --> 00:21:28,857
- You're leaving?
- I gotta get dressed for dinner.

489
00:21:28,982 --> 00:21:30,583
The great thing about you
being a phase three now

490
00:21:30,628 --> 00:21:32,599
is I don't have to supervise you 24/7.

491
00:21:32,636 --> 00:21:33,940
So have fun on guard duty.

492
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:35,644
Good luck with Mommie Dearest.

493
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:45,179
I briefed my buddies
on Midnight shift about Gleason.

494
00:21:45,395 --> 00:21:46,756
They'll get him.

495
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:51,545
You know, it's not too late.

496
00:21:51,795 --> 00:21:53,779
- For what?
- Scale of 1 to 10,

497
00:21:53,816 --> 00:21:56,005
how sure are you the
gun belonged to Gleason?

498
00:21:56,169 --> 00:21:57,273
10.

499
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,207
Then maybe you need to revise
your statement to the ADA.

500
00:22:01,004 --> 00:22:04,568
You're a rookie whose vision
got blurry in the fog of war,

501
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:05,972
but now you're clear,

502
00:22:06,009 --> 00:22:08,308
and you <i>did</i> see him toss the weapon.

503
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,623
Write it up like that,
and I'll back you.

504
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:23,692
I'd be lying.

505
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,392
Kid, you're in the honeymoon
period of being a cop.

506
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:30,576
Full of piss and righteous vinegar.

507
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:32,551
But it's not a black-and-white world.

508
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:33,749
Never has been.

509
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:35,815
Look, right and wrong matter.

510
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,045
Otherwise, why bother
pinning on the badge?

511
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:39,328
It's not about right and wrong.

512
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:42,104
It's about getting the bad guys
off the street.

513
00:22:42,555 --> 00:22:44,823
How you gonna feel
- if we can't pin Gleason down

514
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,427
and he hurts more people?

515
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:47,701
Or worse.

516
00:22:47,738 --> 00:22:49,519
It can't be worse than today.

517
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:51,669
Oh, it can always get worse.

518
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:57,253
Yeah?

519
00:22:57,594 --> 00:22:58,952
Okay, thanks.

520
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:05,290
The mom died on the operating table.

521
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:08,037
I'm sorry.

522
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:15,810
<i>Yes!</i>

523
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:18,584
<i>I'm so glad she wore that dress.</i>

524
00:23:18,618 --> 00:23:19,985
She didn't want to look too sexy,

525
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,522
but, uh, Mama needs to get
into some short sleeves.

526
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,649
Yo. Where did you go?

527
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:29,495
Sorry. Uh...

528
00:23:29,963 --> 00:23:31,956
I can't stop thinking about my guy.

529
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:34,527
He killed someone,
and I just let him walk.

530
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,935
Dude, you did what the
ADA told you to do,

531
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:38,504
and now you're trying to fix it.

532
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:40,409
Night shift is on the hunt.

533
00:23:40,847 --> 00:23:42,848
- Yeah.
- Head in the game.

534
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:44,129
Let's go.

535
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:45,488
- This is so weird.
- Uh-huh.

536
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:46,621
Yep, yep, yep.

537
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:49,424
So, you've, uh...

538
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,417
you've known Chen since...

539
00:23:51,451 --> 00:23:52,612
I mean, Lucy,

540
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:54,050
since college?

541
00:23:54,087 --> 00:23:56,255
Yeah, we were in psych class together.

542
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:57,294
Hmm.

543
00:23:57,331 --> 00:23:58,684
Bet she hasn't changed a bit.

544
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:01,360
No. Always playing matchmaker.

545
00:24:01,394 --> 00:24:03,629
Well, this is my favorite place.

546
00:24:03,663 --> 00:24:04,863
Best filet in town.

547
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:06,999
Oh, I don't eat red meat.

548
00:24:07,033 --> 00:24:08,177
Sea bass is great, too.

549
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:10,182
Nothing that had a face.

550
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:13,105
I'm on a raw-food diet, actually.

551
00:24:13,248 --> 00:24:15,423
You know, reduce my imprint.

552
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:22,315
Oh, wait. What happened?

553
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:23,708
They stopped talking.

554
00:24:25,585 --> 00:24:27,686
This is like watching
a nature documentary.

555
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:30,389
You're just waiting for the
gazelle to get eaten by the jaguar.

556
00:24:34,294 --> 00:24:35,861
Oh, my God.

557
00:24:35,895 --> 00:24:37,459
I'm gonna lose this bet.

558
00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:39,131
Pbht.

559
00:24:39,466 --> 00:24:41,634
Look, you seem nice and all,

560
00:24:41,668 --> 00:24:43,736
so I probably should just
tell you the truth.

561
00:24:43,989 --> 00:24:48,140
I let Lucy set us up tonight
because she made me a bet.

562
00:24:48,231 --> 00:24:50,709
And, um, you want her to lose.

563
00:24:50,905 --> 00:24:53,078
No, I want me to win.

564
00:24:53,396 --> 00:24:55,714
Being here with me isn't a win?

565
00:24:59,886 --> 00:25:01,020
Maybe a little.

566
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,821
Mm-hmm.

567
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:07,159
You know what would be a win for <i>me?</i>

568
00:25:09,596 --> 00:25:12,286
If you could get me...

569
00:25:13,824 --> 00:25:16,826
...a direct line
to your watch commander

570
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,997
so I could talk to him
about civil standbys.

571
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:30,032
I could do that.

572
00:25:30,073 --> 00:25:32,351
- Really?
- Yeah.

573
00:25:32,705 --> 00:25:34,687
And what would you want in return?

574
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,964
I'm gonna be in long sleeves forever.

575
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:53,845
Where am I?

576
00:25:53,882 --> 00:25:55,641
You're in the hospital, Mr. Mejia.

577
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:57,209
You just underwent surgery.

578
00:25:57,332 --> 00:25:59,482
- You know my name?
- Yes, I do.

579
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:01,617
I'm working with DHS... Jessica Russo.

580
00:26:01,654 --> 00:26:03,822
She told us about your undercover op.

581
00:26:04,074 --> 00:26:05,875
Looks like you have
quite a tale to tell.

582
00:26:05,967 --> 00:26:07,918
- I need to get outta here.
- Not just yet.

583
00:26:07,955 --> 00:26:09,627
You've been through a great deal.

584
00:26:09,664 --> 00:26:12,203
Um, the men who were chasing you...

585
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,812
can you ID them?

586
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:15,566
No.

587
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:16,962
Why did they throw you off the bridge?

588
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:19,064
They didn't. I jumped.

589
00:26:19,252 --> 00:26:21,689
- Why?
- Seemed necessary at the time.

590
00:26:21,801 --> 00:26:23,235
Were they trying to kill you?

591
00:26:23,752 --> 00:26:24,970
Worse.

592
00:26:25,244 --> 00:26:26,946
What do you mean by that?

593
00:26:28,367 --> 00:26:29,767
Mr. Mejia?

594
00:26:31,963 --> 00:26:34,565
Come on. We got to
get to my mom's party.

595
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,633
No.

596
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:37,790
Not until you admit,

597
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:40,054
you never mentioned this
thing with your mom before.

598
00:26:40,185 --> 00:26:41,752
I-I thought I did.

599
00:26:44,952 --> 00:26:46,219
Okay, fine. I didn't.

600
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,760
I knew it.
You didn't want her to meet me.

601
00:26:47,794 --> 00:26:48,927
Angela.

602
00:26:48,962 --> 00:26:50,157
Is it because I'm...

603
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:51,790
- spirited?
- No.

604
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,665
You got us a chess clock
to mediate our arguments.

605
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,267
- I know, but that's not what this...
- And I can be a little feral

606
00:26:56,304 --> 00:26:58,270
- when I eat sometimes, but...
- Angela.

607
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:03,042
This wasn't about <i>you.</i>

608
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:05,356
What does that mean?

609
00:27:07,184 --> 00:27:09,904
Look, I have to tell you something...

610
00:27:10,586 --> 00:27:12,184
but I don't want you to freak out.

611
00:27:16,222 --> 00:27:17,479
You're rich.

612
00:27:17,516 --> 00:27:19,998
Well, wealth is relative.

613
00:27:20,544 --> 00:27:22,083
Yeah. Super rich.

614
00:27:22,195 --> 00:27:25,864
Oh, look who decided
to grace us with his presence.

615
00:27:25,899 --> 00:27:27,719
Hello, darling.

616
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:29,477
- Hello, my dear!
- Hi.

617
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,583
Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.

618
00:27:32,772 --> 00:27:34,354
You are simply stunning.

619
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:36,041
Thank you. You are, too, Mrs. Evers.

620
00:27:36,075 --> 00:27:37,810
And... And this beautiful house.

621
00:27:37,844 --> 00:27:39,344
Come on. Let's get you a drink.

622
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:47,133
So, what made you decide
to become a police officer?

623
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:49,251
Well, I love my city
and wanted to give back.

624
00:27:49,355 --> 00:27:51,438
- Mm.
- Getting to kick ass helped, too.

625
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:55,391
Well, I, for one,
thank you for your service.

626
00:27:55,695 --> 00:27:59,565
You know, you put 'em in jail,
and my son tries to get 'em out.

627
00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:00,897
Mother.

628
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,367
Why do you keep calling me "Mother,"

629
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:04,062
like... like this is "Downton Abbey"?

630
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,278
Insufferable, isn't he?

631
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:06,572
Definitely, but he's cute.

632
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:08,674
You know, his grandfather founded

633
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,943
the biggest law firm in Beverly Hills,

634
00:28:11,012 --> 00:28:14,112
but Wesley insists on working pro bono,

635
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:17,816
over a restaurant that
serves $5.99 buffets.

636
00:28:17,853 --> 00:28:20,338
Mother... Mom.

637
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:22,254
Well, I just want to give you
a helping hand

638
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:24,122
from time to time,
but you slap it away.

639
00:28:24,157 --> 00:28:25,583
Well, I do fine on my own.

640
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,491
But you could do so much more.

641
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:30,390
Okay, can we not talk about this
right now, in front of Angela?

642
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:34,132
But you're living together.
She's family.

643
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:35,320
And, you know,

644
00:28:35,357 --> 00:28:37,502
there's never really a
good time to talk with you.

645
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:39,408
I-I know you want to
do it all on your own

646
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:40,799
and not touch your trust fund...

647
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:41,906
- Trust fund?
- ...but

648
00:28:41,943 --> 00:28:44,043
the fact that you seem
mad at me about it,

649
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,777
that is just messed up.

650
00:28:45,812 --> 00:28:47,112
How's your wine?

651
00:28:47,164 --> 00:28:48,220
Amazing.

652
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:51,116
Yeah, I picked it up
at a spa retreat in Tuscany.

653
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:52,744
I'm going again in March.

654
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:53,952
You should come.

655
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:55,254
Wesley, you two should come.

656
00:28:55,288 --> 00:28:56,900
- 100% yes.
- Yes.

657
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:58,257
Mm. You know what?

658
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,509
I'm gonna take an Uber home.

659
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,239
The two of you, just...

660
00:29:02,362 --> 00:29:04,396
enjoy each other.

661
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:05,962
Come on, Wesley.

662
00:29:05,999 --> 00:29:07,566
Always with the drama.

663
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,203
I should go after him.

664
00:29:09,277 --> 00:29:11,531
Oh, nonsense. He's a grown man.

665
00:29:11,621 --> 00:29:13,854
Besides, I want you to taste the stew.

666
00:29:14,311 --> 00:29:16,245
<i>It's my own recipe.</i>

667
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:19,912
- It does smell good.
- Mm-hmm.

668
00:29:23,282 --> 00:29:24,332
Hi.

669
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:26,271
I'm here to transfer
the patient to the ICU

670
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:28,742
for some serial exams,
check for any internal bleeding.

671
00:29:28,855 --> 00:29:30,989
- Sure. Uh, do you mind if I...?
- Sure.

672
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,991
Susan Taylor. How long
have you worked here, Susan?

673
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:34,426
A lot of fives.

674
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:37,129
Five months in the ICU,
five years at the hospital,

675
00:29:37,163 --> 00:29:39,431
and, uh, since 5:00 this morning...

676
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:40,617
5:30, actually...

677
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,267
Okay, well, I'm gonna need
to accompany you.

678
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,916
No problem.

679
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,539
- Why do I do this?
- Do what?

680
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,767
Infiltrate myself into everything.

681
00:29:48,804 --> 00:29:51,310
- I'm like a virus.
- You're not a virus.

682
00:29:51,344 --> 00:29:52,778
Yes. I am.

683
00:29:52,812 --> 00:29:54,379
Why do I care if Tim dates?

684
00:29:54,414 --> 00:29:55,586
Why do I care why

685
00:29:55,623 --> 00:29:57,313
- anyone does anything?
- Okay, you just

686
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,445
want everyone to be happy.

687
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:00,141
- That's a good quality.
- No, you know what I want?

688
00:30:00,178 --> 00:30:01,258
To get drunk.

689
00:30:01,295 --> 00:30:03,356
Let's get a butt load of tequila,

690
00:30:03,393 --> 00:30:04,567
get up on the roof of our building,

691
00:30:04,604 --> 00:30:06,084
and listen to music
from the Hollywood Bowl.

692
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:07,481
That's what I want.

693
00:30:07,517 --> 00:30:08,673
Hello?

694
00:30:08,752 --> 00:30:09,802
Yeah.

695
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:13,538
Thank you for letting me know.

696
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:14,588
What was that?

697
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,262
Night shift still hasn't found Gleason.

698
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,637
Bastard's still walking
around out there.

699
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,351
Just give 'em time.

700
00:30:21,505 --> 00:30:23,109
- What are you doing?
- Getting my car.

701
00:30:23,146 --> 00:30:24,205
I'm going for a ride.

702
00:30:24,242 --> 00:30:26,712
Going for a ride up the PCH
with a little bit of sad music

703
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:28,735
or a little off-duty action?

704
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:31,359
Okay. I'll drive.

705
00:30:31,492 --> 00:30:32,953
Hey, Jess.

706
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:35,726
Oh, yeah, well, no,
he was a-awake for a minute,

707
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:37,297
and now he's unconscious again.

708
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:39,355
They're just transferring him to ICU.

709
00:30:40,093 --> 00:30:42,227
Right. Okay. I'll see you in a few.

710
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,764
How's it going?

711
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:47,165
Good. Yeah, good.

712
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,964
Uh, Jessica's on her way here
to question him.

713
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,006
It... seems like you
know her pretty well.

714
00:30:51,174 --> 00:30:53,038
Yeah. Well, we're dating.

715
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:54,740
Really?

716
00:30:54,774 --> 00:30:57,067
- What?
- Nothing.

717
00:30:57,226 --> 00:30:58,671
She's j... She's a little intense.

718
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:01,181
Oh, that's... just "work Jessica."

719
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:02,652
Yeah, she's... she's different at home.

720
00:31:02,689 --> 00:31:03,820
Sure.

721
00:31:03,883 --> 00:31:05,384
- What?
- Nothing. Um...

722
00:31:05,418 --> 00:31:08,377
She just... She doesn't
really seem like your type.

723
00:31:08,414 --> 00:31:09,734
- My type?
- Never mind.

724
00:31:09,771 --> 00:31:11,039
You know what? I'm gonna shut up.

725
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,525
People can change a lot in 20 years.

726
00:31:15,195 --> 00:31:17,036
W-What are you doing outside the ICU?

727
00:31:17,112 --> 00:31:19,632
Oh, uh, the nurse transferred
Mejia here from post-op.

728
00:31:19,695 --> 00:31:21,128
They needed to run some tests.

729
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,138
But I just... I spoke with the surgeon.

730
00:31:23,175 --> 00:31:24,976
He didn't want to move Mejia yet.

731
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:26,571
He was gonna do the exams <i>in</i> post-op.

732
00:31:40,255 --> 00:31:41,856
I need this hospital put
on immediate lockdown!

733
00:31:41,893 --> 00:31:43,067
Nobody in or out.

734
00:31:43,232 --> 00:31:45,049
7-Adam-15, 207 at Shaw Memorial.

735
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:47,005
I need backup,
unknown number of suspects,

736
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:48,543
possibly armed, Code 3.

737
00:31:57,895 --> 00:31:59,115
Remember me?

738
00:31:59,152 --> 00:32:00,474
Smitty's rookie?

739
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:02,303
Had you dead to rights
on a parole violation?

740
00:32:02,347 --> 00:32:04,200
Yeah. What do you want?

741
00:32:04,237 --> 00:32:06,295
Your boy. Gleason Dunn.

742
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:07,689
Tell me where he is,

743
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,460
and these officers
might just let you go.

744
00:32:09,497 --> 00:32:12,199
- He's not my boy.
- He destroyed a family today,

745
00:32:12,236 --> 00:32:13,778
dumped a gun for a child to find.

746
00:32:13,815 --> 00:32:15,349
Life's full of tragedy.

747
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:17,344
You want your life to become one?

748
00:32:18,082 --> 00:32:20,129
'Cause I'm hoping for a couple
more decades on the job,

749
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:22,160
years I will spend making
your life a living hell

750
00:32:22,197 --> 00:32:23,420
if you don't come clean.

751
00:32:23,537 --> 00:32:25,238
Is that really something
you want to sign up for?

752
00:32:25,321 --> 00:32:27,990
'Cause it seems smarter to just
give the guy up and go home.

753
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:35,470
Police!

754
00:34:24,955 --> 00:34:28,225
Passwords, or I start taking off ears.

755
00:34:28,262 --> 00:34:29,753
I don't... I don't...

756
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,525
I don't know them
- off the top of my head, man.

757
00:34:31,562 --> 00:34:33,162
I got them stored back at my place!

758
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,269
Nice try.

759
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,237
Guess I'm taking some pieces off
to get the truth.

760
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,375
I'm telling you the truth!
I swear! Come on!

761
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:39,976
Police! Drop the saw!

762
00:34:40,013 --> 00:34:43,310
Stand up right now,
or I will shoot you.

763
00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:44,397
Do not test me.

764
00:34:50,626 --> 00:34:52,827
Okay. Okay, you got me.

765
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:55,159
Back up. Hands behind your head.
Interlace your fingers.

766
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,818
No problem, officer,
but I got a bad shoulder.

767
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:00,587
Shut up. Turn around.

768
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:03,533
I don't know if I can...

769
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:05,476
Stay right there.

770
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:13,025
You see where he went?

771
00:35:13,062 --> 00:35:14,302
No, I didn't see where he went.

772
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:16,205
Can you get this damn saw away from me?

773
00:35:19,024 --> 00:35:20,343
- Can you walk?
- I don't think so.

774
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,334
- Stay right there.
- I don't think I have a choice.

775
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:23,702
Give me your backup.

776
00:35:23,736 --> 00:35:25,455
Come on, man. I need a weapon.

777
00:35:26,873 --> 00:35:28,307
Got it?

778
00:35:58,566 --> 00:35:59,886
You're under arrest.

779
00:36:31,577 --> 00:36:33,464
Well done, Officer West.

780
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,810
Hi.

781
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:47,125
Look, I'm sorry.

782
00:36:47,215 --> 00:36:49,418
Just, every time I go
to my mother's house,

783
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:51,176
I turn into this person
I don't want to be.

784
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:52,980
Why? Your mom is great.

785
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:55,090
And don't give me the "You don't
really know her" spiel.

786
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:57,461
She has nothing but a deep
and genuine love for you.

787
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,571
So why do you keep
turning your back on her?

788
00:36:59,605 --> 00:37:02,510
It's just all that excess.
I always hated that.

789
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:04,515
I need to make it on my own.

790
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,511
What?

791
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:08,413
Only a rich person would think

792
00:37:08,448 --> 00:37:10,348
turning down money is a noble idea.

793
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:14,119
I wore my brother's
hand-me-downs until I was 15.

794
00:37:14,153 --> 00:37:15,256
My mom worked two jobs,

795
00:37:15,293 --> 00:37:17,287
and so did <i>we</i> once we
reached high school.

796
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,805
So... you think less of me?

797
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:21,068
Are you kidding?

798
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,941
Your mom and I already started
planning the wedding.

799
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,527
California's a no-fault divorce state,

800
00:37:25,564 --> 00:37:27,396
so if you ever felt like
doing me a solid...

801
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:28,905
Mm-hmm.

802
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:34,410
Love your mom while you have her.

803
00:37:34,971 --> 00:37:36,839
Take that money
- and do something good with it.

804
00:37:36,876 --> 00:37:38,157
Like fix your car, maybe?

805
00:37:38,194 --> 00:37:40,261
I was thinking more like
feed the homeless,

806
00:37:40,298 --> 00:37:42,332
but I wouldn't say no to a Porsche.

807
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:43,455
Oh, really?

808
00:37:43,492 --> 00:37:45,758
Or we could just get a chauffeur.

809
00:37:46,074 --> 00:37:47,205
Come on, trust fund.

810
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:55,191
Mm!

811
00:37:56,627 --> 00:37:58,630
Two hours till we're back on shift.

812
00:37:58,664 --> 00:38:00,340
It's gonna be a long day.

813
00:38:00,377 --> 00:38:01,707
Think you can get a power nap in?

814
00:38:01,744 --> 00:38:02,809
Nah.

815
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:04,980
I'm just gonna "Clockwork Orange" it.

816
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:09,441
Hey, come on. Gleason's behind bars.

817
00:38:09,475 --> 00:38:11,176
You gotta feel good about that, right?

818
00:38:11,608 --> 00:38:12,742
Yeah.

819
00:38:13,646 --> 00:38:16,648
But if I wouldn't have pushed
things with my problem spot,

820
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:20,137
if I would have just sat
in the car, like Smitty said,

821
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:22,848
or... or let the ex-cons go
with a warning,

822
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,725
then Gleason wouldn't have run
and he wouldn't have...

823
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:27,002
he wouldn't have dumped the gun,
and that kid would still have a mom.

824
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:28,232
Stop.

825
00:38:28,361 --> 00:38:30,639
What happened was not your fault.

826
00:38:30,726 --> 00:38:33,474
It was Gleason's, and now he's
on the hook for two murders.

827
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,446
He's gonna be locked up forever.

828
00:38:35,527 --> 00:38:37,361
That's all you need
to take away from this.

829
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,606
You got me?

830
00:38:38,643 --> 00:38:39,693
Yeah.

831
00:38:39,738 --> 00:38:41,604
And don't start listening to Smitty.

832
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:43,091
You're not that kind of cop.

833
00:38:43,135 --> 00:38:45,370
Yeah, I'm the kind who'll never
get out of long sleeves.

834
00:38:45,676 --> 00:38:47,451
Mm! Excuse me?

835
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:48,608
Sorry. Your bet.

836
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:50,099
Clearly, <i>you</i> won't, either.

837
00:38:50,241 --> 00:38:51,961
Do you really think Tim's
gonna make me do push-ups

838
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:53,558
after every call?

839
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,160
You know what? On the bright side,

840
00:38:55,223 --> 00:38:57,976
when it's over, I'm gonna have
mad upper-body strength.

841
00:38:59,312 --> 00:39:00,978
Come on.
I'll drop you off at your car.

842
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:03,190
We still got time to shower
<i>and</i> change before roll call.

843
00:39:03,227 --> 00:39:04,669
Let's go.

844
00:39:06,732 --> 00:39:08,366
How's Mejia?

845
00:39:08,442 --> 00:39:09,734
They took him back into surgery,

846
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:11,998
but, um, I think he's gonna be okay.

847
00:39:12,035 --> 00:39:13,505
And did you get a chance
to talk to him?

848
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:14,593
I got the passwords,

849
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,565
and we seized $22 million
in assets from the arms dealer.

850
00:39:17,633 --> 00:39:20,304
And <i>you</i> helped take down
a pretty big operation, John.

851
00:39:20,341 --> 00:39:21,808
Despite the fact
I almost screwed it up.

852
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:25,156
Well, everyone makes a mistake
now and then.

853
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:27,017
Like the one I made yesterday with you?

854
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,787
Look, um...

855
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:32,156
I-I wasn't asking to live with you.

856
00:39:32,243 --> 00:39:33,851
I was, uh...

857
00:39:34,257 --> 00:39:36,194
I was just testing the waters.

858
00:39:36,228 --> 00:39:38,202
And I capsized the boat.

859
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:39,975
Look, Jess...

860
00:39:40,285 --> 00:39:44,455
I am still just figuring out
who I am in this new life.

861
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,202
It hasn't even been a year
since I got divorced,

862
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:51,577
and I got a brand-new job,
entirely new city.

863
00:39:51,728 --> 00:39:54,707
The only thing I know for sure is...

864
00:39:55,615 --> 00:39:58,017
I love spending time with you.

865
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:01,323
And a shoe rack
will add value to my home,

866
00:40:01,368 --> 00:40:02,728
and if you have any more...

867
00:40:02,764 --> 00:40:04,371
great ideas, I'd love to hear them.

868
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,412
Deal.

869
00:40:10,896 --> 00:40:12,359
I gotta go.

870
00:40:16,602 --> 00:40:19,433
Look at you, saving the world,
getting the girl.

871
00:40:19,938 --> 00:40:21,376
Far cry from college,
when all you wanted

872
00:40:21,413 --> 00:40:23,380
was a fake ID and to pass organic chem.

873
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,320
Well, it wasn't <i>all</i> I wanted.

874
00:40:26,763 --> 00:40:28,474
You had your charms.

875
00:40:29,331 --> 00:40:32,500
Hey, um, I wanted to apologize

876
00:40:32,652 --> 00:40:34,630
about that crack about Agent Russo

877
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:37,335
and for assuming
that I know your taste.

878
00:40:37,372 --> 00:40:39,076
I mean, 20 years is a long time.

879
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:41,785
And yet you are exactly
how I remember you.

880
00:40:42,126 --> 00:40:44,368
I'm not sure if that's
a positive or a negative.

881
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:46,172
Positive, for sure. And this has...

882
00:40:47,635 --> 00:40:49,669
This has been great seeing you again

883
00:40:49,706 --> 00:40:52,032
and catching up
and being friends again.

884
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,471
- Mm-hmm.
- And I would love to go

885
00:40:53,506 --> 00:40:54,906
on a double date, meet your husband.

886
00:40:56,342 --> 00:40:57,909
I'm not really married.

887
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,779
- Oh, I-I...
- I mean, technically, I am,

888
00:41:00,813 --> 00:41:03,481
but Simon and I...
we separated over a year ago.

889
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:04,719
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah,

890
00:41:04,756 --> 00:41:06,157
I guess that I keep wearing the ring

891
00:41:06,194 --> 00:41:08,262
so I don't have to have
uncomfortable conversations.

892
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,233
Right. I get it. Um...

893
00:41:10,356 --> 00:41:11,423
And I know the drill.

894
00:41:11,457 --> 00:41:13,608
So if you ever want to just talk, I'm...

895
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:15,261
I'm around.

896
00:41:16,228 --> 00:41:18,107
I might just take you up on that.

897
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:28,404
Lucy! What are you doing here?

898
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:29,774
Uh, sorry. I know it's early.

899
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:31,745
Um, I just wanted to thank you

900
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:34,317
for going out with Tim last night.

901
00:41:34,383 --> 00:41:37,351
Uh, Bordeaux, your favorite wine, right?

902
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:39,311
That wasn't necessary.

903
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:43,869
I hope it wasn't too unbearable.

904
00:41:43,906 --> 00:41:46,162
It was fine. He was... fine.

905
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:49,225
I know he can come off
like this smug hard-ass,

906
00:41:49,262 --> 00:41:52,197
but, you know, deep down, he...
he has a really good heart.

907
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,664
Anyway, I'll go.

908
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,646
But I owe you one. Big time.

909
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:03,122
Hey, can I borrow your, uh...

910
00:42:08,912 --> 00:42:10,548
Short sleeves.

911
00:42:16,323 --> 00:42:17,456
Yes!
