Worried
she's not gonna show?

41
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,711
Oh, no, no. I wouldn't bring
a first date here.

42
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:26,753
No offense.

43
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,713
Oh, none taken.

44
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,089
I am meeting someone,
though.

45
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,465
My, um ‐‐ My TO.

46
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,842
My training officer.

47
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,926
I'm a rookie. LAPD.

48
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,428
You're a rookie?
Yeah.

49
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:36,096
Mid‐life career change.

50
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,056
Oh. Good for you.
Thanks.

51
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,225
You wouldn't happen to see her,
did you,

52
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,185
someone probably just
checking her watch,

53
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,270
looking annoyed?
Maybe.

54
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,521
I‐I don't really
pay attention

55
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,273
to people
sitting at the bar.

56
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:48,734
So, why the change?

57
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,110
Hmm.

58
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,487
Uh, you know, uh,

59
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,072
sometimes life
just gives you a nudge.

60
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,240
For me,
it was a divorce,

61
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,366
my son moving
off to college,

62
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,659
and an ill‐timed trip
to the bank.

63
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,994
Makes sense.

64
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,662
Wife left you,
kid left you.

65
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,289
Nothing like
a gun in hand

66
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,999
to make you
feel powerful again.

67
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,043
No, that's not why
at all.

68
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,296
Are there maybe
some other customers

69
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,589
that could use your help?

70
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,885
You're her.
You're my TO.

71
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,304
Took you long enough.

72
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,138
Wow. Okay.

73
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,181
Why the game?

74
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,432
Wanted to see
if you could play.

75
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,142
So, if it wasn't
about your gun,

76
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,769
why do you want
the badge?

77
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,521
Well, because when people
are having their worst day,

78
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,190
I want to be there,
try to help make it right.

79
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,024
Oh, God,
you're one of those.

80
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:30,525
One of what?
A guardian.

81
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,569
There are two kinds of cops,
Officer Nolan ‐‐

82
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,197
there are Warriors
and Guardians.

83
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:38,033
One's a hunter,
the other's a nurturer.

84
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,410
One is only alive
when they're in the fight.

85
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,288
The other is happy
to clock out after 12.

86
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,790
One is worth my time.

87
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,541
The other is not.

88
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,335
♪ <i>Come back one more time</i> ♪

89
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:51,171
♪ <i>In this cold, empty home</i> ♪

90
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,839
♪ <i>Come back one more time</i> ♪

91
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,132
That went well.

92
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,138
I don't understand.

93
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,349
So, she's a detective,

94
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,433
but she's coming back
to patrol?

95
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,267
Is that allowed?

96
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,769
Well,
it's not unheard of.

97
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:06,645
Actually,
I've never heard of it.

98
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,230
Lucky me.

99
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,731
Well, I've been through
a lot of TO mind games,

100
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,149
and it's really
not that bad.

101
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,734
All you need
to remember is

102
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,153
be absolutely perfect
at all times.
Thanks.

103
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,280
Look, seriously,
you are a great cop.

104
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,199
You just need to keep
being a great cop,

105
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,617
and she'll see that.

106
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,161
Oh, Rachel.

107
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,162
Uh, I'll see you guys
in there.

108
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
Hey!
Hi!

109
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,123
Happy birthday!

110
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:27,499
Thank you!

111
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,917
It's ‐‐
It's your birthday?
Yeah!

112
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,836
And I am spending it
doing what I love ‐‐

113
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,796
picking up
juvenile contact reports.

114
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:34,131
I got your gift.

115
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,383
How do you always find
the perfect thing?

116
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,218
Mm, just six months
of scouring

117
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,137
every used book store
in Los Angeles.

118
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,930
I tracked down a copy of
"Aeronautics Through the Ages."

119
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,306
Sounds like
a page turner.

120
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,016
Well, my grandfather
did the illustrations.

121
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,852
He was obsessed
with planes.

122
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,061
When I was a kid,

123
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,230
we spent every weekend
at local airfields.

124
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,441
Well,
until security crackdowns.

125
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:54,526
Anyway, um,
I should get to work.

126
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,195
We still on for Friday?

127
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,447
Yeah.

128
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,948
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

129
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,324
Happy birthday.

130
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,617
Thanks.

131
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,999
Whatever you're about
to say, don't.

132
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,960
We have a new Training Officer
joining us this morning,

133
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,171
Detective Nyla Harper.

134
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,547
Nyla?

135
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,603
What's up?
You're late for roll call.

136
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,855
Oh, that's still a thing?
Take a seat.

137
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,357
As I was saying,
Detective Harper just completed

138
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,109
four years of undercover work.

139
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,569
She has volunteered to bring

140
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:41,406
her wealth of experience
to the FTO program.

141
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,117
Officer Nolan,
I'm sure you'll learn a lot.

142
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,660
Looking forward to it,
sir.

143
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,538
If you need anything,
ask Lopez and Bradford.

144
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,748
They'll bring you
up to speed.

145
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:50,916
Yes, sir.

146
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,876
Alright, that's it.
Be safe out there.

147
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,005
Hey. Angela Lopez.

148
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,049
Hi.
He's Bradford.

149
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,259
Surprised to see a detective
volunteer as a TO.

150
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,094
Most would see it
as a step backward.

151
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,596
While clearly,
you've never moved forward.

152
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,807
I get the appeal, though ‐‐
surround yourself with kids

153
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,433
who don't know enough
to see through your bull.

154
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,519
Look, solid policing
is anything but bull.

155
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,813
Whereas cops like you spend
so much time over the edge

156
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,689
you don't even know
where the line is.

157
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,107
Don't get your panties
in a bunch, handsome.

158
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,359
I'm not saying
you're not tough.

159
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,153
I'm just saying
you're not <i>me.</i>

160
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,243
I love her so much.

161
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,995
Thank you.
You're welcome.

162
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,914
What's all this?
Our gear.

163
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:36,586
Ticket book?
You're not gonna need that.

164
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,006
Or that. Or this.

165
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,008
Okay, well, Sergeant Grey likes
to see two citations a week.

166
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,927
Grey's not your TO.

167
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,303
Give me an AR‐15

168
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,597
with PVS‐14 night vision
and a laser sight.

169
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,598
You're AR certified?

170
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,641
Card's on file.

171
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,268
Coming up.

172
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,769
You really think
we're gonna need an AR‐15?

173
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,145
Sure hope so.

174
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:57,190
L‐Look, um,
about last night.

175
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,317
I‐I really
don't understand the ruse.

176
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,570
If you wanted to know
why I wanted to be a cop,

177
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,572
you could have just asked me,
and I would have told you.

178
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:04,698
I wanted to see who you were

179
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,366
when you weren't kissing
your new TO's ass.

180
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,827
And I found out
you can't be trusted.

181
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,287
Because
I want to help people?

182
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,371
Because you started
spilling secrets

183
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,747
to a complete stranger.

184
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,250
What if that waitress had
a brother in the Rolling 60s

185
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,002
who would just love to smoke
an off‐duty cop?

186
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,337
I didn't think of that.
Clearly.

187
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,631
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
That won't happen again.

188
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,758
You obviously have
a wealth of experience.

189
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,969
And I'm looking forward
to learning everything
you have to teach.

190
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,053
Oh,
I won't be teaching you.

191
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,638
You're my training officer.

192
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,140
Which earns me
a 5% pay bump.

193
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,350
Whether you learn
or not.

194
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,902
I know you're probably
worrying about

195
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,111
what to get Rachel.

196
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,613
Don't.

197
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,948
You are riding with
the world's best gift‐giver.

198
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,366
So let's start
brainstorming.

199
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,743
What are you thinking about
getting her?

200
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,119
Nothing.

201
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,246
It's her birthday.

202
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,456
We've been dating
for two weeks.

203
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,291
If I get her something,
it'd be weird.

204
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,584
So, you just wished her
happy birthday,

205
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:58,335
and now you're done?

206
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,128
Yep.

207
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,381
Okay.

208
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,054
Maybe I should get her
something small.

209
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,063
Broken taillight.

210
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,022
Which he clearly
can't afford to fix.

211
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,072
Ah, look,
she barely stopped.

212
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,114
She could have caused
an accident.

213
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,532
But she didn't.

214
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,242
Is this why you became a cop,
Five Percent?

215
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:34,079
To harass hard‐working people
just trying to get by?

216
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,247
Doesn't sound
very guardian‐like to me.

217
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,042
No, ma'am, but Sergeant Grey
likes to see 2, 2, and 2 ‐‐

218
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,003
two citations, two misdemeanors,
and two felony arrests a week.

219
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,338
Yeah,
we won't be doing that.

220
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,381
And if he fires us?

221
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,590
I can't get fired.

222
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,883
I have a golden ticket.

223
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,842
Like in "Willy Wonka"?

224
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,345
Like in the LAPD.

225
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,474
It's a reward for policing
above and beyond.

226
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,643
I had my choice ‐‐
any station, any detail.

227
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,353
And you picked this?
Mm‐hmm.

228
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,438
Well, you must have taken down
some heavy hitters.

229
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,482
It's what warriors do,
Officer Nolan.

230
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,651
Which is why we don't
get out of this car

231
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,611
for anything
less than a felony.

232
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:10,073
And when we do step out,
we step out hard and fast.

233
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,700
Strike before they can.

234
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,202
And if you slow me down,
you are done.

235
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,249
Aah!

236
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,085
Are you kidding me?!

237
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,507
Please stop.

238
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,884
Drop the guns now!
Show us your hands!

239
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,219
Okay, okay.

240
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,554
You got 'em?
Yeah.

241
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,972
Let's go.

242
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,600
Police.
Is someone in there?

243
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,609
I‐I don't want trouble.

244
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,278
Are you okay?
I'll move.

245
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,488
I just need my cart.

246
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,157
We're not clearing you out.
We're here to help.

247
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:53,783
We'll take you to a hospital.
You've been hurt.

248
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,160
I'm fine.

249
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,454
I'm fine. Just lea‐‐

250
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,622
Leave me alone.
Okay, um, no problem.

251
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,417
I just need some information
for the report.

252
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,170
No, I got‐‐
I have to go.

253
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,379
At least tell me your name.

254
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,842
Alice.

255
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:14,596
Sheldon.
Alice Sheldon.

256
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,015
Thank you, Alice.

257
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,683
I'll make sure those boys
never hurt you again.

258
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,809
If you need anything...

259
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,653
We were just protecting
our neighborhood.

260
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,490
My ‐‐ My dad said they're
tanking the property values.

261
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,532
She's a human being.

262
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,076
I'm not so sure
about you two.

263
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,727
Maserati. No plates.

264
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,145
Let me guess.

265
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,190
Not worth
getting out of the shop for.

266
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,693
No, this one,
we stop.

267
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,115
A rag around
the steering column

268
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,574
to hide
the broken ignition.

269
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,700
That car is stolen.

270
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,411
<i>Driver in the Maserati,</i>
<i>pull over.</i>

271
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,671
Driver.
Step out of the car.

272
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:32,507
You're hot for a cop.

273
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,801
I know.
Everybody out. Now.

274
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,180
Hands where
I can see them.

275
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,224
Nolan. VIN.

276
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,601
Control, 7‐Adam‐15.

277
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,936
Need you to run
a VIN for me.

278
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,771
Number's 7‐1‐8.

279
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,939
Hey, stay where you are.

280
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,607
Stay where you are!

281
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,653
You're under arrest.

282
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,030
Hey, stop!

283
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:13,840
Get up.

284
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,264
7‐Adam‐15.
In foot pursuit of suspect.

285
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:22,557
7th and Figueroa.

286
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:25,143
Hispanic male, 5'7",
gray shirt, gray jeans.

287
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:27,937
Requesting backup
and airship.

288
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,063
Aah!

289
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,482
Aaaah!

290
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,485
7‐Adam‐15.
Start an RA to 7th and Figueroa.

291
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,154
Suspect down. Broken leg.
Conscious and breathing.

292
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,238
Just stay still.
Help is on the way.

293
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,157
She pushed me.
That bitch pushed me.

294
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:52,236
Come on.

295
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:53,488
Okay, ready.

296
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:55,156
So, what happened?
Gravity.

297
00:11:55,156 --> 00:11:56,741
He says you pushed him.

298
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,076
I know I said I wasn't
gonna teach you anything,
Five Percent,

299
00:11:59,076 --> 00:12:01,329
but, um
here's a lesson.

300
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:02,705
Criminals lie.

301
00:12:04,415 --> 00:12:05,374
She's right.

302
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:06,751
Criminals lie.

303
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:09,045
You really think
she could've pushed him?

304
00:12:09,045 --> 00:12:11,214
I don't know.
With Talia, I never would've...

305
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:12,840
I never would have
considered it,

306
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,010
but Harper has this real
"ends justifies the means" vibe.

307
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,678
Still. Throwing somebody
off a roof

308
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:18,888
in broad daylight
is hardcore.

309
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:20,765
But she has
a golden ticket.

310
00:12:20,765 --> 00:12:22,266
Maybe she thinks
that'll protect her.

311
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:24,268
Wait, a golden ticket
is rarified air.

312
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:25,561
My dad caught a serial killer

313
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:26,813
and a bank crew
in the same shift

314
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,481
and never got
a golden ticket.
Okay.

315
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,609
If you were me,
would you go to Grey?

316
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:34,320
Look, Harper might have
a ticket, but you don't.

317
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,864
You have the responsibility
to inform the watch commander

318
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:38,783
of any potential issues
on the job.

319
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,202
And an allegation
of police brutality

320
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:42,745
would definitely be one.

321
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,583
Excuse me.
May I have a word?

322
00:12:48,751 --> 00:12:50,253
Oh, right on time.

323
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:52,046
I'll come back later.
No. Stay.

324
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,714
This concerns you, too.

325
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:55,508
See, Detective Harper
asked me to review

326
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:56,425
her body‐cam footage.

327
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:00,680
<i>Hey! Stop!</i>

328
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:03,850
<i>Stop! Hey!</i>

329
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,061
<i>Aaaaah!</i>
<i>I told you to stop!</i>

330
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:08,396
Looks conclusive to me.

331
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:09,772
Yes, sir.

332
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:11,816
So I'll forward it
to Internal Affairs with a memo.

333
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:13,693
Hopefully it'll head off
any civil lawsuits

334
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:15,111
that might be
coming your way.

335
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,905
Thank you, sir.
You're welcome.

336
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:20,283
And thank you
for the trust.

337
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:25,413
I'm sorry, sir.

338
00:13:25,413 --> 00:13:27,206
No, you did the right thing
coming to me.

339
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,708
I‐I‐It's not
that I don't trust her.

340
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:30,501
No, you shouldn't
trust her.

341
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:33,337
So, word is Detective Harper
spent the last four years

342
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:37,341
doing "controlled deliveries"
in the LAPD‐DEA task force.

343
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:38,718
I'm not familiar
with the term.

344
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:41,137
An undercover agent
poses as a drug smuggler.

345
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:43,889
Goes into Mexico,
negotiates with the cartel.

346
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,767
Guarantees delivery of dope
into the U. S.

347
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,269
with their own lives.

348
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:51,188
And then they actually smuggle
the dope over the border,

349
00:13:51,188 --> 00:13:53,107
planting micro trackers
in it.

350
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:54,483
See, and then
once it's distributed,

351
00:13:54,483 --> 00:13:55,735
SWAT moves in,

352
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,194
arrests everyone
that touched it.

353
00:13:57,194 --> 00:13:58,571
And then
she goes back to Mexico

354
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,989
and starts the whole thing
over again.

355
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:01,240
But only now,

356
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,034
the cartel is looking for
someone to blame,

357
00:14:03,034 --> 00:14:05,411
with blow torches,
power tools, you know.

358
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,912
Explains the attitude.

359
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,998
She spent
the last four years

360
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:12,043
neck‐deep in paranoia
and adrenaline,

361
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:13,794
lying every time
she opened her mouth,

362
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:16,005
striking out
at any sign of aggression.

363
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,673
Now, don't get me wrong ‐‐

364
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:19,884
I have the utmost respect
for her service,

365
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:22,345
but transitioning
back into a uniform?

366
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:23,846
That's gonna be a bitch.

367
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:29,060
So, you made her my TO?

368
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,770
I didn't have much say
in that matter.

369
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,482
She would eat
a 25‐year‐old recruit alive.

370
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:35,775
At least
you stand a chance.

371
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,193
Thank you,

372
00:14:37,193 --> 00:14:39,195
but I‐I think I would stand
a much better chance

373
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:41,280
if I knew why she wanted
to be here in the first place.

374
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,200
When you find out,
let me know.

375
00:14:47,703 --> 00:14:48,829
What are you doing?

376
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:51,248
Raiding
the lost and found.

377
00:14:51,248 --> 00:14:54,418
Why?
For Alice.

378
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:56,587
The transient those kids
were paintballing.

379
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:58,673
I ran her name.

380
00:14:58,673 --> 00:15:01,425
10 years ago, she was on
the tenure track at UCLA,

381
00:15:01,425 --> 00:15:02,551
teaching chemistry.

382
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:04,053
Had a house,
a couple dogs,

383
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:05,846
then everything
fell apart.

384
00:15:05,846 --> 00:15:08,015
That's awful.

385
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:10,810
But, I mean, we interact
with homeless every day.

386
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,977
You don't bring them
care packages.

387
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,813
Those kids
took away her dignity,

388
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:14,980
tortured her for fun.

389
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,401
She deserves
a little compassion.

390
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:21,070
Look, I, uh, have a couple
sweatshirts in my car.

391
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,530
We can grab them
on the way out.

392
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,532
Sounds good.

393
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:28,869
Look, it's a bad idea.

394
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:29,995
No, it's not.

395
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:31,956
Do you even know
if Rachel likes baseball?

396
00:15:31,956 --> 00:15:33,457
Who doesn't like
baseball?

397
00:15:33,457 --> 00:15:35,209
It's America's pastime.
In the '30s.

398
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:36,502
Rachel is not into sports.

399
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,504
Try to think of something
that's <i>for</i> her.

400
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,131
Smile!

401
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:41,132
Thank God.

402
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:42,758
Uh, we got a call
about an assault?

403
00:15:42,758 --> 00:15:44,468
They just barged in
and started taking pictures.

404
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:46,721
My son is very sick.

405
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:47,930
Good! Yay!
...what you're doing.

406
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,181
Oh, that's awesome!
Ready?

407
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,100
Hey,
what's going on in here?
Just a second.

408
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,101
Step out in the hallway
right now.

409
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:53,227
Both of you.

410
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:57,064
What's the problem,
Officer?

411
00:15:57,064 --> 00:15:59,525
They broke into my son's room
and started posing.

412
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,901
"Broke in"
is an exaggeration.

413
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:02,820
You told the nurse
you were his sister.

414
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,405
I didn't say
I was <i>his</i> sister.

415
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:05,406
I said I was <i>a</i> sister.

416
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,032
We're just trying to help.

417
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,284
Bella saw a Facebook post

418
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:10,119
about little Cody
and his fight against cancer.

419
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,288
She has a half a million
followers on social media.

420
00:16:12,288 --> 00:16:14,582
I was just trying to draw
attention to his plight.

421
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:15,499
Doesn't that count
for something?

422
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:16,792
Not without permission.

423
00:16:16,792 --> 00:16:18,377
You're under arrest
for trespassing

424
00:16:18,377 --> 00:16:20,629
and photographing a minor
without a parent's consent.

425
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:22,673
I told you this was a bad idea.

426
00:16:22,673 --> 00:16:25,259
You need more empathy posts.
Your follows are stagnant.

427
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,136
The consultant told us
to find a sick kid ‐‐
He's not a consultant.

428
00:16:27,136 --> 00:16:29,972
He's your cousin,
and he still lives with his mom!

429
00:16:29,972 --> 00:16:31,182
He's got his finger
on the pulse.
Okay, enough.

430
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:32,850
Alright, I am really sorry
that this happened.

431
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,435
We will come back
and get your statement.

432
00:16:34,435 --> 00:16:36,729
Honey,
get back in bed.

433
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,449
Can't we get in there?
Just one picture.

434
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:49,492
No!
No!
No!

435
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,539
Looks like she moved on.

436
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:58,250
She left
some stuff behind.

437
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,419
Hey, you know where
the woman who was attacked went?

438
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,338
Have you seen her?

439
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:04,048
Whose stuff
is this here?

440
00:17:07,718 --> 00:17:09,678
What's that?

441
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:11,639
I don't know, but Alice
was trying to protect it.

442
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:13,057
Could it be her daughter?

443
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:14,391
No, she didn't have kids.

444
00:17:15,726 --> 00:17:17,645
Control,
I need you to run a name.

445
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:19,897
Katrin Arnoux.

446
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:21,106
<i>I show a Katrin Arnoux</i>

447
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,150
<i>as the victim of</i>
<i>a hit‐and‐run in 2009.</i>

448
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,777
Homicide?

449
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,821
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>Victim was left paralyzed.</i>

450
00:17:26,821 --> 00:17:28,197
Any suspects?

451
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:29,657
<i>Negative.</i>

452
00:17:29,657 --> 00:17:30,908
<i>Would you like</i>
<i>contact information</i>

453
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:32,284
<i>on the investigating</i>
<i>detective?</i>

454
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:34,328
Yeah.
Send it to the box.

455
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:36,163
Wait,
you don't think that...

456
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,581
10 years ago,

457
00:17:37,581 --> 00:17:39,834
this girl was paralyzed
by a hit‐and‐run driver.

458
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,168
And right after,

459
00:17:41,168 --> 00:17:43,337
Alice fell apart,
ended up here.

460
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:44,588
Sure sounds like guilt
to me.

461
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:45,923
We gotta find her.

462
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:47,466
She's a fugitive.

463
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:54,501
Look, I only went to Grey

464
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:55,669
because you refused
to deal with me.

465
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:57,713
You could have shown me
your body‐cam footage on scene.

466
00:17:57,713 --> 00:17:59,465
I don't answer to you,
Five Percent.

467
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:00,549
No, you don't.

468
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:01,967
But if you are committed

469
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:04,386
to making this
an antagonistic relationship,

470
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:06,013
don't expect me
to roll over and take it.

471
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:15,189
Where ‐‐

472
00:18:15,189 --> 00:18:16,774
Where is it?!

473
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:21,904
Looking for this?

474
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:24,740
That's mine!
Give it!

475
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,283
Who is she?

476
00:18:27,701 --> 00:18:29,119
She's, um...

477
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:33,791
It's no one.
I j‐‐

478
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,876
It's not anyone.

479
00:18:35,876 --> 00:18:37,670
It just ‐‐ I like it.

480
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,546
Her name
is Katrin Arnoux.

481
00:18:39,546 --> 00:18:42,591
N‐N‐No.

482
00:18:42,591 --> 00:18:46,178
No. No.

483
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:48,430
But I think
you know that.

484
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,140
What happened 10 years ago,
Alice?

485
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:54,561
Nothing. Nothing.

486
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:58,023
Nothing. I have to go.

487
00:18:58,023 --> 00:19:00,484
I think something did.

488
00:19:00,484 --> 00:19:01,902
Something that
destroyed your life.

489
00:19:01,902 --> 00:19:03,654
N‐N‐No.

490
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:05,489
N‐No, no, no.

491
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:07,574
It was late.
Maybe you were tired.

492
00:19:07,574 --> 00:19:10,911
You never saw her.

493
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:12,705
You tried to convince yourself
it was an animal,

494
00:19:12,705 --> 00:19:14,498
but then you saw
the news.

495
00:19:14,498 --> 00:19:18,460
And you tried to move on,
but it haunted you.

496
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,130
Poisoned every part of your life
until you ended up here.

497
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:25,551
I don't know
what you're talking about.

498
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:28,679
You do.

499
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,557
And I think some part of you
is relieved it's finally out.

500
00:19:34,643 --> 00:19:36,895
I never meant
to hurt anybody.

501
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:42,484
I'm sorry,
but you're under arrest.

502
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,283
Okay. Okay.

503
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,628
Son of a bitch.

504
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:02,921
What?

505
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:15,726
Who is he?
Corkscrew.

506
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:16,769
I knew him in Arizona.

507
00:20:16,769 --> 00:20:18,395
If he's in LA,
something's up.

508
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:19,646
You met him
when you were undercover?

509
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:23,901
What are you do‐‐
What are you...?

510
00:20:23,901 --> 00:20:25,110
What are you doing?

511
00:20:30,824 --> 00:20:32,534
Um...

512
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:36,997
You know,
you're not supposed to

513
00:20:36,997 --> 00:20:38,165
take off your uniform
on shift.

514
00:20:38,165 --> 00:20:39,917
You gonna
run and tell Grey?

515
00:20:39,917 --> 00:20:41,043
Just forget Grey.

516
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:43,378
Just tell me
what's going on.

517
00:20:43,378 --> 00:20:45,130
I'm your only backup
out here.

518
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,633
Corkscrew knew me as a tweaker
named Crystal.

519
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:50,010
If I play it right,
he'll tell me why he's in town.

520
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,058
Only come in
if I need you.

521
00:20:56,934 --> 00:20:58,477
How will I know?

522
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:00,771
You'll know.

523
00:21:34,805 --> 00:21:36,056
Crystal?

524
00:21:36,932 --> 00:21:38,141
These are my clothes.

525
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:39,893
Hey, hey, hey.
It's me.

526
00:21:41,895 --> 00:21:43,522
Dude. Corkscrew.

527
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:47,484
Dude,
what are you doing here?!

528
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:56,577
Can we get hi‐res copies
of these?

529
00:21:56,577 --> 00:21:58,412
No.

530
00:21:58,412 --> 00:22:00,247
How about I take Rachel
to the shooting range?

531
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:01,498
Again, that is something
you would like.

532
00:22:01,498 --> 00:22:03,375
You got to get something
for her.

533
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,252
I see couples at
the shooting range all the time.

534
00:22:05,252 --> 00:22:06,128
All the time?

535
00:22:06,128 --> 00:22:07,129
Okay, some of the time.

536
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:08,755
I think
it's a great idea.

537
00:22:08,755 --> 00:22:09,882
You could do
a whole Insta story.

538
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:11,258
We can help.

539
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:13,594
An un‐boxing video
for the gun.

540
00:22:13,594 --> 00:22:15,220
You posing
in the outfits.

541
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,972
There are no outfits.

542
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:20,809
It's Nolan.

543
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:22,352
So, answer it.

544
00:22:22,352 --> 00:22:24,271
Why, 'cause you want intel
on the new TO?

545
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:27,065
Or don't answer it.
Suit yourself.

546
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:29,359
Hey, you're on speaker.
What's up?

547
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:31,570
Hypothetically, is it worse

548
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,156
to disobey a direct order
from your TO

549
00:22:34,156 --> 00:22:36,325
or to stand by
and watch while they're killed?

550
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:38,785
Depends on the TO.

551
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:41,413
Look, disobeying a direct order
is a serious offense.

552
00:22:41,413 --> 00:22:42,706
So really think about it
before you do it.

553
00:22:42,706 --> 00:22:44,041
What's going on?

554
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,460
I'll let you know
when I figure it out.

555
00:22:49,254 --> 00:22:50,797
Okay, so, look.

556
00:22:50,797 --> 00:22:52,341
I‐I need cash.

557
00:22:52,341 --> 00:22:53,467
You know, times is hard.

558
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:54,968
A guy like you's
in town.

559
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:56,553
Something big
must be going on.

560
00:22:56,553 --> 00:22:57,596
I want in.

561
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:59,181
Forget it.

562
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:00,515
No, hey, look!
I'm a great lookout.

563
00:23:00,515 --> 00:23:01,767
I‐It'd be like
old times!

564
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:02,976
Hey, the last time
you were supposed to help out,

565
00:23:02,976 --> 00:23:04,186
you flaked!

566
00:23:04,186 --> 00:23:05,479
I almost got pinched.

567
00:23:05,479 --> 00:23:07,522
A buddy of mine's
doing five years.

568
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:09,066
O‐Okay, but that ‐‐ b‐but that's
not my fault, though.

569
00:23:10,943 --> 00:23:11,818
Are you saying
it's <i>mine?</i>

570
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:13,695
You junkie bitch!

571
00:23:22,704 --> 00:23:24,247
Hands where
I can see them!

572
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:25,707
Uh, uh, this crazy bitch
attacked me.

573
00:23:25,707 --> 00:23:27,125
Turn around.
Put your hands on the wall.

574
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,627
Spread your feet.

575
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:30,003
Ma'am, I need you
to do the same thing.

576
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:33,924
Let him go. Arrest me.

577
00:23:36,301 --> 00:23:38,762
Ma'am,
you're under arrest.

578
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:41,765
Come on.
Give me your hand.

579
00:23:44,587 --> 00:23:46,756
I'm telling you,
she started it.

580
00:23:47,056 --> 00:23:48,015
Oh, you can tell
just by looking at her,

581
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:49,633
that lady is trouble.

582
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:51,067
How long
have you known her?

583
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:52,319
I never seen her before.

584
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:54,321
Why? What did she say?
Nothing.

585
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,864
Just a routine question.

586
00:23:55,864 --> 00:23:58,408
I just need your ID
and your mobile number,

587
00:23:58,408 --> 00:23:59,784
and I can get
out of your hair.

588
00:23:59,784 --> 00:24:01,369
Yeah, it's, uh ‐‐
It's 480 ‐‐

589
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:02,746
Sorry, I need to get it
off your actual phone.

590
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:03,747
Procedure.

591
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:04,873
Okay.

592
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,375
Perfect.

593
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,835
Thank you.

594
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:13,298
Thanks.

595
00:24:15,675 --> 00:24:16,593
Alright,
we're far enough away.

596
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:17,969
Pull over and let me out.

597
00:24:17,969 --> 00:24:19,346
Not until you answer
a couple of questions.

598
00:24:19,346 --> 00:24:20,096
What did Corkscrew say?

599
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:21,306
Pull over!

600
00:24:21,306 --> 00:24:22,349
What's he doing in LA?

601
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:25,268
I am your TO.
Pull over now!

602
00:24:25,268 --> 00:24:26,436
Yeah, you know what?

603
00:24:26,436 --> 00:24:27,812
You really
don't act like it.

604
00:24:27,812 --> 00:24:29,439
You know,
I'd tell you what he said,

605
00:24:29,439 --> 00:24:31,983
but you'd probably just blab it
to some random waitress.

606
00:24:31,983 --> 00:24:34,110
Okay, how am I
the untrustworthy one here?

607
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:36,238
Everything you have
said to me so far

608
00:24:36,238 --> 00:24:37,656
is either a lie
or an evasion.

609
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:39,157
Not lying
when I say I hate you.

610
00:24:39,157 --> 00:24:41,159
You know, I don't even think
you can help it anymore.

611
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:42,869
I don't think lying
is second nature to you.

612
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:45,664
I think it's first.
It's who you are.

613
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:48,041
Pull over right now,
Five Percent,

614
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,626
or I will have your badge.

615
00:24:51,127 --> 00:24:52,546
Pretty sure
I'm getting fired.

616
00:24:52,546 --> 00:24:53,922
You're pretty sure?

617
00:24:53,922 --> 00:24:56,633
Dude, you are
100% getting fired.

618
00:24:58,009 --> 00:24:58,802
But you got
to let her out.

619
00:24:58,802 --> 00:25:00,303
I can't stand down now.

620
00:25:00,303 --> 00:25:01,471
I've gone too far.

621
00:25:01,471 --> 00:25:02,722
You can't keep her
in there forever.

622
00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:03,848
What's your plan?

623
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:05,267
Dessert.

624
00:25:07,227 --> 00:25:08,603
How did you do that?

625
00:25:08,603 --> 00:25:10,397
The shop only opens
from the outside.

626
00:25:10,397 --> 00:25:11,856
Enjoy your cupcake

627
00:25:11,856 --> 00:25:13,400
'cause it's the last thing
you'll eat as a cop.

628
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:16,736
I got Corkscrew's
mobile number.

629
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:18,697
We can track his contacts
and his movements.

630
00:25:19,489 --> 00:25:20,532
Still fired?

631
00:25:22,993 --> 00:25:25,328
Not today.

632
00:25:25,328 --> 00:25:27,205
Definitely tomorrow.

633
00:25:32,002 --> 00:25:33,795
Control, I need
to monitor a cellphone.

634
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:35,255
What is she wearing?

635
00:25:35,255 --> 00:25:37,966
More importantly,
what's she doing in our house?

636
00:25:37,966 --> 00:25:39,384
Detectives don't go back
to patrol.

637
00:25:39,384 --> 00:25:40,677
It's got to be a demotion.

638
00:25:40,677 --> 00:25:42,846
Jackson heard
she has a golden ticket.

639
00:25:42,846 --> 00:25:45,557
She had her pick of assignments,
and she chose this?

640
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:46,975
Nah. Something wonky's
going on.

641
00:25:52,772 --> 00:25:53,732
That's really her?

642
00:25:53,732 --> 00:25:55,108
We think so.

643
00:25:57,402 --> 00:26:00,488
She looks so...
so pathetic.

644
00:26:00,488 --> 00:26:01,656
As far as we can tell,

645
00:26:01,656 --> 00:26:03,033
her life fell apart
after she hit you.

646
00:26:03,033 --> 00:26:04,451
It's almost impossible
for a transient

647
00:26:04,451 --> 00:26:05,910
to hang on
to anything.

648
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,913
Belongings are stolen,
confiscated by the city.

649
00:26:08,913 --> 00:26:11,249
But she held on
to your picture for 10 years

650
00:26:11,249 --> 00:26:13,793
in conditions
worse than prison.

651
00:26:13,793 --> 00:26:15,629
She never
let herself forget.

652
00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:19,174
Even for a moment.

653
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:21,426
What are you saying?

654
00:26:21,426 --> 00:26:23,720
She's suffered enough?

655
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,805
Back in the day,
if she was arrested,

656
00:26:25,805 --> 00:26:27,390
she would have gotten
three years in prison.

657
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,850
Maybe five.

658
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,352
Instead,
she's been punishing herself

659
00:26:30,352 --> 00:26:32,437
for the last decade.

660
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:33,772
She ran
but didn't escape.

661
00:26:33,772 --> 00:26:36,941
I'll never run again,
Officer Lopez.

662
00:26:38,485 --> 00:26:41,696
Yes, ma'am.
I apologize.

663
00:26:41,696 --> 00:26:44,407
I wasn't trying to excuse
what she did to you.

664
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:45,408
Only ‐‐

665
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:47,577
Only what?

666
00:26:47,577 --> 00:26:51,581
She destroyed
a part of me.

667
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:53,416
And you have the nerve
to plead her case?

668
00:27:00,548 --> 00:27:01,841
She was out of line.

669
00:27:01,841 --> 00:27:03,301
No, she's right.

670
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:05,220
I overstepped.

671
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,056
This is Ross Tegan,
AKA Corkscrew.

672
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:10,392
He operates as a straw buyer
out of Arizona,

673
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:12,936
transporting unlicensed weapons
into California

674
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:15,105
where they end up
on our streets.

675
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:16,564
Thanks to Detective Harper,

676
00:27:16,564 --> 00:27:18,525
we now know the location
of his next sale.

677
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:19,567
Detective?

678
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:20,860
He may not look like much,

679
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,320
but Corkscrew
is putting guns in the hands

680
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,072
of the most dangerous gangs
in the city.

681
00:27:24,072 --> 00:27:25,990
Cut off his pipeline,
our streets get safer,

682
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:27,117
and our jobs get easier.

683
00:27:27,117 --> 00:27:28,535
So we'll observe
the exchange

684
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:30,495
from a van
across the street.

685
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:31,871
As soon as the buy
takes place,

686
00:27:31,871 --> 00:27:33,415
SWAT will move in
to make the arrest.

687
00:27:33,415 --> 00:27:34,749
What about me?

688
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:36,751
So, you and Nolan
will secure the perimeter

689
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:38,169
with Bradford and Chen.

690
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:40,088
Make sure we don't get
any nasty surprises.

691
00:27:40,088 --> 00:27:41,714
So, it's my bust,

692
00:27:41,714 --> 00:27:42,966
but you want me
to wait outside?

693
00:27:42,966 --> 00:27:46,052
That's exactly what I want,
Detective Harper.

694
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:47,345
Is that gonna be a problem?

695
00:27:49,597 --> 00:27:50,765
No, sir.

696
00:27:50,765 --> 00:27:51,933
Good.

697
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:54,227
Gear up.

698
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,773
Hang back, Nolan.

699
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,362
You need to watch
your back.

700
00:28:04,362 --> 00:28:05,697
Oh, I'll be miles
from the action.

701
00:28:05,697 --> 00:28:06,823
I mean with Harper.

702
00:28:06,823 --> 00:28:08,825
Now, Grey's put you
in a bad position.

703
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:10,743
She's a land mine
waiting to go off.

704
00:28:10,743 --> 00:28:13,288
So if you find yourself
in a jam, text Officer Chen.

705
00:28:13,288 --> 00:28:14,038
We'll be there.

706
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:16,666
Thank you.

707
00:28:16,666 --> 00:28:17,917
Don't go
all emotional on me.

708
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:19,461
Training rookies
is a sacred duty,

709
00:28:19,461 --> 00:28:21,254
and it bothers me when cops
don't treat it that way.

710
00:28:26,468 --> 00:28:28,344
Just be safe.
Let's go, Chen.

711
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,989
<i>Nice.</i>

712
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:49,824
<i>No serial numbers?</i>

713
00:28:49,824 --> 00:28:50,783
<i>Yeah.</i>

714
00:28:50,783 --> 00:28:53,453
<i>And they're $250 apiece?</i>

715
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:55,163
<i>That's the deal.</i>

716
00:28:55,163 --> 00:28:58,082
<i>Can you get 100 more?</i>

717
00:28:58,082 --> 00:28:59,751
<i>Sure.</i>

718
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:02,045
<i>I got 'em close by,</i>
<i>as long as you got the cash.</i>

719
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:03,755
<i>I'll text my guy.</i>

720
00:29:03,755 --> 00:29:05,340
<i>They're upping the buy.</i>
<i>Hold position.</i>

721
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,633
Who's the buyer?

722
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:08,343
Most likely, it's one of
two local arms dealers ‐‐

723
00:29:08,343 --> 00:29:09,677
Osito or Brooker.

724
00:29:09,677 --> 00:29:11,137
Osito.
The Teddy Bear?

725
00:29:11,137 --> 00:29:12,138
It's his nickname.

726
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:13,890
I assume
it's meant to be ironic.

727
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,183
Between those two guys,

728
00:29:15,183 --> 00:29:17,810
they provide 60% of the guns
from here to Fresno.

729
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,145
Sounds like
firsthand knowledge.

730
00:29:19,145 --> 00:29:21,314
You work undercover on that
before the task force?

731
00:29:21,981 --> 00:29:22,941
You've been doing
your homework.

732
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:24,526
Need to know
who I'm riding with.
Hmm.

733
00:29:25,818 --> 00:29:26,819
And...?

734
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:29,822
Don't you think
you know me now?

735
00:29:29,822 --> 00:29:31,824
Oh, I don't think
even you know you.

736
00:29:33,493 --> 00:29:35,453
Whatever.
That's a bunch of crap.

737
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:37,413
Ever considered therapy?

738
00:29:37,413 --> 00:29:39,415
What makes you think
I'm not already in therapy?

739
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,834
You ever thought about
more therapy?

740
00:29:43,336 --> 00:29:44,879
You hate every gift idea
I pitch.

741
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:47,298
Because they're all
things <i>you</i> want.

742
00:29:47,298 --> 00:29:48,466
It's not just guy stuff.

743
00:29:48,466 --> 00:29:49,968
Isabel loved going
to the shooting range.

744
00:29:49,968 --> 00:29:50,969
Isabel was a cop.

745
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:52,303
You're basically
the same person.

746
00:29:52,303 --> 00:29:54,847
Rachel
has different interests.

747
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:56,057
So, what you're saying is

748
00:29:56,057 --> 00:29:57,517
I should stop coming up
with my own ideas

749
00:29:57,517 --> 00:29:58,268
and just listen to you?

750
00:29:58,268 --> 00:30:00,270
Basically.

751
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,479
<i>Look, man,</i>
<i>is the money coming or not?</i>

752
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:03,022
<i>He'll be here.</i>

753
00:30:03,022 --> 00:30:04,315
<i>This is taking too long.</i>

754
00:30:04,315 --> 00:30:07,068
<i>If Osito wants more,</i>
<i>set up another buy.</i>

755
00:30:07,068 --> 00:30:08,611
<i>Alright, deal is done.</i>
<i>Moving in.</i>

756
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:10,071
<i>Perimeter units,</i>
<i>lock down all traffic.</i>

757
00:30:10,071 --> 00:30:11,656
What? No. No.

758
00:30:12,782 --> 00:30:14,659
Hold that order.
Stay in position.

759
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:16,244
<i>Who the hell is this?!</i>
Harper.

760
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:17,829
Osito is a must‐catch.

761
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:19,414
If we roll up on these guys now,
we will spook him,

762
00:30:19,414 --> 00:30:22,041
<i>He's not coming, and we can't</i>
<i>risk losing these two.</i>

763
00:30:22,041 --> 00:30:24,460
Yeah, but ‐‐
<i>Detective Harper,</i>
<i>this is not your call.</i>

764
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,754
<i>Respect the chain of command</i>
<i>and your fellow officers,</i>

765
00:30:26,754 --> 00:30:29,257
<i>or I will fire you,</i>
<i>golden ticket or not.</i>

766
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:30,758
<i>Team one, move in.</i>

767
00:30:33,219 --> 00:30:34,971
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
We're on perimeter.

768
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:36,681
I am not gonna let these guys
blow my operation.

769
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,391
It is blown!

770
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:40,393
The only thing you're gonna
accomplish charging in there

771
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:42,145
is having Grey fire you.

772
00:30:42,145 --> 00:30:45,565
And while I would <i>love</i>
to be rid of you,

773
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:48,192
I am positive
you are here for a reason.

774
00:30:48,192 --> 00:30:50,194
That golden ticket could have
gotten you any detail anywhere.

775
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:51,988
You picked this.

776
00:30:51,988 --> 00:30:54,907
So I have to believe
that reason is important ‐‐

777
00:30:54,907 --> 00:30:57,869
too important to blow it
because of a bruised ego.

778
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:03,333
Man #1: <i>Hands up!</i>
<i>Don't move! Don't move!</i>

779
00:31:04,542 --> 00:31:06,127
<i>Do not move!</i>

780
00:31:06,127 --> 00:31:07,378
Man #2: <i>Put your hands</i>
<i>behind your back.</i>

781
00:31:07,378 --> 00:31:09,172
<i>Hold on.</i>
<i>Keep still, keep still,</i>
<i>keep still.</i>

782
00:31:09,172 --> 00:31:10,632
Look, if you're expecting
a thank you ‐‐

783
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:12,216
Oh, I know
better than that.

784
00:31:15,762 --> 00:31:18,431
Man #1: Hands on the car!

785
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:21,851
Man #2: Keep your hands up.

786
00:31:21,851 --> 00:31:23,061
This one's clean.

787
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:27,940
Did you see that?

788
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,567
What?

789
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:31,611
That blue Mustang
just made a U‐turn.

790
00:31:31,611 --> 00:31:33,237
That driver looked scared.

791
00:31:33,237 --> 00:31:35,573
That could be
Osito bringing the money.

792
00:31:35,573 --> 00:31:37,116
Or it could be
some random guy

793
00:31:37,116 --> 00:31:38,868
that realized he left his phone
at the store.

794
00:31:38,868 --> 00:31:40,536
No, the look
on that driver's face,

795
00:31:40,536 --> 00:31:41,996
when he saw the cops ‐‐
that's our guy.

796
00:31:41,996 --> 00:31:43,873
What did he look like?
Hispanic, mid‐30s,

797
00:31:43,873 --> 00:31:45,917
full face, brown hair,
scar over his left eye.

798
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:47,293
That's Osito.

799
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:48,878
Don't call it in.

800
00:31:48,878 --> 00:31:50,338
SWAT already has their bust.

801
00:31:50,338 --> 00:31:51,923
This guy is mine.

802
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:03,119
They're on Osito, but Harper's
enforcing radio silence.

803
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,871
Tell me he invited you
to track his phone.
Yep.

804
00:32:04,971 --> 00:32:07,390
7‐Adam‐19.
We're Code 4 on the scene.

805
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,850
Breaking down
the perimeter.

806
00:32:12,478 --> 00:32:15,315
Where is he headed?
He can't live here.

807
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:17,066
With any luck, he's leading us
to his home base.

808
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,776
I'd feel a lot better
with backup.

809
00:32:18,776 --> 00:32:20,612
Nah,
that's too conspicuous.

810
00:32:20,612 --> 00:32:22,322
Long as he doesn't know
we're following him,

811
00:32:22,322 --> 00:32:23,948
there's no telling
where he might lead us.

812
00:32:23,948 --> 00:32:25,909
You are aware
we're in a black and white?

813
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:28,578
I know.

814
00:32:53,144 --> 00:32:55,063
So, what now?

815
00:33:01,361 --> 00:33:03,863
It's perfect.

816
00:33:03,863 --> 00:33:07,742
There's only one way in...
or out.

817
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,168
7‐Adam‐15.

818
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:19,712
We got a 417
at Diamond Lock Storage.

819
00:33:19,712 --> 00:33:21,714
19901 Jefferson Boulevard.

820
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:23,466
Requesting backup and airship.
Code 2 High.

821
00:33:23,466 --> 00:33:24,592
Feel better?

822
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:26,177
No.

823
00:33:27,345 --> 00:33:28,471
Let's go.

824
00:33:57,375 --> 00:33:59,210
Don't move.

825
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,379
Lay down
flat on your stomach.

826
00:34:01,379 --> 00:34:03,423
Hands out to your sides,
palms up.

827
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:19,355
Ready?

828
00:34:37,874 --> 00:34:39,417
LAPD!

829
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:46,215
Malfunction!

830
00:34:46,215 --> 00:34:47,091
Get covered.

831
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,949
Covering! Covering!
Moving in.

832
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,829
Get up! Get up!

833
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:22,919
Hey, let's go! Let's go!

834
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:24,337
Are you okay?
The vest caught it.

835
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,798
Looks like you've got a little
warrior in you, after all.

836
00:35:26,798 --> 00:35:28,091
And you've got
a little guardian.

837
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:29,675
Hey, watch your mouth.

838
00:35:35,515 --> 00:35:37,225
Osito!

839
00:35:37,225 --> 00:35:38,518
It's over!

840
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:39,936
Put your weapons down

841
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:41,396
and come out
with your hands high.

842
00:35:49,737 --> 00:35:50,905
Hands on the car!

843
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:54,492
Turn around!
Get down on your knees!

844
00:35:54,492 --> 00:35:55,660
Hands behind your head!

845
00:35:56,411 --> 00:35:57,995
Got him.

846
00:36:03,459 --> 00:36:05,920
Now, doesn't that
make it all worthwhile?

847
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,713
No.

848
00:36:07,713 --> 00:36:09,215
But it helps.

849
00:36:14,053 --> 00:36:16,097
Protect and serve.

850
00:36:16,097 --> 00:36:17,598
You can't throw a dead cat
around you without...

851
00:36:17,598 --> 00:36:19,267
What do you think?

852
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:20,935
That I'm glad he's not
yelling at me like that?

853
00:36:29,444 --> 00:36:31,320
Say it.

854
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,865
I'm sorry that my recklessness
put you in jeopardy.

855
00:36:33,865 --> 00:36:36,033
My job is to train you,

856
00:36:36,033 --> 00:36:38,035
not to chase after
my own windmills.

857
00:36:38,035 --> 00:36:38,870
And?

858
00:36:41,289 --> 00:36:43,791
If you would like
to file a formal complaint,

859
00:36:43,791 --> 00:36:46,169
I will not hold it against you
in any way.

860
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:49,547
No, I'm good.

861
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:55,720
But when you're ready,

862
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,638
I'd like you to tell me
why you're here.

863
00:36:57,638 --> 00:36:59,682
I wouldn't
hold your breath.

864
00:36:59,682 --> 00:37:02,268
And for the record,

865
00:37:02,268 --> 00:37:04,187
technically, Five Percent
should be <i>your</i> nickname.

866
00:37:04,187 --> 00:37:05,188
Is that it?

867
00:37:05,188 --> 00:37:06,731
Yes. No.

868
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:11,194
Have a nice evening.

869
00:37:19,243 --> 00:37:20,870
You always
have to push it.

870
00:37:27,502 --> 00:37:29,003
Ms. Arnoux.

871
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:31,130
Thank you for coming in.

872
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,257
I didn't like
the way we left it.

873
00:37:33,257 --> 00:37:35,259
I shouldn't have
unloaded on you like that.

874
00:37:35,259 --> 00:37:37,553
I was completely
in the wrong.

875
00:37:37,553 --> 00:37:41,098
I made your situation about me,
my own issues.

876
00:37:41,098 --> 00:37:43,059
It was insensitive,
and I'm sorry.

877
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:44,852
If there's
anything I can do

878
00:37:44,852 --> 00:37:46,938
to help you through
this process, I'm here.

879
00:37:46,938 --> 00:37:48,481
Your own issues?

880
00:37:51,108 --> 00:37:54,070
I got into a fight with
a boyfriend in high school.

881
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,447
We were at a party.

882
00:37:56,447 --> 00:37:59,283
I left.

883
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:01,744
He got drunk
and flipped his car.

884
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:07,375
It was a closed casket.

885
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:10,253
After that,
I went into a dark place,

886
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:13,047
and I guess Alice's guilt
just triggered something in me.

887
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:20,346
Really, if you need anything,
here's my card.

888
00:38:21,305 --> 00:38:22,723
Wait.

889
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,856
When it happened,

890
00:38:30,856 --> 00:38:33,776
I thought she had taken
everything from me.

891
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:38,864
But the truth is
my life is amazing.

892
00:38:38,864 --> 00:38:42,743
I have a husband who I met
at physical therapy

893
00:38:42,743 --> 00:38:48,791
and two kids
who are my whole world.

894
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,876
I've gained so much more
than I've lost.

895
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:54,463
Can I tell them that ‐‐
the DA?

896
00:38:54,463 --> 00:38:56,132
Will it help?

897
00:38:56,132 --> 00:38:57,925
Yeah.

898
00:38:57,925 --> 00:38:59,510
A statement from you
could mean the difference

899
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,263
between hard time
and treatment.

900
00:39:02,263 --> 00:39:03,723
That's very generous
of you.

901
00:39:03,723 --> 00:39:05,349
No.

00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:07,310
