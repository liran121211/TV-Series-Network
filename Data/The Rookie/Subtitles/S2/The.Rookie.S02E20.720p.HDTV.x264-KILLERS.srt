1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,982
- Previously on "The Rookie"...
- Nick Armstrong.

2
00:00:01,984 --> 00:00:03,318
You can't be faithful to a girl,

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,346
you can't be faithful
to an oath or a badge.

4
00:00:05,348 --> 00:00:06,377
I'll drink to that.

5
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:09,314
I interviewed for my
dream job. I got it.

6
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:11,783
- That's great!
- It's in New York.

7
00:00:11,785 --> 00:00:14,119
Rosalind Dyer,
the most rare of unicorns...

8
00:00:14,121 --> 00:00:15,454
a female serial killer.

9
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:17,289
I led the task force
that caught Rosalind.

10
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:18,624
Don't let me off that easy!

11
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:20,459
My wife was dying! I wasn't there!

12
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:22,461
I do know one last secret.

13
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:25,464
- I don't care.
- It's about Armstrong. And it is bad.

14
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:27,900
Name names, okay? Just testify.

15
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,768
Armstrong.

16
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,936
Armstrong.

17
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:33,505
She said his name before she saw him.

18
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:35,774
_

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,315
_

20
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,993
Hollywood division is in pursuit

21
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:52,398
after a shots fired call.

22
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,563
Uh, gr... gray Maserati, no plates.

23
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:56,032
Suspect vehicle is picking up speed.

24
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:57,200
He's... He's blowing lights.

25
00:00:57,202 --> 00:00:59,069
Sidewalk! Sidewalk!
He's on the sidewalk!

26
00:00:59,071 --> 00:01:00,738
- Wait. That voice.
- We are lead car.

27
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,362
- That's Chris.
- I'm gonna need backup, guys!

28
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:03,519
We went to the Academy together.

29
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,721
- Hey, get back! Get back!
- Hands! Hands on the window!

30
00:01:09,932 --> 00:01:11,031
Okay, keep breathing.

31
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:12,599
7-Adam-07, shots fired.

32
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:14,601
Officer down. Repeat, officer down.

33
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:22,776
Hey. Not a good time right now.

34
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:24,211
Serj just shot a cop.

35
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:26,285
That was him?

36
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,343
If he can escape...

37
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:29,049
Escape? Ruben, come on.

38
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:32,786
Even if he gets clear,
10,000 cops are hunting him.

39
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:35,322
Attention all units,
Air-12 spotted a gray Maserati

40
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:36,623
matching suspect's vehicle

41
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,492
entering covered parking
structure at 6th and Grand.

42
00:01:39,494 --> 00:01:41,661
They just spotted his
car, man. He's cooked.

43
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:43,230
Well, if he's cooked, then so are you.

44
00:01:43,232 --> 00:01:44,497
- You understand?
- Ruben!

45
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:46,800
Damn it!

46
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:48,635
There.

47
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,251
Got a gun.

48
00:01:52,253 --> 00:01:54,107
You need to secure it while
I go after the suspect.

49
00:01:54,109 --> 00:01:55,675
Control, 7-Adam-15.

50
00:01:55,677 --> 00:01:56,810
Suspect vehicle located

51
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:59,412
in a parking structure on 6th and Grand.

52
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:01,948
Gun on scene. Need backup. Code 3.

53
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,850
Control, 7-Adam-15.

54
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:05,652
Shut down all Code 3 units.

55
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:06,820
Suspect is G.O.A.

56
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:11,781
Hey. I don't know how,
but Serj got away.

57
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,093
'Cause I'm a slippery bitch.

58
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:15,095
Serj, don't be smug.

59
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:16,830
You left the damn gun in the car.

60
00:02:21,136 --> 00:02:22,301
It must've slipped out.

61
00:02:22,303 --> 00:02:23,837
Yeah, and when ballistics matches it

62
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,004
to the wounded officer,

63
00:02:25,006 --> 00:02:26,973
you're gonna spend the rest
of your life in Pelican Bay.

64
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:28,508
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Screw that.

65
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,843
Ruben said you were gonna fix it.

66
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:32,445
So fix it. We own you.

67
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:38,385
Okay, if I can make the gun go away,

68
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:40,387
it'll cripple any case against you.

69
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:42,245
- What do you think I should do?
- Go to ground.

70
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,870
And don't call me no more. You hear me?

71
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,640
Everything goes through Ruben.

72
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:48,995
No sign of the suspect?

73
00:02:48,997 --> 00:02:51,698
No, he got away clean. But
we did recover his weapon.

74
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,999
Nine-mil. Recently fired.

75
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:54,701
Good work. Anything else?

76
00:02:54,703 --> 00:02:58,071
Uh, yes. Car is registered
to a dealership...

77
00:02:58,073 --> 00:02:59,639
International Luxury Auto.

78
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:01,708
- Stolen?
- Not reported.

79
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:04,234
We need to run background checks
on the dealership employees.

80
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:06,501
Already happening, but we
would get a much faster ID

81
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,660
from the mobile fingerprint
unit inside your car.

82
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:11,119
We pulled a clean print from
the driver's side window.

83
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:13,052
Uh, yeah. Great.

84
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:29,669
And just like that,
our suspect has a name.

85
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:31,404
Serj Derian.

86
00:03:31,406 --> 00:03:33,072
Control, suspect is Serj Derian.

87
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:35,942
Run a full background check
and alert the Watch Commander.

88
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:38,946
_

89
00:03:40,148 --> 00:03:43,350
LAPD! Serj Derian,
come out with your hands up!

90
00:03:44,753 --> 00:03:47,187
- Clear!
- Clear!

91
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:49,222
- You got something?
- Police report.

92
00:03:49,224 --> 00:03:50,924
"Suspect... Serj Derian".

93
00:03:50,926 --> 00:03:52,459
His name is all over these.

94
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:53,626
Someone inside the department

95
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:55,585
has been feeding intel
to the Armenian mob.

96
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:56,976
And by someone, you mean...

97
00:03:56,978 --> 00:03:59,101
A dirty cop.

98
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:05,848
Still thinking about Grace?

99
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:08,441
You're a good detective.

100
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:10,532
You're an easy case.

101
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:12,624
You know what?

102
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:13,863
When we get back to the station,

103
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,571
I'm gonna book the evidence,
I'm gonna call her.

104
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:16,749
Call her?

105
00:04:16,751 --> 00:04:18,218
You better get your ass over there

106
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,553
and tell her in person.

107
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:26,659
They're putting together a
raid at Ruben Derian's house.

108
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:29,229
- Is Serj there?
- Only one way to find out.

109
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:33,266
Control, 7-Adam-15.
Attach us to that ATL.

110
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:43,881
_

111
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,819
- Any eye on Serj?
- Not yet,

112
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:54,687
but there's at least a
handful of unknowns inside.

113
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:57,257
I would put Stapleton, Cole,
and Brady on the 3/4 corner.

114
00:04:57,259 --> 00:04:59,125
Jennings and Sanchez,
they can take the 2 side,

115
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:01,494
and we'll join in on the stack.

116
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:03,997
Sorry. Second nature.

117
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,266
All good, sir. You're the
senior detective on site.

118
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:07,700
Operation is yours.

119
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:08,736
Okay.

120
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:11,522
You're acting detective?

121
00:05:11,524 --> 00:05:13,973
- For the day.
- Doing great.

122
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:16,576
Okay. Stack, fall in.

123
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:17,844
Suit up.

124
00:05:17,846 --> 00:05:20,179
Redcon 1, let's go. Let's move.

125
00:05:24,353 --> 00:05:25,418
Stand up!

126
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,120
Hands on your head! Turn around!

127
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:28,578
What can I do for you?

128
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,970
We have a warrant to search
the premises for Serj Derian.

129
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:32,294
You could have just called.

130
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,295
So much banging and
crashing just to discover

131
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:37,630
that my brother didn't randomly drop by.

132
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:39,332
All clear. No sign of Serj.

133
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:41,868
Mr. Derian, we'd like you to come
with us to the station voluntarily.

134
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,936
Yeah, you bet.

135
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:45,305
Uh, look, why don't I meet
you guys down there, huh?

136
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:46,973
There's only a half-hour left.

137
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:48,708
_

138
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:56,149
- Best game of the season. Good series.
- _

139
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:57,884
Tactical master class.

140
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,757
What the hell's going on?

141
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:06,859
Why was I called to your
station, Code 2 High?

142
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:09,896
Because they know a cop took Serj's gun

143
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:12,065
from Nolan's shop during the raid.

144
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,100
They're checking body cameras.

145
00:06:14,102 --> 00:06:16,392
I'm dead. Mine wasn't on.

146
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:18,551
T-They're gonna know the second
that they check that video.

147
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:20,239
- Hold it together, Erin.
- Screw that!

148
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:22,241
I'm the one exposed here.
You have to do something.

149
00:06:22,243 --> 00:06:24,844
I am! And if you do exactly what I say,

150
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:26,779
you've got a shot at getting away clean.

151
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,950
Ruben's got a half a million
for you, to help you disappear.

152
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:32,085
You're lying.

153
00:06:32,087 --> 00:06:33,786
No, I'm not.

154
00:06:33,788 --> 00:06:35,021
And with me on the inside

155
00:06:35,023 --> 00:06:37,256
making sure the case
against Serj falls apart,

156
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:38,925
you just might be able to survive this,

157
00:06:38,927 --> 00:06:43,229
but only if you play it cool, okay?

158
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:45,131
I'm scared.

159
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:47,700
I know.

160
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:50,403
Turn in your body camera
and then get out of here.

161
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:51,971
But first, leave your cellphone

162
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:53,796
and anything else they
can use to track you.

163
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:56,109
You got someplace to go where
you can get off the grid?

164
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:58,745
Yeah. I do.

165
00:06:58,747 --> 00:07:00,214
Okay. Good.

166
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:05,952
Don't screw me here, Detective.

167
00:07:05,954 --> 00:07:07,220
I won't.

168
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:38,751
You told her I'd give
her a half a million?

169
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:40,153
- Are you crazy?
- Hey, hey,

170
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:41,854
hey, don't cheap out on me now, Ruben.

171
00:07:41,856 --> 00:07:43,790
- Erin's lost everything.
- Not yet.

172
00:07:43,792 --> 00:07:45,291
Listen to me.

173
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:47,193
- You don't have to kill her.
- She's weak.

174
00:07:47,195 --> 00:07:48,778
She'll flip the second they catch her,

175
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,062
and she won't just give me up.

176
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:51,297
She'll give you up, too.

177
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:53,433
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do. And so do you.

178
00:07:53,435 --> 00:07:56,302
Which is why you're gonna
make sure she stays silent.

179
00:07:56,304 --> 00:07:57,638
Forever.

180
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:01,441
No. I won't.

181
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:03,843
I've done a lot of bad things for you,

182
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:04,911
but I ain't doing that.

183
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:06,679
Yes, you will, my friend.

184
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:08,481
Because when you sell me your soul,

185
00:08:08,483 --> 00:08:10,283
you don't get to choose how I use it.

186
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:11,851
Hey, you... Ruben!

187
00:08:11,853 --> 00:08:13,152
Hey! You...

188
00:08:13,154 --> 00:08:15,354
Alright.

189
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:17,724
7-William-10, are you clear for a 10-21?

190
00:08:17,726 --> 00:08:19,792
- Code 3.
- 7-William-10.

191
00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:20,993
Clear.

192
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:22,862
Hey, Nolan. What's up?

193
00:08:22,864 --> 00:08:24,897
We have a possible
location for Erin Cole.

194
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:26,165
You want in?

195
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:30,169
Uh, yeah.

196
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:31,370
Yeah, I want in.

197
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:33,307
_

198
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:41,147
- Clear!
- What do we got?

199
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:43,082
She's on foot. A few steps ahead.

200
00:08:43,084 --> 00:08:44,383
Alright, everybody head inside.

201
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:47,720
Split up. She could be anywhere.

202
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,902
You know me. Come on.

203
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:04,203
We've been through a lot together.

204
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:06,172
You can talk to me. Just talk to me.

205
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:08,508
I never wanted this.

206
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,244
I had problems. You know?

207
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:13,412
Debts.

208
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:16,249
They paid them, and then...
then they owned me.

209
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,050
Who did? The Derians?

210
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:19,185
Yeah.

211
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:20,887
And I told Serj I was done,

212
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,922
but he... he pulled a gun

213
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:25,525
and he tried to kill me
when I wouldn't scare and...

214
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:28,094
The shots fired call.

215
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:30,096
Chris is dead because of me.

216
00:09:30,098 --> 00:09:31,999
No, no, no! Wait! No, don't.

217
00:09:33,968 --> 00:09:36,936
It doesn't have to all be for nothing.

218
00:09:36,938 --> 00:09:39,972
Okay, you can start to make this right.

219
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:41,440
Just...

220
00:09:41,442 --> 00:09:43,409
name names.

221
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:45,245
Okay? Just testify.

222
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:47,880
Armstrong.

223
00:10:03,598 --> 00:10:05,298
25-year-old female,

224
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,800
multiple gunshot wounds to the chest.

225
00:10:07,802 --> 00:10:09,902
Not conscious, not breathing.

226
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:28,454
You did good, my friend.

227
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:29,488
Very good.

228
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,961
I'm out.

229
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:38,998
There is no out.

230
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,300
You know this.

231
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:46,038
Shut up! Shut up!

232
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,340
I said I'm out.

233
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:50,443
I've paid my debt off five times over.

234
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:53,045
I can't do this anymore.
You can't make me.

235
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:56,048
There... is... no... out.

236
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,117
I s-s...

237
00:11:01,456 --> 00:11:02,955
Your work isn't done.

238
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:05,358
The cops don't have
any evidence on Serj.

239
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,293
But you need to make
sure it stays that way.

240
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:10,997
And if anyone gets close to the truth...

241
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:12,531
you need to take care of them.

242
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:20,373
I promise it'll be
easier the second time.

243
00:11:26,981 --> 00:11:28,214
Armstrong.

244
00:11:28,216 --> 00:11:29,616
No!

245
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:33,686
- You think I'm crazy.
- _

246
00:11:33,688 --> 00:11:37,223
No. It's just been a traumatic 24 hours,

247
00:11:37,225 --> 00:11:38,691
and I think you're fried.

248
00:11:38,693 --> 00:11:39,792
It's clear...

249
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:42,561
she says "Armstrong"
before he steps out.

250
00:11:42,563 --> 00:11:45,264
She was trying to tell
me something about him.

251
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:47,533
Maybe, but it could have been anything.

252
00:11:47,535 --> 00:11:49,804
I mean, look, we know
that Erin was a dirty cop,

253
00:11:49,806 --> 00:11:51,237
but we have seen nothing to suggest

254
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:54,006
that she was working with
anyone else on the job.

255
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:55,408
How did she get into my shop, then?

256
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,509
I locked it.

257
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:58,277
And as a detective,

258
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,179
Armstrong would have a very easy time

259
00:12:00,181 --> 00:12:02,950
getting his hands on those files
without leaving a paper trail.

260
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:07,553
So, what, Armstrong murdered
Erin to shut her up?

261
00:12:07,555 --> 00:12:09,422
Do you realize what
you are accusing him of?

262
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:11,914
Yes, I do. He's my friend...

263
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:13,939
and a mentor, and this is killing me.

264
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,163
But if I'm right,

265
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:17,099
he's betraying everything we stand for.

266
00:12:21,956 --> 00:12:23,112
It's not enough.

267
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:24,803
So we gather more evidence.

268
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:27,440
Armstrong was with me
nearly all day yesterday.

269
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:29,375
It was a fast-moving situation,

270
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:32,578
but he had to have contacted
both Ruben and Erin,

271
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,236
contact that could have
been caught on body cam,

272
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:36,282
on shop cam or dash cam.

273
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:39,353
Which you need me
to authorize access to.

274
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:48,327
Alright.

275
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:50,596
I'm in.

276
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:53,332
But don't tell anyone else about this.

277
00:12:53,334 --> 00:12:55,668
If this gets out,
it will ruin Armstrong's life...

278
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,826
and your career.

279
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:58,450
And if I'm right?

280
00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,943
Then it will tear the department apart.

281
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,470

282
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:10,716
Thanks for being positive about my move.

283
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,275
Well, you haven't moved until
you get on that flight tonight.

284
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:19,278
And we still have one last dinner.

285
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,482
You'll come visit, right?

286
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:26,519
I mean, once Lucy's
Thirty Day Push is over?

287
00:13:34,996 --> 00:13:37,196
Hey. You're here early.

288
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:38,951
That would imply I left.

289
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:40,075
Any movement?

290
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:42,282
There's still no evidence
that puts Serj in that car.

291
00:13:42,284 --> 00:13:44,017
And they checked every traffic
camera on the chase route?

292
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:45,475
Yeah. All the way to the parking garage

293
00:13:45,477 --> 00:13:46,853
where the Maserati was abandoned.

294
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:48,221
And without the murder weapon,

295
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:50,023
I have to put Serj in that
car during the shooting

296
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,665
or he's gonna get away
with killing a cop.

297
00:13:55,197 --> 00:13:56,797
How you holding up?

298
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:00,166
I watched him die.

299
00:14:00,168 --> 00:14:02,335
It's, um...

300
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:04,137
It's tearing me up.

301
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,336
I've been where you are.

302
00:14:06,338 --> 00:14:08,471
I'm gonna help you get through it.

303
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,840
Thank you.

304
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,408
Alright.

305
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,843
We're gonna have to recanvass,

306
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:15,628
starting with the original 911 call.

307
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:18,026
L.A. is the most self-obsessed
city on the planet.

308
00:14:18,028 --> 00:14:20,650
Someone has a photo that
puts Serj behind the wheel.

309
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,784
Just watch.

310
00:14:21,786 --> 00:14:23,419
Every time there's a break in the case,

311
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:24,954
Armstrong sends a text.

312
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:28,602
_

313
00:14:31,584 --> 00:14:34,475
Okay, right here. Outside Ruben's house.

314
00:14:34,477 --> 00:14:36,651
When he crosses past Erin,

315
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:38,421
you can see him slip her something.

316
00:14:38,423 --> 00:14:40,279
That's a stretch. You
can't see their hands.

317
00:14:40,281 --> 00:14:42,752
True, but after this, inside the house,

318
00:14:42,754 --> 00:14:44,990
Armstrong is checking
his phone during the raid

319
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:47,769
to see when Erin has got
the gun from my shop,

320
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:48,836
and I swear to God,

321
00:14:48,838 --> 00:14:50,932
you can see the exact
moment he finds out she did.

322
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:52,654
Well, this is all still circumstantial.

323
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:54,722
I mean, Armstrong could
be texting his mother

324
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:56,057
or his girlfriend.

325
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:58,153
I'm not saying that I believe that,

326
00:14:58,155 --> 00:15:00,294
but this is still not
enough to take to IA.

327
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:02,096
What if we can tell what
he was texting and to who?

328
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:03,931
Could we get a warrant?
Search his phone records?

329
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,299
If Armstrong really is dirty,

330
00:15:05,301 --> 00:15:07,101
do you believe that he is dumb enough

331
00:15:07,103 --> 00:15:09,488
to crime on his own personal cellphone?

332
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:11,513
No.

333
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:13,240
I can't get a warrant for a burner

334
00:15:13,242 --> 00:15:14,398
unless we know the number.

335
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,943
So how do we get that number?

336
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:18,779
Isolate the signal somehow.

337
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:20,926
Get him out in the middle of nowhere,

338
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:23,284
where there's only a few active phones,

339
00:15:23,286 --> 00:15:26,954
and then we pull the records
from the nearest cell tower.

340
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:28,389
So how do we get him out there?

341
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:29,547
I have an idea.

342
00:15:29,549 --> 00:15:31,125
How did the shooting inquiry go?

343
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:32,193
Smooth so far.

344
00:15:32,195 --> 00:15:33,990
They said they might reach
out for some follow-up,

345
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:36,096
but given what's at stake,
they're keeping me active duty.

346
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:37,231
That's good news.

347
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,833
We need you out there
turning over rocks,

348
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:40,968
- avenging Officer Rios.
- Yeah.

349
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,803
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes?

350
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:44,389
I might have a way to run down Serj.

351
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:45,556
You got my attention.

352
00:15:45,558 --> 00:15:48,126
There's a former contact of
mine from way back in the day.

353
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:50,294
He runs in the same
circles as Serj and Ruben.

354
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:51,686
He might talk to me.

355
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:53,447
Well, run it down.
You don't need my permission.

356
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,906
I do if I want to go
plainclothes and unmarked.

357
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:57,772
I'll spook him if I show
up in blues and a shop.

358
00:15:57,774 --> 00:15:58,873
Do it.

359
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,136
Good having you back out there, Nick.

360
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,079
Hey!

361
00:16:07,081 --> 00:16:08,970
You, uh, mind if I tag along?

362
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:10,829
Better than finding my own clues.

363
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:12,965
Sure. The more, the merrier.

364
00:16:12,967 --> 00:16:14,322
Great. Uh, let me grab my keys.

365
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:16,024
I'll meet you in the parking lot.

366
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:18,082
What I'm about to tell
you stays between us.

367
00:16:18,084 --> 00:16:19,106
Okay.

368
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:20,695
For the last nine months,

369
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:22,196
Vice has had an active informant

370
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,066
inside Ruben Derian's operation.

371
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,334
Cisco Fane.

372
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:27,902
Third-generation bottom-feeder.

373
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,237
He's helped generate
three search warrants

374
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,205
netting over $2 million in narcotics.

375
00:16:31,207 --> 00:16:32,473
He could give us Serj.

376
00:16:32,475 --> 00:16:33,808
That's the hope.

377
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,043
But Cisco's been radio silent

378
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:37,011
since he was sent a request
for a meet yesterday.

379
00:16:37,013 --> 00:16:38,913
And you're worried
he's been compromised?

380
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,083
I'm worried he's been
dumped in a shallow grave.

381
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:45,005
You think Erin's the only
dirty cop on Derian's payroll?

382
00:16:45,007 --> 00:16:46,421
I think you always plan for the worst,

383
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,857
which is why we're
keeping this op quiet.

384
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:51,359
Any idea where Cisco
could be? If he's not dead.

385
00:16:51,361 --> 00:16:53,061
Well, the Derians have been muscling in

386
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:54,495
on the east side sex trade.

387
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:57,031
They've taken over
SROs, massage parlors,

388
00:16:57,033 --> 00:16:59,000
and a karaoke bar where Cisco works.

389
00:16:59,002 --> 00:17:00,524
I-I still can't believe karaoke bars

390
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:01,626
are covers for brothels.

391
00:17:01,628 --> 00:17:03,371
Everywhere is a cover for a brothel.

392
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:05,206
That's depressing.

393
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,031
I should ride with Armstrong.

394
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:09,110
We need eyes on him at all times.

395
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,379
Alright, but be very
careful what you say.

396
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:12,603
If you are right about him,

397
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:14,288
he's basically been operating undercover

398
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,812
inside the police department.

399
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:18,802
- His radar is gonna be hypersensitive.
- Got it.

400
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:20,455
- And make him drive.
- Okay.

401
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:21,522
Why?

402
00:17:21,524 --> 00:17:23,919
Behind the wheel, you're
at a tactical disadvantage.

403
00:17:23,921 --> 00:17:25,207
If anything goes south,

404
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:27,944
you'll need both hands
to defend yourself.

405
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:31,065
So, who's your contact?

406
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:35,103
Just some overachieving
dirtbag I used to hang with.

407
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:36,204
He got a name?

408
00:17:36,206 --> 00:17:37,872
Yep.

409
00:17:37,874 --> 00:17:40,475
Ah, okay. Okay.

410
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:43,111
I'm piggybacking on your play. I get it.

411
00:17:43,113 --> 00:17:45,279
You at least gonna tell me where
we're meeting Mr. Nameless?

412
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:47,382
Uh, Baldwin Hills.

413
00:17:47,384 --> 00:17:48,449
Cool if I ride with you?

414
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:49,550
Sure thing.

415
00:17:49,552 --> 00:17:50,985
You mind driving, though?

416
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:52,421
I didn't get much sleep last night.

417
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:56,090
- Sure.
- Great.

418
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,535
This is where the
high-speed chase began.

419
00:18:02,537 --> 00:18:05,730
9:15 yesterday morning, a local
calls in shots fired to 911.

420
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:06,934
Based on Erin's confession,

421
00:18:06,936 --> 00:18:09,277
we know that she was meeting
Serj here to pass along intel.

422
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,512
Things got heated, and they
started firing at each other.

423
00:18:11,514 --> 00:18:13,714
Chris and his T.O. arrive on
the scene two minutes later,

424
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,850
in time to see the Maserati
haul ass out of here.

425
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:19,554
Eight minutes later,
Chris is fatally wounded.

426
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,589
You sure you're up for this?

427
00:18:21,591 --> 00:18:23,981
- You could still take the day, if you need it.
- No way.

428
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:26,514
I want to see this guy in
handcuffs just as badly as you.

429
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:27,871
On the bright side, it sure does

430
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:29,496
put my wedding drama in perspective.

431
00:18:29,498 --> 00:18:30,687
Does that mean you're letting

432
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:31,978
the two moms plan the festivities?

433
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,349
Hell no. But I will work a little harder

434
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:35,473
to listen to their advice.

435
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:36,731
Uh, excuse me, sir?

436
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:38,189
Were you here yesterday morning?

437
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:39,313
No, they chased me out.

438
00:18:39,315 --> 00:18:41,100
- Who chased you out?
- The bride and groom.

439
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:42,777
- What were they doing?
- Who?

440
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,470
- The bride and groom.
- Posing.

441
00:18:44,472 --> 00:18:46,272
For what? Photos?

442
00:18:46,274 --> 00:18:49,064
Wait, why would someone
take wedding pictures here?

443
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:51,510
Who cares why? Were they
taking pictures of themselves?

444
00:18:51,512 --> 00:18:53,279
No, they had an angry camera lady.

445
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:54,881
She's the one that chased me away.

446
00:18:58,853 --> 00:19:00,753
- That's something.
- Yeah.

447
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:11,797
Do you know who Harper's contact is?

448
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,265
To be honest, no.

449
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:15,668
She's always been very
protective of her sources.

450
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,936
Smart.

451
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:19,638
Gotta keep sensitive
information need-to-know.

452
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,373
Officer Cole proved that.

453
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,375
How you coping after the shooting?

454
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:25,511
Yeah, it's been rough.

455
00:19:25,513 --> 00:19:27,379
I keep replaying it over
and over in my head,

456
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:29,515
wondering what I could
have done different.

457
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:32,351
She pointed her gun at you.
You had to take the shot.

458
00:19:32,353 --> 00:19:35,621
Yeah, but you said you thought
you were getting through to her.

459
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:37,223
If I just hadn't
surprised her like that,

460
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:39,291
who knows what would have happened?

461
00:19:39,293 --> 00:19:40,893
She might have flipped.

462
00:19:40,895 --> 00:19:44,230
Given us Serj and Ruben.

463
00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:46,367
And anyone else in the
department who might be dirty.

464
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:48,734
You think there's another
rat in the department?

465
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:50,503
God, I hope not.

466
00:19:57,339 --> 00:19:59,061
It's Rachel's last night.

467
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:00,519
You doing anything special?

468
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:03,549
Dinner, take her to the airport.

469
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:04,984
Wow.

470
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,133
You always said it would
be a cold day in Hell

471
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:08,822
before you drove anyone to LAX.

472
00:20:09,724 --> 00:20:13,859
So... are you really gonna
visit Rachel in New York?

473
00:20:13,861 --> 00:20:15,895
No.

474
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:18,697
I'm gonna rip the Band-Aid
off at dinner tonight.

475
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:20,566
Long distance never works.

476
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:21,600
You don't know that.

477
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:23,869
Yeah. I do.

478
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:25,704
I'm really gonna miss her.

479
00:20:25,706 --> 00:20:27,540
Me too.

480
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:29,742
So, what's the plan?

481
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:31,744
We're gonna go practice our ABCs.

482
00:20:31,746 --> 00:20:33,879
What if we find Cisco?

483
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:35,681
- Improvise.
- Thank you.

484
00:20:35,683 --> 00:20:37,516
Why does God hate me?

485
00:20:37,518 --> 00:20:38,617
Good morning.

486
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:39,872
We're here conducting

487
00:20:39,874 --> 00:20:41,954
an Alcohol Beverage
Control compliance check.

488
00:20:41,956 --> 00:20:44,290
Kiss my ass. We don't serve minors here.

489
00:20:44,292 --> 00:20:46,454
I follow the laws, even the dumb ones.

490
00:20:46,456 --> 00:20:47,511
Convincing argument,

491
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:49,428
yet we're gonna need to
put eyes on everyone here.

492
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,719
It's the Police Department.

493
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:52,932
I need everyone to step
out into the hall now.

494
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,934
- Come on.
- Let's go. Come out.

495
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:56,869
IDs out.

496
00:20:57,905 --> 00:20:59,905
Step outside.

497
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:01,575
- Let's go.
- Tim.

498
00:21:03,945 --> 00:21:05,978
Don't you shoot up my club.

499
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,980
I just had it painted.

500
00:21:07,982 --> 00:21:09,749
Get everyone back.

501
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,336
This is the police.

502
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,720
Need you to step out into the hall now.

503
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,989
Aw. Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

504
00:21:16,991 --> 00:21:18,390
What's going on?

505
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:19,658
What the hell'd you say to me?

506
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,926
- What?
- Get up against the wall.

507
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:22,795
Put your hand up.

508
00:21:22,797 --> 00:21:23,963
What?

509
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:26,432
LAPD's been looking for you.

510
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:28,801
Look, after the shooting,
Ruben locked everything down,

511
00:21:28,803 --> 00:21:30,502
made everyone give up their phones.

512
00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:31,770
Here's a new one.

513
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:34,406
I need you to find out
where Serj is and text me.

514
00:21:34,408 --> 00:21:36,475
They'll cut me into
pieces if they catch me.

515
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:38,344
Tough, alright?

516
00:21:38,346 --> 00:21:41,480
You do it, or I violate
you and send you to Lompoc.

517
00:21:41,482 --> 00:21:43,416
- You got that?
- Yeah.

518
00:21:44,352 --> 00:21:46,352
He's clean.

519
00:21:46,354 --> 00:21:47,854
Watch your attitude next time.

520
00:21:48,956 --> 00:21:50,623
I told you, we don't serve minors.

521
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,790
Yeah, you did.

522
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:53,592
But I noticed a half-dozen
other infractions.

523
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:55,595
I'd get those fixed
before Code Enforcement

524
00:21:55,597 --> 00:21:56,663
shows up in the morning.

525
00:21:57,665 --> 00:21:59,365
Have a nice day.

526
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:01,600
I checked every event space
within a mile of the warehouse.

527
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:03,202
None of them had weddings yesterday.

528
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:04,670
Where'd this bride and groom come from?

529
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:06,538
No idea. And without
a venue to question,

530
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,766
we're left calling up every
photographer in Los Angeles.

531
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:11,010
Well, social media to the rescue.

532
00:22:11,012 --> 00:22:13,479
#Wedding.

533
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:14,980
That's a lot.

534
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:17,116
Try #WreckTheDress.

535
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:19,111
- Okay.
- It's the new thing.

536
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:20,719
Destroy your dress after the wedding.

537
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:22,488
Wait, don't dresses cost a fortune?

538
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,856
Why in the hell would people do that?

539
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:25,592
To spite their mother-in-laws.

540
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:29,628
- Wait.
- Whoa.

541
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,030
That's the Maserati.

542
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:32,865
We gotta get that photographer in here.

543
00:22:41,742 --> 00:22:43,742
Stay here. I won't be long.

544
00:22:43,744 --> 00:22:45,676
Excuse me. With all due respect,

545
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:46,891
we should be in there with you,

546
00:22:46,893 --> 00:22:48,360
in case things go sideways.

547
00:22:48,362 --> 00:22:49,915
Negative. My guy is skittish.

548
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:51,484
If I need you, I will signal.

549
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:57,189
She go rogue like this all the time?

550
00:22:57,191 --> 00:22:58,691
Not all the time.

551
00:22:58,693 --> 00:23:00,759
Why are you so worried?

552
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:02,594
I'm not.

553
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:04,063
I just want to do this by the book.

554
00:23:04,065 --> 00:23:06,532
The last thing we need
is another officer down.

555
00:23:07,735 --> 00:23:09,068
Ah. That's Henry.

556
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,436
Do you mind if I take this?

557
00:23:10,438 --> 00:23:11,937
Yeah, yeah.

558
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:13,572
Hey.

559
00:23:13,574 --> 00:23:14,673
How's he doing?

560
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:16,075
Uh, definitely anxious.

561
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:17,943
- He text anyone?
- No, not yet.

562
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:20,157
Alright. I'll stay inside
another 10 minutes,

563
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,680
make him sweat.

564
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:23,683
_

565
00:23:27,404 --> 00:23:28,560
Hey, Grace.

566
00:23:28,562 --> 00:23:30,422
Hey. You answered.

567
00:23:30,424 --> 00:23:32,591
Yeah. Sorry. A lot's been going on.

568
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:34,460
I know. I...

569
00:23:34,462 --> 00:23:35,761
I wasn't thinking.

570
00:23:35,763 --> 00:23:38,430
I just, um...

571
00:23:38,432 --> 00:23:39,732
We need to talk.

572
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:40,933
I gotta go.

573
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:48,974
Wha... You... You were
supposed to stay outside.

574
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:50,109
Where's your guy?

575
00:23:50,111 --> 00:23:51,478
He went out back.

576
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:54,780
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Thought I heard something.

577
00:23:54,782 --> 00:23:56,081
Did your guy give up Serj?

578
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:58,784
No. Man, he was... he
was just playing me.

579
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:00,786
He... He just wanted reward money.

580
00:24:00,788 --> 00:24:03,222
That's aggravating.

581
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:05,924
But that's the job, right?

582
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:09,094
90% failure, 5% victory.

583
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:10,662
What's the other 5%?

584
00:24:10,664 --> 00:24:12,097
Fear.

585
00:24:12,099 --> 00:24:14,767
You mind driving back
with Detective Harper?

586
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:16,568
I've intruded on your time long enough.

587
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,970
- You got it.
- Alright.

588
00:24:17,972 --> 00:24:20,073
See you later.

589
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:25,844
You think he knows?

590
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:27,112
I think we better pray

591
00:24:27,114 --> 00:24:29,549
bringing him out here
was worth the risk.

592
00:24:35,156 --> 00:24:37,956
Alright, I got the cell records
from the nearest tower.

593
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:39,658
Four cellphones were pinged

594
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,178
during the 15 minutes we've been here.

595
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,196
Mine, yours,
Armstrong's official cell...

596
00:24:44,198 --> 00:24:46,999
hmm... and this.

597
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:49,034
His burner. We got it.

598
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:52,004
Can you pull up his
call and text records?

599
00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:54,006
- Damn it.
- What?

600
00:24:54,008 --> 00:24:56,141
That number was first
activated this morning.

601
00:24:56,143 --> 00:24:58,010
He hasn't made a single call or text.

602
00:24:58,012 --> 00:24:59,711
He's using a fresh burner phone today?

603
00:24:59,713 --> 00:25:00,813
That is smart.

604
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:02,681
Cops make the best criminals.

605
00:25:02,683 --> 00:25:03,982
We got to be smarter.

606
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:05,117
We got to trip him up somehow.

607
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,786
We got to get into his head.

608
00:25:09,918 --> 00:25:10,956
What?

609
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,634
Told you you'd be back.

610
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:25,902
You told me not to trust Armstrong.

611
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,411
Oh, John.

612
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:31,913
I get so few visitors.

613
00:25:31,915 --> 00:25:33,715
Let's catch up first.

614
00:25:33,717 --> 00:25:35,085
There's no time.

615
00:25:35,087 --> 00:25:36,420
Maybe for you.

616
00:25:36,422 --> 00:25:38,188
I've got nothing but time.

617
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:40,123
So, are you seeing anyone?

618
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,225
We're not talking about that.

619
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:42,726
Protective.

620
00:25:42,728 --> 00:25:44,662
Which means that you are.

621
00:25:44,664 --> 00:25:47,164
Okay, fine. Yes, I'm seeing someone.

622
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:50,167
She's an amateur astronomer
and professional luge polisher.

623
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,268
We met at a Lizzo concert.

624
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,570
We're gonna raise ocelots
together. It's very exciting.

625
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:55,539
Now, let's get back to Armstrong.

626
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:57,675
- You're no fun at all.
- Two cops are dead,

627
00:25:57,677 --> 00:25:59,843
and the guy I thought was
my friend is responsible.

628
00:25:59,845 --> 00:26:01,101
Now help me...

629
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:02,225
Kill him?

630
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,383
Catch him.

631
00:26:03,385 --> 00:26:06,417
Mm. Less interesting.

632
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,419
And help will cost you.

633
00:26:08,421 --> 00:26:10,287
Cost me what?

634
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:12,856
The truth. About that girlfriend.

635
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:14,693
- Forget it.
- Okay.

636
00:26:20,566 --> 00:26:23,867
She's thinking about
going back to her husband.

637
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:26,204
She's been trying to call me all day.

638
00:26:28,574 --> 00:26:30,441
Well, call her back.

639
00:26:30,443 --> 00:26:31,643
Right now.

640
00:26:41,654 --> 00:26:43,754
Hey.

641
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:47,291
You've been trying to call me

642
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:49,360
to tell me you're getting
back together with Simon.

643
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,929
I'm sorry.

644
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:53,664
Do you love him?

645
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:55,466
No.

646
00:26:55,468 --> 00:26:57,468
But I have to do this for Oliver.

647
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,245
I know you think you do,

648
00:26:59,247 --> 00:27:00,938
- but you're wrong.
- John...

649
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,507
I've been going back and
forth in my head for days.

650
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:06,410
Do I give you your space
or do I tell you how I feel?

651
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:08,315
I know how much you love your son.

652
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:11,041
I know you'd do anything
to make him happy.

653
00:27:11,043 --> 00:27:12,510
But I've been down this road.

654
00:27:14,081 --> 00:27:17,105
I've stayed together for
the kid, and it's a mistake.

655
00:27:17,107 --> 00:27:18,696
Please don't.

656
00:27:18,698 --> 00:27:21,400
I mean, this is so hard for me to do.

657
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:24,035
Grace, I love you.

658
00:27:26,389 --> 00:27:29,257
That has to matter.

659
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:32,936
I have to go.

660
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:35,272
- Grace...
- I'm sorry.

661
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:42,513
How are you feeling?

662
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:44,783
Don't push it, Rosalind.

663
00:27:47,686 --> 00:27:49,686
Now tell me what you
know about Armstrong.

664
00:27:51,457 --> 00:27:53,390
Before my arrest, he broke into my house

665
00:27:53,392 --> 00:27:54,525
without a warrant.

666
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:55,959
Yeah, he told me about that.

667
00:27:55,961 --> 00:27:58,862
Well, I broke into his.

668
00:27:58,864 --> 00:28:00,831
Afterwards.

669
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,966
And you found something.

670
00:28:02,968 --> 00:28:06,236
A hidden compartment in
the laundry room wall...

671
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:08,972
filled with all kinds of goodies.

672
00:28:08,974 --> 00:28:10,374
Like what?

673
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:13,977
Money. Guns. Evidence.

674
00:28:13,979 --> 00:28:17,014
The sort of thing a crooked
cop keeps for insurance.

675
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:20,079
Sadly, nothing I could use
to keep me out of prison.

676
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:22,415
Unfortunately for you...

677
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:24,707
they're not gonna take
the word of a serial killer

678
00:28:24,709 --> 00:28:26,552
- to give you a search warrant.
- No, they're not.

679
00:28:26,554 --> 00:28:29,156
I'm gonna have to do
what you did... break in.

680
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:31,791
Hope that I can find something

681
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,593
that will lead me to
evidence I can actually use.

682
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:36,128
I don't think your T.O.
is gonna approve of that.

683
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,397
You'd be surprised.

684
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,399
But this is a one-man operation.

685
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:41,401
I owe Harper too much to
put her career in jeopardy.

686
00:28:41,403 --> 00:28:43,403
So noble.

687
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:45,838
I give you 6-to-1 odds against, though.

688
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,240
Odds of what?

689
00:28:47,242 --> 00:28:49,409
Surviving.

690
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:51,844
Armstrong is much
smarter than you, John.

691
00:28:51,846 --> 00:28:54,615
Twice as ruthless. Hell, he caught me.

692
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,218
So, if this is the last time I see you,

693
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,421
you will live on in my fantasies.

694
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:03,423
Well, that makes one of us.

695
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,658
I told you I'd keep you posted.

696
00:31:19,727 --> 00:31:22,663
I'm taking care of it.
You don't have to know how.

697
00:31:29,537 --> 00:31:30,971
I gotta go.

698
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:06,572
- Hey.
- Are you still at the prison?

699
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:07,673
I'm on my way back.

700
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,108
Rosalind give you anything useful?

701
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,209
Nah. It was a dead end.

702
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:12,868
Uh, I think it's time to
bring Grey into the loop.

703
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:13,879
How far away are you?

704
00:32:13,881 --> 00:32:18,918
20 minutes.

705
00:32:27,476 --> 00:32:29,184
Rachel.

706
00:32:29,186 --> 00:32:31,453
Hi. I'm at the front desk.

707
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:33,522
- Where are you?
- Oh.

708
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:36,858
I am... I'm sorry.
The day just got away from me.

709
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,427
I can be back in 20 minutes.

710
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:40,529
Uh, Tim. It's Cisco.

711
00:32:40,531 --> 00:32:41,964
He got a location on Serj.

712
00:32:41,966 --> 00:32:43,432
- Rach...
- I heard.

713
00:32:43,434 --> 00:32:44,933
Go get him.

714
00:32:44,935 --> 00:32:46,201
I am so sorry.

715
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:50,172
It's okay. I-I understand.

716
00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:52,941
Guess I'll, uh, call you when I land.

717
00:32:52,943 --> 00:32:54,176
- In New York.
- Yeah.

718
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:55,711
Uh, please do that, okay?

719
00:32:55,713 --> 00:32:57,346
And again, I'm... I'm sorry.

720
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:02,885
Better this way.

721
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:14,526
Wait, go back.

722
00:33:20,504 --> 00:33:22,272
We got him. Thank you.

723
00:33:25,543 --> 00:33:27,076
Sir, we found photos that put Serj

724
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:28,477
in the Maserati during the pursuit.

725
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:29,680
Great job. Gear up.

726
00:33:29,682 --> 00:33:32,373
We just got a location.
SWAT's mobilizing.

727
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:34,521
Harper, grab Nolan, get
ready for a tactical assault.

728
00:33:34,523 --> 00:33:37,160
- Wheels up in two minutes.
- Sir, Nolan is currently unavailable,

729
00:33:37,162 --> 00:33:38,887
- but if I could talk to you in private for a second...
- No time.

730
00:33:38,889 --> 00:33:40,222
We got a cop killer to catch.

731
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:48,063
All available units respond
to the command post

732
00:33:48,065 --> 00:33:49,364
at Wilshire and Devonshire.

733
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:52,239
Special operations has
located suspect Serj Derian

734
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:53,702
and is requesting marked units

735
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:55,345
for additional perimeter
and traffic control.

736
00:33:55,347 --> 00:33:57,906
Attach over the box and
respond to the command post.

737
00:33:57,908 --> 00:33:59,608
_

738
00:34:02,012 --> 00:34:03,345
What?

739
00:34:03,347 --> 00:34:04,627
They know where you are.

740
00:34:04,629 --> 00:34:06,497
You gotta get out of there. Now.

741
00:34:07,718 --> 00:34:10,252
You screwed me. You're a dead man.

742
00:34:12,556 --> 00:34:14,189
Go!

743
00:34:20,384 --> 00:34:23,532
Stop! Get your hands
in the air! Drop the gun!

744
00:34:25,035 --> 00:34:27,269
Turn around! Get down on your knees!

745
00:34:27,271 --> 00:34:29,138
One down! Two steps back!

746
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,205
On your knees!

747
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:31,573
Don't move.

748
00:34:34,211 --> 00:34:36,145
- Police! Don't move!
- Drop the gun!

749
00:34:40,951 --> 00:34:43,285
You're under arrest for
the murder of Chris Rios.

750
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:48,757
Okay. Which terminal?

751
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:50,292
Uh, four.

752
00:34:50,294 --> 00:34:52,227
Thanks.

753
00:34:53,564 --> 00:34:55,198
Now what?

754
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,768
Passenger, please exit the vehicle.

755
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:10,612
I... I'm sorry I missed dinner.

756
00:35:10,614 --> 00:35:12,614
It's okay.

757
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:15,017
I probably would have
spent the entire time

758
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:16,351
thinking about the end.

759
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:21,423
Is this the end?

760
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:22,524
Yeah.

761
00:35:25,196 --> 00:35:26,695
I d... I don't know.

762
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:31,166
I... I spent the day
planning to say goodbye...

763
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:33,302
Yet, here you are.

764
00:35:33,304 --> 00:35:36,338
And yet, here I am.

765
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,542
Look, Rach, I don't know
what happens next...

766
00:35:40,544 --> 00:35:42,544
but I think we should find out.

767
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,360
_

768
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:02,998
Nick?

769
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,132
It's over, John.

770
00:36:04,134 --> 00:36:05,834
- What is?
- All of it.

771
00:36:05,836 --> 00:36:07,369
They caught Serj,

772
00:36:07,371 --> 00:36:09,371
and I'm dead if I don't make a deal.

773
00:36:09,373 --> 00:36:11,540
- Why did you do it?
- Not like this.

774
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:14,810
I owe you the truth, but face to face.

775
00:36:14,812 --> 00:36:17,045
I'll be sitting in my living room.

776
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:19,348
The back door's still open
from when you broke in.

777
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:23,618
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

778
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,534
Right here, John.

779
00:36:33,874 --> 00:36:35,407
Don't do anything stupid.

780
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:37,276
Little late for that. Where's Harper?

781
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,711
She's not along for this ride.

782
00:36:38,713 --> 00:36:40,212
Get on your knees,
hands behind your head.

783
00:36:40,214 --> 00:36:41,714
Sure, sure.

784
00:36:41,716 --> 00:36:43,582
I got some things I want
to get off my chest.

785
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:44,717
Save it for IA.

786
00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:46,585
Well, it's not for IA. It's for you.

787
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:48,454
Look, I can't make
this right. I know that.

788
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,656
But I have to at least try
to make you understand.

789
00:36:50,658 --> 00:36:52,225
You don't think I understand?

790
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,068
You sold us out,
and you murdered Erin Cole.

791
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,704
She pointed a gun at me.

792
00:36:57,746 --> 00:37:00,566
Look, I-I-I didn't want that to happen.

793
00:37:00,568 --> 00:37:03,016
I got caught up in a rip
current five years ago

794
00:37:03,018 --> 00:37:04,918
that I can't get out of.

795
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,985
When Rebecca died,

796
00:37:05,987 --> 00:37:08,488
I was a quarter million
dollars in the hole.

797
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,089
Insurance covered a fraction

798
00:37:10,091 --> 00:37:11,991
of what it cost to take care of her.

799
00:37:11,993 --> 00:37:14,360
I had debt collectors calling me up

800
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:16,396
when I was out in the
street chasing criminals,

801
00:37:16,398 --> 00:37:19,065
holding grieving victims in my arms.

802
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,631
And that makes everything you did okay?

803
00:37:20,633 --> 00:37:22,569
- Of course not, but...
- No.

804
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:26,072
You once told me not
to let you off the hook.

805
00:37:26,074 --> 00:37:29,509
"Confessed" to me that
Rosalind Dyer's case

806
00:37:29,511 --> 00:37:32,078
stopped you from being there
for your wife when she was dying.

807
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,547
Now I know that was a lie,
a lie you told yourself

808
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:36,416
because the truth was too painful.

809
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:39,085
- What's the truth?
- You're a coward.

810
00:37:39,087 --> 00:37:40,954
You weren't there for Rebecca

811
00:37:40,956 --> 00:37:43,623
because you were too
weak to watch her suffer,

812
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:46,593
so you blamed the job, same
way you blame your debts

813
00:37:46,595 --> 00:37:49,229
for becoming a criminal and a murderer.

814
00:37:49,231 --> 00:37:51,845
It doesn't matter that you fell down.

815
00:37:51,847 --> 00:37:54,204
Everybody falls down.

816
00:37:54,206 --> 00:37:57,297
What matters is what comes next.

817
00:37:57,299 --> 00:37:59,589
Do you make it right, or
do you just make it worse?

818
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:03,302
You know your problem, John?

819
00:38:09,477 --> 00:38:11,644
You think you're better than people.

820
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:13,212
No. Just you.

821
00:38:13,214 --> 00:38:14,928
Now get on the floor, arms out.

822
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,363
Here's the thing.

823
00:38:18,353 --> 00:38:20,353
I-I knew you were
onto me this morning...

824
00:38:20,355 --> 00:38:22,188
that whole wild goose chase.

825
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,956
So...

826
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,159
I spent the day preparing for the worst.

827
00:38:26,161 --> 00:38:27,627
Last time I ask.

828
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:29,028
Get on the damn ground.

829
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,396
You were friends with Erin.

830
00:38:30,398 --> 00:38:32,499
Hell, I found video of the two of you

831
00:38:32,501 --> 00:38:34,901
conspiring outside a
bar the other night.

832
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:38,037
Turns out, Serj recruited
you the same time as Erin,

833
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:42,508
paid you serious money to
funnel police files to him.

834
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:45,211
- No one's gonna believe that.
- Yeah, they will.

835
00:38:45,213 --> 00:38:46,980
'Cause I won't be the
only one saying it.

836
00:38:47,882 --> 00:38:50,317
There's another cop on the payroll.

837
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,186
John Nolan.

838
00:38:56,658 --> 00:38:58,424
Which bring us to this moment.

839
00:38:58,426 --> 00:39:01,060
You broke into my house to kill me

840
00:39:01,062 --> 00:39:03,229
because I found out you were dirty.

841
00:39:03,231 --> 00:39:06,065
But I killed you in self-defense.

842
00:39:08,236 --> 00:39:09,702
Aah!

843
00:39:09,704 --> 00:39:11,704
Oh!

844
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:16,042
Aah!

845
00:39:16,044 --> 00:39:18,177
Ohh!

846
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:20,346
Ahh.

847
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,551
Ahh.

848
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:27,954
Ohh!

849
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:29,689
I wouldn't do that.

850
00:39:29,691 --> 00:39:31,257
Control, this is Officer Nolan.

851
00:39:31,259 --> 00:39:33,025
You don't have time for that, John.

852
00:39:33,027 --> 00:39:35,595
You got to go, or they're gonna find it.

853
00:39:35,597 --> 00:39:37,096
Find what?

854
00:39:37,098 --> 00:39:40,266
The evidence in your house.

855
00:39:46,274 --> 00:39:48,274
Hurry, John!
