1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,196
Previously, on 'The Rookie'.

2
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:02,961
- No sign of infection.
- Infection?

3
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:05,188
You're murder-victim is part
of a homegrown terrorist cell.

4
00:00:05,257 --> 00:00:06,596
What type of Virus are we talking about?

5
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:09,095
A weaponized strain
of hemorrhagic fever.

6
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:10,697
- It's gonna be okay.
- I'm not going out

7
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:12,369
the way my man Pete here just did.

8
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:13,837
- I'm coming out.
- Show me those hands!

9
00:00:13,874 --> 00:00:15,908
Don't shoot.

10
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:17,187
- What the hell?
- He was reaching.

11
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:18,624
I don't think he was
reaching for a weapon.

12
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,729
So either she doesn't trust me
or she's a liar.

13
00:00:22,362 --> 00:00:23,969
He's back.

14
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:25,617
Tim!

15
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:33,109
7-Adam-15 escorting
CDC ambulance to Shaw Memorial.

16
00:00:33,183 --> 00:00:35,250
Heading east on South Grand.
I need a clear path.

17
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:36,754
<i>Copy that, 7-Adam-15.</i>

18
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,625
<i>CHP is en route to assist.</i>

19
00:00:38,968 --> 00:00:41,002
- Tim better make it.
- He will.

20
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:43,805
Is it the virus?

21
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:44,964
There's no bleeding, looks like

22
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,474
he's having a severe reaction

23
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:47,643
to the shot we gave him.

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,112
He's going into anaphylactic shock.

25
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,449
Get me epinephrine!

26
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:56,714
So, the CDC finally gave the all-clear

27
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:58,285
to search Jimmy Roskin's body.

28
00:00:58,322 --> 00:00:59,521
We found a burner phone.

29
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:01,253
I'm not gonna like where
this is going, am I?

30
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,848
He made a call before
I shot him, to another burner.

31
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:05,853
You think there's a third
terrorist out there?

32
00:01:06,028 --> 00:01:07,703
And we just killed his friends.

33
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:22,877
Hey! Can we get some help
over here, please?

34
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:24,737
Right now!

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,324
Gun!

36
00:01:35,952 --> 00:01:39,088
7-Adam-15! Shots fired! Shaw Memorial!

37
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:43,574
Flanking right!

38
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:47,153
- Covering!
- Moving!

39
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,367
Covering!

40
00:02:00,476 --> 00:02:02,276
Right behind you, right behind you.
Right behind you.

41
00:02:44,442 --> 00:02:46,230
Suspect in custody!

42
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,549
Doctor!

43
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:50,368
I need some help over here!

44
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:52,066
I got it!

45
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,716
Are you okay?

46
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:02,241
I should've... reloaded on the move.

47
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:04,137
You?

48
00:03:04,174 --> 00:03:06,476
I should've taken yesterday off.

49
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,278
When you said date night,

50
00:03:21,315 --> 00:03:24,223
I thought you meant wine and romance.

51
00:03:24,267 --> 00:03:27,703
Oh, there's wine,
and <i>there's</i> the romance.

52
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:31,645
I have processed crime scenes
that felt more romantic.

53
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:33,107
What? Come on. That's...

54
00:03:33,142 --> 00:03:34,422
- Well, that's accurate.
- Okay, look,

55
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,232
I... your new place,
it's gonna be great when you're done,

56
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:39,020
and, uh, you definitely...

57
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:41,236
- you seem happy working on it.
- Right?

58
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:43,746
I haven't felt
this much like me since...

59
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:46,120
well, since I loaded up a U-Haul,

60
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:47,822
drove across the country,
and became a cop.

61
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:50,158
And, uh, tomorrow,

62
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:52,260
you are back at work being a cop.

63
00:03:52,294 --> 00:03:53,995
Administrative leave is over.

64
00:03:54,029 --> 00:03:55,189
Yeah, <i>you</i> didn't take one, though.

65
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:57,559
No. No, no, no. No, DHS is different.

66
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,902
With a clean shoot,
it's just right back at work.

67
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:04,263
Are you sure you're ready
to hit the streets?

68
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,387
Yes! Yes. I just...

69
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:08,181
well, it's not gonna be
quite the same without Talia.

70
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:10,291
Taking that job over at ATF was smart.

71
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:11,976
You know, she was never gonna have

72
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:13,773
the career that she wanted
over at the LAPD, I mean...

73
00:04:13,809 --> 00:04:15,838
- not after she lied about her brother.
- Yeah.

74
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:18,465
At least she waited until
after I took the exam.

75
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:20,913
And if I passed,
six more months of training,

76
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,569
I'm no longer the oldest rookie.

77
00:04:22,604 --> 00:04:25,153
Well, you will always be
the oldest rookie to me.

78
00:04:25,239 --> 00:04:26,940
- Oh.
- Mm.

79
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,310
- Wait, what?
- Okay, yeah. I'm gonna go.

80
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:33,714
- Jess?
- Yeah?

81
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:37,000
Did it bother you at all?

82
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:39,630
Shooting Roskin like that?

83
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:41,493
Sure.

84
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:45,426
H-Have you been wondering this
for the last two weeks?

85
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,794
Well, you just never said anything,

86
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,030
and then I didn't...
<i>see</i> anything, so I...

87
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:54,367
Right. Um...

88
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:56,249
The truth is...

89
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:58,654
things like that
affect you a lot less...

90
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:01,620
the longer that you're on the job.

91
00:05:02,796 --> 00:05:04,481
It's just human nature.

92
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:18,186
Mnh.

93
00:05:18,882 --> 00:05:20,007
Mm.

94
00:05:20,155 --> 00:05:21,296
Morning.

95
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:22,515
Oh, hey.

96
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:24,698
Sorry, um... I can't find my shirt.

97
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,900
You want me to help?

98
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:29,002
Nope. I have a system.

99
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,304
Uh-huh.

100
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:31,905
Don't say anything.

101
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,114
I wasn't going to.

102
00:05:36,077 --> 00:05:37,678
- Ooh! Found it!
- Mm.

103
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:38,936
Ha-ha!

104
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,820
Huh.

105
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:44,718
What?

106
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,773
Nothing. Just...

107
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:51,024
it's a little messier...
since I moved in.

108
00:05:51,437 --> 00:05:53,927
Uh, we were dating before,
so I spent two hours cleaning up

109
00:05:53,962 --> 00:05:55,579
every time you came over.

110
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,155
Now you're moved in,
so you get to see the real me.

111
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:00,481
Is that a problem?

112
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:02,699
No, I wouldn't want it any other way.

113
00:06:07,026 --> 00:06:09,374
Uh... when did you make
a grilled cheese?

114
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:11,394
Uh... last night after my shift.

115
00:06:11,475 --> 00:06:12,608
You were sleeping.

116
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:14,548
Mmm! Mmm.

117
00:06:17,859 --> 00:06:19,421
How are you feeling?

118
00:06:19,593 --> 00:06:20,966
Ready to get back to it.

119
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:22,371
Did you get the food I sent over?

120
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:23,809
I did.

121
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:26,593
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Well, I wanted to,

122
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,531
and eating well is crucial
for a fast recovery.

123
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:30,111
Alright.

124
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:32,776
Shake off the rust and grab a seat.

125
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:38,987
Anyone want to guess
what these numbers represent?

126
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:40,708
Nolan.

127
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:42,413
Those are the scores
to our six-month exams.

128
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,095
That is correct, Officer Nolan.

129
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:45,782
Oh! We all passed.

130
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:49,198
Technically, yes, but that 81 is ugly,

131
00:06:49,265 --> 00:06:51,749
given that an 80 is basically an F.

132
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,753
- Who got the low mark?
- Clearly not West.

133
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,102
I could tell you,
but self-reflection is necessary

134
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,107
for your success as a patrol officer.

135
00:06:59,141 --> 00:07:01,283
So I want your guesses,

136
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,485
as to which score is
yours by end of shift.

137
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:04,612
Understood?

138
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:05,380
Why not give them now?

139
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:06,705
To mess with our heads.

140
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:08,907
Are you saying you're so
easily sabotaged, Officer Nolan?

141
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,785
No, sir, I was speaking
for Officer Chen.

142
00:07:13,438 --> 00:07:14,905
Sir, will there be consequences

143
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:16,342
for the officer with the low score?

144
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:17,959
Officer Lopez, you want to take that?

145
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:19,429
At a minimum, a low score means

146
00:07:19,466 --> 00:07:21,040
merciless taunting for months.

147
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,164
- Great.
- But you three did pass,

148
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,853
so there's good news...

149
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,968
you can now wear short sleeves.

150
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:28,303
Congratulations.

151
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:32,553
Nolan.

152
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,438
Sir, who will I be riding with today?

153
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:36,943
I was thinking...

154
00:07:37,713 --> 00:07:39,314
me.

155
00:07:39,552 --> 00:07:40,985
How's that sound?

156
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:45,055
Alright.

157
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:47,440
I know I did better
than an 81, didn't I?

158
00:07:47,477 --> 00:07:49,658
- Yeah, the oral exam is the X-Factor.
- He's right.

159
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:51,826
Chief Williams could ding us
on the tiniest of mistakes,

160
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,795
which I'm sure he did with me,
and Grey knows that,

161
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:55,296
so he's gonna spend the day
torturing me.

162
00:07:55,534 --> 00:07:57,468
Or he knows you pulled the high score

163
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:58,973
and plans to torture you anyway.

164
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,414
You're lucky you don't have to worry.

165
00:08:00,524 --> 00:08:02,003
Who says I'm not worried?

166
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:03,471
You look worried.

167
00:08:03,508 --> 00:08:05,440
I have never had a rookie score
that low on the exam.

168
00:08:05,474 --> 00:08:07,175
- There's a first time for everything.
- No.

169
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:09,711
Officer Chen is
a naturalborn test-taker.

170
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:11,346
Nolan didn't even finish college.

171
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,664
Plus, Chen had me for her T.O.

172
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,032
- Nolan had Bishop.
- Really?

173
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:17,703
You're gonna smack-talk her when
she's not here to defend herself.

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,508
You're right. It's not the same.

175
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:22,013
Even if she <i>was</i> here, you'd still
be fighting for second place.

176
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,018
- What are you doing?
- What?

177
00:08:24,055 --> 00:08:25,808
My rookies wear long sleeves and ties

178
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:27,012
until the last day of probation.

179
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,188
Yeah, but Sergeant Grey said...

180
00:08:28,225 --> 00:08:30,245
Grey is not your training officer.

181
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:32,690
I have complete discretion
of the training of my boot,

182
00:08:32,727 --> 00:08:33,922
and that includes uniform.

183
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:36,204
Okay? So go change back
into your long sleeves.

184
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:38,262
And don't forget the tie.

185
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:40,450
Now, Boot.

186
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,457
- Where you going?
- To change back.

187
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,384
Can I ask you a personal question?

188
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,015
If you think it's wise.

189
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:52,555
Do things bother you less now?

190
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:54,660
No, you're just as annoying
as you were before.

191
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:56,828
Very funny. I mean the job.

192
00:08:57,026 --> 00:09:00,261
My first six months have been...
a lot to process.

193
00:09:00,296 --> 00:09:01,895
It's like a raw nerve.

194
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:05,083
"All the feelings,"
as my son's fond of saying.

195
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:08,329
Does that... get easier?

196
00:09:08,366 --> 00:09:11,068
Look, a cop has a decision
to make in the first few years.

197
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:12,507
"How much can I handle?"

198
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,566
How much I'm gonna
let the job affect me.

199
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:17,663
"If I had an input control,
where would I set it to?"

200
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,759
Some cops set it to 7.

201
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:21,337
They take a lot in.

202
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:23,535
Some... set it to 3.

203
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:24,886
Hell, some set it to zero.

204
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,548
Anybody keep it at 10?

205
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:27,818
Can't be done.

206
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:30,119
Let me see your hand.

207
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:34,614
You've been demoing your house
for about a week,

208
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:36,865
and you already got calluses growing.

209
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:39,161
Your body does that to protect itself.

210
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,200
Your mind does the same thing,

211
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:43,104
whether you want it to or not.

212
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:45,240
<i>7-Adam-15,</i>

213
00:09:45,305 --> 00:09:48,180
<i>507 at Sunset Plaza, Code 2.</i>

214
00:09:48,246 --> 00:09:50,114
7-Adam-15, copy.

215
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:51,851
Look, I'm with Wesley on this.

216
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:53,915
The shower is definitely
a beverage-only zone,

217
00:09:53,988 --> 00:09:55,572
and a soap dish is not a plate.

218
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:57,833
- Says who?
- Common decency, actually.

219
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,181
- Give me a break.
- He's right.

220
00:10:00,218 --> 00:10:02,953
I live under an overpass,
and even <i>I</i> think it's gross.

221
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,490
Hey, nobody asked you.

222
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,566
Stop pouting.

223
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:10,871
I'm not pouting.
What are we doing here?

224
00:10:10,908 --> 00:10:13,134
You thought it was gonna get
easier after you passed the exam,

225
00:10:13,169 --> 00:10:14,903
- but you were wrong.
- Awesome.

226
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:17,222
- What was that?
- Nothing.

227
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:19,340
If recent events
have taught us anything,

228
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,474
it's that we need to remain
ever-vigilant.

229
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,978
You probably think you know
everything about policing,

230
00:10:24,013 --> 00:10:25,990
but you don't, for example...

231
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:28,155
what's the most important thing
you need on the street?

232
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:29,790
Is this a trick question?

233
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:34,197
Okay, well, the easy answer is my gun,

234
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,456
but I know that's not right.

235
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:37,926
So, um... my mind?

236
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:40,126
No. That's too esoteric for you.

237
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:41,684
Are you through
not answering my question?

238
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:42,988
Uh, my judgment?

239
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:45,890
Yeah, my judgment.

240
00:10:45,927 --> 00:10:47,327
Your eyes.

241
00:10:47,503 --> 00:10:50,505
"Cop eyes" stop crime and save lives.

242
00:10:50,539 --> 00:10:52,804
Did you study explosive devices
in the Academy?

243
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:53,922
What? Yeah.

244
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,476
- I mean, a little.
- Good.

245
00:10:55,511 --> 00:10:57,538
I hope you paid attention
because I had a buddy

246
00:10:57,585 --> 00:10:59,747
from the bomb squad mock up an IED

247
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,385
and hide it somewhere
here in this park.

248
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,394
What?

249
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:04,716
You got 10 minutes to find it,

250
00:11:04,753 --> 00:11:07,505
or I'm adding the duty hat
to your standard uniform.

251
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,990
- Go.
- I...

252
00:11:10,326 --> 00:11:11,492
Go!

253
00:11:11,527 --> 00:11:12,863
10 seconds.

254
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,364
Alright, alright.
What's the problem here?

255
00:11:16,398 --> 00:11:17,802
The problem is this guy

256
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,652
trying to sell me
a colon-cleaning start-up

257
00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:21,069
while I'm eating lamb chops.

258
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:22,652
Look, Colon Glow is patent-pending.

259
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:24,636
"Make it sublime
where the sun don't shine."

260
00:11:24,673 --> 00:11:26,709
You can get in on
the ground floor for only $100K.

261
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:28,785
- You get this sort of thing a lot?
- You have no idea.

262
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:29,876
Sir, sir, sir, sir.

263
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:31,340
I admire your passion,

264
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:33,127
but you need to leave Mr. Cuban alone.

265
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:34,576
We get another complaint,

266
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:36,613
we're gonna book you
for public nuisance, okay?

267
00:11:36,651 --> 00:11:37,785
Yeah.

268
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:40,753
- Mr. Cuban, sorry.
- Yep.

269
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,090
- Nolan, let's go.
- Yes, sir.

270
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:43,404
Actually, when I was in construction,

271
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,490
I invented my own...
it's sort of a fastbinder,

272
00:11:45,527 --> 00:11:47,228
but the difference is, the heat sink...

273
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:50,431
You know what? Never mind.
You have a nice day.

274
00:12:31,748 --> 00:12:33,256
I found it.

275
00:12:35,845 --> 00:12:36,895
I found...

276
00:12:40,803 --> 00:12:42,971
And... you're dead.

277
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:46,721
Because radio frequency energy
can trigger a bomb.

278
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:49,384
You gonna forget that lesson, Boot?

279
00:12:50,239 --> 00:12:52,390
- No.
- Good.

280
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:54,474
Go get cleaned up.

281
00:13:02,036 --> 00:13:03,216
You're supposed to carry an extra

282
00:13:03,253 --> 00:13:04,835
uniform shirt in your war bag.

283
00:13:04,872 --> 00:13:07,008
Oh, yes, sir. I didn't expect
to be in short sleeves yet.

284
00:13:07,042 --> 00:13:08,543
This is the only one I own.

285
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,695
Hey.

286
00:13:11,732 --> 00:13:13,640
I ordered a new set of
dress blues last week.

287
00:13:13,677 --> 00:13:15,244
See if they're in?

288
00:13:15,351 --> 00:13:17,103
Uh, yeah. I can go look in back.

289
00:13:17,415 --> 00:13:20,183
Frank, um...
usually checks the computer.

290
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:22,156
Is he around?

291
00:13:22,191 --> 00:13:24,125
- No.
- Oh.

292
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:29,197
- Everything good?
- Yeah, it's great.

293
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:30,837
How long you been working here?

294
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:31,942
Couple weeks.

295
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,964
- What's your name?
- Uh, Justin.

296
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,323
Justin what?

297
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:39,564
He's headed for the alley.
I'll cut him off.

298
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:11,706
7-Adam-15, 211 at Top Cop Uniforms.

299
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,393
Three suspects escaping on motorcycles

300
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,231
heading north, south, and east.

301
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:17,065
Send backup and airship.

302
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,705
What'd they steal?

303
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:22,417
Police uniforms.

304
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:29,895
- How many uniforms did they take?
- About 20.

305
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:31,468
That's a lot of potential fake cops,

306
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,178
which is why you called
Homeland Security.

307
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,642
I called you as a courtesy.

308
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:37,257
In most cases, stolen uniforms
are used for drug rips.

309
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,632
Well, that's a lot of risk
just to rob a few drug dealers,

310
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,438
which is why we're going
to be treating this

311
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:43,600
as a potential high-threat-level event.

312
00:14:43,637 --> 00:14:46,173
- Like in '09 with the bus?
- Oh, God, here we go.

313
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:48,933
Jess' first year
with the FBI-LAPD Taskforce,

314
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,633
she convinced us that a missing

315
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,906
school bus was a prelude

316
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:53,183
- to a terror attack.
- Okay.

317
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:54,359
- And it wasn't?
- A third-grader

318
00:14:54,396 --> 00:14:56,101
didn't want to take a
test, so he stole the bus,

319
00:14:56,138 --> 00:14:57,340
so he wouldn't have to go to school.

320
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:58,971
- I mean...
- She had half the LAPD

321
00:14:59,008 --> 00:15:00,467
hunting a 9-year-old.

322
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:03,063
Hey, overtime paid
for my Disney World vacation.

323
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,215
- I'm not complaining.
- Okay, you know what?

324
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:05,303
You picked the <i>one</i> time

325
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,352
- that I was wrong.
- The one time?

326
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:07,830
- The one time?
- Was there body-cam footage

327
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,347
of the man inside the store?

328
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:10,784
No. The cams weren't on.

329
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:12,988
I will put him with an artist.
We will send you a sketch.

330
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:13,917
- How about that?
- Great.

331
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,088
Look, I hope you're right
about this being small-time,

332
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,260
but... I don't think it is.

333
00:15:18,463 --> 00:15:19,666
Will you walk me out?

334
00:15:19,703 --> 00:15:21,484
- Yes.
- Okay.

335
00:15:21,971 --> 00:15:23,939
Uh, is everything okay?

336
00:15:23,976 --> 00:15:25,169
Yeah. Why?

337
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:27,035
Well, you know, I mean,
it's your first day back,

338
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:29,971
- already chasing bad guys.
- Yes, well, chasing, not catching.

339
00:15:30,008 --> 00:15:31,209
Much like your 9-year-old.

340
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:32,980
Oh, I caught him.

341
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:35,006
He will not fool me again.

342
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:36,754
I'm sorry, you're still
keeping tabs on him?

343
00:15:37,907 --> 00:15:40,008
Uh, Benjamin Smith
is a sophomore at USC,

344
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:42,097
and if he ever steps
back over the line,

345
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:43,587
I'll be there.

346
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:45,159
Wow.

347
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:46,661
You terrify me.

348
00:15:50,003 --> 00:15:51,270
Missed a spot.

349
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:52,741
What?

350
00:15:57,536 --> 00:15:59,136
Thank God. My wife's missing.

351
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:00,531
She never came home from work
last night.

352
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:01,980
She always comes home.

353
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:03,657
I texted and called her friends,
and nobody's...

354
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:05,216
Okay, sir, can you please slow down?

355
00:16:05,253 --> 00:16:07,340
It's important I get the report
right for the detectives.

356
00:16:07,377 --> 00:16:10,787
- What's your wife's name?
- Susanna... Brown.

357
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:13,277
She's a clerk
at the courthouse downtown.

358
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:14,725
We're trying to have a baby,

359
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:16,954
and she was supposed
to come straight home to...

360
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:18,189
- you... you know.
- Yes, sir.

361
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:19,290
Do you have a picture?

362
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:21,125
Uh... y-yeah.

363
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,100
No, hard copy's preferable.

364
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:24,821
Of course.

365
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:26,365
Hold on.

366
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:28,472
Poor guy.

367
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:29,709
Really?

368
00:16:29,746 --> 00:16:31,502
- What?
- Cop eyes.

369
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,671
What? You... You think
the husband did something?

370
00:16:33,705 --> 00:16:35,392
You <i>always</i> assume the
husband did something.

371
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,095
Officer Bradford's
first rule of domestics?

372
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:39,355
This isn't a joke, Boot.

373
00:16:39,392 --> 00:16:41,416
You don't have the experience
to evaluate people yet,

374
00:16:41,453 --> 00:16:44,125
so your default should be
suspicion, not compassion.

375
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:46,097
Understood?

376
00:16:46,866 --> 00:16:48,105
Yeah.

377
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,899
Have I told you how sexy
you look in that uniform?

378
00:16:50,936 --> 00:16:53,016
No, most of your compliments
come after I take it off.

379
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:54,392
- Oh.
- What?

380
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:55,660
Nothing, just a little, uh...

381
00:16:55,697 --> 00:16:56,894
Really?

382
00:16:57,404 --> 00:16:58,696
You couldn't just be in the moment?

383
00:16:58,730 --> 00:16:59,797
You had to point that out?

384
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:00,721
What? You just had

385
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:02,198
a little something on your shirt.
I just...

386
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:03,968
- Hey. Ready to roll?
- Yeah.

387
00:17:05,017 --> 00:17:07,085
- I'll see you at home tonight.
- Can't wait.

388
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:11,356
Hey, is everything alright?

389
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:13,288
Fine.

390
00:17:14,822 --> 00:17:17,044
I thought living together
would be more fun.

391
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:18,394
Officer West.

392
00:17:18,483 --> 00:17:20,083
Be in the shop.

393
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:23,251
You were in the cadet program
in high school, right?

394
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:24,342
Yes, sir.

395
00:17:24,379 --> 00:17:25,677
Cadet leader all four years,

396
00:17:25,714 --> 00:17:27,093
- and in college, too.
- Good.

397
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,730
They're sending a group over
tomorrow morning.

398
00:17:28,766 --> 00:17:30,361
- I want you to talk to them.
- Yes, sir.

399
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:31,545
Happy to do it.

400
00:17:31,611 --> 00:17:33,310
Very thin lips,

401
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,392
uh, a-and two gold teeth, right here.

402
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,934
Gold teeth. Gotcha.

403
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,439
This is so cool. I've never actually
sat with a sketch artist before.

404
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:41,356
Yeah, my first time, too.
I just got hired.

405
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,859
Congrats.

406
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:45,103
Okay, that should do it.

407
00:17:45,492 --> 00:17:46,893
What do you think?

408
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:51,812
You drew <i>me.</i>

409
00:17:51,849 --> 00:17:52,956
What?

410
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,585
No. I drew what you told me.

411
00:17:54,619 --> 00:17:56,720
Yeah, except... you... didn't.

412
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:57,925
May I? If... If you just...

413
00:17:57,962 --> 00:18:00,197
Yeah, so, I said he had...

414
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:03,271
Yeah. This hair will drop down
a little more,

415
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:06,144
and I said he had deep-set eyes, right?

416
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:08,229
Very thin lips.

417
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,434
There.

418
00:18:13,791 --> 00:18:15,606
Yeah. I used to draw a lot
for my old job.

419
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,205
Got to go.

420
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:18,572
They found the bikes.

421
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,017
Great work.

422
00:18:24,744 --> 00:18:26,176
Oh, yeah, that's...

423
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:28,519
those are definitely the
motorcycles from the robbery.

424
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,808
We're not gonna get any
forensics off them now, though.

425
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,845
There's a body.

426
00:18:34,225 --> 00:18:36,339
- How can you tell?
- The smell.

427
00:18:37,181 --> 00:18:39,127
A burning body's unmistakable.

428
00:18:41,366 --> 00:18:42,499
Oh.

429
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,341
That's him. I see the teeth.

430
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,055
That's definitely the guy
from the uniform store.

431
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:53,906
Not on the crime scene! Go! Go!

432
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:01,195
7-Adam-15, change our call
to a homicide.

433
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:03,775
Send detectives and a forensics team.

434
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,818
And alert Jessica Russo at DHS.

435
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:09,800
So, they must have met up here

436
00:19:09,837 --> 00:19:11,128
after they got away, but...

437
00:19:11,162 --> 00:19:12,696
then his crew killed him?

438
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:13,970
Why?

439
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,001
Because we saw him.

440
00:19:22,002 --> 00:19:23,603
Stay here.

441
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,039
How's it going?

442
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:27,292
- He threw up.
- I...

443
00:19:27,329 --> 00:19:28,741
- Oh.
- ...couldn't help it.

444
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:30,880
It was the worst thing I've ever seen.

445
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:32,678
- And smelled.
- Yeah, well, no one can blame you.

446
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:33,924
Uh, actually...

447
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:35,726
- What?
- Never mind.

448
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,427
You know, a low score on the test,

449
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:38,896
and now I puke in front of Grey?

450
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:40,453
I'm gonna get bounced
before the end of shift.

451
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:41,997
Don't be so sure about that low score.

452
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:44,234
Tim spent the entire day making me
feel like I don't know anything.

453
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,534
Hey.

454
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:46,767
I heard you got him.

455
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:47,938
Yeah, he puked.

456
00:19:47,972 --> 00:19:49,372
Stop telling people that.

457
00:19:49,409 --> 00:19:50,607
It happens.

458
00:19:50,641 --> 00:19:52,042
To <i>you?</i>

459
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:53,332
I'm gonna go talk to Grey.

460
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:54,399
- Yes.
- Yeah.

461
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:56,880
And my mortification is complete.

462
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,547
Still think they stole the
uniforms to rob drug dealers?

463
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:01,551
Let's skip
the "I told you so" s, please.

464
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:02,964
What does your intel say?

465
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,178
Print from the store got
a positive ID on our corpse.

466
00:20:05,303 --> 00:20:06,723
Trevor Travis, 28.

467
00:20:06,758 --> 00:20:08,699
Spent 18 months in Nevada State Prison

468
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:09,836
for armed robbery.

469
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:11,467
- Known associates?
- Too many to name,

470
00:20:11,504 --> 00:20:12,805
but none in Southern California.

471
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:14,683
Well, whoever his new crew is,
they're ruthless enough

472
00:20:14,717 --> 00:20:16,419
to kill one of their own
to stop our investigation.

473
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:18,799
And whatever they're planning,
no one's gonna see it coming

474
00:20:18,836 --> 00:20:20,571
because they're all dressed as cops.

475
00:20:20,608 --> 00:20:22,906
Hell, they could be
working the scene right now.

476
00:20:23,269 --> 00:20:25,928
So, we'll implement new
identity verification protocols.

477
00:20:26,022 --> 00:20:27,110
I'll call my guys,

478
00:20:27,145 --> 00:20:29,112
have them start
an interagency task force.

479
00:20:29,147 --> 00:20:30,717
We've got to get out in front of this.

480
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,263
- We need to get in on this.
- Not gonna happen.

481
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,438
We're stuck on perimeter duty
until end of shift,

482
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:36,820
away from the action.

483
00:20:36,854 --> 00:20:40,605
Trust me, this is exactly
where you want to be.

484
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:52,557
Um, what are you doing?

485
00:20:52,694 --> 00:20:54,016
Clocking out and heading home.

486
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,839
- "Rio Bravo's" on cable.
- No, no.

487
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:58,617
Why are you treating me like
it's day 1 all over again?

488
00:20:58,654 --> 00:21:01,778
Because it is. Today was day 1
of stage 2 of your training.

489
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:03,180
So, what? Does that mean

490
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:04,654
I've lost all the respect
that I've earned?

491
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,268
You lost that
when you lied on a report.

492
00:21:06,356 --> 00:21:07,717
- What?
- I read your account

493
00:21:07,752 --> 00:21:09,456
of what happened
at the quarantine house.

494
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:10,761
O-Okay?

495
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:12,199
When I thought I was infected,

496
00:21:12,323 --> 00:21:14,364
I told you I'd rather
take my life than bleed out.

497
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:16,667
- You failed to report it.
- That's what this is about?

498
00:21:16,704 --> 00:21:19,706
Suicide ideations by a law enforcement
officer are extremely serious

499
00:21:19,743 --> 00:21:21,224
and should have been
reported immediately.

500
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,486
I was trying to protect you.

501
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:24,605
They would have put you
on leave, required therapy.

502
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:27,003
- You weren't even actually suicidal.
- Not your call!

503
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:28,318
You should have detailed everything,

504
00:21:28,352 --> 00:21:29,472
regardless of the consequences.

505
00:21:29,508 --> 00:21:30,874
Oh, yeah?

506
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:32,126
Like I should have filed a report

507
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:34,164
detailing everything you've done
to protect Isabel?

508
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:36,446
You know what?

509
00:21:36,481 --> 00:21:38,493
You wanna rake me over the coals
for the next six months,

510
00:21:38,568 --> 00:21:39,760
you go ahead.

511
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:41,885
But don't pretend like it's
because you've got some code.

512
00:21:47,204 --> 00:21:48,453
Hey.

513
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:49,931
This is gonna sound weird,

514
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:51,561
but if you see any cops
at the courthouse,

515
00:21:51,596 --> 00:21:52,956
check their credentials, okay?

516
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:54,231
Yeah, they sent an e-mail around.

517
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:56,408
- What's going on?
- Eh, I can't really say.

518
00:21:56,445 --> 00:21:58,954
What's the timer for?

519
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:00,785
Well, I wanted to discuss something,

520
00:22:00,822 --> 00:22:03,707
and I figured this would be
a controlled way to do it.

521
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:06,825
We're gonna fight using a timer?

522
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:09,305
Basically.

523
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:11,608
Okay.

524
00:22:12,743 --> 00:22:15,649
I spent an hour looking for
the remote when I got home.

525
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:17,729
- Found it under the bed.
- So?

526
00:22:17,766 --> 00:22:19,595
So the TV's in the living room.

527
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,050
Look, I've been here a week

528
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:24,316
and I have found
coffee cups, bras, PopTarts

529
00:22:24,353 --> 00:22:26,488
inside of, on top of, and underneath

530
00:22:26,525 --> 00:22:28,267
almost every surface in this house.

531
00:22:28,304 --> 00:22:29,809
Now, I'm super-glad that you feel

532
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:31,566
comfortable enough with me
to be yourself, but I...

533
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,100
- I also...
- You'd rather I was someone else?

534
00:22:33,137 --> 00:22:35,542
No. Not at all.

535
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:38,449
I just think that it's important
to set ground rules.

536
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,905
- Ground rules?
- Uh, use the timer.

537
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:42,990
You think I'm a slob.

538
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:44,181
- No.
- 'Cause I'm not a slob.

539
00:22:44,215 --> 00:22:46,383
I work my ass off in an
incredibly controlled environment,

540
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:48,251
and when I get home,
I just want to relax.

541
00:22:48,387 --> 00:22:49,482
<i>You</i> might be anal-retentive

542
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,954
and fold your underwear
in a triangle...

543
00:22:50,988 --> 00:22:53,378
which is weird, by the way...
but that's not me.

544
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,287
Folding your underwear is not weird,

545
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:58,762
and an orderly space helps <i>me</i> relax.

546
00:22:58,796 --> 00:22:59,956
There's enough chaos in the world.

547
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:01,802
- I'd rather not live in it.
- You think this is chaos?

548
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,465
- Timer.
- No, screw the timer.

549
00:23:03,502 --> 00:23:05,029
This is how I live.
I'm sorry if it upsets

550
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:06,221
your delicate sensibilities.

551
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:07,369
Wait, Angela, I-I didn't...

552
00:23:07,406 --> 00:23:08,818
You think I'm overreacting?

553
00:23:09,104 --> 00:23:10,758
You know what? I've had a long day.

554
00:23:10,795 --> 00:23:12,043
I'm going to bed.

555
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,743
You should sleep on the couch.

556
00:23:16,406 --> 00:23:18,148
I would, if I could find it.

557
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:01,636
Good morning.

558
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,377
- What's good about it?
- Uh-oh.

559
00:24:03,414 --> 00:24:05,642
Looks like somebody's stressed
about their test scores.

560
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:08,045
Yeah, well, we both think
we got the 91.

561
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,157
Which means one of us got the 81.

562
00:24:10,212 --> 00:24:11,782
Alright, take your seats.

563
00:24:12,092 --> 00:24:13,601
As expected,

564
00:24:13,638 --> 00:24:16,418
the stolen uniforms caused
a bit of paranoia out there.

565
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:19,510
Overnight, there were two fights
and a near shooting

566
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:21,558
'cause two officers
didn't recognize each other.

567
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:23,166
Alright, that being said,

568
00:24:23,203 --> 00:24:25,563
it is vital that we remain vigilant.

569
00:24:25,644 --> 00:24:26,745
Understood?

570
00:24:26,782 --> 00:24:29,031
Now, to your exam scores.

571
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,235
You all submitted your guesses
last night,

572
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,653
and none of you guessed right.

573
00:24:39,611 --> 00:24:41,245
Thank God.

574
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:45,649
Nolan, I'm sorry.

575
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:47,758
Save your concern, Officer Chen.

576
00:24:47,836 --> 00:24:50,969
Officer Nolan got the highest
score, not the lowest.

577
00:24:54,011 --> 00:24:57,143
That "honor" goes to...

578
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,011
...Officer West.

579
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:01,144
That's not possible.

580
00:25:01,181 --> 00:25:03,597
I've seen a lot of
strange things in my 20 years,

581
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:05,612
but never would I have imagined

582
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,681
that the golden boy
would tank his test.

583
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,927
But there's a... th... like, I-I...

584
00:25:10,964 --> 00:25:13,130
Uh-oh. Looks like Grey
broke your rookie.

585
00:25:14,433 --> 00:25:15,998
Shut up.

586
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,691
Ah, Agent Russo.

587
00:25:18,902 --> 00:25:20,005
You looking for me?

588
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:21,794
No. Actually, Officer Nolan.

589
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:22,996
Can you spare him for the morning?

590
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,532
I need his help running down a lead.

591
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:25,670
Nolan.

592
00:25:27,207 --> 00:25:29,100
Alright, let's go back to work.

593
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,303
- Why didn't you call me back?
- What?

594
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,907
I left you a message last night.

595
00:25:33,942 --> 00:25:35,655
Oh, well, I went to bed early.

596
00:25:35,692 --> 00:25:37,326
Okay. And then this morning?

597
00:25:37,363 --> 00:25:39,179
Did you have Sergeant Grey
assign me to you

598
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:41,081
- just so you could ask me about this?
- Mm-hmm.

599
00:25:41,115 --> 00:25:43,350
Figured I'd kill two birds
while we're running down leads.

600
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:44,952
So, why didn't you call me?

601
00:25:48,122 --> 00:25:49,370
Are you okay?

602
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:50,824
Yeah. Fine.

603
00:25:51,261 --> 00:25:53,382
It's not like it's the first time
I didn't get the highest score.

604
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,711
Dude.

605
00:25:57,217 --> 00:26:00,267
Look, um... after
the terrorist on the bus,

606
00:26:00,301 --> 00:26:02,002
I just need a little bit of time off.

607
00:26:02,253 --> 00:26:04,030
I figured I knew this stuff
backwards and forwards,

608
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:06,467
but clearly, that was a mistake.

609
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,420
Clearly, I should have kept studying.

610
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:10,811
- Jackson...
- Look, I let <i>everyone</i> down.

611
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:14,181
West, your cadets are here.

612
00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:17,165
Hey.

613
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:18,675
Sorry to make you wait.

614
00:26:19,187 --> 00:26:21,521
I am Officer Jackson West.

615
00:26:21,684 --> 00:26:24,004
I am currently
a rookie patrol officer...

616
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:26,627
although, with the score I just got,

617
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:29,196
I could be, um, mall security
in my future.

618
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:33,500
Okay.

619
00:26:33,612 --> 00:26:35,235
Um...

620
00:26:35,371 --> 00:26:36,471
Good morning.

621
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:38,137
Good morning, sir!

622
00:26:39,674 --> 00:26:41,411
Right. Um...

623
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:44,991
My whole life,

624
00:26:45,184 --> 00:26:47,452
the only thing
I ever wanted to be was a cop.

625
00:26:47,548 --> 00:26:51,084
Every class I took,
every sport I played

626
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:53,387
were all meant to make me
the best of...

627
00:26:58,858 --> 00:27:00,387
You know what?

628
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,035
No.

629
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:07,751
You are looking at a cautionary tale.

630
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:11,601
The fallout of singular focus.

631
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:16,143
You were told your entire life
to study hard, stay in school.

632
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:19,311
Look, I am living proof...

633
00:27:20,202 --> 00:27:22,064
that you need to <i>skip</i> school.

634
00:27:22,717 --> 00:27:24,842
Stop worrying about overachieving

635
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:26,913
and acing every single test.

636
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,174
You know where
the safest place to be is?

637
00:27:29,724 --> 00:27:31,778
The safest place to be...

638
00:27:33,328 --> 00:27:34,728
the middle.

639
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:38,488
Stop... sacrificing...

640
00:27:38,687 --> 00:27:40,142
and, uh...

641
00:27:42,501 --> 00:27:44,170
...start living.

642
00:27:50,647 --> 00:27:52,455
That was unexpected.

643
00:27:53,014 --> 00:27:54,257
Yeah.

644
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:59,225
Look, I'm... I'm sorry about the test.

645
00:28:01,268 --> 00:28:04,737
Tim had it made for Lucy,
but now <i>you</i> gotta wear it.

646
00:28:06,523 --> 00:28:08,210
Seems fair.

647
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:12,159
Uh, hold that, please.

648
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:13,497
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah.

649
00:28:13,945 --> 00:28:15,946
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

650
00:28:35,677 --> 00:28:37,557
Hey, are you looking for something?

651
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:40,037
Oh, yeah, um... my wallet.

652
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:41,815
Ah.

653
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,826
Did you find it?

654
00:28:55,406 --> 00:28:56,607
Yeah. Thanks.

655
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:58,265
Yeah.

656
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:00,932
What are you doing with that radio?

657
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:02,287
Hey! Stop!

658
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,882
7-Adam-19, chasing
a fake cop in the garage.

659
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:06,486
I need backup.

660
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,216
Hey! Stop!

661
00:29:31,748 --> 00:29:34,609
- And you jumped from here?
- Yes, sir.

662
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:36,647
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

663
00:29:36,681 --> 00:29:38,822
- You went right over after him?
- 'Course she did.

664
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:40,281
- I trained her.
- Mm-hmm.

665
00:29:40,318 --> 00:29:41,864
You saying this guy stole a radio?

666
00:29:41,901 --> 00:29:44,102
Uh, yes, sir, out of Car 26.

667
00:29:44,222 --> 00:29:45,971
Actually, he...
he wasn't wearing gloves.

668
00:29:46,008 --> 00:29:47,496
Maybe we can pull a print?

669
00:29:52,211 --> 00:29:54,132
Well, you're gonna
have to tell me at some point.

670
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:56,269
I was just tired, and you were...

671
00:29:57,168 --> 00:29:59,380
...you were laughing
over a burned body.

672
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:01,356
- What?
- Last night, at the crime scene.

673
00:30:01,393 --> 00:30:04,061
And after Roskin,
you now think I'm heartless?

674
00:30:04,098 --> 00:30:06,130
No. N... By no means, no. Not at all.

675
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,444
I-I get it.

676
00:30:07,478 --> 00:30:09,479
You're a cop, and you've seen
a lot of bad things,

677
00:30:09,514 --> 00:30:12,582
but nothing has ever
made me feel more like...

678
00:30:13,256 --> 00:30:14,578
a rookie.

679
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:19,430
Grey wants us to go to Channel 9.

680
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:21,261
Go for 7-Adam-15.

681
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:24,334
<i>We have a suspect
ID'd... Thomas Bernhardt.</i>

682
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,181
<i>Four possible addresses.
Sending one for you to check.</i>

683
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:30,135
And stay off the main channels.
<i>Bernhardt just stole a radio.</i>

684
00:30:30,302 --> 00:30:31,804
Copy that.

685
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:33,009
Why steal a radio?

686
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,337
You can listen to dispatch
from an app on your phone.

687
00:30:35,374 --> 00:30:38,079
Because with a radio, they can
broadcast as well as listen.

688
00:30:38,116 --> 00:30:39,961
They can feed us bad intel,

689
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:41,899
have us running all over
the city while they do...

690
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:43,602
Whatever it is they're
planning on doing.

691
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:44,804
Yep.

692
00:30:46,552 --> 00:30:48,553
That's the house.

693
00:30:50,622 --> 00:30:52,690
Wait just one second.

694
00:30:52,912 --> 00:30:54,045
What are you doing?

695
00:30:54,146 --> 00:30:56,662
Just want to run the plates
of the cars on the street.

696
00:30:56,732 --> 00:30:58,463
Be nice to know
if Bernhardt has any company.

697
00:30:58,497 --> 00:30:59,578
That's hot.

698
00:30:59,614 --> 00:31:01,326
Thank you.

699
00:31:01,363 --> 00:31:02,467
Oh, that's weird.

700
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,748
- What?
- That green car,

701
00:31:05,785 --> 00:31:07,105
belongs to a missing person.

702
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:08,473
Tim and Lucy are on the case.

703
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:11,042
7-Adam-15 to 7-Adam-19.

704
00:31:11,076 --> 00:31:13,811
We have eyes on a car
belonging to Susanna Brown.

705
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:17,021
Parked in front of
the fake cop's house?

706
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,097
<i>That's correct. Who is she?</i>

707
00:31:19,418 --> 00:31:21,640
She's a clerk
at the criminal courthouse.

708
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:23,039
Didn't come home last night.

709
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:25,076
<i>No idea how she could be
connected to our uniform thieves.</i>

710
00:31:25,113 --> 00:31:26,724
<i>Do you need backup?</i>

711
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,825
No.

712
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:30,461
- Negative, but we'll keep you posted.
<i>- Roger.</i>

713
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:33,042
Husband always did it, huh?

714
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,634
Do you have any surveillance
gear in your war bag?

715
00:31:39,978 --> 00:31:41,846
Now we can look <i>and</i> listen.

716
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:14,328
<i>It's time.</i>

717
00:32:14,431 --> 00:32:17,453
7-Adam-15,
requesting backup and SWAT...

718
00:32:17,562 --> 00:32:19,343
- 9701 St. Andrews Place...
<i>- Talk.</i>

719
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:21,345
for a hostage situation...
not for public broadcast.

720
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,649
<i>Hello, this is Susanna Brown
from Foltz Criminal Court.</i>

721
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:28,201
<i>Security code Apple-5, 2-1-4-2.</i>

722
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:30,753
<i>I have an... an urgent situation.</i>

723
00:32:30,966 --> 00:32:33,273
<i>Judge Crawford granted</i>

724
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,907
<i>an unexpected appeal
in a homicide case...</i>

725
00:32:37,096 --> 00:32:38,950
<i>and the evidence is on your truck.</i>

726
00:32:38,987 --> 00:32:40,824
<i>I need you to divert from the route.</i>

727
00:32:40,861 --> 00:32:42,359
<i>An escort will meet you there.</i>

728
00:32:42,451 --> 00:32:43,723
What is she talking about?

729
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,840
Every three months,

730
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:46,911
evidence from adjudicated trials
is destroyed

731
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:49,373
in a bonded demolition facility
up in Lancaster.

732
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:51,902
<i>This is Overwatch. Road clear ahead.</i>

733
00:32:51,938 --> 00:32:54,245
Drugs, counterfeit money,
a huge cache of weapons

734
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,414
are all transported there
by police caravan.

735
00:32:56,448 --> 00:32:58,025
That truck is driving into an ambush.

736
00:32:58,062 --> 00:32:59,930
The escort that meets it
will be full of fake cops.

737
00:32:59,967 --> 00:33:01,434
They won't hesitate
to kill that driver.

738
00:33:01,576 --> 00:33:02,976
<i>Truck 3 is diverting.</i>

739
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:05,076
<i>Copy that. SWAT will remain
with the convoy.</i>

740
00:33:05,113 --> 00:33:06,824
<i>An escort should meet you en route.</i>

741
00:33:07,015 --> 00:33:08,211
Hey, it's me.

742
00:33:08,248 --> 00:33:10,294
They're planning to hijack
the Lancaster convoy.

743
00:33:10,331 --> 00:33:12,232
- <i>Please.</i>
<i>- Okay. Copy that.</i>

744
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:15,103
<i>Please. I did what you asked.
Please just let me go.</i>

745
00:33:15,485 --> 00:33:18,373
<i>Not until they make contact
with the truck.</i>

746
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,133
As soon as that happens,
they're gonna kill her.

747
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:21,693
- We gotta get in there.
- He's in a room

748
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,812
in the middle of the house.

749
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:23,875
If we breach either door,

750
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:25,871
he's gonna shoot her first
and then come for us.

751
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:27,371
Raised foundation.

752
00:33:27,712 --> 00:33:29,630
That means there's a crawlspace
under the house.

753
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:31,541
I can use that, come up through
one of the heating vents.

754
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,584
- John, John, this is way too dangerous.
- If we wait,

755
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:35,420
- and that woman is killed...
- We need to wait for SWAT.

756
00:33:35,456 --> 00:33:38,339
- ...I won't be able to live with myself.
- No!

757
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:05,607
There it is.

758
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,070
Fake escort's already got them.

759
00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:09,107
- Can't warn the truck
driver, because our heist crew's

760
00:34:09,141 --> 00:34:11,075
jamming the signal
with their stolen radio.

761
00:34:11,321 --> 00:34:13,835
- Shouldn't we wait for backup?
- We <i>are</i> the backup.

762
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:20,398
- Oh, please, let me go!
- Shut up.

763
00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:23,062
Not until they make contact
with the truck and call back.

764
00:34:25,575 --> 00:34:27,075
Please don't hurt me.

765
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:28,545
Shut up!

766
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:31,676
Yeah?

767
00:34:31,796 --> 00:34:33,848
Sweet. I'll meet you at the rendezvous.

768
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:39,283
They got the truck.

769
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:41,684
Which means you're a loose end.

770
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:17,428
Thank you.

771
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,659
Okay. You're safe now. Okay?

772
00:35:19,988 --> 00:35:21,188
I got you. Come on.

773
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:22,585
Oh!

774
00:35:23,646 --> 00:35:25,095
Okay.

775
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,027
He's not gonna hurt you anymore.

776
00:35:33,368 --> 00:35:34,868
Okay, get ready.

777
00:35:35,215 --> 00:35:37,183
Remember, they don't know that <i>we</i> know.

778
00:35:46,547 --> 00:35:48,849
- What's the problem?
- Radios are down.

779
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:50,917
We were sent to escort the truck
back to the courthouse.

780
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:52,453
<i>Must be a mistake.</i>

781
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:54,942
<i>We're</i> the escort.
So get out of the way.

782
00:35:55,423 --> 00:35:58,198
No problem. We were headed
to lunch when we got the call.

783
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,162
- Tim?
- Yeah, I see it.

784
00:36:04,297 --> 00:36:06,366
One last thing before we go...

785
00:36:06,649 --> 00:36:08,235
real cops wear their vests
<i>under</i> their shirt.

786
00:36:38,765 --> 00:36:39,866
Get out of the car!

787
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:41,268
Facedown on the ground!

788
00:36:46,374 --> 00:36:48,061
Drop your weapon right now!

789
00:36:48,154 --> 00:36:50,468
Down on the ground,
facedown, hands apart!

790
00:36:53,466 --> 00:36:55,267
Don't you move.

791
00:36:57,244 --> 00:36:58,478
Up.

792
00:37:03,117 --> 00:37:05,018
You wanted to see me, sir?

793
00:37:06,928 --> 00:37:08,946
So, how's the golden boy

794
00:37:08,983 --> 00:37:12,405
dealing with almost failing out
of Field Training?

795
00:37:12,921 --> 00:37:14,121
Fine.

796
00:37:15,336 --> 00:37:16,570
You heard about the cadets?

797
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:21,093
I'm sorry about that, sir.

798
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:23,249
But you told us that self-reflection

799
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:25,989
was a necessary skill
for an LAPD officer.

800
00:37:26,293 --> 00:37:29,341
And I've just had
a... pretty powerful dose of it.

801
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,841
My whole life has been about
getting here,

802
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:34,187
and now that I'm in uniform,

803
00:37:34,224 --> 00:37:35,925
I realize that I'll never make it

804
00:37:35,959 --> 00:37:37,504
if I, um...

805
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:39,951
if I don't find some balance.

806
00:37:40,564 --> 00:37:43,332
Even if that means getting an 81
on a test or two.

807
00:37:43,366 --> 00:37:45,835
And, uh... I can live with that.

808
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:49,805
That's admirable,
Officer West... truly.

809
00:37:51,692 --> 00:37:53,181
But...

810
00:37:54,044 --> 00:37:57,146
see, I'm not here to help you
find balance, son.

811
00:37:58,052 --> 00:37:59,580
My job is to make sure

812
00:37:59,617 --> 00:38:01,518
you keep your head in the game
at all times,

813
00:38:01,565 --> 00:38:03,733
because lives are at stake.

814
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:07,308
So, I'm extending you in the program.

815
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:09,859
Tomorrow, you're back in long sleeves,

816
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:13,077
and your T.O. will continue
to write daily evaluations.

817
00:38:14,637 --> 00:38:15,979
For how long?

818
00:38:18,903 --> 00:38:20,002
Until I can trust you

819
00:38:20,036 --> 00:38:21,971
in front of a room
full of cadets again.

820
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,875
You're dismissed.

821
00:38:45,808 --> 00:38:47,066
Hey.

822
00:38:47,103 --> 00:38:48,203
Hey.

823
00:38:51,948 --> 00:38:53,315
What's wrong?

824
00:38:53,436 --> 00:38:54,703
Nothing.

825
00:39:03,972 --> 00:39:05,881
This is only gonna work
if we talk to each other.

826
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:07,520
You know that, right?

827
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:15,656
I've never lived with anyone before.

828
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:19,345
I've never been in love like this.

829
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:25,088
And I'm scared I'm gonna screw it up.

830
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:27,621
You won't.

831
00:39:28,276 --> 00:39:30,159
I won't let you.

832
00:39:30,196 --> 00:39:32,076
Good, 'cause we're getting a maid.

833
00:39:43,492 --> 00:39:44,716
- Hey.
- Hi.

834
00:39:44,753 --> 00:39:46,088
I'm glad you're here.

835
00:39:46,292 --> 00:39:47,872
I'm glad, um, you called.

836
00:39:47,909 --> 00:39:49,961
- Come in. Come on.
- Okay.

837
00:39:50,332 --> 00:39:53,601
Can I, um...
get you something to drink?

838
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:54,983
No. No, I'm good. Thank you.

839
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,388
I just kind of, um,
just want to talk about

840
00:39:57,425 --> 00:39:59,410
whatever it is that's bothering you.

841
00:40:00,542 --> 00:40:01,601
Fair enough.

842
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:06,992
The last six months have been
the most intense in my life.

843
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,286
I... killed a man in the line of duty,

844
00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:12,948
I watched my captain die,
I fought for my own life...

845
00:40:13,248 --> 00:40:14,814
more times than I can count.

846
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:18,440
And I felt... every second of it.

847
00:40:19,022 --> 00:40:21,651
Yesterday, you told me
I would feel less

848
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:24,093
the longer I did the job,

849
00:40:24,127 --> 00:40:26,299
and a part of me wanted that so badly.

850
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:29,081
But I can't...

851
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:30,708
go numb.

852
00:40:30,745 --> 00:40:32,133
It's not who I am,

853
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:35,439
and it's... definitely
not who I want to be.

854
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:39,936
So if I'm going to do this job,
I have to feel...

855
00:40:40,278 --> 00:40:41,674
all of it.

856
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:45,304
No matter... what it does to me.

857
00:40:47,874 --> 00:40:49,381
Damn it.

858
00:40:49,722 --> 00:40:51,356
What?

859
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,641
I just, uh... I just...

860
00:40:56,026 --> 00:40:58,019
...fell in love with you a little.

861
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,290
Wow.

862
00:41:01,406 --> 00:41:02,865
Is that a bad thing?

863
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:04,875
I don't know yet.

864
00:41:06,169 --> 00:41:08,750
I think now's a good...
I'm gonna come right in for a...

865
00:41:13,743 --> 00:41:15,835
Do you wanna, um...

866
00:41:16,993 --> 00:41:19,061
Do you wanna fool around?

867
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:22,694
Yes... I... do.

868
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,041
Mm.

Uh, my place.

872
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,859
I'm not taking my clothes off here.

873

But you know what?

You can choose your house

Wait!
