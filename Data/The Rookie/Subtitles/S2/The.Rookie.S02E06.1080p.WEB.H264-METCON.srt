1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,209
All jewelry must be removed
by the arresting officer.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,650
Do I have your permission
to proceed?

3
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,459
Hey.

4
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,039
Happy Half-Year Anniversary.

5
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,579
That's not a thing.

6
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,379
Well, maybe not for
cynical police officers,

7
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,619
but for tender-hearted lawyers,

8
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,749
it's totally a thing.

9
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,079
But, hey, if you don't want
to go to n/naka tonight, eh...

10
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,829
You got a reservation?

11
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,169
You need to make those
like six...

12
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,419
Six months in advance. I know.

13
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,710
I love your confidence.

14
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,079
Wait.

15
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,330
We've only been dating
for five months.

16
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,329
Yeah, well, technically, but...

17
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,619
Did you make that reservation
for someone else

18
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,880
and hope I wouldn't remember
exactly when we hooked up?

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,999
If I say yes,
are you gonna say no?

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,169
Are you kidding?
I would kill to eat there.

21
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,959
But I'm gonna require

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,879
some serious shower time...

23
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,670
Oh... for you to make amends.

24
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,709
Deal. Yeah.

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,169
Whoa. Okay.

26
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,169
We've got a problem.

27
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,879
I just got an invitation
to a wedding.

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,329
Yeah. I don't do weddings.

29
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,919
I don't know what that means,

30
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,999
and I wasn't inviting you.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,539
Um, Lucy got
the same invitation.

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,379
The couple getting married
is her ex-boyfriend

33
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,119
and her ex-best friend.
Let me guess.

34
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,669
They hooked up while Lucy
was still dating him.

35
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,959
Living with him. Mm.

36
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,079
She's obviously devastated,

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,379
so maybe take it easy
on her today.

38
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,379
Look, Chen is my rookie,
not my friend.

39
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,539
My job is to train her,

40
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,540
not help her through
her messy social life.

41
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,789
Fine.
I'll dial it down, like, 2%.

42
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,000
That's my guy.

43
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,619
It is hot as the surface
of the sun out there.

44
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,249
Yep.
Gonna be like that all week.

45
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,999
Good thing we're all
in short sleeves now.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,169
The uniforms are still wool.

47
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,999
Today's gonna be a nightmare.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,419
I'm just saying...

49
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,289
I don't get out of the car
for less than a felony

50
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,789
when the needle hits 100.

51
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,879
Your commitment to protecting
and serving is admirable.

52
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,459
As long as I can do it
in comfort.

53
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,169
You know the front row's
for the rookies, right?

54
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,789
You hoping I'll sit by you?

55
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,079
I'm just telling you how it is.

56
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,329
The day I need that from you

57
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,530
is the day I hang up my spurs.

58
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,999
You know you're losing, right?

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,039
Good morning.

60
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,079
We've got ourselves a heat wave,

61
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,419
which means what, Officer West?

62
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,169
Studies show
that a 1% loss of body mass

63
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,459
due to sweating

64
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,959
decreases cognitive ability

65
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,619
and increases anxiety levels.

66
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,329
Translation...
Tempers will be short,

67
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,959
drug and alcohol use up,

68
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,709
so stay hydrated and stay sharp.

69
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,499
Now, while the rest of you
are baking in the sun,

70
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,499
Officer Nolan
will be flop-sweating

71
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,790
in his very first
preliminary court hearing.

72
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,959
Oh, no flop sweats here, sir.

73
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,329
I have reviewed
the arrest report repeatedly.

74
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,079
I am 100% ready to testify
on all the facts.

75
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,709
Hmm. Bradford?

76
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,249
When did you graduate
the Academy?

77
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,879
Oh, that was September...
Exact date, Boot.

78
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,879
What's your weapon's
serial number?

79
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,879
I don't know the... You need
to know the number by heart.

80
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,959
For a DUI arrest?
I didn't even draw my weapon.

81
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,379
If you don't even have your
personal information squared away,

82
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,539
how could you possibly know
the facts of the case?

83
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,329
A defense attorney's job
is to screw you up on the stand

84
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,249
by any means necessary.

85
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,249
Which means
everything that connects

86
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,289
to your experience on the job
is in bounds.

87
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,619
Got it?

88
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,330
Yes, sir.

89
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,289
You're driving today, Boot.
What?

90
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,919
You heard me. Why?

91
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,420
Look, if you don't want to...
N-No, no. I do.

92
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,419
What's the catch?
Why does there have to be a catch?

93
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,620
There's always a catch.
Not today.

94
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,119
Well, that can't be legal.

95
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,960
It's not. Light him up.

96
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,289
You're not coming?

97
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,210
It's a low-risk misdemeanor.
You got this.

98
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,960
Ahh.

99
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,499
Hey. Hi.

100
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,039
What are you doing here?

101
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,419
Well, it's your first time
in court.

102
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,669
I thought you'd...
You'd appreciate

103
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,829
a friendly face in the gallery.

104
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,379
Well, thank God.

105
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,289
At roll call this morning,
Grey had me freaked out.

106
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,499
He told me this was
predetermined to be a disaster.

107
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,579
The first one always is.

108
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,959
Was yours?

109
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,619
Ugh. Especially mine.

110
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,959
Good morning.

111
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,829
Wesley. Whoa.

112
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,119
You got a case on the docket today?
Yep. Yours.

113
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,619
Defense counsel ate
some bad lamb last night,

114
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,789
asked me to step in.
Outstanding.

115
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,999
N-Not about the... the lamb,

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,419
but that... that it's...
That it's you.

117
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,879
He's a little nervous.

118
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,669
It's his first time in court.

119
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,749
Yeah. I get it.
My first time was disastrous.

120
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,789
Look, I'll try to make it
as painless as possible, okay?

121
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,039
Thank you very much.

122
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,669
Hey, just remember...

123
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,329
Whatever happens,
it's not personal.

124
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:58,289
Right.

125
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,079
What does that mean?

126
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,420
That I'm the only
friendly face here.

127
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,879
That's my guy,
the one with the ponytail,

128
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,750
Brant Reggie, 23-152, DUI Drugs.

129
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,379
How do I know
the guy next to him?

130
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,709
Oh, that's, um,
Oscar Hutchinson.

131
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,119
He was one of the prison bus
escapees we tracked down.

132
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,459
He's kind of the reason
we're together.

133
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,379
How romantic.

134
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,709
Good morning.

135
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,289
We've got a lot of cases
to get through today,

136
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,539
so let's just jump right in.

137
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,499
Uh, hi. Uh...

138
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,209
Mr. Hutchinson, you've been
in my courtroom enough

139
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,709
to know that this isn't a Q&A.

140
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,039
Yes, Your Honor.

141
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,289
I just wanted to say
I don't mind going last.

142
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,879
I think these men beside me

143
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,539
deserve to be heard from first.

144
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,209
And you're in no hurry
to go back in the hole.

145
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,919
Interrupt me again,
and I'll have you gagged.

146
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,499
Call the first case.

147
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,829
People of
the State of California

148
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,169
versus Jonathan Ryland,

149
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,210
homicide in the first degree.

150
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,539
Is everything okay?

151
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,330
That man killed our son.

152
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,880
I'm so sorry.

153
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,079
Thank you, sir.
Color's all off, man.

154
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,329
It's not even the right color green.
What's up, Amari?

155
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,539
Man, this fool took
a counterfeit $100

156
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,620
without even checking it.

157
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,169
They misspelled it "hunderd."

158
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:46,459
Don't get me started.

159
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,579
You got a description for us?

160
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,790
Oh, better.

161
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,789
Come on. You took a $100 bill
from this clown?

162
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,039
How long ago was he here?

163
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,249
30 minutes or so.

164
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,079
I was at couple's counseling.

165
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,539
Everything alright
with you and Serena?

166
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,039
You know how it is.
Baby's teething.

167
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,539
We're not sleeping.
I'm working long hours.

168
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,749
Yeah. Well, look,
hang in there, alright?

169
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,329
Yeah.

170
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,709
Look, we'll put a BOLO out,
cruise the neighborhood.

171
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,999
Hopefully we spot him. Thanks.

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,289
Oh, hey,
I'm still out $100, though.

173
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:18,250
Uh, unfortunately, yes.

174
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,959
You should've gloved up when you
touched the counterfeit bill

175
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,289
in case we needed
to pull prints.

176
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,209
You're right. Um, I spaced.

177
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:29,829
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,879
Wait.

179
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,789
Why didn't you say anything
when we were inside?

180
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,669
No reason.

181
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:38,539
You always call me out
in front of people

182
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,919
when I screw up.

183
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,709
First you let me drive,
now this?

184
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,170
Why are you being nice to me today?
I'm not.

185
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,960
Did Rachel talk to you?

186
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:51,289
She did. I told her not to.

187
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,709
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

188
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,079
I didn't want her to, either.

189
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,119
Look, this isn't a big deal.

190
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,379
You know, I... I'm over him,

191
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,829
and I'm... I'm happy for them.

192
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,709
So I don't need any special
treatment from you, okay?

193
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,289
Okay.

194
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,539
Then I'm driving.

195
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,290
What? But...

196
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,749
Hey. You called 911?

197
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,999
Yeah. I was hooking up the car,

198
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,459
and I caught a whiff
of something really bad

199
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,420
coming from that warehouse.

200
00:09:17,421 --> 00:09:19,290
Alright.
I'll check it out. Thanks.

201
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,790
Whew. God.

202
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,169
7-L-14, possible DB at location.

203
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,000
Stand by for confirmation.

204
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,919
Hey. Can I call you right back?

205
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,829
What?

206
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,419
You said visitation was set.

207
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,539
I changed my schedule.

208
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,499
I haven't seen my daughter
in over a week.

209
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,499
Look, I don't want to play nice.

210
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,540
I want my kid.

211
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,830
I got to call you right back.

212
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,249
7-L-14, DB on scene.

213
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,379
I need homicide
and forensic team.

214
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,670
But first,
I need animal control.

215
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,829
Officer Nolan, did you have
training at the Academy

216
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,579
for DUI suspects? Uh, yes, sir.

217
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,249
40 hours of alcohol
intoxication recognition.

218
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,669
Did they test you
on that training?

219
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:05,709
Of course.

220
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,000
And did you score 100%?

221
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,829
No, but I...

222
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,039
Okay, so, on the date
in question...

223
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,379
March 16th. Yes. That date.

224
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,459
Did you see my client
behind the wheel?

225
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,579
N-No. Your client was
already out of the car

226
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,169
by the time we arrived on scene,

227
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,669
but the driver of the vehicle
he hit... Allegedly hit.

228
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,619
And please only answer
the questions that I ask you.

229
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,669
Now, did you get fingerprints
from the steering wheel

230
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,419
to prove that my client
was the driver?

231
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,919
No, but the other driver...

232
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,209
The other driver,
as you call him,

233
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,539
suffered a head injury.

234
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,209
Are you telling me
that you identified my client

235
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:38,790
based solely on
that man's say-so?

236
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,499
Your client owns the car.

237
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,249
Your Honor, can you please
instruct the witness

238
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,289
to answer my question?

239
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,539
Officer. Yeah. Uh, yes.

240
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,999
I ID'd your client
as the driver of the vehicle

241
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,459
based on the witness statement.

242
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,580
Okay.

243
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,459
How could I have known
he wasn't wearing pants?

244
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,459
No, not just pants...
Bottoms of any kind.

245
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,290
I'll never be able
to unsee that.

246
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,710
Whoa! My man, close it up.

247
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,289
You think I'm being stupid,

248
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,169
letting that invitation
bother me.

249
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,579
You said
it wasn't bothering you,

250
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,829
and I was relieved we didn't
have to talk about it.

251
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,079
Why the hell would they
invite me to their wedding?

252
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,670
To further humiliate me?

253
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,749
Maybe they're trying to make amends.
Amends.

254
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,079
By making me
starve myself for a month

255
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,749
so I can fit into
a drop-dead sexy dress and...

256
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,709
Hey. Up ahead.

257
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,790
That's the counterfeit guy.

258
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,580
Hey! Hands on the hood.
Let's go.

259
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,920
Alright. Spread your legs apart.

260
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,580
This can't be real.

261
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:25,170
- It's the emergency...
- Look. You think this is real?

262
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,210
What's happening?

263
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,250
Go! Go! Go! Come on!
We got to get out of here!

264
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,289
What do we do? Let him go.

265
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,710
We got to get
back to the station.

266
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,079
Order! Order in my court!

267
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,119
Order! Order!

268
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,379
Everyone, be still!

269
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,079
Clearly, we can't continue,
given the missile alert.

270
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,959
Deputy, take the prisoners
back to holding.

271
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,040
Let's go. Come on. Screw that.
There's a nuke coming!

272
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,169
Got anything?

273
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,459
The... The lines
are already jammed.

274
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,749
People are panicking.

275
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,289
We got to help them out.
Should we evacuate?

276
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,420
No. No. Um...

277
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,329
Hey, hey, everybody. Excuse me.

278
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,539
Everyone, if I can have
your attention, please.

279
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,419
Uh, I'm Jessica Russo,
Department of Homeland Security.

280
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,669
Now, I haven't gotten
in touch with my office,

281
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,829
but there is a good chance
that this is not real.

282
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,119
That's right. That's right.

283
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,419
There was a false missile alert

284
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,829
out of Hawaii just last year.

285
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,749
There's no need to panic.

286
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,119
What if it's not fake?

287
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,459
Well, then you got
about 28 minutes

288
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,379
until you find out
what Hell feels like.

289
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,539
Okay, that kind of talk
isn't helping anything.

290
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,039
The DHS has scenarios
planned for this situation.

291
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,829
We have. Yes, we have.

292
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:14,580
And, um, the most likely target
is downtown.

293
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,169
- Where we are.
- Okay. Wait!

294
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,000
Order.

295
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,619
Wait! Wait!

296
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,619
The blast radius is likely
between 10 to 15 miles.

297
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,789
And with an impact expected
in 27 minutes,

298
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:29,329
there isn't enough time
to get far enough away,

299
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,919
which is why we need
to get underground.

300
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,419
Judge, sir, i-is...

301
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,749
Is there a bomb shelter
in this building?

302
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,169
No, but the holding cells
are downstairs.

303
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,749
Let's go.
I hate to break it to you,

304
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,579
but those cells leak
when it rains.

305
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,619
They're not gonna do squat
in a nuclear attack.

306
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,749
Okay...

307
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,750
Now. Come on. Let's go.

308
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,040
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

309
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,540
Damn it.

310
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,000
Here goes nothing.

311
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,789
Listen up.

312
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,919
LAPD has not been able
to verify the alert is real.

313
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,419
However, real or not,

314
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,419
everyone in the city
is panicking right now.

315
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,879
So I don't care if you've been
off the street for 20 years.

316
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,879
If you got a badge,
get out there.

317
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,499
First priority...
To secure sensitive targets.

318
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,079
Next, protect the community.

319
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,709
Ignore petty crimes.

320
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,329
Focus on people, not property.

321
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,419
Look, I know you're scared.
I'm scared, too.

322
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,039
But people out there
are counting on us,

323
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,579
and we will help them.

324
00:16:58,580 --> 00:16:59,879
Yeah.

325
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,120
Okay, let's get to work.

326
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,879
What can I do? Stay here.

327
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,919
If this is real,
there's a place to seek shelter

328
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,249
in the parking garage.

329
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,499
Stay with me.

330
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,119
I can't.

331
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,879
I'm the guy
that catches the nuke.

332
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,119
It's actually
a pretty prestigious assignment.

333
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,539
You're an idiot.

334
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,920
Thanks.

335
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,709
The world could be ending.

336
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,379
I don't think anybody's gonna
begrudge you a little PDA.

337
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,960
Come here.

338
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,880
I'll see you later. You better.

339
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,619
Why is everyone running around, Mommy?
We're having a drill,

340
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,499
like we were having at school
when I picked you up.

341
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,879
But then why does
everyone look so scared?

342
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,879
Because
they're good actors, baby.

343
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,669
Detective,
why aren't you on the street?

344
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,540
'Cause I need to take care
of my daughter.

345
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,169
Understood.

346
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,749
Hi, there.

347
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,249
I'm Sergeant Grey.

348
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,329
Lila. Nice to meet you, Lila.

349
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,919
Do you mind if I talk
to your mom for a minute?

350
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,709
Sure.

351
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,579
Uh, go get a snack
from the machine, baby. Okay?

352
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,209
Um, I can help her.

353
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,830
Thank you. Of course.

354
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,119
Is it real?

355
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,999
I don't know.

356
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,539
Tell me...
How was the traffic coming in?

357
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,900
Any chance for people
to get clear?

358
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,750
No.

359
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,620
Why don't you just
let us go, man?

360
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:45,999
It's the end of the world.

361
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,289
Give us a few minutes
of freedom.

362
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,289
Don't make us die in these chains.
Shut up, Oscar.

363
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:51,249
You're not getting out of those cuffs.
We ain't asking.

364
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,960
Back up. Back up.
Right now. Right now.

365
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,789
Hey, um,
I can't get a hold of Angela.

366
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,330
Can I use your radio? Yeah.

367
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,499
7-Adam-07, go to channel 15.

368
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,040
Just turn the dial on top.
Thank you.

369
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,709
Angela, it's me.

370
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,669
Wesley? Hey, how's it going?

371
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,669
Oh, you know, pretty good
for the end of the world.

372
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,709
I'm bummed we're gonna miss
our reservation.

373
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,959
Look, we're not.
This is just a false alarm.

374
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,119
Okay? Yeah.

375
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,709
Hey. You alright?

376
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:25,879
There's a bomb shelter
at the public school

377
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,329
two blocks west, alright?
Head there.

378
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,709
Where are you?

379
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,539
I'm at the courthouse with Nolan

380
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,879
and Jessica and a bunch
of scared people.

381
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,169
Two blocks west. Head there.

382
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:34,690
Are you going down
to the bomb shelter?

383
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,459
Judge Stevens
said there isn't one.

384
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,709
Criminal courthouse on Spring?
Yeah.

385
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,249
There's definitely
a fallout shelter.

386
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,620
I was down there once
as a rookie.

387
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,499
Hey.

388
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,499
Nolan.

389
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,580
Angela says this place
does have a bomb shelter.

390
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,250
Are you safe where you are?

391
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,079
Angela. Are you still there?

392
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,120
Yeah. I'm heading underground.

393
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,459
Okay. I love you.

394
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,000
Love you, too.

395
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,709
The judge is gone.

396
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,919
So is the ADA, the...
The bailiff,

397
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,619
and a bunch of other people
from the gallery.

398
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,329
What's happening?

399
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:24,540
The judge lied to us
about the bomb shelter.

400
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,539
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

401
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,879
Step back. What are you doing?

402
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,750
What I have to.

403
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,829
- Back up. I'm closing this door.
- And what about the rest of us?

404
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:45,169
If she's right about the nuke,
then this is ground zero.

405
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,169
Won't be safe
to go outside for weeks.

406
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,459
We don't have the supplies
in here for all of you.

407
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,669
So you're gonna kill a cop
and all these others

408
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,959
just to save yourselves?

409
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,879
And the rest of you...
You're all good with that?!

410
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,329
I'm not gonna tell you again.

411
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,499
Back up
so I can close this door.

412
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,750
Okay. Okay, fine.
You win. I give up.

413
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,379
Pretty cool, right?

414
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,080
They taught me that
at the Academy.

415
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,749
Come on.

416
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,329
You're making a big mistake.

417
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,749
And you're under arrest.
Sit down right there.

418
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,249
Get cozy.

419
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,999
Here we go. Come in.

420
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,210
Hands.

421
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,959
No, no, no! Not him!

422
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,619
Hey. They're human beings
with rights.

423
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,379
He killed our boy in cold blood.

424
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,039
Aw. You better back up, mami,

425
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,749
or you'll be next. You...

426
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,329
- Get off me!
- Okay. Alright. Alright.

427
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,789
- Hey. Take it easy.
- Hey, hey, hey!

428
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,329
Alright, we're not leaving
anyone outside, okay?

429
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,539
So everyone back up.
Here we go. Come on.

430
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,749
Back up. Let's get these
prisoners over to the back here.

431
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,419
We can segregate them
on the benches.

432
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,419
Here. Take that.

433
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,579
Folks, in this way. Keep moving.

434
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,670
Go ahead and sit down, sir.

435
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:47,289
Is that everyone? Thank you.

436
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,960
Alright.

437
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,379
Be a lot more comfortable
without this chain, you know?

438
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,789
We can keep the cuffs on.
Don't push your luck, Oscar.

439
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,580
Ah, that's all I know how to do.

440
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,879
There's barely any air
moving in here at all.

441
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,709
Well, the judge
was right about one thing.

442
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,249
With this many people in here,

443
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,879
these supplies
won't even last a week.

444
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,289
I'm surprised
we haven't gotten an update.

445
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,750
Control, 7-Adam-15. Come in.

446
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,919
Control?

447
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,499
No bars. Alright.

448
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,879
So, we know radio frequencies
and mobile signals

449
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,209
are blocked by the shelter.

450
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:44,170
Let's hope it does as well
against radiation.

451
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,910
This thing hasn't worked
since the Reagan administration.

452
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,670
So, now all we can do is wait.

453
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,039
13 minutes.

454
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,329
Stop checking the time.

455
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,879
Are you serious?

456
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,419
We're about to be burned up
by a giant fireball.

457
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,169
"A," no, we're not.
It's a false alarm.

458
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,669
And, "B,"
counting down the minutes

459
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,829
wouldn't accomplish anything,
even if it was real.

460
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,119
So, what, you just want me
to think about something else?

461
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,709
Pretty much. Can't be done.

462
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:22,000
Really?

463
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,499
Okay.

464
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,579
How would you sabotage
that wedding?

465
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,419
What?

466
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,919
Don't tell me you didn't
lie awake all night

467
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,539
fantasizing about it.
I... I didn't.

468
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,539
Lying to me in your last moments
on Earth is a bad look.

469
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,459
You said it was a false alarm.

470
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,079
Fine.

471
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,419
I'd cancel the rehearsal dinner,

472
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,579
change the registry
to a bondage Web store,

473
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,879
pay a gang of clowns
to storm their wedding,

474
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,999
and hire a chopper to fly over
their outdoor reception,

475
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,419
see how well
their wedding cake stands up

476
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,789
to the rotor wash of
a Sikorsky helicopter.

477
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,880
Didn't think about it, huh?

478
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,919
How is revenge what
we're focusing on right now?

479
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,169
It's tangible, okay?
You can hold on to it.

480
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,789
Imminent nuclear death
is totally unrelatable.

481
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,329
Now, speaking of revenge,

482
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:07,829
I have a friend at USC
who studies cockroaches.

483
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:09,419
I'm sure he could
loan you a few hundred

484
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,670
to release at the wedding.

485
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,079
Mommy, what's really going on?

486
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,789
I told you, honey. It's a drill.

487
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,669
Please don't lie.

488
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,039
Daddy says that's why
we can't see you anymore.

489
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,120
Don't you want
to tell the truth?

490
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,789
Of course I do, honey. I...

491
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,379
I just...

492
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,829
My previous job,
I had to lie a lot...

493
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,919
to fool criminals, so...

494
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,499
Why do you want to fool me?

495
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,959
Are you mad at me?

496
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,209
Of course not. No, honey.

497
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:54,080
I, um... I love you.

498
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,459
I'll make you a deal.

499
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,329
I'll stop sleeping
with a night light

500
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,919
if you tell the truth, okay?

501
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,250
Okay.

502
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,749
And here I thought the most
stressful part of my day

503
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,829
would be going to court.

504
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,499
At least we're together.

505
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,460
Yeah.

506
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,879
Thank you for coming
to support me.

507
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,330
You're welcome.

508
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,539
Can I, um...

509
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,169
Can I confess something?

510
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,039
You were already here
for a meeting.

511
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,329
You knew?

512
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,710
Yeah, but it didn't matter.

513
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,379
10 minutes.

514
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,919
We still have time to get
to the fallout shelter

515
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,209
at the courthouse,
hook up with Wesley.

516
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,789
Yeah, maybe we should,
just to be safe.

517
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,119
All hail Children of the Stars.

518
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,879
The worthy will
ascend into the heavens!

519
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,459
All hail Children of the Stars.
We are not going to the shelter, are we?

520
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,669
We will wait for your
arrival, Noon Star Harvesters.

521
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,910
All hail Children of the Stars.

522
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,209
Today the saviors
will gather our souls.

523
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,039
All hail Children of the Stars.

524
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,539
The worthy
will ascend into the heavens.

525
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,829
All hail Children of the Stars.
Hey!

526
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,539
We await your arrival...
How about you come down from there?

527
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,039
Noon Star Harvesters.

528
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,749
All hail Children of the Stars.
No.

529
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,379
It's almost our time,
but there's nothing to fear.

530
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,749
This was all prophesized...

531
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,919
"Like a clarion call,"

532
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,749
word shall spread
of Our Saviors From Above.

533
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,329
Heed ye
the Noon Star Harvesters,

534
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:56,169
for they shall descend
from the heavens

535
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,619
"so The Worthy can ascend."

536
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,119
So sayeth The Prophet Jedediah.

537
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,619
All hail Children of the Stars.

538
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,419
Okay. So, you're saying the
missile... Isn't a missile.

539
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,499
It is a cloak behind which
our saviors will come to us,

540
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,879
and we will step out to meet
them at the appointed time,

541
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,289
ascending into
their interstellar embrace.

542
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:15,710
All hail Children of the Stars.

543
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,499
Today the Saviors will...

544
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,709
So, they're clearly crazy.
Can we go now?

545
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:23,119
All hail Children of the Stars.
You can.

546
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,619
But I'm not leaving until I get
them down off that ledge.

547
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,619
All hail Children of the Stars. Yeah, but if the
missile's real, it won't matter if they jump.

548
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,209
And if it's not?

549
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,829
We wait for your arrival,
Noon Star Harvesters.

550
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,709
All hail Children of the Stars.

551
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,379
Today the Saviors will
gather our souls. Okay.

552
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:38,329
I mean, but they're
true believers.

553
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,879
How are we gonna get through
to them in nine minutes?

554
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,619
I'm open to suggestions.

555
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,209
All hail Children of the Stars.

556
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,379
Get out of here!

557
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,919
Put... Put it down!

558
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,169
Get... Get out! Get out!

559
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,790
Put it down! Put it down!

560
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,079
- Amari, it's Tim!
- Bradford?!

561
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,379
Yeah. You alright?

562
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,579
Yeah, but Lewis took a bottle
to the head.

563
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,289
Alright,
just put down the shotgun.

564
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,329
They're robbing me.
I got to protect my store.

565
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:06,420
We're here now, so put it down.

566
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,039
Put it on the counter.
Put it down.

567
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,790
Okay. O-Okay. Alright.

568
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,620
Now we're coming in.

569
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,710
Check him out.

570
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,119
Hey. Let me see. Ohh.

571
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,329
Okay, you're gonna need
stitches,

572
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,789
but it's nothing
life-threatening.

573
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,119
Keep pressure on it.

574
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,499
Why don't you take him around
the corner to your house?

575
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,209
No, I-I-I can't leave my store.

576
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,079
It's just stuff, Amari.
The missile is coming, alright?

577
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,459
You should be with your family.

578
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,379
Yeah, but if it's not,
I'll lose everything.

579
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,669
No wonder you need counseling.

580
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,079
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

581
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,579
It means that nothing
is more important

582
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,700
than the people you love,
and they need you right now.

583
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,920
We'll take care of your shop.

584
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,999
O-Okay.

585
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,579
Alright, come on.
Let's get him up. Okay.

586
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,459
You're right. You're right.

587
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,380
Thank you. Let's go. Come on.

588
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,169
Busted.

589
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,960
How much time we got left?

590
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,420
Enough.

591
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,380
Uh, I'm not a whiskey girl.

592
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,879
To the end of the world.

593
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,670
Whenever that may be.

594
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,619
This shelter
was built in the '50s.

595
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,669
Now, nukes are 10 times
as powerful today.

596
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,959
Odds are good that this building
collapses when the blast hits.

597
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Shut up, Oscar.

598
00:29:34,961 --> 00:29:36,789
It's basic science, my man.

599
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,329
Try not to sound
so happy about it.

600
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:39,499
What can I say? I'm a happy guy.

601
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,789
Not like mami over here.

602
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,579
So sad.

603
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,379
Don't you laugh at our grief.

604
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,619
He's trying to provoke you.
Don't let him.

605
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,749
You got me all wrong, Counselor.

606
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,999
What we have here is
a cathartic opportunity.

607
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,039
Two paths...
Forgiveness or revenge.

608
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,249
Oh, three, three paths.

609
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,039
I forgot.
I forgot about the missile.

610
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,169
Oh, I ain't looking
for forgiveness.

611
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,829
And little papi over there

612
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:08,209
can try for revenge if he likes.

613
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,119
But he'll just end up
in the ground like his kid.

614
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,960
You...

615
00:30:10,961 --> 00:30:12,290
Come here!

616
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:14,789
How dare you!

617
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,790
Sit down. Shut up.

618
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:17,959
Sit down now. Sit down.

619
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,419
It's okay. He's not worth it.

620
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,789
One more word
out of any of them,

621
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,829
we're gagging them all.
Happy to.

622
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,620
One more word.

623
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,039
You okay?

624
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,210
No.

625
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:43,169
Today the Saviors
will gather our souls.

626
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,459
All hail Children of the Stars.

627
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,709
The worthy will ascend
into the heavens.

628
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,789
All hail Children of the Stars.
Excuse me.

629
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,039
I hate to interrupt.

630
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,619
I just have a question.

631
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,459
The time for questions is done.

632
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,670
Totally. I just...

633
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,669
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Hold on.

634
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,119
Hold on. Who's Jedediah?

635
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,379
You mentioned him earlier.

636
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,539
He is the prophet

637
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:05,169
who helped us cast away
our earthly possessions

638
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,170
and see the truth.

639
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,209
About the aliens?

640
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,829
They're not aliens.

641
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,249
They're spirits
from another universe.

642
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,749
And where is he? Jedediah.

643
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,379
He's joining us in the heavens.

644
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,619
Does that mean
he's on another rooftop?

645
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,169
No. This is the one true spot,

646
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:23,749
where... where the chosen
will ascend.

647
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:25,580
And yet he's not here.

648
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,250
What's your name?

649
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,499
Aurora.

650
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,829
How old are you, Aurora?

651
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,039
19.

652
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,289
It is the age of the chosen.

653
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,289
Aren't you scared?

654
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,670
No, I'm at peace. It's just...

655
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,169
I don't like heights.

656
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,289
I don't blame you.
It's a long way down.

657
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:50,120
So why do you have to step
off the roof to ascend?

658
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,249
'Cause that's the way it must be.
Why?

659
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,539
The spirits love you. Oh, yes.

660
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,289
And they're traveling
all this way to save you.

661
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:00,079
Do you think they really care
how you meet them,

662
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,540
as long as you do it
with open arms?

663
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,499
It is a test to our faith.

664
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,879
There is no doubt
you have faith, all of you.

665
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,999
So come down now,

666
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,620
and we'll wait for them together
on solid ground.

667
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,380
I promise it'll be okay.

668
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,579
Sgt. Grey: Attention, all units.

669
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,959
Missile alert is a false alarm.

670
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,209
I repeat... the alert is a false alarm.
Oh, thank God.

671
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,709
What does...
What does that mean?

672
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,830
It means they're not coming.

673
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,379
The danger's over. Okay?

674
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,789
Okay.

675
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,230
Does that mean
Daddy'll be here soon?

676
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,329
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I know, right?

677
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,579
- Crazy today.
- This was unbelievable.

678
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,829
Oh, you know what?

679
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,079
Honey, I will be right back.

680
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,119
Hey. Hi.

681
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,039
Um thanks for watching my kid.

682
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,119
Oh, my pleasure.

683
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,289
She's super cute.

684
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:13,210
Thanks.

685
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:14,619
Uh, hey, listen.

686
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,959
You work for Social Services,
right?

687
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,249
I do.

688
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,289
Can I ask you
a theoretical question?

689
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,879
Sure.

690
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,579
Okay, say, uh,
there's a divorced couple

691
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,579
and, uh, the dad
has sole custody

692
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,879
and the mom
has supervised visitations

693
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,499
and an emergency comes up

694
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,209
and she can't
get in touch with him...

695
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,459
So she picks her super cute
daughter up from school

696
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,619
to keep her safe.

697
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,169
Yeah.

698
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,790
Is that bad?

699
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,959
To the court, it's not good.

700
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:49,619
You know that technically
it's a parental abduction.

701
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,669
Yeah, but even given
the circumstances?

702
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,539
I'm not saying a judge wouldn't
take it into consideration,

703
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,709
but if the factors that led
to the visitation restrictions

704
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,879
are serious enough,

705
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,669
it won't matter.

706
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,539
You could lose
all access to her.

707
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,709
Harper,
have you heard from Nolan?

708
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,289
He's the only cop
that hasn't checked in.

709
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,789
What?

710
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,249
Officer Nolan. Your rookie?

711
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,330
Have you heard from him?

712
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,250
No, sir, I-I haven't talked
to him since this morning.

713
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,790
One minute.

714
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,959
Will we know when it hits?

715
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,169
Yeah. We'll feel the shock wave
and likely some heat.

716
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,330
Hopefully not too much heat.

717
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,540
30 seconds.

718
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,920
Ohh!

719
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,710
Prisoner secured!

720
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:29,170
Nolan.

721
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,750
Everybody, be calm.

722
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,119
Thanks for the diversion, buddy.

723
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,879
Let the judge go. Sure I will,

724
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,499
just as soon as I'm outside.

725
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,999
What about the missile?
Well, if it's real,

726
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,419
I'm not gonna feel it anyways.

727
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,039
I'm just gonna wink
right out of existence.

728
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,999
I don't want to spend the rest
of my days in solitary.

729
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,670
If you even twitch,
I'm gonna cut your carotid.

730
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,790
No! Don't open it!

731
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,079
Hey.

732
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,710
Ugh!

733
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,360
Looks like you'll be spending
some time in solitary after all.

734
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,539
So, no missile? False alarm.

735
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,780
Heat wave caused a malfunction
at Edwards Air Force Base.

736
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,499
Where's Wesley?

737
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,540
I don't know. He was just here.

738
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,330
Wesley.

739
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,039
Oh, my God.

740
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,539
Get an ambulance!

741
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,539
Oh, my God. It's okay, baby.

742
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,780
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

743
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,579
35-year-old male
in hypovolemic shock,

744
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,959
stab wound to the left chest,
possible pneumothorax.

745
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,829
Alert the O.R.
This guy's jumping the line.

746
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,749
- We've got him from here.
- Is he gonna be okay?

747
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,539
It depends on the extent
of the internal damage,

748
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,879
but we're gonna do
everything we can.

749
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,000
Sorry. I've got to go.

750
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,999
You can't really
blame a guy for trying.

751
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,209
To commit a felony?

752
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,169
It's literally what I do
for a living.

753
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,289
Was it all just a game to you?

754
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,419
Did you feel any fear at all?

755
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,620
Honestly? No.

756
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,209
Guys like me
are wired differently.

757
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:33,459
I don't really do fear
or anxiety.

758
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,539
On the flip side,
I have really poor impulse control.

759
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,539
He, you think
I could get a soda?

760
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,329
No.
Donovan: Is my daughter here?

761
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:43,209
Where's my daughter?
Where is she? Lila!

762
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,119
What's going on?
My daughter... Lila.

763
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,080
Please tell me she's here.

764
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:47,209
Daddy!

765
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:48,500
Oh, God.

766
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,579
Are you okay, baby? Yeah.

767
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,329
Mommy picked me up at school
'cause of the missile,

768
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,789
but it's not real.

769
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,119
I-I was trying to get
in touch with you...

770
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,249
You had no right!

771
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,209
I showed up, and she was gone.

772
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,539
The school was closed.
I had no idea where she was!

773
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,499
Sir, I understand your fear,
but your child was safe here.

774
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,919
Y-You don't understand.

775
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,499
She has no custody rights.
She kidnapped my kid.

776
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,420
I did not... No, no, no, no.
I want her arrested.

777
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,039
Daddy, no.

778
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,919
Sir, with all due respect,
I think you're overreacting.

779
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,209
I'm what? When you consider
everything that happened...

780
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,999
I-I don't care.
This is the last straw.

781
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,829
She said things had changed,
that she had changed,

782
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,670
but it was just another lie.
No, it wasn't.

783
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,459
How the hell would you know?

784
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,619
Because she's here,

785
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,999
back in uniform, training me.

786
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,419
I couldn't figure out why
until just this moment.

787
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,169
I mean, she had a golden ticket.

788
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,789
She could have gone anywhere
in the department,

789
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,289
anywhere she wanted.

790
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:41,039
So, why the hell
would she get back in blues

791
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,709
and spend her days
training a guy like me?

792
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:46,669
I knew whatever the reason was,
it had to be primal,

793
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:50,250
powerful enough to... overcome
her inherent arrogance.

794
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,289
And now I see your daughter,
and I see exactly why

795
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,459
she's willing to sacrifice
what she does best

796
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,829
for the person
she loves the most.

797
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,789
Please, Daddy.

798
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,960
I made her promise...
No more lying.

799
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,120
It's true.

800
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:14,249
I'm trying here, Don.

801
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,959
I have been lost,

802
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,379
and I am trying
to find my way back.

803
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,710
And I am gonna make mistakes.

804
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,959
And I'm gonna
fall on my face a lot.

805
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,579
But when that alert came in,

806
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,579
the only thing
I could think about

807
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,579
was making sure
that she was safe.

808
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:33,080
That is the only thing
that matters to me now.

809
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,879
Okay.

810
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,619
Okay.

811
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,120
Let's go home.

812
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,120
Go hug your mama.

813
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,750
I love you, cutie. Okay?

814
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:27,749
Seems like a great kid.

815
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,710
Yeah. She is.

816
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,999
Hey. Sure I can't
get you something?

817
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,539
I'm fine.

818
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,329
What's taking so long?

819
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,169
So, do you want me
to talk to my buddy

820
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:48,579
about the cockroaches?

821
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,749
No, thanks.

822
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:53,209
After today, I've decided that
I'm okay with the wedding.

823
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,209
I know they seem really happy.

824
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,829
And truth be told,
I was only with him

825
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,459
because I couldn't afford
to move out.

826
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,329
And she knew that, so...

827
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,379
Does that mean
we're going to the wedding?

828
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:05,999
No, but I might
get them a present.

829
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,169
With a roach in it? Maybe.

830
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,829
You are a bad influence.

831
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,829
Love you, too. Bye.

832
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,459
So, Henry says hello

833
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,419
and that I should move
the hell out of Los Angeles.

834
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,169
That's a smart kid.
What'd you tell him?

835
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,829
That there was never
any real danger

836
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,079
because you had my back.

837
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,420
And your front.

838
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,709
- Hey.
- Hey.

839
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,039
I hope it's okay that I'm here.

840
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,669
Yeah.

841
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:33,919
How's Wesley?

842
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,620
We're waiting to find out.
Join us.

843
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,379
Is he okay?

844
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,419
The surgery went well.

845
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,999
The doctor repaired his lung.

846
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,039
As long as there are
no complications,

847
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,749
he should make a full recovery.
Thank you.

848
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,539
They'll move him into ICU
in a few hours.

849
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,170
I'll come get you
so you can see him.

850
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,790
He's gonna be okay.
