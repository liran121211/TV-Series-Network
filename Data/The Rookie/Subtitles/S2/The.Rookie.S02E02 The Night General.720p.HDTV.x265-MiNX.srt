1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,460
Okay, here we are.

2
00:00:06,586 --> 00:00:08,486
Thank you for being
our designated driver.

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:10,188
Oh, I figured you needed
to blow off a little steam

4
00:00:10,223 --> 00:00:11,440
after the week you had.

5
00:00:11,477 --> 00:00:12,900
Forget about being left back.

6
00:00:12,937 --> 00:00:14,596
You just need to make
peace with being back

7
00:00:14,633 --> 00:00:16,299
in long sleeves, I have.

8
00:00:16,336 --> 00:00:17,416
No, you haven't.

9
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,607
No, I haven't.

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,073
Oh, guys.

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,964
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

12
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:35,367
This if off-duty officer
Jackson West, badge 33356.

13
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,301
I need a unit to my home

14
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:38,645
for an on-view suspect
dealing eleven-three.

15
00:00:38,682 --> 00:00:40,791
I'm gonna cut around
the back side, cut 'em off.

16
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:47,546
Police. Get down on the ground,

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,949
keep your hands where I can see them.

18
00:00:49,038 --> 00:00:50,319
Foot pursuit! Westbound in the alley!

19
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,317
Suspect's a male, white,
5'10", 200 pounds.

20
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:01,324
Suspect in custody.

21
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,230
Yo, you slinging dope
in my neighborhood?

22
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:07,839
Mr. Wilson?

23
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:08,960
Oh, hey, Jackson.

24
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:10,223
You know this guy?

25
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:11,334
Yeah, he's my landlord.

26
00:01:29,498 --> 00:01:30,978
You ever heard of a Night General?

27
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:32,535
No, sir.

28
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:34,406
Night General Detectives.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,115
They respond to any major crime scene

30
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:37,453
after normal business hours.

31
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,499
They work the case until it's assigned.

32
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,000
They have to be a master in everything

33
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,216
because they see everything.

34
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:43,921
- Sounds impressive.
- It is.

35
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:45,478
And most of them got
the attitude to go with it.

36
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:47,828
This my tour guide?

37
00:01:47,926 --> 00:01:49,287
I thought you were
assigning me a rookie.

38
00:01:49,323 --> 00:01:51,719
I am a rookie, sir. John Nolan.

39
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:53,841
Nick Armstrong.

40
00:01:53,992 --> 00:01:56,293
Detective Armstrong
is our new Night Detective.

41
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,515
He asked for a patrol officer
to show him around,

42
00:01:58,552 --> 00:01:59,968
help him get familiar
with our division.

43
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:02,041
Yeah, I just did a ten spot
up in the seven-seven,

44
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:04,078
so I don't know none of the
players in this part of town.

45
00:02:04,127 --> 00:02:06,274
Hell, I don't know where
to get a decent cup of coffee.

46
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:08,533
Well, I got you covered on the coffee.

47
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,868
I'll do my best on the rest.

48
00:02:10,168 --> 00:02:11,276
Fair enough.

49
00:02:11,313 --> 00:02:13,137
Alright, it's roll call time.
You want to come?

50
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,727
Yeah. First day of school,

51
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:15,932
might as well meet the other kids.

52
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,570
Were you Night General
back at the seven-seven?

53
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:18,916
Yeah. Last five years.

54
00:02:18,953 --> 00:02:20,845
After my wife died,
I found the nights the hardest,

55
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,643
- so I filled 'em.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

56
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,182
- Married?
- Divorced.

57
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:26,221
- Before or after you signed up?
- Before.

58
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:27,626
Part of the catalyst
to make the change.

59
00:02:27,663 --> 00:02:29,153
Change is hard. I hate it, man.

60
00:02:29,188 --> 00:02:30,855
- But here I am.
- Life is contradictory.

61
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,629
- Tell me about it.
- Settle down. Find a seat.

62
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:35,762
First up,

63
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:38,801
I'd like to congratulate
Officer Jackson West

64
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:40,105
on the fine pinch last night.

65
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,035
No crook is safe from Officer West,

66
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,287
not even his landlord.

67
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:47,305
- Letter of commendation?
- Change of address form.

68
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:49,908
Your apartment is now considered
a "house of ill repute."..

69
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:52,037
...and under asset seizure.

70
00:02:52,074 --> 00:02:53,876
We need your new address by tomorrow,

71
00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:55,545
even if it's Mama's house.

72
00:02:55,636 --> 00:02:56,693
Alright.

73
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,895
This sharp-dressed man in the doorway

74
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:01,386
is Detective Nick Armstrong.

75
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:02,820
He'll be in the field after hours

76
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:04,188
for your detecting needs.

77
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:05,764
Yes, Officer Lopez?

78
00:03:05,858 --> 00:03:08,226
Detective Armstrong,
on a scale of 1 to 10,

79
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,946
where 1 is "patrol friendly"

80
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:11,859
and 10 is "making us guard a cleared
crime scene"

81
00:03:11,896 --> 00:03:13,273
in the pouring rain 'cause you get

82
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,872
"a power trip off of it,"

83
00:03:14,934 --> 00:03:16,327
where do you stand?

84
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:18,689
- Lopez.
- No, it's alright, Sarge.

85
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:21,076
I appreciate a direct question.

86
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:23,562
A lot of cops take off the uniform,
they put on the suit.

87
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,452
Suddenly, they think they're better
than the officers in this room.

88
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:27,610
I'm not one of them.

89
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:29,553
Patrol is where it all happens.

90
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:32,232
It's fast, honest, pure, raw.

91
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:36,020
85% of all crimes are solved
at the patrol level.

92
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:39,924
So, the way I see it,
I am here to help you,

93
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,209
not the other way around.

94
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:43,203
And if that doesn't win you over,

95
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:45,997
I have five dozen of the finest
donuts in the break room.

96
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:48,433
That's all I'm saying.

97
00:03:48,568 --> 00:03:51,470
Detective, you think you can
buy us with donuts?

98
00:03:51,536 --> 00:03:52,970
Absolutely not.

99
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:54,918
Maybe rent you, though.

100
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:59,600
Okay, are we done?
Good, 'cause we're done.

101
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:01,078
Be safe out there.

102
00:04:01,568 --> 00:04:03,836
Bradford, let me see you a sec.

103
00:04:06,986 --> 00:04:08,252
Chief Williams added another book

104
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:10,121
to your Sergeants Exam reading list.

105
00:04:10,206 --> 00:04:11,450
"Split Second Leadership:"

106
00:04:11,487 --> 00:04:13,424
"Leading Men In The Line Of Duty."

107
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,059
- Men?
- It's from the '60s.

108
00:04:15,094 --> 00:04:17,290
How is this relevant
to 21st-century policing?

109
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:20,264
Ours is not to reason why,
Officer Bradford.

110
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:21,765
Read the book.

111
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:23,924
Yes, sir.

112
00:04:26,443 --> 00:04:28,103
Sergeant Grey is setting me up to fail.

113
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,583
- You see that, right?
- No. I really don't.

114
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:31,936
Come on, there's no way I'm gonna find

115
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:33,179
someplace to live in one day.

116
00:04:33,224 --> 00:04:35,013
Not with that attitude.

117
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,315
7 to 10 days would be
a reasonable amount of time.

118
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,044
It's at the sergeant's discretion.

119
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:40,717
Just like sticking me
back in long sleeves

120
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:41,924
was at his discretion.

121
00:04:41,998 --> 00:04:43,358
You know, I know two guys
from the academy

122
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:45,361
who both got 80s,
and they're both in short sleeves.

123
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:47,752
Why's he penalizing me?

124
00:04:47,796 --> 00:04:49,486
You know, I think I liked you better,

125
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,634
when you were a coward.

126
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:51,996
You complained less.

127
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:56,373
If I have to suffer, so do you.

128
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:58,758
So, you're gonna read this
out loud to me between calls.

129
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,713
Only way I'm gonna get it
memorized in time.

130
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,277
Or I could drive

131
00:05:02,314 --> 00:05:03,982
and you could read it to yourself.

132
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:05,813
Nice try. Start reading.

133
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:08,247
Okay.

134
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:09,812
"Chapter One."

135
00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:13,324
"True leadership generates
respect, not fear."

136
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:15,946
"It elevates people,
rather than diminishing them."

137
00:05:15,988 --> 00:05:17,678
I like this book.

138
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:19,338
You would.

139
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:20,718
Keep reading.

140
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,624
"The number-one mistake
new leaders make"

141
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:25,363
"is to think themselves
suddenly infallible."

142
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:28,966
"The best leaders understand that
even the lowliest patrol officer"

143
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:31,601
"has something valuable to teach them."

144
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:33,949
Repeat that last part back to me.

145
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:37,413
Memorizing is all about repetition.

146
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,976
Trust me. I'm a psych major.

147
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:40,545
I-I know this stuff.

148
00:05:40,851 --> 00:05:43,478
The best leaders understand that
even the lowliest patrol officer

149
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:45,316
has something valuable to teach them.

150
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,799
Again.

151
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:48,958
<i>7-Adam-19,</i>

152
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:51,721
<i>family disturbance at 217 Evergreen.</i>

153
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:53,052
Thank God.

154
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:55,247
7-Adam-19, copy. En route.

155
00:05:55,561 --> 00:05:58,096
Okay, ETA three minutes.
Time to read some more.

156
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,665
"An open mind and an open door."..

157
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:03,101
And that's why phase three recruits

158
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:04,787
all have tan left arms.

159
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,071
I am not gonna lie,

160
00:06:07,106 --> 00:06:10,274
the change to short sleeves
has been life-altering.

161
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:12,765
I remember it well.

162
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,935
Then I quickly, uh, moved into suits.

163
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:17,200
I mean, it's not as hot as wool,

164
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:19,450
but it's not cool, either.

165
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:21,719
How long did it take you
to make the move?

166
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,521
What? Uh, detective? Four years.

167
00:06:25,181 --> 00:06:26,386
I didn't think that was possible.

168
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:28,025
Yeah, well, I'm still
the only cop who's done it.

169
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,294
But I still wonder if I...
if I moved too quickly.

170
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:32,697
Well, speaking as someone
who wants to move up rapidly,

171
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:34,198
I am officially your number-one fan.

172
00:06:34,233 --> 00:06:36,002
If there's any hints you can dispense,

173
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:37,104
I am all ears.

174
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:38,778
You hook me up on the local 411,

175
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,463
and I'll dispense a little knowledge.

176
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:42,041
Deal.

177
00:06:42,112 --> 00:06:44,143
<i>All units, incoming four-fifteen.</i>

178
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,276
<i>Shaw Memorial.</i>

179
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,987
<i>Security fighting with unknown male.</i>

180
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:49,015
I haven't been in a fight in a while.

181
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:50,414
Buy that call.

182
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:51,749
Let's go get in some trouble.

183
00:06:51,784 --> 00:06:53,495
- Sure.
- Here we go.

184
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:55,052
They're gonna kill each other!

185
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:56,854
My boys... they bought
these military vests

186
00:06:56,891 --> 00:06:57,997
off the Internet,

187
00:06:58,034 --> 00:06:59,457
and they wanna try them out!

188
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:02,181
- Bulletproof vests?
- Oh, I hope so.

189
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:03,297
They won't listen to me.

190
00:07:03,334 --> 00:07:04,355
- Maybe you'll listen to them.
- Ma'am, get in the house.

191
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:06,103
- I called the cops.
- Put the guns down!

192
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,301
- Put them down!
- 3, 2, 1.

193
00:07:07,338 --> 00:07:08,603
Drop your weapons!

194
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:11,636
Oh, my God!

195
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,304
- Stay in the house.
- See, I told you they'd work.

196
00:07:13,338 --> 00:07:14,939
- Drop the guns right now!
- Drop your weapon now!

197
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:16,533
- Relax.
- We were just messing around.

198
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:18,422
J-Bag bet me the vests wouldn't work.

199
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:21,301
You been drinking,

200
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:22,977
or are you normally this stupid?

201
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:24,448
Get up.

202
00:07:24,483 --> 00:07:26,022
I-I don't feel so good.

203
00:07:26,775 --> 00:07:28,452
Tim.

204
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:29,762
- Tim.
- Look at you!

205
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,489
You guys never listen
to what I'm saying.

206
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:33,167
- I won the bet.
- What bet? He's dying!

207
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:35,030
It doesn't matter!
It was his idea to buy the vests!

208
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:36,788
7-Adam-19. I need an ambulance.

209
00:07:36,843 --> 00:07:39,124
- Gunshot wound to the upper torso.
- Mom, go back in the house!

210
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,233
He's bleeding. What are you doing here?

211
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:43,060
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

212
00:07:43,097 --> 00:07:44,831
Just came in on a 5150 hold.

213
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:46,504
He got loose. He's high on something.

214
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:48,006
Whoa.

215
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:53,427
Hey, big guy. Hey.

216
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:55,931
We don't want anybody
hurting you, okay?

217
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:57,913
Tase him, tase him, tase him!

218
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,732
Come on, big guy. Come on.

219
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,636
- Grace?
- John?

220
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:30,237
I'm open to ideas.

221
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:39,286
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

222
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:41,458
Yeah, I probably should
have... stretched before that.

223
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:44,083
How long have you been a cop?

224
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,087
- Six months.
- You're kidding me.

225
00:08:46,124 --> 00:08:48,044
I mean, they didn't let me
touch a patient for three years.

226
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,469
Oh, well, I think LAPD puts value on

227
00:08:50,506 --> 00:08:51,640
"on the job" training.

228
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:53,681
I thought you were gonna be a painter.

229
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:55,878
I mean, things happened, so...

230
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,083
What did you give him,
and can I get some?

231
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:02,179
Detective Armstrong, this is Grace.

232
00:09:02,214 --> 00:09:03,335
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

233
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:05,309
- How do you know Nolan?
- We went to college together.

234
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:06,433
Briefly.

235
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,294
Gunshot victim coming in!

236
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:10,811
Good seeing you again, John.

237
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:12,082
Nice to meet you, Detective.

238
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,550
Nice to meet you.

239
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,450
This the first time
you've seen her since?

240
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:17,815
Yeah.

241
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,290
She looks good.

242
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,200
Come on. Yep.

243
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:24,367
Come on.

244
00:09:24,903 --> 00:09:26,771
No.

245
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,397
Come on. Come on.

246
00:09:31,677 --> 00:09:32,743
Hey, West.

247
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:34,145
What's up?

248
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,541
You find a place to live yet?

249
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:37,921
Smitty, it's only been,
like, two hours.

250
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,075
After you book your DUI,
meet me at the west gate.

251
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:44,075
Ohh.

252
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,896
Smitty?

253
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:03,247
Jackson. Welcome home.

254
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:04,844
- Home?
- That's right.

255
00:10:04,942 --> 00:10:07,153
You have a chance to stay
at the best-kept secret

256
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,528
in the LAPD...

257
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,794
Shangri-La Westgate.

258
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,651
Low maintenance, zero commute,

259
00:10:13,685 --> 00:10:15,937
and a vacation is easy as

260
00:10:15,974 --> 00:10:18,106
"Gentlemen, start your engines."

261
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:20,344
Smitty, you live in
the police station parking lot.

262
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,036
I even have the password
to the coffee shop WiFi.

263
00:10:24,193 --> 00:10:25,411
Baller, isn't it?

264
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:27,088
"Baller" is not the first word
that comes to mind,

265
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:29,627
and not one that sounds good
coming out of your mouth.

266
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:32,042
But... you know what?

267
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,479
This actually is
something that might...

268
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:34,331
Boot!

269
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:36,456
I told you to meet me at the shop!

270
00:10:37,242 --> 00:10:39,977
$400 a month, zero security deposit.

271
00:10:40,012 --> 00:10:42,446
- We got a deal?
- Let's go!

272
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:45,542
Let me get back to you.

273
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,255
Alright, so, what's the deal
with Dr. Grace?

274
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:51,807
What do you mean?

275
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:53,410
Mm, noticed a little
something-something,

276
00:10:53,447 --> 00:10:54,554
under the surface.

277
00:10:54,807 --> 00:10:56,096
You didn't catch it?

278
00:10:56,792 --> 00:11:00,063
No, but I was, uh,
a little preoccupied.

279
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,269
You know, surprise,
adrenaline, head trauma.

280
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:05,085
Okay.

281
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,585
What... What do you think it was?

282
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,372
Hey, I... No idea. No idea.

283
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:11,575
<i>7-Adam-15,
manually activated panic alarm.</i>

284
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,310
<i>Multiple distress activations.</i>

285
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:15,880
7-Adam-15, responding.

286
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:17,735
Code 2 High.

287
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,309
Is it locked?

288
00:11:23,422 --> 00:11:25,309
Let's try the side of the house first.

289
00:11:38,016 --> 00:11:39,305
Hey.

290
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:41,011
Look.

291
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:45,776
Police! Come on out!

292
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,377
Show me your hands!

293
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:50,284
I got you. I got you.

294
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:51,712
It's okay. Oh, oh, oh.

295
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:53,737
- Alright.
- They have Jeff.

296
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:54,883
They have our son.

297
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,600
- There's... There's two of them.
- Shh. It's okay.

298
00:11:56,636 --> 00:11:58,289
- They're upstairs.
- How long ago?

299
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:00,024
Uh, 20 minutes, half hour.

300
00:12:00,058 --> 00:12:02,610
Home invasion, possible 207.
We're clearing the house now.

301
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:04,648
- Stay here.
- Okay. Okay.

302
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:40,898
Clear!

303
00:12:53,478 --> 00:12:54,945
Jeff?

304
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:58,415
- No.
- I'm sorry.

305
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,678
No! Jeff!

306
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:07,546
- God...
- I'm sorry.

307
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,509
So, what do we've got?

308
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:13,040
Our victim's name is Jeff Christian,
17 years old.

309
00:13:13,077 --> 00:13:14,884
Apparent gunshot wound to the back.

310
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,618
- Any others?
- Yeah.

311
00:13:16,802 --> 00:13:18,547
Matt and Marilyn Christian. Parents.

312
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:20,814
Both assaulted,
described two masked assailants.

313
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:22,583
Males, white, maybe Hispanic.

314
00:13:22,617 --> 00:13:25,653
5'9 " to 5'11", medium build.

315
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:28,923
Uh, the primary wore white
sneakers with a red triangle.

316
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:30,658
I already put out a BOLO citywide.

317
00:13:30,787 --> 00:13:32,748
Can I tell you,
it's nice to have a detective here,

318
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:33,885
- from the get-go.
- Yeah.

319
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:36,497
Now, you want the on-call
homicide dicks to respond?

320
00:13:36,531 --> 00:13:37,873
Nah, I'll take this one.

321
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,631
Anything special you want
them to pay attention to?

322
00:13:39,668 --> 00:13:40,989
Uh, there was a piece
of electrical tape

323
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:42,713
covering the doorbell camera.

324
00:13:44,697 --> 00:13:46,076
Hey.

325
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,339
75% of cops would have
missed that tape.

326
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:50,467
That's a nice spot, Officer Nolan.

327
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:52,356
You want to work with me on this one?

328
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,790
Yes, sir, I do.

329
00:13:53,893 --> 00:13:55,880
Good. Come on.

330
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,522
Mr. and Mrs. Christian, I...

331
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:04,556
I am, uh...

332
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:08,833
I'm sorry.

333
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:11,356
All I can offer is a promise.

334
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:14,633
I will hunt the men who did this.

335
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:17,471
I will hunt them
to the ends of the Earth,

336
00:14:17,505 --> 00:14:20,174
and I will not stop until I find them.

337
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:23,765
If there's anything you need,
the LAPD is here for you.

338
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:25,303
Thank you.

339
00:14:26,581 --> 00:14:28,215
Would you excuse us?

340
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:37,453
What do we got?

341
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,809
Is that a puncture wound on the elbow?

342
00:14:39,894 --> 00:14:42,359
Yeah. Entry wound.

343
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:44,431
The bullet entered the elbow,

344
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,203
probably bounced off the humerus bone,

345
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,368
severed the brachial,

346
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:49,797
and then came out of the back.

347
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:53,774
What's this fluid in his mouth?

348
00:14:53,808 --> 00:14:56,481
Pulmonary edema, but let's
let the coroner handle that.

349
00:14:56,518 --> 00:14:57,845
Any sign of struggle?

350
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,410
Uh...

351
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:01,675
Not really, but...

352
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,992
how does someone get shot in the elbow?

353
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,140
Reaching for a loaded gun.

354
00:15:06,177 --> 00:15:08,197
But what does lunging
for a gun suggest?

355
00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:09,590
- He was fighting back.
- Eventually,

356
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:11,193
but why wait so long?

357
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,591
- Was he trying to reason with them?
- Maybe.

358
00:15:13,628 --> 00:15:15,560
But maybe shooting the kid
wasn't the original plan,

359
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:16,930
but once he grabbed the gun...

360
00:15:16,969 --> 00:15:18,399
Bang. No choice.

361
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:20,645
But why are they in this room?

362
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:22,302
The master bedroom,
the parents' room...

363
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:24,038
that's where all the expensive stuff is.

364
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,910
But here...

365
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:30,611
Wait a minute.

366
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,810
Cubby hole.

367
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:40,353
Prescription pills.

368
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,693
Yeah.

369
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:45,290
I'm gonna have to let the lab confirm,

370
00:15:45,327 --> 00:15:47,695
but I'm saying that's Oxycontin.

371
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:49,284
You think maybe this
was the real target?

372
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:51,056
See that piece of plastic on that nail?

373
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:52,966
The baggie probably ripped
when they pulled it out,

374
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:54,591
and they lost a few pills.

375
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:56,637
So that explains what
they were doing up here.

376
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,405
So, what do we do next?

377
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:01,930
Uh... we dig into Jeff's past,

378
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:03,244
find out everybody he knew.

379
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:05,412
Two of those people either
killed him or know who did.

380
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,861
Perfect.

381
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,082
The suspect pool just shrunk

382
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:10,396
from the whole world to about 200 now.

383
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,295
Eliminate women, the very tall,
short, young, old...

384
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:14,855
we're talking maybe 50 names.

385
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:17,024
We could have these guys
ID'd before dinner.

386
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:21,432
Good move, pulling me
away from Smitty's RV.

387
00:16:21,469 --> 00:16:22,979
He just dropped the rent
a hundred bucks.

388
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,484
Yeah, my dad always said
the only true negotiating power

389
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:26,904
is the ability to walk away.

390
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:29,100
Smitty's Shangri-La
is where cops go to die.

391
00:16:29,137 --> 00:16:30,537
That's one way of looking at it.

392
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,940
And the other is that it's freedom,

393
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:34,439
model of efficiency.

394
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,943
No commute, cheap rent.

395
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,133
You can spin it all you want.

396
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,291
Doesn't change the fact that it's

397
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:40,325
another step in the wrong direction.

398
00:16:40,882 --> 00:16:42,516
Why not just move back in
with your folks

399
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,641
while you look for a place?

400
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:45,354
Talk about the wrong direction.

401
00:16:45,553 --> 00:16:47,654
'Cause you haven't told your
dad about your test score?

402
00:16:47,832 --> 00:16:49,515
No.

403
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:54,226
Alright, fine. Fine.

404
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,458
I'll stay at home tonight,

405
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:57,351
but only 'cause it'll get Smitty

406
00:16:57,388 --> 00:16:58,565
to knock down the rent even more.

407
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,953
Just like that,
we're back where we started.

408
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:02,540
"Chapter Three."

409
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:04,471
"The healthy habits of command."

410
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:05,973
"Delegation is the key"

411
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:07,733
"to leading men in times of stress."

412
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:10,417
"Don't ever think you can carry
the load all by yourself."

413
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:12,088
That is so true. Don't you think?

414
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,186
It's hard enough to listen to it
without you editorializing.

415
00:17:14,223 --> 00:17:16,559
Hey, I'm happy to stop reading
and catch up on paperwork.

416
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:18,587
You're gonna have to
re-read all of this anyway

417
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:20,300
- to really memorize it.
- No.

418
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:21,904
I memorize best when I hear it.

419
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,631
- Really?
- Yeah.

420
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:24,699
Huh.

421
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:26,244
- Why?
- Nothing. I...

422
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:28,427
Boot.

423
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:30,777
You might have a learning difference.

424
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,032
A what?

425
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:35,002
Technically, it's classified
as a disability,

426
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:36,851
but it really just means that you're

427
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,368
wired to process
information differently.

428
00:17:38,404 --> 00:17:41,041
In your case, through... through
hearing rather than reading.

429
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:42,509
I don't have a learning disability.

430
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:44,070
A lot of people have them.

431
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:46,113
I bet Isabel helped you in the Academy,

432
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:47,724
read through the materials
with you and stuff.

433
00:17:47,761 --> 00:17:49,256
We're not talking about this.

434
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:51,164
<i>7-Adam-19, suspicious person.</i>

435
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:53,587
<i>Unknown male sitting in a red minivan.</i>

436
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:56,023
<i>Possibly casing at 1966 Keegan Street.</i>

437
00:17:56,057 --> 00:17:58,250
7-Adam-19, show us responding.

438
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:00,284
All I'm saying is...

439
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:04,224
Never mind.

440
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:20,447
Let's talk on the sidewalk.

441
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:26,359
Rex?

442
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,785
You're still chasing bounty?

443
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,458
I thought you moved to Reno.

444
00:18:29,565 --> 00:18:31,498
All my bail jumpers come to L.A.

445
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:32,775
I got a tip one of 'em's
down the street

446
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:33,894
staying at his aunt's place.

447
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:36,779
We got three 911 calls
about a weirdo in a minivan.

448
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,899
- Casing.
- Watch your tone, Boot.

449
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,070
Oh, you don't get to
call her "Boot," Rex.

450
00:18:41,107 --> 00:18:42,211
You're retired.

451
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:43,273
She's the police now.

452
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,689
Let's see your bail bonds license

453
00:18:44,726 --> 00:18:46,027
and the warrant on your jumper.

454
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:47,998
You let her talk to you like that?

455
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:57,638
Nico Sandoval. Attempted murder?

456
00:18:57,743 --> 00:18:59,070
Okay, you need to call dispatch

457
00:18:59,107 --> 00:19:00,307
and let us know when you're out here.

458
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,381
- This guy sounds dangerous.
- Uh, I've been Code 5

459
00:19:02,418 --> 00:19:03,522
on dangerous men since

460
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:04,719
before you were born, little lady.

461
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:06,797
Well, in this century,
you notify local law enforcement

462
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:09,196
so when you get in the weeds,
we know who's out here.

463
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,832
I don't call for help.
Help calls for me.

464
00:19:11,866 --> 00:19:13,663
Maybe you need to let this guy
read your book.

465
00:19:13,731 --> 00:19:15,731
Rex, if you're gonna be out here,
you gotta play by the rules.

466
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:16,837
Ah, come on, Tim.

467
00:19:16,871 --> 00:19:17,965
I call this in,

468
00:19:18,002 --> 00:19:19,993
someone's gonna snatch my bounty.

469
00:19:23,892 --> 00:19:25,426
I need that money.

470
00:19:27,882 --> 00:19:30,606
Nico shows, you give us a call.

471
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:32,795
No one's gonna "snatch your bounty."

472
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:35,525
Alright.

473
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:38,249
It's good to see you, Rex.

474
00:19:38,286 --> 00:19:39,960
It's good seeing you, too, Tim.

475
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,647
Detective Armstrong.

476
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:44,064
I spoke to some of Jeff's friends.

477
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:47,374
Turns out he did a stint
in rehab three months ago.

478
00:19:47,432 --> 00:19:48,735
Wow.

479
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:51,036
Funny how his family
failed to mention that,

480
00:19:51,073 --> 00:19:53,787
and that explains the fluid
you saw coming out of his mouth.

481
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:56,235
The only cause for that
to happen in a dead body

482
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:59,298
is a bad chest cold
or an opioid addiction.

483
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:00,484
That's good to know.

484
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:02,978
We need to get a warrant
for Jeff's rehab records,

485
00:20:03,084 --> 00:20:04,892
see if he made any friends in there.

486
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:06,884
Actually, I spoke to an ex-girlfriend.

487
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:08,322
She told me while Jeff was in rehab,

488
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:10,057
he connected with a man who was, quote,

489
00:20:10,091 --> 00:20:12,049
"ass cancer in a skin suit."

490
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:13,760
Got Jeff to deal some drugs for him

491
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,195
while he was in his fancy prep school.

492
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:16,731
This skin suit have a name?

493
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:17,868
Bruno Winch.

494
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:19,229
He lives over in Highland Park.

495
00:20:25,426 --> 00:20:26,997
LAPD! Probation search!

496
00:20:27,034 --> 00:20:28,251
Open up!

497
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:33,213
- Bruno Winch! LAPD!
- Clear!

498
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,352
- Clear!
- Clear.

499
00:20:39,943 --> 00:20:41,115
Clear!

500
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:50,297
Clear.

501
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:56,300
Baseball bat. Tough way to go.

502
00:20:57,763 --> 00:20:59,706
White shoes, red triangles.

503
00:21:12,536 --> 00:21:13,669
I don't see you in 20 years,

504
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:14,880
now I see you twice in one day.

505
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:16,839
I still cannot believe you're a cop.

506
00:21:16,972 --> 00:21:18,091
How long have you been in L.A.?

507
00:21:18,128 --> 00:21:19,474
Uh, less than a year.

508
00:21:19,508 --> 00:21:20,868
Moved out after Sarah and I got divorced

509
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,507
and Henry went off to college.

510
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:23,945
That's right.

511
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:26,242
Yeah, Henry would be, um, 20 now.

512
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:27,579
20.

513
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,502
That's so weird. We're so old.

514
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,750
Right. And yet,
you look exactly the same.

515
00:21:31,787 --> 00:21:32,987
How is that even possible?

516
00:21:33,022 --> 00:21:35,790
Grace. Did Bruno make it?

517
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:37,926
He's critical, but I think he'll live.

518
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,173
- He's in ICU.
- Any chance for an interview?

519
00:21:40,273 --> 00:21:41,570
No, we had to induce a coma.

520
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:42,887
There's a lot of pressure on his brain.

521
00:21:42,924 --> 00:21:45,421
- Couple days, maybe?
- Most likely, it's gonna be a week.

522
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:47,281
But we bagged his clothing for you.

523
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,200
Excuse me.

524
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:53,902
Yeah, see, I didn't feel anything then.

525
00:21:53,976 --> 00:21:55,677
Yeah, maybe I'm just making it up.

526
00:21:55,757 --> 00:21:57,421
Now I think you're just
giving me a hard time.

527
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:58,480
Absolutely possible.

528
00:21:58,514 --> 00:22:00,460
So, what are we thinking with Bruno?

529
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,179
He and his partner

530
00:22:03,234 --> 00:22:04,986
pull a home invasion to get to Jeff.

531
00:22:05,117 --> 00:22:08,056
Jeff probably stole
something from him...

532
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,046
maybe owed him drugs, money.

533
00:22:10,336 --> 00:22:12,327
But then how does Bruno
end up beaten half to death?

534
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:13,761
Don't do that... speculate.

535
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,991
Making up stories is how
innocent men go to jail

536
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:17,260
and guilty men go free.

537
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,134
- Thus endeth the tip.
- Understood.

538
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,603
- Alright. End of shift.
- Uh, you riding back to the station?

539
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,197
Oh, no, I don't have
to clock out like you do.

540
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:26,109
I'm gonna stay here, have some
questionable hospital food,

541
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,406
see if a miracle happens
and Bruno wakes up.

542
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,288
Okay. Later.

543
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,725
Later.

544
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:40,265
Armstrong?

545
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:45,017
I'm doing a huge renovation
on a house I just bought.

546
00:22:45,054 --> 00:22:47,774
I could really use
an extra set of hands.

547
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:49,430
Pizza and beer on me.

548
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:55,548
Pizza <i>and</i> beer?

549
00:22:55,642 --> 00:22:57,955
- This place is a wreck.
- Yes.

550
00:22:58,095 --> 00:22:59,741
But it's <i>my</i> wreck.

551
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,710
So, hey, tell me about Grace.

552
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:05,146
Uh... we dated.

553
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,581
Yeah, I knew it.

554
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:08,937
She had that "bad breakup" energy.

555
00:23:08,974 --> 00:23:10,885
It was 20 years ago,

556
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,488
and she's wearing a ring,
probably has a kid.

557
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:14,889
I'm sure she barely remembers me.

558
00:23:14,924 --> 00:23:16,991
- Yeah, yeah.
- Just tell me what happened.

559
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:19,194
We met my junior year.

560
00:23:19,228 --> 00:23:22,564
I was... dating my ex-wife,
Sarah, since high school,

561
00:23:22,598 --> 00:23:25,200
and, uh, we hit a bad spell
and broke up.

562
00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:27,502
And that's when Grace happened.

563
00:23:27,536 --> 00:23:29,003
Yeah, we'd been friends
for a few months,

564
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:30,551
and there had always been a spark,

565
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:32,008
but it just...

566
00:23:32,957 --> 00:23:34,742
went off like a bomb.

567
00:23:34,988 --> 00:23:36,622
Crawled all over each other
for two weeks.

568
00:23:36,659 --> 00:23:39,741
It was zero to 160 in
the span of a heartbeat.

569
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:42,512
And then?

570
00:23:42,864 --> 00:23:45,473
Then Sarah showed up at my dorm
eight weeks' pregnant.

571
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,549
Damn. Damn.

572
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:49,879
And you did the right thing?

573
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,092
There was really no other choice.

574
00:23:51,126 --> 00:23:53,150
I still loved her, and that was my kid.

575
00:23:53,994 --> 00:23:56,030
So, I, uh, dropped out of school,

576
00:23:56,065 --> 00:23:58,611
packed up my things,
moved back to Foxburg.

577
00:23:58,648 --> 00:24:01,742
I was married in a month,
a dad within six,

578
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:04,075
got a job in construction,
never looked back.

579
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:05,446
Never?

580
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:08,138
Well... I mean, not <i>never.</i>

581
00:24:08,635 --> 00:24:11,285
Now your paths have crossed again, so...

582
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,487
So, nothing. I'm seeing someone,
and she's married.

583
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,856
Married women are the best.

584
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:18,086
You find yourself

585
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,954
a sexually frustrated, hot little mama

586
00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:21,432
whose husband isn't doing it right...

587
00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:22,490
I can't do that, I mean,

588
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,958
just thinking about
that stresses me out.

589
00:24:23,993 --> 00:24:26,561
That's... That's how lives are ruined.

590
00:24:29,432 --> 00:24:32,709
That... is the right answer.

591
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,415
Hey, you can't be faithful to a girl,

592
00:24:36,504 --> 00:24:39,065
you can't be faithful
to an oath or a badge.

593
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:41,090
- I'll drink to that.
- Yes.

594
00:24:41,677 --> 00:24:43,397
- Running late?
- Yeah, had to commute

595
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:44,829
from my folks' place in Simi Valley.

596
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:46,681
Half the LAPD lives in Ventura County,

597
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:48,532
but they all seem to
make it to work on time.

598
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:49,609
Yeah, well, my dad was getting all up

599
00:24:49,646 --> 00:24:51,165
in my business about getting extended.

600
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:53,561
Literally had to stop him from coming
down here and lighting up Lopez.

601
00:24:53,598 --> 00:24:55,963
Look, the hole you're in
has nothing to do with Lopez.

602
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,801
But she's gonna pay the price
when the commander's son

603
00:24:57,837 --> 00:24:59,608
goes belly-up halfway through training.

604
00:24:59,843 --> 00:25:00,995
I told him it's not her fault.

605
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,476
Yeah, so, tell him again.

606
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,599
Lopez bent over backwards for you.

607
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:06,320
She protected your ass
when any other T.O.

608
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:07,860
would've sent you packing.

609
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:10,399
You owe her your career.

610
00:25:11,888 --> 00:25:13,296
I know.

611
00:25:21,242 --> 00:25:22,463
Hey.

612
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,836
You're the cop who wrestled
the guy in the kilt.

613
00:25:24,873 --> 00:25:25,993
Yes. Actually, I'm here

614
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,985
checking on another patient.
Bruno Winch?

615
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:30,124
- We're trying to I.D. his p...
- Bruno's still in a coma.

616
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:32,160
Right. I figured... as much.

617
00:25:32,194 --> 00:25:33,963
I just thought I'd come and check.

618
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,879
You could have done that by phone.

619
00:25:37,628 --> 00:25:38,995
See ya.

620
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:42,524
I officially feel like
you're stalking me.

621
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:45,063
That is as ridiculous
as it is accurate.

622
00:25:45,207 --> 00:25:47,456
We really just didn't get a
chance to catch up yesterday.

623
00:25:47,493 --> 00:25:49,135
Like, how long have
you been working here?

624
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,700
And, uh, do you have any kids?

625
00:25:53,703 --> 00:25:55,249
I've been here three weeks,

626
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:57,711
I'm the new head of emergency medicine,

627
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,362
and I have an 8-year-old.

628
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:00,625
Oh, 8's such a great age,

629
00:26:00,662 --> 00:26:02,877
I mean, obviously,
they're all great, but 8 is...

630
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:04,321
John, listen...

631
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:06,716
I don't mean to be rude.

632
00:26:07,477 --> 00:26:08,896
I can't do this with you.

633
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,393
Grace, it's been 20 years.

634
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,078
You left a note on my door.

635
00:26:12,133 --> 00:26:13,985
I mean, I never heard from you again.

636
00:26:14,546 --> 00:26:15,913
Sarah was pregnant.

637
00:26:16,105 --> 00:26:17,739
You broke my heart.

638
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,907
I mean, I thought that
we were both in love,

639
00:26:19,942 --> 00:26:22,043
and then you just disappeared.

640
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:25,496
I can't believe that I am still

641
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:26,609
this angry with you.

642
00:26:26,646 --> 00:26:28,127
- Grace...
- You know, I'll have them call you

643
00:26:28,163 --> 00:26:29,599
when your suspect wakes up.

644
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:46,400
Mr. Christian?

645
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:47,506
Can I help you with something?

646
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,955
Uh, Detective Armstrong
asked me to come in

647
00:26:49,992 --> 00:26:52,341
so he could re-interview me after,

648
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:54,418
you know, the initial shock's passed.

649
00:26:55,882 --> 00:26:57,666
But I'm not sure it has.

650
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:03,012
I can only imagine what you're
going through right now.

651
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:06,723
Hell, if somebody hurt my Henry,
I'd be out for blood.

652
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:14,879
I'll go let Detective Armstrong
know that you're here.

653
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:20,572
- Armstrong.
- Yeah. What's up, buddy?

654
00:27:20,607 --> 00:27:21,707
I was just talking

655
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:22,960
to Matt Christian in the lobby.

656
00:27:22,997 --> 00:27:24,317
- Mm-hmm?
- I told him,

657
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:26,187
if anything happened to my son,
I'd be out for blood,

658
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:28,850
and he just got this look.

659
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:32,139
I mean, I-I could be
misinterpreting it.

660
00:27:32,176 --> 00:27:34,911
Our job as investigators
is not to speculate.

661
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:36,418
It's to think about what we've seen,

662
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:37,618
what we've heard,

663
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,726
and articulate the facts.

664
00:27:40,107 --> 00:27:41,807
What are those facts?

665
00:27:42,756 --> 00:27:44,724
Matt paid for Jeff to go to rehab.

666
00:27:44,921 --> 00:27:47,860
Uh, that's where Jeff met Bruno.

667
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:49,260
Yep.

668
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:51,133
It's definitely possible

669
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,135
that Matt met Bruno there

670
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,473
when he was visiting his son.

671
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:57,576
Maybe Matt recognized Bruno's voice

672
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,177
during the home invasion?

673
00:28:00,647 --> 00:28:02,000
Let's go talk to Matt.

674
00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:04,283
Alright. Thanks for coming by, Matt.

675
00:28:04,317 --> 00:28:06,521
- How's Marilyn today?
- We didn't sleep.

676
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:09,252
She, uh... She can't stop crying.

677
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:12,445
Yeah, I'm sorry.

678
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,082
I only have a few follow-up questions,

679
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,755
and then we'll get you
back to her, okay?

680
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:16,895
- Yeah.
- Alright,

681
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,628
Was Jeff on pain medication?

682
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:20,273
We found oxy in his room.

683
00:28:21,362 --> 00:28:23,479
He tore his knee last year.

684
00:28:23,665 --> 00:28:25,274
Eh... Doctor gave him
a couple of pills.

685
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:26,540
He was hooked for a little while,

686
00:28:26,577 --> 00:28:28,870
but... I got him clean.

687
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,676
- Re-birth Malibu.
- That's right.

688
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,253
They straightened him right out.

689
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:34,313
- Did you ever visit him there?
- Of course.

690
00:28:34,347 --> 00:28:35,531
You know, when they let me.

691
00:28:35,568 --> 00:28:38,330
Did you meet a patient
named Bruno Winch?

692
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:43,655
Doesn't ring a bell.

693
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,945
But what's this got to do
with the home invasion?

694
00:28:47,982 --> 00:28:50,162
That... wasn't about Jeff.

695
00:28:50,258 --> 00:28:53,655
Well... actually, we think
he was the real target.

696
00:28:55,911 --> 00:28:57,782
What are you talking about?

697
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,185
Bruno Winch is one of the men
that entered your home,

698
00:29:00,222 --> 00:29:02,645
bound and beat you,
and killed your son.

699
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,090
I have a photo of him.
Maybe you recognize him.

700
00:29:08,335 --> 00:29:10,710
- Oops.
- Uh, that's the wrong photo.

701
00:29:10,747 --> 00:29:13,116
That's what he looked like
yesterday when we found him, so...

702
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:14,519
- Is he dead?
- No.

703
00:29:14,554 --> 00:29:15,721
He's just in the hospital.

704
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:16,961
We're waiting for him to wake up

705
00:29:16,998 --> 00:29:18,520
so he can tell us who did that to him.

706
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,977
I don't actually
have the photo with me.

707
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:21,811
Uh... let me go get it.

708
00:29:22,937 --> 00:29:24,629
Uh, Matt, why didn't you mention

709
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:26,898
that Jeff had a drug problem?

710
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:31,569
Wasn't a problem anymore.

711
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,506
And I didn't want his
whole memory to be that.

712
00:29:34,703 --> 00:29:37,248
- Of course.
- Well, that's a father's job...

713
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,617
protect his kids.

714
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,195
He was the best part of me.

715
00:29:41,719 --> 00:29:43,253
I failed him.

716
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:46,643
Matt, I know you feel guilty.

717
00:29:46,686 --> 00:29:48,281
Put him in rehab to straighten him out,

718
00:29:48,318 --> 00:29:49,726
watch him get connected with bad people

719
00:29:49,763 --> 00:29:51,354
who just pulled him deeper down,

720
00:29:51,391 --> 00:29:52,724
but that is not your fault.

721
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,245
If you know anything

722
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:56,661
that can lead us to Bruno's partner,

723
00:29:56,749 --> 00:29:58,355
you need to tell me.

724
00:29:59,406 --> 00:30:00,808
Just let us do our job.

725
00:30:10,718 --> 00:30:12,577
Sorry. Printer's broken.

726
00:30:12,614 --> 00:30:14,532
Uh, I can e-mail you the photo.

727
00:30:14,624 --> 00:30:16,047
Sure.

728
00:30:16,345 --> 00:30:20,272
Uh... I really have
to get back to my wife.

729
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:22,393
O-Of course. Of... Of course. Come...

730
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:25,198
Uh, we'll be in touch. Soon.

731
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,858
Thank you.

732
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:33,125
- So, what do you think?
- He's out for revenge.

733
00:30:33,162 --> 00:30:34,596
We get a surveillance team on him?

734
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:35,734
If he knows who Bruno is,

735
00:30:35,768 --> 00:30:37,432
it's likely he knows
who Bruno's partner is,

736
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:38,524
and he'll go after him next.

737
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:39,771
Which is why when I stepped out,

738
00:30:39,806 --> 00:30:42,112
I had SIS put a tracker on Matt's car.

739
00:30:42,243 --> 00:30:43,510
Airship will follow.

740
00:30:43,547 --> 00:30:44,976
While we hunt down the partner.

741
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,745
While we hunt down the partner.

742
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,379
- You doing okay?
- Fine.

743
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:51,049
I know what's bothering you.

744
00:30:51,336 --> 00:30:52,551
Seven Year Glitch.

745
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:54,319
- Sorry. Seven Year what?
- Glitch.

746
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,921
The most dangerous time for a cop

747
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:58,790
happens every seven years,
like clockwork.

748
00:30:58,825 --> 00:31:00,559
It's when most of us lose the passion,

749
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:02,327
grow complacent, disillusioned.

750
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,808
I went through it myself.

751
00:31:03,845 --> 00:31:05,313
Okay, well... I mean,

752
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,965
I've only been on for six months.

753
00:31:07,249 --> 00:31:09,136
You're not a regular rookie.

754
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:11,159
You've been gung-ho
since you were a kid.

755
00:31:11,196 --> 00:31:12,974
And now you're glitching early.

756
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:17,809
Okay, well, h-how do I fix my glitch?

757
00:31:17,844 --> 00:31:19,306
How'd you fix yours?

758
00:31:19,784 --> 00:31:21,520
I became a T.O.

759
00:31:21,557 --> 00:31:23,964
Changed my routine. Challenged myself.

760
00:31:24,003 --> 00:31:25,851
Well, I am challenging myself.

761
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,819
Me not being all in, all the time,

762
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:29,721
is me changing my routine.

763
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:34,144
But... you know, I can...

764
00:31:34,181 --> 00:31:36,887
I can put all that on hold
for six more months,

765
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,263
embrace my inner slacker
after you're free of me.

766
00:31:39,532 --> 00:31:41,892
- I'm not asking you that...
- I know.

767
00:31:41,996 --> 00:31:43,563
But it's the right thing.

768
00:31:44,871 --> 00:31:46,755
Do you want me to read to you?

769
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,500
- No.
- Come on.

770
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,809
- You have to learn it.
- I can do that on my own.

771
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,841
- What are we doing back here?
- I checked the computer.

772
00:31:57,877 --> 00:31:59,277
Rex didn't bring in
his bounty last night,

773
00:31:59,314 --> 00:32:00,874
which means he's been
out here this whole time.

774
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,304
So this is a welfare check?

775
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:03,735
Oh, don't put it to him like that.

776
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:11,864
7-Adam-19,

777
00:32:11,901 --> 00:32:13,765
got a broken car window,
missing driver.

778
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,279
Send backup to my location.

779
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:24,058
Rex.

780
00:32:24,783 --> 00:32:26,142
Eh, that little punk

781
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:27,900
- hit me with a cheap shot.
- 7-Adam-19, we need

782
00:32:27,936 --> 00:32:29,414
an RA to 1966 Keegan.

783
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,587
Assault victim. Broken arm,

784
00:32:30,624 --> 00:32:32,017
- possible concussion.
- Where'd he go?

785
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,401
- His aunt's house.
- He's long gone by now, though.

786
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:37,377
We need a warrant, or backup.

787
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:38,888
- Sit down.
- No, go...

788
00:32:38,925 --> 00:32:41,194
Go, go! Go with him. I'm fine. Go!

789
00:32:42,032 --> 00:32:44,618
Tony Craig! That's Bruno's partner.

790
00:32:45,835 --> 00:32:47,220
He's all over Bruno's cellphone.

791
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,142
They even texted about
the home invasion.

792
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:50,613
Apartment's in Century City.

793
00:32:51,311 --> 00:32:52,923
Matt Christian's in the wind.

794
00:32:53,665 --> 00:32:55,299
I thought there was a tracker
on his car.

795
00:32:55,357 --> 00:32:57,092
He ditched it at the mall. Disappeared.

796
00:32:57,129 --> 00:32:59,094
- Which mall?
- Century City.

797
00:33:00,053 --> 00:33:01,721
He's going after Tony.

798
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:05,493
Whoa, Nico, where is he?

799
00:33:05,563 --> 00:33:06,758
He, I don't know.

800
00:33:06,803 --> 00:33:08,698
- He isn't here.
- There's blood on your front door.

801
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:09,813
That's exigent circumstances,

802
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:11,370
so I'm not leaving till
you tell me where he is.

803
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,385
He isn't here!

804
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:13,703
So, you're gonna call him.

805
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:15,171
Otherwise we're gonna book you

806
00:33:15,206 --> 00:33:16,580
for aiding and abetting a fugitive.

807
00:33:16,617 --> 00:33:17,674
Do it now.

808
00:33:27,141 --> 00:33:28,820
Hey. What's up?

809
00:33:28,886 --> 00:33:30,739
Cops are here. Where are you?

810
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:32,310
I'm in Florida.

811
00:33:33,682 --> 00:33:34,858
Nico Sandoval!

812
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,752
You got five seconds to surrender!

813
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,867
I'm in Florida, yo.

814
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:48,872
You guys want some of this?

815
00:34:19,707 --> 00:34:21,905
Michelle! Bail me out, okay?

816
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:23,139
You're coming, too. Let's go.

817
00:34:23,176 --> 00:34:25,027
- What?!
- Right now.

818
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:30,246
Tony's gate is open.

819
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:42,774
Clear.

820
00:34:56,566 --> 00:34:58,000
Clear.

821
00:35:02,461 --> 00:35:03,880
Matt got here before us.

822
00:35:03,914 --> 00:35:05,554
He must have knew
we were right behind him,

823
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,724
took Tony someplace to finish him off.

824
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:09,760
Yeah. But where?

825
00:35:09,797 --> 00:35:10,820
Mrs. Christian,

826
00:35:10,855 --> 00:35:12,550
I know you think you're protecting him,

827
00:35:12,587 --> 00:35:15,022
but what your husband
is doing is wrong.

828
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:19,003
Look, m-ma'am,

829
00:35:19,163 --> 00:35:21,453
right now, you can't see
beyond this moment.

830
00:35:21,871 --> 00:35:23,338
Neither can your husband.

831
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:24,968
Making those men pay for what they did

832
00:35:25,002 --> 00:35:26,436
is all he cares about.

833
00:35:27,827 --> 00:35:29,395
I, uh...

834
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:33,629
I know just... a little
about what it's like

835
00:35:33,666 --> 00:35:36,495
to be obsessed with something

836
00:35:36,532 --> 00:35:38,314
at the expense of everything else.

837
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:42,666
And trust me, it will not
change the way you feel.

838
00:35:45,356 --> 00:35:46,815
Look, your son is gone,

839
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:49,905
and what your husband is doing
will destroy both of you.

840
00:35:50,194 --> 00:35:51,495
I know it's too late to save Jeff,

841
00:35:51,532 --> 00:35:53,967
but if you can tell us where Matt is...

842
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,104
...you might not lose your husband.

843
00:36:14,026 --> 00:36:15,559
Matt!

844
00:36:16,969 --> 00:36:18,249
What did you do with Tony?

845
00:36:18,403 --> 00:36:19,646
What he deserved.

846
00:36:20,908 --> 00:36:22,367
And now it's over...

847
00:36:22,927 --> 00:36:24,127
or it's gonna be soon.

848
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,196
The cement.

849
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,224
Matt put Tony in the cement.

850
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:40,603
That criminal killed my boy.

851
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:43,179
I know, and he's gonna pay, okay?

852
00:36:43,214 --> 00:36:44,438
So, you don't have to do this.

853
00:36:44,475 --> 00:36:45,915
You can just come on down.

854
00:36:52,867 --> 00:36:54,365
You don't get it.

855
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,131
I died in that bedroom
alongside my son.

856
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:02,743
The only thing keeping me alive
was killing them.

857
00:37:03,727 --> 00:37:05,362
And now that's over.

858
00:37:07,869 --> 00:37:09,403
Hey, Nolan!

859
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:11,674
Look, I found him,
but I can't get him up.

860
00:37:11,709 --> 00:37:13,076
Help me!

861
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,038
We can only save one guy,

862
00:37:15,112 --> 00:37:18,455
and right now, Tony is the victim!

863
00:37:21,596 --> 00:37:24,020
Matt, I know this seems
hopeless right now,

864
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:26,189
but don't make your wife
bury two bodies.

865
00:37:26,223 --> 00:37:27,423
It will destroy her.

866
00:37:28,061 --> 00:37:30,063
Nolan! Help me!

867
00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:44,332
Come here.

868
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:46,109
Come on!

869
00:37:52,597 --> 00:37:54,157
Watch yourself.

870
00:37:58,355 --> 00:38:00,130
ABCs. Go.

871
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,294
There we go.

872
00:38:04,328 --> 00:38:06,763
We saved him.

873
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:24,533
Training for the rematch with Nico?

874
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:28,059
Ah, we got him in the end.

875
00:38:29,629 --> 00:38:31,496
Here.

876
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:34,814
- What's this?
- It is...

877
00:38:34,851 --> 00:38:36,089
"Split Second Leadership:"

878
00:38:36,126 --> 00:38:37,536
"Leading Men In The Line of Duty,"

879
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:39,004
the audio book.

880
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,006
This book's out of print.

881
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:42,407
There's no audio book.

882
00:38:42,441 --> 00:38:44,757
Yeah, which is why
I recorded one for you.

883
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,095
Uh, listen,

884
00:38:46,132 --> 00:38:48,136
I-I talked to Isabel,
and from what she said,

885
00:38:48,173 --> 00:38:49,614
it's clear you're
a kinesthetic learner,

886
00:38:49,649 --> 00:38:51,199
which just means that
you need to listen

887
00:38:51,236 --> 00:38:53,712
while you're being active
in order to absorb things.

888
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,725
There's no shame in it. Really.

889
00:38:57,123 --> 00:39:00,754
Honestly, it's probably why
you excel at being a cop.

890
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:05,430
Uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

891
00:39:05,464 --> 00:39:06,565
Yeah.

892
00:39:11,043 --> 00:39:12,107
Thanks.

893
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,714
<i>"Split Second Leadership"
by Curtis Philbrick,</i>

894
00:39:22,748 --> 00:39:24,783
<i>read by the best rookie
you've ever trained.</i>

895
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:32,090
- Hey, headed home?
- Yeah.

896
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:33,592
You live alone, right?

897
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:35,660
Yeah. First time ever. No roommates.

898
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:37,488
It's heaven. Why?

899
00:39:56,282 --> 00:39:57,582
Well, welcome aboard.

900
00:39:57,692 --> 00:39:59,618
Women's softball's on ESPN,

901
00:39:59,652 --> 00:40:01,468
and I just made a pitcher of mojitos.

902
00:40:01,505 --> 00:40:02,921
Come on in.

903
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:09,997
Yeah, nice!

904
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:13,883
Nope.

905
00:40:21,006 --> 00:40:22,540
Hey.

906
00:40:22,575 --> 00:40:25,384
I talked to Lopez, and she said
you needed a place to live

907
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:28,647
and a kickass roommate
to help you find some balance.

908
00:40:29,482 --> 00:40:31,049
Thank God. Thank you.

909
00:40:32,184 --> 00:40:35,458
Aww. Yeah. Come on.

910
00:40:35,495 --> 00:40:36,874
Come on. Let's go.
Let's get out of here.

911
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:40,825
Hey.

912
00:40:42,862 --> 00:40:44,863
Good Lord, don't you have
someplace better to be?

913
00:40:45,128 --> 00:40:46,631
It's nice to see you, too.

914
00:40:46,666 --> 00:40:49,334
Hey... thanks.

915
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:52,850
Look, I put the paperwork
through under your name.

916
00:40:53,472 --> 00:40:54,906
So, you're gonna get
the bounty on Nico.

917
00:40:55,701 --> 00:40:56,808
Thank you.

918
00:40:58,744 --> 00:41:01,079
Look, Rex,

919
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,324
I... I know you're not the
kind of guy that asks for help,

920
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:05,764
but if you ever find yourself
out here again,

921
00:41:06,138 --> 00:41:07,575
just give me a heads up.

922
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,938
Little professional courtesy, right?

923
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:11,556
Exactly. Alright.

924
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:13,892
Thanks, brother. Alright.
You take care.

925
00:41:21,921 --> 00:41:22,988
Hey.

926
00:41:23,073 --> 00:41:24,307
It's been a long day, John.

927
00:41:24,344 --> 00:41:25,664
No, I know. Of course.

928
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:27,594
And I'll only take
a moment of your time.

929
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:29,857
Look, I left you a note

930
00:41:30,142 --> 00:41:32,077
because I wouldn't have been
able to go through with it

931
00:41:32,111 --> 00:41:33,260
if I saw you in person.

932
00:41:35,016 --> 00:41:37,523
And I don't regret marrying Sarah,

933
00:41:38,173 --> 00:41:40,674
and I have loved every minute
of being Henry's dad.

934
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:43,749
But what I did to you was selfish,

935
00:41:43,786 --> 00:41:45,394
and you deserve better, and I'm sorry.

936
00:41:56,845 --> 00:41:57,900
Thank you.

937
00:42:00,095 --> 00:42:01,306
Thank <i>you.</i>

938
00:42:04,547 --> 00:42:07,822
So... now that we're friends again,

939
00:42:07,867 --> 00:42:09,034
it hurts when I do this.

940
00:42:11,851 --> 00:42:13,251
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Grace.
