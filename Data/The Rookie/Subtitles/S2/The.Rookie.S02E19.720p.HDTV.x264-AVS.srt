1
00:00:06,858 --> 00:00:09,583
Swear to God, now
he has this woman tied up,

2
00:00:09,585 --> 00:00:11,251
his own aunt.

3
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:13,153
He has a shotgun rigged
with duct tape and a string

4
00:00:13,155 --> 00:00:14,621
so he can shoot her from the fireplace.

5
00:00:14,623 --> 00:00:17,658
Yeah, while Chen's across town
going toe-to-toe with the 5-4.

6
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,459
Yeah, thirty gang members
against me and my T.O.

7
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:20,922
Oh, my God, that's hardcore.

8
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:21,956
How the hell'd you get out of that?

9
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:25,018
No joke, my T.O. goes,
"When you're in the LAPD"...

10
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,486
"You're never alone".

11
00:00:26,488 --> 00:00:27,660
And right on cue,

12
00:00:27,662 --> 00:00:29,489
an airship arrives with a SWAT team.

13
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:30,757
Damn, there's me thinking

14
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:32,892
discharging my weapon
this year was a big deal.

15
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:34,527
Aw, don't beat yourself up, Chris.

16
00:00:34,529 --> 00:00:35,895
I'm sure someday you'll catch up.

17
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:38,678
Oh, it's like that?

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,066
Oh, yeah. It's like that.

19
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:42,135
Come on, you guys. We're
not in the Academy anymore.

20
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:44,191
We don't have to be
competitive about everything.

21
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:46,608
Well, it's not a competition
when I always win.

22
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,752
Ooh, that's a deep cut!
But he does have a point.

23
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:49,776
- That's it, West.
- Hmm?

24
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:51,211
You and me, right now...

25
00:00:51,213 --> 00:00:52,979
We're gonna settle this
thing once and for all.

26
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:54,147
Mm.

27
00:00:56,952 --> 00:00:58,218
Drink up. Drink up.

28
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:02,082
I can't believe they still
can't let go of their rivalry.

29
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:04,608
Can't you? They were first
and second at the Academy.

30
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,959
Their dads were first and second.

31
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:07,760
- Oh! Sorry! Sorry!
- Oh, ho, ho!

32
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:08,929
- You okay?
- Yep.

33
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:10,997
Nope.

34
00:01:10,999 --> 00:01:13,666
I was just gonna get some
air. How about you join me?

35
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:16,970
- Sorry.
- No, no, no. Don't.

36
00:01:20,242 --> 00:01:22,575
So, I'm actually fine.

37
00:01:22,577 --> 00:01:24,978
Just... a little worried about Chris.

38
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,480
I mean, you always gave the
best advice at the Academy.

39
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:29,333
Thank you. Uh, what's going on?

40
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:31,710
At first, I thought it was
just a rocky transition.

41
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:34,002
You know, going from
being top of the class

42
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:35,160
to being just another Boot.

43
00:01:35,162 --> 00:01:38,258
But... he never really evened out.

44
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,693
Did you know he barely
passed our six-month exam?

45
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:42,629
- Can you believe that?
- Actually, I can.

46
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:44,597
If he came in expecting it to be easy,

47
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,832
I mean, it is not.

48
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:48,301
I'm worried. What if he's
really not ready?

49
00:01:48,303 --> 00:01:49,602
Should I say something?

50
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:51,605
I can't answer that for you.

51
00:01:52,936 --> 00:01:56,338
I can tell you that this year has
been tough for all of us.

52
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,673
I mean, no vacation, no sick days,

53
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:00,308
constantly under a microscope.

54
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,810
We've all stumbled.

55
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:03,645
Yeah.

56
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:05,814
If I were you, I would just...

57
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:07,682
tell Chris you're there for him.

58
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:10,018
And if he can bear down
for one more month,

59
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,486
then he can take some time off

60
00:02:11,488 --> 00:02:13,655
and just clear his head,
you know, reset.

61
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:16,825
I've been trying to convince
him to go on the road with me,

62
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:19,961
take an RV and camp, hike,

63
00:02:19,963 --> 00:02:22,130
just disconnect from all the noise

64
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:23,498
before we come back as P2s.

65
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,700
See, that would be perfect.

66
00:02:25,669 --> 00:02:27,435
Yeah.

67
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:28,837
Thanks.

68
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:31,039
I knew I'd feel better talking to you.

69
00:02:31,041 --> 00:02:32,607
50 bucks.

70
00:02:32,609 --> 00:02:34,076
Nolan! I need your help.

71
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:36,511
I'm sorry. How is this helping?

72
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:38,980
- Jackson and I are tied.
- One more event will settle this.

73
00:02:38,982 --> 00:02:40,615
If you hit Nolan, you lose.

74
00:02:40,617 --> 00:02:41,850
Wait, what game is this?

75
00:02:41,852 --> 00:02:43,151
- Suicide darts.
- Suicide darts.

76
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:44,519
Ow!

77
00:02:49,726 --> 00:02:52,060
I do not wanna go to work today.

78
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:54,689
Mm, you can be a few minutes late.

79
00:02:57,467 --> 00:03:00,735
Yeah, and do push-ups
in between every call

80
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:02,377
and jog behind the shop?

81
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,535
No, thanks.

82
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:04,706
Mm.

83
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,215
- Oh, come on!
- Mnh-mnh!

84
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:07,339
Bradford's chill.

85
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:09,711
I mean, maybe if you're
playing pick-up with him,

86
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:12,013
but not when he's your T.O.

87
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:14,516
He once designed an IED

88
00:03:14,518 --> 00:03:16,818
to blow up baby powder in my face

89
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,886
just to make a point.

90
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,487
Is he allowed to do that?

91
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,038
I just need to get through
the next thirty days,

92
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,590
and then I will be free.

93
00:03:22,592 --> 00:03:24,926
No more mind games. No more Tim Tests.

94
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:26,828
No more chewing me out in public.

95
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,998
Okay, so you're saying thirty days,

96
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,167
and then I can make you late?

97
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,602
- Mm.
- Hm?

98
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,171
Mm.

99
00:03:36,173 --> 00:03:37,906
Um... listen.

100
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:40,208
If we bump into each other at work,

101
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,578
can we please just play it cool?

102
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,879
I'm not cool?

103
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:46,514
No! You know what I mean!

104
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:49,507
Like, on the... D.L.

105
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:50,585
The D.L.?

106
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:52,347
Yep, I said that. I'm sorry.

107
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:54,789
Don't laugh!

108
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,139
Don't you work with your roommate?

109
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,526
Oh, Jackson's got my back.
He would never talk.

110
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:02,097
Well, I can't promise I'll be
able to keep my eyes off of you,

111
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,966
but otherwise, deal.

112
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:06,491
- Thank you.
- Mm.

113
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:07,949
Aah!

114
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:09,604
But, wait, Grace might actually

115
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:11,072
let her ex-husband come back home?

116
00:04:11,074 --> 00:04:12,640
For the sake of her son.

117
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:14,542
Look, I-I get where she's coming from.

118
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:16,444
I mean, I did something
similar with my ex.

119
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:17,545
Staying together for the kid,

120
00:04:17,547 --> 00:04:19,781
even when you knew
the relationship was doomed.

121
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:22,050
Did that actually make
things better for Henry?

122
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:23,718
No. But what am I gonna do?

123
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,415
Mansplain to her she's making a mistake?

124
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:26,544
How well is that gonna go over?

125
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:27,622
Yeah, not well.

126
00:04:27,624 --> 00:04:29,557
But if you leave her alone,

127
00:04:29,559 --> 00:04:30,968
you risk giving the ex an opening.

128
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,058
Tough one.

129
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,482
I'm looking for some sage advice here.

130
00:04:33,484 --> 00:04:36,153
If you haven't noticed, my
personal life's a dumpster fire.

131
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:39,968
All I can say is...

132
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,504
I'm rooting for you two.

133
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:44,272
Good luck, buddy.

134
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:45,740
You can do it.

135
00:04:45,742 --> 00:04:46,975
I'm telling you.

136
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:50,678
Today is our rookies' one-year
mark in the F.T.O. program.

137
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,981
Congratulations on not washing out.

138
00:04:55,052 --> 00:04:56,151
Yet.

139
00:04:56,153 --> 00:04:57,252
We'll see.

140
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:58,409
There's still time.

141
00:04:58,411 --> 00:05:01,656
That also means today is the start

142
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:02,991
of your Thirty Day Push.

143
00:05:03,756 --> 00:05:05,236
Why is that important, Officer Nolan?

144
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:08,129
Because in one month,

145
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:10,298
we will no longer be
probationary employees,

146
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,602
but fully fledged patrol
officers of the LAPD?

147
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:16,004
- No.
- Damn it.

148
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:18,480
Because, as your T.O.s have pointed out,

149
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:20,141
you are not there yet.

150
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:22,544
The end of the race
is always the hardest.

151
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:25,280
The Push is to remind
you not to celebrate

152
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,848
until you cross the finish line.

153
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,949
Understand?

154
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:29,017
Yes, sir.

155
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:30,118
Good.

156
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,720
And... that's all I got.

157
00:05:32,722 --> 00:05:34,956
For the first time in history,

158
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,824
the night shift did their jobs...

159
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:39,961
left no open cases
that require follow-up.

160
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:42,630
So, go on, find some crime.

161
00:05:42,632 --> 00:05:43,865
And be safe out there.

162
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,304
It's weird we haven't had any calls yet.

163
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:51,139
Crime doesn't run on a schedule, Boot.

164
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:55,343
What are you so happy about?

165
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:57,312
What? Nothing.

166
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:58,646
Can't I smile?

167
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:00,215
You've just been doing it a lot lately.

168
00:06:00,217 --> 00:06:02,560
I didn't realize happiness
was an impediment

169
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,651
to being a good cop.

170
00:06:03,653 --> 00:06:04,819
I'm just surprised you haven't tried

171
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,888
to talk my ear off about whatever it is.

172
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,124
So, what? Did you rescue a kitten?

173
00:06:09,126 --> 00:06:10,158
Adopt a star?

174
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,661
My personal life is
none of your business.

175
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:15,563
Finally. There's hope for you yet.

176
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:18,746
My mom is driving me crazy.

177
00:06:18,748 --> 00:06:20,335
She's teamed up with Wesley's mom,

178
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:21,936
so every time I try to make a decision

179
00:06:21,938 --> 00:06:23,204
about the wedding, I'm outnumbered.

180
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:25,073
You're the bride.
Shouldn't you get final say?

181
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:26,741
I'm the only girl in either family,

182
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:28,209
so they're living vicariously.

183
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:29,911
And I don't have the
bandwidth to push back

184
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:32,080
because I'm so focused
on making detective.

185
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:33,881
If I don't make the next
round of promotions,

186
00:06:33,883 --> 00:06:36,784
I'll have to take the
detective's exam again.

187
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:38,086
But while I'm distracted,

188
00:06:38,088 --> 00:06:39,921
those viejas are hijacking my wedding.

189
00:06:39,923 --> 00:06:41,789
Come on. I'm pretty
sure it's not that bad.

190
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:45,316
They decided the color scheme
should be pink and peach.

191
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:46,394
Oh, no.

192
00:06:46,396 --> 00:06:48,763
Do I look like a woman
who's ever worn peach?

193
00:06:48,765 --> 00:06:50,898
No. You're definitely an autumn.

194
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:58,106
Is that... ?

195
00:06:58,108 --> 00:06:59,707
No.

196
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:00,976
No.

197
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,912
Wait a second.

198
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:06,281
No. Forget it.

199
00:07:06,283 --> 00:07:08,383
Okay, so, how about you
make visual confirmation

200
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:09,951
before you speak?

201
00:07:09,953 --> 00:07:11,153
Roger that.

202
00:07:12,656 --> 00:07:14,289
You a little nervous about court today?

203
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:15,323
My lawyer says,

204
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:17,825
with all of my positive
changes that I've made

205
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:20,828
and my improved relationship
with Donovan, there's no reason

206
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,730
the judge shouldn't
grant me shared custody.

207
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:23,765
That's great!

208
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:25,800
Yeah, except the judge
is a real hard-ass

209
00:07:25,802 --> 00:07:29,404
and has a reputation for being
unorthodox in his rulings.

210
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:32,741
I'm sure you have
nothing to worry about.

211
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:38,279
Man! I don't know that I've
ever had a shift this quiet.

212
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:44,575
Did you really just say
the "Q" word in my shop?

213
00:07:44,577 --> 00:07:45,820
What? Quie...

214
00:07:45,822 --> 00:07:47,755
Na-na-ah-ah-ah-ah! Stop!

215
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:50,158
You do not, under any circumstance,

216
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,760
ever use the "Q" word while on duty.

217
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:54,829
That is like saying "Macbeth" in theater

218
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:56,998
or talking about a
no-hitter in the dugout.

219
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,434
O... kay. I had no idea
you were superstitious.

220
00:07:59,436 --> 00:08:01,526
That is not superstition. That's fact.

221
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,071
Where are you going?

222
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:05,006
I am going to get the
trauma plate for my vest,

223
00:08:05,008 --> 00:08:06,874
'cause I have a feeling
I'm gonna need it.

224
00:08:06,876 --> 00:08:09,811
You and your big mouth probably
just cost me custody of my kid.

225
00:08:15,652 --> 00:08:17,385
Wilshire units, information only.

226
00:08:17,387 --> 00:08:20,495
Hollywood division is in pursuit
after a shots fired call.

227
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:22,786
Event 8-0-5 working on channel 4.

228
00:08:22,788 --> 00:08:24,025
Information only.

229
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:25,393
Turn that on. I wanna hear.

230
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:28,129
Uh, gr-gray Maserati, no plates.

231
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,964
Suspect vehicle is picking up speed.

232
00:08:29,966 --> 00:08:32,867
Uh, we are southbound on
Normandie, 50 miles an hour.

233
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:34,168
We got moderate traffic.

234
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:35,870
Wait. That voice.

235
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:36,971
That's Chris.

236
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:37,973
Rios.

237
00:08:38,975 --> 00:08:40,475
We went to the Academy together.

238
00:08:40,477 --> 00:08:42,667
His dad worked Narcotics with
my old man back in the day.

239
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,912
Well, at least Hollywood's
getting a little action today.

240
00:08:44,914 --> 00:08:47,215
O-O-O-Okay, wait.
I'm... J-Just stand by.

241
00:08:47,217 --> 00:08:48,349
Something's going down.

242
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:49,817
Okay, he's left on Wilshire.

243
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:51,686
E-Eastbound on Wilshire. Speed is 70.

244
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:53,921
This is heavy traffic. He's...
He's blowing lights.

245
00:08:53,923 --> 00:08:55,890
- Sidewalk! He's on the sidewalk!
- He's too amped up.

246
00:08:55,892 --> 00:08:57,058
Copy, eastbound Wilshire,

247
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,326
speed 70, blowing lights call.

248
00:08:58,328 --> 00:08:59,894
6-Mary-100, copy?

249
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:01,396
Copy. Advise Mid-Wilshire.

250
00:09:01,398 --> 00:09:03,731
Want is 245 with a handgun.

251
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,067
Control, 7-Adam-15,
attach us to the pursuit.

252
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:08,403
Event 8-0-5 and switching to channel 4.

253
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:10,405
"Quiet", he says.

254
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:13,574
6-Adam-41, just T.C.'d,
Wilshire at Virgil.

255
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:15,943
We are lead car. I-I'm
gonna need backup, guys.

256
00:09:15,945 --> 00:09:17,245
I need... I-I need help!

257
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:18,946
Copy, 6-Mary-47 help call.

258
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,948
Hollywood and Mid-Wilshire
units responding.

259
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,551
Control, 7-Adam-19, attach. Code 3.

260
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:28,690
Copy, 6-Mary-47 eastbound on Wilshire,

261
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:29,790
approaching MacArthur Park.

262
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,032
That's right around the corner.

263
00:09:31,895 --> 00:09:34,228
Control, 7-Adam-07,
we're two blocks from there.

264
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,897
Suspect vehicle has crashed!

265
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:44,459
- Hey, get back! Get back!
- Hands! Hands!

266
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,574
Show me your hands! Hands on the window!

267
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,109
- Chris, get back!
- Hands! Hands!

268
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:49,711
- Show me your hands!
- No! No!

269
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,280
No! Chris!

270
00:09:52,282 --> 00:09:53,881
Son of a bitch!

271
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:55,184
Rios!

272
00:10:05,962 --> 00:10:08,129
Control, 7-15, we have the Maserati,

273
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:09,263
northbound Park View.

274
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,233
In pursuit. Speed's 60. Occupied once.

275
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,699
7-Adam-07, shots fired.

276
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,437
Officer down. Repeat, officer down.

277
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:18,304
Requesting R.A. for a 25-year-old male,

278
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:19,373
gunshot wound to the chest.

279
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:20,842
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Conscious and breathing.

280
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:22,244
Park View at 7th.

281
00:10:24,726 --> 00:10:27,521
All units, be advised,
7-Adam-15 in pursuit

282
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:29,489
of gray Maserati heading
south on Alvarado.

283
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:31,781
- Do you see him?
- Negative. I lost him at the last intersection.

284
00:10:31,783 --> 00:10:32,826
Damn it.

285
00:10:32,828 --> 00:10:33,950
Attention, all units.

286
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:36,212
Air-12 spotted a gray Maserati
matching suspect's vehicle

287
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:38,514
entering covered parking
structure at 6th and Grand.

288
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:40,316
7-Adam-15 responding. Code 3.

289
00:10:45,505 --> 00:10:46,738
Just keep breathing, buddy, alright?

290
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,043
- Martinez.
- Alright. Huh?

291
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:50,251
Sarge is gonna want to talk
to you. You're a witness.

292
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:51,876
- I'm not leaving this kid alone.
- I'll go.

293
00:10:51,878 --> 00:10:53,712
One, two, three! Lift!

294
00:11:05,997 --> 00:11:08,097
This shouldn't have happened.

295
00:11:08,099 --> 00:11:09,999
I made a felony stop.

296
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,535
Rios just charged.

297
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:15,538
I mean, he's made mistakes
before, but never like this.

298
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,006
He knows...

299
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:19,210
stop at a safe distance,
wait for backup,

300
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:21,595
- approach with caution, but...
- It hap... It happens.

301
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:22,990
Rookies aren't used to the adrenaline.

302
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:24,812
They get amped up. It's
lights and sirens syndrome.

303
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,949
I told him on day one. I told him.

304
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:29,986
It's the hardest part
about being a T.O. Okay?

305
00:11:29,988 --> 00:11:33,456
We drill it into their head,
but at the end of the day,

306
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,758
they make their own calls.

307
00:11:36,061 --> 00:11:37,960
Still feels like my fault.

308
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:39,606
No. Come on.

309
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:41,298
You hurt?

310
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,615
Nah, I just... just tweaked
it pulling him out of danger.

311
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:45,721
- I'm alright.
- 7-Adam-19,

312
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:47,704
send an additional R.A. to my location.

313
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,572
You're gonna be okay.

314
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,841
Look at me. Look at me. Alright?

315
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:53,810
Remember the obstacle
course at the Academy?

316
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:56,012
First time through,
you had a torn hamstring

317
00:11:56,014 --> 00:11:57,470
and still beat me.

318
00:11:57,472 --> 00:11:59,883
Yeah, and I practiced
every single day after that,

319
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,107
knowing that you'd be coming for me.

320
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:03,244
I was only number one because
you were there pushing me.

321
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:05,722
And now I'm gonna be here pushing you,

322
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,857
getting you back to your feet.

323
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:08,891
Alright?

324
00:12:08,893 --> 00:12:10,827
Okay, and I expect your
"A" game, man, alright?

325
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:12,695
None of that "I got shot" B.S.
You hear me?

326
00:12:13,898 --> 00:12:15,031
Chris, you hear me, man?

327
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:19,091
He's losing too much blood!

328
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:20,570
- How much further?!
- Three minutes out.

329
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,872
Chris. Come on, Chris.
Stay with me, man! Come on!

330
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:23,940
Chris!

331
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:29,045
There.

332
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,525
Nolan. Door.

333
00:12:42,627 --> 00:12:43,760
Got a gun.

334
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,762
You need to secure it while
I go after the suspect.

335
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,829
I'll go with you.

336
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:48,765
No, that gun is a crucial
piece of evidence,

337
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,093
and TID has their hands full
processing the shooting scene,

338
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:53,264
so I am designating you the finder.

339
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:54,771
Photograph everything.

340
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,039
Make sure you get that gun
exactly how it was found.

341
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,431
Glove up, collect it, and
store it in our shop's lock box.

342
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:00,643
- You got it?
- Yes, ma'am.

343
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:02,612
Control, 7-Adam-15.

344
00:13:02,614 --> 00:13:03,869
Suspect vehicle located

345
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,285
in a parking structure on 6th and Grand.

346
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:08,474
Gun on scene. My T.O.
is in pursuit of suspect

347
00:13:08,476 --> 00:13:11,120
through a maintenance door
on the northeast corner.

348
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:12,955
Need backup. Code 3.

349
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:49,492
Control, 7-Adam-15.

350
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:51,099
Shut down all code 3 units.

351
00:13:51,101 --> 00:13:52,528
Suspect is G.O.A.

352
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,830
Damn it.

353
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:56,943
25-year-old male,

354
00:13:56,945 --> 00:13:58,667
single gunshot wound to the chest.

355
00:13:58,669 --> 00:14:01,464
Possible lung collapse. He's
down two liters of blood.

356
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,522
Aren't you taking him to surgery?

357
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:04,483
If I don't stop the bleeding,
he won't make it to the OR.

358
00:14:04,485 --> 00:14:06,186
Three, two, one.

359
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:08,978
Get a gurney. Clear Trauma 1.

360
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,546
Get him on the monitor.

361
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:14,617
Jackson, I hear... I heard
what happened. Is he... ?

362
00:14:14,619 --> 00:14:16,442
They're, um... They're
trying to stabilize him.

363
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:17,566
He lost a lot of blood.

364
00:14:17,568 --> 00:14:19,055
- Oh, my God.
- No.

365
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:20,857
Get it out.

366
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,483
I have to go back to the station, okay?

367
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:28,297
I got a mandatory callback, but...

368
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,533
will you call me with any news?

369
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:32,635
Of course. I'm... I'm
not going anywhere.

370
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,547
Okay, scene's secure.

371
00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:46,215
What the hell are you doing?

372
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:48,184
You holding something
in your right hand?

373
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:49,218
Your gun hand?

374
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,860
How many times I gotta tell you

375
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:52,539
to keep your gun hand free at all times?

376
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,589
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

377
00:14:53,591 --> 00:14:55,211
You've been on this job a whole
year, and you're still making

378
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:57,326
the same dumb mistakes you've
been making since day one.

379
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:58,594
You want to end up like Rios?

380
00:14:58,596 --> 00:14:59,862
Whoa, Tim.

381
00:14:59,864 --> 00:15:01,931
That's enough, man.

382
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:02,965
Excuse me?

383
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:04,634
You don't have to talk to her like that.

384
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:05,668
She's my Boot.

385
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,570
I'll talk to her however
the hell I want to

386
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:10,202
so she doesn't end up eating
through a tube the rest of her life.

387
00:15:10,204 --> 00:15:11,337
You got that?

388
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:13,510
Let's go, Boot.

389
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:17,613
I did not need saving.

390
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:26,355
I kind of went overboard
with the crime scene photos.

391
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:27,924
Better safe than sorry.

392
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:39,682
No sign of the suspect?

393
00:15:39,684 --> 00:15:42,238
No, he got away clean. But
we did recover his weapon.

394
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,639
Nine-mil. Recently fired.

395
00:15:43,641 --> 00:15:45,241
Good work. Anything else?

396
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:48,058
Uh, yes. The car is
registered to a dealership...

397
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,558
International Luxury Auto.

398
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,714
- Stolen?
- Not reported.

399
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:54,050
We need to run background checks
on the dealership employees.

400
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:56,414
Already happening. But
we would get a much faster ID

401
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,521
from the mobile fingerprint
unit inside your car.

402
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:00,957
We pulled a clean print from
the driver's side window.

403
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,060
Uh, yeah. Great.

404
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,968
Any update on Chris?

405
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,959
- Nothing yet.
- How is it out there?

406
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:15,037
Controlled chaos.

407
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:17,574
We're spread thin through two divisions.

408
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:25,982
And just like that,
our suspect has a name.

409
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:28,985
Serj Derian. Number one on
Robbery-Homicide's hit list.

410
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,152
Younger brother of Ruben,

411
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:31,854
the head of the Derian crime family.

412
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:33,656
Linked to drug trafficking, extortion,

413
00:16:33,658 --> 00:16:34,797
kidnapping, and murder.

414
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,026
But so far, none of
the charges have stuck.

415
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:40,329
Now, remember, this guy has
already shot one cop today.

416
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:42,765
I need you focused, not angry.

417
00:16:49,874 --> 00:16:50,917
LAPD!

418
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,010
Serj Derian, come out
with your hands up!

419
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:02,051
- Clear!
- Clear!

420
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,219
- Clear!
- Clear!

421
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:05,121
- Clear!
- Clear!

422
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:06,222
Clear!

423
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:09,358
He's not here.

424
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:12,261
Hey, you gotta go.

425
00:17:12,263 --> 00:17:14,063
I know, but how can I?

426
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:15,197
Serj wasn't home.

427
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,366
Bradford and Chen are
searching his stuff right now.

428
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:18,834
What'd I miss?

429
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:21,037
Harper has a custody
hearing in about an hour,

430
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,672
and she's conflicted about leaving,

431
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:25,741
but I say number-one priority
has to be getting Lila back.

432
00:17:25,743 --> 00:17:27,510
Tell me I'm right.

433
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:28,744
100%.

434
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:30,413
Look, take it from me.

435
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:33,916
Nothing is more important than family.

436
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:35,051
Alright, fine.

437
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,286
But I will be back right after.

438
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:38,354
Hey.

439
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:40,861
Take my unmarked. I'll
ride back with Nolan.

440
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,193
- Thanks.
- Give Lila a hug for me.

441
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:49,765
What are we looking for?

442
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,521
Anything that could lead us to Serj.

443
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:54,770
- What the hell?
- You got something?

444
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,906
Yeah, a police report.

445
00:17:56,908 --> 00:17:58,141
There's more.

446
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,876
"Suspect... Serj Derian".

447
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:02,378
His name's all over these.

448
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,846
Someone inside the department

449
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:05,948
has been feeding intel
to the Armenian mob.

450
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,083
And by someone, you mean...

451
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:08,118
A dirty cop.

452
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,181
Come in.

453
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:14,283
Close the door.

454
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,983
So, Bradford and Chen just found
confidential police documents

455
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:23,084
in Serj's home.

456
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:27,423
Case files for LAPD
investigations into the Derians.

457
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:31,565
You saying there's a mole
inside the department?

458
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:34,234
It'd explain why these
guys have been so slippery.

459
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:36,837
So, we haven't been able to
make a single case against them.

460
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:38,295
What does internal affairs say?

461
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,020
They're mobilizing.

462
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:41,875
Commander West was keeping
it close to the vest,

463
00:18:41,877 --> 00:18:45,713
but I got a sense they already
have a few cops in mind.

464
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:47,414
So, what do we do in the meantime?

465
00:18:47,416 --> 00:18:48,682
Serj's older brother... Ruben.

466
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:52,419
He runs things from
his house in Glendale.

467
00:18:52,421 --> 00:18:54,188
There's a chance Serj is holed up there.

468
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:57,424
If not, Ruben's the first
person we should be questioning.

469
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:58,983
Why are you only telling me all this?

470
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:00,674
I know I can trust you.

471
00:19:00,676 --> 00:19:02,666
So I'm making you acting detective

472
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:04,557
until this calms down.

473
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,600
You already passed the
exam, so I might as well

474
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:09,061
take advantage of you
until the brass realizes

475
00:19:09,063 --> 00:19:11,271
- what they're missing out on.
- Copy that.

476
00:19:11,273 --> 00:19:13,207
So, round up as many units as you need,

477
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:15,702
call a judge for a
telephonic search warrant.

478
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:17,405
Yes, sir.

479
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:23,051
I've wanted this for
so long, so thank you.

480
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:26,721
Just wish a cop didn't have
to get shot for it to happen.

481
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:29,923
We answer the call when we get it.

482
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:38,233
Still thinking about Grace?

483
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:40,634
You're a good detective.

484
00:19:40,636 --> 00:19:41,835
You're an easy case.

485
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:44,438
Days like today just make you realize

486
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,907
how little time you could have.

487
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:48,609
Time I want to spend with her.

488
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:51,051
That's the kind of thing you
might regret not telling someone.

489
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:54,816
You know what? When
we get back to the station,

490
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,483
I'm gonna book the evidence
and I'm gonna call her.

491
00:19:56,485 --> 00:19:57,584
Call her?

492
00:19:57,586 --> 00:19:59,246
You better get your ass over there

493
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:00,481
and tell her in person.

494
00:20:03,325 --> 00:20:06,360
They're putting together a
raid at Ruben Derian's house.

495
00:20:06,362 --> 00:20:07,494
Is Serj there?

496
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:09,152
Only one way to find out.

497
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:13,500
Control, 7-Adam-15.
Attach us to that ATL.

498
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:24,344
Lock and load.

499
00:20:24,346 --> 00:20:25,612
Any eye on Serj?

500
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:27,771
Not yet, but there's at least
a handful of unknowns inside.

501
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,683
- What's the game plan?
- House is around the corner.

502
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:31,985
I'll have officers cover the perimeter
while the rest of us breach.

503
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:34,521
I would put Stapleton, Cole,
and Brady on the 3/4 corner.

504
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:36,690
Jennings and Sanchez,
they can take the 2 side.

505
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:38,493
We'll join you in the stack.

506
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:43,163
- Sorry. Second nature.
- All good, sir.

507
00:20:43,165 --> 00:20:45,532
You're the senior detective
on site. Operation is yours.

508
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:46,723
Okay.

509
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:47,801
Uh...

510
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:48,836
You're acting detective?

511
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:50,704
- For the day.
- Doing great.

512
00:20:50,706 --> 00:20:52,506
- Hey.
- Hey.

513
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:54,408
Wish I was breaching with you guys.

514
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,376
It'd feel good to subdue a
felon with force right now.

515
00:20:56,378 --> 00:20:57,711
Only temporarily.

516
00:20:57,713 --> 00:20:58,746
- Be safe.
- You too.

517
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:02,316
Police! Open up!

518
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:03,851
Hands up! Turn around!

519
00:21:11,601 --> 00:21:13,557
- Clear!
- Clear!

520
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,661
Stand up!

521
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:16,153
Hands on your head! Turn around!

522
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:17,564
What can I do for you?

523
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:19,867
We have a warrant to search
the premises for Serj Derian.

524
00:21:19,869 --> 00:21:21,155
You could have just called.

525
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:24,338
So much banging and
crashing just to discover

526
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,273
that my brother didn't randomly drop by.

527
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:27,641
All clear. No sign of Serj.

528
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:30,344
Mr. Derian, we'd like you to come
with us to the station voluntarily.

529
00:21:30,346 --> 00:21:31,411
Yeah, you bet.

530
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:33,480
Uh, look, why don't I meet
you guys down there, huh?

531
00:21:33,482 --> 00:21:34,548
There's only a half-hour left

532
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:36,517
in what has been the
best game of the season.

533
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:38,619
- It's zero-zero.
- A tactical master class.

534
00:21:39,688 --> 00:21:41,588
Your brother shot a cop.
You're coming with us now.

535
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,689
On what charge?

536
00:21:42,691 --> 00:21:44,358
You're a material witness
to your brother's actions,

537
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,608
and refusing to help could be construed

538
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,428
- as aiding and abetting.
- Let's move.

539
00:21:58,307 --> 00:22:00,407
Clear.

540
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:03,076
Negative. No response.

541
00:22:04,947 --> 00:22:06,280
Alright, book the evidence.

542
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:07,481
I'm gonna check and see what's next.

543
00:22:07,483 --> 00:22:08,582
Right.

544
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:24,731
Auto registration.

545
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:27,000
And could I get a firearm tag?

546
00:22:28,771 --> 00:22:29,837
Wait a minute.

547
00:22:31,407 --> 00:22:32,773
W-Wait.

548
00:22:32,775 --> 00:22:34,074
Uh...

549
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:37,578
Th... Uh, there was
a gun. There was, um...

550
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,413
There's supposed to be a gun.

551
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:44,418
Sorry.

552
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:26,994
Yeah, I understand. Thank you.

553
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:31,365
Sir, the weapon we
recovered from the Maserati,

554
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:33,635
the gun that was used
to shoot Officer Rios.

555
00:23:34,703 --> 00:23:37,472
I secured it, and now it's missing.

556
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:44,645
That call was from the hospital.

557
00:23:44,647 --> 00:23:45,812
Chris Rios just died.

558
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,885
That gun is now a murder weapon.

559
00:23:51,887 --> 00:23:53,053
And you lost it.

560
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
Can we talk about what happened earlier?

561
00:24:04,775 --> 00:24:06,041
When earlier?

562
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:07,409
With Emmett.

563
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:08,777
There's nothing to say.

564
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:10,479
The guy tried to tell
me how to do my job.

565
00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:12,414
On today of all days.

566
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:14,206
I don't care if he's your boyfriend...

567
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,964
He's not.

568
00:24:15,966 --> 00:24:18,022
Actually, he's a little
dead to me right now.

569
00:24:18,024 --> 00:24:20,732
You may be 30 days from
crossing the finish line,

570
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:22,657
but the only thing that
happens when you cross it

571
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:25,850
is that I won't be there to
keep you from washing out.

572
00:24:25,852 --> 00:24:27,308
Or worse.

573
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,493
So you better believe

574
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:30,496
this next month is gonna be tough.

575
00:24:32,266 --> 00:24:34,000
'Cause I know you can handle it.

576
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:39,404
That's oddly sweet.

577
00:24:39,406 --> 00:24:41,740
But you're not the one
I'm mad at right now.

578
00:24:41,742 --> 00:24:43,242
I'm used to you. I...

579
00:24:43,244 --> 00:24:45,244
Okay, look.

580
00:24:45,246 --> 00:24:48,547
You are only gonna
hear me say this once.

581
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:49,715
Emmett's a fireman.

582
00:24:49,717 --> 00:24:50,749
They're idiots.

583
00:24:50,751 --> 00:24:52,751
But they mean well.

584
00:24:52,753 --> 00:24:54,286
And Emmett...

585
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:56,823
... he's a not-bad fireman.

586
00:24:57,949 --> 00:24:59,371
Don't write him off.

587
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,242
I thought we weren't going
to discuss my personal life.

588
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,874
We're friends.

589
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:08,701
Hmm.

590
00:25:10,304 --> 00:25:11,370
Hey.

591
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:17,609
Chris died.

592
00:25:23,751 --> 00:25:25,351
Oh, no.

593
00:25:27,588 --> 00:25:30,422
I can't leave you alone for a second.

594
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:32,291
Hey. How was court? Did the judge...

595
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:34,159
He's gonna make his
decision tomorrow morning.

596
00:25:34,161 --> 00:25:36,228
But how about we focus
on the murder weapon

597
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,950
that went missing from the shop?

598
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:41,166
Okay, you saw me bag it...

599
00:25:41,168 --> 00:25:43,402
and put it in the lock box.

600
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:45,904
The only time we stopped
between the scene and the station

601
00:25:45,906 --> 00:25:47,606
was at Serj's house, for the raid.

602
00:25:47,608 --> 00:25:49,174
Could one of his guys have taken it?

603
00:25:49,176 --> 00:25:50,298
No, not possible.

604
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,061
We had the perimeter completely
contained, and I locked the car.

605
00:25:53,063 --> 00:25:55,180
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

606
00:25:55,182 --> 00:25:57,559
Mostly sure. Almost mostly sure.

607
00:25:57,561 --> 00:26:00,463
Even if I didn't, it was
secured in the lock box.

608
00:26:01,655 --> 00:26:03,655
And there's no sign of forced entry.

609
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:05,257
- None.
- You find the gun?

610
00:26:05,259 --> 00:26:07,159
No, and I don't think he's going to.

611
00:26:07,161 --> 00:26:08,226
Why?

612
00:26:08,228 --> 00:26:10,295
The lock box in the
shop wasn't broken into,

613
00:26:10,297 --> 00:26:12,931
but the key for the boxes
is universal across the LAPD.

614
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,499
You think a cop took the gun?

615
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:16,668
It's the only logical explanation.

616
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,704
We know there's a dirty
cop connected to Serj.

617
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:20,806
They must have heard on the
radio I'd secured the weapon.

618
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:22,941
How long were you away from
the shop during the raid?

619
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:24,543
Uh, we were, what, 20 minutes?

620
00:26:24,545 --> 00:26:26,645
More than enough time for
one of the officers involved

621
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:27,946
to take the gun.

622
00:26:27,948 --> 00:26:29,881
It makes sense, but it's cold comfort.

623
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:31,483
Even if we get the weapon back,

624
00:26:31,485 --> 00:26:33,285
the chain of custody has been destroyed.

625
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,387
The D.A. can't use it to convict Serj

626
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:37,356
for the murder of Officer Rios.

627
00:26:37,358 --> 00:26:38,657
If we ever find the guy.

628
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:39,791
Oh, we'll find him.

629
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:41,626
I'm calling all the
officers from the raid

630
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:42,728
back to the station.

631
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,167
Officer Lopez will be in charge

632
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,697
of going through all
the body cam footage.

633
00:26:45,699 --> 00:26:46,798
What can we do?

634
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,867
You and Armstrong can
take a run at Ruben Derian.

635
00:26:48,869 --> 00:26:50,702
See if we can sweat
something out of him.

636
00:26:50,704 --> 00:26:52,204
It'd be my pleasure.

637
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:53,705
Alright. That's all.

638
00:26:53,707 --> 00:26:55,407
Hey, Sarge?

639
00:26:55,409 --> 00:26:57,809
Look, Officer Nolan
conducted himself admirably

640
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:58,844
throughout the raid.

641
00:26:58,846 --> 00:27:00,545
I don't think he's to
blame for what happened.

642
00:27:00,547 --> 00:27:02,647
That'll be my call, Detective.

643
00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:04,383
I'll deal with it
when the time is right.

644
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:05,507
Sir...

645
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:06,885
Nolan.

646
00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:09,721
You do not want to have this
conversation with me right now.

647
00:27:14,561 --> 00:27:16,428
Tell us about your brother.

648
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,363
Serj? He's a nice guy.

649
00:27:18,365 --> 00:27:20,332
A bit of a free spirit.

650
00:27:20,334 --> 00:27:21,500
You two close?

651
00:27:21,502 --> 00:27:22,534
Sure.

652
00:27:22,536 --> 00:27:24,336
But I haven't seen him in a couple days.

653
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:25,871
He takes off sometimes.

654
00:27:25,873 --> 00:27:27,129
Hm.

655
00:27:27,131 --> 00:27:28,440
Wanderlust.

656
00:27:28,442 --> 00:27:30,575
Those Germans.

657
00:27:30,577 --> 00:27:32,577
They really have a word
for everything, don't they?

658
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:34,513
But you reported his
car stolen this morning.

659
00:27:34,515 --> 00:27:36,381
An hour after it was used in an incident

660
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:38,583
that ended with a dead police officer.

661
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:40,585
The Maserati belongs to
the Derians' dealership.

662
00:27:40,587 --> 00:27:42,287
It was found missing during inventory.

663
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:43,422
How convenient.

664
00:27:43,424 --> 00:27:45,690
Dozens of people have driven
that car in the past week.

665
00:27:45,692 --> 00:27:48,138
Now, my client has
been very cooperative,

666
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,574
so if you don't have
any more questions...

667
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:54,266
Alright, if you hear from
your brother, give us a call.

668
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:55,700
He killed a cop.

669
00:27:55,702 --> 00:27:57,769
He is going to prison.

670
00:27:57,771 --> 00:27:59,304
It is up to you to decide

671
00:27:59,306 --> 00:28:01,773
whether or not you are going with him.

672
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:03,242
I'll keep that in mind.

673
00:28:09,716 --> 00:28:11,483
Now what?

674
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:14,545
We find a new way to flush
Serj out into the open.

675
00:28:14,547 --> 00:28:16,788
What the hell do you need
our body cams for, Sarge?

676
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,457
Above your pay grade.

677
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:19,525
Come on.

678
00:28:20,854 --> 00:28:21,987
Oh, hey, Cole.

679
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:24,729
How you holding up?

680
00:28:24,731 --> 00:28:25,931
Not well.

681
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,332
I should have said something.

682
00:28:27,334 --> 00:28:29,569
Hey, no. This... This is not your fault.

683
00:28:34,077 --> 00:28:35,599
House is around the corner.

684
00:28:35,601 --> 00:28:37,085
I'll have officers cover the perimeter

685
00:28:37,087 --> 00:28:38,210
while the rest of us breach.

686
00:28:38,212 --> 00:28:40,412
Okay, I would put Shelton,
Cole, and Boyd on the...

687
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:50,589
We have a warrant to search
the premises for Serj Derian.

688
00:28:55,896 --> 00:28:59,965
Double-O-Smitty. At your service.

689
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:02,601
That man clearly does not know
the "on" button from the "off".

690
00:29:16,483 --> 00:29:18,884
Officer Erin Cole never switched
her camera on during the raid.

691
00:29:18,886 --> 00:29:20,936
She's a rookie, so it could
just be a mental error.

692
00:29:20,938 --> 00:29:23,159
Or she did it on purpose
to cover up taking the gun.

693
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,523
Either way, we need to talk to her.

694
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:27,012
I can reach out to her T.O.,
call her back to the station.

695
00:29:27,014 --> 00:29:29,306
No need. Cole's ID badge
shows she's still here...

696
00:29:29,308 --> 00:29:30,364
in the locker room.

697
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:40,839
She dumped everything that
we could use to trace her.

698
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:41,841
She's running.

699
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,296
How was Officer Cole at the Academy?

700
00:29:49,298 --> 00:29:50,390
Solid.

701
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:52,281
Yeah, she was a go-getter.

702
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:54,429
I mean, she wasn't the
strongest or the fastest,

703
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:56,086
but she made up for it with passion.

704
00:29:56,088 --> 00:29:57,227
I certainly wouldn't have flagged her

705
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:58,866
as someone who'd betray the badge.

706
00:29:58,868 --> 00:30:00,554
- And as a rookie?
- Maybe she didn't turn.

707
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:02,370
Maybe she was rotten from the onset.

708
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:03,504
Meaning what?

709
00:30:03,506 --> 00:30:06,595
She was put into the
department by the Derian family

710
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:07,697
as a mole?

711
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,480
- Anything?
- No.

712
00:30:12,482 --> 00:30:14,215
No sign of Cole yet.

713
00:30:14,217 --> 00:30:17,218
An S.I.S. team conducted
a raid on her home

714
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,953
and searched the home
of two family members.

715
00:30:18,955 --> 00:30:21,255
- Nothing.
- Forensic Accounting says there's been

716
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:23,291
no financial activity
on any of her accounts.

717
00:30:23,293 --> 00:30:24,392
Well, she's a cop.

718
00:30:24,394 --> 00:30:26,059
Smart enough to know how
we're gonna try and catch her.

719
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:29,263
And to know that every available
uniform will be looking for her.

720
00:30:29,265 --> 00:30:30,965
She'll probably flee to somewhere

721
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:32,467
that's familiar to her.

722
00:30:32,469 --> 00:30:34,268
The question is, how will she get there?

723
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,603
We put a BOLO out county-wide.

724
00:30:35,605 --> 00:30:37,438
The Sheriff's Department, Metro Transit,

725
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,199
Port Police all been notified.

726
00:30:39,201 --> 00:30:41,210
- Eyes are open.
- John.

727
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:43,985
Uh... excuse me.

728
00:30:45,141 --> 00:30:47,181
I'm so sorry about Officer Rios.

729
00:30:47,183 --> 00:30:48,216
Thank you.

730
00:30:48,218 --> 00:30:50,452
I know that you guys are
working through the night.

731
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,455
I wasn't sure what to get...
I mean, dinner, breakfast?

732
00:30:54,457 --> 00:30:56,858
No, uh, no, pizza always plays.

733
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,359
You guys want to grab this for the... ?

734
00:30:58,361 --> 00:30:59,428
Yeah.

735
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,366
Anyway, I mean, I-I know you're busy.

736
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:10,211
I just want you to know
that I'm thinking about you.

737
00:31:11,341 --> 00:31:12,941
I'm thinking about you, too.

738
00:31:14,844 --> 00:31:16,878
Um...

739
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,546
thank you so much for the food.

740
00:31:18,548 --> 00:31:20,014
Uh...

741
00:31:20,016 --> 00:31:21,083
talk soon?

742
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:23,218
Yeah.

743
00:31:25,355 --> 00:31:27,054
Bye.

744
00:31:31,995 --> 00:31:34,228
Hey. Everything okay?

745
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,035
Um, no. But that's a
problem for another day.

746
00:31:37,037 --> 00:31:39,305
Right now, we need to find Erin.

747
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:42,503
What are you looking at?

748
00:31:42,505 --> 00:31:45,006
I'm just going over all
her social media accounts.

749
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:46,750
I'm just hoping to
find something in here

750
00:31:46,752 --> 00:31:49,053
that'll give us a clue
as to where she went.

751
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:51,345
I just don't get it.

752
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:53,648
She's so happy and carefree.

753
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,650
W-What could happen to make her do this?

754
00:31:55,652 --> 00:31:58,477
Yeah, I mean, social media
shows the side of us

755
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:00,113
that we want people to see.

756
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:04,559
"#RVlife".

757
00:32:04,561 --> 00:32:06,494
The other night at the bar,

758
00:32:06,496 --> 00:32:09,019
Erin said she wanted to
go on a road trip in an RV

759
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:10,665
just as soon as the
Thirty Day Push was over.

760
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,066
You think that's her escape plan?

761
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:13,501
It would give her mobility.

762
00:32:13,503 --> 00:32:15,343
It would give her a place
to hide off the grid.

763
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:30,855
The house the RV is registered to

764
00:32:30,857 --> 00:32:32,042
is at the end of this street.

765
00:32:32,044 --> 00:32:33,087
On our go.

766
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:35,089
I hope she surrenders without a fight.

767
00:32:35,091 --> 00:32:36,223
I wouldn't count on it.

768
00:32:36,225 --> 00:32:37,625
If she's in deep with the Derians,

769
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:40,428
she knows they'll kill her
to keep her from talking.

770
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,232
She's on the move!

771
00:32:46,936 --> 00:32:48,369
Watch out. Watch out!

772
00:32:51,975 --> 00:32:53,240
Control, 7-Adam-15.

773
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:55,943
We just got 245'd by
suspect Cole in an RV.

774
00:32:55,945 --> 00:32:57,712
Beige RV, Arizona plates.

775
00:32:57,714 --> 00:33:01,148
Alpha-Bravo-7-9, heading north
on Mission Road towards 1st.

776
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:27,475
Look out.

777
00:33:39,689 --> 00:33:41,288
Whoa!

778
00:33:47,664 --> 00:33:48,763
Look out!

779
00:33:50,156 --> 00:33:51,916
She's gonna go through.
She's not gonna stop.

780
00:34:01,644 --> 00:34:02,777
Attention, all units.

781
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,046
Air-16 tracking suspect vehicle

782
00:34:05,048 --> 00:34:08,482
heading east on Colorado
towards Pasadena.

783
00:34:18,361 --> 00:34:19,546
- Clear.
- Clear.

784
00:34:19,548 --> 00:34:20,753
- What do we got?
- She's on foot.

785
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:22,450
- Couple minutes ahead.
- Alright, head inside.

786
00:34:22,452 --> 00:34:24,131
Split up. She could be anywhere.

787
00:34:26,302 --> 00:34:28,636
Control, suspect is on foot.
Rose Bowl Stadium.

788
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:30,237
Requesting backup and airship.

789
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:11,446
Erin!

790
00:35:12,606 --> 00:35:14,129
Erin!

791
00:35:14,131 --> 00:35:15,353
Drop that gun right now!

792
00:35:15,355 --> 00:35:17,218
I can't.

793
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,220
Come on, Erin.

794
00:35:19,222 --> 00:35:21,589
It's me. You know me.

795
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:23,724
We've been through a lot
together. You can talk to me.

796
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:25,193
Just talk to me.

797
00:35:26,388 --> 00:35:28,444
I never wanted this.

798
00:35:28,446 --> 00:35:30,264
I know.

799
00:35:32,435 --> 00:35:35,202
I had problems.

800
00:35:35,204 --> 00:35:38,239
Debts, and... they paid them.

801
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:40,741
And and then they owned me.

802
00:35:40,743 --> 00:35:42,243
Who did?

803
00:35:42,245 --> 00:35:43,377
The Derians?

804
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:45,446
I finally paid them back,

805
00:35:45,448 --> 00:35:46,881
and I told Serj I was done,

806
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:49,116
but he... he pulled a gun

807
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:51,452
and he tried to kill me
when I wouldn't scare and...

808
00:35:51,454 --> 00:35:53,320
The shots fired call.

809
00:35:53,322 --> 00:35:55,122
Serj, he... he got caught flat-footed,

810
00:35:55,124 --> 00:35:58,425
and he... he jumped
in the Maserati, and...

811
00:35:58,427 --> 00:36:00,628
Chris is dead because of me.

812
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,831
No, no, no! Wait, no! Don't! Just...

813
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:06,634
It doesn't have to all be for nothing.

814
00:36:06,636 --> 00:36:09,770
Okay, you can start to make this right.

815
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:10,938
Just...

816
00:36:13,252 --> 00:36:15,075
... name names.

817
00:36:15,077 --> 00:36:16,600
Okay? Just testify.

818
00:36:20,197 --> 00:36:21,297
- Armstrong.
- No!

819
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:41,502
Control, uh, requesting an R.A. unit.

820
00:36:41,504 --> 00:36:42,870
25-year-old female,

821
00:36:42,872 --> 00:36:44,371
multiple gunshot wounds to the chest.

822
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:46,935
Not conscious, not breathing.

823
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:01,761
I know you're all exhausted.

824
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:08,164
The past twenty-four hours have
brought a... lot of heartache.

825
00:37:08,166 --> 00:37:10,300
You did great work out there.

826
00:37:10,302 --> 00:37:11,735
Remember that.

827
00:37:11,737 --> 00:37:14,671
I was notified that
Rios's memorial service

828
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:15,773
is Saturday afternoon.

829
00:37:18,043 --> 00:37:19,709
Go home, get some rest.

830
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,580
Nolan.

831
00:37:23,582 --> 00:37:24,988
I'm gonna need you to stay behind.

832
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,679
IA is requesting your statement

833
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:28,143
while it's still fresh in your mind.

834
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,212
Yes, sir.

835
00:37:32,224 --> 00:37:33,624
Hey.

836
00:37:36,561 --> 00:37:38,061
You okay?

837
00:37:40,065 --> 00:37:42,065
I thought I had a chance
at getting through to her.

838
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:47,203
I had no choice.

839
00:37:47,205 --> 00:37:49,606
Oh, I...

840
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:50,941
I know.

841
00:37:52,611 --> 00:37:54,210
Just such a waste.

842
00:38:02,587 --> 00:38:04,555
You want me to make you some tea?

843
00:38:05,857 --> 00:38:07,124
I'm okay.

844
00:38:09,928 --> 00:38:11,628
Come here.

845
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:21,271
Doesn't feel real, you know?

846
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:23,306
I know.

847
00:38:32,117 --> 00:38:33,260
It's Emmett.

848
00:38:33,262 --> 00:38:35,652
Yeah, uh, you two should talk.

849
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:45,328
Hey.

850
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,729
Hey.

851
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:49,399
I screwed up.

852
00:38:50,936 --> 00:38:53,002
Yeah. You did.

853
00:38:57,742 --> 00:38:59,043
Come in.

854
00:39:05,817 --> 00:39:07,017
Uh...

855
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:13,323
You're one of the toughest
women I've ever met.

856
00:39:13,325 --> 00:39:15,425
The last thing you need is a protector,

857
00:39:15,427 --> 00:39:18,695
and I didn't mean to imply that you did.

858
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:21,455
I'm sorry.

859
00:39:23,178 --> 00:39:24,200
Thanks.

860
00:39:25,937 --> 00:39:27,370
I accept your apology.

861
00:39:29,174 --> 00:39:30,306
Really?

862
00:39:31,877 --> 00:39:33,309
Yes.

863
00:39:33,311 --> 00:39:34,777
Yes.

864
00:39:39,151 --> 00:39:41,317
You gotta get out of here.

865
00:39:44,022 --> 00:39:46,022
Alright.

866
00:39:46,024 --> 00:39:47,457
Whatever you say, boss.

867
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:51,327
Will I see you tomorrow?

868
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:52,896
Yeah. Yeah.

869
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:53,997
Cool.

870
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:27,630
How'd it go?

871
00:40:27,632 --> 00:40:31,401
Oh. Like opening a vein.

872
00:40:31,403 --> 00:40:33,069
You want to hear some good news?

873
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:34,170
God, yes.

874
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:37,874
My lawyer just called.

875
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:40,076
I got my kid back.

876
00:40:40,078 --> 00:40:42,412
Shared custody. No conditions.

877
00:40:42,414 --> 00:40:44,347
That's everything you wanted.

878
00:40:44,349 --> 00:40:46,182
Nyla, congratulations!

879
00:40:46,184 --> 00:40:48,084
You helped me get here, John.

880
00:40:48,086 --> 00:40:50,660
Just... know that.

881
00:40:50,662 --> 00:40:51,717
Thank you.

882
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:54,557
And thanks for telling me.

883
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,861
Uh... I needed some good news today.

884
00:40:58,941 --> 00:40:59,963
Hey.

885
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:01,531
Don't beat yourself up.

886
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:03,299
You did everything you were supposed to.

887
00:41:03,301 --> 00:41:05,236
I just wish Erin would have given us

888
00:41:05,238 --> 00:41:06,951
something more concrete before she died,

889
00:41:06,953 --> 00:41:09,906
because Serj is gonna
walk for Chris's murder.

890
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,315
... is dead because of me.

891
00:41:19,317 --> 00:41:21,818
No, no, no! Wait, no! Don't!

892
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,885
It doesn't have to all be for nothing.

893
00:41:22,887 --> 00:41:24,887
Okay, you can start to make this right.

894
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:27,541
Name names, okay? Just testify.

895
00:41:27,543 --> 00:41:28,632
- Armstrong.
- No!

896
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:32,895
Armstrong.

897
00:41:32,897 --> 00:41:35,398
She said his name before she saw him.

898
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:52,796
You did good, my friend.

899
00:41:52,798 --> 00:41:54,150
Very good.
