1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,164
All jewelry must be removed
by the arresting officer.

2
00:00:07,164 --> 00:00:08,203
Do I have your permission
to proceed?

3
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:44,673
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
whoa, oh, oh ♪

4
00:00:44,673 --> 00:00:50,239
♪ I'm gonna win for you
like I know you want me to do ♪

5
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:55,224
Hey.

6
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:56,802
Happy Half‐Year Anniversary.

7
00:00:56,802 --> 00:00:59,336
That's not a thing.

8
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:02,120
Well, maybe not for
cynical police officers,

9
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,366
but for
tender‐hearted lawyers,

10
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:05,483
it's totally a thing.

11
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:08,807
But, hey, if you don't want
to go to n/naka tonight, eh...

12
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:10,552
You got a reservation?

13
00:01:10,552 --> 00:01:11,880
You need to make those
like six ‐‐

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,127
Six months in advance.
I know.

15
00:01:13,127 --> 00:01:15,412
I love your confidence.

16
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:18,776
Wait.

17
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:21,020
We've only been dating
for five months.

18
00:01:22,972 --> 00:01:24,967
Yeah, well, technically,
but ‐‐

19
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:27,251
Did you make that reservation
for someone else

20
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:29,493
and hope I wouldn't remember
exactly when we hooked up?

21
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:34,602
If I say yes,
are you gonna say no?

22
00:01:34,602 --> 00:01:36,762
Are you kidding?
I would kill to eat there.

23
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:38,548
But I'm gonna require

24
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:41,457
some serious
shower time...

25
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:43,242
Oh.
...for you
to make amends.

26
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:48,268
Deal. Yeah.

27
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:49,723
Whoa. Okay.

28
00:01:49,723 --> 00:01:51,716
We've got a problem.

29
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:55,413
I just got an invitation
to a wedding.

30
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:56,868
Yeah.
I don't do weddings.

31
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:58,444
I don't know
what that means,

32
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:00,523
and I wasn't
inviting you.

33
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:03,056
Um, Lucy got
the same invitation.

34
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,839
The couple getting married
is her ex‐boyfriend

35
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,584
and her ex‐best friend.
Let me guess.

36
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:09,120
They hooked up while Lucy
was still dating him.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,408
<i>Living with him.
Mm.</i>

38
00:02:10,408 --> 00:02:12,526
She's obviously
devastated,

39
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:14,812
so maybe take it easy
on her today.

40
00:02:14,812 --> 00:02:16,806
Look, Chen is my rookie,
not my friend.

41
00:02:16,806 --> 00:02:17,968
My job is to train her,

42
00:02:17,968 --> 00:02:19,961
not help her through
her messy social life.

43
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:29,185
Fine.
I'll dial it down, like, 2%.

44
00:02:29,185 --> 00:02:30,389
That's my guy.

45
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,996
It is hot as the surface
of the sun out there.

46
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:37,616
Yep.
Gonna be like that all week.

47
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,361
Good thing we're all
in short sleeves now.

48
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:40,524
The uniforms
are still wool.

49
00:02:40,524 --> 00:02:42,351
Today's gonna be
a nightmare.

50
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:43,763
I'm just saying ‐‐

51
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,633
I don't get out of the car
for less than a felony

52
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,087
when the needle
hits 100.

53
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:49,164
Your commitment to protecting
and serving is admirable.

54
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:51,740
As long as I can do it
in comfort.

55
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,439
You know the front row's
for the rookies, right?

56
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,059
You hoping
I'll sit by you?

57
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:57,347
I'm just telling you
how it is.

58
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:58,593
The day
I need that from you

59
00:02:58,593 --> 00:02:59,507
is the day
I hang up my spurs.

60
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:02,248
You know you're losing,
right?

61
00:03:02,248 --> 00:03:04,284
Good morning.

62
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,322
We've got ourselves a heat wave,

63
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:06,651
which means what,
Officer West?

64
00:03:06,651 --> 00:03:08,396
Studies show
that a 1% loss of body mass

65
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,684
due to sweating

66
00:03:09,684 --> 00:03:11,179
decreases
cognitive ability

67
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:12,841
and increases
anxiety levels.

68
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:14,544
Translation ‐‐
tempers will be short,

69
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:16,164
drug and alcohol use up,

70
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:17,908
so stay hydrated
and stay sharp.

71
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:20,692
Now, while the rest of you
are baking in the sun,

72
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:22,685
Officer Nolan
will be flop‐sweating

73
00:03:22,685 --> 00:03:24,970
in his very first
preliminary court hearing.

74
00:03:26,382 --> 00:03:28,127
Oh, no flop sweats here,
sir.

75
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:30,452
I have reviewed
the arrest report repeatedly.

76
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:33,195
I am 100% ready to testify
on all the facts.

77
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:34,815
Hmm. Bradford?

78
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,351
When did you graduate
the Academy?

79
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:38,968
Oh, that was September...
Exact date, Boot.

80
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,963
What's your weapon's
serial number?

81
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:42,956
I don't know the ‐‐
You need to know
the number by heart.

82
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,033
For a DUI arrest?
I didn't even draw my weapon.

83
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:47,442
If you don't even have
your personal information
squared away,

84
00:03:47,442 --> 00:03:49,602
how could you possibly know
the facts of the case?

85
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:51,388
A defense attorney's job
is to screw you up on the stand

86
00:03:51,388 --> 00:03:53,299
by any means necessary.

87
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,293
Which means
everything that connects

88
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:57,329
to your experience on the job
is in bounds.

89
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,657
Got it?

90
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:00,360
Yes, sir.

91
00:04:04,763 --> 00:04:06,301
You're driving today,
Boot.
What?

92
00:04:06,301 --> 00:04:07,920
You heard me.
Why?

93
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,371
Look,
if you don't want to ‐‐
N‐No, no. I do.

94
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,338
What's the catch?
Why does there
have to be a catch?

95
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:23,540
There's always a catch.
Not today.

96
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:34,007
Well, that can't be legal.

97
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:35,834
It's not.
Light him up.

98
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:47,132
You're not coming?

99
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:49,044
It's a low‐risk misdemeanor.
You got this.

100
00:04:54,484 --> 00:04:56,729
Ahh.

101
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,219
Hey.
Hi.

102
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:14,756
What are you doing here?

103
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:16,125
Well, it's your first time
in court.

104
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,373
I thought you'd ‐‐
you'd appreciate

105
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:18,536
a friendly face
in the gallery.

106
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:20,072
Well, thank God.

107
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:21,983
At roll call this morning,
Grey had me freaked out.

108
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:24,185
He told me this was
predetermined to be a disaster.

109
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:25,265
The first one always is.

110
00:05:25,265 --> 00:05:26,637
Was yours?

111
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,297
Ugh. Especially mine.

112
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:29,627
Good morning.

113
00:05:29,627 --> 00:05:31,497
Wesley. Whoa.

114
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,739
You got a case
on the docket today?
Yep. Yours.

115
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:36,231
Defense counsel ate
some bad lamb last night,

116
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:38,391
asked me to step in.
Outstanding.

117
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:39,596
N‐Not about the ‐‐
the lamb,

118
00:05:39,596 --> 00:05:41,009
but that ‐‐ that it's ‐‐
that it's you.

119
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,462
He's a little nervous.

120
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:44,249
It's his first time
in court.

121
00:05:44,249 --> 00:05:46,324
Yeah. I get it.
My first time was disastrous.

122
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:49,357
Look, I'll try to make it
as painless as possible, okay?

123
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:50,604
Thank you very much.

124
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:52,223
Hey, just remember ‐‐

125
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:54,882
whatever happens,
it's not personal.

126
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:56,835
Right.

127
00:05:56,835 --> 00:05:58,621
What does that mean?

128
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:00,947
That I'm the only
friendly face here.

129
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,364
That's my guy,
the one with the ponytail,

130
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:17,188
Brant Reggie, 23‐152,
DUI Drugs.

131
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:22,795
How do I know
the guy next to him?

132
00:06:22,795 --> 00:06:27,116
Oh, that's, um,
Oscar Hutchinson.

133
00:06:27,116 --> 00:06:30,522
He was one of the prison bus
escapees we tracked down.

134
00:06:30,522 --> 00:06:32,848
He's kind of the reason
we're together.

135
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:34,718
How romantic.

136
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:36,088
Good morning.

137
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:37,667
We've got a lot of cases
to get through today,

138
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:38,912
so let's just jump right in.

139
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:40,865
Uh, hi. Uh...

140
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:42,567
Mr. Hutchinson, you've been
in my courtroom enough

141
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,063
to know that
this isn't a Q&A.

142
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:45,393
Yes, Your Honor.

143
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:47,636
I just wanted to say
I don't mind going last.

144
00:06:47,636 --> 00:06:49,214
I think
these men beside me

145
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:50,876
deserve to be heard from
first.

146
00:06:50,876 --> 00:06:52,537
And you're in no hurry
to go back in the hole.

147
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,239
Interrupt me again,
and I'll have you gagged.

148
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:55,819
Call the first case.

149
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:57,106
People of
the State of California

150
00:06:57,106 --> 00:06:58,436
versus Jonathan Ryland,

151
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:00,471
homicide
in the first degree.

152
00:07:18,623 --> 00:07:20,741
Is everything okay?

153
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,528
That man killed our son.

154
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:28,053
I'm so sorry.

155
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:34,242
Thank you, sir.
Color's all off, man.

156
00:07:34,242 --> 00:07:36,485
It's not even
the right color green.
What's up, Amari?

157
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:37,648
Man, this fool took
a counterfeit $100

158
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:38,728
without even checking it.

159
00:07:38,728 --> 00:07:40,348
<i>♪ Black and yellow ♪</i>

160
00:07:40,348 --> 00:07:41,512
<i>♪ Black and yellow,
black and yellow ♪</i>

161
00:07:41,512 --> 00:07:43,255
They misspelled it
"hunderd."

162
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,543
Don't get me started.

163
00:07:44,543 --> 00:07:45,664
You got
a description for us?

164
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:47,866
Oh, better.

165
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,528
<i>♪ I run from my past,
I guess that makes... ♪</i>

166
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:51,854
Come on. You took a $100 bill
from this clown?

167
00:07:51,854 --> 00:07:53,100
How long ago was he here?

168
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,305
30 minutes or so.

169
00:07:54,305 --> 00:07:56,132
I was at couple's counseling.

170
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:57,587
Everything alright
with you and Serena?

171
00:07:57,587 --> 00:08:00,079
You know how it is.
Baby's teething.

172
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,571
We're not sleeping.
I'm working long hours.

173
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:05,769
Yeah. Well, look,
hang in there, alright?

174
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:07,347
Yeah.

175
00:08:07,347 --> 00:08:08,718
Look, we'll put a BOLO out,
cruise the neighborhood.

176
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:11,003
Hopefully we spot him.
Thanks.

177
00:08:11,003 --> 00:08:12,290
Oh, hey,
I'm still out $100, though.

178
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,237
Uh, unfortunately,
yes.

179
00:08:21,222 --> 00:08:22,884
You should've gloved up when you
touched the counterfeit bill

180
00:08:22,884 --> 00:08:24,213
in case we needed
to pull prints.

181
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,123
You're right.
Um, I spaced.

182
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:27,743
I'm sorry.

183
00:08:27,743 --> 00:08:29,779
Wait.

184
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,689
Why didn't you say anything
when we were inside?

185
00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:33,559
No reason.

186
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,424
You always call me out
in front of people

187
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:37,795
when I screw up.

188
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:39,540
First you let me drive,
now this?

189
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,033
Why are you
being nice to me today?
I'm not.

190
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:44,815
Did Rachel talk to you?

191
00:08:46,561 --> 00:08:49,136
She did.
I told her not to.

192
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:50,548
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

193
00:08:50,548 --> 00:08:51,918
I didn't want her to,
either.

194
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:52,957
Look,
this isn't a big deal.

195
00:08:52,957 --> 00:08:54,204
You know,
I ‐‐ I'm over him,

196
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:55,657
and I'm ‐‐
I'm happy for them.

197
00:08:55,657 --> 00:08:58,524
So I don't need any special
treatment from you, okay?

198
00:08:58,524 --> 00:09:00,101
Okay.

199
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:01,306
Then I'm driving.

200
00:09:01,306 --> 00:09:03,051
What? But...

201
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,483
Hey. You called 911?

202
00:09:11,483 --> 00:09:12,729
Yeah.
I was hooking up the car,

203
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,182
and I caught a whiff
of something really bad

204
00:09:14,182 --> 00:09:15,138
coming from that warehouse.

205
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,007
Alright.
I'll check it out. Thanks.

206
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:22,491
Whew. God.

207
00:09:26,603 --> 00:09:28,846
7‐L‐14,
possible DB at location.

208
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:30,675
Stand by for confirmation.

209
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,497
Hey.
Can I call you right back?

210
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:49,407
What?

211
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:50,986
You said visitation
was set.

212
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:53,104
I changed my schedule.

213
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:55,057
I haven't seen my daughter
in over a week.

214
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:57,051
Look,
I don't want to play nice.

215
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:58,089
I want my kid.

216
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:02,327
I got to call you right back.

217
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,603
7‐L‐14, DB on scene.

218
00:10:47,603 --> 00:10:49,721
I need homicide
and forensic team.

219
00:10:49,721 --> 00:10:52,006
But first,
I need animal control.

220
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:56,160
Officer Nolan, did you have
training at the Academy

221
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,905
for DUI suspects?
Uh, yes, sir.

222
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:00,563
40 hours of alcohol
intoxication recognition.

223
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:01,975
Did they test you
on that training?

224
00:11:01,975 --> 00:11:03,014
Of course.

225
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:05,257
And did you score 100%?

226
00:11:06,627 --> 00:11:08,082
No, but I ‐‐

227
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:10,284
Okay, so, on the date
in question ‐‐

228
00:11:10,284 --> 00:11:11,612
March 16th.
Yes. That date.

229
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:13,689
Did you see my client
behind the wheel?

230
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:15,807
N‐No. Your client was
already out of the car

231
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:17,386
by the time
we arrived on scene,

232
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,877
but the driver of
the vehicle he hit ‐‐
Allegedly hit.

233
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:21,831
And please only answer
the questions that I ask you.

234
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:23,865
Now, did you get fingerprints
from the steering wheel

235
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:26,607
to prove that my client
was the driver?

236
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:29,101
No,
but the other driver ‐‐

237
00:11:29,101 --> 00:11:30,388
The other driver,
as you call him,

238
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:31,717
suffered a head injury.

239
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:33,379
Are you telling me
that you identified my client

240
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,953
based solely on
that man's say‐so?

241
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:42,640
Your client owns the car.

242
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,385
Your Honor, can you please
instruct the witness

243
00:11:44,385 --> 00:11:45,425
to answer my question?

244
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:47,625
Officer.
Yeah. Uh, yes.

245
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:51,074
I ID'd your client
as the driver of the vehicle

246
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:53,524
based on
the witness statement.

247
00:11:53,524 --> 00:11:55,643
Okay.

248
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,491
How could I have known
he wasn't wearing pants?

249
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:06,484
No, not just pants ‐‐
bottoms of any kind.

250
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:08,312
I'll never be able
to unsee that.

251
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:11,718
Whoa!
My man, close it up.

252
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:16,287
You think I'm being stupid,

253
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:18,157
letting that invitation
bother me.

254
00:12:18,157 --> 00:12:19,569
You said
it wasn't bothering you,

255
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:20,815
and I was relieved we didn't
have to talk about it.

256
00:12:20,815 --> 00:12:23,059
Why the hell would they
invite me to their wedding?

257
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:24,637
To further humiliate me?

258
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,665
Maybe they're trying
to make amends.
Amends.

259
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,993
By making me
starve myself for a month

260
00:12:30,993 --> 00:12:32,653
so I can fit into
a drop‐dead sexy dress and ‐‐

261
00:12:32,653 --> 00:12:34,607
Hey. Up ahead.

262
00:12:34,607 --> 00:12:35,561
That's the counterfeit guy.

263
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,459
Hey! Hands on the hood.
Let's go.

264
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:44,783
Alright.
Spread your legs apart.

265
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,373
This can't be real.

266
00:13:19,425 --> 00:13:21,876
‐It's the emergency...
‐Look. You think this is real?

267
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,893
What's happening?

268
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,870
Go! Go! Go! Come on!
We got to get out of here!

269
00:13:58,388 --> 00:13:59,842
What do we do?
Let him go.

270
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:01,255
We got to get
back to the station.

271
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,589
Order! Order in my court!

272
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,624
Order! Order!

273
00:14:16,624 --> 00:14:18,868
Everyone, be still!

274
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:21,568
Clearly, we can't continue,
given the missile alert.

275
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:23,436
Deputy, take the prisoners
back to holding.

276
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:25,514
Let's go. Come on.
Screw that.
There's a nuke coming!

277
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:28,629
Got anything?

278
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:29,916
The ‐‐ The lines
are already jammed.

279
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,204
People are panicking.

280
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,700
We got to help them out.
Should we evacuate?

281
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,820
No. No. Um...

282
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:37,726
Hey, hey, everybody.
Excuse me.

283
00:14:37,726 --> 00:14:39,928
Everyone, if I can have
your attention, please.

284
00:14:39,928 --> 00:14:42,793
Uh, I'm Jessica Russo,
Department of Homeland Security.

285
00:14:42,793 --> 00:14:45,036
Now, I haven't gotten
in touch with my office,

286
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:48,193
but there is a good chance
that this is not real.

287
00:14:48,193 --> 00:14:49,481
That's right.
That's right.

288
00:14:49,481 --> 00:14:50,769
There was
a false missile alert

289
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,181
out of Hawaii
just last year.

290
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:54,092
There's no need to panic.

291
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:55,463
What if it's not fake?

292
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:56,792
Well, then you got
about 28 minutes

293
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:58,702
until you find out
what Hell feels like.

294
00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:00,863
Okay, that kind of talk
isn't helping anything.

295
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,352
The DHS has scenarios
planned for this situation.

296
00:15:04,352 --> 00:15:06,138
We have.
Yes, we have.

297
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:10,873
And, um, the most likely target
is downtown.

298
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,448
Where we are.
Okay. Wait!

299
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:14,238
Order.

300
00:15:14,238 --> 00:15:15,858
Wait! Wait!

301
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:18,848
The blast radius is likely
between 10 to 15 miles.

302
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:22,006
And with an impact expected
in 27 minutes,

303
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:25,535
there isn't enough time
to get far enough away,

304
00:15:25,535 --> 00:15:28,111
which is why we need
to get underground.

305
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:29,608
Judge, sir, i‐is ‐‐

306
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:30,935
is there a bomb shelter
in this building?

307
00:15:30,935 --> 00:15:35,339
No, but the holding cells
are downstairs.

308
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:36,918
Let's go.
I hate to break it
to you,

309
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,745
but those cells leak
when it rains.

310
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:41,777
They're not gonna do squat
in a nuclear attack.

311
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:42,898
Okay ‐‐

312
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:43,771
Now. Come on. Let's go.

313
00:15:55,028 --> 00:15:57,106
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

314
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:03,585
Damn it.

315
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,027
Here goes nothing.

316
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:28,757
Listen up.

317
00:16:28,757 --> 00:16:31,874
LAPD has not been able
to verify the alert is real.

318
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:33,368
However, real or not,

319
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,363
everyone in the city
is panicking right now.

320
00:16:35,363 --> 00:16:37,813
So I don't care if you've been
off the street for 20 years.

321
00:16:37,813 --> 00:16:39,764
If you got a badge,
get out there.

322
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:43,379
First priority ‐‐
to secure sensitive targets.

323
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:44,958
Next, protect the community.

324
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,577
Ignore petty crimes.

325
00:16:46,577 --> 00:16:48,197
Focus on people,
not property.

326
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:51,271
Look, I know you're scared.
I'm scared, too.

327
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:52,892
But people out there
are counting on us,

328
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:54,428
and we will help them.

329
00:16:54,428 --> 00:16:55,716
Yeah.

330
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:56,962
Okay, let's get to work.

331
00:17:05,768 --> 00:17:07,680
What can I do?
Stay here.

332
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,717
If this is real,
there's a place to seek shelter

333
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:10,048
in the parking garage.

334
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:11,294
Stay with me.

335
00:17:11,294 --> 00:17:12,913
I can't.

336
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:14,658
I'm the guy
that catches the nuke.

337
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,900
It's actually
a pretty prestigious assignment.

338
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,313
You're an idiot.

339
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:19,642
Thanks.

340
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,410
The world could be ending.

341
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:30,068
I don't think anybody's gonna
begrudge you a little PDA.

342
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:31,647
Come here.

343
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,549
I'll see you later.
You better.

344
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,280
Why is everyone
running around, Mommy?
We're having a drill,

345
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,150
like we were having at school
when I picked you up.

346
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,517
But then why does
everyone look so scared?

347
00:17:46,517 --> 00:17:48,511
Because
they're good actors, baby.

348
00:17:48,511 --> 00:17:50,297
Detective,
why aren't you on the street?

349
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:52,167
'Cause I need to take care
of my daughter.

350
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,770
Understood.

351
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,349
Hi, there.

352
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:01,804
I'm Sergeant Grey.

353
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:03,881
Lila.
Nice to meet you, Lila.

354
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:05,459
Do you mind if I talk
to your mom for a minute?

355
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:07,245
Sure.

356
00:18:07,245 --> 00:18:10,111
Uh, go get a snack
from the machine, baby. Okay?

357
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:11,732
Um, I can help her.

358
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:13,351
Thank you.
Of course.

359
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:17,629
Is it real?

360
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,500
I don't know.

361
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,994
Tell me ‐‐
how was the traffic coming in?

362
00:18:20,994 --> 00:18:22,366
Any chance for people
to get clear?

363
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:25,231
No.

364
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:40,061
Why don't you just
let us go, man?

365
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:41,432
It's the end of the world.

366
00:18:41,432 --> 00:18:42,677
Give us a few minutes
of freedom.

367
00:18:42,677 --> 00:18:44,672
Don't make us die
in these chains.
Shut up, Oscar.

368
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:46,623
You're not getting out
of those cuffs.
We ain't asking.

369
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:49,322
Back up. Back up.
Right now. Right now.

370
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:57,133
Hey, um,
I can't get ahold of Angela.

371
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,670
Can I use your radio?
Yeah.

372
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:01,827
7‐Adam‐07,
go to channel 15.

373
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:03,364
Just turn the dial on top.
Thank you.

374
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,018
Angela, it's me.

375
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:09,969
<i>Wesley?
Hey, how's it going?</i>

376
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:11,962
Oh, you know, pretty good
for the end of the world.

377
00:19:11,962 --> 00:19:13,997
I'm bummed we're gonna miss
our reservation.

378
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:17,238
Look, we're not.
This is just a false alarm.

379
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:18,399
<i>Okay?
Yeah.</i>

380
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,979
Hey. You alright?

381
00:19:19,979 --> 00:19:21,142
There's a bomb shelter
at the public school

382
00:19:21,142 --> 00:19:22,596
two blocks west, alright?
Head there.

383
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:23,926
Where are you?

384
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:25,752
I'm at the courthouse
with Nolan

385
00:19:25,752 --> 00:19:27,081
<i>and Jessica and a bunch
of scared people.</i>

386
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:28,368
Two blocks west.
Head there.

387
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,532
Are you going down
to the bomb shelter?

388
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:33,645
Judge Stevens
said there isn't one.

389
00:19:33,645 --> 00:19:36,885
Criminal courthouse
on Spring?
Yeah.

390
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,422
There's definitely
a fallout shelter.

391
00:19:38,422 --> 00:19:39,792
<i>I was down there once
as a rookie.</i>

392
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:43,656
Hey.

393
00:19:43,656 --> 00:19:45,650
Nolan.

394
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,726
Angela says this place
does have a bomb shelter.

395
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:50,385
Are you safe
where you are?

396
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:55,204
<i>Angela.
Are you still there?</i>

397
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:57,238
Yeah.
I'm heading underground.

398
00:19:59,191 --> 00:20:01,558
Okay. I love you.

399
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:03,095
Love you, too.

400
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:09,742
The judge is gone.

401
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,943
So is the ADA, the ‐‐
the bailiff,

402
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,646
and a bunch of other people
from the gallery.

403
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:17,343
What's happening?

404
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:19,545
The judge lied to us
about the bomb shelter.

405
00:20:25,027 --> 00:20:26,523
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

406
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:27,853
Step back.
What are you doing?

407
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,722
What I have to.

408
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:37,781
‐Back up. I'm closing this door.
‐And what about the rest of us?

409
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:40,107
If she's right about the nuke,
then this is ground zero.

410
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:42,101
Won't be safe
to go outside for weeks.

411
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:44,385
We don't have the supplies
in here for all of you.

412
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:46,587
So you're gonna kill a cop
and all these others

413
00:20:46,587 --> 00:20:47,832
just to save yourselves?

414
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:49,743
And the rest of you ‐‐
you're all good with that?!

415
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:51,197
I'm not gonna
tell you again.

416
00:20:51,197 --> 00:20:53,358
Back up
so I can close this door.

417
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:55,600
Okay. Okay, fine.
You win. I give up.

418
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:59,214
Pretty cool, right?

419
00:20:59,214 --> 00:21:00,917
They taught me that
at the Academy.

420
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,576
Come on.

421
00:21:03,576 --> 00:21:05,154
You're making
a big mistake.

422
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:06,566
And you're under arrest.
Sit down right there.

423
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,062
Get cozy.

424
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:09,806
Here we go.
Come in.

425
00:21:09,806 --> 00:21:11,011
Hands.

426
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,749
No, no, no! Not him!

427
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:16,411
Hey. They're human beings
with rights.

428
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:18,156
He killed our boy
in cold blood.

429
00:21:18,156 --> 00:21:20,814
Aw.
You better back up, mami,

430
00:21:20,814 --> 00:21:22,517
or you'll be next.
You ‐‐

431
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:24,095
‐Get off me!
‐Okay. Alright. Alright.

432
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:25,550
‐Hey. Take it easy.
‐Hey, hey, hey!

433
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,086
Alright, we're not leaving
anyone outside, okay?

434
00:21:27,086 --> 00:21:29,246
So everyone back up.
Here we go. Come on.

435
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,451
Back up.
Let's get these prisoners
over to the back here.

436
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:32,112
We can segregate them
on the benches.

437
00:21:32,112 --> 00:21:34,105
Here. Take that.

438
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:37,263
Folks, in this way.
Keep moving.

439
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,344
Go ahead
and sit down, sir.

440
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:41,957
Is that everyone?
Thank you.

441
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:43,619
Alright.

442
00:21:45,362 --> 00:21:48,022
Be a lot more comfortable
without this chain, you know?

443
00:21:48,022 --> 00:21:50,431
We can keep the cuffs on.
Don't push your luck, Oscar.

444
00:21:50,431 --> 00:21:52,217
Ah, that's all
I know how to do.

445
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:15,396
There's barely any air
moving in here at all.

446
00:22:15,396 --> 00:22:17,224
Well, the judge
was right about one thing.

447
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:18,760
With this many people
in here,

448
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,381
these supplies
won't even last a week.

449
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,790
I'm surprised
we haven't gotten an update.

450
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,243
Control, 7‐Adam‐15.
Come in.

451
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:29,393
Control?

452
00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:31,968
No bars.
Alright.

453
00:22:31,968 --> 00:22:35,334
So, we know radio frequencies
and mobile signals

454
00:22:35,334 --> 00:22:36,663
are blocked by the shelter.

455
00:22:36,663 --> 00:22:38,616
Let's hope it does as well
against radiation.

456
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:49,292
This thing hasn't worked
since the Reagan administration.

457
00:22:52,116 --> 00:22:54,026
So, now all we can do
is wait.

458
00:22:59,841 --> 00:23:01,379
13 minutes.

459
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,667
Stop checking the time.

460
00:23:02,667 --> 00:23:04,203
Are you serious?

461
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:05,740
We're about to be burned up
by a giant fireball.

462
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,485
"A," no, we're not.
It's a false alarm.

463
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:08,980
And, "B,"
counting down the minutes

464
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,140
wouldn't accomplish anything,
even if it was real.

465
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,424
So, what, you just want me
to think about something else?

466
00:23:13,424 --> 00:23:15,002
Pretty much.
Can't be done.

467
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,290
Really?

468
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:19,779
Okay.

469
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:20,860
How would you sabotage
that wedding?

470
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,688
What?

471
00:23:22,688 --> 00:23:24,184
Don't tell me you didn't
lie awake all night

472
00:23:24,184 --> 00:23:26,800
fantasizing about it.
I ‐‐ I didn't.

473
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,790
Lying to me in your last moments
on Earth is a bad look.

474
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,702
You said
it was a false alarm.

475
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:33,280
Fine.

476
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,606
I'd cancel
the rehearsal dinner,

477
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:37,766
change the registry
to a bondage Web store,

478
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:40,050
pay a gang of clowns
to storm their wedding,

479
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:43,166
and hire a chopper to fly over
their outdoor reception,

480
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,578
see how well
their wedding cake stands up

481
00:23:44,578 --> 00:23:46,947
to the rotor wash of
a Sikorsky helicopter.

482
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:48,026
Didn't think about it,
huh?

483
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:52,055
How is revenge what
we're focusing on right now?

484
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:55,294
It's tangible, okay?
You can hold on to it.

485
00:23:55,294 --> 00:23:57,913
Imminent nuclear death
is totally unrelatable.

486
00:23:57,913 --> 00:23:59,449
Now, speaking of revenge,

487
00:23:59,449 --> 00:24:01,941
I have a friend at USC
who studies cockroaches.

488
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,520
I'm sure he could
loan you a few hundred

489
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,767
to release
at the wedding.

490
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:18,100
Mommy,
what's really going on?

491
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,803
I told you, honey.
It's a drill.

492
00:24:19,803 --> 00:24:22,669
Please don't lie.

493
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,036
Daddy says that's why
we can't see you anymore.

494
00:24:25,036 --> 00:24:28,111
Don't you want
to tell the truth?

495
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,763
Of course I do, honey.
I ‐‐

496
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:35,338
I just ‐‐

497
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:38,786
My previous job,
I had to lie a lot...

498
00:24:38,786 --> 00:24:40,863
to fool criminals, so...

499
00:24:40,863 --> 00:24:42,441
Why do you want
to fool me?

500
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:43,896
Are you mad at me?

501
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:45,141
Of course not.
No, honey.

502
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:48,008
I, um ‐‐ I love you.

503
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,372
I'll make you a deal.

504
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:53,241
I'll stop sleeping
with a night light

505
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:55,817
if you tell the truth,
okay?

506
00:24:55,817 --> 00:24:57,105
Okay.

507
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,504
And here I thought the most
stressful part of my day

508
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:30,584
would be going to court.

509
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:32,245
At least we're together.

510
00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:34,199
Yeah.

511
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:38,561
Thank you for coming
to support me.

512
00:25:38,561 --> 00:25:40,014
You're welcome.

513
00:25:46,784 --> 00:25:49,194
Can I, um ‐‐

514
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:50,813
Can I confess something?

515
00:25:50,813 --> 00:25:52,684
You were already here
for a meeting.

516
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:53,971
You knew?

517
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:55,341
Yeah,
but it didn't matter.

518
00:26:02,277 --> 00:26:03,980
10 minutes.

519
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,518
We still have time to get
to the fallout shelter

520
00:26:05,518 --> 00:26:07,803
at the courthouse,
hook up with Wesley.

521
00:26:07,803 --> 00:26:10,379
Yeah, maybe we should,
just to be safe.

522
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:12,704
All hail
Children of the Stars.

523
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,446
The worthy will
ascend into the heavens!

524
00:26:15,446 --> 00:26:18,022
All hail
Children of the Stars.
We are not going
to the shelter, are we?

525
00:26:18,022 --> 00:26:20,182
We will wait for your
arrival, Noon Star Harvesters.

526
00:26:20,182 --> 00:26:21,178
All hail
Children of the Stars.

527
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:27,700
Today the saviors
will gather our souls.

528
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,527
All hail
Children of the Stars.

529
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:32,020
The worthy
will ascend into the heavens.

530
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,302
All hail
Children of the Stars.
Hey!

531
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,004
We await your arrival...
How about you come down
from there?

532
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:38,499
...Noon Star Harvesters.

533
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:40,202
All hail
Children of the Stars.
No.

534
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:41,823
It's almost our time,
but there's nothing to fear.

535
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:43,194
This was all prophesized ‐‐

536
00:26:43,194 --> 00:26:44,356
"Like a clarion call,

537
00:26:44,356 --> 00:26:46,184
word shall spread
of Our Saviors From Above.

538
00:26:46,184 --> 00:26:47,762
Heed ye
the Noon Star Harvesters,

539
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:49,590
for they shall descend
from the heavens

540
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,044
so The Worthy
can ascend."

541
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:53,537
So sayeth
The Prophet Jedediah.

542
00:26:53,537 --> 00:26:56,029
All hail
Children of the Stars.

543
00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:58,811
Okay. So, you're saying
the missile ‐‐
Isn't a missile.

544
00:26:58,811 --> 00:27:00,847
It is a cloak behind which
our saviors will come to us,

545
00:27:00,847 --> 00:27:03,216
and we will step out to meet
them at the appointed time,

546
00:27:03,216 --> 00:27:05,624
ascending into
their interstellar embrace.

547
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:09,030
All hail
Children of the Stars.

548
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:11,814
Today the Saviors will...

549
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:14,015
So, they're clearly crazy.
Can we go now?

550
00:27:14,015 --> 00:27:16,424
All hail
Children of the Stars.
You can.

551
00:27:16,424 --> 00:27:18,916
But I'm not leaving until I get
them down off that ledge.

552
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:20,869
All hail
Children of the Stars.
Yeah, but if the missile's real,
it won't matter if they jump.

553
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:22,489
And if it's not?

554
00:27:22,489 --> 00:27:25,106
We wait for your arrival,
Noon Star Harvesters.

555
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:27,971
All hail
Children of the Stars.

556
00:27:27,971 --> 00:27:29,634
Today the Saviors
will gather our souls.
Okay.

557
00:27:29,634 --> 00:27:31,585
I mean, but they're
true believers.

558
00:27:31,585 --> 00:27:34,119
How are we gonna get through
to them in nine minutes?

559
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,864
I'm open to suggestions.

560
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,439
All hail
Children of the Stars.

561
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:39,603
Get out of here!

562
00:27:39,603 --> 00:27:41,139
Put ‐‐ Put it down!

563
00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:42,344
Get ‐‐ Get out! Get out!

564
00:27:42,344 --> 00:27:43,964
Put it down! Put it down!

565
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,238
Amari, it's Tim!
Bradford?!

566
00:27:49,238 --> 00:27:51,524
Yeah. You alright?

567
00:27:51,524 --> 00:27:53,726
Yeah, but Lewis took a bottle
to the head.

568
00:27:53,726 --> 00:27:55,428
Alright,
just put down the shotgun.

569
00:27:55,428 --> 00:27:57,465
They're robbing me.
I got to protect my store.

570
00:27:57,465 --> 00:27:59,541
We're here now,
so put it down.

571
00:28:01,078 --> 00:28:02,159
Put it on the counter.
Put it down.

572
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,902
Okay.
O‐Okay. Alright.

573
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:06,727
Now we're coming in.

574
00:28:07,682 --> 00:28:08,804
Check him out.

575
00:28:10,548 --> 00:28:13,207
Hey. Let me see.
Ohh.

576
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:14,411
Okay, you're gonna need
stitches,

577
00:28:14,411 --> 00:28:15,865
but it's nothing
life‐threatening.

578
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:17,195
Keep pressure on it.

579
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,565
Why don't you take him around
the corner to your house?

580
00:28:18,565 --> 00:28:20,268
No, I‐I‐I can't leave
my store.

581
00:28:20,268 --> 00:28:22,137
It's just stuff, Amari.
The missile is coming, alright?

582
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:23,510
You should be
with your family.

583
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,378
Yeah, but if it's not,
I'll lose everything.

584
00:28:25,378 --> 00:28:26,666
No wonder you need counseling.

585
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:28,078
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

586
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:29,573
It means that nothing
is more important

587
00:28:29,573 --> 00:28:31,442
than the people you love,
and they need you right now.

588
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:34,890
We'll take care of
your shop.

589
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:37,964
O‐Okay.

590
00:28:37,964 --> 00:28:39,542
Alright, come on.
Let's get him up.
Okay.

591
00:28:39,542 --> 00:28:42,408
You're right.
You're right.

592
00:28:42,408 --> 00:28:44,320
Thank you.
Let's go. Come on.

593
00:28:49,055 --> 00:28:51,089
Busted.

594
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:52,876
How much time
we got left?

595
00:28:56,033 --> 00:28:57,320
Enough.

596
00:29:01,849 --> 00:29:05,213
Uh, I'm not
a whiskey girl.

597
00:29:10,738 --> 00:29:12,690
To the end of the world.

598
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,476
Whenever that may be.

599
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,416
This shelter
was built in the '50s.

600
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:23,448
Now, nukes are 10 times
as powerful today.

601
00:29:23,448 --> 00:29:26,730
Odds are good that this building
collapses when the blast hits.

602
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,728
Shut up, Oscar.

603
00:29:27,728 --> 00:29:29,554
It's basic science, my man.

604
00:29:29,554 --> 00:29:31,091
Try not to sound
so happy about it.

605
00:29:31,091 --> 00:29:32,255
What can I say?
I'm a happy guy.

606
00:29:32,255 --> 00:29:34,539
Not like mami over here.

607
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,324
So sad.

608
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:38,112
Don't you laugh
at our grief.

609
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:40,354
He's trying to provoke you.
Don't let him.

610
00:29:40,354 --> 00:29:42,473
You got me
all wrong, Counselor.

611
00:29:42,473 --> 00:29:45,714
What we have here is
a cathartic opportunity.

612
00:29:45,714 --> 00:29:49,701
Two paths ‐‐
forgiveness or revenge.

613
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:51,902
Oh, three, three paths.

614
00:29:51,902 --> 00:29:54,685
I forgot.
I forgot about the missile.

615
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:56,805
Oh, I ain't looking
for forgiveness.

616
00:29:56,805 --> 00:29:58,465
And little papi over there

617
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,833
can try for revenge
if he likes.

618
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:02,743
But he'll just end up
in the ground like his kid.

619
00:30:02,743 --> 00:30:03,574
You ‐‐

620
00:30:03,574 --> 00:30:04,903
Come here!

621
00:30:06,274 --> 00:30:07,355
How dare you!

622
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:08,392
Sit down. Shut up.

623
00:30:08,392 --> 00:30:10,553
Sit down now.
Sit down.

624
00:30:10,553 --> 00:30:12,007
It's okay.
He's not worth it.

625
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:13,377
One more word
out of any of them,

626
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:14,417
we're gagging them all.
Happy to.

627
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:16,201
One more word.

628
00:30:18,777 --> 00:30:20,606
You okay?

629
00:30:20,606 --> 00:30:22,764
No.

630
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:35,643
Today the Saviors
will gather our souls.

631
00:30:35,643 --> 00:30:37,926
All hail
Children of the Stars.

632
00:30:37,926 --> 00:30:40,170
The worthy will ascend
into the heavens.

633
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,250
All hail
Children of the Stars.
Excuse me.

634
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,496
I hate to interrupt.

635
00:30:42,496 --> 00:30:44,075
I just have a question.

636
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,902
The time
for questions is done.

637
00:30:45,902 --> 00:30:48,102
Totally. I just ‐‐

638
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,095
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Hold on.

639
00:30:51,095 --> 00:30:52,548
Hold on.
Who's Jedediah?

640
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:53,794
You mentioned him earlier.

641
00:30:53,794 --> 00:30:54,958
He is the prophet

642
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:57,575
who helped us cast away
our earthly possessions

643
00:30:57,575 --> 00:30:58,530
and see the truth.

644
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:03,598
About the aliens?

645
00:31:03,598 --> 00:31:05,217
They're not aliens.

646
00:31:05,217 --> 00:31:07,626
They're spirits
from another universe.

647
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:10,077
And where is he?
Jedediah.

648
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:11,698
He's joining us
in the heavens.

649
00:31:11,698 --> 00:31:12,944
Does that mean
he's on another rooftop?

650
00:31:12,944 --> 00:31:14,480
No.
This is the one true spot,

651
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,059
where ‐‐ where the chosen
will ascend.

652
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:17,886
And yet he's not here.

653
00:31:19,424 --> 00:31:21,542
What's your name?

654
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:23,786
Aurora.

655
00:31:23,786 --> 00:31:25,115
How old are you, Aurora?

656
00:31:25,115 --> 00:31:28,312
19.

657
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:29,558
It is
the age of the chosen.

658
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:31,552
Aren't you scared?

659
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:32,924
No, I'm at peace.
It's just...

660
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,410
...I don't like heights.

661
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,527
I don't blame you.
It's a long way down.

662
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:42,353
So why do you have to step
off the roof to ascend?

663
00:31:44,472 --> 00:31:46,465
'Cause that's the way
it must be.
Why?

664
00:31:46,465 --> 00:31:48,751
The spirits love you.
Oh, yes.

665
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:50,494
And they're traveling
all this way to save you.

666
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:52,239
Do you think they really care
how you meet them,

667
00:31:52,239 --> 00:31:54,689
as long as you do it
with open arms?

668
00:31:58,553 --> 00:32:00,629
It is a test to our faith.

669
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:02,998
There is no doubt
you have faith, all of you.

670
00:32:02,998 --> 00:32:05,116
So come down now,

671
00:32:05,116 --> 00:32:07,732
and we'll wait for them together
on solid ground.

672
00:32:12,135 --> 00:32:13,465
I promise it'll be okay.

673
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,626
<i>Attention, all units.</i>

674
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:30,994
<i>Missile alert is a false alarm.</i>

675
00:32:30,994 --> 00:32:32,239
<i>I repeat ‐‐ the alert
is a false alarm.
Oh, thank God.</i>

676
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:33,694
What does ‐‐
What does that mean?

677
00:32:33,694 --> 00:32:34,774
It means
they're not coming.

678
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:43,330
The danger's over.
Okay?

679
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,743
Okay.

680
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:46,115
Does that mean
Daddy'll be here soon?

681
00:32:48,938 --> 00:32:51,265
Yeah. Yeah.
I know, right?

682
00:32:51,265 --> 00:32:53,467
‐Crazy today.
‐This was unbelievable.

683
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:54,754
Oh, you know what?

684
00:32:54,754 --> 00:32:56,997
Honey,
I will be right back.

685
00:32:56,997 --> 00:32:59,032
Hey. Hi.

686
00:32:59,032 --> 00:33:01,941
Um  thanks
for watching my kid.

687
00:33:01,941 --> 00:33:03,021
Oh, my pleasure.

688
00:33:03,021 --> 00:33:04,184
She's super cute.

689
00:33:04,184 --> 00:33:05,097
Thanks.

690
00:33:05,097 --> 00:33:06,510
Uh, hey, listen.

691
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,835
You work for Social Services,
right?

692
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:10,123
I do.

693
00:33:10,123 --> 00:33:12,158
Can I ask you
a theoretical question?

694
00:33:12,158 --> 00:33:13,737
Sure.

695
00:33:13,737 --> 00:33:16,395
Okay, say, uh,
there's a divorced couple

696
00:33:16,395 --> 00:33:18,390
and, uh, the dad
has sole custody

697
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:20,674
and the mom
has supervised visitations

698
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:23,291
and an emergency comes up

699
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,992
and she can't
get in touch with him ‐‐

700
00:33:25,992 --> 00:33:29,231
So she picks her super cute
daughter up from school

701
00:33:29,231 --> 00:33:30,393
to keep her safe.

702
00:33:30,393 --> 00:33:31,931
Yeah.

703
00:33:31,931 --> 00:33:33,551
Is that bad?

704
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:37,705
To the court,
it's not good.

705
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:41,360
You know that technically
it's a parental abduction.

706
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,397
Yeah, but even given
the circumstances?

707
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:46,261
I'm not saying a judge wouldn't
take it into consideration,

708
00:33:46,261 --> 00:33:49,418
but if the factors that led
to the visitation restrictions

709
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:50,581
are serious enough,

710
00:33:50,581 --> 00:33:52,368
it won't matter.

711
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:56,190
You could lose
all access to her.

712
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,351
Harper,
have you heard from Nolan?

713
00:33:58,351 --> 00:33:59,928
He's the only cop
that hasn't checked in.

714
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:01,423
What?

715
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:02,877
Officer Nolan.
Your rookie?

716
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:03,957
Have you heard from him?

717
00:34:06,034 --> 00:34:08,859
No, sir, I‐I haven't talked
to him since this morning.

718
00:34:17,082 --> 00:34:18,370
One minute.

719
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,525
Will we know
when it hits?

720
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:25,723
Yeah. We'll feel the shock wave
and likely some heat.

721
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:26,886
Hopefully
not too much heat.

722
00:34:35,194 --> 00:34:37,063
30 seconds.

723
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:16,275
Ohh!

724
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:19,059
Prisoner secured!

725
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:20,471
Nolan.

726
00:35:22,964 --> 00:35:25,039
Everybody, be calm.

727
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,401
Thanks for the diversion,
buddy.

728
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:31,146
Let the judge go.
Sure I will,

729
00:35:31,146 --> 00:35:32,767
just as soon as
I'm outside.

730
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:34,262
What about the missile?
Well, if it's real,

731
00:35:34,262 --> 00:35:35,673
I'm not gonna
feel it anyways.

732
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:37,294
I'm just gonna wink
right out of existence.

733
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:39,205
I don't want to spend the rest
of my days in solitary.

734
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:41,905
If you even twitch,
I'm gonna cut your carotid.

735
00:35:46,142 --> 00:35:48,011
No! Don't open it!

736
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,274
Hey.

737
00:35:57,274 --> 00:35:58,893
Ugh!

738
00:36:01,053 --> 00:36:03,048
Looks like you'll be spending
some time in solitary after all.

739
00:36:04,254 --> 00:36:06,662
So, no missile?
False alarm.

740
00:36:06,662 --> 00:36:08,780
Heat wave caused a malfunction
at Edwards Air Force Base.

741
00:36:12,975 --> 00:36:14,596
Where's Wesley?

742
00:36:14,596 --> 00:36:16,630
I don't know.
He was just here.

743
00:36:29,715 --> 00:36:31,377
Wesley.

744
00:36:33,578 --> 00:36:35,073
Oh, my God.

745
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:36,570
Get an ambulance!

746
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,563
Oh, my God.
It's okay, baby.

747
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:40,723
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

748
00:36:45,084 --> 00:36:47,536
35‐year‐old male
in hypovolemic shock,

749
00:36:47,536 --> 00:36:49,903
stab wound to the left chest,
possible pneumothorax.

750
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:53,766
Alert the O. R.
This guy's jumping the line.

751
00:36:53,766 --> 00:36:55,677
We've got him from here.
Is he gonna be okay?

752
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:57,463
It depends on the extent
of the internal damage,

753
00:36:57,463 --> 00:36:58,792
but we're gonna do
everything we can.

754
00:36:58,792 --> 00:36:59,914
Sorry. I've gotta go.

755
00:37:07,847 --> 00:37:09,883
You can't really
blame a guy for trying.

756
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:11,088
To commit a felony?

757
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:13,040
It's literally what I do
for a living.

758
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,159
Was it all
just a game to you?

759
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,277
Did you feel any fear
at all?

760
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,481
Honestly? No.

761
00:37:19,603 --> 00:37:21,057
Guys like me
are wired differently.

762
00:37:21,057 --> 00:37:24,255
I don't really do fear
or anxiety.

763
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,332
On the flip side,
I have really poor
impulse control.

764
00:37:26,332 --> 00:37:28,325
He, you think
I could get a soda?

765
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:30,113
No.
Is my daughter here?

766
00:37:30,113 --> 00:37:33,976
Where's my daughter?
Where is she? Lila!

767
00:37:33,976 --> 00:37:35,885
What's going on?
My daughter ‐‐ Lila.

768
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:36,841
Please tell me
she's here.

769
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:37,963
Daddy!

770
00:37:37,963 --> 00:37:39,251
Oh, God.

771
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:43,321
Are you okay, baby?
Yeah.

772
00:37:43,321 --> 00:37:45,067
Mommy picked me up at school
'cause of the missile,

773
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:46,520
but it's not real.

774
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,849
I‐I was trying to get
in touch with you ‐‐

775
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:48,970
You had no right!

776
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,923
I showed up,
and she was gone.

777
00:37:50,923 --> 00:37:53,248
The school was closed.
I had no idea where she was!

778
00:37:53,248 --> 00:37:55,202
Sir, I understand your fear,
but your child was safe here.

779
00:37:55,202 --> 00:37:56,614
Y‐You don't understand.

780
00:37:56,614 --> 00:37:59,190
She has no custody rights.
She kidnapped my kid.

781
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,099
I did not ‐‐
No, no, no, no.
I want her arrested.

782
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:04,672
Daddy, no.

783
00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:07,538
Sir, with all due respect,
I think you're overreacting.

784
00:38:07,538 --> 00:38:09,823
I'm what?
When you consider
everything that happened ‐‐

785
00:38:09,823 --> 00:38:11,609
I‐I don't care.
This is the last straw.

786
00:38:11,609 --> 00:38:13,437
She said things had changed,
that she had changed,

787
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:15,265
but it was just another lie.
No, it wasn't.

788
00:38:16,718 --> 00:38:18,047
How the hell
would you know?

789
00:38:18,047 --> 00:38:20,208
Because she's here,

790
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,574
back in uniform,
training me.

791
00:38:22,574 --> 00:38:24,983
I couldn't figure out why
until just this moment.

792
00:38:24,983 --> 00:38:26,729
I mean,
she had a golden ticket.

793
00:38:26,729 --> 00:38:28,349
She could have gone anywhere
in the department,

794
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:29,844
anywhere she wanted.

795
00:38:29,844 --> 00:38:31,590
So, why the hell
would she get back in blues

796
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,250
and spend her days
training a guy like me?

797
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:37,197
I knew whatever the reason was,
it had to be primal,

798
00:38:37,197 --> 00:38:40,769
powerful enough to...overcome
her inherent arrogance.

799
00:38:42,846 --> 00:38:46,751
And now I see your daughter,
and I see exactly why

800
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:48,910
she's willing to sacrifice
what she does best

801
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,278
for the person
she loves the most.

802
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:53,231
Please, Daddy.

803
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,391
I made her promise ‐‐
no more lying.

804
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:59,545
It's true.

805
00:39:03,076 --> 00:39:04,653
I'm trying here, Don.

806
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:07,312
I have been lost,

807
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:10,760
and I am trying
to find my way back.

808
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,089
And I am gonna make
mistakes.

809
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:15,328
And I'm gonna
fall on my face a lot.

810
00:39:15,328 --> 00:39:16,950
But when that alert
came in,

811
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:18,942
the only thing
I could think about

812
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:20,937
was making sure
that she was safe.

813
00:39:20,937 --> 00:39:23,429
That is the only thing
that matters to me now.

814
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,145
Okay.

815
00:39:34,145 --> 00:39:36,888
Okay.

816
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:38,383
Let's go home.

817
00:39:44,114 --> 00:39:48,352
Go hug your mama.

818
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:02,932

I'm fine.

832
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,373
What's taking so long?

833
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:37,201
So, do you want me
to talk to my buddy

834
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,613
about the cockroaches?

835
00:40:38,613 --> 00:40:40,773
No, thanks.

836
00:40:40,773 --> 00:40:43,224
After today, I've decided that
I'm okay with the wedding.

837
00:40:43,224 --> 00:40:45,218
I know they seem
really happy.

838
00:40:45,218 --> 00:40:46,837
And truth be told,
I was only with him

839
00:40:46,837 --> 00:40:48,458
because I couldn't afford
to move out.

840
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,327
And she knew that, so...

841
00:40:50,327 --> 00:40:52,320
Does that mean
we're going to the wedding?

842
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,934
No, but I might
get them a present.

843
00:40:55,934 --> 00:40:58,095
With a roach in it?
Maybe.

844
00:40:58,095 --> 00:41:00,753
You are a bad influence.

845
00:41:00,753 --> 00:41:02,748
Love you, too. Bye.

846
00:41:02,748 --> 00:41:05,364
So, Henry says hello

847
00:41:05,364 --> 00:41:08,313
and that I should move
the hell out of Los Angeles.

848
00:41:08,313 --> 00:41:10,058
That's a smart kid.
What'd you tell him?

849
00:41:10,058 --> 00:41:11,678
That there was never
any real danger

850
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,966
because you had my back.

851
00:41:12,966 --> 00:41:14,295
And your front.

852
00:41:17,742 --> 00:41:19,571
Hey.
Hey.

853
00:41:19,571 --> 00:41:20,898
I hope it's okay
that I'm here.

854
00:41:20,898 --> 00:41:22,519
Yeah.

855
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,765
How's Wesley?

856
00:41:23,765 --> 00:41:25,468
We're waiting to find out.
Join us.

857
00:41:30,578 --> 00:41:32,197
Is he okay?

858
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:33,195
The surgery went well.

859
00:41:33,195 --> 00:41:34,774
The doctor repaired
his lung.

860
00:41:34,774 --> 00:41:36,809
As long as there are
no complications,

861
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:39,509
he should make
a full recovery.
Thank you.

862
00:41:39,509 --> 00:41:41,294
They'll move him into ICU
in a few hours.

863
00:41:41,294 --> 00:41:42,915
I'll come get you
so you can see him.

864
00:41:45,989 --> 00:41:47,525
He's gonna be okay.
