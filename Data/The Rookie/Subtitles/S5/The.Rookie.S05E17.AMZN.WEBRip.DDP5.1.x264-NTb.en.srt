1
00:00:00,724 --> 00:00:01,794
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

2
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:03,694
I tried to lock you up,
but I failed.

3
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:05,043
So, what,
you're giving up?

4
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:06,939
Mr. Evers, Charlie Bristow
from X-Ring Security.

5
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:08,457
I never run from a fight.

6
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:10,216
You won't
even see it coming.

7
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:11,797
Ms. Stevens, we have a warrant
for your arrest.

8
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,674
My sister's murder. Celina.

9
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:15,048
I just want to see
if they've really done

10
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,019
everything they can
to find the guy.

11
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,847
There's no card, but it's
clearly from Elijah Stone.

12
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,824
[Banging on door]

13
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,155
Coming.

14
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:30,721
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's wrong?

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,520
I read
my sister's case file.

16
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:33,895
My mom lied to me.

17
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:41,658
The day
my sister was taken,

18
00:00:41,662 --> 00:00:44,252
my mom had a headache
and we were being,

19
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,841
you know,
just noisy kids.

20
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,698
So she sent us
outside to play

21
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:50,262
while she went inside
to lie down.

22
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:52,667
We were out there for
about an hour or so

23
00:00:52,673 --> 00:00:56,063
before I got distracted
and Blanca disappeared.

24
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,706
I was frantic, running around
the block, looking for her.

25
00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:00,783
And when
I finally ran home,

26
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:03,624
my mom was coming
up the street.

27
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:05,925
I thought she had just
come out of the house.

28
00:01:05,927 --> 00:01:08,097
Which is what she told
responding officers.

29
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:09,832
But later she admitted
to the detective

30
00:01:09,828 --> 00:01:11,758
that she had run out
to the store

31
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:14,901
and... and a friend she had met
there corroborated it.

32
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:16,522
A-A friend I've never
even heard of before.

33
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:17,944
Sounds innocent enough.

34
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:18,909
Maybe she just went
to grab some Advil

35
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:20,076
or something
for dinner?

36
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,530
Well, then why lie
about it?

37
00:01:21,529 --> 00:01:23,529
I bet she was afraid
she'd get in trouble

38
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:25,741
for leaving two young kids alone.

39
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,290
And then
the worst happened.

40
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:30,924
Why stick to the "I was home
the whole time" version with me?

41
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:33,268
I wasn't gonna rat her out
to CPS.

42
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:36,815
Look, I am sure there are
a dozen innocent explanations

43
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,510
for every untoward one
you're imagining.

44
00:01:38,512 --> 00:01:41,452
Maybe.

45
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:43,616
If it wasn't my mom,

46
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,140
if it was just some
random witness lying to you,

47
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,871
what would you think?

48
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:50,767
I would think...

49
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:53,215
"What else
is she lying about?"

50
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:55,736
Monica: You'd think
I'd get tired of winning.

51
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:57,596
You know,
I almost feel bad

52
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,910
beating you guys
in court. Again.

53
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:02,812
- No, you don't.
- You're right. I don't.

54
00:02:02,812 --> 00:02:05,092
What was the most
impressive part of my defense?

55
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,130
Gotta be when I pointed out
the recent changes

56
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,467
in the judge's handwriting
made it impossible to know

57
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:11,584
for sure that those
were actually his words.

58
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:14,099
Somehow you knew he had
early-onset dementia,

59
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:15,999
a condition that clearly
affected his handwriting.

60
00:02:15,997 --> 00:02:18,657
Did I? Hmm, maybe he
shared that.
[Scoffs]

61
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:20,585
But the loss of
his mental faculties

62
00:02:20,588 --> 00:02:22,178
certainly didn't
help your case,

63
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,136
which is why you didn't
argue it in court.

64
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,874
It really
doesn't bother you

65
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:27,459
that he's dead
because of you?

66
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:29,177
There is no evidence
that Judge Rivas

67
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:31,363
died of anything other than
a heart attack.

68
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:33,638
And if I hear that you
or your office

69
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:35,046
is saying
anything different,

70
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:38,501
I will sue you and the city
for defamation and win.

71
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,093
Now,
if you'll excuse me,

72
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,510
I have a client's deposition
to get to.

73
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:44,297
Sgt. Grey:
I'll keep it short.

74
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:47,312
This unholy team-up between
Elijah's organization

75
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:50,265
and Abril's has had real-world
effects on our streets.

76
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:51,793
Yeah, last night,
there was an incident

77
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,032
at a cookhouse
in Vernon.

78
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,624
Seven dead inside

79
00:02:54,622 --> 00:02:56,492
and a 10-year-old neighbor
caught a stray bullet.

80
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:58,966
The child is out of surgery,
but it's still touch-and-go.

81
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:00,041
We started a collection
in the break room

82
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,041
if you'd
like to contribute.

83
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:03,562
We need to clamp down.

84
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:06,812
Let's start making their costs
of doing business untenable.

85
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:08,117
Hit up your C.I.s.

86
00:03:08,118 --> 00:03:11,738
Word is, Elijah is orchestrating
a large buy.

87
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:13,023
We can't allow that
to happen.

88
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,470
Alright, be safe out there.

89
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:21,511
Sir, you remember
I let Celina

90
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,551
take a look at her sister's
case file.

91
00:03:23,548 --> 00:03:24,828
And I told you
that could get tricky.

92
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,895
You did, and it is.

93
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:28,896
But she did manage to find
a discrepancy in the report

94
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:30,488
I think bears
looking into.

95
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:31,826
Maybe speak
with a witness.

96
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:34,012
[Sighs]

97
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,866
Okay, just give
the cold-case detective

98
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,320
working the file
a heads-up.

99
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Yes, sir.

100
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,561
And keep an eye on her.

101
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:41,014
Last thing we want
is her to compromise

102
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,263
her sister's murder investigation.

103
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,046
Of course.

104
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:48,328
Hi.
Uh, don't hate me.

105
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:49,711
What did you do?

106
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:51,092
No, you're
supposed to say,

107
00:03:51,092 --> 00:03:52,852
"I could never hate you."

108
00:03:52,853 --> 00:03:54,413
[Sighs] Fine.

109
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:55,856
I got mad at you
a few months back

110
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:57,096
after a Tim Test.

111
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:58,098
Which one?

112
00:03:58,099 --> 00:03:59,859
The... Oh, weird.

113
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,380
I honestly
don't remember.

114
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,209
But so,
that's not important.

115
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:05,968
What did you do?

116
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:08,039
I signed you up to be
a "Make a Dream" mentor,

117
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,110
and then I totally forgot
about it.

118
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm sorry.

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,040
For when?
Today.

120
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,634
12-year-old cancer patient
Jordy Yates

121
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:16,263
is on his way right now.

122
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,766
[Groans]
What?

123
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:19,474
I...
C... It's a good thing.

124
00:04:19,466 --> 00:04:21,946
Lifting up a sick kid
who's having a really hard time.

125
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:23,921
What could you possibly
be doing with your day

126
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:25,608
that would be more important
than that?

127
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,090
Nice job boxing me in.

128
00:04:27,094 --> 00:04:28,894
Thank you.

129
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:30,479
- Where are you going?
- I got to go on patrol.

130
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:31,957
No, no, you and I
are gonna be entertaining

131
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:33,581
our "Make a Dream" kid
together.

132
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,483
[Sighs]
No. What else
could you possibly

133
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:36,762
do with your day
that's more important?

134
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,589
Right. Yep.

135
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:39,968
I should have seen
that coming.

136
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,080
Hey, there.

137
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:45,936
We are not going on patrol
this morning.

138
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,730
There's someone
coming to the station

139
00:04:46,734 --> 00:04:47,914
that we need to talk to.

140
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:49,598
You got my mother
to leave the house?

141
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:51,079
No, and you will not
be the first person

142
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,083
to ask her about these...

143
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,094
Lies.

144
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,215
Discrepancies.

145
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:55,814
She needs to be questioned

146
00:04:55,812 --> 00:04:57,952
by the detective
working the case, okay?

147
00:04:57,952 --> 00:04:59,852
It's important she's not
prepared the first time

148
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:01,441
she's confronted
with this on record.

149
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:02,679
I know you
already know this.

150
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:05,271
I do.
So, who are we talking to?

151
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,240
The mystery man she says
she ran into at the store...

152
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:08,617
Edwin Guzman.
That's great.

153
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:11,138
I-I already have, uh,
a list of questions.

154
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:12,858
Um, "How did you
know my mom?

155
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:15,114
Were you having an affair?
Did you lie for her?

156
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,247
Do you know why my mom lied
to me for my entire life?"

157
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:18,587
Okay, whoa, whoa.

158
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:20,154
I think it's important

159
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:21,417
that I be the one
doing the questioning.

160
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:22,674
But I can be there?

161
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,317
Yes, as a fly
on the wall.

162
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:30,088
Thank you.
Let's go.

163
00:05:30,088 --> 00:05:31,368
[Elevator bell dings]

164
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:33,365
Hi, Mr. Yates.
I'm Lucy Chen.

165
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,677
This is
Sergeant Tim Bradford.

166
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:36,269
Thank you so much
for doing this.

167
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:38,606
This is my son, Jordy.
Say hi.

168
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:40,893
Hi.

169
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:41,892
Hear you
wanna be a cop.

170
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:44,343
- [Chuckles]
- Yeah.

171
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,074
Okay, well, you're gonna be
hanging with us today.

172
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:47,729
So, I just... I come back
to pick him up at 3:00?

173
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,276
- Yeah.
- We'll take
good care of him.

174
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,699
Alright, be good.

175
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:51,625
[Elevator bell dings]
Alright, buddy?

176

You got any
revenge stories?
