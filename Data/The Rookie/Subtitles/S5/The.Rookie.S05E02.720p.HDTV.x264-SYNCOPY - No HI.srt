2
00:00:03,177 --> 00:00:05,102
- Any other plans?
- I have to sell our dad's house.

3
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:07,062
We could make some money
if we put in a little effort.

4
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:08,563
Chief of Police
gave me a Golden Ticket.

5
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:10,288
I can pick any job I want.

6
00:00:10,374 --> 00:00:12,298
- What are you gonna pick?
- He's gonna pick something lame.

7
00:00:12,381 --> 00:00:13,907
- Training officer.
- I knew it.

8
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:15,993
Did I hear you're joining
the D.A.'s office?

9
00:00:16,077 --> 00:00:17,617
- Next week.
- Do you want to come in?

10
00:00:17,702 --> 00:00:20,617
I just wanted to make sure
someone checked on Lucy.

11
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,295
- He still has a pulse.
- What have you done?

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,492
Oh, don't trip
on the mat.

13
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:28,928
Rosalind cut my wrists,
not my ankles.

14
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,696
You just got out
of the hospital.

15
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,445
How tragic would it be
if my chic, yet affordable

16
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,250
welcome mat
sent you right back?

17
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:37,799
You know you're cute
when you worry.

18
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:39,265
I am cute always.

19
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,561
That's true.

20
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:42,686
Ooh.
New sofa.

21
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:47,000
Yeah. You kind of ruined
the last one with all the...

22
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:48,606
All the bleeding.

23
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:50,200
Hey, it's okay.

24
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:52,270
- No, it's not.
- It's what we make it.

25
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:55,338
And I say, let's make the most
of your day off

26
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:56,924
and cuddle up on the couch

27
00:00:57,009 --> 00:00:59,354
to binge the crap out of
something mindless.

28
00:00:59,847 --> 00:01:01,042
Deal?

29
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,314
- Deal.
- All right.

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,518
Knock knock. Hi.

31
00:01:04,602 --> 00:01:05,626
I'm looking for
Lucy Chen.

32
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:07,790
Uh, yeah, that's me.

33
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,126
Detective Misha Porter.

34
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:11,135
I teach at the undercover
academy up in Sacramento.

35
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:12,658
Yeah,
I know who you are.

36
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:15,695
Well, I'm doing some recruiting,
and your name keeps coming up.

37
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:17,531
You've worked several
impressive operations.

38
00:01:17,617 --> 00:01:20,813
Makes for an ideal candidate.
So I'm here to recruit you.

39
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:24,025
Uh...

40
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:25,456
When do classes start?

41
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,793
Next Monday.
Sorry for the late notice.

42
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,932
We had another candidate
fall out.

43
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:30,900
But I'm positive your sergeant
will approve it.

44
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:32,969
Yeah, he... he would, for sure.

45
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:34,478
It's just I have, um...

46
00:01:34,563 --> 00:01:36,908
I have some things going on
in my personal life right now,

47
00:01:36,992 --> 00:01:37,923
and...

48
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:40,103
If... it's not a good time,
I get it.

49
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:42,712
But you should know

50
00:01:42,796 --> 00:01:44,853
my classes will open up
a ton of doors for you.

51
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,222
No, I-I know.

52
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:48,501
Detective Harper
has told me all about it.

53
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:49,891
You'll have every major unit

54
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:52,525
competing to poach you
from patrol.

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,384
Um, this is amazing.
Thank you.

56
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:01,493
I-I will definitely think
about this.

57
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:02,844
Okay.

58
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:05,159
Thank you.

59
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:07,153
What are you doing?
Think about it?

60
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,558
No. Go out there
and tell her yes.

61
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:10,032
I can't.

62
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,532
Baby, you almost died.

63
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:16,766
But I didn't.
I'll... I'll be fine.

64
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:19,673
- Chris...
- Lucy, I'll be fine.

65
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:23,586
No.
I'm not leaving you.

66
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,594
Undercover school can wait.

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,931

The Realtor just needs you

79
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,907
to sign a couple of things
before the open house today.

80
00:03:07,992 --> 00:03:09,009
Absolutely.

81
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,198
What do you think?

82
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:11,875
Looks pretty good, right?

83
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,076
Unrecognizable.

84
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:14,212
The broker thinks
we're gonna have it sold

85
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:15,347
by the end of the week.

86
00:03:15,467 --> 00:03:17,188
That's great.

87
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:20,086
Once this place sells, we can
finally put it all behind us.

88
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,641
Yeah. Yeah, it'll be nice.
Can move on.

89
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:27,540
Don't.
Don't what?

90
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,211
Have feelings?

91
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:31,415
Don't get all misty-eyed
over Hill House.

92
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:34,819
It's our childhood home.
Selling it means something.

93
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:37,180
Hopefully it means
a half a million dollars each.

94
00:03:37,521 --> 00:03:40,533
I got to get to work.
Call me if you need anything.

95
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:42,329
Will do.

96
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:44,911
Now you're just showing off.

97
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:48,817
A 98 on your
training officer exam.

98
00:03:48,985 --> 00:03:50,063
Pretty impressive.

99
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:51,165
Thank you, sir.

100
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:53,401
So next week, you're off
to F.T.O. School

101
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:55,171
for post certification.

102
00:03:55,257 --> 00:03:57,055
And then, after that,

103
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,844
you will officially be
a Field Training Officer.

104
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:02,344
But until then,
I need someone

105
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,381
to finish training
Officer Thorsen.

106
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:06,235
You up
for a trial run?

107
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:07,780
Is that allowed?

108
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,251
It is if I say it is.

109
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:11,104
Harper has got him
most of the way there.

110
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,900
Only a few weeks
until he graduates.

111
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:14,461
I'm happy to do it.

112
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:18,197
And, sir, thank you for
all your help with this.

113
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:20,173
Please.
You're helping me out.

114
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:24,086
We've, um, come a long way,
haven't we, sir?

115
00:04:24,172 --> 00:04:25,322
Yeah.

116
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:27,750
Or maybe it's about time
I start calling you Wade?

117
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:29,731
Get out of my office,
Officer Nolan.

118
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:30,966
Yes, sir.

119
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:32,204
And close my door.

120
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,406
Yes, sir.

121
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:38,838
Good morning.

122
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:41,143
Good morning,
Officer Nolan.

123
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:43,081
I prepped the shop,
loaded the war bags,

124
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:45,774
and I got you
this cup of coffee here.

125
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:48,048
Harper trained you well.

126
00:04:48,132 --> 00:04:49,439
I mean,
if you want a challenge,

127
00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:52,509
I can be the, uh, worst rookie
you've ever come across.

128
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:53,745
Just be yourself.

129
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:54,908
Okay. I can do that.

130
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,146
You know, typically, I like to
start my morning off with,

131
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,266
you know, a little TikTok dance,
just to get, like,

132
00:04:59,351 --> 00:05:00,516
you know,
the hips warmed up.

133
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:01,595
It kind of helps...

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,024
A little less yourself.

135
00:05:03,697 --> 00:05:05,220
Copy that.

136
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:08,427
Everything's controlled
through here and the app.

137
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:10,750
Okay.
Looks simple enough.

138
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:14,315
What was that?

139
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:17,735
Uh, my wife's in pre-labor.
And we're having a home birth.

140
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,298
And you just moved?

141
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,235
Well, the plan was to wait until
after the baby,

142
00:05:24,321 --> 00:05:26,540
but then the nesting
hormones took over,

143
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:29,250
and the next thing I knew,
we were in escrow.

144
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:31,019
But I'm all over it.

145
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:34,064
I feel like I've trained
my whole life for this moment.

146
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:35,336
Cool.

147
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,634
All right. Assure Home Security
system is live.

148
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:42,595
Sensors on every door
and window.

149
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,730
Just need to put the app
on your phone.

150
00:05:44,816 --> 00:05:46,947
I forgot
they were even coming today.

151
00:05:47,031 --> 00:05:48,494
Oh, you got a lot
on your plate.

152
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:50,110
Just concentrate
on giving birth.

153
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:51,312
I've got the rest.

154
00:05:51,398 --> 00:05:52,165
<i>You know, when you said</i>

155
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,802
you were gonna be
a good labor assistant,

156
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:55,792
I thought it was just one
of those things that men say

157
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:57,146
when they act like
they know something

158
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,346
but they really don't.

159
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:00,360
Well, this is actually
my third rodeo.

160
00:06:00,446 --> 00:06:03,365
My ex had zero trust
in the medical system,

161
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:05,235
so both boys
were born at home.

162
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,415
You know, in a way,

163
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,742
I've actually got
more childbirth experience

164
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:09,744
than you do.

165
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,086
Thank God.
'Cause after last time,

166
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,494
I cannot imagine giving birth
in a hospital again.

167
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:18,798
Well, this birth
will be different.

168
00:06:18,882 --> 00:06:22,177
The placenta is completely clear
of the baby's pathway.

169
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:24,180
Your OB-GYN signed off.

170
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:25,978
We got the midwife
on speed dial,

171
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:29,048
and if anything goes wrong,
hospital is four minutes away.

172
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:31,677
But just FYI, I can get us to
the hospital in two minutes

173
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:33,461
because I know a shortcut.

174
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:36,707
Uh, I don't think a sidewalk
is considered a short cut.

175
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:39,144
Mm-hmm. Mm, mm!

176
00:06:39,228 --> 00:06:40,266
Contractions?

177
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,961
Mm-hmm.

178
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:44,571
Tell me we got this.

179
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:46,574
We got this.

180
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:49,110
Okay. Mm.

181
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,915
What was the color of the truck
three cars back?

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,524
Red.

183
00:06:55,752 --> 00:06:57,961
- How many sex workers have we passed?
- Four.

184
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,665
What are the crime stats
for this area?

185
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,079
- In this last week?
- Yes.

186
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:03,923
Um,
three motor vehicle thefts.

187
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,555
Two burglaries.
And seven thefts from vehicles.

188
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:09,946
All right. Here's something
you won't know...

189
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:12,946
What is the best sealant to use
when joining plastic to tile?

190
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:16,430
I mean, there's a lot
of great options,

191
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:20,062
but probably something
silicone-based would work best.

192
00:07:20,742 --> 00:07:21,845
How did you know that?

193
00:07:22,591 --> 00:07:24,180
You told me that yesterday.

194
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,375
Right.

195
00:07:26,461 --> 00:07:27,586
<i>7-Adam-15,</i>

196
00:07:27,672 --> 00:07:28,956
<i>I have a call for
a welfare check</i>

197
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,774
<i>at 707 Palm Street.</i>

198
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:32,805
Show us responding.

199
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,687
Police.

200
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:43,555
Hey, Nolan.

201
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:48,512
Hold your breath.

202
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,463
He's gone.

203
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:05,293
And he's a cop.

204
00:08:06,415 --> 00:08:07,997
Welcome to
the D.A.'s office.

205
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:09,552
Thanks.

206
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:11,598
I'm not gonna lie.
It's weird to be working here.

207
00:08:11,684 --> 00:08:12,699
Yeah, I'll bet.

208
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,833
Uh, break room's
around that corner over there,

209
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:16,701
where you'll find
every old-school snack

210
00:08:16,786 --> 00:08:18,572
you didn't think
they still made anymore.

211
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:21,408
Because they don't.
They're just old.

212
00:08:21,494 --> 00:08:22,646
Seriously.
Don't eat them.

213
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,615
Good to know.

214
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,841
And this is
your office.

215
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:28,596
And these are
your case files.

216
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,949
That... is a lot.

217
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:33,120
Well, we like to keep up
a brisk pace.

218
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:34,809
You spend too much time
in any one case,

219
00:08:34,894 --> 00:08:35,845
and the backlog
will kill you.

220
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,134
Hmm. Well, the good news is,
at least,

221
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,927
this one doesn't seem
worth pursuing.

222
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:42,929
Find the ones that are,
kick the rest.

223
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:45,981
Prosecutorial discretion
is a beautiful thing.

224
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:47,520
Have fun.

225
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:49,842
Yeah.

226
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:56,434
Thanks.

227
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:58,418
He one of ours?

228
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:00,535
Sheriff's Deputy.
His name's Garrett Patel.

229
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:03,207
He was dead when we arrived.
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

230
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:05,115
Let's make sure
we honor him

231
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,885
and not let anything
slip through the cracks.

232
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:08,355
- Right.
- Where's your rookie?

233
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,458
Uh, inside with T.I.D.
At this point in his training,

234
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:11,827
I thought it'd be valuable
for him to

235
00:09:11,912 --> 00:09:13,062
process a crime scene
with them.

236
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:16,076
Smart. All right,
I'll keep an eye on him,

237
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:17,514
and you go to the morgue
with our victim.

238
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:19,903
Dr. Roberts has agreed
to do a rush preliminary exam.

239
00:09:19,989 --> 00:09:21,984
All right. I'll swing by
afterwards, pick up Aaron.

240
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,450
Thanks.

241
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:31,360
So, this is the <i>rebozo</i>
lift and sift technique,

242
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,028
helps pull the weight
off the lower back.

243
00:09:33,113 --> 00:09:34,931
Mm. Feels amazing.

244
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:37,600
It can really help once the
contractions get more intense.

245
00:09:40,355 --> 00:09:41,706
What is that?

246
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:44,873
It's death metal. No...
Thrash metal. Thrash metal.

247
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:46,630
Mnh-mnh, no,
not at my home birth.

248
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:47,615
Help me up.

249
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,808
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

250
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:50,543
You relax.
Stay here.

251
00:09:50,893 --> 00:09:53,128
I'll go talk to them.

252
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:00,793
- Neighbor.
- What do you want?

253
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,264
W-We just moved in
across the street.

254
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,700
My... My wife and I
are having a baby, a home birth.

255
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,735
She just started
having contractions.

256
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:10,440
Uh, this music is not
on our labor play list,

257
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:12,033
if you know what I mean.

258
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:14,184
Um, can you turn it down?

259
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:15,754
No.

260
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:24,816
Okay, Nyla... Nyla, you don't
want to stress the baby.

261
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,482
I-I'm sure they'll turn it off
at some point.

262
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:28,134
Move.

263
00:10:32,572 --> 00:10:34,557
Turn the music down.

264
00:10:34,672 --> 00:10:35,873
Now.

265
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:38,989
Yo, turn it down.

266
00:10:43,716 --> 00:10:45,918
Thank you so much.

267
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:52,592
All I'll say is,
I'm glad you're on my side.

268
00:10:52,748 --> 00:10:54,107
You found something already?

269
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:55,244
Possibly.

270
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:57,183
I haven't done
the full autopsy yet,

271
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:00,688
but I found something concerning
on the external exam.

272
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:02,879
Several patches
of missing chest hair.

273
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:04,462
All around
the same position.

274
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:06,097
- Like it was pulled out.
- Right.

275
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:07,823
And I found some
adhesive residue

276
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:09,626
on the surrounding hair
and skin.

277
00:11:09,842 --> 00:11:13,371
Tape.
So maybe he was wearing a wire?

278
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:14,431
Doing undercover work?

279
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:15,573
One other thing.

280
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:17,086
All right.
What am I looking at here?

281
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:19,856
I found these fibers
on his wrists.

282
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:22,738
I believe they're from
soft wrist restraints,

283
00:11:22,822 --> 00:11:24,807
the kind that don't
leave marks.

284
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,043
Well, we didn't find anything
like that in the car,

285
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:29,611
which would suggest
he was restrained long enough

286
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:31,413
for the carbon monoxide
to do its job,

287
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:33,519
and then the restraints
were removed,

288
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:35,028
making it look
like a suicide.

289
00:11:35,113 --> 00:11:37,317
But why would someone
go to so much trouble

290
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:39,573
to murder
a Sheriff's Deputy?

291
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:43,950
Undercover school
sounds amazing.

292
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:45,543
"Self-surgery."

293
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:47,559
"Six things to say
when your cover's blown."

294
00:11:47,644 --> 00:11:50,403
"When your
informant is a double agent."

295
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:52,113
Yeah, you have to go.

296
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:53,847
This is where
I want to be.

297
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:56,597
Lucy, if you're staying here
out of guilt, don't.

298
00:11:58,231 --> 00:11:59,615
This wasn't your fault.

299
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,418
Of course it was my fault.

300
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,886
Rosalind targeted you
because of me.

301
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:05,923
She's angry that
I didn't testify.

302
00:12:06,006 --> 00:12:07,057
You don't know that.

303
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:08,926
Yes, I do.

304
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:10,831
I moved on.
She couldn't handle that.

305
00:12:10,917 --> 00:12:13,428
She'd been looking forward to
torturing me on the stand.

306
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:16,100
And when I took that
away from her, she...

307
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:17,808
She tried to take you.

308
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:18,965
But she didn't.

309
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:20,075
Chris...

310
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,159
No.

311
00:12:23,224 --> 00:12:26,551
Listen, if you skip U.C. school
because of this,

312
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:28,533
that's something
she <i>wi</i> be taking from you.

313
00:12:32,736 --> 00:12:34,588
Hey.
Garrett Patel was assigned

314
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:37,125
to a special narcotics unit
in the Sheriff's Department.

315
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:38,911
Word is they run
mostly reversals.

316
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:40,355
Which means?

317
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:41,993
Which means
law enforcement officers

318
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:43,448
pose as drug sellers.

319
00:12:43,533 --> 00:12:45,152
They flash real dope
to lure the buyers.

320
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:46,788
And then, when the money
is exchanged,

321
00:12:46,874 --> 00:12:48,230
they make the arrest. Nice.

322
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:49,567
You think Garrett
was wearing a wire

323
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:50,669
as part of
an investigation?

324
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:52,806
Maybe. But it doesn't
explain his murder.

325
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:55,341
A staged suicide isn't exactly
a drug dealer's go-to.

326
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:56,609
They're a lot less subtle.

327
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,010
So what's next?
We reach out to his unit?

328
00:12:58,095 --> 00:12:59,386
Garrett's ex-wife
just landed.

329
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:01,746
I'll talk to her first.
See if she has any insight.

330
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:03,124
Right.

331
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:06,113
We got divorced,
uh, five months ago,

332
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:08,216
but we still talked.

333
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:09,355
About work?

334
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,409
A little.
Garrett seemed really stressed.

335
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,628
And of course
he wouldn't tell me why.

336
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,798
Part of the reason why we split
was because it was clear

337
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:20,519
that he was keeping
things from me.

338
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,581
And it got really bad
at the end.

339
00:13:25,482 --> 00:13:28,511
His narcotics buddies
would come over to play poker,

340
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,073
and the second I walked in
the room, they would get quiet.

341
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:32,642
Can I get their names?

342
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:34,746
Yeah, it's,
uh, Walt Lindbeck.

343
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:36,015
He's the team leader.

344
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,019
Super cocky.
Thinks he's God's gift.

345
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:42,019
Um, Simon Ayer.

346
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:43,990
He's a sweet guy.

347
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:45,325
He's young, like Garrett.

348
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,566
But Rick Croyer...

349
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,529
He just gave me
a bad feeling.

350
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:52,432
Look, don't get me wrong.

351
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:54,100
We had other problems
with our marriage.

352
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:58,171
But when Garrett started
hanging with "The Crew," that...

353
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,407
That was the beginning
of the end.

354
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:01,541
Wait.

355
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,715
They call themselves
"The Crew"?

356
00:14:03,831 --> 00:14:05,278
When will cops learn?

357
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:07,043
Learn what?

358
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:09,024
Look, you can hang out
with other cops all you want,

359
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:10,860
but the second
you give your group a name,

360
00:14:10,967 --> 00:14:12,851
it's just a matter of time
until you're under indictment.

361
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,888
Really?
Does that work for any name?

362
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:16,923
What if you call yourselves
"The Snuggle Bunch"?

363
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:18,684
- You're going to prison.
- Totally.

364
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,226
I can't explain it,
but it never fails.

365
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:22,129
Give yourself a name,
go to jail.

366
00:14:22,212 --> 00:14:23,529
Noted.
But I think the judge

367
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:24,825
is gonna want
a little more than that.

368
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:26,582
So how are we going after
these guys?

369
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:31,013
You're kidding.
10 offers already?

370
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:32,238
That's incredible.

371
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,441
I know.
I'm a little in shock.

372
00:14:34,597 --> 00:14:35,807
<i>So, what's
the highest offer?</i>

373
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:37,409
$50,000 over asking.

374
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:38,544
From a developer.

375
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,413
<i>But there's also
this family.</i>

376
00:14:40,496 --> 00:14:42,715
The dad included the most
touching letter with the offer,

377
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,216
<i>all about how much
it would mean to his kids</i>

378
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,751
<i>to finally have a home.</i>

379
00:14:45,859 --> 00:14:46,980
Okay, so,
what's their offer?

380
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,120
Asking.

381
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:49,456
So $50,000 less.

382
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:51,293
It's still more than
we expected to get.

383
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:53,029
Besides, the developer
will just tear it down.

384
00:14:53,114 --> 00:14:54,763
Good. House is
an actual crime scene.

385
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:55,827
It should be torn down.

386
00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:57,715
Listen, Genny,
I got to go.

387
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,432
Keep me posted.

388
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:02,501
Hey.
Uh, I'll do a number three.

389
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:04,336
- Coming right up.
- Thank you.

390
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,836
We got a number three.

391
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:09,316
What's up, gentlemen?
Hey.

392
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,919
You guys, uh, work with that
deputy that killed himself?

393
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:13,322
We did, actually.

394
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:15,125
Sorry for your loss.

395
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:17,206
Tim Bradford,
Mid-Wilshire Division.

396
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,408
My guys found the body.

397
00:15:18,494 --> 00:15:20,412
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, it's always tough

398
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:22,278
to lose someone
you were in the trenches with.

399
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:24,522
I just wish we had realized
how much he'd been hurting.

400
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:26,525
It's got to be rough.

401
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,360
Well, look, if you guys
need anything...

402
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:29,528
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

403
00:15:29,613 --> 00:15:31,323
Actually, uh...

404
00:15:31,442 --> 00:15:33,184
you know,
we've been hearing some rumors

405
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:34,975
- about foul play.
- Yeah?

406
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,206
Hadn't heard that.
I can check, though.

407
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:38,705
You guys
working on something

408
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:40,273
that could have
come back on him?

409
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,540
Eh, that's tough to say.

410
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,975
We put away a lot
of bad hombres,

411
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:44,777
but nobody immediately
springs to mind.

412
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,946
Well,
I'll tell you this,

413
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,216
if someone did
kill Garrett,

414
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:52,652
they're not gonna survive
that trip to lockup.

415
00:15:52,735 --> 00:15:55,121
I can do some digging
and get back to you.

416
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,724
Sergeant Lindbeck.

417
00:15:57,807 --> 00:15:59,692
It's Walt.
Much appreciated.

418
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:01,160
Yeah. Least I could do.

419
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:02,995
Cops got to stick together, right?

420
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,397
Damn right.

421
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,895
- Take care.
- You too.

422
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:08,634
Those aren't grieving faces.

423
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,302
Those are guys terrified
of getting caught.

424
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,903
Great.
Where's my burrito?

425
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:14,716
Sorry. I got distracted trying
to gaslight crooked cops.

426
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:15,895
Crooked how?

427
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,476
- They're running reversals, right?
- Mm-hmm.

428
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,977
So instead of
arresting the dealers,

429
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,272
they're taking the cash
and cutting them free.

430
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,942
With their intel, they would
know exactly who to target.

431
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:24,716
And with their access
to real drugs,

432
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,599
they could make sales
seem legit.

433
00:16:26,683 --> 00:16:29,235
And it's not like the dealers
can call the cops to complain.

434
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:30,657
I'll read Wesley in.

435
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,325
I need you guys
to hit up your CIs.

436
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,360
If The Crew
are ripping off dealers,

437
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:35,995
there's gonna be a lot of
pissed-off criminals out there.

438
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,596
Someone's heard something.

439
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:40,150
You know, Harper has got
the best CIs in the station.

440
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:41,768
You're right.

441
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:44,292
Nolan, call Harper.

442
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,438
She likes you best.

443
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:47,539
Really?

444
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:48,607
Mm-hmm.

445
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,393
On it.

446
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,684
That was a dirty lie.

447
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,246
Today is her due date.

448
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:55,914
Do you want to be the one
calling her about work?

449
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,585
You're an evil genius.
Emphasis on the "evil."

450
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:00,720
Damn straight.
Now give me half that burrito

451
00:17:00,803 --> 00:17:03,105
before I turn my evil
against you.

452
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:08,573
So, how's Lucy?

453
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:10,943
Uh, you know,
she's still a little shaken.

454
00:17:11,174 --> 00:17:13,326
Taking some time
to get Chris settled.

455
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:16,065
Remind me what you were doing
at her apartment

456
00:17:16,337 --> 00:17:18,073
when you found Chris
bleeding out?

457
00:17:18,596 --> 00:17:21,449
Just... dropping her off
after we got back from Vegas.

458
00:17:21,534 --> 00:17:23,019
Mm-hmm.

459
00:17:25,016 --> 00:17:26,116
What are you implying?

460
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,854
What do you think?

461
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:32,318
I was just dropping her off.

462
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,729
Mm-hmm.

463
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,690
You don't have to
answer that.

464
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:44,463
Nolan,
has someone been shot?

465
00:17:44,548 --> 00:17:46,165
No. <i>Did someone
catch Rosalind Dyer?</i>

466
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,924
No.
Okay, then I'm hanging up.

467
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:48,893
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

468
00:17:48,978 --> 00:17:50,239
There's a corrupt group
of deputies.

469
00:17:50,323 --> 00:17:51,402
They killed
one of their own.

470
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:53,394
All right, talk fast.
The whole point of a home birth

471
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,775
is to be left alone
to suffer in peace.

472
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:57,443
You're in labor?
Like right now?

473
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,354
Nolan, fast.

474
00:17:59,518 --> 00:18:01,332
Uh, we think
they're ripping off dealers.

475
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,471
We need your best CI.

476
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:04,402
Uh, okay. Abel Law ton.

477
00:18:04,487 --> 00:18:06,286
I will text you
his phone number.

478
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:07,920
Thank you. Good...

479
00:18:08,324 --> 00:18:09,992
Good luck.

480
00:18:13,548 --> 00:18:15,432
Hey. You still wading through
those case files?

481
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:16,855
No, I'm done.

482
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,096
You read them all,

483
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,465
or you just skimmed them
for the headlines?

484
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,834
- Well, I got the gist.
- Ah.

485
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,910
Jonathan, 19-year-old kid
arrested a year ago

486
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:25,037
on a gun charge.

487
00:18:25,121 --> 00:18:26,605
Since then,
he's got his act together.

488
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:28,174
Taking trade school classes.

489
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:30,799
He's about to be credentialed
as a specialized pipefitter.

490
00:18:31,094 --> 00:18:32,545
I'm gonna knock that one
down to a misdemeanor.

491
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:34,113
You're knocking down charges

492
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:35,567
while violent crime
is on the rise?

493
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:38,718
I don't think that
he's a violent criminal.

494
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:40,487
Huh. I think he carried
a gun for protection

495
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,288
in a neighborhood
where that makes sense.

496
00:18:42,373 --> 00:18:43,323
I could run you down
my whole list,

497
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:44,723
but that would take a while.
No, no.

498
00:18:44,807 --> 00:18:48,194
Just tell me how many cases you're gonna plead
out and how many cases you're taking to trial,

499
00:18:48,278 --> 00:18:50,329
keeping in mind
the correct ratio

500
00:18:50,413 --> 00:18:52,464
is nine plea bargains
for every trial.

501
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,401
Zero. And zero.

502
00:18:54,484 --> 00:18:56,635
Well,
that's not an option.

503
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,837
I'm just exercising
my prosecutorial discretion.

504
00:18:58,922 --> 00:19:01,007
Ha ha ha. Look.

505
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,009
Pick a case to charge,
any case,

506
00:19:03,093 --> 00:19:04,876
by the end of the day, okay?

507
00:19:04,961 --> 00:19:07,498
We didn't hire you so you can
give everyone a free pass.

508
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:17,690
Hey.

509
00:19:17,773 --> 00:19:19,392
<i>Hey. Got some time?</i>

510
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:21,493
We have a case.
It's gonna be tricky.

511
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,862
Does it involve
punishing the poor?

512
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:25,265
<i>No. Dirty cops.</i>

513
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:27,165
I'll be right there.

514
00:19:32,323 --> 00:19:34,574
You think it's too early
to get in the pool?

515
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:36,075
No.

516
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:38,076
Warm water
could help you relax

517
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:40,447
and relieve
some of your back pain.

518
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,181
What is that lovely smell?

519
00:19:42,265 --> 00:19:44,416
Mm.
I rubbed the lavender oil

520
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,119
onto my skin
so that my scent could calm you.

521
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:49,955
You really do
think of everything.

522
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,423
Mm-hmm.

523
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:52,459
You were cool with it
in the beginning.

524
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,464
Is that the neighbors again?
I'm going over there.

525
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:58,397
Mnh-mnh.
No, no, no, no, you're not.

526
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:00,732
Just call in
a noise complaint.

527
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,050
Uh, fireworks?

528
00:20:04,135 --> 00:20:06,272
No, that was gunshots.

529
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:10,963
Officer Nyla Harper.

530
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:14,471
Shots fired
near 5575 Orange Grove.

531
00:20:17,643 --> 00:20:19,361
Well, looks like
a false alarm.

532
00:20:19,461 --> 00:20:21,346
Didn't sound false.

533
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,597
Your neighbors said they were
watching "Dirty Harry."

534
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:24,875
That's got to be
what you heard.

535
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,210
Smitty, I am telling you,
I heard live gunshots.

536
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:28,791
We did a thorough search
of the house.

537
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:30,807
There was no sign
of foul play.

538
00:20:30,892 --> 00:20:33,476
And the only guns
that I saw...

539
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:34,890
were on that homey's arms.

540
00:20:34,974 --> 00:20:37,377
That dude is ripped.

541
00:20:37,462 --> 00:20:38,635
Thank you, Smitty.

542
00:20:38,721 --> 00:20:40,839
You are as much help
as I thought you would be.

543
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:42,143
You need a hand
with anything else?

544
00:20:42,227 --> 00:20:43,869
No, thank you. Goodbye.

545
00:20:51,345 --> 00:20:52,761
Maybe it was "Dirty Harry."

546
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:55,127
I mean, they've got a serious
sound system in there.

547
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,798
Those shots were from
a high-caliber weapon,

548
00:20:56,883 --> 00:20:58,987
not a 40-year-old handgun.

549
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:02,349
It was a big gun.

550
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:06,125
Just saying.

551
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:08,462
Mr. Law ton,
thank you for coming in.

552
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:10,613
<i>Yeah.
Uh, can you make it quick?</i>

553
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:12,089
<i>I-I-I don't like
being here.</i>

554
00:21:12,174 --> 00:21:13,459
Oh, I'm sorry.

555
00:21:13,544 --> 00:21:14,796
You know, we could have
come to your place,

556
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,031
but that might have
jammed you up.

557
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,799
Okay, spare me the attitude,
all right?

558
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:20,002
You guys clearly need
something from me.

559
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:21,385
And I should warn you,
all right,

560
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:24,324
my rates have gone up
substantially since,

561
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,855
you know, I've been
selling intel to the Feds...

562
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,752
Yes, Harper did
warn us about that.

563
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:32,268
She told us to tell you,
"Remember Oceanside."

564
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,922
Okay. Uh...

565
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:41,282
On second thought, um...

566
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,612
Uh, for a friend of Harper's,
it's free.

567
00:21:43,697 --> 00:21:45,769
Uh, what do you... what...
What do you need?

568
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:47,808
What do you know about anyone
ripping off drug dealers?

569
00:21:49,195 --> 00:21:51,114
You mean those
Sheriff's Department guys?

570
00:21:51,198 --> 00:21:53,213
Uh, yeah.

571
00:21:53,351 --> 00:21:57,005
They hit up my boy, Junior,
for like 100K.

572
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:58,887
Okay, well, uh,
we need to talk to him.

573
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:00,057
So where is he?

574
00:22:00,141 --> 00:22:01,490
He's in lockup.

575
00:22:01,575 --> 00:22:04,791
Or... at least he was.

576
00:22:05,181 --> 00:22:06,682
He's in the morgue now.

577
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:10,463
Got shanked in prison
like two hours ago.

578
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:14,001
They gave themselves a name.
When are cops gonna learn?

579
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:15,270
Clearly never.

580
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:17,173
And so far,
evidence is sketchy at best.

581
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:18,407
We think our victim
was recording

582
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:19,741
their criminal activity,

583
00:22:19,826 --> 00:22:21,077
but we can't
find the recordings.

584
00:22:21,162 --> 00:22:22,845
And we had
a potential witness,

585
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:25,015
but he magically got shanked
in prison earlier today.

586
00:22:25,098 --> 00:22:26,316
All right.
So what about financial records?

587
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,517
If they're stealing
from drug dealers,

588
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:28,750
where is the money going?

589
00:22:28,835 --> 00:22:29,987
Nowhere we can find.

590
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,421
Clearly, they're being
very disciplined

591
00:22:31,505 --> 00:22:32,521
with the cash
they're stealing.

592
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:33,789
Then you need
the recordings.

593
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,458
Without them,
there's no case.

594
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:37,177
I know.

595
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:40,528
Hi.
Lucy.

596
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:42,965
Uh,
were we expecting you?

597
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:45,768
Oh, no. But I-I heard
today was the big day,

598
00:22:45,852 --> 00:22:48,637
so I brought you some food
so you didn't have to go out.

599
00:22:48,721 --> 00:22:50,472
That is
very sweet of you.

600
00:22:50,557 --> 00:22:52,674
Uh, Nyla, Lucy's here.

601
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,676
So, it's totally vegetarian.
Ashwagandha...

602
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,314
Oh, my God!
You are glowing.

603
00:22:57,397 --> 00:22:59,148
I am not,
but thank you.

604
00:22:59,232 --> 00:23:00,182
And thank you
for the food.

605
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:02,285
Mm-hmm.

606
00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:03,885
So, hey, while I'm here,

607
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,355
I wanted to
run something by you.

608
00:23:05,439 --> 00:23:08,458
Um, I was offered a spot
in U.C. school.

609
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,127
That's great. That's g...
You... You deserve it.

610
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:12,694
Um, quick question.
- Mm.

611
00:23:12,778 --> 00:23:14,396
What do you think about that
house across the street?

612
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,034
Oh, I-I didn't
really notice it.

613
00:23:17,117 --> 00:23:19,336
So, the thing is, Chris just got
out of the hospital,

614
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,836
and he really
needs me to help him.

615
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,638
Okay, so, James thinks
that I should drop it,

616
00:23:22,722 --> 00:23:24,740
but something is going on
over at that house.

617
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:27,309
I heard gunshots earlier on.

618
00:23:27,394 --> 00:23:29,412
And they sent Smitty.
But I know Smitty is...

619
00:23:29,496 --> 00:23:31,814
Nyla Harper.

620
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:33,016
Yes.

621
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,518
Are you roping Lucy
into your fantasy?

622
00:23:35,602 --> 00:23:36,853
It's not a fantasy.

623
00:23:36,936 --> 00:23:39,088
O-Okay.
I didn't mean it like that.

624
00:23:39,173 --> 00:23:41,357
I apologize.
But the truth is,

625
00:23:41,442 --> 00:23:45,595
labor induces a tidal wave
of physiological changes.

626
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,197
Hormone levels spike,

627
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,000
neurotransmitters jack up a kind
of fight-or-flight response.

628
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:53,269
Okay, is this just
your way of saying

629
00:23:53,354 --> 00:23:54,769
that it's all in my head?

630
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:57,374
No.

631
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,409
All I'm saying is
you're about to give birth,

632
00:23:59,492 --> 00:24:01,044
and you're hypersensitive

633
00:24:01,127 --> 00:24:03,079
to anything that might
seem like a threat.

634
00:24:03,163 --> 00:24:05,221
Yeah.
That seems logical.

635
00:24:05,306 --> 00:24:07,384
Okay, uh, you know what?
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

636
00:24:07,468 --> 00:24:10,287
Um, should I say yes?

637
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,587
To what?

638
00:24:11,672 --> 00:24:12,954
To U.C. school?

639
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:14,457
Yes.

640
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,692
Say yes.

641
00:24:15,776 --> 00:24:16,925
Oh...

642
00:24:18,211 --> 00:24:20,547
I swear it'd be quieter
at a hospital.

643
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:51,794
Police!
Show yourself right now.

644
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:56,704
I don't want to hear it.

645
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:58,468
You broke the seal.
You're in my crime scene.

646
00:24:58,551 --> 00:24:59,876
It was our guy
who went down.

647
00:24:59,961 --> 00:25:01,588
You think we're just gonna
stand on the sidelines,

648
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:03,439
watch the LAPD
screw up the investigation?

649
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:04,941
- You buying this?
- No.

650
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,540
Listen,
we're all on the same team...

651
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:08,609
Wrong.
We're investigating a homicide,

652
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:11,900
and you appear to be attempting
to obstruct that investigation.

653
00:25:11,984 --> 00:25:13,349
You don't know what
you're talking about, honey.

654
00:25:13,433 --> 00:25:14,392
Come on, let's go.

655
00:25:14,477 --> 00:25:16,185
We got a warrant
to search everything, Walt,

656
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:17,487
including you.

657
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,838
That's not happening.

658
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:20,256
You don't want to
walk into this.

659
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,642
Try me.

660
00:25:22,868 --> 00:25:24,128
Aah!

661
00:25:24,268 --> 00:25:25,564
Don't.

662
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,234
Get up. Get up.

663
00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:30,767
Come on.

664
00:25:30,915 --> 00:25:32,947
Hands behind your back.

665
00:25:42,477 --> 00:25:44,662
Shipping receipt
with Garrett's name on it.

666
00:25:44,886 --> 00:25:46,538
A million bucks
it's a recording

667
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,651
from the wire
Garrett was wearing.

668
00:25:48,734 --> 00:25:49,993
You're under arrest, gentlemen,

669
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,770
for removing evidence
and obstruction.

670
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:53,501
Turn around.

671
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:55,653
Where's your buddy Rick?

672
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,028
How about you?
You can help yourself here.

673
00:26:00,113 --> 00:26:01,971
Don't say a word.
Don't listen to him.

674
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:03,258
Where's Rick?

675
00:26:06,028 --> 00:26:08,381
You know, you'd think
cops would be smarter.

676
00:26:08,778 --> 00:26:11,321
This warrant
covers your phone.

677
00:26:16,686 --> 00:26:18,086
Called Rick right before
we came in.

678
00:26:23,343 --> 00:26:24,454
Hello.

679
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:26,040
<i>Hey.
Tim and I found The Crew</i>

680
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,089
<i>at Garrett's house doing
some evidence tampering.</i>

681
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:30,192
We think Garrett mailed
the recordings to himself

682
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:31,861
at Coast to Post
Mailbox Service,

683
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:33,588
7646 West Vernon.

684
00:26:33,673 --> 00:26:34,618
We're on it.

685
00:26:34,703 --> 00:26:36,665
Move your ass.
Rick's already on his way there.

686
00:26:36,782 --> 00:26:38,601
If he gets there first,
he'll destroy the evidence.

687
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,236
Hit it.

688
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,354
Is it okay
if I take a quick shower?

689
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,072
- Yep.
- You sure?

690
00:26:47,156 --> 00:26:48,156
Yep.

691
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:49,561
Okay.

692
00:27:11,192 --> 00:27:13,045
"Dirty Harry" my ass.

693
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:06,821
You left the trunk open.

694
00:28:06,906 --> 00:28:09,192
No, I didn't.

695
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,298
Hey, neighbor!
Hey, hey!

696
00:28:30,384 --> 00:28:31,798
How you doing?

697
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:32,967
Sorry to bother you.

698
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:34,068
Oh.

699
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:36,395
Our cat ran out,
um, and she...

700
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,618
She's a-a total troublemaker,

701
00:28:38,703 --> 00:28:40,557
um, but she's been declawed

702
00:28:40,642 --> 00:28:42,874
so it's not safe for her
to be wandering around out here.

703
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,329
You haven't seen her,
have you?

704
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:45,531
No.

705
00:28:45,616 --> 00:28:48,536
No. Okay. Uh, damn.

706
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:51,849
Well, please let me know
if you do.

707
00:28:52,371 --> 00:28:53,940
Thank you.

708
00:28:55,662 --> 00:28:56,998
Thanks again.

709
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,190
Okay, what the hell
were you doing over there?

710
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:17,258
Gathering evidence.

711
00:29:17,343 --> 00:29:18,861
Without a warrant?

712
00:29:18,945 --> 00:29:20,829
Don't lecture me.
My water just broke.

713
00:29:20,914 --> 00:29:22,612
The law still applies.

714
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:24,907
Wait... W-W-What, what?

715
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:26,454
Mm-hmm.
Oh, come on, come on.

716
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,557
We got to get you
in the birthing tub,

717
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:29,162
and I got to call the midwife.
Come on.

718
00:29:35,426 --> 00:29:36,943
All right.
You go around front.

719
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:37,875
I'll scope it out inside.

720
00:29:37,961 --> 00:29:39,262
Copy that.

721
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,280
Hey!
Hey, you guys need to move.

722
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:05,190
Give me the package.

723
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:07,925
I-I'm looking.
Please don't point that at me.

724
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:08,750
Hurry up!

725
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:10,538
O-Okay. Okay.

726
00:30:12,003 --> 00:30:13,154
Give it up, Rick.

727
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,757
Walt and Simon
are already in custody.

728
00:30:14,894 --> 00:30:16,829
You're just making things worse
for yourself.

729
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:30,248
Stay here, all right?

730
00:30:38,006 --> 00:30:38,917
Get down!

731
00:30:39,002 --> 00:30:39,980
Give me your hands.

732
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,268
Both of them. Come on.

733
00:30:47,481 --> 00:30:48,886
You broke my ribs.

734
00:30:48,971 --> 00:30:52,124
You killed a cop.
You're under arrest.

735
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,605
Where you been?

736
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:06,739
Nyla,
you have the baby yet?

737
00:31:08,369 --> 00:31:10,355
Hey, Nyla.

738
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:12,137
<i>Aah. I need you to
look into my neighbors.</i>

739
00:31:12,222 --> 00:31:14,026
Um, I heard gunshots,

740
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:15,559
and I-I think
that there's something

741
00:31:15,644 --> 00:31:18,622
going on
over there.

742
00:31:18,707 --> 00:31:23,067
It's, uh,
5574 Orange Grove.

743
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:25,880
You literally sound like
you're having a baby right now.

744
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:26,971
Mm, basically.

745
00:31:27,055 --> 00:31:30,300
And these guys, they are
messing with my birth plan.

746
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,377
Oh, oh. Okay.

747
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:37,223
Uh, I saw them moving
what could have been a body

748
00:31:37,308 --> 00:31:38,482
<i>into the trunk
of their car.</i>

749
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:42,086
And I found hydrofluoric acid
in there as well.

750
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:45,051
But I-I saw all of this
without a warrant.

751
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:47,525
I'll run the homeowner
and any associates.

752
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:50,394
But I need you to focus on
having the baby.

753
00:31:50,597 --> 00:31:53,098
If I find anything,
I'll get in touch.

754
00:31:53,183 --> 00:31:55,099
Okay, okay. Thank you.

755
00:31:55,183 --> 00:31:58,236
Um, did I hear you
talking to somebody?

756
00:31:58,319 --> 00:31:59,371
Nope.

757
00:31:59,454 --> 00:32:01,905
Ooh.

758
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,342
Ooh, ice chips.
Thank you. Yes.

759
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:07,429
Oh, oh!

760
00:32:08,325 --> 00:32:11,567
Doesn't feel good to be on that
side of the table, does it?

761
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:12,926
No.

762
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:14,786
Prison's gonna feel
even worse.

763
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:17,555
And before you give me your song
and dance about your innocence,

764
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:20,291
you should know
Garrett wore a wire for months.

765
00:32:20,375 --> 00:32:22,759
There are dozens of hours
of recordings.

766
00:32:23,347 --> 00:32:24,461
You want a sample?

767
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:25,863
<i>It's zero eight hundred.</i>

768
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:27,880
<i>We're about to meet a buyer,
Junior Mills.</i>

769
00:32:27,964 --> 00:32:29,567
<i>Hey, where you been?
Let's go.</i>

770
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:32,309
<i>Sorry, Walt.
Just getting my head right.</i>

771
00:32:32,394 --> 00:32:34,372
<i>Simon, what's up?</i>

772
00:32:36,157 --> 00:32:39,411
See how Garrett name checks
you and Walt? Smart.

773
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:42,279
<i>Well, let's get in there.
It's payday.</i>

774
00:32:42,542 --> 00:32:44,137
<i>You know how this works, Junior.</i>

775
00:32:44,222 --> 00:32:46,106
<i>We let you get a taste,
now show us the money.</i>

776
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:47,208
<i>It's all there.</i>

777
00:32:47,292 --> 00:32:48,720
<i>Great. Now beat it.</i>

778
00:32:48,804 --> 00:32:50,248
<i>You got to be kidding me.</i>

779
00:32:50,332 --> 00:32:51,222
<i>You got five
to start walking</i>

780
00:32:51,307 --> 00:32:52,747
<i>and if we see you again...</i>

781
00:32:52,832 --> 00:32:54,786
Yeah, there it is.

782
00:32:54,871 --> 00:32:56,747
Your crew stealing from
the drug dealers

783
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,747
you're supposed to arrest.

784
00:32:57,832 --> 00:33:00,380
Most of them slink away,
but Junior talked.

785
00:33:00,464 --> 00:33:03,167
Told anyone he could
about the crew who robbed him.

786
00:33:03,251 --> 00:33:05,419
And Junior
ended up dead.

787
00:33:05,503 --> 00:33:07,473
I don't know anything
about that.

788
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:08,871
You got one chance
to come clean.

789
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:09,967
Tell us everything you know,

790
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,721
and I'm prepared to
offer you leniency.

791
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,334
Walt will kill me.

792
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:16,005
He won't be able to get
anywhere near you.

793
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:17,281
I promise.

794
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:19,402
It's time to do
the right thing

795
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:21,292
for Garrett.

796
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,865
Where is the midwife?

797
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:29,461
She's on her way.
There's traffic.

798
00:33:29,545 --> 00:33:32,028
Remember, don't scream.
It's... It's just wasted energy.

799
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:33,265
Channel it into breathing.

800
00:33:33,348 --> 00:33:35,833
Aah!
Come on.

801
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:38,302
Okay, yeah, that's fine, too.
That's fine, too.

802
00:33:38,386 --> 00:33:39,997
Come on. Here you go.

803
00:33:40,097 --> 00:33:42,116
Mm.

804
00:33:42,223 --> 00:33:44,326
I thought you said the second
one was always easier.

805
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:45,809
I said usually.

806
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:47,638
Maybe the third will be
the easy one, hmm?

807
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,007
Sorry.
That was too soon, too soon.

808
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,352
Let me guess, that's the midwife
saying she can't make it.

809
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:56,953
No, it's the Assure
Home Security app.

810
00:33:57,411 --> 00:34:01,365
The security system has detected
an open window downstairs.

811
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:04,201
Someone's in the house.

812
00:34:04,507 --> 00:34:06,442
Not necessarily...

813
00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:09,403
Get my gun.

814
00:34:09,784 --> 00:34:12,177
Okay, Nyla,
you are fully dilated.

815
00:34:12,262 --> 00:34:13,858
This baby is coming
any minute now.

816
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:15,429
It's the murderers
from across the street.

817
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,153
Get my damn gun.

818
00:34:20,965 --> 00:34:23,248
Okay, you stay here, okay?

819
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:25,217
I'll go check it out.
Stay here.

820
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,505
What? No... James, stay...
No. James, you...

821
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:52,369
Drop the gun.
I am in here giving life,

822
00:36:52,516 --> 00:36:55,699
but I will take yours
if you even twitch.

823
00:37:06,927 --> 00:37:08,413
7-Adam-200, shots fired,

824
00:37:08,496 --> 00:37:09,884
officer needs help
at my location.

825
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:17,800
Hey!

826
00:37:19,597 --> 00:37:21,347
Nyla!

827
00:37:21,969 --> 00:37:23,721
Wait!

828
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:32,317
It's a girl.

829
00:37:37,148 --> 00:37:38,798
Welcome to the world, kiddo.

830
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,679
I promise it won't always
be this insane.

831
00:37:41,764 --> 00:37:43,871
Hey, are you okay?

832
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:45,985
Well,
all things considered.

833
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,702
Was I right about the body?

834
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:51,375
You were right.
GSW to the chest.

835
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,344
Looking like they had a hidden
basement in the house

836
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:55,550
where they put the body
when Smitty came calling.

837
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:58,492
You definitely win
the best childbirth story.

838
00:37:58,577 --> 00:38:01,117
I don't know. You have
that whole Guatemala adventure.

839
00:38:01,202 --> 00:38:03,585
Yeah, but I didn't
have the baby down there.

840
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,242
Accept the crown.
You earned it.

841
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:08,179
He's right.

842
00:38:08,264 --> 00:38:10,070
T.I.D.s are finishing up downstairs.

843
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:11,751
You still got to talk
to the shooting team,

844
00:38:11,835 --> 00:38:13,485
but they can wait
a few days.

845
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:14,688
You're on
maternity leave.

846
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:17,804
Yes.
Uh, no more investigations.

847
00:38:18,217 --> 00:38:19,500
You promise?

848
00:38:19,585 --> 00:38:21,851
Look, if an escaped convict

849
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:23,445
comes into
my Mommy and Me class,

850
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,452
then I will have
no choice.

851
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,389
But, barring that,

852
00:38:26,474 --> 00:38:28,163
I will spend the next six weeks

853
00:38:28,248 --> 00:38:29,998
just staring at
this little angel.

854
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:32,599
<i>♪ Thought it'd be easy, easy</i>

855
00:38:32,684 --> 00:38:35,673
<i>- ♪ To find my way, all the way home ♪</i>
- Let me guess, an orphanage wants

856
00:38:35,757 --> 00:38:37,521
to buy Dad's house
for a hundred bucks.

857
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:39,278
No.

858
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,152
Listen, I haven't been
entirely honest with you.

859
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,789
The phone call
this morning?

860
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,608
Yeah.

861
00:38:47,596 --> 00:38:50,599
Rob and I are
having a hard time.

862
00:38:51,157 --> 00:38:53,675
Like go to counseling
hard time?

863
00:38:53,806 --> 00:38:56,427
Like divorce lawyers
hard time.

864
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:58,349
I'm sorry.

865
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:00,248
Me too.

866
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:02,380
But it's for the best.

867
00:39:02,864 --> 00:39:04,262
Now, about Dad's house...

868
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:05,896
You want to sell it
to the happy family

869
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:07,231
because you're feeling nostalgic.

870
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:08,733
No, I want to sell it
to the highest bidder

871
00:39:08,818 --> 00:39:10,336
because divorces aren't cheap,
and I need

872
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,130
to cushion the landing
into single mom-hood.

873
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:16,528
Wow. Uh, very smart.

874
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:19,545
So, is...
Is Rob moving out?

875
00:39:19,768 --> 00:39:22,326
Actually,
I was thinking of moving.

876
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:24,068
To where?

877
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,811
Here.

878
00:39:26,027 --> 00:39:28,661
I mean,
unless you don't want me to.

879
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:31,666
Are you kidding?
I think it's a great idea.

880
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:34,804
Good. Now give me a hug
'cause I just told you

881
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:36,943
my marriage fell apart,
and I'm trying to be strong,

882
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:38,677
but I'm feeling really sad.

883
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:43,324
How was your first day?

884
00:39:43,576 --> 00:39:45,657
You know, I was worried
that it might be weird

885
00:39:45,742 --> 00:39:46,632
working on the other side,

886
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,202
but I think
it might actually work out.

887
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:49,436
Don't get too excited.

888
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:51,074
You won't get to arrest
crooked cops every day.

889
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,342
I hope you're wrong.

890
00:39:52,427 --> 00:39:53,980
I think I found my niche.

891
00:39:54,182 --> 00:39:55,648
Yeah?

892
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:59,554
Hey.

893
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:01,625
I just wanted to apologize.

894
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,233
I wasn't much of
a T.O. today.

895
00:40:05,005 --> 00:40:06,016
What are you talking about?

896
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:08,090
Everything
was happening so fast.

897
00:40:08,175 --> 00:40:09,789
So if I didn't
slow down and properly...

898
00:40:09,875 --> 00:40:11,250
No, look.

899
00:40:11,818 --> 00:40:13,764
If you repeat this,
I will deny it.

900
00:40:13,849 --> 00:40:16,000
But, um, after today,

901
00:40:16,155 --> 00:40:18,280
you're definitely
my favorite T.O.

902
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:20,588
That's very kind.
You don't have to say that.

903
00:40:20,672 --> 00:40:22,375
No, John, I-I-I mean it.

904
00:40:22,657 --> 00:40:24,367
You know, you...
You teach by asking,

905
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,501
and that's a very
under-appreciated method.

906
00:40:26,585 --> 00:40:28,632
So thanks.

907
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:31,983

Chris called you?

927
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:27,492
Yeah,
which was unexpected.

talk to you.

It's not the right time.

00:41:32,909 --> 00:41:34,626
He's gonna be fine.

931
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,501
You owe it to yourself
to go.

932
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:37,547
I know, but...

933
00:41:37,632 --> 00:41:40,358
What happened to him
isn't your fault.

934
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:42,168
We were about to...

00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,409
We didn't.

937
00:41:48,818 --> 00:41:52,072
Uh, are you trying to get rid of
me as your go-fer?

938
00:41:52,157 --> 00:41:53,592
No.

939
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,311
No, I'm trying to
look out for you.

940
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,643
It's time for you
to move on.

941
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:06,375
And some time away
would be good.

It's a great opportunity, Lucy.

943
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:09,346
Mm-hmm.

944
00:42:09,864 --> 00:42:11,315
