Can you think of anywhere
she might go

543
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:31,847
when she's upset?

544
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,681
<i>I don't know.</i>

545
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,440
<i>I mean, who'd go after Dara?</i>

546
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,890
<i>She's never hurt anyone.</i>

547
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,510
Yeah, I mean, you've made
a lot of powerful enemies.

548
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:39,722
Is there any chance

549
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,170
someone's trying
to get to you through her?

550
00:16:42,311 --> 00:16:43,521
<i>No one would dare.</i>

551
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:45,943
Okay.
Well, if you think of anything.

552
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:47,354
<i>She's a good kid.</i>

553
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:48,349
<i>[sniffs]</i>

554
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,180
<i>She deserves better than...</i>

555
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:53,455
<i>Find her.</i>

556
00:16:53,598 --> 00:16:54,878
Yeah, we're doing
everything we can.

557
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,464
<i>Yeah. Thanks.</i>

558
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,707
How long
till he makes the call?

559
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:01,396
[radio beeps]
<i>- Sergeant, I have the tap</i>

560
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:03,567
<i>on that call
from the prison to Ed Teska.</i>

561
00:17:03,712 --> 00:17:05,202
Patch it through.

562
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:06,544
<i>Where the hell's
my daughter?</i>

563
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,850
<i>Police are telling me
she's missing.</i>

564
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:09,032
<i>Relax.</i>

565
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,676
<i>She's a teenager.
She'll turn up.</i>

566
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,032
<i>When I'm out of here tomorrow,</i>

567
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:13,619
<i>you and I are gonna
have to have a talk.</i>

568
00:17:13,756 --> 00:17:15,686
<i>I'm hearing things,
and I'm not happy.</i>

569
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,167
<i>Stop listening
to the rumors.</i>

570
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:18,312
<i>People are trying
to come between us.</i>

571
00:17:18,451 --> 00:17:19,351
<i>Don't let 'em.</i>

572
00:17:19,486 --> 00:17:20,756
<i>Find my kid.</i>

573
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:21,971
<i>[line clicks]</i>

574
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,180
Well, maybe
Ed's telling the truth.

575
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:24,488
Maybe he doesn't know
where Dara is.

576
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:27,009
Maybe, but he is
a professional liar.

577
00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:29,669
He once had Frank convinced
someone greenlit a hit on him.

578
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:31,667
Had him running
from his shadow.

579
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:33,783
The motel.

580
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:35,024
What?

581
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:36,467
When Frank thought
he'd been greenlit,

582
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:37,987
he told me to take Dara
somewhere safe

583
00:17:38,126 --> 00:17:39,126
while he dealt with it.

584
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:40,915
We stayed at a motel
by the beach.

585
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,100
Maybe she's there.

586
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,683
Okay.

587
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:46,621
So the number Randy gave us
for Emily was a fake.

588
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:48,445
Well, then I'm guessing
her name was fake too.

589
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:50,594
Well, if she is
one of Nelson's victims,

590
00:17:50,724 --> 00:17:52,524
a fake name would make sense.

591
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:54,067
She wouldn't want us
to track her

592
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:55,801
through her online communications.

593
00:17:55,936 --> 00:17:57,796
But then why involve Randy?

594
00:17:57,938 --> 00:17:59,218
To create reasonable doubt?

595
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:01,054
I mean, it wouldn't even
have to be a good frame job

596
00:18:01,183 --> 00:18:02,123
in order for it to work.

597
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:03,533
All her lawyer would have to do

598
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:06,258
is point to the 6'4" German man
found at the crime scene

599
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:08,085
covered in the victim's blood.
[cell phone ringing]

600
00:18:08,225 --> 00:18:09,945
Oh, speaking of.

601
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,089
Huh.

602
00:18:11,987 --> 00:18:13,227
Tell me you are at home.

603
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:15,438
Are you familiar with
the Britney Spears classic

604
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:16,887
"Oops!...I Did It Again"?

605
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:19,056
[sirens wailing]

606
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:20,441
Uh, I have to go.

607
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:22,072
I'll see you
back at the station.

608
00:18:22,204 --> 00:18:23,524
Let me see your hands!

609
00:18:23,654 --> 00:18:25,034
Again.

610
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:26,173
Hey, friends.

611
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,390
Randy, you're making it
very difficult

612
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:31,903
for us to not prosecute you.

613
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,601
I was just trying to help
you guys find the real killer.

614
00:18:34,734 --> 00:18:37,434
If you find a lead,
just text us.

615
00:18:37,564 --> 00:18:40,744
The good news is, we know
that fake Emily's real name

616
00:18:40,878 --> 00:18:42,018
is Ariel Riser.

617
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,255
Uniforms found
$5,000 in cash

618
00:18:44,399 --> 00:18:46,019
in her bedroom,
along with a note

619
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,259
that had your phone number
on it.

620
00:18:47,402 --> 00:18:49,472
Mm, so someone paid her
to frame my client

621
00:18:49,611 --> 00:18:51,031
and then killed her
to cover their tracks?

622
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,684
Yes, that is
what it looks like.

623
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:54,691
But the question is, why Randy?

624
00:18:54,823 --> 00:18:56,033
Was he just a patsy,

625
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:57,689
or does our killer hold
a grudge against him too?

626
00:18:57,826 --> 00:18:59,066
Why would anyone have
a grudge

627
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:00,827
against Skip Tracer Randy?

628
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:02,487
Everybody loves me.
- Right.

629
00:19:02,624 --> 00:19:04,494
But pretending they don't,

630
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,626
why don't you give us a list
of all your bounties

631
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:08,456
and skip traces
from the past five years?

632
00:19:08,595 --> 00:19:09,935
Hopefully, one of the names
on that list

633
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,699
will match one
of Nelson's victims,

634
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,080
and we will have our killer.

635
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:14,771
Great,
and I will start looking

636
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:16,262
at Nelson's social media.

637
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:17,256
No, you will not.

638
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:18,357
You will get us that list,

639
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:19,742
and then you will go home.

640
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:23,652
Randy, as your lawyer,
I'm begging you to stay there.

641
00:19:23,783 --> 00:19:25,093
God, you are no funs.

642
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:26,653
You are zero with the funs.

643
00:19:26,786 --> 00:19:29,266
You're like a monkey
allergic to bananas.

644
00:19:30,065 --> 00:19:31,515
Please remind me
why we had to drive

645
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:33,553
all the way to this
specific coffee cart

646
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:35,519
instead of the one
five minutes from my bed.

647
00:19:35,657 --> 00:19:37,347
Because they have
a liquor license,

648
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:38,556
and it...

649
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:39,704
[quietly] Hi.

650
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,153
Oh, hang on.

651
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:42,533
Please tell me we did not come
all the way here

652
00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:43,874
so you could meet up
with some guy.

653
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,360
What?
We've been chatting online,

654
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:47,504
and he asked if we could meet.

655
00:19:47,634 --> 00:19:49,124
Is that why you came to LA?

656
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:50,837
No!

657
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:51,952
Oh, come on, Bails, please.

658
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:53,157
I need this.

659
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:55,185
- What about your husband?
- Ugh, whatever.

660
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:57,132
Roger's in love
with his physical therapist.

661
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:58,955
[sighs]

662
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:00,964
Okay, fine.
- Yes.

663
00:20:01,096 --> 00:20:02,236
But I'm staying here
with you.

664
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:03,583
I'm not having you get murdered

665
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,689
by some random man
you met on the internet.

666
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:07,645
[squeals] You are the best.

667
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:09,142
Grab us some margaritas?

668
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:14,246
Dara and I stayed here
for a week.

669
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:16,935
We ate junk food,
swam in the ocean,

670
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:18,557
danced on the bed.

671
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,360
I know it doesn't sound
like much,

672
00:20:20,495 --> 00:20:23,045
but when you're spending
every second of the day

673
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:25,807
on high alert, waiting
for it all to go sideways,

674
00:20:25,948 --> 00:20:29,088
it...it feels good
just to breathe.

675
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,538
I get it...

676
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:34,338
'cause I held my breath

677
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:37,274
every time you left
on a long-term assignment.

678
00:20:37,408 --> 00:20:39,378
And then you'd come home, and...

679
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:42,414
And I'd still be gone
in my head,

680
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:45,111
no matter how much
I wanted to be there with you.

681
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:51,151
Anyway, um, so is that escape

682
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,604
why you think
Dara will come here?

683
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,944
[sighs] I don't know.

684
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
I could be projecting.

685
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:57,009
It just...she was scared.

686
00:20:57,152 --> 00:21:00,362
She...she called me
for a reason.

687
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,020
Maybe it's 'cause
this is where she felt safe.

688
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:04,818
Okay, well,
if she does come here,

689
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:06,163
you're gonna need backup,
all right?

690
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,159
You're not a cop anymore...

691
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,470
no gun, no badge...

692
00:21:08,612 --> 00:21:10,442
so Lucy's on her way here.

693
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,999
I can't believe, after
everything I put you through,

694
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:14,893
you're dating another UC.

695
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:15,902
I know.

696
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:17,593
[laughs]

697
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:19,244
But Lucy's different.

698
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:21,141
She isn't a junky in waiting?

699
00:21:22,177 --> 00:21:23,587
You know
that is not what I meant.

700
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,700
I know, I just...

701
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:28,796
seeing you again brings it all
back up, you know?

702
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:30,292
I do.

703
00:21:32,118 --> 00:21:33,598
I still have not
been able to find

704
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,290
a connection between Friske
and Randy.

705
00:21:35,432 --> 00:21:36,302
What about you?

706
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:38,093
Uh, no, but I did make a list

707
00:21:38,227 --> 00:21:39,567
of all the people
that Friske was trolling

708
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,712
who seem most likely
to kill him.

709
00:21:40,851 --> 00:21:41,921
Who's at the top?

710
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,299
Brian Cole.

711
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,930
He is an accountant
from Glendale.

712
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:48,273
Friske hacked Cole's
dead wife's ClipTalk account

713
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,170
to send him taunting messages.

714
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,789
- That's sick.
- Yeah.

715
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:53,521
But he has an airtight alibi.

716
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:54,927
Next on the list are

717
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,872
a chef in Venice
whose restaurant closed

718
00:21:57,005 --> 00:21:58,765
