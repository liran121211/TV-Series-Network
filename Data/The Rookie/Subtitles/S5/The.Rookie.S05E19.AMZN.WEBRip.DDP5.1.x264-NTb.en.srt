<i>Previously on "The Rookie."</i>

2
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:06,083
I read my sister's case file.
My mom lied to me.

3
00:00:06,213 --> 00:00:07,803
<i>I'm here because
I have to do this.</i>

4
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:10,248
Because what happened to me
was so awful

5
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:12,009
I need to make sure it doesn't
happen to anyone else.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,700
Celina's mom had been
in a car accident.

7
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:15,601
Her doctors prescribed opioids.

8
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:17,909
On the day that your sister
was abducted,

9
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:19,712
your mother was buying drugs.

10
00:00:19,847 --> 00:00:22,607
All these years, I mean,
do you have any idea

11
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:24,296
how much I've blamed myself?

12
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:26,508
Hey, you were just a kid.
It wasn't your fault.

13
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:27,857
I know.

14
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:28,893
It was hers.

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,900
[yawns]

16
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,314
Oh, don't you look cozy!

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,970
It's my day off
and I intend to relax.

18
00:00:39,108 --> 00:00:41,008
- You're going to relax?
- Oh, yeah.

19
00:00:41,144 --> 00:00:43,604
Okay, let me translate that
into Bailey.

20
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:45,673
That means you're going to
teach four capoeira classes,

21
00:00:45,804 --> 00:00:47,564
do a 10-mile hike,
run for mayor?

22
00:00:47,702 --> 00:00:50,122
Excuse me, governor.

23
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:52,667
No, I'm doing
absolutely nothing.

24
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:54,231
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

25
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:55,994
I'm gonna read trashy magazines

26
00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,225
and stream '90s sitcoms
and do nothing.

27
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,508
I give the whole thing
20 minutes.

28
00:01:00,646 --> 00:01:02,166
I can do anything
I set my mind to,

29
00:01:02,303 --> 00:01:03,553
even nothing.

30
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:05,104
You go, girl.

31
00:01:05,237 --> 00:01:06,407
It's supposed to be beautiful
this weekend.

32
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:08,479
I was going to power wash
the outdoor furniture.

33
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,690
Oh, I can do that.

34
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:12,659
Oh, you're baiting me.
Nice try.

35
00:01:12,796 --> 00:01:14,826
I'm doing nothing today.
- Sure you are.

36
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:16,941
Listen, if you change your mind
about the governorship,

37
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,007
I'd be honored to be
your first gentleman.

38
00:01:19,148 --> 00:01:21,938
[sighs]

39
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,462
Governor Nune.

<i>♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh,

41
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,810

- Hey.
- Hey.

46
00:01:41,998 --> 00:01:43,548
When did you get in?

47
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,759
Uh, depends.
What day is it?

48
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,208
That bad, huh?

49
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:49,558
Look, I'm...I'm 80% sure
it's...it's Thursday.

50
00:01:49,695 --> 00:01:51,965
It's Tuesday. Yeah.

51
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,182
What were you guys
working on last night?

52
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,050
Uh, murder suspect.
We were there all night.

53
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:56,634
I stayed up anyways.

54
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:58,811
Thought maybe I'd get lucky
and he'd turn himself in.

55
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:01,186
Not quite.
Um, he did show up, though.

56
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:03,358
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

57
00:02:03,502 --> 00:02:05,302
- Oh, babe.
- Yeah.

58
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:07,845
Took on five metro officers?

59
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:09,129
You gotta love that confidence.

60
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,747
Yeah.

61
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:14,958
What's all this?

62
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,410
What?

63
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,690
I'm studying for
the detective's exam.

64
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:20,348
- Since when?
- I didn't tell you?

65
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:22,205
I...no, I don't think so.

66
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:23,829
If I'm gonna work undercover,

67
00:02:23,971 --> 00:02:26,351
the best move is to become
a detective in some division,

68
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:28,701
like intelligence
or narcotics, right?

69
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,218
Right.
So you got the tap.

70
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:32,357
Harper and Lopez
are backing me.

71
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:34,597
All I have to do is score
in the top 12, which...

72
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,230
Which you will.

73
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:37,403
Mm.

74
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,160
Well, I guess
we should get used to

75
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:45,682
not seeing each other so much.

76
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,310
Mm, right.

77
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:50,723
Yeah, between detective's hours
and metro hours...

78
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,170
Hm. It's okay.

79
00:02:53,311 --> 00:02:54,861
We'll figure it out.

80
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:56,902
Yeah, yeah.

81
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,460
Hey, I'm sorry I haven't been
around as much lately.

82
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:05,527
I've been busy.

83
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:07,948
I actually started working on
your case.

84
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:14,061
Well, I...I haven't made
much progress,

85
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:18,724
unless destroying my
relationship with Mom counts.

86
00:03:18,853 --> 00:03:21,623
Look, I know you'd want me
to forgive her, but I...

87
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:23,653
I...I don't...
I don't think I'm ready.

88
00:03:26,654 --> 00:03:29,454
Well, I gotta get to work.

89
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:36,286
<i>Where's Celina?</i>

90
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:37,943
Oh, she's visiting
her sister's grave.

91
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,669
Today's the anniversary of
the day she was taken.

92
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,385
I know. That's what I have to
talk to her about.

93
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:43,051
I found two similar
kidnappings;

94
00:03:43,188 --> 00:03:44,568
one four years after Blanca

95
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:46,257
and another seven years
after that.

96
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:47,918
In every case, the victim was
six years old,

97
00:03:48,055 --> 00:03:49,365
taken while playing outside,

98
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:51,505
and the parent has
a history of substance abuse.

99
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:53,405
That sounds like
a serial killer.

100
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:54,993
But why target the children
of drug addicts?

101
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:56,341
I don't know.

102
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:58,337
And every case happened on
the same day.

103
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,099
Today?

104
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,450
I'll handle it.
Thank you very much.

105
00:04:04,727 --> 00:04:06,517
Is that the sign-up list
for the detective's exam?

106
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,490
It is. Two weeks to go.

107
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:10,627
- I'll be ready.
- I have no doubt.

108
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:13,217
Brave move, Chen.

109
00:04:14,978 --> 00:04:16,328
I don't know about that.

110
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:18,053
I think it's the next step
for me.

111
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:20,878
Sure, but you'll never make
top 12.

112
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,539
What is that
supposed to mean?

113
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:24,436
One of the detectives
has it out for you.

114
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:26,344
So no matter how well you do
on the written,

115
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:27,853
they're gonna sink you
on the oral.

116
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:30,621
What? Who?

117
00:04:30,753 --> 00:04:32,133
I don't know.

118
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,172
Good luck.

119
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:37,969
- Is he right?
- Rarely.

120
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:40,555
But I will ask around,
see if there's any truth to it.

121
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:42,074
Thanks.

122
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:47,285
<i>He abducted more kids?</i>

123
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:48,695
<i>Two, that we know of.</i>

124
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,570
And on the same day
as your sister.

125
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:52,534
That's today.
Okay, that's creepy.

126
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,051
So there could be another one today.

127
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,360
Or not.

128
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:57,752
Right.

129
00:04:57,883 --> 00:05:00,063
You know, I...I visited
her grave this morning,

130
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:03,366
and she wasn't there.

131
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,990
I know you think that's crazy.

132
00:05:05,132 --> 00:05:08,792
That aside, why do you think
she wasn't there?

133
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:10,929
I don't know.

134
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,549
But lately she's felt so, like,
far away.

135
00:05:13,692 --> 00:05:16,322
And I don't know
what's changed.

136
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:18,664
<i>7-Adam-15,
we have a possible 207</i>

137
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:21,291
<i>at 9215 Detroit Street.</i>

138
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:23,434
- It's a kidnapping.
- Possible kidnapping.

139
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:25,264
7-Adam-15, show us responding.

140
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,784
I can take the lead on this.
- No, I'm good.

141
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:29,023
You know,
when Blanca was taken,

142
00:05:29,156 --> 00:05:30,736
there were dozens of cops.

143
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:32,262
And most of them were terrifying,

144
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:34,921
but there was one that
made me feel like

145
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:37,338
everything was going to be Okay.

146
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:41,855
I want to be that person
for someone else.

147
00:05:43,032 --> 00:05:45,242
Maybe it's Carradine.

148
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,799
I called him out for stealing
my lunches from the fridge.

149
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:49,383
Okay, and you think
he's that petty?

150
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:51,391
Maybe. I...
[groans]

151
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:53,213
Who do you think it is?
- I think,

152
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,533
and stay with me on this one...
- Mm-hmm?

153
00:05:55,665 --> 00:05:58,355
Maybe you shouldn't believe
everything Smitty says

154
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:00,426
or anything Smitty says.

155
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:02,287
Yeah, but what if
he is right?

156
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:04,741
The oral part of the exam is
so subjective.

157
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:07,021
If even one person on the panel
has it out for me,

158
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,539
it'll tank my score.

159
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:11,158
Yeah, I never expected
a police station

160
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:13,651
to be so much like high school.
- I know.

161
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:16,647
Except, I mean,
now I'm one of the cool kids.

162
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,246
It's him. It's the same guy.

163
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,836
I don't...we don't know that.

164
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:29,423
Most of the time
they're playing somewhere.

165
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:30,911
We find them in minutes.
- No, that's not what this is.

166
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:32,555
I can feel it.

167
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:33,952
- Did you find her?
- No, ma'am.

168
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:36,573
We have to find her!
She's six. She's scared.

169
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:38,286
We know. That's why we're
here.

170
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:39,922
We just need a few details.
- What details?

171
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,684
My daughter is missing.
I said that on the phone!

172
00:06:41,815 --> 00:06:43,365
Okay, maybe you can
let us inside,

173
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:44,506
and we can help you look.
- She's not inside.

174
00:06:44,645 --> 00:06:46,505
I looked.
She was playing outside.

He's calling everyone.

Her name's Olivia.

That's a really pretty name.

00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:08,666
How about I help you find
a photo of her?

189

Yeah.

- Nolan.
- Here we are.

We turned the house
upside down,

We're widening the search.

- Security cameras?
- We got what we can.

A lot of people aren't home.

- It's him, isn't it?
- We don't know that.

but you cannot leap
to conclusions.

201

I mean, it's the anniversary.

202
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:37,525
She's six years old,
taken from her front yard.

What was that?

00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:46,494
Per the terms of
your probation,

351
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:47,937
you're not allowed to own
children's toys.

352
00:12:48,077 --> 00:12:49,147
This is harassment!

353
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:50,145
I think you two should leave.

354
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,356
Sit down.

355
00:12:52,495 --> 00:12:53,875
Now.

356
00:12:54,014 --> 00:12:56,124
Do not move,
do not touch anything,

357
00:12:56,258 --> 00:12:59,778
or you will be in violation of
your probation.

358
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:01,127
7-Adam-7.

359
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:04,543
We need additional units
to 7858 West Cedar.

360
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,240
Detectives.

361
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:09,553
You have a minute?
- What's up?

362
00:13:09,685 --> 00:13:11,135
Earlier today,
an officer dropped by.

363
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:13,143
He worked Blanca's case
back in the day.

364
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:15,375
According to Celina,
he visited constantly.

365
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:17,208
- A little overinvolved?
- Maybe.

366
00:13:17,348 --> 00:13:19,248
And today,
he tried to get inside

367
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:21,154
the crime scene's
inner perimeter.

368
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:23,043
Maybe these kinds of cases
hit home for him

369
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:24,421
and he wants to help.

370
00:13:24,562 --> 00:13:26,362
Or maybe he wanted
an excuse for his DNA

371
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:28,045
to be at the scene.

372
00:13:28,186 --> 00:13:29,666
I looked into him.
He had a daughter,

373
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,709
lost custody of her
when she was six years old.

374
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,225
The same age as
the missing girls.

375
00:13:33,364 --> 00:13:35,754
And today was
his daughter's birthday.

376
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,919
[helicopter whirring]

377
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,230
Look, I know it's not
a slam dunk, but I think

378
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:43,622
it deserves a closer look.
Nolan is right.

379
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:45,553
There's something off
about Officer Chambers.

380
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:46,756
How do you want to proceed?

381
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:48,065
Joel's been on duty
all morning.

382
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:49,516
We want to check
his shop's GPS,

383
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:51,236
see if he went anywhere
near her house.

384
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:52,942
He has a history with
Olivia's family.

385
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:54,803
I can bring him in
under the guise of

386
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:56,767
needing background intel.
<i>- Good.</i>

387
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:58,765
The minute he realizes
he's a suspect,

388
00:13:58,907 --> 00:14:00,627
he'll ask for his reps
and shut down.

389
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,080
Lucy and Aaron
have a new suspect.

390
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,880
I'll check in with them
and report back.

391
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:05,045
All right. Keep me posted.

392
00:14:08,157 --> 00:14:09,747
Do you see that?

393
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:12,373
Harper and Lopez are making
secret calls in their car.

394
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:15,096
They'll update us when
they get something concrete.

395
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:16,273
You know what's going on.

396
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:17,547
If you're keeping
something from me

397
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:19,444
because you think
I'm too close to the case,

398
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:21,272
please don't.

399
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:24,762
How well do you know Joel?

400
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,798
Yeah, we've kept in touch.
Why?

401
00:14:26,935 --> 00:14:28,445
Does he ever talk about
his daughter,

402
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:30,041
the one he lost custody of
when she was six?

403
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:33,769
No.

404
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,287
Wait. You...you don't...

405
00:14:36,427 --> 00:14:37,497
you don't think he did this?

406
00:14:37,635 --> 00:14:40,155
Did you know today is
her birthday?

407
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:42,163
So you think...what,

408
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:45,945
he just takes these girls
to replace her?

409
00:14:46,092 --> 00:14:47,582
Maybe. It's a theory.

410
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:49,344
No, it's a coincidence.

411
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:50,514
Maybe that's why
he gets involved,

412
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:52,098
because it reminds him of her.

413
00:14:52,236 --> 00:14:54,266
Okay, I know this is hard
for you to hear...

414
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,000
Hard to hear?

415
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:58,656
He's the reason I'm a cop...
because of him.

416
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:02,004
Listen, you're wrong,
and he didn't do this.

417
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,150
- Find anything?
- No sign of Olivia.

418
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:12,599
He could have built
all sorts of hidden areas

419
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:14,149
over the years.
We need dogs and infrared.

420
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:15,852
Already requested.

421
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:20,134
Mr. Heslov,
I'm Detective Lopez.

422
00:15:20,264 --> 00:15:22,514
Does the name Olivia Vargas
mean anything to you?

423
00:15:22,645 --> 00:15:24,985
That's what all this
is about?

424
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:25,961
You think I did
something to her?

425
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:26,997
Answer the question.

426
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:29,143
Have you ever met
Olivia Vargas?

427
00:15:29,273 --> 00:15:32,863
Ah, it's hard to say.
A picture might jog my memory.

428
00:15:33,001 --> 00:15:34,551
Yes or no.

429
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:38,522
Come on.
Give me a few details.

430
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:41,631
We are going to
turn this house inside out.

431
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:44,358
If we so much as find a hair
that doesn't belong here,

432
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:45,945
you're going to prison.

433
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,123
Do you need details on that,

434
00:15:47,256 --> 00:15:48,396
or do you remember
what it's like

435
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,743
to be a pedophile behind bars?

436
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:58,060
These cases are the worst,
just every parent's nightmare.

437
00:15:58,198 --> 00:15:59,788
You have kids?
- Yeah, a daughter.

438
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:00,994
Losing her would destroy me.

439
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:03,512
So if you need any help,
I'm here.

440
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:05,792
He's wearing different shoes.

441
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:06,720
Are you sure?

442
00:16:06,862 --> 00:16:08,142
I am.

443
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:09,377
His other ones had
a zipper on the side,

444
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,940
so they don't have to be tied.

445
00:16:11,073 --> 00:16:13,083
Yeah, he saw that we found
a shoe print at the scene.

446
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:14,353
Probably threw the old ones
in the LA river.

447
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,910
I mean, or his old ones were uncomfortable,

448
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:17,564
or Nolan's wrong.

449
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,430
Celina, I'm aware
of the history.

450
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:21,194
But if you can't examine
the facts objectively...

451
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:22,905
Sorry. I'm...I'm good.

452
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:24,501
Joel was called
to Olivia's house

453
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:25,808
several times before
the abduction.

454
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,230
He was also called to

455
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:28,945
the second and third victims'
homes.

456
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:32,681
We gotta know if Blanca fits
the same pattern.

457
00:16:32,819 --> 00:16:33,889
Bring Carla in.

458
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,057
Let's see what she remembers.

459
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:36,621
There's no record of
an arrest

460
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:38,104
or any sort of calls made to
our house.

461
00:16:38,238 --> 00:16:39,578
And only your mom knows
for sure.

462
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:42,282
We'll find out.

463
00:16:42,415 --> 00:16:43,895
According to the logs,

464
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,687
Joel was at a premise check
at a warehouse

465
00:16:45,832 --> 00:16:47,082
at the time of the abduction.

466
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:49,913
GPS on the shop says that
he was there 30 minutes.

467
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:51,463
How far is the warehouse
from Olivia's house?

468
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,596
Far enough
he would have to drive.

469
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:54,836
Or maybe he had
a car stashed there.

470
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:56,079
Look, I can go to the location,

471
00:16:56,222 --> 00:16:57,532
drive the route from
Olivia's and back,

472
00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:58,641
see if it even works.

473
00:16:58,776 --> 00:16:59,736
- Keep me updated.
- Yeah.

474
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,810
So according to the file,

475
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,371
you answered a 415 at
Olivia's house.

476
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:06,397
That's right.
It was about a month ago.

477
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:07,852
The neighbor called it in.

478
00:17:07,992 --> 00:17:09,302
Olivia's mom was kicking out

479
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:12,132
her most recent
deadbeat boyfriend.

480
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:14,212
Yeah, we are actually
looking into him.

481
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:16,143
And did you see Olivia?

482
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:18,546
Yeah, she was
hiding in a corner.

483
00:17:18,692 --> 00:17:19,832
Pretty badly shaken.

484
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:21,629
She begged me not to
take her mom away.

485
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:24,254
- And you didn't?
- No signs of abuse.

486
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:25,628
There wasn't much I could do
but refer them

487
00:17:25,768 --> 00:17:27,738
to Child Protective Services.

488
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:29,814
You ask me,

489
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:32,215
we're far too lenient
with parents.

490
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:34,611
You'll get no argument
from me there.

491
00:17:34,743 --> 00:17:35,883
CPS is overwhelmed.

492
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,400
Even when there's abuse,

493
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:40,089
the parents get them back
half the time.

494
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:41,371
It is maddening.

495
00:17:41,508 --> 00:17:43,508
I mean, so many deserving
parents out there

496
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:45,958
just struggling through
the adoption process.

497
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,999
Exactly.

498
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:52,416
You also participated in
the search for Celina's sister?

499
00:17:52,554 --> 00:17:53,564
Is that right?

500
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:55,143
It is.

501
00:17:55,281 --> 00:17:57,351
Why? You don't think
the two cases are related?

502
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,180
Oh, it's just an avenue
we're exploring.

503
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,840
[exhales heavily]

504
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:05,709
Oh.

505
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:08,023
I really need to get home.
My birds are...

506
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:11,016
I know, okay,
but this is important.

507
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:12,639
We'll get you home
just as soon as we can.

508
00:18:12,781 --> 00:18:14,231
We just need to know

509
00:18:14,369 --> 00:18:16,679
if you remember meeting
an Officer Joel Chambers.

510
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:18,339
Of course.

511
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:19,786
He was very helpful.

512
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:21,886
He...he still checks in on me
years later.

513
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:24,931
And when did you
first meet him?

514
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:26,449
[sighs]

515
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:27,968
It was such a long time ago.

516
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,207
<i>Mami,</i> I need you
to tell me everything,

517
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:33,351
no matter how upsetting.

518
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:35,841
There were so many
police officers around.

519
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:38,116
Okay, so you met him
after Blanca was taken?

520
00:18:38,255 --> 00:18:39,495
- I guess so.
<i>- Mami!</i>

521
00:18:39,635 --> 00:18:42,045
Celina.

522
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,990
<i>[soft tense music]</i>

523
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,924
Look... I get it.

524
00:18:49,058 --> 00:18:50,848
I...I used to think

00:41:42,189 --> 00:41:44,879
Oh, I'm sorry I can't let you
get any rest tonight.

1057
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:46,259
I have plans for you.

1058
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

1059
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:54,440
So settle in for
a nice, long night of...

1060
00:41:54,581 --> 00:41:56,861
catching up on "The Bachelor."

1061
00:41:56,997 --> 00:41:59,717
Oh, there's gonna be
limo arrivals

1062
00:41:59,862 --> 00:42:03,182
and rose ceremonies.

1063
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,973
Sadly, lots of crying.

1064
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:10,008
For every dream realized,
a hope will be dashed.

1065
00:42:10,148 --> 00:42:12,528
Honey?

1066
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:13,808
Baby?
