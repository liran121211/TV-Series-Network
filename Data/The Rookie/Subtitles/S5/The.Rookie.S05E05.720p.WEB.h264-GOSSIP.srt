1
00:00:01,346 --> 00:00:03,615
All right.
Now turn right.

2
00:00:05,016 --> 00:00:06,716
Are you sure
you were born in March?

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,619
Oh, I think she knows what month
she was born in.

4
00:00:09,653 --> 00:00:11,455
Who are you, little one?

5
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:14,057
Are you here of
your own free will,

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,559
or are you a droid
locked in servitude?

7
00:00:16,593 --> 00:00:18,428
She doesn't even know
what planet she's on.

8
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:20,530
Okay, that's fair.
But the state of California

9
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:22,832
did require her to show
her birth certificate

10
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:24,077
when she got
that driver's license.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,536
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just saying...

12
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:28,105
You know, Pisces are normally
way too gentle

13
00:00:28,138 --> 00:00:30,507
to go on a drunken
vandalism spree.

14
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,076
There's nothing normal about
the people we interact with.

15
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:37,046
You are destined for more
than this, little one.

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,116
Do you want to know a secret?

17
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:43,520
I'm not really
Danielle Vonderclomp.

18
00:00:43,554 --> 00:00:46,689
My parents adopted me
from a Lithuanian orphanage

19
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:48,225
when I was 2.

20
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:51,328
My history,
shrouded in darkness.

21
00:00:51,362 --> 00:00:54,030
I believe that I am
secretly a princess

22
00:00:54,064 --> 00:00:57,901
destined to go back home
one day to rule.

23
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,270
Okay, I'm sorry.

24
00:00:59,302 --> 00:01:01,036
Your Highness, are you saying

25
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,340
your parents just made up
a birthday for you?

26
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:05,376
Well, duh.

27
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,387
I told you so.
Please don't.

28
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:09,879
She's a Leo, for sure.
I said don't.

29
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,188
Have you seen my hair tie?

30
00:01:18,222 --> 00:01:19,555
Nightstand.

31
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,225
I swear I looked here.

32
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:23,760
So, today's the day?

33
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,162
It is. And...?

34
00:01:26,197 --> 00:01:28,599
And... great.

35
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:32,335
You think I'm going
back to work too soon?

36
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,105
I voiced my opinion,
and I respect your decision.

37
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,941
Right. It's just that...

38
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:40,075
Well, technically,
you were dead.

39
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:42,912
I mean, you were gone,
and they brought you back.

40
00:01:42,945 --> 00:01:44,448
I just think maybe it might

41
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,750
take you more than a week
to get past that.

42
00:01:46,783 --> 00:01:49,019
Yeah, but it's not like
that's the first time.

43
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:51,754
Sure, but...
Whoa, wait. What?

44
00:01:51,787 --> 00:01:53,122
You've been dead before?

45
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,557
I knew
this was a bad idea.

46
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:56,668
We should've used a service
to cover Justine's vacation.

47
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:58,371
Your mom just wants
to spend more time with Jack.

48
00:01:58,395 --> 00:02:00,364
Why hire a temp nanny
when he's got family?

49
00:02:00,397 --> 00:02:02,698
Because a nanny
would be on time.

50
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:05,335
I have to go.
Can you stay until she shows?

51
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:07,237
Yeah. Go.

52
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:11,074
Mami!

53
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:12,175
Huh?

54
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,576
Call 911!

55
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,381
We should let Marshall
pick every restaurant

56
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:19,550
for all the sergeant's meetings.

57
00:02:19,582 --> 00:02:21,252
Did you try that
breakfast sandwich?

58
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:23,454
No. Ashley's got me on
this Whole30 thing.

59
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:24,587
No bread.

60
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:27,056
Oh, you're missing out.
Hey, Smitty.

61
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,391
Yeah, Sarge?

62
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:30,561
You can't park your
personal vehicle in spots

63
00:02:30,593 --> 00:02:32,396
designated for marked units.

64
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:35,665
The RV isn't my vehicle,
it's my house.

65
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:38,502
#VanLife.

66
00:02:38,534 --> 00:02:40,537
You can't park your house
in marked spots either.

67
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,042
Any chance he retires soon?

68
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:48,078
You aren't that lucky.

69
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,848
Okay.
She needs a couple stitches,

70
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:53,384
and I'd like to admit her,

71
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:56,051
get a CAT scan to make sure
nothing more serious presents.

72
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:57,388
Of course.

73
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,622
Thank you, Doctor.

74
00:02:58,655 --> 00:02:59,389
Are you single?

75
00:02:59,423 --> 00:03:00,623
Mom!

76
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:01,925
Because I have four sons.

77
00:03:01,957 --> 00:03:03,326
One's a priest,

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,096
but the others could use
a successful, young,

79
00:03:06,128 --> 00:03:08,031
beautiful woman like yourself.

80
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:09,865
That's sweet, but I'm engaged.

81
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,168
Oh, congratulations.

82
00:03:12,201 --> 00:03:13,836
You let me know
if it doesn't work out.

83
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,239
Sure thing.

84
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:18,108
Mom.

85
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,885
I need you to tell me what happened.
I'm fine.

86
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,745
Where's my grandbaby?
At home with Wesley.

87
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:23,212
Well, let's go see them.

88
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:25,115
The doctors are overreacting.

89
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:27,350
You're not leaving
until they clear you.

90
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:30,120
I once worked an eight-hour
shift with a broken wrist.

91
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:31,354
Last time I heard that story,

92
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:33,524
it was a six-hour shift
with a sprain.

93
00:03:33,557 --> 00:03:35,759
Point is, I'm tougher
than I look.

94
00:03:35,792 --> 00:03:37,394
I know how tough you are,

95
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:39,194
but I need you
to tell me what happened.

96
00:03:39,228 --> 00:03:40,228
Nothing.

97
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:43,667
I don't want to freak you out.

98
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,668
I'm a cop. Nothing freaks me out.

99
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:49,506
I was on my way to see you
when a big man grabbed me.

100
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:52,275
I whacked him with my purse.
He threw me down.

101
00:03:52,308 --> 00:03:53,610
What aren't you telling me?

102
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:54,644
Nothing.

103
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,082
I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.
Mom.

104
00:04:00,116 --> 00:04:02,618
"Tell your son
he's out of time."

105
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:03,954
Out of time for what?

106
00:04:03,986 --> 00:04:05,355
I don't know.
That's all he said.

107
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:07,257
Which son?
I don't know!

108
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:11,562
It has to be a misunderstanding.

109
00:04:11,594 --> 00:04:13,896
Your brothers
are all such good boys.

110
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,098
My brothers used to
stuff me in a pillowcase

111
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,377
and drag me around
the neighborhood.

112
00:04:17,401 --> 00:04:19,836
And look how tough it made you.

113
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,870
They did you a favor.

114
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,274
What's with all these diets
Ashley has you on?

115
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,709
Her dad's having heart trouble.

116
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:29,545
Burglary. 10:00.

117
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,850
Control, 7-Adam-100,
we got a burglary in progress.

118
00:04:33,884 --> 00:04:36,052
4-9-1-9-2 Figueroa.

119
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:38,120
Send additional units.

120
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:42,334
Hey! Show me your hands!
Foot pursuit. White adult male.

121
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:44,226
Black hoodie,
jeans, headed south.

122
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:50,567
Get off of me!

123
00:04:51,735 --> 00:04:53,937
It's okay.
I got it, I got it.

124
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,781
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

125
00:04:55,805 --> 00:04:57,115
Just, uh, tweaked my back
on the takedown.

126
00:04:58,442 --> 00:05:00,242
Oh!

127
00:05:00,276 --> 00:05:02,446
You're not fine. You're in agony.
Oh!

128
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:03,755
We're taking you
to the hospital.

129
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,259
What happened?

130
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:18,595
He must have been going
at least 70.

131
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:21,564
Lost control, hit a couple
parked cars, flipped.

132
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:22,832
Several deep lacerations.

133
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,401
Possible internal bleeding.

134
00:05:24,435 --> 00:05:26,502
Uh, don't move.

135
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,271
It's stuck again.
Here. I'll pinch.

136
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:29,072
You lift.

137
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:32,207
Got it.

138
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:35,678
...three, up!

139
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,711
All right.

140
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,749
Headed to Saint Stephen.

141
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:40,050
All right.

142
00:05:42,252 --> 00:05:43,620
And what do we do next?

143
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:45,521
We, uh, wait for backup
to secure the scene,

144
00:05:45,555 --> 00:05:47,591
then head to the hospital.
Why?

145
00:05:47,624 --> 00:05:49,992
Well, a death investigation
triggers different protocols.

146
00:05:50,026 --> 00:05:51,862
We go with the victim
in case he dies.

147
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,196
Nicely done.

148
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,665
How's your mom?

149
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:57,701
Okay, I think.

150
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,437
She keeps going on about
how it was a misunderstanding.

151
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:02,439
Uh, you think one of
your brothers is in trouble?

152
00:06:02,473 --> 00:06:04,173
It wouldn't be the first time.

153
00:06:04,206 --> 00:06:05,752
If one of them is a reason
for Mom's attack,

154
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:07,677
I will rain down
hell's own fury.

155
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:10,180
Okay. So, technically,
this can't be your case.

156
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:12,682
I know. It's your case.
I'm not even here.

157
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:15,218
Good, because it's
a major conflict of interest

158
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,553
for you to investigate
your own brothers.

159
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:18,788
I know.
Plus, if I do it,

160
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:19,689
I might end up
killing one of them.

161
00:06:19,723 --> 00:06:21,091
Huh.

162
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:22,925
And here they come now.

163
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,661
That's Damian,
my oldest brother.

164
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:28,531
Also known as Father Lopez
or Father D.

165
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:30,365
Amen to that.

166
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,944
He started a nonprofit
teaching job skills

167
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:33,704
to former gang members,

168
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:36,406
so he's got just as many friends
as he does enemies.

169
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,875
And that's
Benjamin "Benny" Lopez.

170
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:40,776
Second oldest.

171
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,278
He was Gordon Gekko for Halloween
from the time he was 3.

172
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:45,682
When he was 12,
he opened an investment account

173
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:47,117
using lawnmower earnings

174
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:49,084
and our abuelita's
Social Security number.

175
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,786
Her portfolio
is better than mine.

176
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:53,423
And that's Cruz.
Middle child.

177
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,191
In and out of rehab
since he was 18.

178
00:06:55,225 --> 00:06:57,694
Just can't seem
to get it together.

179
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:00,262
When I became a cop, my mom made
me promise to never arrest him.

180
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,865
I thought you had four brothers.

181
00:07:01,898 --> 00:07:03,098
Bruno's the youngest,

182
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,375
but he's been in New York
since college.

183
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,036
I really don't think
he's involved.

184
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:07,838
Angela, what's going on?

185
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,204
Mom's in the hospital.

186
00:07:09,238 --> 00:07:10,606
She okay?
Wait. What happened?

187
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:11,884
Well, why didn't you have us
meet there?

188
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:13,185
Your mother was
attacked this morning

189
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:14,877
on her way to Angela's house.

190
00:07:14,911 --> 00:07:16,547
She suffered a blow to the head.

191
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:18,014
The doctors are
running some tests.

192
00:07:18,048 --> 00:07:19,214
Who would attack Mom?

193
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:20,391
Hold on.
Is that why we're here?

194
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:22,185
What, you think it's our fault?

195
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:24,687
The assailant said, "Tell your
son he's running out of time."

196
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:26,689
So, yeah, I think one of you
is at fault,

197
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:28,759
and no one's leaving
until I get answers.

198
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:31,161
All right, if one of you
wants to make this easy

199
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:34,029
and just confess,
that would be awesome.

200
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:38,367
All right, then.
Hard way it is.

201
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:41,036
Come on.

202
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:42,872
Really?

203
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:49,278
What is this?

204
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,449
I'm just gonna move you
real fast.

205
00:07:56,752 --> 00:07:58,622
That's an exit wound.

206
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,593
Control, Engine 53.

207
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,060
Advise Saint Stephen
we have a gunshot victim.

208
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:08,098
ETA six minutes,
and advise PD we have a GSW.

209
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,500
Oh! Calm down, buddy.

210
00:08:10,533 --> 00:08:11,543
We're almost at the hospital.
Oh!

211
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:12,903
It's gonna be okay.

212
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:23,913
I thought I fixed it.

213
00:08:23,947 --> 00:08:25,247
It's fine.
You hold pressure.

214
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:26,360
I'll go get another gurney.

215
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:37,427
No!

216
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,524
Greg!

217
00:09:13,363 --> 00:09:14,764
What happened?

218
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:16,732
Our patient must've attacked him.
Why?

219
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,669
I found a gunshot wound
when I was cleaning him up.

220
00:09:19,702 --> 00:09:20,746
He would know the hospital
would have to report

221
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,005
that gunshot to the police.

222
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,274
He's gone inside the hospital.

223
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:25,741
We need to lock it down now.

224
00:09:34,817 --> 00:09:36,119
Security guard.

225
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:38,421
Hi. John Nolan.

226
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,456
Jasper Lee.
Hospital's locked down.

227
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,192
All incoming calls
are being rerouted.

228
00:09:42,225 --> 00:09:43,568
Okay, we're gonna have to
post up at all the exits,

229
00:09:43,592 --> 00:09:45,161
check everyone's I.D.
before they leave.

230
00:09:45,195 --> 00:09:46,504
Does that mean you've got
an I.D. on this guy?

231
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:48,530
Rob Lukasey.
He left his wallet in the car.

232
00:09:48,563 --> 00:09:50,232
A laundry list of priors.

233
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:53,003
- Uh, Celina, can you get him
a photo to distribute? - Will do.

234
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:54,336
He's in bad shape.

235
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,338
His first priority will be
patching himself up.

236
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:57,515
Well, we can put extra security

237
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:58,784
on the pharmacy
and storage rooms.

238
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,844
But the truth is,

239
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,388
there's medical supplies
everywhere in here.

240
00:10:02,412 --> 00:10:03,913
I got more officers
coming to help,

241
00:10:03,947 --> 00:10:04,880
but I'm sure I don't
have to tell you

242
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:06,057
what a big job this is gonna be.

243
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:08,751
8 floors, 600 beds,
34 operating rooms.

244
00:10:08,784 --> 00:10:10,754
In our simulations,
a thorough search

245
00:10:10,787 --> 00:10:11,754
takes five hours.

246
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:12,554
Hmm.
Well, let's get to it.

247
00:10:12,587 --> 00:10:13,756
Let's do it.

248
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:14,924
Okay.

249
00:10:14,957 --> 00:10:16,658
Agh. Nolan.

250
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:17,727
You all right?

251
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,861
Yeah, uh, fine.

252
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:20,363
What... What's
the lockdown status?

253
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:22,274
Uh, we got, uh, everything
checked off the list, but...

254
00:10:22,298 --> 00:10:24,576
No, call Grey and tell him
Tim is not here as a supervisor.

255
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,869
He's here as a patient.

256
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:28,538
I told you, I'm fine. Agh!
Oh, my God.

257
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:29,940
Ohh, okay.

258
00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:31,506
Okay, I'm not fine.

259
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,743
Get me a doctor.

260
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:36,913
"Tell your son
he's out of time."

261
00:10:36,947 --> 00:10:38,347
Any idea what that means?

262
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,116
No. No. If I did,
I would tell you.

263
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,886
Ask him about his record.

264
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,788
I was getting to that.

265
00:10:45,822 --> 00:10:48,158
So, you got a couple arrests
for public intoxication

266
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,226
and multiple DUIs.
Ancient history.

267
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,996
I've been sober for one year
and 47 days today.

268
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:57,399
Whoa.
What are you doing here?

269
00:10:57,432 --> 00:10:59,068
I'm representing my client.

270
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,671
What?

271
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,538
Hey, Ange.

272
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:06,442
You're not even a defense attorney anymore.
Look, I know.

273
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:08,254
This is my chance to get one
of your brothers to like me.

274
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:09,879
They're never gonna like you.

275
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:11,614
Objection... argumentative.

276
00:11:11,647 --> 00:11:13,783
Your mother-in-law is
in the hospital right now

277
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:15,751
because of him.
Objection... speculation.

278
00:11:15,785 --> 00:11:17,187
All right. Enough.

279
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,288
You, sit down.
Yeah.

280
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:20,023
You, go back inside.

281
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:20,791
All right.

282
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:25,561
That was dope.
Yeah.

283
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:26,996
Can we get back on track?

284
00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:28,197
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

285
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,599
Look, I've been trying
to tell you,

286
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:32,001
that last DUI was the best thing
to happen to me.

287
00:11:32,034 --> 00:11:33,602
I've been clean and sober
ever since.

288
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:36,405
I understand you work with
a lot of ex-cons.

289
00:11:36,438 --> 00:11:38,841
Guilt by association.
Really, Detective?

290
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,676
It's all right.

291
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,913
My mission is to help people
get out of the gang life.

292
00:11:42,946 --> 00:11:45,881
What if one of the gangs
got tired of you interfering

293
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:47,884
and decided to send a message?

294
00:11:47,918 --> 00:11:50,220
By attacking my mother?

295
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:52,288
No.

296
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:54,224
The people that I work with,

297
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:55,366
they might not
always agree with me,

298
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,260
but they respect the collar.

299
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:00,495
Even if they didn't,
they know my sister's a cop.

300
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:01,673
So if it's not because of you,

301
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:04,267
which brother do you think
I should be focused on?

302
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,701
Cruz, Clearly.

303
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:07,437
Uh, sorry.

304
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,706
I just need to respond to this.

305
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,352
As I was saying...

306
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:19,390
A thousand apologies.
Uh...

307
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:24,086
It never ends. Uh...

308
00:12:25,754 --> 00:12:27,322
Sorry.
No, you're not.

309
00:12:27,356 --> 00:12:30,994
Uh, what exactly is
your business, Mr. Lopez?

310
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:32,595
Um...

311
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,230
- I...
- Okay.

312
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:37,232
Hey, while I have you here,

313
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:39,501
Angela's been dragging her feet.

314
00:12:39,534 --> 00:12:40,879
We really gotta get
baby Jack baptized.

315
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:42,838
No, you know, I just...

316
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:45,283
I don't really want to get in the middle of...
of what you guys have...

317
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,277
Well, I know.
I know you're not Catholic.

318
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:48,577
What's your denomination?

319
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:52,548
Protestant?

320
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:53,625
I don't know.
Is that even an option?

321
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:54,918
No.

322
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:56,552
Oh.

323
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:58,288
I'm gonna go with Episcopalian.
Sure.

324
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,023
Look, I get it.
Your line of work,

325
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:02,225
there is
a lot of money at stake.

326
00:13:02,258 --> 00:13:04,826
Might drive a person
to violence.

327
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,429
The guys I work with, they're not gonna
beat up someone's mom.

328
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:09,764
That's too kind.

329
00:13:09,798 --> 00:13:12,034
They'll just sue you to death.

330
00:13:14,303 --> 00:13:16,239
Can I just answer that one...
Mnh-mnh.

331
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:19,042
Ask him about his credit report.

332
00:13:19,075 --> 00:13:22,177
I was getting to that.

333
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:24,379
So, we ran your credit report,

334
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:26,581
and we saw that
you took out a $15,000 loan.

335
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,250
You wanna tell us about that?

336
00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:29,427
You don't have to answer that.

337
00:13:29,451 --> 00:13:31,386
Yes, he does.

338
00:13:31,421 --> 00:13:33,623
The loan is for college classes.

339
00:13:33,655 --> 00:13:35,424
I'm getting my bachelor's
in accounting.

340
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:36,835
I didn't want to
say anything in case

341
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,227
I couldn't hack it

342
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,063
because I know
what you think of me.

343
00:13:41,096 --> 00:13:42,764
And I know I screwed up a lot.

344
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:44,210
I know you have no reason
to trust me.

345
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:47,102
But whatever's going on,
it's not me.

346
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,076
Clear on floor two.

347
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:55,411
Floor three clear.
Heading to four.

348
00:13:55,445 --> 00:13:57,246
Okay. Thank you.

349
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,749
Well, our suspect
killed a woman this morning.

350
00:13:59,782 --> 00:14:01,384
Home invasion in West Hollywood.

351
00:14:01,417 --> 00:14:03,385
The victim's husband
managed to get the gun

352
00:14:03,418 --> 00:14:05,721
away from the suspect
and shoot him as he escaped.

353
00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:07,698
Okay, so he's looking at
life in prison if we catch him.

354
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,491
When we catch him.

355
00:14:09,524 --> 00:14:11,027
God, I hate hospitals.

356
00:14:11,061 --> 00:14:11,995
Doesn't everyone?

357
00:14:12,028 --> 00:14:13,663
Yeah, I guess.

358
00:14:13,696 --> 00:14:14,830
Hey.
How's your partner?

359
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:16,365
Shattered cheekbone.

360
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,832
Plastic surgeon's on his way in.

361
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,101
You're going back to work?

362
00:14:19,134 --> 00:14:20,611
I'll wait until he's out of surgery.
Right.

363
00:14:20,635 --> 00:14:21,903
I just found out this morning

364
00:14:21,937 --> 00:14:23,605
Bailey has been dead
more than once.

365
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:25,274
I know.

366
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:26,708
I felt it when I first met her.

367
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,111
One had something to do with,
uh, flying?

368
00:14:29,144 --> 00:14:30,947
Wow. Yeah.

369
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,782
A-A-A halo jump went sideways.

370
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,852
This is Nolan,
fourth floor west.

371
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:39,922
We just found
the suspect's bloody clothes.

372
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:42,491
Looks like he tried to patch
himself up best he could.

373
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:44,494
Right, and then changed
into some scrubs.

374
00:14:44,527 --> 00:14:47,096
He'll still need an I.D.
in order to exit the building.

375
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:48,440
Well, if he can break
into a house,

376
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:50,365
he can steal
a staff I.D.

377
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,211
I'll run down
all the gang members

378
00:14:53,235 --> 00:14:55,904
who work for Father Lopez.

379
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,240
Cruz agreed to a drug test,

380
00:14:58,274 --> 00:15:00,676
so we should have those results
in a couple hours.

381
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,121
For the first time in his life,
I actually think he's innocent.

382
00:15:03,145 --> 00:15:04,679
I've always been so hard on him.

383
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:05,957
Maybe if I had been
more supportive,

384
00:15:05,981 --> 00:15:08,350
he would have gotten clean sooner.
You know better.

385
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,186
Addicts only get clean
when they are ready.

386
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:14,590
Oh. There you are.

387
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:15,890
Uh, you okay?

388
00:15:15,924 --> 00:15:18,327
You're looking a little shiny.
Yeah.

389
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,562
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.
I just feel a little warm.

390
00:15:20,596 --> 00:15:22,999
Look, I thought you should know,
hospital's locked down

391
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:25,235
while they search
for a homicide suspect.

392
00:15:25,268 --> 00:15:26,601
I'm heading over to supervise.

393
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,770
There's a killer in the hospital
with my mother?

394
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,041
Relax. She's fine.

395
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:32,542
I assigned Thorsen
to watch her door.

396
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:36,046
Hi, ma'am. I'm Officer Aaron Thorsen.
Hm?

397
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:37,389
I've been assigned
to keep you safe,

398
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:38,347
and I just want to let you know

399
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,758
that there's nothing
to worry about.

400
00:15:39,782 --> 00:15:41,750
You are handsome.

401
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:44,919
Thank you.

402
00:15:44,953 --> 00:15:47,023
Do you have any sisters?

403
00:15:47,057 --> 00:15:48,524
No, I'm an only child.
Cousins?

404
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:53,696
My second eldest son, Benny,
he is successful, sweet,

405
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:55,164
goes to church on Sundays.
Mm.

406
00:15:55,197 --> 00:15:57,567
But he needs a woman
to settle down with.

407
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,535
Are you asking me to set up one
of my cousins with your son?

408
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,907
And in return, I will set you up
with my niece, Isabella.

409
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,308
She's a professional dancer.

410
00:16:08,244 --> 00:16:10,245
You got a picture?
Mm-hmm.

411
00:16:12,947 --> 00:16:14,950
Oh, yeah.
Mm-hmm.

412
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:18,053
It's probably
just a muscle spasm.

413
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:18,854
You didn't have to clock out.

414
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:20,355
Of course I did.

415
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:23,725
Oh, hey. I'm just
searching for bad guys.

416
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,595
All clear here.

417
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:27,596
Wait, so Nolan's leaving
someone on every floor?

418
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:30,066
Yes. We've been cops
for more than 10 seconds.

419
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,400
We can handle this.

420
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:33,369
Hey, Doc, what's the word?

421
00:16:33,403 --> 00:16:35,404
When we took that bullet out
a few years back,

422
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:38,039
there was a-a fragment that was
too complicated to remove.

423
00:16:38,073 --> 00:16:40,110
I remember.
Bullet?

424
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:42,445
I was shot.
It wasn't a big deal.

425
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:44,679
I saved his life
first day on the job.

426
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,216
It was a huge deal.

427
00:16:46,249 --> 00:16:48,017
Back to the fragment.

428
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,419
The pain you're experiencing
is because the fragment

429
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:52,221
has migrated closer
to your spinal column

430
00:16:52,254 --> 00:16:54,256
and is pressing up
against a nerve.

431
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:55,890
We'll need to do surgery
to remove it.

432
00:16:55,924 --> 00:16:58,260
Okay.
Uh, when?

433
00:16:58,293 --> 00:17:00,696
Well, I mean, hold on.
Wh-What are the risks?

434
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,567
Well, we are talking about
the spine, so...

435
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,701
yes, it's risky.

436
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,436
But it's laparoscopic.

437
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,505
So if all goes well,
he'll be home by dinner.

438
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:10,506
If?

439
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:11,874
I know it's scary,

440
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,076
but leaving the fragment
in place is much riskier.

441
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,711
Well, then we do surgery.

442
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:16,945
Thank you.

443
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:24,019
Uh...

444
00:17:24,053 --> 00:17:26,221
I'm gonna get back
to the search.

445
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,228
South wing is clear.
Headed to north.

446
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,900
Sir. Are you...?

447
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,001
Oh, my... Oh!

448
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:41,537
I... I need help over here!

449
00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:49,211
Ah, good thing I was
on the Whole30 diet.

450
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:51,346
That food poisoning is no joke.

451
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:55,684
Marshall can never pick
the breakfast place again.

452
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:56,685
Never.

453
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:57,886
Oh, no.

454
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,020
This is kind of fun.

455
00:17:59,054 --> 00:17:59,855
It's like a sleepover.

456
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:01,723
Oh, God.

457
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:03,092
Should I call the nurse?

458
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,759
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

459
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:07,396
- You need to get back
to the station immediately. - What?

460
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,597
What? Why?

461
00:18:08,631 --> 00:18:11,366
Because if we're both
out of commission...

462
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,001
Based on seniority...

463
00:18:13,035 --> 00:18:14,470
Smitty's in charge.

464
00:18:16,038 --> 00:18:17,449
Oh.
Yeah. You're still standing there.

465
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,174
Go.
Yeah.

466
00:18:19,209 --> 00:18:20,509
Hey, man.
All right, bro.

467
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,549
Smitty.
Smitty!

468
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,384
Hey!
Wha... What's going on?

469
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:31,019
Acting Sergeant Smitty.

470
00:18:31,053 --> 00:18:32,922
Right. Why is Casey Curtis
leaving the station?

471
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:34,324
End of shift time off.

472
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:35,758
When you're in charge,

473
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,593
you can let all your friends
go home early.

474
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:39,161
But we're short today.

475
00:18:39,194 --> 00:18:40,162
You know how many units
are attached

476
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:40,996
to the hospital event, right?

477
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:42,531
Self-care is important.

478
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:44,032
Smitty...

479
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:46,935
- Get out!
- All right!

480
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:48,371
What the hell
is going on?

481
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:50,443
We caught the guy who beat up
Father Lopez's mother.

482
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,576
We heard what happened
to your mom and wanted to help.

483
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:56,111
So you abducted a man?

484
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:57,846
It was a citizen's arrest.

485
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,582
On what evidence?

486
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:01,692
He's been talkin' smack about
Father Lopez for weeks!

487
00:19:01,717 --> 00:19:02,951
The whole hood heard him.

488
00:19:02,984 --> 00:19:05,054
He's lucky that's all I did.

489
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:06,655
Hypocrite's sleeping
with my wife.

490
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:10,526
With me, now.

491
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,868
You're sleeping with his wife?

492
00:19:19,902 --> 00:19:20,702
You're a priest.

493
00:19:20,736 --> 00:19:21,903
I know.

494
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,075
I know.

495
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,878
Been struggling
with my vows recently.

496
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:31,547
Are you kidding me?

497
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,517
Jumping to adultery
is more than just struggling.

498
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,752
We all fall short
of the glory of God.

499
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:40,690
But I really don't think Carmody
had anything to do with Mom.

500
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,594
I have to look into it.

501
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:47,396
You never know
what people are capable of.

502
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,097
I didn't know you were
capable of this.

503
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:57,282
You know,
with your injury,

504
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:59,674
you could retire right now
if you wanted.

505
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:02,377
She's right.

506
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:03,454
Are you trying to get rid of me?

507
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:06,548
It's not a crazy idea.

508
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:09,551
My dad waited too long
to call it quits.

509
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,554
He can't do any of
the things he planned on.

510
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,489
It's a good deal.

511
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:18,661
Disability pay is the average of
your last three years of income,

512
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:22,664
50% salary plus overtime.

513
00:20:22,698 --> 00:20:25,034
That's about 60%
of your current take home.

514
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,435
And that's tax free, right?

515
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:28,037
Yes, it is.

516
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,339
Plus, my dad gets
a cost-of-living adjustment.

517
00:20:30,373 --> 00:20:34,042
That's a 3% raise every year,
for life.

518
00:20:34,076 --> 00:20:36,177
I never really
did the math before.

519
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:39,682
Just think.
We both love to travel.

520
00:20:39,714 --> 00:20:42,250
I always did want to see a game
at every Major League stadium.

521
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,355
W-We could even
move out of L.A.

522
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:47,356
I mean, I can be
a lifeguard anywhere.

523
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,710
Right? So long
as there's a beach.

524
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:52,027
I hear Bali has
a bunch of those.

525
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,663
That's true.

526
00:20:53,695 --> 00:20:55,263
This is so exciting.

527
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:56,699
No, I haven't decided anything.

528
00:20:56,731 --> 00:20:59,201
No, I know, but...

529
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:01,069
Free money?

530
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:02,571
You'd be crazy not to, right?

531
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:04,105
Hm.

532
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:08,810
Anybody else hungry?

533
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,082
Probably not the best time,
right?

534
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:14,616
I'll pass.

535
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,053
I'm just gonna grab something
from the cafeteria.

536
00:21:18,086 --> 00:21:19,086
Bye.

537
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:22,557
Just think about it.

538
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:24,026
Okay.

539
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,875
Have they been assessed yet?

540
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:37,006
Here's the thing.
Melody... she's wonderful.

541
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:38,584
I love her to death.
She's my favorite cousin.

542
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:40,041
But?

543
00:21:40,075 --> 00:21:42,377
But I-I don't think
she's right for Cruz.

544
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:43,588
You know, he needs
someone who's solid

545
00:21:43,613 --> 00:21:44,890
and is gonna call him
on his B.S.

546
00:21:44,913 --> 00:21:46,749
You're thinking Tara.

547
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:47,950
You're not wrong.

548
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:53,021
Okay, Angela just sent me
a photo of this guy Carmody.

549
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:54,164
Is this the man
that attacked you?

550
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:55,156
No.

551
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,258
No?
Mnh-mnh.

552
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,290
Oh.

553
00:21:59,628 --> 00:22:01,606
Okay, I told her that they're
gonna be releasing you soon,

554
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:03,699
so she should be on her way.

555
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:05,835
Oh, hey, did you set up
Wesley and Lopez?

556
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:08,170
No.
She never needed my help.

557
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,573
She was born
knowing her own mind.

558
00:22:10,605 --> 00:22:12,674
Yeah, that sounds like Lopez.

559
00:22:14,443 --> 00:22:15,778
Can I see Isabella
one more time?

560
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,078
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

561
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,782
Wow!
Yeah, I'm telling you.

562
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:21,816
Very flexible.

563
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:25,319
Clear.

564
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:28,190
You know, cops spend an awful
lot of time in hospitals.

565
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,357
Whatever your aversion is,

566
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:30,259
you're gonna have to
deal with it.

567
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:31,826
I know.

568
00:22:31,861 --> 00:22:34,195
I have to ask...
You don't see dead people?

569
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:36,065
No.

570
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:37,843
I mean, who doesn't feel
a presence from time to time?

571
00:22:37,866 --> 00:22:39,034
Me.

572
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:39,902
Most everyone I know.

573
00:22:39,934 --> 00:22:41,069
Yeah, but I'm not crazy.

574
00:22:41,103 --> 00:22:43,673
I don't see dead people.
Good.

575
00:22:43,705 --> 00:22:47,409
It's just that hospitals
remind me of my sister.

576
00:22:47,442 --> 00:22:49,344
When they found her,
she was in bad shape.

577
00:22:49,377 --> 00:22:52,781
She, uh, held out for two weeks,

578
00:22:52,815 --> 00:22:54,849
and I visited every day.

579
00:22:54,884 --> 00:22:56,117
I'm sorry.

580
00:22:58,721 --> 00:22:59,421
Next floor?

581
00:22:59,454 --> 00:23:00,855
Yeah.

582
00:23:11,601 --> 00:23:13,603
She's one of the best
surgeons in the country.

583
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:17,539
I'm not worried.

584
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:19,407
It's okay if you are.

585
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,744
Eh, it's just a little
spinal surgery, you know?

586
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:24,179
Might be fine.

587
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:26,381
Might be paralyzed for life.

588
00:23:26,414 --> 00:23:28,784
Excited to find out which.

589
00:23:28,817 --> 00:23:32,320
I'm gonna go stretch
my legs while I still can.

590
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:33,522
Agh.

591
00:23:33,556 --> 00:23:34,990
That's the spirit.

592
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:47,903
Mm.

593
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:59,280
- Hey.
- Hey.

594
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:11,425
Agh.
Agh!

595
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,426
Agh!

596
00:24:19,602 --> 00:24:20,536
It was the shooter.

597
00:24:20,569 --> 00:24:22,104
Don't try to move.
I can't.

598
00:24:22,136 --> 00:24:23,673
What happened?

599
00:24:23,705 --> 00:24:25,349
The fragment must've shifted
towards Tim's spinal cord,

600
00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:26,684
and that's what's causing
his paralysis.

601
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,509
Can you tell my sister, please?

602
00:24:28,544 --> 00:24:29,912
Sure.

603
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,682
Hey, do not tell Chen.

604
00:24:33,715 --> 00:24:35,084
She's got enough on her plate.

605
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:37,451
We need to get you
into surgery stat.

606
00:24:37,486 --> 00:24:38,486
Agh!

607
00:24:48,698 --> 00:24:50,098
If you two hit it off...
Mm-hmm.

608
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:52,233
...I expect you to name
your firstborn after me.

609
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:54,403
Okay, that's a deal.

610
00:24:54,435 --> 00:24:56,771
Mom, are you setting up Aaron?
Yes.

611
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:59,208
Don't you think he'd be perfect
for Isabella?

612
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,611
Izzie's way out of his league.
No offense.

613
00:25:01,644 --> 00:25:03,444
No, I agree.

614
00:25:03,478 --> 00:25:05,180
Any news on Tim?
No.

615
00:25:05,213 --> 00:25:06,625
He's still in surgery
for about two more hours.

616
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:07,616
Oh.

617
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,018
Go join the manhunt.

618
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,285
Okay.

619
00:25:12,453 --> 00:25:14,489
Your brothers texted me

620
00:25:14,522 --> 00:25:16,224
to say you interrogated them
at the station

621
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:18,059
like common criminals.

622
00:25:18,093 --> 00:25:20,070
You know I don't like it when
you fight with your brothers.

623
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:21,931
Mom, you were assaulted.

624
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:23,598
Aw.
You're lucky you're okay.

625
00:25:23,633 --> 00:25:26,035
But one of your sons
is in serious danger.

626
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,444
And if there's something
you're not telling me,

627
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:28,671
you're not protecting them.

628
00:25:28,703 --> 00:25:29,904
You're leaving them at risk.

629
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:31,105
I told you everything.

630
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,207
Tell me again.

631
00:25:34,143 --> 00:25:37,112
I went outside to wait
for my rideshare.

632
00:25:37,145 --> 00:25:39,080
Out of nowhere,
a man attacked me.

633
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:40,548
I hit him with my purse.

634
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:42,718
He said, "Tell your son"...
Back up.

635
00:25:42,751 --> 00:25:44,686
Rideshare?
What happened to your car?

636
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,855
I gave it to Benny.

637
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:47,332
What do you mean,
you gave it to Benny?

638
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:48,824
He said he needed it.

639
00:25:48,857 --> 00:25:50,259
I didn't ask.

640
00:25:52,126 --> 00:25:54,864
You've reached Benjamin Lopez.

641
00:25:54,896 --> 00:25:57,066
Leave a message.

642
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:01,871
Hey, how's Tim?

643
00:26:01,903 --> 00:26:03,038
Still in surgery.

644
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:04,405
Is Benny still at the station?

645
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:05,907
No. He went to work.
Why?

646
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,942
He lied.
He's having money problems.

647
00:26:07,977 --> 00:26:09,386
I tried to call him,
but he's not answering.

648
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:10,779
We ran his credit report.

649
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:12,513
We didn't see
any outstanding loans.

650
00:26:12,547 --> 00:26:14,415
An enforcer going after family?

651
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,118
That's off-the-books debt.
He's into a loan shark.

652
00:26:17,152 --> 00:26:18,921
We need to find him
so I can kill him

653
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,588
before somebody else does.

654
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:23,692
Jan.

655
00:26:23,726 --> 00:26:25,027
Where's everybody going?

656
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,095
Pool party at Mario's.

657
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:27,696
- No...
- No.

658
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,007
Uh, we don't have
the staff for that.

659
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,332
Y-You have to stay.

660
00:26:30,365 --> 00:26:33,567
Well, Acting Sergeant Smitty
says we don't.

661
00:26:36,204 --> 00:26:37,740
Oh. Can you
talk to them?

662
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:39,741
I believe it was Tim and Grey
who sent you back

663
00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:41,042
to rein in Smitty.

664
00:26:41,076 --> 00:26:42,411
They don't respect me, but...

665
00:26:42,443 --> 00:26:44,445
What are you talking about?
You just saw. I...

666
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,715
Yeah, that's because
Smitty told them to go home.

667
00:26:46,749 --> 00:26:48,784
You just have to tell them
something different.

668
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,419
Hey.

669
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:52,186
After everything
you have been through,

670
00:26:52,221 --> 00:26:54,522
how often you
have proven yourself,

671
00:26:54,556 --> 00:26:56,667
there is not a cop in here
who would not have your back

672
00:26:56,692 --> 00:26:58,492
if you asked.

673
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:02,832
Uh, hey, guys, listen up.

674
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:04,700
I need your help.

675
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,111
We have two sergeants
out of commission

676
00:27:06,134 --> 00:27:07,269
in the hospital right now

677
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:08,903
and a murder suspect
on the loose.

678
00:27:08,938 --> 00:27:11,339
That search has us
spread pretty thin.

679
00:27:11,373 --> 00:27:13,275
We need all hands on deck
right now.

680
00:27:13,307 --> 00:27:15,176
I'm sorry, but the pool party,

681
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,244
it has to wait.

682
00:27:19,647 --> 00:27:21,750
- You got it, Chen.
- All right.

683
00:27:21,784 --> 00:27:22,951
Let's go, guys.

684
00:27:22,984 --> 00:27:24,261
She needs us.
You heard her.

685
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:26,520
Thank you, thank you.

686
00:27:26,555 --> 00:27:28,190
Thank you!

687
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:30,558
So, does this mean
you're in charge now?

688
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:34,063
Yeah, I guess so.

689
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:36,766
Cool.
I'll be in the breakroom.

690
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:39,701
Being in charge is exhausting.

691
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:49,278
Nolan!

692
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:55,951
He cut the wire so the alarm
wouldn't go off.

693
00:27:55,984 --> 00:27:58,052
Nice catch.
I'll cover.

694
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,027
I see blood.

695
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,701
Should we split up?

696
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,103
Well, proper procedure says

697
00:28:14,135 --> 00:28:16,105
we stay within
40 feet of each other,

698
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:17,239
hearing distance,

699
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:19,008
just in case
anything goes wrong.

700
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,085
If you'd rather
stick together...

701
00:28:20,108 --> 00:28:21,844
No. I can handle it.

702
00:28:21,876 --> 00:28:23,178
We got to find this guy fast.

703
00:28:23,211 --> 00:28:24,445
All right.

704
00:28:24,479 --> 00:28:25,780
I'll go left.
You go right.

705
00:28:25,815 --> 00:28:26,848
We'll meet up back here.

706
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:28,616
Copy.

707
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:00,015
Jasper.

708
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:03,152
Not a sound,
or I'll blow your head off.

709
00:29:16,597 --> 00:29:17,731
Celina!

710
00:29:25,907 --> 00:29:28,844
7-Adam-15, I have an officer
down and another one missing.

711
00:29:30,778 --> 00:29:32,346
7-Adam-15?

712
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:37,519
7-Adam-15, I have
priority traffic.

713
00:29:37,551 --> 00:29:39,855
Be smart.
Just keep moving...

714
00:29:39,888 --> 00:29:40,932
All units clear the air
for priority traffic.

715
00:29:40,955 --> 00:29:42,432
...and everything will be fine.
Adam-15 go.

716
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:44,035
I can't raise
Officer Juarez on the radio.

717
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:46,037
She may have been 2-0-7'd
but still in the hospital.

718
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,238
I need additional units
to help search.

719
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:48,230
Turn that off.

720
00:29:48,262 --> 00:29:50,065
- I said turn it off!
- I did.

721
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:52,201
Where are we going?
To the ambulance bay?

722
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:53,602
Just shut up and keep moving.

723
00:29:58,606 --> 00:30:00,174
Okay. Okay.

724
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:02,611
Get in.
Get in.

725
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:08,717
Oh.

726
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:11,220
Just give me a minute.

727
00:30:11,252 --> 00:30:12,596
Look, there's no
happy endings here.

728
00:30:12,621 --> 00:30:14,056
You know that, right?
Shut up.

729
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:15,432
You need to get
your wounds treated.

730
00:30:15,457 --> 00:30:16,534
You should have
kidnapped a doctor.

731
00:30:16,557 --> 00:30:17,659
Shut up.

732
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,161
I just need to catch my breath.

733
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:21,762
Let me at least take a look
at your wounds.

734
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:23,198
Nice try.

735
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,366
Look...

736
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,269
police officers have a sworn
responsibility to render aid,

737
00:30:28,303 --> 00:30:29,663
even to people
trying to kill them.

738
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,107
Lift your shirt.
Okay.

739
00:30:34,476 --> 00:30:36,211
All righty.

740
00:30:40,082 --> 00:30:42,584
Okay. Uh...

741
00:30:42,616 --> 00:30:44,519
Listen.
You need this.

742
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:46,087
Okay?
These are antibiotics.

743
00:30:46,121 --> 00:30:47,021
You can see the label
right there.

744
00:30:47,056 --> 00:30:48,390
Oh, forget it.
We gotta go.

745
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:49,857
It'll just take two seconds.

746
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,568
And your wounds are definitely
infected by this point.

747
00:30:51,593 --> 00:30:52,594
Just let me do this.

748
00:30:52,626 --> 00:30:55,529
Okay. Okay.

749
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:56,530
Come on.
Okay.

750
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:58,200
Let's go.
Okay.

751
00:31:00,434 --> 00:31:02,671
Let me see.

752
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:07,108
Okay.

753
00:31:07,142 --> 00:31:09,111
Now you're gonna
drive us out of here.

754
00:31:09,144 --> 00:31:10,112
Let's go.

755
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:12,614
Okay. All righty.

756
00:31:22,356 --> 00:31:23,692
Aah!
Whoa!

757
00:31:32,866 --> 00:31:33,835
What are you doing?

758
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:34,867
Just give it a second.

759
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:38,307
Give what a second?

760
00:31:39,907 --> 00:31:41,210
How did you manage that?

761
00:31:41,242 --> 00:31:43,244
I showed him the antibiotic,

762
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,779
but then with a little
sleight of hand, morphine.

763
00:31:45,814 --> 00:31:47,449
Impressive.

764
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:49,521
My sister and I used to do
these little magic shows.

765
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,528
I'll bet they were amazing.

766
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,921
It was.

767
00:31:54,022 --> 00:31:55,490
Should be good to go.

768
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:14,009
Am I under arrest?

769
00:32:14,042 --> 00:32:15,943
Depends.
You got a permit?

770
00:32:16,944 --> 00:32:18,913
Yeah.

771
00:32:18,946 --> 00:32:20,714
Back at the house.

772
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:22,384
What are you doing here, Benny?

773
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:25,686
Are you asking as a cop
or as my sister?

774
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,189
I'm asking as a sister.

775
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:29,057
I'm listening as a cop.

776
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,827
I bought some stocks
on a margin.

777
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:35,396
The stocks went south.

778
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,531
Margin got called.

779
00:32:37,566 --> 00:32:38,666
I didn't have it.

780
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,867
How much?

781
00:32:39,901 --> 00:32:42,104
500 grand.
Hmm.

782
00:32:43,738 --> 00:32:45,740
I sold everything
I could get my hands on.

783
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:47,175
I was still a hundred short.

784
00:32:47,209 --> 00:32:48,942
So you went to a loan shark?

785
00:32:48,977 --> 00:32:51,445
I know I screwed up.
I can fix it.

786
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,115
No.

787
00:32:53,147 --> 00:32:54,915
You're gonna let us handle it.

788
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:57,652
What is this loan shark's name,
and where can we find him?

789
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:03,692
Anyone ever tell you
not to lend to a guy

790
00:33:03,724 --> 00:33:06,060
whose sister is a cop?

791
00:33:06,095 --> 00:33:08,262
Detectives.

792
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:10,231
I haven't done anything illegal.

793
00:33:10,265 --> 00:33:13,501
Just a legitimate loan
to a guy who's down on his luck.

794
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:15,069
Well, your legitimate
collection agent

795
00:33:15,104 --> 00:33:16,570
landed my mom in the hospital.

796
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:18,006
Emilia wasn't kidding
when she said

797
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,273
she got you with her purse.

798
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:21,210
You are under arrest
for assault,

799
00:33:21,242 --> 00:33:24,045
with an enhancement
for elder abuse.

800
00:33:24,078 --> 00:33:26,159
Don't mess with the Lopez women.
It doesn't end well.

801
00:33:41,028 --> 00:33:43,632
The doctor said they got
the bullet fragment.

802
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:47,568
There's nothing to worry about.

803
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:48,537
That's great.

804
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:53,074
I never thought I'd be so happy
to feel pain in my life.

805
00:33:56,711 --> 00:33:58,447
You okay?

806
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,214
No.

807
00:34:02,284 --> 00:34:05,019
There's something
I have to tell you.

808
00:34:05,053 --> 00:34:06,921
Ash...

809
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:10,659
I spent my whole life
worrying about my dad.

810
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:14,195
If he was late getting home,

811
00:34:14,228 --> 00:34:15,864
Mom would pretend
everything was fine,

812
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:19,099
but I know she was terrified.

813
00:34:19,134 --> 00:34:21,702
When I saw you wheeled
into surgery,

814
00:34:21,735 --> 00:34:25,106
I realized...

815
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,809
I can't do that again.

816
00:34:29,378 --> 00:34:32,414
Are... Are y-you
breaking up with me?

817
00:34:36,751 --> 00:34:38,786
I'm sorry.

818
00:34:40,054 --> 00:34:41,590
I just got out of surgery.

819
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,592
I know.

820
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:48,230
I thought I'd get it in
before the anesthesia wore off.

821
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:53,702
I... still love you.

822
00:34:53,735 --> 00:34:59,007
I'll probably be in love with
you for longer than I'd like.

823
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,510
And if there was any chance
you were going to retire...

824
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:10,251
I know.

825
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,655
Can I get you anything?

826
00:35:16,391 --> 00:35:18,393
No.

827
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:22,797
Okay.
I'll go, then.

828
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:42,351
So, now how do you feel
about hospitals?

829
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:44,552
I love them.

830
00:35:44,585 --> 00:35:45,862
- Nah, today was great.
- You're good to go.

831
00:35:45,887 --> 00:35:47,856
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

832
00:35:47,889 --> 00:35:50,759
You know, that, uh,
morphine move was very smart.

833
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:51,760
I would not have
thought of that.

834
00:35:51,793 --> 00:35:53,762
Thank you.
Uh...

835
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:55,730
What is it?

836
00:35:55,764 --> 00:35:57,007
Oh, you're gonna
think I'm crazy.

837
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,032
No, never.

838
00:35:58,065 --> 00:35:59,900
It was my sister's idea.

839
00:35:59,934 --> 00:36:01,603
Oh.
Mm.

840
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:05,539
As in you saw her or...?

841
00:36:05,574 --> 00:36:07,509
No.

842
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:08,510
I can't really explain it.

843
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:10,512
I-I feel like she was with me.

844
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:11,612
It's weird.

845
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:14,849
Oh, well, I think that's
a... a lovely thought,

846
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,719
as long as there were no,
you know,

847
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:19,019
auditory hallucinations...

848
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:20,188
No.
I had to ask.

849
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:27,027
Oh.

850
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:28,262
Uh, Watch Commander's office.

851
00:36:28,297 --> 00:36:30,164
Sergeant Grey is unavailable.

852
00:36:30,197 --> 00:36:31,699
End of shift is denied and...

853
00:36:34,268 --> 00:36:35,280
Hey, there you are.

854
00:36:35,304 --> 00:36:36,938
I was just calling.

855
00:36:36,971 --> 00:36:37,771
Hey.

856
00:36:37,806 --> 00:36:39,708
So, how'd it go?

857
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,041
It was great.

858
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:43,077
It was...

859
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,447
I just spoke with
the Communications Supervisor.

860
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,150
Said you did a masterful job
managing calls

861
00:36:49,182 --> 00:36:50,485
with half the normal staff.

862
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:52,653
Hmm.
Thank you.

863
00:36:52,686 --> 00:36:55,324
I am so ready to give you
your job back.

864
00:36:56,858 --> 00:36:58,192
Understood.

865
00:36:58,226 --> 00:37:00,027
Good night, sir.
Good night.

866
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:02,030
Oh, uh, how was
Tim's laparoscopic?

867
00:37:03,898 --> 00:37:07,369
Yeah. Um...

868
00:37:07,402 --> 00:37:09,938
He ended up needing
emergency spinal surgery.

869
00:37:22,916 --> 00:37:24,184
Are you okay?

870
00:37:24,217 --> 00:37:25,362
Uh, why didn't anyone tell me?

871
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:27,822
No, I'm... I'm good.
I'm good.

872
00:37:27,856 --> 00:37:31,159
Doctor said I'm gonna
make a full recovery.

873
00:37:31,192 --> 00:37:34,329
And I told everyone
to keep you in the dark.

874
00:37:34,362 --> 00:37:35,697
Why?

875
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,809
I didn't want you to worry.

876
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,536
So, just to be clear...

877
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,746
You thought you might
be paralyzed,

878
00:37:42,771 --> 00:37:44,204
but you were worried about me?

879
00:37:44,237 --> 00:37:45,516
You know what?
Slow your roll, Chen.

880
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:50,043
Clearly, I misspoke.
I was worried about the station.

881
00:37:50,077 --> 00:37:52,746
And I knew you'd be
too concerned about me

882
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,083
to take over for Smitty.

883
00:37:55,115 --> 00:37:57,184
Mm-hmm.

884
00:37:57,217 --> 00:37:59,353
I heard you saved the day,
though.

885
00:37:59,387 --> 00:38:01,088
Being sergeant's not so hard.

886
00:38:01,121 --> 00:38:02,990
I don't know why
you're always complaining.

887
00:38:03,023 --> 00:38:06,193
Really?
Just smooth sailing?

888
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:08,597
No. It was awful.

889
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,532
How do that many things
go wrong in one day?

890
00:38:10,565 --> 00:38:12,400
That wasn't even
a particularly bad day.

891
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:16,371
Where's Ashley?

892
00:38:16,405 --> 00:38:18,840
Yeah, I-I, uh...
I sent her home.

893
00:38:18,873 --> 00:38:20,675
She was exhausted.

894
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:22,476
Okay. Hm.

895
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:27,114
What are you doing?

896
00:38:28,782 --> 00:38:31,251
I'm keeping you company.

897
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:34,355
You don't have to do that.

898
00:38:34,389 --> 00:38:35,523
I know.

899
00:38:39,527 --> 00:38:43,164
Okay, okay.

900
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:44,331
- Oh, okay.
- Just open it.

901
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,701
- Sure. Okay.
- He's fine. He's fine.

902
00:38:46,735 --> 00:38:50,003
Okay, so and then the door
opens, and Wesley walks in

903
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:51,706
to represent me.

904
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:53,240
All of us.

905
00:38:53,273 --> 00:38:54,452
I thought Angela's head
was going to explode.

906
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:57,945
Good man, looking out for
your brothers-in-law.

907
00:38:57,978 --> 00:38:59,780
Whoa.
Good man?

908
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:01,550
- Brave man.
- No, no, no, no.

909
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,184
No, no, no, no.
Not... Not so brave.

910
00:39:03,217 --> 00:39:05,385
I knew that
she would understand.

911
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,590
Angela believes
in tough love, sure.

912
00:39:08,623 --> 00:39:11,525
But no one is more protective
of the people she cares about.

913
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:12,726
Oh.

914
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:15,362
I have something to say.

915
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,398
Mom, you don't have to.
Yes, I do.

916
00:39:17,431 --> 00:39:21,536
It's something I should have
said a long time ago to you.

917
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,103
I know you always thought

918
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:26,340
I didn't pay you
enough attention growing up,

919
00:39:26,373 --> 00:39:29,677
that all my focus
went to your brothers.

920
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,081
I always denied it,
but you were right.

921
00:39:33,114 --> 00:39:36,384
It's not because
I didn't love you as much.

922
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:42,891
You're my daughter,
my only daughter,

923
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:47,195
and I love you in a way
that is only for you.

924
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:54,001
But you didn't need me
as much as much.

925
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:56,570
Not the way they did.

926
00:39:56,605 --> 00:40:00,875
Since you could crawl,
you took care of yourself.

927
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:04,012
And when you could walk,
you took care of your brothers,

928
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:06,114
even though they were
older than you.

929
00:40:06,146 --> 00:40:10,985
And I relied on you.
I came to expect it.

930
00:40:11,018 --> 00:40:13,353
But as strong as you were,

931
00:40:13,387 --> 00:40:16,925
I should have realized that
you still needed your mother.

932
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:24,164
I love you, mija.

933
00:40:24,197 --> 00:40:25,567
And I'm sorry.

934
00:40:27,601 --> 00:40:28,769
To Angela.

935
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:29,947
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

936
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:31,204
- To Angela.
- Salud.

937
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,449
Salud.

938
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:35,009
Mom, I love you.

939
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,579
Thank you.

940
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:41,481
Are you still worried
I went back too soon?

941
00:40:41,516 --> 00:40:45,353
No. Actually, you seemed
pretty amazing today.

942
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,731
I guess the only
question left is,

943
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:48,922
are you ever gonna fill me in

944
00:40:48,956 --> 00:40:50,858
on the whole
"I was dead before" thing?

945
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:52,492
Well, there's not much to tell.

946
00:40:52,527 --> 00:40:54,494
You already know about
the second time...

947
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:57,565
My oxygen regulator
malfunctioned on a halo jump.

948
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,768
Luckily, the other guys noticed,
pulled my ripcord,

949
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:04,338
and brought me back to life
on the ground.

950
00:41:04,371 --> 00:41:07,108
That is so badass.

951
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:08,108
And the first time?

952
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:10,443
Two words... Big Foot.

953
00:41:10,478 --> 00:41:11,621
See, I don't even know
why I bother.

954
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:13,923
'Cause you love me.
Fair enough.

955
00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:21,422
You know, the first two times
I was brought back to life,

956
00:41:21,454 --> 00:41:26,027
I was scared, but only a little.

957
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:28,929
And I moved on pretty quickly.

958
00:41:28,963 --> 00:41:32,400
But this... this last time,

959
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:36,237
all I could think about
was losing you.

960
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:39,373
I've never been happier

961
00:41:39,407 --> 00:41:43,878
or felt more seen or loved.

962
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:46,614
And the thought
of losing a second

963
00:41:46,648 --> 00:41:50,150
of whatever time we have left
was heartbreaking.

964
00:41:51,952 --> 00:41:55,356
So here's my question.

965
00:41:57,224 --> 00:41:59,994
John Nolan...

966
00:42:00,027 --> 00:42:01,228
will you marry me?

967
00:42:05,699 --> 00:42:07,668
Try and stop me.

968
00:42:18,045 --> 00:42:20,981
