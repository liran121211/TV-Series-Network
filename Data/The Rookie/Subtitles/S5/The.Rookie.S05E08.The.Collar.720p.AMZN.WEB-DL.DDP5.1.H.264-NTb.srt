1
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:08,340
What about Kilimanjaro
for the honeymoon?

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,742
You mean like to climb?

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,445
It's more of
a strenuous hike.

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,246
Is there a beach
at the top?

5
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:18,650
Ooh, I don't want to lie,
but I do want you to say yes.

6
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:19,751
Celina: Morning!

7
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:21,321
Morning.
Morning.

8
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,556
I made you coffee, and
I found your special milk.

9
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:26,259
Thank you. No.
No, no more special milk.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,926
No more extra pillows.

11
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,263
Hotel Nolan
is officially closed.

12
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:32,265
Two nights
is more than enough.

13
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,866
I know. I'm back in my place
tonight, I swear.

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,404
Uh, my new mattress
and white-noise machine arrived today.

15
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:39,271
I wish I had that machine
last night.

16
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,441
That sound
was driving me crazy.

17
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,542
I didn't notice anything.
I did.

18
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,777
Every time I thought
it was going to stop,

19
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:46,378
it just ramped
back up again.

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,546
Was I snoring?

21
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,881
No. It was much softer
than that.

22
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,084
Like scratching.

23
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,451
Oh, probably a raccoon.

24
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:54,087
I'll check the crawl space
when I come home.

25
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,289
What do you know about
the history of your house?

26
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,457
I know what year
it was built.

27
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:01,293
No, I mean, like,
has anyone died here?

28
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:04,131
My house is not haunted.
You don't know that.

29
00:01:04,132 --> 00:01:07,200
The only unwanted entity
in this house,

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,935
I'm looking at right now.

31
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,780
Bah-bah-bah. Ohh.

32
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,615
Any chance you're gonna make it
to the pediatrician appointment today?

33
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,984
I mean, if everyone just
confesses to their crimes,

34
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,620
sure, but I doubt it.

35
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,787
Well, the thing is

36
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,823
Jack is due for
his vaccinations today.

37
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:32,825
And you're usually there
to soothe him.

38
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:35,228
He'll be fine. Just give him
Tylenol and cuddles.

39
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,063
I know. I just don't want him
to feel betrayed.

40
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:39,966
Like I took him to this place
he got jabbed by needles.

41
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:42,001
Better he feels
<i>I</i> betrayed him?

42
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:44,903
Y-Yeah.

43
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,340
I can see who's gonna be
the disciplinarian.

44
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,008
I got to go.

45
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:51,109
Bye, honey!

46
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,852
So, uh, I've been thinking.
Things are good between us.

47
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,855
Yeah.
You know, we've been through a lot,

48
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:05,325
and we've come
through it stronger.

49
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,527
I agree.

50
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:11,831
So, uh, maybe it's time
to move in together.

51
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,766
Maybe. Sure.

52
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,271
I mean, your place
is kind of small, though.

53
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,274
I-I know, but with
my new promotion,

54
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,943
I could maybe afford a cardboard
box deep in the Valley.

55
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:27,979
Wait. You want
to buy a house?

56
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,949
Yeah. That's what
grownups do, right?

57
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,652
And I know you won't go anywhere
without Tamara.

58
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,424
So what if we got a place
with a converted garage?

59
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,058
I'll have to
think about it.

60
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,360
Great.
Let's talk tonight.

61
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,229
I'll start looking
at listings.

62
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,132
So, I think I've proven myself,
you know,

63
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,699
with my contributions to cases,

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,336
and, you know,
I-I know I'm young,

65
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:53,206
but I really think that I could
really help out around...

66
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,307
Hey, sir, I was wondering
if I could have a minute.

67
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,675
You got 20 seconds. Go.

68
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,211
Okay. So you remember
the diamond case, right?

69
00:02:58,211 --> 00:02:59,545
It was my...
my first case.

70
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,681
Look, you're not gonna get
to the point at this rate.

71
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,683
Okay.
I want to be a detective,

72
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,419
and I will do anything
to make that happen.

73
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,054
Is that it?

74
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:10,056
Yes.
Alright.

75
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,723
Shadow Harper
and Lopez today.

76
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,526
- Hey, Tim.
- Yeah?

77
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:15,395
I'm reassigning Aaron
for today.

78
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,298
Lucy, that means
you're back on gopher duty.

79
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,733
Okay.

80
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,102
I could handle
one day alone.

81
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:25,237
Is there some reason
you two can't ride together?

82
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,776
Of course not.
No, sir.

83
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,479
Good.

84
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:36,317
Sorry.

85
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,885
Um...

86
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,454
I'll go get the gear. Okay.

87
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,756
Officer Thorsen
reporting for duty.

88
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,223
Grey just
signed off on it.

89
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,626
Told you he would.

90
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,295
I didn't realize
you wanted to be a detective.

91
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:50,462
I mean, to me, it seems like
the most effective way

92
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,098
to make sure other people
aren't railroaded like I was.

93
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,735
'Cause the detective
that was assigned <i>my</i> case,

94
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,103
he dropped the ball
every step of the way.

95
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,771
Well, he <i>was</i> French.

96
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,609
So, what, you've never seen,
like, a bad American detective?

97
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,110
That's fair.

98
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,645
But I do have to
warn you,

99
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,781
being a detective is nothing
like being on patrol.

100
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,883
The hours are brutal,

101
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:13,552
and the cases are
emotionally devastating

102
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:15,822
in a way that patrol
can't prepare you for.

103
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:17,956
Are you sure
you want this?

104
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,257
Yes, I'm sure.

105
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,793
What do you say we start with a test?
Oh.

106
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,829
How about a game
of five questions?

107
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:25,464
Okay. Let's go. Yeah.

108
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,834
As a detective, you need to
ask the right questions,

109
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,968
so I'll send you the first page
of a case file.

110
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,172
You can ask us five questions
and five questions only.

111
00:04:33,173 --> 00:04:35,608
So think carefully about what
you need to know to solve it.

112
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,444
Oh, I got this.

113
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,278
Alright,
so the records get dodgy,

114
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,848
but so far I haven't found
anyone who's died in your house.

115
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,516
On your land
is a bigger question.

116
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:45,617
Okay. I appreciate
all the hard work.

117
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,620
I think I'm just gonna
call an exterminator.

118
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,822
Look, I-I think you need
to broaden your understanding

119
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:52,959
of what's possible.
Have you tried ayahuasca?

120
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,427
Nolan: <i>Hmm.</i>

121
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:56,362
<i>You know, it really shifts
the way you see the world.</i>

122
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,697
<i>I think
it'd be good for you.</i>

123
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,999
<i>Is that the one that makes you
vomit uncontrollably?</i>

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,132
<i>It's very cleansing.</i>

125
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,834
<i>Yeah, I-I think
I want to keep</i>

126
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:05,036
<i>my perception
the way it is.</i>

127
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,814
So...

128
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,615
how's single life going?

129
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,518
It's good.
No one to complain

130
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,821
when I watch football
all Sunday.

131
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,656
You didn't leave
the house once?

132
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,057
I walked Kojo.

133
00:05:25,057 --> 00:05:26,459
Tim, what?

134
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,194
I spend all week outside.

135
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,629
No, I know, but we live
in a vibrant city.

136
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,899
There's always <i>something</i>
amazing going on.

137
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,800
Okay, so, don't get me wrong,
I love L.A.,

138
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:36,735
but it is <i>not</i>
a vibrant city, okay?

139
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:40,007
It's a loosely stitched together
patchwork of strip malls.

140
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,009
You're hopeless.

141
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:48,247
Chris:
<i>Hey! You busy?</i>

142
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,518
Uh, no.
Wh-Where are you?

143
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,185
An open house.
It was on my way to work.

144
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,654
Uh, what do you think?

145
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,723
It needs some work,

146
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,057
<i>but, uh,
it's three bedrooms.</i>

147
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:01,728
Yeah, I... I can't really see
anything. Can we talk later?

148
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,329
Okay. Love you.

149
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:04,831
Yeah.

150
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,165
Are you... Are you and Chris,
uh, moving in together?

151
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:09,268
No. Uh, it's...
I mean, he seems to think you are.

152
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,504
Yeah, I mean,
I don't know.

153
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:14,141
He kind of sprang it on me
this morning.

154
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,244
You guys are happy, right?

155
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,012
Yeah.
Those are the obvious next steps.

156
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,113
Yeah, no, we're super happy.
It's... It's good.

157
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,283
Dispatch: <i>7-Adam-100,
I have an in-progress vandalism</i>

158
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,286
<i>on West 3rd
south of Olympic.</i>

159
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,456
Yeah. Show us responding.

160
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,793
Krishna: No, no, no, no!
Not the Corvette!

161
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:34,793
You should've
thought of that

162
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,028
before you flirted
with that whore!

163
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,797
Babe! Aah!
Lucy: Oh, my God.

164
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,197
Our accountant?
She's 60!

165
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,266
And a stone-cold fox!

166
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:44,771
Tim: <i>Okay, ma'am... ma'am, put down the golf club.</i>
Krishna: <i>Oh, yeah?</i>

167
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,105
Sir, no!
Put the golf club down!

168
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:47,973
You wouldn't dare!
Is this what you want?

169
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:50,308
<i>Okay, that's it!
Enough! Weapons down!</i>

170
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,079
<i>Weapon?
It's a golf club.</i>

171
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,312
<i>Now.</i>

172
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,115
<i>I... Look, Officer,
this is a misunderstanding.</i>

173
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,451
<i>Who called you?</i>
That doesn't matter.

174
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,420
<i>It was the busybody
across the street, wasn't it?</i>

175
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,790
I bet she's posting
on Nextdoor!

176
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,291
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah,
of course she is.</i>

177
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,259
<i>You know, what else has she got
in her sad little life?</i>

178
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,663
She needs to put down the phone
and take in her garbage bins!

179
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:13,331
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

180
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,100
<i>Actually, can you guys
do something about that, huh?</i>

181
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,502
<i>She just leaves them
out there for days.</i>

182
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:18,605
<i>Not our jurisdiction.</i>

183
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,307
Okay. Fine.

184
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,744
Mm. So where do you want to go for brunch?
In bed.

185
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,946
<i>Mmm. I like the way
you're thinking.</i>

186
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,247
Okay. Either of you want
to make a report

187
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:30,917
about the damage
to your cars?

188
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,451
<i>At this point,</i>

189
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,286
<i>we have the body shop
on speed dial.</i>

190
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:45,197
So, have you thought of
your first question?

191
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:46,632
Yes.

192
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:49,536
I already went over the file
you gave me.

193
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,302
The remains were found
on the grounds

194
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:52,838
of the La Brea Tar Pits complex,

195
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,042
and a female guard went missing
one month prior.

196
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,276
Correct.

197
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,310
And it's always
the boyfriend.

198
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,148
Okay. First question.
Was she seeing anyone?

199
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,483
Yes. And he also worked
at the museum.

200
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,117
A paleontologist.

201
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,120
Oh, okay. So he had access
to the grounds.

202
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,856
Interesting.
Did he have an alibi?

203
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,692
No, he did not.

204
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:14,125
Okay.

205
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,461
So why haven't you and Bailey
set a date?

206
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:18,964
Oh, we're enjoying
being engaged.

207
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,466
Hm. Have something to do
with her crazy ex?

208
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:23,903
Are they even divorced?

209
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:25,637
Uh, yeah, they have been
for a while now.

210
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,238
How did you
even know about that?

211
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,707
I mean, cops gossip.

212
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,476
Really? About me?
What else do they say?

213
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,211
Well, they don't say, like,
anything bad.

214
00:08:33,212 --> 00:08:34,581
They just mention...

215
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,481
Whoa.

216
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,584
Light it up.

217
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,761
Ma'am?

218
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,932
Uh, ma'am, can you turn
the engine off for me?

219
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:55,100
Pam: I can't stop. I have to
keep driving. I'm sorry.

220
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,436
Ma'am, I need you
to stop the car.

221
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,738
<i>What is that
around your neck?</i>

222
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,206
<i>He made me put it on.</i>

223
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,509
<i>He said to drive
or he'd kill me.</i>

224
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,943
<i>Ma'am, is that a bomb?</i>

225
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,613
<i>I have to go.</i>

226
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:08,514
<i>I'm sorry.
I don't want to die.</i>

227
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,682
<i>I have to go.</i>

228
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,216
<i>Ma'am? Ma'am?
No. No!</i>

229
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:24,395
Pilot: <i>Air-3 is lifting off now.
ETA... 5 minutes from target.</i>

230
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:27,133
You made the right call. We have
to assume it's a real explosive.

231
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,701
Coordinating with
the bomb squad now.

232
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,469
Yes, sir.
What would you like us to do?

233
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,272
Follow her, but stay out of radio range.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

234
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,807
If the bomb has
a remote trigger,

235
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,043
our radio signal
could set it off.

236
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,611
Celina: Dropping back.
<i>We'll clear the streets.</i>

237
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,279
Air support's on its way.

238
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,548
Sir, maybe we can get
a court order

239
00:09:42,548 --> 00:09:43,750
for all the cell carriers.

240
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,618
Get phone numbers attached
to her home address.

241
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:46,985
It's already in process.

242
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,054
7-Adam-100, 2331,

243
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,956
stand by
for victim information.

244
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,625
Copy.
Copy.

245
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,961
Where do you want us?
<i>Scout for a staging area.</i>

246
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,895
Bomb squad needs
a wide-open space.

247
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,798
We have to limit
potential casualties.

248
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,667
There's an empty lot
near Nolan's location.

249
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:02,802
Perfect.
I'll send backup to you now.

250
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:05,837
So, Harper, Lopez, Nolan says
the driver's under duress.

251
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,472
Said she was told
to keep driving

252
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:08,640
or the bomb would detonate.

253
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,442
Did he give her
a destination?

254
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:12,443
No. Doesn't seem to be
about a target.

255
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,946
<i>She's</i> the target.

256
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,182
<i>So we need to find
whatever we can on her.</i>

257
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,950
Whoever chose her
did it for a reason.

258
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,818
We're on it. Nolan...

259
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,321
bomb squad needs to know what they're dealing with.
Can you get a picture?

260
00:10:22,322 --> 00:10:24,323
No problem.
Turning off radio, going dark.

261
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:27,192
Want you to pull up
next to that car.

262
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,360
Try and stay parallel.

263
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,796
The bomb car?
Yeah.

264
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,764
Okay. Getting closer
to the bomb car.

265
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,168
Alright.

266
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,369
Closer. Alright.

267
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,807
Uh, it's a hinged collar
secured around her neck,

268
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,975
kind of like handcuffs. Nolan...

269
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,013
With quarter-twenty tapped
standoffs at regular intervals.

270
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,147
Nolan.

271
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,350
The explosive is built
into the side of the unit.

272
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,820
Contains C-4. It's connected
with red and green wires.

273
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:55,321
J-John!
Almost done.

274
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,322
No, we have to fall back.

275
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,823
I just need a better look
at the clasp.

276
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,325
It's... It's secured
under her chin

277
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,695
with a pin post lock, dual-post
shackle-style mechanism.

278
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:07,866
God. Did you get it?
That was some slick driving.

279
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,368
Thanks.

280
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,570
Okay. Hopefully,
that's all they need.

281
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,371
I-I mean, that was
a pretty precise description.

282
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,875
Oh, in my previous life,
I was a contractor.

283
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,844
I'm surprised you remember
your past lives.

284
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,010
Celina.

285
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,846
I'm sorry.
Just kidding.

286
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,313
Lopez: We're on our way
to the victim's house now.

287
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,515
I need a scrub of
all social-media posts.

288
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,317
Thanks.
Pam's a lawyer.

289
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,019
We should start
with her client list.

290
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,989
I already put in a call
to her old law firm.

291
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,690
She had
a criminal-defense practice,

292
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,591
so there's no telling
who she pissed off.

293
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,161
Look at you.

294
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,096
I mean, if I want to become
detective before I'm 30,

295
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,596
I got to be on my game, right?

296
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:41,067
Does that mean you've thought
of your third question?

297
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:42,934
I have, but I don't
want to just assume

298
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,669
that the paleontologist
boyfriend did it,

299
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,940
so I need a more complete
picture of the guard's life.

300
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:49,508
Does she have
a criminal record?

301
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,110
As a matter of fact,
she was under investigation

302
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,511
at the time
of her disappearance.

303
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:56,749
They suspected her of stealing
small artifacts from the museum

304
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,750
and selling them
on the black market.

305
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,119
Maybe she got greedy

306
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,788
or threatened
to go to the police,

307
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:04,991
and whoever she was working with
decided she was a liability.

308
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,626
Is there a question
in there?

309
00:12:08,628 --> 00:12:09,796
Not yet.

310
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:13,198
Perfect.
There's plenty of space to...

311
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,102
Boy: Awesome, dude.

312
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,937
Flag on the play.
Parking lot is not empty.

313
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,438
Sgt. Grey:
<i>Clear it out now.</i>

314
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,740
I'm redirecting the bomb squad
to your location.

315
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:27,078
<i>Hey! LAPD! We need you guys
to clear out! Let's go!</i>

316
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,581
There's a bomb!
Run like hell!

317
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:30,883
Let's go!

318
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,720
Boy: Let's roll!

319
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,459
We have Pam's
mobile number.

320
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:45,463
Hi. It's Pam, right?
My name is John.

321
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:47,966
We have the bomb squad
on the way to help you out.

322
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,301
You are gonna be okay.

323
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,136
Right now,
I need you to follow us.

324
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,504
Can you do that?

325
00:12:52,504 --> 00:12:53,806
I need to call my mom.

326
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,474
I need to tell her
that I love her.

327
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:58,777
We can do that, but right now,
I need you to follow us

328
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,611
so we can meet up
with the bomb squad, okay?

329
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,847
He told me
to keep driving.

330
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,448
He said that I would die
if I didn't.

331
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,317
Pam, that's a lie.

332
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:08,153
Bomb squad says there's no GPS
on your collar, alright?

333
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,922
He can't tell
if you're stopped or not.

334
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:10,756
Are you sure?

335
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:12,490
Yes.
Yes, Pam, I am sure.

336
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,926
Now we're gonna pull out
in front of you

337
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,326
and you're gonna
follow us, okay?

338
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:16,495
Okay.

339
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:25,871
Pilot: <i>I have a visual.
Will maintain contact.</i>

340
00:13:25,873 --> 00:13:27,373
Alright, Pam.

341
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,440
Now, I want you to park

342
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:30,275
right up next
to the orange cone

343
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,844
that Sergeant Bradford
is setting out.

344
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,179
Okay?
Okay.

345
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:41,854
Yeah, you got it.
Gonna take you to a safe spot.

346
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:44,690
Alright, Pam, just checking in.
How are you doing?

347
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,692
Um... not great.

348
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,827
Please get this thing
off of me.

349
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,730
That's what
we're here to do.

350
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,802
Alright. And there they are.
Bomb squad is here.

351
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,038
We're gonna have you
out of that in no time.

352
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,474
Now, Pam, earlier you said you
wanted me to call your mother.

353
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,543
Is there anyone else
you want me to get ahold of?

354
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,645
No. Not really.

355
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:08,914
Is that pathetic?

356
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,549
Not at all.

357
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,985
There's nothing like
a traumatic event

358
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,989
to make you realize that your...
that your life is empty.

359
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,658
Come on, Pam.
I don't believe that.

360
00:14:20,594 --> 00:14:23,361
My entire life is work.

361
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,264
I have no friends.

362
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,200
I'm completely alone.

363
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,236
You're not alone, Pam.
'Cause I'm here now.

364
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,440
Everyone here
is here to help you.

365
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:36,774
I need you to cut off
your engine now, Pam.

366
00:14:36,775 --> 00:14:38,911
You see that guy behind you
in the doughboy suit?

367
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:42,114
That's Mike. Mike is absolutely
the best there is.

368
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,384
Alright? He's gonna get you
out of there in no time.

369
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,619
The only problem is, uh,

370
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,788
he tells very bad
dad jokes,

371
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:52,057
so I'm gonna have to
apologize in advance.

372
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,293
Alright.
He's there at your window.

373
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,394
Mike: <i>It's locked.</i>

374
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,764
I just need you to reach down
and open the door, okay, Pam?

375
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:01,633
I can't.
I can't move. Hey...

376
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,902
Yes, you can do this.
You can do this, Pam.

377
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,138
Just take a...
take a nice deep breath.

378
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,575
Reach down.
Unlock that door.

379
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:14,546
I-I can't.
I can't. I can't.

380
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:18,116
You got this.
I know as soon as I move, this thing's gonna go off!

381
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,786
No, come on. Come on, Pam.
It's almost over.

382
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:21,919
Mike is right there.

383
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,889
You just
need to open the door for him.

384
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,892
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay. You got this, Pam.

385
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:28,726
Okay.
Okay.

386
00:15:28,727 --> 00:15:30,495
I'm gonna reach over.

387
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,130
I'm gonna...

388
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,133
I'm gonna unlock it, okay?

389
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,902
It started beeping.

390
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,403
Do you hear that?
Why is it beeping?

391
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,338
It's beeping.
Why is it beeping?

392
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,573
Uh, don't worry about that, Pam.
Just open the door, okay?

393
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,335
Just open that door.

394
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,125
Nolan: Go get those kids
out of here!

395
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:00,126
Celina: Okay.

396
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:01,860
- This is crazy.
- It's crazy.

397
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,961
Girl: Yo, this is
so crazy, yo. Wait.

398
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,929
We were just skating.
Look, look.

399
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,032
Look at this.
Look at this.

400
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,932
I need you all to back up
another 10 yards.

401
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,668
<i>Yo, Officer, what happened?
I heard a lady blew up?</i>

402
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,638
We're not sharing
any information at this time.

403
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,639
Back up!

404
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,149
<i>I pushed back
the perimeter.</i>

405
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,149
<i>Good.</i>

406
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,317
<i>Do you think
she felt it?</i>

407
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,385
<i>Her death?
Yeah.</i>

408
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,787
<i>No.</i>

409
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:31,322
But everything up to that point
was torture.

410
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,790
What'd the bomb squad
say?

411
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,125
They confirmed what
we already suspected.

412
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,626
<i>Device appears
to be homemade</i>

413
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:37,395
<i>using items you can find
at any hardware store.</i>

414
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,030
<i>Do they know what
triggered the explosion?</i>

415
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,899
<i>Most likely, the device
was on a timer,</i>

416
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:42,567
<i>but they need to put the bomb
back together to be sure.</i>

417
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:44,669
<i>Ah, that's gonna be
a hell of a jigsaw puzzle.</i>

418
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,139
<i>I'm sure videos are already
popping up on social media.</i>

419
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,807
<i>And the news choppers
are already here.</i>

420
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,878
Okay, well, if her car and her
license plate get leaked online,

421
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,513
<i>it's not gonna be long
till her name does, too.</i>

422
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,182
<i>Ohh, I can't imagine
finding out something</i>

423
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,518
<i>about someone I love
like this on ClipTalk.</i>

424
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,220
<i>We're not gonna
let that happen.</i>

425
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,089
<i>Nolan, I want you and Juarez
to go to the victim's house.</i>

426
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,089
<i>Right.</i>

427
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,194
<i>Who would do
something like this?</i>

428
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,201
It's officially
a homicide.

429
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,170
Was anyone else
injured?

430
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,338
Nothing serious.

431
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,840
That's strange, right?

432
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:25,443
I mean, bombs are usually
for mass-casualty events.

433
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,380
If you want to kill one person,
a gun is a lot easier.

434
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,116
They didn't just want her dead.
They wanted her terrified.

435
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,288
Hold on. I just got video
footage from Pam's house.

436
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:43,996
Can't see his face.

437
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:49,000
Alright. The garage camera's
triggered 7 minutes later.

438
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,140
Is there
any other angle?

439
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,441
No, that's it.

440
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:57,477
Wait, wait.
Go back real quick.

441
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,612
Yeah. I feel like
she recognizes him.

442
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:02,213
Yeah, she doesn't
seem scared.

443
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:05,750
Whoever he is,
she wasn't expecting trouble.

444
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,619
Alright, mother's name is
Marianne Winfield.

445
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,423
62, works in PR, and...

446
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,594
man, she's about to receive
the worst news of her life.

447
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,462
Alright.
I'll do the talking.

448
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,565
It's better
if only one of us speaks.

449
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,965
That way,
the person can focus

450
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,334
a little easier
on what we're telling them.

451
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,102
Well, I can do it.

452
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,636
You sure?

453
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:28,273
I have to make my first
death notification sometime.

454
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:31,343
Might as well be today.

455
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,010
Okay.

456
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,680
Don't speak
in euphemisms.

457
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,648
No "passed on"
or "in a better place."

458
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,917
Just be direct.

459
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,420
"We have bad news.

460
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:44,122
Your daughter Pam was killed
today in an explosion."

461
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,923
You know, when the police
told my mom

462
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:49,494
that they'd recovered my sister,
they said, "We found her."

463
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:52,365
And for a second,
we thought...

464
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,366
So you understand
how important this is.

465
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,836
Yeah. I do.

466
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,505
Okay.

467
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,313
Celina Juarez.
This is Officer John Nolan.

468
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,737
Lucy: That poor woman.

469
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:34,506
The last moments of her life
must have been agony,

470
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,541
just wondering if the bomb
was gonna go off,

471
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,709
praying it wouldn't.

472
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,510
I'm guessing
that was the point.

473
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,813
No way someone goes through
that much trouble of building

474
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:44,549
something like that unless they
want to terrorize their victim.

475
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,550
Yeah.

476
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:49,988
Hey.

477
00:19:49,989 --> 00:19:51,323
I saw the news.
Are you okay?

478
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,424
Yeah, I'm fine,
but it's crazy out here.

479
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:56,561
Okay. Look, if you
don't have time, I get it.

480
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,263
But a Realtor friend of mine
just slipped me a listing.

481
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,231
<i>It hasn't been
posted online yet.</i>

482
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,601
So, uh, if you like it,
I think we should move on it.

483
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,569
Wow. Um, okay.

484
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,905
Chen, chat with your boyfriend
on your own time.

485
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:10,276
He's in a mood.
I'll let you go.

486
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:12,510
Just text me and let me know
what you think?

487
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,945
Yeah, I-I'll do that.

488
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,718
Thanks.

489
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,689
Pam Winfield was an in-house
counsel at Sunvale Oil

490
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,955
for the past five years.

491
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,857
Security e-mailed me
a list of people

492
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:28,727
who sent threatening letters
to the company.

493
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:32,431
The first guy lives
over on Orange Grove.

494
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,964
Alright, let's go
pay him a visit.

495
00:20:33,965 --> 00:20:36,801
How's the Tar Pits
case going?

496
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,305
I haven't been
thinking about it.

497
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:41,440
After what happened,
it seems kind of silly.

498
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,709
Part of being a detective
is juggling cases,

499
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,045
switching between
wildly different gears.

500
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:50,749
Okay. Um...

501
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,951
Okay. We have the boyfriend.
We have the artifacts broker.

502
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,288
Both have motive
to kill the guard.

503
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,289
I-I feel like I need to know
more about the theft.

504
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,460
Like, how did she get roped up
in this in the first place?

505
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,494
Is that
a fourth question?

506
00:21:03,496 --> 00:21:05,830
Yes. Did the guard
take the job at the museum

507
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,598
in order to gain access
to the artifacts?

508
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,934
It's hard to say,
but we <i>do</i> know

509
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,403
that her
black-market contact

510
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:13,605
was also her
high-school sweetheart.

511
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,240
<i>Another</i> love interest?

512
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,345
Okay.
Now we're getting somewhere.

513
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,986
This is a lot.

514
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:31,189
Watching her die,
having to tell her mother.

515
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,125
It's more than anyone should
have to deal with in a day.

516
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:36,193
But our shift
isn't over yet.

517
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:38,664
I know. I'm okay.

518
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,671
Hey. Where are you?

519
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,105
I'm under the house.

520
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:48,606
Why?

521
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:51,809
I keep hearing this noise,
and it's driving me crazy.

522
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,778
And you thought
it would be a good idea

523
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,480
to go under there
by yourself?

524
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:56,815
That's why
I FaceTimed you.

525
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,284
That's not the same.
It's not...

526
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,487
Wait. What is that?

527
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,820
What is what?
Aah!

528
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,855
Bailey?

529
00:22:05,156 --> 00:22:06,625
Bailey?! What is what?!
Bailey!

530
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,060
Sorry. False alarm.
It's just this guy.

531
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:12,230
Oh, God!

532
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,632
What is <i>that</i>
doing under there?

533
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:16,734
I don't know. Should I move it?
Yeah.

534
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:20,071
No! No! Not till
you consult an exorcist.

535
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,512
Look, if you don't want to
move in, just tell Chris that.

536
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,980
That's...

537
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,482
The question is,
<i>why</i> don't I want to move in?

538
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,719
I don't get what the problem is.
I mean, Chris is great.

539
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,488
We're great together.
We never fight.

540
00:22:36,489 --> 00:22:39,424
Maybe that's the problem.

541
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,358
Oh, you think we should be like
that couple from this morning?

542
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,327
No, I'm not saying that,
but... No.

543
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,762
But do you guys not fight

544
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:46,765
because you don't
disagree on things,

545
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:49,536
or because you don't think
it's worth the bother?

546
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,740
Lucy.
Yeah?

547
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,876
You deserve someone
who's worth the effort.

548
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:06,617
What was that?

549
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:11,923
He...

550
00:23:15,126 --> 00:23:17,729
Control, 7-Adam-100.
There is a second bomb.

551
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,230
Repeat.
There's a second bomb.

552
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,372
What's your name?!
Lucy: Hey!

553
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:31,742
Get me as close as you can, okay?

554
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,743
Tim: Right.

555
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,145
Hey. Reach out.

556
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:38,317
Reach out. Reach out. Okay.

557
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,121
Can you get closer?
Yeah.

558
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:44,288
Here, here, here.

559
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,490
Got it!

560
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,161
Hi. I'm Lucy.

561
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,329
Hi. H-He told me
to keep driving.

562
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,665
I don't want to die!

563
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,635
Sir, we're here to help you.
What's your name?

564
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:59,136
Creighton.
Creighton Mitchell.

565
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:00,605
Okay. Creighton,
we're gonna try

566
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,272
and get you to drive
somewhere safe.

567
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:04,009
You think
you can do that?

568
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,743
I can't breathe.

569
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:08,413
I feel like I'm dying.
I think I'm dying.

570
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,280
Creighton, you're probably
having a panic attack right now.

571
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,150
I just need you
to try and stay calm.

572
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:15,185
Maybe turn on the radio
for some music?

573
00:24:15,186 --> 00:24:17,087
Woman:
<i>A woman is dead today</i>

574
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,190
<i>after an unknown assailant
apparently strapped</i>

575
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,159
<i>an explosive device
to her neck.</i>

576
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,260
Oh, my God!
This happened to somebody else?!

577
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,029
And she's dead?!

578
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:24,997
Creighton,
listen to me.

579
00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:26,431
That is not gonna be you, okay?

580
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,767
You can bet your ass
this isn't gonna be me!

581
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,372
Creighton!

582
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,144
Creighton, stop!

583
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,479
<i>You could detonate
the device!</i>

584
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,980
I'm not just gonna wait
for this thing

585
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,115
to blow my head off!

586
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,884
<i>Everyone, back up!
Get inside the house! There's a bomb!</i>

587
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:49,621
<i>Back up! Clear it out!
Clear off the sidewalk! Let's go!</i>

588
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,060
Ow!

589
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,798
I'm alive!

590
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,138
Yeah, so the bomb
was on a timer.

591
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,575
He had 3 minutes left.

592
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,175
<i>It's a good thing he bailed
when he did.</i>

593
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,978
<i>We would have never
made it on time.</i>

594
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:14,311
<i>How long
did he have total?</i>

595
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,646
<i>Couldn't tell
from the device,</i>

596
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,682
<i>but as long as he was driving
plus 3 minutes.</i>

597
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,984
Okay, thanks. Bye.

598
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:21,920
What time was the device
activated?

599
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:24,489
Uh, I don't know.
Uh, a while?

600
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,523
He activated it right before
he put me in the car.

601
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,660
Alright, we'll get the GPS
off your car.

602
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,828
Lucy: What exactly can you
remember from this morning?

603
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,396
<i>I was going to work.</i>

604
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,900
<i>I-I-I heard a knock at the door
and when I answered it,</i>

605
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,568
<i>Richard was standing there
with a collar and a gun.</i>

606
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,871
Richard?
Dormer. Richard Dormer.

607
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,539
I-I used to work with
his sister at Sunvale.

608
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,875
Oh. Sunvale Oil?

609
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,744
Did you know Pam Winfield?

610
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:49,114
<i>Yeah. Why?</i>

611
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,516
<i>The woman they were talking about on
the radio this morning,</i>

612
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:52,750
<i>uh, that was Pam.</i>

613
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:54,451
<i>What?!</i>

614
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:57,923
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.
Were you close?</i>

615
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,457
<i>I-I-I mean,
I-I worked with her.</i>

616
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:01,593
<i>Wh-What is this?
What's going on?</i>

617
00:26:01,594 --> 00:26:04,796
<i>That's what we're trying
to figure out here.</i>

618
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,564
<i>What did Richard
say to you?</i>

619
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,266
<i>He told me if... if I didn't
put the collar on,</i>

620
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,366
<i>he'd kill me.</i>

621
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,402
<i>And he didn't
give you any reason?</i>

622
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,203
<i>It was all so fast.</i>

623
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,640
<i>I-I-I don't know.
I don't know.</i>

624
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:16,240
Uh, do you have
his sister's number?

625
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,108
She might be able
to give us some insight.

626
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,012
<i>No, no.
She's... She's dead.</i>

627
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,016
Do you know
what happened?

628
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,385
<i>We...</i>

629
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,454
<i>We sent her abroad
to handle a deal,</i>

630
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:34,861
<i>and she was kidnapped
and... she was killed.</i>

631
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:38,797
How were you and Pam
involved?

632
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,332
<i>It was our call,</i>

633
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:42,733
<i>whether or not
to pay the ransom.</i>

634
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,670
<i>I mean... And we were
going to, I-I swear.</i>

635
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:46,403
But, you know,
you negotiate these things.

636
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,074
You... It's how you do it.
They expect you to do it.

637
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:52,844
But these guys, they panicked
or... I don't know.

638
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:57,182
<i>All I know is...
she died over there.</i>

639
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,285
7-Adam-15, I need you
to pick up Richard Dormer.

640
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:03,020
Proceed with extreme caution.
He might be our bomber.

641
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,958
Stay alert.
Watch his hands.

642
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:12,462
Richard Dormer, keep your hands
where I can see them!

643
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:14,464
Is this all for me?

644
00:27:14,465 --> 00:27:15,967
Turn around.
Get on the ground.

645
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,202
<i>I'm unarmed.
I know how this ends.</i>

646
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,805
I don't mind
going to prison.

647
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,472
Turn around and get
on the ground, now.

648
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:27,011
Lopez: We need the bomb squad
to do a search

649
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,445
before we process
the house.

650
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:31,481
<i>You don't have to be afraid.
The explosives are gone.</i>

651
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:33,483
The third bomb's
already out there.

652
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,654
Harper: <i>Apparently there were
three people who signed off</i>

653
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,557
on negotiating rather
than paying the ransom...

654
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:40,625
Pam, Creighton,

655
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:42,894
and Henri Parsons,
the company CEO.

656
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:45,230
You have a phone number?
Yes, but he is not answering.

657
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,798
Lopez is getting authorization
to track it as we speak.

658
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,299
Alright, well,
based on Creighton's GPS,

659
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,969
he had 43 minutes
from the time

660
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,470
<i>the bomb was activated
until it was detonated.</i>

661
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,404
Why 43 minutes?

662
00:27:54,405 --> 00:27:55,906
You're the detective.

663
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,375
Okay. Henri drives
a black BMW 5 Series,

664
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,576
and he lives
in Cheviot Hills.

665
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:01,378
We could head up there,
drive a grid.

666
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,015
<i>It's a start.</i>

667
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,317
Okay. I guess we should pick up
a pair of garden shears.

668
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,820
Don't think we can
rely on that working again.

669
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:10,989
Yeah.

670
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:16,493
More home listings?

671
00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:17,494
Yeah.

672
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,829
Oh, you've
gotta be kidding me.

673
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,032
This one's in Monrovia.
Who wants to live in Monrovia?

674
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,470
It looks like Chris does.

675
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:31,477
Do you love him?

676
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,717
I mean, we haven't even
been dating that long.

677
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,718
It's not...

678
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:49,294
He loves you.

679
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:51,429
I know.

680
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,265
I know, and I feel like
I should love him back.

681
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,467
He's so great
in so many different ways.

682
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,635
It's just...

683
00:28:58,636 --> 00:29:00,672
He's just not...

684
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,119
You know, you killed
an innocent woman today.

685
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:16,753
There was nothing innocent

686
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,955
about Pam Winfield.

687
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,458
She got what she deserved.

688
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:24,128
She experienced exactly what
she forced my sister

689
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,896
to experience...

690
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:30,836
43 minutes of terror
and then darkness.

691
00:29:30,836 --> 00:29:32,237
What do you mean?

692
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:35,105
Where she was abducted,
where they held her,

693
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,974
and where she died.

694
00:29:36,976 --> 00:29:39,144
It took 43 minutes

695
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:40,912
to drive her out to the desert

696
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,448
to be executed.

697
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:46,517
<i>Kidnappers</i> killed
your sister.

698
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,486
It wasn't Pam's fault

699
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:50,255
or Creighton's fault
or Henri's!

700
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:52,289
She trusted them!

701
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,959
She believed their promises

702
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,528
that if anything happened,
they would have her back!

703
00:30:01,968 --> 00:30:05,635
You know, every single person
in that company is guilty.

704
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:07,137
Every single one.

705
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,207
They all knew
she was taken,

706
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:11,342
and not one person
fought for her.

707
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,676
Not one.

708
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,311
People she worked with
for years

709
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,548
just sat on their hands
and let her die.

710
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,486
Henri's not just
driving around randomly

711
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:22,686
like the others,
is he?

712
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,028
Now, I've been assuming
foul play,

713
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:32,630
but maybe the victim
committed suicide

714
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:36,166
or got drunk
and had an accident.

715
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:39,505
Was there a question in there?
You've only got one more.

716
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:43,508
No. No, there's not.

717
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,045
Nolan,
what do we got?

718
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,846
The third victim isn't just
randomly driving around.

719
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:51,816
He's on his way
to Sunvale Oil offices.

720
00:30:51,817 --> 00:30:54,220
The third bomb's gonna
take out the whole company.

721
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,499
Stay with him.

722
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Yeah.

723
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,073
Nolan:
<i>Keep moving. Keep moving.</i>

724
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:16,634
<i>The far side of
the parking lot. Keep...</i>

725
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:22,613
<i>Control, 7-Adam-15.
I've located our third victim.</i>

726
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,950
<i>Corporate offices, Sunvale Oil.
He's confirmed on site.</i>

727
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:31,689
Celina: <i>Nolan's inside
with the bomb.</i>

728
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,090
We need to clear
the building.

729
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:43,634
We need you to clear out. Move.

730
00:31:43,634 --> 00:31:45,135
Everyone, listen up!

731
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,971
We have a credible threat
at this location!

732
00:31:46,972 --> 00:31:49,140
<i>I need everyone
to move with purpose!</i>

733
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,641
Aaron: <i>Come on. Everybody
move quickly but stay calm.</i>

734
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,109
Let's go. This way.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

735
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:54,270
Let's spread out and make sure
there are no stragglers.

736
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:58,615
Mr. Parsons. Mr. Parsons.
Hey. I'm John Nolan.

737
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,917
<i>Help me.
Please help me.</i>

738
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,253
That's why I'm here.
That's why... What's this?

739
00:32:03,255 --> 00:32:05,623
He... He told me
to stream an apology.

740
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,657
Okay. First, we're gonna get
all these people out of here.

741
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,394
<i>Folks, come on.
We're gonna move outside.</i>

742
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,561
No. He told me
not to let them go.

743
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,230
He said he'd kill me
if they left.

744
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:15,932
<i>Relax. Okay? No... You've been
told a lie. Okay, folks?</i>

745
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,669
The bomber is right now
outside in my car.

746
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:22,406
I can guarantee he does not have
a remote trigger with him.

747
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,907
This bomb is on a timer.

748
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:24,942
<i>You're sure?</i>

749
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:26,510
<i>100%.
Nice and safe, guys.</i>

750
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,313
<i>Everyone move outside.</i>

751
00:32:27,314 --> 00:32:28,413
Downstairs.

752
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:29,347
The far side
of the parking lot

753
00:32:29,348 --> 00:32:30,480
as fast as you can, alright?

754
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:31,982
Quick and safe.

755
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,984
<i>How long ago did he put
this bomb on your neck?</i>

756
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:35,452
<i>Huh? Uh...
You gotta think, okay?</i>

757
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,022
<i>The timer is for 43 minutes,
so you have to think.</i>

758
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,157
How long ago did he put this
on your neck?

759
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,192
Uh... uh...

760
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,327
More than a half-hour.

761
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,961
Uh, maybe 40 minutes?

762
00:32:44,962 --> 00:32:48,432
Okay. That's... not great.
It could be worse.

763
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,602
<i>Everyone out!
Come on, ladies. Move, move!</i>

764
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:52,802
What about me?

765
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,374
You and I, we're gonna
focus on this bomb, okay?

766
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,343
<i>Let's take a look here,
see what we've got, alright?</i>

767
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,178
<i>Stay nice and calm
for me.</i>

768
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,779
Tell me how to
disarm the bomb.

769
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,048
No.

770
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,615
My T.O. is up there,

771
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,852
and he's not gonna leave
someone who is scared and alone.

772
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:10,055
If that bomb goes off,
you're killing him, too.

773
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:12,057
Yeah, well, he's making
a choice to stay.

774
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,657
And you're making a choice
to kill people.

775
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,027
There have to be
consequences!

776
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:19,329
My sister is dead.
They need to pay.

777
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,832
Look, I get it.
Nolan: <i>This is the hinge point.</i>

778
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,701
My little sister was taken away
from me a long time ago,

779
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:26,002
and I spent
most of my life

780
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:27,471
thinking of all
the different ways

781
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,140
I would hurt
the person responsible.

782
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:31,976
But all that hate
just ate away at me

783
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:34,010
until I didn't
recognize myself.

784
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,346
Your sister
wouldn't want this.

785
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,148
<i>Okay.</i>

786
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:41,152
<i>This is entirely smooth.
I can't get in from the back.</i>

787
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:43,721
I want my apology.

788
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,191
I want him to admit
what he did

789
00:33:46,192 --> 00:33:48,393
for the whole world
to hear.

790
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:49,660
Where does this go?

791
00:33:49,661 --> 00:33:51,229
Is the bomb squad coming?

792
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,730
Yeah, any minute now.

793
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,231
I only have a couple
of those left.

794
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,532
"We."

795
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,501
I'm staying with you
till we figure this out.

796
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:00,770
<i>The floor is clear.</i>

797
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:03,108
<i>We should go.
The bomb squad is almost here.</i>

798
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,442
<i>John?</i>

799
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,044
<i>Go.</i>

800
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,614
<i>You don't
have to do this.</i>

801
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,282
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

802
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,949
<i>Harper, go.</i>

803
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,295
Nolan:
<i>Not a good time.</i>

804
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,431
Richard says he'll tell us
how to disarm the bomb

805
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,032
if Parson just admits
what he did.

806
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,800
I didn't do anything.
I was negotiating.

807
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:34,739
Hey. Your semantics are
gonna get us both killed.

808
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,309
I'm sorry.

809
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:41,246
<i>We let her die.
It was my fault.</i>

810
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,813
I made the call.

811
00:34:42,813 --> 00:34:45,784
Susan Dormer is dead
because of me.

812
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:55,626
There's two wires in the back,
a red and a green one.

813
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:58,264
Cut the green wire.

814
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:09,673
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

815
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:10,740
He's lying.

816
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:11,976
What?

817
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:14,311
He doesn't want an apology.
He wants Parsons dead.

818
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:15,346
Cut the red one.

819
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:23,954
Are you sure?

820
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:25,289
Yes.

821
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:32,996
Okay. Nice and easy.

822
00:35:43,242 --> 00:35:47,043
Nolan: <i>Thank you.
And... thank</i> you.

823
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,512
<i>You saved my life today.</i>

824
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:52,483
<i>That kind of insight
in a rookie is... remarkable.</i>

825
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:56,721
You know, I...

826
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:59,324
I wouldn't be
making so much progress

827
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,092
without
such a great T.O.

828
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,661
Thank you again.

829
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,630
You know,
I wouldn't mind at all

830
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,666
if you repeated that
in front of Sgt. Grey.

831
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,702
Just saying, repeating things
is good in general.

832
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,304
Sgt. Grey, imagine...
Have you seen "Inception"?

833
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:15,806
I'll walk you through it.

834
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:19,009
Okay, so, I think
I solved your case.

835
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,811
You have one more question
you could ask.

836
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:22,045
Nope.
Don't need it.

837
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:24,914
Hmm. Cocky.
Alright, let's hear it.

838
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:27,217
Okay, so, the victim was dating
one of the scientists

839
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:29,052
who worked at the Tar Pits, right?

840
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,322
And she was part
of a smuggling ring

841
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,190
that sold artifacts
on the black market.

842
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:36,427
So, was it
a jealous lover

843
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,197
or a criminal enterprise
gone wrong?

844
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,500
Actually, it was both.

845
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:45,034
She was sleeping with both
the smuggler and the scientist,

846
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,306
and they found out
and they killed her together.

847
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:53,277
I think you have a <i>long</i> road
to detective, Officer Thorsen.

848
00:36:53,278 --> 00:36:55,112
Wait.
Was I at least close?

849
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,914
You had
five questions.

850
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,181
Right.

851
00:36:58,182 --> 00:37:00,851
And you never asked
the <i>a</i> of the remains.

852
00:37:00,851 --> 00:37:02,786
Well, no, no, no.
The... The... The file said

853
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,621
that she was 32
when she went missing.

854
00:37:04,623 --> 00:37:07,925
Right, but the bone
was thousands of years old.

855
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:09,927
You see, the Tar Pits
are constantly

856
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,561
turning up
ancient remains.

857
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,597
So in... in this case,

858
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,668
the killer was
a-a saber-toothed tiger.

859
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,070
Wait. What happened
to the missing guard?

860
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:23,307
Oh, she was found
in Mexico a year later.

861
00:37:23,309 --> 00:37:26,076
You see, you assumed
that there was a connection

862
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,213
between the female remains
and the missing woman. Yeah.

863
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:33,318
First rule of investigation...
Don't make assumptions.

864
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,793
Oh.

865
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,432
Looks like a toy store
threw up in our house.

866
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:50,067
Well, Jack got
two shots today.

867
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,402
I didn't want him to
associate me with needles.

868
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,438
Did he cry?

869
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,106
No.

870
00:37:56,106 --> 00:37:58,409
Did <i>you</i> cry?
That's irrelevant.

871
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,679
Not according to
our living room, it's not.

872
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,481
Doesn't Jack already have
a basketball hoop?

873
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:07,652
Well, yeah, but now
he's got an outside one

874
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:09,753
<i>and</i> an inside one...

875
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:18,429
Ohh.

876
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,130
I don't know how you deal with
watching him get shots so often.

877
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,534
Well, I know
it's for his own good.

878
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:28,172
I know I have to be tough
to show him how to be tough.

879
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,710
And... I fill him full of
ice cream right after.

880
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,981
Oh, you didn't tell me
<i>that</i> trick.

881
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:39,949
Because you want
to be his favorite.

882
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:42,318
I'm already his favorite.

883
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,159
Welcome home!

884
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,697
Thank you for cleaning off
all those cobwebs

885
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,699
and clown...
before I got home.

886
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,402
Can never clean that clown
off my mind, though.

887
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:58,969
Ugh.
Where is he now?

888
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,170
Outside.
Where he belongs.

889
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,139
Mm-hmm.

890
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,972
Oh, geez!

891
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:05,242
I couldn't help myself.

892
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,313
We are gonna take it
outside to burn.

893
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,815
The only way to kill
this kind of evil is by fire.

894
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:13,483
Nolan:
You got that right.

895
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:16,320
So, if it was just a doll,
what was making the noise?

896
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,525
Well, when I got off the phone,
I found something else.

897
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,994
A puppy!
Oh.

898
00:39:23,994 --> 00:39:27,364
This little guy was making
all that ruckus.

899
00:39:27,364 --> 00:39:28,266
Can we keep him?

900
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:30,333
No.
I'll just give him a bath.

901
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:33,369
No, I mean,
that's... that's not a puppy.

902
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,871
That's a coyote.

903
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:40,277
How did you get him
in a crate?

904
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:48,487
Hey. We need to talk.

905
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:51,121
Let me guess.

906
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:52,789
Chris wants to buy
a house in Chatsworth?

907
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:55,059
No.

908
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:59,262
Look, this clearly
isn't working out.

909
00:39:59,264 --> 00:40:01,931
I don't know why
you won't just admit it.

910
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,233
Unless... Is it guilt?

911
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,802
Is it because of
what Rosalind did to him?

912
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,938
Oh, like I'm the only one
that's stayed too long

913
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,739
when things
aren't working.

914
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,240
You dated
a lifeguard.

915
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,876
You don't even like
going to the beach.

916
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:14,277
This isn't about me.
Uh...

917
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,612
No, it's not.
This is not about me.

918
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:16,914
This is about you... Okay.

919
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,949
...staying in this
safe relationship...

920
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:20,985
because you're scared.

921
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:23,554
Of course I'm scared.

922
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,789
If we do this
and it doesn't work,

923
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:26,923
I'll have ruined

924
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,826
the most important
relationship in my life.

925
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:39,769
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said, um...
No. Um...

926
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,905
You're right.

927
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:44,574
So we should just keep going
the way we have been, right?

928
00:40:44,576 --> 00:40:46,175
It's not worth the risk.

929
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,182
Unless it is.

930
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:04,128
Do you want to get dinner
sometime?

931
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,431
Yes.

932
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:09,298
Yeah?
Yeah.

933
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,300
No. Uh...

934
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,137
I... S... Oh.
Okay.

935
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,306
No, no.
It's just, um...

936
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:20,043
Not yet.

937
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:23,648
I owe it to Chris to end things
the right way with him.

938
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:28,018
Ask me again.

939
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:29,855
Later. After.

940
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,157
Deal.

941
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,266
