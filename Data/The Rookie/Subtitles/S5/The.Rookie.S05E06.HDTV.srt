an out-of-the-box idea

that we did
our due diligence on,

887

it's worth pursuing.

888
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:15,453
From Macy's credit-card
statements, I mean,

889
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:17,748
you can tell she spent time
down in the marina district

890
00:30:17,834 --> 00:30:19,288
during the last six months.

00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:21,694

was meeting Winslow?

893

he lived his life around boats.

Maybe he got back
into drug smuggling.

895

I'd have heard if he got
back in the game.

I mean, catching him
has been my obsession.

897
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:34,365
Well, then maybe he found
a legit job in the marina,

898
00:30:34,475 --> 00:30:36,405

and fell in love.

close enough to Winslow

to deposit that money.
