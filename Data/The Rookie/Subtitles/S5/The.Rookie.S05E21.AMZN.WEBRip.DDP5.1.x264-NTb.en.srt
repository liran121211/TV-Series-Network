Special of the day:
Frank Teska.

39
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:13,041
Frank spent two decades

40
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:15,558
working his way up
from a street-level enforcer

41
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:17,798
to a proud boss
of a renaissance crew

the ghost gun business.

54

59
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:51,965

61
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:55,936
Now, this morning, METRO
raided Ridgeside Chemicals

62

was about to take a delivery

63

64
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:02,161
Which leaves Frank
without a supplier.

65
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:03,334
