Yeah.

886
00:39:47,592 --> 00:39:49,942
I'm fine.
[Laughs]

887
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:51,419
But there's something
I need to tell you.

888
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:53,603
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah. I was looking

889
00:39:53,598 --> 00:39:56,598
at your mom's accounts,
and, well,

890
00:39:56,601 --> 00:39:58,291
the bank's foreclosing
on the house.

891
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:01,812
She hadn't paid the mortgage
in a year. It's a done deal.

892
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:04,333
I'm sorry.

893
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:07,442
[Both laughing]

894
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:12,619
That... That is the perfect
ending to this whole debacle.

895
00:40:12,617 --> 00:40:15,787
Here you go. It's all yours.
We have a plane to catch.

896
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:17,312
I... What, what?

897
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:19,311
It was so nice to meet you.
Please come visit.

898
00:40:19,313 --> 00:40:21,493
We have lots of room.
Okay?

899
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:24,178
Got a delivery
for Evelyn Nolan.

900
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,420
Let me guess,
you got about $100,000 worth

901
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,564
of something ridiculous?

902
00:40:27,563 --> 00:40:28,913
My money's
on diet supplement.

903
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:30,639
I'm feeling...
food storage systems.

904
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:32,975
Ah.
Protein shakes.

905
00:40:32,982 --> 00:40:34,572
Can one of you sign
for the delivery?

906
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,570
No, no. Sorry. We don't know,
uh, Evelyn Nolan.

907
00:40:37,573 --> 00:40:38,923
No, you can talk to her, though.

908
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:40,749
Thank you, Stacy,
for everything. Bye.

909
00:40:40,748 --> 00:40:41,958
Run.

910
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:45,753
Jack's down for his nap.

911
00:40:45,753 --> 00:40:48,003
I don't know
if I'll ever sleep again.

912
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:49,447
Try not to worry.

913
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,477
We've got units parked
in the front and back 24/7,

914
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:55,944
and Garza sent
a very clear message to Elijah

915
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:58,656
that we're off-limits.

916
00:40:58,663 --> 00:40:59,913
You really think
he'll listen?

917
00:41:00,872 --> 00:41:02,492
For the near future,

918
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:06,024
while he figures out
how much exposure he's facing.

919
00:41:06,015 --> 00:41:07,875
Did you really threaten
to fight Elijah

920
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:10,019
in the street
with a claw hammer?

921
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:11,679
Grey heard it on the wire.

922
00:41:11,676 --> 00:41:14,606
I did.
But it was all a bluff.

923
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,540
I'd dust him from a thousand
yards with a 220 grain,

924
00:41:17,544 --> 00:41:20,204
disappear before the sound wave
even reached him.

925
00:41:20,201 --> 00:41:21,581
You're kidding, right?

926
00:41:22,928 --> 00:41:24,208
Yeah.

927
00:41:24,205 --> 00:41:25,965
Mm.

928
00:41:25,966 --> 00:41:27,726
I think if all else fails,
we should just break open

929
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:30,866
the trust fund,
just buy an island.

930
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,457
I'm not running.

931
00:41:34,457 --> 00:41:35,867
I know.

932
00:41:35,872 --> 00:41:37,742
But maybe we could buy
an island anyway.

933
00:41:37,736 --> 00:41:41,526
[Chuckles]
I'll send you some listings.

934
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:43,263
What about Abril?

935
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,917
I think we're in the clear
for now.

936
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,230
As far as she knows,
Daylin and the Sicarios

937
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:52,542
were sent right back home

938
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:54,414
because they're on
a federal watch list.

939
00:41:54,408 --> 00:41:56,238
Mm.
I can't imagine
she has any idea

940
00:41:56,237 --> 00:41:58,827
about the con
we just ran on Elijah.
