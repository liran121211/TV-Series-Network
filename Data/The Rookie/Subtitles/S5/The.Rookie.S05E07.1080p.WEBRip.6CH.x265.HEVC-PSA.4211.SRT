1
00:00:00,936 --> 00:00:03,873

2
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,019

3
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:23,692

4
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:26,328

5
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:29,664

6
00:00:29,698 --> 00:00:33,635
I have so many questions, I
don't know where to start.

7
00:00:33,668 --> 00:00:36,638
So I'll open with...

8
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:38,316
"Where you headed?" To
the bar on the corner.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,876
I'm taking my brother
for one last drink.

10
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,112
I'm sorry for your
loss. As am I.

11
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:45,047
But y-you can't just
be transporting a...

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,016
There is a body in
there? Yes, sir.

13
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,318
My brother Kenny.

14
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:52,154
Uh, who knows the next
time I'll see him, if ever.

15
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:54,589
If you know what I mean.
Yeah. No, actually,

16
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:56,525
I don't know what
you're talking...

17
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:58,269
I'm sorry. Could you open
the lid for us, please?

18
00:00:58,293 --> 00:00:59,661
Yeah.

19
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:01,296
Oh. We there yet?

20
00:01:02,497 --> 00:01:04,033
Your brother's
not dead. No, sir.

21
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,700
So why is he in a coffin?

22
00:01:05,734 --> 00:01:08,370
Oh, we just found it on the
side of the road a ways back.

23
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:09,847
Pretty cool, right?
Okay, but you said

24
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:11,883
it was the last drink and
you'll never see him again.

25
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:13,651
Yeah, well, he's moving
to the Valley tomorrow,

26
00:01:13,675 --> 00:01:14,944
so who knows? I just...

27
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:16,878
It's right behind my eyes.

28
00:01:16,912 --> 00:01:20,549
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh ♪ It's like a hot knife.

29
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:25,420
♪ I'm gonna win for you like
I know you want me to do ♪

30
00:01:25,454 --> 00:01:27,498

31
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:29,491
Alright, so, what do we have?

32
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:32,294
Ji-hoon Kim... 49,
liquor-store owner.

33
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:33,862
Two gunshots to the head.

34
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:35,864
Also has a fractured
jaw and bloodied ear.

35
00:01:35,897 --> 00:01:37,699
There were broken
bottles inside.

36
00:01:37,732 --> 00:01:39,201
He fought off a robber?

37
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:41,770
Or tried to. Looks like he
tried to make a run for it.

38
00:01:41,803 --> 00:01:43,438
Anyone see anything?

39
00:01:43,472 --> 00:01:46,208
Hey, Detectives. A C.I. of
mine says Double R did it

40
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:48,177
because our victim
wouldn't pay up.

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,779
Double R? Some new girl gang.

42
00:01:50,812 --> 00:01:53,348
I'm sorry, did he just act
like girls aren't dangerous?

43
00:01:53,382 --> 00:01:55,726
Yes, he did. In front of two
of the most dangerous women who

44
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,862
have ever walked this earth.
Who could have you assigned

45
00:01:57,886 --> 00:01:59,955
to traffic control on
the surface of the sun.

46
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,656
Officer Jan,
we need you inside.

47
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,993
Uh, yeah, Copy
that. I'm on my way.

48
00:02:04,026 --> 00:02:05,927
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You better run.

49
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:07,429

50
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:10,499


51
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:11,833
Good morn...

52
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,535
Oh. Good morning.

53
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,770
Sorry. Ignore me.

54
00:02:15,804 --> 00:02:17,839
Please continue.
We need to talk.

55
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:20,475
That's never a good
start to a conversation.

56
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,377
So, I've been
speaking with Celina.

57
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:23,945
Oh! I just discovered
a worse one.

58
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:26,181
The energy in your house is off.

59
00:02:26,215 --> 00:02:28,017
Our house. That's
really sweet,

60
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,284
but not the point.

61
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:31,086
Okay. I'm excited to
hear what the point is.

62
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,088
Ever since the engagement,
whenever I'm here,

63
00:02:33,122 --> 00:02:35,957
I feel off center, if
that makes any sense.

64
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:37,659
But I couldn't put
my finger on it.

65
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:39,794
But after talking to
Celina, we realized

66
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:41,696
that the wallpaper
color in the bedroom

67
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,532
doesn't line up with
your astrological sign

68
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:44,799
and the couch fabric

69
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,502
is completely counter
to your birth element.

70
00:02:48,537 --> 00:02:51,506
Okay, see, the plan was for
you to rub off on Celina,

71
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,807
not the other way around.

72
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:55,110
What about the blocked
energy? Oh, don't you worry.

73
00:02:55,144 --> 00:02:57,879
I'll talk to Celina today all
about that blocked energy.

74
00:02:57,912 --> 00:02:59,981
Bye!  Love you.

75
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:02,484
Okay. That's it.
Be safe out there.

76
00:03:02,517 --> 00:03:04,086
But before you leave,
one more thing,

77
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:05,787
what you've all
been waiting for.

78
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,256
So, I'll make this quick.

79
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,758
Pay raises from the
last union negotiation

80
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,959
have gone into effect.

81
00:03:10,992 --> 00:03:12,294
- Yeah.
- Yay.

82
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:13,362

83
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:15,630


84
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:18,100
Check your pay stubs,
and we'll see what...

85
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:20,278
You're interrupting a briefing.
Are you Sergeant Wade Grey?

86
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:22,871
No. That'd be me.

87
00:03:22,904 --> 00:03:25,540
You've been served.

88
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:29,211
"Elijah Stone vs. The
City of Los Angeles, LAPD,

89
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:32,281
Wade Grey, Wesley Evers,
and Angela Lopez."

90
00:03:32,314 --> 00:03:37,786


91
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,854
A civil suit and
a Pitchess motion.

92
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:42,324
Alright. Briefing's over.

93
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:44,093


94
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:45,494
What's a
Pitchess motion?

95
00:03:45,527 --> 00:03:47,829
It's a request to see
a cop's personnel file.

96
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:50,432
Everything... IA complaints,
even the bogus ones.

97
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:53,535
It's a great way to,
uh, block energy.

98
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:56,004
Why don't you go set up the
shop. I'll meet you out there.

99
00:03:56,037 --> 00:03:58,173
Hey, union rep.
Anything you can do to help?

100
00:03:58,207 --> 00:03:59,550
Not much I can do
about the lawsuit.

101
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:01,276
As far as the
Pitchess motion goes,

102
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,378
I can call the City
Attorney's office right now

103
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:05,123
and make sure they're
following POBR on that.

104
00:04:05,147 --> 00:04:06,215
Thanks.

105
00:04:06,248 --> 00:04:07,725
I've been hit with
20 Pitchess motions

106
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:09,384
and never had a judge grant one.

107
00:04:09,418 --> 00:04:10,461
Yeah, but if it is granted,

108
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:12,154
Elijah can use it to
support his claims

109
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:14,356
of "violation of civil rights,

110
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:16,625
false arrest by a peace
officer with a warrant,

111
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:18,693
racial profiling,
civil conspiracy."

112
00:04:18,727 --> 00:04:20,262
This is unbelievable.

113
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:21,639
I mean, the guy is a
major drug trafficker.

114
00:04:21,663 --> 00:04:23,031
If he thinks he can sue

115
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:25,134
a defense attorney turned
prosecutor and win,

116
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:27,378
he doesn't know how badass my
husband is in the courtroom.

117
00:04:27,402 --> 00:04:29,171
Damn straight. Uh, you
want to take a minute,

118
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:31,173
or should we ask about Chen?

119
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,877
What about Chen?

120
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,512
We caught a D.B. this morning,

121
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:40,115
a shopkeeper who refused
to pay protection money

122
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,950
to a street gang
called Double R.

123
00:04:41,983 --> 00:04:43,485
Rowena Razors out
of Rowena Gardens?

124
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:45,287
Gang task force doesn't
have much on them

125
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,456
except their leader,
Shana Quelli.

126
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:49,434
She was released from Valley
State Prison three months ago.

127
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,860
She's been extorting
store owners on her turf.

128
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:53,104
Our victim
took a stand,

129
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:55,630
and the Razors made
an example out of him.

130
00:04:55,664 --> 00:04:57,532
Harper and Lopez need you

131
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:58,867
to infiltrate the gang

132
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,303
to get some evidence,
murder weapon.

133
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:02,971
A confession would be best.

134
00:05:03,004 --> 00:05:05,507
Uh... they're not going to
let me anywhere near them.

135
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,542
You're U.C. now, right?

136
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:09,520
Gaining access and building
trust is the name of the game.

137
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:13,047


138
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:14,383
You got it.

139
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:15,984
I'll figure it out.

140
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:19,321

141
00:05:19,354 --> 00:05:20,765
Hello, ma'am. We
had a noise complaint.

142
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:22,191
Yelling. Everything okay?

143
00:05:22,224 --> 00:05:24,193
I was just arguing with my son.

144
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:25,494
Ain't no need for the police.

145
00:05:25,527 --> 00:05:28,029
Okay, so what's
the problem, ma'am?

146
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,097
My son, Tabin. Mm-hmm.

147
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,532
He won't listen.

148
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:33,168
He cuts school. He won't
pick up after himself.

149
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,869
And the mouth on that boy.

150
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:36,805
And how old's your son? 15.

151
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:38,440
He threaten you? He
knows he better not!

152
00:05:38,473 --> 00:05:41,543
Okay. Any drugs, weapons,
other criminal behavior?

153
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,478
Tabin? Absolutely not.

154
00:05:43,512 --> 00:05:44,846
I see him drifting.

155
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,182
He's running the streets
instead of doing schoolwork.

156
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:49,951
Told him he's gonna
end up like his sister.

157
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:52,086
I already lost one child.

158
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,488
I'm not gonna lose another.

159
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:55,032
And let me guess... He didn't
want to hear that, huh?

160
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:56,667
He says I don't know
what I'm talking about.

161
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,927
Starts yelling and...
and slamming doors.

162
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,196
I told him, "You break my house,

163
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,498
I'mma break your head."

164
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:06,268
Okay. Well, we can't arrest him
if he hasn't committed a crime.

165
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:08,270
Ain't nobody asking
you to do all that.

166
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:11,273
You can't talk to him, put
the fear of Jesus in him,

167
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:12,707
help keep him out of trouble?

168
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:14,343
I pay your salaries.

169
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:17,879
You know what? We
should defund y'all ass.

170
00:06:17,912 --> 00:06:19,948
Look, um, I-I'll
talk to him, okay?

171
00:06:19,981 --> 00:06:21,015
Is he inside?

172
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:22,284
Mm-hmm.

173
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:23,418

174
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,263
She did not call the cops on me.

175
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:35,697
Ma! Hey, hold on.

176
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,532
It's... It's alright.

177
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:38,667
Tabin, right?

178
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,201
Officer Thorsen.
Call me Aaron.

179
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:42,136
She's crazy, okay?

180
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,706
Your mom didn't call us, okay?
But she is worried about you.

181
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:47,208
What am I supposed to do?
Stay cooped up in here?

182
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:48,610
I-I want to live my life.

183
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,011
Right, and she wants you

184
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:52,614
to live a long and good
life, too. All moms do.

185
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,825
You know, it's just, sometimes,
they can trip about everything.

186
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,060
Listen. I know how
you feel, okay?

187
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:58,620
My mom, she's a
piece of work, too.

188
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:01,690
Sometimes I feel like she's
the kid and I'm the adult.

189
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:03,358
Yeah. Yeah. You know.

190
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:05,660
Right. But you still got
to show her respect, okay?

191
00:07:05,694 --> 00:07:07,362
No matter how angry you get.

192
00:07:07,396 --> 00:07:08,963
When I was your age,
I was angry, too.

193
00:07:08,997 --> 00:07:11,866
Listen to her, right? If
you get upset or whatever,

194
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,768
just take a beat
before answering.

195
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:15,804
I mean, she changed
your diapers, man, okay?

196
00:07:15,837 --> 00:07:16,971
You owe her that.

197
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,343
I hear you. Anything
else bothering you?

198
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:22,944
Kids at school? Nah.

199
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:24,613
You use? No, sir.

200
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:26,548
Good. Any gangs
pressuring you to join?

201
00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:29,183
No, no.

202
00:07:29,217 --> 00:07:30,952
Here's my card, alright?

203
00:07:30,985 --> 00:07:33,154
It's got my cell on it.

204
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,324
Anything stresses you out,
you give me a call, okay?

205
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:37,526
But no more slamming
these doors. You feel me?

206
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,593
Yes, sir.

207
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:39,961
Alright.

208
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:45,634
Yeah, as their union rep, I
just wanted to touch base.

209
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:48,303
Thank you very
much for your time.

210
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:49,714
What'd they say about
the Pitchess motion?

211
00:07:49,738 --> 00:07:52,206
That Lopez's and
Wesley's marriage

212
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,042
is going to complicate things.

213
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:56,110
Elijah's gonna try
to prove prejudice.

214
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:57,512
He may actually have a case.

215
00:07:57,546 --> 00:07:58,680
Yeah, that's not good.

216
00:07:58,713 --> 00:08:00,382
No, that's not good at all.

217
00:08:00,415 --> 00:08:04,085
Uh, now, what was Bailey
talking to you about,

218
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:06,187
uh, our house's
energy being blocked?

219
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,856
Okay, look, she came
to me for advice.

220
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:09,129
And you suggested redecorating?

221
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,092
 Okay, look,
it's more than that.

222
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,961
It's about having your
home's energy line up

223
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:14,529
as you build a home together.

224
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:16,665
It's that couch.
She hates the couch.

225
00:08:16,698 --> 00:08:18,976
Definitely the couch. It's like
a positive-energy black hole.

226
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,001
I'd start there.

227
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:21,035
"Start"?

228
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:25,115
Enjoy.
Have a great day.

229
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,007
Thank you.

230
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,709
Double latte, cranberry scone?

231
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:30,044
 You know me well.

232
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:33,047
Damn. He's taking

Elijah. What,
you following me?

236
00:08:37,986 --> 00:08:39,821
Well, I heard you come
here every morning.

237
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,856
Well, the best scone in town.

238
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,758
You know, I never
would have guessed

239
00:08:43,792 --> 00:08:46,661
from your sad, little office
or that beater that you drive

240
00:08:46,695 --> 00:08:47,962
that you're old-money rich.

241
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:51,866
What's it like having
generational wealth?

242
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,802
I don't care about money.

243
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:55,937
I care about justice,
the rule of law.

244
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,839
Spoken like someone
with a ton of money.

245
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,273
Hmm. Well, don't worry.

246
00:08:59,307 --> 00:09:01,376

It's been nice, but
you need to leave.

249
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:09,083
Your lawsuit's malicious.

250
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:10,519
I'm not leaving.
This is my spot.

251
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:13,121
Well, not anymore.

252
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:15,624
Given the fact that you
planted evidence on me,

253
00:09:15,657 --> 00:09:17,358
are married to a
police detective,

254
00:09:17,392 --> 00:09:20,028
and have the full force of
the D.A.'s office behind you,

255
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:22,497
it's easy to see how
you kept your job.

256
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:25,166
My only choice was to file a
restraining order against you.

257
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:26,435
The judge granted it.

258
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:28,002
This gentleman here
just served you.

Take the scone. That's
all you're gonna get.

264
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,453


265
00:09:44,486 --> 00:09:46,287

266
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,459

Now Mom has me grocery shopping.

Thanks a lot." Smile emoji.

272
00:10:02,203 --> 00:10:05,006
"What time's dinner?"

273
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,775
I think that kid's
gonna be alright.

274
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:09,177
Be careful. Puppies
are a lot of work.

275
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,812

276
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:12,547
What?

277
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:13,682
You just got a puppy.

278
00:10:13,715 --> 00:10:14,725
Meaning I'm blurring the lines?

279
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:17,285
Meaning protect
your personal space.

280
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:20,154
Lucy got a puppy over a year
ago. Now she's living with her.

281
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:21,923
I mean, as long as
his mom's a good cook.

282
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,793


283
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,795
Oh, hey. I ran a
record management search

284
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:28,296
on the Rowena Razors.

285
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:30,799
Here is everything from
the gang task force.

286
00:10:30,832 --> 00:10:33,267
They are playing catch-up.

287
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:35,169
I... This doesn't make sense.

288
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:38,106
I mean, criminal
history, arrest reports.

289
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,340
These girls are heavy hitters.

290
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,375
They've all done time
for meth trafficking,

291
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,444
attempted murder, manslaughter.

292
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:45,647
Why is the current
intel so light?

293
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,015
Well, you said it. Girls.

294
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:48,950
Everyone dismisses female gangs

295
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:51,252
as some sort of
throwback curiosity,

296
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:53,988
like the Pink Ladies.

297
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:55,332
And if they do take
them seriously,

298
00:10:55,356 --> 00:10:58,326
they are written off as
drug mules or prostitutes,

299
00:10:58,359 --> 00:11:00,037
not the ones who are
actually calling the shots.

300
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:01,763
This is what I was
trying to say earlier.

301
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:02,997
It's gonna be tough to get in.

302
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:04,274
They'll be a tight-knit
group, you know?

303
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:07,001
Suspicious of outsiders.
Yeah. No doubt.

304
00:11:07,035 --> 00:11:08,837
But don't make the same
mistake that men do

305
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,706
and write them off
as just little girls.

306
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,307
They're a real threat.

307
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:14,308
Well, so am I.

308
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,309


309
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:17,178

310
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:20,715
Remember, those stop signs
are there for a reason.

311
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:21,950
Drive safe.

312
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,151

313
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:25,787
 You know, here's
what's concerning me.

314
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,188
About what? Bailey.

315
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:30,759
She's feeling off-center
ever since she proposed.

316
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,627
It's not you. It's the
energy in your house.

317
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:34,195
Let's just say,

318
00:11:34,228 --> 00:11:35,673
for the sake of argument,
it's not about the couch.

319
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:37,131
Mm-hmm. I just don't like

320
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:38,475
that she doesn't feel
comfortable in our home.

321
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:40,034
Gun!

322
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:41,369
Police! Drop the gun!

323
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,171
7-Adam-15. Shots
fired at our location.

324
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:45,473
I need assistance.
Check on the victim.

325
00:11:45,506 --> 00:11:52,681


326
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:54,348

327
00:11:54,382 --> 00:12:02,382


328
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:08,462

329
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:10,765


330
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,101
Good boy.

331
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:14,669
Police. I know
you're in there.

332
00:12:14,703 --> 00:12:15,436
Throw the gun out.

333
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:18,940


334
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:20,308
Now step out nice and slow.

335
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:21,619
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

336
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:24,345

337
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:25,780
Turn around.

338
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:27,682
Hands on your head.
Step towards me.

339
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:28,817
Right there.

340
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,319
 Alright.

341
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:32,854
Nice dog.

342
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:34,789
Code 4. Suspect in custody.

343
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,124

344
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:39,661

345
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:41,462
He got what he deserved.

346
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:44,699
I'm sure you feel that way,
but no one deserves that.

347
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,100
He's dead. 

348
00:12:46,134 --> 00:12:47,802
Yeah, well, bullets
will do that.

349
00:12:47,836 --> 00:12:49,804
No, I mean, like, he's a corpse.

350
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:51,105
Skin's cold and pale.

351
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:52,707
The vessels in his
eyes are trucking.

352
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:54,619
I mean, I'd say he's been
dead for at least an hour

353
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:55,844
before she shot him.

354
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:58,546
Why would she shoot someone

355
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:03,591
You'll see
that little trailer

356
00:13:04,553 --> 00:13:05,320
halfway down on the left.
That's where I found her hiding.

357
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:06,756
Hello, sir.

358
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:09,792
Our victim is Alvin
Mitchelssen. He's an M.D.

359
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:12,594
He was working at a urgent
care center in Woodland Hills.

360
00:13:12,628 --> 00:13:14,830
This his residence? Yes, sir.

361
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:16,331
Any family? Uh,
he's got a wife

362
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:18,009
we're trying to get ahold
of. She hasn't picked up yet.

363
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:19,501
I had realized
there was no blood

364
00:13:19,534 --> 00:13:21,312
coming out of the bullet
holes, which was weird.

365
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:23,438
But then I saw blood
pooling on the seat,

366
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:25,675
and that's when I realized
he was already dead.

367
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,177
The M.E. found a stab
wound on his lower back.

368
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,855
They figure that's the
likely cause of death.

369
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,714
There was no blood
leading to the car.

370
00:13:31,747 --> 00:13:34,516
So we figure he was stabbed as
he was entering the vehicle,

371
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:36,451
but he was losing
blood so quickly,

372
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:39,154
he passed out before he was able
to drive himself to a hospital.

373
00:13:39,188 --> 00:13:40,823
Um...

374
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:42,124
Good work, both of you.

375
00:13:42,157 --> 00:13:43,935
 This guy must
have been a piece of work

376
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:46,195
for two people to set out
to kill him on the same day.

377
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:48,163
Uh, sir, would you mind

378
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:50,666
if Juarez and I continued
working this case?

379
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,878
I know you have your hands full
with the Elijah Stone stuff.

380
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:54,436
 I appreciate that.

381
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:55,838
Okay. You two work this.

382
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:57,515
Just keep me in the loop
with any developments.

383
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:59,341
Yes, sir. Head back.
Talk to the shooter.

384
00:13:59,374 --> 00:14:01,143
If we can figure out
why she wanted him dead,

385
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:02,311
maybe we can determine why

386
00:14:02,344 --> 00:14:03,789
someone else would
want him dead, too.

387
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:05,881
Got it. Um...

388
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:07,149
What am I charging her with?

389
00:14:08,483 --> 00:14:10,820
Um, desecration
of a human corpse?

390
00:14:10,853 --> 00:14:13,155
Right. But if she didn't
know it was a corpse...

391
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:14,423
Then it'd be attempted murder.

392
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:15,758
But... But without a victim...

393
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,326
Alright. Give me a second.

394
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:18,794
Bradford, we have a suspect

395
00:14:18,828 --> 00:14:21,864
who fired into an already
expired individual.

396
00:14:21,897 --> 00:14:24,133
Ooh, that's a tough
one. Could be murder one,

397
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,868
but maybe just
discharging a firearm.

398
00:14:25,901 --> 00:14:27,469
They either get a
trial or a ticket.

399
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:29,014
Thanks for nothing.
Uh, you know what?

400
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:31,006
I'll just call the D.A.'s
office when I get back.

401
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,208
I'm sure they've done
this a hundred times.

402
00:14:33,242 --> 00:14:35,310
May...

403
00:14:35,344 --> 00:14:37,312
Probably not a hundred.
That doesn't seem very...

404
00:14:37,346 --> 00:14:38,948
Yeah.

405
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:41,984
I could pose as a store
owner, get them for extortion.

406
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,820
No. We need them for the
murder. Keep looking.

407
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:47,422

408
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:48,791
Oh.

409
00:14:48,824 --> 00:14:51,493
What is it? One of the Razors,

410
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:53,195
Vina Cordon...

411
00:14:53,228 --> 00:14:55,330
There was a 4-15 called
at her house today,

412
00:14:55,364 --> 00:14:57,299
and Tim and Aaron took it.

413
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:02,137
Hey, you guys caught
a 4-15 this morning?

414
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:03,672
Yeah. It was cute.

415
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:05,140
Cute? All puppies are cute.

416
00:15:05,174 --> 00:15:07,877
 Until they borrow
your earrings and they lose one.

417
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,445
Yeah, the mom asked us to
talk to her 15-year-old son.

418
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:11,713
He's a good kid.

419
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:13,949
Aaron's protégé has been
texting him nonstop.

420
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:16,085
"Who should I take to
prom? What's good on Hulu?"

421
00:15:16,118 --> 00:15:17,853
Did the mom mention a daughter?

422
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:19,421
Yeah, she said she lost one.

423
00:15:19,454 --> 00:15:20,999
Didn't want her son to
end up the same way,

424
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:22,667
and I thought she meant,
like, O.D. or something.

425
00:15:22,691 --> 00:15:24,293
No. Uh, Vina Cordon.

426
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:25,861
She runs with the Rowena Razors.

427
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:28,130
R-2. We want to
put Lucy under,

428
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:30,432
but we can't find an in.
Your kid might be our ticket.

429
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:33,268
If your puppy vouches for
her, it can go a long way.

430
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:36,371
I don't know. Having a kid act
as a C.I. on his own sister?

431
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:37,849
I mean, they might
not even be in touch.

432
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,608
She doesn't have
any violent priors,

433
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:41,944
but we like the gang leader
for doing our shop owner.

434
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:43,879
Okay, so you're not
going after the sister.

435
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:45,623
The kid's a minor. We're gonna
need the mom's permission.

436
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,116
No, I-I'm not feeling that.

437
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:49,018
Why would we put him
in this situation?

438
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:50,853
I get it. But it's one intro.

439
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:52,163
It's not like it's
a buy or anything.

440
00:15:52,187 --> 00:15:54,656
Yeah, but it opens the door.

441
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:56,826
Isn't there another
way? There really isn't.

442
00:15:56,859 --> 00:15:59,037
Alright, look, how about we keep
an eye on the kid ourselves,

443
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:01,263
make sure he's safe?

444
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:02,531
If we don't do this,

445
00:16:02,564 --> 00:16:04,766
we risk letting a suspect
get away with murder.

446
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,970


447
00:16:08,003 --> 00:16:09,504
Understood.

448
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:11,106
Sure. Whatever you need.

449
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,876
Great. We'll set it up.

450
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:17,446
Well, do you want to tell us
why you shot Alvin Mitchelssen?

451
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:19,014
A few years ago,

452
00:16:19,048 --> 00:16:22,284
my dad hurt his back at work.

453
00:16:22,317 --> 00:16:27,122
And Dr. Mitchelssen gave
him opioids for the pain.

454
00:16:27,156 --> 00:16:28,457
And he just kept...

455
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:31,526
upping the dosage.

456
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,030
And I went and I told him,
"My dad is abusing the pills.

457
00:16:35,064 --> 00:16:36,465
He needs help."

458
00:16:36,498 --> 00:16:38,667
And Dr. Mitchelssen
just ignored me.

459
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:45,841
 My dad
O.D.'d three months ago,

460
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,843
and he would still
be around today

461
00:16:47,877 --> 00:16:49,778
if it wasn't for that monster.

462
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:51,713
Well, did you report him
to the medical board?

463
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:54,483
I did everything that
you were supposed to do,

464
00:16:54,516 --> 00:16:56,485
and no one cared.

465
00:16:56,518 --> 00:16:58,353
I wasn't gonna just
let him kill my father.

466
00:16:58,387 --> 00:16:59,654
He had to pay.

467
00:16:59,688 --> 00:17:02,091
And that is why I killed him.

468
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:04,526
And I am ready for whatever
consequences that may bring.

469
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,328

470
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:08,163
Well, Abby, I've got
some good news for you,

471
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:10,966
and I've got some
good news for you.

472
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,203
Dr. Mitchelssen was already dead
when you shot him this morning.

473
00:17:14,236 --> 00:17:15,604

474
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:17,706
Uh, I don't
understand. 

475
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:20,275
So I'm... I'm not being
arrested for murder?

476
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:23,445
No. We will be charging
you with vandalism,

477
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:26,681
discharging a firearm in public,
and mutilation of a corpse.

478
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:30,285
So I'm not gonna be spending
the rest of my life in prison?

479
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,755
No. After we process you,
you'll be free to go,

480
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:35,766
and someone will explain to you
how you can get your gun back.

481
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,793
Keep it. 

482
00:17:38,827 --> 00:17:40,038
Having it in the house
in the first place

483
00:17:40,062 --> 00:17:41,997
is what got me here.

484
00:17:42,031 --> 00:17:44,699

485
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:46,511
Look, it's a big decision.
You know, we don't usually

486
00:17:46,535 --> 00:17:48,870
involve minors, but
it's the only way.

487
00:17:48,904 --> 00:17:51,006
I knew this Shana
girl was nasty.

488
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,142
I told Vina, "Stay
away from her."

489
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:56,045
Is it dangerous? It's
just an introduction.

490
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:59,048
One meeting. But we'll be
set up on surveillance.

491
00:17:59,081 --> 00:18:00,515
You'll be there? Yes, ma'am.

492
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:03,485
And what do you think?
Is this a good idea?

493
00:18:03,518 --> 00:18:05,663
I think it's our best bet to
get Shana off of the streets.

494
00:18:05,687 --> 00:18:07,356
That's not what I asked.

495
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:09,091
Do you think he should do it?

496
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:11,961

497
00:18:11,994 --> 00:18:12,962
Yes.

498
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:15,931


499
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:18,767
If we can get Vina away
from Shana, then...

500
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,469
maybe she'll come back home.

501
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:21,870
I hope so, baby.

502
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:25,507
Alright. I'll do it.

503
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,708
Do I get a gun?

504
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:28,010
No.

505
00:18:28,043 --> 00:18:29,878
Do I at least get
to wear a wire?

506
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:30,946
No.

507
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,847
You guys are real cops, right?

508
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:35,684


509
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:37,286

510
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,089
Thank you for coming in. We
just had a few questions.

511
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:41,123
Would you like to sit?

512
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:42,357
Yeah.

513
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:47,462
First, uh, may I
say how sorry we are

514
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:48,797
for the loss of your husband.

515
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,333
Oh. Thank you.

516
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:52,501
I-I'm still in shock.

517
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:54,803
I can only imagine.

518
00:18:54,836 --> 00:18:56,671
When was the last time
you spoke with Alvin?

519
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:58,173
This morning.

520
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:00,175
I had a conference downtown,

521
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:03,112
so I left before him,
which is unusual.

522
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:04,846
He's usually out the door first.

523
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:08,183
Can you think of anyone who
would want to harm your husband?

524
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:09,985
I don't understand.

525
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:12,187
What do you mean,
harm my husband?

526
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:14,756
W-Well, he was stabbed.

527
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,125
Right before he was shot.

528
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:18,327
Somebody stabbed
him, then shot him?

529
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,761
Two people, we think.

530
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:21,196
At the same time? No.

531
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,931
So two different people
killed my husband?

532
00:19:22,964 --> 00:19:24,466
No, technically, just one.

533
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:26,301
None of this makes
sense. He's a doctor.

534
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:29,271
He... He dedicated his
life to helping people.

535
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:31,473
I-I knew he had heart problems.

536
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,551
That's what I thought you
were gonna tell me killed him.

537
00:19:33,575 --> 00:19:36,145
I-I don't understand why
someone would want him dead.

538
00:19:36,178 --> 00:19:37,846
So there's nothing
you could think of

539
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,457
that could lead to this?
I mean, no arguments

540
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:41,583
with co-workers, patients?

541
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:43,918
All his patients loved him.

542
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:46,988
Well, thank you very
much again for coming in.

543
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:49,158
And we are so sorry
for your loss.

544
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,293
 Uh,
Rich, would you show

545
00:19:51,326 --> 00:19:53,328
Mrs. Mitchelssen back
to the front desk?

546
00:19:53,362 --> 00:19:55,897
If we have any more
questions, we'll be in touch.

547
00:19:57,332 --> 00:20:00,169
Uh, please...

548
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:02,171
find whoever did
this to my husband.

549
00:20:02,204 --> 00:20:03,538
Of course.

550
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:08,177

551
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,212
Sounds like she didn't
really know her husband.

552
00:20:10,245 --> 00:20:12,147
Or he's a really good liar.

553
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:13,948

 Yo.

571
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:52,487
You didn't invite me?

572
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:54,856
What you want?

573
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:56,325
You Vina? Who are you?

574
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:57,826
UPS.

575
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:00,095
I got a special
delivery for you.

576
00:21:00,129 --> 00:21:02,030


577
00:21:02,063 --> 00:21:03,308
What the hell you
doing with my brother?

578
00:21:03,332 --> 00:21:05,167
Get over there.

579
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,504


580
00:21:12,542 --> 00:21:15,511


581
00:21:15,545 --> 00:21:17,356
Put that gun away. Is that
how you're gonna thank me

582
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,624
for saving your
brother from the cops?

583
00:21:18,648 --> 00:21:20,283
You a'ight? Yeah.

584
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:22,518
Man, you're wearing some
dumb genes in your family.

585
00:21:22,552 --> 00:21:24,296
Got some nerve to be
talking like that. Okay.

586
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,364
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

587
00:21:25,388 --> 00:21:27,790
Look, cops saw me boost a six.

588
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:29,359
They chase you? Two blocks.

589
00:21:29,392 --> 00:21:30,526
They would have caught him

590
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,595
if I didn't stop and
let him in my ride.

591
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:34,830
That's the last time
I help a kid in need.

592
00:21:34,864 --> 00:21:39,535


593
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:42,104
Can't blame her...

594
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:44,039
you rolling up on
a house like that.

595
00:21:44,073 --> 00:21:45,308
Could've been a drive-by.

596
00:21:45,341 --> 00:21:48,178
Yeah. Well, I like
to make an entrance.

597
00:21:48,211 --> 00:21:49,445
And exit, too.

598
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:50,780

599
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:52,282
Stay good, little man.

600
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:53,816
Peace.

601
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:56,252
Yo, chica.

602
00:21:56,286 --> 00:21:57,420
Mm-hmm. Chill.

603
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:59,822
Grab a drink.

604
00:21:59,855 --> 00:22:01,257
Alright.

605
00:22:01,291 --> 00:22:04,460


606
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:06,128
Promise me you're
not gonna freak out.

607
00:22:06,162 --> 00:22:08,664
I never freak out. I'm
a very calm person.

608
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:10,800
Don't even wo... Whoa.

609
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,368
This...

610
00:22:12,402 --> 00:22:14,637
This is so... much.

611
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,006
Are we... Are you... Are we
redecorating the entire house?

612
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,608
You said you weren't
gonna freak out.

613
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:21,611
Listen, there are just some samples
I wanted to look at together.

614
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:25,481
Okay, can we just talk about why
you're not comfortable at home?

615
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:28,117
I mean, this morning, you said
you've been feeling off-center.

616
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,353
I think we should try
to figure out why.

617
00:22:30,386 --> 00:22:32,522
I want you to be
happy everywhere.

618
00:22:32,555 --> 00:22:34,089
I am. Not entirely, though.

619
00:22:34,123 --> 00:22:36,959
You know this has nothing to
do with you. I'm just weird.

620
00:22:36,992 --> 00:22:39,004
Okay, well, maybe it doesn't
have anything to do with me,

621
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:42,131
and maybe it has something to
do with the house after all.

622
00:22:42,164 --> 00:22:44,367
What do you mean?

623
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,169
There's nothing of yours
there. It's all my stuff.

624
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:49,372
Today we'll go get
some of your things,

625
00:22:49,405 --> 00:22:52,275
bring it over to the house,
and then it'll be our place.

626
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:53,543
Thank you.

627
00:22:53,576 --> 00:22:55,221
Oh, come on. I'm sorry I
didn't think of it sooner.

628
00:22:55,245 --> 00:22:57,980
You know, there is
this one lounge chair

629
00:22:58,013 --> 00:22:59,449
that I love and
I've been missing.

630
00:22:59,482 --> 00:23:01,460
And every time you sit in it,
it feels like it's hugging you.

631
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:03,085
See? A hugging chair.

632
00:23:03,118 --> 00:23:04,596
That sounds like a
wonderful addition.

633
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,155
 Oh,
hey. Hey, girl.

634
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:07,290
How you doing? Hi.

635
00:23:07,323 --> 00:23:08,258
Yeah. Oh, this is nice.

636
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,792
Ooh.

637
00:23:11,227 --> 00:23:13,095
A-An investigation
had been launched

638
00:23:13,128 --> 00:23:14,630
by the Medical
Board of California.

639
00:23:14,664 --> 00:23:16,599
Dr. Mitchelssen was
racking up complaints,

640
00:23:16,632 --> 00:23:19,469
mainly about
over-prescribing opioids.

641
00:23:19,502 --> 00:23:21,937
He had all of his scripts
filled at just one pharmacy,

642
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:24,139
deep in the Valley. That's
not suspicious at all.

643
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:25,508
Mm-hmm. Alright.
Back to business.

644
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,344
Um, unless you two want
to handle the pharmacy,

645
00:23:28,378 --> 00:23:29,379
and I'll get the chair?

646
00:23:29,412 --> 00:23:31,647
 No,
no. Go, go, go.

647
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:32,982
Don't worry about the chair.

648
00:23:33,015 --> 00:23:35,785

649
00:23:35,818 --> 00:23:36,686

650
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,021
What's up? I got news.

651
00:23:39,054 --> 00:23:40,823
Elijah's Pitchess motion failed.

652
00:23:40,856 --> 00:23:41,933
He won't be able
to get his hands

653
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:44,494
on all the B.S. IA
complaints in your file.

654
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:46,662
But? But he decided
to file his own.

655
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:49,465
Against me? On what grounds?

656
00:23:49,499 --> 00:23:52,702
He claims you kicked him in the
nuts and slapped him around,

657
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:54,304
pulled his hair,
body-slammed him.

658
00:23:54,337 --> 00:23:56,939
Never happened, although now
I'm regretting my restraint.

659
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:59,442
I know. Hey, it's his
word against yours.

660
00:23:59,475 --> 00:24:00,943
He won't win.

661
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:02,621
We thought he'd spent
a lifetime in prison.

662
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:04,046
Now he's walking free.

663
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:05,415
Don't underestimate him.

664
00:24:05,448 --> 00:24:06,616

665
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:09,184
Listen, don't let
Elijah Stone get to you.

666
00:24:09,218 --> 00:24:10,420
You got this.

667
00:24:10,453 --> 00:24:13,255

668
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:14,700
You know, we keep it cool
like that. You want a beer?

669
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:17,126
Yeah.

670
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:19,662
♪ Money be da mission,

671
00:24:19,695 --> 00:24:20,663

672
00:24:20,696 --> 00:24:21,964

673
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:23,132
You from L.A.?

674
00:24:23,165 --> 00:24:24,367
Phoenix.

675
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,101
My cellie at Valley
State lives here,

676
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:27,537
so I'm crashing on her couch.

677
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:29,705
You were at Valley?

678
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:31,441
10 months.

679
00:24:31,474 --> 00:24:33,376
I did 24.

680
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,978
Who's your cellie?

681
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:37,980
Shawty Ross.

682
00:24:38,013 --> 00:24:39,114
I know Shawty.

683
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:41,150
You were cellies?

684
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:42,685
Hm.

685
00:24:46,055 --> 00:24:48,624
That says something.

686
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:50,593
Tell her I said what up.

687
00:24:50,626 --> 00:24:51,861
For sure.

688
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:53,596
Shawty's a C.I. on
D.O.J.'s payroll.

689
00:24:53,629 --> 00:24:55,264
She'll confirm Lucy's cover.

690
00:24:55,297 --> 00:24:57,600
Okay. Good. We should
pull Tabin out now.

691
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:59,435
No, he's fine.

692
00:24:59,469 --> 00:25:01,704
Sir, no, it's not. You
are endangering this kid

693
00:25:01,737 --> 00:25:03,281
all because it's good
for Lucy's career.

694
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:05,307
Excuse me?

695
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:07,877
time, walk
out a free woman.

696
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:10,346
Ain't no
surprise. Shawty don't play.

697
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,358
I shouldn't have said
No, she don't.

698
00:25:12,382 --> 00:25:15,685
So, what game you guys run?
Cars? Vike, goodfella, monkey?

699
00:25:15,718 --> 00:25:17,596
What's the deal? Drugs
bring too much attention.

700
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,264
Yo, what'd you say about my
sister? We stick to the shadows.

701
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:21,132
Yeah, let's just say we
in the security business.

702
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:23,459

703
00:25:23,493 --> 00:25:24,360


704
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:25,761
Hey!

705
00:25:25,795 --> 00:25:27,930

706
00:25:27,963 --> 00:25:30,666


707
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,968
Oh, yeah. You see it, huh?

708
00:25:33,002 --> 00:25:35,004
You see it?

709
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:38,441


710
00:25:38,474 --> 00:25:40,443
Put that away.

711
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:43,212

712
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,115
Are you good? Yeah, I'm good.

713
00:25:46,148 --> 00:25:47,950
Good? You just
got your ass beat.

714
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:50,085
Hell yeah, he got
his ass whupped.

715
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,763
Hey, look, take this.
Settle up with him later.

716
00:25:51,787 --> 00:25:52,522
Come on.

717
00:25:52,555 --> 00:25:57,760


718
00:25:57,793 --> 00:25:59,495
Nah. I'm... I'm good.

719
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:03,866


720
00:26:03,899 --> 00:26:06,035
Boy can't even hold a gun.

721
00:26:06,068 --> 00:26:08,137
Scared of a gun! 

722
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,505
"Nah. I'm good."

723
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:10,840

724
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:14,009


725
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:16,054
Alright. She's in. Let's
peel off. 

726
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:17,680
Roger.

727
00:26:17,713 --> 00:26:19,281

728
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:27,314


729
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:36,524


730
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:39,034
Come on.

731
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:45,475


732
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:57,110
Look, it may feel
like a big deal now,

733
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,431
but things like this always blow
over, okay? People will forget.

734
00:26:59,455 --> 00:27:00,823
You're just saying that.

735
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:02,634
Nah, it's true, man. You know
how many times I been beat up?

736
00:27:02,658 --> 00:27:03,793
Is that why you're so ugly?

737
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:05,461
Get off me!

738
00:27:05,495 --> 00:27:07,997
Get away from me!
Don't touch me!

739
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,265
Ma'am! Where's
my son?! Where...

740
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:12,768
 I knew I
shouldn't have allowed this.

741
00:27:12,802 --> 00:27:14,169
You said it wasn't dangerous.

742
00:27:14,203 --> 00:27:15,947
It was just a little
dust-up with another teen.

743
00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:18,808
You call this a dust-up?
Well, I call it a screw-up.

744
00:27:18,841 --> 00:27:21,043
And what about Vina? You
put her in danger, too?

745
00:27:21,076 --> 00:27:22,454
Maybe I should tell
her what's going on.

746
00:27:22,478 --> 00:27:23,946
Ma'am, you can't do that.

747
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:25,948
You expose that we have
an officer undercover,

748
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:28,518
it'll jeopardize their
life and your son's.

749
00:27:28,551 --> 00:27:31,621
He's right. As soon as
Tabin made his introduction,

750
00:27:31,654 --> 00:27:33,098
I should have pulled
him out immediately.

751
00:27:33,122 --> 00:27:35,658
My son's done playing
cops and robbers.

752
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:37,993
You hear? Yes, ma'am.

753
00:27:38,027 --> 00:27:39,261
Come on, baby.

754
00:27:39,294 --> 00:27:46,301


755
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:49,004
With all those prescriptions
Dr. Mitchelssen was writing,

756
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:50,982
I mean, you'd think this pharmacy
would be a little busier.

757
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:52,174

758
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:58,514


759
00:27:58,548 --> 00:27:59,815

760
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,450

761
00:28:01,483 --> 00:28:06,455


762
00:28:06,488 --> 00:28:11,761


763
00:28:11,794 --> 00:28:13,596
Well, that's why
they don't look busy.

764
00:28:13,629 --> 00:28:14,997
They're shipping in bulk.

765
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:18,300


766
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:19,935

767
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:27,969


768
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:31,446

769
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,484


770
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:38,721

771
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,167
License and
registration, please.

772
00:28:42,191 --> 00:28:43,859
Uh, did I do something
wrong, Officer?

773
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:44,860
We'll get to that.

774
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:45,894
Alright.

775
00:28:49,164 --> 00:28:50,542
You mind telling me
what's in the van?

776
00:28:50,566 --> 00:28:53,202
Just, uh, making
some deliveries.

777
00:28:53,235 --> 00:28:54,536
Show me.

778
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:04,780
Ta-da! 

779
00:29:04,814 --> 00:29:06,315
Just some boxes.

780
00:29:06,348 --> 00:29:07,082
 Why
don't we open them up

781
00:29:07,116 --> 00:29:08,150
and take a look? Uh...

782
00:29:08,183 --> 00:29:10,119
I don't think I have to do that.

783
00:29:10,152 --> 00:29:11,353
Do I?

784
00:29:11,386 --> 00:29:13,589
Normally... no.

785
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:15,433
You wouldn't have to show
me what's in the boxes.

786
00:29:15,457 --> 00:29:18,594
But, the fact is, your pupils
are the size of pinholes,

787
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:20,996
and you can't seem to
stop licking your lips,

788
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,666
which makes me believe you're
driving under the influence.

789
00:29:23,699 --> 00:29:26,368
Now I can see
what's in the boxes.

790
00:29:26,401 --> 00:29:27,846
The law is so confusing.

791
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,038
Not if you don't break it.

792
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:30,205
Step back.

793
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:37,689
Did you know it's illegal to
possess prescription drugs

794
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:39,314
assigned to anyone else?

795
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:41,483
"Janet Wilson." I'm
guessing that's not you.

796
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:42,652
That's my nana. Mm.

797
00:29:42,685 --> 00:29:44,253
I'm her caregiver.

798
00:29:44,286 --> 00:29:46,521
Mm.

799
00:29:46,555 --> 00:29:48,123
"Thomas Jeffries."

800
00:29:48,157 --> 00:29:50,960
Poor Thomas. He's having
such a tough time.

801
00:29:50,993 --> 00:29:52,594
 Hands
behind your back.

802
00:29:52,628 --> 00:29:54,463

803
00:29:54,496 --> 00:29:57,032
What do you know about
Alvin Mitchelssen?

804
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:59,168
Never heard of him.
Dr. Alvin Mitchelssen?

805
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:01,804
Look, we've got a dead
doctor writing prescriptions

806
00:30:01,837 --> 00:30:03,538
getting filled out
at that pharmacy.

807
00:30:03,572 --> 00:30:06,508
And here you are, picking
up those very same scripts.

808
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:08,543
Whoa. Hold on. You're
not hanging that on me.

809
00:30:08,577 --> 00:30:10,145
Then who are we
hanging it on? Uh...

810
00:30:10,179 --> 00:30:12,982
Look, I noticed the
ink on your hand.

811
00:30:13,015 --> 00:30:16,151
Rolling Seventies? That's
a tough group of guys.

812
00:30:16,185 --> 00:30:17,763
I'm guessing they're gonna
sell these pills on the street.

813
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:19,154
You're just a middleman.

814
00:30:19,188 --> 00:30:21,123
Tell me this, though.
Any of those guys

815
00:30:21,156 --> 00:30:23,034
willing to do your time
for you if they were here?

816
00:30:23,058 --> 00:30:25,294
Mnh-mnh.

817
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:27,096
Come on, man. Just tell
us who's in charge,

818
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:28,339
and we'll keep your
name out of it.

819
00:30:28,363 --> 00:30:31,300

820
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:33,703


821
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:36,271
Callis Caputo, okay?
He did the doctor.

822
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:37,773
Where do we find this Callis?

823
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:40,009
This is a good party.

824
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,787
Except for my brother
getting his ass whupped.

825
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:43,278
Yo, my moms got him so whipped,

826
00:30:43,312 --> 00:30:44,956
he ain't ever gonna make
it on these streets.

827
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,124
I mean, ain't that a good thing?

828
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:48,517
Maybe he'll get to
live a regular life.

829
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,152
Doing what? Whatever he wants.

830
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,458
Yeah, what you know?

831
00:30:56,491 --> 00:30:57,760
Don't disrespect me.

832
00:30:57,793 --> 00:30:59,294
She ain't.

833
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:01,430
Sit down.

834
00:31:01,463 --> 00:31:03,165
I told you, you got to chill.

835
00:31:03,198 --> 00:31:04,834
'Specially after you know.

836
00:31:04,867 --> 00:31:06,769
What happened? You
nosy, you know that?

837
00:31:06,802 --> 00:31:08,437
Step off. 

838
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,705
That's Shawty's girl.

839
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:12,274

840
00:31:12,307 --> 00:31:14,509
We got to make a
run. Want to come?

841
00:31:14,543 --> 00:31:16,345
Yeah. Soon as I finish this.

842
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:18,647

843
00:31:22,684 --> 00:31:24,653

844
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:26,488

845
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:27,990
I already paid you.

846
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:30,960

847
00:31:30,993 --> 00:31:32,594
We're gonna be by
twice a week now.

848
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:33,528

849
00:31:33,562 --> 00:31:35,030
I-I can't pay that.

850
00:31:35,064 --> 00:31:38,167
That's what the liquor store
owner said. You heard about him?

851
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,634
"I can't pay."

852
00:31:39,668 --> 00:31:42,337
Even when I put a gun to his
head. He left me no choice.

853
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:44,339

854
00:31:44,373 --> 00:31:45,875
Okay.

855
00:31:45,908 --> 00:31:47,209
I'll pay you whatever you want.

856
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:49,578
You know what? Hey, man.

857
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:50,679
He said he could pay.

858
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:52,357
Don't interrupt me when
I'm doing business.

859
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:54,583
I already told you.
Do not disrespect me.

860
00:31:54,616 --> 00:31:56,285
Stop.

861
00:31:56,318 --> 00:31:58,020
The liquor store was enough.

862
00:31:58,053 --> 00:31:59,822
We don't need more blood.

863
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:01,166
And I told you to
get rid of that.

864
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,457
It's my lucky piece.

865
00:32:02,491 --> 00:32:03,625
Get rid of it.

866
00:32:03,658 --> 00:32:04,658

867
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:08,697
See you in a few days.

868
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,100

869
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:12,267

870
00:32:12,301 --> 00:32:17,907


871
00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:24,181
The City Attorney's offering
to pay you a settlement.

872
00:32:24,215 --> 00:32:26,283
You should take it.

873
00:32:26,317 --> 00:32:28,352
You know, I lost everything

874
00:32:28,385 --> 00:32:31,188
when I decided to help you get
your wife back from La Fiera.

875
00:32:32,723 --> 00:32:34,491
You turned me into a pariah.

876
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:36,327
Now I have to start
from the bottom.

877
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,862
But it's all good.

878
00:32:37,895 --> 00:32:39,964
I will win, and the
damages will be paid out

879
00:32:39,997 --> 00:32:41,698
from everyone's
personal accounts.

880
00:32:41,732 --> 00:32:46,003
Now, that may not
hurt you, Richie Rich.

881
00:32:46,037 --> 00:32:49,974
But it most certainly will
hurt Nolan and Harper and Grey.

882
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:54,145
Where they gonna find a half
a million dollars each, huh?

883
00:32:54,178 --> 00:32:57,648
I'll keep coming, adding more of
your little friends to my suit.

884
00:32:57,681 --> 00:32:59,250
I'll take everything
away from you

885
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:02,453
until you say sorry for taking
everything away from me.

886
00:33:02,486 --> 00:33:04,555
You want me to
apologize? To you?

887
00:33:06,123 --> 00:33:07,391
Something along these lines.

888
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,461
In public.

889
00:33:10,494 --> 00:33:13,998


890
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:16,667
And, Counselor,
make me believe it.

891
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:22,006


892
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,841
Sir, we I.D.'d a suspect
for our homicide.

893
00:33:23,875 --> 00:33:25,176
His name is Callis Caputo.

894
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:26,978
He's a member of the
Rolling Seventies.

895
00:33:27,011 --> 00:33:28,956
Yeah, he's holed up at his
shop, surrounded by his crew.

896
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,315
We need to be smart with how
we go about bringing him in.

897
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:32,583
This could get ugly.

898
00:33:32,616 --> 00:33:34,494

start trouble for weeks now.

1001
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,850
but I couldn't quite
put my finger on why...

1002

was shot and stabbed,

would have presented to us

as a heart attack,
like you assumed.

nature of his business,

1074
00:39:33,877 --> 00:39:37,248
and I cooperated in
an LAPD investigation

1075
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:39,250
that involved wiretapping.

1076
00:39:39,283 --> 00:39:42,018
My actions have been
reported to the state bar,

1077
00:39:42,052 --> 00:39:44,288
and I have been reprimanded.

1078
00:39:44,321 --> 00:39:46,457
Mr. Stone's reputation
has been tarnished,

1079
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,124
and for that, I am sorry.

1080
00:39:48,158 --> 00:39:51,428
I'm relieved that
justice has been served.

1081
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:54,064
Mr. Stone deserves
a second chance...

1082
00:39:55,966 --> 00:39:58,502
and the full faith
of the community.

1083
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:01,672

1084
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:04,841
Thank you. Thank you.

1085
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:08,679
I accept your
apology, Mr. Evers.

1086
00:40:08,712 --> 00:40:11,915
I will also accept an
undisclosed settlement

1087
00:40:11,948 --> 00:40:14,751
from the City of Los Angeles.

1088
00:40:14,785 --> 00:40:18,188
I'm glad to see our
elected officials working

1089
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:21,758
to right this egregious wrong.

1090
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:23,660
I hope you all have
learned your lesson

1091
00:40:23,694 --> 00:40:27,030
and will strive to do better.

1092
00:40:27,063 --> 00:40:28,532
Thank you.

1093
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:29,642

1094
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,302

1095
00:40:31,335 --> 00:40:38,542


1096
00:40:38,575 --> 00:40:39,786

1097
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:40,811
Smile.

1098
00:40:40,844 --> 00:40:42,446

1099
00:40:45,282 --> 00:40:48,752


1100
00:40:48,785 --> 00:40:49,920
What are you smiling about?

1101
00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:51,688
I did a thing.

1102
00:40:51,722 --> 00:40:54,190
What kind of thing?

1103
00:40:54,224 --> 00:40:55,335
Close your eyes.
I'll show you.

1104
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:57,461
Oh, no. 

1105
00:40:57,494 --> 00:40:58,795
Keep walking.

1106
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:00,764
You trust me,
right? 

1107
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:03,534
Walking, we're
walking, we're walking.

1108
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,469
And... open your eyes.

1109
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:07,538

1110
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:09,549
I know we said we'd go this weekend
together and get your stuff.

1111
00:41:09,573 --> 00:41:10,650
I thought I'd surprise you.

1112
00:41:10,674 --> 00:41:12,343
Oh, thank you.

1113
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:14,177
♪ If I could wish upon a star ♪

1114
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,179
Now let's put it
back in storage.

1115
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:18,815
Yeah. Whoa, what? I
got your big hug chair.

1116
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:20,817
I don't want that
thing hugging me.

1117
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:23,487
It's hideous. Oh, it's not...

1118
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,521
that hideous.

1119
00:41:24,555 --> 00:41:26,357
No, really, it is.

1120
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,091
Especially next to
all your furniture.

1121
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:29,993
You have such good taste.

1122
00:41:30,026 --> 00:41:32,162
Yeah, especially in fiancées.

1123
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:35,332
Aww. ♪ Over the
hills and far away ♪

1124
00:41:35,366 --> 00:41:37,501
Well, it can go back.

1125
00:41:37,534 --> 00:41:41,037
But this... has to stay.

1126
00:41:41,071 --> 00:41:42,806
 I made it.

1127
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:44,841
You don't say.

1128
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,109

1129
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:48,178
It spent an hour too
long in the kiln.

1130
00:41:48,211 --> 00:41:49,813
No, no, it's perfect.
This is excellent.

1131
00:41:49,846 --> 00:41:52,115
It'll live right here. Aww.

1132
00:41:52,148 --> 00:41:53,984
And he will bring us luck.

1133
00:41:54,017 --> 00:41:56,520
There. Now it's our home.

1134
00:41:56,553 --> 00:41:58,254

1135
00:41:58,288 --> 00:41:59,656

1136
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,258

1137
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:06,196
I'm sure that doesn't
mean anything.

1138
00:42:06,229 --> 00:42:07,864
Oh.

1139
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:11,501
But you never "gnome."
