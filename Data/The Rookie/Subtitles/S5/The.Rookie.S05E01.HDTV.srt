1
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:04,630
Previously on "The Rookie"...
Rosalind Dyer,
the most rare of unicorns --

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,923
a female serial killer.

3
00:00:05,923 --> 00:00:08,300
Congratulations.
I underestimated you.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,053
Rosalind, you are never
going to walk free.

5
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,639
Who are you supposed
to deliver the drugs to?
Roy Hajek.

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,390
Wisco will give you
your cash on the way out.

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,018
Or you could do
another job for me.

8
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,645
And we'll need a driver,
so bring your old lady.

9
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,146
Hello!

10
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,565
If we're gonna sell
that we are, you know,

11
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,733
actually boyfriend
and girlfriend,

12
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,276
then we might have to...

13
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,529
I just received
a formal request

14
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,365
to temporarily assign you
to another station.

15
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,200
That means I'll miss
my T. O. exam.

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,702
The station you're going to is
four hours away, on the border.

17
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,262
Good morning.

18
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:55,681
What a beautiful day
for a trial.

19
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,935
Oh.

20
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,520
And who are you?

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,398
Your shadow --
Deputy Suriel.

22
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,234
I'll be with you every second
you're outside of this prison.

23
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,569
Hmm.

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,362
Well, then, I hope
you're good company.

25
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,323
Oh, I'm great company --
if you're not my prisoner.

26
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,275
This is not a break-in.

27
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:49,943
I'm just coming home
from the run.

28
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,862
Surprise!
What?

29
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,280
Happy birthday!

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,991
Thank you.
But it is not my birthday.

31
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:59,036
I know. It's your half birthday,
which is just as important.

32
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,121
Oh, my God. Does that count
against my actual age?

33
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,290
No. In fact...

34
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,958
It was the only candle
they had at the store.

35
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,836
Thank you.
This is so great.

36
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,338
When did you even have time
to do this?

37
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,256
I was gone 30 minutes.
Yeah,
I was gonna mention,

38
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,424
you know,
you really should think about

39
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,800
doing some more cardio
at your age.

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,761
Cake says I'm 20.
The cake is a lie, John.

41
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:17,804
Oh, well,
it's very sweet.

42
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,931
And I'm sure not at all
an effort to cheer me up

43
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,100
because today is
Rosalind's trial.

44
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,645
Well, you know, you can ask
to be assigned somewhere else.

45
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,814
I know, but somehow
that just doesn't feel right.

46
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:28,982
Shall we have
some of this cake?

47
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,818
After I cheer you up
in the shower.

48
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:34,488
Oh, God,
it is my birthday.

49
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,552
Yeah?

50
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,138
Morning.
Uh, hi.

51
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,975
Um, are you on your way
to school?
In a few.

52
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,727
You should take
the long way around.

53
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,229
You know, they already
started blocking off

54
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,022
some of those streets
around the courthouse.

55
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,108
I know.
You told me.

56
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,777
I could blow off class
if you want.

57
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,904
We could go shopping
or see a movie.

58
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,239
I'm gonna be fine.

59
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,282
I'm not gonna be
anywhere near Rosalind.

60
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,034
Tim and I
are station-bound,

61
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,869
waiting for
the phone to ring.

62
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,204
On your undercover thing?

63
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,289
Yeah. The original
go-time fell through,

64
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,583
and it's just been
radio silence since then.

65
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,544
Is this the same undercover
thing you and Tim

66
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,629
were discussing
the other night?

67
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:39,094
I already told you
that kiss didn't mean anything.

68
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,595
Right, right.

69
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,013
It was for the case.

70
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,599
Make out. Stop crime.
That totally tracks.

71
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,435
Go to school.

72
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:47,519
Okay.

73
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,855
Well,
have a great day.

74
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,565
With your boss.

75
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,941
Who you kissed.

76
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,568
Get out!

77
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,611
And close the door!

78
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,909
You kissed Lucy?

79
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,578
No, no.

80
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:07,247
No, Dim kissed Juicy,
okay?

81
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,624
Or Jake kissed Sava.
Whatever.

82
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,750
The -- The point is,

83
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,210
we had to be comfortable
going undercover,

84
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,879
so we practiced
being a couple.

85
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,964
How much
did you practice?

86
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,718
It was just a kiss.
Not that big of a deal.

87
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,262
Then why are we
talking about it?

88
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:26,057
Because what if it wasn't
just a kiss for her?

89
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,060
You think Lucy
has feelings for you?

90
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,395
No.

91
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,272
Then she probably sees it
how you do.

92
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,358
Just a weird thing
you had to do for work.

93
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,444
Right.

94
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,780
Timothy.

95
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,573
Do you have feelings
for Lucy?

96
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,826
No.
No, I'm dating Ashley.

97
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,119
And Lucy is with Chris.

98
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:49,039
And I'm her superior officer,
so...

99
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,291
All true.
Not what I asked.

100
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,548
What's the Chief
doing here?

101
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:02,093
All right,
settle down and listen up.

102
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,929
We got a big day
ahead of us.

103
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:07,474
The Rosalind Dyer trial is going
to complicate all of our lives.

104
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,601
But before that,

105
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,311
Chief Coleman has
some good news.

106
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,064
Chief.
Thank you, Sergeant.
I'm sure you're all aware

107
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,566
of Officer Nolan's heroic stand
down at the border

108
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,027
which landed a dozen
dangerous felons in custody.

109
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,738
In light of your courageous
and exemplary service,

110
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:24,991
I've decided to offer you
any assignment in the LAPD.

111
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,495
Any unit, any division,
any position you want

112
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,206
the department to train you for
is yours.

113
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,542
It's what we unofficially call
the Golden Ticket.

114
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:34,543
Thank you, Ma'am.

115
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,797
It's a big decision.
Don't rush it.

116
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,132
I won't.

117
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,467
Sergeant.
Chief.

118
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,095
What'd I miss?
Nolan got
a Golden Ticket.

119
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,139
Wow.

120
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,475
Congratulations,
Officer Nolan.
Thank you, sir.

121
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,644
I once said
you'll never make detective.

122
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,188
I happily stand corrected.

123
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,024
Don't waste your ticket
by becoming a detective, Nolan.

124
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,068
You know how hard
they have to work?

125
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,361
Go with recruiting.

126
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,196
You get paid
to fly around the country

127
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,531
and talk up the LAPD.

128
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,616
Boring.
You go with air support.

129
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,909
The city will pay
for flight school,

130
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,536
and you'll always have
a backup career.

131
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,955
Do I need
a backup career?

132
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,540
K-9 is the way to go.

133
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,710
Overtime is $200 an hour,
and you get to keep the dog.

134
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,503
And if all you want is money,

135
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,589
the department will pay you
to learn computer forensics.

136
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,049
Or I could use the ticket
to get back on track

137
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,093
for becoming a training officer
this year.

138
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,347
That's funny.
Yeah.

139
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,850
Kidding.
No, I mean, uh -- no.

140
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,185
I, uh, certainly have
some thinking to do, yeah.

141
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,396
He's gonna pick
something lame.
Oh, for sure.

142
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,985
Sorry. Jake's phone.

143
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,945
It's Hajek.

144
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,282
All right.
Back to Rosalind Dyer.

145
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,118
Yo, I thought you were
never gonna call.

146
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,163
Had to iron out a few details,
but the job's back on track.

147
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,165
Is your lady squared away?
Hell, no.

148
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:56,458
You think we don't got
lives of our own,

149
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,043
waiting around
on some mystery gig?

150
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,545
Relax. The payday's
worth the suspense.

151
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,422
Wisco and Lyon
are taking point.

152
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,550
And we're adding your buddy
Dayvion Mosby for extra muscle.

153
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,888
Yo, Dayvion's money.

154
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,057
Dayvion's handsy.
Get someone else.

155
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:14,225
He's already hired.
Deal with it.

156
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,227
So what time
we meeting up?
Two hours.

157
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,771
I'll get back to you
with the details.

158
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,358
This Dayvion guy shows up,
it's over.

159
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,110
Then I need to make sure
he doesn't.

160
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,090
Hey.
Hey.

161
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,008
Kind of, uh, --
kind of a circus.

162
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,135
Seriously. Which makes it
that much harder for me

163
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,512
to wrap my head
around the fact

164
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,263
that you and Rosalind
have a relationship.

165
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,766
It's not like we were dating.
Uh, changing the subject --

166
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,643
Chief of Police
gave me a Golden Ticket.

167
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,561
As in Willy Wonka?

168
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,981
As in I can pick any job
I want in the department.

169
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,983
Wow.
What are you gonna pick?

170
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,569
Uh, am I crazy
for wanting to use it

171
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,488
to get back on track
to being a training officer?

172
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,073
Well, you know,
they give you a dog

173
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,700
if you join
the K-9 Unit?

174
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,411
Okay, if you want a dog,
we can just get a dog.

175
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,912
- All right, everybody, listen up.
- Can you gather around?

176
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:18,832
Have your attention
for a second, please.

177
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,543
Thank you very much.
I'm Sean Del Monte.

178
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,170
I'm prosecuting the case
against Rosalind Dyer.

179
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,797
This is Chris Sanford
from my office,

180
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,799
Sergeant Grey, LAPD.

181
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,385
This is Captain Duane Tovar
from the Sheriff's Department.

182
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,679
He's overseeing all security
at the courthouse.

183
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,973
It is my hope
that this trial will close

184
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,726
a very painful chapter
in this city's history

185
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:41,521
and bring some peace to the
families that she's destroyed.

186
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,773
With that, I'd like to turn it
over to Captain Tovar.

187
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,358
Duane?
Thank you.

188
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,694
This is a rendering
of the Superior Courthouse.

189
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,740
We have 840 daily employees,
7,000 daily visitors.

190
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,575
There are 50 courtrooms.

191
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,286
The Dyer trial will be on the
sixth floor of the West Wing.

192
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,581
The escort team will arrive at a
secret entrance to avoid crowds.

193
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:01,207
Sergeant Grey's team
will be there

194
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,168
to secure the sixth floor
and escort the prisoner

195
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,170
to and from the courtroom.

196
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,381
The package is in route.
E. T. A. 30 minutes.

197
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,469
We will have eyes on Rosalind
every second of the day.

198
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,807
Do you think I'm a monster,
Deputy Suriel?

199
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,145
I think it's not my job
to decide.

200
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,232
Do you think
you're a monster?

201
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,151
No.

202
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,403
I think I'm a genius.

203
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,073
I just had the misfortune
of excelling at mutilation

204
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,241
instead of music.

205
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,577
Okay.

206
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,705
That's him.
Hey, Dayvion.

207
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,166
What's up, Officers?

208
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,959
Just here for
a quick parole search.

209
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,170
Come on in.
I ain't got nothing to hide.

210
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,923
Actually,
let's start with your car.

211
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,633
That's not my car.

212
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,551
Oh, no?

213
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,803
Well, let's just check
to be sure.

214
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,056
That's not
a good start, man.

215
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,106
Oh.

216
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,774
And it just got worse.

217
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,818
I suppose this isn't
your gun, either?

218
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,320
All right.

219
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:19,285
Ugh. Why couldn't my
doppelganger be less greasy?

220
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,372
It's actually surprising
how easily you turn skeevy.

221
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,417
Oh.
Looking good, Juicy.

222
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:28,920
I am seriously second-guessing
this tactical decision

223
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,505
to wear a thong
for authenticity.

224
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,760
Yo. Are we doin' this
or what?

225
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,178
We are.
Meet my guys

226
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,430
at Whittier Air Strip.
30 minutes.

227
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,433
Air strip?
I thought this job was local.

228
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,103
It's not.
That a problem?

229
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,480
Uh, yeah,
that's a problem.

230
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,233
I travel with
three suitcases minimum.

231
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,485
It requires precision
to look this good.

232
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,655
Tough. I'm paying you to drive,
not to play dress up.

233
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,240
So get your ass
to the Air Strip

234
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,076
or look good in a coffin.

235
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,203
We got to call it off.
What's the problem?

236
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:05,039
Once we're in the air,
no backup, no surveillance.

237
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,749
Things go sideways,
we're completely on our own.

238
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,209
Plus, we'll have no idea
where they're going.

239
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,961
It's not worth the risk.
I'm pulling the plug.

240
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,173
Uh, wait. Hold on. The pilot
has to file a flight plan.

241
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,508
You could follow along
in the LAPD plane.

242
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,468
The paperwork to get that
authorized will take all day.

243
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,262
And you're wheels up
in an hour.

244
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,183
I mean, I can get a private jet
there in 45 minutes.

245
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,519
Also, what kind of caviar
do you guys like?

246
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,189
I'll just get
an assortment.

247
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,010
Hello, John.

248
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,845
Rosalind.

249
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,015
You look good.
Happy.

250
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,768
Would you say
that's job satisfaction?

251
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,228
Or Bailey?

252
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,522
I'd say
it's seeing justice served.

253
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,403
He's such a boy scout.

254
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,447
John Nolan.
Megan Suriel.

255
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,324
I assume you've been briefed
on our security arrangements.

256
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,867
I have.
Let's go.

257
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,330
You know,
I follow Bailey on Instagram.

258
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,166
Oh, I love that cake
she made this morning.

259
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,544
And Luna, too.
She is getting good on a horse.

260
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,213
Oh, and Lucy's
little friend Tamara --

261
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,548
she is doing so well
at SMC.

262
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,760
Am I supposed to applaud
that you can use social media?

263
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,136
Or are you hoping
I'll be unsettled

264
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,097
that you're name-dropping people
I care about?

265
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,723
I think it's the only
party trick she's got.

266
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,434
I was so disappointed
Lucy decided not to testify.

267
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,937
I was really looking forward
to seeing her again --

268
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,356
revisiting
our favorite song.

269
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:54,649
Will you please send her
my love?

270
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,567
No.

271
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,460
Yo. Nice ride.

272
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,795
You're late.

273
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,257
Yeah, well, our quickie
wasn't so quick.

274
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,011
Where's Dayvion?
Flaked.

275
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,096
That ain't like him.
That's exactly like him.

276
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,180
Hajek's pissed.

277
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,348
We had to scramble
to get a replacement.

278
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,433
That's Sway.

279
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,852
Hi, sexy.
I'm Sava.

280
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,270
What's up?
Jake.

281
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,522
We got a lot of gear.
It's a big job.

282
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:38,026
Mm-hmm. Are you gonna
finally tell us what it is?

283
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:40,653
When we're airborne.
First...

284
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,030
Cellphones.

285
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,406
Mm.

286
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:44,949
You'll get them back
when it's over.

287
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,701
Can't risk
operational security.

288
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,703
You hear that, baby?

289
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,329
We're in
the big leagues now --

290
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,999
using terms like
"operational security."

291
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,627
Get in the damn plane.

292
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:01,883
You heard the man.
Get in the damn plane.

293
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,640
They're boarding.
How's that jet coming?

294
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,851
It's almost here.

295
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,062
Hajek's crew just filed
their flight plan.

296
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,064
Where are they going?
Vegas.

297
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,076
Hey, Beth.
Wondered if I'd run into you.

298
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,537
Wesley. Did I hear you're
joining the D. A.'s office?
Next week.

299
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,873
I'm here defending my last case
before the transition.

300
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,000
I was shocked to hear

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,502
you're representing
Rosalind Dyer.

302
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,836
Thought corporate law
was your thing.

303
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,005
Corporate law
is my dad's thing.

304
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,673
I need to pave
my own way.

305
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,509
Well, representing
the most brutal serial killer

306
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:47,553
in L. A.'s history -- that'll
certainly put you on the map.

307
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,848
This is me.

308
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,683
I would wish you luck,
but, uh...

309
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,018
I hope your client
rots in hell.

310
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,229
Well, you're not alone.
Crap, I'm late.

311
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,397
Uh, take the stairs.
The elevators are a nightmare.

312
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,857
Thanks.

313
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,114
The package
is on the sixth floor.

314
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,573
We're shutting it down
now.

315
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,414
Whoa. This area is secure.
You need to go back downstairs.

316
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,917
I'm Beth Veston,
attorney for Rosalind Dyer.

317
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,293
You can see your client
in the courtroom.

318
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,379
My client has
a lawful right

319
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,214
to appear in civilian clothing
at trial.

320
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,968
She gets changed, or you get
sued and I get a mistrial.

321
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,011
So spunky.
Don't you just love her.

322
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,889
That room right there
is for counseling clients.

323
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,891
She can change there.
I will be present.

324
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,060
What about attorney/client
privacy?

325
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,563
I'll close my ears.
Peel off and secure each door.

326
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,314
No one else
comes in this hall.

327
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,983
See you soon, John.

328
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,361
Get in there.

329
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,956
Can't I sit?

330
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,041
You're gonna be
sitting all day.

331
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,836
Step back.

332
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,087
It's already
been searched.

333
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,755
She's just
doing her job.

334
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,761
All right.
Get her dressed.

335
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,513
Well, aren't you
going to uncuff me?

336
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,764
Not all the way.

337
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,183
Your attorney can help you
get dressed.

338
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:18,227
I'll uncuff you in stages,
starting at the bottom.

339
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,540
Did I do it?

340
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,875
Is she dead?

341
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,793
You did great.

342
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,212
Get her keys.

343
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,553
This is taking too long.

344
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,555
Nolan, there's been
a credible bomb threat.

345
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,057
We're evacuating
the courthouse.

346
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:57,683
So I need you
to secure Rosalind

347
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,727
and put her back
on the prison transport.

348
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,356
It's Rosalind.
She's trying to escape.

349
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,367
Rosalind is out of pocket.
She may be dressed as a deputy.

350
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,910
Repeat,
Rosalind has escaped.

351
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,870
We need to lock
this building down.

352
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,926
I have eyes on Dyer.
Red hair, Deputy uniform.

353
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,511
Repeat,
Rosalind Dyer is 45-32.

354
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,555
Stay calm. Keep moving.

355
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,516
Nolan.
What's going on?

356
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,685
Stop that deputy!

357
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,856
Give me your hands!

358
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,743
Your friends
are so grumpy.

359
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,288
Ain't no one here to have fun.
It's a job.

360
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,873
That's what everyone
keeps saying.

361
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,583
Except so far,
it's just been

362
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,544
the world's lamest
bachelor party.

363
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,380
Yo, y'all gonna tell us
what this gig is or what?

364
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,259
You know
who Roman Krupka is?

365
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:55,510
Nope.

366
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,512
He imports H
for the Monarch Cartel.

367
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:00,056
So, the competition.
Something like that.

368
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:02,851
Krupka's paranoid,
doesn't trust computers,

369
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,769
never keeps
a written record.

370
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,397
The details of his operation
exist in one place --

371
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,565
"The Brain."

372
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,525
A man
named Leonard Madris.

373
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,652
Ain't that
a little dangerous --

374
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,988
making one man the center
of your whole operation.

375
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,990
Yeah, it is.

376
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,741
That's why Madris is kept
under heavy guard.

377
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,578
Barely leaves
Krupka's compound.

378
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,954
But we received
a solid tip

379
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,081
that he's headed to Vegas
this weekend.

380
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,624
With his bodyguards?

381
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,917
Never goes
anywhere without them.

382
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,294
That's where
you come in.

383
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:32,589
You guys take out the guards
while I grab Madris.

384
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:36,467
And then we torture The Brain
for every detail.

385
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,803
And take over
the business.

386
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,638
Oh.

387
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,100
It sounds like we should be
getting paid more.
Mm-hmm.

388
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,144
Tough.
Like my mom used to say --

389
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,397
"You get what you get,
and you don't get upset."

390
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:55,195
Well, this seems a lot bigger
than we thought.

391
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,696
Yep.

392
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,786
So, what are you doing here?

393
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,205
I thought you were on
maternity leave.

394
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,625
I was until "Jacqueline
the Ripper" escaped.

395
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,251
What can I do?

396
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:12,503
Are you sure? You're like
eleventy months pregnant.

397
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,088
Okay,
let me amend that.

398
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,674
What can I do that does not
involve leaving the station?

399
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,676
Rosalind's lawyer's
in the box.

400
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,178
Says she'll only talk
to Nolan.

401
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,471
Why don't you do
the interview with him?

402
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:22,680
It's a full house.

403
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,349
Rosalind mentioned them
by name.

404
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:26,476
We got protection units
for everyone else.

405
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,019
Oh, I know.
I said hi to the one

406
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,687
outside my house
as I was leaving.

407
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,522
And by the way,
love the shoes.

408
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,400
Hey.

409
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,236
What's this I hear
about a Golden Ticket?

410
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,363
Well, that hardly seems
important right now.

411
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:41,074
All I am saying is
welcome to the club.
Thank you.

412
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,077
You look like you're ready
to give birth at any moment.

413
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,663
Do you want to sit?
I will never be able
to get back up.

414
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,581
You know, I could ask Bailey
to call the firehouse,

415
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,916
have them bring in
a gurney,

416
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,209
just so at least
you could lie down?

417
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,336
You had me at --
"do the job from bed."

418
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,546
I'll do it.
I saw Bailey in the break room.

419
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,799
Come on, Tamara.
Let's get some snacks.

420
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,177
We are going to be here
for a while.

421
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,887
Wesley knows
the lawyer.

422
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,138
Really?
A little.

423
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:05,723
We went to high school
together.

424
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,225
Our families move
in the same circles.

425
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,394
Meaning -- she's rich?
Beyond.

426
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:11,062
Any insight into why
she would do this?

427
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,397
Not really, no.

428
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,607
I mean, she was always
a little creepy.

429
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,902
Very bright,
but casually cruel.

430
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,237
I always chalked it up
to privilege.

431
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,863
Clearly,
Rosalind hired her

432
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,074
because she sensed Beth
would make a good acolyte.

433
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,701
Like Caleb.

434
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,952
Has she asked
for a lawyer?

435
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,079
No.
She's representing herself.

436
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,123
Let's go talk to her,
then.

437
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,922
Who are you?
Detective Harper.

438
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,258
And I am supposed to be
at home in bed right now,

439
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:43,261
so forgive me
if I skip the small talk.

440
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,431
You confessed
to killing Deputy Suriel.

441
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,016
Why'd you do that?

442
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,768
Rosalind talked about you
all the time.

443
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:52,770
The boy scout.

444
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,065
Honestly, it made me
a little jealous.

445
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,151
Look,
you clearly need help.

446
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,777
Tell us
where Rosalind is.

447
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,070
We'll push for you
to get sentenced

448
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,239
to a psychiatric
hospital.

449
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,616
I'm not crazy.

450
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,827
I'm special.

451
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,330
Rosalind showed me that.

452
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,583
What are you doing?

453
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,590
I'm supposed to
tell you something.

454
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,596
People are gonna die.

455
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:29,891
People are gonna die,
and you can't save them.

456
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,069
Can I help you?

457
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,737
Yes.

458
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,116
Your daughter sent me.

459
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,671
Help me!

460
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,106
Look at this.
No way.

461
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:21,151
What?
Rosalind Dyer
just escaped.

462
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,570
I'm glad we're not
in L. A. tonight.

463
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,072
That chick gives me
nightmares.

464
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,824
Yeah, but it'd be
the perfect night to run wild,

465
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:30,744
'cause the cops will totally be
distracted looking for her.

466
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,956
How long till we land?

467
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,416
15 minutes.

468
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:38,627
Plenty of time.
For what?

469
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,462
Mile high club, baby.

470
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:44,341
I never thought
you'd ask.

471
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:50,055
How could this happen?
I don't know.

472
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:52,015
But every law enforcement agency
in Southern California

473
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,058
is on it, okay?

474
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:54,100
She won't be out long.

475
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,393
D-Did --
Uh, did she have help?

476
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:56,978
Another apprentice.
Like Caleb?

477
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,439
I mean --
Stop, okay?

478
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,857
Stop.

479
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,025
We can't worry
about that right now.

480
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,611
If your head is not 100%
in the game,

481
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:06,780
it'll get you killed.

482
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,532
You're right. I-I know.
I just -- It's -- I'm fine.

483
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,993
I-I can do this.
No.

484
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:13,328
No, you're not.

485
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,663
I'm pulling the plug
as soon as we land.

486
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,790
Uh...

487
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,291
No.

488
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,752
Look, the stakes
are too high.

489
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:23,338
This is our one chance
at Madris.

490
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:26,007
The news threw me for a second,
but I'm...

491
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,342
I'm fine.

492
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,929
I can do this.

493
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:33,932
Yo, finish up.
We're landing.

494
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:41,314
Okay.

495
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,859
Lucy, if you change your mind,
you just say the word.

496
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,403
I will.
Okay?

497
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:47,654
Mm-hmm.
Let's go.

498
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,030
Wait.
What?

499
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,199
We're supposed to be
hooking up in here.

500
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,035
What?

501
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:05,505
Okay.
Um...that's good.

502
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,048
Yeah.
Let's do this.

503
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,406
Room keys.

504
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:14,741
Wisco and I are on
either side of you.

505
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,076
Sway's across the hall.

506
00:26:16,076 --> 00:26:18,411
We have some time,
so rest up.

507
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,997
Who sleeps in Vegas?
We're hitting the clubs.

508
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:24,042
No. You're staying close,
and you're staying sharp.

509
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,586
Jake!
We're on the move
at first light.

510
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,463
Jake!

511
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,591
Hey, girl.

512
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:32,926
Oh,
don't "hey, girl" me.

513
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,219
You weren't even
gonna look at me?

514
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,596
Didn't I tell you
the next time I saw you

515
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,973
I'd light that greasy hair
of yours on fire?

516
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:43,144
You lost a lot of weight,
huh?

517
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:46,314
Oh, hey. Hello?
Back off.

518
00:26:46,314 --> 00:26:49,067
You must be the new skank.

519
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,194
Who are you calling
a skank?
Aah!

520
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:52,821
You better get
the hell out of here.

521
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,322
If I see you again,
I'm gonna rip

522
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,157
this janky-ass hairpiece
out of your head.

523
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:57,283
Hmm?

524
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:59,077
That's enough.

525
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:02,080
What? You want me
to let her go?

526
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,207
Please.

527
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:10,046
Psycho.

528
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:13,091
She's cute.

529
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,093
You two need to keep
a low profile.

530
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,594
The last thing we want
is for you to get arrested

531
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,179
over some B. S.
with an ex.

532
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,098
Yo, we'll be on
our best behavior.

533
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,641
Scout's honor.
Mm, screw that.

534
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,102
We are going to hit
the casino

535
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:26,688
and see if we can get lucky
three times in one day.

536
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,147
Hm?

537
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:37,532
Mind if we sit in?

538
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,742
It's a free country.

539
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,211
Target's Leonard Madris.

540
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:53,381
Madris knows where everything
in Roman Krupka's operation

541
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,466
is buried --
and everyone.

542
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,468
Where is he? I'll have
Vegas P. D. pick him up.

543
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,053
They haven't told us.

544
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:00,638
We make our move first thing
in the morning.

545
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:01,973
We won't know anything
until we're en route.

546
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:03,224
What happened
with Rosalind?

547
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,684
She hired
a psychopath lawyer

548
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,436
who helped her kill a deputy
and escape.

549
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:10,523
I knew it.

550
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,317
Another Caleb.

551
00:28:14,027 --> 00:28:16,154
You need to protect
Tamara.
Already on it.

552
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,822
She's at the station,

553
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,908
and we have protection details
on everyone we think

554
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:22,035
Rosalind might even think
about going after.

555
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:28,041
Are you sure
you're up for this?

556
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,752
If you need to pull
the rip cord, I understand.

557
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:33,421
She's solid.

558
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:36,007
Okay.
I'll contact Vegas P. D.,

559
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,843
and with any luck, they'll get
a location on Madris tonight

560
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:41,179
so we can snatch up your crew
before bullets start flying.

561
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:43,181
What happens if we don't
catch him in time?

562
00:28:43,181 --> 00:28:44,515
We have to be creative.

563
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,351
Remember,
our priority is saving lives,

564
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:48,019
even if that means
we lose Madris.

565
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,649
Let's go.

566
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:54,108
That's it for me.

567
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:58,613
You won all that
just now?

568
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:00,490
Yeah.

569
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:04,243
Can you help me?
If you let me keep some.

570
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,203
Eh...

571
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,582
I got something.

572
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,376
I found an article
Beth published

573
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,211
in her school's
law review.

574
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,755
And she argues that criminality
is a construct that changes

575
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:18,591
based on the prevailing
social mores of the culture.

576
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:19,884
Sounds pretentious.

577
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,095
I don't entirely
disagree.

578
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:24,639
Mm. Towards the end,
she defends cannibalism.

579
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,392
Ooh. Okay.
Well, she lost me there.

580
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:30,395
Morally flexible.
Just Rosalind's type.

581
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:33,606
I get what Rosalind saw in Beth
and what she needed from her,

582
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:35,775
but what does Beth
get out of this?

583
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,610
Love?

584
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,529
She's infatuated
with Rosalind?

585
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:42,281
Maybe.
I think you're gonna want
to see this.

586
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,325
They've been scrubbing security
footage from the courthouse.

587
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,786
This BMW was parked
by the south exit.

588
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,454
It's registered
to Nicole Veston.

589
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,956
Beth's mom?

590
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,458
Okay, so she borrowed
the car for the day?

591
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,419
No. Beth's car is still parked
at the courthouse.

592
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,046
So she left it there
for Rosalind.

593
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,589
Probably had
a change of clothes

594
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,133
and a burner phone
ready to go.

595
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:02,010
We don't think
the mom is in on it, do we?

596
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,971
No, no.
Beth hates her parents.

597
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,639
It's more likely
she used their car to hurt them.

598
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:09,267
Anybody I ever knew
who hated their parents

599
00:30:09,267 --> 00:30:11,602
were also scared
of them.

600
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:14,188
That is what she's getting
out of this relationship.

601
00:30:14,188 --> 00:30:16,691
Rosalind's gonna kill her
parents for her.

602
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,487
Go, go, go!

603
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,031
Secure the perimeter.

604
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:45,303
Bodies!

605
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,143
She cleaned out the safe.

606
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:55,813
Sir.

607
00:30:58,024 --> 00:31:01,069
Hello, John.

608
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:05,323
Oh, it really was nice
to see you happy this morning.

609
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:08,993
And I thought maybe you'd like
to see me happy, too.

610
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:15,083
Ah.

611
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:17,502
Really is
like riding a bike.

612
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,509
Authorities urge caution
and calm tonight

613
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:28,679
as the city reels from the news
that Rosalind Dyer has escaped.

614
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:32,517
They don't know anything
we don't.

615
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:36,896
Yeah.

616
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:38,815
Yeah.

617
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:42,151
Ugh,
my head is killing me.

618
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:47,490
You're really good at this,
you know?

619
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,910
The whole
undercover thing.

620
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:56,082
Thank you.

621
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,963
Uh, do you mind if I take
the first shower?

622
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,965
No, it's fine.

623
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,056
Hey, you hungry?

624
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:15,518
Yes. I would get some
French fries if you're ordering.

625
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,605
Yeah. O-Okay.

626
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:22,483
Um...fries.

627
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:37,290
All even here
in the late-going 89th minute.

628
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,292
2-2.

629
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,630
The water pressure
is epic.

630
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,091
And I'm totally taking
one of these robes.

631
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,676
Wait.
That's not stealing, right?

632
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:49,761
No, no. They'll just
charge it to Hajek.

633
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,596
Then we should take two.

634
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:56,976
What?

635
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,478
Do you want
to talk about it?

636
00:32:58,478 --> 00:32:59,771
About what?

637
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:03,400
The airplane bathroom.
Your apartment.

638
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,151
Look, I-I don't know.

639
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:08,446
Call me crazy, but it just
doesn't feel like pretend.

640
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,410
Uh...

641
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,870
It's an intimate act.

642
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,874
I mean,
we'd have to be dead inside

643
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:21,918
for it to not trigger
something, right?

644
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:24,546
It -- It's basic biology.

645
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:28,341
Okay, so...

646
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:30,176
So you're saying
it's not a big deal?

647
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,803
Doesn't mean anything?

648
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,805
Right? I...

649
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:43,231
Yo.
It's me.
Can you talk?

650
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,191
Yeah. I'm just alone with Lucy
in the hotel room.

651
00:33:45,191 --> 00:33:47,152
Uh-oh.
What do you got?

652
00:33:47,152 --> 00:33:49,529
Las Vegas P. D. got a location
on Madris.

653
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:53,199
We're mobilizing with LVPD --
unless you think you need us.

654
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,577
No. We should be good
until morning.
When we get Madris,

655
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,245
we're coming back
to grab Hajek's crew.

656
00:33:57,245 --> 00:33:58,747
All right.
We'll be ready. Good luck.

657
00:33:58,747 --> 00:34:00,957
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

658
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:02,584
They get a line
on Madris?
Yeah.

659
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:04,711
Good. Okay. Uh,
I'm gonna blow-dry my hair.

660
00:34:04,711 --> 00:34:08,006
Otherwise, it'll be crazy
in the morning.

661
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:14,179
Hey, Jake.

662
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,809
Hey, Jake.
I know you're in there.

663
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:36,743
Hey, buddy.
This girl says you're not Jake.

664
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,912
Go get her.

665
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,428
Don't kill her yet.

666
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:56,763
No, you got this
all wrong.

667
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,223
Chick hasn't seen me
in forever.

668
00:34:58,223 --> 00:34:59,808
I lost weight.
So what?

669
00:34:59,808 --> 00:35:01,643
She said you guys hooked up
three weeks ago,

670
00:35:01,643 --> 00:35:03,103
you had quite the gut.

671
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,614
Are you okay?
I'll live.

672
00:35:14,614 --> 00:35:16,491
Hands behind your back!
Do it now!

673
00:35:17,951 --> 00:35:19,035
Hands behind your back.

674
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:25,166
Oh, gosh. Remind me
not to take a guy out

675
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,417
while I'm wearing
a robe.

676
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,253
I showed him
the entire world just now.

677
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:35,093
Rosalind's only been out
for 12 hours

678
00:35:35,093 --> 00:35:38,096
and three people
are dead.

679
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:41,057
This isn't your fault.

680
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:45,145
Well, I was the one
that pushed

681
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:46,980
to try her
for Caleb's crimes.

682
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,399
She was already gonna spend
the rest of her life in prison.

683
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:52,235
No. Y-You wanted to give
Caleb's victims closure.

684
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:55,989
Yeah. But I also wanted
the glory of trying that case.

685
00:35:57,991 --> 00:36:00,160
Now I got to live
with that.

686
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:04,831
Ah. Go home.

687
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:06,624
Get some sleep.

688
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,459
There's a police escort
waiting for you downstairs.

689
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:12,046
What are you gonna do?

690
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,756
I'm gonna finish
this bottle.

691
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,428
Good night. Go easy.
Yeah.

692
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:19,888
See you.
See you tomorrow.

693
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:22,348
Hey, Chris.

694
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:24,434
Yeah?

695
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:28,104
When you see Lucy
tonight...

696
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:30,190
tell her I'm sorry.

697
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,401
Yeah. I will.

698
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,034
Hey, it's me.

699
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:42,994
I-I know you're not
checking your messages.

700
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:44,829
You probably don't even have
your phone with you.

701
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:48,333
But, uh, I wanted to call
and say I'm thinking about you,

702
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,793
and, uh, I can't wait
until you're home.

703
00:36:50,793 --> 00:36:54,255
Please, just, uh, call me
the second you hear this.

704
00:36:57,425 --> 00:36:59,344
Hey.

705
00:37:23,076 --> 00:37:25,454
Wake up,
sleeping beauty.

706
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:27,372
Did we catch her?
No.

707
00:37:27,372 --> 00:37:29,750
But I am here
to take you home regardless.

708
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:31,585
Mm. Mm-hmm.

709
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:34,838
Not a great start
to maternity leave.

710
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:37,924
Well, taking it easy
is not your strong suit.

711
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:40,051
No,
but I have other gifts.

712
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:42,053
So many other gifts.

713
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:43,680
Here's your first lesson
in self-care --

714
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,850
You ready?
Step one -- leave the station.

715
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:48,477
Mm.

716
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:51,480
Is step two eat ice cream
for breakfast?

717
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,107
How'd you guess?

718
00:37:54,107 --> 00:37:55,317
Bye, guys.

719
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,864
Agent Garza just called.

720
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:03,283
A Porsche registered
to the Veston family

721
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:05,160
crossed the border
three hours ago.

722
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,953
So Rosalind is gone?

723
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:09,247
It's safe for us all
to go home?
That's right.

724
00:38:09,247 --> 00:38:10,791
Sweet.

725
00:38:10,791 --> 00:38:11,958
Lucy just texted.

726
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:14,419
She's headed back
to the apartment.

727
00:38:14,419 --> 00:38:16,296
Well, it's been real.

728
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,924
I wouldn't want to hide from a
crazed killer with anyone else.

729
00:38:18,924 --> 00:38:21,176
Let's go find my wife.
We'll give you a ride home.

730
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:25,222
So how long do you think
Rosalind will lay low?

731
00:38:25,222 --> 00:38:26,640
If she's smart, forever.

732
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,308
She sticks her head up
even for a second,

733
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:29,518
the feds will find her.

734
00:38:29,518 --> 00:38:32,103
She won't stop killing.
She can't.

735
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:33,480
As long
as she keeps quiet,

736
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,816
takes people
that won't be missed,

737
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:37,984
she could fly under the radar
for a very long time.

738
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:39,653
She's not that modest.

739
00:38:39,653 --> 00:38:42,656
Getting caught was the best
thing that ever happened to her.

740
00:38:42,656 --> 00:38:46,409
She wants us to know
exactly what she's capable of.

741
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:50,413
On that terrifying note
let's go home.

742
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:51,665
All right.

743
00:38:51,665 --> 00:38:53,667
Good work today.
Not good enough.

744
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:56,837
Hey, some days
are like that.

745
00:38:56,837 --> 00:38:59,130
I'm sure this is the furthest
thing from your mind,

746
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,549
but have you decided

747
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:02,634
what you're gonna do
with your Golden Ticket?

748
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:05,470
Yes, I have.

749
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,180
Woof woof?
Very funny, but no.

750
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,431
Detective?

751
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:10,308
Also no.

752
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:13,019
Training officer.

753
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:18,900
I knew it,
and I admire it.

754
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,236
Of course, everyone else is
gonna give you endless grief --

755
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:22,571
Of course.

756
00:39:22,571 --> 00:39:24,698
But I know you're doing it
to give back.

757
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:26,741
And that's noble
as hell.

758
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:28,076
If I want to be part
of the change,

759
00:39:28,076 --> 00:39:29,703
I need to put my money
where my mouth is.

760
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,121
Literally.

761
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,998
Do you know how much
forensic techs can make?

762
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:35,876
Yes. I --

763
00:39:35,876 --> 00:39:38,295
I'll schedule your T. O. exam
as soon as possible.

764
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:40,589
Well, maybe give me
a couple days to study up.

765
00:39:40,589 --> 00:39:42,966
I've been
a little busy.

766
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:44,509
Will do.
Right.

767
00:39:46,928 --> 00:39:49,347
I cannot wait to get out
of these clothes.

768
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:52,142
Yeah. I'm not gonna miss
that hairdo.

769
00:39:53,268 --> 00:39:55,395
I kinda like yours.

770
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:59,482
Thank you
for walking me up.

771
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:02,819
Yeah. No problem.

772
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:05,196
I guess this is it.

773
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:08,450
Tomorrow, we are back
to being us.

774
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,826
Right.

775
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:11,828
And everything
that happened undercover

776
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:14,706
we will just
leave behind.

777
00:40:14,706 --> 00:40:16,291
Right.

778
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:19,461
Yeah. What happens undercover
stays undercover.

779
00:40:22,464 --> 00:40:24,799
You know, in a sense,

780
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:27,385
since we haven't been debriefed,
we're still undercover.

781
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,056
I-I guess you're right.

782
00:40:31,056 --> 00:40:32,390
Mm-hmm.

783
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,608
Do you want to come in?

784
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:49,282
I-I -- I shouldn't.

785
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:20,397
I'm good.

786
00:41:23,316 --> 00:41:25,110
Oh. Chris.

787
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:27,028
I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

788
00:41:27,028 --> 00:41:30,115
Tim and I were ju--
No.

789
00:41:30,115 --> 00:41:32,701
Wait.
He still has a pulse.

790
00:41:32,701 --> 00:41:35,078
Yeah, this is
Sergeant Tim Bradford.

791
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:39,332
I need an ambulance at 2733
Elmhurst Drive, Apartment 610.

792
00:41:39,332 --> 00:41:41,292
Tim.

793
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:44,421
One sec.

794
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:45,463
Hello?

795
00:41:48,466 --> 00:41:49,718
Hello?

796
00:41:49,718 --> 00:41:51,136
Hello, John.

797
00:41:53,304 --> 00:41:55,306
Rosalind?

798
00:41:55,306 --> 00:41:58,810
I have to be quick.
We're refueling.

799
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:02,022
But I just wanted to make sure
someone checked on Lucy.

800
00:42:02,022 --> 00:42:03,648
What have you done?

801
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:55,281
You nervous?

802
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,449
Yeah, a little.

803
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,618
I was a guidance
counselor for 20 years.

804
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:02,705
But now I finally get to fulfill
my dream of being in the FBI.

805
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:07,126
You set the bar pretty high
when you were here last time.

806
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,087
The Bureau needs to keep
things low-key, and we

807
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,255
both know that's not you.

808
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,425
You're saying I just need
to prove myself worthy again.

809
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,178
No, no, no, Simone,
that's not the takeaway.

810
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,014
Coming for
the throne, coming for it.

811
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,850
Feeling that I'm
about to get it--

812
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,019
Three suspects
on street bikes.

813
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,104
Hey, handsome.

814
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:28,940
What's going on
with your hand?

815
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,066
You OK?
- I got his DNA!

816
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,651
Pretty good, right?

817
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:36,114
Co-co-coming
for the throne.

818
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:36,948
Look out!

819
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,409
I'm here to teach you.

820
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,828
I'm good with that, as long
as you're good with learning

821
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,496
from me, too.

822
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,123
Woo!

823
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,250
We got this!

824
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,626
We're Feds.

825
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:53,172
I'm coming for
it, coming for the throne.
