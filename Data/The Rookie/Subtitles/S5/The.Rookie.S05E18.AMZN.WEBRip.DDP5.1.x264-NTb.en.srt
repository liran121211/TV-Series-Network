180
00:06:10,922 --> 00:06:13,962
Handymen, chefs, nannies.

181
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:15,337
When you say
"celebrities"...

182
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:16,958
Lance Bass.

183
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,790
I hired those two
to take care of my house.

184
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,690
Woman:
Is that Lance Bass?

185
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:21,037
Well, Jake first.

186
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,383
Hey, guys!

187
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,900
Uh, but then
my sensualist quit,

188
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,039
and, uh,
Jake recommended Sava.

189
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,909
Interviewer: I'm sorry.
What's a sensualist?

190
00:06:29,043 --> 00:06:31,563
They optimize the pleasurability
of your surroundings.

191
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:34,641
Every element, from the tactile
to the olfactory.

192
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:36,643
I have an incredibly
stressful job,

193
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:40,635
so I want every aspect
of my home experience to be...

194
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,639
euphoric.

195
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:44,961
Oh.
[Inhales sharply]

196
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:46,894
More colorful.

197
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:48,787
An alien would never dance
like that.

198
00:06:48,925 --> 00:06:50,815
Mm, uh...

199
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,070
The mac and cheese.

200
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:54,065
Sorry about that.

201
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,586
No problem.

202
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:56,995
So what happened
after you hired them?

203
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,900
I fired them.
Why?

204
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,109
During the three days
they worked for me,

205
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:03,658
they had sex on every surface
of my house.

206
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:05,182
By "every," you mean...

207
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:08,011
Every even vaguely
flat surface...

208
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:13,021
floors, beds, couches, dressers,
counters, the diving board.

209
00:07:13,156 --> 00:07:14,916
Even inside the dog crate.

210
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:17,125
It was only
after Dim and Juicy were gone

211
00:07:17,264 --> 00:07:19,134
that he discovered
they'd also stolen

212
00:07:19,266 --> 00:07:22,366
several expensive watches
and some jewelry.

213
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:24,131
Interviewer:
- Were they arrested?
- No.

214
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:26,201
By the time police
questioned them,

215
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:28,172
the stolen property
was gone.

216
00:07:28,309 --> 00:07:30,039
Likely pawned,
so there wasn't

217
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:31,873
enough evidence
to press charges.

218
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:34,633
What we didn't know
at that point was

219
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:38,254
that Dim and Juicy were already
casing out their next target.

220
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:40,048
Mm.
The Baudelaires.

221
00:07:40,183 --> 00:07:41,633
Oh, baby,
this place is perfect.

222
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:43,121
Oh. No.
It's on us.

223
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,355
Ooh. Right there.
That's our in.

224
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,569
[Grunts]
Listen to me.

225
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,538
You go back to that house,
I'll shoot you in the face!

226
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:50,816
You got it?

227
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,055
Sent the guy packing.
Took his job.

228
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,480
Well, they caught a break

229
00:07:58,616 --> 00:08:00,236
when Jake showed up
to work on day one

230
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:02,066
and discovered
that the Baudelaire family

231
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:03,715
had recently lost their nanny.

232
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:05,902
So Juicy
slid right in.

233
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,903
What?

234
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,351
That's just a really descriptive
way to put that. [Chuckles]

235
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,393
Interviewer:
How long did they work there
before Dim went missing?

236
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,149
Three weeks.

237
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,739
And what can you tell me
about the Baudelaires?

238
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:21,498
They were made of money.

239
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,739
And... And then he just disappeared.

240
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:25,021
I-I don't know
what happened to him.

241
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,229
Karen, why is there
a police car outside?

242
00:08:27,368 --> 00:08:28,648
Karen?

243
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,754
I'm sorry,
Mr. Baudelaire, but, um,

244
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:32,509
Skip is missing.

245
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,310
Uh, sorry. And by Skip, you m...
you mean Jake?

246
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:38,692
Yes. Yes.

247
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,488
Uh, Skip and I, you know,
we got pet names for each other.

248
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:41,763
He calls me Sava.
I call him Jake.

249
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,040
It's not...

250
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:44,587
That's not even...
Okay.

251
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:47,011
So ha... hang on a second.
I just need...

252
00:08:47,147 --> 00:08:48,077
First of all,
your name is?

253
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:49,357
Charles Baudelaire.

254
00:08:49,494 --> 00:08:51,224
- And this is your house?
- Yes.

255
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:53,388
[Laughs]
I know, right?

256
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,293
Oh, Meredith, you have to try
this cleanse.

257
00:08:55,431 --> 00:08:57,021
Like, I have dropped
an entire size.

258
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:58,777
Yeah, and I have to get all
my clothes tailored now, but...

259
00:08:58,917 --> 00:09:00,707
Oh, my God.
The cops are here.

260
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,130
[Gasps]
Look at this.

261
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:04,365
Charles:
And this is my wife, Camille.

262
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:06,059
Karen says
that Skip is missing.

263
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,550
[Gasps] How awful.

264
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:09,305
Oh, God.
Did you hear that?

265
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:11,785
Apparently, now our handyman
is missing.

266
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,040
Okay.
I need to unpack all of this.

267
00:09:15,175 --> 00:09:17,245
I think the fastest way
to do it would be

268
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:19,974
to get a statement
from you first.

269
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:21,321
Officer Juarez,
will you please

270
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:22,727
take the Baudelaires
into the living room?

271
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:24,982
Sure.
Sir, ma'am, do you mind?

272
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:26,316
I'm super confused,
but okay.

273
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:27,742
Camille: Hey, Meredith,
I have to go.

274
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:28,977
But, girl, you have to try
this cleanse.

275
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,600
I'm serious.

276
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:32,332
This is why it took so long
to call you guys.

277
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:33,568
Nolan: Because you're doing
something illegal.

278
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:35,751
No. No.

279
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:37,225
Jake and I,
we have gone straight.

280
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,059
I am working here
as a nanny.

281
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
And he is a handyman.

282
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:44,173
Like I said, a lot to unpack.
Let's stay on track.

283
00:09:44,307 --> 00:09:45,717
You said Jake
disappeared?

284
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:46,721
Mm-hmm.

285
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:49,832
Babe.
Hey!

286
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:52,138
Hey, what... what time...
what time they back?

287
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:53,731
Like 3:00.

288
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:55,109
3:00. Alright.

289
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,109
Remind me to clear that
security footage, alright?

290
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,670
We don't want
another mishap

291
00:09:57,804 --> 00:09:59,084
like that last
Halloween situation.

292
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:00,739
Yeah.
That's true.

293
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,286
Oh!

294
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:03,949
I'mma get me
another beer.

295
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:05,256
You want anything?

296
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:07,187
Yeah.

297
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,850
Can you see if they got
that lobster salad?

298
00:10:09,988 --> 00:10:11,018
Lobster salad. Yeah.

299
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:12,032
Yeah, I'll get you
lobster salad.

300
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:14,173
Lobster salad!
All day.

301
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:15,243
Lobster salad life.

302
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:16,443
Ooh!
You love it?

303
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:19,201
Lobster sa...

304
00:10:19,342 --> 00:10:21,762
Okay, so Dim walked
into the hallway at 2:03 p.m.

305
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:23,857
But there are no cameras
- in that hallway.
- Right.

306
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:25,872
So he walked out of this shot
at 2:03.

307
00:10:26,004 --> 00:10:27,214
[Beeps]

308
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,560
And never emerged
from the hallway.

309
00:10:29,698 --> 00:10:31,288
We have hours more footage
of those two rooms,

310
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,393
but Dim never reappears.[Beeping]

311
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:35,219
Interviewer: That's unusual,
to say the least.

312
00:10:35,358 --> 00:10:36,878
Do you have a theory
on what happened?

313
00:10:37,015 --> 00:10:38,875
No, but Juicy
sure did.

314
00:10:39,017 --> 00:10:40,637
Okay.

315
00:10:40,778 --> 00:10:42,468
Alien abduction.

316
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:44,637
Oh, yeah.
Later, she added, uh,

317
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:46,582
"portal
to another dimension."

318
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:49,715
But she didn't appreciate
your suggestion.

319
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,236
Spontaneous combustion.

320
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,344
Interviewer: Oh. Like
the drummers in Spinal Tap.

321
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,140
Thank you for getting
the reference.

322
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:57,415
So we opened up
an investigation.

323
00:10:57,553 --> 00:10:59,313
Most likely the explanation
is just that

324
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,321
there was a glitch
in the security system.

325
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,563
Interviewer: Right.
But why wouldn't he tell Juicy

326
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,146
where he was going?

327
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:06,084

00:11:11,774 --> 00:11:13,434
Mm.

clearly didn't have.

332
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:18,676
Do Tim and I keep secrets
from each other?

00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:21,266
I mean... nothing big.

she kept.

Despite everything,
it really did seem

like Dim and Juicy
loved each other.

340

I just found a body,
and it's Sergeant Tim Bradford.

356
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,090
What?

357
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:25,676
Give me that.

358
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:28,544
No, it's not.
I'm at the station.

359
00:12:28,678 --> 00:12:30,508
I-It was Dim, obviously.

360
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:33,196
But, you know, in the moment,
I-I-I thought it was Tim.

361
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:35,058
And, um...

362
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:36,832
you know, anybody could have
made that mistake.

363
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:39,283
He's not wrong.
They looked so much alike.

364
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:42,733
My mind broke a little
when I saw Dim's body.

365
00:12:42,865 --> 00:12:44,105
Interviewer:
Why were you there?

366
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:46,006
We responded to Aaron's call
for an ambulance,

367
00:12:46,144 --> 00:12:47,844
but there was nothing
we could do.

368
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,984
Dim was... way dead. Yeah.

369
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:52,704
Rigor mortis had come and gone,
blowfly eggs had been laid,

370
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:54,121
but hair slippage
hadn't started yet,

371
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:56,186
which placed
the time of death

372
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:58,947
approximately 30 hours
before Aaron found the body.

373
00:12:59,088 --> 00:13:02,538
So around 6:00 p.m.
the day of Jake's disappearance.

374
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:04,678
Interviewer: Did it bother you,
seeing his body?

375
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,298
What do you mean?

376
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,200
To see a version of yourself
dead in a dumpster,

377
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:09,309
no matter how much
you protest

378
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:11,143
that you don't see
the resemblance,

379
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:13,243
I mean, it had to be
a little disconcerting.

380
00:13:14,483 --> 00:13:16,353
Yeah, a little, I guess.

381
00:13:16,485 --> 00:13:18,375

382
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,041
Interviewer:
Do you think Tim does?

383
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:22,078
No.

384
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:24,385
You know, he's been doing the
job a lot longer than I have,

385
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:26,697
so his walls are pretty high.

386
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,640
But, you know,
they have to be.

387
00:13:28,773 --> 00:13:31,163
Otherwise, the constant violence
would just consume you.

392
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:43,512
Empathy can be painful,
but the alternative,

393
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,720
at least for me,
is unthinkable.

00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:49,656
You know, I have to feel
for them.

396
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:52,214
Do the walls make it hard to be
in a relationship with Tim?

397
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:53,588
No.

398
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:57,489
But that's because I know,
behind those walls,

399
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,149
he's just a big softy.

400
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,737
Do I look like a big softy?

401
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,186
No, sir.

402
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:06,496
So, Officer Thorsen
found the body.

403
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,088
Dim disappeared from the mansion
at 2:03 p.m.

404
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:10,497
and was killed
four hours later.

405
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,612
So we had new mysteries
to solve.

406
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:14,338
How did Dim get out
of the house?

407
00:14:14,474 --> 00:14:17,274
Where was he for those
missing four hours?

408
00:14:17,408 --> 00:14:19,788
And how did he end up shot dead
in a dumpster?

409
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:22,278
Unfortunately, there were
no security cameras

410
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:23,483
around the alley,

411
00:14:23,621 --> 00:14:25,621
so they had no idea
who dumped the body.

412
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:28,281
It was at this point
that Detective Lopez and I
