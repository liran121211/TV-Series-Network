1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,337
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

2
00:00:02,373 --> 00:00:04,296
<i>Hey, Counselor. Harrison Novak.</i>

3
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:06,547
They're all wrapped the
same. They must be yours.

4
00:00:06,583 --> 00:00:07,672
These aren't mine.

5
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:09,644
- Thanks for coming right over.
- Yeah, of course.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,826
It seems clear that we have

7
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:12,976
<i>a second serial killer at large.</i>

8
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:15,775
- And you are?
- Her husband.

9
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,694
Oscar and Jason just
escaped from prison.

10
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,625
Who's out there?

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,180
- Show me your hands.
- Oh, my God. Don't shoot me.

12
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:23,810
I got a call from Detroit PD.

13
00:00:23,846 --> 00:00:25,853
They pulled prints from
a liquor store robbery

14
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:27,522
last night... Jason Wyler's.

15
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:28,606
Who are you?

16
00:00:28,642 --> 00:00:30,585
I'm the man hunting your ex-husband.

17
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:31,908
- Ahh!
- Malvado.

18
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:34,618
If you hear of Jason's
whereabouts, let me know.

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,000
What's that?

20
00:00:42,348 --> 00:00:44,526
Oh, a secret note
from my secret lover.

21
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:45,756
Where do you find the energy?

22
00:00:45,792 --> 00:00:47,131
I barely have the
strength for one lover.

23
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,697
I know, I've been
meaning to talk to you about

24
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,204
putting some more effort in.

25
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,468
That's fair.

26
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:54,180
- You working today?
- Yep, and I see you're going in early.

27
00:00:54,216 --> 00:00:56,599
Yeah, I'm going to talk to
that, uh, detective in Detroit,

28
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:58,485
see if they have any updates on Jason.

29
00:00:58,521 --> 00:00:59,851
Do you really believe

30
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:02,021
my psychotic ex-husband is on the run?

31
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:03,689
Well, it seems like it.

32
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:05,415
You can't be too careful.

33
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:08,752
I'm just happy to get some
normalcy back in our lives,

34
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:11,783
where normalcy means,
you know, double serial killers.

35
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,324
Well, on the bright side,
at least one of them

36
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,398
- is already in custody.
- Always the optimist.

37
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:17,412
It's my secret lover's
favorite thing about me.

38
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:18,955
Well, see, that's what separates us.

39
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,617
I could never pick
only one favorite thing.

40
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:25,131
Have a great day.

41
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,218
You too.

42
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:04,332
Oh, uh, Mrs. Richards?

43
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:06,627
- That's right.
- Hi, I'm Lucy Chen.

44
00:02:06,664 --> 00:02:07,974
Um, I was hoping to talk to you about

45
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,251
your former student, Seth Ridley.

46
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:11,256
I'm his training officer at the LAPD.

47
00:02:11,293 --> 00:02:13,592
- Is he in trouble?
- No, not at all.

48
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:15,563
I was just looking to get
some clarity on some things,

49
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,305
and I thought the school
guidance counselor

50
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:18,941
would be the best person to ask.

51
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:20,225
All right, then.

52
00:02:20,262 --> 00:02:22,437
Well, better come in.

53
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:23,524
Thank you.

54
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:25,729
What about you?

55
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:27,522
Sorry.
What?

56
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,605
She asked if you were feeling
any more secure in the job.

57
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,774
Oh, totally, totally. I...

58
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,633
Not.
Totally not.

59
00:02:34,678 --> 00:02:35,680
I would...

60
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:37,361
Would you actually be able to put in

61
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:39,042
a good word for me with your roommate?

62
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:40,107
That would...

63
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:41,616
I would owe you, big-time.

64
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:43,096
Hey.

65
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:45,037
- Huh?
- Think we'll be

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,015
end of shift by 8:00 tonight?

67
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,966
Ah, I-I mean, there's a
serial killer on the loose.

68
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,903
I wouldn't expect
to clock out on time.

69
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,089
There's got to be
some kind of work-life balance

70
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:56,425
- eventually, though, right?
- Not as a rookie.

71
00:02:56,749 --> 00:02:58,891
I haven't been on a
date in three months.

72
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:00,266
Why? What's at 8:00 p.m.?

73
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:02,475
He's got a long-distance
love with the missus.

74
00:03:02,511 --> 00:03:04,561
- Oh.
- We ain't married, all right?

75
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:06,248
Just exclusive since high school.

76
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,539
Camilla's still in Texas,

77
00:03:07,575 --> 00:03:09,198
looking for the right
time to move out.

78
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:10,607
And live in your car.

79
00:03:10,644 --> 00:03:12,144
I'll find a place before then.

80
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:13,610
She's my angel.

81
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:15,488
Got with me when I was
gonna make football money

82
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:18,024
and stayed with me when
I got hurt and lost it all.

83
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,747
She sacrificed a hell of a lot for me.

84
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,791
Oh, I mean, you
must miss her so much.

85
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,870
Yeah.
Yeah, I-I do.

86
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,219
All right.

87
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:42,422
Whoa!

88
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,095
Bad news...

89
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:52,397
Remy Darden succumbed
to his injuries this morning.

90
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:54,609
So you're the only living witness.

91
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:56,528
Which means we have jack squat,

92
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:59,240
because the only description
I can give of our serial killer

93
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:02,460
is white male, unknown age,
somewhere near 6 feet,

94
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:05,746
and, somewhere around 175 pounds.

95
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,498
- But it's better than nothing.
- Not by much.

96
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:10,054
Hey...

97
00:04:10,249 --> 00:04:11,525
Brought you some fresh clothes,

98
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,642
in case you want to change after,

99
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:14,588
and the appropriate shoes to match.

100
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:17,257
- Always so thoughtful.
- Ah, well-trained.

101
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:21,970
Are you okay?

102
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,639
My heart hurts.

103
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:26,725
So much pain before they died.

104
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,685
I knew in my mind such evil exists,

105
00:04:28,722 --> 00:04:31,397
but, it always shocks
my soul to see it.

106
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:34,187
- Good morning.
- Oh, morning.

107
00:04:35,754 --> 00:04:37,971
- How you feeling?
- Fine, day off helped.

108
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:40,405
I wish I could say I
found something helpful

109
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:42,240
in your absence, but I did not.

110
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:44,285
- No DNA?
- The opposite... too much.

111
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:47,038
I found trace evidence of
literally hundreds of people

112
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:48,873
contaminating both the murder lab

113
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,125
and the bodies of our
serial killer's ten victims.

114
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:52,335
How is that possible?

115
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:55,086
Oh, he muddied the
scene with a DNA buffet.

116
00:04:55,123 --> 00:04:56,714
He literally collected
medical waste...

117
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,382
Sharps, latex gloves,
discarded bandages...

118
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,844
And he used them to corrupt
everything that he touched.

119
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,428
That's kind of brilliant.

120
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,722
Uh, in a pure, evil way.

121
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,640
I mean, even if we can pull his
DNA from a victim and match it,

122
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:09,969
any defense attorney with a pulse

123
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,437
will be able to prove
reasonable doubt.

124
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:13,797
I'm afraid I have
more troubling news.

125
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:16,643
The autopsies revealed
that all but one of the victims

126
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:18,945
were infected with a variety
of bloodborne illnesses

127
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:20,556
before he strangled them to death.

128
00:05:20,592 --> 00:05:22,322
- From the used syringes?
- Yeah.

129
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,868
He was literally using them
like a science experiment.

130
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:26,326
But before you panic,

131
00:05:26,363 --> 00:05:28,746
we found the needle he
used on you and tested it.

132
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,539
I wouldn't say it was clean,

133
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:32,446
but there was nothing
communicable within.

134
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:34,665
We'll get you regular
testing for the next six months.

135
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,516
But if they didn't find
anything in the needle,

136
00:05:36,552 --> 00:05:37,677
you should be okay.

137
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,172
Okay.

138
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:40,590
But on the good news front,

139
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,884
most of the medical waste was generic,

140
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:44,111
found in every hospital and

141
00:05:44,147 --> 00:05:45,202
doctor's office around the state,

142
00:05:45,238 --> 00:05:46,672
except for these four syringes,

143
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,014
which are trial design,

144
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,952
only used at Saint Stephen Hospital.

145
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:51,143
You could have led with that.

146
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:53,103
He's an actor.
He likes the drama.

147
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,145
Former actor.

148
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:55,940
And I like setting
realistic expectations.

149
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:57,191
All right, so, just to be clear,

150
00:05:57,227 --> 00:05:59,360
we're looking for a white
male of indeterminate age,

151
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:00,735
height, weight,

152
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:02,525
with some form of connection

153
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:04,496
to Westview Psychiatric Institution

154
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,157
and Saint Stephen Hospital...

155
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:09,417
Places that employ and treat
thousands of people a year.

156
00:06:09,883 --> 00:06:11,849
Talk about setting expectations.

157
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:13,623
And here I was, feeling hopeful.

158
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,800
Sorry.

159
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:26,595
You know, I've been, uh,
really studying my rook book.

160
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:29,042
I've been burning the midnight oil.

161
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:31,641
Miles and I are going to
go to the range later on,

162
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:33,768
do some extra shooting.

163
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:37,772
I visited your high
school this morning, Ridley.

164
00:06:38,425 --> 00:06:39,650
Uh, that's cool.

165
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,026
Why?

166
00:06:41,976 --> 00:06:43,651
Because I wanted some clarity

167
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:45,655
about your high school experience.

168
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:47,855
And?

169
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:52,297
Why don't you tell me, Ridley?

170
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,289
What, what exactly did I discover?

171
00:06:54,537 --> 00:06:56,168
You found out that
I was telling the truth

172
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:57,861
about my friend who OD'd...

173
00:06:59,547 --> 00:07:01,996
And that she was not my girlfriend.

174
00:07:02,033 --> 00:07:03,340
And I did go on a date with her

175
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:05,675
a couple
months before Rory Hatcher's party.

176
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:08,470
And I did give her CPR,

177
00:07:08,566 --> 00:07:12,528
but Rory Hatcher's
dad actually saved her.

178
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:16,908
And?

179
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:22,484
And you discovered
that I lied to you and Miles

180
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:24,611
about the girl who
died in a car accident.

181
00:07:24,716 --> 00:07:26,405
And she was not my girlfriend either.

182
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:29,574
I was actually a freshman
when she was a senior,

183
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:31,993
and I've never met the girl.

184
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:37,513
Do you want to know why I lied?

185
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:39,709
I can figure that out for myself.

186
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:42,398
Well, what if I told you that
I was ashamed of what I did

187
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:44,881
and that I have struggled in the past

188
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:47,801
using these half-truths
to get me out of trouble?

189
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:49,743
I just... I've sworn to myself

190
00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:51,247
that I wasn't going to
be this guy anymore

191
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:52,668
when I joined the LAPD.

192
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:56,768
But then I threw up in a
crime scene on day one,

193
00:07:56,805 --> 00:08:00,230
and I panicked, and I should
have owned up to my failures,

194
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:01,691
but I just, I...

195
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:05,485
I should have suffered
the consequences.

196
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,908
What are the consequences?

197
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:14,661
I don't...
I don't know yet.

198
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:17,080
We have an onsite
incinerator in the basement.

199
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:19,195
It's where all of our
medical waste is disposed.

200
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:21,210
- Who has access to it?
- Custodial staff.

201
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:24,029
Plus, we have a
dedicated incineration team.

202
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:26,322
Everyone's passed background checks.

203
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:27,699
But a few months ago,

204
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:30,327
our security staff found a
patient, Ryan Dearbourne,

205
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:33,054
wandering around the
basement with a medical bag.

206
00:08:33,119 --> 00:08:35,056
At the time, he claimed he was lost.

207
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:36,590
Couldn't explain the bag.

208
00:08:36,627 --> 00:08:38,447
Back in Texas, we call that clue

209
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,978
"sweeter than stolen honey."

210
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,564
- I like him.
- No comment.

211
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:44,035
Are you seeing anyone?

212
00:08:44,072 --> 00:08:45,126
Because I have a niece,

213
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:47,068
who has had it up
to here with LA guys.

214
00:08:47,105 --> 00:08:49,821
If she's
anywhere near as lovely as you,

215
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:51,526
I'm sure she'll have her pick of men.

216
00:08:51,562 --> 00:08:53,965
- Unfortunately, I am taken.
- It's long distance.

217
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:55,130
He'll be single soon enough.

218
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,288
What do you have against
long-distance relationships?

219
00:08:57,324 --> 00:08:58,914
They aren't relationships.

220
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:01,294
The day-to-day support, the
way you weave your lives together,

221
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,542
that's a relationship.

222
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:04,378
Chatting on Zoom
is a friendship at best.

223
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:05,962
Thank you for the intel.

224
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:08,987
He and Rachel broke up
when she moved to New York.

225
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,967
Ah, I see.

226
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:12,093
Don't listen to him.

227
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,429
Relationships come in all forms.

228
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:16,745
- Let's go, Boot.
- Nice to meet you.

229
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:21,478
All right, Ryan Dearbourne

230
00:09:21,515 --> 00:09:24,481
has been a repeat patient
at Westview Psychiatric

231
00:09:24,518 --> 00:09:25,940
since he was a teenager.

232
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:28,818
His most recent stint
was 16 months ago.

233
00:09:28,855 --> 00:09:30,153
Schizophrenia,

234
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,988
borderline personality disorder,

235
00:09:32,025 --> 00:09:33,073
drug addiction.

236
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,201
Has he ever crossed
paths with Harrison Novak?

237
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:36,349
He did.

238
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:37,744
At least he could have.

239
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:41,081
There is a two-month overlap
during their teenage years.

240
00:09:41,428 --> 00:09:42,957
Okay. So...

241
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:44,355
What do you think?

242
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:45,752
Whew.

243
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:47,644
I think it looks like a...

244
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:49,806
Cautionary tale for how society fails

245
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,450
those with mental health issues.

246
00:09:51,834 --> 00:09:54,407
I mean, what do you think
about how we should approach?

247
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:57,347
Oh, right, well, uh,

248
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,766
I mean, we don't have
probable cause to enter.

249
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,309
So...

250
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:04,939
First step is to try to get
the suspect into the open.

251
00:10:05,007 --> 00:10:06,440
We could simply knock on the door,

252
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:08,608
but due to his history of violence,

253
00:10:08,746 --> 00:10:11,069
it might be better to avoid surprises.

254
00:10:11,116 --> 00:10:12,487
Good.
So?

255
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,330
- We call him.
- Perfect.

256
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:15,448
Do it.

257
00:10:26,374 --> 00:10:27,585
Hi?

258
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,573
Mr. Dearbourne?

259
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:32,841
This is Officer Celina
Juarez with LAPD.

260
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:33,883
We're outside.

261
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,293
And we're hoping we
could speak with you,

262
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:36,379
if you wouldn't mind.

263
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:41,474
Okay, well, that was disturbing.

264
00:10:41,704 --> 00:10:42,955
7-Adam-15,

265
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:45,854
requesting additional units
and an RA to my location.

266
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:48,022
Hey, go cover the rear.

267
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:17,492
In position.

268
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:19,137
No sign of suspect.

269
00:11:19,644 --> 00:11:20,901
Copy that.

270
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:22,932
I'm at the front door, making entry.

271
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:26,473
Police.

272
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:27,996
Mr. Dearbourne,

273
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:30,057
I'm coming inside.

274
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:33,084
Stand where I can see you

275
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:35,195
with your hands open and visible.

276
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,368
Sir...

277
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:44,288
I'm gonna need you to step out.

278
00:11:44,324 --> 00:11:45,663
Do it now.

279
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:01,262
Inside's clear.

280
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,169
Copy that.

281
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:04,875
Maybe he wasn't in
there when we called.

282
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:05,911
Negative.

283
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:07,836
His soup is still steaming.

284
00:12:08,197 --> 00:12:11,164
He must have jumped into the
woods the second we pulled up.

285
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,008
No, no, okay.

286
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,785
Nolan, I'm hearing a voice

287
00:12:23,822 --> 00:12:25,871
from underneath the mobile home.

288
00:12:37,802 --> 00:12:39,509
I got a hatch in the floor.

289
00:12:39,546 --> 00:12:41,427
I'm gonna open it now.

290
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:55,316
- Hey, do you have a second?
- Sure.

291
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:58,736
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

292
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:01,896
Um, okay, so I have
confirmed that Seth lied to me

293
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:04,367
on two separate occasions
about past tragedies.

294
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,119
Not great.

295
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,951
That's it, "not great"?

296
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,915
I mean, a third of the department

297
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:11,458
routinely lies about
their personal life.

298
00:13:11,494 --> 00:13:14,172
Do you honestly think Smitty
qualified for the Olympics?

299
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,465
No, but...

300
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:17,256
There's a difference
between lying on the job

301
00:13:17,292 --> 00:13:18,798
and lying about the job.

302
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:21,528
Look, has he ever lied
about a call or on paperwork?

303
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:23,720
- Not that I know of.
- Okay.

304
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:26,625
Look, the city spent a quarter
of a million training Ridley.

305
00:13:26,661 --> 00:13:27,855
The department's
currently understaffed

306
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,100
due to a major corruption scandal,

307
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:30,663
and he was recently lauded as a hero

308
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:32,041
for saving a hostage's life.

309
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,023
Grey's not going to cut
him just because he brags.

310
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:35,690
Wait, I can't believe

311
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,401
Tim "I Bounce Boots
for Breakfast" Bradford

312
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:41,146
is suggesting letting
unethical behavior slide.

313
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:42,222
I'm not.

314
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm suggesting you correct it.

315
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,179
It's what we call a "TO problem."

316
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:48,223
Wow, okay.
Thank you.

317
00:13:48,268 --> 00:13:49,394
Mm-hmm.

318
00:13:51,324 --> 00:13:53,082
- Hey.
- Hi.

319
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,375
Listen...

320
00:13:55,088 --> 00:13:56,362
I really love this job.

321
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,338
I have never lied about that.

322
00:13:58,857 --> 00:14:01,258
I just... I get panicked
sometimes, and I get stressed.

323
00:14:01,294 --> 00:14:04,599
Ridley, being a
cop is stressful 24-7.

324
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,253
Being...
Being cross-examined,

325
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:07,357
is just as stressful.

326
00:14:07,394 --> 00:14:09,153
What are you going to do
when you're on the stand,

327
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:11,303
tell the truth or say whatever
makes you look good?

328
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,303
The truth. I'm gonna
tell the truth, okay?

329
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:14,896
It's... 100%.

330
00:14:15,332 --> 00:14:18,358
This has been an important
wake-up call for me.

331
00:14:19,482 --> 00:14:22,570
I promise you, I'm gonna
fly right from here on out.

332
00:14:23,146 --> 00:14:25,573
He said the needles
were for his medicine

333
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:27,363
and that just a quick rinse,

334
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,072
and they were quote: "good as new."

335
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:33,572
That might be the most
disgusting thing I've ever heard.

336
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,012
So what do you think?

337
00:14:35,527 --> 00:14:37,627
Is this the guy you
fought in the basement?

338
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,951
I don't know.
He feels wrong.

339
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:42,965
I mean, this guy is literally
buzzing with energy.

340
00:14:43,134 --> 00:14:47,060
The killer we're after was
calm, fastidious, careful,

341
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,763
and dangerously smart.

342
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,475
I can't imagine this guy
making a peanut butter sandwich

343
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:52,976
without cutting off
something important.

344
00:14:53,012 --> 00:14:54,812
Maybe that's what
he wants us to think...

345
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:56,815
laying the groundwork
for an insanity plea.

346
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,481
If so he deserves an Oscar.

347
00:14:58,623 --> 00:15:01,442
So do you want to
talk to him or lay back?

348
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:03,394
- Lay back.
- Okay.

349
00:15:06,358 --> 00:15:07,608
Mr. Dearbourne.

350
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:08,699
Hi.

351
00:15:08,736 --> 00:15:09,951
I'm Brendon Acres,

352
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,588
with the FBI, this is Detective Lopez.

353
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,303
I take it you've been
apprised of your rights.

354
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:15,623
Is that correct?

355
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,084
I didn't do anything.
I-I-I never do anything.

356
00:15:18,121 --> 00:15:20,371
Can you tell us where
you were two nights ago?

357
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:23,925
Down below,

358
00:15:24,372 --> 00:15:25,614
the underneath.

359
00:15:25,651 --> 00:15:27,701
Are you talking about a basement?

360
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:30,638
It's my happy place.

361
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:33,766
I want to
go to my happy place.

362
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:46,028
Nice to be home?

363
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,943
So nice, especially
now that the threat

364
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,160
of my crazy ex-husband is gone,

365
00:15:51,196 --> 00:15:52,827
at least for the moment.

366
00:15:52,865 --> 00:15:53,944
You'll get through this.

367
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,277
We're all here for you,
whatever you guys need.

368
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:58,013
Thank you.

369
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:02,154
- Uh, sorry. I have to get this.
- Of course.

370
00:16:02,191 --> 00:16:03,837
- Talk to you later.
- Yeah.

371
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:12,155
- Hello?
- Tell me about Detroit.

372
00:16:12,192 --> 00:16:13,599
I shouldn't be talking to you.

373
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:15,850
Then why did you
text or answer this call?

374
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:18,311
Tell me about Detroit.

375
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:20,814
Jason's fingerprints were pulled

376
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,149
from a liquor store he robbed.

377
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:25,067
Same thing outside Provo,
Utah, two days before.

378
00:16:25,104 --> 00:16:26,861
Seems a little sloppy for our boy.

379
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:29,198
- You think it's a fake out?
- <i>I don't know. Maybe not.</i>

380
00:16:29,234 --> 00:16:31,158
People do have a
tendency to run for the hills

381
00:16:31,194 --> 00:16:32,409
when they hear that
I'm looking for them.

382
00:16:32,445 --> 00:16:33,535
I have my feelers out.

383
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:35,037
<i>I'll know more soon enough.</i>

384
00:16:36,312 --> 00:16:37,538
<i>I might have something.</i>

385
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:38,753
So I was going through Antoinette's

386
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,166
initial autopsy reports.

387
00:16:40,203 --> 00:16:41,976
All of the victims were
cross-contaminated

388
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:43,441
with dirty needles
before they were killed,

389
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:45,046
except one...

390
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:47,632
his very first victim, Grant Nogales.

391
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:49,884
First kills are often unique...

392
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,210
the thrill of raw violence

393
00:16:51,246 --> 00:16:53,013
before a serial killer
hones their style.

394
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,848
Right, and they can
also be the most personal.

395
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:57,683
So I went back into
Grant's missing person file.

396
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,311
One of the people the
detectives interviewed

397
00:16:59,347 --> 00:17:01,354
was his former employer, Liam Glasser.

398
00:17:01,391 --> 00:17:03,023
Now, Glasser was never a suspect,

399
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:05,316
but he runs a vending
machine supply company

400
00:17:05,353 --> 00:17:07,736
that services facilities
all across Los Angeles,

401
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,071
including Westview Psychiatric.

402
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,032
Any connection to Saint Stephen?

403
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:14,243
Not that I could find.

404
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,038
You should definitely
put eyes on Glasser.

405
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:17,829
See if you recognize
him from the other night.

406
00:17:17,865 --> 00:17:19,011
Yeah, but I don't want him to know

407
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:20,398
that he might be a suspect.

408
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:21,572
Yeah.

409
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:23,226
I have an idea.

410
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:26,087
Glad you could come
on such short notice.

411
00:17:26,124 --> 00:17:27,129
Are you kidding me?

412
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:30,091
I'd give my firstborn to
service all the LAPD machines.

413
00:17:30,294 --> 00:17:32,334
You really got that
kind of pull with the city?

414
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,469
Oh, yeah.

415
00:17:33,506 --> 00:17:34,912
I'm the man.

416
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:37,473
These all look like
pretty standard fare.

417
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,810
I was hoping for more
of the, uh, exotics.

418
00:17:40,847 --> 00:17:43,729
Oh, this is just a small
sampling of what we carry.

419
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,445
Was there, uh, something
specific you had in mind?

420
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:48,025
There's a New Zealand nut bar

421
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:50,653
that I could only find at the zoo.

422
00:17:50,747 --> 00:17:52,089
The Kiwi Krispie.

423
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,464
I have that.

424
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:54,657
- No way.
- Oh, yeah.

425
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,369
It's not on the truck, but I
could land it in slot, uh, 22

426
00:17:57,405 --> 00:17:59,121
first thing in the morning,
if that seals the deal.

427
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:00,830
Smitty, Grey's looking for you.

428
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,291
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

429
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:06,043
It's
never an interruption

430
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,713
when a woman is as pretty as you.

431
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:09,511
Oh, wow.
Smooth talker.

432
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,268
Guilty as charged.

433
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,421
But, don't let me stop important
police business from happening.

434
00:18:14,457 --> 00:18:15,716
I got work to do, too.

435
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:18,764
I'm gonna go talk
to Grey, and I will circle back.

436
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,725
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.

437
00:18:25,498 --> 00:18:26,814
Actually...

438
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:29,342
you might be able to help
me out with something.

439
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:31,193
Happy to,

440
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:34,522
unless this is just
a ploy to hit on me,

441
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,608
because I am a happily married man.

442
00:18:36,645 --> 00:18:38,993
Who tells random
women they're pretty?

443
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,121
- Well, men can look.
- Oh.

444
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,913
So what can I do for you, uh...

445
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,583
Uh, Nyla Harper, detective.

446
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,085
It's nice to meet you,
Nyla Harper, detective.

447
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:51,839
I'm Liam Glasser, uh, lord
of the vending machines.

448
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:54,343
Ah, that is actually what I
wanted to talk to you about.

449
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:57,178
Um, okay, so I have this case.

450
00:18:57,215 --> 00:19:00,222
It is a serial murder investigation.

451
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:03,142
And there are connections
to Westview Psychiatric.

452
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,519
Get-get out of here.
I-I service Westview.

453
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:07,063
- You're kidding.
- No.

454
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,939
Well, that is small world.

455
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:11,567
- For how long?
- Uh, I mean, like, forever.

456
00:19:11,604 --> 00:19:13,819
Uh, it's my dad's company.

457
00:19:13,912 --> 00:19:15,390
I started working with
him in high school.

458
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:18,616
I took it over when he
passed, so more than 20 years.

459
00:19:18,832 --> 00:19:20,159
How often are you there?

460
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:22,995
I average, uh, three
or four visits a month.

461
00:19:23,478 --> 00:19:25,123
I mean, the food is terrible there,

462
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:26,351
so the patients and the staff,

463
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:28,292
they basically live off the machines.

464
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:29,998
Okay.

465
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,590
I hate to impose, but,

466
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:33,824
there are elements of this case

467
00:19:33,861 --> 00:19:36,467
that date back to over a decade ago.

468
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:39,220
And talking to someone
with institutional knowledge

469
00:19:39,257 --> 00:19:41,223
would be extremely helpful.

470
00:19:41,442 --> 00:19:44,998
The staff has been stonewalling
me, trying to cover their ass.

471
00:19:45,035 --> 00:19:47,247
- You know how that is.
- Oh, yeah, it's human nature.

472
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:49,313
Exactly.
Um...

473
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,182
Can you help me?

474
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,901
Well, um,

475
00:19:52,938 --> 00:19:54,199
as much as I would
love to spend the day

476
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,385
talking to you,

477
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,076
I got
a schedule to keep.

478
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,164
Please, I promise
it won't take that long.

479
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,202
I'd owe you.

480
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,915
Sure. I can... I can
spare a few minutes.

481
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:11,207
Great, I will go grab
my file and my notebook.

482
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,452
I think Glasser is my guy.

483
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:22,813
He's the second killer.

484
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:24,847
Well, that's a surprise,

485
00:20:24,938 --> 00:20:27,947
'cause Ryan Dearbourne
is currently confessing.

486
00:20:28,171 --> 00:20:29,386
What?

487
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:30,604
I couldn't stop.

488
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:33,941
I needed them to hurt the
way I hurt, the way I hurt.

489
00:20:34,322 --> 00:20:35,901
So I jabbed them.

490
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:38,320
I jabbed them, and I killed them.

491
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:44,018
Who was the third victim?

492
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:50,124
Third kill.

493
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:53,019
M-M-M-M-Michael...

494
00:20:53,055 --> 00:20:54,105
Michael.

495
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:55,806
Skid row.

496
00:20:56,449 --> 00:21:00,500
He helped me find that
place right between the toes...

497
00:21:00,622 --> 00:21:04,054
the most painful bone, lots of nerves.

498
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:06,432
But anywhere you poke,
poke, poke too often,

499
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:07,971
they get used to it.

500
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:10,436
A-and I always had a
lot of needles to poke.

501
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:12,772
I stole them from the hospital.

502
00:21:12,954 --> 00:21:15,588
But this morning,
you told Officer Nolan

503
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:18,320
that you used those needles
in your house for medicine.

504
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:20,821
Yes, for me...

505
00:21:21,267 --> 00:21:22,615
And for them.

506
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,366
Tell us about Remy.

507
00:21:24,831 --> 00:21:26,185
Got away.

508
00:21:27,868 --> 00:21:28,958
Bye-bye.

509
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:30,456
How did he get away?

510
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:36,337
What happened the other
night when he got away?

511
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,005
Nothing.

512
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,216
Everything.

513
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:43,469
Danger.

514
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:45,805
Please, I-I just want it to stop.

515
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,265
I-I need someone to stop me.

516
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,917
Please.

517
00:21:50,745 --> 00:21:52,353
I need to be punished.

518
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,438
I've done such bad things...

519
00:21:55,578 --> 00:21:57,107
Such bad things.

520
00:22:02,236 --> 00:22:04,103
So, did he get anything wrong?

521
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,198
Miss any detail?

522
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:06,992
No, it was a slam dunk confession.

523
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:09,871
From a guy who is clearly
in the throes of mental illness.

524
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:11,373
I mean, sure, he gave us details,

525
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:13,290
but he also left a lot of holes.

526
00:22:13,327 --> 00:22:15,001
Those are details only
the killer could know.

527
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:16,377
Or someone helping him.

528
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,834
Listen, I know that my
gut is not admissible,

529
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,675
but I am telling you, Glasser
is the guy from the basement.

530
00:22:21,711 --> 00:22:23,254
He recognized me in the break room.

531
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,549
He couldn't stop staring at my wounds.

532
00:22:25,586 --> 00:22:27,388
He's still in there with Smitty,

533
00:22:27,425 --> 00:22:29,014
waiting to talk to me.

534
00:22:29,796 --> 00:22:32,268
At least just put eyes on him.

535
00:22:32,633 --> 00:22:34,044
Check my math.

536
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,856
Of course.

537
00:22:36,893 --> 00:22:39,025
The last thing I want to
do is charge the wrong guy

538
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:41,113
- or, leave an accomplice out there.
- Thank you.

539
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:42,486
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.

540
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:47,867
I swear, she'll be right back.

541
00:22:47,904 --> 00:22:49,037
I'm sorry. I got a route to run.

542
00:22:49,073 --> 00:22:50,411
I can't wait any longer.

543
00:22:50,448 --> 00:22:52,580
I am so sorry.
Thank you for waiting.

544
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:54,623
I really got to go.

545
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,001
Just talk to me for two minutes.

546
00:22:56,037 --> 00:22:57,300
That's it, I promise.

547
00:22:57,336 --> 00:22:59,086
Your stuff will be safe here.

548
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:14,927
Thank you.

549
00:23:15,014 --> 00:23:18,148
So, um, do you have any interactions

550
00:23:18,185 --> 00:23:20,482
with the patients at Westview?

551
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,110
No.
I don't really stop to chat.

552
00:23:23,661 --> 00:23:25,050
I mean, not that
there's anything wrong

553
00:23:25,086 --> 00:23:26,781
with being mentally ill,
they can't help it.

554
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:27,907
But, uh...

555
00:23:28,124 --> 00:23:29,881
I'm not really
looking to socialize.

556
00:23:29,918 --> 00:23:31,327
So is that a no?

557
00:23:32,547 --> 00:23:35,122
Yes, that is a no.

558
00:23:35,277 --> 00:23:39,335
So you have never talked to
someone named Ryan Dearbourne?

559
00:23:40,037 --> 00:23:43,421
Ah, like I said, I do my
business, and I get out.

560
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,074
Okay.

561
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,802
Is that the serial killer
you mentioned, Dearbourne?

562
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,554
I can't really comment on that.

563
00:23:50,591 --> 00:23:52,014
- Sure.
- Yeah.

564
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,141
Sure.

565
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,727
You can almost feel
him trying to be casual.

566
00:23:57,567 --> 00:24:00,864
If he is the guy, he's
rocking a world-class ego.

567
00:24:00,901 --> 00:24:02,900
It'll make him overconfident.

568
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,364
Well, if there's nothing else...

569
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,622
I really got to go.

570
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:12,618
Where were you on Tuesday night?

571
00:24:13,434 --> 00:24:14,739
Why?

572
00:24:16,406 --> 00:24:18,248
Oh, I'm sorry.
I meant to ask,

573
00:24:18,285 --> 00:24:21,116
um, were you
at Westview two nights ago?

574
00:24:21,153 --> 00:24:22,670
Something happened.

575
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,011
Well, I don't work nights.

576
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,465
I have a family.

577
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:26,715
Oh, kids?

578
00:24:26,752 --> 00:24:28,050
Yeah, two.

579
00:24:28,793 --> 00:24:30,002
What about you?

580
00:24:35,884 --> 00:24:37,685
What happened at Westview?

581
00:24:38,981 --> 00:24:40,437
There was an attack.

582
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:43,207
Our suspect almost killed a cop.

583
00:24:43,556 --> 00:24:44,900
No kidding.

584
00:24:45,162 --> 00:24:46,235
Wow.

585
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,613
Well, like I said, I wasn't there.

586
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:51,115
Where were you?

587
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:54,186
Movies maybe.

588
00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:55,995
I'd have to check.

589
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:58,706
Now I really got to go.

590
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:01,599
- Good luck with your case.
- Of course.

591
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:05,212
Uh, we will be in touch if
any follow-up is necessary.

592
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,839
Looking forward to it.

593
00:25:06,876 --> 00:25:07,965
Okay.

594
00:25:12,623 --> 00:25:14,294
I hope you catch the guy.

595
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:16,677
I mean, you must feel such a weight,

596
00:25:16,855 --> 00:25:19,059
being the only person who can...

597
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:22,021
Bring his poor victims closure.

598
00:25:23,969 --> 00:25:25,941
Does it keep you up at night?

599
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:28,819
It would...

600
00:25:28,856 --> 00:25:30,779
It would keep me up at night.

601
00:25:31,066 --> 00:25:32,656
I sleep just fine.

602
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:35,451
Do you?

603
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:37,161
Hmm.

604
00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:40,064
Like a baby.

605
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:53,801
Good job.

606
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:55,723
- So how's my math?
- Solid.

607
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,599
He's definitely giving
off some creepy vibes.

608
00:25:57,635 --> 00:25:58,933
Seemed very interested in the case.

609
00:25:58,969 --> 00:26:01,060
I agree, Ryan's involved somehow,

610
00:26:01,097 --> 00:26:03,687
but, Glasser is the
dominant personality.

611
00:26:03,724 --> 00:26:05,397
But will a jury see it that way?

612
00:26:05,434 --> 00:26:08,317
No, no, they'll see
Ryan stealing the syringes

613
00:26:08,354 --> 00:26:10,070
and Ryan confessing to serial murder.

614
00:26:10,106 --> 00:26:11,897
Glasser is just the
hardworking family man

615
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:13,524
who's barely tied to the case.

616
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:14,866
Ryan's guilt feels genuine.

617
00:26:14,902 --> 00:26:17,243
I think he honestly believes
he committed the murders.

618
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,119
What if Glasser convinced him?

619
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:21,196
You know, spent years
feeding him details

620
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:22,342
until he internalized them?

621
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:24,458
Well, we know
Glasser thinks long-term

622
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,712
from the cross-contamination
of the kills he's been doing.

623
00:26:26,748 --> 00:26:29,797
Someone as disturbed as
Ryan can easily be manipulated.

624
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:32,383
If that is true, then Glasser
has created the perfect patsy.

625
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:34,551
So, what do we do?

626
00:26:34,588 --> 00:26:36,887
Good news is, he knows we're close.

627
00:26:36,965 --> 00:26:39,181
He won't risk another
abduction anytime soon.

628
00:26:39,218 --> 00:26:41,025
Yeah, but we need to
be ready when he does.

629
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:42,912
I need every detail
about his work life...

630
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:44,770
his-his clients, route.

631
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:46,881
There has to be some
connection between him

632
00:26:46,917 --> 00:26:48,107
and the other victims.

633
00:26:48,144 --> 00:26:50,068
And let's pull apart his family.

634
00:26:50,105 --> 00:26:52,120
I need a deep dive on his wife,

635
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,363
kids, third cousins, everyone.

636
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:57,415
Oh, I'm... I'm so
sorry to interrupt.

637
00:26:57,452 --> 00:26:59,687
Nolan, Detroit PD is on
the phone looking for you.

638
00:26:59,723 --> 00:27:01,120
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

639
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:14,883
- Yeah?
- <i>Jason was never in Detroit.</i>

640
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,054
<i>He paid some meth head
to leave his fingerprints</i>

641
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,220
<i>at crime scenes.</i>

642
00:27:18,257 --> 00:27:20,055
Detroit PD just arrested the guy.

643
00:27:20,294 --> 00:27:22,499
Jason is still in LA.

644
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,396
John Nolan.

645
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,456
Hey, what are you doing, man?

646
00:28:00,492 --> 00:28:01,542
What are you doing?

647
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,408
Oh, yeah!

648
00:28:21,445 --> 00:28:23,577
Oh, that'll get the
juices flowing, huh?

649
00:28:24,043 --> 00:28:25,216
Hey, babe.

650
00:28:25,253 --> 00:28:27,706
Oh, you don't look so good back there.

651
00:28:28,189 --> 00:28:29,499
Oh, damn it.

652
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:31,376
Oh, I forgot to dump your phone.

653
00:28:31,413 --> 00:28:33,545
She's moving south on La Cienega.

654
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:36,256
<i>7-Adam-15, Bailey's
partner just called 911.</i>

655
00:28:36,293 --> 00:28:37,633
<i>Jason took her.</i>

656
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:39,092
Celina.

657
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:40,971
I know. I'm punching it.

658
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:42,930
Stupid! Stupid!

659
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:44,602
All right.
All right.

660
00:28:44,638 --> 00:28:46,174
All right.
All right.

661
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:50,020
Do I just pull over or
wait for the switch car?

662
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:52,397
Pull over and let me the hell out!

663
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:55,151
Shut up! Nobody's asking you!

664
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:58,071
I am way past taking
orders from you, Jason.

665
00:28:58,108 --> 00:29:00,491
You don't scare me anymore.

666
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:02,407
I said shut up.

667
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:09,831
Ahh! Bitch!

668
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:11,873
Ugh!

669
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:23,181
- Do you have her?
- Yeah.

670
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:24,767
One minute out.
Get ready.

671
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,473
I'm so ready, baby.
Get here.

672
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,261
Another life you're ruining.

673
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:29,841
You're the one that
ruined a life...

674
00:29:29,877 --> 00:29:30,894
Mine.

675
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:32,272
Oh, boo-hoo.

676
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,083
Jason, you're not
the hero of this story.

677
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,566
You're not even the villain.

678
00:29:36,603 --> 00:29:38,068
You're Sideshow Bob,

679
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,425
stepping on an infinite
number of rakes.

680
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,076
Look, I would really
not provoke me right now.

681
00:29:46,113 --> 00:29:47,142
Why?

682
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:48,778
Are you gonna make it hurt more?

683
00:29:48,896 --> 00:29:50,198
Such a big man,

684
00:29:50,234 --> 00:29:52,165
torturing a woman
a third of your size.

685
00:29:52,202 --> 00:29:53,333
Shut up!

686
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,020
Augh!

687
00:29:57,057 --> 00:29:59,489
Ahh!

688
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:25,907
Oh, my God!

689
00:30:26,145 --> 00:30:28,618
They stopped, two
blocks up around the corner.

690
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:35,300
[groans

691
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:38,003
Oh, my God! Baby, are you okay?

692
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:41,340
- Do I look okay?
- Don't yell at me!

693
00:30:41,377 --> 00:30:43,701
- I'm freaking out here!
- Come on, we got to go.

694
00:30:43,737 --> 00:30:45,343
- Is she dead?
- I don't know.

695
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,428
You got to make sure.

696
00:30:46,465 --> 00:30:47,597
Otherwise, you'll never rest easy,

697
00:30:47,633 --> 00:30:50,033
- and you'll never be all mine.
- Yeah.

698
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:51,641
Oh, God.

699
00:30:52,095 --> 00:30:53,669
She broke my arm!

700
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,545
Come on, we don't have
time. We got to move.

701
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:58,128
We won't make it to your car.

702
00:30:58,164 --> 00:30:59,279
Come on, we... we got to go.

703
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,073
- Where are you going?
- Come on!

704
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,458
There she is.

705
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:21,463
I'm here. I'm here.

706
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:22,756
Easy.

707
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:25,805
- How bad are you hurt?
- I don't know.

708
00:31:26,062 --> 00:31:27,480
But he's hurt worse.

709
00:31:29,106 --> 00:31:31,431
He just ran off down
the alley with a woman.

710
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:35,080
Um, blonde, uh, pink sweatshirt.

711
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:37,364
Control, suspect
Jason Wyler is on foot,

712
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:38,541
heading west towards the 101,

713
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:39,685
he is armed and dangerous.

714
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:42,021
Second suspect, blonde
female, pink sweatshirt.

715
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:43,693
Mobilize backup, airship,

716
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,321
and a supervisor to
set up a search grid.

717
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,290
You're gonna be all right.

718
00:32:10,326 --> 00:32:11,848
Ambulance is on the way.

719
00:32:11,952 --> 00:32:13,932
How did you know to find me?

720
00:32:14,094 --> 00:32:15,309
Detroit PD called.

721
00:32:15,346 --> 00:32:17,332
Jason paid someone
to plant his fingerprints.

722
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:18,728
I know.

723
00:32:19,055 --> 00:32:22,107
I mean, I-I knew we
shouldn't have trusted him.

724
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:23,984
Oh, Jason's phone...

725
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:25,819
He left that before he ran off.

726
00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:28,613
Over here!
Quick!

727
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:30,519
- Easy. Nice and easy.
- I'm okay.

728
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:33,540
Multiple contusions,
possible concussion,

729
00:32:33,697 --> 00:32:36,931
slight whiplash, and
some injury to my ribs.

730
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:39,076
It's either fractured or
sprained, I'm not sure.

731
00:32:39,112 --> 00:32:41,334
- How's Bailey?
- Bailey is pissed.

732
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:42,879
Ah, I'm gonna go to
the hospital with her.

733
00:32:42,915 --> 00:32:45,213
- Of course.
- Uh, this is Jason's phone.

734
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,877
He called the woman he ran off with

735
00:32:46,913 --> 00:32:48,175
right before we crashed.

736
00:32:49,798 --> 00:32:51,385
Hey, I-I need a name and trace

737
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:52,638
on this phone number right now.

738
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:55,474
I'll have all the units in
the area lock down the grid.

739
00:32:55,758 --> 00:32:57,758
We're not gonna let
Jason get away again.

740
00:32:57,907 --> 00:32:59,817
All right, it's registered
to Drew Davis...

741
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:03,231
uh, 28, female, lives in La Cañada.

742
00:33:05,995 --> 00:33:07,235
I know her.

743
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:08,801
No, she-she
pretended she was drunk.

744
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:09,987
She broke into the yard.

745
00:33:10,023 --> 00:33:11,324
She said she was
looking for a friend's house.

746
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,617
She must have
been trying to test out

747
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:13,897
your security system for Jason.

748
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:15,828
That's his move, make
some poor young woman

749
00:33:15,864 --> 00:33:17,687
think he's in love with her
and then ruin her life.

750
00:33:17,723 --> 00:33:18,845
Trace came in.

751
00:33:18,906 --> 00:33:20,895
It's a few blocks from
here, headed west on Sixth.

752
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:23,870
Control, suspect's
heading west on Sixth Street

753
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:26,087
toward Anderson.
Code 3.

754
00:33:26,595 --> 00:33:27,629
Go.

755
00:33:27,665 --> 00:33:29,216
- You sure?
- Go. Catch him.

756
00:33:29,459 --> 00:33:30,509
Okay.

757
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:43,230
Oh, my God.

758
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:48,562
What are we going to do?

759
00:33:48,598 --> 00:33:49,737
We... we got to get a car.

760
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:51,448
- Well, can't we just hide?
- No, no, no.

761
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:53,834
They're gonna have this
whole place locked down.

762
00:33:55,237 --> 00:33:56,249
Oh, no.

763
00:33:56,286 --> 00:33:57,791
- Your phone.
- What?

764
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:00,682
- They're tracking us.
- They know who I am?

765
00:34:00,718 --> 00:34:01,788
Why would they know who I am?

766
00:34:01,824 --> 00:34:03,190
- You said that I was fine!
- It doesn't matter!

767
00:34:03,226 --> 00:34:04,276
Come here.

768
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:05,533
All right.

769
00:34:05,663 --> 00:34:07,794
Okay, look, hey, you
got to go stop that car.

770
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,592
I'm gonna come out with a
gun, and we're gonna jack it.

771
00:34:09,628 --> 00:34:10,751
Go.

772
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:12,092
Go!

773
00:34:13,158 --> 00:34:14,344
Hi.

774
00:34:31,374 --> 00:34:33,863
Her phone's at the end of the block.

775
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,264
<i>Oh, Nolan.</i>

776
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:36,366
I see her.

777
00:34:40,655 --> 00:34:42,706
7-Adam-15, we have
eyes on one suspect.

778
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:44,499
Gunshot, possibly deceased.

779
00:34:44,536 --> 00:34:45,834
No sign of Jason yet.

780
00:34:46,207 --> 00:34:48,295
- Did Jason shoot her?
- I don't know.

781
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,915
Let's move.

782
00:35:09,678 --> 00:35:10,716
I got eyes on Jason.

783
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:12,002
<i>South side of the street.</i>

784
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:18,390
Jason!

785
00:35:18,426 --> 00:35:19,909
Show me your hands!

786
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:25,188
I give up!

787
00:35:25,658 --> 00:35:26,750
Step out!

788
00:35:26,901 --> 00:35:28,191
I can't.

789
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,117
Malvado, he's all over me.

790
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:32,534
He killed Drew.
You got to protect me.

791
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,828
Step out and show me your hands.

792
00:35:37,232 --> 00:35:38,827
Damn it, he's got a rifle!

793
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:47,426
7-Adam-15, shots fired.

794
00:35:47,462 --> 00:35:48,514
Suspect is down.

795
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:49,630
We have a sniper,

796
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:51,226
600 block of Anderson...

797
00:35:51,263 --> 00:35:52,687
precise location unknown.

798
00:36:13,536 --> 00:36:16,503
Nyla Harper, detective.

799
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:19,260
Now, I told you, I'm a
happily married man.

800
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:21,930
Yes, you did, but that was a lie,

801
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:24,974
just like everything else
you have told me was a lie.

802
00:36:25,363 --> 00:36:26,435
See, I know you're used

803
00:36:26,471 --> 00:36:27,895
to being the smartest guy in the room.

804
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:29,555
And, honestly, you
have mostly been right.

805
00:36:29,591 --> 00:36:32,558
You have played this
thing perfectly so far.

806
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:36,267
Oh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

807
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:37,797
Oh, you don't have to pretend.

808
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,215
I'm not wearing a wire.

809
00:36:39,257 --> 00:36:41,784
I'm not here
to trick you into confessing

810
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,867
or threaten you

811
00:36:42,904 --> 00:36:45,620
that Ryan Dearbourne
has flipped on you.

812
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:47,168
Like I said...

813
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:49,082
You're smarter than that.

814
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:50,458
But...

815
00:36:50,897 --> 00:36:53,339
I also know that you
can't help what you are.

816
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,256
You'll be disciplined for a while,

817
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:57,890
but then...

818
00:36:57,927 --> 00:37:00,009
You won't be able to stop yourself.

819
00:37:00,252 --> 00:37:03,138
And you will take another victim.

820
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:05,140
And we will be there.

821
00:37:06,118 --> 00:37:07,350
"We"?

822
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:10,617
My friends on patrol,

823
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:13,189
who will make driving
by your home and work

824
00:37:13,226 --> 00:37:14,400
part of every shift.

825
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:16,734
And my other friends...

826
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:20,530
My undercover friends,
who will always be out there,

827
00:37:20,757 --> 00:37:22,356
only you won't know who,

828
00:37:22,392 --> 00:37:23,950
and you won't know when.

829
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:26,165
You see, you've gotten
away with everything

830
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:27,663
because you moved in the shadows.

831
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:29,706
But now you are in the spotlight.

832
00:37:30,311 --> 00:37:31,541
And you will stay there

833
00:37:31,578 --> 00:37:33,859
until I find a way to
hang these murders

834
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,452
around your neck,

835
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,339
and lock you away, forever.

836
00:37:59,103 --> 00:38:00,324
I'm back.

837
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:02,731
I believe I only asked for a drink.

838
00:38:02,799 --> 00:38:06,434
Yes, I have that right here.

839
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:07,706
Don't open it right
away. I dropped it.

840
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:09,958
Mm-hmm. And...
and the rest of all this?

841
00:38:09,995 --> 00:38:11,247
Oh, this isn't from me.

842
00:38:11,284 --> 00:38:14,668
No, I definitely did not
impulse-buy half the gift shop.

843
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:16,920
Ah, it must have
been my secret lover.

844
00:38:16,957 --> 00:38:19,407
Yeah, and if you ask
me, that guy is really needy.

845
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:21,241
Well, maybe he's just worried,

846
00:38:21,355 --> 00:38:24,427
because I'm completely
in love with you.

847
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:28,139
To be honest, I've never
been more scared in my life.

848
00:38:29,462 --> 00:38:30,542
Me too.

849
00:38:33,288 --> 00:38:36,940
Jason has been a part
of my life for so long.

850
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:39,231
Even when he was in prison,

851
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:42,527
there was always this part
of me that was worried...

852
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,824
What he was planning,
when would he strike?

853
00:38:46,861 --> 00:38:48,493
A-and now...

854
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,908
And now you don't
have to worry anymore.

855
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:56,960
Now, is there anything else you want?

856
00:38:57,991 --> 00:38:59,796
I just want to go home.

857
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:03,633
I will go see if I can help
Luna with that paperwork.

858
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:05,426
- Hang tight.
- Yeah.

859
00:39:14,623 --> 00:39:17,173
Hey, I guess you missed
your 8:00 Zoom date.

860
00:39:17,294 --> 00:39:19,297
Yeah.
It's all right.

861
00:39:19,333 --> 00:39:20,533
- Camilla gets it.
- Mm.

862
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:22,569
- When is she moving out?
- I don't know.

863
00:39:22,622 --> 00:39:24,806
It's kind of hard to picture
her here, you know?

864
00:39:24,842 --> 00:39:27,092
The life we were planning
together was very...

865
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:28,552
- Texas.
- Mm...

866
00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:30,045
5,000-square-foot house

867
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:31,442
for half of what I pay for rent?

868
00:39:31,478 --> 00:39:32,519
Exactly...

869
00:39:32,556 --> 00:39:34,747
Marriage, three kids, the whole thing.

870
00:39:34,784 --> 00:39:37,000
- And now?
- I don't know.

871
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:39,794
I've changed a lot since
I've been here, you know?

872
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,131
And speak of the devil.

873
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,653
Hey, I-I'm gonna take this here

874
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:45,730
so I don't lose her in the elevator.

875
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:47,075
Oh, yeah. No worries.
I'll see you tomorrow.

876
00:39:47,111 --> 00:39:48,428
Yeah, see you tomorrow.

877
00:39:49,946 --> 00:39:51,912
Hey, beautiful. You're up late.

878
00:39:51,949 --> 00:39:53,224
<i>Yeah, I know,</i>

879
00:39:53,261 --> 00:39:55,810
<i>but, it's the only
flight that I could get.</i>

880
00:39:55,908 --> 00:39:57,081
"Flight"?

881
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,063
Wait, what?
Where are you?

882
00:39:59,402 --> 00:40:00,909
Surprise!

883
00:40:00,946 --> 00:40:03,276
Hey, what
are you doing here?

884
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:05,310
Oh, baby, I couldn't
wait! I quit my job!

885
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:06,654
I'm moving to Los Angeles!

886
00:40:06,691 --> 00:40:08,489
- Oh, all right.
- Come here!

887
00:40:10,323 --> 00:40:12,294
So I've been thinking
about the Seth situation.

888
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:14,255
It's been a long day.

889
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:15,689
I know this is my
problem.

890
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:17,897
I'm the TO.
So I made a decision.

891
00:40:17,948 --> 00:40:19,042
He can't stay.

892
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:20,377
The stakes are way too high,

893
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:23,314
and the only way to fix this is
to cut him from the program.

894
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,506
Okay.
Let's talk to Grey.

895
00:40:27,674 --> 00:40:29,674
Wait, you're not
gonna talk me out of it?

896
00:40:30,132 --> 00:40:32,013
No, it's your call.

897
00:40:34,162 --> 00:40:36,518
Just know this whole station
is going to be behind you

898
00:40:36,554 --> 00:40:38,146
- every step of the way.
- Thank you, sir.

899
00:40:38,182 --> 00:40:39,520
What's...
What's going on?

900
00:40:39,641 --> 00:40:42,440
It's your news to share.

901
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,213
I finally got my lab results,

902
00:40:46,249 --> 00:40:47,584
and my cancer is back,

903
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:48,736
but we caught it early,

904
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:51,116
and the doctor says
that I should still be able to work.

905
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:52,909
And, uh, I just...
I just...

906
00:40:52,946 --> 00:40:54,197
I wanted to let you know,

907
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:56,049
that I am ready, I am willing,

908
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:58,425
and able to complete my training,

909
00:40:58,666 --> 00:41:00,458
if you will still have me.

910
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:05,296
Yeah, of course.

911
00:41:07,513 --> 00:41:09,580
I am gonna sleep for a week.

912
00:41:09,616 --> 00:41:10,778
Yes, you always say that,

913
00:41:10,814 --> 00:41:11,814
and then you always pick up

914
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,138
three new hobbies with your time off.

915
00:41:13,174 --> 00:41:15,057
- This is different.
- Mm-hmm.

916
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,230
Oh, uh, I left my jacket.

917
00:41:18,313 --> 00:41:20,190
I'll grab it.
Hang on.

918
00:41:26,302 --> 00:41:27,677
There we go.

919
00:41:34,378 --> 00:41:36,786
- Did you find it?
- Yeah.

920
00:41:46,117 --> 00:41:47,905
Oh, Bailey.

921
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,717
What did you do?
