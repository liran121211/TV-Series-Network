<i>Previously on "The
Rookie"...So Officer Stanton</i>

2
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:05,222
will be taking over
the training of Officer West.

3
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:06,354
Someone broke into your home.

4
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:07,616
So, who are you claiming
these days, D?

5
00:00:07,659 --> 00:00:09,705
He did something
that really bothered me,

6
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:12,186
the way he treated
this one family -- Black family.

7
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:14,275
Hey!

8
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:16,712
I am hereby placing you
under administrative leave.

9
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:18,061
Gun and badge.

10
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:20,020
I think I could be really good
at undercover work.

11
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:22,544
The op today is simple --
trade drugs for cash,

12
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:23,806
then arrest everybody

13
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:25,677
and try to get them to flip
on Aldo Salonga.

14
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:27,244
I need to see that you
really know the science.

15
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:29,638
- Are we done?
- When it comes to your child,

16
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:31,944
there is nothing you won't do
to protect them.

17
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:33,120
Diego!

18
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:35,339
Her son was her humanity.

19
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:37,863
With him gone... War is coming.

00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,522
How's Henry?
Well, he's good.
Thanks.

23
00:00:44,566 --> 00:00:46,872
Sarah and Abigail
have him set up in Arizona.

24
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,135
He'll do his rehab there.

25
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:49,484
I'll join them
once I graduate to P2.

26
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:51,355
Ten more days.

27
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,096
Harper says your focus
is on becoming a T.O.

28
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,142
I think that's where I can do
the most good.

29
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:56,447
Any advice?

30
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,667
Think how hard it is
doing this job.

31
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,191
Now think about doing it while
babysitting an armed toddler.

32
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:02,758
Got it.

33
00:01:02,801 --> 00:01:05,848
But seriously,
if you have any more wisdom

34
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,937
on how to be better prepared,
I would appreciate it.

35
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,199
Sure.

36
00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:11,854
Automatic weapons.

37
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:13,508
A lot of them.7-Adam-19, shots fired.

38
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:14,857
Multiple shooters.

39
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,902
Crestview Cemetery.
Requesting airship and backup.

40
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:18,426
And mobilize SWAT.

41
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:32,440
Where <i>are</i> these guys?

42
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,146
Come on! Let's go!

43
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:54,636
Up here.

44
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:57,117
Police! Don't move!

45
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:01,686
Got him? Yeah.

46
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:08,258
How did he make it this far
in this condition?

47
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:09,999
Heat of battle.

48
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:12,567
7-Adam-19, one in custody,
not conscious, not breathing.

49
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,831
Let's go find out
where he was coming from.

50
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:44,207
--Captions by VITAC--

51
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,643
Look, I don't want to alarm you,

52
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:47,297
but our guest list
is out of control.

53
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,516
What are you talking about?

54
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:50,213
I mean we're almost
at maximum capacity

55
00:02:50,257 --> 00:02:51,997
and half your cop friends
haven't even responded yet.

56
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:56,698
Yeah, cops don't really respect
RSVPs, especially for --

57
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:59,744
Especially for what?

58
00:02:59,788 --> 00:03:01,485
First marriages. Uh-huh.

59
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:04,096
So they just think
that I'm your starter husband?

60
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,229
Yes, but if it makes you feel
any better,

61
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:09,319
I'm 72% certain
you're my forever husband.

62
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:12,104
Only 72%?
It goes up to 81%
if you make me breakfast.

63
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:17,109
Lopez.

64
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:19,111
Yes, sir. Text me the address.

65
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:20,591
What?

66
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:23,768
The war just started.

67
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:36,259
Hey. Looks like Cesar Madrigal's
been using the cemetery

68
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,130
as a supply depot.

69
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:41,090
Guys were loading a car
with narcotics, got ambushed.

70
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,918
La Fiera?
Definitely her
Malos Dorados.

71
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:44,572
All sporting
the yellow sneakers.

72
00:03:44,615 --> 00:03:46,313
Looks like she sent
five shooters,

73
00:03:46,356 --> 00:03:47,662
including the one
that was shooting at us.

74
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:49,838
They came in on foot
and opened up on Cesar's guys.

75
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:52,319
Unfortunately for yellow kicks,
they miscounted the enemy.

76
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:55,017
Got caught in a crossfire of two
of Cesar's crew they didn't see.

77
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,019
In less than a minute,
there's a baker's dozen of DBs.

78
00:03:57,062 --> 00:03:58,455
- You up to speed?
- Getting there.

79
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,675
- Where's Sergeant Caradine?
- Sweating the cemetery owner.

80
00:04:00,718 --> 00:04:03,155
She's clearly
on Cesar's payroll.

81
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,158
This is only gonna get worse.
La Fiera's out for blood.

82
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:09,031
And Cesar is just strong enough
to put up a decent fight.

83
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:10,380
You don't think he can win? No.

84
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:12,469
La Fiera has a lot more
resources than Cesar

85
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,602
and, honestly,
a level of brutality

86
00:04:14,645 --> 00:04:16,647
that his crew's never seen
-before.
-We can't just stand by

87
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,953
and watch them
shoot up the city.

88
00:04:17,996 --> 00:04:19,302
I mean, we got lucky this time.

89
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:21,043
No innocents were hurt,
but that can't last.

90
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:23,350
Word is Sandra flew back from
Guatemala after burying Diego.

91
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,003
She's bunkered down
at Hotel Mathilde.

92
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:26,353
Rented out
the whole ninth floor.

93
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,311
- Good to be queen.
- What about Cesar?

94
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:30,531
According to Narcotics,
he's in the wind.

95
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:32,141
I know someone
who might have some insight

96
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:34,404
on where to find him --
Mack Daniels.

97
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:36,928
He was working for Cesar's dad
after getting fired by LAPD.

98
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:38,713
- Will he talk to you?
- Got him into rehab.

99
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:40,410
I can give him a call,

100
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:42,107
see if he has any idea
where Cesar might hole up.

101
00:04:42,151 --> 00:04:44,545
Do it.
And you -- go talk to La Fiera.

102
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:47,069
Impress on her
the need to stand down.

103
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:48,331
Cesar killed her son.

104
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,898
I don't think
there's anything I can say

105
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,073
that'll get through to her.

106
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:52,944
But I'll try.

107
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,990
Thank you. Alright.

108
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:57,993
And <i>I</i> thought my day was gonna
be chasing down cop RSVPs

109
00:04:58,036 --> 00:04:58,994
for the wedding.

110
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:00,517
It'll only take like two minutes

111
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:04,086
for La Fiera to tell you
to go screw yourself, so...

112
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:07,568
We should split the RSVP list.
It'll get done faster.

113
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:10,701
Yeah. I'm not doing that.

114
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:12,268
Fine. E-mail me the list.

115
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,835
Thank you.

116
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,445
Should've read the fine print

117
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:17,534
on that whole man-of-honor
thing.
No kidding.

118
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:19,623
I'm just saying,
the cop who tackles the perp

119
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,886
should be the one
to do the paperwork.
What? No.

120
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,540
The cop who didn't risk life
and limb

121
00:05:23,584 --> 00:05:26,195
running down a methed-out
sous-chef should have to do it.

122
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:28,284
Otherwise, you are
disincentivising

123
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,677
- hands-on policing.
- Ooh.

124
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,982
You could just let me go.

125
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:33,637
Then there's no paperwork.

126
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:36,988
Oh. What's that, Sarge?
You need me?

127
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:38,773
Sorry, partner.
Paperwork's all yours.

128
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:40,775
Fine, but you are
tackling the next three guys.

129
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,342
- Uh-huh.
- Let's go.

130
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:44,561
You can teach me
what the hell sous vide is.

131
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:48,870
Yes, sir?

132
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:51,612
You heard about the mass
casualty event this morning?

133
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:54,049
Uh, yes, sir, but we knew
a gang war was coming, right?

134
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:56,747
Yes. And it's far from over.

135
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,055
Which, Detective Harper tells
me, presents an opportunity.

136
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:02,013
In times of chaos like this,

137
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,537
it's not just
the criminal pecking order

138
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,668
that gets shaken up.

139
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:07,236
Undercover operations
get upended.

140
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,108
Long-term UCs and CIs
are neutered

141
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:11,501
when their bosses get killed
or caught.

142
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,982
But the upheaval
also gives us a chance

143
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,853
to put new UCs in the field.

144
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:18,029
I got a call from June Zhang
this morning.

145
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:19,422
Aldo Salonga is out of prison,

146
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:22,599
and he is desperate
to cook product to move.

147
00:06:22,643 --> 00:06:25,776
So he called her cover identity
and asked about you.

148
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,387
You want me to go back in
as the chemist?

149
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,432
June is already up
on another operation,

150
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:31,434
so she told Salonga
that you might be available.

151
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,002
I'm ready. Not so fast.

152
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,091
This wouldn't be a sting
operation like the last time.

153
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:38,615
This would probably be
a long-term placement.

154
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,530
Which means you'll be
on your own,

155
00:06:40,574 --> 00:06:42,924
without a surveillance team
or access to immediate backup.

156
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:45,927
It normally takes months
to properly train an officer

157
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,842
to go deep undercover like this.

158
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:50,584
Hundreds of hours of classroom
and field training.

159
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:52,760
I told Detective Harper
she has today

160
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:54,936
to evaluate your readiness.

161
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,851
If she doesn't sign off
with confidence

162
00:06:56,894 --> 00:06:58,200
that you can handle it,

163
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:00,376
I will not approve
the assignment.

164
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,986
Yes, sir.

165
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,597
I won't let you down.

166
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,730
It's not about letting me down,
Officer Chen.

167
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:10,168
There is no failure
for finding yourself unprepared

168
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,170
for a job
you did not prepare for.

169
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,694
Is that clear? Yes, sir.

170
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,260
Go get changed.

171
00:07:15,304 --> 00:07:16,827
I'm throwing you
in the deep end.

Nice hideout.

187
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:57,694
It's not a hideout.
It's a base of operations.

188
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:00,262
I know you.
You were at my dad's hospital.

189
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:02,743
That's right. The day
you tried to kill La Fiera.

190
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:05,006
- Allegedly.
- Nothing alleged about
what happened this morning.

191
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,964
-You lost a lot of men.
And product.

192
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:08,575
I don't know
-what you're talking about.
-Sure, you do.

193
00:08:08,618 --> 00:08:10,315
You started a war you can't win.

194
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,100
Says who? Everybody.

195
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:13,971
You're a minor league ball club
next to Fiera.

196
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,757
Even if you <i>could</i> compete,
you killed her son.

197
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,454
She's out for blood. Your blood.

198
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,238
But she's also a businesswoman.

199
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:22,980
Wars are expensive.
Unpredictable.

200
00:08:23,024 --> 00:08:25,635
Word is she made a deal
with your father to take over.

201
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,594
Now, if you offered
to honor that deal,

202
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,726
she might let you walk away
with your life.

203
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,600
What belonged to the father
will be inherited by the son.

204
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:35,079
That's in the Bible.

205
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,733
So this bitch can run around
all she wants

206
00:08:36,777 --> 00:08:38,343
claiming she made
some sort of deal with my dad,

207
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:39,910
- but no one's gonna believe it.
- You better hope not.

208
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:42,347
If you lose the support
of your father's lieutenants,

209
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:44,480
they'll jump ship and you'll be
all by your lonesome.

210
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,963
Hey, you guys wouldn't happen to
know where La Fiera is, right?

211
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,400
In case I want to pay
my respects.

212
00:08:51,443 --> 00:08:53,576
Sorry. You'll have to figure
that one out on your own.

213
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,970
Yeah. I'm working on it.

214
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:58,973
So, what now?

215
00:08:59,016 --> 00:09:01,584
Hope Lopez is doing better
with La Fiera.

216
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,370
Police.

217
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:07,634
I'm here to talk
to Sandra de la Cruz.

218
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:10,985
Detective Lopez.
We haven't met yet.

219
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,290
No, but you match
the description

220
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:14,075
of the man who threatened
my fiancé.

221
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:16,556
That doesn't sound like me.
I get along with everyone.

222
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,209
And yet I can tell you're not
gonna get along with me.

223
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:19,428
My heart breaks.

224
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:20,821
Is Sandra inside?

225
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,649
- Do you have a warrant?
- Not yet.

226
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:23,780
Is that a problem?

227
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:25,565
Not yet.

228
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,875
<i>Hermana.</i>

229
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,617
Thank you for the flowers
you sent for Diego's funeral.

230
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:36,271
They were lovely.

231
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,578
We held the service
at Casa de Dios.

232
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,841
Thousand attended
and walked with me

233
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:43,408
as we buried him
in Chichicastenango --

234
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:44,845
in a bright yellow tomb

235
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:47,282
to honor the sunshine
he brought into my life.

236
00:09:47,325 --> 00:09:49,371
You should've stayed
in Guatemala.

237
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:50,938
No.

238
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,724
I have unfinished business here.

239
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,813
Listen to me.

240
00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:58,380
Up until this point,

241
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,469
you've managed to fly
mostly under the radar,

242
00:10:00,512 --> 00:10:02,471
away from the eyes
of federal law enforcement.

243
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:04,865
But you announced yourself
in a big way this morning.

244
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:07,607
A dozen dead bodies elevates you
to the top of the watchlist.

245
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,870
I have nothing left to lose, <i>
hermana.</i>

246
00:10:09,913 --> 00:10:12,437
But there is a very simple thing
you can do to end this war

247
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:13,743
before it goes any farther.

248
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,397
And what's that?

249
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,008
We both know
you were wiretapping

250
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:20,837
a dying man's hospital room.

251
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,971
You heard him promise
to give me control,

252
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:27,235
but he slipped into a coma
before he could tell his people.

253
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,152
You want this war to end?
Give me that recording.

254
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:38,420
You were offered <i> a</i> plus-one.

255
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,770
You -- You crossed that out
and wrote "plus four."

256
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:44,948
N-- Emotional support animals
are not wedding guests.

257
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,213
Hey, Mildred. John Nolan here.

258
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:51,955
Yeah. Uh, so, listen.
Here's the thing.

259
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:54,218
What Tim is too embarrassed
to say is that he screwed up.

260
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:56,090
He told Angela
the wrong venue cap.

261
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:59,702
Now they have too many guests.
We just need a few people t--

262
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,269
You will? Thank you so much.

263
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:02,618
I know the couple will be
so pleased.

264
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,185
Alright. Bye.

265
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:05,839
Are you proud of yourself?

266
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:07,928
Throwing a fellow officer
under the bus?

267
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:10,017
I think Detective Lopez
would approve of my methods.

268
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,540
Mm.

269
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:18,939
Control, 7-Adam-19.

270
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:22,290
Run a plate --
3-John-Robert-Queen-1-5-8.

271
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,334
Send details to our box.

272
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,905
His name is Miguel Offer.

273
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,298
He's got quite a list of priors.

274
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:31,734
We're getting
a very good picture

275
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:33,344
of Cesar's operation here.

276
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,172
Yeah. Too bad none of this intel
will be relevant

277
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:36,957
once La Fiera wipes him off
the map.

278
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,093
Hey. How'd it go?

279
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,269
The good news is I can stop
the war.

280
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:46,749
How?

281
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:48,751
By giving La Fiera
the wire-tap recording

282
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,666
of her and Madrigal
making their deal.

283
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,320
Well, let's do it.
We'll stop the body count.

284
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:53,582
Not all of it.

285
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,323
She's gonna kill Cesar
no matter what.

286
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:57,542
Better one homicide
than a second massacre.

287
00:11:57,586 --> 00:12:00,067
Can we do that, though,
ethically speaking --

288
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,503
pick the winner of a drug war?

289
00:12:01,546 --> 00:12:02,983
What's our number-one mandate?

290
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:05,550
Protect the lives
of the people of Los Angeles.

291
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:08,336
So we end the violence today.
We go after La Fiera tomorrow.

292
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,468
Exactly.
I'll run it up the flagpole.

293
00:12:10,512 --> 00:12:11,905
Any luck finding Cesar?

294
00:12:11,948 --> 00:12:14,255
He's up in Acton,
holed up in a cabin.

295
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:15,909
We're documenting the comings
and goings of his crew,

296
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:18,041
keeping an eye out
-for trouble.
-I got to go.

297
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:20,740
Looks like the feds have joined
the party.

298
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,744
I'm headed
to my lady doctor next.

299
00:12:24,787 --> 00:12:26,441
Want to come to that, too?

300
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:29,836
Special Agent Taggart, DEA.
We need to talk.

301
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,011
Well, thanks for agreeing
to talk to me.

302
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:32,273
Of course. Yeah.

303
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:34,014
Nolan said
you were interviewing cops

304
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,755
for your book on police reform.

305
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,408
I'd talk about that all day.

306
00:12:37,452 --> 00:12:39,715
John mentioned that you come
from a police family.

307
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,369
Yep.

308
00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:44,764
Dad, my uncles, two aunts,
half a dozen cousins.

309
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,635
Yeah, the Wests are blue
through and through.

310
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:47,592
And Black.

311
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:49,116
Yeah.

312
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,553
Um, you want to know
if being Black

313
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:53,511
affects my stance
on police reform.

314
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:54,599
Does it?

315
00:12:54,643 --> 00:12:56,427
Hell yeah.

316
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:59,648
I've seen firsthand
how the right kind of policing

317
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:02,999
can serve our communities
and make people's lives better.

318
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:07,351
So when an officer abuses their
power in those communities,

319
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:09,440
- I take it personally.
- That's interesting.

320
00:13:09,484 --> 00:13:11,007
Given your family,
I might've expected

321
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,661
a blue-wall-of-silence answer
from you.

322
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:16,186
There definitely was a time when
I had more faith in the system,

323
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,450
but recently I've seen firsthand
how broken it is.

324
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,017
How so?

325
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:25,456
It needs to be a lot easier
to fire bad cops.

326
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,808
I almost died trying.

327
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:37,817
Why the cloak and dagger?

328
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,733
You were in La Fiera's hotel
suite for 17 minutes, 9 seconds.

329
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:42,909
What'd you talk about?

330
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:45,172
Makeup tips,
cutest members of BTS --

331
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:46,521
Be careful, Detective.

332
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:48,349
You just got
to the big kids' table.

333
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:50,046
I can easily have you
put back in uniform.

334
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,526
No, you can't.

335
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:54,007
You know what else
you apparently can't do?

336
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,617
Wiretap La Fiera.

337
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,924
Because if you could,
you wouldn't be asking me

338
00:13:57,967 --> 00:14:00,883
what we talked about
for 17 minutes and 9 seconds.

339
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,667
Now, why am I here?

340
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:07,237
I'm running a multi-agency
task force -- DEA, FBI, BNE.

341
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:08,456
Why not LAPD?

342
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:09,718
We're on the front lines
of this.

343
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,589
You should be bringing us in.

344
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,244
I have over 25 years' experience
dealing with cartels.

345
00:14:14,288 --> 00:14:16,290
I say when it's time
to bring in local PD.

346
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,900
So, here's the carrot.

347
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,423
You tell me what you know,

348
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:22,252
and I'll consider inviting you
into the inner sanctum.

349
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:25,386
We have a recording
of Tomás Madrigal

350
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:27,910
giving La Fiera control
of his drug operation.

351
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:30,565
- I want a copy of that tape.
- That's funny. So does she.

352
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:33,350
To cement her control, which is
why you can't give it to her.

353
00:14:33,394 --> 00:14:35,744
We need time to analyze that,
go over the angles.

354
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:37,311
Do you even speak Spanish?

355
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:38,834
What does that have to do
with anything?

356
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,489
<i>Veinticino años de experiencia
con los carteles.</i>

357
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:44,318
<i>¿Hablas el idioma?
¿Conoces la cultura?</i>

358
00:14:44,361 --> 00:14:46,494
<i>Vez como la política
de los Estados Unidos</i>

359
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:48,931
<i>ha creado mas caos y crimen
en América Latina?</i>

360
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,413
No wonder we're losing.

361
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,850
Look, I'll take your request
under advisement,

362
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,983
but it's LAPD's recording.

363
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:58,419
We'll decide what we do with it.

364
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:01,509
Now, you see,
you played that all wrong,

365
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:04,251
because unlike you, your boss
knows that the best path

366
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:07,732
to putting La Fiera behind bars
is through a federal court.

367
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:10,953
So I'm just gonna go
over your head,

368
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:15,827
take that tape, and leave you
watching from the sidelines.

369
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:23,574
So, what's my first test?

370
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:25,576
Buying drugs
without getting ID'd or...

371
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,491
Are you going undercover
as a tweaker?

372
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:30,538
No.
So that wouldn't be
a very useful test.

373
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:33,976
I can't cram 100 hours' worth
of training into one shift,

374
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,804
so I have to get to the heart

375
00:15:35,847 --> 00:15:39,416
of what you need to know
in order to survive.

376
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,245
When you are a UC,
you have to be on triple duty.

377
00:15:42,289 --> 00:15:44,247
So what does that mean?

378
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,162
It means I need to keep three
things in my head at all times.

379
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:47,990
Yes. What are they?

380
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,558
First I always have to be aware
of the law

381
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:52,386
and proper procedure.

382
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:53,996
There are certain actions
I can take as a UC --

383
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,346
I can be the lookout
for a burglary.

384
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,218
I can drive the getaway car --

385
00:15:58,261 --> 00:16:00,568
and a lot of actions
that I can't take.

386
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:02,048
I can't get high.

387
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,702
I can't assault
or victimize someone.

388
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:07,836
- Second?
- I always have to be
my character,

389
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:12,014
spend every moment channeling
Nova Lin and not Lucy Chen.

390
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,581
Third? Um...

391
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:15,017
Oh, shoot.

392
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:17,237
You have to not get caught
or killed.

393
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,240
Right.
If you really were
a drug cook,

394
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,198
the only thing
that you would be worried about

395
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,374
is whether you are getting paid
or popped

396
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,289
at the end of your cook.

397
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,553
But as a UC, you have to have
three complicated streams

398
00:16:29,597 --> 00:16:32,992
of consciousness going through
your mind at all times.

399
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,645
How much time have you spent
on your backstory?

400
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,691
I've filled four journals.

401
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:38,258
What?

402
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,303
It's -- It's just
gonna be interesting

403
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:42,653
to see what you thought
was important about Nova

404
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,090
and what was not.

405
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:46,657
Anyway, I'mma step out.

406
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:50,313
I'm gonna give you five minutes
to get into character,

407
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:53,142
and then we are going
to a party.

408
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:58,756
Officer West,

409
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,062
we just received
an anonymous tip

410
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,368
on one of La Fiera's
strongholds.

411
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:03,413
Units from Hollywood Division
are on their way.

412
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,198
Meet them there
and keep me in the loop.

413
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,416
Yes, sir.

414
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,070
You think Cesar Madrigal
called it in

415
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,332
so we'd do his dirty work
for him?

416
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:11,334
I do, which makes him smarter
than I thought.

417
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:12,988
Yes, sir.

418
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,468
Still, we'd rather arrest
these guys quietly

419
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:16,078
than have a repeat
of this morning's bloodshed.

420
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:18,080
I'm on my way.

421
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:31,789
Hey. Officer West, Mid-Wilshire.

422
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,356
Came by to see
if you guys needed a hand.

423
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,445
Thanks. We're just bringing
the rest of the guys out now.

424
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,012
Found enough long guns
to arm a small battalion.

425
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,015
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.

426
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:48,154
- You were fired.
- Was.

427
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:50,025
Turns out being saddled
with an incompetent rookie

428
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,505
isn't grounds for termination,

429
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:54,334
even if that rookie's daddy
does run IA.

430
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,336
This is the rookie
you were telling us about?

431
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:59,078
Yep. Officer Jackson West.

432
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,992
The kid who stabbed me
in the back.

433
00:18:01,036 --> 00:18:02,820
Let's go.

434
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,010
Sniper. Where you been?

435
00:18:19,054 --> 00:18:21,491
I had some trouble.
Nothing I couldn't handle.

436
00:18:21,535 --> 00:18:23,145
This -- This is Nova.

437
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,539
I don't think
you two have met yet.

438
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:27,758
I'd remember. Likewise.

439
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:30,413
Careful.

440
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:33,286
You're about to burn
that burger.

441
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:35,810
You know your way
around a grill?

442
00:18:35,853 --> 00:18:37,899
I usually cook in
a more controlled environment.

443
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:40,031
That so? What do you cook?

444
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,643
All sorts. Mainly catering.

445
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:45,254
Big orders.

446
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:47,126
Nova came through for me
recently.

447
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:51,478
Uh, I'mma go grab a beer.
You two talk.

448
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:53,654
Where'd you learn to cook?

449
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:54,959
Here and there.

450
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:56,874
But every top chef
needs formal training.

451
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,181
Sure, but I only just met you.

452
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,140
You don't see me asking
where you did time.

453
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:05,840
What makes you think I did time?

454
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,233
Nature of the beast.

455
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:08,495
Well, if you're friends
with Sniper,

456
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:09,670
that means
you're in the business,

457
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:11,062
and if you're in the business,

458
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:13,326
eventually you catch a charge.

459
00:19:17,547 --> 00:19:20,028
I might be able to use someone
with your background.

460
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,943
Yeah, I'll need to do
my due diligence first.

461
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:23,249
I only work with professionals.

462
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:25,381
Well, by all means, ask around.

463
00:19:25,425 --> 00:19:28,254
Why do you have to be
so complicated?

464
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:29,864
I'm not being ridiculous.

465
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:32,693
- Something wrong?
- No.

466
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,999
Just get in the car.
Get in the freakin' car.

467
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,698
Get your hands off of me!

468
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:38,786
Do you know them?

469
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,222
No. Let's go.

470
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:41,745
I just don't like seeing a girl
being mistreated.

471
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,791
I can fix that.

472
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,967
Watch the grill.

473
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,142
Hey!

474
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,101
Yeah, you! Boy! Come here!

475
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:52,365
- What's the problem?
- This kid put his hands
on the girl.

476
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:53,844
Nova didn't like it.

477
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:55,759
Yeah. She's, uh,
she's sensitive that way.

478
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:58,240
Me, I think a girl could use
a little more focus.

479
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:00,938
What?

480
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,113
Go on. Tell him.

481
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:03,941
You should treat that girl
better.

482
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:05,769
Kiss my ass.

483
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,684
What did you say to me?

484
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:08,772
Nothin'. Sorry.

485
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:09,947
Won't happen again.

486
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:12,472
See that it doesn't.
Now piss off.

487
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,564
Nice gun.

488
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:18,782
It's all right.

489
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,785
It's a cop gun.

490
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,921
Yeah.

491
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:29,358
They use 'em 'cause they're
reliable when things get real.

492
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:30,881
It's good enough for me.

493
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,150
Well, let's eat.

494
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:43,807
Let's eat!

495
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:51,075
Took you long enough.

496
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,947
L.A. traffic.
What do you want from me?

497
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,644
Got one unmarked car,

498
00:20:54,688 --> 00:20:57,168
two sets of civvies
fresh from lost-and-found.

499
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:59,606
You were supposed to
pull clothes from our lockers.

500
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:00,911
We texted you our combinations.

501
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:02,217
Oh, I didn't do that.

502
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,175
Why do we rely on you
for anything?

503
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,177
I've been wondering that myself.

504
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:10,617
Oh, um, Smitty, one more thing.
Um, about Lopez's wedding.

505
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,358
Yeah.
- She got my RSVP, right?
- Yeah, that's just it.

506
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:15,970
You can't send an RSVP card to a
wedding you weren't invited to.

507
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:17,928
Oh, of course I'm invited.
I'm the deejay.

508
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:22,585
He's not the deejay.
You're not the deejay!

509
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,021
It's not right.

510
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:25,371
Those bodies
are on <i>our</i> murder board.

511
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:27,547
The DEA can't just force us
to follow their command.

512
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,679
That tape could end
the bloodshed right now.

513
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,594
Angela, stop. The Chief already
sent the recording to the feds.

514
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:33,117
You have to let this go.

515
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,858
He's back.

516
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,512
- Who?
- Doug Stanton.

517
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,906
He was dispoed on our pinch.
He's back on the job.

518
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:40,516
- He's in the Hollywood Division.
- Damn it.

519
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,518
I'm so sorry.

520
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:44,999
Looks like Stanton appealed
his termination and won.

521
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:47,131
What, and --
and no one cared to tell me?

522
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:48,524
The brass is under no obligation

523
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:50,178
to notify you or me
of their rulings.

524
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:53,703
After everything he did,
not a single repercussion?!

525
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,226
That's not entirely true.

526
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,228
He lost his seniority
and got demoted to P2,

527
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,230
where he'll be
for the rest of his career.

528
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:00,449
He'll never be
a training officer again.

529
00:22:00,493 --> 00:22:02,103
But he still wears the badge.

530
00:22:02,146 --> 00:22:04,758
The Police Commissioner
and the Board of Rights

531
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:06,455
ended up seeing things his way.

532
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:07,891
Because they were
more interested

533
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:09,153
in avoiding
a wrongful-termination suit

534
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:11,373
than punishing a corrupt cop.

535
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:14,985
Look, Sarge.

536
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:17,640
This man left me there to die.

537
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:21,557
This isn't over.

538
00:22:21,601 --> 00:22:23,429
I'm gonna bring it up
at the Sergeants Staff meeting.

539
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:24,821
I am not done fighting for you.

540
00:22:24,865 --> 00:22:26,910
Yeah. Don't bother.

541
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:29,957
We both know
it won't do any good.

542
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,307
Stanton won.

543
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,398
Thank you very much.

544
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,835
And now we have cut the list
by 27 guests.

545
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,184
That's not bad.

546
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:42,012
You told them
I was so guilt-ridden

547
00:22:42,056 --> 00:22:43,405
I've been crying in bed all day.

548
00:22:43,449 --> 00:22:44,754
It really helped paint
the picture.

549
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:46,843
You do remember I hold your fate
in my hands?

550
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:49,237
Duly noted.

551
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,066
Control, 7-Adam-19, be advised.

552
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:53,415
Cesar is on the move
with his crew.

553
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,635
Requesting airship
to aid in our surveillance.

554
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:59,073
-I did good, right?
You did great.

555
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:01,467
--I knew it was a setup.
-No, you didn't.
-No, you didn't.

556
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,990
Okay.
I couldn't know for sure, but --

557
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,295
You should be in school.

558
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:05,993
Relax. Nyla wrote me a note.

559
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:07,516
- See you tonight?
- Yeah.

560
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,736
Uh, hey, who was that boy?

561
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,131
Do <i>you</i> know?
They're not dating, right?

562
00:23:14,175 --> 00:23:16,569
Because I did <i>not</i> like that kid.

563
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,092
Never mind.

564
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:19,833
So, what's next?

565
00:23:19,876 --> 00:23:21,574
You never know what comes next
when you're undercover,

566
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:23,184
so why would I tell you now?

567
00:23:48,905 --> 00:23:50,951
Get your ass off my desk.

568
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:53,127
Are you not housebroken yet?

569
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,564
We decided that Sandra de la
Cruz can have the recording.

570
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:57,697
You could have called
to tell me that.

571
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,959
So why are you here?

572
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:01,048
We installed malware
on this drive.

573
00:24:01,091 --> 00:24:02,789
She plugs this into
her computer,

574
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:04,660
snakes its way
throughout her entire network --

575
00:24:04,704 --> 00:24:06,575
tablets, phones, routers.

576
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,622
In one fell swoop, we get
evidence on the whole operation.

577
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:11,580
But you need someone she trusts
to deliver it to her.

578
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:13,582
Is this really the best idea
you've got --

579
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:15,105
a glorified spam link?

580
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:17,760
Will you give it to her or not?

581
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,648
A booty call?

582
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:37,998
He's in the middle of a gang war
and that's his priority?

583
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:39,826
That's how his father knew
he would just run the business

584
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,436
into the ground.

585
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,264
That's why he sold out
to La Fiera.

586
00:24:43,307 --> 00:24:45,005
Let's find out
who this girlfriend is.

587
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:46,702
I'll run her plates. Control?

588
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:50,227
Officer West.

589
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,316
Professor Ryan.
What can I do for you?

590
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,796
Well, Jackson called to tell me

591
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,016
about Officer Stanton
being reinstated.

592
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,452
He asked for my help.

593
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,454
- What kind of help?
- Exposure.

594
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,674
A Black rookie officer
being abused and left to die

595
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:05,242
by his white T.O.,
and the guy keeps his job?

596
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:07,897
If it were up to me,
we'd be on CNN right now.

597
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:09,246
So what's stopping you?

598
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:11,553
I felt like I owed you
a heads-up, sir.

599
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,033
Son, you don't owe me anything.

600
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:14,774
I understand your anger,

601
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:17,385
just like I understand
your instinct to go public.

602
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:19,343
But I believe you'll be making
a mistake.

603
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:21,563
The Department has
left me with no other option.

604
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:23,739
If my life is worth less
to the Department

605
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:26,568
than the cost of a lawsuit,
why should I protect them?

606
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,483
You shouldn't.
You should protect yourself.

607
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,007
And I'm telling you, going
on TV, putting Doug on blast

608
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:33,575
will just cause the Department
to circle their wagons.

609
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:37,536
They will shield Doug
to defend their own reputation.

610
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,755
You'll be inadvertently
making a martyr out of him

611
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,452
and isolating yourself.

612
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,498
And that right there
is why things will never change.

613
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,110
Until cops speak up
about what is really happening,

614
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:49,199
- change will never come.
- I hear you.

615
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:51,201
But at what cost?
This young man's career?

616
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:54,378
Sarge, I have to do something.

617
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:57,599
Jackson is willing to step up
and risk losing everything.

618
00:25:57,643 --> 00:25:59,470
But you insist it won't work.

619
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:01,124
So tell me. What will?

620
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:02,735
You've been a cop
for a long time.

621
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:05,607
Tell me what we can do
to make the department turn

622
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:07,957
against Doug Stanton.

623
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,133
Or we'll be on the 6:00 news.

624
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:15,791
Lucy Chen,
meet Sergeant Mark Murray --

625
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:17,924
aka Shea.

626
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:20,491
Uh...

627
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:22,189
It's a pleasure, sir.

628
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:24,191
And that burger
was truly delicious.

629
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:26,454
Thank you. You made
a nice save with the kid.

630
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:28,412
Besides being a grill master,

631
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:32,591
Shea is a court-certified expert
in clandestine narcotics labs.

632
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,462
Manufacturing dope
is part of my official duties.

633
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:36,246
Now, Detective Harper informs me

634
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,465
that you're gonna be posing
as a chemist.

635
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:40,642
- Yes, sir.
- Okay. Come on.

636
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:45,168
So, Dilaudid,
meth, heroin, fentanyl.

637
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:46,387
Chemically speaking,
what's the difference

638
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,345
between nasal decongestant
and meth?

639
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:50,826
One oxygen molecule. Just one.

640
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,175
And to add that molecule?

641
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,699
You have to break
the pseudoephedrine down,

642
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,657
then add methyl alcohol
and evaporate it

643
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:57,224
so that the oxygen can --

644
00:26:57,267 --> 00:26:59,400
Boom! Half your chemicals
just burned up.

645
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:01,054
Improvise. Where do you get
the methyl alcohol?

646
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:02,621
Um... Where?

647
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:05,449
Windshield washer fluid,

648
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:08,365
then fertilizer
with anhydrous ammonia.

649
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:10,585
Sodium metal or lithium metal.

650
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:11,891
You can get that from batteries.

651
00:27:14,807 --> 00:27:16,896
Yes, you can. Good.

652
00:27:16,939 --> 00:27:18,462
We're gonna spend
the afternoon cooking.

653
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:19,855
Knowing what to do is one thing.

654
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,640
Knowing what to do
when everything goes wrong --

655
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:22,902
That's what's gonna
keep you alive.

656
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:25,382
Alright. Show me what you got.

657
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:32,433
Where's your doorman?

658
00:27:32,476 --> 00:27:34,914
Running an errand.

659
00:27:38,178 --> 00:27:40,920
<i>Cafecito? You must have some.</i>

660
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:43,096
I have it shipped in daily
from my country.

661
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:45,751
We have the best in the world.

662
00:27:47,404 --> 00:27:49,493
Guatemalan style.

663
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:50,886
Very sweet.

664
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,235
But don't worry --

665
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:54,237
the beans
are called Huehuetenango.

666
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:56,587
Low on acid. Easy on the tummy.

667
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,154
Your baby won't mind.

668
00:27:58,198 --> 00:28:00,548
Now, you have something
for me, no?

669
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:03,682
There's a condition.

670
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,248
The war stops today.

671
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:07,076
You declare
an immediate cease-fire

672
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,296
and a guaranteed protection
of Cesar Madrigal.

673
00:28:09,339 --> 00:28:11,515
You ask a lot
of grieving mother.

674
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:13,169
You chose this line of work.

675
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:14,910
This is the price
of doing business.

676
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:18,566
Say it.

677
00:28:19,959 --> 00:28:23,049
No harm will come
to Cesar Madrigal.

678
00:28:23,092 --> 00:28:24,746
You have my word.

679
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:43,286
The <i>Federales</i> put a Trojan horse
in here, yes?

680
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,159
Brand new and air-gapped

681
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:47,682
so it can't connect
to your network.

682
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,901
Of course.

683
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,686
You watch us, <i> hermana.</i>

684
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,340
We watch you.

685
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:55,690
Tell the DEA
better luck next time.

686
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:00,434
<i>Gueros</i> like that always
underestimate <i>chicas</i> like us.

687
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:17,190
Control, be advised,
Cesar is on the move.

688
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:18,452
Have the nearest unit
pick up the tail.

689
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:20,367
We're gonna question
the girlfriend.

690
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,980
Tomá <i>My son --
He's foolhardy and rash,</i>

691
00:29:25,024 --> 00:29:27,156
<i>but he's still my blood.</i>

692
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,897
<i>Cesar will be provided for.</i>

693
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:30,725
<i>You have my word.</i>

694
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,336
<i>Then you, Ms. De la Cruz --</i>

695
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,383
<i>I want you
to continue my legacy.</i>

696
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:42,215
And just like that,
there is peace in Los Angeles.

697
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:43,825
<i>Felicidades,</i> Angela.

698
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:45,609
<i>Cafecito</i> is good, <i> verdad?</i>

699
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:47,524
<i>Quesadilla de Arroz?</i>

700
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:49,744
My <i>abuelita's is better.</i>

701
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,180
You want the recipe? No.

702
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:52,616
Stop acting like we're friends.

703
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,096
For the moment,
our interests align,

704
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,750
and it'll stay that way

705
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,840
if the violence stops
and Cesar stays alive.

706
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:01,147
I told you.

707
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,889
Killing Cesar
would be unsatisfying.

708
00:30:05,412 --> 00:30:07,762
He must suffer like I suffer.

709
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,984
Can I use your bathroom?

710
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:14,856
This baby's bouncing
on my bladder like a trampoline.

711
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,471
Police, open up.

712
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:24,170
We have some questions for you
regarding Cesar Madrigal.

713
00:30:24,213 --> 00:30:26,041
- Don't know him.
- That's weird.

714
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:27,608
We just saw him leave.
May we come in?

715
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:30,002
I'm calling my lawyer.

716
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:31,351
Good. You really should.

717
00:30:31,394 --> 00:30:33,396
We're in the process
of getting a warrant.

718
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:38,184
Look, it's criminal 101

719
00:30:38,227 --> 00:30:40,447
for suspects
to hide illicit items

720
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,796
in their girlfriends' homes.

721
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,754
Cash, contraband, you name it.

722
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:46,148
That gets you arrested.
That gets you put in prison.

723
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:48,759
That gets your baby
put in foster care.

724
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:51,501
That is not the outcome
we're hoping for.

725
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,155
So, let's sit down,

726
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:55,854
have a talk about this
taking a different path.

727
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,987
Hey.

728
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,641
<i>I think Cesar
might have a kid somewhere,</i>

729
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:02,730
<i>and La Fiera's
going to kill him.</i>

730
00:31:02,773 --> 00:31:04,210
Yeah,
a little ahead of you, there.

731
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:06,168
Do me a favor --
call in back-up. Code 3 high.

732
00:31:06,212 --> 00:31:09,606
5917 Sycamore Court.
Five shooters on site.

733
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,173
You have a cast-iron tub
-in your home?
-Yes, upstairs.

734
00:31:11,217 --> 00:31:12,827
Get your baby.
Get inside. Lock the door.

735
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:13,393
Hide in the tub.
It's bulletproof.

736
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:17,527
Call it off.

737
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:20,182
Murdering Cesar's baby
is twisted, even for you.

738
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:21,662
I don't know
what you're talking about.

739
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:24,447
But if Cesar's child
were to die,

740
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:27,059
well, that's just karma
balancing the scales.

741
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,712
It doesn't bother you?

742
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:30,627
Making another mother
grieve the way you do?

743
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,107
Like I said --

744
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:35,328
I cannot stop
what I did not order.

745
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:37,112
What's the plan?

746
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:40,159
They came here expecting to find
a helpless woman and child.

747
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:42,683
Let's show them how steep
the price of admission is.

748
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:47,253
Galeno, right?
You work with La Fiera.

749
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:49,211
I met you at the hospital
last week, remember?

750
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,734
You were dressed different.

751
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:52,432
Yeah, I was in uniform.

752
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:53,912
Easy, gentlemen.

753
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:55,870
If I see a weapon,

754
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,524
we're gonna have a real problem.

755
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:00,657
Look, I appreciate the position
that you're in, officers,

756
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,181
but you need
to try to understand mine.

757
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:03,486
We have a job to do,

758
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,314
and the price of failure
is death.

759
00:32:05,358 --> 00:32:08,143
So there is nothing
for us to lose.

760
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:11,016
You, on the other hand --
you have options.

761
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,974
I think
he wants us to walk away.

762
00:32:13,018 --> 00:32:14,367
- How much?
- How much do you want?

763
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,195
Oh, I want to be Batman rich.

764
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:17,805
What's that take?
Like, a billion?
Way more.

765
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:19,502
Yeah, like 10 or 20.
Since I don't think you have

766
00:32:19,546 --> 00:32:21,200
that kind of cash on you,
it looks like

767
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:22,853
we're sticking around
and I don't get to be Batman.

768
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:24,768
Then I guess we're done talking.

769
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:26,509
Rgh!

770
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,558
Ow.

771
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:40,654
Fall back upstairs?

772
00:32:40,697 --> 00:32:42,090
Negative. They'll just
light the house on fire

773
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:43,657
and shoot us when we come out.

774
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,311
Our only option
is to take the fight to them.

775
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:46,834
Well, it looks like
we're done talking, too.

You know what they taught
us at the Academy about
fighting a guy with a knife?

790
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,585
- No, tell me.
- Says if you hold it
the wrong way,

791
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:44,022
you got a chance.

792
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,415
If they hold it
the right way, run.

793
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:49,070
How am I holding it?

794
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,072
The right way.

795
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:54,510
You gonna run? No.

796
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,521
That the best you got?

797
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:24,453
- First knife fight?
- Yeah.

798
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:25,541
He hold it the right way?

799
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:27,108
Yeah.

800
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,894
Control, 7-Adam-19.

801
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:33,158
Five in custody. Code 4.

802
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:38,598
Stella?

803
00:34:38,641 --> 00:34:40,121
Wade. Come on in.

804
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:41,166
Appreciate you taking the time.

805
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,820
This is Officer Jackson West.

806
00:34:43,864 --> 00:34:46,040
Pleasure to meet you,
ma'am.
You, too.

807
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,302
But, listen, I read the report

808
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:49,652
on your attack
in Doug Stanton's file.

809
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:51,132
It's unconscionable,

810
00:34:51,176 --> 00:34:53,091
but your Sergeant here
knows as well as I do

811
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:54,962
that when an officer
is reinstated by the Department,

812
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,137
there's literally nothing

813
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,747
their Watch Commander
can do about it.

814
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,967
With all due respect, ma'am,

815
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,752
that's, uh -- that's not true.

816
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:04,667
Stella, we go way back.

817
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:06,495
You know firsthand
how hard it is

818
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:09,237
to make meaningful changes
inside the Department.

819
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:11,892
So all I'm asking is
that you hear Officer West out.

820
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,376
Alright.

821
00:35:17,419 --> 00:35:19,639
You have my attention.

822
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:23,382
As you all know,
I have instituted

823
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:26,211
new training protocols
with the goal of moving us

824
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:28,474
towards a more modern approach
on policing.

825
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,258
We're gonna watch and discuss
a new training video

826
00:35:30,302 --> 00:35:32,434
about ensuring
your partner's safety.

827
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:36,221
<i>Control, 7-Adam-7.
A to B. I'm out with three.</i>

828
00:35:36,264 --> 00:35:38,048
<i>Copy,
right behind you.
Stop where you are.</i>

829
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:39,702
<i>Look, you guys
do not want to do this.</i>

830
00:35:39,746 --> 00:35:40,399
<i>Look -- Stop where you are!

831
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:42,357
<i>Hey! Oh!</i>

832
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:55,153
Whoa!
- Officer #
Is that Stanton?

833
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,763
Officer # That's Stanton.

834
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:58,199
<i>He's still breathing.
He's still breathing.</i>

835
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,810
<i>7-Adam-19, we need
an ambulance to our location.</i>

836
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,813
<i>Officer down, 24-year-old male,</i>

837
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:04,597
<i>full body trauma.</i>

838
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,598
<i>What happened, partner?</i>

839
00:36:05,641 --> 00:36:06,599
<i>Who did this to you?</i>

840
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,300
This is not
-what it looks like.
-Yes, it is.

841
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:14,607
This is the truth
about Doug Stanton --

842
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:16,435
what kind of cop he is.

843
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:19,568
One who won't have your back
when you need it the most.

844
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:20,917
Come on, guys.

845
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:22,963
Come on, you -- you know me.

846
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:24,225
They do now.

847
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,665
Hey, Lucy.

848
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:33,234
So, I just got off the phone
with Shea.

849
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:34,496
You rocked the cook.

850
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,237
He said
you're more knowledgeable

851
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:37,412
than half the guys
that work for him.

852
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:40,589
What? Wow.
So, what does that mean?

853
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,112
Well, I spoke to Grey,

854
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:43,897
and I told him you are
as ready as you could be,

855
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,246
considering the circumstances,

856
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,292
and he approved the operation.

857
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:50,251
There is no telling

858
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,297
how long you will be
off the grid,

859
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,560
so you need to get your
personal life squared away.

860
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:56,257
Yes, ma'am.

861
00:36:56,301 --> 00:36:57,476
This assignment,
it will be hard.

862
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:58,955
It will be lonely,

863
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:01,131
and at times,
it might even be boring.

864
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:04,961
But you can never
let your guard down.

865
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:08,356
If you do, you are dead.

866
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,750
- You got it?
- Yes.

867
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:13,013
Alright. Go home.

868
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:15,276
The real work starts tomorrow.

869
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:22,370
♪ Come with us, don't stay

870
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:26,069
♪ In the midst of your mind...

871
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:28,376
Paperwork on this one
is gonna take forever.

872
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,812
I was gonna order some food.

873
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:31,379
How about Thai?

874
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:33,251
You're a good cop, Nolan.

875
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:34,774
I'll grant you that.

876
00:37:34,817 --> 00:37:37,037
Thank you, sir.

877
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,083
I appreciate it.
Is that a yes to Thai?

878
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:45,088
How serious are you about
becoming a training officer?

879
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:46,481
Very serious.

880
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:48,048
Training our next generation

881
00:37:48,091 --> 00:37:50,180
is the most sacred position
an officer can hold.

882
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:51,791
It's not a consolation prize

883
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,488
or a rung on the ladder
to your next promotion.

884
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:55,185
I know that.
No,
I don't think you do.

885
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:57,100
Because last month,
you wanted to be a detective.

886
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:58,058
Then you found out
that couldn't happen,

887
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:00,016
and now you want to be a T.O.

888
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,977
Sir, I don't <i>want to be a T.O.</i>

889
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,588
I'm <i>going to</i> be a T.O.

890
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:09,112
If you want to doubt
my convictions,

891
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:10,723
that's fine.

892
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:12,202
You don't want to help me?
That's fine, too.

893
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:16,032
But you're not
going to deter me.

894
00:38:16,076 --> 00:38:18,296
♪ ...or feel

895
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,648
Let's get Mexican. Love it.

896
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:28,044
♪ ...beyond the pale

897
00:38:28,088 --> 00:38:29,611
Hey.

898
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,439
I left messages for you.

899
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:32,962
Lying in wait for
the pregnant woman to walk out?

900
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:34,442
Way to be creepy.

901
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:35,835
How'd it go?

902
00:38:35,878 --> 00:38:38,054
La Fiera saw
right through your play.

903
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:40,492
Made an audio recording
and ditched the thumb drive.

904
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:41,841
That's my fault.

905
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:43,059
Shouldn't have sent in a novice.

906
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:48,456
When you look at her,
all you see

907
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,892
is a woman
from a third-world country

908
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:52,025
with a fourth-grade education.

909
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:53,896
But she's smarter than you.

910
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,898
Oh, really? But not you?

911
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:57,291
No, she probably is.

912
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,641
But I'm humble enough
to know that,

913
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:02,949
which is why I'm going to be
the one who takes her down.

914
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:17,964
No! No!

915
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,058
No!

916
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:39,420
You screwed up
betraying Mr. Salonga like that.

917
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:41,727
I don't know
what you're talking about.

918
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,293
We grabbed up your friend Coco.

919
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:44,860
It took a little cutting,

920
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:46,471
but she told us
that she was a cop --

921
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:47,385
that you were all cops.

922
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,908
You're lying.

923
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:51,563
Coco would never say that,
because it's not true.

924
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,786
W-Wait, wait.

925
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,659
No! No! No!

926
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:07,361
Look, I'm not asking you.

927
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,667
I already know.

928
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,146
My question is,

929
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:13,454
what else do the cops know
about Mr. Salonga's operation?

930
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:15,717
We have certain
upcoming transactions.

931
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,719
I need to know
if they've been compromised.

932
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:19,721
I have no idea.

933
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:29,296
Last chance.

934
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:35,694
Listen to me.

935
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:39,698
Whatever Coco said to you,
she's lying.

936
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:42,222
That's what people do
when they're being tortured.

937
00:40:42,265 --> 00:40:44,267
She would have admitted
to being an elephant

938
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:46,269
if you had asked her.

939
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:47,880
You set that fire,

940
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:50,404
and Salonga is as good as dead.

941
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:52,928
Word on the street is

942
00:40:52,972 --> 00:40:55,409
he's in debt
to some really bad people,

943
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,151
and I am the only one
who can get him out of it

944
00:40:58,194 --> 00:41:00,196
by cooking him up a fortune.

945
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,505
But I am not gonna do that
if you hurt her.

946
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:09,684
So pull your head
out of your ass and let us go.

947
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,955
She's pretty good.

948
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:23,524
Of course she is.

949
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:26,048
I taught her
everything she knows.

950
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:28,703
Pass me a towel? Wow!

951
00:41:28,747 --> 00:41:31,053
You're a full-service asshat!

952
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:32,533
You'll thank me for it later.

953
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:33,926
And you!

954
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:35,623
You abducted me

955
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,930
when you know
what I have been through!

956
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:39,888
That is exactly why I did it.

957
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:42,238
And if you're looking
for an apology,

958
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:43,631
you're not gonna get it.

959
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:45,807
I needed to see
how you would react.

960
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:48,680
And honestly, <i>you</i> needed to see
how you would react.

961
00:41:50,203 --> 00:41:51,813
That was your last test. Really?

962
00:41:51,857 --> 00:41:54,555
'Cause that's what you said
after the <i>last</i> last test.

963
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:55,817
Which is why you didn't
see this one coming.

964
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:58,907
Look at me.

965
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,520
This is your final chance
to back out.

966
00:42:02,563 --> 00:42:06,524
Do you still want this
after what you just experienced?

967
00:42:13,182 --> 00:42:14,444
Yeah.

968
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:19,145
Yeah, I do.
