1
00:00:01,523 --> 00:00:03,046
Check. Check. Is it good?

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,309
Okay. Thanks.

3
00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:07,398
I don't want to knock the light.

4
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:10,967
-This here good? That's great.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,360
Alright.

6
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:14,275
Uh, when my son Henry was born,

7
00:00:14,318 --> 00:00:16,407
he had a, uh, heart condition --

8
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:18,235
uh, Tetralogy of Fallot.

9
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,456
Um, it's actually a combination
of four heart defects

10
00:00:21,499 --> 00:00:24,198
that are, uh, fatal, uh,
without surgery.

11
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:25,895
Multiple surgeries.

12
00:00:25,938 --> 00:00:30,030
And... to watch your child
go through that,

13
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:33,076
it was... a tough time.

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,646
But one thing
that always cheered my family up

15
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:38,690
was the show "Paul's Place."

16
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:48,526
Mmm! Tastes good!

17
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:52,313
The star of the show,
the boy who played Paul,

18
00:00:52,356 --> 00:00:53,488
was Corey Harris.

19
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:55,577
He was so funny.

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,448
Henry would do
the milkshake thing,

21
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:58,623
you know,
pretending to be Corey.

22
00:00:58,667 --> 00:00:59,972
"Mmm! Tastes so good!"

23
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:02,497
And he would make such a mess,
but...

24
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,064
how could you be mad?

25
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:07,154
I always said to myself
if I ever met him,

26
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:08,764
I would thank him.

27
00:01:08,807 --> 00:01:10,070
You know, just shake his hand.

28
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,857
That was before I found out
what he'd become.

29
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,468
I am the Prophet Jedediah.

30
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,818
And tomorrow, the 3rd of June,

31
00:01:19,862 --> 00:01:22,865
is the day that we, the Worthy,
shall ascend.

32
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:24,127
The time for questions is done.

33
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:25,172
...get the hell out of my class
right now!

34
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:26,347
...drugs, alcohol...

35
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,522
I'm scared! I don't want to die!

36
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:29,306
Aah!

37
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,352
I just couldn't believe
what happened

38
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:35,138
to that sweet kid that my son
looked up to, you know?

39
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,227
I couldn't believe
that I was there for all of it.

40
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:52,503
Sorry.
I'm just a little nervous.

41
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,244
That's -- I'm assuming
that's normal, yeah?

42
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:55,637
Oh, totally.
- But there's no pressure.

43
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,552
We're just talking. Okay.

44
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:59,031
Uh, where --
where should I start?

45
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,250
Tell me about June 3rd.

46
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:02,861
Yeah. It started off
like any other day.

47
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:04,863
A few mundane calls.

48
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:07,692
And then the world went crazy.

49
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:10,565
Los Angeles was thrown
into chaos today

50
00:02:10,608 --> 00:02:13,133
when the Emergency Alert System
inadvertently sent out

51
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:14,917
a text message stating

52
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,876
a nuclear missile
was headed for the city.

53
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,748
It felt like
the end of the world.

54
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,358
We helped as many people
as we could

55
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,969
and then headed for shelter.

56
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:26,537
That's when we saw them,
standing on the ledge,

57
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:30,062
20 stories up,
waiting for their...

58
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:31,107
How do I put it?

59
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,979
Their ride, uh, from the aliens.

60
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:38,419
Turned out there was this dude
named the Prophet Jedediah

61
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:41,204
who told them that on June 3rd,

62
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:44,425
E.T. was coming
to embrace his followers

63
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:46,818
during their... ascension.

64
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:49,081
All hail Children of the Stars.

65
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,648
And for the first time
in history, a cult leader

66
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,781
actually guessed the right date
for the apocalypse.

67
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:55,131
Turns out this prophet
had been predicting for years

68
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,221
that June 3, 2019, would be
the date for their ascension.

69
00:02:58,265 --> 00:02:59,440
And it was just dumb luck

70
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:01,485
that the missile alert happened
that day.

71
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:03,270
I mean, these people
were so brainwashed

72
00:03:03,313 --> 00:03:04,967
that they were gonna jump
to their death.

73
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,535
Thank God
that Officer Lopez was there.

74
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:09,928
I mean, she saved
all of their lives.

75
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:11,539
You got to understand,
we had no idea

76
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:14,019
who this Prophet Jedediah was.

77
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:16,196
And in the crazy days
that followed,

78
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,720
he kind of fell
through the cracks.

79
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:22,027
Not that it would've made
any difference if...

80
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:24,160
Well, at least I don't think
it would've.

81
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,857
<i>7-Adam-15, possible 207,</i>

82
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,424
<i>9901 Violet Drive.</i>

83
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:28,773
<i>RP is on scene.</i>

84
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,297
...my daughter out here!

85
00:03:31,385 --> 00:03:33,169
Oh, good. The cops.

86
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,910
Debbie!

87
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:37,260
Look, my daughter
is inside this house.

88
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:38,870
He's keeping her.

89
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,220
He won't let her leave.

90
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,786
He's brainwashing her.

91
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,961
Good morning, Officers.
I'm so sorry

92
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,136
you had to be bothered
with this.

93
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,747
I know you. You're Corey Harris.

94
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,661
You're from that, uh...

95
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:47,618
"Paul's Place."

96
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:49,664
Yeah. That was a lifetime ago,

97
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,492
but it's always nice
to meet a fan.

98
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:52,232
You want an autograph?

99
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,277
It threw me.

100
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:56,932
Uh, the thing about celebrities
is I think

101
00:03:56,975 --> 00:04:00,065
they get locked in time
in your head, you know?

102
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,067
Whatever that show is
you loved them from,

103
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,896
that's the way
you always expect them to be.

104
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,202
Corey Harris had done
some other shows

105
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,943
since "Paul's Place"
but nothing that stuck.

106
00:04:07,986 --> 00:04:09,640
You know, people called him
a child star,

107
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:10,859
as if that was
some kind of failing.

108
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:12,774
But even so, I, um --

109
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:14,384
I was definitely
a little starstruck.

110
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:17,692
I mean, it didn't really matter
to me that he was famous.

111
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:19,346
I mean, this is L.A.

112
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:22,740
Every other house is owned
by a superstar or a model

113
00:04:22,784 --> 00:04:24,829
or... cult leader.

114
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:26,570
Will you arrest him?

115
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,616
He's keeping my daughter
against her will.

116
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,357
He -- He's a cult leader!

117
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,054
It's not a cult.

118
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:35,318
It's a religious movement --
awaiting tax-exempt status.

119
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:36,580
Aurora is over 18
and here of her own volition.

120
00:04:36,624 --> 00:04:38,321
Her name is Debbie.

121
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:40,584
Aurora has shed her birth name,

122
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:42,630
like a moth
becoming a butterfly.

123
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,371
Caterpillar.

124
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:45,763
Moths don't become butterflies.

125
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,722
Uh, can we speak
to Debbie, please?

126
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:48,940
Of course.

127
00:04:48,984 --> 00:04:50,333
Aurora!

128
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,337
Yes, Prophet?

129
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,469
Can you tell these nice officers

130
00:04:55,512 --> 00:04:56,731
that you're here
of your own free will?

131
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:58,907
I'm here of my own free will.

132
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,256
Oh, that was convincing.

133
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,171
Debbie, please. This is crazy.

134
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:03,390
You got to come home.

135
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,392
I <i>am</i> home.

136
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:07,089
- You got to stop her.
- Why don't you wait inside
while we talk to Debbie?

137
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:08,743
I can't, sir. She's an adult.

138
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:09,918
Only if that's what
Aurora wants.

139
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,049
I have nothing else to say.

140
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:11,963
I'm happy here,
with my real family.

141
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,225
But, D-Debbie --

142
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:15,532
Debbie, your mother's cancer --
It's back!

143
00:05:15,576 --> 00:05:16,925
She's dying!

144
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,579
She's only got a couple weeks
to live!

145
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:23,323
She needs you.

146
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,759
Aurora?

147
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,377
It was like a switch flipped.

148
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,336
Aurora w-- Um, not Aurora.

149
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:38,773
Uh, Debbie went back inside,

150
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:40,165
and she packed all of her stuff

151
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,820
and then she left with her dad.

152
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:44,953
I guess she just needed
a cold, hard dose

153
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,433
of reality to bring her back.

154
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,130
You said earlier you wanted to thank Corey

155
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,393
for helping you and
your son, shake his hand.

156
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:52,003
- Did you?
- No. No.

157
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,745
It felt, um, super
inappropriate at the time.

158
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:56,791
So we just headed out,

159
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,314
and I thought
that was the end of it.

160
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,414
You the one who called?

161
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,677
Yes. I garden for Mr. Harris.

162
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,331
I found blood by the door.

163
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,550
Did you go in the home?

164
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:18,421
- No.
- Okay. Go wait over
by your truck.

165
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,075
We'll check it out and come back
and get your statement.

166
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:21,206
Thank you.

167
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,386
Police!

168
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:27,909
Mr. Harris, are you home?

169
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,432
Control, 7-Adam-19,
we've got blood

170
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:32,304
at 9901 Violet Drive.

171
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:33,697
We're gonna clear the house.

172
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,525
Notify supervisor,
request additional units.

173
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,445
Blood.

174
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:54,414
Tim.

175
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,289
We have major blood loss
at our location.

176
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:02,073
Send detectives and TID.

177
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,599
Is this gonna take long?

178
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,992
Because, uh, we got work to do.

179
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:09,472
Um... uh, what can you tell me

180
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,561
about the crime scene?

181
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,128
Well, I mean, that amount of blood,

182
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:15,826
if it came from one person,
then that's fatal.

183
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,349
Without Corey's body,
we had to treat it

184
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:19,700
as a missing-persons case
while the lab ran the blood

185
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:21,223
against Corey's DNA.

186
00:07:21,266 --> 00:07:22,398
But no one was home?

187
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,573
We didn't know that yet.

188
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:25,140
We hadn't cleared the house.

189
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:28,186
It -- Corey's disciples
were at a drum circle downtown.

190
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,624
They did it once a week
to recruit new followers.

191
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,842
Yeah. The house's
security camera

192
00:07:31,886 --> 00:07:33,191
captured them all leaving right before --

193
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:34,932
Oh, yeah.
We have a video of them

194
00:07:34,976 --> 00:07:36,281
downtown across from City Hall.

195
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:38,240
I'm sorry. I cut you off.
I'm sorry.

196
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:41,417
I was just gonna say
that the security system

197
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,767
was shut off right after they all left.

198
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:45,334
It took three hours to reboot.

199
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:48,685
So there's no video
of the crime.

200
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:49,773
This is fun.

201
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,079
What is this about?

202
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:52,297
Look, I need to be
at the hospital.

203
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,560
My wife doesn't have much time left.

204
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:54,952
We understand, sir.

205
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:56,867
Uh, you can take a seat, please.

206
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:58,956
We will try and make this quick.

207
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:03,439
Were you at the hospital
yesterday?

208
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,701
All day and night.

209
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,355
Was your daughter there
with you?

210
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:09,010
What do you think?

211
00:08:09,053 --> 00:08:12,927
She hasn't seen her dying mother
in years because of that man.

212
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:15,582
D-Do you understand the whiplash
that Debbie's experienced

213
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,889
in the last two days alone?

214
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:22,023
Seeing her mother again
has j-- opened her eyes

215
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,199
to everything that she has been
missing in the world --

216
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:25,548
all the love, all the joy

217
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:29,813
that Corey has withheld from her
all of this time.

218
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:32,642
Corey went missing yesterday.

219
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:36,472
There were signs of violence
at his house.

220
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,170
Good.

221
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:45,568
He destroyed our family,
destroyed Debbie's life.

222
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:51,879
It was just supposed to be
an acting class.

223
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:53,271
You think the most
important quality

224
00:08:53,315 --> 00:08:55,056
of a great actor is talent?

225
00:08:55,099 --> 00:08:56,623
Wrong!

226
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,016
It's the ability
to be mercenary,

227
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,931
to do whatever it takes
to get a part

228
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:04,108
and to use that role
to get the next one.

229
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,284
Trust me. I'm living proof
of what happens when you don't.

230
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,112
So when the acting jobs
dried up,

231
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:09,897
Corey started an acting school.

232
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,596
And he basically just used it
to air his grievances

233
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,989
about Hollywood...

234
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:16,599
After "Paul's Place,"
I just assumed

235
00:09:16,643 --> 00:09:18,427
that the starring roles would
keep coming, but they didn't.

236
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,169
...and to convince
these kids that, you know,

237
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:22,518
he was the only one
that could help them

238
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,042
navigate this evil world.

239
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:27,436
I'm not here
to teach you methods.

240
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,568
I'm here to teach you that
unless you're willing

241
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,787
to cross every line

242
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:32,833
and throw every inhibition
you have out the window,

243
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:35,400
then you should get the hell
out of my class right now!

244
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:40,144
But... if you stay,

245
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,538
I will help you.

246
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,627
I will nurture you.

247
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,847
I will give you a safe place
to become a star.

248
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,370
And these twenty-somethings,

249
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:49,850
they fell for it,

250
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:53,288
and they paid thousands
of dollars for these classes

251
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:56,508
that slowly just turned
into pseudo-religious

252
00:09:56,552 --> 00:09:58,598
character-building seminars.

253
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:00,034
He made them feel special.

254
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:01,688
You know, in a business
that makes people

255
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,951
feel like garbage
on a regular basis,

256
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:05,561
it wasn't long before Debbie
and the others

257
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,347
started treating him
like a... a guru.

258
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:11,915
You know, he literally told them
how to act,

259
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:14,526
and in their eyes,
he became infallible.

260
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,354
He could do no wrong.

261
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:18,792
He could commit acts
of unspeakable evil

262
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:21,011
yet still be their savior
from above.

263
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,405
I can't speak
to Officer Nolan's comments,

264
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,407
but what we discovered
at Corey's house that day

265
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:28,453
was pretty disturbing.

266
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:29,629
Tim.

267
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:33,154
Police!

268
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:34,285
Come out from under the bed.

269
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:35,722
Do it now.

270
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:37,245
Come out with your hands up.

271
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:48,299
Holy crap.

272
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:52,956
What is it?
- It's -- It's a --

273
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,654
A what?

274
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,525
A mummy.

275
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:57,482
In a suit.

276
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,267
What?

277
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,843
Is that...

278
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:10,713
It can't be.

279
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:11,975
It looks like, uh --

280
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:13,107
It was Charlie Chaplin.

281
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,369
Charlie Chaplin's mummy.

282
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:18,068
That was -- That was
Corey's greatest treasure.

283
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:20,244
And where exactly
did Corey obtain

284
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:24,074
this mummified body, Debbie?

285
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:25,772
He stole it.

286
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:26,816
<i>We</i> stole it.

287
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,730
From who?

288
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,732
From me. Yeah.

289
00:11:29,776 --> 00:11:31,865
No. I bought Charlie
at a secret auction

290
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:34,041
I found out about from Nic.

291
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,433
Cage.

292
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:37,697
I owe my entire career
to Charlie.

293
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,656
He is my total inspiration.

294
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,877
I mean, that -- that tramp.

295
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,662
Oh, my God. I wouldn't be
who I am today without him.

296
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,011
You know?

297
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:52,059
So when I found out
I could own him --

298
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:54,844
Like, "Rainn, do you want to --
you want to own Charlie?"

299
00:11:54,888 --> 00:11:56,585
It was like how could I say no?

300
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:57,934
You know what I mean?

301
00:11:57,978 --> 00:12:00,545
So when I found out
that I was robbed,

302
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:03,940
it's like I didn't care about my
vintage cowboy hat collection.

303
00:12:03,984 --> 00:12:05,463
You know what I mean?

304
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:07,422
I don't care
about my solid gold retainer

305
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:10,947
or Catherine the Great's
speculum,

306
00:12:10,991 --> 00:12:15,125
my SAG awards,
any of that stuff. No.

307
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:20,043
I care about... losing
my best friend.

308
00:12:20,087 --> 00:12:21,566
Charlie.

309
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,394
No. Of course
it wasn't Chaplin's body.

310
00:12:23,438 --> 00:12:25,570
So, apparently in the '70s,

311
00:12:25,614 --> 00:12:28,878
there was someone who actually
did steal his body,

312
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:30,793
and they held it for ransom,

313
00:12:30,837 --> 00:12:32,142
but eventually it was returned.

314
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:35,232
However, there are
conspiracy theories

315
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:39,323
that the real body was sold
on the black market.

316
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:42,587
So the mummy that we found
is just one of dozens

317
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:46,983
of fake Chaplins
floating around.

318
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:48,680
Celebrities are nuts.

319
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:49,899
How did you feel
when you learned

320
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:52,597
that Corey Harris
was behind the theft?

321
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:56,384
Listen. I choose to live
in a realm of total positivity.

322
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:59,169
I have nothing bad
to say about anyone,

323
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:02,259
even a vain, talentless
skid mark like Corey.

324
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:03,870
I've heard
that he targeted celebrities

325
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:05,697
he felt had wronged him
in some way.

326
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:07,221
Yeah. He -- He thought
the role of Backstrom

327
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:09,049
should've gone to him.

328
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:10,920
Anyway, so he sicced
his whole cult

329
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:13,314
of acting students on me.

330
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:16,143
And do you own
any other celebrity mummies?

331
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,797
No comment.

332
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,147
Before they became
a full-blown cult,

333
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,105
Corey turned his acting school
into a burglary ring

334
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,237
that targeted celebrities.

335
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:27,502
♪ Ready or not,
-I'mma come run up in your spot ♪

336
00:13:27,545 --> 00:13:28,677
♪ Like Kobe with every shot

337
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,896
♪ Cannot be stopped,
don't you go... ♪

338
00:13:29,939 --> 00:13:31,898
I caught a bunch of calls
back in 2018.

339
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,421
That was before I was
on the job.

340
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,640
We arrested a few people,
but no one would flip on Corey,

341
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,120
so he got away with it.

342
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:39,166
Yeah. Corey promised
his students everything --

343
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:40,428
money, fame.

344
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:41,821
But all he did
was insert himself

345
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:43,257
farther and farther
into their lives.

346
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,390
He made them think he could
control their destinies.

347
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:47,870
I don't know. Maybe it's because

348
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:50,046
he didn't have any control
over his own.

349
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,440
What's that saying?
Those who can't do teach?

350
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:56,270
You were literally my teacher.

351
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:59,403
What are you saying?

352
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:03,320
My love! When I thrust
you with this knife,

353
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:04,669
why didn't you cry?

354
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:05,932
I've never seen a man die.

355
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,411
No, no. No, no, no, no!

356
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:08,543
Enough. Stop. Stop.

357
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,153
G-Get up right now.

358
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:10,937
What is this?

359
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,330
It's a-a knife. No.

360
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:16,290
This is a vehicle for the actor's soul.

361
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,508
It must convey
all of your anger,

362
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:19,032
all of your emotion.

363
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:21,251
You just used this knife
to take a man's life,

364
00:14:21,295 --> 00:14:24,820
not chop onions in the back
of a fast-food restaurant.

365
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:27,954
You know what I see
when I look at you?

366
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,390
Hmm? I see an amateur,

367
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,913
a nobody going nowhere.

368
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,611
Charlotte. Charlotte, thank you.

369
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,311
Aurora.

370
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:42,403
What Charlotte means to say
is anyone can simply memorize

371
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:44,448
or recite lines onstage.

372
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,363
But only a few dare
to push themselves

373
00:14:46,407 --> 00:14:48,496
where their minds
won't allow them to go.

374
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,498
That's what makes a true actor.

375
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,195
I can help you get there.

376
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,154
What do you say?

377
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:55,285
Hey!

378
00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:57,026
Turn that off!

379
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,420
What did I tell you about
filming in my son's school?!

380
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:03,250
Corey was such a special boy.

381
00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:05,556
Everyone's best friend.

382
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,297
Well, he didn't have
too many friends,

383
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,343
come to think of it,
but that's because

384
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:13,086
he was so dedicated
to his craft.

385
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:15,653
He was a natural leading man,
even as a boy,

386
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:19,831
and I knew he could succeed
at whatever he chose in life.

387
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,921
And he and Charlotte together --

388
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,053
You couldn't ask
for a better duo.

389
00:15:24,097 --> 00:15:25,968
A better duo
to brainwash people.

390
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,839
Corey always made Charlotte
play the bad cop --

391
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,145
no pun intended.

392
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:30,973
So Corey could swoop in
and be the savior.

393
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:33,019
Together they would brainwash
a student

394
00:15:33,062 --> 00:15:34,977
to the point where they would do
anything to please him.

395
00:15:35,021 --> 00:15:37,501
Yeah. And that's when he would
induct them into his Bling Ring,

396
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:38,981
telling them
that the only way to get

397
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,678
into the mind of a criminal
was to become one.

398
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,506
He ruined people's lives.

399
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,465
Including someone you know.

400
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:45,509
What?

401
00:15:45,553 --> 00:15:46,336
It's up here on the right.

402
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:49,383
Oh. Can I help you?

403
00:15:49,426 --> 00:15:50,862
Sterling Freeman.

404
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,473
Is it true that you were
once a student

405
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:55,432
of notorious acting teacher
turned cult leader Corey Harris?

406
00:15:55,476 --> 00:15:57,695
- What? No.
- Okay. You can leave now,
thank y--

407
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,655
In fact, your real name
isn't Sterling Freeman, is it?

408
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,657
It's Skipper Young,
and you participated

409
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,920
in a ring
of celebrity burglaries in 2017

410
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,356
at the direction of Harris.

411
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,358
Okay. What the hell is he
talking about?

412
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,186
Your name is Skipper?

413
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,929
How the
bloody hell did you find me?

414
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,496
Whoa. Why are you talking
all British?

415
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:22,677
So, I have a-a bit of
a confession to make, Jackson.

416
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:29,075
I'm not really from Tampa.

417
00:16:29,118 --> 00:16:29,901
Get out. Get out!

418
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:36,821
Well, you have to understand
that when I first arrived

419
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:37,735
in L.A. six years ago,
I was a nobody.

420
00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,260
Just a weird kid from Melbourne.

421
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:43,306
I had never even been
to the States before.

422
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,441
But all I knew was
I wanted to be a star.

423
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,399
And tell us
how you first met Corey.

424
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,835
I knew who he was, of course.

425
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,794
"Paul's Place" was big
in Australia.

426
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:55,057
Corey was a real actor, and
so I just thought, "Why not?"

427
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:58,843
And I went to one class...
and he hooked me.

428
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,671
He believed nothing in
this business is given to you.

429
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:02,282
Whatever you want in life,
you have to take it.

430
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:03,674
He said the burglaries
would help us

431
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,763
internalize that mind-set.

432
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:09,637
Corey wanted to help us
learn to conquer our fears...

433
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,334
push our boundaries.

434
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:13,293
And do you still believe
in Corey's teachings?

435
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:15,382
No. No. Not at all.

436
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:18,080
Alright?

437
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:21,170
Well, we fell out
right before my arrest,

438
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:22,867
and that's when things
were getting really weird.

439
00:17:22,911 --> 00:17:25,479
You know, over time, you could
tell he was getting delusional,

440
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:27,350
talking about spirits,

441
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:29,526
calling us -- his students --
"the Worthy,"

442
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,920
calling himself a prophet.

443
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:34,836
Well, it got to a point where...

444
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:36,577
I told myself one last run
with the crew

445
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,449
and then I'd leave.

446
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:40,450
Then I got caught.

447
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:48,284
No, I was not aware
that my boyf--

448
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:50,156
Sterling --

449
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:52,158
Skipper was a felon.

450
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,985
Or Australian.

451
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:56,423
Yes, yes, I'm aware
that cops are not permitted

452
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,207
to fraternize with felons.

453
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,601
Y-- This is
an actual active matter,

454
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:02,864
and I have no further comment
at this time.

455
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:04,213
Officer West --I said I have
no further comment.

456
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:05,475
Thank you.

457
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,173
Officer West, come on back.

458
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,132
How could you not tell me?

459
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:11,612
Hey, I am still Sterling.

460
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:13,222
No, y-you're not Sterling!

461
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,094
You're Skipper Young
or whoever the hell that is!

462
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,443
No.

463
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,401
After I was caught, I served
four months' probation

464
00:18:18,445 --> 00:18:20,664
and I changed my name.

465
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,362
I'm different now.

466
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,844
Please.

467
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:32,328
That part of my life,
it's -- it's behind me.

468
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,159
Do you believe me?

469
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:41,250
I don't know.

470
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:42,469
Jackson.

471
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:50,172
Obviously, uh,
we knew that Sterl--

472
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:53,523
uh, Skipper had nothing to do
with it.

473
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,353
He was in Prague shooting
a movie when it happened.

474
00:18:57,397 --> 00:18:59,007
So we still had a mystery
on our hands --

475
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,792
a missing cult leader
and a bloody crime scene.

476
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:05,187
That was when we became aware
of Corey's connection

477
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:07,537
to someone who was
a lot more dangerous

478
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:09,148
than a bunch of wannabe actors.

479
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,543
The Southland Stalker
was a serial killer

480
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:16,938
that terrorized L.A. County
starting in the fall of 2010.

481
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,418
He had no type.

482
00:19:18,461 --> 00:19:21,116
He would hit single people,
couples,

483
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,727
uh, even had a rampage
in a hotel once.

484
00:19:23,771 --> 00:19:25,468
Murdered three people
that night.

485
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:27,296
But the Stalker got sloppy,

486
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,776
and one of his victims escaped,

487
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:30,125
went to a neighbor's home,

488
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,997
and Dan Marcie was caught
in the surrounding area.

489
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,129
There had always been rumors

490
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,479
that the Stalker
didn't work alone,

491
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:37,611
that he had an accomplice.

492
00:19:37,654 --> 00:19:39,874
But Marcie maintained in court

493
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:42,050
that he did it all by himself --

494
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:44,270
a performance
that we later learned

495
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:46,097
he had a little help with.

496
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:55,672
I met Corey in 2017
at one of his acting classes.

497
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:59,415
I was looking for ways
to up my game,

498
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:00,808
gain people's trust.

499
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:01,983
And why was that?

500
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:03,637
So it'd be easier
to get my victims

501
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,204
to come with me willingly.

502
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:10,992
You see, for people like me --

503
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:12,907
psychopaths --
there's a short circuit

504
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,343
in the part of the brain
that feels empathy.

505
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:16,345
At least that's
what the prison shrink tells me.

506
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:21,132
Without that part, it makes it
difficult to relate to people,

507
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:24,571
to convince them to trust you.

508
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,268
I got tired of bashing people
over the head,

509
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:28,270
dragging them to the car,
so I thought it'd be much easier

510
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:30,751
if I could just charm them in
myself.

511
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,492
So I asked Corey to help me.

512
00:20:32,535 --> 00:20:36,278
And did he teach you
how to fake empathy?

513
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:39,063
Oh, yeah.

514
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:43,198
It opened up a whole new realm
of possibilities for me...

515
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,808
victim-wise.

516
00:20:44,852 --> 00:20:45,983
There's a rumor
that Corey also helped you

517
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:47,637
prepare for your trial,

518
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:48,986
to better connect with the jury.

519
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,640
Yeah.

520
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:51,902
Yeah, that's true.

521
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:20,279
I had the jury eating
out of the palm of my hand.

522
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:24,152
But they still convicted you
of first-degree murder.

523
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:25,588
Yeah. Well, once they saw the
photos of her head in my fridge,

524
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,111
it was kind of over for me.

525
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:28,896
Dan Marcie was convicted
of murder

526
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:31,072
months before Corey
went missing.

527
00:21:31,115 --> 00:21:33,640
But even though he wasn't
a suspect in the disappearance,

528
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:36,730
his association with Corey
definitely made us

529
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:39,820
take a closer look at who else
was taking those acting classes.

530
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:42,126
And in the end,
it wasn't a student

531
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,172
that gave us a break in the case
that we needed.

532
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:46,348
It was Corey's old co-star
and fellow teacher,

533
00:21:46,392 --> 00:21:47,393
Charlotte Luster.

534
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,745
Well, no one had heard from her

535
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:53,050
since the day Corey
went missing,

536
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,791
and we were about
to find out why.

537
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,236
Been parked here a week,

538
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,761
and there's a really bad smell
coming from the trunk.

539
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:09,328
Would you mind stepping
away from the vehicle?

540
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,068
It belongs to a suspect
in a violent crime.

541
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,739
Corey Harris
and Charlotte Luster.

542
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,828
You played childhood
sweethearts for eight seasons

543
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,177
on "Paul's Place,"

544
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:36,572
and now I hear you've
become partners in real life.

545
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:39,227
You know, Robin, when you
grow up with someone on TV,

546
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,924
it just...

547
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:42,883
it bonds you. Mm.

548
00:22:42,926 --> 00:22:45,059
Charlotte was always
like family.

549
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:46,321
And when she and Corey
started dating,

550
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,455
I couldn't have been happier.

551
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:51,979
I treated her
like my own daughter.

552
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:55,069
And if I'm being frank,

553
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:56,853
she was the luckiest girl
in the world

554
00:22:56,897 --> 00:23:00,509
to be able to date my son.

555
00:23:00,553 --> 00:23:04,339
Corey, it's no secret that
you struggled after the show ended.

556
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,515
Drugs, alcohol, even an arrest

557
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,910
for indecent exposure at an Emmy party.

558
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:11,912
Oh, that was all
a misunderstanding.

559
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:14,567
But what is true is that when
"Paul's Place"  was canceled,

560
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,918
I was a --I was a mess, adrift.

561
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,181
It was Charlotte who brought me back.

562
00:23:20,224 --> 00:23:21,400
She saved me.

563
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:26,100
Breaking news --
Charlotte Luster,

564
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:29,625
the former child star known for
the '90s sitcom "Paul's Place,"

565
00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:31,714
has been missing since Sunday.

566
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:34,238
She is the prime suspect
in the bloody disappearance

567
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:36,153
of Corey Harris.

568
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:38,068
Even though we found
Charlotte's car at the airport,

569
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:39,374
we couldn't find
any recent records

570
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,897
of her boarding a flight at LAX.

571
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:42,203
Uh, Detective Harper and I
were dispatched

572
00:23:42,246 --> 00:23:44,553
to Charlotte's apartment
to begin a search,

573
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:46,599
try to find some indication
of where she might've gone.

574
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:48,122
And did you?
- No.

575
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:50,254
But we did find something
that shed some light.

576
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:51,168
What was that?

577
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:53,083
A screenplay.

578
00:23:53,127 --> 00:23:54,215
For a movie.

579
00:23:54,258 --> 00:23:55,825
It's L.A.
It's not the first time

580
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,348
I've found a script
at a crime scene.

581
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:58,654
I've only been on the job
for a year,

582
00:23:58,698 --> 00:24:00,482
and I've already found three.

583
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:02,136
Have either of you
ever written one?

584
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,964
God, no.

585
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:08,316
It was for a class.

586
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,318
It was the title
that caught everyone's eye --

587
00:24:10,361 --> 00:24:11,624
"The Worthy."...the Worthy...

588
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,539
...the Worthy......the Worthy.

589
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:14,496
Same as Corey's cult.

590
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,193
This script is...

591
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:17,760
...500 pages long.

592
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:20,807
So we assigned three
of our rookie officers

593
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,939
the task of reading it.

594
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:23,940
What did you think of it?

595
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:26,508
Look,
I'm no screenwriting expert,

596
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:29,990
but I thought
it was, uh... dense.

597
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:31,426
Convoluted.

598
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,167
The worst thing
I have ever read.

599
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,864
"Exterior, rooftop, day."

600
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:36,997
"Aurora, 19,

601
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,825
beautiful but doesn't know it,

602
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:40,783
speaks the prophecy aloud."

603
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:42,872
"Heed ye
the Noon Star Harvesters,

604
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,527
for they shall descend
from the heavens

605
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:47,921
so the Worthy can ascend."

606
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:50,401
"So sayeth
the Prophet Jedediah."

607
00:24:50,445 --> 00:24:52,621
"All hail Children
of the Stars."

608
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:54,971
All hail Children of the Stars.

609
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:56,320
Yep.

610
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:58,845
He based his freakin' cult
off a bad sci-fi script.

611
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:00,673
That Charlotte wrote with him.

612
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:03,893
I've been a film producer
for like 25 years, okay?

613
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:05,852
This is the strangest thing
I've ever seen.

614
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:08,550
Well, second strangest.

615
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:10,770
Anyway,
it was like five years ago,

616
00:25:10,813 --> 00:25:12,902
and I heard about this script
making the rounds.

617
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:16,123
And listen. It's not uncommon
for actors to, you know,

618
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,342
try their hand at writing
when the roles dry up, right?

619
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:20,823
And P.S.
- - everyone thinks they got the next "Rocky."

620
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:22,912
But a 500-page space opera
written

621
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:25,393
by two former child stars
raised a few eyebrows.

622
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:26,960
I took the meeting.

623
00:25:27,003 --> 00:25:30,398
I mean, out of morbid curiosity
more than anything, right?

624
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:33,923
It was... uncomfortable.

625
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,490
And Charlotte,

626
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,841
she seemed totally willing
to receive feedback, you know?

627
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:42,758
Corey, he just flatly refused
to make any cuts to the script.

628
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:45,718
I told them as politely
as I could.

629
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,720
"It's a pass."

630
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:48,982
And then what happened?

631
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:50,897
Well, then I forgot about it
for a long time.

632
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,421
And then things got weird.

633
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,379
Today, police rescued
five people

634
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:57,294
from a Mid-Wilshire rooftop.

635
00:25:57,338 --> 00:25:59,862
The group identified themselves
as members of "the Worthy"

636
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:02,735
and were preparing
to commit ritual suicide

637
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,606
based on the teachings
of their leader,

638
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,043
known simply
as the Prophet Jedediah.

639
00:26:07,087 --> 00:26:09,089
You want to know why Corey
wasn't on that rooftop

640
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,047
ready to jump
with the rest of his followers?

641
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:12,614
Because he was filming it.

642
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:14,616
The day after the missile alert,

643
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,965
I get an e-mail from Corey.

644
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:19,708
The subject line --
"Proof of Concept."

645
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:22,015
I... I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

646
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:24,887
Five people almost died

647
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,280
because some washed-up narcissist

648
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:27,760
thought that the world
he dreamed up

649
00:26:27,803 --> 00:26:29,631
in his screenplay
had become real.

650
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,415
Along with the video,
Corey also sent Sheila

651
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:32,721
a revised version of his script.

652
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:34,593
Yeah. W-With Charlotte Luster's
name removed.

653
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:35,855
He was trying to cut her out --

654
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:37,639
from the script, the cult,
and the money.

655
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:21,901
Hell hath no fury
like a woman scorned, right?

656
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:23,293
Cool.

657
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:25,948
Way to trivialize female anger.

658
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:27,863
Hey, I'm not trivializing.

659
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:29,169
All sorts of crimes
are motivated

660
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:30,431
by jealous ex-partners.

661
00:27:30,474 --> 00:27:32,563
And how many of
those ex-partners are men?

662
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:36,567
Most.

663
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:37,525
I heard it was Officer Chen

664
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:38,918
who broke the case wide open.

665
00:27:38,961 --> 00:27:40,615
I d-- I don't know

666
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,399
if I'd describe it
quite that way.

667
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:45,751
How <i>would</i> you describe it, then?

668
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:49,276
Her addiction to social media
finally paid off.

669
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,278
T-That is hurtful.

670
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:52,888
I...

671
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:54,716
Can you tell us what happened?

672
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,198
I was on my phone,
doing... research

673
00:27:58,241 --> 00:28:00,026
- when I got a notification.
- Ah.

674
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:01,070
And -- You know what?

675
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:02,506
I-I still have the video
on my phone.

676
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:04,683
Just let me...

677
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:05,509
Look at that.

678
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,557
That's -- Uh, that's -- Sorry.

679
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,341
That's not what -- No.

680
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:13,779
You are never gonna believe

681
00:28:13,822 --> 00:28:15,650
the celeb sighting I just made

682
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,261
during my Malibu silent retreat.

683
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:20,307
That's Corey Harris.

684
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,700
He was alive.

685
00:28:26,792 --> 00:28:29,185
You have the right
to remain silent.

686
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:31,840
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

687
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:33,929
You have the right
to an attorney.

688
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:38,368
If you cannot afford one,
one will be provided for you.

689
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:40,066
Do you understand?

690
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:44,592
Do you understand, sir?

691
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,422
Corey?

692
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:51,599
Uh, he took the "right to remain
silent" part real seriously.

693
00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:53,166
Very seriously.

694
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,056
How long did he stay quiet?

695
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,623
Five and a half hours.

696
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:27,896
Wow.

697
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,464
That was invigorating.

698
00:29:30,507 --> 00:29:31,770
72 hours of silence.

699
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,120
You guys should try it.

700
00:29:34,163 --> 00:29:35,338
Now, what'd you want to ask me?

701
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:37,340
What a putz.

702
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:40,953
So, Corey, while you were, uh,
playing your little quiet game,

703
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:42,781
we were getting
the forensics report

704
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,521
back from the lab.

705
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:46,610
Do you care to guess
what it said?

706
00:29:46,654 --> 00:29:48,134
That I'm innocent.

707
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:50,701
No. That the blood that we found
at your house

708
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:53,139
and in Charlotte's car
belong to the same person.

709
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:54,140
Who?

710
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:55,750
Charlotte.

711
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:59,449
Oh, my God!

712
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:01,800
That's horrible!
My -- My poor girl.

713
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:05,455
Wow. You're right.
He <i>is</i> a good actor.

714
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:06,413
I told you. Mm-hmm.

715
00:30:06,456 --> 00:30:08,371
So what happened to Charlotte?

716
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:10,243
I have no idea.

717
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:12,201
I haven't seen her in weeks.

718
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,681
And I've been at the silent
retreat since last Monday.

719
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:15,291
I-I'm sure they have a record.

720
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:16,902
Yeah. An employee
recalls checking you in

721
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:18,947
at 10:00 a.m. Sunday morning.

722
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:20,731
Unfortunately, no one else
remembers seeing you

723
00:30:20,775 --> 00:30:22,821
until the welcome bonfire
that evening.

724
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:26,041
That leaves an eight-hour window
that is unaccounted for --

725
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:28,130
plenty of time for you
to leave the retreat,

726
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:31,960
go back home,
and kill Charlotte.

727
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:34,615
Do you have any proof of that?

728
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:38,967
Of course not,
because I didn't do it.

729
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:40,882
I could never hurt
another person.

730
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:42,666
What about your followers,

731
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,756
the ones you almost persuaded
to jump off a roof for you?

732
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,454
For me?

733
00:30:47,497 --> 00:30:49,325
They were doing it
for themselves,

734
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:51,197
for their own enlightenment,

735
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,982
so they could ascend
into a higher state of being.

736
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:58,465
I wouldn't expect someone
as limited as you to understand.

737
00:30:58,508 --> 00:30:59,858
Is that what you call the people

738
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,642
who can see through
your little act?

739
00:31:01,685 --> 00:31:04,906
Was -- Was Charlotte limited?

740
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,299
In some ways, yes.

741
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:08,562
Is that why you killed her?

742
00:31:08,605 --> 00:31:10,869
I think I need a lawyer.

743
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:13,393
Because she saw the real you.

744
00:31:13,436 --> 00:31:14,960
Because she had the power

745
00:31:15,003 --> 00:31:16,265
to send your house of cards
toppling.

746
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,095
Lawyer.

747
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:21,357
I can't talk about clients.

748
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:22,881
I told you that
when you called yesterday.

749
00:31:22,924 --> 00:31:24,795
-Even given what happened?

750
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,014
Yeah.

751
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:27,146
Corey built his whole empire

752
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,756
on a script he stole from Charlotte,

753
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,975
and she was gonna expose him.

754
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,541
That sounds like motive
for murder to me.

755
00:31:31,585 --> 00:31:32,673
Hey, speculate all you like.

756
00:31:32,716 --> 00:31:34,109
There was never any evidence.

757
00:31:34,153 --> 00:31:35,110
There was video.

758
00:31:35,154 --> 00:31:36,938
Which did not show my client.

759
00:31:36,982 --> 00:31:38,157
Now leave me alone.

760
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:05,967
Enter the "momager."

761
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:07,534
Mom and manager.

762
00:32:07,577 --> 00:32:09,884
It's all a hybrid.

763
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,190
I thought that was clever.

764
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:12,843
Anyway, once we saw the footage

765
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:14,584
of her tampering
with the evidence,

766
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:16,238
it was clear to us
that Laurie Harris played

767
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:19,894
at least some small
or, shall we say,

768
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,941
behind-the-scenes role
in the crime.

769
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:24,029
I don't get it.

770
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:25,944
I'm not gonna make
any more jokes.

771
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,858
So, Mrs. Harris,
what happened to Charlotte?

772
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:29,730
Last I heard,
she was flying to Cabo.

773
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:34,561
So... soakin' up the sun,
sippin' on margaritas?

774
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:37,738
Charlotte is not in Cabo,
Mrs. Harris.

775
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,827
Was it Cancun?

776
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,133
You drove her car
to the airport,

777
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:42,525
and then you left it there
to make it look like

778
00:32:42,569 --> 00:32:44,049
she had left town.

779
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,050
Oh.

780
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:46,573
That?

781
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:48,357
She asked me
to leave her car there.

782
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:50,751
Really? That's weird,
because we found her blood

783
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:52,579
at your son's house

784
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:55,843
and then also in the trunk
of her car.

785
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:58,977
And we also just found
what remains of her body

786
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,587
dumped heartlessly

787
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,199
20 miles up Interstate 5.

788
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:05,809
T-- My God.

789
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:10,814
That's... awful!

790
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:14,470
Poor Charlotte.

791
00:33:14,514 --> 00:33:17,082
Clearly, Corey
did not get his acting talents

792
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,213
from his mother.

793
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:20,737
Seriously.
That wasn't even believable.

794
00:33:20,781 --> 00:33:24,089
But you have bigger problems
than your lack of acting chops.

795
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:26,743
Charlotte's car
had GPS tracking.

796
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:30,182
You should've disabled it
before you dumped her body.

797
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:32,880
You can't prove I was anywhere <i>
but</i> the airport.

798
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:34,316
Did you kill her, Mrs. Harris,

799
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,752
or were you just cleaning up

800
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:37,406
another one
of your son's messes?

801
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,452
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

802
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:41,845
I think Corey checked in
at the retreat

803
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,760
and then he left
to go meet Charlotte.

804
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:46,676
He killed her and called you
to clean it up.

805
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,505
Then he went back
to his silent meditation

806
00:33:49,549 --> 00:33:51,725
while you dumped the body
of a woman you'd known

807
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:55,250
since she was a child
like so much trash.

808
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:03,737
Corey had nothing to do with it.

809
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,565
Are you sure?

810
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,958
Yeah.

811
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:11,701
I killed her all by myself.

812
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:20,362
Can you blame her
for trying to protect her son?

813
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:21,798
Uh, yeah.

814
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:23,104
She killed somebody.

815
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:25,541
Sure. But if your son
had done something

816
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:26,934
that would destroy his life,

817
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:28,283
wouldn't you try
and protect him,

818
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:29,806
throw yourself on the grenade?

819
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:37,118
Your job as a parent
is to protect your children

820
00:34:37,162 --> 00:34:39,207
as much as you can.

821
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:42,602
But that also means
teaching them right from wrong.

822
00:34:42,645 --> 00:34:44,430
And there has
to be consequences.

823
00:34:47,128 --> 00:34:48,260
Doesn't mean you love them
any less.

824
00:34:48,303 --> 00:34:52,133
It just means...

825
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:53,613
parenting is hard.

826
00:34:53,656 --> 00:34:54,875
His mom confessed.

827
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:57,095
And Corey Harris passed
the polygraph,

828
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:59,662
so we had to release him.

829
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:01,229
Doesn't sound like
you believe he's innocent.

830
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:04,319
My belief or lack thereof
is irrelevant.

831
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:07,888
The decision to charge lies
solely with the D.A.'s office,

832
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:11,544
and they didn't think
it was a case they could win.

833
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:13,546
Does that make you angry?

834
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:16,157
No. I mean, a high-profile case
like this

835
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,942
and a guilty plea ready to go?

836
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:21,249
I wouldn't have charged him
either.

837
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:23,991
That doesn't mean I think he
should've gotten away with it.

838
00:35:24,034 --> 00:35:26,298
Well, but he didn't actually
get away with it, did he?

839
00:35:26,341 --> 00:35:28,169
Well...

840
00:35:30,954 --> 00:35:32,826
Good evening, Worthy ones.

841
00:35:32,869 --> 00:35:35,045
Welcome to my evening sermon,

842
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:40,007
streamed across
all my social platforms.

843
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:46,187
You know, we are so blessed.

844
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:50,452
So blessed to shine in the light
of Our Saviors Above.

845
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:51,845
You don't know the comfort
I've drawn

846
00:35:51,888 --> 00:35:53,890
knowing that one day soon,

847
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,805
they will come
to lift us all up.

848
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:00,680
Hello?

849
00:36:05,293 --> 00:36:06,512
Nobody's supposed to be here.

850
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:09,558
Uh... where was I?

851
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:11,560
Um... right.

852
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:13,388
Our Saviors.

853
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:15,303
They spoke to me last night.

854
00:36:15,347 --> 00:36:18,350
The stars seemed to part
as I was out in the night sky,

855
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:23,093
and I could hear their voices
just as clear as you hear mine,

856
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:24,051
and they said --

857
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:27,707
What the hell?

858
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,361
The electric bill's on auto-pay.

859
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:35,454
Hello?

860
00:36:35,497 --> 00:36:37,238
Aurora Number 2, is that you?

861
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:39,284
This isn't funny!

862
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:40,981
Come on.

863
00:36:44,071 --> 00:36:45,333
Be right back.

864
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,186
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

865
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:22,327
Aah! How is this so heavy?!

866
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:31,466
Oh, my God!

867
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,207
Oh, no, no, no.

868
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:39,039
Siri -- Siri, dial 911, please.

869
00:37:39,082 --> 00:37:42,825
Pick up. Pick up. Pick up.

870
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:44,914
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

871
00:37:44,958 --> 00:37:46,525
Help. Someone's in my house.

872
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:47,830
I'm in danger.

873
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:49,876
I am the savior,
the Prophet Jedediah.

874
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:51,312
I can't die.

875
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:55,882
<i>Sir, are you still there?</i>

876
00:37:57,492 --> 00:37:59,364
Oh, no!

877
00:38:00,669 --> 00:38:02,584
I'm scared! I don't want to die!

878
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:16,119
Police! Don't move!

879
00:38:16,163 --> 00:38:17,643
Drop your weapon!

880
00:38:17,686 --> 00:38:18,731
Hands on your head.

881
00:38:18,774 --> 00:38:20,515
Interlace your fingers. Now!

882
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:21,864
You got him? Yeah.

883
00:38:21,908 --> 00:38:23,475
Don't move.

884
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:30,438
Give me your other hand.

885
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:32,353
Ronald Sanchez.

886
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:33,485
Where's Corey Harris?

887
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:36,052
Most of him's inside.

888
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:37,706
Except his eyes.

889
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,534
You just found those.

890
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:40,927
Harper.

891
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,102
You got to bag them as evidence

892
00:38:42,145 --> 00:38:43,756
and we got to clear the house.

893
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,717
What happened here, Ronald?

894
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:50,371
My coming-out party.

895
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,593
Yeah. It turned out
the Southland Stalker

896
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,377
had an accomplice after all,

897
00:38:56,421 --> 00:38:59,511
and he was pissed
that Corey convinced Dan

898
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:01,730
to take all the credit
during his trial.

899
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,079
I'm sorry. Can I say "pissed"?

900
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:04,559
Look, I know it's crazy.

901
00:39:04,603 --> 00:39:06,605
But, I mean, this dude's
a freakin' serial killer who --

902
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:08,302
who puts eyes in his pocket.

903
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,652
He's not exactly firing
on all cylinders.

904
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:19,922
Control, we got one in custody.

905
00:39:19,966 --> 00:39:23,056
Going back inside to
look for the homeowner.

906
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,719
Ready? Uh-huh.

907
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,602
Oh, no.

908
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:50,126
Control, we got a 187.

909
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:54,130
Mobilize detectives,
a supervisor, and TID.

910
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,523
I think...

911
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,264
I think this thing is still on.

912
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:58,613
It was.

913
00:39:58,657 --> 00:40:00,136
By the time Harper and Nolan
secured the scene,

914
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,530
Corey's live stream
had 400,000 viewers.

915
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,271
Okay. Look. The case
was definitely weird.

916
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:05,315
But I mean, come on.

917
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,665
All this?

918
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,623
This feels so exploitational.

919
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,365
The low-hanging fruit
of celebrity scandal and murder.

920
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,932
You should be making
serious documentaries

921
00:40:12,975 --> 00:40:14,412
about things that really matter.

922
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:15,717
My last film
was about climate injustice

923
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:16,936
in Puerto Rico.

924
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:19,460
It won a BAFTA.

925
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:20,940
Oh.

926
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:23,290
Well, alright, then.

927
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,988
I j-- I just want to say
this has been so fascinating.

928
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:28,730
I love true crime,
and to be in a documentary,

929
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:30,471
it's just --
it's a dream come true.

930
00:40:30,515 --> 00:40:31,820
Thank you. Thank you.

931
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:33,126
Thank you so much
for doing this.

932
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:34,823
Yeah.

933
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:36,564
You got -- You got something
in your hair.

934
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,957
What? It's kind of --

935
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,175
Has it been there
the whole time?

936
00:40:39,219 --> 00:40:40,699
Yeah. It's pretty big.
Let's get out of here.

937
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:42,135
I would tell you if you had
broccoli in your teeth, man.

938
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:43,745
What the heck?

939
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:45,791
Were you surprised
that Ronald killed Corey?

940
00:40:45,834 --> 00:40:47,227
No, no. Not at all.

941
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,142
Guy's out of his mind.

942
00:40:49,185 --> 00:40:51,100
He was always super jealous
of my fame too,

943
00:40:51,144 --> 00:40:54,103
so I guess he needed
to get some for himself.
