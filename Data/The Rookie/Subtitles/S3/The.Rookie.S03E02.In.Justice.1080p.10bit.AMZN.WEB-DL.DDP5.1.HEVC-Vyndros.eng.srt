Oh, Lucy. She's, uh,
smoke-cleansing your house.

00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:18,975
Okay, all done.

00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,064
Armstrong's energy is no longer
welcome in this home.

But if you feel it coming back,
just call me.

11

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,072
this is good. You know what?

14
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:30,595
We should really
cleanse the station.

15
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:33,207
Oh, trust me, that process
is already under way.

16

They've reassigned
about a third of our officers

17

to other divisions, bringing in
a bunch of new blood.

18
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:39,735
Word is, my new T.O.
is from Valley Bureau.

19
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:42,477
Man, it sucks that Lopez
couldn't finish your training.

20
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,913
Yeah, but I'm psyched for her.

21
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:45,567
I mean, being a detective
is all she ever wanted.

22
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,048
On the bright side -- even if
your new T.O. is a nightmare,

00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,788
you've only got 25 days
till you graduate.

24
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,138
You should be moving up with us.

25
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,053
It is not fair
that Grey's holding you back.

26
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:54,924
That letter of reprimand
was severe enough.

27
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:56,752
I screwed up.

28
00:00:56,795 --> 00:00:58,449
Actions have consequences.

29
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:01,452
But when you graduate,
you have to celebrate.

45
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:30,394

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,848
but we've already
had five housekeepers quit,

00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:51,198
and I really like this one.

54
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:53,200
This is <i>your</i> fault.
You got me pregnant.

55
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:55,985

Yeah, but I have to make my mark
as detective before they do.

66
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,529

Chen does. Oh.

00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:46,818
Turns out, that room needs
some serious earthquake retrofitting.

And we've just been sitting
in it day after day?

In the wake of recent events,

80
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:53,999
several changes have been
instituted department-wide.

81
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:56,088
Officer Bradford, you want
to read the top line change?

82
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:57,525
Yes, sir.

83
00:02:57,568 --> 00:03:00,180
"Any officer requesting
a copy of a police report

84
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,964
must get written approval
by a sergeant.

85
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:03,792
After use, all copies
must be destroyed.

86
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:05,489
Failure to do so
will result in discipline."

87
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,143
Officer West?

88
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,711
"Every recruit in the
academy must now report all contact

no matter how small."

90
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,280

91
00:03:13,323 --> 00:03:15,412

00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:19,024
without also providing the
department with the number."

94
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,331
Do I have to tell my girlfriend
about it, too?

95
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:25,727
These changes are necessary.

96
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,643
What Nick Armstrong did
has tarnished the badge

97
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,384
and made all of our jobs harder.

98
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:32,037
We have to prove
to the community

99
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,735
that we are still
worthy of their trust.

100
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,563
And I know
each and every one of you

101
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:37,347
will go the extra mile
to do that.

102
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,914
To business.

103
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:41,046

Officer Doug Stanton.

104

Where you at? Here, sir.

105
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,615
Officer Stanton
will be taking over

106
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:46,226
the training of Officer West.

107
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,271
And finally,
we've been asked to man

108
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:50,012
the Fourth Street
Community Center this week.

109
00:03:50,055 --> 00:03:51,492
Harper, Nolan, you're up.

110
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:53,102
And the punishment continues.

111
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:54,103
Be safe out there.

112
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:55,322
U-Uh, sir, real quick.

113
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:57,367
Um, my car was stolen yesterday.

114
00:03:57,411 --> 00:03:59,543
It's in the SVS,
but I took the liberty

115
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,502

on patrol,

117
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,419
I would really be grateful
if you could just text.

118
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,290
Is this the car
you left unlocked?

119
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:09,466

We'll start there.

179
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:21,859
Not what I pictured.

180
00:06:21,903 --> 00:06:23,687
They're all like this.

181
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:25,080
Bottom of
the funding food chain.

182
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:27,125
Well, there goes
the neighborhood.

183
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:28,431
Policía.

184
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,346
I'm Officer Nolan.
This is Detective Harper.

185
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,566
Don't bother. You won't be here
long enough for me to remember.

186
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:37,266
Okay. Well, if you change
your mind, uh, drop on by.

187
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:39,486
We'd love to hear any
concerns you have about what's
going on in the community.

188
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:42,184
<i>You're</i> my concern
about what's going on
in this community.

189
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:43,403
They only staff this place

190
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,622
when the department's
doing damage control.

191
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,495
Well, that way, the higher-ups
can congratulate themselves

192
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:52,107
on how much they care,
without actually doing anything.

193
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,501
Well, if that's your take,
what are you doing here?

194
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:55,980
Just trying to make
a difference. We're being punished.

195
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,199
I like her.

196
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,201
Okay. Well,
you know where we'll be.

197
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:03,074
So far, so good.

198
00:07:03,118 --> 00:07:05,860
That was not
the warmest of welcomes.

199
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:07,688
You expected otherwise?

200
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:11,779
Look, I know you think all this
is just Grey twisting the knife,

201
00:07:11,822 --> 00:07:13,476
but I honestly believe
he wants us

202
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,652
to use our newfound perspective
to engage with the neighbors.

203
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,306
Sure. You go with that. I will.

204
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,742
Is that your lunch?

205
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:21,397
Uh, no, it's enough jollof rice
to feed about 30 kids,

206
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:25,662
as well as some egusi
and some moin moin.

207
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:27,098
Nigerian food.

208
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:29,405
It's, uh, Heritage Day
at Lila's school,

209
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,495
and I am supposed to bring
a traditional dish.

210
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:33,931
<i>A</i> dish?

211
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:35,846
I may have gone
a little overboard.

212
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,326
But I just --

213
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:39,894
I want Lila to see
that I am here for her now.

214
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:41,635
When did you sleep? I didn't.

215
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,769
Listen, you do not know
these moms. They go all out.

216
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,902
I swear, I --
Not one of them has a job.

217
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:49,512
Judging other moms.

218
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,992
Now you're getting
the hang of parenting.

219
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:52,602
I got a lot of time
to make up for.

220
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:55,910
I just -- I want Lila to see
that I am invested.

221
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:56,998
Try this.

222
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,092
Wow. Too spicy?

223
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:05,615
For children? Mm.

224
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:08,139
Sure. It's good.

225
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:10,446
Oh, good.

226
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,361
Whew! You scared me.

227
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:16,017
Nice speech
by the Watch Commander.

228
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,367
Oh, it wasn't just a speech.
Grey means it.

229
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,717
Sure. I get it.
A few bad apples taint us all.

230
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,545
These personnel shifts
and rule changes

231
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,591
make it harder
for good cops to do the job.

232
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:27,158
Well, I'm not afraid
of a little hard work, sir.

233
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:28,551
Whatever it takes
to do things right.

234
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,901
Spoken like a true rookie.

235
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:33,121
So, tell me about you.

236
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:35,079
Married? Kids?

237
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:37,560
Married, yep, 13 years,
two kids.

238
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:38,866
Nice. Nice.

239
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,345
What's the wife do?

240
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,738
Giselle's a teacher.

241
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,566
Hopefully, she turns my kids
into doctors.

242
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,263
So no more cops in the family?

243
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:46,743
Nah.

244
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:48,571
Job's changed.

245
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:52,227
People used to respect us,
look to us for help.

246
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,752
Nah. These days, I wouldn't wish
being a cop on anybody.

247
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:59,582
Not the words of encouragement
you were hoping for.

248
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:02,585
Hey, I am always happy
to hear another point of view.

249
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,937
Oh. You, uh, mind if I get this?

250
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,373
Partner, not T.O., remember?

251
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:10,637
Yo.

252
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,073
<i>How's, uh, community policing?</i>

253
00:09:12,116 --> 00:09:13,335
Room for improvement.

254
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:14,945
Hey, do you have any interest
in tutoring

255
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,773
for a couple hours this week
after shift?

256
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:21,256
Just wanted to offer some perks
here at the CPC, you know,

257
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,518
<i>draw in some of the neighbors.</i>

258
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,693
<i>Lucy said she's on board. What's the pay?</i>

259
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:24,912
A sense of accomplishment.

260
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:26,130
Sign me up.

261
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:27,392
You're the best. Thank you.

262
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,612
Now, should a copier
be making this noise?

263
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,965
No calls pending. Might as well
see if we can help.

264
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:38,186
What's the problem?

265
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:40,928
Hell if I know.
It's like a spaceship in here.

266
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:43,495
It's all computers these days.
Let me take a look.

267
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,630
Took you long enough.

268
00:09:47,674 --> 00:09:49,719
Almost had to give away
your first case.

269
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:51,678
There was a line,
but I'm good to go.

270
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:54,376
It's a burglary report
from a funeral parlor overnight.

271
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:58,554
Could be addicts
looking for embalming fluid.

272
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,860
Or weirdo sex stuff.

273
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,557
Either way, check it out.

274
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,124
Call me when you get back.

275
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,387
Newbies pick up lunch, too.

276
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,477
LAPD Community Center, right
across the street, over there.

277
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,913
We have ticket sign-offs,

278
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,263
crime-stat updates,
after-school tutoring.

279
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:13,613
Just want to come in and talk,
say hi, just come on in,

00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,092

You check

Last night.
But they haven't been touched.

308

And nothing else
seems to be missing.

309
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:25,859
Why would someone break in
and not take anything?

Got him.

318
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:06,421
Hey, come on! Take it easy!

319
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:07,944
It's okay, we're just
arresting him for burglary

320
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,293
for stealing this backpack.

321
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,991
What, you need four cops
for a kid stealing a bag?

322
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:12,035
Yo, my man, back off.

323
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,384

324
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,430
Look, calling for backup is
simply protocol.

325
00:12:15,473 --> 00:12:17,127
We don't know
if the suspect is armed.

326
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:18,955
Better safe than sorry. Safe for who?

327
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:20,783
Not for people
who look like him. Or me.

328
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:22,045
You want us to stick around?

329
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,525
No, uh, we're cool.

330
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:24,787
I'm <i>not</i> cool.

331
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,311
Are <i>you?</i>

332
00:12:27,355 --> 00:12:30,314
Look, this guy just made
one of your neighbors a victim.

333
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,055
Okay? He's going in. Simple.

334
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,970
It's never that simple. Alright?

335
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:36,625
If the city wasn't spending
50% of its budget on cops,

336
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,279
then maybe he would
have gotten a leg up

337
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:39,802
instead of the short end
of the stick.

338
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:42,109
Look, I hear you.
Trust me, I do.

339
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:43,763
But I don't have
a time machine, okay?

340
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,242
So right here, right now,

341
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,766
this guy just broke
someone's window,

342
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:48,985
which is not cheap to fix, <i>and</i>
he took their property.

343
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:51,074
So if you want to help him,
help him get a good lawyer.

344
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,773
I will.

345
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,561
Are we just supposed to
ignore crime, in his eyes?

346
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:00,867
It's not that easy.

347
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,782
I mean, he's fighting
against a rigged system,

348
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:05,132
and he is not winning.

349
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:06,263
Wears you down.

350
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:11,094
Uh, you mind taking a walk
back to the center?

351
00:13:11,138 --> 00:13:13,270
I, uh, can still make it
to Lila's school on time.

352
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,794
No. Yeah, of course. What are
you gonna do about the food?

353
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:15,751
Improvise.

354
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,579
Good luck.

355
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,759
Dispatch, can you connect me
to City Services?

356
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,762
<i>City Services. This is Mike.</i>

357
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,243
Hey, Mike.
Uh, this is Officer John Nolan.

358
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:33,160
I'm standing at a park gate
on the 500 block of West Elm,

359
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,552
with a bike lock on the gate.

360
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:35,640
Is that you guys?

361
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,033
<i>A bike lock? No way.</i>

362
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:38,469
So you wouldn't have an issue
if I took it down?

363
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:39,514
<i>No, sir.</i>

364
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:40,254
Excuse me.

365
00:13:40,297 --> 00:13:42,125
Hi. Me again.

366
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:43,735
I don't suppose you have
a pair of cable cutters

367
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,128
I could borrow?

368
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,087
Sure. You're trustworthy enough,
I guess.

369
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,046
Oh, I don't know if
James would agree with
you, but yes, I am.

370
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,439
You been working
with this crew long?

371
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:54,181
No. James just throws me jobs
when he can.

372
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:56,792
Most days, I just line up
at the local Home Depot,

373
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,228
take whatever work drives up.

374
00:13:58,272 --> 00:14:00,143
Used to own
my own construction company,

375
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:02,667
but that went belly up
when the economy tanked.

376
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:04,017
I was in construction
in Pennsylvania

377
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,322
before I became a cop.

378
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:08,543
Yeah, I had...
more than a few very lean years.

379
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,980
Oh, "lean's" being kind.
I almost lost my house.

380
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:12,721
Something to be said
for day work, though.

381
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:15,071
Doesn't pay great, but it also
doesn't keep me up at night

382
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:17,247
worrying about
how I'm gonna make payroll.

383
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,901
You know what? Um...

384
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,816
Write your name and number on
the back of one of those for me.

385
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,253
I have cops coming to me
asking me to do jobs
for them all the time.

386
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:24,951
I would be happy
to throw them your way.

387
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,648
That'd be great. Thanks. Yeah, no problem.

388
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:27,910
Uh, I'll be right back
with these.

389
00:14:27,954 --> 00:14:29,129
Write down that number. Yeah.

390
00:14:39,052 --> 00:14:39,879
Park's open.

391
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,491
What the hell is wrong with you?

392
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:45,275
It was a simple burglary call.

393
00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:47,103
You could have closed out
the case as a non-worker.

394
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:48,800
Instead, I'm hearing
that you have the coroner

395
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:50,411
and a full CSU team on site.

396
00:14:50,454 --> 00:14:52,239
Yes, sir.
It's a possible homicide.

397
00:14:52,282 --> 00:14:54,589
No. It's an albatross
around your neck.

398
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,417
Those ovens burn
at 1,800 degrees.

399
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,897
The DNA is most likely cooked.

400
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,289
And unless you have a victim,

401
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,987
the lab moves you
to the end of the line,

402
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,990
so they won't even get
to those fragments for months.

403
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:07,210
No victim, no cause of death
means no homicide.

404
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:09,343
All you have is a Health
and Safety Code violation

405
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:10,779
for improperly
disposing of a body.

406
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:14,174
I'm impressed.

407
00:15:14,217 --> 00:15:15,653
The way you made it
over that fence --

408
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,786
couldn't do that
even back when I <i>was</i> your age.

409
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:19,788
You ever think about a career
in SWAT or Metro?

410
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,529
Only all the time.

411
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,574
Buddy of mine's
a commander over at SWAT.

412
00:15:23,618 --> 00:15:24,706
I can put in a good word.

413
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:26,621
Yeah, that would be amazing.

414
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:27,796
Alright.

415
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,974
7-Adam-19,
show us Code 6 Get out of my car.

416
00:15:32,018 --> 00:15:33,367
for an on-view 415.Get out!

417
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,760
This is your house.
Get out -- now!

418
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:37,110
What seems to be the problem?

419
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,547
The problem is
the drunk giant in my back seat.

420
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,724
We landed here 20 minutes ago,
and he refuses to get out!

421
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,944
Sir, get out of the car. Tim: Can
you please stand on the sidewalk?

422
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,858
Don't hurt the car.
It's my only source of income.

423
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:49,252
What is the goal of this call,
Officer Chen?

424
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:51,472
To get the Mountain's
ugly cousin out of the car.

425
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:53,474
Wrong. It is to get him
out of the car

426
00:15:53,517 --> 00:15:55,302
without making things worse.

427
00:15:55,345 --> 00:15:58,044
Now, do you think you can get him
out without relying on your weapons?

428
00:15:58,087 --> 00:15:59,567
Really? A Tim Test right now?

429
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,829
Our goal as police officers

430
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:02,787
should be to de-escalate
whenever possible.

431
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:05,181
This from the guy
who set me up to fight
a suspect on day one?

432
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,704
Does this mean
you're not up to the challenge?

433
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,837
No, sir. I am game for whatever
you want to throw at me.

434
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,491
Great. So, here's the deal.

435
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:11,883
You start with 100 points.

436
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,929
Reach for anything on your belt,
and you lose points.

437
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,670
Baton is 10. Taser equals 15.

438
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:17,454
If you take out your gun,
that's 50.

439
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:19,152
Leave this call
with 85 points or less,

440
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:21,763
and you lose and I write up
a blue page on you.

441
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,808
Getting one of those at this stage of
your training would be a real problem.

442
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:25,593
Can I <i>earn</i> points? Absolutely.

443
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,203
You get him calm, 5 points.

444
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:29,031
He agrees
to get out of the car, 10.

445
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,381
You get him to apologize
to the driver, 20 points.

446
00:16:31,425 --> 00:16:33,601
But if you use
any of your weapons,

447
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:34,906
game over -- you lose.

448
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,604
Back up. I got this.

449
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:40,521
Excuse me. Hi.

450
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:42,392
I'm Officer Chen.
What's your name?

451
00:16:42,436 --> 00:16:44,133
I want the pretty girl.
Where'd the pretty girl go?

452
00:16:44,177 --> 00:16:45,656
Well, she's right out here.

453
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,744
Why don't you come out
and see her?

454
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,268
You're trying to trick me.

455
00:16:48,311 --> 00:16:50,487
They told me all about that
in the Marines.

456
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:51,619
You're a Marine?

457
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:53,360
Two tours in country. Oorah.

458
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:57,538
Thank you for your service.

459
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,757
Why don't you get on out
and let the pretty girl
have her car back?

460
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:01,455
Don't tell me what to do.

461
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:03,674
Ooh! That's 15, Officer Chen.

462
00:17:03,718 --> 00:17:05,589
You're already
in the loss column.

463
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,809
Let's go out.

464
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:09,245
Eat a bag of d--Not helping.

465
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:11,160
I'm not a bad guy. Sir, look --

466
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:12,770
Back off! Okay. Okay.

467
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:15,382
Look, I get it.

468
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:18,080
It's been hard being home,

469
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:19,995
back in your life,
where nothing feels normal.

470
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,389
But she's just trying
to do her job.

471
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:24,913
And I know your mother didn't
teach you to disrespect women --

472
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:27,350
Don't talk about my mom.

473
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:29,483
She died when I was over there.

474
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,702
I'm so sorry.

475
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:36,794
You know she would tell you
that you're better than this.

476
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:38,666
You fought for freedom,
and that includes

477
00:17:38,709 --> 00:17:42,452
this girl's freedom
from you harassing her 'cause...

478
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,281
'cause you got drunk and lonely.

479
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,808
You're right.

480
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,029
I'm sorry.

481
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,509
Don't apologize to <i>me.</i>

482
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,255
I'm sorry.

483
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:03,038
Bite me.

484
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,434
Fine.

485
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:08,435
Thanks.

486
00:18:08,478 --> 00:18:10,350
Do you live here, sir?

487
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:11,438
Yeah, upstairs.

488
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,309
Alright. Head on up,
straight to bed.

489
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:15,181
And just take it easy
next time you're at the bar.

490
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:15,833
Yeah.

491
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:22,492
Calm, plus leaving,
plus an apology.

492
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:23,711
I crushed this test.

493
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:25,800
Nice recovery.

494
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:27,367
Mm-hmm. Have a great day, ma'am.

495
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:29,630
Oh! Uh, just wait one second.

496
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:32,589
Have you seen this car while
you've been driving around?

497
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,982
Mm. Super cute. Yeah, thanks.

498
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:35,157
You know what?

499
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,289
I did see it.

500
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:37,333
Where?

501
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:42,904
There it is.

502
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:47,517
Somebody's inside.

503
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,130
Control 7-Adam-19,
occupied 10-8-5-1,

504
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:52,522
Wilshire Normandy Station.

505
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,002
Stop right there! Put your hands
on top of your head.

506
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:54,916
Fingers interlaced.

507
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,314
You are under arrest
for auto theft.

508
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:03,620
No. You don't understand.
I didn't steal the car.

509
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:05,753
The guy who owns it lent it
to me, but he lost the keys.

510
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:06,797
<i>I'm</i> the guy who owns the car.

511
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:09,539
You didn't even lock it.
What did you expect?

512
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,584
Yeah, well, it doesn't lock.

513
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:11,846
It does now.

514
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:13,195
What? How did you fix it?

515
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:15,197
It was easy.
Just popped off the door panel.

516
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,460
Took like two minutes.

517
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:19,462
Wait, are you living in here?
How old are you?

518
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:20,463
17.

519
00:19:20,507 --> 00:19:21,421
Where are your parents?

520
00:19:22,683 --> 00:19:23,858
Dead.

521
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:32,214
Alright, anything in here that's
gonna stick me? Needles, knives?

522
00:19:32,258 --> 00:19:33,084
No.How long have you been
living on the street?

523
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:33,824
A year.

524
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,304
Careful with that!

525
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:39,482
Oh.

526
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:40,962
Sorry.

527
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,442
Must be hard living like this.

528
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:43,660
What do you care?

529
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,405
Uh... I-I'm not
gonna press charges.

530
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:50,798
Here, stand up.

531
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,496
Seriously?

532
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,542
Yeah, it's my car,
my prerogative.

533
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:57,065
Boot --We'll get you set up

534
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:58,414
over at a children's shelter,
alright?

535
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,416
Oh, you don't have to.
I got someplace else I can go.

536
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,897
Does it have doors that lock
and people that care about you?

537
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,420
Does the children's shelter?

538
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,770
You know how many times I got
my stuff stolen from there?

539
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:08,555
And it's too far from school.

540
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:09,686
You still go to school?

541
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,906
Yeah. I do.
And I get good grades.

542
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:13,255
Any more dumb questions?

543
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:17,999
Look, I don't want to make
getting to school hard for you,

544
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,174
but I don't have a choice here,

545
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,002
so it's either jail
or the shelter.

546
00:20:21,045 --> 00:20:22,264
But I won't just
dump you there, okay?

547
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,874
I'll -- I'll help you find
a permanent place.

548
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:24,919
Is she for real?

549
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:27,182
Officer Chen, a word.

550
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,488
You, stand here,
hands on the car.

551
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,016
Congratulations. On what?

552
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:36,452
On your first puppy. What?

553
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:38,193
Every rookie adopts a puppy
at some point --

554
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,761
someone they think
they can save.

555
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:42,023
Honestly, I'm surprised
it took you this long.

556
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:43,285
Did <i>you</i> have a puppy?

557
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,113
That's... not relevant here.Mm-hmm.

558
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:46,941
What <i>is
is that it never goes well.</i>

559
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:48,377
Okay, well, she's not a puppy.

560
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:51,032
She's a girl in trouble,
and I'm gonna help her. Okay?

561
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,688
7-Adam-07, show us Code 6

562
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:56,864
on the burglary call
at 1119 Brower.

563
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:59,780
<i>7-Adam-07, copy.</i>

564
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:03,087
Hey. Um, I'm D'Andre,
and these are my folks.

565
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,524
They don't really speak
much English.

566
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:05,525
West African?

567
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:07,091
Uh, Somalia, actually.

568
00:21:07,135 --> 00:21:08,615
I was born in Long Beach.

569
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:11,139
So, uh, someone
broke into your home?

570
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,706
Yeah. We -- We spent the night
in Bakersfield

571
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:14,185
for my basketball tournament.

572
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,753
Just got home a few hours ago,
and door was busted open.

573
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,842
TVs, computers,
and my mom's jewelry.

574
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:20,366
Sorry to hear that.

575
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:22,324
Used to play a little ball
back in high school.

576
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,413
Used to call me the Dougernaut.

577
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:25,414
You got a nickname?

578
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,763
Not... really.

579
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,635
Uh, "D" sometimes.

580
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:30,593
"D," huh? "D-Ball."

581
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:33,030
Nice. I like it.

582
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:34,858
So, did anyone know
you'd be gone?

583
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,512
Did you post on social
or anything like that?

584
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:37,948
Got any tattoos, D-Ball?

585
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:41,909
I mean... one.

586
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:44,868
A little, tiny dot
I gave myself when I was 13.

587
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:46,435
See?

588
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:48,437
So, who are you claiming
these days, D?

589
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:50,352
What?

590
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:53,050
Uh, I'm not claiming anybody.
I'm not in a gang.

591
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:54,356
So, you're not
Murder East Nation?

592
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,401
State Line Crew?

593
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,185
No, dude, <i> we</i> got robbed.

594
00:21:57,228 --> 00:21:58,926
You owe anybody money, D-Ball?

595
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:00,275
What --

596
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,451
Sometimes burglaries
will have personal motives.

597
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:04,845
My partner is just trying
to narrow the suspect field.

598
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,849
Look, sir, could I ask you
a favor, partner to partner?

599
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:10,503
What is it?

600
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:12,592
Officer Lopez never let me do
any interviews alone,

601
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:14,637
and I could use the practice
over the next three weeks

602
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,378
before I end up riding solo.

603
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,119
You'd be doing me
a real solid, sir.

604
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:21,644
Alright.

605
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:23,646
I'll be back in the shop.

606
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,300
But your report
better be bulletproof.

607
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,433
If I find as much as a typo,
it's a blue page.

608
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:28,303
Understood.

609
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:34,440
Look, I, um -- I got to
apologize about my partner.

610
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:35,963
He's done
a lot of work with gangs,

611
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:37,617
and it gets kind of stuck
in his head.

612
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,924
Would you please show me
the point of entry, sir?

613
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:42,143
Yeah.

614
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,841
Round of applause
for the conquering hero.

615
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:46,365
What happened?

616
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,671
I snagged a deep-dish pizza
on the way there,

617
00:22:48,715 --> 00:22:51,544
'cause Donovan is from Chicago,
so, you know, heritage.

618
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:53,502
And kids love pizza. Only thing they ate.

619
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:56,853
One mom -- she brought
this jellied fish thing.

620
00:22:56,897 --> 00:22:58,725
One kid cried when he saw it.

621
00:22:58,768 --> 00:23:00,814
Looks like I win at momming.

622
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:02,424
Not sure that's exactly
how you're supposed to see it.

623
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:03,643
Shh! Ba-- Shh!

624
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:06,123
I'm enjoying my triumph.

625
00:23:06,167 --> 00:23:07,516
Anyway, how are things
going here?

626
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,084
Great. I signed off
on a couple fix-it tickets.

627
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:12,434
Came up with some ideas for
reaching out to the community.

628
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,435
Would you like to hear them?

629
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:14,567
Sure.

630
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,438
All set.

631
00:23:16,482 --> 00:23:18,266
Thanks for
letting me do that.
Mm-hmm.

632
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:21,443
Get to work on that report.

633
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:26,535
Did one of you clip
the bike lock in the park?

634
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,145
I did. Yeah.
Are the kids using it?

635
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:30,757
Yeah, luckily, my oldest
found the dirty needles

636
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,585
in the sandbox
before little kids played in it.

637
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:35,414
I had no idea.

638
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,677
Did you at any point
stop to wonder

639
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,243
why the lock was even there?

640
00:23:39,287 --> 00:23:41,245
Those lights have been busted
for a year.

641
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:43,378
Do you know what happens
in a dark public park?

642
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,640
Yes, drug dealers.

643
00:23:44,684 --> 00:23:47,121
And junkies and who the hell
knows what else.

644
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:49,210
We lock the park
to keep them out.

645
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:51,255
We could have helped.
You should have called 911.

646
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,475
To do what?
Clear them out for the night?

647
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,955
Maybe kill someone
in the process?

648
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:57,000
We're not <i>all trigger-happy.</i>

649
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,698
I mean, most of us want to help.

650
00:23:58,741 --> 00:24:00,395
I don't know about "most."

651
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:04,181
But I can't roll the dice that
a good cop is gonna show up.

652
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:05,487
So we found our own solution.

653
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:07,489
The lock was there
to protect us,

654
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,317
to protect our kids.

655
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,797
Look, you shouldn't have to
trade a place to play

656
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,928
for safety.

657
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:13,495
No.

658
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:15,105
We shouldn't.

659
00:24:15,149 --> 00:24:16,455
But we do.

660
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:20,894
♪♪

661
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:39,434
City gave you permission
to work on this yourself?

662
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,957
Uh, yeah.

663
00:24:41,001 --> 00:24:42,959
Took some convincing, and I
got to do it on my own time.

664
00:24:43,003 --> 00:24:44,918
All the city has to do now
is come and inspect.

665
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:48,008
Until then, lights are working.

666
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:50,967
Hey, that's just great.

667
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,578
You must feel real good
about yourself.

668
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:54,101
Actually,
my shoulders and my back

669
00:24:54,144 --> 00:24:55,537
are a little angry with me.

670
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,060
And what about tonight?

671
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:59,193
When they break the lights
again? What then?

672
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:00,803
Uh, cameras are on the way,
and the Watch Commander

673
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:02,544
has approved more patrols
in the area,

674
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:05,155
so if anybody's caught
messing with the lights,
they'll be arrested.

675
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:08,202
So, more Black and Brown people
in prison.

676
00:25:08,245 --> 00:25:09,377
And then you'll be gone,

677
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:11,553
and it'll just go back
to the way it was.

678
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,337
I'm just trying to help.

679
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,820
You ever wonder
why cops spend so much time

680
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:20,388
in neighborhoods like this?

681
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:22,129
It's 'cause
the arrests are easy.

682
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:23,522
Hell, I've lost count
of the amount of times

683
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,654
I've seen rookies brought here
and taught,

684
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:27,438
"This is what a junkie
looks like,

685
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:29,832
and this is
what a dealer looks like."

686
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:32,008
And from that moment on,
that's how cops see us.

687
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:34,097
Okay, look, I wasn't
trained like that.

688
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:37,144
Well, that's because your
training officer looks like us.

689
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:39,102
Look, the only person
you helped this morning is <i>you.</i>

690
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:40,408
Made yourself feel good

691
00:25:40,451 --> 00:25:44,238
while you put a Band-Aid
on a systemic wound.

692
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:47,197
You want to make
a <i>real</i> difference?

693
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:51,114
Stop picking on us
and attack crime at the source.

694
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:52,812
Keep meth
out of this neighborhood.

695

both our time.

Uh... Tamara left the shelter
during the night.

700
00:26:08,784 --> 00:26:10,264
The girl who stole my car.

701
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:11,613
Right. Sorry.

702
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,267

in my own little drama.

703

Mm.

704

I talked to her caseworker.
Tamara's had it rough.

705
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:18,925
Both of her parents O.D.'d.

706
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,317
She got taken in by relatives,

707
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:22,972
but there was violence
in the house, so she split.

708
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:24,191
What are you gonna do?

709
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:25,366

710
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:26,715
even though
Tim's giving me a hard time.

711
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:29,849
He calls her my puppy.
Says that every rookie gets one.

712
00:26:29,892 --> 00:26:31,851
He's just being judgy.
You know how he is.

713
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:34,636
Uh, all due respect, screw Tim.

714
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,725
Yeah, and all the other T.O.S.

715

716

of the food chain,

717
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:42,601

through somebody else's hoops.

this one family.

724
00:26:55,962 --> 00:26:57,311

725
00:26:57,354 --> 00:26:59,966
No, no, it's just the way
he -- he talked to them.

Enters it again.

745

Alarm is still going off,

He didn't try
two different codes.

747

Yeah. Sure.

than your former T.O.

762
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:34,669
I've seen a ton
of gang activity in my time.

And that experience

that crooks and dirtbags
always try to hide who they are.

765
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:41,981

a crook or a dirtbag.

Do you know the significance of
that dot tattoo, Officer West?

You see, he has three more

over his heart

771
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:56,865
it makes the area code 213.

If so, that's on me.

You know they're just gonna
smash those out again.

784

That's what James said.

785
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:30,377
But the lights are up,

786

00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:29,165
Well, that wasn't just me.

1050
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:31,994
I mean, Nolan insisted
that we both go personally

1051
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:34,997
so that SWAT would not see Hugo
as a criminal.

1052
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:36,477
Don't write Nolan off.

1053
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:38,044
He is more of a guardian

1054
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:40,133
than any other cop
I have ever worked with.

1055
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:41,613
I mean, right now,
his shift is over,

1056
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:43,179
and yet he's still inside,

1057
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:45,486
waiting for kids
to come by for tutoring.

1058
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,228

No. No.

Nice to meet you.

but I really do appreciate

1075

what you were <i>trying</i> to do
this morning.

1076
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:23,437
Even though it was misguided.

1077
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,352
Yeah.

1078
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:28,094
Plus, they've changed
the way they teach math again,

1079
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:29,791
so I'm a little lost.

1080
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:31,314
Well, you came
to the right place.

1081
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:33,752
Lucy is excellent at math.

1082

<i>Jackson</i> is excellent at math.

1083
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:37,190
Yes, and he will be here soon.

Why don't we,
uh, get you guys settled?

1085
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:39,758
Right this way, gents.

1086
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:43,979
Look, I don't take handouts,

1087
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:46,895
so if you're gonna tutor
my boys, I am gonna pay.

1088
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:47,983
Well, how about this?

1089
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:50,203
Uh, we'll tutor
Michael and Aaron,

1090
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:52,248
and you sit down
and talk to us a little more

1091

about what this neighborhood
really needs.

1092
00:41:56,557 --> 00:41:57,471
I can do that.

1093

Perfect timing.

1094

Jackson, this is James.
You met him outside the park.
