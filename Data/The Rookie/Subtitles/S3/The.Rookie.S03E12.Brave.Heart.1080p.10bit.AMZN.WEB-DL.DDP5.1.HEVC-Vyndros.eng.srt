He'll get fired.

Do you know why
they call me "La Fiera"?

8
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:14,753
You were caught in a narco
gunfight with baby Diego,

9
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:16,581

everyone to waste.

What happened?

14
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:35,165
My son was born with
Tetralogy of Fallot.

15
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,124
He collapsed 13 minutes ago.

16
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:38,821
He had five surgeries on his
heart before his first birthday.

17
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,388
Well, that's a severe case
of TOF.

18
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:41,693
Has he been short of breath
recently?

19
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:43,608
Nothing I noticed. Eh, Abigail?

20
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,001
He didn't mention anything.

21
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,176
He would have mentioned it,
right?

22
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,612
What -- What's happening to him?

23
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:49,092
Well, the surgeries
he had as a baby

24
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:51,225
helped to improve
the blood flow to his lungs,

25
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:53,836
but as a patient gets older,
those procedures can cause

26
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,359
the valve between the heart
and the lungs to leak.

27
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:56,882
It's called --

28
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:58,667
Pulmonary valve regurgitation.

29
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,364

Well, I mean, we are gonna
be here for a minute, so...

177
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:16,419
Good point.

178
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:22,991
<i>Thank you for calling Angels
West Extended Care Program.</i>

179
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:25,385
<i>There are... three --
callers ahead of you.</i>

180
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,647
Only three?

181
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,778
Ooh! This is my lucky day.

182
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:30,564
Hey. <i> Our</i> lucky day. Yeah.

183
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,875
I thought it was nothing.

184
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,400
I've been tired,
but we've been really busy with,

185
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,227
uh, my new job.

186
00:06:42,271 --> 00:06:46,014
Everything's just
been fine for so long.

187
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:48,538
I guess I just stopped
thinking about it.

188
00:06:48,582 --> 00:06:49,626
I don't buy it.

189
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,193
Mom.

190
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:53,238
I think this is
some kind of elaborate plan

191
00:06:53,282 --> 00:06:54,457
to reunite me and your father,

192
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,458
"Parent Trap" -style.

193
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:56,807
God, no.

194
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:58,069
You guys are
so much happier apart.

195
00:06:58,113 --> 00:06:59,767
Fair enough. Hi.

196
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,465
Hi. The day we dreaded.

197
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:05,468
Such a drama queen.

198
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:09,124
Okay. It's gonna be okay.

199
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:10,908
Are you in pain?

200
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:12,736
No, I just can't
catch my breath.

201
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,172
Results are in.

202
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,435
It's the pulmonary valve,
isn't it?

203
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,698
Yes, the valve is failing.

204
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:18,873
He'll need surgery to repair it.

205
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:20,178
Is it dangerous?

206
00:07:20,222 --> 00:07:23,051
It can be. You have a choice.

207
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:25,445
We can do a minimally invasive
procedure

208
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:28,012
known as a percutaneous
pulmonary valve replacement

209
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,927
that's relatively safe.

210
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:33,975
Recovery time is about a week,
but the fix won't last.

211
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:36,368
You'll need to have open heart
surgery in about five years.

212
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:38,980
Or they could do the open heart
surgery right now, right?

213
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:42,505
Yes. He'll need to have
a live tissue valve replacement

214
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:43,506
that could last decades.

215
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,073
Well, what are we waiting for?

216
00:07:45,116 --> 00:07:46,814
Sign me up for not wanting
to go through this again

217
00:07:46,857 --> 00:07:47,858
anytime soon.

218
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:49,512
N-Not so fast.

219
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:51,862
We're talking about
a much riskier surgery, right?

220
00:07:51,906 --> 00:07:53,429
Yes.

221
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,953
Henry could have a heart attack
on the operating table.

222
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:58,347
He could bleed into
his chest cavity

223
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,045
or have other complications
after we close him up.

224
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:02,960
But his age --

225
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:05,528
mortality rate for a procedure
like this is, what, 2%, 3%?

226
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:09,924
No, because of factors
related to his prior surgeries,

227
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:14,189
the risk of mortality is higher,
about 20%.

228
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:17,061
Okay. That's a lot to process.

229
00:08:17,105 --> 00:08:19,411
Well, you'll need to
make a decision quickly.

230
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,632
Your heart is very unstable
right now.

231
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:24,199
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

232
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:26,201
Thanks for taking care of him.

233
00:08:26,244 --> 00:08:27,724
Mm-hmm.

234
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:31,206
Obviously, you're having
the procedure

235
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:33,338
that doesn't have a 20% chance
of killing you.

236
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:36,254
I-I think we take the safer bet
and call it a day.

237
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,953
What if that's not what I want?

238
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:40,911
It's my choice.
- I'm an adult.
- Henry --

239
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:43,131
Okay, we don't have to decide
this instant.

240
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:45,960
I mean, let's just take
a breath, take a minute,

241
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:49,703
uh, walk through it,
and go over your options.

242
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,750
Sandra.

243
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:57,624
Look at you.

244
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:01,236
Motherhood suits you.

245
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,194
Didn't think you'd risk your
son's life coming back to L.A.

246
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:05,457
Actually, I'm here
to save my son.

247
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,547
Well, his knee, anyways.

248
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,939
Diego, what happened?

249
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,550
It was so cool.
I was playing <i>fútbol</i>

250
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:12,595
and went full Carlos Vela,
and pop --

251
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,945
partial tear of my ACL,
but I got the goal.

252
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:18,122
He's having surgery today --
top sports doctor in the world.

253
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:19,994
And that's the only reason
you're here in L.A.?

254
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:21,343
Of course.

255
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,218
- It was good to see you.
- You, too.

256
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:29,003
Good luck with the surgery.

257
00:09:29,046 --> 00:09:30,395
Uh...

258
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,184
So, what are you really
doing here?

259
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:39,883
<i>Hermana, don't be so suspicious.</i>

260
00:09:39,927 --> 00:09:42,320
Surely, you have better things
to worry about.

261
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,800
You're here for the baby, no?

262
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:46,629
I was, until I got a call
about you,

263
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:48,413
and now my fiancé
is cursing us both.

264
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:49,632
How is Wesley?

265
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:51,503
He must be so excited.

266
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,027
Relax.

267
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,463
I learned his name
when I was dropping off

268
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:57,118
the present for your baby.

269
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:59,076
And I see you're wearing
the ribbon.

270
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,299
I really hope you're only here
for your son.

271
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:05,822
'Cause if you're
up to something,

272
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,215
it's not gonna end well.

273
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:09,043
For you or Diego.

274
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:18,487
Oh, that's what you're having
for <i>breakfast?</i>

275
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,054
Hey, this happens to have 8%

276
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:22,273
of the recommended daily
allowance of riboflavin.

277
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:23,666
She's all yours.

278
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,625
Thank you.

279
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:27,452
Control, suspect is
medically cleared.

280
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:29,019
We are en route
-to lower booking.

00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:30,586

282
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,240
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

283
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,155
- Oh, she's running again.
- Oh, damn it!

284
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,157
Oh! Sorry!

285
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,812

Something's wrong.

292
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,271
Mnh.

293
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:06,535
Yeah. No more running.

294
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,102
What happened?

295
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:09,886
You had severe abdominal pain
and passed out.

296
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,888
Doctor ordered a CT scan
and an X-ray.

297
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,717
- Uh, no, I don't want that.
- I bet,

298
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:16,676
'cause you've got a stomach full
of drug balloons.

299
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:19,896
No, I don't.

300
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,986
Okay. Billie, we are trained
police officers.

301
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,771
You had a ticket to Ibiza
in your pocket.

302
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:27,208
You ran from the cops,
and now you appear to have

303
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,862
serious intestinal issues.

304
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,515
We're gonna have proof soon,

305
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:31,865
so just tell us what kind
of drugs they are.

306
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,954
Can't you just leave me alone?

307
00:11:33,997 --> 00:11:35,738
Please? No.

308
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:36,913
And right now,
getting busted for drugs

309
00:11:36,957 --> 00:11:39,089
is the least of your problems.

310
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,482
The real concern is
if one of those drug balloons

311
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,092
in your stomach bursts.

312
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,094
Look, if it's filled with
cocaine or meth,

313
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:46,401
your heart rate will
rapidly accelerate

314
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:48,751
until full cardiac arrest,
and then muscles in your chest

315
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,753
will tear apart
as you slowly suffocate.

316
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:53,495
Yeah, and if it's heroin,
fentanyl, or an opioid,

317
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:55,497
you'll ride high for a while,
then you'll crash.

318
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,717
You'll lose all your
motor functions, and you will --

319
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,675
well, you'll vomit
until you're dead.

320
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,025
Well, then we're fine.

321
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:04,419
It was just Molly.
Those are happy pills.

322
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:06,421
Yeah.

323
00:12:06,464 --> 00:12:07,770
How much?

324
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,338
Uh... four condoms.

325
00:12:10,381 --> 00:12:12,732
Like... 80 pills each?

326
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,125
- Okay.
- I'll tell the doctor.

327
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:16,779
Control, notify
on-call narcotics.

328
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:18,041
We have a kilo-plus mule
in custody.

329
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:19,434
What's wrong?

330
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,218
Look, if even one of
those packets burst,

331
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,959
you'll start to hallucinate.

332
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,831
Your body temperature will rise
to 105 degrees,

333
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,223
and you'll die from
a heat stroke

334
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:27,964
during the worst nightmare
of your life.

335
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:31,011
There you are.

336
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:32,969
Sorry. It was a work emergency.

337
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:34,449
Is that true?

338
00:12:34,492 --> 00:12:36,190
I want no part of this.

339
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,148
I had to beg to get
our appointment rescheduled.

340
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:39,715
The OB will see us
in 15 minutes.

341
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,629
You're the best.

342
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:41,804
- Thank you.
- Yes!

343
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:43,240
My buddy came through.

344
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,415
We're having
your bachelorette party

345
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,809
at his sports bar on Sunset.

346
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:49,159
Uh, I'm -- That's -- I'm joking.

347
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,813
That's not -- I would never.

348
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:53,729
I got surveillance footage
of La Fiera from security.

349
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,905
After you left her,
she snuck over to the ICU.

350
00:12:57,864 --> 00:13:00,040
- That's Mack.
- Who?

351
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,650
Uh, Mack Daniels.

352
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:04,087
Uh, he worked undercover
until I got him suspended

353
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:05,567
for drug use on the job.

354
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,829
He's facing criminal charges.

355
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:08,744
And here he is,
talking to a major narco.

356
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,311
That can't be a coincidence.

357
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,529
Let's go ask him.

358
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,925
Can you reschedule our
appointment for a little later?

359
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,840
Thank you. I love you.

360
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:23,498
Oh, damn it.

361
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,891
Mack. What are you doing here?

362
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,718
Working. Private security.

363
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:29,243
- For Sandra de la Cruz?
- No.

364
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:30,766
So, who's your client?

365
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,376
- I don't know.
- Really?

366
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,638
That's how you want to
play this?

367
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,336
When you're clearly 5-50?

368
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:36,728
Come on, Mack.

369
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:37,947
You don't need any more
trouble right now.

370
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:42,212
I'm working for Tomás Madrigal.

371
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:46,695
You do know who that is, right?

372
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:49,480
The largest drug kingpin
in Southern California.

373
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:52,440
He is subject in multiple
ongoing investigations.

374
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:53,876
Yeah, he's dying of cancer.

375
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,225
He only has a few days
left on Earth,

376
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,358
and I lost my ability
to be picky

377
00:13:57,401 --> 00:13:59,664
when my buddy Bradford here
snitched me out.

378
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,884
I lost my paycheck
and my pension.

379
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,886
I'm up to my eyeballs
in lawyer bills,

380
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,627
not to mention the alimony
and child support

381
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,194
I'm gonna owe
once Beth divorces me.

382
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:08,804
So, your solution is to go
work for the enemy?

383
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,632
I'm not breaking any laws.

384
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,242
I'm just standing watch,
making sure that nobody

385
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,809
interrupts an old man's
final moments.

386
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,419
Not even La Fiera?

387
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:16,899
We saw Sandra de la Cruz
come by.

388
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:19,162
- What was she doing here?
- Paying her respects.

389
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:22,339
The old man was sleeping.
She said she'd stop by later.

390
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:23,732
Mack, is there a problem?

391
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:27,388
No. No problem, Mr. Madrigal.

392
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:30,217
I'm just, uh, catching up with
some former colleagues.

393
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,262
Do it on your own time.

394
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:33,655
We're paying you to keep your
mouth shut and watch the door.

395
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:36,440
No, your old man's paying me.

396
00:14:36,484 --> 00:14:38,399
And I'm gone the second he is.

397
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:39,879
Oh, that reminds me.

398
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,924
He, uh...
He was asking for you earlier.

399
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:42,925
Why didn't you call me?

400
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:44,666
- <i>X-ray tech to Radiology.
- Whoops.</i>

401
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:47,016
<i>X-ray tech to Radiology.</i>

402
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,844
Mack.

403
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,541
You sure pissing off the next
El Jefe is a smart move?

404
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:52,195
He's a punk wannabe.

405
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:53,588
That kid'll drive the whole
operation into the ground

406
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:54,981
within six months.

407
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:56,939
Now, if you don't mind, I, uh...

408
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,375
I gotta get back to work.

409
00:14:58,419 --> 00:14:59,724
<i>Med tech to CTU.</i>

410
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,902
<i>Med tech to CTU.</i>

411
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,991
You alright?
He went after you pretty hard.

412
00:15:05,034 --> 00:15:06,949
Yeah, I'm fine.

413
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:09,256
So, clearly, La Fiera is here to
meet with the dying drug lord.

414
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:11,040
We just have to find out why.

415
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:14,217
You know I happen to be
wiretap certified, right?

416
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:15,827
Team work makes
the dream work, baby.

417
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,742
<i>Transition team to OR 2.</i>

418
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:19,831
<i>Transition team -- OR 2.</i>

419
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,052
Alright, so I can listen
for exactly two minutes.

420
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,967
If they are not talking about
anything illegal,

421
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:27,839
I have to wait and shut it off
for 30 seconds,

422
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:28,971
and then I can turn it back on

423
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:30,755
and start the two-minute clock
again.

424
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,887
I wish we had video
inside the room

425
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,889
instead of just the hallway.

426
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,891
Eh, we're lucky the judge
granted the audio surveillance,

427
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,938
but we don't need a warrant
to film in the hallway,

428
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:41,679
and I managed to find
an interesting angle.

429
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:43,072
Nicely done.

430
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,856
Thank you.

431
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,641
Now we just wait
for something to happen.

432
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:50,036
It's been hanging over my head
my whole life, okay?

433
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,038
It's stupid to do
the short-term fix.

434
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,170
I don't want to be here again
in a few years.

435
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:56,607
I want this behind me
for as long as possible.

436
00:15:56,651 --> 00:15:58,000
I get that. We get that.

437
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:00,263
It's just with a minimally
invasive procedure,

438
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:02,787
you'd be on your feet again
-in a week.
-Yeah.

439
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,964
Recovery from open heart
surgery, that'll take months.

440
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,356
You'll have to give up the job.

441
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,184
Then I give it up.

442
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:09,881
Alright? It's -- It's my life.

443
00:16:09,925 --> 00:16:11,753
It's my choice.

444
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:13,929
Hey, it's -- it's gonna be okay.

445
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,106
Alright?
We're gonna grow old together.

446
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,935
I'll have dentures,
and you'll still be

447
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,545
as beautiful as you are
right now.

448
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:23,808
When you were born,

449
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:25,201
your skin was blue.

450
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,727
I've never been so scared
in my life.

451
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:31,729
Until now.

452
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,514
I know it feels like
the worst thing

453
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,081
is to have another surgery
in five years,

454
00:16:35,124 --> 00:16:37,039
but, Henry, that is not
the worst thing.

455
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,041
Henry?

456
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,129
What's happening?
What's happening?

457
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:41,174
- Henry!
- What's happening?

458
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:42,305
Doctor!

459
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,742
Henry? Doc!

460
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:45,787
Hey, buddy. Just breathe.

461
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,049
Hey, just breathe,
nice and easy.

462
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,964
Hey. Henry, Henry. He was fine.

463
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,705
Everybody step away, please.

464
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:51,880
He was fine,
and then all of a sudden --

465
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:54,622
- He's in V-fib.
- Back, please.

466
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:57,320
Charge to 200.
I got rails
on this side.

467
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:59,322
Please, buddy.

468
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:02,282
Chest is clear.

469
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,153
Charging.

470
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:06,547
Down.

471
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,854
Okay, everyone, clear.

472
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,601
Okay, he's stable for now.

473
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:18,689
Let's prep him for surgery.

474
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:21,518
What's the decision?

475
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:24,173
We have to do what he wants.

476
00:17:24,217 --> 00:17:25,827
No, we don't.

477
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,263
No, now's the time
to play it safe

478
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,135
a-and do
the least invasive surgery.

479
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:30,701
After that, we'll reassess.

480
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:31,963
What's the answer?

481
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,574
...tube.
Prepping your meds. 120...

482
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:35,663
What do you think?

483
00:17:35,706 --> 00:17:37,795
I don't know.

484
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,582
We do what he wants.

485
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,192
Anything else will be
a betrayal.

486
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,282
Sarah, he'll be okay.

487
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:52,723
Do the open heart surgery.

488
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:03,952
Mm. Now we just have to wait
until she poops.

489
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:06,128
Who said being a cop
isn't livin' the dream?

490
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:07,782
Just look on the bright side.

491
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,218
We scored a solid drug bust. Mm.

492
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:11,916
And I bet we can get her
to give us her supplier

493
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,570
with the right pressure.

494
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:15,703
Alright, well, I am gonna make
good use of my time.

495
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:20,186
<i>Thank you for calling Angels
West Extended Care Program.</i>

496
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:23,493
<i>There are... 46 --
callers ahead of you.</i>

497
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:24,929
Okay, well,

498
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:26,279
you keep the faith.

499
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,585
I'll, uh, check on
the narco detective.

500
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:29,891
Control, please be advised

501
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:32,763
that we are still 10-6
at Shaw Memorial.

502
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:35,244
Was there, um, any updates
from the narcotics table?

503
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:36,941
<i>Negative.</i>

504
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:49,432
What are you watching?

505
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:50,694
Uh, just a TikTok.

506
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,523
Of our living room? Are --

507
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,438
Are you spying on Tamara?

508
00:18:55,482 --> 00:18:57,962
No! No. I'm just trying out
a home security system.

509
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,226
You are a lying liar who lies.

510
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:02,402
Okay. Fine.

511
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:06,057
My Swarovski Baby Yoda figurine
disappeared, okay?

512
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:07,581
Eh -- Okay. And so, what?

513
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:09,365
You installed a nanny cam

514
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:11,846
because you <i>think</i> she stole
your stupid toy?

515
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:14,370
Okay, two things --
it's not stupid --

516
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:16,155
it's amazing.

517
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,286
And it's not a toy --

518
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:20,420
It's a rare collectible
of sorts.

519
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:21,986
I can't believe
you would do this.

520
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,598
Look, Tamara would never
take advantage of us.

521
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:26,513
I know her. Eh, do you?

522
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:28,602
I mean, yeah, she seems like
a great person,

523
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:30,212
and I love that
you <i>want</i> to trust her,

524
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,040
but it doesn't really
change the fact

525
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:34,216
that she's been,
you know...
What?

526
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,871
...living on the streets.

527
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:38,655
There's no telling what
she had to do to survive.

528
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:40,831
Why didn't you
talk to me about this?

529
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,530
Why didn't you talk to me before
inviting the Artful Dodger

530
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:46,141
to live in <i>our</i> apartment?

531
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,447
Baby Yoda is missing.

532
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,232
No, he's not, okay? I broke him.

533
00:19:50,276 --> 00:19:52,191
It was an accident. I'm sorry.

534
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,323
I was gonna replace it
before you even noticed.

535
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:57,108
I never thought that you would
blame a traumatized teenager.

536
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:04,377
Where's my headset?

537
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,422
Officially, only I can listen,

538
00:20:06,466 --> 00:20:10,034
but I'm allowed to use
a translator if needed,

539
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,254
and my Spanish is
a little rusty today.

540
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,778
<i>Gracias.</i>

541
00:20:14,822 --> 00:20:16,345
Tomá<i> Mijo, when I am gone --</i>

542
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:17,216
<i>Come on...</i>

543
00:20:19,087 --> 00:20:21,394
<i>I don't want to go. Believe me.</i>

544
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:22,830
There's nothing illegal about

545
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,135
talking to your father
about dying.

546
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,528
We gotta turn it off.

547
00:20:25,572 --> 00:20:27,748
Hold on. We still got a minute.

548
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,799
<i>Who let you in here? Get out.</i>

549
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,368
<i>Señor Madrigal,
with all due respect,</i>

550
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:40,891
<i>I would like a word in private.</i>

551
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:44,286
Tomá <i>I admire your
persistence, Señora de la Cruz.</i>

552
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,027
<i>Mijo, please.</i>

553
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,071
<i>Papá, she has no business
here --</i>

554
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:48,725
<i>Cesar.</i>

555
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,771
<i> Out.</i>

556
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,387
<i>I don't wish to create trouble
between you and your son,</i>

557
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,911
<i>but it's important
that we speak.</i>

558
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:02,696
<i>I came here to ask for your...</i>

559
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:07,353
What the hell?

560
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:09,529
Hey. Turn that off.

561
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:11,879
- How much you gonna pay me?
- What?

562
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:13,489
The other lady --
she paid me to buff.

563
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,621
You gonna pay me to stop?

564
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:18,233
Shut it down. Now.

565
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,283
She knows we're up on a wire.

566
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,893
No doubt.
But with Madrigal dying,

567
00:21:25,936 --> 00:21:27,851
this conversation
has to happen today.

568
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:30,114
<i>I am aware of
my son's limitations,</i>

569
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:32,639
<i>as I'm sure you are aware
of your son's.</i>

570
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:34,423
<i>It's what we have in common.</i>

571
00:21:34,467 --> 00:21:35,816
<i>We are not like our sons.</i>

572
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:38,035
<i>It's a shame. Not necessa--</i>

573
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,777
That's time.

574
00:21:41,952 --> 00:21:43,650
Part of me feels bad
for those boys.

575
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:45,478
Their future was set
before they were even born.

576
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:47,610
It's not fair. Ugh.

577
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:49,308
Being pregnant
is giving me feelings.

578
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:55,836
So, uh, I went out
on a date with James.

579
00:21:55,879 --> 00:21:57,620
I thought you were into Alonzo,

580
00:21:57,664 --> 00:21:59,492
the guy from
the community center?

581
00:21:59,535 --> 00:22:02,190
Uh, community center guy
is James.

582
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:04,758
Alonzo is the guy that I hooked
up with on the camping trip.

583
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:06,368
Damn. I can't keep up.

584
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:07,761
Me, neither.

585
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:09,458
I was -- I was in a drought,
and now --

586
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:11,242
It's raining men.

587
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,984
I've always either been
in a relationship or married

588
00:22:14,028 --> 00:22:15,508
or undercover.

589
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,466
I don't know.
It's kinda fun having options.

590
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,688
And that's time.

591
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:27,650
<i>Perhaps your son's
talents could be put to use</i>

592
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:30,131
<i>in a less demanding field.</i>

593
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:32,089
<i>Does he play video games?</i>

594
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:34,396
Tomá<i> He's open to video games,</i>

595
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,051
<i>but can one earn a living
doing that?</i>

596
00:22:37,094 --> 00:22:41,142
<i>There are guys that make so
much money playing video games</i>

597
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:45,102
<i>that they never have a want
for the rest of their lives.</i>

598
00:22:45,146 --> 00:22:47,235
They're clearly not talking
about video games.

599
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:49,890
No, she's making a play to take
over Madrigal's drug operation

600
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:52,719
in exchange for
paying his son a royalty.

601
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:54,460
That's a baller move.

602
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:56,418
<i>How do I know I can trust you?</i>

603
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:59,987
<i>Because like you, I respect
the old ways of doing things.</i>

604
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,206
<i>And don't you want to
leave this life knowing</i>

605
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,384
<i>that no harm will ever befall
your only son?</i>

606
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,565
Looking everywhere for you.

607
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:13,827
- What happened?
- No, nothing.

608
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,871
He's -- He's still in surgery.

609
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:16,569
Abigail's just waiting
in the room.

610
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,658
I just --
I needed to stretch my legs.

611
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,964
No, I get it.
I get it. I get it.

612
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:23,880
So, how's, uh, Roger?

613
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:25,621
- You mean Andrew?
- Right, Andrew.

614
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:27,362
It's...

615
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,887
- It's Roger, isn't it?
- Is it?

616
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:36,153
Okay, so, I just hope maybe
Roger is being good to you.

617
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:37,459
Yeah, he is.

618
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:39,679
Okay. You deserve it.

619
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,291
What?

620
00:23:43,334 --> 00:23:46,207
You and me dating other people.

621
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,209
Right?
When does it stop being weird?

622
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:50,646
Maybe it won't.

623
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,083
I can't believe
we're back at a hospital.

624
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:59,263
It seems like both yesterday
and a million years ago

625
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:01,309
Henry went in
for his last surgery.

626
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:04,007
He's a fighter.

627
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:05,661
He's been fighting
since the day he was born.

628
00:24:05,705 --> 00:24:07,707
This is just another hill
for him to climb.

629
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,449
He's gonna be fine.
I can feel it.

630
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,059
Could you stop?

631
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:14,278
Stop what?

632
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:16,280
The compulsive optimism.

633
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:19,632
It's exhausting.

634
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:21,721
What do you mean?

635
00:24:21,764 --> 00:24:23,853
I-I never told you this...

636
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:29,903
...but every time our baby
went in for another surgery,

637
00:24:29,946 --> 00:24:32,166
I was convinced
we were going to lose him.

638
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,342
Sarah, I always felt
the opposite.

639
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,344
I know.

640
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:37,693
But I couldn't go there.

641
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:41,131
I had to protect myself,
every time,

642
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:43,525
in case.

643
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:45,701
It was like flipping a coin.

644
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:47,921
Another surgery, another flip.

645
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:49,575
And he always comes up heads.

646
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:50,967
But maybe this time he won't.

647
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:54,057
Maybe we should have opted
for the other surgery.

648
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:58,018
Maybe this will wind up being
the worst day of our lives.

649
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,236
Sarah...

650
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:02,892
I can't think like that.

651
00:25:02,936 --> 00:25:04,546
And I can't think like you.

652
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:09,420
I'm going back in.

653
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:11,031
- You coming?
- Right behind you.

654
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:14,077
I'm gonna get
a little more fresh air.

655
00:25:42,323 --> 00:25:44,978
Tomá <i>Selling video games
is a complicated business,</i>

656
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,589
<i>especially for someone
new to town.</i>

657
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,591
It's clear to us
that they're talking about

658
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:52,115
her taking over
<i>Ah, but I have made...</i>

659
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,856
...but a jury might not be able to get past all
the code. <i>...some crucial connections already.</i>

660
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,901
Luckily, they're gonna have to

661
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,424
get into the details
at some point.

662
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:59,035
There's no
second conversation. <i>You'd be surprised.</i>

663
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,341
This deal is getting made
today or not at all. <i>You know how strong
my market share already is.</i>

664
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:03,866
<i>I appreciate your diligence.</i>

665
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,957
<i>One cannot be too careful where
family and money collide.</i>

666
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,481
<i>But it's important to have
protection in place.</i>

667
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,920
<i>And a good lawyer is crucial.</i>

668
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:19,578
<i>Have you ever heard of...
Wesley Evers?</i>

669
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:24,017
<i>He's made some interesting
connections of his own.</i>

670
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,062
<i>I have someone vetting him
as we speak.</i>

671
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:27,542
That's a threat.

672
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,898
<i>Hello?
- Who is this?</i>

673
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,944
I'm a nurse in Dr. Etz's office.

674
00:26:37,987 --> 00:26:39,728
A patient's husband
left this phone here.

675
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:42,644
I'm the patient. And a cop.
Where did he go?

676
00:26:42,688 --> 00:26:44,994
I don't know, but he left
in a hurry with a detective.

677
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,040
A detective?
Wh-- Did you hear a name?

678
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,607
<i>No, but he said you sent him.</i>

679
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:54,134
You said Angela
needed to see me.

680
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:56,092
- Where is she?
- Just up here.

681
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:06,755
You're not a detective, are you?

682
00:27:10,063 --> 00:27:11,673
I was.

683
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:14,937
A long time ago, in Guatemala.

684
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:18,985
I was like your Angela --
so desperate to do good.

685
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:20,769
But so naive.

686
00:27:24,164 --> 00:27:26,601
I was made to understand
my failings the hard way.

687
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,950
Let's just hope your Angela

688
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:30,736
doesn't need to be
taught a lesson like I was.

689
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:36,306
Listen to me.

690
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,787
I have represented
hundreds of guys like you.

691
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:43,487
You all think
that you're pure evil

692
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,315
and willing to do
whatever your master asks,

693
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:47,709
but you don't know anything
about Angela or me.

694
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:52,932
If you hurt her,

695
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:57,110
I will call in every favor
I am owed,

696
00:27:57,153 --> 00:27:59,765
and there's a lot.

697
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:03,638
Rabid animals who will burn you
to your component molecules

698
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,335
while you beg me for mercy.

699
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,383
Do you hear me?

700
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,693
I love it.

701
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:17,130
Such passion.

702
00:28:17,173 --> 00:28:19,349
Let's just hope you never
have to follow through, huh?

703
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,054
Let's just hope your beloved

704
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:30,273
does the smart thing
for herself.

705
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,888
And for your baby.

706
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:42,764
See you soon, <i>amigo.</i>

707
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:50,293
If she hurts Wesley --She wouldn't dare.

708
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:52,295
It's too reckless,
even for La Fiera.

709
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:54,036
Alright, backup's on the way.

710
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,211
Security's scrubbing through
surveillance tapes.

711
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:56,212
We'll find them.

712
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:58,171
Oh, thank God.

713
00:28:58,214 --> 00:28:59,172
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

714
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:00,651
Are you?

715
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:02,523
Yeah. What happened?

716
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:04,177
I was just given
a not-so-subtle warning

717
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,482
from your favorite cartel boss.

718
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:06,788
Did they hurt you?

719
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:09,269
No, but they can and they will.

720
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:10,879
You should hand La Fiera off
to someone else,

721
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:13,142
at least until after the baby.

722
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,405
I can't do that.

723
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:18,234
Yes, you can.

724
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:19,714
I just threatened
to go medieval on some guy

725
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,542
if he even looks at you funny.

726
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:24,501
You did? Of course.

727
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:27,243
Is it bad that I'm a little
turned on right now?

728
00:29:27,287 --> 00:29:29,898
Angela, it's not funny.

729
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:31,857
I know.

730
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,989
But if you know anything about
me, it's that I don't back down,

731
00:29:34,033 --> 00:29:36,252
and La Fiera just
overplayed her hand.

732
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,472
Someone's happy.

733
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:40,082
Today is a good day.

734
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,344
Hey!

735
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:42,911
Angela.

736
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,521
You're about to get curb-stomped
by a pregnant lady.

737
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:46,262
Hey, hey, hey.
It's not worth it.

738
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:48,221
<i>Hermana.</i>

739
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:50,919
You know the baby feels
all the stress.

740
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,355
It's no good.

741
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,923
Maybe you should
take some time off.

742
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:57,012
Get some rest.

743
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:06,848
Think she bought it?

744
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:09,111
Please tell me you got something
while we were out of pocket.

745
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:11,461
Oh, yeah. They talked a lot
after you left.

746
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:13,724
See, we now have a recording
of La Fiera

747
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:16,292
making a deal to take over
Madrigal's operation.

748
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:18,599
- Yes.
- Don't get too excited.

749
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:20,906
It's just the first step
in making the case against her.

750
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:23,734
The DA can't just rely
on a cryptic conversation.

751
00:30:23,778 --> 00:30:25,780
But this will free up resources,

752
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,434
maybe even launch a task force.

753
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:28,870
Definitely.

754
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:30,785
And you'll want in, right?

755
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:34,223
Who hired you
to smuggle the drugs?

756
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,312
Technically, it was my idea.

757
00:30:39,141 --> 00:30:41,883
This has been a really bad year.

758
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:45,495
I lost my job,
had to drop out of school

759
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:46,888
because I couldn't
afford tuition.

760
00:30:46,932 --> 00:30:49,021
Then I heard about
this dude willing to pay

761
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:52,459
a small fortune
to move product to Ibiza, and...

762
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,550
It's just happy pills.

763
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:58,857
Like, who was it gonna hurt,
you know?

764
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:03,731
I'm so stupid.

765
00:31:03,774 --> 00:31:05,776
No, you just made a mistake.

766
00:31:07,474 --> 00:31:09,780
Look, I'm not gonna lie and say
you can get off scot-free,

767
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,566
but we can put in a word
with the D.A.

768
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,698
First offense,
intent to distribute --

769
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:15,830
it shouldn't be too bad.

770
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,136
You'd do that?

771
00:31:17,179 --> 00:31:19,616
<i>If</i> you tell us
who gave you the drugs

772
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,271
and agree to testify
against them.

773
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:24,970
Well, it just sounds like a
different way of possibly dying.

774
00:31:25,013 --> 00:31:26,928
Things can be done
to protect you.

775
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:30,801
Can I think about it?

776
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:32,760
You have until the drugs pass.

777
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:33,761
Uh, hey, hey!

778
00:31:33,804 --> 00:31:35,415
We need help in here! Nurse?

779
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:36,329
- Coming in.
- Yeah, we got her.

780
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:38,331
What's happening?

781
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:40,333
Could be an obstructed bowel, or
one of the drug packets broke.

782
00:31:40,376 --> 00:31:41,334
We gotta get her into surgery.

783
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:42,509
Alright. Let's go.

784
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:47,818
I can't believe you were my age
when Henry was born.

785
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,559
Babies having babies.

786
00:31:49,603 --> 00:31:51,561
Yeah, we were only married
a few months.

787
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:52,954
Remember the house
we were renting?

788
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:55,217
Oh, my God. You say "house."

789
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,219
I say "rotting wooden corpse."

790
00:31:57,263 --> 00:32:00,396
But you fixed it up,
worked 20-hour days

791
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,616
to get it all done in time
to bring Henry home.

792
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:04,618
Yeah, and then we spent
two months at the hospital.

793
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:07,708
Did you have any rituals
to help pass the time

794
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:10,319
while you waited like this
for the surgeries to be over?

795
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,843
I cried. John did push-ups.

796
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:14,280
Actually, I think that was
the other way around.

797
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:16,064
Oh, right, yeah.

798
00:32:16,108 --> 00:32:19,850
I got mad upper body strength
by the end of it.

799
00:32:19,894 --> 00:32:22,897
Henry didn't tell me
this could happen.

800
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,507
He mentioned the TOF,
but he acted like

801
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,031
it was all behind him.

802
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:28,772
I'm sure he believed it was.

803
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:32,820
Still, he owed you the truth.

804
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:35,605
You deserve to know
what you're signing up for.

805
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,391
I really hope I get to
tell him that.

806
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:45,311
I will, right?

807
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:46,965
He's gonna be okay?

808
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:52,666
Yes. He is.

809
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:03,894
Nice of you to see us off.

810
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,723
How's the knee?

811
00:33:06,767 --> 00:33:08,464
Doctor says it'll be a year
before I'm back out

812
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:10,597
on the <i>fútbol</i> pitch.

813
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,947
Don't skimp on
the physical therapy.

814
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,296
It's gonna suck,
but if you push through it,

815
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,558
you'll be glad you did.

816
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:17,038
Thanks.

817
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:18,997
Do you need a minute
with my mom?

818
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,128
30 seconds.

819
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:21,086
Okay.

820
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,918
Are you going to
threaten me again?

821
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:31,313
No. I'm gonna give you
one last chance --

822
00:33:31,357 --> 00:33:33,489
for Diego's sake.

823
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:36,144
Don't go through with this deal.

824
00:33:36,188 --> 00:33:37,580
Fly home with your son.

825
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:39,669
Take the money
you've already made

826
00:33:39,713 --> 00:33:41,671
and give him the life
he deserves,

827
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:44,283
not the one
you think you're owed.

828
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:46,415
<i>Hermana.</i>

829
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:49,897
In my line of work,
you don't get to retire.

830
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,335
There's no walking away,

831
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:55,424
even if I wanted to.

832
00:33:58,993 --> 00:34:01,735
Which I don't.

833
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:03,215
Gun!

834
00:34:03,258 --> 00:34:07,610
Diego!

835
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:09,656
Go, go, go!

836
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:33,288
Officer under fire.

837
00:34:33,332 --> 00:34:35,073
Parking garage, level four,
Shaw Memorial.

838
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,814
At least three shooters.
Send backup.

839
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:41,166
Diego, <i>por favor!</i>

840
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:43,385
You have to let me get to him.

841
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,213
You can't right now. You can't.

842
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:53,569
Oh.

843
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:09,629
I'll take these two.

844
00:35:09,672 --> 00:35:11,239
I got the big guy.

845
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:13,023
Not that big.

846
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:33,740
Aah!

847
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:37,352
Control, 7-Adam-19,
two in custody,

848
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:38,310
one active shooter remaining.

849
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:39,920
We need an RA.

850
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:41,269
Hispanic male,
gunshot wound to the torso.

851
00:35:41,313 --> 00:35:42,575
Conscious and breathing.

852
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,279
Drop the gun.

853
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:52,715
Do it now.

854
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,850
Arms out.

855
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,157
Last suspect in custody. Code 4.

856
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:10,124
No!

857
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,868
Ahhhh!

858
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:20,526
So... And it was supposed to be
my day off.

859
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:22,005
No good deed, sir.

860
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:24,182
Any luck locating
Cesar Madrigal?

861
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,619
Not yet. Odds are
he's gone to ground.

862
00:36:26,662 --> 00:36:27,924
It's not gonna help.

863
00:36:27,968 --> 00:36:29,230
He took a shot at the Queen
and missed.

864
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:30,753
Yeah, well...

865
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,669
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

866
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:35,628
You can't come
into the crime scene.

867
00:36:47,814 --> 00:36:50,120
When will I have
my son's body to bury?

868
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:51,687
In a few days.

869
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:53,646
After the autopsy.

870
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:03,699
Her son was her humanity.
With him gone...

871
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:05,745
War is coming.

872
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:11,403
<i>Angels West. How can I help you?</i>

873
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:13,405
