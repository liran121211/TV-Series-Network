1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,829
Previously on "The Rookie"...I'm gonna give you my car.

2
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:05,179
What's the catch?You have to keep checking in

3
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:06,745
with me until you're off
the street, or no deal.

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,270
-Thanks.
-Hey!

5
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:11,402
I am hereby placing you
under administrative leave.

6
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:12,925
Gun and badge.

7
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:14,536
Guys like Doug Stanton
should not be training

8
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:15,667
our next generation.

9
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:16,886
If you had
your college degree,

10
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,193
you would be able to be T.O.
in two years.

11
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:20,107
Looks like
I'm going back to school.

12
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:23,762
♪♪

13
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:25,938
Thanks for letting me
do my laundry here.

14
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:28,637
I swear my cousin's dryer
is possessed.

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,117
Any time.

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,075
Plus, it means I get to
make sure

17
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,078
you have avegetable
this month.

18
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:37,428
I told you -- all the cool kids
are getting scurvy.

19
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:38,908
Mm-hmm.
Listen --

20
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:40,605
I have to write a paper
for school

21
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,825
about gender roles
in the workplace,

22
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:44,348
and I'm supposed to
interview someone

23
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,916
who's working a job that was
traditionally considered male.

24
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:51,529
And you want to
interview...me?

25
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:52,617
If you're not busy.

26
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,663
I would be honored.

27
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:56,491
If you're gonna make this weird,
I'll just ask someone else.

28
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:58,145
No! I'm in.
We can --

29
00:00:58,188 --> 00:00:59,407
We can do it after dinner
tonight.

30
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,365
I still have to get
the questions together.

31
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:03,106
Okay. Well, how about
tomorrow night?

32
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,847
I could pick you up
after my shift?

33
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,110
I should be done on time
for once.

34
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:09,591
My sergeant has us doing
site security

35
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:11,201
for the CCOA convention.

36
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:14,552
It's the California Covert
Operators Association.

37
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,511
Undercover cops
have a convention?

38
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:18,687
Yeah. At a hotel,
if you can believe it.

39
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,255
And it's advertised
on their website, so...

40
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,213
Well, sounds like
the opposite of covert.

41
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:24,693
Yeah, that's what I said.

42
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,217
But I guess it's a space for
them to share trade secrets.

43
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,914
And party
on the city's dime.

44
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,655
While we make sure no bad guys
get close enough

45
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:32,048
to ID an undercover cop.

46
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,528
Well, sadly,
I'll be missing the fun

47
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:36,270
because I'll be working
the Community Policing Center

48
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:37,662
with Smitty tomorrow.

49
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:40,883
Ah. Only 10 more days
until no more T.O.s.

50
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:43,320
Mm.

51
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:44,756
Hey.

52
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,237
I thought you were starting
college classes tonight.

53
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,717
Nolan: I'm actually just about
to head into

54
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,675
my Ethics and Criminal Law
class.

55
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,460
But I'm having
second thoughts about

56
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:54,723
identifying myself
as a police officer.

57
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,072
I mean, I should, right?

58
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:56,812
No.No.Yeah.

59
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,553
That's...not helpful.

60
00:01:58,596 --> 00:01:59,684
Why shouldn't you?

61
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:01,121
Because it'll isolate him right away.

62
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:03,688
You think I introduce myself
as homeless at school?

63
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:06,213
Unless you want the class
to be about you,

64
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,910
I'd keep your head downand blend in.

65
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,738
Good evening.
I'm Professor Ryan,

66
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,306
and this is
Ethics and Criminal Justice.

67
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,613
Now, tell me, what do
those words make you think?

68
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:19,356
That...the two don't gotogether.
Why?

69
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,099
Because the criminal justice
system is inherently biased,

70
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,623
designed to punish poor people
and people of color.

71
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,190
Okay, so if that's a problem,
what is a solution?

72
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,366
Defund the police,
for starters.

73
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,107
Anyone disagree?

74
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,240
Uh, well, I don't think
it's quite that simple --

75
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,067
just defunding the police.

76
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,418
Defunding doesn't mean
get rid of cops.

77
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,897
It means
stop prioritizing them

78
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,116
over people
they're supposed to serve.

79
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,510
Yeah, no, I appreciate that,
and I agree.

80
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:45,208
I think a lot more money needs
to be invested in communities,

81
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:47,993
but it will take time
for those investments

82
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:49,908
to effect any realchange.

83
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:52,520
If we drastically cut policing
before that happens,

84
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:54,696
it would leave people
unprotected.

85
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,567
It can't be worse
than it is now.

86
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,439
Sure, it can.

87
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:00,005
Don't you agree?

88
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:02,573
Oh, I'm not here to agree
or to pick sides.

89
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,314
Ethics are often at odds
with the law.

90
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:05,968
What's right
and what is legal

91
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,405
are very often
all too different.

92
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:12,279
And that tension is what
we are here to explore.

93
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:14,672
And it is going to get
uncomfortable,

94
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:16,761
so y'all better strap in.

95
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:20,243
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
whoa, oh, oh ♪

00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,593

98
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,295
By then,
the class had ended,

99
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:29,731
and I still hadn't
identified myself.

100
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:31,298
Did I make a mistake?

101
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:33,038
I can't answer that
for you.

102
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,475
As a cop, you have to judge
social situations

103
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:35,998
on a case-by-case basis.

104
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,566
I just hate the feeling
like I'm hiding something.

105
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,482
Allof these people can't be
undercover cops, can they?

106
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:42,874
Okay, so, think of
the undercover world

107
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,267
like high school, right?

108
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,573
So, first,
you have your UCs.

109
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:47,270
They are like
the star quarterbacks.

110
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:48,924
No undercover operation
can happen without them,

111
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,794
and they know it.

112
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:50,752
They take
the most risk,

113
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:52,406
and they reap
the most reward.

114
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:53,885
Meaning?
They get laid.

115
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:54,930
A lot.
Oh.

116
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:56,888
Then you have
your Case Officers.

117
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:58,238
They're like
the debate team.

118
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,630
They think they're smarter
than everyone else,

119
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,806
and they see themselves
as puppet masters

120
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,374
who use UCs as just a tool
in their kit.

121
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,158
I'm guessing they don't get laid
near as much.

122
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,509
Correct. Then you have
your Tech Squad.

123
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,032
They're like the hackers.

124
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:11,207
They basically aresmarter
than everyone else,

125
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,861
but they have
a real criminal streak.

126
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,906
They commit legal burglaries
and break-ins,

127
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,256
planting
cameras and bugs.

128
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,170
Finally,
you have your Freshmen.

129
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:20,477
They're easily identifiable.
Just off patrol.

130
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,087
Still at
that awkward stage

131
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:23,524
of trying to let
their hair grow out,

132
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,482
where they're
mullet-adjacent.

133
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,005
So youwere
a star quarterback.

134
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:30,661
Oh, baby,
I was the Heisman Trophy.

135
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:33,055
Lucy: Alright, thanks.
You're good to go.

136
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,883
Hey, do you work the convention
every year?

137
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:37,059
No. L.A. hasn't hosted onein a long time.

138
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,234
But I did go
with Isabel once.

139
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,409
What kind of classes
do they teach?

140
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:40,889
No idea.

141
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,326
Patrol isn't allowed to know
UC trade secrets.

142
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,937
So I just ordered room service,worked on my tan.

143
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,635

Michael has drama club.

196
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,131
That will attract rodents.

197

204
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:47,581
Of course. That's notwhat
we're looking for.

205
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:50,061
Look, I can call the cityand have them tow away the Aspen

206
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:51,454
so Sally can get to work.

207
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:52,673
Is there anything else
we can help you with?

208
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:55,284
Um, I've actually
made a list of potholes,

209
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,460
and they can cause accidents,
car damage.

210
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:59,157
But the Bureau
of Street Services

211
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,594

212
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:03,510

216
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,996
No.

217
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,433

there could be trouble

00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,063
I'm scheduled to teach
a seminar this morning,

229

230
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,239
Can you fill in for me?

235
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,509

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,209

Uh, sure.

239
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,733
Thanks.
I'll text you the details.

You are the best.

241
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,345
What's the seminar on?

242
00:07:56,388 --> 00:08:00,131
Women make up just 12%
of law enforcement.

243
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:04,048
But they're attacked almosttwice as often as male officers.

244
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:06,921
And yet, male officers are

245
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:09,489
three times more likely
to fire their weapon,

246
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:13,014
they are three times more likelyto get injured while on duty,

247
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:17,105
and they make up 95%
of citizen complaints.

248
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,934
Which begs the question,
are women just better cops?

249
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,588
Oh, you better believe it.

250
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,289
You're not supposed to be
listening.

251
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:28,899
Why? 'Cause they don't
trust patrol

252
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,379

Secret Squirrel stuff?

And I'm already on thin ice,
so I'm outta here.

255
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,473
This seminar today is about
being a female undercover cop

256
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,562
and the unique risks
that that poses.

257
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:43,305

the best stories.

Oh, come on.
Give us one.

354
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:32,099
I've only been
a year on the job.

355
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:33,622
I've never seen
any real action.

356
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:36,973
Alright, well, this one time,
a couple years back,

357
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:38,714
I get in with
this biker gang,

358
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,021
and we're movin'
a hell-ton'a smack.

359
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:42,936
Now, the buyer,
he smells a rat,

360
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,981
and suddenly, I've got
six sawed-off shotties

361
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:46,591
right to my grill.
Mm.

362
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,376
They wanted me to try the batch,
make sure it wasn't bunk.

363
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,638
What'd you do?

364
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:50,813
Man, I got high
as the Hindenburg

365
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,119
and came down
just as messy.

366
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,598
Sorry. Wrong answer.

367
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,342
Ah.

368
00:12:58,386 --> 00:12:59,648
Real undercover cops
don't behave

369
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:01,432

Thanks for the assist.Ah, no problem.

374
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,704
I was giving a talk at
the local elementary school.

375
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,402
Yeah, I gotta admit,

376
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,926
I've actually never seen
a cop on a horse before.

377

388
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:42,517
No, but she lives in
stall number 11.

389
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,910
Uh, how's patrol?

390

I'm in a bind.

527
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,410
Look, the real reason

528
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,672
I couldn't make
the convention today

529
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:29,847
is because
I spotted a tail

530
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:30,892
on my way down
from Sacramento.

531
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:32,850
Who? I think it's the buyer

532
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,156
in this op
I've been running.

533
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,244
They're sniffing around
a big batch

534
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:36,593
of liquid Fentanyl
I'm selling.

535
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:37,812
And you think
they're onto you?

536
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,988
I think there's
a lot of money in play

537
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:41,076
and they're paranoid as hell.

538
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,860
Are they still
surveilling you?

539
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,166
Yeah,
I couldn't lose them.

540
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,647
I think they put a tracker
on my car.

541
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,214
Look, I'm at The Smoke House
in Burbank,

542
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:49,519
but my whole team's
up in San Jose.

What are you driving?

544
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,697
Black Mustang GT.
They know me as Coco.

Sorry.

Well, I saw it
on his application

559
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,028
when he signed up
for my class.

560
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,334
And you didn't tell us?

561
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:23,553
Oh, it wasn't
my decision to make.

00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:24,902
How can you say that?

563
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,165
Cops have been spying
on people like us

564
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,601
for 200 years.

565
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:29,907
He could be taking this class
to get close to us,

566
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,648
to get into LULAC
or Black Lives Matter.

567
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,172

just a rookie.

00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,568
I'm not.
Um...

571
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:41,615
Two years ago, I was working
construction back east.

572
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:43,530
I moved out here
to join the police

573
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:45,009
and make a difference.

574
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:47,969
I'm actually taking this class
to finally get my degree.

575
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:51,320
It's true.
I read his transcript.

576
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:53,453
Plus, do you really think
the LAPD's gonna send

577
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:56,064
a 40-something-year-old
white guy to infiltrate BLM?

578
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,848
Come on, now.Probably not.

579
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,720
He still should have
told us he's a cop.

Hmm.

Who here thinks that John
is ethically obligated

582
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:05,769
to identify himself?

583
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,031

00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,642
Why?

585
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:10,948
This is supposed to be
a safe space.

586
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:12,123
What if one of us
admitted to a crime

587
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,603
in the middle of
a discussion?

588
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,257
Well, then,
you'd be stupid.

589
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,216
There are no
truly safe spaces --

in a college classroom.

I, uh,
was wrestling with

whether or not to tell you
last night, and...

what the right decision is.

Okay, well,

598
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,367
an ethical obligation
to tell us he's a cop.

She'll be joining Harper

737
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,962
This is Sergeant June Zhang
of Fresno PD.

My case officer,
Lieutenant Balasco,

742
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:22,972
who is not nearly as mean
and awful as he looks.

743
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:24,452
For the last eight months,

744
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,976
I have been up on a crew
out of San Jose who made bank

745
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,326
selling precursors of
liquid Fentanyl.

746
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,677
But they got greedy, tried to go
from selling the parts

747
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,070
to making and selling
the finished product.

748
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:36,072
But their lab blew up,
killing their chemist

749
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:37,639
and destroying
their entire supply,

750
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:40,686
leaving them with no product
and a lot of pissed-off buyers.

751
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:43,340
Which is when I swooped in,
promising enough product

752
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,473
to satisfy all their customers
and then some.

753
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:48,302
But last night, all our
hard work almost fell apart,

754
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:52,175
until the quick thinking
of Officer Chen saved my ass.

755
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,829
Chen, stand up so they can
see what you're wearing.

756
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:56,527
Yeah.The op today is simple.

00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:59,139
Trade drugs for cash,
then arrest everybody

758
00:26:59,182 --> 00:27:02,098
and try to get them to flip on
Aldo Salonga, their boss.

759
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:03,796

You have your assignment.

What the hell
are you doing?

762
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,455
You can't pit an
untrained probationary officer

Yeah. I do.

1055
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,467
Everyone in this classroom
wants to change the system,

1056
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:30,558
and they're driven by hope
and a ton of anger.

1057
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:33,605
But hope is what keeps them
moving forward.

1058
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:34,954
So if they see that
you're serious

1059
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:36,695
about being part of
the change,

1060
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:39,437
they'll let you back in.

1061
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,264
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

1062

♪ The beginning

1063
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:43,919
That's so -- I --

1064
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:45,051
I should've
written that down.

1065
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:46,269
What was the part
in the beginning,

1066
00:40:46,313 --> 00:40:48,010
when you said that...

1067
00:40:48,054 --> 00:40:49,272
You know what?
I -- I got it.

1068
00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:51,449
It's -- Thank you very much.
It's good stuff.

1069
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:56,279
Oh, and they always want us
to go undercover as strippers.

1070
00:40:56,323 --> 00:40:57,542
Harper: Yes!

1071
00:40:57,585 --> 00:40:59,544
As if our bodies are
the only thing we have.

1072
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:01,023
Yes.
Well, actually,

1073
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:03,722
my -- my body does have
magical powers,

1074
00:41:03,765 --> 00:41:06,725
butit does,
a lot of the times,

1075
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:10,468
feel like, as a female UC,
that they just want to

1076
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:13,209
get you naked
for the guys in the van.

1077
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:15,429
Mm-hmm, so that they can
drool over you

1078
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,127
in a cloud of their own farts.

1079
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:20,303
I don't think I can use
any of this for my paper.

1080
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:21,522
Okay. Alright.

1081
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:23,306
What -- What exactly
do you need to know?

1082
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,179
Women have been cops

1083
00:41:26,222 --> 00:41:28,834
in the LAPD
over 100 years now,

1084
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:30,836
but does it still feel like
you have to act like a man

1085
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,838
to fit in?Good question.

1086
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:35,188
Well, you're the rookie,
the last one in.

1087
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:36,537
What do you think?

1088
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:38,626
Um...

1089
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:41,194
Mm, I think...

1090
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:43,544
I think fitting in
is a trap.

1091
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:47,461
I'm sitting between two of
the best cops in the state...

1092
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,855
Mm....who had to navigate

1093
00:41:49,898 --> 00:41:53,772
an avalanche of obstacles
just to get to the mountaintop.

1094
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:55,338
They didn't do it
by trying to fit in.

1095
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:58,124
They did it by --
you know, by, um...

1096
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:02,432
being stronger, smarter,
more agile.

1097
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:05,261
They had to to navigate
a system that still believes

1098
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:08,047
being a girl is inherently
soft or weak,

1099
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,224
as though empathy
is somehow a liability.

1100
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,531
There isn't a guy
in the force

1101
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:16,142
who can do what these guys
can do.
Mm.

1102
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:18,274
And there sure as hell
isn't anyone tougher.

1103
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:19,754
Hoo!
I will drink to that.

1104
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:20,755
Hell yeah.
