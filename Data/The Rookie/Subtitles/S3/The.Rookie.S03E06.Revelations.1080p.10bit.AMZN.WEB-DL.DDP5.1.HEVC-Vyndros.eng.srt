1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,829
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...I'm
gonna give you my car.</i>

2
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:05,179
- What's the catch?
- You have to keep checking in

3
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:06,745
with me until you're off
the street, or no deal.

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,270
- Thanks.
- Hey!

5
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:11,402
I am hereby placing you
under administrative leave.

6
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:12,925
Gun and badge.

7
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:14,536
Guys like Doug Stanton
should not be training

8
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:15,667
our next generation.

9
00:00:15,711 --> 00:00:16,886
If you had your college degree,

10
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,193
you would be able to be T.O.
in two years.

11
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:20,107
Looks like
I'm going back to school.

12
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:25,938
Thanks for letting me
do my laundry here.

13
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:28,637
I swear my cousin's dryer
is possessed.

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,117
Any time.

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,075
Plus, it means I get to
make sure

16
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,078
you have <i>a</i> vegetable this month.

17
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:37,428
I told you -- all the cool kids
are getting scurvy.

18
00:00:37,472 --> 00:00:38,908
Mm-hmm. Listen --

19
00:00:38,951 --> 00:00:40,605
I have to write a paper
for school

20
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,825
about gender roles
in the workplace,

21
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:44,348
and I'm supposed to
interview someone

22
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,916
who's working a job that was
traditionally considered male.

23
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:51,529
And you want to interview... me?

24
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:52,617
If you're not busy.

25
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,663
I would be honored.

26
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:56,491
If you're gonna make this weird,
I'll just ask someone else.

27
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:58,145
No! I'm in. We can --

28
00:00:58,188 --> 00:00:59,407
We can do it after dinner
tonight.

29
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,365
I still have to get
the questions together.

30
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:03,106
Okay. Well, how about
tomorrow night?

31
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:04,847
I could pick you up
after my shift?

32
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,110
I should be done on time
for once.

33
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:09,591
My sergeant has us doing
site security

34
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:11,201
for the CCOA convention.

35
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:14,552
It's the California Covert
Operators Association.

36
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:16,511
Undercover cops
have a convention?

37
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:18,687
Yeah. At a hotel,
if you can believe it.

38
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,255
And it's advertised
on their website, so...

39
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,213
Well, sounds like
the opposite of covert.

40
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:24,693
Yeah, that's what I said.

41
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,217
But I guess it's a space for
them to share trade secrets.

42
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,914
And party on the city's dime.

43
00:01:28,958 --> 00:01:30,655
While we make sure no bad guys
get close enough

44
00:01:30,699 --> 00:01:32,048
to ID an undercover cop.

45
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,528
Well, sadly,
I'll be missing the fun

46
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:36,270
because I'll be working
the Community Policing Center

47
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:37,662
with Smitty tomorrow.

48
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:40,883
Ah. Only 10 more days
until no more T.O.S.

49
00:01:40,926 --> 00:01:43,320
Mm.

50
00:01:43,364 --> 00:01:44,756
Hey.

51
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,237
I thought you were starting
college classes tonight.

52
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:48,717
I'm actually just about
to head into

53
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,675
my Ethics and Criminal Law
class.

54
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,460
But I'm having
second thoughts about

55
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:54,723
identifying myself
as a police officer.

56
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,072
<i>I mean, I should, right?</i>

57
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:56,812
--No. -No.
-Yeah.

58
00:01:56,855 --> 00:01:58,553
That's... not helpful.

59
00:01:58,596 --> 00:01:59,684
<i>Why shouldn't you?</i>

60
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:01,121
<i>Because it'll isolate him right away.</i>

61
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:03,688
You think I introduce myself
as homeless at school?

62
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:06,213
Unless you want the class
to be about you,

63
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,910
I'd keep your head down and blend in.

64
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,738
Good evening.
I'm Professor Ryan,

65
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,306
and this is
Ethics and Criminal Justice.

66
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,613
Now, tell me, what do
those words make you think?

67
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:19,356
That... the two don't go together.
Why?

68
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,099
Because the criminal justice
system is inherently biased,

69
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,623
designed to punish poor people
and people of color.

70
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,190
Okay, so if that's a problem,
what is a solution?

71
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,366
Defund the police, for starters.

72
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,107
Anyone disagree?

73
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,240
Uh, well, I don't think
it's quite that simple --

74
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,067
just defunding the police.

75
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:37,418
Defunding doesn't mean
get rid of cops.

76
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,897
It means stop prioritizing them

77
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,116
over people
they're supposed to serve.

78
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,510
Yeah, no, I appreciate that,
and I agree.

79
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:45,208
I think a lot more money needs
to be invested in communities,

80
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:47,993
but it will take time
for those investments

81
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:49,908
to effect any <i>real</i> change.

82
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:52,520
If we drastically cut policing
before that happens,

83
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:54,696
it would leave people
unprotected.

84
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,567
It can't be worse
than it is now.

85
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:58,439
Sure, it can.

86
00:02:58,482 --> 00:03:00,005
Don't you agree?

87
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:02,573
Oh, I'm not here to agree
or to pick sides.

88
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,314
Ethics are often at odds
with the law.

89
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:05,968
What's right and what is legal

90
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,405
are very often
all too different.

91
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:12,279
And that tension is what
we are here to explore.

92
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:14,672
And it is going to get
uncomfortable,

93
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:16,761
so y'all better strap in.

94
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:20,243
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
whoa, oh, oh ♪

95
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,593
♪ I'm gonna win for you

96
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:26,510
♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪

97
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,295
By then, the class had ended,

98
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:29,731
and I still hadn't
identified myself.

99
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:31,298
Did I make a mistake?

100
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:33,038
I can't answer that for you.

101
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:34,475
As a cop, you have to judge
social situations

102
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:35,998
on a case-by-case basis.

103
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,566
I just hate the feeling
like I'm hiding something.

104
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,482
<i>All</i> of these people can't be
undercover cops, can they?

105
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:42,874
Okay, so, think of
the undercover world

106
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:44,267
like high school, right?

107
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,573
So, first, you have your UCs.

108
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:47,270
They are like
the star quarterbacks.

109
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:48,924
No undercover operation
can happen without them,

110
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,794
and they know it.

111
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:50,752
They take the most risk,

112
00:03:50,795 --> 00:03:52,406
and they reap the most reward.

113
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:53,885
Meaning? They get laid.

114
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:54,930
A lot. Oh.

115
00:03:54,973 --> 00:03:56,888
Then you have
your Case Officers.

116
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:58,238
They're like the debate team.

117
00:03:58,281 --> 00:03:59,630
They think they're smarter
than everyone else,

118
00:03:59,674 --> 00:04:01,806
and they see themselves
as puppet masters

119
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,374
who use UCs as just a tool
in their kit.

120
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,158
I'm guessing they don't get laid
near as much.

121
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,509
Correct. Then you have
your Tech Squad.

122
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,032
They're like the hackers.

123
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:11,207
They basically <i>are</i> smarter
than everyone else,

124
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,861
but they have
a real criminal streak.

125
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:14,906
They commit legal burglaries
and break-ins,

126
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,256
planting cameras and bugs.

127
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,170
Finally, you have your Freshmen.

128
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:20,477
They're easily identifiable.
Just off patrol.

129
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,087
Still at that awkward stage

130
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:23,524
of trying to let
their hair grow out,

131
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:25,482
where they're mullet-adjacent.

132
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,005
So <i>you</i> were a star quarterback.

133
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:30,661
Oh, baby,
I was the Heisman Trophy.

134
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:33,055
Alright, thanks.
You're good to go.

135
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,883
Hey, do you work the convention
every year?

136
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:37,059
No. L.A. hasn't hosted one in a long time.

137
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,234
But I did go with Isabel once.

138
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,409
What kind of classes
do they teach?

139
00:04:39,453 --> 00:04:40,889
No idea.

140
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,326
Patrol isn't allowed to know
UC trade secrets.

141
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,937
So I just ordered room
service, worked on my tan.

142
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,635

Yeah.

157
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,017
- Notice what?
- Your pupils, man.

158
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,323
They're pinpoints.

You're looking 5-50.

00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:58,532
Aaron and Michael tutoring tomorrow night?

177
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:00,925
Just Aaron.
Michael has drama club.

178
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:03,145
- That boy's such a ham.
- I love him.

179
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:04,625
- Who's this?
- This is Silas.

180
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:06,061
Silas, good to meet you.

181
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,150
I'm, uh, Jackson,
and this is Smitty.

182
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:10,326
Jackson. Last name West.

183
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,545
Badge number, please?
For my records.

184
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:14,591
3-3-3-5-6.

185
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:16,637
Badge number?

186
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,769
2-8-7-1-7.

187
00:06:18,813 --> 00:06:19,944
First name, please.

188
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,206
Smitty's sufficient.

189
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,513
Silas is the eyes and
ears of the neighborhood.

190
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:25,515
He does a daily patrol,
gives me a heads-up

191
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:27,212
on problems that need fixing.

192
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:28,431
Anything we should know about?

193
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:29,998
Well, City Sanitation
neglected to empty

194
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,608
the Dumpster
in front of Matteo's Deli.

195
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,131
That will attract rodents.

196
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,090
And a Cadet Blue
1978 Dodge Aspen

197
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,657
is blocking
Sally Nelson's driveway,

198
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,658
and she has work at 10:00.

199
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:39,268
Kid would make a good CI.

200
00:06:39,311 --> 00:06:40,661
Forget it.

201
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,706
Silas is here because he
wants to help his neighbors,

202
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,491
not make it easier for you to hassle them.

203
00:06:44,534 --> 00:06:47,581
Of course. That's <i>not</i> what
we're looking for.

204
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:50,061
Look, I can call the city and
have them tow away the Aspen

205
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:51,454
so Sally can get to work.

206
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:52,673
Is there anything else
we can help you with?

207
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:55,284
Um, I've actually
made a list of potholes,

208
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,460
and they can cause accidents,
car damage.

209
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:59,157
But the Bureau
of Street Services

210
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,594
doesn't return
my telephone calls.

211
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:03,510
Smitty, doesn't your uncle
work for City Services?

212
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,599
Ugh -- Artie. Yes.

213
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:07,557
Guy is <i>such</i> a slacker.

214
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:10,299
Can you call him
about the potholes?

215
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,996
No.

216
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,433
I owe him money.

217
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,695
Okay, fine.

218
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:16,000
Give me the number,
and I'll call.

219
00:07:16,044 --> 00:07:17,262
Do you really think
there could be trouble

220
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:18,002
at this convention?

221
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:19,264
Absolutely.

222
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:21,441
Criminals would kill to
infiltrate this place.

223
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:23,617
The damage that undercover operations do

224
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,314
to their business is incredible.

225
00:07:29,492 --> 00:07:31,494
June! Wh-- Are you here?

226
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,496
<i>Oh, good.
You're at the convention.</i>

227
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,063
<i>I'm scheduled to teach
a seminar this morning,</i>

228
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:35,933
<i>but I can't get there.</i>

229
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:37,239
<i>Can you fill in for me?</i>

230
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:38,501
<i>It's the same class
you used to teach.</i>

231
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:39,459
<i>You could do it in your sleep.</i>

232
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,504
- I can't.
- I'm working security.

233
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:44,333
<i>Please. You still owe me
from that op in Bakersfield,</i>

234
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,509
<i>and you know I wouldn't ask
if I didn't have to.</i>

235
00:07:46,553 --> 00:07:47,858
Go ahead. I got this covered.

236
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:49,425
Go ahead.

237
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,209
Okay. Uh, sure.

238
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,733
<i>Thanks.
I'll text you the details.</i>

239
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:53,908
<i>You are the best.</i>

240
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,345
What's the seminar on?

241
00:07:56,388 --> 00:08:00,131
Women make up just 12%
of law enforcement.

242
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:04,048
But they're attacked almost twice
as often as male officers.

243
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:06,921
And yet, male officers are

244
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:09,489
three times more likely
to fire their weapon,

245
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:13,014
they are three times more
likely to get injured while on duty,

246
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:17,105
and they make up 95%
of citizen complaints.

247
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,934
Which begs the question,
are women just better cops?

248
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,588
Oh, you better believe it.

249
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,289
You're not supposed to be
listening.

250
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:28,899
Why? 'Cause they don't
trust patrol

251
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,379
with all their
Secret Squirrel stuff?

252
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:32,381
It doesn't matter why.
Rules are rules.

253
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:34,557
And I'm already on thin ice,
so I'm outta here.

254
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:37,473
This seminar today is about
being a female undercover cop

255
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,562
and the unique risks
that that poses.

256
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:43,305
Now, I will warn you, this is
not gonna be an easy ride.

257
00:08:43,348 --> 00:08:46,917
Some of what you're about to see
is hard to watch.

258
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:50,399
But if we can learn from the UCs
who died in these videos,

259
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:53,402
then maybe
we can save some lives.

260
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:55,012
Are you with me?

261
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:01,453
Chen. Yes?

262
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:03,151
Thought you were running
to the bathroom.

263
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:05,327
I was. I am.

264
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,067
Sorry.

265
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:13,553
Next time he calls
about potholes,

266
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:14,728
take it seriously, okay?

267
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:17,818
Yes, I work with Smitty.

268
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:21,386
Yeah. No.
No, I-I <i>won't</i> tell him that.

269
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,997
Because it's disgusting.

270
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,086
No! No! No! No!

271
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:27,088
No! No!

272
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:30,047
My baby's in the back!

273
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,440
7-Adam-07, carjacking,

274
00:09:31,483 --> 00:09:33,747
suspect headed westbound
on Fourth near Waverly.

275
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,618
I'm on foot.
I need any unit in the area.

276
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,241
♪ Whacha got, whatcha got?

277
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:52,853

278
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:54,202

279
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,507
I guess you didn't need
that assist after all.

280
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:56,944
You're...?

281
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:59,642
A cop on a horse? Yep.

282
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:00,730
Any other suspects?

283
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:03,515
No. Can you watch him?

284
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,865
Victim said her baby
was in the car.

285
00:10:04,908 --> 00:10:07,868
♪ Like an A-list star

286
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:09,652

287
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,915
Ma'am, <i>that's</i> your baby?

288
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:12,916
Yeah.

289
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,440
Oh!

290
00:10:15,484 --> 00:10:16,485
Oh, I'm sorry.

291
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:19,227
So you were spying
on one of the seminars?

292
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,490
No.

293
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:23,753
Maybe a little bit.

294
00:10:23,797 --> 00:10:25,755
I mean, what's the big deal?
I'm a cop, too.

295
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,496
The likelihood
of patrol officers

296
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:28,671
getting fired or flaming out

297
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,064
are much higher
than ranked officers.

298
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:32,719
The information and tactics
the CCOA present

299
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:35,069
are so unique and so sensitive,

300
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:36,897
they're literally
on a need-to-know basis.

301
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,899
Got it?

302
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:40,552
Yeah.

303
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,686
Tim? Beth.

304
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,209
I'm here to surprise Mack.

305
00:10:45,253 --> 00:10:46,950
He's barely been home
the last three months.

306
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,561
I bet. Yeah, undercover work's
a full-time gig.

307
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,780
Is he here yet?

308
00:10:52,173 --> 00:10:54,654
Yeah. He rolled through
a few hours ago.

309
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:55,611
It's great seeing you.

310
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,873
You, too.

311
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,050
Seriously?

312
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,312
You're not gonna give her
a heads-up?

313
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:04,315
No way I'm getting
in the middle of that.

314
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,274
Tim. Check this out.

315
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:08,711
Those cars belong to
the undercover cops.

316
00:11:08,755 --> 00:11:09,930
Well, they'll have
switched-out license plates

317
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,018
so criminals can't ID them.

318
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:13,803
But they can't cover
the VIN numbers.

319
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,892
If he gets those numbers,
he'll be able to identify them.

320
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:17,720
Gun. Back pocket.

321
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,635
Hey! Police! Hold up!

322
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:32,692
All units, be advised,
we have a perimeter breach.

323
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,824
White male, blue ballcap,
gray jacket, blue jeans.

324
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:36,347
Made it in through
the south rear door.

325
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:37,827
Armed with a handgun,
and may be targeting police.

326
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:43,050
He won't get far.
Hotel's on lockdown,

327
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:44,094
and his description
just went out

328
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:45,922
to 200 armed police officers.

329
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,924
Really, he's trapped
in here with us.

330
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,753
Yeah, that description's
useless now.

331
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,887
Be advised, our suspect
no longer has on

332
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,976
a ballcap or jacket.

333
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,893
Which means we are searching for
a white guy in blue jeans.

334
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,725
Do you see that?

335
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:07,770
Yeah, that could be our guy.
Could just be a twitchy UC.

336
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,164
They're hardwired to avoid
uniformed cops.

337
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:12,601
You think you can tell if he's
a cop just by talking to him?

338
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:13,950
Is that a challenge? Yep.

339
00:12:16,474 --> 00:12:17,388
How's it going?

340
00:12:17,432 --> 00:12:18,738
Ah.

341
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:22,306
Here for the convention?

342
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,917
I'm not really supposed to say.

343
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,614
That's a yes.
I'd kill to work undercover.

344
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:26,789
God, me, too.

345
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:27,616
You must have the best stories.

346
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,313
Nah.

347
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:31,054
Oh, come on. Give us one.

348
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:32,099
I've only been
a year on the job.

349
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:33,622
I've never seen any real action.

350
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:36,973
Alright, well, this one time,
a couple years back,

351
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:38,714
I get in with this biker gang,

352
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,021
and we're movin'
a hell-ton'a smack.

353
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:42,936
Now, the buyer, he smells a rat,

354
00:12:42,979 --> 00:12:44,981
and suddenly, I've got
six sawed-off shotties

355
00:12:45,025 --> 00:12:46,591
right to my grill. Mm.

356
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,376
They wanted me to try the batch,
make sure it wasn't bunk.

357
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:49,638
What'd you do?

358
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:50,813
Man, I got high
as the Hindenburg

359
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,119
and came down just as messy.

360
00:12:52,162 --> 00:12:53,598
Sorry. Wrong answer.

361
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:58,342
Ah.

362
00:12:58,386 --> 00:12:59,648
Real undercover cops
don't behave

363
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:01,432
like characters in movies.

364
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:03,260
Taste the drugs,

365
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:06,307
your case, your career are shot.

366
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,483
Suspect in custody.

367
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:11,181
- Thanks for the assist.
- Ah, no problem.

368
00:13:11,225 --> 00:13:12,704
I was giving a talk at
the local elementary school.

369
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,402
Yeah, I gotta admit,

370
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,926
I've actually never seen
a cop on a horse before.

371
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,754
Well, not out on the street,
anyway.

372
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,712
It's... weird.

373
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,410
You must have been looking
in the wrong direction.

374
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,804
Yeah, well, I am not now.

375
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:29,634
Officer Jackson West,
badge number 3-3-3-5-6.

376
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,462
- What's up, Silas?
- I don't know him.

377
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,029
Uh, this is Officer Young.

378
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:36,119
Isaac. Badge number 2-9-1-9-6.

379
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:37,991
And this here's Ruby,
official police horse

380
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,601
of the West Adams
Mounted Patrol.

381
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:40,732
Does she have a badge number?

382
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:42,517
No, but she lives in
stall number 11.

383
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,910
Uh, how's patrol?

384
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:44,867
Is there anything else
we can do?

385
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,914
Actually...

386
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:50,307
a sprinkler head
at Edgewood Park broke off

387
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,743
and is spraying the swings.

388
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,006
Okay. Well, I am on it.

389
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,572
It's, uh --
it's nice to meet you.

390
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:55,573
Yeah, you, too.

391
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,404
You two are looking
at each other funny.

392
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:04,060
I am his wife!
Open the damn door!

393
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:05,714
He doesn't want to see you!

394
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:07,542
Mack, I'm done. Can you hear me?

395
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:09,631
You're never gonna see
your sons again!

396
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:10,850
What's going on? Are you okay?

397
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,329
Mack's in there
with some stripper whore.

398
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:14,549
He's wasted out of his mind.

399
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:16,812
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

400
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,944
We're just hanging out.

401
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:18,858
Get Mack. I need to see him.

402
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:20,120
No, he's sleeping -- I think.

403
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:21,556
I don't know!
He won't talk to me.

404
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,862
Open the door.

405
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,341
- No, I can't.
- Open --

406
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:25,603

Did working the convention
as a patrol officer

434
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,576
feel like a demotion?

435
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,013
At first, yes.

436
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:30,842
But then, I don't know.
I got a contact anxiety high.

437
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:33,584
I do not miss the constant fear
and the lying so much

438
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:34,977
you don't know

00:15:42,854 --> 00:15:44,204
Hey. How you doing?

443
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:45,727
Victor's in my Ethics class.

444
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,120
You're a cop.

445
00:15:47,163 --> 00:15:48,512
I can see why
you might think that.

446
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:50,558
Um, but to be fair,
this uniform could also mean

447
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:51,820
I'm a male stripper.

448
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:53,126
Whoa. What's all that for?

449
00:15:53,169 --> 00:15:55,432

we got a narc inside.

Victor. Hey.

451
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:59,393
It's a little harsh. Victor.

Well... can't wait to hear
how class goes.

453
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:11,579
Hey.

454
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:13,015
Were you trying to
kill yourself?

455
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,061
God, Bradford, no.

456
00:16:15,104 --> 00:16:16,627
Okay, then what the hell
were you thinking?

457
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:18,847
You told me you were taking Oxy
because you were injured.

458
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,501
I was. Alright?

459
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,372
I am.

460
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,460
It was a mistake.

461
00:16:23,504 --> 00:16:24,635
A mistake? Yeah.

462
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,942
You downed opioids with whiskey.

463
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,204
Alright, that's not
pain management.

464
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:30,902
That is a problem. I know.

465
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:32,774
I screwed up, okay? Yeah.

466
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,036
I was just trying
to push through the pain

467
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,038
a-a-and keep working.

468
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:37,909
It got away from me.
Y-You know how it is.

469
00:16:37,953 --> 00:16:39,999
I do.

470
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,391
And I know addicts lie so much

471
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:42,566
they don't know
what's true anymore.

472
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,612
- Hey, I am not your ex-wife.
- Really?

473
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,397
'Cause from where I'm standing,
you look exactly like Isabel.

474
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,225
Look, I'm not gonna make
the same mistake I did with her.

475
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:51,314
You are going into a program.

476
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:53,621
Tomorrow.

477
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:56,580
You can't keep doing this
to your family, Mack.

478
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:58,669
I know. I know.

479
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:00,193
I will.

480
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:02,195
I promise.

481
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:12,074
Hello.

482
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,945
Hi. Mm-hmm.

483
00:17:13,989 --> 00:17:16,252
So, you know we're gonna have
to talk about it, right?

484
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:20,300
Look, it was a momentary
lapse in judgement,

485
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:22,302
and Tim has already scolded me
for listening in,

486
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,043
but I gotta say, um,

487
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:28,090
what I heard at your seminar
was amazing.

488
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,614
I was a little rusty,
but thank you.

489
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,007
Listen, I've been thinking a lot

490
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,835
about what I want to do

491
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:36,185
once I'm eligible to test,
and...

492
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:39,188
I think I could be really good
at undercover work.

493
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:40,885
I would love to
pick your brain sometime --

494
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,540
not about tactics, just...

495
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:46,456
what I should focus on
to prepare for the job.

496
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,850
I actually -- I... have time

497
00:17:48,893 --> 00:17:50,678
for drinks right now,
if you want.

498
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:52,593
Yeah. Great.

499
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:53,811
Alright. Uh... no.

500
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:56,597
I have a homework thing
with Tamara.

501
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,990
She won't mind if we do it
a little bit later.

502
00:17:59,034 --> 00:17:59,861
Let me just give her a call.

503
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:04,083
Hey, it's me.

504
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:06,520
Are we cool
if we do the interview

505
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:07,738
a little bit later tonight?

506
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,000
Is 9:00 too late for you?

507
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,698
Okay. Great.
I will see you then.

508
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:13,179
I am all yours.

509
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:17,574
Hey. You know you owe me
big time, right?

510
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:19,141
<i>Yeah, but can we keep
my tab open?</i>

511
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,360
<i>I could use another assist.</i>

512
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:22,492
Uh, I was about
to go out for drinks

513
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,146
with a colleague of mine,
Lucy Chen.

514
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,321
Hey.

515
00:18:25,365 --> 00:18:26,235
<i>I'm in a bind.</i>

516
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,410
<i>Look, the real reason</i>

517
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,672
<i>I couldn't make
the convention today</i>

518
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:29,847
<i>is because I spotted a tail</i>

519
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:30,892
<i>on my way down from Sacramento.</i>

520
00:18:30,935 --> 00:18:32,850
Who? <i>I think it's the buyer</i>

521
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,156
<i>in this op I've been running.</i>

522
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,244
<i>They're sniffing around
a big batch</i>

523
00:18:35,288 --> 00:18:36,593
<i>of liquid Fentanyl I'm selling.</i>

524
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:37,812
And you think they're onto you?

525
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,988
<i>I think there's
a lot of money in play</i>

526
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:41,076
<i>and they're paranoid as hell.</i>

527
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,860
Are they still surveilling you?

528
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,166
<i>Yeah, I couldn't lose them.</i>

529
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,647
<i>I think they put a tracker
on my car.</i>

530
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,214
<i>Look, I'm at The Smoke House
in Burbank,</i>

531
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:49,519
<i>but my whole team's
up in San Jose.</i>

532
00:18:49,563 --> 00:18:51,217
What are you driving?

533
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,697
<i>Black Mustang GT.
They know me as Coco.</i>

534
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:54,829
Alright, I'm on my way.

535
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:56,091
Sorry.

536
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,266
I'm gonna have to call Grey now,

537
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,615
and we're gonna have
to take a rain check

538
00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,139
on our drinks, but --Totally.

539
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:02,837
Unless you wanna come with?

540
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,191
Narc.

541
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:11,019
Hey. There's no call for that.

542
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:12,542
At least let me explain first?

543
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,153
- Explain what?
- That he's a cop.

544
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:15,023
Yeah, I know.

545
00:19:15,066 --> 00:19:16,024
What do you mean, you know?

546
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,635
Well, I saw it
on his application

547
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:20,028
when he signed up for my class.

548
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,334
And you didn't tell us?

549
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:23,553
Oh, it wasn't
my decision to make.

550
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:24,902
How can you say that?

551
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,165
Cops have been spying
on people like us

552
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,601
for 200 years.

553
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:29,907
He could be taking this class
to get close to us,

554
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,648
to get into LULAC
or Black Lives Matter.

555
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,172
Oh, I'm not undercover.

556
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,390
I'm -- I'm actually
just a rookie.

557
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:35,565
Dude, stop lying.

558
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:38,568
I'm not. Um...

559
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:41,615
Two years ago, I was working
construction back east.

560
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:43,530
I moved out here
to join the police

561
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:45,009
and make a difference.

562
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:47,969
I'm actually taking this class
to finally get my degree.

563
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:51,320
It's true.
I read his transcript.

564
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:53,453
Plus, do you really think
the LAPD's gonna send

565
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:56,064
a 40-something-year-old
white guy to infiltrate BLM?

566
00:19:56,107 --> 00:19:57,848
- Come on, now.
- Probably not.

567
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,720
He still should have
told us he's a cop.

568
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,287
Hmm.

569
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,854
Who here thinks that John
is ethically obligated

570
00:20:03,898 --> 00:20:05,769
to identify himself?

571
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,031
I do.

572
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,642
Why?

573
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:10,948
This is supposed to be
a safe space.

574
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:12,123
What if one of us
admitted to a crime

575
00:20:12,167 --> 00:20:13,603
in the middle of a discussion?

576
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,257
Well, then, you'd be stupid.

577
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:17,216
There are no
truly safe spaces --

578
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,348
I mean, certainly not
in a college classroom.

579
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:20,436
But believe it or not,

580
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,830
I, uh, was wrestling with

581
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:25,441
whether or not to tell you
last night, and...

582
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:28,139
honestly, I still don't know
what the right decision is.

583
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:30,925
Okay, well,
let's explore that further.

584
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:34,189
I want everyone in here
to write a five-page essay.

585
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,583
Tell me why or why not
you think that John had

586
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:38,367
an ethical obligation
to tell us he's a cop.

587
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:49,509
There's June's car.

588
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:07,962
Tracker.

589
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:09,529
What's the plan?

590
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:11,574
You go in, find June.

591
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,489
Remember, her undercover name
is Coco.

592
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,099
She's a friend in town.

593
00:21:15,143 --> 00:21:16,840
Buy her a drink, chat her up.

594
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:19,321
I will hang back and try
and spot who her tails are.

595
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,889
Okay. You up for this?

596
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:23,673
Hell yeah.

597
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,198
Coco?

598
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:30,854
Hey. Hey.

599
00:21:30,898 --> 00:21:33,074
Harper found a tracker outside.
We think they're here.

600
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,380
Yeah, I know.
One's at your 4:00.

601
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:36,077
Haven't spotted his backup yet.

602
00:21:40,124 --> 00:21:41,735
Hey, honey.
Can I get you something?

603
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:43,954
Yeah, sure. Uh, I will have
what she's having.

604
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:45,521
- Do you want another one?
- Sure.

605
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:49,133
Make it three.

606
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:50,744
Coco.

607
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:53,312
Hey, what a coincidence, seeing
you all the way down here.

608
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:55,357
Like hell. You followed me.

609
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,228
We got a lot of money
on the line with this deal,

610
00:21:57,272 --> 00:22:00,101
so we need to be very careful.

611
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:02,930
A lot of people in
this business, you know...

612
00:22:02,973 --> 00:22:04,758
they don't have integrity.

613
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:06,455
Yeah, 'cause you're
just filled with integrity,

614
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:09,110
aren't you, Sato?

615
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:12,592
Oh, you say my name in front of
someone that <i>I</i> don't know?

616
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:14,115
What is wrong with you?

617
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:15,682
No, what's wrong with <i>you?</i>

618
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:17,466
No one asked you to sit.

619
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:20,991
Who is this bitch?

620
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,604
Oh, you just killed yourself.

621
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:28,434
I'm looking at an empty chair
right there.

622
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:31,437
Then who's gonna conduct
the hydrogenation process?

623
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,134
Who's gonna perform
the molecular synthesis

624
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:34,440
to get the acid tables balanced?

625
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:35,658
You get that wrong,
you're gonna have

626
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:36,529
buyers with brain bleed.

627
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:38,879
You're the chemist.

628
00:22:38,922 --> 00:22:40,881
She's the chemist.

629
00:22:40,924 --> 00:22:42,099
Yeah, she is.

630
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:44,058
Now back off.

631
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:46,147
And tell your boss
the price just went up 5%

632
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,191
for the lack of trust.

633
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:49,411
Oh, I don't think so.

634
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,239
Let's take a walk,

635
00:22:51,282 --> 00:22:53,763
talk about this somewhere
a little more private.

636
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:55,852
Hmm?

637
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,598
We're gonna go
for a little ride.

638
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:04,426
Think about why, uh, I got
such a bad feeling about you.

639
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:07,864
These guys are cops.

640
00:23:07,908 --> 00:23:09,431
They put a tracker on your car.

641
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,477
Got a bad feeling about <i>me,</i> huh?

642
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,522
Hey, we're not cops.

643
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,655
You want me to do 'em here
or take 'em to the farm?

644
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:17,613
Hey, you gotta believe me.

645
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,441
Coco, you know me.

646
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:20,442
Then what's with the tracker?

647
00:23:20,486 --> 00:23:22,749
Salonga wanted you surveilled,

648
00:23:22,792 --> 00:23:24,228
in case you guys tried
to rip us off.

649
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:25,882
I swear.

650
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:28,624
Look, we want this deal
to happen.

651
00:23:28,668 --> 00:23:30,060
We <i>need</i> this deal
to happen, okay?

652
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:31,584
We just wanted to make sure.

653
00:23:31,627 --> 00:23:32,933
Well, now you are.

654
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:35,370
But the price just went up 10%.

655
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,503
Consider it a tax
for pissing me off.

656
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:38,982
Salonga ain't gonna go for that.

657
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:40,680
Hmm, then this is goodbye.
I got plenty of other buyers.

658
00:23:40,723 --> 00:23:41,594
Yeah, okay, okay!

659
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,989
I'll make it happen.

660
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,556
But she comes, too.

661
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,340
At that price, I want her
to test the product

662
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:51,995
in front of us to make sure
that it's pure.

663
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,823
Forget it. No.
She doesn't go out on buys.

664
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,173
What? N-No. I'll go.

665
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,785
I've already spent my share
of the money in my head.

666
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:01,309
I'll call you on this phone
with the new location.

667
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:03,180
And you better pick up
on the first ring.

668
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:04,094
Now piss off.

669
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,968
Come on.

670
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,109
I can't believe
we just did that.

671
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:20,720
"You want me to do them here
or take 'em to the farm?"

672
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:22,809
You are <i>so</i> badass!

673
00:24:22,852 --> 00:24:25,028
Wait, how much do you know
about opioid chemistry?

674
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:26,726
I mean, just what they
taught me at the Academy.

675
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:29,206
But I got straight A's
in high school chemistry, so...

676
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,470
Then you're gonna have
some homework to do.

677
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:35,256
What time is it?

678
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,914
Hey. Look, I am <i>so</i> sorry.

679
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:43,307
- It's cool.
- No, it's not.

680
00:24:43,351 --> 00:24:45,396
Drinks turned into
this undercover thing,

681
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,922
which was super cool --
but not the point.

682
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:52,534
Look, there's no excuse
for me leaving you hanging.

683
00:24:52,578 --> 00:24:54,493
Can you do the interview now?
Or tonight?

684
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,319
When is your paper due?

685
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:56,451
It's fine.

686
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:57,757
The drunk lady across the hall

687
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,020
used to be a luchadora.

688
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:00,890
I'll just ask her.

689
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:01,978
What?

690
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:03,806
Mexican wrestler. No. No.

691
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,417
Look, give me another chance.

692
00:25:06,461 --> 00:25:07,680
Okay? Tonight.

693
00:25:07,723 --> 00:25:09,551
I promise I'll be there.

694
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:11,945
Okay. Sure.

695
00:25:11,988 --> 00:25:13,294
Now I gotta get to school.

696
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:14,556
Okay.

697
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:20,519
You get my report
on Mack Daniels?

698
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:24,305
Yeah, I did.

699
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:27,003
Are you sure this is the way
you want things to go?

700
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:28,962
He'll get fired,
might do jail time.

701
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,616
Mack didn't get hurt
a month ago.

702
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,008
He got hurt six months ago.

703
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:33,575
He's deep into an addiction,

704
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:35,751
and he's walking around
with a loaded gun.

705
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,013
And, sir, i-it's not just that.

706
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:39,015
I-I went back to his hotel room.

707
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,103
There were prescription bottles

708
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:41,583
with other people's names
on 'em.

709
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,324
And he could be doing anything
to get those pills.

710
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,239
Cops have to be held to
a higher standard.

711
00:25:45,282 --> 00:25:46,849
Anything less,
all hell breaks loose.

712
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:49,243
I agree.

713
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:52,246
I just wanted to make sure
you saw the repercussions.

714
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:53,900
He's going to lose his pension.

715
00:25:53,943 --> 00:25:56,467
Yeah. I-I struggled with that.

716
00:25:59,166 --> 00:26:01,342
But it's what I should have
done with Isabel.

717
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:03,562
Alright.

718
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:04,824
So, one more thing.

719
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:06,826
Chen's going on
a special assignment today.

720
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:09,872
She'll be joining Harper
on an undercover operation.

721
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,962
This is Sergeant June Zhang
of Fresno PD.

722
00:26:13,006 --> 00:26:14,964
We are gonna help out
on her op today.

723
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,792
Appreciate the assistance, guys.

724
00:26:16,836 --> 00:26:18,489
I'm June, the UC.

725
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,143
My case officer,
Lieutenant Balasco,

726
00:26:20,187 --> 00:26:22,972
who is not nearly as mean
and awful as he looks.

727
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:24,452
For the last eight months,

728
00:26:24,495 --> 00:26:26,976
I have been up on a crew
out of San Jose who made bank

729
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,326
selling precursors of
liquid Fentanyl.

730
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,677
But they got greedy, tried to go
from selling the parts

731
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,070
to making and selling
the finished product.

732
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:36,072
But their lab blew up,
killing their chemist

733
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:37,639
and destroying
their entire supply,

734
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:40,686
leaving them with no product
and a lot of pissed-off buyers.

735
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:43,340
Which is when I swooped in,
promising enough product

736
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,473
to satisfy all their customers
and then some.

737
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:48,302
But last night, all our
hard work almost fell apart,

738
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:52,175
until the quick thinking
of Officer Chen saved my ass.

739
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,829
Chen, stand up so they can
see what you're wearing.

740
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:56,527
- Yeah.
- The op today is simple.

741
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:59,139
Trade drugs for cash,
then arrest everybody

742
00:26:59,182 --> 00:27:02,098
and try to get them to flip on
Aldo Salonga, their boss.

743
00:27:02,142 --> 00:27:03,796
Alright.
You have your assignment.

744
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,102
Everyone in position
by 10:00 a.m.

745
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:09,671
What the hell are you doing?

746
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,455
You can't pit an
untrained probationary officer

747
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:12,500
against one of
the most dangerous

748
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:13,936
crime syndicates in California.

749
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,721
I don't want to hear it, Tim.
She volunteered.

750
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:17,331
Plus, Grey authorized it,

751
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:20,160
and we have some of
the best operational expertise

752
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:21,465
she could ask for.

753
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,946
They know the gladiator cage
you're walking into.

754
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,948
You don't.
That's not volunteering.

755
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:27,080
That's being used.

756
00:27:29,386 --> 00:27:32,476
Hey, don't let Bradford
kill your confidence, okay?

757
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,219
His... hang-ups about UC work
are his to deal with, not yours.

758
00:27:36,263 --> 00:27:38,657
I kinda hoped that
he would be proud of me.

759
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,398
Wow. That sounds stupid
when I say it out loud.

760
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,966
No, it doesn't.
He's your training officer.

761
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,272
He's gotten you this far.

762
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:47,274
There's nothing wrong
with wanting his approval.

763
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:49,580
And for what it's worth,
you've got mine.

764
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:52,105
You handled yourself
like a pro last night.

765
00:27:52,148 --> 00:27:53,367
Those instincts can't be taught.

766
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,108
Thanks.

767
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:56,849
Hey! I need your help!

768
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,502
Somebody hurt Silas! Come on!

769
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:04,639
I came by this morning,
found him like this.

770
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,989
He won't say what happened.

771
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:09,731
Silas.
Look, Officer West is here.

772
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:13,387
Hey, Silas. Looks like it hurts.

773
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,782
Did you, uh, crash your bike?

774
00:28:16,825 --> 00:28:19,698
Someone hurt you?

775
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:21,395
- Where is your bike?
- It's okay.

776
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:23,005
You can talk to us.

777
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:25,573
If anything happened,
let us help.

778
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:27,009
I called his mother.

779
00:28:27,053 --> 00:28:28,576
She's -- She's on her way
back from work now.

780
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:30,752
Okay, well,
in the meantime, Silas,

781
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:32,232
come back to the Center,

782
00:28:32,275 --> 00:28:33,799
and we'll get those wounds
cleaned up, alright?

783
00:28:34,974 --> 00:28:36,758
I'm never going back there.

784
00:28:36,802 --> 00:28:39,979
What? Why?

785
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:43,417
Look, uh,
I'm sorry to hear that.

786
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,027
Do you mind if I borrow
your notebook?

787
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:48,857
Finish up your patrol for you?

788
00:28:48,901 --> 00:28:50,206
Look, I'll, uh, bring it back.

789
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,555
Promise.

790
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:57,083
Hey, can you, uh --
can you stay with him?

791
00:28:57,126 --> 00:28:58,911
Yeah.

792
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:02,653
Hey. Yeah, it's, uh,
Jackson West.

793
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:03,785
Are you still working
in the area?

794
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:20,236
Control, 7-Adam-07,
show us Code 6.

795
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:24,153
Silas' last entry was a broken
street light at this address.

796
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:25,851
- Something happened.
- Check it out.

797
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:36,905
The bike.

798
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,086
Police!

799
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,221
- What?
- Sir, we need to
talk to you

800
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:49,352
about this bike over here
and what happened

801
00:29:49,396 --> 00:29:50,789
to the young man
who was riding it.

802
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:52,225
<i>...Madness,"</i>

803
00:29:52,268 --> 00:29:53,182
<i>the show where
everyone's a winner.</i>

804
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:54,140
Sir, open the door right now.

805
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:56,490
He's running!

806
00:29:58,144 --> 00:29:59,536
<i>...and win the gold.</i>

807
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,234
<i>Now here he is.</i>

808
00:30:01,277 --> 00:30:03,497
Nothing. with the gift of gab,</i>

809
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,281
<i>your "Money Madness" host,
Sam Lovejoy.</i>

810
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:07,457
Show yourself now!

811
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:08,632
<i>Thank you, Bobby,
and hello, everybody.</i>

812
00:30:08,676 --> 00:30:10,199
<i>This is "Money Madness."</i>

813
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:12,332
<i>I'm Sam Lovejoy,
and I just can't wait</i>

814
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:14,116
<i>to give away all this cash.

815
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,378
<i>Just look at my suit pocket.</i>

816
00:30:15,422 --> 00:30:17,293
<i>It's bursting at the seams
with cash.</i>

817
00:30:17,337 --> 00:30:19,992
<i>Now, Bobby, who's tonight's
first soon-to-be winner?</i>

818
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:22,168
<i>Sam, this is Miss Donna McGee</i>

819
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:24,300
-<i>from Akron, Ohio. Hello.</i>

820
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:26,041
<i>Now, Bobby, who do we
have playing on the phone?</i>

821
00:30:26,085 --> 00:30:27,216
<i>Just darling Donna.</i>

822
00:30:28,522 --> 00:30:29,479
Get out of my house!

823
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,744
This is my house!
Get out of it, I said!

824
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:35,268
Hey, hey! Come on. Come on.

825
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:36,878
Come on!

826
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:38,837
Ow!

827
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,100
He was spying on me!

828
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:43,885
I saw him, outside,
writing things about me,

829
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,234
saying I'm crazy. I'm not crazy!

830
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:46,409
He's just a kid.

831
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:47,323
He was staring at
a broken street light.

832
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:48,411
You didn't have to hurt him.

833
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:49,848
Liar. Liar!

834
00:30:49,891 --> 00:30:51,458
I taught him. I taught him.

835
00:30:51,501 --> 00:30:52,241
I taught him!

836
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:05,124
I know you're worried
about Lucy.

837
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:06,690
Who said I was worried?

838
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:09,128
I'm just saying,
she can handle herself.

839
00:31:09,171 --> 00:31:11,913
I <i>know</i> she can. I trained her.

840
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:14,089
Eagle One in place.

841
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:17,353
Alright, uh, let's go over this
one more time.

842
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:19,442
Salonga's crew arrives,

843
00:31:19,486 --> 00:31:21,923
you test the Fentanyl,
give them a show,

844
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,272
we get the money,
they get this van,

845
00:31:23,316 --> 00:31:25,622
and then, boom,
strike team takes them down.

846
00:31:25,666 --> 00:31:26,928
Walk in the park.

847
00:31:26,972 --> 00:31:28,799
And if not...

848
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,412
...we make some noise until
the cavalry arrives.

849
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,068
You want to go over
the signals again?

850
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:38,374
Yeah. "Workhorse" means
we're in trouble.

851
00:31:38,418 --> 00:31:40,376
And "Beautiful day,"
we're all good.

852
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,292
Lucy. Mm-hmm?

853
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:45,555
- Are <i>you</i> all good?
- Yeah. Yes.

854
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:48,080
You know, if you're not nervous,
you're not human.

855
00:31:48,123 --> 00:31:51,866
Okay? So, use this
to your advantage.

856
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,043
Be scared. Be wild.
Be unpredictable.

857
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:56,653
Be a cobra.

858
00:32:02,311 --> 00:32:03,922
Can I ask you a question?

859
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:05,445
No. What's your formula

860
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:07,142
for when you tell people
you're a police officer

861
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:08,404
in off-duty life?

862
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,711
I try not to put myself
in social situations

863
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:12,365
where I need to. Right.

864
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:14,933
It's just that I got outed as
a cop in my Criminal Law class,

865
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:16,108
and there's some
pretty strong feelings

866
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:18,719
that I should've been
upfront about it.

867
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:20,373
You did the right thing
keeping it a secret.

868
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:21,635
Now you gotta
sit in the back row,

869
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:23,028
always have your eyes
on the door.

870
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:25,073
Why?

871
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:26,553
Because they know
you're a cop now,

872
00:32:26,596 --> 00:32:27,989
which means they know you carry
an off-duty weapon.

873
00:32:28,033 --> 00:32:29,512
Somebody may try
to take it from you,

874
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:31,210
or maybe just attack you
because they hate cops.

875
00:32:31,253 --> 00:32:34,256
All due respect, I can't live
my life like that --

876
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,779
with being suspicious of people,

877
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:37,738
seeing the world as dangerous.

878
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:40,088
The world <i>is</i> dangerous.

879
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:41,698
Being vigilant is
the price of admission.

880
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:47,487
It's go time.

881
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:55,364
- Let's do this!
- Where's the money?

882
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:56,844
First things first.

883
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:58,411
I wanna test the shipment.

884
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:39,626
Hard positives on every scale.

885
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:40,801
When's the last time
you saw that?

886
00:33:40,844 --> 00:33:42,281
Never.

887
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:43,717
There's nothing available
this pure.

888
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,849
Now let's see the cash.

889
00:33:46,894 --> 00:33:48,765
We're in business.

890
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:52,639
Who the hell is that?

891
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:54,162
We've got another guest
at the party.

892
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:55,468
Standby for rescue.

893
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:57,035
If this is a set-up,
you're the first to go.

894
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,559
Relax.

895
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:00,864
It's just my boss.

896
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:05,913
And he wants to talk... to you.

897
00:34:05,956 --> 00:34:07,784
Me?

898
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:10,874
Good morning.

899
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:14,182
My apologies for last night.

900
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:16,663
Sato overstepped.

901
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:17,794
It won't happen again.

902
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:21,755
Come in and talk to me.

903
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:24,105
Why?

904
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:27,152
A monkey can be taught
to test for drugs...

905
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:30,155
or a cop.

906
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:33,462
I need to see that
you really know the science.

907
00:34:33,506 --> 00:34:35,638
Why aren't we going in there
and arresting everybody?

908
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:36,900
We need to see the money first.

909
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:44,430
What the hell.
It's a beautiful day.

910
00:34:44,473 --> 00:34:46,127
Nothing's gonna go wrong.

911
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:54,918
Don't concern yourself with him.

912
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:57,051
It's a little hard not to.

913
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:00,141
Okay, stop trying to scare me

914
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,447
and just tell me
what we're doing here.

915
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:04,319
Simple.

916
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:07,627
I know a little chemistry.

917
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:11,848
The hydromorphone hydrochloride
you're selling --

918
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:13,111
remind me of the formula.

919
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:37,222
You speak Tagalog.

920
00:35:37,265 --> 00:35:40,094
My best friend in elementary
school grew up in Quezon City.

921
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,271
I... basically
lived at her house.

922
00:35:43,315 --> 00:35:45,143
I picked up a little bit.

923
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:49,234
Problem?

924
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:51,932
Nope.

925
00:35:51,975 --> 00:35:55,065
I just have a flair
for the dramatic.

926
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:57,807
Okay. Are we done?

927
00:35:57,851 --> 00:36:00,549
I like you.

928
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:02,334
So I have an offer.

929
00:36:02,377 --> 00:36:04,858
I kill Coco and the other one.

930
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:07,774
You keep half the money.

931
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:08,818
Come work for me.

932
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:16,130
Betrayal's not really my style,

933
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,045
but I'm flattered by the offer.

934
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:19,742
Can we finish the deal now?

935
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:53,254
Now, that's sexy.

936
00:36:59,695 --> 00:37:01,001
Weapons down!

937
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:02,263
Weapons down on the ground
right now!

938
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:03,786
Drop the gun!
Hands above your head!

939
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,353
Interlace your fingers!

940
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:06,789
Put your hands behind your head!
Interlace your fingers now!

941
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,356
Hands behind your head.

942
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,792
Hands up, weapons down.

943
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:11,838
Do <i>not</i> move. You okay?

944
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:13,883
- Give me your hands.
- Sato!

945
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:15,450
You set us up, you snitch!

946
00:37:15,494 --> 00:37:17,017
You're dead! You hear me?!

947
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,453
- Eyes on him.
- You're dead!

948
00:37:18,497 --> 00:37:21,891
- You watch your back!
- This brings back
some memories.

949
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:25,417
- First day together.
- Oh, right.

950
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,766
Watch your head.

951
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,385
You did good.

952
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:52,835
Beth. Hey.

953
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:54,097
You okay?

954
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:57,884
Tim Bradford,
my hero and savior.

955
00:37:57,927 --> 00:37:59,015
I didn't have a choice.

956
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:00,495
The hell you didn't.

957
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:02,105
When your coked out ex-wife
was working undercover,

958
00:38:02,149 --> 00:38:03,672
you had all kinds of options.

959
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:07,285
Now, all of a sudden,
your hands are tied?

960
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:10,026
Hypocritical bastard.

961
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,507
I-I can't excuse the past, okay?

962
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:13,769
But this is now,

963
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:15,380
and Mack crossed too many lines.

964
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:18,296
I have three young kids
and a husband

965
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:20,472
who is looking
at <i>years</i> in state prison

966
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:22,300
and no more pension.

967
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:25,607
How am I supposed to
feed my kids?

968
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:28,436
I'm sorry this happened.

969
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,569
But I didn't do it to you.

970
00:38:30,612 --> 00:38:31,613
Mack did.

971
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:35,051
You... are a cop.

972
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:37,184

I needed some help.

997
00:39:36,112 --> 00:39:37,984
I'm not gonna write
your paper for you.

998
00:39:38,027 --> 00:39:41,683
No. No. I-I was hoping maybe you
could tell me <i>what</i> to write.

999
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:43,424
I've spent the last two days
talking to cops about

1000
00:39:43,468 --> 00:39:45,034
whether I should've
identified myself,

1001
00:39:45,078 --> 00:39:48,342
and the answers have ranged from
"probably not" to "no way."

1002
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,389
But ...am struggling

1003
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:54,087
with how betrayed
my classmates felt.

1004
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,396
So, I just... need a little
outside perspective.

1005
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:01,355
You should've said something.

1006
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,662
I'm sure there are
a dozen reasons why cops think

1007
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:05,359
that your job is
a need-to-know thing,

1008
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,447
but come on.

1009
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:08,101
It's 2021.

1010

You guys have a hell of a lot
to make up for.

1011
00:40:10,712 --> 00:40:13,149
So, you want to win back trust?

1012
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:15,238
You gotta assume a higher level
of responsibility.

1013
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:18,503
You gotta go the extra mile
every single time.

1014
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:20,853
You think I have a chance
to mend some fences here?

1015
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:23,986
Yeah. I do.

1016
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:26,467
Everyone in this classroom
wants to change the system,

1017
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:30,558
and they're driven by hope
and a ton of anger.

1018
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:33,605
But hope is what keeps them
moving forward.

1019
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:34,954
So if they see that
you're serious

1020
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:36,695
about being part of the change,

1021
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:39,437

1038
00:41:13,253 --> 00:41:15,429
Mm-hmm, so that they can
drool over you

1039
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,127
in a cloud of their own farts.

1040
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:20,303
I don't think I can use
any of this for my paper.

1041
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:21,522

1042
00:41:21,566 --> 00:41:23,306

1045

but does it still feel like
you have to act like a man

1046
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,838
- to fit in?
- Good question.

1047
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:35,188
Well, you're the rookie,

00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:43,544
I think fitting in is a trap.

1052
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:47,461
I'm sitting between two of
the best cops in the state...

1053
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,855
Mm....who had to navigate

1054
00:41:49,898 --> 00:41:53,772
an avalanche of obstacles
just to get to the mountaintop.

1055
00:41:53,815 --> 00:41:55,338
They didn't do it
by trying to fit in.

1056
00:41:55,382 --> 00:41:58,124
They did it by --
you know, by, um...

1057
00:41:58,167 --> 00:42:02,432
being stronger, smarter,
more agile.

1058
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:05,261
They had to to navigate
a system that still believes

1059
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:08,047
being a girl is inherently
soft or weak,

1060
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,224
as though empathy
is somehow a liability.

1061
00:42:11,267 --> 00:42:13,531
There isn't a guy in the force

1062
00:42:13,574 --> 00:42:16,142
who can do what these guys
can do.
Mm.

1063
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:18,274
And there sure as hell
isn't anyone tougher.

1064
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:19,754
Hoo! I will drink to that.

1065
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:20,755
Hell yeah.

1066
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:29,590

1067
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,707
Damn it!
