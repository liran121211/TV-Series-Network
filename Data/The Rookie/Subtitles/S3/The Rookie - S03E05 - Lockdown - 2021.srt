1
00:00:00,283 --> 00:00:01,544
Previously on "The Rookie"...

2
00:00:01,588 --> 00:00:03,718
You both will receive
letters of reprimand.

3
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:05,414
Officer Nolan,
you have to pass

4
00:00:05,457 --> 00:00:08,153
a review board test to advance.
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:10,717
Any hopes of making
detective should be abandoned.

6
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,413
What's going on?
Turns out I'm predisposed

7
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:13,934
to fragile X syndrome.

8
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:16,629
If my DNA --
Stop.

9
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:18,586
I'll make an appointment
to see your mom's doctor.

10
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:20,455
Get your hands off my wife!
Everybody on the ground!

11
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:22,325
We need a supervisor out here.
Code 3.

12
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:24,412
You questioned every move I
made. Don't let it happen again.

13
00:00:24,455 --> 00:00:26,628
He's a disgrace to the badge.
He has to go.

14
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:28,846
So how do I get him?
Chronicle every offense.

15
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,715
When we get enough,
we go to I.A.

16
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:32,932
Doug Stanton. He was your T.O.
What about him?

17
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:34,932
Wondering if you liked
the way he does business.

18
00:00:34,976 --> 00:00:37,453
Preserve the evidence.
I'm gonna take our
friend back to the shop.

19
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:39,106
Doug's about to beat
the crap out of a suspect.

20
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,453
I told you
to guard the drugs.

21
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:41,801
The last rookie did
everything I told him to.

22
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:43,323
Guy's name was Owens.
You know him?

23
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:45,062
I had to write a blue page up
on the kid.

24
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:48,496
I can personally attest to
Officer West being a solid cop.

25
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,278
It'd be such a waste to have him
wash out of the program.

26
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,277
I still can't believe Doug's
rookie threw you under the bus.

27
00:00:57,321 --> 00:00:59,364
Can we please
not talk about it?

28
00:00:59,408 --> 00:01:02,016
Like, I just want to watch some
trashy TV and shut my brain off.

29
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,495
Mm-hmm.

30
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:05,973
Food porn...

31
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,233
...house porn or...

32
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:10,624
...true crime.

33
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:12,102
True crime, for sure.

34
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,928
Oh. That's weird.

35
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,754
It's Sergeant Grey.

36
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:25,927
Sir.
Can I come in?

37
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:27,884
Sure. Yeah.

38
00:01:27,927 --> 00:01:29,622
Officer Chen,
can you give us a minute?

39
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,579
Yes. Of course.

40
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:35,447
Hey, I'm just gonna fill her in
as soon as you leave, so...

41
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:37,883
That's your call.

42
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:40,273
So, uh, what's going on?

43
00:01:40,317 --> 00:01:41,664
So, Officer Stanton
came by my office

44
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:44,056
at the end of shift
tonight.

45
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,577
He issued you a blue page
for disobeying an order

46
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,577
and leaving evidence
unattended.

47
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,924
He set me up. Look,
I only left that evidence

48
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:53,924
because I thought he was
gonna hurt our suspect.
Sgt. Grey: Doesn't matter.

49
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:55,924
You're still his rookie,
and you disobeyed his order.

50
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,141
As long as he's your T.O.,
he has the power to keep

51
00:01:58,184 --> 00:01:59,706
issuing you blue pages

52
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:03,097
until you're bounced
out of the program.

53
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:04,662
So I'm pulling the plug,

54
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:06,618
assigning you
a new training officer.

55
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:08,966
No. Sir --
It's not
your decision, son.

56
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,488
I'm not gonna see your career
ended before it begins.

57
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,270
Not for the likes
of Doug Stanton.

58
00:02:13,314 --> 00:02:14,748
I don't want a career

59
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:16,879
if it means making way
for cops like Stanton.

60
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:19,356
Just give me
one more chance.

61
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,182
I know this guy.
He -- He's a bully.

62
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:24,095
Like, if I act shook and beg for
forgiveness, he'll believe it.

63
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,573
Please, sir. We cannot
give up on this now.

64
00:02:26,616 --> 00:02:28,746
Do you understand if
you're fired as a rookie,

65
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:30,007
you're radioactive?

66
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:32,702
No law-enforcement agency
will touch you.

67
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:36,093
You will neverbecome
a police officer.

68
00:02:36,137 --> 00:02:37,876
Are you really willing
to risk that?

69
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:42,745
Without hesitation.

70
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:02,091
Sorry for the wait.

71
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:03,743
Do you have
the test results?

72
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:05,395
Your husband's
not joining us?

73
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:07,134
Fiancé.

74
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:10,003
And no. He thinks I'm taking
the test next week.

75
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:12,916
I don't understand.

76
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,481
I love him,
but he sprung this on me,

77
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:19,046
and I don't know
what I'll do if it's real.

78
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:21,002
Well, it's not.

79
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:23,654
Your amnio came back
negative for fragile X,

80
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:27,393
as well as all other
major genetic disorders.

81
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:29,306
So my baby's okay?

82
00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:31,740
Yes.

83
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:33,740
Thank you.

84
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:38,348
Thank God.

85
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,217
Tim: He gave Jacksona blue page?

86
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,130
It's not your fault.
Of course it is.

87
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:46,130
I'm the one that reachedout to Doug's
old rookieto get dirt on him.

88
00:03:46,173 --> 00:03:47,738
What's a blue page?
Who's Doug?

89
00:03:47,781 --> 00:03:49,217
It's a failed evaluation.
None of your business.

90
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,825
Any way I could get
some breakfast?

91
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:52,694
We arrested you
for stealing bagels.

92
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:53,520
Yeah, but I didn't
get to eat any.

93
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,258
Can you take her to processing?

94
00:03:59,302 --> 00:04:01,302
Oh. Uh, de-escalate.

95
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:02,824
We do not want to makethings worse for Jackson.

96
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,476
Hey, Stanton, you ever
want to brush up on any

97
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,605
arrest-control techniques,
I'm available.

98
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:07,779
Any time.
Yeah? How about now?

99
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:10,605
Let's go.
We are on duty, so come on.

100
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,040
Aw. That's sweet.

101
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,648
Your hot little boot's
trying to rescue you.

102
00:04:14,691 --> 00:04:16,388
You're the onethat's gonna need rescuing.

103
00:04:16,431 --> 00:04:18,256
Are you threatening me?
Oh, I'm just saying.

104
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,604
I have a great
hair-pull takedown

105
00:04:19,648 --> 00:04:21,691
that I have been
dying to try.

106
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:23,952
All right. Come on, Boot.
We got a suspect to book.

107
00:04:23,995 --> 00:04:25,603
What a joke.

108
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:26,908
What happened
to "De-escalate,

109
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:27,995
we don't want to make things
harder for Jackson"?

110
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,342
I don't know.That was super weird.

111
00:04:29,386 --> 00:04:31,212
I feel like I hada testosterone contact high.

112
00:04:31,255 --> 00:04:32,951
All right. Look. Keep in close
contact with Jackson today.

113
00:04:32,994 --> 00:04:34,646
If they call for backup
of any kind, we're there.

114
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:35,299
Agreed.

115
00:04:45,037 --> 00:04:48,124
Hey. Hey!
Looking good.

116
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:50,166
Oh, I hate
dressing for court.

117
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,340
It reminds me of
custody hearings for Lila.

118
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:54,818
You are studying
down to the wire, I see.

119
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,992
My entire career depends

120
00:04:57,036 --> 00:04:58,774
on how I do on this
disciplinary exam.

121
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:01,296
So if my locker is cleaned out
by the time you get back,

122
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:02,904
it's been nice knowing you.

123
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:04,599
Okay. The only way
that you fail at this

124
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:06,338
is if you let fear take over.

125
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:09,599
Anxiety, it --
it lives in your muscles.

126
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,598
So the only way to get rid of it
is to shake it out.

127
00:05:12,642 --> 00:05:14,034
You mean literally shake?

128
00:05:14,077 --> 00:05:17,120
Mm-hmm. It's what I do.
Come on. Try it.

129
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,859
Oh, come on. That's lame.

130
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:23,902
You want to ace this exam,
you got to shake it out!

131
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,466
Oh. Oh. Okay. So, you know what,
Detective Harper?

132
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:40,596
See, sometimes this
angelic countenance

133
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,379
betrays how devilishyou truly are.

134
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:45,161
Oh, that was good. Okay.

135
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:46,944
I got to go, but listen.

136
00:05:46,986 --> 00:05:50,117
You are gonna kick ass at
this exam, I have no doubt.

137
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:57,985
Officer West.

138
00:05:58,029 --> 00:05:59,985
Figured you would've
pulled the rip cord,

139
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,637
asked for a new T.O.

140
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,985
No, sir. That's, uh...

141
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,811
That's not what I want.

142
00:06:05,855 --> 00:06:07,897
Really? 'Cause your friends
are sure looking for a fight.

143
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:10,289
Yeah. Well, I'm not.

144
00:06:10,332 --> 00:06:12,462
Sir,
I've wanted to be a copsince I was a toddler,

145
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:14,331
and I can't afford
to stumble now.

146
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:18,505
So from here on out,
I've gotyour six no matter what, sir.

147
00:06:22,027 --> 00:06:23,417
Sgt. Grey: Final question.

148
00:06:23,461 --> 00:06:25,635
Duty Manual Volume One,

149
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:30,113
Section 210, Point 46,
Paragraph 2 states?

150
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,939
An employee's obligationto report and prevent misconduct

151
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:35,547
begins the moment that employee
becomes a member

152
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,677
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

153
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:44,328
Congratulations,
Officer Nolan.

154
00:06:44,372 --> 00:06:46,806
You passed. 98%.

155
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,806
Really?
Which one did I miss?

156
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,111
That's -- You know what?
Never mind.

157
00:06:50,154 --> 00:06:51,111
That's -- Uh, sorry.
Thank you.

158
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:55,197
This is a relief
to have this behind me.

159
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,371
It's in your records
forever.

160
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:00,500
Yes, but certainly this mark
has to help my case.

161
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:03,631
In becoming a detective.

162
00:07:06,544 --> 00:07:08,760
Your letter of reprimand
has been CC'd

163
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,630
to every lieutenant and captain
in the department.

164
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:13,543
Trust me.
They have long memories.

165
00:07:13,586 --> 00:07:16,108
So for you to even
be considered for detective,

166
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:18,716
every one of them
would have to retire,

167
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,368
and most of those guys
are younger than you.

168
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:25,411
Well, I've beaten
the odds before.

169
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:28,194
Nolan, um...

170
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:30,193
you're a good cop with a --

171
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:34,106
a long...ish career
ahead of you.

172
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:38,888
But detective is no longer
in your path.

173
00:07:38,932 --> 00:07:41,105
You need to make peace
with that.

174
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:44,018
Yes, sir.

175
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:45,931
Oh, one more thing.

176
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:47,669
Since Harper's in court
this afternoon,

177
00:07:47,713 --> 00:07:49,974
you'll be working
the front desk.

178
00:07:50,018 --> 00:07:51,756
Yes, sir.

179
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,104
Hi. I'm here to check some
evidence out for court.

180
00:07:57,147 --> 00:07:58,451
And I need
to log some in.

181
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:00,017
Forms?

182
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,277
You're new, right?

183
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,451
Riley started a week ago.

184
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:05,885
We bonded
while I logged in

185
00:08:05,929 --> 00:08:07,929
about a million
stolen credit cards.

186
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:10,711
You remember that, Ri?

187
00:08:10,754 --> 00:08:12,537
You're so bad.
She'll get fired if command

188
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,276
catches her fraternizing
with cops.

189
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,579
Yeah, I know, but deep down,
I can tell she likes me.

190
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,058
Isn't that right, Ri?

191
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:21,188
You're right. It's palpable.

192
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:22,449
Sign here.

193
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:24,101
How long till these
lab results come back?

194
00:08:24,144 --> 00:08:26,578
Not my job.

195
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:29,578
My body is creating life faster
than our lab processes evidence.

196
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:31,361
Jackson: So, what's
the plan for today?

197
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:33,882
Premise check some seedy SROs?
Maybe hit up warrant units,

198
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:35,577
see if they need any
violent felons picked up?

199
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:37,926
First we need to talk.
Off the record.

200
00:08:42,012 --> 00:08:43,447
You mind?

201
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,229
It's, uh --
It's turned off.

202
00:08:45,273 --> 00:08:46,881
We both know that once
you turn it back on,

203
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:49,750
the recording automatically
goes back two minutes.

204
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:51,620
I want this to stay
between us.

205
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:01,271
Look, I had no choice with
the blue page. You boxed me in.

206
00:09:01,314 --> 00:09:04,923
Look, I know. I-I messed up.
I-I should've come to you.

207
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:06,705
I would've listened.
I'm sorry.

208
00:09:06,748 --> 00:09:08,270
You know,
I've seen it before.

209
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:10,139
You think I'm too hard-core
because you're a millennial

210
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,357
full of kid-glove ideals and
everyone deserves a trophy.

211
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,791
But the streets don't work
like that. All right?

212
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:19,182
And you're too good a cop
to end up a security guard.

213
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,051
That's why I am begging you
for a second shot.

214
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:25,616
Look, I will be
the best rookie/partner

215
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:27,790
that you've ever had.

216
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,094
Please.

217
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:37,702
To a fresh start.
Fresh start.

218
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:40,441
Thank you, sir.

219
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:41,657
All right.

220
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,919
Stella: Excuse me.
Uh, can you help me?

221
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:47,527
Someone stole my bike.

222
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,614
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let's get you started.

223
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:52,222
Fill out one of these and
bring it right back to me.
Thanks.

224
00:09:52,266 --> 00:09:54,135
You're being released
on an 849"b",

225
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,265
which means
we're not charging you.

226
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,091
Does this mean I get
the bagels back?

227
00:09:57,134 --> 00:09:58,656
No. The bagels
were disposed of.

228
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,568
Do you know how bad that is
for the environment?

229
00:10:00,612 --> 00:10:03,351
I'm a freegan. That goes
against my whole ethos.

230
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,960
Real freegans forage for food
in the Dumpster.

231
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:06,655
They don't steal
from bakeries.

232
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:08,568
Dumpsters are gross.

233
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:10,090
Look, could you at least call me
a cab? I don't believe in money.

234
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,916
No. Sorry.
It's against our ethos.

235
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:15,915
How was your exam?

236
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,045
Uh, passed.

237
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:19,523
Oh. Well....
don't sound so excited.

238
00:10:19,566 --> 00:10:21,697
Oh. No.
It's just, um...

239
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,653
Grey confirmed
I'd never make detective.

240
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:25,914
You mean you still
thought you had a shot?

241
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:27,739
In my heart,
I just -- I hoped.

242
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:29,914
Hey! Some chick's trying to
steal a car in your parking lot!

243
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,261
Yes.

244
00:10:35,304 --> 00:10:37,608
You're under arrest -- again.
Freegan rights.

245
00:10:37,651 --> 00:10:38,695
Step over here.

246
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,347
Hands behind your back.
Stay there.

247
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,999
At least your mug shot
and your prints are still good.

248
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:48,260
Excuse me! Officer?

249
00:10:48,303 --> 00:10:50,086
Nolan:
I'll take care of this.

250
00:10:52,825 --> 00:10:54,824
Sorry.
Employee parking only.

251
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:55,650
You want public parking,
it's back --

252
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,172
Don't speak.
Do exactly as I say.

253
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:02,084
Right hand up. Left hand
takes out your radio.

254
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,084
Put it on the seat.

255
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:06,432
Hey. Eyes on me.

256
00:11:06,475 --> 00:11:08,040
Radio. Now. Let's go.

257
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:13,083
Now both hands
unhook your belt.

258
00:11:13,126 --> 00:11:15,083
Put it on the ground.

259
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:19,430
Your backup piece next.
Come on. I know you got one.

260
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:25,343
Climb in
and shut the door.

261
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:31,081
Into the back.
And don't even think about

262
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,950
trying to charge me,
Officer...

263
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:35,689
Nolan.

264
00:11:35,732 --> 00:11:37,732
Let's go.

265
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,949
Is that a --
Big-ass bomb? Oh, yeah.

266
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:50,035
I set that baby off, everybody
in a two-block radius is dead.

267
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:57,600
You see those handcuffs on
the side wall? Put them on.

268
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,817
Tight. Let's go.

269
00:12:07,034 --> 00:12:08,773
Tighter than that, man.

270
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:19,250
You know what this is?

271
00:12:20,685 --> 00:12:22,989
That's a dead man's switch.

272
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:24,466
That's right.

273
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,162
Anything doesn't go my way,
I release this, we go boom.

274
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,379
You try and be a hero,
I release this, and we go boom.

275
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,683
Nolan, you so much as look at me
funny, I release this --

276
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:36,901
And we go boom. I get it.

277
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:38,465
You're not gonna get
any trouble from me.

278
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,465
I want to make it through this,
and I hope you do, too.

279
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:42,856
I'm imagining you have some

280
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,030
pretty powerful motivations
for doing this?

281
00:12:45,074 --> 00:12:46,813
Shut up, man. You and I
are not gonna be friends.

282
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:51,073
Get your supervisor
on a private channel.

283
00:12:51,116 --> 00:12:53,681
Sgt. Grey: So, Nolan
aced the test.
I knew he would.

284
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:55,507
Sergeant Grey,
this is Officer Nolan.

285
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,115
Go to channel 9.

286
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,507
Why is your rookie radioing me
from the front desk?

287
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,159
Nolan, this better
be important.

288
00:13:03,202 --> 00:13:05,593
It sure is, buddy.

289
00:13:06,811 --> 00:13:08,419
Who's this?
The guy
in your parking lot

290
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:10,679
with an ammonium nitrate
fertilizer bomb

291
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:12,505
powerful enough
to turn your station

292
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:14,810
and the surrounding
neighborhood into a crater.

293
00:13:14,853 --> 00:13:18,026
If you think I'm lying,
you can ask Officer Nolan here.

294
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,070
I'm afraid
I can confirm that, sir.

295
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:22,721
Graham: Now, I know your first
instinct is going to be to

296
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:25,460
evacuate the building,
but that is not gonna happen.

297
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:28,678
I have cameras on every exit.
Do you understand me?

298
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,764
If anyone leaves, everyone dies.

299
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:34,025
I can confirm
the cameras, sir.

300
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:36,285
Secure all exits now.
Graham: Then your next instinct

301
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:38,372
will be to try
and neutralize me.

302
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:40,850
But tell him why that would be
a mistake, Officer Nolan.

303
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:43,111
Our bomber has
a dead man's switch, sir.

304
00:13:45,154 --> 00:13:48,328
Okay. You have my attention.
Tell me what I can do for you.

305
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:51,631
Rectify an extreme  miscarriage of justice.

306
00:13:51,675 --> 00:13:54,457
I demand the immediate release
of Donald Feltt

307
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,675
from the Primedale
Department of Corrections.

308
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,892
Hold on.

309
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:04,500
So, are we talking about
Donald Feltt who's serving

310
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,195
a life sentence for murder
and drug trafficking?

311
00:14:07,239 --> 00:14:09,934
That's him.
And there's  not gonna be a backdoor  parole for my boy.

312
00:14:09,978 --> 00:14:11,760
Feltt walks
out of there today.

313
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:13,194
Backdoor parole?

314
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:14,673
Jailhouse slang for
when you die in prison.

315
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:15,933
Our bomber's done time.

316
00:14:15,977 --> 00:14:18,020
Most likely with Feltt.

317
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:20,846
All right. That's a big ask.
It'll take time.

318
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,237
Well, then get started.

319
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,976
We need someone on the outside
to go to Primedale.

320
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:27,193
I'll call Lopez.
She left already.

321
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:29,845
So, all units,
be advised we are going into

322
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:32,323
tactical alert
at Mid-Wilshire Station.

323
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:34,323
All civilians
and non-essential personnel

324
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:37,236
report to Level D
of the underground garage.

325
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,757
Level D? That's where
the station sheltered in place

326
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:41,062
during the missile alert.

327
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:43,235
What the hell is going on?

328
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:45,365
Uh, listen up. I need everyone
to get up and come with me.

329
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:47,148
Why? What's going on?

330
00:14:47,191 --> 00:14:48,843
I'm sorry, ma'am. Someone will
explain everything shortly.

331
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:50,191
Right now I need you
to follow me.

332
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,190
Letting me go again?
This station's awesome!

333
00:14:57,234 --> 00:14:58,842
We're going down to the bottom
of the parking garage.

334
00:14:58,886 --> 00:15:00,103
Safety drill.

335
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:02,320
Yeah. I don't want to do that.
Tough.

336
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:05,754
Listen up.
We are in lockdown.

337
00:15:05,798 --> 00:15:07,406
Head to the underground garage,
bottom level.

338
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:08,754
This is not a drill.

339
00:15:08,798 --> 00:15:10,536
We can't.
Evidence-room employees

340
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,449
aren't allowed to interact
with police personnel.

341
00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:14,232
Well, then, stand in a corner
and don't talk to anyone,

342
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:16,101
but you can't stay here.

343
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:28,578
You okay?

344
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:30,273
I'm fine.

345
00:15:30,317 --> 00:15:32,230
You're really putting a lot on
the line for this Feltt guy.

346
00:15:32,273 --> 00:15:33,969
He must be pretty important
to you.

347
00:15:34,012 --> 00:15:35,969
Why do you say
he was wrongly accused?

348
00:15:36,012 --> 00:15:37,925
I told you. You and I
are not gonna be friends.

349
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:39,751
I'm just trying to
make the best of this.

350
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:42,664
Well, stop.

351
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:45,750
That a chemo port
on your chest there?

352
00:15:45,794 --> 00:15:49,011
My aunt had one.
Colon cancer.

353
00:15:49,054 --> 00:15:50,794
Pancreatic.

354
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:53,967
I'm sorry.
Don't be.

355
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,967
Means I got
nothing left to lose.

356
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,053
So, what, you're dying,
and you want your last act

357
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:02,835
to be murdering hundreds
of innocent people?

358
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,443
Well, they only die
if your sergeant

359
00:16:04,487 --> 00:16:06,922
doesn't hold up
his end of the deal.

360
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,835
See, it's a matter
of perspective.

361
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,661
Then help me
see your side.

362
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,443
I told you. You and I are
not gonna be friends,

363
00:16:12,487 --> 00:16:13,791
so shut the hell up.

364
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,438
I'm sorry. I cannot be in here.
I get claustrophobic!

365
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,829
I understand, but this is
the safest place for you to be.

366
00:16:59,873 --> 00:17:02,481
Yeah, until the bomb goes off
and the whole structure
collapses on us.

367
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:04,524
Hey. Okay.
That is not gonna happen.

368
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:07,176
This place was designed to be
a bomb and earthquake shelter.

369
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,394
Okay?
Just take a breath.

370
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:10,654
Ugh.
Of this stale-ass air?

371
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,436
Do you have any idea
the long-term health effects

372
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,610
of breathing
carbon monoxide?

373
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:16,828
No, but I bet it's
a hell of a lot better
than getting blown up.

374
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,653
And where are yougoing?
Back to work.

375
00:17:19,696 --> 00:17:21,132
While we're stuck
in the station,

376
00:17:21,175 --> 00:17:23,392
Jackson is out there with Doug
with no backup.

377
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:24,958
Did something happen?
Well, not yet.

378
00:17:25,001 --> 00:17:27,261
I mean, Jackson feels like
he sold his apology to Doug,

379
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:28,783
but I don't trust it.

380
00:17:28,826 --> 00:17:30,652
I don't, either. Tell Jackson
to keep his head down today

381
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:32,521
since we can't be there
for him.

382
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:35,173
We're gonna stay right here.

383
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:39,956
Big Mike.
What do you got?

384
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:42,130
Hostage barricade
with a mobile WMD.

385
00:17:42,173 --> 00:17:43,346
Who's the hostage?

386
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,085
The trouble magnet.
That old rookie.

387
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:46,520
Nolan?
That's the one.

388
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:48,955
This is my boot, Jackson West.
He's interested in SWAT.

389
00:17:48,998 --> 00:17:50,389
Well, if there's still
a Mid-Wilshire tomorrow,
hit me up.

390
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:51,868
Any friend of Dougie's.

391
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:53,737
Snipers, spotters.
You got your assignments.

392
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,128
Let's move out.
Let's go.

393
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:57,867
What should we do?
Support SWAT?
Negative.

394
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,867
We're the only patrol unit
left outside the building.

395
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,780
Now every thug, lowlife,
and banger in the city's

396
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:03,431
gonna know we're
vulnerable right now.

397
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:04,736
We got to
get back out there,

398
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,344
show them you can't mess
with the LAPD.

399
00:18:24,386 --> 00:18:26,473
Hey!

400
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:29,559
Hey. Hey! Wake up!

401
00:18:29,602 --> 00:18:33,559
Hey! Hey! Geez.
Wake up!

402
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:41,210
Wake up! Hey! Don't let go!
Wake up! Wake up!

403
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,210
Come on! Don't let go!
Wake up! Get up!

404
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,383
What happened?
What happened?

405
00:18:51,426 --> 00:18:52,904
Keep a grip on it.
Tighten your grip.
Tighten your grip!

406
00:18:52,948 --> 00:18:54,817
Tighten it!
I got it. I got it! I got it!

407
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:55,817
Yeah. You passed out.
I've got it!

408
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:57,599
You passed out!

409
00:18:57,643 --> 00:18:59,904
You almost killed everyone.

410
00:18:59,948 --> 00:19:02,556
My blood pressure must've
bottomed out.

411
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,860
It happens sometimes.

412
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:07,511
Well, given that fun fact,
how about we disconnect

413
00:19:07,555 --> 00:19:08,816
the dead man's switch?

414
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,468
It's not happening.

415
00:19:13,511 --> 00:19:16,076
I'm fine.

416
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:40,813
Sergeant? You seeing this?

417
00:19:40,856 --> 00:19:42,465
Van, rear window.

418
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:43,812
Got it.

419
00:19:43,856 --> 00:19:46,812
Is that...

420
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:48,159
Morse code.

421
00:19:48,203 --> 00:19:49,594
I'll look up
a dictionary.

422
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:50,898
Hold on.
Hold on.

423
00:19:50,942 --> 00:19:55,811
S-C-R-L-I.

424
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:58,202
S-C-R -- is that "scar"?
Left eye.

425
00:19:58,245 --> 00:19:59,811
Suspect has a scar
on his left eye.

426
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:02,506
Good man, Nolan.
Okay. So if we assume
our bomber

427
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:04,202
did time at Primedale
with Feltt,

428
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,114
we know that he's a white male
with a scar on his left eye...

429
00:20:07,157 --> 00:20:10,157
Graham Porter.

430
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:11,983
Uh, he did three years
at Primedale,

431
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:13,940
and before that
a string of misdemeanors.

432
00:20:13,983 --> 00:20:15,983
But nothing that screams out
"mad bomber."

433
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:18,200
How does a guy like this hook up
with a lifer like Feltt?

434
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:20,156
Let's hope Lopez can find out.

435
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,808
Donald Feltt came to us
nine years ago

436
00:20:21,852 --> 00:20:23,765
for a murder that would have
made Dahmer blush.

437
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:25,634
Any friends?
Known associates?

438
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:27,590
Inmates like Feltt
don't have friends.

439
00:20:27,634 --> 00:20:30,807
What about Graham Porter?
A former inmate of yours.

440
00:20:30,851 --> 00:20:32,589
Doesn't ring a bell.

441
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,241
Huh.
What?

442
00:20:37,285 --> 00:20:40,415
Well, he was in our level one
minimum-security unit.

443
00:20:40,459 --> 00:20:42,893
Those inmates never cross paths
with guys in the SHU.

444
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:47,892
Then why is Graham risking
his life to save Feltt?

445
00:20:47,936 --> 00:20:49,197
Unless...

446
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,414
Unless what?

447
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,762
This isn't about Feltt at all.

448
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:54,631
I need to know what happened to
Graham after he left prison.

449
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:02,804
You have been glued
to your phone.

450
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:05,848
Who you texting?
None of your business.

451
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:08,282
Someone you care about?

452
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:09,629
Someone you're
saying goodbye to?

453
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:15,063
You know,
everyone in that station

454
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:19,020
has someone they care about,
someone who loves them,

455
00:21:19,063 --> 00:21:21,802
someone who's worried they won't
ever see them alive again.

456
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:26,062
Yeah. Well, we all got to die
someday, don't we, Officer?

457
00:21:26,106 --> 00:21:29,193
Today's as good a day
as any other.

458
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:34,931
Time for a shot
across the bow.

459
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,583
Control, 7-Adam-07.

460
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:38,800
Show us on West Adams and 14th.

461
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:41,061
Code 6.
What are we
doing here?

462
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:43,147
Sending a message.

463
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:44,973
We want them to let all their
little homies know that

464
00:21:45,017 --> 00:21:48,234
even though we're wounded,
we're not down.

465
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:50,191
But they don't
look like much to me.

466
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:52,190
Well, looks
can be deceiving.

467
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:54,972
Especially on a day like
this, we can't show
any signs of weakness.

468
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:56,711
Got to hit the bully
before they hit you.

469
00:21:58,407 --> 00:21:59,580
Hey!
Fingers on the fender, boys.

470
00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:03,580
Why?
We're not doing anything wrong.

471
00:22:03,624 --> 00:22:05,754
Can't work on cars in
the street, ese.

472
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:08,319
Fingers on the hood.
We're not doing repairs, ese.

473
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:09,579
I'm just showing them
the engine.

474
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:11,449
Hands on the hood now.

475
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:13,101
Screw that.
You got no cause.

476
00:22:13,144 --> 00:22:15,188
What are you,
some kind of lawyer?

477
00:22:15,231 --> 00:22:16,578
Pre-law at SMC, actually.

478
00:22:16,622 --> 00:22:18,665
Are you threatening me?

479
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,578
You know what happens when you
threaten a badge?

480
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:24,013
Doug.

481
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:25,795
Officer West, I thought you had
my six.

482
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:27,143
I do.
Then watch those two

483
00:22:27,187 --> 00:22:29,187
while I deal with
Mr. Lawyer here.

484
00:22:29,229 --> 00:22:33,664
Hey, hey, hey.
Stop, stop.

485
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:36,142
Look, you three, back in your
car, have a nice day.

486
00:22:36,186 --> 00:22:37,620
Sorry for the trouble.

487
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:48,098
You're done, Boot -- what you
just did is a fireable offense.

488
00:22:48,141 --> 00:22:49,445
I'm going straight
to the city manager.

489
00:22:49,488 --> 00:22:51,619
I don't care if your daddy
works for I.A.

490
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,532
He's not gonna be able
to save you now.

491
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:57,487
You know what, dumbass?

492
00:22:57,531 --> 00:23:00,661
My daddy,
he doesn't work for I.A.

493
00:23:00,705 --> 00:23:02,052
He runs it.

494
00:23:02,096 --> 00:23:04,617
So if you're coming for my job,
he'll come for yours.

495
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:09,095
You know, I-I'm done tiptoeing
around your racist ass.

496
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,225
You're a dead man walking.

497
00:23:11,269 --> 00:23:13,182
7-Adam-07. Status check.

498
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,790
Are you Code 4 on your stop?

499
00:23:19,834 --> 00:23:21,529
Yeah.
All good.

500
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,396
How long did Graham Porterlive in your halfway house?

501
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,832
Almost three months.
Is he in trouble?

502
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,266
You could say that.
Doesn't surprise me.

503
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:41,353
Graham's the unluckiest man
alive.

504
00:23:41,396 --> 00:23:43,744
Gets out of prison determined
to get his life on track.

505
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:45,831
Finds a job, falls in love,

506
00:23:45,874 --> 00:23:48,613
then he gets hit with
Stage 4 cancer.

507
00:23:48,656 --> 00:23:49,830
That's rough.

508
00:23:49,873 --> 00:23:52,395
He has no money
for doctors, no insurance.

509
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:54,438
He started one of those
YouFundMe things,

510
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:58,743
but it barely covered
his first round of chemo.

511
00:23:58,786 --> 00:24:01,742
Last I heard, he was in danger
of ending up on the street.

512
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:04,742
So, Graham Porter is in
desperate need of money.

513
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:06,132
So why not demand a ransom?

514
00:24:06,176 --> 00:24:07,567
Why give us the head fake
on Feltt?

515
00:24:07,611 --> 00:24:08,828
Well, maybe it's not
a head fake.

516
00:24:08,871 --> 00:24:09,915
Maybe Feltt's paying Graham

517
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:11,523
to bust him out of prison.

518
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:13,132
No, Feltt's a murderer,
not a narco

519
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:15,218
with unlimited cash flow --
if this Feltt gambit is smoke,

520
00:24:15,262 --> 00:24:16,653
we're chasing our tails trying
to free him.

521
00:24:16,697 --> 00:24:18,697
Meanwhile, an accomplice robs
a bank or something.

522
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:21,131
Hollywood division did evacuate
the area around the station.

523
00:24:21,175 --> 00:24:24,435
It's standard procedure,
and Graham would know that.

524
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:26,696
Bradford, Chen, make a list of
every high-value target

525
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,695
around here -- cash businesses,
high-end shopping...

526
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:31,521
There's a check-cashing place
two blocks south of here.

527
00:24:31,564 --> 00:24:33,347
Contact Stanton and West.
Have them check it out.

528
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:34,956
I'm gonna call the chief, see if
we can get some extra units

529
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,216
around here to help out.

530
00:24:38,216 --> 00:24:40,650
Doug: Look, I know we both
got heated back there,

531
00:24:40,694 --> 00:24:41,738
said things
we didn't mean --

532
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,173
I meant what I said.

533
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:48,346
Listen, I got a wife,
two kids.

534
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:50,606
Everybody
you jacked up for no reason

535
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:53,780
has a family --
it didn't stop you.

536
00:24:55,997 --> 00:24:57,649
The storefront looks empty,

537
00:24:57,692 --> 00:25:00,779
but I'll check the doors.

538
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:08,387
Jackson says everything is
Code 4

539
00:25:08,431 --> 00:25:10,691
at the check-cashing place,
there's no sign of trouble.

540
00:25:10,735 --> 00:25:12,996
Not at any of the other
high-value targets, either.

541
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,343
Maybe we're going down
the wrong path.

542
00:25:14,386 --> 00:25:15,560
Maybe this is not
about money at all.

543
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:16,821
What the hell is it about?

544
00:25:16,864 --> 00:25:18,430
Uh, we did some digging
into Graham.

545
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:20,951
His YouFundMe was set up by
his girlfriend, Kelsey Adams.

546
00:25:20,995 --> 00:25:22,472
Have Lopez run her down.
We did,

547
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:24,124
but there's no one home
at her apartment.

548
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:26,255
But there's something weird.
This whole thing is weird.

549
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:28,081
Kelsey is using
an assumed identity.

550
00:25:28,124 --> 00:25:30,471
We ran her through the system.
Social Security number's a fake.

551
00:25:30,515 --> 00:25:31,776
We can't find
a driver's license for her.

552
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,950
So we don't have a picture.
No, sir.

553
00:25:32,994 --> 00:25:34,558
But according to Lopez,
Kelsey and Graham

554
00:25:34,602 --> 00:25:36,644
have been inseparable
since they first met.

555
00:25:36,688 --> 00:25:38,644
So it's likely she's involved
in this somehow.

556
00:25:38,688 --> 00:25:41,166
Yeah, but how if it's
not about money or Feltt?

557
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:45,992
What if this is all
a distraction meant to pull

558
00:25:46,035 --> 00:25:48,122
our focus outside the station,

559
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,469
when we should be focused
inside?

560
00:25:50,513 --> 00:25:53,121
What kind of woman would be
crazy enough to be in a building

561
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:54,904
with her boyfriend
parked outside in a truck

562
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:56,947
full of explosives?

563
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:59,773
The kind that would get herself
arrested twice in one hour.

564
00:25:59,817 --> 00:26:01,164
Freegan Frida.

565
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:02,468
Hey, what's going on?

566
00:26:02,512 --> 00:26:03,773
We're just trapped in here.
Is it over yet?

567
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:05,598
Uh, not yet.
Tim: Chen.

568
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:09,033
Dude, please tell me you brought
snacks. I'm starving.

569
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:11,163
It's over, Kelsey.
Who's Kelsey?

570
00:26:11,206 --> 00:26:12,816
You got yourself arrested
this morning,

571
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:14,467
but we let you go
too quickly.

572
00:26:14,511 --> 00:26:16,510
That's why you had to break that
window to get yourself back in.

573
00:26:16,553 --> 00:26:18,379
So you'd be in the station when
Graham made his demands.

574
00:26:18,423 --> 00:26:20,032
Only we put you down here,
and you can't get

575
00:26:20,076 --> 00:26:21,292
back in the station
without a key card.

576
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:23,727
The only question
left is why?

577
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,683
What's so important
in the station?

578
00:26:26,727 --> 00:26:29,118
Dude, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

579
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:31,378
But I'm super intrigued.

580
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,813
Kelsey Adams!

581
00:26:36,856 --> 00:26:38,769
Tim: Stop her!

582
00:26:47,376 --> 00:26:49,246
She must've broken it.

583
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:51,420
Nolan: Come on.
Who have you been texting?

584
00:26:51,463 --> 00:26:54,159
I mean, clearly, it's your
accomplice, but has to be

585
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:56,593
someone important to you for you
to risk your life like this.

586
00:26:56,636 --> 00:26:57,811
Can't be a friend. No.

587
00:26:57,854 --> 00:27:00,767
This scheme
is too dangerous.

588
00:27:00,811 --> 00:27:02,375
Slim chance of escape.

589
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:07,027
Maybe family?

590
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:09,679
A brother perhaps?
Sister?

591
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:12,026
How about a girlfriend?
I don't know what you're
talking about, all right?

592
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,809
Girlfriend it is.
Okay.

593
00:27:13,852 --> 00:27:17,243
I understand the hesitation --
you don't want her ID'd.

594
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:19,547
That's a good thing,
actually.

595
00:27:19,591 --> 00:27:21,460
It means you think you'll
get away with this.

596
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:24,590
No, I don't.

597
00:27:24,633 --> 00:27:26,546
But you think she will.

598
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:47,066
Sergeant, this is Harper --
Evidence room door

599
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:48,892
has been breached,
I'm starting a search.

600
00:28:03,152 --> 00:28:04,412
Don't move.

601
00:28:04,455 --> 00:28:05,760
Please, I have to find it!

602
00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:07,325
Find what?!

603
00:28:07,368 --> 00:28:09,716
He thinks I'm dead.
If they run my prints...

604
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,020
Are you trying to
destroy evidence

605
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,064
from a crime you committed?
No!

606
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:15,020
If he finds me,
he will kill me.

607
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:17,759
Who?

608
00:28:17,802 --> 00:28:21,715
My husband.
He's a loan shark in El Paso.

609
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:24,758
He beat me up
on the regular.

610
00:28:24,802 --> 00:28:26,715
So I ran away
three years ago.

611
00:28:26,758 --> 00:28:29,757
I paid for a new identity --
birth certificate, the works --

612
00:28:29,801 --> 00:28:31,583
just so he would
never find me.

613
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,496
But last week, there was
a robbery in the restaurant

614
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,278
where I work.

615
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:37,583
The cops took a bunch of
stuff into evidence,

616
00:28:37,626 --> 00:28:39,625
things that I had touched.
And when they pull the prints,

617
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:41,974
they will get a hit
on the real you.

618
00:28:42,017 --> 00:28:45,800
And he'll find me,
and he will kill me.

619
00:28:45,842 --> 00:28:49,668
Why go through all this?
Why not just call the cops?

620
00:28:49,712 --> 00:28:51,668
He's got cops
on his payroll.

621
00:28:51,712 --> 00:28:53,668
They reported
me missing.

622
00:28:53,712 --> 00:28:56,233
The minute my prints show up
in the system, they'll know,

623
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,754
and they'll tell him
where to find me.

624
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:06,319
Please...

625
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:08,101
do not let him find me.

626
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:16,883
All right.
I will try and help you.

627
00:29:16,926 --> 00:29:18,578
But right now, you have
got to do the right thing,

628
00:29:18,621 --> 00:29:21,186
and you have to tell
Graham to stand down.

629
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,578
Graham Porter.
You there?

630
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:35,229
How do you know my name?
I know everything.

631
00:29:35,272 --> 00:29:38,055
I know this whole thing's about
trying to protect Kelsey.

632
00:29:38,098 --> 00:29:40,445
She's here in custody.

633
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,967
Release her.
Do it now.

634
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,141
I can't do that,
but I'll make you a deal.

635
00:29:45,184 --> 00:29:46,880
No!

636
00:29:46,923 --> 00:29:48,010
You set her free
right now,

637
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:50,183
or I blow this bomb
and we all die.

638
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:52,009
Graham, she told us the truth.

639
00:29:52,053 --> 00:29:56,053
The bomb is a fake.
It's over.

640
00:29:58,617 --> 00:30:00,009
You're under arrest.

641
00:30:00,053 --> 00:30:02,400
No.

642
00:30:02,443 --> 00:30:04,660
No, I'm not.

643
00:30:08,312 --> 00:30:11,268
Guys, get locked in.
We're going in five.

644
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:15,094
Tell your SWAT to back off
or I shoot your officer.

645
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:16,528
Do it now!

646
00:30:16,572 --> 00:30:20,137
Sgt. Grey:
Okay, okay, just hold on.

647
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,093
Graham,
this has to stop.

648
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,745
You can barely stand.

649
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,353
I can still
pull a trigger.

650
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:31,962
You're not gonna shoot me.

651
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:33,223
You think I care about
going back to prison?

652
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,875
At least there my chemo
would be paid for,

653
00:30:38,918 --> 00:30:41,657
instead of being left to
rot from the inside out.

654
00:30:41,701 --> 00:30:44,048
That may be true,

655
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:47,221
but you wouldn't just be
condemning yourself to prison.

656
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:50,177
You'd be condemning
Kelsey, too.

657
00:30:50,221 --> 00:30:54,568
If you kill me, she becomes
an accomplice to murder.

658
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:56,177
That's a life sentence.

659
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,089
For you, that might
not be very long.

660
00:30:58,133 --> 00:30:59,699
But for Kelsey...

661
00:30:59,742 --> 00:31:01,089
I just wanted to do
something good

662
00:31:01,133 --> 00:31:03,394
before I died,
that's it.

663
00:31:03,437 --> 00:31:05,698
She deserves
to be happy.

664
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:07,175
I know.

665
00:31:07,219 --> 00:31:08,132
Right.

666
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:10,349
So, help her.

667
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:14,045
You -- Promise to
talk to the DA,

668
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:17,653
pull some strings,
something.

669
00:31:17,697 --> 00:31:20,522
Graham, if I promised
you that, I'd be lying.

670
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:22,826
I don't have
any power.

671
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,000
I'm just a rookie.
No one's gonna listen to me.

672
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:28,999
Her fate's in
your hands now.

673
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,129
I -- I c--

674
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:55,214
Sergeant Grey,
this is Officer Nolan.

675
00:31:55,257 --> 00:31:57,649
One in custody.

676
00:31:57,693 --> 00:31:58,996
We're Code 4.

677
00:32:09,474 --> 00:32:11,213
Units -- information only.

678
00:32:11,256 --> 00:32:13,647
The hostage barricade
at Mid-Wilshire is Code 4.

679
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:15,299
Processing is open.
No injuries.

680
00:32:15,342 --> 00:32:18,255
Complete Code 4.

681
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:20,777
You know, back in the day,
when something good like this

682
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,080
would happen, we used to
do mic clicks.

683
00:32:24,124 --> 00:32:26,037
Three of 'em.

684
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,993
Go ahead.

685
00:32:47,252 --> 00:32:50,382
Woman: Hey, attaboy!

686
00:32:50,425 --> 00:32:51,817
It'd be nice to be applauded for
something other than

687
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:54,164
almost dying.
How are you feeling?

688
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,121
Uh, a little wobbly, sir,
but ready to hit the streets.

689
00:32:56,164 --> 00:32:58,990
I appreciate your eagerness,
but you are end-of-shift.

690
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:01,729
As for everyone else,
back to work, people.

691
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:04,815
We're Code 4.
Pending calls are piled up.

692
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:08,728
Oh, and, Nolan...
good assist on the Morse code.

693
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:11,076
Oh. Eight years of Boy Scouts
finally paid off.

694
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,206
Dot-dot-dot-dash.

695
00:33:13,249 --> 00:33:15,293
Morse code joke.
It's "V" for "victory."

696
00:33:15,336 --> 00:33:16,858
It's -- It's...

697
00:33:16,901 --> 00:33:18,814
So, I just got a text
from Jackson.

698
00:33:18,858 --> 00:33:20,727
It looks like things
came to a head with Doug.

699
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:22,814
He pulled the dad card
and got him to back off.

700
00:33:22,858 --> 00:33:24,857
Damn it.
We got to get out there.

701
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,770
Guys like Doug don't like being
backed into a corner.

702
00:33:26,813 --> 00:33:28,292
Come on.

703
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:41,159
Could they have been
more obvious?

704
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:44,333
But I don't want you
and the PC police to accuse me

705
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:46,724
of profiling.
No, they were
suspicious as hell.

706
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:48,637
Missing plate means
the vehicle is likely stolen.

707
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,115
Let's take a look.

708
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,419
Dispatch, 7-Adam-07.

709
00:33:55,463 --> 00:33:56,854
Show us Code 6
at the Manor Apartments.

710
00:33:56,897 --> 00:33:58,854
Premise check.
Manor Apartments.

711
00:33:58,897 --> 00:34:00,636
That's 6H -- why aren't
they calling for backup?

712
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,244
They think they
have it covered?

713
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:04,505
No, you don't step foot in that
place without hats and bats.

714
00:34:17,242 --> 00:34:19,895
Jackson: 7-Adam-07.
We're 10-97 on the 11-54

715
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:21,286
at the Manor Apartments.

716
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:28,894
Five-oh!

717
00:34:28,938 --> 00:34:29,937
They know we're here.

718
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,024
It's the five-oh!

719
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,197
We should call for more units.
Not yet.

720
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,936
Come in too strong, the whole
place will turn on us.

721
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,240
I got this way.
Okay.

722
00:34:42,284 --> 00:34:44,457
Boot, you see anything,
call me.

723
00:35:19,758 --> 00:35:22,019
Control, 7-Adam-07, A to B.
I'm out with three.

724
00:35:22,062 --> 00:35:24,193
Copy. Right behind you.
Y'all live here?

725
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:27,540
All right, do me a favor,gentlemen,
keep your hands where I can see them.

726
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,279
Hey, stop where you are -- look,
you guys do not want to do this.

727
00:35:30,322 --> 00:35:31,713
Look, stop where you are! Hey!

728
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,104
Aah!

729
00:35:37,147 --> 00:35:38,408
Take this!

730
00:36:20,056 --> 00:36:21,795
That's their shop.

731
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:27,447
Where do you think they are?
Someplace they shouldn't be.

732
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,489
7-Adam-07, what's your 20?

733
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:32,012
Control, 7-Adam-19.

734
00:36:32,055 --> 00:36:34,315
Requesting additional units,
Manor Apartments, Code 3.

735
00:36:40,011 --> 00:36:41,271
I lost Jackson.
We got separated.

736
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:06,443
He's still breathing.
He's still breathing.

737
00:37:06,486 --> 00:37:09,268
7-Adam-19, we need an ambulance
to our location.

738
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:14,398
Officer down, 24-year-old male,
full body trauma.

739
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:17,050
Hey, partner, what happened?
What happened, partner?

740
00:37:17,094 --> 00:37:18,702
Who did this to you?

741
00:37:22,397 --> 00:37:26,962
What?
Camera.

742
00:37:54,177 --> 00:37:56,480
I've seen enough.

743
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,742
On me.

744
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:02,567
...see what happened?
Oh, we got separated.

745
00:38:02,611 --> 00:38:04,741
Okay.
Officer
Doug Stanton...

746
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,566
Got it.

747
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,001
Hold on. Hold on.
I want to see this.

748
00:38:09,044 --> 00:38:11,305
I am hereby placing you under
administrative leave

749
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:14,218
effective immediately --
gun and badge.

750
00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:15,609
Back off.
Give me a reason.

751
00:38:19,653 --> 00:38:21,043
You will not
leave town.

752
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:23,087
You will not act as a police
officer in any capacity,

753
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,521
including court.

754
00:38:24,564 --> 00:38:26,782
You will make yourself available
to the Chief of Police

755
00:38:26,826 --> 00:38:28,347
within 30 minutes notice.

756
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,477
Pending review, you will be
brought up before

757
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:31,825
a board of rights.

758
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:33,433
This isn't over.

759
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:34,738
No.

760
00:38:34,781 --> 00:38:36,086
But you are.

761
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:06,909
Hey, you heading
over to see Jackson?

762
00:39:06,951 --> 00:39:09,256
Yeah.
Yeah. Me, too.

763
00:39:09,299 --> 00:39:12,125
You okay?
Yeah.

764
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:13,559
Don't lie to your T.O.

765
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:15,951
I know what you went through
today was scary.

766
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:18,647
If you need any help,
don't be afraid to ask.

767
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,429
I won't, I promise,
but today actually

768
00:39:20,472 --> 00:39:22,081
gave me a lot of
perspective.

769
00:39:22,124 --> 00:39:23,558
Well, almost dying
will do that.

770
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:27,949
Right? I've actually been so
wrapped up in getting ahead,

771
00:39:27,993 --> 00:39:30,470
promotions, making detective,
I think I lost sight as to

772
00:39:30,514 --> 00:39:33,296
why I became a cop
in the first place.

773
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,862
To help people.

774
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,992
Well, you definitely
did that today.

775
00:39:37,035 --> 00:39:41,209
Thank you, but maybe I can
help more from in here.

776
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,165
Guys like Doug Stanton
should not be training

777
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:46,165
our next generation of cops,
so maybe I should stop

778
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:48,686
thinking about catching bad guys
and start focusing on

779
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:52,338
training good ones,
the way you do.

780
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:55,425
Well, you know, if you had your
college degree, technically,

781
00:39:55,468 --> 00:39:58,729
you would be able to be
T.O. in two years.

782
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,251
Without one,
you'd have to wait four.

783
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:04,250
Looks like I'm
going back to school.

784
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:21,814
Hey, Sarge.

785
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:25,335
You, uh,
just missed my parents.

786
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:28,726
Uh, yeah, yeah, I just
saw them in the hallway.

787
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:30,813
They said you're
gonna be okay.

788
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:33,464
Yeah -- cracked rib,
couple loose teeth.

789
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:35,855
CT was clean.

790
00:40:35,899 --> 00:40:37,594
Who knew that
getting my ass kicked

791
00:40:37,638 --> 00:40:39,507
would get this thing done?

792
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,986
You could've died.

793
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:42,420
Yeah, well,
it was worth it

794
00:40:42,463 --> 00:40:44,941
to get the needle moving
in the right direction.

795
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:50,158
You shouldn't have to risk your
life to get a bad cop fired.

796
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:52,375
Hey, don't do that.

797
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:55,332
Look, if you cry,
then I'm gonna cry, and --

798
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,810
and I'll straight up
pop a stitch.

799
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,071
Ain't nobody crying.

800
00:41:01,723 --> 00:41:03,200
And you better not tell
Officer Chen

801
00:41:03,244 --> 00:41:05,765
that I got all
misty-eyed, either.

802
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:08,373
I'll, uh, keep that
between you and me, sir.

803
00:41:08,417 --> 00:41:10,591
I appreciate that,
but here's something

804
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:13,199
you can tell everyone --

805
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:16,721
the honor and bravery
you've shown...

806
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:18,459
is an example
to all of us.

807
00:41:22,807 --> 00:41:24,937
And I'm so damn
proud of you.

808
00:41:31,328 --> 00:41:33,588
Thank you
so much, sir.

809
00:41:33,632 --> 00:41:36,197
No, thank you, son...

810
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:40,066
for reminding me
what this job should be.

811
00:41:42,022 --> 00:41:44,761
Look, you, uh --
you get some rest, okay?

812
00:41:44,805 --> 00:41:49,239
Um...we still got
a lot of work ahead of us.

813
00:41:49,282 --> 00:41:51,804
Yeah.
Hey, I, uh...

814
00:41:51,847 --> 00:41:54,499
get to take tomorrow off,
though, right?

815
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:55,934
Yeah, if you're trying
to be a slacker.

816
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:58,891
Ow. Ow...

817
00:42:01,194 --> 00:42:04,629
Uh, you just --
just get some rest.

818
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:54,102
Damn it!

819
