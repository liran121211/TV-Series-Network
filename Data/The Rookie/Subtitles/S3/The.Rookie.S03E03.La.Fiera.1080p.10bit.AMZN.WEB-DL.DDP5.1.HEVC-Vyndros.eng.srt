I expect every officer here

When you see the suspect,

93

94

side, it is an automatic fail.

two magazine changes.

You're gonna have to
tell them soon, Wade.

351
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:22,236
They love you around here.

352
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,064
They're gonna want a chance
to say goodbye.

353
00:13:24,107 --> 00:13:27,023
Still can't believe
how that doctor talked to her.

354
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,547
Oh, there's plenty more
where he came from.

355
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:31,158
Sounds like you're talking
from experience.

356
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:34,422
Well, after Lila was born,

357
00:13:34,465 --> 00:13:36,032
I-I-I knew something was wrong,

358
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:38,339
but the doctor just said
I was being dramatic.

359
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:42,430
But honestly, if it wasn't
for that nurse...

360
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:45,563
I-I will never forget the look
on Donovan's face

361
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,870
when I was being wheeled
into surgery.

362
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:51,178
He was holding Lila,
and she was just so small and --

363
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,180
and fragile and I just --

364
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:55,660
I thought I'd never
see them again.

365
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,749
I'm sorry.
You deserved better than that.

366
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,621
Yeah. I did.

367
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:02,102
Uh, excuse me. Hi. Yes?

368
00:14:02,145 --> 00:14:03,930
Are you Dr. Peterson? Yes.

369
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:05,932
We have a woman who is in labor,

370
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:07,498
and she's showing signs
of pre-eclampsia.

371
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,413
I'm sorry. I already have
a patient in labor.

372
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:10,719
Now you have two.

373
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:12,677
Dr. Kang is the doctor on call.

374
00:14:12,721 --> 00:14:16,899
Would you let Dr. Kang
deliver your baby?

375
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:18,292
He's my boss.

376
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:22,035
What room is she in? She's in 309.

377
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:23,210
I will introduce you to her.

378
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,515
Ah.

379
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:26,648
Sorry.

380
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,128
Mom, this isn't a good time.

381
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,347
<i>John, help! Get away from me!</i>

382
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:31,871
Mom, what's going on?
Who are you speaking to?

383
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,785
<i>I said get away!</i>

384
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,613
Mom?

385
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:36,919
Something's wrong at my house.

386
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,138
My mom's in trouble.

387
00:14:38,181 --> 00:14:39,052
Take the shop. Radio for backup.

388
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,880
Right.

389
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:43,099
♪♪

390
00:14:43,143 --> 00:14:45,014
Hey.

391
00:14:45,058 --> 00:14:46,624
What's going on? Is my mom okay?

392
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:48,278
She's a feisty one.

393
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:50,019
Knows more curse words
than my old drill instructor.

394
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:51,673
Uh, who the hell are you?

395
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,762
I'm Danny Hill.
I'm your mom's fiancé.

396
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:57,026
Ex-fiancé! You cheater!

397
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,723
I'm not a cheater. Evelyn!

398
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:01,465
Liar! I had coffee with Pamela

399
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,424
to tell her about
our engagement.

400
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:05,817
We were married 30 years.
It was the decent thing to do.

401
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,123
I don't believe you.

402
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:08,864
I don't believe
anything you say.

403
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,822
Will you please leave?

404
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:12,781
Okay.

405
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:14,870
Can I just, um,
get the ring back?

406
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:19,309
I don't have it.

407
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,050
Mom, you showed it to me
this morning.

408
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,661
I know, but it -- it --
it was so big

409
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:24,880
it kept slipping off my finger.

410
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,621
Maybe it's around here
somewhere.

411
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:28,231
Mom, just give him back
the ring.

412
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,277
I don't have it.

413
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,843
Is that why
you went downtown today,

414
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,062
so you could sell it
in the diamond district?

415
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:34,020
Of course not.

416
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:35,456
Mom.

417
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:38,546
You barely had it 48 hours.

418
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:40,940
You never actually intended
to marry me, did you?

419
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,290
You scammed me for the ring!

420
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:44,900
Oh, you gold-digging --

421
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,207
Yeah, d--

422
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,034
Still my mom.

423
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,255
I want to file a police report.

424
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:53,691
Good luck with that.

425
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,128
That is your right, sir.

426
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,520
W-What?
Why are you taking his side?

427
00:15:56,564 --> 00:16:00,133
I'm not. This is not a costume.

428
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,526
I am a police officer.

429
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,964
Filing a report is his right.

430
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:08,097
Betrayed by my own son.

431
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:13,233
I'm beginning to think
I dodged a bullet.

432
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,802
You gotta be kidding me.

433
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:20,762
Bad puppy.

434
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:22,329
You sold my car to
buy new clothes?

435
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:23,895
And earrings.

436
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:25,593
It's my car. You gave it to me.

437
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,943
To sleep in, not to sell.

438
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,598
Do you have any idea
what it's like to go to school

439
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:33,296
every day with greasy hair
and dirty clothes?

440
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,603
So, yeah, I sold your
janky-ass ticket magnet

441
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:37,170
and bought a few nice things.

442
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:39,172
I just want to feel normal
for once.

443
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:41,522
And so where's the rest
of the money?

444
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:43,002
It's in my college fund.

445
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,352
Look, why didn't you say
something earlier?

446
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:48,224
You came by this morning.
You clearly already had a buyer.

447
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:50,226
I knew you wouldn't understand.

448
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,098
You would have just said no.

449
00:16:53,273 --> 00:16:55,362
No. Wait.

450
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:57,103
Where are you staying?

451
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,540
With my cousin. Is it safe?

452
00:17:00,802 --> 00:17:02,630

I don't think so.

459
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,256
Uh, the hoodie's green,
not blue.

460
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,911
The suspect is 6 feet.
That guy's too short.

525
00:19:29,472 --> 00:19:31,996
You nabbed an innocent man.
The D.A. won't file.

526
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,042
These people
don't respect authority.

527
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:35,957
You grabbed the wrong guy.

528
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,220
You're senior officer.

529
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:39,308
It's your call.

530
00:19:41,876 --> 00:19:43,965
Control, 7-Adam-19, Code 4.

531
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:46,228
Shut down Code 3 units
and cancel the supervisor.

532
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:47,577
Jackson, come here.

533
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:49,623
Uncuff that gentleman
with an apology.

534
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,015
Talk to the family,
explain the situation.

535
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,800
See if you can
dust them off, okay?

536
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,105
Okay. I'll join you in a minute.

537
00:19:54,149 --> 00:19:55,629
And now you're gonna
kiss their ass?

538
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:56,847
It's called the least we can do.

539
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:01,025
It's not right.
That's not right.

540
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:03,245
He should lock him up.Finally.

541
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:06,814
Uh, sir, I am -- I'm truly sorry
for the, uh, confusion.

542
00:20:06,857 --> 00:20:09,208
Confusion?
You just cuffed my grandbaby

543
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,253
and pointed guns
at my entire family.

544
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,950
And we're very sorry, ma'am.

545
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,257
Look, ma'am,
we were looking for a suspect

546
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,780
that fit the description
of your grandson.

547
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,739
Oh! Yeah. Young and Black.

548
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:20,915
We need to
speak to your Sergeant. Tim: Of course.

549
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,482
Ma'am, here's my business card

550
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,179
in case you want to
file a complaint.

551
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,398
You bet your ass we do.

552
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:30,838
Hey. It's a girl.

553
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:33,449
Mother and daughter
are doing just fine.

554
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:35,973
That's great. What happened with your mom?

555
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:39,281
Oh, it's just a hot mess,
which is normal.

556
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:40,891
Fiancé flew in to win her back.

557
00:20:40,935 --> 00:20:42,502
She'd already
hocked the engagement ring,

558
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:45,679
so he filed a police report,
with me, which I'll hear about.

559
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:47,898
I just wish I could say
this was new behavior,

560
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:50,118
but she's been pulling this
love-'em-and-leave-'em stuff

561
00:20:50,161 --> 00:20:52,251
since my dad split.

562
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:55,384
Well, not like I'm trying to
defend her or anything,

563
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:59,562
but a single mom raising a kid
alone in the '60s --

564
00:20:59,606 --> 00:21:01,303
'80s.

565
00:21:01,347 --> 00:21:03,610
Late '70s, early '80s.

566
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:05,220
Whatever.

567
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,092
Women couldn't even get their
own credit cards back then.

568
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:12,314
I mean, society was designed to
make them depend on men.

569
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:16,231
So maybe that made your mom
a little... mercenary.

570
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,366
Your old C.I. came through.

571
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:22,193
What did Felix tell you? That
my murder victim was recruited

572
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:24,195
to be local muscle
for a Guatemalan cartel,

573
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,328
specifically for La Fiera.

574
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:29,331
La Fiera? It's a woman?

575
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,898
Her real name's
Sandra de la Cruz.

576
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,074
She's a big-time drug runner
from Guatemala.

577
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:34,641
Legend goes that
when she was only 15,

578
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:36,207
she was walking home
from the hospital

579
00:21:36,251 --> 00:21:38,340
with her newborn son
when she got caught

580
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,908
in the crossfire
between two rival gangs.

581
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:43,563
To protect her baby,
she picks up a semiautomatic

582
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:46,174
off a dead narco
and kills everyone.

583
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:49,177
The cartel was so impressed,
they recruited her

584
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,919
and named her La Fiera.
And you believe that?

585
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:54,878
There's songs written about it
and a kick-ass telenovela.

586
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:57,272
So, whether her origin story
is true or not,

587
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,536
La Fiera is very real
and very dangerous.

588
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,973
And you think she's connected
to your homicide?

589
00:22:03,017 --> 00:22:05,933
I don't know.

590
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,282
What are these?

591
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:10,851
You're putting in your papers?

592
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:12,069
When?

593
00:22:12,113 --> 00:22:14,028
I don't know.

594
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:16,465
Were you gonna say something?

595
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:19,990
Like you share all
your personal decisions?

596
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:21,165
Eventually.

597
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:22,863
Exactly.

598
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,734
I'll tell everyone
when I'm ready.

599
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:25,996
Yes, sir.

600
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,998
I'm happy for you.

601
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:31,132
I just...

602
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:32,568
It won't be
the same without you.

603
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:37,530
Well, I'm either going to the
range or home to my mother.

604
00:22:37,573 --> 00:22:39,358
So, you're going to the range?

605
00:22:39,401 --> 00:22:41,011
100%. Maybe even a late dinner?

606
00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:43,666
You know, you could always
ask her to get a hotel.

607
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,059
You know, you'd think
that'd be the case.

608
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:46,582
You broke the first rule
of being a cop --

609
00:22:46,626 --> 00:22:48,410
have your fellow officer's back.

610
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:50,717
I did.
You questioned
every move I made,

611
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,719
all before the suspects
were even in cuffs.

612
00:22:52,762 --> 00:22:55,156
But what really pissed me off --
calling for a supervisor.

613
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:57,463
The whole city hears that and
thinks we're in over our heads.

614
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:58,464
We were in over our heads!

615
00:22:58,507 --> 00:23:00,335
No, you were!

616
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,381
Don't let it happen again.

617
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:06,559
Hey. Was he actually giving you
a hard time

618
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,343
about today? Yeah, it's whatever.

619
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,692
I just have to hold it down
for a few more weeks

620
00:23:09,736 --> 00:23:11,564
then I'll be free of him. What happened?

621
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:14,044
He jacked up the wrong suspect,
then threatened the family.

622
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:17,178
A Black family,
and it's not the first time.

623
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,441
You should tell Grey. Or at least
talk to Tim about it.

624
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:21,095
I did already.

625
00:23:21,138 --> 00:23:23,358
Tim said that he heard Doug
was "a solid cop,"

626
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,447
and that I should,
"learn what's useful from him

627
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:26,579
and ignore the rest."

628
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:29,233
He said that? Yeah.

629
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:31,975
And, look,
as horrible as today was,

630
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:34,369
technically,
Stanton didn't break any laws.

631
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,024
Plus, he's an 11-year vet
and I'm just a rookie.

632
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,504
No one's gonna listen to me.

633
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:40,375
We're listening.

634
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,508
And we're here if you ever want
to talk about it.

635
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,467

No, not yet.
I did get a look at him, though.

silicone-covered,
armor-piercing.

Same as my homicide.

655

in a white sedan,

659

It's a rental out of Pico-Union.
You get a name?

660
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,157
Yes, they e-mailed us
a copy of his driver's license.

how a cop with a good reputation
could do this.

681
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:03,257
Then I did a little research.

682
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,433
You survived
the Massacre of Antiguo Leon.

the scuba gear.

694

You needed to practice shooting

Clearly, that was Plan "A."

at a gun range,

704
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,361

an official letter of reprimand

715
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:28,821
and extended in the FTO program?

716
00:27:28,864 --> 00:27:30,692
Because I ignored
an LAPD regulation.

717

718

00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:38,613
Yes.

00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,963
And yet you want
special treatment.

the law, they are punished.

If those rules apply to them,

724
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:48,710
then they absolutely
apply to us, as well.
