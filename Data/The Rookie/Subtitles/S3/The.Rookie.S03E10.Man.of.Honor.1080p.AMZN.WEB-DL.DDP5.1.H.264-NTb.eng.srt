1
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:03,786
Alright, you guys!
- Whoo!

2
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:04,874
You just finished your first day
of Police Academy.

3
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:06,049
How do you feel?

4
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:08,138
Uh, like it might've been
a bad idea.

5
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:10,271
Look, I personally don't mind
doing it again tomorrow.

6
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:11,402
How about you?
Still feel like puking?

7
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:12,925
Uh, no. I did that
when you were taking

8
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:14,318
your extra lap, so now,

9
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:16,451
I just feel
a sense of achievement

10
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:19,149
and an even greater sense
that sticking, uh, close

11
00:00:19,193 --> 00:00:20,759
to you two is what's gonna
get me across the finish line.

12
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:21,847
Well, how about this --

13
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:22,805
we will all get through
together.

14
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:24,589
All for one, one for all.

15
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:25,895
Oh! Pinkies!

16
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,421
Hey, well, I personally
want to celebrate

17
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:32,119
by doing another lap.

18
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:33,685
That guy serious? Mm-hmm.

19
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:34,425
- Okay, ready?
- Yep.

20
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,427
Go for it.

21
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:37,733
What? D-Did you say go?

22
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:38,777
Three, two, one, go. Wait --

23
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:39,865
Oh, wait.

24
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,345
Oh, my God.

25
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:42,999
No one's saying I got my lights
punched out, but --

26
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,045
Whoo!...I'm just saying...

27
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:48,091
maybe think twice before you
take on Recruit Chen.

28
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,266
Do it! Go!

29
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,920
Go! Make it!

30
00:00:50,963 --> 00:00:52,878
I'm on your side!

31
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:54,097
Boom. Oh!

32
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:55,794
Ohh! No!

33
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,970
Your flashlight's not on!
Your flashlight is not on!

34
00:00:58,014 --> 00:00:59,276
The winner. The loser.

35
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,277
His flashlight wasn't on.

36
00:01:00,321 --> 00:01:01,104
We can do it again.

37
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:02,975
A-ha. What?

38
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:04,238
Calm down.

39
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,413
Okay, first of all,
just hold the mitts up.

40
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:06,153
Geez.

41
00:01:06,196 --> 00:01:08,024
Alright.

42
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:08,938
Disassemble. Ready?

43
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:10,505
Three, two, one, go.

44
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:15,075
Once I catch my breath,
I'm gonna come back in,

45
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:17,773
and it's gonna be round two.

46
00:01:17,816 --> 00:01:19,427
I'm -- I'm gonna take
a shot at the title.

47
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,776
And I'm arranging it nice, too.

48
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:22,212
Oh. Oh!

49
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,127
Another winner! Fudge!

50
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:25,955
How does it feel to be
so defeated?

51
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:27,174
I...

52
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:28,610
Man, I gotta practice.

53
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:29,437
Stop it. Yeah.

54
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,481
Someone gotta practice.

55
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:31,743
Ooh! Cut. Cut.

56
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:32,657
Okay.

57
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:34,529
Alright, you guys, we ready?

58
00:01:34,572 --> 00:01:35,747
What?

59
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:38,054
First time in uniform.

60
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,882
Everything except the badge.

61
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:41,362
So, tell me, uh,

62
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:44,626
why do you want to be
a police officer, Recruit Chen?

63
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:46,497
Oh, good question,
Recruit Nolan.

64
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,933
- That's me.
- Um...

65
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:51,067
I guess I want to do
something that matters.

66
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,373
Aw. That was a cute answer,

67
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,722
but everyone will say that.

68
00:01:53,765 --> 00:01:56,768
So, can you do me a favor
and dig deeper, please?

69
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:59,031
Okay.

70
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:02,818
Um, I guess -- I guess
I've been adrift since college,

71
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:05,647
trying on different hats
and different personalities,

72
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,650
and nothing's felt right,
until -- until this.

73
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:09,781
But I don't think the time spent

74
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:11,566
trying to find myself
was wasted.

75
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:13,176
You know,
everything I've done so far,

76
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,613
the profound and the foolish,

77
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:18,834
has prepared me to become
a police officer

78
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:23,186
so that I can protect
those who need it the most

79
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,275
and from those
who would do them harm.

80
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,322
Uh, that's... unexpected
and actually amazing.

81
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,497
That was really well said.

82
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,367
Thank you. That was -

83
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:31,673
I hope they don't ask me.

84
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:34,763
Now, make no mistake --
you will be tested.

85
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:37,331
You will see things no one
should have to see,

86
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:39,724
do things a person
should never be asked to do.

87
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:43,554
But what will get you
through it all is character.

88
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:45,730
When faced with
the worst of humanity,

89
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:48,994
you will need to be your best.

90
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,868
Aww, I love that.

91
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:54,957
Especially the Captain's speech.

92
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,001
I miss her.

93
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,481
Yeah, me, too.

94
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,222
She would be so proud
of you two.

95
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,832
Of all of us.

96
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:04,096
Look, just 30 more days and
you'll be a P2, too.

97
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,794
Also? As well?

98
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,230
Okay, until then,

99
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:09,232
don't speak to us
when we're on duty.

100
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:10,494
Whoa.

101
00:03:10,538 --> 00:03:11,147
Seriously, we can't be
caught dead socializing

102
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,583
with a lowly P1.

103
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:15,107
Somehow, I always knew this
about you two.

104
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,807
Ben! Guys, it's Ben!

105
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,895
Hey! Hi!

106
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:21,375
Oh! Ben!

107
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,941
Oh, congratulations, buddy.

108
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,813
Oh, come, come.
Come in, come in, come in.

109
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:26,075
God, where have you been?

110
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,207
Where haven't I been?

111
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,469
I mean, other than here.

112
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:30,079
I spent six months traveling
the world,

113
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:31,472
meeting fascinating people.

114
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:33,604
And by fascinating people,
you mean attractive women?

115
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:34,997
Who you dated?

116
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,391
No, not this time,
Officer Chen and Officer West.

117
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:38,914
And congrats to you two,
by the way.

118
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:42,047
No, I started my own global
charitable foundation.

119
00:03:42,091 --> 00:03:43,788
- Wow.
- But even saving the world

120
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:45,747
couldn't keep me from
coming home and celebrating

121
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,880
my best friend
becoming a glorious P2,

122
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:49,707
whatever that is.

123
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,231
Anyway, way to go, buddy.

124
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:52,362
Uh, stop. Actually, I haven't,

125
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,234
um, moved on.

126
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,278
Uh, since you've been gone,

127
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:57,976
there's been a little...
shifting.

128
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,413
Wait, so you three
are still rookies?

129
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:00,892
Oh, not those two.
They're good. Just me.

130
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:03,721
Um, I, uh, have
a 30-day extension

131
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:05,245
for breaking the rules.

132
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,681
Well, in my business,

133
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:08,204
breaking the rules is how you
make your first million.

134
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,598
Uh, if only.
But, I-I-I'm flattered.

135
00:04:10,641 --> 00:04:12,121
I'm so glad you're here.
It's so great to see you.

136
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,427
I just feel terrible that

137
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,906
you came all the way to
L.A. for me.

138
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,125
Oh, relax.

139
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:17,300
You know the foundation is
centered here.

140
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:18,432
I got plenty of work to do,

141
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:19,911
including getting Henry
squared away.

142
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,173
For what?

143
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:22,697
His -- His new gig.

144
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,438
I-I-I thought he told you.

145
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:26,527
No, and he's already got a gig

146
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,833
called being
a college student, so...

147
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:31,227
Well, you know what?

148
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,012
You should probably, uh,
talk to him about that.

149
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:35,579
Now, until then,

150
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,233
I don't think there's any point
in letting this go to waste.

151
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,974
Whoa!

152
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:40,018
Congratulations, pal.

153
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,852
There's got to be
a ceremony or something

154
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,506
to mark the rite of passage
into P2, right?

155
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,638
When my dad moved up,

156
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:51,726
he said the Watch Commander called him

157
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:52,901
to the front of roll call and gave him

158
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:54,598
a bottle of 30-year-old scotch.

159
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:57,645
Ah. I'm not really
a whiskey girl.

160
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,342
Oh, God, I hope
Sgt. Grey hasn't heard

161
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:00,343
the stories about
me and tequila.

162
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:01,692
Honestly, I hope they give us

163
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:03,215
something besides alcohol.

164
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:05,087
Wait, they're gonna give us
separate things, right?

165
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,263
'Cause I --Okay, just slow down, okay?

166
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,483
Don't ruin it by overthinking
everything, okay?

167
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:11,659
Just relax. Go with the flow.

168
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:13,356
Right. Go with the flow.

169
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,575
Mm-hmm. Because we are P2s now.

170
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:15,793
Hey.

171
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:18,361
Ooh.

172
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:22,104
And we get to sit with
the cool kids.

173
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,975
Oh, hell no. Keep moving.

174
00:05:24,019 --> 00:05:26,021
Okay.

175
00:05:26,064 --> 00:05:27,457
Man, that hurt in high school,

176
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,719
and it still hurts now. Yeah.

177
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,330
Well, we can't sit in
the front row,

178
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,722
'cause the front row's
for rookies.

179
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,594
So... boom.

180
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:34,464
Second row, baby.

181
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:36,988
That's right. What-what.

182
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:39,469
Hey, nice.

183
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:41,166
Hey.

184
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,951
<i>Hey, sorry I missed your call.</i>

185
00:05:42,994 --> 00:05:44,126
Oh, no problem. Um...

186
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:45,606
<i>Why are we whispering?</i>

187
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,085
Uh, I'm in Roll Call right now,
but don't worry.

188
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:49,653
- I think I have a second.
- So, uh, tell me what's going on.

189
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:51,873
Ben said he gave you a job,
but he wouldn't give me any details.

190
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,006
<i>Yeah. Uh, I've been meaning to
talk to you about that.</i>

191
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,139
Is it like a summer internship
or something?

192
00:05:57,182 --> 00:05:58,445
<i>No, it's a full-time job.</i>

193
00:05:58,488 --> 00:05:59,924
<i>I, uh, start next week.</i>

194
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,448
How are you gonna manage that
with college?

195
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:02,971
<i>I'm not. I'm dropping out.</i>

196
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:04,015
You're dropping out?

197
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,408
Officer Nolan,
you better be taking

198
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:07,410
a 911 overflow call
from Dispatch.

199
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:08,585
Y-Y-- Uh, yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

200
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:10,195
Uh, Henry, we'll talk
about this later.

201
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:12,720
Do you want to add another week
to your 30-day extension?

202
00:06:12,763 --> 00:06:14,286
You're already
the oldest rookie.

203
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,853
Wanna become
the longest-serving one?

204
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:17,072
No, sir. It won't happen again.

205
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:19,379
Good. Now, to the business
of the day.

206
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:22,947
Officer Chen, Officer West,
you'll --

207
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,993
Where the hell are y'all going?

208
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:27,430
Oh. Uh, sir,
we thought that maybe --

209
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:29,563
Sir, it's our first day as P2s.

210
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:31,260
So, what? You want me to
throw you a party, huh?

211
00:06:31,303 --> 00:06:32,087
Give you a gift?

212
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,523
Give you flowers? What?

213
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:37,222
What is the reward
for moving up, Office Chen?

214
00:06:37,266 --> 00:06:39,877
Getting to do the job another day, sir?

215
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,488
Are you asking me or
are you telling me?

216
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:43,185
Doing the job, sir.
That's right.

217
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,230
And today, you'll be
riding together.

218
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:47,450
I don't usually pair new P2s,

219
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:48,973
but I thought you two
could handle it.

220
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:50,192
Don't make me regret it.

221
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:51,193
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

222
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:52,194
Sit down.

223
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:53,848
Moving on.

224
00:06:53,891 --> 00:06:56,677
All PAS devices need
software updates.

225
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,113
Be sure to swap out
your old ones ...m guessing your dad lied.

226
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,244
Yeah, no kidding.

227
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,289
...before your shift.

228
00:07:02,073 --> 00:07:03,988
Hey. Henry. Me again.

229
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:06,382
Uh, call me, buddy.
We need to talk.

230
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,470
Okay. Talk to you soon.

231
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,907
I can't believe he's doing this.

232
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,648
I ju-- He loves school.

233
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:12,910
He tells me that all the time.

234
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:13,998
And he knows how I feel

235
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:15,391
about having to drop out at his age.

236
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,046
Go easy on him.
I-It could be a great job.

237
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,613
How would you feel

238
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:21,353
if Lila dropped out
of second grade?

239
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:24,618
Oh, my baby girl would never
disappoint me like that.

240
00:07:24,661 --> 00:07:27,011
Hey, do you have
any camping gear?

241
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:29,840
Yeah. Enough to take a two-week excursion

242
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:32,321
down the Amazon. Why?

243
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,454
I'm chaperoning
an overnight camping trip

244
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:35,977
for Lila's Girl Scout troop.

245
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,152
Wait, you don't like camping?

246
00:07:37,195 --> 00:07:39,110
No one does.
But I have bigger problems.

247
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:41,025
Alonzo is gonna be there.

248
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,418
The music class guy.
What's the problem?

249
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,506
I thought the two of you hit it off.

250
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,769
We did. And he asked me out.

251
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:48,555
But I had to cancel,
and then we re-scheduled,

252
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:51,645
but then he cancelled
at the last minute.

253
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:54,038
- And you think it was a revenge cancel?
- Feels like it.

254
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,736
But the bottom line is
I need to look good

255
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,955
the next time I see him,
and that is not gonna happen

256
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:01,176
if I am covered in bug spray
trying to set up a tent.

257
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:02,743
So, do you want to borrow the
camping equipment or not?

258
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:05,615
Yes.

259
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,059
Another congratulations text?

260
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:17,714
Uh, from my cousin. Cop family.

261
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:21,152
They're all taking me to dinner
at Pacific Dining Car

262
00:08:21,196 --> 00:08:22,458
for baseball steaks tonight.

263
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,286
Hmm. Family tradition.

264
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,288
Wanna come? My treat.

265
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:29,291
Oh. Thanks. Um... actually,

266
00:08:29,334 --> 00:08:31,032
my parents are coming over
for dinner tonight.

267
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:32,990
I think they're coming around
to me being a cop.

268
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:34,209
Uh, that's great.

269
00:08:34,252 --> 00:08:36,037
Yeah.

270
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,214
I'm hot. I'm sorry.
Are you not hot?

271
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:41,042
Yeah, but we can't
turn on the A/C

272
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:42,304
until after lunch, so...

273
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:44,524
Why not?

274
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:45,742
Oh, my gosh, you're right.

275
00:08:45,786 --> 00:08:47,875
That's a Tim rule,
and he's not here.

276
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,791
It's just us...
and we call the shots.

277
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:52,314
- Ha.
- Ooh!

278
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:53,663
Ooh!

279
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:56,405
The sweet, sweet chill
of independence.

280
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,146
Ooh. You know
something Lopez never let me do?

281
00:08:58,189 --> 00:08:59,669
Hmm?

282
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,498
Yes!

283
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,152
Bumping that bass
of freedom, baby.

284
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:05,588
Okay.

285
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,547
Ooh, ooh.

286
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:11,855
Get up, Boot!
"Quit" is a four-letter word.

287
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:14,597
Do you hear me?
Failure is not an option.

288
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:17,513
Oh, come on, man.

289
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,601
We're almost home.

290
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:26,261
Who wants a steak? Huh?

291
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,828
Come.

292
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,615
Can I help you?

293
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:33,877
Is Angela Lopez here?

294
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,531
In the changing suite.

295
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,577
She's gone through half
of our tissue supply.

296
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:40,144
Thanks.

297
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,193
You okay? What happened?

298
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:46,847
This.

299
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,023
- You're going into labor?
- No, the baby's fine.

300
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:50,633
I just -- Oh, I never imagined

301
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:52,026
I'd have to pick a wedding dress

302
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:53,593
based on its ability
to hide my belly.

303
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:55,116
Who said you have to
hide your belly?

304
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,900
My bridesmaids.

305
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,903
They said this is the one
that camouflages it best.

306
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,644
So, I kicked them all out
and texted you.

307
00:10:01,688 --> 00:10:04,299
You text me "911" on my day off

308
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:05,692
to ask me if a dress
makes you look fat?

309
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,128
Does it? Yes.

310
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,738
Because you're pregnant.

311
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,827
Are you ashamed of
your baby?
Of course not.

312
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:12,699
Okay, then who cares what
your stupid friends think?

313
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:14,439
Show off that baby belly.

314
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,398
Wear what you feel confident in.

315
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:18,574
Hell, wear a white half-tee

316
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,967
and let your gut hang out
like my Uncle Elliot

317
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,011
at my niece's christening.

318
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,056
He didn't.

319
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,884
Oh, yeah. He even managed to get

320
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:26,016
his gut in
the holy water somehow.

321
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,324
Anyway, what does your dream
wedding dress look like?

322
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,631
A V-neck dress with
bell sleeves.

323
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:34,503
Okay. So, we'll start there.

324
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:37,462
I'll go talk to the lady and
have her pull a few choices.

325
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,290
Okay.

326
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,646
It's our first call as P2s.

327
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:48,909
There you are.

328
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,693
We got a triple homicide on
the second floor.

329
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,434
Sir, what do you need
us to do? Canvass the area?

330
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:53,914
Track down potential witnesses?

331
00:10:53,957 --> 00:10:55,872
No, I got a special job
for you two.

332
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,700
Guarding evidence. Follow me.

333
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:01,965
This is the evidence?

334
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,532
Our suspect may have
helped himself

335
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:04,968
to some snacks
before taking off.

336
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:06,883
We think this chocolate bar
might be one of them.

337
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:08,189
TID's stuck in traffic.

338
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:09,799
Just keep it safe
'til they get here, Boots.

339
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:12,193
Uh, with all due respect, sir,
we're no longer Boots.

340
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:14,412
We're P2s. Don't let it melt.

341
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:22,377
<i>7-Adam-15, silent
alarm, manually activated,</i>

342
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,118
<i>2-11 type at
Copley Bank & Trust,</i>

343
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:25,728
<i>28700 Wilshire.</i>

344
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:27,295
Control, we're on site
at that possible 2-11.

345
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:28,731
Hold for confirmation.

346
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:35,695
Control, we have a confirmed
2-11 in progress.

347
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,609
Send additional units
and airship.

348
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,524
Have them shut down about
a block before they get here.

349
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,265
Send a supervisor.

350
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,484
Harper, I think
I can get in close.

351
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:44,965
Do it. I'll post up here.

352
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:47,619
Stay behind cover.
Let me know what you see.

353
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:49,491
Don't make a move
until I tell you.

354
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,899
Come on, come on,
come on, move it!

355
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:08,423
Put the money in the bag!
Fill it up! Faster! Come on!

356
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:12,122
Control, suspect is male,
six-foot, black leather jacket,

357
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,081
beige shirt, blue jeans,
wearing a mask,

358
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:14,995
armed with a handgun.

359
00:12:15,038 --> 00:12:16,736
I'm counting seven hostages,

360
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,825
including two tellers
and a guard.

361
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,176
Come on!

362
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,267
Move! Move!
Keeps your hands up high!

363
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,529
Do not fire. Two coming out.

364
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:28,399
We got two hostages coming out.

365
00:12:36,886 --> 00:12:38,279
Police! Drop that gun!

366
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,672
Leave or I'll shoot her!

367
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,326
No. No, you won't!
You're not gonna do that.

368
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,371
We're gonna work this out
right now.

369
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:44,851
No, we can't!

370
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:47,201
But you gotta let me leave
with this bag or she dies!

371
00:12:47,244 --> 00:12:49,159
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

372
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,465
Okay, look, clearly,
everything's gotten

373
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:52,728
out of control, so, uh,
I find it's best

374
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,556
in these situations to just
slow everything down,

375
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,819
so let's start with
an introduction.

376
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:59,474
I'm John Nolan.
What's your name?

377
00:12:59,517 --> 00:13:01,998
Yeah. You're on camera
right now.

378
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:05,915
They are comparing your face to
DMV records as we speak.

379
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:06,742
It's Cooper.

380
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,004
Cooper. Okay, good.

381
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,746
Cooper, first thing
we need to deal with

382
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,314
is the young woman you're
terrorizing with that gun.

383
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:14,706
Look, I let her go
and you kill me.

384
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,491
No. No, not true.

385
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:18,667
Right now, you have cover
and concealment.

386
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,103
So long as you stay behind
that pillar,

387
00:13:20,147 --> 00:13:21,801
you're gonna be fine.

388
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:26,370
Cooper, funny story -- this is
not my first bank robbery.

389
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:29,112
First one was before
I was a cop, and that day,

390
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:31,201
I had a whole bunch of
problems on my mind,

391
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,421
but as soon as
the guns came out,

392
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:36,076
I only cared about one thing,
and that was making sure

393
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:39,340
everybody got out of there
alive, and I think, deep down,

394
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,342
you want the same thing, Cooper.

395
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,914
Look, I don't want to
hurt anyone.

396
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:48,871
But I don't have a choice, okay?

397
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,699
My family -- I understand.

398
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:53,180
I know your family would want
you to survive this, too.

399
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:56,357
So... let the girl go.

400
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:01,536
Look, if I do, you gotta
let me walk out of here.

401
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:03,190
Cooper, there's another dozen
officers outside

402
00:14:03,233 --> 00:14:04,234
and more on the way.

403
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,889
Look, none of this
was supposed to happen.

404
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:09,457
I know. Yet here we are.

405
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,764
Look, you just let her go,

406
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:16,333
put the gun down,
and it'll all be over.

407
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:21,904
Go.

408
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:22,949
Good. Good, good, good, good.

409
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,080
We're almost home.

410
00:14:24,124 --> 00:14:25,908
Now you just gotta
put that gun down.

411
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,692
Nice and easy.

412
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,434
Great. Right there.

413
00:14:30,478 --> 00:14:32,872
Just put your gun down
right there.

414
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,395
No, don't!

415
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:35,091
Drop it! Drop your gun!

416
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:36,484
Drop it!

417
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:37,964
He had a gun!

418
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:38,921
He was gonna shoot us!

419
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,096
He was giving up!

420
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,358
One Code 4 in the bank.

421
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:42,620
Suspect is down.
Gunshot wound to the chest.

422
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,274
Unconscious, not breathing.

423
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,802
You okay?

424
00:14:50,846 --> 00:14:52,021
His gun was empty.

425
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,119
To the left.
No, no. Too much, too much.

426
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:04,338
Back to the right.

427
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:06,079
Just a hair to your left.

428
00:15:06,122 --> 00:15:07,732
Come on, it's turning into
chocolate sauce.

429
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,343
Yeah, look, we can't have
our first day

430
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:11,040
as full-fledged cops
end in failure

431
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:12,999
because we could not preserve
crucial evidence.

432
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,565
Well, unless you can get the sun

433
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:17,177
to crank the temperature down,
we're screwed.

434
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,352
What the hell are you doing?

435
00:15:18,395 --> 00:15:20,310
Oh, sir, uh, these are
the cooling aids

436
00:15:20,354 --> 00:15:21,964
to help protect the evidence.

437
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,445
I like the dedication,
but we just found our suspect

438
00:15:24,488 --> 00:15:26,621
walking down La Brea,
covered in the victims' blood.

439
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:28,101
He immediately confessed.

440
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,929
Wait, so, this is just...

441
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,018
Garbage.

442
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:35,369
Uh, do the city a favor and
clean it up before you go.

443
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,240
<i>7-Adam-07,</i>

444
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:39,547
<i>disturbance at 25616 Wilshire.</i>

445
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,809
<i>Are you free to respond?</i>

446
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:42,593
Control, that's an affirmative.

447
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:43,725
Show us responding.

448
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:46,423
Alright. Let's just, uh,
shake this off

449
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:48,948
and rock the rest of the day.

450
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:51,994
Can you grab the chocolate?

451
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,476
Ew. Oh, my -- Ugh.

452
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,609
You doing okay in there?

453
00:15:58,653 --> 00:15:59,828
You ever tried zipping up
a dress

454
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:01,482
with a bowling ball
on your belly?

455
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:04,093
It takes time,
so quit rushing me.

456
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:06,095
I am not rushing you.

457
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,836
I'm prepared to stay here

458
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,447
until you've tried on
every single dress.

459
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,931
Whoa.

460
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,064
Really? Oh, yeah.

461
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:21,067
I know. It's perfect.

462
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:25,767
Thank you so much
for doing this with me.

463
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,855
Of course.

464
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:33,122
Get your claws off my dress!

465
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,297
"My dress?!"

466
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:35,951
You put it back on the rack!

467
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,431
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.

468
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:38,606
The police are on their way.

469
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:39,824
Let go now!

470
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:40,738
Oh, we're not getting involved

471
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:42,175
unless someone loses a limb.

472
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,655
Though I should probably
film it for evidence.

473
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:47,049
Police.

474
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,573
Lopez? What are you doing here?

475
00:16:49,617 --> 00:16:51,140
I'll give you three guesses.

476
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:52,576
Are you helping her find
a wedding dress?

477
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,795
Well, right now,
I'm watching you

478
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,057
not do your job.

479
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:56,841
Look, ladies, you just need to
settle down.

480
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:58,495
Ma'am, you gotta let go of
the dress right now, okay?

481
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:01,542
They grow up so fast,
don't they?

482
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:03,283
...my dress!

483
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,067
I'm not leaving without
this dress!

484
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,851
Aah!

485
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,812
Stay there.

486
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:12,596
Ooh, looking good, Officer Chen.

487
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,337
Looking good.

488
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:15,425
♪ If you don't think...

489
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:22,432
It always feels
a little callous to me --

490
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:24,782
using a death notification
to question a loved one.

491
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:27,220
It's actually when people tend
to be the most forthcoming.

492
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:28,656
And for all we know,
Cooper's wife

493
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,136
was supposed to be
the getaway driver.

494
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:31,485
Well, the car's here.

495
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:33,487
Man, a house like this.
Why rob a bank?

496
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,010
Why not just take out
a second mortgage?

497
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,665
Maybe he did and he just needed
the cash right away.

498
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,319
For what? Property taxes?

499
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:41,756
I'm serious.
This whole case is weird.

500
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,411
Cooper said he didn't have
a choice.

501
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:45,716
What's that supposed to mean?

502
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,283
Looks can be deceiving.

503
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:48,937
I mean, people in this town

504
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,200
drive around
in cars they can't afford,

505
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,593
flaunting wealth
that they don't have.

506
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:54,290
Maybe Cooper was just
one of those people

507
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,770
and he got desperate.

508
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:56,597
What's the wife's name?

509
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,467
Alice Hicks.

510
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:02,994
You hear that?

511
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,083
Yeah.

512
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,957
Open the door, please.

513
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:12,874
Control, 7-Adam-15.

514
00:18:12,917 --> 00:18:14,223
No one is coming to the door.

515
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:17,574
We are making entry to
welfare check Cooper's wife.

516
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,015
Police! Anyone home?

517
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:51,565
House is clear.

518
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:53,480
Ice cream's been left out
awhile.

519
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:55,395
That phone alarm's been
going off since 7:00 a.m.

520
00:18:55,438 --> 00:18:57,179
Any sign of the wife or
daughter?
Nothing.

521
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:58,789
They might have gone voluntarily

522
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,835
and left the phone behind
to avoid being tracked.

523
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:02,967
Or they got caught up in
whatever Cooper was doing,

524
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:03,881
and they're in danger.

525
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:06,623
Control, notify detectives.

526
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:09,409
Our bank robber's wife
and daughter are missing.

527
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:11,150
This is a possible crime scene.

528
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,548
Thanks. We'll take it from here.

529
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:20,811
Hey. Any updates?

530
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:22,552
Uh, just that Alice
sent an e-mail

531
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:23,988
to her daughter's school
this morning

532
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,294
excusing her from class.

533
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,774
Well, we need to know when
that e-mail was sent,

534
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:28,602
because if it went before
the phone alarm went off --

535
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:31,561
Nolan, I need you
to take a breath.

536
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:32,997
Okay, I know this case has
gotten under your skin,

537
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,434
but we've done our jobs.

538
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,566
It's the detectives' case
now, okay?

539
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,046
We are end of shift.

540
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:40,614
It just feels weird going home
not knowing what happened.

541
00:19:40,657 --> 00:19:43,312
I know. I get it, but trust me,

542
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,227
being able to clock out
at the end of shift,

543
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,794
it is a gift.

544
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:49,013
Caradine, he will --
he will work this case hard,

545
00:19:49,057 --> 00:19:50,624
and we get to go home.

546
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,278
Uh, more accurately,
you get to go to my house

547
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,888
- to pick up the camping gear.
- Mm.

548
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:55,498
So that you can spend
the night in the great outdoors

549
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:57,065
with a bunch of second graders.

550
00:19:57,108 --> 00:19:59,110
And a man who may
or may not hate you

551
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:01,243
'cause you blew him off.

552
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,810
You know, I feel like you
enjoyed saying that

553
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:04,028
- just a little too much.
- Did I smile?

554
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:04,855
I was trying not to smile.

555
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,292
I saw it. Sorry. Guilty.

556
00:20:09,686 --> 00:20:12,428
Ooh. Someone looks handsome.

557
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:14,038
Thank you. Figured I better be
photo-ready

558
00:20:14,082 --> 00:20:15,214
in case this makes
the Christmas card.

559
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:16,911
Yeah. What you, uh...

560
00:20:16,954 --> 00:20:18,129
cooking for
your own celebration?

561
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:19,827
Yeah, it's a special occasion.

562
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,350
I'm making lotus root soup.

563
00:20:21,394 --> 00:20:22,612
It's my mom's favorite.

564
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,962
Okay. Mmm.

565
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:25,963
Oh, my gosh. It's perfect.

566
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,056
Jackson. Hi.

567
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,624
You still listening to that
mindfulness podcast I sent you?

568
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:35,669
Every day, Mrs. Chen.

569
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:36,539
Thanks for recommending it.

570
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:39,716
Oh, are you leaving?

571
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,501
Uh, Jackson's family is

572
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:42,806
taking him out to dinner
to celebrate.

573
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,547
Oh. How lovely.

574
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:46,114
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

575
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:47,115
Bye, guys. Bye-bye!

576
00:20:47,158 --> 00:20:49,335
Where's -- Where's Dad?

577
00:20:49,378 --> 00:20:51,162
Oh, he's got his book club
tonight.

578
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,078
Well, that's fine.

579
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:57,821
We can just have
a girls' night celebrating.

580
00:20:57,865 --> 00:21:00,955
Actually, I'm not here
to celebrate.

581
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:04,524
We need to talk about
this whole police officer thing.

582
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,352
What? Mom...

583
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:08,745
Look, you gave it a year,
proved you could do it.

584
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,356
Brava.

585
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,141
It's time for you to do
something meaningful

586
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:14,751
with your life. "Something meaningful"?

587
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:16,449
Yeah.

588
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,712
Go back to school.
Get your master's.

589
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,279
Have a profession.

590
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,718
Being a cop is my profession.

591
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,372
As a paid bully for the city?

592
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:27,851
Is that how you see me?

593
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,853
It's how a lot of people
see you.

594
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:32,726
Especially now.
I want to be proud of you,

595
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:35,206
instead of hoping people
don't ask me

596
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,425
what you do for a living.

597
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:39,080
Mom, can you just support me?

598
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:40,734
You know, you seem happy enough
for Jackson.

599
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:43,084
- I-I don't get it.
- Jackson is not my child.

600
00:21:43,127 --> 00:21:46,566
You are. Your father and I
have been very patient,

601
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,785
supporting you
as you quit grad school,

602
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:50,221
followed your passions,

603
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:55,183
but now, it is time to
get serious about your future.

604
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:57,490
Being a police officer
is my future.

605
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:59,970
I <i>love</i> this job. I love it.

606
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:01,668
I get to help people.

607
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:03,365
You want to help people?

608
00:22:03,409 --> 00:22:05,498
Become a doctor. Wow.

609
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,978
Sorry to be so blunt,
but it needed to be said.

610
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:09,197
Right. Lucy.

611
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,895
What?

612
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:14,158
Your father and I
will always love you.

613
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:16,247
Mm-hmm.
But you are risking
your life

614
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,642
for a thankless job,
and we cannot be supportive of

615
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,252
this any longer. Okay. Okay!

616
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,038
Okay. I heard you
the first time.

617
00:22:24,081 --> 00:22:25,866
If you're done expressing
your disappointment,

618
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:28,695
I would -- I would like
some space, please.

619
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:32,351
Can you just go?!

620
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:36,180
♪ ...this love to be at ease

621
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:46,626
Come on.

622
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:50,151
Hey. You need help with that?

623
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:52,588
Alonzo. Hi.

624
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:54,677
No. No, I'm fine. I got it.

625
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:57,114
Where are Lila
and the other girls?

626
00:22:57,158 --> 00:22:58,072
Moonlight hike.

627
00:22:58,115 --> 00:22:59,552
I fake-pulled a hamstring

628
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:00,988
so I could stay behind,
man the fort.

629
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:02,337
Maybe I should join them.

630
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,427
You wanna wander around
in the woods at night?

631
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:06,907
You're braver than me. Yeah.

632
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,561
Uh, you know what?
Maybe I will --

633
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:10,693
I will just make camp.

634
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,008
Okay, you know what?

635
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:24,751
I have no idea what I'm doing.

636
00:23:24,794 --> 00:23:26,448
Neither did I.

637
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:30,365
This is all my gear.

638
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,759
Look, I understand if
you changed your mind

639
00:23:32,802 --> 00:23:34,413
about wanting to go out with me.

640
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:36,632
I just don't want it
to be weird between us.

641
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:38,417
Wait. I didn't change my mind.

642
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,505
You changed your mind.

643
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:40,897
You cancelled on me.

644
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:43,378
Yeah, but then you
revenge cancelled on me.

645
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,424
No. That was a regular cancel.

646
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:49,558
And after that,
you cancelled on me again.

647
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:51,430
Oh, right.

648
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,563
Yeah, I-I was stuck
at a crime scene.

649
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,260
I was sure you hated me.

650
00:23:56,304 --> 00:24:00,439
No. No. I don't hate you at all.

651
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:03,833
Good. I don't hate you, either.

652
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:05,835
Good.

653
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:08,185
So, you still owe me
a date, though.

654
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:10,405
S'mores and a beer work?

655
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:14,148
Wow. Okay. Yeah. For now.

656
00:24:15,323 --> 00:24:17,238
But if this goes well,

657
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:21,460
I require someplace with
a wine list and indoor plumbing.

658
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,504
I can make that happen.

659
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:28,162
Drink fast. Drink fast.

660
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:37,214
You know,
if we're not there in 15,

661
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:38,651
they're gonna give away
our table.

662
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:41,175
Oh, I'm sure once the Maitre d'
sees that it's you,

663
00:24:41,218 --> 00:24:43,873
he'll just move us to
the front of the line.

664
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:47,311
Listen, look, I never would have
offered Henry a job

665
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:48,661
if I knew you'd be this upset.

666
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:50,663
Well, of course I'm upset, Ben.

667
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:52,708
He's throwing away
his education.

668
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:54,275
A college degree isn't
the silver bullet

669
00:24:54,318 --> 00:24:55,755
that it used to be. I mean...

670
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:58,409
this is a phenomenal job
for a kid his age.

671
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,673
He's gonna get to travel
the world, alright?

672
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,718
Make connections,
gain life experience.

673
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:03,893
Okay, how much is he gonna make?

674
00:25:03,937 --> 00:25:04,981
Low six figures.

675
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:07,636
That's... more than I make.

676
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,942
I don't want Henry
just thinking that

677
00:25:08,985 --> 00:25:10,421
things in life are just
gonna be handed to him.

678
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:12,423
Oh, like they were to me?

679
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,339
This is a real job, John,

680
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:17,211
and I didn't
just give it to him.

681
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:18,604
He had to come in and sell me

682
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,475
on why he was
the best candidate.

683
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,216
And like it or not,
that's the way the world works.

684
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,479
People are given opportunities
all the time

685
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,741
- because of who they know.
- I wasn't.

686
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,351
Well, you say the word,

687
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:29,702
and I'll set you up as head of
my security right now.

688
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:32,008
You'll be making triple
what you do in LAPD.

689
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:34,489
Trip--

690
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,708
No. Ben, it's -- it's --

691
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:37,753
it's not about the money.

692
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:39,538
No. It's about you.

693
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,235
I mean,
you dropped out of school

694
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:42,671
because Sarah got pregnant,

695
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:45,674
and there's a part of you
that resents it, right?

696
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:47,546
This is just opening up
old wounds.

697
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,635
You think I'm jealous of my kid

698
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,158
because he's succeeding
where I --

699
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,594
Failed?

700
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:58,731
Let's take a rain check
for dinner.

701
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:01,124
Um -- I don't -- I'm just --
I think I've lost my appetite.

702
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:09,524
This is stupid.

703
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,221
No matter what I pick,
Patrice will overrule me.

704
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:13,397
So don't let her.

705
00:26:13,441 --> 00:26:17,576
Look, my dad got drunk at
my wedding and made Isabel cry,

706
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,490
and then my uncle lost
his dentures

707
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:20,448
in the chocolate fountain.

708
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:22,319
Same uncle as the baby tee?

709
00:26:22,363 --> 00:26:24,626
Yeah, although he wore
a purple suit to the wedding.

710
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,629
Look, my point is,
there are a million things

711
00:26:27,673 --> 00:26:32,678
you can't control,
so pick what you want.

712
00:26:32,721 --> 00:26:34,854
I want tres leches.

713
00:26:34,897 --> 00:26:37,596
But Patrice will blow a gasket
if I pick an "ethnic" cake.

714
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,687
You know what? Screw Patrice.

715
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,645
Alright, if she's got
a problem with tres leches

716
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:47,780
or anything else for that
matter, she can answer to me.

717
00:26:47,823 --> 00:26:48,781
Really?

718
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,478
Hell yeah.

719
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,051
Tim Bradford --

720
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,879
What are you doing?
Sit back down.

721
00:26:59,922 --> 00:27:01,489
Will you be my Man of Honor?

722
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:03,665
Your what? That's not a thing.

723
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:05,798
Yes, it is.

724
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:07,451
You're the only person who's
made me feel like

725
00:27:07,495 --> 00:27:10,672
I can get through this wedding
without losing my mind.

726
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,501
Please? I need you.

727
00:27:15,546 --> 00:27:18,680
Fine. I will be
your Man of Honor.

728
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:21,161
Thank God.

729
00:27:21,204 --> 00:27:23,685
Your first official duty
is to fire

730
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:24,947
-my old Maid of Honor,
-Gretchen.
What?

731
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,478
Good morning! No. Don't.

732
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:37,917
- Don't what?
- Don't say words to me.

733
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,484
Beds were invented for a reason.

734
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:41,877
How awkward was it with Alonzo?

735
00:27:44,314 --> 00:27:46,229
Smiles? Do tell.

736
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:49,145
We are going on a date tonight.

737
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,712
So, until then, you and I
are gonna find

738
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:53,062
a nice, quiet spot
to spend our shift,

739
00:27:53,106 --> 00:27:55,804
preferably behind a coffee shop
with a clean bathroom.

740
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:57,588
No problem. Consider it done.

741
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:58,981
First, though, we should
probably stop

742
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:00,156
at the Diamond District.

743
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,332
Why would we do that?

744
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:04,813
Nolan. What did you do?

745
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,425
I came into work early
because I couldn't sleep.

746
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,601
I just kept thinking about
our bank robber's family --

747
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:12,081
his wife and daughter just
disappearing like that.

748
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:14,823
And I know we're supposed to
end the shift

749
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:16,433
and just move on,
but I couldn't.

750
00:28:16,477 --> 00:28:19,088
So, I spoke to
Sergeant Caradine --

751
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:20,437
I'm sorry. You did what?

752
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:22,004
And you were right.
Cooper and his wife

753
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:23,440
were beyond broke --

754
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:26,269
two mortgages, tens of thousands
in credit card debt.

755
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:29,229
Alice had recently took a job
at a jewelry store.

756
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:30,839
In the Diamond District.

757
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:32,449
Caradine said it would be okay
if we just dropped by there,

758
00:28:32,493 --> 00:28:34,538
talked to her boss, see if
she tried to contact him,

759
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:36,323
maybe asked for a loan.

760
00:28:36,366 --> 00:28:38,499
And good news --
right down the street,

761
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:40,501
they set up
the best coffee truck in town.

762
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:41,676
It's a win-win.

763
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:47,377
Is that a yes?

764
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:49,075
Hey. You were up and out early.

765
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:51,207
And you were home late.

766
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,035
- How was the celebration?
- Awesome.

767
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:56,125
Great food, good company,
and a few too many shots.

768
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:57,300
Mm.

769
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:58,824
Oh, check out
what my folks gave me.

770
00:28:58,867 --> 00:29:01,740
Saint Michael,
patron saint of cops.

771
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:05,178
Mm. Is it too late for
your parents to adopt me?

772
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:07,180
What? Trouble with the folks?

773
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:10,444
No. They're just not
as fun as yours.

774
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,794
You ready to go? Yes, ma'am.

775
00:29:12,838 --> 00:29:15,971
Day two on our own. Let's roll.

776
00:29:16,015 --> 00:29:17,364
Are you gonna say that
every day?

777
00:29:17,407 --> 00:29:18,974
What? "Let's roll"?
You don't like it?

778
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:21,281
Eh, you can do better.

779
00:29:21,324 --> 00:29:22,761
Hmm.

780
00:29:23,109 --> 00:29:24,501
Hey, hey,
I've been looking for you.

781
00:29:24,545 --> 00:29:25,894
So, listen, about last night --

782
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:27,417
Don't you dare back out on me.

783
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:29,680
Relax. I never go
back on my word.

784
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:31,334
Good. Because Gretchen
will be here any second.

785
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:33,206
And you don't think you should
be the one to fire her?

786
00:29:33,249 --> 00:29:34,555
I would, but I'm working a case

787
00:29:34,598 --> 00:29:36,209
and I gotta get to the morgue.

788
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,907
I'm here to see Angela Lopez.

789
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,257
Coward.

790
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,654
Gretchen?

791
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:47,916
Tim Bradford.

792
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,005
We met before at Angela's
niece's quinceañera.

793
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,398
Right. Hi.

794
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:53,443
Hey. So, Angela asked me
to meet with you.

795
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:54,662
Oh.

796
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:55,576
We were supposed to talk about
the strippers

797
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:57,230
for the bachelorette party.

798
00:29:57,273 --> 00:29:58,840
Do you have a connection
or something?

799
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:00,581
Or, hear me out,

800
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:02,713
you interested in making
a little extra cash?

801
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:04,628
What? No. No.

802
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:06,717
Look, I-I'm sorry to be the one
to have to tell you this --

803
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,981
Ugh. Ignore.

804
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:11,070
You were saying?

805
00:30:11,113 --> 00:30:13,115
You're fired.

806
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:14,725
It's not you, it's Lopez.

807
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:15,683
She's -- Wait.

808
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:17,859
Are you firing me from being

809
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:20,557
my best friend's Maid of Honor?

810
00:30:20,601 --> 00:30:24,300
Yes. She wants me to take over,
be her Man of Honor.

811
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:25,911
Thank God.

812
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:27,869
This whole thing's been
a nightmare.

813
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:31,655
These... are "Patrice's Picks."

814
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:33,919
Do not deviate from
the approved list of vendors

815
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:35,616
without Patrice's consent.

816
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,618
There's a little
anti-anxiety medication

817
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:39,446
in the front pocket --
you're gonna need it.

818
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:42,014
This is the Patrice phone.

819
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:44,233
She gave it to me so I can
always be on call.

820
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:45,626
There's about a half a dozen
messages

821
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:49,021
that I haven't had the strength
to listen to yet.

822
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:51,632
Good luck.

823
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,903
Alright. If you need me,
I'll be just down the block.

824
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:04,863
All I need is a quart of coffee
and a glazed donut.

825
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:31,454
Hey.</i> Hey, are you seeing this?</i>

826
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:33,935
<i>There's a van -- just pulled
up outside Alice's building.</i>

827
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:36,198
It says "Nonna Primo's Pizza"
on the side.

828
00:31:36,242 --> 00:31:37,983
That same van was parked outside
the bank yesterday.

829
00:31:38,026 --> 00:31:38,984
Yeah, I remember.

830
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:42,552
That cannot be a coincidence.

831
00:31:42,596 --> 00:31:44,467
What if Cooper was forced
to rob that bank?

832
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:46,643
Tell me if this tracks -- home
invasion right after dinner.

833
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,689
Cooper is getting his daughter
some ice cream,

834
00:31:48,732 --> 00:31:50,517
bad guys break in
looking for money.

835
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,041
Only despite the McMansion,
Cooper's beyond broke,

836
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:54,564
but the bad guys
have his wife and kid.

837
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:56,697
So he tells them he'll rob
a bank for them.

838
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,220
They hold the wife and kid
as collateral,

839
00:31:58,264 --> 00:32:00,396
and then they drive Cooper to
the bank in the pizza van.

840
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,441
To make sure he goes through
with it.

841
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:03,356
Only Cooper gets killed.

842
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,099
That's Alice.

843
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,578
Cooper couldn't make good
on the money.

844
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:10,624
They're gonna force her
to steal from her job.

845
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,017
You think the kid's in the van?

846
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,323
Possibly. I'll call Grey,
tell him what's going on

847
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:15,934
and have additional units
hold a perimeter.

848
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:17,718
Right.

849
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:27,641
No. Good.

850
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:30,209
Come to me. My name's John.

851
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:31,514
We know you're in trouble.

852
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:32,385
- We're here to help you.
- They have my daughter.

853
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:33,560
I know. Is she in the van?

854
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:34,996
No. They left her behind.

855
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,519
And if I don't walk out of here
in five minutes

856
00:32:36,563 --> 00:32:37,868
with a quarter million
in diamonds,

857
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:40,567
they're going to kill her.

858
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:46,007
Hey, what's up?

859
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:47,443
Hey, Lucy, I need you to
help me find

860
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:49,010
a little girl being
held hostage.

861
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:50,707
<i>The mother is here with me now.</i>

862
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:52,057
The men that took them
are forcing her

863
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,362
to steal from her employer.

864
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:54,798
She was blindfolded
on the drive here,

865
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:56,757
but she said the ride
to the Diamond District

866
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,367
- took about 15 minutes.
- Closer to 10, I think.

867
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,326
Well, that's still
a big search grid.

868
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:02,676
I-I-I know we took a freeway.
I could hear it.

869
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:04,634
Uh, what direction was
the sun coming from?

870
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:08,377
I felt the sun on my face,
so, um, ahead of us.

871
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:10,684
10 eastbound. We're en route.

872
00:33:10,727 --> 00:33:12,816
How long were you driving
before you got on the freeway?

873
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,775
<i>Not long. Maybe a minute.</i>

874
00:33:14,818 --> 00:33:17,256
So nine minutes on the
freeway, driving the speed limit.

875
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:18,561
'Cause they couldn't risk
being pulled over.

876
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,563
Right. So, at 65 miles per hour,

877
00:33:20,607 --> 00:33:22,565
going backwards from
Spring Street,

878
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:26,569
11:00 in the morning,
during moderate traffic.

879
00:33:26,613 --> 00:33:28,441
I'd say they got on at Crenshaw.

880
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,269
Can you remember
any other details?

881
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:31,792
Anything will help them
find her.

882
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:36,014
Potholes -- there were two
back to back

883
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,276
right after the first turn.

884
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,104
<i>Uh, they shook the car. The driver cursed.</i>

885
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:41,280
When you took your first turn,
was it a right or a left?

886
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:43,760
A right. Uh -- uh, no.

887
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:47,155
My body leaned right, so left.

888
00:33:52,856 --> 00:33:54,510
- It's them.
- Lucy, I need you to find

889
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:55,337
that little girl fast, alright?

890
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:56,730
We're on it. <i> Alright.</i>

891
00:33:56,773 --> 00:33:57,818
I need you to answer that.

892
00:33:57,861 --> 00:33:59,167
Everything is going to be okay.

893
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:00,386
Just be calm.

894
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:01,865
How? They're gonna kill my baby.

895
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:03,258
I can't be calm.

896
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:06,566
Then be angry.

897
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:07,523
What?

898
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,003
What's taking so long?

899
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,091
I had to go to the bathroom
and throw up

900
00:34:10,135 --> 00:34:11,701
because you terrified me.

901
00:34:11,745 --> 00:34:12,963
<i>Get it together.</i>

902
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:14,313
If you're not back here
in three minutes,

903
00:34:14,356 --> 00:34:15,966
I tell Charles to break
your daughter's neck.

904
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:19,231
They're not gonna find her
in three minutes.

905
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:20,710
What are we gonna do?

906
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:21,711
We'll get my partner to
stall them for us.

907
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:24,279
Hey, Harper, you wanna
have some fun?

908
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:43,342
There's a cop out here.

909
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:45,213
Stay inside until she's gone.

910
00:34:45,257 --> 00:34:46,867
Okay.

911
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,916
Okay. Thanks.

912
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,831
Dispatch put out an alert to all units.

913
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:57,138
We've got two candidates on
the twin potholes.

914
00:34:57,182 --> 00:35:01,621
Closest one is right up hereon Oakmont.

915
00:35:01,664 --> 00:35:03,579
- Right there.
- Two big-ass potholes.

916
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:04,885
Mom said they took a left
onto this road

917
00:35:04,928 --> 00:35:06,626
just before
they drove over them.

918
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:08,149
Which means we take
the next right.

919
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:09,542
Slow down.
This is a dead-end street.

920
00:35:09,585 --> 00:35:11,065
We don't want to spook them
by rolling in.

921
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,545
Let's pull over
and park somewhere.

922
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:15,678
7-Adam-07, Code 6
at Oakmont and Arbor.

923
00:35:23,643 --> 00:35:25,123
She could be in
any one of these houses.

924
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:26,472
Or none of them.

925
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:28,822
Let's think positive.

926
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:31,346
How do we find the right house
without spooking them?

927
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,306
Use what we learned about
criminal behavior.

928
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:44,490
Number one -- they're secretive.

929
00:35:44,533 --> 00:35:46,970
Look, all the curtains are down
on that gray house.

930
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:49,190
The first thing you'd do if you
were holding a hostage.

931
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:51,888
Number two --
they're often messy.

932
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:54,326
Number three -- they don't
spend their money wisely.

933
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:55,588
Control, run the plate

934
00:35:55,631 --> 00:36:00,680
2-David-David-Tom-4-5-6

00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:34,448
Henry's your son.
You want what's best for him.

1053
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,277
I just don't know how to
reconcile my desire

1054
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,322
for him to have a better life
than I did

1055
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:41,977
and wanting him to understand
the sacrifices I made

1056
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:44,284
to get him here.
Does that make sense?

1057
00:41:44,327 --> 00:41:46,373
It does.

1058
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:49,811
Hmm. He's a grown-up now.

1059
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:51,683
He's gonna make his own choices,

1060
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:54,555
even if I don't like
what those choices are.

1061
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,992
John, I'm gonna watch out
for him, okay?

1062
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:59,778
I know you will.

1063
00:41:59,821 --> 00:42:01,170
To college dropouts.

1064
00:42:01,214 --> 00:42:02,824
Actually, I went back to school
to get my degree.

1065
00:42:02,868 --> 00:42:04,347
Mm?

1066
00:42:04,391 --> 00:42:06,306
Good for you.

1067
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:08,482
- Is your professor hot?
- No comment.

1068
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,354
Oh, that's a yes.

1069
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:13,313
Oh, come sit down.
We need to talk.

1070
00:42:13,356 --> 00:42:14,053
What are you studying?

1071
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:15,402
Ethics.

1072
00:42:15,445 --> 00:42:16,664
Mm. Indeed. Was she ethical?

1073
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:17,970
Yes.
