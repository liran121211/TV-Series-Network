00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:43,245
is getting pressured
to join her.

180
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:45,943
So talk to your street contacts
and your C.I.s.

181
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:48,816
Alert Narcotics
of any intel you collect.

182
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,818
-Where's Cesar? No one knows.

183
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:52,384
But Sandra's definitely
hunting him.

184
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:53,734
You know, if we could
get to him first,

185
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,562
we might be able to flip him.

186
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:58,390
Use his anger against La Fiera
to sabotage his old operation.

187
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:00,305
You are not the first
to think of that.

188
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,699
In fact, a task force has been
dedicated to finding him.

189
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:04,919
But if you think you can succeed
where they've failed,

190
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:07,051
- knock yourself out.
- Yes, sir.

191
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,271
Oh, and Smitty will be
your T.O. today.

192
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:12,100
Sarge, the kid only has
a few days left as a rookie --

193
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:14,624
I'm cool with letting him
ride solo today.

194
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:16,539
You are? Oh, well, I'm not.

195
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,541
- Worth a shot.
- Anything else?

196
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,848
Yes, sir.
Lopez's wedding is now Saturday.

197
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:23,024
And you are all
officially uninvited

198
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,895
unless you hear otherwise.
Spread the word.

199
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,244
Aw, come on.

200
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:27,855
Guys, it's a <i>first</i> marriage.

201
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,465
Okay. That's it.

202
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,075
Be safe out there.

203
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:32,773
Okay, so, the wedding
is now on Saturday,

204
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:34,514
which means we have two days

205
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,820
to plan and pull off a ceremony
and a reception.

206
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,692
Can you help?

207
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:41,608
Are you kidding?

208
00:08:41,651 --> 00:08:44,219
I've been preparing for
this moment my whole life.

209
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:46,874
Y-Yeah, except it's got to be
what Angela wants.

210
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:49,659
Don't worry. I got that message
loud and clear.

211
00:08:49,703 --> 00:08:51,008
But I could use some help.

212
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:52,575
Oh, well, we figured that,

213
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,709
so we hired you an elite team.

214
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:58,276
Powerpuff Girls could totally
take out the Avengers.

215
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,452
No. They don't exist
in the same universe.

216
00:09:00,496 --> 00:09:02,237
That fight could never happen.

217
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,760
But it could, 'cause it's all
just made up anyway, right?

218
00:09:03,804 --> 00:09:04,892
There are rules.

219
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:06,502
Okay. What's the problem?

220
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,330
Silas is being difficult.

221
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:11,115
Silas has autism, and rules help
him make sense of the world.

222
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,988
Tamara, Silas,
this is my mother, Patrice.

223
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,163
You'll be helping her today.

224
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:17,339
Are you okay
with that arrangement?

225
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,733
Oh, of course.

226
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:22,910
From the outfit,
Tamara clearly has good taste.

227
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:26,087
And Silas' attention to detail
will be a godsend.

228
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,610
Now, I don't know
about the two of you,

229
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:30,657
but I do my best work
with a beverage.

230
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,136
Maybe a little food
to go along with it?

231
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,442
Yes, please.

232
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:34,661
I could eat.

233
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,751
This just might work.

234
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,100
Mm-hmm.

235
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:43,278
If you were the entitled
but not too bright son

236
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,801
of a dead drug lord,

237
00:09:44,845 --> 00:09:47,543
betrayed by your people
and hunted by apex predators,

238
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,762
where would you go?

239
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:49,893
Vegas.

240
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,416
Because?

241
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,637
I know I'm gonna die,
and I want to do it in Sin City.

242
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:56,030
Can't argue with that.

243
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:58,598
Smitty, can I ask you
a personal question?

244
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,949
I am currently single
and very open to being set up.

245
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:04,299
That's not -- I --

246
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:07,302
You must have wanted
more than this

247
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:09,173
at one point, right?

248
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:12,437
You had ambition, maybe?

249
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,657
When you were younger?

250
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,051
- You want the truth?
- I do.

251
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:20,707
Faulkner wrote, "You cannot swim
for new horizons

252
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:26,147
until you have courage
to lose sight of the shore."

253
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,714
I like the shore.

254
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:29,716
Look, I get it.

255
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,588
You want the stink of being
held back as a rookie off you.

256
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,504
And finding Cesar and flipping
him is the way to do it.

257
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:36,897
But how you gonna pull that off

258
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,073
as a rookie
with no street intel?

259
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:40,901
I'm gonna talk
to Cesar's girlfriend.

260
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,729
Half the department's
already taken a run at her.

261
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:45,296
Yeah, but I saved her life.

262
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:14,108
You don't look like
housekeeping.

263
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:16,371
Nova, right?

264
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:18,460
Like the star.

265
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:19,983
Who the hell are you?

266
00:11:20,027 --> 00:11:21,593
Dahrio Salonga.

267
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,247
My brother sends his regards.

268
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,336
Aldo. Yeah,
I met the old man once.

269
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,599
It got me arrested.

270
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:30,472
Whatever you're here for,
it's a hard pass.

271
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:32,387
- We need a cook.
- A good one.

272
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,823
Who can make a lot of product.

273
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,346
Good quality product.

274
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,174
I said pass.

275
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:38,610
Your brother runs a leaky ship.

276
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:39,611
I'm not getting back on board.

277
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:42,049
Leak's been plugged.
Permanently.

278
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:44,399
Yeah, he went down ugly.
We even gave it a name --

279
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,879
The Sato Special.

280
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:47,576
See, I don't want to know that.

281
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,186
Just like I don't
want to know you.

282
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,753
Yeah, you do.

283
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:53,060
We've been watching you.

284
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:56,759
You're not exactly
on an upward trajectory.

285
00:11:56,803 --> 00:11:58,674
Cooking for us
will get you paid.

286
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,850
- You've been watching me?
- Had to make sure

287
00:12:00,894 --> 00:12:03,113
you didn't make a deal
with the cops to get bail.

288
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:04,549
Now we know.

289
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:07,335
So we're gonna
take a ride together,

290
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:09,729
do some business.

291
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:11,339
Ride to where?

292
00:12:11,382 --> 00:12:12,732
You'll see.

293
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,777
Put down the laundry.

294
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,692
Leave the gun in the basket.

295
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,053
I'm gonna want that back.

296
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,881
Uh-huh.

297
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,274
Let's go.

298
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:37,321
Uh...

299
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,193
Can I get a jacket?

300
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,803
Sure.

301
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,457
Thank you.

302
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:57,254
Okay, I'm ready.

303
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:02,782
Give me your phone.

304
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,566
What? No.

305
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,134
No. You already got my gun. No.

306
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,092
I'm not asking.

307
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:19,189
Now let's go.

308
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:32,812
Reyna.

309
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:36,032
Look, I already spoke to
a bunch of cops.

310
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:37,729
I don't know where Cesar is.

311
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,688
I'm -- I am sorry.

312
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:41,168
Who is the happiest baby?

313
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:43,735
God, those chubby cheeks, too.

314
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:46,564
I know I owe you
for everything, okay?

315
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:48,392
For saving us.

316
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:50,612
But I don't know where Cesar is.

317
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:52,657
I haven't spoken to him
in over a week.

318
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:53,833
Then who's paying his paycheck?

319
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,357
Nobody. He's my cousin Hector.

320
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,359
I got two more cousins
even bigger back at the house.

321
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,143
Good. Though you probably
won't need them anymore

322
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:01,710
once La Fiera murders Cesar.

323
00:14:01,753 --> 00:14:04,713
Which she will 100% do
when she finds him.

324
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,367
He's only got one chance,

325
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,717
and that's to make a deal
with us --

326
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,327
witness protection.

327
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:13,026
He won't go for it.

328
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,897
He's too proud to be seen
as a rat.

329
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:16,725
Well, then it's your job
to convince him

330
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:19,946
it's not snitching
when you torpedo your enemies.

331
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,773
And it's not snitching
to stay alive long enough

332
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:24,907
to be a father to your child.

333
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,430
Look.

334
00:14:27,518 --> 00:14:29,390
There's no other way out.

335
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,000
Just have him call me.

336
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:39,922
She gonna call?

337
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,793
She'll call Cesar.
Whether or not he calls me...

338
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,012
I don't know.

339
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:44,231
Hey, stop! Hey, hey, hey!

340
00:14:44,274 --> 00:14:45,710
Stop! Hey!

341
00:14:45,754 --> 00:14:47,234
Hey, guys! Shoplifter!

342
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:48,539
Back to work.

343
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,976
♪ Everyday, sitting around

344
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:51,629

You alright?

350
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,249
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

351
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:04,338
Just -- Ow!

352
00:15:04,381 --> 00:15:05,730
Just jammed my hand.

353
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:07,036
I'll call an ambulance.

354
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,864
No, don't bother.
It's just dislocated.

355
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,431
Uh, it's happened before.

356
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:12,563
One of the occupational hazards
of working construction.

357
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:13,347
Agh!

358
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:14,348
Ooh.

359
00:15:14,391 --> 00:15:15,958
I'm good. I'm good.

360
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:20,963
As the driver,
it would be helpful

361
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:22,182
to know where we're going.

362
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:23,444
You seem nervous.

363
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,880
Nah, it's every girl's dream
to drive

364
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,274
to an undisclosed location
with two armed men.

365
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:30,799
Relax. We just need to pick up
the ingredients for the cook.

366
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:33,758
"Pick up." You mean steal?

367
00:15:33,802 --> 00:15:35,064
Just keep driving straight.

368
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,372
I'm just asking
for a little help, okay?

369
00:15:38,415 --> 00:15:40,330
It makes my job a lot harder
when the paperwork isn't right.

370
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:42,028
Nolan!

371
00:15:42,071 --> 00:15:44,595
You okay? So, I heard you got
injured in your foot pursuit.

372
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,423
Oh, I just dislocated my finger.

373
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,859
My non dominant hand.

374
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:49,557
Uh, be sore for a couple days --
I'll be good to go.

375
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,429
- That guy assaulted you?
- No, I slipped
when we came --

376
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:53,822
Oh, excuse me for a second.

377
00:15:53,865 --> 00:15:55,171
Hey, Judge, thanks for calling.

378
00:15:55,215 --> 00:15:57,086
Listen, don't worry.
I got your back.

379
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,218
Thanks. Oh, not you.

380
00:15:58,261 --> 00:15:59,741
Make sure you document
the injury.

381
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:01,264
It might seem like
it's nothing now,

382
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:02,874
but turn into an issue
down the road,

383
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:03,788
you need a paper trail.

384
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:04,702
Yes, sir.

385
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,052
Oh. Um, incidentally,

386
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:08,271
I spoke to Reyna --
Cesar's girlfriend.

387
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:09,577
I think there's a chance
he'll reach out.

388
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,666
The optimism of a rookie.

389
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:14,408
It burns bright,
and then it's gone forever.

390
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:16,410
Hey, Nolan.
Our guy just peed himself.

391
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:17,585
Take care of that, will ya?

392
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,331
This place is beautiful.

393
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:25,854
They really shouldn't
leave standing water like that.

394
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,596
It attracts mosquitoes,
and mosquitoes carry disease.

395
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,076
We'll make sure that's running
before the wedding.

396
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:31,816
And hire an exterminator.

397
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,601
Sorry,
w-we're closed for repairs.

398
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:35,124
We saw that on your website.

399
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,213
Which means you have nothing
booked for Saturday.

400
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:39,128
Right. Because we're closed
for repairs.

401
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:40,869
A pipe burst.
There was extensive damage.

402
00:16:40,912 --> 00:16:42,871
We know.
We saw it on your website.

403
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:45,265
So Mr. Nolan reached out
to your contractor

404
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:46,527
and arranged some friends

405
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,137
to come get this damage fixed
by Saturday.

406
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,878
He -- He what?

407
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,619
Mrs. Evers' son Wesley
is getting married here

408
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:53,012
on Saturday.

409
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:54,883
It won't be a big wedding,
'cause it's last-minute

410
00:16:54,926 --> 00:16:56,145
and people won't be able
to travel.

411
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:58,060
But w-we're closed --
you can't --

412
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:00,497
Oh, of course we can.
And we did.

413
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,630
And I'm gonna expect a discount,

414
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,545
since you'll be able
to start holding events here

415
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:06,373
weeks ahead of schedule.

416
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,853
Now, let's you and I discuss
what you'll be able

417
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:10,464
to provide on short notice

418
00:17:10,507 --> 00:17:12,727
and what I'm gonna
have to bring in.

419
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:15,991
Look, I don't know
what Aldo told you about me,

420
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,471
but this isn't what I do, okay?

421
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:19,647
I -- I'm a chemist.

422
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,649
I-I don't know how to pull off
a -- a heist.

423
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,129
A heist?

424
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,913
Oh, that's way fancier
than what we're gonna do.

425
00:17:24,956 --> 00:17:27,307
Nah, this is gonna be a lot of,
"Get on the floor!

426
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:28,786
This is a robbery!

427
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:31,137
Don't move, or I'll kill you!"

428
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,356
You're coming to make sure
we steal the right stuff.

429
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,751
Well, look, I have a contact
who can get us what we need.

430
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:37,621
It'll just take a few days --

431
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:39,667
We don't have a few days.

432
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,451
If we don't deliver
the product we owe,

433
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,497
things go badly for all of us.

434
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,065
Besides, why pay when we can
steal it for free?

435
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:54,464
Light 'em up.

436
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:09,784
Damn it.

437
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:12,221
It's Lucy.

438
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:13,483
What do we do?

439
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,006
Treat it like any other stop,

440
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,140
but we do not run anyone
in that car.

441
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:19,663
Lean back in your seat.

442
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:21,100
What are you doing?

443
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,450
You're out on bail,
Half-Life's got a warrant,

444
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,147
and this ride is stolen.

445
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:28,107
There's no way these cops
are gonna let us go.

446
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,109
When I pop this guy,
bail out and cap his partner.

447
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:32,198
W-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

448
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,852
Look, before we start shooting
cops in broad daylight,

449
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:37,028
can -- just let me
try something, okay?

450
00:18:37,072 --> 00:18:38,639
What?

451
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:41,032
Flirting.

452
00:18:41,076 --> 00:18:42,817
I haven't gotten a ticket
since I was 16.

453
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,861
I know how to get out of them.

454
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:45,820
Okay? Just -- Just trust me.

455
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:50,520
I'm sorry, Officer.

456
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:52,174
Was I going too fast?

457
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:53,306
Yes, ma'am.

458
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,046
You almost caused an accident.

459
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,874
We're in a hurry.
It's my brother's birthday,

460
00:18:56,918 --> 00:18:59,399
and I haven't gotten
any party supplies.

461
00:19:01,923 --> 00:19:03,142
License and registration,
please.

462
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,449
C'mon, you don't really
need that, do you?

463
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:09,235
You should come to the party
after work.

464
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:10,584
We'd have fun.

465
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:17,025
Yeah.

466
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:18,418
I bet we would.

467
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,514
Alright, I'm gonna let you go
with a warning this time.

468
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:29,298
But slow down. Okay?

469
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:30,908
Yeah, I promise.

470
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:32,040
Thank you so much.

471
00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,824
Yeah.

472
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,565
Have fun at that party.

473
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:43,225
See?

474
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:45,184
Cops are easy -- you just got to
know how to play them.

475
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,325
<i>What's up?
- We just pulled over Lucy</i>

476
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:58,632
<i>in a red SUV, definitely stolen.</i>

477
00:19:58,675 --> 00:19:59,850
She was with
two serious-looking men.

478
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,330
Any idea where they're going?

479
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,071
Negative. But she said
they were picking up supplies

480
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,986
for her brother's party.

481
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:07,249
Uh, Salonga has a brother --
Dahrio.

482
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:09,991
Uh, she could mean
he's who's with her.

483
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:12,385
And party supplies obviously
means ingredients for a cook.

484
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:13,560
<i>Where are you?</i>

485
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:14,517
Uh, south of Wilshire Park.

486
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,740
Alright, there are
three chemical storage

487
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,611
supply companies
in that vicinity.

488
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:23,265
Well, they're gonna rob
one of them.

489
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,093
And we're gonna let it happen.

490
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,464
Alright. Here we go.

491
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,683
Why do I have to go in?

492
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:50,597
I can just write down
what I need.

493
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,599
I'm a cook, not a crook.

494
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:55,036
You're whatever I say you are.

495
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,300
Hey, if anybody gets hurt,
I am out.

496
00:20:58,344 --> 00:20:59,519
That's not how it works.

497
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:02,217
You can't only be in the game
a little.

498
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,479
That's how you get killed.

499
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,264
Now come on.

<i>A silent alarm

<i>Do you want us

Yes, but advise them

until further notice.

528
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:32,568
And get an airship over there

529
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:35,528
so we can see where they go
when they leave.

I might just take you with us.

531
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:52,327
Would you like that?

532
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,416
Come on, baby.

533
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,113
That's it?

534
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,115
Uh, yeah. And --
And then we're done.

535
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,334
I'll grab one.
You get the other one.

536
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,422
I got a bad back.

537
00:23:00,466 --> 00:23:02,163
I don't care.

538
00:23:02,206 --> 00:23:04,557
We'll see how scared
you can get.

539
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:18,440
What are you doing?

540
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:20,137
Roll it out here. Uh...

541
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:21,704
Yeah, you take it
the rest of the way.

542
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,314
I'll go get Half-Life.

543
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,230
Hey. We're out of here.

544
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:27,449
Let's go.

545
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:29,277
Oh, but we were just
getting friendly.

546
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,844
Yeah, let's go right now.

547
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:32,628
Don't touch me.

548
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:34,151
Hey!

549
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:35,588
Let's move!

550
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,505
See you soon.

551
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:48,905
It's over.

552
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:50,864
They stole the precursors
for meth.

553
00:23:50,907 --> 00:23:52,213
No one was hurt.

554
00:23:52,256 --> 00:23:53,519
From the security footage,

555
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:56,086
Lucy navigated policy
and procedure perfectly.

556
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:00,047
She avoided crossing the
threshold with stolen property.

557
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,483
Where is she now?

558
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,180
I don't know.

559
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:05,487
The airship didn't get there
in time,

560
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:08,577
and Dahrio had
a switch vehicle nearby.

561
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,492
We lost her.

562
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:13,887
Well, this is where Reyna
said Cesar is hiding out.

563
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,497
I don't even know
why you're still working.

564
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,499
A busted finger gets you
a week off at least.

565
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:21,721
Cesar.

566
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,246
Don't run.

567
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:26,813
Reyna told us where to find you.

568
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,292
She shouldn't have done that.

569
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,555
I'm not making a deal.

570
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,342
Sniper!

571
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:48,095
7-Adam-15, shots fired.

572
00:24:48,138 --> 00:24:49,662
Shooter is on the roof
of a building

573
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,534
one block west of 9731 Hickory.

574
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,145
He's on the run.

575
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:59,280
Requesting backup and R.A. unit
for a gunshot victim --

576
00:24:59,323 --> 00:24:59,889
Not conscious. Not breathing.

577
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,548
You two alright?

578
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,811
22 years on the job
without incident.

579
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:11,161
One shift
with the unlucky charm --

580
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:12,641
a freaking sniper.

581
00:25:14,425 --> 00:25:16,906
I need a moment.

582
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,255
Did you manage to track
the shooter?

583
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,040
No. He even took
his shell casing.

584
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,737
But it's gotta be
La Fiera's doing.

585
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:23,652
And now that she's gotten
her revenge,

586
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:25,088
I'll bet she'll head home
to Guatemala,

587
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:27,395
lay low in friendly territory
until the dust settles.

588
00:25:27,438 --> 00:25:28,875
She was tracing Reyna's calls.

589
00:25:28,918 --> 00:25:30,093
Most likely.

590
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:31,573
And I led her straight to him.

591
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:32,705
Don't do that to yourself.

592
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:33,923
You were trying to do
the right thing.

593
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:34,837
It's not your fault.

594
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,752
I'm -

595
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:38,275
I'm sorry, will you excuse me?

596
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:39,886
I have an ADA problem.

597
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:43,367
Okay, we should have stopped it.

598
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:44,586
It was my call.

599
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,327
And Lucy handled herself
like a pro.

600
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,894
She was hot-walking
those guys around

601
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:49,548
like she had been doing it
for years.

602
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,854
She is clear that
if she is in over her head,

603
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:53,160
she can pull herself out.

604
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:54,596
She won't, and you know it.

605
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,945
There's no quit in Chen.

606
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,512
Look, she's due for a check-in
at midnight.

607
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,079
I will take
her temperature then.

608
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:00,689
If I feel like
she is in too deep,

609
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:02,343
then we can go get her.

610
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:03,431
Call me right after.

611
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:04,693
Alright.

612
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:05,868
Now I gotta go
to my second job --

613
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:08,088
planning Lopez's
emergency wedding.

614
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:10,133
Uh, plates and flatware
are under "food," right?

615
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:12,092
Yes. Even though we don't eat
the plates,

616
00:26:12,135 --> 00:26:13,354
they still fall under
the food category.

617
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:14,485
Copy that.

618
00:26:14,529 --> 00:26:16,444
Great. So, that leaves...

619
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:18,011
Flowers, music, an officiant,

620
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:19,708
the cake,
and the marriage license.

621
00:26:19,752 --> 00:26:21,710
Nope. Picked up the license
during lunch.

622
00:26:21,754 --> 00:26:22,929
And I got the music.

623
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,626
My performing arts teacher
is a cellist.

624
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,628
I told her to learn
the "Wedding March"
and some Cardi B.

625
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,543
Who? Uh, never mind.

626
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,631
She's -- She's joking.

627
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:32,199
I -- I feel bad.

628
00:26:32,242 --> 00:26:33,983
W-Why?

629
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:35,855
Well, this is
for something special.

630
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:36,769
Tamara and I are doing it
for money.

631
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:37,900
It doesn't feel right.

632
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:39,554
Oh, nonsense.

633
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,164
You two are providing a service.

634
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,514
It has value,
and you should get paid for it.

635
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:45,473
It doesn't make your help
any less special.

636
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,257
Or appreciated. Okay?

637
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:48,650
Okay.

638
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:50,391
Seriously, who is Cardi B?

639
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:51,610
Let me show you a video.

640
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:53,133
Unh-unh. No.

641
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:54,047
Ah, Mr. Del Monte.

642
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,048
Uh, y-you have a second?

643
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:56,223
Ah, Nolan. Uh, not really.

644
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:57,485
Actually, I'm kind of late
for dinner.

645
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:59,008
You charged my shoplifter
with felony assault.

646
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:00,488
Why?

647
00:27:00,531 --> 00:27:02,359
Look at your hand.

648
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:03,622
I slipped and fell.

649
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,841
While in pursuit of the suspect.

650
00:27:05,885 --> 00:27:07,321
Wouldn't have happened if
he hadn't committed the crime.

651
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,931
He committed a misdemeanor.

652
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:11,194
We can't up-charge him to
a felony because I was clumsy.

653
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:13,022
No, relax.
It's not gonna go to trial.

654
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:14,415
This guy's gonna plead out.

655
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,852
I'll knock it down
to, like, reckless endangerment.

656
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,941
He'll get a couple years'
probation, tops. It's fine.

657
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:20,813
And a felony on his record,
which will affect

658
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,423
every aspect of his life
from here on out.

659
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:23,816
How can that be justice?

660
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,339
Okay, look, I know
you're still new to all this,

661
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:27,689
but that's exactly what it is --
it's justice.

662
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:28,951
And actually,
last time I checked,

663
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:30,779
I had a pretty
sterling reputation

664
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:32,085
with your police union, so...

665
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:34,696
It's still wrong,
and you know it.

666
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,133
How about this --

667
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:39,222
I won't tell you
how to arrest them,

668
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,834
and you don't tell me
how to charge them.

669
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,052
Good talk.

670
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:50,843
You made it! Come in!

671
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,584
Thank you, again. I washed it.

672
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:54,716
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

673
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,587
Oh, good, 'cause I didn't.

674
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:58,198
Seconds ago, on your doorstep,

675
00:27:58,241 --> 00:27:59,808
I realized a better person
would've washed it,

676
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,854
so I said I did, but...

677
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:03,638
now I'm caught
in a tangle of lies.

678
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:06,728
Bailey, this is Fiona.

679
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:07,990
Hello.

680
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:10,253
Hi. I-I didn't realize
it was a party.

681
00:28:10,297 --> 00:28:11,690
-A party? No. Uh, sorry.

682
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,909
I w-would've called you, um,

683
00:28:13,953 --> 00:28:16,477
but I don't know your last name
and I didn't have your number.

684
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,175
Uh, Fiona Ryan is my ethics
and law professor.

685
00:28:19,219 --> 00:28:21,395
She's helping me
with an emergency work issue.

686
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:22,483
But you're welcome to stay.

687
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:24,093
I-I want you to stay.

688
00:28:24,137 --> 00:28:25,051
Will there still be food?

689
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:26,269
Yes. Then I'll stay.

690
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:27,575
Excellent choice.

691
00:28:29,403 --> 00:28:31,057
So, what's the issue?

692
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,494
John just became aware
of the systemic problem

693
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:35,714
of overcharging
in the justice system.

694
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:38,455
Okay, when you say it like that,
you make me sound naive.

695
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:39,805
I had a wobbler today.

696
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:41,197
It's a crime
that could be charged

697
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:43,286
either as a misdemeanor
or a felony.

698
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,462
Yes, and the ADA went ahead
and charged it as a felony

699
00:28:45,506 --> 00:28:46,899
even though it was not one.

700
00:28:46,942 --> 00:28:50,163
Things are so much more simple
in the UCMJ.

701
00:28:50,206 --> 00:28:52,208
Uniform Code
of Military Justice.

702
00:28:52,252 --> 00:28:54,123
I thought
you were a firefighter.

703
00:28:54,167 --> 00:28:57,170
I am. I'm also a reserve
in the Army National Guard.

704
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:59,128
And a Capoeira instructor,

705
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:00,782
in case you ever want to
learn dance fighting.

706
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:03,176
Ooh, I love dance fighting.

707
00:29:03,219 --> 00:29:05,395
Oh, it's the most
excellent workout.

708
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,876
I do it every Thursday night
after I volunteer at the ACLU.

709
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,182
Okay, between the two of you,

710
00:29:09,225 --> 00:29:10,923
I'm officially starting
to feel like a slacker.

711
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:12,663
Good.

712
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:14,491
So, why can't you just go
to this D.A. guy

713
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:16,015
and ask him
not to charge a felony?

714
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:17,407
Well, cops don't decide
on the charges.

715
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:18,800
The D.A.'s office does that.

716
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:21,542
Oh, do not leave out
the department's complicity

717
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:23,457
in this problem, John.

718
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,807
Police officers are ordered
to write up

719
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:27,809
almost all wobblers as felonies.

720
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:30,029
-Mm.
-Not ordered.
Strongly encouraged.

721
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:32,031
And where we don't,

722
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:35,338
the D.A. almost always upcharges
to the felony anyway.

723
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:36,862
So, what are you gonna do?

724
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:38,994
And don't let the fact
that this decision will tell me

725
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:40,691
everything I need to know
about you as a person

726
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,128
sway your choice.

727
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:45,044
Oh, I like her.

728
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:47,524
I like you. Mm-hmm.

729
00:29:47,568 --> 00:29:48,264
Lucy missed her check-in.

730
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,657
She's cooking.

731
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,789
You don't know that for sure.

732
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:51,964
She's either cooking
or she's dead.

733
00:29:52,007 --> 00:29:53,008
She's not dead.

734
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:54,575
Then she's making product.

735
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:56,707
From the chemicals she stole,
we know it's meth.

736
00:29:56,751 --> 00:29:59,623
Alright, that takes
four to eight hours.

737
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,625
Look, you and I both know
it's against the law

738
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:04,411
for her to allow product
she cooked to hit the streets.

739
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:07,414
If we don't find her, she's
gonna stop it by herself...

740
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:08,850
or die trying.

741
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:13,507
Are you done?

742
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,856
No. I'm just getting started.

743
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,118
It's gonna take me all night.

744
00:30:16,162 --> 00:30:18,468
Why? You've been at it
for three hours already.

745
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:20,253
I want it finished
and out the door by sunrise.

746
00:30:20,296 --> 00:30:22,037
Yeah, and I want a mansion
and a yacht,

747
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:23,604
but I'm dealing
with chemicals that explode

748
00:30:23,647 --> 00:30:25,824
if you look at them funny,
so I'll take the time I need.

749
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:30,306
It's out by sunrise,

750
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,351
or it's over.

751
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,137
Where's the rest of it?

752
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,965
The lab you built me
was undersized,

753
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:21,792
so I only had enough time
to make one batch.

754
00:31:21,836 --> 00:31:23,925
Why the hell
are you telling me that now?

755
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:26,319
'Cause I wasn't in the mood
to have this conversation.

756
00:31:28,408 --> 00:31:30,105
I'm done with your attitude.

757
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,760
I can find another cook.

758
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,980
Wait, wait. Look, I'm sorry.

759
00:31:35,023 --> 00:31:37,373
It's -- It's been a long night.

760
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:39,375
But I can make some more.

761
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,116
And it'll be quicker this time.
I promise.

762
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,509
Do it.

763
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:44,685
But I'm not waiting.

764
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:46,948
Half-Life will stay
while you cook.

765
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:49,429
I gotta get this
out on the street.

766
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:50,996
It should all go out together.

767
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:55,304
Why?

768
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:17,457
Aah!

769
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:22,636
Hey. It's me.

770
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:24,855
La Fiera's here.
Mission Road -- hurry.

771
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:29,382
Okay, I-I give up, I give up!

772
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:32,559
<i>iNo más! iNo más!</i>

773
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:34,256
It's okay. It's okay. Amiga.

774
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,692
Amiga!

775
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:36,998
Amiga, huh?

776
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:39,218
Who says I need a friend?

777
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:40,436
Everybody needs a friend.

778
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,873
Especially one
with certain skills.

779
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,136
You want to come work for me?

780
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:46,007
It's clearly my best option.

781
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:47,791
I haven't said
it was an option yet.

782
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:53,014
I hear you're running
Aldo's operation.

783
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:54,276
You owe product
to the Madrigal family,

784
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,843
which means
you owe it to me now.

785
00:32:55,886 --> 00:32:58,324
Sure. No problem.

786
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,413
I can give you half right now.

787
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:02,197
It's already in the truck.

788
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,112
And she can make the rest.

789
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:07,724
She can?

790
00:33:07,768 --> 00:33:09,117
Then what do I need you for?

791
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:10,553
Wait.

792
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:18,344
You can make the rest, right?

793
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:20,041
Yes, ma'am.
There's enough chemicals here.

794
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:21,869
I just...

795
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:23,784
I need my hands free.

796
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:33,881
You look familiar to me.

797
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:35,317
I can't imagine why.

798
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:38,016
We've never met.

799
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,366
I'm not so sure.

800
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:43,847
I have a very good memory
for faces.

801
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:45,545
I --

802
00:33:45,588 --> 00:33:47,155
I swear, I'd remember you.

803
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:48,461
You're unforgettable.

804
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:49,418
I'm just a nobody.

805
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:55,207
You're not a nobody, are you?

806
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,469
No, I'm a cop.

807
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:58,123
And you're under arrest.

808
00:33:58,166 --> 00:34:00,821
You stole my line.

809
00:34:00,864 --> 00:34:02,301
I thought you said
she needed rescuing.

810
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,306
Turn around, <i>Hermana.
Hands behind your back.</i>

811
00:34:08,437 --> 00:34:10,178
I told you it was gonna end
this way.

812
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,052
You okay?

813
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,880
Let's just go with yes.

814
00:34:16,924 --> 00:34:18,404
How'd you guys get here so fast?

815
00:34:18,447 --> 00:34:20,014
Not that I'm complaining.

816
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,320
When you didn't report in
last night,

817
00:34:21,363 --> 00:34:22,669
Sergeant Grey called the chief,

818
00:34:22,712 --> 00:34:24,236
who called
every law enforcement agency

819
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:25,541
in Southern California.

820
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:28,588
400 cops just spent
the night looking for you.

821
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:31,112
Wow.

822
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:34,507
I told you to leave it alone.

823
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,596
You did. And I didn't.

824
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,076
And now he's got me on his side.

825
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:42,123
Okay, fine.

826
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:43,864
I'll -- I'll knock down

827
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:46,127
the assault charge
on his shoplifter.

828
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,563
Not good enough.

829
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:48,608
I just got off the phone
with three other

830
00:34:48,651 --> 00:34:50,392
division watch commanders.

831
00:34:50,436 --> 00:34:52,829
As of tomorrow,
we're instructing
all our officers

832
00:34:52,873 --> 00:34:55,354
to treat wobblers
as a misdemeanor,

833
00:34:55,397 --> 00:34:57,138
never a felony,

834
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:59,271
unless there's
damn good reason to.

835
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:00,881
And if you keep overcharging,

836
00:35:00,924 --> 00:35:02,100
you're gonna lose
the cooperation

837
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:04,058
of the arresting officers.

838
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:07,105
Good luck making a plea deal
after that.

839
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,586
Expect a call from the D.A.

840
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,674
Maybe even the mayor.

841
00:35:11,718 --> 00:35:13,285
They have the number.

842
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:16,244
And you -- don't ever come
calling for a favor.

843
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:22,163
You just made an enemy
at the D.A.'s office.

844
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:23,208
Was it worth it?

845
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:24,296
Absolutely, sir.

846
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:25,427
Good.

847
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:26,428
Get back to work.

848
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:29,344
I'll be out of here
before you know it.

849
00:35:29,388 --> 00:35:30,867
No, you won't.

850
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:33,087
You can lie to yourself about it
if you want,

851
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,828
just like you lied to yourself
about Diego.

852
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:37,961
What the hell
are you talking about?

853
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:40,312
Cesar might have sent
the shooter who killed him,

854
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:42,140
but you loaded the gun.

855
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:44,403
You crossed a line with Diego
you said you never would.

856
00:35:44,446 --> 00:35:48,058
You used him as a cover to talk
to Cesar's father.

857
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:50,452
You hung the target
around your son's neck.

858
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:53,107
He's dead because of you, <i>
Hermana.</i>

859
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,849
And deep down, you know it.

860
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:11,169
This is amazing.

861
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:12,779
I can't believe you pulled it
together in two days.

862
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:14,737
No, it was a team effort.

863
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:17,479
Quarterbacked by Patrice.

864
00:36:17,523 --> 00:36:19,786
Thank you for being there for me
during the craziness.

865
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:21,309
I know it hasn't been easy.

866
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:23,093
Oh, you owe me forever.

867
00:36:23,137 --> 00:36:24,791
I mean, you could save my life
like three times

868
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:25,879
and we still wouldn't be even.

869
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:27,141
I know.

870
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,360
Is there anything I can do?

871
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:29,970
Set up chairs? Arrange flowers?

872
00:36:30,013 --> 00:36:31,493
No. You're the bride.

873
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:34,061
Just relax, enjoy.

874
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:36,194
I need superglue,
hair pins, and your badge.

875
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:37,151
Why my badge?

876
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:39,893
I'll handle this.

877
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:41,547
You should go get ready.

878
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,809
This wedding
is starting on time.

879
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:44,724
Yes, sir.

880
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:53,341
Mom, this is perfect.

881
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:54,255
You finally used your powers
for good.

882
00:36:55,952 --> 00:36:58,259
Well, it was nice having a
practice run for the real thing.

883
00:36:58,303 --> 00:37:00,392
I'm thinking next June
in Tuscany.

884
00:37:00,435 --> 00:37:02,829
No, Mom, this is our wedding.

885
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:05,223
The only wedding. We'll see.

886
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:07,355
So, we just realized
that Lopez doesn't have

887
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:08,878
her something old,
something new,

888
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:10,489
something borrowed,
something blue.

889
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:13,056
Oh. Uh, let's see.

890
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,232
Hmm.

891
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:17,800
My grandmother wore this
at her wedding.

892
00:37:17,844 --> 00:37:19,149
Should be old enough, I think.

893
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:20,020
Yes. Thank you.

894
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,630
Yeah.

895
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:24,067
Oh, great, she'll be wearing
my brooch.

896
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:26,287
Welcome.
Please sit wherever you like.

897
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:27,767
And the bar is open.

898
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,725
Thank you.
Thank you very much, my friend.

899
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:31,031
Alright.

900
00:37:31,074 --> 00:37:33,076
And thank you, by the way,
for being my plus-one.

901
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,731
I hope it's not too weird that
our first date is a wedding.

902
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,472
Well, technically,
our first date was a TED Talk

903
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:39,126
on prosecutorial abuse.

904
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:41,563
Ah. To be fair, you came
into my life wearing a towel.

905
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:42,999
I felt compelled
to be unexpected.

906
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:44,827
Puts a lot of pressure
on our first kiss.

907
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:46,264
Good. I like a challenge.

908
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:48,309
I need to borrow something.

909
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:50,093
Oh, hi. Jackson.
Good to meet you.

910
00:37:50,137 --> 00:37:51,704
Bailey. And you too.

911
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:53,009
- What do you need?
- Doesn't matter.

912
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:55,708
Ah, something borrowed. Okay.

913
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:58,319
Perfect. Henry made me this
when he was in third grade.

914
00:37:58,363 --> 00:37:59,451
It's my good luck charm.

915
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:00,669
I'm gonna want that back.

916
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:02,192
Of course. Thank you.

917
00:38:02,236 --> 00:38:04,151
Bye.

918
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:05,500
Shall we? Yes.

919
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:09,939
Ooh!
Uh, nice pocket square, sir.

920
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:13,291
Could I, um, maybe borrow it
for a few hours?

921
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,293
What? No.

922
00:38:15,336 --> 00:38:16,990
It pulls together
the whole outfit.

923
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,035
It's for Lopez, sir.

924
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:26,652
It better come back spotless.

925
00:38:26,695 --> 00:38:28,001
Thank you.

926
00:38:28,044 --> 00:38:31,134
As I was saying --
first Nolan, now Chen.

927
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:33,746
Turned out to be
a pretty good teacher.

928
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:35,878
Forget undercover work -- you
might have found your calling.

929
00:38:35,922 --> 00:38:39,317
Here's the thing, sir --
it's all my calling.

930
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,580
If I were to go into politics
this afternoon,

931
00:38:41,623 --> 00:38:43,582
I would be president
in four years.

932
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:46,324
I believe it.

933
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,368
Officer Chen.

934
00:38:47,412 --> 00:38:48,891
Look at you!

935
00:38:48,935 --> 00:38:50,632
Triumph suits you.

936
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:51,938
Thank you, sir.

937
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:54,549
Thank you both
for believing in me.

938
00:38:54,593 --> 00:38:57,247
Well, the hardest part
is still ahead --

939
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,858
adrenaline crash.

940
00:38:58,901 --> 00:39:00,381
Monday morning,

941
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:03,166
it is back to transients
-and noise complaints.
-Yeah.

942
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,299
To tell the truth,
I kind of missed it.

943
00:39:07,475 --> 00:39:09,172
Um, will you excuse me?

944
00:39:09,216 --> 00:39:11,958
Yeah.

Nice suit.

948
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:20,923
Nova would be impressed.

949
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,490
Nova was a little thirsty.

950
00:39:22,534 --> 00:39:24,231
I like to think of her
as assertive.

951
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:26,407
Mm.

952
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:30,411
First solo op, and you take down
two major drug traffickers.

953
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:33,066
Not bad.

954
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:34,633

Uh, something borrowed --

Nolan says this is lucky,

971
00:40:13,846 --> 00:40:15,630
so that should cancel out
the brooch.

972
00:40:15,674 --> 00:40:18,285
And something blue --

973
