1
00:00:01,392 --> 00:00:02,654
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

2
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:04,830
You both will receive
letters of reprimand.

3
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:06,528
Officer Nolan, you have to pass

4
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:09,270
- a review board test to advance.
- Yes, sir.

5
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:11,837
Any hopes of making
detective should be abandoned.

6
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:13,535
- What's going on?
- Turns out I'm predisposed

7
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:15,058
to fragile X syndrome.

8
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,756
- If my DNA --
- Stop.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,715
I'll make an appointment
to see your mom's doctor.

10
00:00:19,758 --> 00:00:21,586
- Get your hands off my wife!
- Everybody on the ground!

11
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,458
We need a supervisor out here.
Code 3.

12
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:25,547
You questioned every move I
made. Don't let it happen again.

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,766
He's a disgrace to the badge.
He has to go.

14
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,986
- So how do I get him?
- Chronicle every offense.

15
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,857
When we get enough,
we go to I.A.

16
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:34,077
- Doug Stanton. He was your T.O.
- What about him?

17
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:36,079
Wondering if you liked
the way he does business.

18
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:38,603
Preserve the evidence.
I'm gonna take our
friend back to the shop.

19
00:00:38,647 --> 00:00:40,257
Doug's about to beat
the crap out of a suspect.

20
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:41,606
I told you to guard the drugs.

21
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,955
The last rookie did
everything I told him to.

22
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:44,479
Guy's name was Owens.
You know him?

23
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,220
I had to write a blue page up
on the kid.

24
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:49,658
I can personally attest to
Officer West being a solid cop.

25
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:53,444
It'd be such a waste to have him
wash out of the program.

26
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:55,925
♪ Something in the water

27
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:58,449
I still can't believe Doug's
rookie threw you under the bus.

28
00:00:58,493 --> 00:01:00,538
Can we please not talk about it?

29
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:03,193
Like, I just want to watch some
trashy TV and shut my brain off.

30
00:01:03,237 --> 00:01:04,673
Mm-hmm.

31
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:07,154
Food porn...

32
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:10,418
...house porn or...

33
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:11,810
...true crime.

34
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:13,290
True crime, for sure.

35
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,120
Oh. That's weird.

36
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,951
It's Sergeant Grey.

37
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,130
- Sir.
- Can I come in?

38
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:29,089
Sure. Yeah.

39
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:30,829
Officer Chen,
can you give us a minute?

40
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:32,788
Yes. Of course.

41
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:36,661
Hey, I'm just gonna fill her in
as soon as you leave, so...

42
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:39,099
That's your call.

43
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:41,492
So, uh, what's going on?

44
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:42,885
So, Officer Stanton
came by my office

45
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:45,279
at the end of shift tonight.

46
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:47,803
He issued you a blue page
for disobeying an order

47
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:49,805
and leaving evidence unattended.

48
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:53,156
He set me up. Look,
I only left that evidence

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,158
-because I thought he was
gonna hurt our suspect.
Doesn't matter.

50
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:57,160
You're still his rookie,
and you disobeyed his order.

51
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:59,380
As long as he's your T.O.,
he has the power to keep

52
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:00,946
issuing you blue pages

53
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,341
until you're bounced
out of the program.

54
00:02:04,385 --> 00:02:05,908
So I'm pulling the plug,

55
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:07,866
assigning you
a new training officer.

56
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,217
-No. Sir --
It's not
your decision, son.

57
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,741
I'm not gonna see your career
ended before it begins.

58
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,525
Not for the likes
of Doug Stanton.

59
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,005
I don't want a career

60
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:18,138
if it means making way
for cops like Stanton.

61
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,618
Just give me one more chance.

62
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:22,446
I know this guy.
He -- He's a bully.

63
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,362
Like, if I act shook and beg for
forgiveness, he'll believe it.

64
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,843
Please, sir. We cannot
give up on this now.

65
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:30,019
Do you understand if
you're fired as a rookie,

66
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:31,281
you're radioactive?

67
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,979
No law-enforcement agency
will touch you.

68
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:37,374
You will <i>never</i> become
a police officer.

69
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,159
Are you really willing
to risk that?

70
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,033
Without hesitation.

71
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:03,400
Sorry for the wait.

72
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,054
Do you have the test results?

73
00:03:05,097 --> 00:03:06,708
Your husband's not joining us?

74
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:08,449
Fiancé.

75
00:03:08,492 --> 00:03:11,321
And no. He thinks I'm taking
the test next week.

76
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:14,237
I don't understand.

77
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,805
I love him,
but he sprung this on me,

78
00:03:16,848 --> 00:03:20,374
and I don't know
what I'll do if it's real.

79
00:03:20,417 --> 00:03:22,332
Well, it's not.

80
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,987
Your amnio came back
negative for fragile X,

81
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,730
as well as all other
major genetic disorders.

82
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:30,645
So my baby's okay?

83
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,082
Yes.

84
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:35,084
Thank you.

85
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,571
He gave Jacksona blue page?

86
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,486
- It's not your fault.
- Of course it is.

87
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,488
I'm the one that reached out to
Doug's old rookie to get dirt on him.

88
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:49,098
What's a blue page? Who's Doug?

89
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:50,578
- It's a failed evaluation.
- None of your business.

90
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,188
Any way I could get
some breakfast?

91
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,059
We arrested you
for stealing bagels.

92
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:54,886
Yeah, but I didn't
get to eat any.

93
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,631
-Can you take her to processing?

94
00:04:00,675 --> 00:04:02,677
Oh. Uh, de-escalate.

95
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,200
We do not want to
make things worse for Jackson.

96
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,854
Hey, Stanton, you ever
want to brush up on any

97
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,986
arrest-control techniques,
I'm available.

98
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,161
- Any time.
- Yeah? How about now?

99
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:11,990
- Let's go.
- We are on duty, so come on.

100
00:04:12,034 --> 00:04:13,427
Aw. That's sweet.

101
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,038
Your hot little boot's
trying to rescue you.

102
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,779
You're the one that's gonna need rescuing.

103
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:19,650
-Are you threatening me?
Oh, I'm just saying.

104
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:20,999
I have a great
hair-pull take-down

105
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:23,088
that I have been dying to try.

106
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:25,352
All right. Come on, Boot.
We got a suspect to book.

107
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,005
What a joke.

108
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,311
What happened to "De-escalate,

109
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:29,399
we don't want to make things
harder for Jackson"?

110
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:30,748
I don't know. That was super weird.

111
00:04:30,792 --> 00:04:32,620
I feel like I had a
testosterone contact high.

112
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,361
All right. Look. Keep in close
contact with Jackson today.

113
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:36,058
If they call for backup
of any kind, we're there.

114
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:36,711
Agreed.

115
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,550
Hey. Hey! Looking good.

116
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,595
Oh, I hate dressing for court.

117
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,771
It reminds me of
custody hearings for Lila.

118
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:56,252
You are studying
down to the wire, I see.

119
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,428
My entire career depends

120
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:00,212
on how I do on this
disciplinary exam.

121
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,737
So if my locker is cleaned out
by the time you get back,

122
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,347
it's been nice knowing you.

123
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,044
Okay. The only way
that you fail at this

124
00:05:06,088 --> 00:05:07,785
is if you let fear take over.

125
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:11,049
Anxiety, it --
it lives in your muscles.

126
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:14,052
So the only way to get rid of it
is to shake it out.

127
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:15,489
You mean literally shake?

128
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:18,579
Mm-hmm. It's what I do.
Come on. Try it.

129
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,322
Oh, come on. That's lame.

130
00:05:22,365 --> 00:05:25,368
You want to ace this exam,
you got to shake it out!

131
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,948
Oh. Oh. Okay. So, you
know what, Detective Harper?

132
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:42,080
See, sometimes this
angelic countenance

133
00:05:42,124 --> 00:05:43,865
betrays how devilish you truly are.

134
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:46,650
Oh, that was good. Okay.

135
00:05:46,694 --> 00:05:48,435
I got to go, but listen.

136
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,612
You are gonna kick ass at
this exam, I have no doubt.

137
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:59,489
Officer West.

138
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,491
Figured you would've
pulled the rip cord,

139
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:03,145
asked for a new T.O.

140
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:05,495
No, sir. That's, uh...

141
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,323
That's not what I want.

142
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,412
Really? 'Cause your friends
are sure looking for a fight.

143
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:11,806
Yeah. Well, I'm not.

144
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,982
Sir, I've wanted to be a
cop since I was a toddler,

145
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:15,853
and I can't afford
to stumble now.

146
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:20,031
So from here on out, I've
got your six no matter what, sir.

147
00:06:23,557 --> 00:06:24,949
Final question.

148
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:27,169
Duty Manual Volume One,

149
00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:31,652
Section 210, Point 46,
Paragraph 2 states?

150
00:06:31,695 --> 00:06:34,481
An employee's obligation to
report and prevent misconduct

151
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:37,092
begins the moment that employee
becomes a member

152
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:39,224
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

153
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,883
Congratulations, Officer Nolan.

154
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:48,364
You passed. 98%.

155
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,366
Really? Which one did I miss?

156
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,672
That's -- You know what?
Never mind.

157
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:52,673
That's -- Uh, sorry. Thank you.

158
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:56,764
This is a relief
to have this behind me.

159
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:58,940
It's in your records forever.

160
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:02,073
Yes, but certainly this mark
has to help my case.

161
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,207
In becoming a detective.

162
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:10,342
Your letter of reprimand
has been CC'd

163
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:13,215
to every lieutenant and captain
in the department.

164
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:15,130
Trust me.
They have long memories.

165
00:07:15,173 --> 00:07:17,698
So for you to even
be considered for detective,

166
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:20,309
every one of them
would have to retire,

167
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:22,964
and most of those guys
are younger than you.

168
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:27,011
Well, I've beaten
the odds before.

169
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:29,797
Nolan, um...

170
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,799
you're a good cop with a --

171
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:35,716
a long... ish career
ahead of you.

172
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,503
But detective is no longer
in your path.

173
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,723
You need to make peace
with that.

174
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,639
Yes, sir.

175
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,554
Oh, one more thing.

176
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:49,294
Since Harper's in court
this afternoon,

177
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:51,601
you'll be working
the front desk.

178
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,385
Yes, sir.

179
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,739
Hi. I'm here to check some
evidence out for court.

180
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,088
And I need to log some in.

181
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:01,655
Forms?

182
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:02,917
You're new, right?

183
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:06,094
Riley started a week ago.

184
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:07,530
We bonded while I logged in

185
00:08:07,574 --> 00:08:09,576
about a million
stolen credit cards.

186
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,361
You remember that, Ri?

187
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,189
You're so bad.
She'll get fired if command

188
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:15,930
catches her fraternizing
with cops.

189
00:08:15,973 --> 00:08:19,237
Yeah, I know, but deep down,
I can tell she likes me.

190
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,717
Isn't that right, Ri?

191
00:08:20,761 --> 00:08:22,850
-You're right. It's palpable.

192
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:24,112
Sign here.

193
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:25,766
How long till these
lab results come back?

194
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,246
Not my job.

195
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,249
My body is creating life faster
than our lab processes evidence.

196
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:33,034
So, what's the plan for today?

197
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:35,558
Premise check some seedy SROs?
Maybe hit up warrant units,

198
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,255
see if they need any
violent felons picked up?

199
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,606
First we need to talk.
Off the record.

200
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,133
You mind?

201
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:46,917
It's, uh -- It's turned off.

202
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:48,571
We both know that once
you turn it back on,

203
00:08:48,615 --> 00:08:51,443
the recording automatically
goes back two minutes.

204
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:53,315
I want this to stay between us.

205
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:02,977
Look, I had no choice with
the blue page. You boxed me in.

206
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,633
Look, I know. I-I messed up.
I-I should've come to you.

207
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:08,417
- I would've listened.
- I'm sorry.

208
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,984
You know, I've seen it before.

209
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,855
You think I'm too hard-core
because you're a millennial

210
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:15,076
full of kid-glove ideals and
everyone deserves a trophy.

211
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:18,514
But the streets don't work
like that. All right?

212
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,908
And you're too good a cop
to end up a security guard.

213
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:23,780
That's why I am begging you
for a second shot.

214
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:27,349
Look, I will be
the best rookie/partner

215
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:29,525
that you've ever had.

216
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,831
Please.

217
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:39,448
- To a fresh start.
- Fresh start.

218
00:09:41,015 --> 00:09:42,190
Thank you, sir.

219
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:43,408
All right.

220
00:09:45,323 --> 00:09:47,674
Excuse me. Uh, can you help me?

221
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:49,284
Someone stole my bike.

222
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:51,373
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let's get you started.

223
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,984
- Fill out one of these and
bring it right back to me.
- Thanks.

224
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,899
You're being released on an 849,

225
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:57,031
which means
we're not charging you.

226
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:58,859
Does this mean I get
the bagels back?

227
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:00,425
No. The bagels were disposed of.

228
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,340
Do you know how bad that is
for the environment?

229
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:05,126
I'm a freegan. That goes
against my whole ethos.

230
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,736
Real freegans forage for food
in the Dumpster.

231
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,433
They don't steal from bakeries.

232
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:10,348
Dumpsters are gross.

233
00:10:10,392 --> 00:10:11,872
Look, could you at least call me
a cab? I don't believe in money.

234
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:13,700
No. Sorry.
It's against our ethos.

235
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:17,704
How was your exam?

236
00:10:17,747 --> 00:10:18,835
Uh, passed.

237
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,316
Oh. Well....
don't sound so excited.

238
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,492
Oh. No. It's just, um...

239
00:10:23,535 --> 00:10:25,450
Grey confirmed
I'd never make detective.

240
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:27,714
You mean you still
thought you had a shot?

241
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:29,541
In my heart, I just -- I hoped.

242
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,718
Hey! Some chick's trying to
steal a car in your parking lot!

243
00:10:34,982 --> 00:10:37,071
-Yes.

244
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:39,421
- You're under arrest -- again.
- Freegan rights.

245
00:10:39,464 --> 00:10:40,509
Step over here.

246
00:10:40,552 --> 00:10:43,164
Hands behind your back.
Stay there.

247
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,819
At least your mug shot
and your prints are still good.

248
00:10:48,386 --> 00:10:50,084
Excuse me! Officer?

249
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,912
I'll take care of this.

250
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,656
Sorry. Employee parking only.

251
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:57,482
You want public parking,
it's back --

252
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:01,008
Don't speak.
Do exactly as I say.

253
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:03,924
Right hand up. Left hand
takes out your radio.

254
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,926
Put it on the seat.

255
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:08,276
Hey. Eyes on me.

256
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,886
Radio. Now. Let's go.

257
00:11:11,932 --> 00:11:14,935
Now both hands unhook your belt.

258
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:16,937
Put it on the ground.

259
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:21,289
Your backup piece next.
Come on. I know you got one.

260
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:27,208
Climb in and shut the door.

261
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,953
Into the back.
And don't even think about

262
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:35,825
trying to charge me, Officer...

263
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:37,566
Nolan.

264
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:39,611
Let's go.

265
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,838
- Is that a --
- Big-ass bomb? Oh, yeah.

266
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:51,928
I set that baby off, everybody
in a two-block radius is dead.

267
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,501
You see those handcuffs on
the side wall? Put them on.

268
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:03,723
Tight. Let's go.

269
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:10,686
Tighter than that, man.

270
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:21,175
You know what this is?

271
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:24,918
-That's a dead man's switch.

272
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:26,397
That's right.

273
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:30,097
Anything doesn't go my way,
I release this, we go boom.

274
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,317
You try and be a hero,
I release this, and we go boom.

275
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:37,626
Nolan, you so much as look at me
funny, I release this --

276
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:38,845
And we go boom. I get it.

277
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,411
You're not gonna get
any trouble from me.

278
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:43,414
I want to make it through this,
and I hope you do, too.

279
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,807
I'm imagining you have some

280
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:46,983
pretty powerful motivations
for doing this?

281
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:48,768
Shut up, man. You and I
are not gonna be friends.

282
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:53,033
Get your supervisor
on a private channel.

283
00:12:53,076 --> 00:12:55,644
So, Nolan
aced the test.
- I knew he would.

284
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:57,472
<i>Sergeant Grey,
this is Officer Nolan.</i>

285
00:12:57,515 --> 00:13:00,083
<i>Go to channel 9.</i>

286
00:13:00,127 --> 00:13:03,478
Why is your rookie radioing me
from the front desk?

287
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,132
Nolan, this better be important.

288
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,569
<i>It sure is, buddy.</i>

289
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,398
-Who's this?
<i>The guy
in your parking lot</i>

290
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:12,661
<i>with an ammonium nitrate
fertilizer bomb</i>

291
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:14,489
<i>powerful enough
to turn your station</i>

292
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:16,796
<i>and the surrounding
neighborhood into a crater.</i>

293
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,016
If you think I'm lying,
you can ask Officer Nolan here.

294
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,062
I'm afraid
I can confirm that, sir.

295
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:24,716
<i>Now, I know your first
instinct is going to be to</i>

296
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,458
<i>evacuate the building,
but that is not gonna happen.</i>

297
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:30,679
I have cameras on every exit.
Do you understand me?

298
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,768
If anyone leaves, everyone dies.

299
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:36,032
I can confirm the cameras, sir.

300
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:38,295
-Secure all exits now.
<i>Then your next instinct</i>

301
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,384
<i>will be to try
and neutralize me.</i>

302
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:42,865
<i>But tell him why that would be
a mistake, Officer Nolan.</i>

303
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:45,128
Our bomber has
a dead man's switch, sir.

304
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:50,351
Okay. You have my attention.
Tell me what I can do for you.

305
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:53,658
<i>Rectify an extreme miscarriage of justice.</i>

306
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:56,487
I demand the immediate release
of Donald Feltt

307
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:59,708
from the Primedale
Department of Corrections.

308
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,928
Hold on.

309
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,541
So, are we talking about
Donald Feltt who's serving

310
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:09,239
a life sentence for murder
and drug trafficking?

311
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:11,981
<i>That's him. And there's not gonna
be a backdoor <i>parole for my boy.</i>

312
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,809
Feltt walks out of there today.

313
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,245
Backdoor parole?

314
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:16,725
Jailhouse slang for
when you die in prison.

315
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:17,987
Our bomber's done time.

316
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:20,076
Most likely with Feltt.

317
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,905
All right. That's a big ask.
It'll take time.

318
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:24,298
Well, then get started.

319
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,039
We need someone on the outside
to go to Primedale.

320
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:29,259
I'll call Lopez.
She left already.

321
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:31,914
So, all units,
be advised we are going into

322
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:34,395
tactical alert
at Mid-Wilshire Station.

323
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,397
All civilians
and non-essential personnel

324
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,313
report to Level D
of the underground garage.

325
00:14:39,356 --> 00:14:41,837
Level D? That's where
the station sheltered in place

326
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,143
during the missile alert.

327
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:45,319
What the hell is going on?

328
00:14:45,362 --> 00:14:47,451
Uh, listen up. I need everyone
to get up and come with me.

329
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,236
Why? What's going on?

330
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,933
I'm sorry, ma'am. Someone will
explain everything shortly.

331
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,282
Right now I need you
to follow me.

332
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:59,289
Letting me go again?
This station's awesome!

333
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:00,943
We're going down to the bottom
of the parking garage.

334
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,205
Safety drill.

335
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,425
- Yeah. I don't want to do that.
- Tough.

336
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,863
Listen up. We are in lockdown.

337
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,517
Head to the underground garage,
bottom level.

338
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,866
This is not a drill.

339
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,650
We can't.
Evidence-room employees

340
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:14,565
aren't allowed to interact
with police personnel.

341
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,350
Well, then, stand in a corner
and don't talk to anyone,

342
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:18,221
but you can't stay here.

343
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,712
You okay?

344
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:32,409
I'm fine.

345
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:34,368
You're really putting a lot on
the line for this Feltt guy.

346
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:36,109
He must be pretty important
to you.

347
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:38,111
Why do you say
he was wrongly accused?

348
00:15:38,154 --> 00:15:40,069
I told you. You and I
are not gonna be friends.

349
00:15:40,113 --> 00:15:41,897
I'm just trying to
make the best of this.

350
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,813
Well, stop.

351
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:47,903
That a chemo port
on your chest there?

352
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,167
My aunt had one. Colon cancer.

353
00:15:51,211 --> 00:15:52,952
Pancreatic.

354
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:56,129
I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

355
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:59,132
Means I got
nothing left to lose.

356
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:02,222
So, what, you're dying,
and you want your last act

357
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:05,007
to be murdering hundreds
of innocent people?

358
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,617
Well, they only die
if your sergeant

359
00:16:06,661 --> 00:16:09,098
doesn't hold up
his end of the deal.

360
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,013
See, it's a matter
of perspective.

361
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:12,841
Then help me see your side.

362
00:16:12,884 --> 00:16:14,625
I told you. You and I are
not gonna be friends,

363
00:16:14,669 --> 00:16:15,975
so shut the hell up.

364
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,669
I'm sorry. I cannot be in here.
I get claustrophobic!

365
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:02,064
I understand, but this is
the safest place for you to be.

366
00:17:02,108 --> 00:17:04,719
Yeah, until the bomb goes off
and the whole structure
collapses on us.

367
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,764
Hey. Okay.
That is not gonna happen.

368
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:09,419
This place was designed to be
a bomb and earthquake shelter.

369
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:10,638
Okay? Just take a breath.

370
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:12,901
Ugh. Of this stale-ass air?

371
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,685
Do you have any idea
the long-term health effects

372
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,861
of breathing carbon monoxide?

373
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:19,081
No, but I bet it's
a hell of a lot better
than getting blown up.

374
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,910
- And where are <i>you</i> going?
- Back to work.

375
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,390
While we're stuck
in the station,

376
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,653
Jackson is out there with Doug
with no backup.

377
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:27,220
Did something happen?
- Well, not yet.

378
00:17:27,263 --> 00:17:29,526
I mean, Jackson feels like
he sold his apology to Doug,

379
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,050
but I don't trust it.

380
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,921
I don't, either. Tell Jackson
to keep his head down today

381
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:34,792
since we can't be there for him.

382
00:17:34,836 --> 00:17:37,447
We're gonna stay right here.

383
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,235
Big Mike. What do you got?

384
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:44,411
Hostage barricade
with a mobile WMD.

385
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:45,629
Who's the hostage?

386
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:47,370
The trouble magnet.
That old rookie.

387
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:48,806
-Nolan? That's the one.

388
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,244
This is my boot, Jackson West.
He's interested in SWAT.

389
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,680
Well, if there's still
a Mid-Wilshire tomorrow,
hit me up.

390
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,160
Any friend of Dougie's.

391
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:56,031
Snipers, spotters.
You got your assignments.

392
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,424
- Let's move out.
- Let's go.

393
00:17:57,467 --> 00:18:00,166
-What should we do?
Support SWAT?
-Negative.

394
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:02,168
We're the only patrol unit
left outside the building.

395
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:04,083
Now every thug, lowlife,
and banger in the city's

396
00:18:04,126 --> 00:18:05,736
gonna know we're
vulnerable right now.

397
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,042
We got to get back out there,

398
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,652
show them you can't mess
with the LAPD.

399
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:28,803
Hey!

400
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:31,893
Hey. Hey! Wake up!

401
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:35,897
Hey! Hey! Geez. Wake up!

402
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:43,557
Wake up! Hey! Don't let go!
Wake up! Wake up!

403
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:49,563
Come on! Don't let go!
Wake up! Get up!

404
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,741
What happened? What happened?

405
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:55,264
Keep a grip on it.
Tighten your grip.
Tighten your grip!

406
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,179
- Tighten it!
- I got it. I got it! I got it!

407
00:18:57,223 --> 00:18:58,180
Yeah. You passed out.
- I've got it!

408
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,964
You passed out!

409
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:02,271
-You almost killed everyone.

410
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:04,926
My blood pressure must've
bottomed out.

411
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:07,233
It happens sometimes.

412
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,887
Well, given that fun fact,
how about we disconnect

413
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,193
the dead man's switch?

414
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:15,850
It's not happening.

415
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:18,461
I'm fine.

416
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:43,225
Sergeant? You seeing this?

417
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:44,879
Van, rear window.

418
00:19:44,922 --> 00:19:46,228
Got it.

419
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:49,231
Is that...

420
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:50,580
Morse code.

421
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,016
I'll look up a dictionary.

422
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,322
Hold on. Hold on.

423
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:00,634
- S-C-R -- is that "scar"?
- Left eye.

424
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:02,244
Suspect has a scar
on his left eye.

425
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:04,942
- Good man, Nolan.
- Okay. So if we assume
our bomber

426
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:06,640
did time at Primedale
with Feltt,

427
00:20:06,683 --> 00:20:09,556
we know that he's a white male
with a scar on his left eye...

428
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,602
-Graham Porter.

429
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:14,430
Uh, he did three years
at Primedale,

430
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:16,389
and before that
a string of misdemeanors.

431
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,434
But nothing that screams out
"mad bomber."

432
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:20,654
How does a guy like this hook up
with a lifer like Feltt?

433
00:20:20,697 --> 00:20:22,612
Let's hope Lopez can find out.

434
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,266
Donald Feltt came to us
nine years ago

435
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,225
for a murder that would have
made Dahmer blush.

436
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,096
Any friends? Known associates?

437
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:30,054
Inmates like Feltt
don't have friends.

438
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:33,275
What about Graham Porter?
A former inmate of yours.

439
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,059
Doesn't ring a bell.

440
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:39,716
- Huh.
- What?

441
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,893
Well, he was in our level one
minimum-security unit.

442
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:45,374
Those inmates never cross paths
with guys in the SHU.

443
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:50,379
Then why is Graham risking
his life to save Feltt?

444
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:51,685
Unless...

445
00:20:51,728 --> 00:20:52,903
Unless what?

446
00:20:52,947 --> 00:20:55,254
This isn't about Feltt at all.

447
00:20:55,297 --> 00:20:57,125
I need to know what happened to
Graham after he left prison.

448
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,307
You have been glued
to your phone.

449
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:08,354
-Who you texting?
None of your business.

450
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:10,791
Someone you care about?

451
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,140
Someone you're
saying goodbye to?

452
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:17,580
You know,
everyone in that station

453
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:21,541
has someone they care about,
someone who loves them,

454
00:21:21,584 --> 00:21:24,326
someone who's worried they won't
ever see them alive again.

455
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,591
Yeah. Well, we all got to die
someday, don't we, Officer?

456
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:31,725
Today's as good a day
as any other.

457
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:37,470
Time for a shot across the bow.

458
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:39,123
Control, 7-Adam-07.

459
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,343
Show us on West Adams and 14th.

460
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,606
-Code 6. What are we doing here?

461
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,695
Sending a message.

462
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,523
We want them to let all their
little homies know that

463
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:50,787
even though we're wounded,
we're not down.

464
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:52,746
But they don't
look like much to me.

465
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,748
Well, looks can be deceiving.

466
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:57,533
Especially on a day like
this, we can't show
any signs of weakness.

467
00:21:57,577 --> 00:21:59,274
Got to hit the bully
before they hit you.

468
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,146
Hey!
Fingers on the fender, boys.

469
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:06,150
Why?
We're not doing anything wrong.

470
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:08,327
Can't work on cars in
the street, ese.

471
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,894
- Fingers on the hood.
- We're not doing repairs, ese.

472
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:12,156
I'm just showing them
the engine.

473
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,028
Hands on the hood now.

474
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:15,682
Screw that. You got no cause.

475
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:17,771
What are you,
some kind of lawyer?

476
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,163
Pre-law at SMC, actually.

477
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:21,252
Are you threatening me?

478
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,169
You know what happens when you
threaten a badge?

479
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:26,606
-Doug.

480
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,390
Officer West, I thought you had
my six.

481
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:29,739
-I do. Then watch those two

482
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,785
while I deal with
Mr. Lawyer here.

483
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:36,267
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop.

484
00:22:36,311 --> 00:22:38,748
Look, you three, back in your
car, have a nice day.

485
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:40,228
Sorry for the trouble.

486
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:50,717
You're done, Boot -- what you
just did is a fireable offense.

487
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,066
I'm going straight
to the city manager.

488
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:54,242
I don't care if your daddy
works for I.A.

489
00:22:54,285 --> 00:22:57,158
He's not gonna be able
to save you now.

490
00:22:57,201 --> 00:23:00,117
You know what, dumbass?

491
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:03,294
My daddy,
he doesn't work for I.A.

492
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:04,687
He runs it.

493
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:07,255
So if you're coming for my job,
he'll come for yours.

494
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:11,738
You know, I-I'm done tiptoeing
around your racist ass.

495
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:13,870
You're a dead man walking.

496
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:15,829
<i>7-Adam-07. Status check.</i>

497
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:17,439
<i>Are you Code 4 on your stop?</i>

498
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:24,185
Yeah. All good.

499
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,067
How long did Graham
Porter live in your halfway house?

500
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:39,505
Almost three months.
Is he in trouble?

501
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,942
- You could say that.
- Doesn't surprise me.

502
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:44,031
Graham's the unluckiest man
alive.

503
00:23:44,074 --> 00:23:46,425
Gets out of prison determined
to get his life on track.

504
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,514
Finds a job, falls in love,

505
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:51,299
then he gets hit with
Stage 4 cancer.

506
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:52,518
That's rough.

507
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:55,085
He has no money
for doctors, no insurance.

508
00:23:55,129 --> 00:23:57,131
He started one of those
YouFundMe things,

509
00:23:57,174 --> 00:24:01,440
but it barely covered
his first round of chemo.

510
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,443
Last I heard, he was in danger
of ending up on the street.

511
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,446
So, Graham Porter is in
desperate need of money.

512
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:08,838
-So why not demand a ransom?

513
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,274
Why give us the head fake
on Feltt?

514
00:24:10,318 --> 00:24:11,537
Well, maybe it's not
a head fake.

515
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,625
Maybe Feltt's paying Graham

516
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:14,235
to bust him out of prison.

517
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:15,845
No, Feltt's a murderer,
not a narco

518
00:24:15,889 --> 00:24:17,934
with unlimited cash flow --
if this Feltt gambit is smoke,

519
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:19,370
we're chasing our tails trying
to free him.

520
00:24:19,414 --> 00:24:21,416
Meanwhile, an accomplice robs
a bank or something.

521
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,853
Hollywood division did evacuate
the area around the station.

522
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:27,161
It's standard procedure,
and Graham would know that.

523
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:29,424
Bradford, Chen, make a list of
every high-value target

524
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,427
around here -- cash businesses,
high-end shopping...

525
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,255
There's a check-cashing place
two blocks south of here.

526
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:36,083
Contact Stanton and West.
Have them check it out.

527
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,693
I'm gonna call the chief, see if
we can get some extra units

528
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:38,955
around here to help out.

529
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:43,394
Look, I know we both
got heated back there,

530
00:24:43,438 --> 00:24:44,483
said things we didn't mean --

531
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:45,919
I meant what I said.

532
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:51,098
Listen, I got a wife, two kids.

533
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:53,361
Everybody
you jacked up for no reason

534
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:56,538
has a family --
it didn't stop you.

535
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:00,411
The storefront looks empty,

536
00:25:00,455 --> 00:25:03,545
but I'll check the doors.

537
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,161
Jackson says everything is
Code 4

538
00:25:11,205 --> 00:25:13,468
at the check-cashing place,
there's no sign of trouble.

539
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,775
Not at any of the other
high-value targets, either.

540
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:17,124
Maybe we're going down
the wrong path.

541
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,342
Maybe this is not
about money at all.

542
00:25:18,386 --> 00:25:19,605
What the hell is it about?

543
00:25:19,648 --> 00:25:21,215
Uh, we did some digging
into Graham.

544
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,739
His YouFundMe was set up by
his girlfriend, Kelsey Adams.

545
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:25,262
- Have Lopez run her down.
- We did,

546
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:26,916
but there's no one home
at her apartment.

547
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,049
- But there's something weird.
- This whole thing is weird.

548
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:30,877
Kelsey is using
an assumed identity.

549
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,270
We ran her through the system.
Social Security number's a fake.

550
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:34,576
We can't find
a driver's license for her.

551
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,751
-So we don't have a picture.
No, sir.

552
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,361
But according to Lopez,
Kelsey and Graham

553
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:39,450
have been inseparable
since they first met.

554
00:25:39,494 --> 00:25:41,452
So it's likely she's involved
in this somehow.

555
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,977
Yeah, but how if it's
not about money or Feltt?

556
00:25:47,241 --> 00:25:48,808
What if this is all
a distraction meant to pull

557
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:50,940
our focus outside the station,

558
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:53,290
when we should be focused
inside?

559
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:55,945
What kind of woman would be
crazy enough to be in a building

560
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,730
with her boyfriend
parked outside in a truck

561
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:59,775
full of explosives?

562
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:02,604
The kind that would get herself
arrested twice in one hour.

563
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:03,997
Freegan Frida.

564
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,302
-Hey, what's going on?

565
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:06,608
We're just trapped in here.
Is it over yet?

566
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:08,436
-Uh, not yet. Chen.

567
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:11,874
Dude, please tell me you brought
snacks. I'm starving.

568
00:26:11,918 --> 00:26:14,007
- It's over, Kelsey.
- Who's Kelsey?

569
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,661
You got yourself arrested
this morning,

570
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:17,314
but we let you go too quickly.

571
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:19,360
That's why you had to break that
window to get yourself back in.

572
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:21,231
So you'd be in the station when
Graham made his demands.

573
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:22,885
Only we put you down here,
and you can't get

574
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:24,147
back in the station
without a key card.

575
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:26,585
The only question left is why?

576
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:29,544
What's so important
in the station?

577
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,981
Dude, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

578
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:34,244
But I'm super intrigued.

579
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,685
Kelsey Adams!

580
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:41,643
Stop her!

581
00:26:41,687 --> 00:26:43,471
-♪ Baby, I'm all yours
-Hey! Excuse me.

582
00:26:43,514 --> 00:26:46,126
- Excuse me!
- ♪ You got the rhythm

583
00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:48,694
♪ And that God you love
is not mine, no ♪

584
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,132
She must've broken it.

585
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:54,308
Come on.
Who have you been texting?

586
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:57,050
I mean, clearly, it's your
accomplice, but has to be

587
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:59,487
someone important to you for you
to risk your life like this.

588
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,706
-Can't be a friend. No.

589
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:03,665
This scheme is too dangerous.

590
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:05,275
Slim chance of escape.

591
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:09,932
Maybe family?

592
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:12,587
A brother perhaps? Sister?

593
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,937
- How about a girlfriend?
- I don't know what you're
talking about, all right?

594
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:16,722
Girlfriend it is. Okay.

595
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:20,160
I understand the hesitation --
you don't want her ID'd.

596
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:22,466
That's a good thing, actually.

597
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,381
It means you think you'll
get away with this.

598
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:27,515
No, I don't.

599
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:29,473
But you think she will.

600
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,016
Sergeant, this is Harper --
Evidence room door

601
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:51,844
has been breached,
I'm starting a search.

602
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,381
Don't move.

603
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:08,730
Please, I have to find it!

604
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,297
Find what?!

605
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,691
He thinks I'm dead.
If they run my prints...

606
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:13,996
Are you trying to
destroy evidence

607
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,042
- from a crime you committed?
- No!

608
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:18,000
If he finds me, he will kill me.

609
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:20,742
Who?

610
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:24,703
My husband.
He's a loan shark in El Paso.

611
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:27,749
He beat me up on the regular.

612
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,708
So I ran away three years ago.

613
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:32,754
I paid for a new identity --
birth certificate, the works --

614
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:34,582
just so he would never find me.

615
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,497
But last week, there was
a robbery in the restaurant

616
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,281
where I work.

617
00:28:38,325 --> 00:28:40,588
The cops took a bunch of
stuff into evidence,

618
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,633
- things that I had touched.
- And when they pull the prints,

619
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:44,984
they will get a hit
on the real you.

620
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:48,814
And he'll find me,
and he will kill me.

621
00:28:48,857 --> 00:28:52,687
Why go through all this?
Why not just call the cops?

622
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,689
He's got cops on his payroll.

623
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,691
They reported me missing.

624
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,259
The minute my prints show up
in the system, they'll know,

625
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:00,782
and they'll tell him
where to find me.

626
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:09,356
Please...

627
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:11,140
do not let him find me.

628
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:19,932
All right.
I will try and help you.

629
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:21,629
But right now, you have
got to do the right thing,

630
00:29:21,672 --> 00:29:24,240
and you have to tell
Graham to stand down.

631
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:29,637
<i>Graham Porter. You there?</i>

632
00:29:35,991 --> 00:29:38,298
-How do you know my name?
<i>I know everything.</i>

633
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:41,127
I know this whole thing's about
trying to protect Kelsey.

634
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,520
She's here in custody.

635
00:29:43,564 --> 00:29:46,045
Release her. Do it now.

636
00:29:46,088 --> 00:29:48,221
<i>I can't do that,
but I'll make you a deal.</i>

637
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:49,962
No!

638
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,093
<i>You set her free right now,</i>

639
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:53,269
or I blow this bomb
and we all die.

640
00:29:53,313 --> 00:29:55,097
Graham, she told us the truth.

641
00:29:55,141 --> 00:29:59,145
<i>The bomb is a fake. It's over.</i>

642
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:03,105
You're under arrest.

643
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:05,499
No.

644
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:07,762
No, I'm not.

645
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:14,377
Guys, get locked in.
We're going in five.

646
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:18,207
Tell your SWAT to back off
or I shoot your officer.

647
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:19,643
Do it now!

648
00:30:19,687 --> 00:30:23,256
<i>Okay, okay, just hold on.</i>

649
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:25,214
Graham, this has to stop.

650
00:30:25,258 --> 00:30:26,868
You can barely stand.

651
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,482
I can still pull a trigger.

652
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,094
You're not gonna shoot me.

653
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,356
You think I care about
going back to prison?

654
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:42,014
At least there my chemo
would be paid for,

655
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:44,799
instead of being left to
rot from the inside out.

656
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,193
That may be true,

657
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:50,370
but you wouldn't just be
condemning yourself to prison.

658
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:53,329
You'd be condemning Kelsey, too.

659
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:57,725
If you kill me, she becomes
an accomplice to murder.

660
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,335
That's a life sentence.

661
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:01,250
For you, that might
not be very long.

662
00:31:01,294 --> 00:31:02,861
But for Kelsey...

663
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,253
I just wanted to do
something good

664
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,560
before I died, that's it.

665
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:08,867
She deserves to be happy.

666
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,346
I know.

667
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,304
Right.

668
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:13,523
So, help her.

669
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:17,223
You -- Promise to
talk to the DA,

670
00:31:17,266 --> 00:31:20,835
pull some strings, something.

671
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,707
Graham, if I promised
you that, I'd be lying.

672
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:26,014
I don't have any power.

673
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:29,191
I'm just a rookie.
No one's gonna listen to me.

674
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:32,194
Her fate's in your hands now.

675
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,336
I -- I c--

676
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:58,438
Sergeant Grey,
this is Officer Nolan.

677
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:00,875
One in custody.

678
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,224
We're Code 4.

679
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,454
<i>Units -- information only.</i>

680
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:16,891
<i>The hostage barricade
at Mid-Wilshire is Code 4.</i>

681
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,545
<i>Processing is open. No injuries.</i>

682
00:32:18,588 --> 00:32:21,504
<i>-Complete Code 4.

683
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:24,029
You know, back in the day,
when something good like this

684
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:27,336
