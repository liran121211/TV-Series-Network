1
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:03,655
Last day of training.

2
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:05,048
Last day of Tim barking orders.

3
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:07,268
Last day that they can fire us
at a moment's notice.

4
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:10,358
Last day of them recording
every flaw for posterity.

5
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:12,012
It's kind of bittersweet.

6
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:13,361
Nope. Just sweet.

7
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,058
Sorry. Sorry.

8
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:16,581
Guys, stop apologizing.

9
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,670
You guys have finally made it,

10
00:00:18,714 --> 00:00:19,671
and I will be right behind you.

11
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:21,108
Look, the extra month
will fly by.

12
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:22,370
You know it.

13
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,589
Now, is Tim gonna do
anything special

14
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,896
to memorialize
your last shift together?

15
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,071
Not knowingly.

16
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,072
You know, when you move on

17
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:31,031
from an important relationship,

18
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:34,860
there are steps you should take
to ensure a healthy parting.

19
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:37,602
We are going to work through
every single one of them.

20
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:39,517
Uh, how, if he doesn't know
you're doing it?

21
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:41,476
Trickery. Bye.

22
00:00:41,519 --> 00:00:44,087
That's... Yeah.

23
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:45,175
Who are <i>you</i> gonna ride with
today?

24
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,611
No idea.

25
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:48,961
Grey's busy, and Smitty's
getting a back tattoo.

26
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,789
That's -- Yeah. Don't ask.

27
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,922
So, we are out of TOs,
and I'm guessing

28
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:54,489
I'm finishing my rookie year
at the front desk.

29
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,664
Huh. Boot.

30
00:00:57,927 --> 00:00:59,102
Where's our gear?

31
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:01,148
Wait, what?

32
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:03,019
We started this journey
together.

33
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,325
I think we should end it
that way.

34
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:05,587
Don't you?

35
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,588
Yeah.

36
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,155
Then let's go.

37
00:01:12,115 --> 00:01:13,421
I thought we were tight.

38
00:01:13,464 --> 00:01:14,509
You did?

39
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:15,553
Um, we are.

40
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:17,468
That's -- I mean, why? What?

41
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,122
You told your ethics professor

42
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,732
she should come for
a ride along?

43
00:01:20,776 --> 00:01:21,733
No.

44
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:22,778
Mm. We -- No.

45
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:24,214
We didn't even, uh, discuss it,

46
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:25,868
but I-I need to pass this class,

47
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:29,045
so it's super important
she doesn't get shot today.

48
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,394
No promises.

49
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:31,961
You ride with me, you ride
the roller coaster.

50
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:33,528
Okay, Nyla, I know that --

51
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:35,312
- Hi. Good morning.
- Good morning.

52
00:01:35,356 --> 00:01:37,401
Uh, Professor Ryan, this is
Detective Nyla Harper,

53
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:38,620
my training officer.

54
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:39,621
I'm told you're gonna be going

55
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:41,013
on a ride along with us today.

56
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:42,711
I hope that's okay.

57
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:45,017
I didn't want to put you in an
awkward position by asking you,

58
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:46,932
but your watch commander said
that you'd feel cheated

59
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,238
if I didn't ride with you, so...

60
00:01:48,282 --> 00:01:50,066
And he was right.

61
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,155
- Uh, shall we?
- Mm.

62
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,331
Okay.

63
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,159
So, you, uh,
sign all the paperwork

64
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:57,508
that says that we are not liable

65
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,293
if you are maimed or killed?

66
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:00,946
I did. It seemed
a bit excessive.

67
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,339
Mm. No, it's not.

68
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,167
I mean, we will try our best
to protect you,

69
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,952
but we cannot guarantee
your safety.

70
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:10,173
You will be exposed to all
the same dangers that we are.

71
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:13,611
Well, more farmers die yearly
than cops do.

72
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:15,091
I didn't have to sign
a liability waiver

73
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,527
to go apple picking.

74
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,094
That's because you weren't
picking them

75
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,139
out of a wood chipper.

76
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:20,401
Uh, hey,

77
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:21,924
have you ever seen
a body camera up close?

78
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:23,055
No.

79
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,405
Well, they're always running,

80
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:26,537
uh, until we actually need them.

81
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:27,886
We switch them on,
then they start recording,

82
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,279
and they go back two minutes

83
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:30,672
so we can catch any of that
last-minute action.

84
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,804
Oh, yet they're always broken

85
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,850
whenever the cops
cross the line.

86
00:02:34,893 --> 00:02:36,895
You'd be surprised
how many police officers

87
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:39,028
actually <i>want a body camera.</i>

88
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:40,334
Oh. That way,

89
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,205
it makes it easier to
disprove complaints.

90
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:44,773
Okay, then you will not mind

91
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:47,297
if I record
the ride along myself --

92
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,298
as research tool.

93
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,169
No problem.

94
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:53,912
Just as long as you turn it off

95
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:56,437
when we hit the strip club
for the lunch buffet.

96
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,528
She's kidding.

97
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,704
That buffet is terrible
at that strip club.

98
00:03:02,747 --> 00:03:04,314
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh Ready to go?

99
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,447
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

100
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,234
♪ I'm gonna win for you
like I know you want me to do ♪

101
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,976
You got yours on? Yeah.

102
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,630
Alright.

103
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:17,240
It's our last shift together.

104
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,459
It's crazy, huh?

105
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:19,982
Not really.

106
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,331
Come on.

107
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,593
I mean, we've been
riding shoulder to shoulder

108
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,116
for over a year now.

109
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,075
And soon, there'll be a new
rookie sitting in that seat,

110
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:28,643
annoying the crap out of me
for 12 hours a day.

111
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:31,559
So, you're not gonna
miss riding with me at all?

112
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:33,256
It's a job, not happy hour.

113
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,563
Mm. Denial. Check.

114
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:38,130
What? Hmm?

115
00:03:38,174 --> 00:03:39,262
Nothing.

116
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:49,664
So, you teach full time?

117
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:52,188
No. Just nights and weekends.

118
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,756
My day job is
civil rights litigation.

119
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,584
And then there's lecturing,
the writing,

120
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:57,933
the cable news hits.

121
00:03:57,976 --> 00:03:58,934
When do you sleep?

122
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:00,457
Sleep? What's that?

123
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:02,242
Oh, is that what you were doing
in my class on Monday?

124
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:04,156
What?

125
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,201
No. Uh, no.

126
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,289
Sometimes, I just --
I hold a blink

127
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,117
for a really long time.

128
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,858
You sure lying to your teacher
is the way to go here?

129
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:10,989
Actually, now that
I hear it out loud,

130
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,164
I'd like to revise my answer.

131
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:14,036
Yeah. Uh-huh.

132
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,038
So, uh, given how busy you are,

133
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:18,214
why take the time
for a ride along?

134
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,217
Well, I'm finishing up a book
on the future of policing.

135
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,176
Hey, what would you say is
the, uh, biggest challenge

136
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,483
you face day to day?

137
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:28,616
Finding a safe bathroom.

138
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:30,095
Uh, that is -- that is true.

139
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:32,359
I mean, we can't use a
stall bathroom for safety reasons.

140
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:34,099
The door has to go
floor to ceiling.

141
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:36,145
And the location of
the bathroom, also very important,

142
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:38,321
so that not a lot of people can
see us entering and leaving.

143
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:40,976
<i>7-Adam-15,</i>

144
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,109
<i>residential burglary alarm,
1330 Monrovia.</i>

145
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:46,111
Hundred bucks it's
an accidental trigger.

146
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:47,461
That is a hard pass.

147
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,376
She's -- She's kidding.

148
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,116
No. No way we'd blow off
a service call.

149
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:53,858
Copy. Responding.

150
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,426
Do you see yourself
as my mentor?

151
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:59,690
No. I'm your TO.

152
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:02,214
It's my job to make sure you're
not dangerously incompetent

153
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:05,087
when you hit the streets
without supervision tomorrow.

154
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,262
You know, when I was a rookie,

155
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,350
I couldn't wait
to get off probation.

156
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,178
Oh, I am excited.

157
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:10,832
Believe me.

158
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:14,096
But I also know the importance of
acknowledging your loss

159
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,185
when going through something like this.

160
00:05:16,228 --> 00:05:17,491
"Acknowledging your loss"?

161
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:18,970
Hmm.

162
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:21,451
What is this, some
"Intro to Psych" closure BS?

163
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:23,279
It's not BS.

164
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,237
It's a widely used
psychological model

165
00:05:25,281 --> 00:05:27,805
to help people cope
with the end of a relationship.

166
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,329
Relationship?

167
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,548
Partnership. Mentorship.

168
00:05:31,592 --> 00:05:32,767
Whatever you want to call it.

169
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,246
Look, I don't want to
call it anything.

170
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:36,074
It's not like you won't see me
tomorrow at the station.

171
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:37,859
You know, what's there
to talk about?

172
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,339
A lot.

173
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,253
I have a list.

174
00:05:41,297 --> 00:05:42,603
So... A list?

175
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,608
You know, littering is a $250 fine.

176
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:50,001
Worth it.

177
00:05:50,045 --> 00:05:51,394
What are you smiling about?

178
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:54,397
Well, we were at denial,

179
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:57,444
but now we have moved to anger.

180
00:05:57,487 --> 00:05:58,880
That's more progress.

181
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:04,189
Thank you.

Gets me out of the office.

183
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,238
I mean, not just for today.

184
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:10,631
I mean, you could have
bounced me from the program

185
00:06:10,674 --> 00:06:12,807
after that first day.

186
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:14,243
I owe you my career.

00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,422

What?

193
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,298
You're gonna be a mom.

And?

195
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,912
I don't know. I mean...

196
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:34,002
a lot's happened since
we started out together.

197
00:06:34,045 --> 00:06:36,134
I knew my TO would be
important to my career,

198
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:38,441
but ...don't know.

199
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,138
I didn't realize how important
you'd be to my life.

00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:48,799
Have you read my work?

203
00:06:49,974 --> 00:06:51,454
I have.

204
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:52,977
I actually follow you
on social media.

205
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,979
Oh. And?

206
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:58,069
I'd make a lot of the reforms
you're pushing for,

207
00:06:58,113 --> 00:07:00,332
but some just aren't
based in reality.

208
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:02,726
Well, maybe not your reality.

209
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,685
Look, either you want
my opinion or you don't.

210
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,470
If you are just here to confirm
your own point of view,

211
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:08,819
then I-I will stop engaging.

212
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:10,168
No, no, no, no.
That's not what I'm looking for.

213
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:12,475
I-I'm just used to cops taking my head off

215
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:15,957
So...
Well, you would be
surprised

216
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,089
how many cops actually know
the system has to change,

217
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,004
but just feel powerless
to make it happen.

218
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:21,441
Hmm.

219

222
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:29,187
So, you two getting along? Huh?

223
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:30,232
My two teachers?

224
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:31,363
Mm. Yeah.

225
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:32,756
We're bonding
by making fun of you.

226
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,802
- Oh. Outstanding.
- Let me get in on that.

227
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:35,585

how much I've been

228

00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:40,851
Child abduction.

230
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:42,940
Suspect is driving a gold Tacoma truck.

00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:47,162

Victim was kidnapped from...

234
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:49,730
City of Angels Hospital.

235
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,209
How old?

236
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:53,385
Uh... five hours.

237
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,434
Here we go.

238
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,571
Air Three is lifting now.

239
00:08:04,614 --> 00:08:05,746
I'm 10-9-7.

240
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:08,836
Searching for the suspect vehicle.

241
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,795
Uh, newborn baby girl went
missing 20 minutes ago.

242
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,971
The hospital is going
over the surveillance footage.

243
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:15,843
Wait, don't all babies
get LoJack these days?

244
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:18,106
Yeah, it was found
in the elevator, cut off.

245
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,760
Who owns the Tacoma?

246
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:22,240
Uh, that would be the
father -- Jared Young.

247
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,981
Looks like they're going through
a messy divorce.

248
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:26,244
He was visiting the
hospital earlier that day,

249
00:08:26,288 --> 00:08:27,768
but security had him leave.

250
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:29,247
There may have been some kind of threat.

251
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:31,032
So, what, he went back in
and he just took the baby?

252
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:32,903
Jared's got quite an
extensive criminal history here.

253
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:34,818
Lot of narcos --uh, narco possession,

254
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:37,125
possession to sell, under the influence.

255
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,822
Mm, just the guy you want
taking care of your newborn.

256
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:40,171
Well, we got the whole
city looking for him.

257
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:41,172
He won't get far.

258
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:43,566
So, this baby that the, uh,

259
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,089
whole city is mobilized
to find --

260
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,526
is she by any chance white?

261
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:49,529
We issue plenty of Amber Alerts

262
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,965
for children of color, as well.

263
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:53,707
Do you have a kid?

264
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,404
Daughter.

265
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:56,753
And, uh, you're sure
your daughter

266
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:58,581
would get the same attention
as his son?

267
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:01,105
From the media? No.

268
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:05,109
But out here, we --
we look just as hard.

269
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:06,850
Mrs. Young, this is Detective Lopez.

270
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,765
I'm out here searching for your baby.

271
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:09,984
<i>You have to find her.</i>

272
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:11,246
Yes, ma'am, we're doing everything we can,

273
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,726
but I need your help.

274
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,554
Is there any place your
husband might take her?

275
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:15,729
<i>He lives in Bell Gardens.</i>

276
00:09:15,772 --> 00:09:17,078
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,645
We have officers on the
way to his apartment now,

278
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:21,517
but if he's not there,
where would he be?

279
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,346
<i>Out buying drugs,
if he has any money.</i>

280
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:25,826
And if he's not?

281
00:09:25,869 --> 00:09:27,958
<i>Jared will do anything
to get a fix,</i>

282
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,526
<i>including selling our baby.</i>

283
00:09:34,225 --> 00:09:35,662
Gold pickup, two blocks up.

284
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:42,582
Negative. Texas plates.

285
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:45,193
Five hours old.

286
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:46,760
That poor mother must
be going out of her mind.

287
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:49,850
Let me guess --

288
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,329
you think if the parents
had properly

289
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:52,809
worked through their separation,

290
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:54,245
this whole thing
could have been avoided?

291
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:58,032
No. Mom needs to get as
far away from him as possible.

292
00:09:58,075 --> 00:10:00,338
But I do think that having easier access

293
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:01,775
to counseling and mental health resources

294
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:03,428
could prevent situations like this.

295
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:05,692
Sure. But most guys
still wouldn't go.

296
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,302
Yeah, because we stigmatize mental health,

297
00:10:07,345 --> 00:10:10,000
treat it as less
important than physical health.

298
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:11,828
It's ridiculous that they
teach sex ed in schools,

299
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:14,352
but not how to be
in a relationship.

300
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:15,919
I wish someone taught me
how to be in this one.

301
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,486
Oh, so we <i>are in a relationship.</i>

302
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,577
So, what's the focus of your book?

303
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,666
Uh, reinventing policing --

304
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,276
with a more limited mandate.

305
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,887
Amen to that.

306
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,019
You agree with taking
resources away from police?

307
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:31,674
If it lessens our load,
then yes, absolutely.

308
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:33,545
Yeah, we complain about it all the time.

309
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:35,765
Police have become the
catch-all for the city's problems.

310
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:40,335
We're expected to be cops,
uh, psychologists,

311
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:42,859
social workers, teachers,
mediators.

312
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,644
And they only train us
for one of those jobs.

313
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:46,689
Gold truck. Two cars ahead.

314
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,429
That's him.

315
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,562
Control, 7-Adam-15.

316
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,782
We have eyes on the
Amber Alert suspect vehicle.

317
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:55,176
Heading west on Pico,
passing Westlake.

318
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:58,222
7-Adam-19, inbound on
Olympic, passing Ardmore.

319
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:00,703
7-Adam-07, coming west
from Wilshire and Rimpau --

320
00:11:00,747 --> 00:11:02,139
moving to intercept
from the front.

321
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:04,315
- Air Three responding.
- Heading west from Bell Gardens.

322
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:06,840
ETA to your location --
approximately six minutes.

323
00:11:06,883 --> 00:11:08,755
Can you parallel suspect
until I get eyes on?

324
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:09,930
Affirmative.

325
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,192
Parallel?

326
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:12,802
Yeah, we follow on side streets
and alleyways.

327
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:16,545
Oh, so he doesn't spot you
and run?

328
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:18,025
Exactly. Last thing we want

329
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:19,722
is him speeding through
traffic with a baby in the car,

330
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:20,854
especially since there's no way

331
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,246
he's got an infant car seat in there.

332
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,639
No, we'll just wait
until we have enough units,

333
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,814
and then we'll box him in.

334
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,729
Intersection ahead.
We still have him?

335
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:28,122
Yeah, he's about half a car length ahead,

336
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,384
but he's speeding up.

337
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:30,951
He might've seen us
before we made our turn.

338
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:34,737
7-Adam-19, Maxwell and Pico.

339
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,521
West of target --waiting for him to pass.

340
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:42,702
- Suspect just went past.
- Speed -- 50 miles an hour.

341
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:43,877
We'll move to parallel
on the north.

342
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,095
Copy that.

343
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,401
Why not just set up a roadblock?

344
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:48,011
Roadblocks are considered a lethal measure.

345
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,012
Didn't know that.

346
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,187
Yeah, there's a strong chance

347
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:51,972
a desperate driver will ram a roadblock.

348
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:53,277
Clear!

349
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:54,757
We don't use them unless we
have no other choice.

350
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,063
- Come on, come on.
- Watch out, watch out!

351
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,413
I can't see around the truck.

352
00:11:58,456 --> 00:11:59,631
Move it! I got it.

353
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:00,807
- Move! Hey!
- I got it after this car.

354
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,983
- Hold on. There we go.
- Got it.

355
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,465
- Do you see him?
- No.

356
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,816
Well, maybe -- maybe he turned
around when we got stuck.

357
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:11,469
7-Adam-19, we've lost visual.

358
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:12,775
You got eyes on him?

359
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,734
- Negative.
- We haven't reacquired visual.

360
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:16,692
Where the hell is that airship?

361
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,825
Air Three is overhead.
Arriving on scene.

362
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,652
What's the suspect's 20?

363
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:22,654
We lost visual.
Pico, east of Maxwell.

364
00:12:22,698 --> 00:12:24,874
It's possible he turned off
and headed either north or south.

365
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:26,528
Copy that. We're gonna orbit.

366
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,100
Contact.

367
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:34,928
Suspect vehicle now heading
north on Livingston.

368
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,625
Repeat, north on Livingston.

369
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,322
Copy. On our way.

370
00:12:38,366 --> 00:12:40,672
Speed is approximately 65.

371
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:41,717
Looks like he's heading
for the freeway.

372
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:47,723
Hold on.

373
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,420
Suspect just sideswiped
another vehicle.

374
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:51,074
He's lost control.

375
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,817
Tell me that wasn't our guy.

376
00:12:54,861 --> 00:12:56,427
<i>He just TC'd into
a telephone pole.</i>

377
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,429
Can you see inside the truck?

378
00:12:58,473 --> 00:12:59,691
<i>Negative.</i>

379
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:12,661
Hands! Police!

380
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:16,926
Show me your hands!

381
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,145
Where is your daughter?

382
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:19,668
What?

383
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,452
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

384
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:27,110
No kid. There's no kid in here!

385
00:13:27,154 --> 00:13:28,285
There's no kid!

386
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:29,678
Your baby, where is she?

387
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,158
At the hospital with her mom.

388
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:32,246
Then why did you run?

389
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:33,813
Gun and drugs.

390
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:37,773
If he doesn't have
the baby, who does?

391
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:45,476
Never thought
I'd be disappointed

392
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,827
a meth-head <i>wasn't
taking care of a newborn.</i>

393
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,132
But I guess there's still
plenty of time

394
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:50,960
for him to mess up
this kid's childhood,

395
00:13:51,004 --> 00:13:52,135
once we get her back.

396
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,355
<i>If</i> we get her back.

397
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,750
You know, whenever you need
Halloween costumes

398
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:00,230
for Lopez Jr.,

399
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,711
my mom has dozens in storage.

400
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:05,583
I'm talking cop uniforms
for every age.

401
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,324
You never really wanted
to be anything else?

402
00:14:09,109 --> 00:14:11,459
Astronaut? Ninja?

403
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:12,852
Ninja astronaut?

404
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,637
I mean, that'd be cool,
but... mnh-mnh.

405
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,681
No.

406
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,945
I guess I just
wanted to be my dad.

407
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,077
It was like my way of
feeling close to him

408
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,122
when he wasn't around.

409
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:24,298
Was that a lot? Yeah.

410
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:26,866
I mean, he was a detective
when I was born,

411
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,259
trying to make a name
for himself.

412
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:31,087
Lot of long hours.

413
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,306
But you were close.

414
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:33,960
Yeah, eventually.

415
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:36,919
Mom was kind of on her own
until I was 12.

416
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:39,226
And that's when he moved up,
got more stable hours.

417
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:40,967
Mm.

418
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,144
I mean, I always loved him --

419
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:46,929
don't get me wrong --
even when he wasn't around.

420
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:50,063
I have a lot of
great memories, you know?

421
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:51,629
Of course.

422
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:54,458
You know, you and Wesley are
going to be awesome parents.

423
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:56,591
I know.

424
00:14:56,634 --> 00:14:58,201
It's just...

425
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,247
We both get so wrapped up
in our cases,

426
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,380
we barely make time
to have dinner together.

427
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:05,121
How are we supposed to make time for a kid?

428
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:08,298
Wesley is loaded.
You get yourself a nanny.

429
00:15:08,342 --> 00:15:09,734
Or three.

430
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:11,040
So a stranger
can raise my child?

431
00:15:11,084 --> 00:15:12,302
I mean, it won't be a stranger

432
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,870
when you get to know them,
you know?

433
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,046
Look, you are not
the first detective

434
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,179
to have to balance work
with a kid.

435
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:20,571
Talk to Harper
about how she did it.

436
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:25,098
<i>Harper, can you ten-three
to a backup channel?</i>

437
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,406
Sure, go to 11.
Don't record this.

438
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,847
I need you to give
me the reals on something.

439
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:37,153
How difficult was it
to go back to work

440
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:38,589
after Lila was born?

441
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:41,157
Honestly, I barely remember.

442
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:42,942
I almost died
giving birth, so...

443
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:46,902
But, uh, that's -- that's not
gonna happen to you.

444
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:51,037
G-Giving birth can be
a wonderful experience,

445
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,343
I've been told.

446
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:54,562
Definitely get the epidural.

447
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:56,912
Don't worry. I'm not a lunatic.

448
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,219
I'm thinking of scheduling
a C, but I'm worried

449
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:00,611
that the stitches and everything

450
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:03,136
will keep me off work even longer.

451
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:05,007
I worried about the same
thing, but you know what?

452
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,269
I got stitches anyway --

453
00:16:06,313 --> 00:16:08,097
just not in my stomach.

454
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:09,751
Okay. Change us back
to channel one.

455
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:11,666
Wh-- I-I-- I think I want to hear this.

456
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,799
Tell me the truth --

457
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:16,671
Am I gonna poop myself?

458
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:18,368
And I'm out.

459
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:19,500
Wow.

460
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:22,242
I wish I could say no.

461
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:24,157
Why can't we just do
that twilight sleep thing

462
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,593
they did back in the '50s?

463
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,029
I asked.

464
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:29,858
Apparently it is
"grossly unethical."

465
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,556
<i>Detectives, are you done?</i>

466
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,557
Yes, sir.

467
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:41,739
We must seem callous,
joking while a kid is missing.

468
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,045
No, I get it. I'm sure it's hard

469
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,091
to work these kinds of cases.

470
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:46,831
Calls involving kids are the worst.

471
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,181
You can't help but think,
what if they were mine?

472
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:49,269
Mm.

473
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:50,313
Yeah, I don't have kids,

474
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:52,359
but I feel the same way

475
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:54,578
every time another Black kid
gets shot by police.

476
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,585
Oh. Hospital sent the
video of the kidnapping.

477
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:04,719
You can't see her face.

478
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:07,896
That is just terrifying.

479
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,898
A stranger snatching your baby

480
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:11,073
when you're not thereto protect them.

481
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,379
Don't worry.

482
00:17:12,422 --> 00:17:14,076
I will personally
stand watch over your kid

483
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,208
until you leave the hospital.

484
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:16,774
You better.

485
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,428
Do they have an ID
on the kidnapper?

486
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:19,342
Not yet.

487
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:20,735
Listen to me.

488
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:23,694
We're gonna find her, alright?

489
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:25,174
And that baby's gonna be fine.

490
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:26,480
You'll see.

491
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:33,269
We don't have time for this.

492
00:17:33,313 --> 00:17:35,402
Every minute we waste
waiting for an ID on this woman

493
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:36,925
is a minute she could
be hurting this kid --

494
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:38,274
or worse.

495
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:39,275
Look, you need to
get your head right

496
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,233
in case this goes bad.

497
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,104
I'm squared away.

498
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:45,064
The fact that you just said that
means you're not.

499
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:48,067
Look, you've been lucky
on the job so far.

500
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,548
No. Alright.

501
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:54,508
I'm sorry. That --
That came out wrong.

502
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:55,900
You've been through Hell --

503
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:58,512
stuff that would've broken
a lot of veteran cops.

504
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:01,080
But a dead kid is different.

505
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:04,039
A dead kid changes you forever.

506
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:09,218
I really hope our last shift together

507
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:10,524
doesn't end with that.

508
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,222
Yeah. Me too.

509
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:16,530
Okay, so what's next
on your list?

510
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,276
Okay.

511
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,668
"Surround yourself with people

512
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:27,149
who support, value,
and energize you,"

513
00:18:27,193 --> 00:18:30,239
which... may have to wait until later.

514
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:32,850
Then, uh, "Reflect on
the lessons learned --

515
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:36,463
both the good and the bad
--and express gratitude."

516
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,944
Okay.

517
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:42,556
So, what have I taught you
that you're grateful for?

518
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,601
Um... hmm.

519
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:49,258
Not to second-guess myself.

520
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:51,304
Yeah, early on,

521
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:54,481
one look from you could
send me into a tailspin.

522
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:55,917
Plain Clothes Day. Mm-hmm.

523
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,962
But I've learned to trust my instincts,

524
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,704
even if they go against what you would do,

525
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,880
which will be crucial for undercover work.

526
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:06,797
You serious about being UC?

527
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:08,930
Yeah.

528
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,714
Why? Do you not think
I'm tough enough?

529
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:12,455
No, it's not about being tough.

530
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:14,718
I mean, look,
you're as tough as they come.

531
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:18,679
It's just you're... sensitive.

532
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,811
You are!

533
00:19:20,855 --> 00:19:22,770
Look what happened with Tamara.

534
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:26,034
You gave her your car,
for crying out loud.

535
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:27,340
And today --

536
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:30,081
today, this whole need
to relive the last year,

537
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:31,300
talk about our feelings.

538
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,694
I happen to think that caring about people,

539
00:19:33,737 --> 00:19:36,914
connecting with them, is
what makes me a good cop.

540
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,133
It does.

541
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,830
Just not a good UC.

542
00:19:39,874 --> 00:19:41,615
Look, to work undercover,

543
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:44,705
you have to be able to lie
to someone's face --

544
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:46,315
make them believe
you're their best friend

545
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,231
and then stab them in the back.

546
00:19:49,275 --> 00:19:51,277
I just don't think you have
that killer instinct.

547
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,151
Ouch.

548
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,457
I'm sorry.

549
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,198
But it's better you hear it now.

550
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:08,859
You're right.

551
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:11,253
And I appreciate your honesty.

552
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,863
You always tell me the truth,

553
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,083
no matter how painful it's gonna be,

554
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:17,259
and you deserve the same from me.

555
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:26,007
I've been struggling with being
honest with you all day.

556
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,054
I've been hiding behind this
stupid closure checklist,

557
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:32,100
trying to get up the
courage to tell you something.

558
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:35,321
Okay.

559
00:20:35,364 --> 00:20:36,409
What?

560
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:45,766
I have feelings for you.

561
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,686
Uh, like f--Look, we've
been through a lot this year.

562
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:57,125
I mean... you saved my life.

563
00:20:57,168 --> 00:20:59,519
And I didn't want to say anything before

564
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:02,565
because I didn't want
to put you in a weird position.

565
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:06,308
But now, I mean, I think...

566
00:21:06,352 --> 00:21:09,877
I think the reason why
you're so protective of me and --

567
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,966
and why you don't want
me to be an undercover cop

568
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,446
is because...

569
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,450
...because you have feelings for me, too.

570
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:21,758
Lucy, I --

571
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:24,761
No, listen, I-I know
it's complicated.

572
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,459
You're my TO.

573
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:28,461
You're responsible for me.

574
00:21:28,504 --> 00:21:33,030
I know that you would
never cross that line, but...

575
00:21:33,074 --> 00:21:38,122
starting tomorrow, I guess... you're not,

576
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,037
and I...

577
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:41,561
Uh -- Eh --

578
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,305
First of all...

579
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,307
I-I just, like --

580
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,092
Thank you.

581
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:54,443
Um... you're...

582
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:57,794
Look, Lucy,
I'm -- I'm flattered.

583
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:01,276
I am.

584
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,452
You're a great girl.

585
00:22:03,496 --> 00:22:05,149
Woman. Woman.

586
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:09,153
And I...

587
00:22:09,197 --> 00:22:10,546
Um...

588
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:13,897
Crap.

589
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:14,898
Listen.

590
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:21,470
Are you kidding me?!

591
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:23,429
I'm sorry!

592
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:24,386
Are you kidding me?

593
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,474
Wait, I'm sorry.

594
00:22:25,518 --> 00:22:26,301
Oh, you're sorry.

595
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,216
Wait. Just wait.

596
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:30,436
Lie to your face -- check.

597
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:32,263
Make you think I've fallen for you --

598
00:22:32,307 --> 00:22:33,743
double check.

599
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,702
Oh, and stab you in the back

600
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:37,268
when you think we're best friends --

601
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,748
triple check.

602
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:40,141
Look me in the face...

603
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:41,360
Nope. ...and tell me

604
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,579
you don't think I have the killer instinct

605
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,407
to do undercover work.

606
00:22:45,451 --> 00:22:47,061
Look me in my face.

607
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:05,079
It's weird now, isn't it?

608
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:06,428
Nope.

609
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:09,431
I was just making a point.

610
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,520
And you're undermining it
by feeling guilty.

611
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,007
You're out of your mind.

612
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,791
You want to try
the Camden Experiment

613
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:22,966
in Los Angeles?

614
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,446
I'm sorry. What's
the Camden Experiment?

615
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,579
Uh, fire all police officers,

616
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,232
make them reapply
for their jobs.

617
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:29,451
Oh, just that?

618
00:23:29,495 --> 00:23:31,801
Well, you're both good cops.

619
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,760
You'd be back on the force
in no time.

620
00:23:33,803 --> 00:23:36,893
But running new background checks
on every single officer,

621
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:39,200
most especially combing through
their social media posts --

622
00:23:39,243 --> 00:23:40,419
that'll get rid of
most of the problem.

623
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,551
We'd be coming back to
a gutted force.

624
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:45,293
I mean, you would be down 10%.

625
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:46,990
Maybe 20%.

626
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:49,819
But you would be coming back to
a <i>better</i> force.

627
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,168
And what about the kid
that goes missing

628
00:23:51,212 --> 00:23:52,474
the day we're all fired?

629
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:55,172
I mean, it wouldn't happen
overnight.

630
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:58,132
It would happen gradually,
in stages.

631
00:23:58,175 --> 00:24:02,484
But without major action,
things will <i>never</i> get better.

632
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,268
<i>7-Adam-15,</i>

633
00:24:04,312 --> 00:24:06,096
<i>we have a possible suspect ID
on the Amber Alert.</i>

634
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,447
<i>Last name Cissane,
first name Rita.</i>

635
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,579
<i>Suspect's husband called 911.</i>

636
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,494
<i>Make contact

637
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,540
<i>Address is being sent
to your box.</i>

638
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,542
Copy that. We got it.
On our way.

639
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:21,329
Yeah, if, uh --
i-if she reaches out,

640
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:24,898
um, please, please,
please, please call me.

641
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:27,466
Um... okay. Yeah, no.
I-I gotta go.

642
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:32,688
Mr. Cissane,
I'm Detective Harper.

643
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,342
This is Officer Nolan.

644
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:37,606
I understand that your wife,
Rita, was here with a baby?

645
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,652
Yeah, I-I don't --
I don't know where she is.

646
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:43,177
I-I tried calling
everyone that I know.

647
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,918
I-I tried to stop her
from leaving,

648
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:48,617
but she was holding that baby,
and it was... just so little.

649
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:51,402
I know. They can look
so fragile at that age.

650
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:52,839
Uh, tell us about your wife.

651
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:55,232
Is there anything that could
have precipitated this?

652
00:24:55,276 --> 00:24:58,105
You don't know?

653
00:24:58,148 --> 00:25:02,762
W-We lost our daughter, Casey,
this morning to SIDS.

654
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:05,765
Rita went into the nursery
to check on her,

655
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:09,290
and then I heard screaming,
so I ran in,

656
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:13,816
and she was so still...
s-so cold.

657
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:17,254
I am so sorry.
Sir, h-how old was she?

658
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:18,778
Two months.

659
00:25:18,821 --> 00:25:21,084
That's why your wife was
at the hospital today?

660
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:23,565
Yeah, we -- we raced Casey
to the Emergency Room,

661
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:25,741
hoping that they could do
something, but it was --

662
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:27,569
it was too late.

663
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:32,269
And then there was so many, uh,
questions and -- and forms.

664
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:36,535
It took me a while to realize
that, um, that Rita had left.

665
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:38,624
She wasn't answering her cell,
so I thought maybe s-she --

666
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:41,104
she came home,
but she wasn't here,

667
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,803
and then she just showed up
like nothing had happened,

668
00:25:43,846 --> 00:25:47,241
and she was just...
holding this little baby

669
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,852
and calling her Casey

670
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:51,201
and saying that everything had
been a big mistake.

671
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:53,856
Okay, uh, we're gonna
have to initiate

672
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,641
Child Death Protocol.

673
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,077
Treat the place
like a crime scene.

674
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,820
Notify Homicide,
the District Attorney, and CPS.

675
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,735
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
We didn't kill our daughter.

676
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:03,649
It was -- It was -- It was SIDS.

677
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,781
Yes, sir. I understand.

678
00:26:05,825 --> 00:26:08,001
I'm not saying that we believe
that you harmed your child,

679
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:09,959
but we do have protocols
we have to follow.

680
00:26:10,003 --> 00:26:12,048
Eh, sir, it's --
the hard fact is

681
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:13,876
what most people consider
to be SIDS

682
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,575
is actually accidental
suffocation

683
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:19,055
from soft bedding or a toy.

684
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:22,276
Uh, right now, we have to
focus on your wife.

685
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,147
Is there anywhere you think
she might have gone?

686
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:25,453
I don't know.

687
00:26:25,496 --> 00:26:26,846
I've reached out to everyone
I can think of,

688
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:29,413
but she's not really
herself right -- right now.

689
00:26:29,457 --> 00:26:31,459
Has she been depressed lately?

690
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,635
Yeah. I mean, she hasn't been
eating or sleeping.

691
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,420
The doctor said she had,
um ...D,

692
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:38,466
but Rita refused any help.

693
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,337
Uh, has she been drinking a lot?

694
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:41,817
- Any drugs or medication?
- No.

695
00:26:41,861 --> 00:26:44,211
No, the doctor prescribed
antidepressants,

696
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:46,648
but Rita wouldn't take them.
I'm just so scared that --

697
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,345
- Thank you, sir.
- Okay, thank you.

698
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:49,999
Please don't hurt her.

699
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:51,566
She's not herself right now.

700
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,437
You have to promise me that
you won't hurt her, please.

701
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:09,018
Updated Amber Alert.

702
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:11,281
New suspect vehicle is a green Ford Fiesta.

703
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:14,850
License plate 3-Paul-Charles-Ida-0-2-6.

704
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:16,983
Suspect is Rita Cissane.

705
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:20,073
31-year-old white female who
lost her baby to SIDS.

706
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:26,253
This case is all the
nightmares in my closet combined.

707
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:28,647
I know. Sorry.

708
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,823
How am I ever gonna let my kid
out of my sight?

709
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,825
With all the things we see on the job,

710
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:34,261
the -- the things I know about people --

711
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:37,046
Look, the things we see
are outliers.

712
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:40,267
Look, every day, we show up
on people's worst day.

713
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,443
We see the exception,
not the rule.

714
00:27:42,486 --> 00:27:45,098
I know that up here, but --

715
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:49,232
Look, whether the kid is with
you or Wesley or a nanny,

716
00:27:49,276 --> 00:27:50,843
they'll be fine, okay?

717
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,715
It's just so different from
the way I grew up.

718
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:55,978
Wesley was raised by a nanny.

719
00:27:56,022 --> 00:27:59,721
But when my mom went to
work, she put me in the back room,

720
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:02,855
and the other women would check in on me.

721
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:05,858
Can't exactly drop off Lopez
Jr.in Holding every morning.

722
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,381
I don't know.

723
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:09,252
Smitty is surprisingly maternal.

724
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:13,648
That is the most horrifying idea
I've ever heard...

725
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,737
and I want it to be a reality show so bad.

726
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:18,000
Right? I would watch
the hell out of that.

727
00:28:19,001 --> 00:28:21,525
Rita is negative on any
previous 5150 holds,

728
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:23,963
and there are no
registered firearms in her name.

729
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:25,312
If this woman's doctor couldn't
get through to her,

730
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:26,617
how will you?

731
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:27,749
I-I mean,
this woman is in crisis.

732
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,185
She needs a psychiatrist.

733
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:30,578
Yeah, but the baby needs a cop.

734
00:28:30,621 --> 00:28:32,754
The honest truth is we don't
have enough information

735
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:34,103
to know what we're dealing with.

736
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:35,714
But that's every call.

737
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:37,367
It's a constant struggle to
figure things out

738
00:28:37,411 --> 00:28:38,891
before it's too late.

739
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,373
Uh, 7-Adam-19,
go to channel nine.

740
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:45,941
Go for 7-Adam-19.

741
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:47,726
Did you study postpartum depression

742
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,118
in your psych major?

743
00:28:49,162 --> 00:28:53,514
Yeah. PPD is fairly common,
affects 1 in 8 new moms.

744
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:56,038
<i>In most cases, they feel tired,
alone, guilty.</i>

745
00:28:56,082 --> 00:28:57,692
Some feel a lack of
attachment and then guilt

746
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,998
for not feeling attached.

747
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:03,002
<i>Some are overwhelmed by paranoia --</i>

748
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:07,397
visions of horrible
things happening to their own child.

749
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:10,139
I see Rita turned down treatment.

750
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:12,489
<i>That tells me she's
probably dealing with shame,</i>

751
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:14,622
trying to cope alone, isolating.

752
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,189
Now add to that the trauma

753
00:29:16,232 --> 00:29:18,495
of finding her child unresponsive.

754
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,280
That could precipitate a mental break.

755
00:29:20,323 --> 00:29:22,543
If it's an extreme case
of PPD, which is rare,

756
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:25,328
she could be thinking
about harming herself or her baby.

757
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,634
Tim. Green Fiesta.

758
00:29:26,677 --> 00:29:27,809
Plates match. That's our car.

759
00:29:27,853 --> 00:29:28,810
Nolan, we found Rita's car.

760
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:31,508
21000 block of Manningham.

761
00:29:31,552 --> 00:29:33,641
On our way. Let's go.

762
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:39,603
Control, 7-Adam-19,

763
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:41,997
we've located the Fiesta from
the revised Amber Alert.

764
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,608
21000 block of Manningham.

765
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:46,610
No sign of suspect or child.</i>

766
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,441
It's still hot.
She must have just ditched it.

767
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,400
Hey. You looking for the driver?

768
00:29:53,443 --> 00:29:54,880
Yeah, you see where she went?

769
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:57,143
Nah. I was walking by
when she parked on the curb.

770
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:59,145
- How long ago?
- About five minutes.

771
00:29:59,188 --> 00:30:00,581
Enough time for Butch and I
to circle the block.

772
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:03,062
Did she have
a baby with her?
No idea.

773
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:05,629
I just watched her
totally demolish
that parking spot.

774
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:07,283
Reminded me of my ex-wife.

775
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:08,937
Uh, yes, sir. Please call us

776
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,852
if you remember
anything else.
Okay.

777
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:13,159
Control, 7-Adam-19, I got
the vehicle, unoccupied.

778
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:15,161
Witness says the suspect
here less than five minutes ago.

779
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:16,336
She's on foot.

780
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:17,685
We need backup and an airship

781
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:18,773
to secure a 10-block radius

782
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:19,992
for a grid search.

783
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,039
I don't like this.

784
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,084
She wouldn't have abandoned
the car

785
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:26,607
unless she stopped for a reason.

786
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,261
Odds are it won't be a good one.

787
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:29,915
We gotta find her fast.

788
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:35,790
This is crazy.

789
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,183
There's no way we find her
and the baby in time.

790
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:39,315
We've got multiple units
and an airship searching.

791
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,273
We will find them.

792
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:41,752
How? They could be anywhere.

793
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:43,885
No. On foot with a newborn and
a five-minute head start,

794
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,582
she's definitely within our grid.

795
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:47,019
Someone will have seen her.

796
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:50,457
Just... pray we find her
before she does something rash.

797
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,815
Up on the right.

798
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,126
Not her.

799
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:11,478
Can I make a suggestion?

800
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:12,914
Of course.

801
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,829
Would it be helpful to have
Rita's husband

802
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,050
brought down here
for -- for when she's found?

803
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:19,573
That could be dangerous.

804
00:31:19,616 --> 00:31:21,575
We don't know what the
situation was like at the house,

805
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:24,012
and even if the baby's death
truly was accidental,

806
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:25,840
there could have been
marital issues

807
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,494
that added to Rita's PPD.

808
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:29,191
We'd be introducing a wildcard

809
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:30,540
to an already tenuous situation.

810
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:32,151
Wait, so it's all on you?

811
00:31:32,194 --> 00:31:34,370
I mean, no matter what you find
when you get to her,

812
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:35,502
you have to be ready to
deal with it?

813
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:38,157
What -- What if you make
a mistake?

814
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,985
We have to live with it.

815
00:31:40,028 --> 00:31:42,596
If we can.

816
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:45,207
<i>All units, Air Three has
eyes on the suspect.</i>

817
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:46,295
Fourth Street Bridge.

818
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:49,037
Repeat -- Fourth Street Bridge.

819
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:51,257
She has the baby.
She's standing at the railing.

820
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,824
Possible jumper.
Repeat, possible jumper.

821
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:55,130
Here we go.

822
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:57,263
Control, advise Fire we have
a possible jumper

823
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:58,394
on Fourth Street Bridge.

824
00:31:58,438 --> 00:31:59,700
See if they have a crash pad available.

825
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:03,051
We'll also need RA
and backup units, Code 2 high.

826
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:19,285
Maybe I should stay back.

827
00:32:19,328 --> 00:32:20,677
Uh, it's up to you,

828
00:32:20,721 --> 00:32:22,070
but a friendly face
not in uniform

829
00:32:22,114 --> 00:32:23,854
might actually calm
the situation.

830
00:32:23,898 --> 00:32:25,291
How do you want to play this?

831
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:26,031
You go talk to her.

832
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:27,336
You sure?

833
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,947
Yeah, I'll step in if I need to.

834
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:34,561
W-Why -- Why Nolan?

835
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:38,217
He has a way of connecting with
people in crisis situations.

836
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,610
Hi, Rita.

837
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:41,698
I'm John.

838
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:44,266
How do you know my name?

839
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,659
Uh, Ethan told me.

840
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:48,053
He's very worried about you.

841
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:50,011
I'm fine.

842
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,970
Who's that you got there?

843
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:53,275
Casey.

844
00:32:53,319 --> 00:32:54,581
This is Casey.

845
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:56,017
Oh.

846
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,714
Casey looks a little bit cold.

847
00:32:57,758 --> 00:32:59,673
Why don't we bring her inside,
off the bridge?

848
00:32:59,716 --> 00:33:00,587
No.

849
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,068
She's fine with her mama.

850
00:33:03,111 --> 00:33:05,157
Do you mind if I just make sure?

851
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,375
Stay back.

852
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,420
Okay, yeah. I'll stay back.

853
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:08,769
We -- We can just talk.

854
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:18,170
How's she doing?

855
00:33:18,213 --> 00:33:20,302
Uh, it's touch and go.

856
00:33:20,346 --> 00:33:22,000
- What do you need?
- Keep them back.

857
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:23,740
We don't want to spook her.

858
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:25,742
-Okay.
No, I know it can
feel isolating,

859
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,440
being a parent to a newborn...

860
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:28,571
She's not looking at the baby.

861
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:30,312
...so much to learn.

862
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:32,010
You never feel like
what you're doing...

863
00:33:32,053 --> 00:33:33,576
She's trying to convince herself

864
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,317
that it's her baby
she's holding.

865
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:37,928
Yeah. Deep down inside,
she knows it's not.

866
00:33:37,972 --> 00:33:40,018
What happens when
she figures out the truth?

867
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,671
It's hard to say for sure.

868
00:33:41,715 --> 00:33:43,195
It could break the spell or it
could send her over the edge,

869
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:44,544
literally.

870
00:33:44,587 --> 00:33:46,328
Control, what's the ETA on Fire?

871
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:47,590
<i>Three minutes.</i>

872
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:49,157
Might as well be three hours.

873
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:51,551
Are you thirsty, Rita?

874
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:52,247
I can get you some water.

875
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:53,814
Nolan.

876
00:33:53,857 --> 00:33:55,294
Can I talk to her?

877
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:56,469
Hey, Rita, I'm gonna
introduce you

878
00:33:56,512 --> 00:33:57,992
to my friend, Angela, okay?

879
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,472
Okay.

880
00:33:59,515 --> 00:34:00,995
Hi, Rita.

881
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,084
I'm here to help.

882
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:04,129
Is this Casey?

883
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,045
Yes.

884
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,524
I love that name.

885
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:12,311
My fiancé and I can't agree
on a name for our baby.

886
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:13,921
How did you choose?

887
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:16,097
I don't know.

888
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,230
When she was born, she just
looked like a Casey.

889
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,756
How far along are you?

890
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:24,497
14 weeks.

891
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,108
I'm already scared
about giving birth.

892
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:28,283
The pain.

893
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:30,590
Don't worry about the pain.

894
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:34,289
Once they put your baby
in your arms

895
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:37,727
and you look down into
those beautiful eyes,

896
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,555
it was all worth it.

897
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,124
I heard all newborns
have blue eyes.

898
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:44,647
Not Casey.

899
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:48,042
Dark brown,
right from the start.

900
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,784
The most amazing head of hair.

901
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:51,654
I hope if I have a daughter,

902
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:53,439
she's born with hair.

903
00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:56,442
My cousin's little girl,
she was bald

904
00:34:56,485 --> 00:34:58,487
for like the first 18 months.

905
00:34:58,531 --> 00:35:00,141
Everyone thought she was a boy.

906
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:01,403
I love putting

907
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,884
Casey's hair in little pigtails.

908
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:07,757
She always fights me,
but she looks so cute.

909
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:12,153
Rita, can you do something
for me?

910
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:13,763
Can you look at Casey?

911
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,896
Just look in those pretty,
brown eyes.

912
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,421
No.

913
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:20,596
Please, Rita.

914
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,337
I need you to look in her eyes.

915
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:35,959
It's not Casey, is it?

916
00:35:36,003 --> 00:35:40,138
No.

917
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,792
Here. I got her.

918
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:45,491
I'll get her back to
her mother, okay?

919
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:51,453
Tell her I'm sorry.

920
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:55,065
Thank you, Rita.

921
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:57,242
That was a very brave thing you did,

922
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:59,287
and now I need you to come with me, okay?

923
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:02,899
My baby died.

924
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:04,336
I know.

925
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:05,511
I'm so sorry.

926
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:11,647
Come on. Come on.

927
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,669
Well, thank you for today.

928
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:35,976
This is an experience
I will not forget.

929
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:38,108
Well, we should schedule

930
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:40,067
another one of these little ride alongs

931
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,895
so that we can continue the conversation.

932
00:36:41,938 --> 00:36:43,505
Oh, that won't be necessary.

933
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,205
The book's already written,
isn't it?

934
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:49,119
I sent it to my publisher
last week.

935
00:36:49,163 --> 00:36:50,599
Mm. What?

936
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:52,122
Then what was today about, then?

937
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,168
Just an anecdote
for the book tour?

938
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,562
No, I didn't know the day was
gonna end up the way it did.

939
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:58,520
But how do you write a book
about policing

940
00:36:58,564 --> 00:36:59,608
without having seen it up close?

941
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:01,610
Oh, I have seen it. Believe me.

942
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,133
Today may have been
my first ride along,

943
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,222
but it was not my first time

944
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,788
sitting in the back seat
of a cop car.

945
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:08,138
I see, but if you're going to
fix an engine,

946
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:09,792
don't you think it would be
helpful to look under the hood?

947
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:12,012
That is a flawed analogy,
Officer Nolan,

948
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:13,492
because a car is not
actively trying to

949
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:14,710
keep you from fixing it.

950
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:17,452
Uh, excuse me.

951
00:37:19,759 --> 00:37:22,762
Look, I get that the path
to real change

952
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:24,764
seems almost impossible.

953
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:27,723
I mean, police departments are
pros at circling the wagons

954
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:30,291
when public opinion
turns against them.

955
00:37:30,335 --> 00:37:33,076
But I promise you,

956
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,427
the only way
things really will change

957
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,820
is if cops get on board.

958
00:37:37,864 --> 00:37:39,257
I agree.

959
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,694
But cops only act when activists
make so much noise,

960
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:43,304
they cannot be ignored.

961
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:44,827
Like in Camden.

962
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:47,177
Look, you're talking to
two police officers

963
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:48,831
who would like to
see things change,

964
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:51,834
and we're not the only ones at
the station that feels this way.

965
00:37:51,878 --> 00:37:55,316
I just think that...
uh, maybe you could benefit

966
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,753
from some of our insights.

967
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:02,802
Alright.

968
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,674
You sold me.

969
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:07,676
Great. I'll tell Sergeant Grey.

970
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,243
I'm sure he'd love to
be part of the conversation.

971
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,853
Oh, thank you.

972
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:13,726
And thank you both for
the ride along.

973
00:38:13,769 --> 00:38:15,336
I will see you in class.

974
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,642
Looking forward.

975
00:38:19,732 --> 00:38:22,604
I think that went well,
all things considered.

976
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:24,780
Oh, yeah. No, she's definitely
gonna give you an "A."

977
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:26,608
- You think?
- No.

978
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:28,349
She is gonna make you earn it
in class,

979
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:29,698
like the rest of her students.

980
00:38:29,742 --> 00:38:31,221
Fair enough. Yeah.

981
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:32,701
You have any plans for
the rest of the night?

982
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:34,921
Hugging my daughter
until she is sick of it

983
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,923
and then hugging her some more.
Sounds nice.

984
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:37,924
Nolan.

985
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:41,101
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Alright.

986
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:42,929
Sir. Well?

987
00:38:42,972 --> 00:38:44,539
How'd it go with Professor Ryan?

988
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:46,149
Good, I think.

989
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:48,021
She's gonna be calling you to
talk about, uh, police reform --

990
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,283
for her book.

991
00:38:51,416 --> 00:38:53,766
You point her my way to get back
at me for the ride along?

992
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:54,810
No, sir. No.

993
00:38:54,854 --> 00:38:55,811
I just know
how committed you are

994
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:57,900
to making things better.

995
00:38:57,944 --> 00:39:00,294
Even if it does mean having to
admit you're wrong to do it.

996
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,383
Oh. Uh, I'm sorry?

997
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:05,691
When was I ever wrong?

998
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:08,998
Well, nothing comes to
mind off hand.

999
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,784
I guess there was that one time
you said if I succeeded,

1000
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:14,352
your house would be
"flooded with middle-aged losers

1001
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:18,530
looking for an 'Eat Pray Love'
path to reinvention."

1002
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:20,836
I wrote it down.

1003
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,839
You haven't succeeded yet,
Officer Nolan.

1004
00:39:23,883 --> 00:39:26,233
Yes, sir.

1005
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:26,973
Good night, sir.

1006
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:29,410
Good night.

1007
00:39:29,454 --> 00:39:31,412
Can't wait to get out
of this uniform.

1008
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:32,935
Hey, thanks again for
riding with me.

1009
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:34,154
Are you kidding me?

1010
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:35,895
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

1011
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:38,376
And now it's end of shift,

1012
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:40,813
and you are no longer a rookie.

1013
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,946
How does it feel?

1014
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,992
Unreal.

1015
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:48,124
I mean, everything in my life
has been geared towards

1016
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:52,607
getting me to this moment,
and... now it's here.

1017
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:54,392
Kinda can't believe it,
to be honest.

1018
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:57,525
Well, congratulations.

1019
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:59,222

the perfect way to end the year.

1062
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:36,058
Exactly.

1063
00:41:36,102 --> 00:41:37,495
Where you going?

1064
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,889
Uh, home.

1065
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:42,891
No, you're not.

1066
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:44,980
You are coming to dinner
with Lila and me.

1067
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:47,505
Uh, that's -- that's very nice
of you, but I'm okay.

1068
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:49,071
No, you're not.

1069
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:51,160
You feel like a failure
because they're moving on

1070
00:41:51,204 --> 00:41:52,988
and you're not.

1071
00:41:53,032 --> 00:41:55,251
But you will.

1072
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:56,775
I appreciate that, but you, uh,

1073
00:41:56,818 --> 00:41:59,125
certainly don't have to take me
to dinner out of pity.

1074
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:01,344
It's not pity
when you're paying.

1075
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:02,607
♪ I'll keep filling up...

1076
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,260
W-Well, how can I say no
to that?

1077
00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:06,132
You can't.

1078
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:07,829
I'm gonna go pick up Lila.

1079
00:42:07,873 --> 00:42:10,745
Reservation is under my name
at Mercado.

1080
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:13,356
And I expect a skinny margarita
waiting when I get there.

1081
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,227
Yes, ma'am. Mm-hmm.

1082
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,272
And, um...

1083
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:17,273
Thank you.

1084
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:18,492
You're welcome.

1085
