1
00:00:02,306 --> 00:00:04,961
Y-You're not listening.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,441
I can destroy your life
with the click of a button.

3
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:08,356
These pictures will go
to every one of your contacts.

4
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:10,053
<i>Please, I don't have that kind of money.</i>

5
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,361
5,000 in Bitcoin
or you lose everything.

6
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:16,886
I'll, uh -- I'll --
I'll get right back to you.

7
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,069
Afternoon. Can I get your name?

8
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:28,332
Uh, Dennis Kern. Why?
What's, uh -- What's going on?

9
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:29,986
We got a report
from your neighbor.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,205
Someone in this apartment's
stealing Wi-Fi?

11
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,424
<i>Police! Help! Can you hear me?</i>

12
00:00:33,468 --> 00:00:35,078
Who was that? Nothing.

13
00:00:35,122 --> 00:00:36,384
<i>Help!</i>

14
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:37,863
Step back, Dennis.

15
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:39,169
Hello?

16
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:40,779
<i>O-Over here. On the computer.</i>

17
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:46,263
Oh. Hello. Who are you?

18
00:00:46,307 --> 00:00:49,005
<i>Todd Asher. I'm that little
bastard's PE teacher.</i>

19
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,659
<i>He's blackmailing me
with pictures</i>

20
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:51,790
<i>he hacked from my computer.</i>

21
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:53,053
Oh, well, that was stupid,
Dennis.

22
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:54,793
And very illegal.

23
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:56,099
Gonna have to call your parents.

24
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:58,058
Which one do you think
will be less pissed?

25
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,885
Um... my dad.

26
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,278
Great. What's your mom's number?

27
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:03,237
Sir, I'm gonna need your address

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,239
so we can send a unit to your
house to take a statement.

29
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:07,763
<i>Sure, but I have to get
those photos back.</i>

30
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:09,547
<i>Please. I-If they get out --</i>

31
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:11,332
Alright. How about I -- Oh!

32
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,290
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Whoa.
Is that your --

33
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:14,900
♪ Oh, oh

34
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:19,296
♪ I'm gonna win for you
like I know you want me to do ♪

35
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:24,693
Hey. Good morning.

36
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,348
Good morning. I hope you're hungry.

37
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:29,915
I'm making pecan pancakes.
Your favorite.

38
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,352
Uh, they would be,
except for the whole

39
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:32,614
I'm-allergic-to-nuts thing.

40
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:34,355
You are? Since when?

41
00:01:34,398 --> 00:01:36,444
Uh, that would be since the day
you birthed me.

42
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:39,490
And your flight back to
Pennsylvania is in three hours.

43
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:40,578
A-Are you packed yet?

44
00:01:40,622 --> 00:01:41,840
Oh, I canceled my ticket.

45
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:43,451
You what? Mom, we -- we agreed

46
00:01:43,494 --> 00:01:44,669
you'd only stay the one night.

47
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:46,323
No, you agreed.

48
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:47,803
I'll get that. Mother.

49
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:49,239
Turn them before they burn.

50
00:01:49,283 --> 00:01:52,112
Mom, this is not
entirely optimal for me.

51
00:01:52,155 --> 00:01:54,070
You know I have to
be hyper-focused on work right now.

52
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,289
Come on. Come on.

53
00:01:55,332 --> 00:01:56,290
Put them right there
in the corner.

54
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:58,161
What's in the boxes?

55
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,945
Well, I thought since you're
"hyper-focused on work"

56
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,252
that I'd make use of my time.

57
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:06,822
I came across this great deal
from a wholesaler of CBD oil.

58
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:09,564
Professor Hempstein's Organic CBD Oil?

59
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:12,523
Relax. Marijuana is legal
in California.

60
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,003
As a cop, you should know that.

61
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:15,613
I do. So this is what you spent
your money on

62
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,137
when you sold the engagement ring?

63
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,964
No!

64
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,228
W-- I mean, not all of it.

65
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:23,578
A-And what, do you plan on
staying here until you sell it all?

66
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,101
Don't you think you should
have asked me first, Mom?

67
00:02:26,668 --> 00:02:29,061
I told you to flip the pancakes!

68
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:36,591
Show me your hands now!

69
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,201
What are you doing?!

70
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:39,724
Lady, I will knock your ass out!

71
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:40,856
Get your hands off my wife!

72
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:41,900
Everybody on the ground now!

73
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:48,907
I-I live up the street.
I'm a cop.

74
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:51,214
Relax. It's me.

75
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,737
Sarge. Good morning.

76
00:02:52,781 --> 00:02:54,391
I, uh, saw the shop
creeping up --

77
00:02:54,435 --> 00:02:55,827
I get it.

78
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,220
My dad's a cop. I'm a cop.

79
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:58,395
I shouldn't panic
at the sight --

80
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,615
West, I've been a Black man

81
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,182
a lot longer than you have.

82
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:03,879
I get it.

83
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:05,402
Why are you here, sir?

84
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:06,882
You were right.

85
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:08,362
Benching Officer Stanton
isn't enough.

86
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,581
He's a disgrace to the badge.
He has to go.

87
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,669
But your hands are tied, right?

88
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:13,497
Mine are, but yours aren't.

89
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:16,500
So, son, what are you willing
to risk

90
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,807
to take Stanton off the job?

91
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,375
Whatever it takes, sir. Good.

92
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:24,682
See, I've crossed paths with
a hundred cops like Stanton,

93
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:27,294
the kind that dip their toes
over the line constantly,

94
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:29,296
but nothing egregious,

95
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:31,211
nothing flagrant,
nothing actionable.

96
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,908
And he knows
what he can get away with.

97
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:34,605
Yep. So how do I get him?

98
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:37,260
You're going to "keep book."

99
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:39,741
Chronicle every offense,
big or small.

100
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:42,265
If we're lucky,
the accumulation of infractions

101
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,659
will be enough to take his gun
and his badge.

102
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,008
Isn't this how Nolan and Harper

103
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,749
got in trouble with Internal Affairs?

104
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,230
They didn't have supervision.
You got me.

105
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:51,796
For now,
you're just keeping book.

106
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,842
When we get enough, we go to IA.

107
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:56,192
If we go before, we put
your father in a bad position.

108
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,280
Yes, sir.

109
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:58,281
Thank you.

110
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,848
I won't let you down.

111
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,372
Now, listen closely.

112
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,461
Doug Stanton can know nothing
about this.

113
00:04:04,505 --> 00:04:05,897
Act like his best friend.

114
00:04:05,941 --> 00:04:09,118
Don't give him any reason
to suspect.

115
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:11,512
Only Bradford and Chen
are in the know about this.

116
00:04:11,555 --> 00:04:13,557
I'm gonna assign you all
to the same sector,

117
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,907
so every time you and Stanton
take a call,

118
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:17,169
they will be
automatically filled.

119
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:18,780
Okay, I can handle myself.

120
00:04:18,823 --> 00:04:21,130
Non-negotiable, West.

121
00:04:21,173 --> 00:04:23,175
If you're going after Stanton,
you're gonna have backup.

122
00:04:32,097 --> 00:04:33,751
Really?

123
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,188
What? Our baby has weird taste.

124
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:38,321
Probably gets it from your side
of the family.

125
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:39,757
This is awful.

126
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,324
Full of fat, preservatives, sugar.

127
00:04:41,368 --> 00:04:43,979
It's evil in a jar. Don't even get
me started on the pickles.

128
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:45,459
<i>We</i> have to watch what you eat.

129
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:47,112
You don't have
to watch anything.

130
00:04:47,156 --> 00:04:48,853
Hey, did you make an appointment
to see my mom's OB/GYN yet?

131
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:50,855
I'm not going to your mom's
lady doctor.

132
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,640
I'm happy with mine,
just like I'm happy

133
00:04:52,683 --> 00:04:54,337
eating pickles Santa style.

134
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:56,687
She's a renowned specialist. The best.

135
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:57,819
I mean, don't you want the best
for our baby?

136
00:04:57,862 --> 00:04:59,386
Wesley, I love you dearly,

137
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:01,170
but you're so WASP-y sometimes.

138
00:05:01,213 --> 00:05:03,303
I get it. You're an only child.

139
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,827
But my mom brought five kids
into this world

140
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,350
while working two jobs

141
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:08,873
and eating
whatever the hell she wanted.

142
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,048
Women have babies all the time.

143
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:11,441
It's easy.
Don't make it so hard.

144
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:12,486
Angela, I just think that we --

145
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:15,271
Stop micromanaging my pregnancy.

146
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,272
<i>Our</i> pregnancy.

147
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,795
Oh, really?

148
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,841
Who wears the stretchy pants
in this family?

149
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,018
Exactly.

150
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:28,893
You're driving today. I am?

151
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:31,853
Mm-hmm.
Until about 9:05.What happens at 9:05?

152
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:34,203
Actually, it's what happens
at 9:00 a.m. sharp that matters.

153
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,771
Lila wants to take this summer
class at the Music Academy,

154
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:39,251
and spots are extremely limited,

155
00:05:39,295 --> 00:05:40,905
so if I miss
the registration window,

156
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,864
she can't get in. But
what if we get a call?

157
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,387
Wouldn't it be safer
if your ex did that?

158
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:46,389
You think that I can't handle

159
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:48,609
enrolling my own daughter
into a class?

160
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:51,046
No, of course not.'Cause my baby
wants classes at the Music Academy.

161
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:55,006
I -- I can get her classes
at the Music Academy.

162
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:56,834
Is this a repeat
of an argument you had earlier

163
00:05:56,878 --> 00:05:58,401
with your ex-husband?

164
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,534
No.

165
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:02,013
Get into the shop.

166
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,711
Let's go.

167
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:11,414
Catch the game last night?

168
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,329
Yeah. It was brutal.

169
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,939
Can't believe they were able
to come back on us.

170
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:17,377
Uh-huh. Yeah, I believed.

171
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,117
That's why I won 200 bucks.

172
00:06:24,427 --> 00:06:26,342
Anything look out of place
to you?

173
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,648
Uh, I don't --

174
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,650
Dispatch, 7-Adam-07,

175
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:32,348
show us at a pedestrian stop,
Waring and Seward.

176
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,438
Seward and Waring. Let's go.

177
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,353
Relax. We can't be too obvious.

178
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,355
Doug realizes we're shadowing
him, Jackson's screwed.

179
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:42,010
We'll get close,
wait to see if it escalates.

180
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,711
Hey, bud. Live around here?

181
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:49,670
No, sir.
Just came from a friend's.

182
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:51,454
Ah. Where you off to now?

183
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:54,065
Bus stop. Bus stop's that way.

184
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,676
Got any I.D.?

185
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:56,720
Yes, sir.

186
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:00,898
Dispatch, 7-Adam-07.

187
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:03,466
Clear for a party.
Last of Gusta, first of Armand.

188
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,991
Have you on your way
in a second.

189
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,471
Unless she comes back
with bad news.

190
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:10,430
You got
any outstanding warrants?

191
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:11,518
I've never been arrested, sir.

192
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:17,132
7-Adam-07, Gusta comes
back clear and valid.

193
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,700
There you go. Bus stop's that way, sir.

194
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:22,137
Thank you, officers. Of course.

195
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,966
See that's
the kind of citizen I like.

196
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:28,186
Knows his place,
respects authority.

197
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,797
You know, we wouldn't have
half the problems we have

198
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,494
if more of them behaved
like that one.

199
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,764
7-Adam-07, Code 4,
show us clear.

200
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,507
This so isn't fair to Jackson.

201
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,204
I know. Having to ride
next to a guy,

202
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:47,902
hoping he doesn't cross
the line.

203
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:49,773
Can't imagine what that's like.

204
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,645
I can.

205
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:53,429
Look, my first day as a rookie,

206
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,953
I thought you were gonna be my Doug.

207
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:58,782
Excuse me?
How am I anything like that guy?

208
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,784
Do you remember
our first day out?

209
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,831
I was walking
alongside the shop,

210
00:08:03,874 --> 00:08:05,702
then those Spanish-speaking
gardeners honked at us.

211
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,399
You turned it into a Tim Test,

212
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:08,836
and when I didn't translate

213
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,447
your less-than-PC words
to them correctly,

214
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,579
you took my head off.

215
00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:14,276
So what? I'm a bad cop now?

216
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,451
No. Not at all.

217
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,627
But that was a bad stop.

218
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:19,673
How do you think those men felt
about that interaction with you?

219
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,239
You think
it was a positive experience?

220
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:23,633
I'm not looking
for five-star Yelp reviews.

221
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:25,635
I've got a job to do. Well, so did they.

222
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:26,506
They were just trying
to get to work,

223
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,638
and then they met you.

224
00:08:28,682 --> 00:08:31,598
Excessive and unnecessary use
of the horn is against the law.

225
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:33,338
Plus they had several
vehicle violations.

226
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:34,731
I could've impounded
their truck.

227
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:36,428
And that justified you
terrorizing them?

228
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:37,560
Terrorizing? Yeah.

229
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,431
Really? That's it.

230
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:40,563
You know, don't say another word
to me.

231
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:41,651
We're done
with this conversation.

232
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:45,089
It's 8:58.

233
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,874
Class registration
is about to begin.

234
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,658
Can you pull over, please?
Thank you.

235
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:51,792
We are not taking any calls.

236
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:53,054
What if we get a priority one?

237
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:54,838
Why are you trying to jinx me?

238
00:08:54,882 --> 00:08:56,797
Officers! Officers. How can I help you?

239
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,712
You need to know what's going on
in my neighbor's backyard.

240
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,104
And you jinxed me.

241
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:02,367
No, I didn't.
What seems to be the problem?

242
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:05,066
He has been out there building
this thing for -- for weeks.

243
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,502
I know he doesn't have a permit.

244
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,025
Okay.
Sounds like an illegal add-on.

245
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:10,767
You make your call,
get Lila in that course,

246
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,290
and I will take care of this.

247
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:13,944
Alright. Radio if you need me.

248
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,642
Right. But only if you
really need me.

249
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:17,644
I --

250
00:09:17,687 --> 00:09:19,602
Shall we? Yes. Please.

251
00:09:23,388 --> 00:09:25,652
Just so you know,
Gary's a bit of a --

252
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,392
what's the word?
- - moron.

253
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:29,438
See? This can't be legal.

254
00:09:31,396 --> 00:09:33,398
Uh, sir? Can I have a word
with you about --

255
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:35,357
Uh, not now.
I'm trying to find my helmet.

256
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,706
We're at T-minus 10 minutes.

257
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,447
Where you headed?

258
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,927
Up.

259
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,151
<i>Music Academy.
How can I help you?</i>

260
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:49,371
Hi, uh, yeah.
I-I'm trying to get my daughter

261
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:51,068
into the summer program.

262
00:09:51,112 --> 00:09:53,723
Is there still room? <i>Let me check.</i>

263
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,072
He's a Flat Earther.

264
00:09:55,116 --> 00:09:56,596
Says he's out to prove
the world is a pancake.

265
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,988
No. No. Not a pancake.

266
00:09:58,032 --> 00:10:00,251
A disc within a dome, hmm?

267
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:01,949
<i>Sir, you can't launch that.</i>

268
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:04,342
W-Why not? I have permission.

269
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:05,430
From whom?

270
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:10,479
Sir. Step on out.

271
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:11,523
I'd stand back if I were you.

272
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:12,742
<i>Sir, just step on out</i>

273
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:13,743
<i>before you do anything silly.</i>

274
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:16,180
Ten, nine, eight...

275
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:19,314
...seven, six...

276
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:21,925
<i>Yes, there is.
Can I get her name?</i>

277
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:23,144
Uh, yes. Yeah. Her n--

278
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:34,155
Did I make it to space? You sure did.

279
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:35,460
And when you landed,
you said the Earth was round.

280
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:37,245
It is?

281
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:38,942
<i>We're sorry, but registration</i>

282
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:40,640
<i>for the Music Academy
is now closed.</i>

283
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:44,687
Oh, my -- I can't believe this.

284
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,168
I promised Lila I would get her
into that class.

285
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:48,560
Well, you can't blame yourself.

286
00:10:48,604 --> 00:10:50,084
I don't.

287
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:53,522
I-I see. Look, uh,
this could be a good thing.

288
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:55,132
I mean, a teachable moment
for Lila.

289
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:57,178
Show her that life
has disappointments.

290
00:10:57,221 --> 00:11:00,268
Right. Like when her mother lost
custody of her for two years.

291
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:02,879
Nolan, my daughter knows
all about disappointments.

292
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:05,142
What I'm trying to do right now
is show her

293
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:06,970
how Mommy can come through
for her.

294
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:07,841
I'm sorry.

295
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,454
It's not over yet.
Give me the keys.

296
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:13,716
Thank you.

297
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,675
Are you still mad at me? I'm not mad.

298
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,677
Really? Because you look mad.

299
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,026
At least madder than usual.

300
00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:20,897
Thank you for coming.

301
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:22,594
We keep getting
our deliveries stolen.

302
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:24,640
Most people on the block
are having the same problem.

303
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,641
Sounds like a porch pirate.

304
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,034
No front door camera.

305
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,252
We'll walk around and see

306
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:29,427
if any of your neighbors
have one.

307
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:35,172
Okay, I'm not mad,

308
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:36,304
but I am upset.

309
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:37,740
I knew it.

310
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,873
At myself. You're right.

311
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,570
I used the situation
with the gardeners

312
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:44,747
without thinking
about the impact I had on them.

313
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:46,227
I c-can't undo it,

314
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,796
but I can make sure
I never do it again.

315
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,406
That's progress.

316
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:52,799
I'm proud of you.

317
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:54,714
I'm thrilled. Mm-hmm.

318
00:11:57,238 --> 00:11:59,980
♪ You better run, run, run,
run, run, go ♪

319
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:01,198
Wait. The porch pirate
is a doggy?

320
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,074
♪ You better run, run,
run, run, run ♪

321
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:13,428

Good boy!

324
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:18,433
Who's a good boy?

325
00:12:18,476 --> 00:12:19,869
Who's under arrest?

326
00:12:19,913 --> 00:12:22,524
Bad dog. Bad dog.

327
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:27,224
Hey, what are you doing here?

328
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:28,748
We need to talk.

329
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,488
About seeing my mom's OB/GYN
for prenatal care --

330
00:12:30,532 --> 00:12:31,489
Shut up with that.

331
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:37,321
They don't know I'm pregnant,
remember?

332
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:39,193
Look, I wasn't that loud.
They're not gonna figure it out.

333
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,542
They're detectives.

334
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,762
Figuring out things
is in the job description.

335
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,896
Speaking of which,
why are you so hung up on me

336
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,593
going to your mom's OB/GYN?

337
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:50,204
She's a specialist.

338
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,597
So you've said. What's going on?

339
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:59,517
Look, after my dad died,
I took a genetic test.

340
00:12:59,561 --> 00:13:02,303
Turns out I'm predisposed
to Fragile X Syndrome.

341
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:05,785
It can cause
mental disabilities, seizures...

342
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:09,005
Why are you just now telling me?

343
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:10,572
I don't know.

344
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:12,139
We didn't plan to get pregnant
this soon.

345
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,228
I wanted to tell you.
I-I didn't know how to do it.

346
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,099
You and the baby mean everything
to me,

347
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:17,622
and if my DNA -- Stop.

348
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,930
I'll make an appointment to see
your mom's doctor.

349
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,804
Look, I-I have to get back
to work.

350
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:26,022
Angela --I'll see you at home.

351
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:36,337
Like I said, I-I called
at 9:00 on the dot,

352
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,860
and -- and I got through,

353
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:39,862
but then a man fell
from the sky and --

354
00:13:39,906 --> 00:13:42,647
Please spare me the theatrics.

355
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:44,301
No, no, no. T-This really
actually happened.

356
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:45,433
I can show you video on my --

357
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,130
I'll give you points
for originality,

358
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:49,306
but rules are rules.

359
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,830
Better luck next year.

360
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,006
No, sir, I have it
right here. I --

361
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,485
Nyla, right?

362
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,400
Alonzo Smith. Holly's dad.

363
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:58,098
Is she the one
with the long hair?

364
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:00,056
God, no.
The one with the braids.

365
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,623
Long hair Holly's a monster.

366
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,364
She really is, isn't she?

367
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:05,322
Was that the Music Academy
director you were talking to?

368
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,889
Uh, yeah.

369
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,891
I, uh -- I missed registration,

370
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:10,545
so I was hoping
I could come down here

371
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,112
and try to appeal in person.

372
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:14,897
Did you miss registration, too?

373
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:15,985
Overslept.

374
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,726
So I thought I'd try swaying him

375
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,075
with some cronuts from DKs.

376
00:14:19,119 --> 00:14:21,121
Oh, I love DKs.

377
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:22,687
Take one.

378
00:14:22,731 --> 00:14:23,950
No, no. I can't.

379
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,299
No, that's <i>your</i> bribe.

380
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:26,909
I insist.

381
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:29,085
If he wasn't moved
by a cop in uniform,

382
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:31,435
what's a box full of sugar
and dough gonna do?

383
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:38,878
My ex is going
to kill me.
Mm. So is mine.

384
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,705
No, I'm serious.
I got like an hour to live.

385
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:42,751
So if you get called
to a homicide in Silver Lake,

386
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:44,057
that'll be me.

387
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,319
At least I'll get
to see you again.

388
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,021
Look, I'm gonna poke around,
see if I can find an angle

389
00:14:52,065 --> 00:14:54,458
to work to get Holly in.

390
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:56,721
You want me to let you know if
I find a work-around for Lila?

391
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:02,379
Yeah, actually.
Uh, I'd appreciate that.

392
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,210
You know you ran
that stop sign back there?

393
00:15:07,254 --> 00:15:09,343
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

394
00:15:09,386 --> 00:15:10,692
They're in my bag.

395
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:11,998
Is it okay if I reach in
and grab them?

396
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,043
Slowly.

397
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,566
Why're you so nervous?

398
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,785
No reason.

399
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,661
Erika. Anything illegal
in the car or on your person?

400
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:27,883
No, sir.Great. You won't mind
if we search the car, then?

401
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,885
Uh, we don't need to search
the car.

402
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,582
Like you said,
nothing illegal in here,

403
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,802
so you don't mind if we conduct
a search, right?

404
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:37,762
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

405
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:41,723
But... there are guns
in the trunk.

406
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:43,986
Hands where I can see them.
Step out of the car.

407
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:46,989
They're my ex-husband's.

408
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,164
I was on my way
to the police station

409
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,992
to turn them in. Head to the sidewalk.

410
00:15:50,036 --> 00:15:51,689
Look, we're finalizing
our divorce,

411
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:52,952
and he's not happy
with how it's going,

412
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:54,649
and he's been threatening
to kill me.

413
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:55,867
Did you get a restraining order?

414
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:57,217
Yes. But it doesn't stop him

415
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,045
from driving by the house
every day.

416
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,046
You don't live
with your husband?

417
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,265
Ex-husband. And no.

418
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:03,484
So how'd you get the guns?

419
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:04,833
I used my old key.

420
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:09,272
Erika, you're under arrest. What?

421
00:16:09,316 --> 00:16:10,926
Burglary, possession
of stolen property...

422
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,276
Wh--...illegally transporting
firearms.

423
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,931
Why? No. I-I told you
I was going to turn
them in to the police.

424
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,237
You can tell all that
to the judge.

425
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,239
Okay, can I talk to you
for a second, sir?

426
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,853
Take a seat on the curb.

427
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:28,552
Look, do we really need
to take her in?

428
00:16:28,596 --> 00:16:31,294
Let's just book the guns
and write it up for DA review.

429
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:34,254
C'mon, man. What do you say?

430
00:16:34,297 --> 00:16:37,213
First of all, never speak to me
like that again.

431
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:39,041
"C'mon, man"?

432
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:40,434
I'm your superior officer,

433
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:42,305
not one of your homeboys.

434
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,046
Yes, sir. And secondly,

435
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,048
that woman just admitted
to three felonies.

436
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,658
She says she's turning in
the weapons,

437
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:49,269
but who's to say
she wasn't on her way

438
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:52,098
to blast
her ex-husband's brains out?

439
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,056
She's going in.
Fill out her booking sheet.

440
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,492
I'll call in a tow.

441
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:00,628
Come on. Oh, please.

442
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,412
Please, you don't have
to do this, okay?

443
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:06,025
Look, help me.
Look, I can't go to jail.

444
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:07,374
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

445
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:08,723
Please.

446
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:13,597
I'm telling you, it was awful.

447
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:15,164
"Awful but lawful."

448
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,514
Look, and, by the way, her story
completely checked out.

449
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:20,561
She has a restraining order,
called 911 a bunch of times.

450
00:17:20,604 --> 00:17:22,128
She needed protection
from her ex.

451
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:24,260
But instead of helping...

452
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:26,828
turns out that she needed
protection from the cops, too.

453
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,177
Tim and I were stuck on a call.

454
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:29,396
If we'd been free,
maybe we could've --

455
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:31,224
No, no. This is my fault.

456
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:33,574
Grey wanted to bench Doug.

457
00:17:33,617 --> 00:17:37,099
I... I pushed him to do more,

458
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,014
and now that woman is in jail
for no reason.

459
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,103
You can't blame yourself.

460
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:43,105
Getting rid of Doug
is gonna take time.

461
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:45,107
But how many more people are
gonna get hurt in the meantime?

462
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:48,023
I just -- I thought you
supported me

463
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,372
staying on the job
a while longer.

464
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:51,418
I do.

465
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:53,985
What you are trying to do here
is important.

466
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:55,726
But I'm not gonna
just sit around

467
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,424
waiting to start my second act.

468
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:58,425
So what, you want a job?

469
00:17:58,468 --> 00:17:59,817
Maybe. I don't know,

470
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:02,298
but that's what I'm here
to talk about.

471
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:03,691
Oh. Okay, great.

472
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,649
Um, have you considered
volunteering?

473
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,173
Oh, I'm not here to talk to you.

474
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:10,524
I need to reinvent myself,
find my new purpose,

475
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:13,309
and who knows more about that
than John Nolan?

476
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,009
I didn't know you could do that.

477
00:18:18,053 --> 00:18:19,098
Do what? Giggle.

478
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,229
I don't giggle. Uh-huh.

479
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:21,404
Who you texting?

480
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:23,102
No one.

481
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,365
It's just -- It's --
It's another one of the parents

482
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:27,193
that's trying to get his kid
into the Academy.

483
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:29,630
<i>His</i> kid. Oh, is he single?
Is he nice?

484
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:31,022
Nope. We are not doing this.

485
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:32,415
Hey, guys. Luna, hi.

486
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:35,462
Hi. John, I have got a favor
to ask.

487
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:39,118
Of course. I'm starting to think about
my second act in life,

488
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,207
and I was wondering
if I could pick your brain.

489
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,034
I would be honored. Yes.

490
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:45,602
Oh, great.
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

491
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,082
Can I get you two anything?

492
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,344
I'm set.
No, no, I'm good.
Thank you.

493
00:18:48,388 --> 00:18:49,650
Okay, great, thanks.

494
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,046
Whatever you do,
do not give her any advice.

495
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:56,744
That's exactly
what she asked for.

496
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:59,660
Oh, my God.
You cannot be this naive.

497
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:03,142
The boss' wife wants
to "rethink her second act"?

498
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,578
That is between her
and the boss.

499
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,449
Trust me, you do not want
to get involved.

500
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:09,800
Just listen, smile, and nod.

501
00:19:09,844 --> 00:19:11,367
But what if I can actually
help her?

502
00:19:11,411 --> 00:19:14,501
But what if Sergeant Grey
doesn't like the help you give?

503
00:19:14,544 --> 00:19:17,243
Who do you think
he will blame then?

504
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:18,679
Good point. Mm-hmm.

505
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,768
Just smile, nod,

506
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:24,206
and sympathetically say,
"I hear you."

507
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,207
You got it?

508
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:26,730
I hear you.

509
00:19:28,732 --> 00:19:29,820
Hey, what's the deal
with Jackson?

510
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:31,474
Kid's questioning all my stops.

511
00:19:31,518 --> 00:19:33,172
Sounds like the mark
of a good student.

512
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:34,956
I don't see you letting Chen
question your every move.

513
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,784
My last rookie
didn't ask questions.

514
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:39,352
And he was a "brotha."

515
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:42,137
Maybe the issue isn't
the student, it's the teacher.

516
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,967
Huh.

517
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,751
Yeah, maybe you're right.

518
00:19:47,795 --> 00:19:50,145
Whatever nonsense Lopez
was teaching him,

519
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,800
I got 20 days
to straighten him out.

520
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:55,455
I climbed the ladder
to VP of Sales,

521
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:57,413
but that was 19 years ago.

522
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:59,328
Yeah, I hear you.

523
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:02,592
Now Dominique's in college,
and Wade, he's busy as ever.

524
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:05,943
It just feels like everyone
is moving forward except me.

525
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,510
Mm. I hear you.

526
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:08,859
So now you know
my whole life story.

527
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:11,906
What -- What do you think?

528
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:18,695
Well, um... when my son went off
to college

529
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:20,088
and my divorce was finalized,

530
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:22,960
I-I just --
I felt a little lost, you know?

531
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:25,354
Just like you. So how did you figure out
what to do next?

532
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:28,139
Well, looking down the barrel
of a gun during a bank robbery

533
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:30,054
will give you some clarity,
but I advise against it.

534
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,537
Okay.
Well, what would you advise?

535
00:20:34,581 --> 00:20:36,583
I would advise...

536
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:41,892
...just wait.

537
00:20:41,936 --> 00:20:45,287
And be open
for your eureka moment.

538
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:47,202
My eureka moment.

539
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,464
I love it.

540
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,465
Yes. It's perfect.

541
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:50,988
It's -- It's profound

542
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:53,077
yet... so simple.

543
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,165
Thank you. Okay.

544
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,780
I will speak kindly of you
at your funeral.

545
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:05,089
No more pain, no more anxiety.

546
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:07,701
By the way, do you know my son,
Officer Nolan?

547
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,268
He swears by this stuff.

548
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,444
I mean, how else
would a 48-year-old rookie

549
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,315
make it in the LAPD?

550
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,317
I'm 46. I'm 46.

551
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:16,623
Hi. Hi.

552
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,581
I'm his mother. Oh.

553
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,017
Evelyn. Hi. Hi. Oh.

554
00:21:20,061 --> 00:21:22,324
And this is gonna
change your life.

555
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:26,023
20 bucks a pop, 3 for $50.
Certified organic.

556
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,982
Mom --I see why you use
this stuff, Nolan.

557
00:21:28,025 --> 00:21:29,679
My neck's already better.

558
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:31,420
I don't, Smitty. I don't --
I don't actually use it.

559
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:32,639
Mom, what are you doing?
These are my co-workers.

560
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:34,205
Now they're my customers.

561
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:35,598
Nolan. We gotta roll.

562
00:21:35,642 --> 00:21:38,427
Uh... please stop being here.

563
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:40,647
Just go home, okay?
Uh, so good talking to you.

564
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,388
Thank you for the advice.

565
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:48,307
Why should he have to go
through this with Stanton?

566
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,831
If I did one-tenth of the things
that that guy does on the job,

567
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:51,919
I'd be gone so fast.

568
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:53,529
As a rookie, sure,

569
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:54,704
but not once
you're off probation.

570
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:56,793
There are layers of safeguards

571
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:58,142
that protect cops
from getting fired,

572
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,840
and some of those safeguards
are important,

573
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:01,276
considering the risks we take.

574
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,756
It doesn't explain
why he gets a pass

575
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,105
on being a complete monster.

576
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:05,628
He doesn't get a pass.

577
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:08,152
He gets POBOR.
Peace Officer Bill Of Rights.

578
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:10,633
And he gets a union
and a legal defense team.

579
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,722
If he gets fired,
he gets to appeal.

580
00:22:12,766 --> 00:22:14,637
If he gets convicted,
he gets to appeal.

581
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:17,118
And those lawyers,
which our union dues pay for,

582
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:20,077
will tear apart every detail
surrounding his termination.

583
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:21,601
If they find one thing
out of order

584
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:23,037
or it just seems excessive,

585
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,734
he gets his job back,
including back pay.

586
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,910
And then --He gets emboldened,

587
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:28,085
with a huge chip
on his shoulder,

588
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:30,131
and that negative attitude
is contagious.

589
00:22:30,174 --> 00:22:32,525
The weight of this shouldn't
all fall on Jackson.

590
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:33,917
There's got to be more we can do

591
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:35,528
than just be guardian angels
out there,

592
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:38,095
hoping that we get to Jackson
in time if something goes wrong.

593
00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:40,141
It's...

594
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:52,283
We got a body
in a bag found near LAX.

595
00:22:52,327 --> 00:22:54,285
No head, no hands, no witnesses.

596
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:55,809
No problem. I'm on it, Sarge.

597
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:58,507
Actually,
this one's gonna go to Vargas.

598
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,117
But I'm next in the rotation.

599
00:23:00,161 --> 00:23:01,989
Under my discretion.
Is there a problem?

600
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:02,946
No, sir.

601
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,087
Does Sarge give a lot of cases
out of rotation?

602
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,741
Almost never.

603
00:23:31,932 --> 00:23:33,847
Hello?

604
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,458
<i>Nolan, are you some kind of con man?</i>

605
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:39,940
What? <i> You talked my wife
into finding her eureka moment,</i>

606
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,115
<i>then your mother swooped in
for the kill?</i>

607
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:42,421
Wait, I'm sorry.

608
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:45,032
My mom sold Luna
a bottle of CBD oil?

609
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:48,905
<i>Not</i> a <i>bottle, all the bottles.</i>

610
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:52,605
<i>My wife paid your mother
$10,000 for her franchise.</i>

611
00:23:52,648 --> 00:23:54,041
Mom.

612
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:55,651
You are giving Luna
her money back.

613
00:23:55,695 --> 00:23:57,348
Yeah, well,
that's not gonna happen.

614
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:58,959
Besides,
she doesn't want it back.

615
00:23:59,002 --> 00:24:00,264
She's happy with her purchase.

616
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:02,266
This is my boss' wife.

617
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,355
Do you have any idea what this
could do to my career?

618
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:06,270
This has nothing to do with you,
honey,

619
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:07,924
or your precious career.

620
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:09,796
Luna and I got to talking.

621
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,146
She liked my business,
and so I sold it to her.

622
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,496
For 10 grand? I wanted 25,

623
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,455
but she's a hell
of a negotiator.

624
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,674
This is just like back home
with my construction business.

625
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,807
Oh, there you go
with that old chestnut again.

626
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,678
I-I would finish a job,
and then you would use

627
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:23,940
my good name
to sell my customers

628
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,420
fraudulent
home insurance policies.

629
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,291
Oh, will you please
just let that go?

630
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:29,206
I almost lost
my business license.

631
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,993
This is the problem with men,
you and that Sergeant Grey.

632
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:34,473
What are you talking about?

633
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:37,911
You look down on women.

634
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:40,870
Luna is
an excellent salesperson.

635
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:43,177
You watch. She's gonna double
her investment.

636
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,222
Mother, I'm begging you...

637
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:48,617
for me, please,
give Luna her money back.

638
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:51,098
It isn't her money. It's mine.

639
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,060
That crap your mom sold me
is poison.

640
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:58,975
Take a look at this thing
on my neck.

641
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:01,108
Oh, Smitty, you should get
that mole checked.

642
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:02,718
No, not the mole.
I've always had that.

643
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:05,068
Below that.

644
00:25:05,112 --> 00:25:06,896
Yeah. And I'm not the only one.

645
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:19,518
Sir, Mrs. Grey, I'm so sorry.

646
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,389
John, no need to apologize.

647
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:23,739
My husband needs to.

648
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:30,529
Officer Nolan...

649
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:34,663
I'm sorry for accusing you and
your mom of scamming my wife.

650
00:25:34,707 --> 00:25:38,101
Luna's assured me that CBD
is a growth market

651
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:40,277
and she's guaranteed to make
money on this stuff, so --

652
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,583
N-No! That's toxic!

653
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,324
It's what? Toxic?

654
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,195
Uh, cops are breaking out into
rashes all over the department.

655
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:46,936
Your mother sold me snake oil?

656
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,982
Yes. But I don't think
that she knew that she did --

657
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:50,636
at least I-I hope she didn't.

658
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:52,899
What'd I tell you? I'm
sitting on $10,000 worth

659
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:55,466
of skin irritants. I can fix this
in one phone call --

660
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,164
Mom?

661
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,948
The CBD oil is toxic.

662
00:25:58,992 --> 00:26:00,602
You have to give Luna
her money back.

663
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:02,169
I'm with Sergeant G-

664
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:04,519
Hello? Hello?

665
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,218
Two phone calls, and...

666
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:09,872
So, what are we doing here?

667
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,657
Doug mentioned
his last rookie was Black,

668
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,484
so I thought he might be
inclined to give us

669
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:15,791
some dirt on his old T.O.,
something actionable.

670
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:16,923
That's great. Who is he?

671
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:19,882
Ben Owens.
And he's right on time.

672
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:22,493
Now, look, I don't know this
guy, so we can't tip our hand.

673
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:24,539
Alright, we make no accusations
and no demands.

674
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,497
Understood? No accusations, no demands.

675
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,325
I got it.

676
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:29,762
Officer Owens?

677
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:31,285
I'm Bradford, this is Chen.

678
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:33,113
Thanks for agreeing to meet up.

679
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:35,768
No problem. Asked around,
heard you're good people.

680
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:37,378
So, what's up? I need some insight,

681
00:26:37,421 --> 00:26:38,858
but on the DL
if you know what I mean.

682
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:40,686
Ten-thirty-six.

683
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:42,513
Code of silence. Talk to me.

684
00:26:42,557 --> 00:26:44,080
Doug Stanton. He was your T.O.

685
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:46,648
The Dougernaut. What about him?

686
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:49,608
You ever see him doing
anything shady?

687
00:26:49,651 --> 00:26:52,132
Relax. Um... we were
just wondering

688
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,699
if you liked the way
he does business.

689
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:55,788
No. No way. He's a hater.

690
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:57,267
But what do you really want
to know?

691
00:26:57,311 --> 00:27:00,140
Whatever you feel comfortable
sharing with us.

692
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:02,142
It's -- This is stupid.

693
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:03,578
We all know
what we're talking about.

694
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,058
Do you think Doug is a racist?

695
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:07,364
Have you ever seen him
treat minorities unfairly?

696
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:08,801
If I saw something
outside of policy

697
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:10,672
and I failed to report it,

698
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:12,587
I'd be looking
at disciplinary action, too.

699
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,850
We're not here for that, okay?
Just be real with us.

700
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:17,723
He's creating some grief
on our end.

701
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:19,159
Hey, you got a good rep and all,

702
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:21,030
but I don't know you.

703
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,119
I do know Doug Stanton,
and I am well aware

704
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:25,034
of what he can do to me
and my career.

705
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:27,036
Yeah, what about what he's doing
to civilians out on the street?

706
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,651
I'm weeks away
from joining Metro.

707
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,783
I can do more good in that unit

708
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:37,264
than I can
by throwing it all away.

709
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,527
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

710
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,398
You have a good day.

711
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,183
Well, that was a bust.

712
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:44,358
No, it wasn't.

713
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:47,013
Did you see him?
How conflicted he was?

714
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,405
We just got to give him time.
Trust me.

715
00:27:48,449 --> 00:27:50,407
My mother is claiming

716
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,192
your money is tied up
in other investments,

717
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:53,802
but I have the address
of the supplier.

718
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:55,021
I'll get your refund.

719
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:56,022
Forget it. I'll handle it.

720
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,501
No. I will.

721
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,982
You two can tag along.

722
00:28:00,026 --> 00:28:03,856
Fine. Nolan and I can't handle
a personal matter in uniform,

723
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,118
so let's go change out.

724
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:06,641
You can listen to me brainstorm

725
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,816
on how I'm going to punish you.

726
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,731
Wade, it is not his fault.

727
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:11,124
Punishing him
for his mother's behavior

728
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,343
would be like punishing me
for my dad's.

729
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:17,870
I see your point.

730
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:19,262
I'll find Harper,
tell her you're riding

731
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:20,916
with me this morning. Yes, sir.

732
00:28:23,571 --> 00:28:25,051
Thank you for that.

733
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:27,836
I'm guessing your dad
was a bit of a scammer, too?

734
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,708
Alcoholic.

735
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,927
It's brought me
a lifetime of pain.

736
00:28:31,971 --> 00:28:33,929
Almost broke up my marriage.

737
00:28:33,973 --> 00:28:36,366
So what are you supposed to do
when someone you love is --

738
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,108
is ruining your life but you
don't know how to help them?

739
00:28:39,152 --> 00:28:41,894
I know what I had to do.
But I'm not you.

740
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:43,765
And my father isn't your mother.

741
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:46,550
However, you did offer me
some advice,

742
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:49,379
so I will return the favor.

743
00:28:49,423 --> 00:28:51,512
Find your limits, John.

744
00:28:51,555 --> 00:28:54,297
We can't change their behavior.
They have to want it.

745
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:58,911
So be honest, be merciful,

746
00:28:58,954 --> 00:29:01,783
and do whatever you have to do
to protect yourself.

747
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:14,753
'Sup, my brotha?

748
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,886
You sure?

749
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,714
Thanks for the heads-up.

750
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,759
Everything okay?

751
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,630
We're about to find out.

752
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,371
Just got a tip.
Let's go see if it's real.

753
00:29:32,596 --> 00:29:33,815
Control, 7-Adam-07.

754
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,599
I have an on-view
eleven-three deal

755
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:38,080
in alley
between Lomita and Vineyard.

756
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,651
Follow the backpack!

757
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:45,044
7-Adam-07, foot pursuit!

758
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:47,089
Male, adult, Black,
blue shirt, black jeans!

759
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:52,921
We're not close. Then punch it.

760
00:29:55,097 --> 00:29:56,185
There!

761
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:02,757
Police! Don't make me kill you!

762
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,237
I-I got it! I got it. I got it.

763
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:12,723
Damn it.
Jackson, I lost my body camera.

764
00:30:12,767 --> 00:30:14,900
You seen it? No.

765
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:17,990
But what I do see is a lousy
attempt at hiding evidence.

766
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,861
Like I can't get someone
down there to get that.

767
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:21,994
What's your name, dumbass? Ask your mama.

768
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,473
She was screaming it
all last night.

769
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,608
You and me are gonna have
a lesson in respect.

770
00:30:27,651 --> 00:30:30,611
Teach your mama some respect.
Get that ho off the streets.

771
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:32,874
Look -- Mm!

772
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:35,964
Officer West,
preserve the evidence.

773
00:30:36,008 --> 00:30:37,531
I'm gonna take our friend
back to the shop.

774
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:38,749
I-I can take him, sir.

775
00:30:38,793 --> 00:30:40,577
No. I got it.

776
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:41,883
You stay here.

777
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:44,059
Come on. Let's go, son.

778
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:55,114
<i>You've reached Sergeant Grey</i>

779
00:30:55,157 --> 00:30:57,333
<i>of LAPD's Mid-Wilshire Station.</i>

780
00:30:57,377 --> 00:30:58,334
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

781
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:00,162
Sarge, it's -- it's Jackson.

782
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:02,512
Look, I-I think Doug's about to
beat the crap out of a suspect,

783
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:05,167
and he lost his body cam,
so there won't be a record.

784
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:23,925
Found my body cam.

785
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:25,927
More importantly,
what are you doing here?

786
00:31:25,971 --> 00:31:27,581
Told you to guard the drugs.

787
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:29,800
Uh... I don't remember
calling for backup.

788
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:32,107
We were in the
neighborhood. What's going on?

789
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:34,240
Well, this rookie doesn't know
how to follow orders.

790
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:36,764
Yeah, I-I was just, um...

791
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:40,028
making sure you were alright,
sir.

792
00:31:40,072 --> 00:31:42,465
You know, my last rookie
did everything I told him to.

793
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:44,076
Guy's name was Owens.

794
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,599
You know him?

795
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:47,949
Always had my back.

796
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:49,864
Still does.

797
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,953
Too bad Jackson
isn't more like him.

798
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,050
Since when do you drink decaf?

799
00:32:02,094 --> 00:32:03,791
I know when I made detective,

800
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,054
I was drinking like two quarts
of hi-test a day.

801
00:32:08,535 --> 00:32:10,711
Everything okay? Yeah.

802
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:15,150
No, not really.

803
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:16,282
I'm getting sidelined.

804
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:18,284
Why?

805
00:32:18,327 --> 00:32:19,938
This stays between us?

806
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:23,115
I'm pregnant.

807
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,986
Wh-- That's -- That's amazing.

808
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,988
Congratulations. Wait.

809
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:28,511
Wait, Caradine can't bench you
for that.

810
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:30,078
Technically, no.

811
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:33,168
Just assigning the good cases
to the non-preggers.

812
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:36,780
Bastard. That is exactly why
I hid my pregnancy.

813
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:39,740
I banked my vacation and
took the last two months off.

814
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:41,611
It's not fair.
No one ever asks a man

815
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:44,919
how he's gonna balance being a
dad and a cop at the same time.

816
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,053
Oh, I know.

817
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:50,446
Did you have to get
an amniocentesis?

818
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,971
Is that the long needle
in the belly thing?

819
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:55,321
No. Why? Do you have to?

820
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:57,453
Yeah.

821
00:32:57,497 --> 00:32:59,978
And the messed-up part is

822
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:03,894
even if the mutated gene
we're afraid of is detected,

823
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:06,636
we won't know if my baby's
affected until...

824
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,117
it's born.

825
00:33:09,161 --> 00:33:11,990
I thought being a mom
was gonna be so simple.

826
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,643
Hmm.

827
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:16,864
Does it get easier? Uh, it hasn't yet,

828
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:19,432
but if it ever does,
you are my first phone call.

829
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,354
Ugh.

830
00:33:28,397 --> 00:33:30,747
I'm getting a rash
just being in here.

831
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:32,227
No wonder the oil's toxic.

832
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:38,364
Yeah.
This feels like my mom's style.

833
00:33:43,238 --> 00:33:45,197
Good afternoon.

834
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,373
What do you want? Direct. I-I like it.

835
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:51,464
You recently sold 20 cases
of Professor Hempstein's CBD oil

836
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:53,596
to my business partner,
Evelyn Nolan.

837
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,991
The product is defective,
and I would like a refund.

838
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,645
No refunds. Get lost.

839
00:33:58,688 --> 00:34:00,386
Listen, man --I appreciate that.

840
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:03,345
But if we leave
without recompense,

841
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:05,739
I will be forced to alert
the Health Department

842
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:07,219
and the Better Business Bureau.

843
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,351
Knock yourself out.
Just don't do it from here.

844
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:12,093
If I may?

845
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:15,096
My friend, you really don't
want to make this a thing.

846
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,099
This stuff will take the paint
off your car.

847
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:20,536
Once that gets out,
your business will dry up.

848
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,668
Just give her
the 10 grand back --

849
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:25,193
10? That crap only cost two.

850
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:27,587
Pretty hefty franchise fee
your mom charged us.

851
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,632
Your mom?

852
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:32,505
I-I know. Just... don't start.

853
00:34:32,548 --> 00:34:34,942
She's good for it, okay?
Or -- Or at least I am.

854
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:37,423
Look, don't be an ass
and give me the money back.

855
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:39,033
Get the hell outta here.

856
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,426
And next time, bring some muscle

857
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:42,993
that's not past
its expiration date.

858
00:34:43,037 --> 00:34:46,606
You hear that, Officer Nolan?
He thinks we're old.

859
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:48,129
Yes, I did, Sergeant Grey.

860
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:50,653
Though I prefer to think
of myself as "well-seasoned."

861
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:54,527
Luna, why don't you go
wait downstairs, baby?

862
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,877
Yeah, we'll let the lawyers
straighten this out.

863
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,010
These guys aren't worth
the trouble.

864
00:35:00,054 --> 00:35:03,101
There ain't gonna be no trouble,
right, son?

865
00:35:08,628 --> 00:35:10,847
I got the feeling...

866
00:35:10,891 --> 00:35:12,849
CBD isn't the only product
