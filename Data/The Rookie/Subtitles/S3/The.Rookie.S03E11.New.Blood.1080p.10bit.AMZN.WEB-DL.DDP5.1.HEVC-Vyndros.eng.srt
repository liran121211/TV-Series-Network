1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,963
There they are.

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,052
Ooh.
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

3
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:11,228
They got no idea
what's coming for them.

4
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:13,361
Please tell me we did not
look that nervous

5
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,450
our first day as rookies.

6
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:17,800
Alright. Let's go give them
a warm Mid-Wilshire welcome.

7
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:19,410
Hey. New recruits?

8
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:20,759
Welcome, guys. My name is --

9
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:22,413
John Nolan. Yeah. Hi.

10
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:23,501
Wow. It is such a pleasure

11
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:25,068
- to meet you.
- Wow.

12
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:26,461
You were my inspiration for
coming into the department.

13
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:27,940
And when I think about
six months ago,

14
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:30,334
I-I was data auditing
the AP matrix

15
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:31,770
in the IT department.

16
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:33,163
Well, thank you for saying that.

17
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:34,251
We're very happy to have you.

18
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:35,818
Uh, I'm Lucy,
and this is Jackson.

19
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:37,080
Hey.
Welcome to Mid-Wilshire.
Hey.

20
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:38,560
Are you rookies, too?

21
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:39,778
- Not anymore.
- We're --

22
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:41,780
W-Well, <i> we're</i> actually P2s.

23
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:44,000
While I selflessly
held myself back

24
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,567
so that you guys could
get your bearings.

25
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,395
Come on.

26
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:48,613
Do you know
who your T.O. is yet?

27
00:00:48,657 --> 00:00:50,833
I think his name is Bradford.

28
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:52,661
Oh, he was my T.O. He's great.

29
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:55,794
You will learn so much.

30
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,144
But?

31
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:58,971
He can be intense.
But don't worry.

32
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:00,799
If you find yourself
in a self-doubt spiral,

33
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:02,845
I'm always around. Thank you.

34
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:03,889
Rookies sit in front row.

35
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:05,239
This way.

36
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:07,110
Right here? Yeah. Plant her.

37
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:08,416
Thank you. You betcha.

38
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,808
Sorry about that.

39
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,290
How much did you
have to bribe Grey

40
00:01:13,334 --> 00:01:15,727
to not give you
Bizarro World Nolan?

41
00:01:15,771 --> 00:01:17,294
As a training officer
in the LAPD,

42
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,382
it is my duty to train

43
00:01:18,426 --> 00:01:21,037
any and all recruits
assigned to me.

44
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,560
Two pairs
-of Lakers tickets.
-Mm-hmm.

45
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:24,127
Alright. Settle in.

46
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:25,955
We got some new blood today.

47
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:28,088
Stand up
so everyone can see you.

48
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:33,571
You earned the right
to be in this room,

49
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,443
but you have to prove
yourselves to stay.

50
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,053
The way we do things matters.

51
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,142
Tradition and protocol
are the metal

52
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:41,666
from which every cop
in this city is forged.

53
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,538
That being said,
it's my pleasure

54
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:45,757
to welcome you
to the FTO program.

55
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,324
State your name
and badge numbers.

56
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:48,673
Barnes, Katie.

57
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:50,936
Badge number 44313.

58
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,852
Uh, hi. I'm Larry Macer.

59
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:55,463
Uh, everybody calls me
"The Badger" --

60
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,596
- Oh!
- Oh, geez.

61
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,468
- Come on.
- Oh, my gosh.

62
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:08,563
Badger.

63
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:10,304
My office. <i>Now.</i>

64
00:02:10,347 --> 00:02:14,395
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
whoa, oh, oh ♪

65
00:02:14,438 --> 00:02:20,183

66
00:02:20,227 --> 00:02:22,751
Washing out at roll call
on your first day?

67
00:02:22,794 --> 00:02:24,187
That has gotta be a record.

68
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:26,189
I heard about a recruit who
ran over his captain

69
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,757
driving into the parking lot.

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,802
But I'm sure it's an urban myth.

71
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:32,935
Watch your head.

72
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:34,458
Dad!

73
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,158
Henry! I had no i--
This is amazing.

74
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:39,985
This is --
This -- This is awesome.

75
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:42,423
Hey, buddy! I didn't know
I was gonna see you today.

76
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,512
Oh, that's why we're here.
We just wanted to say hello.

77
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:46,601
Oh, that's great.
Uh, you remember my son, Henry,

78
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:48,124
his lovely fiancée, Abigail. Hi.

79
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,386
It's good to see you.

80
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,735
You guys just flew in
this morning?

81
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:52,172
We drove, actually.

82
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,738
From my mom's new place
in Arizona.

83
00:02:53,782 --> 00:02:55,218
We helped her get moved in.

84
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:56,959
Yeah, the road trip was
a little us time

85
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,221
before Henry starts the new job.

86
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:00,136
Oh, that's right.
Congratulations.

87
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,269
What exactly will you
be doing again?

88
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:05,272
Uh, Henry is
the new youth liaison

89
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:07,883
for, uh, Ben's new nonprofit,

90
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:09,319
uh, clean water foundation.

91
00:03:09,363 --> 00:03:10,277
You don't know
what that means, do you?

92
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,234
Not really, no.

93
00:03:11,278 --> 00:03:12,366
I'll be traveling the world,

94
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:13,671
connecting with youth activists

95
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:15,934
to build partnerships
between the nonprofit

96
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:18,285
and the communities
they serve. That --

97
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:20,939
<i>And</i> promoting it all
on social media.

98
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:23,464
That's why Ben needed to hire
somebody young and hip.

99
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:24,726
That's right.
- Yeah.

100
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:26,075
So when am I gonna
see you guys tonight?

101
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:28,208
You won't.
We're staying in Malibu.
Oh.

102
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,687
Henry has an early session
tomorrow,

103
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:31,211
so the company got us
a hotel room.

104
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,516
I totally get it.

105
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,778
L.A. traffic, all that.
Don't worry.

106
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,084
Text me if anything changes.

107
00:03:35,127 --> 00:03:36,477
Will do. Have a safe shift.

108
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,087
You bet.
Have a great first day training.

109
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,870
- Thank you.
- Bye, guys.

110
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,655
Later, guys. Bye.

111
00:03:40,698 --> 00:03:41,830
Knock 'em dead.

112
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:45,094
Oh, it's killing him
to be so supportive.

113
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:46,617
It's killing me
to be so supportive.

114
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:48,010
Think he can tell?

115
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:48,837
Not at all.

116
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,840
I will. I will.

117
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,624
Bye.

118
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:54,756
That was my mother.

119
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,932
Is she still mad about the cake?

120
00:03:56,975 --> 00:03:59,282
Patrice doesn't do mad,
she does disappointed.

121
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,415
- Fewer wrinkles.
- So, what did she say?

122
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,546
I had told her that we were

123
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,808
having a hard time
finding a venue,

124
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,506
so she called her country club.

125
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,335
That club where that asshat
asked me for a clean fork?

126
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,988
That's the one.

127
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:12,121
And they had an opening,
so she booked it.

128
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,949
Without asking us?

129
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:16,299
Why would she?
It's only our wedding.

130
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:18,910
I'm not getting married
at that country club.
Agreed.

131
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:20,477
So, which one of us
is gonna tell her?

132
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,305
Um...

133
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,047
Tim.

134
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,614
Hey. You got a minute?

135
00:04:26,657 --> 00:04:27,963
Professor Ryan. Come in.

136
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:30,226
Isn't our sit-down scheduled
for next week?

137
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,662
This is about
something different.

138
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,142
What's going on?

139
00:04:33,185 --> 00:04:34,361
For over a week now,

140
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:36,493
somebody has been
leaving notes on my car.

141
00:04:36,537 --> 00:04:40,454
At home, at work,
the market, dry cleaners.

142
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:42,325
Now, the notes are creepy,

143
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:44,675
but they are <i>not threatening,</i>

144
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:45,937
which is smart, because --

145
00:04:45,981 --> 00:04:47,765
Because without
credible threats,

146
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,898
there's no crime. Exactly.

147
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,334
It's just enough
to send a message --

148
00:04:51,378 --> 00:04:52,814
"I'm watching you."

149
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:55,599
But this morning,
I found my car window smashed,

150
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:58,298
and, uh, this was inside.

151
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:01,910
Whoever is behind this,
he or she is escalating.

152
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,390
Is there anyone you can think of

153
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:04,652
that could do
something like this?

154
00:05:04,695 --> 00:05:06,958
I'm one of the faces
behind a loud

155
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:08,482
criminal justice
reform movement.

156
00:05:08,525 --> 00:05:11,659
I'm all over social media,
cable news.

157
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:14,096
And a lot of people do not like
what I have to say.

158
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,228
Does anyone know what you drive,
where you live?

159
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:17,229
No, no.

160
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:18,796
I've worked very hard
to make sure

161
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,363
that that is not
public information.

162
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:21,669
What's your schedule today?

163
00:05:21,712 --> 00:05:24,411
Uh, well, I have yoga at 11:00,

164
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:25,368
and then, uh...

165
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:26,717
teaching tonight.

166
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,328
Let's get a report written up,

167
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,330
and I will assign
Nolan and Harper

168
00:05:30,373 --> 00:05:31,809
to patrol the areas
you'll be in today.

169
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:33,245
Thank you, Sergeant.

170
00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:34,377
After you.

171
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,770
This is a shop.

172
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:38,163
It's not a cop car, squad car,
or black-and-white.

173
00:05:38,207 --> 00:05:40,470
It's a shop.
It's where you work.

174
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:43,168
First, we examine
the exterior for damage.

175
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:45,388
Any nicks, scratches,
dents, or dings,

176
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:46,433
you write 'em up.

177
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:47,825
Got it? Sir.

178
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,436
Load the war bags, Boot.

179
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:55,659
Shotgun safety check.

180
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:57,618
Verify it's empty, safety on,

181
00:05:57,661 --> 00:05:58,923
load it, close the action.

182
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,012
Remington 870.

183
00:06:01,056 --> 00:06:03,624
Three-inch magnum,
ghost-ring sights,

184
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,886
six-round magazine tube,

185
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:06,888
steel receiver
with a polymer over-mold.

186
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:12,372
Sir, if it's all right with you,

187
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:13,547
I prefer to keep
one in the chamber.

188
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,767
That extra half-second counts.

189
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:18,465
There's only three reasons
a person would be

190
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:20,031
that familiar with this weapon.

191
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:21,468
You a big-game hunter, Boot?

192
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:23,252
Negative, sir.

193
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:25,167
Don't destroy anything unless
it needs to be destroyed.

194
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,995
Relatives in law enforcement?

195
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:28,431
Negative, sir.
First in my family.

196
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:30,128
Former military, then.

197
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:31,608
Hm.

198
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,654
But standard issue is
an M4 carbine.

199
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,438
If you were in country,
using a shotgun --

200
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,005
I was a breacher.

201
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:39,137
82nd Airborne,
2nd Brigade Combat Team.

202
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:40,791
Advance team and combat patrol.

203
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,793
80-deuce. "All the way"...

204
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,099
sir.

205
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:45,666
Alright.

206
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,755
Some new ground rules, then.

207
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,365
You don't have to call me "sir."

208
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,933
It'll be an adjustment,
but you're gonna be fine.

209
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,588
Wanna get a coffee?

210
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,765
Stop. It's not a big deal.

211
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,897
Yes, it is. You're turning 18.

212
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:01,508
You're finally getting
your own place.

213
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:03,248
Come on. This is exciting.

214
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,772
Yeah, my first solo apartment,

215
00:07:04,815 --> 00:07:05,729
you could literally
reach the stove

216
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:06,904
without getting out of bed.

217
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:09,167
In my first place,
I eventually stopped

218
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,517
fighting with the cockroaches,

219
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,996
and I just treated them as pets.

220
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,129
But I'm sure yours will be
much nicer than that.

221
00:07:14,172 --> 00:07:17,132

complain about

Hey.

256
00:08:29,552 --> 00:08:31,032
What are you doing
in my neck of the woods?

257
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:32,903
James!

258
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:35,471
Uh, just a little covert
undercover police work.

259
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,953
Ohhh, staking out
the yoga studio, huh?

260
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,303
Always had a bad feeling
about that place.

261
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,523
No one should be that happy
after exercise.

262
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,828
How's the Community Center
going?

263
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:46,787
Swimming upstream every day.

264
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,702
I'm trying to get this
self-defense class going,

265
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:50,834
but I just lost my instructor.

266
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,793
Well, Detective Harper
is an expert

267
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:55,491
at hand-to-hand combat,
and a phenomenal teacher.

268
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,101
Really?

269
00:08:57,145 --> 00:09:00,322
Ah, but I-I'm -- I'm sure
you have plans tonight.

270
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:04,587
Uh, I-I could probably swing by
for an hour or so.

271
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,676
That'd be awesome. Thank you.

272
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,591
Harper.

273
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:09,723
I'm gonna hold you to that.

274
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,253
Looks like we're on.

275
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:28,916
What are you doing?

276
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,396
Uh, just taking some pictures.

277
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,268
I'm on public property.

278
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:34,922
Pictures of what?

279
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,271
Birds.

280
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,360
What's going on?

281
00:09:38,403 --> 00:09:40,101
This gentleman was
taking photos of you.

282
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:41,668
Is that true?

283
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:43,321
Wait a minute. I know you.

284
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:45,106
You were in one of my classes.

285
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,195
Your Torts class, two years ago.

286
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:48,544
I-I sat in the front row.

287
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,067
I came to all your office hours.

288
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,765
So you just happened to be
photographing birds

289
00:09:51,808 --> 00:09:53,288
in front of her yoga class?

290
00:09:53,331 --> 00:09:55,203
Wild, right? It feels like fate.

291
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:56,596
No, it feels like stalking.

292
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:57,945
Did you break into
Professor Ryan's car

293
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,207
this morning? No.

294
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,208
Give me your camera.

295
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:01,775
- Don't.
- Don't.

296
00:10:01,818 --> 00:10:02,732
Why?

297
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,081
It's an unreasonable search.

298
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,343
Uh, no.

299
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:07,694
This is evidence
that can be easily deleted.

300
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:09,652
So we have the right
to examine it.

301
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,175
I disagree. You need a warrant.

302
00:10:11,219 --> 00:10:12,524
He has rights.

303
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:13,830
Thank you, Fiona.

304
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:15,136
Well, don't take it personally.

305
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:16,703
- The law is the law.
- Alright, fine.

306
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:17,965
We will get a warrant.

307
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,531
But we have the right
to detain him

308
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:20,445
while we are waiting for it.

309
00:10:20,489 --> 00:10:22,534
So I'm gonna do that.

310
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:24,928
Put your camera in your bag
and your hands behind your back.

311
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:29,193
So, he's been stalking you?

312
00:10:29,237 --> 00:10:31,021
Somebody has.

313
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,675
Oh, sorry.
James, this is Fiona --

314
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:33,763
Ryan. Yeah, I know.

315
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:35,417
I follow you on social media.

316
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,724
Yes, I follow you, too.

317
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:39,595
You're doing some
really important work
in this neighborhood.

318
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,205
Thank you.

319
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:42,903
Hey, if you ever need
a civil rights litigator,

320
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:44,992
please give me a call.

321
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:47,995
Wow. I hope you mean that,
because I will.

322
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:49,300
Anytime.

323
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:50,867
Tell Nyla I'll text her
the details for tonight.

324
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,216
Will do.

325
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,740
You're all right following us
to the station?

326
00:10:53,783 --> 00:10:55,350
Yeah. And...

327
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:56,481
you're okay, right?

328
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,135
Of course. Okay.

329
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,836
I heard you were
a real hard-ass.

330
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,752
Random tests,
getting into people's heads.

331
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:07,623
Why not with me?
Or is this part of it?

332
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,799
You're messing with me
right now, aren't you?

333
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:12,672
Well, yes and no. Okay, then.

334
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:14,238
How am I doing?

335
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,371
Fine so far.

336
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:18,982
You'll have some challenges,
but you'll push through 'em.

337
00:11:19,026 --> 00:11:20,157
What kinds of challenges?

338
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:22,029
People with strong
military backgrounds

339
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:24,379
can struggle with
the transition to being a cop.

340
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:26,076
That won't be me.

341
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,426
I've been on combat patrol,
doing exactly this.

342
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,211
Wrong.

343
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:32,648
There are three major
differences between
police and military,

344
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,737
and if you want to be a cop
instead of a soldier,

345
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,304
you'll have to conquer
all of them.

346
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:38,132
Tell me.

347
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:40,482
One, cops are expected
to be proactive.

348
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,092
You don't wait for orders.

349
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,878
Two, you are no longer bound
by military objectives.

350
00:11:44,921 --> 00:11:46,793
The actions you take are
up to your discretion.

351
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:49,447
And, three, the people
we come up against on the street

352
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:51,275
aren't enemy combatants.

353
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:53,408
They're our fellow citizens.

354
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:55,758
<i>7-Adam-19, clear for traffic?</i>

355
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:58,892
7-Adam-19, go ahead.

356
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:02,069
<i>Silent alarm, 4-5-9 type with
multiple motion activations.</i>

357
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:05,072
<i>755 Bollinger Road. 7-Adam-19?</i>

358
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,682
4-5-9 with a silent alarm?

359
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,944
Burglary.

360
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:09,293
Most likely second degree,

361
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:10,599
entering a commercial structure

362
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:12,166
with the intent to commit theft,

363
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:15,082
grand theft, petty theft,
or any felony.

364
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:16,387
Good.

365
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:18,128
7-Adam-19, copy.

366
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:34,231
Negative on lookouts.

367
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,416
Want me to post
on the side door,

368
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,809
and you can recon the front?

369
00:12:46,853 --> 00:12:48,115
Sounds good.
Just stay to the left of --

370
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:50,508
The door. Visible hinges.

371
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,597
Outward-opening door puts
the kill zone on the right.

372
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:54,469
Okay. If I see suspects inside,
what do we do?

373
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:55,775
Call for reinforcements.

374
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:57,124
You mean, call for <i>backup.</i>

375
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,430
Yes, sir. I meant backup.

376
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:00,823
Then we can surround
and call out,

377
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:02,782
or make entry and engage.

378
00:13:02,825 --> 00:13:04,958
What would <i>you</i> do?

379
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,873
Uh...

380
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,527
Why force confrontation?

381
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:11,878
Get air support on the roof,
and surround and call out.

382
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,227
Perfect.

383
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:18,275
Gun!

384
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:29,809
7-Adam-19. Shots fired.
Two armed suspects.

385
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,201
Requesting backup and airship.

386
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:43,126
Sir, I've got a shot. How?

387
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,215
Little ricochet trick
I picked up in Fallujah.

388
00:13:48,218 --> 00:13:50,438
Ugh! Aah!

389
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:04,191
Lay on your stomach.
Hands behind your back.

390
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,324
Are they gonna find anyone else
in the building?

391
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:08,848
No. Don't lie to me.

392
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,501
Barnes, suspect's secured.

393
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:12,242
Our job is now
to render first aid.

394
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:13,591
Sorry.

395
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:14,854
Sorry, right.

396
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,077
- You trained for this?
- Yes, sir.

397
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,694
-What the hell is that? What?

398
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:32,610
Tim put his hand
on her shoulder.

399
00:14:32,654 --> 00:14:34,612
Man, I saved his life
on my first day.

400
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,440
I didn't even get a fist bump.

401
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:46,407
So, it seems Andy Becker
got fixated on you

402
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,757
when you gave him an F
in your class.

403
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,890
He thought it was
to get his attention.

404
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,369
Everything since
has been the long game

405
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:53,501
to get you to fall in love
with him.

406
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:56,939
I know.

407
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:59,550
Did you find any evidence that
he broke into my car?

408
00:14:59,594 --> 00:15:01,988
No. He didn't take
-any pictures of that.
-Oh.

409
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:03,903
So he's a creep,
but there's no evidence

410
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,121
that he actually
committed any crimes?

411
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,383
Right.

412
00:15:08,603 --> 00:15:10,692
You think that I'm an idiot
for keeping you

413
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:12,128
from doing that search without
the warrant.

414
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,825
No.

415
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,610
Y-You've dedicated your life

416
00:15:15,653 --> 00:15:16,872
to protecting civil liberties.

417
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,092
If anything,
I-I respect you more

418
00:15:19,135 --> 00:15:21,181
for sticking to it
when it's this personal.

419
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,052
Now, I did put an emergency
restraining order on him.

420
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,271
Hopefully,
he'll get the message.

421
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,186
Thank you.

422
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,144
- See you in class?
- I'll be there.

423
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:36,196
What are we doing here?

424
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,894
You'll see.

425
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,330
You were right.

426
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:41,766
About earlier.

427
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,986
That was different
than the Army.

428
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,292
One second,
a guy's trying to kill us.

429
00:15:45,335 --> 00:15:48,121
The next, we're saving his life.

430
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:49,774
You're still in
the headspace where

431
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:52,603
everyone is either a friendly
or an enemy combatant.

432
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:55,345
It's my job to help you change
that mind-set.

433
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:58,783
These people are all
your neighbors.

434
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:00,611
Now, some are neighbors
with problems

435
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:03,745
who do stupid things,
crazy things, selfish things,

436
00:16:03,788 --> 00:16:06,008
but they're just people.

437
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:09,664
I want you
to take a look around.

438
00:16:09,707 --> 00:16:11,231
What do you see?

439
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,146
Ah. Finally getting a Tim Test?

440
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,280
We passed six people
on our way in.

441
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:19,152
Four males, two females.

442
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:21,502
There's one ingress
and egress road.

443
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:24,157
The hillside to our back
gives us a tactical advantage.

444
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,028
That's well-spotted.

445
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:27,595
But I want you to be
in the present,

446
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,858
not thinking about
potential threats.

447
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,785
What do you see here?

448
00:16:43,828 --> 00:16:45,743
Uh...

449
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:47,354
A ladybug.

450
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:50,748
It's... very cute, sir.

451
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,359
No.

452
00:16:52,402 --> 00:16:53,142
It's adorable.

453
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,406
You see the tiny spots?

454
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,104
Focus on them.

455
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:01,150
Focus on them.

456
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:03,326
I want you to take
a deep breath.

457
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,112
Feel the sun.

458
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,244
Go ahead. Close your eyes.

459
00:17:08,288 --> 00:17:09,637
I'll cover you.

460
00:17:19,255 --> 00:17:21,736
<i>This</i> is your present.

461
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,912
You made it home.

462
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:26,306
Life is good.

463
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:30,005
You're safe.

464
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,443
When you're in country,
everything's hostile.

465
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:36,751
You never turn it off,
you only turn it down.

466
00:17:36,794 --> 00:17:39,667
Cops who are fearful,
they use officer safety

467
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,147
as a way of treating everyone
like the enemy.

468
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,539
But they're not.

469
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,281
In fact, you're doing the job
wrong if you are.

470
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:48,328
I don't know how to live
like that anymore.

471
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,938
You'll remember.

472
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,244
Just give it time.

473
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,594
Be in the moment.

474
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:54,769
That's it?

475
00:17:54,812 --> 00:17:57,511
It's harder than you think.

476
00:17:57,554 --> 00:17:59,339
At least it was for me.

477
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:02,342
But it's only way I could
leave the war behind.

478
00:18:10,741 --> 00:18:12,221
You don't have to wait for me.

479
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:13,570
I know.

480
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,573
So, you ready for the exam
next week?

481
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,184
Uh, I <i>will</i> be ready.

482
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:21,796
Sorry. Hold on a second.

483
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,408
Hello?

484
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:27,018
What -- Who is this?

485
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:29,151
How dare you say that to me!

486
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,761
Who was that?

487
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:35,375
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

488
00:18:35,418 --> 00:18:37,203
What's wrong?

489
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:39,335
Someone just posted
my home address,

490
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:40,597
my phone number,

491
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:42,556
and my license plate
to the Internet,

492
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,645
with a message reading,

493
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:47,126
"Come teach this bitch
a lesson."

494
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,436
Okay. Thank you.
I'll let her know.

495
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,655
That was the Assaults Unit.

496
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:56,222
They handle the criminal threats
like this.

497
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:57,614
Along with
the Cyber Crimes Division,

498
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:59,355
they're gonna track down
the original post.

499
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:00,661
Well, thank you,

500
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:03,142
but my information's
all out there now forever,

501
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:06,536
so there's no putting that horse
back in the barn.

502
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,756
Well, my gut tells me
it's your stalker, Andy.

503
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,888
He got pissed about
that restraining order

504
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:12,847
and put your address online

505
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,415
in hopes that some hate group
will try to do you harm

506
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,505
while he sits safely
on the sidelines watching.

507
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:20,855
Well, thank you
for walking with me.

508
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,987
Uh, knowing how this sounds,

509
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,119
how about I just
follow you home,

510
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,076
just to make sure it's safe?

511
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,730
I don't need a bodyguard.

512
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:28,558
All due respect, that's exactly
what you need right now.

513
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,865
No. That is exactly
what they want --

514
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:32,693
for me to be afraid.

515
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:35,217
I am not going
to give that to them.

516
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,219
But thank you for your help.

517
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:41,441
Good night.

518
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:46,402
Tamara, what's up?

519
00:19:46,446 --> 00:19:48,317
<i>Lucy, can you come get me?</i>

520
00:19:48,361 --> 00:19:49,927
Yeah. Where are you?</i>

521
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,233
<i>My cousin's.</i>

522
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:52,626
<i>He's been drinking.</i>

523
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:54,715
Tamara!</i>

524
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:55,977
Hey, I'll be right there.

525
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:03,637
Get the hell out now.

526
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,681
Just let me get my stuff.

527
00:20:04,725 --> 00:20:06,074
Consider it back rent.

528
00:20:06,117 --> 00:20:07,118
Where the hell
am I supposed to go?

529
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:08,250
Who cares?

530
00:20:08,294 --> 00:20:09,904
Been freeloading off me
long enough.

531
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:11,253
Okay, everyone take a breath.

532
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:12,254
Go get her stuff.

533
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:13,647
I said, go get her stuff!

534
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:20,262
Are you okay?

535
00:20:20,306 --> 00:20:22,395

00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,668
Yeah. You gonna yell
at me some more?

716
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:52,018
No. I brought you coffee.

717
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:53,672
Thank you.

718
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:05,771
Listen, I'm sorry
I snapped at you earlier.

719
00:28:05,814 --> 00:28:09,513
It's not a problem.
Very stressful situation.

720
00:28:09,557 --> 00:28:11,646
Thank you.

721
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,953
And thank you for staying.

722
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:16,172
It does make me feel better
knowing that you're here.

723
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:17,739
You're welcome, Professor.

724
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:19,045
Oh, please.

725
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,874
Considering what you're doing,
call me Fiona.

726
00:28:21,917 --> 00:28:23,658
Oh, sorry.

727
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,616
That's my son.

728
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:28,924
Everything okay?

729
00:28:28,968 --> 00:28:30,056
It's the last thing

730
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:31,840
you need to be hearing about
right now.

731
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:34,277
Actually, I could use
a distraction.

732
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:36,671
Okay. Um...

733
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,979
Uh, my son got a job
and dropped out of college.

734
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:42,111
But you wanted him to graduate
because you didn't?

735
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:44,244
I made a nice life for myself

736
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:46,072
and my family,
but not finishing...

737
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:49,292
it just always left a hole
in my confidence.

738
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,904
Well, you know,
college isn't for everybody,

739
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:53,993
and there are many ways
to get an education.

740
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,342
This job of his,
is it a good one?

741
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:57,518
Oh, crazy good.

742
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:59,085
Well, there you go, then.

743
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:01,740
I mean, college will
always be there.

744
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:04,133
Maybe this is the education
he needs right now.

745
00:29:04,177 --> 00:29:06,135
Wow.

746
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,529
Look at you.

747
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,270
Teaching me
outside of class too.

748
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,580
I'll shadow you to school

749
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:18,452
and then head home,
get some shut-eye.

750
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:19,975
Yeah, my publisher's
bringing in...

751
00:29:20,019 --> 00:29:21,803
...a private security company
for the next few weeks.

752
00:29:21,847 --> 00:29:22,761
Good.

753
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,458
Oh! Henry's coming to dinner.

754
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:26,721
Oh.

755
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:30,769
That's a powerful piece.

756
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:33,119
Oh, yeah.
My grandmother made that.

757
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:34,250
She was a sculptor.

758
00:29:34,294 --> 00:29:35,817
Is it supposed to be
melted like that?

759
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:38,646
No. It was damaged during
the MOVE bombing.

760
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,039
Wait, I remember that.

761
00:29:40,082 --> 00:29:42,215
Oh.

762
00:29:42,258 --> 00:29:43,694
Most people don't.

763
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:45,218
Yeah. I'm -- I-I grew up
outside Philly.

764
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,394
That was, what, 1984?

765
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:49,875
It was May 13, 1985.

766
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:51,224
Yeah.

767
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:53,008
The cops were trying to get

768
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:54,401
a group of Black activists

769
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:55,750
out of their house,

770
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,143
and when they couldn't
get them out,

771
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:58,971
they fired 10,000 rounds
of ammunition

772
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:00,842
into a house
with children in it.

773
00:30:00,886 --> 00:30:02,844
Then they dropped a bomb
on the roof --

774
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:05,934
killed 11 people,
including 5 kids.

775
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:07,806
I remember there was
a-a huge fire.

776
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,198
Did your grandmother's
house burn?

777
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,897
Mm. Yeah. Along with 60 others.

778
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,202
Two whole blocks.

779
00:30:13,246 --> 00:30:15,030
And the cops just watched.

780
00:30:15,074 --> 00:30:17,990
That sculpture was the only
thing we could salvage.

781
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,034
I'm so sorry.

782
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:21,167
I was 10 years old.

783
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:22,559
Playing in her front room

784
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,735
when people started coming,
banging on the door,

785
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,173
telling us we had to get out.

786
00:30:27,216 --> 00:30:29,436
There were embers falling
from the sky,

787
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:31,394
burning our skin.

788
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:35,355
Nana grabbed my hand
and we ran, but...

789
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:36,965
we couldn't get away.

790
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:39,750
No wonder you became
an activist yourself.

791
00:30:39,794 --> 00:30:42,362
Exactly.

792
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:45,713
Now you understand why I'm not
backing down from these

793
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:47,628
Southern Front jackasses.

794
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:52,851
- <i>Armed. Away. Exit now.
- Alright. Ready to go.</i>

795
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:55,462
Okay. Give me one second.

796
00:30:58,639 --> 00:30:59,988
Okay.

797
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,992
How'd you sleep?

798
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:06,081
Good.

799
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,387
Not good.

800
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,475
Don't tell me --

801
00:31:08,518 --> 00:31:09,911
you've got some sure-fire

802
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:11,391
REM-sleep technique I can try.

803
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:12,958
Actually, I do.

804
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:14,742
Man, I heard you were
such a hard-ass,

805
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:16,396
and here you are,
showing me ladybugs

806
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:18,398
and teaching me
how to be all zen.

807
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:20,269
What can I say?
I'm a complicated guy.

808
00:31:20,313 --> 00:31:21,444
Uh-huh.

809
00:31:23,229 --> 00:31:26,493
Okay.

810
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,064
<i>♪ Watch what I can do</i>

811
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:36,590
<i>♪ ...I can do</i>

812
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:39,201
<i>♪ I got that feeling</i>

813
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:40,724
<i>♪ ...what I can do Oh, no.</i>

814
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:48,036
Hello?

815
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,385
<i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

816
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:51,039
<i>The white supremacists
we were talking about --</i>

817
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,649
the Southern Front --
they just pulled in behind you.

818
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:55,000
What do I do? <i> Stay calm.</i>

819
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,305
I'm right behind them.

820
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:57,393
We don't want them to know
you've seen them yet.

821
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:58,438
Oh, my God, John --

822
00:31:58,481 --> 00:31:59,787
<i>Don't worry, okay?</i>

823
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,093
Just keep driving,
keep your speed even.

824
00:32:01,136 --> 00:32:02,355
<i>I'm gonna call in
for a little help.</i>

825
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:03,573
Why are they following me?

826
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:04,923
Why don't they just kill me?

827
00:32:04,966 --> 00:32:06,098
<i>The Southern Front
likes to make statements.</i>

828
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,577
<i>They kidnap high-profile targets</i>

829
00:32:07,621 --> 00:32:09,579
<i>and then put them on trial
to answer for their crimes.</i>

830
00:32:09,623 --> 00:32:10,972
And everyone's found guilty.

831
00:32:11,016 --> 00:32:12,234
<i>Give me a sec.

832
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:13,975
Control, this is
off-duty Officer John Nolan,

833
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,324
badge number 2-5-2-5-3.

834
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:17,936
I have a possible 2-0-7
in progress.

835
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:20,373
Victim is headed west on 11th

836
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:21,852
in a silver late-model Sentra,

837
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:23,115
being pursued
by two pickup trucks --

838
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,768
one brown, one blue,
both lifted.

839
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:26,335
<i>Three occupants, presumed armed.</i>

840
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:28,381
I'm following in my P.O.V.,
a black Tundra.

841
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:29,991
7-Adam-19 responding.

842
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:38,434
What do I do?
Do I run the light? <i>No.</i>

843
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:39,958
Uh, stop, but be ready to bolt.

844
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:41,133
I'm gonna try something.

845
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:53,667
What the hell's wrong with you?

846
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:56,322
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

847
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:58,019
'Cause --
Oh, that's some damage.

848
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:59,803
Oh, I don't think
this is gonna buff out.

849
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,501
Did you have that damage before?

850
00:33:01,544 --> 00:33:03,503
Police. Get down. Get down.
Get on the ground.

851
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:04,895
Here.

852
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:05,635
Cuff yourself to that,
right there.

853
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,463
Cuff yourself -- fast.

854
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:11,032
You're making a big mistake.

855
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:12,773
Well, they tell me that
all the time.

856
00:33:42,629 --> 00:33:44,196
Out of the car! Now!

857
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:04,216
7-Adam-07, shots fired.

858
00:34:04,259 --> 00:34:06,348
Multiple armed suspects
with assault rifles.

859
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:07,828
Need backup and airship.

860
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:23,496
What are you doing?

861
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:25,150
Firefight is one block north.

862
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:26,194
If we take the alley,

863
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:27,152
we'll come up on them
from the side

864
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:28,283
so we can box in the enemy.

865
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:30,111
The suspects, not enemy.

866
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:32,418
Right, suspects.

867
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:56,833
Grab her! We gotta go!

868
00:35:14,982 --> 00:35:16,549
She's running!

869
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:33,174
Fiona's on the move!

870
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:34,697
Headed south down the alley,

871
00:35:34,741 --> 00:35:35,785
one armed suspect in pursuit.

872
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:36,917
We gotta even the odds here.

873
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,005
I'm runnin' on empty.

874
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:40,138
One odds-evener coming up.
Be ready.

875
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:09,645
Down on the ground! Don't move!

876
00:36:09,689 --> 00:36:11,212
- You got him?
- Yeah. Got him.

877
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:12,344
Roll over!

878
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:22,832
Oh!

879
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,714
Don't move! You're under arrest!

880
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,592
You okay?

881
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,638
No! I'm not okay.

882
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:49,076
They tried to kill me.

883
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:03,612
Day two and <i>you're</i> filling out
the paperwork?

884
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:05,440
You got something to say, Chen?

885
00:37:05,484 --> 00:37:08,922
Uh, yeah, I do. I...

886
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:11,011
Why are you being
so nice to her?

887
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:12,969
My first few days on the job,

888
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:15,233
you kicked me out of the car,
tormented me.

889
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,278
A month later, you -- you -- you
stole my duty belt

890
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:18,323
while I had to go pee.

891
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:19,933
You called me "Boot"
so many times,

892
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:21,630
I get triggered
when I go shoe shopping.

893
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:23,328
Look, Officer Barnes
has other issues.

894
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:24,633
Like what?

895
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:27,549
Like, she's fit and beautiful
and smart --

896
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:29,072
She won't wear perfume.

897
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,335
W-What does that have to do
with anything?

898
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,423
What?

899
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:35,557
Look, I teach my recruits

900
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:36,732
according to what they need.

901
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,560
Officer Barnes
won't wear perfume

902
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:39,735
because she's still worried

903
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:41,128
it'll give away her position.

904
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:43,739
A part of her is still
waging a war in Afghanistan,

905
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:45,915
and if she's gonna be a cop,
that has to go.

906
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:49,789
You are a kind
and insightful person.

907
00:37:49,832 --> 00:37:51,573
You see the good in people.

908
00:37:51,617 --> 00:37:53,096
So much so
that I had to show you

909
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,794
the world can be a scary place.

910
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:57,187
Officer Barnes only sees
a scary place,

911
00:37:57,231 --> 00:37:58,232
and she needs to know that

912
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,320
not everyone's out to hurt her.

913
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:07,807
Is she gonna be okay?

914
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,330
I think so.

915
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:11,158
And who knows --

916
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:13,769
one day...

917
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:15,597
she might even be
as good as you.

918
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:28,741
There.

919
00:38:28,784 --> 00:38:31,352
Grey said your security team
is top-notch,

920
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:33,006
so they will make sure
you're safe.

921
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:35,051
Was Computer Crimes able
to figure out

922
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:36,401
if Andy was the one
who doxxed me?

923
00:38:36,444 --> 00:38:37,967
Unfortunately, no.

924
00:38:38,011 --> 00:38:41,188
If it was him, he covered
his tracks very well.

925
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:43,843
Can the student offer
the teacher some advice?

926
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,410
Sure.

927
00:38:45,453 --> 00:38:46,976
You're not gonna sleep well.

928
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,804
For a while.

929
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:52,765
You're gonna be jumpy
and irritable and on edge.

930
00:38:52,808 --> 00:38:54,854
Is this experience talking?

931
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,682
It's the downside
of having a job

932
00:38:56,725 --> 00:38:58,553
filled with trauma and tragedy.

933
00:38:58,597 --> 00:38:59,859
Yeah, I'm all too familiar

934
00:38:59,902 --> 00:39:01,904
with the toll it can take
on the mind and body.

935
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:04,690
Just take your feelings
seriously,

936
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:05,908
and get help if you need it.

937
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:07,910
It'll only get worse
if you don't.

938
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:09,738

939
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:11,305
You're welcome.

Just finished.

947

I, uh... need to talk to you
about something.

948
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:35,547
Transitioning from
military to police

949
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,418
has been harder than I expected.

950
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:38,767
And you're handling it.

951
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:41,335
In two shifts, you turned
your past into an asset.

952
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:43,511
I mean, you switched
from warrior to caregiver.

953
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:45,339
Yeah, but it's what's
still down the road
that has me worried.

954
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,949
What do you mean?

955
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:48,690
Looking out over the city
yesterday,

956
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:50,692
feeling the sun on my face --

957
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:51,998
that's the first time

958
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,608
I've felt at peace
in a long time.

959
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:56,219
And that feeling will grow.

960
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:58,744
You just need to give yourself
a little more time to adjust.

961
00:39:58,787 --> 00:40:00,354
No, I don't know that I can --

962
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,660
at least not while
wearing a uniform.

963
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:05,228
I need to see what life is like

964
00:40:05,272 --> 00:40:07,883
when I'm not in survival mode
all the time.

965
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:11,060
And that's not gonna happen
if I'm a cop.

966
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:12,540
So, with my report,

967
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:16,283
I am also submitting
my resignation memo.

968
00:40:16,326 --> 00:40:18,981
No. I don't accept that.

969
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:21,854
You're gonna be a great cop,
and I know it.

970
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:23,943
And I can help you transition.

971
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:27,903
From warrior to peacekeeper...

972
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:28,948
to peace.

973
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:31,559
I really appreciate it, sir.

974
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:34,736
But this might be
the last chance I have
to change my course,

975
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,652
leave the violence behind.

976
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:40,655
