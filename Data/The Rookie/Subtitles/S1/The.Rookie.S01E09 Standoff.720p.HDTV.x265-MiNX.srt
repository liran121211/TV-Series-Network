1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,073
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

2
00:00:01,098 --> 00:00:02,673
Where are your keys? I need a car!

3
00:00:02,733 --> 00:00:03,934
Drop the gun!

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:09,366
Is he going
through anything in his personal life?

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,595
Breakup? Interpersonal conflict?

6
00:00:11,697 --> 00:00:12,950
No.

7
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,737
What if I can't get past this, Luce?

8
00:00:14,837 --> 00:00:16,400
How will I ever do the job again?

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,613
Your wife made a deal
to be a confidential informant.

10
00:00:18,637 --> 00:00:20,437
- What?
- You want me to wear a wire?

11
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,543
He's on to her. He knows she was a cop.

12
00:00:22,616 --> 00:00:24,376
- Damn it. Go. Go, go.
- Police!

13
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:25,577
They must have gone out the back.

14
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:26,763
You did this!

15
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:29,592
You know who I am?

16
00:00:29,656 --> 00:00:32,361
You're Kyle Montgomery.
You're Alex's brother.

17
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:50,455
Hey!

18
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,846
Okay.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,701
John, are you okay?

20
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:12,392
I knew it was a mistake.

21
00:01:12,459 --> 00:01:14,228
Nothing you could've done to stop it.

22
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:16,241
I could've blown the operation
early before she went in.

23
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,965
And then you would've gotten
yourself fired.

24
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,718
Torturing yourself
isn't gonna help us find her.

25
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:21,420
She's dead, Angela.

26
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:23,608
Vance killed her the second they
got free of our surveillance.

27
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,625
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

28
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,487
Just like I always knew
I'd end up looking for her body.

29
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:30,974
<i>We found her.</i>

30
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,417
<i>Alley on Crenshaw near the 10.
Get here now.</i>

31
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:52,617
She's alive, but it's not good.

32
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:54,225
They shot her in the head.

33
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,805
I'm he... I'm here, baby.
I'm here. I'm here.

34
00:02:08,815 --> 00:02:11,617
This is Officer John Nolan.
I was just attacked in my home.

35
00:02:11,652 --> 00:02:13,172
The suspect is in custody.

36
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,964
He's, uh, unconscious but breathing.

37
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:16,329
Requires an ambulance.

38
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:18,872
5439 Chautauqua.

39
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,405
Thank you.

40
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:21,861
This is bad.

41
00:02:21,895 --> 00:02:22,958
But <i>he</i> attacked <i>me.</i>

42
00:02:22,983 --> 00:02:24,033
Yeah, and in five minutes,

43
00:02:24,064 --> 00:02:25,571
this place
is gonna be flooded with cops

44
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:27,867
who will instantly know
that you and I slept together.

45
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:30,736
Well, who's to say this
wasn't just a friendly hangout?

46
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:32,978
At 1:00 in the morning?

47
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:36,437
I didn't tell investigators about us

48
00:02:36,462 --> 00:02:38,130
when they interviewed me
after your shooting,

49
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:41,057
and they asked me point-blank
about your relationships.

50
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:42,736
That's a lie they could fire me for.

51
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:45,236
Okay, then just go.
Go before they get here.

52
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:46,829
He knows someone was here.

53
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:48,355
Look, look.

54
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:51,376
He has just suffered
a fairly serious head injury.

55
00:02:51,411 --> 00:02:52,879
Odds are he's not
gonna remember anything,

56
00:02:53,119 --> 00:02:55,981
and even if he does,
he didn't see you, okay?

57
00:02:56,027 --> 00:02:57,994
It's a harmless lie, Lucy.

58
00:02:58,181 --> 00:03:00,032
It doesn't change anything
about what happened here.

59
00:03:01,422 --> 00:03:02,855
Just go.

60
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:19,195
You sure you don't need
to go to the hospital?

61
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,893
No, I'm fine.

62
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:23,527
Good thing
you got that gun away from him.

63
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:25,639
- Yes, ma'am.
- Officer Nolan.

64
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:28,603
I did not expect
to see you again so soon.

65
00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:29,762
Me neither, sir.

66
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,840
Well, can you brief me while
it's still fresh in your head?

67
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:32,898
Yeah, of course.

68
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:34,600
Uh, I couldn't sleep,

69
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:35,935
went to the kitchen for a bite to eat.

70
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:38,033
I noticed the sliding door was open.

71
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,127
I went to investigate.

72
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,799
That's when he hit me with the bat.

73
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:42,591
Why didn't he just shoot you?

74
00:03:42,616 --> 00:03:44,920
I think he had something
he needed to get off his chest.

75
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:46,579
He was clearly feeling guilty

76
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:47,828
about what happened with his brother.

77
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:48,912
He said that?

78
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,606
No, not exactly,
but that's what he meant.

79
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:52,982
How did you overpower him?

80
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:55,374
I knocked him off balance
when he fired the gun.

81
00:03:55,748 --> 00:03:57,715
The bullet hit the floor over there.

82
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,406
And we fought, and
I threw him through the glass.

83
00:04:03,057 --> 00:04:05,131
And who lives in the big house?

84
00:04:05,165 --> 00:04:06,303
My friend Ben.

85
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:09,001
Uh, we were college roommates.
He's away traveling.

86
00:04:09,345 --> 00:04:12,772
So you, uh... You were home alone?

87
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:15,833
Yes, sir.

88
00:04:15,858 --> 00:04:17,469
I was alone.

89
00:04:26,277 --> 00:04:27,951
So what are you doing here?

90
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:29,428
Why aren't you at the hospital?

91
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:31,267
Because I can't do brain surgery.

92
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:34,364
But I can catch the guy who
put that bullet in her head.

93
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,071
Are you okay?

94
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:44,460
I'm fine.

95
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,138
Compared to her.

96
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,175
If she survives surgery,

97
00:04:49,466 --> 00:04:51,510
doctor says she might have a chance.

98
00:04:51,921 --> 00:04:53,679
She strikes me as a fighter.

99
00:04:55,146 --> 00:04:56,455
Yeah.

100
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,201
She's definitely that.

101
00:05:00,012 --> 00:05:01,565
Tim...

102
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:05,903
Wolfe and Vestri were
doing their jobs with Isabel.

103
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:08,003
Making what happened personal

104
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:10,414
is not gonna get you what you want.

105
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,171
You understand?

106
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:18,279
Yeah.

107
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:23,909
You know what Vance did
to your girlfriend?

108
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,457
Who?

109
00:05:25,482 --> 00:05:28,684
You sent Isabel Bradford out to
make a buy for you last night,

110
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:30,844
and Marcus Vance shot her in the head.

111
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:34,466
Ouch.

112
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,068
- Listen!
- Hey, hey!

113
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:38,677
Carson, today is
not the day to screw around.

114
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:40,926
<i>Where can we find Vance?</i>

115
00:05:42,062 --> 00:05:43,519
No way.

116
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:45,789
I tell you that, they'll put
a bullet in my head, too.

117
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:47,789
<i>Son, you don't have a play here.</i>

118
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:49,917
If you don't give him up,
every cop in this building

119
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:51,859
will make sure word gets back to Vance

120
00:05:51,938 --> 00:05:53,739
that you ratted him out.

121
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:00,853
Officer Nolan, come in.

122
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,483
- Is everything okay?
- Have a seat.

123
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,840
You've officially been cleared
in the Alex Montgomery shooting.

124
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,601
It was deemed a justifiable homicide.

125
00:06:10,891 --> 00:06:12,358
That's a relief. Thank you.

126
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,760
I thought you were calling me
in here for bad news.

127
00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:16,295
Well, there's more.

128
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:18,559
A new investigation has been opened

129
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:20,954
into your altercation last night.

130
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:23,202
Kyle attacked me.

131
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:25,402
- What is there to investigate?
- It's pro forma.

132
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,495
Shouldn't take, uh, but a day or two.

133
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,921
As long as you've been truthful,
there shouldn't be an issue.

134
00:06:30,016 --> 00:06:31,400
You'll be restricted to the station

135
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:32,713
while we get this straightened out.

136
00:06:32,773 --> 00:06:35,476
But I'm sure
you could enjoy a day of quiet

137
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:36,835
after everything you've been through.

138
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,884
Just go ahead and check in
with Officer Yamada

139
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,285
at the front desk.

140
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:42,107
Thank you.

141
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:48,994
What happened?

142
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,221
They put me on desk duty
until they investigate.

143
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:53,374
- What if they find out the truth?
- They won't.

144
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,035
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

145
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:57,656
Uh, are we okay?

146
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:59,138
Yeah, why?

147
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:01,825
Oh. Right.

148
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:04,959
Look, hooking up was
a heat-of-the-moment thing.

149
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:06,885
We just need to make sure
that we don't do it again.

150
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,513
Yeah.

151
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:10,160
What's going on in roll call?

152
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:12,911
Oh. Wolfe and Vestri got
a couple possible locations

153
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:14,485
on the dealer that shot Tim's wife,

154
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,440
so we're getting ready
to hunt the guy down.

155
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:20,081
Be careful.

156
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:21,615
Yeah. You too.

157
00:07:22,862 --> 00:07:24,053
So, according to Carson,

158
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:27,747
Vance is most likely located
at a warehouse facility

159
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:29,929
in South Gate at this address.

160
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:31,818
All right, Detectives Wolfe and Vestri

161
00:07:31,843 --> 00:07:35,413
will stake it out with
patrol units from that division,

162
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:39,565
while you guys will head over
to Bronson Estates,

163
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:44,359
where Carson says Vance's
girlfriend, Cesiah Olivo, lives.

164
00:07:44,558 --> 00:07:46,904
But Carson doesn't
know which apartment she lives in,

165
00:07:46,928 --> 00:07:49,442
so we'll have to do
some knocking on doors.

166
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:51,252
All right, listen up.

167
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:54,446
This has the potential of being
a very dangerous operation.

168
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:56,472
Vance is a heavy hitter.

169
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,292
He has a well-armed crew.

170
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:00,051
So he won't go down easy.

171
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:01,950
All right, watch each other's
backs out there,

172
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:03,341
and be careful.

173
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:09,261
Hey, I'm so sorry about Isabel.

174
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:12,437
Yeah. Thanks.

175
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:13,777
Go kit up our shop.

176
00:08:13,853 --> 00:08:15,627
Ask Mike for the Bradford Special.

177
00:08:15,768 --> 00:08:17,106
What is that?

178
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:19,633
You'll see.

179
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:24,023
Fill out one of these.

180
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:26,769
Officer Yamada? Uh, John Nolan.

181
00:08:26,845 --> 00:08:28,622
I've been assigned to
your watch for the time being.

182
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:30,301
Didn't think they made rookies my age.

183
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:32,645
Yeah, well, with age
comes wisdom, right?

184
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:34,660
My wisdom's about to retire.

185
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,273
In two weeks, I'll be drinking mojitos

186
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,791
on my houseboat in Havasu.

187
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:39,174
Sounds very nice.

188
00:08:39,238 --> 00:08:40,834
So, what do we do here...

189
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:42,960
just help people
who walk in off the street?

190
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:44,386
Well, this may look like reception,

191
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:46,084
but we're really the front lines.

192
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:47,618
We get all sorts of people
coming in here,

193
00:08:47,643 --> 00:08:48,859
with all kinds of complaints.

194
00:08:48,884 --> 00:08:50,215
So, what do we do?

195
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,693
You fill out one of these.

196
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,220
Stamp it right here, in
the uppermost right-hand corner.

197
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:57,222
Give the complaint filer a copy.

198
00:08:57,282 --> 00:08:58,782
- And then what?
- That's all.

199
00:08:58,851 --> 00:08:59,951
Give it a try.

200
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,274
- Oh.
- Unh-unh.

201
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:10,964
Not bad.

202
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:12,935
But it's important the stamp

203
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,795
stay within the confines
of the designated area.

204
00:09:14,895 --> 00:09:16,468
You got some line crossage.

205
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,207
Do it again.

206
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:22,587
Dad, hey.

207
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:25,060
Heard you were tasked
to the shooting of that C.I.

208
00:09:25,085 --> 00:09:26,251
Yes, sir.

209
00:09:26,286 --> 00:09:27,520
You here to tell me to be careful?

210
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:29,045
Well, that goes without saying.

211
00:09:29,141 --> 00:09:31,232
No, I want to ask you
about your friend Nolan.

212
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:33,809
Why? I heard he was cleared
on the shooting.

213
00:09:33,883 --> 00:09:36,238
He was. It's just, uh,

214
00:09:36,428 --> 00:09:39,168
most officers never face
a fatal shooting

215
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:40,827
or a violent home invasion.

216
00:09:40,852 --> 00:09:43,120
Nolan's had both in a 48-hour span.

217
00:09:43,169 --> 00:09:44,919
Look, if you're concerned
about his head space,

218
00:09:44,944 --> 00:09:46,077
don't be.

219
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:47,406
Okay, he was the guy at the Academy

220
00:09:47,431 --> 00:09:49,321
talking everyone else off the ledge.

221
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,293
He's just hit some bad luck.

222
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,650
Hmm.

223
00:09:53,033 --> 00:09:54,410
You don't think so?

224
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,978
Yeah, let's...

225
00:09:56,008 --> 00:09:58,387
let's just say something
feels a little off.

226
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:00,780
Be careful out there.

227
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:03,761
Are you deaf?

228
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:06,385
I said Shakespeare stole my dog.

229
00:10:06,558 --> 00:10:08,073
<i>The</i> Shakespeare?

230
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:10,338
- Is there more than one?
- I don't know.

231
00:10:10,363 --> 00:10:12,130
You said your name was "Flawless."

232
00:10:12,155 --> 00:10:14,023
I'm just trying to roll with it.

233
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,134
Can I help you?

234
00:10:20,414 --> 00:10:22,639
Can you arrest someone
for being incompetent,

235
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,098
uncaring, self-centered, unfaithful,

236
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,507
and pathologically late?

237
00:10:26,574 --> 00:10:27,908
I wish. What's this about?

238
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:30,658
My husband... Ex-husband.

239
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:33,051
Soon-to-be ex-husband.

240
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:36,573
We have our custody exchange
scheduled for now,

241
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,383
and he's late, as usual.

242
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:40,705
Scheduled for here at the station?

243
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,733
Yes. Here.

244
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,416
Court ordered. W-What are you, new?

245
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:46,275
Actually, yeah, I am.

246
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,938
You seem kind of old to be new.

247
00:10:47,963 --> 00:10:49,263
Uh, thank you?

248
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:51,966
Look, Wendell's father
and I hate each other

249
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:53,891
with the passion
of a thousand burning suns.

250
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:55,976
So the judge thought the police station

251
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:58,002
would be the best place
for us to make our switch.

252
00:10:58,027 --> 00:10:59,961
- Makes sense.
- Only I am going to get fired

253
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:01,319
if I'm late for work again.

254
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:02,696
So can I leave him with you?

255
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:04,108
Oh.

256
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,938
Um... yeah, of course.

257
00:11:06,992 --> 00:11:08,595
- Just make sure he has your number.
- Thank you.

258
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,823
Wendell, I've got to go.

259
00:11:09,848 --> 00:11:11,103
Your dad will be here any minute.

260
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:12,398
- Officer...
- Nolan.

261
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,476
...will look after you
until then, okay?

262
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:16,050
I love you.

263
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,236
Thanks.

264
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,579
So, how's it going?

265
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:24,724
Thought I was going to soccer practice.

266
00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:27,805
Instead, I'm stuck in the lobby
of a smelly police station.

267
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,408
I feel your pain.

268
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:45,736
Let's gear up.

269
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:48,193
Got your backup piece?

270
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:50,072
Uh, yeah, of course.

271
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,194
What's this?

272
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,435
Trauma plate for your vest.

273
00:11:56,469 --> 00:11:57,648
Little extra protection.

274
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:59,930
Oh. Bradford Special.

275
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,480
You really think we're gonna need this?

276
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:03,475
You know why they call
this place the Bronson Estates?

277
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,850
'Cause a guy named Bronson built it?

278
00:12:05,886 --> 00:12:07,574
No. Back when you were in short pants,

279
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,878
there was a movie called "Death Wish."

280
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:11,155
- Starred Charles Bronson.
- Yeah. For a long time,

281
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,348
responding to a call here
meant that you had a death wish.

282
00:12:13,505 --> 00:12:15,367
But it's better now, right?

283
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:16,889
It's no longer the wild, wild west.

284
00:12:16,914 --> 00:12:18,265
Lots of low-income families live here.

285
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,374
But it never hurts to be cautious.

286
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:24,662
Hey.

287
00:12:24,764 --> 00:12:26,685
What happened at Nolan's last night?

288
00:12:27,112 --> 00:12:28,476
How should I know?

289
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,302
Thought you might have talked to him.

290
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:31,989
Is there more to the story
I haven't heard?

291
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:34,326
Uh, no. I mean, I don't know.

292
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:35,906
Why?

293
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:38,713
No reason.

294
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:42,861
Let's go.

295
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:45,022
A little extra shock and awe?

296
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:46,069
Damn straight.

297
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:47,187
We're here to talk to people,

298
00:12:47,212 --> 00:12:48,412
not scare the hell out of them.

299
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:50,074
Speak for yourself.

300
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:56,852
All right.

301
00:12:56,899 --> 00:12:58,196
Let's do this.

302
00:12:58,231 --> 00:12:59,665
This'll go faster if we split up.

303
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:00,864
You all right riding solo?

304
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:02,037
Have you met me?

305
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:03,984
Okay. Chen and I will start
on three. You take two.

306
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:05,406
Jackson and Lopez will ground floor it.

307
00:13:05,431 --> 00:13:07,166
Stay in constant radio contact.

308
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,842
What a gentleman.

309
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:15,401
All I could find were these.

310
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:17,882
I thought maybe you could color them.

311
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:20,994
Cool. You got crayons?

312
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,882
Um, maybe. Let me check.

313
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:33,164
Looking for something?

314
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:34,964
Uh, yeah. Crayons.

315
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:36,341
Long story.

316
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:38,492
- You got a minute?
- Yeah. What's up?

317
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,128
Maybe we should go somewhere
a little more private.

318
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,601
- Seems serious.
- Oh, not at all.

319
00:13:56,635 --> 00:14:00,778
It's just, something's come up
that I need to get clarity on.

320
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,938
Kyle Montgomery,
the man who attacked you,

321
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:06,047
he claims that you lured him
to your house

322
00:14:06,072 --> 00:14:07,439
in order to kill him.

323
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:09,835
That's ridiculous. Why would I do that?

324
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:11,531
That's what I thought.

325
00:14:11,637 --> 00:14:13,124
But I have to ask...

326
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:15,887
You didn't do that, right?

327
00:14:16,054 --> 00:14:17,320
No.

328
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,077
Great.

329
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:20,517
Good.

330
00:14:22,982 --> 00:14:25,655
Oh. You know, he also said
one other thing.

331
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:29,447
He insists there was
someone else at your house.

332
00:14:29,508 --> 00:14:32,577
Says he heard a voice
before you knocked him out.

333
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:34,545
You said you were alone, right?

334
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:36,128
Yeah.

335
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:39,765
Are you lying to me, Officer Nolan?

336
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:42,053
No, sir.

337
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:53,896
Get away!

338
00:14:55,732 --> 00:14:57,399
Get out of here.

339
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,878
Something bothering you, Officer Nolan?

340
00:15:10,687 --> 00:15:13,411
- Uh, no, I'm fine.
- Liar.

341
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:19,642
I just had, uh,
an intense couple of days,

342
00:15:19,856 --> 00:15:22,324
and I'm not quite sure
how to talk about it yet.

343
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:26,058
Long as you're clear with yourself,

344
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:29,113
there's no reason
you have to share anything.

345
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,513
I'm taking the kid for a snack.

346
00:15:32,074 --> 00:15:33,384
Mind the fort.

347
00:15:33,696 --> 00:15:35,330
Yes, sir.

348
00:15:46,591 --> 00:15:47,916
Yo.

349
00:15:48,992 --> 00:15:50,273
How can I help you?

350
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:52,554
I'm, uh, Jeff Turner.

351
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:55,357
I'm here to pick up
my... my son. Wendell.

352
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:56,849
Right. Officer Yamada just took him

353
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:58,234
to the break room for a Doritos run.

354
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:00,226
They shouldn't be a few minutes.
Do you have any photo I.D.?

355
00:16:00,637 --> 00:16:02,137
Oh, yeah.

356
00:16:12,314 --> 00:16:13,761
Mr. Turner, have you been drinking?

357
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:14,943
No, no.

358
00:16:14,978 --> 00:16:16,168
I mean, you know, not really.

359
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,747
Just a little... a little eye-opener.

360
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,550
That's not a thing.

361
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,305
How'd you get here? Did you drive?

362
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:24,045
No.

363
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:26,655
No, um... Uber.

364
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,625
Why don't you come with me?

365
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:32,003
Right over here.

366
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:36,186
I'm gonna let you sober up
in here for a little while.

367
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:37,850
I can't let you take your son
home in this condition.

368
00:16:37,874 --> 00:16:39,790
And I don't think you want
to let him see you like this.

369
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,680
- I'm fine.
- Or I can arrest you

370
00:16:41,705 --> 00:16:42,865
for being drunk and disorderly,

371
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,493
and you can see how much fun
L.A. County Prison is.

372
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:56,692
- Who's there?
- Gas company.

373
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,935
Cesiah Olivo. Just the woman
we're looking for.

374
00:17:00,995 --> 00:17:02,720
- Marcus isn't here.
- Yeah, we're gonna need to be sure.

375
00:17:02,744 --> 00:17:04,345
- Hey, you can't...
- Sit!

376
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,567
Clear.

377
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:08,642
Clear.

378
00:17:08,685 --> 00:17:10,160
When's the last time
you heard from Vance?

379
00:17:10,226 --> 00:17:11,633
Yesterday.

380
00:17:11,688 --> 00:17:14,168
He was supposed to come over
last night. He never showed up.

381
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,072
You know who he is?
What he does for a living?

382
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:19,147
Yeah.

383
00:17:19,225 --> 00:17:21,710
- And you're okay with that?
- No.

384
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:23,846
But I was pregnant
by the time I found out.

385
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,125
And he made me move in here

386
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,849
so his guys can keep an eye on me.

387
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,871
- Make sure I don't go anywhere.
- So you're a prisoner.

388
00:17:28,896 --> 00:17:30,336
No.

389
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:33,162
But he had a son
who died in a car accident.

390
00:17:33,242 --> 00:17:35,157
He needs to make sure
nothing happens to our baby.

391
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:37,256
You want out, we can get you out.

392
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:39,528
Only if I give him up.

393
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:40,794
Forget it.

394
00:17:40,866 --> 00:17:42,303
- If we...
- Cesiah, do you really want

395
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,963
a guy like that
taking care of your child?

396
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:47,248
There's no guarantee
that he'll keep you around

397
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:48,968
after this baby is born.

398
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,873
All you have to do is call him.

399
00:17:51,043 --> 00:17:52,508
Say you're not feeling well.

400
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:53,965
You're worried about the baby.

401
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:55,356
I can't.

402
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:58,380
It's one call.

403
00:17:58,503 --> 00:17:59,982
We get him out of your life for good,

404
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:01,750
make sure you and the baby are safe.

405
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:04,386
You promise?

406
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:07,305
He hurt someone I care about.

407
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:09,098
He's going away forever.

408
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:30,546
Hello?

409
00:18:31,008 --> 00:18:32,153
It's me.

410
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:33,866
Why are you calling?

411
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:35,391
You need to come over. I...

412
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:36,667
I don't feel right.

413
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:38,229
I-I'm worried that
there's something wrong.

414
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:39,789
I'm sure everything's okay.

415
00:18:39,835 --> 00:18:41,723
You're probably just overreacting.

416
00:18:41,748 --> 00:18:42,941
I'm not.

417
00:18:42,966 --> 00:18:44,600
What if there's something wrong
with the baby?

418
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,229
Okay, okay. Stay put.

419
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:48,730
I'll come over as soon as I can.

420
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:50,242
Are you friends
with people in the building?

421
00:18:50,266 --> 00:18:52,234
No. I keep to myself most of the time.

422
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:53,809
So you haven't seen this girl?

423
00:18:54,122 --> 00:18:56,303
Sorry. Never seen her before.

424
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,218
Who is she? Did she do something bad?

425
00:18:59,612 --> 00:19:01,366
She's a person of interest.

426
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:03,212
You sure you haven't seen her?

427
00:19:03,428 --> 00:19:06,090
100%. I'd remember her.

428
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:09,686
What about this guy? You seen him?

429
00:19:11,305 --> 00:19:12,543
Nope.

430
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:16,805
Anybody else here?

431
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:18,140
No.

432
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:20,903
Okay. Thanks for your time.

433
00:19:40,715 --> 00:19:43,574
7-Adam-19.
Shots fired at Bronson Estates.

434
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:45,701
Tim, um, we're hearing gunshots.

435
00:19:45,745 --> 00:19:46,945
What's your status?

436
00:19:49,495 --> 00:19:51,084
Talia, are you there?

437
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:53,686
Control, respond.

438
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:56,056
Marcus has a frequency jammer
in the basement.

439
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:57,857
One of his guys
brought it back from Iraq.

440
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,593
No signal.

441
00:20:06,926 --> 00:20:08,254
Aah!

442
00:20:16,227 --> 00:20:18,011
Aah! Aah!

443
00:20:19,925 --> 00:20:21,892
Radio's not working. Try yours.

444
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:23,678
Look out!

445
00:20:38,766 --> 00:20:40,266
We need to get out of this hallway.

446
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:46,139
We don't have time for packing.
We gotta go.

447
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:47,531
- Hush.
- I need things for the baby.

448
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:48,861
I can't leave here without them.

449
00:20:48,886 --> 00:20:51,077
It's okay. We're gonna get you
to a safe place.

450
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:53,366
- When are you due?
- A week ago.

451
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,951
Vance. Your boyfriend's here.

452
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:08,775
To the police officers inside,
I'm here for Cesiah.

453
00:21:09,406 --> 00:21:11,501
She walks out, you walk away.

454
00:21:11,665 --> 00:21:13,749
Otherwise, we're gonna
come in and take her.

455
00:21:13,829 --> 00:21:15,088
No, you're not.

456
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:17,179
'Cause you can't risk her
getting hit in the crossfire.

457
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:19,491
You give up, we'll make sure
she goes to the hospital

458
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,360
- when the baby comes.
- Forget it.

459
00:21:21,542 --> 00:21:23,510
I'm not leaving here without my kid.

460
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:24,906
Then I'd say we're at a stalemate.

461
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:26,865
- What are you doing?
- I bought us a little time,

462
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:28,632
but they're coming through
that door soon enough.

463
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:30,450
And I'm not sure we can stop them.

464
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,348
I think I know what happened.

465
00:21:36,524 --> 00:21:38,758
I had the TV on back at the house.

466
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:39,922
"SportsCenter."

467
00:21:39,947 --> 00:21:42,914
Kyle must've heard that
and got confused.

468
00:21:43,314 --> 00:21:45,665
Yeah. Could be.

469
00:21:45,995 --> 00:21:47,433
Let me ask you this...

470
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:50,537
When I was there,
I noticed the shower was wet,

471
00:21:50,998 --> 00:21:52,627
but you weren't.

472
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:55,475
Caught me.

473
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:56,952
I'm an East Coast guy.

474
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:59,891
I cannot get used to
this desert L.A. air.

475
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:04,484
I sometimes use the shower
as a makeshift humidifier.

476
00:22:04,747 --> 00:22:06,152
You know there's a drought.

477
00:22:06,187 --> 00:22:08,788
Yes, sir. I'll stop doing that.

478
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:12,192
Um, I should get
back to the front desk.

479
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,527
You have a son, don't you?

480
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:15,983
Yes, sir.

481
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:17,697
His name is Henry. He's 18.

482
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:21,134
The biggest sin for my kids was lying.

483
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,782
I told Jackson from an early age...

484
00:22:24,258 --> 00:22:27,927
I can forgive anything but dishonesty.

485
00:22:29,154 --> 00:22:31,344
I told my son something similar.

486
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:33,646
You have till the end of the day

487
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:35,515
to amend your statement.

488
00:22:36,152 --> 00:22:37,383
After that...

489
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:40,146
Understood.

490
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,455
What do you want?

491
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,532
I'm sorry, but I need to come in.

492
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:53,715
Are you here alone?

493
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:55,235
No, my husband's here.

494
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:56,649
What's happening?

495
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,641
There are at least three active
shooters in this building.

496
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:00,633
I've lost comms,
and four of my fellow officers

497
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,006
are in danger.

498
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:05,296
Oh, I-I stopped paying
the bills months ago.

499
00:23:05,422 --> 00:23:06,676
My husband has cancer.

500
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:08,735
And all of the money
goes to his treatment.

501
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,689
Look, he can barely
get out of bed anymore.

502
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:13,283
And you are putting him in
jeopardy by just being here.

503
00:23:13,387 --> 00:23:15,355
I'm sorry, but until
I think of a better option,

504
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:16,508
you're stuck with me.

505
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:18,137
Now, if you could find
some medical supplies,

506
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,045
I'd love to take care of this arm.

507
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,193
Oh, God. Of course.

508
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:24,164
If I have anything,
I have medical supplies.

509
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,523
The phone doesn't have a signal either.

510
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:30,178
Must be a jammer.

511
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,462
Police! Drop the bags!
Show me your hands!

512
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:47,930
Don't shoot!

513
00:23:51,656 --> 00:23:52,748
Lopez.

514
00:23:52,773 --> 00:23:53,906
Which one's your apartment?

515
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:55,839
- Why?
- You don't want to find out.

516
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:57,230
We need to get out of this hallway.

517
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:05,631
Vance said no witnesses!

518
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,024
Tell him we're going upstairs!

519
00:24:10,544 --> 00:24:11,858
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?

520
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,423
You don't have a warrant,
and I didn't invite you in.

521
00:24:13,447 --> 00:24:15,173
So you can't conduct a search.

522
00:24:18,818 --> 00:24:20,118
Clear.

523
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:23,656
We're stuck.

524
00:24:23,815 --> 00:24:25,099
Think the others are all right?

525
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,244
I hope so.

526
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:30,174
You okay?

527
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,664
- A contraction.
- Okay.

528
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:32,865
- Really big one.
- All right.

529
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,159
Maybe you should sit down.

530
00:24:38,505 --> 00:24:40,159
How long until
somebody knows we're missing?

531
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:42,015
It might be a while. We're
on special assignment here.

532
00:24:42,088 --> 00:24:43,816
They don't expect us
to check in regularly.

533
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:48,559
They blocked the peephole.

534
00:24:48,636 --> 00:24:50,250
What, so we're blind?

535
00:24:51,352 --> 00:24:53,371
No, we're not.

536
00:24:53,544 --> 00:24:54,821
- Find me some tape.
- Oh!

537
00:24:54,855 --> 00:24:56,068
Cesiah, do... do you have any tape?

538
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:57,721
Front, front. Just...

539
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,294
Give me your body cam.

540
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,870
Put tape right here.

541
00:25:05,933 --> 00:25:08,667
There's a body-cam app
on your city-issued phone.

542
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:10,162
Open it.

543
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,968
They're getting ready to come in.
Help me barricade the door.

544
00:25:22,383 --> 00:25:23,882
- Lucy.
- Yeah?

545
00:25:24,051 --> 00:25:25,485
My water just broke.

546
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,138
What are we gonna do?

547
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,043
If they break through the door,
we're gonna get overrun.

548
00:25:35,263 --> 00:25:36,513
Gotta get to them first.

549
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:38,515
Okay.

550
00:25:58,452 --> 00:26:00,337
Stop, stop! You're gonna hit Cesiah!

551
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:02,339
- Hold it! Hold it!
- Get 'em out of here.

552
00:26:02,642 --> 00:26:04,541
All right, go, go, go, go. Go.

553
00:26:04,732 --> 00:26:06,176
Boss, we need to go.

554
00:26:06,211 --> 00:26:07,794
At some point, the cops
are gonna send backup

555
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:09,029
when these guys don't report in.

556
00:26:09,054 --> 00:26:10,708
I'm not leaving without my kid.

557
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:12,869
Then you need to find a way fast.

558
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:16,490
Should we move her to a different room?

559
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:18,662
No... Looks like we're clear for now.

560
00:26:18,795 --> 00:26:20,203
I need to go to the hospital.

561
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:22,415
- The baby's coming.
- Yeah, no, I know, I know.

562
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,361
But that's not possible right now.

563
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:28,536
Wait. So, what?
You're gonna deliver my baby?

564
00:26:28,646 --> 00:26:30,013
Uh...

565
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,011
Yes.

566
00:26:34,045 --> 00:26:35,681
Yes, I guess I am.

567
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,041
These cops forced
their way into my apartment.

568
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,123
They refuse to leave.

569
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:42,078
We're trying to stay alive.
You got a problem with that?

570
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:43,398
Yeah, my brother's doing 20 years

571
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:44,476
for something he didn't do.

572
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:45,584
So, yeah, I got a problem with that.

573
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:46,867
Look, I appreciate
where you're coming from,

574
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:48,136
but we're not here to cause trouble.

575
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:50,251
We're here because
somebody's trying to kill us.

576
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:52,879
Vance?

577
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:56,319
- You know him?
- Yeah. Enough to steer clear.

578
00:26:56,344 --> 00:26:57,711
He's got a dozen guys living here.

579
00:26:57,794 --> 00:26:59,628
- You walked into a buzz saw.
- No kidding.

580
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:01,554
We need to call for help,
but he's jamming our signals.

581
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:02,829
Any idea how we fix that?

582
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:03,910
Shut the power off in the building.

583
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:05,034
Jammer should go off.

584
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:06,210
How do we turn off the power?

585
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,870
Main circuit breaker's in the basement.

586
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:10,263
I know this because I see it
every time I'm doing my laundry.

587
00:27:10,308 --> 00:27:12,109
It's not gonna be easy
getting to the basement.

588
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:13,912
I only have two magazines left.

589
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:16,251
Me too. And those are
gonna go real quick

590
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,830
if we get into trouble outside.

591
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:24,650
W-What are you doing? Hey.

592
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:26,809
Why are you knocking my wall?

593
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:29,668
Maybe we don't need to go
outside to get to the basement.

594
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:36,903
Will my dad be here soon?

595
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:38,342
Yeah.

596
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:40,201
I'm sure he'll be along any minute.

597
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:43,205
You think maybe he forgot about me?

598
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:46,512
Oh.

599
00:27:47,618 --> 00:27:49,655
Wendell, your dad's
actually here already.

600
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,009
He was only a few minutes late.

601
00:27:51,034 --> 00:27:53,223
- But when he arrived...
- He was drunk.

602
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,278
Yeah.

603
00:27:55,338 --> 00:27:58,374
I'm having him sleep it off
in one of the cells.

604
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:00,245
He's drunk a lot.

605
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:01,857
That's why they're getting divorced.

606
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,453
But my mom says it doesn't
mean he loves me any less.

607
00:28:04,825 --> 00:28:06,350
Well, she's right.

608
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,398
And I'm sorry I lied to you.

609
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:10,656
I should have been honest.

610
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:13,716
I thought
I was protecting you, but I...

611
00:28:13,804 --> 00:28:15,438
I see you deserve the truth.

612
00:28:15,512 --> 00:28:16,612
It's okay.

613
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,268
My folks lie to me a lot these days.

614
00:28:20,189 --> 00:28:23,153
I know they mean well, but...

615
00:28:24,381 --> 00:28:27,891
it just makes things
a lot worse, you know?

616
00:28:31,208 --> 00:28:33,076
Oh, come on. Come on.

617
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,690
Hey.

618
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:38,247
Hey! Come on! What are you doing?!

619
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:39,488
You're wrecking my kitchen.

620
00:28:39,513 --> 00:28:40,862
Who's gonna pay for this?

621
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:42,235
L.A.P.D.

622
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:43,866
And if they don't, send the bill to me.

623
00:28:54,689 --> 00:28:56,954
Next stop. Basement.

624
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,111
Control, show us out of our car,
Bronson Estate.

625
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,726
Any word from the officers inside?

626
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:04,861
<i>Negative.</i>

627
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,332
If you want something done right,

628
00:29:06,406 --> 00:29:07,764
you gotta do it yourself.

629
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:24,794
Get beside me.

630
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:45,561
Go!

631
00:29:46,497 --> 00:29:47,837
This way!

632
00:29:49,104 --> 00:29:50,906
- Found one!
- Shoot him!

633
00:29:51,007 --> 00:29:52,608
Shoot him, shoot him!

634
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:57,209
Get back! Get back!

635
00:29:58,568 --> 00:29:59,735
You good to walk?

636
00:29:59,817 --> 00:30:00,950
- Yeah.
- I'm not.

637
00:30:00,997 --> 00:30:03,110
Come on.

638
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,198
Can you get some towels please?

639
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:18,409
- Yes. Hold on.
- Okay.

640
00:30:19,723 --> 00:30:21,724
Help me take off his vest.

641
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:24,215
He...

642
00:30:31,818 --> 00:30:34,236
Oh, my God. Is he dead?

643
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:39,584
It's okay. Just... Just breathe.

644
00:30:39,624 --> 00:30:42,426
I know that sounds cliché,
but I promise it does work.

645
00:30:43,854 --> 00:30:45,489
Have you done this before?

646
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,132
No, no.

647
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:48,999
But I aced it at the Academy.

648
00:30:50,502 --> 00:30:51,602
I know...

649
00:30:51,627 --> 00:30:53,972
Your birth plan didn't
involve a cop and your couch,

650
00:30:53,998 --> 00:30:56,025
but I promise you, I will protect you

651
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,717
and your baby. Okay?

652
00:30:57,844 --> 00:30:59,344
Okay.

653
00:30:59,644 --> 00:31:01,379
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

654
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,716
I assume this is another test.

655
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:05,513
They don't stop
just 'cause we're pinned down.

656
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:07,949
And let's face it, you'd
think less of me if they did.

657
00:31:09,602 --> 00:31:11,022
Yes. Okay.

658
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,690
- Are you sure about this?
- We can't let him bleed out.

659
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:31,023
Just don't let it turn white.

660
00:31:31,103 --> 00:31:33,134
If it's too hot, it'll do
more harm than good.

661
00:31:34,117 --> 00:31:35,937
Identify. Isolate.

662
00:31:36,048 --> 00:31:37,616
Repair or close.

663
00:31:37,683 --> 00:31:39,784
- A-Are you talking to me?
- No.

664
00:31:39,944 --> 00:31:41,363
I'm just trying to remember
how they taught us

665
00:31:41,387 --> 00:31:43,021
to cauterize an artery.

666
00:31:44,046 --> 00:31:45,423
Okay. Isolate.

667
00:31:45,953 --> 00:31:47,333
Okay.

668
00:31:47,358 --> 00:31:48,792
You ready for this?

669
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:51,062
- Here.
- Ready or not.

670
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,439
Okay.

671
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:56,867
Is it okay?

672
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,279
- No, it's still bleeding.
- You've got this.

673
00:31:58,303 --> 00:31:59,604
I-I have faith.

674
00:32:06,164 --> 00:32:07,671
Close.

675
00:32:08,418 --> 00:32:09,598
You did it.

676
00:32:09,624 --> 00:32:10,771
It won't matter if we can't get him

677
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,130
out of this building soon.

678
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:24,287
Secure the back hallway.
I'll keep an eye on the stairs.

679
00:32:26,499 --> 00:32:30,368
- Any idea what's going on?
- Code Red, man. We're locked in.

680
00:32:50,623 --> 00:32:52,324
- Who's there?! Come on!
- Right.

681
00:32:56,262 --> 00:32:57,462
Power's out.

682
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:04,091
7-Adam-15.

683
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:05,817
Officer needs help at Bronson Estates.

684
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:08,010
Officers down, multiple gunmen.

685
00:33:08,035 --> 00:33:10,844
Send airship, S.W.A.T.,
R.A.s... everything you got.

686
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:13,348
<i>7-Adam-15, roger that.
Help is on the way.</i>

687
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:15,521
Commander West, if you have a moment.

688
00:33:15,546 --> 00:33:16,635
There's something I'd like to tell you.

689
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:19,766
A distress call just came in.
Citywide, tactical alert.

690
00:33:19,838 --> 00:33:21,631
Percy, come with me.

691
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,525
Your son is one
of the officers involved.

692
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:29,610
Why are you standing there?
It's all hands on deck.

693
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:37,932
It's a girl.

694
00:33:46,476 --> 00:33:47,792
Good job, Boot.

695
00:33:52,077 --> 00:33:53,377
What's wrong?

696
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,222
Something's not right.

697
00:33:59,857 --> 00:34:01,359
Look out!

698
00:34:10,403 --> 00:34:11,903
- Come here.
- No.

699
00:34:11,938 --> 00:34:13,405
No!!

700
00:34:13,705 --> 00:34:15,372
- No!
- Hey!

701
00:34:21,137 --> 00:34:22,838
No. No!

702
00:34:22,872 --> 00:34:24,690
No! No!

703
00:34:24,753 --> 00:34:26,954
No!

704
00:34:32,982 --> 00:34:34,170
No! No!

705
00:34:34,195 --> 00:34:36,577
- Hey!
- Come on!

706
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,503
- Get him!
- Hey!

707
00:34:39,528 --> 00:34:40,941
Aah!

708
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,380
You have the right to remain silent.

709
00:34:50,405 --> 00:34:53,173
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

710
00:34:53,248 --> 00:34:54,568
You have the right
to an attorney present.

711
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,314
If you cannot afford an attorney,

712
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,115
one will be appointed to you.

713
00:35:00,189 --> 00:35:02,594
- Stop! Freeze!
- Freeze!

714
00:35:02,671 --> 00:35:05,739
On your knees. Put your hands
behind your head... now!

715
00:35:15,977 --> 00:35:17,878
- I'm out.
- Me too.

716
00:35:24,827 --> 00:35:26,127
On your stomach!

717
00:35:26,155 --> 00:35:27,674
Get down on your stomach right now!

718
00:35:27,698 --> 00:35:28,906
- Now!
- Get down!

719
00:35:28,938 --> 00:35:30,860
Do it again! Hands behind your back!

720
00:35:30,987 --> 00:35:32,721
Give me your hand! Right hand.

721
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:34,582
Don't you move.

722
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:39,550
Come on. Get up. All right.

723
00:35:40,852 --> 00:35:42,150
Dad?

724
00:35:53,282 --> 00:35:54,783
Come on.

725
00:36:00,656 --> 00:36:02,123
They're gonna take you to the hospital,

726
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:04,093
make sure everything's okay.

727
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,315
- Then what happens?
- Whatever you want.

728
00:36:06,695 --> 00:36:09,063
You're free now, Cesiah.
You and your baby.

729
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:10,605
I'll check on you later.

730
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:12,066
Thank you.

731
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:15,370
You're gonna be okay.

732
00:36:17,846 --> 00:36:19,446
Vestri?

733
00:36:25,293 --> 00:36:26,696
I just want a second with him.

734
00:36:26,742 --> 00:36:28,609
I can't think of a worse idea.

735
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:35,490
Don't let me regret this, Tim.

736
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:48,970
The woman you shot
and threw in a dumpster...

737
00:36:49,178 --> 00:36:52,213
Her name is Isabel Bradford.

738
00:36:52,421 --> 00:36:54,215
She's my wife.

739
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:57,484
I don't know what you're talking about.

740
00:36:57,706 --> 00:37:03,231
But a dead cop's wife
always makes me happy.

741
00:37:04,169 --> 00:37:05,600
She's not dead.

742
00:37:05,831 --> 00:37:07,510
And when she gets on the stand,

743
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:10,270
she's gonna put you away
for the rest of your life.

744
00:37:30,692 --> 00:37:32,193
Hey. You okay?

745
00:37:32,595 --> 00:37:35,380
- Uh, sure.
- Can we talk?

746
00:37:35,446 --> 00:37:36,559
Can it wait?

747
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:38,179
Uh, I have so much paperwork to do.

748
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,379
I'm afraid this is a little
more important than paperwork.

749
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:42,740
Um, Commander West

750
00:37:42,765 --> 00:37:44,454
knows there's something off
with my story.

751
00:37:44,479 --> 00:37:46,280
I think I should just come clean.

752
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:48,637
No.

753
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:51,433
I think he's gonna understand
that your being there

754
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,092
- had nothing...
- John. John, no.

755
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,861
He will not understand.

756
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:58,005
We lied. We'll both get fired.

757
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,093
And for what?

758
00:37:59,118 --> 00:38:00,919
So you can feel better about yourself?

759
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:03,404
The truth matters.

760
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,034
Listen to me.

761
00:38:06,115 --> 00:38:08,474
Um, the world isn't black and white.

762
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:10,734
And it won't be better
with us off the force.

763
00:38:10,766 --> 00:38:12,905
We're out there making a difference.

764
00:38:13,735 --> 00:38:15,669
Think about everybody you have helped.

765
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:18,132
Now think about
what would have happened

766
00:38:18,156 --> 00:38:19,830
if you weren't there.

767
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:24,525
Don't throw it all away
for a false moral moment.

768
00:38:32,252 --> 00:38:34,261
Yeah.

769
00:38:34,286 --> 00:38:35,394
Come in.

770
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:38,383
We wanted to update you

771
00:38:38,408 --> 00:38:40,047
on the Kyle Montgomery investigation.

772
00:38:40,296 --> 00:38:41,458
Okay.

773
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:43,991
I'm clearing you
for active duty, Officer Nolan.

774
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:46,189
- Meaning case closed?
- Yes.

775
00:38:46,515 --> 00:38:49,037
I believe Kyle Montgomery
attacked you in your home

776
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:50,563
and you acted appropriately,

777
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:53,162
using non-lethal force to subdue him.

778
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:56,677
Also, your bravery and competence today

779
00:38:56,702 --> 00:38:59,762
proves to me that you're ready
to return to the field.

780
00:39:00,515 --> 00:39:02,650
Officer Nolan, you don't seem happy.

781
00:39:02,772 --> 00:39:05,829
No. Um... I am, I am.

782
00:39:05,854 --> 00:39:07,339
I...

783
00:39:08,169 --> 00:39:09,293
Becoming a police officer

784
00:39:09,318 --> 00:39:11,320
has been one of
the most meaningful things

785
00:39:11,345 --> 00:39:12,781
I've done with my life.

786
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,155
It's just...

787
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,169
been a long couple of days.

788
00:39:17,332 --> 00:39:19,172
Well, that's understandable.

789
00:39:19,395 --> 00:39:20,929
Why don't you go home
and get some rest?

790
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,692
- Tomorrow's a new day.
- Thank you.

791
00:39:38,554 --> 00:39:40,121
Hey. I'm here.

792
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:42,390
I...

793
00:39:42,591 --> 00:39:45,137
I-I didn't know that...

794
00:39:45,354 --> 00:39:47,247
rock bottom...

795
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:50,385
had a basement.

796
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:03,875
Hey.

797
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:05,351
Hey.

798
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:07,745
Uh, I was out, trying to clear my head.

799
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:11,005
I kind of just drove here on autopilot.

800
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,319
I'm glad you did.

801
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,453
Oh, God. Tough day.

802
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:26,577
Yeah.

803
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:28,970
I heard you got cleared for duty.

804
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:30,659
Commander West closed the file.

805
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:32,686
- Good.
- It is.

806
00:40:35,184 --> 00:40:37,019
Can I admit something?

807
00:40:37,513 --> 00:40:39,040
Of course you can.

808
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:41,543
I didn't drive here on autopilot.

809
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:44,600
I, um...

810
00:40:45,514 --> 00:40:47,260
I've had a really tough day,

811
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:50,247
and I know things
are complicated between us,

812
00:40:50,272 --> 00:40:55,042
but maybe we could talk... sometimes...

813
00:40:55,224 --> 00:40:56,961
as friends?

814
00:40:58,174 --> 00:41:00,063
I would love that.

815
00:41:11,293 --> 00:41:12,593
I delivered a baby.

816
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:14,920
- That's amazing.
- Then I got shot.

817
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,403
In the vest.

818
00:41:16,899 --> 00:41:18,733
- It still counts.
- Well...

819
00:41:18,768 --> 00:41:20,605
You should see the bruise.
It's just, like...

820
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:21,727
Mm.

821
00:41:21,752 --> 00:41:23,333
Well, I'm... I'm good.

822
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:24,952
I got enough bruises of my own.

823
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:29,232
- You gonna share that beer?
- Uh, no.

824
00:41:29,311 --> 00:41:31,527
Okay.

825
00:41:36,938 --> 00:41:39,373
So, should we get some pizza?

826
00:41:39,554 --> 00:41:41,522
I already did.

827
00:41:41,756 --> 00:41:43,977
It should be here any second now.

828
00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:46,026
Wow, that's confidence.

829
00:41:46,114 --> 00:41:49,477
Well, more like hope.

830
00:41:49,771 --> 00:41:51,872
You are a sucker for pizza.

831
00:41:52,148 --> 00:41:54,115
Officer Chen, you know me too well.
