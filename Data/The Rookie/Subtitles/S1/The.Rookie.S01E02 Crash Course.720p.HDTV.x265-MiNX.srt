00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,506
Six months ago, I packed
everything I own into a U-Haul,

3
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:05,726
moved here to become a cop.

4
00:00:05,751 --> 00:00:07,380
Cholesterol level I've never
seen in a rookie.

5
00:00:07,405 --> 00:00:08,723
I'm something of a pioneer.

6
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,278
We got some new blood this morning.

7
00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:11,811
Lucy Chen, Jackson West,

8
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:14,230
and John Nolan,
who was born before disco died.

9
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:16,539
I don't give a damn about
your age. Show me what you got.

10
00:00:16,564 --> 00:00:19,366
I hate what you represent...
a walking mid-life crisis.

11
00:00:19,424 --> 00:00:22,017
LAPD isn't a place for
you to find yourself.

12
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:24,011
Everything is a test, Officer Chen,

13
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,411
and you just got another "F."

00:00:25,436 --> 00:00:27,405

Get out your gun and cover me!

18
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:37,144
If you don't have what
it takes on the streets,

19
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:38,291
then you're not a cop.

20
00:00:38,316 --> 00:00:39,792
Freeze up again, and you're done.

21
00:00:40,532 --> 00:00:41,827
I know about you and Nolan.

25
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,981
Do we need to review
high-speed pursuit protocol?

26
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:02,607
- No.
- What about that PIT maneuver

27
00:01:02,632 --> 00:01:04,500
you failed to execute two blocks ago?

28
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:06,668
Police regulations recommend
that an officer

29
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:10,027
<i>not</i> attempt a PIT maneuver
at over 35 miles an hour.

30
00:01:10,356 --> 00:01:12,738
They also state that the risk
of civilian injuries grows

31
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:15,200
exponentially with every minute
of urban pursuit.

32
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:25,139
Everything you hit requires
a separate accident report.

33
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,217
I know.

34
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:31,863

You can't let this guy ruin your life.

70
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:32,840
Too late. I lost my job, my apartment.

00:03:32,865 --> 00:03:34,999

Now you have something to live for.

81
00:03:52,738 --> 00:03:53,997
You're kidding.

82
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:56,436
No, I-I've been
where you are, you know?

83
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:58,319
Not literally. I've never
actually been up here.

84
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:00,919
It's... It's... It's pretty.

85
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:02,964
But... But I've, uh...

86
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:05,490
10 years ago, back in
Pennsylvania, my...

87
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:07,688
my construction company
was going under,

88
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:09,548
I was up to my eyeballs in debt,

89
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:12,692
tanking my marriage because
I thought I was a failure...

90
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:15,431
But I went into a liquor store

91
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,898
to buy the biggest bottle
of booze I could find

92
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:18,625
and I left it on the counter

93
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:21,409
and I bought. a lottery ticket instead.

94
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:25,843
And i-it gave me just enough hope

95
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:27,719
to make it through the bad times.

96
00:04:30,188 --> 00:04:31,855
It's been my ritual ever since.

97
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:34,256
I buy one a week, but I-I don't
need it anymore.

98
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,628
So, um...

99
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:40,883
I'm giving the hope to you.

100
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,926
I'm scared.

101
00:04:54,987 --> 00:04:56,054
I know.

102
00:04:56,215 --> 00:04:57,536
Yeah, I know.

103
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,140
But I can help you.

104
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,407
No! No!

105
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,197
Are you okay?

106
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:07,893
No!

107
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:10,488
I dropped the ticket.

108
00:05:10,696 --> 00:05:13,225
- A little help!
- Aah!

109
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:34,906
What are you thinking about?

110
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:37,719
Ending it all.

111
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,326
Something I did? Or didn't do?

112
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:45,255
What if I hadn't saved her?

113
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:46,687
But you did.

114
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:49,269
Yeah, but it could've just
easily gone the other way.

115
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:52,176
Then you would've dealt with it.

116
00:05:52,466 --> 00:05:53,919
Take the win.

117
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,854
There'll be plenty of losses
to come, you know?

118
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:01,863
Mm.

119
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:04,594
You think they'd get mad
if we called in sick week one?

120
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:06,183
Yes.

121
00:06:06,217 --> 00:06:07,591
But we could spend the day together.

122
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,226
We could do L.A. stuff, yoga.

123
00:06:10,343 --> 00:06:11,777
Yoga? You do yoga?

124
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:13,436
No, but I'm starting a new life here.

125
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,849
Maybe the new me loves yoga.

126
00:06:14,873 --> 00:06:16,226
I don't know. Maybe he hates it.

127
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:18,285
But I'd be with you.

128
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:20,125
That is painfully romantic.

129
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,642
- Right?
- Mm.

130
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,621
Sadly, if we took the same sick day,

131
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:27,444
we may give ourselves away.

132
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:30,407
Yeah.

133
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:32,926
I mean, we are surrounded by cops,

134
00:06:32,997 --> 00:06:34,864
and odds are somebody's
gonna figure it out.

135
00:06:34,998 --> 00:06:37,066
Well, we'll have to be extra sneaky.

136
00:06:38,337 --> 00:06:40,627
Am I this sore because I'm old

137
00:06:40,652 --> 00:06:41,941
or because being a cop is hard...

138
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,346
- and don't answer that.
- You're sore

139
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,118
because this job's
like running downhill

140
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:46,562
as fast as you can.

141
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:48,914
Sure, it's exciting, but one wrong step

142
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:51,074
and things get ugly, fast.

143
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:52,556
Yeah.

144
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:54,003
Except you said Tim did
everything right,

145
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:55,662
and he still got shot.

146
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:02,025
Checkout time, Officer.

147
00:07:02,595 --> 00:07:04,329
Yeah, no.

148
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:05,579
I'm walking out of here.

149
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:06,692
Hospital policy.

150
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,284
I don't care.

151
00:07:10,315 --> 00:07:12,449
So, who's picking you up?

152
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:13,777
A cab.

153
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:15,230
Is that all we are to you?

154
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:17,676
- Hey.
- You know, it's funny.

155
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:18,910
He didn't tell us he was getting out.

156
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:20,010
'Cause he's a tough guy.

157
00:07:20,035 --> 00:07:21,489
Who doesn't need anybody's help.

158
00:07:21,514 --> 00:07:22,641
Are you two finished?

159
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,716
Nope.

160
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,836
Smile.

161
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,309
Hey, how's it going?

162
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:32,849
Great.

163
00:07:34,072 --> 00:07:35,105
All right, fine.

164
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:36,637
I didn't get much sleep.

165
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:38,074
Are you worried about something?

166
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:41,555
No, no. Just, uh, excited
to get back out there.

167
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:44,948
Hey.

168
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:46,383
Did you break up with him yet?

169
00:07:46,417 --> 00:07:47,551
Uh...

170
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:51,426
Look, I appreciate you looking
out for me...

171
00:07:51,503 --> 00:07:52,970
Oh, Boot, you misunderstand.

172
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:54,591
I did you a solid.

173
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:56,149
You only get but one.

174
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,973
You want to sabotage your career
before it starts,

175
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,043
that's on you now.

176
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:06,195
Oh.

177
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:07,741
Very funny, you guys.

178
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,941
Of course, you know, this means
now I have to throw them.

179
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,989
All right, the honeymoon's over.

180
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:29,172
3, 5, 21.

181
00:08:29,447 --> 00:08:32,776
Officer Nolan, you care to guess
what these numbers represent?

182
00:08:33,545 --> 00:08:36,192
Combination to your heart, sir?

183
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:43,449
3 is the number
of opportunities you had

184
00:08:43,474 --> 00:08:46,085
to disable Runaway Bride's car
yesterday.

185
00:08:46,357 --> 00:08:50,060
5 vehicles were damaged
because you failed to do so.

186
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:52,068
And the last number.

187
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:54,115
Officer Bishop.

188
00:08:54,552 --> 00:08:57,406
$21,000 in property damage
the city has to pay.

189
00:08:57,447 --> 00:08:58,786
Correct.

190
00:08:59,777 --> 00:09:01,921
All in all,
Officer Nolan's first pursuit

191
00:09:01,946 --> 00:09:04,171
reveals room for improvement.

192
00:09:04,262 --> 00:09:05,333
Yes, sir.

193
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:06,479
Onward.

194
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:08,948
Officer Chen is in need
of a training officer

195
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:11,324
until Tim Bradford is cleared for duty.

196
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:14,551
Officer Scott Wrigley, you get the nod.

197
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:17,156
That's it. Stay safe out there.

198
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:20,528
Oh, Lopez, West,
see the captain on the way out.

199
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:26,726
- What do you think she wants?
- Nothing good.

200
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:28,375
I was reading over your report

201
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,166
on the Officer Bradford shooting.

202
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,869
First off, neither of you
had your body cams on,

203
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:34,015
which I understand.

204
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,182
You were under fire.

205
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:37,543
What I don't understand
is how Officer Lopez

206
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:40,574
emptied two magazines,
striking the suspect in the leg,

207
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:42,484
but Officer West...

208
00:09:43,161 --> 00:09:45,162
you didn't fire a single shot.

209
00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:48,749
If I may.

210
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:50,700
Officer West did not
have a protected position

211
00:09:50,755 --> 00:09:53,112
from which to fire,
so I urged him to stay down

212
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:54,987
while I engaged the suspect.

213
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,897
Is there anything that
you would like to add?

214
00:09:58,484 --> 00:09:59,883
No, ma'am.

215
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:03,809
Okay. Get back to work.

216
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:07,821
Thanks.

217
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:09,534
I didn't do it for you.

218
00:10:09,654 --> 00:10:12,438
The golden boy with the VIP dad
flunks out on my watch,

219
00:10:12,463 --> 00:10:14,017
I can wave detective goodbye.

220
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:16,700
I just hope protecting you
doesn't get me killed.

221
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:19,857
Are you sure I can't carry that?

222
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:20,964
Absolutely.

223
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:22,567
I've been on the job 12 years,

224
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:24,234
never fired my weapon.

225
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:26,950
You took on a couple
high-powered jokers,

226
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:29,108
saved your T.O. on day two.

227
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:32,338
So that makes you a rock star
in my book.

228
00:10:32,797 --> 00:10:34,764
And rock stars don't
pack-mule the gear.

229
00:10:34,946 --> 00:10:37,047
I was just trying to not get killed.

230
00:10:37,107 --> 00:10:38,792
Aww. Modest, too.

231
00:10:42,869 --> 00:10:45,105
I can see why Tim's
been boasting about you.

232
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:47,869
- He has?
- No.

233
00:10:47,952 --> 00:10:49,553
But I'm not like that.

234
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:51,532
I give credit where it's due,

235
00:10:51,636 --> 00:10:53,454
and you have earned a free pass today.

236
00:10:53,538 --> 00:10:55,528
So anything you need, just ask.

237
00:10:59,744 --> 00:11:03,714
So, just how badly. did
I mess up that pursuit?

238
00:11:03,808 --> 00:11:05,409
Average.

239
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:06,983
You hesitated to hit a car

240
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:08,875
because you spent your life
avoiding accidents.

241
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,489
Well, that's true of every rookie.

242
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:12,690
True, but you've lived longer,

243
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:15,186
which means those instincts
are harder to break.

244
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:17,389
This job is all about doing things

245
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:19,388
that run counter to human nature.

246
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:22,546
If you can't overcome your
programming, you won't make it.

247
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,959
Failure's not an option, okay?

248
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,553
I've been around guns my whole
life, never froze up before.

249
00:11:33,998 --> 00:11:36,086
It's different when
they're shooting <i>at</i> you.

250
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:38,288
Yeah. Yeah, well, now I know.

251
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:42,010
Look. It... It won't happen again.

252
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,904
Not good enough.

253
00:11:43,974 --> 00:11:45,412
I don't want to spend
every call wondering

254
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:49,205
if you're gonna freeze up again,
so today, we get proactive,

255
00:11:49,286 --> 00:11:51,848
take all the high-risk calls
and see how you do.

256
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:53,589
You better do well.

257
00:11:53,677 --> 00:11:56,775
<i>Wilshire units,

258
00:11:56,835 --> 00:11:59,970
<i>PR states man on PCP attacked a priest.</i>

260
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,851
Perfect.

261
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:06,270
7-Adam-07, responding.

262
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:13,583
A morning of rolling-stop citations

263
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,221
should take us nicely into lunch.

264
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,514
We're gonna sit here all morning?

265
00:12:17,855 --> 00:12:20,410
Hey, writing tickets
is the heart of the job.

266
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,968
Do you want to, uh,
quiz me or something?

267
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,197
Nope.

268
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:36,746
What's going on?

269
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:38,911
Blaster on PCP walked into the church,

270
00:12:38,936 --> 00:12:41,300
and threw the priest
through a stained-glass window.

271
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:42,722
Tore the place up.

272
00:12:42,747 --> 00:12:44,981
We're waiting for special ops
and a supervisor.

273
00:12:45,436 --> 00:12:46,486
Big guy?

274
00:12:46,517 --> 00:12:47,960
You could say that.

275
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,260
Okay, cool.

276
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,528
We're going in.

277
00:12:51,622 --> 00:12:52,879
We are?

278
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:56,489
I mean, hell, yeah, we are.

279
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,485
It's your funeral.

280
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:19,222
Whoa! He is a big one.

281
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,972
What do we do here, Officer West?

282
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:25,932
Phencyclidine... or PCP...
is a dissociative sedative

283
00:13:25,957 --> 00:13:28,288
that makes the user feel
invulnerable and, uh,

284
00:13:28,313 --> 00:13:30,214
sets his body temp through the roof,

285
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:32,307
which is why he took off
all his clothes.

286
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:35,055
He's basically the Hulk,
unable to feel pain.

287
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,506
If you shoot him,
it just makes him mad.

288
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:42,699
So what we need to do is calm him down.

289
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,141
I'm not looking for a dissertation.

290
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:45,288
You stop.

291
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:47,029
I want to know how you're gonna
get him into cuffs

292
00:13:47,089 --> 00:13:48,915
and then our shop.

293
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,104
- Come here!
- Carefully.

294
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:55,209
<i>7-Adam-15, vehicle on fire,</i>

295

00:13:58,531 --> 00:13:59,832

297
00:13:59,857 --> 00:14:00,984
Stay away from the flame.

298
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,600
Step back from the flame.

299
00:14:02,706 --> 00:14:04,087
What is going on?

300
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:05,475
Ma'am, did you do this?

301
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:07,710
Yeah, 'cause Fungus ripped me off.

302
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:09,480
Who's Fungus?

303
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:12,184
Fun Gus. My meth dealer.

304
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:13,743
Your meth dealer drives a Prius?

305
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:15,776
So why burn your dealer's car?

306
00:14:15,801 --> 00:14:19,719
I gave him $20 for meth, and he
only gave me 10 bucks' worth.

307
00:14:20,437 --> 00:14:21,738
Girl, that's just not right.

308
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,130
I know.

309
00:14:23,574 --> 00:14:25,789
- I work hard for my money.
- I bet you do.

310
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:28,932
So what say we go find this
Fungus and get you squared away?

311
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,661
Okay. Yeah.

312
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:34,784
Only I don't know where he's at.

313
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,740
The kid I stabbed said
this was Fungus's car.

314
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:38,281
I lit it up so he'd show.

315
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,474
Wait. You stabbed a kid?

316
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:41,493
Yeah. Fungus's brother.

317
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,860
- Turn around.
- What?

318
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,566
- Put your hands on the tree.
- He... Hey!

319
00:14:44,655 --> 00:14:46,374
Hands behind your back.

320
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,757
I got a knife here.

321
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:54,600
Blood's not even dry.

322
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,419
The kid you stabbed, he still alive?

323
00:14:56,741 --> 00:14:58,199
I don't know.

324
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:14,017
It's okay.

325
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,902
Look, I'm just gonna come
a little bit closer, okay?

326
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:21,062
Okay.

327
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:22,906
Hey, hey, no, we're good. We're good.

328
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:25,328
It's okay. We're good, right?

329
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:27,040
Listen to me, just a quick second.

330
00:15:27,144 --> 00:15:28,611
You're thirsty, right?

331
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:30,048
You got to be thirsty.

332
00:15:30,073 --> 00:15:31,798
Okay, you like water?
I can get you water...

333
00:15:31,822 --> 00:15:35,368
nice, refreshing water, right?

334
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:37,101
Just put these bracelets on.

335
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:38,336
Put these bracelets on,

336
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:40,884
and I will give you
all the water that you want.

337
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:43,552
Sweet, sweet water.

338
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:52,310
Special ops, my ass.

339
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,898
Bunch of meter maids.

340
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:04,155
Where is he? I don't see him.

341
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,390
I don't know. I stabbed him over there.

342
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,787
Bishop.

343
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,807
Is he alive?

344
00:16:19,349 --> 00:16:21,059
Skin's cool, no pulse.

345
00:16:21,099 --> 00:16:22,326
Don't feel bad for him.

346
00:16:22,351 --> 00:16:24,085
<i>I'm</i> the one who got ripped off.

347
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:27,886
7-Adam-15, our call is now a 187.

348
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,171
Have Homicide respond to our location.

349
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,500
Great morning, Officer Chen.

350
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,880
I'm gonna drop you here for lunch.

351
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:36,974
What?

352
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:39,494
Oh, uh, I like to go home
to eat, you know,

353
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,020
get these wool pants off,
air things out.

354
00:16:42,817 --> 00:16:43,867
Be back in 40.

355
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:53,327
It's just such a waste,
losing your life for so little.

356
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:54,753
See that thing you're doing right now,

357
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:56,521
looking for meaning in tragedy?

358
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:58,994
That's an old-life instinct.

359
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,186
- It's not helpful here.
- It's human.

360
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,966
So is stupidity and murder.

361
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:09,022
Why the long face, Boot?

362
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:11,033
Hey. What are you doing here?

363
00:17:11,107 --> 00:17:12,486
Heard you got Wrigley.

364
00:17:12,552 --> 00:17:14,262
He always dumps his rookies here
while he goes home

365
00:17:14,287 --> 00:17:16,367
to eat mac and cheese in his undies.

366
00:17:17,437 --> 00:17:19,411
So, what, you came to check on me?

367
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:21,721
I live around the corner.
I was getting takeout.

368
00:17:21,855 --> 00:17:23,261
Right.

369
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:24,955
So, how's it going?

370
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:26,338
It's good.

371
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:28,520
Officer Wrigley is, um...

372
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:31,604
Yeah, he's... he's cautious.

373
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:33,205
He's... He's what we call a slug...

374
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,868
just doing his time,
allergic to real police work.

375
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:37,737
Yeah. Yeah.

376
00:17:37,762 --> 00:17:39,396
You must like the quiet, though.

377
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,273
<i>Wilshire units,</i>

378
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:43,472
<i>store owner called
with suspected shoplifter.</i>

379
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:45,498
<i>Caucasian male, yellow track suit.</i>

380
00:17:45,618 --> 00:17:47,991
<i>314 Franklin Drive.</i>

381
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,484
That's three blocks from here, Boot.

382
00:17:50,044 --> 00:17:51,954
What, a-am I supposed to respond?

383
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:53,489
My T.O.'s not here,
and I don't have a car.

384
00:17:53,513 --> 00:17:55,046
You've got legs, don't you?

385
00:17:58,117 --> 00:18:00,194
7-Adam-21 responding on foot.

386
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:01,621
Uh, skipping out on the bill?

387
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,167
No, no. Right.

388
00:18:03,227 --> 00:18:05,335
Uh, whatever.

389
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,179
Run, Boot!

390
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,733
Run!

391
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,225
Hey!

392
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:16,199
Police! Stop!

393
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:18,176
Hey! Hey! Police!

394
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:19,742
Watch out, watch out.

395
00:18:19,813 --> 00:18:20,946
- Stop!
- Come on!

396
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,428
Police!

397
00:18:23,523 --> 00:18:24,623
Hey.

398
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:27,228
Stay on the ground!

399
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:28,730
Hands behind your back.

400
00:18:32,118 --> 00:18:34,519
Do your thing, girl.

401
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:37,983
All right, Officer Chen.

402
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:39,749
Show me how you process an arrest.

403
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:41,909
Uh... first...

404
00:18:41,961 --> 00:18:43,682
Take the prisoner out of the shop.

405
00:18:45,238 --> 00:18:46,813
Come on.

406
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:48,673
Then search the back seat.

407
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,111
- Next, take off...
- Shoes and socks.

408
00:18:56,161 --> 00:18:57,428
Hold the feet.

409
00:19:00,426 --> 00:19:02,581
Next, remove jewelry.

410
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:06,452
All right.

411
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:07,926
Get finger and palm prints.

412
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:10,916
And now your thumb.

413
00:19:11,457 --> 00:19:13,290
Not your thumb.

414
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,953
Still not your thumb.

415
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:17,019
Let's try the big one.

416
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:22,019
Mug-shot time.

417
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:25,364
Now turn to the right.

418
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,072
Finally, lock them up.

419
00:19:37,023 --> 00:19:38,076
Aah!

420
00:19:38,369 --> 00:19:39,794
- Aah!
- And get the watch commander...

421
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:41,267
...to sign off on all the paperwork.

422
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:42,841
Officer Chen.

423
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:47,418
Good.

424
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,025
Officer West.

425
00:19:56,588 --> 00:19:58,028
Also good.

426
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:01,993
Officer Nolan.

427
00:20:17,536 --> 00:20:19,111
Did you check this, Bishop?

428
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,685
Yes, sir.

429
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,619
Try reading more carefully next time.

430
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:24,325
Yes, sir.

431
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:27,046
Once again with feeling, Officer Nolan.

432
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,464
Yes, sir.

433
00:20:32,972 --> 00:20:34,273
Sorry.

434
00:20:38,718 --> 00:20:40,082
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.

435
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:41,990
I know you have
a problem with Nolan, but...

436
00:20:42,311 --> 00:20:44,150
I feel like I'm taking
friendly fire here.

437
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:45,675
Is that how you see it?

438
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,467
'Cause Officer Nolan's not
the only one being tested.

439
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:51,777
You're ambitious,
anxious to make detective.

440
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:53,669
Nothing wrong with that.

441
00:20:53,927 --> 00:20:56,495
Unless you're more interested
in your next job

442
00:20:56,582 --> 00:20:58,541
- than the one you got.
- No, sir.

443
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,947
Good.

444
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,575
'Cause training Officer Nolan's
gonna require you to dig deep,

445
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:07,872
and failure could impact
your promotion.

446
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:10,689
You're dismissed.

447
00:21:13,292 --> 00:21:15,019
I feel like Goldilocks.

448
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:17,252
This training officer's
too hard, this one's too soft.

449
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,409
I don't know.

450
00:21:18,434 --> 00:21:20,542
An afternoon of traffic stops
sounds good right about now.

451
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:22,969
Who are you, and what have you
done with Officer Extra Credit?

452
00:21:23,155 --> 00:21:24,860
And, yes, that's what we called
you back at the academy.

453
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,475
Always the first to volunteer,

454
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:29,414
the most prepared rookie
in the history of the LAPD.

455
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:30,715
I'm still that guy.

456
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,541
Officer West, time to go.

457
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,672
Is he okay?

458
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:39,467
Um, he said he's having
some trouble sleeping.

459
00:21:39,492 --> 00:21:41,384
I'm gonna check on him later.

460
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:42,807
Mm.

461
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,595
What?

462
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,922
You're a good guy, is all.

463
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,626
So, did you struggle as a rookie?

464
00:22:00,691 --> 00:22:01,753
No.

465
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,460
- Really?
- Yes.

466
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:06,414
This job is all about making
split-second decisions in chaos.

467
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:08,570
My childhood was pretty, uh, turbulent,

468
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:11,457
so I got really good
at reacting quickly.

469
00:22:11,816 --> 00:22:12,949
Look out!

470
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:16,372
Oh! Oh!

471
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:18,220
Ma'am, are you all right?

472
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:19,714
Just stay right there, okay?
We have an ambulance coming.

473
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:21,026
All right?

474
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:22,943
- Help! Help!
- 7-Adam-15,

475
00:22:22,968 --> 00:22:25,218
requesting an R.A. for a female,
20s, struck by a car.

476
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,522
Help me! Help me!

477
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,140
There's duct tape on her wrists.

478
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:30,611
- Don't let him get me.
- Who?

479
00:22:30,636 --> 00:22:32,416
- No, please, don't let him take me.
- Who?

480
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:33,967
Please don't let him take me again!

481
00:22:34,026 --> 00:22:36,073
- Who?!
- Oh, my God!

482
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,626
<i> Dilated pupils.</i>

483
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:39,714
- Sh-sh...
- Emma!

484
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:41,108
No, no, they're trying
to help you, okay?

485
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:42,392
She's been heavily drugged.

486
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:43,999
- Emma.
- Who... Who is Emma?

487
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:44,936
Who's Emma?

488
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:46,465
You need to get out
so we can treat her.

489
00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:48,206
No! No!

490
00:22:48,474 --> 00:22:50,625
Nurse! Officers, out, now!

491
00:22:50,733 --> 00:22:52,178
Emma!

492
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:53,337
No.

493
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,388
You okay?

494
00:22:55,434 --> 00:22:56,741
At least it can't get worse.

495
00:22:56,802 --> 00:22:59,987
See, clearly, you misinterpreted
my lecture about vehicle damage,

496
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:02,439
'cause hitting civilians is not
what I was advocating.

497
00:23:02,487 --> 00:23:04,157
Sir, it wasn't Officer Nolan's fault.

498
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:05,554
She ran in front of our shop.

499
00:23:05,623 --> 00:23:07,568
Way to go, Mad Max.

500
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,668
Officer Nolan,
Detectives Motta and Paige,

501
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:11,889
Major Assault Crimes.

502
00:23:11,914 --> 00:23:13,640
Did you manage to get an I.D.
from the photo we sent?

503
00:23:13,665 --> 00:23:15,466
I'm sorry. Does your rookie
think we work for him?

504
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,307
- Of course not.
- He's just highly motivated.

505
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,271
Christine Holbeck, 27.

506
00:23:21,296 --> 00:23:22,603
Missing-persons report was filed

507
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:24,049
by her roommate a week ago.

508
00:23:24,088 --> 00:23:25,718
Our victim happen to mention
who took her?

509
00:23:25,743 --> 00:23:27,399
No, she was drugged. She has no idea

510
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:29,225
where she was held or even
how long she was running.

511
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,321
- Before you ran her over?
- It was an accident.

512
00:23:31,456 --> 00:23:33,390
She mentioned a name... Emma.

513
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:35,439
She said she, uh...

514
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:37,915
She was sorry she left.

515
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:40,538
Could she be another victim,
someone who's still there?

516
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,620
We'll run the name,
see if anything turns up.

517
00:23:42,894 --> 00:23:44,002
Well, what can we do to help?

518
00:23:44,027 --> 00:23:45,810
Canvass while we wait for her to detox.

519
00:23:45,944 --> 00:23:48,209
Done. I'll assign Bishop
and three other units,

520
00:23:48,307 --> 00:23:49,786
get overnight to pick up the baton.

521
00:23:49,814 --> 00:23:51,581
Let's go.

522
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:56,977
Will you let me know how she's doing?

523
00:23:57,589 --> 00:23:58,789
Yeah.

524
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:05,428
I pulled a high-risk warrant to serve.

525
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:08,301
Brenner Plank, a member
of the Aryan Nation

526
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:11,191
who enjoys long walks on
the beach and felony assault.

527
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:12,631
Hope you're ready for a fight.

528
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:13,864
Can't wait.

529
00:24:16,982 --> 00:24:18,291
I don't get it.

530
00:24:18,349 --> 00:24:19,999
A woman running for her life

531
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:21,626
with duct tape around her wrists?

532
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:22,951
How does nobody see her?

533
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:24,476
It's L.A.

534
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:26,790
7-Adam-15, show us Code 6.

535
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:29,419
All right.

536
00:24:29,762 --> 00:24:31,436
13 down, 100 more to go.

537
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:34,280
How does kidnapping women
become somebody's normal?

538
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,863
Don't worry, that's a "how do we
get this guy" question,

539
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:38,098
not a search for meaning.

540
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:39,256
I know your position on that.

541
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:40,729
No, you don't.

542
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:43,540
You've been hardwired
to ask why, but out here,

543
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,399
the why is mostly irrelevant.

544
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:49,739
Look, "how we find the guy"
is the right question to ask.

545
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:52,588
But honestly, I'm not sure
you're prepared for when we do.

546
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,178
See, at some point, you're gonna
be faced with a doorway

547
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:56,649
to a very ugly place,

548
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:59,057
one people have tried to avoid
their whole lives.

549
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:01,447
Are you gonna be a cop in that moment,

550
00:25:01,472 --> 00:25:03,307
or are you gonna be a guy
who's in over his head?

551
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:08,014
<i>7-Adam-15, GTA in process.</i>

552
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,471
<i>Unknown make and model,
white and orange in color.</i>

553
00:25:10,496 --> 00:25:12,569
<i>- Details to follow.</i>
- We're not gonna respond to that.

554
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,032
Crime doesn't stop while we canvass.

555
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:15,249
No. It's just a matter of priority.

556
00:25:15,274 --> 00:25:16,925
Yeah, well, that junkie seemed
pretty low priority

557
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:18,691
till she turned out to be a murderer.

558
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:21,588
7-Adam-15, show us responding.

559
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:29,860
<i>Sir, I need you pull
the scissor lift over.</i>

560
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,831
<i>Sir, stop the lift,
and pull over right now.</i>

561
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:36,399
No.

562
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:47,202
Sir, that scissor lift
is not street legal.

563
00:25:47,272 --> 00:25:48,320
And you stole it.

564
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:49,624
- Right.
- Should've opened with that.

565
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:51,582
I didn't steal it. I liberated it.

566
00:25:51,623 --> 00:25:54,258
Supervisor owes me two weeks'
pay, so I'm gonna pawn this.

567
00:25:54,332 --> 00:25:55,697
Unfortunately, it
doesn't work like that.

568
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,517
I need you to stop the lift
and come down.

569
00:25:57,696 --> 00:26:00,450
- No.
- Sir, I do not have time for this.

570
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:02,426
- Nolan.
- Stop the vehicle.

571
00:26:02,481 --> 00:26:03,915
Sir, I don't have time for this.

572
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,374
You're escalating the situation.

573
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:07,617
Do not hit that... Si...

574
00:26:15,794 --> 00:26:17,228
It's gonna be a lot
of paperwork, isn't it?

575
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:18,613
Yeah.

576
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,728
Too bad he wasn't home.

577
00:26:29,908 --> 00:26:31,809
I was in the mood to hook an Aryan up.

578
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:34,625
Oh, we're gonna go right back.

579
00:26:34,652 --> 00:26:37,588
Just need you to grab snacks
first, definitely some caffeine.

580
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:40,053
Copy that.

581
00:26:45,123 --> 00:26:46,265
Bathroom?

582
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,838
Thank you.

583
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,174
Do I need a key for the bathroom?

584
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:12,369
Thank you.

585
00:27:19,356 --> 00:27:21,024
Police!

586
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:43,972
Ohh!

587
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,971
West!

588
00:28:03,439 --> 00:28:05,826
We should be out there looking.

589
00:28:06,132 --> 00:28:07,966
You're part of a team now.

590
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:09,691
Overnight has units canvassing,

591
00:28:09,716 --> 00:28:12,512
and you'll be on it
when your shift starts.

592
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,814
Tell me this, and be honest.

593
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:17,154
- Hm?
- Am I too set in my ways?

594
00:28:17,357 --> 00:28:19,721
- No.
- You changed your whole life,

595
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:21,697
moved across the country
to become a cop.

596
00:28:21,737 --> 00:28:22,938
Yeah, but that's all external.

597
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,437
Talia thinks my age makes me
risk-averse

598
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:27,651
and less able to change
and over-invested

599
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:28,910
in helping this girl.

600
00:28:28,935 --> 00:28:31,110
I'm sure I'd feel just as
invested if I'd, you know...

601
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:32,658
Hit a kidnap victim with your car?

602
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,284
Oh, my God, I just hate
saying it out loud.

603
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:35,757
Okay, look.

604
00:28:35,905 --> 00:28:38,945
You want to help everyone.

605
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:40,538
That's why you joined the force.

606
00:28:40,563 --> 00:28:42,898
But the hardest thing
for any rookie to learn

607
00:28:42,923 --> 00:28:45,057
is that we can't.

608
00:28:46,521 --> 00:28:47,889
Yeah?

609
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,164
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

610
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,219
Why don't we ever stay at your place?

611
00:28:52,418 --> 00:28:54,209
Because I live in a one-bedroom

612
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:55,701
with a view of a methadone clinic.

613
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:57,704
Oh, right.

614
00:28:57,884 --> 00:29:00,701
How come I've never met this
mystery landlord of yours?

615
00:29:00,727 --> 00:29:02,208
Because he's in Spain.

616
00:29:02,315 --> 00:29:04,449
No, um, China.

617
00:29:05,064 --> 00:29:06,664
I actually have no idea where he is.

618
00:29:06,693 --> 00:29:08,193
After college, his trust fund vested,

619
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:10,485
and he just never stopped moving.

620
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:14,013
But the upside is, I get
to live here for free,

621
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:15,354
and it works out for both of us.

622
00:29:15,388 --> 00:29:16,461
- Hmm.
- Speaking of which,

623
00:29:16,486 --> 00:29:18,219
you could keep some of your things here

624
00:29:18,244 --> 00:29:20,475
so you don't have to always just
run home in the morning.

625
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:22,919
I know.

626
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:25,700
I just think we should,
um, keep it casual.

627
00:29:29,381 --> 00:29:31,892
Her name is Emma Vasquez.

628
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:33,840
Reported missing three weeks ago.

629
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,535
Detectives think she's the one
that Christine left behind.

630
00:29:36,682 --> 00:29:38,407
I've approved extra shifts and O.T.

631
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,559
until we find this girl.

632
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:42,062
Everyone canvasses
between calls. Anything else?

633
00:29:42,108 --> 00:29:43,362
Yes, one more thing.

634
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:44,950
Officer Nolan.

635
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:46,974
The motor pool is considering
taking out a hit on you

636
00:29:47,027 --> 00:29:49,253
for all the damage you've caused
to their vehicles.

637
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:53,279
I talked them into, uh,
a different solution.

638
00:29:58,424 --> 00:30:00,826
Sweet.

639
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,167
Try not to damage her, huh?

640
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,540
I'm never gonna live this down.

641
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:10,022
You're welcome?

642
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:15,249
You know, I was thinking maybe
we should go to the hospital

643
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:16,520
before we start canvassing,

644
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:18,300
just to see if Christine
remembers anything.

645
00:30:18,353 --> 00:30:19,586
Detectives are on that.

646
00:30:19,611 --> 00:30:20,944
Yeah, I checked the detectives' table.

647
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,221
Motta and Paige are actually
working a lead right now.

648
00:30:23,494 --> 00:30:24,754
Emma cannot wait.

649
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:48,918
6-P-C-I-4-8 and a 1.

650
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:51,406
Do you like this kind of policing?

651
00:30:51,577 --> 00:30:53,678
I like going home to my family.

652
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,731
My kids like having a dad.

653
00:30:58,058 --> 00:30:59,697
Your training officer got shot,

654
00:30:59,753 --> 00:31:02,455
and you still don't realize
how close to dying you came.

655
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:04,324
Yeah, I do.

656
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:06,566
And yet you're still
anxious to get back out there,

657
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:10,002
which means deep down,
a part of you liked it.

658
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:13,490
That's not me, so I write the tickets,

659
00:31:13,515 --> 00:31:15,670
I take the low-risk calls
so cops like you

660
00:31:15,695 --> 00:31:17,195
can get your thrill on.

661
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:19,915
He grabbed me in the garage.

662
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:24,683
Must've snuck in after I pulled inside.

663
00:31:26,422 --> 00:31:27,655
I never saw him.

664
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:29,599
Just felt a needle go in my neck,

665
00:31:29,624 --> 00:31:31,225
and then everything went black.

666
00:31:31,285 --> 00:31:33,700
Do you remember anything
about the house?

667
00:31:34,121 --> 00:31:36,564
He kept me in the basement with Emma...

668
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:41,234
...wore a mask when he came to see us.

669
00:31:42,048 --> 00:31:44,449
I don't think it was
because he was gonna let us go.

670
00:31:44,643 --> 00:31:46,991
I think he liked it.

671
00:31:50,254 --> 00:31:52,021
Anything else?

672
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:54,989
Anything that can help us
find this place?

673
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,767
It sounds crazy, but I...

674
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:07,112
I heard a voice saying "wait"
over and over, day and night.

675
00:32:07,327 --> 00:32:11,244
Emma couldn't hear it, but
I could swear it was there.

676
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:13,899
What are you doing?

677
00:32:15,832 --> 00:32:17,187
I'll come check on you later.

678
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:18,481
We came by on our way to canvass.

679
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:20,206
Protocol is key here, Talia.

680
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:21,606
Everything goes through us.

681
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:22,986
- You know that.
- Hey, what is the problem here?

682
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,507
We're all trying to catch the same guy.

683
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,911
Why is your boot talking?

684
00:32:25,975 --> 00:32:27,908
- Again with this?
- It's all good.

685
00:32:28,415 --> 00:32:29,895
Let's get to work.

686
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:36,526
What is their problem?

687
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:37,885
They think they're better than us.

688
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:39,969
When you make detective,
are you gonna behave like that?

689
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:41,276
Hell, yeah.

690
00:32:41,354 --> 00:32:43,155
But it'll actually be true.

691
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,626
You got something?

692
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:46,745
I think I might know what the voice is.

693
00:32:46,947 --> 00:32:50,071
<i>Wait. Wait. Wait.</i>

694
00:32:50,349 --> 00:32:53,306
<i>Wait. Walk. Walk.</i>

695
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:55,613
It's called an
accessible pedestrian signal,

696
00:32:55,673 --> 00:32:57,688
designed for the visually impaired.

697
00:32:58,004 --> 00:33:00,406
And there's only one
on our search grid,

698
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:02,591
'cause there's a school for the
blind right around the corner.

699
00:33:02,615 --> 00:33:04,713
Our guy's house would have
to be right here

700
00:33:04,738 --> 00:33:07,008
in order to hear that voice
from a basement.

701
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:10,154
And I would peg that one
for mid-century kidnapper.

702
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,081
Let's ask the neighbors first.

703
00:33:15,154 --> 00:33:17,065
Security guys are always nosy.

704
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:23,201
<i>Walk. Walk. Walk.</i>

705
00:33:23,226 --> 00:33:24,722
7-Adam-15,

706
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:26,705
- show us Code 6 and out of our vehicle.
<i>- Walk. Walk. Walk.</i>

707
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:28,207
3017 Bailey Avenue.

708
00:33:28,241 --> 00:33:29,608
<i>Walk.</i>

709
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:31,882
<i>Walk. Walk.</i>

710
00:33:32,045 --> 00:33:34,346
<i>Walk. Walk.</i>

711
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,292
<i>Walk. Walk. Walk.</i>

712
00:33:37,737 --> 00:33:38,885
Hello, there, sir.

713
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:40,684
Good morning. How can I help you?

714
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:43,065
Ah, your neighbor over there,
across the street on the corner,

715
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,088
- do you know him at all?
- Yeah, yeah.

716
00:33:45,113 --> 00:33:47,080
Um, yeah, he doesn't get out much.

717
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,887
Uh, kind of keeps to himself.

718
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,599
All right. And, uh, what
about these two girls?

719
00:33:52,624 --> 00:33:53,894
You seen them around?

720
00:33:54,026 --> 00:33:56,194
No. Uh, are... are they okay?

721
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:01,763
Well, we sure hope so.

722
00:34:02,386 --> 00:34:03,807
Nolan!

723
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,652
Nolan!

724
00:34:08,677 --> 00:34:09,744
I'm going in!

725
00:34:25,698 --> 00:34:27,932
7-Adam-15 requesting help.

726
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,101
<i>Shots fired, 2311 Bailey Avenue.</i>

727
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:31,997
7-Adam-21 responding.

728
00:34:32,428 --> 00:34:35,007
I'm going, whether you're in
the car with me or not, so...

729
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:40,690
Nolan!

730
00:35:42,553 --> 00:35:44,100
Emma?

731
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,062
It's the police. Emma?

732
00:35:51,676 --> 00:35:52,878
I'm Officer Nolan, Emma.

733
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:54,362
- Please help me.
- I'm here to get you.

734
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,311
Look out!

735
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:01,910
No, no. No, no, no, no.

736
00:36:02,124 --> 00:36:03,758
No. No.

737
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:10,120
No. No, no, no, no.

738
00:36:16,976 --> 00:36:18,507
No, don't leave me, please!

739
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:21,501
Shh. It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

740
00:36:28,484 --> 00:36:29,739
Whoa, hey, are you okay?

741
00:36:29,765 --> 00:36:30,842
Yeah. He's on the move.

742
00:36:30,902 --> 00:36:32,189
I need someone to stay with Emma.

743
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:33,297
I'll do it.

744
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:35,559
7-Adam-21...
need an R.A. and supervisor

745
00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:37,025
at 3017 Bailey Avenue.

746
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:47,118
Suspect heading east
on foot into Rosedale Cemetery.

747
00:36:47,216 --> 00:36:49,200
Send backup and airship.

748
00:36:57,906 --> 00:36:59,039
Stay down!

749
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,497
Freeze!

750
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:19,517
Don't move!

751
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,344
Nolan!

752
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,769
That's enough.

753
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:25,946
He's done.

754
00:37:28,151 --> 00:37:30,118
Hook him up.

755
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:32,414
Okay.

756
00:37:41,482 --> 00:37:42,591
They should've called us

757
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:44,359
before they went
into the suspect's house.

758
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,585
Why?

759
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:46,812
'Cause it's our investigation.

760
00:37:46,912 --> 00:37:48,635
Last I checked,
it was <i>my</i> investigation,

761
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,648
and a girl's life was at stake.

762
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:52,671
And come to think of it, I think
you should be thanking them

763
00:37:52,695 --> 00:37:55,463
for rescuing the girl
and closing your case.

764
00:37:59,868 --> 00:38:01,001
Thank you.

765
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:02,810
Don't mention it.

766
00:38:06,287 --> 00:38:07,668
Look at that.

767
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:10,009
Isn't that nice,
all my kids getting along?

768
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,566
You two, get out.

769
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,675
Got to admit it, that felt pretty good.

770
00:38:18,768 --> 00:38:20,426
You should
temper yourself, Officer Bishop.

771
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,772
May I remind you, you drove
your shop into a house.

772
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:25,170
Give me a minute with Officer Nolan.

773
00:38:25,194 --> 00:38:26,627
Yes, ma'am.

774
00:38:31,947 --> 00:38:33,184
How are you doing?

775
00:38:33,281 --> 00:38:34,424
Okay.

776
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:40,148
I've always known
that people can be capable

777
00:38:40,182 --> 00:38:42,872
of horrible things, but to
see it firsthand was...

778
00:38:46,255 --> 00:38:47,956
Can't let it infect you.

779
00:38:48,816 --> 00:38:50,916
Look, as a civilian,
you can be driven by emotion,

780
00:38:50,941 --> 00:38:54,129
but as a cop, you rise above it.

781
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:56,867
It is not your job to punish
that man for what he did.

782
00:38:56,892 --> 00:38:58,324
Do you understand?

783
00:38:59,575 --> 00:39:02,917
Overcoming that impulse
will be the hardest thing

784
00:39:02,942 --> 00:39:04,761
that you do in this job.

785
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:09,058
Have a good night.

786
00:39:10,452 --> 00:39:12,587
Nice work today, Officer West.

787
00:39:14,316 --> 00:39:16,420
Thank you.

788
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:18,562
You took a very bad man off the street,

789
00:39:19,241 --> 00:39:20,517
proved you got some fight in you.

790
00:39:22,291 --> 00:39:24,759
So, this mean we're good or...?

791
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:26,213
No.

792
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:30,443
But we're getting there.

793
00:39:57,893 --> 00:39:59,461
All right. Keep it safe.

794
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:00,791
One ticket at a time.

795
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:05,299
Great working with you, Officer Chen.

796
00:40:06,721 --> 00:40:08,960
Yeah. You, too, sir.

797
00:40:09,338 --> 00:40:11,046
♪ I sleep, eat culture

798
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:12,313
I'm cleared for duty.

799
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,735
Turned in my paperwork.

800
00:40:14,554 --> 00:40:15,636
Oh.

801
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:19,819
You had me assigned to him, didn't you?

802
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:22,441
Everything is a test, Officer Chen.

803
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:24,385
Lucky for you, you passed this one.

804
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:26,078
Now, if you had been cool
half-assing it with Wrigley,

805
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:27,160
then I'd know you weren't serious

806
00:40:27,184 --> 00:40:28,256
about becoming a good cop.

807
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:33,262
With all due respect, sir,
you're a pain in my ass.

808
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,812
That's my job.

809
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:37,512
Now, get some rest.

810
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,956
See you tomorrow.

811
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:42,761
♪ Truth is I can't stay safe

812
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:50,507
Last one.

813
00:40:50,587 --> 00:40:51,746
Good job today.

814
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,749
Thank you, sir.

815
00:40:56,217 --> 00:40:59,511
Most rookies spend the first
few months with blinders on,

816
00:40:59,945 --> 00:41:02,271
but you looked out for that girl.

817
00:41:02,538 --> 00:41:06,407
And as a present for your
maturity, I got your paperwork.

818
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:09,540
Police report, property damage report,

819
00:41:09,724 --> 00:41:13,099
use of force report, pursuit memo...

820
00:41:13,172 --> 00:41:15,937
- Thank you.
- ...and collision memo.

821
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,972
Godspeed.

822
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:26,281
- Sorry.
- He didn't get you anything.

823
00:41:26,834 --> 00:41:28,294
Yeah, he did.

824
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:30,784
What are you doing?

825
00:41:30,898 --> 00:41:31,953
Helping.

826
00:41:43,279 --> 00:41:45,246
Ah. Hey.

827
00:41:47,134 --> 00:41:49,248
It's, um... Officer Nolan.

828
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:52,783
Did something happen?

829
00:41:52,907 --> 00:41:54,809
Yeah. Uh, we caught him.

830
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:56,290
Emma's safe.

831
00:42:00,709 --> 00:42:02,810
Thank you.

832
00:42:02,952 --> 00:42:04,118
Thank you.

833
00:42:07,529 --> 00:42:08,696
I don't understand.

834
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:10,216
I mean, how did you do this?

835
00:42:10,241 --> 00:42:11,675
This shop is brand-new.

836
00:42:11,794 --> 00:42:13,967
Bribery.

837
00:42:14,236 --> 00:42:15,703
So please drive very carefully.

838
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:17,336
