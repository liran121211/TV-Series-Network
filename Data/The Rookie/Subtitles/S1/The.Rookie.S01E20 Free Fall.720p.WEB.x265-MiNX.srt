1
00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:01,632
You left your foster brother,

2
00:00:01,693 --> 00:00:03,808
a known felon,
off your PHQ.

3
00:00:03,895 --> 00:00:06,300
I have a lot to be sorry for.
And I am.

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,360
I need someone here
to be my eyes and ears.

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:10,379
You want me to be a rat
for Internal Affairs?

6
00:00:10,467 --> 00:00:12,590
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Your father.

7
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:14,002
Not the one that
I thought you were.

8
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:15,700
- We can cut him off in the plaza.
- Wait!

9
00:00:15,787 --> 00:00:17,040
Brake!

10
00:00:18,724 --> 00:00:20,707
When I pushed
to be something I'm not,

11
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:21,981
I almost got someone
killed.

12
00:00:22,069 --> 00:00:23,942
The least impressive thing
about you

13
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,573
is you're dating
a 45-year-old rookie.

14
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:27,919
What's wrong with that?

15
00:00:28,007 --> 00:00:30,442
Until I administer
the oral exam,

16
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,247
get the hell
out of my office.

17
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,673
What's a 314?

18
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,917
Uh, indecent exposure.

19
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:41,559
Nice. A 273g?

20
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:43,638
Being intoxicated
in the presence of a child.

21
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:45,294
Well done.
Reminds me of a funny story.

22
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:46,967
- Mm, mm-hmm, uh-huh.
- Which is for later.

23
00:00:47,054 --> 00:00:48,825
- How about a 237?
- False imprisonment.

24
00:00:48,925 --> 00:00:52,378
Nicely done, and a personal
favorite of mine... a 597h.

25
00:00:52,474 --> 00:00:54,877
Unlawfully attaching
a propeller to an animal

26
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:56,419
so that dogs
may chase it.

27
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:59,386
Well done. That's 500 penal
codes down, 1,000 to go.

28
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:01,442
- Curly fries?
- Yes. - Definitely.

29
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:04,255
Money. Now.

30
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:06,364
211, armed robbery.

31
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,286
488, petty theft.

32
00:01:08,374 --> 00:01:10,395
- You a cop?
- Yes, I am. And so are they.

33
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:11,816
Hands in the air.
Drop your guns.

34
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:13,277
- Turn around.
- Turn around.

35
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:16,157
You guys, this looks to me like
a criminal conspiracy.

36
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,547
You mean a 182.

37
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:18,849
Also a 12-0-20.

38
00:01:18,937 --> 00:01:20,481
Oh, illegal possession
of a firearm.

39
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:23,489
Actually, it's a 417.
The guns are fake.

40
00:01:26,074 --> 00:01:27,694
Ha!
He's right!

41
00:01:27,782 --> 00:01:30,207
Yep, but this knife's real,
and that's a violation of...

42
00:01:30,295 --> 00:01:31,929
- 21510 B.
- 21510 B.

43
00:01:32,017 --> 00:01:34,351
- <i>♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>
- Turn around.

44
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:35,726
<i>♪ Whoa, oh, oh ♪</i>

45
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,702

You are trouble.

49
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:47,891
Why is that?

50
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,937
'Cause I'm supposed to be
focused on this test,

51
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:53,007
and all I can... think about...
Oh, my God... is you.

52
00:01:53,095 --> 00:01:55,138
And now you're gonna be
moving here full time.

53
00:01:55,554 --> 00:01:58,378
Yeah, well, that job
at Homeland Security

54
00:01:58,465 --> 00:02:00,030
was too good to pass up.

55
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:03,507
Plus, decent benefits.

56
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:04,812
Oh.

57
00:02:04,998 --> 00:02:06,054
- Oh.
- Oh.

58
00:02:06,142 --> 00:02:07,413
Oh.

59
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,823
Come house hunting with me
this weekend.

60
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:11,960
Yeah, sounds fun.
I'd love to.

61
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:14,841
Oh, uh, Henry's flying in.
You two can finally meet.

62
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:16,328
Is that too soon?

63
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,851
I'm sorry. I have no idea
the single dad rules yet.

64
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,827
No, no.
It's... It's fine.

65
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,123
Um...

66
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,098
I'd... I'd...
I'd like to meet him.

67
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:25,569
- Great.
- Yeah, good.

68
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:26,804
Okay. I gotta go.

69
00:02:26,892 --> 00:02:30,116
You are gonna do great
on your test.

70
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,783
- Thank you.
- Okay?

71
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:41,523
Officer Bishop.

72
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:43,674
Glad you called.

73
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:45,444
I was worried
you were ignoring me.

74
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,960
No, ma'am.
I was just weighing my options.

75
00:02:48,216 --> 00:02:49,538
And?

76
00:02:52,815 --> 00:02:55,207
You promise I'll be cleared
by the Chief

77
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:56,835
if I spy on
my fellow officers?

78
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:58,507
Don't look at it
as spying.

79
00:02:58,618 --> 00:03:01,608
You're helping me monitor cops
who cross the line.

80
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,960
Like the line
you're crossing with me.

81
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:06,640
Violating the Peace Officers
Bill of Rights.

82
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:08,827
What are you doing?

83
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:11,038
I thought hard
about your offer,

84
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:14,226
but I decided to go
a different way.

85
00:03:14,857 --> 00:03:16,593
By calling your boss.

86
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:18,878
Sir, I can explain.

87
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,069
You can try.

88
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:21,312
But I recommend
you do it

89
00:03:21,412 --> 00:03:24,187
after consulting
your union lawyer.

90
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,468
I've spoken
to the Chief.

91
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:30,288
Your case has been closed,
Officer Bishop.

92
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:33,819
A formal letter of reprimand
will be placed in your file.

93
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:38,476
My apologies for Officer Ruiz's
rogue actions.

94
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:40,175
Let's go.

95
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:47,194
Letter of reprimand...
Fair resolution.

96
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:48,546
Should be grateful.

97
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:50,093
I am.

98
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:52,804
Good.

99
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:57,917
80 might be
the passing grade, Boot,

100
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,172
but if you don't get
at least a 90,

101
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:01,003
you should turn in your badge
on general principle.

102
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,843
Officer Chen, I will take it
as a personal insult

103
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:06,174
- if you get anything less than a 93.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:07,885
Have you figured out
what you're gonna do

105
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:09,057
with all your new
free time?

106
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:10,608
Might I suggest
a book club?

107
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:11,757
What are you
talking about?

108
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:13,390
You know, after I pass,

109
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,648
there won't be any more
daily evaluations to write.

110
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:19,215
Whether I evaluate you
daily or weekly,

111
00:04:19,303 --> 00:04:21,523
I will continue to judge you
every minute.

112
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:24,085
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

113
00:04:24,424 --> 00:04:27,608
So, all right.
Big day ahead.

114
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:31,804
Rookies will work the first six
hours of their shift on patrol,

115
00:04:31,892 --> 00:04:33,585
then come back
to take the written test.

116
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:36,184
Hey, try not to tire them out
this morning.

117
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:37,676
Just take
the easy calls, okay?

118
00:04:37,786 --> 00:04:39,296
I don't do easy.

119
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:44,272
But you do follow
direct orders,

120
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:46,838
am I right,
Officer Bradford?

121
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:48,168
Yes, sir.

122
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,878
Good.

123
00:04:49,965 --> 00:04:51,529
Easy, then.

124
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,123
Following
the written exam,

125
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,674
you three will report
to the Chief's office,

126
00:04:56,762 --> 00:04:59,715
where he will personally
administer the oral exam.

127
00:04:59,862 --> 00:05:03,389
Remember, he can fail you for
a dozen different reasons, so...

128
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:06,531
Remind me, Officer Nolan,
how the Chief feels about you.

129
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:08,225
Oh, big fan, sir.

130
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:10,115
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

131
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:12,670
All right, see you three
back here in six hours.

132
00:05:12,845 --> 00:05:14,240
All right, that's it.

133
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:19,417
You're driving today,
Officer West.

134
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:20,922
I am? Why?

135
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,882
'Cause we both know
you're gonna pass the exam.

136
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,223
I mean, I feel
pretty good, but...

137
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:28,117
The rules and regulations of
the LAPD are part of your DNA.

138
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:31,039
You're right.
Test's in the bag.

139
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,343
Which means I have today
to decide whether

140
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:35,789
to request you be assigned
to a new training officer.

141
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:38,005
What? Why?

142
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:42,109
Because I feel like
I failed you.

143
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,063
You were a mess
right out of the gate.

144
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:46,234
And I thought
I got you past it.

145
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:48,656
But then you lost it again
last week.

146
00:05:48,855 --> 00:05:50,781
So either you're falling down
or I am.

147
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:52,872
What happened last week
was my fault.

148
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,289
I let my family drama
get in the way, and...

149
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:58,304
- it won't happen again.
- It's not good enough.

150
00:05:58,437 --> 00:05:59,758
You shouldn't still
be struggling with

151
00:05:59,845 --> 00:06:02,093
the most basic question...
"Why am I here?"

152
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:04,765
Why do you want to be a cop,
Officer West?

153
00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:07,562
Because I've always
wanted to be one.

154
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:12,172
Being groomed for this
isn't the same as choosing it.

155
00:06:12,652 --> 00:06:14,773
You gotta want this job
for the right reason.

156
00:06:15,032 --> 00:06:17,531
For you,
not your father.

157
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:20,015
So, why did you
choose it?

158
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:27,224
I have
four older brothers.

159
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,159
Guess it gave me
a pathological need

160
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:30,869
to stand up
for the little guy.

161
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:33,354
Which is why I was also
willing to dig deep with you.

162
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:36,443
But maybe I've given you
too much leash.

163
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,120
Maybe you need
a different instructor

164
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,349
to get your head on
straight.

165
00:06:39,437 --> 00:06:41,943
I don't want
a different instructor.

166
00:06:42,396 --> 00:06:44,427
Look, just tell me
what I have to do.

167
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:47,552
You never got
a real Plain Clothes Day.

168
00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:50,917
So this morning
you're gonna run things.

169
00:06:52,463 --> 00:06:54,206
Then we'll see
what happens.

170
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,917
<i>7-Adam-19,
silent hold-up alarm</i>

171
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:02,218
<i>activated at Madame Megan's
Psychic Shop.</i>

172
00:07:02,306 --> 00:07:04,565

173
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:09,596

Tell me right now!

174
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,628
How the hell
did you know?!

175
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:12,761
Answer me!

176
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,142
Police.
Drop the snow globe.

177
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,813
That's a $900
crystal ball.

178
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:18,724
Can he just
put it down instead?

179
00:07:19,081 --> 00:07:21,135
You heard her.
Gently.

180
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,995
Up against the wall.
Turn around.

181
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:27,462
Ma'am, you okay?

182
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,282
Yeah.

183
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:30,998
I was just giving
that psycho a reading,

184
00:07:31,085 --> 00:07:32,587
and he hulked out.

185
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:33,876
Don't say another word.

186
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:36,048
We've got psychic-client
confidentiality.

187
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:37,899
That's not a thing,
asshat.

188
00:07:37,987 --> 00:07:39,356
So, what exactly
were you telling him

189
00:07:39,443 --> 00:07:40,441
when he attacked you?

190
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:41,783
We were talking about
his love life.

191
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,110
I said I saw an image of him
and a beautiful woman

192
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:46,165
surrounded by trees,
and then he freaked out.

193
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:48,454
Why is that, sir?
Strike a little close to home?

194
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:49,956
Have you been in the woods
with a woman recently?

195
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:52,071
No, it was just
a misunderstanding.

196
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:55,020
Control,
run a name for me.

197
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,401
Last name Fischer,
first name Randy L.

198
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,360
Suspected
on a domestic.

199
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:02,297
<i>7-Adam-19, be advised
suspect's wife</i>

200
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:04,079
<i>was reported missing
six weeks ago.</i>

201
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:05,378
Hands behind your back.

202
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,298
Holy crap.
I was just making that up.

203
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:08,423
You were?

204
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:10,009
You think if I were
really psychic

205
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:11,393
that I'd be working out
of a moldy storefront

206
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,634
in Hollywood?

207
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:17,102
Although, I can totally see us
destroying my bedroom later.

208
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:19,048
Um...

209
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:30,547
<i>7-Adam-15,
report of a dead body,</i>

210
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,168
<i>Seventh Street
bus terminal.</i>

211
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,501
- At least it's behind you.
- Behind me?

212
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,494
Please, that letter of reprimand
is a permanent red flag.

213
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:39,405
It'll affect every promotion
I go in for.

214
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:40,814
You say tomato.

215
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:43,126
Uh, you reported
finding a dead body?

216
00:08:43,214 --> 00:08:44,439
Yeah, he's in
the men's room.

217
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:46,334
Must've come in on
the late bus from Phoenix...

218
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:47,923
After the cleaning crew
went through.

219
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:49,811
All right. We'll take it
from here. Thank you.

220
00:09:02,837 --> 00:09:04,356
Definitely a homicide.

221
00:09:04,506 --> 00:09:05,611
Glove up.

222
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,165
Find an I.D.
Don't touch anything else.

223
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,286
Control, run a party.

224
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,744
Last of Valance,
first of Corey.

225
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:25,163
D.O.B. 4/14/97, and notify a
supervisor and homicide unit.

226
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:26,455
Copy that.

227
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:28,463
At least we know what
we're doing until the test.

228
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,017
Yeah.

229
00:09:30,158 --> 00:09:31,580
Waiting.

230
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:40,248
Sit on the bench.

231
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:43,361
I thought I told you
to take it easy.

232
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:44,532
We did.

233
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,798
Officer West
spotted these two

234
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:46,958
trying to steal an ATM

235
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,251
from the Save Mart
on Cahuenga.

236
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:49,915
Writing it up as a 211?

237
00:09:50,003 --> 00:09:51,040
No, sir.

238
00:09:51,161 --> 00:09:52,915
Technically, it's considered
a bank burglary,

239
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:54,075
not a robbery.

240
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:55,286
Very good.

241
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:56,997
Sir, can I ask you
something?

242
00:09:57,314 --> 00:09:58,611
Okay.

243
00:09:59,255 --> 00:10:00,634
Why'd you become a cop?

244
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:02,731
I gave him
a little homework.

245
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:04,087
Easy day and all.

246
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:08,197
I liked the teamwork.
I missed it after the Army.

247
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:11,173
<i>I need those files right now.</i>

248
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,869
Excuse me.

249
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,693
Hey.

250
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:18,259
Hey.
How's it going?

251
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:19,822
Better now.

252
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:22,861
So, listen, I can probably
duck out of here early...

253
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:25,126
Jackson's got an exam
this afternoon.

254
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,197
Any way you can clear your
schedule for some us time?

255
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:30,788
Actually,
I think I can.

256
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:32,372
Really?

257
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,753
Yeah.

258
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,251
Call me
when you're off.

259
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:40,789
You ever dated a guy
with a kid?

260
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:42,703
Relax.
This is about Jessica.

261
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,455
I think
I freaked her out today

262
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:46,267
suggesting she meet Henry.

263
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:49,267
I doubt it. My guess is nothing
freaks that woman out.

264
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,056
What the hell?

265
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:55,126
Hey, you stepped in
a bit of a wasp nest.

266
00:10:55,244 --> 00:10:57,624
Did either of you
touch the body?

267
00:10:57,711 --> 00:10:59,754
He did. With gloves on
to get the wallet.

268
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:01,374
Is that all
that you touched?

269
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:04,476
Yes. Why?
You're freaking me out.

270
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,564
Wait. That is
an active crime scene.

271
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:07,874
Well, that's secondary
right now.

272
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:09,874
Hi. I'm Dr. Morgan
from the CDC.

273
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,414
Are you sure you didn't come
into contact with the victim's

274
00:11:11,501 --> 00:11:13,820
mouth, saliva,
or any bodily fluids?

275
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:15,031
Yeah, I'm sure.

276
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,204
No sign of infection.
Infection?

277
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,812
Your murder victim is part of
a homegrown terror cell

278
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,374
that the DHS
has been tracking,

279
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,314
and we believe
that they're planning

280
00:11:23,402 --> 00:11:27,447
a deadly biological attack
on the City of Los Angeles.

281
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,173
Okay, so, here is
what we know.

282
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:36,634
At 10:00 last night, this man...
Corey Valance...

283
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,484
Boarded a bus
from Phoenix to L.A.

284
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,757
He had a partner with him.

285
00:11:39,845 --> 00:11:41,634
We have no identification
on that man,

286
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:44,476
but we do know that they're part
of a fringe nationalist group

287
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:46,806
which believes
that Los Angeles stands for

288
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:48,908
everything that is wrong
in America.

289
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:51,242
The two men arrived
here at 5:00 this morning.

290
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,609
We believe Corey's partner
strangled him

291
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:55,296
in the bus station bathroom
right after.

292
00:11:55,384 --> 00:11:56,702
You thinking Corey
got cold feet?

293
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,294
It seems likely, yes,

294
00:11:58,381 --> 00:12:00,524
especially since they came here
with this deadly virus.

295
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:02,414
Well, that explains the
Silkwood shower we just took.

296
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:03,689
That was purely
a precaution.

297
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:05,874
There is no evidence
that the biological agent

298
00:12:05,962 --> 00:12:07,422
they were transporting
has been released.

299
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:09,915
But we do have
every reason to believe

300
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:12,406
that there is an attack planned
in the near future.

301
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:14,212
What type of virus
are we talking about?

302
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,955
A weaponized strain
of hemorrhagic fever...

303
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:19,336
Basically causes you to
start bleeding and never stop.

304
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,222
And that's how
the virus spreads,

305
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,254
through contact
with bodily fluids.

306
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,979
It has an extremely short
incubation period

307
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:27,495
and a gruesome pathology.

308
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:31,018
If not treated quickly,
it has a 90% fatality rate.

309
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:32,464
And if
it's treated quickly?

310
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,598
We believe that drops down
to around 60%.

311
00:12:34,747 --> 00:12:36,414
But the bad news is...

312
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:37,526
That's not the bad news?

313
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:39,044
- No.
- The bad news is,

314
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:41,294
there's only
an experimental vaccine.

315
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:42,708
We're flying it here
from Atlanta.

316
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,646
But there's only
a few hundred doses.

317
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,513
Nowhere near enough
to combat an outbreak.

318
00:12:46,638 --> 00:12:50,254
So, obviously, the
rookie exam will be postponed.

319
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:52,808
The Feds are asking us to be
their boots on the ground

320
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:54,792
while they set up
a command center here.

321
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,464
First order of business...

322
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,294
To I.D. Corey's
partner/killer.

323
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,457
So you'll conduct
field interviews

324
00:13:01,545 --> 00:13:03,124
with the other passengers
on the bus.

325
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:05,404
Do we think Corey's killer
is operating alone now?

326
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:07,404
No. We think
there's one more...

327
00:13:07,492 --> 00:13:09,402
A local who picked him up
at the bus station.

328
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,544
So, okay, this is
extremely sensitive.

329
00:13:11,693 --> 00:13:13,763
We can't risk the news
getting out

330
00:13:13,873 --> 00:13:15,464
and causing a panic.

331
00:13:15,693 --> 00:13:16,914
That being said,

332
00:13:17,123 --> 00:13:18,794
you can warn
your immediate families

333
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,482
to stay away
from populated areas,

334
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:21,753
but no details.

335
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:22,914
Understood?

336
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:24,826
All right.
Let's go get these guys.

337
00:13:29,505 --> 00:13:31,472
Mom, it's only for
you and Dad, okay?

338
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,317
- You can't tell anybody else.
- No, I re... I really

339
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:34,490
can't
say anything else.

340
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,248
- <i>Now, the majority of...</i>
- You knew.

341
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:40,874
Can you give us a minute,
please?

342
00:13:40,995 --> 00:13:42,597
- Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you.

343
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:45,074
That's why you hesitated when
I talked about Henry visiting.

344
00:13:45,472 --> 00:13:47,204
You knew L.A.
wasn't safe.

345
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,199
I was briefed about
a possible threat last week.

346
00:13:51,355 --> 00:13:52,785
And you didn't warn me.

347
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:55,073
You'd just have Henry show up
for the apocalypse.

348
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,914
No, no. I-I didn't know
that this was real.

349
00:13:58,152 --> 00:14:00,414
The DHS and the FBI
hear dozens

350
00:14:00,501 --> 00:14:02,269
of potential terror threats
every month.

351
00:14:02,357 --> 00:14:04,738
And most of them are just talk
or we can shut them down.

352
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:07,456
That's not the same
as knowing it's safe.

353
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:09,754
This is my son
we're talking about.

354
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:12,532
Even if there was the slightest
chance there was danger,

355
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,540
you should've said
something.

356
00:14:13,628 --> 00:14:14,657
You ready?

357
00:14:14,745 --> 00:14:15,751
Yeah.

358
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:24,683
Honey, you should go
to your parents'.

359
00:14:24,923 --> 00:14:27,886
Look, you know I can't tell you
what's going on.

360
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:29,917
But it's bad.

361
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,941
You gonna call Wesley?

362
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:37,816
I want to.

363
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:40,205
But I don't know if I can
trust him to keep it quiet.

364
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:41,414
Really?

365
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,353
Yeah, this is the kind of
civil liberties issue

366
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:45,084
he gets on
his soapbox about.

367
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,268
Yeah, but how would you feel
if something happens

368
00:14:47,355 --> 00:14:49,144
and you didn't warn him?

369
00:14:55,619 --> 00:14:57,209
Hey, it's me.

370
00:14:58,535 --> 00:15:00,754
I'm afraid I can't get together
this afternoon.

371
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:02,261
Something came up.

372
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:05,918
Yeah,
I'm disappointed, too.

373
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:11,402
Uh, I'll call you later.

374
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,238
I couldn't risk it.

375
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:23,084
<i>Cut. That's lunch.</i>

376
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:25,058
<i>Everyone back
in 30 minutes, please.</i>

377
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,792
It's not right.

378
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:31,337
Keeping everyone
in the dark.

379
00:15:31,425 --> 00:15:32,440
We're supposed to be
protecting them.

380
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:33,517
That's what
we're trying to do.

381
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:34,334
Yeah, but...

382
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:35,794
But nothing,
Officer Nolan.

383
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:37,628
This is where
the job's hardest.

384
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,544
If we alert the public,
we alert the men we're hunting.

385
00:15:40,631 --> 00:15:42,886
Odds are, they'll panic
and set it all off.

386
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:45,334
And then we'll cause exactly
what we're trying to prevent.

387
00:15:45,421 --> 00:15:47,604
And what if they set it off
anyway before we catch them?

388
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:49,167
Then it'll haunt us.

389
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:51,924
All right,
what's this guy's name?

390
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:54,824
Really?

391
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,738
Um, Brad Dallas?

392
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,964
Oh, hey.
That's me.

393
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:01,584
Can we have a word with you
over here?

394
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:04,519
Uh, sure.
Uh, be right back.

395
00:16:06,251 --> 00:16:08,316
Were you on the bus last night
coming from Phoenix?

396
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:10,361
Uh, yeah.
I was visiting my mom. Why?

397
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:11,834
Did you see this man
on the bus?

398
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:13,004
Oh, that's cool.

399
00:16:13,091 --> 00:16:14,254
Is that a yes?

400
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:16,414
Uh, yeah,
he looks familiar.

401
00:16:16,501 --> 00:16:18,629
He was traveling with someone.
You happen to remember him?

402
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:19,999
No, I wasn't
paying attention.

403
00:16:20,148 --> 00:16:21,388
I was taking
a bunch of selfies.

404
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:23,097
You know,
for the 'gram?

405
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,369
But I couldn't post them,
though,

406
00:16:24,456 --> 00:16:25,345
'cause my pores were huge.

407
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:26,374
Can we see them,
please?

408
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:27,468
The pictures,
not your pores.

409
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:28,844
Oh.

410
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:35,402
Yep,
that's our dead guy.

411
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,423
Yeah, which means the man
next to him's our target,

412
00:16:39,511 --> 00:16:40,785
but he's too dark
to see.

413
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:42,432
You know who's really good
at Photoshop?

414
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,164
The FBI.
That's right.

415
00:16:44,251 --> 00:16:45,504
We're gonna take your phone,
but we'll get it back to you

416
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:46,624
just as soon as we can.

417
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:48,204
W-- Uh... Um...

418
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,834
Stay dry.

419
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:53,199
Man.

420
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,704
And here I thought
that test was gonna be

421
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,754
the most stressful thing
about my day.

422
00:16:56,841 --> 00:16:58,414
Best case scenario,
it's tomorrow's problem.

423
00:16:58,501 --> 00:16:59,745
And worst case?

424
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:01,334
Never mind...
Don't answer that.

425
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,551
Police.

426
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,794
Took you long enough.

427
00:17:07,964 --> 00:17:09,433
Bag's in here.

428
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:11,839
Sir, we're here about the bus
you took from Phoenix.

429
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:14,210
No kidding.
I called you about the bag.

430
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:15,624
And what bag is that?

431
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,384
I thought it was mine
on the bus.

432
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:19,124
I picked it up
by accident.

433
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:22,464
Noticed as soon as I got home.
Called right away.

434
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:25,254
Still took you guys like
six hours to get here.

435
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:27,003
Uh, sir, we're not here
about a bag.

436
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:28,501
So you don't have mine?

437
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,834
No.

438
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:32,044
Damn it.
My computer's in there.

439
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:33,964
I went through this one
looking for an address,

440
00:17:34,051 --> 00:17:37,339
and all I found was
some weird science equipment.

441
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:41,704
Control,
this is 7-Adam-19.

442
00:17:41,792 --> 00:17:43,191
Patch me into task force,
please.

443
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,732
Sir, did you...
touch anything in there?

444
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:49,087
Yeah, I cut my finger
going through it

445
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:50,664
looking for an address.

446
00:17:50,831 --> 00:17:52,254
Some kind
of broken vial.

447
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:53,914
Won't stop bleeding.

448
00:17:54,001 --> 00:17:55,084
Everything okay
in there?

449
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:57,160
Yeah.
Just stay out there.

450
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,780
Tim. No!

451
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,462
What's happening?
It's okay.

452
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,164
There's a bad case of the flu
going around.

453
00:18:16,251 --> 00:18:18,304
We were warned about it
this morning at roll call.

454
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:19,603
Nothing to panic about.

455
00:18:19,742 --> 00:18:21,115
Then why'd
you lock the door?

456
00:18:21,603 --> 00:18:23,165
Standard protocol.

457
00:18:23,551 --> 00:18:24,923
Look,
was there anyone else

458
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:27,584
in the house with you
earlier today?

459
00:18:27,712 --> 00:18:29,595
No.
My kid's with my ex.

460
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:31,241
You got
any cold medicine?

461
00:18:31,329 --> 00:18:32,584
I think so.

462
00:18:32,751 --> 00:18:34,765
Go take it.
I'm coughing up blood.

463
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:35,903
I'm just telling you
how they advised us

464
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,673
to treat this
if we came across it.

465
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:39,681
Right now,

466
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:42,262
my partner is radioing
for an ambulance.

467
00:18:42,818 --> 00:18:44,532
Gonna be here any minute.

468
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:47,751
Go.

469
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:51,964
Everything all right
out there, Chen?

470
00:18:52,181 --> 00:18:54,504
Uh, yeah.
The CDC's on their way.

471
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,079
Hey, you need
to come out of there.

472
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,873
That's not gonna happen.
Got to keep this contained.

473
00:18:58,961 --> 00:19:01,414
Tim... It's gonna
be all right, Boot.

474
00:19:01,626 --> 00:19:04,464
You keep your head
in the game, okay?

475
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:07,150
Everything's
gonna be fine.

476
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:13,051
Where are
those pictures?

477
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:17,325
Okay, FBI table.

478
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:19,841
John, uh, wait.

479
00:19:23,881 --> 00:19:25,442
I'm sorry.

480
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:28,526
I would have never let you
bring your son

481
00:19:28,614 --> 00:19:30,664
into a dangerous situation.

482
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:32,895
I promise.

483
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,473
Good.

484
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,286
'Cause I really didn't like
being mad at you.

485
00:19:38,921 --> 00:19:41,334
I didn't really like you
being mad at me, either.

486
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,825
Jessica.

487
00:19:49,671 --> 00:19:52,229
Our terrorist is Jimmy Roskin,
31 years old.

488
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,294
Arrested eight months ago

489
00:19:53,382 --> 00:19:54,754
on a hate crime charge
that didn't stick.

490
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:56,199
Okay, run his photo
against all the traffic

491
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:57,652
and security cameras
around the bus station.

492
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:59,559
And check
for known associates.

493
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:01,315
Looks like we have
our first infection.

494
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:02,552
Who?

495
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,450
One of the bus passengers.
Luckily, he's contained.

496
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:07,551
But Tim might be
infected, too.

497
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,630
Come on.
Let's move it on out.

498
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,543
Officer Chen, you
want to tell me what happened?

499
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,124
Yeah, uh, the bus passenger
mistakenly grabbed

500
00:20:31,211 --> 00:20:32,738
the wrong bag, and the virus
must have been in it

501
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:34,575
because he coughed up blood
on Tim.

502
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:36,376
What... Whoa.
What are they doing?

503
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:37,747
We need to
get them out of there.

504
00:20:37,835 --> 00:20:39,254
We will. But first
we have to establish

505
00:20:39,341 --> 00:20:40,374
a proper quarantine.

506
00:20:40,461 --> 00:20:41,664
Did any blood
get on you?

507
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:43,874
Uh, no.
I was out here.

508
00:20:43,961 --> 00:20:45,414
Tim immediately
closed the door.

509
00:20:45,586 --> 00:20:46,876
Smart man.

510
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,370
Officer Bradford, this is
Dr. Morgan from the CDC.

511
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,184
Hey, Doc.
How you doing?

512
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:55,700
Fine. But Mr. Langston's
struggling a little.

513
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,294
Can you describe
his condition?

514
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,458
Yeah. He, uh,
started coughing blood

515
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,964
about 20 minutes ago.

516
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:03,544
Now he's got
a pretty wicked nosebleed.

517
00:21:03,631 --> 00:21:07,112
Why aren't they coming in?
Where's my ambulance?

518
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,124
It'll be here any minute.
Just... stay put.

519
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:11,229
Save your energy.

520
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:13,044
Uh, where's the vaccine?

521
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:15,382
Still in the air. Should land
in the next hour or so.

522
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,203
You can't
make Tim wait in there.

523
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,690
He might not be infected.
Sorry.

524
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,231
Quarantine rules exist
for a reason.

525
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:22,588
Officer Bradford,

526
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:24,556
do you mind if I put you
to work while you wait?

527
00:21:25,432 --> 00:21:26,790
You want to know
what's in the bag?

528
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:27,875
Yes, I do.

529
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:29,143
Copy that.

530
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:32,854
Uh, Chen, I'm gonna
turn on my body cam.

531
00:21:32,942 --> 00:21:34,305
You can monitor it
from out there.

532
00:21:34,446 --> 00:21:36,659
Okay.
Please be careful.

533
00:21:40,381 --> 00:21:41,914
All right.

534
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:43,502
Here we go.

535
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,153
Wait, wait.
What is that bottle?

536
00:22:00,582 --> 00:22:02,504
Looks like
the delivery device.

537
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,914
It's a misting fan.
I think you're right.

538
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:07,075
Looks like there's a growth
medium inside the bottle.

539
00:22:07,162 --> 00:22:08,950
Add the virus to it,
then spray it in a crowd.

540
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:10,530
Droplets land
on people's faces,

541
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:12,413
infect them through
their mouth and nose.

542
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,414
It's as low tech
as you can get.

543
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,793
It's Dr. Morgan.

544
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,887
I know how they're planning
to disperse the virus.

545
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,801
Understood.

546
00:22:19,896 --> 00:22:21,469
Yes.

547
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:23,664
Okay, keep...
Keep me posted.

548
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,044
How's Tim?

549
00:22:25,131 --> 00:22:27,223
- It's too soon to tell.
- Got something!

550
00:22:29,684 --> 00:22:32,004
Photo of our guy matched back
to a gas station

551
00:22:32,091 --> 00:22:33,414
where the bus depot is.

552
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:34,971
We got a picture
of the car

553
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:36,334
that picked him up
but not the driver.

554
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:37,584
I ran the plate,
but it came back stolen.

555
00:22:37,671 --> 00:22:39,338
Okay,
cut to the good news.

556
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,683
I followed it
through traffic cameras

557
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,818
all the way
to Highland Park.

558
00:22:41,905 --> 00:22:43,526
But I lost it when it got off
the freeway.

559
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,315
That area's mostly residential,
except for the police museum...

560
00:22:46,403 --> 00:22:47,630
But I doubt that's where
they were headed.

561
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:49,051
More than likely,
that's where home base is.

562
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:51,341
Or they went local
to avoid highway cams.

563
00:22:51,429 --> 00:22:52,916
Either way,
it's the only lead we got.

564
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:53,817
Get out there.

565
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:55,797
I'm sending all available units
to canvass with you.

566
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:57,035
Yes, sir.

567
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:04,449
No sign of any I.D.
or target information.

568
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:09,035
Tim!
Tim, look out!

569
00:23:14,881 --> 00:23:17,504
Tim?

570
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:19,914
Tim!

571
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:22,004
I gotta get outta here.

572
00:23:22,091 --> 00:23:23,710
Gotta get
outta here here.

573
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:26,380
Gotta get outta here.

574
00:23:30,341 --> 00:23:32,001
Tim!

575
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,624
Tim, are you okay?

576
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:46,294
Hey, answer me.

577
00:23:46,381 --> 00:23:48,550
It's okay! I'm okay!

578
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:52,103
Well, that was fun.

579
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:53,699
Are you sure
you're okay?

580
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,653
Kind of depends on your
definition of the word.

581
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,488
You need to get that vaccine
here right now.

582
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:04,588
<i>All units, be advised

Well, if you do see him,
or the car, please call 911.

596
00:24:34,218 --> 00:24:35,797
Right.

597
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:39,164
Nobody knows each other
in this neighborhood.

598
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:41,051
Back in Pennsylvania,
I knew all my neighbors.

599
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:43,334
Names, families, even helped
deliver a few kids.

600
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:44,692
I'm sorry, what?

601
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,783
Robertson twins,
winter storm of 2014.

602
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:49,503
Hospital roads
were all blocked,

603
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:51,276
so I had to become
a temporary midwife.

604
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,387
Good thing I brought
my toolbox,

605
00:24:52,474 --> 00:24:54,074
- too, 'cause... right.
- Forget I asked.

606
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:58,044
Let's go talk to
some real locals.

607
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:02,504
Well, that was a bust.

608
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:04,124
Yeah, most people
are at work.

609
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,050
Hey.
What's going on?

610
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:09,169
Awful lot of cops around.

611
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,164
I'm not really
at liberty to say.

612
00:25:11,251 --> 00:25:13,393
Seriously?
This is my neighborhood.

613
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:15,520
If something's going on,
I deserve to know.

614
00:25:17,051 --> 00:25:18,606
Okay. But.

615
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:22,075
You have to keep it quiet.
You can't tell anyone else.

616
00:25:22,163 --> 00:25:23,372
Sure.

617
00:25:23,591 --> 00:25:25,059
We're trying to stop
a terror attack.

618
00:25:25,147 --> 00:25:26,943
We believe one of the terrorists
lives around here.

619
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,004
So you should evacuate...
Maybe even get out of the city.

620
00:25:29,091 --> 00:25:31,099
Okay?
No, not okay.

621
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:32,888
So far from okay.

622
00:25:32,976 --> 00:25:35,165
Why haven't you issued a warning
or an evacuation?

623
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:37,254
- People have the right to know.
- We can't, okay?

624
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:39,124
'Cause it would cause a panic
and alert the terrorists

625
00:25:39,211 --> 00:25:40,918
- that we're onto them.
- That's not your call to make.

626
00:25:41,005 --> 00:25:42,316
This is why I didn't tell you
in the first place.

627
00:25:42,403 --> 00:25:43,816
Because I knew you were gonna
get on your high horse...

628
00:25:43,903 --> 00:25:47,414
High horse? This is about
basic civil liberties, guys.

629
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:48,794
Give me your phone.

630
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,130
What?

631
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:51,873
I'm placing you
under arrest.

632
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:53,114
Wait. What for?

633
00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:56,005
Violation of public order.
Come on.

634
00:25:56,247 --> 00:25:57,527
This isn't gonna hold up in court.

635
00:25:57,614 --> 00:25:58,964
Doesn't have to.

636
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:01,366
But you're incommunicado
until this is resolved.

637
00:26:01,454 --> 00:26:02,787
Come on.

638
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:07,317
You sure about this?

639
00:26:07,405 --> 00:26:08,695
No.

640
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:12,456
Do you recognize
this man?

641
00:26:12,677 --> 00:26:14,021
Or this car?

642
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:15,543
Yeah, the car, yeah.

643
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:17,124
I see it almost
every morning on Fig.

644
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,693
That's where I panhandle.

645
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:21,762
The, uh, driver is
a real piece of crap.

646
00:26:21,912 --> 00:26:24,115
Cursed me out,
saying I ruined his country.

647
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:26,664
Like I wasn't born
at Cedars-Sinai, you know?

648
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:28,504
Officer Bishop.

649
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:29,810
Thank you.

650
00:26:29,983 --> 00:26:31,202
This gentleman
has seen the car.

651
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,464
I don't suppose you know
where the guy lives?

652
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:33,874
Over off Wayland.

653
00:26:33,961 --> 00:26:35,504
Yeah, I, uh,
keyed his car once

654
00:26:35,591 --> 00:26:37,464
while I was out collecting cans
on trash day.

655
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:39,858
It's a yellow
apartment building.

656
00:26:40,008 --> 00:26:41,186
Can't miss it.

657
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:48,754
You sure we shouldn't wait
for a Hazmat team?

658
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,624
There's no time. They might
already be on the way

659
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:51,754
to their target.

660
00:26:56,051 --> 00:26:57,051
Clear!

661
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,704
Our unknown terrorist
is Brendan Mitchell.

662
00:27:01,841 --> 00:27:03,197
Control,
alert task force.

663
00:27:03,285 --> 00:27:05,328
We have a positive I.D.
on our second suspect.

664
00:27:06,243 --> 00:27:08,658
Help!

665
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:10,556
Help!

666
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:38,914
Bishop?

667
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:40,853
We know where
they're headed.

668
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:48,961
Feds are pulling resources
from all over the Southland.

669
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:52,043
<i>All major roads heading to LAX
are being monitored.</i>

670
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:54,004
<i>So while the airport
is shut down,</i>

671
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:56,710
<i>we'll provide support
at assigned checkpoints</i>

672
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,334
<i>on Century
and Sepulveda Boulevards.</i>

673
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:01,460
7-Adam-07, copy.

674
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:03,254
En route
to Sepulveda checkpoint.

675
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:05,294
You're seriously gonna keep me
in this car all night?

676
00:28:05,381 --> 00:28:08,084
You're the one that wanted to
spend more quality time together.

677
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:10,754
Sir, this operation's
moving at a million miles an hour.

678
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:12,414
And these checkpoints were
determined by someone

679
00:28:12,501 --> 00:28:14,050
who has definitely
not tried to make

680
00:28:14,138 --> 00:28:15,693
a last-minute flight
at LAX.

681
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:17,294
We're not running point
on this.

682
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,214
<i>We all have orders
to follow.</i>

683
00:28:19,302 --> 00:28:20,294
Including me.

684
00:28:20,381 --> 00:28:22,824
Yes, sir. But there is
a hole in the perimeter

685
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:24,374
that only an L.A. native

686
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:27,292
or a rookie patrol officer
who's painstakingly studied

687
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,943
every street in this city
would know.

688
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:31,003
He's right. There are
back roads off La Cienega.

689
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:32,074
Our guy would know that.

690
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:34,396
Sir, even with the airport
shut down,

691
00:28:34,498 --> 00:28:36,307
there'll be thousands
of people waiting there.

692
00:28:36,395 --> 00:28:37,912
If these two guys
get through...

693
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:41,107
All right, let's do it.

694
00:28:41,195 --> 00:28:43,398
Control, this is 7-L-20.

695
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:45,670
<i>Show us diverting
to La Cienega,</i>

696
00:28:45,921 --> 00:28:47,794
<i>and reroute an airship
over there.</i>

697
00:28:48,006 --> 00:28:50,013
Eyes out
for our blue sedan.

698
00:28:57,291 --> 00:29:00,216
Hey, I, uh... I just checked
with Dr. Morgan.

699
00:29:00,326 --> 00:29:02,164
The vaccine's
minutes away.

700
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,914
You know, you're good at
a lot of things...

701
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,464
Lying isn't one of them.

702
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:11,568
You think I'm good at things?
Can I get that in writing?

703
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:15,724
How are you doing?

704
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,974
Are there
any symptoms yet?

705
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,414
I'm sweating like a pig.

706
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:24,699
But it's probably because

707
00:29:24,787 --> 00:29:26,615
it's 100 degrees
in this room.

708
00:29:29,568 --> 00:29:31,504
It's gonna be okay.

709
00:29:31,826 --> 00:29:33,365
I really believe that.

710
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:38,115
I'm sure you do.

711
00:29:40,521 --> 00:29:41,914
But if it isn't...

712
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,480
Don't think like that.
It's...

713
00:29:44,568 --> 00:29:47,792
If it isn't...
I'm not going out

714
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,170
the way my man Pete here
just did.

715
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,709
What are you saying?

716
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,841
When the time comes...

717
00:29:58,341 --> 00:30:00,240
...I'm going out
on my own terms.

718
00:30:11,091 --> 00:30:14,058
Be advised. Suspect
vehicle spotted on Centinela,

719
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,414

722
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:23,154
Up ahead. Blue sedan.
That's him.

723
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:29,755
Control, 7-Adam-15...
We are in pursuit of suspect.

724
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,473

Jimmy!
Jimmy, run! Run!

749
00:32:13,421 --> 00:32:14,707
They're running!

750
00:32:18,751 --> 00:32:20,519
- Ready?
- Yeah, let's go.

751
00:32:29,628 --> 00:32:31,464
Control, 7-L-20.

752
00:32:31,636 --> 00:32:33,124
Suspects are on foot
heading east.

753
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:34,914
We need a five-block perimeter
set up.

754
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:36,544
And send Hazmat units

755
00:32:36,632 --> 00:32:38,842
to lock down this area
for containment.

756
00:32:40,211 --> 00:32:41,527
This way!

757
00:32:49,421 --> 00:32:50,584
- Nobody move!
- Hey, hey, hey!

758
00:32:50,671 --> 00:32:52,380
Everybody down! Get down!

759
00:33:04,841 --> 00:33:06,341
He's on the bus
with the virus!

760
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:09,128
Angela,
it's too dangerous.

761
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:11,009
We have to.

762
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:15,947
Ready?

763
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:23,000
Everybody down!

764
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:25,504
All I need is a shot.

765
00:33:25,591 --> 00:33:27,374
I'll get you that.

766
00:33:27,613 --> 00:33:29,124
Down!

767
00:33:29,328 --> 00:33:30,368
Nobody move.

768
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:37,464
Get outta here.
Go, go.

769
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:44,914
Dude,
let's talk about this.

770
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:47,164
Hey! Hey!
Don't do that.

771
00:33:47,251 --> 00:33:48,874
You don't
need to do that.

772
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:52,164
Let me go, or I'm gonna infect
everybody on this bus!

773
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:54,593
If I let you go, you'll infect
a hell of a lot more people.

774
00:33:54,773 --> 00:33:57,685
Yeah. None of them
are gonna be you!

775
00:33:57,773 --> 00:33:59,004
Damn.

776
00:33:59,091 --> 00:34:00,964
That's some straight shooting
right there.

777
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:03,414
Appealing to my sense
of self-preservation.

778
00:34:04,191 --> 00:34:06,542
But here's the thing...

779
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,355
I made my peace with dying
when I got on this bus.

780
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:12,706
So I'm coming over there...

781
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:15,591
...and I'm arresting you.

782
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:20,090
Aah!

783
00:34:25,551 --> 00:34:27,671
Clear! Go, go! Off now! Off the bus!
Go, go, go, go!

784
00:34:33,091 --> 00:34:34,504
Did you shoot me?

785
00:34:34,747 --> 00:34:37,204
Just a little.

786
00:34:37,291 --> 00:34:38,825
I guess you're screwed.

787
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,543
Rules clearly say that
if you shoot your rookie,

788
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:44,200
then you can't hand him off
to another T.O.

789
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:49,254
7-Adam-07, show Code 4
at our location... suspect down.

790
00:34:54,153 --> 00:34:56,911
Heading east on Crescent in
search of armed terror suspect.

791
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:00,926
Ma'am,
get back inside.

792
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,028
<i>7-Adam-15,
crossing Wilton on Higsby.</i>

793
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:15,364
No sign of suspect.

794
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:28,333
Control,
possible contact,

795
00:35:28,598 --> 00:35:30,411
5824 Elgin.

796
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:32,215
We're gonna check
the backyard.

797
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:01,051
Yeah,
this is Jessica Russo.

798
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,701
Call the FAA and tell them that
we're gonna fly some choppers

799
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:06,979
into LAX airspace and then
have them reroute an airship

800
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,958
to our location ASAP.

801
00:36:33,473 --> 00:36:34,506
Think we got him?

802
00:36:34,594 --> 00:36:36,473
Assume we didn't.

803
00:36:38,051 --> 00:36:39,754
Hey, there.

804
00:36:40,012 --> 00:36:41,414
You hear those sirens?

805
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:42,834
That's just about
a couple hundred

806
00:36:42,921 --> 00:36:44,604
of my closest friends
coming to back me up.

807
00:36:44,692 --> 00:36:46,651
But you're all alone.

808
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:50,124
Okay.

809
00:36:50,211 --> 00:36:51,834
Your turn.

810
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:53,629
Hey, Jimmy!

811
00:36:53,717 --> 00:36:55,848
We got your buddy
in custody.

812
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:57,207
It's over.

813
00:36:58,872 --> 00:37:00,833
I know you're hurt.

814
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:02,848
But you're still alive.

815
00:37:03,413 --> 00:37:06,246
And I'm offering a way
for you to stay alive.

816
00:37:06,973 --> 00:37:09,559
Think of all the publicity
you'll get.

817
00:37:09,676 --> 00:37:12,254
You'll be the face
of your cause.

818
00:37:12,426 --> 00:37:14,434
So much better
than being a martyr

819
00:37:14,522 --> 00:37:16,419
in a cold box
underground.

820
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,093
But, Jimmy,
you got to decide right now.

821
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:24,786
When S.W.A.T. gets here,
they're just gonna light you up.

822
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:30,164
Okay. Okay.
I-I-I'm coming out.

823
00:37:30,251 --> 00:37:31,841
Don't shoot.

824
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,504
Show me those hands.

825
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:39,893
What the hell?

826
00:37:39,981 --> 00:37:41,254
He was reaching.

827
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:42,837
I didn't see that.

828
00:37:44,921 --> 00:37:46,294
Stay back.

829
00:37:46,496 --> 00:37:47,879
He might still be alive.

830
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:50,668
He might be infected. So we
don't go anywhere near him.

831
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:54,176
Suspect is down.

832
00:37:54,264 --> 00:37:56,677
I repeat,
suspect is down.

833
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,543
Yeah, area's quarantined
until CDC clears it.

834
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:07,309
Please tell me
that's the vaccine.

835
00:38:07,461 --> 00:38:08,879
It is.

836
00:38:09,184 --> 00:38:10,533
Wait. Stand back.

837
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,496
You're not wearing
protective gear.

838
00:38:13,137 --> 00:38:14,291
Yeah.

839
00:38:15,379 --> 00:38:18,082
Officer Bradford,
it's time to let me in.

840
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,114
Hey.
Hey, Doc.

841
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:22,202
We got it.

842
00:38:23,591 --> 00:38:24,964
How are you feeling?

843
00:38:25,051 --> 00:38:27,221
Not bad...
All things considered.

844
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:28,964
Good.
You're right at the edge

845
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:30,624
of what we think is
the incubation window.

846
00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:34,254
So the fact that you're not
showing any symptoms doesn't suck.

847
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:36,816
But we're gonna give you
this vaccine just to make sure.

848
00:38:36,903 --> 00:38:38,637
It's experimental,
right?

849
00:38:38,739 --> 00:38:40,414
That's correct.

850
00:38:40,501 --> 00:38:43,119
So we're just gonna have
to wait and see what happens.

851
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:44,414
Maybe nothing.

852
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:46,395
Maybe you grow horns.

853
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:48,374
But for now,

854
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:50,841
I'd say you might've
dodged a bullet.

855
00:38:56,004 --> 00:38:57,791
Any chance we can kiss
and make up?

856
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:59,294
Or can I expect
a lawsuit?

857
00:38:59,381 --> 00:39:01,356
Oh, up
until about 20 minutes ago,

858
00:39:01,444 --> 00:39:03,016
I was drafting it
in my head.

859
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,651
But then you risked everything,
got on that bus,

860
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:06,704
and saved those people.

861
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,213
You got a little
turned on.

862
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:09,414
No.

863
00:39:09,501 --> 00:39:12,504
Okay, yeah,
maybe a little.

864
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:15,834
It made me realize that I was
a little shortsighted earlier.

865
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:17,964
Maybe I didn't
actually know best

866
00:39:18,051 --> 00:39:20,051
what should happen
in that situation.

867
00:39:20,364 --> 00:39:21,874
So, we're good again?

868
00:39:22,754 --> 00:39:24,223
Again.

869
00:39:24,421 --> 00:39:26,356
Does it seem like
we fight a lot?

870
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:28,227
Definitely. But...

871
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,988
I think it's our thing,
you know?

872
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,409
Like some couples swing dance
or go to Disneyland.

873
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:36,278
And I didn't want to r...

874
00:39:36,381 --> 00:39:37,847
Jackson!

875
00:39:38,081 --> 00:39:39,456
Dad.

876
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:41,414
Heard what you did.

877
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:42,761
What can I say?

878
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:45,285
I'm my father's son.

879
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:59,706
- Good job.
- What?

880
00:40:00,122 --> 00:40:03,075
Oh, um, thank you.
It was all Jessica.

881
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:06,293
Don't sell yourself short.
You sure you're okay?

882
00:40:07,182 --> 00:40:08,240
No.

883
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:13,285
I don't think he was reaching
for a weapon.

884
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,767
What are you saying?

885
00:40:14,855 --> 00:40:16,704
I'm saying
she lied to me.

886
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:18,834
The guy had
a biological weapon.

887
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:20,603
He was giving up.
Maybe he was,

888
00:40:20,691 --> 00:40:22,174
or maybe that's what
he wanted you to think.

889
00:40:22,261 --> 00:40:23,829
Either way,
his very existence

890
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:25,584
made him a clear
and present danger.

891
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:27,204
She's got 20 years
on the job,

892
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,129
dealing with a whole different
level of bad guy...

893
00:40:29,216 --> 00:40:31,269
And I don't know anything
because I'm a rookie?

894
00:40:31,711 --> 00:40:33,704
Look, I'm no Boy Scout,
all right?

895
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,604
If six months on this job
has taught me anything,

896
00:40:35,691 --> 00:40:37,400
it's that there is evil
in this world.

897
00:40:37,488 --> 00:40:39,584
But in that moment,

898
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:41,189
she chose to lie to me.

899
00:40:41,277 --> 00:40:42,874
Just like she lied to me
about Henry.

900
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:45,464
So either
she doesn't trust me.

901
00:40:46,198 --> 00:40:47,667
Or she's a liar.

902
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:49,964
Or she was doing you
a favor.

903
00:40:50,104 --> 00:40:53,213
Giving you deniability if the
shooting ever became a thing.

904
00:40:55,131 --> 00:40:57,118
So you're saying
I should just let it go?

905
00:40:57,206 --> 00:40:59,010
I'm saying it's been
a crazy day.

906
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:01,351
And you don't know whether
you're coming or going.

907
00:41:01,591 --> 00:41:03,282
So before you risk
your relationship...

908
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,874
And possibly
your career...

909
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:07,120
By blindly
charging forward,

910
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:09,671
maybe you should
sleep on it.

911
00:41:34,591 --> 00:41:37,344
Hey. I heard you guys
saved the day.

912
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:39,479
It was a group effort.

913
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,833
- Glad you're okay.
- Me too.

914
00:41:41,921 --> 00:41:43,821
I-I mean
that you're okay, too.

915
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:45,094
How's Tim?

916
00:41:45,182 --> 00:41:46,461
I think he's gonna be
all right.

917
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:49,071
- That's good news.
- What now?

918
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:51,643
24-hour observation
at the CDC.

919
00:41:52,924 --> 00:41:54,891
I'll bet my pension
he just told doctors

920
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,284
Tim Bradford does not ride
in a wheelchair.

921
00:41:57,419 --> 00:42:00,104
Only way I'm leavin'
out of here is on my own two feet.

922
00:42:00,557 --> 00:42:02,504
Don't you guys have
paperwork to finish?

923
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:04,792
He's back.

924
00:42:05,114 --> 00:42:07,042
<i>- Yeah, he is.
- So stubborn.</i>

925
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:09,784
♪ Who knows me like you do ♪

926
00:42:14,549 --> 00:42:15,870
Officer Bradford!

927
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,211
- Tim!
- Officer Bradford!

928
00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:19,556
We need an ambulance! Tim,
what happened in the perimeter?

929
00:42:19,643 --> 00:42:20,972
<i>- What's wrong?
- Everyone, stay back.</i>

930

<i>- Tim!
