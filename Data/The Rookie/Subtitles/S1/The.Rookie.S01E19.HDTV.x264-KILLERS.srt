00:00:00,742 --> 00:00:01,852
<i>7-Adam-15,</i>

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:04,434
<i>silent alarm, 801 North Heatherly.</i>

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,173
<i>Respond Code 2-High.</i>

4
00:00:10,339 --> 00:00:11,804
We got an I.D. on the homeowner?

5
00:00:11,906 --> 00:00:14,109
Nope. Listed to a holding company.

6
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:20,833
Police!

7
00:00:29,652 --> 00:00:30,853
Bishop?

8
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:40,884
Hey! Hi.

9
00:00:40,953 --> 00:00:42,587
Oh, thank God.

10
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:44,354
I've been stuck up here
for almost an hour.

11
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:46,884
Control, send LAFD to our location.

12
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:48,095
We got a guy in a tree.

13
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:49,611
I have so many questions,

14
00:00:49,645 --> 00:00:51,775
starting with "How?"
and ending with "Why?"

15
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:53,224
I missed the landing zone.

16
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:54,677
That's obvious.

17
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:56,722
Excuse me.

18
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,230
What are you guys doing on my property?

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,824
Do you guys have a warrant?

20
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:01,470
We got a call.

21
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:02,636
Uh, silent alarm.

22
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:04,111
And what are you doing in my tree, bro?

23
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,282
He missed the landing zone.

24
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,580
Yeah, that's obvious.

25
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:09,251
Actually, I was aiming
for Selena Gomez's house.

26
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:11,087
Uh, Selena Gomez doesn't live here.

27
00:01:11,124 --> 00:01:13,095
She li... I-I can't tell you

28
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:14,002
- where Selena Gomez lives.
- Wait.

29
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,517
Are you stalking Selena?

30
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:17,197
Stalking's such an ugly word.

31
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:19,269
Parachuting into somebody's backyard

32
00:01:19,306 --> 00:01:20,807
is, like, kind of psycho, bro.

33
00:01:20,844 --> 00:01:22,644
You need to check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

34
00:01:22,703 --> 00:01:24,263
Does that mean you don't want
to press charges?

35
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:26,345
Nah. Just get him
off my property A.S.A.P.

36
00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:27,547
You got it.

37
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:32,447
Oh, my God, that's will.i.am!

38
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:34,009
That's so cool.

39
00:01:46,327 --> 00:01:47,959
Phew!

40
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:49,820
Oh, geez!

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,827
That's not creepy at all.

42
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:53,452
It arrived.

43
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:55,243
What did?

44
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,062
Oh, the Ferrari?

45
00:01:57,131 --> 00:01:58,748
V-12, single overhead cam,

46
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,753
0 to 60 before you can blink.

47
00:02:00,808 --> 00:02:02,328
Oh, I don't know, man.
I can blink pretty fast.

48
00:02:02,364 --> 00:02:03,491
Come with me to pick it up.

49
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:05,258
Oh, okay.

50
00:02:05,295 --> 00:02:06,354
Oh. Wait a second.

51
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:07,654
You just want to use my badge

52
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:09,225
so you can open it up on the freeway.

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,656
No! No!

54
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:12,000
Sorry, buddy. No dice.

55
00:02:12,037 --> 00:02:14,935
Besides, I got to get into work
early, check on Bishop.

56
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:17,106
She has her DRP tomorrow
for her PHQ violation.

57
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:18,439
- The what for the what?
- Oh.

58
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:20,443
Disciplinary Review Panel
for leaving her foster brother

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,960
off of her
Personal History Questionnaire

60
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:23,443
when she joined the department.

61
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:24,966
Guy had a criminal record.

62
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:26,156
Is that a big deal?

63
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:28,531
Well, she could be fired for
lying on an official document.

64
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:29,735
Oh, that's rough.

65
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:32,040
I can see why you're taking your
frustrations out on the bag.

66
00:02:32,077 --> 00:02:33,888
Well, 'cause Bishop says there's
nothing I can do to help her.

67
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:35,604
- That's your problem, you know.
- Oh, good.

68
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,441
I was hoping we could make this
about my inadequacies.

69
00:02:37,477 --> 00:02:38,484
No, I'm serious.

70
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:41,459
You have a pathological need
to fix things for people,

71
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,088
even when you know
there's nothing you can do.

72
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:44,412
No, I don't.

73
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:46,638
I... Okay, look,
I simply refuse to believe

74
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:48,260
that there's never not a solution.

75
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:50,173
That's, like, a triple negative.

76
00:02:50,232 --> 00:02:51,853
So, tell me, Mr. Fixit...

77
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,301
does Bishop even want your help?

78
00:02:53,336 --> 00:02:55,490
- Why wouldn't she?
- Because you're a rookie...

79
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:56,693
bottom of the food chain.

80
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,699
Nothing you think or say matters
inside the department.

81
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:01,123
Especially with the Chief of Police...

82
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,128
who personally decides
Talia's punishment.

83
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:04,904
Sounds a little harsh.

84
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:06,014
Harsh as it is,

85
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:07,935
you got to stay focused
on yourself right now.

86
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:09,633
We got a six-month exam
in the next week,

87
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,399
and we got to ace it
in order to move on

88
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:12,556
to the next stage of our training.

89
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,037
Where we'll still be
riding with our T.O.s

90
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:15,232
for, what, another seven months?

91
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:16,691
Yeah. But we'll get more freedom.

92
00:03:16,728 --> 00:03:18,306
And no more daily evaluations.

93
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:19,878
Otherwise, it's back
to the starting line,

94
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:21,916
and you're the rookie
who got held back.

95
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,182
Or worse.

96
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,659
What's with the glasses?

97
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:32,206
Uh, I realized I need to start
having more fun with the job,

98
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,491
stop taking everything so seriously.

99
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:37,256
All right, listen up.

100
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:39,163
Got some bad news for our rookies.

101
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,635
Thanks to Detective Jenkins
being placed on the Brady List,

102
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:43,740
the department is tightening the rules

103
00:03:43,777 --> 00:03:45,878
regarding the Field Training program.

104
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:47,113
Bottom line...

105
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,281
every recruit now has to complete

106
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,754
the "training and experience"
checklist as a primary officer

107
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,840
before they'll be allowed
to take the six-month exam.

108
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:57,077
You got to be kidding.

109
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:59,257
I don't let my rookies be
primary until the second month.

110
00:03:59,294 --> 00:04:00,774
If our recruits experience an event,

111
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,325
it shouldn't matter
if they were primary.

112
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:04,552
- It's not fair to them or us.
- I agree.

113
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:06,874
But this is "cover your ass"
time for the department.

114
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:09,396
When the city gets sued,
the first thing they look at

115
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,075
is the officer training and experience.

116
00:04:11,112 --> 00:04:13,492
They've decided
that experience can't just be

117
00:04:13,529 --> 00:04:14,832
"I was standing there, too."

118
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:17,054
We can't start this
with the <i>next</i> round of recruits?

119
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:19,622
The LAPD is a bureaucracy,
Officer Bishop.

120
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,474
The last thing they care about
is a bunch of rookies.

121
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,413
So, how do we know
how many cases we owe?

122
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:26,724
Putting your listening ears on,
Officer Chen,

123
00:04:26,761 --> 00:04:27,849
'cause I'm about to tell you.

124
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:29,079
To complete your checklist,

125
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:31,544
you still needed to be primary
on an auto theft,

126
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:34,784
carjacking, ethical dilemma,
meth possession,

127
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:37,556
a false I.D.,
assault on a peace officer,

128
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:39,198
and damage to city property.

129
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,740
- That's... like, seven things.
- What about us?

130
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:44,786
Officer West needs
a high-risk crowd control,

131
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:46,474
meth possession, and a carjacking.

132
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,091
Piece of cake, boss.

133
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,037
I mean "Sir."

134
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:51,779
I'm afraid to ask.

135
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,005
So, Officer Nolan,
the number of items you need

136
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,279
on your checklist are...

137
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,367
...zero.

138
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:01,029
You might want to thank
your training officer

139
00:05:01,066 --> 00:05:03,122
for making you primary
starting day one.

140
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:06,785
And, since we are
ripping off the Band-Aid,

141
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:08,545
here's the rest of the bad news.

142
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:11,021
HR needs proof of completion

143
00:05:11,058 --> 00:05:12,856
by end of shift tomorrow.

144
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:15,919
Otherwise, the recruits are
extended in the program.

145
00:05:15,956 --> 00:05:17,274
Meaning we fall behind.

146
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:19,240
Sir, there's no way we can
control what "experiences"

147
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,594
they'll get in the next two days.

148
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:21,764
Understood.

149
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:23,700
Look, I know this is a tall order.

150
00:05:23,894 --> 00:05:25,761
But I believe in you.

151
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,240
I've notified dispatch
of the calls that are needed.

152
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:30,013
They will funnel them
to your shops if...

153
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:32,813
<i>when... when they come in.</i>

154
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:34,544
That's it. All right?

155
00:05:34,581 --> 00:05:36,988
Good luck. Be safe out there.

156
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,284
Officer Nolan,
since you're free and clear,

157
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:40,732
go see Detective Wolfe.

158
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,293
He has a job for you and Bishop.

159
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,587
Yes, sir.

160
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,740
Heard you had a case for us.

161
00:05:46,825 --> 00:05:48,593
Yeah. Come in.

162
00:05:49,357 --> 00:05:51,050
I need your help with a fugitive.

163
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,492
Craig Lawson... skipped town last year

164
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,943
when he learned
he was gonna be arrested

165
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,411
for embezzling a couple million
from the family business.

166
00:05:58,448 --> 00:06:00,005
Then last week, Dad kicks the bucket.

167
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,669
You think Lawson will
come back for the funeral?

168
00:06:01,705 --> 00:06:03,936
Or the reception afterwards
back at the house.

169
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,357
I'll stake that out while you head

170
00:06:05,394 --> 00:06:06,736
to Malibu for the service.

171
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:07,939
I gave local law a heads-up.

172
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:09,060
Yes, sir.

173
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:10,279
Hey.

174
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,904
How's Bishop?

175
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:14,683
Oh, she's... okay.

176
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,361
Tell her I said the DRP is bull.

177
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,310
She risked her life to save mine.

178
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:20,614
There's no way she should get bounced

179
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:21,918
over an omit on her paperwork.

180
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,443
And I told the brass that.

181
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:24,889
I'll let her know.

182
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:26,823
I'm sure she'll appreciate that.

183
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,100
Do you think it would mean something,

184
00:06:31,136 --> 00:06:32,415
if spoke to the brass?

185
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:34,859
- You're a rookie.
- I'm a rookie. That's...

186
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:51,308
New shades?

187
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:52,482
I can hear your mockery.

188
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:54,232
Then I said it right. Take 'em off.

189
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:56,240
I'm pretty familiar
with the duty manual,

190
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:58,947
and nowhere does it say
that I can't wear these.

191
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:01,027
So if I'm not breaking any rules,

192
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:02,551
why you sweatin' me?

193
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:06,091
Take them off or eat them.

194
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:07,789
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:09,491
<i>7-Adam-07, assault and battery,</i>

196
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,283
<i>1501 Melrose.</i>

197
00:07:11,874 --> 00:07:13,234
Oh, they got to kick that
to someone else,

198
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,457
'cause I don't need no assault.

199
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,331
We don't pass on calls.

200
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:18,500
7-Adam-07, show us responding.

201
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:24,189
My tooth is loose.

202
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:25,502
Come on.

203
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,224
Ugh.

204
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:30,419
Hey. Officers.

205
00:07:30,475 --> 00:07:31,642
Sir, what happened?

206
00:07:31,748 --> 00:07:33,992
This guy stomped me inside the
bar 'cause I bumped into him.

207
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:37,519
I said I was sorry
then, bam, he did <i>this.</i>

208
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:38,663
What did he look like?

209
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,289
He's a white guy
wearing a red soccer jersey.

210
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,291
That's all I saw before I went fetal.

211
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:45,466
Stay here, bro. We got this.

212
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:57,527
I'm gonna call for backup.

213
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,770
Why? I can handle these guys.

214
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,207
Okay. You're primary.

215
00:08:11,384 --> 00:08:12,687
What the hell is wrong with you?!

216
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:14,088
Put the bloody game back on!

217
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,059
Sure... after you play <i>my</i> game.

218
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:18,224
It's called
"Which one of you hooligans"

219
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:19,906
"punched a nice man in the face?"

220
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,518
Control, send backup Code 3
for crowd control situation.

221
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,259
Great. My partner's
calling in the cavalry,

222
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,509
which means you have one minute
to make a choice.

223
00:08:27,603 --> 00:08:29,190
Either everyone goes to jail

224
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:31,330
for 647f, drunk in public,

225
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:34,283
<i>or</i> you hand over the guy
who threw the punches

226
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:36,400
and I can turn the game back on.

227
00:08:36,946 --> 00:08:39,439
So... what's it gonna be?

228
00:08:39,782 --> 00:08:41,127
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

229
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:42,417
Yeah!

230
00:08:42,514 --> 00:08:44,448
Game comes first, mate.

231
00:08:45,788 --> 00:08:46,922
Perfect.

232
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:52,855
That was awesome.

233
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:54,220
That was reckless.

234
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,629
Come on. Bad guy's in custody,
no one got hurt,

235
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:59,287
and I just checked off
"high-risk crowd control."

236
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,663
Code 4. Cancel backup.

237
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:12,814
None of these people are Craig Lawson.

238
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:15,195
- No.
- So we wait.

239
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,520
You sure there's nothing I can
do to help you with your DRP?

240
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:18,398
There really isn't.

241
00:09:18,435 --> 00:09:19,839
I could ask Ben to pull some strings.

242
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:21,162
He knows some people at City Hall.

243
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:22,716
Bending the rules
is how I got into this.

244
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,446
It's not gonna be how I get out.

245
00:09:24,904 --> 00:09:27,062
- I can't just do nothing.
- Sure you can.

246
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:29,443
When an idea pops into
your head, ignore it.

247
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:30,799
Easy.

248
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:34,603
You think maybe we should
introduce ourselves

249
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:36,367
to the family, offer our condolences?

250
00:09:36,404 --> 00:09:38,538
What did I say about ideas popping
in that big old head of yours?

251
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:40,196
Fine. We'll just...

252
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:43,010
stand at the back of a funeral viewing.

253
00:09:43,846 --> 00:09:45,188
You don't find that a little creepy?

254
00:09:45,225 --> 00:09:46,459
A <i>little</i> creepy, no.

255
00:09:46,524 --> 00:09:47,749
<i>Super</i> creepy, yes.

256
00:09:47,783 --> 00:09:49,718
But for now, it is our job.

257
00:09:54,711 --> 00:09:55,991
He's clean.

258
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:57,586
I'm really sorry.

259
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:59,867
You're always carrying, Fred.
What happened?

260
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:01,408
Oh, uh...

261
00:10:01,697 --> 00:10:03,298
Got my 30-day chip.

262
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:04,971
Wow.

263
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:06,727
Congratulations.

264
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:08,698
I feel bad I let you down.

265
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:10,236
It's all good. It's all good.

266
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:11,407
Say hi to Wilma for me.

267
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,378
All right. You're free to go.

268
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:16,493
You said he was a sure checkmark
for drug possession.

269
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,294
What can I say? He got clean.

270
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,877
It's inspiring, actually.

271
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:20,970
Well, forgive me if I don't appreciate

272
00:10:21,006 --> 00:10:22,112
the human-interest story.

273
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:23,485
I mean, Jackson at least has a chance

274
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,953
with only three calls, but seven?

275
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:26,988
Okay, people win the lottery every day,

276
00:10:27,023 --> 00:10:28,399
and with higher odds against them.

277
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:30,892
There are 18 million people
in the Greater Los Angeles area.

278
00:10:30,927 --> 00:10:33,995
We just need seven of them
to break very specific laws.

279
00:10:34,157 --> 00:10:36,495
<i>7-19, store owner reporting customer</i>

280
00:10:36,532 --> 00:10:38,567
<i>trying to pass counterfeit
bills near your location.</i>

281
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:40,791
<i>Hispanic male, brown hair, blue suit.</i>

282
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:42,504
7-Adam-19, responding.

283
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:43,992
I-I don't need a counterfeiting case.

284
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:46,375
Look at the bright side. You <i>do</i>
<i>need assaulting an officer.</i>

285
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,098
Maybe he'll take a swing at you.

286
00:10:49,967 --> 00:10:51,844
Thank you so much for coming.

287
00:10:56,558 --> 00:10:58,135
Here we go.

288
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:00,853
Your presence here
is incredibly disrespectful

289
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:02,327
to my father's memory.

290
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:04,493
This is a private viewing. I'm
gonna have to ask you to leave.

291
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:05,762
I'm sorry, sir. We can't do that.

292
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:07,305
Your brother is a wanted fugitive.

293
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:09,519
And after all the money that he's
stolen from you and your family,

294
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:10,790
I'd think you'd want us here

295
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:11,974
to catch him if he shows up.

296
00:11:12,034 --> 00:11:13,663
Craig's not gonna show up.

297
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:16,430
My father's dead
because of what Craig did.

298
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,057
So would you please leave

299
00:11:18,107 --> 00:11:19,674
and let us have this time to mourn?

300
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,141
Hey.

301
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,111
- Is that...
- I think it is.

302
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,313
Where the hell is my money?!

303
00:11:29,349 --> 00:11:30,399
- Aah!
- Hey!

304
00:11:33,414 --> 00:11:35,257
Hey!

305
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:37,367
Stay there! Stay down! Don't move!

306
00:11:37,404 --> 00:11:38,704
Give me your hands! Come here.

307
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:45,414
I only stabbed him 'cause
he scared the crap out of me.

308
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,831
I thought he was a zombie or something.

309
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:48,211
Good luck arguing that in court.

310
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,893
So, you faked your father's death

311
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,530
to trick your brother
into coming out of hiding?

312
00:11:51,566 --> 00:11:53,267
I had to. We need the money he stole.

313
00:11:53,304 --> 00:11:54,471
The business is going under.

314
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:55,601
Where's the money, Craig?!

315
00:11:55,638 --> 00:11:57,766
Same place as your soul... gone.

316
00:11:57,995 --> 00:11:59,262
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

317
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:00,899
We should probably
transport them separately.

318
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:02,342
You think?

319
00:12:05,064 --> 00:12:06,282
Jackpot.

320
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:08,361
Guy's out on probation for
a drug possession pinch.

321
00:12:08,398 --> 00:12:09,678
If he's holding, this'll give me one of

322
00:12:09,715 --> 00:12:10,714
the two checks I still need.

323
00:12:10,748 --> 00:12:11,784
<i>If</i> he's holding.

324
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,259
Driver, turn off the engine.

325
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:15,288
Reach out of the window
and open the door.

326
00:12:15,391 --> 00:12:17,504
Step out slowly. Hands where I can see.

327
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:23,484
- Where you headed today, sir?
- Work.

328
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,650
Mr. Gemetti, our system says
that you're on probation

329
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:26,788
for drug possession.

330
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,900
Got anything on you right now?

331
00:12:27,935 --> 00:12:29,009
No, sir.

332
00:12:29,046 --> 00:12:30,803
Mind if I pat you down?

333
00:12:30,939 --> 00:12:32,272
Sure.

334
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:36,242
I've been clean since
the arrest four years ago.

335
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,801
- Find anything?
- No.

336
00:12:41,815 --> 00:12:43,354
I'm gonna search the car.

337
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:45,366
Hands on the hood. Don't move.

338
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,399
What are you doing? This guy
has zero signs of drug use.

339
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:49,908
Eyes aren't dilated, no rapid speech,

340
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:51,134
or loss of coordination.

341
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:53,239
Possession does not require use.

342
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:55,745
He could be on his way home
right now to get high.

343
00:12:56,091 --> 00:13:00,061
Given his history, a search
is completely within reason.

344
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,255
Officer West, wrap it up.

345
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:18,982
- Bingo.
- That's not mine.

346
00:13:19,686 --> 00:13:21,654
I swear. I-I just bought
this car two months ago.

347
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,105
I've never even been in the back seat.

348
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:25,043
Your car, your baggy. You're
under arrest, Mr. Gemetti.

349
00:13:25,191 --> 00:13:27,238
- You got to be kidding me.
- Officer West, this is empty.

350
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:28,990
No, there's clearly residue.

351
00:13:29,027 --> 00:13:31,138
The law states if you can
see it and manipulate it,

352
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:32,250
it's possession.

353
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,332
We're not booking this guy

354
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:34,887
for a "lick" bag he didn't
even know was there.

355
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:36,964
Computer says he bought this car
at an auction two months ago,

356
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,525
and this bag looks older than <i>you.</i>

357
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:39,662
Hey! What...

358
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:40,847
Have your boss call me.

359
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,670
I'll tell them you were late
because you were helping

360
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:43,486
the LAPD on a case.

361
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:44,903
Thank you.

362
00:13:47,378 --> 00:13:48,701
First you tell me I'm too cavalier,

363
00:13:48,738 --> 00:13:50,969
and then you shoot me down
for being vigilant?

364
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:54,077
I shot you down because
you're being a bad cop.

365
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:55,678
Look, I get what's going on.

366
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:56,748
You spent a lifetime

367
00:13:56,785 --> 00:13:58,683
preparing to be squeaky clean,
like your old man.

368
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,451
Only now you've discovered
dirt under his nails,

369
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:01,490
so you're spinning out,

370
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:03,206
rebelling against how you were raised.

371
00:14:03,297 --> 00:14:05,195
I get it. And I'm giving you
room to work it out.

372
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:07,183
But that never gives you
an excuse to ruin a man's life

373
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,654
over a crime he didn't commit.

374
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:10,492
Try that again,
and I will end your career

375
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:12,218
before you even <i>see that exam.</i>

376
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:21,279
I still need seven calls.

377
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:23,439
You know how many I needed
when we started this morning?

378
00:14:23,476 --> 00:14:24,550
Seven.

379
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:26,219
If it makes you feel any better,
I only got one.

380
00:14:26,253 --> 00:14:27,541
- It doesn't.
- Look.

381
00:14:27,578 --> 00:14:28,721
You're gonna be fine.

382
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:30,423
Yes, you are in the suck right now.

383
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:32,118
You just have to bear down
and get through it.

384
00:14:32,155 --> 00:14:34,080
And... as motivation,

385
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:36,839
I booked us a spa day
the day after we take the exam.

386
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,731
Well, easy for you
to think about spa days.

387
00:14:38,765 --> 00:14:40,295
You've got all your boxes checked.

388
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:42,071
Okay, look, I hate
to play the age card.

389
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:43,729
- Do you?
- It's the only card I have.

390
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,501
But one of the things
you learn as you get older

391
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:47,671
is perspective.

392
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:49,790
I cannot tell you how
many times in my 20s

393
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:51,761
I thought I was going under for good.

394
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:53,832
I was married, with a young kid.

395
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:56,015
I had credit card debts
up to my eyeballs.

396
00:14:56,111 --> 00:14:57,717
It was bad.

397
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:58,918
But we survived.

398
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:02,054
We figured out a way
to just keep moving forward.

399
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,023
Well, that's great.

400
00:15:04,223 --> 00:15:06,504
but surviving isn't the same
as succeeding.

401
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,358
No, it's not, but in two days,

402
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:10,353
we're going to be on
the other side of this.

403
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:12,464
And odds are,
we're going to be sitting down

404
00:15:12,562 --> 00:15:14,875
taking this test <i>together.</i>

405
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:18,113
The pressure's getting to them.

406
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:19,372
It's getting to <i>me.</i>

407
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:20,535
Never had a rookie make it this far

408
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:21,839
and not qualify for the exam.

409
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:24,619
Nolan's over there
giving 'em a pep talk.

410
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,947
How can you tell?

411
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:27,633
'Cause he's been trying
to give <i>me</i> one all day.

412
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,738
He's right. You're gonna be fine.

413
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,949
Well, either way,
I'm off the fast track.

414
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,178
No more making chief by 40.

415
00:15:34,215 --> 00:15:35,949
Thank God. Being brass sounds awful.

416
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:37,841
I mean, it's all politics and stats.

417
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,278

boom.

451
00:17:23,173 --> 00:17:24,799

Yeah, we put out a BOLO
on the car. So far, nothing.

480

He would've gotten it
off the street quickly,

481
00:18:28,636 --> 00:18:30,098
loaded it in the back of a semi.

504
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:21,056
said there's been more stolen cars

in this one neighborhood
in the last month

506
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:24,375
than all of Mid-Wilshire last year.

507
00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:25,615
I hope so.

508
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:33,942
Those plates don't match that car.

509
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:36,185

521
00:20:02,947 --> 00:20:04,590
It's been a rough year.

522
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:06,550
When the one we registered broke down,

523
00:20:06,584 --> 00:20:08,359

00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:35,909
You can cite her for the false plates

533
00:20:35,946 --> 00:20:37,430
and check a box

534
00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:39,329
or cut her loose

535
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:41,539
and risk not being able
to take the final exam.

536
00:20:42,497 --> 00:20:45,222
I don't want to be that cop.

537
00:20:45,532 --> 00:20:47,190
This whole thing is pissing me off.

538
00:20:47,253 --> 00:20:48,691
I-It's just...

539
00:20:48,993 --> 00:20:50,561
I don't want to do it this way...

540
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:52,101
running around
trying to tick off boxes.

541
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,586
It's not me.

542
00:20:54,966 --> 00:20:56,066
Okay.

543
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:57,634
Then give her a warning.

544
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:04,773
All right, listen,
I'm not gonna write you up,

545
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:06,695
but you can't ever do this again, okay?

546
00:21:06,845 --> 00:21:08,372
Thank you.

547
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:10,425
Drive safe.

548
00:21:20,992 --> 00:21:22,664
So, wanna know the good news?

549
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:26,081
This counts as an ethical dilemma.

550
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:27,950
Which means you <i>ha</i> checked a box.

551
00:21:29,567 --> 00:21:31,635
Only six more to go.

552
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:38,024
Easy.

553
00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:39,510
What are we doing?

554
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,628
Having a sleepover.

555
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:42,145
- Sit and relax.
- That sounds fun.

556
00:21:42,346 --> 00:21:43,680
Why here and not at my place?

557
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:44,934
Oh, 'cause your high-tech toilets

558
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,059
freak me out a little bit.

559
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,182
One unexpected colonic

560
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:48,276
is my limit.

561
00:21:48,313 --> 00:21:49,646
- You hungry?
- No.

562
00:21:49,807 --> 00:21:51,036
But I could use a scotch.

563
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:53,864
Scotch is really not
a good mixer with painkillers.

564
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:55,692
- Says who?
- Everyone.

565
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:58,700
Listen.

566
00:21:58,737 --> 00:22:01,093
You know why we're having a sleepover?

567
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,500
'Cause I was carjacked?

568
00:22:03,535 --> 00:22:05,458
That, um, is part of it.

569
00:22:05,737 --> 00:22:08,472
But mostly because of what comes next.

570
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:11,844
Remember I told you about
that bank robbery I was in?

571
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:13,305
- Back home?
- Yeah.

572
00:22:13,342 --> 00:22:14,773
It's why you joined the force.
You told me.

573
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,811
What I <i>didn't</i> tell you was...

574
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:18,732
how bad it messed me up.

575
00:22:19,884 --> 00:22:21,696
And for a month after that,

576
00:22:21,733 --> 00:22:22,828
before I joined the academy,

577
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:24,094
I...

578
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,772
I would be fine... and then...

579
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:31,809
...suddenly, I would just
see that gun in my face.

580
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,698
Sweat through my clothes on a cold day.

581
00:22:34,732 --> 00:22:35,727
I broke down crying

582
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:37,124
at the drive-through
at the Dairy Queen.

583
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,148
No reason.

584
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:39,603
Well, not for <i>no</i> reason.

585
00:22:39,637 --> 00:22:41,538
No. Not for no reason.

586
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:44,908
The point is,

587
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:47,000
yesterday, you felt safe.

588
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:50,189
Tomorrow, you won't.

589
00:22:51,463 --> 00:22:53,101
But until you do,

590
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:55,419
I'm gonna be here for you.

591
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:58,383
How's that sound?

592
00:22:58,623 --> 00:22:59,977
Yeah.

593
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,630
Sounds good.

594
00:23:04,954 --> 00:23:06,430
Chen, you still need six.

595
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:07,706
West, you've got one.

596
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:09,081
And, Nolan, front desk duty.

597
00:23:09,118 --> 00:23:11,372
All right, that's it.
Be safe out there.

598
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:12,930
Make a hole, make a hole.
Coming through.

599
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:17,064
Hey. Missed you in there.

600
00:23:17,101 --> 00:23:18,883
I bet. Front desk duty?

601
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:20,762
Yeah. Everyone else is under the gun,

602
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,000
so I'll be spending the day
stamping forms.

603
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:25,514
Um, I know you told me not to,

604
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,182
but I wrote a little memo

605
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:28,985
about how great it is,

606
00:23:29,022 --> 00:23:30,148
to have you as a training officer.

607
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:31,669
I know it doesn't matter.

608
00:23:35,827 --> 00:23:36,960
It does.

609
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:38,446
You gonna show it to the chief?

610
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,617
Probably not.

611
00:23:39,948 --> 00:23:41,549
Hey. You ready?

612
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:43,508
Ready.

613
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:45,736
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

614
00:23:49,613 --> 00:23:50,898
I should just throw in the towel.

615
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:53,117
There's no way we're gonna
check six boxes in one day.

616
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,945
I'm not training a quitter, Boot.

617
00:23:55,043 --> 00:23:57,389
We fight until the bell rings.
There's no other way.

618
00:23:58,226 --> 00:23:59,375
<i>7-Adam-19,</i>

619
00:23:59,412 --> 00:24:01,855
<i>you still need a destruction
of city property?</i>

620
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:02,974
Roger that.

621
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,252
<i>911 just got a call.</i>

622
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,025
<i>Two blocks over from Wilshire and Pine.</i>

623
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:07,991
<i>Single car accident
while driving on the sidewalk.</i>

624
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:10,027
What'd I tell you? We're still in this.

625
00:24:10,256 --> 00:24:12,991
7-Adam-19, show us responding.

626
00:24:18,036 --> 00:24:19,136
Put me to work.

627
00:24:19,232 --> 00:24:20,447
I can't help Bishop today,

628
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:22,518
but I can help you catch the guy
who hurt my friend.

629
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:24,307
So get me pulled off the front desk

630
00:24:24,344 --> 00:24:26,009
and assigned to this case.

631
00:24:26,044 --> 00:24:27,111
Okay.

632
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:29,012
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

633
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,908
Okay. Yes. Great.

634
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,688
Where do we start?

635
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,906
Have you ever driven a Lamborghini?

636
00:24:38,156 --> 00:24:41,291
The LAPD had this just laying around?

637
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:43,400
Asset seizure from Narcotics.

638
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:46,196
You wanna drive it?

639
00:24:46,476 --> 00:24:47,798
Hell yeah!

640
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:55,622
12-year-old John Nolan
crapping his pants right now!

641
00:24:58,141 --> 00:24:59,510
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

642
00:24:59,696 --> 00:25:01,512
Oh!

643
00:25:01,647 --> 00:25:03,014
Oh, ho!

644
00:25:03,157 --> 00:25:05,215
Oh, my God. Yes!

645
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:10,053
I...

646
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:11,548
What happened?

647
00:25:11,641 --> 00:25:13,518
It's a bait car, equipped with cameras,

648
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,731
remote door locks, and a kill switch.

649
00:25:15,821 --> 00:25:17,813
Carjacker steals the car,
we cut the engine,

650
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,410
- lock him inside.
- Exactly.

651
00:25:19,555 --> 00:25:20,721
How will he know where to find it?

652
00:25:20,758 --> 00:25:22,212
C.I.s are set to put the word out

653
00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:23,550
as soon as it's in place.

654
00:25:23,977 --> 00:25:26,649
Car like this will get our
boy's ass in gear real quick.

655
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:28,689
And we'll be there
waiting to hook him up.

656
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,431
Were you serious
about letting me drive?

657
00:25:31,477 --> 00:25:33,410
The motor pool has your picture
on a dart board.

658
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:34,688
- What do <i>you</i> think?
- Yeah.

659
00:25:34,725 --> 00:25:36,243
That's... fair.

660
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,565
Control, 7-Adam-07,

661
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:48,452
can you run plate
5-Paul-Charlie-Ida-410?

662
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:51,094
Ma'am, were you driving this vehicle?

663
00:25:51,235 --> 00:25:52,689
Yeah.

664
00:25:53,097 --> 00:25:54,264
No.

665
00:25:54,508 --> 00:25:55,866
It's destruction of city property.

666
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,534
That's one more box checked.

667
00:25:57,837 --> 00:25:59,798
<i>5-Paul-Charlie-Ida-410</i>

668
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:01,776
<i>just reported 10-8-51.</i>

669
00:26:01,813 --> 00:26:04,032
RP says girlfriend took his car
<i>without permission</i>

670
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:05,119
<i>20 minutes ago.</i>

671
00:26:05,174 --> 00:26:06,237
That bastard!

672
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,089
And grand theft auto
brings your total to three.

673
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:09,253
It's your lucky day, Boot.

674
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,393
Hey...

675
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,115
Hey! Stop!

676
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,784
Oh!

677
00:26:13,818 --> 00:26:15,319
And that's technically a carjacking.

678
00:26:15,477 --> 00:26:16,954
Thing has a motor. It counts.

679
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:18,922
Ma'am, do not attempt
to run away again.

680
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:21,056
- What's your name?
- Alexander Hamilton.

681
00:26:21,157 --> 00:26:23,548
False I.D. to an officer
brings us to five.

682
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,584
I'm gonna need to see
your driver's license, please.

683
00:26:27,415 --> 00:26:29,758
Assault on a police officer.
That's six.

684
00:26:29,907 --> 00:26:31,134
Ooh!

685
00:26:31,171 --> 00:26:32,604
Not bad, Officer Chen.

686
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:33,993
Go get her.

687
00:26:42,106 --> 00:26:44,107
So, how's Ben doing?

688
00:26:44,212 --> 00:26:45,618
Bit of a rough night.

689
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,142
But he'll make it through.

690
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:48,565
I know a good therapist,

691
00:26:48,602 --> 00:26:51,191
specializes in violence-related trauma.

692
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:53,615
Helped me through some rough moments.

693
00:26:53,828 --> 00:26:55,129
I'll pass it along.

694
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:56,516
Thank you.

695
00:27:04,168 --> 00:27:05,435
Camo cap.

696
00:27:05,587 --> 00:27:06,798
Nose ring.

697
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:08,237
Neck tattoo.

698
00:27:08,274 --> 00:27:09,473
That's our guy.

699
00:27:09,665 --> 00:27:10,725
We move in?

700
00:27:10,775 --> 00:27:13,854
No, let's wait till he's inside first.

701
00:27:15,956 --> 00:27:17,375
That's a scanner.

702
00:27:17,426 --> 00:27:18,666
Goes through all the remote

703
00:27:18,702 --> 00:27:19,758
key fob combinations

704
00:27:19,795 --> 00:27:22,330
until it unlocks the car.

705
00:27:46,758 --> 00:27:48,429
Hey.

706
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:50,258
Show me your hands.

707
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,188
Step out... nice and slow.

708
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:04,408
You know the drill. Hands on your head,

709
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:05,534
interlace your fingers.

710
00:28:05,571 --> 00:28:06,673
Got him?

711
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,876
Got him.

712
00:28:07,913 --> 00:28:09,302
Do not move.

713
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:12,322
Gun.

714
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:17,995
What happened to your hand?

715
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,196
I don't remember.

716
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:23,146
How 'bout I remind you?

717
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:25,038
Is there a problem, Officer Nolan?

718
00:28:26,154 --> 00:28:27,320
No, sir.

719
00:28:27,511 --> 00:28:28,706
You're under arrest.

720
00:28:28,743 --> 00:28:29,943
You have the right to remain silent.

721
00:28:29,979 --> 00:28:31,678
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

722
00:28:31,715 --> 00:28:32,815
in a court of law.

723
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:34,573
You have the right to talk to a lawyer

724
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,548
and have him present
while you're being questioned.

725
00:28:36,657 --> 00:28:38,253
If you cannot afford a lawyer,

726
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,456
one will be appointed to you
at no expense.

727
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:42,599
Do you understand your rights
as I have read them to you?

728
00:28:42,766 --> 00:28:44,167
- Yeah.
- Then get in.

729
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:50,387
We got him. I can't wait to tell Ben.

730
00:28:50,424 --> 00:28:51,860
- Take a beat.
- Why?

731
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,493
'Cause this guy's a small piece
of a much bigger operation.

732
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:56,344
If he's willing to give up his employer,

733
00:28:56,383 --> 00:28:58,148
the D.A. will let him walk.

734
00:28:58,243 --> 00:28:59,767
That guy just put my
friend in a hospital.

735
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,127
- He has to pay for that.
- Yeah,

736
00:29:01,163 --> 00:29:02,226
but the guy he works for has

737
00:29:02,263 --> 00:29:03,587
put people in the ground.

738
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:06,484
Flipping a carjacker
for a bigger fish is S.O.P.

739
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:08,815
So if letting this guy go
is the price we have to pay,

740
00:29:08,852 --> 00:29:10,397
then we're gonna pay it.

741
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:13,369
Is that gonna be a problem?

742
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:15,168
No, sir.

743
00:29:24,858 --> 00:29:26,459
You okay?

744
00:29:26,736 --> 00:29:29,061
- Fine.
- You're allowed to be nervous.

745
00:29:29,181 --> 00:29:30,548
I'm not nervous.

746
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:32,092
I'm frustrated.

747
00:29:32,202 --> 00:29:34,462
I've worked harder than anyone
in the past eight years,

748
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:36,915
and now it might all get
taken away because of <i>this?</i>

749
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:38,471
Because of one question I answered

750
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:40,106
before I even started the academy?

751
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,753
That's not gonna fly.

752
00:29:42,744 --> 00:29:44,717
You got to own up to this, Talia.

753
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:47,014
You are one of our best,

754
00:29:47,108 --> 00:29:48,948
but you can't tell me you didn't
know what you were doing

755
00:29:48,984 --> 00:29:50,368
when you left Dylan's name off the list

756
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:52,280
but included your
other foster siblings.

757
00:29:52,352 --> 00:29:54,835
Chief Williams may be unpredictable,

758
00:29:54,888 --> 00:29:57,190
but the one thing he's not
gonna stand for is B.S.

759
00:29:57,404 --> 00:29:59,779
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

760
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,037
Let's go.

761
00:30:11,552 --> 00:30:14,287
Chief Williams Officer Bishop,
Sergeant Grey, have a seat.

762
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:18,055
Thank you.

763
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:20,344
Sir, I'd like to make
a statement before we get...

764
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:21,727
I'm sure you would.

765
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,542
I know you're here to sing
Officer Bishop's praises,

766
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:25,915
and you wouldn't be wrong.

767
00:30:25,952 --> 00:30:28,681
I've looked at her file.
She's a fine officer.

768
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,523
Here's what I want to know.

769
00:30:30,649 --> 00:30:32,392
You left your foster brother,

770
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:34,998
a known felon, off your PHQ.

771
00:30:35,328 --> 00:30:37,363
In short, you lied.

772
00:30:37,743 --> 00:30:40,048
Tell me why that's not a problem.

773
00:30:42,402 --> 00:30:43,937
I can't do that, sir.

774
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:47,206
What I did <i>is</i> a problem.

775
00:30:49,124 --> 00:30:51,058
I violated the trust of this department

776
00:30:51,095 --> 00:30:53,003
before I even started the job.

777
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:56,461
I could tell you I did
it to protect myself

778
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,716
and my future here,

779
00:30:57,753 --> 00:30:59,566
but that is also inexcusable.

780
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,520
Because that meant pretending
that my foster brother

781
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:03,201
was not a part of my life.

782
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:05,363
I could've helped him.

783
00:31:05,706 --> 00:31:07,438
But I chose to cut him out.

784
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:10,730
I have a lot to be sorry for.

785
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:12,966
And I <i>am.</i>

786
00:31:15,135 --> 00:31:17,136
Well, all right, then.

787
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:20,812
Detective Ruiz, would you begin?

788
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:22,933
Officer Bishop, Internal Affairs

789
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,715
has combed through your
entire career with the LAPD

790
00:31:25,752 --> 00:31:28,773
to make sure that your
association with this felon

791
00:31:28,982 --> 00:31:30,972
has not further impaired your judgment.

792
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:32,379
In doing so, I have found

793
00:31:32,416 --> 00:31:35,181
several discrepancies,
errors, and omissions.

794
00:31:35,289 --> 00:31:37,613
I think it's easiest if we just
start with the most recent

795
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,106
and work our way backwards.

796
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:41,722
Now, in October of this past year,

797
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,900
you failed to secure your LAPD vehicle.

798
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:47,189
He gave you the keys.

799
00:31:47,467 --> 00:31:49,401
He did exactly what you told him to do,

800
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,136
and you beat him to a pulp anyway.

801
00:31:51,632 --> 00:31:53,232
I don't know what you're talking about.

802
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:55,372
I just want to know why.

803
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,209
Or is that just the
kind of person you are?

804
00:31:57,244 --> 00:31:59,106
I don't got to talk to you about this.

805
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:01,572
Detective said if I give up my boss,

806
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:02,725
I walk free.

807
00:32:02,845 --> 00:32:04,257
Well, I hope he doesn't show.

808
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,907
Oh, he will.

809
00:32:06,603 --> 00:32:08,220
My intel's good.

810
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:12,046
Walked the perimeter.

811
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:14,111
We're good to go.

812
00:32:15,462 --> 00:32:18,478
Hey, I heard your boy Jackson
got his last checkmark.

813
00:32:18,744 --> 00:32:21,320
He and Lopez folded
into the strike team.

814
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:31,181
That's him... black jacket.

815
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:37,103
And that's Ben's car.

816
00:32:37,493 --> 00:32:39,354
We have positive I.D. on our target.

817
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:41,226
All units, prepare to move in.

818
00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:03,208
Police! Show me your hands!

819
00:33:03,384 --> 00:33:05,525
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Nobody move!

820
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:07,465
Hands! Hands!

821
00:33:07,705 --> 00:33:10,056
Nolan, go after him!
Lopez, Jackson, with me!

822
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:11,658
Hands where I can see 'em!

823
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:12,944
Man #4 Turn around!

824
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:16,611
- Jackson!
- I'm driving.

825
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:18,048
Fine!

826
00:33:31,011 --> 00:33:32,291
<i>We need to flank him.</i>

827
00:33:32,327 --> 00:33:33,514
<i>Take Broadway.</i>

828
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,526
7-Adam-15, foot pursuit west,

829
00:33:39,563 --> 00:33:41,246
alley of Chinatown Plaza!

830
00:34:11,444 --> 00:34:12,705
Suspect headed east

831
00:34:12,742 --> 00:34:14,361
on Hill Street.

832
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:15,869
We can cut him off in the plaza.

833
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:17,583
Wait! What are you doing?!

834
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:20,455
Brake!

835
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:24,779
Ma'am! Are you okay?

836
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,774
Police! Everybody down!

837
00:34:43,337 --> 00:34:44,588
Gotcha.

838
00:34:49,551 --> 00:34:51,519
Freeze, punk! Don't you make a move!

839
00:34:55,532 --> 00:34:56,847
You okay?

840
00:34:56,955 --> 00:34:58,624
No!

841
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,427
Car thieves... are supposed
to have <i>car</i> chases,

842
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:02,923
not <i>foot</i> chases.

843
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:11,303
Control, suspect in custody.

844
00:35:18,846 --> 00:35:20,813
Hi, I heard it wasn't going so well.

845
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:22,267
Not particularly.

846
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:23,850
What the hell are you doing
here, Nolan?

847
00:35:23,887 --> 00:35:25,383
Standing up for what's right.

848
00:35:25,525 --> 00:35:26,658
Nolan, don't!

849
00:35:26,732 --> 00:35:28,182
- Don't!
- Hey!

850
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:29,940
Son?

851
00:35:29,977 --> 00:35:31,535
- Are you lost?
- No, sir.

852
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,105
I'm Officer Bishop's rookie,
and I need to be heard.

853
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:36,629
No, you don't. My apologies, sir.

854
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,442
- Officer Nolan was just lea...
- Hold on, Sergeant.

855
00:35:38,477 --> 00:35:40,211
If the man needs to be heard,

856
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,738
he needs to be heard.

857
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:45,015
Better be good, though.

858
00:35:45,088 --> 00:35:46,634
Yeah, it better be.

859
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:49,086
Sir, um...

860
00:35:51,156 --> 00:35:52,588
Sorry, Chief.

861
00:35:52,752 --> 00:35:54,692
- It's been a bit of a day.
- For me, too.

862
00:35:54,923 --> 00:35:56,594
Yes, sir. Sorry about that.

863
00:35:56,884 --> 00:35:58,019
Here's the thing.

864
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,676
For the last six months,
I have watched Officer Bishop

865
00:36:00,713 --> 00:36:02,836
selflessly give to this city.

866
00:36:03,033 --> 00:36:04,533
She has made people safer,

867
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,273
changed people for the better.

868
00:36:07,934 --> 00:36:09,434
And...

869
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:12,129
inspired me to be
a better police officer.

870
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,353
I entered this program at a deficit...

871
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,556
older than all the other rookies...

872
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:19,018
by far.

873
00:36:20,752 --> 00:36:22,153
But Officer Bishop showed me how

874
00:36:22,187 --> 00:36:24,104
to make my life experience

875
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:25,795
work <i>for</i> me...

876
00:36:26,577 --> 00:36:28,354
so that one day, I might be...

877
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:30,595
half the cop she is.

878
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,307
I know I'm nobody
in the department, sir.

879
00:36:35,344 --> 00:36:36,815
I'm still on probation, still learning

880
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:37,886
all the rules and regulations...

881
00:36:37,923 --> 00:36:39,246
Oh, like the three you broke

882
00:36:39,283 --> 00:36:40,730
when you pushed your way in here?

883
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:42,989
Actually, I can answer that.

884
00:36:43,064 --> 00:36:45,410
Disobeying a direct order,
disregarding chain of command,

885
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:47,808
and conduct unbecoming of an officer.

886
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:50,181
Then you do understand that, uh,

887
00:36:50,215 --> 00:36:52,483
there's a certain risk
to your actions here today.

888
00:36:52,517 --> 00:36:54,113
Yes, sir, I do.

889
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:57,269
But I was raised to stand up
for the people I care for.

890
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:02,999
I realize what Officer Bishop
did was an ethical violation,

891
00:37:03,036 --> 00:37:05,170
and there needs to be consequences.

892
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:07,987
But she taught me
that this job is about judgment

893
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:10,896
and fairness and compassion.

894
00:37:11,469 --> 00:37:13,909
Officer Bishop wasn't trying
to game the system.

895
00:37:13,946 --> 00:37:15,643
She was simply determined to be

896
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,575
the best police officer
this city's ever seen.

897
00:37:20,312 --> 00:37:22,146
And I needed you to know that.

898
00:37:22,368 --> 00:37:24,922
You're the officer
who was with Captain Andersen

899
00:37:24,959 --> 00:37:26,317
when she died.

900
00:37:28,253 --> 00:37:29,574
I was.

901
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,022
Huh.

902
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:33,780
Sergeant...

903
00:37:34,024 --> 00:37:37,249
when am I administrating
this recruit's oral exam?

904
00:37:37,362 --> 00:37:39,168
A week from today, sir.

905
00:37:39,731 --> 00:37:42,233
Until that majestic day of reckoning,

906
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:45,132
Officer Nolan,
get the hell out of my office.

907
00:37:45,237 --> 00:37:46,470
Yes, sir. Yes.

908
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:54,445
So, are you trying to get fired?

909
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:56,282
- No, sir.
- Then you're just a moron?

910
00:37:56,318 --> 00:37:58,315
- Yes, sir.
- But he's <i>my</i> moron.

911
00:37:58,499 --> 00:37:59,618
Do you think it helped?

912
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:00,965
I don't think it <i>hurt.</i>

913
00:38:01,109 --> 00:38:02,530
Well, we'll see.

914
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,874
Regardless, the Chief's gonna
be coming for you next week.

915
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:06,557
Well, let him come. I'll be ready.

916
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,187
You know he can test you
on anything from the rook book,

917
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:11,326
penal code, and duty manual...
anything at all.

918
00:38:11,385 --> 00:38:13,319
I know them forwards and backwards.

919
00:38:13,462 --> 00:38:14,691
Really?

920
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:17,101
Page 47, rook book.

921
00:38:17,393 --> 00:38:18,793
How many commas?

922
00:38:27,646 --> 00:38:28,952
You okay?

923
00:38:29,118 --> 00:38:31,186
I really screwed up.

924
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:34,561
I don't know what I was thinking.
I just...

925
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:39,015
I don't know who I'm
supposed to be right now.

926
00:38:39,196 --> 00:38:42,226
And when I pushed
to be something I'm not, I...

927
00:38:43,374 --> 00:38:44,639
...almost got someone killed.

928
00:38:44,676 --> 00:38:45,999
The hell you doing, Boot?

929
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:47,708
You're still one shy on your checklist.

930
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:50,534
I... It's too late. Shift's over.

931
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:52,290
Shift's over when we punch out,

932
00:38:52,327 --> 00:38:54,327
and we're not punching out till
we get you a meth possession.

933
00:38:54,397 --> 00:38:55,653
Come on. Grey approved the OT.

934
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,980
Let's go.

935
00:38:58,815 --> 00:39:00,085
Um...

936
00:39:00,145 --> 00:39:02,044
Go. I'm fine.

937
00:39:03,363 --> 00:39:04,764
- Are you sure?
- Really.

938
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:06,459
We'll talk later.

939
00:39:15,106 --> 00:39:16,373
Your boot gave a nice speech.

940
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,813
Can I help you with something?

941
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:21,993
I'm just here to inform you
that it may take a week or two

942
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:24,473
before we make a final decision
in your matter.

943
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:26,435
Then I'll see you in a week or two.

944
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:29,835
However...

945
00:39:31,882 --> 00:39:33,777
...I could give you a decision <i>today.</i>

946
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,697
Right now, as a matter of fact.

947
00:39:36,681 --> 00:39:38,582
And what would that decision be?

948
00:39:38,741 --> 00:39:39,917
Cleared on all charges.

949
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:41,652
If? It sounds like there's an "if."

950
00:39:41,835 --> 00:39:44,065
You're smart. That's why
you're perfect for this.

951
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:45,631
For what?

952
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,201
I need someone here
to be my eyes and ears

953
00:39:48,247 --> 00:39:49,902
at the Mid-Wilshire Station.

954
00:39:50,351 --> 00:39:52,663
You want me to be a rat
for Internal Affairs?

955
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,970
I know it sounds bad.

956
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:55,933
But it will save your job.

957
00:39:56,155 --> 00:39:58,624
The Chief takes my
recommendations very seriously.

958
00:39:58,905 --> 00:40:01,169
Let's be honest...
your Boot's speech was good,

959
00:40:01,506 --> 00:40:03,226
but it wasn't <i>that</i> good.

960
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:04,716
Think about it.

961
00:40:04,876 --> 00:40:08,023
We'll talk soon.

962
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:12,516
Sorry. Wish I had better news.

963
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:13,967
Ah, doesn't matter.

964
00:40:14,101 --> 00:40:15,984
It matters to <i>me.</i>
I want you to have closure.

965
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:18,234
Did closure help you
after the bank robbery?

966
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:21,593
Not really.

967
00:40:21,663 --> 00:40:23,264
Which is why I'm out of here.

968
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,256
Tomorrow morning,
wheels-up to St. Barts.

969
00:40:26,431 --> 00:40:28,866
From there, who knows.

970
00:40:29,101 --> 00:40:31,452
You think a change of scenery
will help ease the trauma?

971
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:33,837
I think a cold drink
on white sand's a good start.

972
00:40:33,903 --> 00:40:35,300
Oh.

973
00:40:35,937 --> 00:40:37,540
Well, disappearing for a few months...

974
00:40:37,577 --> 00:40:38,877
you have that option.

975
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,677
Most folks don't have that.

976
00:40:40,835 --> 00:40:44,103
Got to sit and try
to deal with their PTSD

977
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,571
while still holding
their lives together.

978
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:49,281
Oh, so I should feel bad I have money?

979
00:40:49,863 --> 00:40:51,194
No.

980
00:40:52,121 --> 00:40:53,741
I'm saying...

981
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,333
escape is a privilege.

982
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,756
But you won't really be escaping.

983
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:03,900
All the stress and nightmares
and feelings from the attack,

984
00:41:03,937 --> 00:41:06,437
they're gonna come along
to the beach with you.

985
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:08,914
And I can tell you that
because I've been there.

986
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:13,644
The only thing that helped me
make it to the other side was...

987
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:17,768
...becoming a cop.

988
00:41:18,546 --> 00:41:20,751
- You think I should join up?
- No! No.

989
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,101
No.

990
00:41:22,171 --> 00:41:24,056
Nobody wants that.

991
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:26,218
But you could think about

992
00:41:26,255 --> 00:41:28,583
using the trauma to motivate you.

993
00:41:29,374 --> 00:41:31,762
Make something positive
out of a terrible experience.

994
00:41:34,332 --> 00:41:37,123
That victim's services woman
gave me her card.

995
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,493
I could write her a check.

996
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,830
You could.

997
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:43,361
And... you should.

998
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,944
But you think I need
to be more hands-on?

999
00:41:47,077 --> 00:41:48,612
I think helping people...

1000
00:41:48,646 --> 00:41:50,901
when you can look them in the eye...

1001
00:41:51,765 --> 00:41:53,361
is one of the most fulfilling things

1002
00:41:53,398 --> 00:41:55,052
I've ever done with my life.

1003
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,701
I'll call her in the morning.

1004
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:04,538
Good.

1005
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:06,079
I hate ginger ale.

1006
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:08,491
I know.
