00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:09,757
He's clean.

2
00:00:09,788 --> 00:00:10,859
See?

3
00:00:10,945 --> 00:00:12,921
Just out for a stroll.
A stroll?

4
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:15,808
It is sad the way you guys
are harassing an innocent man.

5
00:00:15,894 --> 00:00:18,047
Officer Nolan, are you familiar
with the Crack Almanac?

6
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:20,180
- Is it available on Kindle?
- Four basic principles...

7
00:00:20,265 --> 00:00:22,300
Look Out, Cook Out,
Cash Out, Stash Out.

8
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:24,301
Cook out...
cook cocaine into crack.

9
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:25,960
- Look out...
- For the cops.

10
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:27,594
You really could stand
to work on that one.

11
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,701
Stash out.

12
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:29,969
You want to stash
the rocks nearby

13
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:31,601
so if the cops catch you,
you're clean.

a real good hustler

00:01:52,638 --> 00:01:54,056
I can't believe
we don't get

52
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:55,665
a single vacation
or personal day

53
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:57,260
during our entire
probationary year.

54
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:58,775
It's how we prove
our commitment.

Oh.

- Jessica.
- Jessica.

60
00:02:07,165 --> 00:02:08,337
No.

61
00:02:08,454 --> 00:02:09,540
Yeah, okay, a little.

62
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:11,228
- Yes, yes, yeah, a little.
- Yeah.

63
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:13,494
That's great.
You... You seem really happy.

64
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,196
- Thank you.
- Oh, we should do a double date.

65
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:16,379
I'd love for you
to meet Gino.

66
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:18,219
Sounds great, but she's
out of town right now.

67
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,299
She's, uh, doing a lecture

68
00:02:19,384 --> 00:02:20,839
at the Department
of Homeland Security.

69
00:02:20,924 --> 00:02:22,376
Can I have your attention?

70
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:23,603
Let's go, Boots.

71
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:25,572
Everyone, gather up.

72
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:29,603
All right, guys, listen up.

73
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:31,879
Internal Affairs
will be conducting

74
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:33,572
random integrity tests
this week.

75
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:35,670
Reversals.
That's right, Officer West.

76
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,089
What's a reversal?

77
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:39,299
Where cops go undercover
to rat out other cops.

78
00:02:39,384 --> 00:02:41,228
IA officers will be
spending the week

79
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:42,629
pretending to be criminals

80
00:02:42,714 --> 00:02:44,392
so they can analyze
how we treat them.

81
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:45,933
So, what Tim said.

82
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,879
Do you think this is a joke,
Officer Lopez? Officer Bradford?

83
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:51,299
- No, ma'am.
- No, ma'am.

84
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,462
Good.
'Cause I take it very seriously.

85
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:54,916
If you have to change
your behavior

86
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:57,706
because of these reversals,
we have a problem.

87
00:02:57,797 --> 00:03:01,042
My officers do things
the right way... every day.

88
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,329
Is that understood?

89
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:03,589
Yes, ma'am.

90
00:03:03,674 --> 00:03:05,009
Dismissed.

91
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:06,969
Are reversals
really that hard to spot?

92
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:09,697
I mean, you can usually
make a cop by the way they walk.

93
00:03:09,783 --> 00:03:11,548
Not these guys.
They train for this.

94
00:03:11,634 --> 00:03:13,129
It's like the Super Bowl
to them.

95
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:14,299
They go all-in.

96
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:15,839
About two years ago,
they took over a bank

97
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:18,679
and masqueraded as robbers
just to test our response time.

98
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:19,879
They cleared
the bank out first.

99
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:21,589
Every teller and customer
was a plant.

100
00:03:21,674 --> 00:03:22,719
That's dedicated.

101
00:03:22,804 --> 00:03:24,339
No, it's a waste of time
and resources,

102
00:03:24,424 --> 00:03:26,799
which is why I make it my mission
to seek and destroy reversals.

103
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:28,129
I don't see
what the fuss is about.

104
00:03:28,214 --> 00:03:30,179
A cop should be held
to the highest standards.

105
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:32,719
Of course you side with IA.
Your dad's in charge.

106
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:34,839
Okay, it's not about my dad.
The integrity of a co...

107
00:03:34,924 --> 00:03:37,299
- Hey.
- Morning.

108
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,629
Here to see a client?

109
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:40,464
Yeah.

110
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,694
I won't keep you.

111
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:47,001
Did... Did you guys
break up?

112
00:03:48,476 --> 00:03:51,101
No. We had... a few dates.
Then we stopped.

113
00:03:51,187 --> 00:03:52,908
Sounds like
a breakup to me.

114
00:03:53,146 --> 00:03:54,468
- What happened?
- Nothing.

115
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:56,179
- It's fine. Let's go.
- Okay.

116
00:03:56,264 --> 00:03:59,589
<i>7-Adam-15, disturbance
at the Altobello Hotel.</i>

117
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,457
You're saying
this is my fault?

118
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,799
You're damn right
it's your fault!

119
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:05,509
Do you have any idea
how much my car costs?

120
00:04:05,594 --> 00:04:07,379
Please, ma'am.
If we could take this inside...

121
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:10,469
What seems to be the problem here?
Valet destroyed my car.

122
00:04:10,735 --> 00:04:12,507
- That car?
- Yeah, look, the paint job.

123
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:13,633
Right there.

124
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:16,129
That scratch
will buff right out.

125
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,379
- You're lying. He's lying!
- This is a civil matter.

126
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:19,565
Feel free
to take photographs

127
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,759
and send it in
for an insurance claim.

128
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,089
You mean you're not
gonna arrest him?

129
00:04:22,174 --> 00:04:23,339
There's no crime here,
ma'am.

130
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:24,469
Oh, like hell there isn't.

131
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:26,129
I know you did it
on purpose, too!

132
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:27,469
'Cause I caught you
starting at my ass

133
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:28,884
when I gave you the car.

134
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,533
I see nicer asses
on the regular.

135
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:33,549
No! Let go!

136
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,734
- Oh!
- Drop that knife!

137
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,859
- Oh!
- Let go of me!

138
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,049
I'm sorry.
Sorry about that.

139
00:04:38,134 --> 00:04:39,304
Whoa. Sorry about that.

140
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,633
I didn't mean
for that to happen.

141
00:04:40,718 --> 00:04:41,723
Yeah, right.

142
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,250
Is that how you get off?

143
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:45,617
You handcuff hot girls
and rip off their clothes?!

144
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:46,703
No, ma'am.

145
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:49,188
I'm just saying,
cops don't have

146
00:04:49,274 --> 00:04:50,729
the best reputation
right now.

147
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:52,839
And if these tests
help the public trust us,

148
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:54,132
isn't it worth it?

149
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:55,945
And how are we supposed
to trust each other

150
00:04:56,031 --> 00:04:57,040
if our fellow officers
are trying

151
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,789
to trick us
into screwing up?

152
00:04:59,055 --> 00:05:01,566
I... ask myself that
every day.

153
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:03,307
That's different.

154
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:04,883
I do it
to make you a better cop,

155
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,241
not betray you.

156
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:28,838
You're, uh...

157
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:30,719

00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:54,799
It's just that I'm
really late right now,

00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:56,339
and I got a lot of people
waiting for me on set.

00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:02,843
There's no harm done.

175
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,548
You know,
I could get you tickets

176
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:06,299
to any big movie premiere
you'd like,

177
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:07,879
or is there a particular star
you ever wanted to meet?

178
00:06:07,964 --> 00:06:10,219
Okay, sir,
bribery of a public officer

179
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:11,976
is in violation of co...

180
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:15,745
What?

181
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,870
Oh, you gotta be
kidding me.

182
00:06:20,925 --> 00:06:22,050
Murphy.

183
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:23,557
Officer Bradford.

184
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:25,338
Nice touch,
roping in a celebrity.

185
00:06:25,464 --> 00:06:27,379
Well, he had community service
hours to work off.

186
00:06:27,464 --> 00:06:29,049
You thought we'd let him go
'cause he's famous?

187
00:06:29,134 --> 00:06:30,419
Had I known it was you,

188
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:32,638
I would've put a strung-out cop
behind the wheel.

189
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:34,894
I know you have
a soft spot.

190
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:40,823
Hey, excuse me,
does that mean I can go?

191
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:43,204
Write him up.
Reckless driving.

192
00:06:43,305 --> 00:06:45,190
Giving false information
to a police officer.

193
00:06:45,276 --> 00:06:46,932
Disobedience
to traffic signs.

194
00:06:47,054 --> 00:06:49,034
Unlawful act
with a green air sticker.

195
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,705
Driving with
an obstructed view.

196
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:52,461
Unnecessary use of horn.

197
00:06:52,547 --> 00:06:55,073
Failure to exercise caution
when passing animals.

198
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:56,303
Wha...

199
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,870
Is he serious?!

200
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,768
What if she's
one of the reversals?

201
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:04,009
It's not your fault
her tacky dress broke

202
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:05,893
when she tried
to stab a guy.

203
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:07,314
If she's IA,
she'll report

204
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,855
you used reasonable force
given the threat.

205
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:12,629
You think it's possible
that the dress was designed

206
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:14,419
to fail on contact?

207
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:15,759
You know, like...

208
00:07:15,844 --> 00:07:17,580
those break-away pants?

209
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,574
I'm gonna go finish
the paperwork.

210
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,062
Thanks, you guys.

211
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:27,643
Right this way.

212
00:07:27,766 --> 00:07:30,891
Please, believe me, I did not
mean to expose you like that.

213
00:07:31,093 --> 00:07:32,218
Um...

214
00:07:32,445 --> 00:07:33,480
The woman with the phone,

215
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:34,715
I spoke to her.
She was very reasonable.

216
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,950
I watched her delete
all the footage.

217
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:37,570
You have no idea
who I am, do you?

218
00:07:37,714 --> 00:07:39,379
Uh, you are
Astrid Heisserer.

219
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:40,509
Uh...

220
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:42,402
No priors,
no outstanding warrants.

221
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:45,089
What's your name?
John Nolan.

222
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:46,972
Badge number.
25253.

223
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:48,801
If you want to lodge
a complaint, that is your right.

224
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:51,931
Oh, I'm gonna lodge
something... believe me.

225
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,121
Yo, that's messed up.

226
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:59,574
You went through
Wesley's phone?

227
00:07:59,674 --> 00:08:00,969
I thought he was
cheating on me.

228
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:02,847
Cheating? You guys
only went on a few dates.

229
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,348
I knew you wouldn't
understand.

230
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:06,691
Oh, I understand,
I just don't approve.

231
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:09,808
And I understand that's not
the tone to take with a T.O.,

232
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:11,574
- so I take it back.
- Good.

233
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,167
Except the
"that's messed up" part.

234
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,409
That, I stand by.

235
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:17,042
Whoa.

236
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:18,629
How much you wanna bet
it's a reversal?

237
00:08:18,714 --> 00:08:20,234
That's pretty convincing
drunk-driving.

238
00:08:21,118 --> 00:08:22,413
$20 it's legit.

239
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:24,832
Driver, pull over now.

240
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:38,910
Unless IA's recruiting
out of grade school,

241
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,097
I just made 20 bucks.

242
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:42,743
Are you okay?

243
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:44,257
Good. Get out.

244
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:45,378
I can't.

245
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:46,969
I have to get her
to the hospital.

246
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:48,764
She's dying.
Lopez.

247
00:08:49,366 --> 00:08:52,246
My sister OD'd.
Please... help her!

248
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:59,636
- She's barely breathing.
- Control, start RA to our location.

249
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:01,222
Female, 20s, overdose.

250
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,839
- Do you know what she took?
- No. I'm sorry.

251
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:04,089
- Pupils are pin points.
- It's okay.

252
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:05,910
It's probably heroin.
Get the NARCAN.

253
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:14,620
Come on, stay with us.

254
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:16,842
Here you go.
All right, step back.

255
00:09:16,935 --> 00:09:18,300
She's gonna be okay.

256
00:09:18,386 --> 00:09:20,181
This stuff will
wake her right up, all right?

257
00:09:20,531 --> 00:09:22,455
It'll wake her right up.

258
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,557
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

259
00:09:24,643 --> 00:09:25,745
Come on.

260
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:27,746
Come on.

261
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:31,045
You got her help.
You saved her.

262
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:32,666
It's all right,
just breathe.

263
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:38,159
<i>7-Adam-19,
459 in progress, 117 Ayers.</i>

264
00:09:38,324 --> 00:09:40,119
Police!
We're coming in!

265
00:09:42,004 --> 00:09:45,674
<i>♪ Mother, I lie ♪</i>

266
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,687
<i>♪ When I say I don't miss home ♪</i>

267
00:09:48,804 --> 00:09:49,919
Mushrooms?

268
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:51,299
Hallucinogens.

269
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:53,049
This is a grow house.

270
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,379
Careful... these places
are usually booby trapped.

271
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:02,455
Oh, my God.

272
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:04,502
See? Booby trapped.

273
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,393
Please, just get this thing
off of me.

274
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:09,174
I-I don't think we should.
He could've severed an artery.

275
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,519
The paramedics
will know what to do.

276
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:12,386
No, no, no. We don't need
to call anybody else.

277
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:14,547
There's like half a million
dollars' worth of mushrooms in here.

278
00:10:14,632 --> 00:10:17,047
We split it, you pretend
you never saw me...

279
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:20,024
everybody wins.

280
00:10:20,384 --> 00:10:21,627
Okay.

281
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:23,066
- What?!
- Really?

282
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,495
Yeah.
But I want 60%.

283
00:10:25,642 --> 00:10:27,151
So, call Detective Murphy

284
00:10:27,264 --> 00:10:29,401
and ask her if that's okay
with Internal Affairs.

285
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:30,502
Who?

286
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,081
Wait, you think this
is another reversal?

287
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,629
- Two in two hours?
- That's how they do it.

288
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:35,019
They try and catch you
when your guard is down.

289
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:36,259
What are you talking about?

290
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,339
Look, I've got to say,
this is impressive FX work.

291
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:41,009
But we are in Hollywood,
so, how'd you do it? Hmm?

292
00:10:41,094 --> 00:10:42,909
Metal plates?
Peg leg?

293
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,339
Wait. Wait. What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

294
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:46,469
Calling your bluff.

295
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,885
<i>7-Adam-19, we need an RA
to 117 Ayers.</i>

296
00:10:53,073 --> 00:10:56,026
30-year-old male,
severe trauma to left leg.

297
00:10:58,298 --> 00:10:59,798
You're lucky
his leg's gonna be okay.

298
00:10:59,884 --> 00:11:01,259
If Murphy hadn't
gotten in my head,

299
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,339
that never
would've happened.

300
00:11:02,424 --> 00:11:03,948
Blame the reversals,
not me.

301
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:05,548
What happened
between you two?

302
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:07,089
Did she investigate you
or something?

303
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:08,495
Indirectly.

304
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:12,912
Is it Isabel?

305
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,205
Look, Murphy was
her investigating officer.

306
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,088
Okay,
but you're not Isabel,

307
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:20,745
- so what's her beef with you?
- Not your concern.

308
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,510
Start the paperwork.

309
00:11:24,853 --> 00:11:26,398
- Everything okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

310
00:11:26,484 --> 00:11:28,315
Um, we had a reversal,

311
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,136
but Officer Bradford saw right
through it, so...

312
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:33,034
I heard. IA is stepping up their game
using celebrities. Yeah.

313
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,698
- Stay vigilant.
- Mm.

314
00:11:34,784 --> 00:11:36,979
I wanted to say
I really appreciated

315
00:11:37,065 --> 00:11:38,565
what you said
earlier today...

316
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:40,969
about cops doing
the right thing every day.

317
00:11:41,054 --> 00:11:42,214
Is that because
you're seeing evidence

318
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,969
of officers
acting otherwise?

319
00:11:44,054 --> 00:11:46,221
No. Not at all.
I-I was just...

320
00:11:46,307 --> 00:11:47,379
Relax, Officer Chen.

321
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:49,205
I'm not gonna ask you
to narc on anyone.

322
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,369
But part of
protecting and serving

323
00:11:51,455 --> 00:11:53,955
is making sure you refuse to do
anything that crosses a line.

324
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:55,919
So if anybody
is asking you to do so,

325
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:57,995
- I expect you to come talk to me.
- Yes, ma'am.

326
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:00,246
Okay. Tell me, how's that
new apartment working out?

327
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:03,468
Oh. Uh, it's great.
It's in a quiet neighborhood.

328
00:12:03,554 --> 00:12:06,612
There's lots of coffee shops,
and people walking around.

329
00:12:10,994 --> 00:12:12,572
Comics?

330
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:14,347
Yeah. Uh...

331
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:16,550
I found it
in the lost and found.

332
00:12:16,714 --> 00:12:19,025
And by lost and found,
I mean my locker.

333
00:12:19,384 --> 00:12:20,564
Thanks.

334
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:22,173
Yeah.

335
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:25,541
So, what happens now?

336
00:12:25,627 --> 00:12:28,542
I... Your sister,
she's... she's stable.

337
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:31,382
Uh, no reason that she can't
make a full recovery.

338
00:12:31,554 --> 00:12:33,142
Then it's up to her.

339
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:35,228
But ODs have a way of, um,

340
00:12:35,314 --> 00:12:37,431
putting things
into perspective.

341
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:40,556
My mom OD'd three times
before she died.

342
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:43,634
Each time, she swore
she was gonna get clean.

343
00:12:44,704 --> 00:12:47,789
Cassie and I found her when
we went down for breakfast.

344
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:49,306
She was blue.

345
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:50,619
Yeah.

346
00:12:50,705 --> 00:12:51,822
You can't lose hope.

347
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:53,986
Yeah.
That's what everyone says.

348
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:55,626
'Cause it's true, Jake.

349
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:59,681
Social Services is on their way
to get you placed somewhere safe

350
00:12:59,767 --> 00:13:01,494
while your sister
gets the help she needs.

351
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,705
Okay?

352
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:04,259
Sure.

353
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:09,603
I'll be right back.

354
00:13:10,187 --> 00:13:12,658
Hey. Hold up.
Can we talk?

355
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,619
Okay.

356
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,494
I need
to explain something.

357
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,150
My dad left
when I was a kid.

358
00:13:23,264 --> 00:13:25,509
And my mom never really
got past it.

359
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:27,969
There was no one stable
growing up in my life,

360
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:30,339
so I guess
what I'm trying to say

361
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:32,839
is I think that's
the reason why I-I...

362
00:13:32,924 --> 00:13:34,501
I went through your phone.

363
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,487
- You sound like my clients.
- What?

364
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:39,798
Everybody's dad bailed.

365
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:41,424
No one's mom
was perfect.

366
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,228
Doesn't change
what you did.

367
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:45,533
No, I know, but...

368
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:46,719
You're a grown woman,

369
00:13:46,804 --> 00:13:49,884
so having a bad childhood
isn't a valid excuse anymore.

370
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:53,939
Look, I wish I could
trust you again, but...

371
00:13:54,764 --> 00:13:56,384
I don't see how I can.

372
00:13:58,217 --> 00:13:59,717
I'm sorry.

373
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:09,607
Tim was so convinced
we caught another reversal,

374
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:11,564
he pried open
the bear trap.

375
00:14:11,736 --> 00:14:14,018
I've never seen someone actually
pass out from pain before.

376
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,923
That's tough.
Not as bad as the helplessness

377
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:17,658
in that kid's eyes.

378
00:14:19,214 --> 00:14:21,129
What about you?
Good day? Bad day?

379
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:24,879
I had to pry a psycho off
a valet at a five-star hotel.

380
00:14:25,111 --> 00:14:27,906
Uh, her dress ripped
as I was cuffing her,

381
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,298
exposing
her unmentionables.

382
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:30,439
Boy, she was pissed.

383
00:14:30,525 --> 00:14:32,244
- Wow.
- What?

384
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,150
That was for sure
a reversal.

385
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:36,165
Yeah, dress
was probably rigged...

386
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,509
- like break-away pants.
- Mmhmm.

387
00:14:37,594 --> 00:14:39,179
- That's what I thought!
- Yeah?

388
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:40,379
Oh.

389
00:14:40,464 --> 00:14:41,879
Okay,
I see what you're doing.

390
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,009
Can I get that to go,
please?

391
00:14:43,094 --> 00:14:44,509
No, come on!
Don't be like that.

392
00:14:44,594 --> 00:14:46,978
No, as much as I would love
to keep telling war stories...

393
00:14:47,064 --> 00:14:47,923
Thank you, Dez...

394
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:50,049
I have another full day
of reversals tomorrow,

395
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:52,306
and this rookie
needs his beauty sleep.

396
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:44,406
Hey.

397
00:15:44,594 --> 00:15:46,509
So, they canvassed the area.
No one saw the shooter.

398
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:47,870
He fired
a couple hundred rounds.

399
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:49,549
Yeah, no one's admitting
they saw him.

400
00:15:49,634 --> 00:15:51,299
Yeah, patrol found
the car he escaped in.

401
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,915
It was reported stolen
this afternoon.

402
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,076
- SID is all over it.
- Who'd you piss off?

403
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,788
Clearly someone with access
to heavy weaponry.

404
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,244
I didn't recognize
the guy.

405
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,901
According to intelligence,
you've been greenlit

406
00:15:59,986 --> 00:16:01,025
by Southern Front.

407
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:02,879
- Greenlit?
- Means they put a hit on you.

408
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:04,839
How's a rookie
get greenlit before me?

409
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:07,134
I gotta step up my game.
It's not a badge of honor.

410
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,682
Violent white supremacist gang wants
you dead, you're doing something right.

411
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:11,969
I-I'm sorry, white supremacy
gang and greenlit?

412
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,346
W-Wh... What the hell
is going on?

413
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,884
Normally, gangs
don't target cops...

414
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,219
more trouble
than it's worth.

415
00:16:16,304 --> 00:16:18,751
Unless a cop
disrespects a gang member,

416
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:19,892
then all bets are off.

417
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:22,533
You arrested a woman today.
Astrid Heisserer.

418
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:25,878
Her dress broke.
I-I embarrassed her.

419
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:27,275
I thought she was IA.

420
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,986
She's not. She's the baby mama
of the leader of Southern Front,

421
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:32,799
one of the most violent criminal
enterprises in the country.

422
00:16:32,884 --> 00:16:34,219
And because of how
you treated her,

423
00:16:34,304 --> 00:16:36,589
he authorized everyone
in the gang to kill you.

424
00:16:36,674 --> 00:16:38,814
- What about Talia?
- Yeah, what about me?

425
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,415
Nolan is the one
who put hands on her.

426
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,549
He's the one
they're after.

427
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,361
How many Southern Front
members are there?

428
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:46,298
In the greater Los Angeles area?
Several thousand.

429
00:16:46,384 --> 00:16:48,478
And protecting you will be
our number-one priority.

430
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,447
Step one is to get you
off the streets.

431
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,720
Come with me, Nolan.
I'm gonna escort you home.

432
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:02,639
K9 unit already swept
the property.

433
00:17:03,054 --> 00:17:04,139
Owner
coming home tonight?

434
00:17:04,225 --> 00:17:06,913
Uh, no, Ben left
for New York yesterday.

435
00:17:06,999 --> 00:17:08,509
So, what's happening
here?

436
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:10,803
The DA approved
a VARDA alarm.

437
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:12,373
It bypasses 911,

438
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:14,592
sends a red alert
to all the cops in the area.

439
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,076
So, what's next?

440
00:17:16,214 --> 00:17:17,248
That's up to you.

441
00:17:17,334 --> 00:17:18,967
I mean, I can't just
go to work, right?

442
00:17:19,053 --> 00:17:21,299
I'd be endangering everyone who
came within five feet of me.

443
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:22,969
Being a cop
is being at risk.

444
00:17:23,054 --> 00:17:24,568
So you're saying
I should just...

445
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:26,701
report for duty,
act like nothing happened?

446
00:17:26,787 --> 00:17:29,326
I think we tell criminals what
to do, not the other way around.

447
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:31,732
- No matter the consequences?
- No matter the consequences.

448
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:34,129
But, look,
it's up to you.

449
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:35,719
No one is gonna judge you
either way.

450
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,867
Yeah, right.

451
00:17:36,953 --> 00:17:38,051
Nolan.

452
00:17:39,004 --> 00:17:40,639
This isn't about bravery.

453
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:42,146
You have a family.

454
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:44,974
Any cop who's ever worn a badge
understands that.

455
00:17:45,473 --> 00:17:46,834
<i>All set, Captain.</i>

456
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:48,061
Okay.

457
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:50,115
It seems the system
is up and armed.

458
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:51,446
We have a unit
parked out front.

459
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:52,777
Try to get some sleep.

460
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,779
Don't see that happening.

461
00:17:55,091 --> 00:17:56,134
No.

462
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:58,391
- Thank you.
- Have a good night.

463
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:01,474
Hey.
What are you doing here?

464
00:18:01,565 --> 00:18:03,070
Guard duty.

465
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,802
I think we have that covered.

466
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:06,763
Now
it's extra covered.

467
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:09,129
You call me directly
if anything happens.

468
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:10,299
Yes, ma'am.

469
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:11,533
Okay.

470
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,845
West and Chen
reporting for duty.

471
00:18:17,102 --> 00:18:21,115
Guys, this is very sweet,
but honestly, it's unnecessary.

472
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,809
You'd do the same
for us.

473
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:25,232
So, how do you
want to do this?

474
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:27,419
Personally, I'd go with
alternating two-hour shifts

475
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:29,717
with a static position
plus a rover.

476
00:18:29,803 --> 00:18:32,943
Oh, and I have earpieces
and walkies,

477
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,912
just so we can keep
in constant contact.

478
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:36,259
You got anything sweet?

479
00:18:36,344 --> 00:18:37,629
Yeah, I think
there's some ice cream.

480
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:39,469
- Mm.
- Wait, guys.

481
00:18:39,554 --> 00:18:40,701
Guys!

482
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,834
Look, come on.
We need to stay focused.

483
00:18:43,564 --> 00:18:45,189
You know, the whole point
of guard duty

484
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:47,650
is that we take turns being up
so everyone gets some sleep.

485
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:49,092
You could've left
at any time.

486
00:18:49,178 --> 00:18:50,969
Yep. No one would've
given you grief.

487
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:52,089
Yeah, right.

488
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,209
- Ohh.
- We got to get to the station.

489
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:55,839
Our shift starts soon.

490
00:18:55,998 --> 00:18:58,009
- I should go in.
- What... To work?

491
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,259
Absolutely not.

492
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:01,123
You're safest right here.

493
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:03,007
We'll manage without you
for a few weeks at work.

494
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:04,194
What if it's longer
than that?

495
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,701
My training
would be put on hold,

496
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:09,185
I'd... stay a rookie
while you guys moved up.

497
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,068
We'd be separated.

498
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:14,764
That's never
gonna happen.

499
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,967
This, uh...
This will all be over soon.

500
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:18,072
Yeah.

501
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,943
And if it's not?

502
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,574
Then it's...

503
00:19:21,844 --> 00:19:23,607
good you have a pool.

504
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:32,748
All right.
Everyone, settle down.

505
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:34,521
Captain.
Thank you for coming in...

506
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:35,969
most of you on your day off.

507
00:19:36,054 --> 00:19:37,084
Till this is resolved,

508
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,420
all overtime limits
have been lifted.

509
00:19:39,802 --> 00:19:41,542
As you may know,

510
00:19:41,628 --> 00:19:45,048
Southern Front originated as
a white supremacist prison gang

511
00:19:45,134 --> 00:19:46,396
about 15 years ago.

512
00:19:46,482 --> 00:19:48,623
Since then, they have
branched out in a big way.

513
00:19:48,714 --> 00:19:50,839
Drugs, prostitution,
extortion.

514
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,443
But what sets them apart

515
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:54,219
is their access
to military weapons.

516
00:19:54,304 --> 00:19:57,179
Their leader,
the so-called "King Midas,"

517
00:19:57,264 --> 00:20:00,799
is currently serving three
consecutive life sentences.

518
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:02,068
His son, Cole,

519
00:20:02,154 --> 00:20:04,365
he controls the day-to-day
operations on the street.

520
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:07,339
But make no mistake, his father
is pulling the strings.

521
00:20:07,424 --> 00:20:10,469
Lifting the greenlight would be
a huge loss of face for Cole,

522
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:11,905
so he's not gonna do it
willingly.

523
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,629
So, we gotta make this
a business decision.

524
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,719
We put a big enough hurt
on their operation,

525
00:20:15,804 --> 00:20:17,504
they'll lift
the greenlight.

526
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:23,299
Sorry I'm late.

527
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:52,743
Yesterday, Southern Front
tried to kill one of our own.

528
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:55,735
Today, we hit back.

529
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,126
- What?
- Nothing.

530
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,172
Look, everyone else sees
this big hero move,

531
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:09,891
but I see your ego
getting in the way

532
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,516
of you doing
the smart thing.

533
00:21:11,664 --> 00:21:13,258
Look.

534
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:14,968
If you don't want
to ride with me...

535
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:16,719
It's not about my safety.

536
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:18,090
It's about yours.

537
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:20,118
You're risking your life
to prove a point.

538
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:21,665
Seems worth it
to me...

539
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:23,466
if you're making
the right point.

540
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,539
But there's no sense
in taking a needless risk,

541
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,554
which is why Officer Nolan
will be staying far away

542
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:29,594
from anything
Southern Front related.

543
00:21:29,951 --> 00:21:31,485
And I'll be riding
with him.

544
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:34,533
Whether I agree
with his decision or not,

545
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:35,704
he's my rookie.

546
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,290
And I'll take
good care of him.

547
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:40,438
Yes, ma'am.

548
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,254
Riding
with the captain.

549
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:47,425
And I thought being greenlit
was scary.

550
00:21:47,511 --> 00:21:48,556
I drive.

551
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,097
Of course.

552
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,558
Officer Nolan.

553
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,304
- Keys.
- Yes.

554
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:57,743
How exactly are we hurting
Midas' operation?

555
00:21:57,829 --> 00:21:59,299
By attacking Southern Front
where they make

556
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:01,797
all their money...
the three Ts.

557
00:22:02,214 --> 00:22:04,179
Drug trafficking.

558
00:22:07,844 --> 00:22:09,422
Weapons trafficking.

559
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:12,735
And sex trafficking.

560
00:22:12,991 --> 00:22:14,566

00:22:14,714 --> 00:22:15,839

I'll handle processing.

569
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:29,629
You get started
on the asset paperwork.

570
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:31,799
I still don't see how
confiscating 20 gallons of lube

571
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,419
is gonna get the gang
to back off Nolan.

572
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:35,839
Asset forfeiture is where we do
the most damage today.

573
00:22:35,924 --> 00:22:37,549
Law says we can seize
everything and anything

574
00:22:37,634 --> 00:22:39,339
connected to their
illegal operation.

575
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,839
Vehicles, merchandise,
even the massage parlor.

576
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:44,024
Well, so, why didn't
we hit it last week?

577
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:45,712
Vice knew that
Southern Front owned that shop.

578
00:22:45,797 --> 00:22:46,680
'Cause
it's whack-a-mole.

579
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,879
You take out one
criminal enterprise,

580
00:22:47,964 --> 00:22:49,129
another one
takes its place.

581
00:22:49,214 --> 00:22:50,629
Usually not a good use
of our time.

582
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:51,969
But today,
that's exactly what we want.

583
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:54,049
Make sure Southern Front's
scared one of their competitors

584
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:56,379
- is about to move in, a...
- Move! Don't touch me, man! Come on!

585
00:22:56,464 --> 00:22:58,094
You gotta be kidding me.

586
00:22:59,521 --> 00:23:00,875
What the hell
are you doing here?

587
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:02,836
My job. Making sure cops
don't break the law.

588
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:04,281
One of our officers
was greenlit.

589
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:05,547
Came within seconds
of being killed.

590
00:23:05,632 --> 00:23:07,672
When do you think that a cop's
most likely to cross a line?

591
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:09,554
When they're scared,
angry, and want revenge.

592
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:12,140
They might... I don't know...
yell at a detective.

593
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:14,811
How about I write you up for
conduct unbecoming an officer?

594
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:16,062
Knock yourself out.

595
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:17,642
This is about Isabel,
and you know it.

596
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:18,890
You know,
it is about Isabel.

597
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:21,343
It's about the fact that
you covered for her for months.

598
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:22,718
- That's not true.
- Oh, please.

599
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,839
Any cop can tell an addict
10 miles out.

600
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:26,090
You knew she was using,

601
00:23:26,176 --> 00:23:27,985
and you let her come to work
every day with a loaded gun.

602
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,261
You had an obligation
to report her, and you didn't.

603
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:31,362
Okay, that's a lie.

604
00:23:31,448 --> 00:23:33,074
But I'd expect nothing less
from a cop like you.

605
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:35,075
Uh, hey, I need you
to come check something for me.

606
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,278
I want to make sure I'm doing it
by the book, okay? So, come on.

607
00:23:37,363 --> 00:23:38,778
Hey, you know what?
If I were you,

608
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:40,160
I'd ask
for another T.O.

609
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:41,701
Yeah, well,
you're not me.

610
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,322
Ma'am.

611
00:23:52,086 --> 00:23:54,324
I was told
there was a cop coming

612
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:56,746
with the authority
to negotiate.

613
00:23:56,942 --> 00:23:58,375
Cut the crap.

614
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:00,101
Only color you care about
is green.

615
00:24:00,187 --> 00:24:03,382
And the LAPD has taken
a lot of that from you today.

616
00:24:03,477 --> 00:24:06,515
Now, if you want to stop
the bleeding, sit your ass down.

617
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,062
Look, I reviewed
the body cam footage.

618
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:17,562
That girl tried to stab a guy
right in front of my officer.

619
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:19,472
He used minimal force
to stop her...

620
00:24:19,557 --> 00:24:21,679
no disrespect was intended
or shown.

621
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:23,617
Your son is overreacting,

622
00:24:23,703 --> 00:24:25,421
and I don't think
it's his first time.

623
00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:29,271
It's time for the adults
to de-escalate matters.

624
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:30,901
You been in the game
long?

625
00:24:30,987 --> 00:24:32,049
Almost 20 years.

626
00:24:32,135 --> 00:24:34,729
Then you know I can't just
rescind the greenlight.

627
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,352
It's gotta come from Cole.

628
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:39,932
Any other way,
my guys don't respect him.

629
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:42,752
Yeah.
Sucks to be you.

630
00:24:42,977 --> 00:24:44,312
Let me be clear.

631
00:24:44,397 --> 00:24:45,812
I'm not here to negotiate.

632
00:24:45,948 --> 00:24:48,284
We cost you $1 million
in lost revenue

633
00:24:48,409 --> 00:24:50,416
and three
in seized assets.

634
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,330
And we're just
getting started.

635
00:24:53,136 --> 00:24:55,421
None of that matters
without honor.

636
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,915
You're way out
on a ledge, Midas.

637
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:02,260
In half a day, we shut down
seven of your businesses,

638
00:25:02,346 --> 00:25:04,522
put 46 of your men
behind bars,

639
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:09,022
and just imagine the damage
we can do tomorrow,

640
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,852
when we start hitting
your spots in San Diego,

641
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:13,232
San Jose, Victorville.

642
00:25:13,317 --> 00:25:14,472
I can keep going.

643
00:25:14,557 --> 00:25:18,299
Your son... is about to destroy
everything you built

644
00:25:18,385 --> 00:25:20,472
because his girlfriend
yelled at him.

645
00:25:20,557 --> 00:25:23,776
Do the right thing...
call off the greenlight.

646
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:27,791
<i>7-Adam-15,
possible 459 in progress,</i>

647
00:25:27,877 --> 00:25:29,604
<i>1936 Kristol Lane.</i>

648
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,830
7-Adam-15,
show us responding.

649
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,651
I hate this.

650
00:25:33,751 --> 00:25:35,807
Feels like everyone's
fighting my battle for me.

651
00:25:36,073 --> 00:25:37,817
City still needs
policing.

652
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,232
Ah, that was...

653
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:17,325
Exhilarating.

654
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:19,161
I was gonna say
"terrifying."

655
00:26:21,107 --> 00:26:23,062
Guess I better
get used to that.

656
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:26,114
You know, when I, uh... I was
first stationed in Baghdad,

657
00:26:26,286 --> 00:26:28,169
I used to get
these headaches.

658
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:30,646
Took me a few days to realize
it was 'cause my eyes

659
00:26:30,731 --> 00:26:32,602
kept darting around,
looking for trouble.

660
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:33,812
That's what it is.

661
00:26:33,897 --> 00:26:36,567
I didn't stop looking,
but it does stop hurting.

662
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,142
<i>7-Adam-15, go to
channel 2 for Sergeant Grey.</i>

663
00:26:40,227 --> 00:26:41,832
Copy.

664
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:43,926
Andersen.

665
00:26:44,012 --> 00:26:45,102
<i>It worked.</i>

666
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:47,473
<i>Midas forced Cole
to lift the greenlight.</i>

667
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:53,309
I guess you are back to being
just another rookie.

668
00:26:53,477 --> 00:26:55,392
Thank God.

669
00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:56,732
Thank you, Sergeant.

670
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:58,102
<i>My pleasure.</i>

671
00:26:58,387 --> 00:26:59,382
So, does that mean

672
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:01,682
this little "Odd Couple"
partnership is over?

673
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:02,812
Hell no!

674
00:27:02,897 --> 00:27:04,914
We got a burglary call
to take.

675
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,593
7-Adam-15, show us Code 6
on the burglary call.

676
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,472
Be advised,
we have an open door.

677
00:27:12,562 --> 00:27:14,007
Going in to clear.

678
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,595
Nolan! Cover...

679
00:28:00,882 --> 00:28:02,618
Hey, there!

680
00:28:23,187 --> 00:28:24,678
Look who's awake.

681
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,585
Packs quite a kick,
doesn't it?

682
00:28:29,897 --> 00:28:33,506
It's got four times the voltage
as LAPD uses.

683
00:28:34,497 --> 00:28:38,694
Could probably cook the eyeball
right out of your skull.

684
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,937
Okay, look, look,
I did not intend

685
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:41,022
to disrespect Astrid,
okay?

686
00:28:41,107 --> 00:28:42,022
Or you, okay?

687
00:28:42,107 --> 00:28:43,538
And I would be happy
to apologize.

688
00:28:43,624 --> 00:28:45,022
Too late for that now.

689
00:28:45,107 --> 00:28:47,772
Only way this ends
is with you dead.

690
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:52,825
Yeah, I, uh...
I'd heard that you were dumb,

691
00:28:53,294 --> 00:28:55,642
but it is shocking
to see it in person.

692
00:28:55,728 --> 00:28:57,317

- Dumb.

Who lured you into an ambush
with a false surrender?

694
00:29:01,857 --> 00:29:03,417
Does your father know
that it was false?

695
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,911
Huh, junior?

696
00:29:05,434 --> 00:29:08,262
I can't imagine that revelation's
gonna go too well, huh?

697
00:29:12,015 --> 00:29:13,770

Oh, he's dumber

What's my rank?

700
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:21,732
- What?
- What is my rank?

701
00:29:21,817 --> 00:29:22,932
Come on, you're the leader

702
00:29:23,017 --> 00:29:25,442
of the sixth-largest gang
in all of California.

703
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:27,602
Surely you can tell
from my uniform what rank I am.

704
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:28,857

707
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:35,844
- No offense.
- None taken.

708
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,348
But two bars?

709
00:29:39,187 --> 00:29:40,262
Oh,
for crying out loud.

710
00:29:40,348 --> 00:29:42,692
And a badge
that says "Captain"?

711
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:46,176
You've just crossed a line
that anybody with half a brain

712
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:47,481
would run screaming from.

713
00:29:47,567 --> 00:29:50,522
A line that even your father
might whack you for crossing.

714
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:52,176
Understood?

715
00:29:52,436 --> 00:29:54,715
So, let me tell you
how this is gonna go.

Hurt me! Right?

719
00:30:01,647 --> 00:30:03,169
I'm the one
you wanna hurt, right?

720
00:30:03,255 --> 00:30:05,879
Killing me, that's trouble
you can handle, okay?

721
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:06,772
But not her.
You need to let her go.

722
00:30:06,857 --> 00:30:08,442
- Do you think I'm dumb, too?
- No.

723
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:10,364
No.

724
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,497
No!

725
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:18,559
No! No!

726
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:19,975
No!

727
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:23,747
If the line's
already been crossed,

728
00:30:23,833 --> 00:30:25,482
then there's
no going back.

729
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:28,646
Which means neither of you
are walking out of here.

As long as your bodies
never turn up,

731
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:33,943
the murder can't be pinned on me.
No, you're wrong.

732
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:35,561
And Southern Front'll
weather the storm.

733
00:30:35,646 --> 00:30:37,208
It's gonna be
so much worse.

734
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,044
You need to get her
out of there now.

735
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:41,234
Hey, listen.
What about this?

736

You'll get laid for weeks.

it'll shrink enough

But trust me, if there's
one thing you can use

00:40:34,397 --> 00:40:36,500
You were right...
that was bush league.

869
00:40:37,155 --> 00:40:38,365
Good.

870
00:40:38,818 --> 00:40:40,047
Wait.

871
00:40:43,512 --> 00:40:45,664
Look, I'm only...
I'm only saying this

872
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,024
because Andersen
would want me to.

873
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:50,586
But you were right, too.

874
00:40:51,238 --> 00:40:54,603
I knew Isabel was using
in the end, and...

875
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:57,790
I didn't say anything because
I was trying to help her.

876
00:40:59,366 --> 00:41:00,906
She was my wife.

877
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:03,547
How's she doing?

878
00:41:05,169 --> 00:41:06,414
Better.

879
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,930
She's clean.

880
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:11,439
I'm glad.

881
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,064
Is everything okay?

882
00:41:19,203 --> 00:41:21,118
Yeah, for now.

883
00:41:21,594 --> 00:41:23,232
All right, back to work.

884
00:41:32,754 --> 00:41:34,180
What?

885
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:37,563
First time I met the captain,
I fell flat on my face.

886
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:39,892
Bishop and Lopez
sent me to her office,

887
00:41:39,977 --> 00:41:42,532
told me I needed to introduce
myself before roll call.

888
00:41:42,618 --> 00:41:45,063
- You got punked.
- That's exactly what she said.

889
00:41:45,517 --> 00:41:46,750
Tried to play it off,

890
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:49,016
but she was
way too smart for that.

891
00:41:49,598 --> 00:41:51,138
Yeah.

892
00:41:53,147 --> 00:41:55,188
She asked for you to be
assigned to Mid-Wilshire.

893
00:41:55,274 --> 00:41:56,329
You know that?

894
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,836
No.

895
00:42:00,187 --> 00:42:01,579
Why?
She didn't even know me.

896
00:42:01,665 --> 00:42:03,344
She felt your experience
would make you

897
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:05,633
a valuable addition
to our house.

898
00:42:08,412 --> 00:42:10,336
Guess I got
a lot to live up to.

899
00:42:12,452 --> 00:42:13,727
We all do.

900
00:42:15,982 --> 00:42:17,517
We all do.

901
