1
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,177
Bank's open, John.

2
00:00:17,012 --> 00:00:18,375
Thanks.

3
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:23,006
So... Happy Divorce Day.

4
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:24,673
- That's not a thing.
- It should be.

5
00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:26,675
When mine went through,
I took the boys to Disneyland.

6
00:00:26,806 --> 00:00:28,237
I'm not really feeling the Matterhorn.

7
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:30,727
Try and look at this as an opportunity.

8
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:32,675
Right now, I'm just trying to
remember to wear pants.

9
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,517
You know, I thought I'd be relieved.

10
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:36,912
Sarah and I agreed to stay together

11
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:38,186
until Henry went to college.

12
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:40,522
I knew this was coming for two years.

13
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:41,691
So

14
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:43,698
what have you always wanted to do?

15
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:47,352
Uh, Chippendales.
Or the NFL... I'm not picky.

16
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,774
I'm trying to help you, John.

17
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:52,858
I bought a self-help book,
but I had the cashier

18
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:55,079
put it in a brown paper bag.
Can't bring myself to open it.

19
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:57,486
Who am I?

20
00:00:57,574 --> 00:00:59,757
I think the healthier question
is "Who do you want to be?"

21
00:01:02,365 --> 00:01:04,498
When I figure it out,
I'll let you know.

22
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:35,915
Everybody on the floor now!

23
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:38,712
Get down! Get down!

24
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:42,480
Who's the bank manager?

25
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:44,572
- Come on. You got to move it, lady.
- Okay.

26
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:45,952
Come on.

27
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:48,552
Fill it. Now, hurry.

28
00:01:48,577 --> 00:01:50,097
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

29
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:51,242
Hey! Get back down now!

30
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:53,337
- Stacy, you okay?
- You want to die?!

31
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:58,170
No. No.

32
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:01,518
Just keep your mouth shut.

33
00:02:01,553 --> 00:02:02,785
Move it.

34
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:05,989
But, honestly...

35
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:09,652
have I e-even really lived?

36
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:12,946
I mean, life is always something
that's happened<i> to</i> me.

37
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:14,970
You know, I-I met a girl,
I fell in love,

38
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:17,253
stick turned blue, so I dropped
out of college and I got a job,

39
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:18,572
but

40
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:19,995
I never really thought about

41
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,419
what could have been, never
pushed myself to be anything.

42
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:23,940
This bank robbery is...

43
00:02:23,975 --> 00:02:25,875
This is the most exciting thing
that's happened to me

44
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,222
in a lot of years. Is...

45
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:29,718
Is that sad, 'cause it s-sounds sad.

46
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:32,508
Ow!

47
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:38,728
If you get up again, I will kill you.

48
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:40,723
You got that?

49
00:02:43,528 --> 00:02:48,211
Hey, listen, not that you're
at any position to judge.

50
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:51,034
I mean... I mean,

51
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:54,784
your life hasn't really turned
out the way you wanted, has it?

52
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,839
Unless you wanted to be bank robbers,

53
00:02:56,908 --> 00:02:58,270
in which case
- you're living the dream.

54
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:01,311
I... I'm just saying...

55
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:04,742
what's my dream?

56
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,163
Police! Drop the gun!

57
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,864
Drop that weapon! On the floor!

58
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,623
- Drop the gun!
- On the floor!

59
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:15,676
- Hands behind your back. You're okay.
- Get down. Get down.

60
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,328
You...

61
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:19,911
were really just...

62
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,221
Stupid?

63
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,831
Brave.

64
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,182
Hey, Mama.

65
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,290
- That's a nice ride.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:04,315 --> 00:04:05,417
I think I'm gonna have to

67
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:06,785
take it off your hands.

68
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:10,508
Y-You're gonna steal my car...

69
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:12,683
the one that broke down two blocks ago?

70
00:04:12,748 --> 00:04:14,050
Yeah.

71
00:04:14,148 --> 00:04:16,415
Maybe take you for a spin, too.

72
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,684
Officer Chen reporting for duty.

73
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,270
I love Rookie Day.

74
00:04:28,988 --> 00:04:31,267
It's Christmas and "The Purge" in one.

75
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:33,163
And there's my first present.

76
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:34,542
Morning, Boot.

77
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,392
- Good morning, sir...
- Did I say you could talk?

78
00:04:36,426 --> 00:04:38,260
You better pray I'm not your
training officer, Boot,

79
00:04:38,285 --> 00:04:40,652
'cause I'll make your life
a living hell.

80
00:04:41,408 --> 00:04:43,875
Sir, I'd be thrilled
to have you as a T.O.

81
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:46,832
My father raised me to push myself
to the edge of my abilities,

82
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:48,069
- and he'd be deeply disappointed

83
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:50,205
if I failed to do so now that
I've joined him in service.

84
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:54,675
Your father is...

85
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,246
Commander West of Internal
Affairs, yes, sir.

86
00:04:59,492 --> 00:05:01,015
Roll call in 10.

87
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:03,362
You really gonna do me like that?

88
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,521
Hey, the detective position's
not yours yet.

89
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,447
And youngest T.O. to youngest detective

90
00:05:07,472 --> 00:05:09,452
will move me up the ladder nicely.

91
00:05:09,638 --> 00:05:11,330
But if you can't stand
a little competition...

92
00:05:11,355 --> 00:05:13,683
Please, I grew up with four
brothers in a two-bedroom.

93
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,966
I'll be standing at the finish
line before you even realize

94
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:17,290
the competition's started.

95
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:19,475
Where you going, Boot?

96
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:21,481
Uh, locker room, then roll call?

97
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,618
Oh, no. You need to present
yourself to the Captain first.

98
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,518
It's tradition.
Down the hall, up the stairs.

99
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:26,785
Uh, yeah. Thank you.

100
00:05:34,426 --> 00:05:35,515
Can I help you?

101
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,218
Office John Nolan reporting for duty?

102
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:42,462
Did you get punked, Officer Nolan?

103
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:45,425
- No, ma'am. I just...
- Mm-hmm.

104
00:05:45,734 --> 00:05:48,022
Your file confuses me, Officer Nolan.

105
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,434
Penn State. Pre-law. But then
20 years in construction.

106
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:53,434
Well, you got solid marks
at the Academy.

107
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:55,722
You certainly have a work ethic.

108
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:58,206
Cholesterol level I've never
seen in a rookie.

109
00:05:58,273 --> 00:05:59,906
I'm something of a pioneer.

110
00:06:03,195 --> 00:06:04,610
Do you think this is a joke?

111
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:05,983
No, ma'am.

112
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,814
I'm here to work, and
I won't let you down.

113
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,949
We'll see.

114
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:12,697
Roll call is in five minutes,

115
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:15,472
and the watch commander is a stickler.

116
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:18,925
Officer Nolan.

117
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:20,453
I'd run.

118
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,000
All right, all right.

119
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:31,181
Settle down.

120
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:32,972
Settle down.

121
00:06:34,588 --> 00:06:36,421
So, okay, we got some new blood
this morning.

122
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:40,179
And some pushing the expiration date.

123
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:43,591
Get up.

124
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,696
After six months together
in the Academy,

125
00:06:46,836 --> 00:06:48,249
you've earned the right to be here.

126
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,708
But you'll have to prove
yourself to stay.

127
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:53,492
The way we do things matters.

128
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:56,028
Protocol and tradition are the metal

129
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:58,331
from which every cop
in this city is forged.

130
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:00,645
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

131
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:02,247
Sit down.

132
00:07:03,227 --> 00:07:05,438
It's time to play the
Training Officer match game.

133
00:07:06,028 --> 00:07:07,763
Our contestants are...

134
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:10,955
Lucy Chen, a hotshot
who made her first arrest

135
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,535
before clocking in for work.

136
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:14,725
Legacy Jackson West,

137
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,185
who broke all his dad's records
at the Academy.

138
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,152
And John Nolan,
who was born before disco died.

139
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:23,105
And the winners are...

140
00:07:23,163 --> 00:07:26,686
Officer Bradford, you get our hotshot.

141
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,862
Officer Lopez, you get our legacy.

142
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:34,268
Leaving Officer Bishop to ride
with the 40-year-old rookie.

143
00:07:35,182 --> 00:07:37,553
Now, hear me. Today is your first day.

144
00:07:37,578 --> 00:07:39,237
Don't let it be your last.

145
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:42,574
Forget the Academy
and listen to your T.O.s.

146
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:45,010
They'll teach you the way
it should be done.

147
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,645
That's it.

148
00:07:46,856 --> 00:07:49,166
All right. Be safe out there.

149
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:51,549
Officer Bishop, I need a word
with your rook.

150
00:07:51,697 --> 00:07:52,848
Yes, sir.

151
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:59,557
Enjoying your little adventure so far?

152
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,829
- Oh. Yes, sir.
- I don't care.

153
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:05,202
I don't like you, Officer Nolan.
It's not personal.

154
00:08:05,398 --> 00:08:09,534
I hate what you represent...
a walking mid-life crisis.

155
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:13,913
You see, the LAPD isn't a place
for you to "find yourself."

156
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:16,645
And I believe if you succeed,

157
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:19,033
my house will be flooded
with middle-aged losers

158
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:22,837
looking for some kind of "Eat,
Pray, Love" path to reinvention.

159
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,482
And that will get my people killed.

160
00:08:26,938 --> 00:08:28,920
- Sergeant, with respect...
- You're dismissed.

161
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:33,294
What did the watch commander want?

162
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:34,691
To wish me luck.

163
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,294
Boot, this relationship
is gonna get off to a bad start

164
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:38,628
if you lie to me.

165
00:08:38,835 --> 00:08:40,280
Sergeant Grey does not
appear to be a fan

166
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:41,700
of my presence in this department.

167
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,300
'Cause you're old as hell?

168
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,897
Look, I don't give a damn
about your age, Officer Nolan.

169
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:47,548
I want to know if you're
gonna be a speed bump

170
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:48,943
on my path to chief of police.

171
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:50,024
No, ma'am.

172
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:52,483
Six months ago, I packed
everything I own into a U-Haul,

173
00:08:52,508 --> 00:08:54,341
moved here to become a cop.

174
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:57,618
I got to work twice as fast,
three times as hard.

175
00:08:57,656 --> 00:08:59,289
So I'm gonna make you look good.

176
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:01,233
Bit of an over-sharer, huh?

177
00:09:01,312 --> 00:09:03,601
I'm told partners are supposed
to have a special bond.

178
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:05,063
We're not partners.

179
00:09:05,114 --> 00:09:07,839
This is your shop. Do not call
it a car. It is where you work.

180
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,370
First you check the exterior
for damage.

181
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:11,134
Any nicks, scrapes, or dents...
log 'em in.

182
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,824
- Has the suspect left anything?
- Money?

183
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:13,823
- Drugs?
- A dookie?

184
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:15,336
Why aren't you taking
notes, Officer Chen?

185
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,472
You think I'm impressed
because you picked some

186
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:17,792
low-hanging fruit on your way to work?

187
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:19,142
Onto the shotgun-safety check.

188
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:20,434
Verify it's empty. Clear it.

189
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:21,789
Close the action.

190
00:09:21,876 --> 00:09:24,140
We have police tape,
road flares, spike strips.

191
00:09:24,175 --> 00:09:25,742
You're making my job easy,
Officer West.

192
00:09:25,777 --> 00:09:27,288
- Body-cam test.
- Officer Lucy Chen.

193
00:09:27,313 --> 00:09:29,730
- Officer Nolan. Yippee-ki-yay.
- What are you doing?

194
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:31,105
Just check... Test, check.

195
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,198
- Now we're inside the car.
- Log in to the computer.

196
00:09:33,223 --> 00:09:35,343
- Put in our serial number.
- Test lights and sirens.

197
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,666
Finally, check yourself.

198
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:39,628
You're about to hit the street
with a loaded handgun

199
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:41,423
and no idea what happens next.

200
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,258
<i>7-Adam-15, family dispute,</i>

201
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,044
<i>1401 West Sycamore.</i>

202
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:47,036
<i>Address has history of domestic calls.</i>

203
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:48,616
7-Adam-15, roger.

204
00:09:50,978 --> 00:09:53,055
So, how do you want to do this?

205
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:55,804
Show me what you got.

206
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,709
Police. Open up.

207
00:09:59,075 --> 00:10:02,563
Sir... we've got a call
about a disturbance.

208
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,936
- You all right, ma'am?
- She's fine.

209
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:07,954
So you should leave.

210
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,793
- Trying to make weight?
- What?

211
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:14,544
I used to wrestle
a little bit in college.

212
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:16,761
I see the plastic sticking out
from under your sweat suit.

213
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,581
Nothing my girlfriend hated more

214
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:20,145
than when I was trying to
make fighting weight.

215
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,470
Like my misery was contagious.
You know what I mean?

216
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:26,930
Yeah, I can give you
a few tips if you'd like.

217
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:29,483
Probably better, though,
if the wife doesn't hear, right?

218
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:34,750
Police!

219
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:41,188
Ma'am, we got a call about
a possible burglary in process.

220
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,084
I didn't call anyone.

221
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:46,726
- Watch her.
- Copy.

222
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,410
Hi. LAP...

223
00:10:56,643 --> 00:10:57,907
Ah.

224
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,253
So, why do you want to be a cop?

225
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:02,440
Is this a trick question?

226
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:06,569
You want me to train you, I need
to know why you're in this car.

227
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:09,671
Okay. Um...

228
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:11,568
My parents are both therapists,

229
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:14,060
so I spent my childhood
talking about my feelings...

230
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,496
I've been shot!

231
00:11:15,562 --> 00:11:16,631
- Wh...
- Where are you, Boot?!

232
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:17,884
- What?
- I'm bleeding to death.

233
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,719
You have to call for help.
Where are you?

234
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,001
- Uh...
- Where are you?!

235
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:22,487
Um...

236
00:11:25,305 --> 00:11:26,604
Now I'm dead.

237
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,228
It's your fault. Get out.

238
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:30,624
What?

239
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:32,058
Get out and walk.

240
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:33,652
You can get back in when
you know where you are.

241
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:37,017
Look, I've had this
conversation more times

242
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:40,150
than I can count, and
the result is always the same.

243
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:42,400
When he hits you, press charges.

244
00:11:42,425 --> 00:11:44,589
If you don't, eventually,
he'll kill you.

245
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:47,261
You got it wrong.
My husband just looks aggro.

246
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:50,990
Most of the time, he's a block
of wood, emotionally speaking.

247
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:53,152
I push his buttons just to rile him up.

248
00:11:53,968 --> 00:11:56,268
You can't take things out
on her no matter how much

249
00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:58,965
- she pushes your buttons.
- She's the one that throws down.

250
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:02,170
Hell, that... that girl's
got a crazy temper.

251
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,585
Meaning... what? That she hits you?

252
00:12:06,438 --> 00:12:07,571
No, no, she...

253
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:09,167
sh-she knows better than that.

254
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:10,860
You good out here?

255
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:14,005
Yeah.

256
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:18,116
7-Adam-15, code 4, show us clear.

257
00:12:19,362 --> 00:12:20,520
What do you think?

258
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,017
That we'll be back.

259
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:23,306
Let me get this straight.

260
00:12:23,331 --> 00:12:25,136
You sneak into houses to have sex,

261
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,251
not to rob them?

262
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:28,686
Yeah. It's a fetish.

263
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:30,213
Right.

264
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,444
Shame we can only charge them
with misdemeanor trespass.

265
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:38,013
There's evidence of a burglary.

266
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,005
- They didn't take anything.
- Took a shower.

267
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:42,541
We can charge a 459, just
for stealing the water.

268
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:43,834
That's a novel approach.

269
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:45,236
Thank you, ma'am.

270
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:46,498
I'd say I'm the best-prepared rookie

271
00:12:46,522 --> 00:12:47,775
in the history of the LA...

272
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,642
Are they having sex in our shop?

273
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:53,644
Damn it! Hey!

274
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,446
Knock it off! Don't do that!

275
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:57,048
You know where you are yet,
Officer Chen?

276
00:12:57,964 --> 00:12:59,142
No?

277
00:12:59,251 --> 00:13:01,880
Then finish your story...
why you became a cop.

278
00:13:02,726 --> 00:13:04,354
Here, I'll do it for you.

279
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:05,545
You wanted to piss off your parents

280
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:07,209
for making you an emotional
science experiment.

281
00:13:15,743 --> 00:13:19,369
Gentlemen, I have an honest
question for you.

282
00:13:19,863 --> 00:13:22,013
Were you grown in a
petri dish of stupid?

283
00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:24,284
- _
- Don't pull that crap with me.

284
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,546
Well, aren't you fancy?

285
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:32,063
Tell him that it's immigrants like them

286
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:33,889
that make Americans like you look bad.

287
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,440
If it was up to me, we'd send
them all back by catapult.

288
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:37,546
Um...

289
00:13:37,576 --> 00:13:38,942
_

290
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:42,008
_

291
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:48,083
_

292
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:54,036
Officer Chen, a word?

293
00:13:58,455 --> 00:14:00,522
Do I strike you as a man
who means what he says?

294
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:03,046
- Yes, sir.
- Do I seem laid-back to you?

295
00:14:03,127 --> 00:14:05,296
- Wishy-washy in any way?
- No, sir.

296
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:11,224
_

297
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,084
Everything is a test, Officer Chen,

298
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:15,664
and you just got another "F".

299
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:17,058
I know what you're thinking...

300
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:20,379
was that casual racism a test,
too, or just the Spanish?

301
00:14:20,491 --> 00:14:22,591
Unfortunately for you,
there's no way to know.

302
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,914
Come on!

303
00:14:28,472 --> 00:14:29,772
You think you're so smart!

304
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:31,640
You think I don't know
what you're doing?!

305
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:34,132
I went to Harvard, Yale, the Vatican!

306
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:36,088
Sir, you need to put down the bat!

307
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:37,444
You can't hide from me!

308
00:14:37,469 --> 00:14:40,280
I will go into the wardrobe
through the looking glass!

309
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,794
- So, what do we do?
- De-escalate the situation.

310
00:14:44,754 --> 00:14:46,675
Sir, how about you tell me
what the problem is?

311
00:14:46,736 --> 00:14:49,437
The unicorn is laughing at me!

312
00:14:49,462 --> 00:14:50,928
Okay, great, we can help you with that.

313
00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:52,587
We just need you to
get down off the car.

314
00:14:52,762 --> 00:14:54,395
- No. No, you're trying to trick me.
- No.

315
00:14:54,431 --> 00:14:55,663
You don't want me to find him.

316
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:57,632
Sir, I can handle unicorns, all right?

317
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,371
This is what we train for.

318
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:00,871
I just need you to get off the car

319
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:03,248
and give me a description
so we can find him.

320
00:15:06,048 --> 00:15:08,516
Exactly. Yeah, just jump down.

321
00:15:08,604 --> 00:15:10,204
Put the bat down right there.

322
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:11,756
Excellent. Perfect.

323
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:13,229
What's your name?

324
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:15,351
What's your name?

325
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:18,765
Go get him, Boot.

326
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,866
Too slow.

327
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,534
Hey!

328
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:10,001
Please let go of me!
You have to let me go!

329
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:11,469
You don't know what you're doing!

330
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,929
You don't know what you're doing!

331
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:14,220
You don't know what you're doing!

332
00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:16,458
I have to find him! Help me!

333
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:17,730
I have to find him!

334
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:19,487
- The unicorn! The unicorn!
- Welcome to the arrest.

335
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:21,090
I have to... I have to find him!

336
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:22,704
He needs me!

337
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:23,861
Who needs you?

338
00:16:23,996 --> 00:16:27,019
Lucas! I can't find him!

339
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:31,133
Please, let go of me!

340
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,592
Hi, this is Officer Bishop...

341
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,527
Y-Yes, ma'am,
I'm with your husband now.

342
00:16:34,552 --> 00:16:35,626
Slow down.

343
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:37,555
- Lucas!
- Who's Lucas?

344
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:39,898
- Lucas needs me!
- Sir, where is your boy?

345
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,839
I only left him in the
car for a minute.

346
00:16:41,948 --> 00:16:44,001
The unicorn has him.

347
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,570
That car is gonna be an oven.

348
00:16:47,998 --> 00:16:49,407
We got to find that unicorn.

349
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,308
<i>Be advised, the suspect
vehicle is a gray Corolla.</i>

350
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:56,428
There has got to be

351
00:16:56,453 --> 00:16:57,557
- a better way of doing this
- <i>License plate Two Paul Charles...</i>

352
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,309
- than just driving around.
- We got an airship

353
00:16:59,334 --> 00:17:00,908
and six cars working a grid pattern.

354
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,399
There's no fancy tricks in patrol.

355
00:17:02,424 --> 00:17:03,827
Are we sure the kid's still in the car?

356
00:17:03,852 --> 00:17:05,362
I hope not. It's almost 90.

357
00:17:05,387 --> 00:17:07,862
- We have got to find this kid.
- Pray we don't.

358
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:09,622
Seeing a dead kid changes you.

359
00:17:12,454 --> 00:17:14,086
Gray Corolla, right there!

360
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:22,708
It's the wrong car.

361
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:42,575
Oh, no.

362
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:56,622
Come on!

363
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,083
Geez!

364
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:09,468
Okay, buddy. Hey.

365
00:18:09,603 --> 00:18:11,604
Hey, come on, buddy. Come on.

366
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,792
Come on, buddy. Come on.

367
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:15,975
Come on. Wake up.

368
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,109
Come on.

369
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:18,493
Hey. Hey!

370
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:20,512
Hey. Hey!

371
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:22,186
- Mommy.
- Come on. Let's go find your mommy.

372
00:18:22,211 --> 00:18:23,407
Come on.

373
00:18:23,432 --> 00:18:24,698
Mommy, daddy.

374
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:26,021
Yeah, we're gonna find them.

375
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:27,918
Okay? We're gonna find them for you.

376
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:30,512
Man, my heart is still pounding.

377
00:18:30,857 --> 00:18:32,335
You feeling good about yourself?

378
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:34,868
- Shouldn't I be?
- You stopped thinking,

379
00:18:34,893 --> 00:18:36,013
kept trying to open a car door

380
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:37,161
even after you knew it was locked,

381
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:39,112
used the wrong tool to try
and break the window.

382
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:40,748
Those lost seconds
didn't matter this time,

383
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:41,972
but they may in the future.

384
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,680
So celebrate the victory,

385
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:46,256
but recognize... you got work to do.

386
00:18:46,698 --> 00:18:48,165
Understood.

387
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:51,463
You tired, Officer Nolan?

388
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:52,577
- No, ma'am.
- Good,

389
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:54,294
'cause we got
eight hours left on our shift.

390
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:00,041
First day you buy, Boot.

391
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:01,927
- Okay. What do you want?
- Surprise me.

392
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:04,219
And you will be judged on your choice.

393
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:06,790
So, how was everyone's morning?

394
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,125
Having fun yet?

395
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,511
Think someone could use a hug.

396
00:19:09,536 --> 00:19:11,171
Don't you dare.

397
00:19:11,636 --> 00:19:12,933
Whoa. What's wrong?

398
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:15,596
Uh, her T.O.'s utilizing
time-tested practices

399
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,220
- to intimidate her.
- Oh, well, that's their job, right?

400
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:19,666
They've got to get inside our heads,

401
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:21,674
push our buttons, see how we react.

402
00:19:21,699 --> 00:19:23,966
It's not personal. Just turn it around

403
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:26,253
and figure out what makes
your training officer tick.

404
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:28,368
You make it sound easy. Piece of cake.

405
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:29,515
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

406
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,743
Then I guess you already know

407
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,381
what your T.O. wants for lunch.

408
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,264
How's your day going, Angela?

409
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:37,607
'Cause I saved a kid.

410
00:19:37,632 --> 00:19:38,875
Probably gonna make the paper tomorrow.

411
00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:39,902
Mm.

412
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:41,860
You're so cute trying
to get under my skin.

413
00:19:41,885 --> 00:19:43,852
Trying? She's already under.

414
00:19:44,014 --> 00:19:45,956
Just like you're under hers.

415
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:47,467
What the hell are you talking about?

416
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:49,611
You've wanted to be a detective
since you were a kid.

417
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,908
Talia just wants it 'cause it's
a stepping stone to the top.

418
00:19:51,955 --> 00:19:53,334
And that pisses you off.

419
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,191
Meanwhile, she knows
your ability to be mercenary

420
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:57,096
gives you a leg up 'cause
she's got an overdeveloped

421
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:58,918
sense of morality,
which gets in her way.

422
00:19:59,086 --> 00:20:00,346
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

423
00:20:00,386 --> 00:20:01,553
Well, I don't know why the hell you two

424
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:02,876
are so determined to get out of patrol.

425
00:20:02,981 --> 00:20:04,613
This is where all the fun is.

426
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,886
You didn't forget the hot sauce,
did you, Boot?

427
00:20:09,446 --> 00:20:10,801
Is there meat in this?

428
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:12,788
Uh... no?

429
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,655
<i>7-Adam-15,
return to 1401 West Sycamore.</i>

430
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:18,093
<i>Situation has escalated.</i>

431
00:20:18,274 --> 00:20:19,635
Told you we'd be back.

432
00:20:23,829 --> 00:20:26,264
Open up! Police!

433
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,958
Come here!

434
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:49,564
Nolan, look out!

435
00:20:58,128 --> 00:20:59,227
Not without gloves!

436
00:20:59,252 --> 00:21:01,147
- No! Carlo!
- Easy.

437
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,110
- Stay with me, all right? Stay calm.
- 7-Adam-15.

438
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:04,365
- Just stay calm.
- Requesting an RA unit

439
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,593
to 1401 West Sycamore for a male

440
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:08,246
- suffering multiple stab wounds.
- Just stay calm, okay? Shh.

441
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,736
Just stay calm.
You're gonna be all right.

442
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:12,268
Stay with me. Stay with me.

443
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:33,324
You all right?

444
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,559
Officer Nolan.

445
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:37,561
You all right?

446
00:21:39,526 --> 00:21:41,560
Yeah. Um...

447
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:46,837
The husband hinted that the wife
was abusive, but I...

448
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,919
I didn't push it.

449
00:21:49,312 --> 00:21:51,491
Worst thing you can do
is think, not act.

450
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:53,820
You got to trust your instincts,

451
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,154
even if I ultimately tell you
that you're wrong.

452
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:02,199
You all right, Officer Nolan?

453
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,987
I heard it got real in there.

454
00:22:04,146 --> 00:22:05,889
- Yes, sir, I'm fine.
- Good.

455
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,206
Why don't you go start the paperwork

456
00:22:07,231 --> 00:22:08,491
while I talk to your T.O.

457
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:09,826
Yes, sir.

458
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:15,864
So, how'd he do?

459
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:18,634
He dove right in even
though there was a knife.

460
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,556
Good for him.

461
00:22:21,305 --> 00:22:23,364
But maybe not so good for us.

462
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:27,537
You know why rookies are best
trained young, Officer Bishop?

463
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:29,706
Because kids don't know anything.

464
00:22:30,186 --> 00:22:31,407
40-year-olds?

465
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:33,409
They think they know everything.

466
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,912
Training them's like
turning an oil tanker.

467
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:40,317
Odds are, it ain't gonna happen
before tragedy strikes.

468
00:23:00,034 --> 00:23:01,403
To the first day.

469
00:23:01,538 --> 00:23:02,752
- Mm.
- First day.

470
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:08,950
You want to talk about it?

471
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,489
No.

472
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:18,579
I felt him die.

473
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:21,183
A guy I-I was just talking to.

474
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,602
And I thought I was ready,
but I don't think anything

475
00:23:23,627 --> 00:23:25,294
can prepare you for that.

476
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:28,305
I saw my first body when I was 10.

477
00:23:29,095 --> 00:23:30,462
My dad took me to the morgue,

478
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:34,295
pulled a drawer, and there
was this kid, maybe 18.

479
00:23:34,478 --> 00:23:35,870
O.D.'d on oxy.

480
00:23:35,931 --> 00:23:38,528
That's some questionable
parenting right there.

481
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:40,991
I'm sorry. Didn't your folks put you
in therapy at the same age?

482
00:23:41,016 --> 00:23:42,772
They were trying to
teach me coping skills.

483
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,780
- I...
- Yeah, so was my dad.

484
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:46,615
You know, this job
is a magnifying glass.

485
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,082
It reveals everything,

486
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:50,530
especially the parts
you're trying to hide.

487
00:23:50,788 --> 00:23:53,343
- Okay. Here you go.
- Thank you.

488
00:23:53,368 --> 00:23:55,208
Can I get you anything else?

489
00:23:55,721 --> 00:23:58,426
Not right now. Thanks.

490
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:07,735
Wow. I've never seen
a real badge bunny before.

491
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,613
Well, she's just being friendly.

492
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,405
You really are struggling.

493
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,215
'Cause she practically
handed you her panties.

494
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,466
I'm fine.

495
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:19,286
Hey, listen to me.

496
00:24:19,615 --> 00:24:21,819
What happened wasn't your fault.

497
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:23,305
That guy was never going to admit

498
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,352
a woman was kicking his ass.

499
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:27,272
It wouldn't have mattered if
you'd said anything to Bishop,

500
00:24:27,296 --> 00:24:28,461
and if... i...

501
00:24:30,086 --> 00:24:33,036
If she said any different, then
she was just flat-out wrong.

502
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:38,557
Thank you.

503
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:40,125
You're welcome.

504
00:24:40,216 --> 00:24:43,082
It's karaoke hour.
First up, Jackson and Lucy.

505
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:44,229
Whoo, here we go.

506
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:12,006
♪ Everybody put your glasses up,

507
00:25:12,031 --> 00:25:13,400
and I'll drink to that ♪

508
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,135
Tell me again why we can't
go out for breakfast?

509
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:33,927
Because someone from
the station might see us,

510
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:35,754
and two months of
quality sneaking around

511
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:37,313
would go out the window.

512
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:38,709
- Oh.
- Yeah.

513
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:39,982
Yeah.

514
00:25:47,581 --> 00:25:48,654
Mm.

515
00:25:48,706 --> 00:25:51,081
Wish we didn't have to be so secretive.

516
00:25:51,908 --> 00:25:53,387
It's sweet you want to go steady,

517
00:25:53,424 --> 00:25:54,491
but, uh,

518
00:25:54,516 --> 00:25:56,090
I'm only dating you for this view.

519
00:25:56,144 --> 00:25:57,173
Oh.

520
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:58,584
Good to know our relationship

521
00:25:58,608 --> 00:26:01,242
is dependent on renting
my college roommate's

522
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:02,400
fancy guest house.

523
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:03,762
It's not entirely dependent.

524
00:26:03,787 --> 00:26:05,353
I mean, you are kind of hot,

525
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:07,832
and the "against the rules" part
is a turn-on, so...

526
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,765
Uh, it actually won't be
if Sergeant Grey finds out.

527
00:26:10,813 --> 00:26:12,324
Well, I'm not gonna tell him. Are you?

528
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:14,681
- I'm being serious.
- That guy is gunning for me.

529
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:17,989
Look, this kind of
obstacle's new to you,

530
00:26:18,014 --> 00:26:19,713
but it's status quo for me.

531
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:22,275
You're a novelty item right now,
but in 13 months,

532
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,932
you'll be a P2, and the
cops will treat you

533
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,014
like one of the guys, but I'll...

534
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:28,735
I'll have to prove myself
to every cop I work with.

535
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:30,408
Fair enough.

536
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:32,177
We'll keep it under the radar.

537
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,400
I just don't want to screw it up.

538
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,502
Me neither.

539
00:26:41,277 --> 00:26:43,344
So, all right, all right. Settle down.

540
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:45,345
I just got a disturbing video.

541
00:26:45,783 --> 00:26:47,804
Never seen anything so horrific.

542
00:26:48,212 --> 00:26:50,050
So prepare yourselves.

543
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:02,231
<i>It's... Give me a sec.</i>

544
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:04,513
Such grace and athleticism

545
00:27:04,538 --> 00:27:06,187
has never before been seen

546
00:27:06,212 --> 00:27:08,037
in the LAPD.

547
00:27:08,062 --> 00:27:10,150
Is that a gazelle wearing the blues?

548
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,240
Or a dinosaur from
a long forgotten age?

549
00:27:15,366 --> 00:27:18,783
Now you will see Officer Chen
execute a perfect flying tackle.

550
00:27:26,452 --> 00:27:27,853
All right, fun's over.

551
00:27:28,285 --> 00:27:31,359
This is a BOLO for Mr. Lance Selby,

552
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:33,185
who violated his parole yesterday.

553
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:35,727
Scale from 1 to 10, this guy's a 12.

554
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,750
Did a nickel for attempted
murder with a claw hammer.

555
00:27:38,812 --> 00:27:41,317
So whoever gets him off the street

556
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:45,205
will get a sincere handshake and...

557
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:46,719
Super Bowl Sunday off.

558
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:50,456
That's it. Be safe out there.

559
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:52,555
What are you doing?

560
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,162
I'm just looking into the
BOLO that Grey handed out.

561
00:27:55,227 --> 00:27:57,576
Found a known associate
in our patrol zone.

562
00:27:57,636 --> 00:27:58,825
Darius Nguyen.

563
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,560
We're not detectives, Officer Nolan.

564
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:04,462
No, but I do believe
detective is a necessary stop

565
00:28:04,487 --> 00:28:05,761
on the way to chief.

566
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,061
I've decided on your punishment.

567
00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:12,321
Are you gonna tell me what it is?

568
00:28:13,506 --> 00:28:15,589
More of a "show you" kind of guy.

569
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,540
Ghost Head.

570
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:23,555
No, no, hold up a minute.

571
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,528
Yo, this is harassment.

572
00:28:26,612 --> 00:28:29,371
What? No, it's just good
customer service.

573
00:28:29,482 --> 00:28:30,981
Kind of like a frequent flyer program

574
00:28:31,017 --> 00:28:32,483
for dirt-bag drug dealers.

575
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:34,496
Search him, Boot.

576
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:35,778
Uh...

577
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,230
Turn around, grab the wall.

578
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,017
Make me... Boot.

579
00:28:53,177 --> 00:28:55,450
Keep your hands up, Chen.

580
00:28:55,555 --> 00:28:56,990
Don't let him get on top of you!

581
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,790
You're under arrest.

582
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,420
That was my punishment?

583
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:09,678
Yep. Plus I got to see if
you could handle yourself,

584
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:12,197
so it's really a two-fer.

585
00:29:22,985 --> 00:29:24,451
Is there a problem, Officer?

586
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:25,686
- This your gym?
- Yeah.

587
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:28,065
- You see this guy around?
- Detectives came by yesterday.

588
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:30,238
Told them I haven't seen Selby
since before he went away.

589
00:29:31,756 --> 00:29:34,321
You know, I've built everything,

590
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:37,327
from mansions to an
honest-to-God outhouse.

591
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:40,202
But I've never seen a circuit breaker

592
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,208
installed next to a water pipe.

593
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:47,451
Mm. You sure you don't
know where Selby's at?

594
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,477
When you're telling
this story in lock up,

595
00:29:55,824 --> 00:29:57,081
you might want to leave out the part

596
00:29:57,106 --> 00:29:58,800
where you got your ass
kicked by a girl.

597
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,802
Hey! Hey!

598
00:30:01,011 --> 00:30:03,239
Hey, let him go! Come on.

599
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,860
You all right here?

600
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:09,297
For real.

601
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:10,428
Isabel?

602
00:30:10,466 --> 00:30:12,466
Leave him alone. Isab... Isabel...

603
00:30:14,451 --> 00:30:16,719
...it... it's... it's me.

604
00:30:17,054 --> 00:30:18,369
It's Tim.

605
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,157
It's okay.

606
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,826
I've been trying to find you just...

607
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,683
just to make sure you were okay.

608
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:30,030
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

609
00:30:30,066 --> 00:30:31,252
I'm fine! Get off me!

610
00:30:31,277 --> 00:30:34,278
I just want to help.
I just want to help.

611
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:37,773
- You want to help me?
- Yeah.

612
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:41,095
Give me all your cash.

613
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:44,049
- What?
- Give me your money.

614
00:30:44,141 --> 00:30:45,607
God, I'll get you rehab.

615
00:30:45,716 --> 00:30:46,914
I don't need rehab.

616
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,951
Come on.

617
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:51,766
Please.

618
00:31:10,158 --> 00:31:12,339
Hey. What...

619
00:31:12,364 --> 00:31:13,818
What do you want me
to do with this guy?

620
00:31:15,032 --> 00:31:16,477
Just let him go.

621
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:19,433
Let him go.

622
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:22,607
Let's go.

623
00:31:36,098 --> 00:31:38,240
What the hell just happened?

624
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:41,180
That was my wife.

625
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,751
I haven't seen her in almost a year.

626
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:50,405
I won't tell anyone.

627
00:31:53,402 --> 00:31:55,201
You're damn right you won't.

628
00:31:55,461 --> 00:31:58,007
<i>7-Adam-15. Requesting additional unit</i>

629
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:00,026
<i>to meet us at 1350 Bellview Street.</i>

630
00:32:00,082 --> 00:32:02,106
<i>Possible location of our BOLO suspect.</i>

631
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:03,362
<i>We are en route.</i>

632
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:10,002
7-Adam-19. Show us responding.

633
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,441
<i>7-Adam-19, be advised,</i>

634
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:19,399
<i>we are approximately five minutes away.</i>

635
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:23,258
That's the address for Selby.

636
00:32:24,011 --> 00:32:25,978
All right, we'll set up
in the alley behind

637
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:28,827
in case Selby rabbits and Bishop
and Nolan come calling.

638
00:32:43,955 --> 00:32:45,709
That's our guy, Selby.

639
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,099
Call it in. Backup and airship.

640
00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:50,755
7-Adam-19.

641
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,695
Show us code 6 on BOLO suspect.

642
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,042
<i>Need backup and airship.</i>

643
00:32:54,106 --> 00:32:55,205
They got him.

644
00:32:58,875 --> 00:33:01,046
No, no, no, you stay here till
we clear them from that car.

645
00:33:02,516 --> 00:33:04,101
LAPD, gentlemen.

646
00:33:04,163 --> 00:33:06,330
Step away from the car
and show me your hands.

647
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:08,353
There a problem, officer?

648
00:33:09,823 --> 00:33:11,690
There will be if you don't
show me those hands.

649
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:13,637
Now!

650
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:30,108
7-Adam-19.

651
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,504
<i>Officer down. Shots fired.</i>

652
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,810
In the alley of Bellview and Clinton.

653
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:38,415
<i>I repeat, officer down!
Please send help right away!</i>

654
00:33:53,842 --> 00:33:56,009
Don't worry about me! Shoot back!

655
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,545
You good?

656
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:22,371
Yeah. Cover me, and I'll cuff him.

657
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:24,681
Nolan, wait!

658
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:20,859
- You okay?
- No! I got shot!

659
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:24,569
You go get him, Boot!

660
00:35:24,677 --> 00:35:26,691
Just go!

661
00:35:27,395 --> 00:35:29,206
When this is over, we're
gonna have a conversation

662
00:35:29,231 --> 00:35:30,976
about you running off. Where's Selby?

663
00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:32,559
He went through the alley.

664
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:34,396
Suspect heading northbound

665
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:36,440
towards residence on Clinton Street.

666
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:38,842
<i>7-Adam-07 arriving on scene.</i>

667
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:49,827
Officer West, get out
your gun and cover me!

668
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:58,320
Damn it! Get your ass up
and engage the suspect!

669
00:35:58,733 --> 00:36:00,059
Get up!

670
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:19,827
Hey! Hey!

671
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:21,811
Help!

672
00:36:23,706 --> 00:36:25,947
- Selby!
- I'll kill her!

673
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:27,381
- Drop it! Drop the knife!
- I'll kill her!

674
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:28,829
- Shut up!
- You don't have to do this.

675
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:31,901
You shot a cop, but it seems you
only managed to piss him off.

676
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:33,037
You're not a murderer yet.

677
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:34,439
- Get back!
- I can't do that!

678
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:37,006
- Now!
- I can't do that!

679
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:41,739
Look, Selby, we are in this
moment together, all right?

680
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:45,280
What happens next could
change both of our lives.

681
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,961
Look, I became a cop to help
people, not kill them.

682
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,072
But if you hurt her,

683
00:36:50,254 --> 00:36:53,093
I will pull this trigger,
and you will die.

684
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:55,454
I'll see your face every time
I close my eyes,

685
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,560
but you'll never see
anything ever again.

686
00:36:57,647 --> 00:36:59,720
Here's what we're gonna do.

687
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,412
I'm gonna lower my gun, and
you're gonna let her go, okay?

688
00:37:03,752 --> 00:37:05,201
Nice and easy.

689
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:08,389
Lower that knife. Nice and easy.

690
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,372
You're gonna let her go.

691
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:12,325
I'm lowering my...

692
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:15,211
Facedown!

693
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,012
Facedown! Put your hands
behind your back!

694
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,178
Call it in, Officer Nolan.

695
00:37:27,952 --> 00:37:30,307
Suspect in custody. Code 4.

696
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,406
Hey.

697
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:45,941
What's the word on Tim?

698
00:37:46,115 --> 00:37:47,248
He's out of surgery.

699
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:48,699
Officer Nolan.

700
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,798
I heard you left your partner.

701
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,782
Almost got her killed.

702
00:37:54,344 --> 00:37:56,818
See, I knew your mid-life crisis

703
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:58,674
would put my people in harm's way.

704
00:37:59,149 --> 00:38:00,747
You're done, Officer Nolan.

705
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:04,284
- Sergeant Grey, I...
- I said go home!

706
00:38:24,629 --> 00:38:26,257
You wanted to see me?

707
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:28,596
Nolan was trying to save
two fellow officers.

708
00:38:28,645 --> 00:38:30,135
It doesn't matter. He left his partner.

709
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,075
You tell a guy that he's not
wanted on the first day,

710
00:38:33,122 --> 00:38:35,189
he's gonna throw caution
to the wind to prove himself.

711
00:38:35,427 --> 00:38:36,874
Are you saying this is my fault?

712
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,850
I'm saying he deserves a chance.

713
00:38:38,937 --> 00:38:41,563
Why? Because you had him assigned here?

714
00:38:41,723 --> 00:38:43,154
Yeah, I heard.

715
00:38:43,245 --> 00:38:46,047
- The boot no one wanted except you.
- That's right.

716
00:38:46,202 --> 00:38:48,460
I think there's value in having
a rookie with his perspective.

717
00:38:48,485 --> 00:38:50,707
Lives were saved today because of it.

718
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:53,140
You're dismissed.

719
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:10,900
You were right.

720
00:39:11,781 --> 00:39:14,310
I did come here looking
for reinvention.

721
00:39:15,391 --> 00:39:19,152
I didn't understand
what it meant to be a cop.

722
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:23,300
It takes sacrifice.

723
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:31,462
I know about you and Nolan.

724
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:33,470
And you were right to keep it secret,

725
00:39:33,495 --> 00:39:35,048
but you're wrong to keep it going.

726
00:39:35,781 --> 00:39:37,609
It'll brand you.

727
00:39:38,035 --> 00:39:42,222
No matter how good you are
or how hard you work.

728
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:44,724
Break things off before it's too late.

729
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,332
Demands strength when you
feel your weakest.

730
00:39:54,572 --> 00:39:56,458
If you don't have what
it takes on the streets,

731
00:39:56,483 --> 00:39:57,736
then you're not a cop.

732
00:39:57,985 --> 00:39:59,537
Freeze up again, and you're done.

733
00:39:59,825 --> 00:40:02,262
I'll call up your dad
and tell him myself.

734
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,915
I thought I had to become someone else

735
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:12,792
to do this job, that who I was
before wasn't good enough.

736
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:15,754
I was wrong.

737
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,890
I earned my place here.

738
00:40:18,895 --> 00:40:20,707
And I'm not leaving.

739
00:40:23,615 --> 00:40:26,898
You know why I do this job,
Officer Nolan?

740
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,967
Because you're a people person?

741
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,405
No.

742
00:40:34,028 --> 00:40:36,650
This job is my calling.

743
00:40:37,987 --> 00:40:39,778
And I have a responsibility
to protect it

744
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:41,139
from those who are unworthy.

745
00:40:41,186 --> 00:40:42,658
- I understand.
- Good.

746
00:40:42,755 --> 00:40:45,294
Then understand I will haze,
harass, and humiliate you

747
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,050
every chance I get

748
00:40:47,169 --> 00:40:48,632
in the hope that you choose

749
00:40:48,657 --> 00:40:50,422
to abandon this misguided quest.

750
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:56,961
And if this job actually is<i> my</i> calling?

751
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,844
Then nothing I do to you will matter.

752
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:16,738
I'm sorry.

753
00:41:16,763 --> 00:41:18,235
You gonna leave me again?

754
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,463
No.

755
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:21,250
Then we're good.

756
00:41:24,145 --> 00:41:26,295
Okay, let's get to it.

757
00:41:26,543 --> 00:41:28,191
Officer Bradford should be getting out

758
00:41:28,227 --> 00:41:29,903
of intensive care today.

759
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,780
If you have some time
after your shift...

760
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,655
I'm sure he won't appreciate it.

761
00:41:44,003 --> 00:41:46,542
Today. See, every day, we start fresh,

762
00:41:46,723 --> 00:41:48,476
because we can't affect the past.

763
00:41:48,812 --> 00:41:51,385
But we damn sure can make
a difference today.

764
00:41:52,464 --> 00:41:53,775
All right.

765
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:56,901
There was a carjacking last
night on Western and Wilshire.

766
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,703
Description matches the crew
we've been hunting,

767
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:00,607
so we need to hunt smarter.

768
00:42:01,058 --> 00:42:04,768
Lopez and West, I want you
to live in that RD today.

769
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:08,563
So Bishop and Nolan, coordinate
with the robbery table...
