1
00:00:05,287 --> 00:00:08,140
Shouldn't we be pulling them
over, for being on their phones?

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,134
All of them? We'll be writing

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:12,491
23120 tickets till judgment day.

4
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,126
23123.

5
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:15,846
You tried to slip that past me.

6
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:19,674
23123 is the hands-free vehicle code.

7
00:00:19,744 --> 00:00:22,312
Congratulations. So, what's 23120?

8
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:26,447
Driving while flossing?

9
00:00:26,932 --> 00:00:28,909
"No driver shall operate a motor vehicle

10
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:32,286
"while wearing glasses having a
temple width of 1/2" or more

11
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:34,665
if any part of said temple extends

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,924
below the horizontal center of the lens

13
00:00:37,035 --> 00:00:39,203
"so as to interfere
with lateral vision."

14
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,536
Yeah, that's what...
actually what I meant.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,110
Where's your rook book?

16
00:00:42,195 --> 00:00:43,730
In my locker.

17
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:45,127
It weighs four pounds.

18
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:46,481
I was told I'd be fired if I lost it.

19
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,676
You don't keep your gun
in your locker, do you?

20
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:50,305
You need to know the information

21
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,806
in that book backwards and forwards.

22
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:53,672
You should be studying
it every chance you get.

23
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:54,930
I do, every night.

24
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,752
- Mm-hmm.
- You don't believe me?

25
00:00:56,836 --> 00:00:59,075
New job, new city, newly single.

26
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:01,270
Color me doubtful you're
living a monastic life.

27
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,530
<i>7-Adam-15, armed robbery in progress.</i>

28
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:05,459
<i>- 3577 Olvera.
- Here we go.</i>

29
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:20,996
Get down! Get down!

30
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,070
Flat on the ground.

31
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:23,176
Face down.

32
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:24,962
I got him, Boot. Get him.

33
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:31,697
Out of the way!

34
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:33,793
Hold it.

35
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:34,994
Show me your hands.

36
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:38,584
Take off that mask nice and slow.

37
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:42,228
Hands behind your head.

38
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:43,807
Interlace your fingers.

39
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:45,169
Do not move.

40
00:01:51,492 --> 00:01:53,333
What's in the box, big fella?

41
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:55,997
It's a urine sample for a drug test.

42
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:58,351
If it got to the lab, then Bo
would've violated his parole

43
00:01:58,376 --> 00:01:59,696
and gone back to prison for two years,

44
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:01,576
so we boosted it.

45
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:03,852
Well, now he's going away for longer.

46
00:02:03,905 --> 00:02:05,139
You steal that, too?

47
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,826
It was my dad's.

48
00:02:06,888 --> 00:02:08,454
I've been trying to work
up the courage to propose,

49
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:10,741
but what if he says no?

50
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:12,592
The guy's all I can think about.

51
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:15,555
He's a drug addict and an ex-con.

52
00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:17,208
I don't care.

53
00:02:17,393 --> 00:02:18,726
I love him.

54
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:24,139
I love you, Bo Sokolovsky.

55
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:27,762
And I have since the moment
that you hit on me at the zoo.

56
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,180
And I want to spend the
rest of my life with you...

57
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:33,134
starting in two to five years.

58
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:35,911
Will you marry me?

59
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:37,205
Hell, yeah.

60
00:02:44,359 --> 00:02:45,481
It's awesome.

61
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:51,327
Okay.

62
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,305
Yeah, I'm gonna need that.

63
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,651
That marriage is gonna last forever,

64
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,667
or flame out in five minutes.

65
00:03:07,692 --> 00:03:11,027
Either way, best proposal story ever.

66
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:13,513
O-Okay, that's wonderful,

67
00:03:13,538 --> 00:03:15,869
but the question I asked was,

68
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,390
"In what circumstance can
a firearm be discharged"

69
00:03:18,415 --> 00:03:20,364
"at a moving vehicle?"

70
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:22,271
Only if the person in the vehicle

71
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:24,264
is immediately threatening
an officer or another person

72
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:26,429
with deadly force using something

73
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:27,530
other than the vehicle.

74
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:28,605
Yeah.

75
00:03:28,649 --> 00:03:31,366
I don't really have one...
a good proposal story.

76
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,374
Yeah, well, there's always next time.

77
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:35,741
Not, uh...

78
00:03:35,766 --> 00:03:36,869
S... Not with me.

79
00:03:36,894 --> 00:03:38,503
- I-I just meant that...
- No, and I-I wasn't fishing.

80
00:03:38,527 --> 00:03:40,430
I was just oversharing. I...

81
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:42,123
Who knows if I'm even
gonna get married again?

82
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:44,316
I mean, and this whole cop thing

83
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:46,704
is a legendary relationship killer.

84
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,281
Though we seem to be

85
00:03:50,386 --> 00:03:53,054
navigating it fairly well, aren't we?

86
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,686
Yeah.

87
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,412
Yeah.

88
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:00,444
Uh, okay.

89
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,153
List all descriptors needed for
a firearm in a crime report.

90
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:06,560
- Officer Nolan.
- Mm-hmm. Yes?

91
00:04:06,662 --> 00:04:08,230
Can you focus?

92
00:04:08,255 --> 00:04:10,456
- We need to study.
- Mm-hmm.

93
00:04:10,593 --> 00:04:12,876
What are the descriptors of a firearm?

94
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:15,836
A serial number, maker's name, model,

95
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:17,816
caliber or gauge,

96
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:20,527
color of metal...

97
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,134
length of barrel.

98
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:26,781
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

99
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,545
Everyone have a seat.

100
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:34,399
Today is a special day for our rookies.

101
00:04:34,784 --> 00:04:36,889
'Cause today...

102
00:04:37,347 --> 00:04:39,026
we switch things up.

103
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:40,364
That's right.

104
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:42,907
Everybody gets a new training officer.

105
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:46,546
Nolan, you'll be riding
with Officer Lopez.

106
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:49,806
West, you'll be riding
with Officer Bradford.

107
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,135
And Chen, you'll be with Bishop.

108
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:55,043
But learning how to navigate a new T.O.

109
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:57,636
is not your only challenge.

110
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,340
By the end of next shift,

111
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,401
I expect every rookie to uncover

112
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:06,734
something personal about
their training officer,

113
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:11,292
something they don't want you to know.

114
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:15,510
This will be a test of your
investigative instincts

115
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:17,304
and your fortitude.

116
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:20,578
Best insight will win a day off.

117
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,211
Worst one...

118
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:25,107
handles Saturday night cavity searches.

119
00:05:27,116 --> 00:05:28,850
That's it. Good luck.

120
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:34,232
So, what's Lopez like to ride with?

121
00:05:34,304 --> 00:05:36,472
Yeah, like I'm gonna
give you a head start.

122
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:39,639
Tim's gonna eat me alive, isn't he?

123
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:42,301
You? No. You're a rock star,

124
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:44,967
a legacy who excelled at the academy.

125
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:48,216
If Tim could create a cop in a
test tube, it would be you.

126
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:50,586
Unless he's gonna set
out to dominate you

127
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,264
and prove that you aren't all that.

128
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:55,521
Is it too late to change my answer?
'Cause, uh, <i>that.</i>

129
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:57,552
Oh, hey, what about Talia?

130
00:05:57,594 --> 00:05:59,049
Any tips on how to get on her good side?

131
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,465
Oh, I'm sorry, Jackson's right.

132
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,158
No head starts.

133
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,067
Is the kid really a rock star?

134
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:07,891
Jackson?

135
00:06:08,558 --> 00:06:11,072
Yeah. He's better prepared
than any rookie I've ever had.

136
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:14,376
Screw prep. How is he out on the street?

137
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:16,322
So far, so good.

138
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,186
What about Nolan?

139
00:06:18,529 --> 00:06:19,932
He's a talker.

140
00:06:21,384 --> 00:06:22,588
Oh.

141
00:06:22,659 --> 00:06:24,823
Uh, usually Officer Bishop has me drive.

142
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:26,882
She feels it's a better
way to evaluate how I...

143
00:06:26,907 --> 00:06:28,907
This is my shop. I drive.

144
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:30,606
Copy that.

145
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:32,162
So...

146
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:34,004
I was raised by a single mom.

147
00:06:34,029 --> 00:06:35,501
Everything I own was a hand-me-down

148
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:36,991
from my four brothers, so I care about

149
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:38,698
what I wear and how I look.

150
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:40,026
Now you don't have to
spend the next two days

151
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,728
hunting for insight.

152
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:43,116
I don't think that's how Sergeant Grey

153
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,704
wanted me to gain insight.

154
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:46,229
Are you a teacher's pet, Boot?

155
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:48,801
'Cause I thought I was gonna
get a change of pace with you.

156
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,570
Uh, no, ma'am. Just looking to get

157
00:06:50,595 --> 00:06:51,630
the most out of the experience.

158
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:54,109
Good. Because if I win
you Grey's day off,

159
00:06:54,134 --> 00:06:55,835
you're gonna fix my garage door.

160
00:06:55,886 --> 00:06:57,620
I heard you were a contractor.

161
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:59,298
Yeah, no, happy to help.

162
00:06:59,393 --> 00:07:00,474
Probably gonna need a little more than.

163
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:02,521
"She likes nice clothes"
to win this thing.

164
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:03,811
So, where are we off to?

165
00:07:03,836 --> 00:07:05,370
Court. I have to testify in a trial.

166
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:06,695
Should take a few hours.

167
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:08,017
Quiet time, starting now.

168
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,924
This is gonna be a great day.

169
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:16,200
I was glad when Sergeant
Grey paired us up.

170
00:07:16,968 --> 00:07:18,902
- You were?
- Yeah.

171
00:07:18,927 --> 00:07:21,395
Being a police officer is in your DNA.

172
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:22,898
It's gonna be my privilege to...

173
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:24,004
I've been shot!

174
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,078
Where are you, Boot?

175
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,093
I'm bleeding to death. You
have to call for help.

176
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:28,572
Where are you?

177
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,875
North Mansfield, cross
street is Beverly Boulevard.

178
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,438
There's a medical
center on Third Street,

179
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:34,163
but I would see that you
were taken to Cedars.

180
00:07:34,485 --> 00:07:35,923
Better trauma center.

181
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:38,663
And the best coffee in L.A.
is two blocks down.

182
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:44,618
So, all the stuff about...

183
00:07:44,643 --> 00:07:46,037
The only thing that's
gonna make me happy

184
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:47,729
is breaking your spirit.

185
00:07:57,108 --> 00:07:59,034
- Look, uh...
- Save it.

186
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:01,054
- But...
- I said save it.

187
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,701
You want to risk your reputation

188
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:04,894
to get it on with Nolan,
that's your call.

189
00:08:05,246 --> 00:08:07,681
I only care if it impacts
your performance.

190
00:08:09,383 --> 00:08:10,547
It won't.

191
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:12,540
Good, then there's nothing
left to talk about.

192
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,961
And don't even think of
looking for insight into me.

193
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:22,374
Registration is expired on that tag.

194
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:23,830
Call it in.

195
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:25,658
7-Adam-15,

196
00:08:25,683 --> 00:08:26,967
show us at a vehicle stop.

197
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,860
at Loma Linda and Fountain.

198
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:32,678
Blue Outback, 2-Sam-Adam-Mary-5-6-4.

199
00:08:32,738 --> 00:08:33,766
<i>7-Adam-15,</i>

200
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:35,715
<i>that vehicle is suspected
in a hit and run.</i>

201
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,109
7-Adam-15, four occupants just bailed,

202
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:40,210
heading north and south.

203
00:08:40,235 --> 00:08:42,202
Get the driver, Boot! I'll cut them off.

204
00:08:58,233 --> 00:08:59,938
LAPD, get up.

205
00:09:00,015 --> 00:09:01,551
Hands behind your head.

206
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,930
Turn around.

207
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:04,458
Don't move.

208
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:15,630
What are you doing?

209
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:17,246
I told you to get the driver.

210
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:18,362
This guy was right here.

211
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:19,821
Am I in trouble for catching a criminal?

212
00:09:19,846 --> 00:09:21,074
What was his crime?

213
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:22,391
Who were your friends in the car?

214
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:23,611
I never met them before.

215
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:25,217
They just saw me walking
and gave me a ride.

216
00:09:25,242 --> 00:09:26,776
Then why did you run?

217
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,221
'Cause everyone else did.

218
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:30,545
Did you find anything
on him when you searched him?

219
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,764
Driver's the only one we can
legally tie to the vehicle.

220
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:33,889
You should know that.

221
00:09:33,914 --> 00:09:35,782
Page 117 of your rook book.

222
00:09:35,998 --> 00:09:37,432
Cut him loose.

223
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:42,258
Never been to the courthouse before.

224
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,716
This is exciting.

225
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,327
That feeling will pass.

226
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:47,317
Caught this break and
enter 10 months ago.

227
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:49,166
Since then, it's been two
preliminary hearings,

228
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:51,101
two motions to suppress. It's endless.

229
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:53,431
Hey, Lopez. Looking good.

230
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,710
Thanks. How's your wife?

231
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:59,000
This is the only place in L.A.

232
00:09:59,025 --> 00:10:01,264
where you can find all the law
enforcement agencies together...

233
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:03,854
LAPD, Highway Patrol,
Sheriff's Department...

234
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:06,867
everyone acting like the
top of the food chain.

235
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,027
See that guy with the comb-over?

236
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:12,770
They call him Hot Stuff.

237
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:14,000
Know why?

238
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:15,627
Nothing comes to mind.

239
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:17,795
'Cause he somehow managed
to get sriracha in his eyes

240
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,120
while he was driving.

241
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:20,538
Ended up in Echo Park Lake.

242
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:24,053
Oh, and that's Officer Davis.

243
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,714
She collects American Girl dolls

244
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:28,338
and uses them to recreate
scenes from "50 Shades."

245
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:30,006
She's single, if you're wondering.

246
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:31,906
Thank you. How do you know all this?

247
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,674
Ah, well, if you want to keep secrets,

248
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:35,208
don't work in law enforcement.

249
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,340
I had us attached to a raid.

250
00:10:44,365 --> 00:10:46,366
Figured you didn't get a round
off the day I got shot,

251
00:10:46,391 --> 00:10:48,532
so you'd be itching to
throw some bullets around.

252
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:52,753
Detective Singh.

253
00:10:52,931 --> 00:10:53,998
Bradford.

254
00:10:54,118 --> 00:10:56,055
When are you gonna make the
jump out of patrol, huh?

255
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:57,821
Never. I work for a living.

256
00:10:57,846 --> 00:10:59,296
Yeah.

257
00:11:01,124 --> 00:11:02,262
This West's kid?

258
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:04,188
Yes, sir. Jackson West.

259
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,189
You ready to mix it up, son?

260
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:07,998
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

261
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,501
We got a known gunrunner two blocks up.

262
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:12,561
We can pin at least three
murder weapons on him.

263
00:11:12,698 --> 00:11:14,332
We're gonna put eyeballs on his place,

264
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:17,029
make sure he's home, then we go in hot.

265
00:11:18,503 --> 00:11:20,770
You're rolling with the
big boys now, Boot.

266
00:11:35,576 --> 00:11:37,579
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

267
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:11,089
Shoot.

268
00:12:11,156 --> 00:12:12,971
Officer needs help!

269
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:14,896
Prisoner on the loose!

270
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:25,074
Stop! Police!

271
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:49,930
Sorry. I tried to catch the guy.

272
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,333
Well, now we got to find him.

273
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,088
Fugitive's name is Nestor Garcia.

274
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:54,297
He's a mid-level drug dealer

275
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:55,890
looking at 10 to 20 if he's convicted.

276
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:57,278
Residence is in Boyle Heights.

277
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:58,992
I volunteered us to check it out.

278
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,070
Leave that in the locker next time.

279
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:05,210
Officer Bishop suggested...

280
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:07,491
- Do I look like Officer Bishop?
- No.

281
00:13:07,572 --> 00:13:09,840
Grey switched it up so you guys
get a different perspective.

282
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:12,314
Mine is you do your homework at home.

283
00:13:14,472 --> 00:13:16,006
Heard you caught a bullet.

284
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:17,331
Went right through me.

285
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:18,948
Barely worth mentioning to you.

286
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,441
Singh's been stabbed six times.

287
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:21,886
Nine.

288
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,698
It was a busy summer.

289
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:25,182
I'll say.

290
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,565
So, have you known
Officer Bradford long?

291
00:13:27,646 --> 00:13:28,969
Don't answer that.

292
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,488
Watch Commander's got
him looking for insight

293
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:31,512
into his T.O.

294
00:13:31,537 --> 00:13:32,811
Copy that.

295
00:13:32,931 --> 00:13:34,444
But my silence won't be cheap.

296
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:36,127
You're not getting my Dodger tickets.

297
00:13:38,844 --> 00:13:40,888
One game. That's it.

298
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:52,208
Two pizzas?

299
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:53,867
The gunrunners are at home.

300
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:56,494
We're in business. Let's go gear up.

301
00:13:58,236 --> 00:14:00,438
Do you, uh, date cops?

302
00:14:01,288 --> 00:14:02,376
I'm not asking...

303
00:14:02,401 --> 00:14:04,763
I mean, just trying to get some insight.

304
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:07,001
You know, that, um, CHP
officer at the courthouse

305
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:08,633
- was hitting on you.
- It's not worth it.

306
00:14:08,658 --> 00:14:10,197
That guy can run around
racking up trophies,

307
00:14:10,222 --> 00:14:11,769
but I date one cop, and I get a rep,

308
00:14:11,794 --> 00:14:13,695
so I fish in other pools.

309
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,526
Nestor Garcia, police.

310
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:17,859
Come out.

311
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,844
What if we were to talk
to the local merchants?

312
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:30,680
All right.

313
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:32,441
Hey, how much?

314
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:33,827
A dollar.

315
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:36,052
A little steep, but all right.

316
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:37,867
Thank you.

317
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,052
Mm.

318
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:43,207
Didn't expect it to be so, uh...

319
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:45,144
thick.

320
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,834
You know the family next door?

321
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,671
Sure. The dad's a drug dealer.

322
00:14:50,608 --> 00:14:53,037
My mom gets really talky
when she has Chardonnay.

323
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:54,504
Have you seen him around today?

324
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:56,553
No, he's probably at the thing.

325
00:14:56,578 --> 00:14:57,894
What thing?

326
00:14:58,402 --> 00:15:00,203
Buy some more lemonade
and I'll tell you.

327
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:02,973
Are you trying to extort a
law enforcement officer?

328
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,498
No, it's basic supply and demand.

329
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,424
I have something you need,
so I can set the price.

330
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,854
At least he's getting
a quality education.

331
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,113
Too bad he won't get the same
one in juvenile detention.

332
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:15,180
You got a permit for
this lemonade stand?

333
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:19,830
There he is.

334
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:21,070
What's the party for again?

335
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:22,771
His daughter's quinceañera.

336
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,241
- 15th birthday.
- Oh, sorry.

337
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:27,900
We don't get a lot of those
in rural Pennsylvania.

338
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:29,527
It's fun.

339
00:15:31,254 --> 00:15:32,414
Aww.

340
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,607
He escaped custody to share
a dance with his daughter.

341
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:37,490
That's kind of sweet.

342
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,765
It's selfish, 'cause
now her memory of this

343
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:42,260
is gonna be us arresting him
in front of her entire family.

344
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:43,882
He did it for himself, not her.

345
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:45,475
That never occurred to me.

346
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,070
That's because you had
a dad who was around.

347
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:52,759
Let me guess. Your dad was M.I.A.,

348
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:55,694
show up when it's convenient,
bring a toy, act like a savior.

349
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:58,351
It was a stuffed animal.

350
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,939
Last one he brought, I fed
to the garbage disposal.

351
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:03,268
And then he got cancer.

352
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,637
So...

353
00:16:11,724 --> 00:16:13,658
do we let them finish the dance?

354
00:16:13,827 --> 00:16:14,927
Of course.

355
00:16:14,994 --> 00:16:16,461
I'm not a monster.

356
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:33,707
You told me to go after the driver,

357
00:16:33,732 --> 00:16:35,762
and I deviated from your instruction.

358
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:38,268
- It won't happen again.
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:16:38,552 --> 00:16:40,325
You don't believe me?

360
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,203
I believe you do what you want
and you rationalize it after.

361
00:16:43,364 --> 00:16:46,097
I don't take your advice, and
then you... you punish me?

362
00:16:46,122 --> 00:16:47,365
How is that right?

363
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,157
Boot, you have a fundamental
misunderstanding

364
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:50,470
of what's happening here.

365
00:16:50,617 --> 00:16:52,231
So enlighten me.

366
00:16:52,487 --> 00:16:55,001
Learning how to be a cop is the
hardest thing you'll ever do.

367
00:16:55,063 --> 00:16:56,596
And instead of focusing
everything you have

368
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:58,347
on the task at hand,
you split your focus

369
00:16:58,372 --> 00:16:59,768
to be with Nolan.

370
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,107
And you risk losing it completely

371
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:02,412
if you're ever found out.

372
00:17:02,664 --> 00:17:05,136
You think you're the first
rookie to date a cop?

373
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:06,783
This city is littered
with the failed potential

374
00:17:06,807 --> 00:17:08,459
of rookies like you.

375
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,350
With all due respect, ma'am,

376
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,009
there are no other rookies like me.

377
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,491
Don't fool yourself, Boot.
They're all like you.

378
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:16,690
And the only ones who make it through

379
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:19,343
are the ones who take
their job so serious

380
00:17:19,534 --> 00:17:21,644
that they put everything else aside.

381
00:17:31,026 --> 00:17:33,635
On your toes, Boot. These
guys are armed for war.

382
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,149
Early-warning system.

383
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:54,739
You just happened to have that on you?

384
00:17:54,764 --> 00:17:55,894
Of course not.

385
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:58,002
My dad taught me to carry dog biscuits.

386
00:17:58,155 --> 00:17:59,250
Thought he was pulling my leg,

387
00:17:59,275 --> 00:18:01,170
but that just worked like gangbusters.

388
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:07,303
Police!

389
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:10,981
Let's go, Boot!

390
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,221
What's wrong? Are you hit?

391
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:20,969
Clear!

392
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:22,917
- Through the yard!
- Clear here!

393
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,765
Two down inside. You guys okay?

394
00:18:31,428 --> 00:18:32,735
Yeah.

395
00:18:42,616 --> 00:18:44,509
So, uh, did you have a quinceañera?

396
00:18:44,596 --> 00:18:46,219
Of course, and I looked good.

397
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,859
Who did you dance with?
'Cause you said single mom.

398
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:50,582
My abuelo.

399
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:51,935
- Her dad.
- Oh.

400
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,022
He made me laugh the whole time.

401
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,113
My mom was pissed.

402
00:18:57,209 --> 00:18:58,744
Lopez!

403
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:00,686
Give us a minute.

404
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:02,278
- Why? What's going on?
- Just do it.

405
00:19:08,132 --> 00:19:09,754
The hell were you thinking
letting me hit the streets

406
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:11,393
- with a broken rookie?
- He's not broken.

407
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:13,785
He froze when the
bullets started flying.

408
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:15,464
You gonna tell me the same
thing didn't happen with you

409
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,088
the day I got shot?

410
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,465
I thought I helped him get past it.

411
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,827
Well, you didn't. Now he's my problem.

412
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:22,717
Not for long.

413
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:25,028
Any idea what that's about?

414
00:19:25,891 --> 00:19:27,125
Me.

415
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,635
What happened?

416
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:31,272
I think I'm done.

417
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:33,229
- What?
- Yeah.

418
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:36,026
I froze up when the shooting started.

419
00:19:36,783 --> 00:19:39,078
Same thing happened at
the Selby shootout,

420
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:41,432
but Lopez covered for me, so...

421
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,641
Look... I don't know how to fix it.

422
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:47,559
I have to fix it.

423
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,454
I lied to Andersen to cover for the kid.

424
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,995
If you out him, my career is over, too.

425
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:54,379
Well, that was stupid.

426
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,041
All right, look.

427
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:03,476
I know just the neighborhood
to take him to.

428
00:20:03,697 --> 00:20:05,306
He'll self-destruct by
the end of the day,

429
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:06,932
I'll catch him on my
body cam, he'll be done.

430
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,017
No one will know about you.

431
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:09,990
His father's a commander
at internal affairs...

432
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:11,436
I don't care. Boot's a menace...

433
00:20:11,472 --> 00:20:13,306
This is exactly why I didn't tell you.

434
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:14,811
You think Jackson's
father won't blame you

435
00:20:14,835 --> 00:20:15,930
for the kid's failure?

436
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,857
This is political whether
you like it or not.

437
00:20:17,904 --> 00:20:19,438
- What do we do?
- Leave him on the streets?

438
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:20,597
Hope he doesn't get you killed?

439
00:20:20,642 --> 00:20:21,709
No.

440
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:25,705
I don't know.

441
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:28,340
He could be a good cop, h-he's smart.

442
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,519
He has instincts you can't teach.

443
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:30,607
There's potential.

444
00:20:30,632 --> 00:20:31,720
Screw potential.

445
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:32,987
Tim.

446
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:34,864
What are you gonna do?

447
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,250
I don't know.

448
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:40,383
Listen, you're gonna
make it through this, okay?

449
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:42,109
Lucy and I are gonna help you.

450
00:20:42,363 --> 00:20:43,713
How?

451
00:20:44,178 --> 00:20:45,545
Walk away, Boot.

452
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:47,022
- Officer Bradford...
- I gave you an order.

453
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,449
Listen to me. He's worth fighting for.

454
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,127
You and Lopez both know it.

455
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,295
<i>7-Adam-15,</i>

456
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,621
<i>female juvenile reports</i>

457
00:20:58,646 --> 00:20:59,913
<i>being held against her will.</i>

458
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:02,316
<i>Owens and Arlington. Code 3.</i>

459
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:07,503
What's going on?

460
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:08,598
We got a call. Young girl said

461
00:21:08,623 --> 00:21:10,407
she was being held captive
at this location.

462
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:13,119
Are you kidding me? Sarah's
holding <i>us</i> hostage.

463
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:14,268
We're bleeding money every minute

464
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,384
she won't come out of the trailer.

465
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:16,542
We need to see her.

466
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:24,757
LAPD. Open up.

467
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:30,963
Am I in trouble?

468
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:33,536
- Are you being held hostage?
- No.

469
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:37,108
Then yeah, filing a false police
report is kind of a crime.

470
00:21:38,257 --> 00:21:39,372
I'm sorry.

471
00:21:39,397 --> 00:21:41,007
I-I didn't know what else to do.

472
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:42,602
I don't want to be here anymore.

473
00:21:42,648 --> 00:21:43,809
I hate it.

474
00:21:43,834 --> 00:21:45,364
Is someone making you?

475
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:46,827
My foster mom.

476
00:21:46,852 --> 00:21:47,954
She's an agent.

477
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:49,211
She's been putting me up for things

478
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:50,898
ever since I was placed with her.

479
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:53,073
I just want to be back with my real mom,

480
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,816
but Alice won't even let me talk to her.

481
00:21:57,003 --> 00:21:59,748
Sarah, are you okay? W-What happened?

482
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:01,086
Let's talk over here.

483
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,368
Wh...

484
00:22:02,957 --> 00:22:05,837
I... I don't understand.

485
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,537
- Is something wrong?
- She says you're making her do this.

486
00:22:08,575 --> 00:22:09,808
That's ridiculous.

487
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:11,652
She agreed to try it.

488
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,908
I-I'm just trying to teach her

489
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:15,046
a sense of responsibility
and a work ethic.

490
00:22:15,123 --> 00:22:16,832
I do that for all the kids I foster.

491
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:19,225
Sarah also said you're keeping
her from her birth mother.

492
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:23,277
Her birth mother is an alcoholic
who just got out of prison.

493
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,638
She's in no position
to care for that girl.

494
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,147
All right, give your
information to Officer Chen.

495
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:30,070
We'll follow up with the state.

496
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,592
Right.

497
00:22:34,741 --> 00:22:35,860
Here's my card.

498
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:37,039
If you have a real problem,

499
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,279
give me a call.

500
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:39,905
Thanks.

501
00:22:44,173 --> 00:22:46,291
Guess you were right
about cops and secrets.

502
00:22:46,861 --> 00:22:48,438
Yeah, I should've taken my own advice.

503
00:22:48,463 --> 00:22:50,253
For what it's worth, you
covering for Jackson

504
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:52,126
was a stand-up thing to do.

505
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:53,954
It was selfish, not noble.

506
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,620
I did it to protect myself.

507
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,001
Sir.

508
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,366
I am more committed to this job

509
00:23:02,391 --> 00:23:04,192
than anyone you've ever trained.

510
00:23:04,379 --> 00:23:05,773
I'm gonna get past this.

511
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:07,773
We ain't playing dress-up here, Boot.

512
00:23:08,817 --> 00:23:10,370
So, what's the plan?

513
00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:12,267
Out me to Andersen?

514
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:14,026
Drop me off in gang territory?

515
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:15,643
What, public execution?

516
00:23:17,053 --> 00:23:20,813
All that I'm asking is
that you try and fix me...

517
00:23:23,572 --> 00:23:26,107
...instead of just throwing me away.

518
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:28,997
I don't do lost causes.

519
00:23:30,198 --> 00:23:32,757
Now, if I were you, I'd
prepare for tomorrow

520
00:23:32,782 --> 00:23:34,791
to be your last day on the job.

521
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,660
Hey Jackson, it's me, again, um...

522
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,173
Just calling to see if you're
all right, buddy, just...

523
00:23:48,663 --> 00:23:50,202
call me back, all right?

524
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:51,303
Bye.

525
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:53,691
Did you get him?

526
00:23:53,716 --> 00:23:55,517
No. Uh, left another message.

527
00:23:55,582 --> 00:23:57,929
Hmm.

528
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:00,273
Tim won't throw Jackson under the bus.

529
00:24:00,513 --> 00:24:01,646
How can you even say that?

530
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:03,198
All the guy does is torture you.

531
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:07,357
He's calculating, not cruel.

532
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:10,034
Plus, he's got a massive ego.

533
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,701
He'll probably take it as a challenge

534
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:13,469
to his abilities as a T.O.

535
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,920
I hope you're right.

536
00:24:16,918 --> 00:24:18,450
Um...

537
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:20,678
I have something to tell you.

538
00:24:24,732 --> 00:24:26,294
Talia knows about us.

539
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:29,262
She told me on day 2,

540
00:24:29,631 --> 00:24:32,466
said it would be a mistake
to keep dating you.

541
00:24:38,766 --> 00:24:40,366
Okay, um...

542
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:44,673
Okay, first off, what
business is that of hers?

543
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:46,699
And second, why would you
wait so long to tell me?

544
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:49,978
I didn't want to screw this up.

545
00:24:50,311 --> 00:24:53,997
And I didn't want you to
confront her and get fired.

546
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,629
Oh.

547
00:24:56,885 --> 00:24:59,721
Look. Talia won't tell anyone,

548
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:03,183
and we'll just make sure
nobody else finds out.

549
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:05,167
Okay?

550
00:25:06,068 --> 00:25:07,335
Okay.

551
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,084
So, are you gonna tell me my fate,

552
00:25:14,108 --> 00:25:16,452
or are you just gonna
torture me all morning?

553
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:18,952
You really in a hurry to find out?

554
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:21,548
No.

555
00:25:22,918 --> 00:25:24,341
Who is it?

556
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:25,842
Officer Bradford.

557
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,253
I.D.

558
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,314
You're looking at us through
the peephole, Wallace.

559
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:34,993
Just open up.

560
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,571
- Who's he?
- Who are you?

561
00:25:42,805 --> 00:25:44,163
My new Boot.

562
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:45,930
Have you been out of the
apartment recently?

563
00:25:45,968 --> 00:25:47,460
The downstairs buzzer's broken.

564
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:49,484
Can you fix it for me?

565
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:51,310
Fix it yourself.

566
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:53,403
I'll be in the car.

567
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:55,343
What... What am I supposed to do?

568
00:25:56,999 --> 00:25:58,724
Talk to Wallace.

569
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,754
Can I come in?

570
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,094
No.

571
00:26:08,364 --> 00:26:09,731
Okay, look, I...

572
00:26:12,815 --> 00:26:14,750
I told Nolan.

573
00:26:15,892 --> 00:26:17,560
Told him what?

574
00:26:17,607 --> 00:26:19,462
Not what you want me to tell him,

575
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:21,568
but that you know.

576
00:26:22,406 --> 00:26:23,925
Bishop.

577
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:26,198
Got a little girl looking for you.

578
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:29,068
Says she's following up on the
911 call you took yesterday.

579
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,693
Is that the foster kid?

580
00:26:31,027 --> 00:26:32,513
Sarah, yeah.

581
00:26:32,597 --> 00:26:33,944
Wait in the shop.

582
00:26:37,301 --> 00:26:38,268
Come on.

583
00:26:39,285 --> 00:26:41,228
Sir? Wallace.

584
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:45,401
Dude, my T.O. says talk to you.

585
00:26:45,483 --> 00:26:47,717
Okay? So I got to talk to you.

586
00:26:50,695 --> 00:26:53,436
Look, I'm not going away,
so just let me in.

587
00:26:54,132 --> 00:26:55,627
Please.

588
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:15,575
So, how do you, uh,
know Officer Bradford?

589
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:17,841
We used to date.

590
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:22,725
You should see the look on your face.

591
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:26,590
No, uh, a few years
ago, I was hate-crimed.

592
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:29,012
Tim went with me
to the hospital, and...

593
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,441
I haven't been able to
get rid of him since.

594
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:38,015
You're a big traveler.

595
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:39,918
I used to be.

596
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,396
Don't go out much anymore?

597
00:27:41,455 --> 00:27:44,733
Being outside is overrated.

598
00:27:47,414 --> 00:27:49,115
I talked to my mom last night.

599
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:51,106
She said she wanted me back.

600
00:27:51,591 --> 00:27:54,527
But Alice is blocking her.

601
00:27:54,694 --> 00:27:56,194
It's not her call, Sarah.

602
00:27:56,236 --> 00:27:58,671
I spoke with social
services this morning.

603
00:27:58,792 --> 00:28:01,015
Your mom just did six
months for a hit and run.

604
00:28:01,085 --> 00:28:02,581
She's clean now.

605
00:28:02,615 --> 00:28:03,715
She told me.

606
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,140
I hope so.

607
00:28:05,185 --> 00:28:06,919
But she's gonna have
to sustain it a while

608
00:28:06,944 --> 00:28:08,259
before they put you back with her.

609
00:28:08,284 --> 00:28:10,472
You're just like the rest of them.

610
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:11,851
Sit down.

611
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:19,720
I grew up in the system...

612
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,408
four foster families by
the time I was your age,

613
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,828
each of them worse than
where you are now.

614
00:28:25,252 --> 00:28:27,545
At first, I was angry all the time.

615
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,244
It was unfair, you know?

616
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:31,785
Every other kid got to
have a happy childhood.

617
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,514
But you got to get past that.

618
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:36,639
You've been placed in a
good home with a foster mom

619
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:38,408
who's trying to help you be independent,

620
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:41,543
teach you a skill so you don't
have to rely on anyone.

621
00:28:42,752 --> 00:28:44,653
The sooner you stop feeling
sorry for yourself

622
00:28:44,678 --> 00:28:46,479
and do what has to be done,

623
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,863
<i>the better off you'll be.</i>

624
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:54,575
I haven't left this
apartment in 15 months.

625
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,997
I tried at first, when I got
home from the hospital.

626
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:01,832
I even made it downstairs a few times.

627
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,791
That was over a year ago.

628
00:29:03,905 --> 00:29:05,715
What happens when you try to leave?

629
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:09,439
Have you ever been on fire and
underwater at the same time?

630
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:11,916
Yeah. Yesterday.

631
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:16,116
Turns out I have a thing
about being shot at.

632
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:19,675
And if I don't get past it, I'm done.

633
00:29:19,802 --> 00:29:23,137
Look... I'm hardly the
person to give advice,

634
00:29:23,325 --> 00:29:24,934
but if you're gonna conquer this,

635
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:26,629
you've got to do it now.

636
00:29:26,875 --> 00:29:30,315
If I'd only forced myself to
go outside on the first day,

637
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:33,253
I wouldn't be trapped in here.

638
00:29:35,678 --> 00:29:37,215
Lopez, Nolan.

639
00:29:37,385 --> 00:29:38,908
You wanted to see us?

640
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,114
The quinceañera felon

641
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:41,993
you picked up yesterday, Nestor Garcia?

642
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:43,435
He's requested to speak with you both.

643
00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:44,568
Why?

644
00:29:44,593 --> 00:29:45,990
A.D.A. thinks it's
connected to a plea deal

645
00:29:46,014 --> 00:29:47,397
he's trying to cut.

646
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:50,004
She's bringing him in
from the courthouse now.

647
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:51,672
You let me know how it goes.

648
00:29:51,994 --> 00:29:53,161
Yes, ma'am.

649
00:29:55,023 --> 00:29:56,618
I want to thank you for yesterday.

650
00:29:56,732 --> 00:29:58,366
That dance meant a lot to my daughter,

651
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,394
and the fact that you let me finish,

652
00:30:00,422 --> 00:30:01,656
that means a lot to me.

653
00:30:03,933 --> 00:30:06,999
So, to reward you, I have a gift.

654
00:30:07,502 --> 00:30:09,537
A drug deal is going
down this afternoon...

655
00:30:09,562 --> 00:30:10,896
large shipment,

656
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,184
the kind of bust that'll
get you noticed.

657
00:30:13,595 --> 00:30:16,296
And you're just giving us this
because we were nice to you?

658
00:30:16,371 --> 00:30:18,318
No, I'm doing this to
reduce my sentence.

659
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:21,233
But I'm giving it to <i>you
because you were nice to me.</i>

660
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:25,143
So, you'd better hurry up, call the D.A.
to make a deal,

661
00:30:25,173 --> 00:30:28,984
because the exchange is
going down in two hours.

662
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:37,702
Okay, according to Garcia,

663
00:30:37,795 --> 00:30:40,964
the exchange is going down at
Stoneson Home Supply on Sunset.

664
00:30:41,031 --> 00:30:42,432
W... They're gonna make a drug deal

665
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,684
in the parking lot in broad daylight?

666
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:46,252
Box stores are the perfect cover.

667
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:48,318
Busy parking lots, multiple exits.

668
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:50,373
They hide in the chaos.

669
00:30:50,489 --> 00:30:53,981
At 1500 hours, a car loaded
with 80 kilos of cocaine

670
00:30:54,006 --> 00:30:56,702
driven up from Mexico will
land in the parking lot.

671
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:58,530
The driver will walk away.

672
00:30:58,637 --> 00:30:59,916
A runner for the buyer

673
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,032
will climb behind the
wheel and drive off.

674
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:03,705
The whole thing takes 90 seconds.

675
00:31:03,762 --> 00:31:05,658
According to Nestor, the
shipment is in a red Civic

676
00:31:05,683 --> 00:31:06,944
with Nevada plates.

677
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:10,700
Now, the parking lot only
has two access points...

678
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:12,987
here and here.

679
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,734
Officer Bradford, you'll be
parked out of sight over there.

680
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,056
Officer Bishop, you'll have
all eyes on this exit here.

681
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,765
And what about us, Sergeant?
What's our position?

682
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:23,113
We need to know exactly
when the car lands,

683
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:25,590
so we need eyes on the
whole parking lot.

684
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,249
You will be with me here.

685
00:31:36,888 --> 00:31:38,522
License and registration?

686
00:31:38,603 --> 00:31:40,808
This ain't dinner theater. Relax.

687
00:31:49,304 --> 00:31:51,371
I think I see our welcoming party.

688
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:54,218
A Ram, three Hispanics inside,

689
00:31:54,243 --> 00:31:55,650
heads on a swivel.

690
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:01,280
No sign of our red Civic yet.

691
00:32:01,364 --> 00:32:02,931
Stand by.

692
00:32:03,268 --> 00:32:04,936
Copy that.

693
00:32:07,073 --> 00:32:08,617
Thanks.

694
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:11,887
For, uh, not outing me to Grey.

695
00:32:13,907 --> 00:32:15,801
I had a good talk with Wallace.

696
00:32:17,536 --> 00:32:18,978
Great.

697
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,779
Can you promise me you're cured?

698
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:23,816
Of course not.

699
00:32:23,917 --> 00:32:25,540
Then if things go sideways on this bust,

700
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:27,118
you do not get out of this shop.

701
00:32:27,143 --> 00:32:28,744
- Do you understand?
- Sir...

702
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:30,526
Look, the only answer here is "yes."

703
00:32:30,864 --> 00:32:32,241
I cannot rely on you to have my back,

704
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:34,568
and I will not have
your death on my head.

705
00:32:34,881 --> 00:32:36,284
Got it?

706
00:32:38,992 --> 00:32:40,278
Yes, sir.

707
00:32:48,352 --> 00:32:50,587
I... I really like him.

708
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:56,112
I've never been serious
about anyone before,

709
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:57,538
and I'm playing it casual,

710
00:32:57,563 --> 00:32:59,659
but the thought of ending it, I...

711
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:02,465
I don't want to.

712
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:05,705
But then I heard you tell Sarah

713
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,079
to stop feeling sorry for herself,

714
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:10,203
and to just, you know, make
peace with her situation,

715
00:33:10,274 --> 00:33:12,865
and I realized I can't just
run from a hard decision.

716
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,091
I have to face it head-on...

717
00:33:15,116 --> 00:33:17,384
I'm sorry. How exactly
did you hear that?

718
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:22,719
I might have wandered into observation

719
00:33:22,744 --> 00:33:24,811
while you were talking to her. I...

720
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:27,580
Sorry.

721
00:33:27,832 --> 00:33:30,813
Look, I appreciate you being
honest with me about Nolan.

722
00:33:31,322 --> 00:33:32,746
More importantly, I think you're finally

723
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:34,271
being honest with yourself.

724
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,879
That's all I was looking to provoke...

725
00:33:38,503 --> 00:33:40,190
an informed choice.

726
00:33:40,658 --> 00:33:42,209
Here we go.

727
00:33:42,306 --> 00:33:45,137
Red Civic, Nevada plates,
entering parking lot.

728
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:18,763
Go, go, go!

729
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:42,427
7-Adam-15, going after the red Civic.

730
00:34:50,669 --> 00:34:52,110
Aah!

731
00:34:52,866 --> 00:34:54,397
Ma'am! Stay down!

732
00:34:56,716 --> 00:34:58,416
Stay in the car.

733
00:35:03,823 --> 00:35:04,920
I'm opened up!

734
00:35:04,945 --> 00:35:06,568
Let's go! I got you!

735
00:35:08,047 --> 00:35:09,695
Stay down!

736
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,011
I got you.

737
00:36:04,589 --> 00:36:05,786
I can make it. I can get in there.

738
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:07,591
- For reload!
- I got you!

739
00:36:08,927 --> 00:36:10,414
- Ready?
- Yeah.

740
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,727
Got you.

741
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,890
One suspect in custody.

742
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:52,432
7-Adam-15, in pursuit of red Civic

743
00:36:52,457 --> 00:36:53,624
heading east on Chapman.

744
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:05,438
That is a lot of coke.

745
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,894
Yo. Yo, yo, yo, yo. You call an Uber?

746
00:37:12,448 --> 00:37:15,016
I'll understand if you
don't give me a five star.

747
00:37:16,524 --> 00:37:19,091
The moment of truth is upon us.

748
00:37:19,746 --> 00:37:21,492
End of shift.

749
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:24,110
Time to come clean.

750
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:26,973
What did you learn about your T.O.s?

751
00:37:28,342 --> 00:37:29,876
Officer West.

752
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:33,209
Sorry, sir.

753
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:36,162
I was unable to gain any
insight into Officer Bradford.

754
00:37:37,758 --> 00:37:39,334
That's disappointing.

755
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:42,346
Officer Chen?

756
00:37:42,489 --> 00:37:44,688
I, too, failed in. my
assignment, Sergeant.

757
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:47,285
All right.

758
00:37:47,562 --> 00:37:50,322
All right, that leaves
you, Officer Nolan.

759
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:54,027
You can literally say
anything and win the contest.

760
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,891
Sorry, sir. Just as
stumped as the others.

761
00:37:57,812 --> 00:38:01,061
Okay, fine.

762
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:03,697
So no one wants extra credit.

763
00:38:04,285 --> 00:38:06,632
I guess we'll start at the basics.

764
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,670
Tomorrow morning, you will have a quiz

765
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,461
on your rook books.

766
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:12,941
Study hard,

767
00:38:12,986 --> 00:38:17,442
'cause 80 percent is
considered a fail in my house.

768
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,337
Dismissed.

769
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,672
Looks like I fixed your rookie for you.

770
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:27,686
Thanks.

771
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:29,186
And I didn't get you anything.

772
00:38:29,298 --> 00:38:31,918
The only thing I need is for
you not to lie to me again.

773
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:39,737
In the future, I'd appreciate it

774
00:38:39,762 --> 00:38:41,435
if you stayed away
from my personal life.

775
00:38:41,491 --> 00:38:43,859
- Boot, this wasn't about you.
- The hell it wasn't.

776
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:46,014
My relationship with Lucy is not a game.

777
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:48,286
- I care about her.
- Really?

778
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:51,265
'Cause when this gets
out, and it will get out,

779
00:38:51,507 --> 00:38:54,282
it'll brand her for the
rest of her career.

780
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:56,260
So, if you care about her
like you say you do,

781
00:38:56,285 --> 00:38:58,187
you wouldn't even put
her in this position.

782
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:17,339
- Hey.
- Hey. Uh...

783
00:39:17,364 --> 00:39:19,042
I need to...

784
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:24,016
- Can I go first?
- Uh...

785
00:39:24,287 --> 00:39:26,267
Yeah, sure.

786
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:33,685
When I first met you, I
had just turned my life

787
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,121
upside down, and I was...

788
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:38,387
I-I was lost.

789
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:41,869
I was alone, everything was alien to me.

790
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,630
But then you turned me
right-side up again,

791
00:39:44,821 --> 00:39:46,025
and you gave me the confidence

792
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,423
not just to endure the challenges,

793
00:39:47,448 --> 00:39:50,376
but to actually enjoy them,
and I'm so grateful for that.

794
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:53,211
And now that we're here,
I just don't think...

795
00:39:53,336 --> 00:39:55,139
Um...

796
00:39:55,472 --> 00:39:57,440
Are you breaking up with me?

797
00:39:59,643 --> 00:40:01,004
Yeah, Lucy, I am.

798
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:03,030
Mm, because, uh,

799
00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:04,781
I was gonna break up with you.

800
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:06,560
Then why are you mad?

801
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,779
I have been struggling with
this decision for weeks

802
00:40:10,127 --> 00:40:12,969
because I really like you.

803
00:40:13,284 --> 00:40:14,751
And you just ripped off the Band-Aid

804
00:40:14,776 --> 00:40:15,943
like it was no big deal.

805
00:40:15,968 --> 00:40:17,522
Of course it's a big deal.

806
00:40:17,547 --> 00:40:18,687
I don't want to do this.

807
00:40:18,712 --> 00:40:20,446
But I can't be the reason you fail.

808
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:22,247
Oh, so you're protecting yourself?

809
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,407
No, I'm trying to put
myself in your shoes.

810
00:40:24,432 --> 00:40:26,565
You'll never be in my shoes.

811
00:40:26,737 --> 00:40:29,372
And you'll never know
how unfair that is.

812
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:36,402
You're right.

813
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:39,535
You're right, and I'm sorry.

814
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:46,459
I joined the Academy on a whim.

815
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,978
I knew that my parents would hate it.

816
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:52,093
But I had no idea how
much I would love it.

817
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:57,114
Being a cop is the first thing
I've ever been serious about.

818
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,122
And you...

819
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,192
You were the second.

820
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:03,850
- Lucy...
- Don't. Don't.

821
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:08,779
Yeah, yeah. It's better this way, so...

822
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:12,902
I will see you at work.
