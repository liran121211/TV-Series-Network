1
00:00:01,453 --> 00:00:04,828
At 11:15 this morning,
the LAPD engaged in a pursuit

2
00:00:04,853 --> 00:00:07,121
of Number One
on the FBI's Most Wanted list.

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,580
All departmental resources
were brought to bear

4
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,469
on this dangerous fugitive,

5
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:25,733
including our most decorated
officer, Kaydence Patton.

6
00:00:35,379 --> 00:00:38,062
On your knees, dirt bag.
Hands behind your back.

7
00:00:38,876 --> 00:00:40,427
Dirt bag?

8
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:41,726
Ow!

9
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:03,963
On behalf of Make-A-Wish,

10
00:01:03,988 --> 00:01:05,555
the City of Los Angeles, and the LAPD,

11
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,770
we hereby thank,

12
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:09,582
Honorary Police Officer
Kaydence Patton.

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,993
<i>Considered one of the
ocean's greatest predators,</i>

14
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:27,282
<i>the great white is a solitary creature.</i>

15
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:28,631
<i>Always on the hunt,</i>

16
00:01:28,656 --> 00:01:32,359
<i>the shark glides through
icy depths and coastal wat...</i>

17
00:01:32,632 --> 00:01:34,189
So, just to be clear,

18
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:36,002
since I left you three days ago,

19
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:37,367
I flew to New York,

20
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:38,402
went to a board meeting,

21
00:01:38,436 --> 00:01:39,725
two Broadway shows,

22
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,083
a charity gala,

23
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:43,319
and you haven't moved.

24
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:45,035
Moving is overrated.

25
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:47,663
Huh. You said you had plans. Right?

26
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:49,933
Too many to come to New York with me.

27
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:51,734
Yeah, I lied about that.

28
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:53,901
And you told me to embrace
being on my own.

29
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:55,498
I didn't mean become a hermit.

30
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:57,769
You need to put yourself
out there, meet new people.

31
00:01:57,835 --> 00:01:59,436
I do. I meet dozens of new people,

32
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,757
every day on patrol.

33
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:02,354
And you arrest them.

34
00:02:02,504 --> 00:02:05,615
Speaking of, I have got to get to work.

35
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:06,938
I'm just trying to look out for you.

36
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:08,297
I know, and... and I appreciate it.

37
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:10,991
I just... I'm not feeling
really social right now.

38
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:12,891
How many times you check
Lucy's Instagram page?

39
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:14,103
None.

40
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:17,674
11.

41
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:20,824
John, L.A. is full of distractions.

42
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:22,178
Find yourself one.

43
00:02:22,286 --> 00:02:24,253
'Cause Lucy's not going anywhere.

44
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:26,149
You need to move on.

45
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:33,765
What?

46
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:35,091
- Morning.
- Hey.

47
00:02:35,206 --> 00:02:36,418
Where were you this weekend?

48
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:37,537
We, uh, hit up a Dodger game

49
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:39,450
and went to that pop-up karaoke disco.

50
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,191
Uh, my back was bothering me,

51
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:43,250
so I just stayed home
to take care of it.

52
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:44,988
Well, cowboy up next time,

53
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:46,312
'cause we can't be the Three Amigos

54
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:48,270
with just two people. Right?

55
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:49,876
Yeah, totally.

56
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,450
All right, grab your seats.

57
00:02:53,324 --> 00:02:55,674
A special day here at Mid-Wilshire.

58
00:02:56,086 --> 00:02:58,688
In fact, we're gonna start off
by playing a game I like to call:

59
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:01,625
"What is a patrol officer's
least favorite assignment?"

60
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:03,739
Officer Lopez,
why don't you get us started.

61
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:05,369
Easy. Guarding a dead body.

62
00:03:05,502 --> 00:03:07,770
Solid one. Officer Bradford?

63
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:09,379
Canvassing in the rain.

64
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:10,792
Bishop.

65
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:13,452
Driving the drunk wagon.
It's just nasty.

66
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:14,817
Without a doubt.

67
00:03:15,342 --> 00:03:17,545
And yet, for me,

68
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:19,816
the absolute worst is...

69
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:23,066
the VIP ride along.

70
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:26,580
Why? That sounds like fun.

71
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:29,017
Officer Bishop, would you like
to inform your Boot

72
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,990
why the ride along tops my list?

73
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:34,945
Because if anything happens
to your VIP, it's your ass.

74
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:37,213
So, you take the lowest
of low-risk calls.

75
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:39,703
It makes a 12-hour shift
feel twice as long.

76
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:41,340
Plus, you're trapped in a car all day

77
00:03:41,365 --> 00:03:44,133
with an entitled prima donna
coated in body spray.

78
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:45,822
Officer Nolan,

79
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:48,391
you want to take a guess
why we're playing this game?

80
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:50,666
Because you're giving me
the VIP ride along?

81
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:52,431
- No.
- Really?

82
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:54,324
No. You absolutely got the ride along.

83
00:03:56,366 --> 00:03:58,935
He's waiting in the Captain's
office for you now.

84
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,210
Sir, is it too late
to ask for a sick day?

85
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:03,708
- Yes, it is.
- Uh, who is this VIP, anyway?

86
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:05,319
Thank you so much

87
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:07,311
- for allowing this.
- Of course.

88
00:04:07,358 --> 00:04:09,635
LAPD always appreciates when
Hollywood gets it right.

89
00:04:09,694 --> 00:04:12,062
Ah, no danger of that with me, huh?

90
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,187
No, I-I'm just moving this movie
franchise of mine

91
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:17,429
from New York to L.A.,

92
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:19,055
so I thought I should
get out on the street here,

93
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,851
see how L.A.'s finest get things done.

94
00:04:20,898 --> 00:04:21,966
What movie is that?

95
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:23,125
It's "Trading Fire."

96
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,036
And if Five is half as good as Four,

97
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:26,312
I will be a happy man.

98
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,278
Mr. Payne, meet Officers
Talia Bishop and John Nolan.

99
00:04:29,318 --> 00:04:30,453
You'll be riding with them today.

100
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,992
- It's a pleasure.
- I am such a huge fan.

101
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:35,057
Oh, I'm so excited to be riding along

102
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:37,167
with the oldest rookie in the world.

103
00:04:37,334 --> 00:04:38,999
I don't... uh, well,
I wouldn't say world.

104
00:04:39,024 --> 00:04:41,423
- Don't sell yourself short, James.
- John.

105
00:04:41,487 --> 00:04:42,832
Captain, once again,

106
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:44,435
thank you so much for allowing this.

107
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:45,957
I know the rules of the ride along.

108
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:48,384
I'll be happy with whatever
level of calls you give us.

109
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:50,007
I appreciate that,
but we will make sure

110
00:04:50,032 --> 00:04:51,353
that you get to see some action.

111
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:54,002
Great. Great.

112
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:58,174
He does not get anywhere <i>near</i> danger.

113
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,489
Is that understood?

114
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,960
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:07,023
It is such an honor to be the one...

116
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:08,921
So, what's it gonna cost me

117
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:10,745
to get to see some real action, huh?

118
00:05:11,075 --> 00:05:14,310
And don't forget I have what
they call "stupid money."

119
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:15,887
If you don't put that away,
this ride along

120
00:05:15,912 --> 00:05:17,813
is gonna be over before it even starts.

121
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,137
Tough negotiator, huh?

122
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:23,877
She's not negotiating.

123
00:05:25,216 --> 00:05:27,496
- I heard a rumor.
- About what?

124
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:29,917
My dad said a detective position
is opening up,

125
00:05:29,942 --> 00:05:32,143
and you and Talia are top contenders.

126
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,165
So, I would keep an eye out
for The Tap.

127
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:36,858
What do you know about The Tap?

128
00:05:36,954 --> 00:05:38,210
It's how the higher-ups signal

129
00:05:38,235 --> 00:05:39,917
that you're a shoo-in for detective.

130
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,321
"Officer, you should think about
taking the exam."

131
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:43,786
Wink, wink.

132
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:46,261
I am so ready to move up.

133
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:48,255
Did your dad say anything else?

134
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,947
Anything I can use
to get a leg up over Talia?

135
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:53,247
No. Mnh-mnh.

136
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,099
Listen, I really shouldn't
have told you that.

137
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,241
Don't worry. I won't say anything.

138
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:00,569
But I definitely appreciate
the heads up.

139
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:05,563
<i>7-Adam-7, reporting
a possible assault in progress.</i>

140
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:10,256
Sounds like someone's getting killed.

141
00:06:10,347 --> 00:06:11,514
Police! Open up!

142
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,776
- What the hell are you doing?
- Nothing.

143
00:06:20,865 --> 00:06:23,033
- Uh, no, I've...
- I've heard of this before.

144
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,982
Did you shock yourself so you
can feel an adrenaline rush?

145
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:27,325
Dude, y-you should try it.

146
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,583
It really just clears the sinuses.

147
00:06:29,714 --> 00:06:31,448
Where did all this stuff come from?

148
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,964
The Jason bought it from a friend.

149
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:36,501
Really? And where exactly
does your friend work?

150
00:06:37,274 --> 00:06:40,282
The... hospital store.

151
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:43,416
Okay.

152
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:45,909
Look, The Jason is gonna
put on The Handcuffs,

153
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,780
because he's under arrest.

154
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:49,666
Hold up, Boot.

155
00:06:49,726 --> 00:06:51,227
We're not looking to arrest this guy.

156
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,327
We're not?

157
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,871
Not if he can point us towards
someone more worthy of jail.

158
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:57,097
How about it?

159
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:59,151
I can make the charges go away,
but to do that,

160
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:00,332
I need to know the name of the guy

161
00:07:00,357 --> 00:07:02,458
you got all this stolen equipment from.

162
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:07,999
S-Sorry.

163
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:10,808
The battery was dead, so they
had to find us another shop,

164
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,300
and then I had to put gas in it.

165
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:13,928
But we're ready to roll now, so...

166
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:15,155
You know, when I was a rookie,

167
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,521
I got here two hours before roll call

168
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:17,846
to get the best shop from motor pool,

169
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:19,373
re-wash it, and load the gear.

170
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:23,350
Is this the cop version of
walking five miles in the snow?

171
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:25,067
This isn't story time, Boot.

172
00:07:25,142 --> 00:07:27,143
I'm reminding you how easy you have it.

173
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,673
Understood, sir.

174
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:30,644
Thank you for all your support.

175
00:07:30,782 --> 00:07:33,649
Officer Bradford, Sergeant Grey
wants to see you in his office.

176
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,023
Get the shop set up.

177
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:36,573
- I'll be right back.
- Here you go.

178
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:38,801
Does this vest make me look fat?

179
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,243
What, are you kidding?

180
00:07:40,268 --> 00:07:41,431
You look like you're ready to star

181
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:42,866
in "Trading Fire Five."

182
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:46,059
Yeah, I've been training
with these special forces guys.

183
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:48,894
Oh, the same guys who trained
Tom for the last movie?

184
00:07:48,952 --> 00:07:50,686
I watch all the
behind-the-scenes videos.

185
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:51,837
<i>Wilshire units,</i>

186
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,672
<i>we have shots fired, MacArthur Park.</i>

187
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,223
Let's go to that.

188
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:58,013
Guys, let's go to that.
I've got Lakers tickets

189
00:07:58,038 --> 00:07:59,768
with your name on them if you say yes.

190
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,464
Sorry, I'm a Clippers gal.

191
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:02,879
Jonah, can you help me out, please?

192
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:05,589
Me? Um... sorry.

193
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:08,744
The T.O. dictates which calls we take.

194
00:08:08,786 --> 00:08:09,929
<i>7-Adam-15,</i>

195
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:12,888
<i>possible 459 at 910 Seabright Place.</i>

196
00:08:12,913 --> 00:08:14,130
What's a 459?

197
00:08:14,165 --> 00:08:15,588
7-Adam-15 responding.

198
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:16,674
What's a 459?

199
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,129
Real, authentic police work.

200
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:20,676
Yeah.

201
00:08:22,328 --> 00:08:23,840
Come in.

202
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,751
That's not a good sign.

203
00:08:29,246 --> 00:08:31,016
No, it's not.

204
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:33,940
Look, there's no easy way to say this.

205
00:08:34,545 --> 00:08:37,213
I was just notified that
detectives made a drug bust.

206
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:39,348
I recognized the suspect's name.

207
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:40,992
It's your wife.

208
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:44,634
What's the charge?

209
00:08:44,888 --> 00:08:46,632
Possession with intent to sell.

210
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:50,266
They're bringing her in?

211
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:51,628
Yeah.

212
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:54,991
I don't know all the details yet,

213
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,938
but I wanted to warn you.

214
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:59,842
So, obviously,
this is a complicated situation,

215
00:08:59,984 --> 00:09:02,880
but know that the department
has your back.

216
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:05,748
Whatever you need, just ask, okay?

217
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,730
Yes, sir.

218
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:12,454
Really? We passed up
a shoot-out for this?

219
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:15,094
Well, the neighbors reported
hearing disturbing noises.

220
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:17,087
- That could be serious.
- Huh. Doubtful.

221
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:19,391
Listen, you want to see the
difference between New York cops

222
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:21,413
- and L.A. ones, right?
- Yep.

223
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:24,540
Well, New York has 40,000
officers policing their streets.

224
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,668
L.A. only has 9,000 operating
in a city twice its size.

225
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:29,959
We see a hell of a lot more
action every shift.

226
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:32,076
Yeah, you never know when
that action's gonna happen.

227
00:09:32,142 --> 00:09:34,777
Some of these "smaller" calls
can get ugly fast.

228
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,151
Matter of fact, just to be safe,

229
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,144
you should really just hang back.

230
00:09:38,322 --> 00:09:40,056
To be safe.

231
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,509
- LAPD!
- Police!

232
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,234
Bishop.

233
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:07,463
LAPD. Show me your hands.

234
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:18,378
Oh, she's been there a while.

235
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:20,158
And no one noticed.

236
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,124
Hey, what's, uh... what's going on?

237
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,050
What did Grey want?

238
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:35,324
Are we going out?

239
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:47,100
Detectives.

240
00:10:47,224 --> 00:10:49,125
After you drop off,
can you come back and see me?

241
00:10:49,653 --> 00:10:51,872
Thanks.

242
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,386
Hey.

243
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:05,351
You have an issue with our arrest?

244
00:11:05,594 --> 00:11:07,562
No, just looking for more
details on this one.

245
00:11:07,656 --> 00:11:09,491
We assisted on a DEA task force,

246
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:11,432
tracking a heroin distribution network.

247
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:13,827
They flagged a car known
to make drops for them.

248
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,119
We pulled over the suspect
and found four grams,

249
00:11:16,144 --> 00:11:17,277
individually wrapped,

250
00:11:17,337 --> 00:11:18,666
which means intent to sell.

251
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:21,002
- Isabel isn't a dealer.
- How do you know?

252
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:23,304
Officer Bradford and Isabel
were rookies together.

253
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:24,506
So she's a cop?

254
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:26,107
Was.

255
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:28,076
Undercover narcotics. Another division.

256
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,098
Been off the job for a year.

257
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,497
You used to date.

258
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:34,350
She's my wife.

259
00:11:34,517 --> 00:11:37,018
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

260
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:38,820
Fact of the matter is
she's in pretty deep

261
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:40,522
with some heavy dealers.

262
00:11:40,777 --> 00:11:42,175
Being arrested
with that kind of weight,

263
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,825
she's looking at
one to three in county.

264
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:45,660
I know that,
but she doesn't even own a car.

265
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,084
You bother to check the registration?

266
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:49,131
Doesn't matter.
She was the one driving.

267
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:51,533
Look, this is not something
that we can make go away...

268
00:11:51,865 --> 00:11:53,305
even if we wanted to.

269
00:11:53,551 --> 00:11:55,223
Your wife's gonna need a lawyer.

270
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,712
And your officer needs
to figure out where he stands.

271
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:00,893
Is he a cop or a suspect's husband?

272
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:03,511
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

273
00:12:15,356 --> 00:12:16,876
He's right.

274
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:19,320
Listen, why don't you take
a personal day, all right?

275
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:20,728
Make some phone calls.

276
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:23,043
It's not necessary.

277
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,732
They need to process her.

278
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,209
Then they're gonna wait
for her lawyer to show up,

279
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,467
and then they're gonna
sweat her in interrogation.

280
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,737
You won't get a chance
to talk to her for hours.

281
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:32,853
So if you don't take a day,

282
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:35,677
that means you're going back
on the street.

283
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:37,845
You have a problem with that?

284
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,548
No, sir.

285
00:12:40,849 --> 00:12:42,015
Okay.

286
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:43,729
Go back to work.

287
00:12:46,126 --> 00:12:47,822
Yeah, her name is Crawford.

288
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:49,433
Collette Crawford.

289
00:12:49,491 --> 00:12:52,659
Just looking for any relatives
or family friends.

290
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,499
Latanaprost. L-A-T-A-N-A-P-R-O-S-T.

291
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:58,499
Could you check again?
Uh, there has to be somebody.

292
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,409
Hey, can we go?

293
00:13:00,548 --> 00:13:02,683
Psst. Can we go?

294
00:13:03,006 --> 00:13:05,622
No, I need to get a Natural
Causes Death Certificate

295
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:06,908
issued first, and to do that,

296
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:08,152
I need to go through
all the medications

297
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:09,476
with the medical examiner.

298
00:13:09,511 --> 00:13:12,297
Well, can I just pay <i>them</i>
<i>to do it so we can go?</i>

299
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,476
No, you can't just throw money
at your problems

300
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:16,580
to make them go away.

301
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:17,972
That's not how life works.

302
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,520
Maybe not <i>your</i> life.

303
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:20,963
Nolan.

304
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,280
Uh, yeah, okay, thank you.

305
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,460
Okay, look, I-I get this
isn't exciting for you,

306
00:13:26,485 --> 00:13:27,546
but it's important,

307
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:29,427
and I know I, for one,
will sleep better tonight

308
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:32,454
knowing that we took care of Ms.
Crawford's remains personally.

309
00:13:32,668 --> 00:13:34,035
Can I give you a note?

310
00:13:34,219 --> 00:13:35,313
A what?

311
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,391
You're coming across a little earnest.

312
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:38,722
Just try throwing it away
a little more.

313
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:40,153
Throwing it...

314
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:43,211
- You do know.
- I'm a real person, right?

315
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,860
- Yeah, Nifedipine.
- God, she's just so beautiful.

316
00:13:47,082 --> 00:13:49,125
She'd never be a leading lady
today, though.

317
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:52,753
Not unless she lost 30 pounds
and had a nose job.

318
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:55,490
That's the trouble with this business.
It's so superficial.

319
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,058
Yes, well, you could buck that,
you know.

320
00:13:57,092 --> 00:13:58,826
You have the power to hire
whoever you want.

321
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:01,014
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

322
00:14:02,015 --> 00:14:05,900
But, you know, audiences expect
a certain <i>look</i> from my films.

323
00:14:05,925 --> 00:14:07,392
You know, I wouldn't want
to disappoint them.

324
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,858
Thank you.

325
00:14:09,038 --> 00:14:10,638
Yeah, well, there
is definitely a dark side

326
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:12,140
to auto-paying all your bills.

327
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:14,842
I couldn't find a single
relative or family friend

328
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:16,114
to claim the body.

329
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,811
- That's so heartbreaking.
- Doesn't surprise me.

330
00:14:20,602 --> 00:14:22,503
People forget you fast in this town.

331
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:27,822
We caught you with a van full of
stolen medical equipment.

332
00:14:27,925 --> 00:14:29,490
At least twenty grand worth,

333
00:14:29,592 --> 00:14:30,992
which makes it a major felony.

334
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:32,592
How'd you guys find out about me?

335
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:34,991
Come on!

336
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:36,841
Somebody gave me up.

337
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,236
I'm too smart to get caught
any other way.

338
00:14:39,313 --> 00:14:42,666
But are you smart enough to walk
out of this room a free man?

339
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,613
What are you doing?

340
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,941
Offering up a deal.

341
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,676
But this is a good arrest.

342
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:51,045
But there's a better one
right up the food chain.

343
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:52,780
Isn't that right, Chuy?

344
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:54,416
Maybe.

345
00:14:54,503 --> 00:14:57,581
Make that a "yes," you might
sleep in your own bed tonight.

346
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,109
I'm just saying New York cops
would've, you know,

347
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,835
shown me a little bit
of a better time by now.

348
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,934
If you're unhappy with
the quality of your ride along,

349
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:07,414
please feel free
to request another unit.

350
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:10,258
Look, I'm not happy.
You're not happy, either.

351
00:15:10,298 --> 00:15:11,568
You don't want to be taking

352
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:13,093
these low-risk calls
any more than I do.

353
00:15:13,134 --> 00:15:14,746
With all due respect,
I don't think you could handle

354
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,913
high-stakes calls.

355
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:17,066
Oh, yeah, is that a challenge?

356
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:18,702
No, just an observation.

357
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,932
- I've seen one of your movies.
- What, you didn't like it?

358
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,111
It was fine. It just had nothing
to do with real cop work.

359
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:24,255
<i>7-Adam-15,</i>

360
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,290
<i>we have a 415 at 9386 9th Avenue.</i>

361
00:15:27,342 --> 00:15:28,676
What's a 415?

362
00:15:28,777 --> 00:15:30,277
Family disturbance.

363
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,782
Probably just a loud argument.

364
00:15:32,921 --> 00:15:34,529
It's not that far from here.

365
00:15:37,294 --> 00:15:39,727
7-Adam-15 responding.

366
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:41,135
Yeah.

367
00:15:41,254 --> 00:15:42,934
- No! Relax.
- Everybody makes mistakes, bro.

368
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,567
- It's cool. Just chill.
- No! Go!

369
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:45,767
Ty.

370
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:48,736
Yo, you're scaring her, man, come on.

371
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:51,250
Everybody makes mistakes. Just chill.

372
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:53,167
Finally, some action.

373
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:54,651
- You, stay.
- No!

374
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:56,529
- Ty, Ty, it'll be okay.
- Shut up!

375
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,192
Everybody, put your hands
where I can see them.

376
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,542
Go. Go.

377
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:01,726
- Hey, back off. We don't need you here.
- Go!

378
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,251
Hey, Ma, I told you
not to call the cops.

379
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:05,635
- No! No! Go away!
- Yo, they gonna shoot him!

380
00:16:05,668 --> 00:16:06,765
- Nobody's shooting anybody.
- Go!

381
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:09,123
Everybody, put your hands
where I can see them now.

382
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:11,192
Go away!

383
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:12,574
Now.

384
00:16:14,229 --> 00:16:15,626
Knife!

385
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:18,139
Put the knife down!
Sir, drop the weapon now.

386
00:16:18,206 --> 00:16:20,376
- No! No! No! No! No! No!
- Wait, wait, wait!

387
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:22,143
Put the knife down!

388
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:26,059
- Put the weapon down now!
- I need you to put the knife down now.

389
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,016
- Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.
- Tyson, it's okay.

390
00:16:29,043 --> 00:16:30,844
Put down the knife, please.

391
00:16:30,878 --> 00:16:33,248
I did bad. Tyson did bad.

392
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:34,503
Sir, we are just here to help you,

393
00:16:34,524 --> 00:16:35,801
but we can't help
until you drop that knife.

394
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:36,913
Go. Go!

395
00:16:36,938 --> 00:16:40,007
He doesn't understand. Please.

396
00:16:40,189 --> 00:16:41,512
He's not gonna hurt anyone.

397
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:42,557
He's only a child.

398
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:44,284
- He doesn't know how big he is.
- Look, I won't let you hurt him.

399
00:16:44,308 --> 00:16:45,582
I need you to step back now.

400
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:47,050
Everyone, take it down a notch.

401
00:16:47,102 --> 00:16:49,225
Ty. Ty.

402
00:16:49,619 --> 00:16:51,729
He got confused. The alarm.

403
00:16:51,754 --> 00:16:53,465
I-I shouldn't have yelled at him.

404
00:16:53,489 --> 00:16:54,989
Could somebody take care of that alarm?

405
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,184
I'm sorry, Momma, I'm so sorry...

406
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,878
It's okay, baby. I know you
didn't mean to hurt me.

407
00:17:10,106 --> 00:17:11,676
I know!

408
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:14,789
I burnt the pancakes.

409
00:17:14,897 --> 00:17:16,762
I burnt the pancakes.

410
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:19,479
Looks like you didn't
flip them in time.

411
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:23,024
I forgot. I forgot. I forgot!

412
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,381
I do that sometimes, too. You know?

413
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:28,190
Forget when to flip them.

414
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:31,117
You want to know a little trick?

415
00:17:31,594 --> 00:17:33,104
How to know when to flip 'em?

416
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,051
You remember the little bubbles on top?

417
00:17:39,207 --> 00:17:40,697
Hmm?

418
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,129
When you see those little
bubbles on top,

419
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:46,516
you know it's time.

420
00:17:47,844 --> 00:17:49,152
Okay?

421
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:50,739
Okay.

422
00:17:50,813 --> 00:17:53,440
I need you to put
down the knife, Tyson.

423
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,139
Now. Okay?

424
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,035
Sorry...

425
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,415
- It's okay.
- It's all right.

426
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,934
Isn't public urination
usually a citation?

427
00:18:15,952 --> 00:18:17,986
You need to brush up on your
California Penal Code.

428
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:19,460
Section 314.

429
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:20,941
Indecent exposure is a misdemeanor

430
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,134
subject to six months in jail.

431
00:18:22,284 --> 00:18:23,518
Hmm.

432
00:18:25,048 --> 00:18:28,118
Indecent exposure
requires an offended party.

433
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,102
Plenty of offended families
living in the apartment building

434
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:31,259
across that alley.

435
00:18:31,427 --> 00:18:32,809
Mm.

436
00:18:33,348 --> 00:18:35,758
Respectfully, sir, that'll never stick.

437
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:39,768
It doesn't matter. Start processing.

438
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:41,541
Hey.

439
00:18:41,668 --> 00:18:42,847
Do you want me to give you a shout

440
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,049
if I see the detectives?

441
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:46,755
Yeah.

442
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,886
Open cell three for me.

443
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:11,199
I screwed up.

444
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:14,001
You think?

445
00:19:15,624 --> 00:19:17,069
How bad is it?

446
00:19:17,947 --> 00:19:19,382
It's a solid arrest.

447
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:23,254
Who's Carson Holland?

448
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,201
The car you were driving
is registered to him.

449
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:28,019
Is he your boyfriend?

450
00:19:29,245 --> 00:19:30,612
Sometimes.

451
00:19:33,995 --> 00:19:35,763
Okay, you have to tell them
the drugs belong to him.

452
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:37,255
We both know it won't matter.

453
00:19:37,473 --> 00:19:39,104
<i>I</i> was in possession.

454
00:19:40,028 --> 00:19:41,796
Isn't there something you can do?

455
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,334
- What?!
- They won't drop the charge.

456
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:45,227
It's connected to a DEA case.

457
00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:46,759
This is real, Isabel.

458
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:48,162
It's gonna get worse.

459
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,011
Because tomorrow, they're
gonna have a warrant

460
00:19:50,036 --> 00:19:51,086
to search my apartment.

461
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:52,410
What will they find?

462
00:19:57,647 --> 00:20:01,196
Carson stashed a kilo of heroin
in my heating unit.

463
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,270
Are you...

464
00:20:03,351 --> 00:20:05,352
Are you that far gone?

465
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:06,574
Why would you let him do that?

466
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:08,633
All right, I will not be able
to plea out of this.

467
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:10,818
So, i-if I go to jail,

468
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,527
they're gonna find out I was
a cop, and I'll be dead.

469
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:16,129
Please, baby. Go... Go to my place.

470
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:17,815
I need you.

471
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,769
If you help me, it'll be
different, all right?

472
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:22,270
I'll go to rehab.

473
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:24,396
- For real this time.
- You're just saying that.

474
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,789
No, no, this is different.
I ca... I can be different.

475
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,546
Please...

476
00:20:28,964 --> 00:20:31,657
help me. Okay?

477
00:20:32,014 --> 00:20:33,397
Please.

478
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:35,553
7-Adam-15

479
00:20:35,578 --> 00:20:38,847
requesting an additional unit
for a 51-50 hold.

480
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,215
Hey, y'all can let him go now.

481
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:41,610
Momma not pressing no more charges.

482
00:20:41,635 --> 00:20:43,418
- That's right.
- I'm sorry,

483
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:45,211
but we have no leeway here.
An assault was committed.

484
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:46,621
But we're not taking him to jail.

485
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:48,250
A doctor will evaluate his needs.

486
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:50,978
Depending on the diagnosis, he
may even qualify for a facility.

487
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:52,729
We can't afford that.

488
00:20:53,809 --> 00:20:55,526
Hey, what you doing, brah?

489
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:57,867
What the hell you doing?
Put that camera away, brah.

490
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:59,290
No, no, no, it's okay.
I'm... I'm a director.

491
00:20:59,314 --> 00:21:00,649
This is... This is so compelling.

492
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:02,777
- Compelling?
- Rupert, put the camera away.

493
00:21:02,802 --> 00:21:05,921
What, you think my brother's
pain is entertaining? Huh?

494
00:21:06,001 --> 00:21:07,205
- Step back. Step back.
- Put the camera away.

495
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:08,420
- Step back. Hey.
- You don't hear me, brah?

496
00:21:08,444 --> 00:21:09,518
I said put the camera away!
You think I'm playing with you?

497
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:11,818
Hey, guys, you do not
want to escalate this.

498
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:13,687
- No, no, no.
- Take it back.

499
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:16,536
- I'm scared.
- It's okay, honey.

500
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,059
It's okay, T. It's okay.

501
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:21,776
- It's okay, honey. Don't worry.
- I'm scared.

502
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:25,887
Hey, it's okay, T. I'm gonna
come visit you. I promise.

503
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:28,173
- We're gonna take care of this.
- Okay. Come on.

504
00:21:28,197 --> 00:21:29,274
Hey, I'm talking to my brother.
I'ma come visit you, I promise.

505
00:21:29,298 --> 00:21:30,871
- No.
- Just wait...

506
00:21:30,896 --> 00:21:32,776
- I'ma come see you, T.
- Wait in the car while we finish up.

507
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:34,921
- You're gonna be all right.
- No, I...

508
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:36,851
Hey, stay strong, okay?
I'ma come see you.

509
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:44,109
Explain something to me, Lopez.

510
00:21:44,206 --> 00:21:47,166
I can see you two filed
a lot of evidence reports,

511
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,490
but I can't seem to find
a single booking report.

512
00:21:50,813 --> 00:21:52,280
I've been instructing Officer West

513
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:54,339
about how patrol can leverage
lower-level criminals

514
00:21:54,423 --> 00:21:56,824
to get actual intel
on higher-level felons, sir.

515
00:21:56,886 --> 00:21:59,754
Perhaps earn some goodwill
prior to your Detectives exam?

516
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:03,280
Officer Lopez convinced
our last suspect

517
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:05,139
to give up a pretty significant target.

518
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:06,730
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

519
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:09,423
We have credible intel that
could get us Lawrence Abuto.

520
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:13,158
Major Assault Crimes would be thrilled

521
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:15,251
to collar a weapons dealer like Abuto.

522
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,773
Loop them in.

523
00:22:16,846 --> 00:22:18,379
- But, Lopez...
- Sir?

524
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,581
...be careful.

525
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,067
It's a high-reward strategy
but also high-risk.

526
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:24,346
There's a real possibility
this won't pay off at all,

527
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:25,663
and then all you did

528
00:22:25,688 --> 00:22:27,781
was let a bunch
of little crooks get away.

529
00:22:32,454 --> 00:22:33,721
I was very clear,

530
00:22:33,774 --> 00:22:36,749
yet you brought our VIP into an
incredibly volatile situation.

531
00:22:36,818 --> 00:22:38,152
It was unintentional.

532
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,822
We had no idea from the call
how dangerous it was gonna be.

533
00:22:40,956 --> 00:22:44,259
And that is the only reason that
I am being pleasant right now.

534
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:46,067
You're dismissed.

535
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:52,774
- Crazy day, huh?
- Um, did you guys get in trouble?

536
00:22:53,149 --> 00:22:55,011
- No.
- Good.

537
00:22:55,431 --> 00:22:59,529
Look, I-I'm having a little
thing at my place tonight,

538
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:02,125
and I would love it if you'd come.

539
00:23:02,664 --> 00:23:04,545
I'm gonna call it a day.

540
00:23:04,854 --> 00:23:06,261
Thanks.

541
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:10,205
She doesn't like me, does she?

542
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,624
Oh, she's...

543
00:23:12,861 --> 00:23:13,928
No.

544
00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:15,277
Yeah.

545
00:23:15,745 --> 00:23:17,250
I get that a lot.

546
00:23:17,747 --> 00:23:21,075
Listen, I'd really like it
if you came along tonight.

547
00:23:21,237 --> 00:23:25,094
It's my little way of saying
thank you for today.

548
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,726
I really should get home,
get some rest, but...

549
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,791
you know, someone did tell me I need to
start putting myself out there more,

550
00:23:32,815 --> 00:23:34,580
so what the hell?

551
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:38,194
Good. Good.

552
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:18,725
What are you doing here?

553
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:20,819
No, what are <i>you doing here?</i>

554
00:25:21,277 --> 00:25:22,944
Look, you're out of your depth on this.

555
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:26,313
Look, I've been riding
with you for two months.

556
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:28,485
You project the rogue cop thing,

557
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,178
but you are always on
the <i>right</i> side of the law.

558
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:33,493
If you came all the way
over here to psychoanalyze me,

559
00:25:33,518 --> 00:25:35,244
- you wasted your time.
- No, I...

560
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:39,317
I came here to remind you...

561
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:42,680
...that you'll regret helping her.

562
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:45,217
Because it's not gonna change her.

563
00:25:46,187 --> 00:25:47,854
But it'll sure as hell change you.

564
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:06,830
Yeah, I'm stepping into
an industry party right now.

565
00:26:06,885 --> 00:26:08,158
Hey, thanks, guy.

566
00:26:08,198 --> 00:26:09,599
Who said chivalry was dead?

567
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:20,610
- Ah, hey.
- Would you like an hors d'oeuvre?

568
00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:21,844
Uh...

569
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:23,836
I-I'll pass. Thanks.

570
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:25,328
- So good.
- Jason!

571
00:26:25,482 --> 00:26:27,156
- Oh, it's, uh...
- Never mind.

572
00:26:27,195 --> 00:26:29,205
I'm so, <i>so</i> glad you made it.

573
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:31,472
Oh, thanks. I-I feel underdressed.

574
00:26:31,522 --> 00:26:32,856
I didn't realize it was a...

575
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:34,343
It's Hollywood. No, no, no.

576
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:36,259
Look, there's food and booze out back.

577
00:26:36,347 --> 00:26:37,493
Go make yourself at home.

578
00:26:37,528 --> 00:26:38,895
I'll be out there in a second, okay?

579
00:26:38,935 --> 00:26:40,163
- Hi.
- Hi.

580
00:26:40,197 --> 00:26:41,364
Hi! Oh, look at you.

581
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,985
I don't know if I like it.

582
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:20,536
Mmm...

583
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:22,138
What do you think of my new digs?

584
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:24,001
Oh, this place is great.

585
00:27:24,074 --> 00:27:25,643
It used to belong to Marlon.

586
00:27:25,716 --> 00:27:27,643
- Brando?
- Wayans.

587
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,118
Oh.

588
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:30,920
You sure have a lot of friends.

589
00:27:30,945 --> 00:27:32,057
Oh, I don't know half these people.

590
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:33,903
They just wrangle invites
through their publicists.

591
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,374
Rupert.

592
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:36,948
Tiffany?

593
00:27:37,488 --> 00:27:39,589
We met at that Golden Globes thing.

594
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:42,285
Oh! Of course.

595
00:27:42,393 --> 00:27:44,560
Tiffany, this is, uh...
this is Jim Nolan.

596
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:45,824
John Nolan. Nice to meet you.

597
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:46,971
LAPD.

598
00:27:46,996 --> 00:27:48,414
He took me on a ride along today.

599
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:49,673
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

600
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:51,033
That's so cool.

601
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:52,435
So, what's it like being a cop?

602
00:27:52,469 --> 00:27:53,748
Oh, God, it's amazing.

603
00:27:53,877 --> 00:27:55,211
You should've seen my boy today.

604
00:27:55,432 --> 00:27:57,945
He stared death right in the face.

605
00:27:57,981 --> 00:27:59,081
Didn't even flinch.

606
00:27:59,106 --> 00:28:01,696
I-I flinched. It was super scary.

607
00:28:02,086 --> 00:28:04,397
I-I'm gonna grab a-a drink.
Very nice meeting you.

608
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,298
Can I grab a beer, please? Thank you.

609
00:28:13,672 --> 00:28:15,338
Hey, I saw that. Don't drink that.

610
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:16,776
- He put something in your drink.
- No, I didn't.

611
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,055
- Yes, you did.
- Get the hell off me.

612
00:28:18,128 --> 00:28:19,625
- I won't. I saw you.
- Get off...

613
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:23,899
You're under arrest.

614
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,967
Ladies and gentlemen, John Nolan, LAPD!

615
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,091
I'm sorry I ruined your party.

616
00:28:48,244 --> 00:28:49,563
Are you kidding? Everyone in town's

617
00:28:49,588 --> 00:28:51,155
gonna be talking about that tomorrow.

618
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:55,220
Oh, and besides, I got you
like a dozen phone numbers.

619
00:28:55,325 --> 00:28:57,921
Oh. Uh, thanks.

620
00:28:58,035 --> 00:28:59,936
That's, um...

621
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,511
Oh, hey, these are cute kids.

622
00:29:02,585 --> 00:29:03,743
Sorry I didn't get a chance
to meet 'em.

623
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,823
- Oh, yeah.
- They're in London right now.

624
00:29:05,848 --> 00:29:07,178
I haven't spoken to them in months.

625
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,478
That's sad.

626
00:29:08,552 --> 00:29:10,507
I try to talk to my son
at least once a week.

627
00:29:10,647 --> 00:29:13,482
Although, it's been a little
longer than that this time around.

628
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:18,501
Sacrifices we make
for our careers, huh?

629
00:29:18,642 --> 00:29:20,517
God, sometimes I wonder
if it's worth it.

630
00:29:20,618 --> 00:29:24,454
You know, these movies I make,
make a fortune,

631
00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:27,484
but I haven't made a film
anyone's cared about in <i>years.</i>

632
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,620
Oh, you're kidding, right?

633
00:29:28,645 --> 00:29:30,758
I mean, people love your movies.

634
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:32,588
The escape it brings them? Uh...

635
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:35,245
Life is hard. Your movies are fun.

636
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,704
But they're not real.

637
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,807
Not like <i>today</i> was real.

638
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:40,756
Look, let me tell you something.

639
00:29:41,024 --> 00:29:44,249
Some of my fondest memories
of my son growing up

640
00:29:44,274 --> 00:29:46,030
are tied to your movies.

641
00:29:46,136 --> 00:29:49,029
Uh, he was 10 when we saw the first,

642
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,197
and we were re-creating scenes
in the backyard.

643
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:54,247
I mean, it was a blast.

644
00:29:54,351 --> 00:29:57,320
Every summer after that, we'd go
to an opening weekend and...

645
00:29:57,474 --> 00:29:58,741
Actually, we just talked about

646
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,133
how we're gonna schedule the next one

647
00:30:00,158 --> 00:30:01,558
with him being away at college.

648
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:05,661
Thank you.

649
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:07,297
Yeah. Welcome.

650
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:09,561
And, um, uh, thanks for the invite.

651
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,031
J-John...

652
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,245
What's gonna happen
to the kid from today?

653
00:30:15,506 --> 00:30:17,640
After he gets out of hospital,

654
00:30:17,781 --> 00:30:19,081
will he get the care he needs?

655
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,901
Honestly, no.

656
00:30:22,095 --> 00:30:23,386
They just don't have the means.

657
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,215
Um, sadly, the system
is designed to deal with crisis,

658
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,040
not <i>prevent</i> it.

659
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:32,763
Um... thanks.

660
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:43,492
Sir, last night...

661
00:30:43,517 --> 00:30:45,084
Didn't happen.

662
00:30:45,148 --> 00:30:46,782
That clear?

663
00:30:47,036 --> 00:30:48,559
Hey,

664
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:50,502
I got some bad news.

665
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:52,216
Can't be worse than yesterday.

666
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:53,751
See, I'm afraid it can.

667
00:30:54,237 --> 00:30:55,929
Detectives executed a search warrant

668
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,055
on your wife's apartment this morning.

669
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:00,814
They found a kilo
hidden in the heating unit.

670
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:03,526
She's with her lawyer now.

671
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,047
I'm sorry, Tim.

672
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,503
You did the right thing.

673
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:19,122
Not for Isabel.

674
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:25,488
So, the kilo bumps you up
to a major trafficker,

675
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,110
which means you're facing 10 to 20 now.

676
00:31:29,726 --> 00:31:31,667
Now, you were a decorated officer

677
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:34,258
who got addicted on the job.

678
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:36,488
We could try to use that.

679
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:39,262
I went down the rabbit hole
after I got hooked.

680
00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:42,278
They could've investigated me
for half a dozen things.

681
00:31:42,372 --> 00:31:46,542
Instead, they brushed it under
the rug and fired me quietly.

682
00:31:46,914 --> 00:31:48,938
I'm nothing but dirty laundry to them.

683
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,906
Now they've got a clean shot,

684
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:52,972
they're gonna take it.

685
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:59,249
Major Crimes took a run at your
intel on Lawrence Abuto.

686
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:02,500
They couldn't do anything with
your informant's information.

687
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,847
Are they sure? 'Cause we had
that guy wrapped up with a bow.

688
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:06,905
He was lying to you, Officer Lopez.

689
00:32:07,144 --> 00:32:09,360
Frankly, I'm surprised
you couldn't tell.

690
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,193
Ma'am, I believed him, as well.

691
00:32:11,218 --> 00:32:13,048
Officer West, you're a rookie.

692
00:32:13,463 --> 00:32:14,850
Lopez, you're a veteran.

693
00:32:15,032 --> 00:32:16,899
You're usually a lot more
careful than this.

694
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,009
I'm really disappointed in you.

695
00:32:19,202 --> 00:32:20,809
Yes, ma'am.

696
00:32:23,228 --> 00:32:25,324
I heard you were the life
of the party last night.

697
00:32:25,365 --> 00:32:26,520
Did Rupert tell you that?

698
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,045
No, I heard it from the midnight shift.

699
00:32:29,126 --> 00:32:30,829
- So, was it any fun?
- No.

700
00:32:30,942 --> 00:32:32,882
Uh, i-it was interesting.

701
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:36,396
I find the whole Hollywood
thing depressing.

702
00:32:36,457 --> 00:32:39,371
All that energy spent on stuff
that just doesn't matter.

703
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,029
Oh, hey, here's your BFF now.

704
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,465
Oh. You can get that.

705
00:32:45,719 --> 00:32:47,901
- Hey. Rupert. Tell m...
<i>- Help!</i>

706
00:32:47,935 --> 00:32:49,903
<i>They're trying to kill me.</i>

707
00:32:49,937 --> 00:32:51,237
<i>- You've got to come.
- Rupert?</i>

708
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:52,607
<i>- My office.
- Rupert!</i>

709
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,057
His office is on the studio lot.

710
00:32:55,082 --> 00:32:56,218
Dispatch,

711
00:32:56,243 --> 00:32:58,510
we have a possible 207
at Beverly Oaks Studios.

712
00:32:58,993 --> 00:33:00,467
<i>John, are you still there?</i>

713
00:33:00,491 --> 00:33:01,891
- Rupert?
<i>- I think I lost them.</i>

714
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:03,560
Rupert, are you okay? We're on our way.

715
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,330
I've locked myself in the prop room.

716
00:33:05,405 --> 00:33:06,650
What's going on?

717
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:08,441
<i>I kept thinking about
what happened yesterday,</i>

718
00:33:08,748 --> 00:33:10,495
<i>so I reached out to Tyson's brother.</i>

719
00:33:10,608 --> 00:33:11,925
Look, a-at first, everything was fine,

720
00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:14,097
but then when I offered him
money to pay for a facility,

721
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:15,554
<i>he got really angry.</i>

722
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,682
He started to hit me,
and then his friends...

723
00:33:17,778 --> 00:33:19,966
- Down here!
- Oh, God...

724
00:33:20,227 --> 00:33:22,356
- His friends...
- Which way?! Come on!

725
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:24,409
...wanted me to open the safe
in my office,

726
00:33:24,456 --> 00:33:25,840
<i>but I managed to get away.</i>

727
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:27,073
Where'd he go?

728
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:28,373
<i>Oh, God.</i>

729
00:33:28,474 --> 00:33:29,674
<i>John, help. Help!</i>

730
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,708
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Please. Guys, please. Please.

731
00:33:32,732 --> 00:33:34,633
We gotta forget about him.
Yo, let's get out of here!

732
00:33:34,755 --> 00:33:35,981
No, not until we get all that money

733
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:37,065
from that safe in his office.

734
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,731
- I don't want his money.
- Yeah? Well, we do.

735
00:33:40,253 --> 00:33:41,929
Back to the offi...

736
00:33:42,046 --> 00:33:43,747
I've lost him.

737
00:33:54,448 --> 00:33:55,915
His office is in that building.

738
00:34:04,203 --> 00:34:05,904
- Stop! Police!
- Don't move!

739
00:34:12,745 --> 00:34:13,945
Aah!

740
00:34:16,636 --> 00:34:18,550
- Go get him.
- On it.

741
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:22,210
Cuff him and call it in!

742
00:34:22,624 --> 00:34:24,191
Hands behind your back.

743
00:34:27,147 --> 00:34:28,747
<i>So, you want to get your cameras ready</i>

744
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:30,729
<i>'cause up here to my left</i>

745
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,145
<i>is a sign you'll probably recognize...</i>

746
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:15,747
Malcolm, stop!

747
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,289
Your mother's suffered enough.

748
00:35:17,314 --> 00:35:18,815
You're only making it worse.

749
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:20,152
So what?

750
00:35:20,177 --> 00:35:21,955
You gonna be my savior now, too? Huh?

751
00:35:22,008 --> 00:35:23,222
Like Mr. Hollywood here?

752
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:25,282
Offering me money to make
himself feel like a hero...

753
00:35:25,351 --> 00:35:26,960
To put your brother in a facility.

754
00:35:26,985 --> 00:35:28,886
Yeah, and what happens
when that runs out, huh?

755
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:31,012
How we supposed to pay for your
fancy-ass facility and meds?

756
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,009
You gonna give us money for next
year and the year after that?

757
00:35:33,033 --> 00:35:35,267
- I told you, we'll work it out.
- Work it out?

758
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:36,979
Like it's that simple, huh?

759
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:39,188
Like my brother's just gonna be fixed
now that you're here to save the day.

760
00:35:39,212 --> 00:35:40,514
Malcolm, he doesn't understand.

761
00:35:40,553 --> 00:35:42,971
- Oh, and you do?
- No. God, no.

762
00:35:43,754 --> 00:35:45,200
I've never been in your shoes.

763
00:35:45,225 --> 00:35:47,294
I-I can't imagine

764
00:35:47,332 --> 00:35:49,200
what it's been like
for you and your mom

765
00:35:49,225 --> 00:35:50,459
to have to care for your brother,

766
00:35:50,484 --> 00:35:51,674
to make sure he doesn't hurt himself,

767
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:53,031
that he can never be alone.

768
00:35:53,106 --> 00:35:54,473
Then to have this

769
00:35:54,498 --> 00:35:56,678
poster child for entitlement
call you up like that?

770
00:35:56,703 --> 00:35:58,003
- Hey.
- Shh!

771
00:35:58,244 --> 00:36:00,012
It's gotta be infuriating.

772
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:04,009
But this...

773
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:08,361
...Malcolm, this... this helps no one.

774
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,767
This only hurts your brother,

775
00:36:10,792 --> 00:36:13,261
and I know you don't want to do that.

776
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:17,885
So, come on. Let's... put the gun down

777
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,655
and let's just end this, okay?

778
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,066
I got it! I got it!

779
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:26,331
- Drop the weapon!
- No!

780
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,656
- Oh!
- No! Come here.

781
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:31,516
Ohh...

782
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,618
- I got shot.
- Yeah.

783
00:36:38,706 --> 00:36:40,434
It really hurts.

784
00:36:40,555 --> 00:36:41,945
Don't worry, they're gonna take
good care of you.

785
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,291
ER's just five minutes away.

786
00:36:43,316 --> 00:36:44,517
Will you visit me in the hospital?

787
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:45,699
Of course, yes.

788
00:36:45,772 --> 00:36:47,907
Hey, please, tell Malcolm I'm sorry.

789
00:36:48,121 --> 00:36:49,891
I-I-I had no idea.

790
00:36:52,832 --> 00:36:54,826
- He's gonna be all right?
- Paramedics seem to think so.

791
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,802
Good, then I don't have to wait
to yell at you

792
00:36:56,827 --> 00:36:58,352
about getting your VIP shot.

793
00:36:58,478 --> 00:36:59,976
Well, technically, the
ride along was yesterday,

794
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,367
so...

795
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:02,714
Never mind.

796
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,671
We're transferring your wife to county.

797
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:07,310
Arraignment will be tomorrow.

798
00:37:07,561 --> 00:37:09,161
Can I get a minute with her?

799
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:15,944
I'm sorry.

800
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:18,835
I needed you, and you weren't there.

801
00:37:19,185 --> 00:37:20,519
It wouldn't have fixed things.

802
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,252
You don't know that!

803
00:37:22,842 --> 00:37:25,418
Now you never will. We're done here.

804
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:35,492
Hey. Been looking for you.

805
00:37:37,986 --> 00:37:39,420
What's wrong?

806
00:37:39,563 --> 00:37:41,903
The Jason is in ICU.

807
00:37:42,133 --> 00:37:44,772
What, you mean the guy
who likes to shock himself?

808
00:37:45,022 --> 00:37:47,605
The guy he flipped on
found out about it.

809
00:37:48,858 --> 00:37:50,902
Beat him half to death with a pipe.

810
00:37:54,383 --> 00:37:56,038
Th-That's not on us.

811
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:57,740
No, it's on <i>me.</i>

812
00:37:58,554 --> 00:38:01,155
If I hadn't been so gung ho
on getting The Tap,

813
00:38:01,341 --> 00:38:02,638
he'd be in the house of detention,

814
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:05,200
looking at a few months of jail.

815
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,382
Now he might not be able to walk again.

816
00:38:09,003 --> 00:38:10,698
There's no way you could've
known about that.

817
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:12,233
Maybe.

818
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:16,563
But I didn't even think about
it, and I should have.

819
00:38:18,907 --> 00:38:22,217
You, um, think this will
move you down the list?

820
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:25,996
Are you kidding? I'm off the list.

821
00:38:27,582 --> 00:38:30,205
Gonna have to earn my way back onto it.

822
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:37,064
Anything I can do to help... I will.

823
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:40,367
You had my back when I needed it.

824
00:38:45,134 --> 00:38:47,758
Oh, right. I almost forgot.

825
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,178
Did you hear about Tim's wife?

826
00:39:07,242 --> 00:39:08,823
What are you doing?

827
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:11,123
Hanging out with you.

828
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:16,331
Look, I appreciate the thought, but...

829
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:18,357
- I'd rather be alone.
- Too bad.

830
00:39:18,382 --> 00:39:19,570
I'm not gonna talk about it.

831
00:39:19,595 --> 00:39:21,035
You don't have to.

832
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,366
But we're gonna be here
if you change your mind.

833
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:31,570
So what do we do now?

834
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:33,076
Drink.

835
00:39:41,392 --> 00:39:42,659
- Hey.
- Hey.

836
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:44,518
- One of those for me?
- Well, it is now.

837
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,247
Hey, I saw the news about Rupert.

838
00:39:47,738 --> 00:39:49,184
- You okay?
- Yeah.

839
00:39:49,209 --> 00:39:52,211
Days like today
can be hard emotionally.

840
00:39:52,522 --> 00:39:53,919
I'll bet.

841
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:57,066
Well, I have a plus-one
to a gallery opening.

842
00:39:57,141 --> 00:40:00,176
You can come if you want
and take your mind off it.

843
00:40:00,271 --> 00:40:02,205
Yeah, you know what? I'm... I'm beat.

844
00:40:02,265 --> 00:40:03,348
You sure? I mean...

845
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:05,608
I-I-I can stay home
if you don't want to be alone.

846
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:07,137
I won't be.

847
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:10,100
Okay.

848
00:40:12,216 --> 00:40:13,316
You have a good night.

849
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:14,464
I will.

850
00:40:36,626 --> 00:40:38,268
- Hey, buddy.
<i>- Dad!</i>

851
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:39,678
Oh, it's good to see your face.

852
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,940
I'm sorry I haven't called
in a few days.

853
00:40:41,965 --> 00:40:44,400
I've just been crazy with work.

854
00:40:44,515 --> 00:40:46,625
<i>No worries. I'm slammed myself.</i>

855
00:40:46,717 --> 00:40:48,902
- Everything okay?
<i>- Yeah, great.</i>

856
00:40:48,973 --> 00:40:51,634
<i>Uh, we're reading "Catch-22,"
which I love.</i>

857
00:40:51,736 --> 00:40:54,204
<i>And, uh, my roommate moved in
with his girlfriend,</i>

858
00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:56,439
<i>so got the dorm all to myself.</i>

859
00:40:56,573 --> 00:40:57,864
Sweet.

860
00:40:58,088 --> 00:41:00,288
Um, tell me what you think of this.

861
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:01,625
Uh...

862
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,455
What if I was to book you a flight

863
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,014
and you come to L.A.,
just visit a few days?

864
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:06,912
<i>I've got midterms next week,</i>

865
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:08,905
<i>but after that, I am... I am all in.</i>

866
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,927
Awesome. Okay, uh, text me the dates,

867
00:41:10,952 --> 00:41:13,520
and I'll book the flights. Meantime...

868
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:16,214
you will never guess who I met.

869
00:41:16,707 --> 00:41:18,307
Rupert Payne.

870
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,631
<i>Wait.</i>

871
00:41:19,695 --> 00:41:21,397
<i>D-Did I see that he just got shot?</i>

872
00:41:21,422 --> 00:41:23,007
- Yeah.
<i>- Was that with you?</i>

873
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:24,152
<i>Yeah, crazy story.</i>

874
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:25,729
<i>- Oh, tell me. Tell me.
