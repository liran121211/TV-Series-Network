1
00:00:00,717 --> 00:00:03,429
Everything was actually going
fine until we hit the nuns.

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:05,685
- You assaulted a nun?
- No, no.

3
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:07,960
The suspect I was chasing...

4
00:00:08,202 --> 00:00:10,515
made a beeline for
a group of nuns.

5
00:00:10,616 --> 00:00:13,427
A gathering...
is it a flock of nuns?

6
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:15,028
I know it's not a murder
of nuns.

7
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,583
- Ow!
- Sorry.

8
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:18,256
Tell me the truth.
Do I look like a porcupine?

9
00:00:18,343 --> 00:00:19,817
You don't not look
like a porcupine.

10
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:21,676
Officer Nolan, focus.

11
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:24,278
We split up.
I came back with a suspect,

12
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:26,679
and you came back with
a new hairdo and empty cuffs.

13
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:31,138
Yes. As I was saying...
Ow... the nuns slowed me down,

14
00:00:31,226 --> 00:00:33,833
allowing the suspect to get away,
jumping over a fence.

15
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:36,013
How many times have I told you
not to hop a fence

16
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:37,379
without knowing
what's on the other side?

17
00:00:37,466 --> 00:00:38,576
Enough that I shouldn't
have done it?

18
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,226
- Mm-hmm.
- But he was getting away,

19
00:00:40,314 --> 00:00:41,687
so I just... I just...
I went over.

20
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,614
And landed headfirst
on a cactus.

21
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:45,413
No, no.

22
00:00:46,015 --> 00:00:48,593
First, I had to get away
from the dog.

23
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,929
The cactus was over
the second fence.

24
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:52,895
This is really
the lowest point

25
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:54,804
in my rookie experience,
isn't it?

26
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,073
Hey. I'm looking for
Officer John Nolan?

27
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:58,161
That's me.

28
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,233
You've been served.

29
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:01,074
Thanks.
Wait. What?

30
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,477
<i>♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh-oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

31
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:06,038
No. I'd say
this is the lowest point.

32
00:01:06,126 --> 00:01:10,421
<i>♪ I'm gonna win for you,
like I know you want me to do ♪</i>

33

34
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:14,452
Hey. Heard you're
officially a cop now.

35
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,905
Got hit with
your first lawsuit.

36
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:17,054
Oh, it's ridiculous.

37
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:19,099
This guy says I dislocated
his shoulder

38
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:20,825
pushing past him
in a pursuit.

39
00:01:20,913 --> 00:01:22,661
I-I don't think
I even touched him.

40
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,378
And now he wants fifty thousand
to settle.

41
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:26,334
Don't take it personally.
Being sued's part of the job.

42
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:28,474
It's why we're required to have
liability insurance.

43
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:29,833
Union assign
a lawyer yet?

44
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,919
Yeah.
Some guy named Simon Parks.

45
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:33,359
You're lucky.
Guy's a legend.

46
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:34,755
Saved my ass
a couple times.

47
00:01:34,843 --> 00:01:37,065
He's a cranky old S.O.B.,
but he gets the job done.

48
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:38,687
You've got nothing
to worry about.

49
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:42,162
What's going on?

50
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,827
IA arrested Jenkins.

51
00:01:44,574 --> 00:01:46,208
The Robbery Homicide
detective?

52
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:48,163
- Yeah.
- Why?

53
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,726
All right. Grab a seat.

54
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:55,641
See, look, it's never
a good day

55
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:57,375
when one of your own
gets arrested.

56
00:01:57,581 --> 00:01:59,039
I'm sure you have questions.

57
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:01,750
Commander West from IA
is here to answer.

58
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:02,881
Commander?

59
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,102
Thank you, Sergeant.

60
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,621
After an extensive
investigation,

61
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,367
we found clear evidence
that, ten years ago,

62
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,258
Detective Jenkins
lied on the witness stand.

63
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:14,164
Because of his lies,
an innocent woman

64
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:16,029
was convicted of
murder in the first.

65
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:17,531
She's been in jail
this whole time?

66
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:20,822
Yes. Samantha Bennett.
She was released two days ago.

67
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:23,906
In addition to charging Jenkins
with perjury,

68
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,836
we've placed him
on the Brady List.

69
00:02:25,924 --> 00:02:27,625
Uh, what is the Brady List?

70
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:30,209
Uh, it's a record of
law enforcement officers

71
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:31,953
who've withheld exculpatory
evidence...

72
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,453
It's a list of dirty cops.

73
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:37,078
IA has reviewed all
of Jenkins' past convictions.

74
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:40,235
Of them, three others
were deemed suspect enough

75
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:42,102
to warrant the release
of those felons.

76
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,484
But you're not sure
those three are innocent.

77
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:45,638
No, but their convictions
were overturned.

78
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,212
When this gets out,
every lawyer in town

79
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,329
is gonna want to get a Jenkins
conviction overturned.

80
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,563
That's tomorrow's problem.

81
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:53,141
Today, protocol dictates

82
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:56,514
that we make voluntary contact
with these released felons.

83
00:02:56,602 --> 00:02:59,975
So, Lopez and West, you will
talk to Samantha Bennett.

84
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:02,686
Bradford, Chen,
you got Max Kegel,

85
00:03:02,774 --> 00:03:05,508
who was doing 25 to life
for drug trafficking.

86
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:08,938
And, Bishop and Nolan,
take Terry Wright,

87
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,289
who was in for armed robbery
and attempted murder.

88
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:14,235
If you observe anything
actionable,

89
00:03:14,323 --> 00:03:15,852
send it up to Major Crimes.

90
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,711
And what if we don't see
anything actionable?

91
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:18,891
Leave it alone.

92
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:21,392
Observe, report.
That's it.

93
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,102
All right.
Be safe out there.

94
00:03:26,087 --> 00:03:28,865
Oh. My lawyer's here.

95
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:31,404
Hmm. You're lucky to be
getting Simon Parks.

96
00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:32,949
He's been doing this
for 40 years.

97
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:34,410
Can't beat that kind
of experience.

98
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:36,251
- Officer Nolan?
- Yes?

99
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,125
I thought we should meet before
this afternoon's arbitration.

100
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:41,454
Go over the game plan, answer
any questions you might have.

101
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,374
Great.
Uh, who are you?

102
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,396
Y-Your lawyer.
Simon Parks Junior.

103
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:48,381
Oh, I-I thought...

104
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:50,779
You thought I was my father.

105
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:53,242
Believe me, I know I have
some big shoes to fill,

106
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:56,045
but I'm excited to get started
on my first case with you.

107
00:03:57,765 --> 00:04:01,298
The oldest Boot paired
with the youngest lawyer.

108
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:03,276
Sounds like a match
made in heaven.

109
00:04:03,364 --> 00:04:06,529
Right? Now, as far as your role
in today's mediation goes,

110
00:04:06,617 --> 00:04:07,615
less is more.

111
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:09,193
They will try to get under
your skin,

112
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:10,404
so let me do the talking.

113
00:04:10,492 --> 00:04:12,612
And 2:00 is 2:00,
so don't be late.

114
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,614
Right.

115
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:14,873
Um, let me know if you have

116
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,709
any questions, okay?

117
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,740
Did he say "first case"?

118
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:23,225
Mm-hmm.

119
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,957
So, you and your mother
finally make up,

120
00:04:26,045 --> 00:04:27,577
and now you're giving me
the cold shoulder?

121
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:30,697
No. I, um... things have
just been really crazy.

122
00:04:30,785 --> 00:04:33,828
Oh, too crazy to respond to
texts? Return phone calls?

123
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,060
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I've just been focused

124
00:04:36,148 --> 00:04:37,881
on the job and the exam.

125
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:40,568
What I know is that you're
not ready to have a man-to-man

126
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:41,872
about what's going on
with you,

127
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,131
but I expect you to be
by end of day.

128
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:46,232
So come find me
when you're ready.

129
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,183
What was that about?

130
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:52,580
Nothing.

131
00:04:54,437 --> 00:04:58,467
Hey, um, do you remember,
uh, that felon Oscar

132
00:04:58,585 --> 00:04:59,948
from the prison bus crash?

133
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:02,449
Stole a car, tried to
run us over? That Oscar?

134
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:04,586
Yeah. Um, when I was
booking him,

135
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:06,467
he told me some stories
about my dad.

136
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:07,951
What kind of stories?

137
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,820
That he was my dad's CI
back in the day.

138
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:12,874
Said that my dad used to
give him intel

139
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:14,499
in exchange for turning
a blind eye.

140
00:05:14,587 --> 00:05:15,648
Lots of cops do that.

141
00:05:15,736 --> 00:05:16,966
Yeah, he also said
that my dad

142
00:05:17,054 --> 00:05:18,203
planted a gun on him.

143
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,460
Got him sent away
for life.

144
00:05:19,548 --> 00:05:21,671
Let me guess.
Oscar insisted he was innocent.

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,273
No. He said he was guilty,
but no one could prove it.

146
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:27,085
So my dad crossed the line.

147
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:28,287
I don't believe it.
Your dad is

148
00:05:28,374 --> 00:05:29,882
the straightest
arrow I've ever met...

149
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,445
Besides you.

150
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:38,960
No, no. I understand.
Okay. Thank you. Bye.

151
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,655
Well, the union says
I can't switch lawyers.

152
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:43,945
They said, and I quote,
"You get what you get,"

153
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,841
which is exactly
what I said to my son

154
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,304
when he wouldn't eat
his peas.

155
00:05:47,392 --> 00:05:49,491
He's a lawyer, Officer Nolan,
not a fish.

156
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:50,696
You can't just throw him
back because

157
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,187
you think
he's too small.

158
00:05:53,557 --> 00:05:55,562
Thought I might be seeing police
at some point.

159
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,052
Oh, we're just
checking in on you

160
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,466
after your unexpected
recent release.

161
00:05:59,554 --> 00:06:01,755
What, five years into
a 20-year sentence

162
00:06:01,843 --> 00:06:03,904
for attempted murder
and armed robbery?

163
00:06:04,027 --> 00:06:05,076
It's a miracle.

164
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:06,857
The man upstairs
looking out for me.

165
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:08,163
- Huh.
- Mind telling us what you've

166
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,880
been doing since you
got back into town?

167
00:06:10,052 --> 00:06:11,310
Of course.

168
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,365
Moved back in
with my old lady here,

169
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,591
been eating way too much
fast food.

170
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,623
Soon as I get the old van
up and running,

171
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,204
I'm gonna start
looking for work.

172
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,909
Right.

173
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,807
You look familiar.
Are you...

174
00:06:24,103 --> 00:06:25,440
Don't I know you
from somewhere?

175
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:28,181
With your rap sheet,
I'm sure we've crossed paths.

176
00:06:28,317 --> 00:06:30,127
I used to run with this kid
named Dylan.

177
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,413
I think you know him.

178
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,620
Doesn't ring a bell.

179
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,760
You must have me mixed up
with somebody else.

180
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:37,158
Okay.

181
00:06:37,246 --> 00:06:38,666
Do yourself a favor,
Mr. Wright.

182
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:40,315
You've been given
a rare second chance.

183
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:42,940
Take advantage of it.
Stay out of trouble.

184
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,245
Yes, ma'am.

185
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:49,073
So what do you think?

186
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,182
That he's gonna be
trouble.

187
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,237
Why all the extra shifts?

188
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:55,823
Why not? I've got hours to
fill when I'm not studying.

189
00:06:55,943 --> 00:06:58,284
Yeah, but don't you need
time off to recharge?

190
00:06:58,372 --> 00:06:59,665
What do you do to unwind?

191
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,323
Work out. And don't
tell me, "If it has 'work'

192
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:03,615
in the title,
it can't be relaxing."

193
00:07:03,702 --> 00:07:05,284
It's true.
You need a hobby,

194
00:07:05,372 --> 00:07:06,461
something you do for fun.

195
00:07:06,549 --> 00:07:07,807
No, I don't.

196
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,943
Mr. Kegel, I hear you've
had a bit of bad luck

197
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:12,113
since you got out of prison.

198
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,377
Tell me about it.

199
00:07:13,472 --> 00:07:16,455
Eight years of prison food
without as much as the runs,

200
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:19,292
and one bad bowl of clams
lands me in the hospital.

201
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:21,237
Mr. Kegel, I'm sure that
your recent release

202
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:23,206
has brought up
some strong emotions.

203
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:25,049
Only good ones.

204
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:28,174
Hell, I thought I'd never get
to consummate this marriage.

205
00:07:29,027 --> 00:07:31,190
Alicia and I were,
uh, pen pals.

206
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:34,811
She wrote to me in prison for
a year before we got hitched.

207
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:37,784
Huh. I've always wondered about
women marrying guys in prison.

208
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:38,963
What's the appeal?

209
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:42,533
Oh, well, I read about his case,
and I saw his photo,

210
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:45,557
and... I just fell in love.

211
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:48,620
Look. Now that I'm out,
I plan on keeping my nose clean

212
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:51,284
and my wife
between the sheets.

213
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:52,424
Oh.

214
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:54,284
Officers, uh, may I speak
with you, please?

215
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,612
Sure thing.

216
00:07:59,383 --> 00:08:01,041
I just got Mr. Kegel's
test results,

217
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:02,987
and, unfortunately,
it's not food poisoning.

218
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:03,953
What is it?

219
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,049
Poison poisoning.

220
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:06,979
Hydramethylnon,
to be specific.

221
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,151
It's a chemical used
in roach traps.

222
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,956
Mrs. Kegel, can you
come out here, please?

223
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:13,502
No.

224
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,018
What's going on?

225
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,352
Who made the clams?

226
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,081
My honey bunny. Why?

227
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,299
'Cause they were poisoned.

228
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,526
Guess your wife wasn't
psyched you came home.

229
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,838
What? Is that true?

230
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:32,041
You were never supposed
to get out of jail.

231
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:33,776
That was the whole allure.

232
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:36,557
Besides, it got my mother off
my back about me being single.

233
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:39,807
And then you came home,
and you were all...

234
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:44,348
clammy and handsy,
and I just snapped.

235
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,198
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
to stand up.

236
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,737
Turn around.
Hands behind your back.

237
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,862
Sorry.

238
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:56,932
Samantha Bennett
really took it in the teeth.

239
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,315
Ten years for a crime
she didn't commit.

240
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:01,372
Barely a traffic ticket
before she went inside.

241
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,291
And her file says
she has a kid.

242
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:05,488
Child was only a year old
when her mom went to prison.

243
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:07,144
Yeah. There's no way
she comes out the same person.

244
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:08,724
Prison hardens you.

245
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:10,766
Where the hell are they?!
Somebody help!

246
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:12,243
- Where's my family?
- Don't hurt me.

247
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,204
Where are they?

248
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,284
Drop the bat!

249
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:15,662
No. It's not fair!

250
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,487
Arrest her. She's crazy!

251
00:09:17,575 --> 00:09:20,596
Look, Samantha, please.
Put down the bat.

252
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:22,565
This isn't gonna help you.

253
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:25,182
Is that what you want?
You want to help me?

254
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:28,107
Like you helped me
the ten years in jail?

255
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:30,323
Like you helped to
convince my husband

256
00:09:30,411 --> 00:09:31,909
that I was a murderer?

257
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:34,838
You know what it feels like
to have the person that you love

258
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:36,088
turn against you,

259
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,719
believe you're capable
of the worst thing imaginable?

260
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:42,456
Ten years, he never once
brought my baby to visit me,

261
00:09:42,544 --> 00:09:44,049
said she was better off
without me.

262
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:45,550
I know you're upset.

263
00:09:45,638 --> 00:09:47,961
I can only imagine
what you've been through.

264
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:49,730
But this man doesn't know
where your family is.

265
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:50,863
Do you?

266
00:09:50,951 --> 00:09:53,893
Of course not!
They moved out years ago.

267
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:56,737
I just... I just
want to see my baby.

268
00:09:56,825 --> 00:09:58,108
I didn't know where else
to go.

269
00:09:58,196 --> 00:10:01,825
Samantha, you need
to put the bat down.

270
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,120
Please don't send me back there.
Please don't send me back there.

271
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,001
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Please.

272
00:10:20,417 --> 00:10:22,643
First arbitration.
You nervous?

273
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:24,266
A little bit.
What are you gonna do?

274
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:25,737
Be a cop.

275
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,596
Um...
can I ask you something?

276
00:10:29,684 --> 00:10:30,759
Okay.

277
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:31,856
Who's Dylan?

278
00:10:31,944 --> 00:10:32,948
What?

279
00:10:33,036 --> 00:10:34,750
The guy that Terry
thought you both knew.

280
00:10:34,838 --> 00:10:36,227
I got a vibe that you
weren't being

281
00:10:36,315 --> 00:10:38,315
- completely straight with him.
- You got the vibe?

282
00:10:38,462 --> 00:10:40,182
What kind of vibe are
you getting right now?

283
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:43,362
That I've overstepped.

284
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:46,384
I don't know any Dylan.
End of story.

285
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:49,002
Good talk.

286
00:10:55,377 --> 00:10:56,760
Turn to...

287
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:58,500
Okay.

288
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:01,026
Come on.

289
00:11:01,237 --> 00:11:02,719
I'm never gonna find them.

290
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:05,086
Look, I'm... I'm sure
someone knows where they are.

291
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:06,578
She probably hates me anyway.

292
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,854
Your daughter?

293
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,159
I missed her whole life.

294
00:11:10,807 --> 00:11:13,104
The best I can hope is that
Tom told her I was dead.

295
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:16,044
Otherwise, I'm just
mom the murderer.

296
00:11:16,132 --> 00:11:18,125
Yeah, but you're
innocent, okay?

297
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,755
And that will be all over
the news

298
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:21,205
now that Jenkins
was arrested.

299
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:23,573
So is the fact that
I'm back in jail.

300
00:11:24,114 --> 00:11:26,659
No, Tom is right.

301
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:29,721
She's better off
without me.

302
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:32,331
I'm no good to anybody now.

303
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:35,125
Don't say that.

304
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,585
This isn't right.

305
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:47,546
No, but our hands
are tied.

306
00:11:47,842 --> 00:11:50,255
We have to be able to do
something to help her.

307
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:52,215
This isn't just about her,
is it?

308
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:53,475
Yeah.

309
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,366
All right,
and maybe my dad, too.

310
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,491
A dirty cop
ruined her life.

311
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:04,255
Look,
let me think on Samantha,

312
00:12:04,342 --> 00:12:06,069
see if I can figure
something out.

313
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:08,515
But you need to get your head
straight about your dad.

314
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,135
Either go talk to him
or let it go.

315
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:12,694
What you can't do is let
the doubt eat away at you.

316
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:17,960
- Hey.
- Hey.

317
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:19,936
How's it going
with Jenkins?

318
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:21,600
Usual song and dance.

319
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:23,761
He's crying conspiracy,
coercion,

320
00:12:23,849 --> 00:12:25,352
trying to muddy the waters.

321
00:12:25,632 --> 00:12:28,116
I've been meaning to ask you,
how's my boy doing?

322
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:30,375
Well, you know.
Standing tall some days,

323
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:33,153
falling on his face others,
like all rookies before him.

324
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:34,543
Like us back in the day.

325
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,835
Yeah, but he's been acting
a little strange

326
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,663
the last few weeks.
Standoffish.

327
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:40,067
Something I should know?

328
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:41,497
You'd have to ask him.

329
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:42,879
Tell me about his T.O.

330
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:44,755
- Officer Lopez?
- Yeah.

331
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,944
She's a good cop.

332
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,454
On paper, sure, but I'm asking
about her instincts,

333
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:50,926
her leadership skills,
her ability to teach my son

334
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:52,749
things he can't learn
from his rook book.

335
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:55,131
Percy, I'm not quite sure
how to reply to that.

336
00:12:55,219 --> 00:12:58,944
See, this is specifically why
I asked you to assign.

337
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:01,875
Officer Bradford
to my son, not Lopez.

338
00:13:01,962 --> 00:13:03,995
He's a known entity,
a cop's cop.

339
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:05,495
With her, I'm wondering,

340
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,741
does she truly have
what Jackson needs?

341
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,842
Are you asking as head
of Internal Affairs

342
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,437
or a nervous father
overstepping his bounds?

343
00:13:12,847 --> 00:13:15,520
Listen.
I know you outrank me,

344
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:17,225
but I'm gonna tell you
exactly what I said

345
00:13:17,312 --> 00:13:19,867
when Jackson was assigned
here... no special favors.

346
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:21,966
Wa... Wade. I'm not asking
for special favors...

347
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:24,695
That includes keeping
tabs on him.

348
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:27,500
Is that understood,
Commander?

349
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,914
It is, Sergeant.

350
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:34,390
Excuse me.

351
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,834
I was just about
to call you.

352
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:45,484
Let me guess.
You can't make dinner?

353
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:48,555
Sorry. One of my clients was put
away by that Brady Cop... Jenkins.

354
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:49,921
I've got to go back through
the case,

355
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:51,187
see if anything
shakes loose.

356
00:13:51,275 --> 00:13:53,648
Today must be like Christmas
morning for defense attorneys.

357
00:13:53,821 --> 00:13:55,614
Yeah, except instead
of presents,

358
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:57,398
we have boxes of discovery
to open.

359
00:13:57,582 --> 00:13:58,705
Um...

360
00:13:58,792 --> 00:13:59,495
Oh.
Listen. Hey.

361
00:13:59,582 --> 00:14:00,296
Yeah. Hi.

362
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:01,665
I, uh...
Mm-hmm?

363
00:14:01,752 --> 00:14:03,376
I have to go see a client on
Saturday, but I'll be back Sunday.

364
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:05,384
I'm on duty Sunday.

365
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,216
Right. Well,
uh, nice to see you.

366
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:11,672
Yeah.

367
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,000
- How are you doing? Good? Yep.
- Mm.

368
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:24,131
So, I heard you tried
to get me replaced.

369
00:14:24,219 --> 00:14:27,299
Okay. Yes, I did. But you said
this was your very first case.

370
00:14:27,387 --> 00:14:29,417
You have to understand that
would make me a little nervous.

371
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:31,175
They handed you a gun on your
first day, didn't they?

372
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,335
Yes. And that made me
a little nervous, too.

373
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:36,440
Look, I grew up
in a courtroom.

374
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:38,236
I learned every trick
my dad knows.

375
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:40,480
Passed the Bar first time out
with a near-perfect score.

376
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,610
So trust me when I say,
I got this.

377
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:44,119
I need you focused on you,

378
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:46,250
staying calm,
attentive, quiet.

379
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:47,554
Can you do that?

380
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:48,752
Absolutely.

381
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,913
- Great.
- Yeah.

382
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,743
But just so you know,
I got a couple of years

383
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,867
of Pre-Law under my belt.

384
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:54,712
I've gone to small claims court
a number of times

385
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,545
to get paid for jobs,
so if you need anything...

386
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:59,455
I appreciate that,
but lawyering is my job.

387
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:01,205
Oh, absolutely.
100 percent.

388
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:03,330
But I've got your back
if you need it.

389
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:04,541
- I won't.
- Right.

390
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:06,044
But if you do...

391
00:15:06,132 --> 00:15:07,252
I won't.

392
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:13,650
You're late.

393
00:15:13,738 --> 00:15:15,111
Apologies, Your Honor.

394
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,690
Sorry. My fault.
I was on patrol.

395
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:20,255
And I was getting my prostate
squared away.

396
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,760
Still got here on time.

397
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:24,055
Yes, sir.
Sorry again.

398
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:27,008
Really? A neck brace?
This happened a month ago.

399
00:15:27,096 --> 00:15:29,170
Officer Nolan, please don't
interact with the plaintiff.

400
00:15:29,257 --> 00:15:31,351
It's called emotional whiplash.

401
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:34,351
My doctor says it's from
having to relive the incident

402
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,692
over and over again
the past few days.

403
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,039
That's not a real thing.

404
00:15:38,127 --> 00:15:40,455
We need to get a medical expert
in here to swear under oath...

405
00:15:40,542 --> 00:15:42,234
What did I say about
letting me do my job?

406
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:44,664
Hey, counsel... can we get
this circus started?

407
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:47,415
Yes, sir. Sorry.
Simon Parks for the defendant.

408
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:49,335
Jephson Green for the plaintiff,
Your Honor.

409
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:52,297
It seems you did a little
reckless running on the job,

410
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:53,404
Officer Nolan.

411
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,531
Your Honor, I was in pursuit
of a wanted felon...

412
00:15:55,619 --> 00:15:57,195
Did that sound like
a question?

413
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:01,305
You think this is gonna
be easy, don't ya?

414
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:03,101
Just waltz in here,

415
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:05,117
charm the pants off of me
with your uniform

416
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:06,945
and your dimples.

417
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,484
- No, sir.
- I have the power...

418
00:16:10,248 --> 00:16:12,071
to give this man your pension.

419
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,930
Uh, Your Honor, if I may,

420
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:16,164
we have Officer Nolan's
body cam footage,

421
00:16:16,252 --> 00:16:17,335
if you'll allow us
to play it.

422
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:19,438
Sure. Sounds fun.

423
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:20,655
Great.

424
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,923
Oof.

425
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:27,062
There.

426
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,275
Can we just say case closed?
Seriously...

427
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,277
Should we switch seats?

428
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,838
Do you want to do my job? Would
you let me handle this, please?

429
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:35,066
All right.

430
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:37,205
This is the fourth time
that Mr. Lynch

431
00:16:37,293 --> 00:16:38,705
has brought suit against
a police officer.

432
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,955
Prior history, Your Honor,
is just that... history.

433
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,545
It has no bearing on the fact
that Officer Nolan

434
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:48,332
assaulted my client, causing him
lasting physical injury.

435
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:51,875
And only Your Honor has
the power to make this right.

436
00:16:51,962 --> 00:16:53,660
Well said.

437
00:17:10,678 --> 00:17:12,099
Forget it.

438
00:17:12,187 --> 00:17:14,850
Dylan, wait.
We need to talk.

439
00:17:14,938 --> 00:17:17,231
Oh, do we, now?
After all these years,

440
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,637
that's how you want
to play this.

441
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,436
Please?

442
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,721
Look, one of your former
running buddies

443
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,093
just got out of Folsom.
Terry Wright.

444
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,022
Have you heard from him?

445
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:41,475
Seriously, Talia?

446
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:43,584
You came all the way down here
to ask me about some guy

447
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:45,415
from the neighborhood
I knew 15 years ago.

448
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:48,342
Cut the crap. You and Terry
got a lot tighter after I left.

449
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,895
You think I didn't
know that?

450
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:51,374
Oh, I see.

451
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:53,045
So you too good
to stay in touch,

452
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:55,913
but you can keep tabs on me,
stay all up in my business.

453
00:17:56,003 --> 00:17:57,966
I am trying to
look out for you.

454
00:17:58,272 --> 00:18:00,754
You're suspected of pulling
at least five jobs with Terry.

455
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,577
You're lucky you only
got caught once.

456
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,658
You got a lot of nerve
calling me "lucky."

457
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:06,918
Hey, I never asked to be
taken to another family.

458
00:18:07,006 --> 00:18:08,039
Yeah, but you sure as hell

459
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:09,248
couldn't wait
to get up out of there.

460
00:18:09,335 --> 00:18:10,483
And can you blame me?

461
00:18:10,571 --> 00:18:12,631
That home was a nightmare.

462
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:16,491
I would've taken you with me
if I could have.

463
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:18,030
Yeah, well, it's cool.

464
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:20,467
Yeah, I took care of myself.

465
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,311
Got clean, got straight.

466
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,983
Been working a warehouse job
for about a year now.

467
00:18:26,201 --> 00:18:27,794
So I got no need for you,

468
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:29,350
and I ain't got no need
for Terry.

469
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:31,780
I got to go to work.

470
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:34,674
Dylan, I...

471
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:38,350
I ju...
I... I'm sorry.

472
00:18:39,741 --> 00:18:42,092
I'm sorry I haven't
been around.

473
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:47,671
I had to step away
when I joined the police.

474
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,413
Yeah, you were embarrassed.
I get it.

475
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:50,944
No!

476
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,405
Because a family connection
to a criminal

477
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:55,272
would have kept me
off the force.

478
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:57,741
And if they find out now
that I lied

479
00:18:57,829 --> 00:18:59,600
and I left you
off of my personal history,

480
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:01,225
I could lose my job.

481
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:04,967
Well, no worries.
I don't know you anyway.

482
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,458
Your Honor, I'd like to submit
some crucial evidence

483
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:16,629
we've recently received.

484
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:18,028
Another video
of the assault.

485
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:18,852
Your Honor, any evidence

486
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:20,642
should have been provided
during discovery.

487
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:22,482
Whoa!
Things just got real.

488
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:24,788
This video just came
to my attention,

489
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:26,383
and after viewing it,
you'll understand why

490
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,442
we've upped our financial demand
to $50,000.

491
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:31,093
You can go ahead and up it
to $100 million. I don't care.

492
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:32,657
I'm not paying it because
I didn't do anything wrong.

493
00:19:32,744 --> 00:19:35,022
No, no. Of course you didn't.
No cop ever does anything wrong.

494
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,312
Will the plaintiff
please refrain from

495
00:19:36,399 --> 00:19:37,773
addressing
my client directly?

496
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:39,820
Enough.
I love a dramatic turn.

497
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:41,249
Let's watch.

498
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:42,982
Now, this is all about
perspective,

499
00:19:43,069 --> 00:19:45,892
and from this perspective,
you can clearly see.

500
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:49,142
Officer Nolan knock
my client to the ground.

501
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,232
Okay. Wait. It's... uh,
clearly from this angle,

502
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,272
it looks egregious,
but...

503
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,732
Egregious? I'd say it looks
like you deserve a flag

504
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:58,272
for roughing the pedestrian.

505
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,307
Your Honor, can we take
a brief recess?

506
00:20:00,395 --> 00:20:02,255
Make it quick.

507
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:06,311
This is crazy.
I didn't do anything wrong.

508
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:08,917
It doesn't matter. We've got
an unpredictable judge,

509
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:10,605
and that video just made
our case more difficult,

510
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:14,120
so I really need you to sit back
and let me do my job. Got it?

511
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,291
Got it.

512
00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:16,817
Come on.

513
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,747
Go ahead.
Have a seat on the bench.

514
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:24,137
Don't I get a lawyer?

515
00:20:24,225 --> 00:20:25,948
Did you want a lawyer?

516
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:28,323
Yeah.
But you took all my money.

517
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:30,198
Yeah, it was stolen money.

518
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:31,522
You know, it doesn't matter,

519
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:33,809
because your lawyer
would be pro bono.

520
00:20:34,752 --> 00:20:36,171
Free.

521
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:41,312
I've got just the guy
for you.

522
00:20:41,399 --> 00:20:43,518
- Mr. Camel.
- It's just "Camel."

523
00:20:43,606 --> 00:20:46,942
You know, like Beyoncé
or Post Malone.

524
00:20:47,114 --> 00:20:49,463
All right.
Let's start somewhere simple.

525
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:51,299
Why is there marker
on your face?

526
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:52,815
So Petey wouldn't know
it was me.

527
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,526
That's Peter DiAmato,

528
00:20:54,614 --> 00:20:56,784
the cashier at the convenience
store you robbed.

529
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:58,409
Robbery? Wait a minute.

530
00:20:58,497 --> 00:21:00,284
My client was wielding
a squirt gun...

531
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:02,153
Hardly qualifies as
a "threat of force."

532
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,833
It looked real.

533
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:09,963
It... It had Hawaiian Punch
in it,

534
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,942
which he drank repeatedly
during the alleged incident.

535
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:14,909
And the theft of $20
from the register?

536
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:16,270
Petey owed me that money.

537
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,534
Sounds like a harmless prank,

538
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:20,262
misunderstanding
between friends.

539
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,250
Prank, huh?

540
00:21:21,338 --> 00:21:23,708
Well, comedy is subjective.

541
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:27,911
Who keeps rubbing my foot?

542
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,661
All right.
Say I let him walk.

543
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,255
What do I get?

544
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:43,630
I've got 15 minutes.

545
00:21:43,718 --> 00:21:45,341
Don't worry.
I'm good under pressure.

546
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:46,928
Oh, good.

547
00:21:52,748 --> 00:21:54,404
Bishop?

548
00:21:55,227 --> 00:21:57,777
Why are you digging into known
associates of Terry Wright?

549
00:21:57,865 --> 00:21:59,435
When we stopped by for
the field interview,

550
00:21:59,522 --> 00:22:01,182
I got a strong sense
that he's up to something.

551
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:04,137
See, look. This station's
under a microscope.

552
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:05,903
The last thing I need
is one of my officers

553
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,812
getting slapped with
a harassment complaint.

554
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:09,496
If you have something real,
great.

555
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:10,602
Send it to Metro.

556
00:22:10,689 --> 00:22:12,480
Otherwise, get back
on the street.

557
00:22:12,568 --> 00:22:14,006
Yes, sir.

558
00:22:16,438 --> 00:22:18,709
<i>7-Adam-15,
assault in progress.</i>

559
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,623
Rustic Ranch Paintball.

560
00:22:22,102 --> 00:22:24,184
Hey, Officer, over here.
Over here.

561
00:22:24,272 --> 00:22:26,129
He's totally
lost his mind.

562
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:27,238
- Who?
- Jimmy.

563
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:28,658
He lives for paintball,
but he takes it

564
00:22:28,745 --> 00:22:29,816
way too seriously.

565
00:22:29,904 --> 00:22:32,026
Carl snuck up behind him
and scored,

566
00:22:32,114 --> 00:22:33,939
and then Jimmy freaked out
and started attacking...

567
00:22:34,026 --> 00:22:35,844
Okay. Slow down.
Who's Jimmy? Who's Carl?

568
00:22:35,932 --> 00:22:37,159
That's Carl.

569
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:40,985
Whoa. Um...
did you call an ambulance?

570
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:42,243
Yeah, yeah.
They're on the way.

571
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,392
Okay.
Keep pressure on it.

572
00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:44,852
Whatever you do,
don't pull it out.

573
00:22:44,939 --> 00:22:46,682
Where's this other guy,
Jimmy?

574
00:22:46,769 --> 00:22:48,482
Well, he's out there
playing somewhere.

575
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:49,624
How can we ID him?

576
00:22:49,712 --> 00:22:50,892
Uh, he's about 6' tall,

577
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:52,984
he's got a camo jacket,
and a skeleton face guard.

578
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,112
All right. You stay here
and wait for the ambulance.

579
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:59,982
It's scary what happens when
a man focuses on one thing only.

580
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,724
It's a cautionary tale,
really.

581
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:03,207
Shut it, Boot.

582
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,935
Yes, sir.

583
00:23:05,023 --> 00:23:08,404
All the new video does is show
us why magic tricks work.

584
00:23:08,545 --> 00:23:10,925
The magician doesn't really
saw the woman in half,

585
00:23:11,052 --> 00:23:14,162
and Officer Nolan didn't really
knock Mr. Lynch to the ground.

586
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:16,136
So the only
reasonable outcome here

587
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:17,715
is to dismiss this case
with prejudice,

588
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:19,708
citing Salsbury, Ritter,
and Bennett v. Long Beach.

589
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:21,602
Well put, young man.

590
00:23:21,689 --> 00:23:23,272
This...
This isn't right.

591
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:24,942
My pain is real.

592
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:26,981
Time after time,
police have gotten away

593
00:23:27,069 --> 00:23:28,942
with their crimes against me.

594
00:23:29,216 --> 00:23:31,442
My dog was run over
in a high-speed chase,

595
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:32,982
and my door was kicked in

596
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:34,732
by cops serving a warrant
on the wrong address.

597
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:38,142
And not one officer has had
the decency to just say,

598
00:23:38,229 --> 00:23:39,834
"I'm sorry."

599
00:23:40,399 --> 00:23:41,852
Is this why you're suing me?

600
00:23:41,939 --> 00:23:43,613
Because no one's ever
apologized to you?

601
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:44,942
Officer Nolan...
Let me be the first.

602
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:49,021
I'm sorry that you got hurt.
Off...

603
00:23:49,123 --> 00:23:50,996
Well, Your Honor,
in light of the defendant's

604
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:52,827
admission of guilt...
What?

605
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:55,578
...the plaintiff ups our
financial demand to $100,000.

606
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:56,829
Wait.
Your Honor,

607
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:58,231
we need
a 15-minute recess.

608
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,045
Yeah, you do.

609
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,892
Man, this would be
a whole lot easier

610
00:24:08,979 --> 00:24:10,217
if everyone
wasn't wearing camo.

611
00:24:10,304 --> 00:24:11,716
This job isn't about
easy, Boot.

612
00:24:11,804 --> 00:24:13,717
Have you ever done this?
Played paintball?

613
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:15,418
No. It's amateur hour.

614
00:24:15,506 --> 00:24:17,141
I'd straight up
murder these guys.

615
00:24:17,229 --> 00:24:18,966
- Okay.
- <i>That's him, that's him!</i>

616
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:21,692
Exhibit A.

617
00:24:21,997 --> 00:24:23,490
She thinks approaching
from the rear

618
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:24,600
gives her a tactical advantage.

619
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:27,101
But in reality, had she
taken the superior position

620
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:28,959
of the high ground
to the north...

621
00:24:30,131 --> 00:24:31,230
Oh!

622
00:24:31,318 --> 00:24:32,300
...that wouldn't
have happened.

623
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:33,562
Oh.

624
00:24:33,662 --> 00:24:35,333
But we know Jimmy's
not your average player.

625
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,623
This game is his life.
So where would he go?

626
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:41,490
Hmm. Somewhere with
a protected view of the course?

627
00:24:41,826 --> 00:24:44,060
Huh. High ground.

628
00:24:49,085 --> 00:24:50,482
LAPD!

629
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,826
Anyone else fires,
they're going to jail.

630
00:24:52,914 --> 00:24:54,867
- Okay. Sorry.
- <i>Guys, guns down.</i>

631
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:58,312
Guy in the skeleton mask?

632
00:24:58,399 --> 00:24:59,584
Behind you!

633
00:24:59,672 --> 00:25:01,656
Jimmy!

634
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:10,711
Commander.

635
00:25:13,077 --> 00:25:14,398
About before.

636
00:25:14,984 --> 00:25:16,539
I was out of line.

637
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:18,681
It's hard having a cop
for a son,

638
00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:21,546
especially when you know
what this job can do to him.

639
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,109
All good.
Water under the bridge.

640
00:25:25,272 --> 00:25:26,554
Good.

641
00:25:27,439 --> 00:25:28,937
Have a good day.

642
00:25:31,507 --> 00:25:32,867
Something else?

643
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:43,171
You didn't hear this
from me, okay?

644
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,623
Make sure they can bounce
a quarter off your bunk.

645
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,742
- You hear me?
- What do you mean by that?

646
00:25:49,305 --> 00:25:53,218
Detective Jenkins,
this Brady List business...

647
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,204
It isn't going away
anytime soon.

648
00:25:55,399 --> 00:25:57,272
The police commission
is stepping in.

649
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,642
We're talking review boards
and independent audits.

650
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:04,576
It could get ugly, Wade,
so double-check your officers.

651
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:06,375
Leave nothing to chance.

652
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,336
Make sure nothing can
blow back on you.

653
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:12,375
Thanks for the heads-up.

654
00:26:23,497 --> 00:26:26,086
Come on, Dylan.
Prove me wrong.

655
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:31,165
You done?

656
00:26:31,253 --> 00:26:32,810
No.
Just wanted to let you know

657
00:26:32,898 --> 00:26:34,133
there's no rush
getting back here.

658
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,328
Thanks for the update.

659
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,287
What are you up to?

660
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,414
Getting my nails done.

661
00:26:37,502 --> 00:26:38,429
That's a joke, right?

662
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:39,563
Look, did you actually
want something

663
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,982
or you just called
to say hi?

664
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:42,398
I think I'm gonna lose.

665
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:44,539
It doesn't mean
you did anything wrong.

666
00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:49,687
Crap.
Nolan, I got to go.

667
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:50,859
What's going on?
You okay?

668
00:26:50,947 --> 00:26:52,234
Everything's fine.

669
00:26:52,322 --> 00:26:53,985
Good luck with
your arbitration.

670
00:27:02,192 --> 00:27:04,038
These two stay.

671
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,205
This one goes.

672
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:08,812
You, uh, got a minute?

673
00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:09,981
Sure.

674
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:13,153
You ready to tell me
what's going on?

675
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:17,508
Come on.

676
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:19,903
You can talk to me.
Always.

677
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,200
Lopez and I, um...

678
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:27,812
we arrested a man named
Oscar Hutchinson.

679
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,272
He told me stories
about you and him.

680
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,101
And, um...

681
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:35,169
And what?

682
00:27:37,479 --> 00:27:39,028
He said you were dirty.

683
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:42,182
And you believe the word
of a convicted felon,

684
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:44,120
a murderer,
over your own father?

685
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:49,143
No. No. I, um... I just...
I-I pulled the file.

686
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:50,505
You did what?

687
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:53,206
Boy, have you lost
your damn mind?!

688
00:27:53,294 --> 00:27:55,022
I'm not a boy.
I'm a police officer...

689
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:57,482
Well, not for long, if you
don't get your head straight.

690
00:27:57,569 --> 00:27:59,901
Remember, you're not just
accusing your father here,

691
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:01,817
you're accusing a superior.

692
00:28:02,708 --> 00:28:03,991
Yes, sir.

693
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,061
Oscar Hutchinson
is a habitual liar

694
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:09,102
with a history
of substance abuse,

695
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,253
not to mention
a personal grudge against me.

696
00:28:11,341 --> 00:28:12,982
You think there's a court
in this country

697
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:14,942
that would find
his testimony credible?

698
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:17,700
Look, I don't give a damn
if it would stand up in court.

699
00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:20,062
I want to know if it's true.

700
00:28:20,149 --> 00:28:21,614
Of course not!

701
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:26,075
And today of all days,
you throw this in my face?!

702
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:29,911
Get out of my sight.

703
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:48,022
Control, 7-Adam-15.

704
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:52,352
I need a premise history
on 11215 South 73rd Street.

705
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,920
<i>Copy. Stand by.</i>

706
00:28:55,497 --> 00:28:57,610
<i>Okay. Lots of 11-3
at that address.</i>

707
00:28:57,698 --> 00:28:59,991
<i>I'm getting a hazard code,
as well.</i>

708
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:06,982
7-Adam-15, show me
on a felony ped stop

709
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:09,522
in the alley beside
the South 73rd address.

710
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:11,872
I think they're about
to rob a stash house.

711
00:29:14,025 --> 00:29:15,786
Two at gunpoint.
Send backup.

712
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,567
Police!

713
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:27,319
Drop the weapons!

714
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,380
Three steps forward.

715
00:29:32,164 --> 00:29:33,630
On your knees.

716
00:29:35,625 --> 00:29:38,052
I told you not to run
with this fool.

717
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,153
I knew you looked familiar.

718
00:29:44,466 --> 00:29:47,022
Talia Bishop,
the prodigal sister.

719
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,153
And you led her right here.

720
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:50,864
Thought I taught you better.

721
00:29:50,952 --> 00:29:52,832
You should have taken
that second chance, Terry.

722
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:54,351
Now you're going
back to prison.

723
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,036
I don't think so.

724
00:30:04,196 --> 00:30:06,319
Holster your weapon.

725
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,763
Take off the belt.
Get it from her.

726
00:30:19,415 --> 00:30:20,958
You shouldn't have
followed me here.

727
00:30:21,046 --> 00:30:23,778
I should have just let you rob
a stash house and get killed?

728
00:30:29,414 --> 00:30:32,367
Yo. What do you want
to do with her?

729
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,231
She probably already
called for backup.

730
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:36,481
We better rob
this place fast.

731
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:39,364
Stick her in the van.
Make sure she's secure.

732
00:30:39,474 --> 00:30:41,142
Let's go.

733
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:47,852
Dylan, you don't have to
do this. Don't do this.

734
00:30:47,939 --> 00:30:49,982
Don't do this.
Dylan, it's not too late!

735
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:51,433
Dylan!

736
00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:19,566
TeGo, go, go, go, go!

737
00:31:22,529 --> 00:31:24,587
Where's Maurice?

738
00:31:25,069 --> 00:31:27,501
Dead. Hold on.

739
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:31,431
He needs to go
to a hospital.

740
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:32,739
Yeah, that's not happening.

741
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:34,794
Yeah, I'm...
I'm hit pretty bad, man.

742
00:31:34,882 --> 00:31:36,416
He could bleed out.
If you care about him,

743
00:31:36,503 --> 00:31:38,217
take him to the hospital.
You can just dump him out.

744
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:41,259
We're not going to any damn
hospital. Shut the hell up.

745
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:47,829
However I rule,
it's clear to me

746
00:31:47,917 --> 00:31:51,775
that Officer Nolan has a lot to
learn about the job of policing.

747
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,442
I have to take this.

748
00:31:56,529 --> 00:31:57,852
Like hell you do. You...

749
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,272
Yes, sir?

750
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:00,442
Bishop's missing.
She called for backup.

751
00:32:00,529 --> 00:32:02,022
When units arrived,

752
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:03,392
they found her car
outside a stash house,

753
00:32:03,479 --> 00:32:04,767
bodies inside.

754
00:32:04,855 --> 00:32:06,268
Officer,
hang up that phone!

755
00:32:06,356 --> 00:32:07,270
Have you heard from her?

756
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:08,528
No.
Get back here.

757
00:32:08,616 --> 00:32:10,149
Yes, sir. On my way.

758
00:32:10,383 --> 00:32:11,743
Officer Nolan,
we're not done here.

759
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,812
I am.
Do whatever you need to do.

760
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:15,602
Make it $1,000, $100,000,
$100 million.

761
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:17,704
I don't care.
My T.O.'s in trouble.

762
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:23,357
Dylan,
grab that sweatshirt.

763
00:32:24,658 --> 00:32:27,321
Tie it around your arm...
Above the wound.

764
00:32:27,532 --> 00:32:29,165
You got
to stop the bleeding.

765
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:31,562
What's the plan?

766
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,563
I'm working on it.

767
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:35,468
Man, Maurice is dead.

768
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:37,461
We're riding around this van
with a kidnapped cop.

769
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:39,001
What kind of plan
fixes this?

770
00:32:39,089 --> 00:32:40,382
One that includes
killing me.

771
00:32:40,569 --> 00:32:41,852
Shut up!

772
00:32:41,939 --> 00:32:43,852
He's not gonna hurt you.

773
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:45,272
Where do you think
we're driving to?

774
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:47,562
Quiet place where
he can execute a cop.

775
00:32:47,649 --> 00:32:49,156
Isn't that right, Terry?!

776
00:32:49,244 --> 00:32:50,710
We're not killing her.

777
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:53,501
Just relax, Dylan.
I know what to do.

778
00:32:53,689 --> 00:32:55,827
Everything's gonna be fine.

779
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:01,984
Uncuff her from the van.

780
00:33:22,439 --> 00:33:25,729
Look, whatever happens next,
Dylan, I am sorry.

781
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:29,569
Even though I couldn't
keep you in my life,

782
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,920
I still kept my eye on you.

783
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:35,182
I saw you turn
your life around.

784
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:37,718
I know I let you down.

785
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,813
But this... this is...
This isn't you.

786
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,682
You are so much better
than this thug.

787
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:46,515
Don't listen to her.

788
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:48,226
Who taught you
how to be a man,

789
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,392
how to hustle, how to
survive on these streets?

790
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,193
I'm the closest thing to
family you've ever had.

791
00:33:55,396 --> 00:33:57,577
She doesn't deserve tears.

792
00:33:58,296 --> 00:34:00,648
Turn around.
You shouldn't have to see this.

793
00:34:00,736 --> 00:34:04,199
No. Come on. Let's...
Let's just leave her.

794
00:34:04,287 --> 00:34:05,602
Let's just get the hell
out of here.

795
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:09,671
We can't do that.
Just turn around.

796
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,351
Dylan, I love you.

797
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:23,061
I'm sorry!

798
00:34:26,361 --> 00:34:27,564
Get on your knees.

799
00:34:27,652 --> 00:34:29,735
Man, I'm not
getting on my knees.

800
00:34:29,823 --> 00:34:31,066
You gonna shoot me,

801
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:32,976
you gonna look me in my face
when you do it.

802
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,026
Dylan, Dylan,
look at me.

803
00:34:45,114 --> 00:34:46,684
Breathe. Breathe.
It's okay.

804
00:34:46,772 --> 00:34:47,935
Come uncuff me.

805
00:34:48,023 --> 00:34:50,215
Come on. Uncuff me.

806
00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:55,426
What did I do?

807
00:34:56,954 --> 00:34:58,617
You saved me.

808
00:35:13,911 --> 00:35:15,184
What are you doing?

809
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:17,234
I'm sorry,
but I gotta take you in.

810
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:19,735
I just saved your life.
Save mine.

811
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:20,768
That's what I'm
trying to do!

812
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:22,190
Look, I'll go to Mexico.

813
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:23,223
I'll be gone by the morning.

814
00:35:23,311 --> 00:35:24,981
I swear, you'll never
hear from me again!

815
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:26,442
You know I can't.

816
00:35:26,664 --> 00:35:28,778
I can... I can keep
your secret.

817
00:35:29,482 --> 00:35:32,770
Yeah, w-with Terry dead,
no one else knows.

818
00:35:32,939 --> 00:35:35,356
It's perfect...
That doesn't matter anymore.

819
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:55,162
Control,
this is Officer Bishop.

820
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,573
I'm in Baldwin Hills
oil field.

821
00:35:57,661 --> 00:36:01,124
I have one in custody,
one deceased.

822
00:36:01,212 --> 00:36:04,955
Please send additional units,
an RA, and a supervisor.

823
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:18,395
Hey.
I was looking for you.

824
00:36:18,953 --> 00:36:19,926
You okay?

825
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:21,176
I... yeah.

826
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:22,755
Why didn't you tell me
you were into something?

827
00:36:22,842 --> 00:36:23,606
I would have
been there for you.

828
00:36:23,694 --> 00:36:25,057
You had your own life
to deal with.

829
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:26,341
Yeah, well, I hate
to break it to you,

830
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:27,785
but you're a pretty big
part of that these days.

831
00:36:27,872 --> 00:36:28,810
Lucky you.

832
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:31,153
Yes. I am lucky.

833
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:35,473
Look, I don't know what's
going on with you,

834
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:39,239
and I don't know who this
Dylan guy you arrested is.

835
00:36:39,327 --> 00:36:41,434
All I know is there's
got to be a reason

836
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:43,465
you're playing it
close to the vest.

837
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,567
And I respect that.

838
00:36:46,396 --> 00:36:48,973
But take it from a guy
who bottled things up

839
00:36:49,061 --> 00:36:50,879
for too many years.

840
00:36:51,654 --> 00:36:53,404
It helps to talk about it.

841
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:56,840
You're right.

842
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:59,282
I do need to talk.

843
00:36:59,942 --> 00:37:01,723
But not to you.

844
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:10,653
Come in.

845
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,893
Sir, I have something
to tell you.

846
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:17,559
What is it?

847
00:37:18,184 --> 00:37:20,270
Dylan Scott is my brother.

848
00:37:22,818 --> 00:37:24,271
Come again?

849
00:37:24,414 --> 00:37:26,950
We spent a year together
in the same foster home,

850
00:37:27,718 --> 00:37:30,411
a year that felt like
a lifetime.

851
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:34,918
I wouldn't have made it
one day without him.

852
00:37:35,023 --> 00:37:38,825
Bishop. Where are you
going with this?

853
00:37:39,284 --> 00:37:42,237
I left him off of my P.H.Q.
when I applied to the academy

854
00:37:42,325 --> 00:37:43,723
because of his
criminal record.

855
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:45,153
I pretended like
he didn't exist,

856
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,801
and that was a mistake.

857
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,856
It doesn't matter we only
spent a year together.

858
00:37:50,922 --> 00:37:52,598
He's family.

859
00:37:55,677 --> 00:37:57,481
If this was any other day,

860
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:01,418
I might have the energy
to chew you out

861
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:03,911
or figure out how to help.

862
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:08,020
But today...
Today, my hands are tied.

863
00:38:08,177 --> 00:38:10,920
So I have to file
a memorandum with the Chief,

864
00:38:11,233 --> 00:38:13,816
informing him that one
of my best officers

865
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:17,212
perjured herself on
an official document,

866
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:19,864
likely torpedoing
her career.

867
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,324
You're dismissed.

868
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,803
We need to talk.

869
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:35,053
I'm off-duty, Commander.
Maybe another time.

870
00:38:35,214 --> 00:38:37,972
Jackson, please.

871
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:45,119
So I've been doing a lot
of apologizing today.

872
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:46,472
I'm not used to that.

873
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:48,511
I'm not really
good at it either.

874
00:38:48,991 --> 00:38:50,816
Was that your way
of saying sorry?

875
00:38:51,347 --> 00:38:52,893
No, no.

876
00:38:53,246 --> 00:38:56,308
This is. I'm sorry.

877
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,160
Why?

878
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,496
You swore that
you weren't dirty.

879
00:39:01,684 --> 00:39:03,144
And I wasn't.

880
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:06,143
Look,
you have to understand,

881
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,584
when I was coming up
in the force,

882
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:09,136
it was a different time.

883
00:39:09,231 --> 00:39:12,019
Two weeks to match fingerprints,
if you were lucky.

884
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,011
And forget about
DNA evidence.

885
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:17,050
We cut corners sometimes
because we had to.

886
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:22,093
My whole life, you drilled me
to follow every single rule

887
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,303
to the letter.

888
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,593
And now it's, "Oh, yeah,

889
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,433
we cut corners
'cause we had to."

890
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,371
Who the hell do you
think you are?

891
00:39:30,378 --> 00:39:31,957
Your father.

892
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:34,667
Not the one that
I thought you were.

893
00:39:34,824 --> 00:39:36,737
Look, I don't know what
Oscar told you

894
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:38,818
or what you think
I might have done,

895
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:41,105
but I swear to you,
I wasn't dirty.

896
00:39:41,193 --> 00:39:43,396
I knew plenty who were,
but that wasn't me.

897
00:39:43,605 --> 00:39:46,598
I never falsified evidence.
Never took money.

898
00:39:46,686 --> 00:39:49,238
Never flaked a guy
to make a collar.

899
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,180
You have to believe me.

900
00:39:54,745 --> 00:39:57,566
No, Dad. I don't.

901
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,996
Jackson, please.

902
00:40:04,425 --> 00:40:07,949
All I ever wanted was for you
to be better than I was.

903
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:16,473
Hey.

904
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:17,723
Are you okay?

905
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:19,511
Not really.

906
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:21,767
I'm sorry, but maybe
this will cheer you up.

907
00:40:21,855 --> 00:40:23,019
Come on.

908
00:40:23,107 --> 00:40:25,042
I spoke to the building super
about Samantha,

909
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,746
told him everything
she'd gone through.

910
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:28,548
So he agreed to withdraw
his complaint.

911
00:40:28,651 --> 00:40:30,245
- She's free to go.
- That's great.

912
00:40:30,395 --> 00:40:31,785
There's more.

913
00:40:32,979 --> 00:40:34,613
Mrs. Bennett?

914
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:35,978
Can we get a minute?

915
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,488
Yeah.
Thanks.

916
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,683
I found your husband.

917
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:41,512
I explained to him
what happened,

918
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,853
that you were innocent.

919
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,660
It was a lot to process.

920
00:40:44,857 --> 00:40:46,302
Before you get your hopes up,

921
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,893
he doesn't want you
to know where he

922
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,488
or your daughter are
just yet.

923
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:51,699
But I gave him this number,

924
00:40:52,106 --> 00:40:55,285
and I think he'll call once he
wraps his head around the truth.

925
00:40:56,691 --> 00:40:59,128
Thank you.
Thank you.

926
00:40:59,285 --> 00:41:00,405

Nope.

931

No.
The judge tossed it.

Wow!
Nicely done.

00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:38,343
