<i>♪ I can still taste you
on my lips ♪</i>

2
00:00:08,781 --> 00:00:10,086
It's just not a term

3
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:12,781
you expect to hear
in 2019, you know?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,953
"Grave robber."

5
00:00:15,202 --> 00:00:18,197
It's like chimney sweep.

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,110
Alchemist.

7
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,852
- Fishmonger.
- Keep naming old-ass jobs

8
00:00:23,938 --> 00:00:25,446
and your next one's gonna be
at Medieval Times.

9
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:27,070
Copy that.

10
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,400
There he is.

11
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:31,703
If he starts digging up
body parts to make a monster,

12
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:33,391
you're on your own.

13
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:37,069
Police!

14
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,045
Geez. You scared me.

15
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:41,287
- Get out of there.
- It's okay. This is my mom.

16
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:43,070
And you missed her so much
you had to dig her up?

17
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:44,975
No,
she's got my jewelry.

18
00:00:45,162 --> 00:00:46,515
She was supposed
to leave it to me,

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,764
but they buried her with it,
and now I need it.

20
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,045
To buy drugs?

21
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:51,100
No.

22
00:00:51,186 --> 00:00:52,483
Okay.
Come on. Come on.

23
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:54,076
Climb on out
of there.

24
00:00:54,257 --> 00:00:56,092
Hands over your head.

25
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:58,287
Interlace
your fingers.

26
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:01,256
I really do miss her.

27
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:04,014
She's the only person
that ever believed in me.

28
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:06,115
I've been so lost
since she's been dead.

29
00:01:06,201 --> 00:01:08,397
Then maybe you should this
as an opportunity

30
00:01:08,483 --> 00:01:09,608
to get
your life straight.

31
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,900
You know what?
Get clean.

32
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:13,492
Make your mother
proud.

33
00:01:13,663 --> 00:01:14,958
Yeah.

34
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:16,796
Yeah,
I'm going to do that.

35
00:01:17,022 --> 00:01:18,756
I'm gonna
turn my life around.

36
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:20,416
I'm gonna get clean.

37
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:21,881
For Mom!

38
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,296
It's gonna be one
of those nights, isn't it?

39
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:29,805
Yep.

40
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,420
Come on. Get up.

41
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,617
Come on. I got ya.

42
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,664
Come on.

43
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:41,688
What?

44
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:44,123
She's over there.

45
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,086
I remember that statue
from the funeral.

46
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,079
I'll put him in the shop.

47
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,125
It still doesn't
feel real.

48
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,578
Yeah.

49
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:04,102
But life goes on
whether we like it or not.

50
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:10,531
Okay.
Back to it.

51
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:29,969
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE ROOKIE*</font>

53
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:37,876
Oh, I could
get used to this.

54
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:39,126
Right?

55
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:40,916
They don't have this
in D.C.

56
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:43,416
Nope. Just an equal amount
of self-absorbed people.

57
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:44,916
Mm-hmm. Only they're
far more pale.

58
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,256
Yes.

59
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:47,916
Which is why
you should spend

60
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,376
more than a few days a month
down here with me.

61
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,626
Oh,
I wish I could.

62
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:55,166
But I landed this big
security contract in Virginia.

63
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:57,086
Nice.
Which reminds me.

64
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:59,296
Um, there's this thing
that I heard about

65
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:02,256
that I think...
you should volunteer for.

66
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:03,876
I love volunteering
for things.

67
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:05,416
What's the thing?

68
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,836
Well, uh, a friend of mine
is an ADA out here,

69
00:03:08,921 --> 00:03:10,086
and he mentioned
that he's gonna be

70
00:03:10,171 --> 00:03:12,046
reaching out to your station
for manpower

71
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,466
for a protection detail.

72
00:03:13,551 --> 00:03:16,626
Some high-powered witness
in a safe house.

73
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:17,966
Sounds like fun.

74
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:20,055
And some
valuable experience.

75
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,045
How can I ever
thank you?

76
00:03:22,131 --> 00:03:24,966
Oh, I'm sure I will think
of a few ways.

77
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:27,727
I'm sure you will.

78
00:03:28,131 --> 00:03:31,125
We're talking about sex, though, right?
Yeah.

79
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:33,336
Per Captain Weatherby,

80
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:37,055
the following protocol changes
will take place immediately.

81
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:39,626
No more putting any boots
on top of lockers.

82
00:03:39,711 --> 00:03:41,586
Any boots left on top of lockers

83
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:44,586
will be thrown away
at midnight and noon daily.

84
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:47,376
Second, every officer
must provide a business card

85
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,416
to every citizen
they contact.

86
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,336
If a citizen doesn't want
a business card,

87
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:53,256
the officer must write
a police report

88
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:57,466
and document the fact the
citizen refused a business card.

89
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:59,586
Sir, with all due respect,
this sucks.

90
00:03:59,727 --> 00:04:02,796
Ours is not to judge,
Officer Lopez.

91
00:04:02,881 --> 00:04:05,336
Command believes that the
captain's focus on efficiency

92
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:07,680
is what Mid-Wilshire
needs right now.

93
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:12,559
Captain.
Can I help you?

94
00:04:12,715 --> 00:04:14,805
I need an updated
vehicle list.

95
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,586
Yes, sir. I'm in the middle
of roll call.

96
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:17,921
I'll get it to you
right after.

97
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:20,382
But since you're here,
would you like to

98
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,281
say anything inspirational
to day shift?

99
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:28,188
Did you tell them
about the boots?

100
00:04:28,513 --> 00:04:31,388
Yes, sir.
Oh. Okay.

101
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:33,134
Well, uh...

102
00:04:35,001 --> 00:04:36,961
Keep up the, uh...

103
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:39,842
good work.

104
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,898
Alright.

105
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:48,898
Last bit of business.

106
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,347
District Attorney's office
has a witness on ice.

107
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:54,453
They need our help
watching them.

108
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,756
I usually don't assign rookies

109
00:04:56,841 --> 00:04:58,796
these type of details,
Officer Nolan.

110
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,756
And Officer Bishop
would have to agree.

111
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:05,166
Forget it. Protection details
are like watching paint dry.

112
00:05:05,251 --> 00:05:06,756
Looks like
you're out of luck.

113
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:07,984
I'll do it.

114
00:05:09,068 --> 00:05:11,915
And Nolan and I haven't had
a chance to "bond" yet.

115
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:16,376
Great.

116
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:18,566
Alright. Bishop,
you'll be riding with Chen.

117
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,086
That's it.

118
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:22,256
Oh, and remember...

119
00:05:22,341 --> 00:05:24,436
when you take
your shops in at night,

120
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,566
you now have to
drive by the garage

121
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:30,106
to get a mechanical inspection
and mileage report.

122
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:31,805
You're welcome.

123
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,946
You're right,
this sucks.

124
00:05:34,157 --> 00:05:36,436
For you. 'Cause I'll be home eating
dinner while you're doing all that.

125
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:39,340
<i>Officer West
to the front desk. Visitor.</i>

126
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:41,046
I'll be right back.

127
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:44,149
Make it fast. Captain's put
a clock on our roll out.

128
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,247
Hey.
Hey.

129
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:50,403
Um, what are you
doing here?

130
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,731
You... left something
at my place.

131
00:05:52,817 --> 00:05:56,090
Um, I just can't
really have visitors here.

132
00:05:56,176 --> 00:05:58,301
Look, I just...
I just really want to keep

133
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,762
my personal and work life
separate.

134
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:03,161
Fine.

135
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:06,082
You left your off-duty weapon
at my place.

136
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:09,731
I can't believe
I did that.

137
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:11,676
Yeah, you were
a little distracted.

138
00:06:12,097 --> 00:06:13,254
Look,
you don't understand.

139
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:15,270
If anybody found out
about this, I'd get fired.

140
00:06:15,356 --> 00:06:16,473
Immediately.

141
00:06:16,559 --> 00:06:17,857
And, like, what...
Why would you bring it here?

142
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:19,301
What if you got
pulled over?

143
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:20,702
You're mad at me
about this?

144
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,465
No, look...

145
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:23,855
I got to get to work.

146
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:25,786
I'm sorry, Gino.
I...

147
00:06:25,977 --> 00:06:27,162
Yeah.

148
00:06:27,341 --> 00:06:29,317
Hey, Boot.
What's the holdup?

149
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:31,801
Uh, nothing.
Sorry.

150
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:34,255
I just...
Actually, can I, uh...

151
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:36,341
Can I just get a minute?
I need to hit the locker room.

152
00:06:36,442 --> 00:06:38,825
30 seconds or I fail you
for the day.

153
00:06:43,434 --> 00:06:45,179
Must have left
his boots up.

154
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:47,325
You up to date
on protection detail protocols?

155
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,436
I think so. Okay. We use
the "Loser System"...

156
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:50,986
Named for the losers
we protect.

157
00:06:51,071 --> 00:06:54,256
L-O-S-R... Listen, Observe,
Secure, Report.

158
00:06:54,341 --> 00:06:55,756
You listen
for any movement,

159
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,966
changes or information
that impact the mission,

160
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,325
observe
the subject's behavior,

161
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:01,295
changes in the environment,
et cetera.

162
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:03,942
Secure... make sure no threats
infiltrate the perimeter,

163
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:05,445
and, finally, report.

164
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:08,065
Report any suspicious activity,
no matter how minor,

165
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,986
to your superior officer
immediately.

166
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:12,233
- That means me.
- What about "e"?

167
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,275
"Loser" has an "e."

168
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,585
"E" is for "engage,"
which is left out

169
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,126
because you are not
to engage the subject

170
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:19,646
unless it's
a life-threatening emergency.

171
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,916
We're here
to guard this guy,

172
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,248
not braid his hair
and be besties.

173
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,665
- That understood?
- Understood.

174
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:24,880
I don't even know
how to braid hair.

175
00:07:24,965 --> 00:07:26,965
I was gonna learn if we had
a daughter, but...

176
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,059
Never mind.

177
00:07:35,936 --> 00:07:37,266
Police!

178
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:41,255
You alright?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

179
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:42,849
Thanks. He got me
when I wasn't looking.

180
00:07:42,934 --> 00:07:44,958
You're under arrest
for assaulting an officer.

181
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:46,605
He's the one
who should be arrested.

182
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:49,416
He said he'd rip up the ticket
if I gave him $100.

183
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:50,966
- That's not true.
- Like hell it isn't! Hey!

184
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:52,365
Sir, there's no use in lying.
Alright?

185
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,701
Whatever really happened
is gonna be on

186
00:07:53,786 --> 00:07:55,192
the officer's
body camera.

187
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,848
Where's
your body camera?

188
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:00,965
Um...

189
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:02,776
it's, uh...
It's in the car.

190
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:05,226
It was on the fritz.
I'll... I'll go get it.

191
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:11,225
Officer, wait!

192
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:18,331
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car now!

193
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,936
- Okay, take it easy. Take...
- Get out of the car.

194
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:21,256
Take it easy, man.
Come on.

195
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:22,326
Interlace your fingers
and face

196
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:23,881
- the car.
- Okay, okay, okay.

197
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:26,870
It's just
a big misunderstanding.

198
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:28,638
Can't we just... Can't we just
talk this out, you know?

199
00:08:28,723 --> 00:08:30,408
Cop to cop?
You're not a cop.

200
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:32,644
And impersonating a law
enforcement officer is a felony.

201
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,870
I want a lawyer.

202
00:08:34,024 --> 00:08:35,706
Maybe you
can impersonate one.

203
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:44,647
That's the safe house.

204
00:08:45,032 --> 00:08:47,399
7-Adam-19 on scene
at the mutual aid call.

205
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:48,776
Will make contact
in 10 seconds.

206
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,266
<i>Roger, 7-Adam-19.</i>

207
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,917
LAPD,
Bradford and Nolan.

208
00:08:58,762 --> 00:09:00,927
- Uh, Officer Nolan?
- Nolan.

209
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:02,588
Hey,
I'm ADA Sean DelMonte.

210
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:04,489
Jessica Russo told me
you'd be helping out.

211
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:06,160
Sir, Officer Nolan
is a rookie.

212
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,457
I'm his superior officer,
Tim Bradford.

213
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,582
Oh. Sorry. I just assumed
that he'd be in charge.

214
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,205
The last guy Jessica dated
was a Navy SEAL. Seriously?

215
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,686
Yeah. Talk about a strong
handshake, like a vise grip...

216
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:18,611
Okay, can we get the download
on our protectee?

217
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:20,620
Of course. Yeah.

218
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:22,293
Brad Hayes.

219
00:09:22,551 --> 00:09:25,065
Worked Border Patrol
for 12 years down in Temecula.

220
00:09:25,151 --> 00:09:26,902
Rose to second in command.

221
00:09:27,051 --> 00:09:28,966
Then he turned around and
started using what we taught him

222
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:30,332
to help the other side.

223
00:09:30,418 --> 00:09:33,621
He charged the cartels a fortune
to smuggle people in and out.

224
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:35,097
Now he's naming names.

225
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,380
No wonder he's
hiding out here.

226
00:09:36,465 --> 00:09:39,150
Yeah, he's testifying
before a grand jury tomorrow.

227
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:41,793
Look, Sheriff's Department
will coordinate shift changes.

228
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,966
Here's my card.

229
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:44,614
Use the cell number
in case anything comes up,

230
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:45,646
no matter how small.

231
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:47,416
Will do.
Deputy.

232
00:09:47,501 --> 00:09:48,666
It's very nice to meet
both of you.

233
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:49,936
And, again,
sorry for the confusion.

234
00:09:50,021 --> 00:09:51,480
No worries.

235
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,787
- Navy SEAL?
- Focus, Boot.

236
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:57,078
Now do a sweep
of the house.

237
00:09:57,171 --> 00:09:58,336
Note ingress
and egress points,

238
00:09:58,421 --> 00:09:59,606
escape avenues,
and sight lines.

239
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:01,936
Report back in 10.
Yes, sir.

240
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:06,136
- How's it going?
- Fine. Thanks.

241
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:08,801
Oh.

242
00:10:09,226 --> 00:10:10,785
No "e" in "loser."

243
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:14,371
Hey.

244
00:10:14,964 --> 00:10:16,941
There is an "e"
in "loser."

245
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,775
<i>7-Adam-15,
false imprisonment call,</i>

246
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:23,896
6991 West Ellroy.

247
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:25,652
Code 2 high.

248
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,145
She's got him
locked up in there!

249
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:31,726
I haven't been able
to reach him in days.

250
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:33,166
- Who?
- My boyfriend.

251
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:34,526
Who's got him
locked up?

252
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:36,084
His mother.

253
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:38,086
His mother?

254
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,506
Look, no offense,
but could it be

255
00:10:39,591 --> 00:10:40,986
that he just doesn't
want to see you?

256
00:10:41,071 --> 00:10:42,466
No,
she's really strict,

257
00:10:42,551 --> 00:10:44,295
and she hates
that we're together.

258
00:10:44,387 --> 00:10:47,021
Please,
I'm really worried.

259
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:51,951
Police, open up!

260
00:10:52,662 --> 00:10:54,710
Police!

261
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:00,204
Wait! I have a key!

262
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,725
I have a key.
Thanks.

263
00:11:02,021 --> 00:11:03,500
Stay back.

264
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:19,244
Stop, Mom!
Please!

265
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,783
...who sustains my life.

266
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,466
Turn back the evil
upon my foes;

267
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,256
in your faithfulness,
destroy them.

268
00:11:28,341 --> 00:11:31,206
And by the power
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

269
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,936
may you be snatched away

270
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:36,002
and driven from
the church of God.

271
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,822
From all the souls made
in the image and likeness of God

272
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:44,837
and redeemed by the Precious
Blood of the Divine Lamb,

273
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:46,933
- I cast you out!
- Ow!

274
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:48,267
Stop!
Get away from him!

275
00:11:48,353 --> 00:11:49,869
- No. No!
- That's enough.

276
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:51,511
You have to let me
save him.

277
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:53,300
He's been possessed
by the dark one.

278
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:56,988
<i>Control, I need RA
to 6991 West Ellroy.</i>

279
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,814
<i>Teenage Hispanic male,
suffering from dehydration.</i>

280
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,243
What did you do to him,
you sick bitch?!

281
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:04,253
- Hey.
- No! No.

282
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:06,206
He's been
possessed by your filth.

283
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:07,362
No.

284
00:12:07,448 --> 00:12:08,995
No.

285
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,884
Sergeant.

286
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,095
Yes.

287
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:24,001
Did you countermand
my vehicle reassignment order?

288
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,056
I thought it
was a mistake.

289
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,071
You reassigned all
our extra shops to LAX.

290
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:31,439
What are we supposed to use
if one of our cars breaks down?

291
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:33,094
Inventory lists
10 mountain bikes.

292
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,571
We'll use those.
Yeah.

293
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:35,829
Exercise is good
for the soul.

294
00:12:35,915 --> 00:12:37,610
Less helpful in
a high-speed pursuit.

295
00:12:37,696 --> 00:12:39,289
I have got
a doctor's appointment

296
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:40,899
and then lunch
with the Deputy Chief.

297
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:43,321
So make sure those
monthly reports are on my desk

298
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:45,188
- when I get back.
- Yes, sir!

299
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:49,946
Wow.

300
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:52,704
- He seems fun.
- Damn.

301
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,321
What are you doing here?

302
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,758
Uh, your wife called me.
She said that you were considering

303
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,205
throwing the new captain
out the window.

304
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,603
And you came
to talk me out of it?

305
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:00,914
Or open the window.

306
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,399
Whichever one
seems more productive.

307
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:05,696
He's hurting morale

308
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:08,024
and our ability
to do our jobs.

309
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,868
He's not the first pencil pusher
you've worked for, right?

310
00:13:10,954 --> 00:13:12,524
And he probably
won't be the last.

311
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,961
So it is your job
to find a workaround.

312
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:21,891
You think the kid
will be okay?

313
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:24,329
Physically, yes,
but mentally, I'm not so sure.

314
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:27,196
I still can't believe a mother
would do that to her own son.

315
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:29,454
Sadly, it's not the worst thing
I've seen a parent do.

316
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,844
Oh, uh, hey.

317
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,547
Do you mind
if I take this call?

318
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:34,070
- Mm.
- Thanks.

319
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:37,908
Wh... What?

320
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,437
Mom, slow down.

321
00:13:39,523 --> 00:13:41,047
W... Is he okay?

322
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,218
Did they send him
to Shaw Memorial?

323
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:46,476
Okay.
Yeah, no, that's good.

324
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:48,343
My dad got attacked
by one of his patients.

325
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:49,984
They think
his arm is broken.

326
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:55,578
I'll go as soon as
my shift's done, okay?

327
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:57,445
- Boot, we'll go now.
- Oh. Okay.

328
00:13:57,531 --> 00:13:58,914
I'm gonna go right now,

329
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,304
and I'll call you
right after I see him, okay?

330
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,508
I love you, too.

331
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:03,859
Um, thanks.

332
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:06,148
My mom is out of town
at a conference.

333
00:14:06,234 --> 00:14:07,859
Are you sure
this is okay?

334
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:09,510
Yeah. It's family.

335
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:11,180
Control,
have a unit meet us

336
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:12,992
at Shaw Memorial
for a prisoner transfer.

337
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:15,172
Also, show us
10-6 personal.

338
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:20,883
The whole house
is about 1,900 square feet.

339
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:22,471
Upstairs, there's
two bedrooms, a bathroom,

340
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:23,954
and a very small attic.

341
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,935
Sight lines are blocked
from the east...

342
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:27,586
I'm bored!

343
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,337
Not our problem.

344
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,195
Oh, it is killing me
not having Internet access.

345
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:34,977
Or a phone.

346
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,438
They actually gave me
newspapers.

347
00:14:37,524 --> 00:14:38,800
What do they think,
I'm an animal?

348
00:14:38,885 --> 00:14:40,650
Sir, we're here to keep you
alive, not entertained.

349
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:42,680
So step back.
Let us do our job.

350
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:44,134
He doesn't like me,
does he?

351
00:14:44,227 --> 00:14:45,720
He probably thinks
I'm a traitor.

352
00:14:45,806 --> 00:14:48,056
We're not here to judge you,
sir. Just keep you safe.

353
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,759
He's very good.
Very reassuring.

354
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:53,083
I'm gonna have a beer.
You guys want one?

355
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:55,220
No, thank you.
Shocker.

356
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:10,032
Officer Nolan.

357
00:15:10,124 --> 00:15:11,274
Yes, sir?

358
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,975
I read about you
in the newspaper.

359
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:15,209
Your captain got killed
in the line of duty.

360
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:19,907
- Sounded like a real badass.
- She was.

361
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,906
Your name was all over
that article.

362
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:23,900
Pretty heroic stuff.

363
00:15:25,385 --> 00:15:27,212
Not heroic enough.

364
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:31,590
<i>Respiratory therapist, 4 West.</i>

365
00:15:31,785 --> 00:15:34,720
<i>Respiratory therapist, 4 West.</i>

366
00:15:34,995 --> 00:15:36,501
Gino. Hey.

367
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:37,712
Uh, I'm looking
for my dad.

368
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:39,410
He was brought in a little while
ago... broken arm?

369
00:15:39,495 --> 00:15:41,352
Uh, yeah.
He's in Bed 2.

370
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,584
- I'm... I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, thanks.

371
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:46,496
Do we know
what his status is?

372
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,388
Doctor saw him
and scheduled him for X-rays.

373
00:15:48,474 --> 00:15:50,969
Depending how bad the break is,
he might need surgery.

374
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:53,430
Um, I'll goose
the process along.

375
00:15:53,515 --> 00:15:54,891
- Put in a room request.
- Thanks.

376
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:56,204
Yeah.

377
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:02,649
Hey.

378
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:03,880
Are you okay?

379
00:16:03,966 --> 00:16:05,860
I'm fine.

380
00:16:05,946 --> 00:16:07,551
Your mother shouldn't
have called you.

381
00:16:07,637 --> 00:16:09,922
Of course she should have.
What happened?

382
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:11,891
I was in the middle
of some alternative

383
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:13,530
anger management therapy,

384
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:15,800
and my patient
lost control.

385
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:17,063
What's his name?

386
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,254
Why?

387
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,485
Because
he broke your arm.

388
00:16:20,623 --> 00:16:23,555
No, he had
a dissociative episode.

389
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:24,950
He didn't mean
to hurt me.

390
00:16:25,035 --> 00:16:27,490
It doesn't matter.
The law is clear.

391
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:28,860
The law is broken!

392
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,470
Ow.

393
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:51,516
So you think
this is the solution?

394
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:53,317
To pretend
that this didn't happen?

395
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:56,524
It's a better solution
than letting you lock him up.

396
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:58,511
Now I'm in pain.

397
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:00,782
So if you're more worried
about being a cop

398
00:17:00,868 --> 00:17:02,860
than being my daughter,

399
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:05,259
maybe you should leave.

400
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,004
You can sit down.
I'm not gonna bite.

401
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,634
I'm good.

402
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,024
Of course.
Suit yourself.

403
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,954
Your partner there
is a real hard-ass, huh?

404
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:22,602
I had a supervisor
just like him at Border Patrol.

405
00:17:22,962 --> 00:17:24,626
He got off
on pushing buttons.

406
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:27,357
He's my training officer,
and we're not discussing this.

407
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:30,931
Hmm. I always forget
that you are a rookie.

408
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:33,188
It must chap your ass

409
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:35,187
to be bossed around
by a younger guy like that.

410
00:17:35,272 --> 00:17:37,373
Not at all. It's the only way
I'm gonna learn.

411
00:17:39,135 --> 00:17:40,660
I'm not buying it.

412
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:42,120
Guy like that?

413
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:45,417
Oh, man. He is all sorts
of superior.

414
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,468
He probably thinks that
I smuggled people over the border

415
00:17:47,553 --> 00:17:48,850
for the money.

416
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:53,667
I watched people die
every day,

417
00:17:53,752 --> 00:17:55,187
trying to
cross that border,

418
00:17:55,272 --> 00:17:57,107
desperate for a new life.

419
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,256
And after
a few years of that...

420
00:17:59,547 --> 00:18:01,022
I couldn't
take it anymore.

421
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:03,813
I decided to do something
and help them.

422
00:18:04,022 --> 00:18:06,417
And so, yeah,
I made some money,

423
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,983
but there are people that
are alive today because of me.

424
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,819
I had no idea you were
such a humanitarian.

425
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:14,623
Thank you.

426
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:17,224
What about the people you
smuggled out of the country...

427
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,695
The, uh, cartel members,
fugitives from justice?

428
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:23,553
Okay, yeah, that was
for the money, but...

429
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:30,467
Hey, you.

430
00:18:30,553 --> 00:18:31,709
What are you wearing?

431
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:34,264
I am at the safe house
right now.

432
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,477
Did you meet my friend Sean?

433
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:37,444
I did.
You dated a Navy SEAL?

434
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,491
I'm gonna kill him.
Yes, I did.

435
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:43,303
It was for about... two months,
right after my divorce.

436
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,533
Was he Team Six?

437
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:46,936
Are you asking if my
ex shot Bin Laden?

438
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,647
Yeah, just in a..."thank you
for your service" kind of way.

439
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:50,876
Got to go.

440
00:18:50,962 --> 00:18:52,242
Yeah, we'll keep it
locked down here.

441
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:54,142
Let us know ASAP.

442
00:18:54,302 --> 00:18:56,357
D.A.'s office just discovered
a credible threat

443
00:18:56,442 --> 00:18:58,412
against our guy...
A cartel hit team.

444
00:18:58,498 --> 00:19:01,803
Trying to figure out if the safe
house has been compromised.

445
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:06,423
Well, that looks
a little awkward.

446
00:19:06,743 --> 00:19:08,092
It sure does.

447
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:09,998
Nurse's station.

448
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:12,943
Gino, hey. I, um,
tried calling your cell.

449
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:14,354
Yeah, I... I know.

450
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,958
I didn't answer.

451
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:18,333
Hello?

452
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:20,044
Gino?

453
00:19:20,252 --> 00:19:21,547
He hung up.

454
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:23,817
Why?
What did you do?

455
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:24,917
Nothing.

456
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:27,566
Um, do you mind if we stop
by the hospital after lunch?

457
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:30,206
Not unless you get
food poisoning.

458
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:32,910
Are they sending backup?
That's unclear.

459
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:35,102
Sounded like they're scrambling
to assess the situation.

460
00:19:35,187 --> 00:19:36,566
Hey, guys.

461
00:19:36,783 --> 00:19:38,686
Something going on?
You seem stressed.

462
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:39,972
Nothing.

463
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:41,817
If there's a problem,
I deserve to know.

464
00:19:41,902 --> 00:19:43,477
It's my life
that's on the line.

465
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:45,027
Sit your ass back down.

466
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:47,640
Make me.

467
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:56,766
Earthquake...
Get on the ground!

468
00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:07,817
Hey!
Everybody under your desks!

469
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:11,187
Everybody down!

470
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:18,817
It's an earthquake!

471
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,882
Get down!

472
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:30,337
Wade!

473
00:20:30,422 --> 00:20:31,462
Wade!

474
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:35,267
Go! Come on!

475
00:20:38,882 --> 00:20:40,131
I got you.

476
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,053
That was
a pretty good one.

477
00:20:48,592 --> 00:20:50,693
I'm gonna check the house, make
sure we're still five by five.

478
00:20:50,778 --> 00:20:51,966
Watch him.

479
00:20:54,542 --> 00:20:55,849
Never been through
an earthquake before.

480
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:58,458
Yeah, they take some
getting used to.

481
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:00,536
Um...

482
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,528
are those guys
supposed to be here?

483
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,091
Get away from there.

484
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:27,853
Don't move!
Get down. Get down.

485
00:21:27,939 --> 00:21:30,030
Give me your hands.
Give me your hands!

486
00:21:30,507 --> 00:21:31,952
- What the hell is going on?
- Ow.

487
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:33,272
Nothing I can't handle.

488
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:34,543
- You alright?
- Yeah.

489
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:35,854
Any word
on the hit squad?

490
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,166
No. Radios are down.
Phone.

491
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:39,753
We're on our own.

492
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:51,376
Okay. Okay.

493
00:21:51,462 --> 00:21:53,165
Let's get you
to this table.

494
00:21:53,906 --> 00:21:55,462
Let's sit you down.

495
00:21:56,195 --> 00:21:58,641
- Good, good.
- Let me take a look.

496
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:00,696
Alright. That's gonna need
a few stitches.

497
00:22:00,782 --> 00:22:02,507
This is not a priority.

498
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,477
Hey, call out
if you're injured!

499
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:06,571
- Me, Sarge.
- Hello? Hello?

500
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:07,985
Land lines are down.

501
00:22:08,071 --> 00:22:10,524
7-Adam-100, status report.

502
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:12,462
Hello? Hel...

503
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,438
- So are the radios.
- Where's the captain?

504
00:22:14,524 --> 00:22:16,157
At a doctor's
appointment.

505
00:22:16,243 --> 00:22:17,587
Or maybe lunch by now.

506
00:22:17,673 --> 00:22:20,743
Everyone!
Everyone! Listen up!

507
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:22,970
We trained for this.

508
00:22:23,087 --> 00:22:25,212
First priority is assessment.

509
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,913
Lennox, Hall... sweep
the station for casualties.

510
00:22:27,999 --> 00:22:30,344
If anyone needs to go home
to check on your family,

511
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,571
you're dismissed.

512
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:33,882
We take care of our own.
Come back when you can.

513
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:35,823
It's alright.
With comms down,

514
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:38,804
we skip right to the old-school
part of the manual.

515
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:41,813
This is a city
with people in crisis.

516
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,003
We will serve them,
we will protect them,

517
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,110
and we will make them safe,
understand?

518
00:22:46,196 --> 00:22:47,244
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

519
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:49,073
Alright.
Let's go! Let's go!

520
00:22:58,754 --> 00:23:00,280
You're gonna need to
hold that to your face.

521
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:01,421
Make sure
you're holding that up.

522
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:04,330
Hey, keep this elevated.
Keep it up. Keep it up.

523
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:12,714
Officers!
Can you help?

524
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,274
Let's get out there.
He needs help.

525
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:18,348
Calm down.
We'll get to you.

526
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:20,436
I'm working as fast
as I can.

527
00:23:20,522 --> 00:23:22,717
Hey!
Hey, ladies and gentlemen!

528
00:23:22,803 --> 00:23:24,398
Ladies
and gentlemen, I need you to form

529
00:23:24,484 --> 00:23:27,404
a single-file line
in order of your arrival.

530
00:23:28,034 --> 00:23:29,779
Now, people! Right now!

531
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:31,342
Single file.
Just line up right here.

532
00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:32,585
Yep.

533
00:23:32,671 --> 00:23:34,850
<i>Listen up, guys.
Settle down.</i>

534
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,537
- Scalp lacerations.
- You can wait.

535
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:45,451
- Stress fracture.
- You can wait.

536
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:47,482
Gino? Gino.

537
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:50,296
Just try to sit up.
Try to sit up.

538
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:52,137
Hey, hey, hey.
Open your eyes.

539
00:23:52,276 --> 00:23:53,791
Hey! Hey!

540
00:23:53,877 --> 00:23:56,639
I need a trauma team!
Possible internal bleeding!

541
00:24:06,061 --> 00:24:08,306
Would it help
if I said I was sorry?

542
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:10,077
I... I think
the earthquake set off

543
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:12,189
my fight-or-flight response.
Save it.

544
00:24:12,274 --> 00:24:14,129
I can't get through to
the DA's office or the station.

545
00:24:14,214 --> 00:24:15,920
Radios are down.
Phone lines are overwhelmed.

546
00:24:16,005 --> 00:24:17,130
Get ready to move.

547
00:24:17,216 --> 00:24:18,612
We can't take a chance
this place has been compromised.

548
00:24:18,697 --> 00:24:21,032
That's dumb. Why would we
run around the city?

549
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,630
There's no cover,
no concealment.

550
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:25,231
I say we stay put from a...
A tactical standpoint.

551
00:24:25,317 --> 00:24:27,290
You don't get a vote.
You hit me in the head.

552
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:32,053
No one else
in the house, right?

553
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,173
If there is, shoot 'em.

554
00:24:55,313 --> 00:24:57,016
- We got to get out of here!
- Back door!

555
00:24:57,126 --> 00:24:58,322
What if there's
a gunman out there, too?

556
00:24:58,407 --> 00:25:00,129
Then you'll shoot him!
We're sitting ducks here.

557
00:25:00,214 --> 00:25:02,008
- Go!
- I'm not going anywhere!

558
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:03,214
- Go.
- No.

559
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,581
- Move!
- Aah.

560
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:41,675
Come on. Come on.
Go. Go. Go. Go.

561
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:43,173
Come on.

562
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,395
- We need transportation.
- Well, in case you haven't noticed,

563
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,225
there's a sniper
between us and our car.

564
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:54,173
Hold here.
Head on a swivel.

565
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:56,485
- This is stupid. We're sitting ducks.
- Shut up.

566
00:25:56,571 --> 00:25:57,876
You are in
way over your head.

567
00:25:57,962 --> 00:26:00,681
Says the guy being hunted
by the cartel hit squad.

568
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:08,818
Nice car.
Inconspicuous.

569
00:26:08,904 --> 00:26:10,084
Get in the back.

570
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,613
What's the plan?
Back to the station?

571
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:14,385
No, that's where these guys
expect us to go.

572
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,045
Safest thing
is to get lost.

573
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:17,835
Go to the last place
they'd think to look for us.

574
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,544
I know just the place.

575
00:26:26,633 --> 00:26:30,528
Yep, this is definitely
the last place I'd look for us.

576
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:35,413
Ugh, ooh.

577
00:26:35,499 --> 00:26:37,006
I hate to be
that guy, but...

578
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:38,646
I'm gonna need
some sunblock.

579
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:40,217
I burn real easy.

580
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:41,921
I don't have any, but I can
bury you up to your neck

581
00:26:42,006 --> 00:26:43,631
in the sand and put
a trash can on your head.

582
00:26:43,716 --> 00:26:45,006
I'm fine.

583
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:56,115
- Ooh, I'm not putting that on.
- The wound is gonna leak.

584
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:58,389
Do you want blood
running into your eye all day?

585
00:26:59,606 --> 00:27:02,201
- That's what I thought.
- Oh, my goodness.

586
00:27:02,506 --> 00:27:03,529
Yep.

587
00:27:05,961 --> 00:27:07,646
- Okay.
- Think we're good?

588
00:27:07,732 --> 00:27:08,709
Wait, wait.
Stay right there.

589
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:09,928
One picture.
Just one.

590
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:11,600
- Stop that.
- One. Just one.

591
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:13,371
Alright, I'm... I'm ready.
Let's go.

592
00:27:13,457 --> 00:27:15,452
Alright.
Radio tower's down.

593
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:18,433
ETA on repair
is at least an hour.

594
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,361
Phone services are swamped.

595
00:27:20,498 --> 00:27:22,459
Only 20% of the calls
are getting through.

596
00:27:22,545 --> 00:27:27,107
So we're going to mark every
Priority One call on the map

597
00:27:27,193 --> 00:27:29,050
so we can all see
where the trouble spots are.

598
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:31,511
Sir, captain called in
on my line with orders for you.

599
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:32,967
Thank you.

600
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,701
Our fearless leader wants me
to immediately dispatch a unit

601
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:45,248
to Bel-Air
to guard against looters.

602
00:27:45,334 --> 00:27:47,685
And he also wants one
sent to his own block.

603
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:50,028
Can you believe this guy?
There's no way I'm doing this.

604
00:27:50,114 --> 00:27:52,849
Oh, yes, you are.
He's the captain.

605
00:27:52,935 --> 00:27:56,864
Disobeying orders like that will
do nothing but get you fired.

606
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:11,040
- Hey.
- Yeah?

607
00:28:11,126 --> 00:28:12,630
Sorry to interrupt.
How's he feeling?

608
00:28:12,716 --> 00:28:14,153
Uh, better.

609
00:28:14,239 --> 00:28:15,920
Thank you for saving him.

610
00:28:16,006 --> 00:28:18,781
Of course.
It's my job.

611
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:20,511
What's gonna happen
to my mom?

612
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:22,739
Is she going to jail?

613
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,349
That's not my call.

614
00:28:25,482 --> 00:28:27,957
She's facing
serious charges,

615
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:31,674
but her state of mind will be
taken into consideration.

616
00:28:31,846 --> 00:28:34,401
And if you can advocate
on her behalf,

617
00:28:34,486 --> 00:28:35,841
there's a chance
she could avoid prison

618
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:37,661
and get the treatment
she needs.

619
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,317
Thank you.

620
00:28:43,696 --> 00:28:47,458
<i>Control, 7-Adam-7,
show us on patrol in Bel-Air.</i>

621
00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:48,769
Still no word from Gino?

622
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:52,670
Nothing.
What if he's hurt? Or worse.

623
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:54,591
And the last thing
I said to him was in anger.

624
00:28:54,676 --> 00:28:56,071
Odds are he's fine.

625
00:28:56,156 --> 00:28:58,880
Quake wasn't that big,
and the hospital's retrofitted.

626
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:01,380
This is a waste
of time and resources.

627
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:03,662
The last thing people are gonna
do when the city's at a standstill

628
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:05,786
is drive up to Bel-Air
and loot.

629
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:08,825
Or maybe not.

630
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:24,200
Front door's open.

631
00:29:28,327 --> 00:29:29,722
- Stay back!
- Gun!

632
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:33,361
Come on!

633
00:29:33,446 --> 00:29:36,111
Come on!

634
00:29:36,312 --> 00:29:38,207
I'll kill you!

635
00:29:41,016 --> 00:29:42,355
He retreated inside!

636
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:43,597
Let's go!

637
00:29:47,298 --> 00:29:48,772
Stay focused.

638
00:29:56,468 --> 00:29:59,290
Remember your training.
Keep it cool. Keep it tight.

639
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:16,803
- Hands up!
- Don't shoot!

640
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:18,868
- Come out of there!
- Weapon! Drop the gun!

641
00:30:18,977 --> 00:30:20,653
- It's only a BB gun.
- What the hell happened to you?

642
00:30:20,738 --> 00:30:22,343
My boss,
he's lost his mind.

643
00:30:22,428 --> 00:30:23,753
Who?
The fat guy in a kimono?

644
00:30:23,838 --> 00:30:25,423
Yeah. Tommy Lamont.
I'm his assistant.

645
00:30:25,508 --> 00:30:27,564
He was on day three of a coke
binge when the earthquake hit,

646
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:29,267
and now he thinks
it's the end of the world.

647
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:31,157
I'm still lost
on the welts.

648
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:33,025
He had us hunting each other
throughout the house

649
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,813
with BB guns to stay sharp
for the oncoming apocalypse.

650
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:37,454
- You're kidding.
- I wish.

651
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:40,290
But then when it hit,
he got into the gun cabinet,

652
00:30:40,376 --> 00:30:42,931
and I was terrified he would
forget which was which.

653
00:30:43,017 --> 00:30:44,376
Can you turn off
that alarm?

654
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:45,485
Yes.

655
00:30:45,571 --> 00:30:47,163
Go do that,
then wait outside.

656
00:30:52,446 --> 00:30:54,035
On me.

657
00:31:04,178 --> 00:31:05,977
Jonah!

658
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:09,757
Jonah!

659
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:21,496
Mr. Lamont, LAPD!

660
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,316
Mr. Lamont,

661
00:31:23,402 --> 00:31:25,207
I need you to stand
where I can see you

662
00:31:25,293 --> 00:31:26,868
and put your weapons
on the ground.

663
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:28,349
I'm not falling
for that.

664
00:31:28,548 --> 00:31:30,753
I saw that episode
of "Midnight Apocalypse"

665
00:31:30,838 --> 00:31:32,593
where they steal
the police uniforms.

666
00:31:32,678 --> 00:31:33,843
This guy is
out of his mind.

667
00:31:33,928 --> 00:31:35,323
Sir, you're not
thinking straight.

668
00:31:35,408 --> 00:31:37,482
- We're here to help you.
- I don't believe you!

669
00:31:38,794 --> 00:31:39,980
It was just a BB.

670
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:43,171
That alarm is eating
into my brain!

671
00:31:43,257 --> 00:31:45,132
Jonah's taking care
of that.

672
00:31:45,218 --> 00:31:46,273
What have you done
with Jonah?

673
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:48,402
He's fine!
Jonah is fine.

674
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:50,653
He's helping us.
Gonna take care of that alarm.

675
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,894
Ah, you tricked him.

676
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,652
He's helping you
steal my rations!

677
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:55,963
Jonah!

678
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:57,753
Don't listen to them!

679
00:31:57,838 --> 00:31:59,133
Don't trust them!

680
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:01,233
We're gonna be here
all day.

681
00:32:03,147 --> 00:32:04,662
Mr. Lamont,
I'm gonna confide in you,

682
00:32:04,818 --> 00:32:06,803
but you
can't tell anyone.

683
00:32:06,888 --> 00:32:08,488
We have a place
all set up.

684
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:11,941
A bunch of us survivors
are heading that way.

685
00:32:12,205 --> 00:32:14,730
Rations that can last for years,
solar power,

686
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,574
but we need you to trust us
and set down your weapons.

687
00:32:27,468 --> 00:32:30,533
Turn around, and put your hands
on the back of your head.

688
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:33,023
Get on your knees.

689
00:32:46,468 --> 00:32:48,337
Are you okay? Yeah.

690
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,036
On the bright side,
we finally have a legit reason

691
00:32:50,121 --> 00:32:51,536
to go to
the hospital now.

692
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,355
Jonah!
Call my lawyer.

693
00:33:00,443 --> 00:33:01,506
It would be a lot nicer

694
00:33:01,592 --> 00:33:02,939
- without these cuffs.
- Tough.

695
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:05,235
Texts are back online.
It's from the ADA.

696
00:33:05,321 --> 00:33:06,783
The hit team
wasn't trying to kill Hayes...

697
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:08,368
It was trying
to rescue him.

698
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:09,982
You were in on it
the whole time?

699
00:33:10,068 --> 00:33:11,204
You set us up
to be killed.

700
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,509
No.

701
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,125
Well, yeah.

702
00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:15,733
As much as I love the idea

703
00:33:15,818 --> 00:33:18,517
of being a barista
in Armpit, Arizona,

704
00:33:18,603 --> 00:33:21,017
- I've got other plans.
- How did they know how to find you?

705
00:33:21,103 --> 00:33:23,767
You were sequestered.
No phone, no Internet.

706
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,267
GPS tracker.
Son of a bitch.

707
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:28,612
- That's not mine.
- We got to get out of here.

708
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,493
Uh-oh.

709
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:47,647
What do we do now?

710
00:33:47,733 --> 00:33:49,193
You guys should just
let me walk away.

711
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,388
I mean, nobody gets hurt.

712
00:33:51,482 --> 00:33:53,017
Think how
you're gonna feel

713
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:55,233
if another buddy gets killed
in the line of duty.

714
00:33:55,318 --> 00:33:56,963
Shut up.

715
00:33:57,048 --> 00:33:58,383
So what now?

716
00:33:58,468 --> 00:33:59,963
They can't afford
to kill Hayes,

717
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:01,323
so they'll have to
come up here and get him.

718
00:34:01,408 --> 00:34:03,403
You do know
there's three of them, right?

719
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:05,193
It's almost
a fair fight.

720
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:06,822
Hook him up.

721
00:34:33,288 --> 00:34:34,460
Drop your guns
in the sand!

722
00:34:34,546 --> 00:34:36,231
- Get down on your stomachs now!
- No.

723
00:34:36,353 --> 00:34:38,758
Get down now!

724
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:43,296
Hands behind your back.

725
00:34:46,063 --> 00:34:49,366
So I'm guessing my
immunity deal's out the window.

726
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,585
Cafeteria
had snickerdoodles.

727
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,833
Can't eat
before the surgery.

728
00:35:07,185 --> 00:35:11,030
Well, you can
have them after.

729
00:35:18,508 --> 00:35:20,749
I know you're
disappointed in me...

730
00:35:22,384 --> 00:35:24,624
...but you and Mom always
taught me to be true to myself.

731
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:29,186
And... this job
it's...

732
00:35:29,624 --> 00:35:31,741
It's who I am.

733
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:34,132
It makes me happy.

734
00:35:36,357 --> 00:35:38,952
You hate the system because
it's designed to punish people,

735
00:35:39,038 --> 00:35:40,092
not care for them,

736
00:35:40,178 --> 00:35:41,561
but that will never change

737
00:35:41,647 --> 00:35:44,811
unless people like me
step up and make it change.

738
00:35:49,586 --> 00:35:53,038
I heard you talking
to that patient down the hall.

739
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:57,577
You were honest with him...
and kind.

740
00:35:58,745 --> 00:36:00,374
I was impressed.

741
00:36:02,708 --> 00:36:03,913
Dr. Chen?

742
00:36:04,013 --> 00:36:06,390
William.
I told you not to come.

743
00:36:06,771 --> 00:36:08,374
Dad, who's this?

744
00:36:08,477 --> 00:36:09,872
A friend.

745
00:36:09,973 --> 00:36:12,171
- You should go.
- I'm so sorry.

746
00:36:12,669 --> 00:36:14,452
I was...

747
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:18,429
William, did you
assault my father?

748
00:36:18,684 --> 00:36:21,449
It was an accident.
I... I... I didn't...

749
00:36:21,534 --> 00:36:22,726
No, Lucy.

750
00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:24,179
Don't.

751
00:36:24,428 --> 00:36:26,999
N...
It'll devastate him!

752
00:36:27,327 --> 00:36:28,944
Destroy all the work
we've done.

753
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,702
- I'm sorry.
- Let him go.

754
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,183
I can't.
I don't have a choice.

755
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:38,413
I will be right here
when you get out of surgery, okay?

756
00:36:38,499 --> 00:36:40,007
Don't bother.

757
00:36:46,215 --> 00:36:47,980
<i>♪ I can't hear you ♪</i>

758
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:50,874
- Sorry, sorry.
- No, no. Don't be.

759
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,443
- <i>♪ You're too far away ♪
- I deserve to be in a little pain</i>

760
00:36:53,528 --> 00:36:55,640
after overreacting
this morning.

761
00:36:56,944 --> 00:37:01,124
Just... my dad is a legend
in the LAPD.

762
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:04,351
Half the people there think
I just got in on his name.

763
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:07,819
Anything I do hits me twice
as hard as any other rookie.

764
00:37:08,076 --> 00:37:11,461
So I, um, just
try to keep my head down

765
00:37:11,547 --> 00:37:14,061
and make everything
about the work.

766
00:37:14,983 --> 00:37:17,351
- <i>♪ I can't love you ♪</i>
- I'm sorry.

767
00:37:17,445 --> 00:37:19,749
- <i>♪ How you want me to ♪</i>
- It's not easy.

768
00:37:19,835 --> 00:37:24,288
No, what's not easy
is admitting how freaked I was

769
00:37:24,374 --> 00:37:27,327
when I couldn't get ahold
of you after the earthquake.

770
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:32,694
I'm sorry for being
such an idiot earlier.

771
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,516
Do over?

772
00:37:38,451 --> 00:37:40,015
Do over.

773
00:37:43,532 --> 00:37:45,577
- So I guess it's our bad.
- Your "bad"?

774
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:47,391
Your guys were supposed to
give Hayes a thorough pat-down

775
00:37:47,476 --> 00:37:48,594
before bringing him
to the safe house.

776
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:49,734
How the hell did they
miss a tracking device?

777
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:51,693
Well, they didn't.
The deputy who patted him down

778
00:37:51,778 --> 00:37:53,570
confessed to slipping Hayes
the tracking chip.

779
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:55,090
He's in custody now,
too.

780
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:56,359
So what's gonna happen
to Hayes?

781
00:37:56,444 --> 00:37:58,546
Well, he's facing
a half a dozen new charges,

782
00:37:58,632 --> 00:38:00,164
including two counts
of attempted murder.

783
00:38:00,249 --> 00:38:01,655
He'll do 20 years,
easy.

784
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:03,632
That's if
he still cooperates.

785
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,515
Officer Chen.
Booking report is only three pages.

786
00:38:08,601 --> 00:38:12,096
- Why do you have five?
- Um... I thought this arrest warranted

787
00:38:12,182 --> 00:38:14,069
a mental health
report addendum.

788
00:38:14,476 --> 00:38:16,302
The perpetrator shattered
your father's arm.

789
00:38:16,388 --> 00:38:17,653
Are you sure you're not
trying to get back

790
00:38:17,738 --> 00:38:18,991
into your dad's
good graces?

791
00:38:19,077 --> 00:38:21,242
I'm pretty sure
that's impossible,

792
00:38:21,328 --> 00:38:23,132
but, um, he's not wrong.

793
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,823
This guy needs help,
not prison,

794
00:38:24,908 --> 00:38:28,483
so I'm gonna do what I can
to help get that for him.

795
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:30,390
Good.

796
00:38:31,038 --> 00:38:32,327
Wait.

797
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,351
Was that a test?

798
00:38:36,263 --> 00:38:38,898
What, you think Bradford has
a monopoly on 'em?

799
00:38:43,428 --> 00:38:44,913
Thanks for the assist today.

800
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:46,164
Oh, are you
kidding me?

801
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,827
- That was fun being back in crisis mode.
- Sergeant Grey!

802
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:51,998
Yes, sir?

803
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:53,794
I just got off the phone
with my wife.

804
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:56,140
The patrol that you
assigned to my neighbor...

805
00:38:56,371 --> 00:38:57,772
never showed up.

806
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,319
That's my fault, sir.

807
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:04,060
I rerouted the officers
to assist a traffic collision.

808
00:39:04,256 --> 00:39:05,651
If you want to
file a complaint,

809
00:39:05,737 --> 00:39:07,640
you'd be well within
your rights to do so.

810
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:11,171
I would... if I were
remaining in command here.

811
00:39:11,772 --> 00:39:13,686
I've just been promoted
to headquarters.

812
00:39:13,783 --> 00:39:15,663
Good luck with
your next captain.

813
00:39:16,264 --> 00:39:18,585
Oh, good luck
to you, sir.

814
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,905
How the hell
did that guy get promoted?

815
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:25,530
Made a few phone calls.

816
00:39:25,623 --> 00:39:27,538
Sang his praises
downtown.

817
00:39:27,638 --> 00:39:31,116
I told them how he
single-handedly saved the city.

818
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:33,258
Doesn't it bother you
that he's going to take credit

819
00:39:33,343 --> 00:39:35,186
for everything
that you did today?

820
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:42,866
No.
The people who matter know.

821
00:39:43,401 --> 00:39:46,335
<i>♪ How you want me to ♪</i>

822
00:39:48,171 --> 00:39:50,436
So how'd you like
your first earthquake?

823
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:52,577
It was terrifying.

824
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:54,452
Well, just wait

825
00:39:54,538 --> 00:39:56,358
- until the big one hits.
- Oh.

826
00:39:57,555 --> 00:39:59,491
Sean texted me
about you.

827
00:40:00,427 --> 00:40:03,007
It looks like
you made a fan.

828
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,205
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

829
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,327
And I wouldn't have

830
00:40:06,413 --> 00:40:08,086
had you not told me
about that opportunity,

831
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:09,897
- so thank you very much.
- Mm.

832
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:13,362
I'm sorry that you...
almost got killed.

833
00:40:13,448 --> 00:40:15,017
- I know, right?
- Oh.

834
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,947
Is... everything okay?

835
00:40:24,033 --> 00:40:25,468
Y-Yeah.

836
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:28,777
Was there a reason
you didn't tell Sean

837
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:30,152
about me being a rookie?

838
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:33,113
I didn't know
that I was supposed to.

839
00:40:33,238 --> 00:40:34,733
It bothers you?

840
00:40:34,818 --> 00:40:37,129
No, no.
It's just...

841
00:40:37,949 --> 00:40:39,809
You're a very
impressive woman.

842
00:40:39,959 --> 00:40:41,746
Very. It's...

843
00:40:42,082 --> 00:40:44,488
the least impressive thing
about you

844
00:40:44,574 --> 00:40:47,777
is you're
dating a 45-year-old rookie.

845
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:51,777
That's ridiculous.

846
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:54,254
Look, I...

847
00:40:54,928 --> 00:40:56,574
I like you.

848
00:40:57,279 --> 00:40:59,176
You like me.

849
00:40:59,985 --> 00:41:02,137
You're not always
gonna be a rookie,

850
00:41:02,223 --> 00:41:07,543
and I will always be
this amazing, so...

851
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:10,457
Why?
What's wrong with that?

852
00:41:16,904 --> 00:41:18,371
Nothing.
