I thought you got an offer
to play for the WNBA.

296

year, lost my scholarship.

299
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:19,668
You know, I met you
once at a party at USC.

300

You were so passionate
about playing ball,

301
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,712
and I was so not about
majoring in engineering.

302
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,346
Got me thinking about
going a different way,

303
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,673

doing something else?

Sure. But things don't
always go your way.

309

One out of three rookies washes out,

311

312
