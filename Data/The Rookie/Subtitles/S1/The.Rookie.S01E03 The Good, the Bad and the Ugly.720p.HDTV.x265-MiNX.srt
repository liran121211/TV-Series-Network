You think they'd get mad
if we called in sick, week one?

<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

3
00:00:05,387 --> 00:00:07,494
It's time to play the
Training Officer match game.

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,678
Officer Bradford, you get Lucy Chen.

5
00:00:09,712 --> 00:00:12,180
Officer Lopez, Jackson West.

6
00:00:12,215 --> 00:00:14,683
Officer Bishop, you get John Nolan...

7
00:00:14,717 --> 00:00:16,157
...the 40-year-old rookie.

8
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:17,886
I've been trying to find you.

9
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:19,360
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

10
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,518
That was my wife.

11
00:00:20,543 --> 00:00:22,190
I haven't seen her in almost a year.

12
00:00:22,277 --> 00:00:24,327
Show me those hands. Now!

13
00:00:26,148 --> 00:00:27,281
You're a pain in my ass.

14
00:00:27,316 --> 00:00:28,416
That's my job.

15
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,984
Get out your gun and cover me!

16
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:33,323
Officer West,
you didn't fire a single shot.

17
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:34,414
It won't happen again.

18
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:35,606
Not good enough.

19

two members of a heist crew

20

Whoa.

Oh!

Yeah, sure it is. Just not to you.

35
00:01:57,777 --> 00:02:00,226
Honestly, who steals stolen
money right in front of a cop?

36
00:02:00,293 --> 00:02:02,747
Somebody stupid or desperate.

37
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:04,869
- I thought we were here to run.
- Oh, yes, we are.

38
00:02:04,894 --> 00:02:06,358
We just need a little
more warm-up than you do.

39
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:07,674
- You look great, though.
- Yeah.

40
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,270
- Okay, you think you're cute...
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,361
...but the job's a marathon.

42
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:12,291
And I'm not gonna be the one
who falls by the wayside

43
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,643
because I didn't train.

44
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:15,009
Looking good! You're a beast!

45
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:17,239
We're right behind you!

46
00:02:21,802 --> 00:02:23,102
He's right, though.

47
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:24,407
Tim gets back today, and I feel like

48
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:27,106
I should have prepared myself
somehow for the abuse to come.

49
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:28,360
You saved the guy's life.

50
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:30,062
He's got to cut you some slack.

51
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:31,978
Does Talia ever cut you slack

52
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:33,946
or Sergeant Grey?

53
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,629
- It's been good knowing you.
- Uh-huh.

54
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,917
It's time to run, Officer Nolan.

55
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,130
- Let's go.
- Oh!

56
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:41,425
Be right there. I'm just
gonna stretch a little more.

57
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,766
So, how you feeling?

58
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:48,987
Good.

59
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:50,487
Everything okay with my green slip?

60
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:53,876
Yeah. Yeah, you're medically
cleared to return to duty.

61
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:57,470
Which means it's time for the
"so you got shot" speech.

62
00:02:57,783 --> 00:03:00,473
I only give it to officers
wounded on the job.

63
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:02,044
Lucky me.

64
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:03,335
Yeah, lucky you.

65
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:05,178
So, you came in this morning

66
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:07,580
thinking everything goes
back to normal now,

67
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,349
you can just flip a switch,

68
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:14,153
and the trauma you
suffered will go away.

69
00:03:14,434 --> 00:03:15,513
It won't.

70
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,256
But you're trying to
muscle your way through.

71
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:18,970
That's what I did.

72
00:03:19,072 --> 00:03:21,106
Trust me, it didn't go well.

73
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,930
I didn't know you got shot.

74
00:03:23,964 --> 00:03:26,098
My last year on patrol.

75
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:28,101
Spent two weeks in the ICU.

76
00:03:28,414 --> 00:03:31,603
Rushed back thinking I could
put it all behind me,

77
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:33,432
but it doesn't work that way.

78
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:36,509
I understand.

79
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:39,011
I promise I'll... I'll take it slow.

80
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,846
Okay.

81
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:03,569
All right, all right, all right.

82
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,538
Settle down. Settle down.

83
00:04:05,572 --> 00:04:07,473
Let's get to it.

84
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,242
You ready, Officer Nolan?

85
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:11,377
'Cause once again, we start with you.

86
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:12,604
I'm flattered?

87
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:14,034
Don't be.

88
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:18,413
Yesterday, a four-man
crew disguised as zombies

89
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:22,648
knocked over a cash advance
near Pico and Robertson.

90
00:04:22,723 --> 00:04:24,874
So, Officers Bishop and Nolan
were able to apprehend

91
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,227
two of the criminals, while
the other two escaped.

92
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,487
Somehow, Officer Nolan managed to let

93
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:32,999
a civilian steal 10 grand
in already stolen cash.

94
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:35,794
Luckily, CCTV captured our thief.

95
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:37,409
Still waiting on an I.D.

96
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,238
Uh, he plays guitar, if that helps.

97
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,473
Absolutely.

98
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:43,576
'Cause they always list special
talents on your rap sheet.

99
00:04:46,813 --> 00:04:48,581
Captain. How can we help you?

100
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,050
First off, I wanted to
welcome Tim Bradford back.

101
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:52,478
If you need anything, you let me know.

102
00:04:52,503 --> 00:04:53,558
Yes, ma'am.

103
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,528
Secondly, we just got some
new intel on our zombies.

104
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:57,967
Turns out that they're responsible

105
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:00,059
for a rash of armed robberies
in the last six months,

106
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:01,594
always disguised differently.

107
00:05:01,657 --> 00:05:03,375
Detectives
want to get the two in custody

108
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,792
to flip on their partners at large,

109
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:08,429
but there is no guarantee,
so don't stop hunting.

110
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:11,652
Finally, we got a request
for a civil standby.

111
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:14,140
Turns out somebody's getting
fired from a tech job.

112
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:16,469
Supervisor's
worried things may not go right.

113
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:18,944
Babysitting a termination...

114
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:22,448
a patrol officer's favorite assignment.

115
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,542
So, who shall I bless with it?

116
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:29,541
Officer Nolan, are you volunteering?

117
00:05:29,598 --> 00:05:31,457
Just embracing the inevitable, sir.

118
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,861
Smart man.

119
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:34,527
Get the address from dispatch.

120
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,975
That's it.

121
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:41,427
You sure you don't want me to drive?

122
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:43,769
Why would I want that, Boot?

123
00:05:43,869 --> 00:05:45,316
You think I'd go back on duty

124
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:47,348
- before I'm 100 percent?
- No, sir.

125
00:05:47,376 --> 00:05:49,475
Or do you think simply doing
your job during a firefight

126
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:51,344
- means you get special treatment?
- No, sir.

127
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:53,779
You'll drive when you've earned it.

128
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,227
Yes, sir.

129
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:00,092
It's good to have you back.

130
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:01,898
Damn straight.

131
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,068
How could you possibly know
he was gonna take the money?

132
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,575
Because everyone's an opportunist.

133
00:06:05,622 --> 00:06:07,026
A guy who plays the guitar for change...

134
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,699
he sees a bag of money,
he's gonna steal it

135
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:09,995
10 times out of 10.

136
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,507
See, your problem is that
you think that people

137
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:14,198
are inherently good, but you're wrong.

138
00:06:14,293 --> 00:06:15,752
People are good when it's easy.

139
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:18,604
When push comes to shove,
everyone crosses the line.

140
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:19,952
Wow.

141
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:22,006
I must have missed that chapter
in Gandhi's biography.

142
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,165
Yeah, well, until Gandhi
shows up on Western Avenue,

143
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:26,621
assume that everyone you
meet is one bad day away

144
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:27,712
from committing a crime.

145
00:06:27,795 --> 00:06:29,348
Understood.

146
00:06:29,428 --> 00:06:31,758
But, you know, Gandhi is dead.

147
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:38,182
- Good morning.
- Morning.

148
00:06:38,477 --> 00:06:39,711
Doing some renovating?

149
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:42,044
I just took my kitchen
down to the studs.

150
00:06:42,144 --> 00:06:43,355
Big job.

151
00:06:43,397 --> 00:06:44,981
What did your contractor estimate...
two months?

152
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,298
Uh, four.

153
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,566
He's lying.

154
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,535
Longest it ever took me was three,

155
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,570
and that was because the
appliances were on back order.

156
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,739
You tell him he doesn't
beat his estimate,

157
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:55,641
he's gonna get a call from the LAPD.

158
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:57,430
I will.

159
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,545
- Thank you.
- You bet.

160
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:05,537
Officers. I thought you'd
be here 20 minutes ago.

161
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,053
And Nancy's with you.
We'll make this quick.

162
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:10,756
Wait. What's going on?

163
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:13,779
I think you're getting fired.

164
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,365
Oh, thank God you guys are here.

165
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:20,897
He's trapped in there.

166
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:22,332
In where? The bank?

167
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:23,588
No. In the wall.

168
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:26,739
Mike went inside to fix an ATM
last night before we closed,

169
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,842
and we forgot he was in there and left.

170
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:32,178
The lock must have broke when
he tried to come back out,

171
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:34,493
and he's been inside all night.

172
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:36,245
Pushed this
note through the receipt slot

173
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:37,736
when he heard us come in.

174
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:45,665
Control, 7-Adam-19 requesting LAFD

175
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:50,106
to 3301 Ditmer. for a
guy trapped in a wall.

176
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:53,275
Sir, we're gonna get you out of there.

177
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:56,402
Sir, can you hear me?

178
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:03,442
What's that supposed to mean?

179
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:05,261
Hypoxia. Go grab the
halligan out of the trunk.

180
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,735
We can't wait for the fire department.

181
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:09,243
Sir, I need you to get low
so I can open this wall up.

182
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:10,666
How tall is the space behind the ATM?

183
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:12,677
Oh, I don't know. It's
pretty cramped in there.

184
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:14,413
About five feet.

185
00:08:27,295 --> 00:08:28,887
Why am I doing this?

186
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:30,722
Boot, get in there.

187
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,816
Sir, are you all right?

188
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:54,660
Just to be clear, Mrs. Wu,
you are not under arrest.

189
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:56,574
But your former employer has indicated

190
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:58,294
that you are no longer
welcome back on premise.

191
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,895
Why the hell would I
want to come back here?

192
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:01,426
Look, I've been where you are.

193
00:09:01,495 --> 00:09:03,662
I know how this feels. It's horrible.

194
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:05,180
But it can actually be an opportunity...

195
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:06,607
All right, save the friendly act

196
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:08,779
for the next person you strong-arm.

197
00:09:11,244 --> 00:09:13,712
You do know that you're a
cop, not a moving company.

198
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:16,234
We were going the same way. I
had an extra pair of hands.

199
00:09:16,349 --> 00:09:17,854
Exactly... hands you would have needed

200
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,114
if the situation went south.

201
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,742
There's a reason her
boss wanted us here.

202
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:22,143
Yeah, but I'm not seeing it.

203
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,795
There's no harm in just giving someone

204
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:25,217
the benefit of the doubt.

205
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:29,295
How does that feel, Chad?!

206
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:30,986
Stupid idiot!

207
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:32,982
Or...

208
00:09:33,062 --> 00:09:34,150
Hey! Ma'am!

209
00:09:34,175 --> 00:09:35,365
- Ms. Wu! Ms. Wu!
- Stupid...

210
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:38,404
<i>7-Adam-07, silent
alarm tripped at Chili John's.</i>

211
00:09:41,608 --> 00:09:43,347
You think it's actually
a crime in progress?

212
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,813
9 times out of 10, a silent
alarm is tripped accidentally,

213
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,670
but you always treat it like it's real.

214
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:50,215
Put the money in the damn bag!

215
00:09:50,307 --> 00:09:51,584
Put the money in the damn bag!

216
00:09:51,706 --> 00:09:53,689
Are you crazy?! Hurry up! Hurry up!

217
00:09:53,714 --> 00:09:54,784
- Put the money in the damn bag!
- 7-Adam-7,

218
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:55,965
we have a 2-11 in
progress at our location.

219
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:57,044
Requesting backup.

220
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:58,152
- Do we go in?
- Put it in the bag!

221
00:09:58,176 --> 00:09:59,354
No. That'll just escalate things.

222
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:01,946
- Come on!
- We'll grab her on the way out.

223
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,735
Police! Drop your weapon!

224
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:05,930
Stop! Stop!

225
00:10:05,995 --> 00:10:07,644
It's plastic.

226
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,033
Stop!

227
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:14,785
Aah!

228
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:21,105
Sue Cliffords?

229
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,664
- Do I know you?
- You know her?

230
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:24,235
She played ball for the Trojans.

231
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:26,445
Best 3-point shooter in the NCAA.

232
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,692
Nice to meet a fan.

233
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:29,935
Let me guess. You're
waiting for the perfect moment

234
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,033
to say "I told you so."

235
00:10:31,058 --> 00:10:33,530
I get no pleasure in being
right, Officer Nolan.

236
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,902
Okay. I get a little.

237
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,070
But were you right? I mean, just because

238
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:40,190
she snapped in the moment,

239
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:41,490
that doesn't make her a bad person.

240
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,649
The "why" doesn't matter.

241
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,710
Our job is not to
weigh a citizen's morality.

242
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:46,987
It's to enforce the law.

243
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:49,113
And when push came to
shove, she broke it.

244
00:10:49,394 --> 00:10:51,193
<i>7-Adam-15, we have an I.D.</i>

245
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,715
<i>on your guitar-playing train thief.</i>

246
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,674
<i>Suspect identified as Roman Ealy.</i>

247
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:56,425
<i>617 South Cleaver Avenue.</i>

248
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,018
7-Adam-15. Reattach us to 2-11.

249
00:11:00,045 --> 00:11:01,395
Show us en route.

250
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,895
Wow. 20 points a game, huh?

251
00:11:04,226 --> 00:11:05,921
You were no joke.

252
00:11:06,038 --> 00:11:07,382
So, what happened?

253
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,841
I thought you got an offer
to play for the WNBA.

254
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,737
Blew out my knee senior
year, lost my scholarship.

255
00:11:12,771 --> 00:11:14,593
And now you commit armed robbery?

256
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:16,636
What else am I qualified to do?

257
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:19,668
You know, I met you
once at a party at USC.

258
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,385
You were so passionate
about playing ball,

259
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,712
and I was so not about
majoring in engineering.

260
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,346
Got me thinking about
going a different way,

261
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,673
and, well, here I am.

262
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,239
How nice for you.

263
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,331
You ever think about
doing something else?

264
00:11:32,451 --> 00:11:33,651
Hell, no.

265
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:35,784
Being a cop is the only
thing I ever wanted.

266
00:11:35,881 --> 00:11:37,681
Sure. But things don't
always go your way.

267
00:11:37,756 --> 00:11:39,812
You got to have a Plan "B" just in case.

268
00:11:39,885 --> 00:11:41,552
One out of three rookies washes out,

269
00:11:41,607 --> 00:11:43,322
so odds are either you, Chen, or Nolan

270
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,128
won't be here in a year.

271
00:11:45,217 --> 00:11:47,372
I thought you were a sure
bet to succeed at first,

272
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:49,804
but those other two are rocking it,

273
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:51,095
and you stumbled out the gate.

274
00:11:52,918 --> 00:11:54,830
That was a one-time thing.

275
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,314
I have a long career ahead of me.

276
00:11:56,339 --> 00:11:58,071
Yeah, that's what I thought.

277
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:01,807
7-Adam-15, Code 6 on our train thief.

278
00:12:03,943 --> 00:12:05,326
LAPD! Open up!

279
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,014
Sir, I can see you in there!

280
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,583
Do not make me break this door down!

281
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:12,809
Yeah. I-I'm sorry.

282
00:12:13,158 --> 00:12:14,625
I'm so sorry.

283
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:16,295
Now, put your hands
where I can see them.

284
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,015
Hands behind your head.
Interlock your fingers.

285
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:23,294
Sir, where is the money?

286
00:12:23,385 --> 00:12:25,254
I swear I was gonna return it.

287
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:27,372
It... I... It, um...

288
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:35,113
Did you spend any of it?

289
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,430
I-I-I bought some groceries,

290
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:41,257
and I had the water turned back on.

291
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,528
I-I'm sorry. I-I'll pay it back.

292
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:47,095
I just... It's been so hard.

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,801
My wife died last year...

294
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:51,166
Sir, put your hands behind your back.

295
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,246
No, pl... please.

296
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:54,038
I-I've never even gotten
a parking ticket before.

297
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:56,676
- Can't I do something? I'll...
- Daddy?

298
00:12:56,815 --> 00:12:58,582
Jacob, go back to your room, buddy.

299
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,582
It's okay. He can come out.

300
00:13:01,707 --> 00:13:03,543
Okay, come here.

301
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:06,147
Well, what's gonna happen to him?

302
00:13:06,432 --> 00:13:08,216
Child Protective Services will take him.

303
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:09,596
If you have any family in the area,

304
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,138
then they can pick him up later.

305
00:13:11,237 --> 00:13:13,535
Uh, yeah, my... my wife's sister,

306
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,893
she lives in Chatsworth.

307
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:18,410
We'll take her info, make
sure CPS gets in touch.

308
00:13:18,824 --> 00:13:21,793
But for now you're gonna
need to come with me.

309
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:25,299
Best I can do is make sure your
son doesn't see you in cuffs.

310
00:13:25,611 --> 00:13:27,011
- Please...
- I'm sorry,

311
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:28,646
but you need to say goodbye.

312
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:31,783
Okay. All right.

313
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:33,970
Hey, hey, bud,

314
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,945
I got to leave for a little bit, okay?

315
00:13:37,096 --> 00:13:39,131
You're gonna stay with Aunt Judy.

316
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:41,141
I'm gonna see you real soon, okay?

317
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:42,713
I promise.

318
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:44,893
I love you.

319
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,522
Sir, you need to come with me now.

320
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:02,295
- Daddy!
- Oh, okay.

321
00:14:02,334 --> 00:14:03,613
- Daddy!
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

322
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:05,144
- Daddy!
- No, no, it's o... it's okay.

323
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:06,712
It's gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

324
00:14:06,736 --> 00:14:08,064
Daddy!

325
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:10,456
- Daddy!
- What did I do? I've ruined everything.

326
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,459
Daddy!

327
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,983
You okay?

328
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,313
Of course.

329
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:25,853
Does that ever get any easier...

330
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:27,779
taking a parent away from their kid?

331
00:14:28,024 --> 00:14:29,341
No.

332
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,054
But feeling bad for the guy
doesn't change what he did.

333
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:35,003
Still, poor kid.

334
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:41,850
Call your insurance
company about your property.

335
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:44,092
We'll file the report, but the fact is,

336
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,276
most cold burglaries stay cold.

337
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,051
You think of anything else,
my number's right there.

338
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:52,939
Hey, I'm just gonna hit the restroom.

339
00:14:53,312 --> 00:14:54,523
Make it fast, Boot.

340
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:18,280
No, no, no, no!

341
00:15:22,925 --> 00:15:24,759
Hey, did anyone run out here?

342
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:26,431
What?

343
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:29,064
Someone took my belt and gun.

344
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:31,270
I hung it on the hook, and I
secured the bathroom beforehand.

345
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,417
There was no one else in there.

346
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:34,589
Did the walls of the stall
reach top to bottom?

347
00:15:35,545 --> 00:15:38,132
- No, sir.
- Then it wasn't secure, was it, Boot?

348
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:40,014
Now your weapon is on the street

349
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,319
because you couldn't hold your water.

350
00:15:45,135 --> 00:15:46,609
Bradford.

351
00:15:49,412 --> 00:15:50,612
When?

352
00:15:52,455 --> 00:15:54,189
I-I'll be right there.

353
00:15:54,284 --> 00:15:55,351
Get in.

354
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:56,678
What about my belt?

355
00:15:58,695 --> 00:15:59,983
Get in.

356
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,911
What... What's happening?
Where are we going?

357
00:16:04,994 --> 00:16:06,862
Emergency room.

358
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:14,790
Oh, that was awesome! Dude, do it again!

359
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:17,245
Whoo!

360
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,705
These fools are the last thing
I want to deal with right now.

361
00:16:22,852 --> 00:16:24,783
You want to tell me what
the hell is going on?

362
00:16:24,921 --> 00:16:27,091
We're filming stunts for
our YouTube channel.

363
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:29,991
Logan's brother did
it and made hella cash.

364
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,260
That's not illegal, right?

365
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:33,949
Making hella cash? No.
But reckless driving is.

366
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:35,891
<i>- Yo!
- How the hell...</i>

367
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:38,710
<i>Yo, this is Officer PootyPoot
sending a special shout-out</i>

368
00:16:38,768 --> 00:16:40,185
to all the single ladies out...

369
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,044
Hey! Get out the car now!

370
00:16:42,145 --> 00:16:44,279
Step out!

371
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:47,453
Hands on the hood!

372
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:51,713
How did you get in there?
The doors were locked.

373
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,434
The passenger side wasn't.

374
00:17:01,264 --> 00:17:03,198
Stay here.

375
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:06,608
Yeah, I'm looking for my
wife, Isabel Bradford.

376
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:08,161
Ugh.

377
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:10,036
Isabel.

378
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:11,724
I'm fine, all right? They
shouldn't have called you.

379
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:13,651
Where the hell are you going?
You just O.D.'d.

380
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:15,506
I'm fine. They can't hold me.

381
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:17,012
- Let go.
- Stop.

382
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:18,546
Stop.

383
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:22,480
Do you know how many dead
junkies I've rolled up on

384
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:23,746
in the last month?

385
00:17:23,886 --> 00:17:25,820
Seized up, blue-lipped, all alone

386
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,552
because their buddies
didn't want to get caught

387
00:17:27,577 --> 00:17:30,045
- when the cops showed up?
- I said I'm fine.

388
00:17:30,113 --> 00:17:31,772
You don't want to come home!

389
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:33,840
Okay. I understand.

390
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:36,601
But if you keep doing this,
you are going to die!

391
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,914
Save the tough love for someone else.

392
00:17:38,951 --> 00:17:40,992
I am not your responsibility anymore,

393
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:42,751
so you do not get to have an opinion

394
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:44,275
about how I live my life.

395
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,336
So please stop trying
to be my white knight,

396
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:49,211
and leave me alone!

397
00:17:55,085 --> 00:17:56,619
Aah.

398
00:18:00,817 --> 00:18:02,354
Are you okay?

399
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:10,229
It's a tragedy.

400
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,868
See, I was at the game where
Cliffords blew out her knee.

401
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,017
You could see it in her face.
She knew her career was over.

402
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:16,842
And she didn't have a Plan "B."

403
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:19,040
Always got to have a
Plan "B" starting out.

404
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:21,964
- That's what I told the Boot.
- Yeah.

405
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:24,179
Sir, with all due respect,

406
00:18:24,407 --> 00:18:26,708
this has been my Plan "A"
since I was in diapers.

407
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:28,710
There's no way I don't see it through.

408
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,189
It's not always about you, Officer West.

409
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:34,903
This is a job where anything
can happen at any moment.

410
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,258
If that bullet hits Officer Bradford

411
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:40,234
six inches to the right,
he's paralyzed or worse.

412
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,511
Having a Plan "B" doesn't
mean you're not committed.

413
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:44,566
It means you're a realist.

414
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:50,919
7-Adam-19,

415
00:18:50,944 --> 00:18:52,351
<i>report of a biker gang,</i>

416
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:55,111
<i>drunk and disorderly
at The Hard Road bar.</i>

417
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:56,391
Are you okay to do this?

418
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:58,294
We can ask for another
unit to be assigned.

419
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:00,048
No. I'm fine.

420
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:05,669
How do you identify a
motorcycle club, Boot?

421
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:07,822
Uh, the three rockers on the
back of their jackets...

422
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,957
they show gang name, logo,
and state of origin.

423
00:19:11,227 --> 00:19:12,894
"Dead Bastards MC."

424
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:15,282
And which one of these guys
is the most dangerous?

425
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:18,394
See them? Those are Prospects.

426
00:19:18,494 --> 00:19:19,804
They haven't earned
their top rocker yet,

427
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:21,028
and there's only one way to get it...

428
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:22,986
commit a felony in view
of another gang member,

429
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:24,311
which means what?

430
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:26,799
Somebody's gonna fight us
when we get out of this car.

431
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:28,042
Exactly.

432
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,484
Shouldn't we call for backup, then?

433
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,253
Where's the fun in that?

434
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,818
Now, that's just sad.

435
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:42,063
Either you're man enough
to come at me or you're not.

436
00:19:42,292 --> 00:19:43,625
Now, who needs a felony?

437
00:19:43,678 --> 00:19:44,780
What are you doing?

438
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:46,073
Look, I'm not gonna repeat myself.

439
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:48,581
This is a one-time offer,
and it's about to expire.

440
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:50,782
You beat me, I won't even book you.

441
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:54,369
I beat you, you go to jail, and
your buddies hit the road.

442
00:19:54,924 --> 00:19:56,592
Come on, Jordan. You got this.

443
00:20:05,661 --> 00:20:06,928
Come on!

444
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:09,324
♪ Ooh ohh ohh

445
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:21,717
Ohh!

446
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,218
Let's go!

447
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:32,349
- Let's go!
- You lost!

448
00:20:32,395 --> 00:20:34,296
Let him go! Yeah, pig.

449
00:20:34,364 --> 00:20:35,731
- Let's go.
- Come on, man!

450
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,301
It was a fair fight!

451
00:20:38,453 --> 00:20:42,223
7-Adam-19, type change this
event to a felony assault,

452
00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:43,649
one in custody.

453
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,885
- What the hell was that?
- Good work, Jordy!

454
00:20:45,984 --> 00:20:47,521
Patrol work, Boot.

455
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,217
You planning on saying otherwise?

456
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,636
No, sir.

457
00:20:58,567 --> 00:20:59,634
Heard you were looking for me.

458
00:20:59,853 --> 00:21:01,127
Yeah.

459
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,352
Buddy in Beverly Hills PD just called.

460
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:05,102
The other two
members of that heist crew

461
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:07,227
knocked over a jewelers
on Cannon at lunchtime

462
00:21:07,262 --> 00:21:09,353
dressed as werewolves, shot a guard,

463
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:10,519
made off with eight grand.

464
00:21:10,544 --> 00:21:12,900
Well, I've got news
on the two we have in custody.

465
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:14,937
Detectives executed a search warrant

466
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:16,296
on the zombies' apartment.

467
00:21:16,385 --> 00:21:18,219
They found souvenirs from
robberies they committed

468
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:20,211
with the crew last year
in Dallas and Phoenix.

469
00:21:20,289 --> 00:21:21,885
- So they move around.
- Mm-hmm.

470
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:23,858
And with their partners on ice here,

471
00:21:23,937 --> 00:21:26,052
I bet you they are ready
to get out of Dodge.

472
00:21:26,127 --> 00:21:27,428
I'll alert patrol units.

473
00:21:27,596 --> 00:21:28,898
We got to find these guys.

474
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:30,698
Mm-hmm. Do that.

475
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:37,991
So, how do you want
to write this one up?

476
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,275
Carefully.

477
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:41,448
Grey's a stickler for proper procedure.

478
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:47,884
Well, if it isn't Officer PootyPoot.

479
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:49,677
Please come in.

480
00:21:50,332 --> 00:21:52,958
Put them on the bench. You, with me.

481
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:56,855
Officer Nolan,

482
00:21:57,553 --> 00:21:59,687
leaving a police vehicle unlocked

483
00:21:59,712 --> 00:22:02,440
so that your suspect
can give a shout-out

484
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:04,463
over the shop radio

485
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:06,600
is cause for discipline.

486
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:08,860
Carelessness like that will
not be tolerated here.

487
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:11,141
- Do you understand me?
- Understood, sir.

488
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,975
Now, what's gonna happen next...

489
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,335
Sir...

490
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,997
I left my door unlocked.

491
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,652
It wasn't Nolan.

492
00:22:20,676 --> 00:22:22,912
My office. Now.

493
00:22:29,959 --> 00:22:31,426
Get him processed.

494
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,074
W-What about the booking approval?

495
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:35,930
You made this arrest.

496
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,932
You saw what happened.

497
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,234
Write it up, Boot.

498
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:42,397
I'm gonna take any jewelry you have,

499
00:22:42,422 --> 00:22:44,523
any piercings, anything in your pockets,

500
00:22:44,548 --> 00:22:47,296
your socks, your shoes,
you're gonna give them to me.

501
00:22:48,457 --> 00:22:50,938
Can I talk to you?

502
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,676
- I'm worried about Tim.
- Why?

503
00:22:56,765 --> 00:22:58,830
He instigated a fight with a biker,

504
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:00,063
wouldn't let me call for backup,

505
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,029
could have gotten both of us killed.

506
00:23:02,831 --> 00:23:05,533
I think he's spinning
out, trying to prove himself.

507
00:23:05,604 --> 00:23:07,171
You think he came back too soon?

508
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:08,505
Maybe.

509
00:23:08,576 --> 00:23:09,767
He got hit with a lot of

510
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:11,477
personal stuff on top of it, too,

511
00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:13,158
and he's not handling it well.

512
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,514
Clearly you have to do something.

513
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:18,580
Yeah, but what? Tim is my T.O.

514
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:20,300
I'm not gonna narc on him.

515
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,147
Then you're gonna have to talk to him.

516
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,467
Oh...

517
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:29,517
It's not gonna go well.

518
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,251
What other choice do you have?

519
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:36,224
Six doses of NARCAN.

520
00:23:36,352 --> 00:23:37,752
Throwing quite a party, huh?

521
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,534
Hey. Biker's processed.

522
00:23:40,848 --> 00:23:42,571
Do we really need all that?

523
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:44,539
Look, there's a bad batch of fentanyl

524
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:46,103
making the rounds out there.

525
00:23:46,189 --> 00:23:48,457
Miller went through his entire
overdose kit in two days.

526
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:52,789
You gonna tell me. how it
went with Sergeant Grey?

527
00:23:52,814 --> 00:23:55,031
He put me on undocumented
oral counseling.

528
00:23:55,224 --> 00:23:57,888
- For leaving a door unlocked?
- I deserve it. I lost focus.

529
00:23:57,913 --> 00:23:59,552
But at least it's not on my record.

530
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:01,800
Look, I appreciate you
trying to cover for me.

531
00:24:01,825 --> 00:24:02,839
No problem.

532
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:05,064
But it doesn't mean you're right
about how you see people, though.

533
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:07,161
You think I did that to
try and prove a point?

534
00:24:07,276 --> 00:24:09,406
Trust me, I'm no Gandhi.

535
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:10,776
I just don't think someone's
life should be ruined

536
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,160
because of one bad day.

537
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:15,695
You're my partner...
my training officer...

538
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:17,792
and I've got your back,
even if you think

539
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:20,590
I'm one bad lunch order
away from a life of crime.

540
00:24:21,484 --> 00:24:23,318
I saw you rolling your eyes.

541
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:28,346
7-Adam-19, show us Code 6,

542
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:30,325
Florence and Central Avenue.

543
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:32,200
Stay here.

544
00:24:44,586 --> 00:24:46,854
You deaf, Boot? I said stay in the car.

545
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:48,930
You're not helping her.
You're enabling her.

546
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:51,104
You know this because
you're some shrink's kid?

547
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:54,221
She's gonna shoot up, okay?
That's the reality.

548
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:55,595
This will save her life.

549
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:57,531
Addiction doesn't just
destroy the addict.

550
00:24:57,556 --> 00:24:58,780
It destroys the family, too.

551
00:24:58,804 --> 00:24:59,877
Who the hell are you to tell me this?

552
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:02,498
- You think I don't know?
- I'm your rookie.

553
00:25:02,665 --> 00:25:04,721
And I need you to train
me, not put me in danger

554
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:06,747
because you can't handle
losing your wife.

555
00:25:11,687 --> 00:25:14,852
Look, at least let me go up.

556
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:18,671
If you do, it'll just
confirm your worst fears.

557
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,871
Do you really want to
see how she's living

558
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,782
or who she's living with?

559
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:29,426
Paramedics said it's apartment 510.

560
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,753
Isabel, just...

561
00:25:45,787 --> 00:25:46,988
- Wait. Wait.
- Go away.

562
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:48,856
Y-You can't come in without a warrant.

563
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:50,992
My name is Officer Lucy Chen.

564
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:52,960
Tim Bradford's my T.O.

565
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:54,427
He's downstairs.

566
00:25:54,556 --> 00:25:55,640
If you don't give me five minutes,

567
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:57,931
he's gonna come up here
and break this door down.

568
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:09,477
So, what do you want?

569
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:12,503
Do you know

570
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:14,044
your husband was shot recently?

571
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,789
We got ambushed.

572
00:26:15,918 --> 00:26:18,119
He took a bullet while returning fire.

573
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:19,360
That's what you're doing here?

574
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:20,752
'Cause he seems fine.

575
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,594
Um... it's NARCAN.

576
00:26:27,113 --> 00:26:28,175
It won't get you clean,

577
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,305
just reverse the effects of an O.D.

578
00:26:31,787 --> 00:26:33,240
I know what NARCAN is.

579
00:26:33,265 --> 00:26:35,600
Spent a decade bringing junkies
back from the dead with it.

580
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:38,135
- You were a nurse?
- No. A cop.

581
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,596
Narcotics.

582
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:40,891
He didn't tell you?

583
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:47,183
He doesn't really talk about you. I...

584
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,392
That's good.

585
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:52,946
So, you guys were on the force together?

586
00:26:53,088 --> 00:26:54,227
Different divisions.

587
00:26:54,295 --> 00:26:57,024
I, uh... I worked out of the 77th,

588
00:26:57,125 --> 00:27:00,094
volunteered for undercover
as soon as I could.

589
00:27:00,221 --> 00:27:02,052
Tim was happy on patrol, so...

590
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:04,213
we synched our shifts as best we could.

591
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,607
It was perfect... till it wasn't.

592
00:27:06,762 --> 00:27:08,930
So, anyway...

593
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:15,689
Uh...

594
00:27:15,777 --> 00:27:18,713
Hey, um, he really got shot?

595
00:27:20,214 --> 00:27:21,483
Yeah.

596
00:27:21,964 --> 00:27:23,731
Yeah. It was scary.

597
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:29,271
Don't let him come back here.

598
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:30,824
There's no future here.

599
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:13,118
She was a cop.

600
00:28:20,337 --> 00:28:24,237
I-I, uh, thought. she
was having an affair.

601
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:28,927
Staying out late, making excuses.

602
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:32,497
I didn't realize it was the drugs

603
00:28:32,522 --> 00:28:34,665
until the hook was in deep.

604
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,670
Her apartment is pretty decent.

605
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:52,095
Thanks.

606
00:28:59,903 --> 00:29:03,515
You could be a nurse or get into I.T.

607
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:05,517
There's always clown college.

608
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,193
Look, I don't need a Plan "B,"

609
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:08,949
and if I did, it wouldn't
be from some pamphlet

610
00:29:08,974 --> 00:29:10,296
you grabbed off the community board.

611
00:29:10,363 --> 00:29:12,698
How do you think I got
the idea for the LAPD?

612
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,756
Lopez, West, the zombie robbers

613
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:15,881
just flipped on their partners.

614
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,169
SWAT's hitting the house.

615
00:29:17,204 --> 00:29:18,638
We're providing tactical support.

616
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:20,717
Meet in the bullpen in five.

617
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:22,837
All right, let's get started.

618
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:26,212
Our targets
are Steve Bower, Kai De Vera.

619
00:29:26,337 --> 00:29:27,793
Bit of an odd couple.

620
00:29:27,854 --> 00:29:30,748
Bower's known for
at least six hard-core 2-11s,

621
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:33,052
a lot of collateral damage in his wake.

622
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,470
De Vera did two tours as a
door gunner on a Black Hawk,

623
00:29:36,537 --> 00:29:37,960
was under the radar till she hooked up

624
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,360
with Bower about a year ago.

625
00:29:39,393 --> 00:29:41,953
Remember, if anything,
she's far more dangerous than he is.

626
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:44,170
Sergeant Laubacher will be
giving you the briefing.

627
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:46,499
He's in charge of tonight's
operation, so listen up.

628
00:29:46,803 --> 00:29:48,401
Thank you, Captain.

629
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,404
Targets are at a house in the
hills over the Sunset Strip.

630
00:29:51,704 --> 00:29:54,241
Ingress is limited, so
we'll be coming in hot.

631
00:29:54,374 --> 00:29:56,505
Team one will be primary entry,

632
00:29:56,558 --> 00:29:58,444
deploying flash bangs
and breaching tools.

633
00:29:58,775 --> 00:30:02,312
Team two... break and
rake the back glass door.

634
00:30:02,449 --> 00:30:05,248
Tactical support.
..you're outer perimeter.

635
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:07,229
Sergeant Grey has your positions.

636
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:09,588
We'll go through detailed
assignments on the drive in.

637
00:30:10,194 --> 00:30:11,757
My team, let's go.

638
00:30:12,094 --> 00:30:13,144
Get to it.

639
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:15,301
All right.

640
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:17,300
See, we could do this whole
thing in five minutes

641
00:30:17,325 --> 00:30:19,122
without flash bangs and BearCats,

642
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:21,610
but SWAT has us on guard duty,

643
00:30:21,843 --> 00:30:24,376
so make sure they take it seriously.

644
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:27,031
I don't want to be embarrassed
at the next Special Ops picnic.

645
00:30:27,174 --> 00:30:29,117
- Yes, sir.
- We won't let you down, Sergeant.

646
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:35,167
Is there really a Special Ops picnic?

647
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,643
I didn't think so.

648
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,807
Sucks we have to be down here.

649
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,091
Yeah, well, get used to it.

650
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:54,564
Patrol is lowest on the totem pole

651
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,049
when it comes to operations like this.

652
00:30:56,122 --> 00:30:58,424
Perimeter watch is a necessary
part of police work.

653
00:30:58,452 --> 00:30:59,652
It's nothing to look down on.

654
00:30:59,677 --> 00:31:00,940
- Is he for real?
- Yep.

655
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:02,308
Doesn't have a Plan "B," though.

656
00:31:02,447 --> 00:31:04,310
What? Well, that's just crazy.

657
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:06,278
I've been dealing with
this crap all day.

658
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,519
Officer Nolan, this is
your Plan "B," right?

659
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,449
Uh, more like Plan "D."

660
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:12,066
First it was astronaut, then law school,

661
00:31:12,091 --> 00:31:13,486
then construction, then this.

662
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:15,619
If this doesn't work out,
I'm thinking beauty school.

663
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:20,826
Should we go up there?

664
00:31:20,935 --> 00:31:23,662
No. But we should spread out
and cover the perimeter.

665
00:31:30,143 --> 00:31:32,438
<i>Shots fired.
Shots fired. Suspects at large.</i>

666
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:42,200
Stop!

667
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:13,147
Do we go after them?

668
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:18,918
7-Adam-15 in pursuit of
armed robbery suspects,

669
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:20,306
heading south towards Franklin.

670
00:32:20,343 --> 00:32:22,719
<i>7-Adam-15, what street are suspects on?</i>

671
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:24,870
They're not on a street. They're
running down the side of the canyon.

672
00:32:24,894 --> 00:32:26,098
Aren't we supposed to have an airship?

673
00:32:26,122 --> 00:32:27,523
En route.

674
00:32:28,892 --> 00:32:30,025
God, does it ever feel normal?

675
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,827
- What?
- Just getting shot at,

676
00:32:31,861 --> 00:32:33,312
people trying to kill
you for doing your job.

677
00:32:33,336 --> 00:32:34,669
- Yes.
- Really?

678
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:36,698
About as normal as taking a
parent away from their kid,

679
00:32:36,766 --> 00:32:38,100
but we signed up for it all.

680
00:32:38,134 --> 00:32:39,287
If ever you start to get numb to it,

681
00:32:39,312 --> 00:32:40,619
you know it's time to
turn in your papers.

682
00:32:40,643 --> 00:32:42,945
How could anyone feel
numb to any of this?

683
00:32:43,106 --> 00:32:44,902
There! Just jumped the last ravine.

684
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:46,518
Control, suspects are down on the flats,

685
00:32:46,543 --> 00:32:48,303
heading for Western.
Where's that backup?

686
00:32:48,371 --> 00:32:50,572
7-Adam-19, we're inbound to assist.

687
00:32:50,947 --> 00:32:52,094
There.

688
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,437
7-Adam-19, we'll
take Bower, you take her.

689
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,247
7-Adam-15, we are
Code 6 at Saint Gregory's.

690
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:14,062
We have suspect at
large in the hospital.

691
00:33:17,413 --> 00:33:19,381
Did a woman in a green
Army jacket run through here?

692
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:21,336
Down that hallway.

693
00:33:21,405 --> 00:33:23,154
Get the elevators. and
first floor in lockdown.

694
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:25,088
We have an armed suspect on the loose.

695
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,850
We have a code grey, code grey.

696
00:33:32,822 --> 00:33:34,590
Flashlights on, Boot.

697
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,959
Eyes right. I got
the left side covered.

698
00:33:46,075 --> 00:33:48,980
7-Adam-19, shots fired at our location.

699
00:33:49,005 --> 00:33:50,623
Requesting backup and airship.

700
00:33:55,312 --> 00:33:56,979
The good news is he's trapped.

701
00:33:58,989 --> 00:34:02,563
If I go over this trailer,
I'll come up on top of him.

702
00:34:02,946 --> 00:34:04,546
With all due respect, I should go.

703
00:34:04,727 --> 00:34:05,993
Forget it.

704
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,693
Improvisation is a useful
tool for a rookie to learn.

705
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,436
Good. All right. You
passed tonight's test.

706
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:21,396
Get your ass up there.

707
00:34:43,934 --> 00:34:45,000
Police!

708
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,328
Drop your weapon!

709
00:34:46,607 --> 00:34:48,120
Do it now!

710
00:34:48,718 --> 00:34:50,052
Get down on your stomach!

711
00:34:55,605 --> 00:34:57,675
Hands behind your back.

712
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,210
What do you want... applause?

713
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,084
Get down here.

714
00:35:03,279 --> 00:35:05,214
7-Adam-19, Code 4.

715
00:35:05,307 --> 00:35:07,175
One in custody, one outstanding.

716
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:10,266
Careful. This girl was a door gunner

717
00:35:10,291 --> 00:35:11,780
for a Black Hawk helicopter,

718
00:35:11,894 --> 00:35:13,581
not some crackhead with a 9-mil.

719
00:35:13,629 --> 00:35:15,996
<i>7-Adam-08 is in place on east entrance.</i>

720
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:18,691
<i>Additional units en
route to assist in search.</i>

721
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:21,534
All right, every exit's secure.

722
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:22,923
We just need to flush her out.

723
00:35:22,948 --> 00:35:24,266
No.

724
00:35:24,396 --> 00:35:25,446
No what?

725
00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:27,610
Every exit is not secure.

726
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,593
7-Adam-15 to air support.

727
00:35:57,634 --> 00:36:00,028
Armed suspect has stolen
medevac helicopter

728
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:01,567
from the roof. of Saint
Gregory Hospital.

729
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:03,578
Request you respond and intercept.

730
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,218
Drop your gun.

731
00:36:19,837 --> 00:36:21,738
No. But I-I'll put it away.

732
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:26,229
Okay, okay, um...

733
00:36:26,473 --> 00:36:27,958
now what?

734
00:36:28,046 --> 00:36:30,480
I shoot you and take my
chances in the hospital

735
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:33,278
after the cops clear out
chasing the helicopter.

736
00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:35,438
Can I offer an alternate suggestion?

737
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:37,579
- No.
- Look...

738
00:36:38,518 --> 00:36:39,656
I don't know you, okay?

739
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:43,160
Just... Just what was on your BOLO.

740
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:45,996
Two tours, wounded in action.

741
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,540
Y-You're an honest-to-God American hero.

742
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,529
Who's about to put a hollow
point through your skull.

743
00:36:50,721 --> 00:36:53,124
- Still think I'm a hero?
- Yes.

744
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:57,171
Yes, because you're not gonna do that.

745
00:36:58,589 --> 00:37:03,085
My training offer says that
people are inherently flawed,

746
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:07,228
that they're only good when it's easy.

747
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:11,003
And when things get challenging,
they make a bad call

748
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:12,455
and then another, and then pretty soon

749
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,057
you can't see good in
your rearview mirror.

750
00:37:15,146 --> 00:37:18,191
- She says that once you
cross that line, you can't go back,

751
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:20,630
but I-I don't... I don't believe that.

752
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,903
I-I think you can.

753
00:37:23,187 --> 00:37:27,822
I think that good people
will make the right choice

754
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:29,799
when it really matters.

755
00:37:32,009 --> 00:37:34,376
Look, if I... if I'm wrong...

756
00:37:36,326 --> 00:37:38,207
...then you kill me.

757
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:42,831
But if I'm right...

758
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:47,847
then you just give up because
this is a line you won't cross.

759
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,141
Aah!

760
00:37:57,962 --> 00:38:00,130
Remind me not to get on your bad side.

761
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:03,523
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yep.

762
00:38:07,335 --> 00:38:08,545
Guess now we'll never know...

763
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:11,563
...what choice she was gonna make.

764
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:14,497
You're the only one still in
doubt here, Officer Nolan.

765
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,052
I just saved your life.

766
00:38:17,949 --> 00:38:19,922
Well, in that case...

767
00:38:20,402 --> 00:38:21,882
thank you.

768
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:30,967
Officer Nolan,

769
00:38:31,114 --> 00:38:32,769
did you bail out your train thief?

770
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,704
No.

771
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:36,606
I did.

772
00:38:36,895 --> 00:38:38,074
He made a mistake.

773
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:40,210
He's got a kid, and he
deserves to be at home,

774
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,548
not in some prison because
he can't make bail.

775
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,462
Officer Bishop, I didn't
take you for a softie.

776
00:38:44,528 --> 00:38:46,149
I'm not.

777
00:38:46,232 --> 00:38:49,047
But one bad day. shouldn't
ruin a man's life.

778
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:50,640
Okay.

779
00:38:52,356 --> 00:38:53,957
What?

780
00:38:53,991 --> 00:38:55,125
I want to give you a hug.

781
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,426
Do you want to get Tased?

782
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,927
No. It passed.

783
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:00,156
Let's ask the captain.

784
00:39:01,198 --> 00:39:02,280
Ask me what?

785
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,638
What was your Plan "B"?

786
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:05,939
I didn't have one. I was all-in.

787
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,274
Nothing was
gonna stop me from being a cop.

788
00:39:08,806 --> 00:39:09,906
Turned out pretty well.

789
00:39:10,016 --> 00:39:12,108
- I agree, Captain.
- Whatever.

790
00:39:34,285 --> 00:39:35,725
Hard day?

791
00:39:38,148 --> 00:39:39,645
Yeah.

792
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,960
You didn't tell me your partner
got shot along with you.

793
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,385
I might have done some poking around.

794
00:39:50,728 --> 00:39:54,164
Dennis Rowland. Bad temper, good heart.

795
00:39:54,503 --> 00:39:56,353
We were together two years.

796
00:39:56,587 --> 00:39:58,688
Bullet went through him, hit me.

797
00:39:58,775 --> 00:39:59,956
I walked away. He didn't.

798
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,498
I'm sorry.

799
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:05,466
Thanks.

800
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:10,540
Now, are you ready for
the "So you got shot"

801
00:40:10,935 --> 00:40:13,730
and didn't listen to me and
pushed yourself too hard,

802
00:40:13,755 --> 00:40:16,306
"but now you know I'm right" speech?

803
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:17,657
Sounds like a long one.

804
00:40:17,723 --> 00:40:18,991
Oh, it is.

805
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:21,892
Come on. I'll give it
to you over a beer.

806
00:40:25,987 --> 00:40:27,484
Ah. How's that Plan "B" coming?

807
00:40:27,624 --> 00:40:29,419
Captain says I don't need one.

808
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:31,634
But I was thinking

809
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:34,302
it might not be a bad idea

810
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,128
for me to find a hobby,

811
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:38,261
something outside of the
job I can look forward to.

812
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:41,498
Mm. What about, uh, pole dancing?

813
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,870
Okay, clearly, I shouldn't
have brought you

814
00:40:43,895 --> 00:40:45,021
into the circle of trust.

815
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:46,858
What?

816
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:49,475
You know, you were, uh,
pretty cavalier earlier

817
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:51,508
about not making it as a cop.

818
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:53,142
Is that how you really feel?

819
00:40:54,672 --> 00:40:57,384
I'm seeing this thing
through no matter what,

820
00:40:57,862 --> 00:41:00,597
no matter what obstacles
are thrown in my way.

821
00:41:03,387 --> 00:41:06,869
You know, one out
of three rookies washes out

822
00:41:06,894 --> 00:41:09,001
during their first year.

823
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:11,561
And there's three of us.

824
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:14,029
Odds are, one of us isn't gonna make it.

825
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,040
Screw the odds.

826
00:41:17,216 --> 00:41:19,035
If I believed in odds...

827
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:20,470
...I wouldn't even be here.

828
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:23,894
You know what? We're all
gonna make it because

829
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:26,884
we're gonna have each other's
backs no matter what.

830
00:41:27,304 --> 00:41:28,396
Deal?

831
00:41:28,501 --> 00:41:29,555
Deal.

832
00:41:29,586 --> 00:41:30,853
- Yeah.
- Deal.

833
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:33,798
Okay, I'm going on a night run.

834
00:41:33,878 --> 00:41:35,118
Who's with me?

835
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:36,419
Me. Totally.

836
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:38,555
Yeah. We're right behind you.

837
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,293
♪ Bye-bye, baby
