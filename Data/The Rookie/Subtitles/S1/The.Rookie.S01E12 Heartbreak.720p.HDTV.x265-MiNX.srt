1
00:00:00,984 --> 00:00:03,017
I'll take that. Thank you.

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,226
Small of your back?
No!

3
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:13,072
Mm!
Uh, left ankle?

4
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:14,209
Oh, so close.
Right ankle.

5
00:00:14,244 --> 00:00:15,343
W... Hold on. It's my turn.

6
00:00:15,378 --> 00:00:17,429
You don't get to go twice.
Favorite body parts?

7
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:18,523
I don't...

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,202
Guessing where we keep
our off-duty weapon.

9
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:22,957
Oh!
Wait. Hold on. Let me guess.

10
00:00:22,994 --> 00:00:24,426
Ankle holster...

11
00:00:24,554 --> 00:00:26,093
like most old-timers.

12
00:00:26,186 --> 00:00:27,986
Okay, "A," I'm not an old-timer.

13
00:00:28,023 --> 00:00:29,822
You're confusing age with experience.

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,726
"B," not even close.

15
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,098
He doesn't even carry
an off-duty piece.

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,017
I'm sorry. How did I not know that?

17
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:37,484
I'm still getting used to carrying

18
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:38,702
a loaded weapon on the job.

19
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,132
I don't know that I could handle

20
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:41,935
packing heat in my real life.

21
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,481
Oh, no.
What?

22
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:48,285
Sgt. Grey is sitting
over there with his wife.

23
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:49,694
He's coming over here.

24
00:00:49,804 --> 00:00:51,144
Oh, man.

25
00:00:53,984 --> 00:00:55,110
Hey!

26
00:00:55,147 --> 00:00:57,047
Hey. Small world.

27
00:00:57,084 --> 00:00:58,817
Too small right now.

28
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:00,499
You know, for 19 years,

29
00:01:00,536 --> 00:01:03,504
my wife and I have gone out
on February 13th.

30
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,991
Why the 13th, you ask?

31
00:01:05,028 --> 00:01:06,491
Because the 14th, Valentine's Day,

32
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:07,874
is for amateurs.

33
00:01:07,911 --> 00:01:11,194
The 13th is calm and relaxed.

34
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:13,017
It's easy to find a table.

35
00:01:13,054 --> 00:01:15,484
There's no overpriced Prix-Fixe meals.

36
00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:17,788
It's just me and my lovely bride...

37
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,244
good food, a warm conversation,

38
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,632
a place where I can

39
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:23,437
not think about the job
for a little while.

40
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:25,913
Sounds nice... sir.

41
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,640
It is, which is why
on my special night,

42
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:30,567
I don't want to see your faces.

43
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:32,523
So by the time I walk back to my table,

44
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,007
you will be gone.

45
00:01:34,044 --> 00:01:35,208
Am I clear?

46
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:37,390
Crystal.
Like ghosts.

47
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,959
Have a good evening.

48
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:45,331
Okay. Shall we?
Yeah.

49
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,562
Sorry about that.
It's okay.

50
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:52,472
Everything all right?
Yeah, it's fine.

51
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:55,141
To us.
To us.

52
00:01:57,065 --> 00:01:58,665
Get off me.
What's taking so long?

53
00:01:58,702 --> 00:01:59,914
I'm fine, thank you.
Hey!

54
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:01,212
Can we get our drink?!
Get off me!

55
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:02,348
Nolan, let's go.

56
00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:04,016
She needs help.
You heard Grey.

57
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:05,492
Get off me.
Go get her a drink.

58
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:07,449
What's taking so long? Come on.
Miss, are you all right?

59
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:08,765
He bought me a drink I don't want,

60
00:02:08,802 --> 00:02:10,002
and he's not taking no for an answer.

61
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,404
All right, time to leave
the girl alone.

62
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:13,305
Get your own girl. This one's mine.

63
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:14,819
All I'm saying

64
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:17,029
is that the house
is gonna be empty soon,

65
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:19,466
and we can do whatever we want.

66
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:21,265
Well, it's not gonna be empty.

67
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:23,234
I mean, Dominique will be
coming home from college.

68
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:25,371
And that home can be anywhere.

69
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:29,885
Will you just think about it, okay?

70
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:34,546
Watch out, watch out.

71
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:36,915
Whoa!

72
00:02:41,937 --> 00:02:44,593
Oops.

73
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:56,535
Hello?

74
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,594
<i>Mr. Nolan, it's Dave at Flower Town.</i>

75
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:00,978
<i>Uh, we're having a little trouble
delivering your Valentine's order</i>

76
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,614
<i>of two dozen roses for your wife.</i>

77
00:03:02,903 --> 00:03:05,237
Oh, uh, Dave.

78
00:03:05,274 --> 00:03:08,409
Yeah, I actually won't be
needing that delivery this year.

79
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:10,586
<i>What?</i>
Uh...

80
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:13,704
Sarah and I got divorced.
I'm living in L.A. now.

81
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:15,931
<i>Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that.</i>

82
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:17,835
<i>I mean, hell, your standing order</i>

83
00:03:17,872 --> 00:03:19,747
<i>is as old as my shop, 20 years.</i>

84
00:03:19,827 --> 00:03:21,226
Yeah, yeah, it was hard,

85
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:23,595
but, um... uh...

86
00:03:23,632 --> 00:03:25,046
it's for the best, you know?

87
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:27,116
People change.
That's just human nature.

88
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:28,486
It's easy to feel like you failed,

89
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:29,889
but truth is, at the end of the day,

90
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:31,067
we raised a great kid.

91
00:03:31,104 --> 00:03:33,155
I don't have to tell you, Dave.
I know you have kids.

92
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:36,063
Dave?

93
00:03:36,176 --> 00:03:38,513
<i>Sorry, had to put you
on hold there for a sec.</i>

94
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,318
<i>So, what would you like me
to do with the flowers?</i>

95
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:43,281
You know what?
Just deliver them to the hospital.

96
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,876
I'm sure someone there
would appreciate them.

97
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:46,747
Thanks.

98
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:50,655
Ohh.

99
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,722
Wow!

100
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,128
You okay?

101
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,622
I hit my head.

102
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,468
You locked the door.
Weirdest thing.

103
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:04,114
This guy keeps wandering
into my house uninvited.

104
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:06,864
You know...

105
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,606
it's Valentine's Day.

106
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:10,864
Yes, I was just reminded.

107
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:13,333
It's your first one alone. Ever.

108
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:15,504
So I thought maybe we could do
something after your shift.

109
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,007
You know, help get your mind off it.

110
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,403
Like?

111
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:19,954
You can invite some friends over.

112
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:21,942
I'll cater it. Yeah.

113
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:23,353
Wolfgang owes me a favor.

114
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,788
Yeah!
Yes?

115
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:26,490
Yeah, that sounds like fun!

116
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:28,645
That's awesome!
Okay, good. Now get out.

117
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,030
We didn't really think this through.

118
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,005
I totally forgot what today was.

119
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:36,284
I probably should've picked
a less loaded day

120
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:38,395
for our first sleepover.

121
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:41,239
Um... I didn't get you a gift.

122
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:42,686
Oh.

123
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:45,624
Well, then it's gonna be super awkward

124
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:47,169
when your presents get here.

125
00:04:47,224 --> 00:04:48,812
I guess I can still
cancel the violinist.

126
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:51,648
I'm kidding.

127
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:53,388
Forgot it was Valentine's Day, too.

128
00:04:53,427 --> 00:04:56,361
So, we'll just have to settle for this.

129
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,051
Hmm.

130
00:04:59,088 --> 00:05:00,287
When can I see you again?

131
00:05:00,324 --> 00:05:02,388
Um... Saturday?

132
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,080
Oh, I have to drive up
to Salinas Prison

133
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:06,520
to meet a client.

134
00:05:06,587 --> 00:05:08,395
You could come with.
Make a weekend out of it.

135
00:05:08,462 --> 00:05:10,681
Sounds romantic.
Could be.

136
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,520
Um...

137
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:14,411
maybe next time.

138
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,608
You're not having second thoughts

139
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:17,059
about dating the enemy, are you?

140
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:18,362
Defense attorneys aren't the enemy.

141
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:19,498
They're just a pain in the ass

142
00:05:19,535 --> 00:05:20,667
we have to deal with on the daily.

143
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:22,070
'Cause we hold you accountable.

144
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:23,974
Because...
Uh-huh?

145
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:25,255
Nope. Not going there.

146
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,557
<i>That's</i> my gift to you.

147
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:34,357
Well, wish me luck.

148
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:36,583
I'm going in front of
Judge Bollard this morning.

149
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,328
He eats defense attorneys
for breakfast.

150
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:39,759
If anyone can charm him, it's you.

151
00:05:43,036 --> 00:05:44,376
Mmm.

152
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:46,203
All right, we know what today is.

153
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,607
The most dangerous day of our year.

154
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,216
Valentine's Day, sir? Really?

155
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:52,599
Not Black Friday, not New Year's?

156
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:54,716
That's right, Officer Nolan.

157
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:56,555
Breakups and broken hearts.

158
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,380
Jealousy and revenge.

159
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:00,559
All make for a perfect storm

160
00:06:00,596 --> 00:06:03,716
of heightened emotion
and dangerous situations.

161
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:06,653
Hell, sometimes violence can find you

162
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,763
minding your own business at dinner.

163
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,954
Sir, again, I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

164
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:15,303
I'm not the one that needs
the apologies, Officer Nolan.

165
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,263
Yes, sir. Please apologize
to your wife for me.

166
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:19,038
If you'd like me to make you
another reservation...

167
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:21,169
I traded shifts for<i> last</i> night off.

168
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:23,614
The night you ruined.
Yes, sir.

169
00:06:23,713 --> 00:06:26,213
Uh, sir? I don't see my T.O.

170
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,294
Officer Bradford's
taken a personal day.

171
00:06:28,331 --> 00:06:29,732
You're kidding, Tim hasn't taken

172
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:31,302
a personal day in his entire life.

173
00:06:31,362 --> 00:06:33,797
Be that as it may, he's off today.

174
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,216
So, Chen, you'll be assigned
to the front desk.

175
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:38,720
All right. That's it.
Everybody be safe out there.

176
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:48,540
Hi.

177
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,306
I didn't think you'd come.

178
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:54,035
Yeah, I almost pulled a U-turn.

179
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,006
Twice.

180
00:06:56,089 --> 00:06:57,822
Glad you didn't.

181
00:06:58,498 --> 00:06:59,963
You look great.

182
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,908
For someone who got shot in the head.

183
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:05,634
No, I-I mean you look like<i> you</i> again.

184
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,392
How are you feeling?

185
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:12,431
The beginning was really rough,

186
00:07:12,783 --> 00:07:14,452
but it would've been worse
if I didn't already

187
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:15,953
go through withdrawal in the hospital.

188
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:18,126
I'm... I'm proud of you
for seeing it through.

189
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,915
You didn't think I would.

190
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,150
No.

191
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:25,521
But I-I hoped I was wrong.

192
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:29,087
Yeah, well, I thought about
leaving every day.

193
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:31,602
What made you stay?

194
00:07:31,675 --> 00:07:33,962
I found something I
wanted more than a fix.

195
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:37,276
For you to see me sober.

196
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:39,746
Well... guess my job here is done.

197
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:41,376
See ya.

198
00:07:46,118 --> 00:07:48,376
Come on.
All right.

199
00:07:48,556 --> 00:07:50,574
So, I'm having
a little get-together tonight.

200
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:52,621
Kind of an anti-Valentine thing.

201
00:07:52,658 --> 00:07:53,902
Ben's having it catered.

202
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,093
Sadly, I'm not doing anything else.

203
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:57,910
Well, if Jackson's in, I'm in.

204
00:07:57,947 --> 00:08:00,130
Wow. Way to make me feel like
a consolation prize.

205
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:02,265
Since when are you
anti-Valentine's Day?

206
00:08:02,345 --> 00:08:03,845
You're a romantic.

207
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:05,981
Well, I-I mean...
I mean, you<i> seem</i> like one.

208
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,777
Yes, well, traditionally, yes,

209
00:08:07,814 --> 00:08:09,306
but, uh, this year,

210
00:08:09,341 --> 00:08:10,808
I thought I'd just embrace
the single life.

211
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,837
Shouldn't you be
at the front desk, Boot?

212
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,377
Oh. Right.

213
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,376
Sorry. Muscle memory.

214
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:19,047
I don't need the gear today, so...

215
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:20,970
S-Sorry.

216
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,730
Ladies!

217
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:26,472
O-Officers, I'm having
a little get-together tonight.

218
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,325
Love if you could join.
Pass.

219
00:08:28,537 --> 00:08:29,636
Officer Bishop?

220
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:31,060
Don't even bother with her.

221
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:32,795
You have plans?
Yes.

222
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:35,275
No.
Don't start.

223
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,367
Talia.

224
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,069
What comes after awkward?

225
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:41,689
That.

226
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:46,847
So you going out with Wesley tonight?

227
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:48,177
Nope.

228
00:08:48,388 --> 00:08:50,052
Why not?

229
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:52,348
You're getting a little
familiar, Officer West.

230
00:08:52,383 --> 00:08:53,958
We're not friends, we're friendly.

231
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,677
You do understand the difference.

232
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:58,054
Yes, ma'am.
Your personal life is personal.

233
00:08:58,244 --> 00:08:59,583
Exactly.

234
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,223
So, uh...

235
00:09:03,114 --> 00:09:04,527
he did get me a gift.

236
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:05,952
He didn't think I saw it, but I did.

237
00:09:05,989 --> 00:09:07,730
Does that mean I need
to get him something?

238
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,398
I mean, do you want
to get him something?

239
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,367
Lord, no. Men are
impossible to shop for.

240
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:12,521
Who needs the pressure?

241
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:14,325
You better run!

242
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:16,203
You better run!
Good God.

243
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,606
Men should never run naked.

244
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:18,874
I'll kill you!

245
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:20,469
Looks like Valentine's Day
is starting early.

246
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:21,976
You're tackling the naked one!

247
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:26,004
You know, being on my own
for once is actually liberating.

248
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,926
Mm-hmm. Keep trying to
convince yourself of that.

249
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,720
I mean, I can see how it might
make someone feel less than.

250
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:35,896
The secret is just to see the positive.

251
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,894
That's just my plan for the day.

252
00:09:38,997 --> 00:09:41,239
What about you?
What about me?

253
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:43,719
Well, Lopez was giving you a hard
time about your plans tonight.

254
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:45,823
I realized I don't know anything
about your personal life.

255
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:47,732
Are you single? Dating?

256
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:49,716
In a relationship?
No.

257
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,872
That's... unhelpful.
Exactly.

258
00:09:53,962 --> 00:09:56,095
Valentine's Day is
a manufactured holiday

259
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:58,128
that does nothing but make
those alone feel lonelier.

260
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:00,749
And those who are in
relationships feel disappointed

261
00:10:00,786 --> 00:10:02,755
because life isn't a fairy tale.

262
00:10:03,953 --> 00:10:06,721
Is that why Lopez said not
to bother inviting you?

263
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:08,818
'Cause of your hatred of
all things love-related?

264
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:10,250
Not at all.

265
00:10:10,287 --> 00:10:12,396
I would<i> love</i> to fail you
on your evaluation

266
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:14,166
if you bring up Valentine's Day again.

267
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,663
Copy that.

268
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,769
Mind your business!
I'm just checking the blind spot,

269
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:24,497
make sure there's no one.

270
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,739
<i>7-Adam-15, single car accident.</i>

271
00:10:26,776 --> 00:10:29,244
<i>1530 Crescent Heights.
Unknown injuries.</i>

272
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:31,223
7-Adam-15 responding.

273
00:10:38,255 --> 00:10:41,114
Control, show us Code 6,
1350 Crescent Heights.

274
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:43,184
We have a power line down. Alert DWP.

275
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,031
Ma'am, stay in the car! It's not safe!

276
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:47,615
She's in shock. Don't!

277
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:49,708
We have to do something.

278
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,191
I'm going.

279
00:10:58,684 --> 00:11:00,216
Ma'am.

280
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:02,652
Come on! Come on.

281
00:11:11,728 --> 00:11:14,189
Here we go. Easy. Okay.

282
00:11:14,226 --> 00:11:15,986
Control, send an RA to our location.

283
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,510
We have an adult female, 30s,

284
00:11:17,547 --> 00:11:19,981
not conscious, not breathing,
electric-shock victim.

285
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:24,642
Come on.

286
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:33,168
Hey!

287
00:11:33,461 --> 00:11:35,428
Hey. Welcome back.

288
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:37,353
What happened?
Try not to move.

289
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:39,916
You were electrocuted.
An ambulance is on its way.

290
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,302
Did you save me?

291
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:44,558
Uh...

292
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,799
uh, well, yeah. Yeah.

293
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,941
Thank you.

294
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:51,033
Of course.

295
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:56,315
Next.

296
00:11:56,658 --> 00:11:58,518
Hi. Uh...

297
00:11:58,642 --> 00:12:00,286
I need to talk to a vice cop.

298
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,854
Okay, about what?

299
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,541
Um...

300
00:12:04,561 --> 00:12:06,560
I need to find a hooker.

301
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:07,939
And not a street-walker.

302
00:12:07,976 --> 00:12:09,728
Uh, she's, uh, higher class than that.

303
00:12:09,765 --> 00:12:11,932
I, uh, met her at a hotel bar

304
00:12:11,969 --> 00:12:15,704
and, uh, spent some,
uh, time with her on Saturday,

305
00:12:15,741 --> 00:12:18,810
and, uh, I'd like
to take her out tonight

306
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:21,447
on a date for, uh, Valentine's Day.

307
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:26,276
So you walked into a police station

308
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,025
to find a prostitute?

309
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:29,424
Well, yeah.

310
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,071
You guys have, like,
binders full of them right?

311
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:32,762
I figure I can just
page through the girls

312
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,284
till I spot her.
Yeah, uh,

313
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,387
I'm sorry, sir.

314
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,522
The LAPD is not a referral
service for prostitutes.

315
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,869
Okay, uh, you're standing
in the way of true love.

316
00:12:41,096 --> 00:12:43,397
And that's a burden
I will have to bear.

317
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:46,809
Next.

318
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:48,532
Indecent exposure?!

319
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:51,158
Her husband was chasing me.
What was I supposed to do?

320
00:12:51,213 --> 00:12:53,049
Not sleep with his wife?

321
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:57,595
Hey, what happened?

322
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,793
I barely got into my opening
statement with Judge Bollard.

323
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,079
He kept interrupting me.

324
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,814
Words were exchanged.
He held me in contempt.

325
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:06,925
I'll take him off your hands
and book him.

326
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:08,635
Fine by me.

327
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:10,814
Ooh, I recently had a dream like this.

328
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:13,361
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.

329
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:15,924
I'm, uh... I'm gonna go get a snack.

330
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:18,347
All right, counselor.

331
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,782
I'm gonna need you
to empty your pockets.

332
00:13:19,872 --> 00:13:21,838
Uh-huh.
And take off your tie

333
00:13:21,892 --> 00:13:23,908
and your shoes and socks.

334
00:13:23,994 --> 00:13:25,468
Do it nice and slow for me.

335
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,394
You're enjoying this way too much.

336
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,785
Uh-huh.

337
00:13:28,822 --> 00:13:31,189
So what exactly did you say
to piss off the judge?

338
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,096
I was listing cases

339
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,433
of extreme use of force
by law enforcement...

340
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,199
trying to set precedent.
Mm, let me guess...

341
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:38,527
he ruled those cases were immaterial.

342
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:40,216
Over and over. It was relevant.

343
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:41,715
By the time my client got to booking,

344
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:43,852
his arm was broken.
Was he resisting arrest?

345
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:45,705
Even if he was,
that doesn't give you permission

346
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,158
to hurt him like that.

347
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:49,202
Give<i> me</i> permission?

348
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:52,386
No, I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.

349
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:54,630
Hey!

350
00:13:54,665 --> 00:13:56,455
I changed my mind. You book this guy.

351
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:58,466
I got work to do.
Angela, I didn't mean that.

352
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:04,564
Let's go.
Okay.

353
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:07,142
Look, I don't want
to talk about it, either,

354
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:08,643
but it's part of my recovery.

355
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:10,064
Can't you just admit

356
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:11,411
all your sins to your therapist?

357
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:13,369
I already have.

358
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:15,049
The whole point is to make amends

359
00:14:15,086 --> 00:14:16,152
with the people that I've hurt.

360
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,830
And I hurt you most of all.

361
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,255
And telling me about all
the horrible things you did

362
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,491
is gonna make it better?

363
00:14:23,642 --> 00:14:26,181
No... But only through honesty

364
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:28,510
can you learn to trust me again.

365
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,844
Isabel, you...
you didn't do those things

366
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:33,468
because you're a bad person.

367
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,869
You did them because
you're a drug addict.

368
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:38,455
And addicts lie, they cheat, steal.

369
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:39,791
They betray everyone around them.

370
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:42,064
It's hard-wired into their DNA.

371
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:46,150
So, are you saying you
can never trust me again?

372
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:48,322
Because I'll<i> always</i> be an addict.

373
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,602
No.

374
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,174
I'm saying that you hurt me
because of the drugs.

375
00:14:52,211 --> 00:14:54,023
And you won't hurt me now
because you're clean.

376
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,424
You can't know that.
Sure I can.

377
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:57,556
If you want to tell me

378
00:14:57,593 --> 00:14:59,715
how you put our IRA
into your arm after you left

379
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:01,312
or how you robbed the neighbors
when it ran out,

380
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:02,846
go right ahead.
Things are always

381
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:04,531
so black and white with you. It's...

382
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:06,275
Comforting?
Maddening.

383
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:07,978
Look, when we got married,

384
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:11,025
I felt this huge weight
to live up to your standards.

385
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:14,030
I never asked you to.
You didn't have to.

386
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,324
I didn't want to disappoint you.

387
00:15:19,828 --> 00:15:21,660
And all I ever did was fail.

388
00:15:26,612 --> 00:15:30,004
Hi... Is Officer Nolan around?

389
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,603
Oh, yeah, I think I just saw him.

390
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:35,511
Sorry, you are?
I am a very grateful citizen.

391
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:37,513
Oh.
He saved my life this morning.

392
00:15:37,673 --> 00:15:39,221
Oh!

393
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:40,785
Okay.

394
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,800
<i>Officer Nolan,
report to the front desk.</i>

395
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:56,398
Do you know him?

396
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:58,071
Yeah, a bit.

397
00:15:58,236 --> 00:15:59,735
He seems like a lovely man.

398
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:02,136
He's okay.

399
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:05,674
He saved my life.

400
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:07,139
Yeah, you said.

401
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:09,843
Oh, hey! What are you doing here?

402
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,119
You should be at home in bed.

403
00:16:11,157 --> 00:16:12,344
I'm on my way home.

404
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:14,846
The hospital gave me
a clean bill of health...

405
00:16:14,883 --> 00:16:16,017
Ah.
...thanks to you.

406
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:17,352
Oh, good.
Yeah.

407
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:19,020
Just some superficial burns.

408
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:20,388
Ooh.
Yeah.

409
00:16:20,423 --> 00:16:22,079
These are for you.
Wow.

410
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:24,524
That is, uh, extremely kind,

411
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:26,735
very thoughtful,
and entirely unnecessary.

412
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:29,839
Um, but now you should really
get home and get some rest.

413
00:16:29,998 --> 00:16:33,024
Well, maybe you can stop by
later and check in on me.

414
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:39,240
I, um... I do have a, um, long shift

415
00:16:39,276 --> 00:16:41,063
that I really should
be getting back to.

416
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,900
But, again, thank you so much.

417
00:16:42,937 --> 00:16:44,203
This is really nice, and I'm j...

418
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,520
I'm just so glad that you're all right,

419
00:16:45,557 --> 00:16:47,305
and, uh, thank you.

420
00:16:47,368 --> 00:16:49,184
That's...

421
00:16:49,297 --> 00:16:51,008
Yeah.

422
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,063
Well, thank you. Thank you for...

423
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,180
Yeah, thank you.

424
00:16:58,108 --> 00:16:59,774
She seems nice.

425
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:02,743
Uh, yeah, I saved her life.

426
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,214
She said.

427
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:06,966
Don't forget your muffins.

428
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,188
Right.

429
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:14,841
Heavier than they look.

430
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:22,538
Excuse me. You have an assault victim.

431
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:23,922
We're here to take his statement.

432
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,829
Room 524... back and to the left.

433
00:17:25,946 --> 00:17:27,438
Thank you.
Have I, um, seen you

434
00:17:27,475 --> 00:17:29,141
hiking at Runyon Canyon?

435
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:30,756
Quite possibly.

436
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,534
But I don't remember seeing<i> you.</i>

437
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:35,127
I mean, I look different
out of uniform.

438
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,547
Yeah.

439
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,383
I bet you do.

440
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,266
Come on.

441
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:42,321
What?

442
00:17:47,062 --> 00:17:48,956
Good afternoon, sir. I'm Officer Lopez.

443
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:50,610
This is Officer West.

444
00:17:50,645 --> 00:17:52,159
We understand you were attacked.

445
00:17:53,814 --> 00:17:55,314
That's what they keep telling me.

446
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,316
Doctor said your memory's
a little fuzzy.

447
00:17:57,462 --> 00:18:00,151
Is that the kind way
of bringing up my dementia?

448
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:03,594
No. Uh, that's not what I meant.

449
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:05,457
You were hit on the head
when you were attacked.

450
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:08,326
Doctor said you might
have a concussion.

451
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,328
Lucky me.

452
00:18:10,446 --> 00:18:13,164
I get dementia <i>and</i> a concussion.

453
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,166
Can you tell us what you do remember?

454
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:17,454
No, not really. No.

455
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:20,438
I know I was downtown.
Don't remember why.

456
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:22,632
Uh...

457
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,541
there was this guy running.

458
00:18:25,654 --> 00:18:28,421
He slammed into me and
he knocked me down, and I...

459
00:18:29,383 --> 00:18:31,683
...think he hit me, too.

460
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:33,172
I have these bruises.

461
00:18:33,209 --> 00:18:34,685
Did you get a look at him?

462
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,992
Whether I did or not, I don't remember.

463
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:41,692
I'm so sorry.

464
00:18:42,032 --> 00:18:44,194
I wish I could be more helpful.

465
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,001
Thank you.

466
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,188
Hey, do you know if Mr. Scott's
got anyone coming by to see him?

467
00:18:55,266 --> 00:18:57,040
Um, I couldn't find anyone to call.

468
00:18:57,075 --> 00:18:59,081
According to his primary doctor,
he lives alone.

469
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:00,477
No immediate family.

470
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:03,672
I can do a records search
for extended family.

471
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:05,749
What? I feel bad for him.

472
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:07,954
That's nothing to apologize for.

473
00:19:08,094 --> 00:19:10,579
I'll write down his full name
and date of birth for you.

474
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:13,024
Thank you.

475
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:15,723
<i>7-Adam-15, 459 in progress.</i>

476
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,329
<i>Female locked in bathroom.</i>

477
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:19,033
<i>States intruder is in her home.</i>

478
00:19:21,753 --> 00:19:22,933
Control, we are on scene.

479
00:19:22,968 --> 00:19:24,734
Please tell homeowner
to remain in the bathroom.

480
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:45,547
Clear.
Clear.

481
00:19:46,715 --> 00:19:49,415
Police.

482
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,426
Did a sweep of the house.
There's no one here.

483
00:19:51,493 --> 00:19:52,954
It's safe to come out.

484
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,298
Officer Nolan?

485
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,357
Have you come to my rescue again?

486
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,361
It's against the law,
to call in a false 911 report.

487
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:15,072
It wasn't false.
I heard someone in the house.

488
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:16,337
And you just happened to report it

489
00:20:16,374 --> 00:20:17,788
when we were the closest unit?

490
00:20:18,077 --> 00:20:19,820
What are you accusing me of?

491
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,782
I bet if I check your phone,
I'll find a police scanner app.

492
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:24,947
You waited until you heard
we were in your neighborhood

493
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:26,084
to place your 911 call.

494
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:27,487
How am I doing?

495
00:20:31,016 --> 00:20:33,016
Can I talk to her for a minute?

496
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,687
One minute.

497
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,267
Is that your husband?

498
00:20:46,452 --> 00:20:48,306
Yes.

499
00:20:48,671 --> 00:20:50,108
Killed in action?

500
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:53,344
Just over a year ago.

501
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:56,695
And I've been in a daze ever since.

502
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:01,319
Until today...

503
00:21:01,643 --> 00:21:04,088
until you saved my life.

504
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:06,357
I feel reborn.

505
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:10,028
Like... Like you've lifted
a cloud off of me.

506
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:11,996
It has to mean something.

507
00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:14,373
That's just adrenaline.

508
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:16,278
You had a near-death experience.

509
00:21:16,315 --> 00:21:17,868
It's not about me.

510
00:21:21,368 --> 00:21:23,602
I'm flattered for the attention.

511
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,893
I am.

512
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:27,964
But I am not interested.

513
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,786
Okay?

514
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:36,428
Okay.

515
00:21:40,637 --> 00:21:42,182
Take care of yourself.

516
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:46,698
I spoke to the court clerk.

517
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:48,675
The judge is still
not ready to let you go.

518
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:50,440
You must have really pissed him off.

519
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:53,370
Yeah, I seem to have
that effect on people.

520
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:55,405
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

521
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:57,151
I get a little carried away sometimes,

522
00:21:57,188 --> 00:21:58,479
but I know you're a good cop.

523
00:21:58,516 --> 00:22:00,026
Most of us are.

524
00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:02,658
Agreed.

525
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:07,274
You get out early enough, I'll
let you take me out to dinner.

526
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:09,417
I don't need anything fancy.

527
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,154
Uh...

528
00:22:12,237 --> 00:22:14,354
you know, I already made plans.

529
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:17,394
I thought I couldn't see you, but, um,

530
00:22:17,776 --> 00:22:19,562
I could cancel.

531
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:22,300
No, it's... it's not a big deal.

532
00:22:23,006 --> 00:22:24,503
I gotta get back out there.

533
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:25,950
Okay.

534
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,106
You haven't said a word for an hour.

535
00:23:05,142 --> 00:23:06,772
You're allowed to be angry with me.

536
00:23:06,836 --> 00:23:08,002
You're supposed to be.

537
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:09,520
I deserve it.

538
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:11,912
I don't want to be angry.

539
00:23:14,677 --> 00:23:17,566
I just want my wife back.

540
00:23:18,838 --> 00:23:20,804
But I can't have that.

541
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:24,944
You know, for the last year,

542
00:23:24,981 --> 00:23:28,350
everyone's told me
to just give up on you.

543
00:23:29,802 --> 00:23:31,634
To let you go 'cause you were...

544
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,419
you were gone anyway.

545
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:37,373
But I couldn't do it.

546
00:23:38,387 --> 00:23:39,437
I couldn't do it, I mean,

547
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:40,584
what kind of husband would I be

548
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:42,662
if I left you when you were lost?

549
00:23:47,394 --> 00:23:49,494
But you're not lost anymore.

550
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:53,662
And I will always be a reminder
of your lowest point...

551
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,217
of that shame you felt

552
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:56,655
when you put that needle in your arm.

553
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:01,795
So, as...

554
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,553
So, as long as we're together,

555
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,557
you're never gonna be able
to move forward.

556
00:24:16,215 --> 00:24:17,615
This is the end.

557
00:24:30,704 --> 00:24:33,705
Look, I should, uh...
I should get on the road.

558
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:36,178
Okay.
But, uh...

559
00:24:37,154 --> 00:24:38,962
you're doing great here.

560
00:24:50,676 --> 00:24:51,946
Hey, um...

561
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:54,850
Yeah?
Thank you.

562
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:56,914
For what?

563
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:01,315
For never giving up on me.

564
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,690
Yeah.

565
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,076
Ready to go?

566
00:25:17,113 --> 00:25:19,039
Yeah. Just looking for a next of kin

567
00:25:19,076 --> 00:25:20,553
for Mr. Scott.

568
00:25:20,618 --> 00:25:22,842
Guy led quite a life.

569
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,147
Lived all over

570
00:25:24,184 --> 00:25:26,569
but was an only child.

571
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,724
Never married.

572
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:31,667
You okay?

573
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:33,763
Yeah.

574
00:25:34,655 --> 00:25:36,287
Good thing I didn't get him a gift.

575
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:38,860
Who? Wesley? Why?

576
00:25:38,897 --> 00:25:41,459
I think I misread our relationship.

577
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:43,717
Hey, just the two I was looking for.

578
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:45,867
So, something weird
came up in connection

579
00:25:45,904 --> 00:25:47,955
to the dispatch call that
I sent you on earlier...

580
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:51,032
The old guy who was attacked?
What about him?

581
00:25:51,068 --> 00:25:53,483
Well, I was compiling a list
of the day's dispatches...

582
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,584
totally not my favorite part of
the job, by the way...

583
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:58,522
and something just popped out at me.

584
00:25:58,592 --> 00:26:00,041
There was an attempted abduction

585
00:26:00,077 --> 00:26:02,319
right by where your
attack victim was found.

586
00:26:02,358 --> 00:26:03,711
The woman fought off her attacker,

587
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:05,147
and the guy just fled.

588
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,210
Could be that's who
slammed into Mr. Scott.

589
00:26:07,347 --> 00:26:09,381
Did the woman leave
a description of the guy?

590
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:11,631
She just said he was
Caucasian male, strong.

591
00:26:12,459 --> 00:26:14,553
Thanks, Nell.
Sure.

592
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:17,241
And our only other potential
witness has dementia,

593
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:18,678
can't remember what
the guy looked like.

594
00:26:18,714 --> 00:26:20,147
Let's go try and jog his memory.

595
00:26:25,692 --> 00:26:28,045
Hey. What are you,
uh, doing out of bed?

596
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:30,570
I need to go home.
My mother made dinner.

597
00:26:30,606 --> 00:26:32,553
Sir, do you know where you are?

598
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,186
Yeah. Yeah. I'm in the hospital.

599
00:26:34,223 --> 00:26:35,811
I just had my appendix out.

600
00:26:35,978 --> 00:26:37,779
I'm guessing that was a long time ago.

601
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:39,826
Okay, let's get you back in bed.

602
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:43,373
Hey, uh, can you help us?
Sure.

603
00:26:43,673 --> 00:26:45,918
Mr. Scott, you need to get back in bed.

604
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:48,217
Doctor's orders, okay?
Oh.

605
00:26:49,242 --> 00:26:50,537
Okay.

606
00:26:51,475 --> 00:26:53,093
Here you go.

607
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,963
Uh, do we need to come back?

608
00:26:56,155 --> 00:26:57,614
Oh, no. No.

609
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:59,418
He's okay. Aren't you, Mr. Scott?

610
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:00,794
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

611
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:01,902
Thank you.
Thank you.

612
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:03,071
No worries.

613
00:27:04,713 --> 00:27:06,879
I'm Officer Lopez.
Do you remember me from earlier?

614
00:27:07,381 --> 00:27:09,045
Uh-huh, I think so.

615
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:11,600
You're in the hospital
because you were assaulted.

616
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,451
Uh, right, right, right, right, right.

617
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:16,455
Yeah, that's why my head hurts?

618
00:27:16,585 --> 00:27:18,151
Exactly.
We, uh, think the person

619
00:27:18,186 --> 00:27:20,670
who assaulted you attacked
someone else beforehand.

620
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:22,654
That you were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

621
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:25,092
Do you remember being
assaulted earlier today?

622
00:27:25,994 --> 00:27:27,326
Yeah.

623
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:29,490
I remember being knocked down.
And... And...

624
00:27:29,527 --> 00:27:30,975
And I think he hit me, too, 'cause I...

625
00:27:31,012 --> 00:27:32,265
Yeah, you said that.

626
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,667
Is there, um, anything else
you can tell us about him?

627
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:38,934
He was tall.

628
00:27:39,553 --> 00:27:41,216
He was white.

629
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:47,201
Um, his hair was long, I think.

630
00:27:55,532 --> 00:27:56,899
I'm sorry. That's all I got.

631
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:57,990
It's okay.

632
00:27:58,025 --> 00:27:59,904
That's more than we had before.

633
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:01,553
Try and get some rest.

634
00:28:01,697 --> 00:28:03,161
Is she all right?

635
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:05,334
The woman he attacked?

636
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,076
From what I hear, yes.

637
00:28:10,037 --> 00:28:13,138
That's good. That's good.

638
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:20,770
Son of a bitch.
What?

639
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,162
He asked if<i> she</i> was all right,

640
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:25,389
but you never said the other
victim was a woman.

641
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:26,897
He's the one who attacked her.

642
00:28:31,574 --> 00:28:34,740
He's got dementia. It was
diagnosed three years ago.

643
00:28:34,835 --> 00:28:37,029
Doesn't mean he couldn't have
tried to abduct that woman.

644
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:38,625
He hits his head as he's escaping.

645
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:40,321
Someone finds him disoriented,

646
00:28:40,358 --> 00:28:41,990
takes him to the hospital.

647
00:28:42,194 --> 00:28:44,266
And he's too out of it to object.

648
00:28:44,303 --> 00:28:45,561
Just has to play along.

649
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,958
Makes up a story
about getting attacked.

650
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:48,608
Or maybe he really did forget about it,

651
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:50,811
and he's just trying to fill in
the blanks in his memory.

652
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:53,998
All right, so what do we do?

653
00:28:54,529 --> 00:28:56,759
I'm going back to the station
to mobilize Major Crimes.

654
00:28:56,796 --> 00:28:58,100
They'll get a warrant for his DNA

655
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,769
and check it against
the woman who was attacked.

656
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:02,115
You stay here and make sure
he doesn't go anywhere.

657
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,732
Do you really think
he could've done it?

658
00:29:04,975 --> 00:29:07,068
I mean, he seems so lost.

659
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:09,103
Getting sick doesn't make you a saint.

660
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:19,834
Hey, ready?
I guess so.

661
00:29:19,904 --> 00:29:21,415
Don't act so excited.

662
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:24,032
Do you think it's weird
that we're the only ones

663
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:25,673
going to your
anti-Valentine's Day thing?

664
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,264
It's only as weird as we let it be.

665
00:29:27,335 --> 00:29:29,015
Besides, I'm sure other people
will meet us there.

666
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:31,137
Ah! Officer Lopez,
have you reconsidered

667
00:29:31,173 --> 00:29:32,375
about joining us this evening?

668
00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:33,920
No chance. We're still working a case.

669
00:29:33,967 --> 00:29:35,375
Which means Jackson won't be there.

670
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:38,108
It's going to be fun. Not weird. Fun.

671
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:39,560
Who are the flowers for?

672
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:41,664
Oh, they came in for Talia.
From who?

673
00:29:41,701 --> 00:29:42,859
None of your business.
None of your business.

674
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:44,842
That's none of my business.
Should I go find her?

675
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,261
No, I'll do it.

676
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,295
Fun.

677
00:29:51,468 --> 00:29:52,928
These came for you.

678
00:29:55,115 --> 00:29:56,990
Okay, thanks.

679
00:29:57,818 --> 00:29:59,989
They look expensive.

680
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,469
What's your point?

681
00:30:02,628 --> 00:30:04,149
I thought you broke things
off with him.

682
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:07,340
It's complicated.

683
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:09,287
He went back to his wife?

684
00:30:10,568 --> 00:30:12,000
Yes.

685
00:30:12,037 --> 00:30:14,374
Then it's simple.
He's married, not separated.

686
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:15,878
And you're done.

687
00:30:19,253 --> 00:30:20,719
Officer Lopez,

688
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,787
detectives looked into
your hospital Vic.

689
00:30:22,824 --> 00:30:24,648
Am I right about him
trying to abduct that woman?

690
00:30:24,944 --> 00:30:26,225
It's much bigger than that.

691
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:27,601
When they looked into his background,

692
00:30:27,637 --> 00:30:29,038
they got hits on several attacks

693
00:30:29,108 --> 00:30:31,296
on similar women
spanning over three decades.

694
00:30:31,404 --> 00:30:33,764
Over a dozen unsolved cases,
some of them homicides.

695
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:35,367
I think you may have found
a serial killer.

696
00:30:35,608 --> 00:30:37,100
Was the dementia just a cover?

697
00:30:37,147 --> 00:30:38,373
Not necessarily.

698
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,296
He went dormant after
his first diagnosis.

699
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,538
So what? He, like, forgot he liked

700
00:30:41,575 --> 00:30:42,992
to kill women?
I don't know.

701
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:44,844
It's possible today was
a "good memory" day...

702
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:46,411
where he got his taste back.

703
00:30:46,873 --> 00:30:48,514
FBI is sending somebody from Quantico.

704
00:30:48,873 --> 00:30:50,586
Major Crimes is sending
a mobilizing team

705
00:30:50,623 --> 00:30:51,850
to question him tonight.

706
00:30:51,885 --> 00:30:53,196
You sure you got him squared away?

707
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:54,867
Yes, Officer West is with him.

708
00:30:54,904 --> 00:30:56,561
Go make sure.

709
00:31:20,873 --> 00:31:23,414
Ooh.
Oh.

710
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:25,951
Sorry. Oh, thanks.

711
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,425
Mr. Scott? Kevin?

712
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:46,363
Aah!

713
00:31:46,483 --> 00:31:47,764
It's not twisting.

714
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:48,961
Just put it... put it on the corner.

715
00:31:48,997 --> 00:31:50,493
Right?
Yeah, and then you grind it.

716
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,654
Knu... Knuckle in?
Yeah.

717
00:31:51,691 --> 00:31:53,912
I thought you were gonna
invite a bunch of people.

718
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:56,615
I did. They could still come.

719
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:59,412
Well... I found a date.

720
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:01,319
I met her at the store
where I went to buy the wine.

721
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:03,122
You were gone 20 minutes.
I know.

722
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,093
Apparently I still got it.

723
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:07,358
Ooh! That might just be her.

724
00:32:07,538 --> 00:32:09,570
Coming!

725
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:12,181
Looks very nice. Okay.

726
00:32:12,217 --> 00:32:13,750
Hmm.
See what we have here.

727
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:15,786
Knowing him, it's going
to be very expensive.

728
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:17,779
Hey, guys.

729
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,428
I want you to meet Denise.

730
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,271
Oh, my God.

731
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,670
What a small world.

732
00:32:34,985 --> 00:32:37,725
All right, Mr. Scott,
it's time for your...

733
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:41,490
You too.

734
00:32:43,272 --> 00:32:45,498
She's crazy.
She's in pain

735
00:32:45,535 --> 00:32:47,669
and trying to cope with
the loss of her husband.

736
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:49,807
By stalking you?
It's a cry for help.

737
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:52,467
Hey. She seems nice, right?

738
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:54,834
Yeah, um, so here's the thing.

739
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,612
She's actually just
using you to get to me

740
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:58,263
because I saved her life earlier,

741
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,832
and now she's transferring the feelings

742
00:32:59,869 --> 00:33:02,326
she had for her late husband onto me.

743
00:33:03,268 --> 00:33:04,834
Okay.

744
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:07,990
Then you might not want her
wandering around your house.

745
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,521
I really don't. I should go find her.

746
00:33:30,094 --> 00:33:31,226
Where's Kevin?!

747
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:33,920
I don't know.

748
00:33:33,964 --> 00:33:35,319
Are you okay?

749
00:33:36,358 --> 00:33:37,862
He has my weapon.

750
00:33:38,602 --> 00:33:39,951
Stay here and make sure he's all right.

751
00:33:40,002 --> 00:33:42,135
7-Adam-07, officer attacked
at Shaw Memorial,

752
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:43,865
suspect is dressed
in green scrubs, armed,

753
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,340
send backup.

754
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:51,381
Kevin!

755
00:33:51,451 --> 00:33:52,918
Stop! Police!

756
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:55,459
Stop! Freeze!

757
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:26,209
Stop resisting.

758
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,975
It's over. You're under arrest.

759
00:34:29,596 --> 00:34:31,063
Denise, I...

760
00:34:32,755 --> 00:34:34,254
My hero.

761
00:34:35,457 --> 00:34:37,350
Denise, this is...

762
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,412
We need to talk.

763
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:41,514
I know what you're gonna say.

764
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:45,341
You're already in love
with somebody else.

765
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:47,067
I-I'm not.

766
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,662
Please.

767
00:34:48,764 --> 00:34:51,764
I saw you two talking on the deck.

768
00:34:51,973 --> 00:34:53,529
It's so apparent.

769
00:34:53,631 --> 00:34:54,779
Yeah, that's not...

770
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:56,308
I just wish you'd look at me

771
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:58,141
the way you look at her.

772
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,781
Look, Denise, I-I know you're
going through a hard time,

773
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:06,017
and I'm so sorry, but honestly,

774
00:35:06,054 --> 00:35:07,873
y-y-you have to believe me.

775
00:35:07,953 --> 00:35:10,404
I'm not the answer to your problems.

776
00:35:10,992 --> 00:35:12,694
I know that now.

777
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:14,444
Okay, good.

778
00:35:14,533 --> 00:35:16,666
Let's just get you dressed,

779
00:35:16,703 --> 00:35:18,469
and I'll get you a car home.

780
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,800
No.

781
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:31,404
Okay. Yeah.
Know what? Hey, hey!

782
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:32,679
We need to make her throw up.

783
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,123
Poison Control said not to do that.

784
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,541
There's a greater chance she
could choke on her own vomit.

785
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:36,975
Well, let's put her in the shower!

786
00:35:37,011 --> 00:35:38,210
They said sudden change in temperature

787
00:35:38,246 --> 00:35:39,623
could send her into a state of shock.

788
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,133
Why's everything I learned wrong?

789
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,346
Okay, thank you.

790
00:35:42,383 --> 00:35:43,849
They said we just need
to keep her alert.

791
00:35:43,886 --> 00:35:45,311
Ambulance is on the way. Hey!

792
00:35:45,348 --> 00:35:47,084
Hey, Denise.

793
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,186
Need you to stay with us, okay?

794
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:51,014
Denise.

795
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:55,294
Hey, I need you with us, okay?

796
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:57,229
You're gonna stay with us, all right?

797
00:35:57,637 --> 00:35:59,053
Hey.

798
00:36:01,934 --> 00:36:03,400
Paul.

799
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,694
You were supposed to come home.

800
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:12,061
You promised me you'd come home.

801
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:16,949
What am I supposed to do without you?

802
00:36:20,436 --> 00:36:23,021
You fight. He'd want you to fight.

803
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,740
Come on.

804
00:36:24,777 --> 00:36:26,686
Right here, right here.
One, two, three.

805
00:36:26,725 --> 00:36:28,126
Come on. Okay.

806
00:36:28,591 --> 00:36:30,323
All right.

807
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:35,667
I should really go with her.

808
00:36:37,002 --> 00:36:38,869
Have you learned nothing?

809
00:36:39,052 --> 00:36:41,453
Going to the hospital
with your suicidal stalker

810
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,522
is definitely <i>not</i> a good idea.

811
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,226
She's alone.

812
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:49,503
I'll go with her.

813
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:51,125
I just hope you see the irony

814
00:36:51,162 --> 00:36:53,150
of me spending Valentine's Day
with<i> your</i> stalker.

815
00:36:53,326 --> 00:36:54,508
I owe you.

816
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,889
Yeah, you do.

817
00:37:00,756 --> 00:37:02,078
Oh, what are you doing here?

818
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:04,061
I thought you were off today.

819
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,256
I was. I just, uh...

820
00:37:06,678 --> 00:37:08,633
I needed to take my mind off
some personal stuff,

821
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,370
so I figured a stack of
paperwork would do the trick.

822
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:14,539
Well, I was gonna head over to Nolan's.

823
00:37:14,574 --> 00:37:17,865
He's having, like,
an anti-Valentine's Day thing.

824
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:20,284
Um, maybe I'll see you there?

825
00:37:20,413 --> 00:37:23,214
No. No, I'm not feeling very social.

826
00:37:26,393 --> 00:37:27,733
Tim.

827
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,194
Are you okay?
Yeah.

828
00:37:38,491 --> 00:37:39,677
Nell?

829
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,165
Yeah?

830
00:37:42,435 --> 00:37:46,084
Look, I have no right to ask this,

831
00:37:46,321 --> 00:37:49,561
but I really don't want
to do paperwork right now.

832
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:52,772
And the thought of going back
to my empty house

833
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:55,476
is unbearable, so...

834
00:37:57,157 --> 00:37:59,490
...if you'd be up
for a totally platonic

835
00:37:59,618 --> 00:38:01,085
Valentine's Day drink...

836
00:38:02,934 --> 00:38:04,400
...I could use a friend.

837
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:08,525
I can be that.

838
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:11,742
Thanks.

839
00:38:14,633 --> 00:38:16,850
Judge says you can go.
About time.

840
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:20,285
You should still be able to make
your date with Melanie.

841
00:38:22,441 --> 00:38:24,240
How exactly did you know about that?

842
00:38:25,778 --> 00:38:27,444
Ah. Let me guess.

843
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,819
You performed an illegal search
of my phone.

844
00:38:30,469 --> 00:38:33,281
I did it as a civilian,
not in conjunction with a case,

845
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:35,131
so it's not an illegal search.

846
00:38:35,218 --> 00:38:37,452
Does that make it better?

847
00:38:37,707 --> 00:38:39,139
No.

848
00:38:39,324 --> 00:38:41,091
Melanie is my stepmom.

849
00:38:41,467 --> 00:38:42,929
My dad died last year.

850
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:44,177
She was gonna be alone,

851
00:38:44,214 --> 00:38:45,461
so I'm taking her out to dinner.

852
00:38:47,162 --> 00:38:48,686
Oh.

853
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:51,333
I really screwed that up, didn't I?

854
00:38:51,368 --> 00:38:52,602
Yep.

855
00:38:58,087 --> 00:38:59,553
Hey.
Hey!

856
00:38:59,608 --> 00:39:02,758
Hey, uh, I just wanted to stop by

857
00:39:02,795 --> 00:39:04,999
and see if you were doing okay.
Oh, I'm fine.

858
00:39:05,036 --> 00:39:06,367
They wanted to send me home, but...

859
00:39:06,404 --> 00:39:07,905
they don't know how thick my skull is.

860
00:39:07,942 --> 00:39:09,374
Um...

861
00:39:09,487 --> 00:39:11,420
do you have time to grab a bite?

862
00:39:11,623 --> 00:39:14,092
Uh, I get a break in 15 minutes.

863
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:15,788
But the food here is terrible, so...

864
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,319
Oh, well, that's why I brought takeout.

865
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,711
Yeah, I'm an Ova-Lacto Vegetarian

866
00:39:21,748 --> 00:39:23,332
with an immune-mediated response

867
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:26,194
to nuts, soy, and wheat, so...

868
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:29,270
Of course.

869
00:39:29,305 --> 00:39:31,014
I'm just messing with you.
I eat everything.

870
00:39:31,051 --> 00:39:34,052
I'm like a goat.
A goat? That's...

871
00:39:34,526 --> 00:39:35,992
I'd say you're just...

872
00:39:36,029 --> 00:39:37,612
just a little bit better looking.

873
00:39:38,491 --> 00:39:39,790
You think I look good now.

874
00:39:39,827 --> 00:39:40,960
Wait till you see me when I get out

875
00:39:40,997 --> 00:39:42,503
from under these fluorescents.

876
00:39:42,687 --> 00:39:44,795
So it's a date?

877
00:39:45,046 --> 00:39:46,858
Oh, it's happening.

878
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:49,397
Whether it's a date or not
depends on how it goes.

879
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,225
And what's this?

880
00:40:02,385 --> 00:40:04,758
Oh, you know it's gonna take
more than a little bar fight

881
00:40:04,795 --> 00:40:06,397
to torpedo our Valentine's Day.

882
00:40:06,557 --> 00:40:08,824
I love you.
I know.

883
00:40:09,967 --> 00:40:12,719
So, did you give any more thought

884
00:40:12,756 --> 00:40:14,967
to what we talked about last night?

885
00:40:15,224 --> 00:40:17,592
You can take your full
pension in six months.

886
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:21,245
We could travel the world.
We can make up for lost time.

887
00:40:21,584 --> 00:40:23,948
Doesn't that sound nice?

888
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:25,561
Yeah, look.

889
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,537
I'm not ready to be done here just yet.

890
00:40:32,303 --> 00:40:34,292
Okay.

891
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,615
But I'm not gonna
stop talking about it.

892
00:40:36,745 --> 00:40:38,177
Of course.

893
00:40:41,805 --> 00:40:43,171
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

894
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:44,655
Okay. Sit down.

895
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:47,535
I hope she's okay.

896
00:40:47,826 --> 00:40:49,412
Me, too.

897
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:52,977
I have to say, your, uh,
first solo Valentine's Day

898
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:54,397
was quite the adventure.

899
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,069
That's an understatement.

900
00:40:58,257 --> 00:40:59,990
Can I confess something?

901
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:01,618
Of course.

902
00:41:01,928 --> 00:41:03,453
It made me feel good.

903
00:41:03,654 --> 00:41:05,131
That she was into me.

904
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:07,516
You know, ob-obviously
before I realized

905
00:41:07,553 --> 00:41:09,192
she was not doing well.

906
00:41:09,311 --> 00:41:10,774
And I would've never have acted on it.

907
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:14,584
Just sometimes, though...
especially today...

908
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:17,288
you just want someone
to tell you that you're pretty.

909
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:18,899
Does that sound stupid?

910
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,102
No.

911
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:21,826
It sounds human.

912
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:25,272
Where the hell is everybody?!

913
00:41:25,743 --> 00:41:28,110
Uh, long story.

914
00:41:28,147 --> 00:41:29,326
I thought you had plans.

915
00:41:29,412 --> 00:41:30,717
I canceled them.

916
00:41:30,776 --> 00:41:32,343
Great! Come in.

917
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,467
Uh, Talia, this is Ben.

918
00:41:34,554 --> 00:41:36,721
Ben, this is Talia Bishop, my T.O.

919
00:41:36,756 --> 00:41:37,990
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

920
00:41:38,057 --> 00:41:39,631
John sings your praises
almost every day.

921
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:41,268
Really?
I don't know about every day.

922
00:41:41,305 --> 00:41:42,842
I might've said a few nice
things about you.

923
00:41:42,879 --> 00:41:44,178
Mm-hmm.
Can I get you a drink?

924
00:41:44,215 --> 00:41:45,815
There's plenty of food
if you're hungry.

925
00:41:45,932 --> 00:41:48,400
Can you make a martini? Extra dirty?

926
00:41:48,437 --> 00:41:49,819
Can I ever.

927
00:41:49,865 --> 00:41:51,522
So you two went to college together?

928
00:41:51,566 --> 00:41:52,931
That's right. We were roommates.

929
00:41:52,992 --> 00:41:54,952
So that means you have
a lot of embarrassing stories

930
00:41:54,988 --> 00:41:56,727
about Officer Nolan here.
Yes, I do.

931
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,124
I don't like

932
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,165
the direction this just took.

933
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:01,754
So picture this...

934
00:42:02,094 --> 00:42:03,287
Junior year.

935
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:06,561
John is going through
his hair metal phase.

936
00:42:06,931 --> 00:42:08,330
Hey.
