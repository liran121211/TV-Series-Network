1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,839
We made it!

2
00:00:03,977 --> 00:00:06,083
Say "honeymoon day one."

3
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:09,742
Honeymoon day one!

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,157
Are you taking a picture?

5
00:00:11,295 --> 00:00:12,469
Video.

6
00:00:12,607 --> 00:00:14,057
I wanted to see how long
until you broke.

7
00:00:14,195 --> 00:00:15,403
Hi. I'm Rafael.

8
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:17,094
- Hello!
- That's my daughter, Elise.

9
00:00:17,232 --> 00:00:18,613
Elise, hi, I'm John.
That's Bailey.

10
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:19,993
- Hello!
- Hi.

11
00:00:20,132 --> 00:00:21,650
And we run
the Oceanside Dreams.

12
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,583
I know that you booked
our luxury villa.

13
00:00:23,721 --> 00:00:24,860
- Yeah.
- Yes.

14
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:26,069
So let's get you
in there, yeah?

15
00:00:26,207 --> 00:00:27,346
Oh, I like
the sound of luxury.

16
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,624
You did say, villa, right?

17
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:31,281
Yes. Yes, sir.

18
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:33,766
We're still recovering
from the last few hurricanes.

19
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:35,664
The power goes out sometimes.

20
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:39,496
The internet works sometimes.

21
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:42,809
But to us,
this is still paradise.

22
00:00:42,947 --> 00:00:44,121
Totally.

23
00:00:44,259 --> 00:00:46,606
It's just that the pictures
on the website,

24
00:00:46,744 --> 00:00:48,125
they look a little different.

25
00:00:48,263 --> 00:00:49,954
Yes, exactly.

26
00:00:50,093 --> 00:00:52,716
We used AI
to generate renderings.

27
00:00:52,854 --> 00:00:55,477
So those are photos of
what the place feels like,

28
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:57,272
yeah, according to the AI.

29
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,654
That's what separates us
from the other resorts.

30
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:00,896
The false advertising?

31
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,830
What was that?

32
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:05,763
Oh, um...

33
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:08,594
possums, most likely.

34
00:01:08,732 --> 00:01:10,458
They are loud.

35
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:12,287
But rest assured,
if you hear anything at all,

36
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:15,808
it's either a mating sound
or a killing sound.

37
00:01:15,946 --> 00:01:17,948
Happy honeymoon.

38
00:01:18,086 --> 00:01:21,296
OK.

39
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:22,297
That's good.

40
00:01:22,435 --> 00:01:23,643
No, this is gonna be great.

41
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:25,335
- Mm-hmm.
- This is--

42
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:27,371
I am so sorry.

43
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,511
<i>♪ I'm gonna win for you ♪</i>

44
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:33,066
<i>♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪</i>

45
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:39,280
Hey, did you get any sleep?

46
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:41,972
I will sleep
when I pass this exam.

47
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,249
Yeah.

48
00:01:43,387 --> 00:01:44,802
I don't think
you're gonna sleep more

49
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,183
after you make detective.

50
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:47,495
How's it going?

51
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,807
I feel pretty good
about my knowledge.

52
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:51,878
I mean, the written
portion was easy.

53
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:54,778
But the oral exam
is what is literally

54
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,366
keeping me up at night.

55
00:01:56,504 --> 00:01:58,782
I mean, the test
is so subjective.

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,164
If even one person on the panel
has it against me,

57
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:02,510
I mean, it's over.

58
00:02:02,648 --> 00:02:04,063
And you think Lieutenant
Primm still hates you?

59
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:05,513
I brought him
homemade cookies,

60
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:06,721
and he threw them in the trash.

61
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,930
OK. You can't control Primm.

62
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,519
You can only control you.

63
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:12,968
And now it's time for you

64
00:02:13,106 --> 00:02:14,211
to step away
from the highlighter.

65
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:15,764
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

66
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,559
That's exactly right, though.
See?

67
00:02:17,697 --> 00:02:21,011
Because I can only control me,
so I just need to be perfect.

68
00:02:21,149 --> 00:02:22,357
You can over-prepare.

69
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:24,808
No, that is an idea
that lazy people created.

70
00:02:24,946 --> 00:02:26,534
No, I've seen it happen, OK?

71
00:02:26,672 --> 00:02:28,329
You get in your own head.

72
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:32,505
You just need to trust yourself
and then let it go.

73
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,475
Yeah, I don't think
I can do that.

74
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:37,890
All right.

75
00:02:38,028 --> 00:02:39,167
I'm gonna take a shower.

76
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:40,375
Right now?

77
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:42,066
Yeah.

78
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,723
Well--

79
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:47,865
Hmm, maybe
I could take a break.

80
00:02:51,144 --> 00:02:52,594
It was a wedding, you know.

81
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:56,564
Everything was all romantic--
music, soft light--

82
00:02:56,702 --> 00:03:00,740
and I kind of...

83
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:02,535
kissed Celina.

84
00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:04,813
Celina, who you work with?

85
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:07,264
Celina, who saved your life
when you were shot?

86
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:09,093
That Celina?
- Yeah.

87
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,130
Did I mention the light?

88
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:12,787
Because I really believe,
like, the mood lighting

89
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:14,202
was 20% responsible.

90
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,272
How did she react?

91
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,825
Not good.

92
00:03:16,963 --> 00:03:19,069
Yeah, the look she gave me was
somewhere between horrified

93
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:22,072
and really horrified.

94
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,970
She doesn't share
your feelings?

95
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:28,803
I'm not sure I share
my feelings, you know.

96
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,944
We've been so close,
and she was the only person

97
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:33,394
I could talk to.
- Look.

98
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:35,292
It's very natural to
confuse that kind of bond

99
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,604
with something romantic.

100
00:03:36,742 --> 00:03:38,468
OK. So--so what do I do?

101
00:03:38,606 --> 00:03:39,917
How do I fix this?

102
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:42,920
You and Celina have been
through a lot together.

103
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:44,508
You have a shared trauma.

104
00:03:44,646 --> 00:03:45,820
And as tempting as it is

105
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,753
to want everything fixed
overnight,

106
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:50,376
that's not how
these things work.

107
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,136
Now, when you say trauma,
are you talking

108
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,656
about Celina rejecting me
or me getting shot?

109
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:58,833
Because they have been equally
traumatizing in my eyes.

110
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:00,766
You're both adults.

111
00:04:00,904 --> 00:04:02,388
Clear the air.

112
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:05,011
Set some healthy boundaries
and give her time.

113
00:04:05,149 --> 00:04:07,290
OK.

114
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:13,296
Are we starting an OnlyFans?

115
00:04:13,434 --> 00:04:15,712
I thought we would
want to remember

116
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,989
this honeymoon forever.

117
00:04:17,127 --> 00:04:19,474
Now of course, I'm not so sure.

118
00:04:19,612 --> 00:04:21,200
Is this a button cam?

119
00:04:21,338 --> 00:04:22,201
Mm-hmm.

120
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,547
- A drone?
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:25,584
Are we launching
an intelligence agency?

122
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:30,416
It came as a package,
and it was on sale.

123
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:32,832
And I got excited.

124
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,075
Can I show you?

125
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:36,215
This one is waterproof.

126
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:38,976
It makes it perfect
for swimming, kayaking.

127
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:41,254
Or we can do that thing where
we go cage diving with sharks.

128
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:42,808
We can't.
They don't have it here.

129
00:04:42,946 --> 00:04:44,119
- Oh.
- I made sure.

130
00:04:44,257 --> 00:04:47,157
This one attaches right to us.

131
00:04:47,295 --> 00:04:49,884
So when we go zip lining
and you're zipping on past

132
00:04:50,022 --> 00:04:51,713
and I'm watching
from the ground,

133
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,198
we can cut into it later from
all sorts of different angles.

134
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:57,201
OK, and this one is
a button camera in case

135
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,651
we have to go undercover,

136
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:00,860
break up any monkey
drug cartels.

137
00:05:00,998 --> 00:05:02,414
And what about this one?

138
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,381
Oh, why is it so dark?

139
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,038
Hang on a second.

140
00:05:06,176 --> 00:05:07,591
Night vision.
- No.

141
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:08,799
- Yes.
- No.

142
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:10,387
Totally.
Just listen.

143
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:11,733
Listen.

144
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:14,357
I was thinking we can take
one of these, set it up,

145
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:16,186
you know, outside.

146
00:05:16,324 --> 00:05:17,843
See what the possums are doing.

147
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:19,465
Oh, yeah, totally,
that's what you were thinking.

148
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:20,535
It is what I was thinking.

149
00:05:20,673 --> 00:05:21,743
What were you thinking?

150
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:22,882
I think you know
what I was thinking.

151
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,850
- Hey, I'm married.

152
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:30,856
Celina, hi!

153
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:32,892
Aaron.

154
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,929
Are you cleared
for active duty?

155
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,724
No, uh, not yet.

156
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:39,451
Soon.

157
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,281
I, um--
I got something for you.

158
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:43,420
Picked it up
on the way to work.

159
00:05:43,558 --> 00:05:45,595
Oh.
No, you didn't have to do that.

160
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:47,459
Surprise. New laptop.

161
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:51,324
Aaron, that's
completely unnecessary.

162
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:54,431
Yeah, but you were saying
how your computer was slow.

163
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:56,088
I know what you're doing.

164
00:05:56,226 --> 00:06:00,195
You're trying
to apologize for the--

165
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,267
for the kiss,
but you don't have to.

166
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:04,614
OK?

167
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:06,547
OK.

168
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:10,723
Yeah.

169
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,002
Anybody want a laptop?

170
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,625
Yeah. Yeah, I'll take it!

171
00:06:15,763 --> 00:06:18,282
The murder scene exception
is the misbelief

172
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,940
that when a crime scene
is so heinous,

173
00:06:21,078 --> 00:06:23,149
you are allowed to go
around the search warrant.

174
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:25,324
Correct again.
Next question.

175
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:27,740
What is my favorite
leisure activity?

176
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:29,259
Um, excuse me?

177
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:31,986
You know, am I more
of an outdoor or indoor cat?

178
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:35,921
Smitty, please just read
from the cards I gave you, OK?

179
00:06:36,059 --> 00:06:37,440
Look, you asked me
for my advice.

180
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:38,441
I did not!

181
00:06:38,579 --> 00:06:39,683
And my advice is,

182
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,202
you should do
a little research on Primm.

183
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,481
Find out his likes,
his dislikes, favorite hobbies.

184
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:46,449
Then you can take
that knowledge

185
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:49,210
and score some bonus points.

186
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:52,455
I'm worried that
I focused too much on Aaron

187
00:06:52,593 --> 00:06:55,527
after the attack
and did you a disservice,

188
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,563
let you fall
through the cracks.

189
00:06:57,701 --> 00:06:58,875
Oh, thank you, sir,

190
00:06:59,013 --> 00:07:00,946
but I'm fine.

191
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,467
What about the wedding?

192
00:07:04,605 --> 00:07:05,709
You went rogue.

193
00:07:05,847 --> 00:07:08,056
You know better
than to meet with a CI

194
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,989
without alerting
other officers.

195
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:11,301
I do.
I just thought that--

196
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,303
It would impress me?

197
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:15,547
Yes.

198
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,858
Well, it didn't.

199
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:19,033
That situation could
have ended a lot worse.

200
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:21,380
Don't ever do it again.
- Yes, ma'am.

201
00:07:21,518 --> 00:07:23,520
Harper is needed
back with the detectives.

202
00:07:23,658 --> 00:07:25,867
He'll be riding with Sergeant
Bradford until Nolan returns.

203
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:27,559
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

204
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,492
Get the war bags, Boot.
Set up the shop.

205
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,530
He's a major dog guy.

206
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:35,083
He goes to the shelter
every weekend

207
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,602
looking for new ones to foster.

208
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,639
And he won't stop
until he sets them up

209
00:07:38,777 --> 00:07:40,295
with their forever homes.

210
00:07:40,433 --> 00:07:42,090
Wait, what--
that is beautiful.

211
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,540
I am also a dog lover.

212
00:07:43,678 --> 00:07:44,921
What's going on here?

213
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:46,888
I'm helping Chen study
for her detective's exam.

214
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,234
Smitty.

215
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:49,546
What happened
to not over-preparing?

216
00:07:49,684 --> 00:07:51,721
It's Smitty.
Is it even really helping?

217
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:52,894
What?

218
00:07:53,032 --> 00:07:54,378
I just need a few minutes.

219
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:56,415
No, you need to take a break.

220
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:57,865
I got Celina today.

221
00:07:58,003 --> 00:07:59,280
Come on. You're riding with us.

222
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:00,592
Oh!

223
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,076
Well, that actually sounds
kind of fun.

224
00:08:02,214 --> 00:08:03,974
The second you two start
talking about birth charts,

225
00:08:04,112 --> 00:08:05,389
I'm kicking you both
out of the car.

226
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:07,460
OK.
Thank you, Smitty, thank you.

227
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,809
I've done all I can do.

228
00:08:10,947 --> 00:08:12,880
The rest is up to her.

229
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,607
Right.

230
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,194
Elise was right.

231
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:19,783
This place is beautiful!

232
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:22,579
And all we really need
is each other, you know?

233
00:08:22,717 --> 00:08:24,236
Oh! Unbelievable.

234
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:25,617
What?

235
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,446
Oh, I'm just checking
the possum camera, man.

236
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:28,896
They were really going at it.

237
00:08:29,034 --> 00:08:30,794
Fighting or... you know?

238
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:32,244
I thought we were
the only ones staying

239
00:08:32,382 --> 00:08:33,625
on this end of the island.

240
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,145
Uh, maybe he got here
after us?

241
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,526
He looks introspective.

242
00:08:38,664 --> 00:08:40,217
He looks like a vampire

243
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:41,805
trying to avoid sunlight
at all costs.

244
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:42,806
Oh.

245
00:08:42,944 --> 00:08:43,807
- Oh.
- Oh.

246
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:44,808
Oh!

247
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:46,914
I wasn't expecting that.

248
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:48,950
Just because you brought
all the cameras

249
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:50,987
doesn't mean you can use them
all the time.

250
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,436
You're totally right.

251
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:53,679
Be in the moment.

252
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,301
No, it's--I can hear
what you're saying.

253
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:56,302
Oh.

254
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,132
Wait a second.

255
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,616
Update.

256
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:01,445
He is not a vampire.

257
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:04,828
He is eating... avocado toast?

258
00:09:04,966 --> 00:09:07,037
So who do you think he is?

259
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:11,524
Uh, I'm gonna go with
billionaire playboy

260
00:09:11,663 --> 00:09:13,388
faking his own death,
went under the knife

261
00:09:13,526 --> 00:09:15,218
to change his features
to start a new life

262
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:16,633
with a secret second family.

263
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:19,325
Billionaire?
But he chose to stay here.

264
00:09:19,463 --> 00:09:21,500
Oh. Yeah, maybe he's lost.

265
00:09:21,638 --> 00:09:23,882
I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no, no, wait.

266
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,677
What if he just wants
to be left alone?

267
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,817
Or even worse, he doesn't
want to be left alone,

268
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:30,164
and then we have a third wheel
for the rest of our honeymoon.

269
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:32,856
I just want
to get a read on him.

270
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:34,099
And don't worry,
I'll make it sound

271
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:35,859
like we're old and no fun.

272
00:09:35,997 --> 00:09:38,690
By the time I'm done, he won't
want to be anywhere near us.

273
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,312
OK.

274
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,797
You can make us sound
a little fun.

275
00:09:42,935 --> 00:09:44,143
"Hi, I'm John Nolan.

276
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:48,492
That over there is
my stunning wife, Bailey."

277
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,873
"Oh!

278
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:51,772
Wow, yes,
she is really beautiful."

279
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,394
"Yeah, she is.

280
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:55,810
"Did I also mention
she's talented and smart

281
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:57,536
and funny and--"

282
00:09:57,674 --> 00:09:58,537
"That's so amazing.

283
00:09:58,675 --> 00:10:00,090
You're so lucky, dude."

284
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:02,437
I made sure my radio
batteries are charged up.

285
00:10:02,575 --> 00:10:04,819
And I have a spare one here
too because you never know.

286
00:10:04,957 --> 00:10:06,856
I threw an extra case
of water in the back, so--

287
00:10:06,994 --> 00:10:08,064
Juarez.

288
00:10:08,202 --> 00:10:10,169
I'll stop.

289
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:12,793
Hey, what's going on
with you and Aaron?

290
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:14,035
Nothing. Why?

291
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:15,209
Well, I saw you guys
in the parking lot,

292
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:17,314
and it looked awkward.

293
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:19,213
Huh, I don't know.

294
00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:22,630
OK, just a little.
I just--whoa, whoa, whoa.

295
00:10:22,768 --> 00:10:24,770
- Both of you, out now.
- Whoa.

296
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:25,944
You said no birth charts.

297
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:27,808
You didn't say we couldn't
talk about boys.

298
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:29,810
That goes without saying.

299
00:10:29,948 --> 00:10:31,397
We will talk at lunch.

300
00:10:31,535 --> 00:10:33,365
<i>Seven-Metro-one hundred,
I have a four-eighty-four</i>

301
00:10:33,503 --> 00:10:35,643
<i>in progress at Bellevue
& East Kensington.</i>

302
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:37,576
Show us responding.

303
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:47,344
I've got this.

304
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:48,621
Sir!

305
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,658
I need you to stop right there.

306
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:53,212
Oh, is--is something
going on with--

307
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,214
Oh, we got a report
of someone shoplifting

308
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:56,940
at this location.

309
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:58,148
Wasn't me.

310
00:10:58,286 --> 00:11:00,288
Well, can you raise
your arms for me?

311
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:07,123
I'm sorry.

312
00:11:07,261 --> 00:11:10,160
I just--my arm really hurt,

313
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:11,955
and I don't have any money.

314
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:13,543
OK, we need to get you
to the hospital.

315
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:15,407
What's your name?

316
00:11:15,545 --> 00:11:16,960
I don't know.

317
00:11:17,098 --> 00:11:18,893
Well, it says here
your name is Jonathan Knight,

318
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:20,723
and you work
for Trusted Security.

319
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:22,897
Is that my name?

320
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:24,140
Jonathan Knight.

321
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:25,313
OK, drop the act.

322
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,349
Lying about your name
isn't gonna

323
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:27,626
keep us from arresting you.

324
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:29,421
Cuff him.
- No! No, no, no, no.

325
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,216
I--I woke up,
and I was just bleeding!

326
00:11:31,354 --> 00:11:33,149
And I saw
the convenience store.

327
00:11:33,287 --> 00:11:36,808
I--I don't remember
anything from before that.

328
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,741
All righty, let's go.

329
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,433
Is that plaster dust?

330
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:43,159
I--I don't know.

331
00:11:45,264 --> 00:11:46,887
Are you buying any of this?

332
00:11:47,025 --> 00:11:48,578
Not a word.

333
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,304
I mean, the gash in his arm
is real enough.

334
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:52,927
- Oh!

335
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:56,724
I don't feel that good.

336
00:11:56,862 --> 00:11:58,105
No, it's OK. It's OK.

337
00:11:58,243 --> 00:11:59,865
We're gonna--we're gonna
take you to the hospital.

338
00:12:00,003 --> 00:12:00,970
No, no.

339
00:12:01,108 --> 00:12:02,419
Pukester is going
in an ambulance,

340
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:03,766
and you're going with him.

341
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,736
Can we talk about
that guy from breakfast?

342
00:12:08,874 --> 00:12:11,256
I mean, that was weird.

343
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:13,706
When I asked him his name,
it took him a full five seconds

344
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:15,156
to tell me it was Dean.

345
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:16,468
It's probably
'cause he's on pain meds.

346
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:19,264
Any kind of facial surgery
is quite serious.

347
00:12:19,402 --> 00:12:20,644
I don't know.

348
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,577
Told me a wonky story
about a dog attack.

349
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:24,994
Something about it
just doesn't smell right.

350
00:12:25,132 --> 00:12:27,962
Can you turn your cop brain
off for just a few hours

351
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,308
so we can go kayaking?

352
00:12:29,446 --> 00:12:30,516
Of course I can.

353
00:12:30,654 --> 00:12:32,795
Let me just land
this little beauty.

354
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:33,830
Oh.

355
00:12:33,968 --> 00:12:35,142
- Don't be alarmed.
- Careful.

356
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,315
Lands with the touch
of a button.

357
00:12:36,453 --> 00:12:38,283
Hey--ooh.

358
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:40,803
And I'm sorry.

359
00:12:40,941 --> 00:12:43,564
Could you just state it
one more time for the record?

360
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:45,462
- You beat me.
- Uh-huh.

361
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,636
Which means?

362
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:49,501
Which means that I lost.

363
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,158
You really had
a staggering improvement.

364
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:53,332
If you ever wanted
a second career change,

365
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,747
you could be
a professional kayaker.

366
00:12:54,886 --> 00:12:55,783
Oh.

367
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:57,336
And what is the lesson here?

368
00:12:57,474 --> 00:12:58,821
That don't make everything

369
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,168
a contest unless
I'm sure I can win.

370
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:03,964
That's right.

371
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:05,724
Did we leave that open?

372
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:10,108
Maybe it was
like that before?

373
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:11,695
Yeah.

374
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,214
We were just too distracted

375
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:14,837
by the grandeur of this place
to notice?

376
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:18,426
What time is it?

377
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,877
It's 8:30.

378
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:23,017
Oh, perfect!

379
00:13:27,297 --> 00:13:28,264
OK.

380
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:29,990
Just a second to lie down.

381
00:13:30,128 --> 00:13:32,268
Then we'll grab some dinner.

382
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,082
Bailey and I had somewhat
of a stressful morning.

383
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,912
The camera I left on
last night recorded

384
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,226
someone standing outside
our window watching us sleep.

385
00:13:59,364 --> 00:14:01,642
- For almost an hour.
- Right.

386
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,956
So I have charged
all the cameras.

387
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,268
We are setting up
a small but very

388
00:14:07,406 --> 00:14:09,132
technologically advanced
perimeter.

389
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,790
Let's see if he wants
to come back.

390
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:14,758
Watch me sleep now.

391
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,105

It's on.

397
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:26,978
Are we being crazy?

398
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,084
Somebody watched us sleep
last night for an hour.

399
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:31,396
That's crazy.

400
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:34,330
Why can't we have,
like, a normal honeymoon?

401
00:14:34,468 --> 00:14:36,021
Tell you what, let's take
the first ferry out of here.

402
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,609
When we get home,
we're gonna book a trip

403
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,611
to the most normal place
we can find.

404
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:43,684
It's Elise.

405
00:14:43,822 --> 00:14:45,030
Coming!

406

00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:48,171

- Housekeeping.

00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:49,310
Come on in.

409
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:50,967
Brought you two
some fresh towels.

410
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:52,486
Thank you.

411
00:14:52,624 --> 00:14:54,971
Um, Elise, when is
the next ferry out of here?

412
00:14:55,109 --> 00:14:57,974
No ferry today
or tomorrow probably.

413
00:14:58,112 --> 00:15:00,528
It's about as reliable as
the internet and the power.

414
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,013
But I'm sure it'll be up
and running by the time

415
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,186
you guys check out.

416
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:04,532
What if there was a problem?

417
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,017
Is there a problem?

418
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,915
No, no. That's it.

419
00:15:08,053 --> 00:15:09,848
Thank you.

420
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:11,781
OK, let me know
if you need anything else.

421
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,058

00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:20,376
Well, we are stuck here
for a few more days.

425
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:22,688
So we might as well
make the most of it.

426
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:25,036
Shall we go for a swim?
- Sure, of course.

427
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,278
Yeah, let's make
the best of this.

428

00:15:30,006 --> 00:15:32,043
Hey, Luna.
How's the new job going?

432
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,665
Energizing, mostly.

433
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:35,770
Being a patient advocate
is rewarding.

434
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:38,152
Um, we're actually here
to check up on a patient

435
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,291
that we brought in yesterday.

436
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:40,292
He claimed to have amnesia.

437
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,604
Right.

438
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:43,192
The John Doe in 415.

439
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,159
I have called other hospitals,
homeless shelters,

440
00:15:45,297 --> 00:15:47,541
rehab facilities--
anything I can think of.

441
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,577
No one has reported him
missing.

442
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,683
Do the doctors think
he'll get his memory back?

443
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:52,925
Probably.

444
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:54,341
But brain injuries
can be tricky,

445
00:15:54,479 --> 00:15:55,790
so it could be a few months.

446
00:15:55,928 --> 00:15:56,826
OK. Thanks.

447
00:15:56,964 --> 00:15:58,862
We'll go talk to him.

448
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,037
Hey, how's Aaron?

449
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:02,970
He's fine, I think.

450
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:04,972
I--I don't know.

451
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,180
I sense trouble.

452
00:16:06,318 --> 00:16:07,733
No, no, not at all.

453
00:16:09,873 --> 00:16:11,392
OK, maybe a little.

454
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,222
He kissed me at the wedding
out of nowhere.

455
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,052
And now I'm...

456
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,122
Angry?

457
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,158
Yeah.

458
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:19,538
I think he was just confused.

459
00:16:19,676 --> 00:16:21,230
And I mean, the way I reacted,

460
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:22,576
it must have been
so embarrassing.

461
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:25,061
And I'm sure he wants to forget
it ever happened.

462
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,339
I'm hearing a lot about
what you think Aaron's feeling.

463
00:16:27,477 --> 00:16:30,722
But you can't know
until you talk it through.

464
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:35,554
- Hey.
- Mm.

465
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,316
Did you find something?

466
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:39,420
You know who I am?

467
00:16:39,558 --> 00:16:40,973
I'm afraid not.

468
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:42,561
Look, we contacted
Trusted Security.

469
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:43,976
They have never heard of you.

470
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:46,151
And we can't find
a Jonathan Knight

471
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:48,291
matching your description
in California.

472
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:51,950
Well, I have been
thinking about it.

473
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:55,540
And I think the only
rational answer is that...

474
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:57,231
I'm a spy.

475
00:16:57,956 --> 00:16:59,475
- Not my first guess.
- No.

476
00:16:59,613 --> 00:17:01,994
No, it makes sense.
It's a cover identity.

477
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,755
I was probably
infiltrating a high-rise

478
00:17:03,893 --> 00:17:05,446
full of government secrets.

479
00:17:05,584 --> 00:17:06,654
Maybe I got poisoned.

480
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,139
That's why I threw up.

481
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,348
You know, like radiation
poisoning or something?

482
00:17:10,486 --> 00:17:12,695
Yeah, you know,
let's not jump to conclusions.

483
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:16,181
You probably threw up
because you're concussed.

484
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,977
Korea. North Korea.

485
00:17:19,115 --> 00:17:20,875
Wait, it's all
coming back to me now.

486
00:17:21,013 --> 00:17:22,946
I--I was targeting North Korea.

487
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:26,433
And I had a partner,
and we were on a mission.

488
00:17:26,571 --> 00:17:27,917
Do you know where he is?

489
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:29,125
He could be in danger.

490
00:17:29,263 --> 00:17:30,471
We need to find him.

491
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:32,439
Um, do you know
your partner's name

492
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:34,372
or when you last saw him?

493
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:39,860
- No.
- Mm.

494
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,966
OK, we're on it.

495
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:44,761
We'll get back to you.

496
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:48,110
You turned off the TV?

497
00:17:48,248 --> 00:17:49,835
Any chance he's right?

498
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:51,251
We ran his prints.

499
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:52,424
If he worked
for a three-letter agency,

500
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:53,529
it would have set off alarms.

501
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,151
Yeah. I mean, maybe.

502
00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:57,636
But the way he talked about
his partner, that felt real.

503
00:17:57,774 --> 00:17:59,500
Maybe there's some
kernel of truth there.

504
00:17:59,638 --> 00:18:01,053
You saw the news.

505
00:18:01,192 --> 00:18:02,538
He's just repeating
the last thing he saw on TV.

506
00:18:02,676 --> 00:18:04,988
Maybe there's some
memory that's surfacing,

507
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,577
and he just can't make sense
of what it really means.

508
00:18:07,715 --> 00:18:08,854
Maybe.

509
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:10,132
Regardless, there's not
much we can do

510
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,443
until he starts
to remember more.

511
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:12,651
Mm.

512
00:18:18,657 --> 00:18:20,003
Excuse me.

513
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:22,144
Have you seen
Officers Bradford and Chen?

514
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:23,524
Mm-mm.

515
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:25,664
Then I'm in trouble.

516
00:18:25,802 --> 00:18:27,356
Look at this.

517
00:18:29,323 --> 00:18:31,670
There she is.

518
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:34,501
So nice.

519
00:18:34,639 --> 00:18:36,192
Oh.

520
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:39,885
Bailey!

521
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:44,096
Normal honeymoon!

522
00:18:44,235 --> 00:18:47,065
Just wanted a normal honeymoon.

523
00:18:48,066 --> 00:18:49,723
OK.

524
00:19:06,981 --> 00:19:08,673
OK.
This is John Nolan, LAPD.

525
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:10,847
With me is Bailey Nune, EMT.

526
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:13,747
We have just discovered
a dead body.

527
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:16,577
Uh, female, 30s, Martha--

528
00:19:16,715 --> 00:19:17,923
Oh, Delgado.

529
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:19,408
Her body is still stiff.

530
00:19:19,546 --> 00:19:20,926
She's been dead
for at least eight hours.

531
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:23,757
Wasn't in the water long enough
to sustain much damage.

532
00:19:23,895 --> 00:19:25,310
It's such a tragedy.

533
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:27,554
I gotta say, it's not as
uncommon as you might think.

534
00:19:27,692 --> 00:19:28,796
What do you mean?

535
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,764
Well, even people
who grew up here,

536
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:32,766
they sometimes
underestimate the undertow.

537
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:35,941
They have a few drinks,
they go for a night swim,

538
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:38,599
and then--then this happens.

539
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:40,083
Well, that may be.

540
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,395
But I'm sure you'll agree,

541
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:42,948
we do need to call
some professionals

542
00:19:43,086 --> 00:19:43,949
to determine
what really happened.

543
00:19:44,087 --> 00:19:45,399
Oh, of course.

544
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:47,263
I already called the constables
on the main island.

545
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:49,507
And they said they're gonna
get here as soon as they can.

546
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:50,784
It's usually just
a couple of days

547
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,613
with the accidental drowning.

548
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:54,788
But we'll put poor Martha here

549
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:57,480
in the walk-in fridge
until they arrive.

550
00:19:57,618 --> 00:19:59,137
Right.
Oh! I've got bars.

551
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:01,450
I've got a bar.
I'm gonna--would you?

552
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:03,314
There you go.

553
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:09,147
Why is Nolan FaceTiming me
from his honeymoon?

554
00:20:09,285 --> 00:20:11,460
Are you calling
to rub in how beautiful

555
00:20:11,598 --> 00:20:13,496
your island paradise is?

556
00:20:13,634 --> 00:20:14,566
<i>I wish.</i>

557
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:15,809
<i>Place is run down,</i>

558
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:17,328
<i>phone and internet
are very spotty,</i>

559
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,674
<i>there was a creeper
outside our window</i>

560
00:20:18,812 --> 00:20:19,813
<i>watching us sleep for an hour,</i>

561
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:21,332
<i>and now we found a body.</i>

562
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,333
A body?

563
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,748
<i>Yeah.</i>

564
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:25,750
<i>The housekeeper just
washed up on the beach.</i>

565
00:20:25,888 --> 00:20:27,821
<i>Something is wrong here,</i>

566
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:31,549
<i>and local law enforcement
is non-existent.</i>

567
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:33,792
<i>I'm worried somebody
maybe found out I was a cop</i>

568
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,105
<i>and is targeting--could you--</i>

569
00:20:36,243 --> 00:20:37,796
Nolan.

570
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:39,591
Seems like he needs
some backup.

571
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:41,800
Are you suggesting
a trip to the tropics?

572
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:43,940
I wasn't, but now I am.

573
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,114
Hm.

574
00:20:45,252 --> 00:20:49,187
Sergeant Grey,
we have a problem.

575
00:20:49,325 --> 00:20:50,982
Uh, Nolan just called.

576
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,087
They found a dead body
on the beach.

577
00:20:53,225 --> 00:20:55,642
Why do I feel like I should
be more surprised about that?

578
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,127
Yeah, he and Bailey are
basically trouble magnets.

579
00:20:58,265 --> 00:20:59,784
- Hmm.
- He doesn't have his gun.

580
00:20:59,922 --> 00:21:01,199
No backup.

581
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:02,407
And now he's in the middle
of an active crime scene.

582
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:03,926
We want to go down there.

583
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:05,755
To an island where
you have no jurisdiction?

584
00:21:05,893 --> 00:21:08,896
By the time you get the funds
approved to book the travel,

585
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:11,036
he'll be celebrating
his anniversary.

586
00:21:11,174 --> 00:21:12,279
I can put it
on Wesley's card,

587
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,901
which is also
technically my card.

588
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,558
He's always saying
we should take a vacation.

589
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:17,940
And then the department
can reimburse us.

590
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:20,908
You know they won't
cover first class.

591
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,807
But the trust fund does.

592
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:24,602
OK, seriously,

593
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,880
do you think
Nolan needs saving,

594
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:28,330
or are you just trying
to get out the office?

595
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:31,574
Who says two things
can't coexist?

596
00:21:37,684 --> 00:21:39,064
Hey! Hey!

597
00:21:39,202 --> 00:21:42,136
Uh, Celina,
can we talk after shift?

598
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:43,897
It's not fine.

599
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:45,174
Come again?

600
00:21:45,312 --> 00:21:47,832
I know I said
this morning that the--

601
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,212
that the kiss wasn't
a big deal.

602
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,422
But the truth is,
I still feel weird.

603
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,287
And I have to be OK with that.

604
00:21:55,426 --> 00:21:57,151
You need to be OK with that.

605
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:58,532
Yeah, of course.

606
00:22:00,396 --> 00:22:01,639
How?

607
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:05,850
I--I don't know.

608
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:08,404
I want us to get back
to normal too.

609
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:10,786
But it's--it's going
to take some time, OK?

610
00:22:10,924 --> 00:22:13,858
And it will be weird
until it isn't.

611
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:16,239
Boot!

612
00:22:18,414 --> 00:22:19,622
I'm about to hang
a bell around your neck,

613
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,796
'cause I keep losing you.

614
00:22:20,934 --> 00:22:22,280
You get that paperwork
all done?

615
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:23,454
Oh, yes, sir.

616
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,455
Is there anything else you need

617
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,559
before I end my shift?

618
00:22:25,697 --> 00:22:26,664
What do you think?

619
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:28,113
I--

620
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:29,356
You are all done.

621
00:22:29,494 --> 00:22:31,151
Clock out. Good work today.

622
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:32,394
Thank you.
Good night.

623
00:22:32,532 --> 00:22:34,672
Good night.

624
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,124
Would it kill you to give her
some acknowledgment?

625
00:22:39,262 --> 00:22:40,643
I'm trying to help her
become a good cop,

626
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,024
not boost her self-esteem.

627
00:22:42,162 --> 00:22:43,819
Yeah, but when
you're teaching someone,

628
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:45,476
it's important to tell them
what they're doing right

629
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,547
as well as what
they can improve upon.

630
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:49,238
Yeah, it sounds
like a good plan

631
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:50,757
if you're going for mediocre.

632
00:22:50,895 --> 00:22:52,759
Have I not
softened you at all?

633
00:22:52,897 --> 00:22:54,968
Is it weird that I'm nervous?

634
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:56,245
No, it's not weird.

635
00:22:56,383 --> 00:22:58,316
This is creepy.

636
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:02,493
Huh.

637
00:23:04,598 --> 00:23:05,806
Oh.

638
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:09,258
Does that sound like mating
or killing to you?

639
00:23:10,846 --> 00:23:12,226
Power is out.

640
00:23:12,364 --> 00:23:16,783
Fortunately, walk-in fridge
runs on a backup generator.

641
00:23:16,921 --> 00:23:17,784
Are you ready?

642
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:18,992
Part of me is

643
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,166
and a part of me
just feels sad.

644
00:23:21,304 --> 00:23:22,927
I hate seeing someone
kept like this.

645
00:23:23,065 --> 00:23:24,376
Same here.

646
00:23:24,515 --> 00:23:25,688
Best thing we can do for her
is trying to figure out

647
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:26,793
what really happened.

648
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:28,001
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

649
00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:29,796
Some cameras here.

650
00:23:31,418 --> 00:23:34,007
All right.
I am John Nolan, LAPD.

651
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:35,526
This is Bailey Nune, EMT.

652
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:40,669
We're doing an external autopsy
on Martha Delgado.

653
00:23:40,807 --> 00:23:42,429
We found her
in the water yesterday.

654
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,983
Time of death was estimated
eight hours prior.

655
00:23:45,121 --> 00:23:46,778
She's been in cold storage
for six hours,

656
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,471
giving us approximately
14 hours postmortem.

657
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:50,989
Her fingers look good.

658
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:52,681
Usually with some
sort of poisoning,

659
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:55,477
there's a color change
or white lines on the nails.

660
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:57,306
Not seeing any bruising.

661
00:23:57,444 --> 00:23:58,756
Oh.

662
00:23:58,894 --> 00:24:00,171
Hang on a sec.

663
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:04,140
Got a--it's a laceration
behind her left ear.

664
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,867
Did she hit her head
when she fell in the water

665
00:24:07,005 --> 00:24:09,387
or was she hit
and then fell in?

666
00:24:09,525 --> 00:24:11,734
No way to tell
without a proper autopsy.

667
00:24:11,872 --> 00:24:13,046
Let's go through her pockets,

668
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:14,047
see if there's
anything in there

669
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:15,324
that might fill in the blanks.

670
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:16,567
Oh.

671
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,809
John.

672
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:20,502
What is that?

673
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,641
A bandage claw.

674
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:22,814
Maybe she picked it up

675
00:24:22,952 --> 00:24:24,264
when cleaning Dean's room.

676
00:24:24,402 --> 00:24:26,956
And then took it for a swim
with all her clothes on?

677
00:24:27,094 --> 00:24:29,165
Do you think he killed her?

678
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:30,753
I don't know.

679
00:24:30,891 --> 00:24:32,997
But I am starting to think
we need to check out his cabin.

680
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:37,415
- Where's your hand?

681
00:24:37,553 --> 00:24:39,244
I'm right here.
It's so dark.

682
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,109
The lights are off.

683
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:43,248
Yeah,
and the power's out too.

684
00:24:43,386 --> 00:24:44,387
So that's no help.

685
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,079
You think he's in there?

686
00:24:47,494 --> 00:24:49,841
Only one way to find out.

687
00:24:49,979 --> 00:24:51,809
OK.

688
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:58,747
Empty. Let's go.

689
00:24:58,885 --> 00:25:00,024
OK.

690
00:25:03,061 --> 00:25:04,580
OK.

691
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:06,444
This guy travels light.

692
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:14,314
There.
- OK.

693
00:25:14,452 --> 00:25:15,557
Great.

694
00:25:17,524 --> 00:25:18,663
Oh, wait.

695
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:20,423
I found something. Here.

696
00:25:22,736 --> 00:25:24,566
What is this?

697
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:27,465
Oh.

698
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:29,398
That is not your average
hunting equipment.

699
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:32,297
OK, um...

700
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:33,644
there's no serial number.

701
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,577
- Let's take the ammo.
- What if he misses it?

702
00:25:35,715 --> 00:25:37,786
Well, better than
him using it.

703
00:25:37,924 --> 00:25:39,581
Wait, wait.

704
00:25:48,728 --> 00:25:50,799
I'm jamming the barrel.

705
00:25:50,937 --> 00:25:51,972
Here. That'll do it.

706
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,456
- Let's go.

707
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:54,492
It's him.

708
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,804
Back door.

709
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:00,463
Go, go, go.

710
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,880
What are you doing?
- The camera.

711
00:26:03,018 --> 00:26:04,122
Come on!

712
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,607
Let's go, let's go!

713
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:13,580
That was close.

714
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,206
OK.

715
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,725
He's still there.

716
00:26:20,863 --> 00:26:22,175
Maybe he's
calling it a night?

717
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:24,142
Or coming to try
to murder us.

718
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,144
The nearest island is
at least three hours away.

719
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:28,146
We could grab a kayak
and be there by sunrise.

720
00:26:28,284 --> 00:26:29,492
So we notify police.

721
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,701
They head over here,

722
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,668
arrest Dean before
he finishes breakfast.

723
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:35,395
What do you say?
Kayaking by moonlight?

724
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:37,190
- I'll race you there.
- Yeah.

725
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:39,433
So there's an issue
with our escape plan.

726
00:26:39,571 --> 00:26:42,471
I mean, this took work!

727
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:44,818
Must have done that while
we were examining the body.

728
00:26:44,956 --> 00:26:47,510
He knows we're onto him.

729
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:51,929
This has certainly been
a memorable honeymoon.

730
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:54,276
There's no one else I'd rather
spend it with than you.

731
00:26:54,414 --> 00:26:55,933
Oh, sweetie.

732
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,833
I mean, except
you may be better off

733
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:02,353
with Harper or Lopez.

734
00:27:02,491 --> 00:27:04,355
Or Tim or Lucy.

735
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:06,529
Right. Grey, Celina.

736
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:07,669
Aaron.

737
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:09,187
Heck,
I'd even accept Smitty

738
00:27:09,325 --> 00:27:11,189
right now
if he brought his gun.

739
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:19,611
That's Elise.
She looks bad.

740
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:20,923
I'm gonna go.
- No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

741
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:22,028
It's OK.
It's OK.

742
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:23,477
I will be right back.
- John, no!

743
00:27:23,615 --> 00:27:24,927
- I'll be right back.
- No.

744
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:26,722
Oh, my God.

745
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:36,732
Hey!

746
00:27:37,871 --> 00:27:39,114
- No--

747
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:46,397
John!

748
00:28:10,697 --> 00:28:12,354
What time is it?

749
00:28:14,908 --> 00:28:16,876
Oh, my God, it's so late.

750
00:28:17,014 --> 00:28:17,980
You needed to sleep.

751
00:28:18,118 --> 00:28:19,810
No, I should be studying.

752
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,294
Ah, take the morning off.

753
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:22,674
Don't you feel better?

754
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,954
You know, I do.

755
00:28:26,092 --> 00:28:27,265
Thank you.

756
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:33,824
Oh, my God.

757
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,618
My test is in 20 minutes!

758
00:28:35,757 --> 00:28:36,792
What? How?

759
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,587
They moved it up!

760
00:28:39,933 --> 00:28:41,590
No service. You?

761
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,144
Nope.

762
00:28:44,282 --> 00:28:45,628
Which means
we can't track their phones

763
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,907
or get an ETA on our backup.

764
00:28:48,045 --> 00:28:49,322
I don't like this.

765
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,358
Yeah, there is no one
around to greet you.

766
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,429
Or hear you scream.

767
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:58,607
That--that was just
an animal, right?

768
00:28:58,745 --> 00:29:00,402
Sure. But just in case.

769
00:29:09,963 --> 00:29:11,309
OK.

770
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:14,485
Um, hi, I'm Lucy Chen,

771
00:29:14,623 --> 00:29:16,314
and I'm here for
the detective's exam.

772
00:29:16,452 --> 00:29:17,626
- Chen.
- Mm-hmm.

773
00:29:17,764 --> 00:29:19,007
Right.

774
00:29:19,145 --> 00:29:21,181
Take a seat.

775
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:23,839
They'll be with you
in a few hours.

776
00:29:23,977 --> 00:29:26,566
Um--no, um, but I got
a text from them.

777
00:29:26,704 --> 00:29:28,533
They said that
they needed me right away.

778
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:30,259
What can I tell you?

779
00:29:30,397 --> 00:29:31,571
Over there.

780
00:29:31,709 --> 00:29:33,538
They'll get to you
when they get to you.

781
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:35,126
Hey. How's she doing?

782
00:29:35,264 --> 00:29:36,334
Celina or Lucy?

783
00:29:36,472 --> 00:29:37,404
Both.

784
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,854
Celina is making progress.

785
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:40,269
I think she's riding
with me again today.

786
00:29:40,407 --> 00:29:43,238
Lucy's in the test now
waiting her turn.

787
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:44,722
I'll be glad when this is done.

788
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,482
Hey, I did some research
on the security badge

789
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,829
our John Doe was wearing.

790
00:29:47,967 --> 00:29:50,210
The company patrols
dozens of businesses in LA.

791
00:29:50,348 --> 00:29:53,075
He kept talking about
North Korea, right?

792
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:54,697
Well, one
of the office buildings

793
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,768
is in Koreatown,
just a few blocks

794
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:57,873
from where we found him.

795
00:29:58,011 --> 00:29:59,426
Why the fake badge?

796
00:29:59,564 --> 00:30:02,498
The company has a diamond
exchange on the fourth floor.

797
00:30:02,636 --> 00:30:03,845
And you think
he was gonna rob it?

798
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:05,432
Exactly.
I think something went wrong.

799
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:07,331
He got injured
and lost his memory.

800
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:09,781
Not any better ideas.

801
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,266
Let's go check it out.

802
00:30:11,404 --> 00:30:13,682
Great work.

803
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,270
Let's go, Boot.

804
00:30:19,274 --> 00:30:20,862
Clear.

805
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:31,286
They put up cameras
all over the place.

806
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,770
All right.

807
00:30:32,908 --> 00:30:34,289
The last footage has to be
uploaded somewhere.

808
00:30:34,427 --> 00:30:36,739
Let's get this charged,
see what we can find.

809
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,715
All right, so which wall is
the diamond exchange behind?

810
00:30:46,853 --> 00:30:49,131
That one.

811
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:50,581
OK.

812
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:52,134
So it looks like
he tried to break

813
00:30:52,272 --> 00:30:54,757
into the diamond exchange
through a shared wall,

814
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:58,313
fell through the ceiling,
knocked himself out instead.

815
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:00,315
- Is someone there?

816
00:31:00,453 --> 00:31:01,523
Hello?

817
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:04,388
Hey, man, get me out of here!

818
00:31:04,526 --> 00:31:06,252
Police. Someone in there?

819
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,909
Help me. I'm stuck!

820
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:29,516
Thank God you found me.

821
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:31,311
I knew Roger wouldn't
leave me behind.

822
00:31:31,449 --> 00:31:32,623
I knew it.

823
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:35,315
I just wish you got here
five minutes earlier...

824
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:37,248
before I drank my own urine.

825
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:50,848
Officer Chen.

826
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:07,140
Good evening.

827
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:08,141
Thank you for--

828
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,867
It's been a long day,

829
00:32:10,005 --> 00:32:11,282
so let's just get right to it.

830
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,596
What would you do
if a member of the press

831
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:16,839
wanted access to a crime scene?

832
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:19,911
The press are allowed
closer access to a crime scene

833
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,465
than the general public.

834
00:32:21,603 --> 00:32:23,467
It is acceptable for the press
to enter a crime scene

835
00:32:23,605 --> 00:32:26,988
if and only if they are not
going to disturb the evidence

836
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:28,437
or endanger themselves.

837
00:32:28,575 --> 00:32:30,888
Let's talk about
the importance

838
00:32:31,026 --> 00:32:32,579
of not disturbing evidence.

839
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:36,894
Recently, you--you failed
to secure a crime scene.

840
00:32:39,448 --> 00:32:41,899
- I did.
- And?

841
00:32:42,037 --> 00:32:44,626
The sprinklers went off.

842
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:47,767
Critical evidence was
literally washed away.

843
00:32:47,905 --> 00:32:49,769
I recovered what I could,
and I worked with the DA

844
00:32:49,907 --> 00:32:51,805
to make the case
as strong as possible.

845
00:32:51,943 --> 00:32:53,531
It was my fault.

846
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:55,395
I accept
full responsibility for that.

847
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:57,535
But I made the most of it.

848
00:32:57,673 --> 00:33:00,952
It sounds like you're
almost glad you lost evidence.

849
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:03,024
Of course not.

850
00:33:03,162 --> 00:33:04,473
But I couldn't change it.

851
00:33:04,611 --> 00:33:07,200
And I didn't let it
knock me off my course.

852
00:33:07,338 --> 00:33:10,169
I tracked my suspect,
and I got a full confession.

853
00:33:12,378 --> 00:33:14,069
I learned a lot
from that mistake,

854
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:16,865
and I will never make it again.

855
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:37,230
Looks like there's
a few cabins in the east.

856
00:33:37,368 --> 00:33:39,577
All right. Here we go.

857
00:33:48,241 --> 00:33:50,209
Look what you did.

858
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:55,110
Yeah.

859
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:57,043
All right.
We gotta find them now.

860
00:33:57,181 --> 00:33:58,562
Which way is east?

861
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,081
Uh, that way.

862
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:01,944
Let's go.

863
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,294
I came here for peace
and quiet...

864
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:11,264
To heal.

865
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:22,172
And you screwed that up.

866
00:34:32,216 --> 00:34:34,115
I was finally gonna be
good-looking.

867
00:34:34,253 --> 00:34:39,120
And hot girls like you...

868
00:34:39,258 --> 00:34:41,467
were finally gonna look my way.

869
00:34:41,605 --> 00:34:43,952
And now they'll--
now they'll just run.

870
00:34:45,678 --> 00:34:47,024
True beauty is on the inside.

871
00:34:47,162 --> 00:34:49,337
Oh. [laughs] Good.

872
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:52,305
Then you won't mind me cutting
my way inside you to find it?

873
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:53,582
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

874
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:54,894
Look, focus on me.

875
00:34:55,032 --> 00:34:56,171
I'm the one who screwed
everything up for you.

876
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:57,552
It was me.
- Don't be jealous.

877
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:00,244
There's plenty of this
to go around, huh?

878
00:35:03,454 --> 00:35:04,938
You're a cop, aren't you?

879
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:06,216
Yes.

880
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,700
Yes, I am, LAPD.

881
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:10,289
But us being here has
nothing to do with you.

882
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:11,600
We're on our honeymoon.

883
00:35:11,738 --> 00:35:12,705
Right!

884
00:35:12,843 --> 00:35:14,327
It's a whole operation.

885
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:17,641
"It's a"--
Rafael and Elise work here.

886
00:35:17,779 --> 00:35:20,022
What, you--you thought
they were undercover?

887
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,024
- What do you know about me?
- Nothing.

888
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:23,509
And we wouldn't have
suspected anything

889
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:25,027
if you'd just left us alone!

890
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:39,180
You are a liar!

891
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:41,872
- Shut up!

892
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:45,255
Or you're gonna end up
as dead as your dad!

893
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:49,535
By the way, you were smart
to take my ammo,

894
00:35:49,673 --> 00:35:51,019
but you didn't hide it
very well.

895
00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:52,020
No!

896
00:35:53,711 --> 00:35:55,748
Gun.

897
00:36:22,395 --> 00:36:23,983
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

898
00:36:24,121 --> 00:36:25,122
I was so scared.

899
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,399
Get some towels
from the bathroom.

900
00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:27,469
I need to stop her bleeding.
- Right.

901
00:36:27,607 --> 00:36:29,747
- I got it.
- Yeah, yeah.

902
00:36:31,887 --> 00:36:33,820
It's gonna be OK.

903
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:36,651
What is--oh, my God.

904
00:36:36,789 --> 00:36:37,962
I believe that's yours.

905
00:36:40,379 --> 00:36:41,621
Who the hell is that?

906
00:36:41,759 --> 00:36:43,934
That's our backup, finally.

907
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,869
Looks like our honeymoon
ends with an airlift.

908
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:49,388
Thank God.

909
00:36:53,184 --> 00:36:54,358
You did good work
today, Boot.

910
00:36:54,496 --> 00:36:56,429
Paid attention to details,
thought outside the box.

911
00:36:56,567 --> 00:36:57,844
Thank you.

912
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,812
I couldn't have done it
without my training officer.

913
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:01,123
That's a good answer.

914
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,470
But day's not done yet.

915
00:37:02,608 --> 00:37:04,506
Right, right.

916
00:37:04,644 --> 00:37:06,543
But you know, this could be
a little more manageable

917
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:08,614
with the help from my TO.

918
00:37:08,752 --> 00:37:10,443
Don't mistake my compliment
for kindness.

919
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:12,273
Police work isn't
supposed to be manageable.

920
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:14,447
Good luck.
- Yes, sir.

921
00:37:15,724 --> 00:37:16,656
Ooh.

922
00:37:16,794 --> 00:37:18,106
- Hey.
- Hey.

923
00:37:18,244 --> 00:37:19,866
I heard a guy vomited on you,

924
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,317
and then you booked another guy
who drank his own urine?

925
00:37:22,455 --> 00:37:23,801
Yeah.

926
00:37:23,939 --> 00:37:26,217
You know, I bet you're missing
patrol right about now.

927
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:27,978
I think I can handle
a few more days

928
00:37:28,116 --> 00:37:31,671
without being covered
in a stranger's bodily fluids.

929
00:37:34,812 --> 00:37:37,159
Today feels less weird
than yesterday, doesn't it?

930
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:38,471
Yeah.

931
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:40,853
And maybe tomorrow
will feel even less weird.

932
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:42,303
That sounds about right.

933
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:44,512
Good, 'cause I--

934
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:46,686
I miss my friend.

935
00:37:46,824 --> 00:37:48,412
Me too.

936
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,484
Maybe we can laugh
about this sometime soon--

937
00:37:51,622 --> 00:37:54,211
not, like, today, but soon.

938
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,008
Good night, Celina.

939
00:37:58,146 --> 00:37:59,803
Good night.

940
00:38:03,703 --> 00:38:04,842
Hmm.

941
00:38:21,652 --> 00:38:23,827
Sarge, I'm gonna die
on this list.

942
00:38:26,174 --> 00:38:28,176
Sorry, Chen.

943
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,576
Well, well, well.

944
00:38:48,714 --> 00:38:52,096
The shortest vacation ever.

945
00:38:52,234 --> 00:38:54,961
You get an ID on Nolan
and Bailey's bad guy?

946
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,964
Yep, his real name is
Nicholas Colston.

947
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,070
He has been in the wind
since they found

948
00:39:00,208 --> 00:39:03,556
pieces of his girlfriend
all over his apartment.

949
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:04,799
He was hiding out
on the island

950
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:06,628
recovering from facial surgery,

951
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:08,492
and when he saw a cop
honeymooning next door,

952
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,907
he got paranoid.

953
00:39:10,045 --> 00:39:12,669
He thought his victims were
conducting surveillance.

954
00:39:12,807 --> 00:39:14,256
Glad you got there
when you did.

955
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:16,431
Well, local law says
that we might have to go

956
00:39:16,569 --> 00:39:19,054
back down to the island
to testify.

957
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:21,609
Yeah.
Week--maybe two, tops.

958
00:39:21,747 --> 00:39:22,748
Mm.

959
00:39:26,441 --> 00:39:27,580
Yeah.

960
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:31,584
That's funny.

961
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,281
I can't believe
I came in 17th.

962
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,008
It's almost worse
than coming in last.

963
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,631
Hey, look.

964
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:46,116
There is definitely no prize
for coming in last.

965
00:39:46,254 --> 00:39:51,570
But I'm pretty sure there's
a prize for coming in 17th.

966
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:52,881
Oh, my God.

967
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:55,677
Oh.

968
00:39:55,815 --> 00:39:57,645
I guess I'll just
have to set my sights

969
00:39:57,783 --> 00:40:01,545
on a different future,
like metro.

970
00:40:03,236 --> 00:40:05,100
I'm kidding.

971
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:06,447
I--I knew that.

972
00:40:06,585 --> 00:40:08,310
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

973
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:11,106
You really thought
I was gonna come in first?

974
00:40:11,244 --> 00:40:13,315
Of course I did.

00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:15,317
