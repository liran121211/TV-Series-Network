1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,426
Previously, on "the rookie"...

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,526
Who's this? I'll be there in 20.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,696
- What's going on?
- I got to go.

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,836
- Just wait.
- I can't.

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,356
I'll call you when I can.

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,566
What the hell are you into
that's making you so crazy?

7
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,086
- I can't tell you.
- Why?

8
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,256
Because even knowing
about it will put you

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,436
at risk with the department.

10
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,336
I have a group of friends at school,

11
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,846
and they're getting a place together.

12
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,026
And I was thinking of joining them.

13
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,616
- You're moving?
- Kinda.

14
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,276
You violated procedure and
roped in two other officers?

15
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,446
I'm required to notify
your Metro commander.

16
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,176
What she does with it is up to her.

17
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,626
Lucy, I've been lying
to myself for a long time.

18
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,386
I can't just go back
to the way things were.

19
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,736
Are you breaking up with me?

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,936
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,116
What's happening?

22
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,776
I think we should have a baby.

23
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,596
I haven't even had a cup of coffee yet.

24
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,116
Maybe we table this till later?

25
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,086
Having a kid has been
the greatest joy in my life,

26
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,466
so why would I want to deny her that?

27
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,136
It's all about temperature.

28
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,826
That is the best indicator
about whether or not

29
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,306
I'm ovulating... that and cervical mucus.

30
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,966
I did not know that.

31
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,456
Thank you for that tidbit and for the ride.

32
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,806
Hey, time is not on our side.

33
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,286
We need to get serious
about maximizing our chances.

34
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,326
Agreed. Yeah.

35
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:19,676
- You let me know when the...
- Cervical mucus.

36
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,576
Is optimal, and I will be there.

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,646
- Morning.
- Morning.

38
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,126
Hey, you got your coffee.

39
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,646
I was hoping we could stop
at revolution after roll call.

40
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:30,856
We still can.

41
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,136
I'm gonna need four
more shots, minimum.

42
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,306
Ooh, bad night of sleep?

43
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,166
No, just still trying to get pregnant.

44
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,616
Poor you.

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,136
Constant sex with your gorgeous wife?

46
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,826
You should take a
day off to take a break.

47
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,316
Ok. Fair enough.

48
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,696
But turns out, it's not quite as much fun

49
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,316
when she has you on a tight schedule.

50
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,626
Real tight.

51
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,156
What time are you
getting home at today?

52
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,466
I couldn't say.

53
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,506
I'm so far behind.

54
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,506
Speaking of, I got to go.

55
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,986
Bye.

56
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,126
And I'll be home at my usual time.

57
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,166
So somewhere between
6:00 and midnight?

58
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,856
That's the one.

59
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,516
Bye, honey. I love you.

60
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,446
Take good care of your sister.

61
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,006
What the hell is a gun
doing in your purse?

62
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,656
It's for protection.

63
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,176
I have a permit.

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,186
Not in my house, you don't.

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,736
Hello, mom. Are you free today?

66
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,326
Because I just fired my nanny.

67
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,496
How did I end up with so much stuff?

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,466
I used to live out of a backpack.

69
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,816
Hey, listen.

70
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,536
If you are overwhelmed,
you could always delay

71
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,926
by a few days or a few weeks.

72
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,196
Do you need me to stay?

73
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,066
I mean, I know you've
been going through a lot

74
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,476
with the breakup.

75
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,686
No, no, I... no.

76
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,896
I wasn't saying you should stay for me.

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,416
I... I was just

78
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,556
you know, if you're not
ready, then you have options.

79
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,216
Thanks, but I am ready.

80
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,836
Great.

81
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,046
I made a reservation at
that fancy Thai restaurant

82
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,216
for your going-away dinner.

83
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,706
7:00 tonight.

84
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,736
I'm not going away. I'm moving 3 miles.

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,676
Girl, I am going to shower you

86
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,326
with love at a fancy
dinner, and that is final.

87
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,506
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,926
Did Tim really get kicked out of Metro?

89
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,236
Yeah.

90
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,066
It just goes to show, it's all downhill

91
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,810
after the pinnacle of you.

92
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,636
First day back on patrol.

93
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,636
Yes, sir. Yeah.

94
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,156
Happy to be back.

95
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,636
I know I have a lot of work ahead of me.

96
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,916
And rebuilding our trust won't be easy,

97
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,956
but I'm ready to do the work.

98
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,436
That's good to hear.

99
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,816
First step, I need you to take
Dr. London on a ride-along.

100
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,136
I'm... I'm sorry.

101
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,406
You asked the department
shrink to babysit me?

102
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,756
Well, she's not there to babysit.

103
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,796
She's there to observe.

104
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,276
You mean evaluate.

105
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,486
Listen, sarge, with all due respect,

106
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,456
I know you're... you're
worried about me, but

107
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,176
within the last week, you've
been bounced back to patrol

108
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,496
for reckless behavior,

109
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,836
and you broke up with your girlfriend.

110
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,156
Both things make me
question your judgment.

111
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,396
Sir, breaking up with Lucy

112
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,016
has nothing to do with the ray situation.

113
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,636
Trust me.

114
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,816
Listen, Tim, if you really
want to regain my trust,

115
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,916
this is where it starts.

116
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,916
Now, I can make this an official thing

117
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,096
and assign you mandated counseling,

118
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,026
which will go on your
record, or you can entertain

119
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,306
Dr. London for the day,
and we see where we end up.

120
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,276
I'll... I'll take the ride-along.

121
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,316
That's what I thought.

122
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,866
If you get into any
trouble, I'll be on patrol, too.

123
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,866
I'm riding with chen.

124
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,176
Evaluating her?

125
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,866
No, just observing.

126
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,626
Right.

127
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,356
You still taking bets on the breakup?

128
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,666
You know it.

129
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,326
100 bucks says Tim cheated.

130
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,636
You sure?

131
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,806
- It's running 5 to 1 against.
- Yeah.

132
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,016
Bigger risk, bigger reward.

133
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,156
What are you doing?

134
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,816
Nothing.

135
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,546
I... I was never even here.

136
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,166
Are you taking bets
on my breakup, smitty?

137
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,446
No, I would nev.

138
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,486
"Lucy found out about Tim's secret child

139
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,346
"with Isabel, 5 to 1.

140
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,386
Lucy is sleeping with Aaron, 3 to 1."

141
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,356
How are the odds that
I'm cheating with Aaron,

142
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,356
but you know what?

143
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,386
That's not the point.

144
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,566
This is inappropriate.

145
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,736
I'm sorry.

146
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,256
You're right. I'll shut it down.

147
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,590
Thank you.

148
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,156
- Hey.
- Hey.

149
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,056
Lucy.

150
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,656
Ok, wait, she brought
a gun into your house?

151
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,826
- I know.
- With your children there?

152
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,726
- I know.
- And you're a cop.

153
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,176
She knows.

154
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,766
Well, good luck finding a replacement.

155
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,486
I scheduled three nanny
interviews last week.

156
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,766
Two of them were hired by other families

157
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,246
before I could even meet with them,

158
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,526
and then the third one flaked.

159
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,216
I thought you had someone you liked.

160
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,906
Yeah. She can't do full-time.

161
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,746
And James is expanding
the community center,

162
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,776
so I need to find childcare in two weeks,

163
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,126
or Leah comes to crime scenes with me.

164
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,536
Any leads?

165
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,436
I have an interview later on today.

166
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,786
You want in?

167
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,616
Weeding through applicants together

168
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,236
could be a lot less painful.

169
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,586
Send me her background check,

170
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,626
and I'll start brainstorming questions.

171
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,416
Blair?

172
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,106
Dr. London? What are you doing here?

173
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,526
- Ride-along.
- With who?

174
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,976
Dr. London.

175
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,806
I'm sergeant Bradford.
You've signed all the waivers?

176
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,286
- I have.
- Great.

177
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,806
Officer thorsen, you're riding with us.

178
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,396
Great.

179
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,876
I mean, yes, sir.

180
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,986
Go get the war bags.

181
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,630
Yes, sir.

182
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,746
Interesting, bringing
Aaron along as a buffer.

183
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,646
Classic avoidant attachment style.

184
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,986
Avoidant what?

185
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,816
It means you prefer
surface-level relationships

186
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,956
to deep intimacy.

187
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,646
It's a defense mechanism
that can develop

188
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,826
when a person is
raised by an overly strict

189
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,306
or domineering parent.

190
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,136
My guess is father.

191
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,446
All right.

192
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,106
Just so we're clear, I'm not a fan

193
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,796
of this or therapy in general,

194
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,766
so don't expect me to over share.

195
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,456
Like I said, surface-level.

196
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,146
But it's not my intention to
make you feel uncomfortable.

197
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,946
In fact, I'm hoping we can
enjoy a nice, boring day

198
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,496
on patrol together.

199
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,776
No such thing.

200
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,466
I know you're worried about me, but I

201
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,746
I really don't need babysitting.

202
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,156
- It's...
- I'm not here to babysit.

203
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,576
You've been through a
lot... detective's exam, Tim.

204
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,306
I would be remiss if I
didn't check in with you.

205
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,686
And by check in, you mean evaluate?

206
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,586
Aaron, I'm... I'm hosting a going-away

207
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,766
dinner for Tamara tonight.

208
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,356
- Are you free?
- For sure.

209
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,596
- Count me in.
- Great.

210
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,976
You're also invited, sir.

211
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,976
Thank you.

212
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,216
Me and Luna have plans already.

213
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,466
Of course.

214
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,396
Are you ready?

215
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,016
- Yeah.
- Ok.

216
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,716
- Good luck.
- You, too.

217
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,986
I think you're right.

218
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,506
This definitely won't be boring.

219
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,126
Yeah.

220
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:55,826
Why is rent so high?

221
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,966
I'd say it's a complicated patchwork

222
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,206
of nimbyism, building restrictions,

223
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,726
wage stagnation.

224
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,246
Not helpful?

225
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,316
You could just wait till you
graduate from the fto program.

226
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,426
You'll be making a lot more money.

227
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,326
I just... I barely got any sleep last night.

228
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,326
My roommate and her boyfriend are very

229
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,706
vocal about their feelings.

230
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,806
You know, with Tamara moving out,

231
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,326
Lucy might need a new roommate.

232
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,636
- Ooh.
- No?

233
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,916
No, nothing.

234
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,716
It's just, I'd be Lucy's rebound roommate

235
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,506
after being dumped by Tamara and Tim.

236
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,166
I'm pretty sure that apartment's gonna be

237
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,826
an emotional minefield.

238
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,996
7-Adam-200.

239
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,516
2-73-5, your beat.

240
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,826
Male versus female in a
verbal, possible physical.

241
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,516
- Details to your box.
- You are psycho!

242
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,826
You left.

243
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,516
I thought you loved me!

244
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,006
- You just disappeared!
- I didn't have a choice.

245
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,596
- What does that even mean?
- What do you mean?

246
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,006
- I didn't have a...
- What's going on?

247
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,216
- Good, you're here.
- Arrest him.

248
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,766
No, what? No, ghosting is not a crime.

249
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,906
You didn't ghost me.

250
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,186
You faked your own death.

251
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,776
Your mom called me in tears.

252
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,256
Who even was that?

253
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,126
- My new girlfriend.
- God, I hate you!

254
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,296
- Hey, whoa, whoa, ok, ok.
- Whoa, that's assault.

255
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,436
Ok, ok.

256
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,856
Listen, take a breath.

257
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,786
As truly awful as what he did is,

258
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,206
and it is absolutely psychotic

259
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,236
he is not worth whatever revenge fantasy

260
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,616
you've got going on in your head, ok?

261
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,796
So just breathe.

262
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,376
I thought we were happy.

263
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,036
I thought he was the
one, and then it just ended.

264
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,806
And at least when he
was dead, it made sense.

265
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,876
I was sad, but it made sense.

266
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,140
And now I...

267
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,466
Well, that was fun.

268
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,296
- Thanks for the assist.
- Excuse me?

269
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,616
Ok, all right, all right. He's not worth it.

270
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,956
Good day, sir.

271
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,826
Sir, was that a setup just now?

272
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:37,996
Excuse me?

273
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,616
Tim just bailed on me, and our first call

274
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,316
involves a woman who's
literally being ghosted?

275
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,836
- I mean, it's...
- You watch too much reality TV.

276
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,836
Now, I promise you, I do not care enough

277
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,356
about your personal drama to hire actors

278
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,000
to put on a little show for you.

279
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,646
I'm sorry.

280
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,956
I do watch a little bit too much reality TV.

281
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,986
It's my bad.

282
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,506
7-Adam-15.

283
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,816
Missing a runaway
teenager, has been reported

284
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,646
at 2923 Malden in at water village.

285
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,640
Please respond.

286
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,696
- She's gone.
- Who's gone?

287
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,326
Emma, my babysitter.

288
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,876
Come on in.

289
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,986
I got home from work,
and my daughter was

290
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,816
all alone, screaming her head off.

291
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,676
You're sure she's not
somewhere in the house?

292
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,816
Yes, I looked.

293
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,156
She's not here, and her car's gone.

294
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,956
Well, did you check the nanny cam?

295
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,506
This is all it showed.

296
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,406
Ok, Chloe.

297
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,686
We're gonna put you in here.

298
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,656
Ok. I'll be back.

299
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,006
Has she ever done
anything like this before?

300
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,836
Never. She's a really good kid.

301
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,176
She's been babysitting for
us since Chloe was a newborn.

302
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,806
She wouldn't just
leave her here all alone.

303
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,210
Something must have happened.

304
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,746
- Does Emma have a record?
- No.

305
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,226
She's been with the
family over two years.

306
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,396
No drama. Always on time.

307
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,986
Early admission to Stanford.

308
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,856
A lot more squared away
than I was at her age.

309
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,676
So we're thinking kidnapping?

310
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,576
It's possible, but her car is gone.

311
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,826
She might have left of her own volition.

312
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,276
Let's hope.

313
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,036
We have a warrant in
process for her phone.

314
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,756
More units are en route.

315
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,376
We need you to canvass
the neighborhood.

316
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,696
Statements, doorbell
cameras, you know the drill.

317
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,036
Copy that.

318
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,936
Can you imagine coming
home to find your kids alone?

319
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,790
It makes my nanny seem
downright responsible.

320
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,290
Nolan just uploaded a video
from the house doorbell cam.

321
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,086
Ok.

322
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,396
That's her arriving.

323
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,320
What about her leaving?

324
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:50,126
That's weird.

325
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,196
Why wouldn't she
just use the front door?

326
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,576
To avoid being seen on camera.

327
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,136
Suggesting she didn't
want anyone to know

328
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,066
- she was leaving.
- Yeah, that makes sense.

329
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,656
I mean, she wouldn't
want the olsens knowing

330
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,926
she left their kid alone.

331
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,446
Which also means she
thought she'd be back

332
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,316
before anyone noticed.

333
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,796
Suggesting she knew the
person she was about to meet.

334
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,146
Stranger abductions are incredibly rare.

335
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,736
I mean, it's always the boyfriend, right?

336
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,776
Boyfriend, ex, classmate
with an unrequited crush.

337
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,156
Look, check with dispatch to see

338
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,496
if they have a list of Emma's
family and friends yet.

339
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,946
Breakups are a trigger for many men,

340
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,296
especially since
stereotypical gender roles

341
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,776
prevent them from seeking out help

342
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,296
for fear of appearing weak.

343
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,476
You know, I was trained
that making an assumption

344
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,306
about an individual based on stereotypes

345
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,330
is how you end up
arresting the wrong suspect.

346
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,446
So it looks like Bradford and thorsen

347
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,656
and checking out Emma's ex.

348
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,006
It's a good call.

349
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,146
You and Tim speak since the breakup?

350
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,486
Nope.

351
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,076
I thought you didn't care
about my personal life.

352
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,526
I mean, you don't have to

353
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,906
I care if it impacts the job.

354
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,156
Tim was a subject of an ia inquiry.

355
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,946
Did you two break up
around the same time?

356
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:55,126
I can't help but to wonder
if there's a connection.

357
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,336
Nope, it's just a bad week.

358
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,546
- Chen.
- Yeah?

359
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,926
If Tim puts you in an unethical position,

360
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,206
and you feel like you
have to cover for him

361
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,476
- no, no.
- I mean, I just

362
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,276
sir, it's nothing like that.

363
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,206
I know that the timing is weird,

364
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:12,456
but I think it's pretty simple, you know?

365
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,386
He's just emotionally unavailable.

366
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,806
The most upset I ever saw
him was when the diamondbacks

367
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,666
swept the Dodgers
during the division playoffs,

368
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:22,846
so that's a huge red flag, right?

369
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,536
I mean, that was hard to watch.

370
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,056
You know, I

371
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,816
I don't know why you brought that up.

372
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,476
All right, Emma was babysitting

373
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,816
to save up for college.

374
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,476
$30 an hour. Not bad.

375
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,646
30?

376
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,236
- You're kidding.
- Kids are expensive.

377
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,336
Get ready.

378
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,686
That's... ok.

379
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,066
We would need her 50 hours a week.

380
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,516
- That would be...
- That's $78,000 a year.

381
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,826
I can't afford that.

382
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,416
That is just crazy.

383
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,316
In my day, it was simple.

384
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,556
All you had to do was give
a neighborhood kid 20 bucks

385
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,876
and all the pizza she could eat.

386
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,016
Ok, no one does that anymore.

387
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,776
Even then, I think that
was a labor violation.

388
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,776
23-31, go to a backup channel.

389
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,916
Copy. We're 10-3 to channel 9.

390
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,840
How much do you pay your nanny?

391
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,676
With all the overtime last year,

392
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,546
she probably pulled down 80.

393
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,266
Childcare is more than my mortgage.

394
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,506
Ooh.

395
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,996
I was a nanny for a
few years after college,

396
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,996
and I made way more than I do now.

397
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,376
The thing is, we used
to be happy with sitters

398
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,896
who just kept a kid alive.

399
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,276
Now we want them to
basically have a master's degree

400
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,906
in childhood development

401
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:24,416
with a minor in musical theater.

402
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,776
I just got Emma's phone records.

403
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,116
This is interesting.

404
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,086
Her last text was from
Olivia and just says, "help."

405
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:36,636
The number is registered
to Olivia Lane, 18,

406
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,436
lives with her parents.

407
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,606
Scratch that.

408
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,956
Dad's in prison, has
been for seven years.

409
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,476
Nolan, you're closer.

410
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,576
- I'm sending you the address.
- All right.

411
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,096
We're on it.

412
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,500
Thanks.

413
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,626
What did Emma's ex have to say?

414
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:55,656
Ex?

415
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,836
The held hands a couple times

416
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,246
at a roller rink in seventh grade.

417
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,286
Not exactly Romeo and Juliet.

418
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,946
No sign of any obvious romances

419
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,596
on her clip talk, mostly
photos of her and Olivia.

420
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,806
Maybe they're the couple.

421
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,946
I mean, that would
explain why Emma would

422
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:07,946
drop everything for Olivia.

423
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,396
Could be.

424
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,916
Female friendships are
really intense at that age,

425
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,916
and a lot of romantic feelings
start out as platonic love.

426
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,226
You and Lucy were friends first, right?

427
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,816
I was her to.

428
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,126
Ok, you know what?

429
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,336
I forgot to give that kid my card.

430
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,336
Go run it up to him.

431
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,990
Yes, sir.

432
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,966
Hey, listen. I know what you're doing.

433
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,246
It's not a secret, and I
meant what I said before.

434
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,246
Breakups do trigger feelings of
depression and anxiety in men.

435
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,356
I'm not depressed.

436
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,526
I broke up with her.

437
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,876
And from what I can tell,

438
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,666
you're experiencing
a lot of guilt about that.

439
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,116
Internalizing guilt and shame
leads to self-directed anger,

440
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,186
even self-harm and suicide.

441
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,156
So you can keep
stonewalling me if you want,

442
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,846
but if I can't tell if you're headed down

443
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,366
a self-destructive path by
the end of this ride-along,

444
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,166
I'll have no choice but
to have you sidelined

445
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,506
until I can perform a
proper psychiatric evaluation.

446
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,996
- Everything ok?
- No.

447
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,486
No, the next time I send
you to do something, you run.

448
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,966
You just wasted valuable minutes,

449
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,146
which could have been
the difference between

450
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:07,316
life and death for Emma.

451
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,530
Good afternoon.

452
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,330
Coming!

453
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,516
That bitch make
another noise complaint?

454
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,896
No, we're looking for
your daughter, Olivia.

455
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,246
- Is she here?
- No.

456
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,656
What'd she do?

457
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,046
Her friend Emma is missing.

458
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,426
We think she might be in danger.

459
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,696
They're always at the
Olsen house, babysitting.

460
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,046
Right, well, they're not there,

461
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,706
and both their phones are offline.

462
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,226
I told Olivia that phone
is her responsibility.

463
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,566
If she doesn't pay her
bill, not my problem.

464
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,156
Well, do you have any idea where

465
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,336
the girls might have gone?

466
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,746
My daughter's 18.

467
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,676
I don't keep track of her every move.

468
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,376
I'm sure she'll turn up.

469
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,616
I'm starting to see why Olivia spent

470
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,966
so much time at the olsens'.

471
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,626
Nolan, we were able to get
into Olivia's Uber account.

472
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,796
Lucy and grey are checking out

473
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,270
the last location she was dropped.

474
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,356
Well, the house is a rental

475
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,186
overseen by a management company.

476
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,806
Matthew Olsen works for that company.

477
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,286
The dad Emma babysits for?

478
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,636
Yeah.

479
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,296
Why was Olivia coming
to his rental property?

480
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,986
Is this Emma's car?

481
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,266
All right.

482
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,616
Let's go up there.

483
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,446
LAPD. We're coming in.

484
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,040
Clear.

485
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,086
Clear.

486
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,466
- Clear.
- Clear.

487
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,236
Hey, sarge, I got something.

488
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,756
So do I.

489
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,796
- No sign of the girls?
- No.

490
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,006
It feels like someone spends
a lot of time here, though.

491
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,496
There's takeout
containers in the garbage,

492
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,146
shampoo bottles in the bathroom.

493
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,256
Olivia ubers here twice a week.

494
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,426
A hook-up house.

495
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,976
According to the management company,

496
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,296
the unit is listed under repairs.

497
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,326
They haven't been showing
it for the last two months.

498
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,816
So Matthew knew he could
come and go as he pleased.

499
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,126
Ok.

500
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,336
So Matthew and Olivia
are having an affair.

501
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,646
She tells him that she's pregnant.

502
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,716
They get into a fight.

503
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,066
She gets scared.

504
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,036
She texts Emma, "help."

505
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,826
Emma bails on babysitting
and then gets here

506
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,176
and interrupts whatever was going on.

507
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,036
Matthew realizes if he
wants to keep his life,

508
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,666
he has to silence both girls.

509
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,906
Intimate partner violence
is the number one

510
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,836
cause of death of pregnant women.

511
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,326
And there's a gun
registered in Matthew's name.

512
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,876
Tracks with the blood you found.

513
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,156
All right. We know someone's hurt.

514
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,636
But until otherwise confirmed,

515
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,916
we have to assume both girls are alive

516
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,916
and counting on us to rescue them.

517
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,646
We need to put a bolo
out for Matthew Olsen

518
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,096
and bring his wife in.

519
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,996
Air 3's in search of suspect's car,

520
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,586
a 2008 silver Ford SUV,
license number 3 John Robert,

521
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,476
queen 1-5-8.

522
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,896
Your husband has been
using a vacant house

523
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,246
to conduct an affair with Olivia Lane.

524
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,246
Emma's friend?

525
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,656
No.

526
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,006
She's a child.

527
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,006
You're wrong.

528
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,316
Olivia helps out with Chloe.

529
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,906
She's like part of the family.

530
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,906
Ok, Regina, I need you to think back

531
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,326
on Matthew and Olivia's interactions.

532
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,506
You said she sometimes
helps with Chloe?

533
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,196
Yeah, but Matt's usually at work.

534
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,870
So am I.

535
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,886
But not always?

536
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,096
Sometimes Matt works from
home while Emma and Olivia

537
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,966
watch the baby, but he'd
ask Emma to bring Olivia

538
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,136
to make it less boring, like
he was doing Emma a favor,

539
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,276
letting her friend come over.

540
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,286
He'd always turn the nanny cam off.

541
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,466
I think I'm gonna be sick.

542
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,806
Right now, like detective Harper said,

543
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,806
we need to focus on
finding your husband.

544
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,466
I don't know. I don't know.

545
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,956
I thought he was at work.

546
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:34,726
He preyed on her, in
our house... For years.

547
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,276
Here you go.

548
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,960
I'm so sorry.

549
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,766
That poor woman.

550
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,030
Yeah.

551
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,386
Crap.

552
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,766
I forgot about the nanny interview.

553
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,636
She's already at the café.

554
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,916
See if she minds doing it on the road.

555
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,986
All right.

556
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,296
Absolutely.

557
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,436
Infant cpr certified.

558
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:01,816
I actually got super into first aid last year.

559
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,266
So yeah, I completed the red cross

560
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,646
wilderness training program.

561
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,406
So if you need someone
to treat snow blindness,

562
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,966
I'm your girl.

563
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,416
That's impressive.

564
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,696
And you have a bachelor of science?

565
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,216
Yes, my undergraduate
degree is in child psychology.

566
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,146
I was working on my
master's, but life got in the way.

567
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,326
Hablas español?

568
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,366
Why are you leaving
your current employer?

569
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,536
Well, I'm... I'm bound by an nda,

570
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,886
so I can't really talk about my last family,

571
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,646
but let's just say it wasn't a good fit.

572
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:41,476
And you can't tell us who it was for?

573
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,656
Sorry.

574
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,726
Blink once if it was a Kardashian.

575
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:53,176
This all started because of babysitting.

576
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,696
Babysitting.

577
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,636
I mean, is there anywhere
in this city that is safe?

578
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,456
I know you're worried
about Tamara being out there

579
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,666
on her own, but you should
be proud of showing that girl

580
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,876
that kind of unconditional love that

581
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,576
gave her the courage to leave.

582
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,466
You're right.

583
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,166
I guess you just have to let people go,

584
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:14,476
even the ones you care the most about.

585
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,096
Are we still talking about Tamara?

586
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,066
I just

587
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,556
I don't... I don't know why
this happened, you know?

588
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,286
And no matter how hard I
try, I can't stop thinking about it.

589
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,736
How... how did he let go so easily?

590
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,876
I really, really thought that
our relationship was worth

591
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,086
more than just some
cheap, cliché nonsense

592
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,606
about how I deserve better.

593
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,776
I mean, shouldn't I be the
one that decides what I deserve

594
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,576
and if I even want better?

595
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,746
Even if I wanted total self-destruction,

596
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,056
that is for me to decide.

597
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,786
It's... it's my life.

598
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,896
I know what you're thinking, that I was

599
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,626
too hard on the kid, but that's my style.

600
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,386
And he needs to understand
that every minute that goes by

601
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,726
makes it less likely
we'll find these girls alive.

602
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,626
You're under a lot of stress,
and not just from the case.

603
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,976
Whatever went down with
you and your army buddy

604
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,216
must have been bad for you

605
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,326
- to be bounced back to patrol.
- Yeah.

606
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,326
I own my mistakes, and I move on.

607
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,636
Except you haven't.

608
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,256
I mean, how could you
when your whole identity

609
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,746
is wrapped up in acting honorably?

610
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,916
My guess is that's
had a devastating effect

611
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,436
on your self-esteem, which is why

612
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,226
- you've been punishing yourself.
- Ok.

613
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,606
What... what are you talking about?

614
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,436
Depriving yourself of something you love

615
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,740
that brings you joy... or
more accurately, someone.

616
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,996
Ok.

617
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,446
So the secretary said that Matthew

618
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,626
never came back from
his "lunch meeting."

619
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,626
Of course.

620
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,650
His poor wife.

621
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,776
Hey, Bailey. What's up?

622
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,356
Hey, how do you feel about having sex

623
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,636
in the back of an ambulance?

624
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,676
I feel like I should maybe pull over first

625
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,956
and then take you off of speakerphone.

626
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,166
Hang on one second.

627
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,136
And go.

628
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,336
I'm just saying, the gurneys are not

629
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,476
as uncomfortable as they look.

630
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,966
Yes.

631
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,486
I am thinking there
may be more than one

632
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,966
communicable disease back there.

633
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,206
Yes, but my temperature is elevated.

634
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,656
So this is a perfect window.

635
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,656
Right. Right.

636
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,866
Not a great time for me, though.

637
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,216
We're looking for two missing girls.

638
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,936
We'll still be good tonight, though, right?

639
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,186
Of course. I'll see you tonight.

640
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,186
Excellent. Thank you.

641
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:17,706
I will see you then.

642
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,536
So sorry about that.

643
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,606
I mean, you've only
been trying for two weeks,

644
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,466
and she's ready for
an ambulance hookup?

645
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,156
Bailey does not know
how to do anything halfway.

646
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,336
I'm guessing she's in some
kind of contest with herself

647
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,026
to see how fast she can conceive.

648
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,886
Yeah, well, I mean, she probably knows

649
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,026
that the more time that
goes by, the less likely it is.

650
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,166
Do you know what a
geriatric pregnancy is?

651
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,306
If it's not ending with a
Benjamin button baby,

652
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,796
then probably not.

653
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,526
Well, it's, any pregnancy after 35.

654
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,006
Ouch.

655
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,836
All units, they flagged
an incoming 911 call

656
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,526
from Emma lautner.

657
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,496
Dispatch, can you patch that through?

658
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,876
Please. I'm so scared.

659
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,256
Where are you?

660
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,356
I don't know.

661
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,436
I got away, but... no!

662
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,816
Dispatch, do you
have a location on that?

663
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,916
Working on it.

664
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,716
Do you think Olivia got away, too?

665
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,740
I don't know.

666
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,376
All right. You take left.

667
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,656
I'll take right. Emma?

668
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,276
LAPD.

669
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,030
You here? It's safe to come out.

670
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,980
It's Emma.

671
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,906
We'll have a patrol
officer drive you home.

672
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:02,326
Cool.

673
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:03,496
I've never ridden a police car before.

674
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,116
That's exactly what we want to hear.

675
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,636
Jan, can you drive Sidney
wherever she needs to go?

676
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,646
Vip service.

677
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,816
I could get used to that.

678
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,126
Thanks.

679
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,166
- Dibs.
- Dibs.

680
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,786
No, I found her.

681
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:14,956
My mom is at my house.

682
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,956
I need someone now.

683
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,106
Detectives, I discovered
the body back there.

684
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,796
Cleared the scene,
set up a command post.

685
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,106
How'd she die?

686
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,586
It looks like a gunshot
wound to the chest.

687
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:28,286
So she got away, but
Matthew tracked her down.

688
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,006
And what about Olivia?

689
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,636
After you've killed once,
the second time's not as hard.

690
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,496
If her friend Olivia is still alive,

691
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,636
then my guess is she
won't have much time.

692
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,536
See, this is a cute area.

693
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,776
Quiet.

694
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,156
Walking distance to lots of restaurants.

695
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,746
Possibly concealing the whereabouts

696
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,646
of a dangerous kidnapper?

697
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,816
How much is a one-bedroom?

698
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,336
Way out of my price range.

699
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,206
How much did you say
Lucy pays for her place again?

700
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,476
That I don't know, but I
do know it's rent-controlled.

701
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,176
What? How?

702
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,036
I'm not saying that moving
in with Lucy after a breakup

703
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,036
is the perfect situation, but,

704
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,666
but her moon is in Taurus,
which means she puts value

705
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,456
onto a stable home life,
even if her emotional world

706
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,326
is feeling out of control.

707
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,660
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

708
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,886
Sarge, I'm really sorry for dumping

709
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,576
all my personal business on you earlier.

710
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,336
I'm glad you got it all out,

711
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,956
but I think there's
someone else you really

712
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,506
want to say all that to.

713
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:26,166
All units, be advised.

714
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,896
Suspect's silver Ford SUV
has been identified on traffic cam

715
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,556
heading north on riverside
drive towards Griffith park

716
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,136
approximately 15 minutes ago.

717
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,386
Calling all units in the area to respond.

718
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,866
We're right around the corner.

719
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,796
Control, 7-Adam-100
responding and entering

720
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,666
the park at crystal Springs drive.

721
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,076
Adam-200.

722
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,496
We're entering on zoo drive.

723
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:47,086
Control, 7-Adam-15 responding

724
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,156
via Griffith park drive.

725
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,156
Adam-3 responding,
heading west over the old zoo.

726
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,716
We have additional units
inbound from the observatory.

727
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,866
Please stop!

728
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,276
- What's that?
- That's Olivia.

729
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,626
Please stop! Stop!

730
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,726
He killed Emma!

731
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,006
- My god.
- Olivia.

732
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,216
Olivia, I need you to calm down.

733
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,946
- Calm down.
- My god.

734
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,116
Where's Matthew?

735
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,286
I don't know.

736
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,226
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

737
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,776
I jumped out.

738
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,126
He was gonna kill me.

739
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,126
It's ok.

740
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,716
Control, this is 7-Adam-100.

741
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,716
We found Olivia. Send ra.

742
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,896
Repeat, Olivia is safe.

743
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,136
She's alive.

744
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,856
Thank god.

745
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,756
I don't think I could have

746
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,316
handled another dead girl today.

747
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,976
I was so scared.

748
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,666
I tried to end things with
him, but he wouldn't let me,

749
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,116
so I texted Emma for help.

750
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,466
And the next thing I
know, he had us tied up.

751
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,116
And he said for us to be together, we

752
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,636
we had to run away and

753
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,466
ok, we don't have to
talk about this right now.

754
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,056
All these officers need to know

755
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,816
is if you have any idea
where Matthew might be going.

756
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,446
I don't know.

757
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,096
But then Emma escaped, and so he,

758
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,486
but after she was gone, it got worse.

759
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,976
He was driving like a
maniac, and he had a gun.

760
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,526
And I thought... I thought
he was gonna kill us both,

761
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:26,286
so I jumped out.

762
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,906
- And I ran.
- Ok.

763
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,186
You're doing great, Olivia.

764
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:30,606
You're very brave.

765
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,536
But do you know which way he went?

766
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,126
There's, like, a lookout
up the hill, on the fire road.

767
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,126
We used to go there
to... you know, to be alone.

768
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,956
Air-3, suspect may be
headed to a lookout point

769
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,446
on northeast fire road.

770
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,686
Be advised, he is armed.

771
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,206
Copy. Heading that way.

772
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,966
7-Adam-15 also responding.

773
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,736
Hi, Olivia. I'm Bailey.

774
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,846
I'm here to help.

775
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,226
Where are you hurt?

776
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:11,366
My... my eye and my leg and my arm.

777
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,366
Ok.

778
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,816
I see that.

779
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,306
We're gonna have
to get you to a hospital

780
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,026
to make sure there's no internal injuries.

781
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,756
Yeah. Need anything else?

782
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,856
No. She did great.

783
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,686
We're gonna find him.

784
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,346
Control, I see a car that
matches the suspect's.

785
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,596
It looks like a silver SUV parked off

786
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,426
the road near water tank 76.

787
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,426
Copy that. We are en route.

788
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:37,216
We're five minutes away.

789
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,266
LAPD.

790
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,916
Hands in the air.

791
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,726
Is that

792
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,036
that's brain matter, and
he's got a gunshot wound

793
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,386
and what looks to be a
blunt force trauma wound

794
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,960
on the head as well.

795
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,736
He's in rigor.

796
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,916
How?

797
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,296
He was just seen on a traffic cam

798
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,296
less than 30 minutes ago.

799
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,056
Well, at least his car was.

800
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,200
Do you notice anything
unusual about that head wound?

801
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,956
His exit wound's too big.

802
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,196
It looks more like he
cracked open his skull,

803
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,616
and there's hardly any blood in the car.

804
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,120
There's no way this is where he died.

805
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,486
Suicide?

806
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,796
I doubt that.

807
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,936
I think he's been dead about two hours.

808
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,496
Which means Olivia's been lying.

809
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,976
She's en route to the hospital with Bailey.

810
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,946
We need to warn her. Olivia's a suspect.

811
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,776
Ra-213, this is 7-Adam-15.

812
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,946
You copy?

813
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,776
Copy, Adam-15. John, what's up?

814
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,126
Be advised, when you get to the hospital,

815
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,956
we got a 10-15.

816
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,266
Copy that.

817
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,786
Thanks for letting me know.

818
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:58,746
What does that mean, 10-15?

819
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,926
The police are gonna meet
us in the ambulance bay.

820
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,136
It's for your safety.

821
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,380
Look out! Look out!

822
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,116
What happened?

823
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,286
She heard Nolan on the radio,

824
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,286
realized something was up,

825
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,806
and ran into the neighborhood.

826
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,776
She has my knife.

827
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,606
Control, 7-Adam-100.

828
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,436
In pursuit of a Caucasian
female, Olivia Lane.

829
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,336
The suspect is headed
through the neighborhood

830
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,026
south of los feliz in blue
jeans and a pink hoodie.

831
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,336
Suspect is armed with a knife.

832
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,336
Send backup in airship.

833
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,096
Copy that, 7-Adam-100.

834
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,966
Air-3 is searching for suspect.

835
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:42,486
Airship-2 joining the search.

836
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,516
Heading west on lowry.

837
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,896
No sign of suspect.

838
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,386
Now we're on avocado street.

839
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,286
It changed names when
we crossed Rowena.

840
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,046
Correction.

841
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,736
Heading west on avocado.

842
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,806
Copy that.

843
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,046
We're headed east on
price, which just turned into,

844
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,846
Glen... no, wait.

845
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,226
Los nietos.

846
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,676
I hate this part of los feliz.

847
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,856
The street names change every block.

848
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:11,376
Adam-200 on talmage,
crossing Ben lomond place.

849
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,996
Did... didn't we just
cross Ben lomond drive?

850
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,896
Yeah.

851
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,046
Parked car up ahead.

852
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,596
Control, 7-Adam-15.

853
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,146
We have a possible
contact with the suspect

854
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,946
on the 400 block of los nietos.

855
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,056
Appears to be hiding
behind a blue Honda.

856
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,676
Olivia?

857
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,016
Come on.

858
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,746
Suspect is heading east on los nietos.

859
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,376
Easy. Easy, easy.

860
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,616
- Stay back!
- Easy.

861
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,966
- Ok.
- Stay back!

862
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,066
No, no, no, no. We're
not coming any closer.

863
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,616
Just put the knife down.

864
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,966
Olivia, there's nowhere to go.

865
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,510
I don't think you want to die tonight.

866
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,046
Come on.

867
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,286
Matt... Matt was the
only person who cared.

868
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:04,186
I thought he loved me.

869
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,296
No, Olivia, he was manipulating you.

870
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,886
I... when I found out I was pregnant,

871
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:19,886
I freaked out, but then... then I thought,

872
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,996
maybe this could be a good thing,

873
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,276
if I finally have someone
who loves me unconditionally.

874
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,586
Yeah.

875
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:32,106
But he said I was the worst
mistake he'd ever made.

876
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:35,316
Then he hit me.

877
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,396
I... I wasn't trying to kill him.

878
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,286
I don't even remember
what I hit him with.

879
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,636
It... it was just in my hand.

880
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,026
I texted Emma, and we
were gonna Bury him.

881
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,296
But then Emma freaked out,

882
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,816
and she was gonna call the cops.

883
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,816
And you killed her?

884
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,686
I panicked.

885
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,476
She was my best friend.

886
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,236
- It's ok.
- I'm sorry.

887
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,586
- It's ok.
- I'm so sorry.

888
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,176
I'm so sorry.

889
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,116
Control, 7-Adam-15.

890
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,676
Suspect in custody.

891
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,876
We're at code 4.

892
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,856
Ok, I know I shouldn't,
but I feel bad for Olivia.

893
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,726
Matthew started grooming
her when she was still a minor.

894
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,686
This girl's got no one in
her life looking out for her.

895
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,176
And then this older guy starts
promising to take care of her.

896
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,666
And the minute she actually
needs him to, he turns on her.

897
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,046
I mean, that would mess anyone up.

898
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,666
I sympathize with her to a point,

899
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:47,046
but she did murder her
best friend in cold blood.

900
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,876
I feel bad for the wife.

901
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,396
Imagine finding out your partner

902
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,916
has been lying to you about everything.

903
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,196
That would turn your
whole world upside down.

904
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,986
Now she has to pick up the pieces

905
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,026
for both her and for her baby.

906
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,886
Hey, I've been thinking.

907
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,066
No, look, I know you and Wesley

908
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,826
can afford to pay Sidney
double what I can, so

909
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:09,176
I wouldn't do that to you.

910
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,826
If it was anyone else, I
would have hired her already.

911
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,666
But I have a solution
that will work nanny share.

912
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,666
We each pay half of her salary,

913
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,006
and she watches all three kids together.

914
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,846
I already called Sidney.
She was totally fine with it.

915
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,086
That is actually a great idea.

916
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,946
Thank you.

917
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:33,716
But since you have two young
kids, shouldn't you pay more?

918
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,616
Hey.

919
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,796
Hey.

920
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,526
Clocking out?

921
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,706
Really?

922
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,466
You really want to pretend like
nothing is going on right now?

923
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,046
Have you ever thought
that maybe I have something

924
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,296
I want to say to you?

925
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,266
You were so concerned
about what I deserve.

926
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,986
How about a real,
adult conversation, Tim?

927
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:12,376
Lucy, I can't give you
what you're looking for.

928
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,966
Then you clearly have more
to figure out than I realized.

929
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,966
And you need somebody
else besides me

930
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,796
to help you with that, so good luck.

931
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,626
Hey, Lucy, can I... no.

932
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,836
- It... it can wait.
- No, what's up?

933
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,286
No, I... I wanted to ask you something,

934
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,806
- but now... now it's better to...
- It... it's fine.

935
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,906
It's fine. Just walk with me.

936
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,466
- What's going on?
- Well, I

937
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:35,496
I don't want to overstep,
but Nolan mentioned

938
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,746
that, Tamara might be moving out

939
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:40,506
and you might be looking
for a new roommate?

940
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,096
Anyway, my current living situation is

941
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,576
well, it... it really sucks.

942
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,306
And I totally understand if it's too soon.

943
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,656
Just thought I'd throw
it out there, just in case.

944
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,006
Actually, I think that's a really great idea.

945
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:57,216
You know, tonight I'm throwing
a going-away dinner for Tamara.

946
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,526
If you can come, you should.

947
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,216
And... and we can talk logistics.

948
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,216
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

949
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,596
- Yeah.
- Ok.

950
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,976
Cool.

951
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:13,706
You wanted to see me, sir?

952
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:16,886
I did.

953
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:19,856
I just got off the phone with Dr. London.

954
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,376
And she failed me?

955
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,786
No, she found you to
be incredibly insightful.

956
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,866
So whatever's going on with you,

957
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,556
she doesn't seem to think that it's

958
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,146
going to have a negative
impact on your work.

959
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,796
You sound surprised.

960
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,526
Yeah, I... I guess I was expecting her

961
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,256
to say that I have a lot
of work to do on myself.

962
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,086
Do you?

963
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,256
I think so.

964
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,746
What would you say if I
started seeing her as a patient?

965
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,716
I'd say it takes a lot of
courage to ask for help.

966
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,826
Look, I know you are
competitive about everything.

967
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,176
And it's one of the
things I... I love about you.

968
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,486
I'm just starting to think maybe

969
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,826
putting that kind of
energy on baby-making

970
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,486
is putting too much pressure on you

971
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,356
to get pregnant immediately.

972
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,526
Just give it some time.

973
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,766
It'll happen.

974
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,496
Even if it does, I'm

975
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,356
I'm worried something's gonna go wrong.

976
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:21,296
I know so many women
who have had complications

977
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,956
who got pregnant at my age.

978
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,296
And just the number of women I've taken

979
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,376
to the hospital is... ok,
let's not start worrying

980
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,686
until we have some facts, all right?

981
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,966
Let's start with a visit
to the doctor next week.

982
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,586
- Ok.
- Ok.

983
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:40,316
And I know this feels
like you're all on your own,

984
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:45,760
but I'm here, and we are in this together.

985
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,736
But make no mistake,
once you are pregnant,

986
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,876
you are all on your own.

987
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,986
Well, that's true.

988
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,986
It is so weird seeing it like this.

989
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,956
But think of all the possibilities.

990
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,306
I mean, you could turn this into an office,

991
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:04,616
a meditation room, a yoga studio.

992
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,966
Actually, I think celina is gonna move in.

993
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,306
Wow.

994
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,656
Who knew I'd be so easy to replace?

995
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,136
No one could replace you.

996
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,456
Stop it.

997
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,976
Look, if you ever need anything

998
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,286
or if you end up hating
it, you just let me know,

999
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:22,636
and I will kick celina to the curb,

1000
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,636
like, in a heartbeat.

1001
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,016
In a heartbeat.

1002
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,636
I'll call you, promise.

1003
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,606
Ok. Good.

1004
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,336
I hope you know that you
always have a home with me.

1005
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,816
I know.

1006
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,956
Thank you.

1007
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,796
Stealing your car was probably the best

1008
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,206
decision I've ever made.

1009
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,316
Please don't tell that story at dinner.

1010
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,626
Ok? Please?

1011
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,626
Fine.

1012
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,326
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

1013
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,056
Yeah, I know.

1014
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:08,786
I have been thinking a lot

1015
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:13,786
about the things you
were saying today, and I

1016
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,966
I think you're right.

1017
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,796
I am mad at myself.

1018
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,866
I can see you tomorrow morning

1019
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,826
before your shift starts,

1020
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,526
unless this is an emergency.

1021
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,796
No.

1022
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,890
Yeah, tomorrow's... tomorrow's fine.

1023
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:31,380
Actually, wait.

1024
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,226
Maybe it is.

1025
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:36,940
Come on.

1026
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,330
Damn it.
