1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:01,257
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

2
00:00:01,282 --> 00:00:02,109
What's all this?

3
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:04,484
I'm studying for
the detective's exam.

4
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:05,967
Monica.

5
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:07,911
<i>She's smart, fairly ruthless,</i>

6
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,813
and God forbid you leave
the toilet seat up.

7
00:00:09,838 --> 00:00:11,464
Celina, look out!

8
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:12,657
<i>It seems obvious
that they were targeted.</i>

9
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,264
Bailey!

10
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,432
Leah!

11
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,146
Hi. Oh.

12
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:19,052
Angela had the baby.
It's a girl.

13
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:21,371
- Hey.
- Hey.

14
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,391
What's happening?

15
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,167
The list of possible
masterminds,

16
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,277
you were at the bottom.

17
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,554
Weaponizing Luke Moran
against the LAPD

18
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:32,157
has driven every cop in
the city away from our target.

19
00:00:32,217 --> 00:00:34,803
<i>By the time they realize
the damage we've done,</i>

20
00:00:34,828 --> 00:00:35,829
we'll be long gone.

21
00:00:50,691 --> 00:00:51,597
Shots fired.

22
00:00:51,622 --> 00:00:53,410
I am pinned down out front.
I need help.

23
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,180
Aaron's bleeding internally.

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,057
A surgeon must have missed
a bullet fragment.

25
00:01:05,057 --> 00:01:06,308
They're rushing him
into surgery.

26
00:01:06,308 --> 00:01:07,309
Is he gonna be all right?

27
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:08,435
<i>I-I don't know.</i>

28
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,436
What do I do?

29
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,854
Nothing you can do.

30
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:12,481
Just be there
to watch over him.

31
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:13,983
Do you guys need help?
Is there anything I can do to--

32
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:16,068
Negative. You still haven't
been cleared medically.

33
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:18,696
Celina.

34
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,949
We heard Aaron's back
in surgery.

35
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:23,409
Yeah, they just
rushed him in.

36
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:25,202
I, uh--I'm--
I'm on with Sergeant Grey.

37
00:01:25,202 --> 00:01:26,704
Wait, you guys are
checking out already?

38
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:28,998
You just had the baby.
- It's too noisy here.

39
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:30,916
We got the pediatrician
to sign off.

40
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,376
We're going home.
- Unless Grey needs

41
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:33,794
<i>something from us.</i>
- Negative.

42
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:36,130
Just please stick
with your police escort.

43
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,757
I thought we caught
the mastermind, but...

44
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:41,010
now I'm not too sure.

45
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,637
All right, explain it to me
like I'm a toddler.

46
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,640
This assault was well funded
and well executed.

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,851
But Lucas Moran had
$12 in the bank

48
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:50,811
and a well-documented history
of being a loner.

49
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,396
We're not buying
he had the resources

50
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:54,314
to pull off the attack.
- Or the contacts.

51
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,234
Maybe he met someone
in prison who helped him.

52
00:01:57,234 --> 00:01:59,570
Most likely, but who's
gonna spend a fortune

53
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,530
to kick a hornet's nest?

54
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,074
Who volunteers to piss off
the entire LAPD?

55
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:05,492
Somebody
with their own agenda.

56
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,494
Yeah, who wanted to focus
our attention on a patsy.

57
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,580
Divert all of our resources
to this neighborhood

58
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,831
so they can pull off
a new crime.

59
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:11,874
A new crime like what?

60
00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:13,375
No clue.
But I'd bet my life

61
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,418
it's happening right now.

62
00:02:17,546 --> 00:02:19,757
60 seconds ahead of schedule.
Let's keep it tight.

63
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:28,640
All right, we've been
through this a dozen times.

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,476
Cyesha and her crew meet
the inside man

65
00:02:30,476 --> 00:02:31,935
and gain control
of the security room

66
00:02:31,935 --> 00:02:33,228
while we take the lobby.

67
00:02:33,228 --> 00:02:35,314
Then 20 minutes
to load the armored car

68
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:36,815
while Kim does her thing.

69
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:38,776
You're really not gonna
tell us what Kim's thing is?

70
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:41,403
Correct. Just focus
on your individual jobs,

71
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:44,198
and we will be made of money
by this evening.

72
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,200
All right, synchronize.

73
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,035
Three, two, one.

74
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,244
Mark.

75
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:50,245
Let's go.

76
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:07,193
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

77
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:07,898
Any problems?

78
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:09,299
No, they're all
in the security cage

79
00:03:09,324 --> 00:03:10,325
for change of shift.

80
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:14,037
I am Glen Mercer,
U.S. Treasury Department

81
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:16,093
West Coast
Chief Security Officer.

82
00:03:16,118 --> 00:03:19,204
And I'm here for an unscheduled
security inspection.

83
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,881
<i>Yeah!</i>

84
00:03:29,186 --> 00:03:30,938
Grab the guns,
kill the feeds.

85
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,106
Hey!

86
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:35,598
- What the--
- Stop 'em!

87
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:39,233
What do I do?

88
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:43,833
Nothing.
Your part's over.

89
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,550
Phase One complete.

90
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,176
Copy that.
Moving on to Phase Two.

91
00:03:52,176 --> 00:03:53,553
What?

92
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:57,892
All right.

93
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:01,984
<i>Negative, 7-Metro-100.</i>

94
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,585
<i>There have been
no high-priority calls</i>

95
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,210
<i>in the last two hours
beside yours.</i>

96
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:06,735
All right, dispatch,
switch gears.

97
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,663
I want any anomalies,

98
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:09,374
no matter how small
or seemingly random--

99
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:11,484
<i>false alarm, noise complaint
that seems odd.</i>

100
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:14,460
Or totally crazy--
UFO sightings, mole people.

101
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:16,175
<i>Aside from
your earlier action,</i>

102
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,265
<i>it's a normal day in LA.</i>

103
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,851
<i>We average a dozen
bizarre calls an hour.</i>

104
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:21,045
<i>But none have been
from high-value targets.</i>

105
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:23,359
Ah, come on,
there's got to be something.

106
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:25,046
<i>Hold on.
This is a little unusual.</i>

107
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:27,507
<i>The Federal Reserve Bank has
an hourly check-in call</i>

108
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:28,882
<i>which is late.</i>

109
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,729
- How late?
<i>- 17 seconds.</i>

110
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,257
That's barely a blip.

111
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:33,304
But it's all we've got
to go on.

112
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:35,663
How often are they late?
<i>- Rarely, but it happens.</i>

113
00:04:35,688 --> 00:04:37,481
Federal Reserve is definitely
a high-value target.

114
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:38,882
All right,
I'm a few blocks from there.

115
00:04:38,907 --> 00:04:40,242
I'll swing by.
I'll check it out.

116
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,807
We might have a problem.

117
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,618
Cop's outside.

118
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,523
7-15 on site.

119
00:05:08,548 --> 00:05:09,925
Lobby's empty.

120
00:05:15,021 --> 00:05:16,731
Check that.
There's blood inside.

121
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:17,899
They're robbing
the Federal Reserve.

122
00:05:17,899 --> 00:05:19,108
Send backup, airship,

123
00:05:19,108 --> 00:05:20,693
and an ambulance
in case of casualties.

124
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,923
- Time's up.
- How the hell

125
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,633
did the cops get
onto us so fast?

126
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,385
I don't know.
But we got to go.

127
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,465
Almost there.

128
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,325
- Not good enough.
- Tough.

129
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,676
You need to buy me
another five minutes

130
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:00,912
to get through
this last firewall.

131
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:05,723
Aisha, we need
to pivot to Plan B.

132
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:07,375
Sacrifice the lambs.

133
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,151
Copy.

134
00:06:09,176 --> 00:06:11,012
Let's go.

135
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,998
Leave it!
- Let's go.

136
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:01,981
Shots fired.

137
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,175
I am pinned down out front.
I need help.

138
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:11,989
Duck!

139
00:07:27,557 --> 00:07:28,767
Finished.

140
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,310
And I injected a virus
that'll make it

141
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,437
impossible to figure out
what we did.

142
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:34,606
Suspect's down.

143
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:39,068
He's not conscious.
Not breathing.

144
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:41,154
Appears the shot came
from the third-floor window.

145
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:42,864
They sniped their own guy.

146
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:44,282
Why would they do that?

147
00:07:44,282 --> 00:07:45,909
They must have
a secondary escape route.

148
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,369
Didn't want to leave anyone
behind to flip on them.

149
00:07:48,369 --> 00:07:49,996
The tunnels.

150
00:07:49,996 --> 00:07:51,831
Let's get units rolling
to the egress points.

151
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,166
We don't have anybody
close by.

152
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,126
Harper, Nolan,
you're with me.

153
00:08:08,223 --> 00:08:09,849
Shots fired,
basement hallway.

154
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:10,892
Four suspects.

155
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:13,937
Ah!

156
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:17,148
Come on.
Go, go, go, go!

157
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:50,348
- Are you nervous?
- Nope.

158
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:52,183
Last shift
before the wedding.

159
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:54,060
- Yep.
- But you're still not nervous?

160
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,312
Nope.
What about you?

161
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:57,814
- What about me?
- Are you nervous

162
00:08:57,814 --> 00:08:59,107
that Detective Harper
will be taking over

163
00:08:59,107 --> 00:09:00,525
your training in my absence?

164
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:03,236
Oh.
I--she--

165
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:04,737
When did that happen?
- Last night.

166
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:05,822
Unless you'd prefer
Sergeant Bradford.

167
00:09:05,822 --> 00:09:07,073
No, no.

168
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:09,033
Well--no.
No, no.

169
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:10,368
What about Smitty?

170
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:12,036
I'm kidding.

171
00:09:12,036 --> 00:09:13,830
No, Detective Harper,
she's--she's great.

172
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,417
I mean, I'm sure I will learn
so much from her.

173
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:19,252
Not that you haven't
already taught me

174
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:21,713
everything I need to know.

175
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:23,006
Well, not that I still
don't have a lot of holes

176
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:24,215
in my training--

177
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,217
okay, not because
you're a bad TO.

178
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,927
It's--

179
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:30,847
Oh, thank God.

180
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:33,725
- What's the problem?
- My husband's missing.

181
00:09:33,725 --> 00:09:35,685
He--he went out last night,
and I haven't heard from him--

182
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,779
Oh, no.

183
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:54,537
Officers.

184
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:55,830
Found him.

185
00:09:57,582 --> 00:09:59,626
This way.

186
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:02,462
Any, um, advice
to help optimize

187
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:04,172
my experience
with Detective Harper?

188
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:05,840
- No.
- Why not?

189
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,676
Because so much of what we do
is dealing with the unknown.

190
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:11,095
I don't do you any service
by giving you cheat codes.

191
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:12,305
Cheat codes?
For what?

192
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,473
- No, nothing.
- Training with you.

193
00:10:13,473 --> 00:10:15,475
Oh, there are
no cheat codes for me.

194
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:17,471
I am an enigma wrapped
in a badass riddle.

195
00:10:17,496 --> 00:10:19,854
You got that, Boot?
- Yes, ma'am.

196
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:20,980
Why are you 10-8?

197
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,807
Uh, last shift
before I go on leave.

198
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:25,151
I know--you should be
hiding under a desk

199
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,904
until it is time to go home,
not out on the street.

200
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:30,531
- Why?
- The curse of the last shift.

201
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:33,242
Did nothing I taught you stick?
- Only the rational bits.

202
00:10:33,242 --> 00:10:34,994
You see, Detective Harper feels

203
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:37,205
that the last shift before
a vacation, a retirement,

204
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:39,457
a wedding is to be feared.

205
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:41,793
She's very superstitious.
- I mean, so am I.

206
00:10:41,793 --> 00:10:43,419
I'm riding with you.

207
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:45,296
Might as well write "collateral
damage" on my forehead.

208
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:46,464
Why didn't you tell me?

209
00:10:46,464 --> 00:10:47,799
Because unlike
Detective Harper...

210
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,175
I do not believe

211
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:51,010
in superstitions or curses.

212
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,180
Today is going to be
smooth sailing.

213
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,098
Hey, Bailey.
What's up?

214
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:57,016
Uh, we have a huge problem.

215
00:10:58,268 --> 00:11:00,270
That's great.
What's going on?

216
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,562
Well, the wedding planner
came by

217
00:11:01,562 --> 00:11:02,772
to check her lighting setup

218
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:04,691
and somehow shorted out
the HVAC system.

219
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,735
It's getting hot in here.

220
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,487
And it's supposed to be
even hotter this weekend.

221
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:11,322
And if we don't have
air conditioning--

222
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:12,824
Okay, we will. We will.
I can fix that.

223
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:14,409
- Now?
- N-now?

224
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:15,660
Uh, yes.
No, yeah.

225
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,120
She probably just tripped
a breaker.

226
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,830
Look, we're about
to go back out on patrol,

227
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:19,914
and we'll swing by.

228
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:21,749
Okay, thank you.

229
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:24,627
Is this a huge mistake,
doing the wedding here?

230
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:26,963
No.
No, this is gonna be amazing.

231
00:11:26,963 --> 00:11:29,173
Come on, best wedding ever,
I promise.

232
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:30,466
All right, I got to go.
I love you.

233
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:31,592
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

234
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:35,680
No, perfect.
It's gonna be just, uh...

235
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,223
you know, just--
Juarez, let's go.

236
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:40,351
Do we have to?

237
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,061
I mean, there's plenty
of paperwork we could fill out.

238
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:43,396
And I'm sure Sergeant Grey

239
00:11:43,396 --> 00:11:44,522
could find us things to do
at the station.

240
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:46,190
- Thanks.
- Hmm.

241
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,650
Hold your nerve,
Officer Juarez.

242
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,153
That's an order.
- Yes, sir.

243
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:01,114
Nice bike.

244
00:12:01,114 --> 00:12:02,866
Thank you.

245
00:12:02,866 --> 00:12:04,826
Doctor sign off
on you riding it?

246
00:12:04,826 --> 00:12:06,286
You mean, like, in writing?

247
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:08,246
All I'm saying is,
is take it easy.

248
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:10,540
It's your first day back,
and you're not 100% yet.

249
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,125
Hell, I'm not even 100%,

250
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:14,627
and I only had a baby,
not a near-death GSW.

251
00:12:14,627 --> 00:12:16,212
Yes, I will be careful,
I promise.

252
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:17,630
- Good.
- Yeah.

253
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,550
But the correct response
to my last sentence was,

254
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,886
childbirth is deeply traumatic
to a woman's body

255
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:24,679
and should never be minimized.

256
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,599
Right.
Got it.

257
00:12:27,599 --> 00:12:29,476
So, uh, how are you feeling?

258
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:31,519
Mm, 80%.

259
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,937
Sad to leave my baby

260
00:12:32,937 --> 00:12:34,814
but excited to use my brain
for something else.

261
00:12:34,814 --> 00:12:36,232
You?
- Same--

262
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:37,967
e-except the, you know,
baby part.

263
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,154
Yeah, I, um--

264
00:12:41,154 --> 00:12:43,281
I don't sleep well.

265
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:44,988
Too many nightmares.

266
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:47,494
But I'm hopeful that'll change
once we, uh,

267
00:12:47,494 --> 00:12:49,204
catch the crew
behind my shooting.

268
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:50,789
Any fresh leads?
- Not that I know of,

269
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:52,749
but it's my first day too.

270
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,084
All right,
here's what we know.

271
00:12:54,084 --> 00:12:56,211
The Federal Reserve heist
was a two-pronged attack.

272
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:57,754
In success,
they would have escaped

273
00:12:57,754 --> 00:12:59,547
with $30 million in cash
in an armored car.

274
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:01,299
And we never would have known
about the secondary,

275
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:02,759
much larger digital heist.

276
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,594
While computer forensics
are ongoing,

277
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:06,887
we've so far discovered
over a hundred million

278
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:10,040
small-dollar transfers designed
to fly beneath the radar.

279
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:12,192
Any progress
on identifying the crew

280
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:14,176
that died at the scene?

281
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,364
- No.
- How can that be?

282
00:13:15,389 --> 00:13:16,932
They were clearly
professional criminals.

283
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:18,918
No prints or DNA
in any database,

284
00:13:18,943 --> 00:13:20,965
and social media scrub of
their faces turned up nothing.

285
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,282
Our working theory is that

286
00:13:22,307 --> 00:13:24,101
a hacker sophisticated enough
to break through

287
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:25,200
the Treasury Department
firewalls

288
00:13:25,225 --> 00:13:26,778
could have purged
criminal histories

289
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:28,778
from law-enforcement databases
prior to the heist.

290
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:31,113
To sum it up,
this crew orchestrated

291
00:13:31,113 --> 00:13:32,782
a brutal attack on my people

292
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:34,567
in order to rob
the Federal Reserve,

293
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,594
killed three of their own
to slow us down,

294
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,129
and there's no way
to trace them

295
00:13:38,154 --> 00:13:39,280
or the fortune they stole?

296
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,653
And given how rich
they now are,

297
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:43,388
they could be anywhere
in the world.

298
00:13:44,936 --> 00:13:48,523
All right, listen up.
This crew attacked our people

299
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,249
in their homes,
killed six innocents.

300
00:13:50,274 --> 00:13:52,030
We won't let them
get away with this.

301
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,007
The only way this ends
is bad guys in handcuffs.

302
00:13:56,539 --> 00:13:58,483
Hey, shouldn't you be
out on patrol?

303
00:13:58,512 --> 00:14:00,055
I'm stealing a few minutes

304
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,707
to study
for the detective's exam.

305
00:14:01,732 --> 00:14:03,066
I've been slammed
with so much OT,

306
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:04,259
I've fallen way behind.

307
00:14:04,563 --> 00:14:07,050
Hey, can I ride with you today

308
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:08,743
so you can quiz me
in between calls?

309
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:10,964
Yeah, sure. But it's not
gonna solve your problem.

310
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:12,691
I mean, if Lieutenant Primm
really has it out for you,

311
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:13,511
he's not gonna follow

312
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:15,079
the normal playbook
with your oral exam.

313
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,511
He's gonna give you
some crazy scenarios,

314
00:14:16,536 --> 00:14:18,902
try and sabotage you.
- That's not fair.

315
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:20,707
The test should be the same
for everybody.

316
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:22,590
How the hell am I supposed
to study for wild cards?

317
00:14:22,623 --> 00:14:24,334
You can't, I mean,
but we can spend today

318
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:25,735
chasing outside-the-box calls,

319
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,136
try and widen
your knowledge base a little.

320
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:29,292
Okay.
Thank you.

321
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:31,175
Don't thank me yet.
I'm not gonna make today easy.

322
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,667
I mean, the truth is,
you learn best

323
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:34,027
when you're
a little pissed off.

324
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,855
Do I?
Or are you just trying

325
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,965
to get me to give you
permission to be an ass?

326
00:14:38,317 --> 00:14:39,613
Well, if that's
your attitude,

327
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:41,808
you really don't want my help.
- No, I do.

328
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,816
I-I need it.

329
00:14:43,998 --> 00:14:45,886
Or do I?

330
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:48,191
I don't like that smile.

331
00:14:48,627 --> 00:14:49,675
- That's my smile.
- Mm--

332
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,702
If you're reading into it,
that's on you.

333
00:14:51,727 --> 00:14:52,980
Let's roll.

334
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:56,292
Why do I feel like
I'm making a terrible mistake?

335
00:14:56,325 --> 00:14:58,902
Hey. Whoa!
It is an oven in here.

336
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:00,256
I told you.

337
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:02,894
What if you can't fix it?
- I can fix it.

338
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:05,800
Wedding is almost here.
Are you just so excited?

339
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:07,647
- Totally.
- He just blew a breaker.

340
00:15:07,647 --> 00:15:09,230
I-I got a spare.
Don't worry about it.

341
00:15:09,255 --> 00:15:10,752
I mean, I'm made
of anxiety inside,

342
00:15:10,777 --> 00:15:13,076
but underneath that's
excitement, I think.

343
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:14,433
Well, not to make it
about me,

344
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:16,123
but I just bought a sexy dress,

345
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,067
and I'm ready to party.

346
00:15:18,254 --> 00:15:19,699
Yes.

347
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:22,410
I fixed it
'cause I'm a genius.

348
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,626
And humble.

349
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,472
And icky.
There we go.

350
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,881
All right, back to work.
- To taunt the curse some more.

351
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:28,730
What curse?

352
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,175
Why would you say that
in front of Bailey?

353
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,618
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It's n--it's nothing.

354
00:15:31,643 --> 00:15:34,160
It's a Harper superstition,
curse of the last shift.

355
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:36,236
I--nothing is gonna
go wrong today.

356
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:38,003
Okay?
I promise.

357
00:15:38,343 --> 00:15:40,137
- Whoa.
- Hey. How can I help you?

358
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:42,080
Hi.
Yeah, uh, Josh Randall.

359
00:15:42,105 --> 00:15:44,027
I just bought
the house next door.

360
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:45,902
The police.
Is--is there a problem?

361
00:15:45,927 --> 00:15:47,910
Oh, no, not at all.
I'm Bailey, and this is John.

362
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:49,520
We live here.
- Oh, cool.

363
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,121
I've never had a cop
for a neighbor before.

364
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:53,442
Uh, anyway, I just wanted
to stop by and bring you this.

365
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:54,941
- Oh, that's so nice.
- Very sweet.

366
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:56,402
But we should be
the ones giving you

367
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:57,753
the "welcome
to the neighborhood" bottle.

368
00:15:57,778 --> 00:15:59,597
Well, it's not exactly
a "welcome" bottle.

369
00:15:59,622 --> 00:16:02,291
It's more of a "sorry
for the inconvenience" bottle.

370
00:16:02,316 --> 00:16:03,816
I'm tearing down the house
next door this weekend,

371
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:06,582
and it's possible it might
get a little--little noisy.

372
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:07,707
- No. No, no, no, he ca--
- Okay, no, no, I--I--

373
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:08,609
I got--I got--I got it.

374
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:12,384
We're actually getting married
this weekend--here.

375
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,582
Yikes.

376
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,605
Wish I had brought
a pricier bottle of champagne.

377
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,048
Yeah, we're gonna
have to just

378
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:20,324
push back that demolition.

379
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:21,934
Oh, yeah, totally.

380
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:22,949
But there's no way.

381
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:24,601
Sorry, the permits have
all been pulled,

382
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:25,886
and my contractor
has a super-tight window

383
00:16:25,911 --> 00:16:26,652
to get the work done,

384
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,763
and I'm just not able
to alter my schedule--

385
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:32,039
not <i>not</i> able, just, uh,

386
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,269
you know, not going to.

387
00:16:33,294 --> 00:16:34,962
You get it.
It's what I was gonna do

388
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:37,363
and am gonna do,
but, um, anyway, I'm--

389
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:40,141
oof--just gutted
about the mix-up.

390
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:42,371
It's, um--it'll be
a fun story, right?

391
00:16:42,396 --> 00:16:44,481
"Three bulldozers
at our wedding."

392
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:47,191
Anyway, see you this weekend.

393
00:16:47,287 --> 00:16:50,249
Hoo.
Curse of the last shift.

394
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:56,566
I'm--I'm--I'm gonna--

395
00:16:56,591 --> 00:16:59,218
I'm--I'm--I'm gonna--
I'm just--

396
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:20,335
Welcome back,
Officer Thorsen.

397
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:22,546
Thank you, sir,
and, um, thank you

398
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:24,214
for everything you did for me
while on medical leave.

399
00:17:24,214 --> 00:17:26,769
You're welcome,
but that kindness stopped

400
00:17:26,794 --> 00:17:28,802
when you put that uniform
back on this morning.

401
00:17:28,802 --> 00:17:29,519
Sir?

402
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:30,785
I've been
where you are, son--

403
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,436
trying to come back
after being shot,

404
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,027
almost dying.

405
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:35,723
I would be doing you
no kindness

406
00:17:35,748 --> 00:17:36,793
by coddling you now.

407
00:17:36,893 --> 00:17:38,105
Yes, sir.
Look, I'm--I'm not looking

408
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,381
for any special treatment.
I'm ready to get

409
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:40,866
back on the street
and prove myself.

410
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:42,558
That's not
your decision to make.

411
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,252
I'm assigning you
to station duties

412
00:17:44,277 --> 00:17:46,571
while you start seeing
the department psychiatrist.

413
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:49,074
Only after they approve you
for active duty

414
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:50,517
will I put you back
on the street.

415
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:51,878
Sir, with all due respect,

416
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,300
I'm already seeing
a pretty dope therapist.

417
00:17:54,384 --> 00:17:55,677
I mean,
Lil' Gurkin swears by him.

418
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:57,037
- Who the hell is Lil' Gurkin?
- He's a--

419
00:17:57,062 --> 00:17:58,543
Y-you know what?
I don't care.

420
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:01,082
The department requires you
to see <i>their</i> psychiatrist.

421
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:02,246
You're going.

422
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:04,925
Twice a week.
First appointment's tonight.

423
00:18:08,168 --> 00:18:09,543
- There you are.
- Hey, mama.

424
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:11,277
Welcome back.

425
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,227
You just got a call
from BHPD.

426
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,259
Some guy wrapped
his half-million-dollar Lambo

427
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:17,178
around a tree in Beverly Hills.
- And I care why?

428
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:18,930
Because you had
his fingerprints flagged

429
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,425
in the system
with no name associated.

430
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:21,941
Hot damn.
And where is he now?

431
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,743
Landing at the hospital.
Why? Who is this guy?

432
00:18:23,743 --> 00:18:26,824
We got a hit
on our Federal Reserve crew.

433
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:29,769
- Sir, I would like to go--
- Absolutely not.

434
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,797
MVA with contusions
to forehead,

435
00:18:35,797 --> 00:18:38,633
possible fracture
to left humerus.

436
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:40,093
And one, two, three.

437
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:43,305
Page Dr. Hoffman.
He's gonna need

438
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:45,224
a surgical consult on his arm.

439
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,517
Is my Lambo okay?

440
00:18:46,517 --> 00:18:47,726
It's brand-new.

441
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,228
I just drove it
off the lot today--

442
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,521
And right into a tree.

443
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:51,522
Relax.

444
00:18:54,658 --> 00:18:55,401
Hello.

445
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,361
This is
Detective Harper, LAPD.

446
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:59,238
The man you just brought
into the hospital is wanted

447
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,656
for murder, armed robbery,

448
00:19:00,656 --> 00:19:02,366
<i>and assault
on law-enforcement officers.</i>

449
00:19:02,366 --> 00:19:03,909
<i>He is extremely dangerous.</i>

450
00:19:08,048 --> 00:19:09,717
Oh!

451
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:24,353
What's the situation?

452
00:19:24,378 --> 00:19:26,129
He's got a hostage in there.
She's a nurse.

453
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:28,345
I thought I had a clear shot,
but I hit her.

454
00:19:28,385 --> 00:19:29,087
What kind of weapon
has he got?

455
00:19:29,112 --> 00:19:30,509
It's a blade,
some kind of scalpel.

456
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:31,900
It's Lisa.
She's gut shot.

457
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:33,051
We got to get her
out of there fast.

458
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:34,212
Okay, this is gonna
be tricky.

459
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:35,821
We have no idea who this guy is

460
00:19:35,846 --> 00:19:37,079
or what
his pressure points are.

461
00:19:37,104 --> 00:19:39,368
We push the wrong one,
he could snap and kill her.

462
00:19:39,415 --> 00:19:40,689
We don't got time
to analyze him.

463
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:42,079
I think I can get
a clean shot

464
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:43,658
if Nolan can get him focused
on the door.

465
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,977
If it goes sideways,
I'll take the shot.

466
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,525
All right, do it.

467
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,690
Hey, turn off the lights.

468
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,025
Yes, sir.

469
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:59,090
Sir, this is our first lead
in six weeks.

470
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,142
If he ends up dead--

471
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:01,877
Our priority is
the hostage, always.

472
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:03,011
No, yes, of course, I just--

473
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,162
Sir?

474
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,582
I'm Officer John Nolan, LAPD.

475
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:08,667
We need to talk.

476
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,919
About what, how screwed I am?

477
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,337
Or how you're gonna
offer me a ride

478
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:14,567
to a non-extradition country
if I let the hostage go?

479
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:17,261
I think we should focus on
not making matters any worse.

480
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:18,844
You both need
medical attention.

481
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:20,178
Let me get that for you.

482
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,082
Look, man,
you're a smart guy.

483
00:20:23,107 --> 00:20:25,778
You know there's a deal
to be made if you help us.

484
00:20:25,803 --> 00:20:28,098
Forget it.
I'm not a rat.

485
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:30,689
Even if I was, I'd never
survive long enough for WITSEC.

486
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,482
That's not true.
We can protect you.

487
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:34,067
No, you can't.

488
00:20:36,248 --> 00:20:38,167
You can't.

489
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,653
I should never have bought
that stupid car.

490
00:20:40,761 --> 00:20:42,221
He wa--he warned me.

491
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:46,348
And I'm gonna die.

492
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:48,832
But first,
I'm gonna make it hurt.

493
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,513
- Clear.
- Hey.

494
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,681
Come on!

495
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,433
- Keep pressure on that.
- I know.

496
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,392
Right.
Ready?

497
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,019
Come on.
There we go.

498
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,145
Get her out.
Get her out.

499
00:21:13,732 --> 00:21:15,400
- What now?
- Now we hope

500
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,193
that the address
on his registration is real

501
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,738
and he left something behind
that'll lead us to his crew.

502
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:26,953
Hey, I'm gonna need your
weapon for OIS investigation.

503
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,875
Hey. You okay?

504
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,460
Better than him.

505
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,879
Mm.
Maybe I should have asked

506
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:37,672
Harper or Lopez
to help me study.

507
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:39,424
Eh, Harper's busy
with the task force,

508
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:41,384
and Lopez's cop brain
is just booting up.

509
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,137
Look, the truth is,
all ranked police officers

510
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,555
share the same knowledge base.

511
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:47,223
I mean, sergeant,
lieutenant, detective,

512
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,309
there's only about 8% unique
to each specialty.

513
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:51,478
Yeah, right, but it's that 8%

514
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,104
where Primm will try
and trip me up.

515
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,065
Maybe, but I'd argue

516
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:56,816
that's exactly
what he wants you to think.

517
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,151
Great.

518
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,527
Yeah, thank you
so much for that.

519
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,821
Thank you.
Now I get to play

520
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,157
the second-guessing game
where I spiral out of control

521
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,451
worrying about
whether or not Primm knows

522
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,495
that I think he will try
and trip me up

523
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,455
and that I'm focusing
on the wild cards

524
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,956
while he circles back
to all the stuff

525
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,291
I should be studying,

526
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,710
making me look like an idiot
at the oral exam,

527
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,879
pushing me so far down
the promotions list

528
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:22,170
that even if I do manage
to pass the oral exam...

529
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:26,535
oh, my gosh, I will never
even qualify for an open slot.

530
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,645
This is great.

531
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,100
Great.

532
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,063
Please don't.
- I didn't say anything.

533
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,148
I can hear you.
Y-you're thinking it.

534
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,650
Just--

535
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,235
okay, new idea--

536
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:42,320
unique scenarios
during the day,

537
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,864
study manual at night.

538
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,241
I will sleep when it's over.

539
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,630
- Clear.
- Clear.

540
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,424
Clear.

541
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,968
All right, we're gonna
have to move fast.

542
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,803
Any evidence our suspect
might have left behind

543
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,972
is gonna be useless the very
second his crew finds out

544
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,390
he was killed by cops.

545
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,933
Officer Juarez,
what is our next move?

546
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,101
Well, place is a rental,

547
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,769
clearly not the suspect's
main domicile.

548
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,564
So we tear the house apart
in a top-to-bottom search

549
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:20,358
while trying to avoid provoking
the curse any further.

550
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:22,736
- That's--
- Wh--uh, what curse?

551
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:23,820
It's nothing.

552
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,238
Last shift
before the wedding.

553
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:26,740
Yeah, I don't mess
with curses.

554
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,951
Not since Uncle Cheese
uncovered that ancient tomb.

555
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,036
You can keep your bad juju,

556
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,336
"Final Destination"
karma target away from me.

557
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:36,737
Okay.

558
00:23:36,856 --> 00:23:37,617
Thank you.

559
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:39,313
All right, Officer Juarez,
let's start our search

560
00:23:39,338 --> 00:23:41,602
in the back bedroom,
where you will recite for me

561
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:43,352
the five rules
of a domicile search

562
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:44,508
in backwards
alphabetical order.

563
00:23:44,533 --> 00:23:46,577
Any mistakes you make
will result in a blue page.

564
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:49,242
If you mention the word "curse"
in my presence again,

565
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:51,157
you'll be volunteered
for all the cavity searches

566
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:53,266
at the station from now
until your 30th birthday.

567
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,438
Yes, sir.

568
00:23:54,463 --> 00:23:55,256
Thank you.

569
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:56,778
Clear.

570
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:04,102
7-Metro-100.
I'm on the scene of a 187.

571
00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:05,617
Assigning control
to Officer Chen.

572
00:24:05,642 --> 00:24:07,519
All right, I'm here
as a resource.

573
00:24:07,724 --> 00:24:09,219
But as of now,
you're in charge.

574
00:24:09,244 --> 00:24:10,787
What's your first move?

575
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,375
Crime scene's too small.

576
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,819
Responding officers didn't
recover the murder weapon.

577
00:24:14,994 --> 00:24:17,997
Shooter probably ditched it
somewhere along the block.

578
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:19,194
Make the call.

579
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:22,852
7-Metro-100 requesting
additional units

580
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:25,524
for an expanded crime scene,
canvass, and search grid.

581
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:28,218
Notify Homicide
and mobilize the TID team.

582
00:24:28,506 --> 00:24:30,758
What else?

583
00:24:30,783 --> 00:24:32,828
I mean, there's nothing else
we can do until TID gets here

584
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,813
to document the scene.

585
00:24:34,936 --> 00:24:35,961
Am I missing something?

586
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:37,711
Do you think
you're missing something?

587
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:40,680
I think you're messing
with me.

588
00:24:41,198 --> 00:24:44,688
Un--unless you're not, and
I am really missing something.

589
00:24:45,211 --> 00:24:46,758
All right, well, you've
checked all the obvious boxes,

590
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,961
but there's a wild card.

591
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,938
Do you want me to tell you
what it is?

592
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:50,219
Yes. No.

593
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:52,173
Just let me think for a minute.

594
00:24:52,198 --> 00:24:53,641
All right, pretend
you don't have a minute.

595
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:54,711
What are you missing?

596
00:24:54,736 --> 00:24:55,852
Nothing.

597
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:58,344
Something?
What is it?

598
00:24:58,482 --> 00:24:59,650
No, don't tell me.
Just--

599
00:24:59,712 --> 00:25:00,758
Look, there's no shame
in not knowing

600
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:02,326
the answer, Officer Chen.
- Just let me think

601
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:04,854
for a minute,
Sergeant Bradford, please.

602
00:25:07,228 --> 00:25:09,063
What is that?

603
00:25:11,731 --> 00:25:12,735
The thing you should have
thought of.

604
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,352
No, we have to turn this off.
How are we gonna turn it off?

605
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:16,938
Ugh.

606
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,362
Oh, my gosh.

607
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:24,618
No.

608
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:45,942
Hey.
You need anything?

609
00:25:45,942 --> 00:25:47,250
Uh, no.

610
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:50,813
The union rep is on his way,
and IA is landing in 30.

611
00:25:50,938 --> 00:25:55,227
Having Grey as a witness
is a godsend.

612
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,639
Any one of us would have
taken the shot.

613
00:25:57,654 --> 00:25:59,117
You saved Lisa's life.

614
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,520
I know, but I'm still gonna
have nightmares about it,

615
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:03,255
even though I've been
through it before.

616
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,500
Can I do anything more
to help?

617
00:26:04,525 --> 00:26:06,069
Call James?
- No.

618
00:26:06,094 --> 00:26:08,125
No, not yet.

619
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,318
I know he's gonna be mad at me
for not telling him right away,

620
00:26:10,343 --> 00:26:13,430
but there's a part of him
that is gonna judge me,

621
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:16,336
and I'm just--I'm not ready
to deal with that right now.

622
00:26:16,522 --> 00:26:19,149
I come bearing
burritos and babies.

623
00:26:19,174 --> 00:26:20,842
Ooh, I don't know
which I'm happier to see.

624
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:21,910
Well...

625
00:26:23,274 --> 00:26:25,461
- Don't judge me.
- I would never.

626
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:26,813
I heard what happened.

627
00:26:26,838 --> 00:26:28,924
Sounds like a clean shoot.
- Thank you.

628
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:31,243
Aw, sweet, sweet baby.

629
00:26:31,268 --> 00:26:32,310
First station visit.

630
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:33,753
That is exciting.
- Mm-hmm.

631
00:26:33,778 --> 00:26:36,114
Yeah.
- Here you go.

632
00:26:36,139 --> 00:26:36,969
Aw.

633
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,266
That is so cute.
Thank you.

634
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:40,899
Slow day at the front desk?

635
00:26:40,924 --> 00:26:42,008
- Glacial.
- Mm.

636
00:26:42,092 --> 00:26:42,930
At this point,
I'm looking forward

637
00:26:42,955 --> 00:26:45,195
to department-mandated therapy.
- Mm, don't.

638
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,946
In-house shrinks are
a unique breed.

639
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:49,140
Most are ancient
or uninterested.

640
00:26:49,165 --> 00:26:50,688
And, legally,
they don't work for you.

641
00:26:50,684 --> 00:26:52,436
You got to stay vigilant.
Don't overshare.

642
00:26:52,436 --> 00:26:53,479
Okay.

643
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,008
Uh, excuse me.

644
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,548
That could not have backfired
more spectacularly.

645
00:26:58,573 --> 00:27:00,909
It was a literal clown show.

646
00:27:00,968 --> 00:27:02,594
Hopefully nobody heard
about it.

647
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:12,626
Okay, that's very funny.

648
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:13,837
Thank you.

649
00:27:14,938 --> 00:27:16,469
Hey, welcome back,
Officer Thorsen.

650
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:17,703
Thank you, sir.
It's good to be back.

651
00:27:17,728 --> 00:27:18,876
It's really good to see you.

652
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:21,416
Hey, um, does everybody know
about what happened to me?

653
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,418
Oh, you mean the clown show?

654
00:27:23,418 --> 00:27:25,045
Yeah, everyone.

655
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,379
Um, meanwhile, I ran

656
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:27,714
a background check
on your victim--

657
00:27:27,714 --> 00:27:29,423
Claude Smith, 36,

658
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,993
professional clown/
mime/barista.

659
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:35,329
No priors.
Closest family's in Arizona.

660
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,814
And he lives right around the
corner from where he was shot.

661
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:38,006
Th-that's great.
Thank you so much.

662
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,617
Uh--Wesley, hey.

663
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:42,853
Sorry.
Oh, my gosh.

664
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:44,508
Um, I really need
your professional opinion.

665
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:46,076
Uh-uh.
No, I'm on paternity leave.

666
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,960
Oh, wait, so does that mean

667
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,422
you didn't hear
about my... clown show?

668
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:52,985
No, no, no, I heard.

669
00:27:53,057 --> 00:27:54,579
Your crime scene was
fatally compromised.

670
00:27:54,604 --> 00:27:56,440
The only way for you
to guarantee a conviction

671
00:27:56,465 --> 00:27:58,175
is to get a full confession
from the killer--

672
00:27:58,438 --> 00:27:59,856
that's if you can find them.

673
00:27:59,856 --> 00:28:00,982
So good luck.

674
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:02,929
Great.

675
00:28:02,954 --> 00:28:04,618
Sir, again, I'm--

676
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:08,377
I'm very sorry about focusing
too much on the--

677
00:28:08,713 --> 00:28:10,204
the baseless superstition.

678
00:28:10,229 --> 00:28:13,219
It's just in my DNA
to take these things seriously.

679
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:15,421
Okay, it's not about
taking them seriously.

680
00:28:15,446 --> 00:28:17,376
It's about allowing them
to distract you.

681
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:18,946
You've been on the job
long enough to know

682
00:28:18,971 --> 00:28:21,688
what can happen when you lose
focus, even for a moment.

683
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:23,070
Yes, sir.

684
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:33,987
Whoa. Sir.

685
00:28:35,294 --> 00:28:36,378
Whoa.

686
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:40,993
There's only one number
in the call history.

687
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:42,728
Looks like a daily check-in

688
00:28:43,418 --> 00:28:45,212
at 4:00 p.m.

689
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,209
That gives us
exactly two hours to figure out

690
00:28:47,234 --> 00:28:49,195
what we're gonna do
the next time that phone rings.

691
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:56,548
We got a warrant
on an incoming phone call.

692
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:59,076
Audio and visual tap
of the suspect's phone.

693
00:28:59,923 --> 00:29:00,869
What's that noise?

694
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:02,121
Sounds industrial.

695
00:29:02,121 --> 00:29:03,196
Yeah, or mechanical.

696
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:04,563
Where's the visual?
Do we have it--

697
00:29:04,588 --> 00:29:05,860
Working on it.
It takes a little longer

698
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:08,012
to activate the phone's camera.

699
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:09,433
There we go.

700
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:11,907
They're on a plane.

701
00:29:11,932 --> 00:29:13,517
Yeah, it looks private.

702
00:29:13,758 --> 00:29:15,384
Oh, that's a G550.

703
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:17,852
It's an older model,
2012 maybe.

704
00:29:17,877 --> 00:29:19,743
You can tell that just
by looking at the ceiling?

705
00:29:19,768 --> 00:29:22,396
Let's just say I, uh, spent
some quality horizontal time

706
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:23,881
on one of those
on a trip to Rome

707
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:25,366
with an Italian supermodel.

708
00:29:25,391 --> 00:29:27,810
Don't judge.
- Oh, I'm judging.

709
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,673
Okay, so all we have to do is
figure out where they're flying

710
00:29:29,698 --> 00:29:31,325
and then have law enforcement
waiting for them.

711
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,962
It's impossible to get
a precise location

712
00:29:32,987 --> 00:29:35,031
with a phone that's flying
at 30,000 feet.

713
00:29:35,056 --> 00:29:37,032
But if we can get a rough GPS
when it calls,

714
00:29:37,057 --> 00:29:39,258
they might be able to match it
to the plane's transponder.

715
00:29:39,283 --> 00:29:40,826
I hate to rain
on this parade,

716
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:43,555
but we don't know for sure
that our crew

717
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,843
is on the other end
of that phone.

718
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,620
It could be the hostage taker's
girlfriend,

719
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:48,272
his drug dealer.

720
00:29:48,297 --> 00:29:50,087
We need confirmation
to get an arrest warrant.

721
00:29:50,112 --> 00:29:51,758
We got a more immediate
problem.

722
00:29:51,783 --> 00:29:53,618
That phone is gonna call
this phone in four minutes.

723
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,235
And whoever is on that plane
is gonna know

724
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,204
they're not talking
to their guy.

725
00:29:57,373 --> 00:29:58,583
Unless...

726
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:07,243
Ten seconds.

727
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,712
Right.

728
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,430
Here we go.

729
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:41,493
Yo.

730
00:30:41,782 --> 00:30:42,758
Wow, that thing sounds

731
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:44,326
even more obnoxious
than I thought it would.

732
00:30:44,351 --> 00:30:46,196
Yeah, it kicks ass.
Where are you?

733
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:48,749
Just crossed out
of Mexican airspace.

734
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:50,459
<i>So what'd you find out
about the place?</i>

735
00:30:55,172 --> 00:30:56,465
<i>Banks?</i>

736
00:30:56,465 --> 00:31:00,052
Eh--it--if--ah--money.

737
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:01,887
What?
Banks, you're breaking up.

738
00:31:01,887 --> 00:31:04,598
Wi--he--but--y--if--you--

739
00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:06,142
eh--I--it--uh--

740
00:31:07,643 --> 00:31:10,312
Think he bought it?
- We'll find out.

741
00:31:10,312 --> 00:31:12,523
- Lost him?
- Yeah.

742
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:15,276
But before that,
he sounded weird.

743
00:31:15,276 --> 00:31:17,319
You think something's up?

744
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:19,321
I don't know.

745
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:21,032
But better safe than sorry.

746
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:25,828
- Damn it.
- What's happening?

747
00:31:25,828 --> 00:31:28,414
They destroyed the phone.
They didn't quite buy your act.

748
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:30,583
Did you connect the phone GPS
to the plane transponder?

749
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:31,959
Working on it.

750
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:35,046
Oh.
We got facial matches.

751
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:37,048
He's Boyd Taylor,
and the two women with him

752
00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:39,759
are Cyesha Witt and Kim Loncar.

753
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,552
All have bodies on them

754
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:43,387
in connection with a previous
series of armed robberies

755
00:31:43,387 --> 00:31:45,181
across four states.
- There's our confirmation.

756
00:31:45,181 --> 00:31:46,478
Got the transponder.

757
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:48,922
Jet's flying
from Mexico City to LAX.

758
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:50,384
Wait, they just filed

759
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,923
a new flight plan
to land at Whittier.

760
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:54,201
They're pivoting in case
we're waiting for them at LAX.

761
00:31:54,226 --> 00:31:56,144
Let's mount up, people.

762
00:31:56,269 --> 00:31:58,396
Sir, we should really
sit this one out.

763
00:31:58,421 --> 00:31:59,422
No way.

764
00:31:59,447 --> 00:32:00,782
She's right.

765
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:01,993
It's your last shift.
You should stay here.

766
00:32:02,018 --> 00:32:03,439
Sir, all due respect, no.

767
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:06,467
This guy ambushed my friends
and sent a killer to my house.

768
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:08,911
I need to see this through,
last shift or no.

769
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,204
Okay.

770
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,898
But you're not riding
with us.

771
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:15,657
- Sir--
- No.

772
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:25,634
What are we doing?

773
00:32:26,797 --> 00:32:28,032
Thinking.

774
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,065
Hmm.
Feels like we're sitting.

775
00:32:32,322 --> 00:32:34,345
The search of the victim's
house turned up nothing.

776
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,298
Family and friends gave us
no possible motives

777
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:38,158
for why someone would kill him.

778
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,460
And with no forensics, I--

779
00:32:42,662 --> 00:32:44,664
I think I should skip
the detective's exam.

780
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:46,024
- Lucy.
- I am not ready.

781
00:32:46,062 --> 00:32:47,298
No, you are ready.

782
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,737
Don't let Primm get
in your head.

783
00:32:48,762 --> 00:32:49,954
That ship sailed
this morning.

784
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:51,595
Look, I-I know myself.

785
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,306
If I take this test and I fail,
it'll kill my confidence.

786
00:32:54,331 --> 00:32:55,708
It's just better to wait.

787
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:57,290
Then wait.

788
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:58,954
You know, you can always work
undercover assignments

789
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,564
when on patrol.

790
00:33:00,705 --> 00:33:02,196
So you don't believe
I can pass?

791
00:33:02,221 --> 00:33:04,223
I didn't say that.
I'm just--

792
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,749
I'm just trying
to be supportive.

793
00:33:05,774 --> 00:33:07,642
By telling me
I can't do something?

794
00:33:07,608 --> 00:33:09,402
You're the one that said
you weren't ready.

795
00:33:09,402 --> 00:33:10,845
N--
I-I am in a bad place.

796
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,788
But you just jumped right in
to amplify it.

797
00:33:12,813 --> 00:33:14,148
No, I didn't.

798
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:19,859
Do you hear me?

799
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:22,189
What?

800
00:33:22,482 --> 00:33:23,829
That woman in that car
was crying

801
00:33:23,854 --> 00:33:25,196
while she was looking
at the murder scene.

802
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:26,639
Okay, maybe she knew him.

803
00:33:26,664 --> 00:33:28,457
Or--or maybe she just had
a frustrating fight

804
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:30,401
with her girlfriend.

805
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:55,514
Police.
Show us your hands.

806
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:58,017
Uh, I-I'm not doing anything.

807
00:33:58,042 --> 00:33:59,502
- Ma'am, step aside.
- Come over here.

808
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,709
That--that's not mine.

809
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,767
What about this?
Megan?

810
00:34:21,823 --> 00:34:23,275
I'm guessing you tossed
the gun, didn't realize

811
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,551
you lost your bracelet
along with it?

812
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:32,564
I didn't mean to kill him.

813
00:34:32,589 --> 00:34:35,228
He was--he was gonna tell
my husband about us.

814
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,189
All right, ma'am, face that
way, hands behind your back.

815
00:34:44,535 --> 00:34:45,620
Ow.

816
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:49,679
- Hey, police!
- Show us your hands!

817
00:34:49,704 --> 00:34:51,789
Hands up!
- Hey, freeze, lady!

818
00:34:51,814 --> 00:34:52,940
Whoa! Whoa!

819
00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:56,965
- Turn around, now!
- Turn around!

820
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:07,466
Nolan! Watch out!

821
00:35:15,873 --> 00:35:17,087
You okay?

822
00:35:17,112 --> 00:35:18,931
Uh, yeah.

823
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:20,543
Bet he believes
in curses now.

824
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:21,789
Hmm.

825
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:30,164
Help me understand
something, Boyd.

826
00:35:30,164 --> 00:35:32,375
You're a Picasso
of big-money heists,

827
00:35:32,375 --> 00:35:34,085
planned to the nth degree,

828
00:35:34,085 --> 00:35:36,588
executed with
shocking violence.

829
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:40,174
But this job was different,
wasn't it?

830
00:35:42,218 --> 00:35:44,775
Can I get a soda?

831
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,585
You didn't just break
into the Federal Reserve

832
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,018
and steal hard currency.

833
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:51,352
You hacked their computers,

834
00:35:51,352 --> 00:35:53,896
got into servers
that are beyond secret.

835
00:35:53,896 --> 00:35:55,732
Diet, if you have it.

836
00:35:55,732 --> 00:35:58,217
Someone must have
pointed you to them,

837
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,482
an inside man, one that's
a hell of a lot higher up

838
00:36:00,507 --> 00:36:02,301
than that security guard.

839
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:07,077
You know, I would settle
for a LaCroix--

840
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:08,560
or any sparkling water, really.

841
00:36:08,585 --> 00:36:10,107
This isn't a joke--
you're gonna spend

842
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:12,593
the rest of your life
in an 8-foot cell

843
00:36:12,726 --> 00:36:15,395
till they carry you out
in a 6-foot box.

844
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:17,045
Unless you come clean,

845
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,279
tell us who you were
working with.

846
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,256
Why are you questioning
my client

847
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:26,951
after he called for his lawyer?

848
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,413
- Nobody was asking questions.
- Well, except for me.

849
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:31,145
Seriously, can I get that soda?

850
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:34,548
I'd like to speak
to my client in private--now.

851
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:38,106
Of course.

852
00:36:39,852 --> 00:36:43,262
While you're at it,
I recommend you emphasize

853
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:46,161
how tight the vise is
on his nuts.

854
00:36:46,815 --> 00:36:47,989
Ooh.

855
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:02,051
Hey.

856
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:03,544
Everything go all right
with IA?

857
00:37:03,576 --> 00:37:04,380
Yeah, it was fine.

858
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,323
It should be cleared
in the next day or so.

859
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,005
Good.
Well, I'm--

860
00:37:08,403 --> 00:37:10,559
I'm here if you need me.
- Thanks.

861
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:13,208
- So you survived.
- Yeah.

862
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:15,020
My last shift
is officially over,

863
00:37:15,045 --> 00:37:16,911
and I am still standing.

864
00:37:18,568 --> 00:37:21,739
Why? Why do you insist
on tempting fate?

865
00:37:21,925 --> 00:37:23,481
I think because I know
it upsets you.

866
00:37:23,615 --> 00:37:26,117
Huh.
You're going to hell.

867
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,059
I tried everything,

868
00:37:29,084 --> 00:37:30,336
but they're knocking
that house down

869
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:31,737
this weekend
during our wedding.

870
00:37:31,762 --> 00:37:33,013
We're gonna have
to call it off.

871
00:37:33,038 --> 00:37:34,248
No, no.
God, no.

872
00:37:34,273 --> 00:37:35,184
We're not canceling
the wedding.

873
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,002
Well, then I'm gonna be
the only bride in history

874
00:37:37,027 --> 00:37:39,098
to wear ear protection
with her wedding dress.

875
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,958
Yeah, that's
entirely possible.

876
00:37:40,983 --> 00:37:42,401
I'm so sorry this is happening.

877
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,098
What's happening?

878
00:37:43,123 --> 00:37:47,255
Oh, uh, just our home wedding
is a disaster,

879
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,449
and it's too late
to change the venue.

880
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:51,518
Oh, I mean,
you guys could get married

881
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:54,028
at my family's
spiritual oasis downtown.

882
00:37:54,053 --> 00:37:56,708
Your family has
a spiritual oasis downtown?

883
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,194
He asked him
with great admiration.

884
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,635
Oh, yeah, Zen Gardens.

885
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,950
It's a perfect,
stylish party space.

886
00:38:02,975 --> 00:38:04,810
How many guests?
both: 75.

887
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:05,583
Okay, yeah, no problem.

888
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:07,777
We can handle, like,
five times as many as that.

889
00:38:07,978 --> 00:38:10,939
both: That's...
- So kind of you, Aaron.

890
00:38:10,964 --> 00:38:13,049
But we couldn't ask you to--
- We couldn't?

891
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:15,255
Well, you're not asking.
I'm offering.

892
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,282
And it's the least I could do
for you saving my life.

893
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:18,380
Well, I didn't
save your life.

894
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:20,239
Some very talented
doctors and nurses did.

895
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:21,356
- Bailey.
- I'm just saying.

896
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:23,425
Right, but you got me
to them.

897
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,494
So y'all are getting married
at the Gardens,

898
00:38:25,552 --> 00:38:26,970
and that's the end of that.

899
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:28,224
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

900
00:38:28,249 --> 00:38:29,654
- No problem.
- Now I really am gonna cry.

901
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:30,685
Yeah.

902
00:38:32,072 --> 00:38:33,323
Oh, my God, thank you.

903
00:38:33,914 --> 00:38:35,318
Yo, Ishani.

904
00:38:35,872 --> 00:38:38,249
Hey, what's up dude   ?
This is Aaron.

905
00:38:39,598 --> 00:38:40,466
It's me.

906
00:38:41,881 --> 00:38:44,177
Boyd might be a problem.

907
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:47,122
Yeah, he's facing
life in prison.

908
00:38:47,147 --> 00:38:48,310
If they offer him
a good-enough deal,

909
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:49,753
he's likely to take it.

910
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:55,396
Um, that kind of advice

911
00:38:55,421 --> 00:38:57,089
costs extra.

912
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:00,911
100 grand.

913
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:02,458
Good.

914
00:39:03,184 --> 00:39:06,020
Then my advice is simple.

915
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:10,009
You should do
whatever makes you sleep

916
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:12,255
the most soundly at night.

917
00:39:13,004 --> 00:39:15,132
No, no, thank you.

918
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:20,132
Way to pull off
the fourth-quarter win.

919
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:22,008
Thanks.

920
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:23,083
What?

921
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:25,849
Nothing.
Nothing.

922
00:39:26,688 --> 00:39:29,622
This isn't gonna work
if you're gonna lie to me.

923
00:39:30,113 --> 00:39:31,896
Fine.

924
00:39:31,951 --> 00:39:33,818
Did you undermine me today
because you're scared

925
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:35,396
that I'm gonna make detective?

926
00:39:35,421 --> 00:39:36,599
What? No.

927
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,068
- Tim--
- No.

928
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:40,139
And I'm upset
you'd even think that.

929
00:39:40,405 --> 00:39:42,115
Look, I don't know.
Maybe it wasn't deliberate.

930
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,802
Maybe it was subconscious.

931
00:39:44,211 --> 00:39:45,544
So--so now you're accusing me

932
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:46,862
of being unaware of my actions?

933
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:48,325
That--that's not better.

934
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:50,943
You have to admit that
what happened with Isabel

935
00:39:50,968 --> 00:39:52,511
was deeply traumatic for you.

936
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:54,247
I've never not admitted it.

937
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:55,958
I admitted it
the first day we met, okay?

938
00:39:55,983 --> 00:39:58,307
So the only thing I did today
was have your back.

939
00:39:58,332 --> 00:40:01,627
But i-if you can't see that,
then...

940
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:06,372
You know what?

941
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:08,408
I'm tired.

942
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:09,427
You've got studying to do.

943
00:40:09,452 --> 00:40:12,163
So let's just
take the night off.

944
00:40:12,188 --> 00:40:14,148
All right?
I'll see you tomorrow.

945
00:40:26,975 --> 00:40:28,936
- Officer Thorsen?
- That's me.

946
00:40:30,592 --> 00:40:32,051
Hi.

947
00:40:32,371 --> 00:40:34,315
I'm Dr. London--uh, Blair.

948
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:35,925
I'll be working with you
if that's okay.

949
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,452
Yeah.

950
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:38,987
You seem awesome.

951
00:40:39,313 --> 00:40:41,542
Thanks,
but the jury's still out.

952
00:40:41,753 --> 00:40:43,714
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be joking.

953
00:40:43,987 --> 00:40:46,862
I graduated last year,
and I've been here six months.

954
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:49,308
But I promise,
I do know what I'm doing.

955
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:51,639
Glad one of us does.

956
00:40:52,911 --> 00:40:54,526
This way.

957
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,263
<i>Damn it.</i>
