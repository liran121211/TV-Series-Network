1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:07,070
- These night shifts
have got me tired.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,840
- Well, we've got
four more hours.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,220
Keep it together.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,390
Sorry, it's just,
a week of nights and I--

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,430
I still can't get
my circadian rhythm in line.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,220
And forget about
altering my chronotype

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,750
to maximize sleep efficiency.

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,020
- Well, perhaps
it's for the best,

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,480
seeing as how
we're getting back on days

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,030
now that I finally
paid back everyone

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,200
who covered for me
while I was gone.

12
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,850
Hm.

13
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,060
- Forgetting anything?

14
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,590
- I don't think so.
- You sure?

15
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,310
- 100% sure.
- Good.

16
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,830
How about the suspect?

17
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,350
- ♪ Whoa, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

18
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,600
♪ I'm gonna win for you

19
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,010
♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪

20
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,360
- Hey.

21
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,230
- Hi.

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,980
- Is that a present for me?

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,570
- Yep. And the beer's for me.

24
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,030
- Thank you.

25
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,130
- What?

26
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,590
- Nothing.
I'm--it's just, um,

27
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,380
gift giving isn't really
your love language, so...

28
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,170
- Oh, yeah.

29
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,490
What is my love language?

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,660
- Terse nods, mainly.

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,870
- Okay, well, I'm trying
to change things up.

32
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,350
- Okay.
Well, can I open it now?

33
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,770
- Yeah, of course.

34
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,330
- Oh, my God.

35
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,500
My killed-in-action radio?

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,580
Aww.

37
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,300
That is so sweet.

38
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,570
- Well, it gave its life
for yours,

39
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,030
so I thought it'd be nice
to memorialize your effort

40
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,990
in the Jeff Budny takedown.

41
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:37,100
- Thank you.

42
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,930
- Oops.
I-I forgot it was date night.

43
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,890
I will hide in my room.

44
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,900
- You don't have to do that.

45
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,210
- No, it's my bad.

46
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,070
What smells so good?
- Paella.

47
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,420
You want me to make you a plate

48
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,420
for your room?

49
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,700
- I would say no,
but I'd be lying.

50
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,700
- Yep, Bradford.

51
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,810
Who's this?

52
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,920
Understood.
I'll be there in 20.

53
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,090
- What's going on?

54
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,160
- I gotta go, sorry.

55
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,160
- Just wait--
- I can't.

56
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,330
I'll call you when I can.

57
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,310
- What just happened?

58
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,030
- I don't know.

59
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,170
- Can I do
a vodka soda, please?

60
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,040
Dr. London?

61
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,590
- Hi.

62
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,080
Uh--
- It's okay.

63
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,320
I know, uh, seeing a patient
in the wild is tricky.

64
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,220
- Sorry, I just had
a whole semester

65
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,220
of ethics classes
flash through my mind.

66
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,490
But if you're okay talking
out in the wild...

67
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,190
- Totally. May I?

68
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,330
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,020
So do you live around here?

70
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,890
- No, I actually live
on the West Side.

71
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,540
I just got done seeing a movie
around the corner,

72
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,580
and, uh, came in here
for a little nightcap.

73
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,890
- Drinking alone?

74
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,890
- Yeah, but, you know,
I kind of look at it

75
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,380
as a sign of self-assurance,

76
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,170
not so much a cry for help.

77
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,820
What about you?

78
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,380
- I...I got stood up.

79
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,220
- Who the hell
would stand you up?

80
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,730
I mean, you are a catch
and then some.

81
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,390
- Sorry, that's inappropriate.

82
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,490
- Completely.

83
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,700
But my ego
really appreciated it.

84
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,990
Okay. I should go.

85
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,990
- Yeah.
Or I could buy you a drink.

86
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,470
In a total, like,
patient-doctor kind of way.

87
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,860
- I really shouldn't.

88
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,130
- Right.

89
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,520
- One drink.

90
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,520
- All right, deal.

91
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,720
What you drinking?

92
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,360
- What's up, man?
Thanks for coming.

93
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,530
- I had no choice.

94
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,850
If Ray's alive,
we got a problem.

95
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,050
- He is.
I'm sure.

96
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,200
- How?

97
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,200
They found the tags, his DNA.

98
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,580
We saw the air strike.
There's no one who could have

99
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,890
walked away
from something like that.

100
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,300
- Yeah, that's
what I thought too.

101
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,820
But then a few years ago,
I started hearing stories,

102
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,280
that he was still alive,

103
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,830
working as a gun for hire
around the globe.

104
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,590
So I set up some trip wires
just to be sure.

105
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,110
That's Ray coming
through LAX yesterday.

106
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,520
- What the hell's
he doing here?

107
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,180
- His mom's dying of cancer.

108
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,690
- So she's who
we're staking out?

109
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,660
- Two houses up on the left.
No sign of Ray yet.

110
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,630
- So when did Ray give a crap
about anybody but himself?

111
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,810
- Doesn't matter.

112
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,220
We made a promise.

113
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,640
- That was a long time ago.

114
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,910
- Time doesn't erase
what he did.

115
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,020
Time doesn't bring back
our friends that he killed.

116
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,690
And we made a vow that
if by some miracle he survived,

117
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,230
we'd kill him.

118
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,860
And I am here
to honor that promise.

119
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,380
- Most of these men could be
my dad, some my grandpa.

120
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,110
But I'm supposed to be
some sort of authority figure.

121
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,070
I have cereal for dinner
at least three nights a week.

122
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,530
- Oh. So do I.

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,080
- Mine has
dehydrated marshmallows.

124
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,500
- Okay, see, that is a problem.

125
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,230
I should go.

126
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,570
- Yeah.
Uh, time to call an Uber.

127
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,920
- I mean, I could
give you a ride.

128
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,000
- Really?

129
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,380
- Yeah, it's not a problem.

130
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,380
- Okay.

131
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,340
- Cool.

132
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,660
- This is me.

133
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,700
Thanks for the ride.

134
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,180
- Yeah, no problem.

135
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,600
- Good night.

136
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,410
- 7-Adam-15, multiple callers
report shots fired,

137
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,410
715 Sycamore.

138
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,130
No associated vehicles.
I'll attach two more units.

139
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:47,830
- You got here quick.

140
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
- We were finishing up a call

141
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,380
around the corner,
heard the shots.

142
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,040
- All right, this is
as far as you go.

143
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,670
- We'll stage here
until you Code 4 it.

144
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,180
Be safe.
- Right.

145
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,040
Follow me.

146
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,220
All right, be alert.

147
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,230
I know you're tired.

148
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,330
- Well, not anymore.

149
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,710
Adrenaline is flowing.

150
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,120
- Good. Let's do this.

151
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,500
Juarez.

152
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,640
Go.

153
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,470
- What happened here?

154
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,060
- Control, 7-Adam-15,
two victims, gunshot wounds.

155
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,240
Still clearing house.

156
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,310
I'll take left. Go.

157
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,150
Officer Nolan!

158
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,500
Hey, ambulance
is right outside.

159
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,530
Stay with me.

160
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,710
- 7-Adam-15,
residence is cleared.

161
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,200
Code 4 for fire.

162
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,990
One gunshot wound victim
is unconscious but breathing.

163
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,100
How is she?
- Her pulse is weak.

164
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,100
She could bleed out.

165
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,720
- John?
- Back here.

166
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,730
She's the only one left alive.

167
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,500
You didn't clear the closet?

168
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:39,910
- Uh, no.

169
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,530
- Police. Come out now.

170
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,160
- Oh. Hey.

171
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,330
What are you doing in here?

172
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,680
Come here.
Come here, little one.

173
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,070
What are you doing?

174
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,340
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Hey, look at this.

175
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,730
You don't need
to see that, okay?

176
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,010
- How's the mother?
- Still in surgery.

177
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,210
They're checking in
on the little girl.

178
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,560
No visible injuries.

179
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,980
- Yeah, her first name is Anna,
last name Hughes.

180
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:17,670
Remi's the mom, Ellis the dad,

181
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,190
and the older woman in the
dining room was Grandma Debra.

182
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,430
- You think the girl saw
what happened?

183
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,440
- Oh, I hope not.

184
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,890
She still hasn't said a word.

185
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
- I've been in contact
with CPS.

186
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,020
They are searching for a family
member to come to the hospital

187
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,990
and take custody of Anna
once she's cleared.

188
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,240
- You know, we still have
a whole lot of paperwork to do.

189
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,240
We'll probably stick around,
see how the surgery goes.

190
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,860
- Of course. I'll let you know
if anything changes.

191
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,240
- Thank you.

192
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,900
- Keep me updated
to the minute on this.

193
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,620
A family murdered
in the middle of the night

194
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,490
is gonna keep a lot
of people on edge.

195
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,590
- Yes, sir.

196
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:53,540
Now, about you not searching
the closet.

197
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,850
- There's no excuse, sir.
I-I saw the injured woman,

198
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,160
and I put her as a priority

199
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,640
before I finished
clearing the room.

200
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,920
It won't happen again.

201
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,570
- See that it doesn't.

202
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,510
If that was the shooter
in there instead of a child,

203
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,440
we'd both be dead.

204
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,710
- It's Bradford.
You know what to do.

205
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,540
- Hey, it's me.

206
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,160
Um, no idea
where you are right now,

207
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,550
but, uh, I'm here
if you need me.

208
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,410
So just call me when you can.

209
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,090
- Yeah, there's a back door,
but you gotta go

210
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,570
through the neighbor's yard
to get to it.

211
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,200
And there's no way
to see if Ray's inside.

212
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,920
- And--and if he is?
Then what?

213
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,880
We hog-tie him
and dump him in deep water?

214
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,270
- Well, I was thinking
landfill,

215
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,680
but if you got a boat--
- This isn't funny.

216
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,270
Just talking about this
is criminal conspiracy.

217
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,030
- I never would have thought
the Reaper would go soft on me.

218
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:20,140
- I ain't going soft.

219
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,650
That pact was made
a long time ago

220
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,830
in the anger and fog of war.

221
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,410
But now...

222
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,970
I'm a cop.

223
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,870
You're an army lawyer.

224
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,490
We've built lives.

225
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:31,570
- Yeah, well, what about
Henderson and Coyle?

226
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,360
They never got to build
their lives 'cause of Ray.

227
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,320
They deserve justice.

228
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,640
And we owe that to them.

229
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,570
- You okay?

230
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,030
- I wasn't much older
when my dad died.

231
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,750
Do you think she knows?

232
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,030
- I-I don't know.

233
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,680
Do you think
she'd even understand?

234
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,240
- I don't know.
- Ah.

235
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,580
- Her mother's out of surgery.

236
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,140
She flatlined on the table,

237
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,480
but they were able
to get her back.

238
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,970
She's still very much
in the woods.

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,350
- Any luck finding a relative?

240
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,000
- There's no immediate family
in Los Angeles,

241
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,590
but CPS is gonna widen
the search in the morning.

242
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,870
- So what happens to her now?

243
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,400
- And please don't say
children's shelter.

244
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,020
- For the short term, yes.

245
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,360
And if there's no relative
found, then foster care.

246
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,910
- Those shelters can be grim.

247
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,020
They're chaotic,
underfunded, understaffed.

248
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,220
- I agree.

249
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,820
Not the most ideal place
for a toddler

250
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,890
who just lived through
her family getting slaughtered.

251
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,720
- Give me a second.

252
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,200
I got him.
I'll get him.

253
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,550
Oh, he landed on his butt.

254
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,890
There we go.

255
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,730
He's all better.

256
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,000
Got him?
Here you go.

257
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,180
What do you think?

258
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,140
- About what?

259
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,840
- I'll be right back.

260
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,220
What about Anna staying
with us tonight?

261
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,570
- We aren't registered
foster parents.

262
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,840
It's a process.

263
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,500
- I'm aware,
but we're first responders.

264
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,680
I'm sure CPS would
sign off on it.

265
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,230
Anything's better than
those children's shelters.

266
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,200
- I don't know about that.

267
00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:00,030
- It would be for one night,
or until they find a relative

268
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,060
or a temporary
foster situation.

269
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
But...

270
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,690
- But what?

271
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,870
- Nothing.

272
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,250
You're right.

273
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,560
- You won't regret this.

274
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,700
Luna.

275
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,430
What about Anna coming home
with us tonight?

276
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,050
- I don't see why not.

277
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,390
I'll go start
making some calls,

278
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,470
see if we can make it happen.

279
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,880
- Just like
the good old days, huh?

280
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,340
Staking out a potential target,
hours and hours of nothing.

281
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,680
- Just your bad jokes.

282
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,790
- Hey, those jokes were
me training to be a dad.

283
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,750
I got two now, Scott and Nancy.

284
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,410
Best kids ever.

285
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,870
- Yeah, must take after
their mother.

286
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,420
- We got movement.

287
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,900
- Was that Ray or his mom?

288
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,490
- Let's go find out.

289
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,490
- Hey, you think
that's a good idea?

290
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,780
- What do you want?

291
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,670
- Mrs. Watkins,
I'm Sergeant Tim Bradford.

292
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,200
This is Major Mark Greer.

293
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,370
We'd like to talk to you
about your son.

294
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,000
- Well, he's dead.

295
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,720
What else do you need to know?

296
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,130
- Do you mind if we come inside
for a second to talk?

297
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,410
- I do mind.

298
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,900
- We served with Ray, ma'am.

299
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,760
We just need a moment
of your time.

300
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,900
- Ugh.

301
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,250
Well, make it quick.

302
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,880
I'm not long for this life,

303
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,880
and I don't want to waste
what's left with you two.

304
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,330
- I'm so sorry to hear about

305
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,050
what you've been
going through, ma'am.

306
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,920
I lost my mom to cancer.

307
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,330
- Trust me, she's better off.

308
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,720
- Would you mind
if I use the bathroom?

309
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,890
- Down the hall.

310
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,090
- Thanks.

311
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,900
- Bradford,
you don't need that.

312
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,730
That, uh--

313
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,390
- What's wrong?

314
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,230
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

315
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,910
Yo, Greer.

316
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,640
My God, man, you got old.

317
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,960
- I just told them
you were dead.

318
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,300
Now you made me look
like an idiot.

319
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:48,640
- Calm down.

320
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,030
You don't look like an idiot.

321
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,030
Mom, why don't you, um,
give us a minute, huh?

322
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,660
- You're gonna cry when I die.

323
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:58,900
- We'll see.

324
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:06,150
So...

325
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,390
what are you two doing
at a dead guy's house, huh?

326
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,710
- Bring you to justice.

327
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,400
- Oh, yeah?
For what?

328
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,980
- For starters, being AWOL,

329
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,370
faking your own death,
felony grand theft.

330
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,540
You stole at least $1/2 million
from the U.S. government.

331
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:20,920
- Can you blame me?
I mean, the CIA was giving away

332
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,470
backpacks of cash.

333
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,680
No one was gonna miss it.

334
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,860
- You called in an air strike

335
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,720
on your own guys
when we came for you.

336
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,920
There wasn't enough
of Coyle and Henderson

337
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,000
to fit in a shoebox.

338
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,170
- That sounds really bad.

339
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,520
But I know that's not true.
Do you know how I know that?

340
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,390
Because I read
the after action report

341
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:45,150
that was signed
by the two of you.

342
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,880
- The only reason
the report reads that way

343
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,150
is so that your wife
and daughter

344
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,470
could get your death benefits.

345
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,330
- I never asked for that.

346
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,240
You knew she was about a month
away from "Dear John"-ing me.

347
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,890
But thanks
to your bleeding hearts,

348
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,170
I'm now untouchable.

349
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,720
I mean, you bring me
in right now,

350
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,070
you've got to tell Uncle Sam
about your big lie, right?

351
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,860
And you'll, what,
be retroactively

352
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,320
dishonorably discharged
and most likely

353
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,770
get fired
from your current jobs.

354
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,010
So you can arrest me,
it's okay.

355
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,080
Come on.

356
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,260
Here I am.

357
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,740
No?
Yeah, that's what I thought.

358
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,810
I'm gonna be here
to watch the old lady croak,

359
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,160
and then get back
to what I was doing.

360
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,850
And we are never going
to see each other again.

361
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,070
How does that sound?

362
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,450
Sweet.

363
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Been really great catching up
with my old war buddies.

364
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,150
Greer.

365
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,610
You really do look old as hell.

366
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,720
- That go how you thought
it would, Reaper?

367
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,200
All we accomplished
was letting that guy know

368
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,510
we're coming for him.

369
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,340
Gonna be twice as hard
to take him out now.

370
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,070
- It has been a long time
since I've tucked in a toddler.

371
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,550
- How'd it feel?
- Wonderful.

372
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,660
I do think I tweaked my back
just a little bit.

373
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,550
- Oh, no.

374
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,420
- All right, we are gonna need
to make a list.

375
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,530
- Yes, we are.

376
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,080
We need diapers, baby wipes.

377
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,360
- Food--Cheerios.

378
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,630
Henry loved Cheerios.

379
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,810
Milk--we're out of milk.

380
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,670
- And we need
some baby toys, probably?

381
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,060
- Yeah, definitely toys.

382
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,680
- And we need to do
some babyproofing,

383
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,640
'cause this is dangerous.

384
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,060
- Yeah, okay.

385
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,140
Anything big
should be pulled down.

386
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,930
- Uh, these corners
are really sharp.

387
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,410
- Pointy things, for sure.

388
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,730
I'm regretting
those succulents now.

389
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,660
- How bad do you think this
is gonna screw the kid up?

390
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,250
- Depends on what you saw
and where she goes from here.

391
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,660
- Lila was older than Anna
when she saw me get attacked,

392
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,050
but I always wonder how much
of that stayed with her.

393
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,320
- She's one of the most
well-adjusted kids

394
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,020
I've ever met.
You got no worries there.

395
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,200
- Any clarity on the parents?

396
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,340
- Mom had a suspended sentence
for possession.

397
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,370
Went through a diversion
program successfully

398
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,020
and seems to have been clean.

399
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,920
Father was in and out of jail.

400
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,520
Couple drug cases,
one assault charge.

401
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,520
- Is this their past
coming back?

402
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,140
- Maybe.
Although they seemed

403
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,590
to turn things around
since Anna arrived.

404
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,560
Both parents were employed,
kept their noses clean.

405
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,940
- All right, we should dig
into their financials.

406
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,150
Things might have gotten tight
with the kid in the picture.

407
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,320
Maybe the dad had
to reach back out

408
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,050
to some of his friends
in the drug business.

409
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,710
- Oh, uh, what's that?

410
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,910
- Oh, it's Blair's jacket.

411
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,850
She left it in my car
last night.

412
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,050
Oh, do you mind if we, um, stop
by her office to drop it off?

413
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,160
- Who's Blair?

414
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,820
- My therapist.

415
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,370
- You went out
with your therapist last night?

416
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,830
- No, we ran into each other.
It was just a drink.

417
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,720
Totally innocent.

418
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,520
Although I was picking up
some vibes.

419
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,480
- That crosses so many lines.

420
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,210
You--you know that you're
not supposed to go out

421
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,590
with your therapist, right?

422
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,720
- Well, me and Lil' Gurkin
used to hang out

423
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,930
with Dr. Shrink all the time.

424
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,730
- Lil'--D--
so wait, wait, wait, what?

425
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,530
- Dr. Shrink.
That was my last therapist.

426
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,910
That's just what we called him.
- Okay.

427
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,290
And was this therapist
licensed?

428
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,290
- No.
- What?

429
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,330
- Hey, you think Blair left her
jacket in my car on purpose?

430
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:20,580
Like, to have an excuse
to see me again?

431
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,850
- She does have an excuse
to see you again.

432
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,100
Therapy.

433
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:26,890
Yeah.

434
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,580
- She is adorable.

435
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,760
- She really is.

436
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,860
- You know, when your child
grows up and leaves,

437
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
you don't just miss them.

438
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,730
You miss all
the versions of them

439
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,870
like they're all these separate
individual people.

440
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,080
You miss the--
the infant version,

441
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,800
the toddler version,
the skinny 10-year-old version.

442
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,670
And then the man
that Henry's become.

443
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,630
- That's why people keep
having kids,

444
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,360
to get back to those versions
they miss.

445
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,540
Oh.

446
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,400
They should develop
a time machine.

447
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,470
It'd certainly make
things simpler.

448
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,640
- Mm. And cheaper.

449
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,060
- And cheaper.

450
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,270
Ah, it's Luna.
- Mm.

451
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:06,420
- Hey. Nice to see ya.
- Hey.

452
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,420
- What's--what's wrong?

453
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,070
- Anna's mom, Remi,
she died a little while ago.

454
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,910
- So what happens now?

455
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,460
- We don't have great options.

456
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,260
She'll end up at a shelter
for a week or two

457
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,740
until we can find
a foster family

458
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,990
that will take her in.

459
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,200
Unless--
- Unless what?

460
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,400
- Unless you would be willing
to keep her

461
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,100
until we can place her
with a family.

462
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,580
- What do you think about that?

463
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,070
- I think that's a bad idea.

464
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,000
- Would you give us
a minute, please?

465
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,200
- Of course.

466
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,000
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

467
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,390
- No, not nothing.

468
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:52,010
Any other day,
you are generous to a fault.

469
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,560
- Well, it's--
it's not about that.

470
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,570
I-I want what's best for Anna.

471
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,470
And I think bonding with us
for a few weeks is only gonna

472
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,400
damage her further
on the back end

473
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,670
when, you know,
they pull her away from us.

474
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:05,130
- Okay. Maybe.

475
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,030
But that's not really
why you're hesitating, is it?

476
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,370
- When I was 15,
I was babysitting

477
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,690
for my four-year-old
neighbor, Ryan.

478
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,550
I got distracted for a second.

479
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,730
And when I turned around,
he was in the pool.

480
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,660
I jumped in.
I pulled him out.

481
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,840
He was fine.

482
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,010
But ever since then...

483
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:33,740
I was almost the reason
my neighbors lost their son.

484
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,160
I'm not mom material.

485
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,260
- Okay.
Um, I disagree.

486
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,470
But I understand.

487
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,340
Let's just say goodbye to Anna.

488
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,720
- Wait.

489
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,520
Okay.
- Are you sure?

490
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,280
I don't want to do this
if you're not comfortable.

491
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,070
- How can I make this about me

492
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,180
after everything
she's been through?

493
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,360
Luna, we will take Anna
until you find a family member

494
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,220
or a good foster home.
- That's amazing.

495
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,920
You're amazing for doing this.

496
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,190
- Oh, sorry, this is Wesley.

497
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,820
I'm just gonna grab this.
- Yeah.

498
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:12,710
- Hey, what's up?

499
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,230
- Uh, "what's up?"

500
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,850
it's your deposition today,
Oscar's lawsuit.

501
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,480
- Wesley, I completely forgot.
I am so sorry.

502
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,890
- Okay, I need you to start
putting these things

503
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,820
in your calendar.
- I am.

504
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,030
I did. I have.

505
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,410
It's--it is.
I just--

506
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,210
I-I have so much going on.

507
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,070
- Look, it's clearly
a frivolous case,

508
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,170
but until I can
get it dismissed,

509
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,490
you need
to take this seriously.

510
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,560
- No, you're absolutely right.

511
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,490
I-I am on my way.

512
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,070
Crap.

513
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,010
Oscar's deposition, I forgot.

514
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,080
It should only take
a couple of hours.

515
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,350
I'm so sorry to leave you.

516
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,390
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Are you sure?

517
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,810
I could try
to take her with me.

518
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,220
- Yeah, don't be silly.
We'll be fine.

519
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,710
And I really want
this Oscar situation behind us.

520
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,850
- You and me both.

521
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,380
- Thorsen, Chen,
what's happenin'?

522
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,860
- Smitty, I'm pretty sure
you're not supposed

523
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,930
to be getting in therapy
while you're on shift.

524
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,340
- Oh, I'm not a patient here.

525
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,210
It's where I come
to take my breaks.

526
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,350
Plus, they got
top-notch snackage

527
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,070
and the mood is super zen.

528
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,250
- Yeah, pretty sure
that's not okay either.

529
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,700
- Tomato, to-mah-to.

530
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,460
Snackage.

531
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,840
- That's a new one.
- Yeah, I know.

532
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,220
- Officer Thorsen?

533
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,360
I don't have an appointment
with you today, do I?

534
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,840
- No, I just, uh,
brought you your jacket.

535
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,680
- Oh, you didn't have
to do that.

536
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,920
You could have just brought it
to our next session.

537
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,540
- Thought you might need it.

538
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,470
Never know, it might be
your favorite jacket.

539
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:26,030
Thanks.

540
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,270
That was nice of you.

541
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,650
- Okay.
Well, back to work.

542
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,900
Okay, I'm confused.

543
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,450
- Are you sure she was
flirting with you last night?

544
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,460
- I thought she was.

545
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,630
- Were you drinking?

546
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,520
- I only had one.

547
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,320
- Oh.

548
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,080
- Oh, no.

549
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,220
Am I that guy?
- What?

550
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,250
- The one that thinks
every girl is hitting on him?

551
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,640
- You know who we could ask?

552
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,570
- Who?
- Celina.

553
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,650
- Funny.
- I know.

554
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,030
- Yeah, funny.
- I'm hilarious.

555
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,030
Bye, Smitty.

556
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,200
- We're not killing him.

557
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,650
- You are looking at this
all wrong.

558
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,100
Ray is already dead.

559
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,580
We're just making sure
he stays that way.

560
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,350
- You can hide behind
that idea all you want,

561
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,590
but we both know
it'll give you no comfort

562
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,590
when the nightmares come.

563
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,620
- So what?

564
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,490
We let him get away with it?

565
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,210
- No.

566
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,170
We come clean--
about everything.

567
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,350
- Not a chance.
Ray is right.

568
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,500
We say anything,
it'll blow up our lives.

569
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,570
I will lose my career,
my family.

570
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,190
- I wouldn't let that happen.
I'll take the fall.

571
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,570
I was squad leader.
It'll all be on me.

572
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,500
- I signed those
after action reports too.

573
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,810
- I'll say I made you sign 'em.

574
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:30,160
- No one will buy it!

575
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,370
All right, you are gonna
lose everything,

576
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,200
destroy my life, and then
Ray will still be out there.

577
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,990
There is only one way
out of this.

578
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:42,410
- I can't.

579
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,560
And I won't let you.

580
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,900
- You would arrest me
for killing that scumbag?

581
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,690
- Yes.

582
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,150
- Okay.

583
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,160
Then I'm out.

584
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,060
And whatever death and
destruction Ray causes next,

585
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,820
that's on you.

586
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,140
- Well, it's undisputed
that Officer Nolan wanted

587
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,380
to inflict pain
on Oscar Hutchinson.

588
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,490
- Untrue.

589
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,420
It is very much in dispute.

590
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,140
- Are we keeping you up,
Officer Nolan?

591
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,840
Is my client's life
not important to you?

592
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,420
- Sorry, no.

593
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,740
I've been pulling doubles
lately, and last night,

594
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,840
we took home a little girl
whose family had been murdered.

595
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,190
- Please strike that
from the record.

596
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,330
Officer Nolan is clearly
trying to paint himself

597
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,530
in a positive light
for the court.

598
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,750
- Not at all,
though I can understand

599
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,400
how any act of generosity
you would see as manipulative.

600
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,750
- Let's get back on track.

601
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,270
- Yes. Let's.

602
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,990
Officer Nolan, would you read
the highlighted text exchange

603
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,070
from the day of the attack
on Oscar Hutchinson?

604
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,490
"Why can't this guy just
get shanked in prison?"

605
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,380
- And who did you send
that text to?

606
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,040
- My girlfriend at the time,
Bailey Nune.

607
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,010
- And who were
you referring to?

608
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,530
Who do you wish to see, quote,

609
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,220
"Shanked in prison"?

610
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,260
- I don't wish to see anyone--

611
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,640
- Just answer the question.

612
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:13,160
Who were you referring to
in the text?

613
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,360
- Oscar Hutchinson.

614
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,920
But this was taken
out of context.

615
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,570
- Under what context do
you wish to see my client dead?

616
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,990
And to what lengths
were you willing to go

617
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:21,340
to make sure that happened?

618
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,820
- This is just a man
venting his frustration

619
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,900
about work to his wife.

620
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,350
Nothing more.
- Mm.

621
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,660
Let's move on
to the second text,

622
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,760
shall we, Officer Nolan,
if you please?

623
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,560
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, yes.

624
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,870
This is a cool fort,
don't you think?

625
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,390
- Yes.
- And we can feel

626
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,800
really safe in here, huh?

627
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,840
I love seeing you smile.

628
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,570
You can line 'em all up.

629
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,230
Yes.
Oh, I would love to sit closer.

630
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,580
It's pretty cool in here, huh?

631
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:56,680
- Yeah.

632
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,000
- Yeah.

633
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:05,970
- Oh, good, you're not dead.

634
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,800
- I'm sorry.
- Not good enough.

635
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,590
I've spent the last 36 hours
imagining you bleeding out

636
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,420
at a variety
of Los Angeles landmarks.

637
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,150
- I would have called you
if I could.

638
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,010
- Telling me you're alive
is not optional.

639
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,260
What the hell are you into
that's making you so crazy?

640
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:23,020
- I can't tell you.
- Why?

641
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,370
- Because even knowing about it
would put you at risk

642
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,780
with the department.

643
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,270
- You committed a crime?

644
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,160
- No.

645
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,650
I mean, no, not--
not technically.

646
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:34,590
- But you've done something
that I would be compelled

647
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,420
to report, and if I didn't,
I would get disciplined?

648
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:37,970
- I'm not gonna have
my drama infect you.

649
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,140
- Then what are you doing here?

650
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,660
- I-I came to see you.

651
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:43,830
- And what?

652
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,220
Order take-in?
Watch TV?

653
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,560
Pretend like
nothing's going on?

654
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,910
- No. I--

655
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,670
- If you are not here
to tell me the truth...

656
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,020
I need you to leave.

657
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,060
- Understood.

658
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:11,210
- Hey, how are we doing
on the multiple homicides?

659
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,860
- Yeah, we're coming up
empty so far.

660
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,250
- No eyewitnesses,
not a lot of doorbell cameras

661
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,520
in that neighborhood.
- Yeah, and we talked

662
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,360
to some coworkers,
and they did confirm

663
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,700
that they had turned
their lives around.

664
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,010
- Now a dead end on ballistics.

665
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:25,160
No match.

666
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,540
No hits on any of the prints.

667
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,500
- We should expand
the canvassing area.

668
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:30,600
I'll add some units,
widen the grid.

669
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,400
- Wait, uh,

670
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,000
it looks like the Hughes
got a payment

671
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,060
every third of the month
for $300

672
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,760
like clockwork.

673
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,140
- Drug payments?

674
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,520
Maybe the dad got back
in the game.

675
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,210
- You know a lot of junkies
on a payment plan?

676
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,100
- So...what?

677
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,830
- Rent check?

678
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,700
I mean, they have had
money problems.

679
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:54,420
And that back room
felt different

680
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,530
than the rest of the house.

681
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,040
There were no personal items,

682
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,390
and it had a dead bolt on it.

683
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,020
Maybe they took on a tenant.

684
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,500
- A tenant that disappears

685
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,190
after an entire family
is slaughtered.

686
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,850
- Looks like we have a suspect.

687
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,580
- Hey, I need your help

688
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,170
figuring out what's
going on with Tim.

689
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,820
- Good morning.
- Morning.

690
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,690
Hi, how are you?
I'm fine. Thanks.

691
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,170
Um, that's a lie.

692
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:25,140
Okay, so two nights ago,

693
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,670
Tim got this crazy phone call
and then he disappeared.

694
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,670
Then he called in sick.

695
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,600
And now he says that
if he tells me what's going on,

696
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,220
I could get fired.

697
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,770
- Well, then I--
I guess it's a good thing

698
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,610
he didn't tell you.

699
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,920
- Would you accept
that reasoning from Bailey?

700
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,570
- No.
- Look, if I knew what was

701
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,820
going on, maybe I could help--
we could help.

702
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:43,950
- Right.
But if he won't tell you,

703
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,650
I don't see what choice
you have.

704
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,380
What's going on?
- We ID'd the guy renting

705
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,960
the back bedroom
from the Hughes.

706
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,140
- Midnight shift
brought him in.

707
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,830
- Uh, I have to--
- N-no, of course.

708
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,960
Good luck.
- Okay, you too.

709
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,520
And I'm here if you need me.

710
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:04,360
- All right, we got warm milk,
sound machine.

711
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:07,010
We are ready for nap.

712
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,910
Anna?

713
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,160
Anna?

714
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,160
Sweetie?
Come on out, sweetie.

715
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,890
We're not playing
hide-and-seek.

716
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,830
Anna?

717
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,420
Anna?

718
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,080
Anna. Honey.

719
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,220
Oh, my God.

720
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,230
Where's John?

721
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,130
- Hi, it's John Nolan.

722
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,130
Leave a message at the beep.

723
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,260
- Anna, sweetie.

724
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:02,130
Oh, sweetie.

725
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,970
You had me so scared.

726
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,760
Oh, come here.

727
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:09,170
Oh, sweetie, I was so scared.

728
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,140
Okay.

729
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,980
Oh, it's kind of nice in here.

730
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,800
I actually get why you like it.

731
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,400
- Where were you
night before last?

732
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,980
- Uh, I was at home
with my wife.

733
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,640
You can call her.
She'll tell you.

734
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,930
- What's your relationship
to the Hughes?

735
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,890
- Ellis and I go way back.

736
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,300
Uh, I work in Brentwood,
live in Victorville.

737
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,070
It's about a two-hour drive
on a good day.

738
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,030
I rent a room from them
on the nights that I work late.

739
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,170
But I swear,
I would never hurt them.

740
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,180
- You know what happened?

741
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,420
- It's all over the news.

742
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,830
Is Anna okay?

743
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:45,940
- She's safe.

744
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,080
- Look, I--I know
I should have came forward

745
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,400
and said something, but, look,

746
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,230
I saw what he did to them,
and I was scared.

747
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,740
- He?

748
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,990
- Yeah, Bad Rod.

749
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,580
Ellis won a lottery ticket
a couple days ago,

750
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,960
was bragging how he hit big,
and Rod seemed real interested.

751
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,760
- I couldn't find her.

752
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,070
And suddenly, I was 15 again,

753
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,550
and that little boy
was face down in the pool.

754
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,350
I can't believe I ever thought
I could do this.

755
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,150
- I understand how that trauma
could imprint on you.

756
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,730
But that little boy was okay,

757
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,980
and so is Anna.

758
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:28,770
- I am terrified
I'm gonna fail her.

759
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,120
- We all are.

760
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,580
One time, I accidentally
slammed Dominique's finger

761
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,340
in the sliding glass door.

762
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,920
I can still hear her scream.
- Mm.

763
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,690
- You don't have to be perfect

764
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,760
to take care
of this little girl.

765
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,340
You just have to care enough

766
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:46,380
to get through
the scary moments.

767
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:49,590
But I can take her with me,
if you want.

768
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,550
No judgment whatsoever.

769
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,010
- No. Let her sleep.

770
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,950
- You got this.

771
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,570
- A lottery ticket?

772
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,360
That's why he killed
that little girl's family?

773
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,330
- Not even a lottery ticket,
a scratch-off for $1,500.

774
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,030
- If he's willing to kill
three people for $1,500,

775
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,540
what's he gonna do
to stay out of prison?

776
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,410
- All right, Nolan, Juarez,
you two cover the back.

777
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,480
You three take the front.

778
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,130
If he doesn't go quietly,
we hold the perimeter

779
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,410
and let SWAT do their thing.

780
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:21,380
All right, go.

781
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,000
- Mom's probably been searched
a dozen times,

782
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,580
tired of having a gun
stuck in her face.

783
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,550
You wanna low-key this?

784
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,170
- All right,
we're gonna low-key this.

785
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:57,070
Roderick may not be home,
and we don't want to traumatize

786
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,890
this woman any more
than we have to.

787
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,170
- Roger that.
We're in position.

788
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,690
No movement in the house.

789
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,920
- LAPD. Mrs. Eaves?

790
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,470
- We have a search warrant
for this house

791
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,990
and an arrest warrant
for Roderick Eaves.

792
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,020
- He's not here.

793
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,580
That's what that sign says.

794
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:21,200
I haven't seen or heard
from him in months.

795
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,470
So don't go tearing up
my house.

796
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,750
- A search warrant
isn't a choice, ma'am.

797
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,830
Please step outside.

798
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,890
- Uh, floor gets creaky
after I vacuum.

799
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:31,860
- Yeah, that's not a thing.

800
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,760
Come here.

801
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,150
We have movement inside.

802
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,530
Perimeter hold.
We are making entry.

803
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,880
What the hell is he shooting?

804
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,980
- High-velocity slug rounds.

805
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:46,530
Control, we have
a barricaded suspect

806
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,050
with some type of long gun.

807
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,510
Send SWAT to our location.

808
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,400
- I got an open window.
You want tear gas?

809
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
- Do it.

810
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,730
- Cover me.

811
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,590
- Clear.

812
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,870
Control, Code 4.

813
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,180
We have suspect in custody.

814
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,020
Mobilize an RA unit for a GSW.

815
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:52,810
- All right.
Everyone okay?

816
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,190
- All in one piece.

817
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,290
- Hey, hey.
You okay?

818
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,920
Heard it got a little dicey
out there today.

819
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,500
- Oh, yeah.
A bit of a soup sandwich,

820
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,200
but we all came out all right.

821
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,160
- All over
a scratch-off ticket?

822
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,750
Yeah.

823
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,480
Oh, hey, I got
some good news for you.

824
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,060
- Oscar died?

825
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,900
- You have to stop
joking like that.

826
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,000
- Even though he stabbed you?

827
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,410
- Yeah, fair enough.

828
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,210
A judge granted
the motion to dismiss.

829
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,310
- So it's over?
- For you.

830
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,210
The judge said you had
the lowest tier of culpability.

831
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,840
The sheriff stationed
outside the hospital room

832
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,040
was primarily responsible
for Oscar's safety.

833
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,220
- Wesley, that is great.
- Yeah.

834
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,870
- Thank you.
- I'd say get some sleep,

835
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,080
but I know you got a toddler

836
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,230
at your house, so--
- Oh, yeah, no.

837
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,020
Sleep is out the window.
- Ooh, yeah.

838
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,050
- I need to clear the air
on something.

839
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,890
Um, look, the other night--

840
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,200
- Totally my fault.

841
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,340
I should never have said yes
to that drink.

842
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,820
It was a violation of
our professional relationships,

843
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,240
and I could get
into a lot of trouble.

844
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,380
- T-trust me, you won't.
I would never narc you out.

845
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,170
- I know that,
but I never should have

846
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,660
put you in a position
to make that choice.

847
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:55,070
I understand if you want
to switch therapists.

848
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,250
- No.

849
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,070
No, not at all.

850
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,460
Look, you are the first person

851
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,300
that I've ever felt
comfortable opening up to,

852
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,640
and I can't lose that.

853
00:37:06,670 --> 00:37:08,290
You know, so no matter the--

854
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:10,330
the physical attraction
we felt--

855
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:12,720
- Aaron.

856
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,510
I need to make this very clear.

857
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,650
There was and is no attraction
on my end.

858
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,110
I need you to understand that.

859
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,180
- Understood. Yeah.

860
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:29,080
Uh, glad we cleared the air
on that.

861
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,250
See you next session.

862
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,250
- Have a good week.

863
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,870
- Thank you.
You too.

864
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,680
- What are you doing?

865
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,890
- Nothing.
I am not calling,

866
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,820
not searching, not stalking.

867
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,830
I'm just being a good
girlfriend and trusting my man.

868
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,280
- Worst country song ever.

869
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,550
Still no word?

870
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,730
- I mean, we talked last night.

871
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,210
- That's good.

872
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,980
- More like I got heated
and he just stood there,

873
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,560
so I don't know.

874
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,180
I'm at a loss.
- I've got an idea.

875
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,840
Let's put a tracker
on his truck.

876
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,320
- You--you are
a bad influence.

877
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,910
- No. You're just
a really good teacher.

878
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,540
- Wh-what?

879
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,990
- You think I haven't learned
a thing or two

880
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,020
living with a cop
who aced undercover school?

881
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,410
- Okay.
What have you learned?

882
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,030
- Never hold your coffee
with your gun hand.

883
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,820
- Yes, that is actually
very useful.

884
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,200
However, you do not have a gun.

885
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,340
So what else?

886
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,890
- Keep your head on a swivel.

887
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,240
- What is this?

888
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:31,820
Oh, balance.

889
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,830
Good.

890
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,360
- ♪ In my prayer,
I don't speak ♪

891
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:47,220
♪ But with my hands
and on my knees ♪

892
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,580
♪ When I ask, I receive

893
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,480
♪ Don't play fair,
don't be sweet ♪

894
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:00,270
♪ It's in the air
that I breathe ♪

895
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,340
♪ Understand it's
up my sleeve ♪

896
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,010
♪ Well, in my head,
it's in my sleep ♪

897
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,080
♪ With my hands, in my teeth

898
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,460
- Oh, my gosh.

899
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,220
I love what you've done here.

900
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:18,500
I see a pig,
but I also see a cat.

901
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,880
More of a pig-cat.

902
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,390
Kind of brilliant.

903
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,400
She's brilliant.

904
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,220
- Okay.

905
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,530
- Pardon me.

906
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,890
- Let's do it.

907
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,890
- Do what?
- Foster her.

908
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,510
I know we decided not
to have kids,

909
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,090
but this feels like fate.

910
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,510
- Yeah. No, it does.

911
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,070
Are y--are you sure
you're all right with this?

912
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,100
- Yeah.
I-I-I mean, I'm terrified,

913
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,590
but I can run
into burning buildings.

914
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,900
I can do this.

915
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,350
- Of course you can.
This is gonna be great.

916
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,800
- Yes.
- This is gonna be so great.

917
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,830
- Yes.

918
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,040
both: Hi.
- Come in.

919
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,050
Hi.
- Great news.

920
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,700
John, Bailey,
this is Don Hughes,

921
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,330
Anna's uncle from Tampa.

922
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,220
- Oh, great to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

923
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,020
- He's gonna take Anna
to live with him.

924
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:02,330
- That's--that's fantastic.

925
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,650
- Yeah.

926
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,680
- Thank you so much
for taking care of her.

927
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,850
- Oh, no, of course. Yeah.

928
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,340
- She's amazing.
- Yeah, she's been great.

929
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:12,930
- Hey, sweetheart.

930
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,510
How you doing?

931
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:17,140
- Aw.
- Aw. Fantastic.

932
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:20,970
This is goodbye,
so high fives, little one.

933
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,800
- Bye, sweetie.

934
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,250
Yeah.

935
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,830
- Let me get her settled
in the rental.

936
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,460
I'm gonna head right
to the airport.

937
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,040
- Okay.
- Come on.

938
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,880
Ready?

939
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,990
- You both did an amazing job.

940
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,760
I can't thank you enough.

941
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,080
- You okay?

942
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,390
- No.

943
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,940
- Yeah, me too.

944
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:40,080
- Damn it.
