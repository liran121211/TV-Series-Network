1
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:10,921
Dispatch said
it was a noise complaint?

2
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:11,617
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:12,929
And they requested
us specifically?

4
00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:15,128
That's what she said.

5
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:16,362
I guess we missed it.

6
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:48,113
This would be
a great opportunity

7
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:50,451
to teach me about de-escalating
in policing.

8
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:45,409
Imagine my surprise
when reviewing

9
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,896
last week's bodycam footage
and I saw...

10
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:52,278
this.

11
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,314
No. Yes, sir.

12
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,143
I, uh--well, I--

13
00:01:55,143 --> 00:01:57,248
I can explain.
It's...

14
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,087
I'm waiting.

15
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:15,071
Wake up, lazybones.

16
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:15,860
We're gettin' married tomorrow,

17
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,451
and there is a buttload
to get done.

18
00:02:17,476 --> 00:02:19,063
Uh, I'm not feeling
very good.

19
00:02:19,088 --> 00:02:20,434
- What?
- Yeah, my head.

20
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:21,583
- What's going on?
- Maybe--

21
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,033
Oh, sucker!

22
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:25,035
- You faker.
- Yeah.

23
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:27,624
Listen, this is important.

24
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:29,280
We're getting married tomorrow.

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,799
I know.
I already said that.

26
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:32,042
Yeah, I just felt
like it needed

27
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:33,561
a little extra attention.

28
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,460
Get your ass out of bed.
- Yes, boss.

29
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,703
We need to go meet
the wedding planner.

30
00:02:37,703 --> 00:02:38,773
Yes, boss.

31
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:52,890
Henry, hi.

32
00:02:54,789 --> 00:02:56,100
Hey, Bailey.

33
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,447
<i>Are you getting
on your flight?</i>

34
00:02:57,447 --> 00:02:59,103
No.
Uh, a little hiccup.

35
00:02:59,103 --> 00:03:00,484
My flight got canceled.

36
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:03,418
Technically, the entire airline
went bankrupt, so...

37
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:04,799
Okay, well,
we're just gonna have

38
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:05,903
to get you on another flight.

39
00:03:05,903 --> 00:03:07,871
I tried, but there are
none available

40
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,597
that'll get me there
in time for the wedding.

41
00:03:09,597 --> 00:03:11,944
- Who are you talking to?
- Uh, the firehouse.

42
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:13,186
We are not gonna tell
your dad about this

43
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,534
because I don't want him
to worry.

44
00:03:15,534 --> 00:03:17,881
<i>Okay, I need you to get
to the train station.</i>

45
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:19,883
It looks like there's
a few flights out of Haneda

46
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:21,125
that would get you here
in time,

47
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,541
but you need to make
the next bullet train.

48
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,370
On it.
Thanks for the assist.

49
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,303
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, totally.

50
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:27,580
They couldn't find something,

51
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,271
so instead of actually looking,
they call me.

52
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:30,997
- Men.
- Tell me about it.

53
00:03:30,997 --> 00:03:32,378
- Shall we plan a wedding?
- Yes.

54
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:35,968
- Oh, Chastity, hi!
- Oh.

55
00:03:35,968 --> 00:03:37,383
Pete. Not Pete. Randy.

56
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,454
Oh, hello,
mein bestest Freund.

57
00:03:39,454 --> 00:03:41,629
Oh, wow.
Funniest of stories.

58
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:44,045
So when
I skip-tracer-bounty-hunted

59
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:46,944
Mr. Peter yesterday,
he begged me not to take him in

60
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:49,222
because of your upcoming
marital consummation.

61
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:51,293
Skip traced for what?

62
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:53,226
Outstanding warrant.

63
00:03:53,226 --> 00:03:55,056
6,000
in unpaid parking tickets.

64
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,471
- 6,000?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:57,990
Yeah, when I told him
I took a vow

66
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,717
as a law enforcement officer
not to accept bribes,

67
00:04:00,717 --> 00:04:03,478
he made me promise to go
to your wedding in his place.

68
00:04:03,478 --> 00:04:06,308
And have sexy time
with his girlfriend?

69
00:04:06,308 --> 00:04:07,931
Oh, just
over-the-clothes stuff.

70
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,796
I'm teaching Randy here
how to be a better kisser.

71
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:12,798
Oh, she is very good.
Allow me to share her skills.

72
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:14,316
- No. No.
- Oh, that's okay.

73
00:04:14,316 --> 00:04:16,457
We're actually running late
to meet the wedding planners.

74
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,562
Well, this is insane,
to be honest.

75
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:19,598
But we've really gotta go.

76
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:20,909
So the guest room
is ready to go.

77
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:22,497
Please stay out of trouble.

78
00:04:22,497 --> 00:04:24,603
You are no fun,
but you will be tonight

79
00:04:24,603 --> 00:04:25,983
at your bachelor party.

80
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,053
No bachelor party.

81
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:28,330
I told you--I told Pete.

82
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,263
Oh, yeah, and he said,
"Well, I can't believe

83
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:32,576
"we are related, half-bro.

84
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:34,336
Pound."
- Nailed it.

85
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:37,478
But while I am so glad
that you are here,

86
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:38,962
I, in no way, agree
to participate

87
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,757
in this bizarre
brother-swap thing,

88
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:42,310
so you can cut that out...
- Okay.

89
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,761
You can have a lovely day,
and you can come with me.

90
00:04:44,761 --> 00:04:45,762
- Yes.
- Thank you, guys.

91
00:04:45,762 --> 00:04:48,040
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

92
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,663
- Okay, we are alone.
- Yeah.

93
00:04:50,663 --> 00:04:52,562
What would Mr. Peter do?

94
00:04:52,562 --> 00:04:55,392
Um...

95
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:58,153
mm.

96
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:02,675
Role-play.
- Yes.

97
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:04,539
I will be Marlene Dietrich.

98
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,541
You will be Marty McFly,

99
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:09,993
teaming up with Mr. Frodo
to help him get to Mordor.

100
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:12,133
- Thank you for breakfast.
- Of course.

101
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:13,928
But you didn't have
to walk me home.

102
00:05:13,928 --> 00:05:15,999
I didn't.
I came to check on Aaron.

103
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:17,138
Oh. All right.

104
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:18,588
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

105
00:05:18,588 --> 00:05:21,038
Remember, I have book group,
so I'll be home late.

106
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:22,419
You just had book group.

107
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:23,903
How many books
do you guys read a week?

108
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,353
Two or three.

109
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:28,321
Now where can I find Aaron?

110
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:29,633
Thank you.
Bye, baby.

111
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:30,807
- Bye, baby.
- Mwah.

112
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:39,229
And turn to the right.

113
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,026
Wish we had
a better lighting setup,

114
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:46,029
but this tells a story.

115
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,030
Hi.

116
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,307
Mrs. Grey, hey.

117
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,826
How you feeling?

118
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:52,345
Good. Great.

119
00:05:52,345 --> 00:05:54,796
Wish I could just
get back out there.

120
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:56,246
I understand.

121
00:05:56,246 --> 00:05:57,247
But don't rush.

122
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:58,731
No matter what Wade might say,

123
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:00,146
it took him a while
to get himself right

124
00:06:00,146 --> 00:06:01,734
after he was shot.

125
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,391
No one's gonna judge you
negatively.

126
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,010
Appreciate that.
Thanks.

127
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:13,712
Well, I'm gonna get going.

128
00:06:13,712 --> 00:06:16,646
Of course.
Thanks for checking in. Yeah.

129
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:21,651
Hey.
- Hey.

130
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:24,205
- You have a sec?
- Sure.

131
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:26,241
No.
Sorry, we gotta get out there.

132
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,311
Everything all right?

133
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:31,453
Yeah. Uh, totally.
It can wait.

134
00:06:31,453 --> 00:06:33,110
Get your ass in the shop.

135
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,079
You are driving while
I figure out your new nickname.

136
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,116
Yes, ma'am.

137
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:41,360
- Got a minute to talk?
- Uh, sure.

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,982
There's nothing to talk about.

139
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:44,570
You felt I undermined you
at a crime scene

140
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,916
to stop you
from making detective.

141
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,193
I explained that I didn't.

142
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:48,747
Now we're moving on.
- Okay.

143
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:50,369
Well, while I appreciate
the efficiency,

144
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,337
that's not how actual
healthy communication works.

145
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:55,892
Wow, that's not
condescending at all.

146
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:57,445
Explain to me
what there is to talk about

147
00:06:57,445 --> 00:06:58,619
that isn't just a retread

148
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,068
of what
I just efficiently covered?

149
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:03,002
Well... that's not the point.

150
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:05,418
Look, if I have to start

151
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:07,006
another deep undercover
assignment,

152
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,905
there are real issues here
that we need to talk about.

153
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:12,322
Which we will deal with
if they come up then.

154
00:07:12,322 --> 00:07:14,048
I gotta get to work.

155
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:15,463
Have a good shift.

156
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,226
<i>This is a problem.</i>

157
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:21,814
It's amazing
you got it last-minute,

158
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:24,575
but it's so much more
than a home wedding.

159
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:27,130
- And by more, you mean...
- Expensive.

160
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:29,304
If we bring the same game plan
here as your house,

161
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:30,996
it'll look cheap and low-rent.

162
00:07:30,996 --> 00:07:34,275
So we have to up everything--
flowers, catering.

163
00:07:34,275 --> 00:07:36,657
I'm a little worried about
how stressed out you seem.

164
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,244
Sorry, it's been a morning.

165
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:40,453
My girlfriend is cheating,
and my assistant quit.

166
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:42,110
- Well, we're happy to help.
- Great.

167
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,836
I need you to go
give Be-Bop $1,000.

168
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:45,458
- Love it. Who's Be-Bop?
- Our DJ.

169
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,184
I am so sorry,
I just have to take this quick.

170
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:48,599
Hey, what's up?

171
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,671
- Where are you?
- I'm doing wedding stuff.

172
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:51,844
You forgot about
the deposition.

173
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:54,329
I forgot about
the deposition.

174
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:56,159
You have to get me out of that.
There's so much to do.

175
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,263
I'm getting married tomorrow.

176
00:07:57,263 --> 00:07:58,782
Look, I get it,
but Judge Scott was born

177
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:00,335
without sympathy.

178
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:01,992
Wesley.

179
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:04,512
Looking sharp.

180
00:08:04,512 --> 00:08:07,239
Sharp.
- Ha.

181
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:09,620
I can try to get Oscar's lawyer
to agree to a continuance,

182
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,898
but only when you're here.

183
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:12,658
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

184
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,935
Be where in 20?

185
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:15,696
It's a surprise,
but I will meet you

186
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:16,869
at the DJ's house.
- Uh--

187
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:20,848
Okay, no problem.
- Gotcha.

188
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:23,945
Henry.
Hey, what's happenin'?

189
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:25,395
You missed the bullet train.

190
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:27,362
Uh-huh.
Those things go quick.

191
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:30,469
Okay, just give me a second
to figure out a plan C.

192
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,815
You have always hated him.

193
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,852
He won't stop barking.

194
00:08:35,094 --> 00:08:37,096
You take point, Miss Cleo.

195
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:39,650
Mi--oh, right, the psychic.
Good one.

196
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,066
Who called 911?

197
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:44,000
That was me, because
this bitch poisoned my dog.

198
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,242
I did not.

199
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:46,830
Can I take a look at him?

200
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,073
Yeah, of course.
He's a sweetheart.

201
00:08:48,073 --> 00:08:50,040
He's a menace.

202
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,526
But I didn't hurt him, I swear.
- Mm.

203
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:56,253
It's okay.

204
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:01,949
It looks like he was chewing
on your planter.

205
00:09:01,949 --> 00:09:03,847
Detective,
can you look at this?

206
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:06,574
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

207
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:12,476
Um, where did you get
this flowerpot?

208
00:09:12,476 --> 00:09:14,478
The farmers market
last weekend.

209
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:15,617
Why?

210
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:17,171
Okay, we need
to have it tested.

211
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:18,897
Officer Juarez will
give you a receipt.

212
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:20,346
You need to take your dog
to the vet

213
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:22,970
and let them know that he might
have ingested a narcotic.

214
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,350
- Wesley.
- John-O.

215
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,766
It's great to see you.

216
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:26,905
I'm sorry for upsetting

217
00:09:26,905 --> 00:09:28,769
and disrupting
your upcoming nuptials.

218
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,356
Although truth be told,
I'm a little hurt

219
00:09:30,356 --> 00:09:31,633
I didn't get the invite.

220
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:32,807
Is that why you're suing me?

221
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:33,877
No.

222
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,672
I'm suing you
for gross negligence

223
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:39,158
in allowing my injury while
selflessly donating a kidney.

224
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:40,608
Oh, Oscar,
you are so full of--

225
00:09:40,608 --> 00:09:44,474
Don't talk
to my client like that.

226
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:45,475
Monica.

227
00:09:45,475 --> 00:09:47,270
Good morning.

228
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,203
I'm taking over
Mr. Hutchinson's case.

229
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:52,171
Substitution of counsel
has been filed with the court.

230
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:53,483
Let's get started.

231
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:55,796
You're in trouble now.

232
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:57,901
Aaron.
Look, I'm sorry about earlier.

233
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,282
You know how judgy
Harper can be,

234
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:01,456
and I really need
to impress her.

235
00:10:01,456 --> 00:10:02,664
You okay?
- Yeah.

236
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:06,530
Just, um, having a hard day.

237
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,669
It's okay.

238
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:08,843
You're safe.

239
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:11,121
Boot, I thought
you were going to 10-1.

240
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:12,778
No, yes, ma'am.
I'll be out there in five.

241
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,643
Make it two.

242
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:18,439
So how's it going
with the department shrink?

243
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:19,474
Good.

244
00:10:19,474 --> 00:10:20,924
Should be cleared any day now.

245
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,201
Mm-hmm.

246
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:33,178
Officer Lucy Chen, wow.
How fortunate to find you here.

247
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:35,421
Uh, fortunate for who?

248
00:10:35,421 --> 00:10:38,459
We have ein winzig problem
and need a little help.

249
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,633
Randy pawned
Bailey's wedding ring.

250
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:42,704
What?
Why would you do that?

251
00:10:42,704 --> 00:10:45,259
I was role-playing as Pete
and got a little carried away.

252
00:10:45,259 --> 00:10:47,295
And unfortunately,
before I could buy it back,

253
00:10:47,295 --> 00:10:49,435
a murderous-looking man
bought it out from under me.

254
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:51,506
So we really need you to,
um--

255
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:53,819
- Get it back?
- Exactly. Wow!

256
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,925
See, I told you we have come
to the right location.

257
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:58,444
Mm, please help us.

258
00:10:58,444 --> 00:10:59,894
Immediately.

259
00:11:01,597 --> 00:11:02,943
Oh, hey.

260
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:05,808
Do you have any leverage
with a felon called The Hammer?

261
00:11:05,808 --> 00:11:07,016
No, why?

262
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:09,018
Okay, so Skip Tracer Randy
was role-playing

263
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:10,226
as Nolan's brother Pete,

264
00:11:10,226 --> 00:11:12,539
and he pawned
Bailey's wedding ring,

265
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,161
and The Hammer bought it.

266
00:11:14,161 --> 00:11:16,163
Nothing about that sentence
makes sense.

267
00:11:16,163 --> 00:11:17,613
I've run The Hammer before.

268
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:19,719
You want no part
of his craziness.

269
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:21,859
Yet I still told Randy

270
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:23,585
that I would try and get it
for him, so...

271
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:24,965
I'll go with you.

272
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:27,278
No.
Please don't do me any favors.

273
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:28,590
- Seriously?
- Hmm?

274
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,074
I knew you weren't gonna
be able to let it go.

275
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:31,662
I have completely let it go.

276
00:11:31,662 --> 00:11:32,939
Let what go?

277
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:34,941
both: Nothing.

278
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,528
Okay, do you want
my help or not?

279
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,565
I don't need it,
but I will accept it.

280
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,704
- Fine.
- Good.

281
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:40,843
- Whatever.
- Great.

282
00:11:40,843 --> 00:11:42,086
- Let's go.
- Maybe I'll go too.

283
00:11:42,086 --> 00:11:44,088
Grab some popcorn on the way
for the show.

284
00:11:44,088 --> 00:11:45,986
- You're not funny.
- I'm hysterical.

285
00:11:45,986 --> 00:11:47,367
Ask Wesley.

286
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:49,265
Failure to protect my client
is a violation

287
00:11:49,265 --> 00:11:52,199
of the Eighth Amendment,
not to mention depriving him

288
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:55,064
of minimal civilized measures
of life's necessities.

289
00:11:55,064 --> 00:11:57,377
- He got takeout.
- I got assaulted.

290
00:11:57,377 --> 00:11:58,447
And you let it happen.

291
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:00,035
Look, I don't have time
for this.

292
00:12:00,035 --> 00:12:01,968
How about a little bit
of human decency here, Monica?

293
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:03,659
Officer Nolan has a wedding
to get ready for.

294
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:05,109
If you agree
to the continuance,

295
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:06,110
the judge will sign off.

296
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,283
Happy to.

297
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:09,285
If Officer Nolan
turns over his phone.

298
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:10,286
- What?
- No, no, no.

299
00:12:10,286 --> 00:12:11,287
That is ridiculous.

300
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:12,703
His phone contains evidence

301
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:15,084
in texts, photos, and notes
consistent

302
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:17,949
with a cruel indifference
to my client's suffering.

303
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:19,295
No, it doesn't.

304
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:23,403
And I worry that he will
destroy that evidence

305
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:24,611
if given the opportunity.

306
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,888
Okay, there is no nexus
between

307
00:12:25,888 --> 00:12:27,131
the plaintiff's
alleged discomfort

308
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:28,270
and Officer Nolan's phone.

309
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,099
And any such intrusion
is so vast

310
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:31,618
that only a special master
should be allowed

311
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,102
to review the contents
of that phone.

312
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:34,656
Then it looks like
we're spending the day here.

313
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:36,002
No, I-I can't.

314
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:38,107
Just--look, I'm gonna
give Wesley my phone.

315
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:41,248
The judge can decide
what to share.

316
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,034
Great seeing you, John.

317
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:44,508
Congratulations.

318
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:47,389
I just need
to write down one address.

319
00:12:47,414 --> 00:12:48,518
<i>Why didn't you answer
my call?</i>

320
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:50,649
- Uh, lost my phone.
- What? Where?

321
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:52,438
At the surprise place.

322
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,578
John, the next 24 hours
are gonna hit us

323
00:12:54,603 --> 00:12:55,789
at 100 miles an hour.

324
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:56,961
I need you to have a phone.

325
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:58,313
No. Yeah. I know.
Don't worry.

326
00:12:58,338 --> 00:13:00,094
I'm gonna get one right after
we're finished here.

327
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:00,992
I won't skip a beat.

328
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:02,200
Okay.

329
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:05,883
- Who is it?
- John Nolan.

330
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:07,400
You're gonna DJ
our wedding tomorrow.

331
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,939
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's open. Come on in.

332
00:13:12,994 --> 00:13:15,099
Oh.

333
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:16,618
Hey, what's up?

334
00:13:16,618 --> 00:13:18,378
Listen, I've been thinking
a lot about your gig

335
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:20,311
because I know
that you said you wanted me

336
00:13:20,311 --> 00:13:22,969
to lean into, like,
a '90s Janet vibe or whatever.

337
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,247
But I just got
this old Nordic go-go disk.

338
00:13:25,247 --> 00:13:26,559
You gotta check this out
because I really think

339
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,663
this is gonna set--
- Oh.

340
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:28,768
You know switchblades
are illegal

341
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:30,218
in the state of California, right?

342
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:31,288
- Really?
- Yeah.

343
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:33,876
It's a violation
of Penal Code 21510,

344
00:13:33,876 --> 00:13:35,740
but I can ignore that.

345
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,294
We're just here to give you
the cash for the gig.

346
00:13:37,294 --> 00:13:39,503
Hey, what's up?
No. No, no, no.

347
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:40,918
You tell him
that he's gotta pay up.

348
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:43,472
I boosted those kicks
'cause he said he wanted them.

349
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:45,336
Do I look like I have
size 7 feet to you?

350
00:13:45,336 --> 00:13:46,682
Now he's bragging
about shoplifting.

351
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:47,856
Why don't you
just wait outside?

352
00:13:47,856 --> 00:13:49,133
- I think that's for the best.
- Yeah.

353
00:13:49,133 --> 00:13:50,686
I'm sorry, you guys said
that you were here

354
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:52,964
for the--the DJ gig
or some molly?

355
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:55,105
Okay.
And that's a felony.

356
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:58,625
We were here for the DJ gig,
but seeing as how I'm a cop

357
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,455
and you just committed
several crimes in front of me,

358
00:14:00,455 --> 00:14:01,663
now I'm here to arrest you.

359
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:03,078
All right,
good news, bad news.

360
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:05,046
The Hammer,
aka William Robert Bennett,

361
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:07,565
has an outstanding
felony warrant.

362
00:14:07,565 --> 00:14:09,912
Wait, his name is
Billy Bob Bennett?

363
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:10,982
Correct.

364
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:12,743
No wonder
he prefers his nickname.

365
00:14:12,743 --> 00:14:15,090
Can I finish the whole
good news/bad news cliché?

366
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,265
Yes.
Sorry, knock yourself out.

367
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:19,681
The Hammer has
a felony warrant,

368
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:21,614
which means we can go
kick down his door right now.

369
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:23,823
Which is good,
but he bought the ring legally.

370
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:26,067
Which is bad, because
he's under no obligation

371
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,517
to give it to us, and I'd argue
he's even less inclined

372
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,071
to hand it over
once we arrest him.

373
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:33,798
- Mm-hmm.
- Plus--

374
00:14:33,798 --> 00:14:36,215
Plus what?

375
00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:38,976
Plus, The Hammer
is called The Hammer

376
00:14:38,976 --> 00:14:40,805
because he likes to fight.

377
00:14:40,805 --> 00:14:43,187
And there's no one he loves
to fight more than cops.

378
00:14:43,187 --> 00:14:45,431
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:48,019
Well, after you.

380
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:51,437
No, ladies first.

381
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:06,176
Oh.
Um, just wait. Hear us out.

382
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:09,248
Earlier today, you bought
a wedding ring at a pawn shop.

383
00:15:09,248 --> 00:15:11,457
Yeah.
I'm getting married in a month.

384
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:12,975
Oh, congratulations.

385
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:15,599
Unfortunately,
that ring was stolen,

386
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,980
and we--we will need it back.

387
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,121
Well, I paid 1,000 bucks
for it.

388
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:22,157
Right, which is why
we are willing

389
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:24,780
to make a trade with you today.

390
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,919
You give us the ring

391
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,232
and we will give you
a head start.

392
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:30,338
She's lying.

393
00:15:30,338 --> 00:15:31,925
She's not.

394
00:15:31,925 --> 00:15:34,135
You give it to us, we head
back down to the shop,

395
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:35,964
we'll wait 20 minutes
before we call for backup.

396
00:15:35,964 --> 00:15:37,241
You can make a run for it,

397
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:38,898
grab the missus-to-be,
head to ground.

398
00:15:38,898 --> 00:15:42,212
Oh, right.

399
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:43,868
Hmm.

400
00:15:43,868 --> 00:15:45,939
Nah.
- Mm.

401
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:47,182
Why not?

402
00:15:47,182 --> 00:15:49,529
Because eventually,
I'm gonna get caught.

403
00:15:49,529 --> 00:15:51,531
But you needing something
from me,

404
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:52,843
now, that's an opportunity.

405
00:15:52,843 --> 00:15:54,189
What kind of opportunity?

406
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:56,433
A fair fight for once.

407
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,435
You beat me,
I'll give you the ring

408
00:15:58,435 --> 00:16:00,644
and I put your cuffs on.

409
00:16:00,644 --> 00:16:02,370
I beat you,

410
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,373
I get to keep the ring
and I still put the cuffs on.

411
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:08,099
No fight, no ring.

412
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:13,771
Guess you're gonna have
to fight him.

413
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:15,877
I have to look amazing
in a dress tomorrow.

414
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:17,361
Nobody cares
what you look like.

415
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:19,432
He's huge.
I am not fighting him.

416
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:23,229
Let's go.

417
00:16:23,229 --> 00:16:24,540
Yes!

418
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:28,165
- You got this.
- Thanks.

419
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:18,767
Oh, my God.

420
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,414
All right! You win.

421
00:17:45,414 --> 00:17:46,898
You win.
You win.

422
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,935
The ring's in the drawer
over there.

423
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,330
That's good.

424
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,090
Here.

425
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,236
Good job.

426
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:15,237
Yeah, thanks.

427
00:18:15,237 --> 00:18:16,445
Yeah.

428
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:17,515
Are you okay?

429
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:20,104
Yeah, I'm great.

430
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:21,209
Oh.

431
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:23,816
Got your text.
What's up?

432
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:26,681
A tox screen came back
on that hinky flowerpot.

433
00:18:26,681 --> 00:18:27,820
Pure heroin.

434
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,028
That the skell
that our homeowner

435
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:30,202
bought the flowerpot from?

436
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:31,824
Yep, Seth Gallegos.

437
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:32,998
Couple misdemeanor priors.

438
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:34,344
You want help
taking a run at him?

439
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,829
No, I'm gonna get
the rookie to do it.

440
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:38,969
Yeah, see what she's got.

441
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:40,868
And you invited me
to watch the show.

442
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:42,559
- Mm-hmm.
- Gracias.

443
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:48,116
Mr. Gallegos,
thank you for coming in.

444
00:18:48,116 --> 00:18:49,462
Didn't think I had a choice.

445
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,051
Oh, no, you absolutely do.

446
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:56,642
I just was hoping you can
clear up a few things.

447
00:18:56,642 --> 00:18:58,299
Let's start easy.

448
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,233
Do you sell these at
the Silverlake Farmers Market?

449
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:02,717
I don't know.

450
00:19:02,717 --> 00:19:03,718
No, I don't.

451
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:06,238
Seth.

452
00:19:06,238 --> 00:19:08,378
I think you know
you're in trouble here.

453
00:19:08,378 --> 00:19:09,724
We tested the flowerpots.

454
00:19:09,724 --> 00:19:12,278
It's made of compressed heroin.

455
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:13,279
I don't know what that is.

456
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,143
You don't know
what heroin is?

457
00:19:15,143 --> 00:19:16,559
All right,
let's just cut to the chase.

458
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,422
You're a low-level drug mule,

459
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:20,045
most likely working
for the crew

460
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:22,047
that converts the flowerpots
into street product.

461
00:19:22,047 --> 00:19:24,739
You figured nobody would miss
the real flowerpots

462
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:26,223
that are packed
in the front of the truck

463
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:28,329
to hide the fake ones,
so you started selling them.

464
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:32,678
But you sold
the wrong planters.

465
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:34,266
How am I doing?

466
00:19:34,266 --> 00:19:37,580
You do know that El Jefe
is going to be homicidal

467
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,582
when he finds out
you stole from him.

468
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:40,997
I didn't steal.

469
00:19:40,997 --> 00:19:42,999
I don't steal.
I'm not a thief.

470
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:44,379
And I don't know
what you're talking about.

471
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:45,795
A drug mule? What?

472
00:19:45,795 --> 00:19:49,212
Listen, you have more power
than you realize.

473
00:19:49,212 --> 00:19:51,248
Start talking
and you can name your terms,

474
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:52,664
get immunity, protection.

475
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:54,527
Otherwise, I'm afraid
the next time I see you,

476
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,427
you'll be in a body bag.

477
00:19:57,427 --> 00:19:59,878
- She has him.
- You putting money on that?

478
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:01,845
Hell no. I didn't say
she could land him.

479
00:20:01,845 --> 00:20:06,091
You said I was free to go,
so I'm gonna go.

480
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:07,437
Okay, wait.

481
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:10,026
This offer's got a clock on it,
like your life.

482
00:20:10,026 --> 00:20:12,615
Here's my card.
Call me anytime.

483
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:18,648
So much room for improvement,
Miss Cleo.

484
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:19,380
Yeah, I know.

485
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,623
I didn't have anything
to hold him on.

486
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:22,625
To be fair, you got him
to the finish line.

487
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,729
Yeah, but I didn't
get him across.

488
00:20:23,729 --> 00:20:25,041
So what now?

489
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,146
Write it up and hand it off
to Narcotics.

490
00:20:27,146 --> 00:20:29,390
This one goes
in your loss column.

491
00:20:31,737 --> 00:20:32,911
<i>Where have you been?</i>

492
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:34,602
Buying a new phone.
Why? What's wrong?

493
00:20:34,602 --> 00:20:37,053
The florist tried
calling you, like, ten times.

494
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:38,399
He thought we'd ghosted him.

495
00:20:38,399 --> 00:20:40,573
He had another order
and he sold our flowers.

496
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,265
What?
Why wouldn't he call you?

497
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:44,405
I might have been
on another call.

498
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,269
Okay, let's just focus
on solutions.

499
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:47,926
Well, there are none.
It's end of day.

500
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:49,859
There is no florist
that could handle an order

501
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:51,861
this large last-minute.

502
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:53,621
But we need to have flowers
for the wedding.

503
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:56,003
We will, and I know
exactly where to get them.

504
00:20:56,003 --> 00:20:57,142
Don't worry about this.

505
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:59,316
You just go
and enjoy girls' night.

506
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:01,594
<i>I got this.</i>
- Okay. Thank you.

507
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,566
Where's my ring?

508
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,224
Oh.
Hey, what's up?

509
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:12,640
My wedding ring is missing.

510
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,124
No, it's not.

511
00:21:14,124 --> 00:21:17,645
Randy got caramel on it,
so I got it cleaned for you.

512
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:19,095
Here it is. Here it is.
- Thank you.

513
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:20,337
Knock, knock.

514
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:21,684
I have a cake
for the Nolan-Nune wedding.

515
00:21:21,684 --> 00:21:24,376
I'm sorry,
but there's been a mistake,

516
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:26,758
which is clearly
our official wedding motto.

517
00:21:26,758 --> 00:21:28,242
This cake is supposed
to be delivered

518
00:21:28,242 --> 00:21:29,381
to our wedding tomorrow.

519
00:21:29,381 --> 00:21:30,865
We're closed tomorrow.
It's now or never.

520
00:21:30,865 --> 00:21:33,212
No one ever mentioned that
to me when I placed the order.

521
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:35,801
How am I supposed
to move this c--

522
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:37,665
uh, wait, that's wrong.

523
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:39,667
Is that coconut cream?
- Yeah, vegan.

524
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:42,601
Uh, no. Deadly.
My husband is allergic to that.

525
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,085
You're gonna have to redo it.
- Closed tomorrow.

526
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:45,328
Your husband doesn't have
to eat it.

527
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:46,847
It's our wedding cake.

528
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,883
Hey. Hey.

529
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:52,507
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

530
00:21:52,507 --> 00:21:54,509
Can you help me make
a new wedding cake?

531
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:56,097
No. God no.

532
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:58,859
I burn kitchens down.

533
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,585
But we can call in
for reinforcements.

534
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:02,759
Hey, Randy.

535
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:05,210
I know I said I didn't want
a bachelor party,

536
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,006
but I need you to help me
get some guys together.

537
00:22:08,006 --> 00:22:10,491
Oh, these are perfect!

538
00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:13,597
This is
a delightful bachelor party.

539
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:15,047
Not a bachelor party.

540
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:16,186
Oh, hello.

541
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:17,740
Please do not be using
the masking tape.

542
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,672
We have
this entzueckend floral tape.

543
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,503
Yeah, Randy watched
about 57 ClipTalk videos,

544
00:22:22,503 --> 00:22:23,780
so he's the expert now.

545
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,713
Wesley was catching me up
on your lawsuit.

546
00:22:25,713 --> 00:22:27,370
Yeah, I'm trying not
to think about it.

547
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,854
The suit's frivolous.
Judge will see that.

548
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:30,545
I'm not worried
about the lawsuit.

549
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:31,788
I'm worried about Monica.

550
00:22:31,788 --> 00:22:34,135
Oscar can't afford
15 minutes of her time,

551
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:35,930
much less full representation.

552
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,518
Elijah has
to be bankrolling this.

553
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:39,352
Maybe, but Monica has plenty

554
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:40,735
other clients
that hate the LAPD.

555
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,282
Whatever happens,
maybe we just don't

556
00:22:42,307 --> 00:22:43,305
talk about it at the wedding.

557
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,664
I'll tell Bailey later.

558
00:22:44,689 --> 00:22:45,719
The timing couldn't be worse.

559
00:22:45,744 --> 00:22:47,472
Leave it to Oscar to sue Nolan

560
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:49,119
the day before his wedding.

561
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:51,422
Wait, Oscar is suing John?

562
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:53,300
Please tell me
your bachelorette party

563
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:56,086
will involve less baking
and more actual party.

564
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:58,008
That is a long way off,

565
00:22:58,033 --> 00:22:59,200
if it's even in our future.

566
00:22:59,225 --> 00:23:00,536
You and Tim are
so great together.

567
00:23:00,561 --> 00:23:02,046
We're great
when she's not accusing me

568
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:03,244
of made-up transgressions.

569
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:05,133
Look,
I'm not imagining things.

570
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:07,071
Tim is traumatized
by what happened with Isabel.

571
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:07,953
He just won't admit it.

572
00:23:07,978 --> 00:23:09,547
Honestly,
I think she's projecting

573
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:11,633
or just using this
as an excuse.

574
00:23:11,658 --> 00:23:13,164
Yeah, well,
undercover work is

575
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:15,258
kind of scary and dangerous.

576
00:23:15,283 --> 00:23:17,102
Maybe he's not the only one

577
00:23:17,127 --> 00:23:18,563
that's scared
of what might happen.

578
00:23:18,588 --> 00:23:20,610
No. I'm fine.

579
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:21,739
He has the problem.

580
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:25,008
How do I prove
that I'm not the problem?

581
00:23:25,033 --> 00:23:26,129
I have an idea.

582
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,569
It's only ein wenig crazy.

583
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:31,227
Hey.

584
00:23:31,227 --> 00:23:33,643
Hey, I gotta get out of here.
This is sad.

585
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:34,920
<i>We can get dinner
at that Korean place you like.</i>

586
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,198
I can't. Look, I failed
with a drug mule today.

587
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:39,718
I really need to show Harper
what I'm capable of.

588
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:41,754
- What, by baking a cake?
- Whatever it takes.

589
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,170
See you tomorrow.

590
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:46,173
That was Aaron.
- Yeah, I figured.

591
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:47,899
You guys are close nowadays.

592
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:48,934
Yeah.

593
00:23:48,934 --> 00:23:50,522
Is that a problem?

594
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:52,006
It could be.

595
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:54,008
Look, you guys went
through a trauma together,

596
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:55,872
and it bonded you,
and that connection makes

597
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:58,357
every other relationship pale
in comparison.

598
00:23:58,357 --> 00:24:01,222
But you cannot be
his entire support system.

599
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:03,707
Okay? That is a slow poison.

600
00:24:03,707 --> 00:24:07,056
Okay.
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

601
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:08,781
Tim wants me to meet him
at the station.

602
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,853
Maybe he's ready to make up.

603
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:12,406
Or he has something to say
that's gonna make you

604
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:14,926
want to kill him,
and he wants witnesses.

605
00:24:14,926 --> 00:24:16,375
Man,
if he wants to keep arguing,

606
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:17,929
I don't see the point.

607
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:20,362
Okay, the cake
is almost done.

608
00:24:20,362 --> 00:24:21,846
We just need to do
the fondant flowers.

609
00:24:21,846 --> 00:24:25,539
There's four different types,
and we need 20 of each.

610
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,058
Run.

611
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:33,720
Oh, hey.
Do you know where Tim is?

612
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,377
Yeah.
I think he's in interrogation.

613
00:24:37,137 --> 00:24:38,276
What?

614
00:24:41,003 --> 00:24:42,418
What is happening right now?

615
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:45,525
I am gonna prove to you
that I'm rooting for you.

616
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,216
With a lie detector test?

617
00:24:47,216 --> 00:24:51,634
- Yes.
- Wait, so I can ask anything?

618
00:24:51,634 --> 00:24:53,429
Well, I mean, the point is
for you to ask me

619
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:55,466
about you making detective,
you know,

620
00:24:55,466 --> 00:24:57,019
working undercover,
that sort of thing.

621
00:24:57,019 --> 00:24:58,434
Mm-hmm. Sure.

622
00:24:58,434 --> 00:25:03,646
But, I mean, you did go through
all this trouble, right?

623
00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:06,166
We should be thorough,
don't you think?

624
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,512
What do you want to ask?

625
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,073
Mm.

626
00:25:11,136 --> 00:25:13,311
When I have you trap bugs
in my apartment,

627
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,141
do you release them outside
like I ask?

628
00:25:18,972 --> 00:25:20,870
No.

629
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,597
True? I knew it.
You just kill them?

630
00:25:23,597 --> 00:25:26,082
Yes.
Because they're bugs.

631
00:25:28,775 --> 00:25:30,604
Okay.

632
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:36,230
Do you love me?

633
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:42,892
Yes.

634
00:25:42,892 --> 00:25:45,688
I love you.

635
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:47,483
True.

636
00:25:47,483 --> 00:25:48,484
Hmm.

637
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:53,385
Okay.

638
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:54,490
You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

639
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,147
- Big one.
- Ready.

640
00:25:56,564 --> 00:26:00,531
Do you want me to be
an undercover detective?

641
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:01,773
Yes.

642
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,778
You liar.

643
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:08,331
Huh.

644
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:10,023
I guess we really do
have a problem.

645
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,611
Today is the day.

646
00:26:14,611 --> 00:26:16,751
It is.

647
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:18,581
It's gonna be great.

648
00:26:18,581 --> 00:26:20,444
As long as we're married
at the end of it,

649
00:26:20,444 --> 00:26:22,585
I'll be happy.

650
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:25,864
Why do you taste like frosting?

651
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:27,762
Mm, new face serum.

652
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:29,868
Oh, that's nice.

653
00:26:29,868 --> 00:26:31,007
This is nice.

654
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,250
Let's just snuggle in peace

655
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,735
for a little while longer.

656
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:36,253
Mm-hmm.

657
00:26:38,186 --> 00:26:39,394
Okay.

658
00:26:39,394 --> 00:26:42,950
And the moment is over.

659
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,435
Next time we get married,
no houseguests.

660
00:26:45,435 --> 00:26:47,644
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, where's Henry?

661
00:26:47,644 --> 00:26:48,956
He was supposed
to get in last night.

662
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:51,337
Landing at Andrews, I think.

663
00:26:51,337 --> 00:26:53,339
Why would he be landing
at an air force base?

664
00:26:53,339 --> 00:26:54,996
Mm, did I forget to mention

665
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:57,654
that he had
some travel complications?

666
00:26:57,654 --> 00:26:59,311
Yes, you did.

667
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:00,795
Same way
you forgot to mention

668
00:27:00,795 --> 00:27:03,453
that Oscar is suing you
and that's why you had

669
00:27:03,453 --> 00:27:04,696
to give up your phone
yesterday.

670
00:27:04,696 --> 00:27:07,353
Touché.
I didn't want to worry you.

671
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:09,597
Exactly.

672
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:11,634
Henry should make it in time
for the ceremony, though.

673
00:27:11,634 --> 00:27:14,602
Well,
that's all that matters.

674
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:18,295
Let's go get married.
- Let's do it.

675
00:27:18,295 --> 00:27:19,469
You look amazing.

676
00:27:19,469 --> 00:27:20,815
I mean, the one-shoulder
was great too,

677
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:22,334
but this is my favorite.

678
00:27:22,334 --> 00:27:23,784
Thank you. I was torn.

679
00:27:23,784 --> 00:27:25,199
The other one had
a beautiful color,

680
00:27:25,199 --> 00:27:26,545
but it did not go
with the shoes.

681
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:27,788
Oh, and if you swap out
the shoes,

682
00:27:27,788 --> 00:27:29,237
then the handbag doesn't work.

683
00:27:29,237 --> 00:27:31,757
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

684
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:33,000
So I went with a suit.

685
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,484
Hey, me too.

686
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:35,485
Mine has a tie.

687
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:36,520
Oh, my God, same.

688
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,984
So how long did you stay?

689
00:27:51,984 --> 00:27:53,986
I bailed
right after we talked.

690
00:27:53,986 --> 00:27:55,747
You know, it doesn't seem
like you're hanging out

691
00:27:55,747 --> 00:27:56,782
with the other guys much.

692
00:27:56,782 --> 00:27:58,059
I guess not.

693
00:27:58,059 --> 00:27:59,820
I'd rather hang out with you.

694
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,029
Yeah, but it can't hurt,
though,

695
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:04,065
having more people to talk to,
plus your shrink.

696
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:05,239
What, you trying
to get rid of me?

697
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,999
Never. Never.

698
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:09,001
Just--just looking out for you.

699
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,278
Thanks.

700
00:28:10,278 --> 00:28:11,866
You're the best.
- Mm.

701
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,804
By the way, I read
your book club selection.

702
00:28:18,804 --> 00:28:22,049
When Elsie died in childbirth,
I must admit, I cried.

703
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:24,051
Me too.
That was awful.

704
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:26,018
And when it turned out
that the doctor's mother

705
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:27,192
was alive the whole time--

706
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:29,919
Well, that I saw coming.

707
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,679
None of that happened
in the book, did it?

708
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,577
No. What's going on?

709
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:35,441
After everything
that happened with Aaron,

710
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:37,858
I saw how much good I could do
working in the hospital.

711
00:28:37,858 --> 00:28:41,724
So I decided to finish
my social work degree.

712
00:28:41,724 --> 00:28:42,932
That's where I've been going
at night.

713
00:28:42,932 --> 00:28:44,416
Why the subterfuge?

714
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:45,555
I was worried
I'd get three classes in

715
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:46,867
and realize I couldn't hack it.

716
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:49,386
Going back after all
these years, it was scary.

717
00:28:49,386 --> 00:28:52,286
I did not want to have to worry
about disappointing you.

718
00:28:52,286 --> 00:28:54,288
As if you could.

719
00:28:54,288 --> 00:28:56,290
Okay, so how are you doing?

720
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,912
Top of my class.

721
00:28:57,912 --> 00:28:59,362
Graduate next week.

722
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:02,399
Hospital job starts
the week after.

723
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,780
I was gonna tell you
this weekend.

724
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,471
- You go, girl.
- I was gonna--

725
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:07,059
That's good.

726
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:08,302
Oh, pardon me one second.

727
00:29:08,302 --> 00:29:09,579
Small problem.

728
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:10,960
Father O'Malley's
stuck in traffic.

729
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,824
Oh, okay.
Should we wait?

730
00:29:12,824 --> 00:29:13,825
He's in Chatsworth.

731
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,896
So no. Okay.

732
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:17,276
Sorry, everyone,
if I could just get

733
00:29:17,276 --> 00:29:18,484
your attention for one minute.

734
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:21,867
I realize this is
literally last-minute.

735
00:29:21,997 --> 00:29:24,836
Is anyone here qualified
to officiate a wedding?

736
00:29:24,836 --> 00:29:25,818
I can.

737
00:29:25,843 --> 00:29:28,046
As a minister
of the Universal Life Church,

738
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,957
I would be honored
to marry you two crazy kids.

739
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:32,602
- Sit down, German.
- Okay.

740
00:29:32,602 --> 00:29:35,501
- I got this.
- Thank you.

741
00:29:48,794 --> 00:29:50,723
Here, I'll take that.

742
00:29:50,826 --> 00:29:52,795
Please be seated.

743
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:59,271
You are all here today
because you love these two.

744
00:29:59,537 --> 00:30:01,926
They're here to make
a commitment under God

745
00:30:01,951 --> 00:30:04,565
in front of family and friends

746
00:30:04,565 --> 00:30:07,257
to love, honor,
and cherish each other

747
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:09,397
for the rest of their lives.

748
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:11,641
Bailey.

749
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,991
I'm suddenly so nervous.

750
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:18,579
There is nothing,

751
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:21,064
literally nothing else
in my life

752
00:30:21,177 --> 00:30:23,446
I am as certain of
as marrying you.

753
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:25,897
I must have written
a hundred different vows

754
00:30:25,897 --> 00:30:28,037
and I threw them all away

755
00:30:28,037 --> 00:30:30,280
'cause there were
too many words.

756
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:34,767
And the way you make me feel
is so simple to express.

757
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:40,083
I feel loved and seen

758
00:30:40,193 --> 00:30:44,916
and desired and happy.

759
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:49,955
For that, I will love you
forever and a day.

760
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:54,132
That's your ring.

761
00:30:57,867 --> 00:30:58,972
- My turn.
- Yes.

762
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,245
Bailey Nune,

763
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:08,836
you came into my life
in a towel on my doorstep

764
00:31:08,836 --> 00:31:11,632
with an unlikely story
about being locked out

765
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:13,097
by a meddlesome dog.

766
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,187
And I remember thinking,

767
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:17,534
"I'm either being conned
by a hot model,

768
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:22,022
or I have just met
the woman of my dreams."

769
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,334
You're damn right
I love and cherish you.

770
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:27,855
You are the most impressive
person I've ever met.

771
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:32,756
And I wake up every morning
to the dream of being your man.

772
00:31:35,013 --> 00:31:38,486
And I promise
that making you happy

773
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:42,663
will be my everyday everything.

774
00:31:42,966 --> 00:31:45,321
Well, there's nothing
I can say to top that,

775
00:31:45,451 --> 00:31:50,705
so I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

776
00:31:50,923 --> 00:31:52,580
Kiss your bride.

777
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:04,478
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mrs. and Mr. John Nolan.

778
00:32:12,969 --> 00:32:14,936
- Hey, Randy.
- Oh, James.

779
00:32:14,991 --> 00:32:16,318
What a lucky man to be married

780
00:32:16,343 --> 00:32:18,655
to the beautiful and terrifying
Detective Harper.

781
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,372
I couldn't agree more.

782
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:25,675
Hey, I was wondering
if I could share a playlist.

783
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,977
What, to--

784
00:32:32,376 --> 00:32:34,693
So, what, you just had
this playlist ready to go?

785
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:36,237
Oh, I set it up
the minute that you mentioned

786
00:32:36,262 --> 00:32:37,539
Randy was the DJ.

787
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:39,083
- Oh, that's why I love you.
- I got your back.

788
00:33:12,548 --> 00:33:15,240
Tim and Lucy are
gonna be okay?

789
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:17,267
I'm sure they'll work it out.

790
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:18,915
You want to get some air?
- Yeah, sure.

791
00:33:21,942 --> 00:33:24,289
Okay.

792
00:33:25,891 --> 00:33:29,585
You know Mercury is merging
into Pisces right now,

793
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,612
which tends
to amplify psychic activity,

794
00:33:31,637 --> 00:33:34,808
especially for people born
with Mercury in Pisces.

795
00:33:34,833 --> 00:33:35,870
And that means?

796
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,112
Just pay attention
to your dreams

797
00:33:37,112 --> 00:33:38,424
for the next couple of weeks.

798
00:33:38,424 --> 00:33:40,150
The cosmos might be trying
to tell you something.

799
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:45,466
Yeah, well, my dreams
are mainly, um... violent.

800
00:33:45,888 --> 00:33:48,123
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

801
00:33:48,123 --> 00:33:49,884
Yeah, I haven't
told anyone that.

802
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:51,092
Not even the shrink.

803
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:53,094
Okay, isn't that exactly
the kind of stuff

804
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:54,519
you're supposed
to be telling her?

805
00:33:54,544 --> 00:33:56,373
If I'm trying
to get better, yes.

806
00:33:56,373 --> 00:34:00,826
If I'm trying to get back
on patrol, no.

807
00:34:00,826 --> 00:34:01,999
I mean, you're the only person

808
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,794
that I can talk to
about all this.

809
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:05,278
And I will always
be here for you.

810
00:34:07,729 --> 00:34:09,421
Aaron.

811
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:11,077
- Oh.
- I--

812
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,045
No, I thought--

813
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:14,149
I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

814
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:15,634
I'm so--I am so sorry.
- It's fine.

815
00:34:15,634 --> 00:34:18,671
I just--I just don't--

816
00:34:18,671 --> 00:34:20,190
yeah, well, I'm gonna go
grab a drink.

817
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,571
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

818
00:34:24,151 --> 00:34:26,878
Oh, no.

819
00:34:37,107 --> 00:34:37,863
Hello?

820
00:34:37,863 --> 00:34:39,796
<i>Hey, it's Seth.</i>

821
00:34:39,796 --> 00:34:42,454
<i>Flower pot heroin guy.
Allegedly.</i>

822
00:34:42,454 --> 00:34:45,629
<i>You were right--I need help.
They're hunting for me.</i>

823
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:48,149
Send me your address.
I'll come pick you up.

824
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,464
Tequila shots.
Keep 'em coming.

825
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,533
Clearly, I'm more conflicted
about you working undercover

826
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:30,018
than I realized.

827
00:35:30,018 --> 00:35:31,917
It's understandable.

828
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:33,608
Losing Isabel
in such a horrible way,

829
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:35,714
I mean, how could you
possibly be over that?

830
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:37,267
Yeah, but it's unfair to you.

831
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:38,786
I need to deal with it.

832
00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:40,615
You know, your dream
should have nothing

833
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:44,377
to do with my issues.

834
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:46,310
Thank you.

835
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,797
We're gonna get through this.

836
00:35:49,797 --> 00:35:51,523
I love you.

837
00:35:58,564 --> 00:36:00,877
Well, you say that,
but till I put you

838
00:36:00,877 --> 00:36:02,637
under a lie detector,
how can I be sure?

839
00:36:02,637 --> 00:36:04,259
No, not a chance.

840
00:36:04,259 --> 00:36:05,537
I'm not doing it.

841
00:36:05,537 --> 00:36:08,298
You guys made up.
Awesome.

842
00:36:08,298 --> 00:36:09,782
- Yeah.
- Everyone was so worried.

843
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:12,405
They were like--
I told them, "It's fine.

844
00:36:12,405 --> 00:36:13,510
They're solid," so...

845
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,236
Whoa, how much
have you had to drink?

846
00:36:15,236 --> 00:36:16,686
I don't know.
Who cares?

847
00:36:16,686 --> 00:36:18,239
Well, you should,
because as cops,

848
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,758
we're always
one person's bad choice away

849
00:36:19,758 --> 00:36:20,931
from being on duty.

850
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:22,692
Hey, where--where's Celina?

851
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:24,521
I don't know.
Why would I know?

852
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:26,799
It's not like
we're together, so...

853
00:36:26,799 --> 00:36:28,560
yeah, all right.

854
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,941
See ya.

855
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,955
Come on!

856
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:46,232
No, no! All right, all right.

857
00:36:46,232 --> 00:36:47,993
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

858
00:36:51,203 --> 00:36:52,963
- Celina?
- Hey, I'm in trouble.

859
00:36:52,963 --> 00:36:54,378
Gallegos called me.

860
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,208
He called me--

861
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,601
Celina's in trouble.
She went to meet a CI.

862
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:00,627
- Where?
- I don't know.

863
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:01,628
Call was cut off.
I'm waiting

864
00:37:01,628 --> 00:37:02,733
on a warrant for her phone.

865
00:37:02,733 --> 00:37:03,699
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

866
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:04,700
Something with Celina.

867
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,701
This is Grey.

868
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:07,289
I have an officer in distress.

869
00:37:07,289 --> 00:37:08,670
I need a dedicated airship

870
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:10,775
and citywide alert
pending location.

871
00:37:10,775 --> 00:37:12,363
I'll get Metro on standby.

872
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:13,640
- We gotta get changed.
- Give me your keys.

873
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,159
I'll grab your go bags
out of your cars.

874
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:16,781
- Thank you.
- I'll go with you. Come on.

875
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:18,127
All right,
Celina is downtown.

876
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:19,853
They're waiting
on a more precise location.

877
00:37:19,853 --> 00:37:21,130
We'll get it on our way.

878
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,822
- I am sorry, I have to go.
- I know. I know.

879
00:37:22,822 --> 00:37:24,548
Just please don't die
on our wedding night.

880
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:26,135
Hey, I heard
something happened to Celina.

881
00:37:26,135 --> 00:37:27,205
Is she okay?
- We don't know.

882
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:28,206
We're going downtown
to find her.

883
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:29,587
Okay, I'm coming with you.

884
00:37:29,587 --> 00:37:30,657
No, you're drunk and not
cleared for active duty.

885
00:37:30,657 --> 00:37:31,865
Sit your ass down
and do some praying.

886
00:37:31,865 --> 00:37:32,935
We got him.

887
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:34,178
Hey, handsome.

888
00:37:34,178 --> 00:37:36,076
Hey, let's get some coffee
in you, yeah?

889
00:37:36,076 --> 00:37:38,251
Yeah.

890
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,553
She's not here.

891
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:06,762
Start a grid search.

892
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:09,247
Whittier to 1st to the 10.

893
00:38:09,247 --> 00:38:10,283
They took her by car.

894
00:38:10,283 --> 00:38:12,181
She could be anywhere
right now.

895
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:17,048
Guys, I got some blood
over here.

896
00:38:17,048 --> 00:38:19,154
Looks like somebody got
dragged that way.

897
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:40,762
Two male suspects.
One gun visible.

898
00:38:40,762 --> 00:38:42,349
We gotta get past 'em
to get inside.

899
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:43,696
Get it done.

900
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,353
Harper, Lopez,
we'll breach from the back.

901
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:50,392
All right, how do you want
to play this?

902
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:51,600
Take off your tie.

903
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:21,526
Right here.
Down on your knees.

904
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:22,838
Here.
I'll stay with them.

905
00:39:22,838 --> 00:39:24,426
You guys go.

906
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:21,138
Last chance--
tell me where my stuff is,

907
00:40:21,138 --> 00:40:25,004
or I will cut your throat
and move on to your girlfriend.

908
00:40:30,009 --> 00:40:32,321
All right, it's
a tactical nightmare in there.

909
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:33,667
There's no way to get
in there quickly enough

910
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:35,704
to neutralize them
and save Celina.

911
00:40:40,674 --> 00:40:43,091
What the--

912
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,265
Sarge.

913
00:40:45,538 --> 00:40:46,539
Give me his jacket.

914
00:40:54,965 --> 00:40:57,243
- Time's up.
- Hey, hey. Come on.

915
00:40:57,243 --> 00:40:59,797
Aah!

916
00:41:00,798 --> 00:41:01,903
Hey! Hey!

917
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:03,076
Put your hands in the air!

918
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:04,457
- Police, hands up!
- Police!

919
00:41:05,561 --> 00:41:07,218
Police!
Show me your hands!

920
00:41:07,218 --> 00:41:09,703
Show me your hands!

921
00:41:09,703 --> 00:41:11,567
Not to judge,

922
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:12,914
I think you would have had
more fun at the wedding.

923
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:15,241
No kidding.

924
00:41:25,311 --> 00:41:26,760
Bailey?

925
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,065
How's it going?

926
00:41:37,189 --> 00:41:39,294
I can't move my body.

927
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:41,045
Did I finish packing
for our honeymoon?

928
00:41:41,045 --> 00:41:42,391
Yeah, almost.

929
00:41:42,391 --> 00:41:44,083
I say we buy clothes there.

930
00:41:44,083 --> 00:41:46,257
That is genius.
I mean, what do we need anyway?

931
00:41:46,257 --> 00:41:49,088
Just bathing suits.
- Yeah.

932
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:51,262
Oh, wow.

933
00:41:51,262 --> 00:41:53,126
I'm so sorry I bailed
on the wedding.

934
00:41:53,126 --> 00:41:54,887
Mm, you didn't miss much.

935
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,958
The cake was
kind of a disaster.

936
00:41:59,857 --> 00:42:02,308
How much longer before
we have to be at the airport?

937
00:42:05,311 --> 00:42:07,347
Four hours.

938
00:42:07,347 --> 00:42:10,695
Oh, there's plenty of time
for a little nap.

939
00:42:10,841 --> 00:42:13,741
Siri, wake me in an hour.

940
00:42:13,766 --> 00:42:15,561
Yeah.

941
00:42:16,046 --> 00:42:18,807
<i>I didn't get that.
Could you try again?</i>
