1
00:00:03,693 --> 00:00:07,076
These night shifts
have got me tired.

2
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:08,836
Well, we've got
four more hours.

3
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:10,217
Keep it together.
- Yes, sir.

4
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:13,392
Sorry, it's just,
a week of nights and I--

5
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:15,429
I still can't get
my circadian rhythm in line.

6
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,224
And forget about
altering my chronotype

7
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:19,743
to maximize sleep efficiency.

8
00:00:19,743 --> 00:00:21,021
Well, perhaps
it's for the best,

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,470
seeing as how
we're getting back on days

10
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,024
now that I finally
paid back everyone

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,197
who covered for me
while I was gone.

12
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:26,854
Hm.

13
00:00:26,854 --> 00:00:28,062
Forgetting anything?

14
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:31,583
- I don't think so.
- You sure?

15
00:00:33,964 --> 00:00:35,311
- 100% sure.
- Good.

16
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:36,829
How about the suspect?

17
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,350
<i>♪ Whoa, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,594
<i>♪ I'm gonna win for you</i>

19
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:46,011
<i>♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪</i>

20
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:50,360
Hey.

21
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,223
Hi.

22
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:54,985
Is that a present for me?

23
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:56,573
Yep. And the beer's for me.

24
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:58,023
Thank you.

25
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:03,132
What?

26
00:01:03,132 --> 00:01:06,583
Nothing.
I'm--it's just, um,

27
00:01:06,583 --> 00:01:09,379
gift giving isn't really
your love language, so...

28
00:01:09,379 --> 00:01:11,174
Oh, yeah.

29
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:12,486
What is my love language?

30
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:14,660
Terse nods, mainly.

31
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,869
Okay, well, I'm trying
to change things up.

32
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,354
Okay.
Well, can I open it now?

33
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:19,769
Yeah, of course.

34
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:25,326
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:25,326 --> 00:01:27,501
My killed-in-action radio?

36
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:28,571
Aww.

37
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:30,297
That is so sweet.

38
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:31,574
Well, it gave its life
for yours,

39
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:34,024
so I thought it'd be nice
to memorialize your effort

40
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:35,992
in the Jeff Budny takedown.

41
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:37,097
Thank you.

42
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,929
Oops.
I-I forgot it was date night.

43
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:42,895
I will hide in my room.

44
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:44,897
You don't have to do that.

45
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,209
No, it's my bad.

46
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,073
What smells so good?
- Paella.

47
00:01:48,073 --> 00:01:49,419
You want me to make you a plate

48
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:51,421
for your room?

49
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:52,698
I would say no,
but I'd be lying.

50
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,701
Yep, Bradford.

51
00:01:55,701 --> 00:01:56,806
Who's this?

52
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:00,913
Understood.
I'll be there in 20.

53
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,087
What's going on?

54
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:03,157
I gotta go, sorry.

55
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:04,158
- Just wait--
- I can't.

56
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:05,332
I'll call you when I can.

57
00:02:11,338 --> 00:02:12,304
What just happened?

58
00:02:12,304 --> 00:02:14,030
I don't know.

59
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,170
Can I do
a vodka soda, please?

60
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:22,038
Dr. London?

61
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:23,591
Hi.

62
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,075
Uh--
- It's okay.

63
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:27,319
I know, uh, seeing a patient
in the wild is tricky.

64
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,218
Sorry, I just had
a whole semester

65
00:02:29,218 --> 00:02:31,220
of ethics classes
flash through my mind.

66
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,498
But if you're okay talking
out in the wild...

67
00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:35,189
Totally. May I?

68
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:37,329
Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:39,020
So do you live around here?

70
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,884
No, I actually live
on the West Side.

71
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:42,541
I just got done seeing a movie
around the corner,

72
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,578
and, uh, came in here
for a little nightcap.

73
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:45,889
Drinking alone?

74
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:46,890
Yeah, but, you know,
I kind of look at it

75
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,375
as a sign of self-assurance,

76
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,170
not so much a cry for help.

77
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,826
What about you?

78
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:56,383
I...I got stood up.

79
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:58,212
Who the hell
would stand you up?

80
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,731
I mean, you are a catch
and then some.

81
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:02,389
Sorry, that's inappropriate.

82
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,493
Completely.

83
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:05,702
But my ego
really appreciated it.

84
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:11,984
Okay. I should go.

85
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,987
Yeah.
Or I could buy you a drink.

86
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:18,474
In a total, like,
patient-doctor kind of way.

87
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:19,854
I really shouldn't.

88
00:03:19,854 --> 00:03:21,131
Right.

89
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:23,513
One drink.

90
00:03:23,513 --> 00:03:24,514
All right, deal.

91
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:25,722
What you drinking?

92
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,360
What's up, man?
Thanks for coming.

93
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,533
I had no choice.

94
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:44,845
If Ray's alive,
we got a problem.

95
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:46,053
He is.
I'm sure.

96
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:47,192
How?

97
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:49,194
They found the tags, his DNA.

98
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:50,575
We saw the air strike.
There's no one who could have

99
00:03:50,575 --> 00:03:51,886
walked away
from something like that.

100
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:53,302
Yeah, that's
what I thought too.

101
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:54,820
But then a few years ago,
I started hearing stories,

102
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,270
that he was still alive,

103
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,823
working as a gun for hire
around the globe.

104
00:03:57,823 --> 00:04:00,585
So I set up some trip wires
just to be sure.

105
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:04,105
That's Ray coming
through LAX yesterday.

106
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:05,521
What the hell's
he doing here?

107
00:04:05,521 --> 00:04:07,177
His mom's dying of cancer.

108
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:08,696
So she's who
we're staking out?

109
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:11,665
Two houses up on the left.
No sign of Ray yet.

110
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:13,632
So when did Ray give a crap
about anybody but himself?

111
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:14,806
Doesn't matter.

112
00:04:14,806 --> 00:04:17,222
We made a promise.

113
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:18,637
That was a long time ago.

114
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:20,915
Time doesn't erase
what he did.

115
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:23,021
Time doesn't bring back
our friends that he killed.

116
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:26,680
And we made a vow that
if by some miracle he survived,

117
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,234
we'd kill him.

118
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:30,856
And I am here
to honor that promise.

119
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:37,380
Most of these men could be
my dad, some my grandpa.

120
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,108
But I'm supposed to be
some sort of authority figure.

121
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:44,076
I have cereal for dinner
at least three nights a week.

122
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:46,527
Oh. So do I.

123
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:48,080
Mine has
dehydrated marshmallows.

124
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,496
Okay, see, that is a problem.

125
00:04:56,779 --> 00:04:59,229
I should go.

126
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:01,577
Yeah.
Uh, time to call an Uber.

127
00:05:01,577 --> 00:05:03,924
I mean, I could
give you a ride.

128
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:04,994
Really?

129
00:05:04,994 --> 00:05:07,376
Yeah, it's not a problem.

130
00:05:07,376 --> 00:05:08,377
Okay.

131
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:09,343
Cool.

132
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:12,657
This is me.

133
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:18,697
Thanks for the ride.

134
00:05:18,697 --> 00:05:20,181
Yeah, no problem.

135
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:25,601
Good night.

136
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:38,407
<i>7-Adam-15, multiple callers
report shots fired,</i>

137
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:40,409
<i>715 Sycamore.</i>

138
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,135
<i>No associated vehicles.
I'll attach two more units.</i>

139
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:47,830
You got here quick.

140
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,865
We were finishing up a call

141
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:50,384
around the corner,
heard the shots.

142
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:52,041
All right, this is
as far as you go.

143
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,663
We'll stage here
until you Code 4 it.

144
00:05:53,663 --> 00:05:55,182
Be safe.
- Right.

145
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:58,047
Follow me.

146
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:02,223
All right, be alert.

147
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:03,224
I know you're tired.

148
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:04,329
Well, not anymore.

149
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:05,710
Adrenaline is flowing.

150
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,125
Good. Let's do this.

151
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:29,492
Juarez.

152
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,639
Go.

153
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:49,478
What happened here?

154
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:52,066
Control, 7-Adam-15,
two victims, gunshot wounds.

155
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:53,240
Still clearing house.

156
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,313
I'll take left. Go.

157
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,151
- Officer Nolan!

158
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,498
Hey, ambulance
is right outside.

159
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:10,533
Stay with me.

160
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:16,712
7-Adam-15,
residence is cleared.

161
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:18,196
Code 4 for fire.

162
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:20,992
One gunshot wound victim
is unconscious but breathing.

163
00:07:20,992 --> 00:07:22,096
How is she?
- Her pulse is weak.

164
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:23,097
She could bleed out.

165
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:24,720
- John?
- Back here.

166
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,724
She's the only one left alive.

167
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:38,492
You didn't clear the closet?

168
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,907
Uh, no.

169
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:42,531
Police. Come out now.

170
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:51,160
Oh. Hey.

171
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,334
What are you doing in here?

172
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:55,682
Come here.
Come here, little one.

173
00:07:57,684 --> 00:07:59,064
What are you doing?

174
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:03,344
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Hey, look at this.

175
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:04,725
You don't need
to see that, okay?

176
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:11,007
- How's the mother?
- Still in surgery.

177
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,215
They're checking in
on the little girl.

178
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:13,562
No visible injuries.

179
00:08:13,562 --> 00:08:15,978
Yeah, her first name is Anna,
last name Hughes.

180
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:17,669
Remi's the mom, Ellis the dad,

181
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:20,189
and the older woman in the
dining room was Grandma Debra.

182
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:21,431
You think the girl saw
what happened?

183
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:22,432
Oh, I hope not.

184
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:23,882
She still hasn't said a word.

185
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:25,919
I've been in contact
with CPS.

186
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,024
They are searching for a family
member to come to the hospital

187
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,992
and take custody of Anna
once she's cleared.

188
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:32,235
You know, we still have
a whole lot of paperwork to do.

189
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:34,237
We'll probably stick around,
see how the surgery goes.

190
00:08:34,237 --> 00:08:35,860
Of course. I'll let you know
if anything changes.

191
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,240
Thank you.

192
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,897
Keep me updated
to the minute on this.

193
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:40,623
A family murdered
in the middle of the night

194
00:08:40,623 --> 00:08:42,487
is gonna keep a lot
of people on edge.

195
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:43,592
Yes, sir.

196
00:08:48,735 --> 00:08:53,533
Now, about you not searching
the closet.

197
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,845
There's no excuse, sir.
I-I saw the injured woman,

198
00:08:55,845 --> 00:08:57,157
and I put her as a priority

199
00:08:57,157 --> 00:08:58,641
before I finished
clearing the room.

200
00:08:58,641 --> 00:08:59,918
It won't happen again.

201
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:01,575
See that it doesn't.

202
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,509
If that was the shooter
in there instead of a child,

203
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:06,442
we'd both be dead.

204
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:30,708
<i>It's Bradford.
You know what to do.</i>

205
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,537
Hey, it's me.

206
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:35,160
Um, no idea
where you are right now,

207
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,542
but, uh, I'm here
if you need me.

208
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,407
So just call me when you can.

209
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:04,086
Yeah, there's a back door,
but you gotta go

210
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:05,570
through the neighbor's yard
to get to it.

211
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,192
And there's no way
to see if Ray's inside.

212
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:08,918
And--and if he is?
Then what?

213
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:10,886
We hog-tie him
and dump him in deep water?

214
00:10:10,886 --> 00:10:12,266
Well, I was thinking
landfill,

215
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:13,682
but if you got a boat--
- This isn't funny.

216
00:10:13,682 --> 00:10:15,269
Just talking about this
is criminal conspiracy.

217
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:18,031
I never would have thought
the Reaper would go soft on me.

218
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:20,136
I ain't going soft.

219
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:21,655
That pact was made
a long time ago

220
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,829
in the anger and fog of war.

221
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:25,417
But now...

222
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,971
I'm a cop.

223
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:27,868
You're an army lawyer.

224
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:29,490
We've built lives.

225
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,561
Yeah, well, what about
Henderson and Coyle?

226
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:34,357
They never got to build
their lives 'cause of Ray.

227
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:36,325
They deserve justice.

228
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:38,638
And we owe that to them.

229
00:10:42,124 --> 00:10:43,573
You okay?

230
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:46,024
I wasn't much older
when my dad died.

231
00:10:46,024 --> 00:10:47,750
Do you think she knows?

232
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,027
I-I don't know.

233
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:50,684
Do you think
she'd even understand?

234
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,237
- I don't know.
- Ah.

235
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:53,583
Her mother's out of surgery.

236
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,137
She flatlined on the table,

237
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,483
but they were able
to get her back.

238
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:57,967
She's still very much
in the woods.

239
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,348
Any luck finding a relative?

240
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:01,005
There's no immediate family
in Los Angeles,

241
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:03,593
but CPS is gonna widen
the search in the morning.

242
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:04,871
So what happens to her now?

243
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:07,390
And please don't say
children's shelter.

244
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,013
For the short term, yes.

245
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:11,360
And if there's no relative
found, then foster care.

246
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,913
Those shelters can be grim.

247
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,019
They're chaotic,
underfunded, understaffed.

248
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:16,227
I agree.

249
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:18,816
Not the most ideal place
for a toddler

250
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:20,887
who just lived through
her family getting slaughtered.

251
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:22,716
Give me a second.

252
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,200
I got him.
I'll get him.

253
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,546
Oh, he landed on his butt.

254
00:11:25,546 --> 00:11:27,894
There we go.

255
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:29,723
He's all better.

256
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,000
Got him?
Here you go.

257
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,176
What do you think?

258
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,143
About what?

259
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:37,835
I'll be right back.

260
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:46,222
What about Anna staying
with us tonight?

261
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:47,568
We aren't registered
foster parents.

262
00:11:47,568 --> 00:11:48,846
It's a process.

263
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:51,503
I'm aware,
but we're first responders.

264
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,678
I'm sure CPS would
sign off on it.

265
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:55,231
Anything's better than
those children's shelters.

266
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:57,199
I don't know about that.

267
00:11:57,199 --> 00:12:00,029
It would be for one night,
or until they find a relative

268
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:02,066
or a temporary
foster situation.

269
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:03,101
But...

270
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:05,690
But what?

271
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:09,867
Nothing.

272
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,247
You're right.

273
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:12,559
You won't regret this.

274
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:13,698
Luna.

275
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:18,427
What about Anna coming home
with us tonight?

276
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:20,049
I don't see why not.

277
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:21,395
I'll go start
making some calls,

278
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:22,465
see if we can make it happen.

279
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:26,884
Just like
the good old days, huh?

280
00:12:26,884 --> 00:12:29,334
Staking out a potential target,
hours and hours of nothing.

281
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,680
Just your bad jokes.

282
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,786
Hey, those jokes were
me training to be a dad.

283
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:34,754
I got two now, Scott and Nancy.

284
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,410
Best kids ever.

285
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,860
Yeah, must take after
their mother.

286
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:42,416
We got movement.

287
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,902
Was that Ray or his mom?

288
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:46,489
Let's go find out.

289
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:47,490
Hey, you think
that's a good idea?

290
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:00,780
What do you want?

291
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,678
Mrs. Watkins,
I'm Sergeant Tim Bradford.

292
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:04,197
This is Major Mark Greer.

293
00:13:04,197 --> 00:13:05,370
We'd like to talk to you
about your son.

294
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,993
Well, he's dead.

295
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:08,718
What else do you need to know?

296
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:10,134
Do you mind if we come inside
for a second to talk?

297
00:13:10,134 --> 00:13:11,411
I do mind.

298
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:12,895
We served with Ray, ma'am.

299
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:14,759
We just need a moment
of your time.

300
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:17,900
Ugh.

301
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:25,252
Well, make it quick.

302
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:26,875
I'm not long for this life,

303
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,877
and I don't want to waste
what's left with you two.

304
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,326
I'm so sorry to hear about

305
00:13:30,326 --> 00:13:31,051
what you've been
going through, ma'am.

306
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:32,915
I lost my mom to cancer.

307
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:35,331
Trust me, she's better off.

308
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:40,716
Would you mind
if I use the bathroom?

309
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:41,890
Down the hall.

310
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,098
Thanks.

311
00:14:30,731 --> 00:14:31,905
Bradford,
you don't need that.

312
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,734
That, uh--

313
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:35,391
What's wrong?

314
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,221
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

315
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:39,913
Yo, Greer.

316
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,640
My God, man, you got old.

317
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,954
I just told them
you were dead.

318
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:47,300
Now you made me look
like an idiot.

319
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,646
Calm down.

320
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:50,027
You don't look like an idiot.

321
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:53,030
Mom, why don't you, um,
give us a minute, huh?

322
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:57,655
You're gonna cry when I die.

323
00:14:57,655 --> 00:14:58,898
We'll see.

324
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:06,146
So...

325
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:09,391
what are you two doing
at a dead guy's house, huh?

326
00:15:09,391 --> 00:15:10,702
Bring you to justice.

327
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,394
Oh, yeah?
For what?

328
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:13,982
For starters, being AWOL,

329
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:16,363
faking your own death,
felony grand theft.

330
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:18,538
You stole at least $1/2 million
from the U.S. government.

331
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:20,920
Can you blame me?
I mean, the CIA was giving away

332
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,473
backpacks of cash.

333
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:23,681
No one was gonna miss it.

334
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:24,854
You called in an air strike

335
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:26,718
on your own guys
when we came for you.

336
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,927
There wasn't enough
of Coyle and Henderson

337
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,997
to fit in a shoebox.

338
00:15:28,997 --> 00:15:32,172
That sounds really bad.

339
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:36,521
But I know that's not true.
Do you know how I know that?

340
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:40,387
Because I read
the after action report

341
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:45,151
that was signed
by the two of you.

342
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,876
The only reason
the report reads that way

343
00:15:46,876 --> 00:15:48,154
is so that your wife
and daughter

344
00:15:48,154 --> 00:15:50,466
could get your death benefits.

345
00:15:52,537 --> 00:15:55,333
I never asked for that.

346
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:59,234
You knew she was about a month
away from "Dear John"-ing me.

347
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:01,891
But thanks
to your bleeding hearts,

348
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:03,169
I'm now untouchable.

349
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,722
I mean, you bring me
in right now,

350
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:07,069
you've got to tell Uncle Sam
about your big lie, right?

351
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:08,864
And you'll, what,
be retroactively

352
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:11,315
dishonorably discharged
and most likely

353
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:12,764
get fired
from your current jobs.

354
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,008
So you can arrest me,
it's okay.

355
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,078
Come on.

356
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,254
Here I am.

357
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:21,739
No?
Yeah, that's what I thought.

358
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:25,812
I'm gonna be here
to watch the old lady croak,

359
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,158
and then get back
to what I was doing.

360
00:16:27,158 --> 00:16:30,851
And we are never going
to see each other again.

361
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:33,061
How does that sound?

362
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:34,441
Sweet.

363
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:55,566
Been really great catching up
with my old war buddies.

364
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,154
Greer.

365
00:16:57,154 --> 00:16:59,604
You really do look old as hell.

366
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:04,713
That go how you thought
it would, Reaper?

367
00:17:04,713 --> 00:17:06,197
All we accomplished
was letting that guy know

368
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:07,509
we're coming for him.

369
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:09,338
Gonna be twice as hard
to take him out now.

370
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:16,069
It has been a long time
since I've tucked in a toddler.

371
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,554
- How'd it feel?
- Wonderful.

372
00:17:18,554 --> 00:17:20,660
I do think I tweaked my back
just a little bit.

373
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,558
Oh, no.

374
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,423
All right, we are gonna need
to make a list.

375
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:26,528
Yes, we are.

376
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:29,082
We need diapers, baby wipes.

377
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,359
Food--Cheerios.

378
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,636
Henry loved Cheerios.

379
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:32,810
Milk--we're out of milk.

380
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,674
And we need
some baby toys, probably?

381
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:36,055
Yeah, definitely toys.

382
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,678
And we need to do
some babyproofing,

383
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:40,645
'cause this is dangerous.

384
00:17:40,645 --> 00:17:42,061
Yeah, okay.

385
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,132
Anything big
should be pulled down.

386
00:17:44,132 --> 00:17:45,926
Uh, these corners
are really sharp.

387
00:17:45,926 --> 00:17:48,412
Pointy things, for sure.

388
00:17:48,412 --> 00:17:49,723
I'm regretting
those succulents now.

389
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:53,658
<i>How bad do you think this
is gonna screw the kid up?</i>

390
00:17:55,143 --> 00:17:58,249
Depends on what you saw
and where she goes from here.

391
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:00,665
Lila was older than Anna
when she saw me get attacked,

392
00:18:00,665 --> 00:18:04,048
but I always wonder how much
of that stayed with her.

393
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,325
She's one of the most
well-adjusted kids

394
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,016
I've ever met.
You got no worries there.

395
00:18:08,777 --> 00:18:11,193
Any clarity on the parents?

396
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:13,333
Mom had a suspended sentence
for possession.

397
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:15,370
Went through a diversion
program successfully

398
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,026
and seems to have been clean.

399
00:18:17,026 --> 00:18:18,925
Father was in and out of jail.

400
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:21,514
Couple drug cases,
one assault charge.

401
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:23,516
Is this their past
coming back?

402
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:26,139
Maybe.
Although they seemed

403
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,589
to turn things around
since Anna arrived.

404
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:31,558
Both parents were employed,
kept their noses clean.

405
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:33,940
All right, we should dig
into their financials.

406
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,149
Things might have gotten tight
with the kid in the picture.

407
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,324
Maybe the dad had
to reach back out

408
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:40,049
to some of his friends
in the drug business.

409
00:18:41,327 --> 00:18:42,707
Oh, uh, what's that?

410
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:43,915
Oh, it's Blair's jacket.

411
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,848
She left it in my car
last night.

412
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:48,057
Oh, do you mind if we, um, stop
by her office to drop it off?

413
00:18:48,057 --> 00:18:49,162
Who's Blair?

414
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,819
My therapist.

415
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:52,372
You went out
with your therapist last night?

416
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:53,822
No, we ran into each other.
It was just a drink.

417
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:55,720
Totally innocent.

418
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,515
Although I was picking up
some vibes.

419
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:59,483
That crosses so many lines.

420
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:01,209
You--you know that you're
not supposed to go out

421
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:02,589
with your therapist, right?

422
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:03,728
Well, me and Lil' Gurkin
used to hang out

423
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:04,936
with Dr. Shrink all the time.

424
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,731
Lil'--D--
so wait, wait, wait, what?

425
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:08,526
Dr. Shrink.
That was my last therapist.

426
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:09,907
That's just what we called him.
- Okay.

427
00:19:09,907 --> 00:19:11,288
And was this therapist
licensed?

428
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:16,293
- No.
- What?

429
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:19,330
Hey, you think Blair left her
jacket in my car on purpose?

430
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,573
Like, to have an excuse
to see me again?

431
00:19:20,573 --> 00:19:22,851
She does have an excuse
to see you again.

432
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:25,094
Therapy.

433
00:19:25,094 --> 00:19:26,889
Yeah.

434
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:28,581
She is adorable.

435
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:30,755
She really is.

436
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,861
You know, when your child
grows up and leaves,

437
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:34,897
you don't just miss them.

438
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:37,728
You miss all
the versions of them

439
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:39,868
like they're all these separate
individual people.

440
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:42,077
You miss the--
the infant version,

441
00:19:42,077 --> 00:19:44,804
the toddler version,
the skinny 10-year-old version.

442
00:19:44,804 --> 00:19:46,668
And then the man
that Henry's become.

443
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:48,635
That's why people keep
having kids,

444
00:19:48,635 --> 00:19:50,361
to get back to those versions
they miss.

445
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:51,535
- Oh.

446
00:19:51,535 --> 00:19:53,399
They should develop
a time machine.

447
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:55,470
It'd certainly make
things simpler.

448
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,643
Mm. And cheaper.

449
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,058
And cheaper.

450
00:19:59,922 --> 00:20:01,269
Ah, it's Luna.
- Mm.

451
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:06,412
- Hey. Nice to see ya.
- Hey.

452
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:08,414
What's--what's wrong?

453
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:12,072
Anna's mom, Remi,
she died a little while ago.

454
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:20,909
So what happens now?

455
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:22,462
We don't have great options.

456
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:24,257
She'll end up at a shelter
for a week or two

457
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,741
until we can find
a foster family

458
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:27,985
that will take her in.

459
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:30,194
Unless--
- Unless what?

460
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:32,403
Unless you would be willing
to keep her

461
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:34,094
until we can place her
with a family.

462
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:37,581
What do you think about that?

463
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:39,065
I think that's a bad idea.

464
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,000
Would you give us
a minute, please?

465
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,208
Of course.

466
00:20:46,693 --> 00:20:48,005
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

467
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:49,386
No, not nothing.

468
00:20:49,386 --> 00:20:52,009
Any other day,
you are generous to a fault.

469
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:53,562
Well, it's--
it's not about that.

470
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:55,564
I-I want what's best for Anna.

471
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:58,464
And I think bonding with us
for a few weeks is only gonna

472
00:20:58,464 --> 00:21:00,397
damage her further
on the back end

473
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:02,675
when, you know,
they pull her away from us.

474
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:05,125
Okay. Maybe.

475
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,026
But that's not really
why you're hesitating, is it?

476
00:21:10,924 --> 00:21:13,375
When I was 15,
I was babysitting

477
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,689
for my four-year-old
neighbor, Ryan.

478
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:18,553
I got distracted for a second.

479
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:22,729
And when I turned around,
he was in the pool.

480
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:25,663
I jumped in.
I pulled him out.

481
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:26,837
He was fine.

482
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:30,012
But ever since then...

483
00:21:30,012 --> 00:21:33,740
I was almost the reason
my neighbors lost their son.

484
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,155
I'm not mom material.

485
00:21:35,155 --> 00:21:39,263
Okay.
Um, I disagree.

486
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:41,472
But I understand.

487
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:44,337
Let's just say goodbye to Anna.

488
00:21:46,512 --> 00:21:47,720
Wait.

489
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:52,518
Okay.
- Are you sure?

490
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:54,278
I don't want to do this
if you're not comfortable.

491
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:56,073
How can I make this about me

492
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:58,178
after everything
she's been through?

493
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:05,358
Luna, we will take Anna
until you find a family member

494
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,222
or a good foster home.
- That's amazing.

495
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:08,913
You're amazing for doing this.

496
00:22:08,913 --> 00:22:10,190
Oh, sorry, this is Wesley.

497
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,813
I'm just gonna grab this.
- Yeah.

498
00:22:11,813 --> 00:22:12,710
Hey, what's up?

499
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,229
Uh, "what's up?"

500
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:15,851
it's your deposition today,
Oscar's lawsuit.

501
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,475
Wesley, I completely forgot.
I am so sorry.

502
00:22:18,475 --> 00:22:19,890
Okay, I need you to start
putting these things

503
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,822
in your calendar.
<i>- I am.</i>

504
00:22:20,822 --> 00:22:22,030
I did. I have.

505
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,411
It's--it is.
I just--

506
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:25,205
I-I have so much going on.

507
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:27,069
Look, it's clearly
a frivolous case,

508
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:28,174
but until I can
get it dismissed,

509
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:29,486
you need
to take this seriously.

510
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:30,556
No, you're absolutely right.

511
00:22:30,556 --> 00:22:32,489
I-I am on my way.

512
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:34,076
Crap.

513
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:36,009
Oscar's deposition, I forgot.

514
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:37,079
It should only take
a couple of hours.

515
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,357
I'm so sorry to leave you.

516
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,392
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Are you sure?

517
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:40,807
I could try
to take her with me.

518
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,222
Yeah, don't be silly.
We'll be fine.

519
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:44,708
And I really want
this Oscar situation behind us.

520
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:45,847
You and me both.

521
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:52,371
Thorsen, Chen,
what's happenin'?

522
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,855
Smitty, I'm pretty sure
you're not supposed

523
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:55,926
to be getting in therapy
while you're on shift.

524
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:57,341
Oh, I'm not a patient here.

525
00:22:57,341 --> 00:22:59,205
It's where I come
to take my breaks.

526
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:01,345
Plus, they got
top-notch snackage

527
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:04,072
and the mood is super zen.

528
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:06,246
Yeah, pretty sure
that's not okay either.

529
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:07,696
Tomato, to-mah-to.

530
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:09,457
Snackage.

531
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:10,837
- That's a new one.
- Yeah, I know.

532
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:12,218
Officer Thorsen?

533
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:15,359
I don't have an appointment
with you today, do I?

534
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:17,844
No, I just, uh,
brought you your jacket.

535
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:19,674
Oh, you didn't have
to do that.

536
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:20,916
You could have just brought it
to our next session.

537
00:23:20,916 --> 00:23:22,539
Thought you might need it.

538
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:24,472
Never know, it might be
your favorite jacket.

539
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:26,025
Thanks.

540
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:27,267
That was nice of you.

541
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:35,655
Okay.
Well, back to work.

542
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:37,899
Okay, I'm confused.

543
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:39,452
Are you sure she was
flirting with you last night?

544
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,453
I thought she was.

545
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,627
Were you drinking?

546
00:23:41,627 --> 00:23:42,524
I only had one.

547
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:44,319
Oh.

548
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:46,079
Oh, no.

549
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,219
Am I that guy?
- What?

550
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:51,257
The one that thinks
every girl is hitting on him?

551
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:52,638
You know who we could ask?

552
00:23:52,638 --> 00:23:55,572
- Who?
- Celina.

553
00:23:55,572 --> 00:23:56,642
- Funny.
- I know.

554
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:58,022
- Yeah, funny.
- I'm hilarious.

555
00:23:58,022 --> 00:23:59,023
Bye, Smitty.

556
00:23:59,023 --> 00:24:00,197
<i>We're not killing him.</i>

557
00:24:00,197 --> 00:24:01,647
You are looking at this
all wrong.

558
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:03,096
Ray is already dead.

559
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:04,581
We're just making sure
he stays that way.

560
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:06,341
You can hide behind
that idea all you want,

561
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:07,584
but we both know
it'll give you no comfort

562
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:08,585
when the nightmares come.

563
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:09,620
So what?

564
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,483
We let him get away with it?

565
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:12,209
No.

566
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:14,176
We come clean--
about everything.

567
00:24:14,176 --> 00:24:16,351
Not a chance.
Ray is right.

568
00:24:16,351 --> 00:24:18,491
We say anything,
it'll blow up our lives.

569
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,562
I will lose my career,
my family.

570
00:24:20,562 --> 00:24:23,185
I wouldn't let that happen.
I'll take the fall.

571
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:24,566
I was squad leader.
It'll all be on me.

572
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:26,499
I signed those
after action reports too.

573
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:27,811
I'll say I made you sign 'em.

574
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:30,158
No one will buy it!

575
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:32,367
All right, you are gonna
lose everything,

576
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:36,198
destroy my life, and then
Ray will still be out there.

577
00:24:36,198 --> 00:24:39,995
There is only one way
out of this.

578
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:42,411
I can't.

579
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:44,552
And I won't let you.

580
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:47,900
You would arrest me
for killing that scumbag?

581
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,697
Yes.

582
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:57,150
Okay.

583
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,152
Then I'm out.

584
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:02,052
And whatever death and
destruction Ray causes next,

585
00:25:02,052 --> 00:25:03,812
that's on you.

586
00:25:16,825 --> 00:25:18,137
Well, it's undisputed
that Officer Nolan wanted

587
00:25:18,137 --> 00:25:20,380
to inflict pain
on Oscar Hutchinson.

588
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,485
Untrue.

589
00:25:21,485 --> 00:25:23,418
It is very much in dispute.

590
00:25:23,418 --> 00:25:26,145
Are we keeping you up,
Officer Nolan?

591
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:27,836
Is my client's life
not important to you?

592
00:25:27,836 --> 00:25:29,424
Sorry, no.

593
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:31,737
I've been pulling doubles
lately, and last night,

594
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:33,842
we took home a little girl
whose family had been murdered.

595
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:35,188
Please strike that
from the record.

596
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:37,328
Officer Nolan is clearly
trying to paint himself

597
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:38,537
in a positive light
for the court.

598
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,746
Not at all,
though I can understand

599
00:25:40,746 --> 00:25:43,403
how any act of generosity
you would see as manipulative.

600
00:25:43,403 --> 00:25:44,750
Let's get back on track.

601
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,269
Yes. Let's.

602
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:49,996
Officer Nolan, would you read
the highlighted text exchange

603
00:25:49,996 --> 00:25:53,068
from the day of the attack
on Oscar Hutchinson?

604
00:25:56,175 --> 00:25:58,487
"Why can't this guy just
get shanked in prison?"

605
00:25:58,487 --> 00:26:00,386
And who did you send
that text to?

606
00:26:00,386 --> 00:26:02,043
My girlfriend at the time,
Bailey Nune.

607
00:26:02,043 --> 00:26:03,009
And who were
you referring to?

608
00:26:03,009 --> 00:26:05,529
Who do you wish to see, quote,

609
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:07,220
"Shanked in prison"?

610
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,256
I don't wish to see anyone--

611
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,638
Just answer the question.

612
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:13,157
Who were you referring to
in the text?

613
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:14,365
Oscar Hutchinson.

614
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:15,919
But this was taken
out of context.

615
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,577
Under what context do
you wish to see my client dead?

616
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:19,992
And to what lengths
were you willing to go

617
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:21,338
to make sure that happened?

618
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:23,823
This is just a man
venting his frustration

619
00:26:23,823 --> 00:26:24,893
about work to his wife.

620
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:26,343
Nothing more.
- Mm.

621
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:27,655
Let's move on
to the second text,

622
00:26:27,655 --> 00:26:29,760
shall we, Officer Nolan,
if you please?

623
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:34,558
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, yes.

624
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:36,871
This is a cool fort,
don't you think?

625
00:26:36,871 --> 00:26:38,389
- Yes.
- And we can feel

626
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,806
really safe in here, huh?

627
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:43,843
I love seeing you smile.

628
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:45,569
You can line 'em all up.

629
00:26:47,502 --> 00:26:51,230
Yes.
Oh, I would love to sit closer.

630
00:26:54,129 --> 00:26:55,579
It's pretty cool in here, huh?

631
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:57,995
Yeah.

632
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:05,969
Oh, good, you're not dead.

633
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:07,798
- I'm sorry.
- Not good enough.

634
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:10,594
I've spent the last 36 hours
imagining you bleeding out

635
00:27:10,594 --> 00:27:12,423
at a variety
of Los Angeles landmarks.

636
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,149
I would have called you
if I could.

637
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:18,015
Telling me you're alive
is not optional.

638
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:21,260
What the hell are you into
that's making you so crazy?

639
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,020
- I can't tell you.
- Why?

640
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,366
Because even knowing about it
would put you at risk

641
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:25,782
with the department.

642
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:29,268
You committed a crime?

643
00:27:29,268 --> 00:27:31,166
No.

644
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,651
I mean, no, not--
not technically.

645
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,583
But you've done something
that I would be compelled

646
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:36,413
to report, and if I didn't,
I would get disciplined?

647
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:37,966
I'm not gonna have
my drama infect you.

648
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:39,140
Then what are you doing here?

649
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,660
I-I came to see you.

650
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,834
And what?

651
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:45,215
Order take-in?
Watch TV?

652
00:27:45,215 --> 00:27:46,561
Pretend like
nothing's going on?

653
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:47,907
No. I--

654
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:50,669
If you are not here
to tell me the truth...

655
00:27:53,913 --> 00:27:56,019
I need you to leave.

656
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:02,059
Understood.

657
00:28:08,652 --> 00:28:11,206
Hey, how are we doing
on the multiple homicides?

658
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:12,863
Yeah, we're coming up
empty so far.

659
00:28:12,863 --> 00:28:15,245
No eyewitnesses,
not a lot of doorbell cameras

660
00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:16,522
in that neighborhood.
- Yeah, and we talked

661
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:18,351
to some coworkers,
and they did confirm

662
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:19,698
that they had turned
their lives around.

663
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:23,011
Now a dead end on ballistics.

664
00:28:23,011 --> 00:28:25,151
No match.

665
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:26,532
No hits on any of the prints.

666
00:28:26,532 --> 00:28:28,499
We should expand
the canvassing area.

667
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:30,605
I'll add some units,
widen the grid.

668
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:33,401
Wait, uh,

669
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:35,990
it looks like the Hughes
got a payment

670
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,062
every third of the month
for $300

671
00:28:39,062 --> 00:28:40,753
like clockwork.

672
00:28:40,753 --> 00:28:42,134
Drug payments?

673
00:28:42,134 --> 00:28:43,514
Maybe the dad got back
in the game.

674
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,206
You know a lot of junkies
on a payment plan?

675
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:47,104
So... what?

676
00:28:48,623 --> 00:28:50,832
Rent check?

677
00:28:50,832 --> 00:28:52,696
I mean, they have had
money problems.

678
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:54,422
And that back room
felt different

679
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:55,526
than the rest of the house.

680
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,045
There were no personal items,

681
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:59,392
and it had a dead bolt on it.

682
00:28:59,392 --> 00:29:01,015
Maybe they took on a tenant.

683
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:02,499
A tenant that disappears

684
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:04,190
after an entire family
is slaughtered.

685
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,847
Looks like we have a suspect.

686
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,581
Hey, I need your help

687
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:17,169
figuring out what's
going on with Tim.

688
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:18,826
- Good morning.
- Morning.

689
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:20,689
Hi, how are you?
I'm fine. Thanks.

690
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:22,174
Um, that's a lie.

691
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:25,142
Okay, so two nights ago,

692
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:27,662
Tim got this crazy phone call
and then he disappeared.

693
00:29:27,662 --> 00:29:29,664
Then he called in sick.

694
00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:31,597
And now he says that
if he tells me what's going on,

695
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:33,219
I could get fired.

696
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:34,773
Well, then I--
I guess it's a good thing

697
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,602
he didn't tell you.

698
00:29:36,602 --> 00:29:38,915
Would you accept
that reasoning from Bailey?

699
00:29:38,915 --> 00:29:40,571
- No.
- Look, if I knew what was

700
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,815
going on, maybe I could help--
we could help.

701
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:43,954
Right.
But if he won't tell you,

702
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:45,645
I don't see what choice
you have.

703
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:49,373
What's going on?
- We ID'd the guy renting

704
00:29:49,373 --> 00:29:50,961
the back bedroom
from the Hughes.

705
00:29:50,961 --> 00:29:52,135
Midnight shift
brought him in.

706
00:29:52,135 --> 00:29:53,826
- Uh, I have to--
- N-no, of course.

707
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:54,965
Good luck.
- Okay, you too.

708
00:29:54,965 --> 00:29:56,518
And I'm here if you need me.

709
00:30:00,626 --> 00:30:04,354
All right, we got warm milk,
sound machine.

710
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:07,012
We are ready for nap.

711
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,913
Anna?

712
00:30:13,742 --> 00:30:15,158
Anna?

713
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:19,162
Sweetie?
Come on out, sweetie.

714
00:30:19,162 --> 00:30:20,888
We're not playing
hide-and-seek.

715
00:30:25,996 --> 00:30:27,826
Anna?

716
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,416
Anna?

717
00:30:34,936 --> 00:30:37,076
Anna. Honey.

718
00:30:43,048 --> 00:30:44,221
Oh, my God.

719
00:30:44,221 --> 00:30:45,222
Where's John?

720
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:50,124
<i>Hi, it's John Nolan.</i>

721
00:30:50,124 --> 00:30:51,125
<i>Leave a message at the beep.</i>

722
00:30:53,713 --> 00:30:55,267
Anna, sweetie.

723
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:02,136
Oh, sweetie.

724
00:31:02,136 --> 00:31:03,965
You had me so scared.

725
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:05,760
Oh, come here.

726
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,177
Oh, sweetie, I was so scared.

727
00:31:09,177 --> 00:31:11,145
Okay.

728
00:31:11,145 --> 00:31:13,975
Oh, it's kind of nice in here.

729
00:31:13,975 --> 00:31:15,804
I actually get why you like it.

730
00:31:20,085 --> 00:31:21,396
<i>Where were you
night before last?</i>

731
00:31:21,396 --> 00:31:22,984
<i>Uh, I was at home
with my wife.</i>

732
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:24,641
You can call her.
She'll tell you.

733
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:27,920
What's your relationship
to the Hughes?

734
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,888
Ellis and I go way back.

735
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,304
Uh, I work in Brentwood,
live in Victorville.

736
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:34,064
<i>It's about a two-hour drive
on a good day.</i>

737
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:36,032
I rent a room from them
on the nights that I work late.

738
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:39,173
But I swear,
I would never hurt them.

739
00:31:39,173 --> 00:31:41,175
You know what happened?

740
00:31:41,175 --> 00:31:43,418
It's all over the news.

741
00:31:43,418 --> 00:31:44,833
Is Anna okay?

742
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:45,938
She's safe.

743
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,081
Look, I--I know
I should have came forward

744
00:31:51,081 --> 00:31:53,394
and said something, but, look,

745
00:31:53,394 --> 00:31:55,223
I saw what he did to them,
and I was scared.

746
00:31:55,223 --> 00:31:56,742
He?

747
00:31:56,742 --> 00:31:58,986
Yeah, Bad Rod.

748
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:03,576
Ellis won a lottery ticket
a couple days ago,

749
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:06,959
was bragging how he hit big,
and Rod seemed real interested.

750
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,756
I couldn't find her.

751
00:32:10,756 --> 00:32:13,069
And suddenly, I was 15 again,

752
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:15,554
and that little boy
was face down in the pool.

753
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:17,349
I can't believe I ever thought
I could do this.

754
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:22,147
I understand how that trauma
could imprint on you.

755
00:32:22,147 --> 00:32:24,735
But that little boy was okay,

756
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:25,978
and so is Anna.

757
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:28,774
I am terrified
I'm gonna fail her.

758
00:32:28,774 --> 00:32:30,120
We all are.

759
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,571
One time, I accidentally
slammed Dominique's finger

760
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:34,331
in the sliding glass door.

761
00:32:34,331 --> 00:32:36,920
I can still hear her scream.
- Mm.

762
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,680
You don't have to be perfect

763
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,751
to take care
of this little girl.

764
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,340
You just have to care enough

765
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,378
to get through
the scary moments.

766
00:32:46,378 --> 00:32:49,588
But I can take her with me,
if you want.

767
00:32:49,588 --> 00:32:51,555
No judgment whatsoever.

768
00:32:55,904 --> 00:32:58,010
No. Let her sleep.

769
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:01,945
You got this.

770
00:33:01,945 --> 00:33:03,567
A lottery ticket?

771
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,362
That's why he killed
that little girl's family?

772
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:08,331
Not even a lottery ticket,
a scratch-off for $1,500.

773
00:33:08,331 --> 00:33:11,023
If he's willing to kill
three people for $1,500,

774
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:12,542
what's he gonna do
to stay out of prison?

775
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:15,407
All right, Nolan, Juarez,
you two cover the back.

776
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:17,478
You three take the front.

777
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,135
If he doesn't go quietly,
we hold the perimeter

778
00:33:19,135 --> 00:33:20,412
and let SWAT do their thing.

779
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:21,378
All right, go.

780
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,993
Mom's probably been searched
a dozen times,

781
00:33:49,993 --> 00:33:51,581
tired of having a gun
stuck in her face.

782
00:33:51,581 --> 00:33:53,548
You wanna low-key this?

783
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:55,171
All right,
we're gonna low-key this.

784
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:57,069
Roderick may not be home,
and we don't want to traumatize

785
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,898
this woman any more
than we have to.

786
00:33:58,898 --> 00:34:00,176
Roger that.
We're in position.

787
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:01,694
No movement in the house.

788
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:11,911
LAPD. Mrs. Eaves?

789
00:34:11,911 --> 00:34:13,465
We have a search warrant
for this house

790
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:16,985
and an arrest warrant
for Roderick Eaves.

791
00:34:16,985 --> 00:34:18,021
He's not here.

792
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:19,574
That's what that sign says.

793
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:21,197
I haven't seen or heard
from him in months.

794
00:34:21,197 --> 00:34:23,475
So don't go tearing up
my house.

795
00:34:23,475 --> 00:34:24,752
A search warrant
isn't a choice, ma'am.

796
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:25,822
Please step outside.

797
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:30,896
Uh, floor gets creaky
after I vacuum.

798
00:34:30,896 --> 00:34:31,862
Yeah, that's not a thing.

799
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,761
Come here.

800
00:34:33,761 --> 00:34:35,142
We have movement inside.

801
00:34:35,142 --> 00:34:36,522
Perimeter hold.
We are making entry.

802
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:42,873
What the hell is he shooting?

803
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,979
High-velocity slug rounds.

804
00:34:44,979 --> 00:34:46,532
Control, we have
a barricaded suspect

805
00:34:46,532 --> 00:34:48,051
with some type of long gun.

806
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:49,501
Send SWAT to our location.

807
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,403
I got an open window.
You want tear gas?

808
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:56,439
Do it.

809
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:08,727
Cover me.

810
00:35:43,348 --> 00:35:44,590
Clear.

811
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:47,869
Control, Code 4.

812
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:49,181
We have suspect in custody.

813
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:52,011
Mobilize an RA unit for a GSW.

814
00:35:52,011 --> 00:35:52,805
All right.
Everyone okay?

815
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:54,186
All in one piece.

816
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:00,296
Hey, hey.
You okay?

817
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:01,918
Heard it got a little dicey
out there today.

818
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:03,506
Oh, yeah.
A bit of a soup sandwich,

819
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:05,197
but we all came out all right.

820
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:06,164
All over
a scratch-off ticket?

821
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,751
- Yeah.

822
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,477
Oh, hey, I got
some good news for you.

823
00:36:09,477 --> 00:36:11,065
Oscar died?

824
00:36:11,065 --> 00:36:12,894
You have to stop
joking like that.

825
00:36:12,894 --> 00:36:13,999
Even though he stabbed you?

826
00:36:13,999 --> 00:36:15,414
Yeah, fair enough.

827
00:36:15,414 --> 00:36:17,209
A judge granted
the motion to dismiss.

828
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:19,315
- So it's over?
- For you.

829
00:36:19,315 --> 00:36:21,213
The judge said you had
the lowest tier of culpability.

830
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:22,835
The sheriff stationed
outside the hospital room

831
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:25,044
was primarily responsible
for Oscar's safety.

832
00:36:25,044 --> 00:36:26,218
- Wesley, that is great.
- Yeah.

833
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,875
- Thank you.
- I'd say get some sleep,

834
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,083
but I know you got a toddler

835
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,222
at your house, so--
- Oh, yeah, no.

836
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,016
Sleep is out the window.
- Ooh, yeah.

837
00:36:32,914 --> 00:36:35,054
I need to clear the air
on something.

838
00:36:35,054 --> 00:36:37,885
Um, look, the other night--

839
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:39,197
Totally my fault.

840
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,337
I should never have said yes
to that drink.

841
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:43,822
It was a violation of
our professional relationships,

842
00:36:43,822 --> 00:36:46,238
and I could get
into a lot of trouble.

843
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:48,378
T-trust me, you won't.
I would never narc you out.

844
00:36:48,378 --> 00:36:50,173
I know that,
but I never should have

845
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:52,658
put you in a position
to make that choice.

846
00:36:52,658 --> 00:36:55,074
I understand if you want
to switch therapists.

847
00:36:55,074 --> 00:36:56,248
No.

848
00:36:56,248 --> 00:36:58,077
No, not at all.

849
00:36:58,077 --> 00:37:01,460
Look, you are the first person

850
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,291
that I've ever felt
comfortable opening up to,

851
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:06,638
and I can't lose that.

852
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:08,295
You know, so no matter the--

853
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:10,331
the physical attraction
we felt--

854
00:37:10,331 --> 00:37:12,713
Aaron.

855
00:37:12,713 --> 00:37:16,510
I need to make this very clear.

856
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:20,652
There was and is no attraction
on my end.

857
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:22,101
I need you to understand that.

858
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:26,174
Understood. Yeah.

859
00:37:26,174 --> 00:37:29,074
Uh, glad we cleared the air
on that.

860
00:37:29,074 --> 00:37:31,249
See you next session.

861
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,250
Have a good week.

862
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,872
Thank you.
You too.

863
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,679
What are you doing?

864
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,888
Nothing.
I am not calling,

865
00:37:49,888 --> 00:37:52,822
not searching, not stalking.

866
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:56,826
I'm just being a good
girlfriend and trusting my man.

867
00:37:56,826 --> 00:37:59,277
Worst country song ever.

868
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,554
Still no word?

869
00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:01,727
I mean, we talked last night.

870
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:03,211
That's good.

871
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:04,972
More like I got heated
and he just stood there,

872
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:06,560
so I don't know.

873
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,182
I'm at a loss.
- I've got an idea.

874
00:38:08,182 --> 00:38:09,839
Let's put a tracker
on his truck.

875
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,324
You--you are
a bad influence.

876
00:38:12,324 --> 00:38:13,912
No. You're just
a really good teacher.

877
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:15,534
Wh-what?

878
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:16,984
You think I haven't learned
a thing or two

879
00:38:16,984 --> 00:38:19,020
living with a cop
who aced undercover school?

880
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,402
Okay.
What have you learned?

881
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:23,024
Never hold your coffee
with your gun hand.

882
00:38:23,024 --> 00:38:24,819
Yes, that is actually
very useful.

883
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:26,200
However, you do not have a gun.

884
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,339
So what else?

885
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,892
Keep your head on a swivel.

886
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:30,238
What is this?

887
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:31,826
- Oh, balance.

888
00:38:31,826 --> 00:38:32,827
Good.

889
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:42,354
<i>♪ In my prayer,
I don't speak ♪</i>

890
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:47,221
<i>♪ But with my hands
and on my knees ♪</i>

891
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:51,570
<i>♪ When I ask, I receive</i>

892
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:55,471
<i>♪ Don't play fair,
don't be sweet ♪</i>

893
00:38:55,471 --> 00:39:00,268
<i>♪ It's in the air

894
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:04,342
<i>♪ Understand it's

895
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:09,001
<i>♪ Well, in my head,
it's in my sleep ♪</i>

896
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:12,073
<i>♪ With my hands, in my teeth</i>

897
00:39:12,073 --> 00:39:13,454
Oh, my gosh.

898
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:15,214
I love what you've done here.

899
00:39:15,214 --> 00:39:18,494
I see a pig,
but I also see a cat.

900
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:20,875
More of a pig-cat.

901
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,394
Kind of brilliant.

902
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:23,395
She's brilliant.

903
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,223
Okay.

904
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:26,536
Pardon me.

905
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:29,884
Let's do it.

906
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:31,886
- Do what?
- Foster her.

907
00:39:31,886 --> 00:39:33,509
I know we decided not
to have kids,

908
00:39:33,509 --> 00:39:35,096
but this feels like fate.

909
00:39:35,096 --> 00:39:36,512
Yeah. No, it does.

910
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:38,065
Are y--are you sure
you're all right with this?

911
00:39:38,065 --> 00:39:40,101
Yeah.
I-I-I mean, I'm terrified,

912
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:41,586
but I can run
into burning buildings.

913
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:42,897
I can do this.

914
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,347
Of course you can.
This is gonna be great.

915
00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:45,797
- Yes.
- This is gonna be so great.

916
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:47,833
Yes.

917
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:50,042
both: Hi.
- Come in.

918
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:52,044
Hi.
- Great news.

919
00:39:52,044 --> 00:39:53,701
John, Bailey,
this is Don Hughes,

920
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:55,323
Anna's uncle from Tampa.

921
00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:57,222
- Oh, great to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

922
00:39:57,222 --> 00:40:00,018
He's gonna take Anna
to live with him.

923
00:40:00,018 --> 00:40:02,330
That's--that's fantastic.

924
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,642
Yeah.

925
00:40:03,642 --> 00:40:05,679
Thank you so much
for taking care of her.

926
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:06,852
Oh, no, of course. Yeah.

927
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:09,337
- She's amazing.
- Yeah, she's been great.

928
00:40:11,857 --> 00:40:12,927
Hey, sweetheart.

929
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:14,515
How you doing?

930
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:17,138
- Aw.
- Aw. Fantastic.

931
00:40:17,138 --> 00:40:20,970
This is goodbye,
so high fives, little one.

932
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,799
Bye, sweetie.

933
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:24,249
Yeah.

934
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:25,837
Let me get her settled
in the rental.

935
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:27,459
I'm gonna head right
to the airport.

936
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,047
- Okay.
- Come on.

937
00:40:29,047 --> 00:40:30,876
- Ready?

938
00:40:42,612 --> 00:40:43,993
You both did an amazing job.

939
00:40:43,993 --> 00:40:45,753
I can't thank you enough.

940
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:56,074
You okay?

941
00:40:56,074 --> 00:40:57,385
No.

942
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:00,941
Yeah, me too.

943
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:40,083
<i>Damn it.</i>
