1
00:00:02,347 --> 00:00:03,796
We made it!

2
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:06,040
Say "honeymoon day one."

3
00:00:06,178 --> 00:00:09,699
Honeymoon day one!

4
00:00:09,837 --> 00:00:11,114
Are you taking a picture?

5
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:12,426
Video.

6
00:00:12,564 --> 00:00:14,014
I wanted to see how long
until you broke.

7
00:00:14,152 --> 00:00:15,360
Hi. I'm Rafael.

8
00:00:15,498 --> 00:00:17,051
- Hello!
- That's my daughter, Elise.

9
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:18,570
Elise, hi, I'm John.
That's Bailey.

10
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:19,950
- Hello!
- Hi.

11
00:00:20,089 --> 00:00:21,607
And we run
the Oceanside Dreams.

12
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:23,540
I know that you booked
our luxury villa.

13
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:24,817
- Yeah.
- Yes.

14
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:26,026
So let's get you
in there, yeah?

15
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:27,303
Oh, I like
the sound of luxury.

16
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,581
You did say, villa, right?

17
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,238
Yes. Yes, sir.

18
00:00:31,376 --> 00:00:33,723
We're still recovering
from the last few hurricanes.

19
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:35,621
The power goes out sometimes.

20
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,453
The internet works sometimes.

21
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:42,766
But to us,
this is still paradise.

22
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:44,078
Totally.

23
00:00:44,216 --> 00:00:46,563
It's just that the pictures
on the website,

24
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:48,082
they look a little different.

25
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,911
Yes, exactly.

26
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,673
We used AI
to generate renderings.

27
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:55,434
So those are photos of
what the place feels like,

28
00:00:55,572 --> 00:00:57,229
yeah, according to the AI.

29
00:00:57,367 --> 00:00:59,611
That's what separates us
from the other resorts.

30
00:00:59,749 --> 00:01:00,853
The false advertising?

31
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:03,787
What was that?

32
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:05,720
Oh, um...

33
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:08,551
possums, most likely.

34
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,415
They are loud.

35
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:12,244
But rest assured,
if you hear anything at all,

36
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:15,765
it's either a mating sound
or a killing sound.

37
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:17,905
Happy honeymoon.

38
00:01:18,043 --> 00:01:21,253
OK.

39
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,254
That's good.

40
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:23,600
No, this is gonna be great.

41
00:01:23,738 --> 00:01:25,292
- Mm-hmm.
- This is--

42
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,328
I am so sorry.

43
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,468
<i>♪ I'm gonna win for you ♪</i>

44
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:33,023
<i>♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪</i>

45
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:39,237
Hey, did you get any sleep?

46
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,929
I will sleep
when I pass this exam.

47
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,206
Yeah.

48
00:01:43,344 --> 00:01:44,759
I don't think
you're gonna sleep more

49
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:46,140
after you make detective.

50
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:47,452
How's it going?

51
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,764
I feel pretty good
about my knowledge.

52
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:51,835
I mean, the written
portion was easy.

53
00:01:51,973 --> 00:01:54,735
But the oral exam
is what is literally

54
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,323
keeping me up at night.

55
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:58,739
I mean, the test
is so subjective.

56
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:01,121
If even one person on the panel
has it against me,

57
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,467
I mean, it's over.

58
00:02:02,605 --> 00:02:04,020
And you think Lieutenant
Primm still hates you?

59
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:05,470
I brought him
homemade cookies,

60
00:02:05,608 --> 00:02:06,678
and he threw them in the trash.

61
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:08,887
OK. You can't control Primm.

62
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:11,476
You can only control you.

63
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:12,925
And now it's time for you

64
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:14,168
to step away
from the highlighter.

65
00:02:14,306 --> 00:02:15,721
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

66
00:02:15,859 --> 00:02:17,516
That's exactly right, though.
See?

67
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:20,968
Because I can only control me,
so I just need to be perfect.

68
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:22,314
You can over-prepare.

69
00:02:22,452 --> 00:02:24,765
No, that is an idea
that lazy people created.

70
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,491
No, I've seen it happen, OK?

71
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:28,286
You get in your own head.

72
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:32,462
You just need to trust yourself
and then let it go.

73
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:36,432
Yeah, I don't think
I can do that.

74
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,847
All right.

75
00:02:37,985 --> 00:02:39,124
I'm gonna take a shower.

76
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:40,332
Right now?

77
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,023
Yeah.

78
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,680
Well--

79
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,822
Hmm, maybe
I could take a break.

80
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:52,551
It was a wedding, you know.

81
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:56,521
Everything was all romantic--
music, soft light--

82
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,697
and I kind of...

83
00:03:00,835 --> 00:03:02,492
kissed Celina.

84
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,770
Celina, who you work with?

85
00:03:04,908 --> 00:03:07,221
Celina, who saved your life
when you were shot?

86
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,050
That Celina?
- Yeah.

87
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,087
Did I mention the light?

88
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:12,744
Because I really believe,
like, the mood lighting

89
00:03:12,882 --> 00:03:14,159
was 20% responsible.

90
00:03:14,297 --> 00:03:15,229
How did she react?

91
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:16,782
Not good.

92
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,026
Yeah, the look she gave me was
somewhere between horrified

93
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:22,029
and really horrified.

94
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,927
She doesn't share
your feelings?

95
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:28,760
I'm not sure I share
my feelings, you know.

96
00:03:28,898 --> 00:03:31,901
We've been so close,
and she was the only person

97
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,351
I could talk to.
- Look.

98
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,249
It's very natural to
confuse that kind of bond

99
00:03:35,387 --> 00:03:36,561
with something romantic.

100
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,425
OK. So--so what do I do?

101
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:39,874
How do I fix this?

102
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:42,877
You and Celina have been
through a lot together.

103
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,465
You have a shared trauma.

104
00:03:44,603 --> 00:03:45,777
And as tempting as it is

105
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:47,710
to want everything fixed
overnight,

106
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:50,333
that's not how
these things work.

107
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,093
Now, when you say trauma,
are you talking

108
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,613
about Celina rejecting me
or me getting shot?

109
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:58,790
Because they have been equally
traumatizing in my eyes.

110
00:03:58,928 --> 00:04:00,723
You're both adults.

111
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:02,345
Clear the air.

112
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:04,968
Set some healthy boundaries
and give her time.

113
00:04:05,106 --> 00:04:07,247
OK.

114
00:04:09,973 --> 00:04:13,253
Are we starting an OnlyFans?

115
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:15,669
I thought we would
want to remember

116
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:16,946
this honeymoon forever.

117
00:04:17,084 --> 00:04:19,431
Now of course, I'm not so sure.

118
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,157
Is this a button cam?

119
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,158
Mm-hmm.

120
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,504
- A drone?
- Mm-hmm.

121
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:25,541
Are we launching
an intelligence agency?

122
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:30,373
It came as a package,
and it was on sale.

123
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:32,789
And I got excited.

124
00:04:32,927 --> 00:04:34,032
Can I show you?

125
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,172
This one is waterproof.

126
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,933
It makes it perfect
for swimming, kayaking.

127
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,211
Or we can do that thing where
we go cage diving with sharks.

128
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,765
We can't.
They don't have it here.

129
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:44,076
- Oh.
- I made sure.

130
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:47,114
This one attaches right to us.

131
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:49,841
So when we go zip lining
and you're zipping on past

132
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,670
and I'm watching
from the ground,

133
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:54,155
we can cut into it later from
all sorts of different angles.

134
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,158
OK, and this one is
a button camera in case

135
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,608
we have to go undercover,

136
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,817
break up any monkey
drug cartels.

137
00:05:00,955 --> 00:05:02,371
And what about this one?

138
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,338
Oh, why is it so dark?

139
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:05,995
Hang on a second.

140
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:07,548
Night vision.
- No.

141
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:08,756
- Yes.
- No.

142
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,344
Totally.
Just listen.

143
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:11,690
Listen.

144
00:05:11,828 --> 00:05:14,314
I was thinking we can take
one of these, set it up,

145
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:16,143
you know, outside.

146
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:17,800
See what the possums are doing.

147
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:19,422
Oh, yeah, totally,
that's what you were thinking.

148
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,492
It is what I was thinking.

149
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,700
What were you thinking?

150
00:05:21,838 --> 00:05:22,839
I think you know
what I was thinking.

151
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:24,807
- Hey, I'm married.

152
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:30,813
Celina, hi!

153
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:32,849
Aaron.

154
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:34,886
Are you cleared
for active duty?

155
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:36,681
No, uh, not yet.

156
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,408
Soon.

157
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:42,238
I, um--
I got something for you.

158
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,377
Picked it up
on the way to work.

159
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:45,552
Oh.
No, you didn't have to do that.

160
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,416
Surprise. New laptop.

161
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:51,281
Aaron, that's
completely unnecessary.

162
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,388
Yeah, but you were saying
how your computer was slow.

163
00:05:54,526 --> 00:05:56,045
I know what you're doing.

164
00:05:56,183 --> 00:06:00,152
You're trying
to apologize for the--

165
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,224
for the kiss,
but you don't have to.

166
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,571
OK?

167
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,504
OK.

168
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:10,680
Yeah.

169
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:13,959
Anybody want a laptop?

170
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:15,582
Yeah. Yeah, I'll take it!

171
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,239
The murder scene exception
is the misbelief

172
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,897
that when a crime scene
is so heinous,

173
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:23,106
you are allowed to go
around the search warrant.

174
00:06:23,244 --> 00:06:25,281
Correct again.
Next question.

175
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:27,697
What is my favorite
leisure activity?

176
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:29,216
Um, excuse me?

177
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:31,943
You know, am I more
of an outdoor or indoor cat?

178
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:35,878
Smitty, please just read
from the cards I gave you, OK?

179
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:37,397
Look, you asked me
for my advice.

180
00:06:37,535 --> 00:06:38,398
I did not!

181
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:39,640
And my advice is,

182
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:41,159
you should do
a little research on Primm.

183
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:44,438
Find out his likes,
his dislikes, favorite hobbies.

184
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:46,406
Then you can take
that knowledge

185
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:49,167
and score some bonus points.

186
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:52,412
I'm worried that
I focused too much on Aaron

187
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,484
after the attack
and did you a disservice,

188
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,520
let you fall
through the cracks.

189
00:06:57,658 --> 00:06:58,832
Oh, thank you, sir,

190
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,903
but I'm fine.

191
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:04,424
What about the wedding?

192
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:05,666
You went rogue.

193
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:08,013
You know better
than to meet with a CI

194
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,946
without alerting
other officers.

195
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:11,258
I do.
I just thought that--

196
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:13,260
It would impress me?

197
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,504
Yes.

198
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:16,815
Well, it didn't.

199
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:18,990
That situation could
have ended a lot worse.

200
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:21,337
Don't ever do it again.
- Yes, ma'am.

201
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,477
Harper is needed
back with the detectives.

202
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:25,824
He'll be riding with Sergeant
Bradford until Nolan returns.

203
00:07:25,962 --> 00:07:27,516
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

204
00:07:27,654 --> 00:07:29,449
Get the war bags, Boot.
Set up the shop.

205
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:33,487
He's a major dog guy.

206
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,040
He goes to the shelter
every weekend

207
00:07:35,178 --> 00:07:36,559
looking for new ones to foster.

208
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,596
And he won't stop
until he sets them up

209
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,252
with their forever homes.

210
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:42,047
Wait, what--
that is beautiful.

211
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:43,497
I am also a dog lover.

212
00:07:43,635 --> 00:07:44,878
What's going on here?

213
00:07:45,016 --> 00:07:46,845
I'm helping Chen study
for her detective's exam.

214
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:48,191
Smitty.

215
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:49,503
What happened
to not over-preparing?

216
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:51,678
It's Smitty.
Is it even really helping?

217
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:52,851
What?

218
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,335
I just need a few minutes.

219
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,372
No, you need to take a break.

220
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,822
I got Celina today.

221
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,237
Come on. You're riding with us.

222
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,549
Oh!

223
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:02,033
Well, that actually sounds
kind of fun.

224
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:03,931
The second you two start
talking about birth charts,

225
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,346
I'm kicking you both
out of the car.

226
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,417
OK.
Thank you, Smitty, thank you.

227
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,766
I've done all I can do.

228
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:12,837
The rest is up to her.

229
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,564
Right.

230
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:17,151
Elise was right.

231
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,740
This place is beautiful!

232
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:22,536
And all we really need
is each other, you know?

233
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:24,193
Oh! Unbelievable.

234
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:25,574
What?

235
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:27,403
Oh, I'm just checking
the possum camera, man.

236
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,853
They were really going at it.

237
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,751
Fighting or... you know?

238
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:32,201
I thought we were
the only ones staying

239
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:33,582
on this end of the island.

240
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,102
Uh, maybe he got here
after us?

241
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,483
He looks introspective.

242
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:40,174
He looks like a vampire

243
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,762
trying to avoid sunlight
at all costs.

244
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,763
Oh.

245
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:43,764
- Oh.
- Oh.

246
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:44,765
Oh!

247
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:46,871
I wasn't expecting that.

248
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:48,907
Just because you brought
all the cameras

249
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:50,944
doesn't mean you can use them
all the time.

250
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:52,393
You're totally right.

251
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,636
Be in the moment.

252
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:55,258
No, it's--I can hear
what you're saying.

253
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:56,259
Oh.

254
00:08:56,397 --> 00:08:58,089
Wait a second.

255
00:08:58,227 --> 00:08:59,573
Update.

256
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:01,402
He is not a vampire.

257
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,785
He is eating... avocado toast?

258
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:06,994
So who do you think he is?

259
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:11,481
Uh, I'm gonna go with
billionaire playboy

260
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,345
faking his own death,
went under the knife

261
00:09:13,483 --> 00:09:15,175
to change his features
to start a new life

262
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:16,590
with a secret second family.

263
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:19,282
Billionaire?
But he chose to stay here.

264
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,457
Oh. Yeah, maybe he's lost.

265
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,839
I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No, no, no, wait.

266
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:25,634
What if he just wants
to be left alone?

267
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:27,774
Or even worse, he doesn't
want to be left alone,

268
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:30,121
and then we have a third wheel
for the rest of our honeymoon.

269
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:32,813
I just want
to get a read on him.

270
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:34,056
And don't worry,
I'll make it sound

271
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:35,816
like we're old and no fun.

272
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:38,647
By the time I'm done, he won't
want to be anywhere near us.

273
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:40,269
OK.

274
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:42,754
You can make us sound
a little fun.

275
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:44,100
"Hi, I'm John Nolan.

276
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:48,449
That over there is
my stunning wife, Bailey."

277
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,830
"Oh!

278
00:09:49,968 --> 00:09:51,729
Wow, yes,
she is really beautiful."

279
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:53,351
"Yeah, she is.

280
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:55,767
"Did I also mention
she's talented and smart

281
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:57,493
and funny and--"

282
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,494
"That's so amazing.

283
00:09:58,632 --> 00:10:00,047
You're so lucky, dude."

284
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:02,394
I made sure my radio
batteries are charged up.

285
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:04,776
And I have a spare one here
too because you never know.

286
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:06,813
I threw an extra case
of water in the back, so--

287
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:08,021
Juarez.

288
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,126
I'll stop.

289
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:12,750
Hey, what's going on
with you and Aaron?

290
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:13,992
Nothing. Why?

291
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,166
Well, I saw you guys
in the parking lot,

292
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:17,271
and it looked awkward.

293
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,170
Huh, I don't know.

294
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,587
OK, just a little.
I just--whoa, whoa, whoa.

295
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,727
- Both of you, out now.
- Whoa.

296
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:25,901
You said no birth charts.

297
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,765
You didn't say we couldn't
talk about boys.

298
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:29,767
That goes without saying.

299
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:31,354
We will talk at lunch.

300
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:33,322
<i>Seven-Metro-one hundred,
I have a four-eighty-four</i>

301
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,600
<i>in progress at Bellevue
& East Kensington.</i>

302
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:37,533
Show us responding.

303
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:47,301
I've got this.

304
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,578
Sir!

305
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:50,615
I need you to stop right there.

306
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:53,169
Oh, is--is something
going on with--

307
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:55,171
Oh, we got a report
of someone shoplifting

308
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:56,897
at this location.

309
00:10:57,035 --> 00:10:58,105
Wasn't me.

310
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:00,245
Well, can you raise
your arms for me?

311
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:07,080
I'm sorry.

312
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:10,117
I just--my arm really hurt,

313
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:11,912
and I don't have any money.

314
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,500
OK, we need to get you
to the hospital.

315
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:15,364
What's your name?

316
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:16,917
I don't know.

317
00:11:17,055 --> 00:11:18,850
Well, it says here
your name is Jonathan Knight,

318
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:20,680
and you work
for Trusted Security.

319
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:22,854
Is that my name?

320
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:24,097
Jonathan Knight.

321
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:25,270
OK, drop the act.

322
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:26,306
Lying about your name
isn't gonna

323
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:27,583
keep us from arresting you.

324
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,378
Cuff him.
- No! No, no, no, no.

325
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:31,173
I--I woke up,
and I was just bleeding!

326
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:33,106
And I saw
the convenience store.

327
00:11:33,244 --> 00:11:36,765
I--I don't remember
anything from before that.

328
00:11:36,903 --> 00:11:38,698
All righty, let's go.

329
00:11:38,836 --> 00:11:41,390
Is that plaster dust?

330
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:43,116
I--I don't know.

331
00:11:45,221 --> 00:11:46,844
Are you buying any of this?

332
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:48,535
Not a word.

333
00:11:48,673 --> 00:11:50,261
I mean, the gash in his arm
is real enough.

334
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:52,884
- Oh!

335
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:56,681
I don't feel that good.

336
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:58,062
No, it's OK. It's OK.

337
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,822
We're gonna--we're gonna
take you to the hospital.

338
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,927
No, no.

339
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:02,376
Pukester is going
in an ambulance,

340
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:03,723
and you're going with him.

341
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:08,693
Can we talk about
that guy from breakfast?

342
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,213
I mean, that was weird.

343
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,663
When I asked him his name,
it took him a full five seconds

344
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:15,113
to tell me it was Dean.

345
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:16,425
It's probably
'cause he's on pain meds.

346
00:12:16,563 --> 00:12:19,221
Any kind of facial surgery
is quite serious.

347
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:20,601
I don't know.

348
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,534
Told me a wonky story
about a dog attack.

349
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:24,951
Something about it
just doesn't smell right.

350
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,919
Can you turn your cop brain
off for just a few hours

351
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,265
so we can go kayaking?

352
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:30,473
Of course I can.

353
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,752
Let me just land
this little beauty.

354
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,787
Oh.

355
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:35,099
- Don't be alarmed.
- Careful.

356
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:36,272
Lands with the touch
of a button.

357
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,240
Hey--ooh.

358
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:40,760
And I'm sorry.

359
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:43,521
Could you just state it
one more time for the record?

360
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,419
- You beat me.
- Uh-huh.

361
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:46,593
Which means?

362
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:49,458
Which means that I lost.

363
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:51,115
You really had
a staggering improvement.

364
00:12:51,253 --> 00:12:53,289
If you ever wanted
a second career change,

365
00:12:53,427 --> 00:12:54,704
you could be
a professional kayaker.

366
00:12:54,843 --> 00:12:55,740
Oh.

367
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:57,293
And what is the lesson here?

368
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:58,778
That don't make everything

369
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,125
a contest unless
I'm sure I can win.

370
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:03,921
That's right.

371
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:05,681
Did we leave that open?

372
00:13:07,545 --> 00:13:10,065
Maybe it was
like that before?

373
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:11,652
Yeah.

374
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,171
We were just too distracted

375
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,794
by the grandeur of this place
to notice?

376
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:18,383
What time is it?

377
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,834
It's 8:30.

378
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:22,974
Oh, perfect!

379
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,221
OK.

380
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,947
Just a second to lie down.

381
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:32,225
Then we'll grab some dinner.

382
00:13:48,897 --> 00:13:53,039
Bailey and I had somewhat
of a stressful morning.

383
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:55,869
The camera I left on
last night recorded

384
00:13:56,007 --> 00:13:59,183
someone standing outside
our window watching us sleep.

385
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,599
- For almost an hour.
- Right.

386
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:04,913
So I have charged
all the cameras.

387
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:07,225
We are setting up
a small but very

388
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,089
technologically advanced
perimeter.

389
00:14:09,227 --> 00:14:11,747
Let's see if he wants
to come back.

390
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:14,715
Watch me sleep now.

391
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,062

00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,243
It's on.

397
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:26,935
Are we being crazy?

398
00:14:27,073 --> 00:14:30,041
Somebody watched us sleep
last night for an hour.

399
00:14:30,179 --> 00:14:31,353
That's crazy.

400
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:34,287
Why can't we have,
like, a normal honeymoon?

401
00:14:34,425 --> 00:14:35,978
Tell you what, let's take
the first ferry out of here.

402
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:37,566
When we get home,
we're gonna book a trip

403
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:39,568
to the most normal place
we can find.

404
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:43,641
It's Elise.

405
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:44,987
Coming!

406
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,575

00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,128

- Housekeeping.

00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,267
Come on in.

409
00:14:49,405 --> 00:14:50,924
Brought you two
some fresh towels.

410
00:14:51,062 --> 00:14:52,443
Thank you.

411
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:54,928
Um, Elise, when is
the next ferry out of here?

412
00:14:55,066 --> 00:14:57,931
No ferry today
or tomorrow probably.

413
00:14:58,069 --> 00:15:00,485
It's about as reliable as
the internet and the power.

414
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:01,970
But I'm sure it'll be up
and running by the time

415
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,143
you guys check out.

416
00:15:03,281 --> 00:15:04,489
What if there was a problem?

417
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:05,974
Is there a problem?

418
00:15:06,112 --> 00:15:07,872
No, no. That's it.

419
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,805
Thank you.

420
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:11,738
OK, let me know
if you need anything else.

421
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:13,015

00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,333
Well, we are stuck here
for a few more days.

425
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:22,645
So we might as well
make the most of it.

426
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:24,993
Shall we go for a swim?
- Sure, of course.

427
00:15:25,131 --> 00:15:26,235
Yeah, let's make
the best of this.

428

431
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,000
Hey, Luna.
How's the new job going?

432
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:33,622
Energizing, mostly.

433
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,727
Being a patient advocate
is rewarding.

434
00:15:35,865 --> 00:15:38,109
Um, we're actually here
to check up on a patient

435
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:39,248
that we brought in yesterday.

436
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:40,249
He claimed to have amnesia.

437
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:41,561
Right.

438
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,149
The John Doe in 415.

439
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:45,116
I have called other hospitals,
homeless shelters,

440
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:47,498
rehab facilities--
anything I can think of.

441
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:49,534
No one has reported him
missing.

442
00:15:49,672 --> 00:15:51,640
Do the doctors think
he'll get his memory back?

443
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:52,882
Probably.

444
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:54,298
But brain injuries
can be tricky,

445
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:55,747
so it could be a few months.

446
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:56,783
OK. Thanks.

447
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,819
We'll go talk to him.

448
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,994
Hey, how's Aaron?

449
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:02,927
He's fine, I think.

450
00:16:03,065 --> 00:16:04,929
I--I don't know.

451
00:16:05,067 --> 00:16:06,137
I sense trouble.

452
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:07,690
No, no, not at all.

453
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,349
OK, maybe a little.

454
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:13,179
He kissed me at the wedding
out of nowhere.

455
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:16,009
And now I'm...

456
00:16:16,147 --> 00:16:17,079
Angry?

457
00:16:17,217 --> 00:16:18,115
Yeah.

458
00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:19,495
I think he was just confused.

459
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:21,187
And I mean, the way I reacted,

460
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:22,533
it must have been
so embarrassing.

461
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:25,018
And I'm sure he wants to forget
it ever happened.

462
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:27,296
I'm hearing a lot about
what you think Aaron's feeling.

463
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:30,679
But you can't know
until you talk it through.

464
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:35,511
- Hey.
- Mm.

465
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,273
Did you find something?

466
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:39,377
You know who I am?

467
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:40,930
I'm afraid not.

468
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,518
Look, we contacted
Trusted Security.

469
00:16:42,656 --> 00:16:43,933
They have never heard of you.

470
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:46,108
And we can't find
a Jonathan Knight

471
00:16:46,246 --> 00:16:48,248
matching your description
in California.

472
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,907
Well, I have been
thinking about it.

473
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:55,497
And I think the only
rational answer is that...

474
00:16:55,635 --> 00:16:57,188
I'm a spy.

475
00:16:57,913 --> 00:16:59,432
- Not my first guess.
- No.

476
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,951
No, it makes sense.
It's a cover identity.

477
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,712
I was probably
infiltrating a high-rise

478
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,403
full of government secrets.

479
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:06,611
Maybe I got poisoned.

480
00:17:06,749 --> 00:17:08,096
That's why I threw up.

481
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:10,305
You know, like radiation
poisoning or something?

482
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:12,652
Yeah, you know,
let's not jump to conclusions.

483
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,138
You probably threw up
because you're concussed.

484
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:18,934
Korea. North Korea.

485
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,832
Wait, it's all
coming back to me now.

486
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,903
I--I was targeting North Korea.

487
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,390
And I had a partner,
and we were on a mission.

488
00:17:26,528 --> 00:17:27,874
Do you know where he is?

489
00:17:28,012 --> 00:17:29,082
He could be in danger.

490
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,428
We need to find him.

491
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:32,396
Um, do you know
your partner's name

492
00:17:32,534 --> 00:17:34,329
or when you last saw him?

493
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:39,817
- No.
- Mm.

494
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:42,923
OK, we're on it.

495
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,718
We'll get back to you.

496
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,067
You turned off the TV?

497
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:49,792
Any chance he's right?

498
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,208
We ran his prints.

499
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:52,381
If he worked
for a three-letter agency,

500
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,486
it would have set off alarms.

501
00:17:53,624 --> 00:17:55,108
Yeah. I mean, maybe.

502
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,593
But the way he talked about
his partner, that felt real.

503
00:17:57,731 --> 00:17:59,457
Maybe there's some
kernel of truth there.

504
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,010
You saw the news.

505
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:02,495
He's just repeating
the last thing he saw on TV.

506
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:04,945
Maybe there's some
memory that's surfacing,

507
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,534
and he just can't make sense
of what it really means.

508
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:08,811
Maybe.

509
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:10,089
Regardless, there's not
much we can do

510
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:11,400
until he starts
to remember more.

511
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:12,608
Mm.

512
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:19,960
Excuse me.

513
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,101
Have you seen
Officers Bradford and Chen?

514
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:23,481
Mm-mm.

515
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:25,621
Then I'm in trouble.

516
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,313
Look at this.

517
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,627
There she is.

518
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:34,458
So nice.

519
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:36,149
Oh.

520
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,842
Bailey!

521
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:44,053
Normal honeymoon!

522
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:47,022
Just wanted a normal honeymoon.

523
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:49,680
OK.

524
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,630
OK.
This is John Nolan, LAPD.

525
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:10,804
With me is Bailey Nune, EMT.

526
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,704
We have just discovered
a dead body.

527
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:16,534
Uh, female, 30s, Martha--

528
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:17,880
Oh, Delgado.

529
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:19,365
Her body is still stiff.

530
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:20,883
She's been dead
for at least eight hours.

531
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:23,714
Wasn't in the water long enough
to sustain much damage.

532
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:25,267
It's such a tragedy.

533
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,511
I gotta say, it's not as
uncommon as you might think.

534
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:28,753
What do you mean?

535
00:19:28,891 --> 00:19:30,721
Well, even people
who grew up here,

536
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:32,723
they sometimes
underestimate the undertow.

537
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:35,898
They have a few drinks,
they go for a night swim,

538
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:38,556
and then--then this happens.

539
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:40,040
Well, that may be.

540
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,352
But I'm sure you'll agree,

541
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,905
we do need to call
some professionals

542
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:43,906
to determine
what really happened.

543
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:45,356
Oh, of course.

544
00:19:45,494 --> 00:19:47,220
I already called the constables
on the main island.

545
00:19:47,358 --> 00:19:49,464
And they said they're gonna
get here as soon as they can.

546
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:50,741
It's usually just
a couple of days

547
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:52,570
with the accidental drowning.

548
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,745
But we'll put poor Martha here

549
00:19:54,883 --> 00:19:57,437
in the walk-in fridge
until they arrive.

550
00:19:57,575 --> 00:19:59,094
Right.
Oh! I've got bars.

551
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:01,407
I've got a bar.
I'm gonna--would you?

552
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:03,271
There you go.

553
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:09,104
Why is Nolan FaceTiming me
from his honeymoon?

554
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,417
Are you calling
to rub in how beautiful

555
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:13,453
your island paradise is?

556
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:14,523
<i>I wish.</i>

557
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:15,766
<i>Place is run down,</i>

558
00:20:15,904 --> 00:20:17,285
<i>phone and internet
are very spotty,</i>

559
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:18,631
<i>there was a creeper
outside our window</i>

560
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:19,770
<i>watching us sleep for an hour,</i>

561
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:21,289
<i>and now we found a body.</i>

562
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:22,290
A body?

563
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:23,705
<i>Yeah.</i>

564
00:20:23,843 --> 00:20:25,707
<i>The housekeeper just
washed up on the beach.</i>

565
00:20:25,845 --> 00:20:27,778
<i>Something is wrong here,</i>

566
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:31,506
<i>and local law enforcement
is non-existent.</i>

567
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,749
<i>I'm worried somebody
maybe found out I was a cop</i>

568
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:36,062
<i>and is targeting--could you--</i>

569
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,753
Nolan.

570
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:39,548
Seems like he needs
some backup.

571
00:20:39,686 --> 00:20:41,757
Are you suggesting
a trip to the tropics?

572
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:43,897
I wasn't, but now I am.

573
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:45,071
Hm.

574
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:49,144
Sergeant Grey,
we have a problem.

575
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:50,939
Uh, Nolan just called.

576
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:53,044
They found a dead body
on the beach.

577
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:55,599
Why do I feel like I should
be more surprised about that?

578
00:20:55,737 --> 00:20:58,084
Yeah, he and Bailey are
basically trouble magnets.

579
00:20:58,222 --> 00:20:59,741
- Hmm.
- He doesn't have his gun.

580
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:01,156
No backup.

581
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:02,364
And now he's in the middle
of an active crime scene.

582
00:21:02,502 --> 00:21:03,883
We want to go down there.

583
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:05,712
To an island where
you have no jurisdiction?

584
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:08,853
By the time you get the funds
approved to book the travel,

585
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,993
he'll be celebrating
his anniversary.

586
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:12,236
I can put it
on Wesley's card,

587
00:21:12,374 --> 00:21:13,858
which is also
technically my card.

588
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:15,515
He's always saying
we should take a vacation.

589
00:21:15,653 --> 00:21:17,897
And then the department
can reimburse us.

590
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:20,865
You know they won't
cover first class.

591
00:21:21,003 --> 00:21:22,764
But the trust fund does.

592
00:21:22,902 --> 00:21:24,559
OK, seriously,

593
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:26,837
do you think
Nolan needs saving,

594
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:28,287
or are you just trying
to get out the office?

595
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:31,531
Who says two things
can't coexist?

596
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:39,021
Hey! Hey!

597
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:42,093
Uh, Celina,
can we talk after shift?

598
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:43,854
It's not fine.

599
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:45,131
Come again?

600
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,789
I know I said
this morning that the--

601
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:49,169
that the kiss wasn't
a big deal.

602
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,379
But the truth is,
I still feel weird.

603
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:55,244
And I have to be OK with that.

604
00:21:55,383 --> 00:21:57,108
You need to be OK with that.

605
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:58,489
Yeah, of course.

606
00:22:00,353 --> 00:22:01,596
How?

607
00:22:03,183 --> 00:22:05,807
I--I don't know.

608
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:08,361
I want us to get back
to normal too.

609
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:10,743
But it's--it's going
to take some time, OK?

610
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:13,815
And it will be weird
until it isn't.

611
00:22:14,954 --> 00:22:16,196
Boot!

612
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,579
I'm about to hang
a bell around your neck,

613
00:22:19,717 --> 00:22:20,753
'cause I keep losing you.

614
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:22,237
You get that paperwork
all done?

615
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,411
Oh, yes, sir.

616
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:24,412
Is there anything else you need

617
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,516
before I end my shift?

618
00:22:25,654 --> 00:22:26,621
What do you think?

619
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,070
I--

620
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,313
You are all done.

621
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:31,108
Clock out. Good work today.

622
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:32,351
Thank you.
Good night.

623
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:34,629
Good night.

624
00:22:36,562 --> 00:22:39,081
Would it kill you to give her
some acknowledgment?

625
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm trying to help her
become a good cop,

626
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:41,981
not boost her self-esteem.

627
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,776
Yeah, but when
you're teaching someone,

628
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:45,433
it's important to tell them
what they're doing right

629
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:47,504
as well as what
they can improve upon.

630
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:49,195
Yeah, it sounds
like a good plan

631
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:50,714
if you're going for mediocre.

632
00:22:50,852 --> 00:22:52,716
Have I not
softened you at all?

633
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:54,925
Is it weird that I'm nervous?

634
00:22:55,063 --> 00:22:56,202
No, it's not weird.

635
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,273
This is creepy.

636
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:02,450
Huh.

637
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:05,763
Oh.

638
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:09,215
Does that sound like mating
or killing to you?

639
00:23:10,803 --> 00:23:12,183
Power is out.

640
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:16,740
Fortunately, walk-in fridge
runs on a backup generator.

641
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:17,741
Are you ready?

642
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:18,949
Part of me is

643
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:21,123
and a part of me
just feels sad.

644
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:22,884
I hate seeing someone
kept like this.

645
00:23:23,022 --> 00:23:24,333
Same here.

646
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:25,645
Best thing we can do for her
is trying to figure out

647
00:23:25,783 --> 00:23:26,750
what really happened.

648
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:27,958
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

649
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:29,753
Some cameras here.

650
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,964
All right.
I am John Nolan, LAPD.

651
00:23:34,102 --> 00:23:35,483
This is Bailey Nune, EMT.

652
00:23:35,621 --> 00:23:40,626
We're doing an external autopsy
on Martha Delgado.

653
00:23:40,764 --> 00:23:42,386
We found her
in the water yesterday.

654
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:44,940
Time of death was estimated
eight hours prior.

655
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:46,735
She's been in cold storage
for six hours,

656
00:23:46,873 --> 00:23:49,428
giving us approximately
14 hours postmortem.

657
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:50,946
Her fingers look good.

658
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:52,638
Usually with some
sort of poisoning,

659
00:23:52,776 --> 00:23:55,434
there's a color change
or white lines on the nails.

660
00:23:55,572 --> 00:23:57,263
Not seeing any bruising.

661
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,713
Oh.

662
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:00,128
Hang on a sec.

663
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:04,097
Got a--it's a laceration
behind her left ear.

664
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:06,824
Did she hit her head
when she fell in the water

665
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:09,344
or was she hit
and then fell in?

666
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,691
No way to tell
without a proper autopsy.

667
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:13,003
Let's go through her pockets,

668
00:24:13,141 --> 00:24:14,004
see if there's
anything in there

669
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:15,281
that might fill in the blanks.

670
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:16,524
Oh.

671
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:17,766
John.

672
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,459
What is that?

673
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:21,598
A bandage claw.

674
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:22,771
Maybe she picked it up

675
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:24,221
when cleaning Dean's room.

676
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,913
And then took it for a swim
with all her clothes on?

677
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,122
Do you think he killed her?

678
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,710
I don't know.

679
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:32,954
But I am starting to think
we need to check out his cabin.

680
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:37,372
- Where's your hand?

681
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,201
I'm right here.
It's so dark.

682
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:42,066
The lights are off.

683
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:43,205
Yeah,
and the power's out too.

684
00:24:43,343 --> 00:24:44,344
So that's no help.

685
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,036
You think he's in there?

686
00:24:47,451 --> 00:24:49,798
Only one way to find out.

687
00:24:49,936 --> 00:24:51,766
OK.

688
00:24:57,219 --> 00:24:58,704
Empty. Let's go.

689
00:24:58,842 --> 00:24:59,981
OK.

690
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:04,537
OK.

691
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:06,401
This guy travels light.

692
00:25:12,856 --> 00:25:14,271
There.
- OK.

693
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:15,514
Great.

694
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:18,620
Oh, wait.

695
00:25:18,758 --> 00:25:20,380
I found something. Here.

696
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:24,523
What is this?

697
00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:27,422
Oh.

698
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,355
That is not your average
hunting equipment.

699
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:32,254
OK, um...

700
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:33,601
there's no serial number.

701
00:25:33,739 --> 00:25:35,534
- Let's take the ammo.
- What if he misses it?

702
00:25:35,672 --> 00:25:37,743
Well, better than
him using it.

703
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:39,538
Wait, wait.

704
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:50,756
I'm jamming the barrel.

705
00:25:50,894 --> 00:25:51,929
Here. That'll do it.

706
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,413
- Let's go.

707
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,449
It's him.

708
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:55,761
Back door.

709
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:00,420
Go, go, go.

710
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,837
What are you doing?
- The camera.

711
00:26:02,975 --> 00:26:04,079
Come on!

712
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:05,564
Let's go, let's go!

713
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:13,537
That was close.

714
00:26:17,748 --> 00:26:19,163
OK.

715
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:20,682
He's still there.

716
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,132
Maybe he's
calling it a night?

717
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,099
Or coming to try
to murder us.

718
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:26,101
The nearest island is
at least three hours away.

719
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:28,103
We could grab a kayak
and be there by sunrise.

720
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:29,449
So we notify police.

721
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,658
They head over here,

722
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:32,625
arrest Dean before
he finishes breakfast.

723
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:35,352
What do you say?
Kayaking by moonlight?

724
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,147
- I'll race you there.
- Yeah.

725
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:39,390
So there's an issue
with our escape plan.

726
00:26:39,528 --> 00:26:42,428
I mean, this took work!

727
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:44,775
Must have done that while
we were examining the body.

728
00:26:44,913 --> 00:26:47,467
He knows we're onto him.

729
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:51,886
This has certainly been
a memorable honeymoon.

730
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,233
There's no one else I'd rather
spend it with than you.

731
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:55,890
Oh, sweetie.

732
00:26:58,237 --> 00:26:59,790
I mean, except
you may be better off

733
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:02,310
with Harper or Lopez.

734
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:04,312
Or Tim or Lucy.

735
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,486
Right. Grey, Celina.

736
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,626
Aaron.

737
00:27:07,764 --> 00:27:09,144
Heck,
I'd even accept Smitty

738
00:27:09,282 --> 00:27:11,146
right now
if he brought his gun.

739
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,568
That's Elise.
She looks bad.

740
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:20,880
I'm gonna go.
- No, wait, wait, wait, wait.

741
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:21,985
It's OK.
It's OK.

742
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:23,434
I will be right back.
- John, no!

743
00:27:23,572 --> 00:27:24,884
- I'll be right back.
- No.

744
00:27:25,022 --> 00:27:26,679
Oh, my God.

745
00:27:35,032 --> 00:27:36,689
Hey!

746
00:27:37,828 --> 00:27:39,071
- No--

747
00:27:45,111 --> 00:27:46,354
John!

748
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:12,311
What time is it?

749
00:28:14,865 --> 00:28:16,833
Oh, my God, it's so late.

750
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:17,937
You needed to sleep.

751
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:19,767
No, I should be studying.

752
00:28:19,905 --> 00:28:21,251
Ah, take the morning off.

753
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:22,631
Don't you feel better?

754
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:25,911
You know, I do.

755
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:27,222
Thank you.

756
00:28:32,158 --> 00:28:33,781
Oh, my God.

757
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,575
My test is in 20 minutes!

758
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:36,749
What? How?

759
00:28:36,887 --> 00:28:38,544
They moved it up!

760
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,547
No service. You?

761
00:28:42,997 --> 00:28:44,101
Nope.

762
00:28:44,239 --> 00:28:45,585
Which means
we can't track their phones

763
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,864
or get an ETA on our backup.

764
00:28:48,002 --> 00:28:49,279
I don't like this.

765
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,315
Yeah, there is no one
around to greet you.

766
00:28:51,453 --> 00:28:53,386
Or hear you scream.

767
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,564
That--that was just
an animal, right?

768
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:00,359
Sure. But just in case.

769
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,266
OK.

770
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:14,442
Um, hi, I'm Lucy Chen,

771
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,271
and I'm here for
the detective's exam.

772
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:17,583
- Chen.
- Mm-hmm.

773
00:29:17,721 --> 00:29:18,964
Right.

774
00:29:19,102 --> 00:29:21,138
Take a seat.

775
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:23,796
They'll be with you
in a few hours.

776
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:26,523
Um--no, um, but I got
a text from them.

777
00:29:26,661 --> 00:29:28,490
They said that
they needed me right away.

778
00:29:28,628 --> 00:29:30,216
What can I tell you?

779
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:31,528
Over there.

780
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,495
They'll get to you
when they get to you.

781
00:29:33,633 --> 00:29:35,083
Hey. How's she doing?

782
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:36,291
Celina or Lucy?

783
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:37,361
Both.

784
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:38,811
Celina is making progress.

785
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:40,226
I think she's riding
with me again today.

786
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:43,195
Lucy's in the test now
waiting her turn.

787
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,679
I'll be glad when this is done.

788
00:29:44,817 --> 00:29:46,439
Hey, I did some research
on the security badge

789
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:47,786
our John Doe was wearing.

790
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:50,167
The company patrols
dozens of businesses in LA.

791
00:29:50,305 --> 00:29:53,032
He kept talking about
North Korea, right?

792
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,654
Well, one
of the office buildings

793
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,725
is in Koreatown,
just a few blocks

794
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,830
from where we found him.

795
00:29:57,968 --> 00:29:59,383
Why the fake badge?

796
00:29:59,521 --> 00:30:02,455
The company has a diamond
exchange on the fourth floor.

797
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:03,802
And you think
he was gonna rob it?

798
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,389
Exactly.
I think something went wrong.

799
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:07,288
He got injured
and lost his memory.

800
00:30:08,358 --> 00:30:09,738
Not any better ideas.

801
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:11,223
Let's go check it out.

802
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:13,639
Great work.

803
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:15,227
Let's go, Boot.

804
00:30:19,231 --> 00:30:20,819
Clear.

805
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:31,243
They put up cameras
all over the place.

806
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:32,727
All right.

807
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,246
The last footage has to be
uploaded somewhere.

808
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:36,696
Let's get this charged,
see what we can find.

809
00:30:43,565 --> 00:30:46,672
All right, so which wall is
the diamond exchange behind?

810
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,088
That one.

811
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:50,538
OK.

812
00:30:50,676 --> 00:30:52,091
So it looks like
he tried to break

813
00:30:52,229 --> 00:30:54,714
into the diamond exchange
through a shared wall,

814
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,270
fell through the ceiling,
knocked himself out instead.

815
00:30:58,408 --> 00:31:00,272
- Is someone there?

816
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,480
Hello?

817
00:31:01,618 --> 00:31:04,345
Hey, man, get me out of here!

818
00:31:04,483 --> 00:31:06,209
Police. Someone in there?

819
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:07,866
Help me. I'm stuck!

820
00:31:26,643 --> 00:31:29,473
Thank God you found me.

821
00:31:29,611 --> 00:31:31,268
I knew Roger wouldn't
leave me behind.

822
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:32,580
I knew it.

823
00:31:32,718 --> 00:31:35,272
I just wish you got here
five minutes earlier...

824
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,205
before I drank my own urine.

825
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:50,805
Officer Chen.

826
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,097
Good evening.

827
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:08,098
Thank you for--

828
00:32:08,236 --> 00:32:09,824
It's been a long day,

829
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,239
so let's just get right to it.

830
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,553
What would you do
if a member of the press

831
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:16,796
wanted access to a crime scene?

832
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,868
The press are allowed
closer access to a crime scene

833
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:21,422
than the general public.

834
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,424
It is acceptable for the press
to enter a crime scene

835
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:26,945
if and only if they are not
going to disturb the evidence

836
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,394
or endanger themselves.

837
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,845
Let's talk about
the importance

838
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,536
of not disturbing evidence.

839
00:32:32,674 --> 00:32:36,851
Recently, you--you failed
to secure a crime scene.

840
00:32:39,405 --> 00:32:41,856
- I did.
- And?

841
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:44,583
The sprinklers went off.

842
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:47,724
Critical evidence was
literally washed away.

843
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:49,726
I recovered what I could,
and I worked with the DA

844
00:32:49,864 --> 00:32:51,762
to make the case
as strong as possible.

845
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,488
It was my fault.

846
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:55,352
I accept
full responsibility for that.

847
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,492
But I made the most of it.

848
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,909
It sounds like you're
almost glad you lost evidence.

849
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:02,981
Of course not.

850
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,430
But I couldn't change it.

851
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:07,157
And I didn't let it
knock me off my course.

852
00:33:07,295 --> 00:33:10,126
I tracked my suspect,
and I got a full confession.

853
00:33:12,335 --> 00:33:14,026
I learned a lot
from that mistake,

854
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:16,822
and I will never make it again.

855
00:33:34,081 --> 00:33:37,187
Looks like there's
a few cabins in the east.

856
00:33:37,325 --> 00:33:39,534
All right. Here we go.

857
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:50,166
Look what you did.

858
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:55,067
Yeah.

859
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:57,000
All right.
We gotta find them now.

860
00:33:57,138 --> 00:33:58,519
Which way is east?

861
00:33:58,657 --> 00:34:00,038
Uh, that way.

862
00:34:00,176 --> 00:34:01,901
Let's go.

863
00:34:04,076 --> 00:34:06,251
I came here for peace
and quiet...

864
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:11,221
To heal.

865
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,129
And you screwed that up.

866
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:34,072
I was finally gonna be
good-looking.

867
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:39,077
And hot girls like you...

868
00:34:39,215 --> 00:34:41,424
were finally gonna look my way.

869
00:34:41,562 --> 00:34:43,909
And now they'll--
now they'll just run.

870
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:46,981
True beauty is on the inside.

871
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,294
Oh. [laughs] Good.

872
00:34:49,432 --> 00:34:52,262
Then you won't mind me cutting
my way inside you to find it?

873
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,539
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

874
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:54,851
Look, focus on me.

875
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,128
I'm the one who screwed
everything up for you.

876
00:34:56,266 --> 00:34:57,509
It was me.
- Don't be jealous.

877
00:34:57,647 --> 00:35:00,201
There's plenty of this
to go around, huh?

878
00:35:03,411 --> 00:35:04,895
You're a cop, aren't you?

879
00:35:05,033 --> 00:35:06,173
Yes.

880
00:35:06,311 --> 00:35:07,657
Yes, I am, LAPD.

881
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:10,246
But us being here has
nothing to do with you.

882
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:11,557
We're on our honeymoon.

883
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:12,662
Right!

884
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,284
It's a whole operation.

885
00:35:14,422 --> 00:35:17,598
"It's a"--
Rafael and Elise work here.

886
00:35:17,736 --> 00:35:19,979
What, you--you thought
they were undercover?

887
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,981
- What do you know about me?
- Nothing.

888
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,466
And we wouldn't have
suspected anything

889
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:24,984
if you'd just left us alone!

890
00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:39,137
You are a liar!

891
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:41,829
- Shut up!

892
00:35:41,967 --> 00:35:45,212
Or you're gonna end up
as dead as your dad!

893
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:49,492
By the way, you were smart
to take my ammo,

894
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,976
but you didn't hide it
very well.

895
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:51,977
No!

896
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:55,705
Gun.

897
00:36:22,352 --> 00:36:23,940
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

898
00:36:24,078 --> 00:36:25,079
I was so scared.

899
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:26,356
Get some towels
from the bathroom.

900
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:27,426
I need to stop her bleeding.
- Right.

901
00:36:27,564 --> 00:36:29,704
- I got it.
- Yeah, yeah.

902
00:36:31,844 --> 00:36:33,777
It's gonna be OK.

903
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:36,608
What is--oh, my God.

904
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:37,919
I believe that's yours.

905
00:36:40,336 --> 00:36:41,578
Who the hell is that?

906
00:36:41,716 --> 00:36:43,891
That's our backup, finally.

907
00:36:45,858 --> 00:36:47,826
Looks like our honeymoon
ends with an airlift.

908
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:49,345
Thank God.

909
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:54,315
You did good work
today, Boot.

910
00:36:54,453 --> 00:36:56,386
Paid attention to details,
thought outside the box.

911
00:36:56,524 --> 00:36:57,801
Thank you.

912
00:36:57,939 --> 00:36:59,769
I couldn't have done it
without my training officer.

913
00:36:59,907 --> 00:37:01,080
That's a good answer.

914
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,427
But day's not done yet.

915
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:04,463
Right, right.

916
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:06,500
But you know, this could be
a little more manageable

917
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:08,571
with the help from my TO.

918
00:37:08,709 --> 00:37:10,400
Don't mistake my compliment
for kindness.

919
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:12,230
Police work isn't
supposed to be manageable.

920
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:14,404
Good luck.
- Yes, sir.

921
00:37:15,681 --> 00:37:16,613
Ooh.

922
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:18,063
- Hey.
- Hey.

923
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:19,823
I heard a guy vomited on you,

924
00:37:19,961 --> 00:37:22,274
and then you booked another guy
who drank his own urine?

925
00:37:22,412 --> 00:37:23,758
Yeah.

926
00:37:23,896 --> 00:37:26,174
You know, I bet you're missing
patrol right about now.

927
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:27,935
I think I can handle
a few more days

928
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:31,628
without being covered
in a stranger's bodily fluids.

929
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:37,116
Today feels less weird
than yesterday, doesn't it?

930
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,428
Yeah.

931
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:40,810
And maybe tomorrow
will feel even less weird.

932
00:37:40,948 --> 00:37:42,260
That sounds about right.

933
00:37:42,398 --> 00:37:44,469
Good, 'cause I--

934
00:37:44,607 --> 00:37:46,643
I miss my friend.

935
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:48,369
Me too.

936
00:37:48,507 --> 00:37:51,441
Maybe we can laugh
about this sometime soon--

937
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:54,168
not, like, today, but soon.

938
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:57,965
Good night, Celina.

939
00:37:58,103 --> 00:37:59,760
Good night.

940
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,799
Hmm.

941
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:23,784
Sarge, I'm gonna die
on this list.

942
00:38:26,131 --> 00:38:28,133
Sorry, Chen.

943
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:48,533
Well, well, well.

944
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:52,053
The shortest vacation ever.

945
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:54,918
You get an ID on Nolan
and Bailey's bad guy?

946
00:38:55,056 --> 00:38:57,921
Yep, his real name is
Nicholas Colston.

947
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:00,027
He has been in the wind
since they found

948
00:39:00,165 --> 00:39:03,513
pieces of his girlfriend
all over his apartment.

949
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:04,756
He was hiding out
on the island

950
00:39:04,894 --> 00:39:06,585
recovering from facial surgery,

951
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:08,449
and when he saw a cop
honeymooning next door,

952
00:39:08,587 --> 00:39:09,864
he got paranoid.

953
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:12,626
He thought his victims were
conducting surveillance.

954
00:39:12,764 --> 00:39:14,213
Glad you got there
when you did.

955
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,388
Well, local law says
that we might have to go

956
00:39:16,526 --> 00:39:19,011
back down to the island
to testify.

957
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:21,566
Yeah.
Week--maybe two, tops.

958
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:22,705
Mm.

959
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:27,537
Yeah.

960
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,541
That's funny.

961
00:39:36,581 --> 00:39:39,238
I can't believe
I came in 17th.

962
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,965
It's almost worse
than coming in last.

963
00:39:42,103 --> 00:39:43,588
Hey, look.

964
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:46,073
There is definitely no prize
for coming in last.

965
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:51,527
But I'm pretty sure there's
a prize for coming in 17th.

966
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:52,838
Oh, my God.

967
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:55,634
Oh.

968
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:57,602
I guess I'll just
have to set my sights

969
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:01,502
on a different future,
like metro.

970
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,057
I'm kidding.

971
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,404
I--I knew that.

972
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,267
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

973
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,063
You really thought
I was gonna come in first?

974
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:13,272
Of course I did.

00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,274
