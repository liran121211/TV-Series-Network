1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,606
Dispatch said it was a noise complaint?

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,696
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,906
And they requested us specifically?

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,116
That's what she said.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,430
I guess we missed it.

6
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,266
This would be a great opportunity

7
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,710
to teach me about de-escalating
in policing.

8
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:45,536
Imagine my surprise when reviewing

9
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,836
last week's bodycam footage and I saw

10
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,296
this.

11
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,336
No. Yes, sir.

12
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,126
I... well, I

13
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,990
I can explain. It's.

14
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,160
I'm waiting.

15
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,186
Wake up, lazybones.

16
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,446
We're gettin' married tomorrow,

17
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,566
and there is a butt load to get done.

18
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,156
I'm not feeling very good.

19
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,616
- What?
- Yeah, my head.

20
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,696
- What's going on?
- Maybe...

21
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,236
Sucker!

22
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,996
- You faker.
- Yeah.

23
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,786
Listen, this is important.

24
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,326
We're getting married tomorrow.

25
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,956
I know. I already said that.

26
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,996
Yeah, I just felt like it needed

27
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,690
a little extra attention.

28
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,586
- Get your ass out of bed.
- Yes, boss.

29
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,626
We need to go meet
the wedding planner.

30
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,700
Yes, boss.

31
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,830
Henry, hi.

32
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,316
Hey, Bailey.

33
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,526
<i>Are you getting on your flight?</i>

34
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,066
No. A little hiccup.

35
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,566
My flight got canceled.

36
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,486
Technically, the entire airline
went bankrupt, so...

37
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,946
Okay, well, we're just gonna have

38
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,076
to get you on another flight.

39
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,116
I tried, but there are none available

40
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,786
that'll get me there
in time for the wedding.

41
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,166
- Who are you talking to?
- The firehouse.

42
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,206
We are not gonna tell your dad about this

43
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,666
because I don't want him to worry.

44
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,086
<i>Okay, I need you to get
to the train station.</i>

45
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,086
It looks like there's
a few flights out of Haneda

46
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,386
that would get you here in time,

47
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,676
but you need to make
the next bullet train.

48
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,426
On it. Thanks for the assist.

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,346
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, totally.

50
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,716
They couldn't find something,

51
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,266
so instead of actually looking,
they call me.

52
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,186
- Men.
- Tell me about it.

53
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,490
- Shall we plan a wedding?
- Yes.

54
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,896
Chastity, hi!

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,396
Pete. Not Pete. Randy.

56
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,526
Hello, mein bestest Freund.

57
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,776
Wow. Funniest of stories.

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,276
So when I skip-tracer-bounty-hunted

59
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,156
Mr. Peter yesterday,
he begged me not to take him in

60
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,246
because of your upcoming
marital consummation.

61
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,366
Skip traced for what?

62
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,286
Outstanding warrant.

63
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,036
6,000 in unpaid parking tickets.

64
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,586
- 6,000?
- Yeah.

65
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,206
Yeah, when I told him I took a vow

66
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,876
as a law enforcement officer
not to accept bribes,

67
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,546
he made me promise to go
to your wedding in his place.

68
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,346
And have sexy time with his girlfriend?

69
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,136
Just over-the-clothes stuff.

70
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,926
I'm teaching Randy here
how to be a better kisser.

71
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,936
She is very good.
Allow me to share her skills.

72
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,556
- No. No.
- That's okay.

73
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,516
We're actually running late
to meet the wedding planners.

74
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,686
Well, this is insane, to be honest.

75
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,726
But we've really gotta go.

76
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,856
So the guest room is ready to go.

77
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,606
Please stay out of trouble.

78
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,736
You are no fun, but you will be tonight

79
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,946
at your bachelor party.

80
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,026
No bachelor party.

81
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,366
I told you... I told Pete.

82
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,286
Yeah, and he said, "Well, I can't believe"

83
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,746
"we are related, half-bro.

84
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,416
- "Pound."
- Nailed it.

85
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,536
But while I am so glad that you are here,

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,166
I, in no way, agree to participate

87
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,916
in this bizarre brother-swap thing,

88
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,586
- so you can cut that out...
- Okay.

89
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,926
You can have a lovely day,
and you can come with me.

90
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,926
- Yes.
- Thank you, guys.

91
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,256
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

92
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,846
- Okay, we are alone.
- Yeah.

93
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,426
What would Mr. Peter do?

94
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,460
Um...

95
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,816
- Role-play.
- Yes.

96
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,646
I will be Marlene Dietrich.

97
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,616
You will be Marty McFly,

98
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,196
teaming up with Mr. Frodo
to help him get to Mordor.

99
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,116
- Thank you for breakfast.
- Of course.

100
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,156
But you didn't have to walk me home.

101
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,996
I didn't. I came to check on Aaron.

102
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,126
All right.

103
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,706
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

104
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,996
Remember, I have book group,
so I'll be home late.

105
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,506
You just had book group.

106
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,876
How many books
do you guys read a week?

107
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,426
Two or three.

108
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,386
Now where can I find Aaron?

109
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,806
Thank you. Bye, baby.

110
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,830
- Bye, baby.
- Mwah.

111
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,960
And turn to the right.

112
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,976
Wish we had a better lighting setup,

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,986
but this tells a story.

114
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,986
Hi.

115
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,316
Mrs. Grey, hey.

116
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,736
How you feeling?

117
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,366
Good. Great.

118
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,696
Wish I could just get back out there.

119
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,326
I understand.

120
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,326
But don't rush.

121
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,916
No matter what Wade might say,

122
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,166
it took him a while to get himself right

123
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,916
after he was shot.

124
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,456
No one's gonna judge you negatively.

125
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,940
Appreciate that. Thanks.

126
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,886
Well, I'm gonna get going.

127
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,500
Of course. Thanks for checking in. Yeah.

128
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,766
- Hey.
- Hey.

129
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,186
- You have a sec?
- Sure.

130
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,236
No. Sorry, we gotta get out there.

131
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,316
Everything all right?

132
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,526
Yeah. Totally. It can wait.

133
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,366
Get your ass in the shop.

134
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:36,076
You are driving while
I figure out your new nickname.

135
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,416
Yes, ma'am.

136
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,416
- Got a minute to talk?
- Sure.

137
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,206
There's nothing to talk about.

138
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,666
You felt I undermined you
at a crime scene

139
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,876
to stop you from making detective.

140
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,216
I explained that I didn't.

141
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,926
- Now we're moving on.
- Okay.

142
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,676
Well, while I appreciate the efficiency,

143
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,386
that's not how actual
healthy communication works.

144
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,096
Wow, that's not condescending at all.

145
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,516
Explain to me what there is to talk about

146
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,686
that isn't just a retread

147
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,016
of what I just efficiently covered?

148
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,976
Well... that's not the point.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,476
Look, if I have to start

150
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,236
another deep undercover assignment,

151
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,106
there are real issues here
that we need to talk about.

152
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,366
Which we will deal with
if they come up then.

153
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,026
I gotta get to work.

154
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,260
Have a good shift.

155
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,286
<i>This is a problem.</i>

156
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,996
It's amazing you got it last-minute,

157
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,666
but it's so much more
than a home wedding.

158
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:27,376
- And by more, you mean...
- Expensive.

159
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,336
If we bring the same game plan
here as your house,

160
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,216
it'll look cheap and low-rent.

161
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,546
So we have to up everything...
flowers, catering.

162
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,806
I'm a little worried about
how stressed out you seem.

163
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,556
Sorry, it's been a morning.

164
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,516
My girlfriend is cheating,
and my assistant quit.

165
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,096
- Well, we're happy to help.
- Great.

166
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,016
I need you to go give Be-Bop $1,000.

167
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,516
- Love it. Who's Be-Bop?
- Our DJ.

168
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,186
I am so sorry,
I just have to take this quick.

169
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,686
Hey, what's up?

170
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,776
- Where are you?
- I'm doing wedding stuff.

171
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,026
You forgot about the deposition.

172
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,616
I forgot about the deposition.

173
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,156
You have to get me out of that.
There's so much to do.

174
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,286
I'm getting married tomorrow.

175
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,696
Look, I get it, but Judge Scott was born

176
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,406
without sympathy.

177
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,996
Wesley.

178
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,576
Looking sharp.

179
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,496
- Sharp.
- Ha.

180
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,756
I can try to get Oscar's lawyer
to agree to a continuance,

181
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,126
but only when you're here.

182
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,796
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

183
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,176
Be where in 20?

184
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,846
It's a surprise, but I will meet you

185
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,870
at the DJ's house.

186
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:21,136
- Okay, no problem.
- Gotcha.

187
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,896
Henry. Hey, what's happenin'?

188
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,436
You missed the bullet train.

189
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,646
Those things go quick.

190
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,526
Okay, just give me a second
to figure out a plan C.

191
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,736
You have always hated him.

192
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
He won't stop barking.

193
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,326
You take point, Miss Cleo.

194
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,736
Mi... right, the psychic. Good one.

195
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,286
Who called 911?

196
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,036
That was me, because
this bitch poisoned my dog.

197
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,286
I did not.

198
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,036
Can I take a look at him?

199
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,086
Yeah, of course. He's a sweetheart.

200
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,296
He's a menace.

201
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,626
But I didn't hurt him, I swear.

202
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:56,030
It's okay.

203
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,176
It looks like he was chewing
on your planter.

204
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,750
Detective, can you look at this?

205
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
Thank you.

206
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,526
Um, where did you get this flowerpot?

207
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,526
The farmers market last weekend.

208
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,696
Why?

209
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,446
Okay, we need to have it tested.

210
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,116
Officer Juarez will give you a receipt.

211
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,656
You need to take your dog to the vet

212
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,946
and let them know that he might
have ingested a narcotic.

213
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,456
- Wesley.
- John-O.

214
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,956
It's great to see you.

215
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,126
I'm sorry for upsetting

216
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,916
and disrupting your upcoming nuptials.

217
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,416
Although truth be told, I'm a little hurt

218
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,756
I didn't get the invite.

219
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,706
Is that why you're suing me?

220
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,086
No.

221
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,796
I'm suing you for gross negligence

222
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,176
in allowing my injury while
selflessly donating a kidney.

223
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,716
Oscar, you are so full of...

224
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,516
Don't talk to my client like that.

225
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,516
Monica.

226
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,266
Good morning.

227
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:49,476
I'm taking over Mr. Hutchinson's case.

228
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,186
Substitution of counsel
has been filed with the court.

229
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,566
Let's get started.

230
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,946
You're in trouble now.

231
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,106
Aaron. Look, I'm sorry about earlier.

232
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,316
You know how judgy Harper can be,

233
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,526
and I really need to impress her.

234
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,786
- You okay?
- Yeah.

235
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,656
Just, um, having a hard day.

236
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,576
It's okay.

237
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,036
You're safe.

238
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,376
Boot, I thought you were going to 10-1.

239
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,666
No, yes, ma'am. I'll be out there in five.

240
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,756
Make it two.

241
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,506
So how's it going
with the department shrink?

242
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,546
Good.

243
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,910
Should be cleared any day now.

244
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,186
Officer Lucy Chen, wow.
How fortunate to find you here.

245
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,736
Fortunate for who?

246
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,526
We have ein winzig problem
and need a little help.

247
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,736
Randy pawned Bailey's wedding ring.

248
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,826
What? Why would you do that?

249
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,536
I was role-playing as Pete
and got a little carried away.

250
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,616
And unfortunately,
before I could buy it back,

251
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,536
a murderous-looking man
bought it out from under me.

252
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,576
So we really need you to, um...

253
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,956
- Get it back?
- Exactly. Wow!

254
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,126
See, I told you we have come
to the right location.

255
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,546
Please help us.

256
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,860
Immediately.

257
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,556
Hey.

258
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,136
Do you have any leverage
with a felon called The Hammer?

259
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,346
No, why?

260
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,346
Okay, so Skip Tracer Randy
was role-playing

261
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,596
as Nolan's brother Pete,

262
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,726
and he pawned Bailey's wedding ring,

263
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,526
and The Hammer bought it.

264
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,526
Nothing about that sentence
makes sense.

265
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,106
I've run The Hammer before.

266
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,986
You want no part of his craziness.

267
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,406
Yet I still told Randy

268
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:24,776
that I would try and get it for him, so

269
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,286
I'll go with you.

270
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,656
No. Please don't do me any favors.

271
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,116
Seriously?

272
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,496
I knew you weren't gonna
be able to let it go.

273
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,956
I have completely let it go.

274
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,286
Let what go?

275
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,296
Nothing.

276
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,006
Okay, do you want my help or not?

277
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,796
I don't need it, but I will accept it.

278
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,006
- Fine.
- Good.

279
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,176
- Whatever.
- Great.

280
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,466
- Let's go.
- Maybe I'll go too.

281
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,466
Grab some popcorn on the way
for the show.

282
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,346
- You're not funny.
- I'm hysterical.

283
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,806
Ask Wesley.

284
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,636
Failure to protect my client is a violation

285
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,556
of the Eighth Amendment,
not to mention depriving him

286
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,396
of minimal civilized measures
of life's necessities.

287
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,776
- He got takeout.
- I got assaulted.

288
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,856
And you let it happen.

289
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,606
Look, I don't have time for this.

290
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,316
How about a little bit
of human decency here, Monica?

291
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,196
Officer Nolan has a wedding
to get ready for.

292
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,486
If you agree to the continuance,

293
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,486
the judge will sign off.

294
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,696
Happy to.

295
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,746
If Officer Nolan turns over his phone.

296
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,746
- What?
- No, no, no.

297
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,746
That is ridiculous.

298
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:14,246
His phone contains evidence

299
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,456
in texts, photos, and notes consistent

300
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,296
with a cruel indifference
to my client's suffering.

301
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,716
No, it doesn't.

302
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,836
And I worry that he will
destroy that evidence

303
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,096
if given the opportunity.

304
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,216
Okay, there is no nexus between

305
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,506
the plaintiff's alleged discomfort

306
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,676
and Officer Nolan's phone.

307
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,426
And any such intrusion is so vast

308
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,056
that only a special master
should be allowed

309
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,436
to review the contents of that phone.

310
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,856
Then it looks like
we're spending the day here.

311
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,356
No, I-I can't.

312
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,476
Just... look, I'm gonna
give Wesley my phone.

313
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,646
The judge can decide what to share.

314
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,106
Great seeing you, John.

315
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,390
Congratulations.

316
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,616
I just need to write down one address.

317
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,736
<i>Why didn't you answer my call?</i>

318
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,866
- Lost my phone.
- What? Where?

319
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,786
At the surprise place.

320
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,746
John, the next 24 hours are gonna hit us

321
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,086
at 100 miles an hour.

322
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,246
I need you to have a phone.

323
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,706
No. Yeah. I know. Don't worry.

324
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,206
I'm gonna get one right after
we're finished here.

325
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,336
I won't skip a beat.

326
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,610
Okay.

327
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,046
- Who is it?
- John Nolan.

328
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,926
You're gonna DJ our wedding tomorrow.

329
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,990
Yeah, yeah. It's open. Come on in.

330
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,726
Hey, what's up?

331
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,436
Listen, I've been thinking
a lot about your gig

332
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,606
because I know
that you said you wanted me

333
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,146
to lean into, like,
a '90s Janet vibe or whatever.

334
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,526
But I just got this old Nordic go-go disk.

335
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,656
You gotta check this out
because I really think

336
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,776
this is gonna set...

337
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,906
You know switchblades are illegal

338
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,236
in the state of California, right?

339
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,326
- Really?
- Yeah.

340
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,076
It's a violation of Penal Code 21510,

341
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,916
but I can ignore that.

342
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,326
We're just here to give you
the cash for the gig.

343
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,586
Hey, what's up? No. No, no, no.

344
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,086
You tell him that he's gotta pay up.

345
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,586
I boosted those kicks
'cause he said he wanted them.

346
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,426
Do I look like I have size 7 feet to you?

347
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,836
Now he's bragging about shoplifting.

348
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,046
Why don't you just wait outside?

349
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,426
- I think that's for the best.
- Yeah.

350
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,846
I'm sorry, you guys said
that you were here

351
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:54,176
for the... the DJ gig or some molly?

352
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,346
Okay. And that's a felony.

353
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,726
We were here for the DJ gig,
but seeing as how I'm a cop

354
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,516
and you just committed
several crimes in front of me,

355
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,776
now I'm here to arrest you.

356
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,276
All right, good news, bad news.

357
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,236
The Hammer,
aka William Robert Bennett,

358
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,656
has an outstanding felony warrant.

359
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,826
Wait, his name is Billy Bob Bennett?

360
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,156
Correct.

361
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,866
No wonder he prefers his nickname.

362
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,326
Can I finish the whole
good news/bad news cliché?

363
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,366
Yes. Sorry, knock yourself out.

364
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,836
The Hammer has a felony warrant,

365
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,746
which means we can go
kick down his door right now.

366
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,006
Which is good,
but he bought the ring legally.

367
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,296
Which is bad, because
he's under no obligation

368
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,636
to give it to us, and I'd argue
he's even less inclined

369
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,046
to hand it over once we arrest him.

370
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,966
Plus...

371
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,226
Plus what?

372
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,896
Plus, The Hammer
is called The Hammer

373
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,936
because he likes to fight.

374
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,210
And there's no one he loves
to fight more than cops.

375
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,946
Well, after you.

376
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,550
No, ladies first.

377
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,466
Oh. Um, just wait. Hear us out.

378
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,296
Earlier today, you bought
a wedding ring at a pawn shop.

379
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,546
Yeah. I'm getting married in a month.

380
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,176
Congratulations.

381
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,716
Unfortunately, that ring was stolen,

382
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,136
and we... we will need it back.

383
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,306
Well, I paid 1,000 bucks for it.

384
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,106
Right, which is why we are willing

385
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,686
to make a trade with you today.

386
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,106
You give us the ring

387
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,276
and we will give you a head start.

388
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,406
She's lying.

389
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,116
She's not.

390
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,366
You give it to us, we head
back down to the shop,

391
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,906
we'll wait 20 minutes
before we call for backup.

392
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,286
You can make a run for it,

393
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,866
grab the missus-to-be, head to ground.

394
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:43,270
Right.

395
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,876
Nah.

396
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,456
Why not?

397
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,626
Because eventually,
I'm gonna get caught.

398
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,636
But you needing something from me,

399
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,006
now, that's an opportunity.

400
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,176
What kind of opportunity?

401
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,556
A fair fight for once.

402
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,556
You beat me, I'll give you the ring

403
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,516
and I put your cuffs on.

404
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,686
I beat you,

405
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,436
I get to keep the ring
and I still put the cuffs on.

406
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:09,050
No fight, no ring.

407
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,276
Guess you're gonna have to fight him.

408
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,156
I have to look amazing
in a dress tomorrow.

409
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,786
Nobody cares what you look like.

410
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,600
He's huge. I am not fighting him.

411
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,626
Let's go.

412
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,020
Yes!

413
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,570
- You got this.
- Thanks.

414
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,080
My God.

415
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,666
All right! You win.

416
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,206
You win. You win.

417
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,270
The ring's in the drawer over there.

418
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,476
That's good.

419
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,460
Here.

420
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,646
Good job.

421
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,646
Yeah, thanks.

422
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,656
Yeah.

423
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,986
Are you okay?

424
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,510
Yeah, I'm great.

425
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,786
Got your text. What's up?

426
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,576
A tox screen came back
on that hinky flowerpot.

427
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,746
Pure heroin.

428
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,996
That the skell that our homeowner

429
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,956
bought the flowerpot from?

430
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,756
Yep, Seth Gallegos.

431
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,966
Couple misdemeanor priors.

432
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,376
You want help taking a run at him?

433
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,756
No, I'm gonna get the rookie to do it.

434
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,926
Yeah, see what she's got.

435
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,806
And you invited me to watch the show.

436
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,160
Gracias.

437
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,106
Mr. Gallegos, thank you for coming in.

438
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,266
Didn't think I had a choice.

439
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,026
No, you absolutely do.

440
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,526
I just was hoping you can
clear up a few things.

441
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,316
Let's start easy.

442
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,986
Do you sell these at
the Silverlake Farmers Market?

443
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,616
I don't know.

444
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,616
No, I don't.

445
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,286
Seth.

446
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,166
I think you know you're in trouble here.

447
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,626
We tested the flowerpots.

448
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,046
It's made of compressed heroin.

449
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,046
I don't know what that is.

450
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,166
You don't know what heroin is?

451
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,426
All right, let's just cut to the chase.

452
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,256
You're a low-level drug mule,

453
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,046
most likely working for the crew

454
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,056
that converts the flowerpots
into street product.

455
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,676
You figured nobody would miss
the real flowerpots

456
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,226
that are packed in the front of the truck

457
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,096
to hide the fake ones,
so you started selling them.

458
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,566
But you sold the wrong planters.

459
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,276
How am I doing?

460
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,396
You do know that El Jefe
is going to be homicidal

461
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,406
when he finds out you stole from him.

462
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,946
I didn't steal.

463
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,946
I don't steal. I'm not a thief.

464
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,156
And I don't know
what you're talking about.

465
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,696
A drug mule? What?

466
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,286
Listen, you have more power
than you realize.

467
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:54,036
Start talking
and you can name your terms,

468
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,586
get immunity, protection.

469
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,376
Otherwise, I'm afraid
the next time I see you,

470
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,506
you'll be in a body bag.

471
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,836
- She has him.
- You putting money on that?

472
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,796
Hell no. I didn't say she could land him.

473
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:08,846
You said I was free to go,
so I'm gonna go.

474
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,476
Okay, wait.

475
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,976
This offer's got a clock on it,
like your life.

476
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,170
Here's my card. Call me anytime.

477
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,896
So much room for improvement,
Miss Cleo.

478
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,406
Yeah, I know.

479
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,446
I didn't have anything to hold him on.

480
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,486
To be fair, you got him to the finish line.

481
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:26,656
Yeah, but I didn't get him across.

482
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,036
So what now?

483
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,156
Write it up and hand it off to Narcotics.

484
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,230
This one goes in your loss column.

485
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,876
<i>Where have you been?</i>

486
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,706
Buying a new phone.
Why? What's wrong?

487
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,046
The florist tried
calling you, like, ten times.

488
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,466
He thought we'd ghosted him.

489
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,426
He had another order
and he sold our flowers.

490
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,296
What? Why wouldn't he call you?

491
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,216
I might have been on another call.

492
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,306
Okay, let's just focus on solutions.

493
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,886
Well, there are none. It's end of day.

494
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,766
There is no florist
that could handle an order

495
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,766
this large last-minute.

496
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,436
But we need to have flowers
for the wedding.

497
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,976
We will, and I know
exactly where to get them.

498
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,146
Don't worry about this.

499
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:02,356
You just go and enjoy girls' night.

500
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,180
<i>- I got this.
- Okay. Thank you.</i>

501
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,406
Where's my ring?

502
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,036
Hey, what's up?

503
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,536
My wedding ring is missing.

504
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,126
No, it's not.

505
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:20,496
Randy got caramel on it,
so I got it cleaned for you.

506
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,836
- Here it is. Here it is.
- Thank you.

507
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,376
Knock, knock.

508
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,546
I have a cake
for the Nolan-Nune wedding.

509
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,426
I'm sorry, but there's been a mistake,

510
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,676
which is clearly
our official wedding motto.

511
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,016
This cake is supposed to be delivered

512
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,476
to our wedding tomorrow.

513
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,806
We're closed tomorrow. It's now or never.

514
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,976
No one ever mentioned that
to me when I placed the order.

515
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,726
How am I supposed to move this c

516
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,516
wait, that's wrong.

517
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,526
- Is that coconut cream?
- Yeah, vegan.

518
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,446
No. Deadly.
My husband is allergic to that.

519
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,066
- You're gonna have to redo it.
- Closed tomorrow.

520
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,116
Your husband doesn't have to eat it.

521
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,526
It's our wedding cake.

522
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,826
Hey. Hey.

523
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,366
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

524
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,366
Can you help me make
a new wedding cake?

525
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:59,076
No. God no.

526
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,796
I burn kitchens down.

527
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,416
But we can call in for reinforcements.

528
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,716
Hey, Randy.

529
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,256
I know I said I didn't want
a bachelor party,

530
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,756
but I need you to help me
get some guys together.

531
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:13,370
These are perfect!

532
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,436
This is a delightful bachelor party.

533
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,766
Not a bachelor party.

534
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,186
Hello.

535
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,606
Please do not be using
the masking tape.

536
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,526
We have this entzueckend floral tape.

537
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,316
Yeah, Randy watched
about 57 ClipTalk videos,

538
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,646
so he's the expert now.

539
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,566
Wesley was catching me up
on your lawsuit.

540
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,406
Yeah, I'm trying not to think about it.

541
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,776
The suit's frivolous. Judge will see that.

542
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,366
I'm not worried about the lawsuit.

543
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,696
I'm worried about Monica.

544
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,156
Oscar can't afford
15 minutes of her time,

545
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,956
much less full representation.

546
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,376
Elijah has to be bankrolling this.

547
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,996
Maybe, but Monica has plenty

548
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,416
other clients that hate the LAPD.

549
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,956
Whatever happens, maybe we just don't

550
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,796
talk about it at the wedding.

551
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,166
I'll tell Bailey later.

552
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,216
The timing couldn't be worse.

553
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,796
Leave it to Oscar to sue Nolan

554
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,296
the day before his wedding.

555
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,636
Wait, Oscar is suing John?

556
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,766
Please tell me your bachelorette party

557
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,386
will involve less baking
and more actual party.

558
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,346
That is a long way off,

559
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,936
if it's even in our future.

560
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,316
You and Tim are so great together.

561
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,646
We're great when she's not accusing me

562
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,896
of made-up transgressions.

563
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,696
Look, I'm not imagining things.

564
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,316
Tim is traumatized
by what happened with Isabel.

565
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,446
He just won't admit it.

566
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,066
Honestly, I think she's projecting

567
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,116
or just using this as an excuse.

568
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,736
Yeah, well, undercover work is

569
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,996
kind of scary and dangerous.

570
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,576
Maybe he's not the only one

571
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,706
that's scared of what might happen.

572
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,916
No. I'm fine.

573
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,166
He has the problem.

574
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,456
How do I prove that I'm not the problem?

575
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,796
I have an idea.

576
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,070
It's only ein wenig crazy.

577
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,256
<i>Hey.</i>

578
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,766
Hey, I gotta get out of here. This is sad.

579
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,886
<i>We can get dinner
at that Korean place you like.</i>

580
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:40,186
I can't. Look, I failed
with a drug mule today.

581
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,556
I really need to show Harper
what I'm capable of.

582
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,606
- What, by baking a cake?
- Whatever it takes.

583
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,880
See you tomorrow.

584
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,936
- That was Aaron.
- Yeah, I figured.

585
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,606
You guys are close nowadays.

586
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,656
Yeah.

587
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,366
Is that a problem?

588
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,986
It could be.

589
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,986
Look, you guys went
through a trauma together,

590
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,786
and it bonded you,
and that connection makes

591
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,456
every other relationship pale
in comparison.

592
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,996
But you cannot be
his entire support system.

593
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,586
Okay? That is a slow poison.

594
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:10,046
Okay. Yeah, I'll meet you there.

595
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,676
Tim wants me to meet him at the station.

596
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,756
Maybe he's ready to make up.

597
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,466
Or he has something to say
that's gonna make you

598
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,886
want to kill him, and he wants witnesses.

599
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,216
Man, if he wants to keep arguing,

600
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,886
I don't see the point.

601
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:22,766
Okay, the cake is almost done.

602
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,396
We just need to do the fondant flowers.

603
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,776
There's four different types,
and we need 20 of each.

604
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,130
Run.

605
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,236
Hey. Do you know where Tim is?

606
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,700
Yeah. I think he's in interrogation.

607
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,680
What?

608
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,876
What is happening right now?

609
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,996
I am gonna prove to you
that I'm rooting for you.

610
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,586
With a lie detector test?

611
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:54,176
- Yes.
- Wait, so I can ask anything?

612
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,886
Well, I mean, the point is
for you to ask me

613
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:57,966
about you making detective, you know,

614
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,386
working undercover, that sort of thing.

615
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,926
Sure.

616
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:06,146
But, I mean, you did go through
all this trouble, right?

617
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,516
We should be thorough, don't you think?

618
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,710
What do you want to ask?

619
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,696
When I have you trap bugs
in my apartment,

620
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,220
do you release them outside like I ask?

621
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,456
No.

622
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,166
True? I knew it. You just kill them?

623
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,190
Yes. Because they're bugs.

624
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,900
Okay.

625
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,660
Do you love me?

626
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,186
Yes.

627
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,936
I love you.

628
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,670
True.

629
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:55,776
Okay.

630
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,946
You ready?

631
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,486
- Big one.
- Ready.

632
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,786
Do you want me to be
an undercover detective?

633
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,100
Yes.

634
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,100
You liar.

635
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,210
I guess we really do have a problem.

636
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,716
Today is the day.

637
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,926
It is.

638
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,926
It's gonna be great.

639
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,766
As long as we're married at the end of it,

640
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,660
I'll be happy.

641
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,016
Why do you taste like frosting?

642
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,896
New face serum.

643
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,066
That's nice.

644
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,226
This is nice.

645
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,526
Let's just snuggle in peace

646
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,930
for a little while longer.

647
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,696
Okay.

648
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,456
And the moment is over.

649
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,786
Next time we get married,
no houseguests.

650
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,036
- Yeah, yeah.
- Where's Henry?

651
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,166
He was supposed to get in last night.

652
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,626
Landing at Andrews, I think.

653
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,626
Why would he be landing
at an air force base?

654
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,466
Did I forget to mention

655
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,796
that he had some travel complications?

656
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,596
Yes, you did.

657
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,216
Same way you forgot to mention

658
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,806
that Oscar is suing you
and that's why you had

659
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,096
to give up your phone yesterday.

660
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,646
Touché. I didn't want to worry you.

661
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,936
Exactly.

662
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,976
Henry should make it in time
for the ceremony, though.

663
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,946
Well, that's all that matters.

664
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,566
- Let's go get married.
- Let's do it.

665
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,776
You look amazing.

666
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,986
I mean, the one-shoulder was great too,

667
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,616
but this is my favorite.

668
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,196
Thank you. I was torn.

669
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,496
The other one had a beautiful color,

670
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,916
but it did not go with the shoes.

671
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,996
And if you swap out the shoes,

672
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,496
then the handbag doesn't work.

673
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,916
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

674
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,206
So I went with a suit.

675
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,796
Hey, me too.

676
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,796
Mine has a tie.

677
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,900
My God, same.

678
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,186
So how long did you stay?

679
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,436
I bailed right after we talked.

680
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,896
You know, it doesn't seem
like you're hanging out

681
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,946
with the other guys much.

682
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,276
I guess not.

683
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,236
I'd rather hang out with you.

684
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,486
Yeah, but it can't hurt, though,

685
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,286
having more people to talk to,
plus your shrink.

686
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,496
What, you trying to get rid of me?

687
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,246
Never. Never.

688
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,246
Just... just looking out for you.

689
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,576
Thanks.

690
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,060
You're the best.

691
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,256
By the way, I read
your book club selection.

692
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,296
When Elsie died in childbirth,
I must admit, I cried.

693
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,306
Me too. That was awful.

694
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,266
And when it turned out
that the doctor's mother

695
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,476
was alive the whole time...

696
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,346
Well, that I saw coming.

697
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,766
None of that happened
in the book, did it?

698
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,896
No. What's going on?

699
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,726
After everything
that happened with Aaron,

700
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,276
I saw how much good I could do
working in the hospital.

701
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,066
So I decided to finish
my social work degree.

702
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,116
That's where I've been going at night.

703
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,736
Why the subterfuge?

704
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,906
I was worried I'd get three classes in

705
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,326
and realize I couldn't hack it.

706
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,746
Going back after all
these years, it was scary.

707
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,576
I did not want to have to worry
about disappointing you.

708
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,586
As if you could.

709
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,586
Okay, so how are you doing?

710
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,126
Top of my class.

711
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,666
Graduate next week.

712
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,716
Hospital job starts the week after.

713
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,176
I was gonna tell you this weekend.

714
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,806
- You go, girl.
- I was gonna...

715
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,306
That's good.

716
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,596
Pardon me one second.

717
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,886
Small problem.

718
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,136
Father O'Malley's stuck in traffic.

719
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,976
Okay. Should we wait?

720
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,976
He's in Chatsworth.

721
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,316
So no. Okay.

722
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,566
Sorry, everyone, if I could just get

723
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,816
your attention for one minute.

724
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,316
I realize this is literally last-minute.

725
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,026
Is anyone here qualified
to officiate a wedding?

726
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,406
I can.

727
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,536
As a minister
of the Universal Life Church,

728
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,286
I would be honored
to marry you two crazy kids.

729
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,996
- Sit down, German.
- Okay.

730
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,860
- I got this.
- Thank you.

731
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,886
Here, I'll take that.

732
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,960
Please be seated.

733
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,356
You are all here today
because you love these two.

734
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,946
They're here to make
a commitment under God

735
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,906
in front of family and friends

736
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,526
to love, honor, and cherish each other

737
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,446
for the rest of their lives.

738
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,770
Bailey.

739
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,206
I'm suddenly so nervous.

740
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,916
There is nothing,

741
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,296
literally nothing else in my life

742
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,796
I am as certain of as marrying you.

743
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,136
I must have written
a hundred different vows

744
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,296
and I threw them all away

745
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,596
'cause there were too many words.

746
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,910
And the way you make me feel
is so simple to express.

747
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,316
I feel loved and seen

748
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,356
and desired and happy.

749
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,180
For that, I will love you forever and a day.

750
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,430
That's your ring.

751
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,150
- My turn.
- Yes.

752
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,546
Bailey Nune,

753
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:12,256
you came into my life
in a towel on my doorstep

754
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,766
with an unlikely story
about being locked out

755
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,096
by a meddlesome dog.

756
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,436
And I remember thinking,

757
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,846
"I'm either being conned by a hot model,

758
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,226
or I have just met
the woman of my dreams."

759
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,606
You're damn right I love and cherish you.

760
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:31,236
You are the most impressive
person I've ever met.

761
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,850
And I wake up every morning
to the dream of being your man.

762
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:41,826
And I promise that making you happy

763
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:46,046
will be my everyday everything.

764
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,626
Well, there's nothing
I can say to top that,

765
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,846
so I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

766
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,700
Kiss your bride.

767
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,840
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mrs. and Mr. John Nolan.

768
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:18,866
- Hey, Randy.
- James.

769
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:20,616
What a lucky man to be married

770
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,746
to the beautiful and terrifying
Detective Harper.

771
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,576
I couldn't agree more.

772
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,586
Hey, I was wondering
if I could share a playlist.

773
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,940
What, to...

774
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:38,806
So, what, you just had
this playlist ready to go?

775
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,176
I set it up the minute that you mentioned

776
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,556
Randy was the DJ.

777
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,260
- That's why I love you.
- I got your back.

778
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,136
Tim and Lucy are gonna be okay?

779
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,386
I'm sure they'll work it out.

780
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,010
- You want to get some air?
- Yeah, sure.

781
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,500
Okay.

782
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,736
You know Mercury is merging
into Pisces right now,

783
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,736
which tends to amplify psychic activity,

784
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,576
especially for people born
with Mercury in Pisces.

785
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,906
And that means?

786
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,946
Just pay attention to your dreams

787
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,616
for the next couple of weeks.

788
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,286
The cosmos might be trying
to tell you something.

789
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:49,456
Yeah, well, my dreams
are mainly, um... violent.

790
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,256
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

791
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,716
Yeah, I haven't told anyone that.

792
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,216
Not even the shrink.

793
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,216
Okay, isn't that exactly the kind of stuff

794
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,296
you're supposed to be telling her?

795
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,306
If I'm trying to get better, yes.

796
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:04,846
If I'm trying to get back on patrol, no.

797
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,056
I mean, you're the only person

798
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,806
that I can talk to about all this.

799
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,190
And I will always be here for you.

800
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,356
Aaron.

801
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,896
I...

802
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,106
No, I thought

803
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,236
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

804
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,616
- I'm so... I am so sorry.
- It's fine.

805
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,696
I just... I just don't

806
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,076
yeah, well, I'm gonna go grab a drink.

807
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,640
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

808
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,770
No.

809
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:41,926
Hello?

810
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,846
<i>Hey, it's Seth.</i>

811
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:46,636
<i>Flower pot heroin guy. Allegedly.</i>

812
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:49,596
<i>- You were right... I need help.
- They're hunting for me.</i>

813
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,000
Send me your address.
I'll come pick you up.

814
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,550
Tequila shots. Keep 'em coming.

815
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,516
Clearly, I'm more conflicted
about you working undercover

816
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,856
than I realized.

817
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,976
It's understandable.

818
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,606
Losing Isabel in such a horrible way,

819
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:39,736
I mean, how could you
possibly be over that?

820
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,156
Yeah, but it's unfair to you.

821
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,816
I need to deal with it.

822
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,616
You know, your dream
should have nothing

823
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,326
to do with my issues.

824
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,246
Thank you.

825
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,586
We're gonna get through this.

826
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,520
I love you.

827
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:04,966
Well, you say that, but till I put you

828
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:06,676
under a lie detector, how can I be sure?

829
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,176
No, not a chance.

830
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,516
I'm not doing it.

831
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:12,186
You guys made up. Awesome.

832
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,806
- Yeah.
- Everyone was so worried.

833
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:16,316
They were like... I told them, "It's fine."

834
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,436
"They're solid," so...

835
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,106
Whoa, how much have you had to drink?

836
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,696
I don't know. Who cares?

837
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,356
Well, you should, because as cops,

838
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,776
we're always
one person's bad choice away

839
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,986
from being on duty.

840
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,696
Hey, where... where's Celina?

841
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,446
I don't know. Why would I know?

842
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,616
It's not like we're together, so

843
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,576
yeah, all right.

844
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,730
See ya.

845
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,056
Come on!

846
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,386
No, no! All right, all right.

847
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,130
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

848
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,766
- Celina?
- Hey, I'm in trouble.

849
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,266
Gallegos called me.

850
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:00,050
He called me...

851
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,606
Celina's in trouble.
She went to meet a CI.

852
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,616
- Where?
- I don't know.

853
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,616
Call was cut off. I'm waiting

854
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,736
on a warrant for her phone.

855
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,736
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

856
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,736
Something with Celina.

857
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,746
This is Grey.

858
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,246
I have an officer in distress.

859
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,746
I need a dedicated airship

860
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,826
and citywide alert pending location.

861
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,536
I'll get Metro on standby.

862
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,666
- We gotta get changed.
- Give me your keys.

863
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,296
I'll grab your go bags out of your cars.

864
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,836
- Thank you.
- I'll go with you. Come on.

865
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,256
All right, Celina is downtown.

866
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,926
They're waiting
on a more precise location.

867
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,256
We'll get it on our way.

868
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,886
- I am sorry, I have to go.
- I know. I know.

869
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,506
Just please don't die
on our wedding night.

870
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:31,016
Hey, I heard
something happened to Celina.

871
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,346
- Is she okay?
- We don't know.

872
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,056
We're going downtown to find her.

873
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,516
Okay, I'm coming with you.

874
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,646
No, you're drunk and not
cleared for active duty.

875
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,646
Sit your ass down and do some praying.

876
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:37,726
We got him.

877
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,266
Hey, handsome.

878
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,896
Hey, let's get some coffee in you, yeah?

879
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,170
Yeah.

880
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,240
She's not here.

881
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,806
Start a grid search.

882
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,096
Whittier to 1st to the 10.

883
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,186
They took her by car.

884
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,040
She could be anywhere right now.

885
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,146
Guys, I got some blood over here.

886
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,050
Looks like somebody got
dragged that way.

887
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,796
Two male suspects. One gun visible.

888
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,256
We gotta get past 'em to get inside.

889
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,756
Get it done.

890
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,030
Harper, Lopez,
we'll breach from the back.

891
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,346
All right, how do you want to play this?

892
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,580
Take off your tie.

893
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,506
Right here. Down on your knees.

894
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,666
Here. I'll stay with them.

895
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,400
You guys go.

896
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,226
Last chance... tell me where my stuff is,

897
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:29,880
or I will cut your throat
and move on to your girlfriend.

898
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,486
All right, it's a tactical nightmare in there.

899
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,656
There's no way to get
in there quickly enough

900
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,770
to neutralize them and save Celina.

901
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,956
What the...

902
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,166
Sarge.

903
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,190
Give me his jacket.

904
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,136
- Time's up.
- Hey, hey. Come on.

905
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,830
Aah!

906
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,976
Hey! Hey!

907
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,186
Put your hands in the air!

908
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,420
- Police, hands up!
- Police!

909
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,106
Police! Show me your hands!

910
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,696
Show me your hands!

911
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,526
Not to judge,

912
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,736
I think you would have had
more fun at the wedding.

913
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,890
No kidding.

914
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,360
Bailey?

915
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,136
How's it going?

916
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,226
I can't move my body.

917
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,896
Did I finish packing for our honeymoon?

918
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,306
Yeah, almost.

919
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,186
I say we buy clothes there.

920
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,146
That is genius.
I mean, what do we need anyway?

921
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,946
- Just bathing suits.
- Yeah.

922
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,406
Wow.

923
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,986
I'm so sorry I bailed on the wedding.

924
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,946
You didn't miss much.

925
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,760
The cake was kind of a disaster.

926
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,270
How much longer before
we have to be at the airport?

927
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,546
Four hours.

928
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:15,716
There's plenty of time for a little nap.

929
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,586
Siri, wake me in an hour.

930
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,596
Yeah.

931
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:23,040
<i>I didn't get that. Could you try again?</i>

932
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,910
<i>Damn it.</i>
