1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,216
Celina, look out!

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,946
Officer down.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,040
Help him.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,786
Tell me what you're feeling.

5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,026
Frustration.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,266
But not fear?

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,406
No.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,516
Today was the first
time during this exercise

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,826
that your heart rate didn't spike.

10
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,726
You remained calm.

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,626
Why do you think that is?

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,006
Because I know

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,766
there's no way I could have
stopped what happened.

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,426
That's right. The men
who ambushed you

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:39,286
and officer juarez rigged the game.

16
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,256
No matter which way you
turned, whether you split up

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,286
or stayed together,
even if you called it in,

18
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,946
none of that would
have made a difference

19
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,156
because they were ready.

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,846
One of you was gonna
be shot that night.

21
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,056
And who knows?

22
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,336
If you hadn't made the decisions you did,

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,576
maybe it would have
been celina, instead of you.

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,646
No, you're... you're right.

25
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,096
Um, I've been blaming myself.

26
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,646
Like, if I had been smarter,

27
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,066
I could have somehow avoided it.

28
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,510
But it was out of my control.

29
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,556
Congratulations, officer thorsen.

30
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,866
In my professional opinion,

31
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,836
you are ready to return to active duty.

32
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,156
I'm just really excited to get back to work.

33
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,126
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,486
Look, I told you I'm fine.

35
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,076
I'll just retake the
detective's exam in two years.

36
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,146
It's not a big deal.

37
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,726
You know, every time a woman in my life

38
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,526
has said she was fine,
she most definitely was not.

39
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,186
I'm not gonna pretend like I
wasn't a little disappointed.

40
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,226
But I've made my peace with it.

41
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,326
Plus, I'm a professional.

42
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,676
- Unless you want me to be upset.
- No, of course not.

43
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,916
Hey, Lucy, I heard
about the detective exam.

44
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,816
- Tough break.
- Yes, thank you.

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,546
I'm fine.

46
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,096
Whenever Bailey
says she's fine like that,

47
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,756
I up my life insurance.

48
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,516
There he is.

49
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,036
Everyone drive safe out there.

50
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,726
Thorsen is back in the shop.

51
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,106
As always, detective,

52
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,726
your unwavering support
means the world to me.

53
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,216
Don't fret.

54
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,076
In Harper speak, that's
practically an "I love you."

55
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,660
Bradford, got a minute?

56
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,186
Congrats on being cleared.

57
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,396
- Thanks.
- So any nerves?

58
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,816
Not really.

59
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,606
Um, I feel strong in
mind, body, and spirit.

60
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,506
- I'm ready.
- Thorsen's not ready.

61
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,366
What's the first thing an officer returning

62
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,786
from injury worries about?

63
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,096
Gettin' hurt again.

64
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,686
Especially after a
near-fatal like thorsen's.

65
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,896
You afraid he's gonna go
turtle up when things get real?

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,346
I don't wanna wait to find out.

67
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,656
In this business, we don't
have the luxury of do-overs.

68
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,106
So you want me to take him out today

69
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,286
to get punched in the face.

70
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,426
Officially, I want you
to supervise his ability

71
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,946
to cope with stress,
both mental and physical.

72
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,916
You got it.

73
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,226
Let's see how he does against the train.

74
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,986
Thorsen, you're with me.

75
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,466
Metro needs a support officer.

76
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,220
Oh, um, yes, sir.

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,336
Ooh.

78
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,020
You know what it means
to "turtle up," thorsen?

79
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,236
I don't think so, sir.

80
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,306
It happens when an officer returns

81
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,796
to the job after a trauma,

82
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:23,966
put under some kind of pressure,

83
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,726
usually physical, for the first time.

84
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,346
Instead of falling back on their training,

85
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,186
they shrink into a shell,
where they feel safe.

86
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,696
So you think I'm gonna turtle up?

87
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,016
Maybe.

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,286
If you do, there are lots
of companies looking

89
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,226
for delivery guys with
a good driving record.

90
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,326
Well, actually, my
fallback career is gonna be

91
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,946
influencer/shoe designer.

92
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,606
But I-I see what you're saying.

93
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,336
So that's why I'm riding with you.

94
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,856
So I gotta pass, what, some
type of Tim test so I don't...

95
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,136
It's called the train.

96
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,716
Stands for tactical, responsive, assertive,

97
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,236
investigative, and nerve.

98
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,376
And I'm gonna test you
on all five major functions

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,726
in stress environments.

100
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,456
Evaluate, improvise,
adapt, and overcome.

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,796
You ready for this?

102
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,596
Bring it on.

103
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,946
So how did you like riding
with sergeant Bradford?

104
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,636
It was very educational.

105
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,706
Both he and detective Harper
have very distinctive styles.

106
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,196
Dispatch, you said the rp was
on the south side of the park?

107
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,816
Affirmative, 7-Adam-15.

108
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,616
Okay, so did they, like,
say anything about me?

109
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,096
They did.

110
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,856
Like all rookies, you
are a work in progress.

111
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,966
Over here!

112
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,316
Hi, I'm officer Nolan.

113
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,586
This is officer juarez.

114
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,796
You called about a body?

115
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,346
Yeah, it's, in there.

116
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,626
Um, someone jammed the lock,

117
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,666
but when I finally got it open, she...

118
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,766
She was just lying there

119
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,256
it's okay. It's okay. Stay here.

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,976
We're gonna need to get some
information from you, okay?

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,040
Okay?

122
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,570
- After you.
- Yep.

123
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:15,186
Overdose?

124
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,386
No.

125
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,736
Lividity in the cheeks.

126
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,426
She died facedown and was moved here.

127
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,366
Looks like a homicide. Let's call it in.

128
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,366
Control, requesting detectives

129
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,080
for a possible homicide.

130
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,166
Welcome to your first test.

131
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,026
Let me guess... that's
the stress environment?

132
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,346
It's a little more than that.

133
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,866
Man inside is Tyson
kalashnikov, 6'4", 275.

134
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,796
Has a warrant for a
missed court appearance.

135
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,766
Last time he was arrested,
he broke the cop's nose.

136
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,936
I assume calling for backup is cheating?

137
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,076
Train's leaving, officer thorsen.

138
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,520
Okay, let's do this.

139
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,156
Police! Open up!

140
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,266
It's open.

141
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,696
Clear!

142
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,626
Tyson, show yourself!

143
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,320
Could one of you get me a beer?

144
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,096
I moved the picnic blanket
so we could examine her head.

145
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,096
She was definitely moved postmortem.

146
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,540
Obvious blunt force trauma to the head.

147
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,236
What's this under her shirt?

148
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,386
What is that?

149
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:55,620
It's the signature of the pentagram killer.

150
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,256
Pardon us just one moment.

151
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,706
So the pentagram killer is wanted

152
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,536
in connection to a string
of unsolved homicides

153
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,746
in the early 2000s.

154
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,746
His victims were all
middle-aged females.

155
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,026
He'd carve a pentagram

156
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,126
into their midsections
after he killed them.

157
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,096
Then in 2009, he just stopped.

158
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,516
Hulu just dropped a docuseries on him.

159
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,546
Maybe the renewed
notoriety inspired him

160
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,546
to come out of retirement.

161
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,756
The hysteria was real.

162
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,036
I was away at college,

163
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,416
and I made my brothers
escort my mom everywhere.

164
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,206
Scary that they never caught the guy.

165
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,456
Well, the city threw
everything they had at it,

166
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,496
multiple agencies working 24/7.

167
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,596
My first sergeant was on the task force.

168
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,046
Speaking of, whenever we respond

169
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,086
to a potentially high-profile event,

170
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,606
it's important to notify
the watch commander.

171
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,536
Yes, sir.

172
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,296
Adam-200, be advised, our
db might be a possible victim

173
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,606
of the pentagram killer.

174
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,476
Officer juarez!

175
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,266
Did I do something wrong?

176
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,896
As her to, that is on you.

177
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,236
Yes, ma'am. I am sorry, ma'am.

178
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,276
Officer Suarez, I should
have been clearer.

179
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,276
You never give out that
kind of sensitive information

180
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,486
over the radio.

181
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,416
Now every news organization or hobbyist

182
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,076
with a scanner has it.

183
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,356
- My god.
- I didn't think that

184
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,426
did I hear someone say

185
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,456
"pentagram killer" on the radio?

186
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,116
- Um...
- I'm... I'm so sorry.

187
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,016
Is that really bad?

188
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,426
Cases like this capture
the public's attention.

189
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,916
People call in with tips,
trying to be a part of it.

190
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,676
But most of them are a
complete waste of time.

191
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,196
Yeah, because when people panic,

192
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,916
they call 911 at every bump in the night.

193
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:23,166
So no, that... that was not ideal.

194
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,446
Okay, is there anything I can do to help?

195
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:27,096
Just take the witness back to the station,

196
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,516
and maybe stay off the radio.

197
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,966
Yes, ma'am. We're on it.

198
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,446
I'm sorry.

199
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,200
Come on.

200
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,516
You want me to start canvassing?

201
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,936
No, we need to secure
the perimeter first.

202
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,286
Um, there's no one
watching the northwest corner.

203
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,730
Probably because it's
where the hell dumpsters are.

204
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,016
Yeah, of course. Whatever you need.

205
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,706
As a patrol officer, I'm here
to support your investigation

206
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:53,056
- in any way that I can.
- Great.

207
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,366
We're gonna head back to the station

208
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,816
and dig into this case file

209
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,686
and let crime scene do their thing.

210
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,246
Come here.

211
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,906
Got it?

212
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,076
Yo, just lean him up against the car.

213
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,420
Control, Bradford, can I get a
transport Van to our location?

214
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,816
What's that?

215
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,396
No idea.

216
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,366
I'll check it out.

217
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,460
Tyson?

218
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,546
Tyson? It's me.

219
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,616
Hi.

220
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,856
You looking for Tyson?

221
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,376
- Have you heard the good news?
- What good news?

222
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,446
Our lord and savior has
come to save our souls.

223
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,246
Well, amen, sister.

224
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:49,006
- Ha.
- Can I see some ID?

225
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,596
Ma'am?

226
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,396
Excuse me. Ma'am.

227
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,096
No!

228
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,016
Hey, Harper, I just found a pile of vomit

229
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,816
on the far northwest corner of the park.

230
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,436
Lucky you.

231
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,646
It's unlikely to be related,

232
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,856
but we still need to collect it, just in case.

233
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,366
I will have tid process it

234
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,716
as soon as they're done with the scene.

235
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,376
Oh, um, how long do
you think that'll take?

236
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,896
A couple hours, four tops.

237
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,726
In the meantime, keep an eye on it.

238
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:55,100
It's my lucky... it's my lucky day.

239
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,386
- I wouldn't want to be her.
- Ooh.

240
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,736
Man, that man is an olympic-level yeller.

241
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,606
You got an ID on our Vic?

242
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:09,676
Yeah, Cheryl budny, 42,
works at Lincoln junior high.

243
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,986
She left at her usual
time around 5:00 P.M

244
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,096
didn't show up today.

245
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,476
She live close by the park?

246
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,126
No, culver city.

247
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,436
So that means that the dump site

248
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,336
is most likely related to the killer.

249
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,896
Yeah, Cheryl's brother
lives over in little Armenia.

250
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,996
He should be here any minute.

251
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,346
I reserved interview three for us.

252
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,780
Great.

253
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,766
You still have all your fingers and toes?

254
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,386
Sergeant grey was very fair.

255
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,486
And again, I'm... I'm very sorry.

256
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,736
Don't worry about us.

257
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,046
It's you guys who are
gonna pay the price.

258
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,386
What do you mean?

259
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:37,736
Any more evidence pointing
to the pentagram killer?

260
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,466
Some of the signature qualities match

261
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,466
his previous victims, but
all are public knowledge.

262
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:44,746
Which means we can't
decisively say it's him.

263
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,536
Nolan, I need you guys 10-8.

264
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,646
Calls are backing up.

265
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,096
26 pending related to the pentagram.

266
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,996
And that's the price.

267
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,026
Cheryl's next of kin is on his way.

268
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,166
Call us if you get anything interesting.

269
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,440
Phone call. On the phone.

270
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,046
All right, what have
we got, officer thorsen?

271
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,526
Well, she attempted to contact

272
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,876
a well-known criminal and one suspect.

273
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,976
She ran when she saw
my uniform, giving me

274
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,736
probable cause to believe
that she also was engaged

275
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,876
in criminal activity.

276
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,676
And she also held $15,000 in cash.

277
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,746
And cash is frequently used

278
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,956
to finance and conceal criminal activity.

279
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,306
Not bad.

280
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,646
Is that enough to arrest?

281
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,236
I mean, she tried to scratch my face off.

282
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,786
So there's a 1-48 right there.

283
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,416
But I'm actually more interested

284
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,796
in why she had all that money on her.

285
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,656
Good. Under stress,
you made a tactical entry.

286
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,556
You were responsive to criminal activity

287
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,936
and assertive when she tried to run.

288
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,796
You may build this train just yet.

289
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,906
Well, what about "nerve"?

290
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,906
I mean, she hit me with her bag,

291
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,906
and did you see her nails?

292
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,976
Nope.

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,016
Hurry up and process 'em.

294
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,366
We got work to do.

295
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,226
Jeff budny?

296
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:54,746
I'm detective Lopez.

297
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,916
This is detective Harper.

298
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,166
If you follow us, we have a room set up.

299
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,506
I got 30 minutes left on my lunch break.

300
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,096
Can't you just say whatever it
is you need to say right here?

301
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,586
Well, we're sorry to have to tell you this,

302
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,586
but it's about your sister, Cheryl.

303
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,246
What about her?

304
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,990
She's deceased.

305
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,046
What?

306
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,246
What happened?

307
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,356
It was a homicide.

308
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,016
- I'm so sorry.
- A homicide?

309
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,086
Wait, wait, wait.

310
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,046
That's... when? How?

311
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,806
Listen, I know this is difficult,

312
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,056
but we really would like to
speak with you somewhere

313
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,576
where there's more privacy.

314
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,916
Just tell me what happened to my sister.

315
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,576
They discovered her
body in a park this morning.

316
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,886
And that's really all we can say right now.

317
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,236
That's all you can say?

318
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,236
Did you two get along?

319
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,996
I mean, when was the last
time you saw or spoke with her?

320
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,066
We were tight, all right? I don't know.

321
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,136
I talked to her a couple days ago.

322
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,796
Wednesday, maybe. I don't know.

323
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,556
Can you think of anyone
who wanted to harm her?

324
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,866
No.

325
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,386
She worked at a grade school.

326
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,836
Well, I'm sorry, but I have to ask,

327
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,116
what were you doing last night?

328
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,466
You mean while my
sister was being murdered?

329
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,606
Yeah, watching the
laker game at Barney's.

330
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,126
20 people can vouch for me.

331
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,466
Listen, I know you're upset,
and I cannot even imagine

332
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,816
what you are going through right now.

333
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,716
But the more you give us,

334
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,306
the faster we can find who did this.

335
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,756
I can't do this right now, okay?

336
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,136
There's people I need to call.

337
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,276
My mom, jeez. I gotta call my mom.

338
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,756
We understand, but as soon as possible,

339
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,966
we need to sit down with
you and get a full statement.

340
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,006
Call us when you're ready.

341
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,240
Any time, day or night.

342
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,806
Well, he seems genuinely upset.

343
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,146
Yeah, still gonna check that alibi, though.

344
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,466
Damn straight.

345
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,536
All right, sarge, both
suspects are booked.

346
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,986
Do you want a medal?

347
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,086
No, sir.

348
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,576
I just really would like to figure out

349
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,606
what a suburban housewife
was doing with all that cash.

350
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,856
And why bring it to Tyson?

351
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,816
Opioids, gambling, debt, pirated movies.

352
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,096
Who knows? Who cares?

353
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,506
They never completed the transaction.

354
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,996
If there's more to it,

355
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,166
shouldn't we dig a little deeper?

356
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,036
Good.

357
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,936
The I in train stands
for investigative initiative.

358
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,276
That's two I's.

359
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,936
Never mind.

360
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,796
You don't get the I
unless it's under stress.

361
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,936
So we're gonna make this interesting.

362
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,736
You've got nine minutes

363
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,116
to get to the bottom of this.

364
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,086
If you can't, I'm gonna
recommend we extend

365
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,116
your probation and return
you to the fto program.

366
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,126
Nine minutes? Why not ten?

367
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,956
Now it's eight minutes, 47 seconds.

368
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,746
Ticktock.

369
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,926
So why were you attempting
to pay Tyson kalashnikov

370
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,656
$15,000 in cash?

371
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,346
'Cause he's my gigolo.

372
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,516
I got a thing for guys
who can't move their arms.

373
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,006
Hello?

374
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,936
Yes, arm casts. Very sexy.

375
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,556
Your husband's in prison.

376
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,596
I mean, your husband is Austin Walker,

377
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,426
doing three to five in San Quentin

378
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,606
for embezzlement.

379
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,846
- Is that right?
- Austin made a mistake.

380
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,706
Yeah, one with very
serious consequences.

381
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,886
Now, did you know

382
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,266
that Tyson did four
stints in San Quentin?

383
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,096
And that's where he's
heading back to now.

384
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,376
And it looks like he's also the lieutenant

385
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,586
of the devil's crown prison gang.

386
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,856
They run your husband's prison.

387
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,346
Okay, so connecting those dots,

388
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,766
I'm guessing that you paid Tyson

389
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,006
to keep your husband
safe while he's inside.

390
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,006
Is that what's happening?

391
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,256
Tyson said that if I didn't pay
him the money by tomorrow,

392
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,986
Austin was as good as dead.

393
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,676
He's all I have. I didn't have a choice.

394
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,466
I didn't... I didn't know what else to do.

395
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,056
Okay, look, don't worry.

396
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,740
All right? I'm gonna help you.

397
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,376
Sir, I need to call the prison
and have Austin Walker put

398
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,966
into protective custody, like, right now.

399
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,066
Already done, and you
still have 25 seconds.

400
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:38,386
Are you sure your
investigation is complete?

401
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,696
Yeah, I think so.

402
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,936
I mean, it's just a
classic protection racket.

403
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,736
Are you asking me,
or are you telling me?

404
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,906
No, I'm telling... I'm telling you.

405
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:45,946
Okay.

406
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,976
Unless I'm missing something.

407
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,046
I didn't say that.

408
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,660
Time's up.

409
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,126
Ooh, listen to this one.

410
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,706
A man says that his neighbor's cat

411
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,786
is possessed by the pentagram.

412
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,436
There's gotta be one tip on that call line

413
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,336
that is not totally insane.

414
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,756
Let's see.

415
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,996
A lady with a devil-worshipping nephew.

416
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,926
- Skip it.
- Teenage girl thought

417
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,686
that her mailman was the pentagram

418
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,416
and was there to snatch her.

419
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,176
She actually sprayed him with a hose.

420
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,076
- Next.
- Old lady claims her husband

421
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,006
committed the murders
while he was on shore leave.

422
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,146
Was he in the Navy?

423
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,876
It looks like commercial fisherman.

424
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,906
- Attach us to that.
- Really?

425
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,356
Commercial fisherman work a lot at night

426
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,636
perfect excuse to be out late, hunting.

427
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,466
All of our victims had ligature
marks from being tied up.

428
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,646
You know who's really
good at tying knots?

429
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,816
- Fishermen?
- Bingo.

430
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,306
Mrs. Opal Jesper?

431
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,230
We're here about a tip you called in.

432
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,766
I'm... I'm sorry.

433
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,836
I shouldn't have done
that. It was a mistake.

434
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,046
Ma'am...

435
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,386
You said your husband
is the pentagram killer.

436
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,620
That does not sound like a mistake.

437
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,210
I didn't know what to do.

438
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,090
I found this.

439
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,276
Sandra Owens.

440
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,890
That's the first victim.

441
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,556
Ma'am, where is your
husband right now?

442
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,286
He's been dead for seven years.

443
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:41,786
Probably more inside.
Thanks very much.

444
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,856
Thanks.

445
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,546
What's gonna happen to me?

446
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,896
Well, the detectives are gonna have

447
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,686
a few more questions
for you back at the station.

448
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,796
At the station?

449
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,556
- Will you be there?
- No, ma'am.

450
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,416
I'm a patrol officer, not an investigator.

451
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,456
Um, I'll tell you what.

452
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,626
Why don't you take my card?

453
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,286
If you need anything, give me a call.

454
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,186
My mobile number's on there, all right?

455
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,636
If you'll excuse us just for a moment?

456
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,450
Thanks.

457
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,676
Hey.

458
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,846
That widow looks like
she's sweet on you.

459
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,266
Yeah, Nolan gave her his number.

460
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,296
Yes, I was trying to build rapport.

461
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,786
- Did it work?
- Hard to say.

462
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,266
She insists she didn't know
anything about the murders

463
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,646
until after her husband died
and she found the trophies.

464
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,206
I mean, how could she not have known?

465
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,486
Well, her husband wasn't
on the original suspect list,

466
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:29,796
which means that he was
good at flying under the radar.

467
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,626
Well, at least we can
eliminate the pentagram killer

468
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,316
as a suspect in Cheryl budny's case.

469
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,356
Let's hope his copycat isn't as skilled

470
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,836
at covering his tracks.

471
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,256
Nolan, juarez.

472
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,876
So I understand you took the call.

473
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,186
Yes, sir. We got lucky.

474
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,946
Well, actually, officer Nolan picked it out.

475
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,226
- He thought it sounded credible.
- Nice catch.

476
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,326
Look, the mayor asked me
to give a press conference

477
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:50,126
announcing the identity
of the pentagram killer.

478
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,816
I'd like you two to be there
so I can recognize your work.

479
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,476
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

480
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,660
All right, go get cleaned
up. You're gonna be on TV.

481
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,686
Do you think I have time for a blowout?

482
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,966
Absolutely not.

483
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:03,440
- No?
- Come on.

484
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,906
You ready?

485
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,146
Yeah.

486
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,836
Let's go.

487
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,210
Is that the widow?

488
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,210
It must be.

489
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,056
You know, I almost attached to that call.

490
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,366
But I got pulled to a 2-11 that
turned out to be a false alarm.

491
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,926
Then you'd be the one on TV,

492
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:31,026
and primm would have realized
what a giant mistake he made

493
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,276
torpedoing your detective's exam.

494
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,306
Yeah, something like that.

495
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:38,936
Instead, I spent the day
breathing in hot dumpster fumes

496
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,766
while standing guard over a pile of puke

497
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,216
for three hours on the off chance

498
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,426
it belonged to our killer.

499
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,836
- Did it?
- Nope.

500
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,046
It was a sick dog.

501
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,636
Okay, so you had a crappy day.

502
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,666
You've had 'em before,
and you'll have 'em again.

503
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,296
The best part about being on patrol is

504
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,946
you never know what's gonna happen.

505
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,946
Maybe tomorrow, you'll be the big hero.

506
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,466
I would just settle for not having to deal

507
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,026
with any bodily fluids.

508
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,786
Yeah, don't be too greedy.

509
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,376
So do you really believe
the widow had no idea?

510
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,376
I don't know. I mean, there was a time

511
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,246
when I couldn't have
conceived of not being able to tell

512
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,416
that my partner was keeping
something from me, but

513
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,726
then I went and hid a
whole husband from you.

514
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,906
Yeah, pretty much. But you know what?

515
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:20,936
Getting through that made us stronger.

516
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,426
- Yeah.
- What about you?

517
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,046
Do you think if you
found out I was a murderer

518
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,046
would you turn me in?

519
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:26,466
Absolutely.

520
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,946
Not a moment's hesitation.

521
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,226
I think you should be more
worried if I did hesitate.

522
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,536
- Yeah.
- What about you?

523
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,156
Well, as a cop, it'd be
my duty to arrest you.

524
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,096
But I have to say, I would be pretty handy

525
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,366
at helping you hide a body.

526
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,066
So romantic.

527
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,920
I know, right?

528
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,066
Hey.

529
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,106
How'd today go?

530
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,246
Good, I think.

531
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,836
Sergeant Bradford said
something to me today

532
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,666
that made me think I need
to dig deeper on our case,

533
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,666
but you ever read something ten times

534
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,876
and still feel like you're
missing the point of it?

535
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,776
Performing under
pressure takes many forms.

536
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,816
Sometimes physical,
so you feel nervous.

537
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,816
Other times, mental.

538
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,816
And you just can't see
the forest from the trees.

539
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,336
Yeah, well, all I can see is trees.

540
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,826
So any advice?

541
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,166
Yeah, stop thinking about it.

542
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,276
Take a walk.

543
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,306
Take a shower.

544
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,106
Turn your brain off.

545
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,446
Let your mind find the answer.

546
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,936
In other words, go home.

547
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,346
Yes, sir.

548
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,346
Sleep couldn't hurt.

549
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:27,386
That's right.

550
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,496
I'll see you tomorrow.

551
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,116
Hey, did you come over
here just to check on me,

552
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,396
or did you need something?

553
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,566
It can keep till the morning.

554
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,490
I mean, I'm here now. What's up?

555
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,786
I just received a call
from San Quentin prison.

556
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:52,136
And apparently they
failed to grasp the urgency

557
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,276
of your request to put Austin Walker

558
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,316
into protective custody.

559
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,896
When they finally went to move him,

560
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,766
he was already dead.

561
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,186
Sorry, son.

562
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,886
That sounds like quite the first day back.

563
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,886
It was.

564
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,366
I mean, in some ways, I
feel really good about it.

565
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,746
You know, I didn't freeze,

566
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,026
and I handled every crazy
obstacle Tim threw at me.

567
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:28,546
But for the day to end like that...

568
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,756
When your watch commander told you

569
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,276
that man had been killed,

570
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,006
- how did you feel?
- Frustrated.

571
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,526
You realize that's the
exact word you used

572
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:36,246
yesterday after our
visualization exercise?

573
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:38,006
Well, it's frustrating, you know,

574
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,806
knowing I can be doing everything right

575
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,146
and things still go wrong.

576
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,466
Lack of control is scary,

577
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,396
especially when your job
involves so much violence.

578
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,396
Hey, when you start
to notice those feelings,

579
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,716
try focusing on the
things you can control.

580
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,996
Tyson is still in custody, and I can work

581
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,406
on connecting him to the murder,

582
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:59,136
but what I still don't get is,

583
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,446
if Stacy had until today to
pay the protection money,

584
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:05,206
why was her husband
murdered last night?

585
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,480
I did miss something.

586
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,286
So our victim had lots of enemies.

587
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,566
At first, Cheryl's neighbors
and coworkers were

588
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,396
a little hesitant to
speak ill of the dead, but

589
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,126
yeah, but once they got
going, they would not stop.

590
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,396
They would not stop.

591
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,226
That tracks with what we found online.

592
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,576
Her school's unofficial message
board has an entire subgroup

593
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,986
devoted to hating on her.

594
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,236
The most extreme
comments coming from a user

595
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,166
going by the handle grid iron gangsta.

596
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:37,136
We traced the account back
to this guy, Conrad bataglia.

597
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,966
No criminal history, but he
lives with his wife, justine,

598
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,696
a mile away from the park,

599
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,526
and he coaches football
at Cheryl's school.

600
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,976
So he's a gridiron something.

601
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,526
Let me give you a few highlights.

602
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,906
Um, "she deserves cancer."

603
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:53,846
"I fantasize about shoving
a stapler down her throat."

604
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,916
And "someone should
euthanize the bitch."

605
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,226
Yikes.

606
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,126
Yeah, so bring Conrad in.

607
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,916
People find it easier to
lie to officers in uniform,

608
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,336
so lock him into a statement

609
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,166
and pretend like you
believe everything he says.

610
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,336
In the meantime, we'll blow up

611
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,406
all his possible defenses and alibis.

612
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:10,516
You want us to mayberry it?

613
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,206
Not full-on Barney fife,

614
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,036
but don't let him know he's a suspect.

615
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,346
Roger.

616
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,006
Who's Barney fife?

617
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,176
Okay, every time you ask
me a question like that...

618
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,076
All I hear is, "you're old."

619
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,666
- Okay, I'm sorry, sir.
- No, but really, who is he?

620
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,356
- Hello?
- Officer Nolan?

621
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,776
- It's opal Jesper.
- Hi, Mrs. Jesper.

622
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,296
Can you tell the reporters
outside my house to leave?

623
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,466
No, I really can't.

624
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,156
But if they're trespassing, just call 911.

625
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,366
I have no privacy!

626
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,576
The police took my front door.

627
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,516
They probably thought there
was potential evidence on it.

628
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,996
- Well, that's ridiculous!
- What could they find?

629
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,166
Mrs. Jesper, look,

630
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,966
any questions about the investigation

631
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,176
should really be directed
to detective Harper

632
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,586
or detective Lopez.

633
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:52,456
Meanwhile, I advise you
stay with friends or relatives

634
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,106
until things settle down a little bit.

635
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,936
And now I hate to do
this, but I have to go.

636
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,496
I'm gonna rush you off, okay? All right?

637
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,116
- All right.
- Thank you.

638
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,700
Okay, let's go... where are we going?

639
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,786
Nolan, look.

640
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,486
Hello?

641
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:28,936
Mr. Bataglia?

642
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,936
Police!

643
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,356
Hello?

644
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,766
Control, 7-Adam-15.
We have an open door.

645
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,186
We're making entry to
the residence to clear it.

646
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,356
Mr. Bataglia!

647
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,676
Police department!

648
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,946
We're coming inside your house!

649
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,886
Go.

650
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,610
Clear!

651
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,826
Clear!

652
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,396
Clear!

653
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
Juarez!

654
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,466
The rest of the house is clear.

655
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:20,296
No sign of bataglia.

656
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,376
7-Adam-15, we have
a db at the residence.

657
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,376
Notify homicide, watch commander,

658
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,656
and issue a bolo for Conrad bataglia.

659
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,376
Thanks for coming back, Mrs. Walker,

660
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,696
but I just need a little more information

661
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,936
before I can charge anyone.

662
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,270
- Anything to help my husband.
- Okay.

663
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,736
Now, we're hoping to identify some

664
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,636
of Mr. Kalashnikov's associates.

665
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,736
I mean, he couldn't have
been conducting business

666
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,320
all by himself with both arms in a cast.

667
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,606
Um, during your dealings with him,

668
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,816
did you ever see any of these men?

669
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,816
Um... Him.

670
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,306
Yeah, it's him.

671
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:01,276
I-I-I-I think I've seen him before.

672
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,516
He's involved, and he scares me.

673
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,486
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

674
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,176
Listen, can you tell me what is going on?

675
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,696
I've called the prison multiple times.

676
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,316
No one will tell me anything about Austin.

677
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,796
I'm getting worried here.

678
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,146
Your husband's in isolation,
where no one can get to him.

679
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,016
They're moving him to a
different facility tomorrow,

680
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:19,450
where he'll be safe.

681
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,326
What a relief.

682
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,336
What a relief. Thank you, officers.

683
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,700
My god, thank you.

684
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,880
Hello?

685
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,996
Hello?

686
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,276
- Austin's alive!
- What?

687
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,516
They have him in isolation
so no one can get to him.

688
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,796
They're gonna move him tomorrow.

689
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,960
What the hell are you gonna do now?

690
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,386
- Hi.
- Stacy?

691
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,286
- Give me the phone.
- Wh... excuse me?

692
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,836
Stacy, are you there?

693
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,016
This is sergeant Bradford with the LAPD.

694
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,876
This whole conversation
is being recorded.

695
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,636
You want to save me some
time and tell me your name,

696
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,886
or are you gonna make me run a trace?

697
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,336
Wrong number.

698
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,886
Trace it is.

699
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,296
I don't... I don't understand
what's happening right now.

700
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,576
You're under arrest
for the murder for hire

701
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,756
of your husband.

702
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,786
- I don't understand.
- Look, we lied.

703
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,276
And I'm sorry to inform
you, your husband is dead.

704
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,306
He was killed last night in jail

705
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,656
by one of Tyson's cronies.

706
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,726
And, look, I couldn't see why you wanted

707
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,216
your husband dead until
I read his criminal history.

708
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,736
Again, no convictions,
but multiple phone calls

709
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,286
to your house for domestic violence.

710
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,946
Throw in a mistress
and a judge authorized

711
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,086
a tap on your phone.

712
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:28,496
And you just confirmed our suspicions.

713
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,606
Okay.

714
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,630
My goodness.

715
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,156
Judge just signed the
ramey warrant for Conrad.

716
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,506
Bolo's in the system.

717
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,306
Yeah, and we put his car in svs.

718
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,506
How was the wife found?

719
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,406
Kitchen floor, facing the west wall.

720
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,336
Multiple stab wounds,
weapon still outstanding.

721
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,276
Well, then what, wife
finds out hubby kills Cheryl

722
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,486
and then confronts him?

723
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,826
Hubby panics and kills
the wife to silence her.

724
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,006
He realizes what he's
done and goes on the run.

725
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,596
Desperate idiot's playbook.

726
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,456
There are no clear prints on
the doorknob, just smudges.

727
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,016
What's the time element
for when she died?

728
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,916
Go ahead. You got this.

729
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,466
Well, I mean, a body loses heat

730
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:07,846
at a rate of 1.5 degrees per hour.

731
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,746
Thermostat is at 68.

732
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,196
But the body of the victim wasn't

733
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,536
that cold when we found it.

734
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,366
So I would say about
an hour, 90 minutes tops.

735
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,886
She's right.

736
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,096
What about the canvass?

737
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,276
Not home, not home, all not home.

738
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,166
Home, but didn't see or hear anything.

739
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,616
Harper searched Conrad's social media

740
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,966
and emergency contacts.

741
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,936
And if Conrad is running,
he's gonna need help.

742
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,656
So here are his closest friends.

743
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,216
Start from the bottom
and work your way up.

744
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,626
All right, I'll get chen's help with this.

745
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,876
She'll take odds, we'll take evens.

746
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,216
Great.

747
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,276
Control, location nine is unoccupied.

748
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,546
Show me en route to
location number seven.

749
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,766
All right, location six, Jose Martinez,

750
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,346
his husband, Todd.

751
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:06,070
It should be right up
there... By that Toyota.

752
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,076
Did you see that?

753
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,016
Yeah, I saw bushes
move. Is that Conrad?

754
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,606
Control, we have a possible
at location six on brywood.

755
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:17,156
Adam-19 attach.

756
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,476
Conrad, I wanna see your hands.

757
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,856
7-Adam-15, code-6 on suspect bataglia,

758
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,996
2300 block brywood.

759
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,206
Don't move. Show me your hands!

760
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,966
We got a foot pursuit,
northbound brywood!

761
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,866
Come here. Get up.

762
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,316
- No, wait!
- Against the car!

763
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:43,286
Aah. No! Wait!

764
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,396
You don't understand!
He's trying to kill me!

765
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,226
Hands. Hands!

766
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:53,986
Are you hurt anywhere else?

767
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,786
Just my head and right here.

768
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,856
All right, take us through
what happened, slowly.

769
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,516
This man broke into
our house and tied us up.

770
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,996
And he made me watch while he killed

771
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,246
while he killed justine.

772
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,006
I don't know how I got away,

773
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,176
but I must have broke the restraints.

774
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,906
He tried to stop me,

775
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,256
but I got away, and I-I just kept running.

776
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,836
He's almost ready for transport.

777
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,536
11-79 was just reported

778
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,946
at 1025 south butter field drive.

779
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,606
That's opal's address.

780
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:29,886
Control, 7-Adam-15, you have
any more details on the 11-79?

781
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:31,926
There's a man trapped under
the homeowner's vehicle.

782
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,646
Fire and ra already en route.

783
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,886
Control, attach us to this.

784
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,546
Chen?

785
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,786
Yeah, what's up?

786
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:39,276
Would you escort
Conrad to the hospital?

787
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,616
- He's been mirandized.
- Yeah, of course.

788
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,376
Come on.

789
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,556
What just happened?

790
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,896
Something about the pentagram widow.

791
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,106
He'll be ready to go in five.

792
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,416
Are they looking for him?

793
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,626
The guy who killed my wife?

794
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,116
- Can you describe him?
- I don't know.

795
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:54,736
He was white, average
height, average weight.

796
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,046
He was... he was deranged.

797
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,436
Any idea why he targeted you?

798
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,226
Okay, look, I want to get this guy.

799
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,786
All right? Your wife deserves justice.

800
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,166
But white, average height, weight,

801
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:09,710
that's not gonna get him.

802
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,020
Does this have anything
to do with Cheryl budny?

803
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,806
Look, I-I didn't mean to kill her.

804
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:28,016
I was just so tired of her lies.

805
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,776
We were fighting, and I shoved her.

806
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,256
And I guess she hit her head.

807
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,056
All right, well, killing her
might have been an accident,

808
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,126
but carving a pentagram
into her stomach was not.

809
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,296
Why didn't you call the police?

810
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,886
I don't know. I-I-I was scared.

811
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,646
I-I-I knew you guys would see
the post that I made about her.

812
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,646
So I tried to make it look
like it was that pentagram guy

813
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,996
from the documentary.

814
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,136
But then today, I got a
text from Cheryl, and it said

815
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,066
that she wanted me to feel
the same pain that I caused.

816
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:53,036
It's on my phone. Look.

817
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,906
Aah!

818
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,646
Officers taking fire,
2300 block of brywood.

819
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,816
Shooter has a long gun.

820
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,026
23-31, we're 10-9-7 on brywood.

821
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,786
Go.

822
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,896
Ready?

823
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,346
I'm clear!

824
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,320
Go!

825
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,920
Go!

826
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,806
Nobody else down brywood!
He's got a clear shot.

827
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,876
Stay off brywood.

828
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,116
Anybody hurt?

829
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,116
We're okay.

830
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,736
Conrad's dead.

831
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,776
Medic took a shot in the leg.

832
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,606
- We can't let him escape.
- We gotta seal him off.

833
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,466
We can't get a unit behind him.

834
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,436
There's a fence. The
alley doesn't go through.

835
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,236
- Can't they just climb over?
- Shooter will pick 'em off

836
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,746
as soon as they climb up.

837
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,616
Can I get an airship to help
seal off brywood to the south?

838
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,066
Copy. Air 11 is en route.

839
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,546
Eta, less than three minutes.

840
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,926
He's gonna be gone by then.

841
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,276
I can get down the
alleyway and just cut him off.

842
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,386
No, way, that's a 40-yard open-field run.

843
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,176
Well, if his head pops up, just blow it off.

844
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,216
I'll be all right.

845
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,936
Just let me know when you're ready.

846
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,450
Come on.

847
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,746
Go.

848
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,686
She made it. Code-4.

849
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,616
And she doesn't want
to give up her position.

850
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,710
Smart girl.

851
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,086
Stop where you are! Stop right there!

852
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,496
Put your hands where I can see them.

853
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,916
Turn around and put
your hands in the air.

854
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
Put your hands in the air.

855
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:08,056
Do it now.

856
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,056
Get your hand off your weapon.

857
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,716
Stop where you are.

858
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,726
Stop. Stop where you are.

859
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,226
Shooter's down!

860
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,186
Code-4!

861
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,390
I need a medic! The shooter is down!

862
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,746
In a panic, the wife of the
alleged pentagram killer,

863
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,436
attempted to flee,

864
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,886
injuring a reporter in the process.

865
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,956
Of the original spree.

866
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,686
Our own Steve sahagan
was almost crushed

867
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,866
by the frantic widow. Steve?

868
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,696
Juarez, get on crowd
control. Get these people back.

869
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,316
Back, folks. Get out of the way.

870
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,386
Come on.

871
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,456
Everyone. I need
everyone to stand back!

872
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,310
This is a crime scene.

873
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,466
Opal, what happened?

874
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,776
I just wanted them to leave me alone.

875
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,336
I thought you were
gonna stay with friends.

876
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,786
What friends?

877
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,546
I tried calling.

878
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:23,716
None of them want
anything to do with me.

879
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:29,176
It's all gone... my life,
my friends, my home.

880
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,386
He took it all.

881
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,680
They can't blame you if you didn't know.

882
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,146
Opal, did you know?

883
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:42,226
That my husband of
42 years was a killer?

884
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,436
Of course not.

885
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:49,786
But there... there were
some... some things.

886
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:54,090
He'd give me jewelry that
I knew we couldn't afford.

887
00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,206
He liked me to wear it,
and then it would disappear.

888
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,960
And once I-I found.

889
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,936
I found a pair of ladies'
underwear in the car.

890
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,976
I threw them away, but I didn't ask.

891
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,496
I didn't want to know.

892
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,150
I didn't want to know.

893
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,066
Bailey.

894
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,276
Hey.

895
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,416
I can't leave you alone for a minute.

896
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,486
- I know.
- How's Carmichael? Is he okay?

897
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,866
Yeah, he's barely scratched.

898
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,076
He's going around telling everyone

899
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,216
that he was shot, though.

900
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,216
Well, technically, he's not wrong.

901
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,836
Lucy was an absolute
badass out there, though.

902
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,256
We're still waiting to
hear if the guy she shot's

903
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,256
gonna pull through.

904
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,606
Well, patrol found 87
guns at that guy's house.

905
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,326
Looks like he finally
found a reason to use 'em.

906
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,916
That's unbelievable.

907
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,086
How's the reporter?

908
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,056
In surgery. Opal crushed his leg.

909
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,026
What's gonna happen to her?

910
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,646
Well, about 50 reporters got
the whole thing on camera,

911
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,826
so there's not gonna be a lot
of wiggle room for the defense.

912
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:09,036
Yeah, the pentagram killer's last victims.

913
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,686
- Hey.
- Hey.

914
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,006
- Why are you here?
- The

915
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,796
the pentagram widow ran over a reporter.

916
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,580
Right, right.

917
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,626
I passed Tim's train test.

918
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,006
- Congrats.
- Yeah.

919
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,876
I knew you would.

920
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,426
Didn't you have to
get punched in the face

921
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,046
- or something to pass?
- I did.

922
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,676
I mean, she was only like 90 pounds,

923
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,466
but it still counts, you know.

924
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:32,296
Anyways, I came to
see if there's any news

925
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,196
on Lucy's shooting.

926
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,676
Not yet.

927
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,376
Do we know?

928
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,966
- Still waiting.
- Where is she?

929
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,346
All right.

930
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,156
They're over there, yeah.

931
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,266
Hey.

932
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,166
Are you hurt?

933
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,586
My god.

934
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,966
You didn't have to take my
hero suggestion so literally.

935
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:20,246
I don't feel like a hero at all.

936
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,726
Any news?

937
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,286
He's still in surgery right now.

938
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,806
What if he dies?

939
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:30,496
What if I killed that guy?

940
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,380
Then we'll deal with it.

941
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,706
Jeff budny made it through surgery.

942
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,196
They're taking him to the icu.

943
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,476
Wait, he's alive?

944
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,856
Now the da still needs your statement

945
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,096
for the shooting inquiry.

946
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,616
And should he die from his injuries

947
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,826
at a later time, the
investigation will resume.

948
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:53,556
But try not to worry about that right now.

949
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,936
Can the statement wait?

950
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,626
Yeah, tomorrow morning's fine.

951
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,720
Let's go.

952
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,666
Come on. Come on.

953
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,800
Let's go home.

954
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,400
Damn it.
