1
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:07,214
Celina, look out!

2
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:09,940
Officer down.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,047
Help him.

4
00:00:14,842 --> 00:00:17,766
Tell me what you're feeling.

5
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:19,009
Frustration.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,252
But not fear?

7
00:00:21,262 --> 00:00:24,393
No.

8
00:00:24,403 --> 00:00:26,499
Today was the first time
during this exercise

9
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:27,810
that your heart rate
didn't spike.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,709
You remained calm.

11
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,607
Why do you think that is?

12
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:32,988
Because I know

13
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:34,748
there's no way I could have
stopped what happened.

14
00:00:34,758 --> 00:00:36,405
That's right.
The men who ambushed you

15
00:00:36,415 --> 00:00:39,270
and Officer Juarez
rigged the game.

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,238
No matter which way you turned,
whether you split up

17
00:00:41,248 --> 00:00:43,274
or stayed together,
even if you called it in,

18
00:00:43,284 --> 00:00:44,931
none of that
would have made a difference

19
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:46,139
because they were ready.

20
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:47,830
One of you was gonna be shot
that night.

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,039
And who knows?

22
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,316
If you hadn't made
the decisions you did,

23
00:00:50,326 --> 00:00:52,559
maybe it would have been
Celina, instead of you.

24
00:00:52,569 --> 00:00:53,629
No, you're... you're right.

25
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:56,080
Um, I've been blaming myself.

26
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,634
Like, if I had been smarter,

27
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:00,050
I could have somehow avoided it.

28
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,511
But it was out of my control.

29
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:09,542
Congratulations,
Officer Thorsen.

30
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:10,853
In my professional opinion,

31
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,832
you are ready
to return to active duty.

32
00:01:19,389 --> 00:01:23,142
Oh, I'm just really excited
to get back to work.

33
00:01:23,152 --> 00:01:25,119
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:30,080
<i>♪ Whoa, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,874
<i>♪ I'm gonna win for you</i>

36
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:36,362
<i>♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪</i>

37
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:38,467
Look, I told you I'm fine.

38
00:01:38,477 --> 00:01:41,056
I'll just retake the
detective's exam in two years.

39
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,127
It's not a big deal.

40
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,715
You know,
every time a woman in my life

41
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:47,511
has said she was fine,
she most definitely was not.

42
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:50,169
I'm not gonna pretend like
I wasn't a little disappointed.

43
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,205
But I've made my peace with it.

44
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:54,311
Plus, I'm a professional.

45
00:01:54,321 --> 00:01:56,658
Unless you want me to be upset.
No, of course not.

46
00:01:56,668 --> 00:01:58,901
Hey, Lucy, I heard about
the detective exam.

47
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,800
- Tough break.
- Yes, thank you.

48
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,527
I'm fine.

49
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:05,080
Whenever Bailey says
she's fine like that,

50
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,748
I up my life insurance.

51
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,501
There he is.

52
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:14,020
Everyone drive safe out there.

53
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,711
Thorsen is back in the shop.

54
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:17,092
As always, Detective,

55
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:18,714
your unwavering support
means the world to me.

56
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,199
- Mm.
- Ah, don't fret.

57
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:22,062
In Harper speak, that's
practically an "I love you."

58
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:24,661
Bradford, got a minute?

59
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:28,172
Congrats on being cleared.

60
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:30,381
- Thanks.
- So any nerves?

61
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:31,796
Not really.

62
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:34,592
Um, I feel strong in mind,
body, and spirit.

63
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:36,491
- I'm ready.
- Thorsen's not ready.

64
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:38,355
What's the first thing
an officer returning

65
00:02:38,365 --> 00:02:39,770
from injury worries about?

66
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,081
Gettin' hurt again.

67
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:43,670
Especially after
a near-fatal like Thorsen's.

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,879
You afraid he's gonna go
turtle up when things get real?

69
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:47,329
I don't wanna wait to find out.

70
00:02:47,339 --> 00:02:49,642
In this business, we don't
have the luxury of do-overs.

71
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:51,091
So you want me
to take him out today

72
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:52,265
to get punched in the face.

73
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:55,406
Officially, I want you
to supervise his ability

74
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:58,927
to cope with stress,
both mental and physical.

75
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:01,895
You got it.

76
00:03:01,905 --> 00:03:04,208
Let's see how he does
against the TRAIN.

77
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,968
Thorsen, you're with me.

78
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,454
Metro needs a support officer.

79
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:10,224
Oh, um, yes, sir.

80
00:03:12,606 --> 00:03:14,322
Ooh.

81
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:17,024
You know what it means
to "turtle up," Thorsen?

82
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:20,224
I don't think so, sir.

83
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:21,294
It happens when
an officer returns

84
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:22,778
to the job after a trauma,

85
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:23,952
put under some kind of pressure,

86
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:25,712
usually physical,
for the first time.

87
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:27,335
Instead of falling back
on their training,

88
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:30,165
they shrink into a shell,
where they feel safe.

89
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:31,684
So you think
I'm gonna turtle up?

90
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:32,995
Maybe.

91
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,273
If you do, there are lots
of companies looking

92
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:36,206
for delivery guys
with a good driving record.

93
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,311
Well, actually,
my fallback career is gonna be

94
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:40,934
influencer/shoe designer.

95
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:42,591
But I-I see what you're saying.

96
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:45,318
Oh, so that's why
I'm riding with you.

97
00:03:45,328 --> 00:03:48,839
So I gotta pass, what, some
type of Tim test so I don't...

98
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,116
It's called the TRAIN.

99
00:03:50,126 --> 00:03:51,704
Stands for Tactical,
Responsive, Assertive,

100
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:54,224
Investigative, and Nerve.

101
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,364
And I'm gonna test you
on all five major functions

102
00:03:56,374 --> 00:03:57,710
in stress environments.

103
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,437
Evaluate, improvise,
adapt, and overcome.

104
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:02,784
You ready for this?

105
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:05,590
Bring it on.

106
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,930
So how did you like riding
with Sergeant Bradford?

107
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,621
It was very educational.

108
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:15,693
Both he and Detective Harper
have very distinctive styles.

109
00:04:15,703 --> 00:04:18,178
Dispatch, you said the RP was
on the south side of the park?

110
00:04:18,188 --> 00:04:20,802
<i>Affirmative, 7-Adam-15.</i>

111
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:23,598
Okay, so did they, uh, like,
say anything about me?

112
00:04:23,608 --> 00:04:25,082
They did.

113
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:28,844
Like all rookies,
you are a work in progress.

114
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:30,950
Over here!

115
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,296
Hi, I'm Officer Nolan.

116
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,573
This is Officer Juarez.

117
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,781
You called about a body?

118
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,335
Yeah, it's, uh, in there.

119
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:37,612
Um, someone jammed the lock,

120
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:40,649
but when I finally got it open,
she...

121
00:04:40,659 --> 00:04:41,754
she was just lying there...

122
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:43,238
It's okay. It's okay.
Stay here.

123
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,964
We're gonna need to get some
information from you, okay?

124
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:46,044
Okay?

125
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,571
- After you.
- Yep.

126
00:05:10,793 --> 00:05:12,302
Oh.

127
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,166
Overdose?

128
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:16,375
No.

129
00:05:16,385 --> 00:05:17,721
Lividity in the cheeks.

130
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:21,414
She died facedown
and was moved here.

131
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:23,347
Looks like a homicide.
Let's call it in.

132
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,349
Control, requesting detectives

133
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:28,086
for a possible homicide.

134
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,150
Welcome to your first test.

135
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,014
Let me guess...
that's the stress environment?

136
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:36,326
Ah, it's a little more
than that.

137
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,846
Man inside is
Tyson Kalashnikov, 6'4", 275.

138
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:41,779
Has a warrant
for a missed court appearance.

139
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:43,747
Last time he was arrested,
he broke the cop's nose.

140
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:45,921
I assume calling
for backup is cheating?

141
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:49,072
Train's leaving,
Officer Thorsen.

142
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:52,524
Okay, let's do this.

143
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:00,142
Police! Open up!

144
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,258
It's open.

145
00:06:20,518 --> 00:06:21,681
Clear!

146
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:23,624
Tyson, show yourself!

147
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,325
Could one of you get me a beer?

148
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,079
I moved the picnic blanket
so we could examine her head.

149
00:06:40,089 --> 00:06:42,081
She was definitely
moved postmortem.

150
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:45,543
Obvious blunt force trauma
to the head.

151
00:06:46,475 --> 00:06:48,235
What's this under her shirt?

152
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,367
Huh, what is that?

153
00:06:52,377 --> 00:06:55,622
It's the signature
of the Pentagram Killer.

154
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,239
Pardon us just one moment.

155
00:07:02,249 --> 00:07:03,689
So the Pentagram Killer
is wanted

156
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:06,519
in connection to a string
of unsolved homicides

157
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:07,727
in the early 2000s.

158
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:09,729
His victims were all
middle-aged females.

159
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:11,006
He'd carve a pentagram

160
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:13,112
into their midsections
after he killed them.

161
00:07:13,122 --> 00:07:15,079
Then in 2009, he just stopped.

162
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:17,496
Hulu just dropped
a docuseries on him.

163
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:19,532
Maybe the renewed notoriety
inspired him

164
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,533
to come out of retirement.

165
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:21,741
The hysteria was real.

166
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:23,018
I was away at college,

167
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:25,400
and I made my brothers
escort my mom everywhere.

168
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,195
Mm, scary that they never
caught the guy.

169
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:29,439
Well, the city threw
everything they had at it,

170
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,475
multiple agencies working 24/7.

171
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:33,581
My first sergeant was
on the task force.

172
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:36,031
Oh, speaking of,
whenever we respond

173
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,068
to a potentially
high-profile event,

174
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:39,587
it's important
to notify the watch commander.

175
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:42,521
Yes, sir.

176
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:46,283
Adam-200, be advised, our DB
might be a possible victim

177
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:47,595
of the Pentagram Killer.

178
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:49,469
Officer Juarez!

179
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,254
Did I do something wrong?

180
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,877
As her TO, that is on you.

181
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:55,223
Yes, ma'am.
I am sorry, ma'am.

182
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:57,259
Officer Suarez,
I should have been clearer.

183
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,261
You never give out that kind
of sensitive information

184
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,470
over the radio.

185
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,402
Now every news organization
or hobbyist

186
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:04,059
with a scanner has it.

187
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,336
Oh, my God.
I didn't think that...

188
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:06,406
Uh, did I hear someone say

189
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,442
"Pentagram Killer" on the radio?

190
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:09,099
- Um...
- I'm... I'm so sorry.

191
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:10,997
Is that really bad?

192
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,413
Cases like this capture
the public's attention.

193
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:15,899
People call in with tips,
trying to be a part of it.

194
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,659
But most of them are
a complete waste of time.

195
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:19,178
Yeah, because when people panic,

196
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:20,904
they call 911
at every bump in the night.

197
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:23,147
So no, that...
that was not ideal.

198
00:08:23,157 --> 00:08:25,425
Okay, is there anything
I can do to help?

199
00:08:25,435 --> 00:08:27,082
Just take the witness back
to the station,

200
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:28,498
and maybe stay off the radio.

201
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,947
Yes, ma'am.
We're on it.

202
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,431
- I'm sorry.
- Mm.

203
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:33,202
Come on.

204
00:08:35,204 --> 00:08:36,506
You want me to start canvassing?

205
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,922
Uh, no, we need
to secure the perimeter first.

206
00:08:38,932 --> 00:08:42,270
Um, there's no one watching
the northwest corner.

207
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,732
Probably because it's where
the hell dumpsters are.

208
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,001
Yeah, of course.
Whatever you need.

209
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,693
As a patrol officer, I'm here
to support your investigation

210
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:53,039
- in any way that I can.
- Great.

211
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:54,351
We're gonna head back
to the station

212
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:55,801
and dig into this case file

213
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:59,677
and let crime scene
do their thing.

214
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,233
Come here.

215
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:15,890
Got it?

216
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,064
Yo, just lean him up
against the car.

217
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:21,422
Control, Bradford, can I get a
transport van to our location?

218
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,795
What's that?

219
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,393
No idea.

220
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:29,351
I'll check it out.

221
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,466
Tyson?

222
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,529
Tyson? It's me.

223
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:35,599
Hi.

224
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,843
You looking for Tyson?

225
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:41,363
- Have you heard the good news?
- What good news?

226
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,434
Our lord and savior has come
to save our souls.

227
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,229
Well, amen, sister.

228
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:48,992
- Ha.
- Can I see some ID?

229
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,580
Ma'am?

230
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,385
Excuse me. Ma'am.

231
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,089
No!

232
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:32,000
Hey, Harper, uh,
I just found a pile of vomit

233
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,795
on the far northwest corner
of the park.

234
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:35,417
Oh, lucky you.

235
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,627
It's unlikely to be related,

236
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,836
but we still need
to collect it, just in case.

237
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:41,354
I will have TID process it

238
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:42,701
as soon as they're done
with the scene.

239
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:45,358
Oh, um, how long
do you think that'll take?

240
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:47,878
Uh, a couple hours, four tops.

241
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:49,708
In the meantime,
keep an eye on it.

242
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:52,814
It's my lucky...

243
00:10:52,824 --> 00:10:55,102
It's my lucky day.

244
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:00,373
- I wouldn't want to be her.
- Ooh.

245
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:03,722
Man, that man is
an Olympic-level yeller.

246
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,585
You got an ID on our vic?

247
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:09,659
Yeah, Cheryl Budny, 42,
works at Lincoln Junior High.

248
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,971
She left at her usual time
around 5:00 p.m...

249
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:13,076
didn't show up today.

250
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:14,456
She live close by the park?

251
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,113
No, Culver City.

252
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:17,425
So that means that the dump site

253
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:19,323
is most likely related
to the killer.

254
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:21,878
Yeah, Cheryl's brother lives
over in Little Armenia.

255
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:22,982
He should be here any minute.

256
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:24,328
I reserved interview three
for us.

257
00:11:24,338 --> 00:11:25,788
Great.

258
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:28,747
You still have
all your fingers and toes?

259
00:11:28,757 --> 00:11:30,369
Sergeant Grey was very fair.

260
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:32,474
And again, I'm...
I'm very sorry.

261
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,717
Don't worry about us.

262
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,029
It's you guys
who are gonna pay the price.

263
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:36,375
What do you mean?

264
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:37,721
Any more evidence pointing
to the Pentagram Killer?

265
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,447
Some of the signature
qualities match

266
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:42,450
his previous victims,
but all are public knowledge.

267
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,728
Which means we can't
decisively say it's him.

268
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,523
Nolan, I need you guys 10-8.

269
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:47,627
Calls are backing up.

270
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:50,078
26 pending related
to the Pentagram.

271
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:51,977
And that's the price.

272
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:54,013
Cheryl's next of kin
is on his way.

273
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:56,153
Call us if you get
anything interesting.

274
00:11:56,163 --> 00:11:58,441
Phone call. On the phone.

275
00:12:03,584 --> 00:12:06,025
All right, what have we got,
Officer Thorsen?

276
00:12:06,035 --> 00:12:07,509
Well, she attempted to contact

277
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,857
a well-known criminal
and one suspect.

278
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,962
She ran when she saw
my uniform, giving me

279
00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:13,723
probable cause to believe
that she also was engaged

280
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,862
in criminal activity.

281
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:17,657
And she also held $15,000
in cash.

282
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,730
And cash is frequently used

283
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,939
to finance and conceal
criminal activity.

284
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:25,286
Not bad.

285
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,632
Is that enough to arrest?

286
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:28,220
I mean, she tried
to scratch my face off.

287
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,773
So there's a 1-48 right there.

288
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,395
But I'm actually more interested

289
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:32,776
in why she had all that money
on her.

290
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,641
Good. Under stress,
you made a tactical entry.

291
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:37,539
You were responsive
to criminal activity

292
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,920
and assertive when
she tried to run.

293
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:40,794
You may build
this TRAIN just yet.

294
00:12:42,831 --> 00:12:43,891
Well, what about "nerve"?

295
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:44,892
I mean, she hit me with her bag,

296
00:12:44,902 --> 00:12:45,893
and did you see her nails?

297
00:12:45,903 --> 00:12:46,963
Nope.

298
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:47,998
Hurry up and process 'em.

299
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:50,355
We got work to do.

300
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,210
Jeff Budny?

301
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,729
I'm Detective Lopez.

302
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:55,903
This is Detective Harper.

303
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:57,145
If you follow us,
we have a room set up.

304
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:59,492
I got 30 minutes left
on my lunch break.

305
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:02,081
Can't you just say whatever it
is you need to say right here?

306
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:04,566
Uh, well, we're sorry
to have to tell you this,

307
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,568
but it's about
your sister, Cheryl.

308
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,225
What about her?

309
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:09,996
She's deceased.

310
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:15,025
What?

311
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:16,233
What happened?

312
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:18,339
It was a homicide.

313
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:19,996
- I'm so sorry.
- A homicide?

314
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:21,066
Wait, wait, wait.

315
00:13:21,076 --> 00:13:24,034
That's... when? How?

316
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:25,795
Listen,
I know this is difficult,

317
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,038
but we really would like
to speak with you somewhere

318
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,557
where there's more privacy.

319
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:30,903
Just tell me what happened
to my sister.

320
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:33,561
They discovered her body
in a park this morning.

321
00:13:33,571 --> 00:13:34,873
And that's really all
we can say right now.

322
00:13:34,883 --> 00:13:36,219
That's all you can say?

323
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:38,221
Did you two get along?

324
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:40,982
I mean, when was the last time
you saw or spoke with her?

325
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:43,053
We were tight, all right?
I don't know.

326
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,123
I talked to her
a couple days ago.

327
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,780
Wednesday, maybe.
I don't know.

328
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,541
Can you think of anyone
who wanted to harm her?

329
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:50,854
No.

330
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,373
She worked at a grade school.

331
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:54,824
Well, I'm sorry,
but I have to ask,

332
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,101
what were you doing last night?

333
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:57,447
You mean while
my sister was being murdered?

334
00:13:57,457 --> 00:14:00,588
Yeah, watching
the Laker game at Barney's.

335
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:02,107
20 people can vouch for me.

336
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:05,455
Listen, I know you're upset,
and I cannot even imagine

337
00:14:05,465 --> 00:14:06,801
what you are going through
right now.

338
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:08,699
But the more you give us,

339
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:10,287
the faster
we can find who did this.

340
00:14:10,297 --> 00:14:11,737
I can't do this right now, okay?

341
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:13,118
There's people I need to call.

342
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:15,258
My mom, jeez.
I gotta call my mom.

343
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:16,742
We understand,
but as soon as possible,

344
00:14:16,752 --> 00:14:18,951
we need to sit down with you
and get a full statement.

345
00:14:18,961 --> 00:14:19,987
Call us when you're ready.

346
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:22,240
Any time, day or night.

347
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,786
Well, he seems genuinely upset.

348
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:29,134
Yeah, still gonna check
that alibi, though.

349
00:14:29,144 --> 00:14:30,445
Damn straight.

350
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:33,517
All right, Sarge,
both suspects are booked.

351
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:34,967
Do you want a medal?

352
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:36,072
No, sir.

353
00:14:36,082 --> 00:14:37,556
I just really would like
to figure out

354
00:14:37,566 --> 00:14:39,592
what a suburban housewife
was doing with all that cash.

355
00:14:39,602 --> 00:14:40,835
And why bring it to Tyson?

356
00:14:40,845 --> 00:14:42,802
Opioids, gambling,
debt, pirated movies.

357
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:44,080
Who knows?
Who cares?

358
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,495
They never completed
the transaction.

359
00:14:45,505 --> 00:14:46,979
If there's more to it,

360
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:48,153
shouldn't we dig
a little deeper?

361
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:50,017
Good.

362
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,916
The I in TRAIN stands
for Investigative Initiative.

363
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,262
That's two I's.

364
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:55,919
Never mind.

365
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,783
You don't get the I
unless it's under stress.

366
00:14:57,793 --> 00:15:00,924
So we're gonna make
this interesting.

367
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,719
You've got nine minutes

368
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:04,100
to get to the bottom of this.

369
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,067
If you can't,
I'm gonna recommend we extend

370
00:15:06,077 --> 00:15:08,104
your probation and return you
to the FTO program.

371
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:11,107
Nine minutes? Why not ten?

372
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:12,936
Now it's eight minutes,
47 seconds.

373
00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:14,741
Ticktock.

374
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:20,910
So why were you attempting
to pay Tyson Kalashnikov

375
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,635
$15,000 in cash?

376
00:15:22,645 --> 00:15:24,327
'Cause he's my gigolo.

377
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,501
I got a thing for guys
who can't move their arms.

378
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:28,538
Mm-hmm.

379
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:29,988
Hello?

380
00:15:29,998 --> 00:15:32,922
Yes, arm casts.
Very sexy.

381
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,545
Oh, your husband's in prison.

382
00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:38,582
I mean, your husband
is Austin Walker,

383
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:40,412
doing three to five
in San Quentin

384
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:41,585
for embezzlement.

385
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:43,829
- Is that right?
- Austin made a mistake.

386
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,693
Yeah, one with very serious
consequences.

387
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:47,867
Now, did you know

388
00:15:47,877 --> 00:15:51,250
that Tyson did four stints
in San Quentin?

389
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,080
<i>And that's where
he's heading back to now.</i>

390
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,358
And it looks like
he's also the lieutenant

391
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:58,568
of the Devil's Crown
prison gang.

392
00:15:58,578 --> 00:15:59,845
They run your husband's prison.

393
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:02,330
Okay, so connecting those dots,

394
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,746
I'm guessing that you paid Tyson

395
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,990
to keep your husband safe
while he's inside.

396
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,002
Is that what's happening?

397
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:15,240
Tyson said that if I didn't pay
him the money by tomorrow,

398
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,966
Austin was as good as dead.

399
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,658
He's all I have.
I didn't have a choice.

400
00:16:19,668 --> 00:16:21,453
I didn't... I didn't know
what else to do.

401
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,041
Okay, look, don't worry.

402
00:16:23,051 --> 00:16:25,743
All right?
I'm gonna help you.

403
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:31,359
Sir, I need to call the prison
and have Austin Walker put

404
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:32,947
into protective custody,
like, right now.

405
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:36,054
Already done,
and you still have 25 seconds.

406
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:38,366
Are you sure
your investigation is complete?

407
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:39,678
Yeah, I think so.

408
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:41,921
I mean, it's just
a classic protection racket.

409
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,716
Are you asking me,
or are you telling me?

410
00:16:43,726 --> 00:16:44,890
No, I'm telling...
I'm telling you.

411
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,925
Okay.

412
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:47,962
Unless I'm missing something.

413
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:49,042
I didn't say that.

414
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:51,665
Time's up.

415
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,107
<i>Ooh, listen to this one.</i>

416
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:56,695
<i>A man says
that his neighbor's cat</i>

417
00:16:56,705 --> 00:16:58,766
is possessed by the Pentagram.

418
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:01,424
There's gotta be one tip
on that call line

419
00:17:01,434 --> 00:17:03,322
that is not totally insane.

420
00:17:03,332 --> 00:17:04,737
Uh, let's see.

421
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,981
A lady with
a devil-worshipping nephew.

422
00:17:06,991 --> 00:17:08,914
- Skip it.
- Teenage girl thought

423
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:10,674
that her mailman was
the Pentagram

424
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:12,400
and was there to snatch her.

425
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,161
Oh, she actually sprayed him
with a hose.

426
00:17:14,171 --> 00:17:16,059
- Next.
- Old lady claims her husband

427
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,993
committed the murders
while he was on shore leave.

428
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:20,132
Was he in the Navy?

429
00:17:20,142 --> 00:17:21,858
It looks like
commercial fisherman.

430
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:23,894
- Attach us to that.
- Really?

431
00:17:23,904 --> 00:17:25,344
Commercial fisherman work
a lot at night...

432
00:17:25,354 --> 00:17:27,622
perfect excuse to be out late, hunting.

433
00:17:27,632 --> 00:17:30,453
All of our victims had ligature
marks from being tied up.

434
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:32,627
You know who's really good
at tying knots?

435
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:34,812
- Fishermen?
- Bingo.

436
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,294
Mrs. Opal Jesper?

437
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:46,237
We're here about
a tip you called in.

438
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,747
I'm... I'm sorry.

439
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:50,818
I shouldn't have done that.
It was a mistake.

440
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:53,027
Ma'am...

441
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:55,374
you said your husband
is the Pentagram Killer.

442
00:17:55,384 --> 00:17:57,628
That does not sound
like a mistake.

443
00:18:00,182 --> 00:18:02,219
I didn't know what to do.

444
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,094
I found this.

445
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:20,261
Sandra Owens.

446
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:22,894
That's the first victim.

447
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:27,554
Ma'am, where is
your husband right now?

448
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,284
He's been dead for seven years.

449
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,775
Probably more inside.
Thanks very much.

450
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:46,839
Thanks.

451
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,531
What's gonna happen to me?

452
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:49,877
Well, the detectives
are gonna have

453
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:51,672
a few more questions for you
back at the station.

454
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:52,776
At the station?

455
00:18:52,786 --> 00:18:54,537
- Will you be there?
- No, ma'am.

456
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:56,401
I'm a patrol officer,
not an investigator.

457
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:57,609
Oh.

458
00:18:57,619 --> 00:19:00,439
Um, I'll tell you what.

459
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:01,613
Why don't you take my card?

460
00:19:01,623 --> 00:19:03,270
If you need anything,
give me a call.

461
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,168
My mobile number's on there,
all right?

462
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:06,618
If you'll excuse us
just for a moment?

463
00:19:06,628 --> 00:19:08,457
Thanks.

464
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:12,658
Hey.

465
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:14,833
That widow looks like
she's sweet on you.

466
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:16,248
Yeah, Nolan gave her his number.

467
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:18,285
Yes, I was trying
to build rapport.

468
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:19,769
- Did it work?
- Hard to say.

469
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:21,253
She insists she didn't know
anything about the murders

470
00:19:21,263 --> 00:19:23,635
until after her husband died
and she found the trophies.

471
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,188
I mean, how could
she not have known?

472
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,466
Well, her husband wasn't
on the original suspect list,

473
00:19:27,476 --> 00:19:29,779
which means that he was good
at flying under the radar.

474
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,608
Well, at least we can
eliminate the Pentagram Killer

475
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:33,300
as a suspect
in Cheryl Budny's case.

476
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,336
Let's hope his copycat
isn't as skilled

477
00:19:35,346 --> 00:19:36,820
at covering his tracks.

478
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,236
Nolan, Juarez.

479
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:39,858
So I understand
you took the call.

480
00:19:39,868 --> 00:19:41,170
Yes, sir.
We got lucky.

481
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,930
Well, actually,
Officer Nolan picked it out.

482
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,208
- He thought it sounded credible.
- Nice catch.

483
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47,314
Look, the mayor asked me
to give a press conference

484
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:50,109
announcing the identity
of the Pentagram Killer.

485
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:52,802
I'd like you two to be there
so I can recognize your work.

486
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:54,459
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

487
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:56,609
All right, go get cleaned up.
You're gonna be on TV.

488
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:00,672
Do you think I have time
for a blowout?

489
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:01,949
Absolutely not.

490
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:03,443
- No?
- Come on.

491
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:11,890
You ready?

492
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,132
Yeah.

493
00:20:13,142 --> 00:20:15,825
Let's go.

494
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:17,216
Is that the widow?

495
00:20:18,769 --> 00:20:20,219
It must be.

496
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,040
You know, I almost attached
to that call.

497
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:27,354
But I got pulled to a 2-11 that
turned out to be a false alarm.

498
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:28,907
Then you'd be the one on TV,

499
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:31,012
and Primm would have realized
what a giant mistake he made

500
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,256
torpedoing
your detective's exam.

501
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,293
Yeah, something like that.

502
00:20:35,303 --> 00:20:38,917
Instead, I spent the day
breathing in hot dumpster fumes

503
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:41,747
while standing guard
over a pile of puke

504
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:43,197
for three hours
on the off chance

505
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,405
it belonged to our killer.

506
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,820
- Did it?
- Nope.

507
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,028
It was a sick dog.

508
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,616
Okay, so you had a crappy day.

509
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:50,653
You've had 'em before,
and you'll have 'em again.

510
00:20:50,663 --> 00:20:52,275
The best part about
being on patrol is

511
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,932
you never know
what's gonna happen.

512
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:55,934
Maybe tomorrow,
you'll be the big hero.

513
00:20:55,944 --> 00:20:57,453
I would just settle
for not having to deal

514
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:59,006
with any bodily fluids.

515
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:00,776
Yeah, don't be too greedy.

516
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:06,358
So do you really believe
the widow had no idea?

517
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:09,361
I don't know.
I mean, there was a time

518
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:12,226
when I couldn't have conceived
of not being able to tell

519
00:21:12,236 --> 00:21:15,402
that my partner was keeping
something from me, but...

520
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:17,714
Then I went and hid
a whole husband from you.

521
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:18,888
Yeah, pretty much.
But you know what?

522
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:20,924
Getting through that
made us stronger.

523
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:22,409
- Yeah.
- What about you?

524
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:24,031
Do you think if you found out
I was a murderer

525
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:25,032
would you turn me in?

526
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:26,447
Absolutely.

527
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:27,931
Not a moment's hesitation.

528
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:30,209
I think you should be more
worried if I did hesitate.

529
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:31,521
- Yeah.
- What about you?

530
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:34,144
Well, as a cop,
it'd be my duty to arrest you.

531
00:21:34,154 --> 00:21:36,077
But I have to say,
I would be pretty handy

532
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,355
at helping you hide a body.

533
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:39,046
So romantic.

534
00:21:39,056 --> 00:21:41,921
I know, right?

535
00:21:46,063 --> 00:21:47,054
Hey.

536
00:21:47,064 --> 00:21:49,090
How'd today go?

537
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,231
Uh, good, I think.

538
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:53,819
Sergeant Bradford said
something to me today

539
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:55,649
that made me think I need
to dig deeper on our case,

540
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:59,653
but you ever read something
ten times

541
00:21:59,663 --> 00:22:01,862
and still feel like
you're missing the point of it?

542
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:04,761
Performing under pressure
takes many forms.

543
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:07,799
Sometimes physical,
so you feel nervous.

544
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:09,801
Other times, mental.

545
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:11,803
And you just can't see
the forest from the trees.

546
00:22:11,813 --> 00:22:13,322
Yeah, well,
all I can see is trees.

547
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,806
So any advice?

548
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:16,152
Yeah, stop thinking about it.

549
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:17,256
Take a walk.

550
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:18,292
Take a shower.

551
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:20,087
Turn your brain off.

552
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:22,434
Let your mind find the answer.

553
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:23,918
In other words, go home.

554
00:22:23,928 --> 00:22:25,334
Yes, sir.

555
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,335
Sleep couldn't hurt.

556
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,370
That's right.

557
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,476
I'll see you tomorrow.

558
00:22:29,486 --> 00:22:32,099
Hey, uh, did you come over
here just to check on me,

559
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:33,376
or did you need something?

560
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:35,551
It can keep till the morning.

561
00:22:35,561 --> 00:22:37,494
I mean, I'm here now.
What's up?

562
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:48,771
I just received a call
from San Quentin Prison.

563
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:52,119
And apparently they failed
to grasp the urgency

564
00:22:52,129 --> 00:22:54,259
of your request
to put Austin Walker

565
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:56,295
into protective custody.

566
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:57,883
When they finally went
to move him,

567
00:22:57,893 --> 00:22:59,757
he was already dead.

568
00:23:02,484 --> 00:23:05,176
Sorry, son.

569
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:15,867
That sounds like
quite the first day back.

570
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:16,868
It was.

571
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:18,525
I mean, in some ways,

572
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:20,354
I feel really good about it.

573
00:23:20,364 --> 00:23:21,735
You know, I didn't freeze,

574
00:23:21,745 --> 00:23:25,014
and I handled every crazy
obstacle Tim threw at me.

575
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:28,535
But for the day
to end like that...

576
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:29,743
When your watch commander
told you

577
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,261
that man had been killed,

578
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:32,987
- how did you feel?
- Frustrated.

579
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:34,506
You realize that's
the exact word you used

580
00:23:34,516 --> 00:23:36,232
yesterday after
our visualization exercise?

581
00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:37,992
Well, it's frustrating,
you know,

582
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,787
knowing I can be doing
everything right

583
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:41,133
and things still go wrong.

584
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:42,445
Lack of control is scary,

585
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:45,379
especially when your job
involves so much violence.

586
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:48,382
Hey, when you start
to notice those feelings,

587
00:23:48,392 --> 00:23:51,706
try focusing on the things
you can control.

588
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,976
Tyson is still in custody,
and I can work

589
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:57,391
on connecting him to the murder,

590
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:59,117
but what I still don't get is,

591
00:23:59,127 --> 00:24:02,431
if Stacy had until today
to pay the protection money,

592
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,202
why was her husband murdered
last night?

593
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,483
I did miss something.

594
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:16,272
So our victim had
lots of enemies.

595
00:24:16,282 --> 00:24:18,550
At first, Cheryl's neighbors
and coworkers were

596
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,379
a little hesitant to speak ill
of the dead, but...

597
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:22,105
Yeah, but once they got
going, they would not stop.

598
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:23,382
They would not stop.

599
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:25,212
That tracks with
what we found online.

600
00:24:25,222 --> 00:24:27,559
Her school's unofficial message
board has an entire subgroup

601
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:28,974
devoted to hating on her.

602
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:31,218
The most extreme comments
coming from a user

603
00:24:31,228 --> 00:24:34,152
going by the handle
GridironGangsta.

604
00:24:34,162 --> 00:24:37,120
We traced the account back
to this guy, Conrad Bataglia.

605
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,951
No criminal history, but he
lives with his wife, Justine,

606
00:24:39,961 --> 00:24:41,677
a mile away from the park,

607
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:44,507
and he coaches football
at Cheryl's school.

608
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:45,957
So he's a gridiron something.

609
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,510
Let me give you
a few highlights.

610
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,892
Um, "She deserves cancer."

611
00:24:49,902 --> 00:24:53,827
"I fantasize about shoving
a stapler down her throat."

612
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:56,899
And "Someone should
euthanize the bitch."

613
00:24:56,909 --> 00:24:58,210
Yikes.

614
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,109
Yeah, so bring Conrad in.

615
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,905
People find it easier to lie
to officers in uniform,

616
00:25:02,915 --> 00:25:04,320
so lock him into a statement

617
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,149
and pretend like you believe
everything he says.

618
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,323
In the meantime, we'll blow up

619
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,394
all his possible defenses
and alibis.

620
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:10,499
You want us to Mayberry it?

621
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,190
Not full-on Barney Fife,

622
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,019
but don't let him know
he's a suspect.

623
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:16,332
Roger.

624
00:25:16,342 --> 00:25:17,989
Who's Barney Fife?

625
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:20,163
Okay, every time you ask me
a question like that...

626
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:22,062
All I hear is, "You're old."

627
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,651
Okay, I'm sorry, sir.
No, but really, who is he?

628
00:25:24,661 --> 00:25:26,342
- Hello?
<i>- Officer Nolan?</i>

629
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:28,758
<i>- It's Opal Jesper.</i>
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Jesper.

630
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:31,278
<i>Can you tell the reporters
outside my house to leave?</i>

631
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:34,453
Oh, uh, no, I really can't.

632
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:36,145
But if they're trespassing,
just call 911.

633
00:25:36,155 --> 00:25:37,353
<i>I have no privacy!</i>

634
00:25:37,363 --> 00:25:39,562
<i>- The police took my front door.</i>
- Oh.

635
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:41,495
They probably thought there was
potential evidence on it.

636
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:42,979
<i>Well, that's ridiculous!
What could they find?</i>

637
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:44,153
Mrs. Jesper, look,

638
00:25:44,163 --> 00:25:45,948
any questions about
the investigation

639
00:25:45,958 --> 00:25:48,157
should really be directed
to Detective Harper

640
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:49,572
or Detective Lopez.

641
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:52,437
Meanwhile, I advise you stay
with friends or relatives

642
00:25:52,447 --> 00:25:54,094
until things settle down
a little bit.

643
00:25:54,104 --> 00:25:55,923
And now I hate to do this,
but I have to go.

644
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:57,476
I'm gonna rush you off, okay?
All right?

645
00:25:57,486 --> 00:25:59,099
<i>- All right.</i>
- Thank you.

646
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:02,481
Okay, let's go...

647
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:03,700
where are we going?

648
00:26:14,814 --> 00:26:17,783
Nolan, look.

649
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:26,471
Hello?

650
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:28,922
Mr. Bataglia?

651
00:26:28,932 --> 00:26:29,923
Police!

652
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:31,338
Hello?

653
00:26:31,348 --> 00:26:33,754
Control, 7-Adam-15.
We have an open door.

654
00:26:33,764 --> 00:26:36,170
We're making entry
to the residence to clear it.

655
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,344
Mr. Bataglia!

656
00:26:37,354 --> 00:26:38,656
Police department!

657
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:41,945
We're coming inside your house!

658
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:48,883
Go.

659
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:56,615
Clear!

660
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,825
<i>Clear!</i>

661
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:11,378
Clear!

662
00:27:11,388 --> 00:27:12,389
Juarez!

663
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:18,454
The rest of the house is clear.

664
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:20,293
No sign of Bataglia.

665
00:27:22,088 --> 00:27:24,356
7-Adam-15, we have a DB
at the residence.

666
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,358
Notify Homicide,
watch commander,

667
00:27:26,368 --> 00:27:29,638
and issue a BOLO
for Conrad Bataglia.

668
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,363
Thanks for coming back,
Mrs. Walker,

669
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:32,675
but I just need
a little more information

670
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:33,918
before I can charge anyone.

671
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:36,275
- Anything to help my husband.
- Okay.

672
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:40,718
Now, we're hoping
to identify some

673
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:43,617
of Mr. Kalashnikov's
associates.

674
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:44,722
I mean, he couldn't have
been conducting business

675
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:47,320
all by himself
with both arms in a cast.

676
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:51,590
Um, during your dealings
with him,

677
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,800
did you ever see
any of these men?

678
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:56,768
Um...

679
00:27:56,778 --> 00:27:57,804
him.

680
00:27:57,814 --> 00:27:59,288
Yeah, it's him.

681
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:01,255
Uh, I-I-I-I think
I've seen him before.

682
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,499
He's involved, and he scares me.

683
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:04,811
Hm.

684
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:06,467
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

685
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,159
Listen, can you tell me
what is going on?

686
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:09,678
I've called the prison
multiple times.

687
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,300
No one will tell me
anything about Austin.

688
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,784
I'm getting worried here.

689
00:28:12,794 --> 00:28:15,131
Your husband's in isolation,
where no one can get to him.

690
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:16,995
They're moving him to
a different facility tomorrow,

691
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:19,456
where he'll be safe.

692
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:23,322
What a relief.

693
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:27,316
Whew, what a relief.
Thank you, officers.

694
00:28:27,326 --> 00:28:28,707
My God, thank you.

695
00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:34,885
<i>Hello?</i>

696
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:37,982
<i>Hello?</i>

697
00:28:37,992 --> 00:28:40,260
- Austin's alive!
<i>- What?</i>

698
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,503
They have him in isolation
so no one can get to him.

699
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,781
They're gonna move him tomorrow.

700
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,965
What the hell
are you gonna do now?

701
00:28:47,898 --> 00:28:49,372
- Hi.
<i>- Stacy?</i>

702
00:28:49,382 --> 00:28:51,271
- Give me the phone.
- Wh... excuse me?

703
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:52,824
<i>Stacy, are you there?</i>

704
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:54,999
This is Sergeant Bradford
with the LAPD.

705
00:28:55,009 --> 00:28:56,863
This whole conversation
is being recorded.

706
00:28:56,873 --> 00:28:58,623
You want to save me some time
and tell me your name,

707
00:28:58,633 --> 00:28:59,866
or are you gonna make me
run a trace?

708
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:01,315
<i>Wrong number.</i>

709
00:29:01,325 --> 00:29:02,869
Trace it is.

710
00:29:02,879 --> 00:29:05,285
I don't... I don't understand
what's happening right now.

711
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:06,562
You're under arrest
for the murder for hire

712
00:29:06,572 --> 00:29:07,736
of your husband.

713
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,772
- I don't understand.
- Look, we lied.

714
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,257
And I'm sorry to inform you,
your husband is dead.

715
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:13,293
He was killed last night in jail

716
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:14,639
by one of Tyson's cronies.

717
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:16,710
And, look, I couldn't see
why you wanted

718
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,195
your husband dead until
I read his criminal history.

719
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:22,716
Again, no convictions,
but multiple phone calls

720
00:29:22,726 --> 00:29:24,269
to your house
for domestic violence.

721
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,926
Throw in a mistress
and a judge authorized

722
00:29:25,936 --> 00:29:27,065
a tap on your phone.

723
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:28,480
And you just confirmed
our suspicions.

724
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,586
Okay.

725
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:31,597
Oh, my goodness.

726
00:29:34,945 --> 00:29:37,144
Judge just signed
the Ramey warrant for Conrad.

727
00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:38,490
BOLO's in the system.

728
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,285
Yeah, and we put his car in SVS.

729
00:29:40,295 --> 00:29:41,493
How was the wife found?

730
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:43,392
Kitchen floor,
facing the west wall.

731
00:29:43,402 --> 00:29:45,325
Multiple stab wounds,
weapon still outstanding.

732
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:48,259
Well, then what, wife finds
out hubby kills Cheryl

733
00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:49,467
and then confronts him?

734
00:29:49,477 --> 00:29:51,814
Hubby panics and kills
the wife to silence her.

735
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,989
He realizes what he's done
and goes on the run.

736
00:29:53,999 --> 00:29:55,576
Desperate idiot's playbook.

737
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,441
Uh, there are no clear prints
on the doorknob, just smudges.

738
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:01,997
What's the time element
for when she died?

739
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:03,895
Go ahead. You got this.

740
00:30:03,905 --> 00:30:05,448
Well, I mean, a body loses heat

741
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,830
at a rate of 1.5 degrees
per hour.

742
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,728
Thermostat is at 68.

743
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:11,178
But the body
of the victim wasn't

744
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:12,524
that cold when we found it.

745
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:15,355
So I would say about
an hour, 90 minutes tops.

746
00:30:15,365 --> 00:30:16,874
- She's right.
- Hmm.

747
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:18,082
What about the canvass?

748
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:20,256
Uh, not home, not home,
all not home.

749
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:22,155
Home, but didn't see
or hear anything.

750
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:23,604
Harper searched
Conrad's social media

751
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:24,951
and emergency contacts.

752
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:26,918
And if Conrad is running,
he's gonna need help.

753
00:30:26,928 --> 00:30:28,644
So here are his closest friends.

754
00:30:28,654 --> 00:30:30,197
Start from the bottom
and work your way up.

755
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:31,612
All right, I'll get
Chen's help with this.

756
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:32,855
She'll take odds,
we'll take evens.

757
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,201

00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:03,334
his husband, Todd.

773
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:04,818
It should be right up there...

774
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:06,071
By that Toyota.

775
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,064
Did you see that?

776
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:10,997
Yeah, I saw bushes move.
Is that Conrad?

777
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:13,585
Control, we have a possible
at location six on Brywood.

778
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:17,151
Adam-19 attach.

779
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:25,459
Conrad, I wanna see your hands.

780
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,841
7-Adam-15,
Code-6 on suspect Bataglia,

781
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:29,981
2300 block Brywood.

782
00:31:29,991 --> 00:31:31,189
Don't move.
Show me your hands!

783
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:34,962
We got a foot pursuit,
northbound Brywood!

784
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:39,853
Come here.
Get up.

785
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:41,303
- No, wait!
- Against the car!

786
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:43,270
Aah. No! Wait!

787
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,376
You don't understand!
He's trying to kill me!

788
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:47,215
Hands. Hands!

789
00:31:53,014 --> 00:31:53,971
Are you hurt anywhere else?

790
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:55,765
Just my head and right here.

791
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:58,837
All right, take us through
what happened, slowly.

792
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:02,496
This man broke
into our house and tied us up.

793
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:06,984
And he made me watch
while he killed...

794
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:09,227
while he killed Justine.

795
00:32:09,237 --> 00:32:10,988
I don't know how I got away,

796
00:32:10,998 --> 00:32:14,163
but I must have broke
the restraints.

797
00:32:14,173 --> 00:32:15,889
He tried to stop me,

798
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,236
but I got away,
and I-I just kept running.

799
00:32:18,246 --> 00:32:20,825
He's almost ready for transport.

800
00:32:20,835 --> 00:32:22,516
<i>11-79 was just reported</i>

801
00:32:22,526 --> 00:32:24,933
<i>at 1025 South Butterfield Drive.</i>

802
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,589
That's Opal's address.

803
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:29,868
Control, 7-Adam-15, you have
any more details on the 11-79?

804
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:31,905
<i>There's a man trapped under
the homeowner's vehicle.</i>

805
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:33,631
<i>Fire and RA already en route.</i>

806
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:34,873
Control, attach us to this.

807
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:36,530
Uh, Chen?

808
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,773
Yeah, what's up?

809
00:32:37,783 --> 00:32:39,257
Would you escort Conrad
to the hospital?

810
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:40,603
- He's been Mirandized.
- Yeah, of course.

811
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:42,364
Come on.

812
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:43,537
What just happened?

813
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:44,883
Something about
the Pentagram widow.

814
00:32:44,893 --> 00:32:46,092
He'll be ready to go in five.

815
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:47,403
Are they looking for him?

816
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:48,611
The guy who killed my wife?

817
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:51,097
- Can you describe him?
- I don't know.

818
00:32:51,107 --> 00:32:54,721
Uh, he was white,
average height, average weight.

819
00:32:54,731 --> 00:32:56,033
He was... he was deranged.

820
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:59,415
Any idea why he targeted you?

821
00:32:59,425 --> 00:33:02,211
Okay, look,
I want to get this guy.

822
00:33:02,221 --> 00:33:04,765
All right?
Your wife deserves justice.

823
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:07,147
But white,
average height, weight,

824
00:33:07,157 --> 00:33:09,711
that's not gonna get him.

825
00:33:11,472 --> 00:33:14,026
Does this have anything
to do with Cheryl Budny?

826
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:18,375
Uh...

827
00:33:20,964 --> 00:33:22,438
Look,

828
00:33:22,448 --> 00:33:25,786
I-I didn't mean to kill her.

829
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,996
I was just so tired of her lies.

830
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,756
We were fighting,
and I shoved her.

831
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:31,240
And I guess she hit her head.

832
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,035
All right, well, killing her
might have been an accident,

833
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:36,107
but carving a pentagram
into her stomach was not.

834
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:37,281
Why didn't you call the police?

835
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,868
I don't know.
I-I-I was scared.

836
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:42,631
I-I-I knew you guys would see
the post that I made about her.

837
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:44,633
So I tried to make it look like
it was that Pentagram guy

838
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:45,979
from the documentary.

839
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:48,119
But then today, I got a text
from Cheryl, and it said

840
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:51,053
that she wanted me to feel
the same pain that I caused.

841
00:33:51,063 --> 00:33:53,021
It's on my phone. Look.

842
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,930
Oh!

843
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:59,899
Aah!

844
00:34:13,741 --> 00:34:16,630
Officers taking fire,
2300 block of Brywood.

845
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,804
Shooter has a long gun.

846
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:20,013
23-31, we're 10-9-7 on Brywood.

847
00:34:20,023 --> 00:34:21,773
Go.

848
00:34:21,783 --> 00:34:22,888
Ready?

849
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,345
I'm clear!

850
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:50,329
Go!

851
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,926
Go!

852
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,787
Nobody else down Brywood!
He's got a clear shot.

853
00:35:09,797 --> 00:35:10,857
Stay off Brywood.

854
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:12,100
Anybody hurt?

855
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,101
We're okay.

856
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,723
Conrad's dead.

857
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:16,759
Medic took a shot in the leg.

858
00:35:16,769 --> 00:35:18,589
We can't let him escape.
We gotta seal him off.

859
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,453
We can't get a unit behind him.

860
00:35:20,463 --> 00:35:22,420
There's a fence.
The alley doesn't go through.

861
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,215
- Can't they just climb over?
- Shooter will pick 'em off

862
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:25,734
as soon as they climb up.

863
00:35:25,744 --> 00:35:28,599
Can I get an airship to help
seal off Brywood to the south?

864
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:30,048
<i>Copy. Air 11 is en route.</i>

865
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:31,533
<i>ETA, less than three minutes.</i>

866
00:35:31,543 --> 00:35:32,913
He's gonna be gone by then.

867
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,260
I can get down the alleyway
and just cut him off.

868
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,365
No, way, that's
a 40-yard open-field run.

869
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,160
Well, if his head pops up,
just blow it off.

870
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,196
I'll be all right.

871
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:40,931
Just let me know
when you're ready.

872
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:44,418
Come on.

873
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:51,735
Go.

874
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:40,671
She made it. Code-4.

875
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:42,604
And she doesn't want
to give up her position.

876
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:43,718
Smart girl.

877
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:56,065
Stop where you are!
Stop right there!

878
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:58,482
Put your hands
where I can see them.

879
00:36:58,492 --> 00:37:01,899
Turn around and put your hands
in the air.

880
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:03,945
Put your hands in the air.

881
00:37:05,913 --> 00:37:08,043
Do it now.

882
00:37:08,053 --> 00:37:10,055
Get your hand off your weapon.

883
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:13,714
Stop where you are.

884
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:18,719
Stop. Stop where you are.

885
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:32,205
Shooter's down!

886
00:37:32,215 --> 00:37:34,172
Code-4!

887
00:37:34,182 --> 00:37:36,392
I need a medic!
The shooter is down!

888
00:37:40,568 --> 00:37:41,732
In a panic, the wife of
the alleged Pentagram Killer,

889
00:37:41,742 --> 00:37:43,423
attempted to flee,

890
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:44,883
injuring a reporter
in the process.

891
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:47,945
...of the original spree.

892
00:37:47,955 --> 00:37:50,672
Our own Steve Sahagan
was almost crushed

893
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:52,856
by the frantic widow.
Steve?

894
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:57,679
Juarez, get on crowd control.
Get these people back.

895
00:37:57,689 --> 00:37:59,301
Back, folks.
Get out of the way.

896
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:01,372
Come on.

897
00:38:01,382 --> 00:38:04,444
Everyone.
I need everyone to stand back!

898
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:07,319
This is a crime scene.

899
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:12,452
Opal, what happened?

900
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:14,765
I just wanted them
to leave me alone.

901
00:38:14,775 --> 00:38:16,318
I thought you were gonna stay
with friends.

902
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,769
What friends?

903
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:20,529
I tried calling.

904
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:23,705
None of them want anything
to do with me.

905
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:27,225
It's all gone... my life,
my friends,

906
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:29,158
my home.

907
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:30,367
He took it all.

908
00:38:30,377 --> 00:38:32,689
They can't blame you
if you didn't know.

909
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:38,133
Opal, did you know?

910
00:38:38,143 --> 00:38:42,206
That my husband of 42 years
was a killer?

911
00:38:42,216 --> 00:38:45,416
Of course not.

912
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:49,765
But there... there were some...
some things.

913
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:54,090
He'd give me jewelry
that I knew we couldn't afford.

914
00:38:56,057 --> 00:39:00,189
He liked me to wear it,
and then it would disappear.

915
00:39:00,199 --> 00:39:02,961
And once I-I found...

916
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:09,923
I found a pair of ladies'
underwear in the car.

917
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:13,962
I threw them away,
but I didn't ask.

918
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:16,492
I didn't want to know.

919
00:39:19,495 --> 00:39:24,154
I didn't want to know.

920
00:39:33,232 --> 00:39:35,052
Bailey.

921
00:39:35,062 --> 00:39:36,260
Hey.

922
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:37,399
I can't leave you alone
for a minute.

923
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:39,470
- I know.
- How's Carmichael? Is he okay?

924
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,851
Yeah, he's barely scratched.

925
00:39:40,861 --> 00:39:42,059
He's going around
telling everyone

926
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:43,198
that he was shot, though.

927
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:45,200
Well, technically,
he's not wrong.

928
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:47,823
Lucy was an absolute badass
out there, though.

929
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,238
We're still waiting to hear
if the guy she shot's

930
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,239
gonna pull through.

931
00:39:50,249 --> 00:39:52,276
Well, patrol found 87 guns

932
00:39:52,286 --> 00:39:53,588
at that guy's house.

933
00:39:53,598 --> 00:39:55,313
Looks like he finally
found a reason to use 'em.

934
00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:56,901
That's unbelievable.

935
00:39:56,911 --> 00:39:58,075
How's the reporter?

936
00:39:58,085 --> 00:40:00,042
In surgery.
Opal crushed his leg.

937
00:40:00,052 --> 00:40:02,010
What's gonna happen to her?

938
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,632
Well, about 50 reporters
got the whole thing on camera,

939
00:40:03,642 --> 00:40:05,807
so there's not gonna be a lot
of wiggle room for the defense.

940
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:09,017
Yeah, the Pentagram Killer's
last victims.

941
00:40:09,027 --> 00:40:10,674
- Hey.
- Hey.

942
00:40:10,684 --> 00:40:11,985
- Why are you here?
- The, uh...

943
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,780
the Pentagram widow
ran over a reporter.

944
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,585
Right, right.

945
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:19,614
I passed Tim's TRAIN test.

946
00:40:19,624 --> 00:40:20,994
- Congrats.
- Yeah.

947
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,858
I knew you would.

948
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:24,412
Didn't you have to get punched
in the face

949
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,034
- or something to pass?
- Oh, I did.

950
00:40:26,044 --> 00:40:27,656
I mean, she was only
like 90 pounds,

951
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:30,452
but it still counts, you know.

952
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:32,281
Anyways, I came to see
if there's any news

953
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,180
on Lucy's shooting.

954
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,664

You didn't have to take my hero
suggestion so literally.

968
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:20,226
I don't feel like a hero at all.

969
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:21,710
Any news?

970
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:25,265
He's still in surgery right now.

971
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:27,785
What if he dies?

972
00:41:27,795 --> 00:41:30,478
What if I killed that guy?

973
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,386
Then we'll deal with it.

974
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:40,695
Jeff Budny made it
through surgery.

975
00:41:40,705 --> 00:41:42,179
They're taking him to the ICU.

976
00:41:42,189 --> 00:41:44,457
Wait, he's alive?

977
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:45,838

for the shooting inquiry.

979
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,599
And should he die
from his injuries

980
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:50,808
at a later time,
the investigation will resume.

981
00:41:50,818 --> 00:41:53,535
But try not to worry
about that right now.

982
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:54,916
Can the statement wait?

983
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:58,609
Yeah, tomorrow morning's fine.

00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:00,725
