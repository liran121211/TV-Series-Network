1
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:05,602
I mean, it's been a few decades.

2
00:00:05,626 --> 00:00:07,224
All right, what was the proper etiquette

3
00:00:07,248 --> 00:00:10,055
when they would... like,
would have sleepovers?

4
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:11,642
You mean, when they're hooking up?

5
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,058
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:14,783
No nudity in shared spaces.

7
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,958
You seeing a little more of
the boyfriend than you care to?

8
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:18,373
So much more.

9
00:00:18,397 --> 00:00:19,616
You need to set some boundaries.

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,376
I have, regularly.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,817
And yet, I still got an eyeful
of Willy wonka this morning.

12
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,728
Where the hell are they going? Control,

13
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:30,282
7-Adam-15.

14
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:33,112
Advise status on any code
3 events near our location?

15
00:00:33,136 --> 00:00:35,183
<i>Negative, 7-Adam-15.</i>

16
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:36,219
What was their hurry?

17
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:38,245
Let's find out.

18
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:48,748
Smitty, go to channel 9.

19
00:00:48,772 --> 00:00:49,784
Go for smitty.

20
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,096
Where's your shop?

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,235
Where's my shop?

22
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,088
It's parked right out

23
00:00:56,228 --> 00:00:57,850
wait a minute.

24
00:01:15,937 --> 00:01:17,329
What's happening?

25
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:19,089
I've been waiting for you to wake up.

26
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:22,392
I think we should have a baby.

27
00:01:23,635 --> 00:01:25,682
Is that something you're open to?

28
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:28,133
I'm... I... I... I don't know.

29
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:30,687
I love being a dad, but I think I thought

30
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:34,863
maybe my days of dirty
diapers and sleepless nights

31
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:36,106
were over.

32
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,590
But you were about to foster Anna.

33
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:38,591
No, yes.

34
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:39,972
That's true, I was.

35
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:42,319
But she had no one.

36
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:44,897
I think it kind of... it felt like fate.

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,842
So is that a no?

38
00:01:47,866 --> 00:01:50,569
No, it's... it's an, "a I haven't even had"

39
00:01:50,593 --> 00:01:51,673
"a cup of coffee yet.

40
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:54,745
Maybe we table this till later."

41
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:56,022
Absolutely.

42
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,817
This is a really big conversation,

43
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:59,267
so let's just think about it,

44
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,786
and we can talk again after work.

45
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:01,856
Right.

46
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,984
Ok.

47
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:10,347
Yeah?

48
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:12,349
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how stressed are you?

49
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:13,937
- 19.
- Yikes.

50
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:14,938
Tim still ghosting you?

51
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,422
He's not ghosting me.

52
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:18,114
We just haven't talked
in a couple of days.

53
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,219
Not speaking to the person you're dating

54
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:22,428
is the definition of ghosting.

55
00:02:22,452 --> 00:02:23,464
I realize that.

56
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:24,879
Thank you.

57
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:27,261
So this probably isn't a good time to add

58
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:30,056
more stress to your plate.

59
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,024
What's wrong?

60
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:33,543
Nothing.

61
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:36,097
It's just I have a group
of friends at school,

62
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:37,478
and they're getting a place together,

63
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:39,721
and I was thinking of joining them.

64
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:40,895
You're moving?

65
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,507
Kind of.

66
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,658
- That's great.
- Really?

67
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,108
Yeah.

68
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:49,145
I mean, you should live
with people your own age.

69
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,216
I mean, I'll miss seeing you every day,

70
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,460
but if it makes you
happy, then that's great.

71
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:55,530
Good.

72
00:02:55,554 --> 00:02:57,256
I was worried you'd be upset.

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,775
The house they picked is really cool.

74
00:02:58,799 --> 00:03:00,363
I'll show you pictures after school.

75
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:01,560
I can't wait.

76
00:03:11,052 --> 00:03:12,098
Hey.

77
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:13,272
Have you talked to Tim recently?

78
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:14,584
No.

79
00:03:14,608 --> 00:03:16,068
I heard he was taking vacation days.

80
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:17,311
- Do you think he's in trouble?
- Yes.

81
00:03:17,335 --> 00:03:18,405
I

82
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,763
He said that if he tells
me what he's doing,

83
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:24,318
I could put my career in jeopardy.

84
00:03:24,342 --> 00:03:25,422
That's alarming.

85
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:26,492
I know.

86
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:28,529
Should I... should I tell grey?

87
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:29,875
No.

88
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:31,497
Hard as it is, you need to trust him.

89
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:33,258
Whatever he's doing, I'm
sure Tim's got it handled.

90
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,845
Ok.

91
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:37,400
So I'm just supposed to do
nothing, patrol like normal,

92
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:39,402
pretend like I'm not
worried out of my mind?

93
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:40,565
For now, yes.

94
00:03:43,153 --> 00:03:44,224
Thanks.

95
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:48,721
<i>And if you're just joining us</i>

96
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,620
<i>it's been a pitcher's clinic here,</i>

97
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:54,244
<i>tied ball game in the
bottom of the seventh, 2-all.</i>

98
00:03:54,268 --> 00:03:55,418
Hi.

99
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:57,213
My god.

100
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,042
What are you doing?

101
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:00,630
Being a friend.

102
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:02,528
What are you doing?

103
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:03,529
Talk.

104
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:04,599
I can't.

105
00:04:04,623 --> 00:04:05,911
For your own good.

106
00:04:05,935 --> 00:04:07,533
Are you engaged in a criminal act?

107
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:08,914
Not at the moment.

108
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:10,571
Then tell me.

109
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:14,299
Angela, this goes sideways
and you're anywhere near it,

110
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:15,610
you could be fired.

111
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:17,440
If Lucy gets fired, it's a problem.

112
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:20,028
If I get fired, I start living
off my husband's trust fund

113
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,168
and call it wine o'clock.

114
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:24,412
So spill.

115
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:28,105
I'm tailing this guy from
my old unit, ray Watkins.

116
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:31,281
Spent his deployment
ripping off Iraqi locals,

117
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,766
got a couple of my men killed.

118
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:36,873
Till a few days ago, I thought he was kia.

119
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:38,461
Somehow he survived and now he's

120
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:40,532
living under a different
name as a hired gun.

121
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:41,671
So why tail him?

122
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:42,913
At a minimum, he's awol.

123
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:44,984
Why not just detain him and turn him

124
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:46,296
over to the military police?

125
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,815
Because he's got something on me.

126
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,302
He knows I lied on the
report about his death.

127
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,270
So you're trying to
catch him in a fresh crime,

128
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,064
arrest him for what he's doing now.

129
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,825
Exactly.

130
00:04:57,849 --> 00:04:59,102
Cool.

131
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:00,897
I'm in.

132
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,071
Are you sure?

133
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,072
Yeah.

134
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:05,235
I got your back, boo.

135
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:08,974
You're having a baby?

136
00:05:08,998 --> 00:05:09,975
That's so great.

137
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:11,287
That's not what I said.

138
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,117
I said Bailey wants to have a baby.

139
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:18,328
And you don't, because you're ol... der

140
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:21,711
and feel like your child
raising years are behind you?

141
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:24,058
Look, I loved raising Henry.

142
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:25,646
It was incredible.

143
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,304
But there is a lot I want
to accomplish on the job,

144
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,997
and I don't have a lot of
time left, because I am older.

145
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:35,828
Ok, I get that, but have you seen babies?

146
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:37,761
They're so cute, and I feel like you

147
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:39,073
should have like three.

148
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,419
Ok.

149
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:42,732
I am deleting Bailey's
number from your phone.

150
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,768
We're being assigned to assist

151
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:47,392
city safe la in cleaning
up an encampment

152
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:49,152
of unhoused residents.

153
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:53,042
La county sheriff is bringing
a group of inmates to assist.

154
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,228
Ma'am?

155
00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:57,367
Excuse me, ma'am? I cannot let you

156
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,575
- everything ok?
- Yeah.

157
00:05:58,599 --> 00:05:59,956
No.

158
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,233
He won't let me bring
drinks to my daughter

159
00:06:01,257 --> 00:06:02,372
and her friends.

160
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:03,856
Come on. They're dying in this heat.

161
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,341
Ma'am, it is 70 degrees.

162
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,790
Is your daughter homeless?

163
00:06:06,814 --> 00:06:08,654
No, she's one of the inmates.

164
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:10,311
- Mom.
- Honey.

165
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,209
Hey.

166
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:14,235
Trustee, get back here.

167
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:16,213
I missed you.

168
00:06:16,237 --> 00:06:17,214
Me too.

169
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:18,595
You smell good.

170
00:06:18,619 --> 00:06:19,665
Ooh, you don't, but I still love you.

171
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:20,804
No contact.

172
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:22,392
Ok, hey, hey, what's the harm?

173
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,876
We're literally surrounded by police.

174
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,119
You're not the one who has to search her

175
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:26,638
for contraband after this.

176
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:28,053
You, leave.

177
00:06:28,077 --> 00:06:30,158
You, back to work.

178
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,401
See you in two weeks.

179
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:32,530
Yeah.

180
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:37,614
I hope you have a horrible day.

181
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:39,409
Give me the bag. Let it go.

182
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,204
Let it go. Let it go.

183
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:43,620
- Hey. - Give it...
- hey. - Let it go.

184
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:44,690
Hey, what's going on?

185
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:45,760
She's trying to steal my bag.

186
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:47,210
Sir, no she's not, ok?

187
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:48,798
We're going to pack up your belongings

188
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:50,420
- and send them to the shelter.
- Yeah, yeah.

189
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,215
That's the same thing you said last time.

190
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:53,872
When I got my tent back, it
was ripped in three places.

191
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:55,356
Ok, how about we let
him hold on to the bag

192
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,393
for a little bit?

193
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,464
Whoa, hang on. Hang on.

194
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:00,499
Thank you.

195
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:03,744
Give it to me... sir, back up.

196
00:07:03,768 --> 00:07:04,803
Hey, officer Nolan?

197
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,130
Do you remember
the Karina Lewis case?

198
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:12,753
Yeah.

199
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:15,169
College gymnast, boyfriend
murdered her a few years back,

200
00:07:15,193 --> 00:07:16,550
but the body was never found.

201
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:17,551
Yeah.

202
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:18,586
This is her bag.

203
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,864
It went missing along with her.

204
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:22,901
Sir, where did you get this bag?

205
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,558
Hey, I found that.

206
00:07:24,582 --> 00:07:26,249
I swear.

207
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:28,009
This place just became a crime scene.

208
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,045
Lock it down.

209
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:30,529
Officer Nolan?

210
00:07:30,553 --> 00:07:32,186
What now?

211
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,360
I just found these in the garbage can.

212
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:36,145
And one of the prisoners just escaped.

213
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:45,924
- So, where'd you get this?
- Well, I didn't steal it.

214
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:47,408
Y'all assume just
because we're homeless

215
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,099
I don't assume anything, but stealing it

216
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:50,825
is better than taking it off a murder victim

217
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:53,034
making yourself a suspect.

218
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:54,450
Yeah, well, it was neither
of those things, all right?

219
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,936
I found the bag in Griffith park last week.

220
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,351
- I can show you where.
- Ok.

221
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:00,732
Good. Let's go.

222
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:01,871
You're riding with me.

223
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:03,068
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:08:05,968 --> 00:08:07,428
Payoff.

225
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:08,843
Maybe he's smuggling
something into the country.

226
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,327
Or out.

227
00:08:10,351 --> 00:08:12,019
Or maybe ray lost a bet and is innocent.

228
00:08:12,043 --> 00:08:13,779
I mean, you've been
following this guy for two days

229
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:15,574
and haven't seen
anything remotely criminal.

230
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:17,265
How long are you going to keep this up?

231
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,750
- As long as it takes.
- Really?

232
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:20,545
You just walk away from your job,

233
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,581
your relationship with Lucy
to arrest a guy you haven't

234
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,134
thought about in a decade?

235
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:25,228
Yeah.

236
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,139
What?

237
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:32,211
If you lied on a report, you
must have had a good reason.

238
00:08:32,235 --> 00:08:34,593
I was trying to protect
Ray's family so they'd

239
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:36,112
- get his death benefits.
- Noble.

240
00:08:36,136 --> 00:08:37,838
Lucy would understand that.

241
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:39,287
Yeah, but she'd still get
in trouble if she didn't notify

242
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,910
ia about my transgression.

243
00:08:40,934 --> 00:08:42,038
True.

244
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,811
This is very irritating.

245
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:47,848
I don't think you're just protecting her.

246
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,643
I think you're protecting yourself.

247
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:52,024
There's something else you
did that you don't want to admit.

248
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:53,578
And you're basing this on?

249
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:54,579
I'm your bff.

250
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:55,994
I know you.

251
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:57,167
I'm a grown man.

252
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:58,617
I don't have bffs.

253
00:08:58,641 --> 00:09:00,201
Technically, you can only have one bff.

254
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:07,557
I'm going to take a closer look.

255
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,627
Wait.

256
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:11,067
Come on.

257
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:39,693
Mystery man had diplomatic plates.

258
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:40,866
We follow him or stay with ray?

259
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,558
Ray.

260
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,008
I can ask my friend at state
for help iding the new player.

261
00:09:45,032 --> 00:09:46,354
<i>Missing inmate is Teresa Vaughn,</i>

262
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:47,735
the girl you allowed to make contact

263
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,530
- with a potential accomplice.
- Ok.

264
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:50,842
You're blaming me because
you failed to do your job?

265
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:51,912
What the hell did you say?

266
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:53,154
Ok.

267
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:54,604
We can play the blame game later.

268
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,433
Right now, we have a fugitive to find.

269
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:58,263
I agree it's most likely the
mother that helped her escape.

270
00:09:58,287 --> 00:09:59,540
That's our first lead.

271
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:01,369
We can put a bolo out for Theresa.

272
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,095
Why was Theresa incarcerated?

273
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:06,996
Assault, but she only had
ten days left on her sentence.

274
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,549
That doesn't make any sense.

275
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:10,724
Trying to escape would
add at least a year.

276
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:11,887
Why risk it?

277
00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:16,557
I was just reviewing the
details in Karina's case.

278
00:10:16,581 --> 00:10:18,835
She disappeared 19 months ago.

279
00:10:18,859 --> 00:10:20,630
Boyfriend was the immediate suspect.

280
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:22,701
He ultimately confessed to strangling her

281
00:10:22,725 --> 00:10:24,392
in his apartment down in culver city,

282
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,809
then he claims he blacked
out afterwards and forgot

283
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,465
where he left the body.

284
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:31,123
Any of this looking familiar to you?

285
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:32,711
Yeah, a little.

286
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:34,679
I was trying to find a place to sleep.

287
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:37,233
Everything was so wet
because of the storm,

288
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:38,579
but it was around here though.

289
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,374
You know, a big flat rock.

290
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:41,375
There.

291
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,376
There it is right there.

292
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,757
Behind there.

293
00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:45,621
It was all muddy when I went through it.

294
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,037
I was hoping to find some
cash or some food on the inside,

295
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:49,935
but there was only a
couple of schoolbooks.

296
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,696
Yeah, the rain could
have dislodged the bag

297
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,928
causing it to go downhill.

298
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:13,234
Karina Lewis.

299
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:16,123
Well, at least now her family
can give her a proper burial.

300
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:24,211
You said the boyfriend
confessed to strangling her?

301
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:25,695
Yeah.

302
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,835
Then why is there a
bullet wound in her head?

303
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:30,907
That's a small caliber, ...22, maybe .38.

304
00:11:30,931 --> 00:11:33,427
Why confess to the murder
but lie about the method?

305
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:34,704
<i>It makes no sense.</i>

306
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,189
Teresa Vaughn was
serving six months for assault

307
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:40,330
on a woman she claimed was
hooking up with her boyfriend.

308
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:42,298
I'm not sure that's the
person I'd be assaulting.

309
00:11:42,322 --> 00:11:44,058
Not that violence is ever the answer.

310
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:47,717
<i>7-Adam-15, 7-Adam-6
pulled over your bolo alert.</i>

311
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,512
<i>Brenda Vaughn, fugitive's
mother, third and oak.</i>

312
00:11:49,536 --> 00:11:50,513
Copy that.

313
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,297
Show us responding.

314
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,938
No sign of the fugitive.

315
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:03,768
- I told you.
- Thank you.

316
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:05,390
Would you mind going to her house

317
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:06,494
in case the daughter
decides to show up there?

318
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:08,738
You got it.

319
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,361
I get how this looks,
but I had nothing to do

320
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:12,949
with my daughter's escape.

321
00:12:12,973 --> 00:12:14,433
Any idea where your
daughter might have gone?

322
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:15,745
No.

323
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,436
But any place is better than jail, right?

324
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,300
Not when you have two
weeks left on your sentence.

325
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:21,199
Why would she throw that away now?

326
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:23,995
Did you say something to
her, tell her a secret when

327
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:25,686
- you were giving her a hug?
- No.

328
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,481
Ok, so then you just
expect me to believe it's

329
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:30,035
a coincidence she escaped
right after you showed up?

330
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,349
I can't control what you
believe, but it's the truth.

331
00:12:33,373 --> 00:12:34,799
Do you have kids?

332
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:36,110
Yeah, I have one.

333
00:12:36,134 --> 00:12:37,525
Then you understand that I would

334
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,804
do anything to help my daughter,

335
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:41,806
including practicing tough love, ok?

336
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,704
If Teresa asked me to help her escape,

337
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:46,362
I would have told her it is the
dumbest idea I'd ever heard

338
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:48,226
and just suck it up and finish her time.

339
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,538
Any idea who might help your daughter

340
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:52,126
despite the consequences?

341
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,164
She has a lot of friends,
but I doubt any of them

342
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:56,890
would stick their necks out for her.

343
00:12:56,914 --> 00:12:58,650
- What about the boyfriend?
- Mike?

344
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:00,169
No.

345
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:02,861
He broke up with her right
after she attacked Doreen.

346
00:13:02,885 --> 00:13:04,138
That's where.

347
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:05,553
That's where what?

348
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:08,004
Teresa is still pissed about the affair.

349
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:13,182
She told me she was planning
on doing some permanent damage

350
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,701
to Doreen when she got out.

351
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:17,738
Control, I'm going to need
an address on a Doreen...

352
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:19,188
- Davis.
- Davis.

353
00:13:19,212 --> 00:13:21,214
Home and work.

354
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:27,230
Doreen?

355
00:13:27,254 --> 00:13:28,231
Yeah.

356
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:30,544
What's going on?

357
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:32,753
Teresa Vaughn escaped
from custody this morning.

358
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:34,237
Escaped?

359
00:13:34,261 --> 00:13:35,998
Yeah, but we're going
to make sure you're safe.

360
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:37,793
Yeah, you don't need to.

361
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:39,518
Teresa came by like half an hour ago,

362
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:43,522
said that she got released early.

363
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:45,179
Apologized for everything.

364
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:46,767
Said that she should have
listened to me when I said

365
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:48,458
- I didn't hook up with Mike.
- Wait.

366
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:49,632
So there was no affair?

367
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:51,461
No. Mike and I were friends.

368
00:13:51,485 --> 00:13:53,049
That's it.

369
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:55,465
But he was definitely
cheating on her with someone.

370
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:57,536
Well, did she say where
she was going next?

371
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,744
No.

372
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:01,392
Just she finally knew who to blame.

373
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:05,682
You're too close.

374
00:14:05,706 --> 00:14:07,443
I can't tail him by nose
with only one vehicle.

375
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,927
- Need to keep him in sight.
- We're going to get made.

376
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:10,431
- You should let me drive.
- I got it.

377
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:29,154
I come in peace.

378
00:14:29,178 --> 00:14:30,569
Who's your friend?

379
00:14:30,593 --> 00:14:31,570
Ooh.

380
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:33,227
Hey, mama.

381
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,642
I thought you said this guy
was smart because all I see

382
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,678
is slick.

383
00:14:35,702 --> 00:14:37,404
What's the plan here, sarge?

384
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:39,061
You just going to follow
me around all week while I

385
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:40,683
wait for my mom to kick it?

386
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:44,169
Yeah, we both know
you're not here for your mom.

387
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:45,446
Mark bailed on you?

388
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,965
Did he lose his nerve?

389
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:48,864
Maybe you did.

390
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,626
Was there a falling out
over what to do with me?

391
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,801
Let me guess, he
was team extermination

392
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:58,943
and you were team justice.

393
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:04,672
You know, this guy's nickname
in the service was the reaper.

394
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:07,527
It's sad when one of your
heroes grows a conscience.

395
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:11,610
I'm going to go now.

396
00:15:11,634 --> 00:15:14,544
I'm open to some
company if you want a lift.

397
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:17,962
I'll pass, but we'll be
seeing you again real soon.

398
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:20,160
Can't wait.

399
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,353
Thank you for meeting with us.

400
00:15:29,377 --> 00:15:30,629
Yeah, no problem.

401
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:32,183
Actually, you could help
me out with something.

402
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:35,151
I have to approve a headshot
for my campaign website.

403
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:38,454
Which one of these looks
more district attorney-ish?

404
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,054
The one on the right.

405
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:43,988
I agree.

406
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:48,406
We need to talk about a case
that you prosecuted last year.

407
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,510
Karina Lewis.

408
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:50,960
Karina Lewis?

409
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:53,238
Yeah, the boyfriend strangled her,

410
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:54,412
full confession.

411
00:15:54,436 --> 00:15:55,723
He pled out, doing 20 at soledad.

412
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:56,897
Right.

413
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:59,831
Well, we found her remains today.

414
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:01,143
Well, hey, that's great news.

415
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,972
The family can finally put her to rest.

416
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:06,286
Yes, but the only problem
is, she was not strangled.

417
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,588
She was shot in the head with a .22.

418
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:11,808
Boyfriend lied in his statement.

419
00:16:11,832 --> 00:16:13,603
Right, which clearly was coerced.

420
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:16,952
Officer thorsen is
getting ahead of himself,

421
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,541
but it is a significant inconsistency.

422
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:23,130
Is there any chance it
was a false confession?

423
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:24,131
No.

424
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:25,236
Are you serious?

425
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,720
That fast, just no?

426
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:29,895
Officer thorsen, wait
for me outside, please?

427
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,518
- Ma'am...
- go.

428
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:32,646
Now.

429
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,699
I apologize.

430
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:43,004
He clearly has brought some
of his own history into this.

431
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:47,810
Look, you weren't there,
detective, and neither was he.

432
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:50,054
The investigation was solid.

433
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:51,917
The boyfriend had a history of violence.

434
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:54,472
Hair matching the victim was
found in the trunk of his car.

435
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:56,163
Witnesses heard them arguing.

436
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:57,578
I could have gotten a conviction

437
00:16:57,602 --> 00:16:59,063
even without his confession.

438
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,650
So kindly invite officer thorsen

439
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:02,790
to take his self-righteousness and stick it

440
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,207
where the sun don't shine.

441
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:06,518
Are we done here?

442
00:17:06,542 --> 00:17:07,647
Yes, sir.

443
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,354
Is he really not going to do anything?

444
00:17:14,378 --> 00:17:16,321
You cannot talk to a prosecutor like that.

445
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:18,323
Detective... ever.

446
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:20,049
Do you understand?

447
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,465
Yes.

448
00:17:22,489 --> 00:17:24,433
Does this mean we're
abandoning the investigation?

449
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,711
There is no we in this, officer thorsen.

450
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:28,333
This is not our investigation.

451
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:31,543
It is mine, which means
that the risk of pissing off

452
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:34,443
someone who will likely
be the next district attorney

453
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,272
falls on me.

454
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:37,825
Ok.

455
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:39,689
Does this mean you're
abandoning the investigation?

456
00:17:39,713 --> 00:17:41,070
No.

457
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:43,038
It means that we need to
find undeniable evidence

458
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,970
that Karina Lewis was killed by someone

459
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:46,455
other than the guy who is currently

460
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,250
sitting in prison before we can even

461
00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:49,792
think about coming back here.

462
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,497
Why are you smiling?

463
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:55,867
Because you said we.

464
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:05,129
Were there any other suspects

465
00:18:05,153 --> 00:18:06,716
aside from the boyfriend?

466
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,235
Yeah.

467
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:09,719
A guy used to work with
Karina at her off-campus job,

468
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:11,376
Ryan Jones.

469
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,896
And fun fact, the detective
that interviewed him said Ryan

470
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,277
was quite the gun collector.

471
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:17,072
So it is likely he would own a .22.

472
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,694
Exactly.

473
00:18:18,718 --> 00:18:21,110
In my professional opinion,
his alibi was super shaky.

474
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,216
Need I remind you, five minutes,

475
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,324
that your professional opinion
is still a work in progress?

476
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:29,532
Noted.

477
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,155
But Ryan claimed he was hanging out

478
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:33,226
at his girlfriend's apartment.

479
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,055
That is a little shaky.

480
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,978
But it is nowhere near
enough to move the needle.

481
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:42,580
<i>Kids here?</i>

482
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,340
They're at my mom's.

483
00:18:44,364 --> 00:18:46,101
Wes is going to pick them up
on his way home, which makes

484
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,343
this the perfect time for
you to tell me why you

485
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,069
think this is all your fault.

486
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:50,070
I don't.

487
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:51,313
Come on.

488
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:52,441
Sit.

489
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:01,046
There is no way you let a
loser like ray live under your skin

490
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,876
if you didn't blame
yourself for more than just

491
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,878
lying on a report.

492
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:11,195
Look, I had been squad
leader most of my second tour,

493
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:15,026
top performance ratings,
fast track to a promotion,

494
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,649
unless my battalion
commander found out

495
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:19,962
that a soldier in my unit was engaged

496
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:21,860
in rampant criminality.

497
00:19:21,884 --> 00:19:24,449
I thought if I brought ray in myself,

498
00:19:24,473 --> 00:19:26,658
I could keep it within the squad.

499
00:19:26,682 --> 00:19:29,972
No harm, no foul, and
I would be sergeant

500
00:19:29,996 --> 00:19:31,836
first class in no time.

501
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,762
So we went after him,
unsanctioned, under the radar.

502
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:44,814
We located him in a
village just outside of mosul.

503
00:19:44,838 --> 00:19:46,644
As soon as he found out he was trapped,

504
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:51,890
he called in an air
strike right on top of us.

505
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:56,101
It was like the world exploded.

506
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,760
I thought I was going to die, Angela.

507
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:01,348
But I got lucky.

508
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:04,099
The Humvee that Mark and I
were behind, it saved us but,

509
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:14,282
but Henderson and coyle,
they were blown apart.

510
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:18,848
I still don't know how ray survived.

511
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:20,505
I mean, the building he was in,

512
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:22,645
it was almost completely destroyed.

513
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:26,753
There... we found his mangled
dog tags in the wreckage.

514
00:20:26,777 --> 00:20:31,482
I mean, there was...
there was so much blood.

515
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:35,831
Without question,
we thought he was kia.

516
00:20:35,855 --> 00:20:43,804
I mean, it was... it was
a spectacular failure

517
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:46,117
of leadership.

518
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:50,086
I put my career above my oath and

519
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:55,357
two soldiers, two decent men,
didn't come home that night.

520
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,164
And I'm going to have to live with that

521
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:02,088
for the rest of my life.

522
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:27,848
What are you still doing here?

523
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:29,850
I'm just going over
the Karina Lewis case.

524
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:31,428
Right. I heard they found her body.

525
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:36,892
Detectives questioned
this guy for over ten hours

526
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,169
without his lawyer, right?

527
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:39,688
He's young.

528
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,345
He's scared.

529
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,381
In retrospect, it's possible
he could have been coerced.

530
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:44,382
Ok.

531
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:45,832
So take another look.

532
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,352
If he was, get the conviction overturned.

533
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:49,870
It's not that simple.

534
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:51,355
Because you're running for da.

535
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:52,839
Yeah.

536
00:21:52,863 --> 00:21:54,047
And how's it going to look
when it comes out that you

537
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:55,324
railroaded an innocent man?

538
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:56,463
Hey, I didn't railroad anybody.

539
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:58,016
This was a very solid case.

540
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,709
Based on a possibly
questionable confession.

541
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,391
Yeah.

542
00:22:10,294 --> 00:22:11,927
You really dove in.

543
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:14,826
Yeah, I wanted to make
an informed decision.

544
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:15,896
And?

545
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,244
And I'm more sure than ever.

546
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:20,649
I want to have a baby.

547
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:24,733
And you don't.

548
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:26,769
And I don't know.

549
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:29,979
Some days, this job is all I can handle.

550
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:33,604
When I had Henry, I was the boss.

551
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:35,778
I never had to miss a school play or

552
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:37,884
a parent-teacher conference.

553
00:22:37,908 --> 00:22:39,955
I don't have that now, which means

554
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:43,199
I can't be the kind of dad I want to be

555
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:45,443
or the cop I want to be.

556
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:46,755
So that's a no.

557
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:48,722
It's a big decision.

558
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:51,449
I just... I need more than
a day to think about it.

559
00:22:51,473 --> 00:22:53,520
Well, if you are trying to figure out a way

560
00:22:53,544 --> 00:22:55,902
to let me down easy, don't.

561
00:22:55,926 --> 00:22:58,732
The longer you let me
have hope, the more painful

562
00:22:58,756 --> 00:23:01,828
it'll be.

563
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:11,504
Just in time.

564
00:23:11,528 --> 00:23:13,471
I ordered pizza.

565
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:15,197
Thank you.

566
00:23:15,221 --> 00:23:18,027
I have been dreading having to cook.

567
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:19,546
Any news on the Tim front?

568
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,134
Not yet.

569
00:23:21,158 --> 00:23:26,646
So I'm just practicing
trust, Patience, and I hate it.

570
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:29,314
That was quick.

571
00:23:29,338 --> 00:23:30,409
I'm going to get changed.

572
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:35,044
Hey, there.

573
00:23:35,068 --> 00:23:36,529
I'm ray.

574
00:23:36,553 --> 00:23:38,427
Tim's friend.

575
00:23:38,451 --> 00:23:40,153
He's not here.

576
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:42,949
That's cool.

577
00:23:42,973 --> 00:23:44,847
Lucy?

578
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,010
Yeah?

579
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:50,784
Can I help you?

580
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:52,027
I hope so.

581
00:23:52,051 --> 00:23:55,789
You Tim's girlfriend?

582
00:23:55,813 --> 00:23:57,757
You don't need that.

583
00:23:57,781 --> 00:23:59,034
I'm here to help you, not hurt you.

584
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:00,035
Yeah.

585
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,036
I think I'm going to pass.

586
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,934
You need to leave.

587
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,108
Tim never mentioned me?

588
00:24:04,132 --> 00:24:05,730
I have no idea who you are.

589
00:24:05,754 --> 00:24:08,215
So how would I know if he
has mentioned you or not?

590
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,803
Why don't you call Tim?

591
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:12,288
Ask him about mosul.

592
00:24:12,312 --> 00:24:13,876
The only phone call I'm going to make

593
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,844
is for an ambulance
to wheel you out of here

594
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:19,319
unless you get out right now.

595
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,436
No problem.

596
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,472
You tell Tim to take a knee.

597
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:24,956
I'm going to be gone in a few days,

598
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,088
unless he gives me a
reason to stick around.

599
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:37,199
Who the hell is that guy?

600
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,287
What?

601
00:24:45,311 --> 00:24:46,357
Hey, what's wrong?

602
00:24:46,381 --> 00:24:47,600
Where are you?

603
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:48,567
Lucy.

604
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:50,143
Where the hell are you?

605
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,502
What happened?

606
00:24:52,526 --> 00:24:53,709
Your buddy ray stopped by.

607
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:54,710
Are you ok?

608
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:56,367
Do I look ok?

609
00:24:56,391 --> 00:24:58,265
Let's give them a minute.

610
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,991
What if Tamara had
been there by herself

611
00:25:00,015 --> 00:25:01,648
- when that creep showed up?
- I'm sorry.

612
00:25:01,672 --> 00:25:02,994
- I had no idea.
- No!

613
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:04,548
No. No more excuses, Tim.

614
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:06,584
You have to tell me
what's going on with you.

615
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:07,792
Right now.

616
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:08,921
Now!

617
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:13,280
His name is ray Watkins.

618
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:14,765
He was under my command in Iraq.

619
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:16,491
I thought he was killed
in action, but he's back,

620
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,699
and he's going to hurt someone if I

621
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:19,977
don't do something about it.

622
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:21,392
None of that

623
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:23,083
none of it explains why you cut me off.

624
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:24,084
No.

625
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:25,189
It doesn't.

626
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:26,673
Stop trying to protect me, Tim!

627
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:28,088
I'm sorry. I can't, ok?

628
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:29,365
I won't.

629
00:25:29,389 --> 00:25:30,781
- You read Lopez in.
- It's different.

630
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:32,023
How?

631
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:33,508
She has less to lose than you.

632
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,545
Please, just steer
clear of this for me, ok?

633
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:37,546
I can't.

634
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,754
I won't.

635
00:25:38,778 --> 00:25:40,998
You clearly need help, and I am done

636
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:42,447
being the good girlfriend, ok?

637
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:43,587
You don't have to tell me everything,

638
00:25:43,611 --> 00:25:45,267
but you are going to let me in.

639
00:25:50,652 --> 00:25:51,802
She is about a year old now, right?

640
00:25:51,826 --> 00:25:52,975
Yeah, that's right.

641
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:54,080
So she's sleeping pretty good?

642
00:25:54,104 --> 00:25:55,599
You really do not remember what

643
00:25:55,623 --> 00:25:57,324
it is like to have young kids, do you?

644
00:25:57,348 --> 00:25:58,705
No, I guess I don't.

645
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:00,983
I'm running on a cold
brew and adrenaline,

646
00:26:01,007 --> 00:26:02,122
but it's worth it.

647
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:03,710
Right.

648
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:05,229
Why, are you and Bailey
thinking about having a kid?

649
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:06,392
She is.

650
00:26:08,014 --> 00:26:09,682
I just don't know that I
can juggle a kid and the job.

651
00:26:09,706 --> 00:26:11,338
Well, I manage. So does Lopez.

652
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,685
- So did grey.
- Right.

653
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:13,858
But you're younger.

654
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:15,066
So was he.

655
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,447
Just starting out in your careers.

656
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:18,104
I am a little late to the party.

657
00:26:18,128 --> 00:26:21,417
I've got maybe ten years
to maximize my career

658
00:26:21,441 --> 00:26:22,902
before it's all but over.

659
00:26:22,926 --> 00:26:25,456
Look, it's a cliché, because it is true.

660
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,527
There's really never a
good time to have a kid.

661
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:29,494
But you know, you make it work.

662
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:31,048
Thank you.

663
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:32,981
I know who was sleeping
with Teresa's boyfriend.

664
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:35,742
So this is her and Mike last
year before she was arrested.

665
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:37,917
Anything look familiar?

666
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:40,195
Teresa's mom was
wearing that shirt yesterday.

667
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:41,817
And Teresa said she smelled great.

668
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:43,301
Yeah, because she
smelled like her boyfriend,

669
00:26:43,325 --> 00:26:44,820
and she didn't realize it until after.

670
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:46,857
And when she figured
it out, she lost her mind

671
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:48,513
and took off.

672
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:50,205
But why go apologize
to Doreen and not go

673
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:51,827
straight to her mom's place?

674
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:53,484
Well, we've had a shop
parked outside her mom's place

675
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:56,211
since she escaped.

676
00:26:56,235 --> 00:26:59,007
But not Mike's place.

677
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:01,734
Miss Marcos, thanks for
coming in on short notice.

678
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:03,218
Of course.

679
00:27:03,242 --> 00:27:06,083
You mentioned this had something

680
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:09,707
to do with that horrible
Karina Lewis murder?

681
00:27:09,731 --> 00:27:11,088
Yes.

682
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:12,641
Your boyfriend at the time, Ryan Jones,

683
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,436
he used to work with
Karina. Is that right?

684
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,644
Yes.

685
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:17,404
And according to your statement,

686
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:21,650
the night of the murder he
was with you having dinner.

687
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:24,411
Do you recall what time he arrived?

688
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:25,723
I don't know.

689
00:27:25,747 --> 00:27:28,623
Whatever I said back then must be right.

690
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,762
Well, you said 6:00 P.M.

691
00:27:29,786 --> 00:27:30,763
Ok.

692
00:27:30,787 --> 00:27:33,420
Then it was 6:00.

693
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:34,801
Why am I here?

694
00:27:34,825 --> 00:27:36,251
They caught the guy.

695
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:38,736
We actually have
new evidence indicating

696
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,324
that he might be innocent,

697
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:42,212
new evidence that implicates Ryan.

698
00:27:46,768 --> 00:27:49,782
He said it... it wasn't a big deal.

699
00:27:49,806 --> 00:27:52,888
He said that it would
make things easier if I just

700
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:55,788
said he was there at 6:00.

701
00:27:55,812 --> 00:27:59,067
What time did you actually
see Ryan that night?

702
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:01,759
Not until 9:00.

703
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:02,967
Officer thorsen?

704
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:03,968
A word.

705
00:28:03,992 --> 00:28:05,107
Yes, ma'am.

706
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:06,236
Excuse me.

707
00:28:10,585 --> 00:28:11,838
She just blew up Ryan's alibi.

708
00:28:11,862 --> 00:28:13,115
He's our guy.

709
00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:14,530
What are you doing interviewing

710
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:17,395
a witness without me?

711
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:18,465
I'm sorry.

712
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:19,950
I should have notified you.

713
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:21,227
Are you really this dense or are you just

714
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:22,642
actively trying to jam me up?

715
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,195
No, it's not about you.

716
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:26,059
This is about an innocent
man sitting in prison.

717
00:28:26,083 --> 00:28:29,200
Ok, listen, I know that this
case is personal for you.

718
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:31,720
But if you keep going rogue,

719
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:33,688
you are going to ruin this man's chances

720
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,000
of ever being released, ok?

721
00:28:36,024 --> 00:28:39,590
The paths to a new
trial are incredibly narrow

722
00:28:39,614 --> 00:28:41,834
and almost all procedural.

723
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:44,388
New evidence, even
overwhelming evidence,

724
00:28:44,412 --> 00:28:45,941
does not guarantee his release.

725
00:28:45,965 --> 00:28:46,942
Ok.

726
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:48,703
Well, that's not right.

727
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,739
No, it is not, but it is the
system that we are working in,

728
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,741
which means that every step needs

729
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:56,089
to be carefully considered.

730
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:57,677
Ok.

731
00:28:57,701 --> 00:29:01,198
Well, Ryan's girlfriend just
admitted to lying for him.

732
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:04,580
She didn't see him until 9:00 that night.

733
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:06,020
So what's our next step?

734
00:29:09,609 --> 00:29:10,690
Ok.

735
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,381
We... we need a murder weapon.

736
00:29:12,405 --> 00:29:15,039
If we can match the
ballistics from a .22 in Ryan's

737
00:29:15,063 --> 00:29:18,318
possession with the bullet
that the me found in Karina,

738
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:19,768
then we have a case.

739
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:22,529
But to get the gun, we
need probable cause

740
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:23,841
to get a warrant.

741
00:29:23,865 --> 00:29:26,005
And right now, we do not have that.

742
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:29,951
<i>Brenda's here.</i>

743
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:32,712
I wasn't even... sounds
like Teresa is here too.

744
00:29:32,736 --> 00:29:33,748
You liar.

745
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,783
You're my mom.

746
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:38,925
My fricking mom!

747
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:41,376
Control, 7-Adam-15 we have an on view

748
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,482
4-15 family at 1331 Arlington.

749
00:29:44,506 --> 00:29:45,760
You got her pregnant?

750
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,382
I thought you didn't even want kids.

751
00:29:47,406 --> 00:29:49,315
Honestly, I'm with Teresa at this point.

752
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,695
Right. It's just a bat.

753
00:29:50,719 --> 00:29:51,696
Let's split up.

754
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,697
I'm going to go around back.

755
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:53,698
Wait.

756
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:54,699
Look at her waistband.

757
00:29:54,723 --> 00:29:56,253
Come on, say that's enough.

758
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:57,599
All right, that changes things.

759
00:29:57,623 --> 00:29:59,014
She's enraged.

760
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:00,533
It's going to be hard
to get her to calm down.

761
00:30:00,557 --> 00:30:01,879
Get back to the cruiser.

762
00:30:01,903 --> 00:30:03,156
I want you to come racing in hot after 30

763
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,848
seconds, lights and sirens.

764
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:07,288
Copy that.

765
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:29,113
Augh!

766
00:30:29,137 --> 00:30:30,114
Police.

767
00:30:30,138 --> 00:30:31,702
You're under arrest.

768
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:35,913
And for the record, you
are a terrible mother.

769
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,846
Hey, my guy at state came through.

770
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,469
Diplomatic plates we sent him
belong to the Turkish embassy,

771
00:30:40,493 --> 00:30:42,230
but the guy in the car wasn't Turkish.

772
00:30:42,254 --> 00:30:43,783
He was Venezuelan.

773
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:45,958
Gustav Martinez, military
counterintelligence.

774
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:47,925
Specialty is cracking
down on anyone considered

775
00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:49,064
an enemy of the state.

776
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,583
Dissidents.

777
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:52,757
If ray met with Gustav,
it had to be for a job.

778
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:54,035
Makes sense.

779
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:55,795
Gustav can't operate domestically,

780
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:57,901
so he hires ray to kidnap
or kill anyone on the outs

781
00:30:57,925 --> 00:30:59,557
at home.

782
00:30:59,581 --> 00:31:00,869
According to my guy,
the most likely candidate

783
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:03,827
is Elena a cost a, <i>political activist.</i>

784
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:07,669
Hello?

785
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:09,291
<i>This is sergeant Tim
Bradford with the LAPD.</i>

786
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:12,743
We just received a
credible threat on your life.

787
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:14,055
They're here.

788
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:15,263
Yell the name ray Watkins right now.

789
00:31:15,287 --> 00:31:17,058
- Do it.
- Ray Watkins.

790
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:20,751
Ray Watkins. Ray Watkins.

791
00:31:20,775 --> 00:31:22,615
No.

792
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:25,100
Ray Watkins.

793
00:31:25,124 --> 00:31:26,481
Hey, Tim.

794
00:31:26,505 --> 00:31:28,138
<i>We know about the Venezuelans, ray,</i>

795
00:31:28,162 --> 00:31:29,691
<i>so let Elena go right
now, and I'll push the da's</i>

796
00:31:29,715 --> 00:31:31,451
<i>office to go easy on you.</i>

797
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:34,247
Sorry, buddy, I got a job to
do and a reputation to uphold.

798
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:35,973
We're gonna have
to let this one play out.

799
00:31:35,997 --> 00:31:38,172
Catch me if you can.

800
00:31:44,178 --> 00:31:45,776
All right, put her inside.

801
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,527
I'll let Neil know the
container is ready to load.

802
00:31:59,676 --> 00:32:00,619
- Get on the ground.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

803
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:02,517
Now.

804
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,450
- It's over, ray.
- Stop.

805
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:06,038
Show me your hands right now.

806
00:32:06,062 --> 00:32:07,625
Got your entire crew in custody.

807
00:32:07,649 --> 00:32:09,524
Should have changed it up
after you caught me following you.

808
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:11,975
Yeah, I get a little cocky sometimes.

809
00:32:11,999 --> 00:32:14,667
I didn't know you'd be on me this early.

810
00:32:14,691 --> 00:32:18,567
You know killing me
is your only play here.

811
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:21,363
I'm not going to kill you, ray.

812
00:32:21,387 --> 00:32:25,150
And there's no air strike
you can call in this time.

813
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:28,025
Are you kidding?

814
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:31,201
I am the air strike.

815
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:34,273
I'm about to blow up your whole life.

816
00:32:34,297 --> 00:32:36,931
Sergeant Bradford, this is a dii,

817
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,588
or department initiated investigation,

818
00:32:39,612 --> 00:32:41,901
which could result in discipline.

819
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:44,697
Your continued
employment with the LAPD

820
00:32:44,721 --> 00:32:48,045
is contingent on your
full and truthful answers

821
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:49,598
to my questions.

822
00:32:49,622 --> 00:32:50,599
I understand.

823
00:32:50,623 --> 00:32:52,049
I want to be clear.

824
00:32:52,073 --> 00:32:53,568
Other people will deal with your crimes.

825
00:32:53,592 --> 00:32:55,673
I'm not questioning you as a suspect.

826
00:32:55,697 --> 00:32:59,229
My job is to investigate your accusations

827
00:32:59,253 --> 00:33:00,989
against sergeant Bradford.

828
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:03,371
On that point, I am crystal clear.

829
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:07,823
When did you become aware
that ray Watkins was alive?

830
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:08,928
Last week.

831
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:10,412
I saw him entering a 7-Eleven.

832
00:33:10,436 --> 00:33:14,244
Bradford and Mark
greer tracked me down,

833
00:33:14,268 --> 00:33:15,970
threatened me in my mother's home.

834
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,799
Was your mother there to witness that?

835
00:33:17,823 --> 00:33:20,457
Yeah, but she's in the hospital.

836
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:22,942
Doctors say it will be a
miracle if she wakes up.

837
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:23,978
I'm sorry.

838
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,945
Don't be.

839
00:33:25,969 --> 00:33:27,360
But Mark, he was there.

840
00:33:27,384 --> 00:33:31,675
I haven't seen Mark greer in a decade.

841
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:33,470
I still get the occasional Christmas card.

842
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:36,231
According to the faa,
there's no record of Mark

843
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:38,061
greer flying into Los Angeles.

844
00:33:38,085 --> 00:33:40,477
No local credit card charges.

845
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:43,100
His phone never left
Arlington, and the army

846
00:33:43,124 --> 00:33:46,759
shows him as on base
for the entire two weeks.

847
00:33:46,783 --> 00:33:48,381
Clever man.

848
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:50,245
He was planning to kill
me, so he covered his tracks.

849
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:52,937
Did I conspire to
commit murder with a guy

850
00:33:52,961 --> 00:33:54,491
I haven't seen in ten years?

851
00:33:54,515 --> 00:33:55,492
No.

852
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:57,218
So ray Watkins is lying.

853
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:59,703
Little tip when dealing with
ray, if his lips are moving,

854
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:01,049
he's lying.

855
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:03,086
Tim lied on the after action report.

856
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:06,123
He said I was killed in action.

857
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:07,331
I look dead to you?

858
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:08,815
Why would I lie?

859
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,196
My whole squad had
been hit with friendly fire.

860
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,439
I had lost three of my men.

861
00:34:11,463 --> 00:34:13,027
Technically, two.

862
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,788
Right, but I didn't know
that until a few days ago.

863
00:34:15,812 --> 00:34:16,858
And it shook me.

864
00:34:16,882 --> 00:34:18,618
Ray Watkins was awol.

865
00:34:18,642 --> 00:34:22,277
Why not contact military police
when you learned he was alive?

866
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:24,141
I wanted to be sure
before I sounded the alarm.

867
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:25,522
Here's the truth.

868
00:34:25,546 --> 00:34:27,524
Bradford wanted to protect his career,

869
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:29,802
so he lied about what actually happened.

870
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:33,702
He participated in a
cover-up, and he knowingly

871
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:35,808
falsified official reports.

872
00:34:35,832 --> 00:34:37,637
These are serious accusations.

873
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:40,630
Is any part of what ray said true?

874
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:43,195
No.

875
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,254
None of it.

876
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:03,111
Hi.

877
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:04,871
Excuse me?

878
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,425
Hi.

879
00:35:06,449 --> 00:35:11,188
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
but what are you using?

880
00:35:11,212 --> 00:35:13,087
44 Magnum.

881
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,675
Is it heavy?

882
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:18,230
You tell me.

883
00:35:18,254 --> 00:35:23,131
Wow, you must be
really strong to hold that.

884
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:24,132
I lift.

885
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,513
Ok.

886
00:35:25,537 --> 00:35:27,480
So I am trying to decide on what to buy,

887
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:29,379
and I want something that's light

888
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:31,381
but still, like, accurate.

889
00:35:31,405 --> 00:35:34,280
38 is a good option.

890
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:36,110
Ok, I've heard of that.

891
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:41,460
A friend of mine, she has a
.22 rutger, and she loves it.

892
00:35:41,484 --> 00:35:45,119
She says it's light enough
to hold in her purse.

893
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,603
Ruger.

894
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:49,778
A ruger. Right.

895
00:35:49,802 --> 00:35:51,297
Yeah.

896
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:54,749
22 is a good choice for a
delicate woman like you.

897
00:35:54,773 --> 00:35:55,991
No recoil.

898
00:35:56,015 --> 00:35:58,270
Ok.

899
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:00,513
Do you have one I could try?

900
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:04,552
Please?

901
00:36:04,576 --> 00:36:05,553
Yeah, sure.

902
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:06,588
I have a few with me.

903
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:08,304
Yeah. Ok.

904
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,148
Thank you.

905
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,149
Wow.

906
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,219
That is super light.

907
00:36:16,243 --> 00:36:17,220
Can I?

908
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:19,625
Yeah? Ok.

909
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:40,864
So I had a chance to look
over the ballistics report.

910
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:43,280
The bullets that you collected
are a match for the bullet

911
00:36:43,304 --> 00:36:45,109
that killed Karina Lewis.

912
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:46,870
An arrest warrant has been approved,

913
00:36:46,894 --> 00:36:49,666
and I will be signing a
motion to vacate the conviction.

914
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,943
Really?

915
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:52,255
Yeah, I wouldn't have prosecuted if we'd

916
00:36:52,279 --> 00:36:53,428
had this evidence at the time.

917
00:36:53,452 --> 00:36:54,464
That's awesome.

918
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:55,948
No.

919
00:36:55,972 --> 00:36:57,536
I probably shouldn't hug you, right?

920
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,778
Right.

921
00:36:58,802 --> 00:36:59,883
Let us know if you need anything.

922
00:36:59,907 --> 00:37:00,884
Will do.

923
00:37:00,908 --> 00:37:02,368
And thank you.

924
00:37:02,392 --> 00:37:03,404
No.

925
00:37:03,428 --> 00:37:05,716
Thank you for sticking with it.

926
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,914
Good job.

927
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:11,308
And your campaign?

928
00:37:11,332 --> 00:37:14,346
Well, doing the right thing,
no matter how difficult,

929
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,832
should be seen as a
character strength, not a flaw.

930
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:19,143
Nice.

931
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:20,628
You float that one by the advisors yet?

932
00:37:20,652 --> 00:37:21,870
Damn right I did, and they loved it.

933
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:22,906
I bet they did.

934
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,494
Big plans this weekend?

935
00:37:24,518 --> 00:37:28,498
Hide in my room, wear
blinders to the kitchen.

936
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:29,982
I need to move?

937
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:31,294
Definitely.

938
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:32,847
What about you?

939
00:37:32,871 --> 00:37:34,297
What's going on with
the whole, baby situation?

940
00:37:34,321 --> 00:37:35,539
Mostly I've just been avoiding

941
00:37:35,563 --> 00:37:38,232
thinking about it all day.

942
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,855
And now?

943
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:48,266
And now, having a kid...

944
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:53,478
Has been the greatest joy of my life.

945
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,103
So why would I want to deny her that?

946
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:03,912
In light of Ray's numerous crimes,

947
00:38:03,936 --> 00:38:07,502
his statements against you
appear retaliatory in nature.

948
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:09,573
Because your after action reports

949
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:13,197
have been accepted as
factual by your military superiors,

950
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:16,097
which there's no evidence
to suggest otherwise,

951
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:21,506
this dii is closed with a
finding of not sustained.

952
00:38:22,265 --> 00:38:24,795
Thank you, sir.

953
00:38:24,819 --> 00:38:26,590
- Always a pleasure.
- Yeah.

954
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:28,420
We should get the wives together soon,

955
00:38:28,444 --> 00:38:29,455
have some dinner.

956
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:30,653
I would love that.

957
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,049
You know this isn't over.

958
00:38:37,073 --> 00:38:38,395
I know.

959
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:40,294
You violated procedure
in pursuit of a suspect

960
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,192
and roped in two other officers?

961
00:38:42,216 --> 00:38:45,160
What if Ms. Acosta had been killed

962
00:38:45,184 --> 00:38:48,440
because you didn't utilize
proper channels and resources?

963
00:38:48,464 --> 00:38:49,441
It was wrong.

964
00:38:49,465 --> 00:38:50,821
I know.

965
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:53,824
I'm required to notify
your Metro commander.

966
00:38:53,848 --> 00:38:55,412
What she does with it is up to her.

967
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:57,611
- Sir...
- you're dismissed.

968
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:12,557
Come here.

969
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:19,218
How did it go with ia?

970
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:25,880
I lied about everything.

971
00:39:27,468 --> 00:39:32,035
But I mean, it saved my job, right?

972
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:33,381
Protected you and Lopez.

973
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:36,660
It was an impossible situation.

974
00:39:36,684 --> 00:39:40,112
I would have done the same
thing if I was in your place.

975
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:43,080
You wouldn't have been in my place.

976
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:46,049
You never would have put
self-interest over your team.

977
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:47,671
You thought you could handle it.

978
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:51,019
You were wrong, but you
made it right, so it's fine.

979
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:54,954
Yeah. I wish it was that easy.

980
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:59,442
Lucy, I just lied to two
men I deeply respect, ok?

981
00:39:59,466 --> 00:40:01,478
I just betrayed everything I thought

982
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:02,859
- was right about myself.
- Tim.

983
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:03,894
No, no.

984
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:05,171
You got to let me finish, ok?

985
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:06,172
This is very hard for me to say.

986
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,071
Ok.

987
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:12,306
Lucy, I've been lying
to myself for a long time.

988
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,043
That's clear to me now, and I can't

989
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:19,807
I can't just go back
to the way things were.

990
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:22,810
Not right now.

991
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:25,043
Maybe never.

992
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:30,473
Wait.

993
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:32,533
Are you breaking up with me?

994
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:38,446
I'm sorry.

995
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:41,000
You don't... you don't get to do that.

996
00:40:41,024 --> 00:40:46,212
You don't get to lie to me
and then use that as an excuse

997
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,042
to leave me, ok?

998
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:50,354
- That's not ok.
- I know.

999
00:40:50,378 --> 00:40:52,080
- I know.
- What you're doing is not ok.

1000
00:40:52,104 --> 00:40:54,220
I know.

1001
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:57,707
You... you are an incredible person.

1002
00:40:57,731 --> 00:40:58,708
No.

1003
00:40:58,732 --> 00:41:01,158
No, you're incredible, ok?

1004
00:41:01,182 --> 00:41:03,126
You deserve so much better.

1005
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:06,854
My god.

1006
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:07,924
That's why I'm walking away.

1007
00:41:07,948 --> 00:41:08,925
Don't do this.

1008
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:13,239
Why are you doing this?

1009
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,299
I'm sorry.

1010
00:41:33,387 --> 00:41:35,330
Are you learning baby sign language?

1011
00:41:35,354 --> 00:41:36,424
Maybe.

1012
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:41,544
How about we just
forget about the elephant

1013
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:44,374
in the room for tonight,
make some dinner,

1014
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:46,790
and enjoy some time together?

1015
00:41:46,814 --> 00:41:50,069
I think that's a great idea.

1016
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:52,071
But you may want to lay
off the wine if I'm going to get

1017
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:53,338
you pregnant later tonight.

1018
00:41:55,858 --> 00:41:57,491
Is that what we're doing?

1019
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:01,080
Yes, with much enthusiasm.

1020
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:04,049
Are you sure?

1021
00:42:04,073 --> 00:42:06,534
Hydrating.

1022
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:08,767
Do we have to wait till after dinner?

1023
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:11,459
Nope.

1024
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,786
Grab my water.

1025
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,442
Thank you.

1026
00:42:18,466 --> 00:42:19,916
You're in trouble.

1027
00:42:55,814 --> 00:42:56,850
<i>Damn it.</i>
