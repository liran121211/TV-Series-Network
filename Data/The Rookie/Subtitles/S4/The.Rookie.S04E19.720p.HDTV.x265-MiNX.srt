1
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:15,498
Ahh.

2
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,814
Hey.
Oh.

3
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:29,338
Hey.

4
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:32,907
Come look at this.

5
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,822
Never seen
anything like it.

6
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:40,175
Um...

7
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:42,221
No, thanks.
Come on.

8
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:45,615
I don't know
what the hell it is.

9
00:00:46,834 --> 00:00:48,575
Wow, thanks for waiting.

10
00:00:48,618 --> 00:00:50,446
Hey, hey, hey.

11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,448
Luther, cool it.
Sorry.

12
00:00:52,492 --> 00:00:53,928
He's usually
such a sweetheart.

13
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,061
Hey, let's go.
Wait, we just got up here.

14
00:00:56,104 --> 00:00:57,105
Ow!
What is going on?

15
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,802
That guy
is serial-killer creepy.

16
00:00:58,846 --> 00:01:01,588
Like, he tried to get me
to go inside with him.

17
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:03,242
I'm calling 911.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,683
It's Bailey's
Army Reserve week.

19
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:10,901
How's being
a bachelor going?

20
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,207
Oh, I hate it.

21
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:14,079
House is too quiet.

22
00:01:14,122 --> 00:01:16,211
Keep making an extra cup of
coffee for her without thinking.

23
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:18,213
I-I did laundry
last night...

24
00:01:18,257 --> 00:01:20,259
Not a single, weird,
frilly thing

25
00:01:20,302 --> 00:01:22,043
that I don't know how to fold
anyway.

26
00:01:22,087 --> 00:01:23,566
Kinda sounds like
you guys live together.

27
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,828
Whoa! No!

28
00:01:24,872 --> 00:01:26,134
No, we're not ready
for that.

29
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:27,918
She just stays over
sometimes.

30
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:29,572
A... A lot of times.

31
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:33,228
Oh, my God. Did we accidentally
move in together?

32
00:01:33,272 --> 00:01:34,708
7-Adam-15,
we have reports

33
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:36,666
of suspicious activity
in Griffith Park,

34
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,407
near the DWP relay station.

35
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:40,017
7-Adam-15,
show us responding.

36
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:45,110
It's great that you guys
are so happy again.

37
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:46,415
What is it they say?

38
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:47,851
If you can survive
a secret marriage,

39
00:01:47,895 --> 00:01:49,244
you can survive
anything?

40
00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:50,245
Whoa.

41
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:56,469
7-Adam-15 on site.
Signs of forced entry.

42
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:57,687
We're gonna go in
and check it out.

43
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:25,498
Lucy.

44
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:26,499
Move!

45
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:52,481
Captions by VITAC...

46
00:02:57,007 --> 00:02:58,226
You sure you're okay?

47
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,706
Yes, sir.
Just a little banged up.

48
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:01,490
That explosion took out power
to most of the Valley.

49
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:03,927
Gonna take at least 12 hours
to restore it.

50
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,668
Here come the feds.

51
00:03:11,935 --> 00:03:13,241
Matt,
how have you been?

52
00:03:13,285 --> 00:03:15,069
Me? Anxious.

53
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,679
We've been hearing rumors
about a potential terror attack

54
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:18,551
for weeks,
and now it's happened.

55
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:19,987
Have you met Agent Fox?

56
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,641
No. Wade Grey.
Casey Fox.

57
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:24,034
That's Sergeant Bradford,
Officers Nolan and Chen.

58
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,862
Clearly, you're the ones
who found the bomb.

59
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,429
Can you describe it?

60
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,126
Not really.
All I saw was a timer,

61
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,041
some wires, and then I was
running for my life.

62
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,696
Same, but my impression was that
it was fairly rudimentary.

63
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,220
Well, the bomb guys
will get in there.

64
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:36,264
They'll take a look
once it's safe,

65
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:37,613
and hopefully
there's something left

66
00:03:37,657 --> 00:03:39,441
that we can trace back
to a source.

67
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,835
Of all the targets in the city,
why hit this place?

68
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:43,880
I mean, there's no potential
for casualties.

69
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:45,839
All they can do is knock out
power to the Valley.

70
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:47,275
I don't know yet,

71
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,842
but there is a possibility
that this attack

72
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:50,278
is only the beginning,

73
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:51,888
which is why the FBI
is taking over.

74
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,586
Matt, this guy almost killed
two of my officers.

75
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:55,283
We're not just gonna stand
on the sidelines.

76
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,114
Okay.

77
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,550
Let's "Super Friends"
the investigation...

78
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:03,552
Joint task force.
The first thing we need to do

79
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:06,163
is talk to all the witnesses
who called 911.

80
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:07,295
Thanks for riding
with me today.

81
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:08,688
Yeah, of course.

82
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:10,472
I'm happy to keep filling in
on the detective side.

83
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:11,865
Because it keeps you out
of uniform.

84
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:13,301
God, yes.

85
00:04:13,345 --> 00:04:15,260
I feel like I'm already,
like, 90 months pregnant.

86
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:18,306
What?!

87
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,614
Uh, Professor Meadows,
I am Detective Harper.

88
00:04:21,657 --> 00:04:23,311
This is Detective Lopez.

89
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:24,747
You called about
an intruder.

90
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,228
Yes. Yes.
Thank you for coming.

91
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:33,365
I woke up in the middle
of the night,

92
00:04:33,408 --> 00:04:34,540
and there was someone
in my bedroom.

93
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,889
Can you describe him?

94
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:37,847
I can do better.
I sketched him.

95
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:42,504
Now, where did I put
that drawing?

96
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,201
Uh, he was an alien.

97
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:47,466
I can... tell you that much
to start.

98
00:04:47,509 --> 00:04:49,424
You could tell
he was undocumented

99
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:50,947
just by looking
at him?

100
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:53,298
No, no, no, no,
not that kind of alien.

101
00:04:53,341 --> 00:04:54,908
No, he was, uh...

102
00:04:54,951 --> 00:04:56,910
Oh.

103
00:04:56,953 --> 00:04:59,347
He was a Heptapod.

104
00:04:59,391 --> 00:05:01,175
With cosmically
awful breath.

105
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:05,832
Oh, and, um, how do you know
it was a he?

106
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:08,791
Well, it was more
of a feeling I got.

107
00:05:08,835 --> 00:05:11,794
I-I certainly didn't see
any external genitalia,

108
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:13,753
or I would have put it
in the sketch.

109
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:15,711
Mr. Meadows, are you on
any medications?

110
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:17,670
Why does everyone
always ask me that?

111
00:05:17,713 --> 00:05:19,802
Listen to me.

112
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:23,806
An alien broke into my house
and stole my manuscript...

113
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,157
Thedefinitive treatise
on Los Angeles traffic patterns.

114
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,639
Why would an alien
travel across the galaxy

115
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:33,207
for a book on traffic?

116
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,558
Understanding traffic is the key
to human colonization.

117
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,386
Right.
Of course.

118
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,216
You... You think I'm crazy,
but I-I can prove it happened.

119
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,175
The alien attacked me.

120
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,569
I only survived because
I managed to lock myself

121
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,788
in the bathroom.

122
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,359
He's white, dark hair,
30s.

123
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:55,621
With a scar
under his left eye.

124
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:56,665
And he had an accent.

125
00:05:56,709 --> 00:05:58,580
Um... couldn't quite
place it.

126
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,016
Well, it was Russian.

127
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,844
Yeah, he sounded just like
Vladislav Ivanov.

128
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:03,455
Who?
Lelush.

129
00:06:05,544 --> 00:06:07,154
The super-hot model
who was trapped

130
00:06:07,197 --> 00:06:09,635
on that Chinese
reality singing show. I mean...

131
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:12,159
Can that be right? Oh,
yeah, Lelush is super cute.

132
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:13,900
No, I mean, the...

133
00:06:13,943 --> 00:06:16,293
We need to pull them out.

134
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:18,774
TID got a partial on a piece
of the explosive device.

135
00:06:18,818 --> 00:06:21,298
Prints came back
for an Ezekiel Freemont.

136
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:23,039
That is not
a scar-faced Russian.

137
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:25,041
So we could be dealing
with a terror cell.

138
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,535
Police!

139
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:49,457
Clear!

140
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:50,850
All clear.
He's not here.

141
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:52,939
Okay, now we go
into manhunt mode.

142
00:06:52,982 --> 00:06:54,897
Let's get a BOLO going,
and I want agents

143
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:57,291
on the doorstep of everyone
that this guy has ever known

144
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,553
by sundown.

145
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:03,558
So, small world.

146
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:05,908
Turns out, our suspect's
high school guidance counselor,

147
00:07:05,952 --> 00:07:07,475
Simone Clark,
is currently a trainee

148
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,216
at the FBI Academy
at Quantico.

149
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:10,652
So let's get her here
ASAP.

150
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,669
Drifting is not
proper FBI technique!

151
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:31,499
Hey... Oh. Aah!

152
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:38,550
What? Hey... Oh.

153
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:45,774
Whoo!

154
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:47,559
Trainee, pursuit
is passing you!

155
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:48,908
Oh, no.

156
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,389
Here we go.

157
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:11,017
FBI!
Out of the car!

158
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,976
On the ground!
On your stomach! Do it now!

159
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:21,244
How'd I do?

160
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:22,550
Pretty good, right?

161
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:30,297
Where the hell did you learn
to drive like that?

162
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,994
Claybourne High School
in D.C.

163
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:34,649
I was a guidance counselor there
for 20 years.

164
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:37,522
Taught Driver's Ed for
eight of 'em, till they realized

165
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:40,263
I was using the time to teach
myself and my students

166
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:42,222
advanced
driving techniques.

167
00:08:42,265 --> 00:08:44,529
I also coached
the wrestling team

168
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:47,444
'cause I wanted to perfect
my hand-to-hand fighting style

169
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:50,970
so I could pursue my dream
of becoming an FBI Agent.

170
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:54,408
That's a... fun story.

171
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:57,019
But the FBI has a very specific
way of doing things,

172
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,065
and a 50-year-old...
48.

173
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:00,893
48-year-old
former high school teacher

174
00:09:00,936 --> 00:09:05,767
with a "Fast & Furious" fetish
doesn't really fit our model.

175
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:08,465
Did I make a single mistake
on the driving course?

176
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:10,206
No.

177
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,339
Did I successfully
pit-maneuver this car

178
00:09:12,382 --> 00:09:14,428
and put the suspect
under arrest?

179
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:15,821
Yes.

180
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:18,301
Alright, then I don't understand
what the problem is.

181
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:21,653
Trainee... you are trying
to succeed at an agency

182
00:09:21,696 --> 00:09:25,482
where J. Edgar Hoover once fired
an agent for having acne.

183
00:09:25,526 --> 00:09:28,181
You're either FBI material
or you're not.

184
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:37,930
Simone Clark?
Yes, sir.

185
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:40,541
Do you remember a student named
Ezekiel Freemont?

186
00:09:40,585 --> 00:09:42,238
Zeke. Yes, sir.

187
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,198
He's the main suspect in
a terror attack in Los Angeles.

188
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,635
You're going to L.A. to brief
investigative agents

189
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,941
on Mr. Freemont.

190
00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:49,811
Happy to help, sir.

191
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:54,120
Have yourself
a very good day... sir.

192
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:55,164
Let's go, Clark.

193
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:06,959
Based on his history,
our suspect clearly shares

194
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:08,874
several personality traits
with Ted Kaczynski,

195
00:10:08,917 --> 00:10:10,223
otherwise known
as the Unabomber.

196
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:28,676
Whoops.
Don't mind me.

197
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,852
I... I'm just gonna
tuck in over here.

198
00:10:32,724 --> 00:10:34,682
Ooh.
Excuse me, handsome.

199
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:37,250
No problem.

200
00:10:37,293 --> 00:10:39,731
As I was saying,
Ezekiel Freemont fits

201
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:42,516
the classic mold of a high-IQ,
low-empathy psychopath.

202
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,823
No,
that's not right.

203
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,128
Did you say something?

204
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:47,782
No, no, no.
Keep goin'.

205
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:52,091
Becoming a bomber speaks
to his deep sense of anger

206
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:53,483
and his impotency.

207
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,702
But social and sexual
tendencies...

208
00:10:54,746 --> 00:10:56,095
Oh, Lord.
Excuse me.

209
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:57,400
This is... Who are you?

210
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:59,968
I'm Simone Clark.

211
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:02,492
I-I just flew in
from the Academy.

212
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:05,147
I was Zeke's guidance counselor
for three years in D.C.

213
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:07,976
Right. Step out so everybody
can see you.

214
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:11,937
You clearly disagree
with Marlin's profile.

215
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,288
I just don't recognize
the kid he's describing.

216
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:17,246
Zeke grew up
in a violent home.

217
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:19,771
Had sensory-overload issues
because of it.

218
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:22,991
But I found him to be
a deeply empathetic person

219
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:24,732
who isolated himself
from others

220
00:11:24,776 --> 00:11:27,387
as a protection mechanism.

221
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,389
With all due respect,
you're a guidance counselor.

222
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:31,957
I'm a trained
behavioral scientist

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,567
with three decades'
experience.

224
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,744
And I got mad respect for you,
even if you don't appreciate

225
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:39,486
what a good guidance counselor
brings to the table.

226
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:42,576
I've worked with literally
thousands of young men and women

227
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,230
at their
most formative age,

228
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:47,581
from future criminals
to future millionaires

229
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,409
and everything
in between,

230
00:11:49,452 --> 00:11:51,628
and that made me
an expert on people.

231
00:11:51,672 --> 00:11:52,978
Where do you think Zeke
is hiding right now?

232
00:11:53,021 --> 00:11:55,545
Some place dark and quiet.

233
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,504
When the world
got overwhelming,

234
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:59,767
he just went some place
to hide.

235
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:02,335
He feels safest
underground.

236
00:12:02,378 --> 00:12:04,511
Thank you for your insight,
Trainee Clark,

237
00:12:04,554 --> 00:12:07,732
but I'm gonna trust our profiler
on this one.

238
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:10,865
The guy that you knew in D.C.,
he's no longer the same guy.

239
00:12:10,909 --> 00:12:13,346
We think that he's part
of a terrorist cell

240
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:15,435
intending to strike this city
again.

241
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:17,263
And we need to catch him
before they set off a bomb...

242
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:18,917
One that kills innocent people
this time.

243
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,266
So let's get to work.

244
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:33,932
Um... I just want to say, I am so
sorry for speaking out of turn.

245
00:12:33,975 --> 00:12:37,283
So, w-what can I do now?
I mean, how can I help?

246
00:12:37,326 --> 00:12:39,459
Y-You can't.

247
00:12:39,502 --> 00:12:40,895
You should just go back
to the Academy.

248
00:12:40,939 --> 00:12:42,854
The travel office
is on the fourth floor.

249
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:45,030
They'll give you a voucher for
a coach seat back to Virginia.

250
00:12:45,073 --> 00:12:47,162
So, no private jet?

251
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,077
Pr...

252
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:50,949
Je... No.

253
00:12:50,992 --> 00:12:52,037
Excuse me.

254
00:13:01,742 --> 00:13:04,571
That was pretty brave,
the way you spoke up in there.

255
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,924
Thank you, but I don't think
I did myself any favors.

256
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:11,970
John Nolan.
Simone Clark.

257
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:14,886
Did you hang back 'cause you
wanted to get my phone number?

258
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:16,801
No, ma'am.
Just to tell you,

259
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:18,933
I think they were wrong to
dismiss your insight so quickly.

260
00:13:18,977 --> 00:13:20,369
You're the only one
in that room

261
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:22,415
who actually knows
our Mr. Freemont.

262
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,678
In my book, that makes you
the only real expert.

263
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,593
Ooh. Keep talkin'.

264
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:28,290
Well, if you're not in a rush
to get back to Quantico,

265
00:13:28,334 --> 00:13:30,075
how would you like to ride
with me the rest of my shift,

266
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:31,380
help us find our suspect?

267
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:35,863
I'd love to.

268
00:13:35,907 --> 00:13:37,038
This way.

269
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:40,737
How long you been
on the job?

270
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,087
Only a couple years.

271
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,307
I was just the oldest rookie
in the LAPD.

272
00:13:45,351 --> 00:13:47,179
What? That's funny

273
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:50,791
because I'm the oldest trainee
at the Academy.

274
00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:54,012
So, why'd you change course
and sign up?

275
00:13:54,055 --> 00:13:56,753
Found myself in the middle
of a bank robbery.

276
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:58,277
What? Helping the
people on the inside

277
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,756
made me want to do
more of it.

278
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,367
What about yourself?

279
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,673
I've always wanted to be
an FBI agent,

280
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,111
but I ended up on an off-ramp
when I found out

281
00:14:06,154 --> 00:14:08,069
I was pregnant
with the twins.

282
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:12,552
They in college now, so time for
Mama to finish what she started.

283
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:13,945
It's not easy, though,
trying to keep up

284
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,511
with these 20-somethings.

285
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:16,861
Sheesh.

286
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:19,167
Every day, I am determined
to beat them,

287
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:22,170
and every night, I crawl into
bed feeling beaten.

288
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:26,000
Can I offer you
some hard-won advice?

289
00:14:26,044 --> 00:14:27,697
Please.

290
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,786
You are never gonna beat them
at being 20-something.

291
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,397
But what you lack
in flexibility

292
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,225
or the ability to run up
a flight of stairs

293
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:34,879
without getting winded...

294
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:38,012
you more than make up for
in life experience.

295
00:14:38,056 --> 00:14:41,015
And that puts you way ahead of
the curve, day one on the job.

296
00:14:43,322 --> 00:14:45,541
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

297
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:46,978
Anytime.

298
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,026
Alright.

299
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,160
This is the closest tunnel
to Zeke's apartment.

300
00:14:55,203 --> 00:14:57,249
I'll go check it out.
I'mma come with you.

301
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,077
No, it's not safe.
You're not even armed.

302
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,861
I'm telling you,
I know this kid.

303
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:02,689
He's not
a violent person.

304
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:04,952
And the bomb that nearly
killed me says differently.

305
00:15:04,996 --> 00:15:06,475
Well...
Stay here.

306
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:44,296
7-Adam-15, I have eyes
on our bombing suspect.

307
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:45,819
Heading east
toward King Street.

308
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,604
Zeke. Zeke!

309
00:16:00,703 --> 00:16:02,009
Don't even think
about it.

310
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:03,663
I got him.

311
00:16:05,317 --> 00:16:07,014
Did you just steal
my police vehicle?

312
00:16:07,058 --> 00:16:10,148
No. I borrowed it
to catch a fleeing suspect.

313
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:11,845
You're welcome.

314
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,413
Miss Clark, is that you?

315
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:16,502
Yes, honey.

316
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:18,330
Please don't let that man
kill me.

317
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:21,594
What man?

318
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:14,001
I know that look.
He's overloaded, shuttin' down.

319
00:17:14,444 --> 00:17:17,143
If he wasn't handcuffed to
that table, he'd be under it.

320
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:20,284
Shouldn't you be on a plane
to Virginia?

321
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:23,687
Oh, that's my fault.
I asked her to stay.

322
00:17:23,731 --> 00:17:25,820
W-Without Simone, we wouldn't
have our suspect in custody.

323
00:17:25,863 --> 00:17:27,387
Well, I'm glad
that she was of service.

324
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,171
But tell me something, Trainee,
in the Bureau,

325
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,738
what are you taught to do
when given an order?

326
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:32,783
Follow it, sir,
to the letter.

327
00:17:32,827 --> 00:17:35,569
Matt, considering her
relationship with the suspect,

328
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:37,788
we were thinking that she should
take point on the interview.

329
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:39,660
Absolutely not.

330
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,618
She's a NAT, nowhere even close
to being qualified.

331
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:44,839
Agent Fox is right. We'll
conduct the interview ourselves.

332
00:17:44,882 --> 00:17:47,973
Get yourself back to Quantico
now, while you can.

333
00:17:49,844 --> 00:17:52,368
Mr. Freemont...

334
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:54,022
we're with the FBI.

335
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:56,155
You are in a lot of trouble.

336
00:17:56,198 --> 00:17:58,722
I'll, um, walk you out.

337
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,248
If you need any recommendations
on places to eat

338
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,727
before your flight...

339
00:18:03,771 --> 00:18:05,903
Thanks, but I know
all the good spots.

340
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:08,428
At least, I used to.
I grew up here.

341
00:18:08,471 --> 00:18:11,039
Really? Any family you want
to see before you leave?

342
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:13,999
None that wants to see me.

343
00:18:14,042 --> 00:18:15,826
Trainee, hold up!

344
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,350
Suspect says
he'll only talk to you.

345
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:23,443
Can we lose
the shackles?

346
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:24,618
Yes, of course.

347
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:26,359
Hey, Zeke.

348
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:28,883
It's me...
Miss Clark.

349
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:30,624
Remember to breathe,
okay?

350
00:18:33,105 --> 00:18:37,283
When I first met Zeke, he was
really struggling in school.

351
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,721
Every day, he was either
acting out,

352
00:18:40,764 --> 00:18:43,463
freaking out,
or zoning out.

353
00:18:43,506 --> 00:18:45,813
But then we spent
some time together,

354
00:18:45,856 --> 00:18:48,163
and I realized he just needed
help transitioning

355
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:49,947
from the chaos at home.

356
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:53,429
So I told him to come
in my office every morning.

357
00:18:53,473 --> 00:18:55,127
And what did you say?

358
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,000
That I didn't wanna
talk.

359
00:18:59,044 --> 00:19:00,262
Mm-hmm, that's right.

360
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,872
And I told him
he didn't have to.

361
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,918
He could use that time
to get quiet.

362
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,399
And that's what we did.

363
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:09,576
Every day for two years,
he would come to my office,

364
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:13,884
sit for 15 minutes,
then go to class.

365
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:17,018
And who became
an "A" student?

366
00:19:17,062 --> 00:19:20,108
Yeah, after a few weeks,
she bought me an MP3 player

367
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:22,763
and some headphones so I could
listen to music in the morning.

368
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:24,112
Mm-hmm.

369
00:19:26,506 --> 00:19:28,116
I'm in real trouble, huh?

370
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,032
I'm afraid you are.

371
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:34,383
What can you tell us about the
man with the scar on his face?

372
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:37,125
I don't know who he is,
I swear.

373
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:39,954
I needed money, so I've been
selling my engineering skills

374
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:41,173
on the dark web.

375
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:42,565
He paid you to build a bomb
for him?

376
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:43,610
No,
just the detonators.

377
00:19:43,653 --> 00:19:46,091
Detonators?

378
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:49,268
As in, more than one?

379
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:53,141
I made him six,
along with a regular timer

380
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:54,925
and five with GPS triggers.

381
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:56,188
T-Those are special.

382
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:58,538
I-I-I built them
so they'd go off

383
00:19:58,581 --> 00:20:00,757
when they reach a programmed set
of coordinates.

384
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:01,932
And what were
the coordinates?

385
00:20:01,976 --> 00:20:03,369
Oh, he didn't tell me.

386
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,719
I-I-I gave him
the instructions

387
00:20:05,762 --> 00:20:07,590
on how to program them in
himself.

388
00:20:07,634 --> 00:20:09,679
You knowingly helped
a terrorist?

389
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:11,333
He said he was
a research scientist

390
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,248
and that it was for a project
that he was working on.

391
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:16,164
I-I-I knew
it didn't sound right,

392
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,339
but I was desperate
for money.

393
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,472
And about the time I got
to the exchange,

394
00:20:19,515 --> 00:20:21,300
I realized I made a mistake,
but it was too late.

395
00:20:21,343 --> 00:20:23,737
He grabbed the detonators
and tried to shoot me.

396
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,347
I ran away and hid.

397
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,133
Zeke, is there anything else you
can tell us about this man?

398
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:30,047
His name,
the kind of car he drives?

399
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:31,875
I told you everything I know,
man.

400
00:20:35,357 --> 00:20:37,707
I'm sorry I let you down,
Miss Clark.

401
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:47,717
That is a very troubled
young man.

402
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:49,328
You really believe he didn't
know he was making detonators

403
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:52,026
for bombs?
I don't know.

404
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:55,203
For such a smart kid,
he could sometimes act a fool.

405
00:20:55,247 --> 00:20:57,727
Now he's looking
at a lifetime of incarceration

406
00:20:57,771 --> 00:20:59,555
due to federal
mandatory minimums.

407
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:01,427
I gotta get
this kid a lawyer.

408
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,081
Uh, do you really think
that's a good idea?

409
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,605
That's not gonna make you
any friends at the Bureau.

410
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:08,216
I know, but Zeke's
one of my kids.

411
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,653
I told my students
on day one,

412
00:21:10,697 --> 00:21:14,657
"Miss Clark will always have
your back, no matter what."

413
00:21:14,701 --> 00:21:17,660
That's not gonna stop
just 'cause he graduated.

414
00:21:17,704 --> 00:21:19,184
Is there anything
I can do to help?

415
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,229
I appreciate that,
but I know somebody

416
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:23,884
I can go to
about this.

417
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:26,060
It was a pleasure
working with you, John.

418
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:28,584
Wish I could stick around
to help you catch the guy.

419
00:21:28,628 --> 00:21:30,151
Me too.

420
00:21:30,195 --> 00:21:32,719
And, Simone,
don't let them get you down.

421
00:21:32,762 --> 00:21:33,937
You're the real thing.

422
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:39,116
Professor "Alien"
called again.

423
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,207
He wants an update on
the Heptapod who stole his book.

424
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,730
Well, according
to his colleagues,

425
00:21:43,773 --> 00:21:45,427
he was actually telling
the truth about one thing.

426
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,474
He is the foremost expert
on urban planning.

427
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:52,739
Unfortunately, he also pioneered
LSD micro-dosing.

428
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:54,523
And accidentally fried
his brain?

429
00:21:54,567 --> 00:21:57,613
Yeah. He has been having
hallucinations ever since.

430
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:03,271
Hello?

431
00:22:03,315 --> 00:22:06,274
Professor Meadows, we were just
discussing your case.

432
00:22:06,318 --> 00:22:09,277
Hold on.
Let me put you on speaker.

433
00:22:09,321 --> 00:22:11,323
And I just remembered something
about the break-in.

434
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:13,629
When the alien fled,
I looked out the window

435
00:22:13,673 --> 00:22:16,893
and saw him jump
into a red flying saucer.

436
00:22:16,937 --> 00:22:19,940
Oh, it was more of an oval
now that I think about it.

437
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:22,812
Okay, got it. If you remember
anything else, let us know.

438
00:22:22,856 --> 00:22:26,468
So, should I put out a BOLO
for a red spaceship?

439
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,341
No, but if we assume
that the attack is real,

440
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:31,430
then it's possible
what he saw was a red car.

441
00:22:31,473 --> 00:22:33,606
So we should start pulling
traffic-cam footage.

442
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:36,870
No problem. There's only about a
million red cars in Los Angeles.

443
00:22:36,913 --> 00:22:38,263
Hey, Grey wants
all hands on deck.

444
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:40,308
Oh, thank God.

445
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:43,920
Come on, people, can't rely on
the feds to solve this for us.

446
00:22:43,964 --> 00:22:47,184
Well, Zeke said he made
six detonators for our bomber.

447
00:22:47,228 --> 00:22:48,838
The first one,
a countdown timer that was used

448
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:51,667
at the relay station,
and the other five GPS-enabled.

449
00:22:51,711 --> 00:22:53,365
If only we had an idea
what the targets are.

450
00:22:53,408 --> 00:22:54,975
Hey, maybe we could
extrapolate them

451
00:22:55,018 --> 00:22:56,716
from the first target,
the power station.

452
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,544
There's got to be a reason
he hit that thing first.

453
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:00,981
Not because he wanted
to hurt people.

454
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:03,026
He only knocked out the power
to a big chunk of the Valley.

455
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:07,596
What if
that was the point?

456
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,338
What if he wanted to, uh,
get something or do something

457
00:23:10,382 --> 00:23:14,168
that he didn't have access to
unless the power was off?

458
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:15,387
There's at least
a dozen banks.

459
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,258
Jewelry stores,
a check-cashing place.

460
00:23:17,302 --> 00:23:18,564
I mean, there's no
high-value targets here.

461
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,696
Nothing that is
a terrorist's wet dream.

462
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,133
National Guard Armory.

463
00:23:23,177 --> 00:23:25,614
That...
That's gotta be it.

464
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:27,834
And there are enough weapons
there for an entire platoon.

465
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:31,228
And enough explosive munitions
to take out a hundred targets.

466
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,459
I'm sorry, but the
armory's in lockdown right now.

467
00:23:46,243 --> 00:23:48,898
I'm the one who called you
earlier...

468
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:50,335
about your husband.

469
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,642
Is Brady okay?

470
00:23:53,686 --> 00:23:56,123
For now.

471
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,907
And so long as you do
as you promised,

472
00:23:57,951 --> 00:23:59,605
you'll see him tonight.

473
00:23:59,648 --> 00:24:01,084
Now, let's get to work.

474
00:24:03,597 --> 00:24:06,164
Control, 7-Adam-100,
be advised Adam-15,

475
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,644
Adam-4, Adam-22, and us
are Code 3

476
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:09,080
to the National Guard
Armory

477
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:10,560
for a possible 459
in progress.

478
00:24:10,604 --> 00:24:11,909
Will advise.

479
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:12,954
Bailey,
we're three minutes out.

480
00:24:12,997 --> 00:24:14,695
Any sign
of our terror suspect?

481
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:17,611
Not yet, but the armorer chief
isn't answering his radio.

482
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,358
We're entering the cage.

483
00:24:30,493 --> 00:24:32,365
Got a man down!

484
00:24:34,236 --> 00:24:36,194
John, he's here.
Or he was.

485
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,241
Stay with him.

486
00:24:39,285 --> 00:24:40,721
Everyone, on me.

487
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,117
He's fleeing in one
of our Humvees.

488
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:48,250
South gate.

489
00:24:53,081 --> 00:24:55,301
There he is.

490
00:24:55,344 --> 00:24:58,086
7-Adam-100, suspect vehicle
heading west on Vernon.

491
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,479
Show us in pursuit.

492
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,570
Whoa, whoa.

493
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:07,225
Geez.

494
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:11,926
We need to stop
this guy.

495
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,493
That's not a minivan,
it's a mini-tank.

496
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:14,842
Bulletproof, bombproof.

497
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:16,017
Our shops
can't pit-maneuver it.

498
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,584
We have to wait
for the BearCat.

499
00:25:17,627 --> 00:25:19,368
Maybe we can box the Humvee in,
force him off the road.

500
00:25:19,412 --> 00:25:20,717
There's one way
we can find out.

501
00:25:23,285 --> 00:25:25,287
Okay, Nolan, get on his left.
We'll take the right.

502
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:28,986
You have to ram him in unison,
alright?

503
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,336
Aim for the doors.

504
00:25:30,379 --> 00:25:31,859
Whatever you do,
don't hit the wheels.

505
00:25:31,902 --> 00:25:33,251
What? Why? What happens
if I hit his wheels?

506
00:25:33,295 --> 00:25:34,775
We'll die,
and you'll forever be known

507
00:25:34,818 --> 00:25:36,472
as an LAPD cautionary tale.

508
00:25:36,516 --> 00:25:38,082
Oh, great, proving my mother
right once and for all.

509
00:25:38,126 --> 00:25:39,910
Wait. I'll be
the cautionary tale?

510
00:25:39,954 --> 00:25:41,390
No way.
If this goes bad,

511
00:25:41,434 --> 00:25:43,131
we will both be disgraced
together.

512
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,481
In position.
Alright, on three.

513
00:25:45,525 --> 00:25:47,309
One, two, three!

514
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:01,541
Show me your hands!
Now!

515
00:26:25,652 --> 00:26:27,393
Hey, Daddy.

516
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:29,438
What are you doing
in L.A.?

517
00:26:29,482 --> 00:26:33,137
Uh, you'd know if you answered
my calls or my texts or my...

518
00:26:33,181 --> 00:26:36,227
Are you still
in the FBI?

519
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:39,535
Technically, I'm just a trainee,
but...

520
00:26:40,493 --> 00:26:42,320
He did not just close this door
in my face.

521
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:44,714
Daddy!

522
00:26:44,758 --> 00:26:46,716
Open the door.
We need to talk.

523
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:49,632
Are my grandkids okay?

524
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:51,242
The twins are fine.

525
00:26:51,286 --> 00:26:53,027
Then there's nothing for us
to talk about.

526
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,724
Uh...

527
00:26:54,768 --> 00:26:55,899
Open this damn door!

528
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:58,728
Da...

529
00:26:58,772 --> 00:27:01,731
Your neighbors are out here
looking at me like I'm crazy.

530
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:03,994
Hey, Mr. Jenkins.

531
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:06,997
Your dog is so cute.

532
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,999
This is embarrassing!

533
00:27:09,043 --> 00:27:11,045
Not as embarrassing
as being a leader

534
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:13,482
in the "Defund The Police"
movement

535
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:16,920
with a daughter
in the FBI.

536
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:20,402
Do not close this door,
you stubborn old man.

537
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:23,057
If you don't want to talk to
your only daughter, fine.

538
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,667
But I'm not here
as your daughter.

539
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:26,626
I'm here as an advocate.

540
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:30,412
For who?
Zeke Freemont.

541
00:27:30,456 --> 00:27:32,196
He's one
of my former students.

542
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,677
Now he's being charged
as an accessory

543
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:36,462
in a domestic terror
plot.

544
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:39,203
And you're the only person
I trust to get him a lawyer

545
00:27:39,247 --> 00:27:41,249
that'll actually
give a damn.

546
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,642
So, see?

547
00:27:42,685 --> 00:27:44,513
This is not about
you and me.

548
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:47,777
This is about a kid
who deserves a second chance.

549
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,129
So, will you help me?

550
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:05,534
My husband was abducted
by this man.

551
00:28:05,578 --> 00:28:07,928
He threatened to kill Brady if I
didn't do exactly what he said.

552
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:09,364
Okay.
Can you describe him?

553
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:12,149
Russian... at least, his accent.
Scar on his face.

554
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:13,977
What did he steal
from my armory?

555
00:28:14,021 --> 00:28:16,893
200 kilos
of C-4 explosives.

556
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:24,159
Now, nobody asked you
to cook.

557
00:28:24,898 --> 00:28:26,856
Okay, you want me
to throw it out?

558
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:31,513
Mmm
!Okay?

559
00:28:31,556 --> 00:28:34,516
Mm-hmm. It tastes just like
your mother's.

560
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,606
Miles Davis.
I love this song.

561
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:41,044
Yeah, me too,
but it's Dizzy Gillespie.

562
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,220
Bup-bup-bup-bup.
Back up.

563
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:45,614
Don't even come over here
reaching in these pots.

564
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,746
Mama's recipe,
Mama's rules.

565
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,748
We eat at the table.

566
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:53,448
Oh, I miss everything
about your mother...

567
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:55,885
except her damn rules.

568
00:28:57,756 --> 00:29:00,934
You would always rope me in
as your accomplice

569
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:03,762
to break every single
last one of them.

570
00:29:03,806 --> 00:29:06,330
We drove Mama crazy
with our foolishness.

571
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:08,202
Yeah.

572
00:29:11,161 --> 00:29:14,469
We used to be
so close, Daddy.

573
00:29:14,512 --> 00:29:16,993
Well, that's on you.

574
00:29:17,037 --> 00:29:19,909
Joining the feds,
after everything I went through

575
00:29:19,953 --> 00:29:21,519
at the hands
of law enforcement...

576
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:24,000
Everything
wewent through.

577
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:27,786
Really? Because I was
the one incarcerated

578
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,180
for a crime
I didn't commit,

579
00:29:30,224 --> 00:29:32,791
away from you,
your mother.

580
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:35,490
Which is why I'll find
a lawyer

581
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:37,231
for your student
who is in trouble.

582
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:41,496
But, Simone, you are on
the wrong side of this trouble.

583
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:44,891
It was an FBI investigation
that got you exonerated.

584
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:49,591
And it was FBI investigations
that tried to compromise Martin,

585
00:29:49,634 --> 00:29:52,855
Malcolm, Angela,
Black Lives Matter.

586
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:56,598
Daddy, a good agent can make
more positive change

587
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:59,383
with one case than most people
do in a lifetime.

588
00:29:59,427 --> 00:30:02,821
Oh, what's that?
Quote for the yearbook?

589
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:06,173
Come on, give me a real reason
why you are doing this.

590
00:30:06,216 --> 00:30:09,393
Because we make up
less than 1%.

591
00:30:09,437 --> 00:30:13,223
Black women make up
less than 1% of the FBI.

592
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:16,139
Speeches at rallies
only do so much.

593
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:20,883
If we want real justice,
we need a voice on the inside.

594
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:22,624
You just don't get it.

595
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:26,280
Once you're in the FBI,
they'll change you.

596
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:31,589
Well,
we will never know.

597
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:35,463
'Cause I am about that close
to being kicked out.

598
00:30:38,248 --> 00:30:39,946
For what?

599
00:30:39,989 --> 00:30:42,992
Well, apparently, there two ways
of doing things...

600
00:30:43,036 --> 00:30:45,603
The FBI way
and the wrong way.

601
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:48,302
And guess which one
I'm excelling in.

602
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:49,738
So I'm screwed.

603
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,132
Not according to
Miles Davis.

604
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:55,483
He said, "When you hit
a wrong note,

605
00:30:55,526 --> 00:30:59,008
it's the next note
that makes it good or bad."

606
00:30:59,052 --> 00:31:00,967
They haven't
kicked you out yet.

607
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,186
So what happens next
is on you.

608
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,232
It's great advice,
Daddy,

609
00:31:05,275 --> 00:31:08,017
but I thought you said you
didn't want me to be in the FBI.

610
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:10,280
No, I don't.

611
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:15,503
But nobody tells my baby girl
that she doesn't belong.

612
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:22,867
Wow. The FBI doesn't really do
moderation, do they?

613
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:25,174
Seriously, it's like
a spaceship.

614
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,220
Get any sleep? No, but,
uh, Sleeping Beauty here

615
00:31:28,264 --> 00:31:29,657
got an hour
in the back of the shop.

616
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,136
Sergeant's stripes
come with privileges.

617
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,442
Don't be jealous.

618
00:31:32,386 --> 00:31:35,214
Okay, people, listen up.
Garza has an update.

619
00:31:35,258 --> 00:31:36,825
It's a whole new ballgame.

620
00:31:36,868 --> 00:31:38,522
The amount of explosives stolen
sent shock waves

621
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:40,263
through D.C. overnight.

622
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:42,831
Homeland Security is now getting
involved, as is ATF,

623
00:31:42,874 --> 00:31:45,355
which means this is no longer
a joint task force.

624
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:47,052
It's wholly federal now.

625
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:49,490
All due respect, LAPD has busted
their ass in this case.

626
00:31:49,633 --> 00:31:51,156
Hey, I get it.

627
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,245
I do,
but my hands are tied.

628
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:55,900
A terrorist got away with
over 200 kilos of C-4,

629
00:31:55,944 --> 00:31:57,902
so that kind of changes
the complexion of things.

630
00:31:57,946 --> 00:32:00,470
Are you blaming my guys for that?
Did I say that, Wade?

631
00:32:00,514 --> 00:32:02,777
Oh, no, uh,
we're all a little tired,

632
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,606
but I think we can remember
we're all on the same team here.

633
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:07,956
You're not talking
to security guards, Matt.

634
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:10,480
We've investigators, and we're
not gonna stop hunting this guy

635
00:32:10,524 --> 00:32:12,090
because you tell us to.

636
00:32:12,134 --> 00:32:14,353
Can we talk about this
in private, please?

637
00:32:14,397 --> 00:32:16,791
You're damn straight.

638
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,141
My office.

639
00:32:22,492 --> 00:32:24,146
I got a problem.
Me too.

640
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:25,756
I've been scrubbing traffic-cam
footage for hours,

641
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,584
hunting for
an extraterrestrial.

642
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:29,891
No, no, I'm serious.

643
00:32:29,934 --> 00:32:31,588
What is it?
The baby?

644
00:32:31,632 --> 00:32:33,547
No.

645
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:36,463
TID pulled partial prints
from the professor's rear door.

646
00:32:36,506 --> 00:32:38,769
You know, the one that
the aliens jimmied open?

647
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:40,205
That's not a problem.
That's great.

648
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,598
It has to belong
to the attacker.

649
00:32:41,642 --> 00:32:43,731
Exactly.
So I ran the prints,

650
00:32:43,774 --> 00:32:45,689
and they came back
as classified.

651
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:48,170
What?
Yeah, so, I called my friend

652
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:50,955
over at the DEA
who has top-secret clearance,

653
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,740
and I asked her to run
the prints,

654
00:32:52,783 --> 00:32:55,133
and she was denied
access, too.

655
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:57,005
Who the hell
is our suspect?

656
00:32:57,048 --> 00:32:59,703
I don't know,
but the classified designation

657
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:03,272
for our suspect
originated from...

658
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:07,842
the Air Force base
at Groom Lake.

659
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:09,583
Okay,
your vocal inflection

660
00:33:09,626 --> 00:33:10,845
leads me to believe
that's a big deal,

661
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:12,629
but for the life of me,
I don't know why.

662
00:33:12,673 --> 00:33:14,544
How do you not know
about Groom Lake?

663
00:33:14,588 --> 00:33:17,112
Paradise Ranch?
Dreamland?

664
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:19,897
Also known as Area 51.

665
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:22,247
Isn't that where the government
supposedly keeps the...

666
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:25,250
Aliens? Yeah.

667
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:33,708
You think I'm pissed off because
you hurt our feelings?

668
00:33:33,751 --> 00:33:35,884
We don't care... What the hell
are you still doing here?

669
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:38,234
Oh, I just need five minutes
with Agent Garza.

670
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:40,192
You're supposed to be back
at Quantico.

671
00:33:40,236 --> 00:33:42,542
You and I both know that as soon
as I get back to the Academy,

672
00:33:42,586 --> 00:33:44,327
they gonna find
a reason to fire me.

673
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,721
Here is the only place
I can prove I belong.

674
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:49,549
You're still a trainee.
It's not gonna happen.

675
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:52,291
Can you honestly say that
all my contributions

676
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:53,815
haven't earned me a place
on this task force?

677
00:33:53,858 --> 00:33:55,512
Absolutely.

678
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:58,428
A NAT who can't follow orders
has no place in the FBI.

679
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:01,866
Okay. Look... my father
was incarcerated

680
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,563
for a crime
he didn't commit.

681
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:05,783
I know.
I read your file.

682
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:08,133
Okay, w-well,
here's what's not in it.

683
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:11,006
My father was
an amazing trumpet player.

684
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,747
He was a jazz prodigy.

685
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,923
After eight years
in prison,

686
00:34:14,966 --> 00:34:17,012
never picked up
his horn again.

687
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,709
He let the system steal
that from him.

688
00:34:18,753 --> 00:34:20,145
He didn't even put up
a fight.

689
00:34:20,189 --> 00:34:22,887
He gave up on his music,
his dreams, all of it.

690
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:25,629
But let me guess.
It's not gonna be you.

691
00:34:25,673 --> 00:34:29,981
Look at you,
finally starting to get me.

692
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:31,591
Let me tell you
what I wish someone told me

693
00:34:31,635 --> 00:34:34,986
when I was a blue flamer,
trying to prove myself.

694
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,946
The FBI isn't a safe space
for women's empowerment.

695
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,817
It's a boys' club.

696
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:42,211
Now, you still have
a chance to make it.

697
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:44,779
All you have to do is fit in
by hiding who you really are.

698
00:34:44,822 --> 00:34:46,955
Honey, there's
no hiding this.

699
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:49,784
Simone, I'm trying
to help you.

700
00:34:49,827 --> 00:34:53,352
I know, Casey...
Agent Fox.

701
00:34:53,396 --> 00:34:55,790
A-And I'm sorry for whatever
you had to put up with

702
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:57,530
to do this job.

703
00:34:57,574 --> 00:34:59,489
But the one thing I learned
in this life

704
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:01,491
is to be true
to who I am.

705
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:04,973
So I'm waiting right here
for Agent Garza.

706
00:35:05,016 --> 00:35:07,018
Okay.

707
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:08,498
Here's what we're gonna do.

708
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,152
I'm gonna call a professional...

709
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:11,240
someone you could talk to
about all of this.

710
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:13,242
But you're working
with the aliens.

711
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:16,462
No, Professor, we are the ones
who are trying to help you.

712
00:35:16,506 --> 00:35:19,422
We believe that your attacker
is or was in the military.

713
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:22,033
Yes,
the galactic alien army.

714
00:35:22,077 --> 00:35:25,210
Okay, okay, maybe your attacker
was an alien.

715
00:35:25,254 --> 00:35:29,040
The truth finally prevails
with you conniving WIBs.

716
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:30,694
WIBs?

717
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:32,174
Women in Black.

718
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,788
Hi, y'all.
I'm Simone with the FBI.

719
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:39,877
Can I speak to you two
for a hot sec?

720
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:47,885
Hey, I'm not trying to tell you
how to do your job,

721
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:50,496
but that man is having
a clinical delusion.

722
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,283
He's unable to process logic,
so you challenging him

723
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:57,155
is only pushing him further
towards his beliefs.

724
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,984
And you playing along
is just making him think

725
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:01,986
his delusions are real.

726
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,772
Are you a psychiatrist
or...

727
00:36:04,815 --> 00:36:06,338
I was
a guidance counselor.

728
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:09,211
I worked with kids
experiencing everything

729
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:12,388
from schizoaffective disorder
to severe horniness.

730
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:14,259
So, you think you can
get through to him

731
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:15,695
in a way that we can't?

732
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:18,046
I think I can charm
and disarm him,

733
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:20,091
and it might bring him back
to reality.

734
00:36:20,135 --> 00:36:22,398
We could definitely use
some more reality.

735
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:23,965
Give it a try.

736
00:36:24,008 --> 00:36:28,534
Hello, sir.
I am not a Woman in Black.

737
00:36:28,578 --> 00:36:30,667
See?
I'm wearing brown and tan.

738
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,104
It's cute, right?

739
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:36,499
Mind if we go somewhere
where we could talk?

740
00:36:36,542 --> 00:36:39,545
When I was a little girl,
I used to go out in the yard

741
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:41,504
and look for UFOs.

742
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:44,202
And then, one night,
they found me.

743
00:36:44,246 --> 00:36:45,551
Extraterrestrials?

744
00:36:45,595 --> 00:36:48,076
Well, no,
a family of possums

745
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,818
rooting around
in our trash cans.

746
00:36:50,861 --> 00:36:52,341
I thought
they were ETs.

747
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:54,865
Have you ever seen
one of those things up close?

748
00:36:54,909 --> 00:36:57,128
It's otherworldly.

749
00:36:57,172 --> 00:37:00,828
But I never stopped believing
that it was possible

750
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:02,438
we're not alone
in the universe.

751
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:04,396
We're not.

752
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,836
I was attacked by a Heptapod who
smelled of chocolate and blood.

753
00:37:08,879 --> 00:37:13,492
Okay, see, now, Professor,
that makes me wonder

754
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:19,281
why you're the only person
who saw this bizarre creature.

755
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:22,197
Because he's a shape-shifter
who can take on many forms.

756
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,590
Okay. Like what?

757
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:27,855
A white man in his 30s.

758
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:30,161
Okay, what else can you tell me
about him,

759
00:37:30,205 --> 00:37:32,511
when he was a white man
in his 30s?

760
00:37:32,555 --> 00:37:34,818
He spoke Russian.

761
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:36,167
Well, at least,
he had an accent.

762
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:37,473
It's hard to remember.

763
00:37:37,516 --> 00:37:39,388
W-Well, Professor,

764
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:43,479
did the man have a scar
on the left side of his face?

765
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:44,784
You've seen him, too.

766
00:37:44,828 --> 00:37:46,134
I'll be right back.

767
00:37:47,962 --> 00:37:49,615
Do you have
a task force BOLO?

768
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:50,878
I can pull it up
on my phone.

769
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,578
Professor...
is this the man

770
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:58,407
that attacked you
inside your home?

771
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,278
Yes! That's him.

772
00:38:02,896 --> 00:38:05,377
Okay, everybody, our suspect
is renting a house

773
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,226
in Lincoln Heights under
the name Trevor Gurin.

774
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,862
We tracked him there through
traffic-cam footage

775
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:10,768
from his origin point
at the professor's house.

776
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,040
That's great work,
detectives.

777
00:38:12,035 --> 00:38:13,384
Actually, Simone deserves
the credit.

778
00:38:13,427 --> 00:38:14,864
She's the one who put it
all together.

779
00:38:18,302 --> 00:38:19,651
Good work.

780
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:20,913
Thank you, sir.
I just...

781
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:22,828
Mobilize additional agents
and HRT.

782
00:38:22,872 --> 00:38:24,308
And notify Homeland
and ATF.

783
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:25,918
So, you two on me.

784
00:38:25,962 --> 00:38:27,659
Get schematics for the house,
send them to my box.

785
00:38:27,703 --> 00:38:29,443
I'll put in for a telephonic
warrant. Alright.

786
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:42,843
So, you think I should
put you on the task force?

787
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,980
Honestly, only a fool
would keep me off it.

788
00:38:49,024 --> 00:38:50,982
Are you calling me
a fool?

789
00:38:51,026 --> 00:38:53,506
Are you putting me
on the task force?

790
00:38:56,031 --> 00:38:58,859
Yeah.

791
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,383
You're riding with me.
Let's go.

792
00:39:02,037 --> 00:39:03,473
Yes!

793
00:39:05,866 --> 00:39:07,607
Go, go, go!

794
00:39:07,651 --> 00:39:09,870
Secure the perimeter.

795
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:11,176
We got a body!

796
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,395
Is it our suspect?

797
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:15,354
No, the abducted husband.

798
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:17,443
Given how cold he is, I'd say
Gurin killed him last night

799
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:19,706
when he got back
from stealing the explosives.

800
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,273
House is clear.
For all we know,

801
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,275
this guy's pulling off
his next attacks as we speak.

802
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,060
So let's tear this place apart.
We're looking for anything

803
00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:27,105
that might indicate
our unsub's targets.

804
00:39:27,149 --> 00:39:30,108
All units, be advised
suspect still at large.

805
00:39:30,152 --> 00:39:32,937
Male Caucasian,
armed and dangerous.

806
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:34,895
Hey,
I-I think this is a map.

807
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,636
It has to have been
of L.A.,

808
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,247
and there were
other pins in it.

809
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,900
If we could
find the publisher,

810
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,425
maybe we could match
the pinholes with locations?

811
00:39:42,468 --> 00:39:44,209
Yeah. On it.
We got a whole department

812
00:39:44,253 --> 00:39:46,429
of eggheads who love solving
these kinds of puzzles.

813
00:39:46,472 --> 00:39:47,734
You got something?

814
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:49,171
There's no mattress
in there.

815
00:39:49,214 --> 00:39:51,260
This guy was just sleeping
on a hard-ass floor.

816
00:39:51,303 --> 00:39:52,565
Alright, so, what do you think
it means?

817
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:54,350
He's punishing himself.

818
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:56,613
Nothing soft, nothing warm,
no creature comforts.

819
00:39:56,656 --> 00:39:58,484
Military man, maybe?

820
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:00,095
Used to sleeping on the ground?
Finds a bed too soft?

821
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:02,053
Or maybe too indulgent.

822
00:40:02,097 --> 00:40:04,055
So, what's a better way
to stay focused on the mission

823
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:05,491
than to take away
every small pleasure?

824
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:06,753
Sure, that tracks.

825
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:07,885
What I can't
wrap my mind around

826
00:40:07,928 --> 00:40:09,974
is the connection
to Area 51.

827
00:40:10,018 --> 00:40:11,454
Why would they classify
his fingerprints?

828
00:40:11,497 --> 00:40:15,327
You know, stories about aliens
at Area 51 were only a cover

829
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,199
that they were doing
covert operations there.

830
00:40:17,242 --> 00:40:18,635
So, what are we saying?

831
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:21,899
Our suspect had ties
to classified U.S. operations?

832
00:40:21,942 --> 00:40:23,118
Geez, what a nightmare
that would be.

833
00:40:23,161 --> 00:40:24,902
Chen found something.

834
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:27,122
Uh, I figured he would write
on the map,

835
00:40:27,165 --> 00:40:28,340
so I did a wall rubbing.

836
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,559
Uh, I found a word.

837
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:32,605
It's faint,
but I think it says "Enervo."

838
00:40:32,649 --> 00:40:35,565
What does that mean? It's Latin.
It means "to deprive of power."

839
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:37,610
Yeah, I worked with a lot of CIA
guys in Afghanistan,

840
00:40:37,654 --> 00:40:39,047
and Enervo is just the type

841
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,787
of pretentious code name
they'd give an op.

842
00:40:40,831 --> 00:40:42,485
"Deprive of power"
is exactly

843
00:40:42,528 --> 00:40:43,921
what he was doing
with the first bombing.

844
00:40:43,964 --> 00:40:45,836
You think he'd go after
more relay stations?

845
00:40:45,879 --> 00:40:49,100
No. In a ground war, what's
the military's first target?

846
00:40:49,144 --> 00:40:50,536
Take out the enemy's
infrastructure.

847
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,060
Power, water...
Roads.

848
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:55,976
That's why he stole the
professor's book on traffic.

849
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,414
Quickest way to cripple this
city... take out the freeways.

850
00:41:13,907 --> 00:41:17,085
Hello.
I'm Professor Meadows.

851
00:41:17,128 --> 00:41:19,130
I'm so pleased you all agreed
to help me

852
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:20,697
with my little
research project

853
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:23,265
on traffic patterns
in Los Angeles.

854
00:41:23,308 --> 00:41:25,223
Inside the envelope,
you'll find your first payment

855
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:28,357
and your precise driving route
for the day.

856
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,185
It's vital

857
00:41:30,228 --> 00:41:32,665
that you follow the exact
directions in your envelope.

858
00:41:32,709 --> 00:41:35,712
Otherwise, you won't get
your delivery payment.

859
00:41:37,366 --> 00:41:40,108
Excellent.
Then get going.

860
00:41:40,151 --> 00:41:42,110
And remember... drive safe.

861
