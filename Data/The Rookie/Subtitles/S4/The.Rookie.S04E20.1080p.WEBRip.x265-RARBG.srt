1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,100
Previously on "The Rookie"...

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,500
- And he had an accent.
- He was Russian.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,600
We've been hearing rumors about

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,000
a potential terror attack
for weeks.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,400
- Who are you?
- Simone Clark.

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,500
You're the only one in that room

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,600
who actually knows
our Mr. Freemont.

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,400
Miss Clark, is that you?
Yes, honey.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,000
Give me a real reason
why you're doing this.

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:23,000
Daddy, Black women make up
less than 1% of the FBI.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,200
We need a voice on the inside.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,800
Suspect says
he'll only talk to you.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm in real trouble?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,500
I'm afraid you are.

15
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,500
He paid you to build a bomb
for him?

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,100
Just the detonators.

17
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
What did he steal
from my armory?

18
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,400
200 kilos of C-4 explosives.

19
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,400
Quickest way to cripple this
city... take out the freeways.

20
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,800
It's vital that you follow
your driving route exactly.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I need a chopper at my location
in two minutes.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,500
Harper and Lopez have something.

23
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
So, we did a deep dive
on the Trevor Gurin alias.

24
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,000
He rented five box trucks
yesterday.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,100
So he made five truck bombs with
GPS triggers and stolen C-4?

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,600
Yeah, according to
the rental place,

27
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,600
the trucks are each decorated
with a different state...

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,600
Alaska, Florida,
Kentucky, Idaho, and Utah.

29
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,100
We gotta shut the city down.

30
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,000
Shut down all the traffic
in Los Angeles?

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,900
She's right. Better to overreact
than under.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,800
You know, car rental places
put GPS trackers

33
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,400
in a lot of
their rental vehicles.

34
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,900
Yeah, we asked about that.

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,600
The manager said that
all the trucks are wired

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,300
but the data is collected
in a central hub out of state,

37
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,600
so we're gonna need
a federal warrant to access it.

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm on it.
In the meantime,

39
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,800
get out county-wide BOLOs
on the trucks

40
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,200
and mobilize the bomb squad.

41
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,000
Alright, everybody with a pulse,

42
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,200
get in your car
and hit the streets.

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Find those trucks.

44
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,400
Tell units to proceed
with extreme caution, okay?

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,000
We don't know who's driving
these things or whether

46
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,500
they're part of a terror cell.

47
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,700
There's my ride. I'm going up
to provide overwatch.

48
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,100
I'll come with you.

49
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,700
Wanna ride with me?
I thought you'd never ask.

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,300
How the hell
are we gonna find them?

51
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,200
Manpower.
And prayer.

52
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,600
No!

53
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,400
Control, we got an explosion
downtown

54
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,200
south of the Staples Center.

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,600
Mobilize fire and rescue.

56
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,500
Sirs, do you want us
to divert to the scene?

57
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,400
That's a negative. We need to
find the other trucks now!

58
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,900
Roger that.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,700
7-Adam-13 arriving on scene.

60
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,000
Freeway has partially collapsed
at West 12.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,100
There are multiple vehicles
crushed in the wreckage.

62
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,800
I need help here.
What happened?

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He just blew up a section
of the 110.

64
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,100
Okay, we need to focus.

65
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,700
If we are assuming
that he is targeting

66
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,200
all the major freeways,

67
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,300
we need units on the 10,
the 405, and the 101.

68
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,900
But at which spots?
L.A. has 500 miles of freeway.

69
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,700
How is this real?

70
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,900
Two days ago,
I was being lectured

71
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
on the proper way
to do paperwork in the FBI.

72
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,000
That's the way this job works.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,500
The daily swing
between tedium and tragedy

74
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,000
will give you whiplash.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Well, don't get me wrong.

76
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,800
Being a guidance counselor
was the same way.

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,800
One minute, you're helping a kid
do a college essay.

78
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
And the next, you're talking
someone off a ledge...

79
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,400
Literally.

80
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,900
It's like I said.

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,700
That's the experience
that'll give you a leg up

82
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,300
over your fellow trainees.

83
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,200
We may not have the speed
or endurance those kids have,

84
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
but we have a hell of a lot more
life experience.

85
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,900
I wish we could use
that experience to stop a bomb.

86
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,000
We can try.

87
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,000
You want me to think
like a terrorist?

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,900
No. Like a commuter.

89
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,900
Right.

90
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,300
Where in the city is traffic
the biggest pain in the ass?

91
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,800
The bottlenecks,
the choke points. The...

92
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,300
You got something?

93
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,200
Yep. Head north.

94
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,200
There's Florida.

95
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,200
7-Adam-100 in pursuit
of Truck Florida.

96
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,400
Heading south on Crenshaw.

97
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,500
Get your hands outside the vehicle!
Whoa, whoa!

98
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,900
I want you to open the door
from the outside

99
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,900
and get out of the truck!
Okay!

100
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,500
Let's go!
Whoa!

101
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,300
Put your hands on the hood!
What the hell's happening?!

102
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,100
- Where are the trucks headed?
- What? I don't know.

103
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
Is there a manual trigger for your bomb?
What bomb?

104
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,900
What the hell's going on here?

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,400
We don't have time for this.
Where are the three other trucks heading?

106
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,600
I don't know.

107
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,500
The guy said it was
a traffic study, okay?

108
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,900
He paid us each 100 bucks
to drive a precise route!

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,300
Control, 7-Adam-100.

110
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,600
We stopped the Florida truck,
one in custody.

111
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,400
He seems to have no clue
there's a bomb on his truck.

112
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,600
Does he know anything
about the other targets?

113
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,100
Negative.
It seems the other trucks

114
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,800
are being driven by innocents,
so even if we stop them,

115
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,200
we won't be able to
stop the bomber.

116
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,200
There!

117
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,000
All units,
I have eyes on Truck Idaho

118
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,400
heading west on Olympic,
two blocks east of the 405.

119
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,800
That's west on Olympic,
two blocks east of the 405.

120
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,400
They got him. Thank God.

121
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,800
Hey, Sarge, it's Smitty.
We just stopped a truck, too.

122
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,400
Truck Utah, driver in custody.

123
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,000
Smitty!

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,800
I take back every negative
thing I've ever said about you.

125
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,800
What? You've said negative
things about me?

126
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,700
We might just pull this off.

127
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,400
All units, the fourth truck
has safely been stopped.

128
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,000
That leaves Truck Kentucky
in play.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,900
Given the previous targets,
our best guess is

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,800
that he's headed for the 101.

131
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
Sir, I got the GPS feed.

132
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
The final truck is heading north
on Tujunga.

133
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,500
They're only a block away
from the freeway.

134
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,600
7-Adam-15.

135
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,800
We're on intercept course,
approaching the freeway now.

136
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,500
You realize
if this guy doesn't stop,

137
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,800
we're gonna have to ram him.

138
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,200
You want to ram a truck
full of explosives?

139
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,100
C-4 requires a detonator
to explode.

140
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,600
But fuel only needs a spark.

141
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,500
If you have a better idea,
I'm all ears.

142
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,600
Don't move.

143
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,200
You okay?

144
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,400
I think so.

145
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,800
That was so stupid.

146
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,900
She's pretty judgy
for a first responder.

147
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,300
It's because
she actually lives with me.

148
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,300
Cute. You did good.
Trust me, I know.

149
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,500
Did either of you lose
consciousness in the crash?

150
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,400
No.
Nuh.

151
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,200
What about pain?
Yeah.

152
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,200
But closer to a tequila hangover
than natural childbirth.

153
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,800
Sir, Nolan and Clark are
conscious and ambulatory.

154
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,200
Good. Get them out of there and
fall back to a safe distance.

155
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,100
That bomb could still go off.

156
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,800
We need to shut down
the 101 from the 170 to Laurel.

157
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,900
Coordinate with CHP,
Sheriff's Department.

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,100
Hell, mobilize the postal
police if you have to.

159
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,800
Just get that roadway cleared.

160
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,700
As awful as it is,
it could've been a lot worse.

161
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,300
Still could be.

162
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,500
Who knows what this guy
is planning next?

163
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,100
I think I'm gonna pay the CIA
a visit.

164
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,500
You want me to drop you off?

165
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,900
Hell no.
Let's go jack 'em up.

166
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,000
The death toll is estimated
at 17

167
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,200
with at least two dozen injured,

168
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,200
and that number is
expected to rise

169
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,400
as rescue crews dig through
the wreckage

170
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,400
of that fallen overpass.

171
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,900
Hey, Tim sent me back to help.
What can I do?

172
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,100
We just got a photo of our guy
from the rental place.

173
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,900
Harper is running it now
through VICAP,

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and we just sent it to Fox

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,700
to run through
the federal databases.

176
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,900
Are they gonna release that
to the public?

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,100
That was my recommendation,

178
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,100
but the feds want to study
the issue first.

179
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,300
In the meantime, we're sending
every available officer

180
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
to roust their C.I.s
and show them the picture.

181
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,000
I need you running
our Command Center.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,700
All intel, all leads, all data
filters through you.

183
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,900
CC the FBI on everything,
but don't give out anything

184
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,900
to patrol without my say so.

185
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,500
Cool?
Yep. You've got it.

186
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,600
Um, where's Grey?

187
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,900
Paying a visit to the CIA.

188
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,300
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Bill August.

189
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,300
Matthew Garza.
This is Wade Grey.

190
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Hey. You're
the station chief?

191
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,100
Why don't we save the specifics
until we get into the SCIF?

192
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,700
Follow me.

193
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,500
Fair enough.

194
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,600
Gentlemen.

195
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,600
We can talk freely in here.

196
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,800
How can I help?

197
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,800
We think our terror suspect
might have ties to the CIA.

198
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,300
Why?
When we ran his fingerprints,

199
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,500
they came back as classified...
Out of Groom Lake.

200
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,000
That's unsettling. I mean,
there's a million reasons

201
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,100
why something gets classified
inside the agency.

202
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,500
Honestly, it's kind of
a default action.

203
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,800
You recognize this man?

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,500
No.
Is that your suspect?

205
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,000
And according to
witnesses, very Russian.

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,400
Well, again, unsettling,

207
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
but I'm not sure
how I can help you.

208
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm sure being a station chief
seems like a big deal,

209
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,700
and it is in Moscow or Seoul,
but in L.A.,

210
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,300
it's a sign of
a senior officer on the margins,

211
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,300
so... That's very humble of you.

212
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,700
I'm anything but humble,
Sergeant.

213
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,400
Just trying to set expectations.

214
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,600
So that when you're not helpful,
we won't hold it against you?

215
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,200
Hold on, Matt.

216
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,200
Let's give the guy a chance
to be a team player.

217
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,900
What do you know about Enervo?

218
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,900
Nothing.
What is it?

219
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,200
Well, current thinking is
it's an Agency Black Op.

220
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,400
Based on what evidence?

221
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,300
Suspect had it written down
in his house.

222
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,900
Look, gentlemen, I know
you're trying to get this guy.

223
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,700
And I respect that.

224
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,900
He committed a heinous
terrorist act on your watch.

225
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,700
But I resent you
coming down here

226
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
and trying to hang it
on the Agency.

227
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,600
We're not looking
to assign blame.

228
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,600
We need to catch this guy
before he kills anyone else.

229
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,100
We're hoping you can help us.

230
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Of course.

231
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,500
I'll look into
the fingerprint classification.

232
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,100
You give me a copy
of that photo,

233
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,600
I'll kick it to D.O.,
see if it rings any bells.

234
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,000
Thank you.
You bet.

235
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Problem?

236
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,500
Maybe.

237
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,400
Get the band warmed up.

238
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,200
Why aren't you
in a hospital bed?

239
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,300
Because I'm fine, Daddy.

240
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,700
John, Bailey, this is Cutty.

241
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,900
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

242
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,300
You're palling around
with the LAPD now?

243
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,800
Forgive him.
He's mad at me, not you.

244
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,200
We're in the middle of a thing

245
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,400
because he's unhappy
with my career choice.

246
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,300
But deep down inside,

247
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,400
he's just afraid that
something is gonna happen to me.

248
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,300
But he should stop being mad
and give me a hug

249
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,400
because I was really scared
I was gonna die today

250
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,800
and leave my babies all alone
with a grumpy old grandpa

251
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,500
who doesn't know how to read
the emotional room.

252
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,800
Come here.

253
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,100
I gotta get down to the truck.

254
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,900
We're headed
to the freeway collapse.

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,900
But listen, I need you
to stop almost dying.

256
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,700
I'll stop taking risks
when you do.

257
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,600
You don't fight fair.
Later.

258
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,300
Doc released you already?

259
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,800
Yeah, ready to go back to work.

260
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Ooh, me too.

261
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,100
No, no, no.
Wait a minute.

262
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,300
You're a trainee.

263
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,400
They shouldn't be putting you
in harm's way.

264
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,600
Daddy.

265
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,400
Actually, sir,
your daughter has been vital

266
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,200
to the progress we've made
on the case so far.

267
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,400
If you're up for it,

268
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,000
I was about to head into the
office to start crunching data,

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,200
combing through
the tip-line records.

270
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,400
Sounds safe.
I-I approve.

271
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,600
Of course you do.

272
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,400
Come on.

273
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,700
Thank you for that.

274
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,700
No problem. I've been there
with my parents.

275
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I picked you up
some fresh clothes.

276
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,900
Just guessed at your sizes.

277
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,100
Looking out for me
and checking me out?

278
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,100
Okay.

279
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,700
Alright, what's the next step?

280
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,100
Grey struck out
with the station chief.

281
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,300
Asked me to make contact

282
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,900
with one of my old pals
in Operations.

283
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,500
You think he'll know
something about Enervo?

284
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,900
She. Kate Hill.

285
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,200
She ran Operations for the CIA

286
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,500
in Northern Iraq
when I was there.

287
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
Let's see what she has to say.

288
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,400
It's starting to sink in,
isn't it?

289
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,200
It's just low blood sugar.

290
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,500
Probably need to
get something to eat.

291
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Don't do that.
Trust me.

292
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,400
The harder you push it down,
the harder it comes back up.

293
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,000
You almost died.

294
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,600
No one walks away
from that unchanged.

295
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,800
I thought I was gonna be blown
into a million little pieces.

296
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,500
Nothing even left
for my twins to bury.

297
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,200
You got kids?

298
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,000
Ha! I have cats.

299
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,200
Who'd miss me for, what,
10, 20 seconds, tops?

300
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,000
You gotta have somebody
outside this job.

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I mean, other than
your judgy parents.

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,200
There was a girl I picked up
at a bar last week.

303
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,600
Okay! Now we talking.
What's her name?

304
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
I don't remember.

305
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,000
One-night stands
are kind of my specialty.

306
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,700
Keeps me focused on the job.

307
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,000
Well, was it good at least?

308
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,800
Ooh!

309
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,200
Damn, okay!

310
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,600
My last boyfriend broke up
with me when he found out

311
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,200
that I sometimes
have girlfriends.

312
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
And my last girlfriend
broke up with me

313
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,600
when I joined the FBI, so...

314
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,200
She was smart.
What?

315
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,000
This job's a straight-up
serial killer

316
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,300
when it comes to relationships.

317
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,600
Maybe for you.

318
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,500
But I know how to balance
my work and personal life.

319
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,900
Really?

320
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,500
Yeah, you were,

321
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,400
when you were a high-school
guidance counselor.

322
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,100
Hours were, what,
8:00 to 4:00?

323
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,000
And you had summers off.

324
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,400
The FBI has no set schedule,

325
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,200
no agent development days
where the criminals stay home.

326
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:21,900
Once you clock in,
you never really clock out.

327
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,600
Thank you for meeting us.

328
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,600
I almost didn't.
Can't be a coincidence

329
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,000
that the first time I hear
from you in years is today.

330
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,200
No. We think our suspect might
be connected to the Agency.

331
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,300
That's above my pay grade.
Go talk to a GS-14.

332
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,800
My boss did.
He's getting the runaround.

333
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,500
And you expect me to stick
my neck out for you

334
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,000
'cause we hooked up once
under the rockets' red glare?

335
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No. Because innocent people
are dead.

336
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,300
What do you know about Enervo?

337
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,900
Nothing.

338
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,300
Bull.
What does it mean?

339
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,100
It means you just nuked me.

340
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,400
That's a little dramatic,
don't you think?

341
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,700
No.
He called me at work.

342
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,200
And I would bet money that
somebody used the "E" name

343
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,500
on an unsecured cellphone

344
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,600
where it was captured
by an NSA keyword program

345
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,300
that triggered an immediate
tactical response.

346
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,500
Hell, there's probably
a predator drone

347
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,700
up there right now.
Kate. It...

348
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,000
Damn it!

349
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,600
Yeah, don't do that.

350
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,700
You lose a shooting war
10 times out of 10.

351
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,900
Hi, Kate.

352
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,100
Colin, I didn't say anything.

353
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,500
Yeah, I'm sure you didn't,

354
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,100
but we still need to
go talk about it.

355
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,800
Who are you?
Kate's ride to work.

356
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,200
Well, she doesn't
want to go with you.

357
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,400
Yeah, no one ever does, but this
is a national security matter,

358
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,700
so go ahead and step back

359
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,400
and allow her
to get in the vehicle.

360
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,200
I know you think
you're protecting her,

361
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,700
but you're only making it worse.

362
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,800
It's okay.
Alright?

363
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,900
Have a nice day, Officers.

364
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,200
And you're sure they were CIA?

365
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,300
Yes, sir.
There were eight of them,

366
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,600
plain clothes, no credentials.
Kate knew them.

367
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,100
Clearly, they're afraid
we'll get her to talk,

368
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,800
which means whatever she knows
is bad for the Agency.

369
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,200
We need to get her back, now.

370
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,600
Sir, I slipped my mobile
into her jacket pocket.

371
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
We can use that to track her.

372
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,000
Great work, Nolan.

373
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,700
Alright, stand by while
we get a trace going.

374
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Elena. Six things. Ready?
One, call Senator "Smith."

375
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,600
Tell him "The Postman
walked the dog."

376
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,300
Two, notify the state's
attorney's office.

377
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
I need Dr. Reaser here now.

378
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Three, track and activate a cell

379
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,700
for LAPD officer John Nolan,
badge...

380
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,600
25253.
That.

381
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,000
Four, I need an AWAX
above 20,000 feet.

382
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Tell them Senator Smith
authorized it.

383
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,400
Five, move Polaris 11 to
longitude 34.052 degrees north

384
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,600
and 118.24 degrees west.

385
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,100
Finally, mobilize HRT
for a hostage rescue.

386
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,900
Get all that? Good.
Love you.

387
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
What?

388
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,100
You say "love you" when ending
calls with your assistant?

389
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,500
All that cool stuff I just said

390
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,500
and that's what
you're interested in?

391
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,100
My assistant happens
to be my niece.

392
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,900
Come on, like there's
no nepotism in the LAPD.

393
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,100
I'm not saying anything.
I'm just driving.

394
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,600
Damn it.
Turn around.

395
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,400
Come out of the car!

396
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,800
Hands where I can see them.

397
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,500
Because you lose this
shooting war 10 times out of 10.

398
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,200
Kate, you can come out, too.

399
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,400
You're interfering with
a national security operation.

400
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,600
Is that right? Maybe you could
come down to the station,

401
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,800
tell us all about it?

402
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,300
That's what I thought.

403
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
You really screwed me.

404
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,900
That wasn't my intention.

405
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,300
But you can yell at me
all the way back to the station.

406
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,100
Have a nice day, citizens.

407
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,800
After we're gone, wait five
minutes, then let them go.

408
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,900
Hi.
I'm Simone Clark.

409
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
Friendly.
They're busy.

410
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,400
Pull up a terminal.

411
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,200
We need any tips relating to
a man with a Russian accent.

412
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,400
There's no telling how long
he's been planning this,

413
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
so go back at least a year.

414
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,500
Yes, ma'am.

415
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,300
Whoa!
That's a lot.

416
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,900
The key is to keep organized.

417
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,300
I assign a system of letters
and numbers to separate the tips

418
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,200
based on the details
of the call,

419
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,200
then I apply a color scale
rating to each tip

420
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,800
as it's corroborated
or challenged

421
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,400
by other tips
of similar reliability.

422
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,600
That's really
how your brain works?

423
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,300
You'll get it.
Just takes a minute.

424
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,800
And that's what
all these people are doing?

425
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,700
Running searches
on various databases?

426
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,400
They didn't cover this
in Quantico?

427
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,200
It's different when you actually
see it on its feet.

428
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Your system is impressive
and useful, I'm sure.

429
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Maybe not the best
for my skills.

430
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,300
I'm more of a people person.

431
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,200
You were a people person.
Now you're an FBI agent.

432
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,800
And this is how we solve cases.

433
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,200
But that doesn't make any sense.

434
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,800
Shouldn't they encourage us
to use

435
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
our innate interests
and abilities

436
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,800
instead of trying to force
everybody into the same mold?

437
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,200
The Bureau doesn't think
like that.

438
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,600
Well, they should.

439
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,200
Hell, if I could change my life
at this age,

440
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,300
the Bureau could change
some things, too.

441
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,600
You sound like Garza.

442
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,300
Really? The boss wants to
shake things up?

443
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,700
I shouldn't have said anything.
Spill it.

444
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,500
He's talking about
trying to launch a new unit,

445
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,400
one that spends more time
on the street and less in here.

446
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,500
Ding, ding.
Okay.

447
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,400
Sign me up.
Slow your roll, trainee.

448
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,300
Let's focus on the task at hand.

449
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:32,700
Right. Yes.

450
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,100
But I need to go
to the bathroom.

451
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,500
Unless I need to get approval
for that in triplicate.

452
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Only for number two.

453
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,200
Down the hall on the right.

454
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,700
Excuse me.

455
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,200
Is there a Lost and Found here?

456
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,400
Thank you.

457
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Miss Clark.

458
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,500
Hey, Zeke.
How they treating you?

459
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Better than I deserve.

460
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,600
You talk to that lawyer
my daddy got for you?

461
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,400
Yeah.
She seems nice.

462
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,100
I got you something.
Boom.

463
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,100
I know how the headphones help
with your sensory issues.

464
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,500
Now, it's not the unlimited
playlist you're used to,

465
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,900
but hopefully it'll do the trick

466
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,600
until I can get you
something better.

467
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Thank you.

468
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,400
We a long way from
Claybourne High School?

469
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,200
I heard the agents talking.

470
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,800
They said there was
an explosion.

471
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,500
With the detonators I made?

472
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,500
How many people were killed?

473
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,700
17

474
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
And twice that in the hospital.

475
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,700
God.
I just want to die.

476
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,500
But you're gonna live.
Pick your head up.

477
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,600
Even incarcerated,
you can still do some good.

478
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,400
You got a big debt on you now,

479
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,200
one you'll never be
able to pay back,

480
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,600
but you can spend the rest
of your life trying.

481
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,300
Did they catch that Russian yet?

482
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,100
No. And that's what
I need your help with.

483
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,500
I already told you all I know.

484
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,700
No, you didn't.

485
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,100
You told me what you thought
was important.

486
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,100
Let me be the judge of that.
Close your eyes.

487
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,500
Come on.
Now I need you to think.

488
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,900
Think about every moment
you spent with this man,

489
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,100
from the first time you saw him
to the last.

490
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,200
Is there anything
that stands out?

491
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,500
A-A behavior, actions?

492
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,600
No.

493
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,300
But...?

494
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,000
He reminded me a little
of Coach Taylor.

495
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,800
300 pounds with...

496
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,800
With a Boston accent so thick,
you could smell the chowder?

497
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,000
Nah. Do you remember
those energy bars

498
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,500
Coach was eating all the time?

499
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,700
Ooh, always smacking
with his mouth open

500
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,600
like he ain't had
no damn home training.

501
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Yeah, well, the Russian guy
ate the same way.

502
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,400
Same bar?
No.

503
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
The label was in Russian
and had a weird design on it.

504
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
And it smelled bad.

505
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,200
Shoot.
Fox is looking for me.

506
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,700
I gotta go, baby,
but if I can get them

507
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,300
to bring you some paper,

508
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,000
you think you could draw me
a picture of it?

509
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Find somewhere else to be.

510
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,100
What?
Things are about to get hot.

511
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,300
I just saw the bomber
from the news.

512
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,500
Parked a red car
off an alley on 7th.

513
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,400
Walked away.

514
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,700
Hurry.

515
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,300
Okay, detectives, so, Becky here

516
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,800
was able to sweep every part
of the vehicle

517
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
for explosives,
except the inside.

518
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,500
That honor is mine.

519
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,200
No trip wires visible.

520
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm lifting the driver's side
door now.

521
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,900
We're clear!

522
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,900
Hey, ladies.

523
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,100
My favorite detectives fighting
crime and looking good doing it.

524
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,100
Bomb squad just cleared the car.
No explosives. I'm jealous.

525
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,400
You guys are watching
"Hurt Locker"

526
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,500
and I'm reading
about paranoid shut-ins

527
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,400
who think Russian spies
are their neighbors.

528
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,100
What?

529
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,000
It's not up to us which aspect
of our investigation

530
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,700
we share with local law.

531
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,800
What did I share?
It's not classified intel.

532
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,600
We're working a tip line.
Why wouldn't I share that?

533
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,200
Because it's FBI policy.

534
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,800
Hey, guys,
you need to hear this.

535
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,200
The 911 call of the guy
who called in the car.

536
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,600
I just saw the bomber
from the news.

537
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,300
Parked a red car
off an alley on 7th.

538
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,100
Walked away.
Hurry.

539
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,200
That's got to be him.
He wanted us to find the car.

540
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,100
Which would make sense
if he booby-trapped the car

541
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,000
to blow us up, but w-why call
it in if he wasn't doing that?

542
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,100
Detectives.

543
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Detectives.

544
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,700
Our suspect left you
a little something

545
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,000
on the steering column.

546
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,900
That's weird.

547
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,900
That's weird, right?
Yeah, very.

548
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,500
Here, get this into the office.

549
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
I'll call the lab and get them
to put a rush on it.

550
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,800
Look, I'm sorry
how today went down.

551
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,400
Which helps me not at all.

552
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,300
And you are crazy if you think
I'm gonna reveal

553
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,100
classified intel
in a police station

554
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,700
where the whole world
is listening.

555
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,100
Okay, you are in this mess
because your Agency

556
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,100
would rather guard
their precious little secrets

557
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,200
than help us bring a terrorist
to justice.

558
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,300
So if you know something that
might help us catch this guy

559
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,300
and you refuse to share it,
I'll arrest you

560
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,100
for accessory after the fact
to terrorism.

561
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,500
Your friend sucks.

562
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,100
I'm just getting warmed up.

563
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,900
The CIA isn't taking you back.

564
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,700
Yeah.
Not what you want to hear,

565
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,500
I know, but it's the reality.

566
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,800
So you have got a choice
to make...

567
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,100
The right one...
or the wrong one.

568
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,800
Look, dozens are dead, but the
goal was hundreds, thousands.

569
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,300
Now, I know you joined the
Agency to protect this country,

570
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,100
so it's time to step up
and do it.

571
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,200
What's Enervo?

572
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,700
It's an answer.
To what question?

573
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,400
How can the CIA destabilize
a foreign city

574
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,100
without ever firing a shot?

575
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,800
Enervo was a black op

576
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,900
where foreign assets were
recruited and trained

577
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,200
to create chaos
in their home countries.

578
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,900
So the CIA could keep their
fingerprints off of it all.

579
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,600
Who authorized this operation?

580
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,900
I don't know.
You're lying!

581
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,300
Why would I at this point?

582
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,900
I have no idea
who ran the program.

583
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,200
Rumor is it was never
officially sanctioned.

584
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,000
You recognize him?

585
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,900
Yes. Ilya Sokurov.

586
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
He was a foreign asset.

587
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,500
I heard he was recruited
for Enervo.

588
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,200
But the Russians captured him
in 2018,

589
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,700
accused him of being a spy,
and sent him to a penal colony.

590
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,900
Where the CIA abandoned him.

591
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,400
It's SOP.
Sokurov knew the risks.

592
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,600
But apparently he escaped.

593
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,500
And now he's using what
we taught him against us.

594
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,900
Hey, any update?

595
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,800
Not yet.

596
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,200
Same as when you last asked...
Five minutes ago.

597
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,000
You would think that someone
would come up with

598
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,200
a faster way to get DNA results.

599
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,000
Well, maybe you can go do that.

600
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,500
There you are.
Prisoner in holding

601
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,600
wanted me to give you this.

602
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,500
Good man, Zeke.

603
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,100
Anyone in this building
a Russia expert?

604
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,600
I mean, not like Russia Russia,

605
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,400
but where somebody might go
to buy a weird energy bar?

606
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,400
I doubt it.
But you can take it to CID.

607
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,900
They can source
the manufacturer,

608
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,400
chase down
the distributor network,

609
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,800
come up with a list of stores.

610
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,500
Probably get an answer
in a couple days.

611
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,500
I don't have a couple of days.

612
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,600
I'm gonna call my father.

613
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,800
He used to play jazz
with some Russians,

614
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,600
and I bet you
he still keeps in touch.

615
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,200
This is Cutty.
Leave a message.

616
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,300
Why do I even bother?!

617
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,100
This man never
answers his phone.

618
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,300
What's the good
in having a cellphone

619
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,700
if he never answers?

620
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,300
This really sounds
like a conversation

621
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,300
you should have with him.

622
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
Boom. I'm going to.

623
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,700
Call Fox with the results.

624
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,900
Will do.

625
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,200
Mrs. Franklin.

626
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,500
Yes, this is Cutty.
I have some good news.

627
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,200
I've tracked down Jace.
He's fine.

628
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,300
His work evacuated
after the explosion.

629
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,100
He left his phone behind.

630
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,500
It's my pleasure.

631
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,700
Let me know if
I can do anything for you.

632
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,300
Bye.

633
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,700
So this is why you're not
returning my calls.

634
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,200
I'm kind of busy.

635
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,800
We're helping the families
that lost people today.

636
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,500
Wilkins is on board.

637
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:23,000
He's going to get food donations
from all the local restaurants.

638
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,800
Simone Clark.

639
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,400
James Murray.

640
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,200
Met your new bride
over at the station.

641
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,600
You work fast.

642
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,300
Hey, when you know, you know.

643
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,900
Wesley, this is Cutty's daughter
Simone, my first crush.

644
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,800
She was a few grades
ahead of me at school,

645
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,600
and I was heartbroken
when she went away to college.

646
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,700
That's me, a trail of broken
hearts in my wake.

647
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,300
Well, it's good to meet you.

648
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,700
I heard you're working
the bombing case.

649
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
I am, which is the reason
why I stopped by.

650
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,900
Daddy, do you still play chess

651
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,300
with your Russian jazz buddies
in the park?

652
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,300
The Redfellas?

653
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,300
I haven't missed a game
in 10 years.

654
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,800
Do you think one of them could
translate this for me?

655
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,400
It's some sort of
a Russian energy bar,

656
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,600
but I've been looking it up
online

657
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,000
and can't find it anywhere.

658
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,200
That's 'cause
you spelled it wrong.

659
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,000
You speak Russian?
Know a little.

660
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,400
But I've seen a bunch of
these candy wrappers.

661
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,200
My buddy Pavel, well,
he loves these.

662
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,700
Krovfeta.

663
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,400
And it's not an energy bar.

664
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,700
It's a Soviet-era candy bar
made with cow's blood.

665
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,100
Okay, that's nasty.

666
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,100
But where would one buy
this Soviet blood candy?

667
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,800
Only place I can think is...
over by the Aquarium.

668
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,000
There's a Russian deli there.

669
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,400
Okay.

670
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,900
Boom! Found it.
Thank you.

671
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,600
Wait, wait, wait, hold up.

672
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,300
You promised me that you would
stay inside where it's safe.

673
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,100
I did no such thing.

674
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,700
But if it'll make you feel
better, I'll call backup.

675
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,300
Hey, what's up?

676
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,700
See how he answers his phone
when I call?

677
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
John, you ever had a pierogi?

678
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,500
I've never had them. Me either.

679
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,900
But why don't you meet me

680
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,200
over at the Russian deli
near the Aquarium?

681
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,800
We're gonna follow up on a lead.

682
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,900
What kind of lead? It's a long shot,

683
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,600
but the good news is
you can buy me dinner.

684
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,000
I'm three minutes away.

685
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,700
He's here.

686
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,900
I'm in the car outside the deli,
and he's walking towards me.

687
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,400
Okay, stay in your car.

688
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,900
We'll lose him.

689
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,900
You're still a trainee.
You don't have a weapon.

690
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,100
Stay in your car.

691
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,200
I can't.

692
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,100
Simone!

693
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,000
Excuse me.

694
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,400
My boyfriend...
Okay, that's a lie.

695
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,900
He's not my boyfriend...

696
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,000
Just this cute guy named John
that I've been seeing...

697
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,100
Asked me to meet him
at the Aquarium,

698
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,600
and then I got turned around
'cause I dropped my phone

699
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,000
and now everything's in German.

700
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,400
And I don't speak German, so...

701
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,000
Hell, you looking at me like
I don't speak English.

702
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,900
Move.

703
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,900
Is that how you talk to a lady?

704
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,200
I know your mama raised you
better than that.

705
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,100
All I'm asking you to do is tell
me which way the Aquarium is.

706
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,800
Hey!

707
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,400
You okay?
No.

708
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,000
Embarrassed he got
on top of me so fast.

709
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,400
See which way he went?
That way.

710
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,800
7-Adam-15.

711
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,000
Bombing suspect last seen
heading south on Chestnut

712
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,100
towards the Aquarium.

713
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
Go, go, go!

714
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,800
Shoot.

715
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,900
I think I'm in trouble.

716
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,200
Hey, I was just getting ready
to call you.

717
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,400
Where the hell are you?

718
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,700
You were supposed to
hang with the DNA.

719
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,900
Anders said you ran out of there

720
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,700
talking about
Russian candy bars.

721
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,500
What had happened was

722
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,500
I went back down
to see Zeke earlier

723
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,400
when I told you
I was going to the bathroom,

724
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,700
and he remembered something.

725
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,100
Long story short,
I found Ilya and I lost him.

726
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,700
But I'm with Nolan now,
and we're on the hunt.

727
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,300
We're gonna have
a long conversation about this

728
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,300
when this is over.
Looking forward to it,

729
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,500
but right now, we gotta
run down a terrorist.

730
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,000
Tell me.

731
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,300
Cops have a possible
location on Ilya.

732
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,800
Near the Aquarium. We're heading there now.
What do you want us to do?

733
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,600
Get there first
and put him down.

734
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,900
It could get messy.

735
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,400
Messy I can clean.

736
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,800
If Ilya isn't dead
before the cops get there,

737
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
we're all going to prison.

738
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,800
I expect you're here
to apologize.

739
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,800
- For what?
- For what?

740
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,600
Interfering
with company business,

741
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,100
abducting a case officer.

742
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,600
I want Kate Hill back,
by the way.

743
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,700
Kate Hill? She's the least
of your problems.

744
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,900
We found a hairbrush
in Ilya Sokurov's car...

745
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,200
The car he directed us to
by calling 911.

746
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,200
We ran the hair for DNA.
And it was yours.

747
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Only question is
why was it yours?

748
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,700
What's your relationship
with Ilya?

749
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,300
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

750
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,100
I think you do. In fact, I think
you're Ilya's real target.

751
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,300
I mean, why else would he plant
your DNA in his car?

752
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,700
To hang himself around your neck

753
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,300
because he blames you
for something.

754
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,200
Which means you lied to us
earlier.

755
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,000
You know exactly who he is
'cause he used to work for you.

756
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,400
You ran Enervo
as an unsanctioned operation,

757
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,500
'cause why else would you be
so desperate to hide it?

758
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,900
We're done.
I'm late for dinner.

759
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,100
You're missing dinner.

760
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,200
Suspect's going into
the Aquarium.

761
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,400
We're in foot pursuit.

762
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,300
Game faces on, gentlemen.

763
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,500
We're one minute out.

764
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,900
I assume you're
handgun-qualified.

765
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,600
Yeah.

766
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,900
This place is creepy at night.

767
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,800
Feels like these fish got
something against me.

768
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,900
Like they know something
they're not telling me.

769
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,500
It's not the fish
I'm worried about.

770
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,900
Is it the mass-murdering
terrorist?

771
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,800
Yep.

772
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,900
Show me your hands.

773
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,300
It's over.

774
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,800
That's right, it is.

775
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,500
So show me your damn hands.

776
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,800
I need you to hear my story,

777
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,600
so that when they kill me,
it won't die with me.

778
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,200
And I need to put cuffs on you.

779
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,400
So put your hands on your head,

780
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,400
nice and slow.

781
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,300
Does your story include why you
planted a man's hairbrush in your car?

782
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,900
He's not a man.

783
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:02,100
He's a monster.

784
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,300
And he promised
he would take care of them

785
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,600
if anything happened to me.

786
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,700
Take care of who?

787
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,500
My wife.

788
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,300
My li...

789
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,200
My little girls.

790
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,400
But when I was arrested,

791
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,900
Bill August walked away.

792
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,600
He shut down the Enervo program,

793
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,700
and he left them.

794
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,800
To be rounded up and killed.

795
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,200
I feel for you.

796
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,400
But that doesn't make
what you did right.

797
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,400
All those people you killed...
They have families, too.

798
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,400
It was necessary.

799
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,600
After what he did to me...

800
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,600
The innocents he destroyed?

801
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,000
I had to tear him down.

802
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,400
Burn everything he built.

803
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,200
Killing him
wouldn't have done that.

804
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,800
We need to move, now.

805
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,000
Get down!

806
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,000
We are seriously outgunned!

807
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,500
Simone.

808
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Over there, over there.

809
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,300
Hands up!

810
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,300
Drop the gun!

811
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,900
Do it now!
Get up! Drop it!

812
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,600
Get up! Hands in the air!
Turn around!

813
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm gonna need those cuffs back.

814
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,200
Let me guess.

815
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,500
Don't tell me I need to do
some more exercise.

816
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,100
That's just basic science,
but what do you say,

817
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,700
maybe we get drunk first?

818
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,400
Now you're talkin'.

819
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,100
You are the worst
new Agent trainee

820
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,900
in the history of the Bureau.

821
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,200
Yes, sir.

822
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,800
You're unconventional,
you're stubborn,

823
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,300
and you... you... you...
You possess a...

824
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:48,400
An almost pathological inability
to follow protocol.

825
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,000
Yes, sir. But I did help
catch a terrorist,

826
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,800
a rogue CIA agent,
and his evil-ass hit squad,

827
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,200
so it should kind of
balance itself out, right?

828
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,200
This time.

829
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,900
Thank you, sir.

830
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,600
And it was an honor
to work for you.

831
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,700
I'll be keeping tabs on you.

832
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,900
I mean, I'm not gonna put
my thumb on the scale

833
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,100
with the Academy,
but if you do manage

834
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,300
to make it through, who knows?

835
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,800
Maybe you'll come
work for me again?

836
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,600
In your new unit?

837
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,000
My...

838
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,300
Loose lips, Agent Fox?

839
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,200
Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.

840
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,800
I'm kind of hard to resist.

841
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,800
Agent Fox.

842
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,100
Trainee Clark.

843
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,800
Hey, what are you doing here?

844
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,700
When have I ever not driven you
to the airport

845
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,200
after a visit?
True.

846
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,700
Seeing you wear that seal is...

847
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,600
just never gonna feel right.

848
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,200
Well, get used to it, Daddy,
'cause this is who I am now.

849
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,300
Come on.

850
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,100
I make this uniform look cute.

851
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,200
Thought you might need a ride
to the airport.

852
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,700
That's sweet of you,
but my daddy's gonna take me.

853
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,500
Nice to see you again, sir.

854
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,400
My daughter said
you saved her life.

855
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,600
And she saved mine.

856
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,600
I'll pull the car around.

857
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,000
So...

858
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,900
We know the real reason
you stopped by.

859
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,000
You wanted to get one last look
before I go.

860
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I'd be a fool not to.

861
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,700
Excited to get back
to the Academy?

862
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,400
I'm kind of scared, actually.

863
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,400
I mean, I've wanted this
my whole life,

864
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,100
and now that I got
a taste of it...

865
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,700
Working a case,
making a difference...

866
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,700
It's addictive, isn't it?

867
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,800
Like nothing
I've ever felt before.

868
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,000
I want to let you in
on a little secret.

869
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,600
That feeling never goes away.

870
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,800
That's what scares me. What if
I don't survive Quantico?

871
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,600
You will.
But if I don't.

872
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,000
Come on. If you don't
survive Quantico?

873
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,600
I think you mean if Quantico
can survive you.

874
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,200
Simone Clark,
you are a force of nature.

875
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,000
Words of affirmation.

876
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
How'd you know
that's my love language?

877
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,600
Lucky guess.

878
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,400
See you around, handsome.

879
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,500
I hope so.

880
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,400
Let's ride.
