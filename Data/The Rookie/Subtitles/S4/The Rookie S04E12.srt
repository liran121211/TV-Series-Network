1
00:00:06,354 --> 00:00:07,964
I hate beach calls.

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,270
Getting this close
to the water

3
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:11,489
without being able to dive in
is torture.

4
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,752
Not for me.

5
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:15,145
It's no surprise
there.

6
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:16,712
Hating one of nature's
greatest gifts

7
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:18,235
is totally on-brand
for you.

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,064
I don't hate the beach.
I'm just not a fan of the ocean.

9
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:22,326
You know,
psychologically speaking,

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,980
fear of the water equates
to a fear

11
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,113
of not being in complete control
of your environment.

12
00:00:26,156 --> 00:00:28,071
Again, on-brand.
Uh, you know, also,

13
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:30,117
good luck
dating a lifeguard.

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,901
Hey, Ash.

15
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:33,598
Hey.

16
00:00:33,642 --> 00:00:35,122
Wow. When I called
for the cops,

17
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:37,037
I didn't expect them
to send their best.

18
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:40,214
And hottest.

19
00:00:40,257 --> 00:00:42,912
Uh,
so you called about a...

20
00:00:42,955 --> 00:00:45,088
Yeah.
It's right over here.

21
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:48,787
Did you hear her say
"the hottest"?

22
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:55,142
Washed up an hour ago.
A couple kids found it.

23
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:56,969
That's why I don't swim
in the ocean.

24
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:58,884
It's a dumping ground
for sewage, narcotics,

25
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:01,191
and human remains.

26
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:02,845
Still feel like going in?

27
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:09,373
♪

28
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,984
You offer French <i>
and</i> Mandarin?

29
00:01:12,028 --> 00:01:14,161
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>and you don't have to choose.</i>

30
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:16,467
<i>If Jack is admitted</i> <i>

31
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:18,252
<i>he could study both.</i>

32
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,601
He'd be three
when he starts here.

33
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22,343
This all sounds amazing.

34
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:24,040
My pre-school was
my aunt's apartment,

35
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,782
where she watched me
and seven of my cousins.

36
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:29,611
<i>That must've been so much fun.</i>

37
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:33,354

40

<i>And where better to</i>

41
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:43,929
I can see why
they call this place

42
00:01:43,973 --> 00:01:45,627
the Harvard
of pre-schools.

43
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,107
<i>We like to think</i> <i>
of Harvard</i>

44
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,631
<i>as the Franklin Crest</i> <i>
of universities.</i>

45
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:51,372
And what do you do

46
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:53,896
to keep the kids from becoming
overprivileged monsters?

47
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:56,855
What are you doing?

48
00:01:56,899 --> 00:01:59,031
I went to schools
like this most of my life.

49
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:00,946
Most of the kids were awful,
entitled.

50
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,862
And rich and successful.
Be nice.

51
00:02:03,906 --> 00:02:06,778
I'm sorry. We're having trouble
with the audio on our end.

52
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:08,650
We were talking
about Harvard.

53
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:12,915
<i>Right. 80% of our students</i> <i>
attend Ivy League schools.</i>

54
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,525
Oh, and that's
a selling point?

55
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,223
The Ivy League is
a breeding ground

56
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:17,311
for even more entitlement.

57
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:20,314
<i>I went to Harvard.</i>

58
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:21,619
Well...

59
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:22,838
What was --

60
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:24,970
Sorry --
Frozen --

61
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:27,712
You know -- call -- back.

62
00:02:29,105 --> 00:02:30,933
What the hell
are you doing?

63
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,848
Look, I know you are dying
to send Jack here,

64
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:34,066
but we need to make sure
it's a healthy environment.

65
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:38,941
I have to get to work.

66
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:42,074
Call them back and reschedule
the rest of the interview.

67
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:44,251
Sometimes I just can't believe you.

68
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,951
Hey!
Oh, congratulations!

69
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,910
John Nolan,
Union Delegate.

70
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:53,303
How do you feel?

71
00:02:53,347 --> 00:02:55,044
I feel amazing.
This is incredible.

72
00:02:55,087 --> 00:02:56,654
Guys, you didn't do this
all yourselves, did you?

73
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,265
Oh, my goodness.
No.

74
00:02:58,308 --> 00:02:59,875
Uh, they were just left
at the front desk.

75
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:02,530
Oh. "To LAPD's
newest union delegate.

76
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,401
From your friends
at the mayor's office."

77
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:05,663
Wow.

78
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:07,622
I am so happy for you.

79
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:11,321
John, you worked
really, really hard to get this,

80
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:14,237
and I think you are gonna do
just an amazing job.

81
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:15,934
Thank you. That --
That actually means a lot to me.

82
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,414
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yeah.

83
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:21,244
Uh, it's -- it's, uh,
the pregnancy hormones.

84
00:03:21,288 --> 00:03:24,378
They -- They make me,
uh, pathologically cheerful.

85
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:25,944
Oh.
So, um...

86
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,859
Seriously,
it's the worst thing.

87
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,775
Um, I am gonna go
set up the shop,

88
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,517
and I will let you all
deal with this long line.

89
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:36,346
What long line?
Oh, yes.

90
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,218
So, in honor of your first day
as union delegate,

91
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:41,133
half the cops
in the station want to, um --

92
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:43,310
well, they --
they want to talk to you.

93
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:44,789
That's what I'm gonna talk
to him about.

94
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:48,793
They haven't restocked
the vending machine

95
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:50,142
with cheese puffs
in six months.

96
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:51,535
I need my puffs.

97
00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:53,407
A citizen just filed
a complaint.

98
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,538
I need you
to represent me.

99
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:56,018
So, what was
the complaint?

100
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:58,020
I was taking a statement
from a homeowner,

101
00:03:58,063 --> 00:03:59,978
and, well, I needed to use
her bathroom,

102
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:01,371
and now she's claiming
that I destroyed her toilet.

103
00:04:01,415 --> 00:04:04,548
I want to use a .44 Magnum
as my duty weapon.

104
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:07,334
When are we getting
air-conditioned body armor?

105
00:04:07,377 --> 00:04:11,251
I'm just looking to get my
emotional support pig deputized.

106
00:04:11,294 --> 00:04:13,383
Seriously?

107
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,472
You had this job
yesterday.

108
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:18,127
Already cracking
under the stress, Nolan?

109
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,911
No. I'm just wondering
what you were doing

110
00:04:19,955 --> 00:04:21,696
for the last 12 years
as union rep.

111
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:24,089
It seems like none of these
people's needs were being met.

112
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:27,267
Yeah, cops always find something
to whine about.

113
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,138
Plus,
I told everybody

114
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,662
how eager you are
to hear their problems.

115
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:33,708
No matter how small.
You're welcome.

116
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:38,060
Already hard at work,
I see.

117
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:39,235
Yes, sir.

118
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,932
Lieutenant Landon Briggs.

119
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,064
I'm the Union --President.

120
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:43,892
Yes, I know.
Great to finally meet you.

121
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:46,111
Consider this
a welcome present.

122
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:49,332
But my small gift
is only the beginning.

123
00:04:49,376 --> 00:04:52,074
You're about to be
wined and dined
across this great city.

124
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:54,337
I've already received
a-a few gifts,

125
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:55,904
but I'm just excited
to get started.

126
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:57,122
I-I'm glad you
stopped by.

127
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:58,602
What's a good e-mail
for you

128
00:04:58,646 --> 00:05:00,430
so I can send you a list
of my proposals?

129
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:02,954
- I'm sorry -- proposals?
- Yeah.

130
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:05,261
I, um, campaigned
on the promise of change.

131
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,829
At the top of the list
is a mental health initiative

132
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,918
that dispatches counselors
on all calls

133
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,006
involving mental illness.

134
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:13,051
Oh, slow down there, son.

135
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:15,750
Our fight right now isn't about
the people out there.

136
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:18,361
It's about making sure
our brothers in blue

137
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:21,495
get everything they deserve --
uh, paid overtime, benefits.

138
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,453
Eh...

139
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,976
there'll be time
for your list later.

140
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,371
The most important thing now
is to relax.

141
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:29,677
Enjoy your victory.

142
00:05:32,984 --> 00:05:34,769
Hey. Heard about that hand
that washed up yesterday.

143
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:37,162
God, I know.
It's super gross, right?

144
00:05:37,206 --> 00:05:39,164
You got any theories?

145
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,515
A couple. I...

146
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,778
At first, I was thinking
maybe human trafficking,

147
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,736
maybe the boat capsized,
took someone's hand off,

148
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,173
but then I realized that
the way the hand was severed

149
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:50,393
- spoke more
to some type of torture.
- Ah.

150
00:05:50,437 --> 00:05:52,700
Sorry, I
watch a lot of true crime.

151
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:53,701
Oh, me, too.

152
00:05:53,744 --> 00:05:55,224
I'm actually thinking

153
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:57,618
it's a "Gone Girl" gone wrong
scenario.

154
00:05:57,661 --> 00:05:59,359
Ooh, I like that.

155
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:02,100
Yeah, maybe she was, uh,
trying to fake a drowning,

156
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:03,841
but then got caught
in her boat propeller.

157
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:06,453
Exactly, yeah.
Nice.

158
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:08,063
- I'll see you around.
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:06:08,106 --> 00:06:09,456
Hey.
Hi.

160
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,414
What's that look?

161
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,198
N-Nothing.
What?

162
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,896
You wanted to strangle that guy
last week.

163
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:17,246
Now you're all sweet on him?
"Sweet on him"?

164
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:20,380
What? Did -- Did we suddenly
just get dropped in the 1950s?

165
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:23,252
What?
All done.

166
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:25,950
Who knew a dead hand
would require so much paperwork?

167
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,865
Oh, hey,
do you have plans tonight?

168
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,432
No. Why?

169
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:31,826
My friend Olive won
four raffle tickets

170
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:34,698
to this fancy dinner thing,
and she just invited us.

171
00:06:34,742 --> 00:06:36,396
What's a "fancy dinner thing"?

172
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:38,049
It's called Osia.

173
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,182
It's an exclusive pop-up
on the beach in Malibu --

174
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:42,053
one night only,
12 fusion courses,

175
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,577
wine pairings
included.

176
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,840
"An experiment
in molecular gastronomy."

177
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:47,581
I'll have to
think about it.

178
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:49,974
What's there
to think about?

179
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,672
Uh, the control freak
in him

180
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:53,630
doesn't like to try
new things, so...

181
00:06:53,674 --> 00:06:54,805
I'm not
a control freak.

182
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,419
I would be happy
to go to your dinner thing.

183
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:03,945
Sergeant Grey?

184
00:07:05,337 --> 00:07:07,470
Lieutenant...
Caba-relli?

185
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:09,167
It's <i>Cabarelli.</i>
Ah.

186
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,082
But call me Romeo.

187
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,345
Uh, thank you.
Wade.

188
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,565
- And how was your flight?
- Eh, good, I suppose.

189
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:17,437
A little tight perhaps.

190
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,221
The <i>Carabinieri</i> does not pay
for business class.

191
00:07:19,264 --> 00:07:22,093
- You're talking to a large man.
Trust me, I understand.
- Yeah.

192
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:25,096
So, you're hunting a fugitive.
Tell me about him.

193
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,663
Kai Zullo.

194
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:29,753
Murdered a woman
in a home invasion in Rome.

195
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:32,495
Made off with 100,000 Euros
worth of diamonds.

196
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:34,541
Landed in Los Angeles
three days ago.

197
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,325
Does he have any family
or friends here?

198
00:07:36,368 --> 00:07:38,675
No. We believe he wants to hide
in a large city

199
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,764
until he can escape
to South America.

200
00:07:40,808 --> 00:07:42,113
He's fluent
in many languages.

201
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:44,159
Well, he came
to the right place.

202
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:46,640
You can hide another city
in this city.

203
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,642
But the LAPD's pretty good
at finding people.

204
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,600
Listen, I don't want to be
a burden.

205
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:52,297
I'm sure
you're stretched thin.

206
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:56,127
I simply need an
escorting officer with a pulse.

207
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:59,087
Not to sing my own praises,
but I'm an expert lawman.

208
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,266
Look, I have no doubt,
and I <i>am</i> stretched very thin,

209
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:07,008
but it would be my honor
to work this case with you.

210
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:09,358
I can't possibly ask you
to do that.

211
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,968
I insist.

212
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:13,014
I'm always looking for a way
to stretch my legs.

213
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,537
Yeah, I do the same.

214
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,452
So here's
your carry permit.

215
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,456
And, you know,
I have a C.I. we can go see.

216
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,414
And you can tell me more
about our suspect on the way.

217
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,591
And when did the break-in
take place, Mr. Swaine?

218
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,680
Around 2:00 a.m.

219
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:27,985
Okay,
what was taken?

220
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,726
I can't say.

221
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,206
I'm -- I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

222
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:32,512
Well, if I told you,

223
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:35,079
I'd be revealing ManMade Labs'
trade secrets.

224
00:08:35,123 --> 00:08:36,777
My company works
at the forefront

225
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,519
of biotechnological
advancement.

226
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:42,434
You're asking me to reveal
highly confidential information.

227
00:08:42,478 --> 00:08:44,480
Okay. Can you at least tell me
who was working at that time?

228
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,438
I'll have to check with
the lawyers on that one.

229
00:08:46,482 --> 00:08:48,266
How about showing me
where the burglary happened?

230
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,746
That way, we can have TID
dust for prints.

231
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,443
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

232
00:08:51,487 --> 00:08:53,315
We have several
government clients.

233
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:56,144
You don't have clearance
to go farther than the lobby.

234
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:57,928
We can't do our job
without access.

235
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:00,757
Oh, was I --
was I not clear?

236
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,454
I don't expect you to.

237
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:05,849
I-I just need a case number
for insurance purposes.

238
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,590
Sorry I'm late.
I had to yell at my husband.

Detective Angela Lopez.

240
00:09:10,114 --> 00:09:12,464
Devon Swaine, CEO.

241
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:14,510
I apologize you had to come
all the way down here.

242
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,338
As I was telling
this officer,

243
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:18,601
this matter's
extremely sensitive.

244
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:21,125
We'll be handling it
in-house.

245
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:22,474
You can send over
that case number

246
00:09:22,518 --> 00:09:23,650
whenever you get
the chance.

247
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,260
Thanks.

248
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,051
How do you want to
handle this?

249
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:35,879
If they don't want our help,
there's not much we can do.

250
00:09:35,923 --> 00:09:38,099
Just write it up
and send it over.

251
00:09:38,142 --> 00:09:39,796
We heard
you got a body.

252
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,493
Yeah. He'd already lost
a lot of blood

253
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,104
when he got here.

254
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:45,062
We did everything we could,
but he bled out.

00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:50,720

No.

might want to reconsider

now that one of his employees
turned up dead.

299
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:32,256
- Who?
- Mark Kilkea.

300
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,694
Someone cut off his hand to get
past the palm scanners

They left him for dead,
but he somehow managed

00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:40,743
to get himself up
and stumbled into a hospital

304
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,789
almost 24 hours later.

305
00:11:42,832 --> 00:11:44,965
That's horrible, but my client
has nothing to do with that.

306
00:11:45,008 --> 00:11:46,923
Maybe not,
but given the company's

307
00:11:46,967 --> 00:11:49,012
high-tech
security protocols,

308
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:50,405
there's no way
your client wasn't aware

309
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,624
that Kilkea palmed his way
into the office

310
00:11:52,668 --> 00:11:54,017
right before
the robbery.

311
00:11:54,061 --> 00:11:55,802
But you didn't share that,
did you?

312
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:58,195
In fact, according to
Mr. Kilkea's neighbors,

313
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:00,197
two security officers
from your company

314
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:02,678
showed up at our victim's door
right after the robbery.

315
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,897
As you are well aware,

316
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,116
my client's business
is highly proprietary.

317
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,118
Yep.
I looked into that.

318
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:10,686
According to your website,
the company you founded

319
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,516
is "a pioneering force in
biotechnological engineering,

320
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,562

Either you answer
my question,

325
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,571
or we will freeze

326
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:28,269
until we can obtain
a search warrant,

327
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,053
and you won't sell any widgets
until I say so.

328
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,838
Yeah, I'm not gonna
let you do that.

329
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:33,056
It's a crime scene.

330
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,884
It's my discretion
on how to process it.

331
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:36,364
Let me help you out.

332
00:12:36,407 --> 00:12:40,672
You created the fastest,
smallest microchip in the world,

333
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,065
and it's about to
go to market.

334
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,327

about right?

335
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,155
Where did you get that
information?

336
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,680
Well, they just don't give
these out to anyone.

337
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:50,334
What are the chips
used for?

338
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:53,337
To bridge the gap between
technology and biology,

339
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,122
and that's all
I'm going to say.

340
00:12:55,165 --> 00:12:57,646
And can you think of anyone
who would cut off a guy's hand

341

00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,053
insisting he was close
to a breakthrough,

348
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:14,968
begged me to let him access
our lab again.

349
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:16,926
I told him
to lose my number.

350
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,450
And how dangerous would you say
Chester Frey is?

351
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:22,410
He's the worst kind of crazy,
Detective.

352
00:13:22,453 --> 00:13:24,194
He's a zealot.

353
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,630
So, what's next?

354
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:26,893
Morning sickness,
food cravings?

355
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:28,633
All of it.

356
00:13:28,677 --> 00:13:31,636
If it is a pregnancy
side effect, I will get it.

357
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,465
But it's just all such
a blessing. Yeah.

358
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:36,511
Oh.

359
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,689
- John Nolan.

Well,

366
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:54,703
I do have a couple of ideas

Wow. Okay.
See, this is why I ran.

374
00:14:09,152 --> 00:14:11,067
A chance to talk

And thank you so much

Cool. Any sign

408
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:04,659
No. He left plenty
of evidence behind --

409
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,487
notebooks, computers.

410
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:08,619

what scientific breakthrough

- Yeah.

Any sign of Chester?
No.

415
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:23,069
So, Chester cut off
Mark Kilkea's hand,

416
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:25,114
and now there's a severed arm
in his house.

417
00:16:25,158 --> 00:16:27,160
- That's two victims.
- Afraid there's more.

418
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:29,727
Harper and Nolan found a freezer
with eight more arms inside.

419
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:32,948
So, is that four more victims,
or eight?

420
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,298
Six, I think.
Four right, two left.

421
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:36,908
On the initial exam,
the ME thinks

422
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,258
they were removed
post-mortem.

423
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,912
Two of them had clear signs
of decomposition.

424
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:43,045
So what?
He's a grave robber?

425
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,481
We don't know yet.

426
00:16:44,525 --> 00:16:46,048
Well, tell TID
to get a rush on the prints.

427
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,354
If we can get hits
on his victims,

428
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,051
it might tell us
where he got the limbs from

429
00:16:49,095 --> 00:16:51,053
- and who he targets.
- On it.

430
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,794
Detective Lopez.

431
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:57,668
What do you want,
Mr. Karga?

432
00:16:57,712 --> 00:17:00,193
Access to
Chester Frey's house.

433
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:02,238
He stole proprietary property
from my client,

434
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:04,458
- and I need to retrieve it.
- That would be a no.

435
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:05,850
This is
an active crime scene --

436
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,069
I don't think
you understand.

437
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,289
If my client's technology
is leaked,

438
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:12,814
it will destroy
a billion dollars' worth of R&D.

439
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:16,122
And the LAPD isn't exactly known
for its discretion,

440
00:17:16,165 --> 00:17:18,385
which is why we prefer
to handle everything in-house.

441
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:21,388
Look, I get it.
But I can't help you.

442
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:24,652
We're seizing everything
inside this house, Mr. Karga,

443
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:27,959
and if you even attempt to step
foot inside this perimeter,

444
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:30,136
you'll spend tonight
inside a jail cell.

445
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:33,574
Wouldn't want to dirty
that nice suit, would you?

446
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:38,057
And I would love to get
a look at Chester's computer

447
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,667
after TID is done
processing it --

448
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,451
you know, try to get
into his head.

449
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:42,800
You think Lopez
would let me?

450
00:17:42,844 --> 00:17:44,063
Doesn't hurt to ask.

451
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,456
It's Ash.

He showed me
my city through new eyes.

Like you are now.

497
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:29,298
"Used to know."

00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:37,279
Go home to your wife.

523
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:42,328
You know... Luna has
book club tonight.

524
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,112
I'm all yours.

525
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,290
I told a foodie friend I was
coming here, and they flipped.

526
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,510
And they said it sold out in,
like, 30 seconds.

527
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,076
How the hell
did you get tickets?

528
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,383
My friend won them
in a raffle.

529
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:57,038
I'm sorry, but who puts
a restaurant on the beach?

530
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,214
I mean, you're just asking for
sand in your food.

531
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,911
I don't get it.

532
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:03,131
For your first course,
we have Chef Celine Barris' take

533
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:05,394
on blinis and caviar --

534
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:08,223
a savory enoki pancake
with fruit of the forest roe,

535
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,182
and smoked Himalayan salt
espuma.

536
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:12,619
Enjoy.

537
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,754
- Was any of that English?
- Let me translate.

538
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:19,103
All you need to know

539
00:21:19,147 --> 00:21:20,496
is that that pancake
is made of mushroom,

540
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,019
which I know is not
your favorite, so I'm just --

541
00:21:22,063 --> 00:21:24,631
Ooh, no, take it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

542
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:26,720
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you don't like mushrooms.

543
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:28,374
Oh, it's okay.

544
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,550
I'm not the most adventurous
eater, either.

545
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:32,726
But once on vacation in Jamaica,
I did have curry goat.

546
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:35,337
Ooh.
Was his name Gerald?

547
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:38,340
God, shut up.
Don't.

548
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:39,559
It's nothing.

549
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:40,734
No, it's something.

550
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,215
Okay, we had
a 2-11 at a petting zoo.

551
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:46,043
All of the animals
got loose.

552
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,480
So, we --
we nab our suspect,

553
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:49,090
we him back to the shop,
and that's where we find --

554
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:51,658
Gerald the goat.
He is so cute.

555
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,573
And he's sitting
in Lucy's seat.

556
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:55,401
Well, because I forgot
that I had rolled down
the -- the window.

557
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,359
You know,
who knew goats could jump?

558
00:21:57,403 --> 00:21:59,187
Look, she tries to talk
him out of the shop,
but it's a goat, right?

559
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,232
So, she spends five minutes
making goat noises

560
00:22:01,276 --> 00:22:03,322
at this thing.

561
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,628
Yes, he called me
"goat whisperer" for
all of last February.

562
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:07,717
- It was great.
- The darn thing never moved.

563
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:10,067
Oh, you know, we finally had
to call animal control.

564
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,507
It's funny.

565
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:19,816
Thank you so much
for coming, Councilwoman.

566
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,123
Of course.
It is my pleasure.

567
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,864
You know, every time
that I've reached out

568
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:26,388
to one of my district's
union delegates,

569
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:28,434
they always brush aside
my invitations to talk.

570
00:22:28,477 --> 00:22:30,653
So imagine my surprise
when you actually seemed excited

571
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:32,481
to talk to me.
Oh, I am.

572
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:34,440
No, I-I campaigned
on the promise of change,

573
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,659
and I meant it.

574
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:39,314
Some of the best people
you could ever meet

575
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,794
are in the LAPD.

576
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:42,491
I would like the institution
to reflect that.

577
00:22:42,535 --> 00:22:44,101
How can I help?

578
00:22:44,145 --> 00:22:45,494
I'll be honest,
Councilwoman --

579
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:46,843
- Elena.
- Elena.

580
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:49,063
Math was never
my strong suit.

581
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:51,108
My brain bleeds
just looking at my taxes.

582
00:22:51,152 --> 00:22:53,067
But I was going over
our departmental budget,

583
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,635
and even I can see
we're putting a lot of money

584
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:57,332
in the wrong places.

585
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,899
You won't get an argument
from me.

586
00:22:58,942 --> 00:23:01,249
Now, at least 20%
of our service calls

587
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:04,208
are for mental health
or substance-use issues.

588
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:06,602
Now, these people
don't need to be policed.

589
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:08,343
They need
crisis intervention

590
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,780
and a counselor
dispatched to the scene.

591
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,869
I've been thinking about
a pilot program.

592
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,958
If you could help me get
an audience with the mayor --

593
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,569
I'm so sorry.
This is -- It's my first day.

594
00:23:16,612 --> 00:23:18,745
I'm already overstepping.
No.

595
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:20,834
Do not apologize.

596
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:23,532
Your empathy is --
it's genuine. I can tell.

597
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,012
Tell me more
about this program, please.

598
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:26,361
Alright.

599
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,015
Well, people don't like
the idea of experimenting

600
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,843
on the dead
for emotional reasons,

601
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,845
but it's an important tool
in the medical field.

602
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:33,934
Yeah,
I'm not arguing that.

603
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:35,631
All I'm saying is that
turning people into cyborgs

604
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:37,111
is how the world
is going to end.

605
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:39,418
So, then, I guess you
haven't volunteered

606
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:40,767
to be an organ donor
when you die?

607
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,551
Tim? No.

608
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:45,032
He wants to be cremated
and spread over Dodger Field.

609
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:47,513
I was joking
when I said that.

610
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:49,819
My ashes would screw up
the pH level of the grass.

611
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,778
I can't believe you actually
called and asked.

612
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:55,129
I like the Dodgers.
Yeah.

613
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:57,000
And for dessert,

614
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:59,786
we have a spherical
coconut-mango emulsion

615
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:02,397
with a dusting
of jalapeño essence.

616
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,485
Enjoy.

617
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:06,880
This is a joke, right?

618
00:24:06,923 --> 00:24:10,274
I mean, people don't actually
enjoy eating this food, do they?

619
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:14,061
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to --

620
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:15,715
Excuse me.
I need to use the restroom.

621
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:18,805
Whoa.

622
00:24:20,546 --> 00:24:22,156
Wade, please.

623
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,071
I feel bad,
making you waste your night

624
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,029
for what's likely
a goose chase.

625
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:27,640
This is my case.

626
00:24:27,683 --> 00:24:30,512
I'll take the burden
for the both of us.

627
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:32,732
I'm starting to feel like you're
trying to get rid of me.

628
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:36,518
No.
I'm loving our time together.

629
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:40,609
It's just that...it's not good
to work all the time.

630
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,306
You need to
enjoy life more.

631
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:45,919
That's one thing I've learned
after Santo died.

632
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:51,620
- There he is.
- I'll call for backup.

633
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,056

No, I didn't see.

He's a very dangerous man.

Good morning.

Franklin Crest e-mailed.

648
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:45,935
Their enrollment is suddenly
full for two years from now.

649
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:48,155
Okay, I'm sorry,
but if they are that sensitive

650
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:49,635
to questions about
their students,

651
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:51,419
then maybe we shouldn't
send Jack there.

652
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:53,160
We should send him
to public school.

653
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,510
Says the rich boy
who's never been to one.

654
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,599
Well, you went to
public school.

655
00:25:57,643 --> 00:25:59,253
You turned out great.

656
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,602
You're doing it again.

657
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:02,604
Wait, doing what?

658
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,606
Shoving your privilege
into your back pocket

659
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,869
when you can actually use it
for something good,

660
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:08,958
like the education
of our child.

661
00:26:09,002 --> 00:26:10,699
- That's not fair.
- But it's accurate.

662
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:14,660
Look, public school
can be wonderful.

663
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:17,750
- Then what's the problem?
- You took away our options.

664
00:26:17,793 --> 00:26:20,100
Even if Jack got into
Franklin Crest,

665
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:23,016
we might not have enrolled him,
but you sabotaged it

666
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:25,105
and essentially made
a decision without me.

667
00:26:25,148 --> 00:26:26,541
And why did you do it?

668
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,499
Because you have
private school baggage.

669
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:32,721
Okay. Fine.

670
00:26:34,114 --> 00:26:37,291
Maybe I do have
some...baggage.

671
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:39,380
Maybe I'm afraid that
our son will become

672
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:42,775
the same poster boy
for entitlement that I was,

673
00:26:42,818 --> 00:26:46,387
until I realized
I didn't like myself,

674
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,650
and I set out to become
the man that you love.

675
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:51,348
Mostly.

676
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:53,568
I'm just disappointed
that you didn't have more faith

677
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,178
in us as parents.

678
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,927

00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:06,712
<i>They will parade me through --</i>

680
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:09,236
Hey.
You're here early.

681
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,977
Yeah.
I couldn't sleep.

682
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,066
All I could think of
was this disembodied hand

683
00:27:13,109 --> 00:27:15,634
climbing into my bed,
so I've been here,

684
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,810
scrubbing through
Chester's video journals.

685
00:27:17,853 --> 00:27:19,333
You come
to any conclusions?

686
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:21,465
I try not to use the word
"crazy"...

687
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:24,164
He cut off a guy's hand and
reanimated a woman's dead arm.

688
00:27:24,207 --> 00:27:26,601
He's crazy.
Yeah.

689
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,256
Okay, so,
he shot this next video

690
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:31,562
the day before he cut off
Mark Kilkea's hand

691
00:27:31,606 --> 00:27:33,390
and used it
to break into ManMade Labs.

692
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:38,482
<i>I am here,</i>

Well,

716

- What do you need?
- Close the door.

Come here.

718
00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:41,720
I heard you were involved
in a shooting. You alright?

719
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,547
That was
my Italian counterpart.

720

He and I tracked down
his fugitive -- Kai Zullo.

But the second
Romeo saw the guy,

722
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:51,773

claimed he saw a gun.

723
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:53,166
- But you didn't.
- Correct.

724

your body cam?

725
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,473
Of course,
but there wasn't a good look.

726
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,127
I phoned Italy
last night.

727

Spoke to one of
their inspectors.

728
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:03,089
She told me that Romeo is
currently under investigation

729
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,873
for misconduct.

730
00:29:04,917 --> 00:29:07,223
- So he's a dirty cop?
- Seemingly.

731
00:29:07,267 --> 00:29:10,052
I think it's prudent that
we find Kai before Romeo does.

732
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:11,793
Okay, so what do we know
about Kai so far?

733
00:29:11,837 --> 00:29:13,795
He's in
a foreign country.

734
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:15,797
He appears not to have friends
or family here.

735
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:16,929
He has to stay under
the radar,

736
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:19,366
so he can't use a credit card
or his ID.

737
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:21,411
Right, but he is gonna need
a place to stay.

738
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,457
A no-tell motel
that accepts cash.

739
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,980

All three were from unclaimed
