We should celebrate.

You want to go to Vegas

Yes!

Pete,
you just finished saying

1057
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,260
you wanted to start being
a responsible adult.

1058

Yes. Yes.
That was New Pete.

But I'm Old Pete.

Old Pete is back

And Old Pete
wants to go to Vegas

1063
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:14,227

What do you think?
Should we go?
Yeah.

- Good luck, Chastity.
- Thanks!

1068

Later, nerd.
Thanks for having me.
