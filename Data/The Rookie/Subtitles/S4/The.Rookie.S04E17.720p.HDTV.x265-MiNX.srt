1
00:00:01,248 --> 00:00:03,207
Previously on "The Rookie"...
I'm pregnant.

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,252
I can't tell if you're joking.
I'm not.

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,384
When I get
my license back, I might...

4
00:00:06,427 --> 00:00:08,777
You want to do even more
pro bono work.

5
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:10,779
Rosalind Dyer,
female serial killer.

6
00:00:10,823 --> 00:00:12,216
Lucy. Caleb.
Hey.

7
00:00:12,259 --> 00:00:13,478
You put something
in my drink.

8
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:14,609
Shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

9
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,394
I've got her!

10
00:00:16,437 --> 00:00:18,744
You think the camera
in the barrel was for Caleb?

11
00:00:30,016 --> 00:00:34,107
7-Adam-15, show me Code 6
on a single vehicle TC.

12
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:40,722
Hey. I'm John.

13
00:00:40,766 --> 00:00:42,333
I'm here to help.

14
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,117
What's your name?

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,685
I-I-I'm Riley.
Templeton.

16
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,297
I-I can't find
my ph-phone.

17
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,125
It...

18
00:00:52,168 --> 00:00:54,083
I need to
call my husband.

19
00:00:54,127 --> 00:00:56,129
There's frozen food
in the tr-trunk.

20
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:57,348
Okay, well,
let's worry about

21
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,740
getting you out of
this car first, okay?

22
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:00,655
Hey, this is Riley.

23
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:02,396
We need to get
her out of there fast.

24
00:01:06,139 --> 00:01:08,837
That's a catastrophic
injury.

25
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:11,275
Riley, we're gonna get this door
open for you, okay?

26
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:12,667
And John's gonna sit in here
while we do.

27
00:01:20,022 --> 00:01:21,807
Hey. I'm just gonna
keep you company, alright?

28
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,983
Okay.
Okay, yeah.

29
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:25,637
Hang on.
Okay. Come here.

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,116
Don't look at that.
Don't look at that.

31
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,901
Look at me.
Focus on me right now.

32
00:01:28,944 --> 00:01:30,642
Uh, tell me
about your husband.

33
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:32,339
What's his name?

34
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,733
Harry.
Harry.

35
00:01:34,776 --> 00:01:37,257
He's gonna be so upset.

36
00:01:37,301 --> 00:01:39,912
He loved this car.

37
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:43,176
At least we have g-g-good
insur-insurance.

38
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:45,439
No, he's not
gonna be mad at all.

39
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:48,703
It was just an accident.
It happens to everyone.

40
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:51,053
And... what about
your kids?

41
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:52,707
Tell me about them.

42
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:55,406
We have one.

43
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,539
Royce.
Oh.

44
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:03,283
H-His P-Popsicles are melting
in the tr-trunk.

45
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:06,242
Oh, listen, I-I'm gonna make
sure he gets new ones, okay?

46
00:02:06,286 --> 00:02:10,072
So you don't have
to worry about that.

47
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:13,772
You're a very nice man,
John.

48
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:16,252
P-Please don't
give me a ticket.

49
00:02:16,296 --> 00:02:18,342
I-I-I'm really sorry.

50
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:20,605
Riley, you are
not getting a ticket.

51
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:24,913
Hey, Riley,
you stay with me, okay?

52
00:02:24,957 --> 00:02:27,394
Riley?

53
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,656
Riley.

54
00:02:35,707 --> 00:02:39,145
Bailey.

55
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:43,018
Uh... she's, um...

56
00:02:49,547 --> 00:02:51,679
You wanna call it?

57
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,989
Yeah. Uh...

58
00:02:57,032 --> 00:02:58,686
9:38.

59
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,688
Is she a donor?

60
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:02,386
Uh...

61
00:03:06,912 --> 00:03:08,957
Yeah. She is.

62
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:10,045
You guys wanna arrange
transport?

63
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:11,743
Yeah.
I'll get it started.

64
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,965
Control, Engine 113.
We have one victim, 10-5-5.

65
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:19,359
Advise Shaw Memorial
we're transporting a donor.

66
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:22,362
ETA six minutes,
9:38 hours.

67
00:03:22,406 --> 00:03:23,842
Details on the box.

68
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:26,148
Oh, God.

69
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,694
I'm Dr. Spader.

70
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:51,696
Were you able to talk to
the victim before she died?

71
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:53,175
Yeah.
Her name is Riley.

72
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:54,960
Was.
Was Riley.

73
00:03:55,003 --> 00:03:56,701
W-What are they doing?

74
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,485
It's an Honor Walk.

75
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,227
Our way of showing respect
for organ donors.

76
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,489
Are you gonna be
around for a while?

77
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,577
I have some questions.

78
00:04:03,621 --> 00:04:05,536
Yeah.
Great.

79
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,340
I know it's daunting rebuilding
your law practice from scratch,

80
00:04:27,383 --> 00:04:29,951
but I made you these
fancy cards,

81
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:31,953
so why you sweating?

82
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:34,695
They are nice.

83
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,044
Wesley Evers,
Attorney At Law.

84
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:37,219
Total Hunk.

85
00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:38,873
That last part's subtext.

86
00:04:40,309 --> 00:04:42,355
Don't get me wrong,
they're great,

87
00:04:42,398 --> 00:04:45,271
and I'm thrilled to finally
get my license back,

88
00:04:45,314 --> 00:04:48,753
but I have zero clients,
and no clients are lining up

89
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:51,103
to hire a lawyer that was just
disciplined by the State Bar.

90
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:54,062
Your client base is
sleazebags... no offense.

91
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:55,237
I think you're
gonna be fine.

92
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:56,630
Oh, the entire
criminal underworld knows

93
00:04:56,674 --> 00:04:58,414
that I dropped a dime
on Elijah.

94
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,460
I'll be lucky if they let me
handle their parking tickets.

95
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:02,114
Then find a better
brand of clientele.

96
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:03,419
You mean richer.

97
00:05:03,463 --> 00:05:05,378
Of course I do.

98
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:08,033
Rich people commit hella crimes,
and Mama needs a vacation house.

99
00:05:08,076 --> 00:05:09,643
Mm.

100
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:12,341
I was actually thinking about
advertising to get new clients.

101
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:14,866
Alright, picture this...
Buses, subways.

102
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,563
A sign with
my face on it.

103
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:20,915
And next to it,
"Best. Lawyer. Evers."

104
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,743
Go away.

105
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:24,092
I'm gonna take that
as an endorsement.

106
00:05:24,136 --> 00:05:25,659
I think you like that.

107
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:30,229
What's that smell?

108
00:05:30,272 --> 00:05:32,536
That depends.
Does it smell good?

109
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:34,842
Uh, it smells delicious.

110
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:35,800
Then it's your breakfast.

111
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:37,584
Ooh.

112
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:41,109
It's a Pop Tart
egg sandwich?

113
00:05:41,153 --> 00:05:42,937
I saw it on ClipTalk.
Oh.

114
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:46,419
Historically not my favorite
recipes, but, uh...

115
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:49,422
Mm-hmm.

116
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,035
Mm.

117
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,734
Okay.

118
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:59,345
That is a unique experience,
but it's not bad.

119
00:05:59,388 --> 00:06:00,955
What's all
the fuss about?

120
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:02,609
I just want today
to go well for you.

121
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:06,134
I appreciate that,
but it's gonna be fine.

122
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:07,788
It just seems so unnecessary
to dig through

123
00:06:07,832 --> 00:06:09,616
the worst moments of your life
just so the D.A.

124
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,487
can slap a few charges
on Rosalind Dyer.

125
00:06:11,531 --> 00:06:14,316
All the D.A. needs me to do
is tell them

126
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,622
everything that happened
so they can prove.

127
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,711
Rosalind was an accessory
in Caleb's crimes.

128
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:19,670
It's a story I've told
my therapist a hundred times.

129
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,019
But is it worth it

130
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:23,630
when she's already serving
four life sentences?

131
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:28,026
It's important that she's held
accountable for every crime.

132
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:30,550
Most of her victims
are dead.

133
00:06:30,594 --> 00:06:32,552
I'm fortunate to be
able to do so.

134
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:34,641
Okay.
But I'm coming with.

135
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,338
I'll have snacks in my bag

136
00:06:36,382 --> 00:06:37,818
and puppy videos on my phone
for when you need them.

137
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:39,907
Thank you.

138
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,780
You're the first person
I've ever heard of

139
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:45,696
who brings their own sheets
to the hospital.

140
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,263
Look, if we are gonna be hanging
around a hospital all day

141
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,918
waiting on tests, then we
might as well do it in style.

142
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:54,052
Okay, my girl Lisa got us
this private room.

143
00:06:54,095 --> 00:06:56,576
They are serving pizza
in the cafeteria.

144
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,099
It's a great day.

145
00:06:58,143 --> 00:06:59,492
I don't know.
I wouldn't go that far.

146
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:05,759
Okay. Look at me.

147
00:07:05,803 --> 00:07:07,239
Okay?

148
00:07:07,282 --> 00:07:11,765
Yes, I had a little bleeding
this morning,

149
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:18,076
but... we're here now,
and all we can do is wait

150
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,730
for my lab work
to finish up.

151
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,166
I get that.

152
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:23,081
And I'm not worried...

153
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:25,561
No, you just don't like
hospitals.

154
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:27,389
No one does.

155
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:30,741
Avoiding medical care is just
such a male instinct.

156
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,699
Mm, I'm not avoiding.
Mm.

157
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,396
I'm just healthy.

158
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,572
When is the last time
you got a complete physical?

159
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:38,400
Seeing the way you're
looking at me right now,

160
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:40,925
I-I think I'm gonna refrain
from answering that one.

161
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:45,886
Fine. Uh, six years.

162
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,410
- Thank you, Officer.
- Yeah.

163
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:50,891
My daughter Piper is
getting a new heart today.

164
00:07:50,935 --> 00:07:52,763
Dad.
What?

165
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,113
We thought this day
would never come, right?

166
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:56,723
Well, I'd say congratulations,
but that seems like

167
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,203
too small a sentiment.

168
00:07:58,246 --> 00:07:59,726
How about "Thank God"?

169
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,988
Amen.

170
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:10,171
It's one of
Mrs. Templeton's kidneys.

171
00:08:10,215 --> 00:08:12,173
Headed to Oklahoma.

172
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:14,828
That's something you
don't see every day.

173
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:16,525
Well, unless you're you.

174
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,092
I mean...

175
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:19,790
are all Riley's organs
going somewhere else?

176
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,662
No, I'm transplanting
her heart this afternoon.

177
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:24,359
I have a few questions
for you.

178
00:08:24,403 --> 00:08:27,188
Was Riley conscious when
you arrived at the scene?

179
00:08:27,232 --> 00:08:29,147
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
she was talking

180
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,757
right up until
the moment she passed.

181
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,585
Was she making sense?

182
00:08:32,628 --> 00:08:34,326
Well, she was in shock.

183
00:08:34,369 --> 00:08:38,243
Had no idea how serious
the accident was, but yeah.

184
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:40,854
She was worried her husband
would be mad about the car.

185
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:42,334
Hmm.

186
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:43,944
Do you have any reason
to suspect that

187
00:08:43,988 --> 00:08:46,381
she was under the influence
of alcohol or drugs?

188
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,382
No.

189
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,428
Okay. Good.

190
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,473
Good luck today.
Thanks, Officer.

191
00:08:51,517 --> 00:08:53,475
Excuse me.
I have to go meet my patient.

192
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,694
Of course.

193
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:57,131
Hey.

194
00:08:57,175 --> 00:08:59,003
Heard your fatal this morning
was a rough one.

195
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:00,831
Yeah.

196
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,703
Well, that girl is getting
a new heart because of it,

197
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:07,402
so hold on to that
silver lining if you can.

198
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,361
Her dad said they'd almost
given up hope

199
00:09:09,404 --> 00:09:10,928
that they'd ever
find a match.

200
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:13,539
Guess she has
a rare blood type.

201
00:09:13,582 --> 00:09:16,150
As a parent,
there is nothing scarier

202
00:09:16,194 --> 00:09:18,457
than being unable
to help your child.

203
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,807
Well, today is
their lucky day.

204
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,859
Um, I'm gonna
hit the restroom.

205
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,034
Do you want me
to come with you?

206
00:09:30,077 --> 00:09:31,600
I think I can handle it.

207
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:33,385
Will you let them know
that I'm here?

208
00:09:33,428 --> 00:09:35,039
Sure.
Okay.

209
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:55,973
Rock, Paper, Scissors?

210
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,105
You should
definitely go first.

211
00:09:58,149 --> 00:09:59,585
I have a tendency to
fold under pressure.

212
00:10:03,632 --> 00:10:05,765
Do you work here?
You look my age.

213
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:09,116
Oh, I'm a college intern.
Environmental Crime Unit.

214
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,857
Oh, cool.
What kind of cases do you do?

215
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,425
Well, water pollution,
mostly.

216
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,994
I don't want to boast,
but I'm actually

217
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:18,865
single-handedly
saving the Earth.

218
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,736
And you're
only an intern?

219
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,477
I mean, you might want to talk
to somebody about that.

220
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,478
Right?

221
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:26,917
Oh, uh, I gotta go.

222
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,833
It was nice meeting you.
Yeah. You... You, too.

223
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:31,747
Oh. Hey.

224
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,401
Hi.
Hey.

225
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:34,881
Um, d-do you know
where Sarah is?

226
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,622
I-I'm here
for trial prep.

227
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:38,015
I know.
She's out sick.

228
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:39,451
Oh.

229
00:10:39,494 --> 00:10:41,627
They asked me to step in,
but that seems awkward,

230
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,237
given our relationship.

231
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:44,630
I say we reschedule.

232
00:10:44,673 --> 00:10:48,068
No.
Um... we're professionals.

233
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:50,244
We're just discussing
the details of the case.

234
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:51,550
It'll... It'll be fine.

235
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,900
Okay.
Um, let's get to it.

236
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,380
Mm.

237
00:10:56,816 --> 00:10:58,339
Okay, sorry to
keep you waiting.

238
00:10:58,383 --> 00:10:59,732
It's been
a crazy morning.

239
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:02,039
Test results are in,
and

240
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:04,084
I'm so sorry to have to
tell you this,

241
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:06,347
but it looks like you
have prostate cancer.

242
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:08,828
Oh.
You're not Mr. Johnson.

243
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:11,091
Oh, no, no.
I am not.

244
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:12,614
Is this Room 516 East?

245
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:13,964
It is.
Mm-hmm.

246
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,879
I'm so sorry.

247
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:18,055
It looks like there's something
amiss with our system.

248
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:20,579
Well, better the system
than my prostate.

249
00:11:20,622 --> 00:11:22,929
We have a psychologist
on standby

250
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,322
if you need to
talk to someone.

251
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:26,759
This qualifies as Critical
Incident Stress Debriefing,

252
00:11:26,802 --> 00:11:28,848
so there's
no charge to you.

253
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:29,936
I think
I'll be alright.

254
00:11:34,462 --> 00:11:36,725
What's going on?
I don't know.

255
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,597
Our system is showing that
we have patients coding

256
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,425
in every room on this floor.

257
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:42,209
Gotta be a glitch, right?
A short?

258
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:44,995
No, it's not a glitch
or a short.

259
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,171
How do you know?
Because it's me.

260
00:11:47,214 --> 00:11:50,914
I've taken over
the entire network.

261
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,306
And the backup servers.

262
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,917
I have total control
of this hospital.

263
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,309
And what is it
you want?

264
00:11:57,877 --> 00:11:59,531
Riley Templeton's heart.

265
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:01,576
And if my wife
doesn't get the heart,

266
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,710
I'm gonna start shutting down
every system in this hospital,

267
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:06,146
and people start dying.

268
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,546
Here she is.
Where's the guy?

269
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:16,200
Jonah Russell is cuffed
and in a conference room.

270
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:17,984
An officer's watching him.

271
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:19,725
His wife, Meredith, is in
a patient room being examined.

272
00:12:19,768 --> 00:12:21,335
She's in
pretty bad shape.

273
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:23,990
This is Linda Brooks.
She runs the hospital.

274
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,297
Detective Lopez. I'll be
spearheading the investigation.

275
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,951
Can you give me
a status report?

276
00:12:27,994 --> 00:12:29,822
We got the alarms
turned off manually,

277
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,042
and we're canceling all
non-essential procedures,

278
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,740
but a full-scale evacuation
would be a massive undertaking.

279
00:12:34,783 --> 00:12:36,437
And we have critical-care
patients

280
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:37,917
who won't survive
being moved.

281
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:39,919
Evacuation's
the last resort.

282
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:42,269
I have our Cyber Crimes Unit
working with your IT head,

283
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:44,010
so hopefully, they can find
a way to force the guy out

284
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,707
before
anything else happens.

285
00:12:45,751 --> 00:12:47,971
While we're waiting on that,
take a run at the husband.

286
00:12:48,014 --> 00:12:49,624
See what kind of guy
we're dealing with.

287
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:50,930
Talk to the wife.

288
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:52,410
Use that Midwestern charm
to convince her

289
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:54,629
to stop her husband from
continuing this insanity.

290
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,718
I'm not actually from
the Midwest, but I'll...

291
00:13:01,985 --> 00:13:04,335
When will they
bring my husband in?

292
00:13:04,378 --> 00:13:05,814
They won't.

293
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:08,904
He's being questioned pending
arrest, like you are now.

294
00:13:08,948 --> 00:13:12,038
I didn't know Jonah's plan.
I swear.

295
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,127
This morning, he just told me
to get in the car,

296
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,824
said we were going in
for a checkup.

297
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:20,786
I'm sorry.
For all this mess.

298
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:24,398
Well, that helps.
A little.

299
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:27,271
But you're gonna have to do a
lot more than say you're sorry.

300
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:30,622
You need to convince
your husband to stop this.

301
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:32,493
Now.

302
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:34,713
There's 800 patients
in this hospital.

303
00:13:34,756 --> 00:13:36,323
Dozens of them
in critical care.

304
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:39,196
Every moment that their
treatment is compromised,

305
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:40,762
any one of them
could die.

306
00:13:40,806 --> 00:13:44,375
He's only doing this
because he loves me.

307
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:48,161
I have a rare blood type
and I've had cancer.

308
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:51,034
That's why I'm so low
on the list.

309
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:54,863
Without a new heart,
I only have a few weeks left.

310
00:13:54,907 --> 00:13:57,779
I-I understand.

311
00:13:57,823 --> 00:14:00,521
I do.

312
00:14:00,565 --> 00:14:05,265
But what your husband is doing
is going to hurt people.

313
00:14:05,309 --> 00:14:07,050
Is your life worth more
than theirs?

314
00:14:07,093 --> 00:14:10,009
No.
No, of course not.

315
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:12,968
Then you need to
tell Jonah to stop.

316
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:17,582
I don't want to die.

317
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,673
I'm sorry.

318
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:23,066
Meredith...

319
00:14:23,109 --> 00:14:25,329
I need to rest.

320
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:27,070
Are you prepping
my wife for surgery?

321
00:14:27,113 --> 00:14:28,941
No, and they're
not going to.

322
00:14:28,984 --> 00:14:30,986
You need to
end this now.

323
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,902
As soon as my wife gets
her heart, it all stops.

324
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:36,862
But if anything happens to her
because you're wasting my time

325
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:38,385
trying to talk me out of this,
then I'm...

326
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:39,821
I'm gonna fry
the whole system.

327
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:40,545
I'm... I'm gonna kill
this hospital.

328
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:43,169
Let's dial back
the threats, okay?

329
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:45,563
So far, all you've really done
is hack the hospital's network

330
00:14:45,606 --> 00:14:47,782
and disrupt
one alarm system.

331
00:14:47,826 --> 00:14:50,742
Now, you cooperate now, charges
against you won't be so bad.

332
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:54,746
Do you really think that I care
about what happens to me?

333
00:14:54,789 --> 00:14:57,444
Look, my wife has been
my whole life for 30 years,

334
00:14:57,488 --> 00:14:59,359
and for the last two,
I've watched her

335
00:14:59,403 --> 00:15:02,318
get sicker and sicker because
she needs a new heart,

336
00:15:02,362 --> 00:15:06,322
and I-I couldn't
help her.

337
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:07,628
But now I can.

338
00:15:07,672 --> 00:15:09,238
What time is it?
Why?

339
00:15:09,282 --> 00:15:11,023
Because I need to enter the
abort code into the tablet

340
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:14,200
by 10:45, otherwise phase two
of the attack begins,

341
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:17,246
and then people really will,
uh, start to get hurt.

342
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,161
That's in 20 seconds.
What's gonna happen?

343
00:15:20,989 --> 00:15:22,382
You'll see.

344
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,956
What the...

345
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,740
What's going on?

346
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:38,137
What's happening?

347
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,225
Our computers
just locked.

348
00:15:39,268 --> 00:15:40,748
We don't have access
to anything...

349
00:15:40,792 --> 00:15:43,664
Patient histories, medication
schedules, doctors' orders.

350
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,623
It's all gone.

351
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,233
Got anything?

352
00:15:48,974 --> 00:15:51,280
Excuse me.
Are you the officer in charge?

353
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:53,239
I'm Detective Lopez.
How can I help you?

354
00:15:53,282 --> 00:15:55,937
Well, I'm hearing some rumors
that some crazy guy

355
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:57,461
is trying to
take the heart

356
00:15:57,504 --> 00:15:59,245
that's supposed to go
to my daughter.

357
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:01,900
I'm sorry to say
you heard right.

358
00:16:01,943 --> 00:16:03,249
You must be Piper.

359
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:05,077
Yes. Um...

360
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,819
Please, no one will tell us
what's going on.

361
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:10,125
My daughter has been through
so much already.

362
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,518
We really
deserve some answers.

363
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:14,260
I'll tell you
what I can say.

364
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:17,916
A man has hacked into the
hospital computer network,

365
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:21,267
hoping to force the hospital to
give his wife the donor heart.

366
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,616
You can't let them.

367
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,096
It's not up to me.

368
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:25,967
It's not up to
the hospital, either.

369
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:27,882
I'm next on the list.

370
00:16:27,926 --> 00:16:30,406
By law, the hospital has to
give the heart to me.

371
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,407
Do you have a lawyer?

372
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:33,105
We don't have
money for that.

373
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:35,281
We spent all our savings
on her care.

374
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:37,152
I'm not allowed to
make a referral,

375
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,807
but I happen to know
Mr. Evers

376
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:42,506
has an annoying habit
of working for free.

377
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:44,595
Did you ever hear Caleb talking
to Rosalind on the phone?

378
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:47,249
Mm, no.

379
00:16:47,293 --> 00:16:49,904
Did he talk about her
as if they were communicating?

380
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:52,690
No.

381
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:56,258
So how can you be sure
he was working with her?

382
00:16:57,651 --> 00:17:00,045
Becau... Because she
told me herself

383
00:17:00,088 --> 00:17:01,829
when I visited her
in prison.

384
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:03,962
She repeated the song
I sang in the barrel.

385
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:05,354
How... How would
she know that

386
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:08,575
if her and Caleb
weren't in communication?

387
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,925
You know
I'm only asking you because...

388
00:17:14,712 --> 00:17:17,453
Lucy.
I just want you to be ready.

389
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:20,326
I'm familiar with
the concept of trial prep.

390
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,155
I know.

391
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:26,593
Uh, how about
we take a break?

392
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:27,681
Yeah.

393
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:31,903
I could
use some coffee.

394
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:34,383
Well, you're in luck.

395
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:35,820
We just got
a new coffee maker.

396
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:36,995
The old one
took a bullet.

397
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:38,562
New, huh?

398
00:17:38,605 --> 00:17:40,607
That's pretty fancy
for government work.

399
00:17:40,651 --> 00:17:42,435
Well, new for us.

400
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,698
I'm pretty sure it was born
before we were.

401
00:17:44,742 --> 00:17:46,700
Come on.

402
00:17:52,184 --> 00:17:54,795
Is this food for anybody,
or do you have to work here?

403
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,190
Oh, it's employees only,
but I won't tell.

404
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:00,627
What do you want?
Whatcha got?

405
00:18:00,671 --> 00:18:02,673
Well, if you
love preservatives,

406
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:04,022
you've come to
the right place.

407
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:05,632
Super bad for your health,
though,

408
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:08,374
and the packaging is
terrible for the planet.

409
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,636
Farming's no better.

410
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,072
If you wanna
get real about it,

411
00:18:11,116 --> 00:18:12,596
you're trading packaging
for fertilizer.

412
00:18:12,639 --> 00:18:14,772
Oh, yeah. And meat's just
antibiotics and methane, so...

413
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,124
So, basically, we have to learn
how to live on air.

414
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,343
Ooh,
can I have one?

415
00:18:21,387 --> 00:18:22,910
Sure.

416
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:24,564
I wondered where you went.

417
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:26,697
Two watery coffees,
coming up.

418
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,828
How's it going?

419
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:29,569
Uh, great.

420
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:31,745
This is Austin.
He's saving the planet.

421
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:34,313
Oh. Good to know
someone's doing it.

422
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:37,316
Um, you can go.
I-I'm fine here.

423
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,665
I don't know.

424
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:40,493
I'm finding this all
so fascinating.

425
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,496
You know, justice
and laws and stuff.

426
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,239
Uh-huh. And what exactly
is so interesting?

427
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,899
You okay?

428
00:18:59,686 --> 00:19:01,906
I'm so sorry.

429
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:04,343
It was in my head.
I wasn't thinking.

430
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:07,651
I-It was thoughtless and stupid,
and I'm sorry.

431
00:19:07,694 --> 00:19:12,220
The song was stuck
in your head because you've...

432
00:19:12,264 --> 00:19:14,179
because you've
seen the video.

433
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:17,138
Well, yeah.
It's evidence.

434
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:18,705
Right, right.
No, of course you did.

435
00:19:18,749 --> 00:19:22,709
You're in the D.A.'s office,
and it's evidence,

436
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:25,973
so... you've...

437
00:19:26,017 --> 00:19:27,496
Lucy, I should have
told you I'd seen it.

438
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,759
I'm sorry.

439
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:31,109
No, you said
that part already. Um...

440
00:19:31,152 --> 00:19:33,328
I just...
I just need a minute.

441
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:34,068
Lucy, p...

442
00:19:34,112 --> 00:19:36,201
Please, can you...

443
00:19:36,244 --> 00:19:38,246
Yeah.

444
00:19:45,645 --> 00:19:47,821
Knock, knock.
I have a favor to ask.

445
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:50,171
Our hospital
social worker's tied up.

446
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:53,784
Would you mind
keeping an eye on Rory here?

447
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:55,524
He took a fall
on a field trip.

448
00:19:55,568 --> 00:19:57,439
He seems okay now,
but the E.R. lost power

449
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:59,093
before
he could be examined.

450
00:19:59,137 --> 00:20:00,355
We're trying to get
in touch with his parents.

451
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,748
Of course.
Bring him in.

452
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:02,967
Thanks.

453
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,838
Hop on up into bed.

454
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,407
Good.

455
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,974
Okay.

456
00:20:10,017 --> 00:20:11,976
A doctor will be by
to check on him soon.

457
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:14,630
Hi, Rory.
I'm Nyla Harper.

458
00:20:14,674 --> 00:20:17,198
This is, um...

459
00:20:17,242 --> 00:20:20,724
Hmm. Well, so much for
a private room. Mm-hmm.

460
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:22,900
Sorry, sir.
Right now, we're nowhere.

461
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:24,205
Jonah's refusing
to back down.

462
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:25,554
What about the wife?

463
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:26,904
She knows what
he's doing is wrong,

464
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:28,166
but is too scared
of dying to stop it.

465
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:29,820
Any luck with
the Cyber guys?

466
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:31,996
No, but they've
confirmed that Jonah

467
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,606
has got a stranglehold on
the hospital's network.

468
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,564
Did FEMA get there? Just landed.

469
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:37,175
They're talking about
setting up a field hospital

470
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:38,350
in the parking lot.

471
00:20:38,393 --> 00:20:40,221
Best case...
That takes 24 hours.

472
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:41,701
We don't have
that kind of time.

473
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:43,921
Any intel on Jonah
that might help us?

474
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:46,401
No criminal history.
Master's degree from Cal Poly.

475
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,969
Ran an IT department
for a credit union

476
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:51,929
until his wife's illness
required full-time care.

477
00:20:51,972 --> 00:20:53,974
What about family?
Anything I can use for leverage?

478
00:20:54,018 --> 00:20:55,715
Anything he cares about
as much as her?

479
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:58,152
No parents,
no siblings, no kids.

480
00:20:58,196 --> 00:21:00,807
Coworkers describe him
as a loner.

481
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:04,811
His only police contact
was a 5150 hold in '09

482
00:21:04,855 --> 00:21:07,031
after she threatened
to leave.

483
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:08,728
She's his whole world.

484
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:11,252
Great. We should all be so lucky
to have such devotion.

485
00:21:11,296 --> 00:21:13,864
I got a meeting.

486
00:21:13,907 --> 00:21:15,779
Are you still able
to treat patients?

487
00:21:15,822 --> 00:21:17,345
Well, we're using
paper charts for now,

488
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,521
but almost everything
is hooked up to the network...

489
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:22,655
Records, pharmacy,
even surgical equipment.

490
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,396
How long before you
have to make a choice?

491
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:26,833
A human heart is only viable
for four to six hours

492
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:28,966
once it's been removed
from a donor's body.

493
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:31,403
I've already lost
two of those hours.

494
00:21:31,446 --> 00:21:33,187
So, I'm going to get prepped
for surgery,

495
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:36,843
because I am putting that heart
in someone in an hour.

496
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:39,759
It's up to you to decide
who my patient will be.

497
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:42,457
W... It has to be Piper,
right?

498
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,851
I mean, you can't just decide
who gets an organ.

499
00:21:44,895 --> 00:21:47,332
Excuse me.
I'm Wesley Evers.

500
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,855
I'm representing Graham Scott
and his daughter, Piper.

501
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:50,291
I need to
speak with you.

502
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:51,858
Uh, Mr. Evers,
now is not a good time.

503
00:21:51,902 --> 00:21:53,860
Now is the only time.

504
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:57,733
If your hospital decides to give
in to this terrorist's demands,

505
00:21:57,777 --> 00:21:59,735
to take away the heart that
has been promised to Miss Scott,

506
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:01,346
that is tantamount to
organ brokering.

507
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:03,391
If you continue
down this path,

508
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:04,958
I will file a report
with the medical board,

509
00:22:05,002 --> 00:22:06,873
and you will be st... Mr. Evers,
let me assure you,

510
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,833
I have no intention of giving in
to Mr. Russell's demands.

511
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:14,489
Can I get that
in writing?

512
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:15,969
Everything's down.

513
00:22:16,013 --> 00:22:17,971
Vents, cardiac monitors,
medicine drips.

514
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:19,146
Isn't there
a backup generator?

515
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,582
Yeah, but it
isn't coming on.

516
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,768
Help!

517
00:22:32,812 --> 00:22:35,554
I need some help
in here!

518
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:37,556
Someone! Help!

519
00:22:41,603 --> 00:22:43,649
I need oxygen.
15 liters.

520
00:22:58,142 --> 00:22:59,273
He's gone.

521
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:05,685
Meredith Russell gets the heart.
We're prepping the O.R. now.

522
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,426
Absolutely not.
We have no choice.

523
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,080
Yes, you do.

524
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:10,472
I have calls in to the OPTN
and the U.S. Health Department.

525
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:11,952
You will not
act until...

526
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:13,388
Look, do you think I feel
good about this?

527
00:23:13,432 --> 00:23:15,956
I don't.
Nobody does.

528
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,479
But I'm not gonna have
any more patients die

529
00:23:17,523 --> 00:23:18,654
when I could have
done something about it.

530
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:22,136
So tell your client
that I'm sorry.

531
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,533
It's... It's not right.

532
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:28,925
No, it's not.

533
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:30,536
I will sue them for a fortune,
and I'll win.

534
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:36,107
Piper will
never live to see it.

535
00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:41,938
You win.

536
00:23:41,982 --> 00:23:43,592
They're prepping the O.R.
for Meredith's surgery now.

537
00:23:44,985 --> 00:23:46,856
Ah. Thank God.

538
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,249
This isn't
a happy thing, Jonah.

539
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:49,903
Someone died
because of you.

540
00:23:49,946 --> 00:23:51,992
That's the only reason
the hospital's giving in.

541
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:53,472
Yeah, but if the hospital
had responded sooner,

542
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,821
that person
would still be alive.

543
00:23:54,864 --> 00:23:57,128
And I've been very clear
about how this works.

544
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:59,130
Lose the attitude.

545
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:01,610
You got what you want.

546
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:03,438
Turn the lights
back on.

547
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:09,749
There.

548
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:12,752
That should, uh, restore
the lights in, uh,

549
00:24:12,795 --> 00:24:15,146
both the intensive care
and O.R. suites, for now.

550
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:16,930
The rest of the hospital
is still dark.

551
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:18,758
But now, I-I need you
to take me to see my wife,

552
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:20,803
'cause I gotta be there
for the operation,

553
00:24:20,847 --> 00:24:23,284
make sure that you're actually
gonna follow through with it.

554
00:24:26,983 --> 00:24:28,594
Well, I guess
we'll be there with you.

555
00:24:36,993 --> 00:24:38,517
Hey.

556
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,867
Again, I'm so, so sor...
Sorry.

557
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,130
I know.

558
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:49,571
I-I need you
to do something for me.

559
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:51,225
Anything.

560
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:53,271
I need to
see the video.

561
00:24:53,314 --> 00:24:54,924
The barrel video?
Yeah.

562
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:56,665
You've seen it.

563
00:24:56,709 --> 00:24:58,798
Half the lawyers in this
building have seen it, and...

564
00:24:58,841 --> 00:25:01,017
And I haven't.

565
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:04,760
Lucy, it's...

566
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,806
it's incredibly
hard to watch.

567
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:08,590
I need to see it.

568
00:25:11,202 --> 00:25:12,855
Okay.

569
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:27,870
Should I stay, or...

570
00:25:27,914 --> 00:25:29,045
Mnh-mnh.

571
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:32,875
No. Um...

572
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:34,225
thank you.

573
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:27,495
Office Nolan will be with you
for every second

574
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,105
of this seven-hour
surgery.

575
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:31,760
You will not speak to
the surgery team, understood?

576
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:33,458
You make one move during
any of those seven hours,

577
00:26:33,501 --> 00:26:34,894
we remove you
from the O.R.

578
00:26:34,937 --> 00:26:36,200
and take you straight in
for processing.

579
00:26:36,243 --> 00:26:38,114
Wh...
Of course.

580
00:26:38,158 --> 00:26:39,507
I mean, look, this...

581
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:41,683
This surgery's gonna
save my wife's life.

582
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:44,208
Why... Why would I do
anything to disrupt it?

583
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:47,341
You do realize you're putting
those doctors under duress.

584
00:26:47,385 --> 00:26:49,256
The both of you,

585
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,519
you're essentially holding
this whole hospital hostage.

586
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:52,651
Don't listen to that,
sweetheart.

587
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,174
H-How you doing, baby?

588
00:26:54,218 --> 00:26:55,131
Just nervous.

589
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,664
Drop it! Stop!
Turn around!

590
00:27:07,318 --> 00:27:10,059
What were
you thinking?

591
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:14,238
If she dies,
my daughter doesn't.

592
00:27:17,676 --> 00:27:21,332
Here.
You got what you wanted.

593
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,725
Now bring the hospital
back online.

594
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:26,075
No.
Why not?

595
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:28,339
Well, 'cause that's
not how this works.

596
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:30,079
H-Hey, hey,
watch that.

597
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:32,734
Mr. Russell, you have a lot of
power right now.

598
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:34,910
Which is why, despite
my objections, you're here.

599
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,739
But let me make one thing
perfectly clear.

600
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,698
We have work to do.

601
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,266
Your strong-arm tactics
are helping no one.

602
00:27:48,097 --> 00:27:49,447
So, what's gonna happen
to that guy

603
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,318
that tried to
attack Meredith?

604
00:27:51,362 --> 00:27:55,061
He'll be charged with assault,
probably go to prison,

605
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:57,542
and his daughter will most
likely die while he's in there.

606
00:27:57,585 --> 00:27:59,152
Does that
make you happy?

607
00:27:59,195 --> 00:28:02,460
My wife is getting a second
chance that she really deserves.

608
00:28:02,503 --> 00:28:04,505
That's all I care about.

609
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:09,184
He has not looked up from
that thing in an hour.

610
00:28:09,228 --> 00:28:11,230
Oh, come on.
He's just having some fun.

611
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,188
I hope this is
not your attitude

612
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:15,625
when it comes to
our child's screen time.

613
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:17,453
What attitude?

614
00:28:17,497 --> 00:28:19,978
I'm just saying, there's nothing
with a little gaming.

615
00:28:20,021 --> 00:28:21,501
I like gaming.

616
00:28:21,544 --> 00:28:23,808
Yeah, you like
gaming a little too much.

617
00:28:25,461 --> 00:28:27,246
I don't feel good.

618
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,900
What's wrong?

619
00:28:31,903 --> 00:28:33,861
My head hurts.

620
00:28:35,863 --> 00:28:38,083
Let me see.

621
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:39,824
His pupils are
two different sizes.

622
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:41,521
That is a sign
of a serious head injury.

623
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:43,001
Can you go
get the doctor?

624
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:45,525
Hey, Rory,
w-what happened?

625
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:47,527
Did you hit your head?

626
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:50,704
I think so.
I don't remember.

627
00:28:50,747 --> 00:28:53,620
Rory!
Are you okay?

628
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:55,056
Oh, my baby.

629
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,579
Hi, Mom.
Hi.

630
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:58,451
My head really hurts.

631
00:28:58,494 --> 00:28:59,887
Oh.
Come on.

632
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:01,367
Let's get you home.
It's fine. Come on.

633
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,064
Uh, actually, sorry.

634
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,502
I-I know you don't know me, but
he has a serious head injury.

635
00:29:06,546 --> 00:29:07,895
That's okay.
Nothing an ice pack can't fix.

636
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:09,157
Right, buddy?

637
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:10,506
N-No, I don't...
I don't think...

638
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,899
Hold on.
Let me take a look at him.

639
00:29:15,947 --> 00:29:18,079
Your son is showing signs
of a concussion.

640
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:19,994
We're having some issues
with our equipment right now,

641
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:21,691
but it's important
Rory stay

642
00:29:21,735 --> 00:29:23,563
until we can run some tests on
him, make sure his head's okay.

643
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:24,694
No, we're taking him home.
Come on, baby.

644
00:29:24,738 --> 00:29:26,609
Sir, I really think... Rory is fine.

645
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:28,089
Kids play.
These things happen.

646
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:29,699
He just needs a little bit
of rest, is all.

647
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:31,005
Sir, you don't understand.

648
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:32,485
It's possible
there could be fluid

649
00:29:32,528 --> 00:29:33,921
putting pressure
on his brain.

650
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:35,792
He could go to sleep
and never wake up.

651
00:29:35,836 --> 00:29:37,142
Thank you, but we don't
need the kind of help

652
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:38,491
that you offer here.

653
00:29:38,534 --> 00:29:40,101
It's against
our beliefs.

654
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,973
I-I'm sorry, beliefs?
D-Did you not hear him?

655
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,583
H-He could
have a skull fracture.

656
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:45,890
Okay, we believe that
the only care Rory needs

657
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:47,369
is the healing power
of prayer.

658
00:29:47,413 --> 00:29:49,589
Listen, folks, maybe you should
just hear the doctor out.

659
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:51,460
I'm sorry, but why are
you two butting in?

660
00:29:51,504 --> 00:29:52,940
You're not
his parents.

661
00:29:52,984 --> 00:29:54,463
Okay, you... you have to
do something here.

662
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:55,682
I can't.
I don't have the authority.

663
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:57,771
But I do.

664
00:29:57,814 --> 00:30:00,687
I have probably cause to take
your son into protective custody,

665
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:04,082
according to Section 300 of the
Welfare and Institution Code.

666
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,953
Excuse me?
That's not happening.

667
00:30:05,997 --> 00:30:07,824
Yeah, it is, and if you try
to interfere,

668
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:11,002
I have the authority to put you
both under custody as well.

669
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:13,004
We're gonna go
call our lawyer.

670
00:30:13,047 --> 00:30:15,615
We'll be right out in the hall,
okay, Rory?

671
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:19,010
We'll be right back,
okay?

672
00:30:21,577 --> 00:30:23,101
Listen, just
hang here with the doc.

673
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:24,537
He'll take care of you,
okay?

674
00:30:25,886 --> 00:30:28,497
Hey, where... where is the
heart? When is it coming?

675
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,847
Not until your wife is fully
anesthetized and prepped.

676
00:30:32,632 --> 00:30:35,504
Y-You're doing great, honey.

677
00:30:35,548 --> 00:30:38,246
Don't worry, okay?
You're doing so well.

678
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,335
I love you so much.

679
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:42,511
I love you, too.

680
00:30:42,555 --> 00:30:44,774
Meredith, there's someone else
you should talk to

681
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:46,646
before your surgery.

682
00:30:46,689 --> 00:30:48,082
This is Piper.

683
00:30:48,126 --> 00:30:50,171
W-Wait.
Don't. Don't.

684
00:30:50,215 --> 00:30:51,912
It's her heart
you're taking.

685
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:53,958
D-Don't.
Stop that.

686
00:30:54,001 --> 00:30:55,698
Jonah.
Jonah, it's okay.

687
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,485
Listening to her
is the least I can do.

688
00:30:59,528 --> 00:31:02,705
Thank you. I've spent
the last 20 minutes

689
00:31:02,749 --> 00:31:04,838
trying to come up with
the right words to say.

690
00:31:04,881 --> 00:31:08,885
My dad thinks I can convince you
by telling you who I am.

691
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:12,019
As if where I want to
go to college

692
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:14,239
or what I want to
do with my life

693
00:31:14,282 --> 00:31:16,154
will somehow make you
give me that heart.

694
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:18,504
But he doesn't understand
how scared you are,

695
00:31:18,547 --> 00:31:21,028
how long you've been
living with that fear.

696
00:31:21,072 --> 00:31:22,682
From the moment they
told you there was

697
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:24,858
something wrong
with your heart,

698
00:31:24,901 --> 00:31:27,469
you've been terrified
of the day it will stop.

699
00:31:27,513 --> 00:31:32,170
My dad can't understand that
because he's not dying.

700
00:31:32,213 --> 00:31:33,867
Like we are.

701
00:31:35,825 --> 00:31:39,177
So even
though I'm not ready to go,

702
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,224
not ready to
leave my dad alone...

703
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:46,575
I forgive you
for what you're doing.

704
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:49,230
Don't... Don't...

705
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,753
Don't listen to her,
Mere.

706
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:53,017
Jonah,
I can't do this.

707
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,670
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

708
00:31:54,714 --> 00:31:56,107
Please stop.
Just stop.

709
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,065
W-What are you doing?
Don't... Don't stop.

710
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:00,198
The patient withdrew
her consent.

711
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:02,809
I don't
want to lose you.

712
00:32:02,852 --> 00:32:05,203
Please. Please.
I'm sorry.

713
00:32:05,246 --> 00:32:07,466
I'm proud of you,
Piper.

714
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,207
We'll see you here in
a little while, okay?

715
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:15,735
It's over, Jonah.

716
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:17,084
Turn off
the ransomware.

717
00:32:17,128 --> 00:32:18,999
No one else
needs to die today.

718
00:32:21,784 --> 00:32:23,308
Jonah.

719
00:32:24,961 --> 00:32:26,050
It's over.

720
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:44,677
I'm...
I-I can't get in.

721
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,506
They...
They locked me out.

722
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:49,508
Who did?

723
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,336
My partners.

724
00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:52,815
I thought they were
trying to help me

725
00:32:52,859 --> 00:32:54,774
out of the goodness
of their heart.

726
00:32:56,645 --> 00:33:00,127
But they just used me.

727
00:33:00,171 --> 00:33:01,302
To get paid.

728
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:12,767
You think I crossed a line
taking custody of Rory.

729
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,943
Police should not
be empowered

730
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:16,379
to take a child
from their parents

731
00:33:16,423 --> 00:33:18,120
without any kind
of due process.

732
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:19,513
Did you not just see
the mountain of paperwork

733
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:20,993
I just filled out?

734
00:33:21,036 --> 00:33:23,082
Indigenous children,
Black and brown children,

735
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,649
the law has a history
of separating families.

736
00:33:25,693 --> 00:33:27,216
But this was an emergency.

737
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,132
I mean, I-I feared for
the safety of this child,

738
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,874
and I will not apologize
for protecting him.

739
00:33:32,918 --> 00:33:35,485
I know. I know why
you did what you did.

740
00:33:35,529 --> 00:33:38,401
But cops have always found
a way to justify their actions,

741
00:33:38,445 --> 00:33:40,229
whether warranted
or not.

742
00:33:42,318 --> 00:33:44,103
Hello?

743
00:33:44,146 --> 00:33:45,278
Harper, you still
with the kid?

744
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:47,019
Yeah, we're waiting
for his doctor.

745
00:33:47,062 --> 00:33:50,065
Listen, I sent your JCR
paperwork to Systems.

746
00:33:50,109 --> 00:33:53,677
It came back having no record
of a Griffin and Gabby Kane

747
00:33:53,721 --> 00:33:56,289
ever having a child at
a hospital or via adoption.

748
00:33:56,332 --> 00:33:57,986
What?

749
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,945
Not only that,
there's no birth certificate

750
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:03,513
or social security number
on file for a Rory Kane.

751
00:34:03,557 --> 00:34:04,819
Those people
aren't his parents.

752
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:09,693
Lisa, the boy's parents,
the Kanes,

753
00:34:09,737 --> 00:34:10,956
a-are they still
in the waiting area?

754
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:12,653
Uh, no, they left about
20 minutes ago.

755
00:34:14,742 --> 00:34:16,352
But you can't do this.

756
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:18,050
I mean, my wife needs me.
I've got to take care of her.

757
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:19,486
It's too late
for that.

758
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:21,009
You're headed to jail
on a murder charge.

759
00:34:21,053 --> 00:34:22,097
If the hospital
can't pay the ransom

760
00:34:22,141 --> 00:34:23,403
and get the power
turned back on,

761
00:34:23,446 --> 00:34:24,926
that means Piper
can't get her heart,

762
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,188
and that'll
be two deaths on you.

763
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:27,581
Unless you tell us
who you're working with

764
00:34:27,624 --> 00:34:29,278
so we can end this
in time to save her.

765
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:32,064
Look, Meredith still has some
time left to live.

766
00:34:32,107 --> 00:34:34,718
If you cooperate,
it is possible

767
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:37,199
you could get out on bail
and spend that time with her.

768
00:34:41,073 --> 00:34:43,553
Alright, Spencer Murkle
and Chloe Speeker.

769
00:34:43,597 --> 00:34:45,468
I met them both online.

770
00:34:45,512 --> 00:34:47,818
They were offering some money for
me to be able to build some ransomware.

771
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:48,994
I-I've got
all this medical debt.

772
00:34:49,037 --> 00:34:51,692
So I said yes,

773
00:34:51,735 --> 00:34:54,608
but they were the ones who
suggested hacking the hospital.

774
00:34:54,651 --> 00:34:57,089
And I-I thought it was actually
gonna help Meredith and I,

775
00:34:57,132 --> 00:34:59,787
but clearly, we were
just a means to an end.

776
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,745
And where can we
find them?

777
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:04,966
I don't know, but, uh, I mean,
your tech team

778
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:07,186
could probably trace
those messages.

779
00:35:12,713 --> 00:35:13,888
7-Adam-100 to units
in the rear.

780
00:35:13,931 --> 00:35:15,411
Is the C-Side set?

781
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:16,673
C-Side is set.

782
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:18,893
Roger.
Making contact.

783
00:35:26,118 --> 00:35:27,771
Police!
We have a warrant!

784
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:29,251
Open the door now!

785
00:35:35,127 --> 00:35:36,606
Clear.

786
00:35:39,218 --> 00:35:40,741
Clear.

787
00:35:43,178 --> 00:35:44,658
This place is deserted.

788
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:46,486
Looks like no one's
been in here in months.

789
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:47,748
Our trace
must have been off.

790
00:35:47,791 --> 00:35:49,402
There's no
computer equipment here.

791
00:35:49,445 --> 00:35:51,056
You can't run that kind
of cyber attack from a laptop.

792
00:36:40,192 --> 00:36:42,281
Hi. Keep your hands
where we can see them.

793
00:36:42,324 --> 00:36:44,152
What's this about?

794
00:36:44,196 --> 00:36:45,458
It's about which one of you
wants to disable

795
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:47,155
the ransomware
and make a deal,

796
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:49,810
and which one of you is gonna
spend a couple decades in prison.

797
00:36:51,768 --> 00:36:54,031
That's a good answer.

798
00:37:01,082 --> 00:37:03,519
Hey!
Show me your hands.

799
00:37:06,043 --> 00:37:08,307
We were coming back to
the hospital to get Rory.

800
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,178
Sure you were.

801
00:37:10,222 --> 00:37:12,963
Put your hands over your head,
interlace your fingers.

802
00:37:13,007 --> 00:37:14,835
You're under arrest
for kidnapping.

803
00:37:17,446 --> 00:37:19,013
We gave Rory
a good home.

804
00:37:19,056 --> 00:37:20,493
Gabby,
don't say anything.

805
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,688
She's been in there forever.
Yeah.

806
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:34,561
I tried knocking,
but she didn't answer.

807
00:37:35,404 --> 00:37:37,058
We should check on her.

808
00:37:38,476 --> 00:37:40,478
Lucy?
It's Chris and Tamara.

809
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:41,784
We're coming in.

810
00:37:47,877 --> 00:37:50,663
Lucy, are you okay?

811
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:53,187
Oh. Sorry.

812
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,668
I-I've been processing
a few things.

813
00:37:55,711 --> 00:37:58,932
You watched it?

814
00:37:58,975 --> 00:38:01,151
Yeah.

815
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,153
Every minute.

816
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,590
Maybe we should
go home.

817
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:06,200
Yeah.

818
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:09,725
Um, I've decided
not to testify.

819
00:38:09,769 --> 00:38:11,814
I completely understand.

820
00:38:11,858 --> 00:38:13,903
I've been trying to prove
how strong I am,

821
00:38:13,947 --> 00:38:17,907
but... I survived that.

822
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:19,692
I don't have
anything to prove.

823
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,390
Yeah.

824
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:24,653
We have
plenty of evidence.

825
00:38:24,697 --> 00:38:26,220
We'll convict her without you,
I promise.

826
00:38:26,263 --> 00:38:28,483
Let's go.
I'm making you dinner.

827
00:38:28,526 --> 00:38:30,920
Okay.
Is it another ClipTalk recipe?

828
00:38:30,964 --> 00:38:32,139
No.

829
00:38:32,182 --> 00:38:33,531
ClipTalk has recipes?

830
00:38:33,575 --> 00:38:35,142
No, it has gimmicks.

831
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:37,448
And yet,
you cleaned the plate.

832
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:38,536
Dude.

833
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,537
Sorry.

834
00:38:41,104 --> 00:38:43,498
Hey.
Uh, headed out?

835
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,152
I am.

836
00:38:45,195 --> 00:38:46,675
Me, too.

837
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:48,634
You know, Tamara was
just talking about

838
00:38:48,677 --> 00:38:50,766
how she really wanted to try
one of the restaurants

839
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,159
in the neighborhood.

840
00:38:52,202 --> 00:38:53,856
Is... Is there a place
you recommend?

841
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,989
Uh, there's this great vegan
joint around the corner.

842
00:38:56,032 --> 00:38:57,730
Uh. The Great Gaia.

843
00:38:57,773 --> 00:38:59,601
Earth-friendly,
cruelty-free.

844
00:38:59,645 --> 00:39:01,777
I could show you the way.

845
00:39:01,821 --> 00:39:03,387
You okay?

846
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:05,781
G... Yeah. Go.

847
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,697
I'll make her dinner.

848
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:10,220
Let's go.

849
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,222
I just gotta
get my stuff.

850
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:16,531
You cook?

851
00:39:16,574 --> 00:39:18,054
God, no.

852
00:39:18,098 --> 00:39:20,013
Eat out,
or order in?

853
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:21,536
Depends.

854
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:24,017
Are you gonna rub my feet
if we order in?

855
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,540
I'll rub them
at the restaurant.

856
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:28,021
I don't care.
What? That is gross.

857
00:39:28,064 --> 00:39:29,849
They're your feet.

858
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:32,460
Do I really have to explain
to you when it is appropriate

859
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,375
to take off your shoes
in a public place

860
00:39:34,418 --> 00:39:38,161
when it is not
the beach or the park?

861
00:39:38,205 --> 00:39:40,555
So you're saying
never on an airplane?

862
00:39:40,598 --> 00:39:42,557
Oh, now I know you're
just messing with me.

863
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,124
What?

864
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:49,172
I just wanna go home.

865
00:39:51,044 --> 00:39:54,003
Uh, yeah, I'm afraid
that can't happen.

866
00:39:54,047 --> 00:39:56,310
My mom and dad
can explain.

867
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:59,530
Um...

868
00:39:59,574 --> 00:40:03,273
I'm so sorry, but...

869
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,450
they are
not your real parents.

870
00:40:06,494 --> 00:40:13,457
Um, you were kidnapped
when you were three years old.

871
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:15,416
I know... I know this must be
hard for you to hear,

872
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:18,767
but your real name is...
Is Scott Reynolds.

873
00:40:18,811 --> 00:40:20,900
Your parents are
Gerald and Dorothy.

874
00:40:20,943 --> 00:40:23,816
They, um...
They're on their way here now.

875
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:28,516
They sent me
a picture to show you.

876
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:31,780
So, that is Gerald,
and that is Dorothy,

877
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:34,435
and that little, handsome guy
right there is you.

878
00:40:34,478 --> 00:40:38,613
What if I don't
want to go with them?

879
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,397
I don't even know them.

880
00:40:40,441 --> 00:40:44,793
Listen, I-I know this all must
be moving very fast for you,

881
00:40:44,837 --> 00:40:49,363
but...
until they get here,

882
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:52,714
I will sit here
and wait with you.

883
00:40:52,758 --> 00:40:54,977
We both will.

884
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:57,153
And while we do, um,

885
00:40:57,197 --> 00:40:59,460
can you show me that
game you were playing?

886
00:40:59,503 --> 00:41:02,376
'Cause I think
my boys will dig it.

887
00:41:02,419 --> 00:41:03,594
Sure.

888
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:17,870
Well, the doctor is very happy
with how the surgery went.

889
00:41:17,913 --> 00:41:19,872
The next 48 hours
will be critical,

890
00:41:19,915 --> 00:41:23,658
but she thinks that Piper has an
excellent chance at a long life.

891
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:25,486
And her dad?

892
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:27,488
Oh, I don't the D.A.'s office
is gonna press charges.

893
00:41:27,531 --> 00:41:29,490
Even if they did,
there's no jury in the world

894
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:31,405
would convict him.

895
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:32,754
What about Meredith?

896
00:41:32,798 --> 00:41:34,712
She is on her way
to hospice care.

897
00:41:34,756 --> 00:41:39,326
Sadly, she does
not have much time left.

898
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:43,199
Well, I have heard on hard days,
the only prescription

899
00:41:43,243 --> 00:41:45,723
is a hot bath
and a cold glass of wine.

900
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:47,203
Really?

901
00:41:47,247 --> 00:41:49,031
I've never been much of
a bath guy.

902
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:50,728
Even if you
take it with me?

903
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:53,862
Oh, that is an entirely
different kind of prescription.

904
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:56,386
Mm.

905
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,127
As soon as you
take a shower.

906
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:01,565
I will have you know,
this smell was hard-earned

907
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:05,352
by transporting 27 patients out
of and back into this hospital.

908
00:42:05,395 --> 00:42:08,311
Yeah, no, and I will be happy to
reward all that hard work

909
00:42:08,355 --> 00:42:09,878
with some quality
naked time,

910
00:42:09,922 --> 00:42:12,881
just as soon as you
scrub those pits.
