Bailey's sitting in a jail cell
right now because of you.

1035
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,328
She is?

1036
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:47,722
Oh, God.
That's, uh, horrible.

1037
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:49,681
No.

1038
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:51,944
It's exactly
what you wanted.

1039
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:54,816
Well, of course
it isn't.

1040
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,558
But, you know,
I got to say,

1041
00:41:57,602 --> 00:41:59,952
hearing that she's finally
facing some consequences

1042
00:41:59,995 --> 00:42:01,736
for her actions, well...

1043
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:06,219
...it does well
for my spirit.

You really can't
let her be happy, can you?

1046
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,881
Couldn't stand that she
didn't need you anymore.

1047
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:18,492
Well...

1048
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,799
Well, your time is over.

1049
00:42:20,842 --> 00:42:23,062
I know who you are now.
