00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:09,641
So...how was
horseback riding?

1050
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:11,556
Beautiful.

1051
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,907
Wade said that you
helped him find it.

1052
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,691
Nolan:
Something like that.

1053
00:41:16,735 --> 00:41:17,866
But you guys didn't
come all this way

1054
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,912
just to thank me
for that.

1055
00:41:21,261 --> 00:41:23,481
No.

1056
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:26,266
I just received
a formal request

1057
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:28,398
to temporarily assign you
to another station.

1058
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:30,139
My first day
in the hole.

1059
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:31,358
Cool.

1060
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:34,753
Not cool?

1061
00:41:34,796 --> 00:41:37,582
No. This request
is for the whole week.

1062
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:39,235
That means I'll miss
my T.O. exam.

1063
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:40,715
Exactly.

1064
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:43,457
And before you start
plotting how to sneak back

1065
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,894
and take it on your lunch hour,
the station you're going to

1066
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:47,679
is four hours away,
on the border.

1067
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:50,029
This is my punishment

1068
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,509
for pissing off
the Union President.

1069
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:53,162
He knows I want
to be a T.O.

1070
00:41:53,206 --> 00:41:54,947
Yeah.

1071
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,732
Isn't there anything
you can do?

1072
00:41:57,776 --> 00:42:00,387
I would if I could,
but my hands are tied.

1073
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:04,086
If you try to
reject the assignment,

1074
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:07,612
they will consider it
disobeying a direct order.

1075
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:10,397
So even if you pass the test,
they wouldn't make you a T.O.

1076
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,355
if you're facing
disciplinary action.

1077
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:17,012
Well, then you are just gonna
have to take the next test.

1078
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:18,448
When is it?

1079
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:20,581
In two years.
