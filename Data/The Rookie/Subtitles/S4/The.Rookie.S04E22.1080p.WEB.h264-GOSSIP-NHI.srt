00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:00,811
Her cactus is growing weird.

181
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:01,769
Weird, you say?

182
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,248
Wrong angle.

183
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:05,468
We'll get right on that.
Please do.

184
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:14,434
Ooh, this is exciting.

185
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:17,132
Phone only rings about
twice a week here.

186
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:19,917
Frontera Police Department.

187
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:23,573
We'll be right there.

188
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,532
Trouble?

189
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:26,837
Bar fight.

190
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,578
Well, big cities
and small towns...

191
00:07:28,622 --> 00:07:30,188
you can always count on someone
to be drunk by 9:00 a.m.

192
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:31,668
Your first hour on the job,

193
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,670
and you're already getting
all the exciting stuff.

194
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:34,889
You must be good luck.

195
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:36,020
Or bad.

196
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:39,502
Maybe you were separated
at birth.

197
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:43,637
He's a year older than me.
And he was born in Florida.

198
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,770
Plus, ah, he really doesn't
look that much like me.

199
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,685
Mm. The hell he doesn't.

200
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,470
Not the brightest
bulb, though.

201
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,646
Oh. Oh, my God.

202
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:56,606
It's... It's Tim...

203
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,825
and Dim.

204
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:04,309
Okay. Come on.
Let's get this over with.

205
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:05,963
That's good.

206
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:11,621
Yo, this is blowing my mind!

207
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:14,537
It's like we're looking in
a fun-house mirror of handsome.

208
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:17,540
Sit down, Dim... Jake.

209
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,541
You need to focus.

210
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,021
Okay.

211
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:23,415
Have we met before?

212
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:24,808
No.

213
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,288
That, I'd remember.

214
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,985
Oh, you would.

215
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,208
We found your car.

216
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:35,384
Dude, you found it?

217
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:37,952
Yo, thank you,
thank you, man.

218
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:40,171
I mean, some asshat
stole it from me last week.

219
00:08:40,215 --> 00:08:42,739
Your car wasn't stolen...
it was towed.

220
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,132
You parked in front
of a hydrant.

221
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:45,525
Oops.

222
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:46,656
My bad.

223
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,657
So, where's the car now?

224
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,267
In evidence.

225
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:51,748
We found four kilos of black tar
heroin inside of it.

226
00:08:51,792 --> 00:08:55,099
What? Yo, that's crazy.

227
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:57,188
I mean
it ain't mine.

228
00:08:57,232 --> 00:08:59,190
Your fingerprints are
all over the bags.

229
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:01,105
Which means this is decision
time for you, Jake.

230
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:03,107
You help us,
we help you.

231
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:04,369
Otherwise, it's
back to prison.

232
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:07,198
Bruh, I thought that
we had a bond.

233
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:08,635
Where are the drugs from?

234
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:13,944
Mexico.

235
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,772
I was hired to drive them
across the border,

236
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:19,210
but, you know, I hit up
my girl's place when I got back

237
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:20,864
in town... you know
what I'm saying?

238
00:09:20,908 --> 00:09:22,823
Anyway, I went back out,
the car wasn't there.

239
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,564
I've been freaking out
ever since.

240
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:25,869
Alright. Who are you supposed
to deliver the drugs to?

241
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:27,697
Roy Hajek.

242
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:30,613
Got the job through
a slinger we both know.

243
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:33,747
Have you ever met Hajek
or any of his crew?

244
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,357
No. Why?

245
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,189
You know,
they've never met.

246
00:09:41,232 --> 00:09:43,452
So Tim could
go undercover as Dim,

247
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:45,715
and... and... and we would
arrest a major trafficker.

248
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,543
Forget it.
What?

249
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,763
Come on, you totally pulled
off playing the hitman.

250
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,329
I agree.

251
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:52,896
It's too good of
an opportunity to pass up.

252
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,768
You just want to see me
pretend to be Dim.

253
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:55,769
Duh.
Fine.

254
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:56,770
I'll do it.

255
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,249
Yes! Oh, okay, okay.

256
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,687
So, uh, we got
to dirty you up, and then...

257
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,514
and then we have to
slick back your hair, 'cause,

258
00:10:02,558 --> 00:10:03,864
you know, that guy was,
like, kind of greasy.

259
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:05,822
You are enjoying this
way too much.

260
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:11,045
Ooh! And tattoos...
we got to get tattoos.

261
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:16,354
When we get to the bar,
don't park right out front.

262
00:10:16,398 --> 00:10:17,965
Oh, but it's just
the Benedict brothers.

263
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,531
They fight
every other day.

264
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:22,143
Doesn't matter.
Always do things the right way.

265
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,884
That way,
when the danger is real,

266
00:10:23,927 --> 00:10:25,320
the moves are automatic.

267
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:27,452
Got it.

268
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,331
♪♪

269
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:37,375
You got this?

270
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:38,420
Yes, sir.

271
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,988
Doug, Will, come on,
knock it off.

272
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,165
I said
knock it off... now!

273
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,689
Doug!

274
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,734
Okay, okay, okay.

275
00:10:47,777 --> 00:10:49,649
Doug, are you okay?

276
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:51,259
Yeah.

277
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,478
Uh, but my neck kinda hurts.

278
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:55,393
No, no,
don't touch that.

279
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:56,177
Ugh.

280
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,357
I'm so sorry, man.
Oh, please don't die.

281
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,532
Hey, you know what?

282
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:04,489
Shouldn't we just pull
this thing out?

283
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:05,490
No, don't touch it.

284
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:06,709
Thank you for coming.

285
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:08,493
Nearest hospital is
an hour away.

286
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:09,799
Of course.

287
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:13,324
Good morning.
Two margaritas, if you are able.

288
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:15,109
What?
We're on vacation.

289
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:16,893
Yeah, you want anything?
No.

290
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:18,590
I'm gonna need some tape
to secure the glass

291
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:19,722
so we can take him
to the hospital.

292
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:20,984
I've got some
in the shop.

293
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:21,942
But you don't
have to take him.

294
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:23,508
Yes, I do.
He's my patient now.

295
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:24,771
I got you, dude.

296
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:26,163
How much have
you had to drink?

297
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,122
Not a drop.
We just got here.

298
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,558
Okay. You're gonna
take your brother and Bailey

299
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:30,994
to the hospital.

300
00:11:31,038 --> 00:11:32,387
And then you're gonna pay
Walt for all the damages

301
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,780
you've done here.
Yes, ma'am.

302
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:36,608
Okay. Come on.
Got you.

303
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,568
Cheers.

304
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:44,138
Mm.

305
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:45,879
This is a dump.

306
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:52,668
Uh, Bailey made it
to the hospital.

307
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,974
Doug is in surgery.

308
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,802
Thank God.

309
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:57,847
Those two are
idiots, but...

310
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:00,067
they're not bad guys.

311
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,376
Tourists.
They never plan for the heat.

312
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:10,686
Pete?

313
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,992
Whoa!

314
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,428
It's gonna blow!

315
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,039
Pete, get back here.
It's just overheating.

316
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,519
Save yourself!

317
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,304
God.

318
00:12:20,348 --> 00:12:21,610
Hey.

319
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,786
John? Oh, my gosh,
the answer to my prayers.

320
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,354
Um...the car
broke down.

321
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:28,486
Yeah. I can see that.

322
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,140
He's still running.

323
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,708
Pete! Stop! Come back!

324
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,318
Is it safe?!

325
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:35,493
Yes! I promise!

326
00:12:35,537 --> 00:12:37,060
Really?!
Yeah, you're safe!

327
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:39,410
You sure?!

328
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:41,325
I told him this
was gonna happen,

329
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,850
but he isn't happy unless
the AC is blasting at 60.

330
00:12:43,893 --> 00:12:46,113
Ah.
Yeah.

331
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:49,203
Hi. I'm Chastity.

332
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:51,466
Sorry. Where are my manners?
This is Officer Navar.

333
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,772
Officer Navar,
this is Chastity.

334
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,469
She's dating
my brother Pete.

335
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,123
Half-brother.

336
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,037
Right,
my half-brother Pete.

337
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,429
Whew!

338
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:00,127
I see this all the time.

339
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,737
I got some coolant in the back,
should get you going shortly.

340
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,999
Thank you.

341
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,827
Why do people run, dude?
It sucks.

342
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,307
What are you doing here?

343
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,135
What do you mean?
You invited me.

344
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:09,614
I absolutely did not.

345
00:13:09,658 --> 00:13:11,399
Well, it was
certainly implied.

346
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:13,270
I mean, why do you think
I got this Airstream, dude?

347
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,706
It's so we didn't have
to pay for a room.

348
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,925
I didn't even know you
owned an Airstream.

349
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:17,448
I don't.

350
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:18,972
Oh, my...
I feel like I'm gonna die.

351
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,495
Did you bring
my inhaler?

352
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:21,844
Yeah, of course I did.
Do you need it right now?

353
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:22,540
Yeah, I do.
You need it right now.

354
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,151
I do.

You didn't do
a proper threat assessment,

463
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,007

in the line of fire.

464

Mine and his.

465

it's just about training.

any outstanding
warrants.

474
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:09,991
I can't.
It's past 7:00.

475
00:20:10,034 --> 00:20:12,646
The station only allows
us access to the CJIS database

476

477
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,215

I was afraid for my life.

481
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,962
Yeah. You also told me
your name was John Smith.

482
00:20:25,006 --> 00:20:26,442
So save it for the judge.

483
00:20:26,486 --> 00:20:27,704

first shift?

484
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:30,707
No. You've got friends here.
I can handle it.

485

for the screw-up.

486
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:34,015
Alright.
Call me if you need anything.

487
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,930
And don't let him out of there
for any reason.

488
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,845

489
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,673

girlfriend picked up.

00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:48,203
Wait.
Why are you being weird?

493

It's easier to show you.

494
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:58,300
Oh, um...

495
00:20:58,344 --> 00:20:59,649
That is disturbing.

00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,738

Yeah... Juicy.

498
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,614
No.
Mm-hmm.

499
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:09,485
It's Juicy.

500
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:11,574
