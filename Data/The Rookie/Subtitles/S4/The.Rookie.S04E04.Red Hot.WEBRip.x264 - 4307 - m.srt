1
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:09,403
This is amazing.

2
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:10,983
Where did you learn to
cook like this?

3
00:00:11,068 --> 00:00:13,085
Let me guess... you're also
a Michelin-star chef.

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,125
I wish.

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,193
We rotate kitchen duty
at the firehouse.

6
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:17,672
Gets pretty competitive.

7
00:00:17,756 --> 00:00:19,022
Well, it must be nice
to have a job

8
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,762
that gives you
so much free time like that.

9
00:00:20,846 --> 00:00:22,025
Meow.

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,244
You know, this
cop-versus-firefighter thing

11
00:00:24,328 --> 00:00:25,344
is getting old.

12
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:27,160
We need to settle this
once and for all.

13
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:28,436
Arm wrestling.

14
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:30,109
Pittsburgh Steelers
trivia contest.

15
00:00:30,194 --> 00:00:31,860
War story showdown.

16
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:34,298
Whoever tells the best story
tonight at dinner wins.

17
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:35,772
Oh, I've so got this.

18
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:40,433
I once ran into a fire,
carried out a woman in labor,

19
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:41,827
delivered the baby,

20
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:44,831
and then went back in
to rescue one of my crew.

21
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,413
And that's
my fourth-best story.

22
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,577
Okay, m-maybe
I don't got this.

23
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,578
Oh, you know what?

24
00:00:50,663 --> 00:00:51,792
I gotta get out of here.

25
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:54,448
- It's Lopez's first day back from maternity leave...
- Mm.

26
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:56,581
And I'm supposed to pick up
some champagne from all of us.

27
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:58,312
Champagne
for a nursing mom?

28
00:00:58,397 --> 00:01:00,007
<i>♪ I should have gone

29
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,085
I said flowers.

30
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,007
You heard champagne?
That's so weird.

31
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:05,285

32
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,895

Oh, and this one's
my favorite.

34
00:01:08,592 --> 00:01:11,499
How does so much snot come out
of such a little nose?

35
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:12,992
Lopez.

36
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:13,902
Sergeant Caradine.

37
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:14,991
Great to see you.

38
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,672
I was just sharing
a few pictures.

39
00:01:16,757 --> 00:01:17,819
Cute kid.

40
00:01:17,903 --> 00:01:19,719
We got a backlog
of open cases.

41
00:01:19,804 --> 00:01:20,749
Can't wait to
get started.

42
00:01:20,834 --> 00:01:23,265
Great. I'm assigning you
23 through 60.

43
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:25,088
That's 37 cases.

44
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,394
Don't worry. At least
four of them are non-workers.

45
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:29,396
And by the way, we cleared out
a maintenance closet

46
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,501
for your, uh,
you know...

47
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:31,586
Pumping?

48
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:33,835
Thanks. I'll use
the women's locker room.

49
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:35,054
Suit yourself.

50
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:37,171
Was there something else
you wanted to say?

51
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:38,536
"Get to work"?

52
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,625
I was looking for
"Welcome back."

53
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:41,669
That too.

60
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:55,671
next month, we'll be voting
for our new union rep.

61
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:59,374
Per the MOA, all candidates
are given the opportunity

62
00:01:59,491 --> 00:02:00,645
to address the troops.

63
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:01,843
So,

64
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:03,851
please help me welcome

65
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:07,101
your first, your last,
your only candidate,

66
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,851
Smitty.

67
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,679
Thank you, Sarge.

68
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,827
Look, I don't want to bore you
with a long speech.

69
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:20,918
I've been union rep
since 2006.

70
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:22,493
You know me.

71
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:24,234
You love me.

72
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,647
Vote Smitty!

73
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:28,487
I'm not really
taking questions.

74
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:29,931
Just a-a quick one
about the next round

75
00:02:30,015 --> 00:02:31,257
of union negotiations...

76
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:34,312
W-What do you think about
pushing for a change to the MOA

77
00:02:34,397 --> 00:02:36,619
where county mental health
is dispatched alongside us

78
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:38,687
for all calls involving
mental illness?

79
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:41,927
Great question.

80
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:45,288
And I assure you
that I have your back.

81
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:47,448
Have a button.

82
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,174
- Color me inspired.
- Totally.

83
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:52,702
Alright, that's it.

84
00:02:52,787 --> 00:02:54,705
Let's get to it.
Be safe out there.

85
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:56,141
You ready to roll,
Go-fer?

86
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:56,851
Yes, sir.

87
00:02:56,936 --> 00:02:59,812
What would you like this
"Go-fer" to go for first?

88
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,265
A tainted coffee?

89
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,051
A moldy donut?

90
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:04,975
I'm sensing a lack of
fear of my authority.

91
00:03:05,091 --> 00:03:06,787
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm.

92
00:03:06,872 --> 00:03:08,090
So, Bradford.

93
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:11,456
So, I'm gonna need you to catch
any 100 calls

94
00:03:11,626 --> 00:03:13,109
that come in
for the next hour or so.

95
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,719
I'm gonna pay
Elijah Stone a visit.

96
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,968
You need back-up?

97
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:17,859
No, I can handle delivering
a simple message.

98
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:18,640
Let me guess...

99
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,149
"Hire another sniper
to shoot up our streets,

100
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,378
and we'll drop
a Bearcat on you"?

101
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,206
Well, I was thinking about
promising something

102
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,381
a little more...
Boring?

103
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:25,947
Legal.

104
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,166
Alright, you do you,

105
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,559
but we'll roll in heavy
if you need us.

106
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:29,429
I have no doubt.

107
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,555
Spot check.

108
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,241
Let's see
your evidence kit.

109
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:34,116
Just a second.

110
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:37,068
And... here.

111
00:03:38,964 --> 00:03:42,656
Alright, we got fingerprint cards,
brush, powder.

112
00:03:42,741 --> 00:03:44,096
What is this?

113
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,335
That's my snack.

114
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:46,898
You said that we should
carry one on hand

115
00:03:46,982 --> 00:03:49,272
just in case we get stuck
at the scene or miss lunch.

116
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:51,189
Oh, and soybeans
are high in protein,

117
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:52,452
- and they're low in f...
- They are also

118
00:03:52,536 --> 00:03:54,679
a mold-fest in waiting.

119
00:03:54,995 --> 00:03:56,866
You have no idea how long
this is gonna live

120
00:03:56,951 --> 00:03:58,217
in your kit
before you need it,

121
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:01,113
so pack something
with preservatives.

122
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:01,788
Right.

123
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:03,483
If it can be used
as compost,

124
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,835
it's not a snack.

125
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:07,640
Get your gear squared away
and meet me at the shop.

126
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:09,379
Yes, ma'am.

127
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:13,168
Nothing like
starting your morning off

128
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,692
being made to feel like
an idiot.

129
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,607
I can handle it.

130
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,669
I mean, yeah,
Harper is tough, but fair.

131
00:04:19,754 --> 00:04:21,903
It's an honor to train
under someone like her.

132
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:23,333
Okay.

133
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:26,659
Well, hey, that is a perfect
answer for anyone else,

134
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:28,192
but you can be
honest with me.

135
00:04:28,277 --> 00:04:30,011
Rookies talk crap about
their T.O.s all the time.

136
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:31,095
It's expected.

137
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,321
With all due respect,
you're not a rookie.

138
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:37,848
I'm the only probationary
employee at the station.

139
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:39,356
Fair enough.

140
00:04:39,441 --> 00:04:42,806
But, hey, listen, if you ever
want to talk, let me know,

141
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,940
and I'd be happy to dust off
my P1 cone of silence.

142
00:04:46,024 --> 00:04:47,594
Thanks, but, really

143
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:49,356
it's going great.

144
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,441
Okay.

it does not look good.

161
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,761
Well, the ballistics didn't
match the rifle in his house,

162
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:26,528
and no one can ID him
at the scene.

163
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:28,967
I mean, that sounds like
reasonable doubt to me.

164
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:30,794
He threatened police
with a live grenade.

165
00:05:30,902 --> 00:05:32,271
He had a dozen more
in his bedroom.

166
00:05:32,356 --> 00:05:33,423
He's doing jail time.

167
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:36,252
Then I need you to get him
released on bail.

168
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,934
So you can help him
disappear.

169
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,516
Never mind.
It's better if I don't know.

170
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
Eh, you see? Now you're
getting the hang of this.

171
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:48,567
Can I go out the back? Yeah.

172
00:05:52,933 --> 00:05:55,199

What can I do for you?

173
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:57,594
The kitchen's closed,
but I'm sure we could, uh,

174
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,513
you know, whip you up
a little somethin'-somethin'.

175
00:05:59,597 --> 00:06:01,559
Nah,
I didn't come to eat.

176
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:03,278
So I figured since
you were determined

177
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,846
to step out the shadows,
I should be there to greet you.

178
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,098
I don't know
what you mean.

179
00:06:07,183 --> 00:06:08,893
Yeah, you do.
We got a shooter sitting

180
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:10,634
in the holding cell
waiting to be transferred

181
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:11,973
to the Twin Towers.

182
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,169
And I know
he belongs to you.

183
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,904
I just can't prove it...
Yet.

184
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,259
So you should consider
a different path

185
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:20,522
while you still can,

186
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:21,762
'cause the one
you're walking

187
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:24,403
puts you on
a collision course with me.

188
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:36,935
<i>None of what
just happened here is okay.</i>

189
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,478
No, no, no.
I know what I saw.

190
00:06:38,563 --> 00:06:40,266
She was trying to
get away from you.

191
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:41,272
You don't know
what you're talking about.

192
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:42,535
What's the problem?

193
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,972
I-I saw a woman come running
out of his house.

194
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:46,757
He and this other guy
were trying to get her,

195
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:48,454
- but she got away.
- It is nothing, Officer.

196
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:50,914
That "other guy" is
our home health aide, Carson.

197
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:52,463
My wife is bipolar.

198
00:06:52,548 --> 00:06:53,640
She's having
a paranoid episode.

199
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:54,711
We're trying to
help her.

200
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:56,148
That is not
what it looked like.

201
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:57,245
You need to mind
your own business.

202
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,203
Sir, what's your name?

203
00:06:58,287 --> 00:06:59,313
Daniel Charles.

204
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:01,510
My wife is Linda.
This is all getting out of hand.

205
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,945
My wife needs her meds,
not the police.

206
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,281
So you can leave.

207
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:07,038
Actually, I can't.
Which way did she go?

208
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:08,617
She ran through
the neighbor's yard.

209
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:11,389
Control, I need units
circulating on the lookout

210
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,747
for a missing and endangered
female named Linda Charles.

211
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:15,078
Last seen wearing...

212
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:18,766
Gray sweatshirt,
white pants.

213
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:20,477
Thank you.
Gray sweatshirt, white pants.

214
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:22,610
Last seen northbound
on Glen Grove.

215
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:23,960
Officer, please.

216
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,289
Carson and I
should handle this.

217
00:07:25,374 --> 00:07:27,188
My wife is not well.
You're going to scare her...

218
00:07:27,272 --> 00:07:28,451
Make things
ten times worse.

219
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:29,974
Sorry, sir.
That's no longer an option.

220
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:31,814
I'm gonna need to see some ID
from you and your aide,

221
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:33,381
and then I'm gonna go
find your wife.

222
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:39,156
What about nuts?

223
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:40,634
What about them?

224
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:42,023
For a snack in my kit.

225
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:43,635
I mean, they're healthy,
and they don't go bad.

226
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:45,420
Just buy
a damn candy bar.

227
00:07:45,505 --> 00:07:46,816
Oh, my God. Aaron?!

228
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,601
Is that you?

229
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:50,164
Leah, hey!

230
00:07:50,352 --> 00:07:51,443
It's been forever!

231
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,606
Santos said that
you were at the Academy,

232
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,086
but I didn't believe it.

233
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,914
You're really a cop.
This is amazing.

234
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:59,090
Yeah. Uh, he still has to
finish his training.

235
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:01,125
True. Um...

236
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,047
I-I should go,
but really great seeing you.

237
00:08:04,132 --> 00:08:05,397
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

238
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:06,928
I just wanted to say

239
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:09,584
that I never thought
you were guilty.

240
00:08:09,961 --> 00:08:11,276
And that's what I told
the press.

241
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,973
Every reporter
who came around, I said,

242
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:15,498
"There is no way
that he killed Patrick."

243
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,352
Yeah, I-I saw the clips.

244
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,172
That really meant a lot.

245
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,180
I think you're the only one
that stood by me.

246
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:25,812
Um, I-I should
get back to it.

247
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:26,789
Of course!

248
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,444
Uh, but, hey,
we should hang.

249
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:29,729
Are you... free tonight?

250
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:30,730
Yeah, I am!

251
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:33,341
Um, I'll ca...
I'll text you.

252
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,368
Okay.

253
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:39,522
That was my...

254
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:00,476
7-L-15, show me 10-6
on a possible

255
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:01,957
with my missing
endangered female.

256
00:09:02,048 --> 00:09:03,748
Oak at Fuller in the alley.

257
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:07,175
Linda?

258
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,242
My name's John.

259
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,281
Hi.

260
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:10,438
Nyet Policza...

261
00:09:10,752 --> 00:09:12,553
- Uh, 7-L-15, I got her...
- ya-ne Linda.

262
00:09:12,638 --> 00:09:15,281
She's 5150
or high on 11-3.

263
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,617
Send me a mental health expert
and start an ambulance.

264
00:09:17,702 --> 00:09:19,490
Did your husband
hurt you?

265
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,753
Is he even your husband?

266
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,482
Oh, boy.
Do you speak English?

267
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,004
Uh...

268
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:29,203
Okay, Linda,
let me help you.

269
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay?

270
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:32,909
- Come on.
- Mm-hmm.

271
00:09:32,994 --> 00:09:34,521
I got you.
Come this way.

272
00:09:35,624 --> 00:09:36,970
Alright,
you're gonna be...

273
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:38,055
Oh. You okay?

274
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:39,465
Easy, now.

275
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:45,781
Alright, come on.

276
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,439
It's okay. It's okay.

277
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,507
I'm not gonna
let them hurt you.

278
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,844
Just get inside.

279
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:55,847
Officer!

280
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:57,424
- You found her!
- Thank God.

281
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:58,705
Control,
I need additional units

282
00:09:58,789 --> 00:09:59,819
and a supervisor
at my location.

283
00:09:59,903 --> 00:10:01,328
No, no,
there's no need for that.

284
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:02,462
Thank you
for finding her.

285
00:10:02,547 --> 00:10:04,128
She just needs
her medication.

286
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,281
We'll take it
from here.

287
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,924
Stay where you are
and show me your hands.

288
00:10:07,008 --> 00:10:07,914
Officer.

289
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,612
Your wife is going to
a hospital,

290
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:11,439
where she'll be questioned
without you present.

291
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:14,477
Now, I'll say it again...
Show me your damn hands.

292
00:10:17,138 --> 00:10:18,219
Get down!

293
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:52,525
Hey, don't!

294
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:07,865
7-L-15, two shooters escaping
in a gold sedan.

295
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:10,498
License plate
2-Sam-Adam-Mary-5-6-4.

296
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:11,587
Heading west on Fuller.

297
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,888
Female also fled
southbound on foot.

298
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,480
You okay? Yeah.

299
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:17,537
Code 4 at the scene.

300
00:11:17,622 --> 00:11:18,888
All units, be on the lookout
for suspects.

301
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:21,195
Want is a 245 on a PO
with automatic weapons.

302
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,123
How'd your missing woman
turn into this?

303
00:11:23,229 --> 00:11:24,631
I don't know.

304
00:11:24,716 --> 00:11:26,339
I knew the guy was lying
from the jump,

305
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:28,647
but I thought
it was domestic abuse.

306
00:11:28,731 --> 00:11:29,866
And when I finally caught up
with the wife,

307
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,041
it was clear
she'd been drugged,

308
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,257
and I think
she was speaking Russian.

309
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:33,476
Human trafficking?

310
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,310
Maybe. Let's go check out
the house.

311
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,426
Police!
Show yourselves now!

312
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:42,618
Clear.

313
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,381
Bedroom's clear.
Coming out.

314
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:49,668
Guys, does this place
seem strange to you?

315
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,123
All the frames have
stock photos in them.

316
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:53,910
And there are no dishes
or food in the kitchen.

317
00:11:53,994 --> 00:11:55,718
Like it's been staged,
but no one lives here.

318
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,676
And it feels a lot smaller
on the inside.

319
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:59,162
Like a reverse TARDIS.

320
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:02,053
What?
I don't only watch sports.

321
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:04,796
7-Adam-100,
be advised, suspect vehicle

322
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:06,732
was found abandoned in flames.

323
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:09,257
No sign of the occupants
or the missing woman.

324
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:10,724
Copy that.

325
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:12,638
These are 500 MCM wires.

326
00:12:12,723 --> 00:12:14,249
They're running
400 amp service here.

327
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,162
Mm-hmm.
I know what that means,

328
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:18,047
but, uh, you might have to
explain it for Tim.

329
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:21,217
Well, a typical household
runs 100 to 200 amps.

330
00:12:21,302 --> 00:12:23,832
With that, you can power your
lights, your appliances, AC.

331
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,365
You could run a pool
on 200 amps.

332
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,069
Wait, what could
they be running

333
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,099
that's bigger than
an AC or a pool?

334
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:30,280
I don't know.
There's a security panel here,

335
00:12:30,364 --> 00:12:32,108
but I've never seen
the design before.

336
00:12:32,193 --> 00:12:33,758
- What does it say?
- I couldn't tell you.

337
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:35,199
The writing's in Cyrillic.

338
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:43,728
"I don't know what the button
says, so I'll just push it"?

339
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:45,834
Definitely rethinking
that decision right now.

340
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:47,972
Whoa.

341
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:49,510
What is this?

342
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,512
You can monitor the whole
neighborhood from here.

343
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:53,601
Are human traffickers
usually this sophisticated?

344
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,607
No.
It's a safehouse.

345
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:58,084
Like, for spies?

346
00:12:58,168 --> 00:12:59,303
I've been in one before...

347
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,373
Although it was in
a different country.

348
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,849
W-What?
When? Where?

349
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:04,134
It's classified.

350
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:06,310
So, the security panel
is in Cyrillic.

351
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:07,920
The victim spoke Russian.

352
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:09,095
Both the shooters
spoke Russian.

353
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:10,967
Okay, so, this is
a Russian safehouse

354
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:14,057
in Los Angeles
three miles from the station.

355
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:15,443
Yes! I win.

356
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:18,808
B-Bailey and I
had a bet that...

357
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,595
that doesn't matter.

358
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,078
Why don't you try
and get us out of here?

359
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:23,240
Try to get us
out of here.

360
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,578
I knew it felt smaller.

361
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,373
<i>♪ Hey, sexy mummy</i>

362
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:42,774
Armory.

363
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:53,919
Clear.

364
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:57,354
Interrogation room.

365
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:58,824
Looks like they were
waterboarding your girl

366
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:00,217
before she escaped.

367
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:14,981
The minute
you drove away,

368
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,216
they knew this place
was burned.

369
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,060
They destroyed everything they
could before they abandoned it.

370
00:14:18,144 --> 00:14:20,559
Well, I don't understand.
You said she spoke Russian.

371
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:21,887
So aren't they
on the same side?

372
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:23,771
Maybe she turned against them
or was trying to defect.

373
00:14:23,855 --> 00:14:25,381
Why hasn't she called
911?

374
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:26,917
Shouldn't we be calling
the State Department?

375
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:28,745
We will, but once we do,
we got 15 minutes

376
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,224
before the feds show up
and ice us out,

377
00:14:30,308 --> 00:14:31,317
so let's make it count.

378
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:32,711
I want pictures
of everything.

379
00:14:32,796 --> 00:14:34,465
<i>7-Adam-19 to dispatch.</i>

380
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,341
<i>Show us responding to
Auto versus Bicycle</i>

381
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:38,909
<i>at East Third and Boyd.</i>

382
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,973
So, you, uh,
going out to dinner

383
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:45,590
- with that girl tonight, huh?
- Yeah.

384
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:46,551
I've been pretty nervous

385
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,076
about seeing some
of my old friends, though.

386
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,731
I mean, after I got arrested,
nobody called.

387
00:14:50,816 --> 00:14:52,298
After I got home,
nobody visited.

388
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:54,404
And most of them sold interviews
to the highest bidder.

389
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:56,059
But at least Leah
had nice things to say,

390
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:58,450
so it would be nice to salvage
at least one friendship.

391
00:14:58,535 --> 00:14:59,669
Mm.

392
00:14:59,847 --> 00:15:01,129
What?

393
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:02,575
I mean,
if she never came around,

394
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,143
is she really a friend?

395
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:05,551
It took you
long enough.

396
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:07,240
Were you the one who called
about the accident, sir?

397
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,896
Yeah, I was, uh...
I was down the street,

398
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,942
and I saw a car plow
into this guy on a bike.

399
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:12,988
Uh, he couldn't walk.

400
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:14,559
Looked like his legs
were broken.

401
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:16,107
Heard the guy in the car...
The driver...

402
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:18,629
He said something about
a-a hospital.

403
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:20,588
Put him in the back seat,
and they drove off.

404
00:15:20,673 --> 00:15:22,548
- Did you get a good look at the driver?
- No.

405
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,184
Can you describe
the vehicle?

406
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:26,056
Maybe give us
a license plate number?

407
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:27,864
Eh, no, I didn't get
the license plate.

408
00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:31,004
But it was a silver Civic,
for sure.

409
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:33,964
Alright, here's my card in case
you think of anything else.

410
00:15:34,087 --> 00:15:35,393
Okay, thanks.

411
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:38,590
Nearest hospital's
a few blocks away.

412
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:39,661
Should we head there?

413
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:41,614
Yeah, as soon as
you document the scene.

414
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,497
On it.

415
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:47,826
Is that
your city-issued phone?

416
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:49,873
Oh, no, I... it's back
in the War Bags.

417
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,354
Okay, uh, I'm gonna ask you
a question,

418
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:54,662
and I cannot
emphasize enough

419
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:57,450
- how much I do not want you to answer it.
- Okay.

420
00:15:57,535 --> 00:16:00,302
What is the most embarrassing
photo you have in your phone?

421
00:16:00,387 --> 00:16:02,109
Well, I have, uh...

422
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:03,371
Ah, ah-ah-ah.

423
00:16:03,455 --> 00:16:05,458
Don't answer it.
Just hold it in your head.

424
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:08,209
Now, picture it
being entered into evidence

425
00:16:08,294 --> 00:16:09,817
because it's on
the same hard drive

426
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,381
as these
crime scene photos.

427
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,549
I'm gonna get
the digital camera.

428
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,169
That's a good choice.

429
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:22,669
No.

430
00:16:23,013 --> 00:16:24,801
No. No!

431
00:16:24,955 --> 00:16:26,524
It's an oven in there!

432
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:29,442
How long has the fridge
been broken?

433
00:16:29,527 --> 00:16:30,825
It's broken?

434
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:35,793
The break room fridge
croaked.

435
00:16:35,878 --> 00:16:37,448
We need a new one ASAP.

436
00:16:37,606 --> 00:16:39,020
For your...

437
00:16:39,105 --> 00:16:41,154
Breast milk? Yes.

438
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:42,671
Okay. Okay.

439
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:44,760
Get a general services
request form

440
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,109
from the front desk.

441
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:47,981
Fill it out and bring it by
for my signature.

442
00:16:48,065 --> 00:16:49,662
Great.
So, we'll have it by...?

443
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:50,864
Hard to say.

444
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:53,294
Has to be approved by a manager
and the manager's manager.

445
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,804
The city solicits three bids.

446
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:57,156
And at that point,
Jack won't need breast milk.

447
00:16:57,248 --> 00:16:59,051
He'll need liquor
for his wedding.

448
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,356
Just getting bail
will be an uphill battle.

449
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:04,258
I'm hearing
a lot of problems.

450
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:06,260
I'm not hearing
any solutions.

451
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,293
Look, if you want to walk
out of prison before you're 60,

452
00:17:12,863 --> 00:17:14,041
take a deal.

453
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,310
Testify against Elijah.

454
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:18,794
I'm not
gonna betray my boss.

455
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:21,144
Loyalty above all.

456
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:22,676
You can write that down.

457
00:17:22,795 --> 00:17:24,843
This is not a test, okay?

458
00:17:24,927 --> 00:17:26,497
I-I'm not reporting
back to him.

459
00:17:26,581 --> 00:17:27,973
Well,
then that's way worse.

460
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:30,500
You're dumb enough to make
a move against Elijah?

461
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:32,271
He'll murder everyone
you've ever talked to.

462
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:34,185
Not if his assets are seized

463
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,629
and he's in prison
for the rest of his life.

464
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,723
The world is lousy with people
that were untouchable...

465
00:17:40,332 --> 00:17:41,424
Until they weren't.

466
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,887
That's a really nice
speech.

467
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:46,286
But I'm not buying it.

468
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:49,333
Tell Elijah he can count
on my silence.

469
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:57,465
I got your 911.
What's wrong?

470
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:00,389
These are good at room temp
for one more hour.

471
00:18:00,473 --> 00:18:02,997
I need you to take this home
to our fridge ASAP.

472
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,283
The fridge here died.

473
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:05,677
I was in a meeting
with a client.

474
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:07,122
It's my first day back.

475
00:18:07,207 --> 00:18:09,821
I can't afford to be running home
every 2 to 3 hours.

476
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:10,931
What, and I can?

477
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:12,069
Your clients are in lockup.

478
00:18:12,153 --> 00:18:13,414
They're not going anywhere.

479
00:18:13,498 --> 00:18:15,184
Plus, you owe me.

480
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,547
For what?

481
00:18:17,632 --> 00:18:20,004
How about
the 12 hours of labor?

482
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:21,874
Why are you
so pissy today?

483
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,613
I'm trying to feed
your son.

484
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:25,729
I'm sorry.

485
00:18:25,969 --> 00:18:28,559
Just a... difficult client.

486
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:31,800
I'll stop by the house.

487
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:33,067
Thank you.

488
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:46,793
Here we go.

489
00:18:47,023 --> 00:18:48,457
Howdy!

490
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,862
Sergeant Bradford, right?

491
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:51,408
You're not from
the State Department.

492
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:52,942
CIA?

493
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:54,846
Mike Weston.
Good to meet you.

494
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:57,284
The CIA has a field office
in West Hollywood.

495
00:18:57,368 --> 00:18:59,286
They throw a surprisingly fun
holiday party.

496
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,942
But they're not allowed to
operate domestically.

497
00:19:01,026 --> 00:19:03,205
Not without a supervising
federal agency.

498
00:19:03,429 --> 00:19:05,564
FBI agent Walter Reynolds
over there, he's in charge.

499
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,902
Reynolds!

500
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:08,860
This man would like to see
some ID.

501
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,621
It's his case.

502
00:19:13,706 --> 00:19:15,410
I'm just helping out
where I can.

503
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:17,195
Great, so do we liaise
with him or you?

504
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,332
Uh, neither.

505
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:19,989
We're taking over the scene...
And the case.

506
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:21,922
You mean the case where two Russian spies
tried to murder me?

507
00:19:22,006 --> 00:19:25,012
Oh, now, let's not
go throwing around the "S" word.

508
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,276
Suffice it to say,
we will move heaven and earth

509
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:29,018
to get these bad people
off the streets.

510
00:19:29,103 --> 00:19:30,717
So if you'll just turn over
whatever evidence

511
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,106
you've collected... Uh, actually,

512
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:34,190
Sergeant Bradford advised us
that federal law enforcement

513
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:35,278
would be doing
the collecting,

514
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:37,408
so we just secured
the scene.

515
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:41,979
Smart man.

516
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:44,622
Agent Reynolds' card
for your report.

517
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:47,340
Let's go, folks!

518
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,871
So, that's it?
We're out?

519
00:19:53,956 --> 00:19:56,603
You know, Linda stumbled
and touched the hood of my shop.

520
00:19:56,688 --> 00:19:57,953
I bet her fingerprints
are still on it.

521
00:19:58,037 --> 00:19:59,347
We can get a true ID...

522
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:01,847
Solve this thing before Weston
knows what hit him.

523
00:20:09,935 --> 00:20:11,897
This rust-bucket
is our loaner fridge?

524
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:13,182
Did you bring it here
from the 1950s?

525
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:14,894
Take it back.

526
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,012
Why is pumping so hard?

527
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:25,364
Uh, paranoid me thinks
it is a society-wide plot

528
00:20:25,449 --> 00:20:27,242
to push us out of
the work force.

529
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,824
And not-paranoid you?

530
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:30,911
I don't listen to her.
She's too naive.

531
00:20:32,062 --> 00:20:33,936
Uh, I have
a case file for you.

532
00:20:34,029 --> 00:20:35,425
Driver hits a guy on a bicycle,

533
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,166
scoops him up
to take him to the hospital,

534
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,342
but they never make it
to the hospital.

535
00:20:39,426 --> 00:20:40,822
Which makes it
a missing-persons.

536
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,040
Yeah, or an abduction.

537
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:44,434
Silver Civic,
the most common car in L.A.

538
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:46,958
Sure, I can add "wild goose chase"
to my to-do list.

539
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:49,222
Look, the boot and I will do
all the leg work.

540
00:20:49,306 --> 00:20:50,701
You just tell us
what you need.

541
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:52,340
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

542
00:20:53,937 --> 00:20:56,900
Heard you had some excitement
today. You okay?

543
00:20:57,314 --> 00:20:59,928
Yeah, uh, though getting shot at
never stops being upsetting.

544
00:21:00,012 --> 00:21:01,582
Yeah. Weird how
that happens, huh?

545
00:21:01,666 --> 00:21:04,193
Am I the only one
who thinks that's insane?

546
00:21:04,277 --> 00:21:06,848
I mean, our delegate helps
decide what goes into the MOA.

547
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,208
They shape policy.

548
00:21:08,293 --> 00:21:10,771
Yeah, but they also shape
our benefits package,

549
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:13,166
and no one is more focused
on benefits than Smitty.

550
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:16,431
Right, but they could
help shape policy.

551
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:19,747
I mean, the right person
with a stellar reputation

552
00:21:19,832 --> 00:21:22,631
who... understands the issues,
who believes in reform...

553
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:23,687
No, no, no, no, no.

554
00:21:23,772 --> 00:21:25,373
- No chance at all.
- Come on.

555
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,693
You would be so great at it,

556
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:27,825
and everybody
would vote for you.

557
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:30,122
- Running means campaigning.
- Yeah.

558
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:33,365
And campaigning means
being nice to people.

559
00:21:33,613 --> 00:21:35,574
- Right. What was I thinking?
- You weren't.

560
00:21:35,659 --> 00:21:37,466
- Glad you're okay.
- Thank you.

561
00:21:38,996 --> 00:21:41,784
Nolan, we just got
a partial print off your shop.

562
00:21:42,228 --> 00:21:44,842
Linda's real name
is Katerina Antonov.

563
00:21:44,926 --> 00:21:46,888
She's a Russian citizen
here on an NGO visa.

564
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,847
Perfect cover
for a Russian FSB agent.

565
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,944
We get any hits off VICAP that
could lead us to her?

566
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:53,076
No, but I did do
an Internet photo search,

567
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:54,765
and I ended up
on the Instagram page

568
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:57,638
of an Air Force major
named Lyle Marks.

569
00:21:57,722 --> 00:21:59,772
Apparently, he and Katerina had
been dating for a few months.

570
00:21:59,856 --> 00:22:01,774
And by "dating,"
you mean she was using him

571
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,429
to steal
top-secret intelligence.

572
00:22:03,597 --> 00:22:04,906
Cynic.

573
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,240
But, yeah,
there's no way

574
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,852
a spy would just happen to fall
for an Air Force major.

575
00:22:09,942 --> 00:22:11,622
Look, Lyle worked at
Drone Command.

576
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,069
Didn't show up
for work today.

577
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:14,220
- Do we loop in Weston?
- No.

578
00:22:14,304 --> 00:22:16,570
If we're on to something,
he'll find us.

579
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,921
<i>♪ ...like
an STD from a whore ♪</i>

580
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,879

581
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:23,541

582

<i>♪ 'Cause this is
as good as it gets ♪</i>

583
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:28,364
Clear.

584
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,448
Clear.

585
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:34,145
I got a body!

586
00:22:39,531 --> 00:22:40,753
His skin is cool.

587
00:22:40,838 --> 00:22:41,794
He's been dead
at least an hour.

588
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,466
So, we have a Russian spy
who was tortured

589
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:44,966
and held captive
by her own people.

590
00:22:45,051 --> 00:22:46,752
Now her boyfriend ends up
tortured and killed.

591
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:48,436
Probably the same guys
who tried to kill Katerina,

592
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,763
thinking he knew
where she was.

593
00:22:49,848 --> 00:22:52,388
- Maybe he did.
- Maybe they're going after her right now.

594
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:56,169
What a treat.

595
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,000
Twice in one day.

596
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:01,661
I take that back.

597
00:23:01,766 --> 00:23:02,896
What the hell
are we in the middle of?

598
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,741
And don't give me any of this
"national security" BS.

599
00:23:04,825 --> 00:23:06,097
It's not BS.

600
00:23:06,181 --> 00:23:07,534
You of all people
should know that.

601
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:09,037
And you should know
that a murdered soldier

602
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:11,561
means you can't keep this
in the shadows any longer.

603
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:14,174
These people need to be caught
before they hurt anyone else,

604
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:15,841
and you need our help
to do it.

605
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,231
Okay.

606
00:23:20,043 --> 00:23:22,731
But we need a secure place to
finish this conversation.

607
00:23:23,113 --> 00:23:25,286
Luckily, I bring one with me
wherever I go.

608
00:23:29,803 --> 00:23:31,294
This is a giant
Faraday cage?

609
00:23:31,379 --> 00:23:33,907
Exactly. No electronic signals
can get in or out.

610
00:23:33,992 --> 00:23:35,286
So, tell us
about Katerina.

611
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:37,942
Our belief is that Ms. Antonov
is an FSB case officer

612
00:23:38,197 --> 00:23:40,087
who was in this country to
recruit intelligence assets

613
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:41,306
and that she went rogue.

614
00:23:41,391 --> 00:23:42,830
Which is why two guys
grabbed her

615
00:23:42,914 --> 00:23:44,135
- and took her to a safehouse.
- Yep.

616
00:23:44,219 --> 00:23:46,399
Oriel Stanislov
and Vladik Ziven.

617
00:23:46,483 --> 00:23:48,247
FSB spec ops officers.

618
00:23:48,438 --> 00:23:51,270
They arrived in this country
a week ago under assumed names.

619
00:23:51,401 --> 00:23:53,606
But why try and kill her
once she escaped?

620
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:55,896
So she wouldn't end up
in the hands of the CIA.

621
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:57,890
Did you know she was in
a relationship with Major Marks?

622
00:23:57,974 --> 00:23:59,281
Obviously not.

623
00:23:59,365 --> 00:24:01,283
Otherwise, we would have
stepped in weeks ago.

624
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:03,503
Well, maybe we were
too cynical earlier.

625
00:24:03,587 --> 00:24:05,200
Maybe she really did
fall in love with Marks

626
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:07,376
and the FSB found out
she was going to defect,

627
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,731
they kill him
and grabbed her.

628
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:12,122
Espionage isn't a romance novel,
Officer Chen.

629
00:24:12,207 --> 00:24:13,427
I mean,
how would you know?

630
00:24:13,512 --> 00:24:15,076
You didn't even know
there was a Russian safehouse

631
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,403
in Los Angeles.

632
00:24:18,776 --> 00:24:20,114
Fair point,

633
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:22,169
but I've read
Katerina's file.

634
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:24,052
She's no hopeless romantic.

635
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,388
Do you at least know
why she targeted Marks?

636
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,966
He was in charge of

637
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:32,099
the Air Force's West Coast
Drone Command.

638
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:34,040
He had the keys
to the entire program.

639
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,514
So, if she wasn't stealing
secrets from Russia

640
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:37,449
and she wasn't in love with
Marks and planning to defect,

641
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:38,928
then what the hell
was she doing?

642
00:24:39,082 --> 00:24:40,395
I don't know.

643
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,278
And that's what scares
the hell out of me.

644
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:51,928
What's going on?

645
00:24:52,013 --> 00:24:52,813
It's the end of the day,

646
00:24:52,897 --> 00:24:54,497
you haven't even cleared
the non-workers.

647
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,418
Because I spent
most of my day drowning

648
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,567
in a "Brazil" -style
bureaucratic hellscape.

649
00:24:59,652 --> 00:25:01,700
Oh, is this about the, uh...
The, you know... the...

650
00:25:01,948 --> 00:25:03,344
Breast milk?
Yes.

651
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:05,607
Just say it.
It's not a swear word.

652
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:08,002
It's not a magic curse
that will bring forth a demon.

653
00:25:08,086 --> 00:25:09,458
It's a word.

654
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:10,763
Breast.

655
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,853
You know, I think
I'll check back in the morning.

656
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:14,586
Coward.

657
00:25:14,671 --> 00:25:15,849
A token of thanks

658
00:25:15,934 --> 00:25:18,288
to the fine men and women
at Mid-Wilshire.

659
00:25:18,373 --> 00:25:20,291
It's gorgeous.
Thank you.

660
00:25:20,474 --> 00:25:21,489
Mm!

661
00:25:21,574 --> 00:25:23,275
Hey, I'm really sorry
about earlier.

662
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:25,374
We've both been under
a lot of stress.

663
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,638
Thank you
for not being part

664
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:29,106
of the massive,
society-wide conspiracy.

665
00:25:29,673 --> 00:25:31,044
Don't mention it.

666
00:25:32,186 --> 00:25:33,452
Nyla!

667
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:34,768
- I'll see you at home?
- Yeah.

668
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:37,959
I got an ID on
your missing biker...

669
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:39,076
Ken Haverfield.

670
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,774
I just got off the phone
with his boyfriend.

671
00:25:40,858 --> 00:25:42,373
Ken just got out of rehab.

672
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,131
The boyfriend
didn't report Ken missing

673
00:25:44,216 --> 00:25:45,909
because he just assumed
Ken relapsed.

674
00:25:45,993 --> 00:25:47,100
Well, he didn't fall off
the wagon.

675
00:25:47,184 --> 00:25:49,809
He got hit by a car
and abducted by some psycho.

676
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,146
The victim in
Nolan's dope house arson

677
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:53,700
was a recovering addict,

678
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:55,591
and he had a fractured pelvis

679
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:57,411
consistent with
being hit by a car.

680
00:25:57,496 --> 00:25:58,804
You think that
your serial killer

681
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:00,365
is the same guy
that hit Ken?

682
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:02,448
It's a great way to
incapacitate a victim,

683
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:04,239
force them to rely on you
for help.

684
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:05,633
If it is the same killer,

685
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,325
there's gonna be
another fire tonight...

686
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,240
Tomorrow at the latest.

687
00:26:09,349 --> 00:26:10,977
And our only lead
is that he drives

688
00:26:11,062 --> 00:26:12,632
the most popular car
in L.A...

689
00:26:12,716 --> 00:26:14,419
And we don't have
a plate number.

690
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:18,825
Okay, so, no one is ever
100% successful, right?

691
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,002
This guy must have targeted
a victim at some point

692
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:23,092
who insisted on waiting
for an ambulance.

693
00:26:23,177 --> 00:26:24,617
At which point
he would have fled,

694
00:26:24,702 --> 00:26:26,788
and the responding officer would
have filed a hit-and-run.

695
00:26:26,872 --> 00:26:29,164
I could run a search,
but there's going to be dozens,

696
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:30,974
maybe hundreds
of initial hits.

697
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:32,478
I will do it.

698
00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:33,479
Are you sure?

699
00:26:33,563 --> 00:26:34,654
Yes, I'm sure.

700
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:36,133
I will split it
with the midnight shift.

701
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:37,724
We'll start running down
some leads.

702
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:39,528
You go home to Jack.

703
00:26:39,612 --> 00:26:40,703
He misses his mama.

704
00:26:40,788 --> 00:26:42,889
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

705
00:26:44,442 --> 00:26:45,529
I thought we were going
for dinner.

706
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:47,177
Yeah, the club has apps.

707
00:26:48,012 --> 00:26:49,739
Yeah, and like
a million people.

708
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:51,373
And more than
a few paparazzi.

709
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,794
You're right.
We should get our own exclusive.

710
00:26:54,879 --> 00:26:55,848
No, I'm...
I'm not doing that.

711
00:26:55,933 --> 00:26:56,950
No.

712
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,389
Come on!

713
00:26:58,474 --> 00:27:00,044
Just relax.
We're gonna have fun.

714
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:03,575
You didn't bring me out
to reconnect.

715
00:27:04,199 --> 00:27:06,083
This is just so you can get
more followers.

716
00:27:06,216 --> 00:27:07,307
No!

717
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,298
Well, I mean, yeah,
we could both benefit, but...

718
00:27:11,383 --> 00:27:12,561
Nah, I'm out.

719
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:14,669
Aaron.
Aaron, wait.

720
00:27:14,821 --> 00:27:16,565
<i>This quiet community
was rocked</i>

721
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:18,809
<i>by the suspicion that fell
on the Gallagher home.</i>

722
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:20,830
<i>Police executed
a search warrant,</i>

723
00:27:20,914 --> 00:27:22,963
<i>removing several items,
including clothes...</i>

724
00:27:23,047 --> 00:27:24,755
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's Aaron.</i>

725
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,521
Yeah, can I speak to
P1 Lucy?

726
00:27:26,606 --> 00:27:28,387
I got a rookie situation
I need to discuss.

727
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,024
Yeah, yeah, sure thing.

728
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:31,599
Hold on.
Um, okay,

729
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,626
here she comes.

730
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,599
Talk to me.

731
00:27:34,684 --> 00:27:38,083
So, I just tried to go
out with an old friend

732
00:27:38,177 --> 00:27:40,884
from before my life
got turned upside down,

733
00:27:40,969 --> 00:27:44,411
and it was like
talking to an alien.

734
00:27:44,525 --> 00:27:47,187
Yeah, becoming a cop
is isolating enough

735
00:27:47,272 --> 00:27:48,700
with no one but other cops

736
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:50,692
able to understand
the experience.

737
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,130
It must be so much harder
for you.

738
00:27:53,268 --> 00:27:54,646
I mean,
how did you handle it?

739
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:56,864
The... The isolation.

740
00:27:56,949 --> 00:27:59,091
I made new friends
with the only people

741
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:01,530
who could relate...
The rookies I came up with.

742
00:28:01,615 --> 00:28:04,192
Yeah, my Academy classmates
call me "No Biz,"

743
00:28:04,588 --> 00:28:06,483
as in, "You have no business
being a cop."

744
00:28:06,668 --> 00:28:08,474
Oof, I'm sorry.

745
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,521
I can't imagine
doing this alone.

746
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,350
There were three of us
in our class,

747
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:14,961
and we were inseparable.

748
00:28:15,046 --> 00:28:18,794
Yeah, it was you, Nolan,
and... and who was the third?

749
00:28:21,727 --> 00:28:23,383
Um...

750
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:24,669
Right.

751
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:27,604
Uh, sorry.
The... The guy who, uh...

752
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,864
Died.

753
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:31,247
Yeah.

754
00:28:34,175 --> 00:28:35,747
Sneaks up on you,
doesn't it?

755
00:28:36,903 --> 00:28:39,795
I mean,
I'll just be going along,

756
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,693
talking about whatever,

757
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:42,966
and then something
reminds me of Patrick

758
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:44,225
just lying there
dead on the floor,

759
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:46,013
and... bam.

760
00:28:46,514 --> 00:28:48,044
It's like being
hit by a truck.

761
00:28:50,198 --> 00:28:51,594
I-I...
I-I-I'm sorry.

762
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,341
I shouldn't
be bringing this up.

763
00:28:53,426 --> 00:28:54,348
I sh... I should go.

764
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,442
No, no.

765
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:56,618
No need to apologize.

766
00:28:56,703 --> 00:28:58,833
I-I'm...
I'm glad you called.

767
00:28:58,918 --> 00:28:59,833
Yeah, me too.

768
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:01,451
You know,
I spent the last two years

769
00:29:01,536 --> 00:29:04,559
feeling completely alone,
so it's...

770
00:29:05,435 --> 00:29:07,129
It's nice to have
someone to talk to.

771
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:10,629
Well, good. Good.

772
00:29:10,778 --> 00:29:12,347
You should probably
get some sleep.

773
00:29:12,432 --> 00:29:15,567
You know, you gotta bring your
A-game every day with Harper.

774
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,833
Tell me about it.

775
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:20,309
I'll see you tomorrow.

776
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:21,528
Yep.

777
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:42,287
Dispatch, this is
Detective Nyla Harper,

778
00:29:42,378 --> 00:29:44,543
badge number 56464.

779
00:29:44,628 --> 00:29:47,263
I might have eyes
on a possible kidnapping vehicle

780
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:49,338
at 9223 Sherman Drive.

781
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,637
License plate matches
a hit and run from August.

782
00:29:52,722 --> 00:29:55,864
Get me marked units and
notify Detective Lopez ASAP.

783
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,250
Dispatch, Detective Harper.

784
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:03,384
Possible suspect and possible
kidnapping victim inside.

785
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,719
Send all units Code 3.

786
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,243
I'm making entry.

787
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,328
Police!

788
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:17,653
Come out with your hands up!

789
00:30:58,674 --> 00:31:00,911
Dispatch, I have a white
male that...

790
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:06,369
LAPD!
Show me your hands!

791
00:31:56,158 --> 00:31:58,019
Even with all
the smoke inhalation,

792
00:31:58,104 --> 00:31:59,542
Harper's probably fine,
right?

793
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,043
She wasn't in
the building long.

794
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,681
She should be okay.

795
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,028
At this point, I think we can
skip the war stories

796
00:32:07,113 --> 00:32:08,659
and agree...

797
00:32:08,744 --> 00:32:11,401
Firefighters are better
than cops.

798
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:13,207
Why else
would you and Harper

799
00:32:13,292 --> 00:32:15,652
insist on running
into burning buildings?

800
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:17,050
You're jealous.

801
00:32:17,425 --> 00:32:18,995
Oh, y-yeah, no.

802
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:22,199
It's just as police,
we can't simply stand by

803
00:32:22,346 --> 00:32:24,207
and do nothing when we know
we could be helping.

804
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:27,294
Okay, well, I guess we do have
to do the war story contest.

805
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,123
Agreed.
You go first.

806
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:30,909
Okay, last year,

807
00:32:30,994 --> 00:32:33,129
I got caught alone
in the canyon

808
00:32:33,274 --> 00:32:36,454
as a fire was racing
up the hill behind me.

809
00:32:36,577 --> 00:32:37,823
You can't outrun it,

810
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:40,130
so I had to light up
the brush around me.

811
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,325
I'm sorry, you...
You're stuck in a wildfire,

812
00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:43,500
so you lit a fire?

813
00:32:43,584 --> 00:32:45,633
Right.
The brush burns away...

814
00:32:45,717 --> 00:32:47,330
Along with half
my eyebrows...

815
00:32:47,414 --> 00:32:49,332
And I wrap myself
in a fire blanket

816
00:32:49,416 --> 00:32:51,944
in the middle of
the burnt-out patch.

817
00:32:52,028 --> 00:32:53,370
I go fetal.

818
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:55,948
Wildfire lighting up
all around me,

819
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:58,378
burning at 1,200 degrees.

820
00:32:58,512 --> 00:33:00,886
But because it's not
right on top of me,

821
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:04,195
I only parboil
as the fire pushes past me.

822
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:06,027
The doctor said
we can see her now.

823
00:33:06,191 --> 00:33:07,761
Alright.

824
00:33:09,436 --> 00:33:10,933
Hey.

825
00:33:11,534 --> 00:33:13,334
You just had to try
and one-up me, didn't you?

826
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:16,657
"Try"?

827
00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:17,920
Yeah,
she's alright.

828
00:33:18,005 --> 00:33:19,096
Did you catch the guy?

829
00:33:19,272 --> 00:33:20,798
No. By the time
back-up landed,

830
00:33:20,905 --> 00:33:21,953
he was gone.

831
00:33:24,408 --> 00:33:25,281
What about the car?

832
00:33:25,365 --> 00:33:26,737
Uh, can we track it?

833
00:33:26,822 --> 00:33:29,023
He drove it a couple miles out
and torched it.

834
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:31,461
Burned up any DNA
that would have been inside.

835
00:33:31,545 --> 00:33:33,724
We ran the VIN number,
but the car was as stolen

836
00:33:33,808 --> 00:33:35,128
as the license plate
he put on it.

837
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:37,753
So, we are
back at square one.

838
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:39,685
What about the guy
Harper pulled out of the fire?

839
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:41,831
- Can he ID him?
- Ken's still in surgery.

840
00:33:41,916 --> 00:33:45,043
The doctor said he has a chance,
but he lost a lot of blood.

841
00:33:45,128 --> 00:33:46,714
Mm.

842
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:50,542
Hey, we'll get out of
your burned hair.

843
00:33:51,024 --> 00:33:52,071
You guys go.

844
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:53,435
I just need to get down
a few details

845
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,745
while her memory's fresh.

846
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:56,448
- Glad you're okay.
- Me too.

847
00:33:56,761 --> 00:33:58,007
Hmm, thank you.

848
00:34:00,646 --> 00:34:02,042
You feel better?

849
00:34:02,228 --> 00:34:04,190
Yeah, I do.
Thank you.

850
00:34:04,274 --> 00:34:05,800
I'd say this was
another stellar date.

851
00:34:05,884 --> 00:34:06,801
Wouldn't you?

852
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:07,976
At least we finally put

853
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,480
"cops versus firefighters"
to bed.

854
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,739
Ah, heh, no.
No, we haven't.

855
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:17,425
You think
you can beat my story?

856
00:34:17,548 --> 00:34:20,925
Two words...
"Russian safehouse."

857
00:34:22,063 --> 00:34:24,372
Unless "safehouse"
is two separate words.

858
00:34:24,457 --> 00:34:25,693
In which case,
I have three words...

859
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:26,793
"Russian safe house."

860
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:29,171
Look,
just this very morning,

861
00:34:29,255 --> 00:34:31,730
I uncovered
a Russian FSB safehouse

862
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:33,828
when two Russian agents
tried to kill me

863
00:34:33,912 --> 00:34:36,048
for helping
a third Russian agent

864
00:34:36,132 --> 00:34:38,652
that they were sent after to
capture who had gone rogue.

865
00:34:38,737 --> 00:34:41,661
Only no one could figure out
what kind of rogue she had gone

866
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,613
because the Air Force major
that she was sleeping with

867
00:34:44,698 --> 00:34:45,573
turned up murdered.

868
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:47,722
Now, we don't know
whether she was using him

869
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:49,625
or actually in love with him

870
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:51,114
or whether the two agents
that killed him

871
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:52,629
did so
to tie up a loose end,

872
00:34:52,713 --> 00:34:55,890
or if they were just using him
to try to capture her again.

873
00:34:58,718 --> 00:34:59,848
Damn it, you win.

874
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:00,942
And now we know.

875
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:02,185
Cops are better
than firefighters.

876
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,510
Oh, I can't.

877
00:35:03,698 --> 00:35:05,947
Forget war stories.

878
00:35:06,031 --> 00:35:07,079
Let's spar for the title.

879
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:08,341
Okay, we're doing this.Uh-huh.

880
00:35:08,425 --> 00:35:10,212
Okay, I'm... Oh, hold on.

881
00:35:10,296 --> 00:35:11,518
Come on.

882
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:13,034
You scared?

883
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,208
Definitely, but, um,

884
00:35:15,425 --> 00:35:17,456
Katerina had something
in her left fist

885
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:18,568
when I found her.

886
00:35:18,652 --> 00:35:19,569
I'm not following.

887
00:35:19,653 --> 00:35:20,761
The third spy...

888
00:35:20,846 --> 00:35:23,007
The one the other two
were trying to kill...

889
00:35:23,092 --> 00:35:25,448
She had something
in her left hand

890
00:35:25,535 --> 00:35:26,888
when I put her in the shop.

891
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:29,709
But afterwards...
After they tried to kill us...

892
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,842
I remember pulling her
out of the shop.

893
00:35:31,926 --> 00:35:33,386
Stay low!

894
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:35,471
Her hands were empty.

895
00:35:35,795 --> 00:35:37,543
And you think
she left it in there...

896
00:35:37,628 --> 00:35:39,362
Whatever "it" is.

897
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,183
One way to find out.

898
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:45,672
- Alright.
- Welcome.

899
00:35:45,765 --> 00:35:47,941
You take me
to all the best places.

900
00:35:49,205 --> 00:35:52,124
That's a lot of security
for a bunch of busted-up cars.

901
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,039
That's to keep the chain
of custody secure.

902
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:55,866
My shop hasn't been
processed yet,

903
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,566
so if Katerina
left anything behind...

904
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:00,903
it will
still be in there.

905
00:36:02,876 --> 00:36:04,486
Here we go.

906
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:07,152
You were in this thing?

907
00:36:07,325 --> 00:36:09,620
Yeah.
Well, a-adjacent.

908
00:36:13,096 --> 00:36:14,309
What's wrong?

909
00:36:14,394 --> 00:36:16,625
I'm just used to being the one
that gets worried about,

910
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,106
not the one who's worrying.

911
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,239
Oh, you don't have to worry
about me.

912
00:36:20,323 --> 00:36:21,892
Yeah, famous last words.

913
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:23,946
Oh, that's dark.

914
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:25,975
Alright.

915
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:27,547
Let's see what we got.

916
00:36:35,164 --> 00:36:36,164
I got something.

917
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,773
It's a flash drive.

918
00:36:46,735 --> 00:36:48,305
Give me the drive,
and I'll let her go.

919
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,418
No one needs to get hurt.

920
00:36:49,503 --> 00:36:50,712
What's on it
that's so important?

921
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:52,891
A list of men
involved in a drone strike.

922
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:54,127
Why do you care?

923
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,102
My brother was in
the building they hit.

924
00:36:57,729 --> 00:36:59,148
He was a doctor.

925
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,236
He didn't deserve
to die.

926
00:37:02,321 --> 00:37:03,891
So, Marks launched
the strike.

927
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:05,766
You killed him,
stole the drive,

928
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:07,251
but Oriel and Vladik
grabbed you

929
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:08,287
before you could do
anything with it.

930
00:37:08,371 --> 00:37:09,463
And you're planning on
killing

931
00:37:09,547 --> 00:37:10,736
the rest of the men
on the list.

932
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:12,109
That's justice, no?

933
00:37:12,592 --> 00:37:14,578
Isn't that what your badge
stands for?

934
00:37:14,711 --> 00:37:16,117
Now...

935
00:37:16,611 --> 00:37:19,336
give me the drive,
and she lives.

936
00:37:36,943 --> 00:37:38,794
Come...

937
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,096
Come on!

938
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,156
Flat on your stomach!
Hands and legs out!

939
00:37:58,334 --> 00:37:59,580
Spread 'em, now!

940
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,290
You okay?
Yeah.

941
00:38:02,468 --> 00:38:03,646
She's got some skills.

942
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,126
She's not the only one.

943
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,259
Here, cuff her up
nice and tight.

944
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:09,083
You're under arrest.

945
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:11,620
Officer Nolan.

946
00:38:11,818 --> 00:38:13,960
Let me guess...
Tracking me through my phone?

947
00:38:14,045 --> 00:38:15,377
I'm not really
at liberty to say.

948
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:17,597
And now you just expect me
to hand her over to you?

949
00:38:17,682 --> 00:38:18,747
No, not to me...

950
00:38:18,832 --> 00:38:20,272
To Agent Reynolds.

951
00:38:20,356 --> 00:38:22,622
Lieutenant Nune,
how are you tonight?

952
00:38:22,706 --> 00:38:24,276
- Do I know you?
- Uh, no,

953
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,909
but any friend of
Officer Nolan's.

954
00:38:26,043 --> 00:38:27,869
Hey, w-wait, what about, uh,
the other two?

955
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,574
What about, uh,
Oriel and what's-his-name?

956
00:38:29,658 --> 00:38:31,185
Oh, we picked them up
an hour ago.

957
00:38:31,297 --> 00:38:32,363
Thanks for your help
with this.

958
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:33,981
Agent Reynolds will coordinate
with your sergeant

959
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:35,591
on the paperwork.

960
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:38,510
Lieutenant?

961
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,319
I told you I was in
the Army Reserve.

962
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,557
Yeah, but you didn't say
Lieutenant.

963
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,904
Well, yeah.

964
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:45,057
Thank you
for your service.

965
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,336
Mm-hmm.

966
00:38:46,977 --> 00:38:48,594
We should really have
a normal date.

967
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:49,941
Yeah.

968
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:55,610
Look,
I'm doing everything I can,

969
00:38:55,695 --> 00:38:58,091
but as of now,
I think Aiden's best chance

970
00:38:58,176 --> 00:38:59,267
is a forgiving jury.

971
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:01,266
Oh, you can stop working
on his case.

972
00:39:01,351 --> 00:39:02,964
Yeah, the prison's
about to call...

973
00:39:03,072 --> 00:39:05,516
Just as soon as they find
Aiden's body in his cell.

974
00:39:10,938 --> 00:39:12,287
You had him killed?

975
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:16,076
- Why?!
- Word on the street was,

976
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:17,948
he was talking like
he was gonna turn on me.

977
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:20,653
Look, as far as I know,
he was completely loyal to you.

978
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:22,922
Right.
10 years of service.

979
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,204
One meeting with you,
and he gets squirrelly.

980
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:27,696
No, we...
We talked legal strategy.

981
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:29,211
That's it.

982
00:39:31,426 --> 00:39:32,821
Alright.

983
00:39:33,033 --> 00:39:35,778
I know that you have a reason
to be nervous, okay?

984
00:39:36,026 --> 00:39:39,172
But I won't do anything
to endanger my family.

985
00:39:41,195 --> 00:39:42,727
That you can count on.

986
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,008
Final warning.

987
00:40:08,557 --> 00:40:10,946
How did you get that fridge
for the break room?

988
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,986
That brand
costs more than my car.

989
00:40:13,071 --> 00:40:14,168
Wesley bought it,

990
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:16,282
so I guess, technically,
I bought it.

991
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:18,781
So, that's the solution?
To pay out of pocket?

992
00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:20,767
There really has to be somebody
who could've helped with that.

993
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:23,263
I thought about asking
my union delegate to step in,

994
00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:24,962
but he once asked me,
quote,

995
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,528
"Why do women
need tampons?

996
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:28,046
Can't they just hold it?"

997
00:40:28,131 --> 00:40:29,263
So...

998
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:31,669
Someone should
really run against him.

999
00:40:31,754 --> 00:40:33,236
You could.

1000
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:35,119
I am barely on the other side
of being a rookie,

1001
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:36,790
and it was a rough ride.

1002
00:40:36,875 --> 00:40:38,141
No one would vote for me.

1003
00:40:38,226 --> 00:40:39,535
I would.

1004
00:40:40,297 --> 00:40:43,196
Mainly to spite Smitty,
but, hey, a vote's a vote.

1005
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:46,054
Did you stop by
for something specific?

1006
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:47,810
Yeah, I wanted an update
on the arson case.

1007
00:40:47,894 --> 00:40:49,159
I know I'm not part of
the investigation,

1008
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:50,900
but I would love to be kept
in the loop.

I would have never made
the connection,

1011
00:40:54,736 --> 00:40:56,486
so it's your case
as much as mine.

1012
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:58,423
