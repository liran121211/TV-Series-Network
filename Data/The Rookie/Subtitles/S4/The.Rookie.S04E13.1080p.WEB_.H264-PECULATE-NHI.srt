the show.

181
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,021

I'm at my real job.

on probation,

183
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,459

okay?

184
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:58,156
No.

185
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,506
W-What do you mean, no?
You work for me.

Uh, technically,
I work for your mother.

catapult me into the sun,

From time to time.
Yeah.

522
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,503
Okay. He said he worked
two nights ago.

523
00:20:43,546 --> 00:20:45,331
Yeah,
sounds about right.

524
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:48,247
We had a construction job
down in Hawthorne.

525
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,205
Picked up the night shift
for a few extra bucks.

526
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,295
Any chance he checked
in and then maybe ducked
out for a few hours?

527
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:55,863
Nah, I was there.
I would've seen that.

528
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:57,778
You sure?

529
00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:01,825
Because, uh, Dez is suspected
in a triple murder

530
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:04,045
that happened that night,
so anyone who helps him

531
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:05,916
would be considered
an accessory.

532
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,092
Hey. Hold on.

533
00:21:08,136 --> 00:21:09,268
I had no idea about that.

534
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,052
I want no parts of that,
alright?

535
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:12,575
I thought he was just out here
cheating on his girlfriend.

536
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,273
I didn't know he was out here
killing people.

537
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,752
Does that mean you want to
amend your statement?

538
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:18,233
Hell yeah.
I'm gonna amend my statement.

539
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,062
Dez paid me 500 bucks
to clock him in

on the nights
that he needed an alibi.

541
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:25,284
Okay. So, to be clear,
Dez did not show up to work

542
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:26,850
two nights ago?
Right.

543
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:30,854
Oh, and...
he paid me yesterday

where they're hitting,

more bodies.

Let's never
do that again.

553
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:52,963
You're gonna need
a much bigger leash than that.

lots of tranquilizers.

aside from a reptile
straight out of "Jurassic Park",

560
00:22:08,239 --> 00:22:10,372
we found a bunch of fentanyl

Two quests.
Two drug arrests.

It's a good thing
you caught him.

F.S.T. stands for
something else.

587

First, you get all the guys
from the outside

588
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,343

even a sliver of a chance

He's been institutionalized.
I've seen it a thousand times.

627
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:44,134
A nice haircut and a cute smile
does not mean he is innocent.

628
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:46,310
Yeah, and a conviction doesn't
mean that he's guilty, either.

629

after our last conversation.

653
00:25:42,976 --> 00:25:44,673
Turns out Murray,
the guy with the alligator,

654

one of his known associates
is Brian Johst,

I'm guessing they have

distribution racket
running?

658
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,769
Yeah, and we'd bet money

659

that one of the dealers
they sell to

660
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:58,252
is the guy we arrested
in Quest One.

661
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,471
That's quite an epic tale.

Let's cut out this fantasy crap,

663
00:26:04,301 --> 00:26:06,390
We know you didn't send us
to that house

00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:08,436
to avenge a classmate.
There is no classmate.

665
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:12,135
But I think there is a princess
you need us to save.

666
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:15,530
Your mom -- she has
a history of drug abuse,

667
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,663
but it seems like
she'd been clean for a while?

668
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,450
She relapsed
after my dad died.

669
00:26:22,493 --> 00:26:24,974
Then she rallied,
got herself clean.

670
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:27,673
It was good,
like before.

671
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:31,677
Then she met Brian.

672
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,723
You have to get her
away from him.

673
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:37,987
He's killing her.

674
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,424
That's your third quest.
Leo out.

675
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:44,428
We have no evidence
tying Brian to the fentanyl.

676
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:45,865
We can't arrest him.

677
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:48,084

Yeah.

burglary tools, impact weapons.

Dez is about to walk out of here

Right now,
all I can charge him with

684
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:06,842

of stolen property.

685
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:09,366
Can you stall them?
20 minutes.

00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:10,803
Sorry, Sarge.

687
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:12,195

upside down.

are all we could find.

But to tell you the truth,
I was terrified.

905
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:20,194
And I needed to pretend
that it was nothing

906
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,284
and if I called you,
I would have to admit

907
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,765
that it could be something.

908
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:27,506
And I-I get that,

909
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:31,292

913

There's, uh, something
I haven't told you.

914
00:37:39,822 --> 00:37:44,000
Um...I was diagnosed
with placenta previa

915
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:47,917
when I had Lila,
and I started hemorrhaging

916
00:37:47,961 --> 00:37:49,832
late in the pregnancy.

917
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:52,139

about a little heartburn.

918

920
00:37:57,753 --> 00:38:00,539

Langston's case.

Why? I thought we agreed

He -- He paralyzed a guard.

966
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,820

be punished for that.

967

that cop 18 years ago,

968

and we owe it to that officer's
family to find the truth.

969
00:39:53,826 --> 00:39:55,262

then that means
