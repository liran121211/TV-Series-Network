1054
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,580
I know breaking up over text
isn't super mature.

1055
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,280
No. It's -- It's fine.

1056
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,450
I-I just wanted to make sure
it wasn't something I did.

1057
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,720
It's not you.
I-I know that's a cliché,

1058
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,850
but I-I really mean it.

1059
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,980
You're -- You're great.

1060
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,850
You're funny and handsome.

1061
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,590
Warm. Smart.

1062
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,730
Confused.

1063
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,340
It's just --
I'm good at a lotta things.

1064
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,080
But I am terrible
at relationships.

1065
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,390
And they all go
the same way.

1066
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,300
We'll start dating.
You'll open up.

1067
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,740
I'll distract you
with jokes

1068
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,780
so you don't notice
that I'm keeping you away,

1069
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:27,260
until you get tired
of my bull

1070
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:29,130
and you tell me
this one-sided relationship

1071
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,920
isn't working
and I'll tell you,

1072
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,700
"Well, this is who I am,
take it or leave it."

1073
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,310
And you'll leave it.

1074
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,270
So, you know,
I thought I'd skip to the end.

1075
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,450
Wow.

1076
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,620
That sounds like a lot.

1077
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,630
Well, that's me.
I'm a lot.

1078
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,320
Yeah, thing is,
I-I'm not believing it.

1079
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,190
I mean, that you're bad
at relationships --

1080
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,110
totally believable.

1081
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,330
By your own admission,
you've never --

1082
00:41:51,370 --> 00:41:53,900
never actually been in one.
Which is fine.

1083
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,940
But I am standing here as living
proof that people can change.

1084
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,470
Who you were
up until this very moment

1085
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:03,250
is not who you have to be
moving forward.

1086
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,910
So, really,
the question here is:

1087
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,740
Do I make you want to show up
differently?

1088
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:13,870
And...so that you know,
if you say that I do...

1089
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,400
I'm all in.

1090
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,360
Well...

1091
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,490
