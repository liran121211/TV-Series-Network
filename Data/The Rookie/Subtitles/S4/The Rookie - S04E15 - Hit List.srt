were you aware

177
00:06:55,502 --> 00:06:57,199
My husband usually
takes care of that.

178
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,506
Okay, well, look, I'm gonna
give you a warning this time,

179
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,290
but just know,
the next cop that pulls you over

180
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,683
might not be as forgiving, okay?

181
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,032
I understand.

182
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,816

Alright.

Who was she?

A hitter
for Matteo Rubio.

396
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:10,333
And we think she's the shooter
from our drive-by.

397
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,689
She was so fast.

398
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,919
Here he is.
How is he?

399
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:33,922
They just took him into surgery.
Uh, he's in shock.

400
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:35,097
Wound seems superficial,
but they won't know for sure

401
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:36,533
until they open him up.

402
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,100

She didn't make it.

403
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:39,493
Okay,
so, is the threat over?

404
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,234
I don't think so.

405
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:43,105
The killer at the front desk
was definitely a man.

406
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:45,281
I don't understand.
Grand juries are secret.

407
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:47,240
How did Rubio get his hands
on a witness list?

408
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,329
I'm gonna circle back
to A.D.A. Del Monte.

409
00:17:49,372 --> 00:17:52,114
We need to find out who else was
set to testify against Rubio.

410
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,681
Okay, good.
Take Lucy with you.

Everybody, listen up.

I want 'round-the-clock
security.

415
00:18:00,383 --> 00:18:02,124
These people were bold enough
to go after a cop.

416
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,734
They're not just gonna
stand down now.

417
00:18:03,778 --> 00:18:05,519
Got it?
- Okay, copy.

418
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,434
Because this is
an officer-involved shooting,

419
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:09,653
I'm gonna need to stay here
as Grey's union delegate.

420
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,177
Okay. Do you know
what you have to do?
Yes, sir.

421

Uh,
procedurally at least.

422
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,398
I-I don't know
what I'm gonna say to him.

423
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:17,400
He was with you
after your shooting.

424
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:19,141
Yeah. He's the reason
I made it through.

425
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,751
Yeah.
So do what he did.

426
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,144
He's always been there
for us.

427
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:23,798
Now it's time
to return the favor.

428
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:25,408
And update me the moment
he gets out of surgery.

429
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:27,193
Yes, sir.
What are you gonna do?

430
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,846
I'm gonna try and I.D.
our deceased shooter,

431
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,674
see if I can find out
who she was partnered with.

432
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:34,722
What Tim said --

433
00:18:34,765 --> 00:18:37,638
You've killed someone
in the line of duty?

434
00:18:37,681 --> 00:18:40,423
Yeah.
A month into my rookie year.

435
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,425
I didn't know that.

436
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,253
I don't talk about it much.

437

438
00:18:45,994 --> 00:18:48,301

that bring us face-to-face

439
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:49,954
with death every day.

440
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:53,262
But it's different
when it's because of you.

442
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,962
I did a tour
right when I signed up.

443
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,748
Every time I think
I got a handle on you...

444
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,751
Listen, do you want me
to stay with you?

445
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:05,274
I can call in a sub.

446
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:06,580
No.
You go back to work.

447
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,668
I got Wesley
to keep me company.

448
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:08,886
Okay.

449
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,323

Alright. Love you.

Yeah, thanks.

is not life-threatening.

454
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:29,037

455

457

But I could still
finish strong, right?

458
00:19:36,087 --> 00:19:38,873
I'd focus on getting to the end
of shift with no more drama.

Mr. Hayes.
I heard you were a cop.

463
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,378

No, um...

465
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:09,033
I think about you
every day,

466
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,905
what I'd say to you,
what I'd...do to you.

467
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:11,993
Okay, sir, stop.

468
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:13,473

You'll arrest me?

469

Go. Get -- Get closer,
get closer.

470
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,606

Morris:
This is a live arrest.

498
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,918
Mr. Hayes,
I'm sorry, okay?

499
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:08,832
I didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

500
00:21:08,876 --> 00:21:10,530
I'm sorry.

501
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:18,320
All the other witnesses
have been taken into
protective custody.

502
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,235
We need to put
undercover officers on
their home addresses.

503
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,150
Odds are good the assassin
will target another witness,

504
00:21:22,193 --> 00:21:23,934
and we need to be set up
to catch them.

505
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,588
I can't do that.
You know that.

506
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,590
You know the grand juries
are secret.

507
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:29,462
That's why the D.A.'s office
handles all witness security.

508
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,855
You're doing
a bang-up job so far.

509
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,162
Look, I'm gonna chalk
that one up

510
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:36,512
to misplaced anger
over what happened to Wade.

511
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,166
The best way to keep
our witnesses safe

512
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,211
is for them
to catch Rubio's hit men.

513
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:42,083
If the list helps them do that,
why not share it?

514
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:44,433
Because it doesn't work
that way.

515
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:45,956
Look, I'm sorry.
I am, okay?

516
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,089
But the case against Rubio
is far from guaranteed.

517
00:21:48,132 --> 00:21:49,786
I have to protect it.

518
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,571
Now, if you can bring me
some sort of definitive proof

519
00:21:51,614 --> 00:21:52,963
that he's behind
these attacks,

520

525
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,856

would have never thrown a punch.

526

bother to stick around

541

Uh, no, he actually asked
that I release you.

542

a wise man once told me,

585
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:38,580
"This is not something
you want your family

586
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:41,104

587
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,585
You're right.
I'll call her.

588
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:48,068
