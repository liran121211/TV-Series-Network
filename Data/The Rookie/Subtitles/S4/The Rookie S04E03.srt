1
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:16,364
Control, 7-Adam-15.

2
00:00:16,407 --> 00:00:18,757
We have a structure fire
at 8650 Magnolia.

3
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:20,716
Please notify LAFD.

4
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:21,760
You think
anyone's in there?

5
00:00:21,804 --> 00:00:22,935
Well, no one
that's supposed to be.

6
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:24,589
Help!
- Was that a scream?

7
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:28,463
Control, what's the ETA
on LAFD?

8
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:29,986
Two minutes.

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,335
That's -- That's
too long.

10
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:32,467
Control, be advised,
we're going in

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,121
to look for victims.

12
00:00:34,164 --> 00:00:35,774
#Pull me into
your coloring books#
-Ready?

13
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:38,081
# Lead me into
your bright adventures #

14
00:00:42,216 --> 00:00:44,131
# Kiss me under the mistletoe

15
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:46,350
# Open-mouth
on my brand-new dentures #

16
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,528
Geez.

17
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:52,617
Help me!

18
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:55,751
# Who met in the future
and moved to the past #

19
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:58,971
Help!
Someone help me!

20
00:00:59,015 --> 00:01:01,017
# All big men
have a gravity #

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,150
# That draws them
to the sun #

22
00:01:03,193 --> 00:01:05,674
# And gives them
their authority #

23
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,806
# And gives them
their control #

24
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,330
Whoa, man.

25
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:12,072
# Gravity that draws them
to the sun #

26
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:31,482
Is there
anyone else inside?

27
00:01:31,526 --> 00:01:33,310
- Not that we saw.
- You shouldn't have gone in.

28
00:01:33,354 --> 00:01:35,225
Well, it's kind of
our job, saving people.

29
00:01:35,269 --> 00:01:36,400
From crime.

30
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:38,402
You don't see us
running towards gunfire.

31
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:40,535
You think that's just wood smoke
you're breathing in?

32
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,667
All the toxic things in a home,
once they catch fire,

33
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:44,626
they turn to deadly gases --

34
00:01:44,669 --> 00:01:47,542
ammonia, carbon dioxide,
hydrogen cyanide.

35
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:50,153
So unless you want me
dragging your ass to safety

36
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,676
in the future,
you'll leave the rescues

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,157
to the professionals.

38
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:00,859
- How's it going
with you two?
- Really good.

39
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:02,557
# Whoa, oh, oh, oh 
Really good.

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,428
# Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh

41
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:06,996
# I'm gonna win for you

42
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,433
# Like I know
you want me to do #

43
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:10,782
How is it that
I still smell like smoke

44
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,262
after a 30-minute shower?

45
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:13,481
Welcome to my world.

46
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:14,917
You always smell
fantastic.

47
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,093
That's because I spend
half my salary on perfumes,

48
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,226
potions, and detergents.

49
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:22,359
Well, it's working.

50
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,883
Do you think
that fire was arson?

51
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,972
Maybe.
I smelled accelerant.

52
00:02:27,016 --> 00:02:28,844
The arson investigator
will know for sure.

53
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:30,541
You ever think
about doing that?

54
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,021
Arson investigation?
Yeah.

55
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,196
No.

56
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,285
I like the physical part
of firefighting.

57
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:37,461
Plus, I wouldn't have time
for all my extracurriculars --

58
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,202
Army Reserve, teaching,

59
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,334
motorcycle racing...

60
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,118
Dating me.
Dating you.

61
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,208
"Motorcycle racing"?

62
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:46,731
What is it?

63
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,951
They found a body.

64
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:54,696
- Karl.
- Hey, Bailey.

65
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,524
This is John Nolan,LAPD.

66
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,047
Hey.
He and his partner
pulled the survivor out

67
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,396
before we got here.
Ah.

68
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,963
Did you give him the lecture
about how stupid it is

69
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:02,834
to go into a structure fire
without a mask?

70
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:04,662
It was given --
and understood.

71
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:06,621
Any, uh, luck
ID'ing the victim yet?

72
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,013
Nah, it's too soon.

73
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:09,928
There were fifth-
and sixth-degree burns.

74
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:12,279
But from the size,
I'd say it was a man.

75
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:14,324
And you might want to start
referring to him

76
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:16,718
as a suspect
instead of the victim.

77
00:03:16,761 --> 00:03:18,850
You think our DB
started the fire?

78
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:20,591
That's what
the evidence suggests.

79
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:21,984
He was right
where it started,

80
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:23,768
and an accelerant
was definitely used.

81
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:25,161
No way it could've been
just an addict

82
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,467
falling asleep
next to a lit candle?

83
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,686
No, no, no, no, that fire
got too hot, too fast.

84
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,732
So, what are you thinking?

85
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,255
That the guy
we pulled out of there

86
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,823
might be able
to give us some insight.

87
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:37,347
So, how's the book?

88
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,175
Terrible, but who cares?

89
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,916
It's my third
maternity-leave book.

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,614
I've been lucky to average
one a year up till now.

91
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:45,573
Maybe I should
extend my leave,

92
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:47,444
spend a little more time
with Jack.

93
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:48,793
I think
that's a great idea.

94
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:50,795
Because you don't want me
to go back to work?

95
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,232
Because you want me to quit
being a detective

96
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,711
and focus on
what really matters?
Uh --

97
00:03:53,755 --> 00:03:55,844
Because you think I won't
fulfill my mom potential

98
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,541
if I'm at crime scenes
all day?

99
00:03:57,585 --> 00:03:59,064
Wow.

100
00:03:59,108 --> 00:04:00,152
Where did that
come from?

101
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:01,719
I don't know.

102
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:06,420
Clearly, I'm a little conflicted
about going back to work.

103
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,946
I want you to do
whatever makes you happy.

104
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,513
But I do think
that it's time

105
00:04:12,556 --> 00:04:15,429
to leave the baby home
for a night and go on a date.

106
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:16,865
Who'll watch Jack?

107
00:04:16,908 --> 00:04:18,867
Your mom, my mom,

108
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,391
or some teenager
we pull off the street?

109
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:22,827
Who cares?

110
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:23,915
We deserve
some alone time.

111
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,309
- And some fine dining?
- Hell, yes.

112
00:04:26,353 --> 00:04:27,789
- The fancier, the better.
- I'm in.

113
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:38,408
Client. Um, I have
a meeting I forgot about.

114
00:04:38,452 --> 00:04:41,106
I'll make, uh, reservations
for 7:00, okay?

115
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:45,763
Hey.

116
00:04:45,807 --> 00:04:47,635
I love you.
I love you, too.

117
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:55,164
Hey, how's it going
with Harper?

118
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:58,123
I mean, I'm still here,
so...good, I guess.

119
00:04:58,167 --> 00:05:00,430
She was my training officer.
You're in great hands.

120
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:01,866
Look, I'm just trying to do
whatever I can to keep her

121
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,259
from giving me that look.

122
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, the Triple D?
Yeah, I know it well.

123
00:05:05,043 --> 00:05:08,351
Disappointment,
disbelief, and disdain.

124
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,744
I think she developed it
in a lab somewhere

125
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:11,354
to destroy self-confidence.

126
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:13,661
Yeah, my mom has
a version of it.

127
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:15,793
You think I'd be immune given
how often she's used it on me

128
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,317
over the years.

129
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,057
Yeah, well, Harper uses it
on the daily --

130
00:05:19,101 --> 00:05:20,972
I'm still not used to it.
Hang in there.

131
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:23,758
So, I also need you
to cover C Division today.

132
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,976
Anything else you need?

133
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,630
Paint your house
or clean your car?

134
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:30,939
I got two roving sergeants
for six divisions.

135
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:33,376
Welcome to
your new reality.

136
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,335
That's why you should take on
a sergeant's aide.

137
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:37,946
I don't need an aide.

138
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:40,383
It's not a sign
of weakness.

139
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:43,952
It's a necessity given
how under-resourced we are.

140
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:45,867
Yeah, I guess I could use
a go-fer.

141
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,435
Someone to go-fer coffee
or supplies.

142
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:49,523
Call it whatever you want.

143
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,046
Just pull an officer out
at roll call.

144
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,309
Hell, pull Chen.

145
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,832
You two
work together good.

146
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:59,402
Tim is going to ask you
to be his go-fer.

147
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:00,490
What? His -- His what?

148
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:01,926
His aide.

149
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,580
He's stretched a little thin.

150
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:05,930
Grey suggested
he take you on to assist.

151
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,584
Me specifically?
Yeah.

152
00:06:07,628 --> 00:06:10,326
Uh, is there a problem?

153
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,719
No, ma'am.

154
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:13,155
I'm just excited to hear
what new nicknames

155
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:14,417
you came up with for me.

156
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:15,984
Hm. Uh, I've --

157
00:06:16,027 --> 00:06:17,899
I've narrowed it down
to three.

158
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,902
Um, "Get out of my face"...
Mm-hmm.

159
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:22,773
..."sit your ass down"...Okay.

160
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:25,297
...and "I will tell you
when I am ready."

161
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,693
- I love them all.
- Okay.

162
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:31,434
Triple D.

163
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:34,481
What was that?
Nothing. Just sitting my ass down.

164
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:36,439
So, all right,
settle down, everyone.

165
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:38,702
Sergeant Bradford,
you want to start us off?

166
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:40,356
Yes. Um...

167
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,749
I'm in need of a go-fer.

168
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,185
Now, it won't be glamorous,

169
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:45,230
but it'll be
a learning experience.

170
00:06:47,624 --> 00:06:49,539
Webb, how about it?

171
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,758
You ready
to get off patrol?

172
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,716
Yes, sir.
Looking forward to it.

173
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,109
You said --
I thought --

174
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:56,720
Officer Nolan,
so I saw your request

175
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:57,765
to follow up on the man
you pulled out

176
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,244
- of the fire yesterday.
- Yes, sir.

177
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,203
I checked with the hospital.
He regained consciousness.

178
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,465
Thought it would be important
to get his statement

179
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:03,901
while his memory was fresh.

180
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:04,685
I agree.

181
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:05,773
I'll notify Caradine

182
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,601
for when he assigns
a detective.

183
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:11,039
You're driving today.

184
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:12,475
Hey, you know
I almost qualified to race

185
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,520
in the British
Grand Prix, right?

186
00:07:13,563 --> 00:07:15,522
I mean,
before my troubles.

187
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:17,262
And you've never
known real fear

188
00:07:17,306 --> 00:07:19,351
until you've gone airborne
in a Formula 1 car.

189
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:22,746
Yeah, try being hunted
by a pack of cartel sicarios,

190
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,313
then get back to me.

191
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:26,228
Okay, <i>that's</i> a story
I want to hear.

192
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,534
Nyla.

193
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,971
Hi.

194
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:31,494
What are you
doing here?

195
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,888
Just stopped by
to ask you to lunch.

196
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,890
It's 9:00 A.M.

197
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,631
Oh, right. Sorry.

198
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:38,936
When your kid gets up
before the sun,

199
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,634
you lose track of time.

200
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:43,898
Uh, plus, I was wondering, um,

201
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,291
if you could take care
of this ticket for me.

202
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:49,033
Unh-unh. No.
Put it away. I can't.

203
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:51,601
- I'm gonna go
set up the shop.
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,734
Sorry. I knew
I shouldn't have asked.

205
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:56,606
Yeah, you also shouldn't have
been going 60 in a 30.

206
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:57,868
What were you thinking?

207
00:07:57,912 --> 00:07:59,435
That my ex was gonna
tear me a new one

208
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,350
if I was late
for my pickup again.

209
00:08:01,393 --> 00:08:02,830
That's no excuse.

210
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:05,354
Can I take you
to dinner this week?

211
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:06,529
I'd love that.

212
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:07,791
I would too.

213
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:13,623
Is that your boyfriend?

214
00:08:15,843 --> 00:08:17,540
No, I'm just curious
to know, um,

215
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:20,325
if I gave off any signals

216
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,371
that would make you
comfortable enough... Uh-huh.

217
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:25,200
...to ask me
a personal question.

218
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:27,028
No, the -- um,
there were none.

219
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,682
Mm.
There were
no signals given.

220
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,989
Um, that's what some people
like to call "my bad."

221
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:34,644
Mm-hmm. Get your ass
in the shop, Boot.
Okay.

222
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:36,341
Why would you tell me that
Tim was going to pick me

223
00:08:36,385 --> 00:08:37,647
when he didn't?

224
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,431
- Because Grey told him to.
- Then why didn't he?

225
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,216
I don't know, but clearly,
it bothers you.

226
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:43,218
No, I just --

227
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:45,481
It would make
a good career opportunity.

228
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,048
As a roving supervisor,

229
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:49,093
Tim responds to all
the high-profile cases.

230
00:08:49,137 --> 00:08:50,921
And being
right there with him

231
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,880
would make me stand out
when promotion time comes.

232
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:54,185
So tell him
you want the gig.

233
00:08:54,229 --> 00:08:56,144
Oh, he would
just love that --

234
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:59,147
being in a position
to decide my fate <i>again.</i>

235
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,802
No...he'll come around.

236
00:09:01,845 --> 00:09:03,586
I just have
to give it time.

237
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,762
Because the one thing
I know for sure

238
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:09,461
is that Tim is definitely
missing me right now.

239
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:11,115
I can't believe
the ump made that call --

240
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,334
and in the bottom
of the ninth!

241
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:13,596
It was clearly foul.

242
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,511
B-- I know --
by like three feet!

243
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:16,730
What's the point
of instant replay

244
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:17,905
if you're not gonna
get it right?

245
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:20,342
Hey, man, you're preaching
to the choir.

246
00:09:20,385 --> 00:09:21,822
Hey, you know
I get season tickets

247
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,084
to the Dodgers
and the Angels,

248
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:24,607
so if you ever want
to hit up a game,

249
00:09:24,651 --> 00:09:25,956
just let me know.

250
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,218
- I'll hook you up.
- Oh.

251
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:28,698
Don't say that
if you don't mean it,

252
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,004
'cause I will call.

253
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:32,441
Hey, that's the least
a go-fer could do.

254
00:09:32,484 --> 00:09:34,051
"Aide."

255
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:34,878
My man.

256
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,968
- Hi, there.
Hi.

257
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,666
Mr. Hall,
do you remember us?

258
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,537
We pulled you out
of the fire yesterday.

259
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,191
What were you doing
in the house?

260
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:46,934
Oh, well, uh,
I-I've been squatting there.

261
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:49,327
Yeah, it's a lot safer
than being on the streets.

262
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:51,329
Oh, of course.
How long have you been there?

263
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,070
Since I returned.

264
00:09:53,114 --> 00:09:54,071
From...?

265
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:55,638
Kremulus.

266
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,248
And Kremulus is...?

267
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,903
Oh, it's the planet right next
to Proxima Centauri,

268
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,036
but no one really
knows about it,

269
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,255
so please just keep it
to yourself.

270
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:06,562
Oh, I-I-I think you can
count on us.
Mm-hmm.

271
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,085
Now, w-were you there alone?

272
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,739
Did anybody come back
with you?

273
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,045
No.

274
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:13,482
No, those who walk
a celestial path

275
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,745
are destined for solitude.

276
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,227
But I did hear
some voices yesterday.

277
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,446
Okay, how do I put this?

278
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,840
Were the voices...

279
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:26,147
inside your head,
or were they --

280
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,366
- I-I-In the house.
- Ah.

281
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,107
Two guys.

282
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,457
I-I heard them come in
through the back.

283
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:35,286
I hid so that
they wouldn't see me.

284
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,247
And maybe...
half an hour later,

285
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,814
that's when
the fire started.

286
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:43,947
Did you hear
what the voices were saying?

287
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:46,341
Would you recognize them
if you heard them again?

288
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:47,777
No, they were
pretty muffled.

289
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:50,084
And you're sure it wasn't
just one man?

290
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,868
Yes...

291
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:54,958
because one of them
was yelling...

292
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:58,179
...and the other
was crying.

293
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:05,186
Mr. Stone insisted
on waiting in your office.

294
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:06,622
Of course he did.

295
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,058
He's got a couple
shooters with him.

296
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:09,799
Serious-looking dudes.

297
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,801
Feels like
a "car theft" situation.

298
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:13,760
That's a good idea.

299
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:15,283
All right,
give me two minutes.

300
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:20,680
Hmm.

301
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:24,988
Hey.

302
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:26,468
Counselor.

303
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:31,255
Punctuality is a quality
I expect from all my employees.

304
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:32,779
Well, having a newborn

305
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,259
kind of throws punctuality
out the window.

306
00:11:35,303 --> 00:11:38,132
Need I remind you why
you still have a son to dote on?

307
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:40,177
No, I'm aware
of what I owe you.

308
00:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,484
And yet, you spent
the last month

309
00:11:42,527 --> 00:11:45,313
on paternity leave,
avoiding paying me back,

310
00:11:45,356 --> 00:11:46,880
which makes me think

311
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,751
you're trying to go back
on our deal.

312
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,927
No, not at all.

313
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,886
I just think that
I'm best used

314
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:55,540
in an un-muddied capacity.

315
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:57,064
I have been meaning
to speak to you.

316
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,979
I have a sterling reputation
with law enforcement,

317
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:00,110
but that only benefits you
if I can continue --

318
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:01,546
Shut up.

319
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,899
You seem confused about
the dynamics at play here.

320
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:08,553
You work for me now,
which means what I say goes --

321
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,164
So sorry to interrupt,

322
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:12,732
but someone just tried
to steal my car from out front.

323
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:13,907
The police will be here
in a minute.

324
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,473
Is that so?

325
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:21,088
You know, the only thing
worse than stealing...

326
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,742
in my book...

327
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,091
is lying.

328
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,748
And yet, you lie
and steal for a living.

329
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,316
What can I say?

330
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,883
I'm a walking contradiction.

331
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:41,717
Just think about
what we just spoke on.

332
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,849
It'd be better
for everybody

333
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:45,199
if I didn't have
to say it again.

334
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:57,689
Where are we
right now, Boot?

335
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,561
Uh, San Vicente and --

336
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,128
If you have to look,
you don't know,

337
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:03,217
and trouble is not gonna wait
for you to find a street sign.

338
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,653
Got it. Sorry.

339
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,394
I will do better.

340
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:08,918
You mind
if I take this?

341
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,314
Whatever you think
is best.

342
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,142
Go for Aaron.

343
00:13:15,185 --> 00:13:17,187
<i>Hey, Aaron,
it's Quinn from "TMZ."</i>

344
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:18,580
<i>I really need
to talk to you.</i>

345
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,538
Disguising your number.
Smart.

346
00:13:20,582 --> 00:13:21,931
Look, man, I told you
I'm not interested.

347
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:24,020
An alert just came in.
You should check the box.

348
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,065
<i>I've been calling you
all week, man.</i>

349
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,240
<i>I can never reach you.</i>

350
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:27,589
"Hollywood Division
is running a 246."

351
00:13:27,632 --> 00:13:29,721
<i>Look, hear me out
before you say no, okay?</i>

352
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:31,419
"Drive-by shooting into a..." 
<i>I've got a really sweet
deal for you.</i>

353
00:13:31,462 --> 00:13:34,465
<i>I've got my editor
to up the price to 100 grand.</i>

354
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:36,337
Hey, look, man, I told you
I'm not interested, okay?

355
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,599
Don't call me again.

356
00:13:37,642 --> 00:13:38,948
Uh, did you see the guy
in the trench coat?

357
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:41,124
He might be
concealing a weapon.

358
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,648
<i>7-Adam-19,
clear for traffic?</i>

359
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:45,259
I didn't see a guy
in a trench coat.

360
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:46,913
- Should I turn around?
- Do you think you should
turn around?

361
00:13:46,956 --> 00:13:48,392
I mean, did you see
a weapon?

362
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:49,785
Did I say I saw one?

363
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,743
<i>7-Adam-19?
Security check.</i>

364
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:54,964
What was the drive-by shooting
vehicle Hollywood was working?

365
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:56,444
I-I didn't s--
It came over the radio.

366
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:00,274
Right. Um, I was --

367
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:02,363
I was looking for that guy
possibly concealing a weapon,

368
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:03,930
but I will find him.

369
00:14:03,973 --> 00:14:06,889
Suspect's vehicle is a...

370
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:08,935
<i>All units,
unable to raise 7-Adam-19.</i>

371
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:11,328
<i>Last location near Stoner Park.</i>

372
00:14:11,372 --> 00:14:13,635
<i>7-Adam-100,
copy missing officer?</i>

373
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:15,202
Oh, my God.
An officer's missing?

374
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,768
Two.

375
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:18,292
Two officers are missing.

376
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:19,684
Okay, that's even worse!

377
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:20,947
Should we look for them,

378
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,731
or should we find
this trench-coat guy?

379
00:14:22,774 --> 00:14:25,125
<i>7-Adam-100,
I copy the missing officer.</i>

380
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:27,649
<i>Harper, it's Bradford.
You guys Code 4?</i>

381
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:28,998
Code 4.

382
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,434
What's our call sign?

383
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,307
7-Adam-19.

384
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,571
Ohhhh.

385
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:38,616
- We're the missing officers.
- Mm.

386
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,096
That is embarrassing.

387
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,968
Yes, it is -- for you.

388
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:43,404
I get a free pass
your first week.

389
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:47,016
All of your many failures
are blamed on the Academy.

390
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,758
So, what have you learned?

391
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,108
That taking the wheel
is demanding enough...

392
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:54,371
...and I shouldn't be
adding in

393
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:56,069
personal phone calls
into the mix.

394
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:57,548
Mm.

395
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:01,596
There wasn't an armed man
in a trench coat, was there?

396
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,945
Mm, mnh-mnh.

397
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,777
Hello! Didn't I see you guys
on a milk carton?

398
00:15:10,213 --> 00:15:12,476
I don't get it.

399
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,478
'Cause we were
considered missing.

400
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,829
They used to put pictures of
missing kids on milk cartons.

401
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,962
- Yes, in the '80s.
- Yes, in the '80s.

402
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,529
How did I end up
the punch line?

403
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:23,313
- Oh, excuse me.
- Uh, yeah.

404
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:24,836
Hey, how come
Bradford didn't choose Lucy

405
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,968
to be his go-fer?

406
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:27,535
I don't know,
but she's not being

407
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,450
very adult about it.
Oh.

408
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:32,105
So, how is it
riding with Tim?

409
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:33,628
Oh, it's been great.

410
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:34,672
You know, everyone
always talks about

411
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:35,847
how tough
the Sarge can be,

412
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:37,893
but we've been
having the best time.

413
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,981
Really?

414
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:40,852
That's...awesome.

415
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,899
So, you know, when I was
riding with him,

416
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,728
I learned some foolproof ways
to stay on his good side.

417
00:15:46,771 --> 00:15:48,860
You know, if you -- if --
if you want some tips.

418
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:50,427
Yeah, that'd be great.

419
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:51,776
Appreciate that.

420
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,084
Look out!
Hey!

421
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:00,524
Let me see your hands!

422
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:02,048
- Show me your hands!
Guns down!
- Get out of the car!

423
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,788
Get out of the car!
Let me see your hands!

424
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:06,182
- Put your guns down!
Private security!
We got CCW permits!

425
00:16:06,226 --> 00:16:08,663
Someone just shot our client
through the windshield!

426
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,012
Front seat clear!

427
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,973
Is everybody okay?!

428
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:16,801
Sarge?
Yeah?

429
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,629
I think we got a sniper.

430
00:16:18,673 --> 00:16:20,240
What do you see?

431
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,242
Three shots grouped tight
high on the windshield.

432
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:25,332
Judging from where the car was,
I'd say our sniper is northeast.

433
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,637
Control, 7-Adam-100.

434
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:27,812
We got a shooter
with a long gun

435
00:16:27,856 --> 00:16:29,466
at the 16000 block
of Rochester Avenue.

436
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,207
I need eastbound traffic
from Veteran shut down.

437
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:32,861
Get SWAT en route.

438
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:34,906
Harper, Thorsen,
secure the scene.

439
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,212
Nolan, Chen, Webb,
you're on me.

440
00:16:36,256 --> 00:16:37,561
- Clear the street!
- Move, move!

441
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:39,737
Active shooter!
There's a shooter! Move, move!

442
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:41,565
Get inside! Go!
There's a shooter!

443
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,480
- Get off the street!
- Come on, move!

444
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:48,833
#Looked the devil in the eye 
Hey! Stop right there!

445
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,400
#Taking risks is my design

446
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,054
#Y'all was born
without a spine

447
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:53,316
#Wicked and twisted

448
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,405
#Bars are sicker
than syphilis

449
00:16:55,449 --> 00:16:56,928
#Spit and you listen

450
00:16:56,972 --> 00:17:00,019
#Only way to stop,
I don't breathe again ?

451
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,237
#You wanna come around

452
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,673
#Yeah, see me then

453
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:09,245
7-Adam-15!

454
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:11,334
Taking shots inside
16000 Rochester.

455
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:13,684
Parking garage.
We're going up.

456
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:15,643
Requesting more units
to cover the exits.

457
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:23,477
#Go for broke
while you go for blows 

458
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,305
Get your hands up!

459
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,832
#You wanna come around,
yeah, see me then ?

460
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:37,578
#You wanna come around,
yeah, see me then ?

461
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:48,415
I gotta admit, I'm disappointed
you didn't go after him.

462
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,199
Oh, I was halfway
out the window.

463
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:51,722
Lucy had to pull me back.

464
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:53,594
Mm-hmm.
This guy's a pro, Sarge.

465
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,552
Put three bullets
through tempered glass

466
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:58,294
into a moving vehicle and still
dead-centering his target --

467
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:00,122
only a couple dozen people
in the world who could do that.

468
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,864
The secondary escape route
screams elite training.

469
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:05,301
Someone paid real money
for this guy's services.

470
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:06,998
- You got a name
on the target?
- Michael Silver.

471
00:18:07,042 --> 00:18:08,652
Some kind of
import-export guy.

472
00:18:08,696 --> 00:18:10,393
Hired a security company
a week ago.

473
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:11,960
Didn't tell them why --

474
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:13,266
or, at least,
they're not sharing with us.

475
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,832
Intelligence unit
is running Silver's name

476
00:18:14,876 --> 00:18:16,878
to see if he's in
their database.

477
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:19,054
Well, clearly, he pissed off
some bad people.

478
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,361
Okay, we got an ID
on our arson victim.

479
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:22,536
Nelson Crespo.

480
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:23,885
He's a 35-year-old
restaurant manager,

481
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:25,669
a couple of
minor drug arrests,

482
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:27,236
and he has an apartment
in Culver City

483
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,672
with his wife, Celia.

484
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,457
Sir, we could handle
the death notification.

485
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,936
See if Celia might
shed some light

486
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,330
on what our DB was doing
in that house.

487
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:35,897
All right, go ahead.

488
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,726
I'll have Harper and Thorsen
work the sniper with Bradford.

489
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:40,597
Nyla. Hey.

490
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:41,729
James.

491
00:18:41,772 --> 00:18:42,904
What are you
doing here?

492
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,297
Oh, just picking up
a few things

493
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,602
for the community center.

494
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:48,475
I'd ask the same of you,
but I have a good guess.

495
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:52,305
Yeah, I came for the coffee,
stayed for the sniper.

496
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:55,221
Uh, this is my new rookie,
Officer Aaron --

497
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,483
Thorsen.

498
00:18:56,526 --> 00:18:59,138
Yeah, I-I remember
your case.

499
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,140
Man, I-I'm so sorry for
everything you went through.

500
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:03,054
- Thanks.
- I happen to work with

501
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:05,013
a lot of people who've been
wrongfully incarcerated.

502
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:06,884
It can help to talk
to a therapist.

503
00:19:06,928 --> 00:19:08,321
I have some names
if you need 'em.

504
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:11,280
I appreciate that,
but I already go twice a week.

505
00:19:11,324 --> 00:19:12,716
Good, good.

506
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,457
Well, you are very lucky

507
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:17,765
to have this impressive woman
as your training officer.

508
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:18,983
Don't let her bite
scare you.

509
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:20,202
She got a lot of heart.

510
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,335
Uh, now, why would you
go and tell him that?

511
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:24,467
Just to make your job
that much harder.
Huh.

512
00:19:24,511 --> 00:19:26,991
Uh, we are going out
again soon, right?

513
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:28,297
You know it.

514
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:31,213
All right, okay.

515
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,519
Take care of yourself.

516
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,438
What?
Nothing.

517
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:39,700
Good.

518
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,572
Triple D's got game.

519
00:19:42,616 --> 00:19:44,139
You n--

520
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,097
It doesn't make sense.

521
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:48,056
Nelson went for a jog
to the beach.

522
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:50,145
What was he doing
near Griffith Park?

523
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,494
H-How'd he even get there?

524
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:53,453
There's evidence that
the house he was found in

525
00:19:53,496 --> 00:19:55,194
is a place people go
to use drugs.

526
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,412
No.

527
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:59,720
Nelson was clean --
four years.

528
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:02,766
Addicts relapse, uh, and --
and they lie about it.

529
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,204
I know. I am one.

530
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,206
If my husband
was using again,

531
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,208
I would've seen the signs.

532
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,122
Something happened to him.

533
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:14,952
Promise me you won't
just play "blame the addict."

534
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:18,608
I promise you -- we will
follow this case where it leads.

535
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,872
If you can think
of anything else,

536
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,048
please call us --
day or night.

537
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:26,790
And, again, I am truly sorry
for your loss.

538
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,754
You think
she's in denial?

539
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:35,582
Maybe.

540
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,497
Sure would be nice
to get some clarity.

541
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,934
Well, hopefully,
the autopsy will give us that.

542
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:41,327
All right,
thanks for checking.

543
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,286
Intelligence's saying
that Michael Silver

544
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,853
isn't on their radar.

545
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:47,681
How's that possible?

546
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:49,073
No way a guy
who gets popped

547
00:20:49,117 --> 00:20:50,771
by an elite sniper
is squeaky clean.

548
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:53,817
- He's gotta have some
criminal connection.
- I'm gonna call Records.

549
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:54,862
Maybe they have some
information, some --

550
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,342
No, it's -- it's
a waste of time.

551
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:58,213
I'll call LA CLEAR when
we get back to the station.

552
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,128
Right.

553
00:21:00,171 --> 00:21:03,262
Weird case, huh?

554
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,524
Oh, yeah.

555
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:07,918
I'm good with weird.

556
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:09,355
I'm a Manx.

557
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,140
I'm sorry.

558
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,315
You're -- You're a what?

559
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,664
A Manx.

560
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,536
A Manx cat.

561
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:18,102
That's my feline breed.

562
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,279
My cat personality.

563
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,368
What's your cat
personality, Sarge?

564
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:24,587
Did Chen put you
up to this?

565
00:21:24,631 --> 00:21:25,719
Put me up to what?

566
00:21:28,243 --> 00:21:29,505
Whoa.

567
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:31,028
Oh, what, the smell?

568
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:32,291
Yeah, it smells like
month-old eggs

569
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,075
and maggot meat.

570
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:36,556
I mean, you don't --
you don't have to go in,

571
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:39,341
but this is part
of the job.

572
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:40,864
No, I'm good.
Mm.

573
00:21:40,908 --> 00:21:42,518
- Can I just have a sec?
- Oh, yeah, no.

574
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:44,825
Gather yourself,
because what awaits

575
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:47,871
smells like a septic tank
filled with tumors.

576
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:51,266
Okay...
I see what you're doing.

577
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,486
This is payback for me trying
to get too familiar earlier,

578
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:54,922
but you know what?

579
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:57,446
It's all good.
I can handle it.

580
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,926
I'm just gonna have
to cancel my reservation

581
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:00,275
at Eliza and Elektra
tonight,

582
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,582
because there's no way
I'm eating after this.

583
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,366
Whoa, are you crazy?
You have to book that place

584
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,368
like six months in advance.

585
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:09,110
I dream of eating there.

586
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:11,199
You want the reservation?

587
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:12,331
Seriously?

588
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,507
Yeah, it's yours --

589
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,683
if you stop torturing me?

590
00:22:16,726 --> 00:22:17,771
Deal.

591
00:22:17,814 --> 00:22:19,686
Yeah.

592
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:21,383
I mean,
the only question is,

593
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:23,342
which boy toy
are you taking?

594
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,213
Is it gonna be the speed demon
from this morning,

595
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:27,650
or the upright citizen
from this afternoon?

596
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:30,000
I mean, unless
there's a third choice.

597
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:31,480
No, it's James.

598
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:33,917
It's definitely James.
But he's probably busy.

599
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:36,833
Well, text him
and find out.

600
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,751
All right, fine.

601
00:22:55,025 --> 00:22:56,462
Oh, no.

602
00:22:56,505 --> 00:23:00,204
The vanishing three dots.
That is the worst.

603
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:02,903
He's probably gonna
respond later.

604
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,078
You kn-- Let's get
back to work.

605
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:06,472
Right.

606
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:11,346
Detective.

607
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,304
Nice to see you.

608
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:15,698
Judging by the long sleeves
and queasy demeanor,

609
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:17,265
I'd say you have
a new rookie.

610
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:21,138
Yeah. Dr. Lowell,
meet Officer Thorsen.

611
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:23,532
Of course.
Now I recognize you.

612
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,926
You know, I have to say
that the forensic work

613
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:28,015
in your case 
seemed pretty solid.

614
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:29,712
You're lucky the Parisians
set you free.

615
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:32,149
I'm lucky the appeals court
understood that forensic science

616
00:23:32,193 --> 00:23:34,804
can be as corrupt
as the rest of law enforcement.

617
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:39,156
First autopsy?

618
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,157
Yeah.

619
00:23:40,201 --> 00:23:41,855
Smear this under your nose.

620
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:43,465
It'll help with the smell.

621
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,032
I'm surprised your TO
didn't tell you.

622
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,773
I can't give away
all my secrets

623
00:23:46,816 --> 00:23:49,166
in the first week, Doc.

624
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,039
So, you get anything useful
from the autopsy?

625
00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:55,477
Yeah, I found this
lodged in his T4 vertebra.

626
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,740
Looks like it's from a .223.

627
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:02,223
Yeah, possible 77-grain.

628
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:05,487
Also known as NATO rounds
for their full metal jackets.

629
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:07,533
Yeah, very heavy
and very lethal

630
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:10,013
in a skilled marksman's hands.

631
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:13,800
Yeah, to make a long-distance
shot from a .223 round

632
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:15,454
would require
a specialized weapon,

633
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,368
which would seem
to confirm

634
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,501
that our shooter
had military training.

635
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:21,808
Oh, hey.

636
00:24:21,851 --> 00:24:23,070
Wait a minute.

637
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,941
She gave you the menthol
on your first visit?

638
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:26,421
No, the -- the doc did.

639
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,336
Ah, that makes sense.

640
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:29,859
All right,
he's all yours.

641
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,644
Let's go get you
a ginger ale.

642
00:24:31,687 --> 00:24:33,254
And you're here for...?

643
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:34,298
Uh, Nelson Crespo.

644
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:35,865
Ah, yes.
The burn victim.

645
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:37,519
You know, you keep running
into conflagrations

646
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:38,999
without oxygen masks,

647
00:24:39,042 --> 00:24:40,217
and you'll end up
in one of my drawers.

648
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:41,523
Yeah, we've been told.

649
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:43,830
So, you got anything
on Crespo?

650
00:24:43,873 --> 00:24:46,049
Well, I'm still writing up
my preliminary findings,

651
00:24:46,093 --> 00:24:49,270
but I did see something
unexpected in his x-rays.

652
00:24:49,313 --> 00:24:51,881
He had a transverse fracture
to his left femur

653
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,970
and compound fractures
to his pelvis.

654
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,972
From when the ceiling
fell in on him?

655
00:24:56,016 --> 00:24:59,236
No. Actually, the fractures
were perimortem.

656
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,151
Likely occurred an hour
before his death.

657
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:02,326
That doesn't make
any sense.

658
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,024
He would have been
in agony.

659
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:05,678
Mm. Would explain
why he got caught

660
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:06,679
in the fire he set.

661
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:08,245
Oh, he didn't set it.

662
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:09,943
There was no carbon monoxide
in his blood

663
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:11,553
or soot in his lungs.

664
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,773
Nelson Crespo was dead
before the fire even started.

665
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,867
Hey, hope you and James
like the restaurant.

666
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,129
Well, actually, he, uh --
he never replied,

667
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:25,306
so it looks like I will be
going by myself.

668
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,048
How about invite
the other guy, Alonzo?

669
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:29,658
No.
Trust me.

670
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:31,573
This -- This place
is romantic,

671
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,444
and you're not gonna want
to eat there alone.

672
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,625
- Ooh, Harper.
- Hey.

673
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:40,974
Any leads on the sniper?
No.

674
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:42,584
Uh, detectives are on it.

675
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:44,499
Okay, when you catch him,

676
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,892
ask him where
he gets his gear.

677
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:47,763
What are you gonna do
with a zip line?

678
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:49,722
You know how far it is
to my parking spot.

679
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,942
- Oh -- Angela.
- Ask her about the baby.

680
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:55,641
Hey. How's Jack?

681
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:58,513
You can find out for yourself
if you come over and babysit.

682
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,559
Both our moms bailed.

683
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,082
It's for you.

684
00:26:04,998 --> 00:26:06,390
Thank you so much
for doing this.

685
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:08,305
- Of course.
It's our pleasure.
- Yeah!

686
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:10,743
Where is that
little rascal?

687
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,048
Wesley's
putting him down.

688
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:13,267
Mm.
Aw, look at him.

689
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,573
Aw.

690
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,662
Wait, did you start smoking?

691
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:17,793
You can't smoke
around the baby.

692
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:19,186
Uh, n-- Please.
Come on.

693
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:21,275
I -- No, I-I walked
into a house fire yesterday

694
00:26:21,318 --> 00:26:23,451
instead of waiting
for the fire department...

695
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:25,018
Mm-hmm....which is what
I should have done.

696
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:26,541
Mm-hmm.

697
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,500
It's turning into quite an
interesting case, actually.

698
00:26:29,544 --> 00:26:30,676
At first,
we thought the guy

699
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,242
who started the fire
died in it,

700
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:35,550
but the autopsy shows
he was dead before it started.

701
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,682
Yeah,
with a crushed pelvis.

702
00:26:36,725 --> 00:26:38,422
No one knows
how he got it or where.

703
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:39,728
Any witnesses?

704
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:42,296
A transient with
clear mental-health issues

705
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:43,645
that we pulled out
of the house.

706
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:45,473
He said he heard voices
before the fire started.

707
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,040
Heard voices
or "heard voices"?

708
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:48,781
That's what we said,
but given the condition

709
00:26:48,824 --> 00:26:50,696
our victim was in
before he died,

710
00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:52,611
I think our transient
actually heard our killer.

711
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:53,829
Okay,
baby's asleep.

712
00:26:53,873 --> 00:26:55,222
Let's go before
he realizes we're gone.

713
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:56,223
- Hi.
- Hi.

714
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:57,441
Bye.
Later.

715
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,358
- Don't call us.
- Uh, of course.

716
00:27:01,402 --> 00:27:03,230
All right.

717
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:04,535
So...

718
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,450
...what shall we do first?

719
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:08,583
Order food, or...

720
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:11,281
...make out?

721
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:13,806
Order first and make out
while we wait.

722
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:15,634
See, that's what I like
about you.

723
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,026
You're always thinking.

724
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,288
<i>That's</i> what you like
about me?

725
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:19,725
Well, there's more,
and I could show you,

726
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:20,726
but I'm on a schedule
right now.

727
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:21,814
I have to order dinner.

728
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:24,251
How dare you play
hard-to-get?

729
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:26,122
Ooh, and the sweet corn
fried rice.

730
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,515
Hell, yeah.

731
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:28,995
And, uh, meatballs?

732
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:29,952
Ooh, two orders.

733
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:31,650
And -- Ooh!

734
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:32,868
The beet salad.

735
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,175
Thanks.

736
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,612
This is nice.

737
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,266
This is amazing.

738
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,007
Mm.

739
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,399
- Ahh.
- Mmm.

740
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:44,750
Did you hear Nolan talking
about his murder case?

741
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:48,623
It sounded challenging,
in an interesting way.

742
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,060
Mm-hmm.
What? It does.

743
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,932
Angela, this is our
first date in months.

744
00:27:52,975 --> 00:27:54,803
I know, but what's more fun
than dinner and a murder?

745
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,154
Fine. No murder.

746
00:27:58,198 --> 00:27:59,678
Is that Nyla?

747
00:28:01,157 --> 00:28:03,856
I guess that's why
she couldn't babysit.
Mm-hmm.

748
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,124
Oh, my God.

749
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:15,302
Ooh, I think I'm
a little under-dressed.

750
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:16,869
Nah, man -- it's L.A.

751
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:18,435
I've seen people
wear flip-flops

752
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:19,828
to Michelin-star
restaurants.

753
00:28:19,872 --> 00:28:21,787
No one even blinks.

754
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,397
I'm actually
meeting someone.

755
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,877
Nyla.

756
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,965
Hey.

757
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,662
You know her?

758
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,577
She's my date.

759
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,101
No, she's <i>my</i> date.

760
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:34,234
Uh, actually...

761
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:37,280
y-you are both my dates.

762
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:40,762
Eh, funny story -- um...

763
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:42,111
Oh, no.
She double-booked.

764
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:44,505
You did not respond
to my text.

765
00:28:44,548 --> 00:28:47,116
Yes, I'm pretty sure
that I did.

766
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,117
No.

767
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:49,597
O-Oh. No.
Mm-hmm.

768
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,382
Um...
I guess I never hit "send."

769
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:54,428
Right.
And then
you called me --

770
00:28:54,471 --> 00:28:56,517
your second option.

771
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,302
No, it's okay.
Enough said.

772
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:01,478
- She's all yours.
- N-- Alonzo, wait, I --

773
00:29:01,522 --> 00:29:03,132
You know, I th--
I think I'm gonna go, too.

774
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,047
Really? We can't just s-stay
and have some wine and --

775
00:29:05,091 --> 00:29:06,353
and -- and talk about it?

776
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:07,789
No.

777
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,791
I've -- I've acted like
I'm cool with being

778
00:29:09,835 --> 00:29:10,923
one of two guys
you're dating

779
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:13,839
'cause I like you so much.

780
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:16,015
Well, that and
I thought one day,

781
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:17,799
you might actually
pick me.

782
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,192
James, I --

783
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:21,977
It's just -- It's a little hard
on the ego, so...

784
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,328
Enjoy the rest
of your night.

785
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:29,376
By the way...

786
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:31,204
you look amazing.

787
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:38,037
Uh, that was brutal.

788
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,083
I'm gonna go
invite her to sit with us.

789
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,868
No, wait, wh--
A-Are you crazy?

790
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:44,304
Let her go.
Pretend it didn't happen.

791
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,741
Counselor.

792
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:50,266
What a nice surprise.

793
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:56,229
Yeah. Angela,
this is my client Elijah.

794
00:29:56,272 --> 00:29:59,798
And silent partner
in this fine establishment.

795
00:29:59,841 --> 00:30:01,582
Aren't the meatballs
to die for?

796
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,366
They're great.

797
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,628
Will you excuse me
for a minute?

798
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:06,108
Of course.

799
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,025
What the hell
are you doing?

800
00:30:10,069 --> 00:30:13,507
It is a crime
how easy it is...

801
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,509
...to hack a baby monitor.

802
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:22,733
You're making a mistake,
threatening us.

803
00:30:22,777 --> 00:30:24,997
I don't make threats.
I make promises.

804
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,261
And I always follow through --
just like I expect you to.

805
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:30,829
From this moment on,
whatever line

806
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:32,787
I need you to cross,
you will cross it.

807
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,875
Whoever I tell you
to represent,

808
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,746
you'll take them on
as a client.

809
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,140
And if I need you to betray
their interests in my benefit,

810
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:39,272
you'll do it.

811
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:41,187
I'll get disbarred.

812
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,666
Well,
only if you get caught.

813
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,539
This is what you agreed to trade
for your wife and child.

814
00:30:48,324 --> 00:30:51,937
And you do not want
to default on this debt.

815
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:57,290
Oh, and you gotta order
the pot de crme.

816
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:00,684
It's sinful.

817
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:18,485
- Chen.
- Hmm?

818
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,836
If you want the job,
all you gotta do is ask.

819
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,665
What?
You sabotaged Webb.

820
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:26,493
I don't know what
you're talking about.

821
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:27,798
His cat personality?

822
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:29,931
Well, that's got you
written all over it.

823
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:31,890
Look, if you want me
to ride with you,

824
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,108
you don't need
to make up an excuse.

825
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:34,544
Just ask me.

826
00:31:35,676 --> 00:31:37,112
Good morning.

827
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:38,853
So, we have
a clearer understanding

828
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,116
of yesterday's
sniper shooting.

829
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,988
According to
the Gang Unit,

830
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:45,512
the victim had a falling-out
with Elijah Stone.

831
00:31:45,555 --> 00:31:46,948
So, it <i>was
a contract killing?</i>

832
00:31:46,992 --> 00:31:48,950
Looks like it.

833
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,604
Gangs put together
a list of potential shooters

834
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:52,171
that Elijah might use.

835
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:55,000
We ran it against
military personnel records

836
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:57,176
and came up with
a dozen names.

837
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:59,613
And you guessed it --
detectives want patrol

838
00:31:59,656 --> 00:32:01,006
to do the initial canvass.

839
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:04,052
So...let's get to work.

840
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,185
Oh, oh.
One more thing.

841
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:07,969
Sergeant?

842
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,885
Yeah, um, I've decided
to spread the love

843
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:14,671
and give someone else a chance
to be my go-fer today.

844
00:32:16,543 --> 00:32:18,501
Smitty, you're up.

845
00:32:18,545 --> 00:32:19,981
Seriously?

846
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,548
I'm sorry, you have something
to add, Officer Chen?

847
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:23,115
No.

848
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,594
Sir.

849
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:26,640
All right, that's it.

850
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:27,902
Be safe out there.

851
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:31,123
Sarge.

852
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:34,865
The job doesn't require
any heavy lifting, right?

853
00:32:34,909 --> 00:32:36,867
I've got a tricky back.

854
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:39,000
No. No lifting required.

855
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:40,697
Including the
war bags, right?

856
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:42,221
Yeah, Smitty,
I'll get the bags.

857
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:47,052
How was the restaurant?

858
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:49,445
What happened?

859
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:50,577
They both showed up.

860
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,493
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

861
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:55,451
Yesterday, I was dating
two cute guys,

862
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,714
and today, zero.

863
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,196
Well, it had to end
at some point, right?

864
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,676
I mean, if you cared
about one of them,

865
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:05,374
you would have made
a decision a while ago.

866
00:33:05,418 --> 00:33:07,028
I liked the freedom.

867
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:10,553
It was fun being able
to take it slow.

868
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:11,641
But?

869
00:33:13,687 --> 00:33:15,950
But I just --
I can't get the look

870
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,952
on James' face
out of my head.

871
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:25,438
And who's
our next contestant?

872
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:26,917
Aiden Merritt, 32.

873
00:33:26,961 --> 00:33:28,136
One tour in Afghanistan,

874
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,486
followed by six years
as a private contractor.

875
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:31,879
Any priors?

876
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,533
A couple domestic
complaints in Houston --

877
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:34,447
an ex-girlfriend --
but nothing since

878
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,014
he moved to L.A.

879
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:39,234
Hey.
Aiden Merritt?

880
00:33:39,278 --> 00:33:40,975
Yeah, that's me.

881
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,803
What were you doing
yesterday at noon?

882
00:33:42,846 --> 00:33:44,805
That's an ominous question.

883
00:33:44,848 --> 00:33:47,460
Um, why do you
want to know?

884
00:33:47,503 --> 00:33:49,114
- There was a sniper
shooting yesterday.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

885
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:50,854
No, I did see that
on the news.

886
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:53,335
And because of
my background, uh, yeah,

887
00:33:53,379 --> 00:33:54,728
I get why
you want to see me.

888
00:33:54,771 --> 00:33:56,034
The answer
to your question

889
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,600
actually has some
irony to it, though,

890
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:58,775
because yesterday afternoon,

891
00:33:58,819 --> 00:34:01,126
I was actually at
the Gun Club downtown.

892
00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:02,997
Well, that's good news.
You got any proof of that?

893
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,912
Um... I might, uh --

894
00:34:04,955 --> 00:34:08,089
I might still have a receipt
for some ammo I bought.

895
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,351
I could go look.

896
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:11,788
Mind if we
step inside?

897
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:13,529
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, I do.

898
00:34:13,573 --> 00:34:14,878
But I'll be right back out.

899
00:34:19,579 --> 00:34:20,841
I am getting a vibe.

900
00:34:20,884 --> 00:34:23,713
- You getting a vibe?
- Big-time vibe.

901
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:25,324
Smart about that
alibi, though.

902
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:27,587
Gives him a reason
to be in the vicinity.

903
00:34:30,503 --> 00:34:32,374
Lucy, I'm looking
at a rifle.

904
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:34,376
Then that gives us
probable cause.

905
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:40,121
I told you
to wait outside.

906
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:43,777
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to show us your hands.

907
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,039
Come on, man.
This is a mistake.

908
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,214
I got the receipt
right here.

909
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:47,563
Yes, sir,
and we will get to that,

910
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:48,912
but right now,
my partner asked you

911
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:50,175
to show us your hands.

912
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:53,613
You really don't want me
to do that.

913
00:34:53,656 --> 00:34:55,658
Yes, we do.
Nice and slow.

914
00:34:56,833 --> 00:34:58,139
Okay.

915
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:04,145
I already pulled the pin
in the bedroom.

916
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:05,364
I was planning
to frag your car

917
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:06,843
when you got back in,

918
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,497
split town before
the smoke cleared.

919
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,369
But...yeah.

920
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:12,545
Now you've forced the issue.

921
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:15,069
You didn't survive a tour
just to die like this.

922
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,984
It's better than going
to prison.

923
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:20,074
Now, put down your guns,

924
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,294
or we can all learn
what shrapnel tastes like.

925
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,777
Okay.

926
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:29,779
- Fine. You win.
- What are you doing?

927
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:30,867
You're a better shot
than me.

928
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:31,912
But I'm a little quicker
on my feet.

929
00:35:31,955 --> 00:35:33,174
Nolan.

930
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:34,349
You got a better plan?

931
00:35:34,393 --> 00:35:36,177
What the hell are you two
talking about?

932
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:37,526
The fuse on a grenade

933
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:39,311
takes approximately
four seconds to detonate.

934
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:41,182
He thinks if I shoot you
in the medulla,

935
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:42,966
he'll have enough time
to grab the grenade

936
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:44,316
after you drop it
and throw it outside

937
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:45,447
before it explodes.

938
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:46,970
Nolan --Actually,
I was planning on

939
00:35:47,014 --> 00:35:48,363
kicking it back
into the house.

940
00:35:48,407 --> 00:35:50,452
Where he probably has
more grenades?

941
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:53,499
You're right.
Change of plan.

942
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:14,650
Spoon's still attached.

943
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:16,870
We're good.
Thank you.

944
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:17,914
What? It worked.

945
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,004
7-Adam-15.

946
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:22,092
Requesting backup
and a supervisor

947
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:23,268
on our location.

948
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,444
And the bomb squad.

949
00:36:25,487 --> 00:36:27,141
Please, can you take that
outside while we wait?

950
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,360
That's right.
7-Adam-15.

951
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:29,665
We're also gonna need
a bomb squad.

952
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:35,541
Hello?

953
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:37,499
Where the hell
are all the baby monitors?

954
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:40,676
Um... I threw them out.

955
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,069
What? Why?

956
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:44,114
<i>There was a --
a safety recall.</i>

957
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:45,246
<i>Fire hazard.</i>

958
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,639
We can get new ones.

959
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:47,857
Higher tech.

960
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,903
Okay. Good catch.

961
00:36:52,427 --> 00:36:53,646
Babe, I gotta go.

962
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:56,344
Secretary wasn't
at her desk,

963
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:59,173
so I figured
I'd just pop in.

964
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,436
Yeah, sure.

965
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,959
What can I do for you?

966
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:05,092
I'm loving this
new attitude, Counselor.

967
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,354
It's just the right balance

968
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:09,357
between confidence
and obsequiousness.

969
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:14,232
I need you to deliver this
to your new client.

970
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,105
What new client?

971
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:38,647
I'm Wesley Evers.

972
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,562
- I'll be representing you.
- It's about friggin' time.

973
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:45,263
Give it to me straight.

974
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:47,003
How screwed am I?

975
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:49,658
Well, we'll get to that.

976
00:37:51,399 --> 00:37:52,835
First, I have
something for you.

977
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,926
Ah.

978
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,232
He hesitates.

979
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,756
You must be new to working
with our friend.

980
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,888
Still in that phase

981
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:03,759
where you think
you have free will.

982
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:05,979
Let me guess --
you took an oath

983
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:08,373
to uphold the law,
not break it,

984
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,852
so now you're torn.

985
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:12,159
Do you possibly
aid and abet a crime

986
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:14,422
by giving me whatever's
in that envelope?

987
00:38:14,466 --> 00:38:17,033
I mean, the very act
of passing it to me

988
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,600
is a likely
ethics violation,

989
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:21,211
which could
get you disbarred.

990
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:24,302
And yet...
you wouldn't be here

991
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:25,781
if you had a choice,
would you?

992
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,799
Actually, it's for you.

993
00:38:50,763 --> 00:38:53,505
You're lucky.

994
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:57,160
Fail one of Elijah's tests,
you end up as fertilizer.

995
00:38:57,204 --> 00:39:00,120
So, how do you plan
to get me out of this mess?

996
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,310
How's it going, Sarge?

997
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,965
Fine.

998
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:21,271
How come Smitty's
not doing the paperwork?

999
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,406
He claims to be
allergic to paper.

1000
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,364
Hmm.

1001
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:27,930
It's not funny.

1002
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:30,411
You should have
just asked me.

1003
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:32,413
I was doing you a favor.

1004
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:35,590
Yeah? How? By telling
the entire station
that you would rather

1005
00:39:35,634 --> 00:39:38,245
ride with Smitty than me,
your old boot?

1006
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:41,901
Look, some would see it
as a demotion for you.

1007
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:43,555
You're back with
your training officer.

1008
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:46,558
Others might read...

1009
00:39:46,601 --> 00:39:47,385
...something else into it.

1010
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,951
W-Why?

1011
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:51,432
Because I'm a girl
and you're a boy?

1012
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:52,781
A very handsome boy.

1013
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:54,130
Oh, gag.

1014
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:56,872
Look, I really appreciate
the intention,

1015
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:59,048
but screw what
anyone else thinks.

1016
00:39:59,092 --> 00:40:01,094
Being a sergeant's aide
would --

1017
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:01,877
Go-fer.

1018
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:05,751
<i>...aide</i> would
make me stand out

1019
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:07,230
come promotion time.

1020
00:40:07,274 --> 00:40:09,842
That alone makes it worth
putting up with your Tim tests

1021
00:40:09,885 --> 00:40:12,975
and old-school
code of honor again.

1022
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,763
So, are you saying
you want the job?

1023
00:40:17,806 --> 00:40:20,113
If you're saying
you want me to do it.

1024
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:26,424
What the hell.
Let's do it.

1025
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,208
You get here an hour
before roll call tomorrow

1026
00:40:28,251 --> 00:40:30,515
and I'll get you up to speed
on all the new protocols.

1027
00:40:30,558 --> 00:40:31,777
Will do.

1028
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,344
Thank you.

1029
00:40:34,388 --> 00:40:35,476
You're welcome.

1030
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,260
Good luck
with your paperwork.

1031
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:42,831
James.

1032
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:46,835
What are you
doing here?

1033
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:48,881
Well, Aaron asked me
to come by,

1034
00:40:48,924 --> 00:40:50,448
said he needed
to talk to me.

1035
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:51,753
That was a lie.

1036
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:53,102
I'm straight-up
playing matchmaker.

1037
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:54,408
Boot, I'm --Hold -- Hold on.

1038
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,844
I'm just trying
to do what I can

1039
00:40:55,888 --> 00:40:57,106
to fix the mess
that I caused.

1040
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,021
You were kind to me
yesterday when we met,

1041
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,546
so I feel compelled
to return the favor.

1042
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:03,852
The second that I offered
Detective Harper

1043
00:41:03,896 --> 00:41:06,594
my reservation,
she invited you.

1044
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:08,727
And when
you didn't respond,

1045
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,511
she was gonna go alone.

1046
00:41:10,555 --> 00:41:13,079
But I pushed her
to invite the other guy.

1047
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:16,952
You know how close to the vest
she plays things.

1048
00:41:16,996 --> 00:41:19,172
I could still see
how upset she was

1049
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:20,478
when she saw that
she hurt you.

1050
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:23,045
So, maybe...

1051
00:41:23,089 --> 00:41:25,526
I don't know,
give her a second chance.

1052
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:26,919
I'll see you tomorrow.

1053
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:34,622
That all true?

1054
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:35,971
Yeah.

1055
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:41,107
I'm sorry
I messed everything up.

1056
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:46,808
Okay.

1057
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:50,595
You can take me
to dinner.

1058
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:52,248
I can?
Yes, you can.

1059
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:53,815
Okay.

1060
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:57,427
But if there's anything on
the menu that I need to Google

1061
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:59,995
to figure out what it is,
I'm walking.

1062
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:02,476
- No, you're not
having that.
- I'm -- I'm just --
I'm -- I'm not --

1063
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,130
- Can't do that.
Refuse. Refuse.
- Okay, I-I think I got it.

1064
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:06,872
I've been thinking about
your arson case.

1065
00:42:06,915 --> 00:42:08,700
You kill someone,
you set a fire to cover it up.

1066
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,310
Pretty standard move.

1067
00:42:10,353 --> 00:42:13,356
What's strange
is the broken bones.

1068
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,534
So I ran a search and found
two recent unsolved cases

1069
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:17,926
with similar MO's.

1070
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,319
Both in Nevada,

1071
00:42:19,362 --> 00:42:21,843
both suffered broken legs
before dying in a fire.

1072
00:42:21,887 --> 00:42:24,759
Three murders with
the same twisted MO.

1073
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:26,544
We've got a serial killer
on our hands.
