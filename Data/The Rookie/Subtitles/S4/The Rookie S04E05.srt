1
00:00:08,095 --> 00:00:10,532
Help! Help me!

2
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,058
Oh, my God, Pete.
What happened?

3
00:00:15,102 --> 00:00:17,104
You were the only one
I could call.

4
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:18,235
Okay, stay here.
I'm gonna call 911, alright?

5
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,629
No, no, no.
It's too late.

6
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,848
Will you, please,
just do me a favor?
- Of course.

7
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:26,069
After I die, could you please
roll my ashes up

8
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:27,114
into a blunt...

9
00:00:27,157 --> 00:00:29,333
and smoke me?

10
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:32,075
Oh, you ass!
I almost had a heart attack!

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:33,555
It's jerky.
Happy Halloween.

12
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:35,992
# Whoa, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh #

13
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,691
What?

14
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:42,781
# Like I know
you want me to do #

15
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:45,088
There's something seriously
wrong with you.

16
00:00:45,132 --> 00:00:47,047
You didn't inherit
Dad's love for Halloween?

17
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:48,657
That guy was
the king of pranks.

18
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,485
He loved messing with me
all the time.

19
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:51,877
Yes, my favorite prank
was when

20
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,357
he abandoned me
at the age of 10.

21
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:55,446
Wow. Very dark.
Nice.

22
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,274
So, aside from giving me
a coronary,

23
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:58,667
what are you doing
in town?

24
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,104
Are you kidding? L.A. is lit
during Halloween season.

25
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:02,845
I got five parties
lined up.

26
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:04,107
You didn't bring Chastity?

27
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:06,240
No. She's, uh,
stuck in Tempe.

28
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:09,156
They're doing a haunted house
at the strip club.

29
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:11,114
But I was wondering
if you still have

30
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:13,464
that open-door policy
on your guest room?

31
00:01:13,508 --> 00:01:15,423
A little notice would have been
nice, but, yeah, sure.

32
00:01:15,466 --> 00:01:16,815
How long would you like
to stay?

33
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:19,514
Oh, just a couple days.
Weeks. Months. I don't know.

34
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:22,256
But I do need some clothes.
And deodorant.

35
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,215
And a toothbrush.
Uh, I don't have anything.

36
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,782
Of course not.
W-Why -Why would you?

37
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:28,131

38
00:01:28,175 --> 00:01:30,351
Hmm. Can you grab
the blueberries?

39
00:01:33,354 --> 00:01:35,138
We don't have any.

40
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:37,923
Wha--
I just went shopping.

41
00:01:37,967 --> 00:01:39,186
Hey, when you
finish something,

42
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,752
you need to put it on
the shopping list.

43
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:42,406
I didn't eat them.
I didn't.

44
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,016
Okay. Fine.

45
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,149
Just -Just next time,
put it on the list.

46
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:48,151
Oh, hey, did you figure out
what costume you're gonna wear

47
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:49,544
to the West Hollywood parade
tonight?

48
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:52,677
Um...not yet.

49
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:54,984
I sent you
a ton of suggestions.

50
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:58,335
No offense...
but they all sucked.

51
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,468
Um, o-okay. Well, just because
you say "no offense"

52
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:01,643
doesn't mean
it hurts less.

53
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:06,952
Hello.
Hi.

54
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:08,911
I'm Margaret from 604.
You're a cop, right?

55
00:02:08,954 --> 00:02:10,521
Yeah.
Uh, what's going on?

56
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,349
Hey. Stop!
No, no!

57
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:13,959
Those are delicate instruments!

58
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:14,699
Oh, go screw yourself!

59
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:16,266
Whoa. Police.
Hey.

60
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,876
What's going on?
They robbed me!

61
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,748
Okay, <i>that</i> is not
at all true.

62
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,489
Mrs. Crouch hired us

63
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:23,839
to rid her home
of an aggressive spirit.

64
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:25,449
You mean a ghost?
You guys are ghost hunters?

65
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:28,670
Yeah, we are. The spirit
in Mrs. Crouch's apartment

66
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:30,889
is rather just stubborn,

67
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,761
so we said that
we would do a follow-up.

68
00:02:32,804 --> 00:02:36,199
For another $5,000.
She already paid them $10,000.

69
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:38,941
Our prices are in line
with industry standards.

70
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,204
You didn't get rid of my ghost!
Now, give me my money back!

71
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,510
Okay, here's
what's gonna happen.

72
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:44,860
Mrs.Crouch is gonna stop
trashing your stuff,

73
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:46,818
and you guys are going to
give me your information

74
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:49,430
so I can pass it on
to a detective.

75
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:50,735
Mm-hmm.

76
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:53,912
Hey, what are you 
doing here?

77
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:55,218
I just felt like
swinging by

78
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:56,698
and seeing the best detective
in the city.

79
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,265
You have a client
in lockup?

80
00:02:58,308 --> 00:02:59,657
That too.

81
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:02,269
Well, don't forget to pick up
candy for tonight.

82
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:04,271
And not
those variety packs

83
00:03:04,314 --> 00:03:06,490
with that pathetic,
fun-sized nonsense.

84
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:09,841
We serve full-sized bars
at the Lopez-Evers abode.

85
00:03:09,885 --> 00:03:11,713
Uh, good morning.
Good morning.

86
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,193
Um, I need a favor.
What's up?

87
00:03:13,236 --> 00:03:16,065
My neighbor is being
taken advantage of.

88
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:18,981
There are these, uh,
paranormal expert,

89
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:20,112
ghost hunters,
whatever.

90
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:21,940
They're charging her
10 grand

91
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,464
to rid her apartment
of ghosts.

92
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:25,205
That's ridiculous.

93
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:27,772
10 grand should at least get you
a quality exorcism.

94
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:31,733
That said, making a case
against them could be tricky.

95
00:03:31,776 --> 00:03:35,171
Yeah, tarot, fortune-telling,
necromancy, ghost hunting --

96
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,260
all the psychic arts
are legal in California.

97
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:40,176
But she's an old lady
on a fixed income.

98
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,178
There's no way
she can afford $10,000

99
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,484
on "psychic services."

100
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:45,399
Well, now, that changes
the equation.

101
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,966
Yeah, elder financial fraud
is a crime.

102
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,881
I'll look into it.
Thank you. You're the best.

103
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:52,319
Excuse me.

104
00:03:52,362 --> 00:03:54,625
Hello.
This is Lucy Chen.

105
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,802
Um...confirming
what appointment?

106
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:00,109
Excuse me?

107
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,632
Your mother did what?

108
00:04:01,676 --> 00:04:03,895
She pre-paid for me
to have my eggs frozen

109
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:05,723
at a fertility clinic.

110
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,159
I thought you and your mother
weren't talking.

111
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,900
She's definitely
talking now.

112
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:11,816
Seriously, what makes her think
she has the right?

113
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,606

114
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,782
Alright. Nolan...

115
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:25,569
Can you tell me what today is
and what "ACH" stands for?

116
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:28,833
Today is Halloween, and I have
no idea what "ACH" stands for.

117
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,400
No candy
for partial answers.

118
00:04:30,444 --> 00:04:31,401
Harper?

119
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,315
Anything can happen.

120
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,232
Basically a reminder
to be extra careful

121
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,540
'cause today is Halloween
and Halloween is unpredictable.

122
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,672
Correct.
And since Officer Thorsen

123
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:44,153
has range qualifications today,
you're back riding with Nolan.

124
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:45,589
Oh, just like old times.

125
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,548
Yeah, without the fear of
the whole blue-page thing.

126
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:50,812
Uh, what kind of unpredictable
can we expect today?

127
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:52,727
Good question, Chen.

128
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,425
Lot of liquid courage.
Lot of 211's.

129
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:57,601
Teenagers snatching
little kids' candy.

130
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:59,429
Masked people running into
liquor stores.

131
00:04:59,473 --> 00:05:02,214
Do they have a gun, or are they
just late for a party?

132
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,260
Muzzle discipline
is critical.

133
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,827
And?

134
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:09,439
Can you remind us how you got
your uniform torn

135
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:10,832
three Halloweens ago?

136
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,792
Uh...

137
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:19,623
if you get dispatched
to a loud party,

138
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:22,191
make sure they know
you're not the stripper.

139
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:29,546
We'll try to get you home
on time,

140
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,374
but it's Halloween, so...

141
00:05:31,418 --> 00:05:33,507
Anything can happen.

142
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,160
Exactly.
Alright, be safe out there.

143
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,686
This is nice,
being together again.

144
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,558
It's actually a relief
riding with someone

145
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:43,691
who can handle himself.

146
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:46,215
A compliment?
How far we've come.

147
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:48,173
I am in a good place.

148
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:51,046
You know, work's good,
James is great.

149
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,396
I have a wonderful relationship
with my daughter.

150
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,965
And, I don't know, this job,
it's -it's changed everything.

151
00:05:57,008 --> 00:05:58,401
Nice.

152
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,229
Lila excited
for Halloween?

153
00:06:00,272 --> 00:06:02,362
Oh, beyond.
She's changed her costume

154
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:04,102
like 10 times this week.

155
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:05,887
And how do you
and Donovan arrange

156
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,454
for trick-or-treating?

157
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:10,021
We're supposed to alternate
years, but this morning,

158
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:12,415
Lila told her father and I
that she wanted to do

159
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,200
a family-themed costume,
like we used to wear.

160
00:06:15,244 --> 00:06:17,638
That sounds...
complicated?

161
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:18,987
Yeah.
But, you know,

162
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,423
she has her heart
set on it,

163
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:25,080
and Donovan and I are in
a good place, so we agreed.

164
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:26,342
Hmm.

165
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,083
That's very enlightened
of you.
Thank you.

166
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,824
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

167
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,216
Seriously, why would you
jinx me like that?

168
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,305
Um, I should probably
take this.

169
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:34,350
Go ahead.

170
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,830
Hey, Chastity.
How's it going?

171
00:06:35,873 --> 00:06:37,048
<i>Terrible.
Are -Are you sitting down?</i>

172
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:38,223
<i>It's -It's --
It's about your brother.</i>

173
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,921
<i>He's missing.
Oh, no, he's --</i>

174
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:41,313
<i>He went to the store
last night,</i>

175
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,272
<i>and he went to go get
corn nuts and Fanta,</i>

176
00:06:43,315 --> 00:06:45,013
<i>and -and no one's seen him
since, and I'm just --</i>

177
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:47,668
<i>I'm worried that he may have
fallen off the wagon.</i>

178
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,409
He's -He's on the wagon?

179
00:06:49,452 --> 00:06:50,888
<i>Yes, and I would have called
the Tempe Police,</i>

180
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:52,237
<i>but they're still mad about
the glitter bomb and --</i>

181
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:54,501
Okay, no, no, Chastity,
um, Pete's fine.

182
00:06:54,544 --> 00:06:56,372
He-He's not on a bender
and he's not missing.

183
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,635
He's here in Los Angeles.
He's with me.

184
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,158
<i>That son of a bitch.</i>

185
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,899
O-Okay. You want to tell me
what's going on?

186
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:05,207
<i>What's going on is, I am going
to kill your little brother</i>

187
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,383
<i>the next time I see him,
but before, I'm gonna rupture</i>

188
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,298
<i>his delicate parts
with a pair of stilettos</i>

189
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:12,170
<i>and close up all of his
openings with a hot glue gun.</i>

190
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,911
O-Okay. You --
You do realize you--

191
00:07:13,955 --> 00:07:16,044
you've described about
six crimes to me, right?

192
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:16,784
<i>Ugh.</i>

193
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:20,352
You have to hand it to her --
she's very creative.

194
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:21,266
Mm-hmm.

195
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,226
Happy Halloween.
Be safe out there.

196
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:25,445
Thank you.

197
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:27,882
I'm just saying,
I am only 29.

198
00:07:27,925 --> 00:07:30,319
My eggs are nowhere near
their expiration date.

199
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:32,190
But clearly, my mother thinks
that I'm a pathetic loser

200
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:33,453
who's never gonna find
a partner

201
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:36,238
before her fertility clock
ticks down.

202
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,848
Or she's just looking out
for you,

203
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:39,502
knowing how busy you are.

204
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:41,504
Wha--
Why are you taking her side?

205
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:43,071
I'm not taking her side.

206
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:45,421
It's just --
It's a biological fact

207
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,205
that you have a ticking
reproductive clock.

208
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:48,903
Mm. Don't be smug about
the fact that men

209
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:50,948
can have kids
well into their 90s.

210
00:07:50,992 --> 00:07:53,124
I'm not even 30
and apparently,

211
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,213
I need to flash-freeze
my ovaries.

212
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:57,694
It's just insurance, okay?

213
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:00,741
Look, you don't get
car insurance

214
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,394
hoping that
you crash your car.

215
00:08:02,438 --> 00:08:04,179
The policy is a waste
of money, alright?

216
00:08:04,222 --> 00:08:06,224
If your mom wants to pay
the bill, let her.

217
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,748
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just compare

218
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,793
my fertility
to a car wreck.

219
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,839
I can't find my daughter.
Selina.

220
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,449
She's dressed
like Stitch.

221
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:16,060
Uh, ma'am, she's --
she's right over there.

222
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:17,018
No.

223
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:20,717
There were <i>two</i> kids
dressed as Stitch.

224
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:26,375
Okay. A parent probably
just grabbed the wrong kid.

225
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:29,596
Um, hi. My name is Tim.
What's your name?

226
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,032
Alton.

227
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:33,121
Okay, did your mom or dad
accidentally leave

228
00:08:33,164 --> 00:08:34,296
without you, Alton?

229
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:35,471
My dad.

230
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,603
Okay, and what's
your dad's name?

231
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:37,865
Daddy.

232
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:40,563
Okay, I got this.

233
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:42,826
Hi. Do you know
where you live?

234
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:46,830
Oh, great. You are so smart.
Where?

235
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,049
In a house.

236
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:50,573
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. Okay.

237
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:53,315
This is gonna take a little bit
longer than I thought.

238
00:08:53,358 --> 00:08:54,621
<i>You didn't tell her
I was here, did you?</i>

239
00:08:54,664 --> 00:08:56,971
Yes, of course I did.
She was freaking out.

240
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:58,189
She thought
you'd gone missing.

241
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,322
<i>Are you not aware
of the Bro Code?</i>

242
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,019
<i>'Cause rule number seven
clearly states</i>

243
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:04,456
<i>that when a girlfriend
asks where your bro is,</i>

244
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,024
<i>the answer is always,
"I don't know!"</i>

245
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,896
<i>God, you're the worst
half-brother ever!</i>

246
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:10,637
I was about to say
the same thing.

247
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,029
<i>Oh, good.
So you agree.</i>

248
00:09:12,073 --> 00:09:13,901
I'm the --

249
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,076
Okay.
You -You know what?

250
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,512
I can't -Pete, I got to go.
I got to go.

251
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,948
Control, 7-Adam-15.

252
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:20,429
415 unknown,
Third and Gardner.

253
00:09:20,472 --> 00:09:21,822
People are running.
Stand by.

254
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,040
Get out of there!

255
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,221
Over there!

256
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:39,230
Zombie!

257
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:40,928
Ma'am?

258
00:09:40,971 --> 00:09:42,059
Ma'am, we're here to help.
What's your name?

259
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:45,889
Ma'am, can you hear me?

260
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:52,809
#

261
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:56,421
Ugh!

262
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:05,909
#

263
00:10:05,953 --> 00:10:07,041
You ready for round two?

264
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:08,956
Yeah?

265
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:16,093
#

266
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:19,836
Come on!

267
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:26,713
7-Adam-15,
one in custody.

268
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:29,324
On some kind of 11-3.

269
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,065
She's having a seizure.

270
00:10:40,161 --> 00:10:41,075
You're the ones
who brought her in?

271
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,338
Yeah.
She tried to eat us.

272
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,427
Is -Is she
having a seizure?

273
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,081
Most likely a drug-induced
seizure.

274
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:48,822
Any idea what she took?

275
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:50,737
Given the super strength,
I'd say PCP,

276
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,000
but honestly, I've never seen
anything like this before.

277
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:55,698
It's got to be
some new designer drug.

278
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,221
Ugh. I hate Halloween.

279
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:58,919
I'll reach out when
the tox screen comes back.

280
00:10:58,962 --> 00:10:59,963
Thank you.
Thank you.

281
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,621
Police.

282
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,971
Would I lie to you?
Invest now, buddy.

283
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,538
Get in on the ground floor
and I'll make you rich.

284
00:11:09,581 --> 00:11:10,844
What? I'm busy.

285
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,759
Sir, you're the prime suspect
in a kidnapping.

286
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:16,327
Let me call you back.

287
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:17,502
Did you just
take a child

288
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:18,765
from the Mid-Wilshire
police station?

289
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,288
Yeah.
My son, Alton.

290
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:21,768
Sir, that is not
your son.

291
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,032
<i></i>

292
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:27,034
Hey, Selina?

293
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:29,036
Hey, could you take off
your hood, please?

294
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,298
Hi.

295
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,343
Holy crap.
I swear, I had no idea.

296
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:33,562
Hey, are you okay?

297
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:35,129
More candy.

298
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,957
You can ask your mom.
Let's go.

299
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,916
Noooooooo.
I want to stay here.

300
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,963
My mom doesn't let me
eat sugar.

301
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,797
Hello.
I'm Detective Lopez.

302
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,450
Oh, we are picking up

303
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:55,062
some very strange
readings in here.

304
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,716
Must be the ghosts
of all the con artists

305
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,065
I've sent to prison.

306
00:11:58,108 --> 00:12:00,415
10 grand to pretend
to clean an apartment

307
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,286
full of ghosts
is a good hustle.

308
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,461
It's not a hustle.

309
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,812
Shh.
Just listen.

310
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:07,552
Mrs. Crouch
is on a pension,

311
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:10,077
and you two are draining
what's left of her future.

312
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,382
You have two options --

313
00:12:11,426 --> 00:12:14,777
give her a refund,
or I'll start digging around

314
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,866
and see if there's
a pattern of abuse.

315
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,390
We are not
con artists.

316
00:12:19,434 --> 00:12:22,176
Paranormal phenomena
is real science.

317
00:12:22,219 --> 00:12:25,179
Now, we detected a presence
in Mrs. Crouch's home.

318
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:28,138
We set up infrared thermometers
all over the apartment

319
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:30,358
and recorded
a substantive drop

320
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:32,099
in the ambient temperature
in the bathroom.

321
00:12:32,142 --> 00:12:34,928
A temperature drop which <i>is
evidence of a spectral presence.</i>

322
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,538
Or a draft.

323
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:39,062
And our UV camera
picked up this.

324
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:50,204
There. <i>That</i> is the spirit
we were trying to clear

325
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:51,466
from Mrs. Crouch's home.

326
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:53,816
That's a digital glitch
or your own shadow.

327
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,339
Spoken like
a true innocent.

328
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:57,080
You have to understand
that before it was

329
00:12:57,124 --> 00:13:00,431
some marketing gimmick
to sell candy and costumes,

330
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:03,739
Halloween was <i>the</i> sacred day
when the veil between

331
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:08,091
our world and the next parted
and the spirits moved freely.

332
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:09,963
You misunderstand.

333
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,139
I'm not saying I don't believe
in evil spirits.

334
00:13:12,182 --> 00:13:14,445
I'm saying
I don't believe in <i>you.</i>

335
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,578
Detective...

336
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,667
Mrs. Crouch
is in real danger.

337
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,712
And we need to get back there
to finish the cleanse.

338
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,192
Not happening.

339
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:24,151
I gave you a chance
to do the right thing.

340
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:26,936
You want to do this
the hard way, we'll
do this the hard way.

341
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,242
This will be quick.

342
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,765
As long as I get that free lunch
you promised me,

343
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,201
I am good.

344
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,638
Everything's in the fridge.
Help yourself.

345
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:35,466
Hey.
I love this shirt.

346
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,468
It makes me look like
a lumberjack.

347
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:38,774
Hey, I know you.

348
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,993
Nice to see you again.

349
00:13:41,646 --> 00:13:43,039
What's with
the lecture face?

350
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,954
This isn't lecture face.
I don't have lecture face.

351
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:47,652
That is 100%
a lecture face.

352
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,654
I'm-a make a sandwich.

353
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:50,612
Pete, what's going on
with Chastity?

354
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:52,222
Why are you really here?

355
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,310
So she didn't tell you?

356
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:55,269
No, she hung up on me.
She's pissed.

357
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:57,967
Well, that's because
she's

358
00:13:58,011 --> 00:13:59,403
I'm sorry, she's what?

359
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:01,101
Pren-She's nent.

360
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:02,537
She's fragrant?
She's pregnant.

361
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,060
What?! Pete!

362
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,584
So, you -you walk out
on her and let her believe

363
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:08,282
you've gone missing?

364
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,632
What are you --Oh, so I freaked out.
Relax, okay?

365
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,416
What -What exactly
about this makes you think

366
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,070
that I'll be a good dad,
okay?

367
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:16,768
I-I-I don't floss.
I've never had a vegetable.

368
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:19,162
I-I have the IQ
of a hummingbird,

369
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:21,556
which I'm told they're
the stupidest of the birds.

370
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,993
The biggest favor
I can do for this kid
is to just walk away.

371
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:25,908
You can't be serious.

372
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:28,345
You have a kid, right?
W-Would you let me babysit?

373
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:31,261
Uh, I'd be more likely
to put her in charge of you.

374
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:35,222
See?
So you're gonna do to your baby
what our dad did to me?

375
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:38,268
Yeah, I know Dad left you,
but he stayed for me,

376
00:14:38,312 --> 00:14:39,879
and look how that turned out,
alright?

377
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,055
I just know if
I stick around,

378
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,621
I'm just gonna
screw it up.

379
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:46,233
Sorry to interrupt, but our
zombie suspect is conscious.

380
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,452
Sorry,
did you say "zombie"?

381
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,758
We'll finish this later.

382
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,021
And a hummingbird is
a proud and noble animal.

383
00:14:54,545 --> 00:14:55,982
That poor kid.

384
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,548
Imagine having that idiot
as your father.

385
00:14:57,592 --> 00:14:59,072
Guy was just clueless.

386
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,813
There are a lot worse
out there. Trust me.

387
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:04,991
I'm living proof that some
people should not be parents.

388
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:08,951
You think
you'll ever have kids?

389
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,000
Uh, honestly?

390
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:16,263
I, uh, thought I would've
had some by now.

391
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:18,265
Isabel and I,
we made all these plans --

392
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:20,876
pop out three kids,
watch them grow up,

393
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,312
have kids of their own.

394
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:23,531
But...

395
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:25,446
Things don't always
work out.

396
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:28,449
Which is why you think I should
make contingency plans.

397
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:29,276
Watch out!

398
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:33,715
Control, 7-Adam-100!
Possible 51-50!

399
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,108
Olympic at Citrus.

400
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,937
Male, 30s,
is now attacking my shop.

401
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,939
Get an additional unit
and an RA. Code 3.

402
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,508
Uh, Amber, hi.

403
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:47,555
I'm, uh, Nyla.
This is John.

404
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:50,514
What drug did you take?
Amber?

405
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:53,430
She was speaking earlier --
random words here and there.

406
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,693
It's clear that whatever
this drug is,

407
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:58,435
it has had a catastrophic effect
on her nervous system.

408
00:15:58,479 --> 00:16:01,525
The damage to her brain
might be irreparable.

409
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,092
We should check back
with the tech guys,

410
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:04,876
see if they had any luck
opening Amber's phone.

411
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,574
We need to track down
her dealer.

412
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:11,622
Biter?
Yes.

413
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:12,754
We had one, too.

414
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:14,930
They ID the drug yet?
No.

415
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,410
Guys, honestly,
have you ever seen

416
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,542
anything like
this before?

417
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:24,070
You all okay?
Nothing broken,
nothing bleeding.

418
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:25,506
Yeah,
but plenty is sore.

419
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:28,422
The Intel Unit says
this new drug is called Bomb-X,

420
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,946
and it's being sold on something
called ClipTalk.

421
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,340
That's a new
social media app.

422
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:36,038
Once we figure out which
hashtags are trending,

423
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:37,474
we'll be able to whittle it down
to our dealer.

424
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,476
Until then,
we're just playing catch-up,

425
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,043
and a lot of innocent people
are getting hurt.

426
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,436
What do you
want us to do, Sarge?

427
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,351
Nothing.
I called in extra personnel

428
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,395
for the midnight shift.

429
00:16:45,439 --> 00:16:47,049
I'm going
to brief them now.

430
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,138
You're all end of watch.

431
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:53,490
And what are you doing?
Stay with you.

432
00:16:53,534 --> 00:16:56,058
Sergeant Reeves is covering two
districts on this crazy night.

433
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,320
The least I can do
is help.

434
00:16:57,364 --> 00:16:58,843
Thanks.

435
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,584
It was all a big
misunderstanding.

436
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,760
No. The Edwards
took advantage of you.

437
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:05,502
Uh, no, darling.
I was wrong.

438
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:07,504
My ghost hasn't
made a peep in hours.

439
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:09,289
All that tinkering
they did worked.

440
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:12,161
Or they could have <i>caused
the paranormal activity,</i>

441
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:15,034
in which case, they also
could have made it stop.

442
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,253
Sometimes,
people prey on seniors.

443
00:17:17,297 --> 00:17:19,647
You know what they do
even more often?

444
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,605
Underestimate us.

445
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,216
I'm not an idiot.

446
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,088
No, ma'am. I didn't mean
to suggest that you were.

447
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,003
As soon as strange things
started happening,

448
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,091
I did my research.

449
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,353
Let me tell you,

450
00:17:30,397 --> 00:17:33,052
there's no way this building
isn't...haunted.

451
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:36,229
Dare I ask
what you're in for?

452
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,404
Hi.

453
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:38,840
Pete.

454
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:40,189
I hate you.

455
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:41,451
Okay.

456
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,192
Yeah, you make me think.
I don't like thinking.

457
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:44,759
Yeah, well, thinking sucks,
but sometimes,

458
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,674
that's the price you pay
for being an adult.

459
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:49,633
Yeah, well, you know, I'm not
gonna ghost Chastity, okay?

460
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:53,246
If she wants to have a baby,
then I'll man up, you know,

461
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:54,682
I'll take care
of my family,

462
00:17:54,725 --> 00:17:55,639
but I-I don't know
what I'm doing.

463
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:56,988
I don't have any skills.

464
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,294
Start with what you know.

465
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:00,209
Yeah, but all I know how
to do is, you know, gamble

466
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:01,471
and, like, do drugs,

467
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,994
and, you know,
I don't even do that anymore.

468
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:04,779
Well, let's start with that.
Okay, gambling.

469
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:07,347
Um, you, uh --
you need patience,

470
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:10,959
uh, strategic thinking, uh,

471
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:13,004
uh, optimism,
being able to read people.

472
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:14,310
Your knowledge
of the drug trade.

473
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:16,530
You could...

474
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:17,966
Uh, you...

475
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:19,533
You.

476
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,056
You could help us.

477
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,840
Hey, do you know anything
about buying drugs

478
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:24,277
through ClipTalk?

479
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,888
Yeah.
Only, like, everything.

480
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,890
Really?
Yeah. You, uh --

481
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,283
You want me to help you
get drugs?

482
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,198
I --
I don't think
I could do that.

483
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:34,069
I don't think NA would be
too proud of that.

484
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,723
I -It's not for me,
and I would never do anything

485
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:39,118
to endanger your sobriety.
I just --

486
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:42,033
If you could give us
any insight on Bomb-X,

487
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,818
you could help
a lot of people, Pete.

488
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:45,602
Alright.
Check this out.

489
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,648
It's actually pretty easy
to do.

490
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:48,997
So you just go on here,

491
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,870
and his name
is Flamebroiled6060,

492
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:55,482
which is street slang
for getting lit.

493
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:56,570
Pete.
Yeah?

494
00:18:56,613 --> 00:18:58,180
How'd you like to make
500 bucks?

495
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,529
Can I hold your gun?
No.

496
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:00,487
Please?
Come on.

497
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,836
You never let me
hold the gun.

498
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:04,273
I think your building
is haunted.

499
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:05,666
I did some research,

500
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,408
and while our ghost busters
may be frauds,

501
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:11,062
this place is destined to be
a Netflix documentary.

502
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:12,238
What happened?

503
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:14,109
In 1912, the building
was constructed

504
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,198
as a textile factory.

505
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:19,897
A year later, seven workers
died in a fire.

506
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:22,726
1927, a speakeasy opens
in the basement.

507
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,728
It closes within the year.

508
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:27,209
Employees kept quitting,
driven out by the sounds

509
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:29,864
of people screaming
as they died.

510
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,387
That's awful.

511
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:33,215
The building shuts down during
the Depression,

512
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:35,391
doesn't open again
until the '60s,

513
00:19:35,435 --> 00:19:38,220
when a charming,
young musician

514
00:19:38,264 --> 00:19:40,875
decides to use it
for his recording studio.

515
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:42,703
Brian Wilson?

516
00:19:42,746 --> 00:19:44,095
Charles Manson.
Mnh.

517
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:46,272
In the aughts, the building
was purchased

518
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:49,666
and converted into
the hipster catnip apartments

519
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,102
we see before us.

520
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:53,801
A worker goes missing
during construction.

521
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:56,020
A week later, he's found
in one of the walls,

522
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,457
surrounded by
scratch marks,

523
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,677
as if he tried to
claw his way out.

524
00:20:00,721 --> 00:20:02,592
Okay. Let's move.
I know an underpass

525
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,072
that stays pretty warm
this time of year.

526
00:20:04,115 --> 00:20:05,856
No, we are not moving.

527
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,642
Look, this is all creepy
and just not great,

528
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:11,514
but ghosts aren't real.

529
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,951
The only real problem
are the con artists

530
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:15,910
that are preying on
Mrs. Crouch.

531
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:18,695
She's the one who pointed me
to the building's history.

532
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:21,785
And unfortunately,
she doesn't want our help.

533
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,745
But elder fraud goes way down
when a trusted friend

534
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:27,748
or a family member
or nosy neighbor...

535
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,402
Well......takes an interest.

536
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:33,493
So I'm 99% certain our
ghost hunters won't be back.

537
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:37,888
Man. I hope I have a neighbor
as caring as me

538
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:39,238
when I'm old and alone.

539
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,804
Rough week
on the dating market?

540
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:42,589
It is so much worse
than that.

541
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:45,113
My mother has literally paid

542
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:47,420
to have my eggs
harvested and frozen.

543
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:50,988
I wouldn't laugh
if I were you.

544
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:52,860
Life sneaks up on you fast,

545
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,731
Miss I-just-went-through-puberty.

546
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:57,168
Hey, if she wants to pay
for it, why not?

547
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:58,996
Egg freezing costs
thousands of dollars.

548
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,476
Now you can do it
for free.

549
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,783
The real cost
is my peace of mind

550
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:04,088
every time my mother asks me

551
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,699
when I'm gonna take
her grandkids

552
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:07,266
out of the deep freeze.

553
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,529
So then don't freeze your eggs
and just adopt.

554
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:12,140
It's not like there's
a shortage of kids out
there who need it.

555
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:14,795
Well, I got to get home
for Jack's first Halloween.

556
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:16,710
Call me if you need
recommendations for movers.

557
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:18,102
We're not moving.

558
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:19,365
Uh-huh.

559
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,583
#

560
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:24,457
Oh, hey, look,
it's Mom.

561
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,372
#

562
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:27,503
You're late.

563
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,157
Well, given that
I was just informed

564
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,116
about our family-themed
costume today,

565
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,554
I think I deserve
a little credit.

566
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:37,034
Okay.
But you look super cute,
baby girl.

567
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:38,601
Thanks.

568
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,475
You make a great
Rey Skywalker.

569
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:43,954
Oh. Are you just
saying that

570
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:45,391
because I am
a real-life badass,

571
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:48,524
or because I look good
holding a lightsaber?

572
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:49,743
Uh, both?

573
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,658
Hmm, that was
a good answer.

574
00:21:51,701 --> 00:21:53,442
Hmm, okay.

575
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:54,922
Thanks for coming,
though.

576
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:57,490
And for wearing
the whole costume.

577
00:21:57,533 --> 00:21:58,882
It really means a lot
to her.

578
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:01,407
Well, thanks for the invite.
It means a lot to me.

579
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,582
Nyla, is that you?

580
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,279
Mrs. Dolinsky.

581
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,847
So great to see you two
back together again.

582
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,283
I never liked
that Penelope.

583
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,981
Uh, I'm still dating
Penelope.

584
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:12,896
Yeah, we're --
we're not back together.

585
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,379
We are just reunited to fight
for the Rebel Alliance.

586
00:22:17,423 --> 00:22:19,076
Happy Halloween.

587
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,687
Happy Halloween.
Happy Halloween.

588
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:23,385
This is gonna be
a long night, huh?

589
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:24,604
Yep.

590
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:27,171
Hey, thanks for
coming with me.

591
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,564
I know it's not really
your thing,

592
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,610
and I really appreciate
the company.

593
00:22:30,653 --> 00:22:33,047
I promised myself
I'd try new things.

594
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,006
Or old things, I guess.

595
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,660
You couldn't have picked,
you know,

596
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,009
costumes from <i>
this</i> century?

597
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:41,055
Well, you know,
Bonnie and Clyde are not old,

598
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:43,100
they are iconic.
Mm.

599
00:22:46,713 --> 00:22:49,411
Gosh, why is it
always so cold
in this bathroom?

600
00:22:49,455 --> 00:22:51,195
'Cause like 20 people
died in here.

601
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:52,675
Oh, my gosh.
Don't even --

602
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:56,418
#

603
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:57,593
What --

604
00:22:57,637 --> 00:23:02,859
#

605
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,124
Oh.

606
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:09,866
That's why it's always
so cold in here.

607
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:12,260
Give me a hand.

608
00:23:18,353 --> 00:23:21,704
Whoa, uh, that's...
creepy.

609
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:24,881
You heard the history.

610
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:29,103
This building has been
repurposed and subdivided

611
00:23:29,146 --> 00:23:30,452
so many times,

612
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:32,062
I bet there are little
nooks and crannies

613
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:34,108
all over the place.

614
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:37,067
Okay. You stay here.
I will be right back.

615
00:23:37,111 --> 00:23:38,547
Yeah, like I'm
really gonna let you

616
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:40,549
just climb through the gates
of hell by yourself.

617
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,377
Have you ever seen
a horror movie?

618
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,857
Fine.

619
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,162
You can come.

620
00:23:45,206 --> 00:23:46,773
Yes!

621
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,342
Okay.

622
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:53,257
Okay, stay close.

623
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:55,434
#

624
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:57,305
Oof.

625
00:23:57,348 --> 00:24:01,614
#

626
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,530
Oof.

627
00:24:06,706 --> 00:24:07,881
Watch your step.

628
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:20,371
Tamara:
Someone's been back here.
Mm-hmm.

629
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,506
<i></i>

630
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,681
Uh-oh.

631
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:35,735

632
00:24:42,263 --> 00:24:44,918
Now do you believe I didn't
eat all the blueberries?

633
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:48,443
The ghost who's been living
in our walls did.

634
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,966

635
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,494
So Pete set up a controlled buy
with the Bomb-X dealer.

636
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:56,712
And you know your way
around ClipTalk?

637
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:58,322
Oh, yeah. I used to use it
to get ketamine

638
00:24:58,366 --> 00:24:59,976
and Molly
and shrooms and --

639
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,065
Something you might
not want to admit in
a room full of cops.

640
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:04,764
Uh, I mean alle--
allegedly did...that.

641
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,592
Anyway, who's gonna
actually buy the drugs,

642
00:25:06,635 --> 00:25:08,158
like, in real life?

643
00:25:08,202 --> 00:25:11,118
No offense, but you fit
the profile.

644
00:25:11,161 --> 00:25:12,946
Yeah. Totally.
I get that.

645
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:14,774
I just -Uh, the thing is,
I don't really want to be,

646
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,166
like, touching the drugs,

647
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:17,603
because once I get
my hands on it,

648
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:19,126
I don't think I could trust
myself around it,

649
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,607
'cause I don't really have
great self-restraint.

650
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,391
We'll have eyes on you
the whole time, alright?

651
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:26,002
You'll never have a chance
to use the drugs. I promise.

652
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:28,744
If you're uncomfortable
for any reason,

653
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:30,790
we'll find another way.

654
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:32,531
No, no.
I-I got it.

655
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,794
And you'll -you'll be
looking out for me, right?

656
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:36,796
I'll be looking out
for you.

657
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,232
Thanks for stepping in.

658
00:25:38,275 --> 00:25:40,147
And good luck.

659
00:25:41,714 --> 00:25:44,064
Alright. So you're
gonna get wired up

660
00:25:44,107 --> 00:25:45,587
and go in, take the cash
that we give you,

661
00:25:45,631 --> 00:25:46,719
and buy the Bomb-X.

662
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,459
Here's the important part --

663
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:50,331
Clean him out.
Buy everything.

664
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:51,680
That way, he has to go back
to his supplier.

665
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:53,029
Okay, and then <i>
we</i> follow him.

666
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:54,553
That's when <i>
we</i> follow him.

667
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:56,685
At that point, you are done.
One more thing.

668
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,600
You have to be
strip-searched. Twice.

669
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:01,603
Uh, before and after.
In front of two witnesses.

670
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:03,344
You cops really do like it
freaky, huh?

671
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:05,346
It's so the dealer's defense
team can't claim later

672
00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:07,391
that you had drugs on you
before you made the buy.

673
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:09,132
Alright.
Let's get this over with.

674
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:10,743
Might as well start
with the holes.

675
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,005
Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete, Pete!
Yeah?

676
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,006
Not here.

677
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:14,616
What the --?

678
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,617
No?
Not here.
Not here.

679
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,010
Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry.

680
00:26:18,446 --> 00:26:19,839
Happy Halloween.

681
00:26:19,882 --> 00:26:22,276

682
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,583

683
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,456
She's out.

684
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,458
She did hit a record number
of houses this year.

685
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:33,592
Is she okay under there?

686
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:36,116
Uh, I asked her if she wanted
to take it off, but, uh,

687
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,118
she threatened me
with bodily injury.

688
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,815
Freshen you up?

689
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:41,774
Yeah. Sure.
Why not?

690
00:26:43,384 --> 00:26:45,038
Oh.

691
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:51,522
I am not used to walking miles
in $6 pleather boots.

692
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:55,091
Maybe next year, we can steer
her towards a family

693
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,876
that wears
comfy track suits.

694
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:59,661
Mm.
Like "The Royal Tenenbaums"?

695
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:01,402
Exactly.

696
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:02,577
We used to love that film.

697
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,361
Yeah.

698
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:08,801
You know, I'm sorry
it got awkward today

699
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:11,194
with people thinking
that we were back together.

700
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:15,024
But seeing her so happy
made it worth it.

701
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:19,289
Look, I know that we're
supposed to split holidays,

702
00:27:19,333 --> 00:27:22,249
but she's just growing up
so fast,

703
00:27:22,292 --> 00:27:25,948
and I hate the idea of missing
any more time with her.

704
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:27,950
I know what you mean.

705
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:30,953
Maybe we can
come up with, um...

706
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:32,868
a new schedule.

707
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:34,783
Something a bit more fluid.

708
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:36,829
I'd like that.

709
00:27:36,872 --> 00:27:39,483
To us...
and being more...

710
00:27:39,527 --> 00:27:40,789
fluid.

711
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:44,706
So it's not a ghost.

712
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,969
There is someone
living in our walls.

713
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:48,014
Happy Halloween.

714
00:27:48,057 --> 00:27:50,494
I'm getting major
stalker vibes.

715
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:51,887
Mm.

716
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:56,544
Oh.

717
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:59,590
Yeah.
For Margaret Ward, 604.

718
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:02,681
What was that?

719
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,378
Um, I don't know.

720
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:06,641
I hope it was
the pipes, though.

721
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,471
Okay, um, we're gonna
go check it out.

722
00:28:10,514 --> 00:28:11,385
I'll call it in.

723
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:15,345
Okay.

724
00:28:15,998 --> 00:28:20,437

725
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:22,526
Watch your head.

726
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:34,277

727
00:28:34,321 --> 00:28:36,018
Peepholes.

728
00:28:36,062 --> 00:28:37,019
Eww.

729
00:28:37,063 --> 00:28:37,890
Yeah.

730
00:28:40,022 --> 00:28:42,721
Look, Margaret's doing
laundry on Halloween?

731
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,418
We should invite her
to go out with us.

732
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:46,550
Yeah, right after we warn her
she's being creeped

733
00:28:46,594 --> 00:28:48,030
by a stalker.

734
00:28:57,474 --> 00:28:58,649
Margaret!

735
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:03,089
Margaret!
Look out!

736
00:29:03,132 --> 00:29:04,960
We need
to get in there.

737
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:06,745
There has to be
a door or hatch.

738
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,311
He got in there somehow.

739
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:15,405

740
00:29:15,449 --> 00:29:16,580
You stay here.

741
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:29,985

742
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:33,423
Hey! Police!
Drop the weapon!

743
00:29:36,557 --> 00:29:37,776
No, no, no, no.

744
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:40,169
Come on.
Come on.

745
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:53,356
Yes! Yes!
Yes, yes!

746
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,357
Thank you.

747
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:55,968
Yes, yes!

748
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:02,278
This is
Sergeant Tim Bradford.

749
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,497
Today's date
is October 31st.

750
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,586
We're conducting
a "Buy-Walk" operation,

751
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:08,676
using CI number 081316.

752
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,896
Tonight's buy
targets a narcotic

753
00:30:10,939 --> 00:30:12,985
with the street name
of Bomb-X.

754
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:16,466
After the buy, we will tail
the suspect to his SOS.

755
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,773
<i>You guys, uh -You guys
still hear me over there?</i>

756
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,514
You bet, Pete.
We can still hear you.

757
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:23,996
Alright.
I'm, uh -I'm going in.

758
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,697
Hello?

759
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,526
Do those burgers
come flamebroiled?

760
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:35,224
I know you?
Yeah, we, uh --
we texted a few times.

761
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:37,009
You "eggplant emoji 70"?

762
00:30:37,052 --> 00:30:40,577
Yeah. Uh, "eggplant emoji 69"
was already taken.

763
00:30:40,621 --> 00:30:43,493
Okay. Let me see it.

764
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:45,582
Put the money
in the car.

765
00:30:45,626 --> 00:30:47,541
I'll tell you where it is.
Six pack, right?

766
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:49,804
Yeah, well, what started
as a small get-together

767
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,327
has now turned into
a bigger party.

768
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:53,895
Like, "boat" big,
if you know what I'm saying.

769
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,941
You want a boat?
A full boat?

770
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:57,246
I don't have that much
on me.

771
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,465
Well, how much do you have?

772
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:04,036
I got 80 left.
That's four grand.

773
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,081
You got that kind of cash?

774
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,259
How fast
can you get the rest?

775
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:15,525
That was awesome!

776
00:31:15,569 --> 00:31:17,005
You did great!
Yeah.

777
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:19,878
The -The drugs?

778
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:22,402
Right.

779
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,973
Just looks like
a super-fun time.

780
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:29,844
Yeah. A fun time that
turns you into a zombie

781
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,932
and melts your brain.

782
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,629
Right. Yeah.

783
00:31:32,673 --> 00:31:34,066
Got to say, not bad.

784
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,548
Air Three has the dealer on
the 10 East towards downtown.

785
00:31:38,592 --> 00:31:40,159
We got to go.
Right.

786
00:31:40,202 --> 00:31:42,770
Listen, Pete, um...
great job.

787
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:43,902
I'm really proud of you.

788
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:45,816
Thank you.
Can I have the money now?

789
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,123
I'm serious.
It took guts to do what you did.

790
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,211
No, I know.
I'm serious, too.

791
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,647
Could I please have
the money now?

792
00:31:50,691 --> 00:31:52,345
Okay, Officer Jan will drive you
back to the station.

793
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,477
They'll strip search you again,
make sure you didn't keep any,

794
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:55,739
and they'll pay you.

795
00:31:55,783 --> 00:31:58,133
Great. Normally I'd say,
"Lucky you,"

796
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:59,308
but I was sweating balls
out there.

797
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:00,875
Okay.
Let's go.

798
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,529

799
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:11,494

800
00:32:11,538 --> 00:32:13,409
Control, 7-Adam-100.

801
00:32:13,453 --> 00:32:16,238
Suspect just stopped outside
the Los Angeles Theater.

802
00:32:16,282 --> 00:32:18,197
What's the ETA on Metro?

803
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,635
<i>7-Adam-100, Metro
landing in 15 minutes.</i>

804
00:32:21,678 --> 00:32:23,376
This is ridiculous.

805
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:25,030
We're in the middle of an op
and there's no backup?

806
00:32:25,073 --> 00:32:27,162
It's Halloween.

807
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:28,424
Alright,
so what do we do?

808
00:32:28,468 --> 00:32:31,688
Do we go after him
or wait for backup?

809
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,995
We go after him.
There's other exits
on that building.

810
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:35,475
We can't chance him
getting resupplied

811
00:32:35,518 --> 00:32:36,780
and those drugs
hitting the streets.

812
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:37,694
Right answer.

813
00:32:51,578 --> 00:33:36,710
#

814
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:52,943
#

815
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:54,467
Ready?

816
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,732
#

817
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:31,069
#

818
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,201
Police!
Stay right where you are!

819
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:35,029
Show me your hands!
Now!

820
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,640
Turn around!
Turn around!

821
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:39,947
Interlock your fingers
behind your head.

822
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,996
Sit down.

823
00:34:47,476 --> 00:34:48,521
Sit down.

824
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:54,483
#

825
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:10,282
#

826
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:44,968
#

827
00:35:48,015 --> 00:35:56,241

828
00:36:06,642 --> 00:36:08,122
You okay?

829
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,341
Ask me later.

830
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:13,345
Control, we need an RA
to our location.

831
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:14,737
Three suspects in custody.

832
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:16,565

833
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:25,661
Mm.

834
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:28,229
Mm.

835
00:36:33,713 --> 00:36:35,497
Oh, my God.
Ah.

836
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:37,717
How much did we drink
last night?

837
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,153
I don't remember.

838
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,807
Mm. So too much.

839
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,591
Daddy?

840
00:36:42,635 --> 00:36:45,333
Don't -Don't come in.
Uh, I'm getting dressed.

841
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:47,335
Can I have pancakes
for breakfast?

842
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:48,423
And syrup?

843
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:50,251
And can I have some more
of my candy?

844
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,558
Whatever you want,
sweetheart.

845
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:59,521
I-I-I-I don't want to
confuse her.

846
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:02,916
Yeah.
Or get her hopes up
that we are back together.

847
00:37:02,959 --> 00:37:04,657
No.

848
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,093
So what do we do?

849
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:09,183
Uh, you -you go make
her pancakes.

850
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,534
I will do what
any mature single parent does

851
00:37:12,578 --> 00:37:14,406
and hide in the closet.

852
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:15,711
#

853
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:17,365
Did you get any sleep?

854
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:20,238
Considering we went to bed
an hour ago, no.

855
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:24,372
Look, last night was something
out of a nightmare,

856
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:27,114
and if you're not feeling safe
being here right now,

857
00:37:27,157 --> 00:37:29,508
we can get a hotel
or something.

858
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:32,424
I've slept in a lot
of creepy places.

859
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:35,296
Never had a badass superhero
protecting me,

860
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,385
so this is the safest
I've ever felt.

861
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,952
Aww.

862
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:41,998
Oh.

863
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:42,999
Hey!

864
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:44,523
Hey.

865
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:46,960
I just wanted to let you know
that if you hear any noises,

866
00:37:47,003 --> 00:37:50,529
it's TID processing the scene,
not ghosts.

867
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:53,532
Yes. Because ghosts
do not exist.

868
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:56,012
Agree to disagree.

869
00:37:56,056 --> 00:37:58,450
So, uh, did you decide what
to do about your eggs?

870
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:02,715
Uh, I-I'm gonna make an
appointment for a consultation.

871
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:03,672
And then we'll see.

872
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:05,283
Sounds like a solid plan.

873
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:07,241
And the fact that babies
are crying machines

874
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,025
who never sleep for more
than three hours in a row

875
00:38:09,069 --> 00:38:11,767
and you can't tell whether
they're smiling or have gas

876
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:15,031
and every time you change
their diaper, they pee on you.

877
00:38:15,075 --> 00:38:17,686
Don't let any of that
dissuade you

878
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,558
from the joys of motherhood,
okay?

879
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:22,604
Well, when you put it that way,
I mean, I...

880
00:38:22,648 --> 00:38:23,475
I can't wait.

881
00:38:23,518 --> 00:38:24,737
Me either.

882
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,565
Kidding.

883
00:38:26,608 --> 00:38:28,654
I don't want to have a kid for
at least, like, another year.

884
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:32,614
Again, kidding.
God, you're so easy.

885
00:38:32,658 --> 00:38:36,226
Seriously, though, Jack is
the best thing in my life.

886
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,359
And I wish the same for you,
whenever you're ready.

887
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:40,361
Thanks.

888
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:41,971
I know you were just kidding,
but, um,

889
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:44,278
we should probably talk about
birth control, and --

890
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,412
and -and --
and just general sex education

891
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:48,500
would be good.

892
00:38:48,543 --> 00:38:50,371
I'd rather be
possessed.

893
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:51,764
Take it back.

894
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:52,721
It was a joke.

895
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:54,201
Take it back.

896
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:56,029
Fine.
I-I take it back.

897
00:38:57,465 --> 00:38:58,988
Thank God.

898
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:00,903

899
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:03,036
I fed her pancakes,
candy bars, and soda.

900
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,430
I'm a terrible father, but she
won't be coming in here.

901
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:07,867
Thank you for the shirt.
I will get it back to you later.

902
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,695
Of course.

903
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:11,914
#

904
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,046
I bought a ring.

905
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:17,311
Excuse me?
An engagement ring.

906
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,792
Donovan, last night
was fun and all,

907
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:21,489
but we really shouldn't --

908
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:24,013
For Penelope.

909
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:27,365
I was...
planning to propose.

910
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:30,629
And you still should.

911
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,848
I mean, Penelope is great,

912
00:39:32,892 --> 00:39:35,373
despite what
Mrs. Dolinsky thinks.

913
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:38,071
And she is really sweet
with Lila.

914
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:39,420
What about last night?

915
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:43,250
We fell into
a comfortable routine.

916
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:46,471
And now we both
have to move on.

917
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:51,040
Hey, look, we messed up, but
that will never happen again,

918
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,695
which means it's in the past,

919
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:56,872
so let's not let it blow
up our futures, okay?

920
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,657
Yeah. Okay.

921
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,659
#

922
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:03,357
So...

923
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,924
you...

924
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,404
you're going out
the window?

925
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:07,535
Yeah.

926
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:12,148
#

927
00:40:12,192 --> 00:40:14,455
Well, I am all packed.

928
00:40:16,022 --> 00:40:18,328
You didn't even bring
a toothbrush.

929
00:40:18,372 --> 00:40:20,418
Are you just taking
a bunch of my clothes?

930
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:21,419
No.

931
00:40:21,462 --> 00:40:23,203

932
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:26,902
Hey, man, uh,
thanks for, like, uh,

933
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:28,643
you know, all your help
in making me a CI.

934
00:40:28,687 --> 00:40:30,253
That was really cool.

935
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:31,907
I didn't know you could make
money buying drugs.

936
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:33,474
Yeah, yeah.
Even so,

937
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:36,390
I might skip listing that
under "skills" on your rsum.

938
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,871
Hey, uh, not to get
all sappy and crap,

939
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:41,482
but, uh,
thanks for believing in me.

940
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:44,442
Uh, I kinda believe in myself
now a little bit,

941
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:47,357
and I've decided I'm gonna be
a responsible adult

942
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:51,100
and go back to Tempe
and fix things up with Chastity.

943
00:40:51,144 --> 00:40:53,451
And I'll be the dad
that, you know,

944
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:54,669
our dad could never be.

945
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:56,149
Pete, I have no doubt.

946
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,458

947
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:01,546
I see you!

948
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:03,286
I'll get that.

949
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,334
We're wild and free

950
00:41:07,377 --> 00:41:09,205
Thank you.
There he is.

951
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:10,772
Pete, listen to me --

952
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,861
Hey.
Just hear me out, okay?

953
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:14,515
I have a whole speech
prepared,

954
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,908
and it's not gonna
be that great,

955
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:17,213
so please don't get mad,

956
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:18,911
but I-I don't have
a lot to offer.

957
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:20,608
But you already know that
because you know me.

958
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:22,044
Pete --
No.

959
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:23,524
Please --
Please just
let me finish.

960
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:24,656
Okay.

961
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:25,961

962
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:27,789
Chastity Evelyn Sneed,

963
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,487
I want to be
your baby daddy.

964
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:31,097
I do.

965
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,013
I want to be the best dad
that I can be for our child.

966
00:41:34,056 --> 00:41:35,188
So will you please --

967
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:37,669
Stop talking.

968
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:40,367
I'm not pregnant.

969
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:41,890
Wait, what? Seriously?

970
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,544
Seriously.

971
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:47,548
Yes! Oh, my God!
That is fantastic news.

972
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:50,116
Whew.
Wait, I'm actually --

973
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:51,683
I might be a little sad.

974
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:53,685

975
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:56,601
Nah. Not even a little.
I feel great!

976
00:41:56,644 --> 00:41:57,863
We should celebrate.

977
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,168
You want to go to Vegas
or something?
Yes!

978
00:41:59,212 --> 00:42:00,474
I'm -I'm sorry.

979
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,345
Pete,
you just finished saying

980
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:04,260
you wanted to start being
a responsible adult.

981
00:42:04,304 --> 00:42:05,914
Yes. Yes.
That was New Pete.

982
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:06,915
But I'm Old Pete.

983
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:08,264
Old Pete is back

984
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:10,223
'cause new Pete
is no longer required.

985
00:42:10,266 --> 00:42:12,660
And Old Pete
wants to go to Vegas

986
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:14,227
and go to a strip club
and make it rain.

987
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,663
What do you think?
Should we go?
Yeah.

988
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:16,925
Cool.

989
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,884
Bye, John.

990
00:42:18,927 --> 00:42:20,929
Good luck, Chastity.
Thanks!

991
00:42:20,973 --> 00:42:22,148
Later, nerd.
Thanks for having me.

992
00:42:22,191 --> 00:42:24,280
I'll see you soon.
Maybe no rush on that.

993
00:42:24,324 --> 00:42:25,673
No, I-I will be back.

994
00:42:25,717 --> 00:42:27,545
Call first?
Nope!
