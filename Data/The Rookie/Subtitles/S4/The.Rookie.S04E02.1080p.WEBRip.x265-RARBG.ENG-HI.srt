1047
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:58,238
No. It's -- It's fine.

1048
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,414
I-I just wanted to make sure
it wasn't something I did.

1049
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,677
It's not you.
I-I know that's a cliché,

1050
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:03,809
but I-I really mean it.

1051
00:41:03,852 --> 00:41:05,941
You're -- You're great.

1052
00:41:05,985 --> 00:41:08,814
You're funny and handsome.

1053
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:10,555
Warm. Smart.

1054
00:41:10,598 --> 00:41:12,687
Confused.

1055
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:15,298
It's just --
I'm good at a lotta things.

1056
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:18,040
But I am terrible
at relationships.

1057
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:20,347
And they all go
the same way.

1058
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,262
We'll start dating.
You'll open up.

1059
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:23,698
I'll distract you
with jokes

1060
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:25,744
so you don't notice
that I'm keeping you away,

1061
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:27,223
until you get tired
of my bull

1062
00:41:27,267 --> 00:41:29,095
and you tell me
this one-sided relationship

1063
00:41:29,138 --> 00:41:30,879
isn't working
and I'll tell you,

1064
00:41:30,923 --> 00:41:33,665
"Well, this is who I am,
take it or leave it."

1065
00:41:33,708 --> 00:41:35,275
And you'll leave it.

1066
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:38,234
So, you know,
I thought I'd skip to the end.

1067
00:41:38,278 --> 00:41:40,410
Wow.

1068
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:41,586
That sounds like a lot.

1069
00:41:41,629 --> 00:41:43,588
Well, that's me.
I'm a lot.

1070
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:45,285
Yeah, thing is,
I-I'm not believing it.

1071
00:41:45,328 --> 00:41:47,156
I mean, that you're bad
at relationships --

1072
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,071
totally believable.

1073
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:51,291
By your own admission,
you've never --

1074
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:53,859
never actually been in one.
Which is fine.

1075
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:57,906
But I am standing here as living
proof that people can change.

1076
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,430
Who you were
up until this very moment

1077
00:42:00,474 --> 00:42:03,216
is not who you have to be
moving forward.

1078
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:05,871
So, really,
the question here is:

1079
00:42:05,914 --> 00:42:08,700
Do I make you want to show up
differently?

1080
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:13,835
And...so that you know,
if you say that I do...

1081
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:15,358
I'm all in.

1082
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,317
Well...

1083
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,449
when you put it that way.
