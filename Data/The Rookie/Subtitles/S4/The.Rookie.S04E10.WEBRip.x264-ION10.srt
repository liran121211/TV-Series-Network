1
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:08,007
Previously on "The Rookie"...
Your dad is a hell of a guy.

2
00:00:08,051 --> 00:00:10,009
Maybe... you and I could
grab dinner sometime.

3
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:10,923
That'd be great.

4
00:00:10,967 --> 00:00:12,490
Mm. I bet your lovely wife

5
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:14,362
is out there listening, too,
isn't she?

6
00:00:14,404 --> 00:00:15,512
I'm gonna report your husband

7
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:17,016
to the California state bar.

8
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,713
I'm gonna have
his law license revoked

9
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,411
for betraying the trust
of a client.

10
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,041
Lucy: Oh, my God.
Are you going to propose?

11
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:23,327
I'm in love with you.

12
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,001
Thank God. 'Cause I'm
in love with you, too.

13
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,765
Bailey.Jason.

14
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:28,265
I'm John Nolan, her boyfriend.
And you are?

15
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:29,855
Uh, her husband.

16
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,862
Uh, you mean ex-husband.

17
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:39,125
Uh, I do not.

18
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,692
Long time, babe. I guess
she didn't mention me, huh?

19
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:43,801
I mean, I get it. You know,
it's... it's embarrassing.

20
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:46,655
A husband in prison.

21
00:00:46,698 --> 00:00:48,222
Bailey?

22
00:00:48,265 --> 00:00:49,764
You're weren't supposed to
get out for another two years.

23
00:00:49,787 --> 00:00:52,139
Good behavior. I-I can
hardly believe it myself.

24
00:00:52,182 --> 00:00:55,402
Oh. Look. Uh, clearly
I'm interrupting here.

25
00:00:55,445 --> 00:00:58,057
Um, I'm sorry. I didn't realize
you were seeing someone.

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,710
Uh, it's nice to meet you, John.

27
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:01,191
You, uh, be good to her, huh?

28
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:03,889
My wife deserves the best.

29
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:05,194
It's good to see you.

30
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:07,936
Sorry.

31
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:19,861
So you're married.

32
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:25,650
And you didn't tell me.

33
00:01:25,694 --> 00:01:27,304
I-I have to go.

34
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:28,957
Bailey.

35
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:32,177
Bailey.

36
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:49,325
Smells great. Salmon?

37
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,587
And eggs.

38
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:52,850
I'm not really
a breakfast person.

39
00:01:52,895 --> 00:01:55,897
I know. It's for Kojo.
Excuse me.

40
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:58,335
Salmon and eggs. For your dog.

41
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:00,555
Well, not everyday.
I have to watch his cholesterol.

42
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,167
Oh!

43
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,820
There he is! Who's a good dog?

44
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:07,257
Who's the bestdog?

45
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,104
Tricia will be here at 11:00
to give you a walk.

46
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:10,564
Ready to go?

47
00:02:11,826 --> 00:02:14,090
Whoa! Hey! Kojo, knock it off.

48
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:17,223
He's just a little territorial
around his food.

49
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,963
How long have you had him? A year.

50
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,748
He was Lucy's,
but she couldn't keep him.

51
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:26,188
Kojo! Unh-unh!

52
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,582
Voice: Armed stay. Exit now.

53
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:32,543
Kojo! Hey, hey, hey!

54
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,066
I am... I'm sorry.

55
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,067
Look, it's your first time
sleeping over,

56
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:38,069
and he's just not
used to you being here.

57
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:41,073
Here. Why don't you
just put your hand out?

58
00:02:41,116 --> 00:02:43,685
It's okay.
The alarm is about to set.

59
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:45,903
We can do it another day.

60
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:47,471
Sure.

61
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:50,518
Hey. Be good. Alright?

62
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:53,912
Nolan: Why didn't Bailey
just tell me?

63
00:02:53,956 --> 00:02:57,088
I mean, if it's complicated,
just say so. I'll understand.

64
00:02:57,133 --> 00:02:59,439
Is it because of the ex-con
thing and I'm a cop?

65
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:02,399
Who doesn't have a criminal
in their family?

66
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,247
It does not get much more
embarrassing than Pete.
Mm.

67
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,316
And I'm... Oh, I'm spinning out.
I-I'm gonna stop.

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,013
Well, of course
you're spinning out.

69
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:09,937
I mean, she's been lying to you
this whole time.

70
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:12,103
And technically I didn't ask
if she was married.

71
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:14,150
Yeah, but she knows
you were serious about her.

72
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,259
Every day that she did not
tell you about her husband

73
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:18,414
is a day that she lied to you.

74
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:20,287
Do you know whyhe was in jail?

75
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:23,158
No. No clue.Alright.

76
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,248
Call my skip tracer,
have him run this Jason guy.

77
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:28,120
You got a lot of questions.

78
00:03:28,163 --> 00:03:29,948
You need to start
getting answers.

79
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:32,144
Randy: Skip tracer Randy! That's
me! What can I do you for?

80
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:35,258
Whoa. Hey, Randy.
It's, uh, John Nolan.

81
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:36,912
I need you to run a name for me.

82
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:38,628
When's Wesley gonna hear back
from the state bar?

83
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:42,526
Ugh. Any day now. He hasn't
slept the last few nights.

84
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,701
What happened?

85
00:03:44,746 --> 00:03:46,225
They suspended my license.

86
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:47,748
I can't practice law
for six months.

87
00:03:47,792 --> 00:03:50,098
No. That's insane!

88
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:51,317
You were under duress.

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,598
They have to take that
into account.

90
00:03:52,622 --> 00:03:54,103
Can you appeal it?

91
00:03:54,146 --> 00:03:55,211
Look. It won't make
a difference.

92
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,713
I broke client confidentiality.

93
00:03:56,758 --> 00:03:59,151
The state bar takes that
very seriously.

94
00:03:59,194 --> 00:04:01,283
I-It's not even about
the suspension itself.

95
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,286
I'm on a list now of lawyers
who have embezzled

96
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,853
from their clients,
taken bribes.

97
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:07,048
For the rest of my career,
whenever somebody looks me up,

98
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,986
they'll see that
I have been censured.

99
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:10,205
I'm sorry.

100
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,426
Yeah.

101
00:04:15,819 --> 00:04:17,822
Alright. Thanks.
I'll be in touch.

102
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:19,432
What did his parole officer say?

103
00:04:19,475 --> 00:04:21,826
Same thing...
He got out on good behavior.

104
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,827
Unless he violates parole,
he's a free man.

105
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,675
- And you don't believe it?
- Oh, I believe it.

106
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,266
I'm sure he was charming,

107
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,007
knew all the guards' birthdays,
asked after their kids,

108
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:32,183
made everyone handcrafted gifts
at Christmas.

109
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:33,795
Ah, he sounds... awful?

110
00:04:33,838 --> 00:04:35,622
It's all roses
and trips to Paris

111
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:38,625
until you dare disagree
with him, and then...

112
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:40,105
This is how it was.

113
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:42,237
I would try and tell people
who he really was...

114
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,894
They guy they never saw...
And I'd sound insane.

115
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,764
Okay. Well, you know,
it's all behind you now.

116
00:04:47,808 --> 00:04:50,420
You got to focus on the future.
First up, get that divorce.

117
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:52,682
I tried! For two years!

118
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,119
He would go along with it,

119
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,295
pretending to engage
in the negotiations,

120
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,471
and then he'd cut off contact
for months.

121
00:04:58,514 --> 00:04:59,995
And just when I had given up,

122
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:01,494
he would come back
with some new demand,

123
00:05:01,517 --> 00:05:03,476
and we would start this process
all over again.

124
00:05:06,392 --> 00:05:08,177
Fraud alert?

125
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,572
Someone just charged $2,000
on my credit card.

126
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:15,009
It's Jason.

127
00:05:15,052 --> 00:05:16,533
Or it's more likely
that some rando

128
00:05:16,576 --> 00:05:18,100
cloned your card,
don't you think?

129
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:21,233
No. No. I-I-I-I-I don't...
I don't know. Maybe...

130
00:05:21,276 --> 00:05:24,235
Hey. Hey! Do not spin out.

131
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,283
You go into shock inside of
a burning building, people die.

132
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:30,807
Right now your house
is a little on fire.

133
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:33,375
So focus up. What's your plan?

134
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,293
Okay. Uh... call Jason
to the station.

135
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,122
My turf, surrounded
by my friends.

136
00:05:40,165 --> 00:05:42,471
Show him that
I'm not afraid anymore.

137
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:43,821
Tell him I want a divorce.

138
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,999
So, how's it going with Ashley?

139
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:50,827
Good. Although there was
some weirdness this morning.

140
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:52,526
I don't think she likes Kojo.

141
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:53,875
So you broke up with her?

142
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,745
That's... That's too bad.
I liked her.

143
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,792
Since when? Last time
we talked about her,

144
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,204
you gave me grief
because she's a lifeguard.

145
00:05:59,228 --> 00:06:01,360
Okay. Look.
I've never really considered

146
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:02,709
lifeguarding a career.

147
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,122
Okay. You see,
and that is what's called

148
00:06:04,146 --> 00:06:05,495
"Baywatch" -based implicit bias.

149
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:07,322
What?! Ashley went through

150
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,726
rigorous training at the fire
academy to become a lifeguard.

151
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,762
Okay. My bad. But you know what?
It is a moot point

152
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,983
because she doesn't like Kojo,
first of his name,

153
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:17,507
king of canines,
destroyer of chew toys.

154
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,466
So, clearly,
Ashley has got to go.

155
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:24,035
Check out Mister Dollar Sign.

156
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,211
Hand-to-hand transfer.
Classic 11532.

157
00:06:29,997 --> 00:06:31,694
Hey. You are way too young

158
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:33,369
to be throwing your life away
dealing drugs.

159
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,045
Show me your hands. Hey. No!

160
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,699
Hey! Stop! Control, 7-Adam-100.

161
00:06:36,744 --> 00:06:38,875
We got a foot pursuit
southbound, Citrus at Olympic.

162
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,617
Black male. Green pants.
Black hoodie.

163
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:42,358
Hey! Get back here!

164
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:44,683
Put your hands behind your head.

165
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:46,317
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

166
00:06:49,103 --> 00:06:50,845
Control...

167
00:06:53,369 --> 00:06:55,066
What the hell?

168
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,329
7-Adam-100. We've got
a possible Code 1000.

169
00:06:57,372 --> 00:06:58,766
Repeat... Code 1000.

170
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:00,649
Single-engine fixed wing
in distress, headed...

171
00:07:03,987 --> 00:07:05,773
Ohh. 7-Adam-15.

172
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:09,819
A plane is down. 1200 block of
Langston. Send fire and RAs.

173
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,321
You take the car.

174
00:07:32,363 --> 00:07:33,713
Yeah.

175
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,463
- Hey.
- Get me out of here, please.

176
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,021
Get me out of here. Just relax. Relax.

177
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:39,545
Right now I just
need you to breathe.

178
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:41,112
What's your name? Jade.

179
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:42,896
Okay, Jade.
Help is on the way, alright?

180
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:44,985
Bailey, this is Jade.
Bailey's gonna help you out.

181
00:07:45,028 --> 00:07:47,204
She's one of the best. Bailey: Okay.

182
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:48,966
We're gonna get you out of there
in no time, Jade.

183
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,904
Tell me... are you
having trouble breathing? No.

184
00:07:50,947 --> 00:07:52,601
Did you hit your head
when you crashed?

185
00:07:52,646 --> 00:07:55,518
- I think so.
- Okay. Come on.

186
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,005
What's the situation?

187
00:08:05,048 --> 00:08:06,636
Harper: We're still assessing.
The driver got the worst of it.

188
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,009
The flipped cars were empty.

189
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:10,053
- And the pilot?
- I don't know.

190
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:21,848
There's no pilot.
Explains why it crashed.

191
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:25,939
Man: Control, this is Air 7.

192
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,569
We're on scene at that
fixed-wing code 1000.

193
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:30,858
Requesting restricted air space
with half-a-mile perimeter.

194
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,096
Whoever was flying this plane
must've left prints.

195
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,340
I will dust and run them
on my Mobile ID.

196
00:08:42,043 --> 00:08:44,219
Uh... guys?

197
00:08:44,261 --> 00:08:45,480
There's gold back here.

198
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,091
Like a couple dozen
Fort Knox-size bars.

199
00:08:49,789 --> 00:08:51,225
And it gets weirder.

200
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:54,054
The fingerprints I just pulled
match a Levi Lincoln,

201
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:55,970
who is currently an inmate

202
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:58,538
at the California
Correctional Facility.

203
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:01,149
So an escaped convict
stole a plane

204
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:02,778
and crashed it in the middle
of Mid-Wilshire?

205
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:04,543
Don't forget
the 200 pounds of gold.

206
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,197
I'll call the warden.

207
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,721
Levi Lincoln? Why does
that name sound familiar?

208
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:10,288
Oh, wait!

209
00:09:10,331 --> 00:09:13,596
Uh... Uh, that millionaire
who killed his wife.

210
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,859
Yeah, that narrows it down
less than you'd think.

211
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,469
Nolan: No. Uh, no.
I remember. Yeah.

212
00:09:17,513 --> 00:09:20,428
It was a particularly brutal
murder, but Levi's lawyer

213
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:22,014
got the charges knocked down
to manslaughter.

214
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:24,215
Yeah, looks like
he only got 10 years.

215
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:25,565
This makes no sense.

216
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,870
How does an inmate at
a maximum security prison

217
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:30,351
break out with a plane
full of gold?

218
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:33,311
He didn't. The prison says
Levi Lincoln's still there.

219
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,618
Why are his prints in the plane?

220
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:36,966
Harper, Nolan, go to the prison.

221
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,205
Find out what the hell's
going on.

222
00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:39,709
Right.

223
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,584
Uh, give me a minute?

224
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,236
Yeah.

225
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,763
Woman: Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

226
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:51,591
I know you're angry with me.

227
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,854
Oh, I haven't really
gotten to angry yet.

228
00:09:53,897 --> 00:09:55,202
I think I'm still in shock.

229
00:09:55,245 --> 00:09:57,073
I am so sorry.

230
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,727
I... It was
a nightmare marriage.

231
00:09:58,772 --> 00:10:00,947
I tried to divorce him,
but Jason fought me on it.

232
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,384
Then he got arrested
and went to prison...
Bailey.

233
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:06,126
I was so tired of fighting him
that I just walked away.

234
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:09,346
Bailey, stop. I'm not angry
because you're married.

235
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:13,307
I'm... I mean, yes, I am.
Of course I am.

236
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,962
I'm just more upset that
you didn't trust me enough

237
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:18,008
to be honest about
something this important.

238
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:19,226
Mnh.

239
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,967
And I just don't...

240
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,838
know how to move forward
from this.

241
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:27,626
I got... I got to go.

242
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:37,375
You got to give him time.
I mean, he just found out.

243
00:10:37,418 --> 00:10:40,378
I know.
But I can't lose him over this.

244
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:41,640
Bailey.

245
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:45,948
Uh, thanks for reaching out.

246
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:47,690
Look, we are not
reconnecting here.

247
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,299
I want a divorce.

248
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:51,040
I get that you're pissed at me,
alright?

249
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:52,956
And you... you deserve to be.
But listen.

250
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,263
Ever since I got out,
I-I've been trying to find you

251
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:59,005
so that I could apologize
for the man that I was.

252
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:00,746
And could I...
Could I buy you lunch

253
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:02,879
and we could talk about it? No, Jason.

254
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:05,576
We're talking here, because
this is where I feel safe.

255
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,970
Of course. Yeah.

256
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:09,494
Oh. Hi.

257
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,626
Uh, I'm... I'm Jason.

258
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,196
Also known as the worst husband
in recorded history.

259
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:17,677
I'm Sharon. It's nice to meet you.

260
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,375
So, what are you doing
here i-in L.A.?

261
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:21,811
What do you want?

262
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:25,249
For you to be happy. Um...

263
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:29,731
What's that?

264
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:31,341
Divorce papers.

265
00:11:31,385 --> 00:11:33,649
I'm sorry. I was so stubborn.

266
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,738
I-I thought that I could
make you love me again.

267
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:38,871
But I, uh, ruined
everything, didn't I?

268
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:44,485
Anyway, uh, legally,
'cause I'm your spouse,

269
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:46,488
I-I can't hand these
to you directly.

270
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,577
So, uh, Sharon,
if you would be so kind.

271
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,755
Um... I'll see you around.

272
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:58,934
Well, he's giving you
everything you want.

273
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,898
Wes.

274
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:07,726
James. Hey.
What are you doing here?

275
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,903
Ugh. A kid I mentor
just got arrested.

276
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:13,514
Hey, uh, maybe you
could represent him.

277
00:12:15,255 --> 00:12:17,258
Look, I-I wish I could,

278
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,607
but my license just
got suspended for six months

279
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,261
because of
the Elijah Stone thing.

280
00:12:21,304 --> 00:12:23,220
That's tough, man.
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.

281
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:24,351
Thanks.

282
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:26,528
So... So what are you gonna do?

283
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:29,618
Well, right now I'm debating
which bar to get drunk at.

284
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:31,446
Well, you should not
do that alone.

285
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,640
Text me when you decide, and
I'll come meet you after this.

286
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:35,101
Hm.

287
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:37,799
Hey, I-I heard what happened.
I'm so sorry.

288
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,409
I appreciate that.

289
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:41,325
I'll text you.

290
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,283
So, where's Tyler?

291
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:45,241
Processing.

292
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,003
I couldn't get ahold of
his mother, so when he said

293
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:49,289
he knew you, I-I-I thought
it was worth a shot.

294
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:51,335
Yeah. Tyler's in
a bad situation at home.

295
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:53,467
His father's incarcerated,
and his mother...

296
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,644
she has problems of her own.

297
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:56,818
So you caught him dealing?

298
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,821
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

299
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:05,261
What the hell was he thinking?

300
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:07,134
You know, I have a little bit
of leeway here.

301
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:09,222
I can cite him on a JCR,
which would mean

302
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:12,269
he would go home today
until his court date.

303
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:14,532
That would be huge. I mean, I...

304
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:16,186
I just started working
with this kid.

305
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,361
He's... He's veering
close to the edge,

306
00:13:18,405 --> 00:13:22,496
but if we lose him to the system
now, he's lost forever.

307
00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:25,456
Okay. Yeah. I'll cite him out.

308
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,371
I hate this prison.

309
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,200
Are there prisons you don'thate?

310
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,419
All the ones
I haven't almost died in.

311
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:34,552
At least we're not here
to see Oscar.
Why? Why?

312
00:13:34,596 --> 00:13:35,989
Why do you always jinx us?

313
00:13:36,032 --> 00:13:38,120
I-It's like a compulsion
with you.

314
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:39,774
I...

315
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,125
Levi Lincoln.
I am Detective Harper.

316
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:44,823
This is Officer Nolan.
We have some questions for you.

317
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,346
About what?

318
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:50,350
Have you ever flown a Cessna,
tail number N97741?

319
00:13:50,394 --> 00:13:53,484
How the hell would I know?
I own a lot of planes.

320
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:56,009
Okay, well, this particular
plane crashed this morning

321
00:13:56,052 --> 00:13:57,836
with your fingerprints inside.

322
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,838
Well, that's impossible.

323
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,405
You got that right. You've been
incarcerated for 36 months,

324
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,408
and those fingerprints
are fresh.

325
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:05,801
So what the hell?

326
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,585
I mean, that sounds
like a "you" problem.

327
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,936
No, no. I think... I think
something funny is going on.

328
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,850
- I think it's him.
- I agree.

329
00:14:11,894 --> 00:14:14,157
Um, what is your wife's name?

330
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,288
Linda...

331
00:14:18,292 --> 00:14:19,509
I'm not married.

332
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,166
And I need to see a lawyer.

333
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,187
Sir, you're a federal inmate,
and I have every right

334
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:27,213
to inspect your person, so...

335
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:36,265
Plastic-surgery scars.

336
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:40,400
How much did Levi Lincoln
pay you to do his time?

337
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:41,923
$5 million up front

338
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:44,100
and $5 million upon
the completion of his sentence.

339
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:46,624
Oh, you... you should've held
out for more. The guy's loaded.

340
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:50,323
Prisoners are fingerprinted
upon arrival, so someone here

341
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:53,066
had to have helped you and Levi
pull this off. Who was it?

342
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,371
If I tell you that,
I'll be dead by sundown.

343
00:14:55,415 --> 00:14:57,336
I'm not saying another thing
till I see a lawyer.

344
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,909
You think the guards
were in on it?

345
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,639
Or the warden. Or both.

346
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:04,773
You know who would know...

347
00:15:04,816 --> 00:15:06,470
Oh, absolutely not.

348
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,908
This is his prison.
He's been helpful in the past.

349
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:10,952
This is because you jinxed us.

350
00:15:19,134 --> 00:15:21,615
It's my favorite
law-enforcement officers!

351
00:15:21,658 --> 00:15:23,748
Wait. Don't tell me.
I have a son.

352
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:24,966
I always wanted a boy.

353
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,273
This isn't about you.

354
00:15:26,316 --> 00:15:28,100
Oh, you're seeing
other criminals. I'm hurt.

355
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:29,711
What the hell happened to you?

356
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,950
Well, it turns out that you
snitch on one lifer too many,

357
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,235
everybody turns on you.

358
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,413
It's like junior high school
all over again.

359
00:15:36,456 --> 00:15:39,981
Oscar, are you familiar with
an inmate named Levi Lincoln?

360
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:43,245
I am, and I know some
rather shocking things

361
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:46,162
about Mr. Lincoln,
but it'll cost you.

362
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,400
He's paying a double to serve
his time for him. We know.

363
00:15:48,424 --> 00:15:51,037
What we don't know
is who helped him.

364
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,561
Well, I'll tell you
everything I know...

365
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,998
but you have to get me
out of this prison.

366
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,782
- Forget it.
- Given who I've pissed off,

367
00:15:57,826 --> 00:16:00,654
I'm looking at spending
the rest of my life here,

368
00:16:00,697 --> 00:16:02,787
in protective custody, alone,

369
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:05,789
with no one to talk to
but myself.

370
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:08,357
I am concerned for my sanity.

371
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:10,490
So you want a prison transfer.

372
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:13,014
A letter of support from a cop
would go a long way.

373
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:14,755
Fine. I'll write a letter.

374
00:16:14,798 --> 00:16:17,192
Oh, that is so sweet,
but weren't you arrested

375
00:16:17,236 --> 00:16:19,020
for trying to murder
another police officer?

376
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,067
I was exonerated! You know that!

377
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,328
I know, but still.

378
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,851
Detective Harper?

379
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:25,201
Sure. Where do I send it?

380
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:29,639
I know you know because...

381
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:33,121
Hello?

382
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:34,994
Randy: Hey!
It's skip tracer Randy!

383
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,472
Randy, I know
you're a skip tracer.

384
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,084
You don't have to tell me
every time.

385
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:40,129
You never know.
People are forgetful.

386
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:41,672
Did you get any information
on Jason Wyler?

387
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,044
Yes, sir, I did.

388
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:44,828
Born in Chicago, 1984.

389
00:16:44,873 --> 00:16:47,484
Married Bailey Nune, 2016.

390
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,442
Convicted of embezzlement, 2019.

391
00:16:49,485 --> 00:16:52,010
He served two and a half years
of a six-year sentence

392
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,274
at Lompoc and was paroled
last week.

393
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:56,537
That's it? No other arrests
or complaints against him?

394
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,711
I gave you all I've got.

395
00:16:57,754 --> 00:16:58,994
I'll invoice you
for my services.

396
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,105
Randy out!

397
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,414
Who's Jason Wyler? None of your business.

398
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,330
I can help you a lot more
than "skip tracer Randy."

399
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:11,203
You want the real scoop
on this Jason character...

400
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,075
come holla at your boy.

401
00:17:13,118 --> 00:17:17,339
"Oscar Hutchinson has
provided limited assistance

402
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:19,080
to the LAPD on several cases."

403
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:20,299
Oh, that's sweet.

404
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:21,910
Now, which prison personnel

405
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:25,000
did Levi pay
to pull off this switch?

406
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,089
The warden. And four guards...

407
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:31,441
Morrison, Clark,
Hobson, and Lane.

408
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,789
Thank you.

409
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:37,925
Oh, and, uh, I faxed this to
our station, not your lawyer.

410
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,190
That's just mean!

411
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,800
The guy in jail is a fake.
Levi paid him to do his time.

412
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:45,715
Well, we got several
911 calls about a man

413
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,413
parachuting near Echo Park,

414
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:48,607
but he was gone by the time
the police got there.

415
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:50,068
Any idea where he went?

416
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,785
No. We're pulling footage,
but no hits yet.

417
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:53,375
I tracked the Cessna's
flight path.

418
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,769
It took off from Sonoma,
home to, among other things,

419
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:57,989
one of Levi's many estates.

420
00:17:58,032 --> 00:18:00,229
Local police checked it out,
found the back yard dug up.

421
00:18:00,252 --> 00:18:02,690
That's where he got
the gold bars.

422
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:04,909
So he hires someone
to do his time,

423
00:18:04,952 --> 00:18:07,520
heads south of the border,
finds an out-of-the-way place

424
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:08,957
where no one will recognize him.

425
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,847
But he runs out of money,
and he knows he has gold

426
00:18:10,872 --> 00:18:13,134
stashed at the Sonoma house.

427
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:15,156
And he knows he can't board
a commercial flight, so he flies

428
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:17,661
the Cessna, has engine trouble,
and here we are.

429
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:19,923
The rich.
They live just like us.

430
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:21,925
So you're Levi. Where to next?

431
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,059
Well, he still needs money.

432
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,714
So if he hid gold bricks
in his vacation home,

433
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,717
what are we gonna find
in his mansion in L.A.?

434
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,372
Check it out. On it.

435
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,853
Tim: Police. Open up.

436
00:18:37,507 --> 00:18:39,029
Can I help you?

437
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,616
We're looking for
the homeowner, Mr. Lincoln.

438
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:42,163
Mr. Lincoln's in prison.

439
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,644
I'm taking care of his house
while he's away.

440
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:47,256
Man in distance:
Hurry up! Hurry up!

441
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:52,173
Is... Is he here?

442
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:55,176
Back yard. He's got Alfredo.

443
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,353
Ma'am, come here.

444
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:58,615
Step outside.

445
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:04,708
Man: Let's go. Come on.

446
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:08,233
Dig! Faster! Let's go, idiot!

447
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:10,192
Hurry up!

448
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:13,239
Come on! Get the damn bag out.

449
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:15,109
Come on. Faster!

450
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,553
7-Adam-100. Shots fired
at our location.

451
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:24,945
Send backup and airship.

452
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:41,441
Control, 7-Adam-100.
Suspect is escaping

453
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:43,877
on a black motorcycle,
headed east on Acorn.

454
00:19:45,923 --> 00:19:48,203
Levi got away, but we know
he's still desperate for money.

455
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:50,338
We've compiled a list
of all of his acquaintances

456
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:52,278
and potential money sources
across L.A...

457
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,645
Anywhere he might
possibly show up.

458
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,257
We should put a unit on
everyone. Squeeze him out.

459
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,065
Alright. Send me that list.

460
00:19:57,107 --> 00:19:58,806
I'll use it to brief
the midnight shift.

461
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:00,154
I'm sorry. Uh, excuse me.

462
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,329
Hello?

463
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:03,244
Lucy, it's Ashley McGrady.

464
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:05,508
We met at my father's
retirement party.

465
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:06,856
Is this a good time?

466
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:09,556
Uh, yeah. Hey. What's going on?

467
00:20:09,598 --> 00:20:10,817
I have a problem.

468
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:14,647
I like Tim. A lot.

469
00:20:14,691 --> 00:20:17,651
But his dog makes me
super nervous,

470
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:19,913
and I-I know he was yours first.

471
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:22,263
So... why did you give him away?

472
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:24,266
Was he too aggressive?

473
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:26,702
No! Not at all.
I-I mean, my living situation

474
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:29,096
just wasn't suited
to having a pet.

475
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,925
Uh, but Kojo
is the sweetest guy.

476
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,929
I mean, do you...
Do you not like dogs?

477
00:20:34,971 --> 00:20:38,019
I had a bad experience
when I was a kid.

478
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:39,673
I-I totally get it.

479
00:20:39,715 --> 00:20:42,893
Listen. Think about it this way.
Kojo is just like...

480
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:45,330
Well, I-I mean, he's
kind of just like Tim.

481
00:20:45,374 --> 00:20:48,289
He's big, gruff, a whole lot
of bark, but, you know,

482
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:51,205
underneath all of it,
he's a... he's a sweetheart.

483
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,252
You know, you should, um, you
should tell Tim how you feel.

484
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,342
No way. Never ask a man
to choose

485
00:20:56,384 --> 00:20:58,647
between his dog
and his girlfriend.

486
00:20:58,692 --> 00:21:01,259
There's a whole genre of country
songs that warn about that.

487
00:21:02,347 --> 00:21:04,393
- Anyway, I'm sorry to vent.
- No.

488
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:06,221
I'll let you
go back to your night.

489
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,353
Thank you.

490
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:08,701
Oh. Oh.

491
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:10,007
Are you Officer Chen?

492
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,661
Uh, yeah, I am. Hi.

493
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,532
Chris Sanford, DA's office.

494
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:17,057
Did you cite out a drug dealer
named Tyler Stent earlier today?

495
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:18,493
Yes. I did.

496
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:21,105
But Tyler is a juvenile
on his first defense,

497
00:21:21,148 --> 00:21:22,909
so I wouldn't just label him
a "drug dealer."

498
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:24,892
I know. Your arrest report

499
00:21:24,934 --> 00:21:27,328
detailed his tale of woe
at length.

500
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:29,263
Honestly, it's a good thing
this isn't going to trial.

501
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,221
You pretty much just handed
the defense their case.

502
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:32,726
I handed them the truth.

503
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:34,162
You're not really that naive.

504
00:21:34,204 --> 00:21:35,684
No, I'm not.

505
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,121
I'm trying to protect this city.

506
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:38,992
And because of you,
a criminal who was selling

507
00:21:39,036 --> 00:21:41,299
dangerous substances
is back on our streets.

508
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:43,911
Really? So you think putting
a 16-year-old into juvie

509
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:45,346
for a nonviolent offense

510
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:47,435
is gonna turn the tide
in the war on drugs?

511
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,046
Nowwho's being naive?

512
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:50,917
How long have you been
on the job, Chris?

513
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:53,573
Four months.

514
00:21:53,615 --> 00:21:55,138
Mm. But that's not relevant.

515
00:21:55,182 --> 00:21:57,619
Okay. So, tell you what. Let's
give it a year and a half,

516
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:59,336
and then you can come
and criticize my work.

517
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:01,363
Alright?
Nice to meet you, Chris.

518
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:07,020
- Good night. Get some sleep.
- Thanks.

519
00:22:07,064 --> 00:22:08,631
Get home safe.

520
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:24,691
Perfect.

521
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:26,997
Just what I need.

522
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:05,426
Hello?

523
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,646
I'm sorry for reaching out.
I just...

524
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,038
I didn't know who else to call.

525
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:11,780
You alright?

526
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:14,958
Yeah. I'm fine.
It's just been... a day.

527
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,025
I know I'm the last person
you want to hear from right now,

528
00:23:19,048 --> 00:23:21,050
but I feel like

529
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:24,315
if you and I just sat down,
I could explain.

530
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:32,453
I really hope that's true,
but, um...

531
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,455
I can't do it tonight.

532
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,391
I just need a little time
to get on top of how I feel.

533
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,287
You, um...

534
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:40,548
broke my heart a little.

535
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,028
I know.

536
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:44,204
I would do anything
to take it back.

537
00:23:49,905 --> 00:23:52,518
I'll call you.

538
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,138
Hey, guys.

539
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:06,836
Your husband cannot
hold his liquor.

540
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,838
Uh, I am fine.
Don't listen to him.

541
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,188
Is James staying over
for dinner?

542
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:12,451
Oh! We're gonna get pizza.

543
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,234
Mm. Ah, and...
And some garlic knots.

544
00:24:14,278 --> 00:24:16,498
Yes. And garlic knots!

545
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:19,021
Yep, yep, yep.

546
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:21,763
So, what are you
gonna do with yourself

547
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:23,592
for the next six months?

548
00:24:23,635 --> 00:24:26,726
I don't know.
S-Spend more time with Jack.

549
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,162
Maybe get rid of the nanny.

550
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:29,423
Over your dead body.

551
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,859
Okay.

552
00:24:30,903 --> 00:24:33,036
Well, I could
always use your help

553
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,603
over at the community center.

554
00:24:34,646 --> 00:24:37,519
I mean, people come in with
legal questions all the time.

555
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:39,302
Just yesterday, a lady came in,

556
00:24:39,346 --> 00:24:42,219
didn't know whether her sister
should take a plea deal.

557
00:24:42,262 --> 00:24:44,787
Oh, man. Do not get me started
on plea deals...

558
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,222
How they
disproportionately affect

559
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:47,330
people in marginalized
communities.

560
00:24:47,355 --> 00:24:48,790
Yes. Exactly!

561
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,618
I know. Exactly.

562
00:24:50,663 --> 00:24:53,622
What's up?

563
00:24:53,665 --> 00:24:55,450
Lopez: Your boyfriend
is at my house.

564
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,885
What?

565
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,845
Yeah. He and Wesley went out
drinking together.

566
00:24:58,887 --> 00:25:00,715
See? That... That's
what I'm saying!

567
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:02,780
- I know! A hundred percent!
- That's what I'm saying!

568
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,459
Are they watching a game?

569
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:06,721
Mm, no.
Fixing the judicial system.

570
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:08,375
Luckily, Jack is at my mom's.

571
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:10,135
We're ordering some pizzas.
Want to come over?

572
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,683
On my way.

573
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:13,468
Lucy: Tim! Hold up a second.

574
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,383
Hey, did something
come in on Levi?

575
00:25:15,425 --> 00:25:19,605
Uh, no. Uh, you know
that call I took earlier?

576
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:22,085
It was... It was Ashley.

577
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:23,869
Why is my girlfriend
calling you?

578
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:26,175
She wanted to know
if Kojo was a dangerous dog,

579
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,178
'cause you told her
he used to be mine.

580
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:30,223
Okay. That's ridiculous.

581
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:32,617
I mean, he growled at her
a few times,

582
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:33,855
but he's just
getting used to her.

583
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,055
I-It's not a big deal.

584
00:25:35,097 --> 00:25:37,186
W... It is to her.

585
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,059
And you're so concerned
about my love life because?

586
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:42,255
Because I don't want to drive
around on patrol with you

587
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:44,630
while you are moping
about screwing this up.

588
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:47,894
Look, if you like this girl,
you should listen to her.

589
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:55,336
When have I ever moped?

590
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:57,643
I don't even know how. Mm-hmm.

591
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:09,393
- Hello?
- Johnny? It's Oscar.

592
00:26:09,436 --> 00:26:11,830
Calling a cop
on a contraband cellphone

593
00:26:11,874 --> 00:26:13,571
is not the smartest.

594
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,224
Fine. I could just hang up

595
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,923
rather than tell you what I
found out about your boy Jason.

596
00:26:21,449 --> 00:26:22,624
What did you find out?

597
00:26:22,667 --> 00:26:23,798
First things first.

598
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:28,978
I need a letter faxed to my
lawyer's office by 8:00 a.m.

599
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:31,807
supporting my appeal to
change prisons for my safety.

600
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:33,200
I thought I wasn't good enough.

601
00:26:33,242 --> 00:26:35,768
Beggars can't be choosers.
Do we have a deal?

602
00:26:37,116 --> 00:26:38,727
Yeah.
Now tell me what you found.

603
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,643
Okay. I talked to a couple
of buddies of mine in Lompoc.

604
00:26:41,686 --> 00:26:45,385
Apparently, Jason Wyler is the
most charming man on the planet,

605
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:47,257
and he's a cold-blooded
manipulator.

606
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,911
Yeah, but is he dangerous?

607
00:26:48,954 --> 00:26:50,585
I mean, he's serving time
for embezzlement.

608
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,045
He wasn't violent.

609
00:26:52,087 --> 00:26:53,631
From what I've heard,
he doesn't have to be.

610
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,352
He whispers
in all the right ears,

611
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:57,963
and whoever is his enemy ends up
on the wrong end of a shank...

612
00:26:58,007 --> 00:27:00,096
with no way
to trace it back to him.

613
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:28,141
So, alright.
Here's where we're at.

614
00:28:28,183 --> 00:28:30,664
So, we had eyes on Lincoln's
business associates

615
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,144
and possible money sources

616
00:28:32,188 --> 00:28:34,233
all last night,
but Levi never showed.

617
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:37,192
Well, maybe he left town without
getting his hands on any money.

618
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:38,978
That doesn't seem likely.

619
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,414
There's a certain standard
of living he likes to uphold.

620
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,778
So we keep watching his rich
friends and hope for the best.

621
00:28:44,722 --> 00:28:48,029
You know, there is one rich
friend we're notwatching.

622
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:49,596
His double... Lamar Sheff.

623
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,859
Lincoln paid Sheff $5 million
up front to do the time,

624
00:28:51,903 --> 00:28:53,905
and there's no way
the double's family

625
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:55,777
could spend it without
throwing up red flags.

626
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,910
Sheff's wife lives in Whittier.

627
00:28:57,952 --> 00:29:00,303
Harper, Nolan, go check it out.

628
00:29:00,346 --> 00:29:02,827
First thing we have to do is
take your felony off the table.

629
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:05,394
A felony conviction can be
a life sentence to poverty.

630
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:07,309
It'll affect your
future job opportunities,

631
00:29:07,354 --> 00:29:09,224
applying for loans.

632
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:10,549
Oh, man, so I'm screwed,
aren't I?

633
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:12,445
Not if we use Prop 47.

634
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:14,448
Wait. But that's for
personal drug use only.

635
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,276
Yeah, but it's harder
to prove a sales case.

636
00:29:16,318 --> 00:29:18,931
And don't forget... we have
a friendly arresting officer.

637
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:20,778
This will get knocked back
to a misdemeanor possession,

638
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,891
which means
no jail time for you.

639
00:29:22,934 --> 00:29:24,086
For real? So I'm... I'm good?

640
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:25,807
Ha! Not even close.

641
00:29:25,851 --> 00:29:28,156
That's the easy part.
Now comes the hard.

642
00:29:28,201 --> 00:29:31,247
From this day on, you are here
every day after school, okay?

643
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,640
We're gonna review
your homework,

644
00:29:32,682 --> 00:29:34,443
and if there's anything
that you want to talk about,

645
00:29:34,468 --> 00:29:35,556
we'll do that, too.

646
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:37,339
And you're getting a job.

647
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:43,128
Curtis.

648
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:44,346
How you doing?

649
00:29:44,391 --> 00:29:46,785
Me? I'm alright.
I'll be a whole lot better

650
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,526
once Lil' Man
hollers at me outside.

651
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:52,398
Anything you want to say
to Tyler, you can tell us.

652
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:53,616
And who's "us"?

653
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:54,811
I'm part of Tyler's legal team.

654
00:29:54,836 --> 00:29:56,837
Legal team.

655
00:29:56,882 --> 00:29:59,057
Alright. For real?

656
00:29:59,101 --> 00:30:00,798
Okay.

657
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,321
So, check this out, lawyer.

658
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:04,498
Your client here entered
a verbal commitment with me

659
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,934
over the sale of certain items.

660
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:09,894
Those items are now lost.
He owes me restitution.

661
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:12,506
He's getting a job, but he'll
need some time to pay you back.

662
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:14,637
With interest. By tomorrow.

663
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:16,683
Thirty days. No interest.

664
00:30:18,424 --> 00:30:19,773
Excuse me?

665
00:30:19,817 --> 00:30:22,342
Curtis, do not
make this a thing.

666
00:30:22,384 --> 00:30:26,085
Aw. Nah. It's too late
for all that, James.

667
00:30:26,127 --> 00:30:28,391
Now, listen.

668
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:30,915
I came in here alone
out of respect.

669
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,613
In here, this is your world.

670
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:35,094
Out there, that's mine.

671
00:30:36,442 --> 00:30:38,270
I'll be seeing you, Lil' Man.

672
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:42,772
We got to find a place
for him to lay low

673
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:44,798
while we work this out.

674
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,932
I can, uh... I can take him to
his aunt's place in Covina.

675
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:49,978
Hey. Hey. Relax.
It's gonna be okay.

676
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:51,500
But you got to go
to ground, okay?

677
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:53,025
Stay off your phone.

678
00:30:53,067 --> 00:30:54,895
Don't tell anyone where you are.
You got it?

679
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,376
Yeah.

680
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:02,948
You okay?

681
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,210
Yeah.

682
00:31:04,252 --> 00:31:07,038
Well, n-no. Yes. No.

683
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:09,258
I talked to Oscar last night.

684
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,477
What the hell for?

685
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:12,044
He got intel on Jason.

686
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:13,567
The real,
from inside the prison.

687
00:31:13,609 --> 00:31:15,326
And it turns out this guy's
as much of a nightmare

688
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:18,093
as Bailey hinted at.

689
00:31:18,136 --> 00:31:20,182
Well, it doesn't excuse her
not telling you,

690
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,096
but it does explain it.

691
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:24,020
She probably still hasn't
dealt with the trauma.

692
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:26,492
So what do I do?
Do I just... let it slide?

693
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:28,973
If... If Jason is
as dangerous as he says,

694
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:30,584
then he could go
back after Bailey.

695
00:31:30,626 --> 00:31:33,368
Yeah, but Bailey's not exactly
a damsel in distress.

696
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:36,285
I mean, you remember what
she did to that Russian spy.

697
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,548
If he does make a move,
my money's on Bailey.

698
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,384
Hey.

699
00:31:49,429 --> 00:31:51,865
What a, uh, nice surprise.

700
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,477
Uh, I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm all sweaty. Is...

701
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,695
I know what you're doing.

702
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:57,306
Mowing the lawn?

703
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,828
Just stop with the games.

704
00:31:58,873 --> 00:32:01,875
Charming my co-workers,
pretending you want a divorce?

705
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,573
I'm not buying it,
not for one second.

706
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:05,140
You were in my house!

707
00:32:05,183 --> 00:32:07,185
What? No, I wasn't.

708
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:10,102
But you're right about one
thing... I don't want a divorce.

709
00:32:10,144 --> 00:32:11,862
I want things to go back
to the way they were.

710
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:14,758
Uh, which part?
The part where you shamed me,

711
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:18,022
belittled me, tried to control
everything in my life?

712
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,721
Okay. Look.
I-I admit that I wasn't perfect.

713
00:32:20,763 --> 00:32:22,983
But you... you needed help,
guidance, okay?

714
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:24,986
E-Everything that I did,
I did for you.

715
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:26,727
You abused me, Jason!

716
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:28,269
Oh, come on. I never laid
a finger on you!

717
00:32:28,294 --> 00:32:29,511
You didn't have to!

718
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:31,992
You isolated me from
my family and friends!

719
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:34,473
You made me think
it was all my fault!

720
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:36,476
You gaslit me to the point
of a breakdown!

721
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,391
Could we talk about this later?

722
00:32:38,433 --> 00:32:40,784
Hell no!
We are talking about it now!

723
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:43,090
When I left, I was in pieces.

724
00:32:43,134 --> 00:32:44,875
And then I moved out here

725
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:49,009
and I rebuilt my entire life
from scratch.

726
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:50,924
I am not the same person
anymore.

727
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,057
And neither am I!

728
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:54,624
Shut up and listen to me.

729
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:57,626
When I say I am not the same
person anymore, I mean it.

730
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:59,586
And if you push me,

731
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:03,589
I will push back harder
than you can imagine.

732
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:05,200
Do you understand?

733
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,988
Yeah. I understand.

734
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,208
Good.

735
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:16,429
Stay away from me. Forever.

736
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,615
How much farther? About five minutes.

737
00:33:29,659 --> 00:33:31,096
Man: 7-Adam-15, be advised...

738
00:33:31,138 --> 00:33:33,358
Whittier police responded
to a 911 call

739
00:33:33,402 --> 00:33:35,883
about your suspect,
Levi Lincoln.

740
00:33:35,925 --> 00:33:37,624
7-Adam-15. Go ahead.

741
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,105
On-scene detectives confirm
that suspect Levi Lincoln

742
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:42,150
forced his way into a home
at gunpoint,

743
00:33:42,193 --> 00:33:43,891
forced a female victim,
Linda Sheff,

744
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:46,240
to wire $4 million
to a Cayman Islands account.

745
00:33:46,285 --> 00:33:48,287
That's Lamar's wife.

746
00:33:48,329 --> 00:33:50,506
Cayman Islands means
he's fleeing the country.

747
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:53,161
There's a private airfield
somewhere around here.

748
00:33:53,204 --> 00:33:55,336
Take your next right.
It's about a half-mile east.

749
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:57,686
Control, notify local PD.

750
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,080
We believe suspect
is headed for Whittier Airstrip.

751
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:02,344
Have them send backup,
and notify Sgt. Bradford.

752
00:34:10,438 --> 00:34:12,833
Harper: Black motorcycle.
Nolan: Someone's at the plane.

753
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,574
It's Levi.

754
00:34:16,184 --> 00:34:18,056
Gun.

755
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:23,079
Control, taking handgun fire
from the suspect

756
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,148
at Whittier Airstrip.

757
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:26,367
We're pursuing on foot.

758
00:34:42,905 --> 00:34:44,342
What's your plan, Levi?

759
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:46,474
You're trapped,
and we got backup on the way.

760
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,128
One problem at a time.

761
00:34:48,172 --> 00:34:50,784
All I got to do is get rid
of you two and get in my plane.

762
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:52,001
I hate to break it to you,

763
00:34:52,045 --> 00:34:53,873
but law enforcement
has airplanes, too...

764
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:55,353
And this thing called radar.

765
00:34:55,396 --> 00:34:57,965
Plus, getting rid of us
is gonna be a tall order.

766
00:34:58,007 --> 00:34:59,748
Yeah.
I've overcome bigger obstacles.

767
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:18,507
You do realize
you're gonna spend

768
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,943
twice as much time in prison
as you originally were.

769
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:24,164
Was three years of freedom worth
the 10 extra?

770
00:35:40,615 --> 00:35:43,923
Tim: 7-Adam-15.
7-Adam-100 arriving on scene.

771
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,902
What's your status? We have
the suspect pinned down inside.

772
00:35:45,925 --> 00:35:48,275
We could use backup
at the side entrance.

773
00:35:58,286 --> 00:35:59,853
Hi.

774
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:02,333
Drop the gun.

775
00:36:03,943 --> 00:36:06,206
Control, suspect in custody.
We're Code 4.

776
00:36:06,251 --> 00:36:08,731
Fun fact...
It's gonna be a lot harder

777
00:36:08,775 --> 00:36:10,864
to buy your way out of this
with no money.

778
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:12,735
Tell me about it.

779
00:36:12,778 --> 00:36:15,172
Being broke sucks.

780
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:21,396
Thank you.

781
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,833
Yeah. That should be everything.

782
00:36:23,876 --> 00:36:25,313
Officer Chen.

783
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:27,054
You're back.

784
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:28,751
Has it been a year and a half
already?

785
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:31,405
Tyler Stent was just arrested
for armed robbery.

786
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,931
He pointed a gun
at an elderly store owner,

787
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:36,715
who then suffered
a heart attack.

788
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,847
If she dies, I'm charging
your kid with murder.

789
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:41,329
If you hadn't cited him out,
this wouldn't have happened.

790
00:37:01,175 --> 00:37:03,742
Driver, turn off your car
and place both hands

791
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:06,092
out of the window.

792
00:37:06,135 --> 00:37:07,876
What the hell?

793
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,577
Driver, open the door
from the outside.

794
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:14,579
Step out with your hands
above your head.

795
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,759
Step away from the
vehicle. What is going on?

796
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:20,996
Ma'am, step away
from the vehicle!

797
00:37:21,021 --> 00:37:23,849
I haven't done anything wrong.
I'm LAFD.

798
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:25,523
We'll tell you what's going on
in a second.

799
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:27,418
Step away from the vehicle,
ma'am.

800
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:30,900
I-I didn't give you permission
to search my car.

801
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:33,425
What is happening? Why am I...

802
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,318
Wait. That isn't mine. You have a right
to remain silent.

803
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:38,753
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

804
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:42,434
It was my husband.
He's framing me.

805
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:51,702
Nolan?

806
00:38:04,237 --> 00:38:05,413
You got two minutes.

807
00:38:05,456 --> 00:38:06,632
Thank you.

808
00:38:06,806 --> 00:38:07,806
You okay?

809
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:08,981
No. I'm pissed.

810
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:10,244
Jason set me up.

811
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,853
Yes. I know. I know.

812
00:38:11,898 --> 00:38:14,217
His fragile little ego never
could handle being challenged.

813
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:15,554
I should have seen this coming.

814
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:16,858
This is not your fault.

815
00:38:16,902 --> 00:38:20,036
I confronted him at work.
I embarrassed him.

816
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,429
I knew he'd retaliate,
but I didn't care.

817
00:38:22,474 --> 00:38:25,911
I just wanted to show him
that I wasn't scared.

818
00:38:25,954 --> 00:38:27,695
I was sostupid.

819
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:30,481
No. You were right
to stand up to him.

820
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:31,960
There's no winning.

821
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:33,614
I run. He tracks me down.

822
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,791
I fight back.
He takes my career.

823
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:37,402
If I'm convicted
on a drug charge,

824
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:38,838
they'll throw me off the job.

825
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,143
And he knows it.

826
00:38:40,186 --> 00:38:43,059
He's taking everything
that matters to me.

827
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:45,626
It's what he does.

828
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,150
He thinks if I'll get
low enough, I'll go back to him.

829
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:50,545
Okay.
Well, that's never gonna happen.

830
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:52,677
How much is my bail?
I can pay you back.

831
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,376
Okay. Well, it's not quite
that simple.

832
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,422
The amount of cocaine
they found in your car...

833
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:00,076
They're gonna charge you
with a felony.

834
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:01,793
That means you're gonna
have to wait for a judge

835
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:02,817
to set your bail.

836
00:39:05,603 --> 00:39:07,170
And how long will that take?

837
00:39:07,213 --> 00:39:09,869
Hopefully a day, maybe two.

838
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:11,349
But don't worry.

839
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:13,393
While you're in here,
I'm going to fix it.

840
00:39:13,438 --> 00:39:15,309
I can't ask you to do that.

841
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,659
You don't have to.
I'm doing it because I love you.

842
00:39:18,746 --> 00:39:20,706
Still?

843
00:39:20,748 --> 00:39:22,751
Yes. Still.

844
00:39:24,971 --> 00:39:28,061
But that doesn't get us
anywhere near to good.

845
00:39:28,103 --> 00:39:32,065
But nobody screws with you
and gets away with it.

846
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,291
Tyler, what happened?
We had a deal.

847
00:39:42,335 --> 00:39:44,119
I had to get Curtis his money.

848
00:39:44,164 --> 00:39:46,121
No.
We were coming up with a plan.

849
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,862
Why didn't you just listen
to us?

850
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:50,648
I'm sorry. I panicked.

851
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:52,911
I...
Is the lady gonna be alright?

852
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:55,740
We don't know yet.

853
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:58,918
Come on. Move it along.

854
00:40:13,322 --> 00:40:15,150
Voice: Disarm system now.

855
00:40:15,195 --> 00:40:16,936
Hey, buddy.

856
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:24,943
Disarmed. Ready to arm.

857
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:27,686
This is a terrible idea.

858
00:40:27,728 --> 00:40:29,382
No. It's gonna be great, okay?

859
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,949
I want you to feel
as comfortable here

860
00:40:30,992 --> 00:40:32,690
as you do at home.

861
00:40:32,733 --> 00:40:35,344
Look, Carl from the K9 unit said
that dogs respond positively

862
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:36,911
to people who display control,
okay?

863
00:40:36,956 --> 00:40:38,000
They're pack animals.

864
00:40:38,043 --> 00:40:39,653
They know when they see
a leader.

865
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:42,614
I know this is scary,
but I'm right here with you.

866
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:44,746
And I promise you,
you're gonna...

867
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:46,965
You're gonna love him
if you just give him a chance.

868
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:54,842
Sit.

869
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,934
Too nice.
Just boss him around a little.

870
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:03,242
Sit.

871
00:41:06,027 --> 00:41:08,813
Down.

872
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:12,947
Hey, hey. That's my job.

873
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:15,907
Okay, Kojo. One step at a time.

874
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:27,789
It's, uh, John, right?

875
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,617
Good to see you again.

876
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:31,052
No need for the act.

877
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:33,054
You planted those drugs.

878
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:34,882
What? Drugs?

879
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:36,246
Wh... Uh, whoa, whoa. Uh, rewind.

880
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:37,557
I don't know
what you're talking about.

881
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:39,235
Yeah, you do.

882
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:43,195
Bailey's sitting in a jail cell
right now because of you.

883
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,327
She is?

884
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:47,722
Oh, God. That's, uh, horrible.

885
00:41:47,766 --> 00:41:49,681
No.

886
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:51,943
It's exactly what you wanted.

887
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:54,815
Well, of course it isn't.

888
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,557
But, you know, I got to say,

889
00:41:57,601 --> 00:41:59,952
hearing that she's finally
facing some consequences

890
00:41:59,994 --> 00:42:01,735
for her actions, well...

891
00:42:03,215 --> 00:42:06,219
it does well for my spirit.

892
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:12,920
You really can't
let her be happy, can you?

893
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,880
Couldn't stand that she
didn't need you anymore.

894
00:42:15,923 --> 00:42:18,492
Well...

895
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,798
Well, your time is over.

896
00:42:20,842 --> 00:42:23,061
I know who you are now.

897
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,672
And I'm coming for you.
