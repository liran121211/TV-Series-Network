1
00:00:01,135 --> 00:00:01,933
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,196
I would like to formally give
my endorsement for union rep.

3
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:06,666
John Nolan.

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,929
- Dad was a monster.
- Dad's dying.

5
00:00:08,973 --> 00:00:10,365
I'm really sorry about today.

6
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:11,453
I'm still not going to see him.

7
00:00:11,497 --> 00:00:12,759
La Fiera took Angela.

8
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:14,718
I need to know where
she's holding her.

9
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:16,720
- No problem.
- I'll do whatever it takes to get her back.

10
00:00:16,763 --> 00:00:18,069
You work for me now.

11
00:00:18,112 --> 00:00:19,592
Making a deal with Elijah

12
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:21,246
was the only way that I could
get you home safe.

13
00:00:21,289 --> 00:00:23,030
Well, you're not becoming a C.I.

14
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:25,424
I will do everything humanly
possible to keep him safe.

15
00:00:25,467 --> 00:00:26,730
We can't screw this up.

16
00:00:26,773 --> 00:00:27,905
We won't.

17
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:33,084
Ugh.

18
00:00:33,127 --> 00:00:36,043
7-Adam-15, Code 4.
Suspect is in custody.

19
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:40,395
Are you looking at
engagement rings?

20
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,441
Maybe. What do you think
of this one?

21
00:00:42,484 --> 00:00:44,182
Oh, for Bailey? Oh, my God.

22
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:45,618
Are you going to propose?

23
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:47,098
Uh, maybe.
I mean, I'm thinking about it.

24
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:48,316
I-I know we haven't been dating
very long...

25
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,579
No, what matters is how you feel,

26
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:53,365
and... and I've never
seen you happier.

27
00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:55,062
Me and my lady got hitched
after three weeks,

28
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:56,411
and we're still going strong.

29
00:00:56,455 --> 00:00:57,717
- When you know, you know.
- Exactly.

30
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:58,805
The only thing I don't know

31
00:00:58,849 --> 00:00:59,937
is what kind of ring
she would like.

32
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,026
But that's... that's
pretty, right?

33
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:04,028
No one wears emerald cut anymore.

34
00:01:04,071 --> 00:01:05,507
There's a reason
I left that behind.

35
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:08,293
Was Henry excited
when you told him?

36
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:11,775
Henry. They haven't even met.

37
00:01:11,818 --> 00:01:13,994
I can't think about proposing
until I get his blessing.

38
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:15,387
Invite them both over for dinner.

39
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,910
He's in Japan through Christmas.

40
00:01:16,954 --> 00:01:18,738
Oh. You know what? This is good.

41
00:01:18,782 --> 00:01:20,522
It'll give you time
to plan the proposal,

42
00:01:20,566 --> 00:01:22,786
and I know of a photographer
that's not too expensive.

43
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:24,962
A photographer... for a proposal?

44
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:26,615
I could hook you up
with the choreographer

45
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,443
- that designed mine.
- Choreographer?

46
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:30,315
Okay. Um, see,
I was just thinking about

47
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:34,928
going to a nice restaurant
and, you know, asking.

48
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:39,890
Yeah. Let's workshop it
back at the station.

49
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,456
Come on.

50
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
sync & corrections
  jhj@2021

51
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:53,686
Oh, I see what you're doing there.

52
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,123
You asked me
to help decorate your tree.

53
00:01:56,167 --> 00:01:58,560
Yes, that was to trick you into
staying for a few more days.

54
00:01:58,604 --> 00:01:59,735
No trickery required.

55
00:01:59,779 --> 00:02:01,389
Mm.

56
00:02:01,433 --> 00:02:04,305
You know, in spite of myself,
I have really enjoyed

57
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,873
this whole being taken care of
thing the last few weeks.

58
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,396
And now that my leg
is feeling better,

59
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,399
I want to start
making it up to you.

60
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:13,401
Well, while I like
the sound of that,

61
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:15,882
it's really...
Really not necessary.

62
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:17,275
I mean, that's one of
the many built-in perks

63
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:18,667
of being in
a healthy relationship.

64
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:20,713
Which, by the way,
do you still feel

65
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,280
you're terrible at intimacy?

66
00:02:22,323 --> 00:02:24,586
I may have graduated to mediocre.

67
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,762
Oh, I'd say
you're at least intermediate,

68
00:02:26,806 --> 00:02:28,242
if not proficient.

69
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:28,982
Oh.

70
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:30,375
By the way,

71
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:31,550
Henry's supposed
to call this morning.

72
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:32,768
I was hoping the two of you
could talk

73
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:35,641
and finally get a chance
to know one another.

74
00:02:35,684 --> 00:02:38,426
I would love that,
but it's my first day back

75
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,211
from medical, and I can't be late.

76
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:41,952
Speaking of...

77
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,431
Is he free tonight?

78
00:02:43,475 --> 00:02:44,519
Uh, well, he might be in meetings.

79
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:47,087
Tonight is tomorrow for him,
I think?

80
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:48,654
I don't know. I keep forgetting
how the time change works.

81
00:02:48,697 --> 00:02:49,873
Okay, another day, then.

82
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,222
I'm so sorry, I have to go,

83
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:52,788
and tell Henry I said hi, okay?

84
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:54,138
Okay. Bye.

85
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,356
See ya.

86
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,838
Oh. Um, there's, uh...

87
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:00,405
Hey.

88
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:01,754
<i>Hey, Dad.</i>

89
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:03,799
<i>Sorry I'm late.
Dinner ran a little long.</i>

90
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:05,801
Uh, no. No... No problem.

91
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:07,151
How's Japan?

92
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:09,414
Well, Nolan says
an open concept sells better,

93
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:11,372
so I'm thinking
we take out this wall

94
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:12,896
and then move on to the kitchen.

95
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:15,376
Do you remember how Mom used to
make us pose by the window

96
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,161
for every formal dance?

97
00:03:17,204 --> 00:03:18,771
Oh, my gosh. My mom did that, too.

98
00:03:18,814 --> 00:03:21,165
And I always had to have
a wrist corsage.

99
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,775
Yes. Why was that ever a thing?

100
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:24,864
No. No more reminiscing.

101
00:03:24,908 --> 00:03:26,648
This is about fixing up
the house and selling it.

102
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:28,694
- That's it.
- What? Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

103
00:03:28,737 --> 00:03:31,523
I mean, you guys are ending
a huge chapter in your lives.

104
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:33,003
You guys need closure.

105
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:35,614
What?

106
00:03:35,657 --> 00:03:37,007
I said you need closure!

107
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,443
What?

108
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:39,748
You're an idiot.

109
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:44,492
Did you vote yet?

110
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:45,972
The polls just opened
20 minutes ago.

111
00:03:46,016 --> 00:03:47,365
We have all week.

112
00:03:47,408 --> 00:03:49,149
I know. Vote for change.

113
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:51,238
I just know that low voter turnout

114
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:52,413
is an epidemic in this country,

115
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:53,545
and I don't want to
lose to apathy.

116
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:54,720
Can I ask you something?

117
00:03:54,763 --> 00:03:55,982
Do you think marriage proposals

118
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:57,636
have to be a big spectacle
nowadays?

119
00:03:57,679 --> 00:03:58,985
No. No.

120
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:01,727
All those viral
flash mobs are tacky.

121
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,729
It should be an intimate moment,

122
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:05,992
not some desperate grab for likes.

123
00:04:06,036 --> 00:04:07,689
Okay. That's what I thought,

124
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,648
but Lucy seems to think
I need to plan

125
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:11,041
something extravagant.

126
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,086
Is Lucy the one you're
proposing to? No.

127
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:15,262
Am I the one you're
proposing to? No.

128
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,482
So why are you talking to
either of us about this? Right.

129
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:21,225
The only person's opinion
who matters is Bailey's.

130
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:23,270
Yeah, I-I'm not even sure
myself yet.

131
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:25,359
I'm just testing the
waters. Mm-hmm.

132
00:04:25,403 --> 00:04:27,535
Well, whenever you do, make sure

133
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:30,321
that you let her
help you pick out a ring.

134
00:04:30,364 --> 00:04:33,411
Donovan got me this massive
diamond that cost a fortune

135
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:35,500
and was not my
style at all. Really?

136
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:37,719
One of the best things
about the divorce

137
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:39,983
was finally getting to
sell that thing.

138
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:41,462
Huh. Tamara, hey.

139
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:43,203
Oh. Hey, John.

140
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:44,857
Do you know where
Sergeant Grey's office is?

141
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,206
I sure do.
The big glass one right there.

142
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,034
Oh. Thank you. See ya.

143
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:50,689
Hey. Ready for our interview?

144
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:54,519
I am so sorry.
I... Something came up.

145
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,434
Is there any way we can
reschedule to next week?

146
00:04:56,477 --> 00:05:00,090
Uh, my criminal sociology
paper's due on Friday.

147
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,961
But it's fine.
I'm sure whatever you're doing

148
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:03,354
is way more important.

149
00:05:03,397 --> 00:05:05,095
Remind me what this paper's
about again.

150
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,011
Um, how aging affects perspectives
of cops throughout their career.

151
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:10,013
And Lucy told me you'd be
the perfect candidate

152
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:11,318
because you're an old...

153
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,973
I'm sorry.
Uh, I mean veteran officer.

154
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:15,279
Right.

155
00:05:17,629 --> 00:05:18,673
Follow me.

156
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:25,071
Smitty, this is Tamara.

157
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,551
She'll be shadowing you.

158
00:05:26,594 --> 00:05:28,074
You mean like a ride-along?

159
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,771
No. Not...

160
00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:33,123
You are not to step foot outside
this station with her.

161
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,299
Just show her around,
answer her questions.

162
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:36,604
Sure thing, boss.

163
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:42,088
There's nothing I don't know
about policing.

164
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:43,698
Ask me anything.

165
00:05:43,742 --> 00:05:44,960
You spelled "magnet" wrong.

166
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,096
Our target is Elijah Stone.

167
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,142
He's smart and ruthless.

168
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,666
Multiple agencies have tried
to get listening devices

169
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,233
in his base of operation.

170
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,017
Every attempt has failed.

171
00:05:58,061 --> 00:05:59,975
But other agencies didn't have
our ace in the hole...

172
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,586
Wesley Evers.

173
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,197
As Elijah's lawyer,
Wesley is ideally situated

174
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:07,418
to place a listening device
in Elijah's main office.

175
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:10,029
Please familiarize yourself
with the briefing materials

176
00:06:10,073 --> 00:06:11,378
and be ready to roll out
in an hour.

177
00:06:11,422 --> 00:06:13,206
That's it.

178
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,339
You don't have to do this,
you know.

179
00:06:15,382 --> 00:06:16,775
Yes, I do.

180
00:06:16,818 --> 00:06:18,255
This is the bug
you'll be planting.

181
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:20,257
Did you read the list
of suggested locations

182
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,649
I put together?

183
00:06:21,693 --> 00:06:22,998
I did, but I doubt I'm gonna time

184
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:24,652
to unscrew an electrical socket.

185
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,263
With limited time,
I would focus on some place high

186
00:06:26,306 --> 00:06:27,525
or some place low.

187
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:29,309
The most important thing
is doing it safely.

188
00:06:29,353 --> 00:06:31,833
Agreed. If you do not have
the opportunity today,

189
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:32,878
that's fine.

190
00:06:32,921 --> 00:06:34,009
We can try again

191
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:35,272
when you meet with him next time.

192
00:06:35,315 --> 00:06:37,448
Wesley, Metro wants to go over
a few things.

193
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:43,758
I know cops aren't supposed to
make promises,

194
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:45,630
but promise me
you'll keep him safe.

195
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:49,460
We promise.

196
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:51,984
So, you've been on the force for
30 years.

197
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:52,985
What's been the biggest challenge

198
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:54,247
as you've gotten older?

199
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,423
The change in technology?
Procedure?

200
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,251
Yes.

201
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:01,559
Hey, you ever heard of ClipTalk?

202
00:07:01,602 --> 00:07:03,735
I'm trying to upload a meme.

203
00:07:06,346 --> 00:07:08,087
You can't be serious.

204
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:09,349
This is how you want to
beat your opponent?

205
00:07:09,393 --> 00:07:11,351
Hell yeah. Help me go viral

206
00:07:11,395 --> 00:07:13,353
and I'll buy you a candy bar.

207
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:16,704
Surveillance is in position.

208
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:19,185
Copy.
Rescue Vehicle One in position.

209
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,448
Wesley should arrive for
his meeting with Elijah

210
00:07:21,492 --> 00:07:23,146
in about 10 minutes.

211
00:07:27,585 --> 00:07:29,543
Oh, my skip tracer
just sent his report.

212
00:07:29,587 --> 00:07:30,762
<i>Your</i> skip tracer?

213
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:32,111
Well, yeah, I can't use
police resources

214
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:33,286
to run personal background checks,

215
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,549
so I got a guy on retainer.

216
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:37,160
You should have one, too.

217
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:38,291
What do you got him looking for?

218
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:39,771
Leverage.

219
00:07:39,814 --> 00:07:41,381
I'm trying to find anything
I can use

220
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:43,078
to keep Donovan
from getting custody

221
00:07:43,122 --> 00:07:45,342
and moving Lila to San Francisco.

222
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,605
And? Did he find anything?

223
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:49,868
Uh, no.

224
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:53,872
Quote, "Your ex is so boring,
I am charging you double."

225
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:55,352
You guys are so lucky.

226
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:57,484
I begged my mom and dad
to have a sibling.

227
00:07:57,528 --> 00:07:59,225
They got me a turtle.

228
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:02,185
Um, it was cute,
but a little smelly.

229
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:04,796
Cute and smelly pretty much
sums up Tim's teenage years.

230
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,798
You didn't miss much.

231
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:09,366
Wow. And to think
I was actually excited

232
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:11,019
when they brought you home
from the hospital.

233
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:12,238
Little did I know.

234
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:25,077
What is it?

235
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,079
There's... There's something
in the wall.

236
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:29,255
Ooh, is it my Malibu Barbie?
She's worth a lot now.

237
00:08:29,299 --> 00:08:30,561
No. It's... It's metal.

238
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,270
What the hell is a gun doing
in our wall?

239
00:08:47,948 --> 00:08:49,733
How long has that been back there?

240
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:51,517
It's hard to say.

241
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,912
Look. The serial number's
been filed off.

242
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:57,349
That's what criminals do, right?

243
00:08:57,392 --> 00:08:59,046
We need to run ballistics.

244
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,092
Wait, you don't actually think
it was used in a crime?

245
00:09:01,135 --> 00:09:02,833
Well, it's our job to find out.

246
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,573
We'll be back as soon as we can.

247
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:06,358
But it's your day off.
You said you'd help.

248
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:07,881
It won't take long.

249
00:09:07,925 --> 00:09:09,100
C'mon, Chen.

250
00:09:09,143 --> 00:09:11,276
I knew you'd find
some excuse to leave.

251
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:12,799
Genny, this is serious.

252
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,758
It's fine. Go.

253
00:09:17,064 --> 00:09:17,673
Uh...

254
00:09:20,198 --> 00:09:21,808
Hey, she's got a point.

255
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,070
I mean, you could've called
someone to handle this.

256
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:24,680
You still can.

257
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:26,813
No, a good sergeant doesn't
create work for his officers.

258
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,901
Even on his day off.

259
00:09:27,945 --> 00:09:29,468
And it's not at all about
the emotions

260
00:09:29,511 --> 00:09:30,991
this house is stirring up?

261
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:32,471
It's just a house.

262
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:36,344
Holy crap. What?

263
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:39,826
My skip tracer looked into
Penelope, Donovan's fiancée.

264
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,828
She used to be an escort.

265
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,482
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

266
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,963
She's... She's been lying to him
this whole time.

267
00:09:46,006 --> 00:09:47,268
Well, you don't know that.

268
00:09:47,312 --> 00:09:48,661
She may have already told Donovan.

269
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:50,271
Or, heck, that could be
how they met.

270
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:52,665
Oh, no. No.
Donovan is such a prude.

271
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,536
If he found out, he would lose it.

272
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,105
And if the court found out,
you'd win your case.

273
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,848
It just doesn't feel right,
bringing her into our fight.

274
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,284
And the fact that
she was a sex worker

275
00:10:03,328 --> 00:10:05,939
has no bearing on her
as a stepmom.

276
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:07,462
Neither does you doing undercover,

277
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:08,986
but he's using that against you.

278
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:11,510
Sure, but using her past
against her

279
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:13,294
makes me just as bad as Donovan.

280
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:15,601
I can't. I-I got to figure out
something else

281
00:10:15,644 --> 00:10:17,081
to change his mind.

282
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,212
Okay. Any ideas how?

283
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:19,692
No.

284
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:23,261
Heads up.

285
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:24,697
Wesley's going in.

286
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,269
Elijah's expecting me.

287
00:10:31,312 --> 00:10:33,314
Cellphone.

288
00:10:49,287 --> 00:10:50,462
Come in.

289
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:52,464
Sit down.

290
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:55,293
So, how are we getting Reyes
out of trouble?

291
00:10:55,336 --> 00:10:57,469
I can get the witness testimony
thrown out, but the, uh,

292
00:10:57,512 --> 00:10:59,166
<i>surveillance video's
a whole other problem.</i>

293
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:04,519
Looking for something?

294
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,695
You guys paint
since I was last here?

295
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:07,914
<i>No.</i>

296
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,959
Room looks different.

297
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,961
Must be the Christmas decorations.

298
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,919
As I was saying,
the video is a problem,

299
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,486
but your bigger issue is your guys

300
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:16,183
- don't know how to.
- Get arrested. - He's doing great.

301
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:17,706
<i>They can't keep assaulting
police officers.</i>

302
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,143
Yeah.

303
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:20,753
He'll be fine.

304
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,363
Resisting arrest is making
my life harder.

305
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:24,061
You hear that, Moreno?

306
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:26,324
Our friend thinks I'm making
life too hard for him.

307
00:11:26,367 --> 00:11:28,630
No, it's just... It's what, Counselor?

308
00:11:28,674 --> 00:11:29,936
What part of our arrangement

309
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,633
is about making your life easier?

310
00:11:31,677 --> 00:11:34,071
Hmm. Nothing.

311
00:11:34,114 --> 00:11:35,507
<i>Piece of unsolicited advice...</i>

312
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,900
Fire Reyes as soon as possible.

313
00:11:36,943 --> 00:11:39,119
So? He punched
the arresting officer.

314
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:41,774
- Reyes is good people.
- Reyes is a moron.

315
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:44,081
He bragged about the assault
to an inmate in lockup,

316
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:45,821
ended up being an informant.

317
00:11:45,865 --> 00:11:47,911
- Where is he?
- Making a run to the food bank.

318
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:50,087
Alright, when he's done,
get him in here.

319
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,872
Someone needs a refresher course
on keeping his damn mouth shut.

320
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:59,792
Now, I'm hearing whispers about
a threat on the horizon,

321
00:11:59,835 --> 00:12:01,489
but I can't get traction on it.

322
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:03,404
- That's news to me.
- Well, what about your wife?

323
00:12:03,448 --> 00:12:04,971
Has she heard anything?

324
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,930
Uh... I don't know.

325
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,583
<i>You guys are lucky to have me.</i>

326
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:10,194
That's the signal.

327
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:11,978
Point to all units.
Friendly has given the signal.

328
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,893
Go ahead and initiate "Blind Eye."

329
00:12:13,937 --> 00:12:16,069
I can't make any promises, but...

330
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:20,291
What's going on?

331
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:21,466
We may have a problem.

332
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:31,476
Get your hands up!

333
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,781
- Get your hands up!
- Hands up!

334
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:34,609
- Don't move!
- Hands behind your head.

335
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:35,697
Get down on your knees.

336
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:37,395
Well, that's not ours.

337
00:12:37,438 --> 00:12:38,700
No. Never seen him before.

338
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:39,745
Everything okay, guys?

339
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:41,921
Yeah, it's nothing. Just, uh...

340
00:12:41,965 --> 00:12:44,619
That's the second signal.
He's planted the bug.

341
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,492
Music has been deployed.
Stop units can clear.

342
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:50,016
He did it. Now get out of there.

343
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,887
<i>Well, that's it.</i>

344
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:53,193
<i>That's all I got for you.</i>

345
00:12:53,237 --> 00:12:54,803
He's walking out now.

346
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:56,022
Okay, good work, Counselor.

347
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,024
Keep me updated on Reyes.

348
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,678
Will do. But seriously,

349
00:12:59,721 --> 00:13:01,593
fire him or teach him
to keep his mouth shut.

350
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:04,726
Boaz.

351
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,598
Come walk out the lawyer.
He's ready to go.

352
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,252
<i>Go again.</i>

353
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:11,516
Boaz, do you copy?

354
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,170
Come get the lawyer.

355
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:16,912
That's static.

356
00:13:16,956 --> 00:13:18,436
The bug Wesley planted
could create interference

357
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:19,959
with a two-way radio.

358
00:13:20,003 --> 00:13:22,179
We didn't know they use
walkie-talkies in there?

359
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:23,963
- Harper, come in.
- Already on it.

360
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:26,966
All units, stand by.
Be ready to breach on my go.

361
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,141
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

362
00:13:28,185 --> 00:13:29,969
Come again?

363
00:13:30,013 --> 00:13:32,058
Can I just walk myself out?

364
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,755
I mean, seriously,
I have a meeting across town

365
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:34,800
in 30 minutes.

366
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:36,062
Oh, no, no. Slow up, Counselor.

367
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:37,368
It can wait.

368
00:13:40,936 --> 00:13:43,548
This is very interesting.

369
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,857
<i>You know, from what I recall,
when the sirens went off,</i>

370
00:13:48,901 --> 00:13:51,904
<i>you didn't even jump.</i>

371
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:53,166
<i>Didn't even bother to look.</i>

372
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,864
It's almost like you knew
they were coming.

373
00:13:55,908 --> 00:13:57,388
What the hell
are you talking about?

374
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:04,786
Mm.

375
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:12,707
We may need a new exterminator.

376
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,448
We have to go now.

377
00:14:14,492 --> 00:14:16,102
No. Elijah's too smart

378
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,496
to hurt Wesley
while we're listening.

379
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:20,193
All units hold.

380
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:21,934
What is that?

381
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:25,329
No, no, no, no. Don't even play.

382
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:28,462
Testing, testing.

383
00:14:28,506 --> 00:14:30,334
Can you hear me?

384
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:33,424
Whoever you are.

385
00:14:33,467 --> 00:14:35,904
Is it the FBI?

386
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:37,993
The DEA? Oh, wait.

387
00:14:38,037 --> 00:14:41,345
No. Of course. What am I thinking?

388
00:14:41,388 --> 00:14:43,216
It's the LAPD.

389
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,611
I bet your lovely wife is out
there listening, too, isn't she?

390
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:49,744
Angie, you out there, sweetheart?

391
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,616
You're smart. You know I don't say

392
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,748
anything incriminating
in front of your husband,

393
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,359
so you turned him into
a Trojan Horse

394
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:57,709
to leave a bug behind.

395
00:14:57,752 --> 00:15:01,191
And your little game
almost worked, too.

396
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:05,020
Speaking of games,
you know what my favorite is?

397
00:15:05,064 --> 00:15:07,980
"I Spy."

398
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:12,419
I spy with my little eye
a pest control van.

399
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:14,378
No. No.

400
00:15:14,421 --> 00:15:16,989
No, you wouldn't be in there.
That's too "Miami Vice."

401
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:19,252
Oh. There's a mail truck.

402
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:20,949
<i>No, no, no.
That has to stay on the move,</i>

403
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:22,429
lest someone get suspicious.

404
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:26,216
Oh. The minivan.

405
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,175
Roomy enough for equipment,
yet nondescript.

406
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,482
So, tell me, Angie,
did I win the game?

407
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:34,093
Of course I did.

408
00:15:34,137 --> 00:15:35,660
I always win. You know why?

409
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:38,924
Because I play by the rules.

410
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:40,665
Which means I'm gonna report
your husband

411
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:43,276
to the California State Bar.

412
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,191
That's right.

413
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,975
I'm gonna have
his law license revoked

414
00:15:47,019 --> 00:15:49,413
for betraying the trust
of a client.

415
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:51,154
This is not over.

416
00:15:51,197 --> 00:15:53,591
For you, it is.

417
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:58,204
Wesley, come on, man.

418
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,250
He's all yours. I just fired him.

419
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,513
- Listen to me closely.
- Uh-huh.

420
00:16:02,556 --> 00:16:04,210
You lay a hand on him
or his family,

421
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,430
it'll be the last thing you do
as a free man.

422
00:16:06,473 --> 00:16:08,475
I don't need to touch him.

423
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,260
He just screwed himself.

424
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,217
Let's go.

425
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,697
Walk away.

426
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,178
Until we meet again, Counselor.

427
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:21,402
Hey, ballistics came back on
the gun we found in the wall.

428
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:22,838
That was fast.

429
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,536
Yeah, I mean, I had to buy
a case of Girl Scout cookies

430
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,060
from Derek's kid. You're welcome.

431
00:16:27,103 --> 00:16:30,063
Okay, so, the striations
from the gun match up

432
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:33,327
with a bullet from
a homicide from 25 years ago.

433
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:36,025
The murder victim's name
was Frank Ochoa.

434
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:37,766
He lived down the street.

435
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,594
I was 14 when he was murdered.

436
00:16:39,638 --> 00:16:41,857
According to the case file,
Frank's murder

437
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,860
was the result of a suspected
botched home invasion.

438
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,210
Well, I think we can rule that out

439
00:16:46,253 --> 00:16:47,689
now that we found the gun
in our wall.

440
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:49,430
Do you remember anything
from that night?

441
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:50,953
Yeah, I had a football game.

442
00:16:50,997 --> 00:16:54,174
Uh, my mom took me and Genny,
and when we got back,

443
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:56,350
there were cops everywhere.

444
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:58,004
My dad hated that guy.

445
00:16:58,047 --> 00:16:59,397
Your dad had an alibi.

446
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,573
Um, Frank's wife, Monica.

447
00:17:01,616 --> 00:17:03,270
She was at the house.

448
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,272
He was helping her with her taxes.

449
00:17:05,316 --> 00:17:06,882
Monica is not a solid alibi.

450
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,884
They were having an affair.

451
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,887
My mom didn't know, but I did.

452
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,891
Uh, if... if Frank discovered
the affair...

453
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:18,242
My dad would have had motive
to kill him.

454
00:17:18,285 --> 00:17:19,765
That's how the gun ended up
in the wall.

455
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:21,897
Okay, but why hide it in there?

456
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:24,378
I mean, why not just dump it
in a storm drain or an ocean?

457
00:17:24,422 --> 00:17:26,162
I don't know.

458
00:17:26,206 --> 00:17:28,382
- You did good today.
- Not good enough.

459
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:31,167
The radio interference
wasn't your fault.

460
00:17:31,211 --> 00:17:33,735
Doesn't make me any less scared.

461
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:35,171
What's next?

462
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:37,348
We regroup and hit this
in the morning.

463
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:39,524
You two go home, cuddle Jack.

464
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,003
Install the VARDA system.

465
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:42,875
And get to know
your security detail.

466
00:17:42,918 --> 00:17:44,746
- VARDA?
- Don't worry.

467
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,140
It's only the most intrusive
and creepy security system

468
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:49,055
ever invented.

469
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:50,361
Thank you for everything.

470
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:51,840
I wish I could do more.

471
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,723
Hey. Why are you letting Smitty
walk all over you?

472
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:07,595
I'm not letting Smitty... Yes, you are.

473
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:09,728
I've been here watching Smitty
talk smack about you

474
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:12,034
to the other officers.
I-It's obscene.

475
00:18:12,078 --> 00:18:13,427
Please tell me you're planning
on hitting back.

476
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:16,038
Okay, I agree it's not great,

477
00:18:16,082 --> 00:18:17,997
but Smitty has chosen his path,

478
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,433
and I'm not gonna get anywhere
if I resort to

479
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:20,826
the same tricks he does.

480
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,218
But you're still not
gonna get anywhere

481
00:18:22,262 --> 00:18:23,524
if you let this happen, either.

482
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:24,960
You could lose.

483
00:18:25,004 --> 00:18:26,745
I think negativity
turns off voters.

484
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:28,616
I'm gonna run a clean campaign...

485
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,576
And apologies, I do have a call
scheduled with my son.

486
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:32,751
Can we pick this up later?

487
00:18:32,794 --> 00:18:34,143
Sure. Thank you.

488
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:42,326
Don't tell me you have
more interview questions?

489
00:18:42,369 --> 00:18:44,371
Just one.

490
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,981
You want to go viral?

491
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,374
I'll help you make the video.

492
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,768
What's your ClipTalk password?

493
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:51,160
Hey, where you going?

494
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:52,814
Monica Ochoa's in Interrogation.

495
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:53,946
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.

496
00:18:53,989 --> 00:18:55,251
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

497
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:57,384
You're going to question
your father's mistress?

498
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,951
She's his alibi.

499
00:18:58,994 --> 00:19:00,387
If anyone knows whether
or not my dad killed

500
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,910
her husband, it's her.

501
00:19:01,954 --> 00:19:04,217
Yes, but you can't be
the one to question her.

502
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,784
Look, we need to do this right.

503
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,875
You do it.

504
00:19:12,268 --> 00:19:14,270
Thank you for coming in,
Mrs. Ochoa.

505
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:16,838
Of course.
So, what is this all about?

506
00:19:16,882 --> 00:19:18,187
Your husband's murder.

507
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:20,102
We recently had a break
in the case,

508
00:19:20,146 --> 00:19:22,104
and we just wanted to go over
a few details with you.

509
00:19:22,148 --> 00:19:23,454
<i>What do you mean,
a break in the case?</i>

510
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,890
<i>It's been 25 years.</i>

511
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,587
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to discuss

512
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:28,197
the details at this time.

513
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:30,069
What do you remember
about that night?

514
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:31,723
I have been over this
so many times.

515
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,551
Don't you have the report?
It's all in there.

516
00:19:33,594 --> 00:19:35,074
I'm sorry.

517
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:37,903
I realize this is
a painful subject.

518
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:39,557
I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

519
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:43,909
<i>I was across the street
at the neighbors'.</i>

520
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:45,563
<i>The Bradfords.</i>

521
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:48,783
<i>Right. Tom was helping me
with our taxes.</i>

522
00:19:48,827 --> 00:19:51,438
<i>Um, I had made a mess with them,</i>

523
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:54,833
and he was a CPA.

524
00:19:54,876 --> 00:19:58,793
When I got back home,
the door was open,

525
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:01,361
and, um...

526
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:04,233
the place was a mess.

527
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:08,107
I-I'm sorry.
Um, it's been a very long time

528
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,804
since I've had to talk about this.

529
00:20:09,848 --> 00:20:13,068
Uh, just take your time.

530
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:17,072
I found, uh, my husband, Frank.

531
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,118
He was... His body
was in the kitchen.

532
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:23,862
Um, there was blood everywhere.

533
00:20:23,905 --> 00:20:25,472
<i>I guess he surprised
whoever broke in,</i>

534
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:29,041
and, um, they shot him.

535
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:32,610
You were close with
the Bradford family?

536
00:20:32,653 --> 00:20:34,568
We socialized,
like neighbors used to.

537
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:37,615
So, the night of the murder,
you were at their house,

538
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:40,052
working on your taxes, and, uh,

539
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:41,793
the rest of the Bradford family
was there?

540
00:20:41,836 --> 00:20:44,099
<i>Uh, no, Mrs. Bradford and the kids</i>

541
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:47,451
<i>were at, um, a basketball game
or something.</i>

542
00:20:47,494 --> 00:20:49,801
<i>Okay, so you were alone
with the husband.</i>

543
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:50,889
Was this a regular occurrence?

544
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,458
What are you getting at?

545
00:20:54,501 --> 00:20:57,330
I-I'm just trying to understand
what happened.

546
00:20:57,373 --> 00:21:01,508
Uh, did... did Mr. Bradford, um,
leave at any point?

547
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:05,599
<i>Uh, I-I'm sorry. Could we maybe
do this another time?</i>

548
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:08,733
<i>It would be easier
if we got it done now.</i>

549
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:11,344
I don't know.
Uh, you just sprung this on me,

550
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:13,389
and, um, you're asking a lot.

551
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:14,913
Yeah. You know what?
If we just get

552
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:16,480
a few more questions,
we'll... we'll be done

553
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:17,742
and get you right out of here.

554
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:20,222
No, I-I want to go now.

555
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:26,315
Tim?

556
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,404
Mrs. Ochoa.

557
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,406
Did my father leave
at any point that night?

558
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:33,932
Of course not. You think that
I lied to the police?

559
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:35,586
Look, I know you were
having an affair...

560
00:21:35,629 --> 00:21:37,326
Excuse me? It's fine.

561
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:40,286
It was a long time ago.
But if you're protecting him...

562
00:21:40,329 --> 00:21:41,809
Okay. That's it. I'm done.

563
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,163
She's covering for him.

564
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:50,426
Maybe, but we can't prove that.

565
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,515
Thanks so much.

566
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:57,303
So, we have two officers
standing guard on rotation

567
00:21:57,346 --> 00:21:58,957
for the next 72 hours,

568
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,567
motion sensors in the front yard,

569
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,222
and an alarm system
that will bypass 911

570
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:05,485
and send a red alert
to every cop in the area

571
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:07,052
if anything happens.

572
00:22:07,095 --> 00:22:08,749
No way Elijah makes it
through that door.

573
00:22:08,793 --> 00:22:10,577
How long do we have
to live like this?

574
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,057
Hey, the only thing that matters

575
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,538
is that our family is safe.

576
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:16,365
It's gonna be okay.

577
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:19,020
Totally. And I'm probably
gonna lose my law license,

578
00:22:19,064 --> 00:22:23,242
but on the bright side,
more time with Jack.

579
00:22:26,462 --> 00:22:28,377
- Where you going?
- Back to work.

580
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:31,337
I'm not letting
that criminal beat us.

581
00:22:34,601 --> 00:22:37,212
Hi.

582
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:40,607
Thanks for coming all the way
down here at the last minute.

583
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,827
What am I doing here, Nyla?

584
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,829
Okay. Well, uh,
I know that we're back to

585
00:22:44,872 --> 00:22:47,353
talking through lawyers,

586
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:51,270
but I thought we could have
an actual conversation

587
00:22:51,313 --> 00:22:54,578
and avoid dragging Lila
through another

588
00:22:54,621 --> 00:22:57,058
painful custody fight.

589
00:22:57,102 --> 00:22:58,494
Okay.

590
00:22:58,538 --> 00:22:59,887
What are you proposing?

591
00:22:59,931 --> 00:23:03,325
Since Lila has her school
and her friends here,

592
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:07,155
I am proposing that she spend
the school year with me,

593
00:23:07,199 --> 00:23:10,898
and the entire summer,
she can be with you.

594
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:13,292
And obviously,
you can visit any time.

595
00:23:16,034 --> 00:23:18,558
What are you thinking?

596
00:23:18,602 --> 00:23:19,646
I think there's more to consider

597
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,082
than just school and friends.

598
00:23:21,126 --> 00:23:22,693
Okay, like what?

599
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,869
Like the fact that you've been
an absentee parent

600
00:23:24,912 --> 00:23:26,305
until recently.

601
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:27,872
Look, I will admit that my old job

602
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:29,351
took up a lot of my time,

603
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:32,311
but that is why
I switched to patrol.

604
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:35,053
I'm sorry, why are we meeting
in front of your station

605
00:23:35,096 --> 00:23:37,055
instead of the restaurant
you suggested this morning?

606
00:23:37,098 --> 00:23:39,318
Because I am working overtime
on a case.

607
00:23:39,361 --> 00:23:41,146
Right.

608
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:42,887
So you want me to give you
full custody

609
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,062
so a nanny can raise our child?

610
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:45,933
That is not fair.
Come on, Donovan,

611
00:23:45,977 --> 00:23:47,543
what is this really about?

612
00:23:47,587 --> 00:23:49,894
- Let me guess... - what happened at Halloween?
- No. No.

613
00:23:49,937 --> 00:23:52,679
Yes, it is. You feel guilty that
we slept together.

614
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,334
- It was an accident.
- That we both made,

615
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:59,686
so stop punishing me
over it. I'm... I'm not.

616
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,732
For two years,
I have been the only parent

617
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,516
helping her with her school
work, going on field trips,

618
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:04,996
taking her to every single
doctor's appointment.

619
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,388
Where were you?

620
00:24:06,432 --> 00:24:08,129
Okay.

621
00:24:08,173 --> 00:24:09,740
I think the court would agree
that I am the parent

622
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:13,221
that is the most... Please do not do this.

623
00:24:13,265 --> 00:24:16,834
Not just to me,
but to our daughter.

624
00:24:16,877 --> 00:24:18,792
She's adaptable.
She'll make friends at school,

625
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:20,402
and when she gets home,
she'll have two parents

626
00:24:20,446 --> 00:24:22,187
there waiting for her.

627
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,973
Nyla, Penelope and I
can give her stability.

628
00:24:26,017 --> 00:24:28,106
Oh, right. Penelope.

629
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:30,412
What's that supposed to mean?

630
00:24:30,456 --> 00:24:32,806
Nothing. I will see you in court.

631
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,693
Oh, man.

632
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:50,607
Never thought
I'd see your face again.

633
00:24:50,651 --> 00:24:52,435
Genny tell you to visit?

634
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:56,222
Wow, liver really did
a number on you, old man.

635
00:24:56,265 --> 00:24:58,050
I don't have it so bad.

636
00:24:58,093 --> 00:25:00,835
Nurses here all love me.
It's just...

637
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:03,185
no one will bring me that shot
of Patrón I keep asking for.

638
00:25:06,101 --> 00:25:07,320
Ah.

639
00:25:07,363 --> 00:25:08,756
Apple juice.

640
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,410
It's a joke.

641
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:13,152
You always seem to have
someone looking after you,

642
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:15,067
even when you don't deserve it.

643
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,896
Something on your mind, son?

644
00:25:17,939 --> 00:25:20,463
Remember Frank Ochoa?

645
00:25:20,507 --> 00:25:21,726
Lived down the street.

646
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:24,076
Shot to death 25 years ago.

647
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,295
Well, I-I'm sure you remember
his wife, Monica.

648
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:27,732
Can't say that I do.

649
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:29,342
Come on.

650
00:25:29,385 --> 00:25:32,084
You were sleeping with her
behind Mom's back.

651
00:25:32,127 --> 00:25:33,738
Where'd you get that from?

652
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:38,481
Because I saw you two together
when I was 13.

653
00:25:38,525 --> 00:25:41,093
Oh. Crap.

654
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:45,575
For some reason that I still
don't understand,

655
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:48,317
I lied for you, lied to Mom.

656
00:25:48,361 --> 00:25:49,928
Poor little Tim-Tim.

657
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:52,887
What are you bitching about?

658
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:55,150
You kept your mouth shut.
You did good.

659
00:25:55,194 --> 00:25:56,848
Now get over it.

660
00:25:56,891 --> 00:26:00,199
You know, I found the gun that
you hid in the wall.

661
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:04,246
I know you killed Frank.

662
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,989
But why'd you do it?

663
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:10,949
You wanted Monica all to yourself?

664
00:26:10,992 --> 00:26:13,342
Ruining one family just wasn't
enough for you, was it?

665
00:26:17,564 --> 00:26:19,784
And so what if I did?

666
00:26:21,786 --> 00:26:24,397
What are you gonna do about it?

667
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,877
Get back in bed.

668
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:29,010
Make me.

669
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,975
Yeah. That's what I thought.

670
00:26:40,587 --> 00:26:42,850
You're right.

671
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:45,287
I killed Frank.

672
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:47,507
But he had it coming.

673
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,814
So, screw him, and screw you.

674
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:51,119
Put the cuffs on me.

675
00:26:51,163 --> 00:26:53,600
Drag me away from my death bed
like a big man.

676
00:26:53,643 --> 00:26:55,384
This isn't over.

677
00:26:55,428 --> 00:26:56,908
Get the hell out of here.

678
00:27:05,481 --> 00:27:06,961
Okay, one second.

679
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:08,267
Here comes Bailey.

680
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,659
Everyone on?

681
00:27:09,703 --> 00:27:11,792
<i>Hi, Henry. Hey, Bailey.</i>

682
00:27:11,836 --> 00:27:13,663
<i>It's nice to finally...</i>

683
00:27:13,707 --> 00:27:14,708
Buddy, you're breaking up.

684
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:16,188
Now... Now you're frozen.

685
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:18,407
Now he's gone. Hang on a second.

686
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:19,582
I'll ring him up.

687
00:27:19,626 --> 00:27:21,106
Oh, there he is.
Hang on. I'll answer.

688
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:23,630
There you are, Henry.
Can you hear me?

689
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:25,284
<i>Hey, sorry, service is
a little spotty over here.</i>

690
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:27,112
I'm just happy
my two favorite people

691
00:27:27,155 --> 00:27:28,591
finally get a chance to meet.

692
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:31,029
<i>Henry, your dad tells me
you're in Japan for work.</i>

693
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:34,597
<i>Yeah. Some first.</i>

694
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:37,252
<i>Ben is.</i>

695
00:27:37,296 --> 00:27:38,601
Buddy, you're breaking up.

696
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,866
<i>Sorry. I gotta go. We got a call.</i>

697
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:43,519
Right, you go. You go, Bailey.

698
00:27:43,563 --> 00:27:46,783
<i>So, was that.</i>

699
00:27:46,827 --> 00:27:48,611
<i>Wait, what.</i>

700
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:51,658
Now you're frozen again,
and you're still breaking up.

701
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:52,964
Henry, can you hear me?

702
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,445
There you are.
Grey and Lopez have something.

703
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:57,751
Great.

704
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,190
- What's going on?
- Lopez figured out

705
00:28:02,234 --> 00:28:04,236
how Elijah smuggles drugs
into the country.

706
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:05,846
We were replaying the tapes from
Elijah's office,

707
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,326
and something stuck out.

708
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:09,241
Elijah said that one of his
guys, Reyes,

709
00:28:09,284 --> 00:28:11,330
was making a run to the food bank.

710
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:12,897
He doesn't seem like
the selfless type.

711
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,334
Exactly.
So we dug into his finances

712
00:28:15,377 --> 00:28:17,553
and found that he's been
making large donations

713
00:28:17,597 --> 00:28:20,252
of canned goods from a factory
in Mexico every month.

714
00:28:20,295 --> 00:28:22,297
Cans are sealed.
Dogs can't smell the drugs.

715
00:28:22,341 --> 00:28:24,560
So Elijah has his food bank
import the cans,

716
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:25,866
and then his crew distributes them

717
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:26,867
throughout the Southland.

718
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:28,173
- So, that's it.
- No.

719
00:28:28,216 --> 00:28:30,131
It's our theory.
Enough to get a warrant.

720
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,828
And Elijah's no one's fool.

721
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:34,092
He knows we heard him
reference the food bank.

722
00:28:34,135 --> 00:28:36,137
He's probably clearing
the place out as we speak.

723
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:38,357
Look, I know we're going deep
into overtime territory...

724
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,142
Screw that.
You're family. We're in.

725
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:27,972
Police! Search warrant!

726
00:29:44,423 --> 00:29:46,294
Drop it!

727
00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:47,643
It's over!

728
00:29:57,871 --> 00:29:59,264
I ain't saying nothing.

729
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:02,397
You don't have to.

730
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:05,139
We have enough to put you and
Elijah away for a long time.

731
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:10,039
Hey. Hey.

732
00:30:10,226 --> 00:30:11,584
My dad confessed
to Frank Ochoa's murder.

733
00:30:11,683 --> 00:30:12,771
- I'm typing up the report.
- Tim...

734
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:14,077
Do me a favor and call the DA.

735
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:16,340
But, Tim, stop.
Look, while you were gone,

736
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:19,848
I brought Monica
Ochoa back in. Why?

737
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:21,284
Because I knew there was
more to her story.

738
00:30:21,328 --> 00:30:24,026
You... You couldn't see past
the version

739
00:30:24,069 --> 00:30:25,549
that you wanted to see.

740
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:26,942
What'd she say?

741
00:30:41,957 --> 00:30:44,220
You brought me a present?

742
00:30:44,263 --> 00:30:47,354
Think of it more as a push.

743
00:30:58,408 --> 00:31:00,715
You didn't kill Frank.

744
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,109
Sure I did.

745
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,937
Now, come on. Cuff me.

746
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:07,504
Let's just get this over with.

747
00:31:07,548 --> 00:31:09,941
Monica confessed.

748
00:31:09,985 --> 00:31:11,813
Leave her out of this.

749
00:31:11,856 --> 00:31:13,945
Frank was beating her.

750
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:17,079
She fought back. She shot him.

751
00:31:17,122 --> 00:31:19,255
She was terrified,
so she ran to you.

752
00:31:19,298 --> 00:31:21,431
You came up with
the burglary story,

753
00:31:21,475 --> 00:31:24,216
helped her stage the house,
then you hid the gun

754
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,696
in case the cops got too close
and you needed to

755
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,959
frame someone else.

756
00:31:28,003 --> 00:31:31,528
He was a brutal, abusive bastard.

757
00:31:31,572 --> 00:31:33,487
She deserves a medal
for what she did.

758
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,359
<i>He</i> was an abusive bastard?

759
00:31:36,403 --> 00:31:40,102
What? You think I'm like him?

760
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:42,017
I was nothing like Frank.

761
00:31:43,584 --> 00:31:46,978
I taught you
what you needed to know, son.

762
00:31:47,022 --> 00:31:48,937
You're a man now because of me.

763
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,244
No. I'm who I am in spite of you.

764
00:31:52,288 --> 00:31:53,681
Oh.

765
00:31:59,469 --> 00:32:00,949
Goodbye, Dad.

766
00:32:02,777 --> 00:32:04,474
I hope it hurts.

767
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:12,221
You okay?

768
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,571
No. He was protecting her.

769
00:32:16,747 --> 00:32:19,489
He never did anything
to protect us,

770
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:23,450
but his mistress... broke half
a dozen laws for her.

771
00:32:23,493 --> 00:32:26,278
They picked her up.
She's being processed right now.

772
00:32:26,322 --> 00:32:28,629
I don't think the DA
is gonna prosecute your dad

773
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,153
on his death bed.

774
00:32:31,196 --> 00:32:32,720
Doesn't matter.

775
00:32:32,763 --> 00:32:34,548
He'll get judged soon enough.

776
00:32:37,551 --> 00:32:40,858
The Tim Tests...

777
00:32:40,902 --> 00:32:43,078
Those don't make me like him.

778
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:46,124
I know.

779
00:32:46,168 --> 00:32:48,344
You're nothing like him. I...

780
00:32:51,434 --> 00:32:53,175
Come here.

781
00:32:55,351 --> 00:32:57,222
You're nothing like him.

782
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,227
Hey.

783
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,577
How'd it go with Donovan earlier?

784
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,884
Mm. Don't ask.

785
00:33:06,928 --> 00:33:08,799
I didn't tell him. I couldn't.

786
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:10,671
That's really very sweet of you,

787
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:12,063
but he's not playing fair,

788
00:33:12,107 --> 00:33:13,369
and unless you want to
lose your kid,

789
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:15,458
you have to
start playing hardball.

790
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:17,765
Use Penelope's history
to get him to back off.

791
00:33:20,028 --> 00:33:22,509
There's no other way for me to
win this, is there?

792
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:24,467
No. Penelope's a grown woman.

793
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:26,382
She can take care of herself.

794
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:28,079
You take care of Lila.

795
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:31,300
Alright.

796
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,432
I'll call my lawyer
and tell her to use it.

797
00:33:33,476 --> 00:33:34,651
Hey.

798
00:33:34,695 --> 00:33:36,348
Judge signed off
on the warrant for Elijah.

799
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:37,306
Let's go get him.

800
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:47,272
Three blocks away.

801
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,404
Kill lights
at the next intersection.

802
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:54,497
<i>Sergeant, we just got a 911 call.</i>

803
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:56,368
<i>Multiple shots fired
at your warrant address.</i>

804
00:33:56,412 --> 00:33:57,761
Did SWAT move in early?

805
00:33:57,805 --> 00:33:59,415
<i>No, sir.
They're still two minutes out.</i>

806
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:00,982
<i>I don't know who's shooting.</i>

807
00:34:12,646 --> 00:34:14,735
Control, we don't hear gunfire,
but there's evidence of it.

808
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:17,259
Tell SWAT we're going in.

809
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,219
Police!

810
00:34:28,226 --> 00:34:29,837
What the hell happened here?

811
00:34:54,905 --> 00:34:57,081
LAPD! Come out with your hands up!

812
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:05,655
Give me your hands.

813
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:08,615
Who did this?

814
00:35:08,658 --> 00:35:10,617
Abril.

815
00:35:11,922 --> 00:35:13,445
She is not yours anymore.

816
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:14,664
No!

817
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,448
Abril's in Guatemala.

818
00:35:16,492 --> 00:35:19,364
La Fiera's cartel
fractured when she died.

819
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:23,542
No, she took control
and then came for revenge,

820
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:25,544
'cause I'm the one who told
Wesley where to find you.

821
00:35:38,775 --> 00:35:40,037
Her name is Abril Rodas.

822
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:42,518
The late La Fiera's top sicaria.

823
00:35:42,561 --> 00:35:44,346
Abril came to get revenge
on Elijah

824
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:46,348
for giving us the intel
that led to my rescue

825
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:47,741
and La Fiera's death.

826
00:35:47,784 --> 00:35:50,134
But she wasn't only here
for retribution.

827
00:35:50,178 --> 00:35:53,094
Her sicarios hit
three competing gangs

828
00:35:53,137 --> 00:35:55,183
at the same time she cut down
Elijah's crew.

829
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:57,228
They took back
all their lost territory.

830
00:35:57,272 --> 00:36:00,275
BOLOs are out for Abril,
and the DEA and FBI

831
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:02,103
are launching a joint task force.

832
00:36:02,146 --> 00:36:05,149
We will keep heightened
security precautions in place

833
00:36:05,193 --> 00:36:08,544
- for Detective Lopez and her.
- Family until Abril is caught. - Lucky me.

834
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:09,980
What are you doing here?

835
00:36:10,024 --> 00:36:11,199
Making things right.

836
00:36:11,242 --> 00:36:13,462
So, alright.
Good work today, everyone.

837
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:17,640
For those of you 20 hours into
a 12 hour shift, go home.

838
00:36:17,684 --> 00:36:20,512
You've earned the rest.

839
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:21,949
<i>So, what do you want</i>

840
00:36:21,992 --> 00:36:23,733
<i>this video to be?</i>

841
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:25,561
<i>Something embarrassing for Nolan.</i>

842
00:36:25,604 --> 00:36:27,955
<i>I can't beat the guy
on the issues.</i>

843
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:30,479
<i>He actually has a platform.</i>

844
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,046
<i>I didn't know we needed one.</i>

845
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:34,701
<i>I gotta play dirty to beat him.</i>

846
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:36,790
<i>I can't beat the guy
on the issues.</i>

847
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:38,574
<i>I gotta play dirty to beat him.</i>

848
00:36:38,617 --> 00:36:39,967
That's not me.

849
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:40,924
<i>I can't beat the guy on
the issues.</i>

850
00:36:40,968 --> 00:36:42,709
<i>I gotta play dirty to beat him.</i>

851
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:44,928
<i>I can't beat the guy
on the issues.</i>

852
00:36:44,972 --> 00:36:46,930
<i>I gotta play dirty to beat him.</i>

853
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:48,366
She said she wasn't recording.

854
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,891
There's no expectations
of privacy here.

855
00:36:50,934 --> 00:36:52,066
A good cop should know that.

856
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,284
<i>I gotta play dirty to beat him.</i>

857
00:36:53,328 --> 00:36:55,591
<i>I can't beat the guy
on the issues.</i>

858
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:03,468
Here, let me... let me help.

859
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,688
I got it.

860
00:37:05,732 --> 00:37:07,385
I'm good at cleaning things up
on my own.

861
00:37:08,865 --> 00:37:11,215
I know you are.

862
00:37:13,087 --> 00:37:16,786
I'm... I'm sorry I haven't been
here to help more.

863
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,050
Sorry I haven't been
a better big brother.

864
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:22,705
You're not that bad.

865
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:24,533
When you're around.

866
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:30,713
Well, all that changes now.

867
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:33,760
I'm coming to visit you
every holiday.

868
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:36,327
I'm gonna be calling you
at least twice a week.

869
00:37:36,371 --> 00:37:41,506
And I will handle fixing up
this place and selling it.

870
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,639
You should go home.
Be with your family.

871
00:37:45,641 --> 00:37:46,685
You're my family, too.

872
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:52,082
How about this?

873
00:37:52,126 --> 00:37:54,781
We fix and sell this place
together,

874
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:56,304
and then we'll both
be done with it.

875
00:37:58,436 --> 00:37:59,350
All of it.

876
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:03,093
Yeah.

877
00:38:07,097 --> 00:38:08,751
What ever happened with that gun?

878
00:38:16,803 --> 00:38:19,196
Hey. I'm talking to Henry.

879
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,458
- Really?
- Yeah.

880
00:38:20,502 --> 00:38:22,809
Outstanding. Hey there, buddy.

881
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:23,853
How long you guys been talking?

882
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:25,246
<i>Oh, about an hour.</i>

883
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:26,987
Has it been that long?

884
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,554
I have to go get in the shower.

885
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,035
Really nice finally
talking to you, Henry.

886
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,385
I'm going to need you to
describe that Jiro dinner

887
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:36,605
in excruciating detail
when you get home.

888
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:37,954
<i>Deal.</i>

889
00:38:37,998 --> 00:38:39,390
Oh, thank you.

890
00:38:39,434 --> 00:38:40,696
Mm. Thank you.

891
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:42,045
Bye, Henry.

892
00:38:43,525 --> 00:38:46,528
So, you guys finally
got a chance to talk.

893
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:48,443
What do you think?

894
00:38:48,486 --> 00:38:49,836
<i>I think that there's a reason
you've been trying to</i>

895
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:52,099
<i>get us to FaceTime
for the last two days.</i>

896
00:38:52,142 --> 00:38:53,187
<i>Are you proposing?</i>

897
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,189
Um, not... not yet.

898
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,408
I just wanted to make sure
you liked her,

899
00:38:57,452 --> 00:39:00,020
'cause...
things are getting serious.

900
00:39:00,063 --> 00:39:02,065
<i>Well, I'm happy for you.</i>

901
00:39:02,109 --> 00:39:04,067
<i>And when you decide to ask,</i>

902
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:07,331
<i>there are some really beautiful
venues out here in Japan.</i>

903
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,725
<i>Destination weddings
are all the rage right now.</i>

904
00:39:10,552 --> 00:39:11,640
Thank you, buddy.

905
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:12,989
<i>Arigato.</i>

906
00:39:15,513 --> 00:39:17,646
I had no idea
you would stoop this low.

907
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:18,908
Okay, hold on, hold on.

908
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:21,476
I-I tried to have
a conversation with you,

909
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:23,086
but you left me no choice.

910
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,306
I did what I thought
was best for Lila.

911
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:26,873
Congratulations.

912
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:29,092
Penelope and I broke up
and Lila is devastated.

913
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:31,486
You broke up?
That's not what I was...

914
00:39:31,529 --> 00:39:33,488
Oh, please.

915
00:39:33,531 --> 00:39:35,055
It's exactly what you wanted.

916
00:39:35,098 --> 00:39:38,362
The move is off. You won.

917
00:39:38,406 --> 00:39:40,843
Okay, look, I'm sorry,
but I did what I had to do

918
00:39:40,887 --> 00:39:42,497
to stay in my daughter's life.

919
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,760
You were doing the same thing,
digging into my past.

920
00:39:44,803 --> 00:39:47,067
Because your past has actually
harmed our daughter.

921
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:49,069
Penelope's had nothing to do
with anything.

922
00:39:49,112 --> 00:39:50,244
Then why'd you break up with her?

923
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,681
Because she didn't tell me.

924
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:56,250
And I can't be with
another woman who lies to me.

925
00:39:57,773 --> 00:39:59,470
I guess there's no telling
when we'll be rid of

926
00:39:59,514 --> 00:40:00,645
the alarm system.

927
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,169
No, but if Abril wants me dead,

928
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:03,997
I doubt that thing's
gonna stop her.

929
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,173
She killed eight armed men
by herself.

930
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,613
Hello?

931
00:40:11,656 --> 00:40:13,267
<i>Buenos días.</i>

932
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,271
Abril, where are you?

933
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:18,881
I just crossed the border.

934
00:40:18,925 --> 00:40:20,883
In 20 minutes,
I'll be on a plane back home.

935
00:40:20,927 --> 00:40:22,667
How's the baby?

936
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:24,147
None of your business.

937
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:26,497
What? You don't think
I would hurt him? Or you?

938
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:28,325
I spent my day wading through
dead bodies.

939
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:30,197
There's nothing I'd put past you.

940
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,938
Oh, no, that was just business,
you know?

941
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:33,548
Unlike La Fiera,

942
00:40:33,591 --> 00:40:38,118
<i>I kill only when it's
strategically advantageous.</i>

943
00:40:38,161 --> 00:40:40,468
But killing a police detective
and her family...

944
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:44,037
No, that is bad business,
and it will stay that way,

945
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,169
<i>unless you come after me
in Guatemala.</i>

946
00:40:46,213 --> 00:40:48,258
I'm good here. <i>Bueno.</i>

947
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:50,652
Then this is goodbye.

948
00:40:55,613 --> 00:40:58,138
So, do you see anything you like?

949
00:40:58,181 --> 00:41:00,140
Um, everything.

950
00:41:00,183 --> 00:41:02,011
I'm warning you right now,
I will be photographing

951
00:41:02,055 --> 00:41:04,231
all of our food. Go for it.

952
00:41:06,537 --> 00:41:09,627
So...

953
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:12,369
I've been thinking a lot
about us lately.

954
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:15,285
Me too.

955
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:18,071
- You're a pretty decent roommate.
- Thanks.

956
00:41:18,114 --> 00:41:21,335
And you are a super good kisser.

957
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,251
And the fact of the matter is,

958
00:41:24,294 --> 00:41:26,209
I'm in love with you.

959
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,038
Thank God.

960
00:41:29,082 --> 00:41:31,562
'Cause I'm in love with you, too.

961
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:39,179
Bailey.

962
00:41:39,222 --> 00:41:40,354
Jason.

963
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:42,356
I...

964
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,792
When did they let you out?

965
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,664
Uh, last week.

966
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:48,057
Uh, who are you?

967
00:41:48,101 --> 00:41:49,145
I'm John Nolan, her boyfriend.

968
00:41:49,189 --> 00:41:50,581
And you are?

969
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,757
Uh, her husband.
