1
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:06,745
Previously on "The Rookie"...

2
00:00:06,788 --> 00:00:08,462
Someone should really run against him. 
Lopez: You could.

3
00:00:08,486 --> 00:00:10,009
Lucy: It's Aaron Thorsen.

4
00:00:10,053 --> 00:00:11,489
TikTok famous
before he got arrested

5
00:00:11,532 --> 00:00:12,881
for murdering his roommate.

6
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:15,667
Sgt. Grey: Officer Thorsen
was found not guilty.

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,123
I've been thinking about
your arson case.

8
00:00:17,147 --> 00:00:19,801
I ran a search and found
two unsolved cases.

9
00:00:19,845 --> 00:00:21,194
Both in Nevada,

10
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:23,196
both suffered broken legs
before dying in a fire.

11
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,760
We've got a serial killer
on our hands.

12
00:00:26,721 --> 00:00:28,027
Woman: Go!

13
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,681
I can't wait to hear this story.

14
00:00:29,724 --> 00:00:31,204
This isn't what it looks like.

15
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,380
It looks like you're creating
a falling hazard

16
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:35,252
in the middle of a public park.

17
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:37,012
Yeah, that's part's exactly
what it looks like.

18
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:38,168
The question is, why?

19
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:39,691
Uh, I lost my keys?

20
00:00:39,734 --> 00:00:40,866
Sir, is this yours?

21
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,278
Yeah, actually, uh...
Can I get that back?

22
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:45,000
"If gold's your goal,
then take a stroll,

23
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:48,047
let angles point you here."

24
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,788
Sir, are you digging
for buried treasure?

25
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,747
If I say yes,
are you gonna arrest me?

26
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,880
No. Since you haven't done
any real damage

27
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:57,535
to city property,
we will cite you and let you go,

28
00:00:57,578 --> 00:00:59,841
but you need to
fill this hole back in.

29
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:02,801
Okay. Yes.
Yes, it's a treasure hunt.

30
00:01:02,844 --> 00:01:05,195
But I'm starting to think
there's no treasure down here.

31
00:01:05,238 --> 00:01:07,936
You know that says "Angel's,"
not "angles," right?

32
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:10,765
Man.

33
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:13,159
I've been digging all day!

34
00:01:13,203 --> 00:01:15,030
Whoa!

35
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,816
Does that count as...?

36
00:01:17,859 --> 00:01:20,732
Real damage? Yeah,
I'm afraid it does.

37
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:22,255
Well, I-I'll fix it.
I'll fix it!

38
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:29,306
He was wrong about the location.

39
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:31,221
That doesn't mean
the treasure map is a hoax.

40
00:01:31,264 --> 00:01:33,701
No, common sense
means the map is a hoax.

41
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:35,399
Plus, it's not even a map.
It's a poem.

42
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:36,835
Okay, you scoff,
but the Internet

43
00:01:36,878 --> 00:01:38,445
is taking this very seriously.

44
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:40,099
Mm-hmm. You want me to list

45
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:41,840
other things
the Internet takes seriously?

46
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:43,034
Point taken. I'm just saying,

47
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:44,538
it's worthy of an investigation.

48
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,149
What?!

49
00:01:46,192 --> 00:01:48,977
Smitty... I didn't think
he could stoop so low.

50
00:01:49,021 --> 00:01:51,110
You need a new slogan anyway.

51
00:01:51,154 --> 00:01:53,547
I do? Yeah, definitely.

52
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,003
And a new poster,
while you're at it.

53
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:58,291
I mean, this kind of feels
a little middle school.

54
00:01:58,335 --> 00:01:59,553
No offense, sir, but, I mean,

55
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:01,599
you need a cooler picture,
better graphics,

56
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:04,558
maybe a QR code to link
to your campaign website?

57
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:06,691
You do have
a campaign website, right?

58
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:08,814
I will as soon as you become
my new campaign manager.

59
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:11,391
Are you sure?

60
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:13,045
I mean, this is
a lot of responsibility,

61
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:14,873
and you've only known me
a few weeks.

62
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:16,222
And I'm already impressed.

63
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:19,312
Plus, you want to
tip the scales of justice,

64
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:20,531
make a difference.

65
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,402
I plan on shaking things up
around here.

66
00:02:22,446 --> 00:02:23,510
You should be a part of that.

67
00:02:23,534 --> 00:02:25,100
And you know publicity.

68
00:02:25,144 --> 00:02:26,319
Yeah, badpublicity.

69
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:28,060
That's the spirit.
Alright, I want to see

70
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:30,018
three new design ideas
by tomorrow.

71
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:31,237
Yes, sir.

72
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:37,461
Jerry McGrady. Hm.

73
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:39,593
Tim: Guy's been a cop since
E.T. phoned home.

74
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,334
Yeah.

75
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:44,119
I'm out of options on
how to assign him.

76
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:45,686
Now, I put him behind
the front desk,

77
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,212
he spends an hour with each
and every person that comes in.

78
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:50,624
Well, he's not any better
in the kit room.

79
00:02:50,648 --> 00:02:51,910
Every time he lifts a war bag,

80
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:53,172
I worry he's gonna stroke out.

81
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:54,260
He needs to retire.

82
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,262
Yes, he does.

83
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:59,787
And that's what I want you
to talk to him about.

84
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:01,243
Is that part of
my sergeant's training,

85
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:03,443
or are you trying to avoid
being a bad guy?

86
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:04,792
A little bit of both. Mm.

87
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:07,926
But, hey,
it's a difficult conversation.

88
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:10,145
No. No, it's not.

89
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,757
Look, Jerry's seen it all.
He's done it all.

90
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,125
Best thing to do
is to show him respect

91
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,281
and be straight up.

92
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:16,978
And if he pushes back,

93
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:18,608
his injury will make it easy
to retire him

94
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,243
with an involuntary disability.

95
00:03:20,286 --> 00:03:22,157
Young Mr. Thorsen.

96
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,115
How's the training going?

97
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:25,552
Great. Or terrible.

98
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:28,163
I mean, only Detective Harper
knows for sure.

99
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,078
Well, next time I see her,
I'll ask,

100
00:03:30,122 --> 00:03:32,733
and report back what she says
on the DL.

101
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:34,257
I'd appreciate that.

102
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,650
Look, I know the program
is stressful,

103
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:39,610
but I hope you're making time
for your personal life.

104
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,308
Netflix and I
are closer than ever.

105
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:44,745
Seriously,
learn from this old man.Mm-hmm.

106
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:48,227
It's easy to let the job
become your whole life.

107
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:50,490
Let me help you with that.

108
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:53,101
Thanks.

109
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:57,932
Here you go. Alright.

110
00:03:57,976 --> 00:03:58,933
Hope you don't need 'em today.

111
00:03:58,977 --> 00:03:59,977
Yeah, me too.

112
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:02,328
Tim: Jerry.

113
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:04,765
Sergeant Bradford! How ya doing?

114
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:07,377
I'm good, Jerry.
Do you have a second to talk?

115
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,769
Of course.

116
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,641
I always knew I'd be
working for you one day.

117
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,686
What you went through
in your early career

118
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,384
could've taken down
a lesser man.

119
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:15,994
But you handled everything
with grace,

120
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:17,909
like a true lawman,

121
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:20,128
and this old man's proud of you.

122
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,304
Thanks, Jerry.

123
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:22,716
So what can I get you, Sarge?
Name it.

124
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,300
Well, it's actually
what youneed, Jerry.

125
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,876
Are you sure you're okay
working kit room duty?

126
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,463
I mean, you're... you're
carrying a lot of injuries,

127
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:31,551
and I just want to make sure
you're up for

128
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:32,619
the daily aggravation.

129
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,142
I'm fine.

130
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:36,754
I get to see everyone.
I get to hear stories.

131
00:04:36,797 --> 00:04:38,886
Makes me feel like
I'm still part of it, you know?

132
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,499
Yeah. Yeah.

133
00:04:42,542 --> 00:04:44,823
Alright, look, Jerry, I'm just
gonna be straight with you.

134
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,288
What do you say
you ride with me today?

135
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:51,377
Seriously?

136
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:53,031
Uh... It would be an honor.

137
00:04:53,074 --> 00:04:55,555
Great. Uh, you get your vest on,

138
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,340
and I will see you at the shop.

139
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:01,866
How'd it go?

140
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:02,823
You're gonna want to
assign someone else

141
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:03,867
to cover the kit room.

142
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:07,262
Jerry's riding with me.

143
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,396
What happened to
the cold, hard truth?

144
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,832
I got this.

145
00:05:11,876 --> 00:05:13,636
By the end of the day,
he'll be buying a boat,

146
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,096
I promise.

147
00:05:17,577 --> 00:05:19,057
Hey.Hey.

148
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,406
Any update on
that serial killer?

149
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,061
The lab isolated the acetone
he used as an accelerant

150
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:24,932
in both fires.
It's called Instant Strip.

151
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,021
But the manufacturer
discontinued it last year.

152
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:29,067
Why? Why what?

153
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,503
Why... Why did they
discontinue it?

154
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:32,089
I used to use it all the time
when I was contracting.

155
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:33,482
I just want to make sure
I'm not gonna get cancer

156
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,595
or anything crazy, because...

157
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,075
I'm... I'll just Google that.

158
00:05:37,118 --> 00:05:38,705
What about that victim
that Harper rescued?

159
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:41,079
Last thing he remembers is
getting hit by the killer's car,

160
00:05:41,122 --> 00:05:43,037
then waking up in the hospital.

161
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:45,083
Hey.

162
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:48,149
I thought I was
coming to see you.

163
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:49,435
We were in the neighborhood.

164
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,785
John, Angela, this is
Lieutenant Fred Mitchell.

165
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,221
Nice to finally meet you.

166
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,373
I'm looking forward to
your barbecue tonight.

167
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:55,920
Yeah, it should be fun.

168
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,661
Bailey tells me you have intel

169
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,203
you want passed around
to the fire crews.

170
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:00,664
Yes.

171
00:06:00,707 --> 00:06:03,928
So far we know that our guy
is targeting ex-addicts

172
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:05,886
and he's killing them
in abandoned buildings.

173
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,671
Our operating theory
is that he scopes

174
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:08,802
the buildings out first,

175
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:10,301
but we don't know
how he targets them.

176
00:06:10,325 --> 00:06:12,197
So far, he's picked
a house in foreclosure

177
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,329
and a condemned warehouse
across the city.

178
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,114
What's the deal with
the gold watch?

179
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:18,203
Uh, that belonged
to our first victim.

180
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:20,006
It's possible the killer
took it as a trophy.

181
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:21,859
Maybe he'll leave it behind
at another fire.

182
00:06:21,902 --> 00:06:23,750
It's a long shot,
but if your people see anything,

183
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:25,123
just let us know.

184
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,385
That's all you have?

185
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:27,928
No, but it's all we're
releasing right now.

186
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,997
Well, if I lose a firefighter

187
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:31,366
because you withheld
something important,

188
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,957
I'm gonna be pissed.

189
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,281
We'll keep you in the loop
on everything you need to know.

190
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,615
Okay. Mm.

191
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,182
Fred's a good guy.

192
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:43,315
He's just a little direct
sometimes.

193
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:45,099
No problem. Hopefully the flyer

194
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:46,753
will get us a break in the case.

195
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:48,581
See you later. Thank you.

196
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,843
Okay, quick, before you go,

197
00:06:49,887 --> 00:06:51,038
uh, what can I bring tonight?

198
00:06:51,062 --> 00:06:53,368
Nothing.
Fred puts out quite a spread.

199
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,153
Thank you for saying yes, again.

200
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:56,522
I know it must feel like
you're meeting

201
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:58,852
my 10 older brothers
who will do nothing

202
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,288
but judge you all night long.

203
00:07:00,332 --> 00:07:01,464
But? There's no but.

204
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:02,987
Oh, okay.

205
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,443
Uh, I do have to bring
something, though.

206
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,120
I can't arrive empty-handed.

207
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:07,818
Fine. Bring... flowers.

208
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:08,862
Perfect. Thank you.

209
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:10,081
Flowers, I can do.

210
00:07:10,124 --> 00:07:11,996
Bye.

211
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:13,693
Hey.

212
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:14,955
Assignment change.

213
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,106
Tim is riding
with Jerry McGrady,

214
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,784
so I'm with you.

215
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,351
Kit Room McGrady? Why?

216
00:07:19,394 --> 00:07:20,744
I'm past the point of asking.

217
00:07:20,787 --> 00:07:22,330
Okay, well, no. That's good.
That's great, actually.

218
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:23,897
I can tell you all about
the treasure map we found...

219
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:27,751
Treasure poem
that we found... puzzle?

220
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:29,840
First thing we do,
we decide what to call it.

221
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,757
That used to be a Woolworth's.

222
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,082
And right there,
that's the first place

223
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,499
I ever got stabbed.

224
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:38,172
How many times were you wounded
in the line of duty?

225
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:39,632
21.

226
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:42,374
Nine stabbings, two gunshots,
four broken bones,

227
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:45,682
three teeth knocked out,
and two torn hamstrings.

228
00:07:45,725 --> 00:07:46,900
That's, uh... That's 20.

229
00:07:47,945 --> 00:07:49,381
Right.

230
00:07:49,424 --> 00:07:51,165
Food poisoning, 2007.

231
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,993
Last time I let Smitty
pick a restaurant.

232
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,259
You know,
all that wear and tear...

233
00:07:58,303 --> 00:08:00,499
Gotta make it hard to put
the duty belt on in the morning.

234
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:03,047
It's a righteous pain.

235
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,744
Dispatch: Control, 7-Adam-47.

236
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:06,746
We are Code 4
on the barking dogs.

237
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,879
That guy sounds like

238
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,315
Junior Gamez. You remember him?

239
00:08:10,358 --> 00:08:11,882
Junior. Yeah.

240
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,445
You, uh... You still
in touch with him?

241
00:08:14,188 --> 00:08:15,625
Ah, not since he died.

242
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:19,019
What about, uh...
What is it... Buddy Kepler?

243
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:20,151
Yeah, I remember Buddy.

244
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:22,762
He was just, uh...
Oh, he was nuts.

245
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,459
What about his...
Buddy's brother Frank?

246
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,460
He was even worse.

247
00:08:25,504 --> 00:08:27,419
Yeah.

248
00:08:27,462 --> 00:08:31,336
Buddy passed in '09.
Frank, 2014.

249
00:08:33,338 --> 00:08:35,253
Oh, man.

250
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:36,950
It's great being out
on the streets again.

251
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:43,130
Hey, I gotta wait for
my client in lockup to sober up

252
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,915
before they can question her.

253
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,481
Wanna grab lunch? I can't.

254
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:49,223
I inherited a case from Burns
that goes to trial next week,

255
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:50,094
and I need to start prepping.

256
00:08:50,137 --> 00:08:51,704
Hmm.

257
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:53,924
I've never been to court
for a case that wasn't mine.

258
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,622
And Burns can't fly in
from New Mexico for the trial?

259
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,755
I called.
She yelled, "I'm retired,"

260
00:08:58,798 --> 00:09:00,539
and hung up.

261
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:02,256
But if you're free later,
it would be great

262
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,717
if you could walk me through
a cross-examination.

263
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:06,676
Sure. I'll go easy on you.

264
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:07,783
Hell no. Put me on the stand.

265
00:09:07,807 --> 00:09:08,808
Give me your worst.

266
00:09:08,852 --> 00:09:10,984
Oh, you can't handle my worst.

267
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:12,725
Bring it, pretty boy.

268
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:13,944
What do you think of roses?

269
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,138
They're a little predictable,

270
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:17,730
but a timeless symbol
of love and romance.

271
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,689
Wait, is it Bailey's birthday
or something?

272
00:09:19,732 --> 00:09:20,951
No, they're not for her.

273
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,779
Uh, her boss is having
a barbecue tonight.

274
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:24,911
Okay.
I should bring something else?

275
00:09:24,955 --> 00:09:27,348
I mean,
to a firefighter's house?

276
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:29,133
Yeah. Beer.

277
00:09:29,176 --> 00:09:30,351
Ahh.

278
00:09:30,395 --> 00:09:32,876
And someone put a lot
of effort into this,

279
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:36,053
although the rhyme scheme
is a little loose.

280
00:09:36,096 --> 00:09:39,752
"If gold's your goal,
then take a stroll,

281
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:42,581
let angles point you here."

282
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:45,497
The guy we arrested thought it
said "angels," not "angles."

283
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,542
He won't be the last one
to make that mistake,

284
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:51,242
although "angle" isn't
necessarily a noun.

285
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:54,375
Oh. Uh. Uh, uh, uh!

286
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:56,639
The Santa Monica Pier.
That's our first stop.

287
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:57,814
How do you know that?

288
00:09:57,857 --> 00:09:59,095
Just trust me!
We gotta head over there.

289
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:01,687
Okay, but if we find
the money, I get half.

290
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:03,558
Of the zero dollars
we'll be allowed to keep?

291
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,125
Yeah, deal. Ooh!

292
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:07,998
I think this line refers to

293
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,043
one of those coin-operated
viewfinders.

294
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,479
You might want to intervene.

295
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:13,525
They've tapped into
their inner Neanderthals.

296
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:15,285
Woman: Out of my way!
Man: I was here first!

297
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:16,397
Whoa! Hey, police!

298
00:10:16,441 --> 00:10:17,703
Woman: No!

299
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:21,751
Hands on the rails.

300
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:24,057
Control, 7-Adam-15,
send an RA to our location.

301
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:26,581
Victim's a woman, 30s,
impalement to her chest.

302
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,279
She's not conscious,
not breathing.

303
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,939
This poem was posted on Reddit
two days ago,

304
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:37,307
and it's the reason why
a young mother

305
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:38,768
is laying
in the morgue right now.

306
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:39,769
Uh, people are only gonna
get crazier

307
00:10:39,812 --> 00:10:40,813
hunting for the treasure.

308
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,293
So Nolan was right.

309
00:10:42,336 --> 00:10:44,184
I'm sorry, if you say that
again, I can record it.

310
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,707
People actually think that
this will lead them

311
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:47,124
to buried treasure?

312
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:50,344
Yes, because Stuart Packer
claims to be the author.

313
00:10:50,388 --> 00:10:51,737
Why does that name
sound familiar?

314
00:10:51,781 --> 00:10:54,435
He pulled the Joseph & Wells
robbery back in '03.

315
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,568
Ronnie Wick was
the lead detective.

316
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:59,266
I was there when they brought
Stuart in, the little snot.

317
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,312
He wouldn't tell us where
he hid the gold coins.

318
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:02,574
Gold coins?

319
00:11:02,617 --> 00:11:05,098
Yeah. Nearly $2 mil worth.

320
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,752
Sgt. Grey:
We never recovered the coins.

321
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:07,971
The city's losing its mind.

322
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:09,383
I mean, w-we're getting
flooded with calls

323
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:10,863
of people climbing
the Hollywood sign,

324
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,105
diving into Echo Park Lake.

325
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,325
Alright, we need
to find this gold

326
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:17,545
and to end the chaos
as quickly as possible.

327
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,592
Now, Chen, you deciphered
the first clue.

328
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:22,202
How'd you do it?

329
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:25,075
Well, i-it... it first clicked
when I realized that

330
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:28,165
"angle" could mean "fishhook."

331
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,210
The pier is
a favorite fishing point,

332
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:31,995
and fisherman are also
called anglers.

333
00:11:32,038 --> 00:11:33,344
Nerd. What?

334
00:11:33,387 --> 00:11:35,191
Don't let him shame you.
That was a great catch.

335
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:36,303
Thank you, Jerry.Okay.

336
00:11:36,347 --> 00:11:37,827
What about the rest
of the stanza?

337
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,961
Uh, "Next find the lens
thru which you'll spy"

338
00:11:42,005 --> 00:11:44,529
the West Coast's greatest view."

339
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:48,228
I mean, the lens is obviously
the viewfinder at the pier.

340
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:49,752
Yes, and, uh, um,
this next line,

341
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:52,058
"The fee you pay," refers to
the fee of the viewfinder,

342
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:53,799
which is 75 cents,

343
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:57,237
so we just need to change 75
into a-a year.

344
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,936
But what century?
That could be 1775...

345
00:11:59,979 --> 00:12:02,373
It's 1975.
It's the Year of the Rabbit.

346
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,505
Call me a nerd. I dare you.

347
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,899
Well, uh, the poem states,
"The fee you pay becomes

348
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,945
the year of Rabbit minus two,"

349
00:12:08,988 --> 00:12:12,600
so 1975 minus 2 is 1973.

350
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:13,993
Okay, okay, okay.

351
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,560
What does it mean?

352
00:12:15,603 --> 00:12:18,258
1973 could be
the combination of a safe,

353
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:19,869
uh, the number of
a storage locker.

354
00:12:19,912 --> 00:12:21,261
Uh, it's not gonna make sense

355
00:12:21,305 --> 00:12:22,828
until we solve
the second stanza.

356
00:12:22,872 --> 00:12:24,264
The third stanza says that,

357
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:25,589
once we put
those two clues together,

358
00:12:25,613 --> 00:12:27,224
we will find the gold.

359
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:29,922
Harper and Chen, I'm putting you
in charge of solving this.

360
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:32,359
Uh, sir. I have been known to

361
00:12:32,403 --> 00:12:35,623
solve a Timescrossword, uh,
once or twice in my day.

362
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:36,905
Well, I'm sure
they'll let you tag along

363
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:39,366
if you ask nicely, Nolan.

364
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,431
Thorsen, you're riding with me
the rest of the shift.

365
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:43,849
Everyone, be vigilant out there.

366
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:49,246
Hey, uh, you guys want in
on this task force?

367
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:51,422
'Cause I can make that happen.

368
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:53,946
Cute. But Jerry and I,
we're gonna solve this

369
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,271
with good, old-fashioned
police work,

370
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:57,167
not literary analysis.

371
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,690
Damn straight.

372
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:02,172
I'd love another shot at Stuart,
smug little bastard.

373
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,915
Care for a friendly wager...
Who finds the treasure first?

374
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,481
You're on.

375
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:09,266
If we find it first,

376
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:12,225
you have to stay quiet in
the shop for an entire shift.

377
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:15,620
Okay, uh, and if we win,
you have to do something

378
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:19,015
completely out of
your comfort zone... my choice.

379
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,148
Enjoy your little poetry club.

380
00:13:22,192 --> 00:13:24,847
Enjoy reviewing 18-year-old
evidence from a cold case.

381
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,761
I hear those
are super easy to crack.

382
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,242
Do you honestly think that
my client murdered his wife

383
00:13:29,286 --> 00:13:30,437
and then stuck around
waiting to get caught?

384
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,810
It's not about what I believe.

385
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:34,291
The facts are that he was
holding the murder weapon

386
00:13:34,334 --> 00:13:35,945
in his hand
when officers arrived.

387
00:13:35,988 --> 00:13:38,556
Cops have a saying, don't they?

388
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:39,818
"The husband always did it."

389
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,254
Everyone has that saying.

390
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:43,735
Right, so you and all
the officers working on the case

391
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:44,973
went in assuming
my client's guilt.

392
00:13:44,997 --> 00:13:46,303
That's not fair.

393
00:13:46,346 --> 00:13:48,522
I agree.
Police bias is never fair.

394
00:13:48,566 --> 00:13:51,264
Did you even bother
looking for another suspect?

395
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:52,851
I mean, the victim's
estranged business partner

396
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,093
didn't have an alibi.

397
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:56,139
The business partner
wasn't found at the scene

398
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:57,899
holding the gun. Well, according
to my client,

399
00:13:57,923 --> 00:13:58,881
in his panic,
seeing his dead wife,

400
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:00,578
he picked up the murder weapon.

401
00:14:00,621 --> 00:14:02,928
Did you even bother checking
the second layer of prints?

402
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:05,017
Of course. Came back no match.

403
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:07,802
And did you run the prints
both orientations?

404
00:14:13,983 --> 00:14:16,724
No, Detective Burns did not.

405
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:19,336
I need to go run those prints.
Thanks for helping.

406
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:20,685
I wasn't too hard on you, was I?

407
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,382
Part of me wanted to slap you...

408
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:24,123
The other wanted
to jump your bones.

409
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:28,040
Oh, me too. God, I love us.

410
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:31,783
Who knew people would go
so mental over buried treasure?

411
00:14:32,566 --> 00:14:34,220
Clearly, you did, Stuart.

412
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:37,223
And the question is,
why start a treasure hunt?

413
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:38,940
Are you really looking
to give away your stash,

414
00:14:38,964 --> 00:14:40,923
or you just trying to
get on the news?

415
00:14:40,966 --> 00:14:42,335
They've been talking about me
all morning.

416
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,708
It's pretty cool.

417
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,797
Wish they'd use
a better picture, though.

418
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,365
Did you see that a woman was
killed because of your poem?

419
00:14:48,408 --> 00:14:49,603
But that wasn't part
of the plan.

420
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:51,020
That was just a fun bonus.

421
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:53,631
Yeah, you pretend to be a tough
guy, Stuart... Mm.

422
00:14:53,674 --> 00:14:55,514
But Ronnie Wick told me
you wept like a baby

423
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:56,808
when he put the cuffs on you.

424
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:59,811
Yeah, your buddy's full of crap.

425
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:02,422
Drove him nuts I never gave up
where the gold was,

426
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:03,815
didn't it?

427
00:15:03,858 --> 00:15:05,512
Oh, I heard he kicked it
a few years back.

428
00:15:05,556 --> 00:15:07,819
That sucks he never got
that closure.

429
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,432
Look, Stuart, you got
your thrills, alright?

430
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:16,436
Now I can get you upgraded
to the nicest cell in here.

431
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,004
Maybe even get the DA to knock
a few years off your sentence.

432
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,288
Just tell us where the gold is.

433
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:23,617
Sure.

434
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,141
Give me something to write on.

435
00:15:39,546 --> 00:15:41,896
Here's where I hid it.

436
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,683
The DA can always
add a few years, too.

437
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:48,599
Oh, you don't know, do you?

438
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:52,559
I'm terminal. Pancreatic cancer.

439
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:54,648
Mm. Karma's a cruel mistress.

440
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,825
When they denied my request
for a compassionate release,

441
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:02,047
I realized I'd never get to
spend my hidden fortune,

442
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,832
so I decided to
let chaos rain down

443
00:16:04,876 --> 00:16:06,965
on the City of Angels.

444
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,882
Guard. All done here.

445
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:21,893
Jerry.

446
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:23,740
You weren't just around
when Stuart got arrested...

447
00:16:23,764 --> 00:16:25,592
You were friends with
the lead detective.

448
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:27,701
Look, I want to take you down
to the scene of the robbery.

449
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:29,529
I want you to walk me through
everything you remember

450
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,834
about the crime, even what
the city looked like back then.

451
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:37,082
Jerry: This is it...
Joseph & Wells Rare Coins.

452
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:38,605
At least, it used to be.

453
00:16:40,129 --> 00:16:42,870
Alright, so Stuart pulls up
in a stolen getaway car,

454
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:45,960
parks there, goes in,
grabs the gold,

455
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,701
comes out,
jumps back in his car.

456
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:50,052
It doesn't start,
so he flees on foot.

457
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:53,794
We apprehended him 12 hours
later near Western and Melrose.

458
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,381
Even if Stuart was on foot
the whole time,

459
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:58,016
he could have covered
quite a bit of ground.

460
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,237
Now, the original search grid
has him going west.

461
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,718
Because 90% of suspects turn
right when exiting a building.

462
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,940
Oh, man.

463
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:11,203
I think Ronnie messed up
back then.

464
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:14,119
Today, when Stuart wrote
"up your ass,"

465
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:16,078
he used his left hand.

466
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:17,664
Meaning it was more likely
Stuart went left

467
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:19,081
after the robbery.Yeah.

468
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:21,953
The original search grid
was way off. Let's go.

469
00:17:21,996 --> 00:17:23,389
Lucy: Oh, dammit.

470
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:24,584
Tim just texted me.
Him and Jerry just had

471
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:25,957
a big breakthrough.

472
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,369
Oh, he's just trying to
get in your head.

473
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:29,178
Ignore him. I agree. Focus.

474
00:17:29,221 --> 00:17:32,616
"Watch the Stars of Hollywood
influence from their spheres."

475
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:34,705
Stars of Hollywood.
What... What are we thinking?

476
00:17:34,748 --> 00:17:37,099
Can't be movie stars.
That's too obvious.

477
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:39,449
"A monument to Rebels gone."

478
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:41,451
Are they dead? Is it a cemetery?

479
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:44,149
The Forest Lawn Cemetery?
They do mention "lawn."

480
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:46,499
Okay, well, we have "monuments,"
"dead Rebels,"

481
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,153
and "darkness' edge."

482
00:17:48,197 --> 00:17:49,477
That... That could be
a cemetery.

483
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,765
Yeah, but what about
these spheres?

484
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,898
Uh, where are they
influencing from?

485
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:56,683
The... The heavens? The stars?

486
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,207
Oh, wait, that's it.

487
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,037
Stars, spheres,
celestial objects, heavens.

488
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:04,276
Griffith Observatory. Griffith Observatory.

489
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,171
Yes, and the Observatory
was in the movie

490
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,607
"Rebel Without a Cause."

491
00:18:07,651 --> 00:18:10,610
They even have a bust
of James Dean's head up there.

492
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:13,135
Alright, the rest,
we can decipher later.

493
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:14,590
Wait, wait. Hold on.
I gotta text Tim and tell him

494
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:16,312
we are about to kick his ass.

495
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:18,313
Huh. Ah.

496
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,675
James Dean's bust
is just up this way.

497
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,547
Officers.

498
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:37,811
Looks like we need
to up our game.

499
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:40,684
Seriously.

500
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:42,512
Gotta be in it to win it.

501
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,991
Woman:

502
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:46,559
He's got a bomb!

503
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:49,083
Hey!

504
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,172
Hey, stop!

505
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:52,826
Stop right there!

506
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:57,004
I know this looks bad,

507
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,963
but if you'll just let me
blow up that wall,

508
00:18:59,006 --> 00:19:00,269
I can finally prove to my wife

509
00:19:00,312 --> 00:19:01,550
that I was right about
something.

510
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:04,577
Sir, you need to drop
the bomb right now!

511
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:07,232
Guys, chill!
I know what I'm doing.

512
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:09,929
Ohh!

513
00:19:25,032 --> 00:19:27,010
These damn treasure hunters
are packing dynamite now?

514
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,471
The deceased is
a special case, sir!

515
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:29,602
Why are you yelling?

516
00:19:29,646 --> 00:19:31,300
I'm sorry. Uh, uh, my ears.

517
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:33,127
The explosion was loud.

518
00:19:33,171 --> 00:19:35,260
Uh, the deceased had access
to demolitions

519
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:36,957
because of his job
at a quarry in Oregon.

520
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,221
They're coming all the way
from Oregon?

521
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:41,223
That's it. We need to
lock down this location,

522
00:19:41,266 --> 00:19:43,573
cut off access
to any more gold seekers.

523
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,836
Now, how close are you guys
to figuring out the poem?

524
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:47,664
We're at a bit of
an impasse, sir.

525
00:19:47,707 --> 00:19:50,014
The second stanza states
that the next clue

526
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:52,146
is only visible in
early morning light.

527
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,540
The longer this goes on,
the more dangerous it becomes.

528
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,716
Look, I need the gold found.

529
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,041
Aaron: So, I need y'all to
stand back, okay?

530
00:19:58,065 --> 00:19:58,979
Stay back. Stay back.

531
00:19:59,023 --> 00:20:01,591
Thank you for your service.

532
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,028
Sorry. I know
that's usually for the military.

533
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:06,857
I just, uh... It's just,
I appreciate you guys.

534
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,859
And I know you don't usually
get to hear it.

535
00:20:08,902 --> 00:20:11,340
No, uh, thank you.
That... That means a lot.

536
00:20:11,383 --> 00:20:14,081
I'm Cleo, uh, Officer Thorsen.

537
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:15,474
Aaron.

538
00:20:15,518 --> 00:20:16,518
Nice to meet you.

539
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,652
Can I buy you dinner?

540
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:22,046
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

541
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:23,850
I should not be bothering you.
That just slipped out.

542
00:20:23,874 --> 00:20:25,615
No, no, no, no. No, no. Uh...

543
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:29,227
D-Dinner sounds good.
Um, but it's on me.

544
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,576
Actually...

545
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,144
can I get your number?

546
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:34,798
Yeah.

547
00:20:37,322 --> 00:20:39,019
Text me later. Yeah, for sure.

548
00:20:40,586 --> 00:20:42,936
Well, congratulations.

549
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,721
You just had your first contact

550
00:20:44,764 --> 00:20:46,418
with a "badge bunny." A what?

551
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,159
A woman who is attracted to
the uniform,

552
00:20:48,202 --> 00:20:49,465
only dates cops.

553
00:20:49,508 --> 00:20:51,641
So, I recognize her.

554
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:54,687
She dumped Officer Haspel
a month ago,

555
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:57,124
Sergeant Daffern in May,

556
00:20:57,168 --> 00:21:01,346
and Officer Williams,
I believe, a year ago.

557
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,000
That's a relief.

558
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:04,586
I thought maybe she had, like,
a podcast or something

559
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,786
and was only interested in me
'cause of my past.

560
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,874
Thanks.

561
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:09,528
Jerry: What's the plan
for tomorrow?

562
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:12,009
Yeah, look, about that, uh...

563
00:21:12,052 --> 00:21:13,010
We need to have
a conversation, Jer...

564
00:21:13,053 --> 00:21:14,272
Hey, Dad.

565
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:17,231
Hey, what are you doing here?

566
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:19,364
Your car's in the shop,
remember?

567
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,887
You asked me to pick you up.

568
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:23,934
Right. Sorry.
It's been a busy day.

569
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:26,153
This is my daughter... Ashley.

570
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:27,807
Tim Bradford. Nice to meet you.

571
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:31,158
He's been texting me
all day about you.

572
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:34,379
It really meant a lot to him
to be back out on the street.

573
00:21:36,947 --> 00:21:38,905
Would you like to join us
for dinner,

574
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:40,820
as a "thank you" for today?

575
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:43,301
I couldn't.

576
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:44,868
Yeah, you can.

577
00:21:44,911 --> 00:21:47,566
My daughter makes
a mean take-out,

578
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,741
just like her old man.

579
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:54,530
Sure. Yeah, sounds nice.

580
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,407
I told you to bring flowers.

581
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:04,148
Yeah, I know.
How'd you know I was here?

582
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:05,932
I went to get napkins.
I saw you pull up.

583
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:07,717
Hey, John.
Glad you could make it.

584
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,936
Thanks. I brought beer.

585
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,678
Actually,
this is a sober gathering.

586
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,162
A couple of the guys
are in recovery,

587
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:17,204
and we decided as a family
to honor their struggle.

588
00:22:17,248 --> 00:22:18,684
That is very thoughtful

589
00:22:18,728 --> 00:22:20,860
and probably why Bailey
suggested I bring flowers.

590
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:22,949
Well, I do love flowers.

591
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,690
I'm just gonna put this
in the truck.

592
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:26,910
Appreciate it.

593
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,612
Okay, we have until
dawn tomorrow

594
00:22:33,656 --> 00:22:36,659
to figure out this next passage,
but no pressure.

595
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:38,138
Okay, look.

596
00:22:38,182 --> 00:22:39,749
"A monument to Rebels."

597
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,534
That's plural, so it can't
just mean James Dean.

598
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:45,276
What other statues are nearby?

599
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:46,712
Okay, there's one
on the front lawn

600
00:22:46,756 --> 00:22:48,845
of six prominent astronomers.

601
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:50,499
I mean,
scientists ahead of their time

602
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:52,588
could be see as rebels.

603
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:55,547
Is one of them Sir Isaac Newton?

604
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,680
Yeah. What...
What are you thinking?

605
00:22:57,723 --> 00:22:59,812
Uh, "Follow in
a great man's path",

606
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:01,858
his First Law as your guide."

607
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:03,207
So we start at Newton's statue.

608
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,078
And follow his path
in a straight line.

609
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:07,037
"Until darkness' edge you find."

610
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,300
What... So we walk
until we hit darkness?

611
00:23:09,343 --> 00:23:11,433
A shadow.

612
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:13,367
That's why we have to start
at early morning light...

613
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,133
Otherwise the shadow
won't be in the right place.

614
00:23:16,176 --> 00:23:17,482
Ooh! There it is.

615
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:20,311
You know, riding with you today

616
00:23:20,354 --> 00:23:22,356
was the highlight of Dad's year.

617
00:23:23,575 --> 00:23:25,708
Hell, his last five years.

618
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,361
Yeah, I don't get it.

619
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,059
Most cops who stay on the job
this long,

620
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:31,061
they don't have anything else
waiting for them,

621
00:23:31,104 --> 00:23:32,544
but I'm sure you'd love to
be able to

622
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:33,933
spend more time with him.

623
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:36,675
Mm, because I've got nothing
going on in my own life?

624
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:37,913
No, no. That's...
That's not what I meant.

625
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:40,505
Relax. It's a joke.

626
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:42,986
No one ever gets my jokes.

627
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:45,031
I guess I'm just used to
jokes being funny.

628
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,475
I-I guess that's why
I got confused.

629
00:23:50,646 --> 00:23:52,996
Honestly, I think my dad regrets

630
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,737
not retiring 15 years ago

631
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,521
when he was still on the street.

632
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,568
Like all his buddies did.

633
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,097
Comin' in hot.

634
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,968
Thank you.Yeah.

635
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:10,492
Oh. Hey, Bailey.
Good to see you.

636
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:12,363
Hey, Marcus.
This is my boyfriend, John.

637
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:13,582
Hey, nice to meet you.

638
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,539
And you. Hey.

639
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,801
John's a cop.

640
00:24:15,845 --> 00:24:18,543
Oh. Oh. That is impressive.

641
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:20,632
He's very impressive, isn't he?

642
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:21,720
Thank you for that.Mm-hmm.

643
00:24:21,764 --> 00:24:23,026
And how to you fit in here?

644
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,723
Oh, I just, uh, live
across the street.

645
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,812
Marcus is the best neighbor.

646
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,553
Whenever I'm at the station
for a stretch,

647
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:29,989
he keeps an eye on my place...

648
00:24:30,033 --> 00:24:32,470
Waters my plants,
eats all my ice cream.

649
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,993
Okay, that happened one time

650
00:24:34,037 --> 00:24:35,560
and I will never
hear the end of it.

651
00:24:35,604 --> 00:24:37,301
He ran off to Nevada
over the summer

652
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:38,607
for, like, two weeks.

653
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:41,871
He left his fridge full
of chocolate mint fudge.

654
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,655
What am I supposed to do?

655
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:45,831
That sounds like
extenuating circumstances.

656
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,592
I'm sorry. I don't think
a jury would convict.

657
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,661
Hey, you're low on ice.

658
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,055
Uh, there's more in
the garage fridge.

659
00:24:52,098 --> 00:24:53,143
I'll go grab it.

660
00:24:53,186 --> 00:24:54,318
Thanks.

661
00:25:17,471 --> 00:25:19,038
Hey.

662
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:21,040
The re-orientated print
came back as a match

663
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:22,433
to the business partner.

664
00:25:22,476 --> 00:25:23,869
Burns arrested the wrong man.

665
00:25:23,913 --> 00:25:24,827
Yes!

666
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,568
See, I knew that guy was fishy.

667
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:29,788
Wait. Did I just exonerate...

668
00:25:29,832 --> 00:25:31,442
We.

669
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:34,619
Did we just exonerate a man
who wasn't even my client?

670
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:35,968
I knew I was good, but damn.

671
00:25:38,492 --> 00:25:40,799
Nolan, what's up?

672
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:42,409
I'm at
Bailey's lieutenant's house

673
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:44,977
and I just stumbled upon
a case of acetone

674
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,589
just like the kind
our arsonist uses.

675
00:25:47,632 --> 00:25:49,329
Lots of people use it. Yeah, I know.

676
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,854
But I just found out
that Fred here

677
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:53,420
was in Nevada over the summer.

678
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,137
Do you know what month?
'Cause if we can put him there

679
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:57,033
at the time of
the second Nevada murder...

680
00:25:57,076 --> 00:25:59,209
He didn't say.
I can try and find out.

681
00:25:59,252 --> 00:26:00,665
Would that be enough
to get a warrant?

682
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:01,864
No. We're gonna need more.

683
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:03,189
We'll need to do a deep dive
on this guy,

684
00:26:03,213 --> 00:26:05,171
find something beyond
circumstantial evidence.

685
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:07,391
Okay. And what should I do?

686
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:09,001
Do about what?

687
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:10,916
Uh... I'll call you back.

688
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,961
Hey, there.

689
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,572
I was, uh...
Just grabbing the ice.

690
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:17,053
Do about what?

691
00:26:17,096 --> 00:26:18,228
Oh, nothing.

692
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:20,143
John, why are you lying to me?

693
00:26:26,105 --> 00:26:29,543
Alright, so here is
the "great man,"

694
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,371
Sir Isaac Newton.

695
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:33,765
Lucy: And his path along
the shadow.

696
00:26:33,809 --> 00:26:35,593
And then what?

697
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,595
The Ancho family.

698
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:38,814
Who are they?

699
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:47,344
Cover it.

700
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:51,914
So much for no one
having the next clue besides us.

701
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:55,918
I know Fred. He's not a killer.

702
00:26:55,961 --> 00:26:58,398
He spent all yesterday
handing out those flyers,

703
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:00,749
talking to other lieutenants
at other houses,

704
00:27:00,792 --> 00:27:02,185
asking them to spread the word.

705
00:27:02,228 --> 00:27:04,404
Does that sound like
the actions of a guilty man?

706
00:27:04,448 --> 00:27:06,668
It doesn't, but there's enough
circumstantial evidence

707
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:08,365
to warrant an investigation.

708
00:27:08,408 --> 00:27:11,324
Because he was in Nevada
this summer or owns acetone?

709
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:13,675
Which he uses for woodworking,
by the way.

710
00:27:13,718 --> 00:27:15,285
I know this is hard.

711
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,157
If he's innocent, then we can
eliminate him as a suspect,

712
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:20,222
and then we'll just be
that much closer to the truth.

713
00:27:20,246 --> 00:27:22,379
I know you're doing your jobs.
I get it.

714
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:26,035
Just do it fast, okay?
I gotta get to work.

715
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:29,081
You can't breathe a word of this
to Fred or anyone else.

716
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,561
I won't.

717
00:27:33,738 --> 00:27:36,175
Okay. Tell me what you think.

718
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:37,655
For some variety, I went in

719
00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:39,099
two completely different
directions.

720
00:27:39,135 --> 00:27:41,703
Those are amazing!
I love them both!

721
00:27:41,746 --> 00:27:43,966
Huge improvement.
Yours were terrible.

722
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:45,794
That's fair. This is...
Can I have a copy

723
00:27:45,837 --> 00:27:47,206
of each of those,
one to send to my son?

724
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,642
Yeah. You give me the go-ahead
and I'll print up 100.

725
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,842
Absolutely. Go ahead.

726
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:53,715
Sergeant Grey said you had
an assignment for me?

727
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:56,195
This is my suspect,
Fred Mitchell.

728
00:27:56,239 --> 00:27:58,173
Get a good look. You're
gonna hunt for him online.

729
00:27:58,197 --> 00:27:59,982
Easy. Don't get cocky.

730
00:28:00,025 --> 00:28:01,810
Fred has
no social media footprint.

731
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:04,160
But most of his friends
and coworkers do,

732
00:28:04,203 --> 00:28:06,553
so use them to document
everywhere he's been,

733
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:08,033
especially last summer.

734
00:28:08,077 --> 00:28:10,340
Well, where the hell
did he stash the gold?!

735
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:12,187
Uh, we'll figure it out,
alright? Our plan is solid.

736
00:28:12,211 --> 00:28:13,865
We'll cross-reference
our new search grid

737
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:15,800
with every location in that file
until we find it.

738
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:17,173
I don't know.

739
00:28:17,216 --> 00:28:20,176
It's gonna take
a lot of days, Sarge.

740
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:23,353
A cop like me doesn't have
many of those left.

741
00:28:23,396 --> 00:28:25,790
Yeah, about that...

742
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:27,202
We need to have
a frank conversation.

743
00:28:27,226 --> 00:28:28,662
Get the hell out of here.

744
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:30,621
Excuse me?

745
00:28:30,664 --> 00:28:31,840
I know where the gold is.

746
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:35,757
Wait, for real? You sure?

747
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,975
Absolutely.

748
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:38,542
Oho! We are gonna win this bet.

749
00:28:42,111 --> 00:28:44,156
So, the Ancho family...
Who are they?

750
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,767
Harper: Not sure,
but the next step

751
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,986
is to put the first clue
with the second, so these...

752
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,075
Sorry, guys.
I have to take this.

753
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,470
Hey. I checked
Fred's work schedule.

754
00:28:53,513 --> 00:28:54,645
Bailey.

755
00:28:54,688 --> 00:28:57,039
I know, but it was easy to do
and no risk.

756
00:28:57,082 --> 00:28:58,475
And what did you find out?

757
00:28:58,518 --> 00:29:00,627
He was on vacation when
the murder in Nevada occurred,

758
00:29:00,651 --> 00:29:01,608
but that doesn't mean anything.

759
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:03,045
I will tell Lopez.

760
00:29:03,088 --> 00:29:04,263
Then what?

761
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:05,917
Then about a thousand
other steps.

762
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:10,052
Investigations take time
and paperwork and patience.

763
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:11,053
What kind of evidence
do you need

764
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:12,445
to get a warrant for his house?

765
00:29:12,489 --> 00:29:15,057
Something that would give us
his exact location...

766
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,190
Receipts, uh,
credit card statements.

767
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:20,105
Okay, I gotta go.
I'll talk to you later.

768
00:29:20,149 --> 00:29:22,325
Alright. Thank you.

769
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:23,413
Everything okay?

770
00:29:23,456 --> 00:29:25,850
Yeah, I hope so. Where are we?

771
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:28,940
No one in the Ancho family died
or was born in 1973.

772
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:30,507
Okay, then what if
it's not a year?

773
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,380
What if it's an address?
1973 Ancho Street.

774
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:35,729
Well, wait.

775
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:39,733
It says in the poem,
the two clues "translate."

776
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:44,564
Ancho means "width" in Spanish,
so wide, deep, broad.

777
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:47,132
Uh, 1973 Broad Street.

778
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:49,096
That's, uh... That's right here.
That's downtown.

779
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,050
It's a dress shop.

780
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:56,185
"If you seek true happiness,
you must look within."

781
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:57,553
Does the dress shop
have a basement?

782
00:29:57,577 --> 00:29:58,840
Um...

783
00:29:58,883 --> 00:30:00,363
Oh, uh... The Red Car.

784
00:30:00,406 --> 00:30:02,191
It's the original subway
in Los Angeles,

785
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:03,583
built in the 1920s.

786
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:04,907
It's right underneath that shop.

787
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,376
Nolan: Wow.

788
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:15,900
I never even knew
this place existed.

789
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:18,772
It's been shut down
since the '50s.

790
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:20,185
Harper: It's a perfect place
to stash gold.

791
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,427
Mm.

792
00:30:21,471 --> 00:30:23,690
Man: I got here first.
That gold is mine.

793
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:24,929
Man #2: Do you think solving
the poem is the only way

794
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:26,041
to find the gold?

795
00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:27,303
You... I saw you.

796
00:30:27,346 --> 00:30:29,044
You were at the Observatory...

797
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:30,088
Behind me.

798
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:31,394
All the better to find you.

799
00:30:31,437 --> 00:30:32,458
You thought you could just
follow me here

800
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:33,700
and steal my treasure?

801
00:30:33,744 --> 00:30:35,441
All's fair in
love and gold, my man.

802
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:37,095
Now tell me where
the treasure is

803
00:30:37,139 --> 00:30:38,333
or you're dying in this tunnel.

804
00:30:38,357 --> 00:30:40,664
Dude, you brought a shovel
to a gun fight.

805
00:30:47,323 --> 00:30:49,064
Nolan! Stay with him!

806
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:52,937
Hey.

807
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:55,287
Control, 7-Adam-15.

808
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,973
He's running. Get him.

809
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:30,409
7-Adam-15.

810
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:32,324
Foot pursuit
in an old subway tunnel.

811
00:31:32,368 --> 00:31:33,456
Heading South.

812
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:44,946
Control, Adam-100.

813
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:46,512
Go ahead and cancel
that backup call.

814
00:31:46,556 --> 00:31:48,210
We're Code 4.

815
00:31:48,253 --> 00:31:49,646
How did you guys
get here so fast?

816
00:31:49,689 --> 00:31:51,691
We were already here.

817
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:53,867
Did you...? Find the gold?

818
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:55,347
Let's see.

819
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:11,885
My gold. I was so close.

820
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:13,496
Yeah, not really.

821
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:16,586
What... How did you guys
even end up down here?

822
00:32:16,629 --> 00:32:18,022
Jerry found it with the file.

823
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:19,391
It said in there that
Stuart's sister worked at

824
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:21,025
the Bonaventure Hotel
up the street.

825
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:22,766
And their parking garage
has access to

826
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:25,334
all these abandoned
subway tunnels.

827
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,920
Yeah, so Jerry thought Stuart
might have known about it

828
00:32:26,944 --> 00:32:29,207
from his sister
and stashed the gold down here.

829
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,166
The entrance was sealed
a few years back,

830
00:32:31,209 --> 00:32:32,819
but I sweet-talked
the maintenance guys

831
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:34,560
so they opened up, let us in.

832
00:32:34,604 --> 00:32:35,953
Me and Jerry win.

833
00:32:35,997 --> 00:32:37,824
No, we would have
been here first,

834
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:40,610
but we had some police matters
to deal with.

835
00:32:40,653 --> 00:32:42,220
Great. Good job. We still won.

836
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:44,657
Nope, we're gonna call it a tie.

837
00:32:44,701 --> 00:32:46,746
What? No way it was a tie!

838
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,314
- 100% a tie.
- Ohh!

839
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:51,969
I wish Ronnie was here
to see this.

840
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:56,930
I bet he'd have been proud
you were the one who closed it.

841
00:32:56,974 --> 00:33:00,064
Yeah, not too bad
for an old-timer, huh?

842
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:01,326
You did great.

843
00:33:03,633 --> 00:33:05,461
Look, Jerry...

844
00:33:05,504 --> 00:33:06,505
Just...

845
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:08,942
It's my time.

846
00:33:10,074 --> 00:33:12,685
It's my last day on the job.

847
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:17,734
Thank you, Sergeant Bradford.

848
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:22,086
For what? I feel awful.

849
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,219
No, no, no, no.
You could've pushed me out

850
00:33:24,262 --> 00:33:26,699
on an involuntary disability,
but no.

851
00:33:28,266 --> 00:33:31,139
You let me go out
the way I came in...

852
00:33:31,182 --> 00:33:35,099
Working the streets...
on my last patrol.

853
00:33:40,104 --> 00:33:42,019
Thanks. Yeah.

854
00:34:28,152 --> 00:34:29,153
Damn it.

855
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,672
John, I was
searching Fred's house...

856
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,370
You what?! Yell at me later.

857
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:57,241
He's here now, and I'm trapped.

858
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:58,329
Sit tight. I'm nearby.

859
00:36:53,079 --> 00:36:55,212
John. What are you doing here?

860
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:56,561
Uh, well, I was on patrol,

861
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:58,389
and I realized I was
in your neighborhood.

862
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,739
And you stopped by to say hi?

863
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,525
Yeah, and... say thank you
for the party last night.

864
00:37:03,568 --> 00:37:05,309
I had a great time.

865
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:07,964
Sure. You're welcome.

866
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:10,619
Uh, Fred, I, um...

867
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:13,970
I also wanted to ask you
about Bailey.

868
00:37:15,406 --> 00:37:16,494
What about her?

869
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:17,887
Well, I'm an old-school guy,

870
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:21,325
and, uh, both of
Bailey's parents being gone,

871
00:37:21,369 --> 00:37:23,849
you are about the closest thing
she has to a father...

872
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:26,156
Stop.
If you are about to ask for

873
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:29,159
my blessing to marry Bailey,
don't say another word.

874
00:37:29,202 --> 00:37:30,247
You may be old-school,

875
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,901
but Bailey is as modern
as they come,

876
00:37:31,944 --> 00:37:33,816
and she would not appreciate
you talking to me

877
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:35,339
before talking to her.

878
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:36,732
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

879
00:37:36,775 --> 00:37:38,124
I don't know what
I was thinking.

880
00:37:39,561 --> 00:37:42,346
You really helped me
dodge a bullet there.

881
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,870
I've taken enough of your time.
Thank you very much.

882
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,394
Sure.

883
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:47,656
John...

884
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:50,180
Good luck.

885
00:37:50,223 --> 00:37:51,442
Thanks.

886
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:01,974
That was so stupid! Tell me about it.

887
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:04,237
I mean, you want to marry me
after only dating a month?

888
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:05,780
I had to say something
to distract him,

889
00:38:05,804 --> 00:38:07,023
and now I amgonna yell at you.

890
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:08,522
Do you... Fred has the victim's watch

891
00:38:08,546 --> 00:38:10,287
in his office,

892
00:38:10,331 --> 00:38:13,072
and a whole lot of other things
that look like trophies.

893
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:15,379
You can use that to get
a warrant, right?

894
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:18,121
Yes, I can.

895
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:20,341
I thought I was gonna
prove him innocent.

896
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:30,786
So, how was the date
with the badge bunny?

897
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:33,702
Well, with all due respect, sir,

898
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:35,399
her name is Cleo, okay? Mm.

899
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:36,444
Let's not label her.

900
00:38:36,487 --> 00:38:37,749
Last night, actually,

901
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:39,838
she was open and honest
about only dating cops,

902
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:42,493
so we shouldn't judge her
just 'cause she has a type.

903
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,713
You know, you're right.
I apologize.

904
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:45,994
Yeah.
How was your date with Cleo?

905
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:48,281
It was fantastic.
She's... She's great.

906
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:49,805
She thinks I'm great,

907
00:38:49,848 --> 00:38:52,111
and, uh, we're actually
going out again tonight.

908
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:54,853
I'm glad you found someone
who's not put off by your past.

909
00:38:56,812 --> 00:39:01,164
Actually, I don't think
she knows who I am.

910
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:03,514
You didn't tell her?
And you think that's fair?

911
00:39:03,558 --> 00:39:04,998
I mean, she told you about
her thing,

912
00:39:05,037 --> 00:39:06,928
but you want to keep her
in the dark about your thing?

913
00:39:06,952 --> 00:39:09,302
It's just...

914
00:39:09,346 --> 00:39:12,131
It's been a long time
since someone's liked me for me.

915
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:14,264
I understand, son.

916
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:18,224
But she's gonna find out
about it sooner or later,

917
00:39:18,268 --> 00:39:19,878
so who do you want her
to hear it from?

918
00:39:21,314 --> 00:39:23,186
Yeah.

919
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:26,276
I'll, uh...
I'll tell her tonight.

920
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:27,843
Good man.

921
00:39:29,322 --> 00:39:30,909
Can you imagine what that stuff
is worth now?

922
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:33,326
Phew. Yeah.

923
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:38,941
Hey.

924
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:39,942
What are you doing here?

925
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:41,378
Tim called.

926
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:44,860
I'm so proud of you.

927
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:49,081
Alright, folks,
attention, please.

928
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:52,520
Turn your hand packs
to the district channel.

929
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:54,696
I need to borrow your dad
for a second.

930
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:56,741
Hey, Jerry.Yeah.

931
00:40:00,353 --> 00:40:02,617
Control, 7-Adam-100.

932
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,836
I am privileged to announce
the retirement

933
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,624
of Officer Jerry McGrady,
badge number 9944.

934
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:12,801
After 43 years and 9 months
of service,

935
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:15,368
this concludes his final shift.

936
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:19,372
Officer McGrady, you, sir,
are End of Watch.

937
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,070
Congratulations.

938
00:40:31,776 --> 00:40:33,778
Uh...

939
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:37,565
It's been an honor
serving this great city

940
00:40:37,608 --> 00:40:39,523
all these years.

941
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:40,916
S-So...

942
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:47,836
take care of her
now that I'm gone.

943
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:57,193
- Whoo!
- Jerry!

944
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,155
Congrats.

945
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:15,167
That was really beautiful.

946
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:18,431
Dad won't forget it.

947
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:19,607
Neither will I.

948
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,348
It was my honor.

949
00:41:22,392 --> 00:41:25,047
Your dad is a hell of a guy.

950
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:28,703
You know, maybe I could
stop by the house sometime,

951
00:41:28,746 --> 00:41:30,400
see how he's handling
retirement.

952
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:32,794
That'd be great.And...

953
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:36,624
maybe... you and I
could grab dinner sometime?

954
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:38,669
Even better.

955
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:54,555
Judge signed off on the warrant.

956
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:56,445
I really don't think
you should be here for this.

957
00:41:56,469 --> 00:41:57,993
Tough. Hey.

958
00:41:58,036 --> 00:41:59,448
Remember, you said you don't
run towards bullets,

959
00:41:59,472 --> 00:42:01,039
so I shouldn't run
towards fire? Mm-hmm.

960
00:42:01,083 --> 00:42:03,564
Well, there could be bullets,
so I need you to stay...
