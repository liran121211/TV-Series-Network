I went to prison.

179
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,402
Do they believe
in your innocence?

180
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:39,229
Yeah, 100%.

181
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,361
They've both said that.

182
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:41,623
You know, there can be
a big difference

183
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,278
between what people say
and what they believe.

184
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,716
♪♪

185
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,978
Sorry. Let's --
Hold on.

186
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:51,285
Let me reset that.

187
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:57,683
Sorry.

188
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:03,297
Ro, Ro,
good to see you, man!

189
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,298
Yeah, you too, man.

190
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,560
Yeah.
You look so different.

191
00:07:05,604 --> 00:07:07,083
Yeah, I'm a little older.

192
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,172
No, it's not that.
I don't know.

193
00:07:09,216 --> 00:07:10,565
You're like
a different guy.

194
00:07:10,609 --> 00:07:12,480
Something like that.

195
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:13,916
I think I'm gonna cry.
Hey.

196
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,440
No, no, no crying.
You're gonna mess up my makeup.

197
00:07:15,483 --> 00:07:16,658
Oh!

198
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:18,486
Oh, I'm sorry
I didn't come sooner.

199
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,835
No, d-- don't worry about it,
really.

200
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,447
I'm just glad
to see you guys.

201
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,187
Alright, so let's,
uh, get inside.

202
00:07:24,231 --> 00:07:26,451
I got food, drinks...

203
00:07:26,494 --> 00:07:29,018
cameras, and, uh...

204
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:30,846
I'm sorry.
This is so weird.

205
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,326
Hey, it's fine. We're just happy
to see you, bro.

206
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:34,589
Yeah, me too.
Yeah.

207
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:36,243
Yeah. Alright.

208
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:37,374
Guys, I got to swap out
my battery.

209
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:38,854
Give me a second?

210
00:07:38,898 --> 00:07:40,508
Okay.

211
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,561
What the hell?

212
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,876
Holy --

213
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,530
Morris Mackey's throat
had been cut.

214
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:03,923
By the time
his body was found,

215
00:08:03,966 --> 00:08:05,968
he'd been dead approximately
four hours.

216
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:07,796
And who were
your initial suspects?

217
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,319
Everyone who stepped foot
in the house that day.

218
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,320
Including Aaron.

219
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,931
Everyone.

220
00:08:11,974 --> 00:08:14,629
Good morning.
Good morning.

221
00:08:14,673 --> 00:08:15,412
It's nice to see you again.

222
00:08:15,456 --> 00:08:17,153
Nice to see you!

223
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:18,154
I heard you were happy
with how

224
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:19,373
the last documentary
came out.

225
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,028
Oh, my God.
It was so good, and -- and --

226
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:24,596
And I got so many compliments.

227
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,729
Oh, that's great.
How about you?

228
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,557
Didn't see it.
Can we get started?

229
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:31,211
Uh, yeah.

230
00:08:31,254 --> 00:08:33,474
So, tell me what happened when
you arrived at the scene.

231
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:34,562
We were
the first responders.

232
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:42,962
Whoa.

233
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:43,963
Okay.

234
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,182
It was a...frenetic day.

235
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:50,578
So many people -- so --
so many personalities.

236
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:53,015
But when you're talking
a star-studded crime scene

237
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:56,410
with a witness list comprised
mostly of influencers,

238
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,107
I guess that's
no surprise.

239
00:08:58,151 --> 00:08:59,631
Alright, look,
even with all those cameras

240
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:02,111
and phones rolling in the house,
none of them caught anything

241
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,809
even remotely helpful
to our investigation.

242
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:05,332
Yeah. Luck?

243
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,987
It just wasn't in our cards
that day.

244
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:10,555
What?
Why are you so happy?

245
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:13,035
I am being colorful.

246
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:14,123
They will use more
of our coverage

247
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,560
if we give them evocative
sound bites.

248
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:16,952
I'm right, right?

249
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:18,867
Can we get back
to the murder?

250
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:21,174
I followed protocols.
You know, I -- I called it in,

251
00:09:21,217 --> 00:09:22,915
cleared the house,
did everything right.

252
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,264
Mm-hmm.
You believe me, right?

253
00:09:24,307 --> 00:09:25,744
O-Of course.

254
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:27,484
I mean, but we have to
follow protocol, too.

255
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,225
It's gonna be okay.

256
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,879
I can't believe this
is happening to me again.

257
00:09:30,923 --> 00:09:32,054
I know.

258
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,145
A-Are you okay?

259
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:37,930
I think I'm having, like,
a panic attack.

260
00:09:37,973 --> 00:09:39,584
Oh, okay.
Uh, just sit down,

261
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:40,715
and I'm gonna grab you
some water, okay?

262
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,977
I'll be right back.

263
00:09:42,021 --> 00:09:43,675
Show's over.
Time to go.

264
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:46,416
What? Uh, no, no, no.
No, it's not.

265
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,462
This is my house,
my production.

266
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,463
The show goes on.

267
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,638
Connor, keep filming.

268
00:09:50,682 --> 00:09:51,683
Yeah, that's not
how this works.

269
00:09:51,726 --> 00:09:52,814
This is
my crime scene.

270
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:55,425
Shut it off now.

271
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,601
Shut it off!

272
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:00,039
There was nothing
we could do.

273
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:01,214
Well, thanks for coming out.

274
00:10:01,257 --> 00:10:02,519
Yeah.

275
00:10:02,563 --> 00:10:04,870
Our paramedic crew was
short-staffed,

276
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:08,264
and since we're all EMT-trained,
I was subbing in.

277
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,309
Oh, I don't understand.

278
00:10:09,352 --> 00:10:10,527
Why were you called in
at all?

279
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:12,181
He was clearly dead,
right?

280
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:14,575
You have no idea how many people
I see look that way

281
00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:16,185
and then spring back to life.

282
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,796
Oh. Interesting.

283
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,101
And what did you think
at the time?

284
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:20,668
Did it seem to you
like Aaron did it?

285
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:23,410
Of course not. He would never do
anything like that.

286
00:10:23,453 --> 00:10:25,586
Really? And you're confident
saying that --

287
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,197
considering
your ex-husband?

288
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:31,679
Wow. Okay.

289
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,289
Ah, clearly,
you come prepared.

290
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:38,207
Yeah, um, I --
I married a sociopath once.

291
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:41,297
So maybe I'm not
the best judge of character.

292
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,647
It's not about being
a good judge of character.

293
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,126
We judge by the facts.

294
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,693
And what did the facts say?

295
00:10:45,737 --> 00:10:47,652
At first?

296
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:48,914
Not much.

297
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:52,744
How long you been here
filming today?

298
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:54,441
About three
or four hours.

299
00:10:54,484 --> 00:10:55,616
After rehearsal
this morning,

300
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,009
they had Everest and me
in the kitchen,

301
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:58,532
getting our hair
and makeup done

302
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,012
while they filmed
other stuff.

303
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:01,491
So you were in the kitchen
the whole time?

304
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:05,234
Uh, well, I did sneak off
to crafty once or...

305
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:06,714
four times.
I heard they had ice cream,

306
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:07,976
and I've been dieting
like crazy

307
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,238
'cause I was gonna be
on television,

308
00:11:09,282 --> 00:11:10,762
and I heard the camera
adds like 10 pounds.

309
00:11:10,805 --> 00:11:12,328
Is that true?

310
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,982
So when was the last time
you saw Morris?

311
00:11:14,026 --> 00:11:15,810
Honestly, I ain't seen him
all day.

312
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:17,116
I was dealing with work stuff

313
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,900
right up
until we started filming.

314
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,946
And where were you
when Morris's body was found?

315
00:11:20,989 --> 00:11:22,904
In my office.

316
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,079
And how would
you characterize

317
00:11:24,123 --> 00:11:26,342
Aaron's relationship
with Morris?

318
00:11:29,345 --> 00:11:30,956
It's important
you tell the truth.

319
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:35,525
They didn't always agree about
the direction of the show.

320
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,310
But my son,
he would never hurt anyone.

321
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:47,450
Hey, do we really have
to do this in here?

322
00:11:47,494 --> 00:11:48,713
Yes, we do, son.

323
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:53,718
Per government code 3300
and per Lybarger,

324
00:11:53,761 --> 00:11:56,198
I am required to advise
that you do nothave

325
00:11:56,242 --> 00:11:57,852
the right
to remain silent.

326
00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:00,550
Anything you say can
and will be used against you.

327
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,379
Refusal to fully
and completely answer

328
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:06,078
all of Detective Lopez's
questions

329
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:09,516
will result
in immediate termination.

330
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,693
Do you understand?

331
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:13,781
Yes, sir.

332
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:15,087
And I'm here
to protect you

333
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,828
as your union representative.

334
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,612
This is your choice.

335
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,570
But like
Sergeant Grey said,

336
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,790
if you choose not to cooperate,
you will lose your job.

337
00:12:22,834 --> 00:12:23,965
Of course I'll cooperate.

338
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:27,229
Good man.

339
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:30,711
Alright.

340
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:31,799
I'll leave you to it.

341
00:12:35,716 --> 00:12:36,848
I didn't kill Morris.

342
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:44,986
When I saw him lying there,
like Patrick...

343
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,379
I understand.

344
00:12:46,422 --> 00:12:48,120
But it was common knowledge
that you and Morris

345
00:12:48,163 --> 00:12:49,730
weren't on
the best of terms.

346
00:12:49,774 --> 00:12:53,125
Who are you with? TMZ?

347
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:54,735
You still feeding off my grief, you vultures?!
Come on, guys.

348
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:55,736
Morris,
what are you doing, man?
Get 'em out of here, man!

349
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,738
Get out of here now!
Go!

350
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,827
Yeah, what he did
to Patrick's dad

351
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:03,570
was callous and exploitative,

352
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:05,398
but I wouldn't kill him
for it.

353
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,834
Yeah, that was bad.

354
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:10,359
Aaron pulled over Patrick's dad
in a routine car stop.

355
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:12,884
It was a total random reunion,

356
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:16,322
but Morris and his cameraman
were there filming,

357
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:18,672
and that just made
everything worse.

358
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,067
Dexter Hayes, he was a --
a grieving father, you know?

359
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,027
And he -- he took a swing
at Officer Thorsen,

360
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,159
so we had to book him,

361
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:30,205
but we let him go
as soon as we could.

362
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:32,599
And, you know, I thought
that would be the end of it.

363
00:13:32,642 --> 00:13:33,861
But you suspected
that Patrick's dad

364
00:13:33,905 --> 00:13:36,081
could have killed Morris?
We did.

365
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:39,084
He was furious
about "Every Rose Has A --"

366
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:41,347
about the reality show.

367
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,916
And after years of the press
feeding off of his grief,

368
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,832
yeah, it was believable
that he could've snapped.

369
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,964
This is absurd.
You do know that?

370
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:50,878
Alright, sir,
can you tell me where you were

371
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:52,314
yesterday afternoon?

372
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:54,882
I was in the office,
morning to midnight.

373
00:13:54,926 --> 00:13:56,884
Ask any one
of my employees.

374
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:58,625
I didn't do this.

375
00:13:58,668 --> 00:14:00,627
Any idea who did?

376
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,717
I can tell you that
whoever killed that man,

377
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,851
his last name is Thorsen.

378
00:14:06,894 --> 00:14:09,679
I blame myself for ever letting
them into Patrick's life.

379
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,029
They're a sick family.

380
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:13,466
And Aaron is not
the only killer among them.

381
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:14,771
What did he mean by that?

382
00:14:14,815 --> 00:14:15,990
You know
what he meant by that.

383
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:18,384
And we knew
from the reality show

384
00:14:18,427 --> 00:14:20,908
that Morris gave
Aaron's father a clear motive.

385
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:23,563
And that's what I was thinking
for the opening theme.

386
00:14:23,606 --> 00:14:24,520
Yeah?
Yeah.

387
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,260
I like it.

388
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:26,827
You do?

389
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:28,437
Almost as much
as I like you.

390
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:29,961
Mm.

391
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:31,919
You're so sweet.

392
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:33,399
Oh.

393
00:14:33,442 --> 00:14:34,530
Hey!

394
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,663
You hooking up
with my wife, man?!

395
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:37,925
Linc,
it's not what you think.

396
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:40,449
Boy, you better get
the hell up out of here!

397
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:44,845
What the hell was that?!

398
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:46,978
Are you seriously doing this
to me again?!

399
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,457
In my own house!

400
00:14:48,501 --> 00:14:49,894
There's footage
of Lincoln catching

401
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:51,765
Morris and Yvonne
in an intimate moment.

402
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,941
That had to factor
into your investigation.

403
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:56,248
Jealousy is
a primal motive.

404
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,640
And some believe
that Lincoln had killed

405
00:14:57,684 --> 00:14:59,164
for jealousy
once before.

406
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:01,470
He was a suspect in
a 20-year-old murder, wasn't he?

407
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:02,471
Yes, he was.

408
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:11,003
What can you
tell me about your father's
hip-hop duo, Flex n' Flow?

409
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:11,960
I mean, I was, like, a baby,
you know,

410
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:13,527
when they were
at their height.

411
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,399
And, uh, that was the year
"Make Da Noise" went platinum.

412
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:17,400
Flex n' Flow
had one of the most

413
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:18,967
iconic singles
of the late '90s.

414
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:20,360
Oh, my God.
"Make Da Noise"?

415
00:15:20,403 --> 00:15:23,450
That's like one
of my go-to karaoke jams.

Oh, yes, that's me.

00:15:56,657 --> 00:15:59,094
I was a Flow Girl.

434
00:15:59,138 --> 00:16:00,922
Wait. What?

435
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:03,794
There was a scout who saw me
cheering in high school,

436
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,492
and he asked me to audition.

437
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:07,842
At first, I thought he was
just trying to get in my pants.

438
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:13,108
But it turned out to be legit,
and it was for Flex n' Flow.

439
00:16:13,152 --> 00:16:15,154
I was the biggest fan.

440
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:16,459
What are you
wearing, by the way?

441
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:19,810
Oh, I teach capoeira
on Thursdays and Sundays.

442
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:20,986
Oh.

443
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:22,726
Did you ever see
Flex n' Flow argue

444
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,640
while you were working
with them?

445
00:16:23,684 --> 00:16:26,339
Mm, I mean...well, sure,

446
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:28,167
but nothing serious.

447
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,082
They were like brothers,
and brothers fight.

448
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:31,518
What do you say to the people
who are convinced

449
00:16:31,561 --> 00:16:33,389
that your husband
killed his late partner?

450
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:36,392
Oh, honey, this alleged "feud"
between Linc and Calvin

451
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:39,265
has gotten blown way out
of proportion over the years.

452
00:16:39,308 --> 00:16:41,223
But what about the night
of Calvin's murder?

453
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,399
The infamous pre-release party
for "2 Hype Homies"?

454
00:16:43,443 --> 00:16:46,054
Did the party
get a little wild? Sure.

455
00:16:46,098 --> 00:16:48,274
Did the police come
and break it up? Mm-hmm.

456
00:16:48,317 --> 00:16:51,059
And did Linc and Calvin argue?
You bet.

457
00:16:51,103 --> 00:16:53,105
But they were just
passionate people.

458
00:16:53,148 --> 00:16:56,238
And nobody
ever threatened nobody.

459
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:59,589
Yeah, they, uh --
they threatened each other.

460
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:00,764
I was there.

461
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:02,418
I was a rookie officer then.

462
00:17:02,462 --> 00:17:05,204
And my T.O. and I had got
a 415 call

463
00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:07,684
for an out-of-control party.

464
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:11,558
It was a record release event
for Flex n' Flow.

465
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:14,082
But anyway,
as we were breaking things up,

466
00:17:14,126 --> 00:17:16,432
I saw Flex n' Flow
in each other's faces.

467
00:17:16,476 --> 00:17:18,086
Could you hear
what they were fighting about?

468
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:21,307
No. Um, as I approached,
their limousine was pulling up.

469
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,178
But Flex -- um --

470
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:25,833
um, I'm sorry, Lincoln --
was still very hot.

471
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:30,533
He refused to get into the limo
with Flow, and, um...

472
00:17:30,577 --> 00:17:33,014
Yeah, he said
that he'd rather walk

473
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:35,277
than to deal
with Flow's nonsense.

474
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,539
Um...

475
00:17:36,583 --> 00:17:38,541
It was a good thing, too.

476
00:17:38,585 --> 00:17:40,804
A devastating loss
for the music industry today,

477
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:44,808
as Calvin Yard, one half
of the popular duo Flex n' Flow,

478
00:17:44,852 --> 00:17:47,159
was gunned down in Los Angeles
last night

479
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:49,683
after leaving
his record launch party.

480
00:17:49,726 --> 00:17:51,598
It couldn't have been
more than five minutes later

481
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:54,122
that we got
a shots-fired call.

482
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:58,561
As Flow's limo was making
the turn on La Cienega,

483
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:01,956
a car pulled alongside it
and unloaded 20 rounds

484
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:03,436
at the rear of the vehicle.

485
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:07,440
Um, Flow was shot
seven times.

486
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:11,183
Yeah.

487
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:13,402
That was my first homicide.

488
00:18:13,446 --> 00:18:14,925
I'll never forget it.

489
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,840
It changes you.

490
00:18:16,884 --> 00:18:21,149
I did not have anything to do
with Calvin's death.

491
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:22,629
But at the time of
his murder, all the talk was --

492
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:23,934
That was garbage, man.

493
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,153
All garbage.

494
00:18:25,197 --> 00:18:26,328
I loved Calvin
like a brother.

495
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,330
You know, this --

496
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,897
this is
straight-up exploitive.

497
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,856
Calvin's murder was solved
decades ago, and you know it.

498
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,295
A man named Gary Brown
was convicted of Flow's murder.

499
00:18:36,338 --> 00:18:38,775
It turns out Flow
was sleeping with Gary's wife.

500
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:42,257
So as far as the LAPD
was concerned, case closed.

501
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:44,651
Yeah, but the aura of guilt
haunted Lincoln's reputation

502
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:46,783
like a dark shroud.

503
00:18:46,827 --> 00:18:47,915
I'm sorry.

504
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,265
That was really good.

505
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:52,180
Thanks.

506
00:18:52,224 --> 00:18:54,095
And with Lincoln alibi'd out,
you know,

507
00:18:54,139 --> 00:18:56,358
the investigation
focused on Yvonne.

508
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:58,447
Mrs. Thorsen, how long
had you been having an affair

509
00:18:58,491 --> 00:18:59,361
with Morris Mackey?

510
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:00,797
Please.

511
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:02,451
I was not sleeping
with him.

512
00:19:02,495 --> 00:19:05,019
But the footage -- from
"Every Rose Has A Thorsen" --

513
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:07,587
we saw it.That was for the show.

514
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,371
What, are you saying
you staged it?

515
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:12,635
It's a reality show.
Of course we staged it.

516
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:14,681
I can prove it.
I have the rest of the footage.

517
00:19:14,724 --> 00:19:16,900
Boy, you better get
the hell up out of here!

518
00:19:19,686 --> 00:19:21,122
What the hell was that?!

519
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,472
Are you seriously doing this
to me again?!

520
00:19:23,516 --> 00:19:24,473
In my own house!

521
00:19:24,517 --> 00:19:26,823
You got some nerve!

522
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,651
L-Let's talk about all the women
you slept with

523
00:19:28,695 --> 00:19:30,436
when you were F-Flex?

524
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:32,438
Cut!

525
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:34,440
Cut, cut, cut, cut.

526
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:37,791
Linc, buddy,
you're going off-script.

527
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:38,966
"I can't believe
you're seriously

528
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:40,272
doing this to me again"?

529
00:19:40,315 --> 00:19:41,882
That's not the line.

530
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:43,318
Yeah, man,
I was improv'ing a little.

531
00:19:43,362 --> 00:19:45,190
Yeah, maybe not do that,
okay?

532
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:46,843
It's a lot more powerful
if this is the first time

533
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:48,236
Yvonne has stepped out
on you.

534
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,238
Okay.
So, Morris, how did I do?

535
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:51,892
It was a bit big.

536
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,807
Yeah, maybe, uh,
dial it back a hair.

537
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,025
Let's go again.

538
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,636
Back to one.

539
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:57,898
Go.

540
00:19:57,941 --> 00:19:58,986
We're making a show,
people.

541
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:03,556
None of that was in the footage
you turned over to us.

542
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:05,210
Oops. My bad.

543
00:20:05,253 --> 00:20:07,516
We want everything --
now --

544
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,518
or you'll be arrested
for obstruction.

545
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:11,999
Ooh, that was good.

546
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:14,001
Do you think I can get
a copy of that?

547
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:16,003
That will play really well
in the show.

548
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:17,700
Mrs. Thorsen,
this is serious.

549
00:20:17,744 --> 00:20:19,528
Morris Mackey was murdered
in your house.

550
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:21,095
Your son
is still a suspect.

551
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,140
Just like the police
to only focus

552
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:25,273
on what's
in front of their nose.

553
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,928
Morris Mackey didn't just appear
out of thin air

554
00:20:27,971 --> 00:20:29,408
when he started working
for me.

555
00:20:29,451 --> 00:20:31,975
Honey,
the man had enemies.

556
00:20:37,198 --> 00:20:38,634
They're the crazy ones!

557
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:40,157
We're the sane ones!

558
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,290
You're the cult!
You're sheep!

559
00:20:42,334 --> 00:20:44,423
Prior to working
with the Thorsen family,

560
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:47,948
Morris had been hired by a bunch
of QAnon conspiracy theorists.

561
00:20:47,991 --> 00:20:49,950
Apparently, they didn't like
the negative publicity

562
00:20:49,993 --> 00:20:51,212
they were getting,

563
00:20:51,256 --> 00:20:53,258
and they wanted
to show their side.

564
00:20:53,301 --> 00:20:54,476
Try to control
the narrative.

565
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,738
Mm.
So what happened?

566
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:57,697
Morris was allowed
into the inner sanctum.

567
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,439
Conducted dozens of interviews
with founders and followers.

568
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:02,484
But he didn't make
a propaganda film,

569
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:03,790
he told the truth.

570
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:05,052
We're in a war.

571
00:21:05,095 --> 00:21:06,793
Every one of us is prepared
to start killing

572
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:07,968
for our freedom.

573
00:21:08,011 --> 00:21:09,143
Morris may have won
an Emmy,

574
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:10,797
but he also pissed off
a lot of unhinged

575
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,538
and hyper-violent people.

576
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:14,148
The storm is coming.

577
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:14,801
There will be retribution.

578
00:21:17,566 --> 00:21:21,004
I've heard rumors
that you have insight into
the QAnon angle on this case.

579
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:23,137
Have you ever tried to put
toothpaste back in the tube?

580
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,226
Look, I know
it's an expression,

581
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:27,706
but have you actually tried
to do it?

582
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,273
I have.

583
00:21:29,317 --> 00:21:31,101
It's basically impossible.

584
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:32,842
And what do you think Q
is trying to tell people

585
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:35,584
with his Q-Drops,
these cryptic messages?

586
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,151
I really wasn't trying
to say anything.

587
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:40,110
I was just typing, and maybe
I got a little carried away.

588
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:41,677
Wait.
What did you say?

589
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:46,508
Well, I guess now is as good
a time as any to reveal it.

590
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:50,599
I'm Q.

591
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,948
Smitty is Q?

592
00:21:51,992 --> 00:21:52,949
I'm sorry. What?

593
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:54,559
Lord, give me strength.
What?

594
00:21:54,603 --> 00:21:57,127
A lot of writers
use pseudonyms.

595
00:21:57,171 --> 00:21:59,826
Q is my first initial,
so...

596
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:01,262
Hey, is my name down there?

597
00:22:03,438 --> 00:22:04,482
But it was an accident?

598
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:06,876
He -- He didn't start it
on purpose?

599
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,008
That's what he said.

600
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:09,487
Yeah,
sounds like Smitty.

601
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:11,620
I was trying to start
the fan-fiction club

602
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,231
for "This Is Us,"
and things just got out of hand.

603
00:22:14,275 --> 00:22:15,842
What the hell
does "This is Us" fanfic

604
00:22:15,885 --> 00:22:17,191
have to do with a cult?

605
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:20,324
I mistakenly mixed cough syrup
with diet pills

606
00:22:20,368 --> 00:22:22,979
when I was writing
this satanic, alien story line

607
00:22:23,023 --> 00:22:25,112
for Jack and Rebecca.

608
00:22:25,155 --> 00:22:27,897
I woke up the next morning
and read it --

609
00:22:27,941 --> 00:22:29,246
none of it made sense.

610
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,553
But, overnight,
I'd gotten so many followers,

611
00:22:31,596 --> 00:22:32,859
I just went with it.

612
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:35,339
You can't put the toothpaste
back in the tube.

613
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,649
Morris had received threats from
hundreds of QAnon followers,

614
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,130
but when we started
investigating them,

615
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:45,175
one immediately stood out.

616
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:46,481
Tell me
about Connor Hart.

617
00:22:46,524 --> 00:22:47,961
What about him
got your attention?

618
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:50,659
Well, he was working as a
cameraman on the reality show,

619
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,922
so -- that.

620
00:22:54,097 --> 00:22:56,621
Connor,
thanks for coming down.

621
00:22:56,665 --> 00:22:58,014
I'm not in trouble, am I?

622
00:22:58,058 --> 00:23:01,104
No. We just need to clear
a few things up.

623
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:03,498
I told you
everything I know.

624
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:06,631
I was getting a battery,
and he was just lying there.

625
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:08,155
I'm not sure
if you're aware,

626
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:10,679
but it's common to run
background checks on witnesses.

627
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,420
And when we looked into you,
we discovered

628
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:13,682
that you're a member
of QAnon.

629
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,336
No, no, no, I --

630
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:17,338
I may have gone
to a political rally or two,

631
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:18,730
but I'm really
not into that.

632
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:20,471
I swear.

633
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:22,125
We're in a war.

634
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:24,998
Every one of us is prepared to
start killing for our freedom.

635
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,564
The storm is coming.

636
00:23:26,608 --> 00:23:28,001
There will be retribution.

637
00:23:33,571 --> 00:23:36,139
So, clearly,
you are a follower of Q.

638
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:37,358
Why would you work
for Morris?

639
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:38,968
Honestly?

640
00:23:39,012 --> 00:23:40,404
I realized
Morris was the best thing

641
00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:42,145
that could have happened
to the movement.

642
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:43,364
That makes no sense.

643
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:45,192
But it does.

644
00:23:45,235 --> 00:23:47,977
Morris's documentary exposed
who was a true believer.

645
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:50,284
And who wasn't.

646
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:52,547
He never admitted it,

647
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,637
but I think Morris
was working for Q.

648
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,508
That's why I followed him
to the next gig.

649
00:23:57,552 --> 00:23:59,684
Do you still consider yourself
a believer of Q?

650
00:23:59,728 --> 00:24:02,818
Well, some stuff
didn't come true.

651
00:24:02,861 --> 00:24:04,951
The London bombing,
the Pope's arrest,

652
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:06,343
Zuckerberg still has a job.

653
00:24:06,387 --> 00:24:08,084
January 20th
came and went,

654
00:24:08,128 --> 00:24:10,217
March 4th came and went.

655
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,002
I'm starting to think Kennedy
is still dead.

656
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:14,134
Both of them.

657
00:24:14,177 --> 00:24:15,439
Mm.

658
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:18,442
So you don't believe
in Q anymore?

659
00:24:18,486 --> 00:24:20,183
Oh, I believe every word.

660
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:21,706
Connor was, um --

661
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,578
Deranged?

662
00:24:23,621 --> 00:24:26,015
Let's say...
reality-challenged,

663
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:27,799
which doesn't make him
a killer.

664
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:30,585
No. And the fact that he had
a camera on his shoulder

665
00:24:30,628 --> 00:24:32,456
for the entire
murder window

666
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,458
means that he couldn't
have killed Morris,

667
00:24:34,502 --> 00:24:36,591
so we were back
to square one.

668
00:24:36,634 --> 00:24:38,419
When the QAnon lead
didn't pan out,

669
00:24:38,462 --> 00:24:40,247
how did you pick up
the pieces of the case?

670
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:42,989
We rolled up our sleeves
and put in the hours.

671
00:24:43,032 --> 00:24:44,512
We took on
the painstaking process

672
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:47,254
of reviewing
every piece of video Morris shot

673
00:24:47,297 --> 00:24:48,733
in the weeks
before he died,

674
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:52,737
including the footage
Yvonne "forgot" to give us.

675
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:54,565
Until I found something
that changed everything.

676
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:57,090
♪♪

677
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:59,309
Lopez!

678
00:24:59,353 --> 00:25:00,876
Come look at this!

679
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:02,573
So I immediately informed
Detective Lopez

680
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:03,531
of what I discovered.

681
00:25:03,574 --> 00:25:04,314
Look what I just found.

682
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:05,750
Wow.

683
00:25:05,794 --> 00:25:06,751
What?

684
00:25:06,795 --> 00:25:08,623
Look.

685
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:10,320
Okay.

686
00:25:16,022 --> 00:25:18,676
I thought I knew everything
about Patrick's murder.

687
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,983
I had done my homework.

688
00:25:21,027 --> 00:25:25,422
But the truth was hiding right
in front of me all this time.

689
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:28,469
I know
who killed Patrick Hayes.

690
00:25:28,512 --> 00:25:29,644
And I can prove it. I --

691
00:25:32,603 --> 00:25:33,604
Uh, someone's here.

692
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,216
More to follow.

693
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:37,608
That video
was recorded

694
00:25:37,652 --> 00:25:39,523
minutes before
Morris was murdered.

695
00:25:42,288 --> 00:25:44,726
I mean, Morris
claiming that he knew

696
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:45,988
who the killer was
must've been energizing for you.

697
00:25:46,031 --> 00:25:46,989
Finally. A break
in your roommate's murder --

698
00:25:47,032 --> 00:25:49,339
No, he --
He wasn't my roommate.

699
00:25:49,382 --> 00:25:51,820
And I -- I hate when people
call him that --

700
00:25:51,863 --> 00:25:53,343
you know, like we found
each other

701
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:55,737
on some French Craigslist
or something like that.

702
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,086
Patrick was my best friend,

703
00:25:57,129 --> 00:25:58,566
from the time
that we were little kids.

704
00:25:58,609 --> 00:25:59,828
I mean, I was at his house
so often,

705
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:01,656
his dad bought us
two of everything,

706
00:26:01,699 --> 00:26:02,961
you know, like siblings.

707
00:26:03,005 --> 00:26:04,746
Yeah,
Patrick was my brother.

708
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:06,182
How did it feel to hear
that Morris thought

709
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:08,053
he'd discovered
who killed Patrick?

710
00:26:08,097 --> 00:26:12,405
I mean, there had been
so many theories over the years.

711
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:15,147
And so many people think
that they had it figured out.

712
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:18,716
I -- I just never really
got my hopes up about it.

713
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,500
This was different, though.
I mean, he made a break

714
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,850
in the case
and died minutes later.

715
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:23,765
You have to see
the connection.

716
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:28,160
Well, uh, in the words
of Detective Harper --

717
00:26:28,204 --> 00:26:31,294
We look for facts,
not stories.

718
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:32,991
Yeah, sure, but, I mean,
the timing --

719
00:26:33,035 --> 00:26:35,167
I mean, these murders
had to be related.

720
00:26:35,211 --> 00:26:37,648
Whoever killed Patrick
also killed Morris.

721
00:26:37,692 --> 00:26:38,910
Is it possible
Morris found out

722
00:26:38,954 --> 00:26:40,651
that Aaron was the killer
all along?

723
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:42,174
Not a chance.
The Paris police

724
00:26:42,218 --> 00:26:45,700
never had a shred of evidence
against Aaron.

725
00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:47,397
They fumbled
the entire case.

726
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,703
Right off the bat,
the paparazzi

727
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:50,487
completely contaminated
the crime scene.

728
00:27:07,722 --> 00:27:09,811
But Aaron's DNA
was all over the murder weapon.

729
00:27:09,854 --> 00:27:11,421
You mean the knife
the killer pulled

730
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,858
from the kitchen block
on Aaron and Patrick's counter?

731
00:27:13,902 --> 00:27:16,426
What -- What do you want to bet
that if we went to your house,

732
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,602
we'd find your DNA
all over your stuff, too?

733
00:27:18,646 --> 00:27:20,909
I mean --

734
00:27:20,952 --> 00:27:22,345
Was that too mean?

735
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:24,956
No, that actually
felt good.

736
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,523
It was a dumb question.

737
00:27:26,566 --> 00:27:28,046
From the beginning,
the French police's case

738
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:29,700
against Aaron
seemed flawed --

739
00:27:29,744 --> 00:27:31,702
Oh, yeah.
Their case was a mess --

740
00:27:31,746 --> 00:27:34,270
and their forensics
were compromised.

741
00:27:34,313 --> 00:27:36,707
I mean, the theory
that Aaron killed Patrick

742
00:27:36,751 --> 00:27:38,970
because he didn't do his share
of the chores never made sense.

743
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:41,059
For one thing,
they had a housekeeper.

744
00:27:41,103 --> 00:27:42,626
For another,
Aaron is not a psychopath,

745
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,454
which you would have to be
to stab your roommate

746
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,586
for leaving dirty dishes
in the sink.

747
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:50,068
I mean, I've come close to
stabbing him over dirty dishes,

748
00:27:50,112 --> 00:27:52,636
but that's different --
we're married.

749
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,898
Mm.

750
00:27:53,942 --> 00:27:55,204
What do you say
to the theory

751
00:27:55,247 --> 00:27:57,249
that Aaron had a falling out
with his roommate?

752
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:59,991
Aaron and Patrick
were out partying that night.

753
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:01,689
Does that sound like
a broken friendship

754
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:03,299
careening towards murder?

755
00:28:03,342 --> 00:28:05,518
By his own admission, Aaron was
taking prescription drugs.

756
00:28:05,562 --> 00:28:08,391
Yeah. For a football injury
he got in high school.

757
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:11,611
They impair your ability
to operate heavy machinery,

758
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:14,397
not -- not turn you
into a hardened killer.

♪♪

760
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,009
Aaron passed out early.

761
00:28:18,053 --> 00:28:19,228
Woke up in the middle
of the night.

762
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:22,753
Went to pee
and found Patrick's body.

763

♪♪

764
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:34,765
The French police took one look
at a young Black man,

765
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:36,680
and decided he was the killer.

766
00:28:36,724 --> 00:28:39,161
I mean, they didn't even pursue
any other suspects.

767
00:28:39,204 --> 00:28:40,858
Bonjour, I appreciate you
speaking with me.

768
00:28:40,902 --> 00:28:43,252
Your accent
is terrible.

769
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:44,644
Um, Detective,
you've been accused

770
00:28:44,688 --> 00:28:46,995
of leading an incredibly biased
investigation --

771
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:48,779
Mais non.

772
00:28:48,823 --> 00:28:50,259
We followed the facts.

773
00:28:50,302 --> 00:28:52,217
Mm. And the fact
that Patrick picked up

774
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:53,697
a woman at the club
that night?

775
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:54,959
Collette Lavinge?

776
00:28:55,003 --> 00:28:57,614
She was seen leaving
the apartment

777
00:28:57,657 --> 00:28:59,094
before the time of death.

778
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,443
Understand?

779
00:29:00,486 --> 00:29:02,662
What about her jealous,
controlling boyfriend?

780
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:03,838
Did you interview him?

781
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,756
No. We did not.
Mm.

782
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,235
But the thing that
ultimately got you released

783
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:12,934
from prison was the
identification of this man.

784
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:14,326
Yeah.
Collette's boyfriend, Julien.

785
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,938
Handsome. French.

786
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:18,678
And, you know,
let's just say it --

787
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:20,289
he's super white.
You know?

788
00:29:20,332 --> 00:29:21,899
Uh, what is --

789
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:24,293
What is "Finance Bro"
in French?

790
00:29:24,336 --> 00:29:26,817
Shouldn't you know that?
You spent years in France.

791
00:29:26,861 --> 00:29:29,080
Yeah, but I didn't --
I didn't retain it.

792
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:32,214
It was actually a group
of Internet sleuths

793
00:29:32,257 --> 00:29:33,998
who found
Collette's boyfriend.

794
00:29:34,042 --> 00:29:37,349
They spent countless hours
investigating Aaron's case.

795
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:39,090
They also pointed
the finger at dozens

796
00:29:39,134 --> 00:29:40,788
of innocent people,
ruining their lives.

797
00:29:40,831 --> 00:29:43,834
Yes. Some members of the group
took it a little too far.

798
00:29:43,878 --> 00:29:46,445
We've been looking at the
Internet sleuths, actually.

799
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:50,188

I might have logged on once --
once or twice, yeah.

803
00:29:59,023 --> 00:30:00,720
Seriously?

804
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:02,635
I mean, can you not see
how people would take that

805
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:04,115
as a clear sign of bias?

806
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,032
I categorically deny any
preferential treatment, okay?

807
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:09,294
How can you say
that with a straight face,

808
00:30:09,338 --> 00:30:10,861
when it was revealed that Julien
was the son

809
00:30:10,905 --> 00:30:12,515
of the French
Finance Minister?

810
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:14,038
Are you telling me you didn't
get a phone call asking you --

811
00:30:14,865 --> 00:30:15,910
Merci beaucoup.

812
00:30:15,953 --> 00:30:17,215
C'est terminé.

813
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:18,651
Merci.

814
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:20,610
Oh, come on. Don't do that.
Come back.

815
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,220
So, it must've been
so frustrating to learn

816
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:24,092
that the French police
knew his identity

817
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:26,877
before your first trial
and didn't say anything.

818
00:30:26,921 --> 00:30:28,313
I mean, yeah.
The -- The good news

819
00:30:28,357 --> 00:30:31,621
was that the fact
that they ignored Julien --

820
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,884
uh, it got me my retrial.

821
00:30:33,928 --> 00:30:38,584
But the bad news was the
unidentified DNA on the knife --

822
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,021
it -- it didn't belong
to Julien.

823
00:30:40,064 --> 00:30:42,240
So he --
You know, he had an alibi.

824
00:30:42,284 --> 00:30:43,720
As horrible
as the experience was,

825
00:30:43,763 --> 00:30:45,678
is there anything that you
actually miss from that time?

826
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:47,202
I miss?

827
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,159
God, no.

828
00:30:48,203 --> 00:30:50,335

829
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:51,902
Well, Carlos.

831
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:53,861
Yeah.

832
00:30:53,904 --> 00:30:56,080
Uh, Carlos the Jackal.

833
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:57,908
He -- He was my cellmate.

834
00:30:57,952 --> 00:31:00,693
And, uh, man, pbht,
he has some stories.

835
00:31:00,737 --> 00:31:02,608
So you're saying the Jackal
got you through

836
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,262
your year and a half
of incarceration?

837
00:31:04,306 --> 00:31:05,481
No.

838
00:31:05,524 --> 00:31:06,482
My mom did.

839
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:08,353
Yeah, I don't --

840
00:31:08,397 --> 00:31:10,399
I don't think I would have got
through it without her.

841
00:31:10,442 --> 00:31:11,791
Um...

842
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:15,534
She actually leased an apartment
in Paris

843
00:31:15,578 --> 00:31:17,014
until I was released.

844
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:19,321
And, uh, she visited me
every week.

845
00:31:19,364 --> 00:31:21,192
And I'll tell you what.
If they would have let her,

846
00:31:21,236 --> 00:31:22,280
she would have been over there
every day.

847
00:31:22,324 --> 00:31:23,891
Of course I moved to Paris.

I'm his mother.

849
00:31:25,414 --> 00:31:27,938

time for him if I could.

00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:25,127
Mm. We have footage
of her shopping

879
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,172
on the Champs-Elysées
the night of the murder.

880
00:32:27,216 --> 00:32:29,522
Okay, well, that --
That's impossible.

881
00:32:29,566 --> 00:32:30,697
Isn't this her?

882
00:32:32,264 --> 00:32:37,704
♪♪

883
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:41,578
Okay.

884
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:45,190
Officer Thorsen,
come back.

885
00:32:45,234 --> 00:32:47,584
Come on.
Let's finish this interview.

886
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:49,673
Hey, there he is.

887
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:50,935
You lied to me.
Jimmy, get down.

888
00:32:50,979 --> 00:32:52,415
You lied to everyone.

889
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:54,112
I didn't want all
my private business out there

890
00:32:54,156 --> 00:32:55,374
for all the world
to see.

891
00:32:55,418 --> 00:32:57,072
Mom, you are literally
producing

892
00:32:57,115 --> 00:32:58,464
a reality show
about our lives.

893
00:32:58,508 --> 00:33:00,162
That's different.

894
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:02,381
I was on trial for murder,
fighting for my life.

895
00:33:02,425 --> 00:33:03,730
Exactly.

896
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:06,037
The fact that I was even
in Paris on that night --

897
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:07,299
how does that help you?

898
00:33:07,343 --> 00:33:08,431
And what was
your reaction

899
00:33:08,474 --> 00:33:09,693
to the revelation
that Aaron's mother

900
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:11,173
was in Paris at the time
of the murder?

901
00:33:11,216 --> 00:33:13,044
Like, bombshell.
Game changer.

902
00:33:13,088 --> 00:33:15,438
I mean, none of this stuff came
out at the time of the trial.

903
00:33:15,481 --> 00:33:16,787
This is --

904
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,789
It's so exciting,
what it means for the case --

905
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:21,052
Not for Aaron.
His mom lied to him.

906
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:23,620
Y-Yes, that --
Well, that is true.

907
00:33:26,536 --> 00:33:27,841
Thanks for coming back in.

908
00:33:27,885 --> 00:33:29,191
We just need
to clear something up

909
00:33:29,234 --> 00:33:30,627
about the night Patrick
was killed.

910
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,412
Patrick? I thought this was
about Morris's murder.

911
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:35,284
Oh, it's about both.

912
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:38,765
See, you felt Patrick
was a bad influence on your son.

913
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:40,941
So you flew Aaron to Paris
to separate them.

914
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,466
Only Patrick
followed Aaron there,

915
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:45,642
so you took matters
into your own hands.

916
00:33:45,685 --> 00:33:47,948
You flew to Paris,
you killed Patrick.

917
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,863
But somehow Morris
found out,

918
00:33:49,907 --> 00:33:52,475
so to keep
your deadly secret,

919
00:33:52,518 --> 00:33:53,911
you killed him too.

920
00:33:55,434 --> 00:33:59,003
Yeah,
that's a fun theory --

921
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:01,484
a good story --
but you're wrong.

922
00:34:01,527 --> 00:34:03,225
Then explain
why you went to Paris

923
00:34:03,268 --> 00:34:05,183
and why you kept it
a secret.

924
00:34:05,227 --> 00:34:08,360
Because I was
with Jean-Pierre Darby.

925
00:34:08,404 --> 00:34:09,927
Who?
The footballer?

926
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:13,322
Yes, we met a month before,
at a fashion show in Milan.

927
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:14,671
I'm -- I'm sorry.

928
00:34:14,714 --> 00:34:17,195
You went to Paris for an
international bootie call?

929
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,283
Yes.

930
00:34:18,327 --> 00:34:19,937
And we were in bed
all night.

931
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,286
Ask him.

932
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,854
Hell, ask the neighbors.

933
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:25,986
They were determined
to convict you.

934
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,988
Had it come out
that I was in town,

935
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:29,555
they would've used it
against you,

936
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,341
said that we were conspiring
to kill Patrick.

937
00:34:32,384 --> 00:34:35,518
Coming clean would've only hurt
your case, made it worse.

938
00:34:35,561 --> 00:34:37,911
Yeah, you know what? I forgot
how good you are at that.

939
00:34:37,955 --> 00:34:38,738
At what?

940
00:34:38,782 --> 00:34:40,914
At justifying yourself.

941
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,830
You lied in a murder trial,
you cheated on your husband,

942
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,006
and now you're the hero,
right?

943
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,399
Yeah. Sure, Mom.

944
00:34:47,443 --> 00:34:48,531
We'll go with that.

945
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,451
You accused Aaron's
mother of the murder.

946
00:34:55,494 --> 00:34:57,366
With almost no evidence
to back it up.

947
00:34:57,409 --> 00:34:58,628
I -- I did.

948
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:01,935
And, uh, in my defense,

949
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:04,068
I'd been scrubbing
reality show footage

950
00:35:04,112 --> 00:35:05,939
for over 200 hours
at that point.

951
00:35:05,983 --> 00:35:07,550
So who broke the case?

952
00:35:07,593 --> 00:35:09,029
Oh, that was
Detective Lopez.

953
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,119
My wife is a badass.

954
00:35:11,162 --> 00:35:12,685
We knew the murders
were connected.

955
00:35:12,729 --> 00:35:14,383
And we knew that
Patrick's murder in Paris

956
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:15,732
was never
properly investigated.

957
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:18,169
So I dug
back into that case.

958
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:20,302
Right now I'm just trying
to build a timeline,

959
00:35:20,345 --> 00:35:22,913
getting to know more
about Patrick's life.

960
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,089
What did the four of you do
that last month?

961
00:35:25,133 --> 00:35:26,395
No detail is too small.

962
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:28,484
Um...

963
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:31,182
Let's ask my brain.

964
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:33,271
I can tell you one thing
that we definitely didn't do.

965
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:34,751
Go to class.

966
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:36,796
I mean, Aaron's parents
let him borrow their private jet

967
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,885
anytime he wanted,
so we went all around Europe.

968
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:41,410
I mean, Italy.

969
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:42,411
Greece.

970
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:43,238
French Riviera.

971
00:35:44,326 --> 00:35:45,109
Can I see?

972
00:35:45,153 --> 00:35:46,545
Yeah.

973
00:35:46,589 --> 00:35:48,243
I thought --
screw school,

974
00:35:48,286 --> 00:35:50,462
when am I ever gonna get to
visit planet rich again, right?

975
00:35:50,506 --> 00:35:53,248
So, Santorini
for the weekend?

976
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:54,423
Yes, please.

977
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:56,164
These photos of you guys
on the tarmac,

978
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:58,078
you always have
so much luggage.

979
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,384
I know.

980
00:35:59,428 --> 00:36:01,865
Rowan always acted like
it was the Oregon Trail.

981
00:36:01,908 --> 00:36:03,475
Why?
Every time I've seen him,

982
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:05,347
he was wearing a golf tee
and jeans.

983
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,783
Not exactly
a clotheshorse.

984
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:09,264
Oh, uh...

985
00:36:09,307 --> 00:36:10,482
True.

986
00:36:10,526 --> 00:36:12,092
I wonder
what was in there.

987
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:14,269
Did you ever see Rowan
with drugs back then?

988
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:15,618
I mean -- yeah.

989
00:36:15,661 --> 00:36:17,402
He was always kind of
"the life of the party,"

990
00:36:17,446 --> 00:36:18,490
if you know what I mean.

991
00:36:18,534 --> 00:36:20,231
Why?
Before Paris,

992
00:36:20,275 --> 00:36:22,799
Rowan's family in Iowa
was in financial trouble.

993
00:36:22,842 --> 00:36:24,192
He almost dropped
out of school.

994
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:26,716
Now he lives in Brentwood
and drives a Porsche.

995
00:36:26,759 --> 00:36:28,544
I guess?

996
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:31,242
I -- I see
you're very excited,

997
00:36:31,286 --> 00:36:33,549
and I love that --
I -- I'm not really following.

998
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,637
I...

999
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:37,248
Hey, Nolan.

1000
00:36:37,292 --> 00:36:38,554
Where's Rowan?

1001
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:40,077
Uh, he just left.

1002
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,644
Why? I thought
you were done with him?

1003
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:43,646
I was -- until I realized
he's the one who killed Patrick.

1004
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:47,825
Alright. Here we go.
Here we go.

1005
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:49,261
Nice, nice.

1006
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:50,436
Bro, it's been crazy.

1007
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,655
I've added like
half a million followers

1008
00:36:51,698 --> 00:36:53,309
from all the publicity.

1009
00:36:53,352 --> 00:36:55,833
What? You think, uh --
You think, uh, Aaron did it?

1010
00:36:55,876 --> 00:36:56,877
Pbht. Of course he did.

1011
00:36:56,921 --> 00:36:58,401
The guy's a total psycho.

1012
00:36:58,444 --> 00:36:59,663
Okay, watch this --

1013
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,582
Aw. Fudge.

1014
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:06,583
Hold on,
I'm gonna do it again --

1015
00:37:06,626 --> 00:37:07,497
Okay, okay.

1016
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,630
Rowan.
What the hell?

1017
00:37:10,674 --> 00:37:12,066
We got a warrant
for your arrest.

1018
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,024
What?

1019
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:14,852
For what?

1020
00:37:14,895 --> 00:37:17,289
For the murders of
Patrick Hayes and Morris Mackey.

1021
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:18,377
Oh, snap.

1022
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:19,944
That's crazy.

1023
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,206
And wrong.

1024
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:23,252
I didn't --
why would you even think that?

1025
00:37:23,295 --> 00:37:24,905
Because Patrick found out
you were smuggling drugs

1026
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:27,343
in Aaron's private jet, and
threatened to tell the police.

1027
00:37:27,386 --> 00:37:29,606
Somehow Morris found out
that you killed Patrick

1028
00:37:29,649 --> 00:37:31,912
to protect your secret,
so you killed him too.

1029
00:37:31,956 --> 00:37:33,174
Come on.
That's -- I mean --

1030
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:34,263
That's so -- so wrong --

1031
00:37:34,306 --> 00:37:35,786
- Hey! Rowan!
- Rowan!

1032
00:37:37,744 --> 00:37:39,006
Okay.
Bro, wait.

1033
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:43,881
- Oh.
- Oh, snap.

1034
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,626
You okay?

1035
00:37:49,669 --> 00:37:51,192
Alright, you're fine.

1036
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:52,716
Stand up.

1037
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:54,326
Put it down.
You're under arrest.

1038
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:57,111
Rowan always had
these crazy plans.

1039
00:37:57,155 --> 00:37:59,244
You know,
"Let's go to Morocco,"

1040
00:37:59,288 --> 00:38:02,203
or, "Dude, I heard about
this sick party in Ibiza..."

1041
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:06,730
And I -- I --
I never thought about it,

1042
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:10,516
but he was the one who decided
where we were flying to always.

1043
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,866
And, you know,
now, looking back at it,

1044
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:16,870
with "cop eyes," I mean,
it is so obvious

1045
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:19,569
that Rowan
was up to something.

1046
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:20,918
I just could never see it.

1047
00:38:22,789 --> 00:38:25,139
I mean,
Patrick did, though.

1048
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,057
But, like, why -- why --
why didn't he tell me, you know?

1049
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:32,321
We talked about everything --
you know, why wouldn't he --

1050
00:38:32,364 --> 00:38:33,844
why wouldn't he tell me
about this?

1051
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,369
You know, if he had...
