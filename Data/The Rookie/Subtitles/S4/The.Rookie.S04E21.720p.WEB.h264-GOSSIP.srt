1
00:00:05,091 --> 00:00:07,267
Previously on "The Rookie"...

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,244
How serious are you about
becoming a training officer?

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,490
Sir, I don't wantto be a T.O.
I'm goingto be a T.O.

4
00:00:12,532 --> 00:00:15,710
This is Sabrina Fowler,
the very talented new actress

5
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:17,103
on "Hot Suspect."

6
00:00:17,146 --> 00:00:19,062
It's a pleasure.

7
00:00:19,105 --> 00:00:20,846
You know, my character,

8
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,934
is having an affair
with a police sergeant.

9
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:24,806
And his wife likes to watch.

10
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,417
Lieutenant Landon Briggs.

11
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,375
- I'm the Union -
- President. - Yes, I know.

12
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:29,960
Nolan. You know what
the best part about

13
00:00:29,984 --> 00:00:31,074
being union president is?

14
00:00:31,117 --> 00:00:32,118
Power.

15
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:33,945
The power to help the people
I like

16
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:35,686
and hurt the people I don't.

17
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:02,017
Hey. What, uh...
What seems to be the problem?

18
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,584
Nothing.
Everyone's overreacting.

19
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:06,543
Overreacting to what?

20
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:14,942
Not it.

21
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:37,617
I'm sorry.
Um, I'm sorry.

22
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:40,098
I-I meant to get up early and...
and make you breakfast.

23
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:41,840
And I had this
whole Mother's Day thing

24
00:01:41,883 --> 00:01:43,102
planned with Jack...

25
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,060
Jack's been up for three hours.

26
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:46,584
I have been up for three hours.

27
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:48,673
Is that cereal in your hair?

28
00:01:48,716 --> 00:01:50,109
And applesauce.

29
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,198
And, somehow,
banana under my boob.

30
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,460
Mm.

31
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:56,376
Okay, so...
how can I fix this?

32
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,465
I need a shower.
Mm-hmm.

33
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,640
And a nap.

34
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:01,206
Uh...

35
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,879
But we have Mother's Day brunch
with your mom later.

36
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,209
Right.

37
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:05,516
Mm.
New plan.

38
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:08,213
Mm-hmm?
Shower, blow-out,

39
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:11,564
mani-pedi, and some mimosas
with Patrice.

40
00:02:11,609 --> 00:02:14,176
Okay, so you're gonna take Jack
to the nail salon.

41
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:18,137
No.
You'retaking Jack.

42
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,853
Right. I just... I have
that thing with a client

43
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:21,313
for the restaurant, remember?

44
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:24,622
Which I'm gonna take Jack to.

45
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,668
I love you.

46
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:28,408
Happy Mother's Day.

47
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:30,193
Mm-hmm.

48
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:36,241
Nolan. Hold up.

49
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:38,810
I got some bad news.

50
00:02:38,853 --> 00:02:40,985
I'm hearing rumors that
the Union President

51
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,248
is gonna make a move
against you.

52
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:44,747
Not a surprise,
given how I showed him up

53
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:46,033
at the City Council.

54
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:47,186
Any idea what he's planning?

55
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,037
Not yet, but I expect the worst.

56
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:51,604
There's no hard rule on
the union delegate count.

57
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:53,259
He can shrink the number by one.

58
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:55,281
And because I was the last one
in, I'd be the first one out.

59
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:56,393
What do I do?

60
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:58,264
You focus on your
T.O. exam next week.

61
00:02:58,307 --> 00:03:00,700
Don't let politics
derail your career.

62
00:03:00,745 --> 00:03:02,504
Oh, no, I've been studying
my ass off. I think I'm ready.

63
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,486
Don't think it.

64
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,792
Be it.

65
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:06,794
Clearly, you don't have
time to waste.

66
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:07,707
Are you calling me old?

67
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:08,752
It was implied.

68
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:12,931
Hey, you know, why don't
I ride with you today?

69
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,082
I can teach you some things that
are not in the study guide.

70
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:16,911
One-on-one time with
a supervisor will strengthen

71
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:18,066
your case for a promotion.

72
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,719
Sir, you don't have
to do that for me.

73
00:03:19,764 --> 00:03:21,243
Nolan, do you
want to be a T.O.?

74
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:23,462
Absolutely.
Then don't do that small-town

75
00:03:23,507 --> 00:03:25,204
"I hate to be a bother" thing.

76
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,162
You're being offered
an opportunity.

77
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:28,163
Take it.

78
00:03:28,206 --> 00:03:30,295
Yes, sir.
And thank you, sir.

79
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,514
You're welcome.

80
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,257
And Luna's okay with
you working Mother's Day?

81
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,997
Yeah. It's the first year
Dominique's not at home.

82
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:40,698
Luna said she's fine
keeping it super low-key.

83
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,307
Oh.

84
00:03:42,352 --> 00:03:43,526
What?

85
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:47,008
Do you think
she's just saying that?

86
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:48,358
No.

87
00:03:52,057 --> 00:03:54,885
Mm...
yeah, that's a hard pass.

88
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:56,365
Look, I'm boycotting
Mother's Day,

89
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:58,368
but even if I wasn't,
I really don't think this is

90
00:03:58,411 --> 00:03:59,933
the right time to meet
your parents.

91
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:01,893
I figured you'd say that.

92
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:03,676
But they've been
hounding me about

93
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,026
meeting you for weeks.

94
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,681
Are you really freezing
your mom out?

95
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:10,944
I mean, I bought her flowers.
I'm not an anarchist.

96
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:12,860
I'm thinking we just
lock in the Hyatt.

97
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:14,316
They have a lazy river.
What else do you need?

98
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,428
Great. You handle that,
I'll book the flights.

99
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:17,778
On it.

100
00:04:17,822 --> 00:04:18,886
Are you guys planning
a vacation?

101
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,259
Yeah. Hawaii.
Oh, I love Hawaii.

102
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:23,610
Actually, I've never been,
but I love the idea.

103
00:04:23,653 --> 00:04:25,917
You'd think I'd be sick of
beaches at this point,

104
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,353
but it's gonna be awesome.

105
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:29,877
I've got to get to work.

106
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,661
Oh, me, too.
I'll walk out with you.

107
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:32,942
Call me if you change your mind.

108
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:35,055
I'm not going to.
Stop.

109
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,622
Change your mind about what?

110
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,625
He wants me to meet his parents.

111
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:40,670
So, uh, whose idea was Hawaii?

112
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,151
Mine, I guess.
Why?

113
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:44,848
I-I thought you had today off.

114
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:47,721
I did, but Donovan
has custody this weekend,

115
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:49,394
and he is punishing me
by taking Lila to see

116
00:04:49,418 --> 00:04:51,420
his mom in Santa Barbara.

117
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:54,553
So I am spending this
Mother's Day without my baby.

118
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:56,643
Wow.
That is cruel, even for him.

119
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,644
Yeah, I know.
And James is taking his boys

120
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:00,646
to see his ex-wife,
because unlike Donovan,

121
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,214
he is an actual
decent human being.

122
00:05:03,257 --> 00:05:06,523
But at least I get paid
time and a half to be here

123
00:05:06,565 --> 00:05:08,829
and plot my revenge.

124
00:05:08,872 --> 00:05:10,613
I can't wait to see
what you come up with.

125
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:12,286
Somebody should sell tickets.

126
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,310
Mm!

127
00:05:17,011 --> 00:05:18,490
Is it crazy I want to be
a T.O.

128
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:19,685
with so little time on the job?

129
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:21,319
No.

130
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,495
Your report writing
is excellent.

131
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,411
You know policy, procedure,

132
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:27,064
and the law well enough
to teach others.

133
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:29,894
But your background
could be a drawback.

134
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:32,548
Every other T.O. knows
what it's like to be a scared,

135
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,725
20-something rookie
because they were one.

136
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,529
And that shared experience
gives them the leg up

137
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:38,598
in teaching that kid.

138
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:39,817
Exactly.

139
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,687
But your experiences being a dad

140
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:43,168
could help bridge the gap.

141
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:44,850
Only my kid was never
armed and dangerous.

142
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,262
So, you really think
Luna's hoping

143
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:52,437
that I do something big
for Mother's Day this year?

144
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:55,136
I think it's always a safe bet
to go the extra mile.

145
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,576
You're right.

146
00:05:59,619 --> 00:06:01,336
We should stop somewhere
so I can get a better gift.

147
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,665
Yes, sir.
Yeah.

148
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:04,189
7-Adam-15.

149
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:06,843
415 in progress
at Gower Studios.

150
00:06:06,887 --> 00:06:08,105
Right after we take this call.

151
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:09,934
Yes, sir.
7-Adam-15.

152
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:11,500
Show us responding.

153
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:13,043
I don't know how many times
I need to say it.

154
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:14,504
Please clean it up, okay?

155
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:15,829
I'm actually triggered by this,
you guys.

156
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:16,959
I don't think you understand.

157
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:18,072
They're here. See?

158
00:06:18,115 --> 00:06:19,682
Oh, Sergeant.

159
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:20,858
Thank God you're here.

160
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:21,858
Ms. Fowler.

161
00:06:21,901 --> 00:06:23,382
Sabrina Fowler.

162
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,949
She's an actress on
"Hot Suspect."

163
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:26,384
I'm pretty sure he knows that.

164
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,778
It's nice to meet you.

165
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,257
Congratulations on the baby.

166
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,495
Unless it's just for the show.

167
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:31,956
Oh, it's both.

168
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,478
They made my character pregnant,

169
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:35,480
so I got pregnant in real life.

170
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:37,134
Because she's a method actor.

171
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:39,877
How else am I gonna
understand the experience?

172
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,836
Wow.

173
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,663
So, what happened here, exactly?

174
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:46,012
We got a call about an assault?

175
00:06:46,057 --> 00:06:49,321
That's right. The girl from
crafty assaulted me...

176
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:51,235
with a crouton.

177
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:52,279
She threw it at you?

178
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:54,281
No.
She put it in my salad.

179
00:06:55,066 --> 00:06:56,786
Do you know how many carbs
are in a crouton?

180
00:06:58,372 --> 00:07:01,375
Right. Um, well,
what was the name of your,

181
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,726
uh... attacker?

182
00:07:03,769 --> 00:07:05,990
Mm, salad girl?
I don't...

183
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:07,947
No. Wait. I heard somebody
call her Monica

184
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,906
while she was
destroying everything.

185
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:11,144
So she made this mess.
That's right.

186
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:12,343
She completely freaked out

187
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:13,713
when I told her I was
gonna have her fired.

188
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,826
For putting a crouton
on your salad?

189
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,305
Are you taking her side?

190
00:07:17,348 --> 00:07:19,481
Of course not.

191
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:20,831
Excuse me.
I have to take this.

192
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:21,875
The D.A.'s office.

193
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:23,615
Tell them I'm okay.
I am okay.

194
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,699
I will still make it to court
for the Sanchez trial.

195
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:29,665
I'm prosecuting
a serial killer later.

196
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:31,276
Oh. On the show.
Right.

197
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,598
But that was actually
the real...

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,542
You know what?
Never mind.

199
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:38,172
Is there anything else you can
tell me about the incident?

200
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,459
Like six people recorded it
on their phones.

201
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,242
We're trending on Cliptalk.

202
00:07:42,286 --> 00:07:43,331
Right.

203
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,072
They're calling her a folk hero.

204
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:47,552
Can you believe it?
As if I'mthe bad guy.

205
00:07:47,596 --> 00:07:49,120
We're needed elsewhere.

206
00:07:49,163 --> 00:07:51,122
Ms. Fowler, I'm gonna have
a unit reach out

207
00:07:51,165 --> 00:07:53,689
to studio security to get
your attacker's information.

208
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,430
I want the book thrown at her.

209
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:57,432
Of course.

210
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:58,824
And happy Mother's Day.

211
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,348
Oh, thank you.

212
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,569
Nice fake phone call.

213
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:04,875
It wasn't fake.

214
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,399
The D.A.'s office has
a witness to secure,

215
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:10,184
and they asked for an advanced
team to assess the site.

216
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:12,548
So I guess Luna's present will
have to wait a while longer?

217
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:16,060
Yeah, but don't let me forget.

218
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,418
Are you proposing to Ashley?

219
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:28,463
What?

220
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,725
Of course not.

221
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:31,137
We... We've only been
dating a few months.

222
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:33,380
Okay.

223
00:08:33,424 --> 00:08:34,904
But if you take
a girl to Hawaii,

224
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,820
there's gonna be expectations.

225
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,232
You might not be aware of some
of the signals that you're sending.

226
00:08:39,256 --> 00:08:40,519
What kind of signals?

227
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,278
The kind that makes her get
a manicure because

228
00:08:42,302 --> 00:08:44,063
she's assuming she'll be
sending pictures of her hand

229
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:45,350
to all her friends.

230
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:48,440
7-Adam-100.

231
00:08:48,482 --> 00:08:49,962
What's your status?

232
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:51,878
Uh, 7-Adam-100.

233
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,097
Show us Code 6 on our 415.

234
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,838
- They lost her keys.
- Where are my keys?

235
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:57,841
Sir, please.
You lost my Bentley.

236
00:08:57,884 --> 00:09:00,582
No, sir, I just... I just don't
know where the keys are.

237
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:01,951
Okay, everyone, just calm down.
Back up a little bit, please.

238
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,106
Thank you.

239
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,890
What's going on? Jonah went crazy.

240
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:06,676
He punched that guy in the face,

241
00:09:06,719 --> 00:09:09,504
and he emptied the key cabinet
and then stole a car.

242
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,700
Patrol, we need an R.A. at our
location for an assault victim.

243
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:13,465
Jonah is a valet?

244
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:15,466
Yeah, yeah.
He just started last week.

245
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:17,600
At first, he was amused
by all the rich guests.

246
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:19,186
You know how petty
and demanding they are.

247
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,820
No offense.

248
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:23,015
But when that dude told him to
move his ass, he snapped.

249
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,868
Knocked the guy out,
jumped into his Porsche,

250
00:09:24,911 --> 00:09:26,826
and took off with
all the car keys.

251
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,263
And what color is the Porsche?

252
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:31,197
So all you did was reach
inside of an open car window

253
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:33,224
and take a bag of chips
from the passenger seat.

254
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:34,659
Yes.

255
00:09:34,703 --> 00:09:36,662
I was super hungry,
and it was right there.

256
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,970
Are you allowed to bring
a baby in here?

257
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,581
Oh, he's my intern.

258
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,864
So, why is the District Attorney
adding these extra charges?

259
00:09:44,888 --> 00:09:46,629
Burglary and vehicle tampering.

260
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:48,606
You're looking at the one
who didn'tgo to law school.

261
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,110
I have no idea.

262
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:53,897
The ADA in charge of your case
is Philip Harmon.

263
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,855
He's notorious for
up-charging defendants.

264
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,379
Is there anything
you can do about it?

265
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,903
Uh... not much.

266
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:02,576
He does it to force you
to take a plea deal

267
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,664
while he looks tough on crime.

268
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:05,255
That doesn't seem fair.

269
00:10:06,561 --> 00:10:08,041
It's not.

270
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,782
I'll get right into this.
Hang tight.

271
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,610
Come on, buddy.
Thanks.

272
00:10:12,306 --> 00:10:15,352
If you want, I could watch
the baby while you work.

273
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:18,485
Not sure how my wife would feel
about that, but thank you.

274
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,226
Come on, buddy.

275
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,323
No breakfast in bed, but Wesley
did get me this bracelet.

276
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:32,979
That's lovely.

277
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:34,980
It's no diamond tennis bracelet,

278
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:37,027
but I don't need him
to show me his love

279
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,375
with extravagant gifts.

280
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:41,161
Well, no one needs it,
but wouldn't it be nice?

281
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,600
Wesley's running even later.

282
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,775
Oh.
We should order.

283
00:10:46,818 --> 00:10:48,428
It's probably for the best.

284
00:10:48,472 --> 00:10:50,431
Rich-people stuff isn't
as fun when he's around.

285
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:53,696
No, he does tend
to dampen the mood.

286
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:56,263
How about you and I spend
the afternoon shopping?

287
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:58,221
I'll hire a driver,

288
00:10:58,264 --> 00:11:00,179
and we'll do your
first Mother's Day right.

289
00:11:00,224 --> 00:11:02,095
I love you.

290
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:03,879
Yes.
Cheers to that.

291
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:05,054
Cheers.

292
00:11:07,057 --> 00:11:09,232
Good morning,
and happy Mother's Day.

293
00:11:09,275 --> 00:11:11,801
Now, I hate to interrupt
your little manufactured

294
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:14,716
family gathering,
but this is a robbery.

295
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,110
Let's go. Everyone stay calm
and you won't get hurt.

296
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:19,111
Just put all your belongings
in the bag.

297
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:20,331
What are you gonna do?

298
00:11:20,374 --> 00:11:21,724
Stay calm.
Do as they say.

299
00:11:21,767 --> 00:11:22,875
We don't want to make
the situation worse.

300
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:25,030
Come on, cough it up, ladies.

301
00:11:25,075 --> 00:11:27,120
Yeah.
That's beautiful.

302
00:11:27,163 --> 00:11:28,469
Thank you.

303
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,775
Give me the pearls.

304
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,038
Please.

305
00:11:33,082 --> 00:11:34,301
My late husband gave me...

306
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,649
I don't care.

307
00:11:35,693 --> 00:11:37,652
Put it in the bag before
I rip it off your neck.

308
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,307
Patrice, we'll
get it back, okay?

309
00:11:41,787 --> 00:11:43,634
You know, you really shouldn't
lie to your elders.

310
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:46,096
I'm not lying
when I tell her that.

311
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:49,751
Or when I tell you
you're under arrest.

312
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,407
You know, I love the confidence.

313
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:56,496
But, uh... we're the only ones
with guns here.

314
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,412
Oh, I don't mean now.

315
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:01,216
But soon enough, we'll be putting
a different kind of bracelet on you.

316
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:07,769
Thank you! Monica: Whoo!

317
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,815
I'll take that.

318
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,321
Thanks, everybody!
We love you!

319
00:12:16,822 --> 00:12:17,996
Hey. You okay?

320
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:19,825
Yeah.
Did Wesley find you?

321
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:21,000
He's been frantic.

322
00:12:21,043 --> 00:12:22,306
I know.

323
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:24,229
Patrice and I had to
scrape him off the ceiling.

324
00:12:24,264 --> 00:12:26,875
I sent him and Jack away
so I could go to work.

325
00:12:26,918 --> 00:12:27,940
Did you get an I.D.
on the stick-up team?

326
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,530
Yep. Jonah Cahill,
Monica Ditmar.

327
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,316
That's our valet.

328
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,578
He beat up a guest this morning
and stole a Porsche.

329
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,450
Oh, and that's the woman
that Nolan and Grey

330
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:37,755
put out a BOLO for.

331
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,584
She pitched a fit
at one of the stars

332
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,106
on "Hot Suspect" and then quit.

333
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,456
Which suggests the robbery was
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

334
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,937
Yeah. They might have
snapped after a bad morning

335
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:47,765
at work and decided
that crime paid better.

336
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,462
I'm assuming they
have criminal records?

337
00:12:49,506 --> 00:12:53,119
Yeah. Minor offenses stretching
back into their teens.

338
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,294
They're both living at
a halfway house in Koreatown.

339
00:12:55,338 --> 00:12:57,907
I got uniforms parked outside
in case they come back.

340
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,604
They stole your
Mother's Day's present?

341
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:01,126
I'm going to get it back.

342
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:03,173
Damn right you are.
And I am gonna help you.

343
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,336
Nobody messes with Mother's Day
and gets away with it.

344
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:08,481
Donovan took Lila out of town.

345
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:09,918
What?
Mm-hmm.

346
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,659
I knew he was an ass, but
I didn't think he was evil.

347
00:13:12,703 --> 00:13:15,967
My abuela taught me the perfect
curse to put on him.

348
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:18,623
Ooh!
Does it involve boils?

349
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:21,365
No, but parts of him
will definitely fall off.

350
00:13:21,408 --> 00:13:22,932
Ooh! Okay, we should leave before

351
00:13:22,975 --> 00:13:24,933
we become accessories.Mm-hmm.

352
00:13:24,976 --> 00:13:27,197
Those robbers
don't stand a chance.

353
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,509
Here we are.

354
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:38,076
The Royal Arms apartments.

355
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,706
D.A.'s office is gonna
secure their witness here

356
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,775
for a week while they get
a more permanent situation

357
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,081
put in place.

358
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,996
That must be tough
going into WITSEC.

359
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,582
I mean, I changed my whole
life to come out here,

360
00:13:46,606 --> 00:13:48,913
but I didn't have to
cut ties with my family.

361
00:13:48,957 --> 00:13:49,914
This poor guy's gonna
have to give up

362
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,350
everything he's ever known.

363
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:54,005
This "poor guy" is
a runner for a street gang.

364
00:13:54,049 --> 00:13:56,442
He stood by and watched
people get murdered.

365
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:58,619
He's lucky his testimony
is valuable enough

366
00:13:58,663 --> 00:14:00,186
to get him immunity.

367
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,684
So, what do we have to do
to get the site prepped

368
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,188
for witness protection?

369
00:14:03,232 --> 00:14:06,235
First, the C.I. needs to be
given clear boundaries,

370
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,673
the landmarks that he cannot
cross, to keep him isolated.

371
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:12,284
Okay, how about Sixth Street
to the north,

372
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:13,851
that grocery store to the south?

373
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,177
That way, there's lots
of cameras and witnesses

374
00:14:15,201 --> 00:14:16,462
in case anything happens.

375
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:18,161
That's perfect.

376
00:14:18,203 --> 00:14:19,857
Let's go check out
this apartment.

377
00:14:23,121 --> 00:14:24,818
Looks like nobody's been
here in a while.

378
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:26,865
Still have to clear it anyway.

379
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:32,043
Okay. Search for cameras
and listening devices.

380
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,653
Hold the button down,

381
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:37,179
wave it over anything
that may hide a bug.

382
00:14:37,222 --> 00:14:38,442
Gotcha.

383
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:42,097
What was your FTO like?

384
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,250
He was one of those guys
who thought he could

385
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:47,320
motivate me with threats.

386
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:49,713
One night, he drove me
behind the grocery store,

387
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:52,543
took off his belt and vest,
and wanted to fight.

388
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:53,673
What did you do?

389
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:55,371
I put him in the hospital.

390
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:57,243
He tread a lot more carefully
after that.

391
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,418
I bet he did.

392
00:14:58,461 --> 00:15:00,289
Check the bedroom.

393
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,947
There's four types of
training officers...

394
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,471
Kings, Coaches,
Teachers, and Slugs.

395
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:10,604
Well, I already know
the Slug one.

396
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:13,606
That one's just doing it
for the pay bump.

397
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,480
Kings are the
"my way or the highway" type.

398
00:15:16,523 --> 00:15:18,350
Coaches offer motivation,

399
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:20,352
and Teachers always want to
explain everything.

400
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:22,355
Which of the categories
do I fit under?

401
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,226
None.

402
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:26,403
That's why you got the potential
to make a great T.O.

403
00:15:26,446 --> 00:15:28,971
Take the best qualities of
all the leaders and trainers

404
00:15:29,014 --> 00:15:31,321
who shaped who you are as a cop,

405
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,844
and you'll make
your own category.

406
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:40,547
Del Monte.

407
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:41,984
Site's secure.

408
00:15:42,027 --> 00:15:43,681
So, you need us to hang around?

409
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:45,552
'Cause I got a Mother's Day
present to buy.

410
00:15:45,596 --> 00:15:47,182
Oh, it's a little late
for that, isn't it?

411
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:48,860
Yeah.

412
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:50,316
Yeah, actually, I would
appreciate you hanging out.

413
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:52,341
Uh, my guy is super twitchy.

414
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,058
Having you there play the heavy
will definitely help

415
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:55,363
him play by the rules, you know?

416
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,780
No problem.

417
00:16:05,964 --> 00:16:07,573
Hey, Sean.

418
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:08,445
Got a minute?

419
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:10,229
Uh, yeah, one.

420
00:16:11,317 --> 00:16:13,188
Cute kid.

421
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:15,799
Oh, hey, you're working
on Lopez's first Mother's Day.

422
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,583
Brave man.

423
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:19,499
Yeah, in my defense,
she's working, too.

424
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:22,024
She and my mom were robbed
at brunch.

425
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:23,566
Yeah, I heard about that.
Everybody okay?

426
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,331
Yeah. Thank God.

427
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,961
I should have been there,
but I was dealing with

428
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:30,119
yet another case of
prosecutorial overreach.

429
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,533
Well, if that's your way of
buttering me up for a favor,

430
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:34,707
you might want to rethink it.

431
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:36,144
Gemma Ramp stole
a bag of potato chips,

432
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:37,667
you guys are charging her
with a felony?

433
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:39,278
Oh, yeah, no, that's not mine.
That's Harmon's.

434
00:16:39,302 --> 00:16:41,129
I know.
Hoping you'd talk to him.

435
00:16:41,173 --> 00:16:45,177
Yeah, I mean, I can,
but it's not gonna matter.

436
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:46,918
That's just his way
of doing business.

437
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:48,354
Come on, Wes.
None of this is new.

438
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:50,399
I know.

439
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:52,750
It just seems like things
are only getting worse.

440
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:57,101
Look, you're not wrong.

441
00:16:57,145 --> 00:17:00,932
But to be honest,
I'm surrounded by lawyers

442
00:17:00,975 --> 00:17:02,846
who think that being
tough on crime

443
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,500
is gonna get them the top job.

444
00:17:04,544 --> 00:17:06,807
Hell, I've been vetting candidates for
Kelly's open spot,

445
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:08,262
and each one is
more gung ho than the last.

446
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:09,896
I get it.

447
00:17:09,941 --> 00:17:13,336
My client is steps away
from the street.

448
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:17,252
She needs a break,
not the book thrown at her.

449
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:19,255
I get it. I do.

450
00:17:19,298 --> 00:17:21,299
I just... There's nothing
I can do about it.

451
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,474
My hands are tied.
I'm sorry.

452
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:24,086
I gotta run.

453
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,049
I already know
what you're gonna say.

454
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:33,896
My mother's just trying to do
what's best for me.

455
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:36,141
Oh, no.

456
00:17:36,184 --> 00:17:38,577
Your mom sounds like
a real piece of work.

457
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:42,278
It's not your job
to make amends.

458
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,366
It's hers.

459
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,368
Thank you so much.

460
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:47,847
I...
Yeah.

461
00:17:47,892 --> 00:17:50,547
Okay, when did hotels
get so expensive?

462
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:52,548
Hi.
Hi, Tim.

463
00:17:52,592 --> 00:17:54,811
Oh, that's pretty good. Seriously?

464
00:17:54,855 --> 00:17:56,988
Yeah. I mean,
it's a nice hotel.

465
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,510
If you want to do
better than that,

466
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:01,210
you're gonna have to take
Ashley to Honolulu Motel 6.

467
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:02,993
Oh, you're going to Hawaii.

468
00:18:03,037 --> 00:18:05,431
Congratulations
on your engagement.

469
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:06,911
Ah! Told you.

470
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,391
I'm not getting engaged.

471
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:09,913
Does your girlfriend know that?

472
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,872
Yes.
It's not an issue.

473
00:18:11,915 --> 00:18:13,656
Is he really this clueless?

474
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,487
Yes, trust me.
It is a daily struggle.

475
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,270
Let's go.

476
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,271
You've reached the cellphone of

477
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,490
Detective Angela Lopez.

478
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,578
Leave a message.

479
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:24,145
Any luck?

480
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:26,191
No.

481
00:18:26,234 --> 00:18:30,194
I called half the phones
they stole, including mine.

482
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:31,413
Straight to voicemail.

483
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:33,285
I've got plainclothes
officers stationed

484
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:35,001
at all of the pawnshops
this side of the 405.

485
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:36,983
If they show up,
we will be waiting.

486
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,116
Tell them I want to be the one
who puts on the cuffs.

487
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:41,163
I made a promise.

488
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:42,990
I love it so much.

489
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:45,210
New phone, who dis?

490
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:49,474
Detective Lopez.
We met this morning.

491
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,173
It's the cop
from the restaurant.

492
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:52,826
What's up, Detective?

493
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:54,349
You, uh, calling to arrest us?

494
00:18:54,393 --> 00:18:56,432
'Cause I don't think you can
do that over the phone.

495
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:59,330
No, I'm calling to tell you
to turn yourselves in.

496
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:00,964
You committed armed robbery.

497
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:02,531
Half the LAPD
is looking for you.

498
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,229
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

499
00:19:04,272 --> 00:19:06,076
See, we've got this whole
crime spree planned out.

500
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:07,382
Isn't that right, baby? That's right.

501
00:19:07,405 --> 00:19:09,756
Listen, I know you two
have gone through a lot.

502
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:12,324
Please. If you think reading
a file gives you any idea

503
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:14,239
who we are,
you are a terrible cop.

504
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:16,240
Trust me, I've read enough
files to understand

505
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:18,374
that you and Jonah never
caught a single break.

506
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,593
Yet, when you got out of prison,

507
00:19:20,636 --> 00:19:23,291
you tried to go straight,
even got yourselves real jobs.

508
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:26,076
Yeah. And you know what?
We were still treated like scum.

509
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:28,297
Not even worth
an ounce of respect.

510
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,646
Angela, they are live-streaming
your conversation.

511
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,823
You can save
the false empathy, Detective.

512
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:36,130
Today is for every worker
who's ever been mistreated...

513
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:37,194
Mm.
...for anyone who's ever

514
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,436
wanted to walk off the job.

515
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,134
Yeah, for anybody that
believed the lie

516
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:42,006
that if you just tried
to work harder,

517
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:43,268
you could achieve your dreams.

518
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:45,269
We are done begging for scraps.

519
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:48,055
Today, we are taking
what's ours.

520
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:49,622
Let's take it all, baby.

521
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:51,189
We are taking it.

522
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:52,320
Let's take it all.

523
00:19:53,757 --> 00:19:55,061
I love you.
I love you.

524
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:04,115
Man, I don't like this place.
It's claustrophobic.

525
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:05,421
Mr. Tran...

526
00:20:05,463 --> 00:20:08,597
Is it just me,
or is it dusty up in here?

527
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,903
I feel like I can't breathe.

528
00:20:09,946 --> 00:20:11,122
Daniel, sit down.

529
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,231
If you want to stay alive,
you need to listen to what

530
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,692
Mr. Del Monte
has to say.

531
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,259
Thank you.

532
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,304
As an informant
in our protection program,

533
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:21,698
there are a number of rules
that you will follow.

534
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,961
You will not disclose
this location to anybody.

535
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:26,484
Do you understand?
Good.

536
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:28,138
This is your new phone.

537
00:20:28,182 --> 00:20:30,836
Do not share this number
with anybody.

538
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:32,925
Officer Nolan and Sergeant Grey

539
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,277
have established
a strict perimeter in the area.

540
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:37,409
This is a boundary
that you will not cross

541
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:38,932
under any circumstances.

542
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:40,412
Is that clear?

543
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:42,458
But I can visit my mom, right?

544
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,503
No. Daniel...

545
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:48,463
you are not to contact
any friends or family, period.

546
00:20:48,507 --> 00:20:50,203
But it's Mother's Day.

547
00:20:50,248 --> 00:20:51,607
We're going
horseback riding later.

548
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,598
Son, you're clearly
not understanding

549
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,123
the severity of the situation.

550
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,387
You will not contact anyone,
family included.

551
00:20:59,431 --> 00:21:01,780
But I have to.
I can't let her down again.

552
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:04,958
Look, this is for
her safety, too.

553
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:07,961
Okay, if you really want
to see your mom,

554
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:10,049
I'm sure we can arrange to
have you both meet

555
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:11,313
in a secure location.

556
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:12,269
You can say your goodbyes.

557
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,271
Goodbyes? No.

558
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,317
Daniel, this is
your reality now.

559
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:17,710
I know it's not pretty,

560
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:19,972
but it's the only way we can
keep you alive.

561
00:21:25,021 --> 00:21:26,327
Alright, thanks, guys.

562
00:21:26,371 --> 00:21:27,608
We'll take it from here.
Appreciate it.

563
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:29,895
Present time?
Yeah.

564
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,072
Only I have absolutely
no idea what to get her.

565
00:21:32,115 --> 00:21:33,726
Well, lucky enough,
we got four hours

566
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:35,118
to figure something out.

567
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:36,836
I got an update
on Monica and Jonah.

568
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:38,688
They just robbed a bridal store.

569
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,037
That's an odd choice.

570
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,473
They assaulted the owner
and held her at gunpoint

571
00:21:42,518 --> 00:21:44,127
while Monica tried on dresses.

572
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:46,739
Oh, well, I guess you won't
be the only one getting married.

573
00:21:46,782 --> 00:21:47,784
What?

574
00:21:47,826 --> 00:21:49,654
Nothing. Ignore her.

575
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,917
We need to catch these two
before they kill somebody.

576
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:54,243
Well, given the fact that they
made off with a dress and tux,

577
00:21:54,268 --> 00:21:55,965
odds are they're
about to get hitched.

578
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:57,116
Alright.
We'll alert the local venues

579
00:21:57,141 --> 00:21:58,837
and check out
the obvious locations.

580
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:02,426
Okay, I'm starting to
panic a little.

581
00:22:02,451 --> 00:22:04,452
Luna and I have been
married 25 years.

582
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:06,895
At this point, I've given her
every kind of present there is.

583
00:22:08,631 --> 00:22:10,327
So how do I make
this one special?

584
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,895
Well, maybe don't
make it about the present.

585
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:14,070
Make it about the evening.

586
00:22:14,114 --> 00:22:16,377
What's her favorite restaurant?

587
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,162
Do you think I can
get a reservation

588
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,468
anywhere at this point?

589
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,671
Ooh.
No, not a chance in hell.

590
00:22:21,991 --> 00:22:23,993
Sean, what's up?

591
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,563
No, we're on it.

592
00:22:27,605 --> 00:22:28,999
Daniel Tran took off.

593
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,826
That was fast.
Yeah.

594
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:32,718
Lucky for us, we know
exactly where he's heading.

595
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:35,353
Oh! According to this
travel website,

596
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:38,311
Siberia is the least romantic
place to vacation.

597
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:43,099
I am not rerouting our trip
to the arctic tundra

598
00:22:43,143 --> 00:22:45,798
because you think Hawaii
sends the wrong message.

599
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:48,105
No, it is not just me, okay?

600
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:51,586
TouristPlanet says that
Hawaii is number one

601
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:53,893
for proposals in 2021.

602
00:22:53,936 --> 00:22:56,374
Ashley can't possibly
think I'm proposing.

603
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:57,461
Why not?

604
00:22:57,506 --> 00:23:00,160
I mean, you're of
a... certain age.

605
00:23:00,203 --> 00:23:01,683
She's in her prime.

606
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:05,035
I mean, on paper, it's...
it's like a no-brainer.

607
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:06,557
Okay, be honest.

608
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:10,213
Can you see yourself
married to her?

609
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,263
Yeah.

610
00:23:17,307 --> 00:23:18,308
I can.

611
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,056
7-Adam-100.

612
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:27,536
I have a 415 unknown in progress

613
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:29,058
at Church of the Chimes.

614
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:30,210
That's gotta be Jonah
and Monica.

615
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,757
Show us responding.

616
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,455
Send backup, metro,
and alert Detective Lopez.

617
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:39,025
Hey, hey!
Hey, everyone. Be cool.

618
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:40,567
You can get back to your wedding
in a few minutes.

619
00:23:40,592 --> 00:23:42,898
We wrote our own vows,
so if anybody ruins them,

620
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:44,552
they catch a bullet, understand?

621
00:23:44,596 --> 00:23:47,598
H-Hey, hey, hey. And you...
And if you screw up this video,

622
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,123
it'll mean a world
of pain, alright?

623
00:23:56,215 --> 00:24:00,176
Baby, you are
the love of my life.

624
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,395
Before I met you,
I hated the world.

625
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,137
But now...

626
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:08,794
Now we can hate the world
together forever.

627
00:24:08,837 --> 00:24:12,798
Jonah... you're
my ride or die,

628
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:15,278
the only person who
has ever really seen me.

629
00:24:16,846 --> 00:24:18,455
No matter what happens next,

630
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,762
you've made me
the happiest girl...

631
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,902
Jonah!
Jonah, we gotta go.

632
00:24:29,945 --> 00:24:31,183
Hey, are we officially married?

633
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,208
Yes!

634
00:24:33,644 --> 00:24:35,125
Ah!

635
00:24:35,167 --> 00:24:37,170
7-Adam-100.
Shots fired at our location.

636
00:24:37,213 --> 00:24:39,041
Pursuing armed suspects on foot.

637
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:40,782
We need backup at all exits.

638
00:24:40,826 --> 00:24:41,740
Go, go.
Go to the back.

639
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:42,914
Go. Exit.

640
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:44,394
Move, move.

641
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:17,602
No, no.

642
00:25:17,645 --> 00:25:18,559
No, no, no, no, no.

643
00:25:18,603 --> 00:25:20,212
You gotta leave me.

644
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:21,519
No.

645
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,800
If you leave right now,
you could save yourself.

646
00:25:22,825 --> 00:25:24,434
No.
You could just...

647
00:25:24,478 --> 00:25:25,696
just break me out of jail.

648
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,178
It'll be epic.

649
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:30,615
I love you.

650
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:32,442
I love you, too.

651
00:25:32,486 --> 00:25:34,357
Drop the gun.

652
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,454
Show me your hands.

653
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,546
Run!

654
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:56,728
Suspect Monica Ditmar's
on the loose.

655
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:58,121
She is armed and dangerous,

656
00:25:58,163 --> 00:25:59,402
wearing a wedding dress
and combat boots.

657
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:00,731
You go north.

658
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,229
What's the damage?

659
00:26:19,271 --> 00:26:20,858
GSW through-and-through
to the upper back.

660
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,362
They're prepping
the E.R. now.

661
00:26:22,405 --> 00:26:23,885
You should have
turned yourselves in.

662
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:26,323
I am unrepentant.

663
00:26:26,365 --> 00:26:28,891
I'll be sure to let
the judge know that.

664
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:30,632
The question is,
are you going to help me

665
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:32,285
save Monica's life?

666
00:26:32,328 --> 00:26:34,505
Let me guess.

667
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:35,984
You want me to
tell her to give up?

668
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,682
You're damn right I do.

669
00:26:37,726 --> 00:26:39,137
You think what you're
doing is noble?

670
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:40,816
You think this has
a happy ending?

671
00:26:40,858 --> 00:26:43,339
Grow up.
You shot at cops.

672
00:26:43,383 --> 00:26:46,691
A thousand police officers
are hunting for your wife

673
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:49,172
as we speak,
and when they catch her

674
00:26:49,214 --> 00:26:51,042
and she tries to shoot her way
to freedom,

675
00:26:51,086 --> 00:26:53,088
she's not gonna survive.

676
00:26:53,132 --> 00:26:56,527
So you're gonna record a message
telling her to surrender.

677
00:26:56,569 --> 00:27:00,051
Or wake up from surgery to
the news that you're a widower.

678
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,145
Forget it.

679
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,409
Our entire lives,
we've been ordered around.

680
00:27:09,452 --> 00:27:11,813
I'm not just gonna be another
person telling her what to do.

681
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:13,892
The O.R.'s ready.

682
00:27:13,935 --> 00:27:15,459
Go ahead.
I'm done with him.

683
00:27:16,894 --> 00:27:18,027
Let's move.

684
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:26,644
I can't tell you how much
your advice means to me.

685
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:27,950
Thank you.

686
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:29,820
Of course, Quigley.

687
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:32,171
And, remember, whenever
you're feeling low,

688
00:27:32,214 --> 00:27:35,479
just tell yourself
those three words.

689
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:36,827
I'm worth it.

690
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:40,135
Can I call you "mom"?

691
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:42,703
I think it's better
if you didn't.

692
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,443
Okay. Thanks again.

693
00:27:47,664 --> 00:27:49,101
I'm worth it.

694
00:27:49,144 --> 00:27:50,624
Okay.

695
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:51,407
Ready to go?

696
00:27:51,451 --> 00:27:53,105
Yes. Thank you.

697
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:55,759
You've had quite
a day, haven't you?

698
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:58,284
Are you gonna be a lawyer
like your daddy, huh?

699
00:27:58,327 --> 00:28:00,982
Jackson, are you gonna help
the less fortunate?

700
00:28:01,026 --> 00:28:03,549
Mm. Not sure how much
I'm helping these days.

701
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:05,203
Why? What happened?

702
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,031
I'm just tired of
the uphill battle.

703
00:28:07,076 --> 00:28:08,730
Prosecutors have all the power.

704
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:10,339
Well, if you can't beat them...

705
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:11,471
Join them?

706
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:12,777
No. Unh-unh.

707
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,170
Why not?

708
00:28:14,212 --> 00:28:16,388
Are you telling me
that you wouldn't make

709
00:28:16,432 --> 00:28:19,174
a bigger impact
if you had that power?

710
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:38,802
If Daniel told us about
his Mother's Day plans,

711
00:28:38,846 --> 00:28:40,761
how many others did he tell?

712
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:42,957
It only takes one
to give him up to his gang.

713
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,201
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

714
00:28:46,244 --> 00:28:47,656
You're lucky I'm not putting
you in cuffs right now.

715
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:49,770
I know. I'm sorry.

716
00:28:49,814 --> 00:28:51,250
Go say goodbye to your mother.

717
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:52,948
We need to get you back
to the apartment.

718
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:54,882
Come on. Can't I just spend
the rest of the day with my mom?

719
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:56,342
No!

720
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:58,823
You're an informant
in a gang murder trial.

721
00:28:58,866 --> 00:29:00,651
There are people trying
to kill you.

722
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:03,219
By being here, you're putting
you and your mother in danger.

723
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:09,268
You're right.
I'll go with you.

724
00:29:09,311 --> 00:29:12,141
But, please, you can't
tell her why you're here.

725
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,532
Excuse me?

726
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:15,404
My mom doesn't know...
about the gang,

727
00:29:15,448 --> 00:29:17,189
about witness protection,
any of it.

728
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:19,017
Okay, she's going to find out.

729
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,472
I know, but I just don't
want to ruin her day.

730
00:29:20,497 --> 00:29:21,366
Please.

731
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:22,846
Fine, fine.

732
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:25,284
Hi.
What's going on?

733
00:29:26,111 --> 00:29:29,767
Don't worry, Mom.
This is just about, uh... my car.

734
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,508
It got stolen.

735
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,815
Oh, no, Daniel.
That's terrible.

736
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,859
You just bought it. I know.

737
00:29:35,903 --> 00:29:38,123
But I didn't want to
worry you today.

738
00:29:38,166 --> 00:29:40,385
You know who did it?

739
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,300
Uh... yes, ma'am.

740
00:29:42,345 --> 00:29:44,477
That's why we need your son
to come with us...

741
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,566
so he can view the lineup.

742
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:49,439
I didn't know you
really did that.

743
00:29:49,481 --> 00:29:51,833
Oh, yeah, all the time.
Vital part of police work.

744
00:30:03,974 --> 00:30:05,454
Okay, charade's over.

745
00:30:05,498 --> 00:30:06,657
What's going on?
Who are they?

746
00:30:07,586 --> 00:30:08,849
They're here to kill your son.

747
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:10,199
What? We need to find cover.

748
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,114
Take mom, watch your backstop.

749
00:30:12,156 --> 00:30:13,462
Daniel. Make sure the horses

750
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:14,786
don't get hit in the cross fire.

751
00:31:24,142 --> 00:31:25,664
Thank you for the assist.

752
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:27,318
You're welcome.

753
00:31:27,363 --> 00:31:28,493
On your knees.

754
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:29,712
Where's Daniel?

755
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:32,280
He took off.

756
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:35,500
Sarge, I think we got one more
guy to worry about.

757
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:37,502
I'll stay with the suspect.
You go find Daniel.

758
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:39,069
Yes, sir. I'm going with you.

759
00:31:39,114 --> 00:31:41,420
Uh, Mrs. Tran, thank you.
I-I-I've got this.

760
00:31:41,463 --> 00:31:42,987
He got it. He got it.

761
00:31:56,392 --> 00:31:59,089
I know you came in here, Daniel.

762
00:32:03,137 --> 00:32:05,704
The longer you make me
hunt for you...

763
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:11,015
...the more times
I'm gonna shoot you.

764
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:17,979
It's a shame. I thought you were
a stand-up guy.

765
00:32:19,632 --> 00:32:24,375
But you flipped the second
you felt the handcuffs go on.

766
00:32:33,124 --> 00:32:35,734
Give me your hands.
Give me your hands.

767
00:32:35,778 --> 00:32:37,127
Come on.

768
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:38,173
Get up.

769
00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:40,131
Daniel, it's safe to come out.

770
00:32:44,482 --> 00:32:46,136
Come on.

771
00:33:15,513 --> 00:33:16,950
Hey, hon.

772
00:33:16,993 --> 00:33:19,344
Yeah, I'm on duty
at the hospital.

773
00:33:33,923 --> 00:33:36,144
Come on, baby.
We gotta go.

774
00:33:37,362 --> 00:33:38,667
Don't move.

775
00:33:38,711 --> 00:33:40,278
W-Where's Jonah?

776
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:41,429
He's in the ICU.
They think he'll pull through.

777
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:42,759
Now get your hands up.

778
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,284
I promised I'd put
some bracelets on you,

779
00:33:46,327 --> 00:33:47,546
and I keep my promises.

780
00:33:49,592 --> 00:33:52,421
But, first, this is mine.

781
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,077
Turn around.

782
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:01,691
Come on.

783
00:34:04,998 --> 00:34:07,131
That was a crazy day.Mm.

784
00:34:07,174 --> 00:34:08,456
I can't believe Daniel's mom
is going into

785
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,047
witness protection with him.

786
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:13,485
She loves him, and he clearly
still needs her.

787
00:34:13,528 --> 00:34:15,574
Thank you for
the one-on-one time today.

788
00:34:15,617 --> 00:34:16,967
I really did learn a lot.

789
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,010
You're welcome.

790
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,838
And for what it's worth,

791
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:22,103
I think you're a really good
candidate for FTO.

792
00:34:22,146 --> 00:34:24,626
And I'll tell them that
after you pass your exam.

793
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,106
Thank you.
Yeah.

794
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,630
Ooh!

795
00:34:27,672 --> 00:34:29,128
You still didn't get
anything for Luna.

796
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:31,547
Actually, I did.
You just didn't notice.

797
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,157
Which means it's a good thing

798
00:34:33,201 --> 00:34:35,115
you're not trying
to be a detective.

799
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,900
Well, what'd you get her?

800
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,342
It is time to go home.

801
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:46,692
I have Indian food on the way.

802
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:47,998
Where's Jack?

803
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,521
Uh, my mom took him
to Fred Segal.

804
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:50,782
She's gonna meet us at home.

805
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:53,221
That kid has a better
wardrobe than I do.

806
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,014
I'm thinking of changing jobs.

807
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:05,146
To what?

808
00:35:06,798 --> 00:35:09,280
There's an open spot
in the D.A.'s office.

809
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,065
I am literally without words.

810
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:14,719
You call them the enemy
like four times a week.

811
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:17,027
I know.
Because they are.

812
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,030
And I love advocating for people
that are caught in the system,

813
00:35:20,072 --> 00:35:23,119
but I lose more battles
than I win.

814
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,208
Do you think the D.A. can
look past your suspension?

815
00:35:25,253 --> 00:35:27,429
Considering I helped
put away a major drug lord

816
00:35:27,472 --> 00:35:29,387
in the process, I think so.

817
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:34,175
If there is even
a 10% chance that I can

818
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:38,788
change the system from within,
I have to do it.

819
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:40,398
Don't I?

820
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:41,920
I can't answer that for you.

821
00:35:43,313 --> 00:35:45,838
But we can talk about it
over Indian food.

822
00:35:45,882 --> 00:35:47,405
Deal.

823
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:49,277
Thank you.

824
00:35:51,844 --> 00:35:54,063
I love you. I love you, too.

825
00:35:54,106 --> 00:35:56,021
Hey, I'm about to head out.
You good?

826
00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:57,849
Uh, yeah.
I'm just finishing up.

827
00:35:57,893 --> 00:35:58,677
I'm... I'm right behind you.

828
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:00,331
Okay.
See you tomorrow.

829
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,869
Mommy!

830
00:36:18,306 --> 00:36:21,396
Hi, baby girl.
What are you doing here?

831
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:23,092
Nana brought me.

832
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:25,094
Maris, w-w-what's going on?
Is Donovan okay?

833
00:36:25,137 --> 00:36:26,574
Oh, he's fine.

834
00:36:26,617 --> 00:36:28,639
Except for this really weird
rash that just showed up.

835
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:32,188
That and the fact that I clearly
didn't raise him right.

836
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,931
Keeping a mother from
her child on Mother's Day?

837
00:36:34,974 --> 00:36:37,498
I mean, what is wrong with him?

838
00:36:37,541 --> 00:36:39,195
Thank you.

839
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,458
You don't know how much
that means to me.

840
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:43,286
Yeah, I do.

841
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:46,768
Listen, I-I know
I haven't done a good job

842
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:48,726
of keeping in touch.

843
00:36:48,771 --> 00:36:50,512
No, t-that is not a problem.

844
00:36:50,554 --> 00:36:53,297
I know this whole thing
is complicated.

845
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,476
Yeah, maybe so,
but it doesn't matter

846
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:01,086
what happened between
you and Donovan.

847
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:08,137
You will always be
the daughter I never had.

848
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,804
Hi.
Hi!

849
00:37:22,586 --> 00:37:23,719
Good day?

850
00:37:23,762 --> 00:37:25,329
Yeah, it was okay.

851
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:27,592
Lucy was particularly
annoying, but...

852
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:29,333
I don't believe
that for a second.

853
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:34,077
Hey, I know we said Hyatt,
but I just found

854
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,472
this super-cute Sharebnb
in Ko Olina.

855
00:37:37,514 --> 00:37:38,864
Cozier, right?

856
00:37:38,907 --> 00:37:40,387
Just the two of us?

857
00:37:40,431 --> 00:37:41,650
That's romantic.

858
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,916
Is... Is that, uh...
Is that a new nail color?

859
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:49,744
Yeah.
I just had them done.

860
00:37:49,788 --> 00:37:51,789
Oh.

861
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,139
They're... They're pretty.

862
00:37:54,184 --> 00:37:55,664
Yeah?

863
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,362
Uh, I'm sorry.

864
00:37:58,405 --> 00:38:00,233
Ashley, look.
I-I need to...

865
00:38:00,277 --> 00:38:03,106
I need to clear the air
about something here.

866
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:05,237
The reason Lucy was
so annoying today

867
00:38:05,282 --> 00:38:07,545
is that she is convinced
that you think

868
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:10,068
I'm taking you
to Hawaii to propose.

869
00:38:10,112 --> 00:38:12,463
But, I mean, you don't...
you don't think that, right?

870
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:14,246
'C-Cause I'm not.

871
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:17,032
I mean, I-I think we are
magic together, but I...

872
00:38:17,076 --> 00:38:18,947
Shh!

873
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:21,951
It's okay.

874
00:38:25,563 --> 00:38:29,349
I am not expecting a proposal.

875
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:30,438
Okay.

876
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:33,266
I would say "no" if you asked.

877
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:38,097
Uh, don't get me wrong.
I think we're magic, too.

878
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:42,014
But I just have
no interest in ever

879
00:38:42,057 --> 00:38:43,885
being married or having kids.

880
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:46,844
I'm just not wired that way.

881
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:50,108
Oh.

882
00:38:50,152 --> 00:38:51,284
Okay.

883
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:53,677
Uh, great.

884
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:55,766
It's a vacation.

885
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:56,961
Look, we're gonna have
a great time.

886
00:38:56,985 --> 00:38:58,204
Yes, we will.

887
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:03,775
Will you do me a favor?

888
00:39:13,262 --> 00:39:15,612
Hey.
Oh, hi.

889
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:17,876
So, it's a good thing you
didn't come to meet my mom,

890
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,443
because she drove me
absolutely crazy.

891
00:39:20,487 --> 00:39:21,836
What's wrong?

892
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,664
Nothing. I...

893
00:39:29,844 --> 00:39:31,106
Could you just wait here?

894
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,804
I need to go find Lopez
and figure out

895
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:33,998
how to put a curse on someone.

896
00:39:34,023 --> 00:39:35,590
Yeah, right.

897
00:39:36,503 --> 00:39:37,809
Oh, you're serious.

898
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:40,202
Where are you taking me?

899
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:41,596
Still a surprise.

900
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:43,206
Alright.
My lady.

901
00:39:43,248 --> 00:39:44,400
I didn't cheat.
I'm not peeking.

902
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:45,836
Yeah, okay. Alright. I'm here. I'm ready.

903
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,775
I believe you.

904
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,472
Oh, honey.

905
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,389
I know it's been hard
not having Dominique here.

906
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,478
First Mother's Day without her.

907
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:59,483
So I wanted to do something
special for you.

908
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:01,155
Oh, really?
'Cause I thought those flowers

909
00:40:01,179 --> 00:40:04,139
you sent earlier
was just gonna be it.

910
00:40:04,182 --> 00:40:06,184
That was all
an elaborate ruse, my dear.

911
00:40:06,228 --> 00:40:07,534
Okay.

912
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:10,146
Are you ready?

913
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:11,494
Ready. You ready?

914
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:12,670
I'm ready, I'm ready, yes.

915
00:40:12,713 --> 00:40:13,715
You ready?
Yes.

916
00:40:13,757 --> 00:40:14,778
Alright, here we go.

917
00:40:14,802 --> 00:40:16,413
And voilà.

918
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:19,807
You bought me a horse.

919
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:21,635
No.
Riding lessons.

920
00:40:23,376 --> 00:40:24,552
Oh!

921
00:40:24,594 --> 00:40:28,077
Plus, a romantic
Mother's Day night ride

922
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,686
around the property with me.

923
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:31,601
Sound good?
Yes.

924
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:33,474
I love it.
Oh, thank you.

925
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:35,039
Alright, go.

926
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:37,434
Go play. Go.

927
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,262
Hi.

928
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:40,704
I'm gonna get you to
buy her for me.

929
00:41:01,936 --> 00:41:03,764
Hey!
What a surprise.

930
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:06,027
Come in.
Let me get you a drink.

931
00:41:06,985 --> 00:41:09,684
So... how was
horseback riding?

932
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:11,599
Beautiful.

933
00:41:11,641 --> 00:41:14,949
Wade said that you
helped him find it.

934
00:41:14,992 --> 00:41:16,733
Something like that.

935
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:17,929
But you guys didn't
come all this way

936
00:41:17,952 --> 00:41:19,954
just to thank me for that.

937
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:23,523
No.

938
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:26,309
I just received a formal request

939
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:28,440
to temporarily assign you
to another station.

940
00:41:28,485 --> 00:41:30,181
My first day in the hole.

941
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:31,400
Cool.

942
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:34,795
Not cool?

943
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:37,625
No. This request
is for the whole week.

944
00:41:37,668 --> 00:41:39,277
That means I'll miss
my T.O. exam.

945
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:40,757
Exactly.

946
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:43,500
And before you start
plotting how to sneak back

947
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,936
and take it on your lunch hour,
the station you're going to

948
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:47,722
is four hours away,
on the border.

949
00:41:47,764 --> 00:41:50,072
This is my punishment

950
00:41:50,114 --> 00:41:51,552
for pissing off
the Union President.

951
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:53,204
He knows I want
to be a T.O.

952
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:54,989
Yeah.

953
00:41:55,032 --> 00:41:57,775
Isn't there anything you can do?

954
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:00,429
I would if I could,
but my hands are tied.

955
00:42:00,472 --> 00:42:04,128
If you try to
reject the assignment,

956
00:42:04,172 --> 00:42:07,655
they will consider it
disobeying a direct order.

957
00:42:07,697 --> 00:42:10,440
So even if you pass the test,
they wouldn't make you a T.O.

958
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:12,398
if you're facing
disciplinary action.

959
00:42:14,487 --> 00:42:17,054
Well, then you are just gonna
have to take the next test.

960
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,490
When is it?

961
00:42:18,534 --> 00:42:20,623
In two years.
