1
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:11,387
Bailey:

2
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:12,555
Bailey?

3
00:00:12,556 --> 00:00:13,556
Bailey, you okay?

4
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:17,059
Bailey. Give me your belt.

5
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,686
Your belt. Give me your belt.

6
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:20,229
Control, this is
Detective Lopez.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,814
I have a fully engulfed
structure fire

8
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:24,275
at 1600 Quiet Valley Lane
in Newhall.

9
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:26,068
I need fire rescue and an RA

10
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:28,070
for a woman with a puncture
wound to her left leg.

11
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:29,196
Fred's still in there.

12
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:30,240
Don't move.

13
00:00:33,493 --> 00:00:35,035
We have to help him! Bailey.

14
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:37,037
No one could have survived that.

15
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,749
Bailey, he's gone.

16
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:53,804
Hey, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

17
00:00:53,805 --> 00:00:55,014
I'm fine.

18
00:00:55,015 --> 00:00:56,015
You're not fine. Come on.

19
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:57,933
Back in bed. Back in bed.

20
00:00:57,934 --> 00:00:58,934
Watch your legs.

21
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:00,729
How's the patient?

22
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,021
Did they find Fred?

23
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:03,564
I'm afraid so.

24
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:07,443
His body sustained extensive
damage in the explosion,

25
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:10,070
but the Deputy Fire Chief
made a positive ID.

26
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:11,447
I'm sorry.
I know you were close.

27
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:12,615
I thought we were.

28
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:14,158
Then he turned out to be
a serial killer,

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,702
so it would seem that
the guy I liked

30
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:19,163
was just a disguise
he was wearing.

31
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:20,873
Lopez: Seems like he knew
we were onto him ‐‐

32
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:22,124
wanted to go out
on his own terms ‐‐

33
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,626
one last fire.

34
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:26,170
Hey, you okay?
I heard you got the guy.

35
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,755
Thanks to Nolan and Bailey.

36
00:01:27,756 --> 00:01:29,131
So we need to close out
the case tomorrow.

37
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:30,549
Do you mind
partnering with Lopez?

38
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:31,759
Yeah, whatever you need.

39
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,427
Sarge, I was hoping
I could take the day tomorrow,

40
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:35,179
just to help Bailey
get settled at my place.

41
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,805
I told you I'd be fine
in my apartment.

42
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:38,557
I'm sure you would be,
but I'm not budging on this.

43
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:39,892
I don't want to impose.

44
00:01:39,893 --> 00:01:41,895
It's not an imposition.

45
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:49,568
Okay, here we go.

46
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,236
Watch your step.

47
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:52,780
You're pretty good on those.

48
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,865
Gymnast all through
high school and college.

49
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:58,452
If you can sprain it, twist it,
or dislocate it, I have.

50
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,329
All I want is a couch.

51
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,580
You don't want to go
straight to bed?

52
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:02,915
Not yet.

53
00:02:02,916 --> 00:02:06,210
First, I'm gonna have
a big cry and eat some carbs,

54
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:07,961
probably cry again,

55
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:08,962
then I can sleep.

56
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,047
Okay.

57
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,591
I will get the tissues
and ice cream.

58
00:02:14,344 --> 00:02:15,428
Thank you.

59
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:18,932
You're welcome.

60
00:02:23,186 --> 00:02:25,229
So I rolled a stop sign.
What's the big deal?

61
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,022
No, you ran a red light
and a stop sign,

62
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:28,399
and when we tried to
pull you over,

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,442
you flipped us off and led us on
a medium‐speed pursuit.

64
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:33,404
I was late for an appointment
with Orchid, my life coach.

65
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:34,863
Well, she's doing
a terrible job.

66
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,407
Go stand over there.

67
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:38,785
Is there anything we can do
about this lighting?

68
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:42,079
Hey, so I've been
meaning to talk to you

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,164
about our bet
from the treasure hunt.

70
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,458
The bet I won?
No, the bet I won.

71
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:47,960
I had the gold in my hands.

72
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,421
Because I stopped to arrest
an armed gunman.

73
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:52,047
Eh, technically, I arrested him.

74
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:54,550
All you did was stand there
with your arm out.

75
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:55,844
Which is even more impressive.

76
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:58,178
Sir, what do you think?

77
00:02:58,179 --> 00:02:59,097
What?

78
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:00,180
You okay, sir?

79
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,181
Something wrong
with the booking slip?

80
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,391
No. No. What do you need?

81
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:03,559
An umpire.

82
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,019
Um, who do you think won
our treasure hunt bet?

83
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,980
It was a tie. Oh...

84
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:10,149
We need a rematch.
Oh, I have an idea.

85
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,942
Why don't we race each other
in an escape room?

86
00:03:11,943 --> 00:03:12,943
Hard pass.

87
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:14,069
No, we need a neutral party

88
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,590
to decide the terms
of the competition.

89
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,242
And that would be me. Okay.

90
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:23,162
I'm gonna assign each of you
a penal code violation

91
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:24,788
at random.

92
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,790
First one to make
their arrest wins.

93
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:31,211
Officer Chen,
your crime is 266i ‐‐

94
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,046
encourage, influence,
or persuade someone

95
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,715
to become a prostitute.

96
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:38,552
Sergeant Bradford,
yours is 148.4.

97
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:39,845
Oh, come on.

98
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,722
Willfully and maliciously
tampers with or breaks

99
00:03:41,723 --> 00:03:42,890
fire protection equipment?

100
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:44,475
You knew that
off the top of your head?

101
00:03:44,476 --> 00:03:46,101
You didn't?

102
00:03:46,102 --> 00:03:47,644
Hmm. It's unfair.

103
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,272
So is life. Deal with it.

104
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:51,399
Hmm.

105
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,444
Oh, thank you.

106
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,200
Is there any way
I can get a single?

107
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:02,618
No. I'm afraid not.

108
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:03,744
Maybe I can make a donation

109
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:05,162
to the policemen's fund
or something.

110
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:06,705
Okay, don't add bribery
to your charge.

111
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:07,915
It's a whole other
stack of paperwork.

112
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,124
Let's go.

113
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:11,084
What if I give you
someone worse?

114
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,378
I know about a real crime.

115
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,172
I could cut a deal, right?

116
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:16,298
Like in the movies.

117
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:19,009
That depends. What's the crime?

118
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,678
They're alleging you beat a man
to death with a tire iron.

119
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,972
Dude deserved it.
He's banging my ex‐wife.

120
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,933
That's a street violation.
That demands repercussions.

121
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:29,228
Right. Sadly, street violations
don't hold up in court.

122
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:30,771
Says here there's a witness.

123
00:04:30,772 --> 00:04:32,815
Yeah, some nosy old man
across the street

124
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:34,274
saw the whole thing.

125
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,984
Well, that's a problem. Why?

126
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,486
He's the one that's watching us
like some perv.

127
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:39,530
Be that as it may, we should
start talking plea deal.

128
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:40,823
A ‐‐ No!

129
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:42,199
No way, man, okay?

130
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,159
Elijah said you could fix this.

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,412
Elijah makes too many promises.

132
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,248
But I'll do what I can.

133
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:51,583
In the meantime, hey,
you know the drill ‐‐

134
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:52,835
best behavior.

135
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:54,295
Don't talk to anyone.

136
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:57,465
I noticed you got a new client.

137
00:04:58,466 --> 00:04:59,591
Yeah.

138
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:00,676
Business is good.

139
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:02,010
Lately, it seems like
all your clients

140
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,805
are on Elijah Stone's payroll.

141
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:08,767
Well, every criminal defendant
is entitled to a defense,

142
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,353
regardless of who
they associate with.

143
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:14,022
Yes, and up 'til recently,

144
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,942
you've always chosen
to represent the underdog.

145
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:18,861
But now, the way
things are going,

146
00:05:18,862 --> 00:05:20,696
you're on your way
to becoming a mob lawyer.

147
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:22,865
I think that's a bit extreme.

148
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:26,034
And there's only two ways
I've ever seen that turn out ‐‐

149
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:29,037
you end up disbarred
and indicted

150
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:30,622
or you end up dead.

151
00:05:30,623 --> 00:05:31,833
Okay, I think that ‐‐

152
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,795
You know how much I care
for Angela.

153
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:39,464
If you ever get in
over your head,

154
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:40,842
you can come see me.

155
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:45,762
I appreciate that.

156
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,180
But you know
I would never do anything

157
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:49,641
to jeopardize my family.

158
00:05:49,642 --> 00:05:51,269
I hope not.

159
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,818
I'll let you know if
there's gonna be a service.

160
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,404
Okay, bye.

161
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:04,489
I made breakfast.

162
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,490
You sure did.

163
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:07,409
I was feeling
a little powerless,

164
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,911
so this happened.

165
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:10,078
You're not gonna
hear me complaining.

166
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,331
This smells amazing.

167
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:13,373
Who was that on the phone?

168
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:14,708
Fred's old captain.

169
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:16,293
His family's dealing
with so much,

170
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:19,046
so I'm contacting some
of his former colleagues.

171
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,214
That's me.
I'll take this real quick.

172
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,215
Hey, what's up?

173
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,717
I just wanted to call
and check in

174
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,093
and see how Bailey's doing.

175
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,220
Uh, she's made four
different kinds of pancakes.

176
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,680
I'm not sure
if that's good or bad.

177
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:31,558
Yeah, the type A personality's
first stage of grief ‐‐ cooking.

178
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,560
What's next? Uh, cleaning.

179
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,228
Then organization.

180
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,396
She can't fix what happened,

181
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,940
but she can fix
every little thing

182
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:39,274
that's wrong in her apartment.

183
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:40,359
Uh, well, she's staying with me.

184
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,569
Yeah, well,
when she changes the drapes,

185
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,905
just roll with it. Right.

186
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:47,116
Thanks for checking in.
I gotta go.

187
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,911
I am so sorry, David,
but can you repeat that?

188
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:53,080
When were you at Lake Mead
with Fred?

189
00:06:53,081 --> 00:06:54,289
David: Last Fourth of July.

190
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,124
And you were with him
the whole time? Yep.

191
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,335
It was supposed to be
a week‐long camping trip,

192
00:06:58,336 --> 00:07:01,630
but, uh, a couple days in,
he got a nasty stomach bug.

193
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,424
He got so dehydrated,
I had to take him to Henderson.

194
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,259
He spent the rest of the trip
in the hospital.

195
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,553
Never thought that'd be
the last time I'd ever see him.

196
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:09,763
And he will be missed.

197
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,056
I will let you know
if there's any details

198
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,057
about the funeral.

199
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:13,517
Take care, okay? Thanks, Bailey.

200
00:07:13,518 --> 00:07:15,102
You too.

201
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:17,312
Okay, I know
I'm on pain pills and all,

202
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:18,939
but you heard
what I just heard, right?

203
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,733
We know Fred was in Nevada
July 8th,

204
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:25,195
and that lined up
with an unsolved arson‐homicide.

205
00:07:25,196 --> 00:07:26,780
But he was in the hospital.

206
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,156
Fred has an alibi.

207
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,866
That means Fred was set up,

208
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,952
and the real killer
is still out there somewhere.

209
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,161
What about the watch

210
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,871
and all the keepsakes
I found in his house?

211
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:37,999
Whoever framed Fred
must have planted them there,

212
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,042
counting on us finding them.

213
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:40,085
I gotta call Lopez,

214
00:07:40,086 --> 00:07:41,878
have her reopen
the investigation.

215
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,879
Don't just call.

216
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,423
You need to go into work.

217
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:45,299
Find that bastard.

218
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,508
Are you sure?

219
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:48,135
We have a deal, remember?

220
00:07:48,136 --> 00:07:49,469
I run toward fires.

221
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,762
You run toward bullets.

222
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,473
Time to run toward bullets.

223
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:56,309
But not literally.

224
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,687
Right.

225
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,444
So, I have a list of locations
we should check out

226
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:06,653
when we get back out on patrol.

227
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,864
You know, just some places
that I think need

228
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:10,115
a police presence.

229
00:08:10,116 --> 00:08:12,367
Places you're sure to get
your pandering collar?

230
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,995
Oh. Yeah. Maybe.

231
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,913
Is that really your focus?

232
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,374
Our bet? Come on.

233
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,709
I know that you bribed Nell

234
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,004
to throw any "fire alarm
tampering" cases your way.

235
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,839
Nell and I are friends. Mm.

236
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,425
Sometimes, I give her
Dodgers tickets.

237
00:08:31,095 --> 00:08:32,763
Oh, finally.

238
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:33,973
What's this all about?

239
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:36,808
Mrs. Carter, I understand
that you've recently started

240
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,101
your own skincare line.

241
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:39,269
Yes.

242
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,272
We're a small operation,
but we're growing.

243
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,107
I'm hoping to get
a write‐up in Goop.

244
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:45,984
I‐I don't know what that is.

245
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:47,069
I'll explain later.

246
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,111
Uh, a friend of yours

247
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,863
gave us a jar
of your night cream.

248
00:08:49,864 --> 00:08:51,323
She claims that
one of the ingredients

249
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:53,075
is tiger's blood ‐‐
like, literally,

250
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:54,910
blood from an endangered animal.

251
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:56,745
Firms the skin right up.

252
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:59,581
Participating in
the endangered animal trade

253
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,583
could land you in jail
for up to five years.

254
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:03,835
You don't understand
the wellness game.

255
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:05,128
It's cutthroat.

256
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:06,838
I need to stand out.

257
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,131
How else am I gonna compete

258
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:10,008
with Sloan
and her vitamin business?

259
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:13,678
I mean, everybody knows that
her B‐12 rejuvenation pills

260
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,933
are just benzos
in fancy bottles.

261
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,353
Um, she's selling
psychiatric drugs?

262
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:23,730
Oh, the whole "westside buffet."

263
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,316
What's Sloan's last name?

264
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,235
Hey, any news?

265
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:31,321
Valley Hospital in Henderson
verified that Fred was a patient

266
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,656
from July 6th to the 10th.

267
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:33,782
Okay, so there's no way

268
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:35,826
he committed the murder
and arson in Nevada.

269
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:37,786
No, we're gonna have to go back
and re‐examine everything

270
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:39,246
going back to the first
hit and run.

271
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:40,997
Whoever did this
is covering his tracks,

272
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:42,124
so we need to separate

273
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,875
the things our killer
wanted us to believe

274
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,210
from the facts of the case.

275
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,045
Hey, uh, Nolan.

276
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:49,131
Oh, uh, brought this for Bailey.

277
00:09:49,132 --> 00:09:50,632
Hope she's, uh,
f‐feeling better.

278
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:51,925
Oh, thank you, that's ‐‐
that's very thoughtful.

279
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:52,926
Yeah, she's doing great.

280
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,594
Oh, uh, I brought that, uh,

281
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,012
doorbell camera footage
you asked for.

282
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,222
Right, thank you very much
for that.

283
00:09:57,223 --> 00:09:58,348
This is Marcus.

284
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,766
He's, uh, Fred's neighbor.

285
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:00,809
I met him at the barbecue.

286
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,936
Uh, this is Detectives Lopez
and Harper.

287
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:04,104
Good to meet you.

288
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,480
I mean, bad circumstances.

289
00:10:05,481 --> 00:10:07,858
I ‐‐ I don't know
what I'm trying to say.

290
00:10:07,859 --> 00:10:09,568
Yeah, we're all struggling
with what happened.

291
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:10,819
Uh, what did happen?

292
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,155
Uh, people were saying
that it was a gas leak,

293
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:15,532
and one of the firefighters said
it could be arson.

294
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:17,492
And now I'm standing
in a police station.

295
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:19,161
I really don't know
what to think.

296
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:21,329
Uh, well, I'm afraid
there's not much I can tell you.

297
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,497
Of course. Right.

298
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,291
Did you notice anything
out of the ordinary

299
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,500
in the last few days?

300
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,920
Other than a big ball
of fire, no. Sorry.

301
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,755
Well, if you can think
of anything else,

302
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,132
you have Nolan's number.

303
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,884
Absolutely.

304
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:35,303
Thanks again. Yeah.

305
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:38,388
What'd he get her?

306
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,182
Uh... chocolates.

307
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:41,474
That's nice.

308
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,767
Look out.

309
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:43,810
What do you mean?

310
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,729
Nolan, he was the only civilian

311
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,272
at the firefighter party.

312
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:50,567
He is buying gifts for Bailey.

313
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:51,943
Come on. He's a badge bunny.

314
00:10:51,944 --> 00:10:53,361
Just for a different badge.

315
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,155
And your girlfriend's
wearing it.

316
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:56,531
Oh, no, I don't think so.

317
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:57,949
No, uh, he knows Bailey.

318
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:59,201
It's not so weird.

319
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:00,869
Okay, when was the last time
you bought chocolates

320
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,997
for someone you weren't
sleeping with?

321
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,458
Um...

322
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:11,838
That guy's after my girlfriend.
Mm. Yeah.

323
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,839
Fun.

324
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,132
Okay, I'm gonna start

325
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,926
combing through
the security footage.

326
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:17,010
What are you going to do?

327
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:18,261
Oh, I'm, uh,
headed to the hospital.

328
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:19,262
The victim you pulled
out of the fire

329
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,680
is finally out of ICU.

330
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,224
I'll go with you. All right.

331
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:23,225
Thank you. Mm‐hmm.

332
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:30,690
Elijah needs to see you.

333
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:32,692
Sure.

334
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,277
Just tell him to come upstairs.
We'll talk in my office.

335
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:35,445
Nah.

336
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:36,989
He wants to talk to you in his.

337
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:41,369
Counselor.

338
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:49,251
Just heard from Jay.

339
00:11:49,252 --> 00:11:52,212
He expressed
a lack of confidence

340
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:55,882
in your ability to get him out
of his legal difficulties.

341
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,592
He murdered a man.

342
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,761
Allegedly.

343
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:01,596
Except for the eyewitness
that clearly saw it happen.

344
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,556
Oh, come on, Counselor.

345
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,141
Eyewitness misidentification

346
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,520
is the leading cause
of wrongful conviction.

347
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:10,146
That's Defense Attorney 101.

348
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,523
What, I don't got enough
on my plate,

349
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,149
I gotta do your job, too?

350
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,943
Find some dirt on this guy.

351
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:16,945
Make him seem unreliable.

352
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:18,238
I'll do my best,
but so far, I ‐‐

353
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,992
Look, Jay got sloppy.

354
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:25,412
I know, and I'm pissed about it.

355
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:27,163
But he's my wife's
favorite cousin,

356
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,249
which means
he's my favorite cousin,

357
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,418
so prison's not an option.

358
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:35,088
Now, either you make
the witness go away,

359
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,590
or Moreno does.

360
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,636
As in "rest in peace"?

361
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:42,887
I didn't say that.

362
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,556
Unlike my wife's
dumb-ass cousin,

363
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:48,101
I'm not foolish enough
to commit or confess to crimes

364
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,394
in front of witnesses.

365
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:50,645
We don't even have to
go there, okay?

366
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:51,896
I can handle this.

367
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,274
I just need some time.
Get it done today.

368
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,317
Meeting's over.

369
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:57,320
Get out of my office
and go do your job.

370
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,540
Tim: Take off your sunglasses, ma'am.
Do I have to?

371
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,500
These fluorescent lights
give me vertigo.

372
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,377
Okay, that could be
the least of your worries.

373
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,838
We've been informed that
you're selling psychiatric drugs

374
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:17,839
as a vitamin.

375
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,132
Who said that?
It doesn't matter.

376
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,675
I'm helping people.

377
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:21,843
What's the problem?

378
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,636
You can't prescribe
a controlled substance

379
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:24,804
without a medical license.

380
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,348
My husband is a doctor.

381
00:13:26,349 --> 00:13:27,974
It's the family
prescription pad.

382
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,809
Yeah, that's not a thing.

383
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,353
Look, I don't think
you're hearing me, all right?

384
00:13:31,354 --> 00:13:32,687
This makes you a drug dealer.

385
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,898
And given the circumstances,
a pretty high level one.

386
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,733
You could be looking at
20 years in prison.

387
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:39,319
What? No. No, no, no, no, no.

388
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,530
This wh‐‐ This whole thing has
gotten horribly out of hand.

389
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,949
Who ratted me out, anyway?

390
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:46,910
It was Aston, wasn't it?

391
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:48,328
She's been trying
to take me down

392
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:49,996
ever since I stole
her portrait painter.

393
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:51,581
Like she needs to be
hung on a wall.

394
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:53,541
You want a real crime to chase?

395
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,461
Aston's trying to hire a hitman.

396
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,171
W‐What do you mean?

397
00:13:58,172 --> 00:14:00,090
Her husband's worth more
dead than alive,

398
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:01,591
so she's been on the dark web

399
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,427
trying to hire someone
to kill him.

400
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,399
Okay. Oh. That's your disguise?

401
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,526
You don't even look
like a hitman.

402
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,319
You just look like you.

403
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,071
This is what real hitmen
look like.

404
00:14:23,072 --> 00:14:24,739
That is not the point.

405
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,450
Come on. Get in.

406
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:30,829
What I'm wearing is fine. Okay.

407
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,831
Third rule of undercover work ‐‐

408
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:34,040
know your audience.

409
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,543
You are not trying to fool
another criminal.

410
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,962
You're trying to fool a woman
who gets her ideas about crime

411
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:40,588
from Lifetime movies.

412
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:41,756
Put it on.

413
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:42,882
Fine.

414
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:43,884
Thank you.

415
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,639
Oh, my gosh.

416
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,683
Yeah, that's much better.

417
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:53,351
I look like an idiot.

418
00:14:53,352 --> 00:14:54,602
I'd pull me over in a heartbeat.

419
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,438
Exactly ‐‐ because
you look the part.

420
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,901
Let's get this over with.

421
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:07,491
It's a little too high.

422
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:09,659
I know what I'm doing.

423
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,911
Ow.

424
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:13,329
Sorry.

425
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,248
Mic check, one, two.

426
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,291
Okay, levels are good.

427
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,169
She should be here
in 15 minutes.

428
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:36,811
What are you doing here?

429
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:38,271
I have until the end of the day.

430
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,814
I'm just here to get it done
if you can't.

431
00:15:39,815 --> 00:15:41,358
Good luck.

432
00:15:50,743 --> 00:15:53,537
Mr. Andrews, thank you for
meeting me on such short notice.

433
00:15:55,331 --> 00:15:57,333
Long as I ain't gotta
drive nowhere.

434
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,170
So, I just have a few questions

435
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:04,005
about the crime ‐‐ thank you ‐‐

436
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,715
that you allegedly witnessed.

437
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:08,176
Uh, first, do you wear glasses?

438
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,012
20/20 vision my whole life.

439
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,056
Great.

440
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:15,391
Anything to drink
on the night in question?

441
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,228
Been sober 38 years.

442
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:23,441
How clear was your view
of the events

443
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,776
the night in question?

444
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:27,654
He killed the man right there.

445
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:28,739
Huh?

446
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:34,911
It was getting late ‐‐
8:00 p. m.

447
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,705
It would've been dark.
Not on my block.

448
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:41,042
Those street lights so much
as flicker, I call the city.

449
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,336
You know why, Mr. Evers?

450
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:46,297
'Cause I do whatever it takes
to protect my neighborhood.

451
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,675
From criminals.

452
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,261
And their lawyers.

453
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:53,263
I know why you're here.

454
00:16:53,264 --> 00:16:55,431
Wanna scare me off.

455
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,309
Well, go tell your boss...

456
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,853
I don't scare easy.

457
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,147
I'm not trying
to intimidate you.

458
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,733
I just, um...

459
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,073
I hear you.

460
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,412
Can I use your bathroom
before I go?

461
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:18,622
Sure.

462
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,417
Thank you.

463
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,838
Operator: 911.
What's your emergency?

464
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,174
My neighbor keeps an illegal
firearm under his bed.

465
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:12,925
I'm in fear for my life.
Send the police.

466
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,428
70 Oak Place.

467
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,101
Ken: I don't remember his face.

468
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:25,188
I keep trying, but, uh,
every time I try and focus,

469
00:18:25,189 --> 00:18:28,149
uh, it just skitters away
from me like a silverfish.

470
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,110
Well, that's your mind
protecting you.

471
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,236
It's normal.

472
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,489
Yet I remember him
acting so horrified

473
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,949
that he hit me with his car.

474
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,120
He insisted on taking me
to the hospital, so...

475
00:18:41,497 --> 00:18:43,581
I let him put me
in the back seat.

476
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:45,249
Just went along with it.

477
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,834
A stranger said
he was gonna help me,

478
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,211
and I trusted him.

479
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:49,962
Of course you did.

480
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,965
Anyone else
would've done the same.

481
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,676
Did he say anything in the car?

482
00:18:54,677 --> 00:18:55,927
I‐I don't remember.

483
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:59,138
I‐I blacked out as soon
as I got into the car.

484
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,015
Well, they found Rohypnol
in your system.

485
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:02,850
That would explain the blackout.

486
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,394
Do you remember anything

487
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:06,646
from inside
the abandoned building

488
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:07,772
where he took you?

489
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:11,485
Unfortunately, um,
when I woke up...

490
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,821
pain was just eating me alive,

491
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:19,075
and, uh, I remember praying
that I would black out.

492
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:22,203
And then he started stomping
on my broken legs.

493
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,372
Is there anything else
you remember?

494
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,873
The smallest thing could help.

495
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,834
Uh, his back.

496
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,670
At one point, he leaned over,
and his shirt came up,

497
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,130
and there was something
on his back.

498
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:34,841
Was it a tattoo? Scar?

499
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:36,134
Uh, ma‐‐ Uh, maybe a burn?

500
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:37,927
I don't think it's a tattoo.

501
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,679
Maybe a burn or a scar.

502
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,180
Does that help?

503
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,348
Absolutely.

504
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,308
Um, call us

505
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:46,185
if you can think
of anything else,

506
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,730
and I will be sure to keep you
up to date on the case.

507
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:49,772
Okay?

508
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,066
Thank you. Yeah.

509
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,693
Hey, this guy is a predator.

510
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,405
He knew exactly
how to incapacitate you.

511
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,533
What happened
was not your fault.

512
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,835
You made sure you weren't followed?
Yes.

513
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,297
I drove around in circles
for like a half an hour.

514
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:19,218
So, how does this work?

515
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:21,012
Well, that's up to you.

516
00:20:21,013 --> 00:20:23,556
Your ad indicated you have
a problem with your husband?

517
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:24,640
Yes.

518
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,476
I need him to not be
alive anymore.

519
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:27,685
Mm, that's not gonna be enough.

520
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,562
We need her to spell it out.
Okay.

521
00:20:29,563 --> 00:20:31,355
Do you want it to look like
natural causes?

522
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,982
A suicide? Homicide?

523
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,276
Must be a lonely kind of life ‐‐

524
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,736
being a hitman.

525
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,362
It can be.

526
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,864
So, you're not seeing anyone?

527
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,949
Oh, my God.
She's hitting on you.

528
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,785
No, not at the moment.

529
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:44,952
Mm. You see, the thing is,

530
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,789
the fee varies
depending on the method.

531
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,666
So I need you to tell me
what you want.

532
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,668
Ooh.

533
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,589
What I want changed a little
when you got in the car.

534
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,508
Wait, is she touching you?
She's touching you, isn't she?

535
00:20:58,509 --> 00:20:59,509
Hey, you know what?

536
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,676
If she offers you money for sex,

537
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,136
I'm gonna win this bet.

538
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:06,474
Look, I am down to do
whatever you want. Hmm.

539
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,155
Yeah, you are. I just want to get
the business out of the way first.

540
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,563
So, it's $20,000
for a straight murder ‐‐

541
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:15,150
$25,000 if you want it
to look like suicide.

542
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,485
Sexy.

543
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:20,531
I'd pay you twice that
to kill the bastard.

544
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:23,825
And the bastard is?

545
00:21:23,826 --> 00:21:26,077
My husband, obviously.

546
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:27,203
Yes. Got her.

547
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,163
You know, once he's dead,

548
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:31,916
I'll be a very wealthy woman.

549
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:33,543
Hmm.

550
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:35,127
You're under arrest.

551
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,088
All right. No, I‐I appreciate
the help.

552
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,006
Thank you. Bye.

553
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,633
Hey. Anything?

554
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,552
We struck out
with Fred's gardener.

555
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,095
He has access
to Fred's property,

556
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:46,305
but he has an alibi
for almost every murder.

557
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,640
He's definitely not our guy.

558
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:50,184
And the mail carrier
alibied out, too.

559
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,686
So, that leaves us with...

560
00:21:51,687 --> 00:21:52,729
The handyman.

561
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,524
His name's Ricardo Fuentes,

562
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:58,568
and he has a couple of
assault charges from years ago.

563
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:00,903
Did you talk with him?
Yeah, and he was less than helpful.

564
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,281
When I asked for his whereabouts
on the dates of the murders,

565
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:04,740
he refused to answer.

566
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:05,950
That doesn't make him a suspect.

567
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,369
I mean, maybe he just
doesn't trust the police.

568
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,538
True, but when I asked him

569
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,456
why he went to Fred's house
yesterday morning,

570
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,125
he had an odd answer.

571
00:22:14,126 --> 00:22:15,918
He said he got a call
to go to Fred's house

572
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:17,378
to strap the water heater down

573
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,671
and that he was told
to enter the property

574
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:19,964
if no one was home.

575
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,132
And the odd part is?

576
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:22,466
How he claims he was paid.

577
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,677
With cash, in an envelope
taped to the water heater.

578
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:26,178
But of course,
he threw away the envelope.

579
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,722
So, maybe he's
telling the truth,

580
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:29,932
and this is him going
to strap down the water heater.

581
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,018
Or he's setting the bomb
that killed Fred.

582
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,686
Okay, well,
that's easily verifiable.

583
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,063
I can just swing by Fred's house
on the way home,

584
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,273
see if Ricardo did the work.

585
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:38,774
Thanks.
Let us know what you find.

586
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,152
You got it.

587
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:47,659
Hey, where's the food?

588
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,370
I forgot.

589
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:53,039
Sorry. It's been a crazy day.

590
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,749
Which is why I said
we should order in,

591
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,917
but you insisted

592
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,209
that you would be
driving by the restaurant

593
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,170
and would pick something up.

594
00:22:58,171 --> 00:22:59,295
Okay, I forgot.

595
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:01,589
Okay? Cut me some slack. Slack?

596
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,425
I work just as long as you
but somehow still came home,

597
00:23:04,426 --> 00:23:06,802
tidied up the house, fed Jack,
and put him to bed.

598
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,054
Well, that's because
you're perfect.

599
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:09,180
The rest of us are just human.

600
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,514
Wow. Where did that come from?

601
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,849
Where are you going?

602
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,936
To get the food.

603
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:30,368
Hey.

604
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:31,410
Bailey: When are you
coming home?

605
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,621
You okay? Yeah, I'm just tired.

606
00:23:33,622 --> 00:23:35,289
These painkillers are no joke.

607
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,499
Don't wait up for me.

608
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,167
Go to sleep. How's it going?

609
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,002
We're gonna catch this guy.
I promise.

610
00:23:40,003 --> 00:23:41,796
Oh, don't do that.

611
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,422
I don't need empty promises.

612
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,174
It's bad for relationships.

613
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:46,425
Trust me. Okay.

614
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,552
Well, we had a suspect,
but his story checks out,

615
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:50,096
and now we got nothing.

616
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,723
Well, there's three
varieties of pie

617
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,433
waiting for you
when you get home.

618
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,602
You are supposed to be
staying off your feet ‐‐

619
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:58,270
and what kind of pie?

620
00:23:58,271 --> 00:24:00,231
Cherry, apple,
and chocolate cream.

621
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:02,650
You're my favorite.
That's good, 'cause you're mine.

622
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,318
Hurry home to me, okay?

623
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:05,570
Yes, ma'am.

624
00:24:09,157 --> 00:24:11,158
Hey, Marcus. Marcus: Nolan.

625
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,910
Thanks again for that, uh,
doorbell footage.

626
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,870
It helped. Ah, good, good.

627
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,497
Um, any leads?

628
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,500
Uh, we're checking
all the angles.

629
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,136
Well...

630
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:31,387
have a good night.

631
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:32,556
You too.

632
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,613
Ugh!

633
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:28,069
Hey there.

634
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,196
You were out for quite a while.

635
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:32,948
You know, mixing Rohypnol
and head trauma

636
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,658
can be a little...

637
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:36,160
dicey.

638
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:38,412
Nolan: Where... are you?

639
00:25:38,413 --> 00:25:41,582
Only the coolest
place in Los Angeles.

640
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:42,833
I found this place
when I was out looking

641
00:25:42,834 --> 00:25:44,001
for a new killing ground.

642
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,336
It's some kind of used factory.

643
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,630
I don't know what the hell
they made here, but it is huge

644
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,548
and super abandoned,

645
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:52,677
and it got me thinking
on a much larger scale.

646
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,263
Hey, John?

647
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:57,474
John.

648
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,856
There you go.

649
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:07,650
Hey.

650
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:11,487
Do you know what
the adductor longus is, John?

651
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:12,613
Oh, probably not.

652
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:16,325
Uh, I'm pretty sure
yours is shredded.

653
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,744
You know, when car hits human,

654
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,329
human always loses.

655
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,747
But who am I to tell you that?

656
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,958
I mean, how many car wrecks

657
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:25,668
and hit‐and‐runs
have you worked?

658
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:26,961
They're gonna catch you.

659
00:26:26,962 --> 00:26:28,587
Maybe.

660
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,089
I mean, you ‐‐

661
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,091
you got uncomfortably close ‐‐

662
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:35,010
closer than anyone ever has.

663
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:36,387
It's all my fault.

664
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,972
No, I got lazy.

665
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:42,143
For 10 years, I have had
an ironclad MO ‐‐

666
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:43,769
travel to hunt.

667
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,939
But I‐I figured, you know,
Los Angeles, it's so big.

668
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,190
I‐I figured if I stayed

669
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,192
far enough away
from where I lived,

670
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:53,028
it'd be kind of like
a‐a murder staycation.

671
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:57,408
But then you got lucky
with that hot firefighter,

672
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:58,951
and I got unlucky.

673
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:03,330
So, it's time
to leave "Marcus" behind,

674
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:06,792
get off the grid, go on the run.

675
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,546
But, you know, first, I thought
I'd have a little fun.

676
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,383
Would you stop trying
to break free?

677
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:16,969
I'm gonna let you go
in a minute.

678
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,346
Bull. No, really.

679
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:21,599
See, the thing about addicts is,

680
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,851
they're constantly trying
to relive that first high ‐‐

681
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,269
you know, when the effect
was the strongest.

682
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,646
It's just ‐‐ It's never
as good the second time.

683
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,232
Is that why you target
former addicts?

684
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,277
Trying to punish
a version of yourself?

685
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,029
God, no!

686
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,865
I feel no shame for what I do.

687
00:27:37,866 --> 00:27:39,783
The needs I feel.

688
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:43,203
No, if I could
murder someone every day,

689
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,624
I would be the happiest man
on the planet.

690
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,542
Oh, I don't know ‐‐
maybe I'd lose my taste for it.

691
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:50,628
You know, like when you eat
too many chips.

692
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:52,504
Anybody ever tell you
you're crazy?

693
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:54,173
Sure.

694
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,842
But then I burn them to ash.

695
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:01,806
Ah.

696
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:10,064
Ooh, that was close.

697
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,107
Ooh, I should've
seen that coming.

698
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:15,736
Okay, not a great first step.

699
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,738
We'll call it a useful failing.

700
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,158
A teachable moment.

701
00:28:24,162 --> 00:28:25,829
Now...

702
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,123
here's the deal.

703
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,376
I'm gonna cut you free.

704
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,795
I'm gonna give you
a one‐minute head start,

705
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,713
and then I'm gonna
come kill you.

706
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:36,382
You gonna give me a weapon?

707
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,634
I said I wanted a challenge,

708
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:40,552
but I'm not an idiot.

709
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,554
And what if I don't run?

710
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:44,390
What if I come over there
and I take that knife

711
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:46,226
and I stick it some place
you don't like?

712
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:48,728
Aah!

713
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:56,902
Well, I think we're ready.

714
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,696
Huh?

715
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:00,781
This is exciting.

716
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,783
I'm ‐‐ I'm actually
a little bit nervous.

717
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,743
Are ‐‐ Are you?

718
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:07,956
Well, ready, set...

719
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,291
Oops.

720
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,129
I mean, you didn't think
I'd play fair, did you?

721
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:18,508
All right, well,
a‐one‐a‐Mississippi.

722
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:22,469
A‐two‐a‐Mississippi.

723
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,514
Tha‐ree‐a‐Mississippi.

724
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:53,186
Marcus: John?

725
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,735
Well...

726
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:04,905
This is fun, isn't it?

727
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,990
I gotta say, the silence?

728
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:08,408
It's kinda nice.

729
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:11,578
Usually, there's a lot
of whining and begging.

730
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,413
Fair amount of sobbing.

731
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:16,416
I mean, you'd think
that would be part of my thrill,

732
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,504
but, you know, it really
just works on the nerves.

733
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:02,421
Whoo‐hoo‐hoo‐hoo!

734
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,715
John.

735
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:09,136
See, the thing is,

736
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,804
the deck is stacked against you.

737
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:13,725
You see, I've had weeks
to get this place ready.

738
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:16,811
Hey, here we go.

739
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:29,731
What's wrong, John? You stuck?

740
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:38,666
Run, rabbit! Run!

741
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,462
Agh!

742
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:54,349
Whoo‐hoo‐hoo! John!

743
00:33:50,071 --> 00:33:51,572
Hey, John.

744
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,373
John, you in there?

745
00:34:01,374 --> 00:34:02,874
Hey, you wanna know
a little secret?

746
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:04,626
I hate scary movies.

747
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,336
I mean, you'd think
I'd love them 'cause ‐‐

748
00:34:06,337 --> 00:34:07,671
well, duh.

749
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:10,716
But no, I'm actually a sucker
for a jump‐scare.

750
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:14,095
You know, the way ‐‐ the way
you get everything real quiet.

751
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:18,890
And then it gets you
on the edge of your seat.

752
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:19,933
You know.

753
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:21,185
And then ‐‐ bam!

754
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,737
Ugh!

755
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:42,290
Ugh!

756
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,096
Argh.

757
00:34:59,724 --> 00:35:02,059
It's over, Marcus!

758
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,352
Give it up!

759
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:05,354
We can still call you
an ambulance!

760
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:06,772
You stabbed me.

761
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:08,899
What the heck
did you stab me with?

762
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,317
Scissors.

763
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:11,985
Rusty ones, too.

764
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:14,196
Now, you give your ass up.

765
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:16,657
You make this
a fight to the death,

766
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,367
I swear to God,

767
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:20,453
you'll be the one
they carry out of here!

768
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,666
Aw, come on.

769
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,752
Ah, safety, safety, safety.

770
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,614
Yes.

771
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:05,707
Agh!

772
00:36:10,294 --> 00:36:11,963
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

773
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:20,138
Aw!

774
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:34,234
Operator: 911.
What's your emergency?

775
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:37,821
This is Officer John Nolan,
badge number 25253.

776
00:36:37,822 --> 00:36:40,574
I am hurt and under attack
by Marcus Lindsey,

777
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:42,993
a serial murder suspect
armed with an assault rifle.

778
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:44,162
Send help!

779
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:21,199
I win.

780
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:23,785
And you're under arrest.

781
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:43,011
Ugh!

782
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:44,262
Moreno: Whoo.

783
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,639
You need to pay better attention

784
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,932
to your surroundings, man.

785
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:47,933
What do they call it?

786
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:49,100
Uh...

787
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:50,560
Situational awareness.

788
00:37:50,561 --> 00:37:52,562
Elijah's not gonna be
happy about this.

789
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,523
Elijah brought his own bat.

790
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:55,899
Wait, wait, wait!
Why are you doing this?!

791
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,193
Stop! Stop!

792
00:38:00,071 --> 00:38:01,905
The strangest thing
happened yesterday

793
00:38:01,906 --> 00:38:04,033
after you left
that witness' home.

794
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,744
Cops swooped in
and arrested him.

795
00:38:07,745 --> 00:38:09,704
It was almost like someone
wanted to keep him

796
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:11,832
out of harm's way.

797
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,626
It's like you were
working against me.

798
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,462
Are you really this stupid?

799
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,135
You told me
to make the witness go away.

800
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,764
That's what I did!
I took him off the board!

801
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,225
I got him arrested for
an illegal weapons violation.

802
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:32,102
There is no way
he can testify now.

803
00:38:32,103 --> 00:38:33,812
His credibility's shot.

804
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:34,896
And as an added bonus,

805
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:37,108
you didn't have
to commit another crime.

806
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,863
Oh.

807
00:38:42,864 --> 00:38:44,615
Well, that changes things.

808
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:53,290
You need to work on
your communication skills,

809
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:56,586
'cause this beating's based
on your lack of transparency.

810
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:03,925
Are we good?

811
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:05,719
Yeah.

812
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,762
For now.

813
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:09,724
Great work.

814
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:22,569
Hey.

815
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,571
Hey.

816
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:27,616
Welcome back to the land
of the living.

817
00:39:27,617 --> 00:39:29,159
Doc said you were
pretty banged up,

818
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,661
but lucky you ‐‐
no broken bones.

819
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:33,121
Really?

820
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:34,706
It feels like
everything's broken.

821
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:36,459
They have meds for that.

822
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:39,836
Great job out there.

823
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,004
We got him.

824
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,130
No, you got him.

825
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:44,717
Yeah, after he got me.

826
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:49,429
There she is.

827
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,890
Hi.

828
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,270
Come here.

829
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,897
Ow. Oh, sorry.

830
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:00,106
No, no. It's okay, it's okay.

831
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:01,816
It's a good hurt. I can take it.

832
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,068
I can take it.

833
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:04,277
I can't take it.

834
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:06,446
Mm.

835
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,782
I'm so relieved you're okay.

836
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:09,908
Oh, it's nothing.

837
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,368
Just a couple more war wounds

838
00:40:11,369 --> 00:40:13,286
I can flaunt in bed.

839
00:40:13,287 --> 00:40:14,955
Speaking of,
what are you doing here?

840
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:16,247
Aren't you supposed
to be in bed?

841
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:18,416
Mm, yeah.

842
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:19,668
Scoot over.

843
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:21,252
Done.

844
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,047
Okay.

845
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:25,925
Okay.

846
00:40:33,224 --> 00:40:35,100
You got him.

847
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:36,559
I told you I would.

848
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,103
Oh, no.

849
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:40,105
"I told you so" is so much worse

850
00:40:40,106 --> 00:40:41,189
than "I promise."

851
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,566
Really? A relationship killer.

852
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,235
100%.

853
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:47,613
I'm gonna need some kind
of cheat sheet, I think.

854
00:40:52,076 --> 00:40:53,118
Seriously, I can't believe

855
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,619
you bought out
the entire gift shop.

856
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,496
What? You've been
in the hospital before.

857
00:40:56,497 --> 00:40:58,331
You know how boring it can be.

858
00:40:58,332 --> 00:41:00,375
What did you get him? Nothing.

859
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:02,460
I'll just put my name on yours.

860
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,962
Unbelievable.

861
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:05,130
Hey, we're going
back out on patrol

862
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:07,007
after we're done visiting
with Nolan, right?

863
00:41:07,008 --> 00:41:08,133
Lucy.

864
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:09,968
Mm‐hmm. What?

865
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:11,386
You know, I have a bet to win.

866
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:12,637
Okay, can we just call it off?

867
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,514
Police work is too important
to turn into a game.

868
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:16,307
You're just worried
you're gonna lose.

869
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:18,393
Sure. If that's what you need to
hear, let's go with that.

870
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:19,644
Wait, hold on.

871
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:22,689
Since when did you become
the noble one here?

872
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,025
Does this mean
we're square on our bet?

873
00:41:25,026 --> 00:41:26,109
Fine.

874
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,318
Nobody wins.

875
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,488
But the basket is only from me.

876
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:37,203
Where you been?

877
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,123
I thought you were gonna
be here for bedtime.

878
00:41:41,625 --> 00:41:43,669
Sorry, I‐I got stuck on a call.

879
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,264
Angela.

880
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:06,691
What's wrong?

881
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:08,360
I screwed up.

882
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:11,322
I need help.
