1
00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:08,066
I don't think new posters
are gonna cut it.

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,265
What?

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,224
You're gonna need to
up your campaign game.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,445
Well, perhaps my campaign
manager has some ideas.

5
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:17,273
You mean besides
all the e-mails I sent you?

6
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:19,841
I should probably read those.

7
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:22,148
Nolan, Lopez needs a unit

8
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:23,560
to accompany her this morning,
and that's you.

9
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:24,150
Yes, sir. My pleasure.

10
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:25,673
Uh, sir...

11
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:28,023
Can I count on your vote?

12
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:30,156
I'm still doing my due diligence
with the candidates.

13
00:00:31,505 --> 00:00:32,854
It's Smitty!

14
00:00:32,898 --> 00:00:33,855
You got my vote.

15
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,552
Thank you. Not mine.

16
00:00:35,596 --> 00:00:36,771
I'm not in the union yet.

17
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:38,468
Right.

18
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:46,637
Looks like we're gonna be
riding together.

19
00:00:48,217 --> 00:00:50,002
Everything good? Uh, yeah.

20
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:52,110
We have to interview one of
these Sovereign Citizen idiots.

21
00:00:52,134 --> 00:00:54,006
He allegedly assaulted
an IRS agent

22
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:56,747
who had a few questions
about why Marvin Reynolds

23
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,358
wasn't paying any of his taxes.

24
00:00:58,401 --> 00:00:59,770
Angela, I thought we were gonna
talk more this morning.

25
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:00,969
I woke up, you were gone.

26
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:02,120
Yeah, I have a job, remember?

27
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:03,450
Uh...

28
00:01:03,493 --> 00:01:04,364
I'll wait for you by the shop.

29
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:06,279
I'm right behind you.

30
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:07,541
Angela.

31
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:10,389
I don't have time
for this conversation right now.

32
00:01:10,413 --> 00:01:12,676
How many times can I apologize?

33
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,766
I told you,
I didn't have a choice.

34
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,464
Look, making a deal with Elijah

35
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:19,355
was the only way that I could
get you home safe.

36
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,424
I understand why you did
what you did.

37
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:23,426
I can even understand
why you kept it from me...

38
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,013
You don't want to stress out
the new mom.

39
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:26,995
But to tell me
I need to stay out of it

40
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,344
after asking for my help...

41
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,955
Look, I didn't mean for you...

42
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:33,219
I got myself into this.

43
00:01:33,262 --> 00:01:35,003
No, you got us into this,

44
00:01:35,047 --> 00:01:36,222
and I'm going to get usout.

45
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:37,788
Well, how do you plan
to do that?

46
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:39,766
By telling Elijah Stone you
don't work for him anymore.

47
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,116
And if he's got
a problem with that,

48
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,378
me and a couple hundred
of my closest friends...

49
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:44,186
No, you can't.

50
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,014
He has leverage on me.

51
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:48,495
He could take it
to the state bar.

52
00:01:48,538 --> 00:01:49,887
I could lose my license.

53
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:52,368
Last night, you swore
you didn't break any laws.

54
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:53,412
I haven't.

55
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:56,851
There could be
some ethical questions.

56
00:01:58,244 --> 00:01:59,897
I can't do this right now.

57
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,030
We'll talk tonight.

58
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:06,774
He can't really believe

59
00:02:06,817 --> 00:02:08,428
he can buy votes
with water bottles.

60
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:10,125
I mean, not when I have
a real message,

61
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,300
a message of change.

62
00:02:11,344 --> 00:02:12,823
Actually, he's beating you.

63
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,086
I did some polling,

64
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:16,001
and you are definitely behind.

65
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:17,611
I'm losing to Smitty?

66
00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:18,829
Oh, that's embarrassing.

67
00:02:18,873 --> 00:02:20,396
You know what would really help?

68
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,800
An endorsement from someone
respected within the department.

69
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:26,446
No, don't drag me into this.

70
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:28,709
No, I have never endorsed
a candidate, and I never will.

71
00:02:28,752 --> 00:02:29,971
Voting is a private matter.

72
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:34,497
Here, maybe this will help
wash away the taste of defeat.

73
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:35,846
This bottle's been opened.

74
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,979
Oh, those bottles
are recyclable.

75
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:39,696
It's just my way of giving back
to the environment.

76
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,982
Where's the water from?

77
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:42,114
My bathroom sink.

78
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:44,681
Water's water.

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
sync & corrections
  jhj@2021

80
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:57,172
Everything okay
with you and Wesley?

81
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:58,173
No.

82
00:02:58,217 --> 00:02:59,653
I get it.

83
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:01,916
Sarah wanted to divorce me
at least three times

84
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:03,526
during Henry's first year.

85
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,441
It felt like I couldn't
get anything right.

86
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,008
It's rough, those early days.

87
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:09,924
You know, it's a lack of sleep,
it's fear of the unknown,

88
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:11,206
a baby that won't stop crying...

89
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,883
It's not about that.

90
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:15,277
What is it about?

91
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,342
Right now, it's about you
not minding your own business.

92
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:19,499
Put the shop in drive
and let's go.

93
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:20,822
I will have to put it in reverse

94
00:03:20,848 --> 00:03:22,545
before I can actually put it...

95
00:03:22,589 --> 00:03:24,460
I know that look. No more jokes.

96
00:03:31,163 --> 00:03:31,859
Tim: Genny.

97
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:33,469
Sergeant Bradford.

98
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:36,777
You look skinny.

99
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,778
Have you been eating?

100
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:39,519
Every day. Uh-huh.

101
00:03:39,562 --> 00:03:41,279
This is a restricted area.
How'd you get in here?

102
00:03:41,303 --> 00:03:43,479
Oh, the guy who's
handing out waters let me in.

103
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,003
Okay. Yeah. Don't drink that.

104
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:47,875
Um...

105
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:48,982
So, what are you doing here?

106
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:51,096
I just wanted to
see my big brother.

107
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:53,707
Oh, hi. I'm Lucy Chen.

108
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,838
I know that we just met,

109
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:55,989
but if you have
any embarrassing stories

110
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:57,798
from his childhood, that...

111
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:02,411
So you just wanted to see me?

112
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:04,152
I didn't even know
you were in town.

113
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:05,782
So you're not just not
returning my calls,

114
00:04:05,806 --> 00:04:06,763
you're also ignoring
the messages

115
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:07,871
telling you I'm coming to town.

116
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:09,133
Because I know why you're here,

117
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:10,724
and I've made
my position very clear.

118
00:04:12,682 --> 00:04:15,163
We have to talk about it.

119
00:04:15,207 --> 00:04:16,251
Look, I gotta get to work.

120
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:18,210
Maybe we can
have dinner tonight.

121
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:20,168
So you can
blow me off at the last minute?

122
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:22,562
No.

123
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:25,826
Why don't I do one of those
ride-along thingies?

124
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:27,456
That way, we could have
the whole day to catch up.

125
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,177
Yeah.

126
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:30,589
See, you gotta get permission
to do a ride-along.

127
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:32,006
It's...

128
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:33,288
It's a long process,
a ton of paperwork.

129
00:04:33,312 --> 00:04:34,269
Hey, you're a sergeant now.

130
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:35,792
You can just
approve it yourself.

131
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,229
Great.

132
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:39,187
Let's hit the streets.

133
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:40,231
Let's.

134
00:04:42,495 --> 00:04:43,974
Did Tim have any, um,

135
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,138
nicknames when he was a kid?

136
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:54,898
So, it's been six weeks.

137
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:57,162
Any thoughts on my progress?

138
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:58,989
I write an evaluation every day.

139
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:02,079
Those are my thoughts
on your progress.

140
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:03,753
Right, I mean,
that's the technical stuff,

141
00:05:03,777 --> 00:05:05,170
but I was just wondering, like,

142
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:06,823
what you thought of me
as a person.

143
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,740
What matters is what
I think about you as a cop.

144
00:05:10,784 --> 00:05:14,179
You want people to like you,
go make some friends.

145
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:20,141
Harper.

146
00:05:22,012 --> 00:05:24,058
What?

147
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,277
Oh, no, no.

148
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,920
This is the first
I'm hearing about this.

149
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,455
He can't do that, though, right?

150
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:33,720
Maybe? W-What do you mean maybe?

151
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:34,938
You... You are the lawyer.

152
00:05:34,982 --> 00:05:37,027
Shouldn't you know that
for sure?

153
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,551
Okay, well, I-I'ma need you

154
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:40,379
to get some damn clarity
and call me back.

155
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:44,426
Is everything okay? No.

156
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:49,257
My ex-husband
is getting married,

157
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,128
and he wants to move
to San Francisco

158
00:05:51,172 --> 00:05:52,652
and take my daughter with him.

159
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,176
Can he do that?

160
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,265
I don't know.

161
00:05:57,309 --> 00:06:00,747
This is Detective Angela Lopez,
badge number 1777.

162
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,793
I need complete histories,
statewide and CJIC,

163
00:06:03,837 --> 00:06:05,273
for the personal file numbers...

164
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:10,800
NWC-057, JPA-733, BXR-389.

165
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:13,063
And if any of those queries
generate other file numbers,

166
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:14,302
can I get completes
on those, too?

167
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:15,979
Thanks.

168
00:06:17,329 --> 00:06:18,852
What was that about?

169
00:06:18,895 --> 00:06:20,680
Uh, another case I'm working on.

170
00:06:20,723 --> 00:06:22,377
Anything I can help with?

171
00:06:22,421 --> 00:06:24,597
No, I got it handled.

172
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,097
Genny: Oh, yeah, he tried to
highlight his hair right before prom.

173
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:28,905
He ended up
looking like Slim Shady.

174
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,298
Hm! Oh, you know what?

175
00:06:30,342 --> 00:06:31,580
I think I have a picture of it.

176
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:34,259
Oh, my God, yes! Genny.

177
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:36,237
What, you'd... you'd rather
I keep this photo private?

178
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:39,612
That's fine.
Let's talk about dad.

179
00:06:39,655 --> 00:06:41,135
I have nothing to say.

180
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:42,832
Okay.

181
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:44,157
What's your cellphone number?
I'll text it to you.

182
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:46,793
Genny, come on. We don't
need your distractions.

183
00:06:46,836 --> 00:06:48,229
Police work is serious stuff.

184
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:53,582
Ooh, boy.

185
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,771
Tim: Hey, ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to pull over.

186
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:10,556
You'll never catch me!

187
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,427
Have you been drinking?

188
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,604
It's not illegal
to drink and bike.

189
00:07:15,648 --> 00:07:17,084
Actually, it is.

190
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:18,888
The way you were swerving
in and out of traffic...

191
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:20,914
Oh. Uh...

192
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:22,742
You could have caused
an accident. Alright?

193
00:07:22,785 --> 00:07:25,440
I just wanna get some tacos!

194
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:28,225
Don't be such a butt.

195
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:30,358
Okay, ma'am, we can cite you
for public intoxication,

196
00:07:30,402 --> 00:07:33,230
or if you don't cooperate,
we'll charge you with a DUI.

197
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:38,540
Screw you, you
Ken-doll-ass-looking mimbo...

198
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,846
Hey, honey.

199
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:41,258
Honey, I know
you're having a bad day,

200
00:07:41,282 --> 00:07:42,433
but that doesn't give you
the right to be rude.

201
00:07:42,457 --> 00:07:44,503
They're just doing their jobs.

202
00:07:44,546 --> 00:07:46,026
Why don't you take
a few deep breaths

203
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:47,109
and sit down for a minute?

204
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:52,162
I'm sorry.

205
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,645
That was impressive.

206
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:58,081
I teach fourth graders.

207
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:03,478
Oh, great.

208
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:06,960
Okay, look, you cannot move
our daughter to San Francisco.

209
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:08,198
What... What...
What are we gonna do?

210
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,311
Put her on a plane
every weekend?

211
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:11,375
Enroll her in two schools?

212
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,879
No, obviously not.

213
00:08:12,922 --> 00:08:15,055
What you are asking for
is near total custody

214
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:17,405
and I see her on weekends
and holidays, which...

215
00:08:17,449 --> 00:08:20,974
Which is a violation of our
custody agreement, by the way,

216
00:08:21,017 --> 00:08:23,280
so I... I'm gonna need...

217
00:08:23,324 --> 00:08:25,128
Voicemail: If you're satisfied
with your message, press one.

218
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:26,675
If you'd like to
re-record, pre...

219
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:31,201
Look, I know he's
your daughter's father,

220
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:33,465
but that man is a coward
for springing this on you.

221
00:08:35,728 --> 00:08:39,688
Well, he might have
left a message last week

222
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:42,430
saying that he needed to talk
to me about something, but...

223
00:08:42,474 --> 00:08:44,911
Maybe it was two messages.

224
00:08:44,954 --> 00:08:48,088
There might have been
an e-mail. But...

225
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:49,500
Okay. Then, why didn't you
call him back?

226
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:51,657
I don't know. I thought
it was about something else.

227
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,049
Oh, so you were avoiding him?

228
00:08:53,093 --> 00:08:55,008
No, I was n...

229
00:08:55,051 --> 00:08:56,923
I don't know. Maybe.

230
00:08:56,966 --> 00:09:00,317
I did... I didn't want to
have to talk about...

231
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,493
Halloween.

232
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:03,843
What happened on Halloween?

233
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,586
Ohhh. Mm.

234
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:10,284
Lopez: Sorry.

235
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:12,175
Well, we're about to land
at Marvin Reynolds' place.

236
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:13,461
What are we hoping for?

237
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,376
Ideally, he admits to
assaulting the IRS agent

238
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,464
and we hook him up.

239
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:17,987
Otherwise, it's just
a misdemeanor

240
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:20,337
not committed
in police presence.

241
00:09:20,381 --> 00:09:23,079
His word against
the IRS agent's.

242
00:09:23,123 --> 00:09:24,883
Yeah, I always mix up these
Sovereign Citizen guys

243
00:09:24,907 --> 00:09:27,475
with the Posse Comitatus group.

244
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,824
They're all just part of

245
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:31,479
the same crazy,
anti-government soup...

246
00:09:31,523 --> 00:09:34,395
All just looking for their way
not to pay their fair share.

247
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,155
I think there's a little
more to it than that.

248
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:37,833
Good for you.

249
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,531
Look, there's always
people in society

250
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:41,707
who feel like
they're on the outside.

251
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,970
And some are easily manipulated.

252
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:46,407
Some are so desperate
to find a purpose

253
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,365
that they allow themselves
to be infected

254
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:50,063
by the most absurd beliefs,

255
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:51,673
so much so,
they could rationalize

256
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,370
beating up an IRS agent...

257
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:54,763
Or worse.

258
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:56,983
Nah. My theory's better.

259
00:09:57,026 --> 00:09:59,376
These whack jobs just believe
they're above the law,

260
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,465
until they need it.

261
00:10:02,597 --> 00:10:03,816
There it is.

262
00:10:16,263 --> 00:10:17,588
This guy have
a history of violence?

263
00:10:17,612 --> 00:10:19,875
Why do you think
I'm putting on a vest?

264
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,791
Let me guess. Domestic abuse?

265
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:24,837
Among other things,
but he never did any time.

266
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:34,411
Hey, get the hell off
of my property!

267
00:10:34,455 --> 00:10:37,197
Sir, I'm Detective Lopez,
and this is Officer Nolan.

268
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,503
Are you Marvin Reynolds?

269
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:40,346
You know what?
That name is a straw-man, okay?

270
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,507
I'm a free man,
I'm living upon the land.

271
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,354
You're representatives of
a corporate government.

272
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:45,945
You have no authority over me.

273
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:49,035
I am not a citizen of
your corporation!

274
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:50,950
Sir, a complaint's been
filed against you

275
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:53,300
claiming you assaulted
a federal employee from the IRS.

276
00:10:53,343 --> 00:10:54,582
Yeah, they're trying to
take my house.

277
00:10:54,606 --> 00:10:55,955
Okay?

278
00:10:55,998 --> 00:10:57,696
But, see, there's no
legitimate money,

279
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:00,133
because we went off
the gold standard in 1933.

280
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:01,961
So you're admitting
to the assault?

281
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:05,399
No, I admit nothing, okay?

282
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:06,985
And I don't... I don't...
I don't have any obligation

283
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:09,185
to submit
to your unlawful inquiry.

284
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:10,815
Sir, we need to talk to you
about what happened.

285
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:12,406
Can you please step out
onto the porch?

286
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:14,887
I'm a constitutional activist,
okay?

287
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,671
I know my rights.

288
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:19,456
A-A-And what you're
practicing here, it's tyranny.

289
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,850
Sir, we just want
your side of the story.

290
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:23,896
I promise you, this will be
much more productive

291
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:25,419
if you just step out
onto the porch.

292
00:11:25,462 --> 00:11:27,116
Ah.

293
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,076
Yeah, that's...
That's not gonna happen.

294
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:31,120
Okay?

295
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:34,559
So get off of my property. Now.

296
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,563
Sir, take it easy.

297
00:11:38,606 --> 00:11:40,173
Don't do anything stupid.

298
00:11:42,871 --> 00:11:44,743
Sir?

299
00:11:44,786 --> 00:11:46,266
Lopez: Gun! Move, move, move!

300
00:11:49,661 --> 00:11:51,097
7-Adam-15.

301
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,969
Shots fired at our location.
Send backup, Code 3.

302
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,450
You ready? Yeah.

303
00:11:57,973 --> 00:11:59,409
He's going outside.
He's running.

304
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:19,821
No!

305
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:26,219
Control, 7-Adam-15.
Code 3 traffic.

306
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:28,656
We just got 246'd
by a submachine gun.

307
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,702
Suspect vehicle... silver sedan,

308
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:32,355
last seen headed west
on Oakwood.

309
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,487
Suspect still armed.

310
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,398
Air Three is lifting now.

311
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:40,618
I'm ten-nine-seven.
Searching for suspect's vehicle.

312
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:44,927
Control, 7-Adam-100 on scene.

313
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:50,367
Stay in the car.

314
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,847
Anybody hurt?

315
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,607
We're good, but we've got
one shooter outstanding...

316
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,980
Marvin Reynolds.

317
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,460
Suspect vehicle... silver sedan.

318
00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:58,307
Did not get very good I.D.
I didn't get any plates.

319
00:12:58,331 --> 00:12:59,526
Alright, let's pull DMV records,

320
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,030
see what Marvin's
got registered.

321
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,051
Got to find everything
we can about this guy. On it.

322
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:04,381
I'll ask for
a telephonic warrant

323
00:13:04,424 --> 00:13:05,837
to search the GPS of
his vehicle on his phone.

324
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:07,123
If we can see where he's been,

325
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,317
it might help us know
where he's going.

326
00:13:08,341 --> 00:13:10,126
Control, 7-Adam-100,
advise crime scene

327
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:11,799
they can begin processing
and start a board-up crew.

328
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:14,347
And I need all available units
for a city-wide manhunt.

329
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:17,133
Tim: Alright, listen up...
At approximately 1057 hours,

330
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:18,830
suspect Marvin Reynolds
opened fire

331
00:13:18,874 --> 00:13:20,155
on Officer Nolan
and Detective Lopez

332
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,311
with a submachine gun.

333
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:22,679
We're dealing with
a Sovereign Citizen

334
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:24,140
who's clearly snapped.

335
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,118
He assaulted an IRS agent
who showed up two days ago

336
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:27,752
to start foreclosure
proceedings.

337
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:29,362
We're gonna hit up
every known address,

338
00:13:29,406 --> 00:13:31,495
every relative's address,
every associate,

339
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:33,149
every friend of a friend
of a friend

340
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:34,977
until someone
coughs this guy up.

341
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,477
Okay, he hasn't renewed any of his
registrations in over four years,

342
00:13:37,501 --> 00:13:39,696
but I got a list of everything
he's owned going back to 2005.

343
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,548
You got a silver Honda
on there or a Toyota?

344
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:43,439
There's a silver Civic,
as well as three other vehicles.

345
00:13:43,463 --> 00:13:44,527
Alright, send that list
to everyone's boxes.

346
00:13:44,551 --> 00:13:45,509
Make sure you keep checking.

347
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:47,467
This is a very fluid situation.

348
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:49,358
Now let's go get this guy
before he does something worse.

349
00:13:49,382 --> 00:13:51,297
Phew.

350
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:52,908
What's going on?

351
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:53,972
I'm taking you back to the station.
It's too dangerous.

352
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:55,388
Forget it.Genny.

353
00:13:55,432 --> 00:13:57,608
I'm not leaving until
we talk about dad.

354
00:13:57,651 --> 00:13:58,870
Oh, you are impossible.

355
00:13:58,914 --> 00:14:00,741
I'mimpossible?

356
00:14:00,785 --> 00:14:02,352
Lucy, who's more difficult,
me or Tim?

357
00:14:02,395 --> 00:14:04,223
Of course she's gonna pick me!

358
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:05,722
Because you are the most
stubborn person alive,

359
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:07,289
which is, by the way,
why you're still single.

360
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,011
Okay. First of all, I'm not.

361
00:14:09,054 --> 00:14:10,403
And second... Wait. What?

362
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:12,579
You're seeing someone? This is insane.

363
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:14,543
There is an armed and dangerous
suspect at large.

364
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:16,496
We gotta focus.

365
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,852
Are you okay?

366
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,593
I'm fine.
I've been shot at before.

367
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:28,204
That's not what
I'm talking about.

368
00:14:28,247 --> 00:14:29,683
Something else is going on here,

369
00:14:29,727 --> 00:14:32,034
and maybe a friendly ear
will help.

370
00:14:35,037 --> 00:14:36,864
Wesley made a deal
with Elijah Stone

371
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:39,389
to find out where La Fiera
was keeping me in Guatemala,

372
00:14:39,432 --> 00:14:41,913
and now Elijah is
threatening our family.

373
00:14:44,785 --> 00:14:47,266
What do we do?

374
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,355
Thank you, but I'm trying to
figure that out.

375
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,966
Well, it doesn't seem
that complicated.

376
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:53,490
He's a criminal,
and you're a cop.

377
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:56,797
There's an element I can't talk
about, but it muddies things.

378
00:14:56,841 --> 00:15:00,584
Well, for what it's worth,

379
00:15:00,627 --> 00:15:03,456
I have never met a couple
so different from each other

380
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,719
and yet so perfect
for one another.

381
00:15:05,763 --> 00:15:07,678
I can't imagine what it is
you're facing,

382
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:09,680
but I do know this...

383
00:15:09,723 --> 00:15:12,291
The only way you're gonna
get through it is together.

384
00:15:16,426 --> 00:15:17,949
Pull over.

385
00:15:17,993 --> 00:15:19,211
You gonna throw up?

386
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:20,362
Was that a little
too saccharine?

387
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,084
A little,
but I need to make a call.

388
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:24,173
I've been known to
keep a secret.

389
00:15:24,216 --> 00:15:25,478
I need to make a call,

390
00:15:25,522 --> 00:15:27,021
and unless you want to
be subpoenaed one day,

391
00:15:27,045 --> 00:15:28,742
you can't hear any of it,
so pull over.

392
00:15:28,786 --> 00:15:30,527
Roger that.

393
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:44,715
Hey, it's me.

394
00:15:44,758 --> 00:15:45,803
Hey. Are we okay?

395
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:46,760
I'm working on it.

396
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:48,066
I've been digging

397
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,894
into everything I can find
about Elijah,

398
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:51,113
and I think I have a plan.

399
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:53,245
We're going to build
a RICO case against him

400
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:55,378
and make sure he rots in jail,

401
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:58,163
which means I need you to
document every interaction

402
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,314
you've ever had with Elijah...

403
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:01,384
Every threat or implied threat,

404
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,081
admission to his own crimes

405
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,493
or the crimes of
his criminal enterprise.

406
00:16:04,517 --> 00:16:06,171
No, I can't.

407
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,043
That violates
attorney-client privilege.

408
00:16:08,086 --> 00:16:09,827
Are you serious? I know.

409
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,959
He threatened
your wife and baby.

410
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:13,787
The privilege belongs
to the client.

411
00:16:13,831 --> 00:16:15,093
It's not my privilege to waive.

412
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:16,616
You made a vow.

413
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,878
What's more important,

414
00:16:17,922 --> 00:16:19,750
your vow to your client
or to me?

415
00:16:23,145 --> 00:16:25,060
Oh, up on the right...
Silver one.

416
00:16:25,103 --> 00:16:28,193
No, wrong make and model.

417
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,282
Any other plans
while you're in L.A.?

418
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:32,937
I have to sell our dad's house.

419
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,610
He hasn't been able to live
on his own for awhile.

420
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:36,419
Oh. I'm sorry.

421
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,899
Thanks. It's a mess.

422
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:40,181
It's a lot of work
for one person.

423
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:41,772
Well, I'm sure Tim will help.

424
00:16:41,815 --> 00:16:43,135
What's the point?
It's a teardown.

425
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:45,123
Just sell it
and be done with it.

426
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,603
It's got good bones.

427
00:16:46,646 --> 00:16:48,407
We could make some money
if we put in a little effort.

428
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:50,911
You watch a couple hours of HGTV
and now you're an expert?

429
00:16:50,955 --> 00:16:52,522
Wait, what is
your favorite show?

430
00:16:52,565 --> 00:16:54,045
Mine is "House Hunters
International."

431
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,960
Oh, my God. The best.

432
00:16:56,003 --> 00:16:57,744
Nolan, can you 10-3
to another channel?

433
00:16:57,788 --> 00:16:59,833
Roger that. Going to 6.

434
00:16:59,877 --> 00:17:02,184
Yeah, look, my sister needs
to sell my dad's house,

435
00:17:02,227 --> 00:17:03,335
but it hasn't been
updated or repaired

436
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:05,012
since it was built in 1958.

437
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,536
What are the inspections
gonna reveal?

438
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,538
Uh, 1958?

439
00:17:08,581 --> 00:17:10,801
It's probably got old
cloth-insulated wiring

440
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:12,237
that would need to be replaced.

441
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,283
Uh, the plumbing would
need to be updated.

442
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,285
The cast-iron sewer
could be cracked

443
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,634
or rusted through in places,

444
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:19,394
and the foundations
would need to be checked.

445
00:17:19,418 --> 00:17:20,811
So it's a teardown.

446
00:17:20,854 --> 00:17:21,986
Oh, no, not necessarily.

447
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:23,205
If it has good bones,

448
00:17:23,248 --> 00:17:24,510
some simple repairs and updates

449
00:17:24,554 --> 00:17:26,904
would double the value
of your house.

450
00:17:26,947 --> 00:17:27,968
I'm happy to swing by,
take a look at it,

451
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:29,298
see what needs to be done.

452
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:31,430
Alright, you will all
have to wait your turn.

453
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:35,608
Nolan is busy helping me install
my new kitchen backsplash.

454
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:37,132
Right, but after that.

455
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:38,535
Kind of regretting
telling everyone

456
00:17:38,568 --> 00:17:40,178
you used to be a contractor,
aren't you?

457
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:41,875
Aaron: Hey, Nolan,
do you do pergolas?

458
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,182
'Cause my outdoor space
is really underused.

459
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:46,228
Landscaping's not really
my area of expertise,

460
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:48,186
but I have built
a gazebo or two in my day.

461
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,232
Hold on. We just
got sent a location

462
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:52,408
of one of Marvin Reynolds'
vehicles.

463
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:54,061
Looks like he's got an RV

464
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:55,561
that's been collecting
parking tickets

465
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:57,674
on the 1600 block of Crenshaw.

466
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:59,086
We're closest.
We'll... We'll take it.

467
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,894
Heading there now.

468
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,902
Is that from your lawyer?

469
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:10,034
Uh, yeah.

470
00:18:10,077 --> 00:18:12,167
It's about
three pages of legalese

471
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:14,647
that basically comes down to,
I am screwed.

472
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:15,648
Yeah, but you're the mom.

473
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:17,476
I mean, that has to matter.

474
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,498
Yeah, I'm the mom who all
but abandoned her daughter

475
00:18:19,522 --> 00:18:21,915
when I went undercover
and then nearly got her killed.

476
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:23,743
Donovan is the one
who was there for her.

477
00:18:23,787 --> 00:18:24,962
Okay, but that was the past.

478
00:18:25,005 --> 00:18:27,399
Look, I've seen you, okay?

479
00:18:27,443 --> 00:18:29,053
You're a great mom.

480
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:31,536
Would a great mom put her kid
through a second custody battle?

481
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:33,492
I mean, last time
was a nightmare.

482
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:36,234
She had trouble sleeping.
Her school work suffered.

483
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:38,628
I just... I don't know
if I can do that again.

484
00:18:38,671 --> 00:18:40,151
There's our RV. Alright.

485
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:42,197
Be ready to bail in case
he opens fire on us.

486
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:43,545
Got that.

487
00:19:08,266 --> 00:19:09,572
Yeah, VIN matches.

488
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:11,748
This is our guy's.

489
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,111
Looks abandoned, but it don't
mean he ain't held up inside.

490
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,624
Alright. What's the play, Boot?

491
00:19:18,668 --> 00:19:20,365
Well, there's only
one entry point,

492
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,063
so we stay safe
and, uh, try to see

493
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:24,563
if we can get him to come out
with verbal commands.

494
00:19:24,587 --> 00:19:26,850
And if there's no response?

495
00:19:26,893 --> 00:19:28,025
Breach?

496
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:29,418
Or...

497
00:19:38,557 --> 00:19:39,863
Harper: Ball-Cam.

498
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:42,474
360-degree view.
It can even swim.

499
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:45,477
I am in no mood to play games
with this guy.

500
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:46,913
We just have to get it inside.

501
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,328
Man.

502
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,809
This guy is ready for war.

503
00:20:12,852 --> 00:20:14,898
So, are we going in? Hold on. One sec.

504
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:16,116
I gotta check the door,

505
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,293
make sure it's not rigged
with explosives.

506
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:19,879
Yeah, he definitely
seems like the type.

507
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:21,600
Alright, I don't see any wires.

508
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:23,385
We're all clear.

509
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:41,054
Alright. We're all clear.

510
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:43,666
Control, 7-Adam-07,
we're code 4.

511
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,709
RV is unoccupied.

512
00:20:45,972 --> 00:20:48,845
"Rebirth through
the blood of innocents."

513
00:20:48,888 --> 00:20:50,448
Looks like we got ourselves
a manifesto.

514
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,319
Control, Air Three is moving
over to the northeast grid.

515
00:20:56,363 --> 00:20:57,755
Control: Copy, Air Three.

516
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:01,237
Listen to this...

517
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:05,415
"Satanic-Hebrew Anglo-Commerce
devoured America."

518
00:21:05,459 --> 00:21:07,461
"The Cabal's slaves
have vanquished us.

519
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:09,202
Your blood flows
gutter-rivers today."

520
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:11,247
"The time is at hand
for renewal,"

521
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:13,597
and we will use
the blood of the masters

522
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:16,383
to wash away the incestuous sins

523
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:18,689
"of the corrupt adjudicators."

524
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:21,214
Barely literate
and yet truly terrifying.

525
00:21:21,257 --> 00:21:23,738
The good news is, we found
the RV with his stash of guns

526
00:21:23,781 --> 00:21:24,913
before he could get to them.

527
00:21:24,956 --> 00:21:26,480
Even if all he has
is a submachine gun,

528
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:28,675
we're still looking at a
potential mass-casualty event.

529
00:21:28,699 --> 00:21:30,614
Nolan: He post anything
to social media?

530
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:33,878
Nothing new. A dozen older
posts, tilting at windmills.

531
00:21:33,922 --> 00:21:35,837
But he's only got
like 10 followers.

532
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,752
Not sure how wide
his message spread.

533
00:21:37,795 --> 00:21:39,556
Maybe he's using a secret
platform, like 9-Chan?

534
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,885
Forensics is on that.

535
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:44,846
Got a name and work address

536
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:46,630
of a former girlfriend...
Erica Lawrence.

537
00:21:46,674 --> 00:21:48,284
Multiple domestic calls
to her home

538
00:21:48,328 --> 00:21:49,459
when they were together.

539
00:21:49,503 --> 00:21:50,523
Grey wants us to interview her.

540
00:21:50,547 --> 00:21:52,419
Right.

541
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:56,771
I think that's her.

542
00:21:57,989 --> 00:21:59,121
Yeah.

543
00:21:59,164 --> 00:22:00,164
That should be her.

544
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:02,646
Lopez: Ms. Lawrence?

545
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,995
Erica: Yes?

546
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,520
I'm Detective Lopez.
This is Officer Nolan.

547
00:22:06,563 --> 00:22:09,044
Can you tell us the last time
you saw Marvin Reynolds?

548
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:10,915
What'd he do?

549
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:12,787
Shot at us, for starters.

550
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,918
Have you seen him?

551
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:17,008
Not since last month.

552
00:22:17,052 --> 00:22:19,968
I started dating someone,
and he found out.

553
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:21,665
I was so careful
about posting anything,

554
00:22:21,709 --> 00:22:23,232
but somehow, he knew.

555
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:25,495
What happened?

556
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:27,105
He came over drunk.

557
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:30,152
He insisted on playing
Russian Roulette.

558
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:33,155
He said that
if I deserved to live, that...

559
00:22:33,198 --> 00:22:35,200
fate would save me.

560
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:36,724
H-He pulled the trigger
three times

561
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:38,682
before my brother came
and scared him off.

562
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:40,771
I'm so sorry.

563
00:22:40,815 --> 00:22:43,470
And you didn't file
a restraining order?

564
00:22:43,513 --> 00:22:45,950
I was too scared.

565
00:22:45,994 --> 00:22:48,344
I just want him
to forget I exist.

566
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:50,346
But now, do y...

567
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,870
Do you think that
he would come for me?

568
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,307
We won't let him.

569
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,980
I'll have a unit come
take you to the station

570
00:22:56,004 --> 00:22:57,527
and wait until we catch him.

571
00:22:57,571 --> 00:22:58,765
Is there anything
you can tell us

572
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:00,400
that might help us do that?

573
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:01,966
Um...

574
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,752
He used to boast
that he had weapons

575
00:23:04,795 --> 00:23:06,057
stashed all over the city,

576
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:07,581
but he never said where.

577
00:23:07,624 --> 00:23:09,496
What was he gonna use them for?

578
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:11,324
Killing people.

579
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:14,849
But I-I don't know who, exactly.

580
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:16,372
He wasn't always like this.

581
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:19,506
When I first met him,
he was intense and a bit quiet,

582
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:20,898
but he wasn't radicalized.

583
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,509
Well, what changed?

584
00:23:22,552 --> 00:23:25,729
He met this guy online...
Cooper.

585
00:23:25,773 --> 00:23:28,732
He's the one who pulled him
into the Sovereign Citizens.

586
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:31,213
Any idea where
we can find Cooper?

587
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:33,215
You know, you'd think
after the seventh time

588
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:35,062
this guy posted about
overthrowing the government,

589
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:36,523
someone might have called us.

590
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:39,917
Yeah, it's free speech,
so there's not much we can do.

591
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,397
Donovan call you back?

592
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,007
Nope.

593
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:44,158
Look, I know
you don't want to put Lila

594
00:23:44,182 --> 00:23:45,595
through any more of this
custody stuff,

595
00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:47,316
but you're not the one
who's doing this.

596
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,404
You know that, right?

597
00:23:48,448 --> 00:23:49,927
He is.

598
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:51,364
He's the one who decided
to move.

599
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:54,192
Yeah.

600
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:56,325
But?

601
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,154
I-I mean, who am I
to say that he can't?

602
00:23:59,197 --> 00:24:01,461
E-Especially after
everything that I did.

603
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,420
Okay, you know what?

604
00:24:04,464 --> 00:24:05,856
Maybe I'm wrong,

605
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,381
and maybe I'm bringing
my own experience into this,

606
00:24:08,424 --> 00:24:11,253
but I still think
you're punishing yourself.

607
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:13,187
Yeah, like, y-y-you got this
narrative going right now

608
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:16,389
where he's the saint
and you're some screw-up.

609
00:24:16,432 --> 00:24:17,825
And you know what?
I-I don't know.

610
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:20,175
I wasn't there,
a-and maybe you were terrible.

611
00:24:20,218 --> 00:24:23,134
But right now,
he's trying to take your kid,

612
00:24:23,178 --> 00:24:24,416
and you're just
letting him do it

613
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,635
because you're so eaten up
with guilt.

614
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:26,703
Like...

615
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:33,623
Cooper Sanford?
I'm Detective Lopez.

616
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,016
This is Officer Nolan.

617
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:36,385
Nolan: We're looking
for a friend of yours...

618
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:37,758
Marvin Reynolds.

619
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:39,063
Doesn't ring a bell.

620
00:24:39,107 --> 00:24:40,214
See, now,
that's a dumb thing to say,

621
00:24:40,238 --> 00:24:42,066
because clearly, it does.

622
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,653
We heard that you sold him
thousands of dollars' worth

623
00:24:43,677 --> 00:24:45,113
of Sovereign Citizen kits.

624
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:49,291
And who told you that? We're not
telling you that.

625
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:50,921
Yeah, probably
his bitch of a girlfriend.

626
00:24:50,945 --> 00:24:52,337
He dumped her and moved on.

627
00:24:52,381 --> 00:24:54,339
Can't believe anything
that she says.

628
00:24:54,383 --> 00:24:55,558
So you doknow him.

629
00:24:56,733 --> 00:24:58,909
I'm gonna need to see
your delegation of authority.

630
00:24:58,953 --> 00:25:00,433
It's right here.

631
00:25:00,476 --> 00:25:02,193
When was the last time you were
in contact with Marvin?

632
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:04,567
I don't need to answer
any of your questions.

633
00:25:04,611 --> 00:25:06,569
I'm not a citizen
of your corporation.

634
00:25:06,613 --> 00:25:07,352
My corporation?

635
00:25:07,396 --> 00:25:09,137
In 1871,

636
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,008
the United States
stopped being a country

637
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,836
and started being a corporation.

638
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,969
None of the laws passed
since then in any...

639
00:25:15,012 --> 00:25:17,450
Enough of the
Sovereign Citizen crap!

640
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:19,669
You need to educate yourself!

641
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:23,151
This "government" that you serve
sells us all into slavery!

642
00:25:23,194 --> 00:25:25,414
Marvin is planning
a terrorist act.

643
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,329
Do you understand that?

644
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:28,722
If you have any knowledge of it,

645
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:30,090
you're an accessory
after the fact,

646
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:32,552
whether you believe in the law
or not.

647
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:35,076
I'm not scared of you!

648
00:25:38,688 --> 00:25:40,168
Nolan: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

649
00:25:41,343 --> 00:25:42,692
I'm gonna cut him off.

650
00:25:47,741 --> 00:25:49,133
Clear it out. Go. Move out.

651
00:25:53,486 --> 00:25:54,530
Get out!

652
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:04,105
Cooper:

653
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:08,413
Let's try this again.

654
00:26:08,457 --> 00:26:10,938
Where's your friend?
What's he got planned?

655
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:13,549
I do not recognize
your authority.

656
00:26:13,593 --> 00:26:15,290
I do not answer questions.

657
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:17,205
You will tell me,
or a lot of people will die.

658
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:18,946
I do not recognize
your authority!

659
00:26:18,989 --> 00:26:21,470
I do not answer questions!

660
00:26:21,514 --> 00:26:22,515
I could change that.

661
00:26:23,037 --> 00:26:23,994
Aah! Come on!

662
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:25,387
What are you doing?

663
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:26,780
I need a lawyer!

664
00:26:26,823 --> 00:26:28,322
See, all these guys
embrace the legal system

665
00:26:28,346 --> 00:26:29,260
when it serves them!

666
00:26:29,304 --> 00:26:30,455
You need to stop now, Angela.

667
00:26:30,479 --> 00:26:31,436
Out of my way!

668
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,873
Take a step back.

669
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:34,309
I outrank you.

670
00:26:34,352 --> 00:26:36,093
Take a step back, ma'am.

671
00:26:38,008 --> 00:26:39,488
Aah.

672
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:43,448
She was trying to hurt me.

673
00:26:43,492 --> 00:26:46,060
No. She was trying to scare you.

674
00:26:46,103 --> 00:26:48,366
Now, I could charge you
right now with assault...

675
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,152
Yeah, and I could file
a complaint for abuse.

676
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,067
That is a stretch.

677
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:54,697
Look, I am willing to
uncuff you right now.

678
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:56,829
We can put this whole thing
in both our rearview mirrors,

679
00:26:56,853 --> 00:27:00,335
but only if you tell me
what Marvin was planning.

680
00:27:00,378 --> 00:27:02,337
Now, believe this...

681
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,732
The detective
was telling the truth.

682
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:07,753
If Marvin hurts someone
and you're withholding evidence,

683
00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:09,189
you will be charged
right alongside of him.

684
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:10,911
And good luck
telling the prison guards

685
00:27:10,954 --> 00:27:12,608
you don't believe in
their authority.

686
00:27:17,657 --> 00:27:18,875
I don't know where Marvin is.

687
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:21,225
He called me about an hour ago.

688
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:24,794
He asked me to meet him,
bring my guns.

689
00:27:26,448 --> 00:27:28,929
I told him I was all talk
and that he was on his own.

690
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,541
What did he say
he needed the guns for?

691
00:27:32,585 --> 00:27:35,631
He just said it was go time.

692
00:27:35,675 --> 00:27:38,503
And that I'd probably
never see him again.

693
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,857
Maybe I should just let it go,

694
00:27:44,881 --> 00:27:46,622
but that house
was my childhood home.

695
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,232
I don't want to tear it down.

696
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:49,190
I want another family
to live there

697
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,452
and make happy memories.

698
00:27:50,495 --> 00:27:52,019
Of course.

699
00:27:52,062 --> 00:27:54,282
I moved out 10 years ago,
and when I think of home,

700
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:56,066
I still think of
my parents' house.

701
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:59,287
What's wrong?

702
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:01,376
Tim?

703
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:06,642
Look, I know you don't feel
the same way I do,

704
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,123
but our childhood
wasn't all bad.

705
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,602
Stop.

706
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:12,256
Alright?

707
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,824
Are you really getting nostalgic
over that place?

708
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:16,826
What... What do you want?
Some other family

709
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,697
to just cuddle up
under the broken plaster

710
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:20,421
where dad slammed my head
against the wall?

711
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:22,701
Dad had a lot of demons.

712
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:24,486
Dad was a monster.

713
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:26,183
He's changed.

714
00:28:26,227 --> 00:28:28,142
You haven't seen him
in 20 years.

715
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:30,187
The only thing that's changed

716
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:31,599
is that the drinking
caught up with him.

717
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:32,886
Okay? He can't throw a punch,

718
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:34,583
but he's the same guy
underneath.

719
00:28:34,626 --> 00:28:37,891
He's not, and you'd know that
if you'd visit the hospice.

720
00:28:37,934 --> 00:28:39,414
Not in a million years.

721
00:28:39,457 --> 00:28:41,198
Wait, hospice?

722
00:28:41,242 --> 00:28:43,897
I had to move him out of
assisted living last month.

723
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:47,030
Dad's dying.

724
00:29:03,394 --> 00:29:04,395
I know you and Wesley

725
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:05,832
are going through a lot
right now,

726
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:07,224
but that's no excuse.

727
00:29:07,268 --> 00:29:08,593
I wasn't actually
going to hurt him.

728
00:29:08,617 --> 00:29:10,314
It doesn't matter.

729
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:12,316
We can't play "bad cop" anymore.

730
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,728
We have to rise above
that way of thinking

731
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:14,797
because it's corrosive.

732
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,627
You're right. I'm sorry.

733
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,976
Thank you.

734
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:23,588
Silver Honda...
That could be Marvin's car.

735
00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:25,547
Plate's a match. That's him.

736
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,289
Control, 7-Adam-15, we have eyes
on Marvin Reynolds' vehicle.

737
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:29,681
Stand by.

738
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:41,432
7-Adam-100, 7-Adam-15,

739
00:29:41,476 --> 00:29:43,434
we've cleared the vehicle,
no sign of suspect.

740
00:29:43,478 --> 00:29:44,629
Tim: Secure the location
and sit tight

741
00:29:44,653 --> 00:29:45,436
until TID arrives.

742
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,698
Copy that.

743
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:49,527
Lopez, you see this?

744
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:51,355
Oil leak.

745
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:53,401
There was a big vehicle here
parked for some time.

746
00:29:53,444 --> 00:29:55,620
The street cleaners had to
maneuver around it.

747
00:29:55,664 --> 00:29:57,100
Another weapons stash?

748
00:29:57,144 --> 00:29:59,122
So he ditched the Civic
and drove off in an arsenal?

749
00:29:59,146 --> 00:30:00,384
Woman:
You finally got rid of it.

750
00:30:00,408 --> 00:30:01,235
Rid of what?

751
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:02,714
That van.

752
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:04,779
I must've called a hundred times
trying to get it towed.

753
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,806
Well, then, uh, you must
remember some details about it?

754
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:08,938
Yeah.

755
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,074
Hey, I-I know a great
bereavement counselor,

756
00:30:14,117 --> 00:30:15,902
if you need someone to talk to.

757
00:30:15,945 --> 00:30:18,730
I have someone. Thanks.

758
00:30:18,774 --> 00:30:20,186
You know, therapy's really
helped me come to terms

759
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:22,430
with everything that happened
to us when we were kids.

760
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:25,955
It could help you, too.

761
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:27,565
I'm good.

762
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:29,741
You really don't think
you carry some trauma

763
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:31,178
from what he put you through?

764
00:30:31,221 --> 00:30:32,483
When you were 7 years old,

765
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:34,113
he dropped you in Griffith Park
with a compass

766
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:35,051
and made you find your way home.

767
00:30:35,095 --> 00:30:36,400
Which I did.

768
00:30:36,444 --> 00:30:37,880
A Tim Test.

769
00:30:37,924 --> 00:30:39,273
A what?

770
00:30:39,316 --> 00:30:40,448
Nothing. Um...

771
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:45,279
Oh. We got a hit on the van
that Nolan and Lopez I.D.'d.

772
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:47,542
It's racked up
hundreds of dollars in fines.

773
00:30:47,585 --> 00:30:48,543
Parking tickets?

774
00:30:48,586 --> 00:30:49,674
And tolls.

775
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:51,111
Where are they clustered?

776
00:30:51,154 --> 00:30:52,392
Uh, they're centered around
the Port of Los Angeles.

777
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,678
Didn't the intel report state

778
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:54,786
that Marvin used to work
down there?

779
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,159
Drove a forklift or something?

780
00:30:56,203 --> 00:30:57,310
Yeah, but he was fired
two years ago.

781
00:30:57,334 --> 00:30:58,494
Why would he be visiting now?

782
00:30:59,728 --> 00:31:01,121
I'll send some units.

783
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:05,777
Air Three has eyes
on suspect vehicle.

784
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:07,741
Northeast corner of lot A,
just off Front Street.

785
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,085
I'm gonna orbit.

786
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:11,914
Control, 7-Adam-15,
show us responding.

787
00:31:14,003 --> 00:31:16,397
Harper: Air Three, 7-Adam-07,
arriving at location.

788
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,529
Stand by.

789
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,407
Air Three, 7-Adam-07,
any movement?

790
00:31:28,322 --> 00:31:31,194
7-Adam-07, I see no movement
in suspect vehicle.

791
00:31:36,199 --> 00:31:39,376
Aaron, relax and follow my lead.

792
00:31:52,824 --> 00:31:53,824
Front seat clear.

793
00:32:07,448 --> 00:32:08,710
Clear.

794
00:32:11,104 --> 00:32:13,758
Air Three, 7-Adam-07,
no sign of suspect,

795
00:32:13,802 --> 00:32:15,934
but he is clearly well-armed.

796
00:32:15,978 --> 00:32:19,242
Marvin just posted something
to social media.

797
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:22,898
History is gonna remember
this day as Sovereigns' Day.

798
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,421
I'm about to light the spark

799
00:32:24,465 --> 00:32:26,162
that's gonna ignite
the revolution.

800
00:32:26,206 --> 00:32:28,401
Maybe we can spot something
that gives away his location.

801
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:29,731
It's hard to tell.

802
00:32:29,774 --> 00:32:31,559
And who knows
when he recorded that.

803
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,518
Aaron: I mean, why here?

804
00:32:34,562 --> 00:32:36,520
Uh, there are dozens of targets
at the port,

805
00:32:36,564 --> 00:32:39,088
from the cruise ship terminal
to the port itself.

806
00:32:39,132 --> 00:32:41,327
Yeah, or maybe he's here to kill
the boss that fired him

807
00:32:41,351 --> 00:32:42,874
and pretend
it's for some great cause.

808
00:32:45,616 --> 00:32:47,116
We're taking fire!
We need to back off!

809
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,142
Do you have a location
on the shooter?

810
00:32:49,185 --> 00:32:50,185
Negative, negative.

811
00:32:51,753 --> 00:32:52,753
Where the hell is he?

812
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:57,988
Harper: Air Three,
suspect heading north

813
00:32:58,012 --> 00:32:59,971
along the water,
armed with a long gun.

814
00:33:00,014 --> 00:33:01,600
Pilot: We're climbing to a safe
altitude, then I'll swing back.

815
00:33:01,624 --> 00:33:03,409
Police, stop!

816
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,162
Control, 7-Adam-07,
alert Long Beach Police,

817
00:33:17,205 --> 00:33:18,859
we are taking fire.

818
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:21,557
Moving to channel 13
for mutual aid.

819
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:23,864
Secure that weapon.

820
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,929
We have to stop him before
he gets on that ship.

821
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:02,207
Clear!

822
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,166
Move! Clear! Everyone, clear!

823
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,733
What do you got?

824
00:34:06,776 --> 00:34:08,058
Single shooter we've been
tracking since L.A.

825
00:34:08,082 --> 00:34:09,692
Where is he? Somewhere on that boat.

826
00:34:11,912 --> 00:34:14,741
Stay here
in case he doubles back.

827
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:16,184
Nolan: Move, move, move!
Come, come.

828
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:20,638
We should split up.

829
00:34:29,864 --> 00:34:31,562
Covering.

830
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,303
Clear. Clear.

831
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:37,263
Clear.

832
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:40,613
Clear.

833
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,531
Lopez: Holding.

834
00:34:45,793 --> 00:34:47,447
Nolan: Clear.

835
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:51,886
Holding.

836
00:34:53,497 --> 00:34:54,541
Go.

837
00:34:55,934 --> 00:34:57,457
Oh. It's okay.

838
00:34:57,501 --> 00:34:58,719
Stay calm.

839
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,044
Keep going going this way,
exit the ship.

840
00:35:00,068 --> 00:35:01,809
There's other officers
waiting outside.

841
00:35:09,861 --> 00:35:11,384
Harper: Exit out that door.

842
00:35:11,428 --> 00:35:13,038
It's a straight shot outside,
okay?

843
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:14,822
It's clear.
We just came from that way.

844
00:35:14,866 --> 00:35:15,997
Go.

845
00:35:22,003 --> 00:35:23,178
Aaron: It's all clear.

846
00:35:27,922 --> 00:35:29,620
Clear.

847
00:35:31,056 --> 00:35:32,056
Clear.

848
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:33,972
Lopez.

849
00:35:42,328 --> 00:35:44,199
Don't move! It's okay.

850
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:45,263
Whoa. You're safe, you're safe.

851
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:46,158
Please.
Please get me out of here.

852
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:47,333
Please get me out of here.

853
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:48,682
You have to let him go first.

854
00:35:48,726 --> 00:35:50,075
Okay.
I-I'm sorry. That's alright.

855
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:52,599
What is that?

856
00:35:52,643 --> 00:35:53,924
You stay here.
You'll be safe, alright?

857
00:35:53,948 --> 00:35:55,167
Please don't leave me!

858
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,734
Just lock the door behind us.

859
00:36:01,652 --> 00:36:03,175
Hey!

860
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:20,671
Lopez:

861
00:37:14,638 --> 00:37:16,814
Drop it!

862
00:37:33,629 --> 00:37:35,935
You're right. About what?

863
00:37:35,779 --> 00:37:37,607
I need to fight for Lila.

864
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:39,087
Even if I lose,
she needs to know

865
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,325
that I would do anything
for her.

866
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:41,480
You're not gonna lose.

867
00:37:45,136 --> 00:37:46,834
Yeah, I'm not so sure.

868
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:50,750
I mean, my lawyer is
a lovely person but...

869
00:37:50,794 --> 00:37:53,057
Actually, that might be
the issue.

870
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:55,581
She's too nice
to be a divorce lawyer.

871
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:58,019
Well, then hire
someone better... or worse.

872
00:37:58,062 --> 00:37:59,542
Better lawyer, worse person.

873
00:37:59,585 --> 00:38:01,587
Me and whose paycheck?

874
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:02,675
Use my lawyer.

875
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,679
She is a shark,
and she owes me one.

876
00:38:06,723 --> 00:38:08,899
The press around my trial
tripled her business.

877
00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:10,790
She'll give you
the friends and family discount.

878
00:38:10,814 --> 00:38:11,902
I'll send you the details.

879
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:14,687
Thanks. Happy to help.

880
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:17,386
Hey. Lucy: Hm?

881
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,648
Where's Genny?

882
00:38:18,691 --> 00:38:20,911
Oh, she is calling your nephews.

883
00:38:20,955 --> 00:38:23,609
Um, Tim, listen, uh...

884
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,309
Your sister needs you.

885
00:38:27,352 --> 00:38:30,312
Lucy... I-I realize that
I'm overstepping here,

886
00:38:30,355 --> 00:38:32,836
but just hear me out.

887
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,161
It's clear that
you got the worst of it

888
00:38:34,185 --> 00:38:35,186
with your father,

889
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,101
but she lived through it
with you.

890
00:38:37,145 --> 00:38:40,670
Instead of arguing about
how bad your dad was or wasn't,

891
00:38:40,713 --> 00:38:45,936
maybe as... as children
of abuse,

892
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,330
you would be better off
just supporting each other.

893
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:50,680
Hey. You ready to go?

894
00:38:50,723 --> 00:38:52,682
Yeah.

895
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:55,728
Look, I'm really sorry
about today.

896
00:38:55,772 --> 00:38:57,339
I should've listened more.

897
00:38:57,382 --> 00:38:59,167
I agree.

898
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:03,693
But thanks for saying it.
That means a lot.

899
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:05,347
I'm still not going to see him.

900
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,830
Oh, uh, Nolan,
this is my sister Genny.

901
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:12,484
Oh! Nice to finally meet you
in person.

902
00:39:12,528 --> 00:39:14,549
I'm so grateful you're willing
to help out with dad's house.

903
00:39:14,573 --> 00:39:15,923
Ah, it's my pleasure.

904
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:17,446
You know, if you're free
this weekend,

905
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,293
maybe we could go by the place,
see what needs to be done,

906
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:20,512
and you could give us
an estimate.

907
00:39:20,536 --> 00:39:22,581
Did you just say "we"?

908
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,018
As in you're gonna help?

909
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:26,846
Well, I checked out some comps
in the neighborhood,

910
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,588
and we can get a million
for that place, easy.

911
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:31,460
Plus, it shouldn't all
fall on you.

912
00:39:32,591 --> 00:39:34,289
Thanks.

913
00:39:34,332 --> 00:39:35,507
I'll see you both Saturday.

914
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:38,423
Nolan.

915
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:39,468
One second. Come here.

916
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:44,429
Hey, can I have
everyone's attention, please?

917
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:52,263
I would like to formally give
my endorsement for union rep

918
00:39:52,307 --> 00:39:56,224
to a man who has the backs of
every officer in this station...

919
00:39:58,052 --> 00:39:58,966
John Nolan.

920
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:00,924
Et tu, Bradford?

921
00:40:00,968 --> 00:40:03,579
- Alright, Nolan.
- Good endorsement.

922
00:40:03,622 --> 00:40:04,841
Yeah!

923
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,195
Thank you, guys.
Thank you very much.

924
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,980
Good job, man. Great job.

925
00:40:13,023 --> 00:40:14,087
Thank you. Don't forget to vote.

926
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,373
Don't forget to vote at all.

927
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:16,417
Thank you.

928
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,382
Is that the solution
to all your problems?

929
00:40:24,426 --> 00:40:26,036
I hope so.

930
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,101
I just hope it's enough
to make the case against Elijah.

931
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,433
Listen, about today,
don't be too hard on yourself.

932
00:40:31,476 --> 00:40:33,609
You've been going through a lot
these past few months.

933
00:40:33,652 --> 00:40:35,698
Not an excuse. I know better.

934
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:37,569
I'm just glad you were there
to remind me.

935
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:43,706
What are you doing here?

936
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:46,491
I'm doing the right thing.

937
00:40:46,535 --> 00:40:48,382
Sergeant Grey came to me
last week, offered his help.

938
00:40:48,406 --> 00:40:49,581
Today, I finally took it.

939
00:40:51,801 --> 00:40:53,020
You told him everything?

940
00:40:53,063 --> 00:40:55,022
Everything.

941
00:40:55,065 --> 00:40:57,111
From the first time I approached
Elijah until today.

942
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:58,808
How the hell does that help us?

943
00:40:58,851 --> 00:41:00,220
Because Sergeant Grey
accepted my offer

944
00:41:00,244 --> 00:41:02,333
to be a cooperating witness.

945
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:03,291
No, you're not doing that.

946
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:04,553
That will get you killed.

947
00:41:05,815 --> 00:41:07,469
I've been working all day,

948
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:08,837
and I think
with a little more digging,

949
00:41:08,861 --> 00:41:10,733
we can hang a RICO case
on Elijah.

950
00:41:10,776 --> 00:41:12,474
But any good lawyer
will swat that away.

951
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:15,390
He will never see a jail cell.

952
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,000
Well, you're not becoming a C.I.

953
00:41:18,567 --> 00:41:20,395
What about attorney-client
privilege?

954
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:21,598
That could get you disbarred.

955
00:41:22,527 --> 00:41:25,095
Some things are hard to do.

956
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:27,010
Some things are scary.

957
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:30,970
This is both,
but it's something I have to do.

958
00:41:31,014 --> 00:41:33,321
It's not for me, it's for you.
And Jack.

959
00:41:34,887 --> 00:41:37,107
So, look, Angela,
I've already got calls in

960
00:41:37,151 --> 00:41:40,371
to the State's Attorney General
and District Attorney.

961
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:42,243
They already got a game plan,

962
00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:45,985
and I will personally oversee
how Wesley is utilized.

963
00:41:46,029 --> 00:41:48,075
I promise.

964
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:50,425
I will do everything humanly
possible to keep him safe.

965
00:41:53,602 --> 00:41:55,517
I need you to tell me
this is okay.

966
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,910
I won't do it
without your support.

967
00:42:02,132 --> 00:42:03,568
We can't screw this up.

968
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:07,050
Not a single mistake.

969
00:42:07,094 --> 00:42:08,530
Not one.

970
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:10,923
We won't. I promise you.

971
