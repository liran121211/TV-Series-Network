1
00:00:00,535 --> 00:00:01,621
<i>Previously on "The Rookie"...</i>

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,863
- Bailey.
- Jason.

3
00:00:02,912 --> 00:00:04,760
- I'm John Nolan. And you are?
- Her husband.

4
00:00:04,809 --> 00:00:05,980
I'm trying to protect this city.

5
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:08,189
So you think putting
a 16-year-old into juvie

6
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:10,259
is gonna turn the tide
in the war on drugs?

7
00:00:10,307 --> 00:00:12,795
I am in a good place. James is great.

8
00:00:12,843 --> 00:00:14,353
- What did you find out?
- Jason Wyler

9
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:16,064
is the most charming man on the planet.

10
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:17,733
<i>He whispers in all the right ears,</i>

11
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:18,592
and whoever is his enemy,

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,269
ends up on the wrong end of a shank.

13
00:00:20,317 --> 00:00:21,937
What is happening? Why am I...

14
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:23,205
He's framing me.

15
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:24,533
Hearing that she's finally

16
00:00:24,581 --> 00:00:25,761
facing some consequences,

17
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,775
- it does well for my spirit.
- I know who you are now.

18
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:29,482
And I'm coming for you.

19
00:00:30,098 --> 00:00:31,378
Let's talk about what's next.

20
00:00:31,426 --> 00:00:33,013
Well, it's pretty straightforward.

21
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:35,048
You can go to trial, fight the charges,

22
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:36,793
or take a plea.

23
00:00:36,842 --> 00:00:38,410
And if I fight and lose?

24
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:40,400
Most likely, you'll do prison time.

25
00:00:41,257 --> 00:00:43,070
And if I take a plea?

26
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:44,342
I feel confident,

27
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,191
that we could get

28
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,827
a mandatory treatment program
and probation.

29
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,730
But I would still have
a drug charge on my record,

30
00:00:50,778 --> 00:00:52,067
and at minimum,

31
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:53,566
I would be out of the Army Reserve

32
00:00:53,614 --> 00:00:57,137
and I'd probably be fired
from the LAFD.

33
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,978
I would lose everything
that matters to me.

34
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,751
Except for you.

35
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:03,979
What?

36
00:01:04,028 --> 00:01:05,296
It's nothing.

37
00:01:05,442 --> 00:01:06,979
It's not nothing.

38
00:01:07,028 --> 00:01:08,520
And I can't take another round

39
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,887
- of gaslighting right now.
- Okay, so,

40
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:12,442
the Department frowns

41
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,555
on officers fraternizing
with convicted felons.

42
00:01:15,603 --> 00:01:17,739
They can frown all they want.

43
00:01:17,788 --> 00:01:18,846
They can't fire me.

44
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:21,194
Everyone who's important
knows you're innocent.

45
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:24,044
But just dating me would hold you back.

46
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:26,582
I gotta give it to Jason...

47
00:01:26,631 --> 00:01:28,699
he really planned this perfectly.

48
00:01:29,067 --> 00:01:31,259
You know, there is still
a third option.

49
00:01:31,864 --> 00:01:34,866
We prove your innocence
and we take him down.

50
00:01:39,238 --> 00:01:40,764
Morning.

51
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:43,401
Um...

52
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:45,485
What were you doing up all night?

53
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,127
Legal research.

54
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:48,557
Researching what?

55
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:49,705
Do you remember that, uh,

56
00:01:49,753 --> 00:01:51,391
kid I was telling you about... Tyler?

57
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,079
- Oh, the one who robbed the liquor store...
- Yes.

58
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:55,228
and then gave the store owner
a heart attack,

59
00:01:55,346 --> 00:01:57,764
and the clown from the DA's
office blamed you for it?

60
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,199
No, I don't remember that.

61
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,370
Anyway, good news...

62
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:06,138
um, the store owner
was released from the hospital.

63
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:07,507
She's gonna be fine.

64
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:09,676
Amazing. I bet Tyler's relieved.

65
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:11,267
Yeah, but he's not
out of the woods yet.

66
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:12,463
I have been up all night

67
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:13,549
trying to research ways that

68
00:02:13,597 --> 00:02:15,181
the state can show him leniency.

69
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:17,134
I've just got to convince that clown

70
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:18,751
to charge him as a minor.

71
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:21,275
Well, Tyler's lucky he
has you looking out for him.

72
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:22,589
- Aww.
- I knew I was.

73
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:23,957
Oh.

74
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,122
I mean, not that long ago,

75
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:27,142
I was on the streets,
as desperate as he was,

76
00:02:27,191 --> 00:02:30,248
and then I did the smartest
thing I think I've ever done...

77
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:31,448
Steal your car.

78
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:33,247
Okay. Agree to disagree.

79
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:35,884
No, seriously. Crime totally pays.

80
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:37,794
And Tyler's lucky to have you.

81
00:02:38,504 --> 00:02:39,593
You're cute!

82
00:02:39,642 --> 00:02:40,708
This is nice.

83
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:43,280
Actually spending the night together.

84
00:02:43,451 --> 00:02:45,969
Doing couple things
in the morning before work.

85
00:02:46,544 --> 00:02:48,518
Yeah, who knew we had
to share custody schedules

86
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:49,854
before we hooked up?

87
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,216
I actually should get going though,
I gotta...

88
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:53,372
I gotta do a thing.

89
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:54,700
That sounds ominous.

90
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:56,667
No, it's fine. I just have to have a,

91
00:02:56,716 --> 00:02:58,317
a talk with Curtis Jones.

92
00:02:58,412 --> 00:02:59,932
About Tyler.

93
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:02,700
Wait. Is he still leaning
on Tyler's family for money?

94
00:03:02,803 --> 00:03:05,091
Yeah, and I-I need to convince Curtis

95
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,126
to cut his losses and let it go.

96
00:03:07,174 --> 00:03:08,761
Okay, well, I'm coming with you.

97
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:11,297
- No.
- Yes, I'm...

98
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:12,599
Nyla, no.

99
00:03:12,794 --> 00:03:14,255
No, you can't be there. Look, if,

100
00:03:14,303 --> 00:03:15,747
if word gets out that a cop

101
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:17,384
is hovering on my shoulder,

102
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:19,473
they'll stop trusting me.

103
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:22,568
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but you're dating a cop,

104
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:23,753
so that's gonna get around.

105
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:26,612
I know, which means
I have to work extra hard

106
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,407
to stay independent.

107
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:30,617
Look, if I lose the trust
with the community,

108
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:32,261
I'll never get it back.

109
00:03:32,767 --> 00:03:34,363
I hear you, but I don't like it.

110
00:03:34,412 --> 00:03:37,125
And Curtis is a dangerous guy, and...

111
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:38,458
If anything were to happen to you,

112
00:03:38,506 --> 00:03:41,689
I'd be sad for, like,
at least a couple days.

113
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,194
Funny. Funny.

114
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:46,232
But I can handle myself.

115
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,010
Alright?

116
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,477
I'll call you after.

117
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:53,731
I wish we could open an official
investigation on this.

118
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,163
No, sir, I get it, there's not even

119
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:57,186
circumstantial evidence
connecting Jason

120
00:03:57,249 --> 00:03:58,544
to planting those drugs.

121
00:03:58,593 --> 00:04:01,147
Thank you, again, for authorizing my...

122
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:03,149
- "vacation."
- Of course.

123
00:04:03,197 --> 00:04:04,929
Take as much time as you need.

124
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:06,619
So, what's your plan?

125
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:07,879
Find the money.

126
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,435
I mean, those drugs cost upwards
of 10 grand,

127
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:12,718
but according to my skip tracer,
Jason's broke.

128
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,006
He had to pay restitution

129
00:04:14,062 --> 00:04:15,286
for his embezzlement conviction,

130
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:16,903
and he's been working
a minimum-wage job

131
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:18,164
ever since his release.

132
00:04:18,212 --> 00:04:20,530
So chances are, he's mixed up
in something illegal

133
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,166
that gives him access
to money or drugs or both.

134
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:25,503
And I'm gonna follow him till
I find out exactly what it is.

135
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:27,464
Call me as soon as you have
something actionable,

136
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:30,530
even if it's a simple parole violation.

137
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:32,779
Once he's in custody,
he's more likely to crack.

138
00:04:35,436 --> 00:04:37,286
I gotta go. Caught a homicide.

139
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:39,272
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Thank you.

140
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:40,987
Say, listen, Nolan,

141
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:42,914
there's something
you need to think about.

142
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,827
If Bailey assumes fault
for the drugs...

143
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:48,461
I know, if I can't prove
Jason planted those drugs,

144
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:50,029
I'll have to choose between my career

145
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:51,737
and the woman I love.

146
00:04:52,346 --> 00:04:53,855
No biggie.

147
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:55,327
Thanks.

148
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,005
ADA Sanford.

149
00:04:58,491 --> 00:04:59,590
Officer Chen.

150
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,128
Did you hear the news?

151
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:03,876
The store owner from
Tyler's case pulled through.

152
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:05,343
- I heard.
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:05:05,392 --> 00:05:06,827
I'm as relieved as you are.

154
00:05:07,498 --> 00:05:08,856
Great. So,

155
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:10,460
let's continue, with the positivity.

156
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:12,537
Charge Tyler as a minor.

157
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,390
He committed a crime with a gun.

158
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,822
It was unloaded.

159
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,558
Look, I'm not saying that
there shouldn't be consequences,

160
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:20,193
but he's 16.

161
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:23,202
He's not old enough to drink,
vote, join the military,

162
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,374
and you want to lock him up

163
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:25,975
with a bunch of grown men?

164
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,796
- Look, studies show that...
- No, please,

165
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,101
don't quote studies at me.

166
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,903
And definitely don't start lecturing me

167
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:32,572
about the science
of stilldeveloping brains

168
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,171
in men under 21.

169
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:35,608
I wasn't gonna do that.

170
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:39,746
Look, if Tyler becomes a CI
against his crew,

171
00:05:39,794 --> 00:05:41,581
I can definitely give him a break.

172
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:42,679
Uh...

173
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:44,257
Wait, s-sorry. Let me...

174
00:05:44,305 --> 00:05:45,351
Let me just get this clear.

175
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,120
So, instead of risking his life
in prison,

176
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:49,021
you want to risk his life
on the streets?

177
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:50,327
Do you understand that he is

178
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:51,724
a low-level drug runner?

179
00:05:51,772 --> 00:05:53,839
He is the bottom of the food chain.

180
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,135
Nobody in his crew is
gonna even trust him,

181
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:57,348
with any real intel.

182
00:05:57,436 --> 00:05:59,200
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

183
00:05:59,249 --> 00:06:01,473
Mr., uh, Rookie ADA here

184
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:03,703
was telling me
how he was gonna make his bones

185
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:06,439
- by ending a kid's life.
- Okay.

186
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:08,941
You're clearly feeling a
little dramatic this morning,

187
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:10,789
and I have to go to court.

188
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:16,208
I will be following up with you!

189
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,133
Can you believe the nerve of that guy,

190
00:06:18,181 --> 00:06:19,619
calling <i>me</i> dramatic?

191
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,621
I mean... Um, do not start.

192
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:23,071
Exactly how many cups of coffee

193
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,525
did you have this morning?

194
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:26,805
I'm just going to apologize
to you right now.

195
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:29,126
Um, it's gonna be a really
long day for you, and...

196
00:06:29,175 --> 00:06:30,730
And I'm sorry.

197
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:33,180
- Aaron.
- Mom, what are you doing here?

198
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,967
Hi, baby. Mwah.

199
00:06:35,015 --> 00:06:36,969
Look at you in this uniform.

200
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:38,971
How handsome.

201
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:41,741
Look, I said no yesterday,
and I meant it, okay?

202
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,342
- Uh-huh.
- So please stop asking.

203
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,727
But you're not thinking it through.

204
00:06:44,776 --> 00:06:46,826
- The hell I'm not.
- Whoa, what's the problem?

205
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,290
Nothing, just having a
conversation with my mother.

206
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:51,156
Now I know you did not just speak

207
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:53,063
to your mother in that tone.

208
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:54,731
Ma'am, I am Nyla Harper,

209
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:56,211
Aaron's training officer,

210
00:06:56,344 --> 00:06:58,791
and he is going to apologize
to you right now,

211
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,782
or I will write him up, for conduct

212
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,696
unbecoming of an officer.

213
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:07,710
I'm sorry.

214
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:09,124
Thank you.

215
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:10,303
And thank you, Nyla.

216
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:11,430
Of course, Mrs. Thorsen.

217
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:13,632
- It's Yvonne.
- Yvonne.

218
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,755
See you in the shop.

219
00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:16,860
Oh.

220
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:17,912
I like her.

221
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:19,645
- Look, Mom...
- I like her.

222
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:21,102
I'm sorry for going off, okay?

223
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:23,005
But I don't want to be a part
of this reality TV show.

224
00:07:23,054 --> 00:07:24,945
Sweetie, it's only gonna help you.

225
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,055
How?

226
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:28,454
By disrespecting the memory of Patrick?

227
00:07:28,502 --> 00:07:30,212
By trivializing the time
I've spent in prison

228
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:31,381
for a crime I didn't commit?

229
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,148
Not if we control the narrative.

230
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:34,350
Mom,

231
00:07:34,475 --> 00:07:35,662
I love you, okay?

232
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:37,469
You've been on my side
through everything, but,

233
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:38,698
the answer's no.

234
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,450
Now I have to go.

235
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:51,289
I think this may be
our strangest date yet.

236
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:53,837
Really? Stranger than
fighting a Russian spy?

237
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:57,085
We're surveilling your
excon current husband

238
00:07:57,134 --> 00:07:58,844
who has framed you for a drug crime.

239
00:07:58,933 --> 00:08:01,969
<i>Estranged</i> ex-con current husband.

240
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:03,683
Oh, good.

241
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:06,092
- Hey, Randy.
<i>- Skip Tracer Randy here!</i>

242
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,892
Yes. I know, Randy.

243
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,992
I said your name.

244
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,131
<i>Oh, well, maybe you know
12 Randys, I don't know.</i>

245
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,398
<i>Would you like to know what I found,</i>

246
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:13,845
<i>or do you want to keep</i>
<i>making me feel bad</i>

247
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,437
<i>about how I put myself out</i>
<i>in the world?</i>

248
00:08:15,486 --> 00:08:17,168
No. No, Randy, you're right.

249
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:18,905
I'm sorry. What did you get?

250
00:08:18,953 --> 00:08:21,941
<i>Jason listed an SRO downtown
as his current address,</i>

251
00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:23,409
<i>but the man at the front desk says</i>

252
00:08:23,457 --> 00:08:25,037
<i>he's only seen him once or twice.</i>

253
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:26,617
So he could be staying somewhere else.

254
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,986
That could be a
violation of his parole.

255
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:29,233
Mm-hmm.
- <i>That is correct.</i>

256
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:31,178
<i>I'll call back if I find anything else.</i>

257
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:32,358
Thank you, Randy.

258
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:33,686
Well, that makes sense.

259
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,508
Jason is a total snob.

260
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,866
Is this really the best we can do?

261
00:08:38,915 --> 00:08:40,822
Just spy on him until he hopefully

262
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,502
does something overtly criminal?

263
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:43,710
Welcome to police work.

264
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,931
We're never gonna catch him
by being reactive.

265
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,051
He's too smart.

266
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:48,512
We have to get in his head.

267
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,494
If that's, really,

268
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:51,836
what you want to do,

269
00:08:51,885 --> 00:08:54,123
I know who to talk to, but it would

270
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:56,017
officially cement this as

271
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:58,867
1,000% the strangest date yet.

272
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:00,486
Well, when you put it that way...

273
00:09:02,869 --> 00:09:05,476
At this point, you should
probably deputize me.

274
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,101
<i>Hello.</i>

275
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,532
Who did you bring for me, John?

276
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,994
Oscar, this is Lieutenant Nune.

277
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:13,082
Bailey.

278
00:09:13,131 --> 00:09:14,962
I'm Jason Wyler's...

279
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,752
- Wife.
- Well, I'd salute you,

280
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,707
but I can't get my
arm over my shoulder.

281
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,043
I'm told you're an expert,

282
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:23,029
in narcissist psychopaths.

283
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:24,532
Guilty as charged.

284
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,281
Literally.

285
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,216
We need your help
to get inside his head,

286
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:29,751
figure out what he's gonna do next.

287
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,386
And I would love to do that.

288
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:33,826
I just need to figure out
what I get out of it.

289
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,102
Oscar.

290
00:09:35,151 --> 00:09:36,630
I wrote a letter,

291
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,188
to get you transferred out of here.

292
00:09:38,237 --> 00:09:39,791
And that's what I got yesterday.

293
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,427
Let's discuss what I get today.

294
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:42,963
Today, I go to the Warden's office

295
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:44,518
and rip up yesterday's letter.

296
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:45,955
- You're bluffing.
- Let's go.

297
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:47,655
Okay, fine. I'll help you.

298
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:49,877
Um, alright, where do we stand?

299
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,429
Jason and I were married for a year,

300
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:53,649
before he went to prison.

301
00:09:53,698 --> 00:09:56,653
During that time,
he was psychologically abusive,

302
00:09:56,702 --> 00:09:59,962
he tore me down constantly,
and terrorized me,

303
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,402
when I asked for a divorce.

304
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,759
Two weeks ago, he got out of jail and,

305
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:06,021
set out to ruin my life.

306
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:08,127
He planted drugs in her car
and got her arrested.

307
00:10:08,176 --> 00:10:09,627
Okay, so...

308
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:11,192
He's highly intelligent,

309
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:13,962
he's very good at getting
inside people's heads,

310
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,988
and pitting people against one another.

311
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:17,983
<i>He's also deeply insecure.</i>

312
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:20,189
That's why he's constantly
pounding you down,

313
00:10:20,238 --> 00:10:21,377
making you small.

314
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,408
It's the only way
he can make himself big.

315
00:10:23,528 --> 00:10:25,411
How do we use that against him?

316
00:10:26,422 --> 00:10:29,105
Well, best way to throw
him off of his game is...

317
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:30,975
Demean him.

318
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:33,148
Make him feel stupid.

319
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:34,649
Belittle him.

320
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,469
Of course, he's gonna retaliate,
like, ten-fold.

321
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,024
How did he get his hands on those drugs

322
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:42,517
- in the first place?
- Probably a contact in prison.

323
00:10:42,637 --> 00:10:44,047
Whoever it was he was paying

324
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,446
for protection on the inside.

325
00:10:45,495 --> 00:10:47,716
But he wouldn't have gotten
the drugs for free.

326
00:10:47,765 --> 00:10:49,192
Well, it's not hard to get money,

327
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,903
I mean,
if you're willing to con someone.

328
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:52,400
In fact, there's an entire network

329
00:10:52,448 --> 00:10:53,728
of nightingales out there

330
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:55,892
<i>that are just waiting
to help rehabilitate</i>

331
00:10:55,941 --> 00:10:58,164
some poor, misunderstood man.

332
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:59,920
Speaking from experience?

333
00:11:00,023 --> 00:11:02,385
I get a little money in
my commissary account.

334
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:05,417
They get a romantic fantasy.

335
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:07,089
I mean...

336
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:09,451
Everybody wins.

337
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:11,974
Now, your boy, though,
he's playing the long game.

338
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:14,896
<i>He's probably targeted
a dozen or so women</i>

339
00:11:14,945 --> 00:11:16,483
just to find the right one.

340
00:11:16,705 --> 00:11:18,659
The warden will have
copies of all of Jason's mail.

341
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,844
- We can start there.
- Yeah.

342
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,235
Alright. Thank you.

343
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:35,830
Thanks.

344
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:36,992
You called us?

345
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:39,681
Yeah, a jogger found a
female DB under the overpass.

346
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:42,017
<i>Blunt force trauma to the head.
Dump job.</i>

347
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:44,494
<i>Looks like she's been here
about 24 hours.</i>

348
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:47,308
<i>Found an ID on her.
Rebecca Price, 18 years old.</i>

349
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:48,607
Sounds like you got it handled.

350
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:50,278
What do you need a sergeant for?

351
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:52,386
I don't. I need Lucy.

352
00:11:52,864 --> 00:11:54,494
Do you know her?

353
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:56,503
No. Uh, why?

354
00:11:57,355 --> 00:11:59,099
Your roommate does.

355
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,173
Alright, how do you want
to handle this?

356
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,622
I don't know. I've...

357
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,162
I've never delivered
a death notification

358
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,700
to someone I care about.

359
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:18,998
I know what to do as a cop,

360
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:21,217
and I know how to do it as a roommate,
but, you know,

361
00:12:21,265 --> 00:12:23,154
those are different approaches.

362
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,670
Just be a friend.

363
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,972
And if you need a cop, tag me in.

364
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,170
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

365
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,724
Come in.

366
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,611
Forget something?

367
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,190
No.

368
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:42,593
They found a body, this morning.

369
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:47,526
It was your friend. Becca.

370
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:49,467
What?

371
00:12:49,599 --> 00:12:50,795
No.

372
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,254
I'm sorry.

373
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:53,762
No, no, no.

374
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:54,967
No, i-it can't be her.

375
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:56,115
It wasn't Becca.

376
00:12:56,163 --> 00:12:57,795
- I'll call her.
- I'm sorry.

377
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,956
It definitely was her.

378
00:13:00,657 --> 00:13:03,111
There was a photo of the
two of you on her phone.

379
00:13:06,189 --> 00:13:07,414
Oh, look.

380
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:08,615
Here's one of mine.

381
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:10,923
A desperate plea
to respond to my lawyer.

382
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:12,436
Fun memento.

383
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,969
Here's one from Jason
to an Evelyn Reed.

384
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:17,123
"When we met, I was so broken."

385
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,450
"You healed me."

386
00:13:18,721 --> 00:13:21,695
Oh, he's still using
the same material he used on me.

387
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:23,358
I can't believe I was this stupid.

388
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:25,203
No, you weren't stupid.
You were just...

389
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:26,638
Trusting.

390
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:28,674
Here's one from Evelyn back to Jason.

391
00:13:28,993 --> 00:13:30,115
"Dear Jason,"

392
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:32,358
"I must have read your
last letter a thousand times."

393
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:34,646
"Though steel bars may
separate our bodies,"

394
00:13:34,768 --> 00:13:36,655
"they can't separate our souls."

395
00:13:36,704 --> 00:13:37,824
Barf.

396
00:13:37,873 --> 00:13:39,234
But that does sound like someone

397
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:40,859
who would do anything for him.

398
00:13:40,911 --> 00:13:42,214
What's her address?

399
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:45,064
Did Becca ever mention
someone she was scared of?

400
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:46,813
No.

401
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:49,766
But we haven't talked in a while.

402
00:13:50,022 --> 00:13:51,736
Almost three months.

403
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:53,909
With school and

404
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:56,064
moving in here, I just lost track.

405
00:13:56,116 --> 00:13:58,771
Okay, any idea where she was crashing?

406
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,797
She mostly lived on the street.

407
00:14:03,094 --> 00:14:06,316
There was a shelter
that sometimes had room.

408
00:14:06,451 --> 00:14:09,175
And a couple of kids
who had families who'd

409
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,888
let you sleep on the
floor every once in a while.

410
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:14,014
And if you were desperate enough,

411
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:15,877
there was always swiping.

412
00:14:17,476 --> 00:14:19,243
What's that?

413
00:14:20,904 --> 00:14:22,600
You go on ClipTalk,

414
00:14:22,648 --> 00:14:25,971
and just swipe until you
find someone to hook up with.

415
00:14:26,217 --> 00:14:27,915
And if you're lucky,

416
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:31,443
you might get a warm shower and a meal,

417
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:33,186
when it's all over.

418
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:34,891
<i>Okay, if she was still
doing that,</i>

419
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,787
we need a list of the guys
she met up with.

420
00:14:36,864 --> 00:14:38,314
I'll reach out to the tech department,

421
00:14:38,362 --> 00:14:39,682
see if they can get into her account.

422
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,318
No. I bet I can guess her password.

423
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:43,866
<i>So,
what's the deal with your mom?</i>

424
00:14:43,914 --> 00:14:46,374
That is a long
and boring story.

425
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:48,709
Which, stakeouts are made for.

426
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:50,267
Oh, is that what we're doing here?

427
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:52,784
- Who are we staking out?
- We're just keeping an eye on a friend.

428
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:53,920
<i>Is it one of those guys?</i>

429
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:55,323
<i>Stop trying to change the subject.</i>

430
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:57,370
- You and your mom.
- Look, it's complicated.

431
00:14:57,491 --> 00:14:59,131
You're gonna have to threaten me with a
blue page,

432
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:00,303
if you want me to say any more.

433
00:15:00,352 --> 00:15:01,590
Alright. Fair enough.

434
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:05,506
Oh, now it makes sense.

435
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:06,675
<i>Why didn't you just say we was here</i>

436
00:15:06,724 --> 00:15:08,764
- <i>to watch your boyfriend's back?
- Look, James is looking out</i>

437
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:09,746
<i>for a neighborhood kid.</i>

438
00:15:09,795 --> 00:15:11,531
<i>He's pushing back
against a local dealer,</i>

439
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,100
so we are here in case
anything goes sideways.

440
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:17,029
Look, I heard you're still
trying to collect Tyler's debt

441
00:15:17,078 --> 00:15:18,522
from some of his family members.

442
00:15:18,571 --> 00:15:19,891
The kid owes me.

443
00:15:20,248 --> 00:15:21,613
Curtis, he-he's in jail

444
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:23,002
'cause he tried to get your money.

445
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,104
It's not my fault he can't
stick up a liquor store.

446
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,053
Uh, Harper.

447
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:31,507
You have got to be kidding me.

448
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,110
<i>I assume we should stop him, yeah?</i>

449
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,678
7-Adam-19,

450
00:15:36,726 --> 00:15:38,295
Code 6 on a 459.

451
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:41,833
Suspect is a Hispanic male,
blue jeans, grey jacket.

452
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:46,043
Hey! Stop right there!

453
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:47,645
Stop! Hey!

454
00:16:08,228 --> 00:16:09,677
Hey. You okay?

455
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:10,783
You alright?

456
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:11,984
You okay? You okay?

457
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:15,643
- Oh, that's deep.
- You're gonna need stitches.

458
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:17,451
Yeah, and couple's therapy.

459
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,974
I don't follow.

460
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:20,977
I promised James
I'd mind my own business.

461
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:22,402
Yeah, you're definitely busted.

462
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,891
7-Adam-19.

463
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,603
I need additional units
to follow our 459 suspect,

464
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,939
last seen at Grant and Lennox.

465
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,685
I also need an RA
for an injured officer.

466
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,673
Alright, Lopez sent a PDF
of Becca's ClipTalk account.

467
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:37,370
It looks like
she was routinely hooking up

468
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:38,973
with four different guys.

469
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:40,982
No DMs indicating that they made plans

470
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,381
to meet up in the past week.

471
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:43,989
Yeah, well, Lopez should
look into all of them.

472
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,576
ClipTalk might not be
the only way they communicate.

473
00:16:47,662 --> 00:16:49,088
You okay?

474
00:16:49,326 --> 00:16:50,709
Yeah, Tamara knew about the whole

475
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:53,167
swiping thing, like, right away.

476
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:55,005
Did you get the impression that maybe

477
00:16:55,053 --> 00:16:56,562
she used to do it herself?

478
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:59,076
She ever mention it to you?

479
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:00,623
As close as we are, there's a lot

480
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,834
she won't talk about.

481
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:02,974
Don't take it personally.

482
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,611
She might just have a hard time
opening up to you.

483
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:08,429
But I'm sure Tamara will
share when she's ready to.

484
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,025
Who are you?

485
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,701
- I'm Jason's wife.
- Right.

486
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:16,400
The bitch who won't give him a divorce

487
00:17:16,464 --> 00:17:17,634
'cause she's obsessed, and you're

488
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:18,797
the crooked cop boyfriend.

489
00:17:18,846 --> 00:17:20,198
- Excuse me?
- Okay.

490
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,420
Ma'am, none of that is true.

491
00:17:22,469 --> 00:17:24,460
- May we come in and talk?
- Hell no.

492
00:17:24,564 --> 00:17:26,830
Ms. Reed, Jason is a dangerous

493
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:28,791
and manipulative man
who may be involved

494
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,972
in illegal activities.

495
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:32,381
- Lies.
- Okay, how about this?

496
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,117
Is Jason living here?

497
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,963
Because if he is, he has not reported

498
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:37,203
this address to his PO,

499
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:38,588
which means I can report the violation

500
00:17:38,636 --> 00:17:40,181
of his parole in one phone call.

501
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,607
If you've aided in any of the crimes

502
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:42,906
he's committed in any way,

503
00:17:42,955 --> 00:17:45,151
you can be charged as an accessory.

504
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:46,673
Or...

505
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:48,918
How about we just talk?

506
00:17:50,999 --> 00:17:53,654
Jason said that you
might try to get me to

507
00:17:53,912 --> 00:17:55,682
turn on him.

508
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:58,142
It isn't gonna work, so,

509
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,318
come in and say
whatever you have to say,

510
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:01,895
and then go.

511
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:05,121
He told you about his mother, right?

512
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,341
How close they were?

513
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,344
How broken he was when she died?

514
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,731
- May I sit?
- Uh-huh.

515
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:16,144
That was what first drew me to him.

516
00:18:16,357 --> 00:18:18,311
That depth of feeling.

517
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,857
When we first met,
my father had just died,

518
00:18:20,905 --> 00:18:22,561
and I was a wreck.

519
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:26,021
Jason was the only person
who understood.

520
00:18:26,331 --> 00:18:28,834
He didn't try to fix me.
He just listened.

521
00:18:28,883 --> 00:18:32,172
He held my hand,
made me his entire world.

522
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:34,519
So I made him mine.

523
00:18:34,742 --> 00:18:36,992
I had no one else but him.

524
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:41,393
And he started chipping away at me.

525
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:43,995
I wasn't smart enough,

526
00:18:44,385 --> 00:18:46,503
thin enough, pretty enough.

527
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:49,120
But I was lucky to have him...

528
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:53,300
because who else could ever want me?

529
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,687
I wanted to die.

530
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,410
I was even planning how I would do it.

531
00:19:08,284 --> 00:19:10,263
That was when I finally woke up.

532
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:11,841
I'm sorry.

533
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:17,404
Forgive me for asking.

534
00:19:17,453 --> 00:19:20,041
- Is Jason's car in your name?
- Yeah.

535
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,853
Because he's an ex-con, so he said it

536
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:24,414
would be hard for him to get a loan.

537
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,959
Has he ever asked you to make large

538
00:19:26,007 --> 00:19:28,001
- cash deposits?
- Yes.

539
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:29,582
And where do you think
that money comes from?

540
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,037
I didn't ask.

541
00:19:31,138 --> 00:19:33,296
Has he ever asked you to buy a gun?

542
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:35,421
Am I in trouble?

543
00:19:36,726 --> 00:19:38,299
Not if you help us.

544
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:41,763
So sorry to keep you waiting.

545
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,082
Yeah, uh, I'm all stitched
and ready to go,

546
00:19:44,131 --> 00:19:45,684
so why did I have to hang around?

547
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:47,253
Your lab work came back,

548
00:19:47,301 --> 00:19:49,421
and I wanted to talk to you about it.

549
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:51,201
What? Am I...

550
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:53,447
- Am I sick or something?
- No.

551
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,184
You're six weeks pregnant.

552
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:02,423
There you go.

553
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,619
- It's all yours.
- Thank you.

554
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,877
- We really appreciate this.
- I'm just...

555
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:09,384
I'm glad I found out the
truth before it was too late.

556
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,430
Oh, there's one more thing.

557
00:20:11,658 --> 00:20:13,179
Alright,
you think there's something in here

558
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:14,322
we can use against him?

559
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,867
Well, Jason is good,
but he's far from perfect.

560
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:18,258
He's gonna mess up at some point.

561
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:19,961
We just need to be there when he does.

562
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,408
Hey. I'm home

563
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:23,077
and I'm starving.

564
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,427
What the hell are you doing here?

565
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:30,679
Th-this is harassment, alright?

566
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:32,499
Uh, you-you both need to leave.

567
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:34,283
You okay, babe?

568
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:35,732
You don't have to listen to
them, you know?

569
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,953
- You have rights.
- I know.

570
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:41,909
Get out.

571
00:20:41,957 --> 00:20:43,697
What? Oh, come on.

572
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:45,771
I-I told you,
they're trying to frame me.

573
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,861
Now, you are too smart to fall for

574
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:49,469
whatever it is that
they're trying to tell you.

575
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:50,993
Bailey told me everything.

576
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:54,198
You used all the same lies on
her that you used on me.

577
00:20:54,247 --> 00:20:57,984
Bailey is a very sick woman,

578
00:20:58,124 --> 00:20:59,752
a drug addict, paranoid, delusional...

579
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,521
No, I need you to leave now.

580
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,273
This is my house,

581
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:04,747
and I want you to leave.

582
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,212
And don't bother coming back.

583
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:08,283
A restraining order will be
filed before you hit the street.

584
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:10,314
Well, I look forward
to having your badge

585
00:21:10,363 --> 00:21:12,593
after I win my lawsuit
against the LAPD.

586
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:14,763
Hey, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

587
00:21:14,863 --> 00:21:16,377
- That stays here.
- That's mine.

588
00:21:16,426 --> 00:21:17,894
No, it's <i>mine.</i>

589
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:21,172
I paid for this.
I paid for all of that.

590
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:22,610
Fine.

591
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,607
Oh! Want me to light them up?

592
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,344
What?

593
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,158
That green car
just made an illegal turn.

594
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:41,897
Oh, uh...

595
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:43,365
No.

596
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,131
Are you okay?

597
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:47,599
I mean, you've been pretty quiet since

598
00:21:47,647 --> 00:21:49,277
we left the hospital.

599
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,145
Nah, it's just, uh...

600
00:21:52,627 --> 00:21:54,061
Uh, I'm pregnant.

601
00:21:55,504 --> 00:21:56,693
Oh!

602
00:21:57,593 --> 00:21:58,986
Congratulations?

603
00:21:59,174 --> 00:22:01,189
Yeah, I mean, uh, they just

604
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:03,092
told me at the hospital.

605
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:04,658
And it was unexpected, huh?

606
00:22:07,276 --> 00:22:09,033
Uh, after Lila,

607
00:22:09,081 --> 00:22:11,099
I had some serious complications,

608
00:22:11,147 --> 00:22:12,869
and I was told that

609
00:22:13,253 --> 00:22:14,993
I couldn't get pregnant.

610
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:19,018
Clearly, I should have
followed up with a specialist.

611
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:21,556
Are you worried about how James
is gonna take the news?

612
00:22:21,964 --> 00:22:24,245
James is amazing.

613
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:27,433
But we've only been together
a few months, and I...

614
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:29,584
- We never thought that...
- Yeah.

615
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,420
That sounds like a lot to process.

616
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:33,755
Yeah.

617
00:22:33,803 --> 00:22:35,436
So, what are you gonna do?

618
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:39,236
Avoid dealing with it
until absolutely necessary.

619
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:41,185
Yeah.

620
00:22:41,872 --> 00:22:44,095
I use that method a lot.

621
00:22:44,408 --> 00:22:45,733
What the hell
am I doing here?

622
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,658
Martin, are you familiar with
a girl named Becca Price?

623
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,405
Uh, yeah.

624
00:22:51,099 --> 00:22:52,965
- We're friends.
- Friends?

625
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:54,520
With an 18-year-old?

626
00:22:54,591 --> 00:22:55,643
<i>How about she found you</i>

627
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:57,779
looking for sex on ClipTalk
a few months ago,

628
00:22:57,827 --> 00:22:59,881
and you've been hooking up
every now and then

629
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:01,995
in exchange for letting her
sleep in your bed.

630
00:23:02,044 --> 00:23:03,218
Look, what is she saying?

631
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:05,268
<i>'Cause I don't know if you know,</i>
but that girl is homeless,

632
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:06,414
<i>unstable.</i>

633
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:07,983
She's probably on drugs or something.

634
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,123
She's dead.

635
00:23:09,171 --> 00:23:10,539
What?

636
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:12,055
I didn't...

637
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,628
That wasn't me.

638
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:15,063
Where were you last night?

639
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:16,541
At home.

640
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:20,243
Look, Becca did come over,

641
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:22,300
but only for a few minutes.

642
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:23,638
I swear.

643
00:23:23,686 --> 00:23:25,139
- What time?
- Eight-ish.

644
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:26,741
It was definitely before 9:00.

645
00:23:27,064 --> 00:23:28,510
That's when my girlfriend got home.

646
00:23:29,334 --> 00:23:30,467
Your girlfriend?

647
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:31,939
Yeah, she travels.

648
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,131
- I get lonely.
- What did Becca want?

649
00:23:34,192 --> 00:23:36,557
A place to sleep, a shower.

650
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:38,615
<i>I told her my girlfriend
was on her way.</i>

651
00:23:38,734 --> 00:23:40,124
Look, Becca threatened to tell on me

652
00:23:40,172 --> 00:23:41,440
if I didn't give her money.

653
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:42,942
All I had was a 20.

654
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,550
After she left,

655
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,828
I realized she stole my Cerus watch.

656
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:48,019
<i>Cost me 10 grand.</i>

657
00:23:48,068 --> 00:23:50,120
<i>And you couldn't file a police report</i>

658
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:52,554
because you would have to
explain what happened

659
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:54,070
to your girlfriend.

660
00:23:55,418 --> 00:23:57,450
Okay. Sit tight.

661
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:00,505
Please, I didn't hurt that girl.

662
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,011
You have to believe me.

663
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:06,014
There was no watch on Becca's body.

664
00:24:06,062 --> 00:24:07,549
Whoever killed her probably took it.

665
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:08,831
Or maybe she sold it.

666
00:24:08,879 --> 00:24:10,118
Tamara might know where.

667
00:24:10,166 --> 00:24:11,177
Good news.

668
00:24:11,225 --> 00:24:13,187
They got inside Jason's laptop

669
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:16,024
and found a very intricate
money-laundering operation.

670
00:24:16,072 --> 00:24:18,026
That's great. Who's he working for?

671
00:24:18,074 --> 00:24:19,231
They can't tell yet.

672
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,696
Jason works a pretty
skilled shell game.

673
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:24,699
<i>But, Financial Crimes
are monitoring the accounts,</i>

674
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:26,091
and if he tries to move any money,

675
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:27,317
- they'll track it.
- He won't.

676
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,706
He knows we have his laptop.

677
00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:29,904
He'll assume you're watching.

678
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,512
Well, he'll have to move
the money eventually.

679
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,408
Whoever he's working for
is gonna expect results.

680
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:34,927
So, what's his next move?

681
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:36,331
I don't know.

682
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:37,545
Yet.

683
00:24:38,677 --> 00:24:39,736
Uh-oh.

684
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:42,251
Looks like your avoidance plan
just hit a speed bump.

685
00:24:43,265 --> 00:24:45,099
Okay, our first official fight.

686
00:24:45,247 --> 00:24:47,489
So, I'll lay out
the way I handle conflict,

687
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:48,656
which is to go right at it.

688
00:24:48,704 --> 00:24:51,568
I asked you to let me handle
the Curtis situation

689
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:53,200
by myself, but you...

690
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,724
- you didn't listen.
- I...

691
00:24:54,772 --> 00:24:56,572
Yeah, you were only there
in case something happened.

692
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,513
I get it, sure.

693
00:24:57,561 --> 00:25:00,264
But that's not the point,
I expressed my desire,

694
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:02,325
and you ignored it,
and that pisses me off.

695
00:25:02,374 --> 00:25:03,660
I mean, if you don't trust me

696
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,208
when I tell you that I
got something handled,

697
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,665
then that's something that
we gotta work out, because,

698
00:25:08,713 --> 00:25:11,050
- if we can't trust each other
- I'm pregnant.

699
00:25:15,653 --> 00:25:17,952
I-I-I can't tell if you're joking.

700
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,060
I'm not.

701
00:25:21,637 --> 00:25:23,024
I just found out.

702
00:25:23,466 --> 00:25:25,370
Harper. Uh, we need to go.

703
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:26,761
My mom just sent a 911 text,

704
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:28,450
and she's not answering her phone.

705
00:25:30,023 --> 00:25:31,283
Alright.

706
00:25:31,518 --> 00:25:33,012
What's up?

707
00:25:38,653 --> 00:25:40,440
I'll call you after my shift.

708
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,422
Becca talked about you all the time.

709
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:48,229
Really?

710
00:25:48,357 --> 00:25:50,737
She was always wondering
what you were up to.

711
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,863
She was so proud.

712
00:25:54,544 --> 00:25:56,224
It was kind of annoying, actually.

713
00:25:56,411 --> 00:25:58,896
I was like, "Damn, why you
so obsessed with Tamara?

714
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:00,215
Stop."

715
00:26:02,678 --> 00:26:03,965
But for real.

716
00:26:04,723 --> 00:26:06,323
We're all proud.

717
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,803
I should've stayed in better touch.

718
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:10,348
I-I'm sorry.

719
00:26:17,217 --> 00:26:19,694
- Look out.
- No. It's okay.

720
00:26:20,062 --> 00:26:21,496
They're cool.

721
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:25,101
Hey.

722
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:27,755
How are you holding up?

723
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,451
It's just a lot.

724
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:31,411
Being back here.

725
00:26:32,434 --> 00:26:34,317
- Did you find out anything?
- Yes, uh...

726
00:26:34,365 --> 00:26:36,083
Lopez interviewed all of the men

727
00:26:36,131 --> 00:26:37,248
that Becca was swiping with.

728
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:38,727
They all have solid alibis.

729
00:26:38,776 --> 00:26:40,616
We did find out that Becca stole a watch
from one of them,

730
00:26:40,664 --> 00:26:41,661
right before she died,

731
00:26:41,709 --> 00:26:43,269
so if we can trace her back there,

732
00:26:43,318 --> 00:26:45,005
we might be able to find out
what happened to her.

733
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:46,810
Do you have any idea
what Becca would have done

734
00:26:46,858 --> 00:26:48,433
with a stolen watch?

735
00:26:49,751 --> 00:26:50,896
Tamara, hey.

736
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:52,606
Uh, it's okay.

737
00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:54,121
There's no judgment here.

738
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,485
Um...

739
00:26:57,268 --> 00:27:00,023
there's a pawn shop we used to go to.

740
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:01,958
Harvey's.

741
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,855
It's just two blocks.

742
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:05,700
Okay, yeah. We'll check it out.

743
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,801
- Are you okay here?
- Yeah.

744
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,496
Yeah. I'm good.

745
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,766
<i>Okay.</i>

746
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:13,341
<i>Alright.</i>

747
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,083
Do you still hear the lambs, Clarice?

748
00:27:21,177 --> 00:27:22,764
Oh, Oscar, you're no Hannibal Lecter.

749
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:24,266
You're more "Ernest Goes to Jail."

750
00:27:24,315 --> 00:27:26,803
Well, you still need my help so, hit me.

751
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:29,568
Jason was laundering money.
We shut it down.

752
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:30,755
The arrest warrant's ready to go.

753
00:27:30,803 --> 00:27:32,084
- We just need to find him.
- Well, okay.

754
00:27:32,132 --> 00:27:33,710
Well, let me think about that.

755
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:37,020
I'm Jason. Right?

756
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:39,092
My back is against the wall.

757
00:27:39,476 --> 00:27:42,091
The people that I launder money
for are pissed...

758
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,268
Right?

759
00:27:43,317 --> 00:27:44,975
Probably want me dead.

760
00:27:45,142 --> 00:27:47,129
And the police are moving in.

761
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:48,349
So...

762
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:50,365
What do I do?

763
00:27:53,043 --> 00:27:54,471
Honestly?

764
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:55,698
It's really simple.

765
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,619
I just turn myself in.

766
00:27:57,908 --> 00:28:00,536
<i>Flip on my employers</i>
<i>and cut a sweet deal.</i>

767
00:28:01,465 --> 00:28:02,685
<i>John?</i>

768
00:28:12,178 --> 00:28:14,466
Well, you tell Ye that I want in,

769
00:28:14,514 --> 00:28:16,130
so he should call me back.

770
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:18,912
Hey.

771
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:20,186
I tried calling you. What's wrong?

772
00:28:20,235 --> 00:28:21,858
Oh, nothing, I...

773
00:28:22,055 --> 00:28:24,795
I just have somebody
I would love for you to meet.

774
00:28:25,046 --> 00:28:26,281
Aaron.

775
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,333
I'm Morris Mackey.

776
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:28,868
I'm the reality TV producer here.

777
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:30,625
It's nice to finally meet you.

778
00:28:31,118 --> 00:28:32,171
You are?

779
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:33,538
Annoyed.

780
00:28:33,597 --> 00:28:34,647
Right.

781
00:28:34,695 --> 00:28:36,109
Uh, I'll make this quick.

782
00:28:36,233 --> 00:28:37,960
I want to change your image.

783
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,342
You've been the villain before,

784
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,585
you've been the victim,

785
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:42,248
but you've never been the hero.

786
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:45,147
Let me make you the
hero of your own story.

787
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:47,424
- That's it.
- Think about it, baby.

788
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,480
So, all parties here are in agreement

789
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:52,558
on the terms of the deal...

790
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:53,904
you, Jason Wyler,

791
00:28:53,952 --> 00:28:55,528
admit to residing in an address

792
00:28:55,577 --> 00:28:57,263
not registered
with your parole officer.

793
00:28:57,311 --> 00:28:59,098
<i>You admit to the crime</i>
<i>of laundering money</i>

794
00:28:59,146 --> 00:29:01,301
for the Southern Front
criminal organization.

795
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:03,551
And you admit to the
crime of planting cocaine

796
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,538
in a vehicle owned by Bailey Nune.

797
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,940
He does.

798
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:11,263
And, I regret all of it.

799
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:12,669
Oh, come on.

800
00:29:12,733 --> 00:29:14,380
<i>In exchange for your cooperation</i>

801
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:16,149
with an investigation
into Southern Front,

802
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,480
we are prepared to offer you

803
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:18,951
a reduced sentence of 18 months.

804
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:20,364
18 months?

805
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:22,732
He nearly ruined my life,
and that's all he gets?

806
00:29:22,781 --> 00:29:24,334
I know. It sucks.

807
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:26,109
But putting a dent in an organization

808
00:29:26,173 --> 00:29:27,568
as evil as the Southern Front

809
00:29:27,616 --> 00:29:29,395
is just far too...

810
00:29:29,697 --> 00:29:31,664
compelling for the DA's office.

811
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:33,099
This isn't gonna stop.

812
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:35,234
The second he gets out,
he'll find me again.

813
00:29:35,282 --> 00:29:36,669
And we'll be ready for him.

814
00:29:36,717 --> 00:29:38,805
<i>I'm gonna be
very clear, Mr. Wyler,</i>

815
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:40,327
so there's no confusion.

816
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:43,676
If you try to pull anything
during the operation,

817
00:29:43,724 --> 00:29:47,146
this deal and any sentiment of leniency

818
00:29:47,194 --> 00:29:48,984
we may be feeling toward you

819
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:50,516
is off the table.

820
00:29:54,702 --> 00:29:56,489
Do you understand?

821
00:29:56,749 --> 00:29:58,136
I understand, sir.

822
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:00,571
And I promise you, you won't see

823
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:02,216
any tricks from me.

824
00:30:06,258 --> 00:30:07,664
<i>Nyla's pregnant?</i>

825
00:30:07,838 --> 00:30:09,110
Yeah.

826
00:30:09,222 --> 00:30:11,068
Congratulations.

827
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:12,717
You guys didn't waste any time.

828
00:30:14,061 --> 00:30:15,219
Oh.

829
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:16,480
It wasn't planned.

830
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:18,342
- Not at all.
- Mm.

831
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:20,037
But. But i-it's great.

832
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,345
Uh-huh.

833
00:30:21,463 --> 00:30:22,897
You don't sound very convincing.

834
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,334
It's just, she told me

835
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:25,710
in the middle of a fight.

836
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:26,747
Oh.

837
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:27,818
Yeah, an argument bomb.

838
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,554
Angela's dropped a few of those on me.

839
00:30:29,603 --> 00:30:30,753
So, how did you respond?

840
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:33,465
I didn't.

841
00:30:34,524 --> 00:30:35,901
She told you she was pregnant,

842
00:30:35,949 --> 00:30:37,035
and you didn't say anything?

843
00:30:37,084 --> 00:30:38,237
At all?

844
00:30:40,578 --> 00:30:42,132
Okay, so, w-w-what should I do?

845
00:30:42,228 --> 00:30:43,544
It's big gesture time.

846
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:45,803
You're gonna have to max your
credit card out on this one.

847
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:48,471
Man.

848
00:30:48,634 --> 00:30:50,374
<i>If you're just joining us...</i>

849
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:53,717
Oh, hello, Officers.

850
00:30:53,765 --> 00:30:55,259
Shopping around?

851
00:30:55,784 --> 00:30:57,795
Let me guess. A Rams fan, am I right?

852
00:30:57,967 --> 00:30:59,451
Hey, I've got a signed copy

853
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:01,140
- of Cooper Kupp's...
- We're looking for a stolen

854
00:31:01,188 --> 00:31:03,287
Ceres watch, worth about 10 grand.

855
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:05,936
So, you come into my shop, accusing me?

856
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:08,717
Of purchasing stolen
property from homeless teenagers?

857
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:10,638
We are accusing you of exactly that.

858
00:31:10,687 --> 00:31:12,808
Oh. So I'm the bad guy?

859
00:31:12,946 --> 00:31:14,989
These kids got nobody
looking out for them.

860
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:16,709
So what if something falls into their
hands

861
00:31:16,757 --> 00:31:18,339
that whoever owned it won't miss?

862
00:31:18,388 --> 00:31:19,919
They're just trying to survive.

863
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,948
I'm a lifeline to these kids.

864
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,861
Were you a lifeline to her?

865
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,330
Oh, man.

866
00:31:26,147 --> 00:31:27,942
- Is she dead?
- Yes.

867
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,961
And the watch could be the reason why.

868
00:31:34,615 --> 00:31:36,131
It was brought in yesterday.

869
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:42,639
The serial number matches.
Becca was here.

870
00:31:42,826 --> 00:31:43,975
No.

871
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:45,899
I bought this off Declan.

872
00:31:47,888 --> 00:31:49,558
Isn't that Tamara's friend?

873
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:53,422
- Are you okay?
- No.

874
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:55,629
I miss her, too,

875
00:31:55,734 --> 00:31:59,241
and I'm so sorry I haven't been around.

876
00:32:02,342 --> 00:32:04,077
She showed me the watch.

877
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,130
Said that she was gonna
pawn it in the morning

878
00:32:06,178 --> 00:32:08,487
and use the cash to go back to school.

879
00:32:09,982 --> 00:32:11,729
Be like you, she said.

880
00:32:12,424 --> 00:32:13,644
Believe that?

881
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:17,393
She was gonna leave me, too.

882
00:32:17,938 --> 00:32:20,967
So, she went to sleep, and...

883
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,649
I tried to sneak the watch out, but,

884
00:32:23,969 --> 00:32:25,817
<i>she woke up, and,</i>

885
00:32:25,865 --> 00:32:27,131
she totally freaked on me,

886
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,779
so I-I pushed her and...

887
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:30,221
And she hit her head,

888
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,625
<i>and there was so much blood.</i>

889
00:32:31,674 --> 00:32:32,998
It-It was an accident.

890
00:32:33,046 --> 00:32:35,089
I swear that I didn't...
- <i>Declan,</i>

891
00:32:35,137 --> 00:32:36,799
show us your hands right now.

892
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,063
Turn around.

893
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:40,955
<i>Interlace your fingers

894
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:44,717

Show us Code 4.

896
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:47,518
Suspect in custody.

897
00:32:48,134 --> 00:32:50,697
- Hey, are you okay?
- No.

898
00:32:56,383 --> 00:32:58,618
<i>So, we have to check
your mic levels.</i>

899
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,154
Can you speak normally for me?

900
00:33:00,526 --> 00:33:02,955
This must be killing you.

901
00:33:03,946 --> 00:33:05,750
Levels are fine.

902
00:33:06,228 --> 00:33:07,928
You talk to Officer Nolan again,

903
00:33:07,977 --> 00:33:09,877
I'll pull your deal. Understood?

904
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:11,856
Yes, sir.

905
00:33:11,977 --> 00:33:14,993
Now, shall we go over the plan
one last time, Mr. Wyler?

906
00:33:15,673 --> 00:33:17,467
I get them to turn over the money,

907
00:33:17,516 --> 00:33:19,330
confirm turnaround
to the usual accounts,

908
00:33:19,378 --> 00:33:21,332
and you guys swoop in.

909
00:33:21,506 --> 00:33:23,077
In addition to hearing every word,

910
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,648
we've set up a surveillance camera

911
00:33:24,697 --> 00:33:26,103
at the exchange point.

912
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:27,447
Anything goes wrong, we'll be in there

913
00:33:27,495 --> 00:33:28,673
quick, fast, and in a hurry.

914
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,592
I have no doubt, Sergeant.

915
00:33:30,684 --> 00:33:32,268
Thank you for this.

916
00:33:46,282 --> 00:33:47,892
You know you don't
have to be here for this.

917
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:49,424
Yes, sir.

918
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,204
Thank you. But I do.

919
00:33:53,493 --> 00:33:55,475
Friendly moving into position.

920
00:33:56,615 --> 00:33:58,369
<i>7-Adam-19, copy.</i>

921
00:34:00,612 --> 00:34:02,873
Okay, you need to get
your head in the game.

922
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:04,901
Look at me, I just found out
I am pregnant,

923
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,409
and yet, I am focused

924
00:34:06,457 --> 00:34:07,682
and ready to go.

925
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:09,563
Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

926
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:12,750
You gonna do the show?

927
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:15,372
I don't know.

928
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:17,502
I-I just feel like it would cheapen
everything I went through.

929
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,627
Then why are you still struggling?

930
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,927
Because I feel like
I'm letting my mom down.

931
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:24,570
And?

932
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:27,014
Because if the show's done right,
then I can

933
00:34:27,062 --> 00:34:28,948
finally control the way people see me.

934
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:30,397
Hmm.

935
00:34:35,588 --> 00:34:36,741
Not a good time, Oscar.

936
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:38,041
Oh, well, then I'll be fast.

937
00:34:38,187 --> 00:34:40,064
Two words... You're welcome.

938
00:34:40,113 --> 00:34:41,474
What am I supposed to be
thanking you for?

939
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:43,581
<i>Well, after doing a little</i>
<i>digging on your boy Jason,</i>

940
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:45,119
<i>I found out he has a side hustle</i>

941
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,708
working with the Southern Front.

942
00:34:46,799 --> 00:34:48,586
The same group of fine young folks

943
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:50,182
that want your pal Oscar dead.

944
00:34:50,242 --> 00:34:52,047
Officer Nolan, the target has arrived.

945
00:34:52,096 --> 00:34:53,394
Sir, we may have a problem.

946
00:34:53,443 --> 00:34:55,192
Oscar, cut to the chase.
What did you do?

947
00:34:55,299 --> 00:34:56,855
Oh, fine. Ruin my story.

948
00:34:56,904 --> 00:34:58,056
Okay, upshot is,

949
00:34:58,104 --> 00:35:00,077
I think I found a solution
to both of our problems.

950
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:01,377
<i>A few minutes ago,</i>

951
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:03,422
<i>I had a little talk with a
Southern Front contact.</i>

952
00:35:03,471 --> 00:35:04,822
<i>I told them your boy Jason</i>

953
00:35:04,871 --> 00:35:06,033
was working with the cops

954
00:35:06,081 --> 00:35:07,718
<i>to rat them out, and in exchange,</i>

955
00:35:07,766 --> 00:35:09,137
<i>they lifted the hit on me,</i>

956
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:10,474
<i>put one out on him.</i>

957
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:11,824
Two birds,

958
00:35:11,872 --> 00:35:13,644
one shiv, huh?

959
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:16,280
All units, the friendly's been made.

960
00:35:16,328 --> 00:35:17,648
Move in.

961
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:25,920
How much we looking at?

962
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:27,861
About two mil.

963
00:35:27,952 --> 00:35:29,539
Same accounts as last time?

964
00:35:36,148 --> 00:35:37,201
What?

965
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,902
Is there a problem?

966
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,747
Yeah. Apparently, it's you.

967
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:45,287
- Okay.
- Police!

968
00:35:53,993 --> 00:35:55,845
Drop your weapons! Now!

969
00:35:57,527 --> 00:35:58,981
Cover me.

970
00:36:14,283 --> 00:36:15,748
Put it down!

971
00:36:15,858 --> 00:36:17,029
On the ground! Right now!

972
00:36:17,077 --> 00:36:18,479
Get down!

973
00:36:18,528 --> 00:36:20,182
<i>Get down, right now! On the ground!</i>

974
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:21,735
Down!

975
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:01,260
Let's go.

976
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,196
You really don't wanna do this.

977
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:04,498
Screw that.

978
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:05,942
If I'm going back,

979
00:37:06,014 --> 00:37:08,246
I want to add "kicking your ass"
to the list of charges.

980
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:13,798
You were saying?

981
00:37:17,399 --> 00:37:19,190
Hey.

982
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:20,815
- I was hoping I'd catch you.
- You know what?

983
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,303
It's been a really long day,
and I'm not sure

984
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:24,048
how much more bad
news I can handle right now.

985
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,746
- What if it's good news?
- Is this a joke?

986
00:37:26,795 --> 00:37:29,313
I convinced my boss
to a cut good deal for Tyler.

987
00:37:29,362 --> 00:37:30,586
Really?

988
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:32,440
He won't be charged as an adult.

989
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,552
He'll serve six months in juvie,

990
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,220
then probation till he turns 18.

991
00:37:36,268 --> 00:37:37,755
That's a good deal.

992
00:37:37,803 --> 00:37:38,971
I know you think I'm a rookie,

993
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:40,635
who doesn't
have the experience to do the job,

994
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:42,137
but you should maybe give me a break.

995
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:44,405
I actually think we're working
toward the same goal.

996
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,620
Just coming at it
from different angles.

997
00:37:46,923 --> 00:37:49,467
Well, um, I appreciate
you making this happen.

998
00:37:49,574 --> 00:37:51,261
I appreciate you convincing me.

999
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:55,048
Good night.

1000
00:37:58,551 --> 00:38:00,121
So, I've been, uh...

1001
00:38:00,169 --> 00:38:01,553
I've been thinking about your offer

1002
00:38:01,601 --> 00:38:02,862
to do the show with me.

1003
00:38:02,962 --> 00:38:05,083
- Really?
- Yeah.

1004
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:06,918
Look, if you can promise me

1005
00:38:06,966 --> 00:38:08,128
that I'll have full control

1006
00:38:08,176 --> 00:38:10,414
over the pieces of my
life that we expose, then...

1007
00:38:10,715 --> 00:38:12,090
Yeah. I'll do it.

1008
00:38:12,722 --> 00:38:13,822
Cut.

1009
00:38:14,052 --> 00:38:16,006
- What's the problem?
- It sounds fake.

1010
00:38:16,054 --> 00:38:17,528
- What does?
- You.

1011
00:38:17,576 --> 00:38:19,385
Listen, if you want people
to watch this show,

1012
00:38:19,434 --> 00:38:20,965
you gotta sound real.

1013
00:38:21,013 --> 00:38:23,468
- You gotta be real.
- Yeah, listen to her, Aaron.

1014
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:24,936
Your mama's the queen of "real."

1015
00:38:25,208 --> 00:38:26,705
Can I get a touch-up?!

1016
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:28,434
Let's get a touch-up.

1017
00:38:32,483 --> 00:38:34,142
<i>You sure I can't
make you something?</i>

1018
00:38:35,828 --> 00:38:37,482
I'm not really hungry.

1019
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:41,949
- Today sucked.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1020
00:38:42,098 --> 00:38:43,885
Big time.

1021
00:38:44,747 --> 00:38:48,840
♪ I'm with you by your side ♪

1022
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,813
- ♪ By your side ♪
- Thank you.

1023
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:53,420
- For...?
- Everything.

1024
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:55,623
For all your help.

1025
00:38:56,016 --> 00:38:57,810
For this bed.

1026
00:38:58,978 --> 00:39:01,233
For getting justice for Becca.

1027
00:39:01,934 --> 00:39:03,474
You did that.

1028
00:39:06,158 --> 00:39:08,575
And thanks for helping me
leave it all behind,

1029
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:10,036
because if it weren't for you,

1030
00:39:10,085 --> 00:39:13,040
I probably would have ended
up like Becca eventually.

1031
00:39:13,523 --> 00:39:16,439
Well, you don't have to
worry about that anymore.

1032
00:39:17,236 --> 00:39:18,896
You're safe.

1033
00:39:21,458 --> 00:39:23,527
Do you wanna talk about
what you went through

1034
00:39:23,576 --> 00:39:25,178
when you were living on the street?

1035
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:27,999
Um, not now, if that's okay.

1036
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:29,605
Yeah, we don't have
to talk about it now.

1037
00:39:29,654 --> 00:39:31,489
You don't have to
talk about it with me.

1038
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,888
You know, but at some point,

1039
00:39:32,944 --> 00:39:35,948
you might wanna talk to someone...

1040
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,376
Before it sneaks up on you.

1041
00:39:40,593 --> 00:39:42,147
I will.

1042
00:39:42,891 --> 00:39:44,151
I promise.

1043
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,211
Okay.

1044
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:48,352
Good night.

1045
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,467
Do you want this open or closed?

1046
00:39:50,736 --> 00:39:52,503
Closed, please.

1047
00:39:52,552 --> 00:39:55,440
- ♪ I'm with you by your side ♪
- Sweet dreams.

1048
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,467
You wanted to talk?

1049
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:04,092
Um, actually,

1050
00:40:04,141 --> 00:40:05,635
I-I was hoping for

1051
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:08,719
more of a do-over. Um...

1052
00:40:09,296 --> 00:40:11,564
I don't like how I handled it

1053
00:40:11,613 --> 00:40:13,478
when you told me you were pregnant.

1054
00:40:13,576 --> 00:40:15,076
Yeah, you didn't handle it.

1055
00:40:15,124 --> 00:40:16,617
You didn't do anything, you just...

1056
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,983
- You just stood there.
- I know.

1057
00:40:19,032 --> 00:40:21,568
Um, I can only plead

1058
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,419
temporary stupidity

1059
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:28,409
and throw myself at your mercy.

1060
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:31,395
Forgive me.

1061
00:40:31,701 --> 00:40:33,097
Get up.

1062
00:40:34,053 --> 00:40:36,748
- So, am I forgiven?
- Yes.

1063
00:40:36,796 --> 00:40:37,902
Yes, get up.

1064
00:40:39,616 --> 00:40:41,128
Look, look, um,

1065
00:40:41,176 --> 00:40:42,507
I'm here, okay?

1066
00:40:42,555 --> 00:40:45,007
I-I'm ready to listen.
I-I'm ready to talk.

1067
00:40:45,605 --> 00:40:47,959
I'm ready to do
whatever it is you need.

1068
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:50,150
I need you to understand something.

1069
00:40:50,765 --> 00:40:52,185
I made my peace,

1070
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:55,686
with not being able to
get pregnant again, and so,

1071
00:40:55,734 --> 00:40:59,090
I never even allowed
myself to fantasize...

1072
00:41:04,303 --> 00:41:06,088
I'm gonna have this baby.

1073
00:41:10,149 --> 00:41:11,833
Well, then, um...

1074
00:41:12,166 --> 00:41:16,616
you and I are going to
make a kick-ass team

1075
00:41:17,401 --> 00:41:19,252
because we're gonna fight every day

1076
00:41:19,301 --> 00:41:20,694
to make sure that this baby

1077
00:41:20,743 --> 00:41:22,735
gets to live in a much better world

1078
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:24,237
than the one that exists right now.

1079
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:26,551
That's a good answer.

1080
00:41:34,566 --> 00:41:35,752
There we go.

1081
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:37,628
The sommelier recommended this red.

1082
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:39,254
Sounds fancy.

1083
00:41:39,303 --> 00:41:40,488
Yeah. Full disclosure,

1084
00:41:40,536 --> 00:41:41,724
it was the guy at the liquor store.

1085
00:41:41,773 --> 00:41:43,373
But he just said
everyone's buying this bottle.

1086
00:41:43,421 --> 00:41:44,635
Thanks.

1087
00:41:44,684 --> 00:41:45,903
A toast.

1088
00:41:46,012 --> 00:41:48,167
To finally being able to exhale.

1089
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,269
Mm. Can we?

1090
00:41:50,317 --> 00:41:51,637
Yes.

1091
00:41:52,394 --> 00:41:55,874
Jason is behind bars for eight years,

1092
00:41:55,922 --> 00:41:57,712
you have a divorce hearing
set for next month,

1093
00:41:57,761 --> 00:41:59,835
and when your future
ex-husband finally gets out,

1094
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,918
- we'll get a restraining order.
- Mm.

1095
00:42:01,967 --> 00:42:04,682
I really appreciate you
helping me through this mess.

1096
00:42:05,077 --> 00:42:06,424
Anytime.

1097
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,894
Though, I confess, I,

1098
00:42:08,942 --> 00:42:11,278
do find myself
wondering if there isn't yet,

1099
00:42:11,326 --> 00:42:13,408
another crazed lunatic of a husband

1100
00:42:13,457 --> 00:42:15,627
from your checkered past
lurking around out there.

1101
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:16,895
There isn't.

1102
00:42:16,943 --> 00:42:18,731
What a relief. Evil twin?

1103
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:20,199
Triplets. Is that a problem?

1104
00:42:21,112 --> 00:42:22,234
Triplets I can work with.
