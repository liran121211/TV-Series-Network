So you think putting
a 16-year-old into juvie

BAILEY:
Let's talk about what's next.

20
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:36,513
Well, it's pretty straightforward.

21
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:38,548
You can go to trial, fight the charges,

22
00:00:38,596 --> 00:00:40,293
or take a plea.

23
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:41,910
And if I fight and lose?

24
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,900
Most likely, you'll do prison time.

25
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:46,570
And if I take a plea?

26
00:00:46,686 --> 00:00:47,842
I feel confident,

27
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,691
that we could get

28
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:51,327
a mandatory treatment program
and probation.

29
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,230
But I would still have
a drug charge on my record,

30
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:55,567
and at minimum,

31
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:57,066
I would be out of the Army Reserve

32
00:00:57,114 --> 00:01:00,637

from the LAFD.

33
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,478
