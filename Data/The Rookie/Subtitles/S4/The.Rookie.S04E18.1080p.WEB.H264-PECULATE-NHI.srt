1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:05,353
Previously on "The Rookie"...

2
00:00:05,396 --> 00:00:07,572
Silas is the eyes and the ears
of the neighborhood.

3
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:09,922
I'm Larry Macer. Everybody
calls me "The Badger" --

4
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:14,666
Washing out at roll call
on your first day?

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,928
That has gotta be
a record.

6
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:17,843
Being a sergeant's aide

7
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:20,455
would make me stand out
come promotion time.

8
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:22,326
What the hell.
Let's do it.

9
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:23,806
I'm pregnant.

10
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,248
Hey.
You're up early.

11
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:33,381
Yeah, since 3:00.

12
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:35,774
Leg cramps, but it gave me
a chance to think,

13
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:38,299
and I have
made a decision.

14
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:39,474
We should get married.

15
00:00:39,517 --> 00:00:40,779
Huh?

16
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:42,085
Yeah,
tomorrow works for me

17
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:43,260
because I'll be at
the court already.

18
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:46,176
Wow, um...efficient.

19
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,787
Uh, what
brought this on?

20
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:51,268
Brett.
At the community center?

21
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,965
What -- What does Brett
have to do with this?

22
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,271
He called me
your baby mama.

23
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:55,751
Ah, hmm.

24
00:00:55,794 --> 00:00:57,187
I'll talk to him.

25
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:58,710
No, 'cause he won't
be the only one.

26
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:01,626
We should just get married.
Problem solved.

27
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,412
What do you think?

28
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:05,543
I'm in.
Yeah?

29
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:07,545
Um, let's get married.

30
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:08,851
Let's get married!

31
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:12,376
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh ♪

32
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,642
♪ I'm gonna win for you
like I know you want me to do ♪

33
00:01:17,686 --> 00:01:19,383
Okay.
Oh, here we go.

34
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:21,168
And where are
my keys?

35
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:22,952
In the key bowl.
I don't have a key bowl.

36
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:24,475
Oh, you bought me
a key bowl!

37
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:26,173
So, when do you think
you'll be back tonight?

38
00:01:26,216 --> 00:01:28,610
Uh, I would guess,
but I'd hate to jinx it.

39
00:01:28,653 --> 00:01:30,612
But definitely
in time for dinner?

40
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:32,788
It's the first time in two weeks
our schedules have aligned.

41
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:34,224
Yes, if I have to
fake my own death,

42
00:01:34,268 --> 00:01:35,965
I'll be home
in time for dinner.
Mm.

43
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:38,620
Good, because
I bought a new dress

44
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:41,840
and new lacy things that
go under the dress,

45
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:43,015
and I can't wait
to show you.

46
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:44,669
You can show me now.

47
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:47,107
Really?
Oh, I gotta go.

48
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,152
Um, you said my keys
were in the key bowl?

49
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:50,458
Yeah, but now
they're in your hands.

50
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:54,026
Clearly distracted by
the lacy undergarment talk.

51
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,506
Good.

52
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,160
Well, not good when you're
on the street with a gun,

53
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:59,989
so think about it
until you get in the truck.

54
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:01,556
Right. Deal.

55
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:02,992
See you tonight.
Bye.

56
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,994
Grey wants Thorsen
to ride with me today.

57
00:02:05,037 --> 00:02:06,387
You're with Nolan.

58
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,519
Well, try not to
miss me too much.

59
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:10,782
Bradford, nice work on
the Stewart case.

60
00:02:10,826 --> 00:02:12,480
I appreciate that, Webb.
Thanks.

61
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:13,959
You're welcome.

62
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:18,529
Uh, wait,
the Scott Stewart case?

63
00:02:18,573 --> 00:02:20,401
The one where I connected
the Valley Glenn job to him

64
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:22,838
and that's what helped us
put all the pieces together?

65
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:24,840
The Scott Stewart
that I put into custody

66
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:26,581
after he punched me
in the face?

67
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:28,757
You're jealous.

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,975
Is that really
why you do this job,

69
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,760
is for high fives
from Webb?

70
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,805
Okay.

71
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:36,286
It would be nice to
have some recognition.

72
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,114
Hey, Webb.
Yeah?

73
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,725
I couldn't have closed
the Stewart case without Chen.

74
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:41,944
You're a legend, Sarge.

75
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:43,293
A leader who gives credit
to the troops.

76
00:02:43,337 --> 00:02:45,208
Feel better?

77
00:02:45,252 --> 00:02:47,950
No. Now they just think that
you're being selfless.

78
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:49,473
Sergeant Bradford?

79
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:51,432
Uh...sir,

80
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:54,086
I can't tell you how excited
I am to ride with you today.

81
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,263
I'm really looking forward to
soaking up whatever tips and --

82
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:57,960
Does Harper like
that ass-kissing?

83
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,962
No, sir.

84
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:01,442
Why do you
think I would?

85
00:03:01,485 --> 00:03:03,183
Set up the shop.

86
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,013
That's not
a good start.

87
00:03:08,057 --> 00:03:10,625
Any advice on riding
with Sergeant Bradford?

88
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:13,715
Uh, yeah, don't let him take all
the credit for your hard work.

89
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,979
Yeah, well, being a rookie,
I'm not sure

90
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:19,808
if that really applies to me,
but, uh, thank you.

91
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,897
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, that's good.

92
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,029
Caradine's thrilled
you're helping him out.

93
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,944
See, between the flu
and hockey injuries,

94
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,294
he's down to
four detectives.

95
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:29,426
Anything to get out of
that duty belt.

96
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,211
I can only imagine.

97
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,560
Everything okay
with your pregnancy?
Mm-hmm.

98
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:34,126
I don't want you pushing
yourself too hard.

99
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,954
Don't be afraid
to ask for help.

100
00:03:35,998 --> 00:03:37,913
Please, I have
nothing to prove.

101
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:39,306
Alright, if you need anything,
let me know.

102
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,612
Alright.

103
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:43,135
I'm so glad
you're here.

104
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:45,616
I have a crazy backlog
of cases.

105
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,531
I'm engaged.
What?

106
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:48,358
Mm-hmm.
Really?!

107
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:50,230
Yes.
When did he propose?

108
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:51,622
Tell me everything!
When's the wedding?

109
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,972
You know what?
The backlog can wait.

110
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:55,235
I say we go
dress shopping.

111
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:56,584
Wait,
where's the ring?

112
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:58,499
Uh, we're doing things
a little out of order.

113
00:03:58,542 --> 00:04:00,283
I proposed to him,
and it's, you know,

114
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:01,763
not really
that kind of wedding.

115
00:04:01,806 --> 00:04:03,808
We're just doing it
at the courthouse.

116
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,114
And James is
cool with that?

117
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:06,333
Yeah.

118
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,248
Okay.

119
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:11,338
What if I threw you
the smallest reception?

120
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:14,297
Tiny. Miniscule.

121
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:17,300
It's not even about
the recognition, you know?

122
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:19,781
Every single case file
has Tim's name on the front,

123
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,609
and I'm the one filing
the supplemental reports,

124
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:24,176
but how am I supposed to take on
more responsibility

125
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,353
if nobody knows
what I'm capable of?

126
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,963
Okay, you make a lot
of good points,

127
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:29,573
and not to get all factual
and everything,

128
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:32,663
but wasn't, uh,
riding with Tim your idea?

129
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:34,970
Yeah, as Sergeant Tim takes on
all the high-profile cases,

130
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,277
which is not nothing.

131
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,191
But now you're
seeing a downside.
Exactly.

132
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:40,889
Well, then just ask Tim
to reassign you.

133
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:42,064
I'm sure
he'll understand.

134
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:44,936
Nolan, this is not
one of those

135
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,069
"help me solve my problem"
situations.

136
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:49,027
This is one of those
"let's talk about

137
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,421
how Tim is the absolute worst"
situations.

138
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:53,336
Right. You want to know
who the worst is?

139
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,207
It's Tim.

140
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:57,079
Sir, I just want to let you know
that I have been

141
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,950
spending my days off
driving the city,

142
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:00,691
learning every street name,
alleyway,

143
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:02,345
and cul-de-sac
in our jurisdiction.

144
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:04,304
Whatever Tim Test
you have for me, I'm ready.

145
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,654
And that's why I won't
be giving you one.

146
00:05:06,697 --> 00:05:08,351
Harper's
a good T.O.,

147
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,744
and you've been on the job
long enough to know

148
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:11,267
where the nearest
safe bathroom is.

149
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,616
Yeah, Barry's Juice Bar.
It's two blocks east --

150
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,097
So today won't be about
assessing whether or not

151
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,925
you'll pass
the FTO program.

152
00:05:16,968 --> 00:05:18,143
It'll be about
determining

153
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:20,320
what sort of officer
you'll be once you do.

154
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,930
Okay, and how do
we do that?

155
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:24,585
By figuring out
your superpower.

156
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:26,326
Every cop has one.

157
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:29,329
You know, Harper's a chameleon,
nerves of steel.

158
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:32,201
Chen's empathy allows her to
adapt to any situation.

159
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:34,377
And Nolan...

160
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,945
Uh, he talks a lot.
Yeah.

161
00:05:36,988 --> 00:05:40,905
Okay, so what if a cop doesn't
have a superpower?

162
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:41,950
They grow up
to be Smitty.

163
00:05:43,734 --> 00:05:45,780
Still kind of
feels like a test.

164
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:47,477
Congratulations.

165
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,000
I knew you guys would
eventually get married.

166
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:51,742
Yeah,
I-I couldn't be happier.

167
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:52,874
Why are you lying?

168
00:05:52,917 --> 00:05:54,528
Sorry, that was
inappropriate.

169
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,051
No, no, you know what?
You're right.

170
00:05:56,094 --> 00:05:58,358
Uh
it's just,

171
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,751
I-I panicked when she said
we should get married.

172
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:01,883
'Cause you didn't
say anything

173
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,101
when she told you
she was pregnant.

174
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:04,494
Exactly, and I didn't want
to freeze again,

175
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:05,930
so I just said yes.

176
00:06:05,974 --> 00:06:07,497
And now
you're rethinking it?

177
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,283
I mean, I'm totally
in love with her.

178
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:14,156
I just don't know if avoiding
being called "baby mama"

179
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,940
is reason enough
to get married.

180
00:06:15,984 --> 00:06:18,203
On top of the fact,
she stole my thunder.

181
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:19,944
So you want to
marry her?
100%.

182
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:22,947
It's just, I think we should get
married for the right reasons,

183
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:25,428
and...I wanted to be the one
to propose.

184
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:29,040
But enough about my drama.

185
00:06:29,084 --> 00:06:30,955
What's -- What's -- What's next
on the list?

186
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:32,609
Mrs. Parker,
down the street.

187
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,742
Her court date
moved to next Tuesday.

188
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:36,396
And what's the case
against her?

189
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:39,311
She got pulled over last month
for a broken taillight.

190
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:43,228
Somehow ended up in custody for
obstructing an officer's duty,

191
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:44,839
so we're helping walk her
through the system,

192
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:45,666
if you can take her.

193
00:06:45,709 --> 00:06:47,494
Yeah, absolutely.

194
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,147
Cops get
car stop training.

195
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,584
The public's just expected
to figure it out.

196
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:53,282
Yeah, and with Black drivers,
it's like a minefield

197
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:55,632
where the wrong move
leads to police escalation.

198
00:06:55,676 --> 00:06:57,721
Hmm.
I can donate some time.

199
00:06:57,765 --> 00:06:59,462
We can hold some classes.
That's a bad idea.

200
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:00,985
Well, I don't
know about bad.

201
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,596
Well, who's gonna
have time for that?

202
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,467
You want to get the message out,
you got to take it to them.

203
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:05,729
Make a video.

204
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:08,515
Then they could watch
whenever they want.

205
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:10,604
I'm president of
my school's film club.

206
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:12,127
I could direct it.

207
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,304
Well, okay.
Sounds like a plan.

208
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:17,872
Great. I got to warn you guys,
though -- I'm an auteur.

209
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,224
What's the move,
Boot?

210
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:24,052
Well,
car came back clean.

211
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:27,708
No outstanding warrants
and not reported stolen,

212
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:30,101
which either means a brand-new
million-dollar car

213
00:07:30,145 --> 00:07:31,755
just broke down
in K-Town...Or?

214
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:34,105
The real owner's on
his yacht in Saint-Tropez

215
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,499

how to double clutch.

216
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:39,241
Let's find out.
You're contact, I'm cover.

all right, sir?

218

Oh, yeah.
Just, uh --

you know.

220
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:50,818
Oh, okay.

221
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:52,254
Yeah, you know, you'd think
for the price tag,

222
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:53,473
this thing could
fix itself, right?

223
00:07:55,126 --> 00:07:58,521
Yeah, well, uh, usually,
she drives like a dream,

224

these -- these foreign cars

Swiss watches.

226
00:08:02,046 --> 00:08:03,526
You get, like,
a grain of sand in there,

227
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,006
it just gums up
the works.

228
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:05,963
Yeah, yeah.
I've heard that.

Uh, let me
ask you something.

Um, did you go to Rome
for the full factory tour,

231
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,230
or did you pick up
a floor model from Chuck

232
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,971
down at
Beverly Hills Imports?

233
00:08:14,015 --> 00:08:16,496

Right, yeah.

before.

422

You know, like, how was
I supposed to know

that was
a practice dummy?

It was blue.

425
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:42,115
Okay, so, uh, I sent
a photo of the sword

426
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:43,464
to my bladesmith
to see if it's his --

427
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:46,554
You have a bladesmith?
Well, I mean, like, I had.

428
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,948
In high school, I was, like,
really into manga,

429
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,862
so, like, he made me, like,
a few custom pieces,

430
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,168
and he's, like,
the number-one guy in L.A.

431
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:54,910
And, uh, he does weapons
for movies, TV shows --

432
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,912
I don't care.
Get to the point.

433
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,349
Okay, so not only
did he make the sword,

434
00:15:59,393 --> 00:16:01,569

of the woman who bought it.

00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:17,591
No one should be judged
on their worst moment.

520
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:20,289
I'm actually impressed how
you've managed to overcome it.

521
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,986
Thank you.

522
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,902
You two are
a pair of mean girls.

523
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,556
Who are trying
to solve a murder.

524
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,384
So quit worrying about
the choo-choo train cop

525
00:19:28,428 --> 00:19:29,907
and let's get to work.

526
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:32,649
I just got the forensics report
about the broken vase.

527
00:19:32,693 --> 00:19:35,217
No prints, and when they tried
to put it back together,

528
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:37,480
they found
it's missing a piece.

529
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:41,136
So whoever murdered Brian took
a piece from that vase, but why?

530
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,965
What's so significant about
a piece from that vase?

531
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:45,749
Maybe this
will speak to that.

532
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,621
Bloomfield had
three children.

533
00:19:47,664 --> 00:19:49,057
The oldest went to court

534
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,233
to exclude 10 items
from the auction.

535
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,496
Let me guess.
The vase, or "vahse,"

536
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,237
is one of the items
that he contested?

537
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:56,978
We need to talk to
the Bloomfield children.

538
00:19:57,021 --> 00:19:58,588
Maybe one of them
can explain

539
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:01,722
why a shard of pottery
is worth killing for.

540
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:02,940
Francis Bloomfield,

541
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:05,073
you're William Bloomfield's
oldest son.

542
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:08,816
Danielle Bloomfield.
Uh, middle child?

543
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,210
Mm. Does it always
smell like this in here?

544
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:14,256
Thackeray.
You're the baby in the family.

545
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,040
Yeah,
save the best for last.

546
00:20:16,084 --> 00:20:18,826
Can you tell us about
the list of items

547
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:22,351
you petitioned the court
to keep out of the auction?

548
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:25,833
Just a few things
of sentimental value.

549
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,965
Tell us about
this vase.

550
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:31,012
My mom bought that
in Italy.

551
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:33,101
It was on our
first holiday as a family.

552
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:34,972
Such great memories.

553
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,192
Wait, my brother tried to get
the vase back in court?

554
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,280
So you didn't know?

555
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,760
That duplicitous weasel.

556
00:20:39,803 --> 00:20:42,023
Is there some sort of
significance to this vase?

557
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,373
No. It just has great
sentimental value.

558
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:46,506
Listen,
there must be a reason

559
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:49,160
your father told his cellmate
about the vase.

560
00:20:49,204 --> 00:20:52,207
I'm sorry, my dad's cellmate
stole the vase?

561
00:20:53,556 --> 00:20:55,689
That conniving
old goat.

562
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:57,473
I hope he rots
in prison.

563
00:20:57,517 --> 00:20:59,910
You hope your father
rots in prison?
Hell yeah.

564
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:02,348
Can you think of any reason why
someone would want to steal it?

565
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:04,959
None at all.
Now may I go?

566
00:21:05,002 --> 00:21:06,569
Do you know why someone
would kill for it?

567
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:07,744
I'd like to leave now.

568
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:09,703
Your dad must have told
his cellmate

569
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,574
about the vase,
but why?

570
00:21:11,618 --> 00:21:13,054
What -- What's
so important?

571
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:15,274
Why don't you ask him?
I'm out of here.

572
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:19,147
Wow.

573
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:21,410
What a bunch of
awful people.

574
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:23,107
Yeah, who are
clearly lying to us.

575
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:24,761
And to each other,
apparently.

576
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:25,980
We need to
talk to the dad.

577
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:27,677
He's at the center
of all of this.

578
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:29,636
Harper and I have an
appointment at the
prison in the morning.

579
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,377
In the meanwhile,
I'll have midnight shift

580
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,335
start digging into
all their lives.

581
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,685
Hey, so, I think I know
what my superpower is.

582
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,208
It's my powers
of deduction.

583
00:21:37,252 --> 00:21:38,775
Really?

584
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:40,386
Yeah, I mean,
the -- the car thief,

585
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:41,952
the sword.

586
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,693
I mean, you gotta admit
I rocked those cases.

587
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:46,217
You cracked those cases
by being rich.

588
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:48,307
Your friends are the only
Lamborghini dealer in the city.

589
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,525
You have a swordsmith.

590
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,353
Bladesmith.

591
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:53,355
He also forges
daggers and knives.

592
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,531
Face it,
your superpower is money.

593
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:58,534
You're like Batman,
except last I checked,

594
00:21:58,578 --> 00:21:59,970
you weren't trying
to be a superhero.

595
00:22:00,014 --> 00:22:01,624
So, uh, we'll see you tomorrow
at the station?

596
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:03,931
Hopefully.
Why "hopefully"?

597
00:22:03,974 --> 00:22:07,413
It's gonna take all my skills
to make this footage watchable.

598
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:08,936
I'm gonna be at it all night.

599
00:22:08,979 --> 00:22:11,286
I'm sure you're
going to make it great.

600
00:22:14,202 --> 00:22:15,812
You headed home, too?

601
00:22:15,856 --> 00:22:19,120
Yeah.
I have to talk to Nyla.

602
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:21,296
I just don't want her
to feel rejected.

603
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,081
She proposed, you said yes,
and now you're pressing pause.

604
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:25,822
She might feel rejected.

605
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:28,477
I love her, and I don't want
to screw this up.

606
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:29,826
You won't, trust me.

607
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:33,352
Actually, you might.
It's probably 50-50.

608
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,180
You know, you're really bad
at encouragement.

609
00:22:36,224 --> 00:22:37,878
I know. I'm working on it.
See you tomorrow.

610
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,967
Alright.

611
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,708
Thank you very much.

612
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,493
That dinner was
amazing.

613
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,147
And...?

614
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,455
And it was delicious?

615
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:50,543
My dress?

616
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:52,196
Oh, this is
the new dress?

617
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,850
You didn't notice.
It's -- No,

618
00:22:53,894 --> 00:22:56,244
it just looks a little -- little
like some of your other dresses.

619
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:59,378
Well, I have one in ballet pink,
but this is dusty rose.

620
00:22:59,421 --> 00:23:01,597
Oh, and those are
two very different colors.

621
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,730
Listen, if you don't like it,
I can take it off.

622
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:05,949
In that case,
I hate it.

623
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:10,171
I will
take care of that.

624
00:23:10,214 --> 00:23:11,868
Stay right there.

625
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:15,959
Hey.
Larry,
what are you doing here?

626
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,526
Sorry to just
stop by so late.

627
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,745
Is everything okay?
Kenny okay?

628
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:20,703
Kenny -- Yes.
Kenny's fine.

629
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:22,357
Uh, hey, how are you?

630
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,054
We met this morning.
Larry Macer.

631
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:26,492
I remember, and I'm glad
your partner's okay.

632
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:28,145
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah.Thank you
for the update.

633
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:28,885
That's been --
No, no, no.

634
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:30,017
I-I figured it out.

635
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,236
Why -- Why this vase
is so important.

636
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,238
You sent the files
over on the vase and
I was looking at them,

637
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:36,240
and I-I noticed that there's
a piece missing, right?

638
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:37,981
So I pulled up all these
pictures of the vase.

639
00:23:38,025 --> 00:23:39,069
Look at that.
Right on the rim.

640
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:40,723
Numbers.

641
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:42,812
Numbers, yeah, but why?
Why numbers on a vase?

642
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:45,249
There's been talk
that William Bloomfield

643
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:47,338
tried to hide some of
the money that he stole.

644
00:23:47,382 --> 00:23:51,342
I think these numbers are for
offshore bank accounts.

645
00:23:53,562 --> 00:23:55,608
I'm back here.

646
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:57,566
Hey.

647
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,524
Long day?

648
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:00,351
Yeah, the longest.

649
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:03,354
How is my fiancé?

650
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:06,488
Can we talk?

651
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:09,448
Yeah, of course.

652
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:14,017
I love that you proposed
to me this morning.

653
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:18,108
And I'd be a fool if I didn't
want to be your husband.

654
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:20,110
Mm.

655
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:23,853
But I want you to make sure
it's what you want.

656
00:24:23,897 --> 00:24:25,768
I just don't want to be
your regret --

657
00:24:25,812 --> 00:24:27,553
you know, the guy that
you had to marry.

658
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:30,860
I want you to be
100% sure.

659
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:34,385
Well, I mean, what --I need you to really,
really think about this.

660
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:38,477
I'm gonna spend the night
at my place, and...

661
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,523
we'll talk tomorrow.

662
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:42,872
I love you.

663
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:51,664
♪♪

664
00:24:54,884 --> 00:24:57,321
Come on, this so exciting.
It's like we're partners.

665
00:24:57,365 --> 00:24:59,062
You know? I'm like the --
the Starsky to your Hutch,

666
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:01,543
the Tango to your Cash,
the Ten speed to your Brown Shoe.

667
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:04,328
My brown what?
Oh, uh, deep cut, sorry.

668
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:06,635
I'm older.
Hey, Larry's back.

669
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:08,550
Hey.
Why is Larry back?

670
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:10,117
Larry
made a breakthrough.

671
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,292
He'll be working
the case with us.

672
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:13,250
I should've
brought my Kev--

673
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:15,862
Great.
Uh, what'd you find?

674
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:19,256
The missing piece to
William Bloomfield's vase,

675
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,476
it had some numbers
and letters etched into it.

676
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,957
And I identified it
as IBAN from my IT days.

677
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,219
IBAN?

678
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:26,873
International
Bank Account Number.

679
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:27,961
Yeah, it's a way to
identify bank accounts

680
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:29,223
across national borders.

681
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:31,834
So, you see the first two,
uh, letters here?

682
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:34,315
That's the country code, and
then you got the check digits,

683
00:25:34,358 --> 00:25:36,317
and the rest is basically,
uh, a bank account number.

684
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,624
And the first two letters
were "C" and "H."

685
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,626
Which you can see is
Switzerland.

686
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:44,281
O-Okay, so Bloomfield knew
the feds were closing in on him

687
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:46,327
and that they'd seize
all of his assets.

688
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:48,677
Right. So he squirreled away
a little money offshore

689
00:25:48,721 --> 00:25:49,939
before he got
sent to prison.

690
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:51,506
And he etched it onto
the top of the vase

691
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,942
so no one could find it.

692
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:54,596
But Bloomfield knew that
he had to get the vase back

693
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,945
before it was sold,

694
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:58,121
so he had his cellmate,
Brian Shab,

695
00:25:58,165 --> 00:25:59,340
go steal it.

696
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:01,255
I'm gonna grab Lopez
and head to the prison.

697
00:26:01,298 --> 00:26:03,866
Whoever killed Shab knew
about the account numbers.

698
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,260
We need Bloomfield to give us
the names of everyone he told.

699
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:07,653
Alright.

700
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:09,089

as long as justice is served,

who -- who cares
who gets the credit?

706
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:23,886
Mm-hmm.

707
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,409

you know what?

I have skills
beyond my parents' wealth.

For example,
nothing fazes me.

711
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:32,634
Your first day,

she wasn't in Paris
on the day of the murder.

One of them

They sent me here.

They're gonna get that money

Not if they only
have the vase.

about. I want to see my son.

differently than this, right?

Yeah.
But you gotta remember,

802
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:36,905
I mean, they've been out here
living their lives,

803
00:29:36,949 --> 00:29:38,820
and they might not be ready
right now,

804
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,169
but you
give it some time,

805
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:41,562
and maybe one day
they will be, okay?

806
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:44,695
Look.

807
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,436
