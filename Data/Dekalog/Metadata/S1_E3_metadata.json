It's Christmas Eve, and he honours the (Polish) traditions for this (holy) day: he gives presents to the members of his family and attends Midnight Mass. Later, Ewa, a woman who he had betrayed his wife with three years earlier, asks him to help her. Her husband is missing, and she asks him to help her search for him. Should Janusz stay home to keep the day holy? Or should he help Ewa, who says she needs his help, to keep the day holy? Is it his duty to help her? This episode seems to be both about the third commandment and about some of the other commandments, for example \"Thou shalt not commit adultery\" and \"Thou shalt not lie\".\u2014sonnyschlaegel"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0094985", "rating": 7.4, "votes": 4948, "number_of_episodes": 10}
