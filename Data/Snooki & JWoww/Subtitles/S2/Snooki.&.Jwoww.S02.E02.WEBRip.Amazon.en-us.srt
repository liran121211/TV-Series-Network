1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,039
- YOU GOT ME A BEAR?
- IT'’LL FIT NICE DOWNSTAIRS.

2
00:00:05,039 --> 00:00:07,835
- SO, THERE'’S LEGIT, LIKE,
A MILLION PRESENTS RIGHT NOW

3
00:00:07,835 --> 00:00:09,216
THAT I HAVE TO OPEN.

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,976
AND I'’M SO EXCITED...

5
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:13,013
BUT HOLY [bleep],
THERE'’S A LOT OF PRESENTS.

6
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,600
- YOU'’RE PISSING ME OFF,
ROGER.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,362
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
IT WAS A JOKE, RELAX.

8
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:19,191
- YOU'’RE BEING OBNOXIOUS.
- DON'’T PISS ME OFF.

9
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:20,986
- SHUT UP!

10
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:22,263
- BOTH PARTIES JUST NEED
TO SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

11
00:00:22,263 --> 00:00:23,575
- I GOT TO GO.

12
00:00:23,575 --> 00:00:25,784
- I'’M NOT APOLOGIZING.

13
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:27,234
- MY BODY'’S STARTING
TO SHUT DOWN.

14
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:29,201
I'’M GETTING SICK.
I'’M NUMB.

15
00:00:29,201 --> 00:00:30,892
I DON'’T KNOW
WHAT THE HECK'’S GOING ON.

16
00:00:30,892 --> 00:00:32,515
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS THIS BABY SHOWER

17
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:34,034
GOING RIGHT FOR NICOLE,

18
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,414
AND ME BEING SICK RIGHT NOW

19
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:38,107
IS BY FAR THE WORST THING
THAT COULD HAPPEN.

20
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:40,661
HEY, WHAT'’S UP?
- WHERE ARE YOU?

21
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:42,559
- IN THE HOSPITAL.

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,148
- ♪ I DON'’T CARE ♪

23
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:46,701

- BABE!
- YEAH.

31
00:01:00,232 --> 00:01:04,029
- WHAT'’S WRONG?
- GETTING AN IV NOW.

32
00:01:04,029 --> 00:01:05,548
- YOU'’RE GETTING IVs?

33
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:07,688
- IT WAS FROM JUST
BEING DEHYDRATED,

34
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:08,689
BEING OUT IN THE SUN.

35
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,139
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

36
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:11,830
- I WAS LITERALLY
THROWING UP

37
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,418
TO THE SECOND I GOT HERE

38
00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:14,902
- HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA
STAY THERE?

39
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:17,732
- I DON'’T KNOW.

40
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:18,699
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DON'’T KNOW?

41
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:20,390
- I JUST GOT HERE.

42
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,530
- ARE YOU GONNA COME HOME
TONIGHT?

43
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,876
- I DON'’T KNOW.

44
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,637
- EW.
I'’M GOING THERE.

45
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:27,777
KIND OF FREAKING OUT.
LIKE, I WANT TO CRY.

46
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:29,227
BUT I DON'’T WANT TO CRY
IN FRONT OF JANICE.

47
00:01:29,227 --> 00:01:31,505
I HONESTLY DON'’T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD DO

48
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:33,093
IF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED
TO JIONNI.

49
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,094
I LOVE HIM.

50
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,233
CAN WE GO SEE HIM?

51
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:36,337
- NO, YOU'’RE NOT GOING
DOWN THERE.

52
00:01:36,337 --> 00:01:37,649
- WHY?
- HE'’LL BE FINE.

53
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:38,857
YOU JUST GO HOME AND REST

54
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:40,169
AND I'’LL FIND OUT
WHAT'’S GOING ON.

55
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:42,930
- I'’M NOT GOING
TO BE ABLE TO REST.

56
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:44,932
- LAST NIGHT WAS
A [bleep] [bleep] SHOW.

57
00:01:44,932 --> 00:01:48,556
I'’VE NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH
ANY OF YOUR BOYFRIENDS, EVER.

58
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:50,317
- THIS WOULD BE MY FUTURE
HUSBAND, HOPEFULLY.

59
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:53,009
- WELL, THEN HE NEEDS TO--

60
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,632
I'’M YOUR BEST FRIEND.
HE NEEDS TO RESPECT THAT TOO.

61
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:58,325
- WELL--
- WHATEVER. END OF STORY.

62
00:01:58,325 --> 00:01:59,809
END OF CONVERSATION.

63
00:01:59,809 --> 00:02:03,226
- I FEEL LIKE IF ME AND EUNICE
DON'’T WORK THIS OUT,

64
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:04,262
THAT I'’M GOING
TO PROBABLY END UP

65
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:05,504
DISTANCING MYSELF FROM HER,

66
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:07,196
BECAUSE I'’M NOT GOING
TO TOLERATE

67
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:08,887
HOW SHE'’S ACTING
TOWARDS MY BOYFRIEND.

68
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:11,786
[burps]

69
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:14,686
OH, GOD, THAT SMELLS
LIKE PENNE ALLA VODKA.

70
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:16,446
- OKAY?
- I'’LL GO GET HIM.

71
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:18,034
- YOU'’RE NOT GOING TO GET HIM.
- WHY?

72
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:19,829
- BECAUSE YOU'’RE NOT.
HE'’LL BE FINE.

73
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:21,141
HE'’LL BE FINE.

74
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,659
HE ALWAYS DOES THAT.

75
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,627
YOU REST.
GET YOUR FEET UP.

76
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:26,249
- '’CAUSE HE NEVER
DRINKS WATER, EVER.

77
00:02:26,249 --> 00:02:28,320
- I'’VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION
WITH HIM FOREVER.

78
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,150
HE'’LL BE FINE.
DON'’T WORRY ABOUT IT.

79
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,634
- I DON'’T CARE
IF I'’M EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT,

80
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,394
I'’M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL

81
00:02:33,394 --> 00:02:34,809
AND I'’M GOING TO SLEEP
WITH JIONNI,

82
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:36,294
BECAUSE HE NEEDS ME,
I NEED HIM,

83
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:37,812
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
HE'’S OKAY.

84
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:44,957
- ♪ YOU AND ME ONLY ♪

85
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:46,269
- WHOA!

86
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:47,650
- HEY.
- HI.

87
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,892
- YOU LOOK COMFY.

88
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:50,170
- LAST NIGHT,
THERE WAS A BIG ARGUMENT

89
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,516
BETWEEN ROGER AND EUNICE,

90
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:53,173
BUT I'’M JUST HAPPY
HE'’S FINALLY HOME,

91
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,484
'’CAUSE I HATE
THAT HE HAS TO FEEL

92
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:55,934
LIKE HE HAS TO LEAVE
HIS OWN HOUSE,

93
00:02:55,934 --> 00:02:57,315
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES
TO ONE OF MY FRIENDS.

94
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:58,937
THAT'’S PRETTY [bleep] UP.

95
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:01,836
- WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU REMEMBER
FROM LAST NIGHT?

96
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,907
'’CAUSE MY INTERPRETATION
OF IT--

97
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:05,219
AND I COULD BE WRONG--
WAS, I THINK,

98
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,358
EUNICE HAD A LITTLE
TOO MUCH TO DRINK,

99
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:07,842
WHICH IS ALWAYS THE CASE,

100
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:09,706
AND SHE GOT INCENSED
ABOUT SOMETHING,

101
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:11,363
AND THEN STARTED LIKE--

102
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:13,848
- I THINK WHAT I HEARD
FROM THE GROUP WAS

103
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:16,126
YOU MADE A FUNNY JOKE
THAT SHE DIDN'’T GET.

104
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:17,611
- RIGHT.
- EVERYONE ELSE GOT.

105
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,406
- THAT'’S WHAT I HEARD HER SAY--
I LOOKED UP,

106
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:20,924
AND SHE LOOKS ME
RIGHT IN THE FACE AND SAYS,

107
00:03:20,924 --> 00:03:22,754
"YOU'’VE CHANGED.
YOU USED TO BE A NICE GUY.

108
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:24,238
YOU'’RE AN ASS[bleep] NOW."

109
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,033
- I THINK IT'’S SHE DIDN'’T
REALIZE YOUR JOKE.

110
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:28,173
- YOU KNOW, IF IT
WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT,

111
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:29,554
MAYBE THE NEXT DAY,
EUNICE AND I

112
00:03:29,554 --> 00:03:31,003
COULD'’VE CALLED EACH OTHER
OR GOT TOGETHER

113
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,557
AND SAID, "HEY, LISTEN,
WE WERE BOTH DRINKING.

114
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:33,937
IT GOT A LITTLE OUT OF HAND.
I'’M SORRY."

115
00:03:33,937 --> 00:03:35,076
IT WASN'’T
AN ISOLATED INCIDENT.

116
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:36,595
THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE.

117
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:38,183
NO, I WASN'’T
EVEN MAD AT YOU.

118
00:03:38,183 --> 00:03:40,081
YOU TOLD HER TO SHUT UP.
YOU TOLD ME TO SHUT UP.

119
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:42,843
SO AT LEAST
YOU WERE UNBIASED ABOUT IT,

120
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:45,501
BUT IT WAS GOING TO GET WORSE,
SO I JUST SAID,

121
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:46,847
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
SEE YOU LATER."

122
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:49,608
I DON'’T CARE
IF I EVER TALK TO HER AGAIN.

123
00:03:49,608 --> 00:03:51,369
SHE CAN DO WHATEVER
SHE WANTS TO DO, YOU KNOW?

124
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,198
- I'’M JUST GOING TO DISTANCE
MYSELF FROM HER FOR AWHILE.

125
00:03:53,198 --> 00:03:54,303
- NO!

126
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:56,236
- I AM PRETTY [bleep]
DISAPPOINTED

127
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,168
BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND
WAS BEING A BITCH.

128
00:03:58,168 --> 00:04:00,205
SHE WAS TOO DRUNK TO COMPREHEND
ANYTHING THAT NIGHT,

129
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:02,311
SO SHE SHOULD
JUST LET IT GO.

130
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:06,349
SHE WANTS TO PLAY THAT GAME
OF BEST FRIEND VERSUS BOYFRIEND,

131
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,282
SHE'’LL LOSE, REAL QUICK.

132
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,422
- I DON'’T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE
SUPER TIGHT WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

133
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:13,183
I WOULD BE FINE WITH IT
IF YOU DIDN'’T, REALLY, YOU KNOW,

134
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:14,668
GET ALONG GREAT
WITH ONE OF MY FRIENDS.

135
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:16,532
IT'’S FINE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

136
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:18,085
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
WHATEVER.

137
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:20,639
LET'’S NOT EVEN TALK
ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

138
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,538
- ALL RIGHT, I'’M TIRED.
I NEED TO GO TO BED.

139
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,507
- ♪ WAKE UP EARLY

KNOWING THAT
EVERYTHING'’S OKAY

144
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,863
AND HE'’S GOING TO BE FINE,

145
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:40,728
I'’M VERY HAPPY, YOU KNOW,
THAT NOTHING BAD HAPPENED,

146
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:42,868
AND RIGHT NOW I JUST WANT ME
AND JIONNI TO REST

147
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:44,974
BECAUSE
WE HAD A [bleep] NIGHT.

148

TONIGHT SHOWED ME

151
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,672
HOW STRONG WE ARE,
HOW MUCH SHE LOVES ME.

152
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:56,399
- BUT YOU MADE ME MORE WORRIED
BY NOT TELLING ME.

153
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,988
- I WAS AFRAID TO RUIN THE DAY.
- I DON'’T CARE.

154
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:00,886
- WELL, I DIDN'’T WANT
TO STRESS YOU OUT.

155
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:03,648
- I'’D RATHER KNOW
THAT YOU'’RE OKAY THAN A SHOWER.

156
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:04,925
- I DIDN'’T WANT
TO STRESS YOU OUT.

157
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:06,236
- WELL, YOU DID.

158
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,824
- I DIDN'’T WANT TO RUIN
YOUR DAY, AND I'’M SORRY.

159
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:10,275
- YOU DIDN'’T.
- GOOD.

160
00:05:10,275 --> 00:05:12,795
ALL I CARED ABOUT WAS YOU.

161
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:15,591
THREW UP, I THINK,
48 TIMES.

162
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:18,110
I'’M NOT EXAGGERATING.

163
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,700
- IT'’S NOT THE PROPOSAL
THAT I ACTUALLY WANT,

164
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,323
OR THE ENGAGEMENT.

165
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,842
IT'’S THE RING THAT I WANT.
- [laughs]

166
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:27,223
- DO I LOOK LIKE A DAD?

167
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:28,673
- YEAH, YOU DO.

168
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:30,330
A HOT DAD.

169
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,917
YOU'’RE A D.I.L.F.

170
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,436
- MY MOM'’S HERE.

171
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:43,308
- BIG TRUCK IS GONNA COME
WITH ALL LORENZO'’S PRESENTS.

172
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:47,933
- HEY, WHAT'’S UP?
- HI, ANDY!

173
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:50,350
I'’M UPSTAIRS.
COME UP HERE FOR A MINUTE.

174
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,041
- WHAT'’S GOING ON?
HOW ARE YOU?

175
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,629
- THIS IS THE SPARE ROOM.

176
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:56,010
IN CASE THEY DON'’T WANT
THEIR KID FOR THE NIGHT.

177
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,357
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?

178
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,669
- GOOD.
- IT'’S THE SAFARI ROOM.

179
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:01,222
- WHERE'’S NICOLE?

180
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,603
- THEY'’RE DOWNSTAIRS.

181
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:03,811
- THEY'’RE IN BED?

182
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:05,468
- YEAH.
- THEY'’RE SLEEPING?

183
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:07,090
- YEAH.

184
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,506
- THEY OUGHT TO GET
THEIR TAILS UP, MAN.

185
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,784
- ALL RIGHT, LET'’S GO SEE
WHAT THEY'’RE DOING.

186
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:12,579
OH, MY GOODNESS.

187
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:15,961
NIC...

188
00:06:15,961 --> 00:06:18,136
YOUR DAD IS HERE.
I NEED TO MOVE YOUR CAR.

189
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:20,794
WHERE ARE YOUR KEYS?

190
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:23,141
DID IT ALL FIT?
- IT'’S FULL.

191
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:25,108
- OH, MY GOD.
- COMPLETELY FULL.

192
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:27,145
- HOLY CRAP!

193
00:06:28,457 --> 00:06:29,734
- GOT IT?

194
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:33,565
- THERE'’S NO ROOM.

195
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:34,877
- IS THAT IT?

196
00:06:34,877 --> 00:06:36,637
- ISN'’T THAT ENOUGH?

197
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,260
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

198
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,987
- JOE.
I'’LL SEE YOU.

199
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:48,304
- WILL YOU GUYS
COME UP AND EAT?

200
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:49,616
PLEASE?

201
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:51,583
BURGERS.

202
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,551
- I THINK IT'’S SWEET THAT JANICE
CARES ABOUT US SO MUCH

203
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:55,345
THAT SHE ALWAYS WANTS
TO TAKE CARE OF US.

204
00:06:55,345 --> 00:06:56,657
I LIKE IT.

205
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:58,418
MY DAD CAME?

206
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,420
- I ASKED YOUR DAD TO STAY.

207
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,180
I FELT BAD, HE HAD--

208
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,837
- HE SAID HE HAD
A LOT OF THINGS TO DO.

209
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:05,390
- THE TRUCK WAS--
- HE'’S A BUSY MAN.

210
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,875
- THE TRUCK WAS REALLY PACKED.

211
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:10,568
- LIKE A BIG U-HAUL?
- YEAH.

212
00:07:10,568 --> 00:07:12,397
- NOT, YOU KNOW--
- DECENT SIZED.

213
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:13,674
- NOT HUGE.

214
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:15,365
- YOU WANT TO TRY
MY HOMEMADE PICKLES?

215
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:16,677
THEY'’RE REALLY DILL, THOUGH.

216
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:18,852
- WHAT'’S "DILL" MEAN?

217
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:20,888
- LIKE TART.
- WHAT'’S "TART" MEAN?

218
00:07:20,888 --> 00:07:23,339
- REALLY--YOU'’LL KNOW
AS SOON AS YOU TASTE IT.

219
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,272
- THAT'’S WHAT HOMEMADE PICKLES
TASTE LIKE.

220
00:07:25,272 --> 00:07:27,377
I LIKE THEM.
- THANKS.

221
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:32,244
SHE LIKES THEM,
AND SHE'’S A PICKLE EXPERT.

222
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:35,524
- TAKE THIS OFF NOW?
- YEAH, IF YOU WANT.

223
00:07:35,524 --> 00:07:37,560
DUDE, I GOT
THREE BAGS OF IV.

224
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,942
- AND YOU ONLY PEED TWICE.

225
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:41,115
- THAT'’S HOW DEHYDRATED
YOU WERE.

226
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:42,600
- THAT'’S WHAT I SAID.

227
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,776
- ♪ BABY, BABY, BABY,
I'’M READY FOR YOU ♪

228
00:07:46,776 --> 00:07:48,329
♪ I'’M READY FOR YOU ♪

229
00:07:48,329 --> 00:07:50,573
- I HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO BECOME A LADY AGAIN.

230
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:53,369
I'’M SO USED TO WEARING
MY GYM OUTFITS.

231
00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:57,477
ME, JOEY, AND LAUREN ARE HAVING
JUST REGULAR GIRL TIME,

232
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,169
AND WE OBVIOUSLY GET
INTO GIRLY CONVERSATIONS.

233
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:02,205
- HOW'’S NICOLE DOING?

234
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:04,173
- VERY PREGNANT.

235
00:08:04,173 --> 00:08:05,485
IF I COULD HAVE
A PERFECT WORLD,

236
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,210
ONE OF MY KIDS
IS GONNA MARRY NICOLE'’S,

237
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,729
AND ONE OF MY KIDS
IS GONNA MARRY YOURS.

238
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:10,835
- OH, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

239
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:13,009
- THAT'’S MY PERFECT WORLD.
- LET'’S ARRANGE THEIR MARRIAGES.

240
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,494
[laughs]

241
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,186
- SO SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, WHEN
ARE YOU GOING TO GET MARRIED?

242
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:18,739
- I DON'’T KNOW.

243
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:21,190
- I WANT IT TO HAPPEN.
- ME TOO.

244
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,261
- CAN WE, LIKE,
DESIGN YOUR DRESS?

245
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:25,056
- DRESS SHOPPING
IS SO MUCH FUN.

246
00:08:25,056 --> 00:08:26,402
- IS IT?
- MM-HMM.

247
00:08:26,402 --> 00:08:27,921
- IS IT [bleep] UP
TO GO TRY ON DRESSES

248
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,923
BEFORE YOU'’RE ENGAGED?
- NO.

249
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:31,545
- NO, THAT'’D BE FUN.
- YES!

250
00:08:31,545 --> 00:08:34,617
THAT'’S LIKE--YOU'’RE LIKE
A WEIRD WOMAN AT THAT POINT.

251
00:08:34,617 --> 00:08:35,998
- THAT'’S TYPICAL WOMAN.

252
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:38,000
- WHAT'’S THE HARM
IN TRYING ON, LIKE,

253
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,933
SOMETHING JUST TO SEE
WHAT TYPE THAT YOU LIKE?

254
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,935
- MIGHT GET YOUR HOPES UP.

255
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:44,247
- YOU KNOW THAT IT'’S GONNA
HAPPEN EVENTUALLY.

256
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:46,042
- IT'’S NOT THE PROPOSAL
THAT I ACTUALLY WANT,

257
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,250
OR THE ENGAGEMENT.

258
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,806
IT'’S THE RING THAT I WANT.
- [laughs]

259
00:08:50,806 --> 00:08:52,911
- I DON'’T EVEN CARE
ABOUT THE MARRIAGE PART.

260
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:54,499
I'’M NOT TRADITIONAL
IN ANY SENSE.

261
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:56,605
I JUST WANT
A REALLY SPECIFIC RING,

262
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:58,227
AND I WOULD LIKE HIM
TO GET THAT FOR ME.

263
00:08:58,227 --> 00:09:00,125
WE'’RE ALREADY BASICALLY
MARRIED.

264
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,368
IF THERE WAS, LIKE,
A COMMON LAW

265
00:09:01,368 --> 00:09:03,025
OF TWO YEARS,
WE'’D BE MARRIED.

266
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:04,923
- SO YOU JUST WANT HIM
TO GIVE YOU THAT RING?

267
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:06,891
- YEAH.

268
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:11,516
- LOOK AT THAT TEDDY BEAR.
- OH, MY GOD!

269
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:13,069
- NICOLE'’S HAVING ONE CHILD.

270
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:14,450
SHE'’S NOT HAVING TRIPLETS
OR ANYTHING.

271
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,590
I'’VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

272
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,661
I'’VE NEVER SEEN SO MANY GIFTS
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

273
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:20,352
- LOOK AT ALL THIS [bleep]
HE HAS.

274
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,665
- I FEEL LIKE IT'’S MY BIRTHDAY.
- OH, I LOVE THIS.

275
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:24,805
- DUDE, THERE'’S MORE [bleep]
IN THIS CORNER.

276
00:09:24,805 --> 00:09:26,462
- YEAH, WHY DON'’T YOU GO
IN THAT CORNER?

277
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:28,015
- OH, MY GOD.

278
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:29,465
I AM NOT PREPARED.

279
00:09:29,465 --> 00:09:30,915
I DON'’T KNOW WHERE
WE'’RE GOING TO PUT THIS STUFF.

280
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:32,779
HE'’S NOT EVEN BORN YET
AND HE'’S GOT TOO MANY TOYS.

281
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,228
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

282
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:36,437
- OH, IT'’S TO DO MY BELLY--
A MOLD.

283
00:09:36,437 --> 00:09:37,922
- CAN I DO IT FOR YOU?

284
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:39,993
- YEAH.
- NICE.

285
00:09:39,993 --> 00:09:41,408
- NO.
- WHY?

286
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:42,858
- LET ME READ THAT.

287
00:09:42,858 --> 00:09:44,066
- WHA--?

288
00:09:44,066 --> 00:09:45,412
- EVERY PREGNANT LADY DOES IT.

289
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:47,034
- JESUS, GET HER OUT OF HERE.

290
00:09:47,034 --> 00:09:48,553
- BELLY CASTING KIT,
I NEVER--

291
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:50,693
- YOU HAVEN'’T HAD KIDS IN,
LIKE, 20 YEARS.

292
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:54,248
- "DIP PLASTER STRIPS INTO WATER
AND PRESS THEM ONTO THE SKIN."

293
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:56,216
I DON'’T KNOW.

294
00:09:56,216 --> 00:09:58,183
- LOOK HOW SMALL
HE'’S GONNA BE.

295
00:09:58,183 --> 00:09:59,875
- NEVER EMBARRASS BABY AGAIN.

296
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,911
- WHAT IS THAT?
- A DUMBBELL.

297
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:03,395
- IT'’S ACTUALLY A RATTLE.

298
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,121
- IT'’S A RATTLE.
RATTLE GOES--

299
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:06,709
UH, TOYS, OVER HERE.
RATTLES HERE.

300
00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:08,711
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'’S A 2-OUNCE DUMBBELL.

301
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:10,610
- OH, ALCOHOL STRIPS.

302
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,026
TOLD YOU, YOU CAN TEST YOUR--
YOU CAN DRINK.

303
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:14,544
JENNI IS A GENIUS

304
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:17,340
BECAUSE SHE GOT ME
THE ALCOHOL TESTING STRIPS

305
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,895
FOR BREAST MILK,
AND I'’M LIKE "THANK GOD,"

306
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,586
BECAUSE I PUT IT
ON MY REGISTRY,

307
00:10:21,586 --> 00:10:22,829
BUT THEN MY MOM TOLD ME
TO TAKE IT OFF

308
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:24,278
'’CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
I'’M TRASHY,

309
00:10:24,278 --> 00:10:25,486
I'’M LIKE,
"MOM, BUT I NEED THEM."

310
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:27,523
I WONDER IF I COULD PUMP NOW.
WE SHOULD TRY.

311
00:10:27,523 --> 00:10:28,904
- NO.
- YES.

312
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:30,043
- SERIOUSLY--
- YES!

313
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:31,389
- NO, YOU CAN NOT--
- YES!

314
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:32,597
- YOU DON'’T DO STUFF
LIKE THAT.

315
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:33,874
- I'’M PUMPING
YOUR [bleep] TONIGHT.

316
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:36,843
- YOU WILL MILK ME.
JIONNI'’S GONNA MILK ME.

317
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:39,259
- CAN'’T WAIT.
- JIONNI, STOP IT.

318
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:41,571
NO, YOU'’RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

319
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:43,401
- AS SOON AS YOU FALL ASLEEP,
YOU'’RE GETTING PUMPED.

320
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:45,714
- I REALLY WANT TO SEE IF MILK
COMES OUT OF MY BOOBS TOO.

321
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:48,164
LIKE, FOR REAL.

322
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,028
- I THINK IT'’S ON BACKWARDS,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

323
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:51,478
- OH, IT'’S A TWO-WAY CARRIER.

324
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:54,067
- YEAH, TWO-WAY.

325
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,724
[sneezes]

326
00:10:55,724 --> 00:10:56,828
[laughter]

327
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:59,141
- HE JUST SNEEZED ON THE BABY.

328
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:01,661
OH, MY GOD.
THAT KID'’S ALREADY DEAD.

329
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,765
- SORRY.

330
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:04,249
DO I LOOK LIKE A DAD?

331
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:05,699
- YEAH, YOU DO.

332
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,252
A HOT DAD.

333
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:08,598
YOU'’RE A D.I.L.F.

334
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,497
- MY MOM'’S HERE.

335
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:13,811

I KNOW YOU WANTED
TO EAT OUTSIDE,

674
00:22:36,941 --> 00:22:38,874
BUT THERE'’S REALLY
NOWHERE TO EAT OUTSIDE HERE.

675
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:40,048
- OKAY.

676
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:42,119

- WELL, YOU'’RE
ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH.

681
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,680
- YOU'’RE ANNOYING.
- WHY?

682
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,028
- '’CAUSE YOU'’RE, LIKE, SKINNY,
AND I LOOK LIKE A WHALE.

683
00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:57,168
- BECAUSE ME AND NICOLE
ARE IN COMMITTED RELATIONSHIPS,

684
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:58,480
SHE'’S ABOUT TO HAVE A BABY,

685
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,793
BUT YET, WE STILL TALK
TO EACH OTHER EVERY DAY.

686
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:03,278
- AND WE STILL MAKE TIME
FOR EACH OTHER.

687
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:04,797
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THIS WEEKEND?

688
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:05,901
- NOTHING.

689
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,179
- WANT TO COME DOWN?

690
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,043
JUST DON'’T MENTION
THE ENGAGEMENT.

691
00:23:10,043 --> 00:23:11,735
- THAT'’S ALL I WANT
TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT.

692
00:23:11,735 --> 00:23:13,426
- I THINK
HE'’S GETTING REALLY ANNOYED.

693
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:14,979
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.

694
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:18,224
- MAYBE I WON'’T TALK TO HIM.
I DON'’T WANT TO GET HIM MAD.

695
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:20,709
- IT IS, LIKE,
A STATUS SYMBOL FOR ME.

696
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:21,883
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

697
00:23:21,883 --> 00:23:25,093
- LIKE A RING, ENGAGEMENT.

698
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:27,095
LOOK AT THIS.
THIS IS HOW I PICTURE MY RING.

699
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:29,649
I DATE SOMEONE 6'’4",

700
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:32,721
LARGER-THAN-LIFE
PERSONALITY AND PHYSIQUE.

701
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:34,205
- HUGE PEE-PEE.

702
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:37,519
- THAT'’S HOW I LOOK AT IT
WHEN IT COMES TO HIS RING--

703
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,865
HAS TO BE
LARGER THAN LIFE.

704
00:23:38,865 --> 00:23:40,522
EVEN THOUGH
WE'’RE AVERAGE PEOPLE,

705
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:41,903
WE DON'’T ACT AVERAGE.

706
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:43,801
MY [bleep] ARE NOT [bleep]
AVERAGE [bleep].

707
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,458
LIKE, THEY'’RE [bleep] LARGE
AND IN CHARGE.

708
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,495
SO, BY SAYING THAT,
LIKE FOR US,

709
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:49,842
TO ASK ROGER TO GET ME
AN AVERAGE RING,

710
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:51,568
IT WOULDN'’T HAPPEN.

711
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:53,190
I WANT THE RING THAT I WANT,

712
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,399
WHICH I KNOW IS GOING TO TAKE
A LONG TIME TO MAKE.

713
00:23:55,399 --> 00:23:57,608
I CAN'’T EVEN EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU.

714
00:23:57,608 --> 00:24:00,266
- I WANT TO TAKE YOU
TO THE JEWELER'’S.

715
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:01,578
SINCE I'’M SEEING ROGER
TOMORROW,

716
00:24:01,578 --> 00:24:03,856
MAYBE IF I DO TALK TO HIM
ABOUT THE RING,

717
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:05,616
HE'’LL HAVE AN IDEA,
AT LEAST.

718
00:24:05,616 --> 00:24:08,274
- I ASKED ROGER
FOR HIS PERMISSION.

719
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:10,276
HE SAID LOOKING FOR RINGS
HE DIDN'’T WANT ME TO DO,

720
00:24:10,276 --> 00:24:12,140
BUT I'’LL DO IT ANYWAYS.

721
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,486
- I DEFINITELY
WOULD LIKE JENNI

722
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:15,419
TO SHOW ME A COUPLE RINGS
THAT SHE WANTS,

723
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:18,249
SO, THEN, YOU KNOW, IF ROGER
DOES ASK ME TO GO WITH HIM,

724
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:20,286
THEN I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT TO GET.

725
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:21,908
HOW MANY CARATS DO YOU WANT?

726
00:24:21,908 --> 00:24:23,738
- I WANT A 5 MIDDLE...
- OKAY.

727
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:25,705
- PRINCESS CUT,
AND THEN I'’M GONNA--

728
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:29,019
LOOKING AT GETTING
PINK DIAMONDS AROUND IT.

729
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:30,572
I LOVE PINK
AND BLACK DIAMONDS,

730
00:24:30,572 --> 00:24:32,954
SO I WOULD LIKE
1- TO 2-CARAT,

731
00:24:32,954 --> 00:24:35,750
EACH SIDE BEING PINK,
AND A BAND WITH PINK DIAMONDS.

732
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,992
- WOW.

733
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:38,960
- THAT'’S WHY ROGER'’S
LIVER AND KIDNEY

734
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,997
ARE CURRENTLY BEING SOLD
ON THE BLACK MARKET.

735
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:45,000
- WE SELL A SIX-CARAT NATURAL
PINK DIAMOND,

736
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,726
AND IT'’S ABOUT
A MILLION DOLLARS.

737
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:48,728
- YEAH.

738
00:24:48,728 --> 00:24:50,834
- SO, IF I HAD TO GUESS--
- YEAH, RIGHT.

739
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:53,906
- $40,000 OR $50,000
FOR A ONE-CARAT STONE.

740
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:55,494
- YEAH.

741
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,600
- $200,000?
- WHAT!

742
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,085
- THAT'’S CRAZY.
THAT'’S A HOUSE.

743
00:25:01,085 --> 00:25:05,193
I THINK JENNI'’S RING IS ABSURD,
AND THAT'’S A BIG WORD.

744
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:07,264
I DON'’T THINK
THIS IS A CLASSY RING.

745
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:09,404
I JUST THINK
THIS IS A VERY EXPENSIVE RING.

746
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:10,854
A CLASSY RING WOULD
BE JUST, LIKE,

747
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:12,511
A LITTLE ROCK AND THAT'’S IT.

748
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,202
BUT TO HAVE, LIKE, PINK IN IT,

749
00:25:14,202 --> 00:25:16,549
AND, LIKE,
DIFFERENT PINK STONES,

750
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,240
I MEAN, THAT'’S A TOTAL
JENNI RING.

751
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,519
I HAVE A TUMMY ACHE
JUST FOR ROGER.

752
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,486
- I LOOK AT IT LIKE THIS.
WE'’RE TOGETHER.

753
00:25:22,486 --> 00:25:24,039
I KNOW WE'’RE GOING
TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

754
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:27,146
SO NOW IT'’S ON HIM,
AND EVERY YEAR HE WAITS,

755
00:25:27,146 --> 00:25:29,493
EVERY YEAR I CHANGE MY MIND
ON WHAT RING I WANT.

756
00:25:29,493 --> 00:25:31,184
- SO, CLEAN--
- AND MY MIND DOESN'’T GO DOWN.

757
00:25:31,184 --> 00:25:32,841
- RIGHT. IT ALWAYS GOES UP.
- IT ALWAYS GOES UP.

758
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,705
- THE LONGER YOU WAIT,
THE BIGGER THE STONE HAS TO BE.

759
00:25:34,705 --> 00:25:35,810
- YEAH, GOOD LUCK.

760
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,605
- [laughter]

761
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:39,986
- I'’M GOING TO BEAT UP
THIS LITTLE KID OVER HERE.

762
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:41,954
I'’M NOT THE TYPE OF GUY
THAT CAN GO OUT, PACE HIMSELF,

763
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,300
AND ONLY HAVE
ONE OR TWO DRINKS.

764
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,543
IT WOULD DEFEAT
THE PURPOSE OF GOING OUT.

765
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,061
- OH, MY GOD,
HE'’S GOING TO THROW HIM.

766
00:25:46,061 --> 00:25:49,099
- WHAT'’S THE MATTER?
- I JUST DON'’T FEEL GOOD.

767
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:52,171
MY HEART'’S RACING.
MY STOMACH IS HUGE.

768
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:53,655
I'’M OVER BEING PREGNANT.

769
00:25:53,655 --> 00:25:55,415
I CAN'’T DO IT.
I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

770
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:56,382
- WHERE WERE YOU JUST NOW?

771
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,665
- WHAT DO YOU WANT,
CHICKEN PARM TONIGHT?

772
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:05,011
- YEAH.

773
00:26:05,011 --> 00:26:06,392
SO TONIGHT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE DATE NIGHT

774
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:08,014
WHERE JIONNI'’S GONNA
TAKE ME OUT,

775
00:26:08,014 --> 00:26:10,085
BUT HONESTLY,
I DON'’T FEEL LIKE GOING OUT.

776
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:11,880
I DON'’T FEEL LIKE DRESSING UP
IN A DRESS.

777
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,330
I JUST WANT TO BE IN PAJAMAS,

778
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,540
SO JIONNI COOKING ME DINNER
TONIGHT IS THE PERFECT SOLUTION.

779
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,716
- WHY DON'’T YOU GO LAY DOWN?
- I JUST WANT TO CUDDLE.

780
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:22,719
- GO LAY DOWN
AND I'’LL GO GET EVERYTHING.

781
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,548
- WHERE YOU GOING?

782
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:26,964
- GROCERY SHOPPING.
- WHERE?

783
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:28,552
- THE BEST PART
ABOUT LIVING AT HOME,

784
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:30,796
I GOT A GROCERY STORE
RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

785
00:26:30,796 --> 00:26:33,177
I JUST WRITE
MY LITTLE GROCERY LIST DOWN,

786
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:35,939
I GET MY BAG,
I GO UPSTAIRS AND GO SHOPPING.

787
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:38,182
AW, I NEED A BLENDER.

788
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:40,806
I NEED A SALAD BOWL.

789
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:42,462
WHERE'’S THAT, UH, THINGAMAJIG?

790
00:26:42,462 --> 00:26:44,326
GEE, GOLLY, THANKS, MOM.

791
00:26:44,326 --> 00:26:47,813
- SERIOUSLY,
DON'’T YOU HAVE STUFF?

792
00:26:47,813 --> 00:26:49,297
YOU HAVE A KITCHEN.

793
00:26:49,297 --> 00:26:52,058
- TONIGHT, I AM MAKING NICOLE
A FEAST OF MASHED POTATOES,

794
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:54,060
CHICKEN PARM, SALAD,

795
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,475
BROCCOLI, AND CORN.

796
00:26:55,475 --> 00:26:56,787
[gasps]

797
00:26:56,787 --> 00:26:58,824
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU SCARED ME.

798
00:26:58,824 --> 00:27:00,584
DO YOU HAVE POT HOLDERS?

799
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:01,999
- NO, I HAVE RAGS.
- NO, NO, NO.

800
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:03,104
YOU'’RE GONNA BURN YOURSELF.
I'’LL THROW THEM DOWN.

801
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:04,174
- NO, I'’M NOT.

802
00:27:04,174 --> 00:27:05,244
- NO?
- NO.

803
00:27:05,244 --> 00:27:07,487
- AHH!
CAN I HAVE POT HOLDERS?

804
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:09,455
- OH, MY GOD.

805
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:15,461
- BABE?
- WHAT?

806
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:17,325
- WHAT YOU THINK?

807
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:18,637
- I LIKE IT.
YOU'’RE A SEX MACHINE...

808
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,017
WITHOUT THE SEX.

809
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:21,294
THE PLAN IS TO GO
TO KARMA TONIGHT.

810
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:22,537
WE HAVEN'’T BEEN THERE
IN A LITTLE BIT.

811
00:27:22,537 --> 00:27:24,021
- BABE, THE CAB'’S HERE.

812
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:26,645
- YOU KNOW, GOT MY LITTLE CIRCLE
OF FRIENDS OVER.

813
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,336
YOU KNOW,
I'’M GONNA GET WHITE-BOY WASTED,

814
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:30,649
BUT STILL GONNA BE
THE MATURE ONE IN THE GROUP.

815
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,651
- OH, MY GOD, I CAN'’T BELIEVE
WE'’RE AT KARMA RIGHT NOW.

816
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,962
- IF THERE'’S NOT A FIGHT
RIGHT NOW,

817
00:27:33,962 --> 00:27:35,170
THERE WILL BE
IN FIVE MINUTES, HANG ON.

818
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,275
- HOW ARE YOU?

819
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:37,725
- HOW YOU DOING, JENNI?
- GOOD.

820
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:41,280
- ♪ YOU SEND ME FLYING ♪

821
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,249
♪ WITHOUT EVEN TRYING ♪

822
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:50,151
- SO WE'’RE ALL PARTYING
AT KARMA, AND I INVITED DANNY,

823
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:52,429
AND I'’M SO EXCITED,
BECAUSE I HAVEN'’T SEEN

824
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:55,501
MY FELLOW SHORE STORE EMPLOYEES
IN FOREVER.

825
00:27:55,501 --> 00:28:00,299
- THIS GUY,
THIS FREAKIN'’ GUY RIGHT HERE.

826
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:01,576
DANNY'’S A GOOD GUY.

827
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:03,095
DANNY'’S REAL EASYGOING,
REAL LAID-BACK.

828
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:05,718
SO, YOU KNOW, I DECIDED TO
LIVEN UP HIS MOOD A LITTLE BIT.

829
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:08,203
- THAT'’S OUR BOSS!

830
00:28:08,203 --> 00:28:10,136
OH, MY GOD,
HE'’S GOING TO THROW HIM.

831
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:17,040
- I MADE YOU DINNER.

832
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,697
- I'’M SO HUNGRY.

833
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,284
- I AM GOING ALL OUT TONIGHT.

834
00:28:20,284 --> 00:28:22,424
I WANT TO MAKE THIS ROMANTIC.
I WANT TO MAKE THIS SPECIAL.

835
00:28:22,424 --> 00:28:24,219
YOU KNOW, NICOLE'’S UNDER
THE WEATHER, SHE'’S PREGNANT.

836
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:26,187
I WANT TO MAKE HER FEEL GOOD.

837
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:27,809
- I LOVE IT.

838
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:30,122
- DO YOU KNOW I LEGIT
MADE EVERYTHING MYSELF?

839
00:28:30,122 --> 00:28:32,227
- I BELIEVE YOU.

840
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:34,713
LOOKS DELICIOUS.
YOU MADE THAT YOURSELF?

841
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:35,955
- SWEAR TO GOD.

842
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:37,716
- I THINK JIONNI'’S
AN EXCELLENT COOK.

843
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,925
I THINK HE TAKES AFTER HIS MOM,
AND YOU KNOW,

844
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:42,375
IT'’S KIND OF SEXY
KNOWING THAT YOUR MAN CAN COOK.

845
00:28:42,375 --> 00:28:44,377
- ARE YOU NERVOUS
FOR TOMORROW?

846
00:28:44,377 --> 00:28:45,654
- NO.

847
00:28:45,654 --> 00:28:48,796
- YOU SHOULD GET A LIST
OF QUESTIONS FOR THIS LADY.

848
00:28:48,796 --> 00:28:52,006
- I'’M GONNA GET A PAD.

849
00:28:52,006 --> 00:28:53,490
- WELL, I'’M GONNA GO SIT
ON THE COUCH WATCHING FOOTBALL

850
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:54,663
WHILE YOU DO THE DISHES.

851
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:56,079
- OH, GET REAL.

852
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:58,012
- SO TOMORROW WE'’RE HAVING
A BABY TEACHER COME OVER

853
00:28:58,012 --> 00:29:01,947
TO BASICALLY TEACH US
HOW TO DEAL WITH NEWBORNS,

854
00:29:01,947 --> 00:29:04,018
AND WHAT WE'’RE GOING
TO GET OURSELVES INTO.

855
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:06,330
HOW OFTEN DO YOU BATHE HIM?

856
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,401
- HOW OFTEN DO YOU BATHE?

857
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:10,956
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
JUST WRITE BATHE.

858
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:13,027
HOW OFTEN DO YOU CHANGE
A DIAPER?

859
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:15,374
IF HE'’S CRYING,
AND HE'’S NOT HUNGRY,

860
00:29:15,374 --> 00:29:18,342
AND HIS DIAPER'’S BEEN CHANGED,
WHAT COULD IT BE?

861
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:20,655
- HE WANTS TO BE HELD.

862
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:22,864
- YOU DON'’T KNOW.
- HE WANTS MY NIPPLE.

863
00:29:22,864 --> 00:29:24,763
- HE ALREADY ATE.

864
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,937
- HE WANTS TO BE HELD.
HE WANTS TO BE LOVED.

865
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:28,145
- I'’M NOT ASKING YOU.
WE'’RE ASKING HER.

866
00:29:28,145 --> 00:29:29,284
- HE WANTS TO BE CUDDLED.

867
00:29:29,284 --> 00:29:30,423
- PUT IT DOWN.

868
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:33,116
HOW MANY OUNCES OF FORMULA
DO YOU USE?

869
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:35,083
- HE'’S SUCKING ON MY BOOB.

870
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:36,533
- HOW DOES HE KNOW
WHEN TO STOP?

871
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:39,847
- '’CAUSE HE'’S FULL.

872
00:29:39,847 --> 00:29:42,435
- NO, MAYBE
HE'’LL JUST KEEP GOING.

873
00:29:42,435 --> 00:29:44,127
- IF THE BABY'’S FULL,
HE'’S FULL.

874
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:45,818
- OKAY.

875
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:47,268
HOW DO YOU HOLD HIM?

876
00:29:47,268 --> 00:29:49,132

I'’M NOT THE TYPE OF GUY THAT
CAN GO OUT, AND PACE HIMSELF,

880
00:29:54,896 --> 00:29:56,311
AND ONLY HAVE
ONE OR TWO DRINKS.

881
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:57,657
IT DEFEATS THE PURPOSE
OF GOING OUT.

882
00:29:57,657 --> 00:29:58,866
I MIGHT AS WELL
STAY AT HOME.

883

NIGHT LAST NIGHT AT KARMA.

ALL THOSE SHOTS WERE WORTH IT,
BUT I FEEL LIKE [bleep].

- OUR BABY COACH LILLIAN
IS COMING TODAY,

909
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:15,874
AND SHE'’S GOING TO TEACH US
HOW TO DEAL WITH NEWBORNS.

910
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,082
I'’M NOT GOING TO LIE.

911
00:31:17,082 --> 00:31:18,877
I DON'’T KNOW [bleep]
ABOUT NEWBORNS.

912
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,501
- SO, I WANT TO KIND OF GET
AN IDEA OF WHAT YOU KNOW,

913
00:31:22,501 --> 00:31:23,916
AND WHERE DO YOU NEED

914
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,436
A LITTLE BIT MORE OF
REINFORCEMENT OR CLARIFICATION.

915
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:27,989
- EVERYTHING.

916
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:29,577
- OKAY, SO WE CAN DEAL
WITH EVERYTHING.

917
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:31,475
YOU HIDE YOUR ANSWERS
FROM HER.

918
00:31:31,475 --> 00:31:34,030
- BUT WE'’RE PARTNERS.
- OH, GOD.

919
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,963
I AM REAL NERVOUS
ABOUT THIS.

920
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:37,965
NICOLE'’S READ ABOUT
TWO OR THREE PREGNANCY BOOKS,

921
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:40,381

HALF A PREGNANCY BOOK.

- 10 FEET.
- 50 FEET.

IT'’S TWO.

AND ONE IN THE BACK.

YOU KNOW, LIKE,
EXPELLED FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

932
00:32:08,167 --> 00:32:11,032

00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:28,015
- SHOULD WE BE
WRITING THINGS DOWN?

- I WANT LORENZO PART
OF OUR WEDDING.

1001
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:27,030
- OKAY.

1002
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:29,688
- HE CAN BE A RING BEARER.

1003
00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:32,449
- [bleep],
HE MIGHT BE TEN BY THEN.

1004
00:34:32,449 --> 00:34:34,969
- [laughter]
- DID YOU SEE HER FACE?

1005
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,867
SHE'’S KIDDING.
- GAVE A LOOK.

1006
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,179
- NO. NOBODY'’S PRESSURING ME.

1007
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,491
I'’M MOVING AT MY OWN PACE.

1008
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:41,009
- SO I DON'’T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT THAT,

1009
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:44,151
BECAUSE I DON'’T WANT
TO GET DISAPPOINTED

1010
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:46,601
IF IT DOESN'’T HAPPEN
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS.

1011
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:49,949
I'’D RATHER
JUST BE BLINDSIDED.

1012
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,503
SIDEBLINDED.

1013
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:52,780
[bleep], ONE OF TH--I DON'’T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL IT'’S CALLED.

1014
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:54,092
- YEAH, WHATEVER.

1015
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,265
- ARE YOU SURE LORENZO'’S
SIX POUNDS RIGHT NOW?

1016
00:34:55,265 --> 00:34:56,611
- YEAH.
- THAT'’S WHAT HE SAID.

1017
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,268
THAT'’S, LIKE,
A LOT OF WEIGHT I'’M CARRYING.

1018
00:34:58,268 --> 00:34:59,442
- HOW DO YOU FEEL, THOUGH?
BACK HURT?

1019
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:01,202
- SUFFERING.
- SLEEPING GOOD?

1020
00:35:01,202 --> 00:35:02,479
- NO.
- NO.

1021
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:03,929
NERVOUS AT ALL?

1022
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:05,137
- YEAH.

1023
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:06,311
- SHE'’S JUST NERVOUS
ABOUT THE ACTUAL BIRTH.

1024
00:35:06,311 --> 00:35:07,691
- I'’M SO NERVOUS.

1025
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,072
- YOU NEVER KNOW IF SHE COULD
GO NEXT WEEK, YOU KNOW?

1026
00:35:09,072 --> 00:35:10,556
YOUR WATER BREAKS, WE ARE
HIGHTAILING IT OUT OF HERE.

1027
00:35:10,556 --> 00:35:11,971
- I HONESTLY THOUGHT
IT WAS GOING TO

1028
00:35:11,971 --> 00:35:13,628
IN THE BATHROOM JUST NOW.
- I MEAN HIGHTAILING IT.

1029
00:35:13,628 --> 00:35:15,078
- [screams]
- STOP!

1030
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:16,493
- ESAU, GET OVER HERE.

1031
00:35:16,493 --> 00:35:19,393
- MY STOMACH IS KILLING ME.

1032
00:35:19,393 --> 00:35:21,567
CAN WE GET GOING SOON?
- YEAH.

1033
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:23,431
- I'’M VERY UNCOMFORTABLE.

1034
00:35:23,431 --> 00:35:26,227
IT'’S HARD FOR ME TO EVEN SIT,
TO WALK, TO DO ANYTHING.

1035
00:35:26,227 --> 00:35:28,540
I JUST WANT TO GET HOME
AND LAY DOWN.

1036
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,024
- BYE!
- BYE, GUYS!

1037
00:35:30,024 --> 00:35:31,267
- THANK YOU!
- THANK YOU.

1038
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:33,027
- BYE. GET HOME SAFE.
DRIVE SAFE.

1039
00:35:33,027 --> 00:35:36,341
- BYE!

1040
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:37,618
- DID YOU HAVE FUN?

1041
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:42,140
- YES, MINUS THE CRAMPS.

1042
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,073
THESE PAINS RIGHT NOW,
I THINK I'’M GOING EARLIER.

1043
00:35:45,073 --> 00:35:47,006
OH, DEAR.

1044
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:48,525
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- MM.

1045
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:50,665
- IF YOUR WATER BREAKS--
- STOP IT.

1046
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:54,669
UGH. I'’M IN SO MUCH PAIN.

1047
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:56,084
- WHAT IF IT'’S NEXT WEEK?

1048
00:35:56,084 --> 00:35:57,396
- I'’M NOT KIDDING,
I THINK IT IS.

1049
00:35:57,396 --> 00:35:59,433
- AW, [bleep].

1050
00:35:59,433 --> 00:36:00,675
NOW I'’M NERVOUS.

1051
00:36:00,675 --> 00:36:02,125
- SO ON THE RIDE HOME,

1052
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:03,713
I'’M JUST FEELING
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE

1053
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:05,922
TO THE POINT WHERE I HAVE
TO PUT MY SEAT BACK.

1054
00:36:05,922 --> 00:36:07,579
I'’M, LIKE,
HOLDING MY STOMACH UP,

1055
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:10,927
AND I'’M JUST FEELING, LIKE,
THESE SEVERE CRAMPS.

1056
00:36:10,927 --> 00:36:12,929
AND I DON'’T KNOW WHAT'’S GOING ON
RIGHT NOW. I'’M SCARED.

1057
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:14,965
THIS [bleep] HURTS.

1058
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,451
JESUS, TAKE THE WHEEL.

1059
00:36:22,456 --> 00:36:24,803
- THERE'’S MORE
SNOOKI AND JWOWWON THE WAY...

1060
00:36:24,803 --> 00:36:26,908
- AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

1061
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:32,949
- OOH, I'’M GOING TO MAKE
SOMETHING.

1062
00:36:32,949 --> 00:36:34,295
WATCH THIS, MOTHER.

1063
00:36:34,295 --> 00:36:36,090
THERE'’S TONS OF FOOD
ON SUNDAY DINNER.

1064
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:39,645
MY MOM LEGIT WAKES UP
AT PROBABLY 4:00 OR 5:00

1065
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:42,200
AND JUST COOKS LIKE A MANIAC.

1066
00:36:44,823 --> 00:36:47,205
I'’M GONNA TEACH YOU SOMETHING
FOR ONCE.

1067
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,999
- YEAH, GO AHEAD.
IT'’LL BE A REAL MIRACLE.

1068
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,415
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- NOTHING.

1069
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:52,486
- ITALIANS DO IT RIGHT
ON SUNDAY.

1070
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:54,971
WE HAVE THE WHOLE FAMILY.
WE EAT LIKE MANIACS.

1071
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:56,766
ALL MY BROTHERS
AND SISTERS COME.

1072
00:36:56,766 --> 00:36:58,146
NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE,

1073
00:36:58,146 --> 00:36:59,803
YOU HAVE TO BE HERE AT MY HOUSE
FOR SUNDAY DINNER.

1074
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:02,323
- JIONNI, DID YOU SEE
THE ROOM UPSTAIRS?

1075
00:37:02,323 --> 00:37:05,257
- YEAH, IT LOOKS AWESOME.
NICOLE'’S GONNA LOVE IT.

1076
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:09,848
BABE, HOW YOU FEELING?

1077
00:37:09,848 --> 00:37:12,540
- OH, GOD,
I'’M SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

1078
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,955
I JUST DON'’T FEEL RIGHT.

1079
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:16,199
I FEEL LIKE I'’M GONNA
HAVE THIS BABY SOON.

1080
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,580
AND RIGHT NOW,
I JUST WANT TO BE ALONE.

1081
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,685
AND IT KIND OF SUCKS
BECAUSE IT'’S SUNDAY DINNER.

1082
00:37:19,685 --> 00:37:21,791
AND EVERYONE'’S GONNA BE HERE.

1083
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,068
- HI!

1084
00:37:23,068 --> 00:37:24,725
- HI, JANELLE.

1085
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:26,140
- HI, NELLY.

1086
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,107
JIONNI'’S COOKING
THE WHOLE DINNER FOR YOU.

1087
00:37:28,107 --> 00:37:29,385
- '’CAUSE YOU'’RE
MY FAVORITE SISTER.

1088
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:30,662
- YOUR ONLY SISTER.

1089
00:37:30,662 --> 00:37:31,973
- WE HAVE THE WHOLE FAMILY.

1090
00:37:31,973 --> 00:37:33,837
WE GOT MY MOM,
MY DAD, JOSEPH.

1091
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:36,840
I GOT MY BROTHER JOE, HIS BABY
JOEY, AND HIS WIFE GISELLE,

1092
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,152
MY SISTER JANELLE,

1093
00:37:38,152 --> 00:37:40,879
MY BROTHER-IN-LAW MIKE,
MY LITTLE NEPHEW BABY MIKE,

1094
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,570
ME AND NICOLE,
JACKIE.

1095
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,916
EVERYONE'’S
THERE JUST TO EAT,

1096
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:45,297
AND EVERYONE'’S
JUST HAVING A GOOD TIME.

1097
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:47,023
- OH, HE'’S GOT A LITTLE
BLACK AND BLUE ON HIS HEAD.

1098
00:37:47,023 --> 00:37:51,096
WHERE'’D HE GET THAT FROM?
- SCRATCHING HIMSELF.

1099
00:37:51,096 --> 00:37:53,961
- HEY, JACK.

1100
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:55,687
HI, BOO.

1101
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:57,413
- HI.
HOW YOU FEELING?

1102
00:37:57,413 --> 00:37:58,828
- HURT REALLY BAD.

1103
00:37:58,828 --> 00:38:00,554
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING
INTO LABOR LAST NIGHT.

1104
00:38:00,554 --> 00:38:02,314
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

1105
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:04,627
I'’M TRYING TO PUT ON
A FACE RIGHT NOW,

1106
00:38:04,627 --> 00:38:06,698
BUT HONESTLY, LIKE,
I JUST WANT TO DIE.

1107
00:38:06,698 --> 00:38:08,838
WELL, NOT DIE,
BUT I JUST DON'’T FEEL

1108
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:10,529
LIKE BEING
AROUND PEOPLE TODAY

1109
00:38:10,529 --> 00:38:13,049
BECAUSE I'’M SO TIRED OF TRYING
TO MAKE THIS PREGNANCY

1110
00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:14,430
SEEM LIKE IT'’S SO EASY,

1111
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,121
WHEN REALLY IT'’S NOT
AND IT'’S KILLING ME.

1112
00:38:16,121 --> 00:38:17,329
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON, GUYS,
SIT OUTSIDE.

1113
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:21,057
NICOLE'’S SITTING BY HERSELF.

1114
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:22,438
HERE, PUT THIS OVER HERE.
PUT IT ON THE TABLE?

1115
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:24,474
MOVE THAT HUGE THING
IN THE MIDDLE.

1116
00:38:24,474 --> 00:38:26,200
- SAUSAGE IS DONE.

1117
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,720
WE NEED MORE PLATES?
- IS THIS YOUR RETIREMENT PARTY?

1118
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,480
[laughter]
- NO.

1119
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,551
- WAIT, ARE YOU PREGNANT,
MOM?

1120
00:38:32,551 --> 00:38:34,657
- THAT'’S A DEFINITE NO.

1121
00:38:34,657 --> 00:38:37,349
- YEAH, THAT WOULD REALLY BE
SOME SURPRISE.

1122
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:39,075
[laughter]
- JOE.

1123
00:38:39,075 --> 00:38:40,939
- JI, GOOD JOB
WITH THE DINNER.

1124
00:38:40,939 --> 00:38:42,043
- THANKS, JOE.

1125
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:44,391
- MOMMY HAS A SURPRISE
FOR NICOLE.

1126
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:46,807
- MUST BE A BABY SURPRISE.

1127
00:38:46,807 --> 00:38:48,464
- MAYBE.

1128
00:38:48,464 --> 00:38:49,982
- MY MOM HAS BEEN
HAVING A SURPRISE FOR NICOLE

1129
00:38:49,982 --> 00:38:51,467
FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS NOW.

1130
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:53,054
SHE HAS A LITTLE NURSERY
GOING ON.

1131
00:38:53,054 --> 00:38:56,230
- JUST IN CASE ANYBODY WANTS
TO SLEEP AT NANA'’S HOUSE.

1132
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,958
JUST IN CASE
ANYBODY TRUSTS NANA OVERNIGHT.

1133
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:01,373
- SO I'’M HOPING THIS
CHEERS HER UP,

1134
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:03,341
AND I'’M VERY EXCITED FOR MOM
TO SHOW THIS TO NICOLE.

1135
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,377
- OKAY, READY?

1136
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:06,965
- [gasps]

1137
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:09,623
PRETTY!

1138
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:11,659
- THIS IS YOUR NEW ROOM.

1139
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:14,041
- NICOLE, IS THAT--REMEMBER
THE TIGER YOU WANTED TO GET?

1140
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,319
- YEAH.
- YOU LIKE IT?

1141
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:17,941
- I LOVE IT.

1142
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:21,186
I'’M DEFINITELY THANKFUL
AND VERY, VERY HAPPY THAT,

1143
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:23,775
YOU KNOW,
JANICE DID THIS NURSERY.

1144
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:25,397
THIS IS SO NICE.

1145
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,330
- COME ON, LEELEE.
- SO THEY COULD SLEEP OVER.

1146
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:29,815
- BUT RIGHT NOW,
MY HEART'’S RACING.

1147
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:31,507
MY STOMACH IS HUGE.

1148
00:39:31,507 --> 00:39:33,129
I'’M OVER BEING PREGNANT.

1149
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:34,579
I JUST WANT
TO HAVE HIM ALREADY,

1150
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:36,477
BECAUSE I CAN'’T TAKE
FEELING LIKE THIS ANYMORE.

1151
00:39:50,353 --> 00:39:53,045
- WHERE'’D YOU GO?

1152
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:55,807
WHAT'’S THE MATTER?

1153
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,015
WHAT'’S THE MATTER?

1154
00:39:57,015 --> 00:39:59,397
- [crying]
I JUST DON'’T FEEL GOOD.

1155
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,814
- WHAT'’S THE MATTER?

1156
00:40:02,814 --> 00:40:05,264
- I CAN'’T BREATHE.
I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

1157
00:40:05,264 --> 00:40:10,442
- WHERE WERE YOU JUST NOW?
- UPSTAIRS.

1158
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:13,411
I JUST DON'’T FEEL GOOD.

1159
00:40:16,344 --> 00:40:19,417
I'’M SO OVER THIS.

1160
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:26,458
- I DON'’T FEEL GOOD.

1161
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,115
I'’M SORRY, BUT I CAN'’T SIT
IN THE CAR FOR AN HOUR.

1162
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:29,979
I HAVE NO ENERGY,
MY STOMACH HURTS,

1163
00:40:29,979 --> 00:40:31,739
AND I JUST NEED
TO GET HOME AND REST,

1164
00:40:31,739 --> 00:40:32,844
BECAUSE
I JUST DON'’T FEEL RIGHT.

1165
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:35,225
BABE!
I'’M SCARED!

1166
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,504
- WHAT?
- I THINK MY WATER BROKE.

1167
00:40:37,504 --> 00:40:38,988
- I'’M NOT READY FOR THIS.

1168
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:40,265
- MY WATER BROKE.

1169
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:42,267
- WHAT!
YOU'’RE LYING.

1170
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:44,200
- I SWEAR TO GOD.
- IT'’S EARLY.

1171
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,409
- NEXT TIME YOU SEE ME,
I'’LL BE IN SCRUBS, ALL RIGHT?

1172
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:47,928
- I'’M JUST SCARED.
I REALLY DON'’T WANT TO TALK.

1173
00:40:47,928 --> 00:40:49,447
PLEASE DON'’T MAKE ME TALK.

1174
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,172
- YOU'’RE GONNA BE FINE, HON.
- THIS IS IT.

1175
00:40:51,172 --> 00:40:53,174
- YOU'’RE MAKING ME
SO STRESSED.

1176
00:40:53,174 --> 00:40:54,659
I DON'’T LIKE IT.

1177
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:56,281
- YOU'’RE GONNA BE FINE.
