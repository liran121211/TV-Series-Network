00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,561
GET SOME COLOR.

340
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:09,047
IT'’S GOOD VITAMINS
IN THE SUN.

341
00:11:09,047 --> 00:11:10,566
- OH, [bleep].
BIG DRAGONFLY.

342
00:11:10,566 --> 00:11:13,224
- GOD, I HATE ALL [bleep]
LIVING CREATURES.

343
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:16,054
- THIS IS LIKE A [bleep]
PETTING ZOO AROUND HERE.

344
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:17,469
- I FEEL LIKE WE'’RE IN MAINE
RIGHT NOW,

345
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,955
WITH ALL THE BUGS
IN OUR BACKYARD.

346
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:21,266
- I'’M EXCITED.

347
00:11:21,266 --> 00:11:23,372
I HAVEN'’T BEEN UP THERE
SINCE DAD'’S SURGERY.

348
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,754
IT'’LL DEFINITELY BE
A NICE LITTLE NEEDED VACATION.

349
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:27,583
I WANT TO, UM,

350
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:29,343

351
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:31,483
'’CAUSE HE'’LL NEVER TELL ME
THE TRUTH OVER THE PHONE.

352
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,141
MY DAD, UNFORTUNATELY,
HAD A HEART ATTACK

353
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:35,418
AND HAD TO HAVE
A QUADRUPLE BYPASS.

354
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:37,179
BUT, YOU KNOW,
TOTALLY DIFFERENT,

355
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:38,698
GOING UP THIS TIME
TO ENJOY IT,

356

EVERYTHING UP THERE WE NEED.

- WHAT DO YOU NEED
HOOCHIE OUTFITS FOR?

363
00:11:52,573 --> 00:11:54,334
- I DON'’T KNOW--YOU NEVER KNOW
IF YOU NEED A HOOCHIE OUTFIT.

364
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:55,542
- THERE'’S NO CLUBS
UP THERE, BABE.

365
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:56,612
THERE'’S NO--

366

367
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:02,238
- THERE'’S ONE RESTAURANT.

368
00:12:02,238 --> 00:12:04,551
- I DON'’T WANT TO PUT ALL
THE PRESSURE ON BETTY COOKING.

369
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:05,966
- YOU CAN COOK AT CAMP.

370
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:09,487
IT'’S NOT GONNA BE
ANYTHING DU JOUR,BUT...

371
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:10,971
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT DU JOURMEANS?

372
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:13,698

- DU JOUR.
- O-U-R?

377
00:12:20,567 --> 00:12:22,672
- "AVAILABLE AND BEING SERVED
ON THE DAY."

378
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:24,053
- YEAH, WHAT'’S UP?

379
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:25,296
- THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH FANCY.

380
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,746
- I WAS PRETTY [bleep] CLOSE.

381
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,437
- WE ALL KNOW DU JOUR
IS PART OF FOOD.

382
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:29,679
- YOU DIDN'’T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS,
'’CAUSE YOU HAD TO GOOGLE IT.

383
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,991
SO SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

384
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:32,406
- YEAH, BUT I WANTED TO MAKE
SURE IT WAS ACCURATE.

385
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:33,614
SO THAT MEANS "OF THE DAY."

386
00:12:33,614 --> 00:12:35,237
- I DATE YOU FOR YOUR
INTELLIGENCE, CLEARLY...

387
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:36,479
- NOT FANCY.

388
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,687

IT MIGHT PUT SOME IDEAS
IN THERE.

408

GET MARRIED.

410

00:21:42,749 --> 00:21:45,373
- THAT MEANS IT'’S A COCKROACH.
THEY DON'’T DIE.

678
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:47,098
I'’M DEFINITELY CURIOUS
TO KNOW WHERE

679
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,721
THE COCKROACH QUEEN IS,

680
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:51,586
BECAUSE WHEN YOU SEE ONE,
THERE'’S, LIKE, A BILLION MORE.

681
00:21:51,586 --> 00:21:53,104
SO I WONDER WHERE
THAT BITCH IS.

682
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,141
SHE'’S PROBABLY SOMEWHERE IN
BETWEEN TWO CRACKS IN THE WOOD.

683
00:21:55,141 --> 00:21:56,660
- I'’M NOT SURE THAT'’S TRUE
WITH COCKROACHES.

684
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,075
- IT'’S WHAT THEY DO

685
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:01,423
IN THE COCKROACH-KILLING
COMMERCIALS.

686
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:04,012
- OH, THAT'’S WHERE YOU GET
YOUR INFORMATION FROM?

687
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:05,634
SAY NO MORE.

688
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:07,015
- CAN WE GO
TO A HOTEL, PLEASE?

689
00:22:07,015 --> 00:22:09,328
I DON'’T WANT TO DO THIS.
I DON'’T LIKE BUGS.

00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:14,885
[knock at door]

691
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:16,058
- COME IN.

692
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:17,301
- GOOD MORNING, GUYS.

693
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:18,992
- HEY.
- HOW YOU DOING?

694
00:22:18,992 --> 00:22:20,442
HOW YOU FEELING?
- GOOD.

695
00:22:20,442 --> 00:22:21,754
- ALL RIGHT,
DID YOU HAVE A GOOD NIGHT?

696
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:23,342
GOOD SLEEP?

697
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,722
- WELL, WE'’RE GETTING THERE.
- YOU GETTING THERE?

698
00:22:24,722 --> 00:22:26,414
- HE WAS REALLY BAD LAST NIGHT.
- I DIDN'’T.

699
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:27,967
I WAS UP LAST NIGHT.

700
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:30,038
LIKE, HE WAS CHANGED.
WE TRIED FEEDING HIM.

701
00:22:30,038 --> 00:22:31,142
AND HE WAS JUST SCREAMING,
LIKE--

702
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,558
- RIGHT.
- FOR HOURS.

703
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:34,353
- NOTHING. IT'’S NORMAL.
- YEAH. NO, I'’M JUST SAYING--

704
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,182
- HOPEFULLY THE BABY DOES ALL
OF ITS SCREAMING AND CRYING

705
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:37,494
HERE NOW
AND WHEN YOU GO HOME,

706
00:22:37,494 --> 00:22:39,737
THE BABY WILL SLEEP
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

707
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:41,394
ALL RIGHT?
BUT THAT'’S ALL NORMAL.

708
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,569
ALL RIGHT, SO I'’M GONNA DO

709
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,087

I'’LL GIVE YOU INSTRUCTIONS

OF ALL THAT.

00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:52,681
HE'’S GONNA THANK ME.

EIGHTH-GRADE DANCE.

00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:11,873
- OH, BOY.

723
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:13,633
- I'’LL BE BACK
IN A FEW MINUTES, GUYS.

724
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:14,979

- WOULD IT BE BAD IF WE PUT
SOME KIND OF, LIKE,

734
00:23:30,063 --> 00:23:31,582
- IS THAT A REAL QUESTION?

735
00:23:31,582 --> 00:23:33,791

A BABY WITH THAT MUCH HAIR,

AND YOU CAN'’T STYLE IT?

00:33:06,881 --> 00:33:08,158
AND SEE HOW FAR
WE CAN PUSH HIM,

1017
00:33:08,158 --> 00:33:10,091
WHERE ROGER FEELS AWKWARD.

1018
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:11,851
I DON'’T FEEL AWKWARD,
'’CAUSE I'’M READY.

1019
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:14,095
NOW I JUST NEED A RING.
- [laughs] YOU BETTER HURRY UP.

1020
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:15,062
- YEAH.

1021
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:22,103
WHY IS THAT PIECE OF PAPER,
"MARRIAGE,"

1022
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:23,518
SO IMPORTANT?

1023
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:25,037
- I'’M GETTING MUSHY HERE,

1024
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:26,590
BUT, UM, IT--IT--

1025
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,283
YOU DON'’T NEED A PIECE OF PAPER
TO LOVE SOMEBODY.

1026
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:30,939
I ALREADY LOVE JENNI.

1027
00:33:30,939 --> 00:33:32,251
- OH, THANK YOU.

1028
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:33,632
AND I LOVE YOUR DAD.

1029
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:36,083
- WITHOUT YOU HAVING A P--
IF--IF YOU--

1030
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,222
IF YOU TWO--

1031
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:38,257
- YOUR NOSE IS GROWING
A LITTLE BIT.

1032
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:40,535
- NO. NO.
- [laughing]

1033
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:42,365
- YOU COULD SAY TO JENNI,
"YEAH, YEAH,"

1034
00:33:42,365 --> 00:33:44,298
YOU KNOW, "I'’M HAPPY WITH YOU,
I LOVE YOU,

1035
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:45,954
AND I WANT TO STAY
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH YOU,"

1036
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:50,028
BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY DO IT
KIND OF OFFICIALLY--

1037
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,995
- IT'’S MORE THAN JUST WORDS.

1038
00:33:51,995 --> 00:33:53,686
- UH, LET'’S PUT IT THIS WAY.

1039
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:56,448
THERE'’S ONE PERSON
IN THIS ROOM THAT WOULD--

1040
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:59,140
WOULD BE VERY,
VERY EXCITED TO HEAR

1041
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,452
THAT YOU TWO
WERE GONNA GET MARRIED.

1042
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:01,867
- NO, YOU CAN MAKE THAT TWO.

1043
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:03,110
- THAT'’S RIGHT,
BUT I DIDN'’T--

1044
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:06,630
- YOU CAN MAKE IT THREE.
- [laughs]

1045
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,287
- SO, UH...
- ANYWAY.

1046
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:09,771
- ANYWAY.
- LET'’S CHANGE THAT SUBJECT.

1047
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:10,979
I THINK WE'’VE--

1048
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:12,326
- HOW DID YOU RAISE HIM?

1049
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:13,568
- [laughs]

1050
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,536
ALL RIGHT,
READY TO HIT THE HAY?

1051
00:34:15,536 --> 00:34:16,778
I COULD THINK
OF A THOUSAND ARGUMENTS

1052
00:34:16,778 --> 00:34:18,056
AGAINST GETTING MARRIED,

1053
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,368
BUT MY DAD GAVE ME
TWO OR THREE REALLY GOOD ONES

1054
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:21,576
FOR IT, YOU KNOW.

1055
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:23,682
- SORRY WE GOT HERE
SO LATE.

1056
00:34:23,682 --> 00:34:26,616
- NO, WE'’VE BEEN EXCITED
TO SEE BOTH OF YOU.

1057
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:28,514
- YEAH.
WASN'’T JUST MY SON.

1058
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:29,550
- [chuckles]

1059
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,552
- MAYBE MY...

1060
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,519
MAYBE MY FUTURE
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.

1061
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,003
- YEAH, WELL...

1062
00:34:35,003 --> 00:34:38,214
- [laughs]

1063
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:41,665
- MAYBE IN--
MAYBE IN MY LIFETIME.

1064
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:42,942
- OH, NOT IN MINE?

1065
00:34:42,942 --> 00:34:44,082
- [laughs]
I'’M JUST KIDDING.

1066
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,532
- OH!

1067
00:34:46,532 --> 00:34:48,569
I'’M TRYING TO HOLD IN THERE.

1068
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:49,811
- I'’M SURE ONE DAY
DOWN THE ROAD,

1069
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:51,641
I'’M GONNA HAVE KIDS
OR GONNA BE MARRIED,

1070
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:53,953
SO TALKING ABOUT IT
DOESN'’T UPSET ME AT ALL.

1071
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:55,541
I JUST WOULD LIKE IT
TO BE DONE.

1072
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:56,887
I WOULD LIKE MY BIG RING.

1073
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,649
- WAIT, WAIT.

1074
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:02,617
- YEAH, REMEMBER WHEN I USED
TO WEAR THESE WHEN I WAS A KID?

1075
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:03,998
- TYPICALLY, AT HOME,
I JUST SLEEP

1076
00:35:03,998 --> 00:35:05,172
IN MY SPIDER-MAN UNDEROOS.

1077
00:35:05,172 --> 00:35:07,967
BUT, UM, I FEEL LIKE
THAT MIGHT BE

1078
00:35:07,967 --> 00:35:09,486
A LITTLE TOO MUCH
FOR BETTY TO HANDLE

1079
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:10,591
AT THIS POINT
IN HER LIFE--

1080
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:11,695

AROUND THE HOUSE

1081

HANGING OUT.

1082
00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:14,595

1083
00:35:14,595 --> 00:35:15,906
- WHAT?

1084
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,598
IT'’S TOO MUCH FOR YOU
TO HANDLE.

1085
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:19,669
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1086
00:35:19,669 --> 00:35:21,843

1088
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:26,089
- JACKPOT.
- YOU LOOK LIKE A ROBBER.

1089
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:27,228
- I AM A ROBBER.

1090
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:28,816
I'’M GONNA ROB
YOUR VIRGINITY.

1091
00:35:28,816 --> 00:35:30,093
[bed squeaking]

[laughing] STOP.

00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:34,339
IT JUST BROKE.
WE JUST BROKE THE BED.

1095
00:35:37,549 --> 00:35:39,689
- THERE'’S MORE SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW
ON THE WAY.

1096
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:41,760
- AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

1097
00:35:45,522 --> 00:35:46,903

TO LET YOU KNOW

1098
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:48,974
THAT DR. KENNEDY IS GONNA SEND
THE BABY HOME.

1099

CONGRATULATIONS.
I'’M SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.

1102
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,567
- I'’M EXCITED
TO LEAVE THIS PLACE,

1103
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:58,017
BECAUSE I WAS KIND OF ANNOYED
AT THE FACT

1104
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:00,192
THAT THE NURSE WAS CHANGING
HIS DIAPER

1105
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:01,538
AND BATHING HIM,

1106
00:36:01,538 --> 00:36:03,782
BECAUSE I WANTED TO LEARN
HOW TO DO THAT STUFF.

1107
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:06,198
SO, GOING HOME, I'’M GONNA BE
DOING ALL OF THAT,

1108
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:08,131
AND THAT'’S WHAT A MOMMY
SHOULD BE DOING.

1109
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:10,271
OKAY, MOM,
CAN YOU PUT THAT DOWN

1110
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:13,171
AND TAKE A PICTURE

- I'’M GETTING UPSET.

1122
00:36:31,568 --> 00:36:33,639
- OKAY, MOMMY,
GRAB THE BABY.

1123

COME ON, I'’LL TAKE ONE
WITH YOU AND--YOU AND--

GONNA BE DOING THIS.

IT'’S NOT A TOY.
- WHY ARE YOU SO GRUMPY?

TO HAPPEN AT MY HOUSE.

00:38:51,087 --> 00:38:53,123
- JENNI LEFT YOU THAT,
A LITTLE NOTE.

1185
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,229
- AW.

1186
00:38:55,229 --> 00:38:57,990
[burps]
AW.

1187
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,028
SHE GOT HIM
A LITTLE BRACELET.

1188
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:03,133
SHE GOT ME A NECKLACE.

1189
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,756
I LOVE JENNI.

1190
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:07,137
LORENZO--
HE'’S FINALLY HERE.

1191
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:09,450
WE'’RE A COMPLETE FAMILY.

1192
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,762
- I'’M NOT THINKING
ABOUT PARTYING.

1193
00:39:10,762 --> 00:39:12,108
I'’M NOT THINKING
ABOUT NOTHING.

1194
00:39:12,108 --> 00:39:13,937
IT'’S AMAZING HOW YOUR MIND-SET
CHANGES SO FAST.

1195
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:14,973
- MM-HMM.

1196
00:39:14,973 --> 00:39:16,112
NOW WHAT?

1197
00:39:16,112 --> 00:39:17,769
- [laughs]

1198
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:21,600
- LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THAT SPIDER RIGHT THERE.

1199
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,567
- [screams]
- [laughs]

1200
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:23,775
- I'’VE GOT A SPIDER

1201
00:39:23,775 --> 00:39:25,328
THAT IS STARING AT ME
AND WANTS TO EAT ME.

1202
00:39:25,328 --> 00:39:26,640
JUST GET ME OUT OF THE BOAT.
GET ME OUT OF THE BOAT.

1203
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,917
- LOOK AT THE SIZE OF IT.
- GET ME OUT OF THE BOAT.

1204
00:39:27,917 --> 00:39:30,713
[Lorenzo farts]
- OH, MY GOD.

1205
00:39:30,713 --> 00:39:33,785
HE JUST [bleep] ON MY LEG.
- HA HA!

1206
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:36,201
- HE'’S SUCH A TINY BABY,
BUT HE FARTS LIKE A GROWN MAN.

1207
00:39:36,201 --> 00:39:38,203
[Lorenzo farts]
UGH.

1208
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:39,273
- DINNER'’S READY.

1209
00:39:39,273 --> 00:39:40,723
- BEAR BALLS.
- I MADE YOU BEAR BALLS.

1210
00:39:40,723 --> 00:39:42,069
- THEY LOOK DELICIOUS.
- YOU GOTTA TRY '’EM.

1211
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:43,588
- OH, MY GOD, I'’M EATING
A BEAR'’S TESTICLE.

1212
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:46,349
- TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

1213
00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:48,144
- DID ROGER POP
THE QUESTION?

1214
00:39:48,144 --> 00:39:49,939
- OH, DON'’T EVEN GO THERE.

1215
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:52,907
NICOLE KEEPS ASKING
IF ROGER'’S PROPOSED YET.

1216
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:55,151
HE DID NOT,
AND STOP [bleep] ASKING.
