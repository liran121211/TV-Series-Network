00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,181
- AAH!
WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT?

176
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,451
AAH!
- BABE, BRING HIM IN CLOSER!

177
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:24,885
- NO!
I CAN'T BRING IT IN!

178
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,454
[laughs]
- IT'S A BASS.

179
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:30,123
- [laughs]
- EASY WITH THE ROD TIP!

180
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,358
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

181
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:33,060
- THAT'S THE FIRST CATCH
I'VE EVER HAD!

182
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,728
- MRS. "I GO FISHING
ALL THE TIME."

183
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,129
- I SAID I NEVER CAUGHT
ANYTHING BEFORE.

184
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,865
- OH, MY GOD.

185
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:39,867
SHE'S LIKE, "THERE'S SOMETHING
ON THE END OF MY LINE."

186
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,034
AND THEN SHE'S--
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GONNA

187
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,770
THROW THE FISHING ROD
IN THE WATER, YOU KNOW?

188
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,071
THAT'S THE POINT.

189
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,706
YES, IT'S--THAT'S A FISH
ON THE END OF YOUR LINE.

190
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:46,874
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.

191
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,175
- OH, LET HIM GO.
HE'S CUTE.

192
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,477
- I'M GONNA LET HIM GO.

193
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,344
- HI. I GOT YOU!
- I'M GONNA LET HIM GO.

194
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,981
- HI, BUDDY.
[claps]

195
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:56,584
- GOOD JOB, BABY.
GOOD JOB.

196
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,786
- THAT WAS FUN.
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.

197
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,521
- [laughs]
CHECK THAT OUT.

198
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,155
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THAT SPIDER RIGHT THERE.

199
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,792
- [gasps]
- [laughs]

200
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:05,959
- I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

201
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:06,960
I'M NOT GONNA
JUMP OUT OF THE BOAT.

202
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,095
- LOOK AT THE SIZE OF IT.

203
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,498
THAT THING IS MONSTROUS.

204
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,265
- WE HAVE TO GIVE LORENZO
A BATH.

205
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,501
- ALL RIGHT.

206
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:16,003
BATHING YOUR SON
FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT'S SCARY.

207
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:17,404
- HE LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GONNA PEE.

208
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,607
PLEASE DON'T PEE
ON MOMMY.

209
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,709
- DINNER'S READY.
I MADE YOU BEAR BALLS.

210
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,210
YOU GOTTA TRY 'EM.

211
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,745
- OH, MY GOD,
I'M EATING A BEAR'S TESTICLE.

212
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,647
- TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

213
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,116
- WOW. YEAH.
IT TASTES LIKE A BALL.

214
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,520
[upbeat music]

215
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,021
- [laughs]
CHECK THAT OUT.

216
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:35,723
LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF THAT SPIDER RIGHT THERE.

217
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:38,358
- [gasps]
- [laughs]

218
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:39,426
- I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

219
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,528
I'M NOT GONNA JUMP
OUT OF THE BOAT.

220
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:41,529
- LOOK AT THE SIZE OF IT.

221
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,063
THAT THING IS MONSTROUS.

222
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,264
LOOK IT IN THE EYE.

223
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:45,533
WE'RE GONNA
BEAT YOUR FEAR TODAY.

224
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,167
- NO!

225
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,401
I GOT A SPIDER NEXT TO ME

226
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,538
THAT IS, LIKE, THE GARGANTUAN
OF ALL SPIDERS,

227
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:51,739
LIKE, STARING AT ME.

228
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,707
IT WANTS TO EAT ME,
BUT I WILL NOT COMPLAIN.

229
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,308
I WILL NOT MAKE HIM
TURN AROUND THE BOAT

230
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,077
AND PROVE THAT I
CANNOT HANDLE THIS,

231
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,912
SO I'M GONNA SUCK IT UP
AND DEAL WITH HIM.

232
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,681
- OH, THE SPIDER'S
ON THE MOVE.

233
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:01,915
- CHARLOTTE, STOP MOVING.

234
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,651
I'M NAMING THE SPIDER
CHARLOTTE,

235
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,719
'CAUSE SHE HAS A BIG WEB.

236
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,588
EW, EW.
DON'T [bleep] WITH ME.

237
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,856
YOU KNOW, I'M BASICALLY
TELLING CHARLOTTE

238
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:10,190
TO GO [bleep] HERSELF.

239
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,559
"IF YOU STAY ON YOUR SIDE,
I'LL STAY ON MINE."

240
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,561
BUT EVERY TIME THE BOAT
WOULD VIBRATE,

241
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,829
CHARLOTTE WOULD, LIKE,
CRAWL UP AND DOWN THE WEB

242
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,198
AND BE LIKE,
"WHAT'S GOOD?"

243
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:23,070
[groans and laughs]

244
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,606
SO, WE'RE, LIKE, INCHES AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER AT THIS POINT,

245
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,775
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S GONNA ATTACK.

246
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:28,942
- IT WAS MORE LIKE FEET,
BUT...

247
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,144
- INCHES, AT ONE POINT.

248
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,781
- MAYBE EVEN YARDS.

249
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:40,120
- * IN THE FACTORY,
I DREAM *

250
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,656
**

251
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:46,059
*THIS METALLIC DISEASE *

252
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,360
* *

253
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,262
- YOU THINK THAT
AIR CONDITIONER'S BOTHERING HIM,

254
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:50,363
BLOWING THIS WAY?

255
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,331
- YEAH.

256
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,303
- JIONNI, YOU NEED HELP?

257
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,271
- NO.

258
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,980
- [bleep]!

259
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,616
- OH, GOD!

260
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,984
- I GO TO TAKE OUT
THE SCREEN,

261
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,519
AND [bleep] DUST
FLIES EVERYWHERE.

262
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,922
LIKE, THE JABRONI THAT I AM,
DIDN'T SHUT THE THING OFF.

263
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,925
THE FIRST THING I THINK OF IS,
COVER LORENZO'S FACE.

264
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:18,926
- [groans]

265
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:20,694
ASS[bleep].

266
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,295
JIONNI, OH, MY GOD.

267
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,298
- SORRY, BUDDY.

268
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,367
- HOLY [bleep].

269
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,703
- DON'T--DON'T--DON'T!
WHAT?

270
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:30,904
- [laughs]
DID YOU SEE THE WEB?

271
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:31,939
- NO.

272
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,306
- DO YOU SEE
ALL THE, LIKE,

273
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,075
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF DOTS
AROUND IT?

274
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,644
- IS THAT--IS THAT BABIES?

275
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:37,778
- THOSE ARE LITTLE SPIDERS.

276
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,512
- OH, [bleep] ME
IN THE ASS[bleep] RIGHT NOW.

277
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,148
NO, THIS IS NOT OKAY.

278
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:42,315
- I THOUGHT YOU LOVED NATURE.

279
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,251
- I [bleep] HATE SPIDERS.
- [laughs]

280
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,686
- I WANT TO FISH.

281
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,454
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT
CALM, COOL, COLLECTED,

282
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,957
AND MY ANXIETY'S UP THERE,
DUE TO THE FACT

283
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:53,493
THERE'S ABOUT 1,000 BABIES
AND A 2-INCH WOLF SPIDER.

284
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,527
- SO, WAIT A MINUTE.

285
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,797
FISHING IS CALM,
COOL, AND COLLECTED?

286
00:09:56,797 --> 00:09:58,198
- [screams]

287
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,967
- YOU GOT HIM! REEL HIM IN.
REEL HIM, BABE, REEL HIM.

288
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,568
- [screams]
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO!

289
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:02,770
IT'S FIGHTING ME!
YOU TAKE IT!

290
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,772
- NO. REEL IT IN.
DON'T DROP THAT ROD.

291
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:05,973
- I WAS A LITTLE
TAKEN ABACK.

292
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,074
- I THOUGHT
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

293
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:08,375
CALM, COOL,
AND COLLECTED THOUGH?

294
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,542
- UP UNTIL THE POINT
YOU CATCH A FISH.

295
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,778
- OH. GOT YOU.

296
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,279
- AAH! OOH!

297
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,881
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HANDING IT OFF.

298
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:14,848
KEEP IT AWAY
FROM THE MOTOR.

299
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:15,849
- [laughs]

300
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:16,984
[screams]

301
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,285
- THAT'S A GOOD-SIZED ONE.

302
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,452
GOD, YOU'RE SO TERRIFIED.

303
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,790
I MEAN, LIKE,
YOU'RE LIKE, "AAH!"

304
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,859
- OOH, OOH.
STOP FLAPPING, HOMEY.

305
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,494
WE'RE GONNA LET YOU GO.

306
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:29,096
- IT'S NICE.

307
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,563
- HELLO.

308
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,065
- IT'S A GOOD-SIZED FISH,
BABY.

309
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,834
- BYE, BABE.
- [grunts]

310
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,435
MY BABY'S NAILIN' EM.
YOU DON'T EVEN GIVE ME TIME

311
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,237
TO GET MY FRIGGIN' HOOK
IN THE WATER.

312
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:38,205
I THINK
IT'S BEGINNER'S LUCK.

313
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:39,439
- WHAT?

314
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,640
- IT'S ABSOLUTELY
BEGINNER'S LUCK.

315
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,442
- HOW IS
ANYTHING BEGINNER'S LUCK?

316
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,878
DO I HAVE SOMETHING?
- WHAT IS IT?

317
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,680
- DID I CATCH SOMETHING?

318
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,048
OH, IT'S FIGHTING ME!
IT'S PISSED OFF!

319
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,316
- NO, GET IT.
KEEP IT IN THE WATER.

320
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:50,650
- I'M KEEPING IT DOWN

321
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,119
- IT'S A LITTLE ONE.
IT'S A LITTLE ONE.

322
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,420
- I CAUGHT FISH.

323
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,955
- RIGHT, BUT WHERE'S
THE SKILL SET IN THAT?

324
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:57,825
BRING YOUR TIP UP SO IT
COMES UP TO THE SURFACE HERE,

325
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,059
NEXT TO ME,
NOT OUT THERE.

326
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,460
- COME ON, YOU [bleep].

327
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,595
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A SKILL SET.
I CAUGHT FISH.

328
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:05,432
YAY! I GOT THREE!

329
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,500
ME 3. ROGER 0.
- [laughs]

330
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,002
YOU'RE GONNA
RELEASE THIS ONE.

331
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,370
- WHAT?

332
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,106
- YOU'RE GONNA
RELEASE THIS ONE.

333
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:15,743
- COME AGAIN?

334
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:16,977
HOW DO I HOLD IT?

335
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,178
- JUST LIKE I AM.

336
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,512
- EW, I CAN'T DO IT.
I CAN'T.

337
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,381
I'M GONNA THROW UP.
I WANT TO HOLD IT LIKE THAT.

338
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,216
- NO, YOU CAN'T, 'CAUSE
THAT'S NOT THE PROPER WAY.

339
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,753
- OH, GOD, I'M, LIKE,
FREAKING OUT. I REALLY CAN'T.

340
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,454
- YOU POKE WITH YOUR FINGER IN
AND JUST GRAB IT LIKE THIS.

341
00:11:27,454 --> 00:11:30,223
WATCH. JUST THIS SIMPLE.
JUST, BOOM, LIKE THAT.

342
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,224
- THEY HAVE LITTLE TEETH.

343
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,760
THE FISH HAVE LITTLE TEETH,

344
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,027
AND WHEN YOU PUT YOUR HAND
IN THERE, YOU FEEL THEM,

345
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,495
AND IF YOU PRESS TOO HARD,

346
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:36,797
I FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE GONNA HURT IT.

347
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:37,898
I DON'T LIKE
HURTING ANIMALS.

348
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,032
- GRAB IT.

349
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,467
- LET ME HOLD THE BELLY
FIRST, SO I CAN--

350
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,769
- I'LL PUT IT IN THE NET,
AND YOU PICK IT OUT OF THE NET.

351
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:45,072
- NO, LET ME--

352
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,306
OH, HI.

353
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,607
- YEAH, WATCH WHEN IT KICKS
WHAT HAPPENS.

354
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,876
IT HASN'T KICKED YET.

355
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:51,845
- YAY! I THREW IT IN
MY WAY.

356
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:52,846
- JENNI DEFINITELY BEAT ME.

357
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,782
UM, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE

358
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,349
TO HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME
TO ACTUALLY FISH

359
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,119
RATHER THAN TAKING
ALL THE FISH OFF HER LINES,

360
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,520
BUT, NO, SHE DID BEAT ME.

361
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,922
SHE DID REALLY WELL.

362
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:04,191
GOOD JOB, BABY.

363
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:07,027
- UH-OH.
I'M STUCK.

364
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,796
- I LOVE THE SMELL OF MUD
IN THE MORNING.

365
00:12:08,796 --> 00:12:10,263
- NEW JERSEY AND MAINE

366
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,965
ARE, LEGIT,
TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS.

367
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:13,400
- OH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
SEE HIM?

368
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,268
- EW, EW, SOMETHING
WAS SQUISHY RIGHT THERE.

369
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,370
WHAT IS THAT?
- [laughs]

370

372
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,680
- YOU LIKE IT OUT HERE?

373
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,449
- I LOVE IT OUT HERE.

374
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:32,820
I WANT YOU TO BUILD
A HOUSE OUT HERE.

375
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,287
- I WANT TO BUILD
A HOUSE OUT HERE.

376
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:38,158
JENNI, DESPITE THE SCREAMING
AND MAYBE BEING A LITTLE TIRED,

377
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,827
SHE STILL HASN'T COMPLAINED,
AND, YOU KNOW,

378
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,461
I GOTTA TAKE MY HAT OFF
TO HER, YOU KNOW?

379
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,030
I-I DON'T KNOW THAT
I WOULD HAVE SAID THAT

380
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,464
EARLY IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

381
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,899
WE GOTTA LEAVE SOON, BABE.

382
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,235
- I'M GONNA TRY NICOLE.
- COOL.

383
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,669
[phone rings]

384
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,172
- HEY. HOW'S MAINE?

385
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,640
- IT'S AMAZING.

386
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,178
WE'RE OUT AT, UM, ROGER'S CABIN
RIGHT NOW WITH, UH,

387
00:12:58,178 --> 00:13:00,247
NO ELECTRICITY
OR RUNNING WATER,

388
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,149
AND IT RUNS OFF...
- GOD.

389
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,651
- PROPANE AND A GENERATOR,
SO IT'S REALLY COOL.

390
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:05,953
IT LOOKS LIKE A...
- DOESN'T SOUND COOL.

391
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:09,089
- YOU KNOW, LIKE A LOG CABIN
OUT ON A MILE-LONG LAKE.

392
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:11,724
BUT I JUST CAUGHT
THREE BASS FISH.

393
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,861
- WOW.
- WHO ARE YOU?

394
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,095
NO ELECTRICITY.

395
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,663
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT SHE'S DOING UP THERE.

396
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:19,366
SHE'S TOTALLY
OUT OF HER ELEMENT, I FEEL.

397
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:22,870
- I AM VERY RELAXED RIGHT NOW
AT THIS CABIN.

398
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,371
AND WE'RE ABOUT
TO GO CLAMMING.

399
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:26,639
- SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

400
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,076
- AT LEAST JIONNI
CAN APPRECIATE IT.

401
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:32,312
- YEAH, MR. SURVIVOR MAN
OVER THERE.

402
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,881
- HELL YEAH.

403
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,883
- DID ROGER POP THE QUESTION?

404
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:36,984
- WHAT'D SHE SAY?

405
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,685
- SHE ASKED IF YOU
POPPED THE QUESTION.

406
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,553
- [laughs]

407
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:41,889
- I WAS REALLY HOPING
THAT NICOLE

408
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:43,790
WOULD NOT ASK IF ROGER
POPPED THE QUESTION IN MAINE,

409
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,325
BUT I KNEW IT WAS COMING.

410
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,626
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.

411
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:47,594
I KNOW IT'S NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

412
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:50,563
THEREFORE, WHY ASK?

413
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:53,233
- OKAY.

414
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:54,667
WHY DO YOU ASK SO MUCH?

415
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,370
- I DON'T ASK.
- OKAY.

416
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,506
GUESS THAT DEPENDS
ON WHAT QUESTION.

417
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,174
- HE GOES,
"DEPENDS ON WHAT QUESTION."

418
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,911
- "WILL YOU MARRY ME?"

419
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:06,046
- NO.
- YES, I WILL, NICOLE.

420
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,780
- CRICKET.
- UH-HUH.

421
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,583
- JIMINY.
- BYE, ASS[bleep]S.

422
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,819
- BYE.

423
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:16,156
I THOUGHT I MADE A FUNNY,
AND I DIDN'T.

424
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,193
- YOU'RE REALLY
DOING YOUR MAKEUP RIGHT NOW?

425
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,330
[grunts]

426
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,331
LIKE, REALLY?

427
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,532
TO GO CLAMMING?

428
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,834
- AN EYELASH WAS BLOWING OFF.

429
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,769
- I DON'T THINK
THE CLAMS CARE

430
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,773
IF YOUR EYELASH FALLS OFF.

431
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:35,775

00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,549
- HEY, DEENA.
- HELLO?

434
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:46,153
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
- NOTHING. WHAT'S UP?

435
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:49,822
- NOTHIN'. I JUST WANTED TO CALL
AND SEE HOW YOU WERE FEELING.

436
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:52,059
- GOOD.
JUST RELAXING RIGHT NOW.

437
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:55,862
- YEAH, UM, I WANNA KNOW,
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' TOMORROW?

438
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:59,232
- UM, PROBABLY NOTHING.

439
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,500
- I WANNA COME OVER,

440
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,635
AND I WANNA SEE THE BABY,
AND I WANNA SEE YOU.

441
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,771
- I KNOW.
HE'S SO CUTE.

442
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:06,573
HE SLEEPS A LOT, THOUGH,

443
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,241
SO HOPEFULLY HE'LL BE UP
WHEN YOU'RE HERE.

444
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,977
- IT'S GONNA BE A LOTTA FUN.

445
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,311
- OKAY, I LOVE YOU.
I'LL TEXT YOU.

446
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,812
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY, BYE.

447
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,315
- LOVE YOU TOO. BYE.
- COOL.

448
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:19,252
WE HAVE TO GIVE
LORENZO A BATH.

449
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,488
CAN'T WAIT
TO WASH HIS HAIR.

450
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,555
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT

451
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,757
ANY KIND OF LOTION ON HIM.

452
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,359
- DADDY DOESN'T WANT
TO GIVE YOU A BATH.

453
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,995
- I DIDN'T SAY I DON'T
WANT TO GIVE HIM A BATH.

454
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:29,362
I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT THE NURSE TOLD ME.

455
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,764
YOU DIDN'T GO TO ONE BATH
THAT SHE GAVE HIM.

456
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,034
- I KNOW, BUT WHY WOULD IT
BE BAD TO GIVE HIM A BATH?

457
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:35,702
- SHE SAID IT'S NO GOOD
FOR HIS SKIN

458
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:36,803
TO HAVE A BATH EVERY DAY.

459
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,071
- SO WHY'D SHE DO IT
EVERY DAY?

460
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,139
- BECA--I HAVE NO IDEA.

461
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:40,507
- I WANT TO GIVE LORENZO
A BATH TODAY

462
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:42,109
BECAUSE I THINK
HE SMELLS LIKE CHEESE

463
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,743
AND HIS HAIR LOOKS GREASY

464
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,279
AND HE JUST LOOKS
KIND OF DIRTY.

465
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,380
LIKE, I KIND OF WANT TO--

466
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,815
- HE DIDN'T SMELL
LIKE CHEESE.

467
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,650
- YEAH, HE DID.

468
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,586
AND WHEN I WAS A BABY,
I HATED BATHS,

469
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:57,624
SO THIS MIGHT
BE TORTURE FOR YOU.

470
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:00,493
- IT'S SCARY, BATHING YOUR SON
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

471
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:03,030
HE'S SO LITTLE.
I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.

472
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,065
YOU WANT TO BE SO CAUTIOUS.

473
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:07,700
HE'S SO FRAGILE,
IT--IT'S SCARY.

474
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,705
- OKAY, MAKE YOU
NICE AND CLEAN.

475
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,908
GET BEHIND YOUR EARS.

476
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:18,745
HE LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GONNA PEE.

477
00:16:18,745 --> 00:16:21,048
PLEASE DON'T PEE
ON MOMMY.

YOU'RE CLEAN!

YOU KNOW, NINE MONTHS AGO,

481
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,358
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD
BE TAKING CARE OF MY SON.

482
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,826
DOES THAT FEEL GOOD?
HE LOVES IT.

483
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,762
IT JUST MAKES ME
FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF,

484
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,430
AND I KNOW THAT I'M GONNA
BE A GOOD MOM,

485
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,200
AND I DEFINITELY
DON'T DOUBT MYSELF ANYMORE.

[kisses]

487
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:44,104
YOU DID SUCH A GOOD JOB.

00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,073
HE'S SUCH A G.

489
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,908
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

OH, GOD, HE'S HUNGRY.

HE'S LOOKING FOR A [bleep].

- YOU ALL RIGHT?

496
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,354
- IT'S EARLY.

497
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,556
YOU KNOW, EARLIER THAN JENNI
NORMALLY GETS UP.

498
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,292
UM, IT'S ABOUT 5:00
IN THE MORNING.

499
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,094
- I'M COMPLETELY OUT OF IT
RIGHT NOW.

YOU FEEL BETTER?

- [laughs]
STOP.

- ARE YOU AWAKE NOW?

503
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,301
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- YOU LIKE OYSTERS?

504
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:16,303
- OVERCOME YOUR FEARS.
COME ON.

00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:17,637
- I'M GONNA EAT A RAW CLAM

506

RIGHT NOW.

I HOPE YOU SEE
A WORM OUT HERE THOUGH.

OH, I REALLY HOPE
YOU SEE A BLOOD WORM.

CAN I GOOGLE THEM?

00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:34,954
- I SWEAR BLOOD WORMS
ARE REAL,

515
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,923
AND IT'S NOT GOING
TO ATTACK YOU.

516
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,525
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THEY BITE.

517
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,527
- IF YOU PICK IT UP WITH
YOUR BARE HAND, IT'LL BITE YOU.

518
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,129
IT'S, LIKE,
A CENTIPEDE-LOOKING THING.

519
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,530
- YEEH.

520
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:48,335
**

521
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:51,204
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THOSE?

522
00:17:51,204 --> 00:17:53,406
- KILLING BLOOD WORMS
WITH THEM.

523
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,974
- YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS?

524
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,443
COME ON, JENNI.
- YES.

525
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:57,944
- WHAT ARE YOU SERIOUSLY
DOING WITH THOSE?

526
00:17:57,944 --> 00:17:59,146
- BRINGING--WHOOPS!
[laughs]

527
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:00,247
- YOU CAN'T EVEN WALK
IN SNEAKERS,

528
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,548
AND YOU'RE GONNA WALK
IN THOSE?

529
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,883
- [laughs]

530
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,618
ARTHUR!

531
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,987
- HEY!
- YO!

532
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:08,988
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HI.

533
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,457
- P.J., JESUS.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

534
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:11,524
- IT'S BEEN TOO LONG, MAN.
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN, BROTHER?

535
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,592
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'VE BEEN GOOD.

536
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,793
- GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

537
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,061
- HOW WAS THE RIDE?

538
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,197
- IT WAS--UH, WE--WE TOOK
A FEW WRONG TURNS,

539
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,798
BUT WE MADE IT.

540
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:20,333
- AH, THEY LOOK LIKE GOOD
[bleep]-KICKING BOOTS.

541
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,634
- SHE GOT THESE
OUT OF THE CAR.

542
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,869
I'M LIKE, "WHAT--
WHAT DO YOU NEED THESE FOR?"

543
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:23,903
- FOR CLAMMING.

544
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,071
- SHE CLAIMS
THAT SHE'S GONNA

545
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,339
BEAT A BLOOD WORM
TO DEATH WITH 'EM.

546
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,007
- HE TOLD ME THERE'S
BLOOD WORMS IN THERE.

547
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,276
- YOU MIGHT SEE A BLOOD WORM.
- EH, THEY'RE PRETTY--

548
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:30,777
- SPIKING IT.
- THEY'RE PRETTY QUICK, THOUGH.

549
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,245
YOU DON'T KNOW.
- YEAH.

550
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:34,714
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY SHE
WOULD EVEN NEED HEELS IN MAINE,

551
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,183
BUT, FOR WHATEVER REASON,

552
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,617
SHE BROUGHT HEELS
TO GO CLAMMING.

553
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,918
IT MAKES NO SENSE.

554
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,721
- MAY I USE THE RESTROOM...
IN THERE?

555
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,491
- ABSOLUTELY.
- WHICH WAY? RIGHT OR LEFT?

556
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,058
- [laughs]
- OUT BEHIND THAT BUILDING.

557
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,196
- ARE YOU LYING?

558
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:50,930
AAH! THE OUTHOUSE?

559
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:53,300
- YEAH. ROLL THAT--
YEAH.

560
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,536
- HE'D BETTER GIVE ME THAT
DAMN RING SOONER THAN LATER.

561
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,605
IT'S GROSS.

562
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:01,474
I FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA VOMIT.

563
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,211
WELL, IS THERE--?

564
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,479
I NEED SOME SORT
OF TOILET PAPER.

565
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,915
[laughs]

566
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:10,750
THE OUTHOUSE IS
A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR ME.

567
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,719
IT'S TOO CONFUSING,
YOU KNOW?

568
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,021
MAY I HAVE PAPER TOWELS?
- WHAT?

569
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:16,489
- FOR TOILET PAPER?

570
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,558
- IT'S IN THE WHITE
PLASTIC TUB.

571
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:19,759
- OH, IT IS?
- YEAH.

572
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:20,993
THAT'S HOW YOU KEEP
THE MICE OUT OF IT.

573
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:21,961
- THAT'S HOW THE MICE
DON'T EAT IT.

574
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,230
YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

575
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,431
- [laughs]
GOD, STOP.

576
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:26,766
I'M NOT GONNA FREAK OUT.

577
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,768
I COME TO FIND OUT
THE TOILET PAPER'S IN THE BIN

578
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:32,372
DUE TO THE FACT THAT MICE
CAN EAT AT IT.

579
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,873
- ALL SET?
- ALL SET.

580
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,242
- [laughs]

581
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:42,715
- UM, SO I JUST...

582
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,785
[laughs]
OH, MY GOD.

583
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:46,986
A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR ME.
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

584
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,255
I CAN HOLD IT.

585
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:50,557
NO.

586
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,360
[exhales]

587
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,027
I'M GONNA HOLD IT.

588
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,963
- ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH, FINE.

589
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,832
I GOTTA PEE.
[laughs]

590
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,033
- I'M GONNA
GO GET MY BOOTS ON

591
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,670
AND GRAB SOME CLAM HOES
AND ROLLERS AND...

592
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,672
- LET'S GO DO THIS.

593
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:07,640
THESE ARE THE GOOD ONES,
'CAUSE YOU DIG IT IN

594
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,775
AND THEN YOU FLIP IT OVER.

595
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,042
- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING?

596
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,579
- IT'S A CLAM HOE,
AND THIS IS A ROLLER,

597
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,047
AND YOUR CLAM
HAS TO NOT FIT THROUGH.

598
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,149
IF A CLAM FALLS
THROUGH THERE, IT'S NO GOOD.

599
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,620
- OKAY.
- TOO SMALL.

600
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,255
- DID YOU GET ALL THAT?
- YEAH.

601
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,956
- ALL RIGHT.

602
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,893
- DON'T DOUBT ME. OH, THIS IS
GONNA BE A BACK BUSTER.

603
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:27,927
- WELL, YA AT LEAST GOTTA
GET ENOUGH

604
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,061
TO TAKE HOME
FOR FAMILY DINNER.

605
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,163
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
- [laughs]

606
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,632
- NEW JERSEY AND MAINE

607
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,567
ARE, LEGIT,
TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS.

608
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,503
IT'S LIKE GOING
TO A DIFFERENT COUNTRY.

609
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:40,340
UH-OH.
[exhales]

610
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,477
I'M STUCK.

611
00:20:44,477 --> 00:20:48,247
- I LOVE THE SMELL OF MUD
IN THE MORNING.

612
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,750
- I ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT
BRINGING MY HIGH HEELS OUT HERE.

613
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,084
HUH...

614
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,153
- HOW ARE YOU DOING,
MY LOVE?

615
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,989
- UM, I'M ATTEMPTING,
YOU KNOW?

616
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,125
- I WAS TALKING TO P.J.
- OH.

617
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,861
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
I WOULDN'T DO FOR ROGER,

618
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,463
BUT CLAMMING
IS LEGIT EXHAUSTING,

619
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,765
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO, LIKE,
STAY ABOVE THE MUD

620
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,799
SO YOU DON'T GET STUCK.

621
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,436
EVERY [bleep] STEP YOU TAKE
IS HARD.

622
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,770
THEN YOU'VE GOT TO FIND
A LITTLE HOLE,

623
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,771
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO DIG

624
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,440
AND DIG AND DIG AND DIG,

625
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,674
AND THEN YOU CLAM
THE WRONG WAY--

626
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:15,842
UGH! IT'S A WORM!

627
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:17,344
AND YOU MIGHT GET BIT
BY A BLOOD WORM.

628
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,611
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

629
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,813
THIS IS A WORKOUT.

630
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,849
IT'S A LOT OF EFFORT
JUST FOR A [bleep] CLAM.

631
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,050
- THERE YOU GO.

632
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,752
OOH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
SEE HIM?

633
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:27,487
SEE HIS HEAD RIGHT THERE?
- OH, NO, IT LOOKS LIKE A WORM!

634
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:28,721
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN DO THIS.

635
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:31,157
I CAN'T DO IT.
[gasps]

636
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,359
- KEEP GOING.
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

637
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,660
- I CAN GET IT!

638
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,762
- NICOLE DIDN'T WHINE THAT MUCH
GIVING BIRTH.

639
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:37,430
- I'M FREAKING OUT.
YOU GET IT.

640
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,831
- NO.
- [laughs]

641
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,368
- EW, EW, SOMETHING WAS SQUISHY
RIGHT THERE. WHAT IS THAT?

642
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:42,835
- [laughs]

643
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:44,236
- OH, WHAT WAS THAT?

644
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,638
OH, COME ON NOW.

645
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:46,873
- HURRY UP,
BEFORE HE GETS AWAY.

646
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,508
- UH, UH, AAH!
- HURRY UP!

647
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,542
[laughs]

648
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:51,478
- [whimpers]

649
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,680
- [bleep].
I KEEP SPEARIN' 'EM.

650
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,949
- THAT'S A KEEPER.
- YAY, I GOT ONE.

651
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:59,686
- OOH, NOW, YOU--
WELL, YOU'RE UP TO TWO.

652
00:21:59,686 --> 00:22:02,889
- OOH, I GOT A WORM!
AAH! WHAT WAS THAT?

653
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,458
- THERE HE IS.
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

654
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,126
- HOW MANY YOU GOT, BABE?

655
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,995
- NOT DOING WELL AT ALL.

656
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,964
CLAMMING IS--IS PRETTY MUCH
WHAT I REMEMBER IT BEING.

657
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:14,133
IT'S A LOT OF HARD WORK
FOR A LITTLE REWARD.

658
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:17,269
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY MORE CLAM
THAN I'VE GOTTEN

659
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,638
IN A LONG TIME RIGHT NOW.

660
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:21,574
[groans]
EATING ONE RAW?

661
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,776
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- YOU EAT 'EM RAW?

662
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:24,911
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- YOU LIKE OYSTERS?

663
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:27,547
- ARE YOU--ARE YOU
GONNA CLEAN IT FIRST?

664
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:30,583
- NO, THE OCEAN CLEANS IT.
- YOU TRY IT FIRST.

665
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:35,254
DO YOU CHEW IT?
- OF COURSE YOU CHEW IT.

666
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,423
- THIS IS...

667
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:38,591
[whimsical music]

668
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,326
I NEED A LITTLE
SALT AND PEPPER ON IT.

669
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,161
- OH, BUT YOU EAT SUSHI.
- [laughs]

670
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:43,963
- OVERCOME YOUR FEARS.
COME ON.

671
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,733
- I'LL NEVER LIVE THIS DOWN
IF I DON'T DO IT,

672
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:49,268
AND I CAN'T COMPLAIN,
SO I'M GONNA EAT A RAW CLAM

673
00:22:49,268 --> 00:22:50,803
RIGHT OUT OF THE OCEAN
RIGHT NOW.

674
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:55,442
- IT'S A RAW CLAM.
IT'S NOT A SPIDER.

675
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:59,245
- HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT TEXTURE?
- IT'S NOT VERY GOOD!

676
00:22:59,245 --> 00:23:00,913
- EAT IT, BABY.

677
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,450
- IT'S DOWN.
- GOD LOVE YA.

678
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,618
[laughter]

679
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:08,955
- SO, THERE'S A TECHNIQUE
WHEN IT COMES TO CLAM EATING.

680
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:11,458
- OH, IS THERE EVER.

681
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,059
- ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE A DOWNEASTER.

682

BEEN EATING CLAM
MY WHOLE LIFE.

00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:21,468
NEVER A COMPLAINT
FROM A CLAM YET.

686
00:23:21,468 --> 00:23:23,335
- EW.

687
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,304

OUT OF YOU YET, DARLIN'.

688
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,574

00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:29,241
- JENNI'S TALKING THE TALK
AND WALKING THE WALK, YOU KNOW?

00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,943
I MEAN, SHE'S--
SHE'S GETTING IN THERE.

691
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,079
SHE'S GETTING HER HANDS DIRTY.
I'M PROUD OF HER, YOU KNOW?

692
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,515
SHE'S DOING A GOOD JOB
AND NOT COMPLAINING.

693
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:36,549
- [belches]

694
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,950
THAT WAS FUN.

695
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,385
I CAN'T BREATHE.

696
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,353
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING
I'VE NEVER SMELLED BEFORE!

697
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,689
- [laughs]

698
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:45,492
- IT SMELLS LIKE 5,000 FISH
JUST DIED ON THIS BOAT

699
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,694
AND HAVE MARINATING IN THE SUN
FOR, LIKE, A WEEK.

ARE YOU SLEEPING?
- NO.

707
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:01,841
WE SHOULD ENTER
THE DIAPER OLYMPICS.

708

[upbeat music]

709
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,548

715
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,190
IN JERSEY,
EVERYTHING'S FAST-PACED,

716
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,226
WHEREAS IN MAINE,
EVERYTHING'S SLOW-PACED,

717
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,161
AND, YOU KNOW,
MORE HOME COOKING

718
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:25,097

00:25:05,137 --> 00:25:06,405

743
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,340
- IT'S A HIMALAYAN
FLAME POINT.

744
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,042
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

745
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,778

00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,714
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE SUCH

00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:20,386
IT'S EXTREMELY SPECIAL FOR ME
BECAUSE THEY ACCEPT HER.

750
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,121
YOU KNOW, SHE'S JUST LIKE
ONE OF THE FAMILY.

751
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,189
- BEAR BALLS.

752
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,257

757
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,034
- WHEN YOU SAY "BEAR BALLS,"
YOU KNOW,

758
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,969
YOUR FIRST INITIAL REACTION
IS, "OH, MY GOD,

759
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,437
I'M EATING A BEAR'S TESTICLE."

760
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,339
- TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

761
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:43,175
- WOW. YEAH.
IT TASTES LIKE A BALL.

762

769
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:58,024
- SO, BE PREPARED.
- WHAT'S "BAITING THE BAGS"?

770
00:25:58,024 --> 00:26:01,928
- BAITING THE BAGS MEANS
THAT YOU'RE PUTTING THE RAW--

771
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:03,262

- WEAR YOUR
VERY WORST CLOTHES.

778
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:17,276
- DON'T WEAR
ANYTHING YOU LIKE AT ALL.

779
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:18,645
WEAR ROGER'S CLOTHES
OR SOMETHING.

780
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:20,346

- OH, MY GOODNESS.

784
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,319

00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,122
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

788
00:26:31,457 --> 00:26:32,825

[baby crying]

802
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,891
SOMEONE'S SUPPOSED
TO HAVE ENERGY,

803
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:06,192
AND THEN SOMEONE SLEEPS,

804
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:07,694
AND THEN VICE-VERSA,

805
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:08,861
AND WE'RE BOTH EXHAUSTED.

- CRAZY RIGHT NOW.

810
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,736
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

811
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:19,205
I SAID "BACKWARDS DIAPERS."
IT JUST--I NEED TO SLEEP.

00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,887
I'M GETTING UP AT LEAST
FIVE TIMES A NIGHT.

820
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,388
IT'S JUST NON-STOP.

821
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,825
EVERY TIME NICOLE AND I
SAID WE'RE GONNA SWITCH,

822
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:40,526
WE'RE NOT SWITCHING.

823
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,394
IT'S WE'RE BOTH GETTING UP.
WE'RE BOTH NOT GETTING SLEEP.

824
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:44,096
THE WHOLE ROTAT--
EVERYTHING BACKFIRED.

825
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:46,733
YOU SOAKED

THEY--SOMEBODY ELSE EVEN
CLEANS 'EM UP.

00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:56,108
I'M SO TIRED.

832
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,944
- TEAM DIAPER.

833
00:27:57,944 --> 00:28:02,581
- NO ONE CHANGES DIAPERS
BETTER THAN US!

834
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,752
- WE SHOULD ENTER
THE DIAPER OLYMPICS.

839
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,861

HOW MUCH SHOULD WE TIP THEM?

00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,635
- $40 APIECE.

845
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,304

00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,517
- I'M ALL GOOD.
- ALL RIGHT.

852
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,519
- WANT A BOWL OF CEREAL?

853
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,688
- NO.
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

854
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:43,956
IT'S EARLY.

855
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,125
YOU KNOW, EARLIER THAN JENNI
NORMALLY GETS UP.

856
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,960
UM, IT'S ABOUT 5:00
IN THE MORNING.

857
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,262
- THIS LOOKS LIKE
I'M GOING TO WORK.

858
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,298
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE CHANGING PROFESSIONS.

859
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:53,699
YOU GOT LOBSTERS HERE,

860
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,367
AND YOU GOTTA GET UP EVERY
MORNING LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW?

861
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,468
[laughs]

862
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,870
- I LOVE LOBSTER FISHING.

863
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,071
IT'S WHAT I GREW UP DOING,

864
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,940
SO I'M EXCITED.
I'M JUST PUMPED.

865
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,942
THIS WHOLE MAINE TRIP
IS JUST KIND OF

866
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:05,111
GETTING BACK TO, UH,
MY ROOTS, YOU KNOW?

867
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:08,180
- OH, MAN, I'M COMPLETELY
OUT OF IT RIGHT NOW.

868
00:29:10,382 --> 00:29:12,351
- BREAK YO' MOTHER[bleep] SELF!

869
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,153
YOU FEEL BETTER?
- [laughs] STOP!

870
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:15,554
- ARE YOU AWAKE NOW?

871
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,424
- IT'S [bleep] 6:00
IN THE MORNING!

872
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,827
I [bleep] HATE
"BREAK YOURSELF."

873
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:23,629
- WHEN IT STOPS WORKING,
I'LL SWITCH TO SOMETHING ELSE.

874
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:25,464
IT'S STILL WORKING PERFECTLY
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH.

875
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:29,235
- YOU'RE KILLING MY EARS.
- WELL-OILED MACHINE RIGHT NOW.

876
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,538
- MORNING.
- GOOD MORNING.

877
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:33,906
- LET'S HOPE WE'RE BETTER
LOBSTERMEN

878
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,207
THAN WE WERE CLAMMERS.

879
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,843
WHAT'S UP, BROTHER?
WHAT'S GOING ON? ROGER.

880
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:38,878
HOW ARE YOU? THERE YOU GO.
THERE'S YOUR BAIT BUCKET.

881
00:29:38,878 --> 00:29:41,647
YOU WANT TO BE POSTED UP
RIGHT NEAR THAT THING.

882
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:44,483
- TO BE HONEST, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT TO EXPECT

883
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,252
WHEN IT COMES
TO LOBSTER FISHING.

884
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:47,753
I JUST PICTURE
THE DEADLIEST CATCH,

885
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,321
AND THAT SCARES
THE [bleep] OUT OF ME.

886
00:29:49,321 --> 00:29:51,090
- LET'S DO THIS.
I'M READY.

887
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,291
AM I DRIVING OR--?

888
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,260
- OH, NO. NO.
- [laughs]

889
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,329
[upbeat music]

890
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:00,432
* *

891
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:03,502
- HOW ARE YOU DOING?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

892
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:07,039
- I CAN'T BREATHE.
- [laughs]

893
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,208
- VERY PUNGENT.

894
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:13,913
- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO PUT THAT
IN BAIT BAGS, RIGHT?

895
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:16,082
- IT'S LIKE SOMETHING
I'VE NEVER SMELLED BEFORE!

896
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:17,716
- AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN
CLOSE TO IT YET.

897
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:18,750
WAIT TILL YOU GET UP THERE
CLOSE.

898
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,486
- I DON'T HONESTLY
THINK I CAN!

899
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,888
- [laughs]

900
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:24,891
- THE LOBSTER BOAT
JUST SMELLS LIKE DEATH.

901
00:30:24,891 --> 00:30:27,159
IT JUST SMELLS LIKE 5,000 FISH
JUST DIED ON THIS BOAT

902
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,695
AND HAVE BEEN MARINATING
IN THE SUN FOR, LIKE, A WEEK.

903
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:31,363
- BAIT A BAG!

904
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:33,832
- YOU'VE GOT YOUR GLOVES ON.

905
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,969
- STUFF THAT AS FULL AS YOU CAN
AND THEN CINCH IT UP.

906
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:40,206
HURRY UP, THOUGH, 'CAUSE WE'VE
GOT TRAPS COMING ON BOARD.

907
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,908
- OH, GOD.

908
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:43,709
- YOU CAN EAT ONE
IF YOU WANT!

909
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,277
- EHH! GOD.

910
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:49,548
- DUDE, JOE'S GONNA WANT TO HIRE
YOU SO BAD AFTER SEEING THIS.

911
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:51,918
- YOU CANNOT GET RID OF
YOUR SENSE OF SMELL,

912
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:53,585
DUE TO THE FACT
THAT YOU HAVE TO BREATHE,

913
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,022
AND IT WAS JUST, LIKE,
SO [bleep] VILE.

914
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,993
BABE?
- WHAT?

915
00:31:00,993 --> 00:31:02,128
- I GOTTA PEE-PEE.

916
00:31:02,128 --> 00:31:04,696
- YOU GOTTA GO
IN A BUCKET, BABY.

917
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,098
IT'S A LOBSTER BOAT.

918
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:08,400
THERE'S NO BATHROOM ON HERE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

919
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,002
THERE'S YOUR PORTA POTTY.

920
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:12,338
YOU TAKE A BUCKET,
YOU GO UP IN THE FRONT,

921
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:13,772
YOU SIT ON IT, YOU PEE,
YOU COME OUT HERE,

922
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:15,674
YOU THROW IT OVER THE SIDE.

923
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,944
- IS THERE TOILET PAPER?

924
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:19,946
- UM, A PAPER TOWEL,
PROBABLY.

925
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:22,014
- I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING,
EVEN THOUGH, IN MY HEAD,

926
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,416
I'M [bleep] SCREAMING
VIOLENT WORDS.

927
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,085
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DRANK
COFFEE.

928
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:27,954
UHH! THAT IS NASTY.

929
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:30,156
AND THEN, THE BOAT'S SWAYING,
AND YOU'VE GOT TO TRY

930
00:31:30,156 --> 00:31:33,059
AND LEVEL YOURSELF
ON A BUCKET TO GO PEE.

931
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,860
THANK GOD IT WASN'T DARK
IN THERE.

932
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,362
[groans]

933
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:38,697
NOTHING LIKE CARRYING
MY OWN PEE BUCKET.

934
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,266
- MY GOD,
YOU PEED FIVE GALLONS.

935
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,333
DON'T PUT IT
OVER THE BAIT.

936
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,334
YOU DON'T WANT
TO RUIN THE BAIT.

937
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,136
- I HAVE PEED
ON DEENA'S FOOT.

938
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,105
I HAVE PEED
BEHIND KARMA'S BAR.

939
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:47,806
I HAVE PEED
ON PORCH STEPS.

940
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,841
GO [bleep] FIGURE.

941
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,979
- I HEREBY CHRISTEN

942
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:55,114
- THANK YOU.
- GOOD JOB BY YOU.

943
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:57,183
[seagulls squawking]

944
00:31:57,183 --> 00:31:59,618
- OH. OH, YEAH.
BRING IT.

945
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:01,020
- YOU WANT TO GET IN HERE,
BABE?

946
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,488
- GRAB 'EM.

947
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:05,391
- AAH! [bleep],
IT'S HANGING.

948
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:07,159
- GRAB IT. THROW IT IN THERE.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

949
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,660
- AAH!

950
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,396
[whimpers]

951
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:12,698
- GRAB IT.

952
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:14,200
- AS LONG AS YOU GRAB 'EM
RIGHT THERE, YOU'RE GOOD.

953
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,668
- [whimpers]

954
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,438
[groans]

955
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,207
- LOOK AT THAT ONE, BABY.
LOOK AT THAT ONE.

956
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:22,441
- AAH!
- LOOK AT THAT SUCKER.

957
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:24,276
- WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT?
- [laughs]

958
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,613
THAT IS A MONSTER.
- AAH!

959
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,115
- NO, GO AHEAD.
WE'LL LOOK AT HIM AFTER.

960
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,882
FINISH YOUR TRAP.
- [groans]

961
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,085
SO, YEAH,
I'M NOT FEELING THIS.

962
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:34,386
[whimpers]

963
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:36,622
LET GO, LET GO, LET GO.
STOP WAILING.

964
00:32:36,622 --> 00:32:38,890
I DON'T LIKE THIS
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

965
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,060
- GOOD JOB, BABY,
GOOD JOB.

966
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,429
I'M PRETTY PROUD OF HER,
ALL IN ALL.

967
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:44,430
YOU KNOW, SHE'S SCARED
OF THE LOBSTERS

968
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,697
LIKE SHE IS SCARED
OF MOST THINGS,

969
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,333
BUT SHE STILL GOT IN THERE
AND SHE STILL DID IT,

970
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,667
SO, YOU KNOW,
WHAT MORE COULD I ASK FOR?

971
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:51,037
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

972
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:53,439
WELL, I HAD FUN.
THANK YOU FOR COMING WITH ME.

973
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,774
- OVERALL, LOBSTER FISHING
IS DEFINITELY

974
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:57,043
FOR A CERTAIN BREED
OF PEOPLE.

975
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:59,578
YOU'VE GOT TO BE
A CERTAIN THICK SKIN TO DO IT,

976
00:32:59,578 --> 00:33:02,181
SO I GIVE PEOPLE PROPS
FOR BEING LOBSTERMEN.

977
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,183
GOT IT?
- YEP.

978
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:06,552
- I'M WASHING ALL OUR CLOTHES
WHEN WE GET BACK.

979
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:07,686
EVERYTHING STINKS.

[pop music]

981
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,490
MY BODY SMELLS LIKE DEATH.

[belches]

983
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:14,326
- TELL ME THAT'S NOT BEAUTIFUL
OUT THERE, THOUGH,

984
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,963
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- IT'S GORGEOUS.

985
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,798
UM, AND THEN--

986
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:21,567
- BREAK YO' MOTHER[bleep] SELF!

987
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:23,835
- WILL YOU JUST [bleep]
STOP WITH THAT?

988
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,404
STOP. JUST STOP.

989
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,073
- I HAD A GUN.
- I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING.

990
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:29,575
- [laughing]
I HAD A GUN THIS TIME.

991
00:33:29,575 --> 00:33:31,577
IT WASN'T EVEN LOADED,
I SWEAR.

992
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:32,578
BREAK YOURSELF!

993
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:34,280
- STOP!

994
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,116
- *AH, GO ON *

995
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:39,851
* YOU'RE CALLING ME
AT HOME *

996
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,322
- OH, THERE'S BUGS.
- YOU'RE OKAY. COME ON.

997
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:47,559
- PUT YOUR FEETIES UP
SO THE SWELLING GOES DOWN.

998
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:51,330
- MY LITTLE BURRITO.

999
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,633
[phone rings]

1000
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,102
HELLO?

1001
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:57,136

1002
00:33:57,136 --> 00:34:00,106

HEY, BOO.

1003
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:01,873
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

1004
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,610
- I'M JUST LAYING OUTSIDE
WITH LORENZO.

1005
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,612
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

1006
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:09,248
- WE JUST GOT DONE
LOBSTER FISHING

1007
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,449
EARLY THIS MORNING.

1008
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:14,786
WE GOT UP AT, LIKE,
5:00 TO GO AND, UM,

1009
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,688
I DIDN'T GET
MUCH SLEEP LAST NIGHT

1010
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:19,258
'CAUSE WE WERE AT
HIS AUNT'S HOUSE FOR DINNER,

1011
00:34:19,258 --> 00:34:22,494
AND SHE COOKED BEAR BALLS
AND, LIKE--

1012
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:25,397
- WAIT.
DID YOU SAY "BEAR BALLS"?

1013
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,134
- YEAH.
- NASTY.

1014
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,701
SHE'S EATING BEAR BALLS.

1015
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:32,804
- BEAR TESTICLES?
- LIKE, BEAR TESTICLES.

1016
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,140
- ARE THEY GOOD?

1017
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,908
- HOW'S ROGER'S FAMILY?

1018
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,244
- THEY'RE GOOD.

1019
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,379
- SO, YOU'RE, LIKE,
MEETING ALL OF HIS FAMILY,

1020
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:44,150
MAYBE HE'S THINKING
ABOUT PROPOSING.

1021
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,384
IT'S ABOUT TIME
ROGER PROPOSES.

1022
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:47,686
AT THIS RATE,
I THINK I'M GONNA GET MARRIED

1023
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,021
BEFORE JENNI
EVEN GETS ENGAGED.

1024
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,392
- OH, DON'T EVEN GO THERE.
HE'S SITTING RIGHT HERE.

1025
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,561
- I'LL GIVE YOU PRIVACY,
IF YOU WANT.

1026
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:57,829
- WELL, I REALLY HOPE,
LIKE, GENUINELY,

1027
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,331
I HOPE YOU'RE HAVING FUN
UP THERE.

1028
00:34:59,331 --> 00:35:01,167
- YEAH, I AM.
I'M HAVIN' A LOT OF FUN.

1029
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,869
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW
ON OUR WAY BACK.

1030
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,204
- ALL RIGHT, BYE.
I LOVE YOU.

1031
00:35:05,204 --> 00:35:06,505
- BYE.

1032
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:08,073
I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE
I WANT TO PUNCH NICOLE

1033
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:09,408
RIGHT IN THE [bleep] NOSE

1034
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,943
'CAUSE SHE KEEPS ASKING
IF ROGER HAS PROPOSED YET.

1035
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,513
HE DID NOT,
AND STOP [bleep] ASKING.

1036
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:16,482
- IT'S SO WEIRD.

1037
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,450
- THE BEAR BALLS
WAS ENOUGH FOR ME.

1038
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,718
I MEAN, UGH!

1039
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:22,188
- AUNTIE JENNI
ATE BEAR BALLS.

1040
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:24,856
THAT'S FRICKIN' WEIRD.

1041
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:29,928
- THERE'S MORE SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW
ON THE WAY...

1042
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,264
- AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

1043
00:35:32,264 --> 00:35:36,368
- * SO FAR, SO FAST *

1044
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:39,405
* SOME THINGS
AREN'T MEANT TO LAST *

1045
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:41,540
- ARE YOU EXCITED
FOR THE FURNITURE?

1046
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,974
I CAN'T WAIT.

1047
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,945
IT'S GONNA FINALLY
LOOK LIKE A BABY'S ROOM.

1048
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:49,047
- DOES HE HAVE [bleep]
IN HIS NAILS?

1049
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:50,582
- NO, IT'S DRIED BLOOD.

1050
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:52,484
- IT'S YELLOW.

1051
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:55,254
HAVE YOU BEEN
PICKING YOUR BUTT?

1052
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:58,990
- BELLINI TRUCK'S HERE.

1053
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,726
LET'S GO GET
OUR FURNITURE.

1054
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:03,128
- HOW ARE WE GONNA CARRY
ALL THAT [bleep] DOWNSTAIRS?

1055
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,596
- THEY ARE.
- OH.

1056
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:05,697
- THINK I'M DOING IT?

1057
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,999
- YAY! IT'S HERE.

1058
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,069
I AM SO EXCITED
THAT THE FURNITURE IS HERE,

1059
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,771
BECAUSE NOW WE GET TO SET UP
OUR NURSERY.

1060
00:36:12,771 --> 00:36:15,641
LORENZO'S HERE.
LIKE, PERFECT TIMING.

1061
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:17,743
- HOW DO YOU
WANT THIS SET UP?

1062
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:19,511
- THE CRIB'S
DEFINITELY GONNA GO THERE.

1063
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,512
- OKAY.

1064
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,947
- UM, THE BOOKCASE--

1065
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:23,249
- HEY, HEY,
I HAVE A [bleep] SAY.

1066
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,683
- OH, SORRY. "THE BOSS"
GOTTA LOOK TOO.

1067
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:25,717
- I'M SORRY.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

1068
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,253
- OKAY. WHAT?
- RIGHT?

1069
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:29,054
- WHAT, YOU WANT THE ARMOIRE
RIGHT THERE?

1070
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:30,989
- WHAT'S AN ARMOIRE?

1071
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,459
- THE ARMOIRE'S, YOU KNOW,
THE LARGER DRESSER

1072
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:34,960
WITH THE OTHER DOORS ON IT.

1073
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,696
- THE ARMOIRE?
SAY "THE BUREAU'S COMING."

1074
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,064
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT THE CRIB.

1075
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,667
YOU GOT THE, YOU KNOW,
CHANGING TABLE.

1076
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:42,668
YOU GOT THE BOOKSHELF.
- THE BOOKSHELF.

1077
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:43,735
- THE CHAIR.
- OUR CHAIR.

1078
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:46,872
- IT'S JUST WEIRD.

1079
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,308
JUST DON'T SAY "ARMOIRE"
IN MY BASEMENT,

1080
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:50,742
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

1081
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,644
- HOW MUCH
SHOULD WE TIP THEM?

1082
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:57,483
- $40 APIECE.
- OKAY.

1083
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:59,585
OR WE COULD GIVE THEM
ICE POPS.

1084
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:00,719
- [laughs]

1085
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,388
- WE HAVE A LOT
OF ICE POPS.

1086
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,290
- HERE YOU GO.
THIS IS FOR YOU GUYS.

1087
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,457
TAKE THAT. THANK YOU.
APPRECIATE IT.

1088
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:08,193
- THANK YOU.
PEACE BE WITH YOU.

1089
00:37:08,193 --> 00:37:11,297
- AFTER THIS FURNITURE'S IN,
YOU LOOK OVER,

1090
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:12,598
IT LOOKS LIKE
AN ACTUAL BABY'S ROOM.

1091
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:13,865
- OH, THAT'S NICE.

1092
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,367
- IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE
A HOME DOWN HERE.

1093
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:18,637
- WOW, LET'S SEE.

1094
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:19,671
- IT'S NICE.

1095
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:22,541
- WOW.
IT LOOKS GOOD.

1096
00:37:22,541 --> 00:37:25,311
LORENZO'S ALL SET, MAN.

1097
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:26,712
- THIS IS IT.
NOW WE'RE NOT LEAVING.

1098
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:29,114
- OH. WAIT,
DON'T MAKE IT TOO GOOD.

1099
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:32,017
YOU GUYS COULD STAY
FOREVER.

1100
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:34,386
[upbeat music]

1101
00:37:34,386 --> 00:37:35,521
- LET'S DO THIS.

1102
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,489
* *

1103
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,326
- BETTY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO
SHOPPING IN THE WINERY WITH ME?

1104
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:42,561
- CERTAINLY.
I WOULD LOVE TO.

1105
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:44,162
- SO, ROGER'S GONNA
STAY BEHIND

1106
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,331
TO HANG OUT WITH HIS DAD,

1107
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:48,133
AND ME AND BETTY
ARE GONNA GO WINE TASTING.

1108
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,701
WE'RE "THE PINK TEAM."

1109
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,803
I FEEL LIKE THE BOYS
NEED THE BOY TIME

1110
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,472
AND THE GIRLS
NEED THE GIRL TIME.

1111
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,709
- YEAH, THIS IS WHERE
I ALWAYS LIKED IT.

1112
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,244
RIGHT OFF--
RIGHT ALONG IN THERE.

1113
00:37:59,244 --> 00:38:01,347
- THAT'S REALLY GOOD
IN THE SPRING.

1114
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:02,981
- THERE'S A LOT OF NESTS
THERE.

1115
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:05,951
- NOT SO GOOD NOW?
- WELL, IT MAY STILL BE.

1116
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,190
- I THINK WE'RE, UH,
GONNA HEAD BACK IN THE MORNING,

1117
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,526
BUT I'M GLAD WE GOT--
GOT TO COME UP

1118
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,027
AND SPEND SOME TIME,
YOU KNOW?

1119
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,397
- IT MEANT A LOT TO ME
WHEN YOU GUYS COME UP AND--

1120
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:19,931
- I TRIED
TO PUT JENNI THROUGH

1121
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,401
EVERY MAINE THING
THERE IS TO DO

1122
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:23,502
WHILE WE WERE UP HERE,
YOU KNOW?

1123
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:24,703
- YEAH.
MAKE HER A MAINE GIRL.

1124
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,638
- DOES SHE GET THE MAINE STAMP
OF APPROVAL?

1125
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:29,240
- SHE'S BEEN--SHE'S BEEN, UH,
APPROVED, YES.

1126
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,076
- I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS, THINGS, UH,

1127
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:33,379
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING
REALLY WELL LATELY, AND...

1128
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,480
- GOOD.

1129
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,382
- YOU KNOW, UM,
I THINK I'M READY TO

1130
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:38,417
AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE IT
TO THAT NEXT STEP,

1131
00:38:38,417 --> 00:38:41,920
WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS,
YOU KNOW, GETTING ENGAGED,

1132
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,222
AND IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I'VE DEFINITELY

1133
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:45,857
PUT SOME SERIOUS THOUGHT
INTO LATELY,

1134
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,693
AND I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE
JENNI'S THE GIRL FOR ME, SO--

1135
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:49,628
- GOOD.
- YOU KNOW?

1136
00:38:49,628 --> 00:38:50,962
- I'LL TELL YOU, YOU TWO--

1137
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,764
- I WANT TO MAKE SURE MY FAMILY,
UH, AGREES WITH ME.

1138
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:54,533
YOU KNOW, THAT'S ALL.
- I AGREE WITH YOU.

1139
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:55,834
I SEE THE CHANGE IN YOU

1140
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,503
THAT NO OTHER GIRL
HAS EVER DONE TO YOU.

1141
00:38:57,503 --> 00:38:58,804
- MM-HMM.

1142
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:00,939
- AND YOU CERTAINLY KNOW JENNI
BETTER THAN I DO,

1143
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:04,676
BUT WHAT--WHAT WE KNOW
OF JENNI, WE LOVE HER.

1144
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,277
YOU COULDN'T FIND
A NICER GIRL.

1145
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,046
- I'M NOT
A SUPER EMOTIONAL GUY,

1146
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:11,082
BUT IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE
YOUR DAD'S STAMP OF APPROVAL.

1147
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,718
YOU KNOW,
IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

1148
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:16,021
- YOU TWO SEEM TO BE RIGHT
FOR EACH OTHER.

1149
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:17,989
I MAY BE JUMPING THE GUN,

1150
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:20,692
BUT I-I CONSIDER HER
PART OF OUR FAMILY NOW.

1151
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,462
I MEAN, SHE'S A SWEETHEART
AND WE LOVE HER,

1152
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:28,333
AND, UH, YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
BE REAL HAPPY TOGETHER.

1153
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:29,668
- *'CAUSE IT'S OUR TURN,
BABE *

1154
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:33,304
* AND WE'RE GONNA LEARN
TO DO THIS RIGHT *

1155
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:38,677
* YEAH, I'M SORRY
THAT IT'S TAKEN YEARS *

1156
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:43,114
* I NEVER WANTED
TO FEEL LIKE THIS *

1157
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,816
* READY OR NOT *

1158
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,118
* HERE I COME *

1159
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:52,057
- JUST TO THINK,
HE WAS IN YOUR BELLY

1160
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,725
THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE
IN THE SHORE HOUSE.

1161
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,127
- OH, MY GOD.
HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

1162
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,996
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS YOUR BABY.

1163
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:59,531
- OH, YEAH.
WE'RE LOBSTER TIME.

1164
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:01,232
- YOU CAUGHT 'EM.
YOU GOTTA PUT 'EM IN.

1165
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,468
- WHAT?
GET OUT OF HERE.

1166
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,803
I'M NOT LISTENING
TO THEM SCREAM.

1167
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,071
- [laughs]

1168
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,138
- [sighs]

1169
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:10,008
LOBSTERS DO NOT SCREAM
WHEN BOILED.

1170
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:13,344
- THEY DON'T SCREAM.
- THEY "EEK." EEEEH!

1171
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,847
- IT'S OKAY.
IT'S ALL BETTER NOW.

1172
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,983
YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY
WITH YOUR MOMMY, RIGHT?

1173
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:19,217
JUST ME AND YOU?

1174
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,853
- YOU LOVE MOMMY, RIGHT?
DADDY'S ANNOYING, RIGHT?

1175
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:25,290
KEEP TALKING TO HIM,
'CAUSE HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.
