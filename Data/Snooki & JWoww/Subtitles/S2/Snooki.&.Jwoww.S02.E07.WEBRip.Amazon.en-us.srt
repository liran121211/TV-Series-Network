DOESN'’T EVEN KNOW HER.

520
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:58,585
- I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'’RE SAYING JENNI.

521
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:02,417
HOWEVER, I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU
HAVE A MOTHER WHO YOU LOVE.

522
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:04,867
AND YOU LOVE HER TO THIS DAY,
I KNOW THAT YOU DO.

523
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:07,491
SO IT'’S NOT LIKE
SHE'’S JUST SOME FORGOTTEN PERSON

524
00:19:07,491 --> 00:19:08,802
THAT WE DON'’T SPEAK OF.

525
00:19:08,802 --> 00:19:10,114
EVERY TIME
YOU SPEAK TO YOUR MOM,

526
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:11,426
WHICH IS PRETTY REGULAR,
YOU TELL HER

527
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:12,496
YOU'’RE COMING TO SEE HER.

528
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:13,911
SO IS THAT EVER
ACTUALLY GONNA HAPPEN?

529
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:16,189
- SOON.
- OKAY.

530
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,743
- SOON WHEN I'’M MENTALLY ABLE
TO GO THERE

531
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:20,193
AND THEN D--HAVE ENOUGH TIME

532
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,574
TO DEAL WITH IT
WHEN I GET OUT OF THERE.

533
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:22,575
- OKAY.

534
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:23,748
IT'’S A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION.

535
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:25,405
IT'’S A DELICATE SITUATION.

536
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:27,959
I'’M NOT GOING TO PRESSURE HER
IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.

537
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:31,100
I'’M COMFORTABLE MEETING HER MOM
WHEN JENNI'’S COMFORTABLE

538
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,619
INTRODUCING ME TO HER MOM,
YOU KNOW?

539
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:37,314
IT'’S CLEAR TO ME IT HAS A LOT OF
EMOTIONAL MEANING TO YOU.

540
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:40,213
SO IF YOU'’RE THAT ADAMANT
ABOUT IT, JENNI,

541
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:43,872
THEN--THEN THAT'’S FINE.
- NO, I GET THAT.

542
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,704
- YOU--YOU THINK
THERE WILL EVER BE A POINT

543
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:52,639
WHERE YOU'’RE COMFORTABLE
WITH ME MEETING HER OR NO?

544
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:57,299
- [laughs]

545
00:19:57,299 --> 00:19:58,404
[gags]

546
00:19:58,404 --> 00:19:59,370
- PLEASE DON'’T THROW UP.

547
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,958
I'’M BEGGING YOU, PLEASE.

548
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,373
- YOU'’RE EATING A TONGUE.

549
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:03,995
I DON'’T THINK THERE'’S ANYTHING

550
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,067
THAT JENNI WON'’T PUT IN HER
MOUTH BESIDES ROGER'’S [bleep].

551
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:13,557
- DO YOU THINK
THERE'’LL EVER BE A POINT

552
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:15,731
WHERE YOU'’RE COMFORTABLE
WITH ME MEETING HER OR NO?

553
00:20:15,731 --> 00:20:18,009
- MAYBE.

554
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,012
I DON'’T MIND
PEOPLE MEETING MY MOTHER.

555
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,532
- I'’M JUST CURIOUS WILL THAT
DAY--WHEN WILL THAT DAY EV--

556
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:26,570
WILL IT EVER COME
OR NEVER COME?

557
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,297
- I'’M SURE IT'’LL COME.

558
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:31,022
I WILL SEE HER.

559
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:33,232
I'’VE NEVER SET A DATE
FOR MY MOM TO SEE HER.

560
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,543
I'’VE ALWAYS SAID
I WOULD BE UP THERE.

561
00:20:34,543 --> 00:20:35,820
- SOON?

562
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,684
- WHEN I'’M COMFORTABLE
WITH SEEING HER.

563
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:39,859
- I UNDERSTAND THAT, SO, AGAIN,

564
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:43,863
NO PRESSURE FROM ME AT ALL.

565
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:45,244
I'’M SURE IT'’S TOUGH.

566
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,384
I'’M--I'’M--I--
- NOBODY GETS THAT.

567
00:20:47,384 --> 00:20:50,697
- IT'’S COMPLETELY UP TO JENNI
WHEN WE DO THIS, YOU KNOW?

568
00:20:50,697 --> 00:20:52,458
SO I'’M COMFORTABLE WITH IT

569
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,942
WHEN JENNI'’S COMFORTABLE
WITH IT, YOU KNOW?

570
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:57,428
YOU DON'’T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
ANYTHING FURTHER TO M--TO ME.

571
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,154
I-I UNDERSTAND.

572
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:00,224
- THANK YOU.

573
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:01,536
- NO PROBLEM.

574
00:21:01,536 --> 00:21:03,538
- [kisses]
LOVE YOU.

575
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:05,022
- I LOVE YOU.

SOME DAY WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO MAKE THIS FOR OUR SON.

581
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,146
I'’M GONNA BLINDFOLD YOU

582
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:27,389
AND YOU'’RE GONNA TRY
EVERY ONE OF '’EM.

PLEASE?

585
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:33,084
- OKAY, BUT YOU ALSO.

586
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,948
- NO, IT'’S NOT FUNNY.

587
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:36,191
- JIONNI!

588
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:37,848
- IT'’S ONLY FUNNY IF YOU DO IT.
- NO!

589
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,470
I'’M GETTING A BLINDFOLD.
YOU'’RE A BULLY.

590
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,403
I WANNA TEST BABY FOOD
BECAUSE I KNOW

591
00:21:41,403 --> 00:21:42,887
IT GETS RECALLED ALL THE TIME.

592
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:43,923
- WELL, YOU'’RE GETTING
BLINDFOLDED.

593
00:21:43,923 --> 00:21:45,614
- WELL, SO ARE YOU.
- OKAY.

594
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:48,445
- AND I WANNA KNOW, LIKE,
HOW BAD THE [bleep] TASTES.

595
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:50,136
AND I WANT JIONNI
TO KNOW HOW BAD IT SUCKS.

596
00:21:50,136 --> 00:21:54,071
WATCH MY EYELASHES!
- WHAT?

597
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:56,453
YOU CAN SEE.

598
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:58,317
- I CAN'’T SEE [bleep].

599
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,113
- OKAY, LET'’S SEE
WHICH ONE YOU LIKE THE BEST.

600
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,908
- DON'’T GIVE ME A LOT.

601
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:05,945
- ONLY ONE?

602
00:22:05,945 --> 00:22:07,187
- YEAH.
- OR TWO?

603
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:08,534
- JUST ONE!

604
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:10,777
- NICOLE IS GONNA
HAVE A TASTE OF SOME CORN,

605
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:12,745
SOME MASHED POTATOES,
SOME GABAGOOL.

606
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:14,229
I'’M MIXING EVERY ONE OF THESE.

607
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:17,197
- [giggles]

608
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,064
[gags]
- PLEASE DON'’T THROW UP.

609
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:23,514
I'’M BEGGING YOU, PLEASE.
PLEASE.

610
00:22:23,514 --> 00:22:25,205
- TOO BAD.
- PLEASE.

611
00:22:25,205 --> 00:22:26,552
ARE YOU CRYING?

612
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:28,277
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

613
00:22:28,277 --> 00:22:31,833
AND WE'’RE GONNA
FEED OUR KID THIS?

614
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:34,145
- I DON'’T EVEN THINK
BABIES HAVE TASTE BUDS,

615
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,630
BECAUSE IF THEY WERE
TO EAT THIS,

616
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,079
I THINK THEY WOULD
ALL THROW UP.

617
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:39,392
THAT WAS SO BAD.

618
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:40,462
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

619
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:42,464
IT DOESN'’T EVEN TASTE LIKE FOOD.

620
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:44,017
UGH!

621
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:48,574
YOUR TURN.

622
00:22:48,574 --> 00:22:49,816
- DO YOU KNOW
LITTLE KIDS EAT THIS

623
00:22:49,816 --> 00:22:51,680
AND WE'’RE ACTING LIKE BABIES?

624
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,406
- IT TASTES LIKE [bleep].

625
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,615
JIONNI!

626
00:22:55,615 --> 00:23:00,068
I'’M GONNA DO
WHAT YOU DID TO ME.

627
00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:01,966
[laughs]

628
00:23:01,966 --> 00:23:05,349
- OH, GOD.

629
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:06,350
OH, MY GOD.

630
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,697
OH, MY GOD, IT'’S DISGUSTING.

631
00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:10,009
- I KNOW.

632
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:11,390
- WHICH ONE DID YOU DO?

633
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,943
- THESE TWO.
- YOU MIXED?

634
00:23:12,943 --> 00:23:14,254
- LIKE YOU DID.

635
00:23:14,254 --> 00:23:15,808
- ALL RIGHT, CAN I TELL YOU
WHAT I REALLY GAVE YOU?

636
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:17,396
- WHAT?
- I GAVE YOU ALL OF THEM.

637
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:21,400
- YOU'’RE AN [bleep].

638
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,642
IT TASTES LIKE [bleep].

639
00:23:22,642 --> 00:23:24,989
- I'’M GONNA THROW UP.

640
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:29,856
- ♪ I WAS WALKING
DOWN THE STREET ♪

641
00:23:29,856 --> 00:23:34,240
♪ KEPT SHUFFLING,
SHUFFLING MY FEET ♪

642
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,070
- IT'’S JEWISH.

643
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,797
- WHAT'’S JEWISH FOOD
TASTE LIKE?

644
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:41,350
IT TURNS OUT
IT'’S A JEWISH RESTAURANT,

645
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,318
AND IT'’S DEFINITELY
A DIFFERENT PLACE.

646
00:23:43,318 --> 00:23:45,009
- OH, WHAT'’S THAT?

647
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:46,942
- IT'’S A COLESLAW
AND THE SOUR PICKLES.

648
00:23:46,942 --> 00:23:48,081
- WHAT THE [bleep] IS THIS?

649
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:49,945
- WANNA CHEERS?

650
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:51,291
- WHY ARE THEY DIFFERENT COLORS?

651
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:54,260
- ONE'’S A GREEN, ONE'’S A...

652
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,330
- [laughs]

653
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,229
I WANNA KNOW
WHAT A SALTY LOX IS.

654
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,886
- KOSHER SALAMI.

655
00:23:59,886 --> 00:24:01,509
- SEASIDE PLATTERS.

656
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,096
- WHAT IS TONGUE?

657
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:05,064
- ASK HIM.

658
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:06,824
- WHAT KIND OF TONGUE?

659
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:09,793
IS IT JUST CODE WORD FOR
SOMETHING OR IS IT LEGIT TONGUE?

660
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:13,452
- ASK HIM.
- HELLO.

661
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,454
- SHE HAS A QUESTION.
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

662
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,146
- UNDER THE HOLLYWOOD SALAD,
WHAT IS TONGUE?

663
00:24:18,146 --> 00:24:23,047
- TONGUE IS A BEEF TONGUE WHICH
WE TAKE IT AND WE CURE IT.

664
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:24,359
HERE'’S A SAMPLE.

665
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:27,431
- TONGUE?
- YEAH.

666
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:30,192
- SO THAT'’S A COW TONGUE?
I DARE YOU TO TRY IT.

667
00:24:30,192 --> 00:24:32,091
- YOU JUST EAT IT LIKE THIS?

668
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:33,472
- WE MAKE SANDWICHES OUT OF IT.

669
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,507
WE CAN MAKE
A HOT SANDWICH OUT OF IT.

670
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:35,922
- YOU'’RE EATING A TONGUE.

671
00:24:35,922 --> 00:24:39,270
- YEAH, IT'’S GOOD.
- IT ACTUALLY TASTES LIKE HAM.

672
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,927
- UGH.

673
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:42,481
I DON'’T THINK THERE'’S ANYTHING

674
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,344
THAT JENNI WON'’T PUT
IN HER MOUTH AT THIS POINT

675
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:46,519
BESIDES ROGER'’S [bleep].

676
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,488
SO HOW IS ROGER?

677
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,352
- UM, WERE FIGHTING YESTERDAY.
- WHY?

678
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:54,700
- I DIDN'’T REALIZE HOW BIG
OF A [bleep] I WAS BEING.

679
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,116
I WANTED TO PLAN US
TO SEE MY MOM,

680
00:24:57,116 --> 00:24:59,290
AND THEN YESTERDAY
I WAS CHANGING MY MIND.

681
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,948
- BUT DO YOU WANT HIM
TO MEET YOUR MOM?

682
00:25:01,948 --> 00:25:03,156
- OF COURSE HE'’D LIKE TO MEET
HER, BUT HE DOESN'’T WANT TO,

683
00:25:03,156 --> 00:25:05,365
LIKE, PRESSURE ME.

684
00:25:05,365 --> 00:25:06,505
LIKE, "I HAVE TO MEET YOUR MOM."

685
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,127
IT'’S JUST WEIRD.

686
00:25:08,127 --> 00:25:10,474
YOU AND JIONNI
ARE STRESSED OUT?

I'’LL STILL FEEL THE SAME WAY.

OF A LITTLE PERSON.

855
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:03,102
- OH!
- OH!

856
00:31:03,102 --> 00:31:04,690
- PLEASE DON'’T TELL HIM THIS.
- PLEASE.

857
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,829
IT'’S LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING,
YOU KNOW?

858
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:06,968
ANY TIME I LEARN
INFORMATION LIKE THIS

859
00:31:06,968 --> 00:31:08,073
ABOUT JIONNI IS A GOOD DAY.

860
00:31:08,073 --> 00:31:09,074
EXPLAINS YOUR
DANCE MOVES AT LEAST.

861
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:10,006
- [laughs]

862
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:14,458

00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:27,161
- ME?

868
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:28,403
OH, LOOK AT THAT THING.

869
00:31:28,403 --> 00:31:30,578
NO STORK BROUGHT THAT BABY.

870
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:32,891
PATRON BROUGHT THAT BABY
TO THIS PLANET.

871
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,135
- I'’M REALLY EXCITED TO BABYSIT
LORENZO TONIGHT WITH MY BOO.

872
00:31:36,135 --> 00:31:38,275
ALL I GOTTA DO IS BURP HIM,
CHANGE HIM, FEED HIM,

873
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:39,759
AND HE'’S GOOD TO GO.

874
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:41,140
- HEY.

875
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,350
SAME AS HANGING OUT WITH JIONNI.
- [laughs]

876
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,593
- WHAT'’S UP, BROTHER?

877
00:31:45,593 --> 00:31:46,870
WHAT'’S HAPPENING?
- WHAT'’S UP, PAL?

878
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,837
- WHAT'’S GOING ON?
- WHAT'’S GOING ON?

879
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:50,805
- HEY, ROG,
PUT THESE ON THE TABLE.

880
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:52,013
- JANICE IS AMAZING.

881
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:53,325
SHE ALWAYS HAS FOOD.
ALWAYS.

882
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:54,636
OH, LOOK WHO IT IS.

883
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:56,431
SLEEPING BEAUTY.
- HEY, ROG.

884
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:59,814
- YOU CAN SEE WHY NICOLE AND
JIONNI DON'’T WANNA GO ANYWHERE.

885
00:31:59,814 --> 00:32:01,816
- HE'’S HEAVY.
- HE'’S BULKING UP.

886
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:03,059
- YEAH, HE'’S BULKING UP.

887
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:05,406
ALL FIVE PERCENT OF HIM.
- [laughs]

888
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:08,374
- HE'’S AT FIVE PERCENTILE
IN HIS HEIGHT.

889
00:32:08,374 --> 00:32:09,375
- THAT GOOD?

890
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,894
OR THAT'’S THE BOTTOM?

891
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:11,930
- THE BOTTOM.
LIKE, HE'’S GONNA BE SMALL.

892
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,828
- CONSIDERING THAT GOES TO 100.

893
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:16,072
- IT'’S PRETTY LOW.
- OH, YEAH.

894
00:32:16,072 --> 00:32:19,109
- WELL, IT'’S FIVE--FIVE--FIVE
PERCENT MORE THAN I WAS.

895
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:20,628
- YEAH.
- YOU WERE ZERO?

896
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:21,594
- IF HE WAS BIG, I WOULD BE
GETTING A PATERNITY TEST.

897
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:22,802
- THAT'’S WHAT SHE SAID.

898
00:32:22,802 --> 00:32:23,769
I THINK SHE'’S LYING
JUST TO BE FUNNY.

899
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:25,322
MOM, I WASN'’T ZERO.

900
00:32:25,322 --> 00:32:26,358
THAT'’S IMPOSSIBLE.

901
00:32:26,358 --> 00:32:27,566
- ONE TIME
WE WENT TO THE DOCTOR

902
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:28,636
SO HE SAYS TO ME,

903
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:30,086
"YOU KNOW
JIONNI'’S REALLY SHORT."

904
00:32:30,086 --> 00:32:31,535
- PLEASE DON'’T TELL HIM THIS.

905
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:34,953
- "YOU KNOW, HE HAS FEATURES
OF A LITTLE PERSON."

906
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,955
- OH!
- OH!

907
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,818
- SO HE MAKES ME
TAKE HIM TO A DOCTOR.

908
00:32:38,818 --> 00:32:40,406
SO I TAKE HIM TO A DOCTOR.

909
00:32:40,406 --> 00:32:41,960
AND I WALK IN,
THE DOCTOR SAYS TO ME

910
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,860
HE HAS A BIGGER UPPER BODY
THAN HE HAS A LOWER BODY.

911
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,655
- HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT YOUR PEE-PEE.

912
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:49,243
- HE USED TO BE--
[laughs]

913
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:50,451
- OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

914
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:53,799
I LOVE JANICE SO MUCH.
PLEASE, PLEASE.

915
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:54,973
IT'’S LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING,
YOU KNOW?

916
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,491
ANY TIME I LEARN
INFORMATION LIKE THIS

917
00:32:56,491 --> 00:32:58,459
ABOUT JIONNI IS A GOOD DAY.
[all laugh]

918
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:00,633
- HE USED TO
BE REALLY TINY HERE

919
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:04,327
AND THEN UP HERE,
HE WAS, LIKE, HUGE.

920
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:05,742
- MA, PUT THE SANGRIA DOWN.

921
00:33:05,742 --> 00:33:07,813
- YOU GOOD FOR ABOUT A YEAR?
- YEAH.

922
00:33:07,813 --> 00:33:09,297
- STOP GIVING ROGER AMMUNITION.

923
00:33:09,297 --> 00:33:10,816
HE MAKES FUN OF ME ENOUGH.

924
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:11,851
ZIP IT.

925
00:33:11,851 --> 00:33:13,129
- BRACES?
- OH, YOUR BRACES.

926
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:15,614
HIS SHOES WERE SCREWED ON,
BUT THEY WENT THIS WAY.

927
00:33:15,614 --> 00:33:17,236
- A FEW YEARS, I'’LL BE GOOD.

928
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:18,617
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
MY FEET WERE THAT WAY?

929
00:33:18,617 --> 00:33:20,515
- EXPLAINS
YOUR DANCE MOVES AT LEAST.

930
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:22,345
- HEY.
[all laugh]

931
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:24,485
- THAT'’S SO MEAN.

932
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:26,211
- OH, CAN YOU DRINK?

933
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:27,557
WE BROUGHT A RED AND A WHITE.

934
00:33:27,557 --> 00:33:29,214
- YEAH, I'’M READY
TO DRINK TONIGHT.

935
00:33:29,214 --> 00:33:31,354
- SO WHAT ELSE, MAN?

936
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:34,012
HOW'’S THINGS SINCE LORENZO'’S
BEEN HOME AND STUFF?

937
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,255
- HE'’S THE FIRST THING
ON OUR MINDS NOW, YOU KNOW?

938
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:38,292
- DOES THAT TAKE AWAY
FROM TOGETHER TIME?

939
00:33:38,292 --> 00:33:39,810
- YEAH, IT DEFINITELY DOES.

940
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,605
NICOLE DOESN'’T LIKE IT, BUT...
- SHE DOESN'’T LIKE--

941
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:43,055
- SHE WANTS
TO CUDDLE AND KISS

942
00:33:43,055 --> 00:33:44,539
AND I'’M JUST, LIKE--
- NOT ABOUT IT?

943
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:45,885
- NO.
- REALLY?

944
00:33:45,885 --> 00:33:47,025
- NOT REALLY.

945
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,474
- SHE PROBABLY
WANTS TO MAKE SURE

946
00:33:48,474 --> 00:33:50,062
THAT YOU'’RE STILL LIKE--
- YEAH. NO, SHE DOES.

947
00:33:50,062 --> 00:33:51,270
- THAT'’S HOW WOMEN ARE,
YOU KNOW?

948
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,929
- DO I LOOK ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH, YOU LOOK GOOD.

949
00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:57,345
- YOU THINK
I'’LL COME BACK LIKE "HEY!"

950
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:58,691
- I HOPE SO.

951
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:00,452
- I'’M SO EXCITED TO JUST,
YOU KNOW,

952
00:34:00,452 --> 00:34:01,970
TRY AND GET THE ROMANCE BACK
WITH JIONNI

953
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,869
AND ALSO TO HAVE
A GLASS OF WINE.

954
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:04,973
- OR TWO.

955
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:06,320
- BECAUSE I HAVEN'’T HAD
A GL--YEAH.

956
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,425
BECAUSE I HAVEN'’T HAD
A GLASS OF WINE IN NINE MONTHS.

957
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:10,048
- LAST NIGHT I HAD TWO GLASSES
OF WINE AND I WAS...

958
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,291
- YOU'’RE A LIGHTWEIGHT.
- ALL OVER THE PLACE.

959
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:16,261
[Lorenzo cries]

960
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:23,095
- JUST FOR [bleep].

961
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:25,891
OH, MY GOD.

962
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:27,099
SORRY. SORRY.

963
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,997
- [grunts]

964
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:30,689
- THIS IS MY LIFE, ROG.

965
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:33,243
FEEDING BABIES,
CHANGING DIAPERS.

966
00:34:33,243 --> 00:34:34,589
- HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE HIM
TO DRINK THAT BOTTLE?

967
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:36,902
- UH, I DON'’T KNOW.

968
00:34:36,902 --> 00:34:38,317
BABIES HAVE THE NATURAL--

969
00:34:38,317 --> 00:34:39,801
IF YOU STICK SOMETHING
IN THEIR MOUTH,

970
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:41,182
THEY SUCK ON IT.

971
00:34:41,182 --> 00:34:43,702
IT'’S LIKE--IT'’S LIKE
THEY'’RE BORN WITH--

972
00:34:43,702 --> 00:34:46,084
- I DON'’T THINK JENNI
WAS BORN WITH THAT.

973
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,947
I HONESTLY THINK JENNI
MISSED A GENE THERE.

974
00:34:47,947 --> 00:34:51,813
[both laugh]

975
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:55,783
- OH, MY GOD.

976
00:35:07,795 --> 00:35:09,486
- I'’M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS, OKAY?

977
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,557
WHOA!

978
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:13,180
[bleep].
- WHAT?

979
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:16,424
- I HAVE TO GET USED
TO THESE HEELS.

980
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:19,186
- BEING THAT THERE ARE TENSIONS
BETWEEN ME AND NICOLE,

981
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:21,119
I THINK THIS DINNER'’S
GONNA BE HUGE.

982
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,637
IT'’S GONNA BE
REALLY ROMANTIC FOR US.

983
00:35:22,637 --> 00:35:23,638
AND I THINK WE NEED THIS.

984
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:25,053
- HEY, HANDSOME.

985
00:35:25,053 --> 00:35:26,400
- HI.

986
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,435
I GOTTA GET MONEY FIRST.

987
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:28,954
- LOOKING BACK FOUR YEARS AGO,

988
00:35:28,954 --> 00:35:32,233
I WOULDN'’T THINK I WOULD HAVE
JWOWW BABYSITTING MY BABY.

989
00:35:32,233 --> 00:35:35,754
- LET ALONE ME BABYSITTING
SNOOKI'’S BABY.

990
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:38,895
- EW!
- [laughs]

991
00:35:38,895 --> 00:35:40,690
- CAB'’S HERE.
- GOOD LUCK.

992
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,036
TAKE CARE OF OUR SON.

993
00:35:42,036 --> 00:35:43,589
HEY, I LOVE YOU.

994
00:35:43,589 --> 00:35:44,728
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK.

995
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,868
YOU CALL ME
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG.

996
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:48,422
- MOMMY LOVES YOU.
- DO NOT CALL US.

997
00:35:48,422 --> 00:35:50,044
- IS THIS FOR US?

998
00:35:50,044 --> 00:35:52,943
- YES, THAT'’S FOR THEM, RIGHT?
THAT WINE?

999
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,324
- [glugs]

1000
00:35:54,324 --> 00:35:56,119
- BYE.
- BYE, LORENZO.

1001
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,465
- ENJOY.
- I LOVE YOU.

1002
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:59,329
- BYE.
- BYE.

1003
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:03,368
- MAKE SURE YOU BURP HIM.

1004
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:07,958
MAKE SURE YOU CHECK
HIS DIAPER.

1005
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,512
MAKE SURE YOU--
- JIONNI!

1006
00:36:09,512 --> 00:36:10,616
- GOOD BYE.

1007
00:36:10,616 --> 00:36:12,963
- GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

1008
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,689
- TIME FOR YOUR FEEDING.

1009
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:17,313
I FEEL LIKE I'’M VERY NATURAL
WITH LORENZO.

1010
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:19,177
I DON'’T KNOW
IF IT'’S MOTHERLY INSTINCTS.

1011
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,592
I DON'’T KNOW IF IT'’S JUST
BECAUSE, LIKE--

1012
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:23,629
- THERE'’S NOTHING NATURAL ABOUT
YOUR "MOTHERLY INSTINCTS."

1013
00:36:23,629 --> 00:36:25,942
- I HAVEN'’T BEEN OUT
THIS LATE IN YEARS.

1014
00:36:25,942 --> 00:36:29,256
I FEEL YOUNG AGAIN.

1015
00:36:29,256 --> 00:36:31,603
- THIS AUTOMATIC?

1016
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:32,604
- [laughs]

1017
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:34,744
- IS THIS A JOKE?

1018
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:35,952
- WE'’RE PARENTS.

1019
00:36:35,952 --> 00:36:39,335
WE DON'’T KNOW.

1020
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:41,199
- YOU COULD FIT HIM
IN THAT SHOE.

1021
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,200
DEFINITELY.

1022
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,649
- JANICE.
