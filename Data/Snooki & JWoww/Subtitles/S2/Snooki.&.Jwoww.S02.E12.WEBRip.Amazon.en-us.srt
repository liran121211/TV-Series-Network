[giggles]

507
00:19:37,106 --> 00:19:39,592
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

508
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:42,181
I'’VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE SAY HI
AND START GIGGLING

509
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,044
LIKE YOU'’RE EIGHT.

00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:45,667

511
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:46,668
PLEASE, I'’M NOT KIDDING.

512
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:47,807
I'’M VERY NERVOUS.

513
00:19:47,807 --> 00:19:49,015

514
00:19:49,015 --> 00:19:50,327

515
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:52,191
YOU CAN'’T DO ANY WORSE

00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,193

520
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:00,923
HOLD ON,
JIONNI HAS A QUESTION.

521
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:02,580

[laughs]

525
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:11,140
DO YOU GUYS THROW PARTIES?

526
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,384
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.
THAT'’S WHAT WE DO THERE.

527
00:20:13,384 --> 00:20:15,455

UM, WELL...

528
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:18,044
I WANT TO THROW A SURPRISE PARTY
FOR MY BEST FRIEND.

529
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:21,116
THANK GOD WE FINALLY FIND
A PLACE,

530
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:24,015
AND HOPEFULLY JENNI AND ROGER
WILL SHOW UP.

531
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,121
- SO WHO DO WE INVITE?

532
00:20:26,121 --> 00:20:28,054
- I THINK IT'’S JUST GONNA BE
THE ROOMIES.

533
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:31,160
- I REALLY DON'’T KNOW WHETHER
IT'’S A "MEET LORENZO" PARTY

534
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,955
OR, YOU KNOW,
A SURPRISE ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

535
00:20:32,955 --> 00:20:34,647
SO I'’M JUST GONNA KEEP IT
SIMPLE,

536
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:36,476
AND I'’M GONNA INVITE
THE SHORE ROOMIES.

537
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:37,926
- WHAT'’S UP?

538
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:40,584
- I CALLED

539

TO JENNI'’S SURPRISE
ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

540
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:44,864
SHE JUST GOT ENGAGED.
- OH, COOL.

541
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:47,349
- BUT IT'’S A SURPRISE,
SO YOU CAN'’T TELL HER.

542
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:48,695
AND I INVITED
ALL THE SHORE ROOMIES.

543
00:20:48,695 --> 00:20:50,249
SO EVERYONE IS COMING,
I FEEL.

544
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,974
- COOL. IS LORENZO GOING
TO BE THERE?

545
00:20:51,974 --> 00:20:53,804
- YEAH.
- YEAH, I CAN COME.

546
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:55,357
- COOL.

547
00:20:55,357 --> 00:20:57,463
I'’LL TEXT YOU THE ADDRESS.

548
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:58,602
- ALL RIGHT,
THANKS FOR THE INVITE.

549
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:01,190
- OKAY, BYE.
- ALL RIGHT, BYE.

550
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:04,746

I KNOW YOU HAVEN'’T TORMENTED
YOUR SISTER IN A WHILE.

556
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:23,178
- OH.

557
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:24,179

ARE YOU STILL ANGRY?

00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:37,882

564
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:39,815
LET'’S GO IN HERE.
I CAN'’T EVEN HEAR YOU.

565
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:42,439
- THE FACT THAT ROGER HAS DIESEL
WITH HIM RIGHT NOW MEANS

566
00:21:42,439 --> 00:21:44,475
THAT HE IS OBVIOUSLY WILLING
TO COME HOME.

567
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:45,994
HE'’S JUST WILLING TO STAY HERE.

568
00:21:45,994 --> 00:21:48,859
I KNOW YOU LIKE YOUR ROLLS
AND I LIKE MY--

569
00:21:48,859 --> 00:21:49,929
- YEAH, YEAH.
NO, THIS IS AWESOME.

570
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:51,379
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WANT TO SIT NOW?

571
00:21:51,379 --> 00:21:52,828
- YEAH.
- YEAH. OKAY.

572
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:53,933
ALL RIGHT.

573
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:54,899
YOU KNOW,
IT'’S BEEN A COUPLE DAYS.

574
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,004
I'’VE DEFINITELY COOLED OFF.

575
00:21:56,004 --> 00:21:58,455
AND, YOU KNOW,
I'’M BACK HERE TODAY

576
00:21:58,455 --> 00:22:00,733
TO SEE IF WE CAN GET
EVERYTHING STRAIGHT.

577
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,287
- I JUST WANT TO SAY SORRY
FOR TAKING IT TOO FAR

578
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:04,702
LIKE I HAVE A HABIT OF DOING.

579
00:22:04,702 --> 00:22:05,841
- [clears throat]

580
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:07,878
WELL, I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE
THAT.

581
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:09,189
I THINK IT'’S IMPORTANT, THOUGH,

582
00:22:09,189 --> 00:22:10,467
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND
WHY IT MADE ME MAD.

583
00:22:10,467 --> 00:22:12,331
DO YOU UNDER--
DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT?

584
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,679
- MY ATTITUDE?
- IT WAS JUST THAT--

585
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,509
I DON'’T GET A LOT OF TIME
TO HANG OUT WITH YOU.

586
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:21,443
YOU KNOW, I WORK A LOT,
SO I DON'’T GET MUCH TIME.

587
00:22:21,443 --> 00:22:23,134
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE HUNG OVER.
I GET THAT.

588
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,791
BUT WE HAD--WE HAD PLANS.

589
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:26,621
IT WASN'’T LIKE
WE DIDN'’T HAVE PLANS.

590
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:28,795
YOU ACTUALLY MADE THOSE PLANS,
AND THEY WERE,

591
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:32,178
YOU KNOW, WELL IN ADVANCE
OF YOU GOING OUT SATURDAY NIGHT.

592
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:34,905
- I DO FEEL BAD FOR THAT.

593
00:22:34,905 --> 00:22:37,425
- BUT WE SHOULD NOT BE
AT THIS STAGE

594
00:22:37,425 --> 00:22:40,082
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

595
00:22:40,082 --> 00:22:42,361
I FELT LIKE WE CAME
THROUGH THE WORST OF THIS.

596
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,673
WE USED TO DO THIS A LOT.

597
00:22:44,673 --> 00:22:46,848
AND I REALLY THOUGHT WE WERE
ON PRETTY STABLE GROUND.

598
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:48,746
I ALWAYS KNOW THAT WE'’RE GONNA
BUTT HEADS HERE AND HERE.

599
00:22:48,746 --> 00:22:51,059
BUT I DIDN'’T THINK
A WEEK AFTER WE WERE,

600
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:53,751
YOU KNOW, ENGAGED,
I'’M GOING TO BE LEAVING

601
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:55,477
THE HOUSE
BECAUSE WE'’RE BICKERING SO BAD.

602
00:22:55,477 --> 00:22:57,824
BUT IT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT,
YOU KNOW,

603
00:22:57,824 --> 00:22:59,274
MAYBE I JUMPED THE GUN
A LITTLE EARLY.

604
00:22:59,274 --> 00:23:02,829
MAYBE, YOU KNOW, LIKE--
- WELL, THAT'’S NICE.

605
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:04,313
- DO YOU THINK
THAT'’S NORMAL BEHAVIOR

606
00:23:04,313 --> 00:23:07,938
TO ACT LIKE THIS A WEEK
AFTER WE'’RE ENGAGED?

607
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:09,042
- NO.
- I DON'’T THINK

608
00:23:09,042 --> 00:23:10,389
THAT'’S NORMAL BEHAVIOR.

609
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,321
- NORMAL BEHAVIOR IS APOLOGIZING
AND MOVING ON.

610
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:14,151
- I AGREE,
AND THAT'’S WHY WE'’RE HERE.

611
00:23:14,151 --> 00:23:15,773
AND WE'’RE STILL ENGAGED,
AND WE STILL LOVE EACH OTHER,

612
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:17,396
AND, YOU KNOW, ALL IS WELL.

613
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,432
BUT I'’M JUST EXPLAINING
MY FEELINGS, YOU KNOW.

614
00:23:19,432 --> 00:23:21,814
- WILL YOU READ YOUR FORTUNE?
I LOST A FORTUNE.

615
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:24,299
- YES, WILL YOU--
MINE SAYS,

616
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:27,095
"WHY THE [bleep] DOES JENNI KEEP
DEFLECTING SO MUCH?"

617
00:23:27,095 --> 00:23:28,303
THAT'’S WHAT IT SAYS.

618
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:29,753
I CAN READ IT.
- [laughs]

619
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:32,859
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
YEAH, LET'’S MOVE PAST IT.

620
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,620
YOU KNOW, NO SENSE
IN BEATING IT ANYMORE.

621
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,828
I'’M GLAD I'’M HERE.
I LOVE YOU.

622
00:23:35,828 --> 00:23:37,036
THANK YOU FOR THIS.

623
00:23:37,036 --> 00:23:38,347
- THERE'’S A WEIGHT
LIFTED OFF MY SHOULDERS

624
00:23:38,347 --> 00:23:40,108
BY ROGER ACCEPTING MY APOLOGY.

625
00:23:40,108 --> 00:23:42,938
AND I'’M GLAD '’CAUSE SOMETIMES
YOU NEED TO FIGHT

626
00:23:42,938 --> 00:23:44,215
TO GET BACK TO THE BASICS,

627
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,734
GET BACK
TO WHY WE LOVE EACH OTHER,

628
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:47,874
WHY WE'’RE TOGETHER,
AND WHY WE WORK THROUGH THINGS.

WELL, IT JUST DID
IN THE LAST TWO DAYS.

THAT'’LL BREAK--

THE ONLY THING
THAT WILL BREAK A DIAMOND

635
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:02,095
IS JUST RAW, COLD STEEL.

636
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:03,856

00:31:12,387 --> 00:31:14,596
I'’M VERY PROUD OF BOTH
OF YOU.

844
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:16,944
THIS GUY--YOU GUYS READY
FOR A BABY.

845
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:18,738
[laughter]

846
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:21,431
- YOU'’RE READY FOR A BABY NEXT.
- ROOKIE.

847
00:31:24,952 --> 00:31:26,229
- BABY SHOWER?

848
00:31:26,229 --> 00:31:27,782
WE'’RE NOT GOING
TO A BABY SHOWER, ARE WE?

849
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:30,233
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
A "MEET LORENZO" PARTY.

850
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:31,268
- READY, GUYS?

851
00:31:31,268 --> 00:31:32,649
- READY?

852
00:31:32,649 --> 00:31:36,549
all: SURPRISE!

853
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:37,688
[all shouting]

854
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:39,898
- DON'’T DO IT!
DON'’T DO IT!

855
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,177
DON'’T DO IT!
DON'’T DO IT!

856
00:31:43,177 --> 00:31:45,041
- IS THIS FOR US?

857
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:47,077
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- EVERYBODY'’S HERE.

858
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:49,114
- HOLY [bleep].
IT'’S A PARTY FOR ME.

859
00:31:49,114 --> 00:31:51,564
AND I'’M SPEECHLESS.
- SURPRISE, BITCH.

860
00:31:51,564 --> 00:31:53,601
- THANK YOU.
- I PULLED IT OFF.

861
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:55,051
- HEY, GUYS.
- AW, THANK YOU.

862
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:56,121
- WHOO-HOO!

863
00:31:56,121 --> 00:31:57,846
- SEXY DRESS.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

864
00:31:57,846 --> 00:31:58,847
- THANK YOU.
- CONGRATS, BRO.

865
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:00,677
- CONGRATS, AGAIN.
- AW, THANK YOU.

866
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:02,817
- CONGRATS.
- WERE YOU SURPRISED?

867
00:32:02,817 --> 00:32:04,094
- YEAH, I WAS.
- CONGRATS, JENNI.

868
00:32:04,094 --> 00:32:05,854
- I CAN'’T BELIEVE
ALL YOU GUYS ARE HERE, MAN.

869
00:32:05,854 --> 00:32:09,134
I WAS MOST IMPRESSED
THAT ALL JENNI'’S, YOU KNOW,

870
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:11,722
SHORE MATES COULD BE THERE.

871
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,242
- LET'’S POP SOME CHAMPAGNE,
YEAH.

872
00:32:14,242 --> 00:32:15,485
- I NEVER EXPECTED IT,

873
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:17,452
AND I WAS KIND OF
REALLY TOUCHED BY THAT.

874
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:18,488
AND IT WAS REALLY AWESOME

875
00:32:18,488 --> 00:32:19,661
THAT THEY COULD DO THAT
FOR US.

876
00:32:19,661 --> 00:32:22,906
- SO HOW WAS SKYDIVING?
- HOW DID YOU ASK HER?

877
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:24,149
- I WENT DOWN THERE,
I MET WITH THE PEOPLE,

878
00:32:24,149 --> 00:32:26,254
I SET IT ALL UP,
HAD THE SIGN MADE, YOU KNOW...

879
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:27,566
- YEAH.
- THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

880
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:29,533
AND I'’M LIKE, "LISTEN."
- WHAT WAS THE SIGN?

881
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:31,328
- IT JUST SAID,
"WILL YOU MARRY ME, JENNI?"

882
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:32,709
BUT IT WAS SPREAD OUT
WHERE WE LANDED.

883
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,228
- OH, AND SHE COULD SEE IT
FROM THE SKY.

884
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:36,782
- YEAH, YEAH.
- THAT'’S GANGSTER.

885
00:32:36,782 --> 00:32:39,198
SO GET IT STRAIGHT.
NICOLE'’S A MOM.

886
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:40,820
JENNI AND ROGER ARE ENGAGED.

887
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,962
ALL I KNOW IS, HOW THE HELL
ARE YOU GONNA TOP THAT, RONNIE?

888
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,964
[laughter]

889
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,724
- SUCH A [bleep].

890
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:50,623
I MIGHT AS WELL DO IT NOW,
RIGHT?

891
00:32:50,623 --> 00:32:51,797
YEAH, RIGHT!

892
00:32:51,797 --> 00:32:53,557
- OH, MY GOD!

893
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,283
[all laughing]
- HE PLANNED THAT.

894
00:32:55,283 --> 00:32:56,388
- HE DOES IT EVERY PARTY.

895
00:32:56,388 --> 00:32:58,735
- I KNOW.
HE DOES THAT ALL THE TIME.

896
00:32:58,735 --> 00:33:01,910
- WE GOT TO DO A TOAST.
- YEAH.

897
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,291
WE'’RE GONNA GO AROUND,
AND I'’M GONNA START.

898
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:04,396
- OKAY.

899
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:05,949
- JENNI, YOU'’RE MY BEST FRIEND.

900
00:33:05,949 --> 00:33:08,814
AND I HOPE I SURPRISED YOU,
AND I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

901
00:33:08,814 --> 00:33:12,059
AND THANK YOU, ROGER,
FOR FINALLY PROPOSING

902
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,508
'’CAUSE I WAS GETTING PISSED.
- THANKS, BOO.

903
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:14,475
- THANK YOU.
- LOVE YOU.

904
00:33:14,475 --> 00:33:15,821
- YAY.

905
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:17,685
YOU GUYS JUST FIT
SO PERFECTLY TOGETHER,

906
00:33:17,685 --> 00:33:19,721
AND I'’VE NEVER SEEN
JENNI HAPPIER.

907
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:22,586
CONGRATS AND, YOU KNOW,
WE LOVE YOU.

908
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:25,313
- THANK YOU.

909
00:33:25,313 --> 00:33:26,763
- I'’M HAPPY
FOR THE BOTH OF YOU.

910
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:28,558
EVER SINCE YOU CAME
INTO JENNI'’S LIFE,

911
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:29,559
SHE'’S BEEN A GREAT PERSON,

912
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:30,594
A GREAT FRIEND TO BE AROUND.

913
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:32,251
BEFORE THAT--
- I WAS A [bleep].

914
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:33,356
YOU CAN ADMIT IT.

915
00:33:33,356 --> 00:33:36,324
- SHE SAID IT.

916
00:33:36,324 --> 00:33:38,154
- JENNI, I'’M VERY HAPPY
FOR YOU GUYS.

917
00:33:38,154 --> 00:33:40,018
I LOVE YOU TWO AS A COUPLE,
AND I WISH YOU THE BEST.

918
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,295
- THANK YOU.

919
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:44,332
- LET ME PUT ON MY GLASSES.
HOLD ON.

920
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:45,575
[clears throat]

921
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:48,854
"ROGER, YOU ARE THE BEST MAN

922
00:33:48,854 --> 00:33:50,752
FOR MY SISTER, JENNI."

923
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:52,547
- YOU SPELLED "ROGER" WRONG.
- OH. SORRY.

924
00:33:52,547 --> 00:33:54,204
- THERE'’S NO "D" IN IT.

925
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:55,861
[laughter]

926
00:33:55,861 --> 00:33:58,070
"CONGRATULATIONS,
AND I WISH YOU GUYS THE BEST."

927
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:01,073
- YAY!
- AW, CUTE.

928
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:03,834
- WE ALWAYS KID AROUND
ABOUT HOW WE'’RE LIKE

929
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,699
THIS BIG FAMILY AND WE'’VE
BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH TOGETHER.

930
00:34:06,699 --> 00:34:08,839
AND TO SEE YOU GUYS,
YOU COME INTO HER LIFE,

931
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,013

933
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,637
- THANK YOU.

934
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:14,845
SHE'’S A SISTER,
AND NOW YOU'’RE A BROTHER.

935
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,054

937
00:34:18,297 --> 00:34:20,679
IT'’S SO COOL THAT EVERYBODY

938
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,301
ABOUT JENNI'’S
AND MY ENGAGEMENT.

939
00:34:22,301 --> 00:34:23,751
I MEAN, THAT MEANS A LOT,
YOU KNOW.

940
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:25,891
DEFINITELY A HEARTFELT MOMENT
FOR SURE.

941
00:34:25,891 --> 00:34:27,134
- YAY.

942
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:28,652
- THANK YOU, GUYS.

943
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:29,619
- I GO?

944
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:31,172
- YEAH.

945
00:34:31,172 --> 00:34:32,173
- CONGRATULATIONS.

946
00:34:32,173 --> 00:34:33,968
I'’M VERY PROUD OF BOTH OF YOU.

947
00:34:33,968 --> 00:34:36,867
THIS GUY--YOU GUYS
READY FOR A BABY.

948
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,248
[laughter]

949
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:40,078
YOU'’RE READY FOR A BABY NEXT.

950
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,493
- ROOKIE.

951
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:44,530
[laughter]

952
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,567
- [clears throat]

953
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:49,949
- "ROGER, JENNI, THIS GUY--"
- [laughs]

954
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:51,744
- [clears throat]

955
00:34:51,744 --> 00:34:53,815
THIS GROUP IS LIKE A BUNCH
OF HYENAS, SOME SAVAGES.

956
00:34:53,815 --> 00:34:55,645
YOU CAN'’T PAUSE
FOR ONE SECOND.

957
00:34:55,645 --> 00:34:56,611
I WAS BUILDING UP,
YOU KNOW.

958
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,337
IT WAS ALONG THE LINES OF,

959
00:34:58,337 --> 00:35:00,615
"LOOK AT THIS GUY,
LOOK AT HIM,

960
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,721
LOOK AT YOU.
THE BABY'’S COMING NEXT."

961
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:04,585
MY SPEECH SUCKED.

962
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:07,035
- JUST EXPECT IT SOON.
THAT'’S IT.

963
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:08,520
- CONGRATULATIONS.

964
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,902
[laughter]

965
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,835
IT'’S THE LAST TIME I MAKE
A SPEECH WITH THESE GUYS.

966
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:16,044
IF THERE'’S A SPEECH
AT JENNI AND ROGER'’S WEDDING,

967
00:35:16,044 --> 00:35:17,080
MY ASS IS GONNA BE
IN THE BATHROOM.

968
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,254
I AIN'’T SAYING [bleep].

969
00:35:18,254 --> 00:35:20,118
- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY
TO EVERYBODY,

970
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,292
YOU KNOW, I WAS
KIND OF THE OUTSIDER

971
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:24,743
NOT THAT LONG AGO.

972
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:26,262
AND, YOU KNOW,
EVERYBODY'’S ALWAYS BEEN

973
00:35:26,262 --> 00:35:27,849
EXTREMELY RESPECTFUL TO ME

974
00:35:27,849 --> 00:35:30,197
AND ALWAYS HAD OUR BACK,
AND THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

975
00:35:30,197 --> 00:35:32,268
AND I JUST WANT TO THANK
EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE TODAY.

976
00:35:32,268 --> 00:35:34,339
I KNOW EVERYBODY'’S
EXTREMELY BUSY.

977
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:36,099
AND IT MEANS A LOT,
SO THANK YOU.

978
00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:40,207
- YEAH. THANK YOU, GUYS.
[all cheering]

979
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:42,899
- LET'’S DO A CHEERS
TO JENNI AND ROGER.

980
00:35:42,899 --> 00:35:44,452
- SALUTE.
- THANK YOU, GUYS.

981
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:46,144
- JENNI AND ROGER!
- CONGRATULATIONS.

982
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,800
- I LOVE ENGAGEMENTS
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

983
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,940
- THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
- CHEERS.

984
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,080
- I'’M SO USED TO HANGING OUT
WITH YOU GUYS IN SEASIDE,

985
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,220
I JUST LITERALLY CHUGGED THAT

986
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,393
LIKE IT WAS A SHOT
LITERALLY.

987
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:56,257
AND THEN I REALIZED,
THAT'’S CHAMPAGNE.

988
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:59,295
- IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME
THAT MY ROOMMATES LOVE ROGER

989
00:35:59,295 --> 00:36:02,919
AS, YOU KNOW, ANOTHER ROOMMATE,
LIKE, OUR NINTH ROOMMATE.

990
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:04,990
- I FEEL LIKE,
IF I'’M THE NINTH ROOMMATE,

991
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:09,995
THEN IT'’S ONLY FAIR THAT JIONNI
WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, 9 1/2.

992
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:12,100
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
I'’M GONNA GET OUT OF HERE.

993
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,033
- I GOTTA GET GOING MYSELF.

994
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:16,001
- BYE.
- MWAH.

995
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:17,727
- BYE, UNCLE PAULY.

996
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:19,901
I AM VERY PROUD
THAT I PULLED THIS OFF.

997
00:36:19,901 --> 00:36:21,627
I MEAN, BEING SO STRESSED
AND OVERWHELMED

998
00:36:21,627 --> 00:36:22,904
AND EVERYTHING THAT'’S GOING ON,

999
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:25,148
THE FACT THAT I GOT
TO SURPRISE MY BEST FRIEND,

1000
00:36:25,148 --> 00:36:26,529
I FEEL GOOD.

1001
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:29,187
- READY, BABE?
- LET'’S GO.

1002
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:32,190
I THINK WE DID GOOD.
- I THINK WE DID GREAT.

1003
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,881
- WHOO!

1004
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,645
- THERE'’S MORE
SNOOKI &amp; JWOWWON THE WAY.

1005
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:42,027
- AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

1006
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:45,203
- ♪ WE'’RE GONNA RUN AWAY ♪

1007
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,827
♪ TAKE THE LONG WAY ♪

1008
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:50,415
- OH, MY GOD,
I'’M GONNA POOP MY PANTS.
