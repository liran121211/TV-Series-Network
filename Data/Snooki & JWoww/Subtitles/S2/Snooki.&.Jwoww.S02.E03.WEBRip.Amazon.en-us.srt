00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,167
I'M GONNA DELIVER
A 10-POUND KID.

- [laughing]
OH, MY GOD.

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,867
- IS IT WEIRD IF I TRY ON
WEDDING DRESSES FOR FUN?

8
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:15,067
- KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

9
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:16,733

FOR RINGS?

10
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,767

- IT'S A DIFFERENT--
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

- IF I HAD TO GUESS...
- YEAH, RIGHT.

14
00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:25,433

FOR A ONE-KARAT STONE.

15
00:00:25,533 --> 00:00:26,500
- YEAH.

00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,100
- WHERE WERE YOU JUST NOW?

42
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,233
- UPSTAIRS.

I JUST DON'T FEEL GOOD.
[crying]

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,533

45
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:25,633
AND I NEVER SEE HER EMOTIONS
REALLY TAKE OVER LIKE THIS.

AS A FIANCE,
AS THE FATHER, IT JUST--

I WISH I COULD, YOU KNOW,
TAKE THE PAIN AWAY.

THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
- WE'RE HAVING A KID TOGETHER.

85

IT'S JUST A COUPLE
OF FRIENDS OVER.

IT'S VERY WEIRD TO SEE MY DAD
IN THE HOT TUB RIGHT NOW.

00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,433
I DEFINITELY WANT JIONNI

353
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,833
TO GO THROUGH THE DRY RUN

354
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:40,400
JUST BECAUSE
HE'S THE ONE DRIVING.

355
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,567
HE NEEDS TO BE
IN CONTROL

356
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:42,567
WHILE I'M THE ONE,
YOU KNOW,

357
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:43,600
THAT'S FREAKING OUT.

358
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,000
I'M GONNA FINISH
GETTING READY,

359
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
BUT I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
WHEN I'M TESTING YOU.

360
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,100
- OKAY.

361
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,967
- DO SOMETHING.

362
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,900
MOP THE FLOOR OR SOMETHING.

363
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,033
I KIND OF WANT
TO CATCH HIM OFF GUARD

364
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:55,667
BECAUSE, LIKE, WE DON'T KNOW
WHEN IT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

365
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:57,400
SO I KIND OF WANT IT
TO BE LIKE,

366
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
YOU KNOW, IT'S REAL,

367
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,400
AND HE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON,

368
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,733
AND THEN IT JUST HAPPENS.

369
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,600
OH, [bleep],
MY WATER JUST BROKE!

370
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,600
[laughing]
OH, MY GOD.

371
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,800
JIONNI, I'M KIDDING.

372
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,200
- [laughs]
YOU HANDLED THAT VERY WELL.

373
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,100
- I KICKED YOU IN THE HEAD?
- YEAH.

374
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,633
DO YOU HAVE TO SHOWER?

375
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:21,833
- NO.
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?

376
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:23,200
- I WANT TO FREAK JIONNI OUT

377
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,567
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
ON THIS DRY RUN...

378
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,067
[screaming]

379
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:28,300
- SHH!

380
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
- JUST BECAUSE I KNOW
I'M GONNA BE

381
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,233
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON
WHEN MY WATER DOES BREAK.

382
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,633
IT HURTS!

383
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:34,767
- [bleep].

384
00:11:34,867 --> 00:11:36,767
- PUTTING MY TIMER ON.

385
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,100
GO!

386
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,133
SERIOUSLY, OKAY? DO IT.
BABY'S GONNA POP OUT.

387
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:42,133
OKAY, WE'RE LOSING
PRECIOUS MOMENTS RIGHT NOW.

388
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,933
IF THERE'S TRAFFIC
LIKE THIS,

389
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,667
I'M GONNA SHOOT EVERYONE
IN THE FACE.

390
00:11:45,767 --> 00:11:47,100
- I'M CALLING JENNI.

391
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,067
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.
[honks horn]

392
00:11:49,133 --> 00:11:51,200
[both laughing]

393
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,767
- [kissing]
GOOD NIGHT.

394
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:56,633
- GOOD NIGHT, BOOGER.

395
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,133
I TRIED IT.
IT'S BROKEN.

396
00:11:58,233 --> 00:11:59,200
- OH.

397
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,067
[line ringing]

398
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:03,300
- JENNI, HELP ME NOW!

399
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,500
[laughter]

400
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,133
- WHAT? ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

401
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,567
- NICOLE'S WATER JUST BROKE.
WHAT DO WE DO?

402
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:09,767
- HE'S [bleep] WITH YOU.
HE'S LYING.

403
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,900
- OW!
- HE'S LYING.

404
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,267
- ARE YOU LYING TO ME?

405
00:12:13,367 --> 00:12:14,833
- ROGER, JENNI, TELL ME,
WHAT DO I DO?

406
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,300
- OW!
- [laughing]

407
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,767
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT DO YOU DO?

408
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,833
YOU'RE THE MAN
THAT GOT HER PREGNATED.

409
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:21,900
- I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

410
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:23,433
[both laughing]

411
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:27,333
- YOU'RE THE WORST [bleep] LIARS
KNOWN TO HUMAN MANKIND.

412
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:28,567
- BYE-BYE.

413
00:12:28,667 --> 00:12:29,767
- BYE. SEE YOU LATER.
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

414
00:12:29,867 --> 00:12:31,167
- IF JENNI, ON THE REAL DAY,

415
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,167
ANSWERS THE WAY SHE DID
JUST NOW,

416
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:35,067
I'M GONNA PUNCH HER
IN THE FACE.

417
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,100
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE HOSPITAL
IS, OR ARE YOU JUST DRIVING?

418
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,633
I DON'T SEE ANY SIGN
FOR A HOSPITAL.

419
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:41,067
- [gasps shakily]
- WHAT?

420
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:43,667
- WAS I SUPPOSED TO TURN?
- OH, [bleep].

421
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:47,733
- I'M LOST ON A DRY RUN
TO A PLACE FOUR MILES AWAY.

422
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,400
WHO GETS LOST TO A PLACE
YOU'VE BEEN TO 500 TIMES?

423
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,067
- WE'RE ON JFK PARKWAY.

424
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,600
- [gasps]
NO, WE'RE NOT.

425
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,067
- YEAH, WE ARE.
THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, JIONNI.

426
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,233
[coughs]
I JUST PEED MY PANTS.

427
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,767
- FOR REAL?

428
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:01,867
- YEAH.
- THAT'S YOUR WATER RIGHT THERE.

429
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:03,200
- [coughing and laughing]
I JUST PEED.

430
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,500
- ARE YOU SURE?
- I SWEAR.

431
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,733
- CHECK IT, CHECK IT.
- NO, IT'S PEE.

432
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:06,800
- BABE--
- I KNOW IT IS.

433
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,900
- BABE, BABE--

434
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:09,133
- IT'S PEE!

435
00:13:09,233 --> 00:13:10,867
I ENDED UP TINKLING MYSELF.

436
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,100
- EW!

437
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,233
- BUT IT'S NORMAL,

438
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,067
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
PREGNANT.

439
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:17,867
- WHAT IF I FAINT LIKE THAT
WHEN YOU TELL ME?

440
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:20,133
- YOU CAN'T.
I'LL BE LOST WITHOUT YOU.

441
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:24,400
- YOU WERE LOST WITH ME.

442
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,600
- STUPID.

443
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,067
CAN YOU STILL
WHEELCHAIR ME OUT?

444
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,500
- OF COURSE I WILL.

445
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,067
- GOING INTO THE DRY RUN,
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST GONNA BE

446
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,400
A WASTE OF TIME,
LIKE WHATEVER.

447
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,700
BUT ACTUALLY, DOING IT,
WE LEARNED A LOT.

448
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,100
- THERE'S A LOT
TO LEARN, BABY.

449
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,133
- AND WE JUST NEED TO BE
MORE, LIKE, FOCUSED.

450
00:13:42,533 --> 00:13:44,500
- TOOK US SEVEN MINUTES
TO GET HOME.

451
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,667
HOW LONG DID IT TAKE US
TO GET THERE?

452
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:49,467
- 25 MINUTES AND 8 SECONDS.

453
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:52,333
SO WE DEFINITELY [bleep] UP
WITH GETTING THERE,

454
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,967
BUT COMING BACK, NOW WE KNOW
THAT IT'S NOT THAT FAR,

455
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,367
AND WE SHOULD GET THERE
IN TIME WHERE, YOU KNOW,

456
00:13:57,467 --> 00:13:58,533
NOTHING WILL GO WRONG.

457
00:13:58,633 --> 00:13:59,867
IF WE DO IT RIGHT.

458
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:02,100
- WHY IS OUR FRONT DOOR OPEN?

459
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,933
- JIONNI, YOU LEFT
THE DOOR OPEN.

460
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:07,700
- WHAT?
- ASS[bleep].

461
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,200
[breathing rhythmically]

462
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,500
- EW.

463
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,933
- LAMAZE BREATHING
IS JUST SO STUPID.

464
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:15,767
IT'S LIKE...
[inhales, exhales]

465
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:17,500
LIKE, WHO BREATHES LIKE THAT?

466
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,300
I CAN'T BREATHE.

467
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,233
- JUST PICTURE THE BELLY
NOT THERE.

468
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,300
- I KNOW.
- OH, YOU LOOK SO CUTE.

469
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,267
- I DON'T KNOW HOW
IT WORKS.

470
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:25,333
LIKE, WHEN YOU HAVE A BABY,

471
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:26,933
DOES IT GO DOWN AGAIN?

472
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,233
- I LOVE IT.
THAT'S GOTTA BE IT.

473
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,800
- WHAT IF I HAVE HIM
AND I STILL LOOK LIKE THIS?

474
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,433
- YOU'RE NOT.
- I'LL BE SO PISSED.

475
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,367
- HI.

476
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:42,400
- I WANT BREAKFAST.

477
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,467
- BREAKFAST. HERE.

478
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,500
- OH, MY GOD,
MY STOMACH HURTS SO BAD.

479
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,467
[huffing and puffing]

480
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,700
- SHOULD I CALL BELLINI
NOW TOO?

481
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,233
- IF YOU WANT.

482
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,767
- RIGHT NOW, OUR NURSERY
IS JUST AN EMPTY ROOM.

483
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:56,300
NEED TO START, YOU KNOW,
GETTING THIS NURSERY READY.

484
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,733
NICOLE COULD GO ANY TIME NOW.

485
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,333
[line ringing]

486
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,467
- BELLINI. MAY I HELP YOU?

487
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,733
- HI, IS DANIELLE IN?

488
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,867
- UH, DANIELLE.
THERE'S NO DANIELLE HERE.

489
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:07,067
- OH, MY GOD,
IT'S NOT HER NAME.

490
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,267
- UH, MICHELLE?

491
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,133
- NO.

492
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:13,367
- IS THIS BELLINI?
- YES, IT IS.

493
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,400
- HI, THIS IS JIONNI LAVALLE.
UM--

494
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,733
- WE ORDERED FURNITURE.

495
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,067
- I WAS JUST, UH, CONFIRMING,
YOU KNOW,

496
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,567
UH, THE PROGRESS
ON OUR FURNITURE.

497
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:24,067
UM, YOU KNOW,
LIKE A ROUGH ESTIMATE

498
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,500
OF WHEN IT WOULD BE DELIVERED.

499
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,967
- UM, THAT SHOULD BE...

500
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:31,967
APPROXIMATELY THURSDAY,
THE 30th.

501
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,100
- SOUNDS GOOD.
AND, UM--

502
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,067
- THAT'S LIKE
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW.

503
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,633
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THESE PEOPLE
ARE DOING RIGHT NOW.

504
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:38,900
LIKE, ARE THEY MAKING IT
FROM SCRATCH?

505
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:41,567
JUST BECAUSE WE LEGIT ORDERED
THIS FURNITURE

506
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:42,800
LIKE A YEAR AGO,

507
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,633
AND IT'S TAKING FOREVER
TO GET HERE.

508
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:47,233
- YOU HAVE THE CRIB...

509
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,633
THE MATTRESS...

510
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,167
THE 58-INCH DRESSER...

511
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:55,067
THE SLIDE TOP,
AND THE ARMOIRE.

512
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,300
SO IT'S ONE...

513
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,833
- WHAT THE [bleep]'S
AN ARMOIRE?

514
00:15:58,933 --> 00:16:00,467
- TWO...

515
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:02,333
- "ARM-WAR"?
- "ARE-MORE".

516
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:04,467
- I DON'T KNOW.
- I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.

517
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:07,167
- AS LONG AS IT'S COMING,
IT'S WHATEVER.

518
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,967
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

519
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:12,367
- HAVE A GREAT DAY.
- YOU TOO. BYE.

520
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:13,600
- I'M READY.

521
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,067
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

522
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:16,800
- SO TONIGHT I HAVE
A LAMAZE CLASS.

523
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,100
I FEEL LIKE THIS CLASS
MIGHT BE A WASTE OF TIME,

524
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,300
BUT ALSO, WE MIGHT ACTUALLY
LEARN SOMETHING.

525
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,867
[breathing rhythmically]

526
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:24,767
- EW. PLEASE DO THAT
DURING THE CLASS TONIGHT.

527
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,167
- [laughs]
- I'LL BEG YOU.

528
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:27,867
- WHEN WE GET
TO LAMAZE CLASS,

529
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,200
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING
IT'S GONNA BE PACKED,

530
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,400
THIS IS GONNA BE LIKE
A CLASSROOM,

531
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,933
AND THERE'S ONLY
ONE COUPLE THERE.

532
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:34,667
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY,
A LOT OF PEOPLE

533
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:37,067
DON'T DO LAMAZE,
BECAUSE NO ONE'S THERE.

534
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,600
- WELCOME, AND CONGRATULATIONS
ON HAVING YOUR FIRST BABIES.

535
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,100
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING
I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT,

536
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
AT THE START AND END
OF EVERY CONTRACTION,

537
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,800
WHAT WE DO IS SOMETHING CALLED
THE CLEANSING BREATH.

538
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,500
THE CLEANSING BREATH
IS LIKE THIS.

539
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,967
[inhales]

540
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:53,633
AND OUT.
[exhales]

541
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:55,300
EVERYBODY WANT TO DO IT
WITH ME?

542
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,833
[all inhale, exhale]

543
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,067
- LAMAZE BREATHING
IS JUST SO STUPID.

544
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:01,267
YOU HAVE TO, LIKE,
BREATHE FOR FOUR COUNTS,

545
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,100
SO IT'S LIKE...
[inhales, exhales]

546
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,233
LIKE, WHO BREATHES LIKE THAT?

547
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,400
I'M NOT GONNA BREATHE
LIKE THAT.

548
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,333
I'M GONNA BE FREAKING OUT
WHEN I PUSH.

549
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:08,433
I'M NOT GONNA BE BREATHING
LIKE THAT.

550
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:09,500
I KNOW IT.

551
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,900
- IF YOU CHOOSE TO GET
AN EPIDURAL,

552
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:13,600
YOU'RE NUMB FROM HERE DOWN.

553
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,967
THEY'LL TAPE IT UP HERE--

554
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,067
YES?

555
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,400
- I READ STORIES WHERE

556
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,533
THEY GIVE YOU THE EPIDURAL,
BUT THEY MISS IT,

557
00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:21,933
AND THEN YOU'RE NUMB UP.

558
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,467
- NUMB UP?

559
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:25,800
- YEAH, INSTEAD OF DOWN.

560
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,467
- I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT HAPPEN.
- REALLY?

561
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:28,867
- SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD,
I'M SURE IT HAS.

562
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,433
I'VE NEVER--
- I READ IT ON GOOGLE.

563
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:33,067
I'VE USED GOOGLE A LOT
TO, LIKE, GOOGLE MY QUESTIONS.

564
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,400
LIKE, IT'S SCARY.

565
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,600
LIKE, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

566
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,667
- POSITIONING FOR LABOR
IS ANYTHING

567
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,100
THAT YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.

568
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,067
STANDING, KNEELING, SITTING...

569
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,500
- [whispers]
IS SHE, LIKE, POOPING?

570
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,700
- ALSO INDUCTION...

571
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,933
- [whispers]
THAT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE POOPING.

572
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:46,933
- IT IS SO AMAZING HOW...

573
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,333
WHEN YOU FIRST COME IN,

574
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:50,267
YOU'RE GONNA BE CHECKED,

575
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:51,767
AND YOUR DOCTOR OR NURSE--
YOU OKAY?

576
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:54,533
- [laughing]
CAN'T BREATHE.

577
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:57,067
OH, I'M GIGGLY TODAY.

578
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,600
- THE COUPLE NEXT TO US
RIGHT NOW

579
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,833
ARE TRYING TO LEARN LAMAZE,

580
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:02,067
AND NICOLE AND I
ARE LIKE JACKASSES,

581
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,633
LAUGHING, RUINING
THIS ENTIRE CLASS.

582
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,167
- IN THE EARLY PHASE OF LABOR,
YOU WANT TO STAY HOME

583
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:08,767
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

584
00:18:08,867 --> 00:18:10,300
- [giggling]
- YOU CAN ACTUALLY SHOWER--

585
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,967
YOU CAN ACTUALLY SHOWER
IF YOUR WATER BROKE.

586
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:14,500
UH, BUT YOU CANNOT TAKE
A BATH.

587
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,267
- I THINK THE OTHER COUPLE

588
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:17,300
THINKS, YOU KNOW,
ME AND JIONNI

589
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,533
ARE JUST LITTLE KIDS,

590
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:19,600
AND WE'RE IMMATURE.

591
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,067
WE WERE LAUGHING
THE WHOLE TIME.

592
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,567
- GOOD LUCK.
- GOOD LUCK. SEE YOU LATER.

593
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,133
- SEE YA. GOOD LUCK.

594
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,833
- BUT, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE JUST GONNA BE FUN PARENTS.

595
00:18:25,933 --> 00:18:27,300
SORRY THAT YOU'RE LAME.

596
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,400
- YOU SAID,
"I LIKE THAT POSE.

597
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,400
IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S POOPING."

598
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,533
- [laughing]
I KNOW.

599
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,233
- AND SHE WAS BENT OVER
ON ALL FOURS.

600
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,700
WHO POOPS ON ALL FOURS?

601
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,067
- UGH.

602
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,633
THIS IS SO GROSS.

603
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:41,700
THERE'S, LIKE,
[bleep] COMING OUT OF ME.

604
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,067
IT LOOKS LIKE
A BIG MUCUS BALL.

605
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:46,600
BABE!

606
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,833
I'M SCARED.

607
00:18:47,933 --> 00:18:50,433
- WHAT?
- I THINK MY WATER BROKE.

608
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,100
- * HOLD ON, HERE WE GO

609
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,533
- NOW WE JUST GOTTA LOOK
FOR MANDEE'S, DUDE.

610
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,067
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE IT IS.

611
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:01,100
- TODAY ME AND JENNI,
WE'RE GONNA GO SHOPPING,

612
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,133
BECAUSE I NEED AN OUTFIT
FOR THE HOSPITAL.

613
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:04,367
- OH, YEAH, THERE IT IS.

614
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:05,733
- AND RIGHT NOW,
I JUST NEED MY BEST FRIEND

615
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:07,067
BECAUSE I FEEL GROSS,

616
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:10,100
AND I FEEL LIKE
I JUST NEED GIRL TIME.

617
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,067
OOH! THIS IS
A REALLY NICE MANDEE'S.

618
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,333
- THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD,

619
00:19:14,433 --> 00:19:15,867
'CAUSE I NEED TO GO SHOPPING
FOR MAINE.

620
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:19,100
- UGH, I HATE BEING PREGNANT.

621
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,500
- AH, YOU'RE GONNA GIVE BIRTH
IN, LIKE, A COUPLE WEEKS.

622
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,967
- LOOK AT ALL THESE CLOTHES
I COULD BE WEARING.

623
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:25,333
[sighs]

624
00:19:25,433 --> 00:19:26,700
I'M IN SO MUCH PAIN.

625
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,133
- I HATE SEEING NICOLE
SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

626
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:31,067
I WOULD JUST BE UP AND LAYING
IN BED ALL THE TIME.

627
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,233
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S DOING
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

628
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,733
- ME NEITHER.
- [laughs]

629
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,600
WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY?

630
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,067
- THAT'S REALLY PRETTY.

631
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:44,533
TRY THEM BOTH ON.

632
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,100
- I DON'T WANT TO--
DO I HAVE TO TRY IT ON?

633
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,767
- MM-HMM.
- UGH.

634
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:49,300
I HATE YOU.

635
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,367
SO I'M TRYING ON
THIS LEOPARD DRESS

636
00:19:51,467 --> 00:19:53,467
THAT I MIGHT WEAR
TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL.

637
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,867
I CAN'T BREATHE.

638
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,067
- YEAH, BUT IT'S--

639
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,367
JUST PICTURE THE BELLY
NOT THERE.

640
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,333
- I KNOW.
- OH, YOU LOOK SO CUTE.

641
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:00,667
- I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

642
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,100
LIKE, WHEN YOU HAVE A BABY,
DOES IT GO DOWN AGAIN?

643
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,667
- YOU'LL AT LEAST LOSE
6 TO 8 POUNDS

644
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:06,700
BECAUSE OF THE BABY
AND PLACENTA.

645
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,000
- I JUST DEFINITELY HOPE
THAT THESE DRESSES

646
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,267
THAT I'M TRYING ON FIT.

647
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,933
I DON'T LIKE THAT FACE.

648
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,933
- I LOVE IT!
THAT'S GOTTA BE IT.

649
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:16,800
IF YOU WEREN'T GETTING IT,
I WOULD.

650
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,667
- WHAT IF I HAVE HIM
AND I STILL LOOK LIKE THIS?

651
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:21,667
- YOU'RE NOT.
- I'LL BE SO PISSED.

652
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:22,833
- [laughs]

653
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:24,267
[rustling]
- OOH.

654
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:25,433
I'M NOT KIDDING.

655
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:27,100
I AM IN SO MUCH PAIN
RIGHT NOW.

656
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,567
AS I'M CHANGING CLOTHES,

657
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,033
MY STOMACH STARTS
TO HURT.

658
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:32,300
I'M GETTING CRAMPS AGAIN.
I'M LIKE, "OH, [bleep]."

659
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,867
LIKE, I STILL HAVE TO DRIVE
LIKE TWO HOURS HOME.

660
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,600
WHAT IF I HAVE THIS BABY
IN THE CAR?

661
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,200
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

662
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,200
- THE NEXT PLACE
IS AN HOUR AND HALF AWAY.

663
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,267
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
- NO.

664
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,833
- I'M JUST SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

665
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:46,200
THANK YOU.

666
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,333
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

667
00:20:47,433 --> 00:20:48,367
- I KNOW.

668
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:50,033
- SO I FEEL REALLY BAD

669
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:51,567
BECAUSE I KNOW JENNI
REALLY WANTS TO GO

670
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,667
WEDDING DRESS SHOPPING,

671
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,467
BUT I HONESTLY CAN'T GO.

672
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,833
I HAVE NO ENERGY,
MY STOMACH HURTS,

673
00:20:56,933 --> 00:20:58,233
AND I JUST NEED
TO GET HOME AND REST

674
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,800
BECAUSE I JUST
DON'T FEEL RIGHT.

675
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,233
I HAD A BREAKDOWN
ON SUNDAY.

676
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,267
- WHY?
- I'M OVERWHELMED.

677
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,767
I'M TIRED OF BEING PREGNANT.

678
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:07,067
IT'S MISERABLE.

679
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,100
JIONNI'S FAMILY WAS OVER,
LIKE 20 PEOPLE.

680
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,100
AND THEN--

681
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,233
- DID YOU START CRYING?

682
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,700
- I JUST WANTED TO BE ALONE.

683
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,533
- DID YOU START CRYING?
- YEAH.

684
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:16,933
- I RAN DOWNSTAIRS
AND CRIED LIKE A TWO-YEAR-OLD.

685
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,067
- AWW.
- I CAN'T MOVE.

686
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:20,233
I CAN'T DO [bleep].

687
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,400
- DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

688
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,233
I KNOW IT SEEMS
LIKE FOREVER, BUT--

689
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,867
- THIS LAST MONTH
IS KILLING ME.

690
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:28,100
- UGH, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

691
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,967
AT LEAST YOU HAVE
THE PREGNANT EXCUSE.

692
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:33,867
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE [bleep]

ANY LABOR PAINS AT ALL, OR NO?

SO HOPEFULLY THEY'LL GET
A COUPLE PEOPLE DELIVERED

868
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:37,100
BY THE TIME YOU GO OVER THERE,

869
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,633
BUT YOU'RE STILL EARLY
IN THE PROCESS.

870
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:40,067
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE ANYWHERE
NEAR GETTING

871
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,200
AN EPIDURAL JUST YET.

872
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,067
NOW, LET ME JUST DO
AN EXAM FIRST.

873
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:45,133
- YEAH.
- SO YOU GUYS STEP OUT.

874
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:47,067
- I JUST LEAKED NOW,
SO YOU'RE GONNA SEE GROSSNESS.

875
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,300
- OKAY.

876
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,467
- ALL I WANT TO DO
IS HAVE THIS BABY.

877
00:27:49,567 --> 00:27:51,600
I'M TRYING TO KEEP CALM
AND, LIKE,

878
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,500
THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS.

879
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,667
BUT IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD,
I'M HONESTLY TERRIFIED.

880
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:56,833
- YOU ALL RIGHT? LET'S GO.
- [crying]

881
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:58,867
- SIT DOWN THERE.
- I'M SO SCARED.

882
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:02,233
- DON'T WORRY, BABE.
I PROMISE I'M HERE, OKAY?

883
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,867
THIS IS IT.

884
00:28:03,967 --> 00:28:05,133
- OKAY, WE'RE GOOD.

885
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,600
- THIS IS IT, LORENZO.
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

886
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,067
[laughter]

887
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:10,267
OH, [bleep].

888
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:11,333
THIS IS, LIKE,
THE SCARY PART,

889
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:14,367
WHERE THEY START PUTTING
I.V.s IN YOU,

890
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:16,200
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

891
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,167
SO I'M VERY, VERY SCARED,

892
00:28:18,267 --> 00:28:19,967
BUT I'M VERY RELIEVED
TO BE AT THE HOSPITAL.

893
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:21,067
- HOW YOU FEELING?

894
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,467
- I'M SCARED.

895
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:31,700
- ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS THE GAME PLAN.

896
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,233
I MEAN, YOU COULD WALK AROUND
AT HOME,

897
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:35,700
WALK YOURSELF INTO LABOR.

898
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,267
OTHERWISE, WE COULD HAVE YOU GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

899
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:38,767
RIGHT NOW,
SHE'S 1 CENTIMETER.

900
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:40,300
BUT YOU'RE STILL EARLY
IN THE PROCESS.

901
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,600
THIS COULD BE
ANOTHER 24 HOURS, OKAY?

902
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,200
- I DO NOT WANT TO BE IN LABOR
FOR MORE THAN, LIKE,

903
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,800
A DAY,
BECAUSE I'LL FREAK OUT.

904
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,333
LIKE, I CAN'T DEAL
WITH THIS [bleep].

905
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:49,967
- YOU KNOW, MOST OFTEN,
WHEN YOU GO INTO LABOR,

906
00:28:50,067 --> 00:28:52,067
YOU BREAK YOUR WATER, YOU START
TO CONTRACT RIGHT AWAY.

907
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,100
YOU START TO DILATE.

908
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,867
RIGHT NOW,
YOU BROKE YOUR WATER,

909
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,400
BUT NOW YOU NEED--JUST NEED
SOME STRONGER CONTRACTIONS--

910
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,067
- DO YOU THINK
IT'LL TAKE A WHILE?

911
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,467
- YEAH.

912
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,567
- I WANT THIS TO BE
AS COMFORTABLE FOR NICOLE.

913
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:03,067
WE'LL JUST GO
BACK TO THE HOUSE,

914
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:04,533
WAIT IT OUT A LITTLE BIT,
AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO,

915
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:05,933
AND THEN WE'LL GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

916
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:08,067
- IT'S GONNA BE
A LONG DAY.

917
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:10,633
GONNA BE IN LABOR
FOR LIKE 24 HOURS.

918
00:29:10,733 --> 00:29:12,933
THIS IS BULL[bleep].

919
00:29:17,933 --> 00:29:19,133
- FALSE ALARM.

920
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:20,333
- YEAH, RIGHT.

921
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:23,100
FALSE ALARM MY ASS.

922
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,567
OUCH.

923
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,067
LORENZO'S DEFINITELY
PISSING ME OFF.

924
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,600
I FIGURED HE WOULD WANT
TO COME OUT AND MEET ME,

925
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,300
BUT HE'S STILL, LIKE,
CHILLING IN MY WOMB,

926
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,200
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE DOESN'T WANT TO COME OUT.

927
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,067
I'M GONNA CALL JENNI.

928
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:39,100
[line ringing]

929
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
- HELLO?

930
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,933
- HEY, BOO.
- HEY, GOOD MORNING.

931
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:44,133
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

932
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:45,667
- NOTHING,
JUST GOT TO THE GYM.

933
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:46,667
YOU SOUND TIRED.

934
00:29:46,767 --> 00:29:48,233
- MY WATER BROKE.

935
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,800
- WHAT? YOU'RE LYING.

936
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,133
- I SWEAR TO GOD.

937
00:29:51,233 --> 00:29:53,133
BUT I'M STILL 1 CENTIMETER,

938
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:55,133
BUT I HAVE CONTRACTIONS,
AND THEY HURT LIKE A BITCH,

939
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:57,400
AND I'M PROBABLY GONNA GO
TO THE HOSPITAL

940
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,833

00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:01,067

942
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,167
- HOLY [bleep].

943
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,333
- OH, I'M, LIKE,
IN TEARS RIGHT NOW.

944
00:30:04,433 --> 00:30:05,833
[laughs]

945
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:07,900
- YEAH.
- I'M SO EXCITED.

946
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,433
- THAT'S AWESOME.
I'M EXCITED FOR YOU.

947
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:11,333
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL TEXT YOU
IN A LITTLE BIT.

948
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:13,600
- LOVE YOU.
I'M SO EXCITED.

949
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,900
- DON'T POOP.
- LOVE YOU, BYE.

950
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,900
IDIOT.

951
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,900
- BYE.

952
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,400
- THAT IS CRAZY.

953
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,700
THAT'S EARLY.
- C-SECTION.

954
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,933
- SO YOU WANNA JUST SAY
SCREW THE GYM

955
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:23,500
AND GO GET READY?

956
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,700
- OKAY, LET'S GO.

957
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
- SHE'S GONNA POOP, THOUGH.
I KNOW IT.

958
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,267
- [laughing]
STOP.

959
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:29,467
I'M SO EXCITED
FOR NICOLE RIGHT NOW.

960
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:31,167
SO ALL I WANT TO DO
IS GET UP THERE.

961
00:30:31,267 --> 00:30:33,000
I WANT TO GET EVERYTHING THAT
WE NEED AND GET ON THE ROAD

962
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,700
TO EAST HANOVER.

963
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,300
- UGH.
- I DON'T KNOW HOW

964
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,233
SHE'S NOT SWINGING AND PUNCHING
EVERYBODY RIGHT NOW.

965
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,333
[laughs]

966
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:44,733
- MOM, SHUT UP.

967
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:48,467
- THE WAITING GAME.
- YEP.

968
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:50,133
- I HAVE TO POOP.

969
00:30:50,233 --> 00:30:51,400
- OH.

970
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
- MAKE SURE
THAT'S ALL YOU DO.

971
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,500
[laughs]

972
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,533
- DON'T PUSH TOO HARD.
- EW.

973
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:58,067
- [laughs]
- YOUR MOTHER AND I

974
00:30:58,167 --> 00:31:01,067
ARE GONNA START DRINKING
HERE PRETTY SOON.

975
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:03,300
- ME AND YOU BOTH, PAL.

976
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,633
IT'S ALL DOWNHILL
FROM HERE.

977
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:09,067
- I'M GONNA PICK UP
A BASSINETTE

978
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,900
AND A DIAPER CHANGER
FOR HER.

979
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:12,367
- AND YOU WANT TO STOP
AND GET CIGARS,

980
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:13,567
YOU WANT TO STOP
AND GET SWEET FRUIT,

981
00:31:13,667 --> 00:31:14,633
AND YOU WANT A TWO-HOUR RIDE
UP THERE.

982
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:16,233
PHEW. AWESOME. OKAY.

983
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:17,433
- WE'RE GONNA GRAB IT.

984
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:18,533
IT'LL TAKE ME TWO SECONDS
TO RUN IN THERE.

985
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:19,633
I'M GONNA GRAB
A DIAPER CHANGER.

986
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:20,833
I'M GONNA GRAB
A BASSINETTE.

987
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,300
- WE DON'T HAVE TIME
TO GO GET SWEETS.

988
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,100
- WE'RE FINE.

989
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,933
- ALL RIGHT.

990
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:28,167
- SO--
- IF WE'RE NOT FINE,

991
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:30,433
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY BITCHING.

992
00:31:30,533 --> 00:31:31,967
WHATEVER YOU WOULD LIKE.

993
00:31:32,067 --> 00:31:35,067
- THANK YOU.
THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.

994
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:39,100
[line ringing]

995
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,300
- HELLO?
- HEY, DOC, WHAT'S GOING ON?

996
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,067
- HOW'S SHE DOING?
- GOOD.

997
00:31:43,133 --> 00:31:45,867
- SAME THING, JUST, YOU KNOW,
EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

998
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:47,400
PAIN'S ABOUT THE SAME.

999
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,933
- YOU GUYS WANT
TO SHOOT OVER?

1000
00:31:49,067 --> 00:31:50,533
YOU KNOW, IF SHE'S STILL NOT
DILATED THAT MUCH,

1001
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:52,300
WE'LL PROBABLY DO
THAT BALLOON THING.

1002
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,100
- SO DR. RUSSO IS SAYING
HE MIGHT HAVE TO INDUCE ME.

1003
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,800
SO BASICALLY, HE MIGHT HAVE
TO PUT A BALLOON

1004
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,767
IN MY CERVIX TO EXPAND IT

1005
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:01,700
SO THE BABY CAN COME OUT.

1006
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,067
I'M HOPING IT'S NOT, LIKE,

1007
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:05,700
A HUGE, LIKE,
BIRTHDAY PARTY BALLOON.

1008
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,167
- IF SHE GETS UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH THAT,

1009
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:08,567
SHE CAN GET HER EPIDURAL.

1010
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,467
I'M HERE RIGHT NOW, SO YOU GUYS
CAN COME ON OVER, OKAY?

1011
00:32:10,567 --> 00:32:11,967
- AWESOME. THANKS, DR. RUSSO.
I APPRECIATE IT.

1012
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:13,267
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.

1013
00:32:13,367 --> 00:32:14,333
- ALL RIGHT, BYE.
- BYE-BYE.

1014
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,600
- HERE WE GO.
THIS IS IT.

1015
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,767
MY BABY'S COMING TONIGHT.

1016
00:32:17,867 --> 00:32:19,333
- GIVE ME A HUG...
- WE'RE ALL HERE.

1017
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:21,267
- BEFORE I BECOME GRANDMA,
AND I'M NOT JUST MOMMY.

1018
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:23,633
- I'M EXCITED,
BUT I'M REALLY NERVOUS.

1019
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,667
AND--PFFT.

1020
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:26,800
IT'S NERVE-RACKING.

1021
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,167
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS SOON.

1022
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:29,167
- ALL RIGHT.
- BYE.

1023
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:30,300
- GOOD LUCK.

1024
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,067
WE'LL SEE YOUSE THERE.

1025
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:33,767
- * CAN'T IGNORE IT

1026
00:32:33,867 --> 00:32:35,633
* IT'S UNDERNEATH YOUR SKIN

1027
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:39,300
* IT'S NOT THE END

1028
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,567
* THIS IS WHERE WE BEGIN

1029
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:44,233
- JUST IMAGINE,

1030
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:47,067
OUR KID IS GONNA BE OUT
BY TONIGHT.

1031
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,267
- HOPEFULLY.

1032
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,333
- HE'LL BE OUT.

1033
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:53,200
- THEN WHAT?
WE JUST GO HOME AND, LIKE,

1034
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
TAKE CARE OF HIM?

1035
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,867
- THAT'S IT.
THEN HE'S OURS.

1036
00:32:56,967 --> 00:32:58,633
- * WE CAN'T LOSE

1037
00:32:58,733 --> 00:33:00,767
- LET'S DO THIS.

1038
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:02,100
IT'S LIKE WE'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT

1039
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,300
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS
AND MONTHS.

1040
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,633
NOW'S THE TIME.

1041
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,233
LIKE, IT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

1042
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,467
THERE'S NO TURNING BACK.

1043
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:08,600
IT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

1044
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,367
THIS IS IT.

1045
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:11,967
- OKAY.
- THIS IS IT, LORENZO.

1046
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:13,367
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

1047
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:15,500
[laughter]

1048
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,533
OH, [bleep].

1049
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:17,800
THIS IS, LIKE,
THE SCARY PART,

1050
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,467
WHERE THEY START PUTTING
I.V.s IN YOU.

1051
00:33:20,567 --> 00:33:23,133
SO I'M VERY, VERY SCARED,

1052
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:26,267
BUT I'M VERY RELIEVED
TO BE AT THE HOSPITAL.

1053
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:28,900
- HOW YOU FEELING?

1054
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:30,867
ALMOST TIME
FOR THE EPIDURAL.

1055
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,167
- I'M SCARED.

1056
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:33,933
- AND THEN OUR SON COMES.

1057
00:33:34,067 --> 00:33:36,267
- CAN I SEE THIS?

1058
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:39,300
- WHY?
- LET ME SEE IT.

1059
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,267
HI, DAD.

1060
00:33:43,367 --> 00:33:45,067
- HI, BUDDY.

1061
00:33:45,167 --> 00:33:46,233
- SAY SOMETHING TO HIM.

1062
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:47,567
- I SAID, "HI, BUDDY."

1063
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:50,200
- THAT'S IT?
- I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU.

1064
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,567
MOMMY'S DOING GOOD.

1065
00:33:53,667 --> 00:33:56,633
- MOMMY HURTS. OUCH.

1066
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,633
- HOW ARE YOU?

1067
00:34:02,733 --> 00:34:03,733
- I'M SCARED.

1068
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:04,800
- THIS DOOR?
- YEAH.

1069
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,067
[knock at door]

1070
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:08,600
- HI.
- HI.

1071
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,733
- BOO-BOO.

1072
00:34:10,833 --> 00:34:11,733
- AW.

1073
00:34:11,833 --> 00:34:12,933
- THANKS FOR COMING, PAL.

1074
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:13,967
- YEAH, MAN.
- HOW ARE YOU?

1075
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:14,933
- ABSOLUTELY.
- OKAY.

1076
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:16,733
- YOUR MAKEUP'S BEAUTIFUL.

1077
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:17,933
THE FIRST THING I NOTICE
IS HOW GLAMORIZED

1078
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:19,333
NICOLE LOOKS.

1079
00:34:19,433 --> 00:34:21,067
- I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

1080
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:22,333
- SHE'S IN A LEOPARD GOWN.

1081
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:23,767
HER HAIR AND MAKEUP'S DONE.

1082
00:34:23,867 --> 00:34:25,733
I'M LIKE, WHAT, ARE YOU
GOING OUT TO DINNER?

1083
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,167
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY
FOR ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH.

1084
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:28,267
- YOU DO.
I WAS THINKING--

1085
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:30,800
- LIKE--
- YOU LOOK LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.

1086
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,133
- GOOD, THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO FEEL, TO LOOK LIKE.

1087
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:34,167
- [laughing]

1088
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:35,267
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?

1089
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,533
- SHE DIDN'T POOP YET.

1090
00:34:36,633 --> 00:34:38,067
- YOU'RE GONNA POOP,
JUST FOR THE RECORD.

1091
00:34:38,133 --> 00:34:40,100
[grunts]

1092
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,233
YOU READY FOR THIS, BUDDY?

1093
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:42,833
- OH, YEAH.
- THIS IS CRAZY.

1094
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:43,933
- CAN'T WAIT.
- THIS IS EARLY.

1095
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:46,067
- THIS IS IT.
- THIS IS IT.

1096
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,467
- THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW.
[laughs]

1097
00:34:47,567 --> 00:34:49,567
- NO. NO.

1098
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:51,067
- THERE'S A BALLOON
IN MY VAGINA.

1099
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,333
- [laughs]

1100
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:54,467
- YOU'VE HAD STRANGER THINGS
IN YOUR VAGINA.

1101
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:56,067
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

1102
00:34:56,133 --> 00:34:58,633
- [laughs]

1103
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:00,067
YOU GUYS WANT US
TO LEAVE YOU BE, OR--

1104
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,067
- YEAH, WE'LL GO OUT
FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

1105
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,067
- YEAH.
- GO, UH--

1106
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,367
YEAH, GO OUTSIDE.
HANG OUT.

1107
00:35:04,467 --> 00:35:05,733
I'LL CALL MY DAD TO TELL HIM
YOU'RE COMING.

1108
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,433
- OKAY. COOL, COOL.
- ALL RIGHT.

1109
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:08,500
- THANKS FOR COMING.
- THANK YOU.

1110
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,633
- ABSOLUTELY, BRO.

1111
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:10,800
WE'LL GIVE YOU GUYS
SOME PRIVACY.

1112
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,633
- APPRECIATE IT.

1113
00:35:12,733 --> 00:35:14,633
- I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
LORENZO FOR A WHILE,

1114
00:35:14,733 --> 00:35:16,867
SO JUST GO TO
OUR MAN-CAVE/NURSERY

1115
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:18,933
AND JUST CHILL OUT
AND, YOU KNOW,

1116
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:21,233
TAKE A NAP OR SOMETHING.

1117
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,300
I'M OVERWHELMED.

1118
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,667
- I KNOW.
YOU SHOULD BE.

1119
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:25,700
- THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF
GOING ON.

1120
00:35:29,533 --> 00:35:31,667
- THERE'S MORE SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW
ON THE WAY...

1121
00:35:31,767 --> 00:35:33,833
- AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

1122
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,433
- ME AND ROGER GOT NICOLE
A BASSINETTE FOR LORENZO

1123
00:35:41,533 --> 00:35:42,700
AND A CHANGING TABLE.

1124
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,200
THE LEAST I CAN DO IS PUT
A LITTLE THINGS TOGETHER

1125
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,633
TO HELP NICOLE
UNTIL HER OTHER FURNITURE COMES.

1126
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:49,967
- HEY, THERE HE IS.
- HI.

1127
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:51,067
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD, HOW YOU DOING?

1128
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:52,267
- WE BOUGHT, UM,

1129
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:54,267
A CRIB AND A DIAPER CHANGE
TEMPORARILY

1130
00:35:54,367 --> 00:35:56,267
FOR HER TO HAVE DOWN THERE
FOR WHEN THEY GET HOME.

1131
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:57,767
- THE CRIB IS COMING.
- OH, I KNOW.

1132
00:35:57,867 --> 00:35:59,167
THIS ONE'S FOR THURSDAY.

1133
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:01,267
- YEAH, BUT--
- BUT IT'S A SURPRISE FOR THEM.

1134
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,133
- GOOD LUCK. GO AHEAD.
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

1135
00:36:03,233 --> 00:36:04,200
- THERE YOU GO.

1136
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,700
- YOU COULD PUT IT UP,

1137
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,367
BUT THEN YOU COULD
TAKE IT DOWN.

1138
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,567
- JANIS IS DEFINITELY
A LITTLE SAUCY RIGHT NOW,

1139
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,300
BUT THE BABY ROOM YOU CREATED
IS TWO FLOORS UP.

1140
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,667
I CANNOT IMAGINE NICOLE

1141
00:36:13,767 --> 00:36:16,200
GOING TWO FLOORS
TO CHANGE LORENZO

1142
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,567
FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

1143
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:18,767
I'M [bleep] SETTING IT UP.

1144
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:21,067
- WHY DO I GET ROPED
INTO THIS [bleep]?

1145
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,867
- [grunts]

1146
00:36:26,967 --> 00:36:28,933
[sighs]

1147
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,167
WHOA, IF YOU'RE
AT ALL ANNOYED,

1148
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:35,733
I WILL DO THIS MYSELF.
- YOU WON'T DO IT YOURSELF,

1149
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:37,067
'CAUSE YOU COULDN'T DO IT
YOURSELF, AND YOU KNOW--

1150
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:38,300
- I DO ALL THE PROJECTS
IN OUR HOUSE,

1151
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,433
ALL THE THINGS BUILDING.

1152
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,267
I BUILD ALL THE TIME
IN OUR HOUSE.

1153
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,700
- I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

1154
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,167
I CAN BE GRUMPY AT TIMES,
YOU KNOW.

1155
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:49,067
ESPECIALLY IF I'M HUNGRY.

1156
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,067
UH, OR AWAKE AT ALL.

1157
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:02,367
- IT'S BEEN ABOUT 24 HOURS NOW

1158
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:04,400
SINCE NICOLE'S BEEN IN LABOR,

1159
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,733
AND I JUST WANNA [bleep]
MEET LORENZO AT THIS POINT.

1160
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,100
- I THINK I HAVE TO POOP.

1161
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,367
- OH, GOD.

1162
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:10,967
- THAT MIGHT BE
A CONTRACTION.

1163
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:12,500
THAT MIGHT MEAN YOU'RE IN--
- EW, IT'S IN MY VAGINA.

1164
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,600
I DON'T LIKE IT.
WHERE'S THAT BUTTON?

1165
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,300
[beeping]

1166
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,967
- OH, BOY.
SHE'S NUMBING IT.

1167
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,567
- WHAT'S IN YOUR VAGINA?

1168
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:21,967
- PAIN.
- IT JUST FEELS LIKE PRESSURE.

1169
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:24,433
- SO THAT JUST NUMBED IT.

1170
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,067
- THAT MIGHT NOT BE POOP.
THAT MIGHT BE THE BABY.

1171
00:37:27,167 --> 00:37:28,567
- I KNOW, THAT'S WHY
I JUST PUSHED THE BUTTON.

1172
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,367
[laughter]
- YOU GETTING NERVOUS?

1173
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:31,800
- NO.
- NO, SHE--

1174
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,400
- PUSH HIM OUT.
LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

1175
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,433
I WANT TO MEET HIM.

1176
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:37,967
- I REALLY HAD TO TAKE
A HUGE [bleep].

1177
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:39,633
- WOW.
- YEAH, LIKE, BIG.

1178
00:37:39,733 --> 00:37:41,067
- LIKE A 6.5-POUND [bleep].

1179
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,800
- LIKE A [bleep]
THAT DOESN'T BREAK,

1180
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,833
AND IT KEEPS TWIRLING.

1181
00:37:43,933 --> 00:37:45,100
- UGH.
- THAT TYPE OF [bleep].

1182
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,833
- IT'S LIKE THE DAY AFTER
GOING OUT

1183
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:47,867
TO THE CLUB TYPE OF [bleep].

1184
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:49,467
- OH, YEAH,
AFTER-KARMA [bleep].

1185
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,200
NOW, HOW AM I GONNA FEEL IT?

1186
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,367
LIKE, WHAT'S IT GONNA FEEL LIKE
WITH THE EPIDURAL?

1187
00:37:53,467 --> 00:37:54,567
JUST SO I KNOW.

1188
00:37:54,667 --> 00:37:55,667
- YOU'RE GONNA FEEL PRESSURE,

1189
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:56,967
LIKE YOU HAVE TO MOVE
YOUR BOWELS.

1190
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,133
AND THEN THE BABY--

1191
00:37:58,233 --> 00:37:59,567
- SO WHEN HE'S COMING OUT,
LIKE,

1192
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:01,533
DOES IT HURT,
OR IS IT MORE LIKE--

1193
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:02,867
- UM--
- LIKE [bleep]?

1194
00:38:02,967 --> 00:38:04,500
- YOU'LL FEEL A STRETCH--
A STRETCHING.

1195
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,500
- OH, [bleep].
I'M SCARED.

1196
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,967
- DON'T BE.
YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

1197
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:09,767
- I MIGHT POOP.
- THAT'S OKAY.

1198
00:38:09,867 --> 00:38:10,867
- OKAY.

1199
00:38:10,967 --> 00:38:12,667
[bleep], I'M NERVOUS.

1200
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:13,733
- YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

1201
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,900
- WE'RE STEPPING OUT.

1202
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:16,400
- IT'S BEEN A LONG NIGHT
FOR EVERYBODY,

1203
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,833
ESPECIALLY NICOLE,

1204
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:20,667
AND THIS CHILDBIRTH
IS REALLY KIND OF GOING

1205
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:22,467
INTO THE TENTH HOUR
AT THIS POINT.

1206
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:23,700
AND WE'RE JUST KILLING TIME,

1207
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,167
WAITING FOR THIS BABY
TO ARRIVE.

1208
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:29,733
- MY BACK HURTS.
TAKE CARE OF ME.

1209
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:30,967
STOP.

1210
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:33,600
STOP. STOP MAKING ME
UNCOMFORTABLE.

1211
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,667
- [laughing]

1212
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:45,167
IT'S A LITTLE ODD
TO DO THIS IN A HOSPITAL,

1213
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:47,267
BUT...

1214
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,400
IF YOU'RE GAME, I'M GAME.

1215
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,433
I'M GONNA KEEP
THE ROMANCE ALIVE.

1216
00:38:54,567 --> 00:38:56,367
HOW'S THAT NIPPLE DOING,
JUST HANGING OUT?

1217
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:57,967
- WHICH ONE IS--
IT'S NOT HANGING OUT.

1218
00:38:58,067 --> 00:38:59,067
- [laughing]
YES, IT IS.

1219
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,067
- WHY ARE YOU MAKING IT
AWKWARD FOR ME?

1220
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,733
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LOVE ME?

1221
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:07,133
- [laughing and snorting]

1222
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:09,133
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO ALWAYS
[bleep] WITH ME.

1223
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:10,600
SOMETIMES I JUST NEED LOVE.

1224
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,733
- I GIVE YOU LOVES, MONKEY.
I GIVE YOU LOVES.

1225
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:16,767
[door creaks]

1226
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:18,433
- HOW YOU DOING?
FEELING SOME PRESSURE?

1227
00:39:18,533 --> 00:39:19,600
- THINK I'M GONNA [bleep]
MY PANTS.

1228
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,367
- OH, THAT'S NOT TOO GOOD.
OKAY.

1229
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:22,767
- NO, LIKE, FOR REAL.
I DIDN'T GO TODAY.

1230
00:39:22,867 --> 00:39:24,167
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

1231
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:27,100
- LET'S HOPE
IT'S THE BABY'S HEAD, OKAY?

1232
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,300
- NO, IT'S, LIKE,
IN MY BUTT HOLE.

1233
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,267
- WELL, THE BABY'S RIGHT ON TOP
OF THAT AREA.

1234
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:32,600
- LIKE, NO ONE BELIEVES ME.

1235
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,533
I REALLY HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM RIGHT NOW.

1236
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,767
BUT DR. RUSSO SAYS
IT'S LORENZO

1237
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:37,900
TRYING TO COME OUT,
BUT I--

1238
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:39,067
IT'S IN MY BUTT.

1239
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:41,800
LIKE, I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE
A TURD.

1240
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,233
- WELL, YOU'RE ALMOST
FULLY DILATED.

1241
00:39:44,333 --> 00:39:45,733
- [groans]

1242
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,167
I'M GONNA POOP, I SWEAR.

1243
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:48,367
- THE BABY'S DOWN
MUCH LOWER NOW,

1244
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:49,667
AND THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE FEELING.

1245
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:50,933
- IT HURTS.
- OKAY?

1246
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:53,267
SO YOU'RE ABOUT AT 9,
9 1/2 CENTIMETERS.

1247
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:55,067
ALL RIGHT, THE HEAD'S STARTING
TO AT LEAST COME DOWN

1248
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:56,700
OVER THE LAST HOUR,
HOUR AND HALF.

1249
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,400
YOU HAVING A CONTRACTION NOW?

1250
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,000
- YEAH, IT HURTS.

1251
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,467
- COULD BE THE BABY.
- IT'S THE BABY'S HEAD.

1252
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,067
- JUST THINK, BABE.

1253
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,500
HE'S ALMOST HERE.

1254
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,133
- NOTHING TO BE SCARED ABOUT.
YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

1255
00:40:08,233 --> 00:40:10,367
- NEXT TIME YOU SEE ME,
I'LL BE IN SCRUBS, ALL RIGHT?

1256
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:11,667
- I'M JUST SCARED.
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK.

1257
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:15,967
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME TALK.

1258
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,933
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE, HON.
OKAY?

1259
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,467
- [breathing shakily]

1260
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:22,000
YOU'RE MAKING ME SO STRESSED.

1261
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,400
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

1262
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,733
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- YOU'RE GONNA DO GREAT.

1263
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:26,100
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

1264
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,367
- THIS IS NOT NORMAL.
- OKAY, OKAY.

1265
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,767
- NICOLE, YOU'RE DOING AWESOME.
YOU'RE DOING AWESOME, OKAY?

1266
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,267
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH,
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH.

1267
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:35,833
NICOLE, YOU'RE A PRO.

1268
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,200
- THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE,
YOU DEFINITELY HAVE MOMENTS

1269
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,633
YOU'RE NEVER,
EVER GONNA FORGET.

1270
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:41,300
BUT NOTHING, BY FAR,
COMPARES TO THIS.

1271
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,533
- MM-HMM.
- NOTHING.

1272
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:43,900
- THERE WE GO.
LITTLE MORE, LITTLE MORE.

1273
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,233
- [whimpers]
[baby crying]

1274
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,167
- [sobbing]
BABY'S HERE.

1275
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:49,167
[baby crying]

1276
00:40:49,267 --> 00:40:52,600
- ROGER WANTS TO DO IT
THE MORE TRADITIONAL WAY,

1277
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,100
WHICH IS GET ENGAGED.

1278
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,900
- I'M KIND OF GETTING TAG-TEAMED
HERE A LITTLE BIT BY EVERYBODY.

1279
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,333
- NOW I JUST NEED A RING.
