1
00:00:03,267 --> 00:00:04,667
- ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

2
00:00:04,767 --> 00:00:06,400
- NO, I'M NOT READY.
- ME EITHER!

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,067
SINCE I LEFT THE SHORE,

4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:10,533
MY AND JIONNI ARE LIVING
WITH HIS PARENTS.

5
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:13,133
WE HAVE A NICE APARTMENT
DOWNSTAIRS.

6
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:14,567
- CAN YOU GUYS STRAIGHTEN UP
A LITTLE BIT?

7
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:15,900
SOPHIE'S COMING DOWN
IN A COUPLE MINUTES.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,533
- WHY DO WE GOTTA CLEAN
FOR THE CLEANING LADY?

9
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:19,900
- SO SHE DOESN'T THINK
YOU'RE SLOPPY.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,767
- JANIS IS LIKE
THE SUPER MOM,

11
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:23,033
AND I DEFINITELY ADMIRE THAT
ABOUT HER,

12
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,533
'CAUSE I WANT TO BE
LIKE THAT AS A MOM.

13
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,033
- THIS IS REALLY CRAZY.

14
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,567
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE HAVING A KID.

15
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,167
- IT DIDN'T HIT US YET.

16
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:30,533
- THE BELLY DIDN'T DO IT
FOR YOU?

17
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,033
- NO, IT JUST FEELS LIKE
AN ACCESSORY ON ME.

18
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,733
BUT ME AND JIONNI
ARE BASICALLY CLUELESS.

19
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:35,200
- REALISTICALLY,
NEITHER ONE OF US

20
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,733
KNOW HOW TO HANDLE
A NEWBORN.

21
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,533
- WOULD YOU AND JIONNI BE
RIGHT NOW?

22
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:40,733
- ENGAGED?
- IF YOU WEREN'T PREGNANT?

23
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:42,567
- PROBABLY NOT.

24
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,267
[both laugh]

25
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:46,667
- SINCE ME AND NICOLE
HAVE LEFT THE SHORE,

26
00:00:46,767 --> 00:00:48,667
I'M LIVING WITH ROGER.

27
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:51,000
ONE DAY WILL YOU PROPOSE?
- ONE DAY.

28
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,467
NO PRESSURE FROM ANYBODY.

29
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:53,867
- IF I HAVE TO WAIT
FOR YOUR PACE,

30
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:55,433
I'LL BE WAITING
TILL I'M 50.

31
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:58,133
I WOULD LIKE A RING,
A VERY FAT, JUICY RING,

32
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:01,067
BUT NO PRESSURE.

33
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,167
- NO PRESSURE.

34
00:01:04,267 --> 00:01:06,533
- ME AND NICOLE--
WE TALK ALL THE TIME.

35
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,433
IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE NOT
ABLE TO SEE EACH OTHER

36
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:09,900
LIKE WE DID IN JERSEY CITY,

37
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,933
DUE TO THE FACT THAT
SHE'S UP NORTH, AND I'M SOUTH.

38
00:01:13,067 --> 00:01:14,133
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

39
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,933
- CLEANING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

40
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:17,633
- NOTHING.
ABOUT TO GET IN THE SHOWER.

41
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:19,067
JUST WANTED TO SAY HI.

42
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:20,700
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD BE THIS HARD.

43
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,967
- IT SUCKS.
- MM-HMM.

44
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,333
- BUT WE'RE STILL BEST FRIENDS.
- STILL.

45
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,367
- AND, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE STILL CRAZY BITCHES.

46
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:27,500
I WENT
TO THE DOCTOR'S TODAY.

47
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,067
- HOW IS THE VAGINA FEELING?

48
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,900
- I'M JUST, I GUESS,
PREPARING TO GIVE BIRTH.

49
00:01:32,067 --> 00:01:33,333
- I STILL WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH YOU, THOUGH.

50
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:34,467
- OH, ME TOO.
- BEFORE [bleep] CHANGES.

51
00:01:34,567 --> 00:01:35,800
YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE
A BABY.

52
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,700
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GO
ON YOUR DUE DATE,

53
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,600
OR DO YOU ACTUALLY THINK
YOU'RE GONNA GO BEFORE IT?

54
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,833
- WE DON'T HAVE
OUR FURNITURE,

55
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,667
SO I KIND OF
DON'T WANT TO RUSH IT.

56
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,967
- [bleep] YOUR FURNITURE.
LET'S MEET LORENZO.

57
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:46,467
- YAY.

58
00:01:46,567 --> 00:01:48,933
- * I DON'T CARE

59
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,467
* I LOVE IT

60
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,500
* I DON'T CARE

61
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,400
* I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT

62
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,533
* I DON'T CARE

63
00:01:56,633 --> 00:01:57,533
* I LOVE IT

64
00:01:57,633 --> 00:01:59,367
*

65
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,400
* I DON'T CARE

66
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,533
[upbeat music]

67
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:06,100
- * LIFE IS WONDERFUL

68
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,467
* YEAH, IT'S GREAT

69
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:09,767
* YEAH-EAH-EAH

70
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:12,667
- EW! WHEN YOU LAUGH,
YOUR BELLY BUTTON POPS OUT.

71
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:13,933
- NO.
- DO IT AGAIN.

72
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,800
- RIGHT NOW
I'M EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT,

73
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,533
AND I'M JUST TIRED
OF BEING PREGNANT.

74
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:20,867
- DO IT AGAIN.
- NO.

75
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:22,833
- PLEASE.
- [laughs]

76
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:25,500
HOPEFULLY, OUR DELIVERY
WILL BE SOON.

77
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,233
I FEEL LIKE
IT'S TAKING FOREVER,

78
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,167
BUT I'M DEFINITELY
NERVOUS ABOUT IT

79
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:31,100
BECAUSE IT CAN RIP YOU,
AND YOU CAN POOP

80
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,567
AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF.

81
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,233
- GO, PUSH ON IT. EW!
NICOLE, I'M NOT KIDDING.

82
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,600
- [groans]
- STOP, STOP.

83
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,100
- I'M GONNA POOP.
- [laughs]

84
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,567
- I WOULD SAY WE LIVE
IN A MAN CAVE,

85
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:46,733
AND I KIND OF LIKE IT,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

86
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,533
WE HAVE A LOT TO DO.

87
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:51,067
- I WANT THE CRIB
ALONG THIS CORNER.

88
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,533
WE GOT TO...

89
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:55,600
- SET UP EVERYTHING,
MAKING IT, LIKE, BABY-PROOF.

90
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,333
- WE'RE GONNA MIX
THE TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.

91
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:58,900
IT'S GONNA BE A MAN CAVE
WITH A BABY.

92
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:01,333
- A MAN CAVE FROM THE BAR
TO THE KITCHEN, OVER.

93
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:03,833
- ALWAYS NEED A BAR.
- WELL, NOT IN A NURSERY.

94
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,333
- YOU CAN HANG
THE BABY BOTTLES ON THE BAR.

95
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:10,067
- YES, YOU CAN.

96
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:11,933
[laughs]

97
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,333
SURE YOU WANT TO DRIVE?
- YEAH.

98
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:19,667
- SO TODAY WE'RE GOING TO GO
SHOPPING FOR THE BABY,

99
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:21,367
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANY SHOPPING YET.

100
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,533
WE HAVE NOTHING.

101
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:25,600
MY, LIKE, BOOB IS OUT.

102
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,700
- * PA-PA-PAPA SAID,
"BOY, NOW, BE SOMETHING" *

103
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,300
* AND MA-MA-MAMA SAID,
"STAY AT HOME AND BE NOTHIN'" *

104
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,267
*

105
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,800
- WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO GET?

106
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,900
- A THINGY TO PUT
ALL THE [bleep] ON.

107
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,300
- HUH?

108
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,933
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT BABY FURNITURE.

109
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,133
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO GET.

110
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:44,067
- THAT'S WHY I TOLD YOU
TO READ THE BOOKS,

111
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,533
SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?

112
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,700
I JUST KNOW WE'RE EIGHT MONTHS.
YOU'RE DUE IN A MONTH.

113
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,467
AND LET'S [bleep]
GET THROUGH THIS.

114
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,267
- OH, WOW.
- OOH.

115
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:58,667
- THIS IS CUTE.

116
00:03:58,767 --> 00:04:00,167
- I'M MICHELLE.
WELCOME TO BELLINI.

117
00:04:00,267 --> 00:04:01,467
- HI. NICOLE.
- HI.

118
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:02,567
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?
JIONNI.

119
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:04,400
- WHAT CAN I HELP YOU GUYS
WITH TODAY?

120
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,067
- UM...
- EVERYTHING.

121
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,633
- EVERYTHING?
- YEAH, WE NEED A NICE SET.

122
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,800
- LET'S GO OVER HERE.

123
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,133
SO WE HAVE THE DARK,
DARK ESPRESSO.

124
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,367
- YEAH, I THINK
WE LIKE THIS.

125
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:14,967
- I DON'T HAVE MUCH SAY
ON--ON THE COLORS

126
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,500
OR WHAT TO PICK RIGHT NOW.

127
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,500
- YES, YOU DO.
- I DO?

128
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,067
- THIS IS A CHANGING TABLE?
- RIGHT.

129
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,667
- WHAT ABOUT THAT GUY?
- THAT'S THE ARMOIRE.

130
00:04:23,767 --> 00:04:26,300
- WHAT'S A--IS THAT
WHERE YOU HANG CLOTHES?

131
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,800
- YEP. YOU CAN HANG CLOTHES
IN THERE.

132
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,067
- OH, COOL.

133
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,400
- ALL RIGHT, SO LET'S
LOOK AT THE CRIBS

134
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,667
THAT WE CAN MATCH
WITH THIS FURNITURE.

135
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:34,867
YOU CAN EITHER DO
THE DOMANI OR ALEX CRIB,

136
00:04:34,967 --> 00:04:36,933
OR WE CAN DO THE JESSICA.

137
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:39,233
- OH, JESSICA.
- WHO'S JESSICA?

138
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,233
- [laughs]

139
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,933
- WHO'S JESSICA?

140
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:47,200
WHY'D YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT?
"JESSICA."

141
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,400
THAT BUGS ME OUT.

142
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,100
IT'S ALL THE HORMONES,
I SAY,

143
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,800
BUT, LIKE, DON'T SAY ANOTHER
GIRL'S NAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

144
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,967
- SO WHEN'S YOUR
ACTUAL DUE DATE?

145
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,367
- THE 10TH.
- OF SEPTEMBER?

146
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:57,800
OH, IT COULD GO
EITHER WAY.

147
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,100
LIKE, SOME OF THE STUFF'S
COMING IN

148
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,567
SORT OF MID-SEPTEMBER.

149
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,067
- WE NEED OUR FURNITURE
BEFORE LORENZO COMES.

150
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,533
IF I GO INTO LABOR
RIGHT NOW

151
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:06,067
AND I DON'T HAVE
THE FURNITURE,

152
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,500
THE BABY'S GONNA PROBABLY
SLEEP ON THE BEAN BAG--

153
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,067
MY LEOPARD-PRINT BEAN BAG,

154
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:11,800
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT'S SAFE.

155
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,833
SO, THE FURNITURE
NEEDS TO GET HERE.

156
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:15,233
- BYE.
- BYE.

157
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,067
- OH.

158
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,133
[upbeat music]

159
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:24,100
*

160
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,767
- I WORK.
I HAVE A FULL-TIME JOB.

161
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,067
SO EVERY DAY IS--
IS BASICALLY

162
00:05:28,167 --> 00:05:30,600
GETTING UP AT, LIKE,
5:00 IN THE MORNING FOR ME.

163
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,767
- I DON'T HAVE A 9:00 TO 5:00
LIKE ROGER,

164
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:38,133
SO THEREFORE, I DON'T HAVE
TO, LIKE, HAVE A SET SCHEDULE.

165
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:39,200
I JUST KIND OF GO
WITH THE FLOW.

166
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,833
GOOD MORNING, GUYS.
HOW'S YOUR DAY?

167
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:43,833
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT JENNI DOES
DURING THE DAY.

168
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:45,233
SHE TELLS ME WHAT SHE DOES.

169
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,733
- ALL RIGHT, SHOWER TIME.

170
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,767
- SHE'LL TELL ME
SHE CLEANED,

171
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,633
SHE TOOK THE DOGS
FOR A WALK.

172
00:05:50,733 --> 00:05:52,700
- WHO PEED?
WHO DID THAT?

173
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,533
- SHE GOT HER HAIR DONE.
SHE MAYBE DID HER NAILS.

174
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,133
AND SHE WENT SHOPPING.

175
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:59,067
- [yawns]

176
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,367
- I FEEL LIKE I COULD DO THAT
IN, LIKE, THREE HOURS.

177
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:05,433
[whimsical music]

178
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,867

179
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,233
[knife tapping]

180
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,500
- I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE I'M
A HOUSEWIFE WITHOUT THE RING.

181
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,333
- LOOKS LIKE DADDY'S BOWL
OF LOVEKINS RIGHT THERE.

182
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:20,067
- AND HE KNOWS I WOULD REALLY,
REALLY LIKE AN ENGAGEMENT RING,

183
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,567
BUT THERE ARE THINGS
THAT I HAVE TO WORK ON

184
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,067
TO GET THAT RING.

185
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,133
- [laughs]

186
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:25,900
I NEED TO LEARN HOW TO COOK.
- WHO?

187
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:26,900
- ME.
- WHY?

188
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,067
- I DON'T KNOW.

189
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,067
I NEED A SIGNATURE DISH,
YOU KNOW,

190
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,467
IN CASE WE EVER BREAK UP.

191
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:33,533
I NEED TO TREAT A LADY
SPECIAL.

192
00:06:33,633 --> 00:06:35,067
I'M KIDDING.

193
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,367
I'M KIDDING.
I'M KIDDING. I'M KIDDING.

194
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:38,933
- JUST GOT TO TEACH
THE OLD DOG NEW TRICKS.

195
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:42,067
IT TAKES A WHILE.
- OKAY.

196
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,067
IT TAKES A WHILE
TO GET A BIG RING TOO.

197
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:47,633
- OH.
- [laughs]

198
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:49,467
CHEERS TO YOU FARTING LATER
'CAUSE YOU'RE EATING THIS.

199
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:50,800
- I KNOW.

200
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,967
- "OH, I JUST GOT TO CHECK
MY FACE REAL QUICK

201
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:56,500
IN THE BATHROOM."
[imitates flatulence]

202
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,067
- * I CAN'T HELP
BUT BREAK IT DOWN *

203
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,300
* I'VE GOT A HEART THAT'S FULL
OF MUSHROOM CLOUDS *

204
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,067
* WHEN I SELF-DESTRUCT

205
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,067
- HI.
- HOW ARE YOU?

206
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,533
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

207
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,767
- THIS MORNING
I GOT LUMINEERS ON MY TEETH,

208
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:11,067
BECAUSE WHEN LORENZO SEES ME
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

209
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,567
I WANT HIM TO BE LIKE,
"HOLY [bleep].

210
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,500
MY MOM IS [bleep] AWESOME."

211
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,967
I THINK HE FEELS
MY ANXIETY.

212
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:19,133
- I'M JUST GONNA POLISH
IN BETWEEN THE TEETH.

213
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:20,933
[tool whirring]

214
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,633
- IF I'M DEFINITELY
GONNA BE A MILF,

215
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,767
I NEED TO DRESS THE PART.

216
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:25,167
EVEN WHEN YOU ARE
GIVING BIRTH,

217
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,300
YOU HAVE TO LOOK HOT.

218
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,300
[tool whirring]

219
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,133
THAT HURT.

220
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:37,633
WELL, I JUST GOT THEM
PUT ON,

221
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:41,067
SO THEY'RE NOT, LIKE,
100%, BUT...

222
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:46,833
THEY'RE NICE AND WHITE
AND PERFECT.

223
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,233
WELL, THAT WAS SCARY.

224
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:52,067
- * TOLD ME
WHEN I GREW UP *

225
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,433
* I'D BE JUST LIKE
MY MOTHER *

226
00:07:54,533 --> 00:08:02,067
*

227
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,133
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

228
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,067
LOOKING AT NICOLE'S TEETH
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

229
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,367
I WASN'T EXPECTING THESE
HUGE LUMINEERS IN HER MOUTH.

230
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:10,200
SHE DIDN'T REALLY TELL ME
SHE WAS GETTING THEM.

231
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,767
SHE CAME HOME,
AND THERE THEY WERE.

232
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,067
OH!
- [laughs]

233
00:08:16,167 --> 00:08:18,433
- THE FRONT ROW IS JUST
A LITTLE ULTRA BIG.

234
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,967
THEY NEED TO FILE IT DOWN
A LITTLE BIT.

235
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,800
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE GETTING,
LIKE, ONE DONE

236
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,467
AND SEEING IF YOU LIKED IT.

237
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:24,700
- THEY DID
THE WHOLE TOP ROW.

238
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,267
- YOU DID NOT TELL ME
THE WHOLE TOP ROW.

239
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,300
- OKAY.

240
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,500
- LET ME SEE.
- NO.

241
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,633
- NICOLE MIGHT HAVE DEVELOPED
A LITTLE LISP.

242
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,733
- I DON'T HAVE A LISP.

243
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:36,233
- [sucking his teeth]

244
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,500
I SLID THE SHEET.

245
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,500
- "I SLID THE SHEET."

246
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,700
- THE SHEET SLID ME.

247
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,867
- THE SEAT-- [laughs]
"THE SHEET SLID ME."

248
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:43,067
- SLID WAS THE SHEET.

249
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,700
- SLITHER WAS THE SEAT.
[laughs]

250
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,367
- YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE WEARING A RETAINER

251
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,700
AND FAKE TEETH.

252
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,900
- [laughs]

253
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:52,133
- THIS TESTS THE, UH,

254
00:08:52,233 --> 00:08:53,200
AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL
IN YOUR BREAST MILK.

255
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,967
- OOH, I NEED THAT.

256
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,067
I'M HAVING WINE
RIGHT AFTER.

257
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,167
I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT
A DRUNK BABY ON MY HAND.

258
00:08:59,267 --> 00:09:00,700
I'M NOT A HILLBILLY.

259
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,100
YOU LOOK PRETTY.

260
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,433
- NICOLE GOT
THE DEENA JOB DONE.

261
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,700
[whimsical music]
- [laughs]

262
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,700
- I WANT WAFFLE FR--
[laughter]

263
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,067
- YOUR TEETH
GOT IN YOUR WAY.

264
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,633
[laughter]

265
00:09:15,467 --> 00:09:18,433
- * YOU HAD ME FALLING,
FALLING, FALLING FOR YOU *

266
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:22,167
* YOU HAD ME WORKING, WORKING,
WORKING FOR YOU *

267
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:23,833
- MY MOM IS COMING
TO GET ME

268
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:26,467
BECAUSE WE ARE REGISTERING
FOR MY BABY SHOWER.

269
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:28,533
- COME ON.
- AAH!

270
00:09:28,633 --> 00:09:30,733
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT I NEED TO GET

271
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:32,533
WHEN IT COMES
TO, YOU KNOW, REGISTERING,

272
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,067
BECAUSE I NEVER HAD
A KID BEFORE.

273
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,733
SO HOPEFULLY MY MOM, LIKE,
KNOWS WHAT TO DO.

274
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,967
- WHY DON'T WE START
WITH CAR SEATS?

275
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:39,467
- I COULD PROBABLY
FIT IN THESE.

276
00:09:39,567 --> 00:09:40,933
NIPPLE SHIELDS?
- YEP.

277
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:42,233
- WHAT IS THAT?

278
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:43,300
- AFTER A WHILE,
IT WILL HURT.

279
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,567
THERE'S NIPPLE CREAMS
AS WELL.

280
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,333
- OH.
[scanner beeps]

281
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,067
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO SCAN THIS
MULTIPLE TIMES.

282
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,700
[scanner beeps]
- OH, I LIKE IT.

283
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,533
[scanner beeps]
- HE DOESN'T SUFFOCATE IN THERE?

284
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,800
- NO. THEY'RE SAFE.
[scanner beeps]

285
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,400
- THIS IS GOOD.

286
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,433
[scanner beeps]
THEY'LL GET THE IDEA.

287
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,433
REGISTERING
IS NOT AS MUCH FUN,

288
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,833
LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

289
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:03,733
I MEAN, PICKING OUT
BREAST PUMPS

290
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,267
AND A SAFETY KIT AND OINTMENTS
AND [bleep] FOR THE ASS.

291
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:10,167
TOOTHBRUSH?
- NOT ANYTIME SOON.

292
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:12,200
- OH, YEAH.
HE HAS NO TEETH.

293
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,800
I NEVER REALLY KNEW HOW MUCH
[bleep] YOU REALLY NEEDED,

294
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,567
YOU KNOW, TO HAVE A BABY.

295
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:18,033
- THIS TESTS
THE AMOUNT OF ALCOHOL

296
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,167
IN YOUR BREAST MILK.

297
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:20,700
- OOH, I NEED THAT.

298
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,767
LORENZO'S DEFINITELY GETTING
VIRGIN BREAST MILK

299
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:24,900
BECAUSE HE CANNOT DRINK
UNTIL HE'S 21.

300
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,433
THAT'S MY JOB.

301
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,533
I'M HAVING WINE RIGHT AFTER.
[scanner beeps]

302
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:29,900
- [laughs]

303
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,667
- I DON'T WANT A DRUNK BABY
ON MY HANDS.

304
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,200
I'M NOT A HILLBILLY.

305
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,533
- WE'RE GOOD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

308
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:41,867
- NICOLE?

309
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:45,300
BABE? IT'S 11:30,
AND JENNI'S ON HER WAY.

310
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,300
- WHO CARES?

311
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,833
- WELL, YOU DON'T WANT HER TO
GET HERE AND YOU'RE SLEEPING.

312
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,867
IT'S A BAD IDEA TO CALL NICOLE
BEFORE NOON,

313
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:53,900
ESPECIALLY PREGNANT.

314
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,767
- [groans]

315
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:57,767
LIKE WAKING UP A DRAGON.
- [laughs]

316
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,000
- YOU DON'T DO IT.

317
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,567
*

318
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,500
YOU CHANGED YOUR HAIR.
- YEAH.

319
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,300
- I LIKE IT SO MUCH BETTER.

320
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,067
YOU LOOK PRETTY.

321
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,767
- THE FIRST THING I NOTICE
WHEN I SEE NICOLE IS HER TEETH.

322
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:17,333
SHE GOT THE DEENA JOB DONE.

323

[laughs]

324
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:19,533
- YES.

325
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:22,067
WAFFLE FRIES.

326
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:23,367
[mumbles]
I WANT WAFFLE FR--

327
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:24,633
[laughter]

328
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:25,633
- HEADS UP.

329
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:26,667
[laughter]

330
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:27,900
YOUR TEETH
GOT IN YOUR WAY.

331
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:29,667
[laughter]

332
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:30,900
SHE'S GONNA THROW UP.
- SHE'S GONNA VOMIT.

333
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:32,233
SHE'S GONNA VOMIT.
- SHE'S GONNA THROW UP.

334
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:36,367
- I ALMOST SPIT UP
THE [bleep]...

335
00:11:36,467 --> 00:11:39,067
NICOLE'S GONNA HAVE TO GET
USED TO HER NEW TEETH.

336
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,467
IT'S LIKE MY BOOBS
BEFORE THEY SETTLED--

337
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:42,900
JUST OUT THERE.

338
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:45,833
- HOW ARE YOU AND ROGER?
- GOOD.

339
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:48,367
- NO RING?

340
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,833
- I THINK I WOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU.

341
00:11:50,933 --> 00:11:54,433
- I THINK HE'LL ASK YOU.

YOU KNOW, HE'S OLD.

344
00:11:59,267 --> 00:12:01,933
I'VE BEEN READY FOR ROGER
TO POP THE QUESTION TO JENNI

345
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,167
FOR, LIKE, TWO YEARS NOW,

346
00:12:03,267 --> 00:12:04,400
AND THE FACT THAT HE'S,
LIKE, [bleep] OLD,

SHOPPING THERE.

IT'S EXACTLY WHAT EVERYONE'S
DRESSING UP IN--

LIKE, FANCY CLOTHES.

363
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,700

THE DRESS TO KARMA,

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,867
YOU SHOULD NOT BE WEARING
THE DRESS TO THE BABY SHOWER.

ANYTHING YOU WANT.

511
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,200
[laughs]
- OW.

512
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,800
- I HAVE JOEY AND YANICE
COMING,

513
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,867
BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA BE GOING
TO THE BABY SHOWER WITH ME

514
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,333
IN THE MORNING.

515
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,333
- YOU KNOW SOMEBODY
WHO'S FIGHTING TONIGHT?

516
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:45,800
WHAT'S HIS NAME?
- FRANKIE EDGAR.

517
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,067
- YOU MET THEM.
- YEAH, YOU MET THEM.

518
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,267
- OH, GET OUT OF HERE.

519
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,167
- IS THERE A LOT OF
PEOPLE COMING, JENNI?

520
00:17:50,267 --> 00:17:51,433
- NOT REALLY.

521
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:52,700
- I CAN ONLY HAVE
DIE-HARD FRANKIE FANS.

522
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
IF YOU'RE NOT A DIE-HARD FAN

523
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,067
AND YOU DON'T REALLY
CARE ABOUT IT--

524
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:57,467
LIKE YANICE--
THEN YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

525
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,200
- YEAH, HE INSTIGATES.
- OFF!

526
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,333
- HE INSTIGATES.
- DON'T!

527
00:18:00,433 --> 00:18:02,167
[Jenni shouts]

528
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:04,300
- GET HIM OFF.

529
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
OH, MY GOD.

530
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,667
- ROGER.
- OH, MY GOD.

531
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,933
[laughter]

532
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:12,867
HOLY [bleep].
HORN DOG.

533
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,567
[whimsical music]

534
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:18,267
- OOH, LET'S GET READY...
- OH, GOD.

535
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:19,933
- [laughs]

536
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:21,433
ME AND JIONNI
ARE THROWING A PARTY

537
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,600
FOR OURSELVES TONIGHT,

538
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,533
BECAUSE OUR FRIEND FRANKIE
IS FIGHTING.

539
00:18:24,633 --> 00:18:28,167
- WE GOT CHIPS, DOUGHNUTS,
DRINKS, GATORADE, DIP.

540
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:29,867
- TWISTEDS.
- TWISTEDS.

541
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:31,467
ALLS WE NEED IS THE PEOPLE.

542
00:18:31,567 --> 00:18:33,067
- THESE ARE OUR GUESTS--

543
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,233
HORTON AND TEDDY.

544
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,800
- I DIDN'T WANT TO BRING
REAL FRIENDS,

545
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,800
'CAUSE SHE'S PREGNANT--
I WANTED TO SHOW RESPECT.

546
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,967
- AND I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY
TOMORROW FOR MY BABY SHOWER.

547
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:42,133
- EXACTLY.

548
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,433
- SO WE COULDN'T
HAVE A REAL PARTY.

549
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,633
- WE THROW ONE SICK PARTY,
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

550
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:47,467
- [laughs]

551
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:50,300
- DUDE, I CAN'T WAIT
FOR THIS [bleep] FIGHT, MAN.

552
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,300
- YO!
HERE'S THE SHOTS.

553
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,067
- FRANKIE'S THE LAST FIGHT ON,
WHICH IS USUALLY THE MAIN EVENT,

554
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,867
SO THERE'S A LOT OF PRE-GAMING
UP TO THAT POINT.

555
00:18:56,967 --> 00:18:58,067
- SHOT.

556
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,200
FOOD, FRIENDS, AND ALCOHOL.
- FOOD...

557
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,567
IT'S WHAT WE LIKE TO DO,

558
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:04,300
ESPECIALLY WHEN FRANKIE'S
FIGHTING, YOU KNOW?

559
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,667
- IS IT BAD

560
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,633
OF THE GRANDMOTHER NOT SHOWING
UP FOR THE BABY SHOWER?

561
00:19:07,733 --> 00:19:09,133
- YOU'RE GOING TOMORROW.
- I KNOW.

562
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,267
- YOU'RE GOOD.
- DID IT START YET? NO.

563
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:12,867
- IT MUST BE ABOUT TIME
TO SWITCH OVER.

564
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:14,900
- WHOO!

565
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,567
- ME AND LAURA SLAVED
OVER THESE [bleep] DIPS.

566
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:18,867
- SO YOU GUYS BETTER
EAT THEM.

567
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:21,800
- SO YOU BETTER
[bleep] EAT THEM.

568
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,700
- ORDER THAT [bleep].

569
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,400
YO, WHAT--WHAT IS THIS [bleep]?
YO, WHAT IS THIS [bleep]?

570
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,233
"ORDER BY PHONE ONLY."

571
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:33,367
- RIGHT AS THE FIGHTS
ARE ABOUT TO START,

572
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:34,800
PAY-PER-VIEW SHUTS OFF.

573
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:38,733
- YO, SOMEBODY BETTER [bleep]
FIGURE THIS OUT RIGHT NOW.

574
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:43,067
- WE ORDERED IT, AND NOTHING'S
[bleep] WORKING.

575
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,467
- JESUS. COME ON, MAN.
SOMEONE [bleep] DO SOMETHING.

576
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:48,067
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS REMATCH FOR SIX MONTHS.

577
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:49,867
I WOULD KILL KITTENS
TO SEE THIS FIGHT.

578
00:19:49,967 --> 00:19:52,067
- NO.
- YES.

579
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,167
- BABIES.
- AND BABIES.

580
00:19:54,267 --> 00:19:55,300
- NOT KITTENS.

581
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,367
- YO, WE GOTTA--WE GOTTA--
WE GOTTA GO.

582
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:59,100
WE HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE WHERE
THIS FIGHT IS GONNA BE ON

583
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,100
AND IS GONNA WORK.

584
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,567
I'M NOT MISSING THIS FIGHT.

585
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:04,433
- I DON'T WANT TO TRANSFER.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

586
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:07,100
I AM FREAKING OUT. THE FIGHTS
HAVE ALREADY STARTED.

587
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,500
- ALL RIGHT.
SO STOP FREAKING OUT.

588
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,200
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND HERE.

589
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,233
- RELAX.

590
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,400
- SHUT THE [bleep] UP,
THEN.

591
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,433
- DON'T TELL ME TO
SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

592
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:15,467
- SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

593
00:20:15,567 --> 00:20:16,833
- BIG MOUTH, LITTLE PEOPLE.

594
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:19,033
- BIG MOUTH,
BIG [bleep] PEOPLE.

595
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,133
- STOP!

596
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:21,100
- ALL OF A SUDDEN,
OUT OF NOWHERE...

597
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,433
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

598
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:23,833
I'LL BE BACK
IN A LITTLE BIT.

599
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:25,367
MY BODY'S
STARTING TO SHUT DOWN.

600
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:27,067
I'M GETTING SICK.
I'M NUMB.

601
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,600
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE HECK'S GOING ON.

602
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:37,233
- HEY, ORDER THAT [bleep].

603
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,000
YO, WHAT--
WHAT IS THIS [bleep]?

604
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,767
YO, WHAT IS THIS [bleep]?
"ORDER BY PHONE ONLY."

605
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,367
YO, WE GOTTA--
WE GOTTA GO.

606
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:44,933
WE HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE WHERE
THIS FIGHT IS GONNA BE ON

607
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:46,333
AND IS GONNA WORK.

608
00:20:46,433 --> 00:20:49,167
- WHAT ABOUT ALL THE FOOD?
EVERYBODY, BRING A PLATTER.

609
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,000
- WE NEED IT ON
WITHIN 30 SECONDS,

610
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,367
BEFORE I LITERALLY THROW THE BOX
OUTSIDE THE [bleep] WINDOW.

611
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:55,667
- JENNI, JUST HANG UP
ON THE GUY.

612
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,033
WE HAVE TO GO.

613
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:58,667
- WE'RE BASICALLY GONNA JUST TRY
AND FIND ANYWHERE

614
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,467
TO WATCH THIS FIGHT,
SO WE'RE LEAVING.

615
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:04,133
WE'RE GONNA FIND A PLACE.

616
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,367
- I'M NOT MISSING IT.

617
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:06,800
NO MATTER WHAT,
I'M NOT MISSING THIS FIGHT.

618
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
[playful music]

619
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,767
- OH, YOU GOT THE DIP.
SHE'S GOT THE DIP!

620
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:13,067
- I GOT ALL YOUR DIPS.
[laughs]

621
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,067
- IT [bleep] TOOK ME FOREVER
TO MAKE THIS.

622
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:16,267
- YOU NEED THE DIP
FOR THE FIGHT.

623
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:17,233
WHAT'S A FIGHT GONNA BE
WITHOUT DIP?

624
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:18,300
- I WAS DYING.

625
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,333
*

626
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:22,733
- GET IN. JOEY!
- I'M COMING IN.

627
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,833
- COME ON, LET'S GO.
- JOEY'S BACK THERE.

628
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:27,133
- YO, GUYS, GUYS, IT'S ON.
COME ON, IT'S ON, IT'S ON.

629
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:29,333
COME ON.
- IT'S BACK ON!

630
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:33,533
- SO NOW WE ALL GO
RUNNING BACK IN THE HOUSE.

631
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:34,600
- OH!
- OH!

632
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,167
[laughter]

633
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:40,633
- MAN DOWN!
HEARD THAT!

634
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,100
- I DID NOT CLEAR THE COUCH.

635
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,733
I THINK I GOT ONE FOOT OVER
AND THE OTHER ONE CAUGHT ON IT,

636
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,767
AND IT WAS JUST--
IT LOOKED LIKE A YARD SALE

637
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:48,533
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR.

638
00:21:48,633 --> 00:21:51,067
- WHAT HAPPENED?
WHO WENT DOWN?

639
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:52,500
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
STEAL MY SEAT.

640
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,300
- OH, MAN.
- I JUST WANNA WATCH THE FIGHT.

641
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,633
- HE JUST TUMBLED
EVERYWHERE.

642
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:56,667
- IT WAS NOT A PRETTY SCENE.

643
00:21:56,767 --> 00:22:03,333
- IT'S FIGHT TIME!

644
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:04,833
- CHEERS TO TONIGHT.

645
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:06,800
- YAY!

646
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,800
- FIGHTING
OUT OF TOMS RIVER, NEW JERSEY,

647
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:14,433
FRANKIE "THE ANSWER" EDGAR!

648
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,067
- LET'S GO, FRANKIE!

649
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:19,100
LET'S GO, FRANKIE!
- WHOO!

650
00:22:21,433 --> 00:22:23,500
- FRANKIE!

651
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,400
- MAYBE ROGER AND JENNI'S PARTY
IS BETTER THAN OURS.

652
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,600
- THEY'RE NOT HAVING A BABY.

653
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,333
WHOO!

654
00:22:37,433 --> 00:22:39,667
- YEAH!
- OH!

655
00:22:39,767 --> 00:22:41,167
- HE CAUGHT THAT ONE. OH!

656
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:43,233
- OH! OH!

657
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:46,400
[cheering]

658
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,967
I AM SO INTO THIS.

659
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,500
THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NOBODY
ELSE IN THE ROOM.

660
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,367
I DIDN'T CARE.
I'M--I'M INTO THIS FIGHT.

661
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:52,800
YOU KNOW HOW I GET, BABE.

662
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:54,400
- IT'S TRUE,
'CAUSE I GET THE SAME WAY.

663
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,600
- MM-HMM.

664
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,733
- THERE'S THE UPPERCUT.
- OH, HE HURT HIM!

665
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:01,600
- YEAH, BUDDY.
- COME ON, COME ON!

666
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,200
COME ON! FRANKIE!

667
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:07,133
[overlapping shouting]

668
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:08,867
- IT'S SO BACK AND FORTH.

669
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:11,300
THE ACTION
IS SO KIND OF EVENLY PACED

670
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
FOR THE MOST PART OF IT.

671
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,700
- IT WAS DRIVING ME NUTS.
- YEAH.

672
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,267
AND THE ANXIETY
IS JUST BUILDING.

673
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:17,067
LAST ROUND, MAN,
COME ON.

674
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:18,067
- GO!
- COME ON!

675
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:19,067
- OH!
- OH!

676
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:22,967
[overlapping shouting]

677
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,067
- DON'T LET HIM UP!
- DO NOT GET UP!

678
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:26,333
- DON'T LET HIM UP!

679
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:28,533
- COME ON, FRANKIE,
COME ON!

680
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:29,800
[overlapping shouting]

681
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,800
- UNDER 90 SECONDS
ON THE CLOCK HERE.

682
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,300
[cheering]

683
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,600
- COME ON,
TAKE HIM DOWN!

684
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,633
- KNOCK HIM OUT.

685
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:39,300
- MAN, THAT IS
A CLOSE FIGHT.

686
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,067
- I'M GONNA HAVE
A [bleep] ANEURYSM.

687
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,167
- THE WINNER,
BY SPLIT DECISION...

688
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:48,767
HENDERSON!

689
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:50,333
- NO!
- WHAT?

690
00:23:50,433 --> 00:23:52,533
- OH, MY GOD!

691
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,133
- AW!

692
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,067
- I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW WHO WAS
JUDGING THAT FIGHT THAT NIGHT,

693
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:58,800
'CAUSE CLEARLY,
THEY WERE BLIND.

694
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,667
I'M DONE, MAN.
I JUST WANT TO GO TO BED NOW.

695
00:24:01,767 --> 00:24:04,100
- THE PARTY JUST GOES
A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

696
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,900
- HE'S WEARING
A "GIRLS SUCK" SHIRT.

697
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:09,867
YOU COOL WITH THAT, ROGER?
- GIRLS DO SUCK.

698
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:12,433
- GIRLS, WE SUCK?
- YEAH. SO SHUT UP.

699
00:24:12,533 --> 00:24:13,500
- WE SUCK?
- YEAH, YOU SUCK.

700
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,867
- ROGER, YOU USED TO BE
A LOT NICER.

701
00:24:15,967 --> 00:24:18,167
- OOH.
- I USED TO BE A LOT NICER?

702
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:19,600
- YOU USED TO BE.

703
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,967
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU,
YOU WERE.

704
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:23,933
- I USED TO BE A LOT NICER?
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

705
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,567
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

706
00:24:25,667 --> 00:24:28,200
- I'M CLEANING UP THE KITCHEN,
AND LEGIT, ALL OF A SUDDEN,

707
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,700
YANICE AND ROGER
START GOING AT IT

708
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,733
IN A NON-JOKING WAY.

709
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:33,367
LIKE, THEY'RE SERIOUS.

710
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:35,233
- I'VE REALLY GOT AN ACTIVE
INVOLVEMENT WITH PETA,

711
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:37,067
AND YOU KILLED SO MANY BIRDS
TO MAKE THOSE EARRINGS,

712
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,667
I CAN'T SEE YOU
IN THE SAME LIGHT.

713
00:24:38,767 --> 00:24:42,133
- WHO'S PETA?
[laughter]

714
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:43,933
- WHO'S PETA? YOU ONLY MET
ONE OF MY BOYFRIENDS.

715
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,733
- PETA-PETA-PO-PETA.
- PETA.

716
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:49,567
PETA, PETA,
BIG [bleep] PUMPKIN EATER.

717
00:24:49,667 --> 00:24:51,067
- OH, MY GOD.
- YEAH.

718
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,433
- YANICE, SHUT UP.

719
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:58,900
- IT WAS A JOKE.
RELAX. RELAX. RELAX.

720
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:00,200
- SHUT THE [bleep] UP, THEN.

721
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,233
- DON'T TELL ME
TO SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

722
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,900
- SHUT THE [bleep] UP, THEN.

723
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:05,500
- YANICE-AH.
[laughter]

724
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,067
- STOP PISSIN' ME OFF,
OR I'LL--

725
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,267
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- [laughs]

726
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:10,100
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
BITE MY ANKLE?

727
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,700
- YOU'RE [bleep] OBNOXIOUS.
- DON'T PISS ME OFF, SERIOUSLY.

728
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,333
- DON'T PISS ME
THE [bleep] OFF.

729
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,067
- YOU WILL LOSE,
I ASSURE YOU.

730
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,233
- OH, I WILL LOSE?
DON'T [bleep] PISS ME OFF.

731
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,467
- YOU WILL LOSE.

732
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:21,967
I THINK SHE DRINKS
A LITTLE TOO MUCH, AND...

733
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:23,300
- YEAH.

734
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,133
- SHE DOESN'T HAVE
A VERY GOOD PERCEPTION

735
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,367
OF WHAT'S GOING ON
AROUND HER.

736
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:29,367
- SHUT UP, ROGER.
- ME?

737
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:31,433
- HE'S [bleep] OBNOXIOUS.
- ME?

738
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:32,900
- I FEEL LIKE ROGER'S,
YOU KNOW,

739
00:25:33,067 --> 00:25:34,900
AGGRESSION RIGHT NOW
IS COMING FROM FRANKIE'S FIGHT.

740
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:37,700
- BIG MOUTH, LITTLE PEOPLE.
- [laughs]

741
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,233
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

742
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:41,467
BIG MOUTH,
BIG [bleep] PEOPLE.

743
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:42,733
HOW ABOUT THAT?

744
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:44,433
- I HAVE MY GIRLFRIEND
OF, LIKE, TEN YEARS.

745
00:25:44,533 --> 00:25:46,200
I HAVE MY BOYFRIEND
OF TWO YEARS.

746
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,600
SO BOTH PARTIES JUST NEED
TO SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

747
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,967
- YOU'RE [bleep] OBNOXIOUS.
- SHUT UP!

748
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:53,467
- ...BY HIS [bleep] ARROGANT.
- BOTH OF YOU.

749
00:25:53,567 --> 00:25:55,567
- THERE'S A BIG SHIELD
OF ARROGANCE ALL ABOVE YOU.

750
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:58,633
- BOTH OF YOU.
- OKAY.

751
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:00,567
- YEP.
[laughter]

752
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:01,733
- I GOTTA GO.

753
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:04,433
- I'M NOT APOLOGIZING.

754
00:26:04,533 --> 00:26:06,267
- [sighs]

755
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,467
- [bleep].

756
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,733
- WHERE'D HE GO?
- WHO [bleep] CARES?

757
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:12,367
- OH!
- YANICE-SA.

758
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,067
- YOU BREAST-FEED,
YOU STILL CAN'T DRINK.

759
00:26:14,133 --> 00:26:15,200
- YEAH, PUMP AND DUMP.

760
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,133
I DESERVE
A FEW GLASSES OF WINE

761
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:19,100
AFTER CARRYING
THIS BIG WATERMELON AROUND--

762
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,600
MAYBE EVEN A COUPLE BOTTLES.

763
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,667
- ALL I CARE ABOUT IS THIS BABY
SHOWER GOING RIGHT FOR NICOLE,

764
00:26:23,767 --> 00:26:25,267
AND ME BEING SICK
RIGHT NOW

765
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,533
IS, BY FAR, THE WORST THING
THAT COULD HAPPEN.

766
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:32,100
- * DARK IS THE NIGHT

767
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,067
* AS IT FALLS

768
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:36,733
* ON THESE SHADOWED FACES

769
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:40,400
- [groans] THIS PLACE SMELLS
LIKE BEER AND SHAME.

770
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,767
LAST NIGHT THERE WAS
A BIG ARGUMENT

771
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,067
BETWEEN ROGER AND YANICE,

772
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,800
AND ROGER DIDN'T COME HOME
LAST NIGHT,

773
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,867
AND I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM
THIS MORNING,

774
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:48,433
AND I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BABY SHOWER.

775
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:50,267
[knocks on door]

776
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:52,067
GOOD MORNING.
- HI.

777
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,933
- GOOD MORNING.
- HOW DO YOU GUYS FEEL?

778
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:55,533
- LIKE [bleep].

779
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:57,433
- BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT IS WHAT IT IS,

780
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:59,733
AND AS LONG AS
HE'S NOT MAD AT ME,

781
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:01,400
I'LL BE FINE WITH IT.

782
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,233
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT?

783
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,400
- THIS WASN'T 100% MY FAULT.

784
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,433
- HE WAS MAKING JOKES
YOU DIDN'T GET.

785
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,633
YOU GOT REALLY ANGRY
AND NASTY.

786
00:27:09,733 --> 00:27:11,233
YOU WENT ON ATTACK MODE.

787
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:13,767
- FIRST OF ALL,
HE WAS DISRESPECTING ME.

788
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:16,067
IT WASN'T A JOKE.

789
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,833
- YOU DIDN'T GET A JOKE
HE REFERENCED,

790
00:27:17,933 --> 00:27:19,633
AND YOU GOT NASTY
WITH HIM, DUDE.

791
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:22,433
- NO, HE--HE WAS BEING
VERY DISRESPECTFUL TO ME

792
00:27:22,533 --> 00:27:24,133
THE ENTIRE [bleep] TIME.

793
00:27:24,233 --> 00:27:26,400
- NO, HE WASN'T.
YOU WERE BELLIGERENT, DUDE.

794
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,700
YANICE IS TRYING TO SAY
THAT ROGER WAS RUDE LAST NIGHT,

795
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,133
AND I'M DEFENDING MY MAN.

796
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:31,200
SHE WAS RUDE.

797
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,567
- NOW YOU'RE TAKING
HIS SIDE,

798
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:35,067
AND IT'S LIKE, I'M YOUR
[bleep] BEST FRIEND, AND--

799
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:36,400
- YEAH, BUT HE'S MY MAN.

800
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,133
- LISTEN, I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND,

801
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:39,567
BECAUSE HE IS
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

802
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,400
BUT I AM YOUR BEST FRIEND ALSO.

803
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,233
- YEAH. THAT'S WHY
I WAS LIKE--

804
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,500
- AND HE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND
THAT, LIKE--

805
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,300
HAVE SOME RESPECT
FOR ME TOO.

806
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,300
- EVERYONE HAS A FRIEND THAT,
YOU KNOW, IS OVERDRAMATIC

807
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,767
AND, YOU KNOW, DRAMA,
AND THAT'S MY YANICE.

808
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:53,867
- YOU GOTTA ADMIT,
BOTH OF YOU TOOK IT OVERBOARD.

809
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:57,600
- MAYBE, 'CAUSE WE
WERE [bleep] DRINKING.

810
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,133
NOW I FEEL [bleep] BAD,

811
00:27:59,233 --> 00:28:03,167
AND NOW I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE
TO ROGER AGAIN.

812
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,467
I HATE TALKING TO ROGER.

813
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:06,200
I FEEL LIKE HE'S MY FATHER.

814
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,567
- [laughs]
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

815
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:12,367
- * WE CAN MAKE IT
ALL NIGHT *

816
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:14,633
* EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT

817
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:18,767
* ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT *

818
00:28:18,867 --> 00:28:21,700
- SO, WAKING UP THIS MORNING,
MY STOMACH FEELS WEIRD,

819
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,333
AND I FEEL LIKE
I'M HAVING CONTRACTIONS,

820
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:24,600
AND I'M SCARED
I'M GONNA HAVE THIS BABY.

821
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,567
- HOW WE DOING, PAL?
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

822
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,267
WHAT UP, G?
- WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

823
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:30,600
- THIS DAY COULDN'T HAVE
WORKED OUT ANY BETTER.

824
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,267
NICOLE'S SHOWER
IS AT A COUNTRY CLUB.

825
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:34,067
I GET TO PLAY GOLF
WITH MY BROTHER

826
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:35,367
AND EIGHT OF OUR FRIENDS.

827
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:37,700
NICOLE, YOU REMEMBER
GEOFF AND JOHN, RIGHT?

828
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,500
- HI, NICOLE.
ARE YOU READY? BIG DAY.

829
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,900
- I HAVE TO SHOWER.

830
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:43,600
- A GUY'S RESPONSIBILITY
AT A BABY SHOWER

831
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,067
IS TO COME AT THE END,
HELP WITH THE PRESENTS.

832
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:48,600
LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU.

833
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
- SEE YOU OVER THERE?

834
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,433
NICOLE INVITED
OVER 100 PEOPLE.

835
00:28:51,533 --> 00:28:53,600
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SEE HOW
MANY GIFTS I HAVE TO BRING HOME.

836
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,700
- NIC?
- YEAH?

837
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,400
- HOW WE DOING?
- JUST PUTTING JEWELRY ON.

838
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,967
- OH, OKAY.

839
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:03,367
- I REALLY DON'T CARE IF
MY WATER BREAKS AT THE SHOWER,

840
00:29:03,467 --> 00:29:04,767
BECAUSE THAT
WOULD BE AWESOME.

841
00:29:04,867 --> 00:29:08,100
I COULD HAVE ALL THESE PRESENTS,
AND I WOULD BE GIVING BIRTH.

842
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,500
BUT I'M JUST NERVOUS FOR, LIKE,
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TODAY.

843
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,700
- [groans]

844
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,433
- I THINK I'VE GONNA
GIVE LABOR TODAY.

845
00:29:13,533 --> 00:29:15,467
- OH, MY GOD.
- I'M NOT KIDDING.

846
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:17,067
[upbeat music]

847
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:18,433
I NEED A GLASS OF WINE.

848
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:20,567
I'M DYING.

849
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:23,300
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU GOT THREE MORE WEEKS.

850
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,333
- YEAH.
- AND THAT'S IT.

851
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:27,067
- IF YOU BREAST-FEED,
YOU STILL CAN'T DRINK.

852
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:28,167
- BUT I NEED, LIKE,
PROTEIN.

853
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,200
YOU CAN DRINK.
- NO, YOU CANNOT.

854
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,233
- YOU CAN DUMP.

855
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,600
- DUMP?
- YEAH, PUMP AND DUMP.

856
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,567
I DEFINITELY THINK I DESERVE
A FEW GLASSES OF WINE

857
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:38,533
AFTER CARRYING
THIS BIG WATERMELON AROUND--

858
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:40,400
MAYBE EVEN A COUPLE BOTTLES.

859
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,767
- PUMP AND DUMP WHAT?

860
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:45,300
- IF YOU DRINK, THEN YOU PUMP
YOUR BREAST MILK OUT

861
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,833
AND THEN DUMP IT,

862
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:50,433
AND THEN YOU TEST YOUR MILK
TO SEE IF IT'S ALCOHOL-FREE.

863
00:29:50,533 --> 00:29:52,333
SO, RIGHT AFTER
I GIVE BIRTH,

864
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:53,733
THE BOTTLE OF PINOT GRIGIO--

865
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,367
YEAH, IT'S DEFINITELY
GONNA BE CHILLING

866
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:56,800
AS I'M PUSHING OUT LORENZO.

867
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,700
AND THAT'S OKAY,
BECAUSE A LOT OF MOTHERS DO IT.

868
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,067
- LET'S JUST NOT DRINK.

869
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:05,567
- * VICTORIOUS,
VICTORIOUS *

870
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:08,300
* COUNT IT DOWN NOW,
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 *

871
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,667
- PULL UP RIGHT UP HERE.

872
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:12,400
- VALET? I HATE VALET.
- WHY?

873
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,300
- 'CAUSE I JUST FEEL LIKE
RICH PEOPLE DO THAT.

874
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,700
SO MY SHOWER IS AT
FALKIRK ESTATE AND COUNTRY CLUB,

875
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,467
SO IT'S LIKE A CLASSY JOINT.

876
00:30:20,567 --> 00:30:23,033
THIS IS REALLY PRETTY.
- ISN'T IT PRETTY HERE?

877
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:27,067
- * VICTORIOUS,
VICTORIOUS *

878
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:29,533
* COUNT IT DOWN NOW,
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 *

879
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:31,633
- HI, MOM.
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

880
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:33,100
- I HAVE TO FART
REALLY BAD.

881
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,000
- [laughs]
- YOU CAN DO THAT.

882
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,600
- THIS IS OVERWHELMING.

883
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,100
- JUST GO WITH IT, HONEY.
JUST GO WITH IT.

884
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,733
- IT'S SO CLASSY...
TOO CLASSY.

885
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:46,233
WE NEED SOME ANIMAL PRINT
IN THIS BITCH.

886
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,367
- [laughs]

887
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:50,167
[upbeat music]

888
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:52,000
[overlapping chatter]

889
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,733
- HI, BOO. YOU LOOK--
YOU LOOK SO PRETTY.

890
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:56,433
- YOU TOO.
- HI.

891
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:57,800
- LET ME SEE.

892
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,667
- OH, I LOVE YOU.
LET ME SEE.

893
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:01,700
YOU LOOK SO GOOD.
- I'M HUGE.

894
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,867
- THIS DRESS LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.
- RIGHT?

895
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:07,267
HI, SAM.
YOU LOOK PRETTY.

896
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,667
FEEL MY BELLY BUTTON.

897
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:10,533
- [laughs]

898
00:31:10,633 --> 00:31:12,233
- THAT'S MY MOM, EVELYN.
- HI.

899
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,533
- NICOLE.

900
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:15,333
- HI, BOO.
- HOW ARE YOU?

901
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:18,667
- I THINK EVERY GIRL SHOULD HAVE
A GAY FRIEND NAMED JOEY,

902
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:22,667
BECAUSE EVERY GUY NAMED JOEY
WHO'S GAY IS [bleep] AMAZING.

903
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:24,467
- DO I LOOK LIKE
A JUICEHEAD GUIDO, NICOLE?

904
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:27,733
- YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.

905
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,367
FINALLY!

906
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:31,133
- I'M REALLY EXCITED
FOR NICOLE'S BABY SHOWER,

907
00:31:31,233 --> 00:31:34,767
BUT, UH, I AM
SO BEYOND HUNGOVER.

908
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:37,533
- SO YOU WORE THE BLUE?
- I DID.

909
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:39,500
- WHY ARE YOU
WEARING STOCKINGS?

910
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,967
- 'CAUSE I DIDN'T SHAVE
MY LEGS.

911
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,567
- OH.
- [laughs]

912
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,400
- MY GOD. CAN YOU NOT WEAR
STOCKINGS EVER AGAIN?

913
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,233
- I-I DIDN'T SHOWER
THIS MORNING.

914
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,333
- ARE YOU HUNGOVER?
- A LITTLE BIT.

915
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:51,600
- KEEP DRINKIN'.

916
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,967
I'M DEFINITELY GLAD
THAT JENNI IS HERE WITH ME,

917
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:55,267
YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE I NEED HER,

918
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:57,267
AND I'M SO GLAD THAT ALL
MY BEST FRIENDS ARE HERE.

919
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:58,733
IT FEELS REALLY GOOD.

920
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,567
WANT TO COME GET A DRINK?
- YEAH. WHERE'S YOUR MAN?

921
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:02,567
- HE'S GOLFING.

922
00:32:02,667 --> 00:32:05,633
[upbeat music]

923
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:06,700
*

924
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,867
- * I'LL CALL IT QUITS

925
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,367
* SO JUST CALL ME CRAZY

926
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:11,700
- I'M SWEATING PROFUSELY.

927
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,233
- YOU ARE SWEATING, MAN.
WHAT'S WRONG?

928
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,333
- I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

929
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:15,433
I TOOK MY BROTHER.

930
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,067
I'M WITH MY FRIENDS,
HAVING FUN,

931
00:32:17,167 --> 00:32:19,267
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, OUT
OF NOWHERE, I'M GETTING WEAK.

932
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:21,767
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

933
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:24,400
MY BODY'S STARTING
TO SHUT DOWN. I'M NUMB.

934
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,200
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HECK'S GOING ON.

935
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,400
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

936
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,967
I'LL BE BACK
IN A LITTLE BIT.

937
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:31,900
I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH
A ROUND OF GOLF.

938
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:34,767
I HAVE SOMEBODY DRIVE ME
BACK TO MY CAR.

939
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:36,200
I THOUGHT OF MAYBE JUST
GETTING SOME FRESH AIR.

940
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,233
I'LL SIT IN THE VAN AND JUST
HAVE THE AIR BLASTING,

941
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,800
HOPING THAT, YOU KNOW,
IT GOES BY.

942
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,333
- [laughs]
WE CAN'T STOP!

943
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:47,900
- [screams]

944
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:51,467
- IT LOOKS LIKE A SAFARI.
WHERE ARE ALL THE GUYS?

945
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:54,633
- BABE.
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

946
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:58,967
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- THE HOSPITAL.

947
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:05,833
[overlapping chatter]

948
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,933
- THE SCRATCH-OFFS ARE--I HAVE
A DOOR PRIZE FOR EVERYBODY.

949
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:14,800
WHO WON? YOU WON?
- DID I WIN?

950
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,100
- SEE THE SECURITY GUARD
AT THE FRONT DOOR?

951
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,400
HE'S YOURS.
YOU TAKE HIM HOME.

952
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,767
[laughter]

953
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:21,533
- YOUR MOM IS GOING NUTS
RIGHT NOW.

954
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,500
- WHAT'S SHE DOING?
- SHE'S IN HER GLORY.

955
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,067
[laughter]

956
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,533
- IS HE NICE?

957
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:28,567
- HE WILL BE
WHEN I GET DONE WITH HIM.

958
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,400
[laughter]

959
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,200
- I'M WITH CHRIS' MOM,

960
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,533
AND I'M TALKING
ABOUT ROGER

961
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:35,967
AND HOW JENNI AND ROGER
HADN'T HAD SEX OR WHATEVER,

962
00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:39,700
AND SHE'S LIKE, "WHY?
I LOVE--I LOVE ROGER."

963
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,733
- WELL, I GET EXCITED AS WELL
ABOUT ROGER,

964
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,500
AND I WAS UPSET
HE WASN'T HERE.

965
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,367
I WANTED TO HIT ON HIM AGAIN.

966
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:47,433
I TWEETED HIM A PICTURE OF ME
IN A THONG THE OTHER DAY,

967
00:33:47,533 --> 00:33:49,100
AND HE SAID HE THREW UP
IN HIS MOUTH.

968
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,400
- I FEEL LIKE
HE'S LIKE A MEATBALL.

969
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,800
- THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL ME.

970
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,633
THEY CALL ME, LIKE, A GAY
MEATBALL VERSION OF SNOOKI.

971
00:33:53,733 --> 00:33:55,333
- HE KILLS ME.

972
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,867
- KATIE. OPEN PRESENTS.
- YES!

973
00:34:00,433 --> 00:34:02,333
- HEY, EVERYONE.
OH, MY GOD.

974
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:04,800
[laughter]

975
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,800
I'M OPENING UP PRESENTS
RIGHT NOW.

976
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,800
I REMEMBER THESE WINE GLASSES.
- YEAH.

977
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:14,233
- VERY HOT.
IS THAT A BEAR?

978
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:15,933
- IT'LL FIT NICE DOWNSTAIRS.

979
00:34:16,067 --> 00:34:17,333
- THANKS, JUSTINE.

980
00:34:17,433 --> 00:34:18,900
A CHANGING PAD COVER.

981
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:21,067
- IS THAT A DIAPER BAG
OR JUST A BAG?

982
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,867
- A DIAPER BAG.
THANK YOU!

983
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:26,700
SO THERE'S, LEGIT, LIKE,
A MILLION PRESENTS RIGHT NOW

984
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,933

AND I'M SO EXCITED,

985
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,900
BUT HOLY [bleep],
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESENTS.

986
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:36,200
SAMANTHA. AW!
- OH, MY GOD!

987
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,400
THEY'RE SO CUTE.
[laughter]

988
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,333
- YAY.
[laughs]

989
00:34:41,433 --> 00:34:43,600
- YEAH, SHE'S OPENING
OURS NOW.

990
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,167
- THAT'S CUTE.

991
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:46,500
- I PICKED THOSE ONES.

992
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,867
- VERY CUTE.
- [laughs]

993
00:34:47,967 --> 00:34:49,300
- NOW WHAT?

994
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,767
- I'M GONNA GIVE IT
MY BEST EFFORT,

995
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:52,300
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA BE CHECKING OUT

996
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,067
OF THIS ASSEMBLY LINE
REAL QUICK.

997
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:56,800
- OH, MY GOD,
I LOVE THIS!

998
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,067
[overlapping chatter]

999
00:34:58,133 --> 00:34:59,333
- AM I ALLOWED TO TAKE...
- A SINGING THING?

1000
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:02,200
- A POTTY BREAK?
- OW.

1001
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,467
A SINGING TOY.

1002
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,767
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW NICOLE
IS CONTINUING TO OPEN GIFTS.

1003
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:08,533
LIKE, IT GOT TO A POINT
WHERE I WAS LIKE,

1004
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:10,333
"I CAN'T DO THIS [bleep]
ANYMORE."

1005
00:35:10,433 --> 00:35:11,767
IT WAS PRETTY RIDICULOUS.

1006
00:35:11,867 --> 00:35:13,900
- JIONNI'S APPARENTLY
ON THE GOLF COURSE SOMEWHERE.

1007
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:15,733
MAYBE I SHOULD GO OUT ON A HUNT
AND LOOK FOR HIM.

1008
00:35:15,833 --> 00:35:18,133
I THINK THAT'S HIM
IN THE RED.

1009
00:35:18,233 --> 00:35:19,167
- DO YOU WANT TO STEAL A CART?

1010
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:20,533
- CAN WE?
- HMM.

1011
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:22,667
- [gasps]
THINK WE'LL GET IN TROUBLE?

1012
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:25,400
- MAYBE IF WE, LIKE,
SURPRISE HER WITH JIONNI--

1013
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,467
- IN IT.
- IN IT.

1014
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:28,267
- WE HAVE TO FIND HIM.

1015
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,500
- WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE MOTHER-TO-BE'S FIANCE.

1016
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,233
- FIANCE. DO YOU KNOW
WHERE JIONNI IS?

1017
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:35,167
[dramatic music]

1018
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,500
- I'M SITTING IN MY CAR,

1019
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,300
AND I LITERALLY CAN'T FEEL
ANYTHING IN MY BODY.

1020
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,800
SOMETHING'S WRONG RIGHT NOW,

1021
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,067
AND IT'S A SCARY FEELING
NOT KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON.

1022
00:35:42,167 --> 00:35:45,733
- HERE, I BROUGHT
SOME WATER FOR YOU.

1023
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,833
- HELP ME.
- WHAT?

1024
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:52,267
- I'M TIRED.
I JUST WANNA...

1025
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:53,533
CLOSE MY EYES.

1026
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:55,200
MY AUNT COMES
TO CHECK ON ME,

1027
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,767
AND SHE'S LIKE,
"YOU HAVE A--

1028
00:35:56,867 --> 00:35:58,267
"THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH YOU.

1029
00:35:58,367 --> 00:36:00,567
LET ME GET YOU OUT OF HERE."

1030
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:03,733
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS THIS BABY
SHOWER GOING RIGHT FOR NICOLE,

1031
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,933
AND ME BEING SICK
RIGHT NOW IS, BY FAR,

1032
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:07,967
THE WORST THING
THAT COULD HAPPEN.

1033
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:15,600
- THERE'S MORE
SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW ON THE WAY.

1034
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,933
- AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

1035
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:21,067
[whimsical music]

1036
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,367
*

1037
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:25,300
- I JUST SENT THE JOEYS OUT
ON A GOLF RUN.

1038
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,500
- HEY!
- IS THAT A GIRL?

1039
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,167
- WHAT?
- COME ON, JEN.

1040
00:36:30,267 --> 00:36:31,567
- WHEN IT COMES
TO BABY SHOWERS,

1041
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,200
THEY'RE, LIKE,
OVERWHELMING.

1042
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,500
IT'S TEDIOUS WORK OPENING UP
THAT MANY PRESENTS,

1043
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,700
AND IT GOT A LITTLE BORING,

1044
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,067
SO WE GOT TO MAKE
THE BEST OF IT.

1045
00:36:38,167 --> 00:36:39,633
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO THIS.

1046
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:40,667
YEAH, SHOW YOUR BOOBS
A LITTLE BIT.

1047
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:41,667
SHOW YOUR PECS.
- [laughs]

1048
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,833
- THIS IS WHAT WE DO.

1049
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:47,467
- GAY JOEY!

1050
00:36:47,567 --> 00:36:49,800
- WHERE IS HE?
- WHERE ARE YOU?

1051
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,633
IS HE, LIKE,
DRUNK SOMEWHERE?

1052
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:55,733
- [laughing]
WE CAN'T STOP!

1053
00:36:57,933 --> 00:36:59,467
- [screams]

1054
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:02,800
- IT LOOKS LIKE A SAFARI.
WHERE ARE ALL THE GUYS?

1055
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,067
- THE GOLF-CART TRIP
IS SO MUCH FUN RIGHT NOW.

1056
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,633
I HAVE NOT SEEN JIONNI AT ALL.

1057
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:08,467
BUT WE'RE MAKING IT LIKE
AN AMUSEMENT PARK RIDE.

1058
00:37:08,567 --> 00:37:10,633
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND GAYS
WHEN THERE'S ONLY STRAIGHTS.

1059
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:11,767
IT'S PRETTY FUN.

1060
00:37:11,867 --> 00:37:14,400
- OH, THERE'S SOME BOYS
FOR YOU, JOE.

1061
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,900
- HEY!
- WE WERE LOOKING FOR YOU.

1062
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:18,467
- COME BACK HERE.
- [squeals]

1063
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:19,600
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1064
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,833
- CAN YOU--CAN YOU
REVERSE IT, PLEASE?

1065
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:22,567
- IS THAT
YOUR OWN GOLF CART?

1066
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:24,333
- ME AND JENNI HAVE
A QUESTION FOR YOU.

1067
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:26,200
WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
- TYLER.

1068
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,633
- TYLER, I'M JOEY.
- WHAT'S UP, BRO?

1069
00:37:27,733 --> 00:37:29,067
- DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?
- NOT AT ALL.

1070
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:30,900
- DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?
[laughter]

1071
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:32,133
- I WOULDN'T GO THAT WAY.
- OH.

1072
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:33,600
- AW.
- AW.

1073
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,800
- WE HAVE TO LEAVE.
BYE, TYLER.

1074
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,700
- I'M SORRY.
- THAT'S OKAY.

1075
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,167
YOU CAN'T COME
TO OUR PARTY ANYMORE.

1076
00:37:38,267 --> 00:37:39,867
AND JENNI'S NOT GONNA
SHOW YOU HER [bleep].

1077
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,767
- OH, THAT SUCKS.
- SORRY.

1078
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:44,433
- "PARTY, MY CRIB,
2:00 A.M., BRING A BOTTLE."

1079
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:45,867
[laughter]

1080
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,067
- WELL, THIS WAS LOVELY.

1081
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,667
- THANK YOU, JOE.
- THANK YOU, JOE.

1082
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:53,633
- ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE MY NUMBER.
CALL ME LATER.

1083
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:55,433
- THANK YOU.

1084
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:58,800
- OH, SHE'S OPENING
PRESENTS AGAIN.

1085
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,200
- HI, GUYS.
[laughs]

1086
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,833
I'M OPENING YOUR GIFT.

1087
00:38:02,933 --> 00:38:04,500
THIS IS FROM JWOWW.

1088

[laughter]

1089
00:38:06,733 --> 00:38:09,967
BUT WE CALL HER JENNI,
MY BOO-BOO.

1090
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:12,800
- NO, I JUST SIGNED IT "JWOWW"
TO PISS HER OFF.

1091
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:16,500
- OH, MY GOD!
ALCOHOL TESTING STRIPS!

1092
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,433
[laughter]

1093
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:21,800
OH, I NEED THAT SO BAD.
- [laughs]

1094
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,833
MY GIFT DEFINITELY TOPS
ONE OF NICOLE'S TOP TEN--

1095
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:26,500
ALCOHOL TEST STRIPS
FOR THE BREAST MILK

1096
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,100
TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE'S NOT
GETTING LORENZO DRUNK

1097
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,100
ON OUR NIGHTS OUT.

1098
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,600
- WHERE'S JIONNI?

1099
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,433
I WANT YOU TO OPEN GISELLE'S
GIFT. THAT'S SO CUTE.

1100
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:34,900
- [gasps]
OH, JIONNI REALLY WANTED ONE.

1101
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:36,667
WHERE IS HE?

1102
00:38:36,767 --> 00:38:39,733
SO JIONNI WAS SUPPOSED TO MAKE
IT TO THE SHOWER, BUT HE DIDN'T,

1103
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,867
AND RIGHT NOW I'M JUST WONDERING
IF HE'S HAVING FUN PLAYING GOLF,

1104
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:43,867
OR WHAT IS HE DOING?

1105
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:45,067
WHERE IS HE?

1106
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,067
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I MISS HIM.

1107
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,500
SO THANK YOU GUYS
FOR COMING OUT.

1108
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,867
I HOPE YOU GUYS
HAD A GOOD TIME.

1109
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:50,800
- DON'T HOG THE MIC.
- OH. MY MOM TOO.

1110
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,267

EVERYONE.

00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:54,200
IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE
TO SEE EVERYBODY HERE.

1112
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,167

I LOVE YOU.
- BYE. I LOVE YOU.

1114
00:38:58,867 --> 00:39:00,433
- BUT I STILL HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM JIONNI,

1115
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:02,900
AND I'M WONDERING WHERE HE IS
AND WHAT HE'S DOING.

1116
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:04,900
I WISH JIONNI WAS HERE.

1117
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:06,133
SO I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE

1118
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:07,500
AND FIGURE OUT, LIKE,
WHAT'S GOING ON.

1119
