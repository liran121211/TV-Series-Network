00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:56,456
I REALIZE KINDA WHAT A MILESTONE
THAT IS IN OUR RELATIONSHIP

370
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,906
BECAUSE IT JUST KINDA

'CAUSE I'VE HEARD SO MANY
PHONE CALLS WITH YOU TWO, BUT--

- SHE WAS--
YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON

378
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,546
SHE SAID SHE GOT NERVOUS
MEETING.

379
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,996
- THAT'S CRAZY.
I DON'T--WH--

383
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,832
SAID SHE WAS, LIKE,
INTERNALLY-BLEEDING NERVOUS.

394
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:51,028
AND HE KNOWS HOW, YOU KNOW,
I WANT TO BE DEDICATED TO ROGER.

395
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:53,340

YOU KNOW, SHE WAS A LITTLE SHY,

396
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:55,929
BUT I TRIED TO LET HER
KIND OF WARM UP TO ME

397
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57,517
AT HER OWN PACE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

398
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,621
SHE GAVE ME A HUG AT THE END.

399
00:14:58,725 --> 00:14:59,726
SHE SEEMED VERY SINCERE
ABOUT IT, SO--

400
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,417

00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,134
- 'CAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE MAD AT ME.

I DON'T LIKE BEING LIED TO.

450
00:17:14,585 --> 00:17:16,552
THAT'S MY BIGGEST PET PEEVE
IN LIFE.

451
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:19,866
ESPECIALLY MY FIANCEE,
MOTHER OF OUR CHILD,

452
00:17:19,969 --> 00:17:22,248
DELIBERATELY LIED--
Y-YOU KNOW, IT REALLY HURTS.

453
00:17:22,351 --> 00:17:24,457
IS THAT WHY YOU'VE BEEN
DUMPING THIS WHOLE TIME?

454
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,115
- YEAH. AND I HAD SANGRIA.

455
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:29,703
- WHAT ELSE
DID YOU NOT TELL ME?

456
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:31,705
- I THOUGHT YOU KNEW
I WAS DRINKING SANGRIA.

457
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,777
- SO WHY ARE YOU HOLDING HIM?
- JIONNI, I'M NOT DRUNK.

458
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:36,986
- DID YOU TELL STEPH
NOT TO TELL ME?

459
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,368
- YEAH. BUT I WAS GONNA
TELL YOU ANYWAY.

460
00:17:39,472 --> 00:17:42,268
I'M SERIOUS, IN THE SHOWER,
I'M LIKE, "I'M GONNA TELL HIM."

461
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:43,959
- SO YOU SAID TO STEPH,
"I'M HAVING A CIGARETTE.

462
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,030
DON'T TELL JIONNI,
AND I'M NOT GONNA TELL HIM"?

463
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:47,790
- YEAH. BUT THEN
I CHANGED MY MIND.

464
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:49,068
- WHAT KIND OF FIANCEE
ARE YOU?

465
00:17:49,171 --> 00:17:51,380
- I KNOW, THAT'S WHY
I CHANGED MY MIND.

466
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:53,037
I FELT GUILTY NOT TELLING YOU.
- OH, MY GOD.

467
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:54,556
- JIONNI, I TOLD YOU.
- OKAY.

468
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:56,868
- I FEEL LIKE [bleep]
BECAUSE BEING JIONNI'S FIANCEE,

00:17:56,972 --> 00:17:59,216
I SHOULDN'T BE GOING
BEHIND HIS BACK LIKE THAT,

470
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,839
SO I DEFINITELY [bleep] UP,

00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:03,530
I FEEL LIKE AN ASS[bleep].

MOMMY WAS WRONG,

00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,504
- ONE MORE TIME.

476
00:18:11,607 --> 00:18:14,507
- MOMMY WAS WRONG,
AND DADDY WAS RIGHT.

00:18:25,311 --> 00:18:27,934
- [laughs]

481
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:29,970
IT'S DEFINITELY A LITTLE ODD

482
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:31,696
'CAUSE HE NEVER SKIPS
THE GYM.

483
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,837

YOU KNOW HOW ROMANTIC I GET.

484
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:43,225

NO, I WON'T ALLOW YOU
TO BE THE ADVENTUROUS ONE

812

ONCE WE HAVE KIDS.

813

AND THEN DYING ON ME,
AND I GET TO BE A SINGLE MOM.

815
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:14,364
THAT WOULD SUCK.

816

I'M GONNA PUT THE KIBOSH
ON THAT REAL QUICK.

- WOULD YOU DO IT?

820
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:23,235
- NO. I'LL WAIT FOR YOU
AT THE BOTTOM.

821
00:30:23,338 --> 00:30:26,617

TO THIS IDEA

822

824
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:31,864
MAKE THIS PROPOSAL
HAPPEN THERE.

825
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:34,004
BUT I KNOW
HOW TO PLAY JENNI,

826
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:37,042
SO I STILL FEEL CONFIDENT THAT
I CAN GET HER ON THAT PLANE.

827
00:30:37,145 --> 00:30:38,526
I'M GONNA WRITE
MY BUCKET LIST DOWN.

828
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,907

YOUR BUCKET LIST DOWN.

829
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,460
WE'LL COME
TO SOME HAPPY MEETING.

830
00:30:41,563 --> 00:30:42,910

00:35:06,414 --> 00:35:09,037
- I'M GONNA DO A COUPLE
WITH THE BABY.

948
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,729
DO YOU HAVE
A SPECIAL SIDE OR...

949
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:12,524
- THIS IS MY BAD SIDE.

950
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:14,733
- SO THEN JUST SWITCH.

951
00:35:14,836 --> 00:35:16,804
- I WANNA MAKE SURE
I GET MY GOOD SIDE.

952
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:21,291
FOR SOME REASON, I POSE
REALLY GOOD ON THIS SIDE LIKE...

953
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:23,328

LIKE, I CAN'T--IT JUST--
IT DOESN'T WORK.

955
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:28,264
SO I HAVE TO POSE
ON THIS SIDE.

956
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,507
- YOU'RE GOING TO BRING HIM
FORWARD JUST A LITTLE.

957
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:32,854
YEAH, SO THAT HE'S NOT
SO SUNKEN BETWEEN YOU.

958

- YEAH, I LIKE IT.

963
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:48,076
- I THINK OVERALL
THE PHOTO SHOOT WENT GREAT,

964
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,457
A LITTLE BIT TOO LONG,

965
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:53,599
BUT MY FAVORITE PICTURE
WAS OF LORENZO IN THE PASTA BOWL

966
00:35:53,703 --> 00:35:56,154
'CAUSE I THINK
IT'S SO CUTE.

POOP MONKEY?

975
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,702
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

976
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:30,222
NOW THAT I HAVE EVERYTHING
AS FAR AS THE PROPOSAL GOES,

977
00:36:30,326 --> 00:36:32,569
AS MAPPED OUT AS I THINK
I CAN POSSIBLY HAVE IT,

978
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:34,330
IT'S TIME TO [bleep]

00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:35,779
I WANNA PUT THOUGHTS

I'VE ONLY BEEN THERE ONCE.
- WHAT'S IT CALLED?

989
00:36:59,596 --> 00:37:00,563

991

'CAUSE HE NEVER SKIPS
THE GYM.

00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:22,895
- OH,
IT'S A DRESS UP NIGHT TOO?

1001
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:24,621
- CAN'T HAVE A DATE NIGHT
WITH MY BABE?

1002
00:37:24,725 --> 00:37:26,554
WHAT'S UP?

1003
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:29,592
TODAY'S A SPECIAL DAY.
[laughs]

1004
00:37:29,695 --> 00:37:31,594
- SHUT UP.

1005
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:33,181
I'M READY TO GET READY.

1006
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:35,770
- LET'S GET READY
TO GET READY.

1007
00:37:35,874 --> 00:37:37,324
I CAN READ HER BODY LANGUAGE

1008
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:38,946
AND TELL THAT, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S THINKING,

1009
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:40,982
"TONIGHT COULD BE
A BIG NIGHT FOR ME."

1010
00:37:41,086 --> 00:37:44,123
[line ringing]

1011
00:37:44,227 --> 00:37:45,228
- HEY, BOO.

1012
00:37:45,332 --> 00:37:47,506
- HEY.

1013
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,612
- HOW WAS THE PHOTO SHOOT?

1014
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:50,958
- GOOD. UM...

1015
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,925
HE LOOKED REALLY,
REALLY CUTE.

1016
00:37:53,029 --> 00:37:55,169
- AW. ME AND ROGER
ARE ABOUT TO GO TO DINNER.

1017
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,964
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1018
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,931
- THE PILOT SOMETHING?

1019
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:01,865
- IS IT A FANCY RESTAURANT?
- I DON'T THINK SO.

1020
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:04,074
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT,
SO I DON'T KNOW.

1021
00:38:04,178 --> 00:38:06,456
HE'S FREAKING ME OUT
WITH THIS DINNER.

1022
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,321
IT'S A TUESDAY.

1023
00:38:09,425 --> 00:38:11,668
I WAS THINKING MUSCLE MAKER
OR TEA KETTLE.

1024
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:14,430
- IS HE PROPOSING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

1025
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:15,948
WELL, WE'RE SKIPPING THE GYM,

1026
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:17,225
WHICH, YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT USED TO.

1027
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,537
- WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU WALKED IN,

1028
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:20,850
IT WAS FIRST CLASS
AND CANDLES AND, LIKE,

1029
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:22,127
VERY CLASSY?

1030
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,232
- I THINK
IT WOULD BE COOL!

1031
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:27,235
- WELL, GOOD.
HAVE FUN AND GET DRUNK.

1032
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:29,376
- I GUESS.
WE'RE TAKING A CAB.

1033
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:32,068
- YEAH.
YOU'RE GETTING DRUNK.

1034
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:35,140
- I WILL CALL YOU EITHER
LATER TONIGHT OR IN THE MORNING.

1035
00:38:35,243 --> 00:38:36,452
- ALL RIGHT, HAVE FUN.

1036
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:39,075
- I WILL. LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU. BYE.

1037
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:41,802
- BYE.

1038
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:44,356
- PUT ON YOUR SUNDAY BEST, KID.
WE'RE GOING TO SEARS.

1039
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,185
- YE-AH.

1040
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:48,326
- IF I COULD READ
JENNI'S MIND RIGHT NOW,

1041
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:51,743
I THINK HER MIND
WOULD BE SAYING,

1042
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:53,883
"PLEASE LET THIS BE IT."

1043
00:38:53,986 --> 00:38:56,023
SO...IT JUST MAKES IT
THAT MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE.

1044
00:38:56,126 --> 00:38:57,990
YOU LOOK AMAZING.
AS ALWAYS.

1045
00:38:58,094 --> 00:39:00,061
I HAVE SEX WITH THIS GIRL
FROM TIME TO TIME.

1046
00:39:00,165 --> 00:39:01,477
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW HER OR NOT,

1047
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,272
BUT OCCASIONALLY.

1048
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:08,311
OCCASIONALLY BEING
THE KEY WORD THERE.

1049
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:12,557
READY?
- JUST STARTING TO GET HUNGRY.

1050
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,499
I'M LOOKING
AT THIS PINK LIMO,

1051
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:27,088
AND I LEGIT
ALMOST [bleep] MY PANTS.

1052
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:28,987
- MAYBE THAT'S ALL THEY HAD
FOR A TAXI.

1053
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:31,610
- WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT?
- IT MIGHT BE ALL THEY HAD.

1054
00:39:31,714 --> 00:39:34,026
- WHY ARE WE GOING
IN A PINK THING?

1055
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,649
- I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST ORDERED A TAXI.

1056
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:37,064
- I CAN'T BREATHE.

1057
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,617
LIKE, I CAN'T THINK.

1058
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:40,930
I'M, LIKE, STANDING HERE
DUMBFOUNDED, SHAKING.

1059
00:39:41,033 --> 00:39:42,794
- THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD
ANY LINCOLN TOWN CARS.

1060
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,796
- [laughing]
WHY ARE WE GOING IN THAT?

1061
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:47,143
- ROGER KNOWS MY FAVORITE
COLORS ARE PINK AND BLACK.

1062
00:39:47,246 --> 00:39:49,939
ROGER ALSO KNOWS THAT I WANT
A PINK DIAMOND RING.

1063
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:52,251
OH, MY GOD, THIS IS IT,
LIKE...

1064
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:53,529
I'M GONNA BE PROPOSED TO.

1065
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:56,877
MY HEART'S IN MY THROAT
RIGHT NOW.

1066
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:00,467
- THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO DO SOMETHING NUTS TONIGHT.

1067
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:01,813
- HOW SO?

1068
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:04,781
- I JUST REFERENCED PINK LIMO
WITH PINK DIAMONDS.

1069
00:40:04,885 --> 00:40:05,955
- ALL RIGHT.

1070
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:07,750
- OH, I'M LEAKING!

1071
00:40:07,853 --> 00:40:09,890
- CAN I SEE?
- AAH! HA HA!

1072
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:11,374
- I DON'T LIKE HEIGHTS.

1073
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:12,582
- I'M SURE YOU WON'T BE
THE FIRST PERSON

1074
00:40:12,686 --> 00:40:14,032
THAT [bleep] THEIR PANTS.

1075
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:15,999
I MIGHT [bleep] MY PANTS,
BUT I'M STILL GONNA DO IT.

1076
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:18,588
BASICALLY, IF [bleep] JENNI
DOESN'T JUMP OUT OF THIS PLANE,

1077
00:40:18,692 --> 00:40:19,900
I DON'T HAVE
A BACKUP PLAN.

1078
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,454
IT'S REALLY
ALL OR NOTHING.

1079
00:40:22,558 --> 00:40:23,869
- STOP!
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT!
