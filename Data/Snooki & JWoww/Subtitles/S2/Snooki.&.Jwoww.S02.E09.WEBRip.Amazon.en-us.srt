00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:04,805
- I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA GET
PREGNANT AT THE SAME TIME.

00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,774
- CAN'T WAIT FOR NEXT YEAR
TO START MAYBE TRYING.

3
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:08,409
- I WOULD LOVE
IF JENNI HAD A BOY

4
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,378
AND I HAD A GIRL,
BECAUSE THEN THEY CAN DATE

5
00:00:10,378 --> 00:00:12,180
AND GET MARRIED,
AND THEN THEY CAN MAKE

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,115
A SNOOKI-JWOWW BABY.

7
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:18,186
- I FIGURED WE COULD
MAYBE SKIP THE GYM,

00:00:18,186 --> 00:00:20,621
GO TO DINNER.

9
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,456

WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT?
- IT MIGHT BE ALL THEY HAD.

15
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,370

[Icona Pop's I Love It]

17
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,839

00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,194
* I ASKED YOU
TO SAY *

28
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:01,729
- THAT'S ALL THEY HAD
FOR A TAXI.

29
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,398
- WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT?
- MIGHT BE ALL THEY HAVE.

30
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,899
- WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT?

31
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,335
- THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD
ANY LINCOLN TOWN CARS.

32
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:11,172
- WHY ARE WE GOING
IN THAT?

33
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:12,306
- * ROMANTIC
ROMANTIC ROMANTIC *

34
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:14,342

AT THIS PINK LIMO,

35
00:01:14,342 --> 00:01:16,144
AND I'M LIKE,
"TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:17,378
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN."

37
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,380
WHY ARE WE GOING
IN A PINK THING?

38
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,316
- AND I LEGIT
ALMOST [bleep] MY PANTS.

39
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,452
MY HEART'S IN MY THROAT
RIGHT NOW.

40
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:25,686
- YOU DIDN'T WANNA GO EAT?

41
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:28,322
- [laughs]
I CAN'T EAT RIGHT NOW.

42
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,990
ALL I THINK OF IS
PINK DIAMONDS.

43
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,526
YOU KNOW, WHO GETS A PINK LIMO
WITHOUT PROPOSING?

44
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:33,994
- YOU'RE GOING ALL THE WAY
IN STYLE, COME ON.

45
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,496
- APPARENTLY, IT'S NOT
WHAT SHE EXPECTED.

46
00:01:35,496 --> 00:01:36,564
I DON'T KNOW.
- NO.

47
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,499
I WAS THINKING OF A CAB.

48
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:42,170
MY FAVORITE COLOR
IS PINK AND BLACK.

49
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:45,005
- WE'RE JUST GONG
TO DINNER.

50
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:48,742
WHY DO YOU HAVE THIS LOOK
OF TERROR?

51
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,011
- JUST CAN'T--
MY HEART'S IN MY THROAT.

52
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,580
- [chuckles]

53
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,715
- ONCE I GET A DRINK IN ME,
I'LL BE GOOD.

54
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,450
I'M IN MY DREAM LIMO.

55
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,519
IT'S PINK AND BLACK,
MY FAVORITE COLORS,

56
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,921
AND THERE'S
DISCO LIGHTS EVERYWHERE.

57
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,890
I FEEL RICH.

58
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,559

THE PINK LIMO HOME?

59
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:06,894
- SURE ARE.

60
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:10,398
- THIS IS THE PERFECT INTERIOR
TO DRIVE TO MY PROPOSAL.

61
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:12,032
I SHOULD HAVE MY HAIR DID
FOR IT

62
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:14,202
SO I'M NOT LOOKING
LIKE A REGULAR GIRL.

63
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:17,004
- YOU NEVER LOOK
LIKE A REGULAR GIRL.

WELCOME TO THE PILOT HOUSE.

74
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,697
HOW HE'S GONNA DO IT.

75
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,366
ALL I KNOW IS I'M FREAKING
THE [bleep] OUT

76
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,835

00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,245
- WHAT?
- SORRY.

82
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:58,612
I'M NOT USED TO YOU
BEING ROMANTIC.

00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,080
- [chuckles]

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,582

ONE OF MY DOGS?

85
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,518
- [chuckles]

86
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,886
- IS THAT WHY WE'RE HERE?

87
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,656
- WE'D ONLY BE AT DINNER
LIKE THIS IF IT WAS BELLA.

88
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,592
IF IT WAS NOEL,
WE'D BE AT HER FUNERAL.

89
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,662
I'M NOT A BIG CHAMPAGNE GUY,
BUT WHY NOT CELEBRATE?

90
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,564
- CELEBRATE WHAT?
- US.

91
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,031
JUST HAVING A NIGHT OUT.

92
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,468
CELEBRATE ME SKIPPING THE GYM.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

93
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:22,035
- I GUESS SO.

94
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:26,006
- THAT'S PRETTY BIG.

95
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,410
- YOU'RE NOT VERY TALKATIVE
THIS EVENING.

96
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,279
- MM-HMM.
I'M GONNA BRING UP

97
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:33,281
THE PRETTY FLOWERS.
I'M SORRY.

98

EVERYTHING
ABOUT TONIGHT'S PERFECT,

102
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:42,623
BUT I CAN'T EVEN APPRECIATE IT
AT THIS POINT

103
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:44,925
BECAUSE LIKE MY EMOTIONS
ARE LIKE--

104
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,527
IT'S, LIKE,
JUST SENSORY OVERLOAD.

105
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:48,796
- [laughs]
WHY ARE YOU NERVOUS?

106
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,063
- I DON'T KNOW.

107
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,300
- YOU'RE MAKING NERVOUS,
SO STOP.

PRESIDENT OBAMA SENT US
LORENZO'S SOCIAL SECURITY CARD.

116
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:15,689
LORENZO IS OFFICIALLY

00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,658
HE'S A CITIZEN
OF THE UNITED STATES,

118
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,093
AND HE'S, LIKE, A PERSON.

119
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,929
HOW IS HE SUPPOSED
TO WRITE HIS SIGNATURE?

120
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:25,098
SO THIS MEANS THAT NOW
HE CAN, LIKE, RUN FOR PRESIDENT

121
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,234
OR BE AN OLYMPIC.

122

IS HE GONNA BE ALIVE IN 3,000?

00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,863
HE'LL BE 12.

134
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:59,367
HOW OLD WILL HE BE
IN 2040?

135
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,435
- 2042, HE'LL BE 20.

136
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:02,803
- 2042?

137
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:04,805
THERE'S GONNA BE LIKE
SPACESHIPS AND [bleep].

138
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,108
I KNOW IT.
- 22, 32--HE'LL BE 30.

139
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,877
- HE'S GROWING UP
SO FAST.

140
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:12,145
- FIRST, THE UMBILICAL CORD...

141
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,581

144
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,454
- NOT READY FOR THIS.

145
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:25,025
- HE'LL BE 30 IN '42.
- 30 YEARS OLD!

146
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,159
AW.

147
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,397
- NO ONE EVER ACCUSED ME
OF BEING BRIGHT.

148
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,031
- I'M NOT BRIGHT.

00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,272
- [laughs]
- THIS IS GONNA MAKE ME SICK.

154
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,273
BUT IT'S OKAY.

155
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,842
SO, BECAUSE I'M SO NERVOUS,

156
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,043
I CAN'T STOP DRINKING.

00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,527
- I'M DRINKING EVERYTHING
AND ANYTHING

167
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:01,529
THAT I CAN POSSIBLY GET
MY HANDS ON,

168
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,230
BUT THE ONLY THING
I KEEP THINKING OF IS

169
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,665
"WHERE THE [bleep]
IS THIS RING?"

170
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,434
- FILLED IT UP
NICE AND FULL FOR YOU.

00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,473
- DID YOU TAKE TOMORROW OFF?

174
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,807
- NO, I DIDN'T TAKE
TOMORROW OFF.

175
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,543
- REALLY?

176
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:18,111
SO IT'S JUST DINNER?
- YEAH, BABE.

177
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,247
YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL BAD,
LIKE I DIDN'T DO ENOUGH.

178
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,349
- I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED.
I'M JUST A LITTLE DRUNK.

179
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,851
- [laughs]

180
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,853
- I DON'T WANT ANYMORE.
[burps]

181
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:26,987
- THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

182
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,321
- I'M GETTING
THAT WATERY FEELING

183
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,523
IN THE BACK OF MY THROAT
RIGHT NOW

184
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:30,924
WHERE I KNOW I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM

185
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,593
OR IT'S GONNA END UP
ON THE FLOOR.

186
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,127
SEE YOU IN ABOUT 20.

187
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,663
- [chuckles]

188
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,197
- I HAVE TO GO
THROW UP.

189
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:39,032
[coughs liquid
and groans]

190
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,668
SO NOW WHAT?

191
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,803
- CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN SOME DESSERT?

192
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:44,772
- I'M SO FULL
AND I'M SO GROSS RIGHT NOW

193
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,640
AND MY STOMACH
IS SUCH IN KNOTS,

194
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,108
BUT DESSERT'S ON ITS WAY,

195
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,477
AND, I'M LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD, YES,

196
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,144
OBVIOUSLY,
THE RING IS IN THERE."

197
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,980
- OH, I'M LEAKING!

198
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,347
- LET ME SEE.
- [shouts]

199
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,050
[laughter]

200
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:02,790
[upbeat synthesizer]

201
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,625
- HELLO.
- HEY, BABE.

202
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,093
- HOW'D YOU MAKE OUT
IN THERE?

203
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:09,730
- GOOD, EXCEPT FOR I DIDN'T PUT
ALL MY BOOB STICKY TAPE BACK ON.

204
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,932
- [laughs]

205
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,033
ALL RIGHT.

206
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,367
- SO NOW WHAT?

207
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,704
- CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN SOME DESSERT?

208
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:18,005
- SURE.

209
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:20,841
- OR POSSIBLY A 250-POUND
NAKED MAN IN YOUR BED?

210
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,110
- NO.
246 POUND, MAYBE.

211
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,277
- OKAY.

212
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,079
AFTER THAT MEAL,
IT'S PROBABLY 251, SO...

213
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,414
- THAT'S TRUE.

214
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,216
I'M SO FULL
AND I'M SO GROSS RIGHT NOW

215
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:31,318
AND MY STOMACH
IS SUCH IN KNOTS,

216
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:33,286
BUT DESSERT'S ON ITS WAY,
AND, I'M, LIKE,

217
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:37,224
"OH, MY GOD, YES, OBVIOUSLY,
THE RING IS IN THERE."

218
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:47,167
- THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD
CHEESECAKE RIGHT THERE.

219
00:07:48,536 --> 00:07:49,837
- I KNOW
THE RING'S SOMEWHERE,

220
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,905
SO I HAVE TO EAT
THE WHOLE THING,

221
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,207
OR AT LEAST STAB AT IT
BECAUSE IF IT'S IN THERE,

222
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:55,543
I NEED TO KNOW.

223
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:59,580
- NEED HELP WITH THAT,
OR YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

224
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,448
[laughs]

225
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,283
MINUTE BY MINUTE
BY MINUTE BY MINUTE,

226
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:07,320
I'M LOSING HOPE
THAT THE RING IS IN THERE.

227
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,927
- [chuckles]
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

228
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,597
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SPORT.
YOU WANT SOME HELP?

229
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,932
- MM.

230
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,368
THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA DO
SOMETHING NUTS TONIGHT.

231
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:25,072
- HOW SO?
- THE PINK LIMO THREW ME.

232
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:27,307
YOU KNOW WHAT I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA DO.

233
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,842
- YEAH, I THINK I KNOW.

234
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,177
I WASN'T SURE,
AND I DIDN'T WANNA SAY IT.

235
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,178
- WELL, I DIDN'T
WANNA SAY IT

236
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:34,047
IN CASE YOU TOOK OFFENSE
TO IT.

237
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,784
- [clears throat]
I GUESS THEN I FEEL BAD 'CAUSE--

238
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,586
- DON'T FEEL BAD, THAT'S WHY
I DIDN'T WANNA TELL YOU.

239
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,754
- I REALLY JUST INTENDED
A ROMANTIC DINNER

240
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:41,789
WITH THE TWO OF US, BUT...

241
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,223
- I JUST GOT
REALLY NERVOUS.

242
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,659
I WAS WOUND UP, AND THAT'S WHY
I DRANK LIKE A FISH.

243
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,060
- I FEEL BAD.
NOW YOU MAKE ME FEEL BAD.

244
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,496
I'M SORRY.
- IT'S OKAY.

245
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,131
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I STILL LOVE YOU.

246
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,601
I JUST REFERENCED PINK LIMO
WITH PINK DIAMONDS.

247
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:54,768
- I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

248
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,036
I'M ALMOST FEELING BAD.

249
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,105
I ALMOST FEEL
LIKE I'M TORTURING HER MORE

250
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,340
THAN I THOUGHT WAS EVEN
GOING TO BE THE CASE, YOU KNOW?

251
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,775
BUT I CAN'T GIVE UP
MY SECRET.

252
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:02,943
IT'S TOO GOOD.

253
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,477
I FEEL LIKE
THE WORST BOYFRIEND EVER.

254
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,313
- NO, IF YOU'RE NOT READY,
YOU'RE NOT READY.

255
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:07,848
I'M NOT PRESSURING.
- I LOVE YOU.

256
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,049
YOU'RE THE GIRL
I WANNA BE WITH.

257
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,784
BUT I DO SEE NOW,
LOOKING AT IT,

258
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,720
THAT MAYBE THE PINK LIMO,
IN HINDSIGHT,

259
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,821
WASN'T THE BEST IDEA.

260
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:15,322
I'LL DO A WHITE LIMO
NEXT TIME...

261
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:17,257
- MM-HMM.
- OR BLACK, PROBABLY.

262
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,291
MY APOLOGIES.

263
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,260
- I JUST WANT
A BIGGER RING NOW.

264
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,430
BETWEEN MY HEART ATTACK
ON THE WAY TO THE RESTAURANT,

265
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,165
ME THROWING UP
IN THE RESTAURANT,

266
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:28,035
AND NOW ME BEING
UBERLY DISAPPOINTED...

267
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,370
- LET'S GO BACK
IN OUR PINK LIMO NOW.

268
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,705
- YOU HAVE A GOOD DINNER?
- YES.

269
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,641
- AMAZING DINNER,
AMAZING.

270
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,208
- I FEEL LIKE ROGER
SHOULD FEEL BAD.

271
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,244
BUT THIS MIGHT BE
A GOOD WAY

272
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,446
TO, LIKE, LIGHT A FIRE
IN HIS ASS.

273
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,248
- I FEEL LIKE I DISAPPOINTED YOU
A LITTLE TONIGHT,

274
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,215
AND I FEEL BAD
ABOUT THAT,

275
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:45,085
BUT I'M SORRY.

276
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:49,256
- * CRAZY LOVE *

277
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,891
* WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU *

278
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,460
- I'LL JUST KEEP WAITING.

279
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,463
- THAT MUSTANG'S THE SAME YEAR
AS MY DAD'S, I THINK.

280
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,565
- BECAUSE OF TONIGHT,
I'M MAKING ROGER ADD

281
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,734
ANOTHER KARAT OR TWO
TO MY RING.

282
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:01,802
I'M A SCORNED WOMAN.

283
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:03,937
BYE, PINK LIMO.
- [chuckles]

284
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,539
WHAT'S THE WORST SHE'S GONNA DO?
NOT GIVE ME ANY SEX?

285
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,175
- YUP.

286
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,843
- PRETTY MUCH USED TO IT.

287
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,411
WHERE'S MY BUBBA?

288
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,613
- YEAH,
I MISS MY CHILDREN.

289
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,982
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

290
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,483
- CALLING NICOLE.

291
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,018
- JENNI.

292
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:20,053
SHE'S GONNA CALL ME
AND ASK [bleep].

293
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,554
PLEASE DON'T THROW ME
UNDER THE BUS TOO BAD.

294
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,824
SHE PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN LIKE
ME AS IT IS.

295
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,059
I'M A DUDE, BABE.
THAT'S WHAT DUDES DO.

296
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,962
- SCREW UP?
- WE SCREW UP FROM TIME TO TIME.

297
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,398
- YELLO?
- HELLO?

298
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,466
- HOW WAS YOUR DINNER?

299
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,269
- SNOOKS, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE THIS.

300
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,604
- WHAT?

301
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:40,607
- I FELT LIKE I WAS
ON AN EPISODE OF PUNK'D.

302
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,110
- WHAT?
[baby fusses]

303
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,045
- YEAH?
- GUESS WHAT PICKS US UP.

304
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,180
- WAIT, WHAT?

305
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,581
- GUESS WHAT PICKS US UP.

306
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,550
- A HOT AIR BALLOON.

307
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:54,354
- A PINK STRETCH LIMO.

308
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:55,989
- AND?

309
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,291
- AND GUESS WHAT
I THOUGHT.

310
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,993
- YOU'RE GETTING ENGAGED.

311
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,762
- YES.

312
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:05,465
DESSERT COMES...
AND STILL NOTHING.

313
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,468
ALL THROUGH DINNER,
I'M LIKE POUNDING DRINKS BACK.

314
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,837
I CAN'T KEEP
MY THOUGHTS TOGETHER.

315
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:12,605
I GO TO THE BATHROOM.
I END UP THROWING UP.

316
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,573
- [laughs]
- I COME BACK.

317
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:15,275
I'M COMPLETELY FINE.

318
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,376
- OKAY.

319
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,812
- HE NEVER PROPOSED.

320
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:21,114
- SO WHY'D HE GET
A PINK LIMO?

321
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,650
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
- ROGER, HELLO!

322
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,052
THE GIRL'S WAITING FOR YOU
TO PROPOSE,

323
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:26,553
AND YOU GET HER
A PINK LIMO?

324
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:29,656
THAT'S A TOTAL [bleep]TEASE,
AND ROGER DEFINITELY [bleep] UP.

325
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:30,891
LIKE, I'M GONNA PUNCH HIM.

326
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:32,159
WHAT AN ASS[bleep].

327
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,627
DID YOU TELL HIM YOU THOUGHT
HE WAS PROPOSING?

328
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,997
- YES, AND THEN
THE MOMENT HE REALIZED

329
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:39,299
WHAT HE DID, HE FELT
LIKE A COMPLETE ASS[bleep].

330
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,001
HE FEELS SO BAD
RIGHT NOW.

331
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,003
- THAT'S REALLY EMBARRASSING.

332
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,371
- IT, LIKE, KIND OF WAS.

333
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,206
I WAS, LIKE,
"AW, [bleep]."

334
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:48,408
- SHE'S LAUGHING IT OFF,
BUT, DEEP DOWN INSIDE,

335
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,777
I KNOW JENNI
WANTS TO CRY,

336
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:51,178
AND I JUST WISH
I WAS THERE FOR HER

337
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,880
TO CRY ON MY SHOULDER.

338
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,582
I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU.

339
00:11:55,582 --> 00:11:58,151
- OKAY, SORRY, BYE.

340
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,788
- [laughs]
GOOD-BYE.

341
00:12:00,788 --> 00:12:02,655
- HOW EMBARRASSING.

342
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,457
- WHAT A JERK-OFF.

343
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,160
- WHY WOULD YOU GET A PINK LIMO
FOR JUST A NORMAL DATE?

344
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,262
- MAYBE IT'S A DECOY
FOR ANOTHER TIME.

345
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:12,199
HE'LL DO IT WHEN SHE TOTALLY--
- WHEN SHE LEAST EXPECTS--YEAH.

346
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,701
HE PROBABLY
DID THAT ON PURPOSE.

347
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:17,838
- HE IS A BIG JOKESTER.
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.

348
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:20,373
- HE THINKS HE'S FUNNY.
- SHE WAS SO NERVOUS.

349
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,575
- I HAVE AMMO ON ROGER
FOR A GOOD, LONG TIME.

350
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,911
- MM-HMM.

351
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:27,014
- HE CAN CALL ME SHORT,
FAT, UGLY, WHATEVER HE WANTS.

352
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:30,217
AFTER THAT MOVE, FORGET IT.
- HE'S A DOUCHE.

353
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,819
- ONE DAY,
WILL YOU PROPOSE?

354
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,321
- YES, YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT.

355
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:36,223
YOU STILL LOVE ME
EVEN THOUGH I'M A DUM-DUM?

356
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,724
- MM-HMM.

357
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:40,393
AFTER TONIGHT, I DON'T EVEN
WANNA THINK ABOUT AN ENGAGEMENT.

358
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,262
- ME EITHER.
[laughter]

359
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,730
- [Bleep] YOU.

360
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,666
THANK YOU
FOR A LOVELY DINNER.

361
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,068
- [sighs]

362
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:51,004
THANK YOU FOR BEING
A LOVELY GIRLFRIEND.

363
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,508
I MIGHT HAVE GONE OVERBOARD
WITH THIS WHOLE THING,

364
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,278
BUT IN JUST A FEW DAYS,
IF SHE CAN HOLD ON THAT LONG,

365
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,147
AND SHE DOESN'T KILL ME
FOR ALL THIS,

366
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,916
THERE'S GOING TO BE
A GREAT ENDING TO THIS STORY.

367
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:05,618
both: I LOVE YOU.

368
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,855
- SORRY I'M AN IDIOT.

369
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,156
- IT'S ALL FORGIVEN.

370
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,291
I JUST EXPECT IT
SOONER THAN LATER NOW.

371
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,693
- GOOD THINGS HAPPEN
TO THOSE THAT WAIT.

372
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,964
- YOU'RE WAITING 2 1/2 YEARS.

373
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,465
HE'S, LIKE, TALKING ABOUT--

374
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,067
HE WANTS TO [bleep]
GO SKYDIVING,

375
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,401
WHICH I'M, LIKE, SO AGAINST.

376
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,502
- IT'S AWESOME.

377
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,371
WHO GOES RANDOMLY SKYDIVING?

378
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,405
HE'S GONNA PROPOSE.

379
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:27,074
I THINK
YOU SHOULD DO IT.

380
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,076
- I DON'T LIKE HEIGHTS.
- YOU SURE?

381
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,344
YOU WON'T BE THE FIRST PERSON
THAT [bleep] THEIR PANTS.

382
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:33,546
I MIGHT [bleep] MY PANTS,
BUT I'M STILL GOING TO DO IT.

383
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:39,252
- [Bleep].

384
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:41,521
- LOVING THE PURSE.

385
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,489
- I DON'T KNOW
WHY IT'S SO BIG.

386
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,891
- [laughs]

387
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,159
- SO I'M GOING DOWN
TO GET SOME LUNCH WITH JENNI,

388
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,660
AND SHE TOLD ME THIS STORY
ON THE PHONE

389
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,062
ABOUT THE PINK LIMO DATE,

390
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,430
BUT I NEED TO HEAR IT
IN PERSON.

391
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,466
LIKE, WHAT THE [bleep] HAPPENED?

392
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,402
- CAN WE HAVE IT OUTSIDE?
- SURE!

393
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,404
- OKAY.
- OH, I'M LEAKING!

394
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,906
- CAN I SEE?

395
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,407
- FEEL THAT?

396
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,577
- OH, MY GOD!
- [screams and laughs]

397
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,947
[laughter]

398
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,815
OH, MY GOD.
I NEED A--

399
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,383
- DO YOU WANT TISSUES?
- SEE, I KNEW--

400
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,019
[groans]
THIS IS BULL[bleep].

401
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,620
I SHOULD BE PUMPING
RIGHT NOW.

402
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,822
- DO YOU WANT TISSUES
TO STICK IN THERE?

403
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,191
- YEAH. I SHOULD'VE BROUGHT
MY NIPPLE PADS.

404
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,761
- IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

405
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:24,031
NICOLE'S A NEW MOM.
MILK'S COMING OUT.

406
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,333
GET SOME NAPKINS,
AND [bleep] STUFF YOUR BRA.

407
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:30,737
WE DID IT IN HIGH SCHOOL.
- MM-HMM.

408
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,105
ALL RIGHTY.

409
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,640
- HAVE A NICE DAY.
- AWKWARD.

410
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,641
THANKS.
- [laughs]

411
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,544
[up-tempo rock]

412
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:39,646
[line ringing]

413
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,949
[indistinct greeting]
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

414
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,117
- WHAT'S UP, ROGER?
- PLAN IS COMING TOGETHER,

415
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,020
AND I NEED A FAVOR
FROM YOU AND LAURA

416
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,321
IF YOU CAN DO IT.

417
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,722
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S UP?
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

418
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,824
NOW THAT I FEEL LIKE
THE HARDEST PART OF THIS

419
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,260
IS, YOU KNOW, OUT OF THE WAY,

420
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,962
BEING, YOU KNOW, SKYDIVING,

421
00:14:54,962 --> 00:14:58,331
AND MEETING WITH THE PEOPLE AT
FREEFALL ADVENTURES, AND NOW

422
00:14:58,331 --> 00:15:00,033
I HAVE TO MAKE EVERYTHING ELSE
HAPPEN, YOU KNOW?

423
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,602
MAINLY, I HAVE TO GET LAURA
AND SEAN TO DECORATE THE HOUSE

424
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:03,971
WHILE WE'RE GONE,
YOU KNOW?

425
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:06,539
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU GUYS
COULD MAYBE COME HERE

426
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:09,876
AND SET UP SOME, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, ROSE PETALS ON THE BED,

427
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:12,679
SOME--YOU KNOW,
A CHILLED BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE...

428
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,647
I'M GONNA SHOW HER
THAT I CAN BE PRINCE CHARMING.

429
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:16,683
JUST TO KIND OF KEEP THE DAY
GOING, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

430
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,085
LIKE, EVEN AFTER
WE GET HOME,

431
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,786
I JUST WANT TO KEEP
SURPRISING HER

432
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,088
AND KEEP SURPRISING HER,
YOU KNOW?

433
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,489
- ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.
- ALL RIGHT, PRAY FOR ME.

434
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,490
- WITHOUT A DOUBT,
WE GOT YOU.

435
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,125
- [chuckles]
ALL RIGHT, BRO.

436
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,526
- GOOD LUCK.

437
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:29,462
- I WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT THIS DINNER.

438
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,864
- UGH.
IT DIDN'T PISS ME OFF.

439
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,300
IT JUST--
- THAT WOULD PISS ME OFF.

440
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,801
- NO, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW--
- [Bleep] TEASE.

441
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,569
- HE'S NOT READY, BUT YEAH.
IT WAS LIKE A [bleep] TEASE.

442
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,539
I WAS EMBARRASSED
THAT I THOUGHT DIFFERENT.

443
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:40,573
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

444
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,110
- YEAH.
THAT IS EMBARRASSING.

445
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,711
I FELT SO BAD FOR YOU.

446
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,580
BIG PINK LIMO.
- WHAT KIND OF RING DO I WANT?

447
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,149
both: PINK DIAMOND.

448
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,685
- THE WHOLE TIME IN THE LIMO,
I'M LIKE THIS.

449
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,421
- JUST WAITING FOR IT?
- JUST WAITING.

450
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:56,023
AND SO IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
IN THE BEGINNING OF THE NIGHT,

451
00:15:56,023 --> 00:15:57,357
AND THEN IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

452
00:15:57,357 --> 00:15:59,026
SO OBVIOUSLY,
WHAT PART OF THE NIGHT

453
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,427
DO YOU THINK I EXPECTED?

454
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,694
- DESSERT.
- DESSERT.

455
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,230
- SO I PICKED OUT,
LIKE, A CHEESECAKE.

456
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,865
GOT THE CHEESECAKE.

457
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:08,101
NO RING.

458
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:11,371
- I HONESTLY WOULD LOVE
TO HAVE BEEN THERE

459
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:13,440
TO SEE JENNI, LIKE, STABBING
THE WHIPPED CREAM,

460
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,042
TRYING TO FIND THE RING.

461
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,143
LIKE, I FEEL SO BAD
FOR JENNI,

462
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,377
BUT HONESTLY,
THIS IS THE FUNNIEST THING

463
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:18,611
I'VE EVER HEARD.

464
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:21,048
- AT THE END,
WHEN I DIDN'T GET A RING,

465
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:23,683
I WAS LIKE, "DUDE, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA PROPOSE."

466
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:26,419
AND THEN I EXPLAINED WHY 'CAUSE
HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND IT.

467
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,155
AND HE'S LIKE, "I FEEL
LIKE A COMPLETE ASS[bleep]."

468
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,956
AND HE'S LIKE,
"PLEASE DON'T TELL NICOLE.

469
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:33,060
SHE'S GONNA THINK I'M MEAN
OR IT'S A CRUEL JOKE."

470
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,627
I'M LIKE, "WELL, IT KIND OF IS
A CRUEL JOKE,

471
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,563
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S WHATEVER."

472
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:39,166
AND THEN HE'S, LIKE,
TALKING ABOUT--

473
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,467
HE WANTS TO [bleep]
GO SKYDIVING

474
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:43,536
WHICH I'M, LIKE, SO AGAINST.
- IT'S AWESOME.

475
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,072
I THINK YOU SHOULD DO IT.

476
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:48,341
WHO GOES RANDOMLY SKYDIVING?
HE'S GONNA PROPOSE.

477
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,310
I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING
TO JENNI,

478
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,179
SO SHE, LIKE, THINKS OF IT
AND IS LIKE,

479
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,913
"OH, MY GOD.
HE'S GONNA PROPOSE."

480
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:55,348
SO I'M KEEPING IT IN MY HEAD.

481
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,549
BUT I'M LIKE,
"BITCH, YOU HAVE TO GO."

482
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,452
- JUST THINKING ABOUT IT
MAKES ME NAUSEOUS.

483
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:06,259
- NAPKIN'S FILLING UP.

484
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,095
YOU'LL KNOW ONE DAY.

485
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,365
[dog barking]

486
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,633
- AHEM.

487
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,502
TODAY, LAYNA FRIEDMAN
IS COMING BACK

488
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:17,104
TO SHOW ME THE ACTUAL RING.

489
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:18,105
[doorbell rings]

490
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,706
NICOLE WAS KEEPING JENNI
VERY BUSY.

491
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,940
KEEPING HER AWAY FROM ME,

492
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,775
GIVING ME TIME
TO PLAN ALL THIS.

493
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,111
AND NICOLE DOESN'T
KNOW IT YET,

494
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,479
BUT I DEFINITELY OWE HER
A BIG HUG AND A THANK YOU.

495
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:27,914
LAYNA!

496
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,649
- BIG SURPRISE.
- IS IT IN THERE?

497
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,850
- [laughing] YES!

498
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,884
- HOW ARE YOU?

499
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,153
VERY GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
COME IN.

500
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,221
- OH, MY GOD, ROGER,
I GOTTA TELL YOU--

501
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,123
- IS IT AMAZING?
I'M NERVOUS.

502
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,824
I'M BASICALLY AT THE POINT
OF NO RETURN NOW.

503
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:38,891
YOU KNOW, THE RING IS HERE.

504
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,993
- OKAY, YOU READY?
- I THINK SO.

505
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,663
- YOU SURE?
- YEP, I'M READY.

506
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,932
OH, MY GOD.

507
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,135
THAT IS INCREDIBLE.

508
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:50,403
BIGGER THAN I EVEN THOUGHT.
- YEAH.

509
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,440
- YOU GUYS ABSOLUTELY NAILED
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

510
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,674
ABSOLUTELY.
- OH, GOOD.

511
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:56,309
- LET'S HOPE SHE SAYS YES.

512
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,211
- [laughing]
OH, MY GOD.

513
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,012
- SHE'S--
WITH A RING LIKE THAT,

514
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:01,181
- WHY WOULD SHE
TURN YOU DOWN?

515
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,182
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

516
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,316
THE RING IS AMAZING,

517
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:04,484
AND IT'S EVEN BETTER
THAN I THOUGHT.

518
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:05,585
BUT IF SHE WANTS IT,

519
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:07,154
JENNI HAS TO JUMP
OUT OF THAT PLANE.

520
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,155
- THANK YOU SO MUCH, LAYNA.
- ABSOLUTELY.

521
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,356
- AND I'M GONNA CALL YOU
AND TELL YOU

522
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:10,790
HOW EVERYTHING WORKED OUT.
- PROMISE ME.

523
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,492
I WANT TO HEAR
ALL THE DETAILS.

524
00:18:12,492 --> 00:18:13,793
- I WILL, I'LL GIVE YOU
ALL THE DETAILS.

525
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,629
- OKAY. BYE.
- LAYNA, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

526
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:19,832
[sighs]
WOW, NOW WHERE DO I PUT THIS?

527
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,169
- YOU PLANNING TO KILL ME?
IS THIS WHAT'S GOING ON?

528
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:23,203
- YES.

529
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,771
I THINK SHE SHOULD JUST
COME WITH ME

530
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,905
AND BECOME A LAWN DART,

531
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,474
IF THAT'S THE WAY
GOD PLANNED IT.

532
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:29,242
- I'M FINE WITH THAT.

533
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,610
NO!
- [laughing]

534
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,844
- I'M NOT FINE WITH THAT.
- "I'M FINE WITH THAT"!

535
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:39,085
[alarm beeping]

536
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:41,688
- [weakly]
RISE AND SHINE.

537
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,655
- ARE YOU PLANNING
TO KILL ME?

538
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,023
IS THIS WHAT'S GOING ON?

539
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:45,258
- YES.

540
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,594
- I DON'T MIND.
YOU CAN DO IT AT THIS POINT.

541
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,196
- SO TODAY'S THE BIG DAY.

542
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:51,198
GOTTA GET MY GIRL READY
TO GO SKYDIVING, THAT'S ALL.

543
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,800
- I'M NOT GOING.
- YOU'RE GOING.

544
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,203
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
AFTER YOU STRETCH.

545
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:58,004
- STOP.
- ARMS UP HERE, LIKE THAT.

546
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,839
- YOU'RE BREAKING MY BONES.

547
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,208
- STRETCH 'EM RIGHT HERE.

548
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,509
THEN I'M GONNA DO ACROSS,
LIKE THIS.

549
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,311
- OWW!
YOU'RE ACROSS MY--

550
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,745
- WE'RE GONNA CROSS 'EM
LIKE THAT.

551
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,515
- [laughing] OW,
YOU'RE MAKING ME [mutters].

552
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,450
OUCH!
- STRETCH 'EM A LITTLE.

553
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,684
GOTTA STRETCH 'EM OUT
LIKE THIS. READY?

554
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,919
- [laughing]
OWW!

555
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:14,687
- TWO...THREE...

556
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,022
- [laughing]
- AND FOUR.

557
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,657
COME ALL THE WAY BACK.

558
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,958
[grunting] LIKE THIS.
- NO!

559
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,894
[overlapping chatter]
- HEY, THAT'S MY WIENER.

560
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,630
- [laughing]
STOP.

561
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,131
- [grunting]
GOOD.

562
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,500
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU'RE GONNA BE REFRESHED.

563
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,237
- [laughing]
YOU HURT MY LEG.

564
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:32,004
- NOW GET UP.

565
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,573
- OW. DON'T HIT ME.

566
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:35,242
- TODAY'S KIND OF
MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.

567
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,076
A LOT CAN HAPPEN.
A LOT CAN GO WRONG.

568
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,978
I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU
IF MY GIRLFRIEND'S

569
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,548
GONNA GET ON THE PLANE.

570
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,860
- IT'S ANYTHING
BUT THE TYPICAL PROPOSAL.

571
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,127
THEY'RE GONNA SET UP
A HUGE BANNER

572
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:57,330
IN THE FIELD WHERE WE LAND
THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW,

573
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,898
"JENNI, WILL YOU MARRY ME?"

574
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,467
AND THEN I'LL BE ON BENDED KNEE,
HOLDING THE RING,

575
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,001
WAITING FOR HER
TO GET THERE, YOU KNOW?

576
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,637
AND EVERYTHING JUST HAS
TO COME TOGETHER PERFECTLY.

577
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,038
"FEELING YOUR HAND IN MINE

578
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:08,341
AND LOOKING
AT THOSE GENTLE EYES."

579
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,042
I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.

580
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,029
[birds chirping]

581
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,398
- I DON'T WANT
TO GO SKYDIVING,

582
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,300
BECAUSE I ACCEPT MY FEARS.

583
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,767
I'M LIKE, ALL RIGHT,
I'M SCARED OF HEIGHTS.

584
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36,303
I'M NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING
WITH HEIGHT REQUIREMENTS,

585
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:37,470
AND I'M GOOD TO GO.

586
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,005
- IS THAT WHY YOU
DATED YOUR EX?

587
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,507
- [laughs]

588
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,609
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GO,
HONESTLY.

589
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,611
- AH.

590
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,880
ALLS I SAID WAS, "GET THERE,
TAKE THE CLASS."

591
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,582
SEE WHAT YOU THINK.

592
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,284
- I DON'T LIKE HEIGHTS.

593
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:52,819
- I'M SURE YOU WON'T BE
THE FIRST PERSON

594
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,287
THAT [bleep] THEIR PANTS.

595
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,389
I MIGHT [bleep] MY PANTS,
BUT I'M STILL GONNA DO IT.

596
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:58,024
I THINK SHE SHOULD
JUST COME WITH ME

597
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,626
AND BECOME A LAWN DART,

598
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,461
IF THAT'S THE WAY
GOD PLANNED IT.

599
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,129
- I'M FINE WITH THAT.

600
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,497
NO.
- [laughing]

601
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:06,333
- I'M NOT FINE WITH THAT.
- "I'M FINE WITH THAT."

602
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,168
OKAY, WELL...

603
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,737
I CAN'T MAKE YOU GO.

604
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,138
I WANT YOU TO GO.

605
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,840
I THINK--WILL YOU
AT LEAST TAKE THE CLASS?

606
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,241
- I GUESS.
- IT'S LIKE A 10-MINUTE,

607
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,709
15 MINUTE CLASS, I THINK.
I DON'T KNOW.

608
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:18,144
- OH, THAT'S ALL YOU NEED
TO JUMP TO YOUR DEATH?

609
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:21,147
- NO, YOU'RE ATTACHED
TO SOMEBODY.

610
00:21:21,147 --> 00:21:23,483
- YOU JUST WANT ME TO DIE.
I KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

611
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:27,053
- YOU OVER-THINK STUFF.
IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL.

612
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,925
- YOU WANT BABY WIPES?

613
00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:35,362
- YOU'RE NOT FUNNY.
- [laughing]

614
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:41,133
[imitating airplane engine]

615
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,804
OPEN UP THE HANGAR.

616
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:47,239
WHY DO I HAVE A FEELING
YOUR BOOBIES ARE GONNA POP OUT?

617
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,275
- I NEVER AGREED TO GO YET.

618
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,378
- I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS
BECAUSE I'M FULLY COMMITTED

619
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,680
TO THIS IDEA OF SKYDIVING

620
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,382
AND MAKING THIS PROPOSAL
HAPPEN THERE.

621
00:21:55,382 --> 00:21:57,784
SO IF I GET HER THERE,
AND SHE BAILS,

622
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,019
YOU KNOW, AND WON'T JUMP,

623
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,388
I REALLY
DON'T WHAT TO DO.

624
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,055
- STILL RECOVERING
FROM THE PINK LIMO.

625
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,057
- YOU JUST HATE MY GUTS,
DON'T YOU?

626
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,759
- LITTLE BIT.

627
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:14,534
- AH, SHOOT, THIS IS TOO MUCH
FOR ME TO HANDLE.

628
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:17,169
- I THINK YOU'RE FINE.

629
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,170
- HELLO.
- HOW ARE YOU?

630
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,672
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

631
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,908
UH, WE ARE INTERESTED
IN DOING A JUMP.

632
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:24,210
- ALL RIGHT.
FIRST TIME?

633
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:25,745
- FIRST TIME FOR BOTH OF US.
- YOU READY?

634
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:27,614
- I THINK I'M READY.
I DON'T KNOW--

635
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:28,915
- IS SHE READY?

636
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:29,982
- I'M NOT SURE
ABOUT MY GIRLFRIEND, BUT...

637
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,484
- ALL RIGHT.
- NO.

638
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:32,585
- YOU'RE NOT READY?

639
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:33,820
- YOU HAVE ANY
PRE-COUNSELING CLASSES

640
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,054
SHE COULD SIGN UP FOR OR--

641
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,656
- YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA
WATCH A QUICK VIDEO,

642
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,058
GONNA BRIEF YOU A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT,

643
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,927
AND THEN YOU'LL FILL OUT
YOUR PAPERWORK AFTER THAT.

644
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,128
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

645
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,564
SO THIS IS REAL QUICK.
SO YOU READY?

646
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:47,867
- YEP. SHOOT.
- ALL RIGHT.

647
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,438
- HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO FREEFALL ADVENTURES.

648
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:52,972
FOLLOWING THIS INTRODUCTION,

649
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:56,308

AN ASSUMPTION OF RISK,
ALSO CALLED A WAIVER.

651
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,281
- THE--OF THE GUY SAYING,
"YOU COULD POSSIBLY DIE,"

652
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,750
AND YOU SIGN YOUR LIFE AWAY.

653
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,951
- THEY HAVE TO SAY THAT.

654
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,519
YOU COULD LIFE A LITTLE MORE
ON THE EDGE.

655
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,854
- I FEEL LIKE I LIVE
LIFE ON THE EDGE.

656
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,956
- YOU DO? HOW SO?
WHAT DO YOU DO?

657
00:23:09,956 --> 00:23:12,459
- NO, I FEEL LIKE--
IN MY COMFORT ZONE I DO.

658
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:15,828
- A FULL 2 1/2 MILES
ABOVE THE GROUND.

659
00:23:15,828 --> 00:23:17,697
WHEN YOUR JUMP TIME
HAS ARRIVED...

660
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,166
- THIS, LIKE,
REALLY HAPPENING?

661
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,868
- IT'S HAPPENIN'.

662
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:24,604

- I'M IN!

666
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:30,176
- MY GIRLFRIEND'S
A BIT OF A BADASS.

667
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:31,277
SHE'S GONNA DO THIS.
- NO.

668
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,480
- SHE'S A BIT OF A BADASS.

669
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,981
- I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD
MAKE OUT MY WILL RIGHT NOW.

670
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,916
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
IT AIN'T [bleep] GOING TO YOU.

671
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,585
IT'S GOING TO MY DAMN DOGS.

672
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,287

675
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,297
- COOL.
- SO HAVE FUN.

676
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:54,100
- I'M GONNA THROW UP.

677
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,869
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET GEARED UP
AND LET'S GO.

678
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,506
- [grunts]

679
00:23:59,506 --> 00:24:00,807
DOES IT FIT?

680
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:03,042
- MY BOOBS ARE...

681
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:04,677
[zipper zips]
UHH! OKAY.

682
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:06,613
- THAT'S PRETTY FORM-FITTING
RIGHT THERE, GIRL.

683
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,414
- THERE'S THAT LOOK.
A DEER IN HEADLIGHTS.

684
00:24:08,414 --> 00:24:11,518
- YEAH, WAIT
TILL I'M UP THERE.

685
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:12,985
- IS IT WEIRD
THAT I JUST WANT TO SING

686
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,521
"HIGHWAY TO THE DANGER ZONE"
RIGHT NOW?

687
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:17,356
- GO [bleep] YOURSELF.

688
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,726
[speakerphone ringing]

689
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,160
- [Snooki on phone]
HELLO?

690
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,963
- SO I'M ABOUT
TO JUMP OUT OF A PLANE.

691
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,932
- YAY! YOU'RE DOING IT!

692
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:28,535
- YEAH, WELL, THERE'S STILL
A CHANCE TO TURN AROUND.

693
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:31,638
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW
UNBELIEVABLY HORRIFIED

694
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,072
I FEEL RIGHT NOW.

695
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,707
- I'M PROUD OF YOU.

696
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,643
I WOULD JUMP
OUT OF A PLANE.

697
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:38,545
- I, UH...
- [chuckles]

698
00:24:38,545 --> 00:24:41,013
- DO YOU WANT TO TAKE
MY POSITION?

699
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:42,982
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ONE LAST TIME

700
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,383
IN CASE ANYTHING HAPPENS.

701
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:46,653
- ALL RIGHT, IF YOU DIE,
DON'T HAUNT ME.

702
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,788
- I'M GONNA HAUNT THIS [bleep]
IF I DIE.

703
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,557
HE'S THE ONE THAT CAUSED ME
TO DIE EARLY,

704
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:52,291
SO I'M GONNA HAUNT YOU,

705
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:54,460
AND I'M GONNA CUT THE BITCH
THAT YOU'RE WITH AFTER ME.

706
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,563
- GOOD LUCK!
- THANK YOU.

707
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:58,765
GIVE LORENZO A KISS FOR ME.

708
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:00,232
- OKAY.

709
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,134
ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU.
HAVE FUN.

710
00:25:02,134 --> 00:25:03,570
- LOVE YOU TOO.
BYE.

711
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,771
- LET'S DO THIS, BABY.

712
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:07,940
- I FEEL LIKE I'M EITHER
GONNA PROJECTILE VOMIT

713
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,241
OR FAINT.

714
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,210
- I'M BASICALLY [bleep]

715
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,679
IF JENNI DOESN'T JUMP
OUT OF THIS PLANE.

716
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:13,913
I DON'T HAVE A BACKUP PLAN.

717
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:15,447
IT'S REALLY ALL OR NOTHING.

718
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:20,820
- * GENTLY ROLL YOUR EYES *

719
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,022
* AND MY MIND TAKES OFF
THROUGH THE CLOUDS *

720
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,757
* OF ME AND YOU *

721
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,058
- THEY'RE JUMPING
OUT OF A PLANE?

722
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,059
- YEAH.

723
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,260
- THAT'S ROMANTIC.

724
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,262
- I FEEL LIKE ROGER'S
GONNA PROPOSE.

725
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,666
100 BUCKS SHE CALLS BACK
IN AN HOUR: "I'M ENGAGED."

726
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,802
IF YOU JUMP OUT OF A PLANE,
HE'S GONNA PROPOSE.

727
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:37,369
- I'M CALLING IT.
- I--NO, I SAID IT!

728
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,705
YOU HAD NO IDEA.
- I'M CALLING IT.

729
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,239
ROGER'S DOING IT.
- THAT'S MY IDEA.

730
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,741
- ROGER'S DOING IT.
- THAT'S MY IDEA.

731
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:44,343
LIKE, THAT'S SO RANDOM--
"LET'S GO JUMP OUT OF A PLANE."

732
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:45,612
- OH, I CALLED THAT.

733
00:25:45,612 --> 00:25:48,014
- JIONNI, I SAID IT FIRST.

734
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:51,217
[baby babbling]

735
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,720
WE SHOULD GO SKYDIVING.

736
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,655
I WOULD LOVE THAT.

737
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,189
- OUR PROPOSAL SUCKED.

738
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:58,324
- NO, IT DIDN'T.

739
00:25:58,324 --> 00:26:00,526
IT WAS NICE AND ROMANTIC
AND NORMAL.

740
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,194
- EVERYONE'S JUMPING
OUT OF PLANES,

741
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,631
GETTING DOLPHINS AND [bleep].

742
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:06,098
- I DON'T NEED THAT.

743
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:09,636
YOUR PROPOSAL WAS AMAZING,
IT WAS ROMANTIC,

744
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:10,870
AND I LOVE MY RING,

745
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,271
AND YOU SHOULDN'T
FEEL BAD AT ALL.

746
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:13,439
'CAUSE YOU'RE AWESOME.

747
00:26:13,439 --> 00:26:15,207
- I WENT THE ROMANTIC ROUTE.

748
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:17,143
- AND THAT'S HOW I WANTED IT.

749
00:26:17,143 --> 00:26:18,945
I LOVED YOUR PROPOSAL.

750
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,512
AND I WOULDN'T CHANGE IT.

751
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,814
- THANKS.

752
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:24,784
[engine buzzing]

753
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,218
- HAVING A GOOD TIME.

754
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,187
TAKE SOME SORT OF DRUG.

755
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:30,222
OH, [bleep].

756
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,092
IS THIS HAPPENING?

757
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:37,296
- YOU GOT THIS.

758
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:39,231
- I'M SWEATING THROUGH THIS.
- I'M SWEATING TOO,

759
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,532
BUT IT'S JUST
'CAUSE IT'S HOT.

760
00:26:40,532 --> 00:26:41,968
- HEY, WELCOME
TO FREEFALL ADVENTURES.

761
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:44,036
HOW WE DOING TODAY?
- EXCELLENT. CAN'T WAIT.

762
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,872
- READY TO GO SKYDIVING?
- NO.

763
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:47,439
- ANYBODY AT HOME YOU WANT
TO SAY HI TO OR GOOD-BYE TO

764
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,507
BEFORE WE GO JUMPING?

765
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:49,909
- BYE, LORENZO!

766
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:51,678
- NICE.
- HOW 'BOUT YOU?

767
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,680
- BYE, LORENZO.
- [laughs] YEAH.

768
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,682
- YOU WANNA SAY GOOD-BYE
TO THE DOGS?

769
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,483
- BELLA AND NOEL,
YOU GET ALL OF MY STUFF.

770
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:58,985
THIS IS MY WILL
AND TESTAMENT.

771
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,419
I DON'T WANT
TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

772
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,455
BUT I FEEL LIKE THERE'S NOTHING
THAT I CAN DO TO STOP IT.

773
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,025
- LET'S GO.

774
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:07,259
YOU ALL RIGHT?

775
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,528
- NO!

776
00:27:09,528 --> 00:27:11,831
- YOUR CHARIOT AWAITS.

777
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:14,333
WATCH YOUR HEAD WHEN YOU
CLIMB IN, ALL RIGHT?

778
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:18,404
- I'M 100% FEELING LIKE

779
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:19,906
I SHOULDN'T BE GOING THROUGH
THIS RIGHT NOW.

780
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:22,174
DO I JUST, LIKE, CLOSE
MY EYES THE WHOLE TI--

781
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:24,443
LIKE, WHAT DO I DO?
I'M SO SCARED OF THIS.

782
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,278
I FEEL LIKE I'M HOPING
I PASS OUT

783
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,580
AND JUST WAKE UP
WHEN IT'S OVER.

784
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,216
- JUST JUMP.
IT'S THAT EASY.

785
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:33,052
- * TONIGHT,
IT'S JUST ME AND YOU *

786
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:36,889
* TONIGHT, IT'S JUST
ME AND YOU*

787
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:40,459
* WE'RE GOING OVER THE EDGE *

788
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,294
* WE'RE GOING
OVER THE EDGE *

789
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,430
* DON'T, DON'T, DON'T,
DON'T LOOK DOWN *

790
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,733
- BASICALLY [bleep] IF JENNI
DOESN'T JUMP OUT OF THIS PLANE.

791
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,000
I DON'T HAVE A BACKUP PLAN.

792
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,002
IT'S REALLY ALL OR NOTHING,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

793
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,271
WORST-CASE SCENARIO,
I'LL PAY ONE OF THEM

794
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,305
TO THROW HER
OUT OF THE PLANE.

795
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,874
- * OVER THE EDGE *

796
00:27:54,874 --> 00:27:57,409
* DON'T, DON'T, DON'T,
DON'T LOOK DOWN *

797
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,111
- LET'S DO THIS!

798
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:02,749
LET'S JUMP OUT OF A PERFECTLY
GOOD AIRPLANE, BABY.

799
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:05,051
- THIS IS SLIPPERY.

800
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:06,819
HOLY CRAP.

801
00:28:06,819 --> 00:28:08,387
- YOU READY TO GO SKYDIVING?

802
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:12,091
- NO.

803
00:28:12,091 --> 00:28:13,893
- MY BOYFRIEND'S GOING.

804
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:24,871
- WHEN YOU JUMP, YOU CAN SEE
FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON,

805
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:28,841
YOU CAN JUST SEE, LIKE,
THE ENTIRE EARTH BELOW YOU.

806
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:30,242
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "WOW."

807
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:32,678
- * BABY, BABY,
YOU LOOK SO MEAN *

808
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:35,782
* ON THE COVER OF A MAGAZINE *

809
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:38,951
* BABY, BABY,
YOU LOOK SO FINE *

810
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:41,387
- I JUST WANT TO YELL,
"DON'T DO THIS."

811
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:42,822
AND AS I'M ABOUT TO YELL,
"DON'T DO THIS..."

812
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:44,156
- * YO' A BAD MOTHER-- *

813
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,424
- WE JUMP.

814
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,159
AND I BLACK OUT.
THAT'S IT.

815
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,494
DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.

816
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,838
- [laughing]

817
00:28:58,838 --> 00:29:01,407
- NICE!
- THAT WAS BAD-ASS.

818
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,642
I WOULD DEFINITELY
DO THAT AGAIN.

819
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:08,981
THE MOMENT THE PARACHUTE
GOES OUT,

820
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,549
EVERYTHING IS, LIKE,
PROCESSING.

821
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:14,520
LIKE, "HOLY [bleep], I'M LIKE
THOUSANDS OF FEET IN THE AIR."

822
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,823
I'M--I'M SO SCARED.

823
00:29:16,823 --> 00:29:17,957
I'M LOOKING AT THE GROUND.

824
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,426
EVERYTHING'S GOING LIKE,
"WAH, WAH, WAH."

825
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,895
- [laughs]

826
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,299
- I SEE JENNI NOW, AND IT'S
LIKE, "OH, [bleep]," YOU KNOW?

827
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:30,702
IT'S TIME. THE D-DAY MOMENT
IS HERE AND IT'S HAPPENING,

828
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:32,238
AND YOU'RE THINKING,
"CAN SHE READ THE SIGN YET?

829
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,841
CAN SHE READ IT NOW?
CAN SHE READ IT NOW?"

830
00:29:34,841 --> 00:29:36,876
- WHOO! WHOO!

831
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:38,845
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

832
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:42,214
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

833
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,482
- COME OVER HERE.

834
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:46,452
- [chuckling]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

835
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,120
[laughing]
OHH!

836
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,122
- I LOVE YOU...

837
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,859
MORE THAN YOU CAN
EVER IMAGINE.

838
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:56,762
I WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.

839
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,397
- OHH.
- WILL YOU MARRY ME?

840
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:00,900
- [laughing]
OH, MY GOD!

841
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,969
OHH!

842
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,571
I'M SO...
[laughing, murmuring]

843
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:06,939
- IS THAT A YES?

844
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:09,175
- YES!

845
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:12,344
- * WITHOUT YOUR LOVE *

846
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,613
- HOLY...
YEAH!

847
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:16,115
THAT'S MY RING!

848
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,583
- DID I DO GOOD?

849
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:18,951
CAN I PUT IT ON?

850
00:30:18,951 --> 00:30:21,053
- YEAH.
I'M SORRY, I'M SHAKING.

851
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,989
YOU JUST MADE ME
JUMP OUT OF A PLANE.

852
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:24,356
[laughing]
IF IT FITS...

853
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:26,192
- LET'S SEE.

854
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:30,796
- OHH.

855
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,364
- [laughs]

856
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:33,832
- [laughing]
THANK YOU!

857
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:36,535
- THAT'S REALLY IT.
I MEAN, WHEN WE LANDED,

858
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:38,237
HAD A COUPLE GLASSES
OF CHAMPAGNE

859
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:39,671
AND WENT HOME.

860
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,706
- THAT'S IT?

861
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,608
I FEEL A LITTLE PISSED
RIGHT NOW

862
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:44,376
JUST BECAUSE
I'M JUST WAITING FOR HER

863
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,512
TO SAY, "I'M ENGAGED,"
AND SHE DOESN'T.

864
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:48,647
- YEAH, WHAT ELSE
IS THERE SUPPOSED TO BE?

865
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,682
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

866
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,353
- [laughing]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

867
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,055
- "X" MARKS THE SPOT, BABY.

868
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,657
- [laughing]
OH, MY GOD! BABE!

869
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,428
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
- ARE YOU HAPPY?

870
00:31:02,428 --> 00:31:04,263
- YEAH, WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

871
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:05,631
[onlookers cheering]

872
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:07,366
I WANTED TO KILL--

873
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,135
I WANTED TO KILL YOU
UP THERE.

874
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:11,303
- OH, MY GOD,
THAT WAS CRAZY.

875
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,504
YOU'RE STILL SHAKING.

876
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:13,739
I WAS LIKE, "I HOPE
SHE CAN READ THE SIGN

877
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,574
AS SHE'S COMING IN."
- I COULDN'T.

878
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,243
I HAD MY EYES CLENCHED.

879
00:31:17,243 --> 00:31:19,111
- I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU.

880
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,513
I'M THE HAPPIEST GIRL
IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW.

881
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:22,814
- WOULD YOU DO IT AGAIN?
- NO.

882
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:23,849
- NO?
- NEVER.

883
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:26,452
- I WOULD.
- NEVER, NEVER, NEVER.

884
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:28,554
- RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE
THE LUCKIEST GIRL IN THE WORLD.

885
00:31:28,554 --> 00:31:29,855
I HAVE THE PERFECT MAN,

886
00:31:29,855 --> 00:31:32,624
I HAVE THE PERFECT ENGAGEMENT,
THE PERFECT RING.

887
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:33,960
- WAS IT THE PERFECT ENGAGEMENT,
THOUGH?

888
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,127
'CAUSE IT WAS LIKE--
- YES!

889
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,462
- THERE WAS A LOT OF TERROR
INVOLVED IN IT.

890
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:37,663
- WELL, THE PERFECT ENGAGEMENT

891
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:39,966
AFTER I GOT ON MY FEET
AND LANDED.

892
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,333
- I'M A LITTLE RELIEVED.

893
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:42,334
YOU SAID YES, SO...

894
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,403
THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.

895
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,005
- MM, THANK YOU.

896
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,342
IT'LL SINK IN
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

897
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,710
- RIGHT?

898
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,045
IN THE MEANTIME, DO YOU--
COULD I INTEREST YOU

899
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:55,047
IN A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE
TO CELEBRATE?

900
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:56,415
I HAVE A LITTLE SETUP
OVER HERE.

901
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:58,784
- YOU DO?
- YES.

902
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,686
- YES.

903
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,821
OHH...

904
00:32:02,821 --> 00:32:04,356
IT'S MUCH BETTER
THAN THE RESTAURANT.

905
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,325
- RIGHT?
- I'LL REMEMBER THIS DAY.

906
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:08,627
- I'LL REMEMBER
THIS DAY.

907
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:10,429
CAN I ASK
HOW BIG IT IS?

908
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,164
- BIG.

909
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,300
- IS IT?
- 7.

910
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,667
- 7?

911
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,436
OH HO, MY BABY DID GOOD.

912
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,905
- [laughing]

913
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,140
- YEAH.

914
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,809
I LITERALLY CANNOT STOP
LOOKING AT THIS RING.

915
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:25,011
THIS THING IS [bleep] CRAZY.

916
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:26,912
I'VE NEVER OWNED
ANYTHING THIS NICE.

917
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:28,580
AND I JUST KEEP
LOOKING AT IT LIKE,

918
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,217
MY FAIRY TALE
HAS COME TRUE.

919
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:32,751
- CHEERS.

920
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,053
- SORRY.

921
00:32:34,053 --> 00:32:35,721
[giggling]
IT'S NICE.

922
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,289
IT'S VERY NICE.

923
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:39,525
- TO 2 1/2 YEARS TOGETHER.

924
00:32:39,525 --> 00:32:42,794
AND HAVING BEEN THROUGH IT ALL,
I THINK, REALLY.

925
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,731
AND FINALLY, IT'S OUR DAY.

926
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:47,799
- FOR THE FIRST TIME,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

927
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,867
I'M SPEECHLESS.

928
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:51,037
- THAT IS A FIRST.

929
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,642
- THANK YOU.

930
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:57,709
- I LOVE YOU.

931
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,578
- I LOVE YOU.

932
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,582
THAT'S NUTS
WHAT YOU JUST DID.

933
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,051
- [chuckles]

934
00:33:05,051 --> 00:33:08,154
FOR ME, IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING
I'LL NEVER FORGET.

935
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,156
- FOR ME TOO.

936
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:13,192
YOU'RE WITH ME
FOR LIFE NOW.

937
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:15,327
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

938
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,163
- MY OVERWHELMING FEELING
RIGHT NOW IS ONE OF RELIEF.

939
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:18,630
BUT IT'S ALSO ONE
OF EXCITEMENT

940
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,899
THAT, YOU KNOW,
I NOW HAVE A FIANCEE.

941
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,301
- HOW FANCY.

942
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:23,669
- A FIANCEE.

943
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,071
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

944
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,672
YOU WANNA GET OUT
OF THIS GEAR?

945
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,240
- YEAH, I CAN'T STOP
STARING AT MY RING.

946
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,841
MAYBE THAT'S WHY I'M NOT--

947
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,711
I'M JUST SO HAPPY
ABOUT THE RING.

948
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,380
- I DID GOOD, BABY.

949
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,282
- YOU DID.
- I DID GOOD.

950
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:39,085
EVERYTHING TODAY, I COULDN'T
HAVE PICTURED IT BETTER.

951
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:40,819
I COULDN'T HAVE
PLANNED IT BETTER.

952
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:42,454
AND NOW, THE SUN'S SETTING,

953
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:44,323
AND, UH, IT WAS JUST...

954
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:45,824
- AMAZING.
- VERY POETIC.

955
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:47,126
IT WAS--IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

956
00:33:47,126 --> 00:33:48,294
- I REMEMBER YOU.

957
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:49,828
- REMEMBER ME?
I'M BACK AGAIN.

958
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:51,097
I MISSED YOU.

959
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:52,631
- I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
THE FIRST TIME.

960
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:54,100
- OH? WHY IS THAT?

961
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,768
- TODAY WAS AMAZING.
IT WAS PERFECT.

962
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:57,969
IT WAS VERY SPECIAL.

963
00:33:57,969 --> 00:34:00,172
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD
BE THIS LUCKY IN LOVE.

964
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:02,208
ESPECIALLY WITH
A GUIDO FROM THE SHORE.

965
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:05,577
- NICOLE'S GOING TO BE JEALOUS.

966
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:07,346
- THAT'S MY BABE!

967
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,583
SO I'M CALLING NICOLE RIGHT NOW
TO TELL HER

968
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:13,819
ABOUT THE SKYDIVING
TRIP,

969
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,154
BUT NOT TO TELL HER
THAT I'M ENGAGED,

970
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:16,355
BECAUSE I WANT TO SAVE THAT

971
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:18,957
FOR WHEN I'M FACE TO FACE
WITH HER.

972
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,160
- HELLO?
- HEY, BOO.

973
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,894
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

974
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,431
- NOTHING.
I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE JUMP.

975
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:26,965
- HOW WAS IT?

976
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:31,637
- I WAS LITERALLY SCARED
OUT OF MY [bleep] MIND

977
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:33,439
FROM THE BEGINNING
TO THE END,

978
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:34,440
WHEN I LANDED.

979
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,243
- WHAT ELSE HAPPENED?

980
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,010
- WELL, THAT'S--
THAT'S REALLY IT.

981
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,747
I MEAN, WHEN WE LANDED,
HAD A COUPLE GLASSES

982
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,982
OF [bleep] CHAMPAGNE
TO CELEBRATE,

983
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:45,517
AND WENT HOME.

984
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:46,652
- THAT'S IT?

985
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,954
I FEEL A LITTLE
PISSED RIGHT NOW,

986
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,590
JUST BECAUSE I'M JUST WAITING
FOR HER TO SAY, "I'M ENGAGED,"

987
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,958
AND SHE DOESN'T.

988
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,560
- YEAH, WHAT ELSE
IS THERE SUPPOSED TO BE?

989
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,728
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

990
00:34:56,728 --> 00:34:58,764
- [laughing] COME ON, SNOOKS,
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

991
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:00,999
- I DON'T KNOW,
I'M [bleep] CRAZY.

992
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,335
WHATEVER.
- YEAH. WOW.

993
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,437
I'LL LET YOU GO.
I LOVE YOU.

994
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,740
- OKAY, LOVE YOU.
GLAD YOU HAD FUN. BYE.

995
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,242
- [laughing] BYE.

996
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:12,178
- BULL[bleep]!

997
00:35:12,178 --> 00:35:13,312
HE DIDN'T PROPOSE.

998
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,746
I FEEL SO BAD FOR JENNI.

999
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:16,615
I HONESTLY WANT TO KICK
ROGER RIGHT NOW.

1000
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,617
- JENNI'S BIOLOGICAL CLOCK
IS TICKING.

1001
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20,186
- SO IS ROGER'S.

1002
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:22,087
- ROGER MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO GET IT UP SOON.

1003
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:23,322
- [giggles]

1004
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,924
IT'S PISSIN' ME OFF.

1005
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,559
THEY'RE NEVER
GONNA GET ENGAGED.

1006
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,328
- A REAL JERK-OFF.

1007
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:34,900
- THERE'S MORE SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW
ON THE WAY.

1008
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,369
- AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW!

1009
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:42,208
- HOME SWEET HOME, BABY.

1010
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,609
- YAY.

1011
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,844
IT'S THE BEST DAY OF MY LIFE.
- YEAH?

1012
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,879
- WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF THE JUMP.

1013
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,216
- IF I HAD TO PUT
A NUMBER ON TODAY

1014
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:51,550
ON A ONE-TO-TEN SCALE,
I'D GIVE IT A TEN.

1015
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,219
BUT EVEN AFTER WE GET HOME,

1016
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,386
I'M GONNA HAVE
A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR HER.

1017
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,255
I THINK I'M FINALLY
GONNA GET LAID.

1018
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,726
- AW, THANK YOU.

1019
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:03,462
- BUBBA!

1020
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,931
- WHAT'S THAT?
WHAT ARE THEY IN?

1021
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:07,833
- WHAT IS THAT?
[door closes]

1022
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,436
- WALKING INTO THE HOUSE,
AND THE FIRST THING I NOTICE

1023
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:12,338
IS DIESEL'S IN A TUXEDO,

1024
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,240
AND NOEL AND BELLA
ARE IN, LIKE,

1025
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,374
LITTLE WEDDING DRESSES.

1026
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:17,243
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS.

1027
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:19,010
- HEY, WHAT'S THIS?

1028
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,712
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

1029
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,880
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1030
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,115
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS, MONKEY.

1031
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,417
- [laughing] WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

1032
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:27,253
- DID YOU HAVE JOEY
COME HERE WHEN I WAS GONE?

1033
00:36:27,253 --> 00:36:28,520
- I DON'T KNOW, MONKEY.

1034
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,789
- THERE'S ROSE PETALS
GOING UP THE STAIRS,

1035
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,724
AND I'M LIKE,
"OH, DEAR [bleep].

1036
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:34,493
IS THIS LIKE
ANOTHER SURPRISE?

1037
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:36,262
- WHAT IS IT?
- WHAT IS THIS?

1038
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:37,729
[laughing]

1039
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:39,398
COULD HAVE STARTED A FIRE.

1040
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,767
MY BEDROOM IS LIT UP

1041
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:44,503
BY, LIKE, THOUSAND,
I FEEL, CANDLES.

1042
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,305
THERE'S ROSE PETALS
ON THE BED,

1043
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:49,775
HE HAS CHOCOLATES AND OYSTERS
AND SHRIMP AND CHAMPAGNE.

1044
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:53,078
AND I'M JUST LIKE,
"WHAT THE [bleep] IS GOING ON?"

1045
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,112
OH, NO.

1046
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:56,715
- THIS IS TO PUT YOU
IN THE MOOD.

1047
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,017
- STILL NOT IN THE MOOD.
- [laughs]

1048
00:36:59,017 --> 00:37:00,185
- I'M KIDDING.

1049
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:02,621
- CAN I--CAN I INTEREST YOU
IN AN OYSTER

1050
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:03,889
OR 30, MAYBE?

1051
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,792
[both laugh]

1052
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:09,961
NOW, EAT SOME OYSTERS,
DAMN IT.

1053
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:11,630
- [laughing] CAN I JUST
GO TO THE BATHROOM?

1054
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,465
- SERIOUSLY, WHEN
YOU GET OUT OF THE BATHROOM,

1055
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:14,733
YOU BETTER START
EATING OYSTERS.

1056
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,167
- IT'S BEEN
LIKE TWO HOURS.

1057
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:19,638
THIS IS UNREAL.

1058
00:37:19,638 --> 00:37:21,206
[door shuts]

1059
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,575
- [chuckling]
I SHOULD SPRAWL OUT ON HERE.

1060
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,844
I WISH I HAD A PAIR
OF WHITEY TIGHTIES.

1061
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:26,845
I DON'T THINK I DO.

1062
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,351
WELL, THOSE
ARE PRETTY CLOSE.

1063
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,432
JUST TO BE SURE THAT TONIGHT
IS GOING TO, UH,

1064
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:49,335
BE A LUCKY ONE FOR ME,
I TAKE SOME OF THE CHOCOLATES

1065
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:51,437
THAT WE HAVE THERE
AND MAKE AN ARROW

1066
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,939
SO THAT THERE'S NO DENYING
THE GENERAL REGION

1067
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,775
IN WHICH
SHE SHOULD PLAY IN.

1068
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:59,778
[sexy music]

1069
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:00,779
- [laughing]

1070
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,482
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1071
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:04,816
- "X" MARKS THE SPOT, BABY.

1072
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,485
- OH, MY GOD!

1073
00:38:06,485 --> 00:38:08,019
BABE!

1074
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,555
- JUST COME LOVE ME.

1075
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:11,222
- [laughing]

1076
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:12,691
- I WAS TRYING
TO SET UP AN ARROW.

1077
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:15,093
IT DIDN'T REALLY
WORK OUT TOO GOOD.

1078
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:16,395
[both laughing]

1079
00:38:16,395 --> 00:38:18,564
- HE'S BASICALLY SAYING,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

1080
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:19,965
"FOLLOW THE ARROW."

1081
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:21,833
BUT BECAUSE ROGER
COULDN'T MAKE THE ARROW RIGHT,

1082
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:25,804
IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG BLOB
OF CHOCOLATE ON HIS STOMACH.

1083
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,774
- [chuckling]

1084
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,609
- YOU LOOK LIKE

1085
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:33,679
YOU SHOULD
BE IN TITANIC RIGHT NOW!

1086
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:36,382
- DO YOU WANT TO PAINT ME?

1087
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:38,517
- [laughing]
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

1088
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,521
- I LOVE YOU. MM!

1089
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:44,122
- I LOVE YOU.

1090
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:47,225
TODAY HAS BEEN ONE
OF THE BEST DAYS OF MY LIFE.

1091
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:50,061
IT WENT FROM, LIKE,
EXTREME, PURE FEAR

1092
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,631
TO THE HAPPIEST MOMENT
THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET,

1093
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:55,601
EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER
FOR THE HISTORY OF MY LIFE.

1094
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:58,570
BEST DAY EVER.

1095
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,573
ROGER'S DEFINITELY GONNA
GET SOME [bleep] TONIGHT.

1096
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:04,676
GIVE ME TEN MINUTES.

1097
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,745
SO I DRAW THE BATHTUB

1098
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,414
AND GET IT READY
WITH CANDLES

1099
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:09,781
AND NICE BUBBLY,

1100
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,650
AND I GOTTA BRING
CHAMPAGNE IN THERE.

1101
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,652
AND ROGER'S LIKE,
"I'LL BE THERE IN TEN MINUTES,"

1102
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:16,422
OBVIOUSLY TO GET
OUR GROOVE THING ON.

1103
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:22,628
- [snoring]

1104
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:24,663
- BABE!

1105
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:27,566
SO I'M SITTING HERE
WAITING FOR MY FIANCE,

1106
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:29,968
AND I'M IN THE HOT TUB
WAITING FOR 45 MINUTES.

1107
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,202
YEAH.

1108
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,971
- [snoring]

1109
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:35,140
- BABE!

1110
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,809
[snoring continues]

1111
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:39,845
- SERIOUSLY?

1112
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,350
all: BACHELOR PARTY!
BACHELOR PARTY!

1113
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,318
[all cheering]

1114
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,488
- THIS IS GONNA BE
A LONG NIGHT.

1115
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:53,559
[crash, glass breaks]
- OHH! OH, MY GOD!

1116
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,226
- BOTTOMS UP, KIDS.

1117
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,995
- SO, IN THE LAST NINE MONTHS,

1118
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,730
THE ONLY SHOT
THAT I'VE TAKEN

1119
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,466
IS MY OWN BREAST MILK.

1120
00:40:00,466 --> 00:40:02,468
- ARE YOU GONNA BE GOOD?
- YES.

1121
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:05,070
- OKAY.
- NO KOOKA OR CARTWHEELS.

1122
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,372
- NICOLE IS LITERALLY
RAPING EVERYONE.

1123
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:11,309
SHE IS ON LAURA, SHE'S ON DEENA,
SHE'S ON RYDER, SHE'S ON ME.

1124
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:13,211
- SURPRISED I DIDN'T, LIKE,
TEAR MY VAGINA OPEN

1125
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,613
WITH MY STITCHES.

1126
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,381
- I'M A GOOD MOM!
- AAH!
