21
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:40,408
- OH, DON'T EVEN GO THERE.

22
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:42,676
NICOLE KEEPS ASKING IF ROGER

AND I THINK SHE'S DEFINITELY
THE GIRL FOR ME,

36
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:09,137
AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE IT
TO THAT NEXT STEP,

37
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:11,205
WHICH, OBVIOUSLY,
IS GETTING ENGAGED.

38
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:14,342
AND HOPEFULLY SHE'LL ACCEPT,
AND, YOU KNOW, THEN--

39
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:15,709
- WOW, THAT WOULD BE
EMBARRASSING, IF SHE SAID--

QUITE EMBARRASSED.

GOOD CHOICES IN MY LIFE.

AND, YOU KNOW,
IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD

00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,693
TO HAVE MY DAD ENDORSE
THAT WHOLE IDEA

I WANT TO JUST SIT DOWN

BY PUTTING IT IN FRESHWATER.

125
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:55,803

00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,854
- OH, C--WHAT?
GET OUTTA HERE.

136
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,189
I AM NOT LISTENING
TO THEM SCREAM.

137
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,691
- [laughing]

138
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,860
- I KNOW LOBSTERS MAKE
A SCREAMING NOISE

139
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,894
WHEN THEY'RE BEING BOILED.

140
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,496
I HEARD IT IN MIAMI.

141
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,098
- OH, THERE YOU GO, BUDDY.

142
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,334
- SEE YA.
NOT LOOKING.

143
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,436
- OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT,
BROTHER.

144
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:30,504
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE SO AWFUL.

145
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,341
IT FREAKS ME OUT.

146
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:34,675
- THEY DON'T SCREAM.

147
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,743

- OOPS.

148
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:36,810

151
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:41,949
- NO, THEY DON'T MAKE
ANY NOISE WHATSOEVER.

152
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,183
- EEK.

153
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,251
- PFFT.

154
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:46,720
LOBSTERS DO NOT SCREAM
WHEN BOILED.

155
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,589
THEY DON'T HAVE
VOCAL CHORDS.

156
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,657
EVER SEEN A LOBSTER
ON AMERICAN IDOL?

157
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:50,658
NO.

158
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,259
I SHOULD CHECK THESE THINGS.

159
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,795
- I GOTTA GO FIX AN EYELASH.
IT'S BUGGING ME.

160
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:55,963
EW, YOU PUT THE SEAWEED
IN WITH THEM?

161
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,264
- YEAH.

162
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:58,899
PUT THE SEAWEED ON THE TOP
TO HOLD THE HEAT IN.

163
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:01,201
- RED LOBSTER DOESN'T COOK
THEM WITH SEAWEED.

164
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:02,836
- [chuckles]
- OH, MY GOD.

165
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:06,840
I'D SAY THOSE ARE DONE, NO?

166
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,576
- OH, MY GOD.

167
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,511
WHEN I WAS IN LABOR,
I FARTED IN THE DOCTOR'S FACE.

168
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,713
- DID YOU POOP?
- NO, I DIDN'T POOP.

169
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,382
I THOUGHT I HAD TO.
THAT'S WHAT LABOR--

170
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:15,616
- DOESN'T THAT HAPPEN, THOUGH?
- THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

171
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,451
IT FEELS LIKE YOU HAVE TO TAKE
A HUGE [bleep].

172
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,653
- HOW WERE YOU?
DID YOU FAINT?

173
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,254
- NO.
- [laughs]

174
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,723
- I SAW HER "PLUCENTA"
COME OUT.

175
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,024
- PLACENTA.

176
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,959
- WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT IS THE PLACENTA?

177
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,160
I THOUGHT THAT'S
THE LITTLE THING

178
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,195
THAT STICKS OUT
OF THEIR BELLY BUTTON.

179
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,763
- THAT'S THE UMBILICAL CORD.

180
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,064
- [laughs]
OH.

181
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,265
- PLACENTA IS WHAT
HE STAYS IN.

182
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,701
- THAT'S STILL ON HIM.
- RIGHT.

183
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,603
- PLACENTA IS DEEP INSIDE HER,
WHICH I WASN'T TOUCHING.

184
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:36,837
- DO YOU KNOW
SOME DADS EAT IT?

185
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:38,872
- EAT IT? NO, NO.
THEY--THEY EAT PLACENTA.

186
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,107
- OH.
- THEY--YEAH.

187
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,108
THEY PUT IT IN A MILKSHAKE.

188
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,511
- DID YOU?

189
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:44,745
- WHAT ARE YOU, SICK?
I COULDN'T LOOK AT IT.

190
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,279
- OH.

191
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:48,716
- TASTE IT?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

192
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:49,917
- YOU LOOK GOOD.

193
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,619
- I JUST CAN'T WAIT
TO GO TO THE GYM.

194
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,687
I HAVE TO WAIT
LIKE FIVE WEEKS, HE SAID.

195
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,055
- WHY, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
BREASTFEEDING?

196
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,158
- 'CAUSE IT'S STILL,
LIKE, RECOVERING.

197
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,527
AND I HAVE STITCHES
IN MY VAGINA.

198
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:02,062
- DO YOU FEEL NORMAL
DOWN THERE?

199
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,932
- I ACTUALLY LOOKED
IN THE MIRROR YESTERDAY,

200
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:05,933
LIKE, OPENED IT.

201
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,334
I BENT DOWN.

202
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:08,736
SHOULD'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

203
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:10,871
- WHY, WAS IT SCARY-LOOKING?
- I SAW THE STITCHES.

204
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,440
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY GROSS.

205
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:15,108
DON'T EVER LOOK TO SEE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AFTER.

206
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,444
- [laughs]
OKAY.

207
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,245
- YOU LOOKED AT IT?
- YEAH, I BENT OVER.

208
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:19,680
- OOF.
- I KNOW.

209
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,450
IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS,
LIKE, ANOTHER HOLE.

210
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,151
- LIKE WHERE THE PLACENTA WAS?

211
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,252
- I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST LOOKED LIKE

212
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,588
IT WAS TWO VAGINAS.

213
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:30,491
- I AIN'T LOOKING.
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOOK.

214
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:31,892
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU MADE HIM.

215
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:33,794
- IT'S A COOL FEELING.

216
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,929
- COOL.

217
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,230
- YAY.

218
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,832
- [laughing]
MONKEY, EVEN--

219
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,267
EVEN CAMEL TOE--

220
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,669
- I DON'T [bleep] THINK
I GET CAMEL TOE.

221
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,537
YOU'RE A [bleep],
AND YOU JUST SAY I DO.

222
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:44,672
SHUT UP.

223
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,373
- YOU'RE THE QUEEN
OF CAMEL TOE.

224
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:49,076
- YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY
WITH YOUR MOMMY, RIGHT?

225
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,478
JUST ME AND YOU?

226
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:52,245
- YOU LOVE MOMMY, RIGHT?

227
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,481
- THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE GETTING JEALOUS

228
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,483
THAT I'M GIVING
MY NEWBORN SON ATTENTION,

229
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,784
MORE ATTENTION THAN YOU--

230
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,351
- NO, I LOVE THAT YOU'RE
GIVING HIM ATTENTION.

231
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,153
- THAT'S FUNNY TOO.
- BUT YOU IGNORE ME.

232
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,990
KEEP TALKING TO HIM
SINCE HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.

233
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,895
- BYE.
- RAVIOLI.

234
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,708
- OH, YOU'RE SO CUTE!

235
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:21,709
IS HE YOURS?

236
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:24,377
- I DON'T THINK SO.

237
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:25,879
HE LOOKS NOTHING LIKE ME.

238
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:27,515
- OH, HE'S SO--

239
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,517
- LET'S SHOW LORENZO
HIS NEW ROOM.

240
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,586
- I'LL HOLD HIM.
- NO, BABE, I WANT TO. STOP.

241
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:41,361
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
YOUR NEW ROOM.

242
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,797
DOES IT MATTER
IF HIS EYES ARE CLOSED?

243
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,432
HE'LL GET THE POINT.
- HE'D HEAR US.

244
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:46,767
OKAY, LORENZO.

245
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:49,036
THIS IS...

246
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,037
YOUR--

247
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,105
- ARMOIRE.

248
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,941
I'M ALLOWED TO SPEAK TOO.

249
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,443
- YOU'RE GONNA HANG STUFF
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLD,

250
00:07:56,544 --> 00:07:57,778
AND, YOU KNOW, ALL YOUR--

251
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:01,549
- HE'S GONNA HANG IT?

252
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,050
- THIS IS WHERE
YOU'RE GONNA BE

253
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,919
TAKING ALL YOUR BATHS.

254
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,555
- YOU'RE GONNA BE
NICE AND CLEAN.

255
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,323
- SO YOU DON'T SMELL
LIKE YOUR MOMMY.

256
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:13,126
- YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.

257
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,195
- YOU WANT DADDY
TO HOLD YOU?

258
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,265
YOU WANT YOUR DAD
TO HOLD YOU?

259
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,967
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

260
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,334
IT'S ALL BETTER NOW.

261
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,871
YOU DON'T WANT TO STAY
WITH YOUR MOMMY, RIGHT?

262
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,138
JUST ME AND YOU?

263
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,574
- YOU LOVE MOMMY, RIGHT?

264
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,175
DADDY'S ANNOYING, RIGHT?

265
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,710
LET ME HAVE TIME
WITH LORENZO,

266
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,078
AND YOU CAN HAVE YOUR TIME.

267
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,580
KEEP TALKING TO HIM...

268
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,381
SINCE HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.

269
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,583
- THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE GETTING JEALOUS

270
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,484
THAT I'M GIVING
MY NEWBORN SON ATTENTION,

271
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:38,819
MORE ATTENTION THAN YOU--

272
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,654
- NO, I LOVE THAT
YOU'RE GIVING HIM ATTENTION.

273
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,255
- THAT'S FUNNY TOO.
- BUT YOU IGNORE ME.

274
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,224
AND THAT JUST BUGS ME OUT.

275
00:08:44,324 --> 00:08:47,127
- NICOLE, THE TOUR'S OVER.

276
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,629
ALL RIGHT, LORENZO.
- NO.

277
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:49,930
- AND THAT'S THE TOUR
OF YOUR BASEMENT.

278
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,832
- I WANT TO SHOW HIM--
- NOW LET'S GO TO BED.

279
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,366
- STOP.
- IT'S TIME FOR BED NOW.

280
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:54,735
- JIONNI, STOP IT.
- WE'RE GOING TO BED.

281
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,103
- OKAY, BUT GET SOME OF ME.

282
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:57,204
- WE'RE GOING TO BED.

283
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,606
- GET SOME OF ME
WITH HIM, PLEASE.

284
00:08:58,672 --> 00:08:59,940
- WE'RE GOING TO BED.

285
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,474
- LET'S SWAP.
COME ON.

286
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:02,710
- MOMMY'S THIS ANNOYING
ALL THE TIME.

287
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:03,944
- COME ON.

288
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,513
- SHE'S ALWAYS LIKE THIS.

289
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:09,049
- I KNEW MAYBE WE'D START
BICKERING A LITTLE BIT,

290
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,417
BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE
GET MARRIED,

291
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,085
THEY HAVE
THE GREATEST MARRIAGE,

292
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,054
LIKE, THE FIRST YEAR,
AND THEN THEY HAVE A KID.

293
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,790
THEN THEY WANT
TO GET DIVORCED.

294
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,158
HI, LORENZO.

295
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,693
- [sighs heavily]

296
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,328
- JIONNI, STOP IT.
- LET'S GO TO BED.

297
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,965
- YOU'RE SO RUDE.
STOP IT.

298
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,099
DADDY'S REALLY ANNOYING,

299
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:29,269
AND HE JUST RUINED
THIS WHOLE THING.

300
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,538
- NOW WE'RE TALKING.
EASY.

301
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,440
- YOU RUINED IT.
THANKS.

302
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,643
- [snickers]

303
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,344
NOT TO BE MEAN,
BUT I KINDA THINK IT'S FUNNY

304
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,047
'CAUSE, LIKE, SHE GETS SO MAD
OVER THE DUMBEST THINGS.

305
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:41,649
- OKAY, SO HE DOES IT
ON PURPOSE.

306
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,151
- IT'S NOT FIGHTING
FOR, LIKE, SERIOUS PROBLEMS.

307
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,486
- OKAY, BUT I REALLY GET
MY FEELINGS HURT.

308
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:49,790
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE A KOOK.

309
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,659
- THIS IS MY SIDE.

310
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,694
- OH, [bleep].

311
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,462
- I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO HUG YOU.

312
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:59,900
- SO GO ON THE OTHER SIDE.
- NO.

313
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,970
MOVE OVER.

314
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:09,710
- [groaning and laughing]

315
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,345
- [giggles]

316
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,182
I HOPE YOU SUFFOCATE.

317
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:20,821
- * I CAN FEEL IT

318
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,623
* I KNOW IT'S COMING ON

319
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,893
* I FEEL IT IN MY BLOOD

320
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:27,060
- CHEERS.

321
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,596
I HAD A GREAT THREE DAYS
UP HERE WITH YOU.

322
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,598
- ME TOO.
YOU GOT TO ACTUALLY SEE ME.

323
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,600
- AND YOU REALLY, HONESTLY
DID NOT COMPLAIN AT ALL.

324
00:10:33,701 --> 00:10:35,102
- NOPE.
- AND YOU DID IT ALL.

325
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,503
- YEP.

326
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:37,705
- YOU'VE DONE MORE
THAN SOME MAINE GIRLS HAVE DONE,

327
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:41,408
SO...I'M IMPRESSED.

328
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,643
- BETWEEN CLAMMING
AND FISHING

329
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,045
TO EATING BEAR BALLS,

330
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,646
I LOVED EVERY SINGLE PART.

331
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,115
- AND WE DID A LOT.
WE FIT A LOT IN.

332
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,083
IT WAS ONE OF MY BEST TRIPS
BACK TO MAINE

333
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:51,484
AND ONE OF MY MOST MEMORABLE.

334
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,153
- AW, MINE TOO.

335
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,222
- [grunts]

336
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,532
- YAY.

337
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,900
SLUMBER PARTY.

338
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,501
- [laughing]
MONKEY, EVEN--

339
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,503
EVEN CAMEL TOE WHEN YOU'RE
IN A ONESIE.

340
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,872
- SHUT UP.

341
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:14,975
- YOU'RE THE QUEEN
OF CAMEL TOE.

342
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,276
- I'M HIGH-HIPPED.

343
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,011
I DON'T [bleep] THINK
I GET CAMEL TOE.

344
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,880
YOU'RE A [bleep],
AND YOU JUST SAY I DO.

345
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,482
- YEAH, YOU DO.

346
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:25,618
- [laughing]
GO TO BED.

347
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,520
- GLAD YOU PUT UP
WITH MY JOKES.

348
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,223
- GLAD YOU PUT UP
WITH MY OVER-DRAMATIC-NESS.

349
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,591
- MM-HMM.

350
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,760
IN MAINE, IT'S NOT KNOWN
AS CAMEL TOE.

351
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:34,895
- WHAT'S IT CALLED?
- MOOSE KNUCKLE.

352
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:39,199
- [laughs]
EW.

353
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,633
I [bleep] HATE YOU.

354
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:44,404
- HEY, GUYS.

355
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:45,773
- OH, MY GOD.
- HI.

356
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,808
- YOU COULD PUT, LIKE,
PINS ON IT AND STUFF.

357
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,077
- THERE'S DADDY'S BUBBA.
OKAY, THERE HE IS!

358
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,512
MY BUBBA LOVES TO CHASE.

359
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,181
[dog yipping]

360
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,083
OH, HE PEED!
OH, MY--

361
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,051
- [laughing]
OH, MY GOD!

362
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,387
HE'S HIDING FROM YOU.

363
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,355
- HIS TAIL'S WAGGING.

364
00:12:05,893 --> 00:12:06,994
- LOOK AT YOU.
- NICE.

365
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,228
- LITTLE M.I.L.F.
- JUST HAD A BABY? REALLY?

366
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:10,363
- WHOA, YOU JUST HAD
A BABY?

367
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,532
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

368
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:13,600
- YOU GUYS
ARE JUST SAYING THAT.

369
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,802
- NO.

370
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,236
- SO TODAY, WE'RE GOING
TO BABYS"R"US.

371
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,938
I NEED A FEW BRAS
'CAUSE MY BOOBS ARE HUGE

372
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:18,972
FROM BREASTFEEDING.

373
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,108
- YOU NEED A PUMP BRA.

374
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,376
WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED?

375
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,012
WE HAVE A LIST.
- [bleep].

376
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:26,446
- IT'S YOU AND ME, KID.

377
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,615
- WE'LL BE BACK
IN LIKE AN HOUR.

378
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:33,153
- CIAO. HE'S WAVING GOOD-BYE.

379
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,922
- DO YOU MISS HIM ALREADY?

380
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,825
- YEAH.

381
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,329
"STORK PARKING.

382
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,498
EXPECTANT MOTHERS."

383
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,968
NICOLE WAS CLOSE ENOUGH
TO EXPECTING.

384
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,569
SHE ALREADY EXPECTED.

385
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:50,838
THERE WAS PLENTY
OF MORE SPACES

386
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,040
FOR OTHER PREGNANT MOTHERS.

387
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,607
- LET ME GET A CART.

388
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,976
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU PARKED THERE.

389
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,144
- OH.

390
00:12:57,244 --> 00:13:00,480
- WHO CARES?

391
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,315
CAN I LOOK
AT THESE BRAS REAL QUICK?

392
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,184
- YEAH.

393
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,752
DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

394
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:08,688
- MY BOOBS ARE HUGE.

395
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,925
UGH, THESE ARE NOT SEXY
AT ALL.

396
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,061
- SINCE NICOLE'S GIVEN BIRTH,
I'VE REALIZED

397
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,029
HER BOOBIES
ARE DOUBLE THE SIZE.

398
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,197
- UGH.
- THEY'RE BIG.

399
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:18,398
- I DON'T THINK...

400
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,766
- THEY FEEL GREAT.
- THAT'S A GREAT THING.

401
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:20,767
- WHY?

402
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,102
- BECAUSE THEY KILL ME,

403
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:24,737
AND THEY HURT SO BAD,
AND THEY'RE SO HEAVY.

404
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:25,873
OH, MY GOD,
THEY HURT SO BAD.

405
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,708
- EVERYBODY LIKES
BIG BOOBIES.

406
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,710
- WELL, AS FOR A GUY.

407
00:13:30,878 --> 00:13:32,145
FOR A GIRL,
AND YOU HAVE TO CARRY

408
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:33,346
THESE BIG KNOCKERS AROUND,

409
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:34,581
AND THEY'RE KILLING YOU
IN YOUR SLEEP,

410
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,283
NO.

411
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,317
- HI.

412
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,519
WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT, UM,

413
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,988
BREASTFEEDING.

414
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:44,324
- DO YOU HAVE ANY, LIKE,
HANDS-FREE STUFF?

415
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:45,792
LIKE, HE'S JUST SITTING THERE.

416
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:47,127
- AS FAR AS, LIKE, BREAST PUMPS?
- YEAH.

417
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,128
- YES.

418
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,362
THIS IS THE ONE

419
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:50,898
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE
YOUR HANDS.

420
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,966
YOU CAN USE THAT.

421
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,234
YOU JUST PUT THAT ON.

422
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,668
- AND IT STAYS?
- YEP, IT STAYS.

423
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,237
- [laughs]
- IT'S HANDS-FREE.

424
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,371
- YEAH, WE'LL DO THAT.

425
00:13:58,471 --> 00:13:59,539
- IF I WAS BREASTFEEDING,

426
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,108
I'D GET ONE
OF THESE BRAS MYSELF.

427
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,475
- MM-HMM, SO YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT

428
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:03,543
WHILE YOU'RE BREASTFEEDING.

429
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,246
- TEXT, TWITTER,
GO ON THE COMPUTER,

430
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,915
ORDER STUFF ON AMAZON.

431
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:10,951
- VACUUM.

432
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,355
- ALL RIGHT.
THINK WE'RE GOOD.

433
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:18,758
- I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY OUT
MY BREAST PUMP.

434
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:22,429
- * BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE
IN THE LIGHT *

435
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:23,763
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUT THERE.

436
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,833
- * SURROUNDED
BY EVERYTHING RIGHT *

437
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:28,801
- DEFINITELY BITTERSWEET THAT WE
HAVE TO GO BACK TO JERSEY.

438
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:32,039
EVERYTHING JUST WENT AS WELL
AS IT COULD POSSIBLY GO,

439
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,273
EXCEPT FOR SEX.

440
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,441
WOULD'VE SOMEHOW FACTORED SEX

441
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,076
INTO THAT EQUATION SOMEHOW.

442
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,510
READY?
- YEP.

443
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,678
- LET'S DO IT.

444
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:42,149
[sighs]

445
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,518
AND HERE WE GO,
BACK TO JERSEY.

446
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,786
I LOVE COMING UP HERE.

447
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,088
- IT WAS AMAZING.

448
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:49,856
CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK.

449
00:14:49,957 --> 00:14:52,525
- IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
COUPLE DAYS UP HERE.

450
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,395
YOU GOT THE MAINE STAMP
OF APPROVAL.

451
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,430
- AND I'M GLAD
I'M PART OF YOUR FAMILY.

452
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,966
IF ANYONE MET ROGER'S FAMILY,
THEY WOULD KNOW

453
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:01,368
THEY'RE SO NICE, SO SWEET,
AND SO COOL.

454
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:02,835
AND WHO WOULDN'T WANT TO BE
A PART OF THAT FAMILY?

455
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,972
- YOU JUST SEEMED TO REALLY
ENJOY YOUR TIME OUT THERE, SO--

456
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,406
- SO YOU SEE A FUTURE WITH ME?

457
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,774
- OF COURSE I DO.
- YAY.

458
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:10,810
- I WOULDN'T BE HERE THIS LONG
IF I DIDN'T.

459
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,549
- HOW DOES THIS WORK?

460
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,685
- [laughing]

461
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:23,523
- THIS IS A GOOD LOOK.

462
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:27,327
HEY, GUYS.

463
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,663
- OH, MY GOD.
- HI.

464
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,999
- I CAN MOVE AROUND.
- YEAH.

465
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,366
- PUT THE BACKPACK ON.
- YEAH.

466
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,534
- GO TO THE MALL.

467
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:35,868
- [laughs]
NO, I WOULDN'T--

468
00:15:36,003 --> 00:15:37,237
- GO OUT TO DINNER.
- WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.

469
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,705
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

470
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,307
- YOU COULD PUT, LIKE,
PINS ON IT AND STUFF.

471
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,341
- ALL RIGHT,
GO DO YOUR BUSINESS.

472
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,542
GO TAKE THAT THING OFF.

473
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,876
YOU BETTER NOT BE WEARING THAT
IN PUBLIC.

474
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,013
- HE DOESN'T LIKE IT.
- NO. NOT AT ALL.

475
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:48,648
- UNH-UH.

476
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,853
- [squeals]

477
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,290
- MOM?

478
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,026
SOMEONE'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

479
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,194
- HUH? WHAT?

480
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,662
I'M BUSY, BABE.

481
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,397
- YOU DON'T EVEN CARE
ABOUT YOUR SON.

482
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,932
- EXCUSE ME?

483
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,600
- ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT ME TO MAKE
YOU SOMETHING TO EAT?

484
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,302
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?
- NOTHING.

485
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,803
- THAT'S NOT EVEN
A FUNNY JOKE.

486
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:13,373
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO MAKE YOU SOMETHING?

487
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,908
WHAT'S NOT A FUNNY JOKE?
I WAS KIDDING.

488
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,044
- WHO SAYS THAT?

489
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:18,278
- SAID YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR SON.

490
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,712
- WHAT?
- RELAX.

491
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,680
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE YOU
SOMETHING?

492
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,881
- WHAT? WHAT'D YOU SAY?

493
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,450
- [sighs]
RELAX.

494
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,285
WANT ME TO MAKE YOU SOMETHING?
- NO, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

495
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,453
WHO SAYS THAT?

496
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:27,754
THAT WAS ANNOYING!

497
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,122
- GET US A THERAPIST,
PLEASE.

498
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:31,191
- NO! JIONNI, NO.

499
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,325
THAT'S FOR WEIRD PEOPLE.

500
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,660
- OH, WHAT,
YOU THINK I'D GO ANYWAY?

501
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,295
- UGH.

502
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,164
- CAN YOU GO RELAX, PLEASE?

503
00:16:37,264 --> 00:16:39,566
WE'RE NOT HAVING
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS.

504
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,534
- FEELS LIKE IT.
- NO, IT DON'T.

505
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:42,735
THAT'S WHY
I'M PROBABLY LAUGHING,

506
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,371
BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY.

507
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,139
TO ME, IT'S FUNNY.

508
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,708
- I'M NOT LAUGHING.
- I THINK IT'S FUNNY.

509
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,581
- SO IS IT ALL RIGHT IF I LEAVE,
OR DO YOU NEED ME

510
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,983
TO STICK AROUND TO HELP
WITH SOMETHING ELSE?

511
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,086
- WE'RE GOOD.
- JIONNI'LL BE HOME--

512
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,453
YOU'LL BE HOME FOR THE BABY?

513
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:02,589
- YEAH, I'M NOT GOING
WITH HER TO DO HER NAILS.

514
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,291
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

515
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:07,094
- I'M NERVOUS LEAVING LORENZO
HOME WITH JIONNI

516
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,195
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

517
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:09,196

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,809
- I DID IT--
I DON'T WANT TO.

695
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,010
- YOU JUST SAID--

696
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,479
- 'CAUSE YOU PUSHED ME,
LIKE THIS.

697
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:33,613
LIKE, IT'S ANNOYING.

698
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,147
IT'S NOT FUNNY ANYMORE.
- [snickers]

699
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,483
- I'M NOT FUN--
I'M NOT LAUGHING.

700
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,218
- RELAX, DUDE.
HOLY [bleep].

701
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:49,061
GOOD NIGHT.
LOVE YOU.

702
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,897
- JIONNI.

703
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,098
- WHAT?

704
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,365
WHAT?

705
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,334
- YOU'RE, LIKE, SMOTHERING HIM.
- I LOVE HIM.

706
00:23:55,502 --> 00:23:57,369
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAID YOU LOVED ME?

707
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:58,505
- [laughs]

708
00:23:58,571 --> 00:23:59,906
- IT'S JUST THREE WORDS.

709
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:02,008
WHY CAN'T YOU SAY IT
MORE OFTEN, MAN?

710
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,811
- [laughing]
BECAUSE.

711
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,879
BECAUSE LORENZO'S
ON MY MIND,

712
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:08,147
AND IT JUST--I'M--

713
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:09,882
HE'S MY FIRST PRIORITY
RIGHT NOW.

714
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,117
- I SAID I LOVE YOU
AT THE NAIL SALON,

715
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,251
AND YOU JUST HUNG UP.

716
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:13,620
- I DIDN'T HEAR. YOU DID?
- YEAH.

717
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,587
- NO.
- I SAID, "I LOVE YOU, BYE."

718
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,022
YOU SAID, "BYE."

719
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,525
- NO, I WAS FEEDING HIM.

720
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,359
I STILL LOVE YOU,
OBVIOUSLY.

721
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:22,394
- I WISH WE SAID IT MORE.

722
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,631
- ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL START TONIGHT.

723
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:26,298
- LOVE YOU.

724
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,667
LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU.

725
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,101
- SEE, HE SAYS IT LIKE THAT.

726
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:30,537
- I LOVE YOU.

727
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,338
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

728
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,406
[smooching]

729
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,546
- OH, DIESEL.

730
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,781
YOU NEED TO GO
TO A VET IMMEDIATELY.

731
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,249
- WELL, WHY--HOW COME
YOU COULDN'T WATCH HIM THEN?

732
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,984
- I WATCH HIM
THE BEST I CAN, ALL RIGHT?

733
00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,553
- NO, YOU DIDN'T WATCH HIM
THE BEST YOU CAN, JENNI.

734
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:47,687
- AT THE TIME, I DID.

735
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:50,456
I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK
HE WAS EATING IT.

736
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:52,324
- KATIE!

737
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:54,994
KATIE, MY BEST FRIEND FOREVER,
FROM HIGH SCHOOL...

738
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:56,796
DON'T CRY.
OH, MY GOD.

739
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,798
SHE GAVE ME
THE NICKNAME SNOOKI.

740
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:01,668
SO IT'S ALL HER [bleep] FAULT.

741
00:25:01,768 --> 00:25:03,002
- ISN'T HE CUTE?

742
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:05,004
- HE'S SO CUTE.
- I HATE YOU.

743
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,845
- * HEART ATTACKERS
AND RUNAWAYS *

744
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,080
* TICKET TAKERS
GONNA MAKE YOU PAY *

745
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,983
- YOU NEED TO GO
OUTSIDE, OKAY?

746
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:18,117
ROGER!

747
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,987
- WHAT?
- DO YOU WANT SOME SALAD?

748
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:23,022
- I'M OKAY.
THANK YOU.

749
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,491
THANKS FOR YELLING UP HERE.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

750
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:28,595
[light groovy music]

751
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,597
*

752
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:32,632
- DON'T BE EATING GRASS,
DIESEL.

753
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,233
I FEEL LIKE DOGS
ARE LIKE HAVING KIDS.

754
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,635
YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE A BIG RESPONSIBILITY.

755
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,770
WHEN THEY GET SICK,
YOU TAKE THEM TO THE VET.

756
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,171
WHEN THEY NEED LOVE,
YOU GIVE THEM LOVE.

757
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,640
WHEN THEY'RE HUNGRY,
YOU FEED THEM.

758
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,274
YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY NEED
ATTENTION,

759
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,344
YOU PLAY WITH THEM.

760
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:48,648
STOP IT.

761
00:25:48,748 --> 00:25:51,017
I'M GONNA MAKE A BIG SALAD.

762
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:53,319
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
STAY OUT HERE?

763
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,754
IF I HAD KIDS
AND MY DOGS,

764
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:57,223
I WOULD DEFINITELY GET A MAID
AND/OR A NANNY.

765
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:01,160
'CAUSE I WOULD NEED HELP.

766
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,962
OH, DIESEL.
[sighs]

767
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,497
THERE GOES EATING.

768
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:06,899
BABE!

769
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,100
- WHAT?

770
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,636
- DIESEL'S THROWING UP
ALL OVER AGAIN.

771
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:11,237
- WAS HE OUTSIDE?
- YEAH, HE WAS OUTSIDE.

772
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:12,504
BUT I WAS WATCHING HIM.

773
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:15,041
DIESEL, WHAT ARE YOU EATING
OUT THERE?

774
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,308
- I KNOW YOU WERE OUT THERE
WITH HIM,

775
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,810
BUT YOU--WERE YOU WATCHING HIM
THE ENTIRE TIME?

776
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,045
HE NEVER GOT
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT?

777
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:21,013
- HE WAS JUST, LIKE--
- BUT DID YOU WATCH HIM?

778
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,314
YOU WEREN'T, LIKE,
TEXTING ON YOUR PHONE

779
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,415
OR NOTHING LIKE THAT?

780
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:24,383
- I WAS EATING
AND WATCHING HIM, BUT--

781
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,818
- I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

782
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,987
IT'S, LIKE,
GRASS SEED AND FERTILIZER.

783
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,488
AND I THINK
THAT'S WHAT HE'S EATING.

784
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,724
- I'M TRYING TO WATCH DIESEL.

785
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,793
I TREAT ALL MY BABIES
LIKE THEY ARE MY BABIES.

786
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:34,894
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST--

787
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:36,095
IT'S LIKE A KID.

788
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:37,463
LIKE, IF MY KID WANTS
TO PLAY OUTSIDE,

789
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:38,698
I'M GONNA LET HIM
PLAY OUTSIDE.

790
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:40,199
I'M NOT GONNA BE LIKE...

791
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,769
AND [bleep] STARE AT HIM
FOR 24/7.

792
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,070
I'M GONNA LET HIM
DO HIS THING,

793
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,237
COME BACK WHEN HE'S READY.

794
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,040
WELL, IT'S SAYING...

795
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,275
A DOG WITH THESE SIGNS,

796
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:50,877
YOU NEED TO GO
TO A VET IMMEDIATELY.

797
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,544
- OKAY, WOULD YOU LIKE
TO RUN HIM

798
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,146
TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM
RIGHT NOW THEN?

799
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,347
- I DON'T KNOW,
AT THIS POINT.

800
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,415
THIS IS DRIVING ME NUTS.
LOOK AT HIM.

801
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,583
- OKAY, WELL, WHY--

802
00:26:57,684 --> 00:26:58,885
HOW COME YOU COULDN'T
WATCH HIM THEN?

803
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:00,419
- I WATCH HIM
THE BEST I CAN, ALL RIGHT?

804
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,888
- NO, YOU DIDN'T WATCH HIM
THE BEST YOU CAN, JENNI.

805
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:03,122
- AT THE TIME, I DID.

806
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,891
I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK
HE WAS EATING IT

807
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:06,959
OR GETTING INTO IT
WHEN HE WAS WALKING AROUND.

808
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,560
ROGER DOESN'T LIKE
TO DROP ANYTHING,

809
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,029
SO EVEN THOUGH I ADMIT
TO ROGER

810
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:14,200
THAT I WASN'T WATCHING HIM
LIKE A HAWK OUTSIDE,

811
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,568
ROGER STILL WANTS TO DIG

812
00:27:16,703 --> 00:27:18,404
HIS LITTLE [bleep] HOLES
IN MY SIDE

813
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:19,605
AND, YOU KNOW,
BITCH AT ME.

814
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:21,073
- IS YOUR STATEMENT
RIGHT NOW

815
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,709
THAT YOU ARE NOT CAPABLE

816
00:27:22,775 --> 00:27:24,410
OF WATCHING THAT DOG...

817
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,511
- I'M GOING TO TRY, BUT--

818
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:27,379
- FOR FIVE OR TEN MINUTES
TO A TIME?

819
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,416
'CAUSE IF THE DOG GOES,
I'M GOING.

820
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:38,390
[birds chirping]

821
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,826
- NOT TOO MUCH SALT.
- DON'T LOOK.

822
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:41,627
- OKAY--WHOA.

823
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:44,496
OH, GOD.

824
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:45,965
- JUST LEAVE MY RECIPE ALONE.

825
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:48,067
- NO, I'M JUST GONNA
JUST LOCK THINGS UP.

826
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,737
YOU CAN'T USE THAT.
YOU CAN'T USE THAT.

827
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,604
- STEP ASIDE.
- OKAY.

828
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:55,107
- I AM MAKING MY SPECIALTY,

829
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,043
SEAFOOD PASTA.

830
00:27:57,143 --> 00:28:01,247
THE SPOON ITSELF WILL GIVE IT
SOME SEAFOOD FLAVOR.

831
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:02,448
IT'S MY FAVORITE.

832
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:03,649
I'M GONNA SHOW MY MOTHER
I CAN COOK.

833
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,051
GET OUT--JUST GO.
GET OUTTA HERE.

834
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:06,585
- WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE
THREE CLAMS ARE GONNA DO?

835
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:08,187
- THERE'S FOUR CLAMS.
NOW GET OVER THERE.

836
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:09,455
I SOMEWHAT KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

837
00:28:09,555 --> 00:28:10,857
I KNOW WHAT I NEED.
I KNOW THE FLAVOR.

838
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:12,024
I KNOW THE TIME.

839
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,159
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO THIS
ON MY OWN.

840
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,828
- DADDY THINKS HE CAN COOK.

841
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,765
BUT HE CAN'T.

842
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:21,768
- PLEASE, HUH?

843
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:28,307
- DO YOU HATE ME?

844
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,550
ME AND ROGER
DEFINITELY FIGHT DIFFERENTLY

845
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,786
THAN WE USED TO.

846
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,388
WE SEPARATE OURSELVES,
COOL OFF,

847
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:43,823
AND THEN COMMUNICATE,

848
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:46,492
RATHER THAN SCREAMING MATCHES,
NOT TALKING FOR DAYS,

849
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:50,963
PUNCHING EACH OTHER,
[bleep] LIKE THAT.

850
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:52,464
[sighs]

851
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,665
HI, HANDSOME.

852
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,804
HELLO, HANDSOME MAN.

853
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,005
- PLEASE, JUST IN THE FUTURE,

854
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,706
JUST KEEP AN EYE ON HIM,
LIKE, THE ENTIRE TIME.

855
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,174
- WELL, NOW I'M PARANOID
WITH ALL THREE OF THEM.

856
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,275
- OR CALL ME.

857
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:05,077
- I SAW [bleep] NOEL
SNIFFING AROUND.

858
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:06,813
- JUST SAYING,
KEEP AN EYE ON ALL THE DOGS

859
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:07,980
WHILE THEY'RE OUT HERE.

860
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,115
THAT'S THE EASIEST WAY
TO DO IT.

861
00:29:09,215 --> 00:29:10,649
LIKE, A CONSTANT EYE.

862
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:11,717
I'M FRUSTRATED,

863
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:13,920
MORE BECAUSE JENNI KNOWS

864
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,387
HOW MUCH I LOVE DIESEL,

865
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,722
AND, YOU KNOW,
JUST KEEP AN EYE ON HIM

866

00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,346
TILL SHE'S 40 YEARS OLD.

1041
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,513
- HE'S ACTUALLY--
- HE GOT HAIRY LITTLE ARMS.

1042
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:42,881
- I WAS EXPECTING HAIRIER.

1043
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:44,483
- "HE'S SO CUTE.

1044
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,152
I MIGHT WANT ONE."

1045
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,253
- I DON'T THINK SO.

1046
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:48,654
- AND THAT IS A PANTS-POOPER
FOR RON.

1047
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,989
- HE'S NOT THAT HAIRY.

1048
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,158
IT'S OKAY, BABY.

1049
00:34:52,258 --> 00:34:53,292
- HE MIGHT WANT A BUB, SO--

1050
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:54,926
- WHAT'S A--
OH, A BOOB.

1051
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,295

- A BUB. YOU SAID A BUB?

1052
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:58,063

1053
00:34:58,164 --> 00:34:59,198

YEAH.

1054
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:00,766
- [coos]
- OH, MY GOD.

1055
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,334
HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

1056
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,636
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS YOUR BABY.

1057
00:35:04,736 --> 00:35:05,837
- MM-HMM.

1058
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,072
- HE JUST HAS HAIRY--
LIKE, A HAIRY HEAD.

1059
00:35:07,173 --> 00:35:08,174
THAT'S IT.
- YEAH, HE DOES.

1060
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:09,308
- YOU GUYS SHOULD HAVE ONE.

1061
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:12,211
- HELL, NO.

1062
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,513
IN LIKE TEN YEARS.
TEN YEARS.

1063
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:15,881
- TEN YEARS? YOU'LL BE 40.

1064
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,850
- LORENZO CAN BABYSIT OUR KIDS
IN LIKE TEN YEARS.

1065
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,085
- [laughs]

1066
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:21,187
- SO YOU HAVE TO GO BACK

1067
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,354
AND GET THE STITCHES OUT,
NICOLE?

1068
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,089
- NO, THEY DISSOLVE.
THEY DISSOLVE.

1069
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,192
- YOU GOT AN EPISIOTOMY?
- NO, THEY DIDN'T CUT IT.

1070
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:27,726
I JUST RIPPED A LITTLE BIT.

1071
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,195
- WHAT'D YOU SAY?

1072
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:30,929
- [hisses]

1073
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:32,198
- I RIPPED.

1074
00:35:32,231 --> 00:35:33,832
- [shudders]

1075
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,234
- WELL, USUALLY,
WHEN YOU GIVE BIRTH,

1076
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:36,702
YOUR VAGINA RIPS
BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE

1077
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,969
ANYTHING THAT BIG IN YOU,

1078
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,838
UNLESS YOU'RE, LIKE,
A RAGING WHORE.

1079
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:42,073
- POOR VAGINA
GOES THROUGH SO MUCH.

00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,609
IT'S LIKE--
[laughs]

1081
00:35:43,709 --> 00:35:46,745
- IT'S DEFINITELY [bleep] UP.

1082
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,280
- ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT IS
YOUR THROBBING VAGINA.

1083
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,481
- UGH, IT'S NOT THROBBING.

1084
00:35:49,581 --> 00:35:51,717
FEELS LIKE I HAD SEX
FOR TEN HOURS.

1085
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:52,951
- UGH!

- I'M MAKING
HOMEMADE MOZZARELLA.

1089
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,358

- RONNIE HOLDING LORENZO,

1098
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:17,743
RONNIE LOOKS LIKE AN UNCLE,

1099
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:20,979
AND, YOU KNOW,
THEY LOOK RELATED, KIND OF.

1100
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,113

1104
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:26,552
HALF ITALIAN,
HALF SPANISH.

1105
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:28,254
- YEAH, A LITTLE "CHUIDO".

1106
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,755
LITTLE CHILEAN GUIDO.

1107
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:30,822
[chuckles]

1159
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,677
- WHY'S HE SO RED?

1160
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,546
- WHEN HE GETS EXCITED,
HE GETS RED.

1161
00:38:00,646 --> 00:38:02,147
- GO EAT.

1162
00:38:02,348 --> 00:38:03,782
- I WANT TO CUDDLE.

1163
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:05,050

1164
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,353

1165
00:38:07,419 --> 00:38:09,621
- [laughs]

1166
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:11,957
- I KEEP GETTING HER MAD
BY, LIKE,

1167
00:38:12,057 --> 00:38:14,025
PUSHING HER OUT OF THE WAY
WHEN WE'RE HOLDING HIM.

1168
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,461
- I WOULD TOO.

1169
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,595
I KEEP TELLING HER,
I WAS LIKE,

1170
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:18,797
JIONNI'S GONNA RUN AWAY
WITH LORENZO.

1171
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:20,231
- OH, YES.
- HE DOESN'T LIKE ME ANYMORE.

1172
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:21,633
- LEAVE MOMMY AT HOME.
- I SAY IT ALL THE TIME.

1173
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:22,834
- [snickers]

1174
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:24,035
- HE SAYS,
"IT JUST ME AND LORENZO.

1175
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,236
I DON'T NEED YOU."

1176
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:26,472
- NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
WHAT DO I SAY?

1177
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:27,506
- BASICALLY, YOU SAY THAT.

1178
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:28,874
- I DON'T--
WHAT DO I SAY?

1179
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,042
EXACT WORDS.
I DON'T SAY THAT.

1180
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,177
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?
I DON'T KNOW.

1181
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:33,512
- CAN YOU GUYS
JUST GET MARRIED ALREADY?

1182
00:38:33,612 --> 00:38:35,547
UGH, LISTEN TO YOU.
- HE DOESN'T WANT TO.

1183
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,215
ME AND JIONNI
HAVE BEEN BICKERING

1184
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:39,117
EVER SINCE LORENZO
WAS BORN,

1185
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:41,119
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.

1186
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:42,388
- [sighs]

1187
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:44,723
YOU WANNA LAY DOWN
A LITTLE BIT?

1188
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,093
YOU WANNA CUDDLE
WITH DADDY?

1189
00:38:48,193 --> 00:38:49,294
WE'RE DEFINITELY TIRED.

1190
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:51,397
IT'S TIME TO GO TO BED.
I'M EXHAUSTED.

1191
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:52,698
LORENZO'S EXHAUSTED.

1192
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:54,466
LET'S HIT THE MAN CAVE.

1193
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:56,502
- BYE, BOO.

1194
00:38:56,602 --> 00:38:58,604
- BYE, AUNT KATIE.

1195
00:38:58,704 --> 00:38:59,838
WHAT ABOUT ME?

1196
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:01,239
SEE? HE LEFT ME OUT.
DID YOU SEE THAT?

1197
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:02,608
- I FORGOT.
- "I'M EXHAUSTED.

1198
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:03,742
LORENZO'S EXHAUSTED."

1199
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:07,212
I'M NOT IN THE PICTURE.

1200
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:10,281
- GOOD NIGHT, BUDDY.

1201
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:14,486
GOOD NIGHT, BUDDY.

1202
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,821
GOOD NIGHT,
MY "WITTLE" BUDDY.

1203
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:17,122
[grunts]

1204
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:18,590
- [giggles]

1205
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:19,858
- ARE YOU SICK?

1206
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:20,926
GET OFF ME.

1207
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,461
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1208
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:27,098
- YOU'RE--

1209
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,568
YOU'RE JUST MESSED UP.

1210
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:31,069
- I'M SO EXCITED.

1211
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:32,804
I FEEL LIKE I FEEL
SEXY AGAIN,

1212
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,874
AND HE DOESN'T GIVE A [bleep].

1213
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:40,646
[scoffs]

1214
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:43,181
THIS IS BULL[bleep].

1215
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:44,950
- I'M OVER HERE.

1216
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,452
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO TO ME.

1217
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:47,953
IF I DON'T LOOK
AT YOU, YOU--

1218
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,856
- 'CAUSE YOU NEVER LOOK
AT ME ANYMORE.

1219
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,891
- OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO TIRED.

1220
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,025
- YOU DIDN'T KISS ME.

1221
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,461
- WHAT A LONG NIGHT.

1222
00:39:55,494 --> 00:39:56,495
- [hiccups]

1223
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,464
- [gasps]
HE HAS THE HICCUPS.

1224
00:39:58,497 --> 00:39:59,531
- I DON'T DELIBERATELY
IGNORE YOU.

1225
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:01,933
I JUST AM PAYING
A LOT OF ATTENTION TO HIM,

1226
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,169
AND YOU'RE NOT USED TO IT.

1227
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,571
TALK TO HIM.

1228
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:08,073
- YOU JUST TOLD ME
TO TALK TO YOU.

1229
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,240
- GET THAT OFF HIS FACE.

1230
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,742
- RELAX.

1231
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,110
OKAY, BUT I WANT
SOME LOVIN' TOO.

1232
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,779
LIKE, WHEN HE GOES TO SLEEP,
HUG ME.

1233
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:14,946
- I DO.

1234
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,114
EVERY NIGHT,
WE CUDDLE BEFORE BED.

1235
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:17,315
- WE DON'T CUDDLE ANYMORE.

1236
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,684
- I PUT MY ARM AROUND YOU
AND GIVE YOU--

1237
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:20,185
AND GO TO BED.

1238
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:21,352
- NO, YOU--
- CALL ME A LIAR.

1239
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:24,255
- YOU SLEEP OVER HERE.
I SLEEP OVER HERE.

1240
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,291
- IT SMELLS LIKE THROW-UP
IN HERE.

1241
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:31,597
- YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE NOT
IN A GOOD MOOD.

1242
00:40:31,697 --> 00:40:33,131
- IT HAS TO DO
WITH YOU MEETING MY MOTHER.

1243
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,766
I HAVEN'T INTRODUCED
HARDLY ANYONE TO MY MOM,

1244
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,001
LET ALONE A BOYFRIEND.

1245
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,669
- DO YOU THINK THERE WILL
EVER BE A POINT

1246
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,170
WHERE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
WITH ME MEETING HER,

1247
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,205
OR NO?

1248
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,608
[fire alarm beeps]
- [screams]

1249
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:44,109
- [crying]
- I HATE YOU.

1250
00:40:44,209 --> 00:40:46,478
- WE'RE NOT WORKING.
- NO, WE'RE NOT.

1251
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:47,913
- START PACKING YOUR [bleep].

1252
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:49,915
- A BABY CHANGES
THE RELATIONSHIP,

1253
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,683
SO ME AND JIONNI
JUST NEED TO WORK ON IT.

1254
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,084
- I WAS INTERESTED
IN SPEAKING

1255
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,653
TO SOMEBODY
ABOUT ENGAGEMENT RINGS.

1256
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:56,488
MY HEART TELLS ME
THAT SHE'S THE ONE FOR ME.

1257
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:57,856
- YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING,
DID YOU?

1258
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,491
- YEAH. WHAT?
- WHAT?

1259
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:00,792
- HEAR ABOUT WHAT?
