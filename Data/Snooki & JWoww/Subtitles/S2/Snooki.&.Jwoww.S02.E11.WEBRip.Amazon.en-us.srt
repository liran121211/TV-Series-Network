00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:07,700
I'M STILL, LIKE,
LAYING IN BED.

174
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,133
- I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU SO DRUNK
IN MY LIFE. I LOST IT.

175
00:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,700
- DID YOU GUYS HAVE FUN?

176
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,367
- I HAD A [bleep] AMAZING TIME,
FROM WHAT I REMEMBER.

177
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,633
- I'M GLAD THAT I'M NOT
THE ONLY ASS[bleep]

178
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,500
THAT GOT WASTED
LAST NIGHT.

179
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,900
- NICOLE'S GOT BRUISES
ON HER KNEES,

180
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,900
AND SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHY.

181
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,900
- [laughs]

182
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,767
- I THINK SHE FELL.

183
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,967
- WE WERE ALL REALLY DRUNK.

184
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,633
WELL, FEEL BETTER, POOP.
- BYE, GUYS.

185
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:33,433
- WHAT?
HE'S NOT GONNA FART.

186
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:35,067
YOU WANT TO TEST
MY BREAST MILK?

187
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,333
- NO!

188
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,200
- IT'S PROBABLY LIKE--
- PURE VODKA?

189
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
- VODKA.
- DID YOU PUMP?

190
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,267
- YEAH.
- DUMP THAT [bleep].

191
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:43,700
- LAST TIME I DRANK
AND I TESTED MY MILK,

192
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,433
IT DIDN'T SAY IT
WAS NEGATIVE

193
00:07:45,433 --> 00:07:47,500
JUST BECAUSE I HAD, LIKE,
TWO GLASSES OF WINE.

194
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,233
BUT LAST NIGHT, I HAD PROBABLY
THREE BOTTLES OF VODKA,

195
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:54,500
SO I KNOW THIS MILK IS GONNA BE
GROSSLY CONTAMINATED.

196
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,833
IT'S LIKE A PREGNANCY TEST.

197
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:02,467
IF IT TURNS BROWN,
IT'S CONTAMINATED.

198
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:05,400
OH, IT'S TURNING BROWN.
- LET ME SEE.

199
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:10,467
- OH, YEAH,
IT'S CONTAMINATED.

200
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,600
- IT'S, LIKE, TOXIC.

201
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,867
- YEAH.
LIKE IT'LL BURN YOUR SKIN.

202
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:17,700
- LET ME SMELL IT.
- MY MILK?

203
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,567
[groans]

204
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,433
- WHAT?
- IT SMELLS.

205
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:22,867
- THIS STUFF'S GOTTA HAVE

206
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,400
EVERY DIFFERENT LIQUOR
IN THE WORLD IN IT--

207
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,700
SHOTS, WINE,
VODKA, TEQUILA.

208
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,267
- DO YOU THINK IF YOU DRANK
THIS, YOU WOULD GET DRUNK?

209
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:31,567
- IF I DRANK
NICOLE'S BREAST MILK RIGHT NOW,

210
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:33,200
I'D PROBABLY BLACK OUT.

211
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,333
YAY!
- SEE YA.

212
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,867
OH, [bleep].
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

213
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:39,400
- WANT TO TAKE A SHOT?
- NO!

214
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,100
- JUST ONE.
- NO.

215
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:43,167
- I'M GETTING PAINTED
LIKE THIS BAD GUY.

216
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,567
- NOBODY--
YOU'RE PAINTING YOURSELF.

217
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,067
LIKE,
NOBODY'S DOING ANYTHING.

218
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,067
- OKAY. PROBLEM SOLVED.
[door slams]

219
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:50,100
- AND THERE HE GOES.

220
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,567
- AH!
[laughs]

221
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:54,500
- THIS KID IS STRONG.
HE'S LIKE AN OX.

222
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,667
- OW! BABE!
[laughs]

223
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,433
[rock music]

224
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:02,467
- *A BALL OF CLOUDS *

225
00:09:02,467 --> 00:09:05,867
* THEY'LL ONLY
LEAD YOU DOWN *

226
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:07,067
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?

227
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:09,100
- OH, GOD, I CAN'T
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU.

228
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,200
- I DID THE SAME EXACT THING
LAST WEEKEND.

229
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,600
- WE MIXED [bleep] SAKE BOMBS
WITH WINE...

230
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
- I DID PATRON.
- SANGRIA, CHAMPAGNE, VODKA.

231
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,067
IT'S LIKE,
IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE.

232
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,267
IT FEELS LIKE
I'M GONNA BARF.

233
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:24,500
BUT MY STOMACH'S SAYING,
"I'M HUNGRY,"

234
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,400
BUT RIGHT HERE, IT'S SAYING,
"[bleep] YOU, I'LL THROW UP."

235
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,667
- I FELT THE SAME WAY.

236
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:30,533
- AND I HAVE A HEADACHE.

237
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:33,067
IT WAS JUST
ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS.

238
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:35,733
A NIGHT THAT I WILL NEVER
HAVE AGAIN THE REST OF MY LIFE

239
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:37,867
BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE
WHAT I FEEL LIKE TODAY.

240
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:39,700
- BABE, YOU CAN GO
AS HARD AS YOU WANT.

241
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,900
YOU KNOW I DON'T CARE.

242
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,967
IT'S JUST, YOU MADE PLANS
TO DO SOMETHING

243
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:45,800
AT, LIKE, 1:00 TODAY,
AND IT'S ALMOST 4:00 NOW.

244
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,867
- I'M READY. I'M RIGHT HERE.
LET'S GO.

245
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:51,100
- YOU JUST GOT DOWN HERE,
SO LET'S NOT ACT LIKE

246
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,733
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING HERE,
WAITING ON ME.

247
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,233
- OH, I KNOW, BUT YOU--

248
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,200
I TOLD YOU YOU COULD HAVE DID
WHATEVER YOU WANTED TODAY.

249
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,533
- YOU DID NOT TELL ME THAT.

250
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:58,967
YOU SAID WE'RE GOING
TO BLACKBEARD'S CAVE.

251
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:01,433
- I UNDERSTAND, BUT DON'T
MAKE IT BE, LIKE, MY FAULT.

252
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,900
[dogs barking]

253
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,267
IT'S NOT.

254
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:07,767
- DON'T MAKE WHAT
YOUR FAULT?

255
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:09,800
THE FACT THAT YOU MADE PLANS
WITH ME YESTERDAY

256
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,433
TO DO SOMETHING TODAY,
AND IT'S NOW 4:00?

257
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:15,133
- IT'S NOW 4:00 ONLY BECAUSE
WE COULDN'T GO TO BLACKBEARD'S,

258
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,567
AND I TOLD YOU TO GO--

259
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:18,033
- YOU'RE DOING
THE SPIN THING YOU DO.

260
00:10:18,033 --> 00:10:19,500
- YOU ARE.
- NO, YOU ARE.

261
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,467
- I'M HANGING OUT.
I'M READY TO GO WHEN YOU ARE.

262
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,767
I'M TRYING TO DO THE BEST I CAN
DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

263
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,133
- I'M JUST SAYING,
YOU'RE GETTING THIS 'TUDE,

264
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:28,267
LIKE, "DON'T BLAME ME.
NOTHING'S EVER MY FAULT."

265
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:29,767
YOU'RE GIVING ME
THIS 'TUDE RIGHT NOW.

266
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,000
"DON'T BLAME ME.
NOTHING'S EVER--"

267
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,133
- YOU'RE GIVING ME ATTITUDE.

268
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,400
- I MEAN, DON'T COME AT ME

269
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,767
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING
ALL DAY, JENNI.

270
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,200
I'M THE ONE
THAT'S BEEN PATIENTLY

271
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,033
SITTING AROUND,
WAITING FOR YOU.

272
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:40,033
I'M GETTING PAINTED
LIKE THIS BAD GUY.

273
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:41,433
- NOBODY--
YOU'RE PAINTING YOURSELF.

274
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,067
LIKE,
NOBODY'S DOING ANYTHING.

275
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:47,000
- OKAY. PROBLEM SOLVED.
- LET'S GO.

276
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,800
- NO. I'M GONNA GO DO
SOMETHING WITH MAX.

277
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,433
I'VE JUST REACHED MY LIMIT.

278
00:10:50,433 --> 00:10:52,167
I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT.
I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE.

279
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,967
THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO
IS JUST LEAVE, AND, YOU KNOW,

280
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,500
THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE.

281
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,200
- DO YOU WANT TO JUST GO?

282
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,300
- NO, I'D LIKE YOU
TO ADMIT FOR ONCE

283
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,067
THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU JUST DON'T
PUT EVERYTHING ON ME.

284
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,233
YOU'LL NEVER DO THAT.

285
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,567
- I'M NOT PUTTING ANYTHING
ON YOU.

286
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,833
[door slams]
AND THERE HE GOES.

287
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,067
BACK TO LAY DOWN.
SORRY, BOOGER BUTTS.

288
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:13,067
MOMMY NEEDS TO LAY DOWN.

289
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:16,300
[groans]

290
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,100
SOMEONE BRING ME ICE CREAM.

291
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,200
[upbeat music]

292
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,233
**

293
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:30,367
- SO I WAS THINKING, SINCE I'M,
LIKE, A REALLY GOOD FRIEND,

294
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:33,900
I WANT TO THROW JENNI
AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY HERE.

295
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,267
- IS IT A SURPRISE,

296
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:36,733
OR IT'S, LIKE, GONNA BE
AN ENGAGEMENT PARTY?

297
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:39,067
- A SURPRISE!

298
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:40,767
I WANT TO CELEBRATE
AND BE, LIKE,

299
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:41,967
YOU KNOW,
"HAPPY ENGAGEMENT,"

300
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:44,100
AND I FEEL LIKE
SHE DESERVES IT

301
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,400
BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN WAITING
TO BE ENGAGED FOREVER.

302
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,767
AND I'M THINKING I TELL HER
IT'S, LIKE, A PARTY FOR LORENZO,

303
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:52,833
FOR EVERYONE TO COME
AND MEET LORENZO,

304
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,767
BUT REALLY,
IT'S THEIR ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

305
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,367
I LOVE SURPRISE PARTIES!

306
00:11:58,367 --> 00:12:00,633
- WE GOTTA ASK MY MOM FIRST.
- I NEVER THREW ONE BEFORE.

307
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:03,200
OKAY.

308
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,067
- OKAY.

309
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,700
- NICOLE AND I
GOTTA ASK YOU SOMETHING.

310
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,700
- OH, MY GOD.

311
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,900
YOU WANT TO ASK ME SOMETHING
OR TELL ME SOMETHING?

312
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,267
- I LOVE MESSING
WITH MY MOM

313
00:12:12,267 --> 00:12:13,733
'CAUSE MY MOM'S A NERVOUS WRECK
ALL THE TIME.

314
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,333
SHE'S A KOOK.

315
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,700
- REMEMBER WHEN WE SAT YOU DOWN
AND SAID WE WERE PREGNANT?

316
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,367
- YEAH.
- THAT WAS FUNNY.

317
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:20,633
- WELL, WHEN I WENT OUT
LAST WEEK, SOMETHING HAPPENED.

318
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:23,100
- IS THIS A JOKE?
- [laughs]

319
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
- ALL RIGHT,
'CAUSE I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

320
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,833
OH, MY GOD. I CAN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE, I SWEAR TO GOD.

321
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,867
I GOTTA SIT EVERY TIME
YOU TWO TALK TO ME.

322
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:31,467
- WE WANT TO THROW JENNI
AND ROGER

323
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:32,867
A SURPRISE ENGAGEMENT PARTY.

324
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:33,933
- OKAY.

325
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:34,967
- BUT WE WANT TO DO IT HERE,

326
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:35,933
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF WE COULD.

327
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,500
- OKAY.

328
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,600
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
ANYTHING.

329
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,100
- YOU'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING?

330
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,600
- YEAH, LIKE, I'LL ORDER FOOD
AND, YOU KNOW.

331
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,767
- WE'LL GET IT CATERED.

332
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,200
- SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING.

333
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
- OH, I HATE THAT.
CAN'T WE JUST DO THINGS?

334
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,367
- BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL OBLIGATED

335
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,700
THAT YOU HAVE TO COOK
AND CRAP.

336
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,167
- NO, WE COULD DO IT.

337
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,267
- I MEAN, I'LL HELP.
YEAH, I'LL HELP.

338
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:54,067
- WHY DO YOU GOT
LORENZO'S POOP FACE ON?

339
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:55,900
- 'CAUSE YOU TWO MAKE ME--
- WE JUST SCARED HER.

340
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,067
- YEAH, YOU TWO JUST--
- GET HER A XANAX!

341
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,300
[laughter]

342
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,300
- AND A VODKA, PLEASE.
A CHASER.

343
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,400
- BUT LISTEN TO ME.
IT--IT'S A SURPRISE.

344
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,133
- OH.
- DON'T TELL NOBODY.

345
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,600
- YEAH.
- WHO WOULD I TELL?

346
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,067
- YOU'RE BAD AT SURPRISES.
I KNOW YOU.

347
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,600
- BUT WHO WOULD I TELL
THAT KNOWS JENNI?

348
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,633
- WE'RE INVITING, LIKE,
HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

349
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:16,267
- JENNI'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY.
- GIVE OR TAKE 100.

350
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:20,100
- SERIOUSLY, STOP. REALLY.
- [laughs] NO.

351
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,633
- * AND I WANT TO SLEEP
BESIDE YOU *

352
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:27,900
- CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF HE STARTED WALKING?

353
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,367
MAKE HIM WALK.
HE'S SO CUTE!

354
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:37,067
- HE'S SO LITTLE.
HE CAN CRAWL. OOH!

355
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,967
- NOW DO SOME TUMMY TIME.

356
00:13:38,967 --> 00:13:40,500
- BABE, YOU GOT TO START
THESE THINGS EARLY.

357
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,800
- ALL RIGHT.
DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

358
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,067
- SO HE DEVELOPS FAST,
YOU KNOW?

359
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:44,633
I'M GIVING LORENZO
AN EARLY START.

360
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:47,067
WE'RE DOING TUMMY TIME.
WE'RE TRYING TO WALK.

361
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,400
HE'S GONNA BE A BEAST.

362
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,067
THE MORE I TRAIN HIM
AND GET HIM READY,

363
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:51,867
THE FASTER HE'LL BE WALKING
AND GOING NUTS.

364
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,467
- TO THE OLYMPICS.

365
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:56,067
- LOOK.
SEE, HE'S SO STRONG.

366
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:58,933
- GOOD.
HE'LL BE A GOOD WRESTLER.

367
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,900
- [laughs]

368
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,200
HE'S GONNA FART SOON.
I KNOW IT.

369
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,500
[laughs]

370
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,867
- WHAT'D HE DO?
- BRRRRRRR!

371
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,833
IS IT NORMAL?
- WHAT?

372
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:09,967
- THAT KIDS FART
AS MUCH AS OURS?

373
00:14:09,967 --> 00:14:11,333
- I DON'T KNOW.

374
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,900
- HE'S TRYING SO HARD,
HE'S FARTING.

375
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,633
- [laughs]
- HIS LEGS ARE UP.

376
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:18,400
[laughs]
I LOVE THIS KID, I SWEAR.

377
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,067
- LORENZO IS
THE COOLEST KID EVER.

378
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,500
I MEAN, HE'S ALREADY
DOING TUMMY TIME

379
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,767
AND LIFTING UP HIS NECK.

380
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:24,200
I MEAN,
HE'S A STRONG BABY.

381
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,600
HE'S LIKE A GENIUS.

382
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,067
I'M GOING TO BED.

383
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:31,067
- BED, LITTLE GIPPER.

384
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:33,400
- GOOD NIGHT, LORENZO.
I LOVE YOU.

385
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,967
I LOVE YOU.
[kisses]

386
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,567
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

387
00:14:36,567 --> 00:14:39,333
AH!
[laughs]

388
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,733
OW! BABE, OW!
[laughs]

389
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:45,467
- THIS KID IS
A FRIGGIN' MUTANT.

390
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,467
HE'S STRONG.
HE'S LIKE AN OX.

391
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:48,567
HE'S PULLING NICOLE'S HAIR,
AND I'M LOVING IT.

392
00:14:48,567 --> 00:14:50,100
- HE'S NOT EVEN
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT YET.

393
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,067
- OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

394
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:56,867
*I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, I'M-- *
- [laughs]

395
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:58,067
[laughing]

396
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,600
- STILL DRUNK?

397
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,067
- WE'RE THROWING A PARTY.

398
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,467
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A "MEET LORENZO" PARTY.

399
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:04,700
- I'LL COME BY MYSELF.

400
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,467
- I WANT BOTH OF YOU
TO COME.

401
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:10,233
- ROGER--HE LEFT YESTERDAY.
- WHERE'D HE GO?

402
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:12,267
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

403
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,067
- MASSIVE.
- KILL IT NOW.

404
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,400
JIONNI, PLEASE KILL IT.

405
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,800
- [groans]
I CAN'T WATCH IT.

406
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:23,267
- *SOMETIMES *

407
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:27,300
* I CAN'T SLEEP *

408
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,167
*SO I *

409
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,600
- YOU'RE HERE?

410
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,967
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE.
- I'VE BEEN HERE.

411
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:35,433
- ARE YOU ANGRY?
- NO.

412
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:37,833
- OH. WHY DIDN'T YOU
GO UP AND SEE ME?

413
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,933
- I WAS JUST DOWN HERE,
WATCHING TV, JENNI. THAT'S ALL.

414
00:15:40,933 --> 00:15:42,833
I THOUGHT YOU WERE,
HONESTLY, SLEEPING.

415
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,767
I'M AMAZED YOU'RE AWAKE.
- I KNOW.

416
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:47,867
I'VE BEEN IN BED ALL DAY.
- ALL DAY.

417
00:15:47,867 --> 00:15:50,733
YOU'RE IN NO DIFFERENT POSITION
THAN I WAS IN LAST WEEKEND,

418
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:54,067
BUT I GOT UP WITH WORSE
OF A HANGOVER THAN YOU HAVE,

419
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:55,633
AND I WENT
AND GOT YOU BREAKFAST.

420
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:58,467
WE DIDN'T HAVE PLANS
TO DO ANYTHING TOO STRENUOUS.

421
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:00,667
WE'RE TALKING MINIATURE GOLF
AND HANGING OUT

422
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,233
AT AN AMUSEMENT PARK,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

423
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:04,133
LIKE, IT'S NOT THAT HARD
TO DO.

424
00:16:04,133 --> 00:16:05,167
- PLANS GOT [bleep] UP.

425
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:06,400
PLANS GET [bleep] UP
EVERY DAY.

426
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,367
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT BIG
OF A DEAL.

427
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,333
- REMEMBER YOU SAID THAT.

428
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,567
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

429
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,367
WHERE THIS, LIKE, ANIMOSITY
COMES FROM.

430
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:13,500
IT DRIVES ME NUTS.

431
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,267
- YOU MADE PLANS FOR TODAY,

432
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,233
AND YOU SAID, NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,

433
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:20,133
YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO GO TODAY
'CAUSE MY EXACT WORDS WERE,

434
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:21,967
"YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET OUT OF
BED. YOU'RE GONNA BE HUNG OVER."

435
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:24,567
YOU SAID, "NO, I WON'T DO THAT.
I'LL ABSOLUTELY GET UP."

436
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,967
- 'CAUSE I HONESTLY
THOUGHT NICOLE

437
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:27,567
WASN'T GONNA DRINK
THE WAY SHE DID.

438
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:28,867
- SO I GET A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT
OF--

439
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:30,300
YOU'RE BLAMING THIS
ON NICOLE NOW?

440
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,133
- NO, I JUST SAID THAT THIS
WOULD BE A VERY LIMITED NIGHT,

441
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,433
AND SO I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE LIKE--

442
00:16:33,433 --> 00:16:35,067
- SO WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?

443
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:37,267
HOW MUCH NICOLE DRINKS--WHAT
DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH YOU?

444
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:39,367
- I WANTED TO LET LOOSE
AND HAVE FUN.

445
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:42,067
- OH, MY GOOD LORD, SO YOU'RE
BLAMING THIS ON NICOLE.

446
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,667
- I'M NOT BLAMING IT
ON NICOLE AT ALL, BUT--

447
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,767
- I JUST SAID--MY QUESTION
TO YOU--LET'S JUST REITERATE.

448
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,067
MY QUESTION WAS--
- MY ANSWER TO YOU IS...

449
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:48,833
- I CAN'T BELIEVE--I SAID--

450
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,733
- I GOT [bleep] UP
JUST AS MUCH AS NICOLE

451
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:53,500
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY WAS HAVING
A GOOD TIME WITH HER.

452
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,567
I AM OBVIOUSLY GETTING CRUCIFIED
FOR THAT RIGHT NOW.

453
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:59,267
- NOT CRUCIFIED.
DOUBLE STANDARDS.

454
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,433
YOU HAVE DOUBLE STANDARDS.
- IT'S NOT A DOUBLE STANDARD.

455
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:02,133
- JENNI STILL IS NOT EVEN

456
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:04,800
GRASPING THE CONCEPT
OF WHY I'M MAD.

457
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,067
I DON'T CARE THAT YOU GUYS
HAD THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE.

458
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,133
I DON'T CARE.

459
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,900
YOU STILL SHOULD
HAVE BEEN UP TODAY

460
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,967
AND KEPT THE PLANS
THAT WE HAD.

461
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:13,567
I DIDN'T DO THIS, JENNI.
YOU DID THIS.

462
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:16,067
- NOR DID I. CAN I EXPLAIN IT,
OR ARE YOU GONNA CUT ME OFF?

463
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,733
- YOU GOT OUT OF BED AT 4:00.

464
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:19,300
- CAN I EXPLAIN IT,
OR ARE YOU GONNA CUT ME OFF?

465
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,433
- DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.
YOU'LL LOSE.

466
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:21,933
DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT, JENNI.

467
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:24,467
- I WOKE UP.
- YOU WILL LOSE. ARE WE CLEAR?

468
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:27,367
- I WOKE UP TO YOUR FOOD
AND WHATEVER.

469
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:31,633
I SAID I WAS GOING BACK TO BED.
I GO BACK TO BED.

470
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,967
YOU COME UP. YOU SAY THAT YOU--
WHATEVER--WHAT,

471
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,500
THAT YOU WERE GOING OUT.

472
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,400
OH, NICE, SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LET ME FINISH, RIGHT?

473
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,267
- DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE I'M A LITTLE KID.

474
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,700
- YOU WERE TALKING TO ME
LIKE I'M A KID.

475
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,733
- YOU ARE A KID, JENNI.
YOU ARE A KID.

476
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:44,400
- NO, I'M NOT.
I'M A 27-YEAR-OLD ADULT.

477
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,267
- YOU'RE A 27-YEAR-OLD ADULT
THAT ACTS LIKE YOU'RE 5.

478
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:50,067
- OKAY. SO WHY DID YOU--
WHY DID YOU GET ENGAGED TO ME?

479
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:51,533
- 'CAUSE YOU BEGGED ME
TO GET ENGAGED TO YOU.

480
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:52,767
- OH.

481
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:53,800
- DO YOU WANT TO ASK
THAT QUESTION AGAIN?

482
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,067
YOU BEGGED ME.

483
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:56,233
- NO, YOU DON'T--
YOU'RE A GROWN MAN.

484
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:57,400
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

485
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,367
- YOU BEGGED ME
TO PROPOSE TO YOU.

486
00:17:58,367 --> 00:17:59,367
- DIDN'T BEG.

487
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:01,733
- WE JUST GOT ENGAGED,

488
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,100
AND WE'RE FIGHTING
AND BICKERING

489
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,333
OVER FOOLISH,
PETTY THINGS.

490
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,167
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
THIS BICKERING OVER,

491
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:09,500
YOU KNOW, SILLINESS
WAS BEHIND US.

492
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,133
IT DEFINITELY MAKES ME QUESTION
THE TIMING OF MY ENGAGEMENT.

493
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,367
YOU WILL LOSE,
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

494
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,467
- I DIDN'T LOSE ANYTHING
IF I DON'T CARE.

495
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,400
LEAVING?

496
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,333
THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING ME.

497
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,567
VERY ADULT OF YOU.

498
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,833
[groans]
NOW I'M GOING TO BED.

499
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,300
I'M CONCERNED WITH ROGER
BEING REALLY UPSET

500
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,667
'CAUSE SOMETIMES I DON'T KNOW
HOW UPSET HE IS.

501
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,767
AND THAT'S
WHAT I'M KIND OF SCARED OF

502
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:36,433
BECAUSE I COULD HAVE
REALLY PISSED HIM OFF,

503
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:38,267
AND HE DOESN'T WANT TO COME
BACK, SO I'M UPSET ABOUT IT.

504
00:18:38,267 --> 00:18:39,433
IT MAKES ME SAD.

505
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:41,200
THIS ENGAGEMENT
MIGHT BE OVER.

506
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,733
[pop music]

507
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:47,700
- * I WONDER WHAT I'D DO
IF I LOST YOU *

508
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,900
* *

509
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:56,433
* I WONDER WHAT I'D DO
IF I LOST YOU *

510
00:18:58,433 --> 00:18:59,800
- YOU'RE, LIKE, BEATING HIM.

511
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,633
- YEAH,
BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

512
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:03,267
- YEAH, LET'S JUST PUNCH
A BABY.

513
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,633
- ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, PFFT.

514
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:08,067
- YOU HARDCORE MADE OUT
WITH RYDER

515
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:09,633
FOR, LIKE,
A MINUTE AND A HALF.

516
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:10,800
LIKE, SHE WAS
STRADDLING YOU.

517
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,833
- WELL, I MIGHT NOT BE
ENGAGED AFTER THIS.

518
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:18,533
- * YOU TAKE ME BACKWARDS *

519
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,400
* FORWARDS *

520
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,900
*MAKIN' ME CRAZY *

521
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,400
* I CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT YOUR LOVE *

522
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,700
- IT'S QUIET IN THE HOUSE
WITHOUT ROGER AND DIESEL HERE,

523
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,833
SO I FEEL LIKE I REALLY
PUSHED HIM TO HIS LIMITS,

524
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:36,367
BUT, YOU KNOW, I KNOW
THAT HE'S NOT READY TO TALK

525
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:37,900
BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE
CAME HOME,

526
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,267
SO I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA
HAVE TO GIVE HIM TIME.

527
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:43,633
SOMEONE'S EXTRA HAPPY.

528
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:47,233
IT'S 'CAUSE DIESEL'S NOT HERE
TO GIVE YOU GUYS HEADACHES, HUH?

529
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:51,833
- 20 BUCKS,
JENNI TELLS THE CPR LADY

530
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,167
SHE ALREADY KNOWS
HOW TO DO IT.

531
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,867
- 20?
- YEAH.

532
00:19:54,867 --> 00:19:59,067
- I'LL BET YOU 20 THAT JENNI--
- CORRECTS HER?

533
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,433
- YEAH.
OR MAKES FACES.

534
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,700
- THIS MORNING, I HAVE A LADY
COMING OVER

535
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,800
TO TEACH ME, JIONNI, AND JENNI
HOW TO GIVE CPR ON BABIES,

536
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,833
AND I KNOW JENNI IS GONNA,
YOU KNOW, BE LIKE,

537
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,700
"I ALREADY KNOW CPR."

538
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,667
- SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.
HERE SHE COMES.

539
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:18,033
- BOO?
- HI.

540
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:19,567
YOU LOOK SO CUTE.
- HEY.

541
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:20,733
THANKS.
- HI.

542
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:22,167
- CAN I HOLD HIM?
- OKAY.

543
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:24,700
ARE WE GETTING, LIKE,
CPR CERTIFIED?

544
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,700
- I AM.

545
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,233
I JUST KNOW IT'S ONE BREATH.

546
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:28,667
YOU DON'T DO A BREATH.

547
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:30,067
YOU, LIKE, FILL YOUR MOUTH UP
LIKE THIS,

548
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:33,000
WHERE YOU NEVER BREATHE,
FILL IT UP LIKE A CHIPMUNK,

549
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,967
AND YOU EXHALE INTO THE BABY,
AND IT'S TWO FINGERS.

550
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:39,933
YEAH, AND WHEN YOU HEIMLICH 'EM,
YOU FLIP 'EM TO YOUR LEFT,

551
00:20:39,933 --> 00:20:41,800
LIKE, TUCKED
UNDERNEATH YOUR ARM.

552
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,867
I HAD TO DO THAT ONCE
IN MY LIFE. SCARY.

553
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,133
- YOU--YOU WHAT?
YOU HAD TO DO IT?

554
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:47,467
- I HAD TO HEIMLICH
A TWO-YEAR-OLD.

555
00:20:47,467 --> 00:20:48,733
- GET OUT OF HERE.

556
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:49,700
- YEAH, 'CAUSE HE--
- HOLY [bleep].

557
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,233
[doorbell rings]

558
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:53,367
[Lorenzo fusses]

559
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,233
- BABE, CAN YOU GO
GET THE DOOR?

560
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:58,600
- HI.
- HELLO.

561
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,167
- I CAME TO TEACH CPR.
- OKAY.

562
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,367
- THE FATHER.
- YES.

563
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:03,433
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- JIONNI.

564
00:21:03,433 --> 00:21:04,700
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M AMY.

565
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,533
- COME ON.
COME DOWNSTAIRS.

566
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:08,733
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT CPR STANDS FOR.

567
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:11,067
RESPIRATORY SOMETHING?

568
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:13,233
I JUST KNOW
WE'RE GONNA LEARN IT,

569
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,900
AND MY SON
AIN'T CHOKING AROUND ME.

570
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,733
[Lorenzo fusses]

571
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,067
- HI.
- HI.

572
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:20,533
- I'M AMY.
- NICOLE.

573
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:22,533
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.

574
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:23,833
- GOOD HANDSHAKE.

575
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,633
THIS CPR TEACHER, AMY,
SHE LOOKS LIKE A KOOK,

576
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:27,800
SHE LOOKS LIKE A CRAZY LADY,

577
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,533
AND THIS IS GONNA BE
INTERESTING.

578
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:33,100
- WE'RE GONNA START
WITH CHOKING.

579
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,133
YOU KNOW IT'S A SEVERE,
LIFE-THREATENING EVENT

580
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:39,633
IF THERE IS NO NOISE--
- PURPLE.

581
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:43,167
- IF HE'S TURNING BLUE
OR PURPLE OR A COLOR.

582
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:47,067
- I HAD A KID DO THAT
WITH, UM, CARROTS, BABY CARROTS.

583
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,367
- WHAT YOU DO FOR AN INFANT,

584
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:51,767
AND THAT MEANS BIRTH
TO ONE YEAR OF AGE,

585
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:53,067
IT GOES LIKE THIS.

586
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:54,267
[banging]

587
00:21:54,267 --> 00:21:57,700
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE, LIKE, BEATING HIM.

588
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,833
- YEAH,
BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE?

589
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:01,367
- MM-HMM.

590
00:22:01,367 --> 00:22:02,667
- OKAY.

591
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,067
- YEAH, LET'S JUST PUNCH
A BABY.

592
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:06,167
- THIS LOOKS LIKE CHILD ABUSE
RIGHT NOW.

593
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:09,067
YOU'RE SMACKING THE BABY.
YOU'RE TOSSING IT AROUND.

594
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:10,567
I GUESS
THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO

595
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,100
IF THE BABY IS, LIKE, CHOKING,
BUT IT'S A LITTLE ROUGH.

596
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,067
LIKE, LET THE BABY
BE LIKE THAT. FABULOUS.

597
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,667
- YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE HIM, LIKE,
AT AN ANGLE GOING DOWN.

598
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:19,067
- 20 BUCKS.

599
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:20,400
- BUT THEY USED TO.

600
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,667
FLIP THE BABY BACK.
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

601
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:29,067
FLIP THE BABY BACK.
[laughs]

602
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:31,933
- ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, PFFT.

603
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,300
[whispers]
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

604
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,267
- AH.

605
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:41,200
- DO YOU KNOW THE HEIMLICH?
YOU KNOW IT?

606
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,567
YOU WANT HER TO LEARN
THE HEIMLICH, I'M THINKING.

607
00:22:44,567 --> 00:22:46,067
HERE, COME STAND UP.

608
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:47,267
- STAND UP.
- JIONNI.

609
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:50,333
SO JIONNI COMES UP TO YOU
LIKE THIS.

610
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,533
- [laughs]
- ARE YOU CHOKING?

611
00:22:53,533 --> 00:22:55,100
- AND YOU SAY--
- [groans]

612
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,300
- "I'M GONNA HELP."
JUST AN UPWARD PUSH, THOUGH.

613
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,500
SO WHERE'S HIS BELLY BUTTON?
IT'S WAY DOWN HERE.

614
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,400
SO YOU'RE GONNA COME IN
JUST ABOVE THE BELLY BUTTON.

615
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,933
NICE.

616
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:05,433
- NICOLE MAKES AN ATTEMPT
ON GIVING ME THE HEIMLICH.

617
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:06,700
SHE GETS BEHIND ME

618
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,700
AND JUST STARTS RIDING ME
LIKE SEABISCUIT.

619
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,300
- WELL, I'M TRYING.

620
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,067
AND I NEVER DID HEIMLICH BEFORE.

621
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:15,833
[laughs]
- WHY NOT?

622
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:17,333
- YOU'RE GONNA
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

623
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:19,967
- IF SHE'S REALLY NOT
GONNA HELP YOU--

624
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:21,333
- GO TO THE BACK OF A CHAIR
AND DO IT MYSELF?

625
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,933
- YES.

626
00:23:22,933 --> 00:23:24,067
- YOU'D HAVE BETTER LUCK
WITH A CHAIR, JIONNI.

627
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:25,067
- YOU MIGHT.
- YEAH.

628
00:23:25,067 --> 00:23:28,600
- BUH-BUH.
OKAY?

629
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,967
WHICH IS NOT OFFICIAL,
BUT IT'S KIND OF WHAT PEOPLE DO.

630
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:32,400
- I'LL STICK WITH THE CHAIR.
- HEIMLICH YOURSELF.

631
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,500
- I RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE
THAT THEY PRACTICE ONCE A MONTH.

632
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,300
THEY NEVER PRACTICE,
BUT THEY SHOULD.

633
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,367
- WE'LL PRACTICE.

634
00:23:39,367 --> 00:23:41,067
- WAS THAT A FIST BUMP?
HAVE I DONE--

635
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:42,400
- THAT'S HOW YOU BLOW IT UP.

636
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,500
YOU GOTTA BLOW IT UP, LIKE--
- THAT'S A POUND.

637
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,200
- THERE YOU GO.
- THAT'S A POUND.

638
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,067
- A LITTLE MORE PRACTICE.

639
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:48,467
ONCE A MONTH,
YOU GOTTA DO IT.

640
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:52,200
- [laughs]
WILLY-NILLY, THAT'S GOOD.

641
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,333
- I HONESTLY THINK ME AND JIONNI
ARE DOING A GREAT JOB,

642
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,067
AND IF, GOD FORBID,
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO LORENZO,

643
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:58,567
I THINK
WE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

644
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,733
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE
A VISIT OVER TO YOUR CRIB?

645
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,367
- HE HASN'T SLEPT IN THAT YET.
- HE DOESN'T SLEEP IN IT.

646
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:07,533
- SO BUMPERS GO OUT
WHEN HE COMES IN.

647
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:09,200
I'M A RESPECTER OF GRAVITY.

648
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,667
I'D BE NERVOUS,
HAVING THIS IN.

649
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:13,500
YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING
IN THE CRIB OR THE BASSINET.

650
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,533
- I FEEL LIKE
AMY'S JUST VERY NEUROTIC,

651
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:18,633
AND SHE'S A HIPPIE,
AND SHE JUST NEEDS TO RELAX.

652
00:24:18,633 --> 00:24:20,433
- YOU WANT
A TIGHT-FITTING SHEET.

653
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:22,467
SO I'M GONNA SAY THIS IS NOT
A TIGHT-FITTING SHEET.

654
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:24,233
- OH, MY GOD.
GO AWAY.

655
00:24:24,233 --> 00:24:26,600
- PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS SORRY
I CAME AFTER I LEAVE.

656
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
- AT THIS POINT,
I'M LIKE, "BITCH,

657
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,600
"YOU CAME HERE
TO TEACH ME CPR.

658
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,300
"DON'T TELL ME WHAT'S GOOD
AND WHAT'S NOT GOOD FOR MY BABY.

659
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,667
LIKE, SHUT UP."

660
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,067
- AND YOU PUT HIM
ON HIS BACK TO SLEEP, RIGHT?

661
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:36,100
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

662
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,267
- IT THAT FIRM? NOT REALLY.
- NO.

663
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,200
- SHE PROBABLY LIVES
IN A BOMB SHELTER.

664
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,700
- IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW
BECAUSE...

665
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,333
[laughter]

666
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:47,067
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?
- NO.

667
00:24:47,067 --> 00:24:48,667
- [clears throat]

668
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:52,667
- NONE? NO QUESTIONS?
- NO. PRETTY GOOD, SO FAR.

669
00:24:52,667 --> 00:24:54,833
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

670
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:56,400
- GREAT MEETING YOU.
- THANKS.

671
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,600
- I'LL CARRY THIS UPSTAIRS
FOR YOU.

672
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,100
[laughter]

673
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,633
- ENJOY THE BABY.

674
00:25:02,633 --> 00:25:03,933
- YOU'RE GONNA HIT HER
IN THE FACE.

675
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:05,733
- YEAH, HE ALMOST
BITCH-SMACKED HER.

676
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:08,067
HE LEFT YESTERDAY.
- WHERE'D HE GO?

677
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:09,500
- HE MADE RUDE COMMENTS,

678
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,767
SAYING THAT HE PROPOSED TO ME,
AND HE TOOK IT AS I WAS,

679
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:14,767
LIKE, SHOVING IT DOWN
HIS [bleep] THROAT TO DO IT.

680
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,767
- * WE'RE ALWAYS
ON THE RUN *

681
00:25:19,767 --> 00:25:21,800
- CIAO.
- BYE.

682
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:26,100
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

683
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,067
JIONNI, JIONNI, JIONNI!

684
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:30,067
- WHAT?
- A [bleep] SPIDER!

685
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:31,100
- MASSIVE.

686
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,700
SO I FIND
THIS GIANT [bleep] SPIDER,

687
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,733
CRAWLING ACROSS THE GROUND.

688
00:25:33,733 --> 00:25:35,267
I'M FREAKING
THE [bleep] OUT

689
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:37,633
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
IT JUST CAME FROM, YOU KNOW,

690
00:25:37,633 --> 00:25:40,067
LORENZO'S BASSINET,
AND IT'S A JUICY ONE,

691
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:41,300
AND I'M LIKE,
"OH, MY GOD,

692
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,967
[bleep] SOMEBODY KILL THIS
RIGHT NOW."

693
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:44,067
- KILL IT NOW.

694
00:25:44,067 --> 00:25:45,267
- THAT IS NOT A [bleep] DADDY,
RIGHT?

695
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:46,900
- WOW! WHAT IS THAT?

696
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,533
- THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT THE SPIDER WEB WAS FROM.

697
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:49,967
IT'S GONNA JUMP ON YOUR FACE.

698
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,233
- THAT LOOKS LIKE A, UH,
AN AFRICAN, UH--

699
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:55,067
- JIONNI, IT'S NOT AFRICAN.
CAN YOU JUST STEP ON IT?

700
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,100
- GOOGLE IT
AFTER YOU STEP ON IT.

701
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,133
- COME HERE, BITTY BABY.

702
00:25:57,133 --> 00:25:58,533
- UGH!
- EW!

703
00:25:58,533 --> 00:25:59,833
EVERYONE KNOWS
I'M AFRAID OF SPIDERS

704
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:03,633
AND ANYTHING ELSE WITH 12 LEGS
TO 16 LEGS OR WHATEVER.

705
00:26:03,633 --> 00:26:05,433
- JIONNI, PLEASE KILL IT.

706
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,667
- [groans]
I CAN'T WATCH THAT.

707
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:09,067
- GET IT!
IT'S MOVING, IT'S MOVING!

708
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,400
- OOH!
- GOOD EYE, BOO.

709
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,667
'CAUSE I [bleep]
HATE SPIDERS.

710
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:15,333
EW, JIONNI, WASH YOUR HANDS.
JIONNI!

711
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:18,733
- EW, HE'S TOUCHING IT
BARE-HANDED.

712
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,100
- THAT COULD HAVE,
LIKE, SALMONELLA.

713
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,500
- THAT'S CHICKEN, BUT OKAY.
- WHATEVER.

714
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,733
LIKE, THAT'S DISGUSTING
BECAUSE I LIVE DOWN HERE,

715
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,200
AND WHAT IF THIS SPIDER
JUMPS ON LORENZO?

716
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,933
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

717
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:30,600
[Lorenzo fusses]

718
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,533
OH, WE'RE THROWING A PARTY
ON FRIDAY FOR LORENZO.

719
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:37,300
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A "MEET LORENZO" PARTY.

720
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,500
- OKAY.

721
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,867
- LIKE, FOR ALL MY FRIENDS
AND FAMILY.

722
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,333
I WANT YOU AND ROGER TO COME.

723
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,733
- FRIDAY NIGHT?

724
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:44,967
I'LL COME BY MYSELF.

725
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:47,700
- I WANT BOTH OF YOU TO COME.

726
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,300
- HE LEFT YESTERDAY.

727
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,767
- WHERE'D HE GO?

728
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,067
- ROGER IS MAD AT ME ABOUT,

729
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:56,867
UH, EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE
YESTERDAY, SO HE LEFT,

730
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,633
AND HE'S PROBABLY GONNA BE
GONE FOR A COUPLE DAYS,

731
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:00,267
BECAUSE WHEN YOU TAKE BUBBA,

732
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:01,867
THAT MEANS YOU'RE GONE
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

733
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,567
HE MADE RUDE COMMENTS,

734
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:06,767
SAYING THAT HE PROPOSED TO ME,
AND HE TOOK IT AS I WAS,

735
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:09,500
LIKE, SHOVING IT DOWN
HIS [bleep] THROAT TO DO IT.

736
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,200
- THAT'S NOT TRUE, THOUGH.
- NO, IT REALLY ISN'T.

737
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,767
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

738
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,900
HE ACTUALLY TOLD ME NOT TO SPEAK
HIS NAME TODAY HERE,

739
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,367
SO I'M PROBABLY GONNA
GET YELLED AT FOR THAT.

740
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:19,700
- IS HE HUNGRY?

741
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,367
- YOU CAN GIVE HIM
THE LITTLE 2-OUNCE BOTTLE,

742
00:27:21,367 --> 00:27:22,767
AND THEN I'LL PUMP AGAIN.

743
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,300
- HOW MUCH DID YOU
HAVE TO DUMP?

744
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,067
DID THE STRIPS WORK
THIS TIME?

745
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,967
- OH, MY GOD. IT TURNED,
LIKE, BROWN AND FUZZY.

746
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:30,667
- IT WAS LIKE--
- IT WAS DEFINITELY [bleep] UP.

747
00:27:30,667 --> 00:27:32,067
- IT WAS LIKE--
- CONTAMINATED.

748
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,333
- SERIOUSLY?

749
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,967
- SO I DUMPED TWICE,
JUST IN CASE.

750
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:39,267
AFTER THE LIMO RIDE, WHEN I
GOT HERE, I DON'T REMEMBER.

751
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:41,700
- I DON'T REMEMBER
ANY OF THE RIDE HOME,

752
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,167
EXCEPT FOR, LIKE,
BEING IN THE PARKING LOT

753
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:45,267
AND HER BEING LIKE, "I HAVE
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,"

754
00:27:45,267 --> 00:27:46,933
AND I, LIKE, BLACKED OUT.

755
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:49,800
- HOW MUCH DID WE DRINK?
- I DRANK BEFORE I GOT HERE.

756
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,067
THEN THE SANGRIA I HAD.

757
00:27:51,067 --> 00:27:52,967
THEN THE CHAMPAGNE
AND VODKA AT DINNER.

758
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:55,667
THEN THE--THE SAKE BOMB.

759
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,133
THEN WE WERE DOING SHOTS AT--

760
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,067
- HE'S STILL FARTING.

761
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:00,900
- HI, BOOGIE.

762
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,333
FOR SOME REASON, I REMEMBER YOU,
LIKE, DANCING CRAZY.

763
00:28:03,333 --> 00:28:06,533
- YOU WIPED OUT 'CAUSE YOUR HAIR
WAS SOAKING WET.

764
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:08,500
SO YOU, LIKE, STARTED
GIVING ME A LAP DANCE,

765
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,533
AND I PUT MY HAND ON YOUR HAIR,
AND IT WAS DRIPPING.

766
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:13,067
- OH, 'CAUSE IT
WAS RAINING OUTSIDE,

767
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,433
AND I KEPT GOING
TO HAVE CIGARETTES.

768
00:28:15,433 --> 00:28:17,967
- YOU, LIKE,
MOPPED THE FLOOR.

769
00:28:17,967 --> 00:28:20,067
- I WOKE UP, AND JIONNI'S LIKE,
"YOU STINK."

770
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:21,767
- [laughs]
- REMEMBER?

771
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:23,300
YOU TOLD ME I SMELL.

772
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,300
- HERE,
I'LL TAKE HIM UPSTAIRS.

773
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,833
- I DON'T WANT
TO LET YOU GO.

774
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,100
- I'M GONNA BRING HIM
TO MY GRANDMA'S.

775
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,433
- IS HE HUNGRY?
- HE HAS MILK UPSTAIRS TOO.

776
00:28:32,433 --> 00:28:35,267
BE RIGHT BACK.

777
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:38,067
- I TOLD ROGER WE MADE OUT.

778
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:41,433
- WHAT? WE MADE OUT?
- YEAH.

779
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:43,400
- I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

780
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,133
- WE ONLY MADE OUT FOR,
LIKE, TWO SECONDS.

781
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:47,367
YOU HARDCORE MADE OUT
WITH RYDER

782
00:28:47,367 --> 00:28:48,933
FOR, LIKE,
A MINUTE AND A HALF.

783
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:50,100
LIKE, SHE WAS
STRADDLING YOU.

784
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,233
- WE MADE OUT?

785
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:52,233
- MM-HMM.
- [bleep] IT.

786
00:28:52,233 --> 00:28:54,333
- I HOPE JIONNI
DOESN'T MIND.

787
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,067
- HE'LL PROBABLY
GET MAD AT THAT.

788
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,467
- FROM WHAT I RECALL,
NICOLE IS AN AMAZING KISSER.

789
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:00,500
LOTS OF TONGUE.

790
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,633
- OH, GOD!

791
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:03,100
I DIDN'T KNOW WE MADE OUT.

792
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,833
- YOU WERE ON TOP OF LAURA,
LIKE, MADLY IN LOVE WITH HER,

793
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:07,867
TRYING TO MAKE OUT WITH HER.

794
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:09,067
- OH, MY GOD.

795
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:10,267
- AND I BASICALLY
TOOK ONE FOR THE TEAM

796
00:29:10,267 --> 00:29:11,433
'CAUSE LAURA WAS,
LIKE, SCARED.

797
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:12,767
SHE WAS LIKE,
"DO I KISS HER? DO I NOT?"

798
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:14,200
AND I'M LIKE,
"NICOLE, YOU WANT TO MAKE OUT?"

799
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,467
AND YOU'RE LIKE...

800
00:29:15,467 --> 00:29:17,200
AND THEN YOU ENDED UP
ON RYDER.

801
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,933
- THAT'S AWESOME.

802
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:20,667
RIGHT WHEN JENNI TELLS ME
THAT I DID ALL THIS [bleep],

803
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:23,133
I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA GO TO THE PRINCIPAL'S

804
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:24,700
AND GET IN A LOT OF TROUBLE

805
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,267
BECAUSE I KNOW JIONNI'S GONNA BE
VERY PISSED OFF AT ME.

806
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:29,100
- I ASSUMED YOU KNEW.

807
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,433
I WAS JUST NOT GONNA, LIKE,
BRING IT UP WITH HIM.

808
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:32,967
- NO, I HAD NO IDEA.

809
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:34,933
- YOU WERE JUST DRUNK
'CAUSE YOU WERE HAPPY.

810
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:36,433
I HONESTLY--
- I HAD THE BEST TIME EVER.

811
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:37,700
- NEVER THOUGHT
IN A MILLION YEARS,

812
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,100
YOU WERE GONNA BE
LIKE THAT.

813
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,333
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
REALLY GONNA BE RESERVED.

814
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:42,633
- ME TOO.
- YOUR ALTER EGO CAME OUT.

815
00:29:42,633 --> 00:29:46,167
- WELL, I'M NEVER
DOING THAT AGAIN THAT CRAZY.

816
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,467
IT'S NOT, LIKE,
A GOOD LOOK FOR A MOM.

817
00:29:48,467 --> 00:29:50,333
- I KNOW SO MANY MOMS
THAT DO THAT.

818
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:54,400
- NOT FOR JIONNI.
- [laughs]

819
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,567
- AND HE WON'T BE WITH ME
IF I DO THAT.

820
00:29:56,567 --> 00:29:58,867
JIONNI DOESN'T MIND ME
GOING OUT,

821
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:00,900
GOING CRAZY WITH MY FRIENDS,
GETTING DRUNK,

822
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,367
BUT, LIKE, BEING HIS FIANCEE
AND, LIKE, BEING A MOM,

823
00:30:04,367 --> 00:30:06,000
HE DOESN'T WANT ME TO,
YOU KNOW,

824
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,233
BE MAKING OUT WITH MY FRIENDS
ANYMORE.

825
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:08,800
THAT'S LIKE--
- HIGH SCHOOL?

826
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,467
- THAT'S, LIKE, SINGLE ME,
AND I KNOW, YOU KNOW,

827
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:14,100
THIS IS GONNA CAUSE
A SERIOUS PROBLEM.

828
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,600
WELL, I MIGHT NOT BE
ENGAGED AFTER THIS.

829
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,567
- YEAH. ME EITHER.
- [bleep].

830
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,033
- I MIGHT HAVE TO RETURN
MY RING.

831
00:30:20,033 --> 00:30:23,633
- ME TOO.
I'M LIKE, OH, DEAR.

832
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,600
I TEXT JIONNI,
"LISTEN, AT THE CLUB LAST NIGHT,

833
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,167
I DID BLACK OUT,
AND I MADE OUT WITH RYDER."

834
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:33,567
- HOW MANY MOMS DO YOU KNOW

835
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:35,200
THAT HOOK UP WITH GIRLS
AT CLUBS?

836
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,500
- SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE WITH ME NOW?

837
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,800
- YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.

838
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:43,233
[alternative music]

839
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:44,733
* *

840
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:47,133
- WELL, I MIGHT NOT BE
ENGAGED AFTER THIS.

841
00:30:47,133 --> 00:30:48,433
JIONNI MIGHT BREAK UP
WITH ME.

842
00:30:48,433 --> 00:30:50,567
- OVER THAT?
- YEAH.

843
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:52,600
- OVER WHAT PART?
- MAKING OUT.

844
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,333
- YOU MADE OUT WITH DEENA
BEFORE THIS.

845
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:55,833
- YEAH, AND HE HATED ME
FOR IT.

846
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,433
DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME
LOOK LIKE A BAD MOM?

847
00:30:58,433 --> 00:31:00,067
- YOU'RE NOT A BAD MOTHER.

848
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:01,400
EVERY MOTHER'S
GONNA MAKE MISTAKES.

849
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,633
EVERY MOTHER WANTS TO HAVE
A DRINK AND HAVE A GOOD TIME

850
00:31:04,633 --> 00:31:06,867
AND LET LOOSE AFTER MONTHS
OF [bleep] CARRYING A CHILD.

851
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:09,433
NOBODY HAS A RIGHT
TO TELL SOMEONE

852
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:10,933
THAT CARRIES A CHILD
FOR NINE MONTHS HOW TO ACT.

853
00:31:10,933 --> 00:31:12,167
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

854
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:14,867
YOU CAN BE THE BEST MOTHER
YOU CAN BE,

855
00:31:14,867 --> 00:31:16,233
AND YOU CAN STILL BE SNOOKI.

856
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,367
STOP BEING THE PERSON
THAT YOU THINK YOU HAVE TO BE,

857
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:19,633
AND JUST BE YOU.

858
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:21,733
- I'M ONLY LIKE THAT
'CAUSE OF JIONNI.

859
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:23,100
- I KNOW. STOP.
- HE, LIKE--

860
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,967
- HE--IF HE DOESN'T MARRY YOU
FOR YOU,

861
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,367
THEN YOU SHOULDN'T
GET MARRIED.

862
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:27,633
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE FAKE.

863
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:29,067
I CAN SEE IT SOMETIMES.

864
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:30,433
I SEE HOW [bleep] RESERVED
YOU ARE.

865
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:31,967
IT DRIVES ME NUTS
'CAUSE I LOVE YOU,

866
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,533
AND I'M LIKE--

867
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:36,767
- IT'S KIND OF GETTING
UNDER MY SKIN A LITTLE BIT.

868
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:38,267
- NICOLE'S JUST TRYING
TO BE A STEPFORD WIFE.

869
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:39,967
SHE'S TRYING TO BE SOMETHING
THAT SHE'S NOT.

870
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:42,400
SHE'S TRYING TO SAY THAT
SHE LOVES BEING IN THE BASEMENT

871
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,767
AND SITTING THERE ALL DAY AND
WATCHING TV SHOWS WITH JIONNI,

872
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:46,933
BUT I KNOW, DEEP DOWN,
SHE DOESN'T.

873
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:48,400
- DON'T EVER SAY ANYTHING

874
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,067
'CAUSE IT WILL JUST
CAUSE PROBLEMS.

875
00:31:50,067 --> 00:31:52,300
- OH, I KNOW, BUT HE HAS
TO [bleep] CUT HIS [bleep] OUT,

876
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,733
SERIOUSLY,
OR HE'S GONNA LOSE YOU.

877
00:31:53,733 --> 00:31:55,567
- NO, BUT WHEN I TELL HIM THIS,
WE'RE GONNA--

878
00:31:55,567 --> 00:31:57,367
- FIGHT. YOU DIDN'T CHEAT,
YOU DIDN'T LIE.

879
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:59,067
- I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT.
- YOU DIDN'T DISRESPECT HIM.

880
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:00,733
- I HATE FIGHTING.
- OH, I KNOW.

881
00:32:00,733 --> 00:32:02,467
BUT, LIKE, THEN,
LET HIM FIGHT WITH HIMSELF.

882
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:04,300
LET HIM FIGHT THE [bleep] WALL,
AND YOU BE LIKE,

883
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,067
"I HAD A GOOD TIME.
NOW DEAL WITH IT."

884
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:07,900
I THINK NICOLE
IS BOWING DOWN TO JIONNI.

885
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:11,133
FIGHTS HAPPEN, BUT YOU
SHOULD BE THE REAL YOU.

886
00:32:11,133 --> 00:32:13,500
THERE'S NO LONGEVITY
IN THAT RELATIONSHIP

887
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,433
BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO
STOP BEING FAKE SOONER OR LATER.

888
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:19,233
JIONNI IS TRYING TO CHANGE YOU
INTO, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

889
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:20,867
IT JUST HURTS ME,
SEEING THAT.

890
00:32:20,867 --> 00:32:23,667
IF YOU WERE OKAY WITH IT,
I WOULD BE COMPLETELY FINE.

891
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,533
IF YOU WERE LIKE, "I'M TOTALLY
INTO BEING SUSIE HOMEMAKER.

892
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:29,300
I [bleep] LOVE WASHING DISHES,"
I WOULD BE SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

893
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,967
BUT YOU'RE NOT HAPPY.

894
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:34,933
- SHUT UP.
- I KNOW.

895
00:32:34,933 --> 00:32:38,700
- I'M NOT, LIKE, MISERABLE.
- I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE NOT YOU.

896
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,633
- WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE HIM.

897
00:32:40,633 --> 00:32:41,933
- NO, AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

898
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:43,600
AND MAYBE A REALITY CHECK
FOR HIM WILL BE GOOD.

899
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,700
HE GIVES YOU REALITY CHECKS
ALL THE TIME, NO?

900
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,333
- YEAH, HE TRIES TO.

901
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,933
- EXACTLY.
SO [bleep] GIVE HIM ONE.

902
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:50,433
I'M NOT TELLING YOU TO GO
[bleep] BREAK UP WITH HIS ASS.

903
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:51,600
GOOD LORD.

904
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,400
- WELL, ME MAKING OUT
WITH YOU AND RYDER

905
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,167
IS DISRESPECTING HIM,
TO HIM.

906
00:32:56,167 --> 00:32:57,767
- HOW?
- TO HIM.

907
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,167
- BUT THAT'S
HIS OWN INSECURITY.

908
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:00,767
"WHAT IS THIS PERSON
GONNA SAY?

909
00:33:00,767 --> 00:33:01,967
"WHAT IS
THAT PERSON GONNA SAY?

910
00:33:01,967 --> 00:33:05,067
"MY FIANCEE SNOOKI MADE OUT
WITH TWO GIRLS

911
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,333
"ON THE NIGHT
THAT SHE WENT OUT

912
00:33:06,333 --> 00:33:07,533
'CAUSE SHE HASN'T DRANK
IN TEN MONTHS."

913
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:08,900
IS THAT REALLY
THAT BIG OF A DEAL?

914
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,567
DOES SHE HAVE ANY REGRETS?

915
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:12,067
AND IF THEY ALL ADD UP
IN A POSITIVE,

916
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:13,567
WHY DOES HE HAVE
TO MAKE IT A NEGATIVE?

917
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:14,767
IT'S NOT THAT BIG
OF A DEAL.

918
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,167
- I'M SCARED.

919
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:18,433
RIGHT NOW, I KNOW I'M GONNA BE
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

920
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:20,800
I'M JUST SO NERVOUS
TO TELL JIONNI,

921
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,100
AND I HONESTLY JUST WANT
TO HIDE IN A HOLE.

922
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,333
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

923
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,433
- MAKE HIM REALIZE
WHO HE FELL IN LOVE WITH.

924
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,633
BUT JUST KNOW,
I CAN TELL,

925
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,733
AND IF I CAN TELL,
OTHERS CAN TELL.

926
00:33:30,733 --> 00:33:32,333
- ALL RIGHT.
GET OUT OF HERE.

927
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:35,300
- LOVE YOU. BYE.

928
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,367
TOODLES.

929
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:41,100
DON'T DROWN YOURSELF IN THE TUB
AFTER THAT CONVO.

930
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,800
- OH, MY BOOB HURTS.
I'VE GOT TO PUMP SOON.

931
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:47,600
- * I KIND OF KNEW
ALL ALONG *

932
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,633
* THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN *
- OH, MAN, I'M SCREWED.

933
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:52,933
SO JIONNI'S IN THE ROOM
WITH ME, AND HONESTLY,

934
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:54,467
LIKE, I CAN'T GET
ANY WORDS OUT.

935
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,733
I'M SO SCARED TO TELL HIM
THAT, YOU KNOW,

936
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:58,933
I JUST WANT TO TEXT HIM
AND TELL HIM INSTEAD

937
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:02,500
BECAUSE I HONESTLY CAN'T
TELL HIM TO HIS FACE.

938
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,533
I TEXT JIONNI, "LISTEN,"

939
00:34:04,533 --> 00:34:06,467
LIKE, "I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
BE UPSET WITH ME.

940
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:08,067
"I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

941
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:10,600
"BUT AT THE CLUB LAST NIGHT,
I DID BLACK OUT,

942
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,833
"AND I MADE OUT WITH JENNI,
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY,

943
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:15,700
AND JUST PLEASE
DON'T HATE ME."

944
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:21,200
- *IT WON'T BE LONG BEFORE YOU
BREAK MY HEART IN TWO *

945
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,067
* OH, BABY, I HOPE *

946
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:27,700
* YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ME *

947
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,833
*OH, BABY, I HOPE... *

948
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:34,467
- TOO MUCH OF A COWARD
TO TELL ME BEFORE?

949
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:36,133
STAY AWAY FROM ME, OKAY?

950
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:37,767
FAR, FAR AWAY.

951
00:34:37,767 --> 00:34:42,267
- * IT WON'T BE LONG
BEFORE I CRY A TEAR FOR YOU *

952
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:45,267
- YOU KNOW, IT JUST HURTS
BECAUSE I LOVE HIM,

953
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:46,300
AND HE KNOWS I LOVE HIM,

954
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,433
AND JUST TO TELL ME
TO [bleep] OFF,

955
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:50,067
AND HE DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ME,

956
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:52,067
IT'S JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW,
"DO YOU LOVE ME?

957
00:34:52,067 --> 00:34:54,267
BECAUSE I COULDN'T
THROW YOU AWAY LIKE THAT."

958
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:57,233
- * OH, BABY, I HOPE *

959
00:34:57,233 --> 00:35:00,333
* YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING *

960
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:01,867
- I DON'T GET IT.

961
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,633
- * OH, BABY, I HOPE *

962
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:08,200
* YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING *

963
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,800
- THERE'S MORE SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW
ON THE WAY.

964
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,367
- AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

965
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:20,167
- *IF I TRIED
MY VERY BEST *

966
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:23,800
* TOLD YOU EVERYTHING,
CONFESSED *

967
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,067
* WOULD YOU SAVE ME? *

968
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:30,833
* WOULD YOU
SAVE ME? *

969
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:34,833
*IF I LAUGH *

970
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,433
* IF I CRY *

971
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:40,067
- SO RIGHT WHEN I TELL JIONNI,
YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED,

972
00:35:40,067 --> 00:35:41,800
"I MADE OUT WITH JENNI,
I'M SO SORRY,"

973
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,333
JIONNI TEXTED ME, "YOU NEED
TO MOVE OUT OF THE HOUSE.

974
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:47,467
STAY AWAY
FROM LORENZO AND ME."

975
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:49,067
I'M A PIECE OF [bleep].
I'M A HORRIBLE MOM.

976
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:51,433
I'M A HORRIBLE FIANCEE.

977
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:52,833
CAN YOU SIT DOWN?

978
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,567
- YEAH.
HOLD ON.

979
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:58,767
- * IF I MADE
A BIG MISTAKE *

980
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:00,700
* WOULD YOU FORGIVE ME? *

981
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,200
- YOU KNOW,
IT BREAKS MY HEART

982
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,500
THAT HE'S BEING SO MEAN

983
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,833
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
I DESERVE IT.

984
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,433
- * SAVE ME *

985
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:13,200
- WHY ARE YOU GONNA END US
JUST BECAUSE I KISSED JENNI?

986
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,667
- WHAT'D YOU SAY TO ME
BEFORE YOU LEFT?

987
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,333
"I'M NOT THAT GIRL ANYMORE.

988
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,333
"I HAVE A SON NOW.

989
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,600
I'M A FIANCEE."

990
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,100
OH, "YOU'RE MAKING ME
FEEL GUILTY

991
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,767
FOR HAVING FUN
WITH MY FRIENDS."

992
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:24,767
HOW DO YOU FEEL
RIGHT NOW? GUILTY?

993
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,567
- I FEEL LIKE [bleep].

994
00:36:26,567 --> 00:36:27,767
- YOU FEEL LIKE [bleep].

995
00:36:27,767 --> 00:36:29,767
SO AM I A BAD PERSON
FOR BEING MAD ABOUT IT?

996
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,533
- I'M NOT SAYING
YOU'RE A BAD PERSON,

997
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:34,233
BUT WHY DO YOU NOT WANT
TO GET MARRIED NOW

998
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,533
JUST BECAUSE OF THIS?

999
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:39,800
AND I'M A HORRIBLE MOM
AND A FIANCEE.

1000
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,367
- HOW MANY MOMS DO YOU KNOW THAT
HOOK UP WITH GIRLS AT CLUBS?

1001
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,133
- SO YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE WITH ME NOW?

1002
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,600
- I DIDN'T SAY I DIDN'T
WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

1003
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,533
- DO YOU WANT ME TO READ THE
TEXT MESSAGES? BECAUSE I WILL.

1004
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:50,800
- HOW MANY FIANCEES GO OUT
AND HOOK UP WITH GIRLS AT CLUBS?

1005
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,300
- OKAY, I WENT
A LITTLE OVERBOARD.

1006
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,467
- I DON'T CARE
IF YOU HURT ME.

1007
00:36:54,467 --> 00:36:55,967
YOU [bleep] ME OVER IN ITALY
PRETTY DAMN BAD.

1008
00:36:55,967 --> 00:36:58,233
ALL THE RUMORS ABOUT MIKE
HURT PRETTY BAD.

1009
00:36:58,233 --> 00:36:59,700
I COULD DEAL WITH THAT
MY OWN WAY.

1010
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,933
BUT NOW YOU'RE [bleep]
HURTING HIM.

1011
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:02,267
- 'CAUSE I KISSED JENNI,

1012
00:37:02,267 --> 00:37:03,833
I'M HURTING MY SON?

1013
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:07,067
- YOU KISSED JENNI? YOU THINK
THAT'S ALL THAT HAPPENED?

1014
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,967
WHEN YOU WERE HOOKING UP
WITH JENNI,

1015
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:11,633
WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT ME
OR LORENZO? OBVIOUSLY NOT.

1016
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:15,133
IF NICOLE DOESN'T THINK
SHE'S WRONG FOR WHAT SHE DID,

1017
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,333
THEN IT'S GONNA BE A WHILE
BEFORE WE GET MARRIED, IF WE DO.

1018
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:20,467
NOW, YOU EITHER COULD GO GET
HELP ABOUT YOUR DRINKING

1019
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,800
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

1020
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,067
- JIONNI, THIS IS MY FIRST TIME
GOING OUT IN TEN MONTHS.

1021
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:27,067
I DRANK A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH,
AND [bleep] GOT WILD.

1022
00:37:27,067 --> 00:37:28,600
SO I NEED TO GO GET HELP?
- YEAH.

1023
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,867
WHEN YOU DRINK,
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

1024
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:30,933
NICOLE,
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME

1025
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:32,667
YOU BLACK OUT AND DRUNK
AND [bleep] UP.

1026
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,867
- JIONNI, I WAS HAVING FUN.

1027
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:36,967
- I HAD SO MUCH FUN
WITH MY GUY FRIENDS,

1028
00:37:36,967 --> 00:37:38,167
BUT IN THE BACK OF MY MIND,
WE WERE LIKE,

1029
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,300
"HEY, COME ON,
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER SHOT."

1030
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,567
"SORRY, GUYS, I CAN'T.

1031
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:42,067
I HAVE A SON TOMORROW
TO LOOK AFTER."

1032
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:43,500
- OKAY, THAT'S YOU,

1033
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,800
BUT I CELEBRATED ANOTHER WAY
WITH MY FRIENDS.

1034
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,067
- OKAY, WELL,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1035
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:48,433
I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH SOMEBODY
THAT DOES THAT.

1036
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,900
- I HONESTLY COULDN'T IMAGINE
LOSING JIONNI.

1037
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,733
HE'S LEGIT, LIKE,
MY BEST FRIEND,

1038
00:37:52,733 --> 00:37:55,400
SO THE FACT THAT HE'S SAYING
THESE THINGS,

1039
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,533
AND I THOUGHT HE WAS, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, THE LOVE OF MY LIFE

1040
00:37:58,533 --> 00:37:59,633
AND HE WOULD NEVER HURT ME,

1041
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:01,100
I MEAN,
HE'S HURTING ME RIGHT NOW.

1042
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,067
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE ME.

1043
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:04,800
- WHEN YOU DO THAT, NO.

1044
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,600
SO WE'VE GOT
TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT AND--

1045
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,067
- THERE'S NOT GONNA BE
ANYTHING TO FIGURE OUT

1046
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:10,667
BECAUSE THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS.

1047
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:12,467
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
"THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS"?

1048
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:13,867
- I DON'T KNOW.

1049
00:38:13,867 --> 00:38:14,933
DO YOU WANT ME TO READ THE TEXT
MESSAGES THAT YOU SENT ME?

1050
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:16,467
- NO.
- 'CAUSE IT'S NOT OKAY.

1051
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:17,900
- IT'S NOT OKAY WHAT YOU DID.

1052
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,467
- JIONNI, I'M NOT GONNA
DO THAT ALL THE TIME.

1053
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:22,600
I'M NOT GOING OUT LIKE THAT.
IT WAS ONE TIME.

1054
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,700
- IT WAS ONE TIME. OKAY, WHAT'D
YOU SAY TO ME BEFORE THAT?

1055
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,833
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO THEN.

1056
00:38:26,833 --> 00:38:28,200
- YOU NEED TO FIX IT.

1057
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,800
WELL, YOU'RE NOT SAYING
ANYTHING VERY, UH--

1058
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,167
- I JUST DON'T LIKE
THE THINGS YOU SAID TO ME.

1059
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:32,500
IT WAS REALLY MEAN.
- OKAY, OF COURSE.

1060
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,300
TURN IT AROUND ON ME.
- I'M NOT, I'M JUST--

1061
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:38,167
I HAVE FEELINGS TOO,
AND I CAN SAY WHAT I WANT.

1062
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:39,800
- OKAY.

1063
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,767
- GOD.

1064
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:45,367
I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE I'M NOT
THE GIRL THAT JIONNI WANTS.

1065
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:48,400
LIKE, HE WANTS ME TO BE
SOMEBODY THAT, YOU KNOW,

1066
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,900
DOESN'T GO OUT
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME,

1067
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,133
AND I LOVE TO GO OUT
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME,

1068
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:54,667
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE JIONNI
JUST DOESN'T LIKE ME.

1069
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:57,433
- IS THAT IT? JENNI'S
THE ONLY THING THAT HAPPENED?

1070
00:38:57,433 --> 00:39:00,167
GIVING HER LAP DANCES,
DANCING LIKE THAT,

1071
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:02,200
HOOKING UP WITH HER IS THE ONLY
BAD THING THAT HAPPENED?

1072
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,733
YES? NO? MAYBE?

1073
00:39:03,733 --> 00:39:05,467
- WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

1074
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:08,633
- I WANT TO KNOW.
WHAT ELSE HAPPENED?

1075
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:11,067
- SHE SAID I MADE OUT
WITH RYDER TOO.

1076
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:15,200
- ALL RIGHT.

1077
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,833
YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.

1078
00:39:16,833 --> 00:39:18,467
[Lorenzo crying]

1079
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:19,833
AND ON YOUR WAY OUT,
GO TELL MY MOM

1080
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:21,600
WE'RE NOT HAVING
THE PARTY HERE.

1081
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,200
GO RENT A HALL.

1082
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,400
DON'T TELL HER WHY 'CAUSE
YOU'RE GONNA BREAK HER HEART.

1083
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,933
YOU JUST HOOKED UP WITH JENNI
AND RYDER? THAT'S IT?

1084
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:33,233
- YEAH.
- THAT'S IT? ALL RIGHT.

1085
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:34,567
ALL RIGHT.
NOT A BIG DEAL.

1086
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:36,767
BUT I'M THE ASS[bleep].

1087
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:39,067
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

1088
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:42,400
I MEAN, THIS IS THE LAST THING
I WANTED TO EVER HAPPEN,

1089
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,067
YOU KNOW, WAS TO FIGHT
LIKE THIS WITH JIONNI,

1090
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:46,933
AND I JUST HOPE
WE CAN WORK IT OUT

1091
00:39:46,933 --> 00:39:49,867
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD DO

1092
00:39:49,867 --> 00:39:52,500
IF WE DIDN'T WORK OUT.

1093
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,400
[Lorenzo fusses]

1094
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:01,900
[crying]

1095
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,467
- *I CAN'T MAKE YOU CARE *

1096
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:09,600
* IF THERE'S NOTHIN' THERE *

1097
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:15,233
* I CAN'T MAKE ME FORGET *

1098
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:18,533
* I CAN'T MAKE YOU
LOVE ME *

1099
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:21,567
- I'M A GOOD MOM,
I THINK.

1100
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:25,100
- * YOU KNOW
YOU NEVER DID *

1101
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:31,833
- I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW MUCH YOU [bleep] HURT ME.

1102
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,633
EVERY TIME I LET YOU GO OUT,
I GOTTA THINK

1103
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:35,900
ABOUT IF YOU'RE GONNA BLACK OUT
AND HURT ME.

1104
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,033
I DON'T WANT TO MARRY YOU
IF THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GONNA BE.

1105
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:42,367
- IT'S DEFINITELY QUIET
IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT ROGER.

1106
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:43,733
I AM REALLY MISSING HIM.

1107
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:44,967
- HELLO?

1108
00:40:44,967 --> 00:40:46,667
- HEY, I WAS WONDERING

1109
00:40:46,667 --> 00:40:48,567
IF YOU WANTED
TO COME OVER AND TALK.

1110
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:50,633
- UM...

1111
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:52,367
- ISN'T IT FUNNY
HOW WE WERE SO EXCITED

1112
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,500
TO BE, LIKE, ENGAGED,
AND WE'RE BOTH FIGHTING?

1113
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,100
- IS IT THAT BAD?

1114
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,800
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I'M GETTING MARRIED.
