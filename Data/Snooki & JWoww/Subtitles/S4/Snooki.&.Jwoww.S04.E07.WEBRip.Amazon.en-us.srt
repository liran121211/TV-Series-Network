00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,614
BUT I CAN'’T RUIN
THEIR BREAKFAST.

173
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:14,719
IT'’S THEIR ANNIVERSARY.

174
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:19,896
IT'’S FOR THEM GOING FOR DINNER.

175
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:24,176
WHY AM I SNOOPING?

176
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,488
THIS IS VERY RUDE.

177
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:28,974
OH, MY GOD. IS THAT A CINNABON?

178
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,355
MM.

179
00:06:30,355 --> 00:06:32,909
I WANT THAT CINNABON.

180
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:33,841
MM.

181
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:46,647
- JENNI AND I DID HAVE A FIGHT,

182
00:06:46,647 --> 00:06:48,649
BUT IT WASN'’T RIGHT TO LEAVE.

183
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,582
IT'’S TIME
TO MAKE THE WRONG RIGHT.

184
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:52,550
YOU KNOW, I HAVE MY FAILURES
AND I HAVE MY DEMONS,

185
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,828
AND SO DOES JENNI,
BUT THE IMPORTANT PART

186
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:56,726
IS THAT WE WORK THROUGH THEM
AND STAY TOGETHER.

187
00:06:56,726 --> 00:06:58,245
AND IT'’S--

188
00:06:58,245 --> 00:07:00,350
IT'’S IMPORTANT NOW TO WORK
ON THOSE COMMUNICATION SKILLS

189
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,214
MORE THAN EVER
'’CAUSE WE'’RE PARENTS.

190
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,045
Jenni: I KNOW.
- HEY.

191
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,772
- HELLO.

192
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:09,670
- HOW IS SHE?

193
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,361
- FUSSY.

194
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:13,502
- CAN DADDY SEE HER
FOR A MINUTE?

195
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:17,091
- YEAH, WE'’RE ABOUT TO TAKE
A NAP, ACTUALLY.

196
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:20,336
WANT TO GO TO YOUR DADDY?

197
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:23,891
[baby coos]

198
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:25,168
- OKAY.

199
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,209
SO, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

200
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:34,281
SO, ARE WE OKAY?

201
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:37,871
- YEAH, WE'’RE FINE.
WE'’RE JUST TIRED NEW PARENTS.

202
00:07:37,871 --> 00:07:39,700
- I THINK THAT DOESN'’T GIVE ME

203
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,254
THE RIGHT TO STORM OUT
AND LEAVE.

204
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,360
BUT SOMETIMES I THINK
THAT'’S THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS,

205
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,226
AND I JUST DIDN'’T WANT TO ARGUE
IN FRONT OF HER, REALLY.

206
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:49,538
THAT'’S ALL IT WAS,

207
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:52,506
AND I PROBABLY MADE
A WORSE DECISION BY LEAVING.

208
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,059
- WELL, YOU WORK ON THAT,

209
00:07:54,059 --> 00:07:57,787
AND I'’LL WORK
ON MY SNAPPY COMMENTS.

210
00:07:57,787 --> 00:07:59,893
- OKAY, THAT'’S FAIR.

211
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:02,689
- I'’M GLAD YOU'’RE BACK
'’CAUSE I NEED A BREAK.

212
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:07,072
- DON'’T EVER WANT TO BE
AWAY FROM MY ANGEL BABY.

213
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:11,525
- I APPRECIATE ROGER,
YOU KNOW, SAYING HE'’S SORRY.

214
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,734
YOU KNOW, WE'’RE LEARNING,
WE'’RE GROWING AS A COUPLE,

215
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,805
AND I'’M GLAD
BECAUSE I'’M TOTALLY OVER IT,

216
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:18,463
AND I JUST WANT TO MOVE ON
AT THIS POINT.

217
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:20,776
THANK YOU.

218
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,122
- WANT TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
WITH DADDY?

219
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:24,538
DADDY PUT YOU IN YOUR SWING?
- [yawning] HAVE FUN.

220
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,335
- TAKE A NAP.
OKAY?

221
00:08:28,335 --> 00:08:30,475
- UH-HUH.

222
00:08:39,588 --> 00:08:40,520
- SPREAD IT ALL AROUND.

223
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:45,594
- LASAGNA'’S HERE.

224
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:47,492
- WHERE DO YOU WANT TO EAT?

225
00:08:47,492 --> 00:08:49,598
- MY BROTHER, JAMES,

226
00:08:49,598 --> 00:08:50,771
WE ALL PREP FOR DINNER.

227
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:52,324
WE'’RE GETTING READY
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

228
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,878
WE'’RE HAVING ALL FAMILY NIGHT.

229
00:08:53,878 --> 00:08:55,086
THAT THING REALLY
SMELLS LIKE IT'’S BURNING.

230
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:01,541
DAD, OPEN THAT. OPEN THAT UP,
SOMETHING'’S BURNING.

231
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,026
- WHOA, LASAGNA ON FIRE.

232
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:05,337
OH, GOD.

233
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:09,031
- THIS OVEN SUCKS.
- THE FLOUR.

234
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:14,899
- OH, YOU SMELL IT?
P.U.

235
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:17,349
P.U., IT'’S STINKY.

236
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,627
- YOU HAVE TO GET THAT DRIP.

237
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:19,869

[smoke detector goes off]

239
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:22,389
- OH, HERE YOU GO.

240
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:25,012
- LOOK WHAT YOU DID. THERE'’S 10

00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:30,949
- COME ON. OH, THE FIREFIGHTERS

00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:32,364
- REALLY?
- YEAH,

244
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,987
I THOUGHT YOU KNEW HOW TO COOK.

245
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:35,747
- IT'’S YOUR OVEN.
- NO.

246
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,369
- IT'’S YOUR OVEN.

247
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,613
IT WAS DIRTY.

248
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,097
NO, YOU'’RE NOT GOING
IN THERE, PREGNANT.

249
00:09:41,097 --> 00:09:42,651
DON'’T GO IN THERE.
- WHY?

250
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:45,136
- WHAT'’S THAT NOISE?
OH, PYOO. PYOO.

251
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:46,724
- I FEEL LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING

252
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:49,485
I WOULD DO, BECAUSE I DON'’T KNOW
HOW TO COOK, REALLY.

253
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:52,695
BUT JANIS DOING IT, IT'’S LIKE,
I THOUGHT YOU COULD COOK.

254
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,110
- KEEP GOING.
- I DID IT!

255
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,009

[laughs]

257
00:09:58,287 --> 00:09:59,564

- EPIC FAIL.

259
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:02,740

THE LASAGNA.

261
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:07,468

00:10:43,781 --> 00:10:45,334
BECAUSE JANIS TAUGHT ME
HOW TO MAKE IT.

277
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:47,129
I DID IT ALL BY MYSELF,

278
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:49,338
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'’S GOING
TO TASTE REALLY GOOD.

279
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:51,478
HERE'’S MY LASAGNA I MADE.

I'’M IMPRESSED.

289
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:09,530
WE DEFINITELY
WANT TO HAVE DINNERS LIKE THIS.

- OKAY, WHO WANTS
SOME LOBSTER?

303
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:32,761
- YOU SHOULD'’VE SEEN
HOW SHE KILLED IT.

304
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:36,040
THEY WERE ALIVE,
AND SHE STABBED THE HEART.

305
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,835
- REALLY?
- AND THE TAIL WAS FLAPPING.

306
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:39,560
I DON'’T WANT TO TRY THE LOBSTER

307
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,459
JUST BECAUSE I SAW
THAT LOBSTER BEING KILLED.

308
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,738
AS AN ANIMAL LOVER,
IT DOESN'’T SEEM HUMANE TO ME.

309
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,429
IT'’S MURDER.
- MY GOD.

310
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:47,810
- THAT'’S DISGUSTING.

311

- ALL RIGHT, $1,000.

317
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:04,620

00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,623
I'’M SO UNCOMFORTABLE.

00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:40,765
JOEY DECIDED TO SHOW US A VIDEO

510
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:44,459
OF HIM POUTING ON A COUCH
LIKE THIS,

511
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:46,599
WHILE AN ORGY'’S
GOING ON BEHIND HIM.

512
00:19:50,568 --> 00:19:52,674
Nicole: I'’M DYING.
- DON'’T TOUCH ANYTHING.

513
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:53,847
- HE WENT TO BEAR WEEK.

514
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:56,471
AND OF COURSE EVERYBODY
HAS SEX WITH EACH OTHER.

515
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,856
- MY GOD, THAT ONE PART.
- I KNOW.

516
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:04,444
LIKE, WENT IN.
- YEAH.

517
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:06,446
- THAT'’S NOT PROPER TEA TALK.
NOT PROPER TEA TALK.

518
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:09,035
- I'’M SWEATING. SWEATING.

519
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:10,519
- I THINK WE SHOULD PUT--
- AND HE'’S DONE.

520
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,520
- IT AWAY.

521
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,935
- WE'’RE GETTING YELLED AT AGAIN.

522
00:20:12,935 --> 00:20:14,592
- I'’M ACTUALLY A LITTLE
CONCERNED THAT WE'’RE GOING

523
00:20:14,592 --> 00:20:16,732
TO GET KICKED OUT OF HERE
BECAUSE WE ARE

524
00:20:16,732 --> 00:20:20,046
FAR FROM PROPER
AND WE'’RE ASS[bleep].

525
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:22,738
- OH, I'’M JUST A LITTLE HOT.
Jenni: MM-HMM.

526
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:25,465
- WHOO!
- THERE YOU GO, GIRL.

527
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:27,467
- COME ON, YOU'’RE RUINING
THE WHOLE SCENARIO.

528
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:30,677
- I GOT TO AIR IT OUT
A LITTLE BIT.

529
00:20:30,677 --> 00:20:31,920
WHOO-HOO.

530
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,060
- I THINK YOU BEST
PUT IT BACK ON.

531
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,165
PUT IT BACK UP.
- COVER YOUR BOSOMS.

532
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:37,166
- YES.
- OH.

533
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:38,754
- BRING IT UP, THAT'’S IT.

534
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:40,135
- COVER YOUR BREASTICLES.

535
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:42,068
- HAVE YOU BEEN TO A TEA BEFORE?

536
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:43,690
- WE'’VE BEEN
TO A TEA DANCE BEFORE.

537
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,727
THAT'’S A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENT IN OUR CULTURE.

538
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:47,556
A TEA DANCE IS AN AFTERNOON
DANCE PARTY

539
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:50,076
WITH LOTS OF ALCOHOL
AND SHIRTLESS MEN.

540
00:20:50,076 --> 00:20:51,940
- I THOUGHT
YOU MEANT TEA BAGGING.

541
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,700
- NO, I'’VE HAD THAT AS WELL,
BUT THAT'’S IN THE EVENING.

542
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,115
- THAT'’S SOMETHING
MUCH DIFFERENT.

543
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:56,047
- WHAT'’S THAT, AGAIN?

544
00:20:57,394 --> 00:20:59,465
WHERE DO YOU PUT THEM?
- ON YOUR FACE.

545
00:20:59,465 --> 00:21:01,846
- THAT'’S NOT PROPER TEA TALK.
NOT PROPER TEA TALK.

546
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:04,608
- THIS IS A LITTLE GAME WE LIKE
TO PLAY IN THE GAY COMMUNITY.

547
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:06,920
OKAY, GIRL, ASSUME THE POSITION.

548
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,718
PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH.
CHEW IT, NOW SWALLOW.

549
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:12,961
SEE?

550
00:21:12,961 --> 00:21:15,135
- WE'’LL HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO RETURN TO YOUR SEAT.

551
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,482
- SLUTS.
- YEAH, SERIOUSLY.

552
00:21:16,482 --> 00:21:18,346
- PLEASE, DON'’T DO
ANY MORE OF THOSE.

553
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:20,209
- I'’M SORRY.

554
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:23,351
- WE WOULD NOT FIT IN,
IN THE VICTORIAN SOCIETY.

555
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:25,905
I FEEL LIKE WE WOULD BE
THE DRUNK, AND THE WHORE.

556
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:29,046
- I WAS GOING TO SAY
THE SAME THING.

557
00:21:29,046 --> 00:21:30,530
WHO'’S THE DRUNK
AND WHO'’S THE WHORE?

558
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,911
- I'’M THE DRUNK,
YOU'’RE THE WHORE.

559
00:21:31,911 --> 00:21:34,051
- OH, COOL.
- YOU GOT FAKE BOOBS, SO.

560
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:36,225
- THIS IS A LOT OF WORK.
- WHAT?

561
00:21:36,225 --> 00:21:37,848
- BEING PROPER.

562
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,090
- I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO POOP.

563
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,229
- NOT PROPER TEA TALK.

564
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,549
- I HAVE AN IDEA
WHAT WE COULD DO TODAY.

565
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:50,757
- WHAT?
- I WAS THINKING,

566
00:21:50,757 --> 00:21:51,896
FOR OUR NEW HOUSE,

567
00:21:51,896 --> 00:21:53,864
SINCE WE WANT TO DO GARDENS
AND STUFF...

568
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:56,176
- YEAH.
- WHY DON'’T WE PRACTICE HERE?

569
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:58,558
AND IF WE MESS UP,
WE MESS UP AND IT'’S HERE.

570
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,320
- THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT
A GARDEN IS MAINTAINING IT.

571
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,323
YOU'’VE NEVER SLAVED IN THERE.
I'’VE DONE IT FOR YEARS.

572
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,221
- I USED TO GARDEN WITH MY MOM.

573
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:08,706
IT'’S GARDEN WARS.

574
00:22:08,706 --> 00:22:11,122
- LET'’S START THIS [bleep]
- LET'’S GO GET OUR GARDEN ON.

575
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,539
- OKAY.

576
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:16,058
NICOLE AND I ARE GOING
TO MAKE TWO SEPARATE GARDENS.

577
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:18,129
WE'’RE GOING TO HAVE
A LITTLE GARDEN WAR.

578
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,510
- GARDEN WARS,
2014.

579
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,513
- AND WE'’RE GOING TO SEE
WHOSE GARDEN IS BETTER.

580
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:25,274
- IT'’S A COMPETITION.
WE'’RE NOT FRIENDS.

581
00:22:25,274 --> 00:22:26,897
- AT GARDEN WARS, YOU
DON'’T TALK ABOUT GARDEN WARS.

582
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:31,591
- YEAH, AND AT GARDEN WARS,
WE HAVE TO KISS EACH OTHER.

583
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:34,145
- HOPE YOUR EYELASHES DON'’T
FALL OFF WHILE WE'’RE DIGGING.

584
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,078
- YOU'’RE SO ANNOYING.
- HELLO.

585
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:39,392
HEY.
- CARLY'’S HERE!

586
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:40,807
BABE, YOU READY?

587
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:42,533
WE'’RE GOING TO GO GET
SOME FLOWERS AND VEGETABLES.

588
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:44,017
- OKAY.

589
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:47,366
Jionni: GARDEN WARS.
- IT'’S ON LIKE DONKEY KONG.

590
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,610
I'’M DOING FRUIT, YOU DO VEGGIES.

591
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:55,063
- DON'’T COME LOOKING FOR ME--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

592
00:22:55,063 --> 00:22:56,789
- DON'’T COME LOOKING FOR YOU?

593
00:22:56,789 --> 00:22:58,446
- WHY DID YOU JUST DO THAT
WHILE I WAS TALKING?

594
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:01,034
- '’CAUSE YOU, LIKE, STUTTERED.
- NO, I DIDN'’T.

595
00:23:01,034 --> 00:23:03,761
DON'’T FOLLOW ME AND SAY, "OH,
LET ME SEE WHAT HE'’S GETTING."

596
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:06,868
- I DON'’T WANT TO FOLLOW YOU.
WE'’RE NOT FRIENDS RIGHT NOW.

597
00:23:06,868 --> 00:23:10,768
OH, I REALLY HAVE TO POOP.
SHOULD I HOLD IT?

598
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:12,252
SHOULD I HOLD IT?
- I DON'’T KNOW.

599
00:23:13,702 --> 00:23:15,152
- OOH, I'’M GOING TO USE THIS.

600
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:16,567
- WHY DO YOU GET THE BIG ONE?

601
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:18,224
- YOU WANT THE BIG ONE?
- YEAH.

602
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:20,744
- ACTUALLY, NO. IT'’S A WAR.

603
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:23,229
- SEE YOU, LOSER.

604
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:24,575
- I THINK I'’M GOING TO WIN.

605
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:26,474
NICOLE'’S PREGNANT,
SHE'’S SLACKING, AND...

606
00:23:26,474 --> 00:23:28,407
- THAT'’S SO RUDE.
- I THINK I'’M GOING TO TAKE...

607
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,236
- LIKE, THAT'’S YOUR BABY.
- THE W.

608
00:23:30,236 --> 00:23:32,100
- WHAT YOU JUST SAID
SOUNDED VERY RUDE.

609
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,170
- OH, '’CAUSE IT'’S GARDEN WARS.

610
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:38,589
- A BUTTERFLY.

611
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,629
- OH, MY GOD.

612
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:45,493
- I THINK THERE'’S SPIDERS.

613
00:23:45,493 --> 00:23:47,874
STAY ON YOUR SIDE.

614
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:49,600
- WHAT?
- THIS IS MY SIDE.

615
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,601
- COME ON.

616
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:54,847
- TWO, FOUR, WHAT'’S THE BLACK?

617
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:55,882
- OH!

618
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:57,505
- I SHOULD BE A GARDENIST.

619
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:59,645
- GET OUT OF HERE.

620
00:23:59,645 --> 00:24:01,405
- SQUIRREL!

621
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:04,304
- ARE THESE GOOD FLOWERS
FOR A GARDEN?

622
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:05,789
- NO CHEATING.

623
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:06,859
JIONNI'’S CHEATING.

624
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:08,067
HE'’S ASKING THIS GIRL...

625
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:09,413
- I'’M ASKING
THE PROFESSIONAL GARDENER...

626
00:24:09,413 --> 00:24:10,552
- WHAT FLOWERS ARE BETTER
IN THE SUN.

627
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:11,898
- I'’M ASKING
THE PROFESSIONAL GARDENER.

628
00:24:11,898 --> 00:24:13,003
- YEAH, BUT ON THE WAY THERE

629
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:15,177
I SAID YOU CAN'’T ASK
THE FLORIST.

630
00:24:15,177 --> 00:24:16,385
- FROM WHAT I SEE YOU HAVE--

631
00:24:16,385 --> 00:24:18,836
YOU DEFINITELY
SHOULD BE ASKING QUESTIONS.

632
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:20,148
I'’M READY.

633
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:21,563
- YOU DON'’T REALLY HAVE A THEME.

634
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:22,564
WHAT'’S YOUR THEME?

635
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:24,290
- HOW DO I NOT HAVE A THEME?

636
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,636
THE THEME IS THIS.
- THE COLORS. I LIKE--

637
00:24:25,636 --> 00:24:26,982
- THIS IS CALLED PANDORA.

638
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,019
- YOU'’RE NOT FROM AVATAR.
- THIS IS FOR AVATARS.

639
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:30,330
THIS IS AN ALIEN GARDEN.

640
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,125
- OKAY, WELL YOU DO YOUR GARDEN,
I'’LL DO MINE.

641
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:33,230
- OKAY.

642
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,645
I FEEL LIKE I...

643
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:36,647
- I DEFINITELY PICKED OUT...
both: THE BETTER FLOWERS--

644
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:38,856
- YOU HAD--
THEY WEREN'’T EVEN FLOWERS.

645
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:40,720
- THEY'’RE FLOWERS.
- THEY WERE LEAVES.

646
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,584
- THEY WERE FLOWERS.
- OKAY.

647
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,862
LET'’S SEE HOW GOOD
YOU MAKE A GARDEN.

648
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:46,726
- OKAY, I'’M NOT SCARED.

649
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:49,246
- YOU SHOULD BE SCARED.

650
00:24:57,357 --> 00:24:58,911
WHAT DID I GET?

651
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:00,084
- THOSE ARE MINE.
JUST CARRY YOURS.

652
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,361
- THOSE ARE NOT.
- THOSE ARE MINE.

653
00:25:01,361 --> 00:25:02,466
- NOPE.
- DON'’T MESS WITH ME.

654
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:05,227
both: I'’M GOING
TO WIN GARDEN WARS.

655
00:25:05,227 --> 00:25:06,677
- I'’M GOING TO WIN GARDEN WARS.

656
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:08,541
- I KNOW I'’M GOING TO WIN
GARDEN WARS.

657
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,853
SO, I DON'’T GOT TO KEEP
SHOUTING IT TO MYSELF.

658
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:12,131
- I'’M GOING TO WIN GARDEN WARS!

659
00:25:12,131 --> 00:25:13,270
- KILLED IT.
- NO, I DIDN'’T.

660
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,720
- YEAH, YOU DID.

661
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,687
DO YOU WANT THEM RIGHT NEXT
TO EACH OTHER OR SPREAD OUT?

662
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:18,275
- SPREAD OUT.

663
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:21,002
I DON'’T WANT MY FLOWERS TOUCHING
YOUR UGLY FLOWERS.

664
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:22,210
WHAT?

665
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,452
- THIS IS GOING TO BE
A TOUGH COMPETITION.

666
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:24,799
I CAN FEEL IT ALREADY.

667
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,422
- I HAVE A DISADVANTAGE HERE,
I'’M PREGNANT.

668
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:29,355
LOSER.

669
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,086
[laughs]

670
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:38,191
- I SAW THAT.

671
00:25:38,191 --> 00:25:39,468
YOU CHEATED.

672
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:42,368
- I DIDN'’T TOUCH YOUR PLANTS.
- OH, NO?

673
00:25:42,368 --> 00:25:47,062
I WATCHED YOU GO TO MY PLANT
AND KNOCK IT OVER.

674
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:49,444

TO TRY ON A DRESS.

844
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:36,678
BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE
I EAT LIGHT, BECAUSE--

845
00:32:36,678 --> 00:32:38,577
- YOU'’LL BE FINE.
EAT WHAT YOU WANT.

846
00:32:38,577 --> 00:32:41,097
YOU SHOULD GET A MARGARITA,
LIKE YOU'’VE BEEN CRAVING.

847
00:32:41,097 --> 00:32:43,340
YOU'’VE BEEN CRAVING A MARGARITA
THIS WHOLE TIME.

848
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,308
- [burps] NO, JUST TEQUILA.

849
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:47,310
- THEN GET TEQUILA.

850
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,865
- IT'’S NOT LIKE I WOULD DRINK
LIKE THE OLD DAYS, ANYWAYS.

851
00:32:50,865 --> 00:32:53,799
- IF I COULD DRINK, I WOULD HAVE
A NICE GLASS OF RED WINE.

852
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,147
- MM, RIGHT, LIKE HEY!
- RED GETS ME CHILL DRUNK.

853
00:32:57,147 --> 00:32:58,424
- YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT PASSING OUT...

854
00:32:58,424 --> 00:32:59,632
- AND HORNY.

855
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:03,153
- I AM PETRIFIED OF HAVING SEX.
- OH, YEAH.

856
00:33:03,153 --> 00:33:06,329
I DIDN'’T HAVE SEX '’TILL,
LIKE, TWO, THREE MONTHS AFTER.

857
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:08,296
SEX AFTER GIVING BIRTH HURTS.

858
00:33:08,296 --> 00:33:10,505
AND IT'’S REALLY NEVER
THE SAME AGAIN.

859
00:33:10,505 --> 00:33:11,817
- NO.
- YEAH.

860
00:33:11,817 --> 00:33:14,164
- AND NOT IN A GOOD WAY.
- NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

861
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:16,166
WHOO!
- [laughs]

862
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:18,720
HELLO, LADIES.
ALL: HI.

863
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,171
- HEY, GIRL.

864
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:22,552
- JENNI, YOU LOOK PHENOMENAL.
- THANK YOU.

865
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:25,003
- OH, MY GOD.

866
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,866
- I'’M GLAD A MAJORITY
OF THE SWELLING WENT DOWN.

867
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:27,971
- RIGHT HERE?

868
00:33:27,971 --> 00:33:29,421
WE GET TO CITY CELLAR

869
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:31,078
AND AMY, DEENA,
AND SAM ARE ALREADY HERE.

870
00:33:31,078 --> 00:33:34,495
- I'’M JUST STUPID EXCITED
THAT I CAN HAVE A DRINK.

871
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:37,015
- GET YOUR MARGARITA.
- MM.

872
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:38,568
I'’VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MARGARITA

873
00:33:38,568 --> 00:33:39,569
FOR, LIKE, A YEAR.

874
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:41,433
- OH, YOU CAN DRINK NOW.
- YEAH.

875
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:44,919
I'’M GOING TO HAVE
THE ULTIMATE MARGARITA.

876
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:46,403
- YEAH!

877
00:33:46,403 --> 00:33:47,508
- LOOKS GOOD.
- I'’M DRIVING.

878
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:48,992
- I WAITED TEN MONTHS FOR THIS.

879
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:51,270
IT'’S NOT EVEN
THAT I MISS GETTING DRUNK.

880
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,445
I JUST MISS THE FACT THAT,
LIKE--

881
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:56,034
I JUST DON'’T LIKE WHEN SOMEONE
SAYS YOU CAN'’T DO SOMETHING.

882
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,104
- OH.

883
00:33:57,104 --> 00:33:58,622
- THAT LOOKS SO GOOD.
- THANK YOU.

884
00:33:58,622 --> 00:34:00,728
- THAT'’S WHAT PISSES ME OFF.
- THEN YOU WANT TO DO IT, YEAH.

885
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:03,282
- SO, CHEERS.
all: CHEERS.

886
00:34:03,282 --> 00:34:04,490
- TO WEDDINGS.

887
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:07,459
- BABIES AND WEDDINGS!
- BABIES AND WEDDINGS.

888
00:34:07,459 --> 00:34:08,943
- YAY.

889
00:34:08,943 --> 00:34:10,910
CHEERS TO JENNI'’S DRINK.
- CHEERS TO JENNI.

890
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,015
- COOL.

891
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:14,569
MY FIRST MARGARITA
IS REALLY STRONG.

892
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:21,300
AND REALLY SALTY.

893
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,853
- WINE IS SO MUCH MORE SMOOTH.

894
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,165
- HUH?

895
00:34:24,165 --> 00:34:25,580
- YOU SHOULD'’VE JUST WENT
WITH, LIKE, WINE.

896
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,341
- I'’M HAVING LIKE FOUR SIPS
AND I'’M ALREADY DRUNK.

897
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:28,445
- AND YOU'’RE BOMBED.
- YEAH.

898
00:34:28,445 --> 00:34:30,275
- DRINK.
[laughs]

899
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:31,931
- ARE YOU GOING TO DO
THAT EVERY SIP?

900
00:34:31,931 --> 00:34:33,623
- IT'’S BEEN A WHILE.

901
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:36,833
ONE MORE.
- OH, SHE'’S GOING TO GET BOMBED.

902
00:34:36,833 --> 00:34:38,869
- SHE'’S GOING TO BE ROLLING
AROUND IN THE DRESS PLACE.

903
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:43,391
- JELLY.
- MY EYES ARE [bleep] CROSSING.

904
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,394
- SHOW ME ALL THE PICTURES.

905
00:34:46,394 --> 00:34:47,913
SHOW ME ALL THE PICTURES,
JENNI.

906
00:34:47,913 --> 00:34:50,743
- HERE'’S A COUPLE.
- AW.

907
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:52,400
- WAIT, SHE WAS SLEEPING
ON THE SIDE OF HER?

908
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,264
- SHE'’S SUCH A LITTLE,
LIKE, A LITTLE PEA.

909
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:55,610
- SHE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE YOU,
HERE.

910
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,956
- I KNOW, SHE'’S GETTING
TO LOOK LIKE ME.

911
00:34:56,956 --> 00:34:58,544
- STARTING TO.
- HOW WAS IT?

912
00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:00,788
- IT'’S NOT THAT BAD.
LOOK, IT'’S ALREADY OVER WITH.

913
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:02,686
- YOU SAID IT WASN'’T BAD.
DID YOU GET THE DRUGS?

914
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:05,310
- MY LABOR WAS
[bleep] GOD AWFUL.

915
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,070
I FELT EVERYTHING.
- THE DRUGS DIDN'’T WORK?

916
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,865
- SHE FELT HER VAGINA RIP.

917
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:10,832
- OH, MY GOD.
BUT THAT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

918
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:15,285
- HER HEAD WAS OUT, LIKE,
POKING WHEN MY DOCTOR WALKED IN.

919
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:18,806
RIPPED RIGHT THROUGH,
LIKE SHE CAME OUT,

920
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:22,016
LIKE A [bleep],
LIKE, WATERSLIDE PARK RIDE.

921
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:25,675
LIKE, JUST FLEW OUT OF ME.

922
00:35:25,675 --> 00:35:26,848
I'’M DRUNK.

923
00:35:28,643 --> 00:35:30,852
I AM DRUNK. I'’M HONESTLY
REALLY DRUNK RIGHT NOW.

924
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:32,716
I'’M, LIKE, DIZZY.

925
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,062
- YEAH.

926
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:35,754
LET'’S GET DRUNK TONIGHT.

927
00:35:35,754 --> 00:35:37,583
- WOW, I NEED TO EAT
'’CAUSE THE ROOM'’S SPINNING.

928
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:40,517
I THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING
THE QUINOA.

929
00:35:40,517 --> 00:35:42,761
- I'’M GETTING THAT ONE, TOO.
- YEAH, THAT'’S WHAT I'’M GETTING.

930
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:45,039
- WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT IS IT CALLED?

931
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,074
- QUINOA.
- QUINOA?

932
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:48,249
- YEAH.
- OH, WAIT.

933
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:50,907
IS THAT LIKE ASIAN FUSION?

934
00:35:50,907 --> 00:35:52,564
- NO, IT'’S LIKE RICE.

935
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:53,737
- OH, OKAY.

936
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:56,809
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO,
I DON'’T WANT THAT.

937
00:35:56,809 --> 00:35:58,466
"KENNY?" WHAT IS IT CALLED?

938
00:35:58,466 --> 00:35:59,985
- SHE GOES,
"IS IT ASIAN FUSION?"

939
00:35:59,985 --> 00:36:01,745
'’CAUSE WE'’RE LIKE, QUINOA.

940
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:05,093
- OH.
IT'’S LIKE COUSCOUS.

941
00:36:05,093 --> 00:36:07,165
- OH, I DON'’T EAT THAT.
- RIGHT, IT LOOKS LIKE THAT.

942
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,890
IT'’S LIKE A PROTEIN, YEAH.

943
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,202
OH, ASIAN FUSION?

944
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,618
- BUT DOESN'’T IT SOUND IT?

945
00:36:12,618 --> 00:36:14,033
- ASIAN FUSION IS--I DON'’T KNOW.

946
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:16,450
YOU FUSE
A LOT OF ASIANS TOGETHER.

947
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,693
I DON'’T [bleep] KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU?

948
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:20,039
QUINOA?

949
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:22,283
- I'’M GOING TO ASK
IF I CAN GET THAT WITH LETTUCE.

950
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:24,423
- OH, MY GOD.

951
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:26,632
FINALLY.

00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:43,649

00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:45,686

962
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:47,412
I'’M DOING SOMETHING CUTE.

00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:49,897
I CAN'’T WAIT FOR THE BRIDESMAIDS
TO SEE THE DRESSES,

964
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:51,899
BECAUSE I'’M GOING TO PUT THEM
IN HIDEOUS ONES,

965
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:53,418
AND THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'’RE IN FOR.

966
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:54,660
ARE YOU GUYS

967
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:55,834

WHY ARE YOU WALKING LIKE THAT?

971
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,117

973
00:37:04,601 --> 00:37:07,190

00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:31,145

00:37:41,431 --> 00:37:42,950
JESSICA'’S BRINGING ME

989
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,814

OKAY? IT'’S GORGEOUS.

00:38:12,048 --> 00:38:14,982

1002
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:16,915
- I GOT A LINEUP OVER HERE.

1003
00:38:16,915 --> 00:38:21,057

- IT DOESN'’T EVEN FIT.

1008
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:32,896
- EW, NICOLE.
THIS IS MORE LIKE DEENA.

1009
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:34,104
CAN WE TRADE?

1010
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,416
- HOW BAD ARE YOURS?

1011
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:36,831
- I FEEL LIKE I LOOK
LIKE AN APRON.

1012
00:38:36,831 --> 00:38:40,007
- THIS IS HORRIBLE.
- GOD, I STINK.

1013
00:38:40,007 --> 00:38:41,836
- I LOOK LIKE AN OLD LADY.

1014
00:38:41,836 --> 00:38:44,701
- OKAY, RUNWAY SHOW!

1015
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:46,600
OH, MY GOD.

1016
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,429
- HOW DO YOU--
HOW DO YOU WORK IT IN THIS?

1017
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:50,051
- YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.

1018
00:38:50,051 --> 00:38:52,088
- I FEEL SO DUMPY RIGHT NOW.

1019
00:38:52,088 --> 00:38:54,884
NICOLE PUT ME IN A [bleep]
FRUMPY ASS DRESS RIGHT NOW.

1020
00:38:54,884 --> 00:38:56,989
I DON'’T KNOW
WHAT GAME SHE'’S PLAYING,

1021
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:59,578
BUT I LOOK LIKE A LESBIAN

1022
00:38:59,578 --> 00:39:00,855
THAT HASN'’T COME OUT
OF THE CLOSET YET

1023
00:39:00,855 --> 00:39:01,856
THAT'’S AT PROM.

1024
00:39:01,856 --> 00:39:03,237
- YOU LOOK GREAT.

1025
00:39:03,237 --> 00:39:04,445
[all laugh]

1026
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:06,965
OKAY, FRANKIE!
- OOH!

1027
00:39:06,965 --> 00:39:08,518
[imitate retching]

1028
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:09,761
THAT'’S A THROW UP DRESS.

1029
00:39:09,761 --> 00:39:11,176
COME ON, DEENA!

1030
00:39:11,176 --> 00:39:14,835
WHOA!
[all laugh]

1031
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:18,701
- THIS IS NOT GATSBY.
THIS IS TRASHY.

1032
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:21,462
- OKAY, SAMMY!

1033
00:39:21,462 --> 00:39:23,326
- SAMMY LOOKS LIKE
A [bleep] BALLERINA.

1034
00:39:23,326 --> 00:39:24,327
IT'’S GROSS.

1035
00:39:24,327 --> 00:39:25,570
- OOH!

1036
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:28,296
- AND MAID OF HONOR STEPHANIE.

1037
00:39:28,296 --> 00:39:29,574
YAY! YAY! YAY!

1038
00:39:29,574 --> 00:39:31,092
WHICH ONE WOULD YOU GUYS
LOVE TO WEAR AT MY WEDDING?

1039
00:39:31,092 --> 00:39:32,542
- HOW ABOUT THIS?

1040
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:35,269
- I DEFINITELY THINK THE GIRLS
ARE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED

1041
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:36,650
WITH THE BRIDESMAID'’S DRESSES.

1042
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,756
- I FEEL LIKE THESE DRESSES
DON'’T FEEL VERY GATSBY.

1043
00:39:39,756 --> 00:39:42,794
THEY FEEL LIKE PROM NIGHT
DUMPSTER BABY.

1044
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:47,385
- ALL THESE DRESSES ARE REALLY,
REALLY CUTE, I THINK.

1045
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,387
- ARE THEY?
- THEY'’RE ALL ADORABLE.

1046
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:52,286
BUT I ACTUALLY
HAVE YOUR REAL DRESSES HERE.

1047
00:39:52,286 --> 00:39:53,667
- OH, YOU DO?
- YES.

1048
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:55,841
- THANK GOD.

1049
00:39:55,841 --> 00:40:00,812
- [clapping] YAY!
DO YOU GUYS LOVE IT?

1050
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:02,503
- I LOVE IT.
- ISN'’T IT FLATTERING?

1051
00:40:02,503 --> 00:40:04,160
- IT'’S VERY FLATTERING.
- I LOVE IT.

1052
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,403
I LOVE THAT DRESS, RIGHT?

1053
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,576
AND IT JUST MAKES YOU
LOOK LIKE--

1054
00:40:06,576 --> 00:40:07,681
- TIGHT.

1055
00:40:07,681 --> 00:40:09,648
- SO MUCH BETTER
THAN MY MUSTARD.

1056
00:40:09,648 --> 00:40:11,098
- THE GOWN IS STUNNING.

1057
00:40:11,098 --> 00:40:12,582
- IT LOOKS GOOD ON ANYBODY,
IT'’S JUST...

1058
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:13,825
- IT'’S VERY GATSBY.

1059
00:40:13,825 --> 00:40:15,654
- IT'’S SWEETHEART CUT,
IT'’S TIGHT

1060
00:40:15,654 --> 00:40:18,657
TO SHOW EVERYBODY'’S CURVES,
'’CAUSE EVERYBODY'’S DIFFERENT.

1061
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:20,866
AND THEN IT COMES OUT,
KIND OF LIKE A MERMAID DRESS,

1062
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:22,765
ESPECIALLY WITH THE BOW.
- MM-HMM.

1063
00:40:22,765 --> 00:40:24,629
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, GUYS,
FOR COMING. I LOVE YOU ALL.

1064
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:26,009
- THANK YOU.
- GROUP HUG.

1065
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:27,114
- BYE.
- THANK YOU.

1066
00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:28,218
- I CAN'’T WAIT TO GET MARRIED.

1067
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,704
- YAY!
- WHOO!

1068
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:32,291
- I'’M SO GLAD
ALL MY GIRLS CAME OUT,

1069
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:33,776
AND THEY APPROVED OF THE DRESS,

1070
00:40:33,776 --> 00:40:36,503
AND NOW WE HAVE ANOTHER THING
OFF OF OUR WEDDING LIST.

1071
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:38,919
WE'’RE ONE STEP CLOSER,

1072
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:41,715
AND I AM READY
TO BE MRS. LAVALLE.

1073
00:40:41,715 --> 00:40:43,682
all: GO, GATSBY WEDDING!

1074
00:40:43,682 --> 00:40:44,821
- [laughs]

1075
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:46,029
- YAY!
- ARE YOU EXCITED, NOW?

1076
00:40:48,722 --> 00:40:49,930
- NEXT TIME ON...
- SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW...

1077
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,484
- I'’VE NEVER SEEN A BABY
EAT THAT MUCH EVER.

1078
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:54,900
WELL, EXCEPT FOR MAYBE YOU.
[laughter]

1079
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,247
- I HAD ROLLS.
- LIKE A LITTLE SUMO WRESTLER.

1080
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,559
- WE GOT TO LEAVE TONIGHT.

1081
00:40:58,559 --> 00:40:59,905
IT WAS AN AWESOME SUMMER.

1082
00:40:59,905 --> 00:41:01,631
NOW IT'’S TIME TO GO BACK
TO THE BASEMENT.

1083
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:03,737
MUAH.
all: AW.

1084
00:41:03,737 --> 00:41:04,910
- GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

1085
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:07,223
♪ BABY JESUS
- OH, MY GOD.
