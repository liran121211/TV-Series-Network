00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,912
- JUST ROCK HER A LITTLE BIT,
SHE'LL STOP.

174
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,515
- IT'S OKAY.

175
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,383
- YOU LOOK TERRIFIED.
- I AM.

176
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:57,985
- IT'S MAYBE A TAD MORE SPECIAL

177
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,821
FOR YOUR DAD, BECAUSE MY DAD
IS ALREADY A GRANDFATHER.

178
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:03,390
I HAVE A NIECE, BUT YOUR DAD
IS A FIRST-TIME GRANDPA,

179
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,358
AND YOU CAN JUST SEE IN HIS EYES

180
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,661
THAT HE'S--HE'S TERRIFIED.
- SO NERVOUS.

181
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,663
- I CAN'T BELIEVE--

182
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:14,968
I DIDN'T THINK THIS GUY WAS EVER
GONNA GIVE ME ONE OF THESE, HUH?

183
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,671
BUT IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT,
YEAH.

184
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,841
- SEEING MY DAD HOLD MEILANI,
IT'S A LITTLE SURREAL, YOU KNOW?

185
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,310
IT'S SOMETHING I KNOW MY FATHER
DIDN'T THINK WOULD HAPPEN,

186
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,812
SO I'M JUST KIND
OF SITTING BACK AND BASKING

187
00:07:24,912 --> 00:07:26,847
IN THE GLORY OF WATCHING
THAT ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

188
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:30,718
I KNOW MY FATHER
IS ON CLOUD NINE RIGHT NOW.

189
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:34,655
I KNOW HE'S JUST A PROUD GRANDPA
AND COULDN'T BE HAPPIER FOR US.

190
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,624
- SHE'S GONNA BE PRETTY
LIKE HER MOM.

191
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,526
- SHE'S JUST PERFECT.
- SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.

192
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,761
- JUST PERFECT.
- JUST BEAUTIFUL.

193
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,563
- I THINK THIS LITTLE ONE
IS A KEEPER.

194
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,666
- AND IT WAS SO EASY,
WE EXPECT FIVE OR SIX MORE.

195
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:47,535
[laughter]

196
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:52,072
- I'LL UPDATE EVERYBODY
ON HOW YOU'RE DOING.

197
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:55,342
- MM-HMM.

198
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,911
- TEXTING NICOLE RIGHT NOW.

199
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:03,617
[phone beeps]
- OH, MY GOD, I'M SO EXCITED.

200
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:06,787
- YOU.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

201
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,556
- I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM ROGER,

202
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,558
AND JENNI HAD MEILANI,

203
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:13,561
AND I CANNOT WAIT TO MEET HER.
- HELLO?

204
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,896
- HEY, CAR.
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

205
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,999
- CAN YOU COME OVER RIGHT NOW
BECAUSE JENNI JUST HAD HER BABY,

206
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,300
AND I NEED TO GO SEE HER.

207
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,569
- OH, YAY!
- YEAH, SO--

208
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:22,603
- I'M READY TO GO,
BE RIGHT THERE.

209
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,572
- ALL RIGHT, BE HERE IN,
LIKE, TWO SECONDS.

210
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,906
- COOL, I'M ON MY WAY RIGHT NOW.

211
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,309
- OKAY, BYE.
- BYE.

212
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:30,711
- I'M SO EXCITED.

213
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,713
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE
WHAT THIS BABY LOOKS LIKE.

214
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:36,750
I'M PICTURING A BIG TURKEY BABY,
LIKE A TEN-POUNDER

215
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,686
WITH BIG ROLLS.

216
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,788
I JUST LITERALLY WANT TO RUN
TO THE HOSPITAL

217
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,455
AND MEET THIS BABY.

218
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,391
ARE YOU EXCITED?
- MM-HMM.

219
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,493
- WE'RE GONNA
MEET HER CHILD RIGHT NOW.

220
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,962
WONDER IF ROGER CRIED.

221
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:01,408
- [chuckling]

222
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:05,045
I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING.

223
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,047
- IS SHE JUST BEING A LOVE BUG?

224
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,516
- SHE'S JUST BEING PERFECT.

225
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:11,619
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL.

226
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:20,427
I LOVE IT
WHEN SHE MAKES NOISES.

227
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:23,931
- WANT TO SEE YOUR AUNTIE
SOON?

228
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,833
both: COME IN.

229
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,904
- HELLO.
- IT'S THE AUNTIE AND UNCLE.

230
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,873
- BABY!

231
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,743
- SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

232
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:37,945
OH, MY GOODNESS.

233
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,681
SHE'S SO SMALL.

234
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:41,715
I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD."

235
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,717
I SEE THIS LITTLE NUGGET

236
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:47,120
WITH A LOT
OF HAIR IN A PINK OUTFIT,

237
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,890
AND IT'S JENNI'S BABY.

238
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,995
AND SHE'S NOT A GINGER
LIKE I THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE.

239
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,463
- HOW LONG, HOW HEAVY?

240
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,065
- SHE WAS 20 1/2 INCHES LONG.

241
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,700
SHE WAS 7 POUNDS, 13 OUNCES

242
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,601
AND SHE WAS BORN AT 12:59?
- NOT BAD.

243
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,403
- NO, 49.
- 12:49.

244
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:04,672
- 12:49.
- SHE CAME RIGHT OUT.

245
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:06,774
- FROM THE TIME
HER WATER BROKE TO THE TIME

246
00:10:06,874 --> 00:10:08,408
SHE WAS OUT, 3 1/2 HOURS.

247
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:09,710
THAT'S FAST.
- YEAH.

248
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,880
- DUDE, SHE CAME SO QUICKLY,
MY EPIDURAL FAILED ME.

249
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,614
- YOU DIDN'T--
YOU FELT EVERYTHING?

250
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,049
- IF YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SCREAMING,

251
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,484
I WAS SCREAMING SO LOUD.

252
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,886
- LIKE IN THE MOVIES?
- YES.

253
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,021
I WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING
TO PASS OUT FROM THIS PAIN."

254
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,522
SHE WAS--
- YOU FELT EVERYTHING?

255
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,924
- EVERY--I
LOOKED HIM IN THE FACE

256
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,659
AND I WAS LIKE,

257
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,960
"I'M GONNA PASS OUT."

258
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,030
MY VAGINA IS IN SO MUCH PAIN,

259
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,699
I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN TO YOU,
AND THE FACT--

260
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,002
- IT HASN'T HURT
LIKE THAT SINCE COLLEGE.

261
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:38,638
- SO RUDE.
IT'S TRUE, THOUGH.

262
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,373
- WHAT'D IT FEEL LIKE?

263
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,675
- I--I CAN'T EVEN
EXPLAIN THE PAIN.

264
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,010
- SHE WENT FROM, IN AN HOUR,

265
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,345
BLUSHING WHEN SHE SAID
"FRIG" IN FRONT OF OUR DOCTOR

266
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,479
TO SCREAMING AT HIM,

267
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:51,384
"IS MY [bleep] FALLING OUT?"

268
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:03,096
- OH, HOLD HER, HERE.
- YEAH, HOLD HER, BABE.

269
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,297
- CAN I?
- YEAH.

270
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,465
- SHE'S SO CUTE.

271
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,200
I SEE ROGER RIGHT NOW.
- SO DO I.

272
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,037
- I SEE A LITTLE BIT,
BUT I SEE JENNI, TOO.

273
00:11:10,137 --> 00:11:11,939
I DON'T THINK SHE'S REALLY
FIGURED OUT WHO SHE'S GONNA LOOK

274
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,875
LIKE YET.
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

275
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:17,244
WE WERE SCARED YOU WERE GONNA
BE UGLY, BUT YOU'RE NOT UGLY.

276
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,345
- NO, SHE'S SO CUTE.
- SHE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE

277
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,080
THAT BAD OF A CONE HEAD
FOR GETTING STUCK.

278
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,448
- SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.
- YEAH, MAN.

279
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,050
- I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU
HAD AN UGLY BABY, TRUST ME.

280
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,517
- THANK YOU.
- I'D BE LIKE, "UM,

281
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,286
THAT'S NOT YOUR BABY."
- YOU'RE AVOIDING THE FACE--

282
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:28,188
- BUT I COULD SEE EVERYTHING.

283
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,090
- YOU SAW THE--
YOU SAW HER VAGINA?

284
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,224
- OH, YEAH, I SAW EVERYTHING.
- THE BABY COMING OUT?

285
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,392
- YEAH, I SAW THE HEAD
COMING OUT.

286
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:33,393
I SAW EVERYTHING, YEAH.

287
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:37,097
I SAW, UH, I SAW A LOT.
UM--

288
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,466
- I STILL WANT TO KNOW WHAT
YOUR VISION IS OF WHAT HAPPENED,

289
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,101
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE.

290
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:45,438
- IT'S JUST--IT'S ALMOST
INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO--

291
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,240
- WILL YOU STILL HAVE SEX
WITH ME?

292
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,776
- YES.
- WELL, WE'RE GONNA

293
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:49,910
LET YOU GUYS GO,
'CAUSE IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

294
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,011
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

295
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,212
WE ENJOYED SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU.

296
00:11:52,312 --> 00:11:53,781
- MAYBE I COULD COME BY
TOMORROW.

297
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:56,183
- I WOULD LOVE THAT.
- VISITING HOURS ARE OVER,

298
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,852
AND WE DEFINITELY WANT TO GIVE
ROGER AND JENNI SOME REST

299
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,588
BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY KNOW
HOW TIRING IT IS

300
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,623
TO HAVE THE BABY
FOR THE FIRST DAY.

301
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,993
- THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT GONNA
GET SLEEP TONIGHT, TOMORROW,

302
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:07,327
OR THE WHOLE WEEK.
- NOPE.

303
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:09,096
OR THEIR WHOLE LIFE.
- EVER.

304
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,330
- EVER.

305
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,399
ENJOY THE BABY.
- THANK YOU.

306
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:13,400
- I'M SO PROUD OF YOU GUYS.

307
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,169
- THANK YOU.

308
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:20,140
- OH, I CAN'T WAIT
TO HAVE A LITTLE BABY NOW.

309
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,475
I REMEMBER HAVING LORENZO
IN THE HOSPITAL,

310
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,278
AND I LOVED GETTING VISITORS
BECAUSE IT TOOK YOUR MIND

311
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:28,148
OFF THE FACT THAT YOU RIPPED
YOUR VAGINA TO YOUR ASS[bleep].

312
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,550
SO I'M GONNA COME BACK TOMORROW
AND VISIT JENNI.

313
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,019
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW SMALL THEY ARE?

314
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,854
- YOU'RE A GOOD KID,
I'LL TELL YA.

315
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:35,823
YOU'RE A GOOD KID.

316
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,826
- LORENZO'S LIKE A BEAST, NOW.

317
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,829
- LORENZO'S A LITTLE WISEASS.

318
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,630
- LORENZO HAS DEFINITELY
CHANGED.

319
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,866
OH, MY GOD,
HE'S NOT MY BABY ANYMORE,

320
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,035
AND THAT'S WHY I'M SO HAPPY
THAT I'M PREGNANT NOW,

321
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,437
BECAUSE NOW I
GET TO HAVE ANOTHER BABY,

322
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:53,440
AND HOPEFULLY IT'S GONNA BE
THE SAME EXACT BABY AS LORENZO,

323
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,108
JUST LIKE A REALLY,
REALLY GOOD KID,

324
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,309
BUT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA
HAPPEN.

325
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,045
IT'LL PROBABLY BE, LIKE,
A REALLY BAD BABY.

326
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:02,415
- THAT'S SO FUNNY THAT
LITERALLY LESS THAN TWO YEARS

327
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,985
AGO THAT WAS HIM.
NOW HE'S A LITTLE WISEASS.

328
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:07,120
- I KNOW.
- SAYING, "NO, NO, NO."

329
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,225
- DOES SHE GO THIS WAY,
BABE, OR THE OTHER WAY?

330
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,395
- IT'S FINE. YOU CAN PUSH HER UP
NEXT TO ME LIKE THAT.

331
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,265
- YOU ARE THE MOST
PERFECT LITTLE BABY.

332
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,268
- THAT'S YOUR SPERM.

333
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,036
- PRETTY MUCH.

334
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,905
I COULD LOOK AT YOU
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

335
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:29,342
AND I WILL BE LOOKING AT YOU
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

336
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:32,379
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,
I SHOULD SAY.

337
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,381
- CAN YOU KISS HER FOR ME?

338
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:37,184
- AND A KISS FROM MOMMY.

339
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,519
I'M GONNA DIM THOSE LIGHTS
FOR THAT LITTLE BABY TO SLEEP.

340
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:41,254
YOU KNOW,
AS THE LIGHTS GO OUT ON MY--

341
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:44,057
MY FIRST NIGHT AS A--AS A DAD,

342
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,459
I'M JUST THINKING, YOU KNOW,

343
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,595
WHY DID I THINK
THAT THIS WASN'T FOR ME?

344
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,463
YOU KNOW, WHY--
WHY DID I EVER THINK THAT?

345
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,531
THIS IS SO FOR ME.

346
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,601
I--I EMBRACE EVERY SECOND OF IT,

347
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,570
AND I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT TOMORROW BRINGS, YOU KNOW?

348
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,606
[chuckling]

349
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:03,010
YOU MAKE YOUR DADDY GIGGLE.

350
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,078
NOBODY MAKES YOUR DADDY GIGGLE.

351
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,947
- LOVE YOU.

352
00:14:07,047 --> 00:14:08,148
- I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART,

353
00:14:08,248 --> 00:14:10,350
BUT YOU JUST DEFINITELY
BECAME NUMBER-TWO BABY.

354
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,419
- GOOD NIGHT, BABE.

355
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,527
- IT SMELLS LIKE BURNT TOAST.

356
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:23,330
- THIS HAM SMELLS LIKE SACK
RIGHT NOW.

357
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,365
IT REALLY DOES, THAT'S
WHAT THAT SMELL IS, IS THIS HAM.

358
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:27,500
- WHY ARE YOU GONNA EAT IT
IF IT STINKS LIKE THAT?

359
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,503
- I'M HUNGRY.
IT REALLY SMELLS.

360
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,105
- LET ME SMELL.
- YOU FEEL BAD, NOW.

361
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,641
- LET ME SMELL.

362
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:35,842
OH!

363
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:39,279
ARE YOU CRAZY?
ARE YOU CRAZY?

364
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,314
- YEAH, I'M NUTS 'CAUSE
I JUST DID THAT.

365
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,649
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
SHUT UP.

366
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:46,186
- I'M TOUCHING MY EYELASH,
AND NOW I SMELL BALLS.

367
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,990
JIONNI, I THINK IT'S VERY RUDE
THAT YOU SLAPPED A COLD CUT

368
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,624
IN MY FACE
THAT SMELLED LIKE BUTTHOLE.

369
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,393
- YOU TRY TO SLAP ME
WITH GREASY STUFF ALL THE TIME.

370
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:54,427
- I SLAP YOU WITH SALAMI.

371
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,063
THAT DOESN'T SMELL BAD.

372
00:14:56,163 --> 00:15:00,233
- YOU TRY TO DO IT BECAUSE YOU
SAY YOU KNOW I GET PIMPLES.

373
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,735
PRETTY RUDE IF YOU ASK ME.
- I LIKE TO PISS HIM OFF.

374
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:06,173
I DO WANT TO DO SOMETHING
SPECIAL FOR JENNI.

375
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,041
I WANT TO,
LIKE, DECORATE THE HOUSE.

376
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,610
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING FOR JENNI AND ROGER

377
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,480
BECAUSE THEY DID SOMETHING FOR
US WHEN WE WERE IN THE HOSPITAL.

378
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,416
I WANT TO GO, LIKE,
WAY OVER TOP OF THAT AND JUST

379
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:17,550
MAKE THEM SMILE.

380
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,152
- ONE-UP THEM.
- YEAH.

381
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,653
- A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE GONNA COME VISIT.

382
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,055
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE NO FOOD
FOR THEM.

383
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,323
- YOU DON'T WANT
TO ORDER [bleep]

384
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,724
AND THEN THEY HAVE [bleep].
- THEY'RE NOT.

385
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,693
LET'S DO IT FOR THEM.

386
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:30,330
- SO WE CAN, LIKE, ORDER SUBS?

387
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,999
- WE'LL SET EVERYTHING UP.

388
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,234
- LOOK HOW BIG THAT HAWK IS.

389
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,568
- THERE'S TWO--
THERE'S THREE OF THEM.

390
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:37,604
HOLY PISS BALLS.

391
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:40,107
- THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
TO EAT. THEY FOUND SOMETHING.

392
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:43,710
THEY'RE WAITING FOR IT TO DIE.
- BLBLBLBLB!

393
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,712
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

394
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:46,713
WOULD YOU JUST LET THEM EAT ME?

395
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,681
- HOLY COW.
GO LAY ON YOUR BACK.

396
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,283
- NO.

397
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,385
- I'LL PUT KETCHUP ON YOU.
- NO.

398
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,822
- COME ON, JUST TRY IT.
- NO, JIONNI.

399
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,825
[upbeat music]

400
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:06,766
*

401
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:10,537
- DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP
AT ALL LAST NIGHT?

402
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:14,041
- I WAS UP EVERY HOUR
BETWEEN YOU SNORING TO THE POINT

403
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,208
WHERE I COULD HEAR YOU OUTSIDE,

404
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,776
AND THEN HER WAILING
'CAUSE OF YOUR SNORING,

405
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,079
I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO."

406
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,581
FIRST NIGHT WITH MEILANI,
I MEAN, I DIDN'T SLEEP.

407
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,083
YOU KNOW, I'M DELUSIONAL.

408
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,684
I'M A NEW MOM.
I'M RECOVERING.

409
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,653
I'M ON MEDICATION.

410
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,056
I HAVE A STITCH-UP VAGINA.

411
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,491
I JUST AM, LIKE, SO BEAT UP.

412
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,061
BUT LIKE, I WOULDN'T HAVE
THAT ANY OTHER WAY.

413
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:35,128
DO YOU WANT TO GET HER BAG
OVER HERE,

414
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:36,696
AND LET'S PUT HER IN AN OUTFIT?

415
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:40,233
- WE GOT TO CHECK
HER DIAPER, TOO.

416
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,535
THIS IS FRONT, CORRECT?
FRONT?

417
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,637
- OH, THAT'S THE BACK.

418
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:46,273
THE TABS ARE IN THE BACK.

419
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:47,474
- THEY ARE?
- MM-HMM.

420
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:48,541
- OH, YEAH, 'CAUSE
THEY COME AROUND, YEAH.

421
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,243
SINCE I'VE NEVER
CHANGED A DIAPER BEFORE,

422
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,245
JENNI KIND OF SHOWS ME
HOW TO DO IT,

423
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,714
AND I AM NOT SCARED AT ALL
OF A POOPY DIAPER.

424
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,083
IT DOES NOT SCARE ME.

425
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,417
JENNI BETTER NOT BE
SCARED OF THEM, EITHER,

426
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,419
'CAUSE I WILL BE IN THEM SOON.

427
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,354
GOD, I FEEL
LIKE I'M GONNA BREAK HER.

428
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,823
- NO, YOU WON'T.
- LIFT HER LIKE THIS?

429
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:06,359
I'M SORRY, HONEY.
OH, MY GOD, I CAN'T.

430
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,228
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA BREAK HER.
[baby fussing]

431
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:09,896
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

432
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,331
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

433
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:12,832
GET THE CLEAN ONE
UNDER THERE READY.

434
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,301
- MOMMY'S MANHANDLING YOU.

435
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:16,703
DADDY DOESN'T LIKE IT.

436
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,371
I DEFINITELY
THINK IT'S WEIRD 'CAUSE

437
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,340
I'M KIND OF THE BULL
THAT JUST RUNS THROUGH STUFF,

438
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,675
AND, YOU KNOW, WHATEVER GETS
SMASHED GETS SMASHED,

439
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,844
BUT I THINK I'M ALREADY
THE MORE GENTLE ONE

440
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,113
WITH MEILANI THAN JENNI IS.

441
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,214
SHE JUST KIND OF GRABS HER ARM

442
00:17:27,314 --> 00:17:28,281
AND PULLS IT
THROUGH A SLEEVE HOLE.

443
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,349
I'M JUST KIND OF, LIKE, TRYING

444
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,284
TO MANIPULATE IT
THROUGH REALLY EASY,

445
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,520
AND IT'S PROBABLY JUST 'CAUSE,
YOU KNOW, SHE'S MY LITTLE GIRL,

446
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,654
AND I JUST WANT TO PROTECT HER.

447
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,389
- YOU SAW HOW SHE CAME
OUT OF MY VAGINA.

448
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,891
SHE'S NOT GONNA BREAK EASY.

449
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,967
- MOVE, I--I CAN'T SEE.

450
00:17:48,135 --> 00:17:49,636
- I CAN'T MOVE THE FLOWERS.

451
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,938
- WHY ARE YOU YELLING?
- WHY ARE YOU YELLING?

452
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,407
- I SAID, "I CAN'T SEE,"
IN A TONED VOICE.

453
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,875
- I SAID IT IN A TONED VOICE.
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

454
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,177
- I WAS JUST A LITTLE LOUDER
SO YOU COULD HEAR ME

455
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,345
'CAUSE YOU'RE OLD.

456
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,580
ME AND JIONNI ARE GOING
TO SEE JENNI AND ROGER

457
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,515
AT THE HOSPITAL AGAIN,

458
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:03,783
AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE THE BABY.

459
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,785
HELLO?
- HEY.

460
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:08,788
- YAY, I BROUGHT FLOWERS.
- HI!

461
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:12,024
I'M CHOPPED LIVER
AT THIS POINT, RIGHT?

462
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,293
YOU JUST WANT TO SEE MY BABY?

463
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,361
- YEAH, I REALLY
DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.

464
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:15,595
- YEAH, I FIGURED.

465
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,164
- CAN I HOLD HER?
- SURE.

466
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,366
- YEAH.
- ROGER, DO YOU HAVE A CAR SEAT?

467
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:20,633
- I DO, YEAH.

468
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,734
I GOT TO GO PUT IT IN.

469
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:22,902
- YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT?
I'LL COME--

470
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,071
- YEAH, COME--COME WITH ME.

471
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,606
- LET'S GO SET THIS THING
UP, YEAH.

472
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,175
- MY GOOD LITTLE BUDDY HERE,

473
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,577
JIONNI, IS GONNA SUPERVISE
ME PUTTING THE CAR SEAT

474
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,745
IN TO MAKE SURE I DO IT RIGHT.
I'M A FIRST-TIME DAD.

475
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:35,047
HE'S DONE THIS A MILLION TIMES
AT THIS POINT.

476
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,584
- ALL RIGHT, IT'S TIME TO EAT.
- SEE?

477
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:40,287
- WHAT?
YOU'RE SUCH A [bleep].

478
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,788
- NO, THAT'S PRETTY GROSS.

479
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,456
MY STOMACH IS KIND
OF FLAT RIGHT NOW.

480
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,425
- YOU'RE SUCH A WHORE!

481
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,494
- IT'S ALL PUFFY.
- IT'S NOT NORMAL.

482
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:49,562
NOBODY BOUNCES BACK THE WAY

483
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,097
JENNI HAS.
- MY MOM DID.

484
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,299
- AND IT REALLY
PISSES ME THE HELL OFF.

485
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:54,201
WELL, CLEARLY, YOUR MOM AND YOU,

486
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,403
THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
I'VE EVER SEEN.

487
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,637
SKINNY BITCHES.

488
00:18:57,737 --> 00:19:00,207
- SHUT UP.
- THAT'S WHAT I DO.

489
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:01,274
- IT'S GONNA BE
THE LONGEST TRIP HOME.

490
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,409
IT TOOK US 20 MINUTES
TO GET HERE.

491
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,244
IT'S GONNA
TAKE US 45 TO GET HOME.

492
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:05,812
SO I THINK
WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE, HERE,

493
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:07,880
IS ONCE WE INSTALL THE CAR SEAT,

494
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,716
IS THAT YOU CLIMB UP IN THERE,

495
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:10,750
AND I'LL HELP YOU IN,

496
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,552
THEN I'LL STRAP YOU IN.

497
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,254
I'LL GIVE YOU A PACIFIER.

498
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,223
WE'LL TAKE A RIDE AROUND TOWN
JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT,

499
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,524
YOU KNOW,
I GOT THE HANG OF THIS.

500
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,526
- YOUR HANDS BETTER BE
AT TEN AND TWO.

501
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:22,362
- WHERE ARE YOUR HANDS
WHEN YOU DRIVE, SIX AND SIX?

502
00:19:25,031 --> 00:19:28,868
- PUT THAT THROUGH THE BOTTOM.
- ALL RIGHT.

503
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,937
READY?
I'M GONNA REEF ON IT.

504
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,539
I FEEL SAFE WITH HER IN THERE.

505
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,807
LET'S JUST PUT THE SEAT ON IT.

506
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,247
- AH, THAT'S GOOD.

507
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:42,382
EASY TO COME OFF.

508
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:45,485
- TAKE IT OFF
WITH TWO LITTLE HANDLES.

509
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:48,421
- AH, RIGHT HERE.
THIS--I GOT ONE ON THIS SIDE.

510
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,489
- YUP.
- ALL RIGHT.

511
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,123
SO IT'S RIGHT THERE.

512
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,526
- I FEEL SAFE WITH HER IN THERE.
IT DOESN'T MOVE BARELY AT ALL.

513
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:57,497
- ROGER WENT IN TO THE HOSPITAL
ONE OF THE SCARIEST GUYS I KNOW

514
00:19:57,597 --> 00:19:59,666
AND CAME OUT ONE
OF THE SOFTEST GUYS I KNOW.

515
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,635
HE'S JUST A TYPICAL DAD,
AND HE LOVES HIS DAUGHTER, AND,

516
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:04,771
YOU KNOW, IT'S FOR THE BEST.
- AND THE WEIRD THING ABOUT IT

517
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,806
IS I'M SO COMPLETELY
FINE WITH IT.

518
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:10,209
I DON'T CARE IF I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE STREET CRED.

519
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,445
ALL RIGHT?
- YUP, GOOD WORK.

520
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,414
- NICE.
NICE HUSTLE.

521
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:18,150
- I FEEL LIKE YOU HAD
A REALLY BAD DELIVERY STORY.

522
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,552
- I JUST HAD A FAIR ONE.

523
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:20,787
- YOU FELT IT.

524
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:21,888
THAT'S BAD ENOUGH.

525
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,357
- I KNOW.
I HAD A RAPID LABOR.

526
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,559
- IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOSE?
- NO.

527
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,195
- I FEEL LIKE MY DOCTOR
GAVE ME THAT EXTRA STITCH,

528
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,498
WHERE IT'S JUST...TIGHT.

529
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,400
- I HOPE MINE IS.
I DIDN'T ASK FOR ONE.

530
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,467
- DID YOU GET THE EXTRA STITCH?

531
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,702
- I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS IN TOO MUCH PAIN.

532
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:36,936
I JUST WANTED IT ALL TO BE DONE.

533
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,171
- WHAT IF HE DIDN'T DO IT,
AND...

534
00:20:39,272 --> 00:20:40,172
- GOOD,
MAYBE THE NEXT ONE WILL--

535
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:42,208
- THINGS JUST FALL OUT OF THERE?

536
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,110
- MAYBE MY NEXT ONE
WON'T BE SO PAINFUL.

537
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,712
- MM.

538
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,180
SO AFTER THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE,
YOU STILL WANT ANOTHER ONE?

539
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,549
- YEAH.
- THAT'S GOOD.

540
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:51,784
- OH, MY GOD, ROGER,
HE WAS--LAST NIGHT HE WAS LIKE,

541
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,786
HE SAID SOMETHING,
THE CUTEST THING EVER.

542
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,789
HE WAS LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW
WHY I EVER WANTED A SON."

543
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,459
- LIKE, HE'S SO HAPPY
WITH A DAUGHTER?

544
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,830
- OH, YEAH, HE WAS LIKE,
"I NEEDED A PRECIOUS ANGEL."

545
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,432
- GIVE HIM A BOY ANYWAY.

546
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:07,334
- OH, YEAH, I WAS LIKE,
"I NEED A BOY."

547
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,336
I DEFINITELY THINK
THAT IF I WAS TO TRY AGAIN,

548
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,203
I WOULD TRY ONE MORE TIME
NATURALLY

549
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,472
TO SEE IF WE COULD JUST, LIKE,

550
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,507
ROLL THE DICE
AND HAVE A BOY ON OUR OWN.

551
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,976
BUT IF WE HAVE TWO GIRLS,
I'M DEFINITELY GONNA GET,

552
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:20,380
LIKE, ARTIFICIALLY INSEMINATED
FOR A BOY THE THIRD TIME,

553
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,449
'CAUSE THERE IS NO WAY
I'M HAVING THREE GIRLS.

554
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:25,418
THREE OF ME IN THE HOUSE,
PLUS ME?

555
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,687
I'D BASH MY [bleep] HEAD
UP AGAINST THE WALL.

556
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,623
- MY ANESTHESIOLOGIST DIED.
- WHAT?

557
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:31,891
- YEAH, HE DIED.
- I MEAN, THEY'RE ALL--

558
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,594
- THAT WAS A GOOD ONE,
LIKE, 'CAUSE HE--

559
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:36,696
YOU KNOW, HE HIT THE RIGHT SPOT,
EVERYTHING. I FELT NUMB.

560
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:41,601
WHAT IF THE NEW ONE,
I GO NUMB UP?

561
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:45,171
I'M LIKE--
- OH, MY GOD.

562
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:46,806
- IT'D BE AWFUL.
STICK IT TO ME.

563
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,908
I DON'T CARE.
I'D RATHER SLOW IT DOWN

564
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:53,279
AND NOT FEEL IT
THAN JUST FEEL EVERYTHING.

565
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,781
THIS IS OUR LIVES, NOW.
- MM-HMM.

566
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,182
- WE'RE MOMS.

567
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:58,250
BUT COOL MOMS.
- SEXY MOMS.

568
00:21:58,385 --> 00:21:59,486
- SEXY MOMS.

569
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:01,388
THAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE.
- YEAH?

570
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,490
- THEY GET NUMB
UP AND THEN THEY'RE LIKE--

571
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,392
THEY FEEL EVERYTHING.

572
00:22:16,035 --> 00:22:18,505
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO TODAY,
LORENZO?

573
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:21,207
WE HAVE A WHOLE DAY
TO DO ANYTHING.

574
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:26,312
I WAS THINKING
WE CAN GO TO THE ZOO!

575
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,515
- ZOO.

576
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:30,182
both: YOU WANT TO GO TO THE ZOO?
- YEAH.

577
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,685
- YEAH? JENNI AND MEILANI
ARE STILL RECOVERING

578
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:35,321
AT THE HOSPITAL, SO WHILE WE
WAIT FOR THEM TO COME HOME,

579
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:37,023
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A FAMILY DAY AT THE ZOO.

580
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:38,758
- WHAT'S AT THE ZOO?

581
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:42,328
- LIONS.
- LION.

582
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:46,265
- TIGERS AND BEARS.
- TIGER. BEAR.

583
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:47,767
- WHAT'S A LION DO?
- ROAR.

584
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:48,801
- ROAR.

585
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,437
- LORENZO LOVES THE ZOO,

586
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,138
AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO TAKE HIM TO THE POPCORN ZOO.

587
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:54,140
WE TOOK HIM LAST YEAR,
BUT THE FACT THAT,

588
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,575
YOU KNOW, HE'S A LITTLE OLDER,

589
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,276
HE KNOWS A LITTLE MORE ANIMALS,
IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME.

590
00:22:57,444 --> 00:22:58,511
- WILL YOU GO THROW THIS OUT
FOR MAMA?

591
00:22:58,611 --> 00:22:59,712
- NO.

592
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:00,713
- WILL YOU THROW IT
IN THE GARBAGE?

593
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:01,814
- NO.

594
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:02,815
- PLEASE?
- NO.

595
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,451
- PLEASE?
- NO!

596
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:05,952
- DO YOU KNOW HOW TO SAY YES?
- NO.

597
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,219
- SAY YES.
- NO.

598
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,555
- SAY YES!
- NO.

599
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:10,823
- SAY YES.
- NO.

600
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:15,194
- LORENZO, SAY YES.
- NO.

601
00:23:15,294 --> 00:23:17,597
- SO ANNOYING.

602
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,232
- THIS IS PACKED.
- IT'S THE POPCORN ZOO.

603
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,734
EVERYONE LOVES THE POPCORN ZOO.

604
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:24,270
- WHERE DO I PARK?
- LORENZO,

605
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,606
YOU WANT SOME POPCORN?
- YEAH.

606
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:27,607
- YEAH?
- NO.

607
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:28,675
- IT'S WHAT--
- [mumbles]

608
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,677
- HUH?
CAN YOU SAY POPCORN?

609
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,579
- A PEACOCK.

610
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:33,846
- PIGGY.

611
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,882
LORENZO, MONKEYS!

612
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:39,285
DO--DOES THIS ONE THROW POOPY
AT YOU?

613
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:41,488
- HE'S SCRATCHING HIS BUTT.
- HE'S SCRATCHING HIS BUTT.

614
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,490
- WHOA, IT'S A PANDA.

615
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,257
- WHAT IS THAT?
IS THAT A SEAL?

616
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:46,859
IS THAT A BEAR?
DUDE, WHAT IS THAT?

617
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,861
- WHOA, LOOK AT ITS TAIL.

618
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,763
- MAYBE IT'S AN ANTEATER.

619
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:53,199
- AN ANTEATER?

620
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:54,867
- WHAT IS THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

621
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,336
- OH, GOD,
THEY'RE VELOCIRAPTORS.

622
00:23:57,504 --> 00:23:59,171
- IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GONNA
PECK MY HEAD OFF IN TWO SECONDS.

623
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,941
- HERE, LOOK.
- WHOA.

624
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,877
- WHOO!
EAT!

625
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:08,147
DO IT AGAIN.
[laughter]

626
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:15,655
[Lorenzo laughing]

627
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,524
[all laughing]

628
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,926
- LORENZO IS CRACKING UP.
- IT'S SO CUTE.

629
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:24,163
- LIKE, LITERALLY, LIKE, HE'S
JUST CRACKING UP THE WHOLE TIME.

630
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,866
- LORENZO!
- DOES HE GET IT?

631
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,235
THIS WAS ONE OF THE REAL REASONS

632
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:31,771
WHY I WANTED TO BRING LORENZO
TO THE ZOO, STUFF LIKE THIS.

633
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:33,806
- HE MAKES US SMILE.

634
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,274
- WHOA, LOOK AT THAT THING.

635
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,776
- WOW.

636
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:38,845
- DON'T THINK HE WANTS POPCORN.
- DOES IT WANT TO EAT LORENZO?

637
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,379
- PROBABLY.
- HI!

638
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:41,614
- HEY, NICOLE.
- WHO'S THAT?

639
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:42,782
OH.

640
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:44,584
HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW ARE YOU?

641
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:46,919
- THE OWNER
OF POPCORN ZOO COMES UP TO US,

642
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:49,956
AND OF COURSE, HE REMEMBERS ME
FROM THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE.

643
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,958
- THIS IS ALL FAMILIAR TO YOU
WHEN YOU USED TO COME

644
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:54,426
AND CLEAN THESE CAGES?

645
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:57,263
- YEAH.
- YOU SHOVELED POOP?

646
00:24:57,363 --> 00:25:00,633
- LORENZO, MOMMY ONE TIME
GOT IN TROUBLE WITH THE POLICE,

647
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,002
AND SHE HAD TO COME HERE
AND DO COMMUNITY SERVICE.

648
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,571
I HAD TO DO COMMUNITY SERVICE

649
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:05,938
BECAUSE I GOT DRUNK
ON THE BEACH,

650
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:08,575
AND I GOT ARRESTED.

651
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:12,444
OH, MY VAGINA'S OUT.
AAH!

652
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:13,780
- NICOLE!

653
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,848
- I JUST WANT TO GO
ON THE BEACH.

654
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,585
WHERE'S THE BEACH?

655
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,353
[carnival music wind down]

656
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,690
I'M A [bleep] GOOD PERSON.

657
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,991
IT HAPPENS.

658
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,425
BUT I DID MY DUTIES.

659
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:28,394
I DID MY CRIME.

660
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,296
I SERVED MY CRIME.
- DID YOUR TIME?

661
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:31,397
- I DID MY TIME.

662
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:32,599
- THAT'S
WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.

663
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:34,601
- I DID MY TIME.

664
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,936
- SHE DID A GOOD JOB.

665
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,238
[Lorenzo laughing]

666
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,014
- I HAVE THE BABY'S BIRTH
CERTIFICATE.

667
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:51,050
- OH, GREAT.
[murmuring]

668
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,418
- WE'RE GONNA GO OVER IT.

669
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:53,853
I NEED YOU GUYS
TO GO LINE BY LINE,

670

00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:29,181
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

840
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:30,749
I WOULD LOVE TO STAY
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

841
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,919
I WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE
TO MOVE IN BECAUSE I FEEL SAFE.

842
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,921
I'M A NERVOUS NELLIE TO GO HOME.

843
00:32:36,022 --> 00:32:37,356
WHO THE HELL SAYS THAT?

844
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,725
LIKE, I'M NERVOUS TO GO HOME
WITH A NEWBORN 'CAUSE

845
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,060
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT.

846
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,029
THIS IS HARD TO--HARD--SEE?

847
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:45,697
I'M, LIKE,
STUTTERING STANLEY OVER HERE.

848
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,266
IT'S HARD NOT TO GET NERVOUS.

849
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:49,768
WHEN DO YOU WANT
TO GET HER EARS PIERCED?

850
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:51,703
- SHE'S SO PRETTY, SHE
DOESN'T NEED HER EARS PIERCED.

851
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,871
WE WERE WORRIED
THAT SHE WAS GONNA BE UGLY

852
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,806
AND WE WERE GONNA
HAVE TO ACCESSORIZE HER.

853
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:56,708
SHE DOESN'T NEED EARRINGS.

854
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,123
- I HAVE TO GET A FEW THINGS
AT THIS PARTY STORE,

855
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:12,858
MAINLY BALLOONS,

856
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:15,061
SO WHEN SHE COMES HOME,
IT'S LITERALLY,

857
00:33:15,127 --> 00:33:19,365
LIKE, HOLY [bleep], WHERE DID
ALL THESE BALLOONS COME FROM?

858
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,835
- DO YOU HAVE A BIG ENOUGH CAR?

859
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,237
- UM.
- THAT'S A LOT OF BALLOONS.

860
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,638
- YEAH, WE'LL SEE.
- OKAY.

861
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,540
- WE'LL SEE HOW THAT WORKS OUT.

862
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,143
I JUST HOPE ALL OF THE BALLOONS
FIT INTO THE CAR.

863
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:34,180
GET IN THERE, BABIES.

864
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,116
THERE WE GO.

865
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:39,818
COME ON, WHORES.

866
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:40,952
ANNOYING.

867
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,588
OOH!

868
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:44,723
GOTCHA.

869
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:47,859
GET IN THERE. SQUEEZE IN THERE.

870
00:33:56,902 --> 00:33:59,838
SUCCESS!

871
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:04,143
I'M A LITTLE HAPPY I
DIDN'T ORDER A MILLION BALLOONS.

872
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:05,344
BUT, I MEAN, SERIOUSLY,

873
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:09,381
A MILLION BALLOONS
WOULD'VE BEEN AWESOME.

874
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,117
SUCCESS.

875
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,319
I CAN'T SEE [bleep]
OUT OF MY MIRRORS.

876
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:20,359
- LET'S PUT YOU IN HERE.
IF YOU'RE NOT COMFY,

877
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:23,262
DADDY'LL TAKE YOU
RIGHT BACK OUT.

878
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:26,132
- OOPS, SHE LOST HER SOCKIE
ALREADY.

879
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:27,133
- ALL RIGHTY.
- THAT'S OKAY.

880
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:30,236
- GOT TO PUT THAT SOCKIE ON.
HANG ON.

881
00:34:30,336 --> 00:34:33,772
- DO YOU HOW TO SHUT
THE--WHAT THE [bleep]?

882
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:36,775
THERE WE GO.
- YOU READY TO GO HOME?

883
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:39,044
BRINGING MEILANI HOME
FOR THE FIRST TIME IS--IT'S--

884
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:41,012
YOU CAN'T DESCRIBE THE FEELING.

885
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:43,749
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST THAT FEELING
OF ACCOMPLISHMENT,

886
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:45,551
THAT YOU'RE NOW OFFICIALLY
PARENTS.

887
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,520
YOU'VE WELCOMED A BEAUTIFUL GIRL
INTO THE WORLD,

888
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,022
AND ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE'VE
DONE OVER THE LAST TEN MONTHS

889
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:52,358
TO PREPARE

890
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,260
MEILANI'S ROOM AND ALL THAT,
NOW SHE GETS TO SEE IT.

891
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,162
SHE GETS TO EXPERIENCE IT
AND GET TO--

892
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:58,830
TO BE PART
OF THIS HOUSEHOLD, OUR FAMILY.

893
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,166
MEILANI'S FIRST RIDE.

894
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:05,504
WE'RE GOING HOME.

895
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,674
OH, GOD, THAT'S CRAZY.

896
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,041
- SHE IS PASSED OUT.

897
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:13,179
TAKING MY DAUGHTER HOME
RIGHT NOW IS 20 BILLION TIMES

898
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:15,681
MORE NERVE-RACKING
THAN GOING TO THE HOSPITAL.

899
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,684
- WE'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR THIS FOR TEN MONTHS.

900
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,419
HOLD ON, BABY,
THERE'S A LITTLE BUMP.

901
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:21,720
OOP.

902
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,921
YOU KNOW, I WASN'T WORRIED

903
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,956
AT ALL
ABOUT DRIVING HOME WITH MEILANI

904
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,658
IN THE CAR UNTIL I GOT
BEHIND THE DRIVER'S SEAT,

905
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:28,026
AND THAT ALL CHANGED.

906
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:30,028
YOU KNOW, I'M NORMALLY
A LITTLE BIT OF A LEAD FOOT.

907
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:32,097
- ROGER IS AN INSANE DRIVER,

908
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:34,866
BUT I'M SURPRISED
WE'RE ACTUALLY MOVING.

909
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,203
- JUST, YOU KNOW,
BEING A CONCERNED DAD.

910
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:41,106
WE MADE IT UP TO 40.

911
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:44,976
- I LOVE OUR FIRST RIDE HOME
AS A FAMILY.

912
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:46,545
YOU ONLY GET ONE FIRST.

913
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,914
ONE FIRST RIDE,
ONE FIRST NIGHT WITH HER,

914
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,015
ONE FIRST LOOK AT HER,

915
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,016
IT'S, YOU KNOW,

916
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:54,220
I'M LOVING ALL THE FIRSTS.

917
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:55,821
- TAKING YOU HOME, MEILANI.

918
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,123
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MEET THE CRAZY DOGGIES TODAY,

919
00:35:58,224 --> 00:35:59,525
BUT YOU'RE GONNA MEET THEM SOON.

920
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:01,126
IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEM,
YOU JUST TELL DADDY,

921
00:36:01,227 --> 00:36:03,929
'CAUSE I'LL DRIVE THEM RIGHT
TO THE POUND FOR YOU.

922
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,665
- I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE
SHE CAME OUT OF MY VAGINA.

923
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:07,933
- OH, SHE DID.

924
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,134
I SAW HER.

925
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:13,339
YOU UNHINGED SIMILAR
TO A COBRA'S JAWS.

926
00:36:13,439 --> 00:36:15,006
- STOP.
- YOU DID.

927
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:17,809
- I'M STITCHED UP.
SO THIS IS

928
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:21,647
WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING THE MOM
IN THE BACKSEAT.

929
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:25,317
- OH, THERE'LL BE
PLENTY MORE ROAD TRIPS WITH DAD.

930
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:28,287
- [bleep] THAT [bleep].

931
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:29,988
MEILANI, JUST LOOK AT--

932
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:31,790
YOU KNOW THAT I
AM OFFICIALLY CHOPPED LIVER?

933
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,659
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME, AGAIN,
AND WHY ARE YOU IN THE CAR?

934
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:35,561
- SPAM.
I'M WORSE THAN CHOPPED LIVER.

935
00:36:35,661 --> 00:36:36,995
I AM SPAM.

936
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:40,332
I AM CANNED MEAT.

937
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:43,369
- EXCUSE ME.
DON'T MOVE.

938
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,971
[screams]

939
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,573
[honking]

940
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:51,577
- HOLY MARY, MOTHER OF GOD.

941
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:54,946
- BE CAREFUL.
IT'S A LITTLE WINDY.

942
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,815
[balloon pops]

943
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,984
WHAT WAS THAT?

944
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:00,286
DID YOU POP A BALLOON?

945
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:02,020
JIONNI!

946
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,355
- NICOLE GOT ENOUGH BALLOONS.

947
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:04,756
I MEAN,
SHE DEFINITELY OVERDID IT.

948
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,157
I KNEW SHE WAS GONNA OVERDO IT,

949
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:10,329
AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE
GONNA HANG THESE THINGS.

950
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:13,932
I'M GONNA TIE THEM ALONG--ALONG
THE DECK AND STUFF, ALL RIGHT?

951
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:16,067
- WHO CARES WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE?
FOOD'S HERE.

952
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:18,003
- THANK GOD.

953
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,771
- I JUST HOPE EVERYTHING
WORKS OUT GOOD.

954
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:21,307
OW.

955
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:23,309
- WOULD YOU PLEASE RELAX?
- I'M TRYING.

956
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:25,344
HOW CAN I RELAX WHEN I
HAVE TO DO ALL THIS [bleep]?

957
00:37:25,444 --> 00:37:27,078
YOU KNOW, IT'S ALL ABOUT TIMING.

958
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:29,080
DO WE HAVE TIME FOR YOU TO RUB
MY FEET REAL QUICK?

959
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,349
- NO.

960
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:33,719
- I, LIKE, WANT HER TO SEE IT
WHEN SHE WALKS IN.

961
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:36,221
IT'S CUTE.

962
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:37,222
DON'T FALL.

963
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:38,324
- GOT IT.

964
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,326
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

965
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,860
- TELL ME IF IT'S CENTERED.
- PUT IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

966
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,629
WHY IS IT SO HOT OUT?

967
00:37:43,729 --> 00:37:45,130
- 'CAUSE IT'S THE SUMMER.

968
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,699
- OH, CUTE.

969
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,001
GREAT, THEY'RE TANGLED.
- WE DID IT.

970
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,370
- NO, WE'RE MISSING
THE MARIACHI BAND.

971
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,772
WE DIDN'T DO IT YET.

972
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:57,142
WHAT IF THEY COME AND THEN
THE MARIACHI BAND'S NOT HERE?

973
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,580
- THIS EPISODE OF
SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW...

974
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,383
- CONTINUES NOW.

975
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,361
- ALL RIGHT, WHERE'S THIS BAND?

976
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:18,830
ALL WE NEED IS THE BAND,
AND WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

977
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:20,366
[knocking at door]

978
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:21,567
THAT'S GOT TO BE
THE MARIACHI BAND.

979
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:23,134
WHY IS HE KNOCKING SO HARD?

980
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,370
- OH, MY GOD.

981
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,104
[playing mariachi music]

982
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:28,039
- I'M LITERALLY JUST SO HAPPY

983
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,809
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING
IS FALLING INTO PLACE.

984
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,911
WE HAVE EVERYTHING DONE,
AND BASICALLY WE JUST

985
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,646
HAVE TO WAIT
FOR JENNI AND ROGER TO GET HERE.

986
00:38:34,746 --> 00:38:38,517
- YAY!

987
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:40,786
- WE'RE ALMOST HERE, BABY.

988
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:43,722
- IS THAT THEM?

989
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,524
DID THEY PULL UP?
- OH, [bleep], THEY'RE HERE.

990
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:49,828
WE SAY WHAT, WELCOME HOME?

991
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:50,829
YOU'RE GONNA
BE THE FIRST PERSON.

992
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,130
- WELCOME HOME.

993
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,865
- YOU GO.
- IT'S HOT OUT HERE.

994
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,734
WE GOT TO GET HER INSIDE.

995
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:59,671
- WELCOME HOME, MATTHEWS FAMILY.
NO.

996
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,072
- WELCOME HOME, MEILANI.
- JUST WELCOME HOME.

997
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,174
- RIGHT, THAT'LL DO.
- WELCOME HOME, WELCOME MEILANI.

998
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:04,410
- WELCOME HOME, MEILANI.

999
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:06,244
- AFTER MOMMY.

1000
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:07,278
- WAIT TILL--WAIT
TILL THEY GET UP.

1001
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:09,415
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

1002
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:12,618
both: WELCOME HOME, MEILANI.
- HEY.

1003
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:15,086
- HI, BABY.
- HOW ARE YOU?

1004
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,321
WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

1005
00:39:16,422 --> 00:39:17,489
- HERE, LET ME TAKE HER
OFF YOUR HANDS

1006
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,057
- YOU GOT HER? YOU SURE?
- COME ON, I GOT HER.

1007
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,191
- I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.
