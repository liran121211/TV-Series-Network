No.

128

You have to put them
at opposite sides.

129

"If you fight at my wedding,
I'’ll kill both of you."

00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:55,803
I'’m chopped liver
at this point.

179
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:57,322
You are not
chopped liver.

180
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:59,945
- It'’s all about her.
- Well, Jen, when you'’re ready.

181
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:01,430
I think my vagina'’s okay.

182
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,121
Oh, I hope so.

183
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,606
So, I was actually
wondering if you guys

184
00:06:05,675 --> 00:06:07,608
still own that
labor simulator?

185
00:06:07,677 --> 00:06:08,713
Ooh, yeah.

186
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:09,921
- You do?
- Oh, yeah.

187
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,647
I would like Roger
to feel the contractions.

188
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:12,924
- Oh, I love it.
- Yeah.

189
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:15,271
So I know Doctor Rezai
has this machine

190
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,412
at his office that is basically
a labor simulator,

191
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:20,518
and I'’m dying to get
Roger to try it

192
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:24,349
because even though he is
a sympathetic father and fiancé,

193
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,317
he was very, you know,
kind and gentle during my labor,

194
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,492
I still want him
to [bleep] feel it.

195
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:31,080
We have a little
surprise for you.

196
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,115
For me?

197
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,427
- Yeah, just for you.
- Okay.

198
00:06:33,496 --> 00:06:35,636
[Jenni]
It'’s a new vagina
you'’re getting.

199
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,293
Do you have one of those
fake ones that you show?

200
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:38,950
- '’Cause I'’ll take that home.
- I do have one. I'’ll show you.

201
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:41,055
Works better
than the one I got.

202
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:42,712
I kind of want
to see Roger in pain.

203
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:44,438
Is that mean?
I don'’t think it'’s mean.

204
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:46,198
I want to see him in pain.
I want to see him wince.

205
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,580
- Since Jenni had such a...
- Wonderful.

206
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:50,410
Wonderful, quick labor,

207
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,998
we wanted to see if you
wanted to experience that.

208
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:54,552
- Labor?
- Yeah.

209
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:57,140
How do you simulate labor?

210
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,384
Ow!

211
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,697
The pain is only temporary.
Remember, you told me that.

212
00:07:01,766 --> 00:07:05,183
Listen, you had--
you had--oh!

213
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:06,218
Keep going.

214
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:08,186
Marge is at the controls
over there

215
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:09,808
and cranking
the higher button.

216
00:07:09,877 --> 00:07:11,361
I'’m gonna grin and bear it,

217
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,433
but all I can hear is Jenni,

218
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15,573
like, hyena-laughing
over there in the corner.

219
00:07:15,642 --> 00:07:16,574
[laughs]

220
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:17,678
[Marge]
Okay.

221
00:07:17,747 --> 00:07:18,679
We'’re going all
the way to the top.

222
00:07:18,748 --> 00:07:21,130
Oh, ow!

223
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,303
And I feel like Meilani
was even getting

224
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:24,754
a little bit
of a kick out of this.

225
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:26,135
Is my stomach moving around?

226
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:27,723
[Marge]
Yeah, it is.

227
00:07:27,792 --> 00:07:29,172
Oh!

228
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,589
Oh, that'’s going
down my leg now.

229
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:32,590
It'’s going down my groin.

230
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,177
You want the epidural now?

231
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:36,076
You'’re gonna
blow a circuit breaker.

232
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:37,249
[laughter]

233
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:39,355
- I don'’t want to [bleep] you.
- Oh!

234
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,360
Listen, Marge,
you can take one for the team.

235
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,327
That'’s the most action
he'’ll get in a long time.

236
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:48,019
Oh!

237
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:51,022
Oh, right here,
holy [bleep].

238
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:52,023
Oh!

239
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,994
- [bleep]-A, man.
- You okay?

240
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:07,935
What should we
ask these guys?

241
00:08:08,004 --> 00:08:10,075
[Jenni]
I think everything
from A to Z.

242
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:12,181
- Sex.
- Have you ever cheated?

243
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,459
[Jenni]
I don'’t think
they'’ll be honest, but...

244
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,496
My diaper'’s falling out.

245
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:19,326
[Nicole voice-over]
Today is the day that we'’re
doing Joey'’s speed dating,

246
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:21,673
just because he doesn'’t have
a date for my wedding,

247
00:08:21,742 --> 00:08:24,020
and I basically found seven,
eight guys.

248
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:27,023
And we'’re just gonna
pick our favorite guy.

249
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:29,025
Well, Joey'’s eventually
gonna pick, but, you know.

250
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:31,649
We'’re gonna pick, too,
who our favorite guy is for Joey

251
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:32,650
to bring to my wedding.

252
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,617
[whistles blow]

253
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:35,618
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, guys.

254
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:36,930
[all]
Hey.

255
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,587
[Jenni]
Thank you all for coming.

256
00:08:38,656 --> 00:08:39,898
We really appreciate it.

257
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,313
[Nicole]
We'’re really
excited about this.

258
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:42,314
Yes.

259
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:43,350
Honestly, the first
thing I noticed

260
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,834
is that none
of them are bears.

261
00:08:44,903 --> 00:08:46,180
[Nicole voice-over]
I don'’t see any bears.

262
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:48,251
I feel like all the bears
are hibernating right now.

263
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,290
- Joey'’s here!
- Joey'’s here!

264
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:54,016
- Hi!
- Yay!

265
00:08:54,085 --> 00:08:57,295
[Jenni]
Our two other Joeys are here
for support and to make sure...

266
00:08:57,364 --> 00:08:58,296
[Nicole]
They'’re taken.

267
00:08:58,365 --> 00:08:59,469
That Joey doesn'’t get so drunk

268
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,678
that he doesn'’t know
what he'’s doing

269
00:09:00,747 --> 00:09:02,058
and makes bad decisions.

270
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,059
Like normal.

271
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:04,095
- Yes.
- Yes.

272
00:09:04,164 --> 00:09:05,372
I hope--do we have roses
to give to them?

273
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:07,374
Give them your penis.

274
00:09:07,443 --> 00:09:08,893
I'’ll just give you a penis.

275
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,552
- What is your name?
- Jimmy.

276
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:13,760
[Jenni]
Jimbo.

277
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:15,209
Oh, everyone'’s gonna
get a new name today, so.

278
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,004
- Hi.
- Hi. Richard?

279
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:18,109
- I'’m gonna call you Dickie.
- All right.

280
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:19,213
Dickie-doo.

281
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:20,318
- Dickie-doo?
- He was born in Vegas.

282
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:21,975
- He was born in Vegas.
- Oh.

283
00:09:22,044 --> 00:09:24,080
[Joey]
I'’m gonna call him Lil Dice.

284
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:25,461
[Nicole]
Lil Dice.

285
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,428
- You'’re so cute, Jordan.
- Oh, well, thank you.

286
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:29,327
Your name is Miss Cheesecake.

287
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:31,122
[laughter]

288
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:33,158
Je suis espagnol,
mais je parle francais.

289
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:34,470
Your new name, since
you'’re speaking French,

290
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:35,885
is Banji Bonjour.

291
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:37,646
- Banji Bonjour?
- Je l'’aime beaucoup.

292
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:39,337
- From the South.
- Oh, you are? From where?

293
00:09:39,406 --> 00:09:40,856
Georgia.

294
00:09:40,925 --> 00:09:42,927
Ooh, I'’m gonna
call him...

295
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,618
Peach Cakes.

296
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,655
- Peach Cakes.
- Georgia peach.

297
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:48,588
Can you turn around
so we can see your cakes?

298
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:53,489
Oh, my God.

299
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:55,940
Joey'’s just basically
checking out all the booties

300
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,943
to see what it would
look like if he was--

301
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,669
[bleep] that booty.

302
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:02,671
[laughing]

303
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,673
Disgusting.

304
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:06,744
What is your take
on open relationships?

305
00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:07,745
I'’ve been in a few.

306
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:09,850
How'’d that work out for you?

307
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,507
- Not great.
- No, not at all.

308
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:12,957
You think it'’s
gonna be amazing,

309
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:14,821
but then it doesn'’t
really work out.

310
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,029
When was your last boyfriend?

311
00:10:16,098 --> 00:10:18,997
- So I'’ve never had a boyfriend.
- Why?

312
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:20,999
It'’s not because I'’m a slut,
I swear.

313
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:22,242
Oh, that'’s good.

314
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:23,761
When was your last
relationship, if any?

315
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,486
It was actually a "thruple."

316
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:26,660
See, that'’s not good.

317
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:28,386
I could not deal
with two Rogers.

318
00:10:28,455 --> 00:10:29,559
I can'’t even deal
with one Roger.

319
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,044
[laughs]

320
00:10:31,113 --> 00:10:32,079
Thank you.

321
00:10:32,148 --> 00:10:34,288
I'’ve never had
a threesome.

322
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:35,324
Have you?

323
00:10:35,393 --> 00:10:37,326
Yes, you have. Ew!

324
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:39,259
- Once.
- Poor Meilani.

325
00:10:39,328 --> 00:10:41,433
- She'’s gonna be worse than you.
- No. She'’s gonna have a--

326
00:10:41,502 --> 00:10:42,642
What would you do
if she did that?

327
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:44,264
I would kill her.

328
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,059
She'’s not gonna be allowed
out of the house till she'’s 40.

329
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:48,130
What if--
what if Giovanna did it?

330
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:51,133
I'’d say, "No, no, no!"

331
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:52,410
[Jenni]
So what do you think?

332
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:53,376
Which one do you think
is gonna be good for him?

333
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,619
Oh, my God.

334
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:57,829
Well, I know what one
would be good for me.

335
00:10:57,898 --> 00:10:59,693
- Which one?
- I'’m just saying.

336
00:10:59,762 --> 00:11:01,177
- The dancer.
- I know.

337
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:02,903
But he'’s a [indistinct].

338
00:11:02,972 --> 00:11:04,353
Is he?

339
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:07,011
Of course he is.

340
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,529
[Joey]
So I'’m gonna be, like...

341
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:11,671
[humming]

342
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,880
[laughter]

343
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:15,605
Should I scream the name
and then grab him?

344
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,848
[Jenni]
No, just take their
hand and leave!

345
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:17,987
Grab him and go!

346
00:11:18,056 --> 00:11:20,852
- Peach Cakes!
- [all] Yay!

347
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,925
[Nicole]
Whoa!

348
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:28,342
[Jenni voice-over]
I think Joey'’s
picking his date

349
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:31,621
on who was most
attractive for tonight.

350
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,900
Guarantee we ain'’t gonna
see Peaches tomorrow.

351
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:39,284
[Nicole]
Even if Joey doesn'’t
bring Peaches to my wedding,

352
00:11:39,353 --> 00:11:41,493
he'’s gorgeous, he'’s fun,

353
00:11:41,562 --> 00:11:42,840
and...

354
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:45,325
I feel like he
has a big [bleep].

355
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:46,706
Don'’t you?

356
00:11:46,775 --> 00:11:47,810
Sorry, guys.

357
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,192
Sorry, guys.

358
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:07,416
Whoo, daddy'’s got you.

359
00:12:07,485 --> 00:12:09,798
She looks like
a little princess bride.

360
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,489
Today'’s the big day, honey.

361
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:13,940
It'’s all about her.

362
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:15,942
So today is our
daughter'’s christening,

363
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:17,460
and we'’re extremely excited.

364
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,739
It'’s very important
to us as parents.

365
00:12:19,808 --> 00:12:21,292
Let'’s find Auntie Nicole.

366
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:22,949
We'’re in very
capable hands here,

367
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:25,261
and I can'’t wait to have
my daughter baptized.

368
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,539
I wonder if they ever
dropped a baby.

369
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:30,508
It'’s a big day.

370
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:33,166
Wasn'’t that long ago we were
doing this for this little guy.

371
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:35,237
Yeah, now he'’s a booger.

372
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:36,686
[Nicole voice-over]
I'’m really excited for today

373
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,482
just because I am
Meilani'’s godmother,

374
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,415
and, you know, Jenni
went through this process

375
00:12:41,484 --> 00:12:44,211
already with Lorenzo
and baptizing him,

376
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,731
so now it'’s my turn
with Meilani,

377
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,872
and I-I'’m just wondering
if you'’re gonna cry.

378
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:51,840
Do you have your
godmother prayer?

379
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:53,324
- A godmother prayer?
- Yeah.

380
00:12:53,393 --> 00:12:54,428
Like, something--

381
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:55,567
I know I didn'’t
do it for Lorenzo,

382
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:57,466
but in this church,
like, a nice--

383
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,677
This isn'’t what
I had you do,

384
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:04,300
so I don'’t understand
why I have to do this.

385
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:05,992
How long is this prayer?

386
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:07,579
Just a couple--
just a little bit.

387
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:08,788
- A little bit?
- Just say something nice.

388
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:09,996
I don'’t like reading
in front of people.

389
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,721
I, like, stutter,
and I forget how to read.

390
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,964
- Well...
- Like, "Ah-bluh-luh-luh!"

391
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:14,863
Mom, comfort her.

392
00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,899
Nicole'’s duties
as a godmother, I mean,

393
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:19,868
I don'’t see them
being duties.

394
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:21,870
I just want you
in our life forever.

395
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:23,078
Let'’s see if you burn.

396
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:24,113
[Jenni voice-over]
And God forbid,

397
00:13:24,182 --> 00:13:25,390
if anything
was to happen

398
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:26,426
to Roger and I,

399
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:27,427
you would just
raise her the best--

400
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:28,842
- Take care of her.
- Yeah.

401
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:30,223
[Nicole]
I'’ll teach her
how to, like,

402
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:33,571
dance and drink.

403
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,125
Those are not your duties.

404
00:13:36,194 --> 00:13:40,060
[woman]
We welcome everyone
to the baptism of Meilani.

405
00:13:40,129 --> 00:13:42,960
At this time, we'’d like
to ask the godmother, Nicole,

406
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:44,754
to come up
for the godmother prayer.

407
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,723
Wait, what?
By myself?

408
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:50,346
- Remember, project your voice.
- Stop.

409
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:52,901
[Jenni voice-over]
This is a huge moment
in each other'’s lives.

410
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,282
We'’re each other'’s
kids'’ Godparents.

411
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:57,975
Everyone'’s looking at me.

412
00:13:58,044 --> 00:13:59,355
Can we--

413
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:02,220
look--
look at these guys.

414
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:03,394
All right.

415
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:04,982
[laughing]

416
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:09,503
Stop. All right.

417
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:12,437
I can'’t read in front of people.

418
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:14,577
She didn'’t know
she had to do this.

419
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,785
Just tell me.
Just tell me.

420
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,959
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

421
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:18,512
[Nicole]
Oh, Lord Jesus Christ,

422
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:21,032
you embrace children
with the arms of your mercy

423
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:23,379
and make them living members
of your church.

424
00:14:23,448 --> 00:14:25,140
[Jenni voice-over]
I mean, it was always Nicole

425
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:28,419
that was gonna be my firstborn'’s
godmother, never a question.

426
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:30,076
- Amen.
- Thank you, Nicole.

427
00:14:31,974 --> 00:14:33,113
That'’s special.

428
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:35,598
Very special.

429
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:38,463
Let the people
stand as we begin.

430
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:42,571
Time for a little bathie.

431
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,779
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

432
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:45,608
- Name this child.
- Meilani...

433
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,301
[both]
Alexandra Matthews.

434
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,684
Meilani Alexandra, I baptize
you in the name of the Father,

435
00:14:52,753 --> 00:14:57,103
and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit, amen.

436
00:14:57,172 --> 00:14:59,277
[all]
Amen.

437
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:01,176
Meilani Alexandra,

438
00:15:01,245 --> 00:15:04,282
you are sealed
by the Holy Spirit in baptism

439
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:07,216
and marked
as Christ'’s own forever.

440
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:10,012
- Yay.
- Aww.

441
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:12,808
- That'’s so good.
- Thank you.

442
00:15:12,877 --> 00:15:15,190
[Roger voice-over]
Here we are celebrating
our daughter'’s baptism,

443
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:18,779
and it was just so surreal
to realize we'’re parents.

444
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:20,747
[Producer]
So how do you feel
about this experience,

445
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,300
from Jersey Shore until now?

446
00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:23,612
I think, overall,

447
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:25,925
this experience
has been amazing

448
00:15:25,994 --> 00:15:27,512
because looking back,

449
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:28,997
I'’m so glad
I went to the shore

450
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:30,688
to meet Roger,
to be with Roger,

451
00:15:30,757 --> 00:15:32,172
and to fall in love.

452
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:40,560
Get the [bleep] out.

453
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:46,980
[laughs]

454
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:48,844
I love you.

455
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:51,709
Will you marry me?
Is that a yes?

456
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:53,090
[laughs]

457
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,815
How'’s my little baby?

458
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:56,817
She hasn'’t moved much today.

459
00:15:56,886 --> 00:15:59,959
[Roger voice-over]
I think when I really knew
was when we had Meilani.

460
00:16:00,028 --> 00:16:01,788
You know, I mean,
every time I think about it,

461
00:16:01,857 --> 00:16:04,515
I get a little choked up.

462
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:07,276
Just bringing Meilani,
you know, into the world.

463
00:16:07,345 --> 00:16:10,452
[Jenni voice-over]
We were, like, a little heart
with a missing piece,

464
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:13,213
and Meilani was
the missing piece.

465
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:15,215
- Welcome.
- Yay!

466
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:19,461
Yay.

467
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:23,085
[Roger voice-over]
We'’re a work in progress
to this day,

468
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:25,915
but compared
to where we were five years ago,

469
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,194
I truly have my soul mate
sitting next to me now,

470
00:16:28,263 --> 00:16:29,195
you know?

471
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:30,161
Good job.

472
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,856
- Hi, how are you?
- Good. You want some Moscato?

473
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:37,858
[Jenni]
Yes, please.

474
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:41,276
We'’re having the after party of
Meilani'’s christening at Savor.

475
00:16:41,345 --> 00:16:43,864
It'’s actually next to Karma,
where we met.

476
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:44,934
Ooh.

477
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,939
Oh, my goodness.

478
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,425
- Hi, Grampy Phil.
- Hi.

479
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:54,254
[Jenni voice-over]
I think this is
a special moment for Roger,

480
00:16:54,323 --> 00:16:57,050
especially the two generations
that'’s with him,

481
00:16:57,119 --> 00:16:58,500
his mom and his grandmother,

482
00:16:58,569 --> 00:17:00,709
so this is a special
moment for him,

483
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:03,263
to have four generations
at the party with him.

484
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:08,130
So this is, like,
where it all began.

485
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,375
- Yeah.
- Way back in the day at Karma.

486
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:12,686
I was saying that.

487
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:15,551
When you were peeing
behind the bar.

488
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,970
It'’s below the place
that you peed on, so there--

489
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,249
we may actually get a little wet
in here today, actually.

490
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:25,216
Yeah.

491
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,321
He went there.
He went there.

492
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,287
Just thought I'’d get
the record straight.

493
00:17:27,356 --> 00:17:29,496
Dad.

494
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,671
So my dad'’s trying
to make jokes, and I get it.

495
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,224
You and Roger can joke all day,

496
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:35,882
but do not joke in front
of Roger'’s mom and grandma.

497
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:36,883
They don'’t get that humor.

498
00:17:39,334 --> 00:17:41,853
We met right over there
for the first time,

499
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,269
but that was it.

500
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:44,787
I didn'’t see her again
that summer, and--and we--

501
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:45,823
[Jenni]
We kept in touch.

502
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:47,204
We loosely kept in touch
here and there,

503
00:17:47,273 --> 00:17:49,551
but I think there was, you know,
some sort of seed planted,

504
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,380
and the rest is history, really.

505
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:53,693
- That was 4 1/2 years ago now.
- Wow, yeah.

506
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:55,177
I think you got the timing
a little off

507
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:57,248
on when the seed
was planted.

508
00:17:57,317 --> 00:18:00,872
- Ew, Dad.
- Oh, God.

509
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:02,046
That was horrifying.

510
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,188
Let'’s hear it.

511
00:18:06,257 --> 00:18:07,914
[Roger voice-over]
Terry definitely has a way
with words, yeah.

512
00:18:07,983 --> 00:18:09,226
It was one
of those awkward moments.

513
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:10,330
It was, yeah.

514
00:18:10,399 --> 00:18:11,780
- Is that a Bloody Mary?
- Yeah.

515
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:14,093
They make really good ones
here, if you want one.

516
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:15,542
So I'’m drinking a little bit
at the after party,

517
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:16,785
yes, I must admit.

518
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:19,684
May I have another Bloody Mary?
That was perfect.

519
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:22,722
I'’m in, like, three Bloody Marys
in and a couple wines,

520
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:23,757
but it'’s fine.

521
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:24,793
It'’s my daughter'’s party.

522
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:25,794
I'’m not driving,
so it'’s fine.

523
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:31,731
Oh.

524
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,974
Only I would spill
stuff on me.

525
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:35,942
It'’s Bloody Mary.

526
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:38,082
Can'’t take me anywhere.

527
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,740
I already got food spilt
all over me everywhere.

528
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:44,019
[laughing]

529
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:45,710
I mean, it is what it is.

530
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:49,921
I made it.

531
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,922
- Hi.
- Hey.

532
00:18:50,991 --> 00:18:52,476
- I'’m so sorry.
- How are you?

533
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:55,272
I had to manually
pump my boobs.

534
00:18:55,341 --> 00:18:56,790
But I got it out.

535
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:58,723
[Roger]
I'’ve manually pumped
my [bleep] many times, so.

536
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:00,553
- Get some food.
- Okay.

537
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:01,899
- Yeah, help yourself.
- All right.

538
00:19:01,968 --> 00:19:04,281
[Jenni]
We are celebrating
another milestone.

539
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,111
The next thing is to get
married to the love of my life,

540
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,113
and then I can just live life.

541
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:10,597
[Nicole]
So I'’m excited for that.

542
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:13,048
I'’m looking forward
to my new boob job.

543
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:14,739
- I'’m kidding.
- Oh, my God.

544
00:19:14,808 --> 00:19:15,947
I'’m kidding!

545
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:17,466
Your nipples are
gonna fall off.

546
00:19:19,296 --> 00:19:20,262
You can do the--

547
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:22,609
the speech
and cut the cake and--

548
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:23,645
No pressure.

549
00:19:23,714 --> 00:19:25,750
Well, you can set it up as,

550
00:19:25,819 --> 00:19:27,545
"Thank you all for coming,"

551
00:19:27,614 --> 00:19:29,098
thank the godparents.

552
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,755
I got it, babe.

553
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:32,964
Tell the kids
to go to the candy bar.

554
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,794
You can chime in too.

555
00:19:34,863 --> 00:19:37,521
- No. I hate speeches.
- So do I.

556
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,385
I [bleep] hate
making speeches,

557
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:42,388
so I'’m gonna stand behind Roger
and make him make the speech.

558
00:19:42,457 --> 00:19:45,805
[clinking glass]

559
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,013
[Nicole]
You have a stain
on your crotch.

560
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:48,117
I know.

561
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,878
Jenni and I just
want to take a few moments

562
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:52,018
to thank each and every one
of you for being here today

563
00:19:52,087 --> 00:19:53,709
on Meilani'’s special day.

564
00:19:53,778 --> 00:19:54,848
[whispers]
Thank the Godparents.

565
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:57,299
Oh,
and a special thank-you to--

566
00:19:57,368 --> 00:19:58,818
[all laugh]

567
00:19:58,887 --> 00:20:00,060
She doesn'’t want
to make the speech,

568
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:03,063
but she'’s gonna tap me
on the shoulder.

569
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:04,927
Roger is definitely my puppet
when it comes to speeches.

570
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:08,379
I tell him what to say
and he does.

571
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:10,036
A very special thank you,
of course,

572
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:11,451
to Nicole, the godmother.

573
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,487
Yeah.

574
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:14,937
Yay.
[applause]

575
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,007
And now we cut the cake.

576
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:18,182
- Jenni, say something.
- Shut it.

577
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,942
I hate being the center
of attention.

578
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,012
It'’s weird.

579
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:22,462
You hate being
center of attention?

580
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:23,912
- You'’re such a liar.
- I swear to God.

581
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:25,120
All right, so when you walked
into the clubs

582
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:26,328
with your tits out--

583
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:28,537
My tits were the center
of attention.

584
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:29,745
Anything from you,
or do you just want

585
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:30,850
to tap me on the shoulder
a few more times?

586
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:31,954
- Say something.
- Stop!

587
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,059
Thank you again, guys.

588
00:20:33,128 --> 00:20:34,578
- I really appreciate it.
- Yeah.

589
00:20:34,647 --> 00:20:37,857
[Jenni]
Thank you all for coming
and spending the day with us.

590
00:20:37,926 --> 00:20:41,136
As a mom, I mean, this moment
is very symbolic to me.

591
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:44,829
This is her first big party
and celebration of her life.

592
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:46,555
Four generations.

593
00:20:46,624 --> 00:20:47,832
[Roger voice-over]
Our families are there.

594
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:49,282
Our good friends are there.

595
00:20:49,351 --> 00:20:51,560
You know, these are people that
we plan on being in our lives

596
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:53,700
and in Meilani'’s life
forever, you know?

597
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:56,220
So it was just very nice
that everybody could be here,

598
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,499
and I wanted them to all know
how much that was appreciated.

599
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:01,329
It'’s a cross.

600
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:02,640
Yeah.

601
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,642
[Roger]
Now, if I touch this
to your forehead,

602
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:06,472
will it actually
leave the burn marks?

603
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,645
[Nicole]
It'’ll burn.

604
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:09,889
Do it to your wife.
She'’s worse.

605
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,408
You said my daughter
was gonna be a stripper.

606
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:12,616
You'’re worse.

607
00:21:12,685 --> 00:21:13,755
She said Satan.

608
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:14,756
That'’s worse.

609
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:26,181
- Are you nervous?
- No. I'’m not nervous yet.

610
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,838
I'’ll be nervous tomorrow.

611
00:21:27,907 --> 00:21:29,564
[Nicole voice-over]
So it'’s the night
before the wedding,

612
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:31,600
and I'’m really excited
to marry Jionni tomorrow.

613
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:33,361
I'’ve been waiting
since he proposed to me,

614
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,742
so almost two years, so it--

615
00:21:35,811 --> 00:21:38,124
I'’ve definitely been waiting
for this moment for a while.

616
00:21:38,193 --> 00:21:40,057
Remember to take it all in

617
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:42,162
because it'’s gonna
go by super fast,

618
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:43,578
and you'’re gonna wake
up the next morning

619
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:45,476
and say, "What happened?"
[chuckles]

620
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,516
- '’Kay.
- It'’ll be good.

621
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:51,896
No more Nicole Polizzi.

622
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:53,829
Nicole LaValle.

623
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:56,625
Nicole Elizabeth LaValle.

624
00:21:56,694 --> 00:21:59,110
It'’s gonna be
a very emotional day.

625
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:02,113
You'’re already crying.
Your eyes are watery.

626
00:22:02,182 --> 00:22:03,701
Please.

627
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,047
I can'’t look at you.

628
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:06,117
Why?

629
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:10,950
Do you picture me
as a little girl?

630
00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:13,124
Exactly.

631
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:14,988
[Nicole voice-over]
So I'’m talking to my mom
about tomorrow,

632
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:16,818
and it'’s an emotional,
emotional time for her.

633
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:18,958
I'’m her only child.
I'’m her daughter.

634
00:22:19,027 --> 00:22:20,994
So I understand
why she'’s crying.

635
00:22:21,063 --> 00:22:23,825
I'’ll be fine.

636
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:25,620
It'’s all good.
It'’s all good stuff.

637
00:22:25,689 --> 00:22:26,828
It'’s good stuff.

638
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:28,312
Happy times.

639
00:22:30,245 --> 00:22:31,246
I love you.

640
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:34,145
I love you.

641
00:22:34,214 --> 00:22:35,457
Hey.

642
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:40,566
[Jionni]
How does this work?
Do I take her rings?

643
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:43,120
Or does she--I'’m asking you,
and you'’re answering me.

644
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:45,847
- Yeah.
- Nicole?

645
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:47,642
[Jionni voice-over]
Tonight'’s the night
before the wedding,

646
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:48,953
and pretty much tonight,

647
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:50,783
I'’m just gonna kind of pack,
get Lorenzo ready,

648
00:22:50,852 --> 00:22:53,026
'’cause Lorenzo and I are gonna
be sleeping at my mom'’s.

649
00:22:53,095 --> 00:22:54,545
You know, I guess traditionally
you'’re not supposed

650
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:56,098
to see the bride
or hang out with her.

651
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:58,135
What'’s that?

652
00:22:58,204 --> 00:23:00,171
Do not lose those.

653
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,241
- How do they work?
- What?

654
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,278
You take mine,
and I take yours?

655
00:23:03,347 --> 00:23:05,038
Mom?

656
00:23:05,107 --> 00:23:06,315
Yeah?

657
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,111
Who holds Jionni'’s ring?

658
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,872
- Oh, [bleep].
- It'’s the best man.

659
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:12,425
- Give me that.
- Lorenzo, please.

660
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:13,944
Don'’t lose that.

661
00:23:14,013 --> 00:23:15,186
[Helen]
No, I'’m sorry. You'’re right.

662
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:16,843
Oh, mom.
Oh, my God, Lorenzo.

663
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:18,604
- It'’s all diamonds.
- Go give that to Da-da.

664
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:20,640
Why would you give
that to him?

665
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:22,366
[Nicole]
Lorenzo, please stop
dropping that.

666
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:25,162
Here. Come here, buddy.

667
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:26,370
Where'’s the ring, Lorenzo?

668
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:27,682
- No, baby, I need this.
- Lorenzo, where is it?

669
00:23:27,751 --> 00:23:28,993
That'’s daddy'’s.

670
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:30,478
Are you kidding?

671
00:23:30,547 --> 00:23:32,790
- Oh, my God.
- Jionni.

672
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,240
Da-da.

673
00:23:34,309 --> 00:23:35,793
- It'’s not in there?
- No.

674
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:38,244
You'’re lying.
I can tell you'’re lying.

675
00:23:38,313 --> 00:23:40,488
- Not happening.
- Little wedding joke.

676
00:23:40,557 --> 00:23:41,903
It'’s not funny.

677
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:44,664
You don'’t mess with beautiful,
gorgeous diamond bands

678
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:47,253
that are my wedding ring.

679
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:50,946
- Tell Lorenzo that.
- Ha, ha.

680
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:52,534
- One thing.
- Some orange juice.

681
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:55,019
Do not be drunk
when we get married.

682
00:23:55,088 --> 00:23:56,020
Why?

683
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:59,127
Like, I'’m not kidding.

684
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:02,233
You have to be somewhat
sober to marry me.

685
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:07,411
I know how boys drink
in the morning and go nuts.

686
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,861
[Jionni voice-over]
So we'’re not even married yet,

687
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,310
and Nicole'’s already
barking orders.

688
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:12,140
"Don'’t drink, don'’t be drunk."

689
00:24:12,209 --> 00:24:13,452
I mean, is this
what marriage--

690
00:24:13,521 --> 00:24:14,625
I don'’t want you to--

691
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:16,006
Is this what marriage
is gonna be like?

692
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:17,559
I just don'’t want you
to be drunk at the wedding.

693
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:19,872
That'’s, like,
a reasonable thing to want.

694
00:24:19,941 --> 00:24:21,183
My last happy day.

695
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:25,464
See you in your
white dress tomorrow.

696
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:27,604
Text me.

697
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:31,573
Don'’t be drunk
for the church, Jionni.

698
00:24:31,642 --> 00:24:32,747
[Jionni]
All right.

699
00:24:32,816 --> 00:24:33,817
[Nicole]
Bye, Lorenzo.

700
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:51,904
Morning.
How are you?

701
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:53,906
[Nicole voice-over]
Waking up,
I walk down in the kitchen,

702
00:24:53,975 --> 00:24:56,218
and all my bridesmaids are here,
all 15 of them.

703
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,911
This moment is everything
I'’ve ever dreamed of.

704
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,051
It was honestly like Christmas.

705
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,431
Let'’s do this.

706
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,331
[Joey]
Leah, can I have a big lash
for Jenni?

707
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,470
[Nicole]
Oh, Jionni goes,

708
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:07,989
"Have fun, relax, and remember,

709
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:10,163
I love you."

710
00:25:10,232 --> 00:25:11,682
He said, "You'’re gonna
look beautiful,

711
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:13,650
and I can'’t wait to say '’I do.'’"

712
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:14,961
[woman]
That is so cute.

713
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,238
[Nicole]
Like, he'’s never sweet
like that,

714
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:17,964
so I'’m just
taking this all in right now.

715
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:27,491
[woman]
Are you even nervous?
You look so calm.

716
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,561
I'’m not nervous yet.

717
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,736
I just--I want it
to, like, happen.

718
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:32,220
Is that normal?

719
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:33,428
I don'’t think you'’re
gonna get nervous.

720
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:35,188
I just feel like
I'’m throwing a party.

721
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:37,466
- One fabulous one.
- Yeah.

722
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,641
- Is that our big surprise?
- What?

723
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,505
Leonardo DiCaprio
is just gonna be there?

724
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:43,369
- I wish.
- He'’s gonna come out.

725
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:44,577
He'’s so hot.

726
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:45,923
- He wasn'’t hot to me.
- Can you imagine?

727
00:25:45,992 --> 00:25:48,029
We met him, and
he wasn'’t hot to me.

728
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:49,582
I think he'’s dreamy.

729
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:50,894
You weren'’t there.
Remember?

730
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:53,206
I don'’t think he'’s hot.
He'’s, like, sexy.

731
00:25:53,275 --> 00:25:54,932
[woman]
I agree with you in movies
and stuff.

732
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:57,176
He'’s a good-looking man.
He'’s a good-looking man.

733
00:25:57,245 --> 00:25:59,005
[woman]
Are you pumping today?

734
00:25:59,074 --> 00:26:00,110
[woman]
Oh, so funny.

735
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:01,318
Yeah.

736
00:26:01,387 --> 00:26:04,148
Just like at
the bachelorette party.

737
00:26:04,217 --> 00:26:06,323
What'’d I say again?
"Settle, Carly."

738
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:07,807
[Carly]
No, it was more like,

739
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:09,740
"If you don'’t settle,
I'’m gonna twist your nipples."

740
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:11,500
Why did I say that?

741
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:18,956
Hi.

742
00:26:19,025 --> 00:26:20,717
Hey, J.

743
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:22,028
- What'’s going on?
- Is everyone in the basement?

744
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:23,409
Yeah.

745
00:26:23,478 --> 00:26:25,653
Lorenzo and I slept pretty good
last night at my mom'’s,

746
00:26:25,722 --> 00:26:26,930
where everyone'’s gonna
kind of get ready,

747
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:28,414
relax, have a few drinks,

748
00:26:28,483 --> 00:26:31,244
and just, you know, pretty much
get ready for the church.

749
00:26:31,313 --> 00:26:32,901
All right,
so you and Joe go first.

750
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,247
You ready for a fresh shave?

751
00:26:34,316 --> 00:26:36,042
[man]
Yeah.

752
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:38,355
My brother surprises
all of us with a barber

753
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:39,736
to come over and do,
like, you know,

754
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:41,841
a nice, clean shave, and I
thought it was an awesome idea.

755
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,325
Yeah, how about Dario?

756
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:47,606
He was saying, leaving my house
after the rehearsal dinner,

757
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:49,504
he said, "Thank you so much.
The gifts are awesome."

758
00:26:49,573 --> 00:26:50,643
He'’s walking up the stairs,

759
00:26:50,712 --> 00:26:52,887
I'’m like--
he left his gift there.

760
00:26:52,956 --> 00:26:56,028
I said, "Dar, it couldn'’t
have been that good."

761
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:58,202
He'’s trying not to laugh, like--

762
00:26:58,271 --> 00:27:00,515
I can'’t wait to see Nicole
walk down the aisle in her gown.

763
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:02,068
I can'’t wait for the moment
we'’re finally,

764
00:27:02,137 --> 00:27:03,552
officially a full family.

765
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,968
- Hey.
- Oh!

766
00:27:05,037 --> 00:27:06,728
Oh, hey, oh, hey!

767
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:08,972
Hey, why are these bags so long?
Can we talk about that?

768
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:10,180
I'’m dragging
this thing all over.

769
00:27:10,249 --> 00:27:12,389
Nick, Nick,
the wedding'’s in a couple hours.

770
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:13,562
Holy [bleep].

771
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,599
He'’s got the [bleep]
bowtie on now?

772
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:17,601
[Jionni voice-over]
Cali comes walking down
with an hour left.

773
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,051
Typical Cali.

774
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,535
[Cali]
I'’ll tell you
what I didn'’t forget.

775
00:27:20,604 --> 00:27:21,709
[man]
A flask?

776
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:23,124
Huh?

777
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:24,988
This is gonna--
I'’m really a little sick.

778
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:27,473
I need some scotch immediately,
or I won'’t be able to do it.

779
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:29,337
- I got scotch for you.
- All right.

780
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:31,373
- - It'’s over there.
I'’m, like, still shaking.

781
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,065
Do I still have time
to back out?

782
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:45,387
[indistinct chatter]

783
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,182
Your mom--your mom
looks gorgeous.

784
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,944
- You look so amazing.
- You look gorgeous.

785
00:27:50,013 --> 00:27:51,600
Oh, you look pretty, Mama.

786
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,120
We got to take a picture and
put it on your eHarmony page.

787
00:27:54,189 --> 00:27:55,846
[Jenni]
Oh, my God, stop.

788
00:27:55,915 --> 00:27:59,022
I'’m gonna--I'’m gonna have my dad
join you on there real soon.

789
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:00,644
Imagine?

790
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:01,887
If our parents banged?

791
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:03,716
- Ew.
- Ew.

792
00:28:03,785 --> 00:28:06,995
[Nicole]
We would be sisters.
Oh, we'’d be sisters!

793
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:07,996
I can'’t do that.

794
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:09,308
That'’d be so cool.

795
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,381
[doorbell rings]

796
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:15,141
- Thank you.
- Have a good one.

797
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,315
You too.

798
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,941
Aww, Ronnie and Pauly.

799
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,530
Nicole, you got a delivery.

800
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:28,361
- Who'’s that from?
- You'’ll see.

801
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,949
Aww.

802
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:31,295
Wait, that'’s not
their handwriting.

803
00:28:31,364 --> 00:28:33,090
- Who wrote this?
- Well, they had it delivered.

804
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:35,748
Oh.

805
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:37,785
It says, "Dear Snooks, congrats.

806
00:28:37,854 --> 00:28:39,407
"We are so happy
for you and Jionni

807
00:28:39,476 --> 00:28:40,857
"and couldn'’t be more proud,

808
00:28:40,926 --> 00:28:43,756
"but if he ever does you wrong,
we got you.

809
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:45,654
Love you, Pauly and Ronnie."

810
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,863
[woman]
Aww.

811
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:48,554
I love them.

812
00:28:48,623 --> 00:28:50,176
[Jenni voice-over]
I'’m, like, picturing
four or five years ago

813
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:51,419
at the shore house,

814
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:53,352
when I look back
at our old selves

815
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:57,183
and I can'’t believe
how much you'’ve grown.

816
00:28:57,252 --> 00:28:59,945
- Hello!
- Party'’s here.

817
00:29:00,014 --> 00:29:04,881
[Jenni voice-over]
The thing with me and Nicole
is we had an insane early 20s.

818
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,745
Like, no regrets,

819
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:07,884
balls to the wall.

820
00:29:07,953 --> 00:29:09,713
[yelling]

821
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:11,232
[Jenni voice-over]
We had the time of our life.

822
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:17,997
Oh, my God.,
I don'’t want to pay for this.

823
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:19,654
[Nicole]
Even though when, you know,

824
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:21,173
you first met me, you hated me.

825
00:29:21,242 --> 00:29:22,415
So where is he going, Jenni?

826
00:29:22,484 --> 00:29:24,763
He'’s running away from you.

827
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:28,042
[Nicole]
We didn'’t really connect
like I wanted to.

828
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:29,319
Eventually we did.

829
00:29:29,388 --> 00:29:32,840
Who the [bleep] punches
a girl like that?

830
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:34,634
[Nicole voice-over]
And we'’ve been
through so much together.

831
00:29:34,703 --> 00:29:35,808
You'’ve always been there for me.

832
00:29:35,877 --> 00:29:37,327
You'’re like my big sister.

833
00:29:37,396 --> 00:29:40,640
[yelling]

834
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:42,194
Oh, my God!

835
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:54,068
[both]
Ahh!

836
00:29:54,137 --> 00:29:56,311
I love you, and I wouldn'’t
change it for the world.

837
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,381
Thanks.

838
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,177
So thank you
for being my bestie.

839
00:30:00,246 --> 00:30:01,454
Baby!

840
00:30:01,523 --> 00:30:03,525
She'’s so small.

841
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:04,768
My nipples hurt so bad.

842
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,666
You look just like your mom.

843
00:30:06,735 --> 00:30:09,083
[Nicole voice-over]
Me and Jenni are literally
gonna be best friends forever.

844
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,601
[Jenni]
Yeah.

845
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,465
[Nicole]
We'’re gonna be
those senile friends in the...

846
00:30:12,534 --> 00:30:13,846
[both]
Nursing home.

847
00:30:13,915 --> 00:30:16,090
- Pinching--
- Poking--

848
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,023
- Poking--
- Pinching old men.

849
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:19,887
Poking--no, young boys,
young nurses.

850
00:30:19,956 --> 00:30:21,612
Oh, yeah,
the young ones

851
00:30:21,681 --> 00:30:23,649
that are changing
our diapers.

852
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,484
[Nicole]
My dress for the ceremony

853
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:33,590
I wanted to be very traditional.

854
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:34,694
Tighter.

855
00:30:34,763 --> 00:30:35,834
Do you want it tighter,
like there?

856
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:37,145
Very tight.

857
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:38,871
It'’s poofy, and it'’s princess-y,

858
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,286
and it'’s just gorgeous.

00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:40,137

I am having a blast dancing

1545
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:01,503
[Nicole]
We can still party.

1546
00:59:01,572 --> 00:59:02,711
[Jenni]
It'’s like nothing has changed,

1547
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,195
but everything has changed.

1548
00:59:04,264 --> 00:59:05,196
We have families.

1549
00:59:05,265 --> 00:59:07,233
Pauly has a kid.
I have a kid.

1550
00:59:07,302 --> 00:59:08,648
You have two.
You'’re married.

1551
00:59:08,717 --> 00:59:09,822
Ronnie lives in L.A.

1552
00:59:09,891 --> 00:59:11,686
Deena and Chris
are settling down.

1553
00:59:11,755 --> 00:59:14,792
So to come together
like this is super important,

1554
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:16,414
and I know it means the world
to Nicole.

1555
00:59:16,483 --> 00:59:17,657
I love the fact
that even though

1556
00:59:17,726 --> 00:59:19,072
we don'’t see
each other a lot,

1557
00:59:19,141 --> 00:59:20,246
every time
we'’re together,

1558
00:59:20,315 --> 00:59:22,213
it'’s just like,
"I love you."

1559
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:24,837
Because I feel like we always
have this special bond.

1560
00:59:24,906 --> 00:59:27,046
Want to take a shot?

1561
00:59:27,115 --> 00:59:28,841
Sure.

1562
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:30,463
- At the bar?
- Okay.

1563
00:59:30,532 --> 00:59:32,016
- Let'’s all go take a shot.
- You want to take a shot?

1564
00:59:32,085 --> 00:59:33,328
I want to!

1565
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,331
- Come on.
- Let'’s go take a shot.

1566
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,472
Nicole and I have experienced
the most craziest life

1567
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:43,476
you could ever imagine
with six other people,

1568
00:59:43,545 --> 00:59:47,100
and nothing in this world
can top what we went through.

1569
00:59:47,169 --> 00:59:49,793
If there was any way to end
such a beautiful show,

1570
00:59:49,862 --> 00:59:51,242
it'’s this way,

1571
00:59:51,311 --> 00:59:54,176
'’cause there'’s no other way
to go out besides a...

1572
00:59:54,245 --> 00:59:55,384
[Nicole]
Gatsbywedding.

1573
00:59:55,453 --> 00:59:57,732
[Jenni]
A Gatsbywedding
and two babies.

1574
00:59:57,801 --> 00:59:59,699
Yeah. You'’re almost 30,
so we got to do something--

1575
00:59:59,768 --> 01:00:01,080
Shut the [bleep] up.

1576
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:05,153
You have a
30-year-old vagina.

1577
01:00:05,222 --> 01:00:07,017
- That'’s--
- Disgusting.

1578
01:00:07,086 --> 01:00:09,398
Your vagina had two kids
come out of it,

1579
01:00:09,467 --> 01:00:10,537
so it'’s not looking
any better than mine.

1580
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:13,506
No, mine looks still nice

1581
01:00:13,575 --> 01:00:15,439
like a little virgin.

We just want to
say thank you

1587
01:00:29,315 --> 01:00:31,593
for enjoying the last
five years with us

1588
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:34,044
and being part
of our crazy-ass lives

1589
01:00:34,113 --> 01:00:36,529
and enjoying it just
as much as we have.

1590
01:00:36,598 --> 01:00:37,979
Yes.

1591

You'’ve seen us at our best,
you'’ve seen us at our worst--

And at our worst.

- A lot at our worst.
- Our way worst, yup.

1594
01:00:43,018 --> 01:00:45,607
But we love you,
and it'’s a good-bye for now.

1595
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:47,126
Yes.

1596
01:00:47,195 --> 01:00:48,990
It'’s not good-bye.
It'’s "I'’ll see you later."

1597
01:00:49,059 --> 01:00:50,198
You ready, Jionni?

1598
01:00:52,476 --> 01:00:53,891
Oh, God.

All right, that'’s a wrap!

Please.

1606

All right.
It'’s done.
