did you guys ever figure out

When we get there Friday,
we'’re doing a spa,

our pool party.

Oh, I remember this place.

161
00:06:00,774 --> 00:06:04,398
I used to get drunk and, like,
dance around here by myself

00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:16,203
This is gonna happen again."

169
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:17,377
Bring it on.

170
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,930
I ordered ten for the table.

00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:02,049
Get off.

858
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:03,050
[laughter]

859
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,086
Get off.

860
00:33:05,086 --> 00:33:08,055
Get the [bleep] off.
Oh, my God.

861
00:33:08,055 --> 00:33:10,367
You know, I'’m, like,
on another planet.

862
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:12,542
I have no idea.

863
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:15,131
Oh, my God, can I get
to these [bleep] strawberries?

864
00:33:15,131 --> 00:33:18,997
I'’m so hungry.

865
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,757
[whimpers]

866
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:21,792
Please?

867
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:26,832
Carly?

868
00:33:26,832 --> 00:33:30,456
I got it. I got it.

869
00:33:30,456 --> 00:33:32,079
There you go.

870
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,288
[overlapping murmuring]

871
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:38,016
You have chocolate
all over your face.

872
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,017
I don'’t care.

873
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,089
No, I--
it looks great on you.

874
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:43,676
I think I look classy.

875
00:33:43,676 --> 00:33:45,057
With chocolate
all over your face?

876
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,921
- Yeah.
- It'’s a good look for you.

877
00:33:46,921 --> 00:33:48,267
I'’m definitely happy that,

878
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:50,476
you know, my girls
stayed up with me all night,

879
00:33:50,476 --> 00:33:52,237
even though they were exhausted,

880
00:33:52,237 --> 00:33:54,653
just to celebrate the last night
of my bachelorette party.

881
00:33:54,653 --> 00:33:56,172
Do I have chocolate on my lip?

882
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:57,380
[woman giggles]

883
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,658
There'’s a huge chunk
on her lip!

884
00:33:59,658 --> 00:34:01,591
It looks like blood.

885
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:03,110
Just trying to pretend
I'’m dead.

886
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,250
I'’m so dead.

887
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:07,666
I dead.
[laughs]

888
00:34:07,666 --> 00:34:10,634
- What?
- "I dead."

889
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:14,431
I meant to say, "I was dead."
"I dead."

890
00:34:14,431 --> 00:34:16,019
The perfect ending
to a perfect weekend.

891
00:34:16,019 --> 00:34:17,641
Oh, you guys win
bridesmaids of the year.

892
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:19,954
- Yeah, you do.
- Snug as a bug in a rug.

893
00:34:19,954 --> 00:34:22,646
Love you.

894
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,234
We'’re gonna leave her out here
like this?

895
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:25,235
- Yeah.
- All right.

896
00:34:25,235 --> 00:34:26,236
It'’s warm.

897
00:34:26,236 --> 00:34:28,031
Bridesmaids of the year gone.

898
00:34:29,515 --> 00:34:31,103
Mom?

899
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:32,035
[snorts]

900
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,351
[Nicole]
This episode of
Snooki &amp; JWOWW...

901
00:34:37,351 --> 00:34:38,973
[Jenni]
Continues now.

902
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,341
Just drinking straight
for two days,

903
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:04,343
I don'’t know how I'’m gonna get
on this Goddamn plane.

904
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:05,344
You'’re still drunk.

905
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,828
[cork pops]
- [screams]

906
00:35:06,828 --> 00:35:08,554
[Nicole]
I don'’t know
how I'’m gonna even pack my bag.

907
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:10,108
I'’m drunk,
but I'’m not a good drunk.

908
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,799
- I'’m, like, throw-up drunk.
- Yeah.

909
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:13,283
- I--
- Dead?

910
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:14,284
I dead.

911
00:35:14,284 --> 00:35:15,458
[both laugh]

912
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:17,184
I'’m glad
to see everyone alive.

913
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:21,843
[Nicole]
I'’m glad.

914
00:35:21,843 --> 00:35:23,466
[Jenni]
How are you feeling?

915
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:24,950
Like [bleep] ass [bleep].

916
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,779
Oh, it'’s wet.
What the [bleep]?

917
00:35:26,779 --> 00:35:28,298
[overlapping murmuring]

918
00:35:28,298 --> 00:35:32,060
[woman]
This whole floor is wet.
It'’s all--

919
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,684
Do you want breakfast
and see the boys?

920
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:35,926
I don'’t want to see the boys.

921
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,833
Oh, my God.
I'’m gonna die.

922
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:46,868
You'’re hurting, huh?

923
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:48,387
[Roger]
You look like death. You do.

924
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:50,424
I'’m--I'’m still drunk.
Like, I'’m not even hungover.

925
00:35:50,424 --> 00:35:52,771
I'’m drunk, like, it'’s--
it'’s--I'’m gonna throw up.

926
00:35:52,771 --> 00:35:54,324
Now I got to go fly
on a plane.

927
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,226
I feel like the walking dead.

928
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:01,952
- Ah, I look like the [bleep]--
- [groaning]

929
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,541
I feel like if I walk,
I'’m gonna vomit everywhere.

930
00:36:04,541 --> 00:36:06,578
The world is spinning,
and, yeah,

931
00:36:06,578 --> 00:36:08,718
you'’re being
a great bridesmaid right now.

932
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,135
[thud]
- Ow.

933
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:13,412
Oh, [bleep].

934
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:16,174
- Ow.
- Hit the key, please.

935
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:24,527
- Morning.
- Right here or over there.

936
00:36:24,527 --> 00:36:26,908
We'’ll sit here.

937
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:30,049
[woman]
Oop, oop, oop.

938
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:31,361
Morning, ladies.

939
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:33,329
You think that these things
are easy to control,

940
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:34,537
and they'’re not.

941
00:36:34,537 --> 00:36:36,608
- I'’m gonna go.
- Good morning.

942
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:38,817
Hey. How you feeling?

943
00:36:38,817 --> 00:36:39,956
I'’m hurting. How are you?

944
00:36:39,956 --> 00:36:41,026
I'’m gonna throw up.

945
00:36:41,026 --> 00:36:42,372
Back to reality.

946
00:36:42,372 --> 00:36:44,995
I miss my kids. I'’m ready.

947
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,963
We'’re getting married
in three weeks.

948
00:36:46,963 --> 00:36:48,965
- Less than three weeks now.
- Do you regret it?

949
00:36:48,965 --> 00:36:50,449
Like, do you still
want to marry me, or...

950
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:56,524
Or did you find somebody
out here?

951
00:36:56,524 --> 00:36:58,250
I think he'’s trying
not to talk.

952
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,011
It'’s a good bachelor weekend
then.

953
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,496
[laughs]

954
00:37:02,496 --> 00:37:05,706
What? What'’d you do?

955
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:07,294
- I'’m just laughing.
- Why you laughing?

956
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:08,778
I had a fun weekend.
I'’m just laughing.

957
00:37:08,778 --> 00:37:09,951
- What?
- Thank you.

958
00:37:09,951 --> 00:37:11,539
- [laughing]
- I'’m just laughing.

959
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:13,748
What'’d you do?

960
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:15,716
What didn'’t he do
is more the better question.

961
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:17,683
[chuckles]

962
00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:20,030
I hate them.

963
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,032
So right when the girls
get down there,

964
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,551
you know the questions
start coming,

965
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:25,208
and it'’s just like,
"What'’d you do?"

966
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:27,245
But me and Roger
didn'’t even come close

967
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,453
to doing anything
with girls.

968
00:37:28,453 --> 00:37:30,213
I don'’t even know
if I talked to any girls.

969
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:32,802
Did you get a lap dance
from anyone?

970
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:34,735
Jionni!

971
00:37:34,735 --> 00:37:36,978
Jionni, did you get
a [bleep] lap dance?

972
00:37:36,978 --> 00:37:38,739
- Did you?
- Jionni.

973
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:40,292
No, you sicko.

974
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,500
You know, I can'’t imagine what,

975
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,606
you know,
they'’re thinking in their head.

976
00:37:43,606 --> 00:37:47,126
Bad things.
Like naked strippers on you.

977
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:49,819
Me and Roger
are just messing with them.

978
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:51,199
I'’m not asking about your--

979
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:53,685
I didn'’t care what you did.

980
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:55,169
Yeah, but if you ask,
I'’ll tell you.

981
00:37:55,169 --> 00:37:56,860
- I want to know what you did.
- I don'’t care.

982
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,999
It'’s supposed to be like that.

983
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,242
It'’s supposed to be a--

984
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:01,209
I think the concept behind
coming down,

985
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:03,971
bachelor, bachelorette,
and splitting up was you girls

986
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:05,800
get to have your fun
and go do what you want to do.

987
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,974
Guys get to--
we don'’t ask questions,

988
00:38:06,974 --> 00:38:08,320
you don'’t ask questions.

989
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,046
- I ask questions.
- No, but there'’s questions.

990
00:38:10,046 --> 00:38:11,875
Well, then why didn'’t
we just have it together?

991
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:13,532
Why didn'’t we just do everything
together?

992
00:38:13,532 --> 00:38:15,362
What was the point?

993
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:17,364
We could have.

994
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:19,780
That would have been
a lot of [bleep] fun.

995
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,540
[laughter]

996
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,509
You'’re so mean.

997
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:26,269
Did you get a lap dance though?

998
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:27,443
No, I did not get a lap dance.

999
00:38:27,443 --> 00:38:28,789
Jionni, just tell me.

1000
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:32,068
I'’m not--
I didn'’t get a lap dance.

1001
00:38:32,068 --> 00:38:35,036
If you'’re standing,
it'’s not a lap dance.

1002
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:36,417
Did you dance with someone?

1003
00:38:36,417 --> 00:38:38,108
- You don'’t even dance with me.
- [laughing]

1004
00:38:38,108 --> 00:38:39,834
Jionni, did you dance
with someone?

1005
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,595
Nicole, I didn'’t even know

1006
00:38:41,595 --> 00:38:43,182
I was at a strip club,
first of all, okay?

1007
00:38:43,182 --> 00:38:44,391
I don'’t remember anything
I did.

1008
00:38:44,391 --> 00:38:45,392
Oh, you didn'’t see tits
everywhere?

1009
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:46,703
No, I didn'’t see tits.

1010
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:52,295
I don'’t even--I don'’t think
I even saw a stripper.

1011
00:38:52,295 --> 00:38:54,090
You saw boobies.
You went to the club I went to.

1012
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,506
- No, I didn'’t.
- There are boobs everywhere.

1013
00:38:56,506 --> 00:38:57,818
Boobs everywhere, literally.

1014
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:59,854
Boob here, boob there,
boobs, boobs, boobs, boobs.

1015
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:01,304
Why don'’t you ask
some of my friends?

1016
00:39:01,304 --> 00:39:03,720
I couldn'’t see, so I literally
couldn'’t look at boobs.

1017
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,067
Why, '’cause there were boobs
in your face? Nipples?

1018
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:07,034
No, '’cause I was so drunk.

1019
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:08,276
"Nipples." What?

1020
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:09,657
Did you miss me at all?

1021
00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:11,832
No, not even a little bit.

1022
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:13,212
- Did you think about me at all?
- Nope.

1023
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:18,494
[Jionni]
Club E11EVEN apparently
was a good time.

1024
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:20,288
- I don'’t remember--
- Oh, you don'’t remember.

1025
00:39:20,288 --> 00:39:23,153
So how do you know
if you didn'’t touch a nipple?

1026
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,086
All right, technically I don'’t
know if I didn'’t touch a nipple.

1027
00:39:25,086 --> 00:39:26,502
[gasps]
Jionni!

1028
00:39:26,502 --> 00:39:27,848
Don'’t say that.

1029
00:39:27,848 --> 00:39:29,539
- I didn'’t touch nipple, dude.
- Oh, my God.

1030
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:31,023
If I watch this and
there'’s nipples in your face...

1031
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:32,991
Nicole, if I touched nipple,
I think somebody would tell you.

1032
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:35,096
I'’m gonna find the girl
and kill her.

1033
00:39:35,096 --> 00:39:36,477
Ready to get married, babe?

1034
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:38,030
Three more weeks.

1035
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,895
We'’re getting married
in three weeks.

1036
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:42,345
I feel like
he'’d be more excited,

1037
00:39:42,345 --> 00:39:45,969
but the hangovers
are cutting in.

1038
00:39:45,969 --> 00:39:48,247
We'’re getting married.

1039
00:39:48,247 --> 00:39:51,147
[cooing]

1040
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:52,251
Get out of here.

1041
00:39:52,251 --> 00:39:54,322
It'’s still my bachelor party.

1042
00:39:54,322 --> 00:39:56,083
- What?
- It'’s still my bachelor party.

1043
00:39:56,083 --> 00:39:58,188
All right,
pretend I'’m a random.

1044
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:01,364
[Roger and Jenni laugh]

1045
00:40:01,364 --> 00:40:02,952
Is that what they were doing?

1046
00:40:02,952 --> 00:40:07,370
Wait, you'’re wear--you'’re
wearing way too many clothes.

1047
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,337
[Roger and Jenni laughing]

1048
00:40:09,337 --> 00:40:10,511
Get out of here.

1049
00:40:10,511 --> 00:40:11,926
That'’s what they were doing
to you.

1050
00:40:11,926 --> 00:40:14,135
I'’m ready to get out of here.
I want to see my baby.

1051
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:16,724
[Roger]
Yeah, I want to go
see my little girl.

1052
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:19,589
Let'’s never attempt
to do this again ever.

1053
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:20,970
No.

1054
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,834
Let'’s not leave
our children ever again.

1055
00:40:22,834 --> 00:40:24,939
I'’ll come back next year.

1056
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:26,354
Next year? What?

1057
00:40:26,354 --> 00:40:27,908
Jionni.
You'’re not ready.

1058
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:29,668
You'’ll be back in nine months
to see your kid.

1059
00:40:29,668 --> 00:40:30,980
You'’re not ready
to be a husband.

1060
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:32,257
[Jenni]
Roger!

1061
00:40:32,257 --> 00:40:33,638
What'’d he say? What?

1062
00:40:33,638 --> 00:40:36,192
He'’ll be back in nine months
to see his kid.

1063
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:39,437
Jionni! Jionni.

1064
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,197
Stop.

1065
00:40:41,197 --> 00:40:44,027
Stop. Don'’t tell me that.

1066
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,586
[Jenni]
Next time on the final episode

1067
00:40:50,586 --> 00:40:51,552
of Snooki &amp; JWOWW...

1068
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:52,760
I baptize you

1069
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,246
in the name of the Father
and of the Son

1070
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:57,593
and of the Holy Spirit.

1071
00:40:57,593 --> 00:40:59,284
Oh, my God, we'’re starting.
We'’re starting.

1072
00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:02,460
- Let'’s go.
- I'’m missing it!

1073
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,151
Are we saying, like, "I do"?

1074
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:05,428
[Nicole voice-over]
I'’m gonna [bleep] my pants.

1075
00:41:05,428 --> 00:41:06,602
You'’re my dream.

1076
00:41:06,602 --> 00:41:07,499
It'’s snowing!
