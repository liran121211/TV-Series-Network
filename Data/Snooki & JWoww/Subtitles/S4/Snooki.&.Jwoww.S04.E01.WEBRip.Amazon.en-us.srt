[both laughing]

165
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:52,455
- YOU WANT TO JUST PIG OUT?

166
00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:54,215
CAN WE DO NACHOS GRANDE?

167
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:55,769
- DO YOU HAVE PIZZA?
- I DO.

168
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,564
- CHEESE BALLS, FRIED PICKLES,

169
00:05:57,564 --> 00:06:00,705
CHICKEN CAESAR WRAP,
CHEESE FRIES, MAC AND CHEESE,

170
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:01,844
AND MOZZARELLA STICKS.

171
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:03,570
- DO YOU HAVE BONELESS WINGS?
- YEAH.

172
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,089
- I'’LL TAKE THAT.
- [laughs]

173
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,263
WE'’RE SO FAT.

174
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:08,851
- I'’M VERY EXCITED
THAT ME AND NICOLE

175
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:10,093
GET TO BE PREGNANT TOGETHER.

176
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:12,682
I MEAN, WHEN YOU REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT, WHO,

177
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:15,651
AS BEST FRIENDS, GET TO REALLY
EXPERIENCE PREGNANCY TOGETHER?

178
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,928
NOT MANY PEOPLE.

179
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:18,067
- I'’M SO EXCITED.
- WHAT THE [bleep] ARE YOU

180
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,448
GONNA DO IN THE BASEMENT, DUDE?

181
00:06:19,448 --> 00:06:22,347
I CAN'’T IMAGINE BEING
FOUR PEOPLE IN THE BASEMENT.

182
00:06:22,347 --> 00:06:24,142
- STOP.
I'’M FREAKING OUT,

183
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:25,868
'’CAUSE IT'’S ALREADY--
LORENZO'’S GETTING SO BIG

184
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,697
THAT HE TOOK OVER--
- HE'’S LIKE BAM BAM DOWN THERE.

185
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:30,907
- HE TOOK OVER HALF THE BASEMENT
WITH JUST HIS PLAYROOM.

186
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:31,977
AND I CAN ONLY JUST PICTURE,

187
00:06:31,977 --> 00:06:33,910
LIKE, ANOTHER CRIB
WITH ANOTHER BABY.

188
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,257
- YOU GUYS ARE LIKE THIS.

189
00:06:36,257 --> 00:06:38,398
- LITERALLY.

190
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:41,953
- LIKE, DOES LORENZO JUST
STARE AT YOU WHEN YOU SLEEP?

191
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:43,575
- YES.
HE ACTUALLY SLEEPS WITH US.

192
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:45,335
- OH, HE DOES?
- YEAH.

193
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:48,200
SO I DON'’T GET GOOD SLEEP
AS IT IS.

194
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,204
THAT MEANS TWO BABIES IN BED
IN THE BASEMENT.

195
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,104
I'’M FORCING THE PEOPLE
TO, LIKE, FINISH MY HOUSE AND--

196
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:56,312
- ARE THEY GONNA BE DONE
IN TIME?

197
00:06:56,312 --> 00:06:57,555
- THAT'’S NOT A DEFINITE.
I DON'’T KNOW.

198
00:06:57,555 --> 00:06:59,004
- I DON'’T KNOW IF THIS HELPS,

199
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:02,318
BUT THE [bleep] HOUSE RIGHT
NEXT DOOR TO ME IS UP FOR RENT.

200
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:03,906
- THAT BIG HOUSE?
- YEAH, IT'’S BIG,

201
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:05,666
IT'’S NICE, IT'’S BEAUTIFUL.
- IT'’S HUGE.

202
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:08,289
- I MEAN, NO POOL OR ANYTHING,
BUT IF YOU WANT TO MOVE DOWN,

203
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:09,498
I MEAN--
- THAT HOUSE IS BEAUTIFUL.

204
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:11,361
- YEAH, I MEAN,
WE'’LL BE PREGNANT TOGETHER.

205
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,123
- MOVE THERE FOR THE SUMMER?
- MOVE THERE FOR THE SUMMER.

206
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:17,160
I MEAN, IT'’S--
THE RENT'’S NOT EXPENSIVE

207
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,369
AND THEN YOU'’RE GONNA GET
OUT OF THE BASEMENT.

208
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:21,682
I'’M SURE JANICE
WOULD LOVE HER ATTICS BACK.

209
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:25,617
- IT'’S ONLY FOR THE SUMMER.
WE DID IT BEFORE.

210
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:26,618
I'’M DOWN.

211
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:28,620
I THINK IT'’S A FABULOUS IDEA,

212
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,380
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,
ME AND JIONNI WANT TO GET

213
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,968
OUT OF THE BASEMENT
FOR THE SUMMER,

214
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:34,730
AND ALSO, I WANT TO BE THERE
FOR JENNI WHEN,

215
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,905
YOU KNOW,
SHE'’S ABOUT TO GIVE BIRTH, SO...

216
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:40,114
I THINK IT'’S A GOOD IDEA.
- OH, MY GOD, THAT'’S SO SCARY.

217
00:07:40,114 --> 00:07:41,115
- YOU'’LL BE FINE.

218
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:42,945
I'’M GONNA HAVE TWO KIDS.

219
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:44,394
THAT'’S A LITTLE INSANE.

220
00:07:44,394 --> 00:07:46,845
I WANT FOUR,
SO THIS IS A START.

221
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:49,054
- YOUR TITS ARE GONNA BE
DOWN TO YOUR KNEES BY THAT TIME.

222
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:50,711
- THEY ALREADY ARE.

223
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,023
I PUT ON A SPORTS BRA
THE OTHER DAY

224
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:53,438
'’CAUSE I WAS GOING TO THE GYM,

225
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:55,233
ONE NIPPLE WAS OVER HERE AND
THE OTHER WAS, LIKE, DOWN HERE.

226
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,959
- [laughs]
- YOU SAW THEM BOTH POINTING.

227
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,339
THEY WERE LIKE THIS.

228
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,410
[both laughing]

229
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:04,622

00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:17,117

- SO TODAY,
I'’M GOING TO THE DOCTOR

237

AND I'’M ACTUALLY REALLY EXCITED.

238

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,986
LET'’S GET THE SHOW
ON THE [bleep] ROAD.

240
00:08:23,986 --> 00:08:25,263
- SO HOW'’S THE BABY DOING?

241
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:27,541
- SHE'’S KICKING.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'’S TAKE A LOOK.

THAT'’S THE BABY'’S HEAD,

00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:32,270
NICE AND ROUND.

245
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,927

THIS IS THE CHEST RIGHT HERE.

THESE ARE THE RIB SHADOWS
RIGHT THERE.

247
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,309
BUT THAT'’S THE BABY'’S BOTTOM
OVER HERE.

248
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,552
- AW.
- YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU'’RE HAVING

249
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,279
OVER THERE.
I CAN SEE THE...

250
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,592
GENDER THAT WAY TOO.
THERE IT IS.

251
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:45,870
- YEAH, LITTLE HAMBURGER.

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,734

- WE DON'’T WANT TO--

255
00:08:50,219 --> 00:08:51,738
- NO ONE'’S EVER GONNA BE ALLOWED
TO SEE THAT.

256
00:08:51,738 --> 00:08:52,946
- THAT'’S RIGHT.

257
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,050
- THIS KID'’S COMING
OUT OF THE BASEMENT

258
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,327
WHEN SHE'’S 34 YEARS OLD.

259
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,467
- THAT'’S RIGHT.
[laughter]

260
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:59,228
- IT'’S SO HARD
TO PUT IT IN WORDS

261
00:08:59,228 --> 00:09:03,750
WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING
THAT YOU CREATED IN A 3-D IMAGE.

262
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,684
I'’M SURE IT'’S GONNA
PALE IN COMPARISON

263
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:08,927
TO WHEN SHE'’S HERE AND
I'’M TOUCHING HER IN THE FLESH

264
00:09:08,927 --> 00:09:10,377
AND SHE'’S IN FRONT OF ME.

265
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:12,275
THAT'’S GONNA BE, YOU KNOW,
WE'’RE REALLY IN LOVE...

[laughs]

267
00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:15,520
EVEN THINKING ABOUT IT
MAKES ME A LITTLE EMOTIONAL.

268
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,246
BUT IT'’S GONNA BE EMOTIONAL,
YOU KNOW, FOR ME

269
00:09:17,246 --> 00:09:19,835
WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
BUT JUST SEEING HER IN 3-D,

270
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:20,974
YOU KNOW, IT'’S CRAZY.

271
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:22,803
JENNI IS VERY CONCERNED
AT THIS POINT

272
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:27,118
THAT SHE'’S DECIDED THAT SHE
WANTS TO SET AN INDUCE DATE

273
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:29,258
BECAUSE SHE'’S CONCERNED
THAT THE BABY

274
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:31,156
COULD ACTUALLY BE TOO BIG.

275
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:33,158
- THIS WEEK,
SHE'’LL BE 7 1/2 POUNDS.

276
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:35,160
WE HAVE A CHUBBY MONKEY
ON OUR HANDS.

277
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,231
I'’M JUST WORRIED A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE FUTURE

278
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:40,234
BECAUSE I'’M NOT TRYING
TO PUSH OUT, YOU KNOW...

279
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:43,513
- GODZILLA.
- GODZILLA OUT OF MY VAGINA.

280
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:46,171
- THE ONLY THING MORE AGONIZING
FOR JENNI THAN THIS BABY

281
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:49,899
COMING OUT HER VAGINA
WAS WHEN I [bleep] HER VAGINA.

282
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:53,178
SHOULD'’VE SEEN HER FACE THEN.

283
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:56,941
- YOU'’RE A TERRIBLE PERSON.

284
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,874
- WHAT ARE THE NATURAL WAYS
TO INDUCE LABOR?

285
00:09:58,874 --> 00:10:00,289
- WE DON'’T REALLY
KNOW WHAT INDU--

286
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:01,739
YOU KNOW, STARTS UP LABOR...
- IT'’S ALL [bleep].

287
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:02,705
- SO THERE'’S, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
THERE'’S NOT

288
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:04,396
A GOOD WAY TO ANSWER THAT.

289
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,158
HAVING SAID THAT, YOU KNOW,
ONE OF THE WAYS WE INDUCE LABOR

290
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:09,470
WITH IS, YOU KNOW,
SEXUAL ACTIVITY,

291
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,093
YOU KNOW,
THAT HELPS THAT TOO--

292
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:12,750
- THAT'’S NOT EVEN PROVEN,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

293
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,993
- I THINK WHAT YOU'’RE SAYING
DOCTOR, IS IT CAN'’T HURT, RIGHT?

294
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:16,857
- IT CANNOT HURT.
IT CAN ONLY HELP.

295
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:18,134
LET'’S PUT IT THAT WAY.
- YEAH.

296
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,757
I THINK I'’M CATCHING
YOUR VIBE THERE.

297
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:20,723
- THERE YOU GO.

298
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,729
- I AM SIX MONTHS PREGNANT
RIGHT NOW,

299
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:29,145
AND TODAY, WE MEET OUR PRIEST,

300
00:10:29,145 --> 00:10:31,423
AND WE HAVE TO JUST TALK
TO THE PRIEST ABOUT THE WEDDING.

301
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,150
I ALWAYS PICTURED MYSELF
GETTING MARRIED IN A CHURCH.

302
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,325
AND I FEEL LIKE IF I DIDN'’T
GET MARRIED IN A CHURCH,

303
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,913
IT WOULDN'’T BE REAL, YOU KNOW?
- YEAH.

304
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:40,536
- SO BOTH OF YOU,
WHAT I'’D LIKE TO DO IN A MINUTE

305
00:10:40,536 --> 00:10:43,366
IS BRING YOU INDIVIDUALLY
INTO MY OFFICE,

306
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:44,920
BECAUSE IN PREPARATION
FOR A WEDDING,

307
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,888
I SPEND A LITTLE TIME
INDIVIDUALLY WITH EACH COUPLE.

308
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:49,925
- CAN I ASK A STUPID QUESTION?
- YES.

309
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:51,685
- WHAT IF SOMEONE
CAME TO YOU AND CONFESSED

310
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,825
AND SAID THEY KILLED,
LIKE, TEN PEOPLE?

311
00:10:53,825 --> 00:10:55,862
YOU WOULDN'’T TELL ANYONE?
- I'’M NOT ALLOWED, NO.

312
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:57,726
- WOW.
- YOU GOT SOMETHING TO TELL US?

313
00:10:57,726 --> 00:10:59,693
- NO, I DIDN'’T KILL ANYONE.

314
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,557
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE
A LOT TO CONFESS.

315
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:04,491
I'’VE BEEN REALLY NASTY LATELY.

316
00:11:04,491 --> 00:11:07,425
AND EVEN, LIKE, GROWING UP,
LIKE, THROUGHOUT HIGH SCHOOL

317
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:12,913
AND EVERYTHING, I MEAN,
I WASN'’T...THE BEST SEED.

318
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,398
- I THINK AT ONE TIME
YOU WERE A LITTLE BIT

319
00:11:15,398 --> 00:11:17,021
OF A LITTLE BAD GIRL,
WERE YOU?

320
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:18,643
- I JUST LIKE DRINKING.
- OKAY.

321
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:20,058
- WHO DOESN'’T?
YOU'’RE IRISH.

322
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:21,888
- I'’M IRISH, IT'’S TRUE.
[both laughing]

323
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:23,475
- YEAH,
BUT I HAD MY PARTY STAGE.

324
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,960
YOU KNOW, THE COLLEGE YEARS.
- YEAH.

325
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,064
GOOD.
- AND I STOLE SOME THINGS

326
00:11:26,064 --> 00:11:27,238
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

327
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:30,068
- YOU DID?
- LIKE GUM AND SOCKS.

328
00:11:30,068 --> 00:11:32,208
- OKAY, GUM AND SOCKS.
- I WAS 13.

329
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,866
- OKAY, HAVE YOU GIVEN
ANY CONSIDERATION TO COMING

330
00:11:34,866 --> 00:11:36,972
TO CONFESSION
BEFORE THE MARRIAGE?

331
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:38,283
- PROBABLY NOT.

332
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:40,113
- WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO COME TO CONFESSION TO ME

333
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:42,046
BEFORE THE WEDDING?
- YES.

334
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:44,911
- TRY NOT TO HAVE PREMARITAL SEX
UNTIL AFTER THE WEDDING.

335
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:46,636
TRUST ME, IT'’S GOING TO BE

336
00:11:46,636 --> 00:11:49,122
A VERY ENRICHING EXPERIENCE
FOR YOU.

337
00:11:49,122 --> 00:11:50,744
DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THAT?

338
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,884
- NO.

339
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:55,162
- OKAY.
- IT'’S WAY TOO LATE.

340
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:57,924
- DO YOU THINK YOU'’D BE ABLE
TO ABSTAIN FROM HAVING SEX

341
00:11:57,924 --> 00:11:58,959
UNTIL AFTER THE MARRIAGE?

342
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,029
- YES, OF COURSE.

343
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:01,548
I AM GONNA LISTEN
TO FATHER OWENS.

344
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:03,930
I AM NOT GONNA HAVE
SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH NICOLE

345
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,310
UNTIL THE WEDDING.

346
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,312
- I THINK IT'’S POINTLESS.
WE'’RE ALREADY PREGNANT,

347
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:11,558
WE ALREADY HAVE A BABY,
AND WE HAVE SEXUAL RELATIONS

348
00:12:11,558 --> 00:12:13,042
BECAUSE WE LOVE EACH OTHER,
SO...

349
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:16,839
- IF A PRIEST ASKED YOU
NOT TO DO IT, YOU GOT TO DO IT.

350
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:19,566
- DO IT OR DON'’T DO IT?
- DO IT.

351
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:20,601
- SO YOU WANT US TO DO IT?

352
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:23,812
- NO, DO IT BY NOT DOING IT.

353
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:26,953
- BEFORE I KNOW IT,
I'’LL BE STANDING BESIDE JIONNI

354
00:12:26,953 --> 00:12:30,163
AT THE ALTAR, AND
HIS LITTLE HEART'’LL BE PUMPING,

355
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:31,716
AND THEN YOU'’LL WALK
IN THAT DOOR

356
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:33,925
AS A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL BRIDE.
- I'’M GONNA CRY.

357
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:35,202
- I'’M REALLY EXCITED
FOR YOU GUYS.

358
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:36,376
- I CAN'’T WAIT.

359
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:37,342
- I DEFINITELY FEEL
NICOLE AND I

360
00:12:37,342 --> 00:12:38,688
ARE READY FOR MARRIAGE.

361
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:40,483
FATHER OWENS
DEFINITELY FEELS IT.

362
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:41,726
- I'’VE BEEN WAITING
TO GET MARRIED TO HIM

363
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:43,210
SINCE I MET HIM, SO--

364
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,867
- SINCE YOU MET ME?
- FOUR YEARS.

365
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:46,041
- YOU DIDN'’T KNOW MY NAME.
- I--

366
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:49,320
BUT I KNEW YOU WERE THE ONE.

367
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,977
I KNEW IT.

368
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:55,533
WHAT'’D YOU SAY WHEN HE SAID
NO "HIBBIDY-DIBBIDY"?

369
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:58,191
- I COULD DO IT.
- [chuckles]

370
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:59,468
KNOW WHAT I SAID?
- WHAT?

371
00:12:59,468 --> 00:13:01,159
- IT'’S HARD.
HE'’S HANDSOME.

372
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,681
- HAPPY WITH TODAY?

373
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,510
- VERY HAPPY.
IT'’S GOOD NEWS.

374
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,065
- I CAN'’T REMEMBER
WHAT ELSE INDUCES LABOR.

375
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:12,412
- I STRONGLY FEEL LIKE SEX
WAS HIGH ON THAT LIST, THOUGH.

376
00:13:12,412 --> 00:13:14,621
- THE PAST FEW TIMES
WAS ENJOYABLE

377
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,243
AND DON'’T EVEN TELL ME
IT WASN'’T.

378
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:17,279
- I WAS QUITE IMPRESSED,
ACTUALLY.

379
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,659
I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD."

380
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:20,109
HONESTLY, DO YOU REMEMBER
ME TURNING THE LIGHTS ON?

381
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:22,111
I HAD TO SEE IF SOMEONE ELSE
SNUCK IN THE ROOM.

382
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:23,768
I THINK THAT YOU WERE INTO IT,
BUT IT JUST KIND OF STOPPED

383
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:26,771
AFTER THAT, SO...
I DIDN'’T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

384
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:28,359
THERE WAS SOME REFERENCE
TO HEMORRHOIDS

385
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:33,088
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND THEN
I FELT--I FELT AWKWARD.

386
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:35,366
- BEING ALMOST TEN MONTHS
PREGNANT,

387
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:40,302
I TRIED REALLY HARD TO SPARK--
WHAT IS IT, THE ROMANCE

388
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:41,959
IN OUR LIFE A LITTLE BIT?
- MM-HMM.

389
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:44,513
- AND IT WAS WORKING,
UNTIL ONE DAY,

390
00:13:44,513 --> 00:13:46,480
I WOKE UP
WITH A PUFFY BUTTHOLE.

391
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,966
[both laughing]

392
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:58,044
STOP.

393
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:00,978
- NOT--THAT'’S NOT
WHAT I EXPECTED YOU TO SAY,

394
00:14:00,978 --> 00:14:04,084
I'’LL BE HONEST WITH YOU.
- WELL, IT'’S ALREADY OUT THERE.

395
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:05,810
- LITERALLY.

396
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,192
LITERALLY, IT'’S OUT THERE.
- SHUT UP.

397
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:11,574
- THAT'’S NOT--THAT'’S NOT
WHAT I EXPECTED YOU TO SAY.

398
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:13,818
WELL, SINCE WE'’RE TALKING
ABOUT IT...

399
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,544
- IT'’S ALREADY BEEN--

400
00:14:15,544 --> 00:14:19,893
- THAT DAY THE REVELATION
HAPPENED, YOU YELLED MY NAME,

401
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:22,447
AND I WAS DOWNSTAIRS EATING
AN INNOCENT BOWL OF CEREAL,

402
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:26,003
AND YOU ASKED ME TO COME UP
AND LOOK AT SOMETHING.

403
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:28,246
AND WHEN I VENTURED
UP THE STAIRS

404
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:31,180
AND INTO THE BEDROOM,
YOU WERE STANDING THERE NAKED,

405
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:33,217
AND YOU BEGAN TO TURN AROUND
AND SPREAD YOUR BUTT CHEEKS.

406
00:14:33,217 --> 00:14:34,943
- I DID NOT SPREAD
MY BUTT CHEEKS.

407
00:14:34,943 --> 00:14:36,599
- YOU SAID, "THERE'’S SOMETHING
GOING ON BACK HERE.

408
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:38,739
CAN YOU LOOK AT IT?"
YOU STARTED TO TURN AROUND,

409
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:41,225
AND I RAN LIKE A DEER
IN HEADLIGHTS.

410
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:42,951
I DID.
I RAN OUT OF THERE

411
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:46,471
LIKE A GAZELLE,
WITH LIGHTNING SPEED,

412
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:47,956
AND I HAVE NEVER LOOKED,

413
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:49,992
AND I HAVE NO DESIRE TO,
AND I'’M FINE...

414
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:51,614
- AND THAT'’S WHY WE HAVEN'’T
HAD SEX YET.

415
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:55,101
- AND I'’M COOL WITH IT,
MAN, I AM SO COOL WITH IT.

416
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:56,481
- ALL RIGHT, LET'’S GO UPSTAIRS.
I WANT TO LAY DOWN.

417
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,173
- OH, FOR WHAT?

418
00:14:58,173 --> 00:14:59,450
- SO YOU CAN CHECK OUT
MY '’RHOIDS.

419
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,038
- THAT IS DISGUSTING.

420
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:03,350
- WELL, IT'’S WHAT YOU GET
FOR BRINGING IT UP.

421
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,111
- YOU WANT TO CHECK OUT
MY '’ROIDS?

422
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:06,215
BOOM!

423
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:07,251
- SO STUPID.

424
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,846
- WE'’RE GOING DOWN TO THE SHORE.
WHO'’S EXCITED?

425
00:15:16,846 --> 00:15:19,470
- ME.
NO?

426
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,679
WE'’LL GO SEE AUNT JENNI
AND UNCLE ROGER?

427
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,025
- NO.

428
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,620
- SO NICOLE'’S MOVING IN TODAY.

429
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,346
I'’M SUPER EXCITED.
- I AM TOO.

430
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:35,796
IT'’S REALLY BECOME
A SUMMERTIME TRADITION FOR US

431
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:38,661
TO LIVE NEXT TO EACH OTHER,
AND HONESTLY,

432
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:41,147
IT WOULD BE A WEIRD
AND AWKWARD SUMMER FOR ME

433
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:42,148
NOT TO LIVE NEXT TO THEM
AT THIS POINT.

434
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:43,425
- YEAH.
- IT REALLY WOULD.

435
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:44,564
- I'’M SO EXCITED
THEY'’RE OUR NEIGHBORS TOO.

436
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:45,634
- YEAH.

437
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,710
- NOW, HELP ME SET THESE UP.

438
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,368
SO WE'’RE SETTING UP
LORENZO'’S PLAYROOM STUFF,

439
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:57,749
AND OF COURSE, ROGER COMES UP
WITH, "LET'’S PUT SOME WORDS

440
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,132
AND A LITTLE SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE,
OR SOMETHING."

441
00:16:01,132 --> 00:16:02,271
- THERE WAS NOTHING SUBLIMINAL
ABOUT IT.

442
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,652
IT WAS IN-YOUR-FACE.

443
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:06,344
I THINK NICOLE AND JIONNI
ARE SO USED TO ME MAKING FUN

444
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:08,622
OF THEIR HEIGHT AND JUST
THEM BEING OF SHORT STATURE.

445
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:10,900
- I HOPE THEY WON'’T BE MAD.

446
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,974
- OKAY, SO WE GOT "TEENY,"
AND THEN LET'’S DO "TINY."

447
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,356
- DOES IT--HOW THE [bleep]
DO YOU SPELL "TEENY" AND "TINY"?

448
00:16:18,356 --> 00:16:19,979
- T--OH, THIS IS "TINY,"

449
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,083
SO WE WANT "TEENY."
- THAT'’S "TINY."

450
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,085
- WE WANT "TEENY,"
WHICH IS WHAT, T-E--

451
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:24,466
- T-E-E--
- T-E-E-N-Y?

452
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,433
- I DON'’T EVEN KNOW
HOW YOU SPELL IT.

453
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:29,989
I KNOW "TINY."
I KNOW "TINY," T-I-N-Y.

454
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,853
"TEENY" IS A TOUGH ONE.

455
00:16:32,853 --> 00:16:34,338
- "TEENY" HAS TO BE T-E--

456
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:36,685
I-I-I DON'’T PLAY SCRABBLE, "A,"

457
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:37,997
AND WHEN DO I EVER SAY
THE WORD "TEENY"?

458
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,069
IT'’S GOT TO BE T-E-E-N-Y,
CORRECT?

459
00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:42,760
- YEAH.
- OR IS IT I-E?

460
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,314
- T--

461
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:47,661
LIKE...

462
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:49,732
LISTEN, I DON'’T [bleep] KNOW.

463
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:51,424
DO YOU WANT TO DO "TINY BALLS"?

464
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:52,873
- THAT'’S NOT EVEN FUNNY, THOUGH.
WHAT'’S FUNNY ABOUT THAT?

465
00:16:52,873 --> 00:16:54,358
I'’VE NEVER MADE FUN
OF HIS BALLS.

466
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:55,428
I'’VE NEVER SEEN '’EM.
I DON'’T WANT TO SEE '’EM.

467
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:56,670
- [laughs]

468
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:58,224
"OH, I NEVER SEEN
JIONNI'’S BALLS.

469
00:16:58,224 --> 00:16:59,535
I DON'’T KNOW IF THEY'’RE SMALL."

470
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:01,813
- BUT I DIDN'’T GET IT.
WHAT ARE SMALL BALLS?

471
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:02,814
I DON'’T GET IT.
- I DON'’T--

472
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:04,506
- HE'’S GOT A SMALL NUT SACK.

473
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:06,128
- HE DOES?
- I DON'’T KNOW, IT'’S--

474
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:07,405
- I'’M THE ONE
ON ALL THE STEROIDS.

475
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:09,166
I HAVE THE SMALL NUT SACK.

476
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,857
- IT'’S A JOKE.

477
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:12,652
- I DON'’T GET IT.

478
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:13,825
I DON'’T GET THE BALLS.

479
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,103
- SMALL PENIS.
WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN BETTER?

480
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:16,449
- THAT WOULD'’VE BEEN BETTER.
SEE?

481
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,589
- WELL, NOBODY CAME UP
WITH SMALL PENIS, NOW, DID THEY?

482
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,418
- COULD'’VE LIVED WITH THAT.
COULD'’VE LIVED WITH THAT.

483
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:23,249
THAT'’S IT, BABY, WE DID IT.

484
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:25,423
- PUT A COUPLE TOYS ON IT.

485
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:28,530
- "SMALL, KIDS, TEENY, TINY."
- YOU'’RE GOING TO HELL.

486
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,773
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'’LL WORK.

487

00:23:08,697 --> 00:23:12,045

"OH, THAT BOY, EW, HE'’S WEIRD."

652
00:23:12,045 --> 00:23:14,358
- WELL, IT'’S JUST
SPEAKING OF [bleep] NAMES,

653
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:15,670

00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:34,033
GIOVANNA MARIE LAVALLE.

661
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:36,794
- "GIOVANNA MARIE LAVALLE."
THAT'’S BEAUTIFUL.

662
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,419
- I ENJOY THIS.

663
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,110

TO A BEAUTIFUL SUMMER.

664
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,387
- YEAH, WE HAVE TO DO IT
MORE OFTEN.

665
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:44,975
- INSTEAD OF CALLING ME
IN THE MORNING, NOW I CAN JUST--

666
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:46,217
- JUST COME OVER.
- YEAH.

667
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:47,943
- WITH A CUP OF COFFEE.
- WHAT TIME DO YOU

668
00:23:47,943 --> 00:23:48,944
NORMALLY WAKE UP?
- YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO?

669
00:23:48,944 --> 00:23:50,912
I WANT TO DO THE TELEPHONES.

670
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:52,292
- [laughs] YEAH.
- WITH A STRING.

671
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:53,708
- THAT REALLY DOES WORK?
I ALWAYS THOUGHT

672
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:56,504
THAT WAS [bleep].
- NO, BABE, THAT DOES NOT WORK.

673
00:23:56,504 --> 00:23:57,746
- HAVE YOU EVER TRIED IT?

674
00:23:57,746 --> 00:24:00,369
- NO, BUT I HAVE
A BRAIN IN MY HEAD

675
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:01,681
AND I KNOW
THAT IT DOES NOT WORK.

676
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:04,822
- WELL, WE GOT TO TRY IT.
I BET YOU IT WORKS.

677
00:24:10,379 --> 00:24:11,622
- HEY, BOO.

678
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:13,555
- MY LAST PREGNANCY,
JIONNI HAD TO PUSH MY BUTT

679
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:14,556
UP THE STAIRS.

680
00:24:14,556 --> 00:24:16,593
WHOA!

681
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:18,491
THIS IS A BIG-ASS ROOM
FOR A LITTLE BABY.

682
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,631
- I KNOW.
- MY GOD.

683
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:22,115
THIS IS THE SIZE
OF, LIKE, MY MASTER.

684
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:28,570
- ARE YOU FIGHTING?

685
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,089
- YOU SHOULD GIVE BIRTH
THAT WAY.

686
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:31,711
[laughs]
- I ACTUALLY--SWEAR TO GOD,

687
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:33,057
THIS IS HOW I WANTED
TO GIVE BIRTH.

688
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,438
- AND I'’LL CATCH IT.

689
00:24:34,438 --> 00:24:35,681
[laughs]
- I WANT TO--NO, I WANTED--

690
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:37,545
IF I'’M NOT GETTING
AN EPIDURAL--

691
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:39,270
I WATCHED A VIDEO
OF AN EPIDURAL.

692
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,825
- YOU CAN'’T WATCH THAT--
- AND NOW,

693
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:43,585
I DON'’T WANT AN EPIDURAL.
- I DIDN'’T EVEN WATCH THAT.

694
00:24:43,585 --> 00:24:45,484
- SO I'’M NOT GONNA GET ONE.
- OY...[bleep].

695
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,726
- I TOLD MY DOCTOR,
"DON'’T LET ME GET ONE."

696
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:48,556
- THIS BITCH ISN'’T GETTING
AN EPIDURAL.

697
00:24:48,556 --> 00:24:51,351
SO FEEL YOUR VAGINA
RIP TO YOUR BUTTHOLE.

698
00:24:51,351 --> 00:24:52,456
- [laughs]

699
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:54,665
- NO THANKS,
I'’LL TAKE THE EPIDURAL.

700
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:57,530
- ORIGINALLY,
BECAUSE THEY SAY GRAVITY HELPS,

701
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,981
I WAS GONNA, LIKE, SQUAT
OR, LIKE, BE ON A BIRTHING BALL

702
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:01,741
UNTIL SHE WAS, LIKE, READY.

703
00:25:01,741 --> 00:25:03,640
- I FEEL LIKE IF YOU JUST
SAT ON THE TOILET AND PUSHED,

704
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,779
IT'’D BE EASIER.

705
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:06,712
- [groaning]
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO PUSH--

706
00:25:06,712 --> 00:25:08,852
YOU SAID YOU HAD TO PUSH
LIKE YOU'’RE TAKING A [bleep].

707
00:25:08,852 --> 00:25:10,129
- MM.

708
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:11,717
IT FEELS LIKE
YOU'’RE TAKING A POOP.

709
00:25:11,717 --> 00:25:13,166
'’CAUSE REMEMBER,
I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,

710
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:14,685
I GOT TO [bleep].
BRING ME TO THE BATHROOM."

711
00:25:14,685 --> 00:25:17,792
THE DOCTOR WAS LIKE,
"IT'’S TIME."

712
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,483
I WAS LIKE,
"NO, IT'’S A TURD."

713
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:21,416
HE'’S LIKE,
"NO, IT'’S YOUR BABY."

714
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:22,935
- ARE YOU GONNA BE MORE RELAXED
THIS TIME AROUND?

715
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:24,177
- NO, I'’M TERRIFIED.

716
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:27,836
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOU HAD JANICE LAST TIME.

717
00:25:27,836 --> 00:25:29,666
YOU'’RE GONNA BE
IN THE NEW HOUSE BY THEN, RIGHT?

718
00:25:29,666 --> 00:25:32,082
- I COULD DO IT MYSELF.

719
00:25:32,082 --> 00:25:34,774
- YEAH? I CAN'’T.
- WE CAN DO IT OURSELVES.

720
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:35,948
YEAH, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

721
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:38,433
- I DID HIRE A NANNY.
- YOU DID?

722
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,262
- JUST, LIKE, SOMEONE TO HELP.

723
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:41,401
- AND YOU DIDN'’T TELL ME?

724
00:25:41,401 --> 00:25:42,644
- I KNOW BUT, LIKE--

725
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:44,577
- WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO
THAT PROCESS TOGETHER.

726
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:46,372
- I KNOW, THAT'’S WHY
I FEEL REALLY BAD TELLING YOU.

727
00:25:46,372 --> 00:25:48,547
- YOU'’RE ANNOYING.

728
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,445
- I WANTED NICOLE
TO HELP ME FIND A NANNY

729
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:52,412
BUT I TOTALLY FLAKED ON THAT.

730
00:25:52,412 --> 00:25:53,862
- I'’M A LITTLE UPSET...
- SORRY.

731
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:57,452
- THAT JENNI DIDN'’T INVOLVE ME
IN THE NANNY PICKING,

732
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:58,902
BUT I TRUST HER JUDGMENT,

733
00:25:58,902 --> 00:26:02,146
AND I JUST HOPE THAT I TRUST
THIS GIRL TOO,

734
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:05,564
BECAUSE IT IS MY BABY ALSO.
- I HOPE SO.

735
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:08,118
YOU'’RE MY BABY MAMA.
- [laughs]

736
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:11,639
SO HOW COME YOU DIDN'’T HIRE
ANY OF THE JOEYS?

737
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:13,710
I FEEL LIKE THEY'’RE GONNA GET
REALLY UPSET

738
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,919
THAT YOU DIDN'’T EVEN
ACKNOWLEDGE THEM.

739
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,161
- THEY ALL LIVE TOO FAR.

740
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:18,266
- THAT'’S THE REAL REASON?

741
00:26:18,266 --> 00:26:19,716
- AND THEY'’RE CRAZY.

742
00:26:19,716 --> 00:26:20,993
AND THEY'’RE JOEYS.

743
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:22,719
- THEY WOULD--
- KILL MY CHILD.

744
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:24,134
- YEAH.
- I KNOW.

745
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:26,412
BUT MY EXCUSE IS,
"OH, I'’M SORRY,

746
00:26:26,412 --> 00:26:28,000
YOU JUST LIVE TOO FAR."

747
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,210
- I THINK WITH THE JOEYS,
EVEN THOUGH WE DON'’T TRUST THEM,

748
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:33,074
WE SHOULD JUST BE FUN
WITH THEM ANYWAY.

749
00:26:33,074 --> 00:26:34,972
- I HOPE THE JOEYS AREN'’T
GONNA BE MAD

750
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:36,146
THAT I DIDN'’T HIRE THEM
AS A NANNY,

751
00:26:36,146 --> 00:26:38,804
BUT THEY'’RE DRUNKS.
I LOVE THEM.

752
00:26:38,804 --> 00:26:41,945
- THEY MIGHT BE A LITTLE UPSET
THAT YOU DIDN'’T CONSIDER THEM,

753
00:26:41,945 --> 00:26:44,948
SO MAYBE WE SHOULD PRETEND
THAT WE CONSIDERED THEM.

754
00:26:44,948 --> 00:26:47,226
- OBVIOUSLY, I HOPE
THEY DON'’T TAKE THAT SERIOUS.

755
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:49,400
- YEAH.

756
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,401
- YEAH.
- WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING

757
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:52,472
MORE CRAZIER.
- LIKE WHAT?

758
00:26:52,472 --> 00:26:55,890
- WE SHOULD DO, LIKE,
A RELAY RACE WITH THE BABIES,

759
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,374
BUT WITH YOUR NANNY TOO.

760
00:26:57,374 --> 00:26:59,376
SO WE COULD SAY,
"ALL RIGHT, WHOEVER WINS

761
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:00,757
IS GONNA BE THE NANNY,"

762
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:03,173
BUT YOUR NANNY IS GONNA WIN,
SO THEY WON'’T FEEL BAD.

763
00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:04,174
- OH, MY GOD,
IF SHE DOESN'’T WIN?

764
00:27:04,174 --> 00:27:06,866
- WHAT IF MY JOEY WINS?

00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:11,699

ALL RIGHT, NEXT STATION.

781
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:46,837
I KNOW THE JOEYS
ARE GONNA BE PISSED.

782
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:48,045
THEY'’RE GONNA BE LIKE,
"WHY DIDN'’T YOU ASK ME

00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:53,223
THAT WE ARE GONNA DO
A NANNY OBSTACLE COURSE

WITH THE JOEYS, BUT THEN
ALSO WITH THE REAL NANNY.

AND THEN THE JOEYS
WON'’T FEEL SO BAD.

788
00:28:00,644 --> 00:28:02,715
MAYBE WE SHOULD TEST
ON YOU FIRST.

READY FOR--

815
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,459
- [laughs]

816
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:59,151
- UM, READY FOR--
- YOU GOT GREAT BOOBS.

817
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:02,602
- OH. [laughs]
- IT'’S THE FIRST THING I SAW.

818
00:29:02,602 --> 00:29:04,501
RIGHT WHEN I SEE LINDSAY,

819
00:29:04,501 --> 00:29:06,641
MY EYES GO
STRAIGHT TO HER BOOBS.

820
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:07,918
SHE HAS GREAT BOOBS.

821
00:29:07,918 --> 00:29:10,024
LIKE, I'’M A LESBIAN.

822
00:29:10,024 --> 00:29:13,061
VERY PRETTY AND SHE TALKS
LIKE FRAN DRESCHER.

823
00:29:13,061 --> 00:29:15,201
[imitating Fran Drescher]
"HEY, YOU GUYS."

824
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:16,306
YOU'’RE THE NANNY.

825
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:17,445
YOU'’RE SUPPOSED
TO SOUND LIKE THE NANNY.

826
00:29:17,445 --> 00:29:19,274
- OH, MY GOD, I NEVER
PUT THAT TOGETHER.

827
00:29:19,274 --> 00:29:20,517
- AND SHE'’S A NANNY.

828
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:21,863
- LIKE, YOU KNOW, I WOULD--
[doorbell ringing]

829
00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:22,899
- [bleep] ARE HERE!

830
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:25,418
- OH, GOD, I CAN'’T.
- [laughs]

831
00:29:25,418 --> 00:29:26,488
- HI, BOOS!

832
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:30,285
- [high-pitched voice]
HEY, GIRL!

833
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:31,597
- ARE YOU WASTED ALREADY?
- I'’M BUMMED.

834
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:33,219
I DRANK, LIKE,
SEVEN PINOT GRIGIOS.

835
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:34,738
- OH, I MISSED YOU.
both: MMM.

836
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,257
- BE PREPARED.

837
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:37,499
SO JOEY, JOEY, JOEY, LINDSAY.
- HI.

838
00:29:37,499 --> 00:29:39,156
- I'’M LINDSAY, NICE TO MEET YOU.
- LINDSAY.

839
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:40,502
NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.
- SHE WILL BE

840
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:41,607
HELPING ME WITH THE BABY.
- IS SHE YOUR AU PAIR?

841
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:44,058
ARE YOU THE AU PAIR?
- KIND OF.

842
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:46,336
IS THAT THE WORD WE USE?
- ASSISTANT, NANNY.

843
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:47,337
- YEAH.
- ARE YOU GONNA PULL IT

844
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:49,166
OUT OF HER COOCH?
- [laughs]

845
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:50,547
- I WOULD, I'’M VOLUNTEERING.
I'’LL PULL IT OUT.

846
00:29:50,547 --> 00:29:51,859
- OH, YOU WILL?
THANK YOU.

847
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,033
- OH, MY GOD.
- WE'’RE HERE TO INDUCE TODAY.

848
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:56,035
- I'’LL LET YOU TWO CATCH UP.
- WE ARE HERE TO INDUCE LABOR.

849
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:57,174
- I'’LL GO IN THERE AND GET IT.

850
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:59,590
I'’M LIKE, "COME ON OUT, GIRL."
- COME.

851
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,662
SO WE INVITED ALL OF YOU HERE
BECAUSE TODAY,

852
00:30:02,662 --> 00:30:05,527
WE'’RE GONNA DO THE NANNY...
both: OBSTACLE COURSE.

853
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:07,184
- [laughs]
- SO YOU'’RE ALL TRYING OUT

854
00:30:07,184 --> 00:30:09,221
TO BE JENNI'’S NANNY.

855
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:11,602
- SO WAIT, IF ONE OF US WINS,
THEN LINDSAY GETS THE BOOT?

856
00:30:11,602 --> 00:30:12,983
- WE'’LL THINK ABOUT IT.
- OKAY.

857
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:15,330
- YEAH, BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW,
LINDSAY'’S THE NANNY.

858
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,849
- HAVE YOU EVER DROPPED
A BABY ON ITS HEAD?

859
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,540
- NO.
- [laughs]

860
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,335
- OH, MY GOD.

861
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:26,238
- SO WHAT EXACTLY CAN I EXPECT
FROM THIS DADDY DAY CARE THING?

862
00:30:26,238 --> 00:30:28,930
- YOU'’RE GONNA GET
SOME GOOD LEARNING EXPERIENCE

863
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:30,587
ABOUT BEING A DAD.

864
00:30:30,587 --> 00:30:34,867
YOU ARE GONNA BE PHYSICALLY
AND MENTALLY PREPARED

865
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:36,938
BY THE TIME YOU WALK
OUT OF HERE.

866
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:38,595
- SO ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO GET A GYM WORKOUT IN?

867
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:39,699
- [laughs]

868
00:30:42,357 --> 00:30:44,601
- YOU READY FOR THIS, BUDDY?
- LET'’S DO IT.

869
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:50,193
- CAN WE HELP YOU?

870
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:53,161
- THIS--
- HERE FOR DADDY DAY CARE.

871
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:54,749
IS THIS A GOOD--
- DADDY DAY CARE?

872
00:30:54,749 --> 00:30:56,026
[laughter]

873
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:58,684
- I SEE A LOT OF WOMEN HERE
FOR DADDY DAY CARE.

874
00:30:58,684 --> 00:31:01,169
- WE'’RE TEACHING
A COMFORT AND LABOR CLASS.

875
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:02,688
ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN SITTING IN ON THAT?

876
00:31:02,688 --> 00:31:05,380
- THIS DOES NOT LOOK ANYTHING
LIKE A DADDY BOOT CAMP TO ME.

877
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,141
WERE YOU LYING TO ME,
OR DID YOU JUST NOT

878
00:31:07,141 --> 00:31:08,556
DO YOUR HOMEWORK ONCE AGAIN?

879
00:31:08,556 --> 00:31:10,213
- IT SAID DADDY BOOT CAMP, OKAY?

880
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:12,491
THAT'’S WHAT IT SAID
ON THE BROCHURE.

881
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:14,320
- DID WE GET THE WRONG ADDRESS?
- I THINK SO.

882
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,735
[both laughing]

883
00:31:15,735 --> 00:31:17,323
- IT'’S KIND OF--IT'’S GONNA
PREPARE YOU TO BE A DAD.

884
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:19,670
HOW TO HELP, YOU KNOW?

885
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,982
- YEAH, WHY NOT?
- WE'’RE HERE.

886
00:31:20,982 --> 00:31:22,950
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON IN.
YOU'’RE GONNA BE PARTNERS, RIGHT?

887
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,090
- LIKE, AS IN ONE HAS TO BE--
- YOU'’RE FULLY COMMITTED.

888
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,091
ONCE YOU SIT DOWN,
YOU'’RE FULLY COMMITTED.

889
00:31:26,091 --> 00:31:27,299
- ONE HAS TO BE THE WOMAN?

890
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,748
YOU'’RE THE WOMAN.
YOU GOT ME INTO THIS.

891
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:29,888
- WHY I GOTTA BE THE [bleep]?
- '’CAUSE YOU TALKED ME

892
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,337
INTO COMING HERE,
SO THAT MEANS YOU--

893
00:31:31,337 --> 00:31:32,925
- JUST [bleep, indistinct,
bleep]?

894
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:35,652
- NO, BECAUSE YOU SAID
THIS WAS A DADDY BOOT CAMP,

895
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:37,516
AND IT CLEARLY IS NOT,
BUT THAT WOULD BE

896
00:31:37,516 --> 00:31:39,656
THE SECONDARY REASON, YES.
- [bleep].

897
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:42,590
- SO MOMS, IF YOU CAN GET
ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES.

898
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,281
- [clears throat]

899
00:31:44,281 --> 00:31:46,318
- THIS IS THE EXACT THING
THAT GOT YOU INTO THIS POSITION,

900
00:31:46,318 --> 00:31:47,802
BY THE WAY.

901
00:31:47,802 --> 00:31:49,666
- ONE OF THE BEST WAYS
TO FIND RELIEF

902
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:53,428
AND MOVE THAT ENERGY THROUGH
IS TO VOCALIZE.

903
00:31:53,428 --> 00:31:56,362
BIG BREATH,
AND JUST LET IT MOVE THROUGH.

904
00:31:56,362 --> 00:31:57,363
- [exhales]

905
00:31:57,363 --> 00:31:59,124
[laughter]

906
00:31:59,124 --> 00:32:01,747
- IT'’S EXACTLY HOW JENNI
SOUNDS WHEN SHE ORGASMS.

907
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:03,991
[laughter]

908
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:06,994
SO THE FIRST THING WE DID
UPON ARRIVING AT DADDY BOOT CAMP

909
00:32:06,994 --> 00:32:09,962
WAS IMMEDIATELY
STEAM-PLOW JIONNI'’S [bleep].

910
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:12,827
[laughter]

911
00:32:12,827 --> 00:32:14,553
[humming]
- ONE, TWO, GOOD, GOOD.

912
00:32:14,553 --> 00:32:17,245
NICE AND DEEP, NICE AND LOW.
- [humming]

913
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:19,040
[laughs]

914
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,904
- AT THIS POINT,
I'’M VERY VIOLATED.

915
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:23,631
- YOU'’RE [bleep].
- I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

916
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:24,804
- WHEN YOU [bleep] SOMEBODY
LIKE THAT,

917
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:27,048
HOW CAN IT NOT
BRING YOU CLOSER?

918
00:32:27,048 --> 00:32:28,705
- I STILL FEEL YOU.

919
00:32:28,705 --> 00:32:30,879
[both laughing]

920
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:35,056
IT NEVER FELT SO GOOD.
[both laughing]

921
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:36,851
- BAD MORNING TO TAKE A VIAGRA.

922
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:37,783
[laughter]

923
00:32:42,615 --> 00:32:44,859
- ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS READY?
all: YEAH!

924
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:47,724
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'’S START OUR OBSTACLE COURSE.

925
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:50,485
SO WE HAVE A FEW TABLES
FOR THE NANNY OBSTACLE COURSE.

926
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:52,039
ONE IS A CHANGING SECTION

927
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,318
WHERE YOU DRESS THE BABY
WHILE CHUGGING VODKA.

928
00:32:55,318 --> 00:32:57,389
THE NEXT TABLE
IS LUBED UP WATERMELON.

929
00:32:57,389 --> 00:32:59,494
- MM-HMM,
IT'’S LIKE A SLIPPERY BABY.

930
00:32:59,494 --> 00:33:01,186
- YOU PUT IN THE BABY BJORN.

931
00:33:01,186 --> 00:33:04,465
AND I FIGURE YOU HAVE TO RUN
LAPS OR DO SOMETHING.

932
00:33:04,465 --> 00:33:07,192
- AND THEN,
THE LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS WHEN

933
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:09,953
YOU SLIP AND YOU SLIDE,
BUT YOU HAVE TO CATCH A BABY.

934
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:12,300
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'’S GONNA BE
A [bleep] SHOW.

935
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,715
- HOPE THEY DON'’T GET TOO WEIRD.

936
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:16,270
ONE, TWO, THREE, GO!

937
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,581
[blows whistle]
- HEY.

938
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:19,825
- WE'’RE GONNA GO SEE DADDY
IN PRISON, HONEY.

939
00:33:19,825 --> 00:33:21,516
- DRESS THE BABIES.

940
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:24,105
- BUTTON UP.
A LADY HAS TO BE A LADY.

941
00:33:24,105 --> 00:33:25,382
- YOU'’RE BREAKING HER LEG.

942
00:33:25,382 --> 00:33:27,522
DRESS THE BABY,
DRESS THE BABY.

943
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:29,007
ALL RIGHT, GO, NEXT STATION.

944
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,043
- THAT IS NOT--JOEY!
- YOU PUT IT ON BACKWARDS!

945
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:33,632
- THAT IS NOT--YOU'’RE CHEATING.
- NO, THAT'’S FINE.

946
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:36,014
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, JOEY, VODKA.
YOU DON'’T WANT--

947
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,187
- OH, [bleep]!

948
00:33:37,187 --> 00:33:38,671
- TAKE YOUR VODKA.
YOU GOT TO CHUG IT.

949
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:39,914
- I DON'’T KNOW HOW TO MAKE THIS.
- YEAH, WHY ARE THERE ONLY TWO?

950
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:41,709
- NO, YOU GOT TO KEEP
THE NIPPLE ON!

951
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:43,918
CHUG, CHUG.
OOH, I LIKE HER.

952
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:46,886
NEXT STATION.
[blows whistle]

953
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:49,613
ALL RIGHT, PUT THE BABY
IN THE BABY BJORN!

954
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:51,615
- RUN TWO LAPS.
- OH, MY GOD.

955
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:52,892
- AROUND THE TABLES.

956
00:33:52,892 --> 00:33:54,273
- ALL RIGHT, RUN TWO LAPS,
LET'’S GO.

957
00:33:54,273 --> 00:33:55,447
- OH, NOW RUN?
- [blows whistle]

958
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:57,345
- AH!
- RUN AROUND!

959
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:58,933
GO, JOEY.

960
00:33:58,933 --> 00:34:01,625
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!

961
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,075
RUN!

962
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,973
- OH, MY GOD.

963
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:06,837
- YOUR BABY'’S ON FIRE.
- NICOLE, PARTY'’S HERE!

964
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,254
- THAT'’S NOT WHERE
THE BABY GOES!

965
00:34:09,254 --> 00:34:10,565
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT DO WE GOT TO DO NOW?

966
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:11,601
- ARE YOUR BOOBS REAL?

967
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:12,774
- YEAH.
- ARE THEY?

968
00:34:12,774 --> 00:34:14,604
- YEAH.
- JEEZ.

969
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:15,881
BABY BJORN!

970
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:17,503
[both scream]

971
00:34:17,503 --> 00:34:18,884
- WE GOT BABY GUTS ALL OVER.

972
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:21,335
[all scream]
- [laughs]

973
00:34:21,335 --> 00:34:23,337
- YOU JUST KILLED THE BABY!
- YEAH.

974
00:34:24,924 --> 00:34:26,340
- MMM.

975
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,341
DROP AND TWERK.

976
00:34:27,341 --> 00:34:28,756
TWERK IT.
- TWERK.

977
00:34:28,756 --> 00:34:31,241
- [laughs]

978
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:34,175
- NEXT STATION.
[blows whistle]

979
00:34:34,175 --> 00:34:35,521
CATCH A BABY!

980
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:36,902
[all cheering]

981
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:40,561
- WHOA!
[laughter]

982
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:42,459
- CATCH A BABY!

983
00:34:42,459 --> 00:34:44,875
- JOEY! JOEY!
[laughter]

984
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,118
GIVE ME THE BABY.
- OH!

985
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:50,157
[laughter]
- EW.

986
00:34:50,157 --> 00:34:51,261
- HE'’S LIKE A BEACHED WHALE.

987
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:53,263
- EW, JOEY!
[all screaming]

988
00:34:53,263 --> 00:34:55,403
[laughter]
- BABY!

989
00:34:55,403 --> 00:34:58,475
- THE OBSTACLE COURSE TODAY
WAS A HUGE [bleep] SHOW,

990
00:34:58,475 --> 00:34:59,925
WHICH I ENJOYED FULLY.

991
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:01,271
- ALL RIGHT SO WHO WON?
- DO YOU WANT A HOSE?

992
00:35:01,271 --> 00:35:04,378
- JENNI, WHO WON?
WHO'’S THE ULTIMATE NANNY?

993
00:35:04,378 --> 00:35:05,413
- YOU WON.

994
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:06,656
- SO JOEY'’S YOUR REAL NANNY?

995
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:09,107
- NO, LINDSAY IS PERFECT
AT WHAT SHE DOES.

996
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,109
- ALL RIGHT, LINDSAY YOU CAN
WATCH THE BABY WHEN WE'’RE DRUNK.

997
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,524
- EXACTLY,
WHICH WILL BE EVERY DAY.

998
00:35:12,524 --> 00:35:13,628
- ALL RIGHT.
[laughs]

999
00:35:13,628 --> 00:35:15,113
- THERE WE GO.
- OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD.

1000
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,080
- YOU CAN JUST BE THE UNCLES.
- OH, MY GOD!

1001
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,703
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH, MY GOD, POOR BABY.

1002
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:20,980
- YOU'’RE DEFINITELY GONNA KEEP
THAT BABY NOW.

1003
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,292
- YOU'’RE JUST THE UNCLE JOEYS.
- OH, MY GOD.

1004
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:24,398
- IT'’S A BABY BJORN.
IT'’S A NEW DESIGN.

1005
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:26,641
- UGH!
I DIE.

1006
00:35:26,641 --> 00:35:30,335
I FEEL LIKE IT'’S NOT A PARTY
UNTIL WE SEE BEAR JOEY'’S PENIS.

1007
00:35:30,335 --> 00:35:31,784
- MM-HMM.
- AND PUBES.

1008
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:33,407
YOU GUYS DID GOOD.
I'’M PROUD OF YOU.

1009
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:35,650
- PUT YOUR PENIS AWAY.

1010
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:37,825
- [laughs]

1011
00:35:41,587 --> 00:35:43,900
- SO YOU'’RE GONNA PUT IT AROUND
YOUR NECK LIKE A LONG SCARF.

1012
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,315
- OHH.

1013
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:48,076
- AND YOU'’RE GOING TO GRAB
ONTO THE SCARF

1014
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:50,976
AS YOU SQUAT DOWN.
- HOLD ON, WAIT.

1015
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:52,909
- THERE YOU GO.

1016
00:35:55,014 --> 00:35:57,431
- I'’VE NEVER BEEN
THAT CLOSE TO BRACIOLE.

1017
00:35:57,431 --> 00:36:00,054
THAT BRACIOLEWAS
PRETTY MUCH INSIDE ME.

1018
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:01,849
MY HEAD WAS EYE LEVEL
WITH YOUR SACK.

1019
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:04,058
IT WAS A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

1020
00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:05,266
- AM I THE BIGGEST
YOU'’VE EVER HAD?

1021
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:06,543
- BY FAR.

1022
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:09,063
- ONE OF THE MOST
MESMERIZING EXPERIENCES

1023
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:11,169
AND ONE OF THE GREATEST COMFORTS
FOR LABOR

1024
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,205
IS STARING
INTO YOUR PARTNER'’S EYES.

1025
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:15,621
SO FACE YOUR PARTNER.

1026
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:18,900
LADIES, THROW YOUR HANDS
AROUND YOUR HUSBAND'’S NECK,

1027
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,593
AND I WANT YOU TO LOCK EYES.

1028
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:24,699
AND NOW, WHILE YOU'’RE LOOKING
AT EACH OTHER, BE ENCOURAGING.

1029
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:27,046
YOU SAY THINGS LIKE
"YOU'’RE SO AMAZING.

1030
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:28,807
"YOU'’RE GONNA BE
A WONDERFUL MOTHER.

1031
00:36:28,807 --> 00:36:30,153
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL."
[both laughing]

1032
00:36:30,153 --> 00:36:32,673
- TELL ME, BUDDY.
- PUSH MY KID OUT.

1033
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:34,744
PUSH.
PUSH.

1034
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:36,987
- WHAT ELSE?
- UM...

1035
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,092
I LOVE YOU.

1036
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:39,921
- WHAT ELSE?
- MORE THAN WORDS CAN SAY.

1037
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:42,717
- YOU MAKE ME FEEL
SO COMFORTABLE.

1038
00:36:42,717 --> 00:36:46,445
- BABY, THIS SHALL PASS.
WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS.

1039
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:48,033
JUST BITE DOWN
ON YOUR BOTTOM LIP

1040
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:50,208
AND PUSH MY KID OUT.
- [laughs]

1041
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,968
COULDN'’T DO IT WITHOUT YOU.
- I KNOW.

1042
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:53,383
I'’M HERE FOR YOU.

1043
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:55,730
- I MEAN, AT ONE POINT,
ROGER WAS TELLING ME,

1044
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,076
YOU KNOW, I'’M BEAUTIFUL.

1045
00:36:57,076 --> 00:36:59,009
YOU KNOW,
I MAKE HIM FEEL COMFORTABLE,

1046
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,597
YOU KNOW, WE DID HAVE
A MOMENT, YOU KNOW, I--

1047
00:37:00,597 --> 00:37:01,840
- YOU COMPLETE ME.
- I COMPLETE YOU--

1048
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,186
- YOU HAD ME AT HELLO.

1049
00:37:03,186 --> 00:37:05,050
- YOU KNOW, THAT WAS KIND OF,
YOU KNOW, SOOTHING.

1050
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,154
I KIND OF ENJOYED THAT.

1051
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:08,191
IT WAS PRETTY ROMANTIC
FOR A SECOND.

1052
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:09,434
BUT THEN, YOU KNOW,

1053
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:11,608
I WENT BACK TO REALITY
AND SAW, YOU KNOW,

1054
00:37:11,608 --> 00:37:14,577
FELT HIS GUN DIGGING
INTO MY HIP A LITTLE BIT

1055
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:17,856
AND CUT BACK TO WEIRD.

1056
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:19,789
- WE DON'’T TALK ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED BACK THERE, ALL RIGHT.

1057
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:22,170
- YEAH, OKAY.
- EVER.

1058
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,965
I DON'’T--DO YOU HAVE
A KNIFE ON YOU?

1059
00:37:23,965 --> 00:37:25,139
I'’D LIKE TO--
- SOMETHING,

1060
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:26,968
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
- SHAKE ON--

1061
00:37:26,968 --> 00:37:29,143
A BLOOD SHAKE THAT WE NEVER
TALK ABOUT THIS

1062
00:37:29,143 --> 00:37:30,386
EVER, EVER AGAIN.
- BLOOD SHAKE?

1063
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:32,319
WE ALREADY DID
A PRETTY GOOD SHAKE BEFORE.

1064
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:34,044
- IT'’S TRUE.
BASICALLY, IF I HAVE ANYTHING,

1065
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:35,287
YOU'’VE GOT IT AT THIS POINT,
SO--

1066
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:36,806
[both laughing]

1067
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:38,428
- WE SHAKED GOOD ENOUGH BEFORE.

1068
00:37:38,428 --> 00:37:40,810
WE'’RE ABOVE BLOOD BROTHERS,
SO...

1069
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,950
WHATEVER HAPPENS
AT DADDY BOOT CAMP--

1070
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,089
- WE DON'’T TALK ABOUT.

1071
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:45,780
- YOU ASKED ME WHAT TO EXPECT.

1072
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,369
I SAID IT'’S GONNA CHANGE YOU
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY.

1073
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:50,302
- YEAH, WELL...
- AND IT DID.

1074
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:52,270
- APPARENTLY,
IT TURNED ME GAY AS WELL.

1075
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:56,619
- THIS EPISODE
OF SNOOKI AND JWOWW--

1076
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:59,518
- CONTINUES NOW.

1077
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,045
- WHO WANTS SOME ICE CREAM?

1078
00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:10,080
LORENZO,
YOU WANT SOME ICE CREAM?

1079
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,772
- WHO WANTS ICE CREAM?
ME.

1080
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:13,912
THIS IS LIVING.
I COULD DO THIS EVERY NIGHT.

1081
00:38:13,912 --> 00:38:16,155
- MM-HMM, WE SHOULD DO IT.

1082
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:17,709
- WE DO S'’MORES ALL THE TIME.
- PERIODICALLY.

1083
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:19,573
- WE LOVE--
[shatters]

1084
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:20,746
- [laughs]

1085
00:38:20,746 --> 00:38:21,920
- SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE.

1086
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,784
- WE LOVE S'’MORES.

1087
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:26,062
- AND WE'’RE BACK.
- AND WE'’RE BACK.

1088
00:38:26,062 --> 00:38:27,684
- IT'’S GONNA BE A LONG SUMMER.

1089
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:29,445
- WE'’RE GONNA NEED
A LOT OF DISHES.

1090
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:31,550
- I STILL CAN'’T GET OVER
WHEN HE TURNS TWO,

1091
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:34,691
WHEREVER WE HAVE HIS BIRTHDAY,
SHE WILL BE THERE.

1092
00:38:34,691 --> 00:38:40,145
- SOMETIME SOON WE COULD HAVE
SOME S'’MORES WITH LORENZO AND--

1093
00:38:40,145 --> 00:38:41,629
- MEILANI.
all: MEILANI.

1094
00:38:41,629 --> 00:38:43,010
- LITTLE MEILANI.

1095
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,632
- I HAVE A SERIOUS QUESTION.
- YES.

1096
00:38:44,632 --> 00:38:49,188
- WOULD YOU EVER LET MEILANI
GO ON A DATE WITH LORENZO?

1097
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:51,156
- OF COURSE.
- I WOULD ALMOST--

1098
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:53,123
I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS
ARE MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

1099
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:54,366
- I ALMOST--
- I FEEL LIKE THEY'’D BE COUSINS,

1100
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:55,781
RIGHT?
- YEAH, IT'’D BE LIKE INCEST.

1101
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:57,058
I DON'’T KNOW.
- THEY'’D BE CLOSE FRIENDS

1102
00:38:57,058 --> 00:38:58,370
THAT ALWAYS HOOK UP.

1103
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,889
- OH.
- THAT WOULD--OH, MY GOD.

1104
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:01,822
- NOW YOU'’RE JUST BEING CREEPY.
- NOW I'’M GETTING PISSED.

1105
00:39:01,822 --> 00:39:03,341
- I KNOW.

1106
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,273
MY DAUGHTER IS A HOOK UP?
- I DON'’T KNOW IF I WANT THAT.

1107
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:08,691
I HONESTLY WOULDN'’T MIND
IF LORENZO AND MEILANI DATED.

1108
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:12,004
- I PICTURE, LIKE, TOM CRUISE
AND KATIE HOLMES, THOUGH.

1109
00:39:12,004 --> 00:39:13,420
- YEAH, '’CAUSE HE'’S SO SHORT.
- [laughs]

1110
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,145
- MEILANI?

1111
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:17,216
- LORENZO'’S GONNA BE TINY,
AND MEILANI'’S PROBABLY GONNA BE

1112
00:39:17,216 --> 00:39:18,666
THIS HUGE MODEL.

1113
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:21,048
WHAT IF WE WALKED IN ON THEM
HOOKING UP FOR THE FIRST TIME?

1114
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:22,152
I WOULD CRY.

1115
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:23,637
[imitates vomiting]
EW.

1116
00:39:23,637 --> 00:39:25,328
I CAN'’T EVEN THINK ABOUT THAT.
HE'’S, LIKE, A BABY.

1117
00:39:25,328 --> 00:39:26,881
- [laughs]
- STOP.

1118
00:39:26,881 --> 00:39:29,021
- STOP. EW.
- EW.

1119
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:31,541
- YOU GOT TO SEE
THE BASEMENT I DESIGNED.

1120
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:33,129
IT'’S PRETTY COOL.
I FOUND SOME INTEREST

1121
00:39:33,129 --> 00:39:34,855
IN, LIKE, DOING STUFF LIKE THAT.
- GOOD DEAL, MAN.

1122
00:39:34,855 --> 00:39:36,788
MAYBE YOU'’LL BE
AN INTERIOR DESIGNER ONE DAY.

1123
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:37,996
- YOU SHOULD BE A CONSTRUCTOR,
THAT'’S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE.

1124
00:39:37,996 --> 00:39:39,653
- I'’M MORE, LIKE--
- A CONSTRUCTOR?

1125
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:40,792
- YEAH.
- A CONSTRUCTOR?

1126
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:43,346
- WHY'’RE YOU LAUGHING?
- A CONTRACTOR?

1127
00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:45,590
[laughter]

1128
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:48,040
- OR YOU SHOULD BE
A CONSTRUCTOR--

1129
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,179
- WHAT'’S A CONSTRUCTOR--

1130
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,526
- JUST EVERY DAY--
- A CONSTRUCTOR?

1131
00:39:50,526 --> 00:39:52,148
- WHAT'’S A CONSTRUCTOR?
- JUST GET OUT LEGOS EVERY DAY.

1132
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:53,529
- WHAT'’S A CONSTRUCTOR?
- OH, MY GOD.

1133
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:54,909
- IS THAT SOMEBODY
THAT DOES THIS?

1134
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:57,636
[laughter]

1135
00:39:57,636 --> 00:40:00,536
- I THINK THIS SUMMER'’S
GONNA BE VERY MEMORABLE.

1136
00:40:00,536 --> 00:40:01,813
- YEAH, YOU'’RE HAVING A KID.

1137
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:04,367
- YEAH, BUT, LIKE, EVERYTHING,
THE WHOLE SUMMER.

1138
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:06,058
- GONNA BE A GOOD SUMMER, GUYS.
- AW.

1139
00:40:06,058 --> 00:40:08,095
- I DON'’T KNOW, YOU THINK
WE CAN TOP LAST SUMMER?

1140
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:09,855
