00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:17,972
[Snooki]
I don'’t feel it.

176
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:19,215
[nurse]
You don'’t have to.

177
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:20,527
It'’s time, guys.

178
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:21,666
[Snooki]
And I'’m basically there,

179
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,702
ten centimeters,
and it'’s time to push.

180
00:05:23,702 --> 00:05:25,808
[Janis]
They'’re waiting for you.

181
00:05:25,808 --> 00:05:28,086
- This one?
- Yeah.

182
00:05:28,086 --> 00:05:29,087
Nicole?

183
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:30,295
- Mommy.
- Hi.

184
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:31,469
[Snooki]
And once my mom
got into the room,

185
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,056
it was time to push.

186
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:37,509
Thank God that I could have
my mom again by my side.

187
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,339
[Snooki]
Ohh.

188
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,512
[Snooki]
I can'’t.

189
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:42,376
- You'’re okay.
- I can'’t.

190
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,067
[nurse]
So you just
finished a contraction.

191
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,622
[nurse]
Wait for the next contraction,
Nicole.

192
00:05:46,622 --> 00:05:47,761
- Did you just look?
- No, I didn'’t look.

193
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:48,831
[laughter]
[Snooki]
Did you see her?

194
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:49,832
[Jionni]
I didn'’t look.

195
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:51,247
[nurse]
She'’s got dark hair!

196
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,835
[Snooki]
I feel something moving.

197
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:53,836
[nurse]
Keep coming.

198
00:05:53,836 --> 00:05:55,355
I do my first push,

199
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,566
and I feel her head
just coming out,

200
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:01,499
and I just feel my vagina,

201
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,949
like, expand and I'’m like,

202
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:05,641
"Oh, my God, ew."

203
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:07,884
[nurse]
Okay, good, three, four,
here we go.

204
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:09,507
- [moans]
- Stop pushing now.

205
00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:11,336
[Dr. Russo]
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Baby'’s head'’s out.

206
00:06:11,336 --> 00:06:15,616
I push again, and Giovanna'’s,
like, butt comes out,

207
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:18,826
and then I push one more time,
and Giovanna'’s out.

208
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:19,827
[baby crying]

209
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:20,863
There she is.

210
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:22,312
- There she is.
- There she is.

211
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:23,313
Congratulations.

212
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:24,349
Yeah, same here.

213
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:26,696
- Oh.
- You did fantastic.

214
00:06:26,696 --> 00:06:27,697
[nurse]
She'’s too much.

215
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:29,147
[Dr. Russo]
A lot of hair.

216
00:06:29,147 --> 00:06:30,873
- Yes.
- A lot of hair.

217
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,184
And I'’m like, "Yay."

218
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:34,428
And I'’m so [bleep] happy.

219
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,809
I love my baby.

220
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:40,123
I love my kids.

221
00:06:40,123 --> 00:06:43,057
I'’m happy.

222
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,029
I love you.

223
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:53,689
Mm.

224
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,864
You'’re so pretty.

225
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:59,626
Giovanna'’s here, and it'’s just--

226
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:01,386
it makes our family
even more complete,

227
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:03,664
and she was the missing piece
of the puzzle,

228
00:07:03,664 --> 00:07:05,804
and we just have
an awesome, awesome family.

229
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:08,980
- Aw.
- Can you see?

230
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,981
- She came out okay?
- Yeah.

231
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:10,982
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

232
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:12,190
- Three pushes, boom.
- Really?

233
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,191
- And that'’s it.
- Wow.

234
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:15,089
- Congratulations.
- [laughs]

235
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:16,712
- Congratulations to you.
- She'’s beautiful.

236
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:17,713
- She looks like Lorenzo.
- Right?

237
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:19,473
Yeah.

238
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:21,199
You know, the excitement
of seeing your daughter

239
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,338
kind of just
overtakes everything.

240
00:07:22,338 --> 00:07:23,512
It just, as soon as you see her,

241
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:26,273
you'’re just, like,
you know, it'’s awesome.

242
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:27,377
- Mm-hmm.
- It'’s, like, you know--

243
00:07:27,377 --> 00:07:29,172
it'’s that feeling,
nothing else matters.

244
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,519
Like, everything you--the house,

245
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,934
I forgot about
we'’re building a house.

246
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:32,969
I forgot about, you know,

247
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:34,902
us having a wedding.
Like, it was just her.

248
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:37,111
Yeah, screw the wedding.
We got a little baby.

249
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:39,700
[Jionni]
So everything else kind of
was second to us,

250
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,254
and she was just, you know,
first.

251
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,877
Now I have two girls
to take care of.

252
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,361
Two princesses.

253
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:46,914
And a beast.

254
00:07:46,914 --> 00:07:49,054
And a beast.

255
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:51,471
Make sure no boys
pick you up in the nursery.

256
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,074
- Da.
- What?

257
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:11,042
I want Mama at the house.

258
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,215
[Jionni]
Do you want to go see mama?

259
00:08:12,215 --> 00:08:14,010
- And--
- You want to see your sister?

260
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,116
- Yeah.
- Okay.

261
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,876
Come on, buddy.
Go see your sister.

262
00:08:17,876 --> 00:08:19,775
[Jionni]
I'’m taking Lorenzo back
to the hospital.

263
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,431
Our family'’s gonna
be together for the first time,

264
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:23,123
and he'’s wearing
his big brother shirt,

265
00:08:23,123 --> 00:08:24,849
and I want Nicole to see Lorenzo

266
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:26,126
'’cause she definitely
misses him.

267
00:08:26,126 --> 00:08:28,473
[gasps]
I hear Da-Da.

268
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,889
Lorenzo'’s gonna meet his sister
for the first time,

269
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:33,271
and I'’m a little nervous.

270
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:35,238
[Snooki]
It'’s like, I don'’t want
to hurt his feelings

271
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:37,827
because he was my first kid.

272
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:41,762
[sniffles]

273
00:08:41,762 --> 00:08:45,766
Lorenzo, it'’s mama.

274
00:08:45,766 --> 00:08:47,043
- Come on.
- I just don'’t want to

275
00:08:47,043 --> 00:08:48,458
neglect him.

276
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:51,945
That'’s--that'’s what I'’m worried
about, honestly,

277
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,223
as a parent of two.

278
00:08:54,223 --> 00:08:58,020
Like, I don'’t know how
I'’m gonna,

279
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,367
like, divvy up my time.

280
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:01,955
[Snooki]
Lorenzo?

281
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:03,439
Lorenzo, it'’s Mommy.

282
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:04,854
[Snooki]
Hi.

283
00:09:04,854 --> 00:09:06,304
[Snooki]
Are you a big brother?

284
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:08,478
- Aww.
- Baby, come here, I missed you.

285
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:09,997
- Come see Mama.
- He picked you out flowers.

286
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:11,309
[woman]
Check it out, bud.

287
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:14,243
[gasps]
Thank you, baby.

288
00:09:14,243 --> 00:09:15,865
[laughs]

289
00:09:15,865 --> 00:09:18,419
- Lorenzo.
- Lorenzo, where'’s sissy?

290
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:21,319
- Your sister.
- Lorenzo, where'’s sissy?

291
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,633
- Yeah, that'’s sissy.
- Aww, yeah.

292
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:25,979
You want to give your sister
a kiss right here?

293
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:30,017
- Lorenzo, this is sissy.
- Give your sister a kiss.

294
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:32,123
- Aww, good job, buddy.
- Aww.

295
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:36,576
This is definitely a moment
I want to cherish forever.

296
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:37,646
This is your sister.

297
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:46,516
[Snooki]
I'’m gonna call Jenni.

298
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:49,416
I haven'’t told her
we gave birth yet.

299
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,073
[phone ringing]

300
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:52,799
Can you answer that?

301
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,249
It'’s Nicole.

302
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:57,182
Oh, she'’s Facetiming.

303
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,602
Ooh, I look like [bleep].

304
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,604
Hello.

305
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,675
I'’m so tired.

306
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:07,710
[JWOWW]
Why?

307
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,298
I just gave birth.

308
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:13,820
You'’re lying.

309
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,200
Do you want to see her?

310
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,374
[JWOWW]
Yes.
Come over here.

311
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:18,031
She'’s sleeping right now.

312
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:19,549
Let me flip this around.

313
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:20,827
Oh, my god, she really is.

314
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:21,966
[Roger]
No way.

315
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:23,277
- Congratulations.
- Do you guys see her?

316
00:10:23,277 --> 00:10:25,348
Congratulations.

317
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:26,902
[JWOWW]
Oh, my god,
I love that headpiece.

318
00:10:26,902 --> 00:10:28,041
She'’s perfect.

319
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,284
- Right?
- She is.

320
00:10:30,284 --> 00:10:31,838
[JWOWW]
She'’s sleeping nice and snug?

321
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:33,702
[JWOWW]
Oh, my God,
look at Jionni sleeping.

322
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:35,324
[Snooki]
Sorry I didn'’t tell you.

323
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:40,950
It happened last night, so I'’ve
literally been up for 24 hours,

324
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,676
and I feel insane,

325
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:45,023
and my butthole hurts.

326
00:10:45,023 --> 00:10:48,095
[laughs]

327
00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:50,166
Roger just made her a tutu.

328
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,652
Oh, a tutu?
Is that Meilani'’s?

329
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,137
[JWOWW]
We actually made that tutu
for Meilani,

330
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:58,416
and it'’s way too small, so
we'’re gonna give it to Giovanna.

331
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,211
All right, we'’ll take it.

332
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,730
I love you.

333
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,110
I'’m so proud of you.

334
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,456
I'’ll see you guys tomorrow?

335
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,803
[Roger]
Congratulations.
Get some sleep.

336
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:06,804
[JWOWW]
Congratulations.

337
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:07,977
All right, love you.

338
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,911
Love you, I can'’t wait
to see you tomorrow.

339
00:11:10,911 --> 00:11:12,085
Okay, bye.

340
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:13,086
[JWOWW]
Bye.

341
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:16,158
[Roger]
Bye.

342
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:17,918
How'’s our little peanut?
Doing good?

343
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:19,092
Yeah.
Oh, my god, they'’re gonna--

344
00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:20,438
she'’s gonna look
like a beast next to her.

345
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:22,267
Our baby'’s gonna
try to eat their baby.

346
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:25,098
Oh, my God, stop.

347
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:27,134
Good night, baby.

348
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:28,342
Good night, baby girl.

349
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:29,343
Good night.

350
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:31,725
Good night.

351
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:32,726
Good work today.

352
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:33,727
Thanks, babe.

353
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:36,040
I'’m proud of you.

354
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,455
You sure you don'’t want
to sleep in bed with me?

355
00:11:37,455 --> 00:11:38,974
God bless you.

356
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:40,941
Let'’s make another baby
right now.

357
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:43,012
I'’m not touching
your swollen vagina.

358
00:11:43,012 --> 00:11:44,255
You'’re bleeding.
There'’s blood on your bed.

359
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,256
[laughs]

360
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:46,326
That'’s gross.

361
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:49,363
You'’re so rude.

362
00:11:49,363 --> 00:11:51,124
[sighs]

363
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:55,093
Oh, my stomach'’s going down.

364
00:11:55,093 --> 00:11:56,439
I can fit in that wedding dress.

365
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:57,544
Oh, god.
Here we go.

366
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:09,004
[baby cooing]

367
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:10,833
Yeah.

368
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,698
[baby cooing]

369
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:14,837
[knocking]

370
00:12:14,837 --> 00:12:16,701
both: Hi.

371
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,807
Congratulations.

372
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,740
- Thank you.
- It'’s like deja vu.

373
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,327
[Snooki]
Jenni and Roger are
visiting today,

374
00:12:22,327 --> 00:12:23,466
and I'’m really, really excited

375
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:25,814
because she'’s gonna
meet Giovanna,

376
00:12:25,814 --> 00:12:28,195
and I feel like
she'’s gonna fall in love.

377
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:29,921
Do you want to hold her?

378
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:31,371
Hi, baby.

379
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:33,511
- I'’m nervous.
- Do you remember?

380
00:12:33,511 --> 00:12:35,237
- Look at her little feet.
- Oh, my God.

381
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:36,928
You look just like your mommy.

382
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:37,964
My nipples hurt so bad.

383
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:39,310
[JWOWW]
Babe, you got to take pictures.

384
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,485
[JWOWW]
Seeing Giovanna
for the first time is honestly,

385
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:44,453
it, like,
makes your heart skip a beat

386
00:12:44,453 --> 00:12:45,592
'’cause she'’s so beautiful.

387
00:12:45,592 --> 00:12:46,800
She looks like Lorenzo.

388
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,975
She looks like Lorenzo.
She'’s tanner than me--

389
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,183
[Snooki]
And she has
better hair than you.

390
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:53,531
I know.
She'’s, like, she'’s perfect.

391
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:55,222
Look at that knee.

392
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:57,880
The vagina'’s not that bad
like I thought it would be.

393
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,985
- Ew.
- Ew, I know.

394
00:12:58,985 --> 00:13:01,401
- I think about that sometimes.
- [laughs]

395
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:02,782
- You get used to it.
- Yeah.

396
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,750
[Snooki]
I have to get used
to Giovanna'’s vagina

397
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,752
because obviously
I'’m used to a wiener.

398
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,029
An outie?

399
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,168
[Snooki]
With a vagina, you have to,

400
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:11,238
like, get into the creases.

401
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:12,895
You have to wipe a certain way.

402
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:14,863
[Snooki]
With Lorenzo'’s wiener,
you could just wipe whatever,

403
00:13:14,863 --> 00:13:15,864
and, you know, that'’s it.

404
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:17,762
So, I feel like with the vagina,

405
00:13:17,762 --> 00:13:19,937
it'’s definitely
more complicated.

406
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:21,801
Did you change a diaper yet?

407
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,802
Yeah,
but there wasn'’t any poop.

408
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,700
[Jionni]
I just pulled out a guck.

409
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,116
[JWOWW]
Oh, yeah, the vernix will be
stuck in there for a while.

410
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,462
[JWOWW]
It'’s actually a good protector.

411
00:13:28,462 --> 00:13:29,498
Oh, really?

412
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:30,775
- Yeah.
- We just pulled it out.

413
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:32,432
- The whole thing?
- No, no, it shot back in.

414
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:35,745
[Snooki]
There'’s still more in it.

415
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:37,195
Were we not supposed to
pull it out?

416
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:39,508
[JWOWW]
Vernix is what
the baby comes out in.

417
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:41,924
[JWOWW]
It'’s supposed to be, like,
the cream of all creams.

418
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:43,443
- It'’s that white, gooey stuff.
- That white stuff.

419
00:13:43,443 --> 00:13:45,583
[JWOWW]
It'’s like,
if they were to bottle it up,

420
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:49,104
it'’s, like,
$20,000 per, like, a small jar.

421
00:13:49,104 --> 00:13:51,623
Like, that'’s how good
it is for nutrients.

422
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,833
[Roger]
The old-school nurses say
it'’s, like, great for your skin.

423
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,524
[Roger]
Like, if you have an injury
or psoriasis or anything.

424
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:56,766
- Yeah.
- That guck?

425
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:57,940
You'’re lying.
You just want us

426
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,941
to put it on our face.

427
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:00,391
[laughter]

428
00:14:00,391 --> 00:14:02,600
Why didn'’t I take it off of her
and put it on my face?

429
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,291
- Oh, I did.
- I wish I knew that,

430
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,328
because when they put
Giovanna on me,

431
00:14:06,328 --> 00:14:07,363
I didn'’t want to touch her

432
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:09,814
because I thought
it was, like, gross.

433
00:14:09,814 --> 00:14:10,815
I still didn'’t poop.

434
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:11,989
[laughs]

435
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:13,576
I held off.
It wasn'’t that bad, though.

436
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:14,750
When'’d you poop after?

437
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,545
[JWOWW]
In the hospital.
They made me.

438
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,064
[Snooki]
I don'’t know why I'’m
not pooping, '’cause I'’m eating.

439
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:20,825
[JWOWW]
It'’s cause of the painkillers.

440
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,551
I'’m not sure
why it'’s important to poop

441
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:23,724
after you give birth,

442
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:25,830
but if I don'’t poop on my own,

443
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:28,281
I'’m gonna have to have
a nurse go up there and,

444
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:31,491
like, put her finger in there
and, like, move the poop around.

445
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:33,079
[makes fart noise]

446
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:35,460
[hiccups]
I'’ll try.

447
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,565
It'’s gonna be
like rabbit [bleep].

448
00:14:36,565 --> 00:14:38,463
[Snooki]
Stop.

449
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:41,190
- Little pebbles.
- No.

450
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,743
[Jionni]
I'’ll go poop first
and tell them it was you.

451
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:44,124
[laughter]
You'’re sick.

452
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,539
You'’re gonna
blow up the bathroom?

453
00:15:03,592 --> 00:15:05,490
I'’m gonna go play golf today.

454
00:15:10,564 --> 00:15:12,981
[gasps]
Lorenzo.

455
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:13,982
[Janis]
Hold your sign up.

456
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:16,708
[Snooki]
Welcome home, sissy.

457
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,366
[Janis]
Who'’s that?

458
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,265
[Snooki]
We'’re home as a family.

459
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:22,922
[Snooki]
I'’m with my two kids.

460
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,960
[Snooki]
We have Lorenzo and Giovanna and
now we can just live our lives.

461
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,411
I feel like this is
where I need to be.

462
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:32,724
[Jionni]
It'’s awesome coming home to,
you know, such a great family.

463
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,693
- Look at the baby.
- Lorenzo, who'’s this?

464
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:38,213
- Go ahead.
- Hi, baby.

465
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:39,524
Say hi, sissy.

466
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:41,423
[laughter]

467
00:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,977
That fact that I just
feel comfortable and relaxed,

468
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,531
this is what I needed
for the past couple days.

469
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:48,016
[Snooki]
I got to feed her.

470
00:15:48,016 --> 00:15:49,189
- Ready?
- We'’ll head out.

471
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:50,501
[Snooki]
Thanks guys for coming.

472
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:51,467
- Sure.
- Love you.

473
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:53,573
Let me kiss her.

474
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:54,574
- Love you.
- Love you.

475
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:55,644
- Bye, Ji.
- Bye.

476
00:15:55,644 --> 00:15:56,610
- Love you.
- I'’ll see you soon.

477
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,611
Thank you.

478
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:58,612
Nicole and I are very lucky.

479
00:15:58,612 --> 00:15:59,993
We--we have a great family.

480
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,616
We come from a great family,
and we'’re all really close,

481
00:16:02,616 --> 00:16:05,136
and, you know,
we can'’t ask for anything more.

482
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:06,551
Lorenzo.

483
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:09,106
- See you, boys.
- Want to watch King Kong?

484
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:11,867
See you, kids.

485
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:13,351
Good night, babe.

486
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:14,456
Good night.

487
00:16:14,456 --> 00:16:15,975
Okay.

488
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,805
First night home
with sissy.

489
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:21,704
Whoa.
I almost dropped my ice cream.

490
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:26,813
- Nicole?
- Yeah.

491
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,711
Joe'’s calling.

492
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:29,712
[Snooki]
All right, answer.

493
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:31,093
[Jionni]
Joe, what'’s up?

494
00:16:31,093 --> 00:16:32,750
[Joe]
What'’s going on?

495
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,820
[Jionni]
Nothing, just hanging.

496
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,270
[Jionni]
We'’re about to go to the house.

497
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,926
What are you doing?

498
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:38,480
[Joe]
I got some good news for you.

499
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,206
Uh-oh, let'’s hear it.

500
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:41,655
[Joe]
We got the temporary CO.

501
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:44,762
You can start moving stuff in,
and tomorrow is the big day.

502
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:45,763
[Joe]
You can sleep there.

503
00:16:45,763 --> 00:16:46,798
Whoa.

504
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,077
Yeah.

505
00:16:49,077 --> 00:16:50,768
- We can move into our house.
- All right.

506
00:16:50,768 --> 00:16:52,701
[Jionni]
And then tomorrow
we can sleep there?

507
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:54,668
[Joe]
You can sleep there.
Big day tomorrow.

508
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:56,049
- I appreciate it.
- No problem.

509
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,016
- See you there.
- All right, buddy, thanks.

510
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,019
[Jionni]
I'’ll see you.

511
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,399
Come on.

512
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,883
Last day in the basement.

513
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:04,471
[Jionni]
Last day in the basement.

514
00:17:04,471 --> 00:17:06,025
See you, Nonna.

515
00:17:09,407 --> 00:17:12,928
We just got news that we can
move into our house tomorrow,

516
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:14,481
so I was thinking
you and Roger--

517
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:15,896
[JWOWW]
You got your CO?

518
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:18,106
Well, we'’re gonna get
a temporary one for tomorrow.

519
00:17:18,106 --> 00:17:19,900
No, that'’s--
it'’s completely wrong.

520
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,281
Oh.
Oh.

521
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:23,111
We--we got our CO,
so we'’re gonna move in tomorrow.

522
00:17:23,111 --> 00:17:24,215
No, that'’s still wrong.

523
00:17:24,215 --> 00:17:25,216
What is it?

524
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:26,459
We have our temporary CO.

525
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:28,047
We can move our clothes.
Tomorrow is the official.

526
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,876
- I just said that.
- No, you didn'’t.

527
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:32,154
Kind of hard
to believe after 27 years,

528
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:33,983
this is the day
I actually move out,

529
00:17:33,983 --> 00:17:35,985
and I couldn'’t be any happier.

530
00:17:35,985 --> 00:17:38,160
[Snooki]
Yeah, we have two kids now, so

531
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,679
we'’re definitely
ready to move out

532
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,406
and start our life together.

533
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:44,891
[JWOWW]
That'’s awesome.
Congratulations.

534
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:48,032
[Jionni]
So Nicole wanted to know
if you guys want to come up,

535
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:49,930
have lunch, and maybe
help us move some stuff.

536
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,277
- Today?
- Yeah.

537
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:52,726
[JWOWW]
We'’d love to.

538
00:17:52,726 --> 00:17:55,246
I can'’t really do anything
because I just gave birth, so.

539
00:17:55,246 --> 00:17:56,868
- Oh, great.
- It'’s all you.

540
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,707
[Snooki]
It'’s so nice in here.

541
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:10,744
I forgot what it looks like.

542
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:12,298
Are you down to, like, moving
stuff upstairs...

543
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:15,197
- [shouting]
- Today, babe?

544
00:18:15,197 --> 00:18:17,268
Well, I want to do
some of my clothes first.

545
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:19,477
I feel like now
that we'’re finally in the house

546
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:21,030
and we'’re settled in,

547
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,964
now we'’re gonna have time
to actually work on our wedding

548
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:25,552
and make sure
everything gets done

549
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:27,658
because that'’s right around
the corner.

550
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:30,074
[Jionni]
The two biggest things
got checked off our list.

551
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:32,525
[Snooki]
Moving into the house,
and having a baby.

552
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:33,698
[Jionni]
Only one thing left to do.

553
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:37,185
Get married.

554
00:18:37,185 --> 00:18:39,428
Look what mama got.

555
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:45,020
No food on here, okay?

556
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,713
No food in this room.

557
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:49,887
All right,
put it down on the floor.

558
00:18:49,887 --> 00:18:51,233
- Put it right here.
- No!

559
00:18:51,233 --> 00:18:54,340
I don'’t want it
on my brand-new loveseat.

560
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,480
Loveseat?
What do you do, make love in it?

561
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,929
Yep.

562
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:00,000
We'’re gonna conceive
our third child on this baby.

563
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,761
Not with me.

564
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:03,901
- Okay.
- Go find him.

565
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:04,867
He'’s somewhere out there.

566
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,633
Hi.

567
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,221
- She'’s out.
- Oh, my God.

568
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:15,257
[JWOWW]
She'’s huge.

569
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:16,983
She eats every two hours.

570
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:18,571
She'’s getting enormous.

571
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,331
She looks like you as a baby.

572
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:21,781
Yeah, '’cause she'’s getting
fat, and I was a fat baby.

573
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:22,816
You were so fat.

574
00:19:22,816 --> 00:19:24,715
- I know.
- I can'’t even.

575
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:27,027
Chubby, chubby.

576
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:28,822
Mommy'’s chubby,
my daddy'’s chubby, we'’re chubby.

577
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:30,790
[laughs]
Stop.

578
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,791
[Snooki]
She'’s a monster.

579
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:32,930
Can we take a picture?

580
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,207
- Yeah, yeah.
- Get her away.

581
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:35,622
- My kid'’s gonna eat her.
- Is that normal?

582
00:19:35,622 --> 00:19:37,417
- That'’s like us.
- I know.

583
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:38,970
[JWOWW laughs]

584
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,972
[Roger]
My kid may eat your kid,
really.

585
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,526
She might just sneak
a hand over

586
00:19:42,526 --> 00:19:44,252
and palm her face and--aah.

587
00:19:44,252 --> 00:19:45,460
[Snooki]
That'’s literally us.

588
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,461
[JWOWW]
Can I please have
that picture?

589
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:48,704
- Yeah.
- I'’m dying.

590
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:51,673
- That'’s us, but babies.
- I know.

591
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:52,984
[JWOWW]
I'’m such a ham.

592
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,020
It'’s--it'’s literally scary.

593
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,711
- Like, they look like us.
- Yeah.

594
00:19:55,711 --> 00:19:56,919
[Snooki]
Like, you'’re the tall one,

595
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,094
and I'’m, like,
the little, short [bleep].

596
00:19:59,094 --> 00:20:00,060
- That'’s--
- Like, that'’s what

597
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,061
they look like right now.

598
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:02,235
- Yeah.
- And it'’s adorable.

599
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,409
It'’s so freaking cute.

600
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:04,410
I can'’t.

601
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,480
I could stare at this
all day.

602
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,550
Mm-hmm.

603
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:15,524
- Thank you for the tour.
- Thanks for coming.

604
00:20:15,524 --> 00:20:16,525
- The house is beautiful.
- Ooh, hold on.

605
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:17,526
I got to fix my hair.

606
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:20,391
I like you brunette better.

607
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:22,048
[Snooki]
I think you look beautiful
in any color.

608
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:25,465
If you were pink, purple, green,

609
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:29,642
but my JWOWW is a brunette.

610
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,368
Honestly, I'’ll have to admit

611
00:20:31,368 --> 00:20:32,990
that you might be right
on this one.

612
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,060
And you'’re over it already.

613
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,130
A little bit.

614
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:36,856
What do you think
of that blonde hair?

615
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:39,997
She literally spent

616
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:41,550
50 hours
turning her hair blonde.

617
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,034
- And she hates it.
- I knew--I knew she was gonna.

618
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,829
- Literally.
- I also broke out in hives.

619
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:47,349
[JWOWW]
Like, I had, like,
a reaction to it.

620
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:49,178
- Allergic to blonde.
- Are those Roger'’s shoes?

621
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:50,421
[Snooki]
'’Cause you'’re not supposed
to be a blonde.

622
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:52,181
My whole chest,
like, became red and inflamed.

623
00:20:52,181 --> 00:20:54,460
Yeah, God was telling you
this isn'’t right.

624
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,461
[laughs]

625
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:56,669
[JWOWW]
Blondes have more fun,

626
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:59,188
but I always say
brunettes get the job done.

627
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:01,052
[JWOWW]
So I need to be
a brunette again.

628
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,537
'’Cause I'’m not a [bleep] flake.

629
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:04,055
When are you getting
your hair did?

630
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,160
Tonight.

631
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,300
[Snooki]
I'’m getting my girl back.

632
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,991
[Snooki]
I'’ll see you soon, okay?

633
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,096
- Bye.
- Bye, guys. Bye, Meilani.

634
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:11,856
[Roger]
Beautiful house.

635
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:13,479
[Roger]
If you want to get your hair
done late, now, that'’s cool,

636
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:15,135
but we'’re not gonna be home
until late now.

637
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:17,966
It'’s only gonna take
an hour and a half, two hours.

638
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:20,555
[JWOWW]
Honestly,
I need to find my sexy back,

639
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:22,004
because right now
I just feel like

640
00:21:22,004 --> 00:21:24,455
a normal blonde from Michigan.

641
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:25,974
And I'’m not from Michigan.

642
00:21:25,974 --> 00:21:27,527
[JWOWW]
You two have fun.

643
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:29,288
[JWOWW]
Don'’t cause too much trouble.

644
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:39,988
[JWOWW]
I really just want
to go dark again,

645
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:41,161
but, like, no highlights.

646
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:42,784
- Just all dark.
- Okay.

647
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,061
[JWOWW]
And I actually want to do
what I'’ve been wanting

648
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:45,269
to do for years, now.

649
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:47,789
[woman]
What?

650
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:49,100
- Do your shave?
- Yeah.

651
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,758
For, I would say
almost three years,

652
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:53,657
I'’ve always wanted
to take the left side

653
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:55,383
and shave half my head.

654
00:21:55,383 --> 00:21:58,455
So you'’re going from mommy
to punk rocker?

655
00:21:58,455 --> 00:21:59,801
I definitely want to be
a MILF,

656
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:02,838
so I'’m gonna
take it to a whole new extreme.

657
00:22:02,838 --> 00:22:03,977
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

658
00:22:03,977 --> 00:22:06,186
It'’s gonna grow back,
if anything.

659
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:07,774
- In 20 years?
- 20 years?

660
00:22:07,774 --> 00:22:09,707
Like, five.

661
00:22:09,707 --> 00:22:10,674
I'’m kidding.
- Oh, my gosh. Really?

662
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:12,779
Are you?

663
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:13,780
Oh, my god, stop.

664
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,816
I'’m kidding.

665
00:22:14,816 --> 00:22:15,782
[woman]
Don'’t stop.

666
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:16,818
[laughter]

667
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:18,302
[woman]
Oh, my god.

668
00:22:18,302 --> 00:22:19,372
Just do it.

669
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:20,994
Do--close your eyes, everybody.

670
00:22:20,994 --> 00:22:22,858
[JWOWW]
I'’m [bleep] myself
because I'’m like,

671
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:24,239
you can'’t go back
from that [bleep].

672
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,827
[JWOWW]
You can'’t go back
from that [bleep].

673
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:26,931
[JWOWW]
I'’m done. You can'’t go back
from this [bleep].

674
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:28,139
I'’m definitely nervous
right now.

675
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,107
Now I need a drink.

676
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:31,695
That feels good, actually.

677
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:36,838
[woman]
Aww, you'’re not blonde anymore.

678
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:37,942
Yay.

679
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:39,323
If you shaved your whole head,

680
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:40,669
I feel like
you would look pretty.

681
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:43,051
- I love it. I [bleep] love it.
- Calm down. Calm down.

682
00:22:43,051 --> 00:22:44,880
It definitely
is better than the blonde,

683
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,468
and it fits my personality,

684
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:48,677
but I'’m definitely concerned
if Roger'’s gonna attack me

685
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:50,886
when he sees me
with my new hair.

686
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,232
Now it'’s like you'’re home.

687
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:53,233
I am. I'’m home.

688
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,788
Aww.

689
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:56,754
[woman]
Bye, sweet cheeks.

690
00:22:58,894 --> 00:23:00,275
[JWOWW]
Babe?

691
00:23:00,275 --> 00:23:01,449
[Roger]
Hi.

692
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:03,002
Hey.

693
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:05,004
How was your day?

694
00:23:05,004 --> 00:23:08,076
[sighs]

695
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:09,111
[JWOWW]
What do you think?

696
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:10,596
I really like it, actually.

697
00:23:10,596 --> 00:23:11,666
- Really?
- Yeah.

698
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:12,908
I think it looks amazing.

699
00:23:12,908 --> 00:23:14,669
Like Christy Mack, actually.

700
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:16,602
Oh, your favorite porn star.

701
00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:17,637
- That'’s great.
- [laughs]

702
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:19,156
Well, don'’t expect me
to act like her.

703
00:23:19,156 --> 00:23:23,194
Jenni definitely has a certain
porn star quality to her now,

704
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:24,713
for sure.

705
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:26,025
Not that it'’s gonna probably
change anything in our bedroom.

706
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:27,440
- No.
- But...

707
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,855
Did you see
how quick she says no?

708
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:30,650
Before I can even say it.
"No."

709
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,858
Hi.

710
00:23:31,858 --> 00:23:33,204
I really like it.
It looks really good.

711
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,690
Do you recognize your mommy?

712
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,002
[JWOWW]
I don'’t think Meilani
recognizes me right now.

713
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,487
She'’s looking a little upset.

714
00:23:39,487 --> 00:23:40,936
- [baby crying]
- Oh.

715
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:42,421
Does she scare you?

716
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,456
Does she scare you?

717
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,009
Who'’s that strange lady?

718
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:47,115
"Daddy, why is there a porn star
in my house?

719
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:48,461
Daddy, daddy."

720
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,221
Stop.
Don'’t make--I'’m gonna cry.

721
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:53,155
Shut up.
You'’re disgusting.

722
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:56,193
Let'’s go to bed
with your new porn star mother.

723
00:23:56,193 --> 00:23:57,505
Did you shave downstairs too?

724
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:58,644
[JWOWW]
Shut up.

725
00:23:58,644 --> 00:24:00,128
[Roger laughs]

726
00:24:05,582 --> 00:24:06,721
[Jionni]
Lorenzo?

727
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:08,274
You ready to start
moving into our house?

728
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:09,827
Yeah.

729
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:12,451
[Snooki]
This morning is the last
morning at Janis'’s house.

730
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,797
Like, this is for real.

731
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:15,005
[Snooki]
Today'’s the day.

732
00:24:15,005 --> 00:24:16,489
Let'’s get the hell out of here.

733
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:19,043
[Jionni]
Oh, my God.
We'’ve got all these boxes too.

734
00:24:19,043 --> 00:24:20,286
Ugh!

735
00:24:23,289 --> 00:24:24,428
[grunts]

736
00:24:24,428 --> 00:24:26,568
Oh, I can lift again.

737
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:27,983
Bye, basement.

738
00:24:37,545 --> 00:24:38,546
[grunts]

739
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:39,892
Mama.

740
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:42,722
Mommy'’s nipples are burning.

741
00:24:42,722 --> 00:24:45,414
I'’ve never owned
my own place before.

742
00:24:45,414 --> 00:24:48,210
[Snooki]
I moved from my mom'’s house
to the Shore,

743
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,798
back to my mom'’s house,

744
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:52,145
to Jionni'’s basement,
and now here.

745
00:24:52,145 --> 00:24:53,837
So, this is definitely,

746
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:58,151
like, a huge, adult,
parent moment for me.

747
00:24:58,151 --> 00:24:59,152
Mom.

748
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:00,326
[doorbell rings]

749
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:01,396
Are you kidding?

750
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:03,122
You guys locked the door?

751
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:04,675
Who'’s that?

752
00:25:04,675 --> 00:25:06,021
Carly.

753
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:07,264
No, Carly'’s not here.

754
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:08,576
Babe?

755
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:15,203
They locked the door
already on me.

756
00:25:15,203 --> 00:25:16,204
Stay here.

757
00:25:16,204 --> 00:25:17,619
I'’m scared.

758
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:19,172
[Snooki whimpers]

759
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:20,208
Are they kidding?

760
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,727
You guys locked the door?

761
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:22,728
Oh.

762
00:25:22,728 --> 00:25:24,108
[sighs]

763
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:25,075
[Jionni]
It'’s the first day
in our new house.

764
00:25:25,075 --> 00:25:26,663
My mom'’s here already.

765
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:28,872
It'’s only been a few hours,
and she'’s already crashing it.

766
00:25:28,872 --> 00:25:30,045
I was scared.

767
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:31,495
I just thought you were
a Terminator or something.

768
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:34,291
Oh, my god.
I'’m here to help.

769
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,292
Thank you.

770
00:25:35,292 --> 00:25:36,293
[Janis]
You'’re welcome.

771
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:37,708
Hi, Nonna.

772
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:40,055
So Janis comes over,
and I'’m just relieved

773
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:42,851
because I know she'’s gonna
help me put everything away.

774
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:44,266
[Janis]
But don'’t do too much.

775
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:45,440
[Snooki]
But I had no idea

776
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,649
she was gonna be
Speedy Gonzales with everything.

777
00:25:51,204 --> 00:25:52,240
Where do you want me to
put everything?

778
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,413
Oh, there you are.

779
00:25:53,413 --> 00:25:54,967
Do you want me to bring
these boxes outside?

780
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,659
Yeah.
Thank you.

781
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,248
[indistinct chatter on TV]
Big game tonight.

782
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:01,732
Your Nonna'’s a madwoman.

783
00:26:01,732 --> 00:26:04,114
Okay, here we go.

784
00:26:04,114 --> 00:26:07,600
Do we have cleanser?

785
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,706
This stuff'’s good.

786
00:26:09,706 --> 00:26:10,845
Let'’s start doing the pantry.

787
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:12,329
Just put it anywhere?

788
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:14,227
This doesn'’t go here.

789
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:16,160
[Janis]
Whoa, look at this
we'’ve got to fix.

790
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,886
Whoa.

791
00:26:17,886 --> 00:26:19,854
More pillowcases.

792
00:26:19,854 --> 00:26:21,718
What do you want me to do?

793
00:26:21,718 --> 00:26:23,443
Mop the floor.

794
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:24,859
I'’m not mopping the floor.

795
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:31,866
[Jionni]
Having my mom
at the house is awesome.

796
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,730
[Snooki]
She'’s literally
running back and forth,

797
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:35,697
putting things away.

798
00:26:35,697 --> 00:26:37,112
- She was a monster.
- It'’s how she--

799
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,113
that'’s just what--
that'’s just what she does.

800
00:26:38,113 --> 00:26:39,494
Yeah, but she was, like,
on crack.

801
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:41,116
Like zing, zing, zing.

802
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:42,808
My mom doesn'’t do crack.

803
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:43,809
I'’m not saying she does.

804
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:45,569
It'’s a expression, Jionni.

805
00:26:45,569 --> 00:26:46,881
Oh, my God.

806
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:47,882
[Janis]
What?

807
00:26:47,882 --> 00:26:49,746
Her bacon strip fell off.

808
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:50,747
Her what?

809
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:52,680
Her bacon strip.

810
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,750
Ew.

811
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,406
Isn'’t it called
a belly button?

812
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:56,891
All right.

813
00:26:56,891 --> 00:26:58,237
Jionni!

814
00:26:58,237 --> 00:26:59,445
What?

815
00:26:59,445 --> 00:27:01,689
Her bacon strip fell off!

816
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:02,759
Already?

817
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,105
Your mama'’s cuckoo.

818
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:05,002
- I hate to tell you.
- Oh.

819
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:08,523
[Snooki]
I want to save it
with Lorenzo'’s.

820
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:10,490
Good job, baby.

821
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,871
[Snooki]
Can you just look at it?

822
00:27:11,871 --> 00:27:13,459
[Snooki]
This just makes me
really nervous

823
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:15,495
because her bacon strip
already fell off,

824
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:17,739
and now I'’m thinking, you know,

825
00:27:17,739 --> 00:27:19,154
when she'’s gonna
go on her first date

826
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:21,087
and when she goes to prom,
when she gets married--

827
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:22,502
We'’re not there yet.

828
00:27:22,502 --> 00:27:24,988
I'’m just--she'’s growing up
too quick on--on me.

829
00:27:24,988 --> 00:27:26,610
- I can'’t.
- She'’s not going to prom.

830
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:28,681
Bugs on your food.

831
00:27:33,928 --> 00:27:35,550
You'’re gonna make him
knock over the drink.

832
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,793
Oh, sorry.

833
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,452
You just jinxed me.

834
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,109
[Jionni]
Well, time to go, Ma.

835
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:45,318
It was a really long day
for Nicole and I

836
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:47,286
with all the moving
and the unpacking.

837
00:27:47,286 --> 00:27:48,736
We want to enjoy
our new house tonight.

838
00:27:48,736 --> 00:27:50,151
I feel bad I didn'’t finish.

839
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:51,600
You did so much, though.

840
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,464
Mom, thank you so much.

841
00:27:53,464 --> 00:27:54,500
Make sure you
lock the front door!

842
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,639
[Jionni]
Okay.

843
00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:57,054
Come back tomorrow.

844
00:28:03,889 --> 00:28:05,062
[JWOWW]
We'’re here.

845
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:08,790
- Morning, Squirrel.
- Good morning.

846
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,689
Lorenzo, say, "Hi, Aunt Jenni."

847
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,931
Hi.

848
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:13,484
Say, "Hi, Meilani."

849
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,554
Oh, she'’s sleeping.

850
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:16,280
Did you get good sleep?

851
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,697
No.
So it'’s trying time.

852
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,767
Meh. But, I mean,

853
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:21,389
he takes on both kids
when I need him,

854
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:24,150
like if I have to go shower
or I want to take a quick nap,

855
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,807
he'’s--I'’m like,
"Can you watch both kids?"

856
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:27,567
He'’s like,
"Yeah, no problem," so...

857
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:28,845
- He'’s, like, the best dad ever.
- Yeah, this morning Roger was,

858
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:30,950
like, bouncing her around
when I'’m like...

859
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,020
[snores]

860
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,021
[JWOWW]
So...

861
00:28:33,021 --> 00:28:34,022
We have good guys.

862
00:28:34,022 --> 00:28:35,023
Yeah, no doubt.

863
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:36,128
They definitely deserve
something.

864
00:28:36,128 --> 00:28:37,819
[huffing]

865
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,201
No, they are really
good dads.

866
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,927
Even though we'’re
awesome moms.

867
00:28:41,927 --> 00:28:42,962
We'’re fabulous moms.

868
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:43,998
Yeah.

869
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:45,275
I honestly think
we'’re really blessed

870
00:28:45,275 --> 00:28:47,035
to have Jionni and Roger
in our lives.

871
00:28:47,035 --> 00:28:49,589
[JWOWW]
They'’re so awesome,
just as dads alone.

872
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:51,281
As fiances, I mean, yeah,

873
00:28:51,281 --> 00:28:52,903
I seriously want to kick
his ass all the time,

874
00:28:52,903 --> 00:28:54,905
but he'’s--they'’re great.

875
00:28:54,905 --> 00:28:57,218
[Snooki]
Well, maybe we could do
something for them,

876
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:59,358
like, it'’s Dad Appreciation Day.

877
00:28:59,358 --> 00:29:00,704
"Thank you, dads."

878
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:02,085
What are we gonna do
for them?

879
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:06,054
The obvious thing is probably
cook something for them.

880
00:29:06,054 --> 00:29:07,538
I was gonna say
send them away.

881
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:10,196
[laughing]

882
00:29:10,196 --> 00:29:12,681
I could get Carly to come
over here and watch the kids,

883
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:14,338
and then the boys,

884
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:16,720
obviously we don'’t want
them here when we'’re cooking.

885
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,584
We should get them a limo.

886
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:19,999
I like that.
And that gives us enough time

887
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:21,104
to, like, prep the dinner.

888
00:29:21,104 --> 00:29:22,484
[Snooki]
Mm-hmm.

889
00:29:22,484 --> 00:29:25,280
- That'’s hopefully edible.
- I always cook Italian.

890
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,696
No Italian. Chinese.

891
00:29:27,696 --> 00:29:28,939
- Roger doesn'’t like Chinese.
- Okay.

892
00:29:28,939 --> 00:29:31,459
He likes Japanese.
He likes, like, sushi.

893
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:32,771
- You want to try sushi?
- Yeah, you can put, like,

894
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,393
a Dorito in a sushi roll
if you wanted to.

895
00:29:34,393 --> 00:29:36,222
Mmm.
Then we can also, like,

896
00:29:36,222 --> 00:29:38,086
give them massages.

897
00:29:38,086 --> 00:29:39,501
Aww.

898
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:41,227
- My hands cramp up.
- I feel like Roger would

899
00:29:41,227 --> 00:29:43,022
be like, "Lower, lower."

900
00:29:43,022 --> 00:29:44,472
[laughs]

901
00:29:44,472 --> 00:29:47,613
I definitely want the boys
to have fun, so get them a limo.

902
00:29:47,613 --> 00:29:48,821
- Yeah.
- And get the massage stuff

903
00:29:48,821 --> 00:29:50,374
ready so when they get
back to the house,

904
00:29:50,374 --> 00:29:52,031
we can all have a nice dinner,

905
00:29:52,031 --> 00:29:53,722
And we can give them massages
and happy endings.

906
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:56,035
Rubs the lotion--what?

907
00:29:56,035 --> 00:29:57,140
I'’m kidding.

908
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,106
We'’re moms.
We don'’t do that.

909
00:29:58,106 --> 00:29:59,142
No.

910
00:29:59,142 --> 00:30:02,076
How to make sushi.

911
00:30:02,076 --> 00:30:03,767
Hi.

912
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:04,768
[Snooki]
It can'’t be that hard.

913
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:06,356
It looks really easy,
actually.

914
00:30:06,356 --> 00:30:08,772
I'’ll make a grocery list.

915
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:10,532
I think the guys
are gonna be dumbfounded.

916
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:12,293
They'’re gonna be like,
"What did you do?"

917
00:30:12,293 --> 00:30:13,259
Or they'’re gonna be like--yeah,
"Who'’d you hook up with? "

918
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:14,571
Yeah.

919
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:15,537
They'’re gonna think
we did something wrong.

920
00:30:15,537 --> 00:30:16,676
Yeah.

921
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:17,643
[doorbell rings]

922
00:30:17,643 --> 00:30:19,127
[Snooki gasps]

923
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:20,991
- Carly'’s here.
- Carly'’s here.

924
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:22,027
Carly'’s here.

925
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:24,167
- Hi, Carly.
- Hi.

926
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:25,651
What are you doing?

927
00:30:25,651 --> 00:30:27,135
Say hi.

928
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:28,585
Me and Jenni are doing
a lot today

929
00:30:28,585 --> 00:30:29,689
because we'’ve got to
go to the store

930
00:30:29,689 --> 00:30:31,899
and get our sushi stuff,
get massage stuff,

931
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:34,280
and then set everything up
at the house.

932
00:30:42,771 --> 00:30:43,772
I'’ll get a cart.

933
00:30:43,772 --> 00:30:45,050
Okay.

934
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,948
I personally have never been
to an Asian market before.

935
00:30:46,948 --> 00:30:48,605
Me neither.

936
00:30:48,605 --> 00:30:52,333
I honestly feel like we'’re
transporting into, like, Japan.

937
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,955
I don'’t know what this says.

938
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:56,095
And everything is in Asian.

939
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:57,269
I don'’t understand anything.

940
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:59,167
Yan-Yan.

941
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:00,168
Yan-Yan.

942
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:01,583
What the [bleep] is this?

943
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:02,964
What the [bleep]
are these?

944
00:31:02,964 --> 00:31:03,965
That looks like fingers.

945
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:05,415
That looks like
[bleep] fingers.

946
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:06,795
- Clams.
- That looks like cow tongue.

947
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:08,176
Ew, this looks like dried bugs.

948
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:09,212
Oh.

949
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:10,938
What the hell is this?

950
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:13,319
That'’s a Big--
it'’s called a Big Squish.

951
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:14,527
How much to eat this?

952
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:16,288
No.
Couldn'’t pay me.

953
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:17,634
We don'’t necessarily have to
read the labels.

954
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:21,155
We just have to, like, scan
the aisles for the actual item.

955
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:22,881
Rice?

956
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,192
Oh, that'’s breadcrumbs.

957
00:31:24,192 --> 00:31:26,022
Oh.

958
00:31:26,022 --> 00:31:27,851
I feel like this is
the sushi aisle.

959
00:31:27,851 --> 00:31:29,439
Oh, here we go.

960
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:30,923
Oh.
A bunch of seaweed.

961
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,373
Seaweed rolls.

962
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,133
Looks like tissue paper.

963
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:35,169
I don'’t know
how the [bleep] to make sushi.

964
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:36,756
I know it'’s, like, sticky rice.

965
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:37,999
Oh, my god, miso soup.

966
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,484
Miso horny.

967
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:41,658
It'’s sticky rice...

968
00:31:41,658 --> 00:31:43,004
both: Seaweed.

969
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:44,523
And then you just roll it
with whatever you want.

970
00:31:44,523 --> 00:31:47,664
Whatever you want.
Let your imagination create.

971
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:48,941
- How are you?
- Oh, you'’re the fish expert.

972
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,563
We'’re trying to make sushi.

973
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:51,737
What do you like?

974
00:31:51,737 --> 00:31:53,014
Salmon.

975
00:31:53,014 --> 00:31:56,466
We have salmon,
tuna, or shellfish.

976
00:31:56,466 --> 00:31:57,501
Is this fish eggs?

977
00:31:57,501 --> 00:31:58,468
Fish eggs.
Salmon.

978
00:31:58,468 --> 00:31:59,883
Hoo.

979
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:00,919
- What'’s a fish egg?
- Oh, my God.

980
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,472
They'’re little babies.

981
00:32:02,472 --> 00:32:03,507
We all know I don'’t like fish.

982
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:04,853
I just don'’t like
the smell of it.

983
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:06,683
[Snooki]
I think it'’s gross.
I think of Nemo.

984
00:32:06,683 --> 00:32:08,512
Like, I think of all
these cute little characters,

985
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:10,169
and now they'’re all dead.

986
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:11,791
Did you ever see Finding Nemo?

987
00:32:11,791 --> 00:32:12,931
[laughs]

988
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,175
Stop.

989
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:17,452
Stop.

990
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:18,591
Oh, my God!

991
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:20,455
Oh, stop. Jenni.

992
00:32:20,455 --> 00:32:22,181
[JWOWW]
I'’ll buy this one too.

993
00:32:22,181 --> 00:32:24,183
Oh, my God.

994
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:25,184
What are they?

995
00:32:25,184 --> 00:32:26,634
Sea bass or carp.

996
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:27,635
Sea bass?

997
00:32:27,635 --> 00:32:28,636
Bass or a carp.

998
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:30,051
- 12 carp?
- Yes.

999
00:32:30,051 --> 00:32:31,225
Whoa.

1000
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:32,260
Aah!

1001
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,744
That was--I thought
it was my earring!

1002
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,436
[laughs]

1003
00:32:35,436 --> 00:32:36,885
I mean, if you'’re gonna
throw a shrimp at me,

1004
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:38,370
I'’m gonna put it on you.

1005
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,578
Don'’t [bleep] with me.

1006
00:32:39,578 --> 00:32:40,579
[laughs]

1007
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:43,099
Oh, my God.

1008
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,755
[Snooki]
Is this a slaughterhouse?

1009
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:47,896
[JWOWW]
When it comes to thousands
of little fishies underneath,

1010
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:49,070
and it'’s like your own--

1011
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,590
you get to pick
and slaughter them, and--

1012
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,626
[Snooki]
They'’re staring at you saying,
"Help me."

1013
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:55,145
- That'’s terrible.
- Yeah.

1014
00:32:55,145 --> 00:32:56,560
Who'’s down there?
Who'’s down there?

1015
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,561
No.

1016
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:58,597
[screaming]

1017
00:32:58,597 --> 00:33:00,254
[JWOWW]
Nope, I'’m good.

1018
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:01,496
Let it free.

1019
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:03,395
[Snooki]
Oh, my God.
I can'’t.

1020
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:05,017
I'’m gonna have
nightmares of this place.

1021
00:33:08,952 --> 00:33:11,575
- Maybe.
- Now we have to go to Buddy'’s.

1022
00:33:11,575 --> 00:33:13,301
Help wanted, sales associate.

1023
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:15,234
That'’s my next job.

1024
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:16,925
And Buddy'’s is where we'’re gonna
get all of the stuff

1025
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:20,929
that we need
for our massage experience.

1026
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:22,862
- Yeah.
- Oils to lube up their backs.

1027
00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:26,314
Ooh, these are rub-a-dubs.

1028
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:27,557
Personal massager.

1029
00:33:27,557 --> 00:33:29,248
How many of these?
Do we need a bunch of these?

1030
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:30,491
Yes.

1031
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:34,874
What about vibrators?

1032
00:33:34,874 --> 00:33:36,497
But usually
when you get a massage,

1033
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:39,051
sometimes
they use a back massager.

1034
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:42,020
- Like a vibrator.
- Which we call a vibrator.

1035
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,022
Over two-hour run time.

1036
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,195
Oh, that'’s a good run time.

1037
00:33:45,195 --> 00:33:47,577
[Snooki]
Oh, my God.
That'’s crazy.

1038
00:33:47,577 --> 00:33:50,476
[JWOWW]
We'’ll buy a couple vibrators.

1039
00:33:53,548 --> 00:33:55,171
I think we'’ll get one of those.

1040
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:56,620
I think we'’ll get two.

1041
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,932
[JWOWW]
I'’m bringing this vibrator home
with me, yes.

1042
00:33:57,932 --> 00:34:00,038
I'’m glad that we
bought three different types.

1043
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,247
Mm-hmm.
I'’m gonna use it on my back.

1044
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:04,352
Mm.

1045
00:34:04,352 --> 00:34:06,630
My nipples are leaking.

1046
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,149
We like your massagers.

1047
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:09,806
[cashier]
Oh, I'’m glad to see it.

1048
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:12,843
And of course we have
the Shiney Hiney back here.

1049
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,190
[JWOWW]
What'’s a Shiney Hiney?

1050
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,846
- Oh, my God.
- Bring sexy back in the back.

1051
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:16,847
A butt cleaner.

1052
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:17,848
Mm-hmm.

1053
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:19,264
A nice butt cleaner.

1054
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,438
I don'’t even know--like,
a toothbrush for the butt.

1055
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:23,889
- Never even knew that existed.
- Nope.

1056
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:26,167
[cashier]
But it is going to actually
have a whitening cream

1057
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:29,826
as well as three flavors
of cleansing creams.

1058
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:31,138
And you [bleep] up your butt?

1059
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:33,036
And you just--yup,
right there.

1060
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:35,418
So, like, after, like,
a crazy poop or a crazy workout.

1061
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:36,626
- You can clean your butt.
- You go in the shower,

1062
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:39,594
and you just, like,
toothbrush your butthole.

1063
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:41,803
Yeah.
You just kind of--your butthole.

1064
00:34:41,803 --> 00:34:43,391
So it'’s nice and clean.

1065
00:34:43,391 --> 00:34:44,599
- Bye.
- Thanks for my Shiney Hiney.

1066
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,325
- Thanks for the ass cleaner.
- Use it well.

1067
00:34:49,915 --> 00:34:51,641
[Snooki]
This episode of
Snooki &amp;JWOWW...

1068
00:34:51,641 --> 00:34:52,952
[JWOWW]
Continues now.

1069
00:34:58,234 --> 00:34:59,235
[doors close]
[JWOWW]
Yummy.

1070
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:00,374
Ooh.

1071
00:35:00,374 --> 00:35:02,721
You got that rice?

1072
00:35:02,721 --> 00:35:05,344
I hope this turns out
to be edible.

1073
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,726
[Snooki]
Me and Jenni don'’t know when
the boys are gonna get back,

1074
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:08,692
so we want to get
everything done

1075
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,211
before they get to the house.

1076
00:35:10,211 --> 00:35:12,558
We'’re literally just
rushing to get everything done

1077
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:15,285
so when the boys get here,
they'’re gonna be surprised.

1078
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,122
Press like this.

1079
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,675
[Snooki]
Oh, it definitely
feels like sushi.

1080
00:35:29,368 --> 00:35:30,921
We know how to make sushi now.

1081
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,716
Hey.

1082
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,166
[Snooki]
I think the boys
are gonna be surprised.

1083
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,824
I mean, they have no idea
what we'’re doing.

1084
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:39,482
I hope I spelled
"appreciation" right.

1085
00:35:39,482 --> 00:35:41,449
Yeah, that looks right.

1086
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:43,244
But they know
we'’re doing something.

1087
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:46,523
I think we did
a pretty frigging amazing job.

1088
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:48,456
I don'’t know whether to be
nervous or excited,

1089
00:35:48,456 --> 00:35:49,975
because this is rare,

1090
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:52,943
for the girls to send a limo
to pick us up from work, right?

1091
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:53,944
It is pretty random.

1092
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,188
Something--something'’s up.

1093
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:57,293
What do you think?

1094
00:35:57,293 --> 00:35:58,673
Maybe they'’re guilty
about something?

1095
00:35:58,673 --> 00:36:00,227
Maybe they did something?

1096
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:01,297
Maybe they'’re trying
to make it up

1097
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:03,057
before we find out
what it is?

1098
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:05,163
[Jionni]
I can'’t figure out
why the girls did this for us.

1099
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,785
Usually when the girls
do something nice for us,

1100
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:08,856
there'’s--there'’s a reason.
There'’s something behind it.

1101
00:36:08,856 --> 00:36:10,616
Where you taking us?

1102
00:36:10,616 --> 00:36:11,962
Nervous.

1103
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,309
"This is not your child,
but here'’s a limo."

1104
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:16,381
[laughter]

1105
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:18,624
Is it possible
we'’re going to your house?

1106
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:20,178
- I don'’t know.
- They can'’t cook.

1107
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:24,009
If they are cooking, should we
call for pizza just in case?

1108
00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:25,424
Absolutely.

1109
00:36:26,943 --> 00:36:28,358
I think we'’re ready.

1110
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:29,670
Everything looks phenomenal.

1111
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,878
[Snooki]
I mean, the massage stuff
looks great.

1112
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:32,017
[Snooki]
The table is set.

1113
00:36:32,017 --> 00:36:33,812
[Snooki]
So hopefully,

1114
00:36:33,812 --> 00:36:34,813
they'’re gonna be surprised.

1115
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:37,609
Jenni, I think
the boys are here.

1116
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,024
Yeah, they'’re here.

1117
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:40,025
[JWOWW]
Are they?

1118
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:41,337
Oh, my God.

1119
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:43,442
Hide.

1120
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:44,685
[JWOWW]
I'’m just really happy
that we'’re able

1121
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:45,927
to do this for the boys

1122
00:36:45,927 --> 00:36:48,033
because I can'’t remember
the last time

1123
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:49,517
I did something nice for Roger.

1124
00:36:49,517 --> 00:36:50,518
- Seriously.
- And especially, like,

1125
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:51,830
him being a new dad,

1126
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,523
he needs to know that
I appreciate everything he does.

1127
00:36:55,523 --> 00:36:56,490
Agreed.

1128
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,149
- Oh, it'’s not--
- Locked out of my own house.

1129
00:37:01,149 --> 00:37:02,150
[doorbell rings]
[Snooki]
Damn it.

1130
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,738
Damn it.

1131
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:07,086
Got to open the door.
[bleep].

1132
00:37:07,086 --> 00:37:08,156
Say surprise when I open it.

1133
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:10,952
[JWOWW] Okay.
both: One, two, three.

1134
00:37:10,952 --> 00:37:12,782
- [yawns]
both: Surprise!

1135
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:13,783
Hi.

1136
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:14,818
- Hi.
- Hello.

1137
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:15,785
[Roger]
Surprise?

1138
00:37:15,785 --> 00:37:17,407
Happy Daddy Day.

1139
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:18,753
[Roger]
As soon as
we walked through the door,

1140
00:37:18,753 --> 00:37:21,963
it was Dad Appreciation Day,
which I never expected.

1141
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:23,310
We have more for you.

1142
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,311
- Yeah.
- More?

1143
00:37:24,311 --> 00:37:25,312
- Let'’s go.
- Come on.

1144
00:37:25,312 --> 00:37:26,520
We have more surprises.

1145
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,349
[Snooki]
Welcome to the massage parlor.

1146
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:30,282
- No way.
- Oh.

1147
00:37:30,282 --> 00:37:34,355
[Roger]
So the girls have this entire
kind of, like, spa setup there.

1148
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:36,150
- Put your robes on.
- Yes.

1149
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,532
Vibrators and some
odd-looking stuff,

1150
00:37:38,532 --> 00:37:40,154
but hey, whatever, I'’m game.

1151
00:37:40,154 --> 00:37:41,120
- I don'’t want the--
- If it only happens once,

1152
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,812
it'’s not gay.

1153
00:37:42,812 --> 00:37:44,848
[Snooki]
I don'’t really have
a plan here.

1154
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:45,953
- Um...
- Let'’s just start off

1155
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:46,954
with these?

1156
00:37:46,954 --> 00:37:48,473
Just to get it nice and--

1157
00:37:48,473 --> 00:37:49,646
How do you give a massage?

1158
00:37:49,646 --> 00:37:50,785
Can you just lay down?

1159
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:52,200
- Okay, ready?
- [sighs]

1160
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,065
[Snooki]
I'’m not really sure
what you do with these.

1161
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:56,584
But I feel like this is it.

1162
00:37:56,584 --> 00:37:57,827
Does that feel nice, sir?

1163
00:37:57,827 --> 00:37:59,035
Yeah, keep going.

1164
00:37:59,035 --> 00:38:00,519
The girls had a massage set up.

1165
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:02,280
They--we--we put our robes on.

1166
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,764
Oh, yeah, baby.

1167
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:07,181
That'’s what I'’m talking about.

1168
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:08,458
What are you doing?

1169
00:38:08,458 --> 00:38:10,288
I have, like,
a vibrator thing for your back.

1170
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,358
Oh.

1171
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:12,704
Can you work that
on the front side

1172
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:13,981
a little bit there, mama?

1173
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:15,741
Stop.

1174
00:38:15,741 --> 00:38:17,053
What'’s wrong with you?

1175
00:38:17,053 --> 00:38:19,297
I'’m massaging your butt.

1176
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,781
Why would you stick that
in my butthole?

1177
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:22,092
I didn'’t put it
in your butthole.

1178
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,231
[laughs]

1179
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:24,578
That'’s stupid.

1180
00:38:24,578 --> 00:38:26,511
[Jionni]
I thought this was
Dad Appreciation Day,

1181
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:30,169
and I don'’t appreciate being
violated right now, so let'’s--

1182
00:38:30,169 --> 00:38:31,170
let'’s move on.

1183
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,310
You guys hungry?

1184
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,966
- You guys hungry?
- Mmm.

1185
00:38:33,966 --> 00:38:36,452
- We did this all by ourselves.
- Yeah.

1186
00:38:36,452 --> 00:38:38,454
I'’m definitely a little
suspicious of Jenni and Nicole.

1187
00:38:38,454 --> 00:38:39,558
I'’m scared.

1188
00:38:39,558 --> 00:38:41,042
You guys are scaring us.

1189
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:42,492
[Roger]
I don'’t know.

1190
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:44,425
I don'’t--if Meilani comes
walking around the corner

1191
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:46,669
with a cast on her leg,
I'’m gonna be really pissed.

1192
00:38:46,669 --> 00:38:49,119
- Ta-da.
- Surprise.

1193
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,880
- We made you sushi.
- We made sushi.

1194
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,122
- Babe, this is yours.
- Oh, my God.

1195
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,400
You did make us sushi.
- We really made this.

1196
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,781
They made us sushi rolls.

1197
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:57,024
[Roger]
I'’m a little nervous

1198
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,922
because sushi, you know,
that'’s a delicate craft.

1199
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,027
You'’ve really got to know
what you'’re doing.

1200
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:01,477
But they look amazing.

1201
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:03,444
I'’m hoping that they taste
as good as they look.

1202
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:06,240
How often do these
Dad Appreciation Days happen?

1203
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,587
[Snooki]
Once in a blue moon.

1204
00:39:08,587 --> 00:39:09,726
Wow.

1205
00:39:09,726 --> 00:39:11,038
This is good sushi.

1206
00:39:11,038 --> 00:39:12,453
I put them up there
with any good sushi restaurant

1207
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:13,454
I'’ve been to.

1208
00:39:13,454 --> 00:39:14,455
High five.

1209
00:39:14,455 --> 00:39:16,768
Thank you.

1210
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:17,769
We also made you cards.

1211
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:19,460
[Jionni]
Thank you.

1212
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,841
Here'’s your card...

1213
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:21,842
[muffled]

1214
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:23,153
And your card.

1215
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,293
[Roger]
Mine says, "To daddy,"

1216
00:39:25,293 --> 00:39:27,330
and it'’s got
some stickers on it.

1217
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,331
[laughs]

1218
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:30,126
[Roger]
"Thank you so much for being

1219
00:39:30,126 --> 00:39:32,059
"the best dad
anyone could have asked for,

1220
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:33,371
Meilani and Jenni."

1221
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,372
Aww.

1222
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,373
[Roger]
Aww.

1223
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,443
[Jionni]
"Jionni...

1224
00:39:36,443 --> 00:39:37,858
"We love you.

1225
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:41,517
"Thank you for being
the best dad and fiance ever.

1226
00:39:41,517 --> 00:39:44,382
I couldn'’t be more happier.
You make my life--"

1227
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,797
Wait a minute.
Does it say "more happier?"

1228
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:47,143
[laughter]

1229
00:39:47,143 --> 00:39:48,800
[Roger]
Does it really say
"more happier?"

1230
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,939
Why?
Does that not make sense?

1231
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:52,182
- No.
- Who wrote this, Lorenzo?

1232
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:53,736
It just means
I'’m really happy.

1233
00:39:53,736 --> 00:39:55,220
She'’s extra happy.

1234
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,705
[Jionni]
I understand what it meant,
and I appreciate it.

1235
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:00,915
I'’m more happier too.

1236
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:03,642
Honestly, for me,
and I think same for you,

1237
00:40:03,642 --> 00:40:05,299
to me, every day
is Dad Appreciation Day

1238
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:06,265
that I get to spend
with my little girl,

1239
00:40:06,265 --> 00:40:07,439
you know what I mean?

1240
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:09,303
[all]
Aww.

1241
00:40:09,303 --> 00:40:10,753
No, I really mean that.

1242
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:12,306
I'’m actually getting choked up.

1243
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:14,308
[all]
Aww.

1244
00:40:14,308 --> 00:40:16,828
Always been an emotional guy,
always have,

1245
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:18,174
but I'’ve never been a guy
that wore that

1246
00:40:18,174 --> 00:40:19,589
on his sleeve,
you know what I mean?

1247
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:22,281
I cry all the time now,
just tears of happiness,

1248
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:24,387
'’cause my kid is
that important,

1249
00:40:24,387 --> 00:40:27,390
and affects me emotionally
that much, and I don'’t care.

1250
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,012
I could care less
what people think.

1251
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:31,532
- [bleep] "yous."
- Yeah, [bleep] "yous."

1252
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:32,947
Jionni?

1253
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:34,639
[both laughing]

1254
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:36,813
How can I top that?

1255
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:40,230
[both laughing]

1256
00:40:47,824 --> 00:40:49,170
[JWOWW]
Next time, on Snooki &amp; JWOWW...

1257
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,587
We'’re going to Miami
for my bachelorette party.

1258
00:40:51,587 --> 00:40:56,350
[all cheering]

1259
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:59,111
I look up, there'’s
a "Rest In Peace Jionni" sign

1260
00:40:59,111 --> 00:41:00,596
bannered on the wall.

1261
00:41:00,596 --> 00:41:02,529
- Who played that sick joke?
- [laughs]

1262
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:05,463
Did you get a lap dance
from anyone?

1263
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,394
Jionni!
