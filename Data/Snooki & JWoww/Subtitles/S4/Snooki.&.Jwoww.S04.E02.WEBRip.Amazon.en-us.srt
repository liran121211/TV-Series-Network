THAT SHE WON'’T HEAR THE DOGS.

511
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:06,032
SHUT UP!

512
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:08,068
- SO I GOT SOME PLANS TODAY.

513
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:11,693
SINCE JENNI'’S STRESSED OUT ABOUT
BEING A MOM, DELIVERING,

514
00:20:11,693 --> 00:20:14,213
I JUST FEEL LIKE SHE NEEDS TO
GET HER MIND OFF OF IT A LITTLE.

515
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,077
SO I WANT TO THROW HER
A LITTLE BABY SHOWER.

516
00:20:17,077 --> 00:20:18,113
- REALLY?

517
00:20:18,113 --> 00:20:19,079
- AND INVITE A FEW
OF HER FRIENDS.

518
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,460
- DOES SHE KNOW?
- NO.

519
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,013
IT'’LL BE, LIKE,
A LITTLE SURPRISE.

520
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,257
I THINK JENNI'’S GETTING
STRESSED OUT BECAUSE HER LIFE

521
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,638
IS TOTALLY GONNA CHANGE.

522
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:28,572
SO I REALLY WANT TO THROW JENNI
A SURPRISE BABY SHOWER

523
00:20:28,572 --> 00:20:31,954
BEFORE THE BABY COMES OUT
AND RIPS HER VAGINA OPEN.

524
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:34,302
AND I WANT TO MAKE
HER THIS CAKE.

525
00:20:34,302 --> 00:20:35,682
- OH, YEAH?

526
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:38,685
- BUT IT'’S NOT LIKE
YOUR AVERAGE BABY SHOWER CAKE.

527
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,687
IT'’S SO GROSS.

528
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:41,895
- EW.

529
00:20:41,895 --> 00:20:43,828
THIS IS, LIKE, DISTURBING.

530
00:20:43,828 --> 00:20:45,313
[dog barking]

531
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:46,383
- NOEL, SHUT UP!

532
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:50,179
I'’M SORRY I'’M NO HELP.

533
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:52,389
I'’M TRYING TO GET MY WATER
TO BREAK OVER HERE.

534
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:53,493
I HOPE THAT WORKS.

535
00:20:55,426 --> 00:20:56,738
- I KNEW THAT WASN'’T GONNA WORK.

536
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:58,912
- SOUNDPROOFING
ISN'’T GOING SO WELL.

537
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:00,983
- WE CAN'’T USE ADHESIVE SPRAY,

538
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:03,538
BECAUSE I DON'’T FEEL SAFE
SPRAYING IT IN THE BABY'’S ROOM.

539
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:05,643
SO WE'’RE USING
DOUBLE-SIDED TAPE,

540
00:21:05,643 --> 00:21:07,542
WHICH ISN'’T WORKING SO WELL.

541
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:08,888
I'’M TRYING IT ONE MORE TIME.

542
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:13,479
NOPE.
- WE NEED BETTER TAPE.

543
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,483
- BE BACK.

544
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:19,864
I'’M GONNA GO SEE
HOW AUNT JENNI'’S DOING.

545
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:20,831
BYE.

546
00:21:24,697 --> 00:21:25,836
GOD.

547
00:21:25,836 --> 00:21:26,802
OOH!

548
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:27,838
[dogs barking]

549
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:30,634
HEY, GUYS.
- SHUT UP!

550
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,083
- HELLO?

551
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,119
- HEY, BOO!

552
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,914
- WHERE ARE YOU?

553
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:36,950
- SHUT UP!
- HEY, GUYS.

554
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,124
- HI.
- HI.

555
00:21:38,124 --> 00:21:39,470
- I HAVEN'’T HEARD
FROM YOU ALL DAY.

556
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,438
- YOU'’RE CUTE.
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

557
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:44,855
- WE'’RE--WE'’RE DOING A LITTLE--
A LITTLE BIT OF SOUNDPROOFING.

558
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:47,375
DID YOU HEAR THAT NOISE
WHEN YOU WALKED INTO THE HOUSE?

559
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:48,617
- YES.
- WE'’RE--WE'’RE TRYING

560
00:21:48,617 --> 00:21:50,550
TO SAVE OUR DAUGHTER FROM THAT.

561
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,965
- WELL, IF YOU SOUNDPROOF
THE ROOM,

562
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:53,415
HOW ARE YOU GONNA HEAR HER CRY?

563
00:21:56,384 --> 00:21:58,593
THEN AGAIN,
YOU WANT TO HEAR HER CRY TOO.

564
00:21:58,593 --> 00:22:00,319
- YOU PICKING--
YOU PICKING THIS APART?

565
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,250
- NO.

566
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,599
- TRY IT OUT.
I'’LL SHUT THE DOOR.

567
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,669
YOU YELL INTO IT.

568
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:06,946
- SO YOU WANT ME
TO YELL OUT HERE?

569
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:09,328
- BARK LIKE A DOG.
BARK LIKE A DOG.

570
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,570
GO.

571
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,608
- [barking]

572
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:15,437
[dogs barking]

573
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:17,128
[laughter]

574
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:19,717
- IT DOESN'’T WORK AT ALL.
AT ALL.

575
00:22:19,717 --> 00:22:20,856
- I BLAME IT ON THE PREGNANCY.

576
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:22,271
- LISTEN, YOU HAVE GOOD IDEAS.

577
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:23,756
IT JUST--

578
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,999
YOU GOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

579
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:27,863
- THAT'’S...
[laughs] COMING FROM YOU.

580
00:22:27,863 --> 00:22:30,210
- I'’M GONNA GO ON RECORD NOW
AND SAY YOU'’RE A GENIUS.

581
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,729
- WHAT'’D I DO?

582
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:33,800
- [laughing]

583
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,492
I'’M ACTUALLY SHOCKED THAT
NICOLE ACTUALLY KNOWS SOMETHING.

584
00:22:35,492 --> 00:22:36,665
- YEAH.

585
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:37,735
- OW.

586
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,806
- "A" FOR EFFORT.
YOU LOOK SO CUTE.

587
00:22:39,806 --> 00:22:41,325
JUST WAIT FOR THAT MUCUS PLUG.

588
00:22:41,325 --> 00:22:43,258
- OH, WE'’VE ALREADY--SUPPOSEDLY,

589
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:45,260
JENNI'’S ALREADY SEEN
SOME SIGNS OF THAT.

590
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,572
- THAT MEANS SHE'’S COMING.
- HURRY UP.

591
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:47,780
- IT MEANS SHE'’S GONNA
BE HERE VERY SOON.

592
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,816
- YOU MIGHT BE IN LABOR 27 HOURS
LIKE I WAS.

593
00:22:53,233 --> 00:22:55,546
- CAN YOU IMAGINE?
- IT HONESTLY WASN'’T THAT BAD.

594
00:22:55,546 --> 00:22:57,272
ONCE I GOT THE EPIDURAL,
I DIDN'’T FEEL ANYTHING.

595
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,480
- YOU HAD AN EPIDURAL,

596
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,758
SO HOW MUCH--WERE YOU FEELING
ANY PAIN, OR NO?

597
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:02,450
- NO PAIN.
JUST A LOT OF PRESSURE.

598
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,866
WITH THE EPIDURAL, THANK GOD
I DIDN'’T FEEL THAT,

599
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:06,937
BUT HE WAS, LIKE,
ELBOW-DEEP IN [bleep] VAGINA.

600
00:23:06,937 --> 00:23:08,007
- A LOT OF PRESSURE?
- LIKE, I FELT--

601
00:23:08,007 --> 00:23:09,284
- LIKE YOU HAD TO POOP?

602
00:23:09,284 --> 00:23:11,838
- A WATERMELON COME OUT. YEAH.
- THAT'’S WEIRD.

603
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:12,977
- YEAH, LIKE--
- YOU GET [bleep].

604
00:23:12,977 --> 00:23:15,324
- [bleep] DEEP BY YOUR DOCTOR.

605
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:16,912
YEAH.

606
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:18,500
- WHAT IF THEY HAVE BIG HANDS?

607
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,676
- OH, AND ONCE THAT LAST PUSH
AND THE BABY'’S OUT,

608
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:23,505
DOES THAT ALL SUBSIDE?
THAT ALL GOES AWAY? NO PAIN?

609
00:23:23,505 --> 00:23:25,093
- BUT THEN YOU GOT TO PUSH
THE PLACENTA OUT.

610
00:23:25,093 --> 00:23:26,405
SO YOU GIVE BIRTH TWICE.
- OH, GOD. ALL RIGHT.

611
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,785
I'’M SORRY I ASKED.

612
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:29,235
ALL RIGHT. THAT'’S GOOD.
- THEN IT ALL JUST FLOPS OUT.

613
00:23:29,235 --> 00:23:31,479
[gabbles]

614
00:23:31,479 --> 00:23:33,722
AND THEN YOU GET STITCHED UP.

615
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:35,068
I'’M SCARING YOU.
I'’M GONNA GO NOW.

616
00:23:35,068 --> 00:23:36,311
- YEAH.

617
00:23:36,311 --> 00:23:37,623
LEARNED A LOT, HERE. THANK YOU.
- SEE YOU LATER.

618
00:23:37,623 --> 00:23:39,107
- THANK YOU.
- BYE, LOVE YOU.

619
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:41,799
[dog barking]

620
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:44,526
- FOR THE 45TH TIME,
CAN YOU JUST YELL AT THOSE DOGS?

621
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:45,734
- SHUT UP!

622
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:59,058
- I HAVE A LOT TO DO
FOR JENNI'’S BABY SHOWER.

623
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:00,369
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE GROCERY STORE

624
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:04,615
TO GET ALL THE FOOD
AND YUMMY STUFF.

625
00:24:04,615 --> 00:24:07,584
CHEESE.

626
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:08,999
FRUIT.

627
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:12,174
WHOA, THOSE ARE THE BIGGEST
BALLS I'’VE EVER SEEN.

628
00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:14,625
OH, GRANDMA UNDERWEAR.

629
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,697
COOL.

630
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:22,875
[bleep].

631
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,704
I KIND OF WANT TO DO TWO CAKES.

632
00:24:24,704 --> 00:24:26,361
WHAT IF ONE CAKE
LOOKS LIKE [bleep]?

633
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:29,364
THEN I HAVE ANOTHER CAKE
TO SHOW EVERYBODY.

634
00:24:29,364 --> 00:24:33,126
I'’M GONNA POOP MY PANTS.

635
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:36,544
UM, I DON'’T THINK
I CAN REACH THAT.

636
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:37,924
IT'’S, LIKE, PUSH CAKE, LIKE,

637
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:40,271
YOU KNOW, GET READY TO PUSH
THE BABY OUT OF YOUR VAG.

638
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,583
- THOSE ARE ALL THE ONES
THAT WE HAVE.

639
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:43,205
- OKAY.

640
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:44,690
CAN YOU REACH?

641
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,243
OH, YOUR ARM'’S BROKEN.

642
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:49,764
CAN YOU REACH?

643
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:51,559
- WHICH ONE?
- THE PINK.

644
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,146
SHE'’S HAVING A GIRL.

645
00:24:53,146 --> 00:24:55,977
IT'’S HER FAVORITE COLORS,
PINK AND BLACK.

646
00:24:55,977 --> 00:24:57,737
I HAVE A QUESTION.
- WHAT?

647
00:24:57,737 --> 00:24:59,739
- I'’M TRYING TO MAKE HER
A REALLY VULGAR CAKE,

648
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:01,569
AND IT LOOKS LIKE A VAGINA.

649
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:06,988
- JUST SLICE IT AND THEN JUST
PUT ALL YOUR STUFF IN THERE.

650
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:09,404
WHEN YOU PUT THE ICING ON,
JUST KIND OF RAISE THE ICING

651
00:25:09,404 --> 00:25:11,199
UP A LITTLE BIT
IN THE CORNER WHERE YOU CUT IT,

652
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,752
SO IT'’LL LOOK JUST LIKE THAT.

653
00:25:12,752 --> 00:25:14,927
- AND IT LOOKS LIKE A VAGINA?
- IT'’LL LOOK JUST LIKE THAT.

654
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:16,963
- OKAY. COOL.

655
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:18,586
THAT'’S ALL I NEED.

656
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:19,932
WE'’RE GOOD.
- ALL RIGHT.

657
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:21,520
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'’RE WELCOME, HONEY.

658
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:27,526
- THANK YOU, GUYS.

659
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,424
I FEEL LIKE I GOT ENOUGH STUFF
FOR THE PARTY

660
00:25:29,424 --> 00:25:32,427
WITH THE FOOD, THE CHIPS,
THE DESSERT, THE CAKES.

661
00:25:32,427 --> 00:25:34,360
NOW I JUST
NEED TO SET IT ALL UP.

662
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,225
OH, HI, BABY.

663
00:25:37,225 --> 00:25:38,813
- HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

664
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:41,229
- I NEED HELP.
- WITH?

665
00:25:41,229 --> 00:25:44,646
- I BOUGHT ALL THESE BALLOONS
AND DECORATIONS FOR THE PARTY,

666
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:47,166
BUT I DON'’T WANT JENNI
TO SEE IT WHEN I BRING IT IN.

667
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,408
- OKAY.
- SO WE GOT TO BE,

668
00:25:48,408 --> 00:25:50,134
LIKE, SECRET AGENTS
AND SNEAK INTO THE HOUSE.

669
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:51,584
- RIGHT NOW?
- YEAH.

670
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,828
IF THERE WAS ONE DREAM JOB
I COULD HAVE,

671
00:25:53,828 --> 00:25:58,004
I'’D WANT TO BE A SECRET AGENT,
LIKE SCARLETT JOHANSSON.

672
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:01,076
AND JIONNI WOULD LIKE THAT
BECAUSE HE LOVES ME.

673
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:08,463
SO I HAVE TO GO
SECRET-AGENT STYLE

674
00:26:08,463 --> 00:26:11,293
AND MAKE SURE
THAT JENNI'’S NOT LOOKING.

675
00:26:11,293 --> 00:26:12,294
[grunts]

676
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:13,330
OH, MAN.

677
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:16,402
I JUST TINKLED IN MY PANTS.

678
00:26:16,402 --> 00:26:18,542
I CAN'’T BREATHE.

679
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:21,165
CLEAR.

680
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:22,650
I'’M GONNA GIVE BIRTH.

681
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,410
- NICOLE WOULD NOT MAKE
A GREAT SPY.

682
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:25,963
SHE'’S TOO LOUD TO BE A SPY.

683
00:26:25,963 --> 00:26:26,964
- COME ON. COME ON.

684
00:26:26,964 --> 00:26:28,069
BALLOONS, COME ON.

685
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:28,966
COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

686
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:33,143
COME ON, BABY.

687
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:34,523
- I GET EVERYTHING
INTO OUR HOUSE,

688
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:35,732
AND I REALLY, REALLY HOPE

689
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:38,251
SHE DIDN'’T SEE ME
BRING ALL THIS STUFF IN.

690
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:40,909
- I DON'’T KNOW WHAT I'’M DOING.

691
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:42,014
- DON'’T MESS IT UP.

692
00:26:42,014 --> 00:26:43,360
- WELL, I DON'’T KNOW
HOW TO DO IT.

693
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,396
- YOU JUST POUR IT IN
AND SWIRL IT.

694
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,915
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

695
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:52,162
- WELL, GO AHEAD,
AUNT JEMIMA, DO IT.

696
00:26:52,162 --> 00:26:54,785
- WHO'’S AUNT JEMIMA?

697
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:56,269
WHO IS AUNT JEMIMA?

698
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:59,341
- ISN'’T SHE THE LADY ON
THE--COOKER? I DON'’T KNOW.

699
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:00,549
SHE HAS TO DO SOMETHING
WITH COOKING.

700
00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:02,275
- I NEVER HEARD OF AUNT JEMIMA
IN MY LIFE.

701
00:27:02,275 --> 00:27:04,174
- SHE MIGHT BE ON THE--
I FORGOT THE BOX.

702
00:27:04,174 --> 00:27:05,831
- MARTHA STEWART?
- NO.

703
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:08,454
I DON'’T THINK
THIS IS THE RIGHT SIZE PAN.

704
00:27:08,454 --> 00:27:10,042
- NO ONE SAID WE WERE BAKERS.

705
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:15,219
- BEST I CAN DO.

706
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,256
WHAT'’S THIS?

707
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:18,982
- IT'’S GONNA BE THE BABY.

708
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:22,813
[laughs]

709
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:24,056
- WAIT A SECOND.

710
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:25,954
YOU'’RE GONNA PUT PAINT
ON THE CAKE?

711
00:27:25,954 --> 00:27:27,266
- YEAH.

712
00:27:27,266 --> 00:27:29,406
- YOU KNOW IT'’S NOT EDIBLE?
- I KNOW, JIONNI.

713
00:27:29,406 --> 00:27:30,925
IT'’S JUST FOR SHOW.

714
00:27:30,925 --> 00:27:33,755
CHEAP BARBIE.
- ALL RIGHT. GOOD LUCK.

715
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:35,515
- I WANT TO MAKE
THIS BARBIE LOOK LIKE JENNI,

716
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:38,139
SO SHE KNOWS IT'’S HER CAKE.

717
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:40,244
JENNI HAS A DRAGON.

718
00:27:40,244 --> 00:27:42,522
I'’M PUTTING HER TATTOOS ON HER.

719
00:27:42,522 --> 00:27:43,903
A CAT HERE.

720
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:45,180
SHE HAS ONE ON HER ANKLE.

721
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,182
DOES SHE HAVE ANY OTHER TATTOOS?

722
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:48,667
- SHE HAS ONE ON HER BUTT CHEEK.

723
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,013
- SHE HAS ONE ON HER BUTT CHEEK?

724
00:27:50,013 --> 00:27:51,739
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

725
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:53,568
I'’M GONNA PUT PASTIES
ON HER BOOB.

726
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:55,570
SHE LIKES PASTIES.

727
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,021
I BASICALLY JUST
HAVE TO PUT THE BARBIE ON

728
00:27:58,021 --> 00:28:01,162
WITH THE LITTLE SCARY HEAD
COMING OUT OF THE VAGINA,

729
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:02,853
LIKE SHE'’S GIVING BIRTH.

730
00:28:02,853 --> 00:28:08,825
SHE GOT A TAN BABY
WITH EYELASHES COMING OUT.

731
00:28:08,825 --> 00:28:11,379
WHAT A BEAUTY.

732
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,761
AND THEN I HAVE TO WRITE
"PUSH, JENNI, PUSH."

733
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:16,142
SO I FEEL LIKE THAT CAKE
IS THE EASY CAKE.

734
00:28:20,422 --> 00:28:22,631
OH, [bleep].

735
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:24,219
IT'’S STUCK.

736
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:32,020
WHOA.

737
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,023
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?

738
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:37,612
VICTORY.

739
00:28:37,612 --> 00:28:41,512
JUST A LITTLE STICKAGE.
IT'’S NOT BAD.

740
00:28:41,512 --> 00:28:42,962
AND I HAVE TO CUT OUT,

741
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:46,103
LIKE, A--WHAT'’S THIS SHAPE?

742
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:47,104
- VAGINA?

743
00:28:47,104 --> 00:28:49,072
- NO--WHY YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT?

744
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:50,556
"VAGINA."

745
00:28:55,078 --> 00:28:56,665
EW.

746
00:28:56,665 --> 00:29:00,117
THE CHERRIES RESEMBLE
THE PLACENTA AND THE BLOOD

747
00:29:00,117 --> 00:29:01,153
WHEN THE BABY COMES OUT.

748
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:02,292
- THAT'’S NASTY.

749
00:29:02,292 --> 00:29:04,950
- IT'’S LIKE A PERIOD.

750
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,745
EW, A VAGINA.

751
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,125
- YOU'’RE SICK.

752
00:29:08,125 --> 00:29:09,333
- AND THEN ADD THE SPRINKLES

753
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:11,266
FOR LITTLE PUBES.

754
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:12,267
[both chuckle]

755
00:29:12,267 --> 00:29:14,097
I NEED A BUTTHOLE.

756
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:16,513
AND THEN SOME SPRINKLES
ON THE BUTTHOLE,

757
00:29:16,513 --> 00:29:18,653
'’CAUSE I DON'’T KNOW
IF HER BUTT'’S HAIRY.

758
00:29:21,276 --> 00:29:24,417
HOW DO YOU POP THE HEAD OFF?

759
00:29:24,417 --> 00:29:25,349
BABE, I'’M SCARED.

760
00:29:29,215 --> 00:29:30,630
[laughs]

761
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,218
BABE, STOP.

762
00:29:34,117 --> 00:29:36,982
AWW.

763
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:38,328
THAT'’S CREEPY.

764
00:29:38,328 --> 00:29:39,501
THAT IS CREEPY.

765
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:41,262
- [moans]
- OH, STOP!

766
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:45,335
THAT--THAT LOOKS PHENOMENAL.

767
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:46,508
- GROSS.

768
00:29:46,508 --> 00:29:49,097
- ALL RIGHT, MY JOB
IS DONE FOR THE DAY.

769
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:49,995
I'’M CHECKING OUT.

770
00:29:54,862 --> 00:29:56,725
- WHO'’S GONNA HELP MAMA?

771
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:57,830
- ME.

772
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,073
- ME.
- THERE YOU GO.

773
00:29:59,073 --> 00:30:01,627
- COME ON. WE GOT TO GET
JENNI'’S SHOWER READY.

774
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:04,595
I'’VE NEVER PLANNED A BABY SHOWER
BEFORE, AND I'’M REALLY NERVOUS.

775
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:05,769
- LET'’S WORK DOUBLE TIME.

776
00:30:08,151 --> 00:30:10,670
- CROWN.

777
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:12,120
- I NEED TAPE.

778
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,985
- HOW WOULD I DO THIS?

779
00:30:14,985 --> 00:30:15,986
BABY.

780
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:17,919
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE A TURD.

781
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,300
I DEFINITELY WANT TO GET
EVERYTHING DONE

782
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,060
BEFORE JENNI'’S FRIENDS
COME OVER,

783
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,684
SO I JUST FEEL LIKE WE'’RE
RACING THE TIME RIGHT NOW.

784
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:25,685
THE STREAMERS ARE RUINED.

785
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:30,173
DID YOU EVER PLAY
THE DIRTY DIAPER GAME?

786
00:30:30,173 --> 00:30:31,415
- NO. HOW DOES THAT WORK?

787
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,417
- YOU GOT TO GUESS...
- EW!

788
00:30:33,417 --> 00:30:35,937
- WHICH CHOCOLATE
IS IN THE THE DIAPIE.

789
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,939
JUST TO MAKE
IT FUN AND INTERESTING,

790
00:30:37,939 --> 00:30:39,976
I HAVE GAMES
TO PLAY AT THE BABY SHOWER.

791
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:41,770
ONE IS THE POOP GAME
IN THE DIAPER.

792
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:45,153
SO YOU GET CHOCOLATES,
AND THEN YOU MELT THE CHOCOLATES

793
00:30:45,153 --> 00:30:48,329
IN THE DIAPER, AND THEN YOU SEE
WHAT KIND OF CHOCOLATE IT IS.

794
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:50,572
EW.
[gags]

795
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:52,022
AND A LOT OF OTHER STUFF.

796
00:30:52,022 --> 00:30:54,680
I JUST WANT THE PARTY
TO BE NICE AND FUN AND CUTE,

797
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,096
AND NOT, LIKE, BORING,
LIKE WE'’RE JUST SITTING THERE.

798
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:58,926
ALL RIGHT, THE GIRLS
ARE GONNA BE HERE SOON.

799
00:30:58,926 --> 00:31:01,169
- I ACTUALLY GOT TO GO
HELP ROGER, ANYWAY.

800
00:31:01,169 --> 00:31:03,723
- WHILE I'’M THROWING JENNI
THE BABY SHOWER, YOU AND ROGER--

801
00:31:03,723 --> 00:31:06,002
- I'’LL BE HELPING ROGER
WITH THE NURSERY.

802
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:07,486
- BECAUSE I WANT
TO SURPRISE JENNI

803
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:10,351
AND SHOW HER
MEILANI'’S FINISHED NURSERY.

804
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:12,594
YOU KNOW, JUST SO EVERYTHING
IS GOOD FOR THE BABY

805
00:31:12,594 --> 00:31:14,355
WHEN SHE GIVES BIRTH.

806
00:31:14,355 --> 00:31:15,943
[doorbell rings]

807
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:21,327
[bleep] GRANNY PANTIES.

808
00:31:21,327 --> 00:31:22,535
OH, I CAN'’T.

809
00:31:25,607 --> 00:31:26,954
HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.

810
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:29,163
THE GIRLS ARE HERE,
BUT I'’M LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,

811
00:31:29,163 --> 00:31:31,406
GET IN THE HOUSE
SO JENNI DOESN'’T SEE YOU GUYS,"

812
00:31:31,406 --> 00:31:33,443
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE SHE CAN JUST
LOOK OUT HER WINDOW

813
00:31:33,443 --> 00:31:35,065
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE RUINED.

814
00:31:35,065 --> 00:31:37,240
- OH, MY GOD.
- OH, YEAH, THE CAKES.

815
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,620
- OH, MY--
- DID YOU MAKE THESE?

816
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,898
- YEAH. I MADE THEM.

817
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,416
- THIS IS HYSTERICAL.
- YEAH.

818
00:31:41,416 --> 00:31:43,004
- OH, MY GOD, AN ACTUAL VAGINA?

819
00:31:43,004 --> 00:31:44,833
- MM-HMM. I GOOGLED.

820
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:46,111
- THAT'’S AMAZING.

821
00:31:46,111 --> 00:31:47,146
- ALL RIGHT,
SO NOW THAT YOU GUYS ARE HERE,

822
00:31:47,146 --> 00:31:48,837
I'’M GONNA CALL HER.

823
00:31:48,837 --> 00:31:50,046
- HELLO?

824
00:31:50,046 --> 00:31:51,702
- HI, BOO.

825
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,463
- HI.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

826
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:55,258
- PISSING OFF MY DOGS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

827
00:31:55,258 --> 00:31:56,845
- DO YOU WANT TO COME HANG OUT?

828
00:31:56,845 --> 00:32:00,090
BECAUSE JIONNI BROUGHT LORENZO
TO THE PARK, AND I'’M BORED.

829
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,643
- YEAH, SURE.

830
00:32:01,643 --> 00:32:02,921
- ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU SOON.

831
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,785
- OKAY, BYE.
- BYE.

832
00:32:05,785 --> 00:32:08,443
- CAN YOU NOT LICK YOURSELF
ON MY BED?

833
00:32:08,443 --> 00:32:10,514
- ALL RIGHT. COME IN HERE.

834
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:11,722
[mumbles softly]

835
00:32:13,897 --> 00:32:15,140
- GET LOW.

836
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:18,039
SHE'’S COMING.

837
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,420
- CIAO, CIAO.

838
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,421
OH, MY GOD.

839
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:21,422
all: SURPRISE!

840
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:22,595
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

841
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:24,528
- HI.

842
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:27,290
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

843
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,601
NO WAY.

844
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:30,120
I HATE SURPRISES.

845
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,295
EVERYONE THAT KNOWS ME
KNOWS I DON'’T DO SURPRISES.

846
00:32:32,295 --> 00:32:34,953
- COME IN.
COME SEE OUR DECORATIONS.

847
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,885
- IF I DID, I WOULDN'’T HAVE
SHOWED UP IN COWBOY BOOTS

848
00:32:36,885 --> 00:32:38,922
AND A GREEN SWEATER.

849
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:40,061
OH, MY GOD, WHO MADE THAT?

850
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:41,166
- I MADE THESE CAKES
THIS MORNING.

851
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:42,339
- YOU DID?
- YEAH. DO YOU LOVE THEM?

852
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:44,031
- EW!
OH, THAT'’S A BUTTHOLE.

853
00:32:44,031 --> 00:32:46,033
- EVEN THOUGH THIS CAKE
LOOKS VULGAR AND DISGUSTING,

854
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:48,035
THE CAKE
IS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD.

855
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:49,933
- NOT BAD.

856
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:51,935
- VULGAR?
YOU PUT A HEMORRHOID ON IT.

857
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:54,662
- NO, THAT WAS--OH, YEAH,
A BUTTHOLE WITH A HEMORRHOID.

858
00:32:54,662 --> 00:32:57,113
THAT'’S '’CAUSE YOU HAVE ONE.

859
00:32:57,113 --> 00:32:58,114
- THANKS.

860
00:32:58,114 --> 00:32:59,529
HERE'’S YOUR BUTTHOLE.

861
00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:00,909
[laughter]

862
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:03,947

863
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:05,259

867
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:15,234
- ROGER?

868
00:33:15,234 --> 00:33:18,824
- I'’M UP HERE, LITTLE BUDDY.

869
00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:19,998
- WHAT'’S GOING ON?

870
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,516
- GOT TO FINISH PAINTING
THIS ROOM.

871
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:23,277
- I HAD TO GET
OUT OF THAT HOUSE.

872
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:25,382
- TOO MUCH ESTROGEN OVER THERE?
- HELL, YEAH.

873
00:33:25,382 --> 00:33:27,626
- TOO MANY LEAKING NIPPLES?
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

874
00:33:27,626 --> 00:33:32,182
- I DON'’T KNOW IF JIONNI
WILL BE A BIG HELP,

875
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:34,840
BUT MY SUSPICION
IS HE'’LL BE A LITTLE HELP.

876
00:33:36,117 --> 00:33:40,570
THAT'’S TEAMWORK, RIGHT THERE.

877
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,124
I AM HIS LADDER.

878
00:33:43,124 --> 00:33:46,541
SO GIVE ME THE RUNDOWN
ON WHAT TO EXPECT.

879
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:49,337
- YOU JUST GOT TO, YOU KNOW,
STAY CALM, STAY POSITIVE.

880
00:33:51,374 --> 00:33:53,169
EVEN THOUGH HER VAGINA'’S
NOT GONNA LOOK GOOD,

881
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:55,447
JUST SAY IT DOES.

882
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:57,242
STAY POSITIVE.
DON'’T LOOK AT HER VAGINA.

883
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:59,209
PLEASE, MAN,
DON'’T LOOK AT THE VAGINA.

884
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:00,624
JUST DON'’T--DON'’T DO IT.

885
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:02,281
- IT'’S LIKE LOOKING
AT THE SURFACE OF THE SUN?

886
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:03,489
- YEAH, PLEASE DON'’T.
DON'’T.

887
00:34:03,489 --> 00:34:04,697
STAY BEHIND HER.

888
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:05,871
OH, MY GOD.
SHE'’S GONNA BE FARTING.

889
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:07,183
IT'’S GONNA STINK.

890
00:34:07,183 --> 00:34:09,047
SHE'’S NOT GONNA KNOW.
I'’M NOT KIDDING.

891
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,358
SHE GOT THE--

892
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:11,635
- EPIDURAL?
- EPIDURAL.

893
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:14,880
YOU DON'’T FEEL ANYTHING
FROM YOUR VAGINA DOWN,

894
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:17,400
AND SHE WAS JUST BLOWING ASS
THE ENTIRE TIME.

895
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,747
- WHAT ABOUT THIS MIRACLE
OF LIFE I KEEP HEARING ABOUT

896
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:21,128
AND WHAT A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT
IT IS?

897
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:22,336
EVERYTHING
YOU'’VE DESCRIBED IS HORRIBLE.

898
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,820
- YOU'’LL GET THERE.
YOU'’LL GET THERE.

899
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,892
IT JUST--
RIGHT BEFORE MEILANI COMES OUT,

900
00:34:26,892 --> 00:34:29,515
IT SMELLS LIKE ASS, OKAY?

901
00:34:29,515 --> 00:34:31,586
IT--JENNI'’S GONNA BE YELLING.

902
00:34:31,586 --> 00:34:33,623
YOU KNOW, JUST TELL HER
HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKS.

903
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:37,005
JUST STAY POSITIVE, BECAUSE
IF YOU FOLD AND SHE FOLDS?

904
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:38,179
- IT'’S BAD.

905
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,594
- YOU [bleep] ASS[bleep].

906
00:34:39,594 --> 00:34:41,665
- WHAT?

907
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:43,598
- I LIKE THESE SHORTS.

908
00:34:49,432 --> 00:34:51,158
- YOU KNOW THE DIAPER GAME?
- MM-HMM.

909
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:52,883
- WELL,
YOU LOOK INTO THE DIAPER.

910
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,369
YOU GOT TO EXAMINE IT, SMELL IT,

911
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:59,476
MAYBE TASTE IT TO SEE
WHAT KIND OF CANDY IT IS.

912
00:34:59,476 --> 00:35:02,272
- THAT'’S REALLY DISGUSTING.
- DOESN'’T IT LOOK REAL?

913
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,687
- IT'’S DEFINITELY A TYPE
OF CANDY?

914
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,448
- YEAH, THEY'’RE ALL CANDY.

915
00:35:05,448 --> 00:35:07,622
JUST TELL ME
WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

916
00:35:07,622 --> 00:35:09,003
- EW.
THAT'’S A PAYDAY.

917
00:35:09,003 --> 00:35:10,798
- TOTAL BUTTERFINGER.
- OH, IT'’S A BABY RUTH.

918
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:13,180
- SNICKERS AND CARAMEL,
NOU--SOME NOUGAT.

919
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,905
- YEAH.

920
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:17,701
- NOUGAT.
NOUGAT IS THIS GUY RIGHT HERE.

921
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,186
- EW.

922
00:35:19,186 --> 00:35:20,187
WHAT'’S A NOUGAT?

923
00:35:20,187 --> 00:35:21,912
- IT'’S PART OF THE CHOCOLATE.

924
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,431
- LIKE A NUGGET?

925
00:35:23,431 --> 00:35:25,157
- BUT IT'’S NOUGAT.

926
00:35:25,157 --> 00:35:27,435
- HOLD ON,
LET ME--LET ME MAKE SURE.

927
00:35:27,435 --> 00:35:29,575
- EW.
- MM, THAT'’S NOUGAT.

928
00:35:29,575 --> 00:35:31,059
[laughs]

929
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:32,475
- NASTY.

930
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:34,235
- [laughing]

931
00:35:34,235 --> 00:35:36,306
- WE CAN MAKE A DIAPER.

932
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:38,308
READY. SET.
GO.

933
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:39,827
- OW!

934
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:41,518
[laughter]

935
00:35:41,518 --> 00:35:42,623
- THIS LOOKS GREAT.

936
00:35:42,623 --> 00:35:44,590
I'’M ALREADY WINNING,
I CAN TELL.

937
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,765
- WINNER!
- HANDS BEHIND YOUR BACK.

938
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:49,216
- WHOA. THERE IT IS.

939
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:51,287
- STIMULATE YOUR NIPPLES
WHILE BOUNCING ON THE BALL.

940
00:35:51,287 --> 00:35:53,392
IT'’S TO HELP YOU GIVE BIRTH.

941
00:35:53,392 --> 00:35:55,291
- COME ON, NOW.
RUB THE NIPPLES.

942
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:56,430
- EW!

943
00:35:58,225 --> 00:35:59,709
- JENNI IS GONNA BE HAPPY.

944
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:01,297
OH, THAT'’S NICE.

945
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:03,609
- YEAH, A LITTLE BALLERINA.

946
00:36:03,609 --> 00:36:05,680
JIONNI AND I SHOULD OPEN
OUR OWN PAINTING COMPANY.

947
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,372
I MEAN, WE CRUSHED IT.
- I'’M PRETTY IMPRESSED.

948
00:36:07,372 --> 00:36:08,718
WE DID GOOD.
- YEAH.

949
00:36:08,718 --> 00:36:11,065
NOW COME SIT ON DADDY'’S LAP.

950
00:36:11,065 --> 00:36:12,239
THANKS, BUDDY.

951
00:36:15,345 --> 00:36:17,520
- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING.
- OF COURSE.

952
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,591
- THE SHOWER
WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,

953
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:21,765
AND I WAS GENUINELY SURPRISED.

954
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,146
- I'’M DOUBLY HAPPY
I PULLED THIS OFF

955
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:24,975
BECAUSE I LITERALLY HAD A DAY.

956
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:27,115
I MEAN, IT WAS DEFINITELY A
LITTLE STRESSFUL, BUT IT WORKED.

957
00:36:27,115 --> 00:36:28,703
- YEAH, I CAN'’T BELIEVE
ONE OF MY [bleep] FRIENDS

958
00:36:28,703 --> 00:36:29,946
DIDN'’T TELL ME.

959
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:31,016
- I'’M SURPRISED
I DIDN'’T TELL YOU.

960
00:36:31,016 --> 00:36:32,535
- YEAH.
YOU'’RE ONE OF THEM.

961
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:38,092
- OH, SOMETHING'’S LEAKING
OUT OF ME.

962
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:40,819
I SWEAR TO GOD.
- STOP.

963
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:42,130
- I SAID I HAD TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

964
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,373
I WASN'’T KIDDING.

965
00:36:43,373 --> 00:36:45,686
- IS IT PEE,
OR DID YOUR WATER BREAK?

966
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:47,481
- IT LOOKED LIKE SNOT.

967
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:49,241
- THAT'’S YOUR MUCUS PLUG.

968
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:51,070
- I THINK IT IS.

969
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,762
- YOU'’RE GOING INTO LABOR.

970
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,039
- WHAT'’S COMING OUT OF ME?

971
00:36:56,421 --> 00:36:58,319
- THIS EPISODE
OF SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW...

972
00:36:58,319 --> 00:36:59,527
- CONTINUES NOW.

973
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,878
- IT'’S JUST MUCUSY.

974
00:37:05,878 --> 00:37:07,639
- SHOW ME. IT MIGHT BE
YOUR DAMN MUCUS PLUG.

975
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,019
- I'’M NOT SHOWING YOU
WHAT'’S COMING OUT OF ME!

976
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:09,986
- OH, MY GOD, WE'’RE BOTH GIRLS.

977
00:37:09,986 --> 00:37:10,987
GET OVER IT.

978
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:12,126
IS SHE HAVING A BABY?

979
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:13,507
DID THE BABY FALL OUT?

980
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:14,922
WHAT'’S GOING ON?

981
00:37:14,922 --> 00:37:18,512
- I'’M NOT SHOWING YOU
A BOOGER RAG.

982
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:20,514
THERE ARE SOME THINGS
FRIENDS SHOULD NOT SHARE,

983
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:23,310
AND ONE OF THEM IS
MY MUCUS PLUG.

984
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:24,621
YEAH.

985
00:37:24,621 --> 00:37:25,829
NOW I GOT TO GET HOME

986
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:26,830
'’CAUSE I GOT TO CHANGE
MY UNDERWEAR.

987
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:33,181
BABE?
- I'’M IN HERE.

988
00:37:33,181 --> 00:37:35,322
BE QUIET.
THE BABY'’S SLEEPING.

989
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:36,944
- [gasps] OH, MY GOD.

990
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:38,186
- THE BABY'’S SLEEPING.

991
00:37:38,186 --> 00:37:39,326
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

992
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:41,535
- THE BABY'’S SLEEPING.
BE QUIET.

993
00:37:41,535 --> 00:37:45,124
♪ HUSH, LITTLE BABY,
DON'’T YOU CRY ♪

994
00:37:45,124 --> 00:37:47,748
- OF COURSE,
ROGER'’S CRADLING JIONNI.

995
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:49,336
- THEY'’RE SO WEIRD.
- THEY REALLY ARE.

996
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:50,337
- THEY DID IT.

997
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:51,407
- WE DID IT.

998
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:52,925
HE'’S A BIG BABY.

999
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:54,202
- GOOD JOB, GUYS.

1000
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:55,756
I THINK JENNI'’S PLUG
JUST FELL OUT.

1001
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:57,758
SHE RAN TO THE BATHROOM.
SOMETHING LEAKED OUT.

1002
00:37:57,758 --> 00:37:59,898
- I WAS GETTING OUT THE DOOR.

1003
00:37:59,898 --> 00:38:03,004
WE WERE WALKING OUT, AND IT JUST
FELT LIKE A HOT, WARM FEELING.

1004
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:04,143
- THAT'’S LIKE THE THIRD TIME
THAT'’S HAPPENED.

1005
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:05,662
- PACK YOUR BAGS.

1006
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:07,043
- SHE'’S GOING TO THE DOCTOR'’S
RIGHT NOW, THANK GOD.

1007
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:08,182
- I'’M GOING
TO THE DOCTOR'’S REGARDLESS.

1008
00:38:08,182 --> 00:38:09,701
I'’M GONNA CHANGE, ANYWAYS.

1009
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:10,771
- GOOD THING WE GOT THIS DONE.

1010
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:11,703
- YEAH.

1011
00:38:15,362 --> 00:38:17,087
SO I WAS JUST STANDING
AT THE DOOR TODAY,

1012
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,711
AND I JUST FELT, LIKE,
THIS WARM, GOOEY--

1013
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:21,575
AND I RAN INTO THE BATHROOM.

1014
00:38:21,575 --> 00:38:24,371
BUT I FELT IT, LIKE,
TWO OTHER TIMES AROUND ROGER.

1015
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:25,924
I WAS JUST LIKE,
"EW, WHAT IS THIS?"

1016
00:38:25,924 --> 00:38:27,235
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU BREAK YOUR WATER,

1017
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:28,513
IT'’S JUST GONNA CONTINUE.

1018
00:38:28,513 --> 00:38:30,031
- DID MINE ALREADY?

1019
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:31,516
- YOURS HAS NOT, NO.
- OKAY.

1020
00:38:31,516 --> 00:38:33,069
IT COULD MEAN
I COULD GO TOMORROW.

1021
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:35,520
IT COULD MEAN
I COULD GO IN A MONTH.

1022
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,935
YOU NEVER KNOW.
- ANY PROBLEMS, CALL ME.

1023
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:38,177
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1024
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:44,287
I'’LL PUT THESE UP ON TOP,
OR ON BOTTOM?

1025
00:38:44,287 --> 00:38:45,702
- BABE?
- WHAT?

1026
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:47,739
- DO YOU WANT TO CALL HER
AND SAY THE DOCTOR

1027
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:49,706
BROKE MY WATER BY ACCIDENT?

1028
00:38:49,706 --> 00:38:52,260
SO I WANTED TO TELL NICOLE
ABOUT OUR DOCTOR'’S APPOINTMENT,

1029
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,574
BUT I ALSO WANTED TO GET
HER BACK FOR PULLING A PRANK

1030
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:58,059
ON US SAYING THAT HER WATER
BROKE WHEN IT DIDN'’T.

1031
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:00,717
- NICOLE'’S WATER JUST BROKE!
WHAT DO WE DO?

1032
00:39:00,717 --> 00:39:02,305
ROGER, WHAT DO I DO?

1033
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,513
- HELP!

1034
00:39:03,513 --> 00:39:05,239
- YOU'’RE THE WORST [bleep] LIARS

1035
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,310
KNOWN IN THE HUMAN MANKIND.

1036
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,968
- YOU SHOULD PLAY IT OFF LIKE,

1037
00:39:09,968 --> 00:39:10,969
NOT A SENSE OF EMERGENCY.

1038
00:39:10,969 --> 00:39:12,177
IT'’LL MAKE IT MORE BELIEVABLE.

1039
00:39:12,177 --> 00:39:14,455
- SO I'’M GONNA TELL HER
THAT MY WATER BROKE.

1040
00:39:14,455 --> 00:39:15,594
- BUT WE'’RE JUST GONNA
BE A LITTLE BIT

1041
00:39:15,594 --> 00:39:16,975
MORE BELIEVABLE ABOUT IT.

1042
00:39:16,975 --> 00:39:19,426
- ACADEMY AWARD STATUS.

1043
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:21,911
[phone line trilling]

1044
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:24,569
- YOLO.
HOW WAS THE DOCTORS?

1045
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:26,847
- I'’M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

1046
00:39:26,847 --> 00:39:28,780
MY WATER DID BREAK.

1047
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,264
- I TOLD YOU!

1048
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:32,335
JIONNI, HER WATER BROKE!

1049
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:35,338
OH, MY GOD, I'’M CRYING.

1050
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:38,099
SHE'’S GONNA HAVE A BABY!

1051
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,448
- [softly]
NOW I FEEL BAD.

1052
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:43,795
- WHEN?
- I DON'’T KNOW.

1053
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:45,486
- CAN YOU STOP CRYING?
SHE'’S NOT EVEN CRYING.

1054
00:39:45,486 --> 00:39:47,730
- I'’M VERY EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOW.

1055
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:49,283
- WE'’RE GETTING OUR BAGS
INTO THE CAR,

1056
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:51,147
AND THEN WE'’RE GONNA HEAD
TO THE HOSPITAL.

1057
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:53,839
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

1058
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,739
- NOTHING,
'’CAUSE I'’M AN ASS[bleep].

1059
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:58,188
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- SHE'’S LYING.

1060
00:39:58,188 --> 00:40:00,984
- YOU'’RE LYING?
- OH, MY GOD.

1061
00:40:00,984 --> 00:40:03,193
- NOW I FEEL BAD
'’CAUSE YOU CRIED.

1062
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:05,782
- I'’M CRYING.

1063
00:40:05,782 --> 00:40:08,475
I HAD MY UGLY CRY FACE ON
AND EVERYTHING.

1064
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:09,959
- CAN I SEE IT?
- NO.

1065
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,029
IT WAS LIKE--

1066
00:40:11,029 --> 00:40:13,756
[laughter]

1067
00:40:13,756 --> 00:40:16,068
- I HAD TO GET YOU BACK
FOR [bleep] DOING IT TO ME.

1068
00:40:16,068 --> 00:40:18,105
- YOU'’RE AN ASS[bleep].
I JUST RUINED MY MAKEUP.

1069
00:40:18,105 --> 00:40:19,831
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

1070
00:40:19,831 --> 00:40:21,039
- '’CAUSE I LOVE YOU.

1071
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:23,110
- WELL, I DON'’T LOVE YOU.

1072
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,112
WHO DOES THAT?

1073
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:27,286
YOU'’RE HONESTLY THE WORST FRIEND
I'’VE EVER HAD.

1074
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:29,530
- YOU DID IT TO US!

1075
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:33,085
ROGER TOLD ME
TO SAY IT THAT WAY TOO.

1076
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:34,535
- TYPICAL.
- YEAH.

1077
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:35,916
- THANKS FOR BEING A JERK

1078
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,676
AND SAYING YOU WENT INTO LABOR
AND MADE ME CRY.

1079
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:39,022
THAT'’S SO RUDE.

1080
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,334
- JUST '’CAUSE
WE DID IT BETTER THAN YOU.

1081
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:42,474
- BYE.
- BYE, NOW.

1082
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:45,028
HIGH FIVE FOR ACTUALLY
MAKING IT BELIEVABLE.

1083
00:40:47,168 --> 00:40:48,204
- OH [bleep].

1084
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:49,516
- NEXT TIME ON SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW...

1085
00:40:49,516 --> 00:40:51,863
YAY!
YOU SMELL LIKE BALLS.

1086
00:40:51,863 --> 00:40:54,452
[laughter]

1087
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,281
- MY DAUGHTER'’S
COMING IN MINUTES.

1088
00:40:56,281 --> 00:40:57,282
MY DOCTOR'’S NOT HERE,

1089
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:58,801
AND I AM JUST IN THE--

1090
00:40:58,801 --> 00:41:00,906
THE WORST PAIN
I'’VE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE.

1091
00:41:00,906 --> 00:41:02,908
- YOU'’RE DILATING VERY RAPIDLY.

1092
00:41:02,908 --> 00:41:04,185
- I'’M SCARED.

1093
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:05,980
OH, MY GOD,
I THINK MY WATER JUST BROKE.
