00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,259
- BUONGIORNO.

180
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,744
- DO YOU MEAN BON APPETIT?

181
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:32,021
- BUONGIORNO?

182
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:35,473
[laughter]

183
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:38,579
ROGER, YOU'’RE FUNNY.

184
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:39,994
IT'’S OUR LAST SUPPER.

185
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:41,099
- THIS IS IT, GUYS.

186
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:42,445
- I WAS TELLING HIM EARLIER,

187
00:05:42,445 --> 00:05:44,033
I WOULD REALLY LIKE IT
IF WE COULD SPEND THE NIGHT,

188
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,931
ESPECIALLY WHEN GIOVANNA'’S
FIRST BORN,

189
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:47,347
FOR--IF YOU GUYS NEED ANY--

190
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,486
- I WOULD LOVE THAT.

191
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:49,797
- ON A PERSONAL NOTE,
I GOT TO SAY, MAN,

192
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:51,351
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

193
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,353
I FEEL LIKE THIS SUMMER
I GOT TO KNOW YOU BETTER

194
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,423
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL

195
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:56,425
THAN MAYBE ALL THE SUMMERS
IN THE PAST,

196
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:58,185
JUST BECAUSE WE'’RE DADS NOW,

197
00:05:58,185 --> 00:06:00,532
AND YOU WERE SO HELPFUL TO ME,

198
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:02,258
AND I'’M VERY APPRECIATIVE
OF THAT.

199
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:03,432
THANK YOU.

200
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:04,847
- NOT BECAUSE YOU DRY-HUMPED ME
[...] BUTT?

201
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:05,951
- WELL, THAT--

202
00:06:05,951 --> 00:06:07,090
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, THAT CERTAINLY

203
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:08,782
HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT TOO.

204
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:10,646
- WHAT A SUMMER.

205
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,855
- ARE YOU GONNA MOVE
RIGHT INTO YOUR NEW HOUSE?

206
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:16,514
- UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE TO MOVE
BACK TO THE BASEMENT.

207
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:18,826
- IT'’S ONLY GONNA BE
A WEEK OR TWO.

208
00:06:18,826 --> 00:06:20,380
- JUST UNTIL--
I MEAN, I GET IT.

209
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,484
- WE MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK

210
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:22,968
AND ENJOY THE HELP
OF MY MOTHER THERE.

211
00:06:22,968 --> 00:06:24,038
- YEAH, TRUE.

212
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:25,592
- YEAH, THE LAST HURRAH
IN THE BASEMENT.

213
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:27,387
- I COULD USE JANIS'’S HELP
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

214
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,629
- YUP.
- YEAH.

215
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:30,148
- WHAT'’S LORENZO'’S ROOM
LOOK LIKE?

216
00:06:30,148 --> 00:06:31,805
- LORENZO, WHAT COLOR
IS YOUR ROOM?

217
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:32,806
- BLUE.

218
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:33,876
- YAY!

219
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:35,567
DIDN'’T EVEN TELL HIM.

220
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:36,913
DIDN'’T EVEN TELL YOU.

221
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:37,983
[laughter]

222
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:39,537
HE'’S SO SMART.

223
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:40,676
- WE GOT TO GET GOING SOON,

224
00:06:40,676 --> 00:06:41,987
'’CAUSE WE GOT TO LEAVE TONIGHT.

225
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:44,611
ALL AROUND,
IT WAS AN AWESOME SUMMER,

226
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:47,510
BUT NOW IT'’S TIME
TO GO BACK TO THE BASEMENT.

227
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,891
- KISS.

228
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:49,892
- MWAH.

229
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:50,927
all: AW!

230
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:51,963
- THANK YOU.

231
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:53,896
- IT'’S HER FIRST BOYFRIEND.

232
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,899
- THE SUMMER WAS DEFINITELY
EVERYTHING THAT I HOPED FOR.

233
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:59,419
IT WAS FRICKIN'’ AWESOME TO BE
PREGNANT WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

234
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,179
NOW SHE'’S A MOM,
AND WE'’RE BOTH MOMS,

235
00:07:01,179 --> 00:07:03,630
AND, YOU KNOW, I'’M GLAD
THAT WE EXPERIENCED THAT.

236
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,218
- I'’M SUPER SAD THAT NICOLE
WON'’T BE MY NEIGHBOR ANYMORE,

237
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:08,220
YOU KNOW,
JUST HELPING ME BE A NEW MOM

238
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,463
IN EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

239
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,845
I COULDN'’T APPRECIATE THAT MORE
FROM HER.

240
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:14,572
AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT
TO HELP HER NOW WITH HER WEDDING

241
00:07:14,572 --> 00:07:15,918
AND GIOVANNA.

242
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,057
- THAT'’S WHAT BEST FRIENDS DO.

243
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:18,058
- MM-HMM.

244
00:07:18,058 --> 00:07:19,128
- LOVE YOU.

245
00:07:19,128 --> 00:07:20,509
- IT'’S NOT GOOD-BYE.

246
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:21,820
IT'’S, "I'’LL SEE YOU LATER."

247
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,753
- SAYONARA.

248
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:25,134
- BYE.
- BYE, MEILANI.

249
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:27,412
- BYE, TAKE CARE.
- I LOVE YOU.

250
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,449
- LOVE YOU.
- DRIVE SAFE.

251
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,864
- CALL US IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

252
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:32,210
- I WILL; PLEASE DRIVE SAFE.

253
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,453
- COME OVER!

254
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,144
- IF WE GET DIRTBAG NEIGHBORS
THAT MOVE IN,

255
00:07:35,144 --> 00:07:36,145
YOU'’RE COMING BACK.

256
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:38,009
- YOU GOT IT.

257
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,907
- LOVE YOU.
- BYE, MEILANI!

258
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:42,047
- BYE, MEILANI!

259
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:44,015
SAY, "BYE."

260
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:46,155
- OH, LORENZO.

261
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:48,191
- BACK IN THE BASEMENT.

262
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:58,443
- GOOD MORNING.

263
00:07:58,443 --> 00:07:59,617
- DA-DA.

264
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:01,964
- WHO'’S PUMPED TO GO
TO THE NEW HOUSE?

265
00:08:01,964 --> 00:08:03,275
- ME!

266
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,794
TODAY WE'’RE HEADING
OVER TO THE HOUSE,

267
00:08:04,794 --> 00:08:06,969
YOU KNOW,
TRYING TO PUT FURNITURE IN

268
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:08,833
AND DECORATE AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

269
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,593
WE CAN'’T REALLY MOVE
INTO THE HOUSE,

270
00:08:10,593 --> 00:08:12,388
SO IT'’S KIND OF LIKE A TEASE.

271
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:14,494
- GIVE ME A HUG.

272
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,495
- YOUR BREATH SMELLS.

273
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,496
GO BRUSH YOUR TEETH.

274
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,118
- WHO?
- YOU.

275
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:19,257
- YOURBREATH SMELLS.

276
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:21,604
- NO.

277
00:08:21,604 --> 00:08:22,605
[blowing]

278
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,296
- AH!

279
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:25,643
YOU HAVE, LIKE, SUPER POWERS.

280
00:08:25,643 --> 00:08:27,230
- [giggles]

281
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:33,374
- HI, BABY.

282
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:35,549
GONNA HANG OUT
WITH YOUR DADDY TODAY?

283
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,620
- I'’M GETTING
MY HAIR DONE TODAY.

284
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,070
- GETTING YOUR HAIR DID?

285
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,312
- YEAH, I'’M EXCITED.

286
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,693
I DEFINITELY WANT
A MOMMY MAKEOVER

287
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:43,108
AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE.

288
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:45,283
I MEAN, LIKE, I JUST DON'’T LIKE
THE WAY I LOOK RIGHT NOW.

289
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:47,285
I WAS PREGNANT FOR TEN MONTHS.

290
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:48,389
MY HAIR'’S ALWAYS UP.

291
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:49,529
I HAVEN'’T SHOWERED.

292
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,082
LIKE, I DON'’T DO MY MAKEUP.

293
00:08:51,082 --> 00:08:53,429
IT'’S LIKE, SHOULD I TAKE
THE HOUR AND A HALF, TWO HOURS

294
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:54,637
TO SHOWER, SHAVE?

295
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:56,259
OR DO I WANT TO [...] IN BED

296
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:58,054
AND HAVE THE EXTRA TWO HOURS
AND SLEEP?

297
00:08:58,054 --> 00:08:59,504
- "DO I WANT TO GET IN BED
WITH MY FIANCEE

298
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:00,954
WITH MY WINTER BUSH?"

299
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:02,611
- [laughs]
YOU SEE?

300
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,648
- FULL PELT.

301
00:09:05,648 --> 00:09:07,685
- BUT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I WANT
TO CHANGE A LITTLE BIT?

302
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:08,686
- YEAH.

303
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:09,963
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

304
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:12,103
YOU KNOW ME; I ALWAYS ENCOURAGE
YOU TO DO WHAT YOU WANT.

305
00:09:12,103 --> 00:09:13,794
- DO YOU LIKE BLONDES, REDHEADS?

306
00:09:13,794 --> 00:09:15,520
PURPLE HAIR, BLUE?

307
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,486
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

308
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:18,074
- I'’M DEBATING.

309
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:20,939
- YOU ALREADY KNOW
MY PREFERENCE IS BRUNETTE.

310
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:22,216
BUT...

311
00:09:22,216 --> 00:09:23,459
- THINKING...

312
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,530
I'’M THINKING BLONDE-ISH.

313
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:28,844
WE'’LL SEE.

314
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:30,052
I DON'’T CARE WHAT ROGER THINKS.

315
00:09:30,052 --> 00:09:31,363
I JUST WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

316
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,882
AND IT'’S NOT GONNA BE FOREVER.

317
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:34,504
I JUST WANT SOMETHING LIKE,

318
00:09:34,504 --> 00:09:36,092
"OH, SHE LOOKS GREAT
AS A NEW MOM.

319
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,093
SOMETHING'’S DIFFERENT."

320
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,198
LIKE, I WANT THAT REACTION.

321
00:09:38,198 --> 00:09:41,304
I WANT, LIKE,
"OH, YOU LOOK FRESH."

322
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:42,961
"YOU LOOK CLEAN."

323
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:46,724
- I COULD JUST GO TO THE STORE
AND GET YOU SOME SUMMER'’S EVE.

324
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:48,277
COME HOME A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT GIRL?

325
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:49,519
- YEAH.

326
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,659
- STRANGER'’S GONNA WALK
BACK INTO MY HOUSE?

327
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:51,901
- YEAH.

328
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:53,316
- SHE GONNA BE MORE SEXUAL
THAN THE OTHER ONE?

329
00:09:53,316 --> 00:09:54,835
- NO, BUT I'’LL LOOK MORE SEXUAL.

330
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:56,250
- IF I PLAY MY CARDS RIGHT

331
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,458
AND TREAT YOU
TO A REALLY NICE DINNER,

332
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,253
WILL YOU HAVE SEX WITH ME
WHEN WE GET HOME?

333
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:00,600
- UM...

334
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:03,879
- IS THAT A YES OR NO?

335
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,158
- THINK ABOUT IT.

336
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:09,022
- ACCORDING TO YOU,
I'’M NOT ROMANTIC ENOUGH,

337
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:11,058
AND THAT'’S WHY YOU DON'’T
GIVE ME ANY.

338
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:13,129
SO WOULDN'’T ROMANCE
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT?

339
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,199
- ROMANCE WOULD,

340
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:17,237
NOT NECESSARILY
A PLATE FULL OF FOOD.

341
00:10:17,237 --> 00:10:20,136
- WHAT CONSTITUTES ROMANCE?

342
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:23,208
- HUGS, KISSES, A CARD.

343
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,520
OH, MY GOD.

344
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:29,007
AH!
THAT TICKLES.

345
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,008
- [whistles]

346
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:32,666
- SEE?
THIS IS WHAT I GET.

347
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,530
- WELL, HOW IS THAT
SUCH A TOUGH DECISION FOR YOU?

348
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,152
- '’CAUSE WE HAVE A BABY.

349
00:10:36,152 --> 00:10:38,430
WHEN WE'’VE TRIED IT BEFORE AND
SHE'’S WOKEN UP IN THE MIDDLE,

350
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,811
THAT RUINS THE MOOD.

351
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:42,055
MEILANI HAS ACTUALLY
KILLED THE MOOD A FEW TIMES

352
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:43,953
DURING OUR SEXUAL ENDEAVORS,

353
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:47,439
WHEN, IN THE MIDDLE,
ROGER HEARS HER FUSSING,

354
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,028
STOPS AND GOES TO CHECK ON HER.

355
00:10:50,028 --> 00:10:53,169
DON'’T ACT LIKE IT DIDN'’T HAPPEN,
'’CAUSE YOU KNOW IT DID.

356
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:56,517
- IT DID, BUT YOU MAKE IT SOUND
SO PERVERSE, BUT YES.

357
00:10:56,517 --> 00:10:57,553
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN PERVERSE?

358
00:10:57,553 --> 00:10:58,899
IT JUST KILLS THE MOOD.

359
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:00,694
- I DIDN'’T WALK OVER THERE
WITH A GIANT BONER.

360
00:11:00,694 --> 00:11:04,077
I PUT MY UNDERWEAR ON
AND CLEANED MY HANDS OFF.

361
00:11:04,077 --> 00:11:05,423
- WHO THINKS LIKE THAT?

362
00:11:05,423 --> 00:11:08,253
- YOU SAID IT LIKE THAT.

363
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:11,429
ALL RIGHT, BREAKFAST WAS GOOD.

364
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:13,189
I'’M GONNA GO PICK UP
MY LITTLE BABY OVER THERE

365
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:15,675
THAT I SEE IS AWAKE
AND SNEEZING LIKE A CHAMP.

366
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,090
AND I'’M GONNA WAIT
FOR YOU TO GET HOME

367
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:19,264
AND MAKE SWEET, SWEET LOVE
TO MY BLONDE MISTRESS.

368
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:20,472
- UGH.

369
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:21,922
WE'’RE GONNA HAVE TO HURRY,
THOUGH,

370
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:23,613
'’CAUSE THEN MY FIANCEE
WILL BE HOME AFTER THAT.

371
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:25,926
- SO STUPID.

372
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:27,203
- HOLD ON.

373
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:29,033
WHOA.

374
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,759
WHOA!

375
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,071
HOME, SWEET HOME.

376
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:37,041
OOH, OUR POD!

377
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,628
TODAY WE'’RE HEADING
OVER TO THE HOUSE

378
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:40,872
BECAUSE WE'’RE GONNA START
TO MOVE FURNITURE IN.

379
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:43,185
THERE WE GO.

380
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:45,981
RIGHT NOW IT'’S BASICALLY
AN EMPTY HOUSE,

381
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:49,156
SO I'’M JUST REALLY EXCITED
TO MOVE STUFF IN

382
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:51,676
AND CHANGE THINGS AROUND.

383
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:54,299
- AH, THIS IS NICE STUFF.

384
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,438
WHERE DOES THIS GO?

385
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:56,543
- WE CAN PUT THAT IN THE CHINA.

386
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,613
CAN YOU GET THAT OUT FOR ME?

387
00:11:57,613 --> 00:11:59,926
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY CHINA
IS CALLED CHINA.

388
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:02,100
MAYBE THE CHINESE MADE IT UP.

389
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,723
PRETTY, RIGHT?

390
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,172
- THIS IS JUST FOR DECORATION?

391
00:12:05,172 --> 00:12:06,553
- YEAH.

392
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:08,279
HAS TO BE SOMETHING
WITH CHINESE PEOPLE,

393
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,832
'’CAUSE THEY'’RE REALLY SMART.

394
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:11,178
- CAN YOU BRING MY CUP IN?

395
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:12,386
- YEAH.

396
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:16,183
[gasps]

397
00:12:16,183 --> 00:12:18,323
DOOR!

398
00:12:18,323 --> 00:12:21,533
JIONNI!

399
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,534
- WHAT?

400
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,088
- I JUST SPILLED
ALL YOUR COFFEE.

401
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,021
- [sighs]

402
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,850
DON'’T GET MARRIED, MARCO.

403
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,852
- [laughs]

404
00:12:29,852 --> 00:12:31,405
- YOU TOLD ME
TO GET YOUR COFFEE.

405
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:32,682
I SPILLED IT EVERYWHERE.

406
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:34,546
- I JUST TOLD YOU
TO GET THE COFFEE, NOT THE BOX.

407
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,686
- I WANTED TO BRING
THE BOX IN.

408
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:38,896
OH, MY GOD.

409
00:12:38,896 --> 00:12:40,173
I JUST RUINED THE LAWN.

410
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,037
- I ASKED YOU TO DO ONE THING.

411
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:43,555
I'’M SUPPOSED TO CARRY STUFF.

412
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,488
- CARRY YOUR OWN DAMN COFFEE.

413
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:46,835
- I'’M CARRYING THE BOXES.

414
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,319
- SO AM I.

415
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:50,770
- APPARENTLY NOT.

416
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,219
- HERE, YOU GOT A SIP LEFT.

417
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,842
- I DON'’T WANT IT.

418
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:55,257
- I'’M JUST REALLY CLUMSY TODAY.

419
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:58,812
JESUS.

420
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,124
OH!

421
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:01,470
[laughing]

422
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,436
- WHAT'’S WRONG WITH YOU?

423
00:13:02,436 --> 00:13:03,644
- I JUST HIT MY CHIN.

424
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:05,232
- ON WHAT?

425
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:07,027
- WITH THE PLATE.

426
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:09,547
- ALL RIGHT, WHY DON'’T YOU
JUST SIT DOWN FOR A LITTLE BIT?

427
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:12,101
- OW!

428
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:14,138
I THINK THE WHOLE PROCESS
OF MOVING IS STRESSING ME OUT.

429
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,968
IT'’S JUST HARDER THAN I THOUGHT
IT WAS GOING TO BE.

430
00:13:16,968 --> 00:13:18,487
IT SUCKS.

431
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:21,283
OH, MY VAGINA HURTS.

432
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:28,083
- I NO LONGER WANT TO BE BROWN.

433
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,291
- OKAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

434
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,810
- BLONDE-ISH.

435
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,915
- "BLONDES HAVE MORE FUN"
MAKEOVER KIND OF THING?

436
00:13:32,915 --> 00:13:34,986
- YEAH, I'’M GONNA HAVE
A MOMMY MAKEOVER.

437
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:36,608
MAKE ME LOOK FAKE SEXY,
LIKE ROGER SAYS,

438
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:37,747
'’CAUSE I DO NOTHING FOR HIM.

439
00:13:37,747 --> 00:13:39,025
FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.

440
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:40,026
- OKAY.

441
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:41,372
SO YOU GUYS CAN ROLE PLAY LATER.

442
00:13:41,372 --> 00:13:42,304
- EW.

443
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:47,033
- OKAY, READY?

444
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:49,242
- I REALLY NEVER EVEN LIKED
BLONDE WOMEN,

445
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:51,416
BUT ROGER'’S NOT INTO BLONDES,

446
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,177
SO HOPEFULLY
IF I DYE MY HAIR BLONDE,

447
00:13:53,177 --> 00:13:55,800
HE WON'’T BE INTO ME
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS,

448
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,319
SO I CAN CONTINUE TO HEAL.

449
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:58,872
I JUST WANT TO LOOK HOT;
LEAVE ME ALONE.

450
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,635
- READY?

451
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,154
SURPRISE!

452
00:14:05,154 --> 00:14:06,984
- I LOOK DIFFERENT.

453
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:08,192
- LOVE IT?

454
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:10,780
- I LOOK LIKE I BELONG
BACK UPSTATE NEW YORK.

455
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,989
I FEEL PRETTY.

456
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:14,094
[laughter]

457
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:15,682
I LOVE IT.

458
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:17,270
I FEEL LIKE A NEW WOMAN.

459
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,927
I'’M OBSESSED WITH MY NEW HAIR.

460
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:20,721
I FEEL DIFFERENT;
THAT'’S THE THING.

461
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:22,931
I WANT TO FEEL DIFFERENT
THAN WHEN I WAS PREGNANT.

462
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:24,587
I DEFINITELY NEEDED
TO FIND MY SEXY BACK.

463
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:26,313
I REALLY JUST NEEDED IT.

464
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:27,556
LOVE YOU GUYS, THANK YOU.

465
00:14:27,556 --> 00:14:29,385
- LOVE YOU.

466
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:30,386
GO HAVE SEX.

467
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:31,387
- GO TO HELL.

468
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:33,389
[laughter]

469
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:39,223
- WHOO!

470
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:40,707
LET ME GET BACK THERE.

471
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:44,331
OW.

472
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,367
[grunting]

473
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:50,924
IT'’S MY BABY JESUS PAINTING.

474
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:53,133
I REALLY WANTED TO GET
A NICE JESUS PAINTING.

475
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:55,756
I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'’S IMPORTANT
TO HAVE SOMETHING JESUS

476
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:57,206
IN YOUR HOUSE.

477
00:14:57,206 --> 00:14:58,932
I WONDER WHERE I SHOULD HANG
BABY JESUS.

478
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,176
IN THE FOYER?

479
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:02,902
I SHOULD BE
AN INTERIOR DESIGNER.

480
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:09,080
WHY DON'’T YOU COME IN,
TAKE A BREAK.

481
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,668
GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

482
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:11,669
OKAY.

483
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:17,433
BABY JESUS.

484
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:18,883
- OH, MY GOD.

485
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:20,022
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

486
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:21,023
WHAT IS THIS?

487
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:22,197
- IT'’S BABY JESUS.

488
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:23,508
- THIS ISN'’T SAINT ROSE.

489
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:24,854
PUT IT AWAY.

490
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:26,546
- JIONNI, IT'’S BLESSING
OUR BABIES.

491
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:27,857
- OH, MY GOD.

492
00:15:27,857 --> 00:15:29,135
YOU'’RE LIKE THE ANTICHRIST.

493
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:30,999
YOU CAN'’T HAVE A PICTURE
OF JESUS IN OUR HOUSE.

494
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:33,070
- I AM NOT THE ANTICHRIST.

495
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,243
- WHERE YOU GONNA PUT THAT?

496
00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:35,693
I'’M EMBARRASSED TO HANG THAT.

497
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:37,177
- ME AND JIONNI
HAVE TO COMPROMISE

498
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:38,696
ON WHERE WE'’RE GONNA
HANG THIS BABY JESUS,

499
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:39,731
BUT I WOULD LOVE...

500
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,732
- IN THE BEDROOM.

501
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:41,768
- TO HAVE BABY JESUS SOMEWHERE.

502
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:42,769
- I WOULD LIKE IT
IN THE BEDROOM.

503
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:44,944
WHAT'’S WRONG WITH THE BEDROOM?

504
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,980
- I WANT OUR GUESTS TO SEE IT.

505
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,294
- WELL, WHAT IF
SOMEONE'’S JEWISH?

506
00:15:50,294 --> 00:15:51,364
- THIS IS MY HOUSE.

507
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:52,779
I'’M NOT DECORATING FOR THEM.

508
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,539
- NO JEWISH PEOPLE ALLOWED.

509
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:56,093
- THAT'’S NOT NICE.

510
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:57,197
- JUST KIDDING.

511
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:59,130
- [laughing] THAT'’S NOT NICE.

512
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,821
- ARE YOU--OH, MY GOD.

513
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:01,822
- JESUS IS BORN.

514
00:16:01,822 --> 00:16:05,171
DID YOU EVER SEE...CHRISTMAS?

515
00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:06,172
- CHRISTMAS?

516
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,759
- THIS IS THE CHRISTMAS PHOTO.

517
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,933
- YOU'’RE SICK.

518
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:11,039
I LIKE PICTURES
OF JESUS AND GOD.

519
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,283
I JUST DON'’T WANT IT
IN MY LIVING ROOM AND FOYER.

520
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:16,113
IT'’S A BIG--
WITH SHEEP AND STUFF.

521
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:18,218
- THERE'’S ONE SHEEP.

522
00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:19,219
- IT DOESN'’T MATTER.

523
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:20,807
- AND A DONKEY.

524
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:21,877
- I DIDN'’T SEE A DONKEY.

525
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:23,223
- THERE'’S A DONKEY.

526
00:16:23,223 --> 00:16:24,742
THERE SHOULD BE A DONKEY.

527
00:16:24,742 --> 00:16:26,571
- I JUST DON'’T WANT IT
IN MY LIVING ROOM

528
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:30,679
WHILE I'’M WATCHING TV AND SEEING
A BIG PICTURE OF CHRIST.

529
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:31,852
- JESUS.

530
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:34,786
CHRIST IS THE FATHER.

531
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,202
WAIT, JESUS CHRIST.

532
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:37,789
WAIT.

533
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,791
- YOU GOT A PAINTING;
YOU DON'’T EVEN KNOW WHO'’S WHO.

534
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,517
- IT'’S JESUS.

535
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,140
- YOU WANT THE HOLY WATER
IN THE FRONT TOO?

536
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,418
- I WAS THINKING WE COULD
PUT IT SOMEWHERE IN HERE.

537
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:46,729
WAIT, I'’M TALKING.

538
00:16:46,729 --> 00:16:48,904
BABE.

539
00:16:48,904 --> 00:16:50,802
BABE, I'’M TALKING.

540
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,666
BABE.

541
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:08,061
- IT'’S NOT EASY BEING A BABY.

542
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,821
GOT TO POOP ALL DAY.

543
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,030
[baby sneezes]

544
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,341
- OOH, GOD, I GOT IT
RIGHT IN MY EYE BALL.

545
00:17:12,341 --> 00:17:13,584
GOOD ONE, GOOD ONE.

546
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:14,757
- HELLO?

547
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:16,138
- OH, MOMMY'’S HERE.

548
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:18,761
- HELLO?

549
00:17:18,761 --> 00:17:20,073
- HELLO.

550
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,006
BABY, WHO IS THAT?

551
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:23,214
- HOW DO I LOOK?

552
00:17:23,214 --> 00:17:25,044
- WHO'’S THIS STRANGE LADY
IN OUR HOUSE?

553
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,494
WHO ARE YOU?

554
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:29,082
MY HOPE IS, WITH THIS NEW LOOK,

555
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:31,533
IS THAT MAYBE IT'’S A WHOLE NEW
OUTLOOK ON EVERYTHING,

556
00:17:31,533 --> 00:17:33,638
MAYBE A NEW OUTLOOK
ON OUR SEX LIFE.

557
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:35,364
SO, WOW, WE'’LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

558
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:36,745
WHAT'’S YOUR NAME, LADY?

559
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:37,780
- SHUT UP.

560
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,265
- CAN YOU BE CASSANDRA?

561
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:41,025
- ROGER'’S TRYING TO SAY
THAT I'’M CASSANDRA RIGHT NOW

562
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:42,026
'’CAUSE I HAVE BLONDE HAIR,

563
00:17:42,026 --> 00:17:43,372
AND I DON'’T EVEN LIKE THAT NAME.

564
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:45,616
IT'’S LIKE A TYPICAL
WHITE GIRL NAME.

565
00:17:45,616 --> 00:17:46,996
- OH, MY GOSH.

566
00:17:46,996 --> 00:17:48,481
IT'’S GONNA BE LIKE SLEEPING
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

567
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:49,723
- YEAH, BUT SAME RESULT.

568
00:17:49,723 --> 00:17:51,311
- NOTHING?
- NOTHING.

569
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:52,761
- NO?

570
00:17:52,761 --> 00:17:55,798
I THINK THERE GOES MY CHANCES
OF GETTING LUCKY AGAIN TONIGHT.

571
00:17:55,798 --> 00:17:58,939
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE WALKING
INTO A LAMBORGHINI STORE.

572
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:00,769
YOU'’RE WELCOME TO LOOK,
BUT DON'’T DARE TOUCH,

573
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:04,152
UNLESS YOU'’VE GOT THE FUNDS
TO BUY THAT RIDE.

574
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:05,463
AND CLEARLY I DON'’T.

575
00:18:05,463 --> 00:18:08,742
- I'’M HOT NOW.

576
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:10,227
- COUGAR STYLE.

577
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:12,608
- COUGAR?
THAT MEANS I'’M [...] OLD!

578
00:18:12,608 --> 00:18:14,023
- COUGAR'’S STILL COMPLIMENTARY.

579
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:15,335
IT WOULD JUST PUT YOU
IN A LITTLE BIT

580
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:16,509
OF A HIGHER AGE BRACKET;
THAT'’S ALL.

581
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:17,717
- 50, 60?

582
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:18,959
- YEAH.

583
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:20,444
SO YOU'’LL BE A COUGAR ONE DAY.

584
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:21,445
YOU'’RE JUST NOT THERE YET.

585
00:18:21,445 --> 00:18:22,549
- THANK YOU.

586
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,068
- YOUR MOTHER WOULD BE SO PISSED

587
00:18:24,068 --> 00:18:25,828
IF SHE KNEW I WAS LETTING
THIS LADY HOLD YOU.

588
00:18:25,828 --> 00:18:28,624
- EXCUSE--

589
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:29,867
- CASSANDRA,
I'’LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,

590
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,214
THE SEX LIFE
IS A LITTLE LACKING.

591
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:37,357
- DO YOU HEAR HOW HE'’S TALKING
ABOUT YOUR MOMMY?

592
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:38,910
- IT'’S TRUE.
BLONDES DO HAVE MORE FUN.

593
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,740
- SEE, BRUNETTES GET
THE JOB DONE, THOUGH.

594
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,500
- NO JOB STARTING
WITH A "B," THOUGH.

595
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,743
- YOU CAN'’T WIN WITH YOUR DAD.

596
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:44,951
- [laughs]

597
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:56,963
- SO THIS IS OUR FIRST
TIME OUT, WOMAN.

598
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,482
WE NEED TO BE PREPARED.

599
00:18:58,482 --> 00:19:00,242
MEILANI'’S GONNA COME
TO DINNER WITH US TONIGHT.

600
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:02,210
IT'’S OUR FIRST
FAMILY DINNER OUT.

601
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,073
IT'’S SUPER CUTE,
AND I'’M EXCITED.

602
00:19:04,073 --> 00:19:06,110
IF ANYONE, LIKE, SNICKERS
OR LOOKS AT ME,

603
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,560
I'’M GONNA BE LIKE,
"YOU ACT LIKE YOU'’VE NEVER SEEN

604
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,802
"A [...] CRYING BABY BEFORE.

605
00:19:08,802 --> 00:19:10,218
"LIKE, GET OVER YOUR [...] SELF.

606
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:11,564
"EAT YOUR [...] FOOD

607
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:13,152
"AND STOP LOOKING OVER HERE.

608
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,637
"LIKE, THIS [...] IS NATURAL.
IT HAPPENS, PEOPLE.

609
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:17,086
GET OVER IT."

610
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:18,571
- AND THIS IS WHY MY DAUGHTER
WOULD NEVER EMBARRASS ME,

611
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:20,020
BECAUSE MY FIANCEE
WILL EMBARRASS ME

612
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,746
THREE TIMES AS MUCH.

613
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:25,129
- HAND WIPES,
EXTRA BABY WIPES,

614
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:28,063
EXTRA OINTMENT,
SUNSCREEN.

615
00:19:28,063 --> 00:19:29,202
- WHAT DO YOU NEED THAT FOR?

616
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,272
- WE NEED EVERYTHING.

617
00:19:30,272 --> 00:19:31,722
I ALWAYS CARRY EVERYTHING.

618
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:36,313
FORMULA, TYLENOL INFANT,
NOSE-CLEANER.

619
00:19:36,313 --> 00:19:37,383
- GOOD GOD.

620
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:40,420
JENNI DEFINITELY
HAS OVERPREPARED.

621
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,353
WHEN YOU GO OUT NOW, IT'’S--

622
00:19:42,353 --> 00:19:44,873
YOU BRING A WHOLE CAR-LOAD
OF STUFF WITH YOU.

623
00:19:44,873 --> 00:19:46,944
- THERMOMETER, BRUSH.

624
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:48,394
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WE GOT EVERYTHING?

625
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:50,913
SHOULD I BRING AN EXTRA OUTFIT
OR TWO?

626
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:52,363
- YOU HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH,

627
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:54,538
AS ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE THE CASE.

628
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:56,954
- RATHER BE OVERPREPARED
THAN UNDERPREPARED.

629
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,859
- HOW AM I GONNA GET THIS
UP OVER THOSE STAIRS?

630
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:06,929
- I'’LL CARRY.

631
00:20:11,486 --> 00:20:13,660
IT'’S FUNNY AND CUTE
HOW MUCH THINGS HAVE CHANGED

632
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,179
SINCE, YOU KNOW,
WE'’VE BECOME PARENTS.

633
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,010
LIKE, 9:30 AT NIGHT
IS VERY LATE FOR US.

634
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,391
- MAY AS WELL BE 1:00 A.M.

635
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:21,634
- IT IS.

636
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:23,187
LIKE, IT'’S LIKE,
I FEEL JUST AS TIRED

637
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:24,809
AT 9:30 AT NIGHT
THAN I USED TO FEEL

638
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:26,052
AT 4:00 A.M. LEAVING THE CLUB

639
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:27,950
AND GOING TO GET
SOME, LIKE, CHEESE BALLS.

640
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,642
- CLUB IS NOW A SANDWICH FOR US.

641
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,195
- YEAH, NO JOKE.

642
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,441
HOW YOU GONNA GO
OUT TO DINNER WITH US

643
00:20:35,441 --> 00:20:36,442
AND PASS OUT?

644
00:20:36,442 --> 00:20:37,822
- NOT A VERY GOOD DINNER DATE.

645
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:39,376
- JUST WANT TO FEEL SEXY.

646
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:40,687
- YOU ARE.

647
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:41,688
I THINK YOU LOOK AMAZING.

648
00:20:41,688 --> 00:20:43,103
I THINK YOU BOUNCED RIGHT BACK.

649
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:45,313
- I'’M A LITTLE JIGGLY.

650
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:48,143
EVERYTHING ON ME,
FROM MY HEADS TO MY TOES,

651
00:20:48,143 --> 00:20:49,524
IS JIGGLY.

652
00:20:49,524 --> 00:20:51,042
- YOU DO IT FOR ME STILL,
BUT...

653
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,699
I'’M NOT SURE EXACTLY
WHAT YOU DO.

654
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:53,976
[laughs]

655
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:55,461
- I COULD BE BROKEN DOWN THERE.

656
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:57,221
- RIGHT, SO THE DOCTOR
SAYS SIX WEEKS.

657
00:20:57,221 --> 00:20:58,567
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE DOCTOR

658
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:01,950
SAID MANY PEOPLE ARE DOING IT,
YOU KNOW...

659
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,193
- BECAUSE THEY DIDN'’T CARE.

660
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:05,264
- OKAY.

661
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,334
THE DOCTOR ALSO SAID

662
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:07,990
YOU CAN'’T DRIVE FOR SIX WEEKS.

663
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:09,440
HOW MUCH DID YOU LISTEN TO THAT?

664
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,441
- I WAITED SIX HOURS.

665
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:11,580
- YEAH.

666
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,652
SO YOU USED YOUR ADVANTAGE
AND CONVENIENCE,

667
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:16,033
WHAT WORKS FOR YOU.

668
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:17,759
- DRIVING AND MY VAGINA
BEING STITCHED UP

669
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,794
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

670
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:19,899
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

671
00:21:19,899 --> 00:21:20,934
[bleep],
YOU WON'’T DIE FROM.

672
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:22,073
DRIVING, YOU WOULD.

673
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:24,110
- MY VAGINA
COULD HEMORRHAGE AND DIE.

674
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,905
- I'’VE BEEN HEMORRHAGING
YOUR VAGINA FOR YEARS,

675
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:28,666
AND YOU HAVEN'’T DIED YET.

676
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,944
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
FOR A GUY THAT HAS BEEN

677
00:21:30,944 --> 00:21:32,532
IN A RELATIONSHIP
FOR 4 1/2 YEARS

678
00:21:32,532 --> 00:21:34,707
AND GETS LAID AS MUCH AS I DO,

679
00:21:34,707 --> 00:21:36,950
THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION
OF MY LOVE FOR YOU.

680
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,089
- NO.

681
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,022
- HOWEVER, I DO TAKE
VERY LONG SHOWERS.

682
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:42,404
- STOP.

683
00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:43,302
GOD.

684
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:49,480
- MOST PEOPLE CALL, LIKE,
A MOVING COMPANY

685
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,481
WHEN THEY MOVE.

686
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:52,690
- [laughs]

687
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,244
- OH, MY GOD.

688
00:21:55,244 --> 00:21:56,660
ARE YOU KIDDING?

689
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,178
- [giggling]

690
00:21:58,178 --> 00:22:00,042
I THINK IT LOOKS
BEAUTIFUL THERE.

691
00:22:00,042 --> 00:22:03,494
WE HAVE TO FIND A HOME
FOR IT SOMEWHERE.

692
00:22:03,494 --> 00:22:06,428
- I'’M NOT PUTTING JESUS CHRIST
ON OUR WALLS.

693
00:22:06,428 --> 00:22:07,636
- WHY DO YOU SAY JESUS CHRIST?

694
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:09,017
HIS NAME'’S JESUS.

695
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:12,400
- I GET GOOSEBUMPS
EVERY TIME I LOOK AT JESUS.

696
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,435
- THAT'’S A GOOD THING.

697
00:22:13,435 --> 00:22:15,368
IT MEANS HE'’S CONNECTING
WITH YOU.

698
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:20,304
- NICOLE, NEXT WEEK,
TUESDAY AND THURSDAY,

699
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:21,512
WE CAN'’T BE IN HERE.

700
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:22,927
- WHY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

701
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:24,170
- FOR INSPECTIONS.

702
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,930
- OH, AND THEN WHAT?
WE CAN MOVE IN?

703
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,726
- THEN WE GET THE C.O.
AFTER THAT.

704
00:22:28,726 --> 00:22:31,211
- A C.O. IS A CERTIFICATE
OF "OPPOCANCY."

705
00:22:31,211 --> 00:22:33,041
[laughter]

706
00:22:33,041 --> 00:22:35,699
OCCUPANCY, OCCUPANCY.

707
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:36,734
- YES.

708
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:38,529
- OCCUPANCY.

709
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:39,530
- OCCUPANCY.

710
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,531
- SAY IT.

711
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:41,532
- THAT'’S A WEIRD WORD.

712
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:42,533
- START OVER, SAY IT.

713
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,914
- CERTIFICATION OF OCCUPANCY.

714
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:45,571
- A CERTIFICATE.

715
00:22:45,571 --> 00:22:48,056
A C.O. IS A CERTIFICATE
OF OCCUPANCY.

716
00:22:48,056 --> 00:22:49,057
YES!

717
00:22:49,057 --> 00:22:50,161
- NAILED IT.

718
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,335
- INSPECTION'’S NEXT WEEK.

719
00:22:51,335 --> 00:22:52,440
IF EVERYTHING GOES GOOD,

720
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,580
THE STATE GIVES US
THE FINAL PAPERWORK,

721
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,788
AND THEN YOU'’RE GOOD TO GO.

722
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:57,652
- TWO MORE WEEKS
IN THE BASEMENT.

723
00:22:57,652 --> 00:22:59,826
- NOW IT'’S IN
THE INSPECTOR'’S HANDS.

724
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:01,483
WE NEED A C.O.
TO MOVE IN THE HOUSE,

725
00:23:01,483 --> 00:23:03,243
AND IF YOU DON'’T HAVE THAT,
YOU CAN'’T MOVE IN,

726
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:05,211
NO MATTER HOW PERFECT IT LOOKS,

727
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:06,592
NO MATTER
IF THE WATER'’S RUNNING,

728
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:07,696
IF THE ELECTRIC'’S RUNNING.

729
00:23:07,696 --> 00:23:09,457
YOU NEED A C.O.
TO PASS INSPECTION

730
00:23:09,457 --> 00:23:11,113
AND TO MOVE IN YOUR HOUSE.

731
00:23:11,113 --> 00:23:12,321
ARE YOU WALKING AROUND
WITH THE GUY?

732
00:23:12,321 --> 00:23:13,771
- YEAH.

733
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:15,048
- GREAT.
- THANKS.

734
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:17,119
THE INSPECTOR WON'’T
INSPECT THE HOUSE

735
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:18,845
WITH THE BABY JESUS POSTER.

736
00:23:18,845 --> 00:23:20,053
HE'’S SACRELIGION.

737
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:21,123
- SACRILEGIOUS.

738
00:23:21,123 --> 00:23:22,228
- RELIGIOUS.

739
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:23,229
[laughter]

740
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:31,617
- HOW DOES SHE--HER WHOLE BODY
HAS TO GO THROUGH THAT?

741
00:23:31,617 --> 00:23:33,204
MY GOD.

742
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,689
THAT'’S WORK.

743
00:23:34,689 --> 00:23:37,174
OH, THIS IS NOT GONNA FIT.

744
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:38,175
- WHAT THE HELL?

745
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:39,694
- IT'’S TOO TIGHT.

746
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:42,455
- I FEEL LIKE MEILANI'’S JUST
GROWING LIKE A BEAST RIGHT NOW,

747
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,905
'’CAUSE LOOK AT HER FATHER.

748
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:45,009
HE'’S ENORMOUS.

749
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:47,426
WHAT KIND OF BABY DO I HAVE?

750
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,531
- DON'’T KNOW.

751
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:50,912
THE FARMER'’S MARKET DOWNTOWN,

752
00:23:50,912 --> 00:23:52,914
SEE IF THEY GOT SOME
BURLAP BAGS LEFTOVER.

753
00:23:52,914 --> 00:23:55,261
- OH, MY GOD.

754
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:57,090
WE SHOULD PACK FOR DEER RUN
TOO TONIGHT.

755
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,126
- OKAY.

756
00:23:58,126 --> 00:23:59,472
- WE'’RE GOING CAMPING

757
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:02,337
AT A PLACE I USED TO GO
EVERY SUMMER CALLED DEER RUN.

758
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:03,994
I'’M VERY EXCITED FOR TOMORROW,

759
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,168
BECAUSE I WANT ROGER AND MEILANI
TO EXPERIENCE

760
00:24:06,168 --> 00:24:07,653
A SMALL PIECE OF MY CHILDHOOD.

761
00:24:07,653 --> 00:24:10,207
IT'’S LIKE BARBECUE, FISHING,

762
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:11,622
THE CAMPING LIFE.

763
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:13,590
SO IT'’S REALLY BEEN
A TRADITION IN MY FAMILY,

764
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,799
AND I WOULD LOVE TO MAKE THIS
KIND OF PART

765
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,973
OF WHATEVER TRADITION
WE MAKE FOR OUR FAMILY.

766
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:19,319
- I CAN'’T WAIT.

767
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:21,460
I'’VE HEARD ABOUT DEER RUN
FOR YEARS NOW, YOU KNOW?

768
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,565
AND I CAN'’T WAIT
TO SEE WHAT IT'’S ALL ABOUT.

769
00:24:23,565 --> 00:24:26,050
- SEXY BLACK BOOTS,
THIGH-HIGHS.

770
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:29,606
- THIGH-HIGHS?
FOR WHAT?

771
00:24:29,606 --> 00:24:30,779
- IN CASE I NEED IT.

772
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:33,057
- WE'’RE GOING TO A CAMPGROUND.

773
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:34,473
- WHAT ABOUT FUR BOOTS?

774
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,923
- OH, GOD.

775
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:38,511
I DON'’T MIND ROUGHING IT
A LITTLE BIT.

776
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:41,031
- HE LIKES SLEEPING IN THE WOODS
NAKED ON A ROCK.

777
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:43,551
THAT'’S HIS DEFINITION
OF CAMPING.

778
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:45,760
- I SLEEP NEXT TO A ROCK
EVERY NIGHT.

779
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,866
- [laughs]
MOTHER-[...].

780
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:54,113
- 42 PAIRS OF SWEATPANTS
AND SOME GRANNY PANTIES.

781
00:24:54,113 --> 00:24:55,804
- NOW JEWELRY.

782
00:24:55,804 --> 00:24:57,012
- YOU'’RE GOING TO A CAMPGROUND.

783
00:24:57,012 --> 00:24:58,635
I DON'’T THINK YOU NEED
ANY JEWELRY.

784
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:01,983
- I'’M THINKING
KIND OF COUNTRY VINTAGE.

785
00:25:01,983 --> 00:25:03,674
- OH, GOD.

786
00:25:03,674 --> 00:25:06,539
- BABE, WHAT DO YOU THINK,
TOO MUCH?

787
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,817
- WE'’RE GOING TO A CAMPGROUND.

788
00:25:08,817 --> 00:25:10,094
YES.

789
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:11,268
SHOULD I BRING JEWELRY?

790
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:12,407
- MAYBE.

791
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:14,167
- I JUST DROPPED MY [...]
TO GET CLEANED,

792
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:15,375
SO I DON'’T KNOW
IF IT'’S DONE YET.

793
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:16,515
- HMM.

794
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,656
BRING, DID YOU--
YOU'’RE A--EW.

795
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:32,772
- WE GOT A BIG DAY
PLANNED TODAY.

796
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:36,362
WE'’RE GONNA GO SHOPPING
AND CAMPING.

797
00:25:36,362 --> 00:25:37,881
- YOU WANT TO GO SHOPPING
WITH DADDY

798
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:39,538
AND BUY STEAKS FOR YOURSELF?

799
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,056
- WE'’RE GONNA HAVE
TO GET YOU SOME TEETH

800
00:25:41,056 --> 00:25:43,162
SO YOU CAN EAT REAL FOOD.

801
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:44,784
MAYBE WE COULD TALK
TO AUNTIE NICOLE

802
00:25:44,784 --> 00:25:46,406
ABOUT WHERE TO GET
SOME CHOMPERS.

803
00:25:46,406 --> 00:25:48,098
- SO MEAN.

804
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:50,756
SO TODAY WE'’RE GOING CAMPING
AT DEER RUN,

805
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:52,481
SO I WOULD LIKE ROGER
TO GO TO LENNY'’S

806
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:54,794
TO PICK UP, YOU KNOW,
SOME ESSENTIAL GROCERIES

807
00:25:54,794 --> 00:25:56,071
AND BARBECUE STUFF.

808
00:25:56,071 --> 00:25:58,591
YOU KNOW, STEAKS, CHICKEN,
SHISH KABOBS,

809
00:25:58,591 --> 00:25:59,868
ALL THE WORKS.

810
00:25:59,868 --> 00:26:01,870
- WHEN I GET BACK,
IF YOU COULD HAVE EVERYTHING

811
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:04,079
LITERALLY READY TO PUT
IN THE CAR AND GO.

812
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,460
I'’M NOT GETTING THERE
AT MIDNIGHT.

813
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,461
THAT'’S ALL I'’M SAYING.

814
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:08,290
- WELL, I HAVE SOAP, FACE WASH.

815
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,121
WHAT DO YOU NEED, JUST DEODORANT
AND YOUR TOOTHBRUSH?

816
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:13,433
- YOU BROUGHT EVERYTHING
BUT A BALL GOWN.

817
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:15,090
- DON'’T KNOW IF I BROUGHT THAT.

818
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:18,611
I PACKED A LOT,
MORE THAN I SHOULD HAVE.

819
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:22,753
BUT I WANT TO LOOK FANCY
FOR CAMPING.

820
00:26:22,753 --> 00:26:24,237
HE'’LL APPRECIATE IT
LATER IN LIFE

821
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:25,618
WHEN I'’M STILL HOT.

822
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:27,896
- HOTNESS IS NO GOOD
UNLESS YOU USE IT

823
00:26:27,896 --> 00:26:30,899
FOR SOME SORT
OF SEXUALITY FEATURE.

824
00:26:30,899 --> 00:26:33,557
IT'’S LIKE HAVING A LAMBORGHINI
WITH NO MOTOR, YOU KNOW?

825
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:36,042
YOU LOOK GOOD IN A WINDOW,

826
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:38,424
BUT SUCK OUT ON THE OPEN ROAD.

827
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:40,219
- DO YOU HEAR HOW HE TALKS
ABOUT YOUR MOMMY?

828
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:41,461
- [chuckles]

829
00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:56,373
HEY, BABE.

830
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:57,788
WHAT IS IT?

831
00:26:57,788 --> 00:27:00,446
- HER BASSINETTE THAT GOES
TO HER ORBIT BABY STROLLER.

832
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:04,415
DO YOU WANT TO PACK MY CAR
OR PACK THE COOLER?

833
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:05,727
- REMEMBER WHEN I SAID,

834
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:07,867
"HAVE EVERYTHING READY
WHEN I GET BACK"?

835
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:10,939
- I JUST GOT--I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO GO OUT THERE.

836
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:15,047
- TRY TO GET
THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

837
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:16,945
- "REMEMBER WHEN I SAID...

838
00:27:16,945 --> 00:27:18,533
NAH-NAH-NAH-NAH-NAH."

839
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,742
I CAN TELL ROGER'’S AGITATED.

840
00:27:20,742 --> 00:27:23,158
I FEEL LIKE I HAD THE MAJORITY
OF THE STUFF READY FOR ROGER.

841
00:27:23,158 --> 00:27:24,746
I HAD IT ALL BY THE DOOR.

842
00:27:24,746 --> 00:27:27,059
CLEARLY THAT WASN'’T GOOD ENOUGH.

843
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,577
HI, BEAUTIFUL.

844
00:27:28,577 --> 00:27:31,097
HI, BEAUTIFUL, YEAH.

845
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:32,409
SHE'’S JUST SO...

846
00:27:32,409 --> 00:27:33,893
- I'’M IN A REAL HURRY HERE.

847
00:27:33,893 --> 00:27:35,412
DON'’T WORRY ABOUT ME.

848
00:27:35,412 --> 00:27:37,069
- YOU POOING?

849
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:38,415
NO.

850
00:27:38,415 --> 00:27:41,176
NOT AFTER THE POO YOU HAD TODAY.

851
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:43,109
- SO I'’M PRETTY ANNOYED
RIGHT NOW.

852
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:44,628
I LOADED THE ENTIRE CAR.

853
00:27:44,628 --> 00:27:47,079
I GET HOME, AND IT'’S LIKE
THERE'’S JUST THIS VERY RELAXED,

854
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,563
YOU KNOW,
"I'’M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT;

855
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:50,185
YOU'’LL GET EVERYTHING DONE,"
TYPE OF THING.

856
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:51,186
- ALL RIGHT, I'’M READY.

857
00:27:51,186 --> 00:27:52,187
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU.

858
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:53,188
- WAITING FOR ME?

859
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:54,258
I JUST LOADED THE WHOLE CAR.

860
00:27:54,258 --> 00:27:55,743
- I'’M NOT GOING
WITH THIS ATTITUDE.

861
00:27:55,743 --> 00:27:57,296
YOU DON'’T HAVE
TO GET ATTITUDE-Y.

862
00:27:57,296 --> 00:27:58,504
I WOULD HAVE HELPED YOU
IF YOU ASKED.

863
00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:00,368
- HOW ARE YOU WAITING ON ME?

864
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:01,783
THE CAR'’S DONE.

865
00:28:01,783 --> 00:28:03,233
I'’VE BEEN WAITING ON YOU
TO PUT THE BABY IN THERE.

866
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:04,337
- JUST THE STROLLER.

867
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:05,373
- YEAH, I'’LL GET IT.

868
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:06,374
- OKAY.

869
00:28:06,374 --> 00:28:07,547
THEN I'’M READY.

870
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:08,756
- I'’M FEELING
A LITTLE DISRESPECTED.

871
00:28:08,756 --> 00:28:10,550
I FEEL LIKE
WHAT I ASKED JENNI TO DO

872
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:12,483
WAS REALLY PRETTY MINISCULE.

873
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,623
WE ENDED UP LEAVING
ABOUT FOUR HOURS LATER.

874
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:16,418
IT'’S 6:00, AND WE'’RE
GETTING ON THE ROAD.

875
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:18,558
I'’M GONNA BE IN THE BACK SEAT
WITH MEILANI,

876
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:20,940
AND WE'’RE ALREADY
OFF TO A BAD START.

877
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,148
WE'’RE ALREADY ANNOYED.

878
00:28:22,148 --> 00:28:24,012
WE'’RE NOT STOPPING
ON THE WAY UP THERE.

879
00:28:26,152 --> 00:28:27,844
- TO GIVE SOMEONE 40 MINUTES
TO GET READY--

880
00:28:27,844 --> 00:28:29,155
- 40 MINUTES?

881
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:31,295
I WAS GONE FOR TWO HOURS
TO GO GET HE CAR AND BACK.

882
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:32,849
- THEY NEEDED A BREAK AT 5:30.

883
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:34,229
"WE'’RE NOT STOPPING,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."

884
00:28:34,229 --> 00:28:37,129
- ONLY REQUEST WAS WE GET
ON THE ROAD IN A TIMELY FASHION.

885
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:39,372
[overlapping arguments]

886
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:40,857
- AGREEMENT YOU MADE FOR US.

887
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:43,445
- THE IDEA WAS TO GET
ON THE ROAD AND GET MOVING.

888
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:44,550
- YEAH, BUT I DIDN'’T REALIZE...

889
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:46,552
- YOU'’RE JUST
LOLLY-DOLLYING ALONG...

890
00:28:46,552 --> 00:28:48,312
- STOP, SERIOUSLY.

891
00:28:48,312 --> 00:28:51,177
YOU JUST SOUND
LIKE SUCH AN ASS.

892
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:54,525
HI.

893
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,700
- HEY, LOOK WHO'’S HERE.

894
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,736
HOW ARE YOU?

895
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,221
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

896
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:01,532
- [sighs]

897
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:02,741
WE'’RE NOT GETTING ALONG.

898
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,673
I'’M JUST GONNA BE HONEST
AND LET YOU KNOW.

899
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:05,674
- OKAY.

900
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:06,848
- NOTHING ELSE IS NEW.

901
00:29:08,677 --> 00:29:11,128
- ALL RIGHT, SO LISTEN.

902
00:29:11,128 --> 00:29:13,027
LET'’S LET ALL THIS GO.

903
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:14,304
SHE'’S WHAT'’S IMPORTANT.

904
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:15,443
SHE'’S WHAT MATTERS.

905
00:29:15,443 --> 00:29:17,134
- IT'’S SO PETTY.
- IT IS PETTY.

906
00:29:17,134 --> 00:29:19,585
- AND WE GOT UP HERE
AT A REASONABLE HOUR.

907
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:22,001
- APOLOGIZE.

908
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:23,727
THE MAIN THING IS
THAT WE'’RE GOOD PARENTS.

909
00:29:23,727 --> 00:29:25,039
WE'’RE UP HERE.

910
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,281
LET'’S TRY TO ENJOY IT.

911
00:29:26,281 --> 00:29:27,455
TOMORROW'’S ANOTHER DAY.

912
00:29:27,455 --> 00:29:29,043
- FAIR ENOUGH.

913
00:29:29,043 --> 00:29:30,320
I DEFINITELY CAN SAY

914
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,080
THAT MEILANI HAS MADE US
BETTER PEOPLE

915
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,464
AND THAT WE'’RE BOTH TRYING
AS PARENTS AND IN A RELATIONSHIP

916
00:29:36,464 --> 00:29:37,948
TO JUST BE BETTER PEOPLE.

917
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:41,365
AND WE HAD MAJOR PRIDE AND EGO
ISSUES IN OUR RELATIONSHIP,

918
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:42,608
AND STUBBORNNESS,

919
00:29:42,608 --> 00:29:44,575
AND YOU REALLY CAN'’T HAVE THOSE
WITH A KID.

920
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:45,576
- YOU'’RE RIGHT.

921
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,577
NOW THAT WE'’RE PARENTS,

922
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:47,682
NOW THAT WE HAVE A CHILD,

923
00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:48,925
I CAN'’T DO THAT ANYMORE,
YOU KNOW?

924
00:29:48,925 --> 00:29:49,926
IT'’S SAD THAT WE STILL
HAVE THESE FIGHTS

925
00:29:49,926 --> 00:29:51,065
AND WE STILL DO THIS,

926
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:52,376
AND I WANT TO MAKE THIS
A GOOD WEEKEND.

927
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:53,688
YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY TOMORROW
WE WAKE UP

928
00:29:53,688 --> 00:29:55,138
REFRESHED AND FEELING GOOD,

929
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:56,864
AND I CAN SEE WHAT DEER RUN'’S
ALL ABOUT.

930
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,934
I LOVE YOU.

931
00:29:57,934 --> 00:29:59,038
- LOVE YOU.

932
00:30:08,565 --> 00:30:10,429
- "NO STUPID PEOPLE."

933
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:11,671
LET'’S KEEP IT MOVING.

934
00:30:11,671 --> 00:30:13,259
NO NEED TO STOP HERE.

935
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:15,296
CLEARLY WE'’RE NOT WANTED.

936
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,815
- ALL MY FAMILY
HAS MET ROGER,

937
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,886
BUT THEY HAVE NOT MET MEILANI.

938
00:30:18,886 --> 00:30:21,578
SO WE'’RE GOING
TO MY COUSIN APRIL'’S CAMPSITE

939
00:30:21,578 --> 00:30:24,339
SO WE CAN HAVE BREAKFAST
AND SEE MY FAMILY.

940
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:25,927
GOOD MORNING.

941
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:26,963
all: GOOD MORNING!

942
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:27,998
- NEIGHBORS.

943
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:29,828
- HI.

944
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,347
- OH, YOU GUYS
HAVEN'’T MET HER YET.

945
00:30:32,347 --> 00:30:33,452
- NO, THEY HAVEN'’T.

946
00:30:33,452 --> 00:30:34,556
- SHE GOT BIG, RIGHT?

947
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:36,075
- SHE EATS ALREADY
MORE THAN DAD DOES.

948
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:37,249
- DOES SHE REALLY?
- OH, GOD.

949
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:38,560
- SHE GOT UP THREE TIMES
LAST NIGHT.

950
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,424
8-OUNCE BOTTLES.

951
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:41,391
- WHERE'’S ALL THE FOOD?

952
00:30:41,391 --> 00:30:42,599
- FOOD!

953
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:44,049
- YEAH, I KEEP HEARING
ABOUT THIS FRIED DOUGH.

954
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:45,050
- YEAH.

955
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,051
- IT'’S A BIG TRADITION, I HEAR,

956
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:47,052
IN THE MORNING UP HERE, HUH?

957
00:30:47,052 --> 00:30:48,467
- THE TRADITION.

958
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:51,263
- JENNI HAS BEEN TELLING ME
ONE OF HER FAMILY TRADITIONS

959
00:30:51,263 --> 00:30:52,505
IS EATING FRIED DOUGH,

960
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:54,162
IN THE MORNING, FOR BREAKFAST.

961
00:30:54,162 --> 00:30:56,164
- DAN'’S GOT THE OIL GOING.

962
00:30:56,164 --> 00:30:58,373
I AM READY FOR FRIED DOUGH.

963
00:30:58,373 --> 00:31:00,099
- FRIED DOUGH
IS ALWAYS SPECTACULAR.

964
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,307
IT'’S MY FAVORITE THING.

965
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:03,275
I ACTUALLY THINK
IT'’S JUST PIZZA DOUGH

966
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:06,002
DEEP-FRIED WITH BUTTER,

967
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:08,245
POWDERED SUGAR,
AND CINNAMON ON TOP.

968
00:31:08,245 --> 00:31:10,075
IT'’S AMAZING.

969
00:31:10,075 --> 00:31:11,835
- HAVEN'’T HAD ONE OF THESE
SINCE THE BLUE HILL FAIR

970
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:15,114
BACK IN MAINE.

971
00:31:15,114 --> 00:31:16,805
- OH, YEAH.

972
00:31:16,805 --> 00:31:18,773
I USED TO EAT,
LIKE, 17 OF THESE.

973
00:31:18,773 --> 00:31:19,947
- [laughs]

974
00:31:19,947 --> 00:31:22,777
I FEEL GUILTY EATING ONE.

975
00:31:22,777 --> 00:31:25,055
- NO GUILT,
NO [...] GIVEN.

976
00:31:25,055 --> 00:31:27,333
I ATE IT AND ENJOYED IT.

977
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,301
- LITERALLY NO [...] GIVEN.

978
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:31,096
- SHUT--

979
00:31:31,096 --> 00:31:32,891
[...].

980
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,513
WHEN I TEXT A PICTURE
TO MY TRAINER,

981
00:31:34,513 --> 00:31:36,066
HE'’LL BE REALLY PLEASED.

982
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,966
JUST BE LIKE,
"HEY, HERE'’S MY BREAKFAST.

983
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:40,519
SEE YOU ON SUNDAY.

984
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,486
ALL RIGHT, ONE MORE.

985
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:45,317
THAT WAS GOOD.

986
00:31:45,317 --> 00:31:47,664
LET ME SEE IF SHE'’S HUNGRY.

987
00:31:47,664 --> 00:31:48,699
- WANT YOUR MAMA?

988
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,287
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

989
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:51,806
AWW.

990
00:31:51,806 --> 00:31:53,221
"I'’M SO HUNGRY!"

991
00:31:53,221 --> 00:31:54,222
- WHERE'’S THE BABA?

992
00:31:54,222 --> 00:31:55,672
- "I'’M SO HUNGRY!"

993
00:31:55,672 --> 00:31:58,744
- I'’VE NEVER SEEN A BABY
EAT THAT MUCH, EVER.

994
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,090
WELL, EXCEPT FOR MAYBE YOU.

995
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,576
[laughter]

996
00:32:03,576 --> 00:32:06,234
- OH, YEAH, I WAS
A FRIGGIN'’ BEAST OF A CHILD.

997
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:07,546
I SAW MY PICTURES.

998
00:32:07,546 --> 00:32:10,721
UP UNTIL, LIKE, 8 YEARS OLD,
I WAS A LITTLE PORKER.

999
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,378
I HAD ROLLS.

1000
00:32:12,378 --> 00:32:14,139
- LIKE A LITTLE SUMO WRESTLER.

1001
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:15,968
[laughter]

1002
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:17,280
- THAT'’S WHY THEY CALL IT
DEER RUN,

1003
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,765
'’CAUSE THEY SAW YOU.

1004
00:32:19,765 --> 00:32:21,111
- WHAT IS THAT EVEN
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

1005
00:32:21,111 --> 00:32:23,631
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
YOUR OWN JOKES AT THIS POINT?

1006
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:24,873
- YOU'’RE HIDEOUS,
AND THEY SAW YOU,

1007
00:32:24,873 --> 00:32:25,874
AND THEY RAN THE OTHER WAY.

1008
00:32:25,874 --> 00:32:26,875
- I'’M HIDEOUS?

1009
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,532
- [laughing]

1010
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:29,948
AS A BABY, YOU WERE.

1011
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,294
- I WAS PUDGY.

1012
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:32,571
- THEY THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA EAT '’EM.

1013
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:34,711
- THEY PROBABLY DID.

1014
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:35,712
- LET'’S PUT IT LIKE THIS.

1015
00:32:35,712 --> 00:32:37,645
I CAN'’T HOLD HER BARE-CHESTED,

1016
00:32:37,645 --> 00:32:38,922
'’CAUSE SHE LOOKS FOR A NIPPLE.

1017
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:40,959
- YEAH, SHE DOES.

1018
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,339
- SHE STARTS...

1019
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:45,239
[laughter]

1020
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:54,524
- MIKE, WERE YOU GUYS GONNA
COME TO MY HOUSE, OR NO?

1021
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:55,594
ALL RIGHT.

1022
00:32:55,594 --> 00:32:57,147
TODAY WE HAVE MORE DELIVERIES
TO COME,

1023
00:32:57,147 --> 00:33:00,081
MORE FURNITURE TO PUT TOGETHER,
TAKE OUT OF THE POD.

1024
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:02,532
SO IT'’S TIME TO BRING IN
THE REINFORCEMENTS,

1025
00:33:02,532 --> 00:33:04,637
'’CAUSE WE HAVE A LOT
OF STUFF TO DO.

1026
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:06,674
I JUST TALKED TO THE TWINS.

1027
00:33:06,674 --> 00:33:08,020
THEY HAVE A BIG TRUCK FOR US.

1028
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,264
THEY'’RE GONNA COME TAKE
WHATEVER'’S AT THE HOUSE.

1029
00:33:10,264 --> 00:33:12,473
SO THEY HAVE A FEW GUYS
TO HELP.

1030
00:33:12,473 --> 00:33:15,994
- OKAY.

1031
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,099
- I'’LL GET IT.

1032
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,445
- BEFORE JIONNI GETS BACK,

1033
00:33:19,445 --> 00:33:21,689
CAN WE PUT BABY JESUS
ON HIS BAR?

1034
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:25,072
I DEFINITELY WANT TO PUT
THE BABY JESUS IN THE MAN CAVE,

1035
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:26,314
JUST TO PISS JIONNI OFF.

1036
00:33:26,314 --> 00:33:28,316
AND I FEEL LIKE
IT WAS IN THE MAN CAVE,

1037
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:32,700
THEN JIONNI WOULD THINK TWICE
ABOUT MAYBE GETTING TOO DRUNK.

1038
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,701
THINK HE'’LL LIKE IT?

1039
00:33:33,701 --> 00:33:34,909
- NOT DOWN HERE.

1040
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:36,497
[laughter]

1041
00:33:36,497 --> 00:33:39,534
- MY COUSINS AND FRIENDS
ARE GONNA COME HELP ME OUT.

1042
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:40,811
THIS IS DEFINITELY THE A-TEAM.

1043
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,261
I GOT MY COUSIN ALPHONSE,

1044
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:43,952
MY COUSINS ANTHONY AND MICHAEL,

1045
00:33:43,952 --> 00:33:45,264
AND MY BROTHER JAMES.

1046
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:46,645
GET OFF THE GRASS!

1047
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:47,991
WE'’RE GONNA GET THIS DONE,

1048
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:49,855
AND FINALLY I GET SOME HELP.

1049
00:33:49,855 --> 00:33:51,374
- ARE YOU GUYS GOOD BUILDERS?

1050
00:33:51,374 --> 00:33:53,514
- NO.
- NO.

1051
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:54,653
- OH, MY GOD.

1052
00:33:54,653 --> 00:33:56,448
- BABE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1053
00:33:56,448 --> 00:33:58,415
- I'’M TAKING A LUNCH BREAK.

1054
00:33:58,415 --> 00:33:59,692
- RIGHT ON TIME.

1055
00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:02,902
- HEY, JUST IN TIME.

1056
00:34:02,902 --> 00:34:04,456
- WE'’RE HERE; WE'’RE DOING IT.

1057
00:34:04,456 --> 00:34:05,905
I BROUGHT YOU THIS,
THE CHRISTENING.

1058
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:08,287
- UH-OH, NOW WE'’RE IN TROUBLE.

1059
00:34:08,287 --> 00:34:09,771
NOW THAT I GOT
THE WHOLE CREW THERE,

1060
00:34:09,771 --> 00:34:10,979
I'’M GONNA, YOU KNOW,
CHRISTEN THE BAR,

1061
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:12,222
HAVE THE FIRST DRINK WITH THEM.

1062
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:13,982
I'’VE BEEN ENVISIONING
THIS MOMENT,

1063
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:16,295
AND I FINALLY GOT
THE GROUP OF GUYS TO DO IT.

1064
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:18,504
WHO PUT JESUS CHRIST ON MY BAR?

1065
00:34:18,504 --> 00:34:19,747
[laughter]

1066
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:21,059
OH, MY GOD.

1067
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,957
- GETTING RELIGIOUS DOWN HERE?

1068
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:24,269
- AH, THAT'’S NICOLE.

1069
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:25,373
- OH, OKAY.

1070
00:34:25,373 --> 00:34:26,374
- OH.

1071
00:34:26,374 --> 00:34:27,582
- WHAT'’S THE PICTURE THING?

1072
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:28,825
- BABY JESUS DRINKS WINE.

1073
00:34:28,825 --> 00:34:30,413
EVERYBODY DRINKS WINE.

1074
00:34:30,413 --> 00:34:34,382
THAT'’S HIS..."BLOOD."

1075
00:34:34,382 --> 00:34:36,004
- YOU'’RE STUPID.

1076
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:37,661
- WANT TO SEE A MAGIC TRICK?

1077
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:38,869
- FOR REAL?
- YEAH.

1078
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:39,974
I'’M GONNA MAKE VODKA DISAPPEAR.

1079
00:34:39,974 --> 00:34:41,113
[laughter]

1080
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,218
- FIRST PARTY.

1081
00:34:42,218 --> 00:34:43,529
I JUST COULDN'’T WAIT
TO SIT THERE,

1082
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:44,944
SERVE MY DRINKS.

1083
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:46,256
AND I GOT RED CUPS
TO DRINK OUT OF.

1084
00:34:46,256 --> 00:34:47,464
I DON'’T CARE.

1085
00:34:47,464 --> 00:34:49,121
AT THIS POINT, HEY,
IT'’S ALL WORTH IT.

1086
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:51,434
- THIS IS THE FIRST OF
A LOT OF DRINKS DOWN HERE.

1087
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:52,711
- THAT'’S IT.
- LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

1088
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:54,022
GOOD LUCK; BEST OF LUCK.

1089
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:57,164
- I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

1090
00:34:57,164 --> 00:34:58,234
I CAN'’T NOT DO ANYTHING.

1091
00:34:58,234 --> 00:34:59,752
- THAT'’S PUT TOGETHER.

1092
00:35:02,962 --> 00:35:05,793
- NICOLE, DO YOU WANT ME
TO UNWRAP THE COUCHES?

1093
00:35:05,793 --> 00:35:07,243
[cheering]

1094
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:08,830
- I COULD SIT DOWN HERE ALL DAY.

1095
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,142
AND YOU GOT THE TV.

1096
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,799
- TO THE LIGHTS.

1097
00:35:11,799 --> 00:35:13,007
THANK GOD.

1098
00:35:13,007 --> 00:35:16,321
- THAT'’S IT, OKAY.

1099
00:35:16,321 --> 00:35:17,563
- WE NEED ANOTHER BOTTLE.

1100
00:35:17,563 --> 00:35:18,599
HERE WE GO.

1101
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:19,703
THAT'’S THE SPIRIT.

1102
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,257
NOBODY LIKES TO DRINK ALONE.

1103
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:23,983
ALPHONSE WOULD BE DOING
A WET T-SHIRT CONTEST.

1104
00:35:23,983 --> 00:35:25,916
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

1105
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:26,917
- WHAT?

1106
00:35:26,917 --> 00:35:27,918
[laughter]

1107
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:28,919
WE'’RE MOVING.

1108
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:29,920
- WE'’RE WORKING.

1109
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,921
- WE'’RE WORKING ON THE BAR.

1110
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:31,957
- YEAH.

1111
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:33,752
- IT'’S 3:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.

1112
00:35:33,752 --> 00:35:35,271
I'’M DEFINITELY ANNOYED
RIGHT NOW,

1113
00:35:35,271 --> 00:35:37,652
BECAUSE JIONNI IS THE RINGLEADER
OF THIS ALL,

1114
00:35:37,652 --> 00:35:40,310
AND HE'’S HAVING EVERYBODY DRINK
AND GO CRAZY,

1115
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:41,760
AND I'’M JUST LIKE, SERIOUSLY,

1116
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,003
LIKE, YOU GUYS ARE SUPPOSED
TO COME HERE AND HELP US OUT,

1117
00:35:44,003 --> 00:35:45,177
NOT DRINK.

1118
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:46,592
I MEAN, IT'’S NOT EVEN
OUR HOUSE YET.

1119
00:35:46,592 --> 00:35:49,077
I DON'’T EVEN THINK WE'’RE
SUPPOSED TO PARTYING HERE YET.

1120
00:35:49,077 --> 00:35:50,769
YOU KNOW WE'’RE STILL
MOVING IN, RIGHT?

1121
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:52,046
WE DON'’T LIVE HERE YET.

1122
00:35:52,046 --> 00:35:53,047
- OH, WE DON'’T?
- NO.

1123
00:35:53,047 --> 00:35:55,739
- WE'’RE TESTING; IT'’S GOOD.

1124
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:57,776
- THEY'’RE DOWNSTAIRS PARTYING.

1125
00:35:57,776 --> 00:35:59,226
- NO, THEY HAVE TO GET
THAT STUFF IN.

1126
00:35:59,226 --> 00:36:00,227
- I KNOW.

1127
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:01,469
- DOLLAR BEERS.

1128
00:36:01,469 --> 00:36:02,953
WHAT IS IT, TUESDAY,
THURSDAY OR SOMETHING?

1129
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,955
- I THINK THURSDAY.
- YEAH.

1130
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,164
- THE BEST.

1131
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,062
[laughter]

1132
00:36:08,062 --> 00:36:09,581
- LET'’S GO; BREAK'’S OVER.

1133
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:11,134
- IT'’S NOT A BREAK;
WE DIDN'’T START.

1134
00:36:11,134 --> 00:36:12,653
- THE BOSS SPOKE; LET'’S GO.

1135
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:15,173
- AW, DAMN IT.

1136
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,484
NOW ALL THE ICE IS GONNA MELT.

1137
00:36:16,484 --> 00:36:17,623
COME ON, GUYS.

1138
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:18,969
LET'’S GET THIS OVER WITH.

1139
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:20,108
LIFT IT.

1140
00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:22,283
BANG UP THE WHOLE BOTTOM OF IT.

1141
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:23,388
ARE YOU LIFTING?

1142
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:25,079
I HEARD A LOT OF TALKING
BEFORE IN THERE,

1143
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,977
BUT WE'’RE THE ONLY ONES
OUT HERE IN THE RAIN.

1144
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:30,257
- LIFT AND TURN.
- LIKE A MAN.

1145
00:36:30,257 --> 00:36:31,568
- YOU GOOD?
- YEAH.

1146
00:36:31,568 --> 00:36:33,260
- I CAN'’T CARRY THIS.

1147
00:36:36,055 --> 00:36:38,299
- BACK.

1148
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:40,750
GOOD JOB, YOU DID REAL GOOD,
I'’M REAL PROUD OF YOU.

1149
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,785
THIS WAS A GREAT TIME.

1150
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:42,890
- YOU GOT A FREE LUNCH.

1151
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,271
- YOU SHOULD INVITE
ME OVER AGAIN.

1152
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:54,591
- BYE, HOUSE.
- BYE, HOUSE.

1153
00:36:54,591 --> 00:36:55,937
- BACK TO THE BASEMENT.

1154
00:36:55,937 --> 00:36:57,663
- LAST NIGHT IN THE BASEMENT.

1155
00:36:57,663 --> 00:36:58,940
- I KNOW IT'’S NOT GONNA BE

1156
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,804
THE LAST NIGHT OR DAY
IN THE BASEMENT,

1157
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:02,910
BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE
A LOT TO DO.

1158
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,325
WE HAVE TO MOVE
ALL THE FURNITURE IN.

1159
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:06,224
WE'’RE WAITING FOR OUR C.O.

1160
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,295
OUR HOUSE NEEDS
TO GET INSPECTED.

1161
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:10,607
SO IT'’S GONNA BE,
LIKE, A COUPLE WEEKS,

1162
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:12,644
SO I DON'’T KNOW WHY
HE KEEPS SAYING IT.

1163
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:15,440
WAIT, IS THAT NINJA TURTLE THING
RIGHT HERE?

1164
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,579
- NINJA TURTLE THING?

1165
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:18,132
- YEAH, THE SEWER.

1166
00:37:18,132 --> 00:37:19,582
- OH, MY--
YOU'’RE AN INFANT.

1167
00:37:19,582 --> 00:37:20,790
GO, YOU'’RE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO IT.

1168
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,825
- WHERE IS IT?
- GO.

1169
00:37:21,825 --> 00:37:23,137
- BABE, I'’M GONNA SCRATCH
MY CAR.

1170
00:37:23,137 --> 00:37:25,208
- GO, NICOLE, YOU'’RE 17 FEET
AWAY FROM IT.

1171
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,209
- I'’M JUST MAKING SURE.

1172
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:27,245
- A NINJA TURTLE THING?

1173
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,280
ARE YOU REAL?

1174
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,523
- THAT'’S WHERE THEY LIVED.

1175
00:37:29,523 --> 00:37:31,214
- OH, MY GOD.

1176
00:37:39,912 --> 00:37:43,019
- LORENZO.

1177
00:37:43,019 --> 00:37:44,503
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?

1178
00:37:44,503 --> 00:37:46,056
- LORENZO, EW.

1179
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,437
- LORENZO, DO YOU WANT SOME HAM?

1180
00:37:47,437 --> 00:37:48,438
- WHY DO YOU--

1181
00:37:48,438 --> 00:37:49,681
- EASY THERE, LORENZO.

1182
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:51,130
- LORENZO, STOP.

1183
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,477
- MIGHT PASS OUT.

1184
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:53,857
- STOP.

1185
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:55,583
STOP IT.

1186
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:57,827
LORENZO'’S JUST BEING
SO WEIRD LATELY.

1187
00:37:57,827 --> 00:38:01,727
HE JUST ALWAYS PUTS HIS FACE
IN ME AND JIONNI'’S BUTT,

1188
00:38:01,727 --> 00:38:02,866
AND IT'’S WEIRD.

1189
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:04,074
ALL RIGHT.

1190
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,628
- LAST NIGHT IN THE BASEMENT.

1191
00:38:05,628 --> 00:38:06,870
- BYE, MOM, THANK YOU.

1192
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:07,871
- OKAY.

1193
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:08,907
- GOOD NIGHT.

1194
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:14,637
IT LOOKS EMPTY DOWN HERE.

1195
00:38:14,637 --> 00:38:16,328
SO, WALKING DOWN
INTO THE BASEMENT,

1196
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:17,709
IT JUST HITS ME, YOU KNOW,

1197
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:19,642
THAT WE'’RE ACTUALLY MOVING OUT

1198
00:38:19,642 --> 00:38:22,541
AND WE'’RE NOT GONNA BE LIVING
IN THE BASEMENT ANYMORE.

1199
00:38:22,541 --> 00:38:23,611
IT'’S SAD.

1200
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:24,716
I DON'’T WANT TO LEAVE.

1201
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:27,097
- OH, CHRIST, HERE WE GO.

1202
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,478
- LET'’S JUST STAY HERE.

1203
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:30,273
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR
[bleep] MIND?

1204
00:38:30,273 --> 00:38:31,481
- EASY HERE.

1205
00:38:31,481 --> 00:38:33,103
WE'’VE BEEN LIVING HERE
FOR TWO YEARS.

1206
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,761
IT'’S LIKE WE'’RE MOVING ON TO
THE NEXT CHAPTER IN OUR LIVES.

1207
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:37,867
COME ON, COME ON.

1208
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:38,937
- NO.

1209
00:38:38,937 --> 00:38:40,179
- WHY CAN'’T I GO IN THE CRIB?

1210
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:41,595
[Lorenzo whining]

1211
00:38:41,595 --> 00:38:42,872
LAST DAY IN THE BASEMENT.

1212
00:38:42,872 --> 00:38:44,529
- BUT YOU KNOW YOU'’RE
A LITTLE SAD TO LEAVE.

1213
00:38:44,529 --> 00:38:47,152
- NO, I AM NOT EVEN
REMOTELY CLOSE TO SAD.

1214
00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:48,912
GOOD NIGHT, LORENZO.

1215
00:38:48,912 --> 00:38:50,707
- DADDY CAN'’T SAY BOO?

1216
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:52,053
OKAY.

1217
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:53,054
- GOOD NIGHT.

1218
00:38:53,054 --> 00:38:54,090
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1219
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:56,230
- LAST NIGHT IN THE BASEMENT.

1220
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,818
