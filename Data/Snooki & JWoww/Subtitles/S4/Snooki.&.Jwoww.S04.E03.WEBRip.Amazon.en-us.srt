1
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:09,877
- PREVIOUSLY ON...
- SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW...

2
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,179
- BRING THE HANDS FORWARD.

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,181
- I FEEL LIKE THIS COULD
ACTUALLY BRING ON LABOR.

4
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:14,482
- IT'S GONNA POP OUT
THAT BABY.

5
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,084
I WANT TO DO
THE TELEPHONES.

6
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:18,152
WITH STRING.
- THAT DOES NOT WORK.

7
00:00:18,252 --> 00:00:19,320
- SOMETHING'S LEAKING
OUT OF ME.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,622
- IS IT PEE,
OR DID YOUR WATER BREAK?

9
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,324
- IT LOOKED
LIKE SNOT.

10
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:24,992
- THAT'S YOUR
MUCOUS PLUG.

11
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:27,027
- I THINK IT IS.

12
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,529
- YOU'RE GOING
INTO LABOR.

13
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:30,698
- * I DON'T CARE

14
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,166
* I LOVE IT

15
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,468
* I DON'T CARE

16
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,237
* I LOVE IT
I LOVE IT *

17
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:38,339
* I DON'T CARE

18
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:41,509
* I LOVE IT

19
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:42,676
* I DON'T CARE

20
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:48,582
[pop music playing]

21
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:50,351
- ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE GONNA GO SEE AUNT JENNI.

22
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:56,023
AND WE'RE GONNA
MAKE TELEPHONES.

23
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:59,560
WHAT DO YOU DO
WITH A TELEPHONE?

24
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,595
HELLO.
BLUH-BLUH-BLUH-BLUH.

25
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:04,332
SO TODAY, I'M GONNA TAKE LORENZO
OVER TO JENNI'S HOUSE

26
00:01:04,432 --> 00:01:05,499
AND HANG OUT,

27
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:08,136
AND JENNI IS, YOU KNOW,
NINE MONTHS PREGNANT.

28
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:10,138
HER LIFE
IS COMPLETELY CHANGING,

29
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:12,039
AND SHE JUST HAS
NO IDEA YET,

30
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,942
SO WHY NOT HANG OUT WITH HER
EVERY SINGLE DAY?

31
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,844
CAN YOU SAY "JENNI"?

32
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,912
- NO.
- WHY?

33
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,148
SUCH A BRAT.

34
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:21,315
THAT'S YOUR GODMOMMY.

35
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:23,551
IF I DIE,
SHE'S YOUR NEW MOMMY.

36
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,886
- [laughs]
- THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

37
00:01:25,986 --> 00:01:27,821
I'M GONNA DIE.

38
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,724
REMEMBER WE TALKED
ABOUT MAKING A PHONE?

39
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:31,992
- OH, YEAH.

40
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,727
- I BOUGHT STRING.

41
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,062
- I HAVE CANS.

42
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:38,232
- WE CAN TIE THEM TOGETHER
AND THEN SEE IF THEY WORK.

43
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,067
- I BROUGHT STRING
OVER TO JENNI'S,

44
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:43,171
BECAUSE I WANT TO TRY
AND MAKE THESE TELEPHONE CANS.

45
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:46,274
AND I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE NEIGHBORS
DO THESE KINDS OF THINGS.

46
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:47,541
LIKE, THE KIDS.
- YEAH.

47
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,443
- LIKE WHEN THEY WANT TO, LIKE,
TALK TO EACH OTHER,

48
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,044
AND IT'S, LIKE,
TOO LATE.

49
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,214
YOU KNOW, THEY WANT TO BE LIKE,
"HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

50
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:56,217
LIKE, I WANT TO BE LIKE THAT,
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE ADULTS.

51
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:57,451
- WITH CELL PHONES.

52
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,986
TO BE LIKE,
"HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

53
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,488
WE GOT TO MAKE THIS WORK.

54
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:01,955
ROGER DOESN'T THINK
IT'S GONNA WORK.

55
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,891
AND I HAVE TO PROVE
HIM WRONG LIKE ALWAYS.

56
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,025
- WE'LL PROVE HIM WRONG.

57
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:06,594
JIONNI SAID
IT WORKS, SO...

58
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,731
WHAT, YOU DON'T
BELIEVE MY MAN?

59
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:12,333
YOU'RE RUDE.

60
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:16,204
- I WOULD LOVE FOR IT TO, LIKE,
REALLY, REALLY WORK,

61
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,971
ENOUGH FOR ROGER
TO, LIKE, NOT DENY IT,

62
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,473
'CAUSE I HATE
WHEN HE'S RIGHT.

63
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:20,541
SO ANNOYING.

64
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,975
- 'CAUSE HE THINKS
EVERYTHING IS...

65
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,711
- LOGIC, AND HIS WAY, AND...

66
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,314
- 'CAUSE SOMETIMES
EVERYTHING CAN BE MAGICAL.

67
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:28,216
[harp playing]
AND THIS IS MAGICAL.

68
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:29,583
- [laughs]
WHAT THE [bleep]?

69
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:30,718
OH, MY GOD.

70
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,052
"MAGICAL."
- I DON'T KNOW.

71
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,387
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

72
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,863
- EW. IT SMELLS LIKE FISH.

73
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:44,097
- [laughs]

74
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:46,133
- YOUR ARMPITS SMELL.
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

75
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:47,468
- WHAT?

76
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,237
YOU HEARD IT?

77
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,339
- CAN YOU HEAR ME?
- [screams]

78
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,274
I HEAR YOU!

79
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,809
VAGINA HOLE.

80
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,278
- VAGINA HOLE.

81
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,146
- I HEAR YOU!

82
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,514
IT WORKS!

83
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,015
- I HAD NO IDEA.
- WE'RE GENIUSES.

84
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:03,251
WE SHOULD SELL
THIS [bleep].

85
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:05,253
I CAN HEAR JENNI
IN THE FRICKIN' CAN.

86
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:07,921
- IT'S CREEPY.
- IT'S SO WEIRD.

87
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,989
- YEAH.
WE'RE FANCY NOW.

88
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,057
WE INVENTED IT.

89
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,025
- YEAH.
WE'RE, LIKE, REALLY SMART.

90
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,827
- WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH STRING.

91
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:15,263
- SO WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA ADD, THEN?

92
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,497
- I HAVE, LIKE, RIBBON.

93
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:19,500
WE DID IT, BUT WE
HAVE TO CONNECT HOUSES.

94
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,435
- AND THEN WE CAN SEE
IF THE [bleep] WORKS.

95
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,003
HOW ARE YOU GONNA
GET IT TO ME?

96
00:03:23,103 --> 00:03:24,137
- I DON'T KNOW.

97
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:25,573
I HAVEN'T FIGURED
THAT PART OUT YET.

98
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:29,009
- TIE IT ON A BROOM,
AND THEN LIFT THE BROOM UP.

99
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,778
MACGYVER THAT [bleep].

100
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,413
- DO YOU HAVE
A 25-FOOT BROOM?

101
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,284
OH, [bleep].
- WHAT?

102
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:37,285
[screams]

103
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:40,321
WHOA!

104
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,055
- ALL RIGHT.

105
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,057
both:
YEAH!

106
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,393
- I JUST WENT
INTO LABOR.

107
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:48,862
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

108
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,030
HELLO?

109
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:53,767
- HELLO.

110
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:55,736
- OH!
HEY, I CAN HEAR YOU.

111
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:57,037
WE PROVED ROGER WRONG.
- MM-HMM.

112
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,806
- AND I CAN'T WAIT
FOR HIM TO LISTEN.

113
00:03:58,906 --> 00:03:59,973
- HE'S GONNA FREAK OUT.

114
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,475
- MM-HMM.
HE'S GONNA TRY AND DENY IT.

115
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,311
- HE'LL BE LIKE, "NO,
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING."

116
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,112
- YEAH.
[laughs]

117
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,314
- WHAT'S UP?

118
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,181
- NOTHING MUCH.
WHAT YOU DOING?

119
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:11,319
- I HAVE TO GO POOP.

120
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:13,854
- DO NOT TAKE THIS
IN THE BATHROOM WITH YOU.

121
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,989
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

122
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,526
- I CAN HEAR YOU RIGHT THERE.

123
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,227
WE COULD JUST YELL
OUT THE WINDOW.

124
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,062
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

125
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:23,631
ALL RIGHT.

126
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:24,832
SHE CLOSED THE WINDOW.
BYE.

127
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,233
- BYE.
- BYE.

128
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,568
- BYE.

129
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:30,438
- * OUTSIDE

130
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:33,173
* ON THE BACK PORCH

131
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,477
- FIGHT NIGHT!
- FIGHT NIGHT!

132
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,346
- WE LEFT LORENZO HOME.
IT'S BEDTIME.

133
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,813
HE'S WITH A BABYSITTER.

134
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,449
ADULT NIGHT.

135
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,684
- LET'S GET WASTED.
- WHOO!

136
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,985
- BABE.
- YEAH.

137
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:47,755
- I HAD AN ACCIDENT AGAIN.

138
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,357
- YOU PEED?
[laughs]

139
00:04:49,457 --> 00:04:50,624
- YOU PEED YOUR PANTS?

140
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,726
- GO CHANGE
YOUR PANTS.

141
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,595
- WHEN'D YOU PEE YOUR PANTS?

142
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,765
- I TRIED TO HOLD MY SNEEZE
GOING UP THE STAIRS.

143
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,166
- HAH.

144
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,969
- DID YOU GO RIGHT THROUGH YOUR
GREAT BIG, GIANT GRANNY PANTIES?

145
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,471
- I PEED THE FLOOR
A LITTLE BIT.

146
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:04,538
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

147
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,574
- YOU PEED ON THE FLOOR?

148
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,275
- OH, MY GOOD LORD.

149
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:10,043
WHY DO YOU THINK NICOLE
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

150
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,179
WHEN SHE FLUSHED HER UNDERWEAR
DOWN THE TOILET

151
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,447
IN THE JERSEY SHORE HOUSE,

152
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:14,548
AND PLUGGED THE TOILET UP?

153
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,550
- WHAT DID SHE DO?

154
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,120
- I WAS DRUNK AND I
LEFT MY PERIOD UNDIES.

155
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,389
- EW.

156
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,391
- 'CAUSE I DID IT
ON PURPOSE, JIONNI.

157
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,658
YOU'RE SO MEAN!

158
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,394
- YOU DO IT EVERY
OTHER MONTH AT OUR HOUSE.

159
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,628
- YOU'RE SO MEAN.

160
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,798
- I SEE UNDERWEAR
WITH BROWN, RED, YELLOW...

161
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,900
- IT WAS MY SHORTS.
IT WAS MY SLEEP SHORTS.

162
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,002
EVERYBODY POOPS,

163
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,137
AND SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN.

164
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,506
I'M PREGNANT.

165
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:42,410
IT'S SOMETIMES HARD
TO GET BACK THERE.

166
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,612
- I SAW A PAIR OF SHORTS
WITH POOP STAINS.

167
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,213
I'M LIKE, "NICOLE."

168
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,915
I GO, "YOUR UNDERWEAR
DISGUSTS--"

169
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,450
SHE GOES,
"THEY'RE MY SHORTS."

170
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,018
- IT WAS MY SLEEP SHORTS.

171
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:52,953
- IT'S JUST THE SHORTS.

172
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,321
GREAT.
THAT'S OKAY.

173
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:55,923
[bleep] IN YOUR SLEEP SHORTS.

174
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,291
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

175
00:05:58,426 --> 00:05:59,960
- OW. OW.
- THAT'S FINE.

176
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,095
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
THEY'RE SLEEP SHORTS.

177
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,631
- IT MUST HAVE BEEN
A FART OR SOMETHING.

178
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,698
I DON'T KNOW.

179
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,101
DIESEL, THEY'RE
MAKING FUN OF ME.

180
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,703
- ROGER SHARTED TOO, ONCE,

181
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:10,938
AND HE HAD TO THROW HIS
UNDERWEAR OUT.

182
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,339
- EXACTLY.

183
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,442
IT HAPPENED AT WORK TWICE,
AND I'LL READILY ADMIT IT.

184
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,544
- I'M DEFINITELY EMOTIONAL--
I'M A ROLLERCOASTER--

185
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:19,212
SO YOU NEVER KNOW.
IF JIONNI SAYS SOMETHING,

186
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,582
I CAN EITHER LAUGH,
I CAN CRY,

187
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:22,950
OR I CAN PUNCH HIM
IN THE FACE.

188
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,718
- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU
PUNCH HIM IN THE FACE.

189
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,454
- NO, I CAN'T.

190
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:27,721
BUT I WANT TO.

191
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,322
IS THAT CHANNING TATUM?
- THIS IS--YEAH.

192
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:31,792
- HE'S JACKED.
- [bleep] IS IS NAME?

193
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,193
EVERYBODY HAS A FREE PASS?

194
00:06:33,293 --> 00:06:34,261
- WHO'S YOURS?

195
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,496
- MINE OR HERS?
- YOURS.

196
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:36,764
I KNOW HERS.

197
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:38,466
- WHO'S HERS?
- TOM HARDY.

198
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:39,633
- YEAH, TOM HARDY.

199
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,101
- I HAVE A NEW ONE THAT I LIKE.
- WHO?

200
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,203
WHO?

201
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,839
- THAT GIRL, UH--
I HAVE A FEW, ACTUALLY.

202
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,908
- OH, WAIT, THE BLONDE
THAT TURNS INTO THE--

203
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:49,677
- JENNIFER LAWRENCE?
- SCARLETT JOHANSSON.

204
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:51,344
- OH, YEAH,
I LIKE JENNIFER LAWRENCE.

205
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,913
- I DON'T LIKE HER ANYMORE.
THANKS A LOT.

206
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,882
YOU'RE SO STUPID.
WHY DO YOU HAVE A FEW NOW?

207
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56,349
- WHY ARE YOU
CHECKING OUT OTHER GIRLS

208
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:57,785
LIKE I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH?

209
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:02,122
- J.LO, SCARLETT JOHANSSON,

210
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:03,857
JENNIFER LAWRENCE.

211
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,894
IF WE WERE IN THE WILDERNESS,
SHE'D PROTECT ME.

212
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:08,395
- I WOULDN'T?

213
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:09,997
- SHE'D HAVE A CROSSBOW
AND KILL THINGS,

214
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,264
AND WE COULD EAT TOGETHER.

215
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,900
- JIONNI, IT'S A MOVIE.

216
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,702
- YOU'RE AFRAID OF SPIDERS.
- SHE'S ACTING. SHE'S ACTING.

217
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:16,103
IT'S NOT REAL.

218
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,772
- I BET YOU--I GUARANTEE YOU SHE
COULD SHOOT A BOW AND ARROW.

219
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:19,807
- GO BE WITH HER, THEN.

220
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:20,941
- YOU HATE SPIDERS.

221
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,142
IF WE WERE IN THE WILDERNESS,

222
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,512
JENNIFER LAWRENCE
WOULD BE GOOD TO BE WITH.

223
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,847
- SO YOU WOULD LEAVE ME
SO YOU CAN SURVIVE?

224
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,081
YOU HAVE A FEW NOW?

225
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,517
- OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

226
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,684
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

227
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,386
- I DON'T LIKE YOU.
[bleep].

228
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,856
- STOP. I'M KIDDING.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

229
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,525
- IT'S JUST J.LO.
IT'S JUST J.LO.

230
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,527
- NO, IT'S NOT.

231
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,028
I DON'T EVEN LOOK
AT OTHER GUYS AND SAY,

232
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:42,963
"OOH, I WANT TO HAVE
SEX WITH HIM."

233
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,064
- I SAID ONE.

234
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:47,000
- YOUR ASS IS HAIRY.

235
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,268
YOU SMELL LIKE BALLS.

236
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,541
ALL THE TIME.
- SHUT--

237
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,675
- I'M GONNA GIVE BIRTH.

238
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,783
- HERE, LET'S CALL AUNT JENNI.

239
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,184
- OVER THERE.
- ALL RIGHT.

240
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:06,153
- THIS IS NOT
HOW YOU DO THROW PILLOWS.

241
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:07,154
- HERE.

242
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:08,421
I DON'T DO THROW PILLOWS.

243
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:11,892
- JENNI!

244
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,195
IS THIS HOW IT WORKS?

245
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,064
- WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT IS SHE DOING?

246
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,132
- CAN YOU LISTEN?
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

247
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:22,269
- SO NICOLE'S YELLING AT ME TO
TELL ME TO PICK UP MY PHONE CAN,

248
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:26,974
AND I'M DYING FOR MR. ROGER
TO COME CHECK IT OUT.

249
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:29,076
BABE, THE THING DOESN'T HAVE
A RINGER ON IT.

250
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,378
IT'S NOT LIKE I KNOW
SHE'S CALLING ME

251
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:32,680
RIGHT NOW
FROM THE TELEPHONE.

252
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,615
- YOU JUST HAD A CONVERSATION
THROUGH THIS WINDOW,

253
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,717
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA GO
OVER TO THE TELEPHONE WINDOW,

254
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:38,318
AND YOU'RE GONNA HOLD
THE THING UP TO YOUR EAR.

255
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,687
YOU COULD HEAR HER FINE
THROUGH THIS WINDOW,

256
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:40,788
BUT YOU'RE GONNA ACT

257
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:42,289
LIKE IT MAGICALLY
IS COMING THROUGH THAT.

258
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,724
RIGHT.

259
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,760
I DEFINITELY DO NOT THINK, BY
ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION,

260
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,795
THAT THE CAN PHONE'S
GONNA WORK.

261
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:48,796
NO WAY.

262
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,330
THESE TWO WACKOS,

263
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,600
THEY'RE JUST KIND OF SCREAMING
BACK AND FORTH AT EACH OTHER...

264
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,601
- ALL RIGHT,
TIGHTEN IT!

265
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,768
- PULL IT!

266
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,604
- AND, YOU KNOW, TOTALLY
DEFEATING THE PURPOSE

267
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,306
OF THIS CAN PHONE DESIGN
THAT THEY CAME UP WITH.

268
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:02,710
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

269
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,511
- [gasps]
SEE?

270
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:06,079
[bleep] LISTEN.
- WHAT'D SHE SAY?

271
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:07,214
- LISTEN.
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?

272
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:08,882
- LISTEN!
- I DON'T WANT TO LISTEN.

273
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,083
I DON'T WANT TO LISTEN.

274
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:12,519
- THEY'RE ARGUING.
[laughs]

275
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,788
- YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT SHE JUST SAID.

276
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,490
- YEAH, BUT WHY CAN'T YOU
LISTEN FOR YOURSELF?

277
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,827
ROGER'S GONNA TALK TO--
LISTEN!

278
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,863
MAKE SURE IT'S TIGHT.

279
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,939
- ROGER.

280
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,444
- YOU HEAR HIM TALKING IN THERE.
- I CAN ACTUALLY HEAR SOMETHING.

281
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,812
- I TOLD YOU!

282
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,514
- ROGER, DO YOU GUYS
WANT TO GO TO THE PARK?

283
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,185
- HOW THE [bleep]
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

284
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,987
- [laughing]

285
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,089
- HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

286
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,659
- I TOLD YOU!

287
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:53,260
- I CAN ACTUALLY
HEAR HIM THROUGH THERE.

288
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,195
HE JUST SAID, "ROGER, DO YOU
WANT TO GO TO THE PARK?"

289
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:56,196
- SEE?

290
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,731
- HOW THE [bleep] IS THAT--

291
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,833
AND I'M THE IDIOT.
OH, MY GOD.

292
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:03,536
I'M DONE SECOND-GUESSING YOU.

293
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,072
IF YOU TELL ME BELLA
CAN FLY TOMORROW,

294
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,073
I'M GONNA JUST BELIEVE IT.

295
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,074
- YAY.

296
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:09,777
- WHO'S THE IDIOT NOW, ROGER?

297
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:12,946
- I'M--I CONCEDE.
I'M AN IDIOT.

298
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,047
WHY DON'T WE
HAVE STRINGS

299
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,816
RUNNING ALL ACROSS
THE UNITED STATES, THEN?

300
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:16,917
- WE DO.
TELEPHONE POLES.

301
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,085
- IT'S NOT--
IT'S DIFFERENT.

302
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,486
- THEY DIDN'T
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

303
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,888
- WHY'D THEY HANG UP?

304
00:10:20,988 --> 00:10:22,222
ARE YOU GUYS
STILL THERE?

305
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,959
ARE YOU STILL THERE?

306
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,264
- HOW ANNOYING.

307
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,300
THEY'RE STRAINING TO HEAR US,
BUT NO ONE'S TALKING BACK.

308
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,334
- THEY HUNG UP.

309
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,841
[whimsical pop music playing]

310
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:48,281
*

311
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,617
- WHAT IF OUR GIRL
IS NOT PRETTY?

312
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:51,651
WHAT DO WE DO?

313
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:55,823
I DON'T THINK YOU
WOULD ADMIT IT

314
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:58,425
IF WE HAD A LITTLE BIT
OF A HOMELY BABY.

315
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,727
I WOULD ADMIT IT.

316
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,362
- I WOULD JUST BE DOING
A LOT OF NICE THINGS FOR HER.

317
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:03,797
- A LOT OF BOWS,
A LOT OF ACCESSORIES?

318
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:06,734
- A LOT OF BOWS, A LOT
OF ACCESSORIES.

319
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,368
FIX THE EYEBROWS.

320
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,838
PUT A LITTLE ROUGE
ON THE CHEEKS.

321
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,439
- I REALLY DON'T THINK
SHE'S GOING TO BE.

322
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:13,741
- I WOULD REALLY
DO THAT, THOUGH.

323
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,075
- I KNOW.

324
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,744
- BEING CUTE--
- NOBODY WANTS AN UGLY BABY.

325
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,446
- BEING CUTE IS GONNA
MAKE HER LIFE EASIER.

326
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,614
THAT'S JUST THE FACT
OF THE MATTER.

327
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,784
YOU WOULD BE WHERE YOU WERE
IF YOU WEREN'T PRETTY,

328
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,452
AND [bleep]
A LOT OF [bleep].

329
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,323
- WE ALL KNOW
I DON'T DO THAT.

330
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,391
- TRUE.

331
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:33,060
SAW MY BUDDY SCOTT
AT THE GYM TODAY.

332
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,294
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT--

333
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,295
I WAS LIKE,
"I'M GONNA BE A DADDY TODAY,

334
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,629
I'M SUPER EXCITED,"

335
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,231
AND HE WAS LIKE, "OH,
IT'S THE GREATEST THING,"

336
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,532
BUT HE SAYS,
"I GOT TO TELL YOU"--

337
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,534
HE SAID, "YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE GONNA BE HUMBLED."

338
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:43,771
HE SAID, "YOU'RE GONNA
ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS,

339
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,939
"'CAUSE EVERY GUY
THAT COMES IN THAT ROOM

340
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,775
STICKS A FINGER
IN YOUR WIFE."

341
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:50,944
HE GOES, "I SWEAR, THE SECURITY
GUY, THE GUY DELIVERING LUNCH,

342
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,479
"STUCK A FINGER
IN MY WIFE AND WAS LIKE,

343
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:55,282
'OH, YEAH,
THREE CENTIMETERS DILATED.'"

344
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,683
AND HE'S LIKE,
"EVERYBODY'S"--

345
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,585
- NOBODY'S GOING UP THERE
UNLESS HE'S DR. REZAI.

346
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,053
- THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

347
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,189
HE SAID, "EVERYBODY THAT COMES
IN IS JUST, 'PFFT.'"

348
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:03,223
- EW!

349
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,324
NO TOUCHY.

350
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,227
- OH, HEY.

351
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,063
[dogs barking]

352
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,698
JENNI'S ASKED ME
TO COME OVER

353
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,503
BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO EXPLAIN
TO ME HOW TO WATCH HER DOGS

354
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,038
WHEN SHE'S GIVING BIRTH.

355
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:20,473
AHH!

356
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,275
OH, MY GOD.
DIESEL, PLEASE.

357
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,345
- GET YOUR BALL.
THERE YOU GO.

358
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,247
AS LONG AS I'VE
KNOWN THIS BITCH,

359
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,515
SHE'S OBSESSED
WITH HER DOGS.

360
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:30,250
IT'S GONNA BE EASY
TAKING CARE OF THE DOGS.

361
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,420
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS FEED THEM,
LOVE THEM, AND WALK THEM.

362
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,455
THEY'RE DOGS.

363
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,290
- THEY'RE MY DOGS, THOUGH.

364
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,093
- YOU'RE CRAZY.

365
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:41,829
BELLA, PLEASE.

366
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,696
- SO, THE DOGGIE TO-DO LIST.

367
00:12:43,831 --> 00:12:47,267
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE WATER OUT OF
THE FILTRATION SYSTEM FOR THEM.

368
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,636
DIESEL LIKES FIVE ICE CUBES.

369
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,571
AND THEN I HAVE GROUND TURKEY,

370
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:54,574
AND IF YOU COULD JUST SAUTEE
THAT UP INTO SMALL BITES,

371
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:55,843
THEY LIKE THAT FOR DINNER.

372
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:57,277
BRUSH THEIR TEETH DAILY.

373
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,379
DIESEL NEEDS
HIS AROMATHERAPY BATH.

374
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:00,513
- IS THAT A JOKE?

375
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:01,681
- NO.

376
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,416
- SERIOUSLY?
- SERIOUSLY.

377
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,517
- SHE'S CRAZY.

378
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,053
THESE DOGS ARE VERY
HIGH-MAINTENANCE.

379
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,888
I FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T
EVEN THINK THEY'RE DOGS.

380
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,189
THEY THINK THEY'RE PEOPLE.

381
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,391
- DIESEL LOVES
HIS LEGS MASSAGED.

382
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,226
THREE WALKS A DAY.

383
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,227
- [groans]

384
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:15,362
- GIRLS NEED A MANI.

385
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,131
BELLA LOVES PINK,
NOEL LOVES PURPLE.

386
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,132
BELLA'S A DIVA.

387
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,233
SHE LOVES HER NAILS PAINTED.

388
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,702
SHE LOVES DRESS-UP.

389
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,703
- I CAN'T.

390
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:27,040
- THEY LOVE MASSAGES.

391
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,010
I DON'T SEE
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.

392
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,011
AND THAT'S REALLY IT.

393
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,745
I MEAN,
IT'S NOTHING MUCH.

394
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,114
- YOU'RE A PSYCHO.

395
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,883
- I'M NOT A PSYCHO.
- YOU'RE A CRAZY DOG LADY.

396
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:37,784
I WANT TO SHOOT MYSELF
IN THE HEAD.

397
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,686
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

398
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:40,720
- WELCOME TO MY HELL.

399
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,896
- ONE, TWO,

400
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:50,663
THREE.

401
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,802
- I GOT LORENZO A LITTLE BOUNCE
HOUSE FOR THE BACK YARD.

402
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,670
AT HOME, HE LOVED
THE TRAMPOLINE,

403
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,072
SO I THINK, YOU KNOW,
SETTING IT UP,

404
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,008
YOU KNOW, BLOWING IT UP--
HE'LL LOVE IT.

405
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,045
- WHOA!

406
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:06,914
A BOUNCE HOUSE!

407
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:07,915
WHAT?

408
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,349
WANT TO COME IN REAL QUICK?

409
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,218
- NO.
- WHY?

410
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,485
ARE YOU SCARED?

411
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:15,188
- BRING HIM IN WITH YOU.

412
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,057
- COME HERE, BABY.
- NO.

413
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:19,659
- JUST TAKE HIM!
- I'M TRYING.

414
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,829
- [whines]
- HE DOESN'T WANT TO.

415
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,065
- IF HE GOES IN WITH YOU,
HE'LL HAVE FUN.

416
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,699
- NO!
MAMA.

417
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,001
- HE'S TERRIFIED.

418
00:14:28,101 --> 00:14:29,836
- [crying]

419
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:33,340
- JUST TRY IT.

420
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,978
JUST TRY IT WITH MOM.

421
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,679
GO IN WITH HIM.

422
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,680
GO IN WITH HIM.
HURRY.

423
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,848
- THERE YOU GO.
- THERE YOU GO.

424
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,284
GO, NICOLE.
- MOMMY'S COMING.

425
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,353
MOMMY'S COMING.

426
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:49,189
WHEE!
- MAMA!

427
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,423
- CAN YOU GIVE ME THE BALL?

428
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,492
- LORENZO, GO GET THE BALL.

429
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,063
- THAT'S SUCH A FAKE CRY.

430
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:58,365
- I JUST FEEL LIKE HE NEEDS
TO GET USED TO THINGS,

431
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:02,035
AND GET,
YOU KNOW, ACCLIMATED.

432
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:04,104
MY MOM TAUGHT ME
THAT WORD.

433
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,138
- ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.

434
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:08,976
- HEY, GO DOWN THE SLIDE.

435
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,544
- NO!
I DON'T WANT TO.

436
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,413
- WHOA!
- WHEE!

437
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:16,883
both:
YAY!

438
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:21,989
- LORENZO?

439
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,523
- IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

440
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:24,992
IT'S OKAY.

441
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:28,261
WHEE!
- NO.

442
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,637
- HOW YOU DOING, BABE?

443
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:38,871
- SHE'S GONNA FALL OUT.

444
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,873
- ROGER AND I ARE
AT THE DOCTOR'S TODAY

445
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,442
TO GET OUR LAST ULTRASOUND,

446
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,843
AND IF SHE'S BIG ENOUGH,

447
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,246
WE'RE GONNA SCHEDULE
AN INDUCTION.

448
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,648
- ALL RIGHT.
THERE'S BABY'S HEAD.

449
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,117
GOOD-SIZED HEAD.

450
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:54,387
LET'S GET AN IDEA APPROXIMATELY
WHAT SIZE THIS BABY IS.

451
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:59,559
THIS WAY WE CAN TELL DR. REZAI
AND SEE HOW IT ALL TURNS OUT.

452
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:03,896
APPROXIMATELY EIGHT POUNDS,
TWO OUNCES RIGHT NOW,

453
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:06,199
GIVE OR TAKE
ABOUT A POUND.

454
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,401
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THE HEART,
'CAUSE THERE'S THE HEART.

455
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:10,803
YOU SEE IT BEATING RIGHT THERE?
- YEAH.

456
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,244
- WE MADE THAT
LITTLE HEARTBEAT.

457
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,712
- I KNOW.
- 144 BEATS PER MINUTE.

458
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,813
- OH, SHE'S SO PERFECT.

459
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:23,616
- SO EVERYTHING
LOOKS GREAT.

460
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,952
I THINK WE'RE PRETTY CLOSE.

461
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,354
I'LL GO TALK
TO DR. REZAI,

462
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,955
AND I'LL BE BACK
IN JUST A COUPLE MINUTES.

463
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,057
- OKAY, GREAT.

464
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:31,058

- IT'S VERY SURREAL RIGHT NOW

466
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,961
TO THINK THAT NOW WE'RE
GONNA BE A FAMILY OF THREE.

467
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:37,730
IT'S SO CRAZY
THAT THERE'S GONNA BE

468
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,733
A COMBO OF
US IN THIS WORLD,

469
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,202
AND IN THIS HOUSE,

GET HER OUT.

487
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,510
I'M SCARED.
I'LL BE HONEST.

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,246
LIKE, I'M SUPER EXCITED.

489
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,880
I JUST WANT
MY DAUGHTER HERE.

LET ME TELL YOU.

491
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,883
I'M SUPER EXCITED.

492
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,685
- BUT REALITY SET IN,

493
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,621
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS
LABOR'S GONNA HAPPEN.

494
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,756
WHAT IF I'M NOT A GOOD MOM,

495
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,425
OR WHAT IF I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO SOMETHING?

496
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:40,960
LIKE, IT'S JUST ALL THOSE
BILLION QUESTIONS

497
00:17:41,128 --> 00:17:43,263

I HAVE FIGHTING DOGS, PER USUAL.

506
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,851
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

507
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,386

512
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,564

A LITTLE MORE EXCITED THAN THAT.

513
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:20,667
- OH. WHEE!

514
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:21,801

00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:31,611
- THANK YOU.
I LOVE YOU.

520
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,979
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

521
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,085
OH! YEAH.
I DO HAVE ONE.

522
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,087
- THERE YOU GO.

523
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,522
THAT'S A STERILIZER?

524
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:46,193
BRR.
BRR, IT'S COLD IN HERE.

525
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,094
FREEZING.
- THE [bleep]?

526
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,796
- I DON'T KNOW.

527
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:51,998
IT WORKS.

528
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:53,333
WELL, THERE'S THIS STERILIZER

529
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,934
THAT YOU CAN USE
FOR THE BOTTLES--

530
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:56,669
- DOES IT GET TIRING?
- UM, YEAH.

531
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,938
- LORENZO'S STILL
ON THE BOTTLE, NO?

532
00:18:59,038 --> 00:18:59,939
- SHUT UP!

533
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:01,474
- WHAT?
BUT I'M SAYING, LIKE--

534
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,576
I STILL DON'T STERILIZE IT.
HE CAN EAT HIS OWN BOOGERS.

535
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:04,577
I DON'T CARE.
- OH.

536
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:05,745
WHAT ELSE
DO I NEED?

537
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,714
- I DON'T REMEMBER.
I'M PREGNANT.

538
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,449
- SO AM I.

539
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,284
YOU'RE PREGNANT
WITH SATAN.

540
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,286
- YOU'RE PREGNANT
WITH A STRIPPER.

541
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:16,689
WHAT'S A HEMORRHOID FEEL LIKE?
- ITCHY.

542
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,858
LIKE, ANNOYING.
- OH.

543
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,560
- IT DOESN'T HURT, REALLY.

544
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,994
IT'S NOT EVEN ITCHY.
IT FEELS LIKE--

545
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,663
- MY BUTTHOLE HURTS.
- YEAH.

546
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,966
- BUT THERE'S NOTHING THERE.
THERE'S NO, LIKE, BUMPS.

547
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,735
- SO MAYBE YOU'RE JUST--

548
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,937
- MADE IT SORE.
- FROM STRAINING?

549
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,872
I DIDN'T DO
ANY BUTT SEX.

550
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,674
- NO, I'M JUST SAYING,
FROM STRAINING.

551
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,042
I DON'T STRAIN.

552
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,544
I TAKE THESE GREAT PRENATALS

553
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,980
THAT DON'T MAKE ME
HAVE THAT ISSUE.

554
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,250
THIS IS PREGNANCY PROBLEMS
NOBODY TELLS YOU ABOUT.

555
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:44,251
- YEAH.

556
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:45,852
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET TO WORK.

557
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,487
- I DON'T SPEAK SPANISH.

558
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,988
- WHY'S THIS IN SPANISH?

559
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,423
- YOURS TOO?

560
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,891
- AY-YI-YI.

561
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,861
- I'M SO HAPPY THAT NICOLE'S
HELPING ME WITH THE BABY

562
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,063
AND GETTING EVERYTHING READY.

563
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:58,097
- IS THIS THE TOP?

564
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,466
- I THINK IT GOES LIKE THAT.

565
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,602
- YOU SURE?
- NO.

566
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,971
- I FEEL LIKE THIS
IS VERY COMPLICATED.

567
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:06,373
- SOME OF THESE ARE.

568
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:07,807
THIS LOOKS
LIKE A UFO.

569
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,277
- I'M CONFUSED.

570
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,812
THIS ONE'S WAY
TOO COMPLICATED FOR ME.

571
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:14,581
- I GUESS SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL TO DO,

572
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:16,949
AND I'M JUST LIKE,
MY POOR DAUGHTER.

573
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,951
HER FIRST WEEK OF LIFE
IS GONNA BE HELL.

574
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,620
- THIS IS A GOOD ONE.

575
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,623
- YEAH.
I HAVE IT IN PINK, TOO.

576
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,525
- DID YOU TRY IT ON?
- YEAH.

577
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:29,161
- YOU'LL SEE, LIKE--
YOUR BREAST MILK SMELLS BAD.

578
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,030
- OH, IT'S TERRIBLE.
- LIKE, IT STAINS.

579
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:34,000
IT SMELLS LIKE
COTTAGE CHEESE.

580
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,102
- EVERYTHING TO YOU
SMELLS LIKE COTTAGE CHEESE.

581
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,637
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

582
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,339
YEAST INFECTIONS...

583
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:40,540
- WELL, I THINK
COTTAGE CHEESE SMELLS BAD.

584
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,541
THAT'S WHY I SAY IT.

585
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,310
I'M LIKE, EW.
- MM-HMM.

586
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,845
- BREAST MILK
DOES NOT SMELL GOOD.

587
00:20:45,945 --> 00:20:47,046
- MY BUTTHOLE HURTS.

588
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,749
- SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

589
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,618
- MAYBE 'CAUSE I'M CONSTIPATED.

590
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,158
- I'M TAKING ROGER TO GET HIM
SOME VICTORY CIGARS

591
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,560
FOR WHEN MEILANI'S BORN.

592
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,994
WE COULD GO OUT BACK,
YOU KNOW,

593
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,330
WE COULD GO
AT THE HOSPITAL.

594
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,332
- DO YOU REALLY CONSIDER IT
A VICTORY HAVING A BABY,

595
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,734
OR IS IT
A CELEBRATORY CIGAR?

596
00:21:07,834 --> 00:21:09,001
- BOTH.
- IT'S A VICTORY?

597
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,203
- VICTORY.
CELEBRATORY.

598
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,939
- [laughs]

599
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,942
"CELIBATORY?"

600
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,244
- EITHER WAY, I'M GONNA
GET SOME ROGER CIGARS.

601
00:21:18,345 --> 00:21:22,214
WE'RE GONNA SMOKE THEM
AFTER MEILANI'S BORN.

602
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:25,184
- I WOULD LIKE TO BUY
SOME CELEBRATORY CIGARS,

603
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:27,354
'CAUSE I'M GONNA BE A DAD HERE
IN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS.

604
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,590
- I'D LIKE
A MACANUDO, ROMEO...

605
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,359
- LIKE A ROMEO AND JULIETA?
- YEAH. THEY'RE PRETTY--

606
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,726
- I WOULD TRY A RESERVE.

607
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:38,431
- I PROBABLY WOULD CONSIDER
MYSELF A CIGAR 'FICIONADO.

608
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:40,232
- "FISH-CIONADO"?

609
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,369
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE [bleep] WORD IS.

610
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,904
- "A-FICIONADO."

611
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,740
NOT "FISH-CIONADO."
- AFICIONADO!

612
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,175
E-FICIONADO?

613
00:21:49,275 --> 00:21:51,378
- THE NUBS ARE ALSO
A REALLY GREAT CIGAR.

614
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,680
THEY LOOK LITTLE, BUT THEY
BURN FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

615
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,382
IT'S A VERY GOOD ROLL.

616
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:56,816
BUT IT'S--YEAH,
IT'S A REALLY GOOD--

617
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,250
IT'S, LIKE,
PACKED REALLY TIGHT.

618
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,252
- THAT'S WHAT JIONNI LOOKS LIKE
WITH HIS PANTS OFF.

619
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:02,855
- I WAS WAITING FOR IT.

620
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:03,956
I SET HIM UP FOR IT.

621
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,293
- SO IT'S JENNI AND ROGER'S
LAST NIGHT OF FREEDOM

622
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:08,561
BEFORE THEY HAVE THE BABY.

623
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,863
- LET'S DO SOMETHING.
- WE GOT TO CELEBRATE.

624
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:14,401
WE GOT TO PARTY IT UP
BEFORE THEY'RE PARENTS.

625
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,068
- YEAH.
AFTER THIS, IT'S DONE.

626
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,269
- IT'S DONEZO.

627
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:19,572
- THEY'RE DONE.
- LET'S GO.

628
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,974
- CARLY IS THE BABYSITTER
FOR THE SUMMER,

629
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,677
AND I NEED HER TO COME
OVER TO WATCH LORENZO.

630
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:25,945
- YOU GONNA GO
NIGHT NIGHT?

631
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:26,946
- NO.

632
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,115
- WITH YOUR BLANKET
AND YOUR BA-BA?

633
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:31,150
- NO!

634
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,919
- I'LL GET THE NAPKINS.

635
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,423

00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:38,290
POP BOTTLES!

637
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:39,492
[imitates wolf howling]

638
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,493
- WHAT'S UP, NEIGHBOR?

639
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:41,994
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

640
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,563
- RELAXING.
- RELAXING?

641
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:45,798
- IT'S YOUR LAST NIGHT
OF FREEDOM.

642
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,167
- SCREW THAT [bleep].
WE'RE COMING OVER.

643
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,169
- PARTY'S HERE!

644
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,938
- EW!
SHUT UP, ROGER!

645
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:56,042
- CONGRATULATIONS,
JENNI AND ROGER.

646
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,444
- YEAH!

647
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,847
YAY!

648
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:03,082
- THAT HIT THE FENCE, BRO.
THAT WAS A GOOD SHOT.

649
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,484
- TO JENNI AND ROGER.

650
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:05,618
- CHEERS TO NEW PARENTS.

651
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,220

652
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,456
- THANKS, GUYS.

653
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,491
- THIS MADE OUR NIGHT.
- WHOO!

654
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:12,892
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE YOUR SHIRT.

655
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:14,994
THAT'S CUTE.
BEST DAD EVER.

656
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,195
- JENNI BOUGHT IT FOR ME.

657
00:23:16,295 --> 00:23:17,464
- YOU'RE CUTE.

658
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,365
- TELL YOU WHAT, GUYS,
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

659
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,767
AND YOU'RE GONNA
BE GREAT PARENTS.

660
00:23:20,867 --> 00:23:22,535
- MM-HMM.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

661
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:24,804
- 'CAUSE WE KNOW.
- 'CAUSE I KNOW.

662
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:26,839
- I JUST WANT
TO WATCH HER BY MYSELF.

663
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,675
- WELL YOU ARE GONNA BE
THE GODMOTHER, CORRECT?

664
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:29,676
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

665
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,310
- WHO'S THE GODFATHER?

666
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:34,346
- I HONESTLY DO NOT KNOW YET,
BUT I THINK MY FRIEND LOUIE.

667
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:35,515
- [clears throat]

668
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:38,485
HE HAS TWO GIRLS.
HE'S PROBABLY--

669
00:23:38,551 --> 00:23:42,489
OH!
[all laughing]

670
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:45,492
WILL YOU PROMISE ME ONE THING?

671
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,826
- I'M NOT LOOKING
AT THE PLACENTA.

672
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,227
- PLEASE? PLEASE.
- JUST LOOK AT IT.

673
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,696
- NO!
- IT'S SO LONG.

674
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:51,197
YOU'RE LIKE,
"THAT WAS IN ME?"

675
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,699
IT'S HUGE.

676
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,701
- IT'S NOT EVEN THAT,
IT'S THE BLOOD THAT COMES OUT.

677
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,035
THEY PUT A BUCKET
UNDER HER LEGS

678
00:23:56,135 --> 00:24:00,239
FOR THE GALLONS OF BLOOD
THAT COMES OUT.

679
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,408
- GALLONS?
- GALLONS OF BLOOD.

680
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:04,143
HE PUT HIM--
THE BABY'S COMING OUT,

681
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,612
HE'S WEARING
HIS REGULAR CLOTHES.

682
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:07,880
PLACENTA COMES OUT,
HE PUTS A BIG SMOCK ON.

683
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,015
I'M NOT KIDDING.

684
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,583
HE PUT THE SMOCK ON
BEFORE THE PLACENTA,

685
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:11,951
NOT THE BABY.

686
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:13,319
- YOU STILL TALK ABOUT THIS.

687
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:15,822
YOU'RE HAUNTED BY IT
AND YOU WANT ME TO LOOK AT IT.

688
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:19,158
YOU TALK ABOUT IT
LIKE YOU DID TIME IN IRAQ,

689
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,392
AND YOU WANT ME
TO LOOK AT IT.

690
00:24:20,527 --> 00:24:21,661
- I'M BEGGING YOU.

691
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,262
- EVERYTHING YOU DESCRIBED,
WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND

692
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:24,531
WOULD WANT TO SEE THAT?

693
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,599
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING
OUT OF THE MOVIE ALIENS.

694
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,834
- WATCH IT.

695
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,435
- I'M GONNA WEAR
A WELDER'S MASK IN THERE.

696
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,303
- TO THE PLACENTA!

697
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,339
- LOOK AT THE PLACENTA.
- I AM NOT CHEERING FOR THAT.

698
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,373
- GOOD TIMES.

699
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:49,889
- HOW ARE YOU
FEELING THIS MORNING?

700
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,323
- I'M NOT SCARED.

701
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:54,326
"SCARED" REMINDS ME OF, LIKE,
SCARED OF ALLIGATORS AND STUFF,

702
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,562
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

703
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,597
LIKE I'M SCARED OF THE DARK,
OR BURGLARS.

704
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:00,099
- TODAY IS THE DAY.
- AND I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

705
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:02,769
UM, WE'VE BEEN WAITING
39 WEEKS FOR TODAY.

706
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,871
- I'VE BEEN WAITING
39 YEARS FOR TODAY.

707
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:06,706
- AW, HOW CUTE IS THAT?

708
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:08,107
39 WEEKS
AND 39 YEARS.

709
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:12,444
I THINK SHE'S JUST
GONNA DESTROY ME COMING OUT,

710
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:15,114
BUT THAT'S FINE.

711
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:16,749
- IT'S GONNA BE
LIKE COLLEGE FOR YOU.

712
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,884
- YEAH.

713
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,185
IT'S LIKE THAT
FOOTBALL TEAM I TOOK ON.

714
00:25:19,285 --> 00:25:20,386
- LIKE A CHAMPION,
I MIGHT ADD.

715
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:22,021
A CHAMPION.

716
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:23,322
- NO, BUT SERIOUSLY.

717
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,691
IS IT WEIRD THAT I'M, LIKE,

718
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:27,393
SO CURIOUS TO FIND OUT
WHAT THAT PAIN'S LIKE?

719
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:29,962
I'M KIND OF LIKE,
"I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S UP."

720
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:31,764
- YOU'RE GONNA GET
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.

721
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,099
- I DON'T WANT
TO POOP ON THE TABLE.

722
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,434
- [sighs]

723
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:37,303
- THIS ISN'T HELPING.
- [laughs]

724
00:25:37,403 --> 00:25:38,705
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA DO YOUR ENEMA THING

725
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:40,006
BEFORE YOU GO IN.

726
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:41,974
- YEAH, BUT WE'RE
NOT GOING IN FOR NINE HOURS.

727
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,811
I STILL WANT TO EAT THEN.
I GOT TO HAVE SOME STRENGTH.

728
00:25:44,911 --> 00:25:46,078
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
POOP ON THE TABLE, MAN?

729
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,313
WHAT'S UP?

730
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,015
LIKE, WE'LL GET THE POWER WASHER
OUT OF THE SHED,

731
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,049
JUST IN CASE
IT HAPPENS.

732
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,995
[line ringing]

733
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:05,665
- HEY, BOO.

734
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:07,066
- HI.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

735
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:08,534
- GETTING READY FOR YOU.

736
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:09,836
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

737
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,771
- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE,
WHEN I COME TO GET YOU,

738
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:12,905
THAT YOU'RE READY,

739
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,341
BECAUSE YOU NEED
TO LOOK PRETTY FOR YOUR BABY

740
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:16,843
BEFORE YOU GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

741
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:18,645
- I AM ACTUALLY ALL READY,
AND IT'S PERFECT,

742
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,046
'CAUSE I DIDN'T
WASH MY HAIR TODAY,

743
00:26:20,146 --> 00:26:21,648
SO I'M SUPER EXCITED.

744
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:23,382
- I'LL BE THERE
IN AN HOUR.

745
00:26:23,482 --> 00:26:25,652
- BITCH.

746
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:26,986
- I'M JUST KIDDING.
- LOVE YOU, BYE.

747
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,020
- 'KAY.
LOVE YOU, BYE.

748
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:31,457
'KAY.

749
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:32,759
WILL YOU COME
OVER THERE WITH ME?

750
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:34,126
I WANT TO TAKE MY PICTURE,
'CAUSE I WANT TO TAKE--

751
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,127
- ALL RIGHT.

752
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,663
- I WANT TO TAKE
A PICTURE OF OUR BELLIES

753
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:37,697
BEFORE SHE GIVES BIRTH.

754
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,365
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DRIVE.

755
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:40,867
- YOU'RE DRIVING?
- YEAH.

756
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:43,469
- ALL THE WAY OVER?
- I CAN'T WALK IN THESE HEELS.

757
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,371
[car horn honking]

758
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:56,548
- OH, MY GOD, I LOVE THIS SIGN
THAT NICOLE MADE FOR THE PHOTOS.

759
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,084
I REALLY HOPE THAT THEY'RE
GONNA BE BEST FRIENDS.

760
00:26:58,184 --> 00:26:59,085
'CAUSE IF THEY'RE
NOT BEST FRIENDS

761
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,086
AND THEY HATE EACH OTHER--

762
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,287
- IT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM,

763
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:02,554
BECAUSE WE'RE
HANGING OUT ALL THE TIME.

764
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:03,690
THEY'RE GONNA BE
LIKE US.

765
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:04,857
- YEAH.
- BECAUSE THEY'RE OUR KIDS.

766
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,058
THEY'RE GONNA BE
JUST LIKE US,

767
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,860
AND THEY'RE GONNA
LIKE EACH OTHER.

768
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,461
- YEAH.

769
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,597
IT'LL REALLY PISS ME OFF IF OUR
DAUGHTERS AREN'T BEST FRIENDS.

770
00:27:11,698 --> 00:27:12,965
- I'LL MAKE THEM BEST FRIENDS.
- ME TOO.

771
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,400
- LIKE, "YOU BETTER LIKE HER."

772
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,369
WHAT?
- [laughing]

773
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,504
- WHAT?

774
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:21,440
- YOUR WHITE PART OF YOUR BOOBS
ARE, LIKE--

775
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,309
- MY WHAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

776
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:24,610
- MY AREOLA?

777
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:26,478
- [laughs]

778
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,986
- LET'S GET BEAUTIFUL.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

779
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,454
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M WEARING HEELS.

780
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:38,090
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK
PRETTY ON YOUR DELIVERY DAY,

781
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,959
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
WANT YOUR BABY COMING OUT,

782
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,528
AND THEN YOUR BABY'S LIKE,
"EW, THAT'S MY MOM?"

783
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:43,830
- LISTEN.

784
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,097
BEING NINE MONTHS PREGNANT,

785
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,499
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
I DON'T DO ANYMORE.

786
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:50,136
YOU'RE LUCKY I SHOWER.

787
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:51,303
- SHAVE YOUR VAGINA.

788
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,572
- UGH. THAT'S...
- CAN YOU SEE IT?

789
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,307
- NO.
- [laughs] "CAN YOU SEE IT?"

790
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,810
- SHAVING AT THIS POINT
IS A GUESSING GAME.

791
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,978
I CAN'T LIFT THE LEG.
LIKE...

792
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,913
AND THEN YOU BEND DOWN,
YOU CAN'T BREATHE.

793
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,081
- YEAH.

794
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,750
THEN YOU TRY AND,
LIKE, MOVE YOUR STOMACH

795
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:05,251
AND PUSH IT IN SO YOU
CAN SEE YOUR VAGINA.

796
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,352
- OH, IT'S SO PAINFUL.

797
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:07,954
- BUT YOU CAN'T,
SO YOU JUST GOTTA...

798
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:09,388
- GUESS.

799
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,390
- FEEL IT AND MAKE SURE YOU
DON'T SNIP SOMETHING OFF.

800
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,825
- IF YOU GET A MIRROR--
- GET IT WAXED.

801
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,093
[Snooki and Jwoww gag]

802
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,361
SO WHAT ABOUT AFTER BIRTH?

803
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:16,796
HOW LONG DO YOU
WAIT TO SHAVE?

804
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:20,632
- I HAD A LITTLE FOREST,
A LITTLE BIT.

805
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,234
VAGINAS ARE HARD
TO MAINTAIN.

806
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,970
AND THEY'RE GROSS.

807
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,971
VAGINAS ARE GROSS.

808
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:26,072
- THEY'RE NOT A FLOWER.

809
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,606
- I SHOULD JUST
HAVE A PENIS AND JUST...

810
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:30,676
- SMACK [bleep] ALL DAY?
[laughing

811
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:32,211
- WE'RE AWFUL.

812
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:37,784
I THINK I'M MORE NERVOUS
THAN YOU ARE.

813
00:28:37,817 --> 00:28:38,785
- ARE YOU GONNA
JUST PULL IT OUT?

814
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:40,119
- NO, I'M NOT
PULLING NO CORD--

815
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:41,620
- ARE YOU GONNA TOUCH THE HEAD
WHEN THEY WANT YOU TO?

816
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:42,989
- NO!

817
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,490
- LORENZO'S HEAD WAS HALFWAY
OUT, THEY'RE LIKE,

818
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,557
"FEEL HIM! FEEL HIM!"

819
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,626
I'M LIKE, "NO!
JUST GET HIM OUT!"

820
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,796
I'M NOT GONNA GO THERE.
- I DON'T WANT TO FEEL THAT.

821
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,630
NO.
JUST GET HIM OUT.

822
00:28:51,798 --> 00:28:53,332
'CAUSE HE'S HALFWAY
OUT OF MY VAGINA--

823
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:54,600
WHY AM I GONNA JUST
LET HIM HANG THERE AND--

824
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,601
- JUST LIKE THIS?

825
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:57,103
- YEAH, FEEL HIS HEAD.

826
00:28:57,203 --> 00:28:59,171
- THAT'S, LIKE, JUST AS BAD AS,
LIKE, "DO YOU WANT A MIRROR?"

827
00:28:59,271 --> 00:29:00,572
NO, MOTHER[bleep],
I DON'T WANT A MIRROR.

828
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:02,641
- YEAH. JUST GET MY BABY OUT.
- GET IT OUT.

829
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:03,910
- JEEZ.

830
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,044
- I COULDN'T SLEEP.

831
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,578
- COULDN'T SLEEP WORTH--

832
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,215
I SHUT THE TV OFF
AT, LIKE, ONE.

833
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:12,819
AND THEN I COUNTED--

834
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,620
- WHY COULDN'T YOU SLEEP?
YOU'RE JUST EXCITED?

835
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,056
- NO, I JUST PEE
EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

836
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,257
- [laughs]
AW.

837
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:19,258
- * HERE WE GO

838
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:20,927
* AND IT'S JUST
THE BEGINNING *

839
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:22,094
* YEAH,
YOU AND ME *

840
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:23,662
* WE'RE SPINNING

841
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,132
* THROUGH
A CO-O-OLORFUL WORLD *

842
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:28,234
* THROUGH A CO-O-OLORFUL
WORLD *

843
00:29:28,334 --> 00:29:29,902
* YEAH
HERE WE GO *

844
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,570
* A COLORFUL WORLD

845
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,040
* THROUGH
A CO-O-OLORFUL WORLD *

846
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,042
- YOU READY, BABE?
TIME TO GO.

847
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:37,243
- I'M READY.

848
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:38,644
ARE YOU READY?
- YEAH.

849
00:29:38,744 --> 00:29:42,081
I'LL GO PACK THE CAR.
IS THE KEYS ON THE COUNTER?

850
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:43,149
- YEAH.

851
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:48,620
- [sighs]
HER PERFECT LITTLE ROOM.

852
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:52,424
IT'S THE PRETTIEST ROOM
IN THE WORLD.

853
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:57,196
WITH THE PRETTIEST COLORS.

854
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,640
THE NEXT TIME I COME HOME,
YOU'LL BE HERE WITH ME.

855
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,609
IN THIS GLIDER.

856
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,644
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO NERVOUS.

857
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,291
- CAR'S ALL PACKED.

858
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:26,758
- I'M NERVOUS.

859
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,627
IT JUST HIT ME.
IT'S 8:00.

860
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,029
- YEAH.

861
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,464
IT'S A GOOD THING.
LET'S GO GET OUR BABY GIRL.

862
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,100
- I GUESS SO, RIGHT?

863
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,036
- THERE'S NO TIME
LIKE THE PRESENT.

864
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:39,906
- I'M SCARED.
NERVOUS.

865
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,574
- YOU'LL BE FINE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

866
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,011
I THINK THE REALIZATION THAT,
YOU KNOW, TODAY'S THE DAY

867
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:46,312
IS REALLY SETTING IN FOR JENNI.

868
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,314
SHE IS SCARED.
SHE'S SCARED OUT OF HER MIND.

869
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:50,349
AND, EVEN FOR ME,
IT'S A LITTLE SURREAL.

870
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,618
YOU KNOW, I'M THE GUY THAT'S
ALWAYS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING,

871
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:56,989
AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
THAT I'M 100% READY.

872
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,892
I'M AS READY AS I CAN BE, AND I
NEED TO BE HER ROCK RIGHT NOW.

873
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,065
- PROMISE TO TEXT ME.
- I WILL.

874
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:08,600
- GIVE A KISS.
- POUND. KISS.

875
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,936
I LOVE YOU.

876
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:11,503
- GOOD LUCK, ALL RIGHT?

877
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:12,704
- YEAH.
BYE.

878
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,273
- GOOD LUCK, ROGER.
I'M REALLY NERVOUS.

879
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,942
- WE'LL SEE YOU GUYS
REALLY SOON, OKAY?

880
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:16,943
TOMORROW?

881
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:17,944
- OKAY.
OH, BABY.

882
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:18,945
- IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

883
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,581
- BABY.
- BABY.

884
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,616
YOU'LL SEE
A BABY SOON.

885
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,818
- BYE, BABY.
- BYE, BABY.

886
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:42,969
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?

887
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:48,140
- I FEEL COMPLETELY FINE, LIKE
THIS IS GONNA BE EASY PEASY.

888
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,675
- OPEN IT IN THE BACK,
SO THE BUTT'S OUT?

889
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:50,977
- RIGHT.
- OKAY.

890
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:53,512
- THAT'S WHAT GOT US
INTO THIS PREDICAMENT.

891
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:56,282
- SO I'LL PUT EVERYTHING
IN THERE FOR YOU AND, UM,

892
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:57,984
GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

893
00:31:58,084 --> 00:31:59,751
- OKAY.
I'M NERVOUS.

894
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:04,623
IT'S VERY HARD TO EXPLAIN
THE FEAR OF HAVING A CHILD.

895
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,258
IT'S SCARY.

896
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:08,427
- SO, WHAT I'M GONNA DO--WE'RE
GONNA PUT THE MONITOR ON YOU,

897
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:09,728
I'M GONNA START
AN IV IN YOUR ARM.

898
00:32:09,828 --> 00:32:10,729
- IT'S GETTING MORE REAL.

899
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,198
LIKE, WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT,

900
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,766
I'M GONNA BE PUSHING MY DAUGHTER
OUT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS.

901
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,035
- WE'RE GONNA START
THE INDUCTION,

902
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:17,503
THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT THAT
MEDICATION INSIDE.

903
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:18,870
THAT HELPS
SOFTEN UP THAT CERVIX.

904
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,472
IT'S GONNA STAY THERE
TILL TOMORROW MORNING.

905
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,008
YOU'LL WANT TO GET
GOOD REST.

906
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:25,477
- DR. REZAI IS EXPLAINING THAT
HE'S GONNA STICK CERVIDIL IN ME,

907
00:32:25,577 --> 00:32:28,547
WHICH WILL SOFTEN THE CERVIX
AND GET IT READY FOR DILATION.

908
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:31,283
BY TOMORROW,
SHE'S HERE.

909
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:32,618
CRAZY.

910
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:34,786
- AND PAIN MANAGEMENT'S
COMPLETELY UP TO YOU.

911
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,488
SO WHATEVER YOU WANT
FOR PAIN, YOU CAN HAVE.

912
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,756
- I WANT TO FEEL THESE THINGS.

913
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:38,757
- ALL RIGHT.

914
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:40,859
- JUST BECAUSE I'M SO CURIOUS.

915
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:43,062
I WOULD LOVE TO FEEL
MY FIRST LABOR PAIN.

916
00:32:43,162 --> 00:32:44,330
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

917
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,831
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
BEING A WOMAN

918
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,033
AND HAVING TO EXPERIENCE THAT.

919
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,367
- AND THAT'S WHAT WE
WANT YOU TO DO.

920
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,868
WE WANT YOU TO,
YOU KNOW--

921
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:52,371
WHEN YOU START THE CONTRACTIONS,
JUST COMMUNICATE THAT WITH US.

922
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,905
SEE HOW UNCOMFORTABLE THEY ARE.

923
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,342
WE'LL CHECK YOUR CERVIX
TO SEE WHERE YOU ARE AND,

924
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,144
YOU KNOW, WHAT YOUR
OPTIONS ARE AT THAT TIME.

925
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:03,849
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

926
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,317
- THESE CRAMPS
ARE A MOTHER[bleep],

927
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:06,785
I'M GONNA BE HONEST.

928
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,920
WHATEVER THEY PUT IN MY VAGINA
IS REALLY MAKING ME CRAMP UP.

929
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:10,489
- BABE, THE GUY
WAS ELBOW-DEEP UP THERE.

930
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:12,824
THAT'S GOT TO BE
UNCOMFORTABLE IN ITSELF.

931
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,193
HE SHOOK HANDS
WITH OUR DAUGHTER

932
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:16,695
AND THEN DID
A DENTAL EXAM AFTER THAT.

933
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:19,631
- HONESTLY,
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

934
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:22,434
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE--
I FEEL OPEN.

935
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:23,702
- HER TEETH FEEL CLEAN?

936
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,937
[laughter]

937
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:29,241
- [exhales]

938
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:31,643
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
WE'RE ABOUT TO GET INTO.

939
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,812
I'M GONNA BE STRAIGHT-UP.

940
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,814
NO IDEA.

941
00:33:35,914 --> 00:33:38,750
- WE'RE ABOUT TO BECOME PARENTS
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

942
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,087
- I CAN'T WAIT FOR MEILANI.
- I CAN'T WAIT, NO.

943
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,123
- I MEAN, SHE'S GONNA BE HERE
IN, LIKE, EIGHT HOURS.

944
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:46,592
- MAYBE SOONER.
- SOONER, LATER. WHO CARES?

945
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,194
SHE'LL BE HERE
WITHIN THE NEXT 24.

946
00:33:48,294 --> 00:33:50,662
- MM-HMM.

947
00:33:50,762 --> 00:33:53,499
- IT IS INSANE TO ME
THAT, IN THE MORNING,

948
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:56,202
I WILL BE ONE STEP CLOSER
TO BEING A PARENT.

949
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:59,138
EVERY DAY, I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR RIGHT NOW, THIS MOMENT.

950
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:01,773
BUT NOW THAT THIS MOMENT
IS HERE, I'M FREAKING OUT

951
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,409
AND I STILL
CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

952
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,111
CAN YOU TUCK ME IN?

953
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:06,278
- I LOVE YOU.

954
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,280
- I LOVE YOU TOO.
- I'M PROUD OF YOU.

955
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,881
NO WAY I'M GONNA
FIT ON THIS THING.

956
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,821
- I'M TIRED.

957
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,156
TRYING TO MAKE
A BABY IS HARD WORK.

958
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:19,125
- HEH!

959
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:28,700
- [groans]
IT HURTS.

960
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,569
OW.

961
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,271
- WELL, WHEN YOU KEPT
SAYING, "I WANT TO KNOW

962
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,972
WHAT A CONTRACTION IS"--

963
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,308
NOW YOU KNOW.
- OW.

964
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,710
- YOU'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF IT, AND THAT'S GOOD,

965
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:43,014
'CAUSE IT MEANS IT'S HALFWAY
OVER AND IT'S GONNA GO AWAY.

966
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:47,353
- POOP. IT'S LONG.
- IT IS A LONG ONE.

967
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:49,155
IT'S ON ITS WAY DOWN NOW.

968
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,628
- MY VAGINA'S GONNA FALL OUT.

969
00:34:58,564 --> 00:34:59,465
OUCH.

970
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:01,233
OH, MY GOD,
I'M GONNA DIE.

971
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,801
OH, MY GOD.

972
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:05,070
THE CONTRACTIONS
ARE GETTING REALLY PAINFUL.

973
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:06,872
AND I HONESTLY FEEL
LIKE I'M IN A HORROR MOVIE.

974
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,375
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I'M
IN THE [bleep] TWILIGHT ZONE,

975
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,977
BECAUSE THIS IS [bleep]
EXCRUCIATING.

976
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:13,912
IT FEELS LIKE SOMEONE
IS TAKING MY INTESTINES

977
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:15,814
AND TRYING TO PULL THEM
OUT OF MY ASS[bleep].

978
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:17,183
YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE,
OH, MY GOD,

979
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,451
I'M, LIKE, HONESTLY
RETHINKING THIS EPIDURAL.

980
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,493
I'M NOT KIDDING. I NEED HELP.

981
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:28,960
- ALL RIGHT.

982
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,529
- OW.

983
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:31,763
- YOU'RE OKAY.

984
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:34,800
- OW.

985
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,235
- BREATHE.

986
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,103
- WHERE THE [bleep]
IS MY DOCTOR?

987
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:41,607
OH, MY GOD.

988
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:43,975
- BREATHE.

989
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,977
- SHE'S TOO BIG.
SHE'S GONNA KILL ME.

990
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,614
SERIOUSLY, MY VAGINA'S
GONNA FALL OUT OF MY ASS[bleep].

991
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,549
I FELT A CONTRACTION.
I'M GOOD.

992
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,950
I CAN'T TAKE
THIS PAIN ANYMORE.

993
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,619
I'VE DECIDED
I NEED AN EPIDURAL.

994
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,787
SO MY ANESTHESIOLOGIST COMES IN.

995
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:58,224
THANK YOU, JESUS,
BECAUSE IT'S JUST, LIKE--

996
00:35:58,257 --> 00:35:59,758
IT'S TAKING MY BREATH AWAY.

997
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,662
[whispering]

998
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,597
- REMEMBER,
THE MORE STRESSED YOU GET,

999
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:06,898
THE MORE STRESSED
THE BABY GETS.

1000
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,500
SO STAY CALM.
- YEAH, BUT I CAN'T TAKE--

1001
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,037
THIS IS, LIKE, BY FAR,
THE WORST PAIN I'VE FELT.

1002
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:14,506
- NOBODY'S GONNA
LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU.

1003
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:18,310
- SO WE MAY BE GOING
MUCH FASTER--

1004
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,911
YOU HAVE TO--

1005
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,847
- IT'S GONNA PASS.
REMEMBER, THE LAST ONE PASSED.

1006
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:23,482
THIS ONE WILL PASS.

1007
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:24,550
GOOD.
YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

1008
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:29,588
DON'T WORK YOURSELF UP.

1009
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,856
YOU HAVE TO CALM DOWN.

1010
00:36:30,956 --> 00:36:32,258
- I CAN'T BREATHE.
- BREATHE.

1011
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:34,560
- YOU HAVE TO STAY CALM.
JUST BREATHE.

1012
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,862
STAY CALM.

1013
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:38,797
YOU'RE WORKING YOURSELF UP.

1014
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:41,066
CALM. CALM.

1015
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,502
CALM.

1016
00:36:43,602 --> 00:36:46,071
CALM. CALM.

1017
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,642
CALM.

1018
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,278
- OW.

1019
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,280
- CALM.

1020
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,548
- OW.
- CALM.

1021
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:57,849
BREATHE, BABE.

1022
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,951
- OH, MY GOD,
I THINK MY WATER JUST BROKE.

1023
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:05,957
- THIS EPISODE
OF SNOOKI AND JWOWW...

1024
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,759
- CONTINUES NOW.

1025
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,004
- TAKE A BIG BREATH
AND BLOW IT AWAY,

1026
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:21,640
AND TELL YOURSELF,
"I'M DONE WITH ANOTHER ONE."

1027
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,310
ONE MORE CLOSER
TO THE BABY COMING.

1028
00:37:24,376 --> 00:37:26,578
- REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID
BEFORE WE GOT HERE?

1029
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:27,913
IT'S ONLY PAIN.

1030
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:29,481
IT WILL GO AWAY.
I KNOW IT WILL END.

1031
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,482
IT'S JUST PAIN.

1032
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,083
I KNOW IT WILL GO AWAY.

1033
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,852
- YOU'RE DILATING
VERY RAPIDLY.

1034
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,020
- I'M SCARED.

1035
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,522
IT'S JUST THE PEAK
OF THE CONTRACTION

1036
00:37:36,622 --> 00:37:38,590
I CAN'T [bleep] TAKE.

1037
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,393
- MY DAUGHTER'S
COMING IN MINUTES,

1038
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:45,397
AND I AM JUST IN THE WORST PAIN
I'VE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE.

1039
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,098
- YOU'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS.

1040
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,734
- SO, DR. REZAI
COMES IN--

1041
00:37:48,834 --> 00:37:51,202
VERY CALM, COOL, COLLECTED,
LIKE HE'S ALWAYS BEEN.

1042
00:37:51,337 --> 00:37:53,339
- THE BABY'S RIGHT HERE.
I CAN SEE THE BABY'S HEAD.

1043
00:37:53,372 --> 00:37:54,740
- OW!

1044
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,908
AND HER HEAD'S OUT,
BASICALLY.

1045
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,478
LIKE,
SHE'S VISUALLY THERE.

1046
00:37:59,578 --> 00:38:00,779
- IT'LL BE
JUST A FEW MINUTES.

1047
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,481
- THANKS.
- OKAY?

1048
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,982
- HE WALKED IN,
AND HE LOOKS,

1049
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:06,017
AND THEN, HE SAID,
"OKAY, WE'RE DELIVERING NOW.

1050
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,085
I'M SCRUBBING UP."
- YEAH.

1051
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:08,387
- THAT'S HOW IT WENT DOWN.
- YEAH.

1052
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:10,188
HE JUST THOUGHT
HE WAS GONNA CHECK AND BE LIKE,

1053
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:12,023
"ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
20, 30, 40 MINUTES,

1054
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,359
MAYBE A COUPLE HOURS"--

1055
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:16,695
NO, SHE'S GONNA
BE HERE IN A COUPLE PUSHES.

1056
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,900
[Jwoww groaning]

1057
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,908
- YOU KNOW, IT'S--
IT'S BRUTAL TO WATCH,

1058
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:33,144
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

1059
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:35,213
YOU'RE WITNESSING,
OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE,

1060
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:36,582
THE MIRACLE OF BIRTH.

1061
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,183
AND THAT'S TRULY
WHAT IT IS.

1062
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:40,419
YOU KNOW, IT'S--

1063
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,053
IT'S AN AMAZING THING.

1064
00:38:45,891 --> 00:38:47,793
[overlapping voices]

1065
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:50,829
[Jwoww continues groaning]

1066
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,407
EVEN WITH EVERYTHING

1067
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:05,210
THAT I THOUGHT WAS GONNA BE
BLOOD AND GORE, IT WASN'T.

1068
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,613
IT WAS--IT WAS AMAZING,
YOU KNOW?

1069
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:11,550
AND IT WAS THE MOST--
AHEM.

1070
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,420
IT WAS THE MOST POWERFUL THING
I'VE EVER SEEN, YOU KNOW?

1071
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:16,422
- AND PUSH.
THAT'S IT, COME ON.

1072
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:17,823
COME ON, COME ON,
SQUEEZE, SQUEEZE, SQUEEZE.

1073
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:20,191
HARDER, HARDER, HARDER,
HARDER, HARDER, HARDER.

1074
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,094
MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE
MORE, MORE, MORE.

1075
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:25,263
NEED ONE MORE.
COME ON.

1076
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:26,632
AND PUSH.
COME ON.

1077
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:28,299
SQUEEZE THAT BABY OUT.

1078
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:31,870
- [moaning]

1079
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,440
OW!

1080
00:39:34,506 --> 00:39:38,810
[overlapping voices]

1081
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,246
- IT HAPPENED SO FAST.

1082
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:44,816
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, JENNI--SHE
LITERALLY PUSHED THREE TIMES,

1083
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,652
AND ON THAT THIRD PUSH,

1084
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:49,821
YOU KNOW, OUR BABY--
OUR LITTLE GIRL WAS HERE.

1085
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:54,159
AND--
[chokes up]

1086
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:57,829
- MY WHOLE [bleep] PREGNANCY,
FROM BEGINNING TO END,

1087
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:59,831
AND THE HORRIBLE LABOR
THAT I WENT THROUGH,

1088
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:02,033
LITERALLY
WAS JUST A MEMORY

1089
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,969
FROM THE SECOND
I LAID EYES ON MEILANI.

1090
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,304
LIKE, SHE WAS ALL WORTH IT.

1091
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,906
EVERY SINGLE THING--
I WOULD'VE DONE IT

1092
00:40:08,006 --> 00:40:13,244
TEN TIMES MORE AND TEN TIMES
HARDER JUST TO HAVE HER.

1093
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:20,251
- * IF IT'S ALL
I CAN TAKE... *

1094
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,488
- TO FINALLY LAY EYES
ON MY DAUGHTER,

1095
00:40:22,588 --> 00:40:25,857
AND TO FINALLY MEET HER
AND HOLD HER IN THE FLESH--

1096
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,593
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS POSSIBLE

1097
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:31,830
TO LOVE SOMETHING
THAT MUCH IN A--IN A MOMENT.

1098
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:36,602
IT'S--IT'S AN AMAZING THING,
AND SHE'S PERFECT.

1099
00:40:36,702 --> 00:40:39,671
SHE'S--
SHE'S LITERALLY PERFECT.

1100
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:45,711
*

1101
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,482
- NEXT TIME, ON...
- SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW...

1102
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:51,550
- YOU HUNGRY?

1103
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,984
SHE'S LIKE,
"GIVE ME THE BOOB."

1104
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,385
- WELCOME HOME.
WELCOME, MEILANI.

1105
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:56,221
- WELCOME HOME, MEILANI.
- HOT OUT HERE.

1106
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:57,756
WE GOT TO GET HER INSIDE.

1107
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,024
- WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

1108
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,927
both:
WELCOME HOME, MEILANI.

1109
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,529
- BEHAVE.
YOU'RE NOT GETTING DOWN.

1110
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:04,630
PEOPLE ARE JUST LOOKING AT US,

1111
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,898
LIKE, "WHO ARE THOSE WEIRDOES
WITH THE KIDS?"

1112
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:07,933
HE'S CHECKED OUT.
