ACROSS THIS [bleep] ROOM.

337
00:13:00,124 --> 00:13:02,298
- IT'’S COMING OUT, IT'’S CLEAR.
- [laughs]

338
00:13:02,298 --> 00:13:03,921
- DID IT SQUIRT?
WAIT, LET ME SEE!

339
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:05,785
- NO!
- I SHOWED YOU!

340
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:08,615
STOP.
DON'’T SQUIRT ME IN THE EYE.

341
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:13,378
- THANKS FOR THE WONDERFUL DAY.

342
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:14,794
- THANK YOU FOR COMING.

343
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:23,733
WHOA!

344
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:29,878
[baby babbling]
MIGHT POKE SOMEBODY'’S EYE OUT.

345
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:31,155
- MY TURN!

346
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:33,433
- SO I GET HOME,
I'’M EXHAUSTED.

347
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:34,779
IT'’S BEEN A LONG DAY

348
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:37,333
AND I'’M SO EXCITED JUST
TO LAY DOWN AND GO TO SLEEP,

349
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,991
BUT JIONNI GOT LORENZO
THIS TOY HELICOPTER

350
00:13:39,991 --> 00:13:41,510
THAT THEY'’RE BOTH OBSESSED WITH.

351
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:50,174
- CAN I TRY?
I WANNA TRY.

352
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:51,313
- IT'’S JUST A BOY THING.

353
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:52,624
THAT'’S WHY I CAN'’T WAIT
TO HAVE MY GIRL,

354
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,074
BECAUSE THEN WE CAN PLAY
WITH OUR DOLLS.

355
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:56,939
- YEAH, LORENZO!
- WHOA!

356
00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:00,356
- GOOD JOB, LORENZO.
- YOU DID IT.

357
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:04,360
- [cries]

358
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,637
- LORENZO,
YOU CAN'’T THROW THAT.

359
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:09,089
- [cries]

360
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,472
- [laughs]
YOU STOP.

361
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:14,060
- [cries]

362
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,371
- WHAT'’S THE MATTER? YOU DID IT.
- WHAT IS THAT?

363
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:18,029
- TEMPER TANTRUMS
PROBABLY COME FROM ME.

364
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:19,237
- YEP.

365
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:22,240
- WHEN HE WHINES--
- THAT'’S ME.

366
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,140
WHEN HE DOES HIS GOOFY FACES,
THAT'’S ME.

367
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:28,764
- WHEN HE CRIES--

368
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:30,662
- EVERY BABY CRIES.
- WHEN HE DOESN'’T LISTEN.

369
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,250
WHEN HE POOPS UNDER THE TABLE.

370
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,012
- I DON'’T POOP UNDER THE TABLE.

371
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:36,392
SICKO.

372
00:14:36,392 --> 00:14:37,462
LORENZO, YOU BROKE IT.

373
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:38,912
- NO, YOU BROKE IT.

374
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:40,327
- [cries]

375
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:48,301
- HAVE A GOOD DAY.
[kisses]

376
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:49,819
- TAKE CARE OF MY ANGEL BABY.

377
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:51,131
TODAY'’S A TOUGH DAY FOR ME.

378
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:52,995
IT'’S GONNA BE
MY FIRST DAY BACK AT WORK,

379
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,824
LEAVING JENNI, LEAVING MEILANI.

380
00:14:56,378 --> 00:14:58,932
- I'’M EXCITED TO BE AT HOME
ALONE WITH MEILANI TODAY.

381
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:01,314
I MEAN, SHE'’S STILL
JUST A LITTLE MEATBALL.

382
00:15:01,314 --> 00:15:02,729
SHE DOESN'’T REALLY DO MUCH.

383
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:05,214
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE
THIS AND TAKE THIS ON,

384
00:15:05,214 --> 00:15:07,699
'’CAUSE HE DOES WORK FULL-TIME,
AND, YOU KNOW,

385
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,357
I WILL BE IN THIS POSITION
FOR A VERY LONG TIME IN MY LIFE.

386
00:15:10,357 --> 00:15:12,981
GET IN THERE.

387
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:16,536
NOEL.
HEY, DON'’T YOU.

388
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:18,400
GET--
NOEL!

389
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,644
WANT TO SEE THE BABY?
YOU--

390
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:23,232
[dog whining]

391
00:15:23,232 --> 00:15:26,132
[grumbles]

392
00:15:27,616 --> 00:15:30,032
[dog whining]

393
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:32,069
HAVEN'’T EVEN BEEN ABLE
TO GET DRESSED YET.

394
00:15:32,069 --> 00:15:34,761
[dog barking]
HEY!

395
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:35,969
I DON'’T KNOW HOW THE HELL
I'’M GONNA DO THIS,

396
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:36,970
BUT ALL RIGHT.

397
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,009
[dog barking]

398
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:43,287
[buzzing]
[dog whining]

399
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:46,773
YEAH, YOU FEEL THAT?
NO.

400
00:15:46,773 --> 00:15:48,223
IT'’S FOR DIESEL.
WE HAD TO PUT

401
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,363
A STATIC COLLAR ON HIM.

402
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:52,158
GONNA KEEP THIS ON MY WRIST
ALL DAY.

403
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:54,125
HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

404
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,817
[dog barking]
BELLA, I SWEAR TO GOD, BELLA.

405
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:59,234
[dog barking]

406
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:00,925
WHY ISN'’T YOURS WORKING?

407
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:02,996
BELLA'’S BARK COLLAR
IS NOT WORKING RIGHT NOW,

408
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,929
AND SHE'’S SUCH A LITTLE BITCH.
SHE KNOWS IT,

409
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:06,827
AND SHE'’S LIKE
"I'’M JUST GONNA TALK [bleep]."

410
00:16:06,827 --> 00:16:08,139
YOU WOKE THE BABY UP.

411
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,728
[dog barking]

412
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:14,007
THEY NEED TO GO FOR A WALKY.

413
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:17,493
- SO I THINK LAST NIGHT WAS
JENNI'’S FIRST NIGHT ALONE.

414
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:20,531
- REALLY?
- '’CAUSE ROGER HAS WORK.

415
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:22,671
SO SHE, LIKE, DID
THE WHOLE NIGHT SHIFT.

416
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:25,018
- I REMEMBER FOUR OR FIVE DAYS

417
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:26,606
OF GETTING,
LIKE, THREE HOURS OF SLEEP.

418
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:28,159
- MM-HMM.
- WAS THAT RIGHT?

419
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,058
- MM-HMM.

420
00:16:30,058 --> 00:16:33,716
- AND THEN I THINK
WE STARTED THE SHIFT.

421
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:36,271
- IT'’S HARD FOR HER TO DO
A SHIFT IF ROGER'’S WORKING.

422
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:38,342
- WELL, YEAH.
SHE IS THE SHIFT.

423
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:40,723
IT HAPPENS, BUT--
- SHE'’S PROBABLY SO TIRED.

424
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:43,381
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
YOU'’RE A MOM.

425
00:16:43,381 --> 00:16:46,626
[dog barking]
- UGH!

426
00:16:48,386 --> 00:16:51,355
IT DEFINITELY WOULD BE EASIER
IF ROGER WAS THERE TO HELP ME.

427
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:52,701
I'’M EXHAUSTED ALREADY.

428
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:56,774
OOH, FANCY.

429
00:16:56,774 --> 00:16:58,741
[rocker clicking]
OH, MY GOSH.

430
00:16:58,741 --> 00:17:00,950
[rocker stops clicking]
JESUS [bleep].

431
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:04,023
[rocker clicking]
OH, MY GOD.

432
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,507
[rocker clicking]

433
00:17:05,507 --> 00:17:07,026
GOD, YOU'’RE USED TO NOISES.

434
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,995
[rocker clicking]

435
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:14,240
IF YOU DROP MY KID, I WILL KILL
THE OWNER OF FISHER-PRICE.

436
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,317
[phone ringing]

437
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:25,147
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HOW DID YOU SHOWER

438
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:27,046
WHEN LORENZO WAS,
LIKE, TWO WEEKS OLD?

439
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,428
- I DIDN'’T SHOWER.
I SMELLED, I HAD HAIRY ARMPITS,

440
00:17:30,428 --> 00:17:32,120
AND I DIDN'’T EVEN
BRUSH MY TEETH.

441
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,157
[phone ringing]
YOU RANG?

442
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:36,400
- WHAT IF YOU HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM

443
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,677
AND THEY'’RE, LIKE, WIDE AWAKE?

444
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:39,368
- THEN YOU BRING HER
IN THE BATHROOM WITH YOU.

445
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:42,302
- SO LIKE, LORENZO WATCHED YOU
POOP A BUNCH OF TIMES?

446
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:44,442
- YEAH, AND HE STILL COMES
IN THE BATHROOM WITH ME,

447
00:17:44,442 --> 00:17:46,203
AND HE JUST STARES AT ME.
[both laughing]

448
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:47,894
AND HE HANDS ME TOILET PAPER.

449
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:50,172
- YOU'’LL BE HANDING MOMMY
TOILET PAPER ONE DAY.

450
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:51,622
- EW.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

451
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:54,142
I'’M A LITTLE NERVOUS, YOU KNOW,

452
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:56,351
I GUESS NEW MOM JITTERS.

453
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:58,456
- I FEEL LIKE ALL FIRST MOMS
GO THROUGH THIS.

454
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:00,009
- IT'’S LIKE A PARANOID STATE.

455
00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:01,218
- YEAH, IT'’S LIKE,
YOU DON'’T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

456
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:02,564
YOU DON'’T WANT
TO LEAVE THEM FOR A SECOND

457
00:18:02,564 --> 00:18:04,531
EVEN IF YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM

458
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:06,292
BECAUSE YOU'’RE SCARED
THEY'’RE NOT BREATHING.

459
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:10,503
- YEAH, I ALWAYS WAKE UP,
LIKE, FREAKING OUT.

460
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:11,883
- IT'’S NORMAL.

461
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,195
HELLO?
- HI.

462
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:16,025
HOW DID YOU HOLD LORENZO...

463
00:18:16,025 --> 00:18:18,373
- WHOA!
- AND DO STUFF AT THE SAME TIME?

464
00:18:18,373 --> 00:18:19,615
- YOU DON'’T HAVE TO HOLD HER.

465
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:22,480
JUST PUT HER IN THE ROCKER
AND GET YOUR STUFF DONE.

466
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,688
[phone ringing]
- HI AGAIN.

467
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:25,794
- HI AGAIN.
YOU OWN ME.

468
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:27,727
- CAN YOU COME OVER
SO I CAN WALK THE DOGS?

469
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:29,453
- I BELONG TO YOU.

470
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:32,283
HELLO?

471
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:33,353
I QUIT.

472
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:35,493
- CAN YOU COME OVER
SO I CAN PUMP?

473
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:37,875
- ROCKS ARE SO SHARP.

474
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,325
[phone ringing]

475
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,947
- I NEED YOUR HELP AGAIN.
- "OTAY."

476
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:42,362
TOODLES.

477
00:18:42,362 --> 00:18:45,814
[dog barking]
- BELLA! SHUT UP!

478
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:50,301
[phone ringing]

479
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:51,716
- HELLO.
- CAN YOU COME OVER?

480
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,443
- HELLO?
[dog barking]

481
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:57,688
WHOA, DIESEL!
- HEY, I'’M UP HERE.

482
00:18:57,688 --> 00:19:00,622
- UGH, I'’M OUT OF BREATH.
I'’M SO FAT.

483
00:19:00,622 --> 00:19:02,658
HI, BABY.

484
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,764
HOW'’S YOUR VAGINA?
- MM.

485
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:05,765
STILL THERE.

486
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:07,732
HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- TIRED.

487
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:09,631
LORENZO WOKE UP
AT 3:00 THIS MORNING.

488
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:11,736
HE GOES, "I WANT TO GO OUTSIDE."
- DID YOU BRING HIM?

489
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:13,117
- NO.
- [laughs]

490
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:15,050
- SO HE CRIED
UNTIL 7:00 IN THE MORNING.

491
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,811
"OUTSIDE, OUTSIDE."
- [laughs]

492
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:19,503
- BYE.
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME.

493
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:21,470
[phone ringing]

494
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,058
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH MY LIFE?

495
00:19:23,058 --> 00:19:25,025
- CAN YOU COME OVER
SO I CAN COOK?

496
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:26,475
I'’M SURE NICOLE'’S
GETTING ANNOYED

497
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:27,821
WITH ME CONSTANTLY CALLING,

498
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:30,479
BUT SHE MOVED NEXT DOOR TO ME
WHEN I HAD A NEWBORN,

499
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:33,068
SO SHE HAS TO ACCEPT THIS.

500
00:19:33,068 --> 00:19:36,416
- ALL RIGHT, I'’LL BE BACK, KIDS.
DUTY CALLS.

501
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,797
I THINK MY FEET
ARE GETTING FATTER.

502
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:48,704
- WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?
- CHICKEN PARM.

503
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,223
- WHAT TIME
DOES ROGER COME HOME?

504
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:53,640
- 4:00 HE SAID.
- WELL, YOU GOT TWO HOURS.

505
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,540
WANT ME TO SET THE TABLE?
- OH, SURE.

506
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,542
- WHAT IS THIS OCCASION?
JUST--

507
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,821
- DADDY'’S FIRST DAY
BACK TO WORK, MISSING HIS BABY.

508
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:03,961
- ARE YOU GONNA TOUCHY, TOUCHY?

509
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,825
- NO.
- OH.

510
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:07,999
- I'’M NOT GONNA HAVE SEX
WITH ROGER AFTER DINNER TONIGHT.

511
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:10,864
I'’M ONLY TWO WEEKS POST BABY,

512
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:16,180
AND MY STITCHES ARE STILL
DOWN THERE, AND IT'’S VERY RAW.

513
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,423
IT'’S BEEN TEN DAYS.

514
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:19,183
- YOU COULD STILL DO SOMETHING.

515
00:20:19,183 --> 00:20:20,874
- OH, '’CAUSE I DIDN'’T
GIVE BIRTH?

516
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:24,050
HOW ABOUT HIM DO SOMETHING?
I'’M COOKING.

517
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,190
- IF HE [bleep] YOUR NIPPLES,
MILK'’S GONNA COME OUT.

518
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,778
- EW.
THAT'’S EXACTLY WHY

519
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:30,367
WE SHOULD NOT BE DOING
ANY TOUCHY, TOUCHY.

520
00:20:30,367 --> 00:20:33,956
WELL, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT DOING SOMETHING

521
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:35,993
BECAUSE I FEEL TERRIBLE
I MISSED YOUR BRIDAL SHOWER,

522
00:20:35,993 --> 00:20:38,029
SO I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING
WITH YOU.

523
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,445
- LIKE WHAT?
- I DON'’T KNOW,

524
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:41,481
SOMETHING SMALL, INTIMATE,
LIKE A LUNCH.

525
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:44,139
ME AND YOU, MAYBE THE JOEYS.
- YEAH.

526
00:20:44,139 --> 00:20:46,003
- I WANT TO THROW NICOLE
A BRIDAL LUNCHEON

527
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:47,867
THAT'’S REALLY CLOSE TO MY HOUSE

528
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:50,387
BECAUSE I COULDN'’T MAKE
HER BRIDAL SHOWER,

529
00:20:50,387 --> 00:20:53,079
AND I FELT BAD,
AND TO BE HONEST,

530
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,977
I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING NICE FOR HER.

531
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:57,186
- MMM.

532
00:20:57,186 --> 00:20:59,568
GOOD JOB.

533
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:03,779
- WE NEED, LIKE, SOMETHING
FANCY, LIKE TEA AND CRUMPETS.

534
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:06,368
I DON'’T EVEN KNOW
WHAT A CRUMPET IS.

535
00:21:06,368 --> 00:21:08,336
- ISN'’T IT LIKE A CUPCAKE?

536
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:10,579
A FANCY CUPCAKE?

537
00:21:10,579 --> 00:21:12,029
- I WANT TO MAKE IT
A CLASSY AFFAIR

538
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:14,342
BECAUSE NICOLE'’S WEDDING
IS GONNA BE CLASSY.

539
00:21:14,342 --> 00:21:18,311
VERY 1920s GATSBY,
YOU KNOW, PINKY UP.

540
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:23,523
OKAY, I GOT A BED AND BREAKFAST
AND VICTORIAN TEA ROOM.

541
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:26,457
"DRESS LIKE ROYALTY
AND UPPER CLASS."

542
00:21:26,457 --> 00:21:27,493
YOU KNOW WHAT I'’M TALKING ABOUT?
- AND ACTUALLY WEAR

543
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:29,011
VICTORIAN [bleep]?
- YEAH, REMEMBER,

544
00:21:29,011 --> 00:21:31,255
WE DID THAT FOR HALLOWEEN
LAST YEAR?

545
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:33,015
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
- YEAH.

546
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:35,190
- LET'’S GO.
- THEY DO DO ETIQUETTE CLASSES.

547
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,019
- THE JOEYS NEED
ETIQUETTE CLASS.

548
00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:38,366
- YOU DON'’T THINK WE DO?

549
00:21:38,366 --> 00:21:39,574
- YEAH, WE DO.

550
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:42,404
- "HERE ARE A FEW TEA
PARTY ETIQUETTE TIPS.

551
00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:44,648
"AFTER SITTING DOWN,
PUT PURSE ON LAP,

552
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:46,788
OR BEHIND YOU
AGAINST THE BACK OF THE CHAIR."

553
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:48,168
- NO, I JUST PUT IT
ON THE TABLE.

554
00:21:48,168 --> 00:21:50,861
- "UNFOLD NAPKIN AND MAKE SURE
TO PLACE IT ON YOUR LAP."

555
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:53,070
- OH, I KNOW HOW.
- YOU DO?

556
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,658
- I SAW IT ON TITANIC.
- [laughs]

557
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:57,246
- WATCH.

558
00:21:57,246 --> 00:22:00,077
- THREE?

559
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:01,285
- NO ELBOWS ON TABLES.
I KNOW THAT ONE.

560
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:03,805
- "PLEASE EXCUSE YOURSELF
FROM THE TABLE

561
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:05,358
AND GO TO THE LADIES'’ ROOM."

562
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,049
I ACTUALLY DON'’T KNOW
WHO HAS BETTER ETIQUETTE

563
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:09,328
BETWEEN ME AND NICOLE.
I THINK SHE EATS BETTER,

564
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,158
BUT SHE ALSO BURPS, SWEARS,

565
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:13,987
AND ALWAYS SAYS SHE
HAS TO DROP A POOP

566
00:22:13,987 --> 00:22:16,404
IN THE MIDDLE OF HER
CONVERSATIONS AT DINNER,

567
00:22:16,404 --> 00:22:17,681
WHERE I DON'’T DO THAT.

568
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:19,338
- I GOT TO [bleep].
I'’LL BE RIGHT BACK.

569
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,132
- THIS IS WHY WE NEED
PROPER ETIQUETTE.

570
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:22,548
[both laughing]

571
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:24,481
- WE SHOULD GO IN CHARACTERS.

572
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:26,414
LIKE, AS WE'’RE IN COSTUME,
WE HAVE,

573
00:22:26,414 --> 00:22:29,313
LIKE, THE BRITISH ACCENT
AND WE HAVE A WEIRD NAME.

574
00:22:29,313 --> 00:22:31,315
- I WANT TO BE CINDERELLA.

575
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:34,767
- SERIOUSLY?
WHAT ARE YOU, FIVE?

576
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:38,322
I WANT TO BE LATOYA.
- OH.

577
00:22:38,322 --> 00:22:41,221
- NO, WAIT, THAT'’S NOT--
[both laughing]

578
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:42,982
- I'’LL BE ESTHER
IF YOU BE SOMETHING.

579
00:22:42,982 --> 00:22:46,468
- ESTHER, I'’LL BE BERTHA, '’CAUSE
I HAVE TO GIVE BIRTH SOON.

580
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:48,470
- ESTHER AND BERTHA.
- ESTHER AND BERTHA.

581
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,506
- LET ME CALL THE TEA ROOM.

582
00:22:49,506 --> 00:22:51,024
- I DARE YOU TO SWEAR.

583
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:52,888
SAY WE HAVE HORRIBLE
[bleep] MANNERS.

584
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:54,131
- IT HAS TO BE NATURAL.
[phone ringing]

585
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:55,753
- OKAY, YOU SAY THE "F" WORD
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

586
00:22:55,753 --> 00:22:57,341
- I KNOW, BUT DON'’T ASK ME
TO SAY IT,

587
00:22:57,341 --> 00:23:00,655
THEN I GET ALL FREAKED.
- AFTERNOON, 600 MAIN.

588
00:23:00,655 --> 00:23:02,415
- HI, MY NAME IS ESTHER,

589
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:07,834
AND I WAS WONDERING
ABOUT PROPER ETIQUETTE CLASSES

590
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:10,734
AND VISITING YOUR TEA ROOM.

591
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:12,632
- OKAY, AND SORRY.
YOUR NAME IS ESTHER?

592
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:15,083
- YES, MA'’AM.
- SAY IT.

593
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,256
SAY "I'’M [bleep] EXCITED.
THANK YOU."

594
00:23:16,256 --> 00:23:19,674
- DO YOU HAVE A LAST NAME,
ESTHER?

595
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:23,609
- OH.
- "M"--[laughs]

596
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:24,851
- I'’M SORRY, WHAT IS IT?

597
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:28,234
- "M"--
[both laughing]

598
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:31,513
I'’M SORRY, I JUST GOT
REALLY EXCITED.

599
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:34,274
[both laughing]

600
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:37,795
SORRY--
MY GIRLFRIEND--

601
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:40,177
- EXCUSE ME?
- I'’M SORRY, I'’M SORRY.

602
00:23:40,177 --> 00:23:42,593
- M-C-F-A-R-L-E-Y.

603
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:46,148
- M-C-F-A-R-L-E-Y?
[both laughing]

604
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:47,426
- YES.

605
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,221
- [laughing] ESTHER MCFARLEY.
- OKAY.

606
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,983
AND IT'’S FOR ETIQUETTE--
- [laughs]

607
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:54,536
- FOR SOME ETIQUETTE CLASSES

608
00:23:54,536 --> 00:23:59,368
ON MONDAY THE 28TH,

609
00:23:59,368 --> 00:24:02,164
AT 11:00 A.M.
- YEP.

610
00:24:02,164 --> 00:24:04,995
- AND IT'’LL BE THREE WOMEN
AND TWO MEN, OKAY.

611
00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:06,652
- TWO WOMEN.
- YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

612
00:24:06,652 --> 00:24:08,274
- THAT'’S FINE.
- WE'’RE ALL WOMEN.

613
00:24:08,274 --> 00:24:10,138
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

614
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:11,277
- THANK YOU FOR CALLING.

615
00:24:11,277 --> 00:24:12,761
- OKAY, BYE NOW.

616
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:14,314
- THAT WAS GOOD.

617
00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:16,524
I ALMOST PEED IN MY PANTS.

618
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:18,180
- OKAY, BYE.

619
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,459

620
00:24:23,634 --> 00:24:25,912
OW.
SQUIRREL?

621
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:27,742
[screams]
JIONNI!

00:24:27,742 --> 00:24:31,780
EW!

623
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,851
[shudders]

624
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:36,820
WALKING INTO THE KITCHEN,
I SEE THIS HUGE SPIDER.

625
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,511
JIONNI ALREADY KNOWS
I HATE SPIDERS.

626
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:39,823
I WANT NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM,

627
00:24:39,823 --> 00:24:42,377
AND I DON'’T KNOW WHY
YOU SAVED THIS CREATURE.

628
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:44,448
JUST KILL IT AND GET IT
OUT OF MY KITCHEN.

629
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:47,796
EW! EW!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

630
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:50,661
IT'’S GONNA CRAWL IN YOUR HAIR.
UGH.

631
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:51,766
I'’M ITCHY NOW.

632
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:53,077

633
00:24:53,077 --> 00:24:55,494
- I'’M GONNA LET IT GO.
- OH, BABY, STOP.

634
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,599
STOP, DON'’T DO IT.
STOP.

635
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:58,807
GET IT AWAY.
I'’M NOT KIDDING.

636
00:24:58,807 --> 00:25:01,154
JIONNI!
JIONNI, PLEASE!

637
00:25:01,154 --> 00:25:02,224

638
00:25:02,224 --> 00:25:03,985

639
00:25:03,985 --> 00:25:05,193
- I'’M GONNA LET IT GO.

640
00:25:05,193 --> 00:25:07,091
- NO, KILL IT.
SQUISH IT.

641
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,437
JIONNI, IT'’S JUST GONNA
COME BACK IN.

642
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:09,508
IT'’S GONNA BRING
ALL OF HIS FRIENDS.

643
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,681
- YOU'’RE VERY--IT'’S NOT--

644
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:12,062
THAT'’S NOT HUMANE.
- JIONNI, PLEASE.

645
00:25:12,062 --> 00:25:14,305
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE'’S MOTHER THERESA.

646
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,100
I'’D RATHER JIONNI
JUST KILL THE SPIDER

647
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,861
SO I NEVER HAVE TO
SEE IT AGAIN.

648
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:21,002
I CAN'’T BELIEVE
A SPIDER THAT BIG EXISTS.

649
00:25:26,663 --> 00:25:29,010
- HELLO, PUPPY DOGS.

650
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,114
BABE?

651
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:31,530
- HI, BABE.
I'’M IN THE DINING ROOM.

652
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,809
- AH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHERE'’S MY LITTLE ANGEL?

653
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:36,189
OH, WHAT'’D YOU DO,
MAKE DINNER?

654
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:38,329
- YEAH.
- NO WAY.

655
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,504
MY FAVORITE.
- YEP.

656
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:42,644
- AWESOME.
HOW'’S MY ANGEL BABY?

657
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:43,783
- SHE'’S SLEEPING.
- SLEEPING.

658
00:25:43,783 --> 00:25:45,578
WHAT'’D YOU DO THAT FOR?
THAT'’S AWESOME.

659
00:25:45,578 --> 00:25:47,649
- IT'’S YOUR FIRST DAY
BACK TO WORK.

660
00:25:47,649 --> 00:25:49,409
- THANK YOU,
AND YOU CAN HAVE WINE NOW?

661
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:50,756
- YEAH.
- AWESOME.

662
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:52,689
I MIGHT ACTUALLY
GET SOME TONIGHT.

663
00:25:52,689 --> 00:25:55,346
- YOU CAN'’T HAVE ANYTHING,
BESIDES WINE.

664
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:56,831
THAT'’S AS MUCH AS YOU GET.

665
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:58,729
ROGER IS SUPER SURPRISED
BY DINNER,

666
00:25:58,729 --> 00:26:00,524
AND THAT MAKES ME HAPPY,

667
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:02,837
'’CAUSE HE'’S SO HAPPY
THAT I DID THIS FOR HIM.

668
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:04,563
- THIS IS AWESOME.

669
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,772
WE'’RE, LIKE, DOMESTICATED NOW
OR SOMETHING.

670
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,086
- OH, MY GOD.

671
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:13,399
- NO, THAT WENT RIGHT
PERFECTLY BETWEEN YOUR BOOBS.

672
00:26:13,399 --> 00:26:15,677
- OH, MY GOD.
- YOU WEAR MORE OF YOUR FOOD

673
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:17,679
THAN YOU EVER EAT
EVERY TIME WE GO TO DINNER.

674
00:26:19,474 --> 00:26:20,993
- I ALWAYS DROP FOOD
IN MY CLEAVAGE.

675
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:23,167
THIS IS WHY I HAVE TO GO
TO A PROPER ETIQUETTE CLASS.

676
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:27,447
I DON'’T EVEN KNOW
HOW THAT HAPPENED.

677
00:26:28,794 --> 00:26:31,762
IT FELL OFF MY FORK.

678
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:34,316
- MAYBE IF I GET HUNGRY LATER,
I'’LL MAKE LOVE TO YOU.

679
00:26:34,316 --> 00:26:36,318
YOU HAVE A BIG CHUNK
UP ON THE TOPSIDE TOO.

680
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:37,941
- [laughs]
- HOW DO YOU DO THAT

681
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:39,667
EVERY TIME, HONESTLY?
- [laughs]

682
00:26:39,667 --> 00:26:42,601
- HONESTLY.
MM-HMM.

683
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:45,258
- HELLO.

684
00:26:45,258 --> 00:26:46,605
- I'’D BE AFRAID
IF I UNDRESSED YOU,

685
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,916
I'’D FIND HALF A CHICKEN PARM
DOWN YOUR SHIRT.

686
00:26:47,916 --> 00:26:48,814
- [laughs]

687
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:59,997
both: ONE, TWO, THREE, WHEE!

688
00:26:59,997 --> 00:27:03,863
- WE SCREAM, YOU SCREAM,
WE ALL SCREAM FOR ICE CREAM.

689
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,214
- TONIGHT WE'’RE GONNA BRING
LORENZO TO GET SOME ICE CREAM.

690
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:11,699
HE LOVES ICE CREAM,
AND IT'’S GONNA BE

691
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:13,632
A LITTLE FAMILY NIGHT OUT.

692
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,668
- WE'’RE HERE.

693
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,568
YAY, ICE CREAM.

694
00:27:19,568 --> 00:27:22,226
- HERE YOU GO.
- OH, MY GOSH.

695
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:24,850
- I'’M GONNA PIG OUT.
I'’VE DECIDED.

696
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,817
THIS IS PRETTY BIG
FOR A SMALL.

697
00:27:26,817 --> 00:27:29,268
- GOOD JOB, LORENZO.

698
00:27:29,268 --> 00:27:30,476
- YUMMY.

699
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:33,065
- THANKS, DADA.

700
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,549
TONIGHT'’S JUST AWESOME.
IT'’S, LIKE, LITERALLY

701
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:37,897
YOUR TYPICAL
DOWN THE SHORE FAMILY NIGHT.

702
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:47,148
WHOA.
- WHAT?

703
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:48,218
- LOOK AT THAT GUY.

704
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,945
- HO!
- HOLY--

705
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:52,601
- JIONNI, WHAT--
IS THAT A BEETLE?

706
00:27:52,601 --> 00:27:54,465
- YEAH.

707
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,053
- IT'’S FRICKING GROSS.

708
00:27:56,053 --> 00:27:57,883
- ROGER MUST BE
FEEDING IT STEROIDS.

709
00:27:57,883 --> 00:27:59,263
- [laughs]

710
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:04,683
WE GET HOME, AND THERE IS
A HUMAN/COCKROACH INSECT

711
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,477
ON OUR FRONT PORCH.
- DINOSAUR.

712
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,721
EW, EW, THERE'’S SPIDERS--
[gasps]

713
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:11,586
DID YOU JUST SQUISH IT?

714
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:14,071
JIONNI, NOW YOU HAVE TO KILL IT.
IT'’S SUFFERING.

715
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:17,005
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT,
BUT YOU WOULDN'’T KILL A SPIDER?

716
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:19,939
[crunching]
both: OH!

717
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,425
- GO.
- DO YOU FEEL GUILTY?

718
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:25,876
YOU SHOULD, '’CAUSE
YOU JUST KILLED A HUMAN BEING.

719
00:28:25,876 --> 00:28:27,360
- THIS HOUSE GIVES ME
THE CREEPS.

720
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,845
- THIS IS DISGUSTING.
- WHOA!

721
00:28:28,845 --> 00:28:30,950
- EW.
- YO, I'’M KIND OF NERVOUS

722
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,848
TO SLEEP NOW.

723
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:36,335
OH, MY GOD.

724
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:37,716
- WHAT?

725
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,303
- THERE'’S ANTS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

726
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:41,271
UGH!

727
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:42,928
- EW, LOOK AT THEM ALL.

728
00:28:42,928 --> 00:28:45,171
- THERE'’S AN ANT FARM
LIVING IN OUR KITCHEN.

729
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:47,104
IT'’S JUST--
- THERE HAS TO BE, LIKE, 50 ANTS

730
00:28:47,104 --> 00:28:48,174
ON THE FLOOR IN THE KITCHEN.

731
00:28:48,174 --> 00:28:51,902
STOP, STOP!
I HATE THIS HOUSE.

732
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:53,559
STOP.

733
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:55,561
THIS HOUSE IS NOT LIVABLE.

734
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:58,150
WHY DON'’T YOU STAY IN HERE
AWAY FROM THE BUGS?

735
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,361
ME AND DADDY ARE GONNA
CLEAN THEM, ALL RIGHT?

736
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:05,467
OH, I'’M SO ITCHY.
I HATE THIS PLACE.

737
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:07,228
YOU'’RE MISSING THEM.

738
00:29:07,228 --> 00:29:09,989
YOU'’RE JUST PARANOID.
THERE'’S NOTHING ON YOU.

739
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:11,059
- THERE WAS SOMETHING
ON MY BACK.

740
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:13,096
- IT'’S PROBABLY A FLY.

741
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:14,614
- DADDY!

742
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:16,444
- OKAY.

743
00:29:16,444 --> 00:29:17,756
- YOU'’RE MAKING ME ITCH.

744
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,171
- SORRY.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

745
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:21,000
NOT ITCH MY ITCHINESS?

746
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:23,209
- [screams]

747
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:24,590
I'’M SHOWERING
BEFORE I GO TO BED,

748
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,833
BECAUSE IF WE DON'’T,
I FEEL LIKE

749
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,869
WE'’RE GONNA BRING THE ANTS
INTO OUR BED.

750
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:31,459
CRACK KILLS!
[laughs]

751
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:33,530
OOH!
[blubbering]

752
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,049
- WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF YOU WOKE UP WITH A COCKROACH

753
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:36,326
LITERALLY NEXT TO YOUR HEAD?

754
00:29:36,326 --> 00:29:38,742
- I'’D LEAVE.
I WOULDN'’T COME BACK HERE.

755
00:29:38,742 --> 00:29:41,434
SEE?
WE'’RE JUMPY.

756
00:29:41,434 --> 00:29:43,712
- WELL, YOUR CRACK'’S
OUT ALL THE TIME.

757
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:46,163
- MY CRACK'’S NEVER OUT.
YOU GOT A NICE CRACK.

758
00:29:46,163 --> 00:29:48,890
- YOU HAVE A HAIRY CRACK.
- YOU HAVE A HAIRY CRACK!

759
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,065
- YOUR MOM'’S GOT A HAIRY CRACK.
- JIONNI!

760
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:02,386
[doorbell ringing]

761
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:04,423
- JANICE AND JOE
ARE COMING DOWN FOR THE WEEKEND,

762
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:06,252
AND I'’M REALLY EXCITED
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

763
00:30:06,252 --> 00:30:08,496
I'’M USED TO SEEING JANICE
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

764
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:10,084
I HAVEN'’T SEEN HER.

765
00:30:10,084 --> 00:30:11,188
both: HELLO!

766
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:12,189
- [whispering]
LORENZO'’S SLEEPING.

767
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:13,881
- OH.
- OH!

768
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,020
HI.
- THIS IS NICE.

769
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,435
- HELLO.
- TOLD YOU.

770
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:18,092
- THIS IS NICE HERE.

771
00:30:18,092 --> 00:30:19,679
- JANIS AND JOE GET HERE,

772
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,096
AND OF COURSE THEY HAVE
TONS OF FOOD TO MAKE.

773
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,201
WHAT'’S THIS?

774
00:30:24,201 --> 00:30:25,306
WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT?
STOP.

775
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:26,721
- THIS IS WHAT YOU'’RE
GONNA MAKE.

776
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:27,998
- STOP, NO, I'’M NOT MA--I'’M NOT.
- COME HERE. COME HERE.

777
00:30:27,998 --> 00:30:30,483
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO,
IT'’S JIONNI'’S FAVORITE.

778
00:30:30,483 --> 00:30:31,657
- OH, NO.
- COME ON.

779
00:30:31,657 --> 00:30:33,141
- I DON'’T DO THAT.
- WHY?

780
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:35,385
- I'’M NOT COOKING THAT,
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

781
00:30:35,385 --> 00:30:37,456
- [chewing]
- FIRST OF ALL, THEY'’RE ALIVE

782
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:39,734
WHEN YOU'’RE BOILING THEM,
WHICH IS SO INHUMANE,

783
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:40,942
AND THEY LOOK LIKE SPIDERS.

784
00:30:40,942 --> 00:30:42,461
- THEY'’RE NOT SPIDERS.

785
00:30:42,461 --> 00:30:44,152
- NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
- [humming]

786
00:30:44,152 --> 00:30:45,740
YOU'’LL BE ALL RIGHT.
- YOU'’RE A MURDERER.

787
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,086
- JIONNI, LOOK WHAT I GOT YOU,
HONEY.

788
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:49,986
both: LOBSTERS.
- OOH.

789
00:30:49,986 --> 00:30:51,539
- I--SHE WON'’T MAKE THEM.
- [laughs]

790
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:52,954
- OH, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

791
00:30:52,954 --> 00:30:54,128
I WOULD NEVER KILL A LOBSTER.

792
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:55,923
THAT'’S LIKE KILLING A CAT
OR A DOG.

793
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:56,924
NOT DOING THAT.

794
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:59,098
COME ON, PUP.
OUTSIDE?

795
00:30:59,098 --> 00:31:00,962
COME ON.

796
00:31:00,962 --> 00:31:03,240
SHOW ME YOUR JUMPY JUMP.
COME ON.

797
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:06,416
THERE IT IS.
LET'’S SEE.

798
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:10,765
- OKAY, HEY, WELL
HOW ABOUT HELPING ME

799
00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:11,973
WITH THE FAMILY RECIPE?

800
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:15,080
- WHAT IS THAT?
- SAUSAGE.

801
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,288
- [chuckles]
- DON'’T START FREAKING OUT

802
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:18,290
ON THINGS, COME ON.
- [laughs]

803
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,913
I WOULD LOVE TO LEARN
HOW TO COOK LIKE JANIS,

804
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:23,467
JUST SO, YOU KNOW,
I COULD DO THAT FOR JIONNI,

805
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,918
BUT ALSO IT'’S A NICE, YOU
KNOW, BONDING EXPERIENCE

806
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:27,230
FOR ME AND JANIS.

807
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:31,061
- OKAY, CHOP MEAT.
VEAL, PORK, BEEF,

808
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:32,821
THREE DIFFERENT KINDS.
- OH, WOW.

809
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:34,685
I WANT TO COOK THINGS
THAT JIONNI LOVES

810
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,309
SO I KNOW THAT HE'’LL EAT IT
AND HE WON'’T THROW UP.

811
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:39,104
NOT THE STEMS, RIGHT?

812
00:31:39,104 --> 00:31:40,968
- NO STEMS.
HERE, CHOP, CHOP.

813
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:42,797
- THIS BIG GUY?
- YES.

814
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:44,730
- WHAT IS THIS AGAIN?
- PARSLEY.

815
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,594
- CAN YOU JUST GET IT
ALREADY MADE?

816
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:49,804
- KEEP CHOPPING.

817
00:31:49,804 --> 00:31:51,357
- IS THAT GOOD?
- THAT'’S PRETTY GOOD.

818
00:31:51,357 --> 00:31:52,980
PUT YOUR HANDS IN IT.

819
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,878
- EW!

820
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:57,398
THIS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT
RECIPE THAN MY GRANDMA'’S.

821
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:00,090
- HOW DOES YOUR GRANDMA MAKE IT?

822
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:03,024
- SHE LIKES A LITTLE BREAD CRUMB
TO MAKE IT DRY.

823
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:04,750
- NO.

824
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,097
- I GUESS EVERYBODY MAKES
THEIR [bleep] DIFFERENT.

825
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:10,894
I FEEL LIKE ALL ITALIANS
MAKE MEATBALLS A DIFFERENT WAY.

826
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:13,655
- GOOD.
DOING GOOD.

827
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:15,554
- SO WHEN DID YOU START COOKING?

828
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:17,694
- OH, GOSH.
I COOKED EARLY.

829
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:20,352
MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO COME OVER
ALL THE TIME

830
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:21,940
AND COOK WITH MY MOM.

831
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,253
THEY USED TO, LIKE, MAKE
HOMEMADE MACARONIS AND STUFF.

832
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:26,254
- HOME--LIKE,
MAKE THE DOUGH?

833
00:32:26,254 --> 00:32:28,084
- YEAH.
- WOW.

834
00:32:28,084 --> 00:32:30,845
NOW THAT I'’M PRACTICING
AND I'’M LEARNING HOW TO COOK,

835
00:32:30,845 --> 00:32:33,710
IT'’S ACTUALLY FUN, BECAUSE
I KNOW THAT I CAN PROVIDE

836
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,678
AN EDIBLE MEAL
FOR MY MAN AND MY SON.

837
00:32:36,678 --> 00:32:38,197
IS THAT IT?

838
00:32:38,197 --> 00:32:40,061
THAT WAS EASY.

839
00:32:40,061 --> 00:32:41,545
- OKAY, LET'’S HEAR YOU
REPEAT IT.

840
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:45,170
- OH.
[laughs]

841
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:49,105
SO JANIS IS TESTING ME
ON WHAT WE PUT IN THE SAUCE,

842
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:50,830
BUT I MEAN, YOU CAN'’T ASK ME
WHEN I'’M PREGNANT,

843
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,212
'’CAUSE I HAVE PREGNANCY BRAIN.

844
00:32:53,212 --> 00:32:55,904
- YOU STARTED OUT WITH?

845
00:32:57,665 --> 00:32:58,631
- OIL.

846
00:33:00,702 --> 00:33:02,808
UM, COW MEAT?

847
00:33:02,808 --> 00:33:04,913
EVEN IF I WASN'’T PREGNANT,
I PROBABLY WOULD'’VE FORGOT.

848
00:33:04,913 --> 00:33:08,158
I THINK I CAN HANDLE IT.
- MM-HMM.

849
00:33:08,158 --> 00:33:09,332
THEN MAYBE WE'’LL MAKE
LASAGNA TOO?

850
00:33:09,332 --> 00:33:10,609
- YES!

851
00:33:10,609 --> 00:33:13,060
I DON'’T KNOW HOW TO MAKE
LASAGNA, SO--

852
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,440
IS LASAGNA FATTENING?

853
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,546
- NO, NOT AT ALL.
- ARE YOU SURE?

854
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:18,720
EVERY TIME I EAT IT,
I FEEL LIKE A WHALE.

855
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,998
- OF COURSE IT IS.

856
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,896
- OH.
YOU GOT POT CHEESE?

857
00:33:21,896 --> 00:33:23,932
- MM-HMM,
SEE, YOU KNOW.

858
00:33:23,932 --> 00:33:26,073
- POT CHEESE IS RICOTTA.

859
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:28,903
I CALL IT "RICOTTA,"
BUT FOR SOME REASON,

860
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:31,009
PEOPLE IN JERSEY
CALL IT "POT CHEESE."

861
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:34,598
HOW MUCH?

862
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,325
- OH, THAT'’S GOOD.

863
00:33:37,325 --> 00:33:38,671
- WAS THAT TOO MUCH?
- NO, THAT WAS OKAY.

864
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:40,363
THAT WAS OKAY.
- I COULD SCOOP IT OUT.

865
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:44,401
- NO, IT'’S ALL RIGHT.
- IT COMES OUT QUICK.

866
00:33:44,401 --> 00:33:45,816
- KEEP GOING.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

867
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,059
- WELL, '’CAUSE THE SALT'’S
NOT EVEN COMING OUT.

868
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,441
- IT IS.

869
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:50,925
- KEEP GOING.
- OH, MY GOD.

870
00:33:50,925 --> 00:33:53,065
- [laughs]
I'’M TELLING YOU, KEEP GOING.

871
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:55,378
OKAY, GOOD.
YOU'’RE GOOD.

872
00:33:55,378 --> 00:33:57,863
- IF I DID THAT MYSELF,
I WOULDN'’T KNOW HOW MUCH.

873
00:33:57,863 --> 00:34:00,383
- OH, YOU WANT AN EXACT NUMBER?
- YEAH.

874
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:02,937
- YOU'’RE NOT GONNA GET THAT
FROM ME.

875
00:34:02,937 --> 00:34:05,871
- CAN WE TELL JIONNI I MADE IT
AND YOU JUST TOLD ME WHAT TO DO?

876
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:08,184
- UH-HUH, THE WHOLE THING.

877
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:10,289
- HE'’LL BE SO PROUD.
- MM-HMM.

878
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:12,602
OKAY, YOU CAN PUT
A LAYER OF GRAVY DOWN.

879
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:16,157
OVERLAP THEM A LITTLE BIT.

880
00:34:16,157 --> 00:34:19,505
- CHEESE.
- CHEESE, YUMMY, YUMMY.

881
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:23,440
- IT'’S HEAVY.

882
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,959
THIS IS SO EASY.

883
00:34:24,959 --> 00:34:26,616
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE
SO MUCH HARDER,

884
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:29,239
BUT DUDE, MAKING LASAGNA
IS A PIECE OF CAKE.

885
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,034
- THAT'’S PICTURE PERFECT.

886
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:32,070
- MORE!
- WHAT?

887
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,933
- LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.
- MORE? OKAY.

888
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:35,935
- MY FIRST LASAGNA.

889
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:37,489
I PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE?

890
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:40,008
WE MIGHT NOT HAVE ROOM.
- WE DON'’T HAVE ANY ROOM.

891
00:34:40,008 --> 00:34:42,425
- WELL, I MEAN,
WE CAN USE JENNI'’S FRIDGE.

892
00:34:42,425 --> 00:34:45,704
- ARE THEY UP?
- SHE IS MY NEIGHBOR.

893
00:34:45,704 --> 00:34:47,706
SHE'’S PROBABLY SLEEPING.
WE COULD JUST SNEAK IN THERE

894
00:34:47,706 --> 00:34:49,294
REAL QUICK.

895
00:34:49,294 --> 00:34:51,503
JUST HAVE TO BE QUIET
'’CAUSE WE CAN'’T WAKE THE BABY.

896
00:34:51,503 --> 00:34:52,711
- OH.

897
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:54,333
CAREFUL, DON'’T FALL.
- I WON'’T FALL.

898
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,818
- YOU GOT LASAGNA, DON'’T FALL.
- OOH, IT'’S DARK OUT.

899
00:34:56,818 --> 00:34:58,544
OH, A LIGHTNING BUG.

900
00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:00,615
WE'’RE BREAKING AND ENTERING.

901
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,928
[laughs]

902
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:08,106
[whispering]
ALL RIGHT, JUST OPEN IT.

903
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,592
OH YEAH,
HOW DO--ALL HER LIGHTS TURN OFF?

904
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:13,421
MINE ARE ON ALL NIGHT.
[dog barking]

905
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:14,974
LET'’S PUT IT [bleep]
AND GET THE [bleep] OUT.

906
00:35:14,974 --> 00:35:17,253
HURRY, HURRY.
OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD.

907
00:35:17,253 --> 00:35:18,737
- YOU DIDN'’T TELL ME
SHE HAD A DOG.

908
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:20,911
- SHE HAS THREE DOGS.
- THREE DOGS.

909
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,085
[dog barking loudly]

910
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:25,364
ARE YOU KIDDING?
[both laughing]

911
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:28,195
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
[both laughing]

912
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:30,645
- OH, I FORGOT ABOUT THE DOGS.
- GET THE DOOR, OH, MY GOD.

913
00:35:30,645 --> 00:35:32,164
OH, MY--
THAT DIDN'’T WAKE '’EM UP.

914
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:33,096
[baby crying]

915
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,308
- THIS EPISODE
OF SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW...

916
00:35:38,308 --> 00:35:41,208
- CONTINUES NOW.

917
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:50,907
- SO I GOT UP EARLY THIS MORNING
TO MAKE BREAKFAST FOR JENNI,

918
00:35:50,907 --> 00:35:52,840
WHO'’S STILL IN BED,
AND, YOU KNOW,

919
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,255
IT'’S JUST I WANT
TO MAKE TODAY SPECIAL.

920
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:55,981
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY.

921
00:35:55,981 --> 00:35:58,017
- YOU TOO.

922
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:00,744
- HOW'’S MY ANGEL BABY?
- YOU SMELL GOOD, LIKE FOOD.

923
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:02,401
- I'’M MAKING BREAKFAST FOR YOU.

924
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:04,127
GIRLS HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT
ANNIVERSARIES.

925
00:36:04,127 --> 00:36:05,232
IT'’S OUR...
- THIS IS OUR FIRST DATE

926
00:36:05,232 --> 00:36:06,371
FULL YEAR.
- FOUR YEAR ANNIVERSARY

927
00:36:06,371 --> 00:36:07,751
OF OUR FIRST DATE.
- YES, IT'’S THAT--

928
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,408
- NOT THE DATE
WE GOT ENGAGED, NOT--

929
00:36:09,408 --> 00:36:13,205
- NO, THAT WILL BE
TWO YEARS...

930
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:14,724
both: IN SEPTEMBER.

931
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:16,657
- I WAS ACTUALLY JUST GONNA
FIX MY FACE.

932
00:36:16,657 --> 00:36:18,831
I'’LL FIX IT IN THERE
AND I'’LL MEET YOU DOWNSTAIRS?

933
00:36:18,831 --> 00:36:20,350
- WE'’VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR FOUR YEARS, BABE.

934
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,283
I KNOW WHAT YOUR FACE LOOKS
LIKE WHEN MAKEUP'’S NOT ON IT.

935
00:36:22,283 --> 00:36:23,802
OH, SHE JUST SPIT UP.

936
00:36:23,802 --> 00:36:25,493
SHE'’S SPITTING UP A LOT.
- THERE YOU GO.

937
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:27,771
- SHE'’S SPITTING UP A LOT.
- IT'’S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

938
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,842
[baby vomiting]
- OH, MY GOD, BABE.

939
00:36:29,842 --> 00:36:31,741
- JUST KEEP HER--
[baby coughs]

940
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:34,744
- BABE, SHE IS--
- ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN.

941
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:36,539
ROGER'’S FREAKING OUT
A LITTLE BIT

942
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:37,816
BECAUSE MEILANI'’S SPITTING UP,

943
00:36:37,816 --> 00:36:39,438
BUT I'’M TRYING TO TELL HIM,
JUST CALM DOWN,

944
00:36:39,438 --> 00:36:42,061
YOU DON'’T WANT TO MAKE HER UPSET
BY YOU BEING UPSET.

945
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:43,580
- YOU DIDN'’T BURP HER.
- SHE CAN STILL BREATHE.

946
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,548
SHE CAN STILL BREATHE.
- AM I FREAKING OUT?

947
00:36:45,548 --> 00:36:47,757
I REALIZE THAT SHE CAN BREATHE.
I GET IT,

948
00:36:47,757 --> 00:36:49,241
BUT SHE'’S SPITTING UP A LOT.

949
00:36:49,241 --> 00:36:50,967
- SHE JUST DRANK THIS.

950
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:53,141
- THAT WAS, LIKE, THE ENTIRE
BOTTLE SHE JUST SPIT UP.

951
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:55,627
THE CALMEST ONE WHEN THIS
HAPPENS IS ACTUALLY MEILANI.

952
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:57,456
IT DOESN'’T SEEM
TO AFFECT HER OR BOTHER HER,

953
00:36:57,456 --> 00:36:59,803
BUT AS A PARENT,
TO WATCH IT, IT'’S SCARY.

954
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:02,737
THAT WAS SO MUCH SPIT UP, GIRL.

955
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:05,706
- WELL, SHE'’LL DEFINITELY WANT
HER "BABA" IN A MINUTE, THEN.

956
00:37:05,706 --> 00:37:07,225
- YEAH, MOMMY ALWAYS WANTS
ANOTHER DRINK

957
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,985
WHEN SHE THROWS UP EVERYWHERE...
- SURE DO.

958
00:37:08,985 --> 00:37:11,194
- SHE'’S READY TO GO.

959
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:13,507
SO WHILE JENNI WAS
IN THE BATHROOM DOING HER MAKEUP

960
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:15,819
OR WHATEVER IT IS
SHE DOES IN THERE,

961
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:17,683
YOU KNOW, I'’M GONNA BRING
MEILANI DOWNSTAIRS

962
00:37:17,683 --> 00:37:19,858
AND GIVE HER ANOTHER BOTTLE.

963
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:21,584
SCARED YOUR DADDY.

964
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:23,206
PROBABLY READY
FOR ANOTHER BOTTLE IN A MINUTE.

965
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:25,104
YOU THINK MOMMY AND DADDY
COULD EAT REAL QUICK?

966
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:31,456
[singing] HI, BABY.
HI, BABY.

967
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:36,875
OH, I NEVER KNOW WHAT TAKES
YOUR MOTHER SO LONG TO DO STUFF.

968
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,359
SHE'’S GOT TO DO HER MAKEUP
BEFORE SHE CAN COME

969
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:42,639
HAVE BREAKFAST WITH YOUR DADDY,
SO BREAKFAST IS GETTING COLD.

970
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,538
TRY TO BE ROMANTIC.

971
00:37:44,538 --> 00:37:46,678
IT LOOKS LIKE WE'’RE EATING
A COLD BREAKFAST.

972
00:37:47,955 --> 00:37:50,164
DADDY LOVES YOU.

973
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:53,271
SO AT THIS POINT, HONESTLY,
I'’M JUST OVER BREAKFAST.

974
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:57,999
[sighs]

975
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,691
I'’M TOO ANNOYED.
I DON'’T EVEN WANT TO EAT,

976
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:03,971
AND, YOU KNOW, FEELING
DISRESPECTED BY MY FIANCEE.

977
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:07,077
- OH, YOU MADE A NEW ONE?
- MM-HMM.

978
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:09,735
- I HAVE THIS ONE TOO.

979
00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:13,601
[laughs]

980
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:18,261
WHAT?

981
00:38:18,261 --> 00:38:20,677
- I THOUGHT WE COULD HAVE
BREAKFAST FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY

982
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:24,094
AND IT'’S ALWAYS SOMETHING.
[dog barking]

983
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:27,201
- ALL RIGHT.
I'’M HERE.

984
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:29,479
WE HAVE TO STILL FINISH
FEEDING HER.

985
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:31,447
- I'’M ANNOYED THAT
IT TAKES YOU A HALF AN HOUR

986
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:33,449
TO DO YOUR MAKEUP
JUST TO COME AND HAVE BREAKFAST.

987
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:36,210
- WELL, IT SMELLS GOOD.
- WELL, GO EAT.

988
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:39,178
- NO, I'’M GONNA WAIT FOR YOU.

989
00:38:39,178 --> 00:38:43,113
I DON'’T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'’RE UPSET.

990
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:45,737
I THOUGHT I ONLY TOOK, LIKE,
SIX OR SEVEN MINUTES UP THERE.

991
00:38:45,737 --> 00:38:48,498
[dog barking]
NOEL, STOP!

992
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:49,741
- IF YOU DON'’T GET IT...
- HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA TAKE...

993
00:38:49,741 --> 00:38:52,122
- YOU'’RE NOT GONNA GET IT.
- TO GET OVER IT?

994
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:54,539
- I'’M OVER IT,
BUT WHAT I'’M SAYING IS,

995
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:56,817
I TRY TO DO SOMETHING
YOU SAY I NEVER DO.

996
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:57,818
I'’M NEVER ROMANTIC
AND I NEVER DO THIS.

997
00:38:57,818 --> 00:38:58,819
- WAS IT ACTUALLY YOUR IDEA,
THOUGH?

998
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:00,096
- IT ABSOLUTELY WAS MY IDEA.

999
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,615
- I'’M JUST ASKING.
- ALL RIGHT.

1000
00:39:01,615 --> 00:39:04,756
I'’M NOT THAT KNIGHT
IN SHINING ARMOR, UNFORTUNATELY.

1001
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:06,551
I THINK I'’M A GOOD MAN,
BUT THE ONE THING I'’M NOT,

1002
00:39:06,551 --> 00:39:08,794
AND JENNI IS RIGHT,
IS I'’M NOT MR. ROMANCE,

1003
00:39:08,794 --> 00:39:11,279
AND I NEED TO WORK ON THAT,
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW,

1004
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:13,972
TODAY I MADE AN EFFORT
AT DOING THAT AND IT KIND OF--

1005
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:15,353
THE DOOR GOT SLAMMED IN MY FACE.

1006
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,355
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU'’RE GONNA TELL SOMEBODY

1007
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:19,633
THAT THEY NEVER DO THOSE THINGS
FOR YOU EVER,

1008
00:39:19,633 --> 00:39:21,704
AND THEN YOU SEE SOMEONE
MAKING AN HONEST EFFORT

1009
00:39:21,704 --> 00:39:23,947
AND YOU COULD CARE LESS,

1010
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,777
YOU KNOW, WOULDN'’T YOU
TAKE THAT PERSONALLY?

1011
00:39:25,777 --> 00:39:27,192
I DO.

1012
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:28,504
I'’VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU, JENNI.

1013
00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:29,815
- NO, I'’M JUST MAKING SURE.

1014
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:31,230
- WELL, IT WAS.
SO NOW YOU KNOW, OKAY?

1015
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,300
- OKAY.

1016
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,199
- I'’M NOT ARGUING
IN FRONT OF HER.

1017
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,752
- NO, DON'’T.

1018
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:37,340
- THAT'’S WHAT YOU WANTED.
- NO, NO.

1019
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,100
- YOU WANTED TO SAY
THAT IT WASN'’T MY IDEA.

1020
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,481
- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
- NO, YEAH,

1021
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:41,482
WELL, NOW YOU KNOW.
- NO.

1022
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:43,864
- NOW YOU KNOW.

1023
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:46,004
- OH, GOOD LORD.

1024
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:49,041
NOT ARGUING.

1025
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,974
- YOU JUST DID, ACTUALLY.
THAT WAS ALL YOU.

1026
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:53,563
- WELL, I'’M SORRY.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW

1027
00:39:53,563 --> 00:39:55,323
CERTAIN THINGS.
OH.

1028
00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:57,705
I DON'’T LIKE HOW ROGER WENT UP
THE STAIRS AND SLAMMED THE DOOR

1029
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:00,812
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I MADE
A SMARTASS COMMENT AND QUESTION,

1030
00:40:00,812 --> 00:40:02,676
HE SHOULDN'’T HANDLE THINGS
LIKE THIS.

1031
00:40:02,676 --> 00:40:05,506
I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT COMMENT.
- I JUST--I NEED TEN MINUTES.

1032
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:07,577
- I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT COMMENT.
- NOT IN FRONT OF HER.

1033
00:40:07,577 --> 00:40:08,716
I NEED TEN MINUTES.
- THAT'’S FINE.

1034
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:09,821
- OKAY, YOU STAY WITH HER, THEN.

1035
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:12,099
- BUT I APOLOGIZE
FOR THAT COMMENT.

1036
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:13,514
UGH.
- UGH.

1037
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:16,206
YOUR DADDY IS ACTUALLY CRAZY.

1038
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:19,865
I DON'’T EVEN UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE HELL

1039
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:20,935
HE'’S SO UPSET ABOUT.

1040
00:40:24,974 --> 00:40:27,459
[engine starting]

1041
00:40:35,674 --> 00:40:37,952
HE PROBABLY TOOK OFF TO MEXICO.

1042
00:40:41,749 --> 00:40:44,649
JUST ME AND YOU, NOW.

1043
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,447
- NEXT TIME ON
SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW...

1044
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,207
- MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE
ON THIS PLANET,

1045
00:40:51,207 --> 00:40:52,760
JENNI KNOWS HOW
TO PUSH MY BUTTONS.

1046
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,073
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- HE LEFT '’CAUSE HE WAS UPSET.

1047
00:40:55,073 --> 00:40:57,109
I THINK HE'’S JUST
LOST HIS DAMN MIND.

1048
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:59,733
TEA ROOM, DARLING.
- [burps]

1049
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:02,632
- THAT'’S PROBABLY
NOT GONNA SWING HERE.

1050
00:41:02,632 --> 00:41:04,462
- TELL THE WHOLE TABLE
WHAT IT SMELLS LIKE.

1051
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,360
- [bleep].
[laughter]
