00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:47,666
AND YOU COULD HAVE HELPED CLEAN,

141

OR YOU COULD HAVE HELPED
DO SOMETHING.

AND TAKEN HER FROM ME.

00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:54,017
NOBODY SAID YOU HAD TO CLEAN.

JIONNI WAS HANDLING IT ALL.

- JENNI, I THREW THE PARTY.
I WAS CLEANING.

147
00:04:57,642 --> 00:04:59,091
- YOU TOOK THAT UPON YOU...
- NO, IT'’S FINE.

148
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,128

TO GET AGGRAVATED AT ME.

00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:03,510

THIS AGAIN?

I HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

157
00:05:15,418 --> 00:05:19,215
I HAD TO LEAVE.
I JUST FELT UNCOMFORTABLE.

158
00:05:19,215 --> 00:05:22,149
- DO ME A FAVOR AND SPEAK ON IT
RATHER THAN GET ANNOYED,

159
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:24,703
'’CAUSE I WOULD MUCH RATHER
YOU SIT WITH HER AND HOLD HER

160

BUT YOU DON'’T SAY ANYTHING.
- RIGHT.

162
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,399
- YOU JUST TAKE THE INITIATIVE,
YOU GO DO IT,

163
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,263
AND THEN--AND THEN YOU ACT
ALL P.O.'’D AT ME,

SHORT-TEMPERED WITH ROGER

166
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:38,441
ONLY BECAUSE I'’M TIRED.

167

00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:49,743
AND, LIKE,
IVORIES AND CHAMPAGNES.

335
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:51,883
- OKAY. THE CENTERPIECES,
WHAT DO YOU THINK--

336
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,367
- HUGE.
- HUGE.

337
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:56,439
- HUGE CHANDELIERS, FEATHERS,

338
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:58,441
AND THEN REALLY,
REALLY GORGEOUS FLOWERS.

339
00:11:58,441 --> 00:12:00,478
- LIKE THE GATSBY.
- AND THEN I ACTUALLY BOUGHT

340
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:03,170
PEARLS THAT I WANT
TO DRAPE ON THE CHANDELIERS.

341
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,309
- YOU CAN DO THAT--
- I WANT IT ALL HIGH.

342
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,552
- YOU WANT IT ALL HIGH.

343
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:07,209
SO YOU WANT ALL HIGH, ALL BIG,
ALL OUT THERE.

344
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,625
- YEAH, SO WHEN PEOPLE WALK IN,
THEY'’RE LIKE, "WOW."

345
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:11,213
- OKAY.
SO I'’LL PUT SOME FLOWERS

346
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:13,733
AND SOME VASES OUT,
AND THEN YOU CAN GO BACK THERE,

347
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,286
AND YOU CAN SHOW ME
WHAT YOU'’RE THINKING.

348
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:16,943
- I DON'’T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT FLOWERS, BUT--

349
00:12:16,943 --> 00:12:18,220
- NEITHER DO I, SO IT'’S OKAY.

350
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,600
[laughter]

351
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,121
- LET'’S START THIS [bleep].

352
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:24,364
- COME ON, MAN,
YOU GOTTA STEP IT UP, MAN.

353
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:25,779
SHE'’S BEATING YOU HERE.
COME ON.

354
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,367
- IT'’S ALL ABOUT
HOW IT LOOKS AT THE END.

355
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:29,334
- THAT'’S RIGHT.
HE'’S GOT EXPERIENCE HERE.

356
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:31,923
I CAN TELL.
- IT'’S THE COMPETITION.

357
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:34,201
WE'’RE NOT FRIENDS.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

358
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,375
GET OUTTA HERE.
- YOU TOOK ALL OF '’EM.

359
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,894
OH.

360
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:38,999
I REALLY DON'’T CARE WHAT
JIONNI'’S DOING WITH HIS FLOWERS,

361
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:42,313
BECAUSE I HAVE AN ORIGINAL,
REALLY, REALLY GOOD IDEA,

362
00:12:42,313 --> 00:12:44,936
AND JUST PEEKING OVER
AND LOOKING AT HIS FLOWERS,

363
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:46,213
NONE OF THEM MATCH,

364
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:48,560
AND HE'’S JUST PICKING
RANDOM FLOWERS. SO...

365
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,941
- YOURS IS UGLY.
I ALREADY WON,

366
00:12:49,941 --> 00:12:53,220
JUST LOOKING AT
WHAT YOU'’VE BEEN PICKING OUT.

367
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,497
- DONE.

368
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:55,705
- COOL.

369
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:58,329
- SO WHICH ONE
LOOKS MORE GATSBY?

370
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,641
MY BOUQUET IS THE MORE GATSBY
THAN JIONNI'’S.

371
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:01,919
- I WASN'’T TRYING
TO MAKE IT LIKE THE WEDDING--

372
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,785
- WHITE FLOWERS.
- OBVIOUSLY.

373
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,235
- NOW YOU'’RE JUST SAYING THAT
'’CAUSE YOU LOST AND I WON.

374
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:09,789
- [scoffs]

375
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,273
- MINE ARE MORE GATSBY.

376
00:13:11,273 --> 00:13:12,964
- I WASN'’T TRYING
TO MAKE THEM GATSBY.

377
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,000
- YOU'’RE A SORE LOSER.
IT'’S OKAY.

378
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,484
- SHUT UP.

379
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,768
- JIONNI, LET'’S NOT SLEEP.
COME ON.

380
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:26,564
LET'’S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

381
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:28,324
- SURE YOU STILL WANT TO DO IT?
- UH-HUH.

382
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:31,120
WE SHOULD'’VE JUST ELOPED.
SO MUCH EASIER.

383
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,535
- I WAS ASKING YOU THAT
FOR TWO YEARS NOW.

384
00:13:32,535 --> 00:13:34,054
- YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR TUXES.

385
00:13:34,054 --> 00:13:36,160
- WHAT ELSE?
THE BAND.

386
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,540
- WE HAVE TO CALL OUR BAND.

387
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,579
I HAVE TO DO MY MAKEUP
AND HAIR TRIALS WITH MY GIRLS.

388
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,995
I'’M GOING THROUGH
MY WEDDING BINDER.

389
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:47,585
YOU KNOW, THERE'’S A LOT
OF [bleep] TO DO.

390
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:51,520
JIONNI!

391
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,419
- OOH, IT'’S AN ANGEL BABY.

392
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:56,836
YOU ARE A LITTLE EATING MACHINE,
GIRL.

393
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,045
HOW MANY OUNCES IS THIS? 2?
- YEAH.

394
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:00,736
SHE'’S UP TO, LIKE, 3.

395
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:03,221
CAN'’T BELIEVE
THAT WAS A WEEK AGO.

396
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:06,259
MY VAGINA STILL
SAYS IT WAS YESTERDAY.

397
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:07,674
HOW DO YOU WANT
TO DRESS HER TODAY?

398
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:08,986
- CUTE.

399
00:14:08,986 --> 00:14:11,126
SHE'’S GONNA BE AN ANGEL BABY.
- ANGEL BABY?

400
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,231
HE JUST LIKES TO SAY "ANGEL
BABY" A THOUSAND TIMES A DAY.

401
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:15,682
I'’VE NEVER HEARD SOMETHING SO,
LIKE--IT'’S LIKE A BROKEN RECORD.

402
00:14:15,682 --> 00:14:17,822
"ANGEL BABY, ANGEL BAB--
MY ANGEL BABY."

403
00:14:17,822 --> 00:14:19,341
- WHAT ARE WE DOING, ANGEL BABY?

404
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,756
HI, ANGEL BABY.

405
00:14:20,756 --> 00:14:22,413
DADDY'’S ANGEL BABY RIGHT THERE.

406
00:14:22,413 --> 00:14:23,897
HI, ANGEL BABY.

407
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,830
DADDY'’S LITTLE ANGEL BABY.

408
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,866
ANGEL BABY.

409
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,488
HI, ANGEL BABY.

410
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:29,730
MY BABY'’S AN ANGEL BABY.

411
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,387
HI, ANGEL BABY.

412
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:33,044
- DADDY'’S GONNA
CHANGE YOUR NAME.

413
00:14:33,044 --> 00:14:34,874
WE SHOULD'’VE JUST
NAMED HER ANGEL.

414
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:35,875
HE'’S SO NUTS.

415
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,222
UGH.

416
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:40,465
SORRY, MY BOOBS HURT.
[laughs]

417
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:42,088
- WE COULD PUT A BURLAP BAG
ON YOU,

418
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:43,227
AND YOU'’D STILL BE
A LITTLE ANGEL BABY.

419
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:44,331
- [chuckles]

420
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,787
- I WANT TO GO SEE JENNI.
- CHECK IN ON THEM?

421
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:52,995
- ACTUALLY, I DON'’T EVEN
WANT TO GO SEE JENNI.

422
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,755
I WANT TO SEE MEILANI.

423
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,382
[scoffs]

424
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:01,417
JESUS.

425
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:03,972
HELLO.
- HELLO.

426
00:15:03,972 --> 00:15:05,421
LOOK AT YOU.

427
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,458
- IT'’S FROM JANIS.
- OH, MY GOD, I LOVE HER.

428
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:09,287
- YEAH.

429
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:10,633
WHY ARE YOU SKINNY AGAIN?

430
00:15:10,633 --> 00:15:11,669
YOU'’RE SUCH A WHORE.

431
00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:12,704
I HATE YOU.

432
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,534
- [laughs]
- HI, BABY.

433
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:15,707
- YOU'’RE GONNA BE
THE SAME EXACT WAY.

434
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,743
- I BETTER.

435
00:15:16,743 --> 00:15:17,882
I HAVE A WEDDING DRESS
TO FIT IN.

436
00:15:17,882 --> 00:15:19,573
- I KNOW.

437
00:15:19,573 --> 00:15:21,506
- OH, DO YOU WANT TO GO
GET YOUR NAILS DONE?

438
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:22,852
- I NEED TO.

439
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:23,957
- I NEED TO GET A PEDICURE.

440
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,717
- MY BRIDAL SHOWER IS TOMORROW.

441
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,547
- I DON'’T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

442
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:28,962
I'’M REALLY BUMMED THAT I CAN'’T

443
00:15:28,962 --> 00:15:31,482
MAKE IT TO NICOLE'’S BRIDAL
SHOWER, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

444
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:32,655
I JUST HAD A BABY.

445
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:34,657
BUT EVEN THOUGH NICOLE
IS VERY UNDERSTANDING,

446
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:37,867
I STILL FEEL
A LITTLE DEBBIE DOWNER-ISH.

447
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:39,317
- IT'’S LIFE.

448
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:40,870
- WILL YOU GET HER DRESSED
WHILE I GET DRESSED?

449
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,596
- OH, YEAH.

450
00:15:42,596 --> 00:15:44,219
EVEN IF SHE'’S SLEEPING?

451
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:45,599
- IT'’S EASIER.
- OKAY.

452
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,153
- AND IF SHE FUSSES,
JUST USE THIS.

453
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:49,017
THAT'’S WHAT ROGER SAYS.
- OH, I FORGOT HOW TO DO THIS,

454
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:52,710
BUT SHE'’S IN GOOD HANDS.

455
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,884
YOU'’VE GOT BIG NIP-NIPS.

456
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:56,507
SO HOW IS IT? TOUGH?

457
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:57,853
NO SLEEP?

458
00:15:57,853 --> 00:15:59,510
- YEAH, IT'’S NOT EASY.
I'’M NOT GONNA LIE.

459
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,513
WE DON'’T GET MUCH SLEEP, BUT I
WOULDN'’T TRADE IT FOR THE WORLD.

460
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:03,755
YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE THESE DOWNSTAIRS?

461
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:04,791
- OH, YEAH.
- THANK YOU.

462
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,895
- JANIS MADE THEM FOR YOU GUYS.

463
00:16:05,895 --> 00:16:06,896
- OH, DID SHE REALLY?
- YEAH.

464
00:16:06,896 --> 00:16:08,277
- NO WAY.
- IS THIS ALL RIGHT?

465
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:10,383
'’CAUSE I DON'’T HAVE
NON-MATERNAL CLOTHES HERE.

466
00:16:10,383 --> 00:16:11,591
- YOU LOOK AMAZING.

467
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:12,833
YOU DON'’T EVEN LOOK
LIKE YOU HAD A BABY.

468
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:15,595
- SERIOUSLY, SHE'’S NOT FAT.
WHO DOES THAT?

469
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:16,906
- IT'’S A WEEK.
IT'’S BEEN A WEEK.

470
00:16:16,906 --> 00:16:18,184
READY TO GO.
I'’LL JUST GET THE BOTTLES.

471
00:16:18,184 --> 00:16:19,909
- WILL YOU WATCH HER WHILE ME
AND NICOLE GO GET NAILS?

472
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:21,773
- MM-HMM.
SURE.

473
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,683
- I'’M GONNA PISS MY PANTS.

474
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:36,133
WHITE?
- WHITE. OKAY.

475
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:37,927
- IT'’S REALLY NICE TO GET
MY NAILS DONE WITH JENNI TODAY,

476
00:16:37,927 --> 00:16:39,999
JUST BECAUSE I REALLY,
REALLY NEED IT.

477
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,793
I WANT TO LOOK PRETTY
FOR MY BRIDAL SHOWER,

478
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,831
AND PLUS I WANT
TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH BOO.

479
00:16:44,831 --> 00:16:46,143
- I'’M PROBABLY GONNA CRY
TOMORROW.

480
00:16:46,143 --> 00:16:47,627
- SERIOUSLY?

481
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:49,146
- I'’M SERIOUS.

482
00:16:49,146 --> 00:16:51,044
- IT'’S NOT LIKE YOU'’RE MISSING
THE BACHELORETTE PARTY.

483
00:16:51,044 --> 00:16:52,494
I GOT A LOT OF [bleep] GOING ON.

484
00:16:52,494 --> 00:16:55,704
- I CAN'’T IMAGINE.

485
00:16:55,704 --> 00:16:57,844
- WHEN IT'’S ALL OVER,
I'’M GONNA BE SO RELIEVED.

486
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:59,052
- RIGHT.

487
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:00,019
- WHEN WE'’RE DONE
I CAN JUST LIVE MY LIFE.

488
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,675
THEN WE CAN PLAN OUR VEGAS TRIP.

489
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:02,987
- SERIOUSLY.

490
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:05,541
- I REALLY HOPE WE'’RE
THOSE MOMS THAT, LIKE,

491
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:09,476
WHEN OUR GIRLS ARE 18 OR, LIKE,
21, THEY GO TO VEGAS TOGETHER

492
00:17:09,476 --> 00:17:10,926
AND THEY WANT US TO COME.

493
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:13,998
- I AM SO EXCITED FOR OUR
DAUGHTERS TO BE BEST FRIENDS.

494
00:17:13,998 --> 00:17:15,827
- MM-HMM. THEY'’RE GONNA
BE INSANE TOGETHER.

495
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:17,174
- YEAH.
- THEY'’RE GONNA BE LIKE US.

496
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:18,313
- MM-HMM.
- THAT'’S SCARY.

497
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,073
- THAT I'’M NOT LOOKING
FORWARD TO.

498
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,662
- COCKTAILS, PLEASE.

499
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:25,734
- I AM NOT CHASING MY DAUGHTER
DOWN IN KARMA.

00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:13,590
YOU HOLD HER.
YOU'’LL CONTROL THE SITUATION.

670
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,213
I'’M LETTING YOU DO IT ALL. COOL?
- YUP.

671
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,663
THE DOGS DON'’T BEHAVE
FOR ANYBODY,

672
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:19,285
SO I'’M EXTREMELY NERVOUS

673
00:24:19,285 --> 00:24:21,529
BECAUSE DIESEL LIKES TO JUMP.
HE'’S GOT SHARP NAILS.

674
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:23,047
I JUST DON'’T WANT
TO SEE ANYTHING BAD HAPPEN.

675
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:25,533
SO I'’M GONNA DO IT, YOU KNOW,
KIND OF LEISURELY.

676
00:24:25,533 --> 00:24:28,156
[chittering]

677
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:30,330
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT GOING DOWNSTAIRS

678
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,263
AND MEETING THE DOGGIES?

679
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,542
IF THEY BOTHER YOU AT ALL,

680
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,958
DADDY WILL PEN THEM UP
IMMEDIATELY.

681
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,994
- THE ONLY THING
I'’M WORRIED ABOUT WITH MY DOGS

682
00:24:38,994 --> 00:24:40,686
IS ROGER.

683
00:24:40,686 --> 00:24:42,584
I'’M NOT CONCERNED WITH THEM.

684
00:24:42,584 --> 00:24:44,103
IT'’S ROGER THAT'’S CONCERNED

685
00:24:44,103 --> 00:24:45,898
WITH HOW THEY'’RE GONNA REACT
AROUND MEILANI,

686
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:47,624
SO WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

687
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:49,833
- OH, YOU SMELL THE BABY?

688
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,938
[dog sneezes]
OH.

689
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:54,147
NO SNEEZING ON THE BABY.

690
00:24:54,147 --> 00:24:55,459
NO, YOU CAN S--
YOU CAN SMELL,

691
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:58,704
BUT YOU CAN'’T JUMP UP HERE.

692
00:24:58,704 --> 00:24:59,670
IT'’S A BABY.

693
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,396
LOOK AT BELLA.
YOU CAN SMELL.

694
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:03,122
- WAS SHE GIVING HER KISSES?
- YEAH.

695
00:25:03,122 --> 00:25:05,434
- OH, SHE GAVE HER KISSES.
- YOU CAN SMELL.

696
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:06,988
- AW.
- IT'’S A BABY.

697
00:25:06,988 --> 00:25:08,403
IT'’S A BABY, BELLA.

698
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:09,749
THE DOGS ACTUALLY DID
EXCEPTIONALLY WELL

699
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:10,923
WHEN THEY MET MEILANI.

700
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:12,303
YOU KNOW, NONE OF THEM
JUMPED ON HER,

701
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,202
NONE OF THEM WERE BARKING,
NONE OF THEM WERE BEING,

702
00:25:14,202 --> 00:25:15,686
YOU KNOW, TOO CRAZY.

703
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:17,067
THEY WERE ALL REALLY GOOD.

704
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:18,965
- AW, THEY'’RE BEING GOOD,
THOUGH.

705
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:19,966
- MM-HMM.
- THEY ARE BEING GOOD.

706
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:23,107
I'’M IMPRESSED.

707
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:24,764
- HOW'’S YOUR COFFEE, BABE?
GOOD?

708
00:25:24,764 --> 00:25:25,903
- IT'’S GOOD.
WHY, WHAT'’D YOU DO TO IT?

709
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:28,768
- NOTHING.
I'’M JUST SAYING.

710
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:30,287
OH, SHE JUST LAUGHED.

711
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:31,702
SHE JUST LAUGHED.

712
00:25:31,702 --> 00:25:33,532
- YEAH, '’CAUSE SHE KNOWS
DADDY'’S A PRANKSTER.

713
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,913
- [laughs]
- DAD--DADDY MADE IT WITH LOVE.

714
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:37,156
MOMMY SAW DADDY MAKE IT.

715
00:25:37,156 --> 00:25:40,262
- MAKE ME ANOTHER ONE.

716
00:25:40,262 --> 00:25:42,575
- OPEN THAT DOOR.

717
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:44,370
NO, DON'’T JUMP.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'’S GO.

718
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,199
- LET'’S GO, ANGEL BABY.
- COME ON, GUYS.

719
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:50,687
- LINDSAY'’S GOTTA
GO AND LIVE HER LIFE.

720
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:51,688
OH, YEAH, GOT YOUR CHECK.

721
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:53,897
DON'’T MIND.
- [laughs]

722
00:25:53,897 --> 00:25:55,001
- THAT WOULD HAVE
REALLY SUCKED

723
00:25:55,001 --> 00:25:57,970
IF I WOULD'’VE GOT BREAST MILK
ON THAT.

724
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:01,767
I WOULD--
I FORGOT IT WAS IN THERE.

725
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,492
- I LOVE MEETING THE BABY.

726
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:05,633
- YEAH.

727
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,186
- SEE YOU GUYS.
- BYE.

728
00:26:07,186 --> 00:26:09,188
- BYE.
- SEE YOU TOMORROW, LINDS.

729
00:26:09,188 --> 00:26:10,327
- WHAT?

730
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:15,297
YOU DID PUNK ME,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

731
00:26:15,297 --> 00:26:18,059
- I PULLED THAT OFF FLAWLESSLY.

732
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:19,336
- YOU'’RE RUDE.

733
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:21,407
YOU MADE ME DRINK
MY OWN COLOSTRUM.

734
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:24,272
- BEST CREAMER YOU EVER HAD.
- YOU'’RE AN ASS.

735
00:26:30,865 --> 00:26:33,177
- WHY'’S THERE SO MANY CARS?

736
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:36,318
WHO THE [bleep] IS HERE?

737
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:38,597
HELLO.
- HI.

738
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,322
- THE BRIDE'’S HERE.

739
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:41,841
- YAY.

740
00:26:41,841 --> 00:26:44,810
- RIGHT WHEN I GET TO MY MOM'’S,
I SEE ALL MY GIRLS,

741
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,466
AND I'’M JUST SO HAPPY
TO SEE THEM,

742
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:48,365
AND I FEEL LIKE
THEY'’RE VERY, VERY EXCITED

743
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:49,711
FOR THIS BRIDAL SHOWER.

744
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:52,369
SO WE'’RE GONNA GET [bleep] DONE
TONIGHT.

745
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:54,095
LET'’S GET GOING, BITCHES.

746
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:55,821
- TIME TO WORK.
- YEAH, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

747
00:26:55,821 --> 00:26:57,236
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

748
00:26:57,236 --> 00:26:58,789
- DO THE GOODY BAGS FIRST,
'’CAUSE THAT'’S GONNA

749
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:01,585
TAKE THE LONGEST.
GOODY BAGS.

750
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:03,932
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, NIC?
LIKE, ONE THING IN EACH BAGGIE?

751
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:08,074
- ONE OF EACH
AND THEN CONCEALER,

752
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:10,698
LIP BALM, AND THAT'’S IT.
- AND THE FANS.

753
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:12,458
- OH, THE FANS WE'’RE GONNA PUT
ON THE TABLE, WE DECIDED.

754
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:15,495
I HAVE TO MAKE THE FAVOR BAGS
FOR ALL OF THE GUESTS,

755
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:18,395
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO,
LIKE, 200 BAGS.

756
00:27:18,395 --> 00:27:20,017
I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE
ALL MY FRIENDS'’ HELP.

757
00:27:20,017 --> 00:27:22,261
I LOVE MY FRIENDS TO DEATH.
I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR THEM.

758
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:24,643
SO, YOU KNOW,
THEY DO THE SAME FOR ME.

759
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,748
MOM, CAN YOU FEED ME?

760
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:28,301
- I CAN FEED YOU.

761
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:29,820
- TAKE THE CONCEALER--

762
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,995
- ARE THEY
THE LITTLE BLACK PACKAGES?

763
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:33,065
- YEAH, ONE.
ONE LIP GLOSS.

764
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,307
- ONE OF EACH
OR JUST ONE LIP GLOSS?

765
00:27:34,307 --> 00:27:36,413
- I'’M JUST GONNA BRING
THIS WHOLE BOX IN HERE.

766
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:37,759
- AIM, YOU'’RE DOING LOTION?

767
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,071
OR YOU'’RE DOING LOTION?
- I DON'’T KNOW.

768
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:40,451
WE DIDN'’T DISCUSS ANYTHING.

769
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:44,352
- YEAH, WE'’LL JUST, LIKE,
ROTATE THE TABLE.

770
00:27:44,352 --> 00:27:47,010
- THIS IS BODY POLISH,
AND THAT'’S BODY WASH.

771
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,701
- WELL, DO WE WANT
TO DO THE TISSUE PAPER FIRST?

772
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,220
- THIS THING TOO?
- ONE OF EACH.

773
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,808
- OKAY.
- DO WE HAVE ENOUGH?

774
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:52,981
- OH, MY GOD.

775
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:54,431
- DO WE HAVE THESE LITTLE ONES
OVER THERE?

776
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:56,088
IS ANYBODY DOING THOSE?
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

777
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:57,330
- TURMOIL.

778
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,435
- ARE THESE GOOD?

779
00:27:58,435 --> 00:27:59,470
- THESE FEEL A LITTLE LIGHT.

780
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,508
- WE FORGOT ABOUT THOSE.

781
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:04,199
- YOU KNOW,
I'’M A VERY NICE PERSON,

782
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,270
BUT I FEEL LIKE
THIS IS THE ONLY TIME

783
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,894
WHERE I CAN BE A BITCH
AND BOSS PEOPLE AROUND.

784
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:10,861
- THESE ARE DONE.
- LIKE A BUNCH OF MONKEYS.

785
00:28:10,861 --> 00:28:14,693
IT'’S MY DAY,
AND WHATEVER I SAY GOES.

786
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,177
ARE YOU COUNTING?
- I WASN'’T, NO.

787
00:28:16,177 --> 00:28:17,972
- WAS ANYONE COUNTING?
all: NO.

788
00:28:17,972 --> 00:28:19,870
- YOU GUYS SUCK.

789
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,596
ANIMALS.
[laughs]

790
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,362
- WANNA EAT?
- DO YOU WANT SUSHI?

791
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:32,331
- OOH!

792
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:33,642
GOOD CALL.

793
00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:35,196
- GET OUTTA THERE.
- WHAT?

794
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:36,473
I ALWAYS LIKE
TO SQUEEZE YOUR HEINIE.

795
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:39,269
THEN I FORGET
THERE'’S A DIAPER ON THERE.

796
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:40,580
- DADDY'’S MEAN.

797
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:43,549
I'’M SO EXCITED
TO HAVE OUR FIRST FAMILY DINNER

798
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:45,551
AND THE SIX OF US.

799
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:48,727
NOT THE THREE OF US,
THE SIX OF US.

800
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,144
- THREE PEOPLE, THREE DOGS,
JUST SO WE'’RE CLEAR.

801
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:54,594
SHE SPIT UP ALL OVER HERSELF AND
THE PILLOW THAT WAS DOWN THERE.

802
00:28:54,594 --> 00:28:56,493
- AW.
- I'’M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT.

803
00:28:56,493 --> 00:28:59,013
- I GOT THIS CUTE OUTFIT
FOR HER.

804
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:02,119
ACTUALLY, FOR THE FUR BABIES
TOO.

805
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,018
- OH, YEAH?

806
00:29:04,018 --> 00:29:06,710
CAN WE CHANGE THAT TO
"I AM YOUR OWNER"?

807
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,954
- STOP.

808
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:10,749
- THAT'’S WHAT SHE IS.

809
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,303
THEY'’RE DOGGIES.
YOU'’RE HUMAN.

810
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:14,856
- HELLO.

811
00:29:14,856 --> 00:29:16,444
- I ALMOST CAN'’T BELIEVE
WHAT I SEE.

812
00:29:16,444 --> 00:29:19,136
JENNI, I FEEL, IS
BEING A LITTLE RIDICULOUS.

813
00:29:19,136 --> 00:29:20,724
DADDY DRESSED THE BABY.

814
00:29:20,724 --> 00:29:22,174
GUESS WHAT MOMMY GETS TO DRESS.

815
00:29:22,174 --> 00:29:23,969
SHE GETS TO DRESS THE IDIOTS.

816
00:29:23,969 --> 00:29:25,591
SHE DOES TREAT HER DOGS--

817
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:28,318
OUR DOGS--LIKE HUMANS,

818
00:29:28,318 --> 00:29:30,354
EVEN THOUGH IT DRIVES ME
A LITTLE NUTS.

819
00:29:30,354 --> 00:29:31,597
- COME ON, GUYS.

820
00:29:31,597 --> 00:29:33,875
PUT THESE ON.
UH-OH.

821
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,221
- THAT'’S TIGHT ON THAT BIG BOY.

822
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:36,498
- I DON'’T KNOW
IF IT'’S GONNA FIT YOU, BUBBY.

823
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:39,536
COME HERE, BUBBY.

824
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:40,986
AH, THERE WE GO.

825
00:29:40,986 --> 00:29:43,920
I THINK MAMA GOT THE WRONG SIZE.

826
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,543
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU BELONG
IN THE '’80s.

827
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:49,684
- DO YOU FEEL STUPID, DIESEL?

828
00:29:49,684 --> 00:29:51,444
AND DON'’T YOU LOOK FOOLISH.

829
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:55,000
- MOMMY'’S SORRY.

830
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,449
[laughs]

831
00:29:56,449 --> 00:29:58,831
MOMMY'’S SORRY.

832
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:00,212
SO THE ONESIES

833
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:02,697
KIND OF, YEAH, THEY DON'’T WORK
FOR THE DOGS THAT MUCH.

834
00:30:02,697 --> 00:30:05,734
DIESEL'’S AND BELLA'’S IS
A LITTLE SNUG, BUT WE'’RE GONNA

835
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:08,082
MAKE THE BEST EFFORT,
SO WE CAN HAVE A FAMILY DINNER

836
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:11,188
TOGETHER AND EVERYONE
WEAR THEIR CUTE OUTFITS.

837
00:30:11,188 --> 00:30:14,329
FIRST FAMILY MEAL.

838
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:17,850
TO OUR FAMILY.
- TO OUR VERY UNRESTED YET...

839
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,991
- PERFECT.
- PERFECT FAMILY.

840
00:30:20,991 --> 00:30:23,545
DIESEL, YOU STINK, MAN.

841
00:30:23,545 --> 00:30:24,961
- OH.

842
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:27,342
ONE BIG, HAPPY FAMILY?

843
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:31,346
[dog barks]
BE ANGELS!

844
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:32,382
- WHAT IS THIS?

845
00:30:32,382 --> 00:30:34,108
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT?

846
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:36,144
- THIS ONE DOESN'’T
HAVE CONDITIONER.

847
00:30:36,144 --> 00:30:37,870
- WHAT?
- DID YOU GUYS [bleep] UP?

848
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,665
MOM, THEY'’RE CHAOTIC.

849
00:30:39,665 --> 00:30:41,943
WHAT DID YOU FORGET TO DO?
- NOTHING.

850
00:30:41,943 --> 00:30:43,393
- WHAT'’D YOU FORGET
TO PUT IN THE BAGS?

851
00:30:43,393 --> 00:30:44,877
- SHE DOESN'’T WANT TO BE BLAMED.
- NOTHING!

852
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,430
SOME ARE SHAMPOO,
AND SOME ARE CONDITIONER.

853
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,604
- NO, EVERY BAG HAS--

854
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:49,399
- SOME GOT SHAMPOO.
SOME GOT CONDITIONER.

855
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,642
- SUPPOSED TO DO BOTH.
- WHOOPSIE.

856
00:30:51,642 --> 00:30:53,541
- WE'’LL GO BACK IN
AND PUT ONE IN EACH.

857
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:55,819
BUT THEN THEY MIGHT GET TWO
CONDITIONERS AND ONE SHAMPOO.

858
00:30:55,819 --> 00:30:58,028
THIS IS LIKE--
- YOU GUYS ARE MORONS.

859
00:30:58,028 --> 00:30:59,858
- STUFFING BAGS WITH [bleep]--

860
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,238
- MY FRIENDS ARE ASS[bleep],

861
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:03,689
SO I'’M NOT SURPRISED
THAT MY FRIENDS,

862
00:31:03,689 --> 00:31:06,795
YOU KNOW, MESSED UP MY BAGS
FOR ALL OF MY GUESTS.

863
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:08,867
BUT I MEAN,
AS LONG AS THEY GET SOMETHING,

864
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,696
THAT'’S ALL THAT MATTERS.

865
00:31:10,696 --> 00:31:12,629
- ALL THE ONES
I SAW I SWEAR SAID CONDITIONER.

866
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:14,148
- YOU WERE THE ONE
THAT DID THAT.

867
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:15,943
- I WAS THINKING, IN MY HEAD,
WHY ARE THEY ALL CONDITIONER?

868
00:31:15,943 --> 00:31:17,979
- AND YOU'’RE THE MAID OF HONOR.

869
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:20,016
- I THINK THAT MEANS
STEPHANIE'’S DEMOTED.

870
00:31:20,016 --> 00:31:22,190
IF ANYONE AGREES.
- YOU CAN HAVE MY JOB, TRUST ME.

871
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:23,709
- STEPHANIE JUST FELL
OUT OF FIRST PLACE,

872
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:26,677
AND I'’M COMING IN HOT.
- [bleep] IDIOTS.

873
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:28,300
YOU'’RE ALL FIRED.

874
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,344
[phone rings]

875
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:40,760
- WHY ARE YOU CALLING ME?

876
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,659
- I GOT SOME STOGIES.

877
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:45,489
NO KID HERE. NO GIRL HERE.

878
00:31:45,489 --> 00:31:48,078
I FIGURED WE'’D HAVE
SOME STOGIES.

879
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:50,529
- OKAY. YOU WANT ME
TO COME OVER THERE, THEN.

880
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,186
- YEAH, COME HERE.
NO ONE'’S HERE. WE CAN GET WILD.

881
00:31:52,186 --> 00:31:54,119
- OKAY. COOL, MAN.

882
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:55,396
ALL RIGHT, I'’LL BE RIGHT THERE.

883
00:31:55,396 --> 00:31:57,639
SO I'’M NOT MUCH
OF A CIGAR SMOKER.

884
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:59,641
JIONNI CLEARLY IS,
'’CAUSE, YOU KNOW,

885
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:01,954
CIGARS HAVE BEEN LINKED
TO STUNTING YOUR GROWTH.

886
00:32:01,954 --> 00:32:03,369
SO...

887
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:05,026
- BRO, WHAT'’S UP?

888
00:32:05,026 --> 00:32:07,063
- THE TRUTH HURTS SOMETIMES,
MY FRIEND.

889
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:09,306
- MY DAD SMOKES CIGARS, OKAY?

890
00:32:09,306 --> 00:32:11,136
HE'’S 5'’2".
- I REST MY CASE.

891
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:13,759
- MY GRANDFATHER SMOKES CIGARS.
HE'’S 5'’3".

892
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,211
- THERE YOU GO.

893
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:18,660
- SO HOW'’S IT GOING?

894
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,317
- SO IT IS THE GREATEST THING

895
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:21,767
THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE,

896
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:23,596
HANDS DOWN, BAR NONE.
- YEAH?

897
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:24,873
- LITERALLY.

898
00:32:24,873 --> 00:32:26,220
I'’M SO OBSESSED WITH HER
YOU CAN'’T IMAGINE.

899
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,669
I DON'’T WANT TO BE AWAY FROM HER
FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR.

900
00:32:27,669 --> 00:32:30,189
IT'’S CRAZY. I'’M SO IN LOVE
WITH THAT LITTLE GIRL.

901
00:32:30,189 --> 00:32:31,673
- GOOD FEELING.

902
00:32:31,673 --> 00:32:32,778
- I LOVE CLEANING HER POOP.

903
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:34,193
THAT'’S HOW MUCH I LOVE HER.

904
00:32:34,193 --> 00:32:36,747
WELL, SHE'’S A GIRL, SO
SOMETIMES IT GETS ON HER--HER--

905
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:38,301
- CHOCHA?
- CHOCHA.

906
00:32:38,301 --> 00:32:39,440
- YOU WIPE UP OR DOWN?

907
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,889
- YOU HAVE TO WIPE AWAY.

908
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:42,374
YOU CAN'’T WIPE TOWARDS IT. YEAH.
- WIPE DOWN?

909
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:45,964
LORENZO GETS POOP ALL OVER
HIS WIENER AND BELLY BUTTON.

910
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,724
- [laughs]

911
00:32:47,724 --> 00:32:48,690
- YOU'’RE--
[laughter in background]

912
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,278
WHAT THE [bleep] IS THAT?

913
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:53,902
- CREEPY-ASS DOLL BEHIND YOU.
WHY IS THAT THERE?

914
00:32:53,902 --> 00:32:56,112
- WHY DID THAT JUST GO OFF?

915
00:32:56,112 --> 00:32:57,285
ARE YOU [bleep] WITH ME?

916
00:32:57,285 --> 00:32:58,942
- YEAH, I GOT A REMOTE CONTROL
IN MY CIGAR.

917
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:02,704
THIS CREEPY DOLL LITERALLY
SHOWED UP OUT OF NOWHERE.

918
00:33:02,704 --> 00:33:04,637
IT WASN'’T THERE WHEN I SAT DOWN,
I'’M ALMOST POSITIVE.

919
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:06,501
- DO YOU KNOW I'’M SLEEPING
BY MYSELF TONIGHT?

920
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,124
- I DIDN'’T EVEN SEE IT
WHEN I GOT OUT HERE.

921
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:09,608
- ME NEITHER. THAT WASN'’T THERE
THE WHOLE TIME?

922
00:33:09,608 --> 00:33:10,712
- I DIDN'’T SEE IT.

923
00:33:10,712 --> 00:33:11,886
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?

924
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:13,370
HAVE YOU--
HAD YOU SEEN IT PRIOR TO THAT?

925
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,613
- NO.
- SO WEIRD.

926
00:33:14,613 --> 00:33:16,546
- I'’M TELLING YOU,
THERE'’S THINGS AMONG US.

927
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:17,857
- [laughs]

928
00:33:17,857 --> 00:33:19,549
WHERE DID IT COME FROM,
AND WHY IS IT MAKING NOISES?

929
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:23,208
- ONE OF THE GAY JOEYS
PROBABLY BROUGHT IT.

930
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:25,693
[doll laughs]

931
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:33,390
- SHOULD HAVE LEFT
MY HAIR DIRTY.

932
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,633
IT WOULD'’VE CURLED BETTER.

933
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:36,255
I KNEW IT.
- MAMA.

934
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:38,844
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HUH?

935
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:41,053
LET ME SEE
YOUR WRESTLING STANCE.

936
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:43,021
YEAH!

937
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,677
- I'’M GONNA LEAVE NOW,
ALL RIGHT?

938
00:33:44,677 --> 00:33:46,058
- YEAH.

939
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,508
- AND I'’LL MEET YOU OVER THERE.
HOPEFULLY, SHORTLY.

940
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:50,683
- WHERE'’S LORENZO?
- HE'’S RIGHT HERE.

941
00:33:50,683 --> 00:33:51,788
- I GOTTA GET A Q-TIP.

942
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:54,032
- GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING.

943
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,240
- LORENZO.

944
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,069
YOU GOTTA GET READY.
- NO.

945
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,830
- HAPPY BRIDAL SHOWER DAY!

946
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,073
- CAN YOU GET HIM READY?

947
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:03,386
GET IT TOGETHER, LORENZO.
LET'’S GO.

948
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:04,939
- NO.
- YES.

949
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:06,734
YOU'’RE NOT GONNA MAKE ME LATE
FOR MOMMY'’S BRIDAL SHOWER.

950
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:09,668
I DEFINITELY JUST GIVE UP
WITH LORENZO SOMETIMES.

951
00:34:09,668 --> 00:34:11,497
HE'’S BEEN A LITTLE BRAT LATELY,

952
00:34:11,497 --> 00:34:13,810
SO YOU BASICALLY
JUST HAVE TO LET HIM GO

953
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,363
AND DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

954
00:34:15,363 --> 00:34:17,296
I MEAN, HE'’S A TODDLER NOW,
SO IT'’S DEFINITELY HARDER.

955
00:34:17,296 --> 00:34:19,954
- [wails]
- COME ON, LORENZO.

956
00:34:19,954 --> 00:34:22,922
- [sighs]

957
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:26,995
- YOU'’RE NOT GONNA MAKE THIS
EASY, ARE YOU?

958
00:34:26,995 --> 00:34:28,997
- I'’M SO EXCITED
JUST TO GET TO MY BRIDAL SHOWER,

959
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:31,724
FIRST, BECAUSE I JUST
WANT TO MAKE SURE

960
00:34:31,724 --> 00:34:33,001
ALL THE DECORATIONS LOOK GOOD,

961
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:35,487
EVERYTHING LOOKS SET
BEFORE EVERYBODY GETS THERE.

962
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:37,316
SO I JUST HOPE
ALL MY BRIDESMAIDS ARE THERE

963
00:34:37,316 --> 00:34:38,490
BECAUSE THEY HAVE WORK TO DO.

964
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,492
READY, KIDS?
- READY.

965
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:42,390
- LET'’S GET THIS PARTY STARTED.

966
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:50,605
- YEAH.

967
00:34:50,605 --> 00:34:52,055
[indistinct chatter]

968
00:34:55,196 --> 00:34:56,232
- WE'’RE GOOD.

969
00:34:56,232 --> 00:34:57,371
COME ON, WE'’RE GONNA GO INSIDE.

970
00:34:57,371 --> 00:34:58,613
GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

971
00:34:58,613 --> 00:35:01,651
- YOU MIGHT WANNA--

972
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:04,826
- MAYBE ON THE NAPKINS BETTER.

973
00:35:04,826 --> 00:35:06,000
- I HAVE TO POOP.

974
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,245
SO RIGHT WHEN I GET
TO MY BRIDAL SHOWER,

975
00:35:09,245 --> 00:35:11,143
EVERYTHING LOOKS
REALLY, REALLY NICE.

976
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:13,041
I MEAN, IT JUST LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

977
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:15,872
THIS IS MORE
THAN I EXPECTED IT WOULD LOOK.

978
00:35:15,872 --> 00:35:17,805
AND I WAS SCARED IT WAS GONNA
LOOK A LITTLE CHEESY,

979
00:35:17,805 --> 00:35:20,221
BUT IT LITERALLY LOOKS AMAZING.

980
00:35:20,221 --> 00:35:23,155
ALL RIGHT,
LET'’S GET THIS PARTY STARTED.

981
00:35:23,155 --> 00:35:26,227
- OH, THAT'’S A CUTE IDEA
FOR EACH BAG.

982
00:35:26,227 --> 00:35:28,885
- LORENZO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

983
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:32,060
HERE, START--START STUFFING.

984
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,616
LORENZO!

985
00:35:35,616 --> 00:35:37,065
- I WANT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

986
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:38,101
I'’M YOUR MAITRE D'’ FOR TODAY.
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

987
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:39,516
- THIS IS VANESSA,
YOUR HEAD SERVER.

988
00:35:39,516 --> 00:35:41,000
- HI. WHAT'’S A MAITRE D'’?
- HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

989
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,381
- I'’M YOUR BANQUET MANAGER.

990
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:43,762
- SO LIKE MY BITCH.

991
00:35:43,762 --> 00:35:44,935
- KIND OF, YEAH.

992
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:46,351
IF YOU WANT ME TO BE,
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

993
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:51,321
- I GOT A BITCH FOR THE DAY.

994
00:35:51,321 --> 00:35:53,392
MMM, I'’M STARVING.

995
00:35:53,392 --> 00:35:58,225
- ALL RIGHT, HONEY, I'’M GONNA
PUT THIS IN THE FRIDGE.

996
00:35:58,225 --> 00:36:01,538
- BITCH FOR THE DAY.
I LOVE IT.

997
00:36:01,538 --> 00:36:03,644
I DESIGNED THIS,
LIKE, REALLY GOOD.

998
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:04,645
- I KNOW.
- YOU DID.

999
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:09,028
- I SHOULD BE AN EVENT PLANNER.

1000
00:36:09,028 --> 00:36:11,030
HI. HOW ARE YOU?
- HI.

1001
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,239
- WHORES!

1002
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,964
- IT WAS, LIKE, THREE HOURS.
- I LOVE THAT.
