00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:46,336
I CAN'’T TAKE IT.

179
00:06:46,336 --> 00:06:48,615
CAN I LEAVE MY STROLLER
RIGHT HERE?

180
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:52,273
I AM JUST DYING OVER THIS.

181
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:54,966
THIS IS FANCY.

182
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:57,175
IS THIS JUST PAJAMAS?

183
00:06:57,175 --> 00:07:00,592
I'’VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING SO NICE.

184
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:03,492
NOW I KNOW WHY.
THAT IS NOT CHEAP.

185
00:07:03,492 --> 00:07:06,356
I'’M AFRAID TO TOUCH THIS STUFF,
HONEYBUN.

186
00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:09,290
THIS STORE IS VERY HIGH-END.

187
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:11,189

193
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,447
NINE MONTHS.

194
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,689
- WOULD YOU LIKE IT WRAPPED?

195
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:30,829
- YES, PLEASE.

00:07:30,829 --> 00:07:33,729
[baby crying]

197
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:36,697
YOU'’RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THE PERFECT BABY.

198
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:38,561
WHAT'’S GOING ON?
WHAT'’S WRONG?

199
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:40,390

YOU TOOTING?

202
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:46,845
DO YOU HAVE A GARBAGE,
BY ANY CHANCE,

203
00:07:46,845 --> 00:07:49,158
I COULD THROW OUT A DIAPER?

204
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:50,539
I KNOW WHAT'’S GOING ON.

205
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,886
I KNOW--OOP!

206
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:55,923
I KNOW WHY YOU'’RE FUSSING.

207
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:58,305
MEILANI HAS NEVER ACTED OUT,
EVER.

208
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:00,963
BUT MEILANI'’S TOTALLY
BEING A BRAT RIGHT NOW.

I NEED XANAX.

215
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:15,253
THIS BENCH ACTUALLY MIGHT BREAK,

216
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,600
BUT IT'’S ALL RIGHT
AS LONG AS YOU'’RE OKAY.

217
00:08:25,988 --> 00:08:27,230
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

218
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,818
- CALLING JOE.

219
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:30,371
- CROSS YOUR FINGERS.
[line rings]

220
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:33,271
- WHAT'’S GOING ON?
- TALK TO ME.

221
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:34,548
- THE FIRE INSPECTION IS GOOD.

WE'’RE SLEEPING THERE?
- NO, NOT YET.

226
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,935
NOT TILL WE GET THE C.O.
- COME ON.

227
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:43,592
- HOW LONG'’S THAT TAKE?

228
00:08:43,592 --> 00:08:46,802
- TWO WEEKS AWAY MAX,
YOU GUYS WILL BE IN.

229
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:49,529
- IS THERE ANY WAY
IT COULD BE SOONER, LONGER?

230
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,944
- IT'’S OUT OF OUR HANDS NOW.

231
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:52,497
- WHAT IF I WROTE A LETTER
TO THE STATE

232
00:08:52,497 --> 00:08:55,431
SAYING MY FIANCEE'’S
ONE CENTIMETER DILATED?

233
00:08:55,431 --> 00:08:57,640
- ANYTHING THAT CAN HELP,
I'’M ALL FOR IT.

234
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,262
- LET'’S CALL THEM.
- ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

235
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:00,781
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

236
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:02,334
- I'’LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
- BYE.

237
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,853
WE PASSED INSPECTION.
EVERYTHING'’S LIVABLE.

238
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:05,165
EVERYTHING'’S OKAY.

239
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:07,132
NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR
THE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY,

240
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:08,237
THIS C.O. THING.

241
00:09:08,237 --> 00:09:09,549
TWO MORE WEEKS.

242
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,757
- WE'’RE GONNA HAVE THE BABY
HERE.

243
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:12,828
- TWO MORE FRICKING WEEKS.

244
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:14,001
- I'’M GONNA HAVE
TO STERILIZE STUFF.

245
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:15,347
- I CAN'’T LIVE LIKE--
I CAN'’T DO THIS.

246
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,452
- CALL YOUR MOM.

247
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:18,523
WE GOT TO TELL HER
ANOTHER TWO WEEKS.

248
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:21,595
SHE'’S GONNA FREAK OUT.
- MA!

249
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,976
- WHAT IF IT'’S JUST
NOT MEANT TO BE...

250
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,287
- MA!

251
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,427
- AND WE'’RE GONNA
LIVE HERE FOREVER?

252
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:27,774
- WHAT?

253
00:09:27,774 --> 00:09:30,293
- WE JUST TALKED TO JOE,
AND HE SAID ANOTHER TWO WEEKS.

254
00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:32,019
- NO, HE DID NOT.
- YEAH.

255
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:33,020
- YES, HE DID.

256
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,746
- FOR--FOR THE PAPERS.

257
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:37,473
- YOU HAVE EVERYTHING ROLLED UP
AND PACKED AND EVERYTHING.

258
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:38,474
DID HE REALLY SAY THAT?
- YEAH.

259
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:39,509
- HE SAID TWO WEEKS.

260
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,304
TWO WEEKS FOR THE PAPERS.

261
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:43,341
- I CAN'’T BELIEVE
YOU'’RE STILL GONNA BE HERE.

262
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:44,653
- YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

263
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:46,551
- YOU'’RE GONNA STAY
IN THE BASEMENT.

264
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:48,001
OH, MY GOODNESS.

265
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:49,485
TWO MORE WEEKS.

266
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:56,250
- ♪ IT'’S EASY ♪

267
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,667
♪ IT'’S SO EASY ♪

268
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:03,119
- WHAT?

269
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:06,329
- WHY IS IT SO SMALL?

270
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:10,057
- IT'’S SUPPOSED TO BE BIGGER?
- CAN YOUR ASS FIT ON THAT?

271
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:13,889
SO I WAS REALLY EXCITED FOR THIS
COUCH THAT I ORDERED ONLINE,

272
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:16,512
AND IT LOOKED
LIKE A FRICKING DOG COUCH.

273
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,274
THE LITTLE PEG LEGS.

274
00:10:20,274 --> 00:10:21,897
- OH, MY GOD, NICOLE.

275
00:10:21,897 --> 00:10:23,933
- WHAT IS THIS COUCH FOR?

276
00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,625
- OH, MY GOD.
- I'’M DROOLING.

277
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,385
WHO IS THIS FOR?

278
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:28,835
IS THIS FOR CHILDREN?

279
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:30,284
- NICOLE, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

280
00:10:30,284 --> 00:10:31,803
- SOMETIMES WHEN I ORDER THINGS,

281
00:10:31,803 --> 00:10:34,081
I DON'’T REALLY LOOK
AT THE SIZES.

282
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:36,705
- IT'’S LESS THAN A FOOT
OFF THE GROUND.

283
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:37,982
- JUST PUT THE LEG--OH, MY GOD.

284
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:40,916
- LORENZO COULD LITERALLY
JUST STEP ON THIS.

285
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,711
- COULD WE PUT IT
IN YOUR MAN CAVE?

286
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:45,368
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

287
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:46,611
- I GOT TO SHOW YOU THE PICTURE.

288
00:10:46,611 --> 00:10:48,371
IT WAS, LIKE, IN A LIVING ROOM.

289
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:50,235
IT LOOKED SO CLASSY.

290
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:52,997
- OH, MY GOD.

291
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:54,481
- DOESN'’T THAT LOOK SO GRAND?

292
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:56,483
- "THE COUCH IN THE PICTURE
IS WAY SMALLER

293
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:57,933
THAN YOU MIGHT THINK IT IS."

294
00:10:57,933 --> 00:11:00,142
- WHO SAID THAT?
- SOME GUY.

295
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:02,006
"VERY NICE BUT VERY SMALL.

296
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:04,008
IT'’S BARELY BIG ENOUGH
FOR A CHILD."

297
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:05,181
OH, MY GOD.

298
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:06,804
DO YOU READ THE REVIEWS?

299
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:09,392
- I THINK I PURCHASED THIS AT,
LIKE, 2:00 IN THE MORNING.

300
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:11,291
- "SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT.
VERY DISAPPOINTED."

301
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,534
- SO EVERYBODY'’S REACTION
IS THE SAME.

302
00:11:13,534 --> 00:11:15,571
- "WHEN MY HUSBAND
FINISHED PUTTING THIS TOGETHER,

303
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,779
"WE WERE BOTH VERY--

304
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,679
EXTREMELY SURPRISED
IN THE SIZE."

305
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,128
- I'’M GONNA GIVE IT
TO NOEL AND BELLA.

00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:23,268
- THE DOGS?

307
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,098
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU, MAN?

308
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:28,135
SO FAR, YOUR MIRRORS ARE TOO BIG
AND YOUR COUCHES ARE TOO SMALL.

309
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:29,205
- [laughing]

310
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:31,104
STOP. IT HURTS.

00:11:31,104 --> 00:11:33,313
I'’M REALLY UPSET
THAT THIS ISN'’T A BIG COUCH,

312
00:11:33,313 --> 00:11:35,073
BECAUSE I LOVED THE STYLE OF IT.

313
00:11:35,073 --> 00:11:36,868
I THOUGHT IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.

314
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:39,699
AND HONESTLY,
IF IT WAS, LIKE, ADULT SIZE,

315
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,356
IT WOULD BE
A NICE-LOOKING LOVE SEAT.

ON THAT WITH YOU.

- BABE, SIT ON IT.
- NO.

319
00:11:45,808 --> 00:11:47,016
- BABE. COME ON.

320
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:49,122

00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:44,177
IF I HAD A CHOICE,
I WOULD LAY IN BED ALL DAY

346
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:46,524
AND I WOULD EAT ICE CREAM
AND I WOULDN'’T DO [bleep].

347
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:48,871
I JUST--
I'’M NOT FEELING IT TODAY.

348
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:51,184
- COME ON, LORENZO.
NANA'’S GOT SO MUCH WORK TO DO.

349
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:52,668
THEY FINALLY LEFT. COME ON.

350
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:57,604
- SO EXCITED TO SEE

351
00:12:57,604 --> 00:12:59,123
WHAT NICOLE AND JIONNI
HAVE DONE WITH THE PLACE.

352
00:12:59,123 --> 00:13:02,160
I'’VE NEVER BEEN HERE, SO I JUST
WANT TO TAKE IT ALL IN.

353
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,644
WHOO-HOO.

354
00:13:03,644 --> 00:13:05,543
- WELCOME.

355
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:06,613
- I LOVE IT.

356
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:07,959
- THERE'’S SO MUCH [bleep] TO DO.

357
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,374
I FEEL LIKE THIS HOUSE,

358
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:12,481
THIS STYLE DEFINITELY FITS
WHO I AM NOW AS A MOM.

359
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:15,346
BUT, LIKE, THINKING OF ME,
LIKE, FOUR YEARS AGO?

360
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:16,899
- CAN YOU IMAGINE THE HOUSE
YOU WOULD HAVE BUILT?

361
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:19,108
- IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A LEOPARD PALACE.

362
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:21,421
I DEFINITELY THINK I STILL
HAVE LEOPARD PRINT IN ME,

363
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:22,974
BUT I'’M GONNA SAVE THAT
FOR MY LITTLE GIRL.

364
00:13:22,974 --> 00:13:24,838
I MEAN, YOU NEVER FULLY
GET RID OF THE LEOPARD.

365
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:25,874
- NO, YOU JUST PASS IT ON.

366
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:27,082
- YOU JUST DIAL IT DOWN
A LITTLE BIT.

367
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:29,394
- YOU PASS IT ON TO YOUR KIDS.
- YUP. MM-HMM.

368
00:13:29,394 --> 00:13:31,086
- WANT TO HELP NANA?
- NO.

369
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:33,329
- YEAH, COME ON.
I'’LL SHOW YOU THE DECORATIONS.

370
00:13:33,329 --> 00:13:34,986
COME ON.

371
00:13:37,264 --> 00:13:38,956
DON'’T. ARE YOU CRAZY?

372
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:40,026
YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT TOOK ME

373
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:41,613
TO PUT THIS STUPID THING
TOGETHER?

374
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:46,929
LET GO. LET GO.

375
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:50,899
- JIONNI?
- YO.

376
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,487
- ARE THESE GOLDFISH OKAY?
- YEAH.

377
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:54,661
- DID YOUR BACK HURT?

378
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:58,285
LIKE, RIGHT
WHERE MY BUTT CRACK STARTS.

379
00:13:58,285 --> 00:13:59,942
- I HAD, LIKE, A NERVE PAIN.

380
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:02,462
I DID ALL CRAZY [bleep]
TO GET HER OUT.

381
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,636
DID YOU TRY THE BOUNCING BALL
YET, A BIRTHING BALL?

382
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:05,775
- YEAH, THAT [bleep]
DOESN'’T WORK.

383
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,156
- I KNOW. DID YOU TRY--

384
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,571
- I TRIED SPICY FOOD.

385
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:09,849
MY FARTS STUNG AFTER.

386
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,954
THAT'’S THE ONLY THING IT DID.

387
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:13,956
- DID YOU TRY
RUBBING YOUR NIPPLES?

388
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:15,371
- I'’M LIKE,
"WHY AM I DOING THIS?"

389
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:16,786
NO, I WAS LIKE THIS.

390
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:18,167
[laughter]

391
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,618
NOTHING HAPPENED.
I DID IT FOR, LIKE, TEN MINUTES.

392
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:21,999
I'’M GONNA TRY
AND HAVE SEX TONIGHT.

393
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:23,172
- YOU SHOULD.

394
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:24,967
- WE DID THE OTHER DAY,
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.

395
00:14:24,967 --> 00:14:27,452
I READ ONLINE THAT IF YOU GO
UP IN THERE AND TRY

396
00:14:27,452 --> 00:14:31,594
AND TOUCH THE BABY'’S HEAD OR,
YOU KNOW, JUST GO DEEP UP THERE,

397
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:34,045
YOU COULD ACTUALLY START
SOMETHING, SO I TRIED--

398
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:35,426
- I WAS WORRIED ABOUT MY NAILS.

399
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:37,911
- I TRIED TO GET UP THERE,
BUT MY FINGER'’S TOO SHORT.

400
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,948
- YOU DO HAVE A TINY--
- IT'’S A LITTLE SAUSAGE FINGER.

401
00:14:39,948 --> 00:14:41,846
IT DIDN'’T EVEN MAKE IT UP THERE.

402
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:43,606
THEN I FELT LIKE I WAS,
LIKE, BEING A PERVERT.

403
00:14:43,606 --> 00:14:45,436
- PUT YOUR FINGER NEXT TO MINE.

404
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:46,851
- I AM HAVING SEX.

405
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:48,232
- GIRL.

406
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:49,716
LIKE, TWICE.

407
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:50,855
DISGUSTING.

408
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:52,201
- YOU GOT IT GOOD RIGHT NOW.

409
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:54,100
YOU CAN HAVE
SAFE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE.

410
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,308
- I WAS, LIKE,

411
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:56,965
RUBBING MY MAKEUP OFF
FROM A LONG-ASS DAY,

412
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:58,104
AND HE COMES IN THERE.

413
00:14:58,104 --> 00:14:59,484
- LITERALLY.

414
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:02,108
- HE WASN'’T TAKING NO
FOR AN ANSWER.

415
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:04,006
IN THE BATHROOM, OF ALL PLACES.

416
00:15:04,006 --> 00:15:06,250
IT'’S PROBABLY THE ONLY TIME
IN MY LIFE I ACTUALLY SCREAMED.

417
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,183
- ARE YOU ON BIRTH CONTROL?
- NO.

418
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:09,736
- AND YOU'’RE HAVING SEX?
- KIND OF.

419
00:15:09,736 --> 00:15:11,772
- YOU'’RE GONNA GET PREGNANT.
- NO.

420
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,671
- NO?
- I WOULD KILL HIM.

421
00:15:13,671 --> 00:15:15,949
- YOU'’RE VERY FERTILE
AFTER YOU GIVE BIRTH.

422
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,399
- TELL ROGER THAT.

423
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,538
- YOU'’RE NOT ON BIRTH CONTROL,

424
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:21,265
AND YOU'’RE NOT USING CONDOMS,
SO HI.

425
00:15:21,265 --> 00:15:23,543
THAT'’S HOW YOU GET PREGNANT.
- TRY TO TELL HIM.

426
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:25,200
- SO WHY'’D YOU COME
AND SEE ME TODAY?

427
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,892
- '’CAUSE I LOVE YOU,
AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY HI.

428
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:29,204
- ARE [bleep] PREGNANT?

429
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:31,275
- YES,
THAT'’S WHY I SURPRISED YOU.

430
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:33,242
HI, YOU'’RE GONNA BE A GODMOMMY
AGAIN.

431
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:34,347
- NO, ARE YOU KIDDING?

432
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:35,451
- I MEAN, I'’M NOT SURE

433
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:36,728
BECAUSE I HAVEN'’T HAD MY PERIOD,
BUT...

434
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,454
- YOU'’RE PREGNANT.
- I AM NOT [bleep] PREGNANT.

435
00:15:38,454 --> 00:15:40,111
- YOU ARE.
- I WOULD BE CRYING RIGHT NOW.

436
00:15:40,111 --> 00:15:41,354
- JENNI'’S GONNA GET PREGNANT
AGAIN.

437
00:15:41,354 --> 00:15:42,803
- NO, I AM NOT GONNA
GET PREGNANT.

438
00:15:42,803 --> 00:15:44,840
- SHE'’S NOT ON BIRTH CONTROL
AND THEY'’RE DOING IT.

439
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,221
- I WILL NOT BE PREGNANT AGAIN,

440
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:48,671
'’CAUSE I WOULD JUMP
OFF THE [bleep] BROOKLYN BRIDGE.

441
00:15:48,671 --> 00:15:49,949
- WHY BROOKLYN?
- I DON'’T KNOW.

442
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,053
IT SEEMS HIGH.

443
00:15:51,053 --> 00:15:52,296
- SO MY MOM JUST CALLED.

444
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:53,573
THEY'’RE READY FOR LUNCH,
IF YOU WANT.

445
00:15:53,573 --> 00:15:54,746
- YEAH, I CAN EAT AGAIN.

446
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,472
- I THINK SHE MADE BEET SALAD.

447
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:58,336
- ANYTHING JANIS MAKES
IS AMAZING.

448
00:16:00,062 --> 00:16:02,064
- COME ON, LET'’S GO.

449
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:04,342
- LET'’S GO.

450
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:05,378
- SHE'’S HERE. SHE'’S HERE.

451
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:06,966
SHE'’S JUST PULLING IN.

452
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:10,279
- [groans]
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

453
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,764
- I'’M NOT FEELING SO GOOD.

454
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,559
- SHH, SHH, SHH.

455
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,216
- MY TUMMY HURTS.

456
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:18,494
- WHAT IS SHE DOING?
- SHH.

457
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:24,845
all: SURPRISE!

458
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:27,779
- OH, MY GOD.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

459
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,575
WHAT IS THIS?
- YOUR SPRINKLE.

460
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:31,714
- OH, I GOT TO [bleep].

461
00:16:31,714 --> 00:16:33,164
[laughter]

462
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:39,791
- THANKS, GUYS.
HI, NANNY.

463
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,655
I SEE LITERALLY,
LIKE, 20 PEOPLE.

464
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:43,416
I SEE STEPH. I SEE MY MOM.

465
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,934
I SEE MY SISTER-IN-LAWS.

466
00:16:44,934 --> 00:16:47,558
I SEE EVERYBODY, BALLOONS,
A CANDY BAR.

467
00:16:47,558 --> 00:16:50,009
IT TOOK ME A MINUTE
TO COMPREHEND WHAT WAS GOING ON,

468
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,941
AND I'’M PISSED THAT I DIDN'’T
GO INTO LABOR BECAUSE,

469
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:53,943
YOU KNOW, THEY SCARED ME.

470
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:55,428
BUT, I MEAN, OVERALL,

471
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,499
I'’M JUST REALLY, REALLY HAPPY
THAT, YOU KNOW,

472
00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:00,053
THEY DECIDED TO THROW ME
A LITTLE SPRINKLE PARTY.

473
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:02,607
- I TOOK A HALF A DAY YESTERDAY
TO DO EVERYTHING,

474
00:17:02,607 --> 00:17:05,265
AND THEN YOU END UP
STAYING HOME ALL DAY.

475
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:08,096
- I HAVE NO IDEA HOW I DIDN'’T
KNOW ANY OF THIS WAS GOING ON.

476
00:17:08,096 --> 00:17:10,857
I JUST FEEL LIKE I'’VE BEEN
SO WRAPPED UP IN BEING PREGNANT

477
00:17:10,857 --> 00:17:13,894
AND BEING MISERABLE THAT
I PROBABLY MISSED ALL THE SIGNS

478
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:15,241
THAT EVERYBODY
WAS THROWING AT ME.

479
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:17,622
I'’M JUST SO GRATEFUL
TO HAVE THEM IN MY LIFE,

480
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:19,555
AND NOW IT'’S TIME
TO OPEN PRESENTS,

481
00:17:19,555 --> 00:17:22,006
AND, I MEAN,
WHO DOESN'’T LOVE PRESENTS?

482
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,802
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
DID YOU MAKE THIS?

483
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:26,597
YOU MADE THIS?
- YOU MADE THAT?

484
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:28,840
- OH, MY GOD, I LOVE IT.

485
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,083
- IT'’S PRETTY.

486
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,843
- I'’M GETTING SUCH CUTE GIFTS
RIGHT NOW,

487
00:17:31,843 --> 00:17:33,500
AND I'’M JUST NOT USED TO SEEING,

488
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,090
LIKE, ALL THIS PINK
AND LEOPARD AND BOWS

489
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,643
THAT, YOU KNOW,
IT'’S, LIKE, HITTING ME

490
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:39,955
THAT I'’M GONNA HAVE
A LITTLE GIRL

491
00:17:39,955 --> 00:17:43,234
AND I CAN DRESS HER UP
IN GIRLY THINGS.

492
00:17:43,234 --> 00:17:45,409
OH, MY GOD.

493
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:47,169
- SHE'’LL BE A LITTLE OLDER
IN IT.

494
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:49,240
- OH, HOW PRETTY IS THAT?
- THAT'’S GORGEOUS.

495
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,690
- YOU LIKE IT?
- THANK YOU.

496
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,863
- SO PRETTY, SO SOFT.

497
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:53,244
- YEAH.
- IT'’S BEAUTIFUL.

498
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:54,763
- I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT.

499
00:17:54,763 --> 00:17:57,179
LORENZO LOOKS LIKE MOMMY NOW.

500
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,147
- CAN I SEE?

501
00:17:59,147 --> 00:18:01,494
- LORENZO LOOKS LIKE MOM.

502
00:18:01,494 --> 00:18:02,909
- THIS SPRINKLE IS DEFINITELY

503
00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:05,291
TAKING MY MIND
OFF OF EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW,

504
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:07,500
WITH THE HOUSE AND THE WEDDING,

505
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,193
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE RIGHT NOW,
I'’M JUST IN ANOTHER PLACE,

506
00:18:11,193 --> 00:18:12,367
A HAPPY PLACE,

507
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:14,403
AND I'’M NOT STRESSED OUT
RIGHT NOW.

508
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:15,956
- AFTER THIS WEEK,
YOU CAN HAVE IT NOW.

509
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:17,372
- OH, OKAY.
I'’M GOOD NOW.

510
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:19,822
- WE WERE JUST HOLDING--WE
WERE JUST HOLDING OUT FOR TODAY.

511
00:18:19,822 --> 00:18:22,825
WE DON'’T CARE WHAT YOU DO NOW.
- I TRIED THE SWINGS.

512
00:18:22,825 --> 00:18:24,862
- SHE TRIED GALLOPING.
- GALLOPING.

513
00:18:24,862 --> 00:18:26,415
- CAN YOU SHOW ME THIS?

514
00:18:26,415 --> 00:18:29,591
- I'’VE BEEN DOING EVERYTHING TO
TRY AND GET MYSELF INTO LABOR.

515
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:31,351
I MEAN, SOMETHING
HAS GOT TO WORK,

516
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:33,319
AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.

517
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:37,495
- THIS IS HOW WE DO IT.

518
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:39,497
- AND THEN THERE'’S ANOTHER ONE.

519
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:43,743
YOU GET ON ALL FOURS,
AND THEN YOU...

520
00:18:43,743 --> 00:18:44,709
THAT DOESN'’T WORK.

521
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:45,745
- I THINK ALL THAT HELPS

522
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:46,746
WHEN YOU'’RE ACTUALLY IN LABOR,

523
00:18:46,746 --> 00:18:48,610
TO, LIKE, PUSH THE LABOR ALONG.

524
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:50,715
- YEAH, WELL...
- LIKE, GALLOP IN THE HOSPITAL.

525
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:51,682
- THAT [bleep] DOESN'’T WORK.

526
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:53,166
- NOTHING WORKS.

527
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,030
EAT ALL THE [bleep]
PINEAPPLE IN THE WORLD,

528
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,170
RUB YOUR NIPPLES ALL DAY
IF YOU WANT,

529
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,723
IT AIN'’T GONNA
STIMULATE [bleep].

530
00:18:58,723 --> 00:19:00,139
- NOPE.

531
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,417
- YOU'’RE GONNA HAVE SOME
NICE BOOBS FOR YOUR WEDDING.

532
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:03,832
- BIG BOOBS.

533
00:19:03,832 --> 00:19:05,351
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT YOUR BOOBS?

534
00:19:05,351 --> 00:19:07,007
- WELL, I WANT IT TIGHTER,
LIKE, ALL AROUND.

535
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:08,526
- ARE YOU GETTING YOUR BOOBS
DONE BEFORE THE WEDDING?

536
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:09,838
- I WAS THINKING THAT.

537
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:12,392
- YOUR BOOBS ARE ALREADY SO HUGE
TO BEGIN WITH.

538
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:13,600
- WHEN I WAS BREAST-FEEDING--

539
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,015
- YOU'’RE GONNA BE
WALKING AROUND,

540
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:17,086
AND YOUR BOOBS WILL ENTER
THE ROOM BEFORE YOU DO.

541
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:19,158
- [bleep] YES.

542
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,678
I WANT THEM THE WAY THEY LOOKED
WHEN I WAS BREAST-FEEDING.

543
00:19:22,678 --> 00:19:24,439
- OH.
- DID YOU EVER--

544
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:25,992
WHEN THEY, LIKE, GET REALLY--
- YES.

545
00:19:25,992 --> 00:19:27,511
- I WAS LIKE, "COME ON."

546
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:28,960
I TOOK A PICTURE,
AND I WAS LIKE,

547
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,652
"I WANT THAT, PLEASE."

548
00:19:30,652 --> 00:19:31,722
- IT'’S PROBABLY LIKE THIS.

549
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:35,243
[laughter]

550
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:38,522
- I AM SO HAPPY
THAT THE DAY WENT FLAWLESS,

551
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:40,903
AND IT WAS PERFECT, AND I LOVE
YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

552
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:42,664
- I'’M REALLY HAPPY
THAT YOU CAME UP.

553
00:19:42,664 --> 00:19:43,803
- YEAH. OF COURSE.

554
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:45,045
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

555
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:46,495
- '’CAUSE IF IT WERE MY CHOICE,

556
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:48,808
I PROBABLY WOULDN'’T SEE YOU
UNTIL AFTER I GAVE BIRTH.

557
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:51,707
I'’M SUCH A MISERABLE BITCH
RIGHT NOW THAT I'’M, LIKE--

558
00:19:51,707 --> 00:19:52,881
- YOU HAD A GOOD TIME
THOUGH, NO?

559
00:19:52,881 --> 00:19:54,020
- YEAH.

560
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,505
NO, I DID.

561
00:19:56,505 --> 00:19:57,679
I JUST WANT THIS BABY OUT.

562
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,439
THAT'’S ALL I'’M THINKING ABOUT.

563
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,130
- WERE YOU REALLY SURPRISED?

564
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,788
- YES.
- YEAH?

565
00:20:03,788 --> 00:20:05,997
- I HAD NO IDEA.

566
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,792
- DID YOU WANT, LIKE,
A LITTLE SHOWER?

567
00:20:07,792 --> 00:20:08,862
- A LITTLE SPRINKLE? YEAH.

568
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:10,795
- SPRINKLE.

569
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:12,901
- WAS IT YOUR IDEA?
- YUP.

570
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:15,455
- NO.
YOUR MOM SAID IT WAS HER IDEA.

571
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:16,801
I HEARD IT WAS JANELLE'’S IDEA.

572
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:17,871
- WELL, IT WAS EVERYBODY.

573
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:20,046
YOUR MOM TALKED ABOUT IT,
JANELLE.

574
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:21,565
- BOOP!

575
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:23,291
- EVEN THOUGH NICOLE
WASN'’T FEELING WELL

576
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,500
AND, YOU KNOW,
SHE'’S BEEN IN PAIN,

577
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,398
I THINK
IT REALLY HELPED, YOU KNOW,

578
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:29,400
SEEING HER FRIENDS, HER FAMILY,

579
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,506
AND, YOU KNOW,
SHE NEEDED SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

580
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:34,336
- YOU HAVE FUN AT THE PARTY
TODAY?

581
00:20:34,336 --> 00:20:36,580
I WALKED IN.
HE WENT, "SURPRISE."

582
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,960
- LORENZO SAID, "SURPRISE."

583
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,413
- LORENZO, WHAT'’D YOU DO
WHEN I WALKED IN THE HOUSE?

584
00:20:42,413 --> 00:20:45,174
- '’PRISE!

585
00:20:45,174 --> 00:20:47,487
- YOU SAID, "SURPRISE"?
- YOU'’RE SO CUTE.

586
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,421
YOU SAID, "SURPRISE, MAMA,"
RIGHT?

587
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:53,182
WHAT'’D YOU SAY?
- '’PRISE.

588
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:54,839
- YOU'’RE A GOOD KID, LORENZO.

589
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,255
- YOU'’RE GOOD.
SMART TOO.

590
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,084
I LOVE YOU.
- YOUR DAD TAUGHT YOU WELL.

591
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,258
- '’PRISE.

592
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:05,229
- ♪ IS THIS LOVE
I'’VE FOUND AGAIN ♪

593
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:06,955
♪ OR IS THIS LOVE
FOR THE FIRST TIME ♪

594
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:08,612
- NICOLE, DO YOU HAVE
GOOD HAIR SPRAY?

595
00:21:08,612 --> 00:21:10,027
- YEAH,
ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE GOOD.

596
00:21:10,027 --> 00:21:11,477
- NONE OF THEM ARE HARD.
- THE PINK.

597
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:13,237
THAT'’S WHAT SHE SAID.
- THAT'’S WHAT SHE SAID.

598
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:15,791
- TONIGHT WE ARE GOING OUT
TO DINNER WITH JENNI AND ROGER

599
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,206
BECAUSE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

600
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:19,761
WHAT WE WANT TO PUT
ON OUR MENU FOR THE WEDDING.

601
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:22,867
SO IT'’S A LITTLE WEDDING
TASTING DINNER.

602
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:25,284
WHAT IF I EAT A LOT AND THEN
I GIVE--I GO INTO LABOR?

603
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,699
I'’M GONNA POOP EVERYWHERE.

604
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:28,114
[laughs]

605
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:32,291
YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL
IN THOSE HEELS HOLDING HER.

606
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,706
- I KNOW, BUT SHE HAS TO BURP.

607
00:21:33,706 --> 00:21:35,846
- YOU HAVE SIX-INCH HEELS ON.

608
00:21:35,846 --> 00:21:38,089
- NICOLE AND I DEFINITELY
HAVEN'’T SPENT ENOUGH TIME

609
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:41,265
ON THE WEDDING AND WHAT WE
WANT TO EAT AND THE MENU.

610
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:43,750
SO THIS IS DEFINITELY A GOOD
IDEA FOR US TO GO OUT TONIGHT

611
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,028
AND TRY DIFFERENT VARIETIES
OF FOOD

612
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:47,789
AND JUST GET, YOU KNOW,
A GENERAL IDEA,

613
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:50,826
AND IT'’S REALLY GOOD HAVING
JENNI AND ROGER WITH US TO,

614
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:52,794
YOU KNOW, GIVE US THEIR OPINION.

615
00:21:52,794 --> 00:21:55,969
- WHY IS THERE
SO MUCH SILVERWARE?

616
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:58,800
WHAT ARE THESE FOR, LORENZO?

617
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,871
THERE'’S LITTLE SILVERWARES,
AND THEN THERE'’S, LIKE,

618
00:22:00,871 --> 00:22:03,460
THREE FORKS,
THREE SPOONS, THREE KNIVES,

619
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,429
A MILLION GLASSES WITH
WINE GLASSES AND REGULAR CUPS.

620
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:08,568
IT'’S CONFUSING.

621
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:10,432
- THIS IS A CHARDONNAY.

622
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:13,470
- I COULD SMELL THEM.

623
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,092
- I FORGOT WHICH ONE'’S WHAT.

624
00:22:15,092 --> 00:22:16,818
- THAT'’S A CHARDONNAY, YOU SAID?

625
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:18,440
- THIS IS A ROSE.
- OH, A ROSE.

626
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,269
- WHAT DO WE DO?
LIKE, TAKE SHOTS?

627
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:22,306
- I JUST TOOK A SIP
OF EVERYTHING.

628
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:24,239
- OOP, ALREADY DRUNK.

629
00:22:24,239 --> 00:22:25,620
- ARE YOU--
- ONE OF THE MUST BE A MERLOT.

630
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,069
- ARE YOU A BIG WINE DRINKER?

631
00:22:27,069 --> 00:22:29,451
- NOT AT ALL.

632
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:30,970
- THAT SMELLS GOOD.

633
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:33,179
A LITTLE--A LITTLE SWEET.
- YOU TAKING NOTES?

634
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,009
- OKAY, THIS IS THE CHARDONNAY.

635
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:39,772
I DON'’T KNOW
HOW TO SPELL "CHARDONNAY."

636
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:41,256
- I MEAN,
NONE OF US AT THE TABLE

637
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:43,603
ARE AWESOME SPELLING BEE
STUDENTS,

638
00:22:43,603 --> 00:22:45,433
BUT I MEAN,
AS LONG AS IT TASTES GOOD,

639
00:22:45,433 --> 00:22:46,813
WHO CARES HOW IT'’S SPELLED?

640
00:22:46,813 --> 00:22:48,159
- THE BURRATA MOZZARELLE.

641
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,748
IT'’S A BURRATA STUFFED
WITH A CREAMY CENTER,

642
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:53,441
WRAPPED IN PROSCIUTTO DI PARMA
AND HOMEMADE ROASTED PEPPERS.

643
00:22:53,441 --> 00:22:54,787
THIS IS OUR SPRING SALAD.

644
00:22:54,787 --> 00:22:58,273
IT'’S A MIXED BABY GREEN
SERVED WITH CANDIED PECANS,

645
00:22:58,273 --> 00:23:00,102
GOAT CHEESE, TOMATO, ONION,

646
00:23:00,102 --> 00:23:01,449
AND GOLDEN RAISINS.

647
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:03,278
- OH, MY GOD.

648
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:05,453
- EVERYBODY WRITE DOWN...
- WHAT YOU LIKE?

649
00:23:05,453 --> 00:23:07,282
- WHICH OUT--WHICH OUTFITS.

650
00:23:07,282 --> 00:23:09,077
WHICH FOODS YOU LOVE THE BEST.

651
00:23:09,077 --> 00:23:10,941
I LOVE THIS MOZZARELLE THING.

652
00:23:10,941 --> 00:23:12,149
- THAT MOZZARELLA BALL?

653
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:13,875
BUT THIS ONE'’S REALLY GOOD,
WITH THE PECANS.

654
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,117
- YEAH.

655
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:16,671
- THAT WAS PROSCIUTTE
AND MOZZARELLE, RIGHT?

656
00:23:16,671 --> 00:23:17,844
- YEAH.
- WRITE THAT DOWN, BABE.

657
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:18,949
- HOW THE HELL
DO YOU SPELL "PROSCIUTTE"?

658
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:20,157
- HOW DO YOU SPELL "PROSCIUTTE"?
- P-R-U--

659
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:21,641
- "PRUH-ZHOOT."

660
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:22,849
- ANY SELF-RESPECTING ITALIAN

661
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:24,713
WOULD KNOW HOW TO SPELL
"PROSCIUTTE."

662
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:26,163
I'’M NOT ITALIAN.
HOW DO YOU SPELL IT?

663
00:23:26,163 --> 00:23:28,510
- B-R--
- U.

664
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,511
- U.
- S.

665
00:23:29,511 --> 00:23:31,099
- I GOT THAT FAR.
- J.

666
00:23:31,099 --> 00:23:32,997
- I THINK IT'’S A S, ACTUALLY.
I DON'’T THINK IT'’S--

667
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:34,620
- IS IT "BROSCUITTE"
OR "PROSCIUTTO"?

668
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,724
- IT'’S B.

669
00:23:35,724 --> 00:23:37,519
B-R-U-S-J.

670
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:38,693
- NO.

671
00:23:38,693 --> 00:23:40,211
IT'’S PRONOUNCED
WITH, LIKE, A B,

672
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,558
LIKE, "BROSCIUTTE."

673
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:42,869
- YEAH, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS PRONOUNCED "BROSCIUTTE."

674
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:44,077
- BUT IT LOOKS
LIKE "PRAH-SCOOT-OH"

675
00:23:44,077 --> 00:23:45,078
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

676
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:47,874
B-R-U-S-H-E-T-T-I.

677
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:49,428
- THAT'’S IT?

678
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,360
- "BRUSCHETTA."
- "BRUSCHUTE."

679
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,984
- IT'’S "BRUSCHETTA."
IT'’S NOT "BRUSCHUTE" RIGHT?

680
00:23:53,984 --> 00:23:55,468
- I DON'’T HAVE A CLUE.

681
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:58,333
I DON'’T CARE HOW TO SPELL,
BECAUSE I JUST LIKE EATING IT.

682
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,680
I CAN SAY IT.

683
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,061
- WE HAVE OUR CAJUN CALAMARI.

684
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:03,718
IT'’S A SPICY BALSAMIC.
- OH, WOW, HERE WE GO.

685
00:24:03,718 --> 00:24:05,202
- CAN YOU TELL ME
HOW SPICY IT IS?

686
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:07,584
- OH, MY GOD,
THE SHRIMP'’S SPICY.

687
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:08,688
MM!

688
00:24:08,688 --> 00:24:10,414
[laughter]

689
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:12,830
- HOT?
- IT'’S TOO HOT FOR ME.

690
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,866
- THAT WAS PRETTY AWESOME.

691
00:24:13,866 --> 00:24:14,867
- [coughs]

692
00:24:14,867 --> 00:24:16,144
[laughter]

693
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:17,663
- WHAT HAPPENED?

694
00:24:17,663 --> 00:24:20,804
- THAT BAD?

695
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:23,013
IT'’S A SPICY MEATBALL-A.

696
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:25,464
THAT'’S AMORE.
- OH, GOD.

697
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,879
WHO AM I WITH?

698
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,674
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WE HAVE SOME PASTA FOR YOU.

699
00:24:28,674 --> 00:24:30,503
- OH.
- THREE DIFFERENT KINDS.

700
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,471
- I CAN'’T EAT ANY MORE.

701
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,541
REALLY GOOD.

702
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:35,232
- YEAH, LINGUINE, I LOVE.

703
00:24:35,232 --> 00:24:37,614
- IS THIS SPICY?

704
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:39,098
I'’M SO FULL.

705
00:24:39,098 --> 00:24:40,479
- UH-OH, HERE COMES THE DESSERT.

706
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,825
- OH, I CAN'’T. DESSERT? OH.

707
00:24:41,825 --> 00:24:43,827
- A LITTLE PALATE CLEANSER.

708
00:24:43,827 --> 00:24:45,898
- OH, PALATE CLEANSER?
THAT MEANS THERE'’S MORE TO COME.

709
00:24:45,898 --> 00:24:47,796
- WAIT.
WHAT'’S A PALATE CLEANSER?

710
00:24:47,796 --> 00:24:49,453
- IT MAKES YOU GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

711
00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:51,075
- IT MAKES YOU GO POOPS?

712
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:52,352
[laughter]

713
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:54,251
I THINK YOU USE
THE LITTLE SPOON.

714
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,667
- YEAH.
- THAT'’S OUR CHILEAN SEA BASS.

715
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:57,944
IT'’S OVER A SAUTEED SPINACH

716
00:24:57,944 --> 00:24:59,981
TOPPED WITH A SWEET
MASHED POTATO CRUST.

717
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:01,534
- CHILEAN SEA BASS?

718
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:02,639
I'’M CHILEAN.

719
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:04,226
- IF YOU DON'’T HAVE A FISH
PICKED,

720
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:05,642
THIS IS, LIKE, MY FAVORITE ONE.

721
00:25:05,642 --> 00:25:07,471
IT DOESN'’T EVEN TASTE LIKE FISH.

722
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:10,129
- THAT'’S WHAT SHE SAID.
- IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.

723
00:25:10,129 --> 00:25:12,925
- I DON'’T LIKE FISH.
- IT DOESN'’T TASTE LIKE FISH.

724
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:22,935
- IS IT GOOD?
- IT TASTES LIKE FISH.

725
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:24,143
YOU SAID
IT DIDN'’T TASTE LIKE FISH,

726
00:25:24,143 --> 00:25:25,316
AND I'’M EATING IT;
IT TASTES LIKE FISH.

727
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,283
- IT DOESN'’T HAVE
A GAMY FISH TASTE.

728
00:25:26,283 --> 00:25:27,353
- I DON'’T LIKE FISH.

729
00:25:27,353 --> 00:25:29,044
- AND IT'’S FROM CHILE.

730
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:31,150
- OKAY.

731
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,772
DOESN'’T MEAN I HAVE TO EAT IT.
NO.

732
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:34,325
- I DON'’T ACTUALLY KNOW
IF IT'’S FROM CHILE.

733
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,499
- BUT IT'’S CHILEAN SEA BASS.

734
00:25:35,499 --> 00:25:36,914
THAT'’S GOT TO BE FROM CHILE.

735
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:39,538
WELL, FRENCH FRIES
ARE FROM FRANCE.

736
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,850
- ARE THEY?

737
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,024
- I THINK.

738
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:44,370
- I'’M GONNA THROW UP.

739
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,234
- I'’M READY FOR BED.

740
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:48,339
- I'’M DEFINITELY IN A FOOD COMA
RIGHT NOW.

741
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,651
I CAN'’T BREATHE,

742
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:52,827
AND JUST TRYING A LITTLE BIT
OF EVERYTHING KILLED ME.

743
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:54,138
- I'’M STUFFED.

744
00:25:54,138 --> 00:25:55,726
- AND SOMEONE'’S GONNA HAVE
TO ROLL ME OUT OF HERE.

745
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:57,417
- ENJOY EVERYTHING, GUYS?
- EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING.

746
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:58,487
- VEAL WAS MY FAVORITE.

747
00:25:58,487 --> 00:25:59,730
HE LIKED THE SEA BASS.

748
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,388
- AH, THE CHILEAN SEA BASS
WAS TO DIE FOR.

749
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:03,976
- YOU GONNA USE ANYTHING
FOR THE WEDDING?

750
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:05,046
- WE MADE A LIST.

751
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:06,565
- YOU GOT A LIST?
- SO WE'’RE GOOD.

752
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,739
- I'’M GLAD I COULD HELP, AND
I HOPE YOU HAVE THE BABY SOON.

753
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:11,466
- TONIGHT WE'’RE GONNA DO IT.
- POOR THING.

754
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:13,054
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU, GUYS.

755
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:14,883
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- THANK YOU.

756
00:26:14,883 --> 00:26:17,368
- I CAN'’T MOVE.

757
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,853
DO THEY HAVE A WHEELCHAIR?

758
00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:20,855
- GOING TO MARRA'’S WAS
DEFINITELY A SUCCESS TONIGHT.

759
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:22,304
WE GOT GREAT IDEAS.

760
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:25,549
WE TASTED DIFFERENT VARIETIES
OF SALADS, FISHES, MEATS,

761
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:28,345
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT WAS A SUCCESS TONIGHT.

762
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:29,760
- OH, MY GOD.
- OH, MY GOD.

763
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,830
[farts]

764
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,935
- I HEARD THAT.

765
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:32,970
- HEARD WHAT?

766
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:35,317
- YOU FARTED.
[laughs]

767
00:26:37,872 --> 00:26:40,806
- ♪ '’CAUSE I'’M READY ♪

768
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:44,741
♪ OH, I'’M READY ♪

769
00:26:44,741 --> 00:26:46,052
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

770
00:26:46,052 --> 00:26:47,675
- UGH, I GOT TO PUMP.

771
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:48,952
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?

772
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:51,161
- I'’M GETTING REALLY BAD
CONTRACTIONS.

773
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:53,508
I DEFINITELY WANT TO DO THINGS
TO HELP THE PROCESS

774
00:26:53,508 --> 00:26:55,268
AND MOVE IT ALONG.

775
00:26:55,268 --> 00:26:56,994
SO I'’M GRABBING MY BREAST PUMP,

776
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:59,997
AND I'’M GONNA GO IN THE BATHROOM
AND JUST START PUMPING,

777
00:26:59,997 --> 00:27:04,243
BECAUSE ONCE YOU PUMP, THEN,
YOU KNOW, YOUR UTERUS CONTRACTS,

778
00:27:04,243 --> 00:27:08,178
AND I FEEL LIKE THAT
CAN JUMP-START THE PROCESS.

779
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:09,973
TA-DA.
- EW.

780
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:11,353
HOW'’D YOU DO?

781
00:27:11,353 --> 00:27:12,907
- WELL, I GOT SOME MILK
OUT OF IT, WHICH IS GOOD.

782
00:27:12,907 --> 00:27:13,977
- WHY IS IT SO YELLOW?

783
00:27:13,977 --> 00:27:15,081
- IT'’S COLOSTRUM,

784
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:17,497
BEFORE THE MILK ACTUALLY COMES.

785
00:27:17,497 --> 00:27:18,878
- I JUST DRY HEAVED.

786
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:23,089
- COLOSTRUM IS THE YELLOW STUFF,
SO IT'’S BASICALLY, LIKE,

787
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:26,886
THE PRE-MILK
BEFORE YOUR MILK COMES OUT.

788
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:28,785
SHE'’D PROBABLY CHUG THIS
RIGHT AWAY.

789
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:30,545
- I DON'’T WANT TO LOOK AT IT.
- IT'’S ONE OUNCE.

790
00:27:30,545 --> 00:27:32,374
- LISTEN, NICOLE.

791
00:27:32,374 --> 00:27:34,169
YOU WANT TO GO TO THE HOUSE?
- YEAH.

792
00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:35,757
WHY YOU MAKING THAT STINKFACE?

793
00:27:35,757 --> 00:27:37,138
- CAUSE I DON'’T--
I DON'’T KNOW WHY.

794
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:38,553
I GOT, LIKE, A GROSS FEELING.

795
00:27:38,553 --> 00:27:40,313
COLOSTRUM LOOKS PRETTY NASTY.

796
00:27:40,313 --> 00:27:42,315
- IT'’S PRETTY GROSS.

797
00:27:42,315 --> 00:27:43,972
JIONNI, IT'’S MILK.

798
00:27:43,972 --> 00:27:45,042
- IT'’S REALLY YELLOW.

799
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:46,319
- IT'’S COLOSTRUM.

800
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:48,839
- REMINDS ME OF THE MUCUS PLUG.

801
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,530
- HOPEFULLY WE'’LL SEE THAT
TODAY.

802
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,016
I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE GIOVANNA'’S
GONNA COME TONIGHT.

803
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:55,674
I MEAN, THIS PAIN,
I HAVEN'’T REALLY FELT YET,

804
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,159
AND I FEEL LIKE IT JUST
GETS WORSE AND WORSE.

805
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,749
SO I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,
IT'’S GONNA HAPPEN.

806
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:04,441
- MAY THE PUMPING
BE IN YOUR FAVOR.

807
00:28:04,441 --> 00:28:05,684
- IT'’S THE LAST THING.

808
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,964
THEN I'’M GONNA GET
SOME CHAMOMILE TEA.

809
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:12,242
I HEARD THAT WORKS TOO.
- YOU WANT SOME NIP STIM?

810
00:28:12,242 --> 00:28:13,830
- I JUST DID MY NIP STIM.
- OH.

811
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,625
- THEY WERE BEING YANKED ON.

812
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,766
- THAT'’S WHAT SHE SAID.
- ALL RIGHT. YOU'’RE GROSS.

813
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:22,666
- I THOUGHT THAT WAS MY JOB,
TO YANK YOUR NIPPLE.

814
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,012
- NO.

815
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:25,842
- TODAY'’S GONNA BE
ANOTHER BUSY DAY AT THE HOUSE.

816
00:28:25,842 --> 00:28:28,051
WE HAVE A LOT OF UNPACKING,
A LOT OF BUILDING

817
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:29,673
AND PUTTING STUFF TOGETHER.

818
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:31,571
NICOLE AND I ARE GONNA
BE BUSY AGAIN TODAY.

819
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,300
- SHE NEEDS TO BE OUT OF HERE.

820
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,544
I'’M DOING EVERYTHING,
AND SHE'’S NOT COMING OUT.

821
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,376
I'’M GONNA DRINK AS MUCH
CHAMOMILE TEA AS I CAN TODAY.

822
00:28:46,448 --> 00:28:50,004
LET'’S STERILIZE SOME BOTTLES
JUST IN CASE.

823
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:51,660
I'’M NOT FEELING SO HOT.

824
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,696
- WELL, SO RELAX.

825
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:53,939
- NO, I AM.

826
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:57,218
I JUST FEEL LIKE SHE'’S DOWN.

827
00:28:57,218 --> 00:29:00,152
- NICOLE IS JUST
TRYING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE,

828
00:29:00,152 --> 00:29:02,016
AND WITH ALL THESE MYTHS,
I FEEL LIKE

829
00:29:02,016 --> 00:29:04,156
SHE JUST KEEPS TRYING TO INDUCE
HERSELF AND INDUCE HERSELF,

830
00:29:04,156 --> 00:29:05,640
BUT AT THIS POINT,
I GUESS IF SHE'’S

831
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,366
IN THAT BAD OF PAIN,
SHE NEEDS IT.

832
00:29:07,366 --> 00:29:09,540
SO, YOU KNOW,
I'’M THERE FOR HER IF SHE NEEDS--

833
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,921
WHATEVER SHE NEEDS.

834
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:12,681
I JUST WANT HER TO FEEL BETTER
IF SHE'’S IN PAIN.

835
00:29:12,681 --> 00:29:13,717
- I DON'’T FEEL GOOD.

836
00:29:13,717 --> 00:29:14,891
I KEEP GETTING THIS PAIN.

837
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:18,342
- DON'’T DRINK TOO MUCH TEA.

838
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:20,620
- I'’M HAVING SEVERE CRAMPS
RIGHT NOW.

839
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,001
- I WISH SHE DIDN'’T FEEL
LIKE THIS,

840
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:24,279
AND I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW SHE'’S FEELING,

841
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:27,110
AND I JUST WANT HER TO RELAX
AND TAKE IT EASY.

842
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,423
- BABE, CAN YOU GO GET
MY BOUNCY BALL IN THE BACKSEAT?

843
00:29:30,423 --> 00:29:31,562
- WHAT'’S IT FOR?

844
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,495
- SO I CAN BOUNCE ON IT.

845
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:36,913
I FEEL LIKE BOUNCING ON THE BALL
HELPS YOUR CERVIX OPEN

846
00:29:36,913 --> 00:29:39,501
AND YOUR HIPS OPEN.

847
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:43,333
[laughing]

848
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:45,128
THIS IS PERVERTED.

849
00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:47,613
SO RIGHT NOW, I'’M TRYING
TO BLOW UP THIS BOUNCY BALL

850
00:29:47,613 --> 00:29:49,201
WITH THE LITTLE HOSE,

851
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:52,963
AND IT'’S A LITTLE AWKWARD
BECAUSE IT'’S KIND OF SEXUAL.

852
00:29:52,963 --> 00:29:57,623
BABE, LOOK.
NEVER MIND, DON'’T LOOK.

853
00:29:57,623 --> 00:29:58,658
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

854
00:29:58,658 --> 00:29:59,867
- IT WAS A PUMP,
SO I HAD TO, LIKE,

855
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:02,628
HOLD THE PUMP,
AND IT WAS LIKE THIS.

856
00:30:12,776 --> 00:30:15,503
BUT I WAS TRYING TO DO IT, LIKE,
FAST TO GET THE BALL GOING.

857
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:17,919
AND I WAS LIKE--
- THAT'’S USUALLY WHAT YOU DO.

858
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,473
- EW. [laughs]
EW, YOU'’RE SICK.

859
00:30:20,473 --> 00:30:23,683
- THAT WAS SUCH A FAKE LAUGH.
- [laughing]

860
00:30:23,683 --> 00:30:25,444
THIS IS IT?

861
00:30:25,444 --> 00:30:28,171
IT'’S THE SMALLEST BALL
I'’VE EVER SEEN.

862
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:30,449
- THAT'’S WHAT SHE SAID.
- [laughs]

863
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:33,003
WELL, I WAS EXPECTING
THIS BALL TO BE WAY BIGGER,

864
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:35,557
BUT IT'’LL DO THE JOB.

865
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:36,973
YOUR BUTT LOOKS NICE.

866
00:30:36,973 --> 00:30:39,527
- SHUT UP.

867
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:41,046
- LITTLE BUBBLE BUTT.

868
00:30:41,046 --> 00:30:44,083
IS THIS WHAT I'’M SUPPOSED TO DO?

869
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,119
- I DON'’T KNOW.

870
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:47,328
- IT HURTS SO BAD.

871
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:50,296
HOW VIOLENT SHOULD I BOUNCE?

872
00:30:50,296 --> 00:30:52,678
I FEEL PRESSURE IN MY VAGINA.

873
00:30:52,678 --> 00:30:57,338
WHERE ARE YOU?

874
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:09,143
- HOW'’S SHE DOING?
- LOOK.

875
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:10,938
- OH, MY GOD.
SEE, I TOLD YOU, SHE'’S TEETHING.

876
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:12,042
SHE BITES THE BOTTLE.

877
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:15,701
- SHE'’S LIKE A BABY COW.
- [laughs]

878
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:19,291
- OH, THEM EYES
ARE GETTING HEAVY, SO, SO HEAVY.

879
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:20,948
- SHE'’S BEEN UP
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

880
00:31:20,948 --> 00:31:21,983
- SHE'’S SLEEPING.

881
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:23,605
WE COULD GO UPSTAIRS
AND MAKE LOVE.

882
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:26,436
- I HAVE MY PERIOD.

883
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:27,609
- IN 4 1/2 YEARS,

884
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:30,543
JENNI HAS INITIATED
TWO SEXUAL ACTS, TWO.

885
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:32,062
THAT'’S THE TRUTH,
AND SHE CAN'’T ARGUE IT.

886
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:33,684
- BECAUSE YOU ASK
45 TIMES A DAY.

887
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,066
WHAT'’S THE POINT
OF ME INITIATING IT?

888
00:31:36,066 --> 00:31:38,897
- TWICE. 4 1/2 YEARS.

889
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,622
AND IF YOU DIDN'’T HAVE
YOUR PERIOD?

890
00:31:40,622 --> 00:31:42,107
- I HAVE A HEADACHE.

891
00:31:42,107 --> 00:31:43,660
- AND IF YOU DIDN'’T HAVE
A HEADACHE?

892
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,799
- I BROKE A TOE.

893
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,214
- AND IF YOU DIDN'’T BREAK A TOE?

894
00:31:46,214 --> 00:31:49,355
- I STABBED MYSELF IN THE EYE
WITH A FORK.

895
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:51,219
- AND THIS IS THE TRUTH.

896
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:54,050
YOUR IDEA
OF INITIATING A SEXUAL ACT,

897
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,224
IS IT OR IS IT NOT
LAYING FLAT ON YOUR BACK

898
00:31:56,224 --> 00:31:57,329
AND SAYING TO ME,

899
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:58,640
"DO YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX?"

900
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,609
THAT IS YOUR IDEA
OF INITIATING A SEXUAL ACT.

901
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:03,197
AND THEN I'’LL SAY, "SURE!"

902
00:32:03,197 --> 00:32:04,853
AND I'’LL BE LIKE, "OKAY,

903
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:06,407
"I'’LL WAIT HERE
UNTIL SHE DOES SOMETHING.

904
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:07,856
WE'’LL HAVE A STALEMATE HERE."

905
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:10,031
I WOULD BE LAYING THERE
FOR A [bleep] WEEK.

906
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:12,240
SO I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

907
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,828
[laughs]

908
00:32:13,828 --> 00:32:16,175
THIS IS THE HELL
THAT YOUR DADDY LIVES.

909
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:17,694
HE REALLY MUST LOVE YOU.

910
00:32:17,694 --> 00:32:20,214
HE MUST REALLY LOVE YOUR MOMMY.

911
00:32:20,214 --> 00:32:21,870
- I'’M GETTING
REALLY BAD CONTRACTIONS.

912
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,079
- HI, GUYS.

913
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:24,356
- AND HERE'’S ANOTHER ONE.

914
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:26,013
- I JUST HUNG A MIRROR.

915
00:32:26,013 --> 00:32:27,566
- YOU JUST HUNG A MIRROR
BY YOURSELF?

916
00:32:27,566 --> 00:32:29,464
- MM-HMM.
- OH, MY GOD. IT'’S SO PERFECT.

917
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:30,465
- JANIS?

918
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:32,433
- WHOA. YES?

919
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:33,813
I BROUGHT JACKIE.

920
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:35,229
- I'’M HAVING THE BABY.
- WE CAME TO EMPTY THE POD.

921
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:37,196
I FEEL SO BAD.
AND--

922
00:32:37,196 --> 00:32:40,130
- IF I DON'’T GO TONIGHT,
I'’M GONNA HANG MYSELF.

923
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,269
- SHE'’S POOPING.

924
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:42,961
- OH, I THOUGHT
SHE WAS IN HERE--

925
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,963
- HI, JACKS.
- IN THIS ROOM.

926
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,343
- I PUMPED TODAY.
- YOU WHAT?

927
00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:47,551
- I PUMPED TODAY.

928
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,726
I GOT AN OUNCE OUT.

929
00:32:49,726 --> 00:32:51,003
- ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

930
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:53,799
- I'’M SO EXHAUSTED.
I'’M IN PAIN.

931
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:54,903
IT REALLY HURTS.

932
00:32:54,903 --> 00:32:56,284
AND IT'’S REALLY BAD.

933
00:32:56,284 --> 00:32:57,354
I'’M SO OVER IT.

934
00:32:57,354 --> 00:32:58,528
- YOU HAVE TO REST.

935
00:32:58,528 --> 00:32:59,598
- NO.

936
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:01,289
IF I MOVE,
IT MIGHT INDUCE LABOR.

937
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:05,155
I'’M JUST WAITING FOR IT.
IT'’S TORTURE.

938
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:10,195
I'’M GETTING THIS SHARP PAIN,
LIKE, EVERY 12, 13 MINUTES.

939
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:12,231
LORENZO, PULL.
- PULL IT, LORENZO.

940
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:13,681
- LORENZO, PULL.

941
00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:17,581
I LOVE WHEN YOU GUYS ARE HERE.

942
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:19,480
WE GET [bleep] DONE.

943
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,862
STRONG LADIES.

944
00:33:22,862 --> 00:33:25,072
I THINK I'’M GONNA GIVE BIRTH.

945
00:33:25,072 --> 00:33:26,625
- JUST DO IT. IT'’S OKAY.
- REALLY?

946
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,006
- I'’M TRYING. I KEEP PUSHING.

947
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,077
- DON'’T BE PUSHING RIGHT NOW.
- [yells]

948
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:31,699
- YOU'’RE ALL SWEATY AND [bleep].

949
00:33:31,699 --> 00:33:32,665
- NO, I'’M NOT KIDDING.
I'’M PUSHING.

950
00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:33,942
- DON'’T.

951
00:33:33,942 --> 00:33:37,463
YOU MAKE ME SO NERVOUS.
- CUTE PUSHING FACE.

952
00:33:37,463 --> 00:33:39,569
- OOH, YOU SHOULD SEE IT
WHEN I REALLY PUSH.

953
00:33:39,569 --> 00:33:40,777
I GO LIKE THIS.

954
00:33:40,777 --> 00:33:42,606
[laughter]

955
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:43,538
- LET ME SEE?

956
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:48,854
- THIS EPISODE
OF SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW...

957
00:33:48,854 --> 00:33:50,338
- CONTINUES NOW.

958
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,757
- IT'’S SO BAD.

959
00:33:55,757 --> 00:33:57,932
I WOULDN'’T WISH THIS ON ANYONE.

960
00:33:57,932 --> 00:34:00,624
- EMBRACE IT. EMBRACE THE PAIN.
- WHY DON'’T YOU EMBRACE IT?

961
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:03,627
YOU WOULDN'’T LAST
ONE CONTRACTION.

962
00:34:05,802 --> 00:34:08,184
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

963
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:10,531
- I'’M TEN MINUTES APART.

964
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:11,946
- DO YOU THINK
YOU'’RE GONNA GO TONIGHT?

965
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:15,260
- PROBABLY.

966
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,020
- DID YOU EAT?
WANT TO EAT SOMETHING?

967
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,297
- I DON'’T KNOW WHAT I WANT.

968
00:34:18,297 --> 00:34:19,643
- WELL,
YOU HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING.

969
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:21,714
I'’LL MAKE YOU A SALAD
WITH SOME GRILLED CHICKEN?

970
00:34:21,714 --> 00:34:22,888
- NO.

971
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:24,372
- MOZZARELLE STICKS?

972
00:34:24,372 --> 00:34:25,753
- NO.

973
00:34:25,753 --> 00:34:28,031
- A BIG MAC?
- NO.

974
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:30,999
I'’LL POOP EVERYWHERE
IF I GIVE BIRTH.

975
00:34:30,999 --> 00:34:32,691
- COME ON, YOU HAVE TO EAT
SOMETHING; WHAT DO YOU WANT?

976
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:33,692
- OKAY, I'’LL HAVE
GRILLED CHEESE.

977
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:35,107
- YOU'’LL HAVE GRILLED CHEESE?

978
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:37,109
- JANIS IS ASKING A MILLION
QUESTIONS, AND AS OF RIGHT NOW,

979
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:39,318
IT'’S SO HARD
FOR ME TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.

980
00:34:39,318 --> 00:34:42,321
I'’M JUST TRYING TO DEAL
WITH THE PAIN, AND I JUST--

981
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:45,566
I DON'’T WANT TO FEEL THIS WAY
ANYMORE BECAUSE IT HURTS SO BAD.

982
00:34:46,843 --> 00:34:48,983
[sneezing]

983
00:34:48,983 --> 00:34:50,260
I JUST PEED.

984
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,504
DAMN IT.

985
00:34:52,504 --> 00:34:54,161
- SO WHAT'’S THE PLAN?

986
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:56,473
- I'’LL JUST WAIT TILL MY WATER
BREAKS, OR I'’LL JUST DIE IN BED.

987
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:57,750
[laughter]

988
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,062
- ALL RIGHT, CALM DOWN.

989
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:00,788
- WE COULD DELIVER THE BABY
IN BED.

990
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:03,549
- NO, I DON'’T WANT TO FEEL IT.
- OH.

991
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:04,826
- THAT'’S WHAT SHE'’S SCARED MOST

992
00:35:04,826 --> 00:35:06,345
IS NOT BEING ABLE
TO HAVE THE EPIDURAL.

993
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:07,415
- YEAH.

994
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:08,761
I'’M DEFINITELY NERVOUS
RIGHT NOW,

995
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:10,108
BECAUSE EVERYONE'’S TELLING ME

996
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,006
THAT THE SECOND ONE
COMES SO MUCH QUICKER

997
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:14,388
AND YOU WON'’T HAVE TIME
FOR THE EPIDURAL.

998
00:35:14,388 --> 00:35:17,253
SO OBVIOUSLY,
I'’M FREAKING OUT ABOUT THAT.

999
00:35:17,253 --> 00:35:18,737
I GOT TO GO THE BATHROOM.
- GO AHEAD.

1000
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:21,981
- DON'’T TALK [bleep] ABOUT ME.

1001
00:35:21,981 --> 00:35:24,501
I KNOW I'’M CRAZY.
JUST DEAL WITH IT RIGHT NOW.

1002
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:27,815
THESE CONTRACTIONS ARE LITERALLY
TAKING MY BREATH AWAY,

1003
00:35:27,815 --> 00:35:29,782
AND ANYWHERE THAT I'’M SITTING,
IF I'’M SITTING,

1004
00:35:29,782 --> 00:35:32,923
IF I'’M LAYING DOWN,
IF I'’M WALKING, IT JUST--

1005
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,133
NOTHING HELPS THE PAIN.

1006
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,996
SO HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DEAL
WITH THIS PAIN FOR--

1007
00:35:36,996 --> 00:35:39,620
EVERY TEN MINUTES FOR FOUR DAYS?

1008
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:43,451
IT'’S VERY IRRITATING.
- EXPLAIN THE PAIN.

1009
00:35:43,451 --> 00:35:45,557
LET ME HEAR WHAT IT FEELS LIKE,
WHAT YOU'’RE FEELING.

1010
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:47,006
- LIKE A KNIFE.

1011
00:35:47,006 --> 00:35:50,769
BUT IT'’S LIKE A ROLLER COASTER,
AND THEN IT GOES--

1012
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:52,150
IT GOES, LIKE, FARTS.

1013
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,772
- SHE'’S THE WRONG PERSON
TO TALK TO.

1014
00:35:53,772 --> 00:35:55,774
- I KNOW, '’CAUSE SHE LIKES PAIN.

1015
00:35:55,774 --> 00:35:57,465
IF JIONNI PINCHES ME, I CRY.

1016
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:59,053
I JUST CAN'’T DEAL WITH PAIN.

1017
00:35:59,053 --> 00:36:01,745
SO AS OF RIGHT NOW, I'’M DYING.

1018
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:03,954
OW. SEE, THAT HURTS.

1019
00:36:03,954 --> 00:36:05,439
IT GOES UP,

1020
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:08,269
AND THEN OUCHY, OUCHY, OUCHY,
OUCHY, OUCHY, OUCHY, AND THEN--

1021
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:10,064
- THAT'’S A CONTRACTION.

1022
00:36:10,064 --> 00:36:11,341
- I KNOW.

1023
00:36:11,341 --> 00:36:13,585
IT'’S LIKE A ROLLER COASTER RIDE
OF PAIN.

1024
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:17,761
- I NEED A PILL FOR MY NERVES.
- HAVE A DRINK.

1025
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:19,211
- COME ON,
GIVE ME A KISS GOOD NIGHT.

1026
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:20,350
- WE'’LL CALL YOU
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS.

1027
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,834
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

1028
00:36:21,834 --> 00:36:25,631
- IF I DON'’T HEAR, WAKE ME UP.
- I DON'’T WANT TO COME.

1029
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:28,324
- YOU REALLY THINK
I'’M NOT GONNA GO TONIGHT?

1030
00:36:28,324 --> 00:36:30,118
THAT'’LL SUCK.
- BABE, I DON'’T KNOW.

1031
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:32,880
- I'’M JUST PRAYING
THAT I HAVE THIS BABY TONIGHT,

1032
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,296
BECAUSE I'’VE BEEN
FEELING CONTRACTIONS ALL DAY,

1033
00:36:35,296 --> 00:36:36,746
10 TO 12 MINUTES APART,

1034
00:36:36,746 --> 00:36:38,610
AND NOW BEFORE GOING TO BED,

1035
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,784
THEY'’RE 7 MINUTES APART,
SO I MEAN,

1036
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:42,096
ONCE THEY'’RE 5 MINUTES APART,

1037
00:36:42,096 --> 00:36:43,442
THAT'’S TIME
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL,

1038
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:45,203
AND IT'’S TIME
TO PUSH THE BABY OUT.

1039
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,790
SO IT'’S GOT TO BE TONIGHT.

1040
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,033
GOOD NIGHT.

1041
00:36:48,033 --> 00:36:51,209
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

1042
00:36:52,624 --> 00:36:54,142
- OW.

1043
00:36:54,142 --> 00:36:56,144
I FEEL REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE
RIGHT NOW.

1044
00:36:56,144 --> 00:36:57,594
BABE?
- HMM.

1045
00:36:57,594 --> 00:36:59,217
- FEELS LIKE IT'’S COMING
OUT OF MY BUTTHOLE.

1046
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,494
I WANT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

1047
00:37:00,494 --> 00:37:01,874
- RIGHT NOW? FOR REAL?

1048
00:37:01,874 --> 00:37:03,635
- YES.

1049
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:04,843
IT HURTS.

1050
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:06,396
I CAN'’T SLEEP AT ALL.

1051
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:08,122
WAIT. I'’M CRAMPING.

1052
00:37:08,122 --> 00:37:10,020
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE YOUR TIME.
- OW.

1053
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,126
AND I'’M TIMING MY CONTRACTIONS,

1054
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:13,990
AND THEY'’RE FIVE,
SIX MINUTES APART.

1055
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:16,199
AND THEY FEEL LIKE DEATH.

1056
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:19,340
I FEEL LIKE THERE'’S A KNIFE
IN MY UTERUS TWISTING

1057
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,962
AND IN MY VAGINA,

1058
00:37:20,962 --> 00:37:24,966
AND THIS PAIN, I'’VE NEVER FELT
THIS PAIN IN MY LIFE.

1059
00:37:24,966 --> 00:37:26,520
I CAN'’T BREATHE.

1060
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,900
I CAN'’T MOVE.

1061
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,144
AND THIS PAIN IS NOT GOING AWAY.

1062
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:32,250
SO I FEEL LIKE THIS
IS THE REAL DEAL.

1063
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,184
I'’M IN LABOR, AND I NEED TO BE
AT THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW.

1064
00:37:36,184 --> 00:37:38,601
IT HURTS.
BABE, IT REALLY HURTS.

1065
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:39,843
- COME ON.
TAKE IT EASY.

1066
00:37:39,843 --> 00:37:44,917
- OH, I CAN'’T DO IT.
OUCH.

1067
00:37:44,917 --> 00:37:46,298
BABE, I DON'’T THINK
I CAN GET UP THE STAIRS.

1068
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:48,611
- GO SLOW.
- I DON'’T WANT TO. OW.

1069
00:37:48,611 --> 00:37:51,027
- AS SOON AS WE GET THERE,
YOU GET YOUR--YOUR MEDS.

1070
00:37:51,027 --> 00:37:53,719
- I'’M SCARED [bleep].

1071
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:55,894
I'’M NERVOUS. I'’M TERRIFIED.

1072
00:37:55,894 --> 00:37:57,689
I JUST--I'’M NOT GOOD WITH PAIN,

1073
00:37:57,689 --> 00:38:00,485
AND I JUST REALLY, REALLY
WANT TO GET THE EPIDURAL

1074
00:38:00,485 --> 00:38:01,900
SO I DON'’T FEEL ANYTHING.

1075
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,247
SO THAT'’S JUST IN THE BACK
OF MY MIND RIGHT NOW

1076
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:08,596
IS TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL
ON TIME TO GET THE EPIDURAL.

1077
00:38:08,596 --> 00:38:12,497
BECAUSE IF I DON'’T GET
THE EPIDURAL, I'’M DYING.

1078
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:17,571
OW.
- TAKE IT EASY.

1079
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:19,814
- BABE, I CAN'’T EVEN SIT.
- WELL, TAKE IT EASY.

1080
00:38:19,814 --> 00:38:21,091
JUST RELAX.
- NO, IT HURTS.

1081
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:22,403
YOU DON'’T GET IT.
- WE'’RE ALMOST THERE.

1082
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:24,716
WE'’RE ALMOST THERE.

1083
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:26,821
- NO.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1084
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:28,029
BABE, BABE.

1085
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:30,722
- JIONNI, I CAN'’T.

1086
00:38:30,722 --> 00:38:32,171
- NICOLE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1087
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:34,450
- THIS IS THE ONLY COMFORTABLE
POSITION I CAN DO RIGHT NOW.

1088
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:37,211
- JUST CALM DOWN.
- THIS IS YOUR FAULT.

1089
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:39,420
I NEED THE EPIDURAL,
LIKE, RIGHT NOW.

1090
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,043
- WE'’RE ALMOST THERE.
- NO, I CAN'’T DO THIS.

1091
00:38:42,043 --> 00:38:43,528
- JUST BREATHE.
WE'’RE--YOU'’RE OKAY.

1092
00:38:43,528 --> 00:38:45,046
- I CAN'’T BREATHE.

1093
00:38:45,046 --> 00:38:47,911
I'’M NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN.
- BABE, WE'’RE PULLING IN.

1094
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:49,119
WE'’RE PULLING IN.

1095
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,742
- I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

1096
00:38:50,742 --> 00:38:51,674
OH.

1097
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,679
YOU GOT MY PILLOW?

1098
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,581
AH!

1099
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:03,927
AH!
- COME ON.

1100
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:05,791
- NO.

1101
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:09,208
NO. AH. OW!

1102
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:10,382
I CAN'’T MOVE.
- ALL RIGHT.

1103
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:11,659
- I CAN'’T MOVE.
- IT'’S ALMOST OVER.

1104
00:39:11,659 --> 00:39:14,317
- I CAN'’T MOVE.
I CAN'’T MOVE.

1105
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:17,182
- ALL RIGHT, JUST SIT.

1106
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:18,666
I'’LL TAKE YOU FROM HERE.

1107
00:39:24,603 --> 00:39:26,916
- I'’M LITERALLY CRYING,
I'’M IN SO MUCH PAIN.

1108
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,504
I JUST--I CAN'’T MOVE.

1109
00:39:28,504 --> 00:39:31,299
I CAN'’T EVEN SIT RIGHT
IN THE CHAIR RIGHT NOW,

1110
00:39:31,299 --> 00:39:33,750
AND MY VAGINA REALLY HURTS,
AND MY UTERUS REALLY HURTS,

1111
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:35,131
AND EVERYTHING REALLY HURTS,

1112
00:39:35,131 --> 00:39:36,477
AND THIS IS HELL.

1113
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:38,479
OH, I CAN'’T DO IT.

1114
00:39:38,479 --> 00:39:39,894
HONESTLY, I JUST WANT
MY MOMMY.

1115
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:41,240
OW.

1116
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,587

- AH!

1118
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:48,455
I FEEL HER HEAD
COMING DOWN MY VAGINA,

1119
00:39:48,455 --> 00:39:52,113
AND SHE'’S JUST GONNA POP OUT.

1120
00:39:52,113 --> 00:39:55,013
[crying]

1121
00:40:04,332 --> 00:40:06,231
OW, OW, OW.

I'’M JUST PREPARING MYSELF,
YOU KNOW,

1125
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:17,207
GOD FORBID THE EPIDURAL
DOESN'’T KICK IN IN TIME.

1126
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:20,556
I SERIOUSLY NEED TO GET
MENTALLY FOCUSED

1127
00:40:20,556 --> 00:40:23,731
TO ACTUALLY GIVE BIRTH
AND FEEL EVERYTHING.

1128
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:26,907
AND I'’M SCARED THAT I'’M NOT
GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THIS.

1129
00:40:26,907 --> 00:40:31,290
[moaning]

1130
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,637

AH! NO. NO.
[sobbing]

1133
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:40,645
- YOU'’RE DOING GREAT.
IT'’S GONNA BE CLOSE.

1134
00:40:40,645 --> 00:40:42,267
- WHOA, WHOA, PLEASE HELP ME.

1135
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:44,200
SOMETHING'’S NOT RIGHT.

1136
00:40:47,755 --> 00:40:48,963
- NEXT TIME ON SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW...

1137
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:50,413

[baby cries]

1140
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:53,416

- I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.

1144
00:41:00,768 --> 00:41:04,082
- AFTER 27 YEARS, THIS IS
THE DAY I ACTUALLY MOVE OUT.

1145
00:41:04,082 --> 00:41:05,255
ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO.

1146
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,464
- GET MARRIED.
