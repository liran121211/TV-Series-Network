- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
ANTI-DIARRHEA?

134
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,067
- YOU'RE GONNA
SAY "ANTI-DIARRHEA"

135
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,467
SO THEY KNOW
WE HAVE DIARRHEA?

139
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,867
AND GO THROUGH
THE SAME PROBLEM,

140
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:57,867
SO DON'T JUDGE.

141
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:00,733
- SAY "STOMACH PROBLEMS."

142
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,367
- THEN THEY MIGHT GIVE YOU
SOMETHING ELSE.

143
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:06,067
- ALL RIGHT, SAY, "PISS
DIARRHEA OUT OF MY ASS," THEN.

- OH, WE DON'T DELIVER

151
00:05:19,367 --> 00:05:20,867
- CLEARLY,
IF YOU HAVE DIARRHEA,

152
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,267
YOU DON'T WANT TO WALK TOO FAR
AWAY FROM THE BATHROOM.

153
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,500
I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO THE STORE.

154
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,067
THAT MEANS I'VE GOT TO GO
ALL THE WAY DOWN,

155
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,300
ALL THE WAY UP.

156
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,567
SOMETHING COULD HAPPEN
IN BETWEEN

157
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,067
THAT WE DON'T WANT.

158
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,400
- I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD PUT
SOME UNDERWEARS ON.

159
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:31,867
- YOU NEED A DIAPER.

160
00:05:31,933 --> 00:05:33,333
YOU AREN'T EVEN
WEARING A DIAPER?

161
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,767
- NO. DO I HAVE, LIKE,
A BROWN STAIN ON MY ASS?

162
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,100
DO I?
- NO.

163
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,167
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH.

164
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:42,233
- YOU NEVER KNOW.
- HAVE YOU EVER "SHARTED"?

165
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,167
- YEAH.
- [laughs]

166
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,267
- YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I'VE BEEN HUNG OVER?

167
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:47,067
I'M LIKE,
"UH, I GOTTA FART,"

168
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,567
AND THEN IT'S JUST
DRIBBLING DOWN MY LEG.

169
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:52,467
LIKE, COME ON.
- [laughs]

170
00:05:52,533 --> 00:05:54,567
THANK GOD NICOLE DOES NOT HAVE
A BROWN STAIN ON HER PANTS.

171
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:57,433
I DON'T EVER SUGGEST WEARING
WHITE WHEN YOU HAVE PROBLEMS

172
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,300
IN THAT AREA.

173
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,833
IT LOOKS VERY TROPICAL.
- YEAH.

174
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,400
I'VE NEVER FELT THIS BAD
IN MY LIFE.

175
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:12,067
LIKE, MY BODY
JUST IS SO WEAK.

176
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,067
[...], I FEEL LIKE
WE SHOULD MAKE DRINKS,

177
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,533
GET A LITTLE BUZZ ON,

178
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,200
AND MAYBE HAVING
A MARGARITA

179
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:18,400
WILL MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

180
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:19,700
- WELCOME TO
MARGARITAVILLE.

181
00:06:19,767 --> 00:06:21,100
both: HI.
- ALL RIGHT.

182
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,233
YOU NEED A FEW MINUTES
TO DECIDE ON DRINKS,

183
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,367
FIGURE IT OUT?

184
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:24,633
- WELL, I WOULD LIKE

185
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,967
TWO EMPTY SHOT GLASSES.

186
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:28,300
- TWO EMPTY SHOT GLASSES?
- YEAH.

187
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,733
- YOU GOT IT.

188
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,067
- WE HAVE STOMACH PROBLEMS
TODAY.

189
00:06:31,133 --> 00:06:32,967
- OKAY.
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

190
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:35,700
- EVERYONE HAS DIARRHEA
ONCE IN THEIR LIFE.

191
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:38,333
- YEAH.
- WE'RE ONLY HUMAN.

192
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,900
- HIT ME HIGH.
- ALL THE WAY?

193
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,067
- AS MUCH AS YOU'RE DOING.

194
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,433
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH WE TAKE.

195
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,100
LIKE A FULL CUP?
- NO!

196
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:48,500
- OH. LIKE, HALFWAY.
- THAT'S [...] UP.

197
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,133
THAT'S FINE.
- CHEERS.

198
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,333
THREE YEARS AGO, WE WOULD BE
TAKING SHOTS ON THE TABLE,

199
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,300
ANNOYING CUSTOMERS,

200
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:59,067
AND NOW WE'RE TAKING
SHOTS OF MEDICINE.

201
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:01,133
I MEAN, WE'RE LIKE
OLD PEOPLE NOW.

202
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,400
I USED TO DRINK
AND BE FINE.

203
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:04,600
- YOU NEVER DRANK
AND WERE FINE.

204
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,433
YOU SLEPT TILL 5:00
IN THE AFTERNOON EVERY DAY.

205
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,867
- WHOO!

206
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,367
- MOM?

207
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,167
- YEAH?
HI, JI, HOW ARE YA?

208
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,133
- I'M GOING PAINTBALLING
WITH ROGER.

209
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,833
CAN YOU BABYSIT?

210
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,600
ROGER AND I WANT TO
GO PAINTBALLING TOMORROW.

211
00:07:20,667 --> 00:07:22,600
IF I DO GET IN TROUBLE,
AT LEAST I COULD SAY

212
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:24,167
I CALLED MY MOTHER
TO COME BABYSIT.

213
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:25,733
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL GET DOWN
THERE, UM--

214
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,200
I'LL GET DOWN THERE
SOMETIME IN THE AFTERNOON.

215
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:31,267
- WELL, I GUESS WE'RE GOING
PAINTBALLING.

216
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,800
[laughs]

217
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:38,767
- YAY!

218
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,833
WHO KNEW THAT HAVING
A MARGARITA

219
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,067
WOULD MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

220
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:44,233
DO YOU HAVE THE KEY?
- YES.

221
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,833
- SO, TONIGHT WE'RE GOING
TO A GAY CLUB,

222
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,600
AND GAY CLUBS ARE SO MUCH BETTER
THAN REGULAR CLUBS.

223
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:51,100
- SERIOUSLY. WE JUST WANT TO
HAVE GIRLS NIGHT.

224
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,967
NO GUYS THAT ARE GONNA, LIKE,
YOU KNOW,

225
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,333
TRY AND BE ALL UP ON THIS.

226
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,333
- YEAH.

227
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,733
both: WE'RE TAKEN.

228
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,067
- [laughs]

229
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,467
[applauds]

230
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:02,867
- MY LIFE IS COMPLETE!

231
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,567
I WANT MY JOEY.

232
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,067
I FEEL LIKE
I'M CHEATING ON HIM.

233
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,967
- IT'S QUIET.

234
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,467
SO, RIGHT WHEN WE
GET TO THE CLUB,

235
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:10,567
NOBODY'S THERE.

236
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:12,267
I'M LIKE, COOL.

237
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,767
BUT THEN AGAIN, I JUST WANT TO
HAVE A FUN TIME WITH BOO-BOO,

238
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,267
SO, EVEN THOUGH IT'S DEAD,

239
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,233
IT'S ACTUALLY
LIKE A GOOD THING.

240
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,667
- GIRLS!

241
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,233
- HI.
- HOLA.

242
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,200
- HOW ARE YOU?
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

243
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,600
- I'M BRITNEY.
- I'M ROBYN.

244
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:26,900
- THIS IS ROBYN.

245
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,800
WE'RE A MOTHER
AND DAUGHTER TEAM.

246
00:08:28,867 --> 00:08:31,100
- I LIKE YOUR BOOBIES.
- YEAH!

247
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:33,367
- SO, TWO DRAG QUEENS
COME UP TO US

248
00:08:33,433 --> 00:08:35,667
THAT LOOK LIKE ROGER
AND JIONNI

249
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:36,900
IN MAKEUP AND WIGS.

250
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,133
I MEAN, LET'S BE REAL.

251
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,233
- CHEERS, JERSEY GIRLS
IN THE HOUSE!

252
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,833
- CHEERS, BITCHES!
- WORK.

253
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,067
- THE QUEENS ARE TRYING TO
GET US INTOXICATED.

254
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,833
- SERIOUSLY.
BLEHH.

255
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,367
- YOU LOOK HOT AS A BLONDE.
- AH!

256
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,700
- ME AND JENNI ARE HAVING
A BLAST RIGHT NOW.

257
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,900
WE'RE DANCING,
WE'RE ORDERING SHOTS.

258
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:00,233
- GETTING OUR GROOVE ON
WITH THE QUEENS.

259
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,433
I'M HAVING A FABULOUS TIME.
- ME TOO.

260
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,300
AAH!
[laughs]

261
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:14,633
- PHOTO SHOOT. READY?
GET IT. WORK IT.

262
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,267
- AAH!

263
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:35,433
- WHEN YOU SEE ME
FALLING ASLEEP AT A CLUB

264
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
WITH MUSIC
POUNDING BEHIND ME,

265
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:38,833
IT'S TIME TO GO.

266
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,533
BRRR.

267
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,800
NICOLE'S FINE.

268
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:46,267
SHE NEEDS THIS.
SHE'S A MOM.

269
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:52,567
IT'S MY NEW ACCESSORY.

270
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,967
IT'S WET.
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

271
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,967
[club music playing]

272
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:01,400

273
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:15,433
THERE'S A LOT OF ALCOHOL
IN MY SYSTEM RIGHT NOW.

274
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,467
I WISH I COULD GET
THIS SANGRIA,

275
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,867
JUNGLE JUICE
OUT OF MY STOMACH.

276
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,400
- RRARR!
- HI!

277
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,967
- ARE YOU SLEEPIES?
- I SAVED YOU A SPOT.

278
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:28,500
- THANKS, BUD.
- LOOK! LOOK!

279
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,267

00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:33,800
- [laughs]

281
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,233
- THIS IS WHAT I PICTURED
OUR GIRLS' NIGHT TO BE.

282
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,067
GET AWAY!
- DID YOU HAVE FUN?

283
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:40,100

[seagulls crying]

289
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,100
- I HAD SO MUCH FUN
LAST NIGHT.

290
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:58,567
I DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER MUCH,

291
00:10:58,633 --> 00:11:00,633
BUT I JUST REMEMBER DANCING
AND CATWALKING.

292
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,567
I WOKE UP
WITH DIRTY FEET.

293
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:03,800
- MY BUTT HURTS.

294
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:06,533
MY BUTT IS VERY--
WHAT IS IT?

295
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,567
RARE? RAWR? SORE?

296
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:12,100
[laughs]

297
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,167
[sighs]

298
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:14,867
LIFE IS SO HARD.

299
00:11:14,933 --> 00:11:16,633
- IT REALLY IS.

300
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,400
- HELLO?

301
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,333
OH, GOD.

302
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,900
YOU'RE REALLY CARRYING THIS
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

303
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:25,700
- I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO WIN.

304
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,533
THIS IS LIKE THE HUNGER GAMES
WITH ME AND ROGER.

305
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,367
I'M--I'M SURVIVING.
I NEED TO LOOK INTIMIDATING.

306
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,833
IF ROGER SEES ME, HE'S GONNA BE
SCARED RIGHT NOW.

307
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,967
HE'S GONNA BE PETRIFIED.

308
00:11:38,467 --> 00:11:41,200
- [laughs]

309
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,533
IS THAT A KNIFE?
YOU GOT A NECK KNIFE?

310
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,300
WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?
- JUST IN CASE.

311
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:47,700
THEY CALL ME
JOHN [...] RAMBO, OKAY?

312
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:50,067
I HUNT GUYS LIKE YOU.

313
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,200

00:11:52,267 --> 00:11:54,567
GOT YOU IN THERE.

315
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:56,233
I'M GONNA SHOOT
THE [...] OUT OF YOU.

316
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,833
NUT SHOTS ALL DAY.

317
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:05,067
- BUST? OH, COME ON.
- I'LL HOLD.

318
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:07,133
- HI, DO YOU MIND
IF I JOIN YOU?

319
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,700
- SURE.

320
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:11,900
SORRY IF WE SMELL.
WE'RE HUNG OVER.

321
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:13,467
AS THE DAY PROGRESSES,

322
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,700
I FEEL LIKE MY HANGOVER
JUST GETS WORSE AND WORSE.

323
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:16,933
- LIKE, WHY IS THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW WHY.

324
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:18,167
I DON'T KNOW.

325
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,233
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO
THE OPPOSITE WAY.

326
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,967
- I KNOW.
- OH! GOT A BLACKJACK.

327
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:23,667
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

328
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,467
- AW, IS THAT YOUR HUSBAND?
- OH, IS THAT YOUR HUSBAND?

329
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:26,733
- YES.

330
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,600
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN TOGETHER?

331
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:28,967
- 21 YEARS.
- AW!

332
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:31,833
- SEE? IT HAPPENS.
DO YOU STILL HAVE SEX?

333
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,600
- IT GETS BETTER--
OF COURSE WE DO.

334
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:34,900
IT GETS BETTER
AS YOU GET OLDER.

335
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:36,067
- THEY STILL HAVE SEX.
- REALLY?

336
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,867
- GOOD FOR YOU.
AMAZING.

337
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:39,633
THEY STILL HAVE SEX.
- BETTER SEX.

338
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,067
- AND I THINK--I THINK
THAT'S FABULOUS.

339
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,700
AND IT'S PROBABLY
WRINKLY.

340
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,300
- DON'T EVEN GO THERE
WITH WRINKLES.

341
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,967
- OH!
- [groans]

342
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,333
- SHE'S SCARED
TO GET MARRIED,

343
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,667
'CAUSE SHE THINKS
SHE'S GONNA GET DIVORCED.

344
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:52,867
- WELL, WE DRIVE EACH OTHER
[...] NUTS.

345
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:54,400
- WELL, THAT'S THE WAY
IT SHOULD BE.

346
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:55,800
- RIGHT? IF IT DIDN'T--

347
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,800
IF IT WASN'T LIKE THAT,
THAT'D BE WEIRD.

348
00:12:57,867 --> 00:12:59,400
- THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
- THAT'S HOW I TAKE IT.

349
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:00,933
- SEE?
- YOU'D BE BORED.

350
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,333
IF YOU DON'T FIGHT,
THAT MEANS YOU DON'T CARE.

351
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

352
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:04,533
FIGHTING IS A GOOD THING,

353
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,533
'CAUSE THAT MEANS
YOU'RE IN LOVE

354
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,833
AND YOU'RE VERY PASSIONATE.

355
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:07,933
- YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.
- THANK YOU.

356
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:09,567
- ENJOY IT
AND FIGHT LIKE HELL!

357
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:11,400
- IF YOU DON'T FIGHT,
YOU DON'T CARE.

358
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:12,767
- EXACTLY.

359
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,333
- SO, ME AND ROGER
MUST REALLY BE IN LOVE.

360
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,133
- MM-HMM.

361
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,667
GO HARD OR GO HOME.

362
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:21,533
WE WENT HARD LAST NIGHT,
NOW WE GOTTA GO HOME,

363
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,533
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE [...].

364
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,233
- HOW ARE YA?
- WHAT'S UP, FELLAS?

365
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,267
- BIG TARGET.
- YEAH. LITTLE TARGET.

366
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,900
- YEAH, YOU CAN USE THAT
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE!

367
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,100
- WHAT'S THE ADVANTAGE?

368
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:32,567
- I FEEL LIKE IT'S
ALMOST LIKE GOLF.

369
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:34,167
I SHOULD HAVE A HANDICAP,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

370
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:35,433
'CAUSE I'M SHOOTING
AT, LIKE,

371
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,967
A COMPRESSED,
LITTLE SIZE OF A MAN.

372
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,500
ALL RIGHT,
YOU READY, BITCH?

373
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:42,633
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.
- I'M GONNA [...] YOUR ASS UP.

374
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,967
- IT'S LIKE PLAYING PAINTBALL
WITH A GARDEN GNOME.

375
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:48,433
- 3, 2, 1, GO!
- LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

376
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,767
COME ON!

377
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,867
[paintball gunfire]

378
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,467
- WHERE ARE YOU, ROGER?

379
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,400
I'M JUMPING, I'M DIVING,
I'M HIDING, I'M FLIPPING.

380
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,067
I AM JOHN RAMBO.

381
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,733
[paintball gunfire]
- COME ON, BITCH!

382
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,067
YOU CAN'T HIDE ALL DAY!

383
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:02,500
WE'RE IN THE HEAT
OF BATTLE.

384
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,100
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK,
THERE'S PAINTBALLS,

385
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,733
THERE'S SMOKE GRENADES
GOING OFF.

386
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,367
IT'S JUST CARNAGE
RIGHT NOW, MAYHEM.

387
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:09,200
- EAT [...]!

388
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,600
- YOU GOTTA ADVANCE,
BITCH!

389
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:11,867
YOU JUST CAN'T HIDE THERE
ALL DAY!

390
00:14:11,933 --> 00:14:14,267
[paintball gunfire]

391
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,933
- KILL! YEAH!

392
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,233
YEAH!
- [laughs]

393
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,833
- GOING DOWN.
- "GOING DOWN."

394
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,767
SHE SOUNDS SO DEPRESSED.

395
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,533
THANK YOU, SIR.
- YOU'RE SO KIND.

396
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,367
CHIVALRY ISN'T DEAD.

397
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:35,433
- I JUST HAD AN AMAZING TIME
WITH MY BOO.

398
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,067
- GOOD TIMES.

399
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,300
I HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM ROGER.

400
00:14:39,367 --> 00:14:41,867
I HOPE HE'S HAVING FUN.

401
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:43,400
[overlapping shouts]

402
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,567
[paintball gunfire]
- [shouting]

403
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:49,667
- NO? DON'T LIKE IT?
- HEE-EH.

404
00:14:49,733 --> 00:14:53,700
- I'M SO TIRED.
I'M GONNA CALL JIONNI.

405
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,067
[paintball gunfire]

406
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,767
- HEY, ROG, TIME! TIME!

407
00:14:56,833 --> 00:15:00,267
HELLO.
- HI, BABE.

408
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,633
WE'RE 25 MINUTES AWAY.
- OH, ARE YA? ALL RIGHT.

409
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,433
WE'RE DOING GOOD.
- ARE YOU WITH ROGER?

410
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,267
- YEAH, WE'VE BEEN
TOGETHER ALL DAY.

411
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,767
- WHERE ARE YOU?

412
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:11,900
- WE'RE JUST CHILLING
AT THE HOUSE.

413
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:13,600
- COULD I SAY HI
TO LORENZO?

414
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:17,067
- OH, HE'S, UH,
KIND OF FUSSY RIGHT NOW.

415
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,067
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

416
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:20,333
YOU GUYS SOUND TOO NICE
RIGHT NOW.

417
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,767
- YEAH, SERIOUSLY.

418
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:23,233
- BABE--BABE,
HE'S GETTING FUSSY.

419
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,867
HOLD--HOLD ON.

420
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,067
- OH.
- AW.

421
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:30,767
- LORENZO, I MISS YOU.

422
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,367
- I GAVE HER THE RECORDING
AND SHE FELL FOR IT.

423
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:33,767
- SHE DID FALL FOR IT.
- IT WORKED.

424
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,667
- IT DID WORK.
- COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU.

425
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:37,733
- PAH-POW!

426
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,667
[both laugh]

427
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,400
WELL, WE GOTTA GET
OUT OF HERE, MAN. COME ON.

428
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:43,233
- LET'S GO.
THE GIRLS ARE ON THEIR WAY.

429
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,067
I THINK WE COULD MAKE IT BACK
BEFORE THEY GET THERE.

430
00:15:45,133 --> 00:15:46,167
- DON'T DOUBT
MY DRIVING SKILLS, SON.

431
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,433
- YEAH, WE COULD DO IT.

432
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,467
I MEAN, WE'RE GONNA
PULL THIS OFF.

433
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,067
- OH, YEAH.

434
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,233
LET'S GO, LET'S GO,
LET'S GO!

435
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,467
WE GOTTA GO, WE GOTTA GO,
WE GOTTA GO, PEOPLE!

436
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:58,367
- I JUST WANT TO KISS
JIONNI.

437
00:15:58,433 --> 00:15:59,867
- AW.

438
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,767
- YOU HAVE TO GET THERE
BEFORE THEM.

439
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:04,167
WE ARE "FUNK."
- [laughs]

440
00:16:04,233 --> 00:16:05,300
- WE'RE ALMOST HOME.

441
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:07,767
- ALREADY?
- YEAH.

442
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,533
- COME ON!
- GO, BABY, GO!

443
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,433
- LOOK AT THIS TRAFFIC, MAN.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

444
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,633
- WE'RE GONNA BE DIVORCED
BEFORE WE GET MARRIED.

445
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:20,433
- THERE'S MORE
SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW ON THE WAY...

446
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,533
- AND IT CONTINUES NOW.

447
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:25,600
- SO, HOW MUCH TROUBLE
YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA BE IN

448
00:16:25,667 --> 00:16:26,567
WHEN WE GET BACK HERE?

449
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:27,900
- IF WE MAKE IT ON TIME,

450
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:28,900
WE COULD--WE COULD WEASEL
OUR WAY OUT.

451
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:29,900
- I KNOW.

452
00:16:29,967 --> 00:16:30,900
- BUT IF WE PULL UP

453
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,533
AND THEY'RE SITTING THERE,

454
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,667
I DON'T KNOW.

455
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,433
WHAT DO WE--
WHAT DO I SAY?

456
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,667
- DOES EVERY LIVING CREATURE
HAVE A BUTT HOLE?

457
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,600
- I FEEL LIKE, YEAH.

458
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,133
EXCEPT FOR, LIKE,
ORGANISMS, MAYBE.

459
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,533
[belches]

460
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,067
- I KNOW THIS BACK ROAD
RIGHT HERE.

461
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,333
THIS'LL CUT OFF
A LITTLE TIME.

462
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,600
- ROGER LIVES
AROUND HERE.

463
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:49,867
LET--LET--LET'S TAKE
SOME SHORTCUTS.

464
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:51,200
LET'S BEAT THESE GIRLS HOME.

465
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:53,900
- DO FROGS HAVE BUTT HOLES?

466
00:16:53,967 --> 00:16:57,067
- GOTTA GET RID OF THE WASTE
SOMEHOW, RIGHT?

467
00:16:57,133 --> 00:16:58,700
- I DON'T KNOW, BRO.
- I MEAN, I THOUGHT--

468
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,133
- I THINK I'M GOOD.

469
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,300
I DON'T THINK JENNI'S
GONNA GET TOO MAD.

470
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,100
- LIKE, I THREW OUT
[...] IN THE BAG.

471
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,067
I WAS--I WAS PLAYING
THE BABY CRYING.

472
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:06,733
I-I-I HAD THIS
ALL PLANNED OUT.

473
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,967
- WE STILL GOT A SHOT
AT BEATING THEM, SO...

474
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:10,967
- LORENZO'S BUTT HOLE
IS CUTE.

475
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:13,900
IT'S LIKE A...
- BALLOON?

476
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,400
- YEAH. BUT IT'S,
LIKE, LITTLE.

477
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:19,300
- AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
JANIS IS THERE?

478
00:17:19,367 --> 00:17:21,633
- SHE HAS NO IDEA.

479
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,233
- HONEY, WE'RE HOME.
- BABE?

480
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,733
- SURPRISE.
- [gasps]

481
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,333
SO, RIGHT WHEN I WALK
INTO THE HOUSE,

482
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,733
I SEE JANIS
HOLDING LORENZO,

483
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,267
AND I'M LIKE,
"WHERE'S JIONNI?"

484
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,133
WHERE'D THEY GO?
- [gasps]

485
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,567
TO PLAY.
- TO PLAY WHAT?

486
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:37,567
OH, YOU BROUGHT FOOD.
- WHAT'D THEY DO?

487
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,767
- WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT?
PIT BULL? PAINT--PAINTBALL.

488
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,567
- I WAS REALLY, REALLY EXCITED
TO SEE JIONNI,

489
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,067
AND THE FACT
THAT HE'S NOT HERE,

490
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:46,633
AND HIM AND ROGER ARE OUT
DOING BOY THINGS, I MEAN,

491
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,200
I'M ANNOYED.

492
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,133
I JUST WISH HE WOULD HAVE
TOLD ME.

493
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,100
- I DON'T THINK HE REALLY
WANTED TO GO, JIONNI.

494
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,300
- NO?
JIONNI LOVES THAT STUFF.

495
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:56,100
- YEAH.

496
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,233
- JANIS IS TRYING TO SAVE
HER SON RIGHT NOW.

497
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,633
- I JUST WISH HE TOLD ME.

498
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,567
- WHOSE BABY WAS CRYING
IN THE BACKGROUND?

499
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:01,933
- IT WAS PROBABLY ROGER,
GOING...

500
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,300
- IT WAS PROBABLY
YOUR HUSBAND, PROBABLY.

501
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:04,767
- YEAH, BUT ROGER
CAN'T HIT THAT HIGH NOTE,

502
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,233
AND YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS LORENZO.

503
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,900
- MAYBE IT WAS A--
- A TAPE?

504
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,833
- A DEER.
AN ANIMAL.

505
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,200
I DON'T KNOW.

506
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:15,467
- IF WE MAKE IT,
THIS IS ONE HELL OF A DAY.

507
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,533
- [laughs]
- IF WE DON'T...

508
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,867
- I'M GONNA [...]
AND SIDESTEP THIS THING

509
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:20,867
INTO YOUR DRIVEWAY.

510
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,100
BUH-BUH-BUH-BUH!

511
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,400
- DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD
HIDE THE CAR?

512
00:18:23,467 --> 00:18:25,533
MOVE IT ON ANOTHER ROAD,

513
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,233
SO THEY DON'T KNOW WE'RE HERE
AND THEN PRANK THEM?

514
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,200
SO, I REALLY WANT TO BUST
THE BOYS WHEN THEY GET HOME

515
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:31,700
BECAUSE THIS IS ANNOYING.

516
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,100
THEY LIED TO US,

517
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:34,433
AND YOU DON'T LIE
TO YOUR FIANCE.

518
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,367
THAT'S JUST ANNOYING.

519
00:18:36,433 --> 00:18:37,900
SO, WE'RE GONNA
GET THEM BACK.

520
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:39,700
ALL RIGHT, I PARKED THE CAR
AROUND THE BLOCK.

521
00:18:39,767 --> 00:18:41,100
- OKAY.

522
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,733
- SO, THEY'RE NOT GONNA
KNOW WE'RE HERE.

523
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,167
IF YOU WANT TO PRANK US,

524
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:46,467
WE'RE GONNA PRANK YOU BACK,
BITCHES. JERKOFFS.

525
00:18:46,533 --> 00:18:48,700
- WHAT IS SHE GONNA SAY IF SHE
SEES MY MOTHER THERE?

526
00:18:48,767 --> 00:18:50,200
- WHAT IS YOUR MOTHER
GONNA SAY?

527
00:18:50,267 --> 00:18:51,767
WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER GONNA
SAY YOU WENT?

528
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,833
- I-I COULD SEE HER
BACKING ME UP,

529
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,467
BUT I'M GETTING NERVOUS.

530
00:18:55,533 --> 00:18:57,067
- I'M NOT EVEN WORRIED
ABOUT IT.

531
00:18:57,133 --> 00:18:58,067
YOU'RE STRESSING ME OUT
'CAUSE YOU'RE STRESSING OUT.

532
00:18:58,067 --> 00:18:59,567
- SHOULD I CALL THE BOYS?

533
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:02,200
BE LIKE, "WE'RE ALMOST HOME.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?"

534
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,300
- SURE.
- TWO CAN PLAY THIS GAME.

535
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:06,933
- OH, [...].
- DID SHE CALL AGAIN?

536
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:09,967
- YEAH.

537
00:19:10,067 --> 00:19:11,900
HELLO.

538
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:14,467
- HI, JIONNI.
- HI.

539
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:18,067
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- NOTHING. JUST HANGING.

540
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,667
- WE'RE GONNA BE HOME
IN, LIKE, 15 MINUTES.

541
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,800
- OKAY. YEAH,
WE'RE JUST HANGING.

542
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:23,233
- CAN I TALK TO LORENZO?

543
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,833
- UM, HE--HE--HE'S--HE'S, UH...
HOLD ON, BABE.

544
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,500
ROGER'S TRYING TO
CHANGE HIM.

545
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:31,933
- ROGER DOES NOT
CHANGE DIAPERS.

546
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,600
- HE SAID--HE SAID, UH,
IN HIS--IN HIS--

547
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:37,833
IN HIS THERAPY, THEY SAID HE
SHOULD START CHANGING DIAPERS.

548
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,900
- OKAY.
JENNI'S MAKING A FACE.

549
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,267
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

550
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:43,933
- IT'LL HELP ME BE
A BETTER FATHER ONE DAY.

551
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,833
- ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL BE HOME SOON.

552
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,600
LOVE YOU. BYE.

554
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,067

00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,600
- ROGER'S CHANGING
THE DIAPER.

556
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,667
- YEAH, AND LORENZO CAN'T COME

557
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:57,167
- OKAY.

THEY'RE AWFUL LIARS.
