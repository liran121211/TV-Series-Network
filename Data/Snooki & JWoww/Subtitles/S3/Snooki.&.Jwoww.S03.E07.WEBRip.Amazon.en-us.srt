WE'RE OFF
TO AN ADOPTION FAIR.

00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:22,263
- IT DOES SOUND WEIRD--

- I'LL RACE YOU, ROGER.
- YOU WANNA RACE?

I'LL RACE YOU.
WHERE WE RACING TO?

MAKES ME REALIZE
THAT ME AND ROGER

YOU'RE MOVING
AT WARP SPEED 9.

24
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,092
WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

WE'RE IN THERAPY, WE'RE LOOKING
INTO ADOPTION CENTERS,

THAT'S MOVING TOO FAST
IN MY BOOK, YOU KNOW?

00:01:06,963 --> 00:01:09,207
- SORRY I BROUGHT IT UP.

29
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:11,416
- DON'T BE SORRY.
EXPRESS HOW YOU FEEL.

30
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:13,245
BUT YOU'LL ALL OVER
YOUR PLACE WITH HOW YOU FEEL.

31
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:14,729
THAT'S WHAT'S CONFUSING ME.

32
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:16,697
I HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT RIGHT NOW

33
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,008
WE ARE NOT
IN THE BEST POSITION...

34
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,217
- BUT IF I GOT PREGNANT NOW,

35
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:20,597
WE HAVE NINE MONTHS.
- TO DO THAT.

36
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,047
THAT'S NOW HOW I LOOK AT IT,
THOUGH.

37
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,014
I DON'T LOOK AT IT THAT WAY.

38
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,189
- IF WE DO IT YOUR WAY,
WE'RE GONNA BE 90!

39
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:28,088
- I'M ALREADY 90.
- YEAH, EXACTLY.

40
00:01:28,157 --> 00:01:30,504
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HOW YOU ARE
AROUND KIDS, THOUGH.

41
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:32,678
- YOU'VE SEEN ME AROUND KIDS.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

42
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:34,094
- NO, BABY BABIES.
SO WE CAN KIND OF, LIKE,

TO TAKE CARE OF A BABY.

00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:40,790
YOU MOVE
INTO YOUR PARENTS' BASEMENT.

47
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,274
YOU HAVE THEM HELP YOU A LOT.

- OH, MY GOD.

49
00:01:44,345 --> 00:01:46,796
- I HAVEN'T SPENT
A LOT OF TIME WITH A BABY.

50
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:48,177
BABIES DEFINITELY
MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

51
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:49,523
I'M A BIG OGRE.

52
00:01:49,592 --> 00:01:52,526
HOLDING SOMETHING
THAT LITTLE AND DELICATE--

53
00:01:52,595 --> 00:01:53,941
IT'S A SCARY PREMISE.

00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,840
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT,
TO BE HONEST.

55

IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT?

56
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:01,121

ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.

- OF COURSE.
- OR TAKE CARE OF HIM?

61
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:09,681

WHEN NICOLE AND JIONNI
ARE AROUND.

63
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,649

- I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW
THAT ME AND ROGER

71
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:31,530
WENT TO AN ADOPTION PICNIC,

72
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,637
AND IT WAS REALLY AMAZING
AND INFORMATIVE.

73
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,225
THE ONLY THING THAT SUCKED

74
00:02:36,294 --> 00:02:38,848
IS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE
BABIES THERE.

75
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:41,161
SO BECAUSE OF THAT,
I WAS WONDERING

76
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,164
IF YOU AND JIONNI AND ME
GIVE HIM, LIKE, A BABY BOOT CAMP

77
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,958

WHY DON'T YOU AND ROGER
SLEEP OVER?

81
00:02:55,347 --> 00:02:56,762
ME AND JIONNI WILL COOK DINNER,

82
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:58,592
AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE CARE
OF LORENZO ALL NIGHT.

83
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:00,180
- IT'S GONNA TAKE
MORE THAN ONE NIGHT

84
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:01,526
TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE A PARENT.

85
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,769
TO BE HONEST,
ONLY BEING A PARENT

86
00:03:03,838 --> 00:03:06,013
IS GONNA ALLOW YOU
TO BE A PARENT.

87
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:08,049

- I THINK THE BOYS--
THEY PUT IN GREAT EFFORT,

503
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,939
AND THEY REALLY TRIED
TO BUILD THE SWING SET, BUT...

504
00:17:59,008 --> 00:18:00,665
- I'M NOT WASTING ANOTHER DAY.
- HELL, NO.

- GENERAL CONTRACTORS.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

509
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:11,469
- I HAVE A SWING SET HERE
THAT I STARTED,

510
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:14,196
AND I MIGHT NEED SOME HELP
PUTTING IT TOGETHER.

511
00:18:14,265 --> 00:18:16,785
- OKAY. YEAH, WE DO
SWING SETS ALL THE TIME.

512
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:18,614
- ALL RIGHT, BABE, THEY LOOK
LIKE THEY'RE IN GOOD HANDS.

513
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:20,582
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU WANNA GET OUT OF HERE?

514
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:22,411
- LORENZO, SAY BYE.

515
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,103
SAY, "THANK YOU
FOR TAKING CARE OF ME."

516
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:26,105

- BYE, BUDDY.

00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:39,601
BUT YET IF I KNEW THAT I WAS
GONNA HAVE A SON LIKE THAT,

522
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,154
I MIGHT PLANT THAT SEED
TOMORROW.

523
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:43,052
THAT COULD BE A WHOLE PROCESS
IN AND OF ITSELF,

524
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,778

WITH LORENZO, BABY?

LORENZO IS DEFINITELY

00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,203
I DON'T THINK THAT
WE'RE EVER GONNA BE THAT BLESSED

531
00:18:55,272 --> 00:18:57,343
TO HAVE A CHILD
THAT ACTS THAT WELL.

532

- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT, THOUGH,

533
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:01,726
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
IF WE GAVE OUR CHILD

534

AND I WANT TO TELL ROGER
AND JENNI, "I TOLD YOU SO,"

WE NEED PROFESSIONALS,
