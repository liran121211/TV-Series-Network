00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,733
- STOP!
- I LOVE YOU.

2
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:09,333
- STOP. GET OUT.

3
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:10,767
YOU HAVE FIVE SECONDS
TO GET OUT OF MY ASS.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,333
- THAT'S A PILLOW.
MY HAND'S BETWEEN TWO PILLOWS.

5
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:15,233
- STOP. I WANT YOU
TO BE AFFECTIONATE,

6
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:16,800
NOT 'CAUSE YOU WANT TO GET
SOME ASS.

7
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:17,767
- THAT'S THE LAST THING
ON MY MIND.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,400
KISS YOU.
- [squeals]

9
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:22,233
YOU STUPID ASS!

10
00:00:22,267 --> 00:00:24,700
THIS IS NOT ROMANCE.
THIS IS MOLESTATION.

11
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,500
- HOW DOES IT FEEL,
WAKING UP TO THIS?

12
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:28,233
- STOP!

13
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:30,667
[Icona Pop's I Love It]

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,300

00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,233
* I LOVE IT,
I LOVE IT *

[dog yapping]
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

22
00:00:45,433 --> 00:00:49,500
I CAN'T--YOU GUYS ALL
JUMP EACH OTHER.

23
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:50,800
SO I THINK I HAVE
THE BEST PLAN EVER.

24
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:53,733
TO GET MY DOGS
TO GO EVERYWHERE,

25
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:56,133
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD GET THEM
CERTIFIED AS SERVICE DOGS.

26
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:57,633
HEY, YOU GET ON
YOUR SEAT BELT.

27
00:00:57,667 --> 00:00:59,333
BUT FIRST,
I'VE GOTTA TRAIN THEM.

28
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:03,033
MOVE IT! STOP IT!
SIT! RELAX!

29
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:05,367
HOW DID YOU GET CAUGHT
UNDERNEATH THERE, HUH?

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,067
THERE'S NO HOPE.

31
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,500
- COME ON BACK.
I'LL INTRODUCE YOU.

32
00:01:09,533 --> 00:01:11,533
YOU'LL LOVE THIS.
- OH...

33
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,033
- SIT DOWN!
- YEP.

34
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:17,367
- SO THIS IS PETE.
PETE, THIS IS JENNI.

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,100
- HI.
- WHAT A PLEASURE.

36
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:20,500
HOW NICE TO MEET YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

37
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:22,067
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

38
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,333
THEY'RE BEING GOOD RIGHT NOW.

39
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,033
NORMALLY SHE JUST ATTACKS--

40
00:01:25,067 --> 00:01:26,667
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

41
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,233
I'VE ALREADY STAKED OUT
THE TERRITORY.

42
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:33,100
THIS IS MY TERRITORY.
MY DOG IS IN HIS TERRITORY.

43
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:35,333
AND HE'S NOT GONNA MOVE.
- HE WON'T?

44
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:37,467
- OH, NO. NO, NO, NO.
HE'S THERE.

45
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,633
- THIS DOBERMAN PINSCHER HAD
BIGGER BALLS THAN MY HEAD.

46
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:43,033
AND IT, LIKE, COULD EAT
BOTH MY DOGS FOR A SNACK.

47
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,367
AND YET, MY DOGS WOULD NOT
ACKNOWLEDGE HIM.

48
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,667
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS
IN MY LIFE.

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,500
BEFORE WE WALKED IN HERE--
[dogs yapping]

50
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:50,633
WHAT DO YOU DO TO THIS?

51
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,067
- AAH, AAH, AAH, AAH, AAH!

52
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,367
GIVE ME THE LEASH.

53
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,800
LOOK WHAT STOPPED IMMEDIATELY

54
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:58,033
WHEN I TOOK THE LEASH AWAY
FROM YOU.

I DON'T GET THIS.
[dogs stop barking]

56
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,600
YOU DON'T EVEN DO ANYTHING.

57
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:04,100
AND I'M, LIKE, MEETING
GANDHI OF DOGS,

58
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:06,733
WHO JUST, LIKE, HAS THIS
PRESENCE, AND EVERYONE SHUTS UP.

59
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:09,267
- YOU SEE WHAT I JUST DID?
I OWNED IT.

60
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,767
- YOU KNOW, GANDHI.
HE'S IN THE BIBLE.

61
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
HE'S THE GUY THAT LIVES
UP IN THE MOUNTAINS

62
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:15,767
AND GIVES ADVICE FOR FREE.

63
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:21,300
YOU KNOW, PENIS COVER
WRAPPED AROUND HIM.

64
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:26,100
ON HIS ROCK...
SOMEWHERE.

65
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:28,033
OH, MY GOD, ROGER SAID THAT,

66
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,700
"YOU JUST YELL.
YOU DON'T FOLLOW THROUGH."

67
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,700
- YOU SAY IT ONCE--
- DON'T YOU DARE SAY HE'S RIGHT!

68
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,300
- YOU SAY IT ONCE,
MAKE IT HAPPEN.

69
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:37,100
- I [bleep] HATE
WHEN ROGER'S RIGHT.

70
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:39,133
SWEAR.
I [bleep] HATE IT.

71
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:41,033
HOW DO YOU STOP 'EM
FROM BARKING?

72
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,400
- I'VE GOT A SPECIAL TOOL.
IT'S CALLED AN AIR HORN.

73
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:46,200
THEY'RE ALL BARKING
AT EACH OTHER--EHH! ENOUGH!

74
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,333
THE QUEEN HAS SPOKEN!
- I LIKE BEING THE QUEEN.

75
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:49,767
- YEAH. SEE?
READY?

76
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,433
- ONE, TWO, THREE, AND GO.

77
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:53,400
AND SASHAY, AND SASHAY.

78
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:54,800
I FEEL LIKE A PROFESSIONAL
DOG WALKER.

79
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,767
- GO BACK AGAIN.
SEE, YOU'RE INTERESTING NOW.

80
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,100
WHO'S GOOD?
- THIS IS NOT COOL.

81
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,500
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE
FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS

82
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,533
HAS JUST TURNED TO [bleep]
IN THREE SECONDS.

83
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,100
YOU CAN'T TEACH AN OLD DOG
NEW TRICKS.

84
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:08,233
CLEARLY, THAT STATEMENT
IS WRONG.

85
00:03:08,267 --> 00:03:09,567
[dog barks]
UGH.

86
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,567
I GOTTA GO GET AN AIR HORN.

87
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,133
*

88
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,767
- OW!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

89
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,667
- I'M GONNA TEST OUT
MY BOUNCE SHOES.

90
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,767
- WE'RE PACKING.
OH, MY GOD.

91
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,533
- CAN YOU SEE ME RUNNING
DOWN THE STREET EXERCISING?

92
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:27,733
- AND I'D LAUGH AT YOU.
THIS ISN'T CALIFORNIA.

93
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:30,467
PEOPLE WILL THROW [bleep] AT YOU
WEARING THINGS LIKE THAT.

94
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,333
- UGH! OOH!

95
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,700
DON'T I LOOK LIKE A MOM?

96
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:36,667
- YEP, JUST LIKE ONE.

97
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,367
- I'M DYING.

98
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,167
I'M GONNA BRING THESE.

99
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,133
- * YOU'VE BEEN DIPPING
IN MY LOVE TOO LONG *

100
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:49,033
*

101
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:52,367
- EWW! THAT'S A TRAILER?

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,767
LOOKS LIKE A HORSE
SHOULD BE IN IT.

103
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,500
THIS IS SO HICK.
- A HORSE CAN'T FIT IN THERE.

104
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,233
AND THERE WAS NO THING
FOR HIS HEAD TO BREATHE.

105
00:03:58,267 --> 00:03:59,633
- OKAY, A PONY. A PONY.

106
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:00,667
- THERE WAS NOTHING FOR HIM
TO BREATHE IN.

107
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,767
- A DONKEY.

108
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,633
- I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE SIZE.

109
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,033
I'M SAYING HE CAN'T BREATHE.

110
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,800
- [chuckles]
A SHEEP.

111
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,600
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING
THE PURPOSE.

112
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:15,300
- EWW!
IT SMELLS LIKE DONKEY POOP.

113
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:21,467
AREN'T I STRONG?
LIKE, YEAH!

114
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,033
[grunts]
WHOA!

115
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:26,067
ALL RIGHT, YOU GET THIS ONE.

116
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:34,133
- * PLAYING WITH MY PILLOW

117
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:37,667
* LOOKIN' FOR NEW WAYS
TO LAY *

118
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,700
* SLEEP

119
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:41,033
- DID YOU HEAR A BARK?

120
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,433
- NO.
DID YOU TRAIN 'EM TODAY?

121
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,800
- ELECTRIC SHOCK THERAPY.
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

122
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:48,800
NO, YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT.
- I WISH YOU WERE THERE.

123
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:52,800
I WALK IN THE BACK DOOR,
I MEET GANDHI.

124
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,567
GANDHI OF THE DOGS.

125
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,600
A DOBERMAN IS BEHIND HIM,
JUST SITTING.

126
00:04:57,633 --> 00:05:00,700
NOT ONE OF OUR DOGS BARKED,
LOOKED AT HIM,

127
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,100
OR WENT AFTER HIM.

128
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,533
- SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S ON QUAALUDES.

129
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:06,133
WHY IS SHE OUT LIKE THAT?

130
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:08,700
I FEEL FAIRLY CONFIDENT
THAT BELLA IS DEAD RIGHT NOW.

131
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,700
LOOK AT HER. SHE'S DEAD.

132
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:12,133
OH, NO, THE EYE MOVED.

133
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,367
- YOU SURE THEY DIDN'T
GET DRUGGED?

134
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,600
'CAUSE I'VE NEVER SEEN--
- SWEAR TO GOD.

135
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,533
- OH, MY GOD, THAT IS, HONESTLY,
THE BEST I'VE EVER SEEN 'EM.

136
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,033
- I WOULD NEVER DRUG
MY DOGS.

137
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,600
- I DIDN'T SAY YOU.

138
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:23,533
I WOULDN'T ALLOW THE GANDHI
TO DRUG MY DOGS EITHER.

139
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,800
- WHEN DID YOU GET JEWISH?

140
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,300
WHERE DID THAT JEWISH SLANG
COME FROM?

141
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,600
- GANDHI'S NOT JEWISH.

142
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,033
- OFF TO THERAPY WE GO.

143
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:39,733
- * YOU KNOW I JUST WOULDN'T
MISS IT FOR THE WORLD *

144
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,567
- ME AND ROGER ARE HEADING
TO COUPLES' THERAPY,

145
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,433
AND IT'S OUR FIRST SESSION.

146
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:46,700
- I'M BEING VERY OPTIMISTIC
ABOUT THIS THERAPY SESSION.

147
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:47,700
- HI, I'M RICK PORESKY.

148
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:48,700
HOW ARE YOU?
- HEY.

149
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,067
- JENNI.
- WELCOME.

150
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,700
VERY NICE TO SEE YOU.
PLEASE TAKE SEATS.

151
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,267
- YOU KNOW, THE ULTIMATE GOAL
WOULD BE

152
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,133
WE'RE HERE TO GET HELP.
- AND NOT KILL EACH OTHER.

153
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,367
- AND NOT KILL EACH OTHER.
YES.

154
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,033
- SO THESE SESSIONS USUALLY
BEGIN WITH WHAT ARE THE ISSUES?

155
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:04,700
WHAT ARE THE MAIN THINGS THAT
YOU WANT US TO BE FOCUSING ON?

156
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,767
- YOU WANT TO START THERE,
MY LOVE?

157
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,033
- WE BUTT HEADS 'CAUSE WE'RE
BOTH ALPHA IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

158
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:12,067
AND THEN ON TOP OF IT,
IT'S EXPLOSIVE.

159
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,533
- SHE WENT BAT [bleep] CRAZY

160
00:06:14,567 --> 00:06:16,500
AND KICKED THE LIVING HELL
OUT OF THE CLOSET DOOR.

161
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,033
- I WENT JACKIE CHAN ON IT.

162
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,733
- HOW MANY HOLES IN WALLS
OR DOORS ARE THERE

163
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,033
IN YOUR HOUSE?

164
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:23,400
- I KICKED IN TWO DOORS.

165
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:25,767
- I THINK I'VE DONE
AT LEAST TWO MYSELF.

166
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,467
THEY ALL GET FIXED IN ABOUT
A DAY 'CAUSE WE'RE SO ANAL.

167
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,667
WE HAVE AN ON-CALL
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY

168
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,033
ON STANDBY, AND KEEPS 'EM
IN STOCK, BASICALLY.

169
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,533
- PRE-PAINTED AND EVERYTHING.
- YEAH.

170
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:38,200
- YOU FEEL YOU NEED DRAMA,
SO YOU'RE GONNA--

171
00:06:38,233 --> 00:06:40,433
- DRAMA JUST TO GET
ATTENTION,

172
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,100
BECAUSE I FEEL
UNAPPRECIATED.

173
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:45,533
LIKE KISSING AND HOLDING
AND CUDDLING--IT'S VERY RARE.

174
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:46,467
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

175
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,700
- I KNOW THAT I NEED
TO WORK ON ROMANCE.

176
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,667
I KNOW THAT, BUT I JUST WOULD
LIKE TO WALK IN THE ROOM

177
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,500
AND PULL JENNI'S SKIRT DOWN
AND RAVAGE HER.

178
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,033
- UGH.

179
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,567
- AND SHE IS NOTHING ABOUT THAT
AT ALL.

180
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
- NO, IT'S TURNING ME OFF
AT THIS POINT.

181
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,633
- I'M EXTREMELY ATTRACTED
TO HER.

182
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:06,033
- SHE'S A SEXY LADY.

183
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:08,467
- YEAH, HE WANTS A STRIPPER...

184
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,067
THAT DOESN'T TALK.

185
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,800
- I HAD ALL THE STRIPPERS.
I DON'T WANT THAT ANYMORE.

186
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,400
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT!

187
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,800
- I DON'T WANT THAT ANYMORE.

188
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,333
I--I WANT A GIRL
THAT LOOKS LIKE A STRIPPER...

189
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:18,567
- YEAH.

190
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,700
- BUT I CAN SHOW
TO MOM AND DAD TOO.

191
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,667
[laughs]
- YOU HAD STRIPPERS?

192
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,033
- GET OUTTA HERE.

193
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,067
- AS A HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT,

194
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,633
I WANT YOU GUYS TO MAKE A LIST

195
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:31,267
OF WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE
TO ACCOMPLISH BEFORE MARRIAGE.

196
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,333
- MAYBE START WITH...
- SEX?

197
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,733
- HOW TO...
- SORRY.

198
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:38,233
- CONTROL THE ANGER.
- YES.

199
00:07:38,267 --> 00:07:40,567
- SEX WILL BE ON THE AGENDA
FOR NEXT TIME--

200
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,733
- US, OR?
OH, US. OKAY.

201
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:45,267
- IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.
- [chuckles]

202
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,667
TOUCHE, MY FRIEND!

203
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,767
MAYBE THIS IS WHAT WE NEED
TO SPARK OUR SEX LIFE.

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,133
HAVE A THREE-WAY
WITH OUR THERAPIST.

205
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,567
I'M IN IF YOU'RE IN.
[bleep] IT.

206
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
- CAN SOMEONE JUST HAVE SEX
WITH HIM

207
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:56,733
SO HE LEAVES ME ALONE?

208
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,633
I JUST THREW UP IN MY MOUTH.
- [chuckles]

209
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:02,200
*

210
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:06,367
- I GOT YOU A LITTLE LIFE VEST,
A BEACH BALL.

211
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,167
AND I GOT A FIRST-AID KIT
FOR YOU.

212
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,633
- OKAY.
- YOU'LL CALL ME BY NEXT WEEK.

213
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:12,300
- I'LL PROBABLY TEXT YOU
EVERY DAY.

214
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,033
CAN YOU REMIND ME THAT I NEED TO
GO TO CVS BEFORE WE LEAVE?

215
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,433
'CAUSE I NEED TO GET
MY BIRTH CONTROL.

216
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:20,067
- YES, I WILL DEFINITELY
REMIND YOU OF THAT.

217
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,667
- 'CAUSE IF I DON'T GET
THE BIRTH CONTROL, THEN...

218
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,200
BABY NUMBER TWO.

219
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:27,533
- NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

220
00:08:27,567 --> 00:08:29,500
LET'S GO TO THE STORE.

221
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:32,667
- YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK
MY MOTHER.

222
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,267
IT'S AWKWARD.

223
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,133
- NO, I'M, LIKE,
HER DAUGHTER, KIND OF.

224
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:37,167
- IT'S AWKWARD.

225
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,733
- WHEE!

226
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:41,767
- OH, DA DA.

227
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
MWAH.

228
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,767
- I'M EXHAUSTED.

229
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,300
- YEAH, I'M TIRED.
SO IS THIS GUY.

230
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:50,033
- WE SHOULD REST,
GET GOOD SLEEP,

231
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,033
AND THEN WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING

232
00:08:51,067 --> 00:08:52,500
ALL READY TO GO AND EXCITED.

233
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,300
AND THEN WE GET THERE.
- BEDTIME FOR EVERYONE.

234
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,367
- DO YOU WANNA WRITE DOWN
OUR PROBLEMS?

235
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,533
- WE COULD START IT.
HOW 'BOUT THAT?

236
00:09:01,567 --> 00:09:02,800
- THE HOMEWORK?

237
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,333
- THIS IS NOT GONNA BE
ENOUGH PAPER.

238
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:06,267
- I KNOW. COME ON, LET'S GO
IN THE DINING ROOM.

239
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,800
I'M GOING TO TRY AND TAKE THIS
HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT SERIOUS.

240
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,733
ONE ASSIGNMENT IS,
I HAVE TO WRITE A LIST

241
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,467
OF WHAT I WANT TO WORK ON
WITH MYSELF.

242
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,567
AND THE OTHER LIST IS
WHAT ME AND ROGER

243
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,800
WANNA WORK ON TOGETHER
AS A COUPLE,

244
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:20,200
TO, YOU KNOW, BETTER OURSELVES
AND OUR RELATIONSHIP.

245
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,433
GLAD YOU'RE TAKING THIS SERIOUS.

246
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,633
- YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO READ MY LIST.

247
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:34,333
- THE FIRST THING I NOTICE IS
"JENNI" AND "BUTT HOLE."

248
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:36,400
SO I CAN IMAGINE
WHAT HIS FIRST THING IS.

249
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:39,100
WHAT PROBLEMS
DO YOU SEE US HAVING?

250
00:09:39,133 --> 00:09:41,767
- I SEE US STILL IMPROVED

251
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,033
BUT STILL FAILING IN THE
COMMUNICATION DEPARTMENT.

252
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:47,300
YOU?
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

253
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,500
- PATIENCE.

254
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,267
YOU NEED TO WORK
ON YOUR PATIENCE,

255
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,667
AND SO DO I.

256
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,767
- OH, OKAY,
I WAS GONNA SAY.

257
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,733
A LACK OF INTIMACY,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

258
00:09:57,767 --> 00:10:01,667
I FEEL LIKE--I FEEL LIKE
MAYBE YOU HAVE A REASON

259
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,600
FOR NOT RECIPROCATING, EVEN
THOUGH I WOULDN'T [bleep] YOU

260
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:04,800
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT.

261
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,067
- [groans]
WHO SAYS THAT

262
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,500
TO THEIR FIANCEE?

263
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:12,733
COME ON! THAT MAKES ME NOT
WANT TO GIVE YOU ANYTHING.

264
00:10:12,767 --> 00:10:14,333
SMELL MY FINGERS.
- OH!

265
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:15,600
THAT'S THE CLOSEST
I'VE GOTTEN TO SEX.

266
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:16,600
[inhaling deeply]

267
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:17,733
- [laughs]

268
00:10:17,767 --> 00:10:18,667
- WHY DO YOU
COMPLICATE STUFF?

269
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,667
WE'RE MEN, BABE.
WE'RE SIMPLEMINDED PEOPLE.

270
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,667
- NO.

271
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,633
- WE ARE.
- NO.

272
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:26,167
- ALL RIGHT, BABY,
LET'S GO TO BED.

273
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,433
- WHO AM I DATING?

274
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,700
I'M GONNA BECOME
A LESBIAN AFTER THIS.

275
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:30,567
DID YOU JUST FART?

276
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,400
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

277
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,467
- [laughs]

278
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,567
- * OH, WHAT A DAY, OH,
WHAT A DAY, OH, WHAT A DAY *

279
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,600
- SIT.

280
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:46,033
SIT.

281
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:48,633
- YOU PUSHED HER ASS
TO THE GROUND.

282
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,467
- BABE, IT'S A PROCESS.
- [laughs]

283
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,533
- IT'S A PROC--IT'S LIKE
TRYING TO TEACH ANNE FRANK.

284
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,700
IT WAS A [bleep] PROCESS.
SHE WAS BLIND AND DEAF.

285
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:59,100
PICTURE THEM
BLIND AND DEAF.

286
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,433
SIT.

287
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,267
ANNE FRANK.

288
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,067
SIT. NO.

289
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,267
SSS--
[groans]

290
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,767
HELEN KELLER!
THAT'S WHO I MEANT.

291
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
[bleep] ME.
I KNEW I HAD IT WRONG.

292
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:14,667
OH, THE JEWISH GIRL

293
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,533
SIT.

294
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:18,433
- WOULDN'T A CATTLE PROD
WORK QUICKER?

295
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:19,733
- SHE'LL GET IT ONE DAY.

296
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,267
- SHE'LL BE RIDING
A UNICYCLE IN DAYS.

297
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,533
- I HOPE YOU GET SHOT
IN THE FACE ONE DAY.

298
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:24,767
- [laughs]

299
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,600
- * COME BACK HOME TO ME

300
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:30,767
* AND I WISH
THAT YOU WOULD *

301
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
* COME BACK HOME TO ME

302
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,267
- [grunts]

303
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,100
- THIS IS IT, BABY.
LET'S DO THIS.

304
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:37,667
- BYE. I LOVE YOU.
- BE CAREFUL.

305
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,533
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, CALL ME.
- OKAY.

306
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,267
SEE YOU SOON.
- BE CAREFUL, DRIVING.

307
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,733
MAKE SURE YOU CALL ME
AS SOON AS YOU GET THERE.

308
00:11:42,767 --> 00:11:45,700
- THIS IS THE MOMENT WE'VE
BEEN WAITING FOR FOREVER--

309
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,300
MOVING OUT OF THE BASEMENT.

310
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,667
- AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT
UNPACKING EVERYTHING

311
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,300
ALL AT ONE TIME.

312
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,533
JUST RELAX A LITTLE BIT.

313
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:54,500
- LIKE, [bleep] FINALLY.

314
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:55,667
[horn honks]

315
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,667

317
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,700
[rock music]

318
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:03,067
- THERE IT IS!

319
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,800
*

320
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,100
- I CAN'T WAIT TO OPEN
THIS HOUSE AND GET IN AND--

321
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:10,167
- OPEN THE HOUSE?
IS IT A PRESENT?

322
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,433
- SHUT UP!

323
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:15,033
- WELCOME HOME, LORENZO.

324
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,233
WHEE!

OUR HOUSE FOR THE SUMMER,

327
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,033
AND THIS IS GONNA BE
OUR TEST RUN

328
00:12:22,067 --> 00:12:24,600
TO SEE IF WE CAN ACTUALLY
DO THIS.

329
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:27,300
WANT TO SEE OUTSIDE?

330
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,133
WOW!

331
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,333
OH, MY GOODNESS!

LOOK AT THE WATER.
HE'S SO HAPPY!

333
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,667
- WE'RE ON THE WATER.
IT'S NICE, IT'S CLEAN.

334
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,100
- IT'S CLASSY.

335
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,600
WELCOME HOME!

336
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:41,600
- I MEAN, YOU CAN'T ASK FOR
A BETTER SUMMER HOUSE.

337
00:12:41,633 --> 00:12:42,600
- IT'S PERFECT.

338
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:45,267
- HEY, YOU.
- HELLO?

339
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,233
- HI.

340

IT DEPENDS IF
I HAVE MY PERIOD TOO.

426
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:24,233
YOU CAN'T HAVE SEX
THAT WEEK.

427
00:15:24,267 --> 00:15:25,333

- WHOO!

444
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,567
LORENZO NEEDS TO LAY DOWN
FOR HIS NAP

445
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,767
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
HE HAD A BIG DAY.

446
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,667
WE'RE MOVING IN.

447
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,767
AND ME AND JENNI,
WE JUST NEED TO CATCH UP

448
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,367
ON SOME GIRL TIME

TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS
COUPLES THERAPY.

450
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,600
- HE NEEDS TO BE
MORE AFFECTIONATE

451
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,700
OR IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

452
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,167
- MM-HMM.

453
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,700
IT'S JUST ALL GUYS.

454
00:16:10,733 --> 00:16:13,667
- NO, 'CAUSE I'VE MET GUYS
THAT ARE JUST GENUINELY--

455
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,333
YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER LOOK
AT SOMEONE

456
00:16:15,367 --> 00:16:17,300
WHO'S LIKE, OH, THAT'S SUCH
A GREAT COUPLE, LIKE--?

457
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,100
- NOT REALLY?
- NO.

458
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:20,433
- 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE ME
AND JIONNI'S RELATIONSHIP

459
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:23,033
IS PERFECT.

460
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:25,167
I MEAN, I WOULD LIKE HIM
TO BE MORE AFFECTIONATE.

461
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,033
- ODDLY ENOUGH,
ME AND NICOLE

462
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,733
KIND OF HAVE THE SAME
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEM.

463
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:30,233
WE BOTH WANT
MORE AFFECTION.

464
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:31,767
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS,

465
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,400
NICOLE IS THE SUBMISSIVE ONE
IN HER RELATIONSHIP,

466
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:36,567
AND I WILL NOT SUBMIT
TO ANYONE.

467
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,033
I-I WROTE DOWN WHAT I NEED TO
WORK ON IN MY RELATIONSHIP.

468
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,800
- MM-HMM.
- WHAT ROGER NEEDS TO WORK ON.

469
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,600
AND WHAT, AS A COUPLE,
WE NEED TO WORK ON.

470
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:47,033
I PUT,
MY COMMUNICATION WITH HIM,

471
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:50,200
MY TEMPER, MY SELFISHNESS,
MY INDEPENDENCE,

472
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:52,733
MY LAZINESS, AND I NEED TO BE
MORE SPONTANEOUS.

473
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,433
- DID HE HAVE TO MAKE
THE SAME LIST?

474
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:56,467
- YEAH.
- SO, WHAT'S ON HIS LIST?

475
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,167
OR, YOU DIDN'T SEE IT?

476
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,267
- I DON'T KNOW IF I'M SUPPOSED
TO SHARE THESE OR NOT,

477
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,767
BUT--AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
TAKE THIS SERIOUS.

478
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,433
- [laughs]

479
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:07,233
- THIS IS ISSUES I WISH
JENNI WOULD WORK ON.

480
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:10,700
NUMBER ONE, I HAVE, "JENNI WILL
NOT LET ME IN HER B[bleep]."

481
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:13,700
- [laughs]

482
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,533
- [laughs]
IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE.

483
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:17,800
- OH.

484
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:18,767
- I'M ACTUALLY A LITTLE
UPSET OVER THAT.

485
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,200
- HE WROTE ON MY LIST.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

486
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:25,767
- HE WROTE ON
MY LIST, "BE MORE FLEXIBLE,

487
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,033
"LEARN HOW TO PUT MY FEET
BEHIND MY EARS,

488
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:30,333
BE MORE OPEN TO ORAL SEX."

489
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,400
- EVERYTHING IS SEX
WITH THIS GUY.

490
00:17:32,433 --> 00:17:34,267
- "BE MORE OPEN TO HEINIE SEX."
- THAT'S SO ANNOYING.

491
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,733
EW! HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT?
- SEE? THIS IS WHY I--

492
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:38,567
- EWEY. I WOULD WALK AWAY.
- [laughs]

493
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,767
- AT LEAST THREE TIMES A DAY,
EVERY DAY,

494
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,300
I'VE GOT TO HAVE SEX
WITH HER.

495
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,133
- GET OUT OF HERE.
- NEVER, EVER WORKS OUT.

496
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,200
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,
WHEN I WAKE UP,

497
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,500
I TRY TO HAVE SEX
WITH JENNI.

498
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:46,733
I COME HOME FROM WORK.

499
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:48,300
USUALLY, YOU KNOW,
I'LL COME IN THE BATHROOM.

500
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,433
- SHE'LL BE, LIKE,
DOING HER MAKEUP.

501
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,733
I'LL DROP HER DRAWERS.
NOTHING.

502
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,200
"GET THE [bleep] OFF ME."

503
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,033
SWINGING AT ME
WITH THE HAIRDRYER AND [bleep].

504
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:56,433
- I'M WAITING FOR A HUG
AND A KISS, AND "I LOVE YOU."

505
00:17:56,467 --> 00:18:00,100
- AND FLOWERS.
- AND FAT-FREE CANDY.

506
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,667
- AND WHEN I DO GET IT,
THERE'S ZERO PARTICIPATION.

507
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,600
- OH, MAN,

508
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:06,033
- AND THEN,
WHEN I DO DO IT,

509
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,333
IT SOUNDS LIKE

00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:20,367
- YEAH, LET ME JUST
GRILL THAT.

518
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,667

IT'S KIND OF LIKE DOGS.

534
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,633
THEY DO SOMETHING YOU WANT,
YOU REWARD 'EM WITH A TREAT.

535
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,267
I LOVE YOU.

536
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,800
- MY TREAT COULD BE SEX.

537
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,267
HARDCORE,
PUNISHING SEX.

- HE DESERVES SOMETHING
TONIGHT.

539
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:09,600

00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:11,400
- NO, I DIDN'T SAY [bleep].

541
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,233
I SAID HE DESERVES IT.

542
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:14,800

00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:22,467
AND WHY DON'T WE JUST SET OUT

583
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,200
