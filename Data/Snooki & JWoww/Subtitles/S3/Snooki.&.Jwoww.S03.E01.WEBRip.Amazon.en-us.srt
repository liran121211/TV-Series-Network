1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,806
- THE LAST TIME YOU SAW US,
WE WERE JUST YOUNG AND STUPID.

2
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,141
- [burps]
- DID YOU JUST FART?

3
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,276
- [laughs]

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,878
NOW WE'RE MATURE AND SEXY.

5
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:12,313
[imitates horse whinny]

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,547
[cheering]

7
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:14,648
- HE'S GONNA WALK.
- OH, MY GOD!

8
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,184
- AAH!

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,087
JIONNI AND I, WE'RE PRETTY USED
TO PARENTHOOD NOW.

10
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:20,088
[gasps]

11
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:21,655
- PFFT.

12
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:23,657
- CAN YOU REMIND ME THAT I NEED
TO GET MY BIRTH CONTROL?

13
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,459
- YES. I WILL DEFINITELY
REMIND YOU OF THAT.

14
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,927
- STOP!
- BABE, I LOVE YOU.

15
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,396
- YOU HAVE FIVE SECONDS
TO GET OUT OF MY ASS.

16
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:29,797
ME AND ROGER'S RELATIONSHIP

17
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,699
IS BASICALLY THE SAME [bleep],
DIFFERENT TOILET.

18
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,000
LET ME ENJOY MY MOMENT.

19
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,001
WE FIGHT...
[laughs]

20
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:35,803
YOU STUPID ASS!

21
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,937
WE DON'T HAVE SEX LIKE USUAL.

22
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,539
BUT WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS.

23
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,873
DIESEL, SAVE YOUR MOMMY!

24
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,842
- I'M SO EXCITED!

25
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,411
WE'RE GONNA GO OUT.
WE'RE GONNA ENJOY OURSELVES.

26
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:44,412
WE'RE GONNA DRINK.
WE'RE GONNA PARTY.

27
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:45,413
- [grunts]

28
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,580
- HOW DO YOU PEE IN THIS?

29
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,515
- WE'RE MAKING
NEW MEMORIES NOW.

30
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,782
IT'S LIKE A NEW CHAPTER.

31
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,651
- WHOO!
- [laughs]

32
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:52,686
- YOUR FAT ASS BROKE IT.

33
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:54,888
- * I DON'T CARE *

34
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:56,657
* I LOVE IT *

35
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:58,626
* I DON'T CARE *

36
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,561
* I LOVE IT,
I LOVE IT *

37
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:02,730
* I DON'T CARE *

38
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,666
* I LOVE IT *

39
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,635
* I DON'T CARE *

40
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,206
- CAN I HAVE SOME SUGAR?

41
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,177
I HAVE BUTTERFLIES.
- WHY?

42
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,911
- IT'S LIKE THE FIRST TIME.

43
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,748
CAN I JUST HAVE ONE KISS?

44
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,816
JIONNI, WHAT ARE YOU,
FIVE?

45
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:23,817
[laughs]
STOP.

46
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,187
- [humming]

47
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,956
SERIOUSLY?
IT'S DISGUSTING.

48
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,691
- MOM.
- OH, MY GOD. I'M SWEATING.

49
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:32,025
- YOU'LL END UP
PREGNANT AGAIN.

50
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,162
- I LOVE JANIS
AND EVERYONE.

51
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:36,430
- WE JUST NEED PRIVACY,
OKAY?

52
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:38,832
IT'S HARDER IN THE BASEMENT
TO BE ROMANTIC.

53
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,802
- YES.
- WE NEED OUR OWN HOUSE.

54
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,871
THANKS FOR DOING
OUR CLOTHES.

55
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,707
- YOU SAY THAT EVERY NIGHT.
- THANK YOU. BYE.

56
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,276
- LOOK, YOU'RE GETTING
SO BIG.

57
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,178
- YOU'RE GONNA BE ONE SOON.

58
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,480
- YOU REALLY ARE TAKING UP TOO
MUCH SPACE DOWN HERE.

59
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:56,550
- YOU TOOK OVER.
WE NEED A BIGGER PLACE.

60
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,187
THE BASEMENT IS A GOOD SIZE
IF YOU'RE SINGLE.

61
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,821
THAT USED TO BE
YOUR POOL TABLE.

62
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:01,922
THAT'S NOT
YOUR POOL TABLE ANYMORE.

63
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,324
HIS DIAPERS
ARE ON YOUR BAR.

64
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:04,725
WELL, WITH LORENZO
IN THE PICTURE,

65
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:05,959
IT'S JUST EVERYTHING
JUST GETS MORE CRAMPED,

66
00:02:06,026 --> 00:02:07,461
AND THERE'S MORE TOYS,
AND, YOU KNOW,

67
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:09,897
WE JUST NEED MORE SPACE
FOR OUR SON.

68
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,499
HALF THE BASEMENT IS HIS.

69
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,335
- MAMA TOOK DADDY'S CLOSET.
- OH, MY GOD.

70
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:16,637
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO GO
IN THE BOILER ROOM.

71
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,406
- THE BOILER ROOM
IS MY CLOSET.

72
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,040
- BUT YOU WANTED TO GO
IN THERE.

73
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:22,276
- NO, I DIDN'T WANT TO GO.
- I DIDN'T PUSH HIM IN THERE.

74
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:23,544
- I DIDN'T WANT TO GO
IN THE BOILER ROOM.

75
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:24,745
- YEAH, YOU SAID,
"I HAVE A GREAT IDEA.

76
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,314
WHY DON'T I GO
IN THE BOILER ROOM?"

77
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,448
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
"LET'S GO IN THE BOILER ROOM."

78
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,550
- AND I SAID, "YES!
MY OWN CLOSET."

79
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,118
- BUT WE REALLY NEED TO DO
SOMETHING.

80
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,854
- THAT'S WHY IT'S THE PERFECT
TIME TO MOVE OUT.

81
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:37,725
THIS SUMMER, I AM RENTING
MY OWN SHORE HOUSE FOR ME,

82
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,126
JIONNI, AND LORENZO.

83
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:40,261
IT'S KIND OF LIKE A TEST.

84
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:41,595
LIKE,
WE'RE GONNA PLAY HOUSE

85
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,265
TO SEE HOW WE ARE JUST,
LIKE, BY OURSELVES.

86
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:47,100
ARE YOU NERVOUS AT ALL
TO BE ON YOUR OWN?

87
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:48,369
- I'M NERVOUS 'CAUSE,
LIKE,

88
00:02:48,436 --> 00:02:49,470
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
ANYBODY UPSTAIRS.

89
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:50,604
- OH, HE'S SWEATY.

90
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,839
- THIS IS, LIKE,
LEGIT ON OUR OWN.

91
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,607
IF WE SCREW UP,
MY MOM IS UPSTAIRS.

92
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,908
IN THE HOUSE, SHE'S NOT.

93
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,244
- REMEMBER THAT ONE TIME

94
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,278
HE [bleep] ALL THE WAY
UP HIS NECK?

95
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:58,546
- YEAH.
- AND YOUR MOM HELPED US.

96
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:00,781
- YEAH.
- PFFT.

97
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,450
- GUARANTEED,
WE MISS HER IN A WEEK.

98
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,253
- DEPEND ON NOBODY
BUT OURSELVES.

99
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,487
WHO'S GONNA TELL HER?

100
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,857
- UM, YOU,
BECAUSE YOU'RE HER SON.

101
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,259
- YOU KNOW, IF WE GO DOWN
TO THE SHORE,

102
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,960
OUR MOMS ARE GONNA
FREAK OUT, RIGHT?

103
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:13,994
- BUT WE'VE GOT TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

104
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,296
- OH, MY GOD.

105
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,598
WE'RE SCREWED.
- YEAH, WE'RE SCREWED.

106
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,367
both: WE'RE GOING DOWN
TO THE SHORE.

107
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,934
WE'RE GOING
DOWN TO THE SHORE.

108
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:23,271
- FIST BUMP.
- DON'T.

109
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,272
- YOU'RE GONNA GO TO KARMA
AND GO,

110
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,974
"BOM, BOM, BOM, BOM, BOM."

111
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,409
NEVER MIND.

112
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:30,278
- YOU ARE NOT GOING TO KARMA.
- NO FIST BUMP?

113
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,979
- THERE'S KOOKY GIRLS
AT KARMA.

114
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,113
- THAT'S WHERE DADDY
MET MOMMY.

115
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,482
- THERE'S KOOKY GIRLS
AT KARMA.

116
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,716
- [laughs]

117
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:39,119
HEY, JIONNI!
[laughs]

118
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,889
both: MMM.

119
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,392
- * TAKIN' BAD BOYS
HOME WITH ME *

120
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,559
* TAKE 'EM BACK... *

121
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,761
- HEY, BABE.
- HI.

122
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:48,929
- WHAT YOU DOING?

123
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,565
- SOMEONE POOPED
IN THE HALLWAY.

124
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,301
BELLA TOOK A [bleep]
ON THE RUG OUTSIDE,

125
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,436
AND DIESEL HELD IT
THE WHOLE TIME.

126
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:57,838
- HE'S THE BEST DOG.
YOU'VE GOTTA SAY, HE REALLY IS.

127
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,106
- [barks]
- REST MY CASE.

128
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,541
- THANKS.

129
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:02,776
SHE--I'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND
THAT ABOUT HER.

130
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:04,478
SHE FREAKS OUT.

131
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:05,979
- THAT'S WHY I'LL BE RAISING OUR
CHILDREN, IF WE EVER HAVE ANY.

132
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:07,615
- DIESEL IS MY CHILD.

133
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,083
- NO, I DON'T CONSIDER
THOSE TWO MY DOGS.

134
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,585
- WELL, WHY AREN'T MY CHILDREN
YOUR CHILDREN?

135
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:12,986
- THEY KIND OF ARE.

136
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,888
THEY'RE LIKE ILLEGITIMATE
STEPCHILDREN, LIKE.

137
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:16,189
- YOU ARE, LIKE,
0 FOR 10 RIGHT NOW.

138
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:17,525
- I'LL TAKE NOELLE.

139
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,759
IF THERE WAS A DIVORCE,

140
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:21,362
AND YOU PERISHED,
I WOULD TAKE NOELLE.

141
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,497
- IF I DIE IN A HORRIFIC
CAR ACCIDENT TOMORROW,

142
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,998
YOU WOULD NOT TAKE CARE
OF BELLA FOR ME?

143
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,767
- YOU WOULD SEE BELLA
IN A STOREFRONT WINDOW,

144
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:27,868
LOOKING FOR A HOME.

145
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,102
- WHY AM I DATING YOU?

146
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,103
THIS IS WHY I'M NOT
GETTING MARRIED.

147
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,873
- [laughs]
- [bleep]

148
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,041
- [clears throat]

149
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,609
WHERE IS YOUR RING,
BY THE WAY?

150
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:38,346
- OH, IT'S UPSTAIRS IN THE
BATHROOM, WHEN I WAS CLEANING.

151
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:39,680
- SO, YOU JUST DON'T
PUT IT BACK ON?

152
00:04:39,747 --> 00:04:41,014
YOU JUST LEAVE IT HANGING?

153
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,883
BASICALLY, I GAVE UP
BOTH OF MY KIDNEYS

154
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,218
AND MY FIRSTBORN CHILD
FOR THIS RING,

155
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,720
AND I THINK JENNI
NEEDS TO WEAR IT MORE.

156
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,955
I LET CHICKS KNOW
IMMEDIATELY.

157
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,357
I'M, LIKE,
"I'M TAKEN, GIRL."

158
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,191
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING
THAT SAYS YOU'RE TAKEN.

159
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,860
- IF I WANTED TO GET MARRIED
TOMORROW TO YOU,

160
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:56,029
YOU KNOW YOU'D GET MARRIED.

161
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,631
WHAT?

162
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:58,899
- I THOUGHT WE WERE ON
THE SAME PAGE WITH THE WEDDING.

163
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,369
I THOUGHT
WE DISCUSSED THAT, AND...

164
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:03,136
- I DON'T KNOW. I THINK
WE BOTH HAVE COLD FEET.

165
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:05,105
BUT I'M JUST SAYING THOUGH,
LIKE, IF I DRAGGED YOU

166
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,940
TO THE ALTAR, I FEEL
LIKE YOU'D SAY YES.

167
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,175
- [laughs]

168
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,478
- US GIRLS LOVE TO
TEST OUR MEN,

169
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:11,979
AND I KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO
GET MARRIED TOMORROW,

170
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,382
BUT IF I ASK HIM, YOU KNOW,
"WOULD YOU

171
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,283
GET MARRIED TOMORROW,"
I WANT HIM TO SAY, "YES."

172
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,686
- YEAH, NO, I'M NOT READY
TO GET MARRIED THIS WEEKEND, NO.

173
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,253
- NO?

174
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:22,490
- YOU HAVE SAID,
UP UNTIL TEN MINUTES AGO,

175
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:23,957
"I DON'T WANT TO GET MARRIED."

176
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,459
SO, WHERE IS THIS--ALL THIS
COMING FROM?

177
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,060
I DON'T GET IT. YOU'RE
BLOWING ME AWAY RIGHT NOW.

178
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,863
- OH, MY GOD. LIKE, THIS IS WHAT
I DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS.

179
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,566
WHAT ROGER IS DOING RIGHT NOW
WITH THE NEGATIVE BULL[bleep]

180
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,935
IS THE REASON
WHY WE NEED THERAPY.

181
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:39,873
- IF IT WASN'T FOR NEGATIVITY,
YOU WOULD HAVE NO "TIVITY."

182
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,878
- YOU GOOD?
- NO, YOU JUST PISS ME OFF.

183
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,414
- [laughs]

184
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:48,482
- TODAY, I'M MEETING JENNI
AT NOT JUST DESSERTS,

185
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,317
ONE OF THOSE
BAKE-A-CAKE PLACES.

186
00:05:50,418 --> 00:05:52,920
I CAN MAKE BROWNIES GOOD,
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BAKE.

187
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:54,755
EVEN THOUGH I'M REALLY BAD
AT IT, YOU KNOW,

188
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:55,856
YOU'VE GOTTA LEARN.

189
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,425
IT'S FOR LORENZO'S SAKE.

190
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,759
- I MEAN, THIS SHOULD BE
NO PROBLEM, RIGHT?

191
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,761
IT CAN'T BE THAT HARD.
- NAH.

192
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:02,262
- IT'S JUST A CAKE.

193
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,765
- THE FIRST STEP
TO MAKING A CAKE IS,

194
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,701
I HAVE NO [bleep] IDEA.

195
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,169
- OH.

196
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,539
- LET'S JUST DECORATE
THE CAKE FIRST, I FEEL.

197
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,241
- IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT--
- GET THE OTHER LAYER.

198
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,544
- IT'S STUCK.
- STOP.

199
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,211
- IT AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

200
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,881
OKAY, NOW, IT'S GOING.

201
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,850
- OH.
JENNI.

202
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,752
- IT'S FINE.
IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS.

203
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,319
- WHOA.
- ALL YOU'VE GOT TO DO IS ICE--

204
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,456
- AAH!
FIVE SECOND RULE.

205
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:30,257
FIVE SECOND RULE.
- WE NEED A NEW BASE.

206
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,960
- NO, WE'LL FIX IT.
WE'LL JUST STICK IT TOGETHER.

207
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,127
THIS IS LIKE A LAVA CAKE.

208
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:37,665
- WE'LL JUST DECORATE IT.
- OKAY.

209
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,299
- DID YOU THINK ABOUT ANYTHING
FOR YOUR WEDDING YET?

210
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,635
- I DECIDED I WANT TO GET
MARRIED BY NEXT YEAR.

211
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,471
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.

212
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:44,672
- I LOVE THAT.

213
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,106
- USUALLY, IT TAKES A YEAR,
SO, LIKE,

214
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,340
I'VE GOT TO START NOW,
SO I NEED TO START

215
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:50,210
LOOKING AT VENUES,
TRY ON DRESSES.

216
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,546
- WE DIDN'T START PLANNING.
WE'RE NOT GONNA PLAN.

217
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,215
WHAT HAPPENS IF ROGER
GOES BALD IN 20 YEARS?

218
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,717
LIKE, DO I HAVE TO
DEAL WITH THAT?

219
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,085
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU
MARRY THAT PERSON,

220
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,587
YOU'RE WITH THEM FOR LIFE.

221
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,022
- YOU THINK TOO MUCH.
JUST GO WITH THE FLOW.

222
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,158
- YEAH, WELL, I WANT TO GO
SEE A THERAPIST WITH ROGER.

223
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,028
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO
TO A THERAPIST?

224
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,363
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?
- ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS?

225
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:11,999
- I WANT TO DO
COUPLES THERAPY

226
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,167
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
ME AND ROGER

227
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,135
NEED SOMEONE
TO KIND OF MODERATE

228
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:16,504
AND TELL US WHAT TO DO,

229
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,138
UNLESS THE THERAPIST
SAYS THAT HE'S RIGHT.

230
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,107
THEN, I'LL CUT
THE THERAPIST'S [bleep] OFF.

231
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,876
- I COULD BE YOUR THERAPIST.
DO YOU GUYS HAVE SEX?

232
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,778
- LIKE, ONCE A WEEK MAYBE.

233
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,714
- UH, WE HAVE SEX,
LIKE, ONCE A MONTH.

234
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,348
- IS IT 'CAUSE OF LORENZO?

235
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,417
- WELL, EVERY TIME I TRY
AND HAVE SEX WITH HIM,

236
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,185
HE FALLS ASLEEP.

237
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,521
- OH, YEAH.

238
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,822
- I THINK IT'S JUST
NEW PARENT SYNDROME.

239
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:35,889
- YOU'VE HEARD
HOW I'VE HAD SEX.

240
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,290
THAT [bleep] EXHAUSTING.

241
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,593
- IT SOUNDS SO PAINFUL.
I CAN'T.

242
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,162
BIG DINOSAUR [bleep].
- [laughs]

243
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,197
I CAN NEVER BE WITH
ANOTHER MAN AFTER HIM.

244
00:07:44,264 --> 00:07:46,233
- SERIOUSLY.
HEY, I CAN'T TALK.

245
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:50,337
I HAD A BABY, BUT I DID
GET THE EXTRA STITCH.

246
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:54,407
TA-DA!
WE DID A GREAT JOB.

247
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,143
- I FEEL LIKE
WE SCREWED UP.

248
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,645
- MAYBE IF WE HAD
INSTRUCTIONS.

249
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,580
- THE EGYPTIANS
DIDN'T HAVE INSTRUCTIONS

250
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,048
WHEN THEY BUILT THE PYRAMIDS,
BUT THEY--

251
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,616
- YES, THEY [bleep] DID.
- WHO INSTRUCTED THEM?

252
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:06,353
- THE CATS.
- OH, THE CATS. I'M SORRY.

253
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,555
ALL RIGHT.
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

254
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,156
- YEAH, LET'S LEAVE.

255
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,390
- ME AND JENNI
ARE BASICALLY

256
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,592
SNEAKING OUT OF THIS BAKERY
RIGHT NOW

257
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:12,793
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT?

258
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,461
WE DIDN'T REALLY DO
A GOOD JOB.

259
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,999
- WHAT THE--
- [screams]

260
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:21,468
- OH!
[laughs]

261
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:22,936
- I'M BLIND!

262
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,305
- IT WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO BREAK!

263
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,207
- JENNI,
I CAN'T OPEN MY EYES.

264
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,009
WHAT THE [bleep]
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

265
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,177
- I JUST WANTED TO
GET YOU A LITTLE BIT

266
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,344
WITH THE WATER BOTTLE.

267
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:33,380
- I CAN'T [bleep] SEE!

268
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:35,649
BRING ME TO ORTHOPEDICS.

269
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,121
- * REINVENT YOURSELF *

270
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,925
- LET'S GO, GIRLS.
- UHH!

271
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,360
- TODAY, WE ARE GOING TO
HAVE A LITTLE GIRLS' DAY.

272
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,361
[dog barks]

273
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:49,797
OH!

274
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,666
- STOP THE FIGHTING!
[bleep]!

275
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,602
- LORENZO
IS SO MUCH EASIER.

276
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,870
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO GO
TO THE NAIL SALON

277
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,238
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
GOT A "PEDICORE"

278
00:08:58,305 --> 00:08:59,607
IN GOD KNOWS HOW LONG.

279
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:00,708
- "PEDICORE"?

280
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,709
[both laugh]

281
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,210
I TOTALLY HEARD IT.

282
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,612
- I SAID "PEDICORE"?

283
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,913
- I'M JUST GETTING
MY NAILS PAINTED.

284
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,881
- IS IT WEIRD THAT
I'M EXCITED FOR THAT?

285
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,482
- NO, THAT'S
DEFINITELY CUTE.

286
00:09:09,617 --> 00:09:11,018
[dog barks]
- WHOA!

287
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:15,322
UHH!
- STOP IT! SIT! RELAX!

288
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,424
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE 'EM COOPED
UP IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY.

289
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,992
- BUT YOU CAN.

290
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,460
OOH.
- STOP IT.

291
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,962
- ARE YOU GROWLING AT ME?

292
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,296
- WOULD YOU LEAVE LORENZO COOPED
UP IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY?

293
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,698
- LORENZO IS A CHILD.

294
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:25,999
- SO ARE MY BABIES.

295
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,034
[dog growls]
- OOH.

296
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,802
STOP IT.
- STOP IT, NOELLE.

297
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:29,937
- I'M NOT SAYING
I DON'T LOVE 'EM,

298
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:32,405
BUT WE COULD HAVE
LEFT 'EM HOME.

299
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,141
DO YOU TAKE THEM
EVERYWHERE LIKE THAT?

300
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,643
- I MEAN,
I WOULD LIKE TO--

301
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,344
- LIKE, HOW DO YOU
ACCOMPLISH YOUR DAY?

302
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,079
- THEY'RE NOT BAD DOGS.

303
00:09:39,146 --> 00:09:40,781
- THEY JUST NEED
A LITTLE, LIKE--

304
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,650
- DISCIPLINE?
- YEAH.

305
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,284
OH!
[dogs barking]

306
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,687
GIRLS.
GIRLS, KNOCK IT OFF.

307
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:47,988
- STOP IT.
- CUT IT OUT.

308
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:49,256
- I JUST WANT
MY NAILS DONE.

309
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,691
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

310
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:52,926
- WE'RE GOING
IN A NAIL SALON, OKAY?

311
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,962
OH, GOD.
I JUST STEPPED ON ITS PAW.

312
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,798
- OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NO PET ALLOWED.

313
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,232
- HUH?
- NO PET ALLOWED.

314
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,734
- REALLY? NO PETS?
- YEP.

315
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,335
- BUT THEY'RE LIKE BABIES.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

316
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,536
- OH.
- OH, GOD.

317
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,639
SHE TINKLED ON YOUR CARPET
ALREADY.

318
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,041
- "SHE PEED. SHE PEED.
SHE PEED."

319
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,843
I'M, LIKE, "SHUT UP."
"SHE PEED."

320
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,478
YOU COMPLETELY THREW ME
UNDER THE BUS.

321
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,281
YOU'RE AN [bleep], DUDE.

322
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,582
LET'S GO SHOPPING.

323
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:18,686
[dogs barking]
- AAH! STOP IT!

324
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:21,054
GIRLS, GIRLS,
KNOCK IT OFF.

325
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,891
- HI.
- OH.

326
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,393
- HELLO.
- OH, MY GOD, WHAT IS THIS?

327
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,096
YOU DID NOT.
- YEAH.

328
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,564
OH, BELLA, BELLA.
- OH, LORDY LOU.

329
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,866
ARE THEY GONNA [bleep]
ON MY RUG?

330
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,068
both: PROBABLY.
- GREAT.

331
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,770
- I UNDERSTAND
PEOPLE'S CONCERNS,

332
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:39,606
BUT ME BEING ME,
I DON'T CARE.

333
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,008
- WE JUST LIVE IN
JENNI'S WORLD.

334
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,242
EVERYONE LIVES
IN JENNI'S WORLD.

335
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,111
- THANK YOU.
I'M LOCKING THE DOOR.

336
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,779
- YOU BETTER BEHAVE YOURSELF,
MISTER.

337
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,180
- ARE YOU TRYING TO HUMP ME
RIGHT NOW?

338
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:48,581
YOU'RE REALLY TRYING
TO HUMP ME RIGHT NOW?

339
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,484
- WHOA.
- STOP IT. STOP IT.

340
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,554
- OH, LORD.
I THINK HE WAS SODOMIZING HER.

341
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,691
- DIESEL.
- IS THAT PEE?

342
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:59,960
- ARE THESE MINE
OR YOURS?

343
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,795
- IS THAT PEE ON MY FLOOR?

344
00:11:01,862 --> 00:11:04,164
- I'LL PAY
FOR STANLEY STEAMER.

345
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:07,935
- THIS LADY IS NEVER GONNA
LET US INTO HER STORE ANYMORE,

346
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,436
AND THAT SUCKS BECAUSE SHE HAS
REALLY NICE STUFF,

347
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,104
SO THANKS, DOGS.

348
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,572
I DON'T LIKE SHOPPING
WITH THEM.

349
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,275
[dogs barking]
- AAH! STOP IT!

350
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:16,643
- [barks]
- STOP.

351
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:17,745
[dogs barking]

352
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,780
- HELLO, HELLO.
- HELLO.

353
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,581
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

354
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,784
- MAY WE SIT AND POSSIBLY GET
FOOD AND DRINK?

355
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,118
- YEAH.

356
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,120
- UH, I CAN DO
THE DRINKS AND STUFF,

357
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,589
AND THEN I HAVE TO ASK YOU TO
SIT OUTSIDE WITH THEM.

358
00:11:29,656 --> 00:11:31,792
CAN'T HAVE DOGS IN.
- THAT'S NICE.

359
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,193
- DISCRIMINATION.

360
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,862
I FEEL, LIKE, SEGREGATED.

361
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:36,764
- WHERE ARE YOU LEARNING
THESE WORDS?

362
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,032
- I'M TELLING YOU, LIKE,
MY BRAIN IS JUST EXPANDING.

363
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:43,336
WHEN I GET OLDER, I JUST FEEL
MORE WISER AND SMARTER.

364
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,806
- ARE YOU BLIND?
- WHY'D YOU ASK IF I WAS BLIND?

365
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,507
- BLIND PEOPLE NEED DOGS.

366
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:48,942
MAYBE IF THEY WERE
SERVICE DOGS,

367
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,944
WE'D LET YOU HANG OUT
TILL WE CLOSE, BUT...

368
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:52,846
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T THINK OF THIS BEFORE.

369
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,916
I'LL GET MY DOG SERVICED
EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT BLIND,

370
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:57,117
BUT I'LL SAY I'M BLIND.

371
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,651
I WANT TO GET YOU SERVICED.

372
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,955
ALL I NEED IS SOME
REALLY DARK, HUGE SUNGLASSES,

373
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,991
A WHITE STICK,
AND JUST BUMP INTO THINGS--

374
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,060
WHICH I BUMP INTO THINGS
HALF THE TIME ANYWAYS.

375
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,529
I'M EXCITED FOR YOU
TO PLAN YOUR WEDDING.

376
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,498
- [gasps]
ME TOO.

377
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,632
- I'M EXCITED FOR YOU
TO TRY ON WEDDING DRESSES,

378
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:13,867
AND I'LL TRY ONE ON.

379
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,936
- OKAY.

380
00:12:16,003 --> 00:12:18,005
- HEY, MAYBE I'LL GET THE ITCH
WHEN I START PLANNING WITH YOU.

381
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,439
- YOU WILL.

382
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:21,241
ONCE YOU SEE ME IN THAT DRESS
WALKING DOWN,

383
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,210
YOU'LL BE, LIKE,
"I WANT MY DAY NOW."

384
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:24,577
- AND I WANT TO SEE
HOW HOT I WOULD LOOK

385
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:26,579
IF I DECIDE TO GET MARRIED,
'CAUSE I'M VAIN.

386
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,381
- WHAT IS VAIN?
- SERIOUSLY?

387
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:29,850
- YES.
- VAIN. YOU'RE VAIN.

388
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:32,920
YOU ARE THE EPITOME OF VAIN.
- OKAY.

389
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,488
VAIN MEANS CONCEITED,
RIGHT?

390
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,825
THAT'S YOU TOO, BITCH.
PLEASE.

391
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,961
ARE YOU READY TO GET GOING?
- YEAH, IF YOU ARE.

392
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:43,396
- I'M EXHAUSTED,
JUST WATCHING THESE KIDS.

393
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,598
THIS IS NOT HOW I
IMAGINED THE DAY TO BE.

394
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:48,001
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT THE DOGS WERE COMING.

395
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,569
LIKE, SICK GIRLS' DAY.

396
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,338
[dogs barking]
- WHOA!

397
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,374
- OH, MY GOD.
I'M DRUGGING YOU ALL.

398
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:57,845
- * SEEKING OUT PASSION... *

399
00:12:57,878 --> 00:13:00,513
[dogs barking]

400
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,152
- WHEN IT COMES TO MARRIAGE,
LIKE, I'M VERY APPREHENSIVE,

401
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:08,856
AND CLEARLY, ME AND ROGER ARE
NOT THE BEST AT COMPROMISING

402
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,925
AND GETTING THROUGH THINGS,
SO RIGHT NOW

403
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:14,061
I JUST WANT TO GET MY
RELATIONSHIP BACK ON TRACK.

404
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,863
- HI.
RICH PORESKY.

405
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:18,431
- HI, I AM INTERESTED
IN COUPLES COUNSELING.

406
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:21,869
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'RE
AVAILABLE SOON?

407
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,604
- HOW WOULD TOMORROW BE,
AROUND 5:00?

408
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:27,274
- THAT'S PERFECT, ACTUALLY.
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET YOU.

409
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,508
- BYE-BYE.

410
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,178
- DIESEL, MOMMY
FOUND A THERAPIST.

411
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:33,947
SOUNDS NICE.
THINK HE CAN FIX YOU?

412
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,649
GOOD TALK, DIESEL.

413
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:38,886
NOW, THE HARD PART
IS TO TELL ROGER

414
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,121
THAT I ALREADY MADE AN
APPOINTMENT WITH A THERAPIST.

415
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,094
ARE YOU DONE? NO?
ARE YOU DONE?

416
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,897
ROGER DOESN'T HAVE
FAITH IN ANYTHING.

417
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:50,998
LET'S GO
TO THE LIVING ROOM.

418
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,065
- LIVING ROOM?
WHAT IS THIS?

419
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,633
IMPORTANT TALKS
OR SOMETHING?

420
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,536
- SO, I'M VERY AFRAID THAT
WHEN I BRING UP THE THERAPIST,

421
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,206
ROGER IS GONNA SAY, "NOBODY
CAN FIX US BUT OURSELVES.

422
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,408
BUH, BUH, BUH. THAT'S NOT...
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."

423
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:04,244
AND IT'S JUST GONNA BE A HUGE
HEADACHE AND A FIGHT,

424
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:05,913
AND I AM NOT
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT.

425
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:06,914
[sighs]

426
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,148
I CALLED A FEW THERAPISTS

427
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:10,283
AND I MADE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR TOMORROW.

428
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,420
- THERAPISTS AS FAR AS--

429
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:16,556
- COUPLES COUNSELING.
- [sighs]

430
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:20,093
YOU MEAN THE THING PEOPLE DO
RIGHT BEFORE THEY GET A DIVORCE?

431
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:26,499
- * SHE HAS BEEN WAITING
FOR FAR TOO LONG *

432
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,968
- I CALLED A FEW THERAPISTS

433
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:30,303
AND I MADE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR TOMORROW.

434
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,173
- YOU MEAN THE THING PEOPLE DO
RIGHT BEFORE THEY GET A DIVORCE?

435
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,142
- MAYBE THEY
SAVE THE MARRIAGE.

436
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,176
- ARE WE THAT BAD?

437
00:14:36,243 --> 00:14:37,945
- I DON'T FIND THAT YOU--

438
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,812
I THINK YOU HAVE,
LIKE, A STIGMA AGAINST IT.

439
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,814
- IT TAKES A LONG TIME
TO GET TO KNOW SOMEBODY,

440
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,985
SO WHAT, DO WE GO FOR,
YOU KNOW, $10,000 WORTH,

441
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:46,419
AND THEN THEY GET TO KNOW US
ENOUGH TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT?

442
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,055
YOU KNOW,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS TO ME.

443
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,857
IT'S A GLORIFIED,
OVERPAID MODERATOR.

444
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,226
"DESCRIBE YOUR LIFE TO ME
AND, YOU KNOW,

445
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,628
BUTTERFLIES AND RAINBOWS."

446
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:57,965
I'M NEVER GONNA BE THE GUY
THAT GOES TO THERAPY

447
00:14:57,998 --> 00:14:59,299
AND HAS A BREAKDOWN
AND CRIES IN THE CORNER,

448
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:00,633
LIKE, "I MISS MY MOMMY."

449
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,969
IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

450
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:04,537
- HE MISSES HIS MOM.
- YEAH.

451
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,308
- WELL, ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT WE'RE GOING

452
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,510
OR ARE YOU ASKING ME
MY TAKE ON IT?

453
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,345
- WELL, I ALREADY MADE
THE APPOINTMENT.

454
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,447
- OH, SO I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
I'M JUST GOING?

455
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,984
- MM-HMM.

456
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:19,652
- AM I EXCITED ABOUT IT?
NO.

457
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,189
- [sighs]

458
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,058
- DO YOU THINK THIS GUY
CAN HELP US?

459
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:28,128
IT CAN'T HURT RIGHT?
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

460
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:31,999
ALL RIGHT, BABE, IF YOU
WANT TO GO, I'LL GO.

461
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,003
- THANK YOU.

462
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,004
- POW!
- AAH!

463
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,105
JESUS.

464
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:40,907
[both laugh]

465
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,909
I HAVE A BOOGER.

466
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:47,314
- AWESOME. MAYBE YOU
SHOULD TELL HIM THAT.

467
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,350
- YOU ARE JUST
POSITIVE PETE OVER THERE.

468
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,019
- [laughs]

469
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,520
- * NEVER STOP FOR NO ONE *

470
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,456
* THAT'S THE WAY
I'M GROWING *

471
00:15:56,523 --> 00:16:00,160
* JUST KEEP IT COMING *

472
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:03,430
- OW! I'M SORE.
BUT DON'T STOP THOUGH.

473
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,864
CAN I JUST HAVE ONE KISS?

474
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,399
- OH, GOD.

475
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,368
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE READY TO
HAVE SEX OR SOMETHING.

476
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,836
- [laughs]
EW!

477
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,671
YOUR MOM SAID "SEX."
- SEX.

478
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:14,341
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- RUBBING HER LEGS, OBVIOUSLY.

479
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,876
- OH, GOD.
- YOU WEIRDO.

480
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,178
- BYE.

481
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,480
I LOVE YOUR MOM,
BUT THIS IS WHY

482
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:21,648
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

483
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:22,882
- [sighs]

484
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:23,850
YEAH, I'M KIND OF AFRAID
TO TELL MY MOM

485
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,851
THAT WE'RE LEAVING HER.

486
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:25,818
SHE'S GONNA BE SAD.

487
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,054
- SHE'S GONNA FREAK OUT.

488
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,355
SO, YOU SAY,
"HEY, MOM, LISTEN.

489
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,822
WE'VE GOT TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING."

490
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:32,359
THEN, AUTOMATICALLY,
SHE'LL THINK I'M PREGNANT.

491
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:33,593
- SHE'S GONNA ASK TO COME.

492
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,694
- SHE CAN'T, LIKE,
MOVE IN WITH US

493
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:35,862
'CAUSE THAT'S WHY
WE'RE MOVING OUT.

494
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,330
- SO YOU'RE
TELLING HER FIRST?

495
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,232
- NO.
- I'M NOT TELLING HER.

496
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,967
- JIONNI, PLEASE TELL HER.
I'M NOT KIDDING.

497
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,335
- YOU'RE TELLING HER,
NOT ME.

498
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,603
- I'M NOT TELLING HER.
SHE'S YOUR MOTHER.

499
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,073
- YOU'RE GONNA TELL HER.
- YOU'RE NERVOUS.

500
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,308
ARE YOU'RE PRAYING?
- MY MOM DOESN'T YELL.

501
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,078
- SHE'S GONNA BE VERY SAD.
- YOU TELL HER.

502
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:52,279
- NO!

503
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,680
- HI.
- SHH.

504
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:54,881
- YOU TELL HER.
YOU TELL HER. YOU TELL HER.

505
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,149
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER.
YOU TELL HER.

506
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,084
YOU TELL HER.
YOU TELL HER. YOU TELL HER.

507
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,685
- HEY, GUYS.

508
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,153
both: HEY.
- I'M RUNNING TO THE STORE.

509
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,555
YOU GUYS NEED ANYTHING?
DIAPERS, FORMULA?

510
00:17:02,622 --> 00:17:05,292
- NO.

511
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,627
- WHAT?

512
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,262
- JIONNI HAS SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

513
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,298
JIONNI.

514
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,632
- WHY ARE YOU SO SERIOUS?

515
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,369
- JIONNI,
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

516
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:19,106
- WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN
TO THE SHORE FOR THE SUMMER.

517
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:20,107
- IS THIS A JOKE?

518
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,478
- THERE'S MORE SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW
ON THE WAY...

519
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,814
- AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

520
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,183
- WE HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

521
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,120
WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN TO
THE SHORE FOR THE SUMMER.

522
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,687
- IS THIS A JOKE?

523
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,757
YOU'RE GOING DOWN TO THE SHORE
FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER?

524
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,227
- WE GOT A HOUSE.
LIKE, A NICE HOUSE.

525
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:42,129
- FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER?
- YEAH.

526
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,031
- I'LL PUT IN FOR
A VACATION TOMORROW.

527
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:46,366
- [bleep].

528
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:49,769
- OH, MY GOD.
I LOVE YOU, BUT BACK AWAY.

529
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,238
- I COULD COME DOWN,
RIGHT?

530
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:52,705
- TO VISIT, NICOLE SAID.
- YEAH.

531
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,708
- YOU SAID "VISIT"?
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

532
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,477
- SHE DID?
- HE--NO.

533
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,312
YOU COULD COME
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

534
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,447
- I'VE GOT TO CUT THE CORD
SOMEHOW, MA.

535
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,914
- THIS ISN'T CUTTING
THE CORD.

536
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,183
I'M COMING OVER EVERY DAY.

537
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,218
I'M ACTUALLY THINKING
OF MOVING IN.

538
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,419
- OH, [bleep]

539
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,854
- IT'S LIKE,
YOU CAN COME VISIT,

540
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,055
BUT THIS IS OUR PLACE.

541
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,323
- THE KEY WORD
IN THERE--VISIT.

542
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,159
- MM-HMM.
- YOU CAN COME VISIT.

543
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:14,727
- YOU'RE LEAVING ME
FOR THE WHOLE SUMMER?

544
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:16,563
- UH-HUH.
IT'S REALLY NICE.

545
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,865
IT'S ON THE BAY.
LORENZO HAS HIS OWN ROOM.

546
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,867
WE CAN HAVE SUNDAY DINNERS.
- LORENZO IS GOING TOO?

547
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,469
- JANIS IS NOT HAPPY
THAT WE'RE LEAVING.

548
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,770
- NO WAY.

549
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,871
KITCHEN WITH MY DAD
THE WHOLE TIME?

550
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,873
- YEAH!
- STARTING AT EACH OTHER.

551
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,075
- OH, NO.
- THAT'S AWKWARD.

552
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:32,745
- YEAH. I FEEL BAD, BUT...
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

553
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:34,347
- YOU'VE GOTTA PACK.
YOU KNOW WHAT TO PACK?

554
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:35,515
- YEAH, WE HAVE A LOT
OF PACKING TO DO.

555
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:37,049
- YEAH, WE'RE GONNA START
PACKING.

556
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:38,551
- THE WHOLE SUMMER?
FOR REAL?

557
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:42,955
- YEAH.
- OH, MY LORD.

558
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,224
- LOVE YOU.

559
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,793
- OH, MY GOD.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

560
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:47,927
YEAH, LORENZO IS
STAYING WITH ME.

561
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,197
- NO.

562
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:51,864
- LET'S GET DONE PACKING.

563
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,466
- THAT WENT GOOD.

564
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,602
- GOOD JOB.

565
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:59,572
- I GOT BOXES FOR US
AND BUBBLE WRAP.

566
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,873
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH BUBBLE WRAP?

567
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,043
- POP THE BUBBLES.
- [laughs]

568
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,445
- I FEEL LIKE THIS SUMMER
AS A FAMILY,

569
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:06,946
WE'RE GONNA BE GREAT.

570
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:10,617
WE'RE GONNA GROW MORE
AS PARENTS AND AS A COUPLE.

571
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,452
THIS COULD BE, LIKE,
A HOUSE.

572
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,288
WE SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE FORT
FOR LORENZO.

573
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,889
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A MILLION MEMORIES.

574
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:19,759
THIS IS JUST THE START
TO OUR FAMILY TRADITION,

575
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:23,363
SO I HAVE, YOU KNOW,
HIGH HOPES FOR THE SUMMER.

576
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,398
WE COULD CUT OUT, LIKE,
A LITTLE WINDOW,

577
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,367
AND IT COULD BE, LIKE,
LORENZO'S LITTLE HOUSE.

578
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:28,735
- ALL RIGHT. LET ME SEE.
- NO.

579
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,371
- JUST GO IN.
- THERE'S A GHOST IN HERE.

580
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,440
20 BUCKS
IF YOU CAN PICK ME UP.

581
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,007
- OKAY. HOLD ON.

582
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,510
- 20 BUCKS
IF YOU CAN PICK ME UP.

583
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,346
[screams]

584
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,314
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

585
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:46,253
- JIONNI?

586
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,054
JIONNI!

587
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,956
[grunts]

588
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,259
THIS IS SO RUDE.

589
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,860
JIONNI!

590
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,728
BABE!

591
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:00,267
- THIS IS THE MOMENT WE'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR FOREVER.

592
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,801
- OH, MY GOD.
- WELCOME HOME.

593
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,604
I LOST MY BOOBS.
- GET SOME BOLT-ONS LIKE JENNI.

594
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:06,239
OFF TO THERAPY WE GO.

595
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,007
I KNOW THAT I NEED TO
WORK ON ROMANCE.

596
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,442
HONEY, WAKE UP, WAKE UP!
- THIS IS NOT ROMANCE.

597
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:10,877
THIS IS MOLESTATION.

598
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,479
- BUT I WOULD LIKE TO PULL
JENNI'S SKIRT DOWN

599
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,580
AND RAVAGE HER.

600
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,715
- SO, SHE'S A SEXY LADY?
- UGH!

601
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,250
- IT'S NICE TO BE BACK
AT THE SHORE.

602
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,551
- IT'S, LIKE,
THE NEW BOOK.

603
00:20:18,618 --> 00:20:19,686
IT'S NOT EVEN A NEW CHAPTER.

604
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:20,887
IT'S A NEW BOOK.
- YEAH.

605
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,221
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S ALL DIVE IN.

606
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,490
- WHOA!
- AAH!

607
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,525
- DON'T, DON'T!
STOP, STOP, STOP, PLEASE!
