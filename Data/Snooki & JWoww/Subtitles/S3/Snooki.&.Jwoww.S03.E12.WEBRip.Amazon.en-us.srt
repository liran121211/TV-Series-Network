00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:34,455
- FANTASTIC.

00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,238
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT REALLY ME.

AND WHAT I'VE COME TO

I DON'T NECESSARILY

WANT HIM TO BE MORE ROMANTIC,

00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,811
I WANT HIM TO JUST PAY ATTENTION
TO ME,

AND YOU ACCEPT MINE.

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,609
BUT I WILL FOR MY GODSON.

174
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:17,445
HOW'S THAT?
- YEAH.

175
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,747
ALL RIGHT, BLOW ME UP.

176
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,082
[fan whirring]

177
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:27,120
EW!
[laughter]

178
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,089
OH, MY GOD, I'M GONNA BE
A FAT CLOWN.

179
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,624
- [honks]

180
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:32,092
- WHY DO I GOT TO BE
THE FAT CLOWN?

181
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,762
IT'S GOT TO BE
THE SHORT, FAT ONE.

182
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,364
- A [bleep] MULLET?
[both chuckling]

183
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,101
- OH, MY GOD.
- SEE THAT, YOU ARE SO--

184
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,370
I FEEL A DRAFT BACK HERE.
- YOU LOOK LIKE A BOY.

185
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:44,938
- I WOULD NEVER BE A CLOWN
AS A JOB.

186
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,674
- NO.
- THEY'RE WEIRD.

187
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,476
- I'M JUST DOING THIS
FOR MY SON.

188
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,043
- YEAH.
- AND EVEN IF I'M GOOD AT IT--

189
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,344
- I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].
- WHO THE [bleep] WANTS

190
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,680
TO BE A CLOWN?
- [bleep], NO.

191
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,614
I'M TOO MUCH OF A BITCH
TO BE A CLOWN.

192
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:54,615
- NAH, I'D RATHER BE PRETTY.

193
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:58,285
[horn squeaking]

194
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,487
WE SHOULD TWERK AS CLOWNS.

195
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:02,756
[horn squeaking]
[laughter]

196
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,593
- I THINK NICOLE IS
THE FIRST ONE TO INVENT

197
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,194
THE CLOWN TWERK.

198
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:10,097
[horns squeaking]

199
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:14,267
HOLD ON.
[horns squeaking]

200
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,304
[laughs]
- OH, MY GOD.

201
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:19,306
[horns squeaking]
WHAT THE F--

202
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,374
WHAT ARE THESE
TWO GOOFBALLS DOING?

203
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:25,245
- HI, LORENZO!
- HI!

204
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:28,516
- [laughs]
[horn squeaking]

205
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:29,917
- HERE WE GO!

206
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:35,756
[horn squeaking]

207
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:37,625
I FEEL LIKE IT'S A MYTH THAT
BABIES ARE SCARED OF CLOWNS.

208
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,327
I THINK LORENZO IS GOING TO
BE FINE WITH THE CLOWNS.

209
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,663
- MY SON'S NOT VERY ENTERTAINED,
CLOWNS.

210
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,735
[horns squeaking]

211
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,938
OH, MY--CAN I HAVE
MY MONEY BACK?

212
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,339
THEY LOOK LIKE A BUNCH
OF WHACKADOOS,

213
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:54,708
DANCING LIKE GOOFBALLS,
HONKING THE HORN.

214
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,276
JENNI'S RHYTHM IS WAY OFF.

215
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,878
NICOLE AT LEAST
LOOKS LIKE A CUTE CLOWN.

216
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,279
JENNI IS JUST SCARING
THE [bleep] OUT OF EVERYBODY.

217
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:01,314
I'M GETTING SCARED OF JENNI.

218
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,850
- QUICK, GRAB MY NOSE.

219
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,718
YOU GOT MY NOSE!

220
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,687
- [cries]
- UH-OH.

221
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:08,556
- OH, YOU'RE SCARING HIM.
- AW.

222
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,357
- YOU'RE SCARING HIM!
- [cries]

223
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,325
- AW!
- IT'S THE MULLET!

224
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,460
- CLOWN TRICK'S OVER.
- DOM, IT'S ME!

225
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,128
- CLOWNS, THE PARTY'S OVER.

226
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:16,263
- IT'S ME, IT'S ME, IT'S OKAY.
- IT'S THE MULLET.

227
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,430
- [cries]
- JENNI, TAKE 'EM OFF.

228
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:19,066
- CLOWN, THE PARTY'S OVER.
GET OUT!

229
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:20,433
[laughter]
GET OUT.

230
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:22,302
- WE'RE SORRY.
- IT'S OKAY.

231
00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:23,403
COME ON.
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

232
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,605
- I JUST LET HIM--

233
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:25,939
- COME ON.
- HE GRABBED THE WIG.

234
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,107
- GET OUT, CLOWN PARTY IS OVER.
- YOU SCARED HIM!

235
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,476
- [laughs] I DIDN'T DO ANY--
AAH!

236
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,679
[horn squeaking]
- CHEAP-ASS CLOWNS.

237
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,781
WE'LL STICK TO PIRATES.

238
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:34,982
- LET'S GO.

239
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,050
- WALK OF SHAME?
- I'M ASHAMED.

240
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:39,820
I'M ASHAMED OF MYSELF.
[whistle, horn honk]

241
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:43,591
- * THE ONLY THING THAT
WE CHANGED IS OUR CLOTHES *

242
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:44,792
- * BAH BAH BAH *

243
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,495
- FORK ME.
- EW.

244
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:49,963
[laughs] SORRY.
- OOH.

245
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,599
- THERE'S SOME ONIONS
IN THE SALAD.

246
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,233
- HOW'D YOU KNOW
I WANTED ONIONS?

247
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,402
- 'CAUSE YOU ALWAYS PUT ONIONS
ON YOUR BURGER, AND PICKLE.

248
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,804
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
YOU KNOW ME?

249
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,005
- YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

250
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59,607
- WHAT'S MY FAVORITE NUMBER?
- THREE.

251
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,241
- [scoffs] MY GOD, FORGET IT.
- FIVE?

252
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:02,610
IT'S THREE OR FIVE.

253
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,711
IT'S FIVE.
- YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED,

254
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,511
YOU DON'T KNOW
MY FAVORITE NUMBER.

255
00:09:04,612 --> 00:09:05,813
- IT'S FIVE!

256
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,682
- WHAT'S MY FAVORITE COLOR?
- BLUE.

257
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,250
- SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO ASK
THE AUDIENCE ON THAT ONE?

258
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,284
- [laughs]

259
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,986
- [coos]

260
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,487
- WHAT'S MY FAVORITE ANIMAL?

261
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:17,257
- WHEN DID YOU TELL ME
YOU HAD A FAVORITE ANIMAL?

262
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,660
- YOU SHOULD JUST KNOW.
- LIZARD.

263
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:20,861
- A FRICKIN' LIZARD?

264
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,062
- [laughs]
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

265
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,797
- WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE ANIMAL?

266
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:26,033
LOOK, WE'RE GETTING TO KNOW
EACH OTHER. [laughs]

267
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,467
- OH, NOW WE'RE GETTING TO KNOW
EACH OTHER?

268
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,769
- [laughs]
- WE MAY HAVE TO POSTPONE

269
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:30,638
THIS WEDDING.
- NO, NO!

270
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,042
[geese honking]

271
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,644
- BABE, IT'S LORENZO'S BIRTHDAY.

272
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,412
IT'S LORENZO'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

273
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,650
OH, YOUR BREATH STINKS.

274
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,184
- NO, IT DOESN'T!
- GO BRUSH YOUR TEETH.

275
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,819
COME ON, IT'S LORENZO'S--
LET'S GO WAKE LORENZO UP.

276
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:49,289
- OKAY.
TODAY IS LORENZO'S BIRTHDAY!

277
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,725
AND I'M SO EXCITED
MY BABY IS TURNING ONE.

278
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,460
I JUST HAVE ALL THESE EMOTIONS.

279
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,963
I'M NERVOUS, I'M SAD,
I'M ANXIOUS.

280
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,765
I MEAN, IT'S CRAZY.

281
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,432
- [laughs] DA-DA.

282
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,602

00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:15,048
- MY BABY'S ONE.

287
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,685
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT MY BABY
IS TURNING ONE YEARS OLD.

288
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,787
EVERYTHING JUST WENT BY
SO QUICKLY.

289
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,288
I FEEL LIKE I JUST HAD HIM.

290
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,857
THIS IS IT, LORENZO.
YOU'RE HURTING ME.

291
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:26,259
- NICOLE, YOU'RE A PRO.
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH!

292
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,828
- [grunts]
- YAY!

293
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:28,996
- [laughs]

294
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:31,264
- A BOY, HEY!
- I'M JUST HAPPY.

295
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,933
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED A KID.

296
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,603
AND HE'S HERE, AND HE'S HEALTHY,
AND HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

297
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,473
[kisses]
MY LITTLE BOY.

298
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,710
- [coos]
- YOU'RE ONE TODAY.

299
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,011
- OH, YOU'RE SO BIG.

300
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:45,078
- I LOVE MY FAMILY.
- OH, MY GOD.

301
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:50,483
[rock music]

302
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,385
- WE DON'T HAVE A BABY ANYMORE.

303
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:54,421
- WHAT?
- WE HAVE A TODDLER.

304
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,489
- OH.

305
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:57,858
WHAT DO WE HAVE--
WE HAVE A LOT TO DO, NO?

306
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,960
WE GOT TO SET UP
THE PIRATE PLACE.

307
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:01,628
WHAT DO WE GOT LEFT?
PIN THE PAT...

308
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,997
- PIN THE PATCH ON A PIRATE.
- ON A PIRATE, RIGHT.

309
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,598
YOU WANT TO TRY
TO DRAW SOME PIRATES?

310
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,300
- YEAH, LET'S--LET'S DO
PIN THE PATCH ON THE PIRATE.

311
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,836
WHAT'S OUR NEXT THING?

312
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:10,738
- NICOLE AND I ARE BOTH GONNA
DRESS LIKE PIRATES,

313
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:14,742
SO ALL THE KIDS COULD PIN
THE PATCH ON 'EM.

314
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,911
- YOU THINK OTHER PARENTS DO
THIS FOR THEIR FIRST BIRTHDAY?

315
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:20,247
- UM, THEY DEFINITELY
GO ALL OUT,

316
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,315
BUT ACTUALLY DO IT THEMSELVES?

317
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,918
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

318
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,925
WHATCHA THINKING?

319
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:36,163
- THAT EVERYTHING IS JUST
FOR LORENZO NOW.

320
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,631
IT'S NOT ABOUT US ANYMORE,
CUPCAKE.

321
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,567
- WELL, I'M FINE WITH THAT.

322
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,836
ALL ABOUT LORENZO NOW.

323
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:46,306
MY BABY.
I DO EVERYTHING FOR HIM.

324
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,108
- IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER WHAT
WE WANT ANYMORE.

325
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,276
- NOPE.

326
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,545
- TIMES HAVE CHANGED.
- AGREED.

327
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,148
- FOR THE BOTH OF US.
- I LOVE IT.

328
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,018
I LOVE BEING A MOM.
- I'M SO PROUD OF NICOLE.

329
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,520
SHE IS AN UNBELIEVABLE MOTHER.

330
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,322
I-I CAN'T BE ANY PROUDER,
AND I CAN'T BE ANY HAPPIER.

331
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,491
- [laughs]
THAT WAS SO SWEET.

332
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,794
THIS IS MOMMY'S.
- YOU GO ON THAT SIDE.

333
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:07,995
- NO.
- SEE WHO HE GOES TO.

334
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,596
- THIS IS MOMMY'S,
THAT'S DADDY'S.

335
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:11,231
- LORENZO, WHOSE DO YOU WANT
FOR PIN THE PATCH ON THE PIRATE?

336
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,565
- WHOSE DO YOU LIKE?

337
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:13,700
- MINE OR MOMMY'S?
- WHOSE DO YOU LIKE?

338
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:14,835
LORENZO, LORENZO,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING!

339
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,036
- MINE OR MOMMY'S?
MINE OR MOMMY'S?

340
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,137
[both shouting, laughing]
- HI, BIG MAN.

341
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,272
COME HERE, COME HERE.
[laughter]

342
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,608
HERE! LORENZO, LOOK! WHEE!
- LORENZO, LORENZO.

343
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,010
WHO'S YOUR M--YOU CAN TOUCH IT.
- PIN THE PATCH.

344
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,544
- BACK UP.
- PIN THE PATCH ON THE PIRATE.

345
00:12:24,611 --> 00:12:25,946
NO, LORENZO, LORENZO, LORENZO!
- [indistinct]

346
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:29,016
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
- COME ON, COME ON, YES!

347
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,351
YES!
YES!

348
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,719
- YOU DON'T LIKE MOMMY'S?

349
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,454
OF COURSE HE GOES
TO DADDY'S PIRATE,

350
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,556
BECAUSE LORENZO FAVORS JIONNI
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

351
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,392
SO I KNEW HE WAS GONNA WIN,
BUT I MEAN, THAT'S CHEATING.

352
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,662
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

353
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,331
MY PIRATE'S BETTER.

354
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:45,732
- * ONE, TWO, THREE *

355
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,102
* OH, CAN'T YOU SEE
THAT I NEED YOU? *

356
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,271
- I'M GONNA BE
AN ENGLISH PIRATE.

357
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:54,307
THIS IS FOR YOU.
- AH.

358
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,476
SO, TODAY IS LORENZO'S
FIRST BIRTHDAY,

359
00:12:56,543 --> 00:12:57,577
AND IT'S TIME TO GET READY

360
00:12:57,644 --> 00:13:00,981
FOR THE PIRATE PARTY.
ARR!

361
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:04,717
THIS ISN'T GONNA FIT,
I DON'T THINK. [grunts]

362
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,854
PULL DOWN ON THE BOTTOM.

363
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,859
- BIG BOY PROBLEMS.

364
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:14,627
- [sighs]

365
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:17,064
THIS IS LIKE SKINTIGHT.
- I'M ACTUALLY SUPER EXCITED

366
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,698
TO SEE ROGER IN
HIS PIRATE OUTFIT,

367
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,934
BECAUSE THIS SUMMER I HAVE
NOTICED HE HAS LOOKED HOT

368
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,435
IN COSTUME...
- OOH.

369
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,537
- BETWEEN A COWBOY, AND A CHEF,

370
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:27,474
NOW A PIRATE.
I'M TOTALLY INTO IT.

371
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,276
- YET NONE OF THOSE COSTUMES
WORKED.

372
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,277
- SHUT UP!

373
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:34,747
- WOW!

374
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:37,184
- I DON'T LOOK LIKE A PIRATE.
- YEAH, YOU DO.

375
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,787
- [fusses]
- YOU LOOK SEXY!

376
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:42,489
- MY PIRATE PANTS
ARE WAY TOO TIGHT.

377
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,524
I'M JUST A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE,
BUT I GOT TO DO IT

378
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:45,959
FOR LORENZO.
I GOT TO TAKE ONE FOR THE TEAM.

379
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,560
MY WEINER STICKS OUT TOO MUCH.

380
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:48,761
- I KNOW.

381
00:13:48,896 --> 00:13:49,897
- MY PANTS COULD BE
ON BACKWARDS.

382
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,331
- YOU GOT A CAMEL TOE.

383
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:53,666
- I LOOK LIKE A [bleep] JABRONI.

384
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:56,736
- JIONNI, WRAP THE THING AROUND
YOUR PIECHE.

385
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,907
MY SCAROL IS HANGING OUT.
I LOOK [bleep] HORRIBLE.

386
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,408
I NEED BIGGER PANTS.

387
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:03,944
I LOOK LIKE A GIRL.
- NO, YOU DON'T!

388
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:04,945
- YES, I DO.

389
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,546
- BABE.

390
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,248
- I LOOK NOTHING LIKE A PIRATE.

391
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:10,050
- LET'S GO, YOU SWASHBUCKLER.

392
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,052
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
BUT IT SOUNDS SEXY.

393
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:13,686
- SHIVER ME TIMBERS!

394
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:17,124
- * I GOT A KISS
AND YOU GOT OLDER *

395
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,426
- OH!
THIS IS [bleep] AWESOME.

396
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,727
IT'S GONNA BE SO FUN.

397
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,931
LOOK AT THE BOUNCE HOUSE!

398
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,332
SO WE GET TO PIRATE ADVENTURES,

399
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,599
AND THERE'S A PIRATE SHIP,

400
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,701
THERE'S PIRATE COSTUMES,
THERE'S GAMES,

401
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:30,938
AND I FEEL LIKE THE KIDS
ARE GONNA LOVE IT.

402
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,673
- * YO, YO, ROCK AND ROLL *

403
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,443
- YOU READY TO PARTY?
WHOO!

404
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,311
DID YOU PUT THE ARMY DUDES
IN THERE?

405
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,813
- YEAH.
- SO ME AND JIONNI NEED

406
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,449
TO SET UP THE GAMES
THAT WE MADE.

407
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:45,685
OUR TREASURE HUNT, OUR PIN
THE PATCH ON THE PIRATE GAME,

408
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,754
AND NOW WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR
OUR GUESTS TO GET THERE.

409
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,756
- HI, GUYS!
- AHOY!

410
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,124

[laughter]

411
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,593

00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,962

413
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:55,963

I LOVE THIS PARTY.
IT'S SO CUTE.

418
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:04,571
IT'S LIKE THE PERFECT
ONE-YEAR-OLD'S PARTY.

419
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,107
- SHIVER ME TIMBERS.

420
00:15:07,174 --> 00:15:09,709
[upbeat music]
[indistinct chattering]

421
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:12,045
- SO ALL OF OUR GUESTS BEGIN

422
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,114
AND JIONNI'S SIBLINGS COME
WITH ALL

00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,316
THEIR KIDS, AND THEIR WIVES,

SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND.

428
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:28,728
PUT THIS PATCH ON
THE PIRATE'S EYE.

429
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:31,131
HO-HO!

434
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,807

00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,675

00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:43,910
AND ON EACH OTHER'S FINGERS,

437
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:44,911
LIKE, THEY WANT THAT CHOCOLATE.

438
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,246
- GOOD JOB, GUYS.

439
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:48,181
- I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA LOSE
AN ANKLE.

440
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:52,285
- EVERYBODY GET TO

00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,723

473
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,427
[indistinct chatter]

[cheers and applause]

478
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:25,745
- MY BABY'S NOT A BABY ANYMORE.
LORENZO DEFINITELY GREW UP.

479
00:17:25,812 --> 00:17:28,381
LIKE, HE CAME TO THE SHORE
A BABY,

480
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:32,219
AND HE IS LEAVING A TODDLER.

481
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:35,255
IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN CRY.

482
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:38,591
[all awwing]

483
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,127
I'M SO SAD.

484
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,794
HE'S NOT A BABY ANYMORE.

485
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,197
- HE'S STILL YOUR BABY.
- HE'S A BABY.

486
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:46,833
- JIONNI SAID HE'S GONNA GO
TO KARMA AND GET GIRLS.

487
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,301
[laughter]

488
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:49,869
SO, THE PARTY WAS
A HUGE SUCCESS.

489
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,438
ALL THE KIDS HAD SUCH
A GOOD TIME.

490
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,406
THE PARENTS LOVED IT,
THE FAMILY LOVED IT.

491
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:56,309
- YOUR BIRTHDAY IS THE PERFECT
WAY TO END EVERY SUMMER.

492
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:59,146
- WE ENDED PRETTY GOOD, RIGHT?
- DID YOU KNOW THAT?

493
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,647
- THIS WAS THE BEST WAY
TO END THE SUMMER.

494
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:01,981
- AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT
MY FAVORITE ONE'S GONNA BE?

495
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,916
WHEN YOU TURN 21!
- UH-OH.

496
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,552
- OH!
- SERIOUSLY.

497
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,320
- UH-OH.
- HOW OLD ARE YOU GONNA BE?

498
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:08,755
50?
- 35.

499
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,157
- I'LL BE DEAD IN A GRAVE.
- [chuckles] BITCH.

500
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,991
- YOU'LL BE 35?
- YEAH.

501
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,260
AND SO WILL YOU.
- HEY, IT WAS GREAT--

502
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,694
- WHEN HE'S 21?
- YEAH, AND SO WILL YOU.

503
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,963
- NO, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
- EXACTLY.

504
