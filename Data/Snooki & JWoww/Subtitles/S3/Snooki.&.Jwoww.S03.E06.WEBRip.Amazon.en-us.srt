1
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:04,838
- BABE, CAN YOU ALLOW ME
TO ADOPT A BABY?

2
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:06,474
- JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR ON THAT,
WE AND ARE SIMPLY

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,578
LOOKING INTO IT AS
A POSSIBLE FUTURE ENDEAVOR.

4
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,246
WE WANT TO HAVE
OUR OWN CHILDREN FIRST, CORRECT?

5
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,082
- WHATEVER COMES FIRST.

6
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:15,349
- THEY'RE BEING GOOD RIGHT NOW.

7
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,551
THIS--NORMALLY
SHE JUST ATTACKS IT.

8
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:18,886
LIKE, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.
- NO, NO, NO.

9
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,888
I'VE ALREADY STAKED OUT
THE TERRITORY.

10
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,356
I OWNED IT.

11
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:24,558
- OH, MY GOD.

12
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,194
- I THINK THIS IS MY DRESS.

13
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:28,362
- IS THIS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?
OH, ROGER'S GONNA KILL ME.

14
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,498
- I WANT TO GET MARRIED!

15
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:33,101
- * I DON'T CARE *

16
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:34,602
* I LOVE IT *

17
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,470
* I DON'T CARE *

18
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,139
* I LOVE IT I LOVE IT *

19
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:40,541
* I DON'T CARE *

20
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:43,644
* I LOVE IT *

21
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,413
* I DON'T CARE *

22
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,149
[phone line rings]

23
00:00:48,216 --> 00:00:49,450
- HELLO.

24
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:52,019
- HEY, POOP.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

25
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,654
- I'M JUST REALLY EXCITED,

26
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:56,090
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE I WANT
TO START PLANNING RIGHT NOW

27
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:57,791
BECAUSE I FOUND
MY WEDDING DRESS,

28
00:00:57,858 --> 00:01:00,428
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
OR WHERE TO START.

29
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:01,695
- AWW...

30
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:02,830
- JENNI STOPPED
PLANNING HER WEDDING

31
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,298
BECAUSE IT WAS
SO STRESSFUL,

32
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:07,835
BUT I JUST NEED HER ADVICE,
LIKE WHERE DO I GO?

33
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,303
SHOULD WE START
LOOKING AT VENUES?

34
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,671
LIKE, I NEED YOUR HELP.

35
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:12,273
- I MEAN, I'M NOT
A PROFESSIONAL OR ANYTHING,

36
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,509
BUT I COULD ALWAYS
SHOW YOU WHAT I DID

37
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,245
AND KIND OF, LIKE,
DO THE STEPS THAT I DID

38
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,447
TALKING TO THE PEOPLE
THAT I TALKED TO.

39
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,014
THAT MIGHT HELP.

40
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:22,683
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'LL BE, LIKE--
- I'D LOVE THAT.

41
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,718
- OH, YOU WOULD?
- YEAH.

42
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:26,654
- PLANNING A WEDDING
IS VERY STRESSFUL,

43
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,789
TO THE POINT WHERE I QUIT.

44
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:30,458
SO--
- THAT SUCKS.

45
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,859
- GOOD LUCK, BOO.

46
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,461
- I DON'T LIKE BEING STRESSED.

47
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:35,563
- DO YOU WANT TO GO TODAY?
I HAVE NOTHING TO DO TODAY.

48
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:37,765
- DUDE, THANK GOD.

49
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:40,168
I REALLY CAN'T
FOLD ANY MORE SHIRTS.

50
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:42,870
- * I'D BE LOST *

51
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,072
* WITHOUT YOU *

52
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:46,340
* BY MY SIDE *

53
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:47,708
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

54
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,443
- YOU MEAN WHAT I WANT?
- YEAH.

55
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,345
LIKE WHAT'S YOUR DREAM WEDDING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

56
00:01:51,412 --> 00:01:52,613
- I WAS NEVER LIKE,

57
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,548
"OH, I ALWAYS ENVISIONED
THIS AND THIS."

58
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,251
LIKE, I'M NOT THAT LOSER.

59
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,787
- I HEARD THE THREE MOST
EXPENSIVE THINGS ABOUT A WEDDING

60
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,455
ARE THE FOOD, VENUE,
AND FLOWERS.

61
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:04,057
- CAN'T I DO
ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS?

62
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:12,200
- THIS IS KIND OF COOL.

63
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,635
- I'M KIND OF SCARED
OF HEIGHTS RIGHT NOW.

64
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,437
JENNI'S BRINGING ME
TO ONE ATLANTIC,

65
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:19,340
AND THIS IS THE VENUE
THAT SHE WOULD GET MARRIED AT

66
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:20,708
IF SHE WANTED TO GET MARRIED.

67
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,410
- BEAUTIFUL, RIGHT?
- THIS IS REALLY NICE.

68
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,012
- HI, WELCOME TO ONE ATLANTIC.

69
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:26,547
I'M ELIZABETH.
- GREAT TO MEET YOU. JENNI.

70
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:27,915
- HI, JENNI.
- THIS IS NICOLE.

71
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,417
- HI, NICOLE. WELCOME.

72
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:32,353
- ELIZABETH IS ONE ATLANTIC'S
WEDDING PLANNER,

73
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,955
WHO IS FABULOUS AND SMALL.

74
00:02:35,022 --> 00:02:38,692
I DON'T KNOW WHY I SAID SMALL.
I'M BEING RACIST.

75
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,261
- WE'D LIKE TO SAY LESS IS MORE

76
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:41,562
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THAT
BEAUTIFUL OCEAN VIEW.

77
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,098
- MORE IS MORE.

78
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,567
- MORE IS MORE, PERFECT.

79
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,102
- HAVE YOU NOT LOOKED AT US?

80
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:51,339
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT US
THAT SAYS LESS IS MORE.

81
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:54,041
- DO YOU ALLOW ZOO CREATURES?

82
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,976
- WHAT KIND OF ZOO CREATURES
ARE YOU THINKING OF?

83
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,645
- ELEPHANTS.

84
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,112
- DO YOU KNOW HOW BIG OF A
[bleep] AN ELEPHANT WOULD TAKE?

85
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:01,081
- THAT WOULD BE GROSS.
- YES. [laughs]

86
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:03,451
- A LEOPARD?
- WE CAN FIND OUT ABOUT THAT.

87
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,253
- A LION?
- [laughs]

88
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:06,820
- MONKEYS?
- MM-HMM.

89
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,656
- THE MONKEYS COULD
PASS OUT THE DRINKS.

90
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,624
- THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM.

91
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,959
THE BOARD OF HEALTH
IS NOT GONNA ALLOW THAT.

92
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,294
- OH.

93
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:16,264
JUST IDEAS, SO--
- I HEAR YOU. YEAH.

94
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,267
- * IF YOU CAN
BREAK THESE BINDS *

95
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,702
* FREEDOM'S
WHAT YOU'LL FIND *

96
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,772
- HEY, MR. SENECA,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

97
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,939
- HEY, JIONNI, HOW YOU DOING?
- GOOD, GOOD.

98
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,375
WE WANT TO GET MARRIED.

99
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:29,109
I DON'T WANT TO COME BACK
TO MY PARENTS' HOUSE,

100
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,878
SO WE'RE BUILDING A HOUSE, AND
WE'RE BUILDING IT FROM SCRATCH.

101
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,280
WE CAN DESIGN IT
HOWEVER WE WANT.

102
00:03:32,346 --> 00:03:33,481
THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT.

103
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,882
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE
NICOLE AND I

104
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,018
MAYBE OVER THERE TO WALK US
THROUGH SOME STUFF?

105
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:39,287
- YEAH, I THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

106
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:40,721
WHEN YOU'RE AVAILABLE,
LET ME KNOW.

107
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:43,156
- OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD.
I'LL TOUCH BASE WITH YOU LATER.

108
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,393
- MOMENTS LIKE THIS MAKES ME
REALLY FEEL LIKE AN ADULT.

109
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,628
WE'RE GOING TO MEET OUR
CONTRACTOR TO BUILD OUR HOUSE.

110
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,730
I MEAN, I'M AN ADULT NOW.

111
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:51,665
[singing] * YOU'RE GONNA
GET A HOUSE SOON *

112
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,302
* YOU'RE GONNA
GET A HOUSE SOON *

113
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,903
NO MORE GRANDMA'S HOUSE.

114
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,005
- LET THE PLANNING BEGIN.

115
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,942
SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT ANYTHING YET?

116
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,144
THE COLORS, THE LOOK, THE FEEL.

117
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,413
- I DON'T KNOW YET.

118
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,147
- YOUR SAVE-THE-DATES,
YOUR MENU CARDS,

119
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:10,851
THE LINENS, CHARGERS
ON ALL OF THE TABLES.

120
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:11,985
- WHAT'S A CHARGER?

121
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,654
- LOOK BEHIND YOU.

122
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,657
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING TO PUT
ALL OF YOUR ENTREE PLATES ON.

123
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:17,991
- IT'S JUST FOR SHOW?
- YEAH.

124
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,860
- YEAH, IT'S ANOTHER
DECOR ITEM.

125
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,829
- I WOULD USE IT FOR SALAD.

126
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,331
- [chuckles]

127
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,333
- DO YOU HAVE PICTURES
OF, LIKE, PAST WEDDINGS?

128
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,335
- WE DO, ABSOLUTELY.

129
00:04:27,335 --> 00:04:30,137
- OH, I LIKE THAT.

130
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:33,006
IT LOOKS LIKE INDIA.
- YEAH.

131
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:35,843
- THESE INDIAN WEDDINGS HAVE
ALL OF THOSE BEAUTIFUL GOLD,

132
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,378
ALL THOSE VIBRANT COLORS.

133
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,679
- DETAILS THAT YOU
WEREN'T THINKING.

134
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:40,981
- WE SHOULD BE INDIAN.
THIS IS SO FUN.

135
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:42,650
I WANT A PARADE.

136
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,084
- YOU CAN HAVE A PARADE.

137
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,353
- I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA
GET A PARADE.

138
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,520
- [laughs]

139
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:49,523
- DEFINITELY LOTS
OF THINGS TO DECIDE.

140
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,224
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?
- OVERWHELMED.

141
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,026
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

142
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:56,697
- JUST GOT TO TAKE IT
ONE STEP AT A TIME.

143
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,833
- THINK I'M GONNA HAVE A STROKE.
MY ARM HURTS.

144
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,502
- [chuckles]

145
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:04,137
HEY, WELCOME TO MY WORLD.
THIS IS WHY I PUT MINE ON HOLD.

146
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,673
[laughter]

147
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:13,781
- YOU READY FOR YOUR
TRAINING WITH THE GURU?

148
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,616
WE'RE GOING TO SEE
THE DOG TRAINER

149
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,385
AGAIN FOR THE SECOND TIME,

150
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:19,920
BUT I HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING WITH THE AIR HORN.

151
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,389
I ALREADY FAILED.

152
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,957
NOW I GOT TO CRAM FOR CLASS.

153
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:27,461
SIT, DOWN, STAND,
LAY D--LONG D--

154
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,296
UGH, THEY'RE NEVER
GONNA KNOW THIS. OKAY.

155
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:31,499
I WAS A VERY BIG PROCRASTINATOR
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

156
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,233
BACK OFF.

157
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,435
I FIND PROCRASTINATION
IS THE MOST

158
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:36,203
EFFICIENT WAY
OF DOING SOMETHING.

159
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,405
[blows air horn]

160
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:38,706
YEAH.

161
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,008
GET YOUR ASS
TO THE GRASS RIGHT NOW.

162
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,076
BECAUSE LIKE BAM,
I'M GONNA GET THIS [bleep] DONE

163
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:44,211
AND THEN BE DONE.

164
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,146
[blows air horn]

165
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,455
- LET'S GO SEE OUR NEW HOUSE.
THANK YOU.

166
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,089
- I HELPED DESIGN
THE BLUEPRINTS.

167
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,591
I DID A LOT OF
THE BLUEPRINTS AND CHANGING.

168
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,627
- WE.

169
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:04,432
- WE HELPED DESIGN--WE HELPED

170
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,033
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

171
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:08,502
- WHAT?
- LOOK AT THIS.

172
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,637
THIS IS OUR STREET.

173
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,738

MY WHOLE ENTIRE THING.

00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,789

00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:37,097
- I'M NOT MAD.
I'M JUST NOT REDOING IT. GO.

189
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:38,365
- THIS IS THE FRONT DOOR.

190
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:39,667

00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,484
- WE'RE BOTH COOKERS.
WE LIKE COOKING.

200
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:57,918

203
00:07:02,022 --> 00:07:04,725
- CABINETS ALONG THE BACK WALL,
CABINETS ALONG THE SIDE.

204
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,661

205
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:10,664
- YEAH, J, DON'T PUSH HER OFF.
I KNOW YOU MIGHT WANT TO.

00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,566
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S HIGH ENOUGH.
- AM I UPSTAIRS?

207
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,801

00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,641
- [screams]
- OH, MY GOD.

212
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,875
ONLY FOUR STEPS.

213
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,645
[laughs]
- I MISSED A FEW.

214
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:26,246
I THOUGHT I HAD IT,
AND I DIDN'T.

215
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,247
- OH, MY GOD.

216
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,682

218
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:33,353
- UGH, I JUST WANT TO DROP YOU
OFF WITH THE GURU FOR A WEEK.

219
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,723
MAMA NEEDS A BREAK.

220
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,157
NO BARKIN'.

221
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:39,192
HEY.

OH, LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE.

226
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,337
OH, YES, YOU CAN KISS ME.

227
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,640
- I FEEL LIKE MY DOGS TALKED
TO EACH OTHER AND SAID,

228
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:54,107
"WE'RE JUST GONNA
MAKE MOM LOOK LIKE

229
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,375
AN [bleep]
IN FRONT OF THIS GUY."

230
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,777
- OH, AND TONGUE TOO.
WE'LL DO TONGUE.

231
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,278
- JUST BECAUSE WE KNOW
HOW MUCH IT'LL PISS HER OFF

232
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:00,914
IF WE'RE GOOD
WITH EVERYONE ELSE BUT HER.

233
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,717
- DO ME A FAVOR, PICK HER UP.
I'M REALLY CURIOUS NOW.

234
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,553
- OH, IF SHE'S GONNA
COME AFTER YOU.

235
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,554
- HELLO.

236
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,888
WHO'S GOOD?

237
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,256
OH, HO, HO.

238
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,759
YOU WANT TO DO IT AGAIN?
YOU WANT TO DO IT AGAIN?

239
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,828
I DON'T--
- STOP IT RIGHT NOW.

240
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,096
- HEY, HERE IT IS.

241
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,364
- OOH.
- DON'T YOU DO THAT TO HER.

242
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,200
DON'T--PUT HER DOWN.

243
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,301
- BAD!

244
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,103
- BELLA'S A BITCH
JUST LIKE MOMMY.

245
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,905
YOU KNOW, RAISE THEM
LIKE YOUR OWN, AND&amp;

246
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,040
- OOP--

247
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:28,609
- SHE'S THE SPITTING IMAGE
OF ME RIGHT NOW.

248
00:08:28,676 --> 00:08:31,779
- LET'S TAKE DIESEL.

249
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,614
- DON'T!
- OH, MY GOD, DIESEL!

250
00:08:33,681 --> 00:08:34,648
[blows air horn]
- STOP IT.

251
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:35,716
- STOP IT.

252
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:36,650
- LET HIM GO.
LET HIM GO.

253
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:37,618
AH!
- DIESEL!

254
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:39,419
- HOLD ON!

255
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,589
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

256
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,824
THIS IS WHY NO DOGS LIKE YOU.

257
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:44,825
DIESEL IS MENTALLY CHALLENGED.

258
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,493
IT'S FINE.

259
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,962
HE'S OUR--HE'S OUR BABY, BUT YOU
KNOW, HE'S--HE HAS PROBLEMS.

260
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,665
SO THE NEXT TIME,
I CIRCLED THE SECTIONS

261
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:54,768
YOU NEED TO JUST TRY
AND WORK ON AS BEST YOU CAN

262
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,369
TO GET THEM PAST THE TEST.

263
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,905
SOCIALIZATION AND TRAINING.

264
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:00,373
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
ALL THE EQUIPMENT STUFF

265
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,409
THEY'LL PASS WITH NO PROBLEM.

266
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,177
- AS LONG AS IT MAKES
MY DOGS BETTER.

267
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:05,646
- IT WILL.

268
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:08,481
- SO WHEN DO YOU START,
LIKE, BUILDING STUFF?

269
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,150
- YOUR HOUSE?

270
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,418
IN ABOUT FOUR WEEKS, WE'LL START
BREAKING GROUND ON YOUR HOUSE.

271
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,753
- WHAT'S "BREAKING GROUND" MEAN?
- DIGGING.

272
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,987
- DIGGING.
WE'LL START BUILDING.

273
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:14,888
- LIKE THE BASEMENT?
- THE FOUNDATION.

274
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,123
- OKAY.

275
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,959
- BUT WHEN DO, LIKE,
STICKS GO UP?

276
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,427
- WALLS?
[laughter]

277
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,762
- WALL STARTS
ABOUT THE SAME TIME.

278
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:23,163
- SO WE CAN, LIKE,
DRIVE BY AND SEE THINGS.

279
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,031
- I HOPE YOU--I HOPE
YOU DON'T USE STICKS.

280
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,032
- EXACTLY, YEAH.

281
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,634
- NOT STICKS, WOOD.

282
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,235
- DA-DA, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- HE JUST WANTS TO CRY.

283
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,370
HE NEVER ACTS LIKE THIS,
I SWEAR.

284
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:32,973
- [crying]
[laughter]

285
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,441
- WHAT IS HE DOING?

286
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:35,776
- GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

287
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:38,111
- YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'M SO EXCITED.

288
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,246
- WE'LL BE TALKING.
- YES, SIR.

289
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,981
- DO YOUR WORK!
- I WILL.

290
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,515
- LET'S GET THIS HOUSE UP.
- IT'S COMING.

291
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,651
- WE GET THE HOUSE,
I HAVE A BABY.

292
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:44,852
I COULD GET PREGNANT RIGHT NOW.

293
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,286
- AND I BLAME YOU.
I KEEP BLAMING YOU GUYS.

294
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,354
- JIONNI KEEPS TELLING ME
TO PUT IT OFF.

295
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,288
I DON'T KNOW WHY.
- [laughs]

296
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,657
- PLEASE.

297
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,758
LORENZO'S GROUNDED.

298
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,660
- NICOLE.
- I'M KIDDING.

299
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:54,161
- HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

300
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,967
- ARE YOU EXCITED?

301
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:03,771
- YEAH, BUT WE'RE JUST SIMPLY
GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS, RIGHT?

302
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,272
- UNLESS THEY HAVE 'EM
AVAILABLE.

303
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,675
- THEY DON'T
HAVE BABIES AVAILABLE.

304
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,810
- TODAY, WE'RE OFF
TO AN ADOPTION FAIR.

305
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:11,578
- IT DOES SOUND WEIRD,
AN ADOPTION FAIR.

306
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,347
- MAYBE YOU THROW A BALL, KNOCK
DOWN SOME CANS, YOU WIN A BABY.

307
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:16,950
THROW A DART. I DON'T KNOW,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

308
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,585
- BABE.

309
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,387
- MAYBE I SHOULD PUT A SUIT ON.

310
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,122
- IT'S OUTSIDE.

311
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:24,191
- I KNOW, BUT I--THIS LOOKS LIKE
PEDOPHILE GEAR.

312
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:26,159
- YOU DON'T
LOOK LIKE A PEDOPHILE.

313
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,494
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT PEDOPHILES LOOK LIKE.

314
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,396
YOU'D HAVE TO HAVE, LIKE,
THE CREEPY VAN.

315
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,031
- WHO'S THIS GUY?

316
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:34,234
HE PROBABLY HAS A CRIMINAL
BACKGROUND, WHICH I DO, BUT--

317
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,903
- I DO, TOO.

318
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,871
- NO, I ACTUALLY DON'T.

319
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,606
- I DO.

320
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,174
- WE SHOULD PROBABLY
TAKE YOUR CAR

321
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:43,076
BECAUSE I'LL PROBABLY
SCARE ALL THE KIDS IN MY TRUCK.

322
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,644
- YOU SCARE GROWN MEN
WITH YOUR TRUCK.

323
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:46,146
- IT'S LIKE A MONSTER
ABDUCTION-MOBILE.

324
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,953
- * ONE MORE TRY SHE SAID *

325
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,755
* OH *

326
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,224
- [singing wedding march]

327
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,793
- [laughs]

328
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,462
OH, MY GOD.

329
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,964
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

330
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,365
- THIS IS WHAT
I'M GONNA LOOK LIKE.

331
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,466
- AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO
PUT IT OVER YOUR FACE?

332
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,902
- OH.

333
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,437
- SCARY WOMAN.

334
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,373
- YOU EMBARRASSED?

335
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,244
I, NICOLE, TAKE YOU,
JIONNI LAVELLE

336
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,747
[screaming]
TO BE MY HUSBAND.

337
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:20,948
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

338
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:21,815
ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT
DURING THE THING?

339
00:11:21,882 --> 00:11:23,183
- YES.

340
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,253
- YOU JUST KISSED MY CHIN.

341
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:30,623
THIS IS AWKWARD.
- [laughs]

342
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,392
WE'RE LEAVING LORENZO
WITH MY MOM,

343
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:34,561
AND ME AN JIONNI ARE GONNA
GO CHECK OUT STONE HOUSE.

344
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,796
IT'S OUR FIRST WEDDING VENUE

345
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,497
THAT WE'RE GONNA
CHECK OUT TOGETHER.

346
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:39,032
I WANT, LIKE, A HUGE MANSION,
YOU KNOW,

347
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:41,634
SO IT JUST LOOKS LIKE
I'M A PRINCESS IN A CASTLE.

348
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,636
- THANK YOU FOR COMING.
- NO PROBLEM.

349
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:44,637
- BUT WE GOT TO PLAN A WEDDING.
- LET'S SKEDADDLE.

350
00:11:44,772 --> 00:11:48,075
- ALL RIGHT. HAVE FUN.

351
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:52,479
- BABE, I THINK THIS IS IT.

352
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,647
OH, YEAH, LOOK.

353
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:55,983
- I'M NERVOUS.

354
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,885
- LET'S GO ADOPT A BABY.
- SHUT UP.

355
00:11:57,951 --> 00:11:59,352
- LET'S GO WIN A BABY.

356
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,521
- IT'S NOT--CLEARLY,
YOU DON'T WIN BABIES HERE.

357
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:04,091
- DO WE JUST, LIKE, ROLL UP
AND JUST TALK TO RANDOM PEOPLE?

358
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,358
- I DON'T KNOW.

359
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,626
THERE'S SOMEONE
THROWING A FOOTBALL.

360
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,495
- OH, I CAN DO THAT.
I'LL BOND WITH THAT GUY.

361
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,496
YOU TALK ABOUT BABIES.

362
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,564
- NO, I'M SCARED.

363
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:13,333
- THE WALK UP
WAS DEFINITELY AWKWARD.

364
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,935
WE'RE NOT PARENTS.
WE'VE NEVER ADOPTED A CHILD.

365
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:16,269
IT'S A PICNIC, YOU KNOW,

366
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,905
AND WE DIDN'T BRING
A POTATO SALAD, NOTHING.

367
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,207
- BUT WE SEE A BUNCH OF KIDS
AND A BUNCH OF FOOD,

368
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:23,376
AND WE'RE JUST CRASHING.
- YEAH, I'M ALL ABOUT IT.

369
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,677
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HI.

370
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:25,813
- OH, WE'RE DOING GOOD.
HOW ARE YOU?

371
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,347
- GOOD.
- NICE DAY.

372
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,615
- I'M ROGER.
THIS IS JENNI.

373
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:30,483
- HEY, I'M LIZ.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

374
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,185
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
THANKS FOR COMING, GUYS.

375
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,620
COME ON IN. IT'S ALL--
IT'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF CHATTIN'.

376
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,022
WE'RE GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
- COOL.

377
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,857
- NOW ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN ADOP--IN ADOPTION?

378
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,458
- YEAH.

379
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:40,828
MY MOTHER WAS ADOPTED,
AND MY BEST FRIEND WAS ADOPTED.

380
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:44,297
SO I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE A CHILD
THAT SAME LOVE AND CARE THAT,

381
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,899
YOU KNOW, MY BEST FRIEND
AND MOM HAD.

382
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,468
- AT ONE POINT, WE WERE
IN THE SAME STAGE THAT YOU WERE.

383
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:49,903
WE HAD NO IDEA.

384
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,704
- DO YOU FIND ANY DIFFICULTY

385
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,874
IN, LIKE, THE BONDING
PROCESS OR NO?

386
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:54,908
- YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.
- YEAH.

387
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,044
- NOTHING FEELS ANY DIFFERENT.

388
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,879
- KNOW AWKWARDNESS, NO--OH, WOW.
- NO.

389
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:02,382
- BEING HERE, YOU SEE THE
CLOSENESS AMONGST THE FAMILIES.

390
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,852
IT'S A HUGE,
EXTENDED SUPPORT GROUP,

391
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,619
BUT THEY EVEN
CALL EACH OTHER FAMILY.

392
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:07,921
IT'S A GOOD FEELING.

393
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09,156
- OH, ROGER.

394
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,457
- YOU WANT TO TOSS
THE BALL AROUND?

395
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:11,691
- I'LL RACE YOU, ROGER.
- YOU WANT TO RACE?

396
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:12,960
I'LL RACE YOU.
WHERE ARE WE RACING TO?

397
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:14,928
DUDE, I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN RUN THAT FAR.

398
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,964
- [laughs]
- I'M A OLD MAN.

399
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,298
- I HOPE HE DOESN'T
EMBARRASS HIMSELF.

400
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:21,902
- [laughs]
- GO!

401
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:24,604
- AH, YOU BEAT ME!

402
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,940
THAT WAS A PHOTO FINISH,
BUT I THINK YOU GOT ME.

403
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,242
- I REALLY THINK ROGER'S
BEEN READY TO HAVE KIDS,

404
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,344
BUT HE'S NERVOUS.

405
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,180
SO I JUST HOPE THAT
DOING THINGS LIKE THIS

406
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:36,349
WILL MAKE HIM REALIZE
THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE NERVOUS.

407
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,018
- YOU GOT A GOOD ARM.

408
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:41,721
- SEEING THESE PARENTS AND
THEIR CHILDREN MAKES ME REALIZE

409
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,523
THAT ME AND ROGER COULD BE
THESE PEOPLE ONE DAY.

410
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:47,961
- YOU WANT TO GO GET HIM TODAY?
- I HATE YOU.

411
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,897
ARE YOU READY TO GET GOIN'?
- SURE, YEAH.

412
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,032
- WELL, THANKS FOR COMING.
- NO, THANK YOU.

413
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:53,800
- ANYTIME, ANYTIME.

414
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:54,801
OH, MY GOD.

415
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,636
- GUYS, SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

416
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,505
I'M TAKING YOU UP
ON THAT RACE AGAIN SOON.

417
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,273
OVERWHELMINGLY, I WOULD SAY
WE CAME OUT OF THERE

418
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,242
WITH A VERY POSITIVE EXPERIENCE.

419
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,276
GET A HUG!
LET ME GET A HUG.

420
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,245
[laughter]

421
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:07,680
- AND, YOU KNOW, IF I WAS
EVER READY TO DO THIS,

422
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:08,916
NOW I DON'T THINK I WOULD
SECOND GUESS MYSELF.

423
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,550
I THINK I WOULD JUST DO IT.

424
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,352
- SEE YOU GUYS!
- BYE.

425
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,987
- I THINK I MIGHT'VE
STEPPED IN POOP.

426
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,822
- YOU DID?
- I DON'T KNOW. I SMELLED IT.

427
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:17,524
- SORRY, I HAD TO GO.

428
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,093
- ONE OF OUR MAIN CONCERNS
WAS THE COCKTAIL ROOM.

429
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,394
- I, LIKE,
WANT TO GO TO A WEDDING,

430
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,695
AND THEN I SEE, LIKE,
A LITTLE MENU,

431
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:23,830
AND YOU HAVE LIKE
THREE ENTREES TO CHOOSE FROM.

432
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:25,065
- MM-HMM.

433
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:26,399
- 'CAUSE EVERYONE
HAS DIFFERENT TASTES.

434
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:27,834
SO I WOULD LIKE THAT.

435
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,569
- OKAY.

436
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,571
- BUT THEN I FEEL LIKE
HE'S GONNA DO ALL THE FOOD.

437
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,140
THAT'S HIS JOB.
- OKAY. SO YOU CAN CHOOSE--

438
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,441
- YEAH, I ONLY GOT ONE JOB
IN THIS WHOLE THING.

439
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,542
- YOU'RE GONNA SELECT
THE ITEMS.

440
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,177
- YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

441
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:39,712
- WHAT OTHER DETAILS
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT?

442
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,114
- UM...

443
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,716
- HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
THE TYPE OF CEREMONY

444
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,785
AND WHO CAN MARRY YOU?

445
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,754
- NOT REALLY.

446
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,489
- HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT A PHOTOGRAPHER?

447
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,959
THE TYPE OF CAKE
THAT YOU'D LIKE?

448
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,761
- both: NOPE.
- A BAND OR A DJ?

449
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:58,999
- THERE ANYTHING THAT'S REALLY
IMPORTANT TO THE TWO OF YOU?

450
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,067
A LOT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT.

451
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,303
- I'M SO CONFUSED.
- OH.

452
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,571
- JIONNI'S STARTING
TO REALIZE, YOU KNOW,

453
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:06,539
WHAT IT TAKES
TO PLAN A WEDDING.

454
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,408
I MEAN, I'VE ALREADY KIND OF

455
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,077
GOT MY ASS HANDED TO ME
WITH THIS,

456
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:13,346
SO I FEEL LIKE NOW IT'S JIONNI'S
TURN TO BE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.

457
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,681
WE HAVE A LOT OF [bleep]
TO PLAN."

458
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,149
AND NOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER

459
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,018
BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH
ON THE SAME PAGE.

460
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,819
- THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, GUYS.
APPRECIATE IT.

461
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:20,988
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

462
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,455
- WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

463
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,391
[sighs]

464
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,526
- I WOULD REALLY LIKE
A DESTINATION WEDDING.

465
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,028
I WOULD LOVE TO GET MARRIED
IN DISNEY.

466
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,631
DISNEY, FIREWORKS, A PRINCESS.

467
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,166
YOU WANT TO BE A PRINCESS,
WE'RE GONNA BE IN A CASTLE.

468
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:35,702
WE'LL GET MARRIED IN A CASTLE,
A REAL CASTLE, NOT--

469
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,604
NOT A HIGH CEILING--
- WALT DISNEY CASTLE?

470
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,905
- YES! YES.

471
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:41,074
- WITH MICKEY
AND MINNIE MOUSE THERE.

472
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,475
- EVEN BETTER.

473
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:46,313
I'LL MAKE THE PHONE CALL
TOMORROW TO WALT HIMSELF.

474
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,680
- HE'S FROZEN.

475
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,316
- WELL, HE CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.

476
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,817
- WHY IS HE FROZEN?

477
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,852
- HE'S AN HISTORIC MAN.
HE INVENTED EVERYTHING.

478
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,788
- OH, I THINK THEY FROZE HIM
BECAUSE THEN THEY WANT...

479
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:58,525
- HE'S THE CREATOR.
HE'S A LEGEND.

480
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:02,562
- TO MAKE HIM ALIVE AGAIN
IN THE FUTURE FOR MORE CARTOONS.

481
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,831
- IF IT WASN'T FOR WALT,
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.

482
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,199
NO LION KING,
NO MICKEY AND MINNIE.

483
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:08,235
- STOP.
- WALT'S EVERYTHING.

484
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,037
- WALT'S A GENIUS.

485
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,538
I WONDER IF THEY'LL
EVER WAKE HIM UP.

486
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,510
- THERE'S MORE
SNOOKI AND JWOWW ON THE WAY...

487
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,646
- AND IT CONTINUES NOW.

488
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,817
- [laughing]

489
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,286
- DA-DA-DA!

490
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,755
OH...

491
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,523
OH, MY GOD...

492
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,524
- MY TURN.

493
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:34,461
MY TURN. HI.

494
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,495
- [crying]
- STOP IT.

495
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:37,630
- OH-HO-HO.

496
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,267
- EW, STOP.
YOU'RE SO RUDE.

497
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,834
JIONNI, WALK AWAY.

498
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:45,472
- EVERY TIME I HAND LORENZO
TO NICOLE, HE JUST CRIES.

499
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,074
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

500
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,742
- BUT YOU LOVE THE FACT
THAT HE WANTS YOU ALL THE TIME.

501
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:50,877
- NO, I DON'T LOVE IT.

502
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,844
IT JUST--
- YEAH, YOU DO.

503
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,080
YOU DO IT ON PURPOSE.

504
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,481
- [crying]
- BABE, HE WANTS ME.

505
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:57,350
- NO, HE WANTS ME.

506
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,086
NO.
- MM, MISSED YOU.

507
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:02,255
IT WAS TOO LONG.

508
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:11,598
- WHY DOESN'T HE LIKE ME?
- BUM, BUM, BUM, BUM.

509
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,766
- SO WHAT DID YOU THINK
OF THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE?

510
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,102
- I REALLY LOVED IT.

511
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:15,968
I FELL IN LOVE
WITH ALL THOSE FAMILIES.

512
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:17,170
- THE KIDS WERE GREAT.

513
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,671
I WAS HAVING FUN
PLAYING WITH THEM.

514
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:19,672
- THEY'RE AMAZING.

515
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,841
SO NOW WHAT?

516
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:25,178
- NOW IF YOU ARE OVULATING,
WE COULD GO TRY TO HAVE A BABY.

517
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:28,615
- I MEAN, WE LITERALLY
JUST LEFT THE ADOPTION PICNIC.

518
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:29,716
NO, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

519
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,384
YOU WANT A BABY NOW?
- NO.

520
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:32,719
- DIDN'T THINK SO.

521
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,322
- BUT WE CAN PRACTICE
BABY-MAKIN'.

522
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:41,828
- IT'S SLEEPY TIME NOW.
IT'S SLEEPY TIME.

523
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,463
HERE'S A PAD.

524
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,733
I WANT YOU TO WRITE DOWN THE
THINGS THAT MEAN THE MOST TO YOU

525
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,901
FOR THE WEDDING IN WHAT
YOU REALLY, REALLY WANT,

526
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,370
LIKE WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU.

527
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,905
- IS THIS LIKE
JENNI AND ROGER'S PROBLEM LIST?

528
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:55,142
- NO.
THIS IS OUR WEDDING.

529
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:56,376
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT JIONNI
REALLY WANTS TO DO

530
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,311
FOR THE WEDDING,
AND I WANT HIM TO KNOW

531
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:01,781

00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,150
- HMM.

533
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,385
HOW MANY YOU HAVE?

534
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:07,154
- ONE.
- ONE?

535
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,223
- [laughs]

536
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,525
- I HAVE SIX
THAT I CAN THINK OF.

537
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,395
- SHOULD I PUT THINGS
THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT?

538
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,164
- JIONNI.

539
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:20,233
- [clears throat]
MY WEDDING IDEAS.

540
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,001
GOOD FOOD OPTIONS.

541
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,170
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY.

542
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:26,339
A BIG COCKTAIL ROOM.
- MM-HMM.

543
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,676
- MY LAST ONE IS--

544
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:30,677
JUST FORGET IT.
IT'S NOT A GOOD ONE.

545
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,780
- WHAT? TELL ME.

546
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,749
- [chuckles]
A SMALL AFTER PARTY.

547
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,251
- OH, THAT'S WHAT I WANTED.

548
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,620
- IF I'M NOT TOO TIRED.

549
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:41,854
- ARE YOU [bleep] KIDDING ME?

550
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,591
I MEAN, COME ON.

551
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,193
THAT'S LIKE MY DAD.

552
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,261
- MY DAD, YEAH.
HE'S GETTING OLD, SO--

553
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,564
- IS THAT IT?
- GO AHEAD.

554
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,633
- "WEDDING,"
WITH STARS AROUND IT.

555
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,635
NO MATTER WHERE WE ARE,

556
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,204
I WANT TO PULL UP
IN A HORSE AND CARRIAGE

557
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:58,605
'CAUSE I'M A PRINCESS
FOR THE DAY.

558
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:03,310
- YOU DON'T WANT TO JUST
WALK DOWN THE AISLE?

559
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,777
- YEAH.

560
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,112
I'M GONNA PULL UP
IN HORSE AND CARRIAGE,

561
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,214
AND THEN I'M GONNA
WALK DOWN THE AISLE.

562
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,748
- OH, PULL UP. OKAY.
I THINK--

563
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,016
- I'M NOT GONNA GO DOWN THE
AISLE IN A HORSE AND CARRIAGE.

564
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,218
THAT'S TOO EXTREME.
- WELL, BE MORE SPECIFIC.

565
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,721
- OKAY.
HORSE AND CARRIAGE TO RUNWAY.

566
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:18,124
WHAT'S IT CALLED?

567
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:22,028
- RUNWAY.
- RUNWAY.

568
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,496
I WANT DRUNK FOOD
FOR OUR GUESTS.

569
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:26,533
- DRUNK FOOD?
- YEAH, LIKE WHEN--THE MUNCHIES.

570
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,435
- OKAY.

571
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,670
- I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE BABY
NUMBER TWO AFTER OUR WEDDING.

572
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:34,474
- LIKE THAT NIGHT?
- YEAH. LIKE, I WANT A BABY.

573
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,309
- GOD.

574
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,078
- I WOULD LOVE
TO WRITE OUR OWN VOWS.

575
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,880
- WRITE OWN VOWELS?

576
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:42,482
- WRITE OUR OWN VOWS.

577
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:46,653
- WELL, THERE--WE GOT
TO COMPROMISE ON THAT.

578
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,020
- OKAY.

579
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,957
- I'M GONNA WRITE THINGS
I DON'T WANT TO DO.

580
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,326
- WHAT WOULD YOU NOT
WANT TO DO AT A WEDDING?

581
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,394
- SAY MY OWN VOWELS.

582
00:19:54,461 --> 00:19:55,762
- JIONNI.

583
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:56,996
- ALL RIGHT.

584
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,466
IT WAS A GOOD S--
A GOOD DAY, A GOOD START.

585
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,100
I FEEL LIKE NICOLE AND I
COVERED A LOT.

586
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:04,437
I'M VERY HAPPY WE'RE
ON THE SAME PAGE TOGETHER.

587
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:05,872
- [blows raspberry]

588
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,840
[gasps]
CAN YOU CARRY ME UP THE STAIRS

589
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,141
LIKE WE JUST GOT MARRIED?

590
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,379
- LET'S GO, MRS. LAVELLE.
- OH, MY GOD.

591
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,913
I CAN'T BELIEVE
MY LAST NAME'S GONNA CHANGE.

592
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,016
THAT'S SO WEIRD.
[giggles]

593
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:20,987
[laughs]
JIONNI, PLEASE.

594
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,356
I'M GONNA [bleep].
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

595

PLEASE.

596
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,325
SHH, THE BABY.

YOU FARTED.

601
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:32,932
STOP.

OH, [bleep].

603
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,873
- TODAY, WE ARE GONNA BE
DOING A PUPPET SHOW.

604
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,742
YEE-HAW!

605
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,678
- YOU'RE A HORSE, NOT A DONKEY.
- [laughs]

606
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,881
- I WOULD HONESTLY LOVE
IF WE COULD KIND OF GIVE ROGER,

607
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,116
LIKE, A BABY BOOT CAMP.

608
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,651
- I'M TOTALLY DOWN FOR THAT.

609
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:53,720
ROGER, THE BABY POOPED.

610
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,922
ROGER, LORENZO
THREW UP EVERYWHERE.

611
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:56,055
- HE WANTS TO
PUNCH US ALL IN THE FACE.
