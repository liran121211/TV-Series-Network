- I KNOW,
AND IT MIGHT TAKE A LONG TIME.

204
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,974
- YOU CAN'T SAY THAT
AND THEN NOT DO IT.

205
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,476
I'M GETTING SO EXCITED.
- IT MIGHT TAKE A LONG TIME.

206
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,143

207
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,480

00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:38,992

231
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,393

232
00:07:40,528 --> 00:07:42,530
- ME AND JENNI DID IT.
RON, YOU'D BE IMPRESSED.

233
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,064
- YOU MIGHT WANT
THIS SIDE OF THE GRILL.

234
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,533
- JIONNI!

235
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,367
[laughs]

238
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:53,306
AND IT JUST FEELS NICE.

239
00:07:53,373 --> 00:07:57,010
SO...ENGAGEMENT?

240
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,311
- I THINK YOU'RE ASKING
THE WRONG PERSON.

241
00:07:58,378 --> 00:07:59,780
[laughing]
- ENGAGEMENT?

242
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:02,550
- NO. NO RUSH.
- SHE WON'T PROPOSE TO ME.

243
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,552
I DON'T GET IT.

244
00:08:04,552 --> 00:08:06,954
- [laughing]
I CALL [bleep] TO THAT.

245
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,156
I SAY TOMORROW IF RONNIE
POPPED THE QUESTION,

246
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,324
SAMMI WOULD SAY YES
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

247
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:14,294
- NICOLE, MAYBE NOW IS A GOOD
TIME TO TELL THEM WHAT YOU ARE.

248
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:17,030
- SO I WENT AND GOT
A DNA TEST.

249
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,198
- WHAT ARE YOU?

250
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,867
- I'M NOT EVEN CHILEAN
AT ALL.

251
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,702
- [gasps] GET OUT!
- REALLY?

252
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:24,004
- NO, WHAT'D THEY SAY?
- THEY SAID I WAS BORN IN CHILE,

253
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:27,875
BUT MY HERITAGE
IS SLOVAKIAN,

254
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,643
ROMANIAN,

255
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,845
GYPSY, RUSSIAN,

256
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,313
AND A LITTLE ASIAN.

257
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,848
- DON'T FORGET
THE JEWISH PART.

258
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:37,851
- "DON'T FORGET
THE JEWISH PART," HE GOES!

259
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,987
- NO, NOT LIKE
WHAT I BELIEVE IN,

260
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,855
LIKE, IT--LIKE, ISRAEL.

261
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,423
- YOU'RE JUST EVERYTHING.
- ISRAELIAN.

262
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,792
- GET YOUR YARMULKES ON.

263
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,960
I GOT CORNED BEEF
AND CABBAGE COMING.

264
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,629
- I WOULD HAVE BET
MY LIFE SAVINGS

265
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,598
THAT SHE IS
[bleep] 100% CHILEAN.

266
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,465
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
SOME OF THE FOOD'S OUT.

267
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,234
- YOU DON'T GOTTA
TELL ME TWICE.

268
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,369
- YEAH, LET'S DO IT.
- I'LL DO IT WITH YOU.

269
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,106
- BOW YOUR HEADS.
- EVERYBODY HOLDS HANDS.

270
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:01,308
- I THANK GOD FOR THIS FOOD
WE'RE ABOUT TO EAT,

271
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,343

- THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

276
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,485
- AS NICOLE WOULD SAY,
MAZEL TOV!

277
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,687
- JIONNI!

278
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,222
[laughter]

279
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,858
- YOU ALL GOT YARMULKES
UPSTAIRS--NOW, PUT 'EM ON.

280
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:23,430

283
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,638

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,314

00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:46,453
GO TO BEACHCOMBER,

- I JUST TOLD SAM

299
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,741
HOW, LIKE, AWESOME IT IS
TO HAVE A CHILD.

300
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:08,976
- DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT HER FART?

301
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:10,778
- JIONNI!
- YEAH, THAT WAS FUNNY.

302
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,345
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU?
OKAY.

303
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,514
- IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE,
NICOLE, IT COULD HAVE--

304
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:15,548
- I COULD HAVE [bleep].
- YEP.

305
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,850
- DANNY'S GIRL--

306
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,218
SHE [bleep] EVERYWHERE,
LIKE, TWICE.

307
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,586
- THAT'S AWKWARD.
- HE TOLD ME.

308
00:10:19,653 --> 00:10:21,321
- WAIT, HE TOLD YOU?
- HE SAW THE [bleep]?

309
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,023
- YEAH, HE SAW
EVERYTHING COME OUT.

310
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,524
- EW.
- HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH.

311
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,159
SHE [bleep] TWICE,
AND THEN THE BABY CAME OUT."

312
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,095
- LANDED IN THE [bleep],
OR...

313
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:29,296
- NO, THEY CLEAN
THE [bleep] UP.

314
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,264
- THEY PROBABLY GRAB IT.

315
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,366
- DO YOU WANT ANOTHER DRINK?
- I'M GOOD.

316
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,202

00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:41,341
- I CAN'T DEAL HOW YOU GUYS
ARE STILL MUSHY

320
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,310
LIKE THE FIRST WEEK
YOU GUYS STARTED DATING.

321
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:45,512
- LATELY, IT'S BEEN--
KNOCK ON WOOD--

322
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,080
IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD.

323
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,616
- I'M JUST SO HAPPY
THAT, YOU KNOW,

324
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,151
THEY MOVED IN TOGETHER,

325
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:52,820
THEY HARDLY FIGHT ANYMORE,

326
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:55,122
AND THEY'RE JUST LIKE
A GROWN COUPLE.

327
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:57,190
YOU DON'T WANT TO GET
ENGAGED SOON?

328
00:10:57,257 --> 00:10:58,792
- I'M NOT IN A RUSH FOR IT.

329
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,427
I'M STILL, LIKE, SELFISH.

330
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,495
LIKE, I STILL WANT TO LIVE
MY LIFE FOR MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

331
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,932
- THAT'S WHAT JENNI SAID, BUT
NOW SHE WANTS TO START TRYING.

332
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,934
- TO HAVE KIDS?

333
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,002
I HOPE SO.
- I'VE BEEN BEGGING HER

334
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,138
TO HAVE A BABY.
SHE'S LIKE, "NO!

335
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:12,740
I LIKE TO GIVE THEM BACK."

336
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,975
BUT I KNOW IN HER HEAD
SHE REALLY WANTS A BABY.

337
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,777
- WE'RE BUILDING A HOUSE
ON MAIN.

338
00:11:16,844 --> 00:11:19,146
- OH, REALLY?

00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:22,615
- [laughs]
YEAH.

341
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,584
- I THINK WE'D BE, LIKE,
THE CUTEST PREGNANT LADIES.

342
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,120

343
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,588

00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:31,358
AND NOW YOU THINK
I WANNA SIGN UP FOR THAT?

00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:34,928
- YOU'D BE TERRIBLE.

348
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,764
SHE'S MOODY NOW.

349
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,466
- LOOK, CAN YOU IMAGINE US
BEING TERRIBLE TOGETHER?

350
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,401
- NO, I'M NOT! REALLY?

351
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:43,270
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT DEE
WOULD MAKE A GOOD PREGNANT LADY.

352
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:45,572
I THINK SHE'LL BE MISERABLE
JUST LIKE ME.

427
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,647
OF JENNI'S VAGINA RIGHT NOW,
I COULDN'T DO IT.

452
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:33,866
I WANT TO SIT OUTSIDE

CAN I HAVE MY WINE?

481
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,111

507
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,500
- CALL HER?

508
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:50,737
LET'S PRETEND WE'RE MAD
ABOUT THE CUSHION.

509
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:53,140
[line ringing]

510
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:55,142

00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:01,414
- HI.

514
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:04,284

ABOUT YOUR CUSHION.

515
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:06,186
- SON OF A GUN, YOU.
- I'M GONNA PAY FOR IT.

516
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,288
I TRIPPED
OVER MY [bleep] SANDAL.

517
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,190
- I'M GONNA LOSE THE DEPOSIT
ON THIS HOUSE NOW

518
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,825
SINCE YOU STAINED MY COUCH.

519
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:15,895

520
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:19,166
AND LORENZO

521
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,333

I'LL PAY
FOR THE [bleep] COUCH.

525
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,007
- WELL, I WISH I GOT
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

526
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,177
WE LITERALLY WOKE UP, LIKE,
TEN MINUTES AFTER YOU LEFT.

527
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,611
- OH, I'M SORRY.
YEAH, WE HAD TO GO.

528
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,647
CHRIS HAS WORK,
AND I HAVE TO BE IN THE CITY.

529
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:36,249
- I'M REALLY NOT UPSET
ABOUT THE COUCH.

530
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:38,050
I MEAN, IT'S A SHORE HOUSE.
[bleep] HAPPENS.

DEENA AND CHRIS

534
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,090
WERE LIKE AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE

00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,892
JENNI HAD THE KID'S NAME

546
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,414
PUT IT RIGHT IN MY COFFEE,
BUDDY--NICE!

547
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,849
YOU'RE GONNA BE KILLING
THOSE BOARDWALK GAMES LATER.

548
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,219
- IT WAS SO FUN TO HAVE
THE OLD ROOMIES OVER.

549
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:13,420
WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

550
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,222

COME HERE.
OOH!

- RONNIE AND SAM
ARE AWESOME WITH LORENZO,

555
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,664
AND I HONESTLY WOULD
TRUST THEM TO BABYSIT.

556
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:26,299
- HE'S COMING HOME WITH ME.

557
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,601
- NO, HE'S NOT.
- UH, WE'RE TAKING THE BABY.

558
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,002
AND WE'RE TAKING THE BABY,
BY THE WAY.

559
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:32,339
- THEY WOULD BE
A-MAZING PARENTS.

560
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,906

561
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,408

MY OLD FRIENDS.

565
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,814
ROOMMATE NIGHT
WAS DEFINITELY A SUCCESS.

566
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,550
- YES, WE HAD AN AMAZING TIME,

567
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,519
AND I'M SO GLAD WE DECIDED
TO DO THE COUPLES NIGHT,

568
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:49,456
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
THAT'S JUST HOW WE DO IT NOW.

569
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,990
- COUPLES.
- MM-HMM.

570
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:52,659
SHOULD I GET DETERGENT?

00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,932
PAIN IN MY [bleep].

00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,868
PAIN IN YOUR [bleep]?
[Nicole laughs]

574
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:04,136

WATER FIRST.

575
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,972
ALL RIGHT, HEADS UP.

576
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,774
OH, MY GOD!
JIONNI.

577
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,709
YOU DON'T WANNA GET IT
SOAKED LIKE THAT.

578
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:10,910
- LET IT GO.

579
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,079

00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,289
- JESUS!
both: RIGHT HERE!

584
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:23,790
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT STUNG ME.

585
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,892

587
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,095
- JIONNI, IT'S BAD.

588
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:32,699
GOD PUNCHED YOU
FOR BEING RUDE TO ME.

589
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:33,933
- YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY
DYING RIGHT NOW.

590
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,536
A SLOW DEATH.
- OH, MY GOD, STOP!

591
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,273
- I DID NOT INHALE,

592
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,841
AND I DID NOT HAVE SEX
WITH THAT GIRL.

593
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,142
- YES, YOU DID!

594
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,377
[both laughing]

595
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:48,114
[horns honking]

596
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,182
- OH, MY--
