- I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT
TO DUNK LORENZO UNDERWATER.

166
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,042
THE POINT OF ME AND LORENZO
GOING TO THESE CLASSES

TO BOND.

00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,777
IS FAILING AS A FATHER.

351
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:45,212
THAT'S WHY I'M

352
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,680
ALMOST 40 YEARS OLD,
AND I'VE NEVER DONE IT.

353
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:48,615
- YEAH, IT'S A DIFFERENT--
IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD.

354
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,183
IT'S ALWAYS A GOOD FEELING
TO HAVE A BABY

355
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,518
WITH YOUR LOVED ONE.

356
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:53,220
- I'M JUST SCARED.
I'M SCARED TO FAIL.

357
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,288
SO BECAUSE OF THAT, I'VE ALWAYS
GONE WITH THE SAFE ROUTE,

358
00:10:55,355 --> 00:10:57,390
AND THE SAFE ROUTE
IS NOT HAVING ANY.

359
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:58,658
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

360
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,060
I'VE DEFINITELY NOTICED
THAT JENNI

361
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,494
IS FLIP-FLOPPING
A LITTLE LATELY,

362
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,297
ESPECIALLY WITH SPENDING
SO MUCH TIME WITH NICOLE.

363
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,768
YOU KNOW, WEDDING PLANNING
AND WEDDING DRESS SHOPPING

364
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,203
AND SAYING, YOU KNOW,
SHE'S MORE INCLINED

365
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,438
TO GET MARRIED NOW.

366
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,339
- GOING TO THE VENUES
AND [bleep].

367
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,741
- MORE WANTING TO HAVE KIDS.

368
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:16,043
THE OTHER DAY, SHE TOLD ME
SHE WAS OVULATING.

369
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,245
- WELL, GET ON THAT [bleep],
MAN.

370
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,512
- IF SHE REALLY WANTS
TO HAVE A KID,

371
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,647
AND SHE REALLY WANTS
TO GET MARRIED,

372
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,282
I HOPE SHE WOULD JUST
SAY IT.

373
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,251
BUT SHE'LL KIND OF JUST, LIKE,
DROP HINTS

374
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,519
AND SAY IT IN PASSING
WHILE SHE'S DRINKING

375
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,055
AND THEN BLOWS IT OFF
THE NEXT DAY.

376
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,557
JUST LOOK ME IN THE EYES
AND SAY WHAT YOU WANT.

377
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,525
YOU KNOW,
IT'S SO CONFUSING.

378
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,394
I JUST FEEL LIKE
WE'RE NOT READY.

379
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:35,763
WE'RE NOT IN THAT...

380
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,364
- MAYBE SHE SAW THAT--
- STATE OF MIND

381
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,433
OR THAT STAGE
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP

382
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,035
WHERE WE'RE SOLID ENOUGH
TO COMMIT

383
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,771
TO SOMETHING THAT BIG,
YOU KNOW?

384
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,807
WE STILL HAVE DAYS
WHERE IT'S THIS POWER STRUGGLE

385
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,109
FOR WHO RUNS THE SHOW,
YOU KNOW?

386
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,844
AND SHE WANTS TO RUN
THE SHOW,

387
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,079
AND I WANT TO RUN THE SHOW,

388
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:55,282
AND YOU CAN ONLY HAVE
ONE CAPTAIN.

389
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:56,850
- SHALL WE GET
THIS PARTY STARTED?

390
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,651
- YEAH!
- YES!

391
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:00,988
- OOH!

392
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,990
- OH, MY GOD, I LOVE THIS.

393
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,825
- NEED SOME PROFESSIONAL HELP
WITH THIS.

394
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,593
- OH, MY GOD.

395
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,896
SHAVE YOUR [bleep] FACE, DUDE.
COME ON.

396
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:11,799
[techno music]

397
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,033
- THESE ARE HEAVY.

398
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,401
JENNI, IS THIS HOW YOU FEEL
EVERY DAY?

399
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,836
- UH-HUH.
- OH, MY GOD.

400
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,009
[techno music]

401
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,377
- CAN YOU GIVE ME BIG LIPS?
- BIG LIPS?

402
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,046
- YEAH, LIKE, RED.

403
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:27,848
- PARTY IS HERE!

404
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,017
- OH, MY GOD.
- [laughs]

405
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,819
- I NEED AN OUTFIT.

406
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,321
- WHERE IS YOUR WIG?

407
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,023
- YOU LOOK LIKE
AN ATLANTIC CITY HOOKER.

408
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,191
- I'M GONNA [bleep] CHANGE.
[bleep] YOU GUYS.

409
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,093
* *

410
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,862
- MISS [bleep] IS COMING

411
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:46,499
* *

412
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,101
- YOU'RE PRETTY!

413
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,102
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU LOOK HOT.

414
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,570
- WE'RE CATWALKING.

415
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,739
- DRAG RUNWAY SHOW!

416
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,607
- * DON'T, DON'T, DON'T *

417
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:55,608
* DON'T STOP *

418
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:56,676

THE BLONDE BOMBSHELL.

420
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,379
BODY TO THE FLOOR, HONEY.

421
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,348

[shrieking]

00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,085
- * DON'T, DON'T *

424
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,153
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU LOOK LIKE JWOWW.

425
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,855
- WHAT A FAMILY OF DRAG.

426
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,156
- I FEEL LIKE,
OUT OF EVERYBODY,

427
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:10,858
CLEARLY, MISS FAME HAS
THE BEST WALK.

428
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,326
- GO, GIRL.

429
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,594

00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,868
- WHAT YOU GONNA DO?
WHAT YOU GONNA DO?

433
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:23,003
- I'VE NEVER SEEN MISS FAME
BE LIKE--

434
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,337
AND SHE WAS LIKE THAT.

435
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,273
AND I LOVED IT.

436
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,975
- I CAN'T HELP IT.
I'M SUPER MANLY--

437
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,877
AND MY PHONE JUST FELL
OUT OF MY DRESS.

438
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,112
[laughter, squeals]

439
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,413
- HIS BALLS JUST CAME OUT.

440
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,316
- I AM
THE WORST DRAG QUEEN EVER.

441
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,685
- [giggling]

442
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:40,787
- OH.

443
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:41,889
I CAN'T TWERK.

444
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:43,456
IT'S LIKE
A TWERK PARTY RIGHT NOW.

445
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:44,791
JENNI'S DOING IT!

446

THEY'RE JIGGLING EVERYWHERE.

[techno music]

454

00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,310
I CAN'T EVER BE A STRIPPER.
I'M ALL, WHEW!

457
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:06,046

- [squeals]
THAT ONE LICKED MY BUTT!

459
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,183
- YO, DO WE EVEN WANT
TO GO IN THERE?

460
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,484
- I DON'T KNOW.

464
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,360
- I JUST WALKED INTO
THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW.

465
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,761
LET'S BE HONEST.

466
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,196
HOW ARE YOU?

A BIT TIRED.

484
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,095
I LOVE MY JOEYS,
BUT IT'S TIME FOR ME TO LEAVE.

488
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,734
- RIGHT NOW,
I'M GONNA CRY.

489
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,270

491
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,641
A BALL'S HANGING OUT!

492
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,742
A BALL IS--

OH, MY GOD!

495
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,982
- YOUR BALLS ARE SO RED.

496
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,183
JENNI, ARE MY BALLS RED?

497
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:17,317

00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:23,256
- EW!

501
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,824
I SAW YOUR JOEY'S BALL,

502
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,893
AND THAT OFFICIALLY ENDED
MY NIGHT.

503
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,528

- GET IN HERE.
- ALL RIGHT, BIG GUY.

507
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,766

508
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,002

ALL RIGHT?

- I DIDN'T TOUCH ANYTHING!
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

512
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:41,041
HE LIKES TO LINGER
WITH THE HUGS.

513
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,275
- AND HIS BALLS ARE OUT.

514
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,245
- IS THAT TRUE?
WAS IT OUT?

515
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,746
WAS IT OUT?
WAS THE BALL OUT?

516
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,281
- [laughing]
I DON'T KNOW.

517
00:15:48,348 --> 00:15:50,917
- I'M GONNA BE [bleep] ANNOYED
IF THE BALL WAS OUT.

518
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,385
[crickets chirping]

519
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,520
- I'M GONNA TRY TO MAKE MONEY

520
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:55,222
AND HIRE YOU

528
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,173
- I LOVE THAT YOU LOVE
ALL MY GAY FRIENDS.

529
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,607
- OF COURSE.
WHY WOULDN'T I?

I HAVE A GREY HAIR.

00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,177
- WHAT?

532
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,478

I HAVE A GREY HAIR.

533
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,880
- SO?
- THAT MEANS I'M GETTING OLD.

534

- IT DOES NOT.

00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,883
- WE'LL [bleep] GET A NANNY.

536
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,518
WE SHOULD HAVE A KID,
SO MY OVARIES DON'T--

537
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:27,320
- WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM?
JENNI IS DRUNK.

538
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,056
AND THE REASON HOW I KNOW
JENNI IS DRUNK

539
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,058
IS 'CAUSE SHE'S TALKING
ABOUT HAVING BABIES.

540
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,925
THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW
JENNI'S DRUNK.

541
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,827
YOU'VE NEVER SAID
TO ME SOBER,

00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:35,962
"I WANT TO HAVE A KID.
LET'S START."

543
00:16:36,063 --> 00:16:37,230
YOU'VE NEVER SAID THAT
TO ME.

00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,232
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT
SOBER OR DRUNK.

00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,900
- YOU JUST SAID IT.

546
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,702
- I WANT TO HAVE A KID, YES,

547
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:43,936
BUT IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

548
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:46,073
- IT'S VERY CONFUSING
FOR ME WHEN,

549
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,407
80% OF THE TIME,
YOU'RE SOBER,

550
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:49,842
AND YOU'RE OF THE SAME MIND-SET
THAT I AM,

551
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,511
AND THAT IS, WE WANT
TO DO THAT ONE DAY,

552
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,513
WE WANT TO HAVE KIDS ONE DAY,
BUT WE'RE NOT READY TODAY,

553
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,348
TO YOU TELLING ME
THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE BABIES

554
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,349
AND GET MARRIED.

555
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,451
- I'M A LITTLE INTOXICATED,

556
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,287
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I GOT IT OUT,

557
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,255
AND I'M REALLY ITCHY
IN MY ARMPITS.

I'M NERVOUS.

HELLO.

575
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,324
IF I'M AN ALIEN,

576
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,925
THAT WOULD BE
THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO,

577
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,627
BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE AN ALIEN.

578
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,362
I FEEL LIKE
I'M FROM ANOTHER PLANET.

579
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,232
BUT, YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

580
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,134

- I'M INDIAN?

586
00:17:58,345 --> 00:17:59,779
- NO, WAIT, WAIT.

587
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:00,880
- DO I NEED TO WEAR, LIKE,
THAT CIRCLE

588
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,582
ON MY HEAD NOW?

589
00:18:02,649 --> 00:18:04,884
YOU NEED TO TALK,
YOU KNOW, STUPID,

590
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:07,254
BECAUSE I HAVE NO [bleep] IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

MACEDONIAN ROMANI,

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,510
STOP IT.

STOP.

603

OH, MY GOD.

I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

609
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:41,954
HOW THESE COULD BE
MY RESULTS

610
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:45,692
WHEN I WAS BORN IN CHILE
AND ADOPTED FROM CHILE.

611
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,195
- SOUTH ASIAN,

612
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,863
AND EAST ASIA.

613
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,199

00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,368
ARE YOU SURE
THESE ARE MINE?

616
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,703
I DON'T MIND BEING
PART ASIAN

617
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,205
BECAUSE ASIANS ARE HOT,

618
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:00,873
AND THEY HAVE THAT THIRD MUSCLE
IN THEIR VAGINA,

619
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,108
AND GUYS LIKE THAT,

620
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:03,543
SO I FEEL LIKE
JIONNI'S BLESSED.

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,278
SO I'M NOT FROM CHILE.

622
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,579
- NO, YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN BORN
THERE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN--

623
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,114
- I'M NOT EVEN CHILEAN.

624
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,783
- OKAY.

00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:36,643
- NO, JEWISH IS, LIKE,
A PART OF EUROPE.

637
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:37,744
- DO WE HAVE TO GET MARRIED
IN, LIKE,

638
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:38,745
A TEMPLE OR SOMETHING?

639
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,079
- NO, JIONNI.

OH, MY GOD.

00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,158
IS THIS 100% FACT?
