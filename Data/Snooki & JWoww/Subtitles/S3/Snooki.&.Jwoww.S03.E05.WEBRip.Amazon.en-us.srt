00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,441
I'M BEING VERY OPTIMISTIC
ABOUT THIS THERAPY.

4
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,410

- AND NOT KILL EACH OTHER.

23
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,680
- LOOK HOW DIFFERENT
IT LOOKS.

24
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,182
I'M EXCITED TO EXPERIENCE
THE SHORE.

25
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:49,583
IT'S DEFINITELY
GONNA BE DIFFERENT

26
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,785
FROM LIKE OTHER PAST SUMMERS.

27
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,821
JUST, LIKE,
DOING FUN ACTIVITIES

28
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:55,989
AND REMEMBERING,
BUT NOT GETTING ARREST

29
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,491
- TRUE.

30
00:00:57,491 --> 00:01:00,361
- THIS IS NEW.
THIS USED TO BE THE PIZZA PLACE.

31
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,931
I GUESS...
THEY GOT HURT.

32
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,299
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVEN'T REALLY
SEEN THE BOARDWALK

33
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:06,600
SINCE HURRICANE SANDY HIT.

34
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,237
- OH, MY GOD!

35
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:11,139
SO WALKING OUT TO THE BOARDWALK
WITH JENNI,

36
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:12,506
IT JUST FEELS WEIRD.

37
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,142
LIKE, I ACTUALLY FEEL LIKE

38
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:15,743
I'M WALKING INTO THE SHORE STORE
TO GO TO WORK.

39
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,746
HEY!

45
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,390

61
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,882
- SHE POOPED!
- I DIDN'T POOP.

62
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,550
THE FACT THAT ME AND DANNY
ARE PARENTS,

63
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,018
IT'S [bleep] WEIRD.

64
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,353

00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,197
- OH, LOOK,
THERE'S A FEW RIDES.

72
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,698
LET'S GO ON A SCARY RIDE.

IT MAKES ME NERVOUS.

75
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,703
IS IT TIGHT?
AM I IN?

76
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:16,837

00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:28,682
- JENNI, I CHANGED MY MIND!

85
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,050
I THOUGHT I LIKED RIDES.

86
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,084
I FORGOT.

87
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,353
EVERY TIME
WE WENT ON RIDES HERE,

88
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,954
WE WERE ALL DRUNK.
- YEAH. EXACTLY.

89
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,256

00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:48,996
- AND LOTS OF SHOTS.

118
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,798
- I WAS GONNA SAY I MIGHT
BE PREGNANT, BUT I'M NOT.

119
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:52,666
I'LL BE PREGNANT NEXT...

120
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:54,167
CHRISTMAS.

121
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,903
- WE MIGHT BE PREGNANT.
YOU NEVER KNOW.

122
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,106
- I THINK IT WOULD BE COOL
IF WE WERE BOTH PREGNANT

123
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,974
BY NEXT CHRISTMAS
TOGETHER.

124
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,576
- THAT'S FINE.

125
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:05,012
- NO, YOU'RE SCARED
YOUR BODY'S GONNA CHANGE.

126
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,314
- I WANNA ADOPT.

127
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,581
- WHY DON'T YOU WANNA
HAVE YOUR OWN?

128
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,117
- I DON'T WANNA GET FAT.
- THAT'S SO SELFISH.

129
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,720
YOU'RE NOT READY.
- EXACTLY.

130
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,623
- TONIGHT'S THE PERFECT NIGHT
TO BE HERE THOUGH.

131
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:18,125

132
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:19,960
WHAT?

133
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,329
- HAVE YOU BEEN CHEWING ON 'EM
AND PUTTING IT BACK?

134
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,797
- [laughing]

135
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,334
- I BIT AND I'M LIKE,
THIS ALREADY FEELS CHEWED.

136
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:28,369
- EWW.

137
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,373
STOP.
- IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

138
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,107
WE'VE DONE A LOT WORSE.

139
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:40,414
- * I BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING'S
WRONG WITH YOUR ATTITUDE *

140
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,882
- HEY!

141
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:42,983
- * YOUR ATTITUDE

142
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,385
- I'D BE LATE
FOR MY OWN FUNERAL.

143
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:47,855
SO TODAY ME AND ROGER ARE GONNA
DO INDIVIDUAL THERAPY SESSIONS.

144
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,690
I DID MY HOMEWORK.
- GREAT.

145
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,158
- WELL, "I'M PERFECT"...

146
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:52,426
WAS THE FIRST THING
THAT I WROTE.

147
00:04:52,426 --> 00:04:55,028
AND I HAVE ROGER'S.

148
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,397
OH, WAIT.

149
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,632
- YOU KNOW, I'M MORE OF A GUY
THAT BELIEVES IN JUST...

150
00:04:58,632 --> 00:04:59,967
SAYING IT LIKE IT IS.

151
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:02,436
I'M NOT INTO LIKE
THAT GAME PLAYING THING.

152
00:05:02,436 --> 00:05:04,071
- I CAN ALWAYS TELL
WHEN HE'S ANGRY,

153
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:05,439
BUT HE DOESN'T COMMUNICATE
HE'S ANGRY.

154
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,807
I'M ALWAYS LIKE
"WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

155
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,041
"WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

156
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,910
"I CAN SEE IN YOUR FACE
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

157
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,379
BUT YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME."

158
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,146
- ISSUES I WISH
JENNI WOULD WORK ON--

159
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,215
NO PARTICULAR ORDER.

160
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,385
JENNI WILL NOT LET ME
IN HER [bleep]HOLE.

161
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:18,886
- SEX.
- SEX.

162
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,220
- ROMANCE.

163
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,489
HE'S NOT VERY AFFECTIONATE.

164
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,557
WHICH, TO HIM, MEANS SEX.

165
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:24,758
- YES.

166
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,994
- THIS INCLUDES THINGS
LIKE THE DIRTY [bleep],

167
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,261
THE ALABAMA CRAB DANGLE.

168
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,497
- I WANT
LIKE HUGS AND KISSES.

169
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,899
- STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE,
[bleep].

170
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:33,534
- AND I WANT HIM
TO LISTEN TO ME.

171
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,102
- FISH-HOOKING AND [bleep]...

172
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:37,805
ONLY IN STATES WHERE THEY
ARE NOT CLASS "A" FELONIES.

173
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,040
- YOU'VE LOST ME.

174
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:45,145
- * I WANT IT PERFECT

175
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:48,315
- THIS IS HOW MOMMY GOT DADDY
TO NOTICE HER AT THE CLUB.

176
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:50,651
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM,
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

177
00:05:50,651 --> 00:05:52,586
AND THEN SHE WENT,
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM,

178
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:54,688
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM,
BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

179
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,257
AND THEN DADDY WAS LIKE,
"HEY, GIRL."

180
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,492
- [laughs]
- [laughs]

181
00:05:58,492 --> 00:05:59,660
ISN'T THAT FUNNY?

182
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,595
- I CAME OVER TO YOU?
- YEAH.

183
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,263
- WHY DON'T YOU RETELL THE STORY
THE RIGHT WAY?

184
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,332
- YOU TELL HIM THE STORY.
HE WANTS TO KNOW.

185
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,001
- YOUR MOM CAME UP TO ME
WITH HER EYES CROSSED,

186
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,670
NOT KNOWING
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

187
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,304
THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

188
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,473
- IF YOU'RE GONNA
TELL THE STORY,

189
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,807
TELL OUR LITTLE BOY
THE RIGHT--

190
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,643
- OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

191
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,144
- WE MADE OUT.

192
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,846
- IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

193
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,313
- THEN YOU KISSED ANOTHER BOY
AFTER YOU WERE DONE KISSING ME.

194
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,282
- STOP IT.
LORENZO, THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

195
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,684
- YOU WERE SINGLE.

196
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,519
- I KISSED ANOTHER GIRL TOO.
- JIONNI!

197
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,821
- I'M JUST KIDDING.

198
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,957
[farts]
- DID YOU FART?

199
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:31,592
- [laughing]
- EWW!

200
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,994
- [farts]
- OH, MY GOD!

201
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,262
ARE YOU KIDDING?
- MY STOMACH HURTS.

202
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,464
- OH, GET OUTTA HERE!

203
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,131
- [laughs]
- YEAH!

204
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,468
LORENZO.
- I'M GONNA GO CHANGE.

205
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:42,369
- YEAH, YOU BETTER CHANGE
YOUR UNDERWEAR TOO.

206
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:43,904
YOU STINKY BASTARD!

207
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,607
- OH, MY GOD!
MY FARTS ARE SO LETHAL.

208
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:53,847
- BABE.

209
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:57,050
WILL YOU ALLOW ME
TO ADOPT A BABY?

210
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,821
- WAIT A MINUTE.

211
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,491
- ME AND ROGER ALWAYS WANTED
TO HAVE BIOLOGICAL KIDS.

212
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,793
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF ADOPTING

213
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:07,160
BECAUSE NICOLE WAS ADOPTED
FROM CHILE

214
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,496
AND MY MOM WAS ADOPTED.

215
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:09,830
I JUST DON'T KNOW
THE PROCESS.

216
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,499
- JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR ON THAT,

217
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:16,369
WE ARE SIMPLY LOOKING INTO IT
AS A POSSIBLE FUTURE ENDEAVOR

218
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,971
THAT WE MIGHT WANNA...
TACKLE.

219
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,940
WE'RE NOT LOOKING
TO ACTUALLY ADOPT ANYTIME SOON,

220
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,108
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

221
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,409
WE WANNA HAVE
OUR OWN CHILDREN FIRST, CORRECT?

222
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:24,578
- WHATEVER COMES FIRST.
I MEAN...

223
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:26,514
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"WHATEVER COMES FIRST"?

224
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,181
- WE CAN START TRYING
TO HAVE OUR OWN CHILDREN, BUT--

225
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,717
- TONIGHT?

226
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:31,719
- I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU
RIGHT IN THE [bleep].

227
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:34,522
RIGHT IN THE [bleep].

228
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:36,389
- THERE ARE SUCH THING
AS ADOPTION FAIRS.

229
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,825
- THERE ARE?
- MM-HMM.

230
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:40,260
- WHAT DO THEY ENTAIL?
- HA.

231
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,895
FIRST THING THAT COMES UP

232
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,765
IS "ADOPTION FAIRS
ARE SPEED DATING FOR KIDS."

233
00:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,535
- I DON'T WANNA SPEED DATE
FOR A CHILD.

234
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:49,269
- WELL, THERE'S AN AGENCY
ON HERE

235
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,639
THAT WILL ALLOW US
TO SIGN UP

236
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,341
AND DO LIKE AN ADOPTION PICNIC
WITH FAMILIES

237
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,009
WHO HAVE ADOPTED CHILDREN.

238
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,878
- I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT.

239
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,947
- YOU WANNA CONTACT THIS AGENCY?
- YEAH.

240
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,415
OWWW!
- OH!

241
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,686
I SAW THAT HAPPEN
IN SLOW MOTION.

242
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,255
[laughing]

243
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:11,559
- OWWW!
- OH!

244
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:14,161
THAT LOOKED LIKE IT HURT.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

245
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,663
- I WANNA--I WANNA PUNCH A WALL
RIGHT NOW.

246
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,265
[laughter]

247
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,700
- IN THE HAIRLINE?
- I HIT THE CORNER!

248
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,635
- IN THE HAIRLINE,
OR IN THE--

249
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,237
- IT'S RIGHT ON MY FOREHEAD.
IT'S ABOVE MY EYE.

250
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,639
- OH, THAT'S GONNA
LEAVE A MARK.

251
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,274
LET ME GET YOU SOME ICE.
- OHH!

252
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,176
IS THERE ARE A MARK?

253
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,711
- YES.

254
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,279
- IS THERE REALLY?
- YES.

255
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,881
- IT HURTS!

256
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:35,148
- IT'S A TINY LITTLE MARK,

257
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,617
BUT THERE'S A LITTLE PIECE
OF SKIN MISSING.

258
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,351
LITTLE TINY PIECE.
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

259
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,121
- WHO PUTS A CORNER THERE?
- DON'T KNOW.

260
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,590
SORRY.

261
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,258
YOU DID THAT TO YOURSELF.
[laughing]

262
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,728
- I ALWAYS HIT MY HEAD.
THIS IS WHY I'M BRAIN DAMAGED.

263
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,229
- I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY
THAT HITS THEIR HEAD

264
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,599
MORE THAN YOU DO.
- IT HURTS.

265
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,475
- [burps]

266
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:07,314
"HOW TO PLAN A WEDDING".

267
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:09,883
OH, MY GOD.
THIS LOOKS LIKE A LOT OF WORK.

268
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,453
MEET CATERERS,
PURCHASE A DRESS.

269
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,255
REGISTER.

270
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,523

271
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,158
THAT I'M GONNA START PLANNING
MY WEDDING.

272
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,660
AND I'M REALLY REALLY
EXCITED,

273
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,629
BUT I'M HOPING I DON'T BE
A STRESSED-OUT BRIDE

274
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:24,632
BECAUSE I WANT EVERYTHING
TO JUST BE HAPPY AND FUN.

275
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:26,366
BUT I MEAN, ALL THE BRIDES
THAT I TALKED TO,

276
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:27,635
THEY'RE [bleep] MISERABLE.

277
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,302
RESERVE GUEST ACCOMMODATIONS.

278
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,271
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

279
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,206
REGISTRY...
[burps]

280
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,775

UGH!

281
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,644
THIS IS SO ANNOYING.

282
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:39,647
THIS IS TOO MUCH [bleep].
I NEED HELP.

283
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:42,382
CASTLE COUTURE.

284
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,085
PRETTY!

285
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,954
THESE ARE LIKE CLASSY.

286
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:49,356
THE WHOLE WEDDING PROCESS
AND BEING STRESSED

287
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:52,392
IS JUST LIKE PLANNING
THE FLOWERS AND THE GUEST LISTS

288
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:53,994
AND SEATING PEOPLE.

289
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:55,528
THAT'S, LIKE,
THE ANNOYING PART.

290
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,297
THE DRESS PART
IS THE FUN PART.

291
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,266
THIS IS MY WEDDING JESUS.

292
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,401

IT'S BECAUSE I'M WEAK *

296
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:11,679
- HELLO?
- JOEY!

297
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,080
- HEY, GIRL.

298
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,282
- ME AND JENNI WERE GOING
WEDDING DRESS SHOPPING

299
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,484
AND WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
A FABULOUS IDEA

300
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,286
IF WE INVITED OUR JOEYS.

301
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,587
- OH, FUN!

302
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,123
- WILL YOU JUDGE US
AND TRY ON DRESSES WITH US?

303
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,358

00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:29,930
- LOVE YOU.
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU, BYE!

307
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,364
- BYE!

308
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,366
- THERE IS NOTHING
LIKE A GAY MAN'S OPINION.

309
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,002
- OH, I TOTALLY AGREE.

310
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:36,837

326
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,934
- PROBABLY NEXT YEAR,
LIKE AROUND THE FALL TIME.

327
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,969
I FEEL LIKE I'M A VIRGIN
TO EVERYTHING.

328
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,938
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO LOOK FOR.

329
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,272
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START.

330
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:14,074
AND HOPEFULLY THE PEOPLE
AT THIS PLACE

331
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,075
ARE GOING TO HELP ME.

332
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:16,543

333
00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:18,311
JENNI!

334
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,147
- OH, MY GOD!

335
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,649
- WHO IS THAT FOR?
- THAT'S FOR ANYBODY.

336
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,018
- I WANT MY THEME
TO BE BLACK AND GOLD.

337
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,419
- OH, THIS IS PERFECT.
- BEAUTIFUL.

338
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,555
- BUT I DON'T KNOW YET.
IT COULD BE LEOPARD.

339
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,758
- [bleep].
- LIKE A SEXY, LIKE...

340
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,225
- THERE'S NOTHING SEXY
ABOUT STANDING UP THERE

341
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,526
IN A LEOPARD DRESS.

342
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,395
I MEAN, THERE'S SEXY.

00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,263
I'M BUYING THE DRESS!

513
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,931
- OH, MY GOD!
- YAY!

514
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,100
- I'M GETTIN' MARRIED.

515
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,635
I WAS NOT EXPECTING
TO GO TO THIS PLACE

516
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:16,836
AND FIND A WEDDING DRESS.

517
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:20,173
IT WAS MORE OF LIKE
TO HAVE FUN WITH MY BOO,

518
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,241
SO IT'S CRAZY
THAT I FOUND IT.

519
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,376
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I FOUND MY DRESS.

520
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,778
- IT WAS OUR PLEASURE.
CONGRATULATIONS.

521
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:27,480
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

522
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,581
TAKE CARE.

523
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:29,916
- I THINK I RIPPED
LIKE THREE DRESSES.

524
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,118
[laughter]

525
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,519
BUT I GAVE THEM
YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION,

526
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,287
SO IT SHOULD BE FINE.
- OH, THAT'S FABULOUS.

527
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:39,259
- * I DON'T WANNA STAY
THIS WAY FOREVER *

528
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:42,295
* ARE YOU READY TO...

529
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,931
- OPEN YOUR EYES!
- [laughing]

530
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,866
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

531
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:48,501
DID YOU FIND
WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR?

532
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,702
- I FOUND MY DRESS.

533
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,738
- OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HER.

534
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,141
I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU FOUND IT.
THAT'S THE FIRST STEP.

535
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,876
- AND I FEEL LIKE A PRINCESS.
- YOU'RE GONNA LOOK LIKE ONE.

536
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,145
- MM.

537
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:01,248
OH, THE JOEYS CAME.
- OH, MY GOD.

538
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,582
- MY JOEY TRIED ON A DRESS.

539
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,651
- DID BEAR?
- YEAH.

540
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:07,154
HE LOOKED LIKE THE FAT GIRL
AT PROM.

541
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,255
- WITH THAT BEARD?
- YES.

542
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,157
- THAT SOUNDS REALLY GAY.

543
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:11,891
- IT WAS.
- [laughing]

544
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,726
- IT WAS VERY GAY.

545
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,162
JENNI TRIED ON
THE DRESSES TOO.

546
00:18:15,162 --> 00:18:17,730
- JENNI TRIED ON DRESSES?
- YEAH.

547
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,266
SHE WANTS TO GET MARRIED NOW,

548
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,833
BUT SHE'S SCARED TO TELL ROGER

549
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,602
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T KNOW
HOW ROGER'S GONNA REACT.

550
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,771
SO NOW JENNI WANTS TO PLAN
A WEDDING I THINK.

551
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,807
- I WANNA BE AT THAT WEDDING.
[laughs]

552
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,442
- THEY NEED JESUS.

553
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,444
I FEEL LIKE JENNI DOES
WANNA GET MARRIED,

554
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,446
BUT THEN LIKE THE NEXT DAY
SHE DOESN'T.

555
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,914
I MEAN, SHE JUST ALWAYS
CHANGES HER MIND.

556
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,883
- IT'S NOT SOMETHING
YOU CAN BE CONFUSED ABOUT.

557
00:18:36,883 --> 00:18:38,318
YOU EITHER WANNA DO IT
OR YOU DON'T.

558
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,620
- AND I WANNA MARRY YOU.
- ME TOO.

559
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,055
WELL, YOU.

560
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:46,626
OOH!
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED!

561
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,630
- LET'S GO WAKE UP
THE DADDY.

562
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,433
I'M IN A VERY PSYCHEDELIC STAGE
RIGHT NOW

563
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,701
BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA
GET MARRIED,

564
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:55,935
BUT NOW I WANNA GET MARRIED.

565
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,937
SO YEAH, TWILIGHT ZONE.

566
00:18:57,937 --> 00:19:00,207
- YOU HAVE FUN?

567
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:01,841
- UM, IT WENT
LIKE I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO GO.

568
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:03,210
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

569
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,545
- [whispering]
I TRIED ON DRESSES.

570
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:09,416
- REALLY.

571
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,751
- IT WAS LIKE...
- FELT LIKE A PRINCESS?

572
00:19:11,751 --> 00:19:14,120
- YEAH.
- [laughing]

573
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,724
- WHAT?

574
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,327
- YOU'RE OKAY.
YOU CAN FEEL LIKE A PRINCESS.

575
00:19:20,327 --> 00:19:22,128
I FELT PRETTY...

576
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,563
IN ALL THE DRESSES.
- YOU ARE PRETTY.

577
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,532
YOU ARE PRETTY.
MY LITTLE PRINCESS.

578
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,899
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

579
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,735
IT MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANNA
GET MARRIED NOW YOU MEAN?

580
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:30,270
- MAYBE.

581
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,139
- I'M PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.
AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT.

582
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,141
I JUST WANT THE BEST FOR US,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

583
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:36,409
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
THAT MOMENT.

584
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,579
I HOPE THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING
WITH THERAPY

585
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,714
AND WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP
GETS US THERE ONE DAY.

586
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,149
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT,

587
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,551
BUT I WANT YOU TO SUPPORT
WHAT I WANT.

588
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,253
THAT'S ALL.
- I DO SUPPORT WHAT YOU WANT.

589
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,121
- IT'S GREAT THAT ROGER FEELS
THE WAY THAT HE DOES.

590
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,490
HE HAS MY FULL SUPPORT,

591
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,660
COMING HOME AND FEELING
THE WAY THAT I DO RIGHT

592
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,595
- YOU HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT
YOU MEAN.

593
00:19:55,595 --> 00:19:56,763
- HUH?

594
00:19:56,763 --> 00:19:58,265
- YOU SAID
"HE HAS MY FULL SUPPORT."

595
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,933
YOU HAVE MY FULL SUPPORT
YOU MEANT TO SAY, RIGHT?

596
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,902
I WOULD LOVE TO MAKE YOU
A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS ONE DAY.

597
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,937
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT MAYBE NEXT YEAR?

598
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,873
- I THINK THAT'S
A DEFINITE POSSIBILITY, YEAH.

599
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:10,677
- I'M SO GLAD
THAT ROGER'S SUPPORTING ME.

600
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,044
NO, I DID IT WRONG AGAIN?
I [bleep] DON'T KNOW.

601
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,580
- JUST HIT IT AGAIN.

602
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,748
- I DON'T WANT SUPPORT ANYMORE
IN THIS [bleep] CONVERSATION.

603
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,083
- YOU SOUND LIKE
YOU HAD A GREAT NIGHT.

604
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,151
- I DID.
I ALMOST CRIED WHEN I SAW HER.

605
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,987
- THE MOOD IS GOOD RIGHT NOW,
YOU KNOW?

606
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,491
MAYBE IT'S SETTING THE TONE
FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.

607
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,992
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BABE?

608
00:20:25,992 --> 00:20:29,562
- I HAVE GAS.
- OKAY.

609
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,299
- BABE, I'M DISABLED.
I HAVE A BAD INJURY.

610
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,066
- ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT GONNA RUIN
THIS BEAUTIFUL NIGHT

611
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,435
BY HUMPING YOU.
- THANK YOU.

612
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,606
- IS THIS THE FRONT DOOR?

613
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:40,640
- YEAH, THIS IS
YOUR FRONT ENTRANCE.

614
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,808
- WE'RE BUILDING A HOUSE.

615
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:42,875
WE CAN DESIGN IT
HOWEVER WE WANT.

616
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:44,043
- [screams]

617
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:45,512
- I'M NERVOUS.
- LET'S GO ADOPT A BABY.

618
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,480
WE'RE NOT PARENTS,
WE'VE NEVER ADOPTED A CHILD.

619
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,182
- I WOULD LOVE TO GIVE A CHILD
THAT SAME LOVE AND CARE THAT,

620
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:51,884
YOU KNOW, MY BEST FRIEND
AND I HAVE.

621
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,053
- HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
THE TYPE OF CEREMONY?

622
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,922
- I'M SO CONFUSED.
- [laughing]

623
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,189
- WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WE'RE DOING.
