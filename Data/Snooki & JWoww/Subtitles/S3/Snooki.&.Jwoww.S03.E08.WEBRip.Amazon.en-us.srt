00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:04,705
- MY FAVORITE DRESS
I'M FINALLY TRYING ON,

2
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:06,140
AND I HAVE GOOSE BUMPS.

3
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:08,209
- DO YOU? [gasps]

4
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:11,079
YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED?

5
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:12,580
NO?

6
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:14,882
OH, YOU WANT TO GET MARRIED.
ARE YOU GONNA CRY?

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:16,217
- ROGER'S GONNA KILL ME.

8
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:17,718
- I KNOW THAT I NEED
TO WORK ON ROMANCE.

9
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:20,821
I KNOW THAT, BUT I JUST
WOULD LIKE TO WALK IN THE ROOM

10
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,723
AND PULL JENNI'S SKIRT DOWN

11
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,392
AND RAVAGE HER.
- UGH.

12
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,659
- I FEEL LIKE
SINCE I'M FROM CHILE,

13
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,261
I FEEL LIKE I AM CHILEAN...
- YEAH.

14
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:30,798
- BUT, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW,
SO I'M GONNA GET A DNA TEST.

15
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,765
[Icona Pop's I Love It]

16
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,267
- * I DON'T CARE *

17
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:34,602
* I LOVE IT *

18
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:36,570
* I DON'T CARE *

19
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,572
* I LOVE IT,
I LOVE IT *

20
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,674
* I DON'T CARE *

21
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,243
* I LOVE IT *

22
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,644
* *

23
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,579
* I DON'T CARE *

24
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:49,850
- * BA BA BA-DA-DA-DA
WHAT DO YOU SAY? *

25
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:52,886
- MOMMY IS GONNA GO
FIND OUT WHAT SHE IS TODAY.

26
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,355
[Lorenzo yells]
SHE IS--

27
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,023
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO?

28
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,360
SINCE I'M ADOPTED,
I REALLY WANT TO GET A DNA TEST.

29
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:01,762
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT I AM,
SO I CAN TELL MY SON

30
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:03,831
ONE DAY WHAT HE IS.

31
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,899
YOU READY TO FIND OUT
WHAT WE ARE?

32
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,136
IF WE'RE ALIENS

33
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,770
OR WEIRDOS

34
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,472
OR A SPIDER?

35
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,874
IMAGINE IF WE WERE
LIKE SPIDER-MAN.

36
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,545
[Lorenzo laughs]

37
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,614
COULD BE DIFFERENT THINGS,
WHICH IS COOL.

38
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,151
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, I GOOGLED
WHAT CHILEAN PEOPLE LOOK LIKE,

39
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,718
AND THEY ALL LOOK LIKE ME.

40
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,521
LIKE, LITTLE [bleep]
SHORT [bleep] WALKING AROUND.

41
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,491
IT'S NOT BLOOD WORK, RIGHT?
- NO BLOOD WORK.

42
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:32,660
[laughs] SO RELAX.
- IT DOESN'T HURT?

43
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:34,162
- IT DOESN'T HURT.
- OKAY.

44
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:36,864
- WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING
FOR NATIVE AMERICAN ONE,

45
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,168
NATIVE AMERICAN TWO,
JEWISH ONE, JEWISH TWO,

46
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,835
JEWISH THREE,
AND JEWISH FOUR.

47
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:45,406
- YOU CAN TELL IF YOU'RE JEWISH?
- MM-HMM.

48
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:46,840
- HOW DO YOU FIND OUT
IF YOU'RE JEWISH?

49
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:49,510
I FEEL LIKE
THAT'S, LIKE, A RELIGION,

50
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,612
AND YOU PICK
WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN,

51
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:55,716
SO I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE BORN, LIKE, JEWISH.

52
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:57,318
I'M NOT JEWISH.
I'M CHRISTIAN.

53
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,621
CATHOLIC?
ARE THEY THE SAME THINGS?

54
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,790
I'M CATHOLIC.

55
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,359
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT
I COULD BE FROM ANOTHER PLANET,

56
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:09,197
LIKE I'M AN ALIEN.

57
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,399
- WELL, YOU COULD ALWAYS BE
FROM MARS, WE NEVER KNOW.

58
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,434
MAYBE WE'LL FIND OUT.
- I FEEL LIKE I'M AN ALIEN.

59
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:15,869
- SOMETIMES, WE ALL FEEL
LIKE WE'RE ALIENS.

60
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,272
[laughs]
- YEAH.

61
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:22,075
- OKAY, OPEN UP.

62
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,644
[Lorenzo babbling]

63
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:25,679
- WOULD YOU TELL THE FBI,
THEN THEY WOULD TAKE ME AWAY,

64
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,215
OR WOULD YOU JUST
LET ME LIVE?

65
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:28,549
I MEAN,
I WATCH A LOT OF MOVIES,

66
00:02:28,616 --> 00:02:29,783
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS.

67
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,818
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THEY'RE ALIENS,

68
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,220
THEY FIND OUT THEY'RE ALIENS,

69
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:35,856
AND THE GOVERNMENT
JUST ANAL-PROBES YOU.

70
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,558
- PROMISE YOU,
THEY'RE NOT GONNA FIND OUT.

71
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:39,026
[laughs]

72
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:42,563
- * BROTHER, HEAR ME NOW,
IT'S NOT OUR TOWN *

73
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,934
- SO BRING ME UP TO DATE.
WHERE DO WE STAND ON INTIMACY?

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,870
I LIKE THE TERM "MAKING LOVE."

75
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,406
- MAKING--I DO TOO.
- EW.

76
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:57,245
- IT'S THE PROCESS THAT CAN
CONSUMMATE IN THE SEXUAL ACT,

77
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:01,615
BUT YOU GO THROUGH THE KISSING,
TAKING IT SLOW TO TOUCHING.

78
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,984
- CARESSING.
GENTLE CARESSES.

79
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,254
- THE WHOLE CARESSING
AND EVERYTHING

80
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:07,755
IS REALLY WEIRD FOR ME,
I'M GONNA BE HONEST.

81
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:10,458
- BUT IT IS--THAT IS PASSION.
THAT IS--

82
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,659
- BUT YOU JUST LOOK LIKE
A PERVERT.

83
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,993
- HOW ELSE WOULD I DO IT?

84
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,095
- I FELT LIKE
AN OLD MAN IS TOUCHING ME.

85
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,964
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO SHOW YOU AFFECTION?

86
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,999
- I JUST WANT YOU TO GIVE ME
MORE HUGS AND KISSES,

87
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,269
FLOWERS,
BE MORE "ATTENTATIVE,"

88
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,271
PLAY WITH OUR DOGS MORE.
- "ATTENTATIVE"?

89
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:24,838
- ATTENTIVE, SHE MEANT.
- ATTENTIVE.

90
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:26,974
LIKE, I'M NERVOUS NOW.
YOU MADE ME--

91
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,876
I'M CLAMMY RIGHT NOW.

92
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,544
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SEX
WITH ME FOUR TIMES A DAY.

93
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,912
HOW ABOUT ONCE A WEEK?
- NO.

94
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,481
- AND THAT'S FINE...
- WHEN IS THAT FINE?

95
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,783
- BUT IF YOU ACTUALLY KISSED ME
AND HUGGED ME

96
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,518
AND DONE NICE THINGS FOR ME
AND TO BE, LIKE--

97
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,119
AND JUST A PECK, LIKE...
[kisses]

98
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:42,990
"HOW WAS WORK?
OKAY, BYE, I'M GONE."

99
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,191
THIS DOES NOT MEAN
YOU GET LAID RIGHT NOW.

100
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,759
- [whistles] NO?

101
00:03:45,826 --> 00:03:49,297
I NEED TO KNOW ON MY END,
THOUGH,

102
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,532
THAT, LIKE, YOUR LOINS
STILL BURN AND YEARN FOR ME.

103
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,667
- CAN YOU N--
SEE, THIS IS--

104
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,136
YOU DON'T KNOW ROGER
WHERE I KNOW HIM.

105
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,638
LOOK AT HIS SMIRK.

106
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:00,308
- NO, I'M NOT--YOU'RE SMIRKING.
- BABE? B--YES.

107
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:01,975
BECAUSE YOU'RE MAKING IT
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE IN HERE.

108
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,744
- NO, I'M TAKING THIS
VERY SERIOUS.

109
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:07,515
THIS IS OUR LIVES,
AND I WANT THE PASSION BACK.

110
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,150
- THAT HAS TO BE APPROACHED
BY MAKING HER FEEL COMFORTABLE,

111
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,985
MAKING HER FEEL LOVED,
MAKING HER FEEL SPECIAL.

112
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,154
- EXACTLY,
LIKE A KOALA IN A ZOO.

113
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,757
- [laughs]

114
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:18,392
- YOU'RE MAKING THIS SO AWKWARD.

115
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,861
- NO, YOU HAVE TO--
- [laughs]

116
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,030
- AND YOU NEED TO JUST
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

117
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,966
- THIS IS VIOLENCE!
THIS IS SETTING US BACK!

118
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,936
- GUYS, OKAY.
- IT'S SETTING US BACK MILES.

119
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,972
SHE HURTS ME, DOCTOR.
- HE DOESN'T REALIZE

120
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,741
THAT I'M DOING THIS OUT OF LOVE.
- I'M DYING.

121
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:37,678
OW, AH! THAT HURT.
IT--SHE HURTS ME.

122
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,647
[grunts]

123
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,383
- SO THIS CAN'T BE PUSHED
AND RUSHED AT THIS POINT.

124
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,751
SHE'S LOOKING FOR AFFECTION.
- AFFECTION.

125
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,686
- MAYBE SOME MASSAGING.
- YES.

126
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:49,757
MAYBE A HOT OIL MASSAGE
TONIGHT WOULD BE A GOOD--

127
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,258
- NO.
- THINK WE'VE LOST

128
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:52,893
SOME OF THE ATMOSPHERE
FOR TONIGHT.

129
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,261
- YEAH.
- POSSIBLY TOMORROW?

130
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:56,129
I THINK MY INTIMACY
COMES ACROSS AS A JOKE

131
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,966
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN
A ROMANTIC GUY.

132
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,835
DEFINITELY THINKING
WHAT I NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW

133
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:03,804
TO BRING THAT SPARK AND THAT
ROMANCE BACK TO MY RELATIONSHIP

134
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,407
IS TO SPICE THINGS UP,
TO MAKE JENNI FEEL BEAUTIFUL,

135
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,175
AND TO BE
A BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS.

136
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,378
- AND WE'LL GET TOGETHER
AGAIN SOON.

137
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,845
- YES.
- THANK YOU.

138
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,246
- GREAT TO SEE YOU.
- CLOTHES ON OR CLOTHES OFF

139
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:14,848
NEXT TIME?
- [scoffs] I'M--

140
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,450
- WHAT?

141
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:24,392
[phone ringing]

142
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:27,728
- YO!
MY MAN, WHAT'S UP?

143
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,162
- SO YOU KNOW
HOW WE'RE IN THERAPY.

144
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,599
MY LAST SESSION,
BASICALLY, WE KIND OF HAD

145
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,101
A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAKTHROUGH
THAT I NEED TO BE MORE ROMANTIC

146
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,836
IN THE RELATIONSHIP,
SO I WAS THINKING

147
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,838
ABOUT TRYING TO COOK HER DINNER.
CAN YOU HELP ME?

148
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,940
- I'LL DO ANYTHING TO HELP YOU,
MY FRIEND.

149
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,409
MAKE IT
A LITTLE DOUBLE DATE.

150
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,643
- ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.
I APPRECIATE IT.

151
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,211
- YOU GOT IT, PAL.
I'LL TALK TO YOU.

152
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,079
- I'M TRYING TO PAY ATTENTION
TO WHAT I'M LEARNING IN THERAPY.

153
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,716
I'VE NEVER, LIKE, MADE A MEAL
FROM SCRATCH FOR JENNI,

154
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,551
AND, YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT'S TIME.

155
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:53,153
[exhales]
LET'S DO THIS.

156
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,627
[phone ringing]

157
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,529
- HEY, HEY.

158
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,763
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

159
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,965
- I JUST GOT BACK
FROM DOGGY DAY CARE,

160
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:09,102
AND, OH, MY GOD,
I SAW THE CUTEST FLYER THERE.

161
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,906
IT'S, LIKE, A DOGGY
CHARITY WASH OUTSIDE,

162
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,943
AND IT'S FOR TOMS RIVER
ANIMAL SHELTER,

163
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,446
SO IT'S LIKE
ALL THE DONATIONS GO THERE.

164
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:21,449
I DIDN'T KNOW IF YOU WOULD BE
DOWN TO, LIKE, WASH DOGS.

165
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:23,584
- I'M DOWN.
YOU KNOW I LOVE DOGGIES.

166
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:27,320
I'LL MAKE SOME SIGNS FOR US.
- YAY.

167
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,696
YAY!

BEFORE?

335
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,875
- LET ME SEE.

336
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,143

RIGHT HERE, CORRECT?

337
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:26,947

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

THE BACKBONE.

344
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,227
- FOLLOW THE BACKBONE.

345
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:43,196
NICE, OH, THAT'S A GOOD CUT.

JIONNI'S ON THE STOVE,
HE'S COOKING.

362
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,534
I MIGHT AS WELL TAKE
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GO IN

363
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,936
AND SET UP THE DINING ROOM.

364
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,637

GET THE FLOWERS SET UP,
GET THE CANDLES SET UP

366
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,875
TO KIND OF SET THE AMBIANCE.

368
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,444

AFTER I COOK THE SOUFFLE,
I'M SOUFFLE-ING MYSELF.

376
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:52,199

VERY LITTLE HOPE

377
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,501

00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,796
JIONNI AND I ARE BOTH
IN THE KITCHEN.

405
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:59,967
NICOLE IS FIRST
THROUGH THE ENTRYWAY, AND--

00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,301

00:15:15,682 --> 00:15:17,050
- AND MY THERAPIST SAYS
THAT I NEED TO BE ROMANTIC.

415
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:18,485
- OH, MY GOD.

416
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:20,287
- WE'RE GONNA GET CHANGED,
SO WE DON'T STINK.

417
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:22,555

00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:49,449
- OKAY, WE'LL SAY,
"CHICKEN POULET BASQUAISE."

432
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:52,252
- NO, THAT WOULD BE
"CHICKEN CHICKEN," IDIOT.

433

[horn blares]

434
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,822
- DOES THAT MEAN DINNER?
IS THAT OUR COW BELL?

435
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:59,292
THIS DEFINITELY MAKES ME WANT TO

436
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,793
SO WHEN WE GET BACK HOME,

437

I LOVE IT.

454
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,460
- IT'S AN ORGANIC CHICKEN.

455
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:35,062
- I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT BAD.

456
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,596
- I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S GOOD.
- I THINK IT'S DELICIOUS.

457
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,730
- CHICKEN'S A LITTLE DRY,
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO LONG, BUT--

458
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:39,066
- I DON'T EVEN THINK
IT'S DRY AT ALL.

459
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:40,367
- IT'S NOT DRY AT ALL.
- IT'S SO GOOD.

460
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,368
- IT WAS PERFECT.

461
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,535
- IT'S GOOD?

462
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,504
- WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?
- YEAH.

463
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,340
- IT WAS MORE--
ROGER WAS DOING IT FOR JENNI.

464
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,276
HE WAS, BUT THEN HE SAID--
- AW!

465
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,810
- OH, THANKS, BABY.
- HE WAS.

466
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,246
- I INVITED JIONNI TO COME OVER
AND GIVE ME A HAND,

467
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,482
BECAUSE HE'S A LITTLE BIT
BETTER, YOU KNOW, COOK.

468
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:56,849
- THEN HE SAID,
"CAN YOU HELP ME?

469
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,152
'CAUSE I KNOW
THEY'LL BE TOGETHER," SO...

470
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,454

00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:04,091

THE CHOCOLAT AU SOUFFLE.

474
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,732
JIONNI, COME HERE.

475
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,801
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

476
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,103
- GOOD.

477
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:18,838
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA EAT
FOR DESSERT?

478
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,308
- I DON'T NEED ONE.
- [laughs]

479
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,009
- WE'LL SPLIT IT, NO.

480
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,377
WE HAD FOUR...
- NO, I KNOW.

481
00:17:24,444 --> 00:17:25,545
- ALL SITTING HERE TOGETHER.
- YOU COULD--

482
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:26,813
- WHY DID YOU LEAVE
THIS ONE OUT?

483
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,947
- 'CAUSE THE GUY WANTED IT
IN THE MIDDLE.

484
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:28,848
- DOESN'T MATTER.
THEY WOULD HAVE FIT.

485
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,117
IT'S STILL IN THE MIDDLE.

486
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,551
YOU [bleep] UP,
AND YOU'RE LYING.

487
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:32,852
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M LYING?
- ADMIT YOU [bleep] UP.

488
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:33,886

489
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,122
YOU FORGOT ONE.

00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,623
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- [laughs]

491
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,695
- THERE'S MORE SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW
ON THE WAY.

492
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,631
- AND IT CONTINUES NOW.

493
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:48,301
- * NOBODY LIKES A SAD SONG *

494
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,002
- YOU [bleep] UP,
AND YOU'RE LYING.

495
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,304
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, I'M LYING?
- ADMIT YOU [bleep] UP.

496
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:52,239
- I PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE.

00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,706
YOU FORGOT ONE.

498
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:54,741
- I KNOW THERE'S FOUR OF US,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:56,176
ROGER,
YOU CAN HAVE MY SOUFFLE.

500
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,044
I'M GETTING MY SOUFFLE
BACK AT THE HOUSE.

501
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:02,149
NOW, LADIES, THIS IS
THE SOUFFLE "CHOC-LETTE."

502
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,217
NOW, I'VE NEVER MADE
A DESSERT BEFORE.

503
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,585
- WE CAN SHARE, LITTLE BUDDY,
'CAUSE WE--

504
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,154
- YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA EAT--
TRUST ME.

505
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:08,288
- NO, I'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT
OF IT WITH YOU, AND THEN,

506
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,489
WHEN THE OTHER ONE'S DONE--
- WHY?

507
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:10,857
- 'CAUSE I-I--
- NO, I'M REALLY FULL.

508
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,259
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.
- YOU ONLY COULD FIT THREE

509
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,660
IN THE PAN,
AND I PUT THREE IN.

510
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,162
THERE'S FOUR OF US.
- THAT'S FINE, I'LL WAIT.

511
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,929
- YOU COULD HAVE FIT,
LIKE, EIGHT IN THE PAN.

512
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,431
- YOU TOLD ME TO PUT 'EM
IN THE MIDDLE.

513
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:20,267
- RIGHT, BUT THERE WAS
PLENTY OF ROOM FOR IT TO GO

514
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,501
IN THE MIDDLE, YOU [bleep].

IT REALLY WAS.

528
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,756
- WE REALLY CAN'T TELL YOU,
JUST IN CASE

529
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:45,292
WE WANT TO SURPRISE YOU AGAIN.
- BABE, NO SECRETS.
