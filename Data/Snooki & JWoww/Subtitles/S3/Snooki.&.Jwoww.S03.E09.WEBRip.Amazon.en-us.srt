00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:41,064
- YEAH, BUDDY.

174
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,515
- I'LL GET IN THERE AND GIVE
THIS LITTLE GIRL A WHIRL.

175
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:45,931
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOTTA MOVE
THAT LEG A LITTLE BIT, GIRL.

176
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,830
- ROGER, SHE LIKES YOU.

177
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:50,142
- I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A GOD-GIVEN
TALENT TO MILK UDDERS.

178
00:05:50,211 --> 00:05:52,697
YOU KNOW, I PRACTICE IT
ROUTINELY ON JENNI.

179
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,215
SHE SEEMS TO REALLY HATE IT,

180
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:57,253
BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE I HAVE
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE HERE.

181
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:58,565
- THERE YOU GO, BABE.

182
00:05:58,634 --> 00:06:00,256
TRY AND GET THE OTHER ONES.

YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN LIKE...

189
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:17,169
- BUT YOU WERE LIKE, "EWW!"
LIKE EVERY GIRL DOES.

190
00:06:17,238 --> 00:06:20,310
- YOU ARE NEVER HAVING SEX
WITH ME EVER AGAIN.

191
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,174
[laughter]

192
00:06:32,737 --> 00:06:34,877
- NICOLE, YOU SHOWERING FIRST?

193
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:37,880
I HOPE THERE'S NO SPIDERS.

194
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,571
I WILL CRY IF I FIND A SPIDER.

195
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,815
[water running]

196
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,928
[screams]

197
00:06:51,997 --> 00:06:54,931

205
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:11,154
- IMAGINE IF NICOLE

206
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,501

[laughs]

00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:25,928
THAT WAS A REAL SCREAM.
- THAT WAS REAL TERROR.

213
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:29,449
THAT WASN'T JUST A FAKE SCREAM.

214
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:30,933
- BE RIGHT BACK.

215
00:07:31,002 --> 00:07:33,349
- ROGE, GREAT PRANK.

216
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,973
YO, YO, YO.

00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,434
- OH, MAN, THESE GIRLS

00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,953
I FEEL LIKE WE COULD SCARE 'EM

223
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:52,989
- PA-POW!

224
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:56,234
- ROGE, WE SHOULD CUT OUR JEANS

226
00:07:57,615 --> 00:08:00,790
WHAT IS THAT?

227
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:02,792

00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:04,622
- WHAT IS THAT?
- I DIDN'T DO IT.

229
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:05,864

00:08:05,933 --> 00:08:06,865
JERKS.

231
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:08,142
- DAMN IT.

232
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:09,799
- YOU'RE GETTING HIT
LEFT AND RIGHT.

233
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:10,869
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT'S UP NEXT FOR ME.

234
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,250
- I'M SCARED.

235
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,769
I HOPE YOU'RE DOING
SOME [bleep] TO HER.

236
00:08:13,838 --> 00:08:15,149
- [bleep] YOU.

237
00:08:15,218 --> 00:08:16,944
- WHAT'D I EVER DO TO YOU,
YOU [bleep]?

238
00:08:22,605 --> 00:08:24,538
- POOP SMELL'S COMING IN
STRONG NOW.

239
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:25,815
WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.

240
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:27,610
- IT'S TIME TO GO
DOWN TO THE STABLES

241
00:08:27,679 --> 00:08:30,510
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA BE
RIDING HORSES,

242
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:31,511
AND I HATE HORSES.

243
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,236
WELL, I DON'T HATE HORSES.

244
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:34,652
IT'S LIKE, I'M TINY,

245
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:36,377
AND THE HORSE COULD
DEFINITELY TAKE ME OUT.

246
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:39,967
I DON'T WANT TO DIE.
MY LIFE IS GOOD RIGHT NOW.

247
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:41,866
- WHOA, WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

248
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:43,488

249
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,317

250
00:08:45,386 --> 00:08:48,355
- DON'T, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T...
- ROGER!

251
00:08:48,424 --> 00:08:49,356
- I DO NOT PLAY AROUND
WITH SPIDERS.

252
00:08:49,425 --> 00:08:50,702
THAT'S MY BIGGEST FEAR.

253
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:53,015
WHEN I SEE A SPIDER
AND I'M AROUND ROGER,

254
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:55,189
WHO I KNOW IS GONNA PICK IT UP,
I'M OUT.

255
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:56,570
ROGER!

256
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,813
- DON'T DO IT TO ME.
DON'T YOU [bleep] DARE.

257
00:08:57,882 --> 00:08:59,539
I'LL BREAK UP WITH YOU.

258
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:02,196
WE WILL NO LONGER BE ENGAGED.
- I'LL KICK YOUR BALL SACK IN.

259
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:03,232
- PLEASE DO.

260
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,889
- DOES HE HAVE IT IN HIS HAND?

261
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,166
- STOP. STOP.

262
00:09:06,235 --> 00:09:07,616
I'M GOING, I'M GOING.

263
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:09,134
OH, MY GOD,
THESE JEANS ARE TOO TIGHT.

264
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:10,929
THESE JEANS ARE TOO TIGHT.
- WHOO! WHOO! [screams]

265
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:11,930

266
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:14,899

267
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,832
MOMMY!

268
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:18,247
- I WANT MY MOM!
I WANT MY MOMMY!

269
00:09:18,316 --> 00:09:20,111
- STOP! STOP!

270
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,491
I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE,
I'M GONNA PUNCH YOU IN THE FACE!

271
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,492
STOP!

272
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,080
- [laughs]

273
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:26,048
- UGH!
[laughter]

274
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:27,739
I HATE ALL OF YOU!

275
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:31,018
I'M REALLY GETTING OVER
YOUR PRANKS.

276
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,295
HONESTLY.

277
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,815
- PA-POW!
- JESUS!

278
00:09:34,884 --> 00:09:35,885
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANT TO DO THIS NOW.

279
00:09:35,954 --> 00:09:37,646
- COME ON.

280
00:09:37,715 --> 00:09:39,164
- BUT DO WE GO ON TRAILS, OR DO
WE JUST GO IN CIRCLES IN HERE?

281
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,338
- WE GO ON TRAILS.

282
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:41,477
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
COME ON IN.

283
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:43,237
- WELCOME BACK.
- I'M SCARED.

284
00:09:43,306 --> 00:09:44,514
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SCARED OF.

285
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,102
- I'M NERVOUS.

286
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,623
- ONE FOOT.

287
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,038
- I'M CONQUERING
A FEAR RIGHT NOW.

288
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:52,626
- ONE, TWO, THREE,
LIKE YOU'RE GETTING ON A BIKE.

289
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,179
ONE, TWO, THREE.
SWING YOUR LEG OVER.

290
00:09:54,248 --> 00:09:55,560
- OH...

291
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,113
OKAY.

292
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:58,598
- I'M NERVOUS.
- IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

293
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,152
- IS THERE A SEATBELT?
- NO. NO SEATBELT.

294
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:02,498
- UH-OH, STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP.
- PULL BACK. PULL BACK.

295
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:03,982
- I DON'T WANT THIS,
I DON'T WANT THIS.

296
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:04,914
- WHOA, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I THINK HE'S JUST THIRSTY.

297
00:10:04,983 --> 00:10:06,364
- HE'S PISSED, HE'S PISSED.

298
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:08,366
- NO, HE'S NOT. HE'S JUST
TRYING TO GET SOME WATER.

299
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:11,024
- NO, NO, NO, STOP, STOP.
[horse whinnies]

300
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:12,404
MY [bleep] HORSE
WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME.

301
00:10:12,473 --> 00:10:14,993
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE
GETTING ON SOMETHING

302
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:15,994
AND IT BASICALLY LOOKS AT YOU
AND GOES, "[bleep] YOU."

303
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:16,995
- OH, YEAH, DEFINITELY.

304
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:19,619
YOU HAD A HORSE THAT IS YOU.

305
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:21,275
- YEAH, IT LITERALLY
SHOOK ITS HEAD AND WAS LIKE,

306
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:22,622
"I'M THIRSTY,
I'M GOING TO GET WATER."

307
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:23,830
- I DO WHAT I WANT.
- YEAH.

308
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:25,452
- THAT'S YOU.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

309
00:10:25,521 --> 00:10:30,077
- HEY, MIKE. DO THEY [bleep]
AND WALK AT THE SAME TIME?

310
00:10:30,146 --> 00:10:31,769
- YES, THEY CAN [bleep]
AND WALK AT THE SAME TIME.

311
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:33,667
- WOW, I CAN DO THAT TOO.

312
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:36,221
- OVER HERE, OVER HERE.
WHEW!

313
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,363
- GOOD GIRL.

314
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:41,951
- I NEED A XANAX.

315
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,160
WE DEFINITELY GOTTA
HAVE A VICTORY DRINK.

316
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:46,715
- NICOLE KILLED IT.
I WAS BEYOND PROUD OF HER.

317
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:48,578
I MEAN, SHE WAS REALLY NERVOUS

318
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,063
AND CONQUERED HER FEAR
RIGHT THEN AND THERE.

319
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:53,238
- WE'RE ALMOST THERE, GUYS.

320
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:55,793
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- THAT WAS SO SWEET.

321
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:57,622
- I WAS PROUD OF YOU.

322
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,279
- YOU DIDN'T TELL ME THAT.
- YEAH--

323
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:00,625
NO, YOU JUST WEREN'T LISTENING.

324
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,523
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- OKAY.

325
00:11:02,592 --> 00:11:03,524
- THAT'S SO SWEET.

326
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:05,803
THINK I PEED MY PANTS.

327
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:07,114
- [laughs]

328
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,151
DANG.
THAT'S A LONG RIDE BACK.

329
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,635
- TELL ME IF THERE'S
AN OUTHOUSE.

330
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,878
- IT'S IN THE WOODS.

331
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:13,811
- YOU PEE IN THE WOODS?
- YEAH, YEAH.

332
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,813
- JOHN WAYNE DIDN'T
HAVE NO OUTHOUSE.

333
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:17,573
- [bleep] ME.

334
00:11:17,642 --> 00:11:19,713
I DON'T WANT TO BE PEEING AND A
[bleep] SPIDER JUST JUMPS ON ME.

335
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:22,095
I MEAN, WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

336
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:25,063
IT'S JUST SCARY BECAUSE
THERE'S CREATURES EVERYWHERE.

337
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:27,031
JENNI, I'M SCARED. JENNI.

338
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,171
- THERE'S NO SPIDERS.
I CHECKED IT OUT.

339
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,172
- [squealing]
JENNI. JENNI.

340
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:31,794
WHERE DO I GO?

341
00:11:31,863 --> 00:11:33,106
I DON'T WANT TO PEE ON MYSELF.

342
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:34,107
I'M SCARED.

343
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:36,212
THERE'S SO MANY BUGS.

344
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,489
AS I'M PEEING, I LOOK DOWN

345
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:39,250
AND THERE'S HUGE WORMS
UNDERNEATH ME.

346
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:42,011
FAT WORMS LIKE THIS,
MOVING UNDER MY VAGINA.

347
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,081
- ALL RIGHT, WELL...

348
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,462
- THAT ONE'S FOR THE BOOKS.

349
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:46,913
WHAT IF I HAD TO POOP?
- [laughs]

350
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:56,888
- BABE, YOU WANT TO FISH?
- NO. FINISH WHAT?

351
00:11:56,957 --> 00:11:58,648
- FISH.
- OH, FISH, YEAH.

352
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,926
OH, JIONNI'S UP IN THAT
SON OF A BITCH.

353
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,513
HE WENT WITHOUT ME.
- YEAH.

354
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:03,343
- SO WE'RE AT THE LAKE,
AND THE LAKE HAS FISH IN IT.

355
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:04,724
SO WE GOTTA GO FISHING.
WHY NOT?

356
00:12:04,793 --> 00:12:06,864
WHAT DO YOU GET FOR BAIT?
- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

357
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,244
- NOTHING YET.

358
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:10,660
I'M SURE THIS IS GONNA BE
AN ONGOING CHALLENGE

359
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,041
BETWEEN MY LITTLE BUDDY AND I.
- THE BASS MASTERS.

360
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,629
- SEE WHO CAN CATCH
THE MOST FISH.

361
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:15,355
- ALL RIGHT, HOLD IT DOWN.

362
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:19,428
BRING IT BACK, AND LET IT GO.

363
00:12:19,497 --> 00:12:23,363
KEEP THE BUTTON DOWN.
OKAY, KEEP IT DOWN.

364
00:12:23,432 --> 00:12:24,916
NOW, LET GO
WHEN YOU GET TO THE TOP.

365
00:12:24,985 --> 00:12:25,917
HEADS UP!

366
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:28,575
[laughs]
OH, GOD.

367
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:29,576
- YOU CROSSED LINES.
- OKAY, GIMME THIS.

368
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:30,991
- HOLD MY POLE. HOLD IT.

369
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,199
- IT'S ON HER, IT'S ON HER.
- HOLD MY POLE.

370
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:33,028
- JIONNI, IT'S ON THE LADY.
[laughing]

371
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:34,926
- HOLD MY POLE.

372
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:36,548
- MY BAD.

373
00:12:36,617 --> 00:12:37,964
IT'S HER FIRST TIME.
- I'M SO SORRY.

374
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:40,069
- IT'S HER FIRST TIME.
- [laughs] OH, MY GOD.

375
00:12:40,138 --> 00:12:41,346
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

376
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:43,728
- I'M SO SORRY
IT GOT IN YOUR HAIR.

377
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,419
I'M NEW.

378
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:46,800
I DON'T WANNA FISH ANYMORE

379
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:48,526
BECAUSE I ALMOST TOOK
SOMEBODY'S EYE OUT, SO...

380
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,770
- NICOLE, I NEED LIVE BAIT.

381
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,530
- OKAY, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO FIND?

382
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:55,395
- I WANT YOU TO GO
BACK IN THE WOODS,

383
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:57,052
THIS IS YOUR MISSION.
YOU HEAR ME?

384
00:12:57,121 --> 00:12:59,295
THIS IS YOUR MISSION.
CAN YOU DO THIS?

385
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:00,641
- WHAT DO I GET?

386
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,712
- I'LL GIVE YOU
SO MUCH KISSING TONIGHT.

387
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,680
THIS IS YOUR MISSION.
CAN YOU ACCOMPLISH THIS?

388
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:06,268
- YES, SIR.
- THIS IS NICOLE'S MISSION.

389
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:07,925
- YES, SIR.
- DON'T LET ME DOWN.

390
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:08,926
- YES, SIR.

391
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:10,859
- BABY, WE NEED WORMS.

392
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:13,068
- [groans]
I DON'T LIKE WORMS.

393
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:14,103
- COME ON, MAN.

394
00:13:14,172 --> 00:13:16,312
GIMME A WHOLE BIG ONE.

395
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:18,073
- AH! STOP [bleep] WIGGLING.
STOP WIGGLING.

396
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:21,283
THIS IS THE GREATER GOOD.
THE GREATER GOOD. NO. NO. NO.

397
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:23,803
NO. NO.

398
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,666
[shuddering]

399
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:27,427
I DON'T LIKE
SLITHERING THINGS.

400
00:13:27,496 --> 00:13:30,085
I DON'T LIKE WHERE I CAN'T TELL
THE HEAD APART FROM THE BOTTOM.

401
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:32,225
GROSS! IT'S JUST GROSS.

402
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:34,606
JUST GET IT ON.
JUST GET IT ON.

403
00:13:34,675 --> 00:13:37,713
JUST GET IT ON.
- WAIT. I'VE GOT A BITE.

404
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:41,924
- [whispering]

405
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:44,202
IT'S THE TINIEST WORM EVER,
JENNI.

406
00:13:44,271 --> 00:13:45,652
- I JUST CAUGHT ONE.

407
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:46,826
- YEAH, ME TOO.

408
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,042
- OH, SNAP.

409
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:59,873
I GOT CHEESE.

410
00:13:59,942 --> 00:14:01,047
IT'S THE ONLY THING I FOUND.

411
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:02,600
- I'M NOT GETTING
[bleep] MICE.

412
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:04,119
CHEESE. WHAT AM I GONNA
DO WITH CHEESE?

413
00:14:04,188 --> 00:14:05,534
- I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

414
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:06,707
- YOU GOT ME CHEESE.

415
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:08,123
- AND I GOT YOU CHEESE

416
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:09,538
AND I ALMOST GOT CAUGHT
AND, LIKE, MURDERED.

417
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,057
I STOLE SOMEBODY'S CHEESE.

418
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,922
IF WE WERE EVER STRANDED
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE,

419
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:15,302
WE WOULD SURVIVE.

420
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:18,927
- HERE WE GO, BABY.
HERE WE GO.

421
00:14:18,996 --> 00:14:21,999
- HEY, WE GOT ANOTHER ONE, BABY.

422
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:24,864
WE GOT ANOTHER ONE.
[laughs]

423
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,107
MAN, THAT SIDE OF THE WOODS
JUST SUCKS.

424
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:30,214
HEY, JENNI, YOU BETTER
HOPE YOU DON'T GET HUNGRY.

425
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:32,664
WHOA! BASS, BABY!

426
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:33,976
LARGEMOUTH!

427
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:36,876
- HOW'S THIS FEEL,
MOTHER[bleep]?

428
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,705
- AT THE END OF THE DAY,
YOU'RE STILL SHORT.

429
00:14:38,774 --> 00:14:40,431
- WHO CARES?
- WHO CARES?

430
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,191
AT LEAST I GET SOME.

431
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,917
- I'M GONNA KICK YOU
RIGHT IN THE FACE, JIONNI.

432
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:45,367
- THIS FISHING CONTEST
IS HEATING UP RIGHT NOW.

433
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:46,678
- IT'S GETTING BAD.

434
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:48,508
JENNI, THIS IS WHAT
A FISH LOOKS LIKE!

435
00:14:48,577 --> 00:14:50,061
- WE'RE EATING TONIGHT,
DON'T WORRY.

436
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,787
- MOTHER[bleep]!

437
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:53,271
- GOT ANOTHER ONE.

438
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,376
- [bleep].
- WHAT?

439
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:55,377
- HE GOT ONE.

440
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:56,481
- HE'S GOT TWO!

441
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,931
- JIONNI HAS THREE!

442
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,208
- THE GIRLS ARE
ABOUT TO GO AT IT.

443
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:00,830
- YEAH, THEY'RE, LIKE,
SMACK-TALKING.

444
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,178
- WE GOT A SNAKE,
A TURTLE, AND A FISH.

445
00:15:03,247 --> 00:15:05,111
- THEY'RE GOING AT IT
RIGHT NOW.

446
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,871
OH, MAN, THEY WERE
CRACKING ME UP.

447
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,356
- OH! I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE
BIGGER THAN YOURS, BUDDY!

448
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:11,048
GUESS WHO'S
EATING GOOD TONIGHT!

449
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:12,566
- NO.

450
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:14,223
- NO.
- YEAH.

451
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:15,604
- NO.

452
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:16,846
- [laughs]

453
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:17,847
- NO.
- OKAY.

454
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,918
- [laughs]

455
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,993
- THERE'S MORE
SNOOKI AND JWOWWON THE WAY.

456
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:26,995
- AND IT CONTINUES NOW.

457
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:29,963
- OH, HOW ROMANTIC.

458
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:32,103
- STARVING?
- THIS IS ROMANTIC.

459
00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:35,589
- I'M GONNA MAKE LOVE TO YOU
BY THE CAMPFIRE, BABE, TONIGHT.

460
00:15:35,658 --> 00:15:36,901
- AWW.

461
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,178
- SO TONIGHT
WE ARE GOING TO DINNER.

462
00:15:38,247 --> 00:15:40,870
AND I FEEL LIKE WE CAME HERE
TO BE ROMANTIC,

463
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,665
SO WHY NOT, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST--
- ONE NIGHT.

464
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,254
- DO ONE NIGHT OF ROMANCE.
- NO PRANKS.

465
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:47,394
- BE CUTE. YEAH, NO PRANKS.

466
00:15:47,463 --> 00:15:49,017
JUST BE IN LOVE.
- JUST ROMANCE.

467
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,088
- I HAD AN AWESOME,
AWESOME TIME TODAY.

468
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:52,710
- MM-HMM.
- ME TOO.

469
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:55,402
- NICOLE, DID YOU END UP
LIKING YOUR HORSE RIDE?

470
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:56,852
- YEAH.

471
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,612
AT FIRST I WAS LIKE,
"[bleep] THIS [bleep]."

472
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,028
- YEAH, YOU WERE MOST NERVOUS
GOING INTO IT.

473
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:02,306
- I KNOW, AND THEN I BECAME
THE MOST NERVOUS.

474
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,341
- THEN WHEN I WAS ON IT
I WAS LIKE,

475
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,756
"OH, MY GOD, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL."

476
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:05,792
- I WAS IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR FISHING SKILLS, MAN.

477
00:16:05,861 --> 00:16:06,689
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU.
- MINE?

478
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,036
- YEAH, I WAS LIKE, "DAMN,

479
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:08,968
THE KID OVER THERE
IS [bleep] NAILING 'EM.

480
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,348
AND YOU HAD A FAKE-ASS WORM.

481
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:13,213
- NICOLE WAS CRACKING ME UP.
- WHY?

482
00:16:13,282 --> 00:16:14,525
- SHE HIT SOME GIRL
IN THE HEAD CASTING IT.

483
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:16,113
- NO WAY.
- YEAH.

484
00:16:16,182 --> 00:16:17,114
- I WAS, LIKE,
FIVE FEET AWAY FROM HER.

485
00:16:17,183 --> 00:16:18,770
- I FELT SO BAD.

486
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,496
- SHE DUCKED, SHE SAT DOWN,
AND I HAD TO TAKE THE POLE.

487
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:21,808
- [laughs]
- AND GO GET IT.

488
00:16:21,877 --> 00:16:23,534
- EMBARRASSING.

489
00:16:23,603 --> 00:16:25,881
- DUDE, WE MUST'VE FISHED
FOR, LIKE, THREE HOURS.

490
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,572
- FOCUS RIGHT NOW IS ON DINNER,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

491
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:30,782
IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD, I GOT
PRANK WAR NUMBER SIX GOING ON.

492
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:33,889
BECAUSE WE ARE GONNA GET THEM
AT THE END OF DINNER.

493
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,856
WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA
PRANK THEM ONE MORE TIME.

494
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:37,410
- IT'S TIME. IT'S SHOW TIME.
- PRANK OF ALL PRANKS.

495
00:16:37,479 --> 00:16:39,619
WANT TO GO SIT
OVER BY THE CAMPFIRE

496
00:16:39,688 --> 00:16:41,034
FOR A LITTLE BIT,
MAYBE HAVE SOME S'MORES?

497
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:42,139
- LET'S DO THIS.
- YAY.

498
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,899
- LET'S DO IT.
- WHOO!

499
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:46,729
- THIS IS AN ART. TO NOT BURN
IT. YEAH, YOU'RE GONNA BURN IT.

500
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:50,492
- ROGER SAID DON'T BURN IT.

501
00:16:50,561 --> 00:16:51,320
SHE SHOVED IT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE--

502
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:52,494
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

503
00:16:52,563 --> 00:16:54,047
[Roger and Jionni laugh]

504
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:55,117
- DOES THAT LOOK BURNT?
- YES.

505
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:56,394
- NO. LOOKIT.

506
00:16:56,463 --> 00:16:58,017
- I GOTTA PEE, MAN.
YOU GOTTA PEE?

507
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:01,468
- YEAH.
- MY FACE IS BURNING.

508
00:17:01,537 --> 00:17:04,057
GO AND LOOK FOR ALIENS.

509
00:17:04,126 --> 00:17:05,645
- I'LL PROBE YOU.

510
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:07,888
- [screams, giggles]
STOP.

511
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:10,063
GO AWAY.

512
00:17:10,132 --> 00:17:12,203
- I'M A LITTLE DRUNK.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

513
00:17:12,272 --> 00:17:13,515
WHOA.

514
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:15,379
MY ASS AND BACK HURTS
ON THIS THING.

515
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,143
- ARE YOU AND ROGER
GONNA DO IT?

516
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:24,112
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.
YOU'RE IN THE BED NEXT TO ME.

517
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:26,666
I DON'T GET OFF KNOWING
THAT THERE'S PEOPLE WATCHING,

518
00:17:26,735 --> 00:17:27,770
AND YOU WATCH.

519
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,600
- NO, YOU SICKO.

520
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:30,911
- SO DO YOU WANT ME TO HAVE SEX
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU?

521
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,327
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

522
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:34,432
- NO, I'M JUST ASKING.
- WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

523
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:35,847
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

524
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,160
- WOULD YOU WATCH,
TURN AROUND, OR LEAVE?

525
00:17:38,229 --> 00:17:40,818
- PROBABLY JUST GO TO SLEEP.

526
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:43,338
- THERE'S NO WAY.
PEOPLE NEXT DOOR COULDN'T EVEN--

527
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:45,029
Roger and Jionni: ARGH!
[girls scream]

528
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:48,239
- [screaming]

529
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:51,139
STOP IT!

530
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:54,314
[laughter]

531
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:58,387
- I HATE YOU.

532
00:17:58,456 --> 00:18:00,458
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

533
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:02,564
I MEAN, THERE HAD TO BE
ONE PRANK.

534
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:04,945
THIS DINNER CAN'T JUST
GO ROMANTICALLY.

535
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:06,464
- I LOVE THAT WE GOT
EACH OTHER'S BACK.

536
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,777
I GO AFTER YOUR GIRL TO KILL,
AND YOU GO AFTER MY GIRL.

537
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,089
- WHY DID YOU GO THAT WAY?

538
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,883
[laughter]

539
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,851
- SO MEAN!
[laughter]

540
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,370
- THE GIRLS WERE TERRIFIED.
I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY.

541
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:17,648
- THEY WERE BOTH PRETTY GOOD.
THAT WAS--THAT WAS GOOD.

542
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:19,512
ROGER AND I NAILED THIS. WE--

543
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:21,617
IT WAS THE BEST PRANK SO FAR.

544
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,723
- BED TIME.

545
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:26,967
- ALL RIGHT,
IT'S OUR TURN TONIGHT, BABE.

546
00:18:27,036 --> 00:18:28,210

00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:32,904
- YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE.

550
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:35,044
- [groans]
- OH, GOD, NO, NO, NO, NO.

551
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,531
I REALLY--I'M TOO FULL.

552
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,671
STOP. STOP. DON'T EVEN--
I'LL THROW UP ON YOU.

553
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,362
BABE.

554
00:18:42,431 --> 00:18:44,123
BABE, NO, I'M PANICKING.

555
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,710
- WAAH!

556
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:46,987

00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,032
- AH! AH... AH...
- [laughs]

560
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:58,206
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
- OH, MAN.

561
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:00,380
- WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

562
00:19:00,449 --> 00:19:02,002
- BECAUSE I CAN'T BREATHE.

563
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:03,556
- YOU STUCK YOUR KNEE UP
WHILE I WAS SHOVING HIS--

564
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,696
- BECAUSE IT WAS A REACTION.

565
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:07,387
I'M SORRY MY KNEES
HURT YOUR BALLS,

566
00:19:07,456 --> 00:19:11,080
BUT YOU HURT MY STOMACH.

567
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,427
- IT'S BLUE BALLS
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

568
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:13,635
- YEAH.

569
00:19:13,704 --> 00:19:16,465
- 400 POUNDS.
I'M SO SORRY, BABE.

570
00:19:16,534 --> 00:19:18,847
YOU LOOK CUTE.

571
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:19,848
EASY ACCESS.

572
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:22,126
- YOU WOULD THINK THAT.

573
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,024
- I'LL PROBABLY HEAR IT
IN 15 MINUTES.

574
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:26,234
- M'KAY.
- TEN.

575
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:29,892
- I'M JUST GOING TO BED
LIKE THIS, 'CAUSE YOU'RE WARM.

576
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,204
- [screams]

577
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:33,344
[laughter]
WHO DID THAT?

578
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:34,828

580
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:37,176

DON'T BLAME ME.

581
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:39,247
SECOND, DON'T SCREAM.

582
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,870
[imitates scream]

583
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,424
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOUR MOUTH
OPEN THAT WIDE.

584
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:46,599
[laughter]

585
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:47,772
- PAYBACK'S A BITCH,
YOU KNOW.

586
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:48,808
JUST SAYIN'.

587
00:19:48,877 --> 00:19:49,809
I'LL REMEMBER THIS.

588
00:19:49,878 --> 00:19:51,569
- [sinister laugh]

589
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:53,226
[rooster crows]

590
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:55,090
SEE YOU LATER, DUDE RANCH.

591
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:56,298
- IT'S BEEN REAL.

592
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:58,438
- I HAD A GREAT TIME
WITH YOU ALL.

593
00:19:58,507 --> 00:20:00,751
- SOME KIDS'LL HAVE FUN
WITH THAT.

594
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,339
- FROM BEGINNING TO END,
THE DUDE RANCH WAS SO MUCH FUN.

595
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:04,375
- I DID ENJOY
THE HORSEBACK RIDING,

596
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:06,101
EVEN THOUGH I WAS TERRIFIED.

597
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,379
THE FACT THAT I DID IT
AND I OVERCAME IT--

598
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:10,243
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.
- ME TOO.

599
00:20:10,312 --> 00:20:12,935
- I FEEL LIKE MORE OF A MAN NOW,
OFF THE DUDE RANCH.

600
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,352
- WE SURVIVED.
- WE SURE DID.

601
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:18,907
- [yawns]
- ADIOS, AMIGOS.

602
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:23,256
- HELLO.

603
00:20:23,325 --> 00:20:24,947
I REALLY WANT TO GET
A DNA TEST.

604
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:26,673
IF I'M AN ALIEN, THAT WOULD BE
THE BEST CASE SCENARIO,

605
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:28,157
BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE AN ALIEN.

606
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,538
I'M NOT FROM CHILE.

607
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:30,470
- NO, YOU MIGHT'VE BEEN
BORN THERE, BUT--

608
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:31,885
- I'M NOT EVEN CHILEAN.

609
00:20:31,954 --> 00:20:33,301
- I NEED A GAY JOEY NIGHT.

610
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,750
- IT'S LIKE A TWERK PARTY
RIGHT NOW.

611
00:20:34,819 --> 00:20:35,924
- WE'RE CATWALKIN'.

612
00:20:35,993 --> 00:20:37,236
- AHH!

613
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:38,340
- OH, MY GOD,
YOU LOOK LIKE JWOWW.

614
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:40,066
- OH, MY GOD.
