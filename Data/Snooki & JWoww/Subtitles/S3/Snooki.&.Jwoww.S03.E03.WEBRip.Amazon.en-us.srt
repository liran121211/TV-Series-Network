00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:06,340
- BABY, YOU ALL RIGHT

2
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,242
OF COURSE I'M GONNA DO

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,211
AND I'M GONNA JUMP OUT
AND SCARE THE CRAP OUT OF HER

00:00:10,278 --> 00:00:12,813

[Icona Pop's I Love It]

12
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:34,868

13
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,304
* I LOVE IT *

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,639

* I DON'T CARE *

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,587
- OW!

21
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,823
EXCUSE ME.

22
00:00:56,824 --> 00:01:00,661
[gasps]
OH, MY GOD!

23
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:03,931
LORENZO, THAT HURT.

24
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,199
CAN WE CUDDLE?

25
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:09,002
[baby babbling and crying]

26
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:11,139
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME?

27
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:13,541
EVERY TIME I HOLD LORENZO
HE STARTS CRYING.

28
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,042
THAT'S SO RUDE.

29
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:17,611
LIKE, I GAVE BIRTH TO YOU.
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME?

30
00:01:17,678 --> 00:01:19,180
[phone ringing]

31
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:20,781
- HELLO?
- HI, JANIS.

32
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:22,250
- HOW'S IT GOING?

33
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,485
- GOOD, WE'RE JUST
GETTING USED TO BEING ALONE.

34
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:25,619
- HOW'S YOUR LITTLE BABY?

35
00:01:25,686 --> 00:01:27,221
- HE'S GOOD.
HE LOVES IT HERE.

36
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:28,489
I FEEL LIKE HE'S HAPPY.

37
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,758
BUT HE STILL LIKES
JIONNI MORE.

38
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,326
- NO, HE DOESN'T.
- YEAH, HE DOES.

39
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:34,562
EVERY TIME I GO AND TRY
AND, LIKE, HOLD HIM,

40
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,430
HE STARTS CRYING
AND HE WANTS JIONNI.

41
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:39,900
- THAT'S BECAUSE JIONNI DOES ALL
THAT ROUGHNECK STUFF WITH HIM.

42
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,702
YOU JUST HAVE TO DO
THE SAME KIND OF THING.

43
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,172
LIKE THAT MOMMY DATE THING
THAT THEY DO.

44
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,174
- WELL, I KNOW THERE'S
"MOMMY AND ME" SWIM CLASSES

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,276
THAT I HEARD ABOUT.
- YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

46
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:49,510
- I JUST WANT HIM TO LIKE ME.

47
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,512
- HE LOVES YOU.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

48
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,414
- MM, NO, HE DOESN'T.
- HE LOVES YOU, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

49
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:54,782
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS SOON NOW.

50
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,083
- OKAY, WE MISS YOU.

51
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:59,253
- TALK TO YOU LATER.
- LOVE YOU, BYE.

52
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,989

[singing]
WE'RE GONNA GO SEE JENNY.

55
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,665
WE'RE HERE, LORENZO.

56
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,835
HI! AND THEY'RE NOT BARKING.
- WHERE'S THE DOGS?

57
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:16,404
THAT'S WEIRD.
- TOLD YOU.

58
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,372
- IT WORKS?
- NO, I DON'T WANT TO JINX IT.

59
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,107
OKAY, DO YOU WANT TO GO
OUT THERE?

60
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,075
- YEAH.

61
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,313
NOELL!
YOU SEE NOELL?

62
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,014
- UGH!
- THIS IS BEAUTIFUL BACK HERE.

63
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,283
SO WE'RE GOING
TO SWIM LESSONS TODAY.

64
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,652
- YOU GONNA GET ALL THE GIRLS?
- NO.

65
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,653
- [laughs]

66
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,654
- NO GIRLS.

67
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:34,722
- PBBT.
- YEAH.

68
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,123
- I DON'T THINK SO.

69
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:37,725
YOU'RE MY BABY.
YOU'RE GONNA STAY THAT WAY.

70
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:38,992
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA HAVE SEX,

71
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,494
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TOUCH
ANYBODY'S BOOBS,

72
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,797
AND YOU'RE GONNA STAY HOME
IN MOMMY'S BASEMENT FOREVER.

73
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,333
JUST LIKE JIONNI.

74
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,801
HIGH FIVE.
GO AHEAD.

75
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:50,704
YEAH!

76
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,641
- HI, ARE YOU HERE FOR SWIMMING?
- YES,

77
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,909
THE "MOMMY AND ME" SWIM CLASS.
- OH, GOOD, YEAH.

78
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,279
- I REALLY HOPE THAT LORENZO
ENJOYS THIS CLASS.

79
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,681
I FEEL LIKE IT'LL STRENGTHEN
OUR BOND A LITTLE BIT.

80
00:03:00,748 --> 00:03:04,885
I ALREADY LOVE HIM TO DEATH.
I JUST WANT HIM TO LOVE ME BACK.

81
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,687
- SO WE'LL DO EACH ONE'S NAME,
AND THEN,

82
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:08,556
WHEN IT'S YOUR CHILD'S NAME,
YOU'LL LIFT THEM UP.

83
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:11,158
WHERE IS LORENZO?
- LORENZO--

84
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,793
OH, WHOOPS.
- WHERE IS LORENZO? [laughs]

85
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,263
- IS HE SMILING?
- THEY'RE SWIMMING IN THE WATER.

86
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:17,030
UP AND DOWN.
A LITTLE BIT.

87
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,300
- SPLASH, SPLASH.
- COOL.

88
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,335
- THAT'S A BABY.
- ISN'T SHE PRETTY?

89
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,637
- ANGELINA.
- HI.

90
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:25,839
- HELLO.
- WHO IS THAT?

91
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,542
[laughter]
- SHE'S GOT BIG EYES.

92
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:31,111
- HE'S SO HANDSOME, ISN'T HE?
- YOU FLIRTING?

93
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,681
- I FEEL LIKE LORENZO'S
A LADIES' MAN, AND I FEEL LIKE

94
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,650
WHEN HE SEES OTHER CUTE BABIES,
ESPECIALLY GIRLS,

95
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,886
YOU KNOW, HE JUST WANTS
TO GET THEIR NUMBER.

96
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,754
- YEAH!
- LORENZO!

97
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,155
- [laughs]

98
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,024
DON'T SPLASH MOMMY.

99
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,093
[baby babbling]
- OH. [laughs]

100
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,628
- ALL RIGHT.

101
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:50,163
I WISH I DIDN'T WEAR EYELASHES
AND MAKEUP TO THIS CLASS,

102
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:52,065
BUT LORENZO'S HAVING
A GOOD TIME.

103
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:55,536
HE'S SMILING, HE'S KICKING.
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED.

104
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:58,672
YOU'RE SUCH A LADIES' MAN.
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

105
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:06,614
IT'S MORNING.

106
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,517
I'M GONNA GO DO INTERVIEWS
TO FIND HIM A BABYSITTER.

107
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:10,851
- OKAY.

108
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,620
- I WANT, LIKE, AN OLD LADY.
- OLD LADY?

109
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,356
- I'M GONNA FIND YOU
A BABYSITTER!

110
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:17,825
NOT HAVING JANIS AROUND
IS DEFINITELY GONNA SUCK,

111
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:20,894
BECAUSE IF WE WANT TO GO OUT ON
A DOUBLE DATE OR GO SOMEWHERE,

112
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,530
WE NEED SOMEBODY
TO WATCH LORENZO.

113
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,064
IT'S A LITTLE SCARY TO US,

114
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,099
BECAUSE WE'RE USED TO HAVING
FAMILY WATCH LORENZO.

115
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,335
- YEAH, WE HAVEN'T
DONE THAT YET.

116
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,337
WE HAVE TO FIND SOMEBODY
PROFESSIONAL.

117
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,604
- PROFESSIONAL, DEFINITELY.

118
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,707
JESUS.

119
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,777
- WOW, YOU LOOK NICE.

120
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,512
- DID HE EAT?
- YUP.

121
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,847
- COME TO MAMA.

122
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:41,014
[baby babbling]

123
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,082
COME.

124
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,884
- OH, MY GOD!
- [screams]

125
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,354
HE TOOK A STEP!
OH, MY GOD. [laughs]

126
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,788
- HE'S GONNA WALK THIS SUMMER.

127
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,990
- I'M GONNA CRY.

128
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,725
I JUST WANT HIM TO BE
MY BABY FOREVER,

129
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,994
BUT I KNOW IT'S INEVITABLE,
HE'S GONNA HOOK UP WITH GIRLS,

130
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,929
HE'S GONNA HAVE GIRLFRIEND--
- SLOBBER KNOBBERS.

131
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,831
- STOP!
- [laughs]

132
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,900
- [scoffs] I JUST DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT LORENZO

133
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,602
HOOKING UP WITH GIRLS!
- HOOK-UPS, KARMA.

134
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,236
- HE'S ONE YEARS OLD,
YOU PERVERT!

135
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:05,373
- [laughs]
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA CRY?

136
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,809
- STOP. STOP IT.
- OH!

137
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:11,211
- LET'S CALL AUNT BOO BOO.

138
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,814
[phone ringing]
- HELLO?

139
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,716
- MORNING, BOO.
- MORNING.

140
00:05:15,783 --> 00:05:19,186
SO REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU
I WANTED TO GO FIND BABYSITTERS?

141
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,822
- YEAH.
- WELL, I FOUND A FEW.

142
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,557
I WAS GONNA GO
INTERVIEW THEM TODAY

143
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:24,858
AT, LIKE, A CAFE,
OR SOMETHING,

144
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,960
AND I WANTED YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

145
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,096
YOU KNOW,
JUST WEED OUT THE CRAZIES.

146
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,431
- AWESOME. YAY.

147
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:31,965
- I WANT TO DO IT
AT A RESTAURANT,

148
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:34,968
AND NOT AT MY HOUSE,
BECAUSE IF I DON'T PICK PEOPLE,

149
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,404
AND THEY GET MAD
AND EGG MY HOUSE,

150
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:37,405
I DON'T NEED THAT [bleep].

151
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,406
- STALKERS.
- YEAH.

152
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:39,640
- GIVE THE BABY A KISS FOR ME.

153
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,809
- OKAY, I LOVE YOU, BYE.
- LOVE YOU.

154
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,744
- IF I CAN'T FIND A BABYSITTER,
THEN THAT MEANS

155
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,245
THAT WE CAN'T DO DOUBLE DATES,
AND--

156
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:47,180
- JANIS IS GONNA HAVE TO
MOVE IN.

157
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:50,250
OH, MY GOD.
TALKED TO NICOLE.

158
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:52,152
WE'RE GONNA GO
LOOK FOR BABYSITTERS,

159
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:55,055
SO THEY CAN ENJOY
THEIR SUMMER IN SEASIDE

160
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:56,757
AND LIKE,
GET OUT WITH US.

161
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:57,991
- LET'S DO SOMETHING FUN
WITH THEM.

162
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,427
- YEAH.
- I FEEL LIKE WE DO DINNER

163
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,694
ALL THE TIME,
LET'S DO SOMETHING--

164
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,430
- I KNOW.
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY IDEAS.

165
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,498
I WANT, LIKE, CRAZY.

166
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,133
- IT'S JUST IMPORTANT
TO SWITCH IT UP,

167
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,435
KEEP THINGS INTERESTING.

168
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:08,902
- WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING
ADVENTUROUS.

169
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,004
LIKE, I TOOK NICOLE--WHEN
WE WERE LIVING IN JERSEY CITY,

170
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,006
I TOOK HER TO THIS PLACE
CALLED "NINJA"...

171
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:15,175
- MM-HMM.
- AND NINJAS JUMPED OUT

172
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,610
AND SCARED
THE BEJESUS OUT OF HER.

173
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,245
- YEAH, I FEEL LIKE
SHE SCARES REALLY EASY.

174
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,447
- YEAH, BUT IT'S FUN.

175
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,114
- THERE'S THIS PLACE
IN PHILLY,

176
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:25,052
IT'S--IT'S LIKE AN ASYLUM.
IT'S LIKE A CLOSED-DOWN PRISON

177
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,920
FROM--I THINK IT'S,
LIKE, THE 1800s.

178
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,922
AND IT'S HAUNTED.
I USED TO TAKE GIRLS THERE

179
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,591
BACK IN THE DAY
AND GET 'EM ALL SCARED,

180
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:31,992
AND THEN I'D BRING 'EM HOME,

181
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,927
AND THEY'D JUST WANT
TO SNUGGLE UP NEXT TO ME.

182
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,729
- SERIOUSLY?

183
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,330
SERIOUS--YOU'RE SERIOUS,
AREN'T YOU?

184
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:39,066

185
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,669
SO YOU'RE TAKING ME
WHERE YOU BROUGHT ANOTHER BITCH?

186
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,203
- YOU PICK IT.
HOW 'BOUT THAT?

187
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,873
- NO, I DON'T MIND.
- OH, OKAY.

188
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:48,476
- I'M HOTTER ANYWAYS.
- MM, THAT'S TRUE, ACTUALLY.

189
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:49,810
- OH, I KNOW IT IS.

190
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,115
- HEY, BOO.

191
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,917
YOU LOOK PRETTY.
- SO DO YOU.

192
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,953
- IF I HAVE TO GET A BABYSITTER,
AND I'M GONNA INTERVIEW PEOPLE,

193
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,824
I JUST WANT TO KNOW FIRSTHAND,
DO YOU HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD?

194
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,059
DO YOU DO DRUGS?
ARE YOU A CHILD MOLESTER?

195
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:08,762
I WANT TO KNOW IT ALL, BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW, THIS IS MY BABY,

196
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:10,764
AND NOBODY'S GONNA
[bleep] WITH HIM.

197
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:12,500
I DIDN'T SLEEP ALL NIGHT.
IT'S LIKE A STRANGER

198
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,167
WATCHING MY KID.
LIKE, IT'S A BIG DEAL.

199
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,969

- OH, THANK YOU.

204
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,978
- SO DO YOU WANT TO, LIKE,
TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF

205
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,514
BEFORE WE START GRILLING YOU?

206
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:30,651
- I'M A SENIOR CITIZEN.
I LOVE CHILDREN.

207
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:33,153
I LOVE BABIES.
THEY'RE SO CUTE.

208
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,722
- HOW ARE YOU YOU?

209
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,424
- STARTED OUT

210
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:39,426

VERY CREEPY,

00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,900
WAS BORN AND RAISED
IN A FUNERAL HOME.

215
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,102
LIKE, DEAD BODIES?
- YES, DEAD ONES.

216
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,604
- SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO
LIVE THEIR LIVES LIKE THAT.

217
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,139
LIKE, THAT'S THEIR JOB.
IF IT WASN'T FOR THEM--

218
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,807
- AND THAT'S CREEPY.

219
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,208
I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS

221
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,277

00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:01,281
HOW DO YOUR BOOBS LOOK?

00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:03,450

00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:07,187
- WOULD YOU CHANGE YOUR DIAPER
BEFORE OR AFTER LORENZO'S?

226
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:10,457
- OH, HE WOULD COME FIRST.
- OKAY.

227
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:12,259
- DO YOU HAVE SEX?
- YES!

228
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,661
- WITH WHO?
- STOP.

229
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:15,929
- A MAN.

230
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,197

FOR HER?

231
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,899
- NOT ANYMORE.

232
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,835
- YOU LOOK STONED.

233
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,271
- YOU KNOW THIS IS AN INTERVIEW
TO BE A BABYSITTER TO MY SON?

234
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,673
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I KNOW.

235
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,576
COULD I GET A BEER?
- IT'S NOT EVEN 12:00.

236
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,078
- THAT'S SO SOMETHING YOU WOULD
DO BEFORE YOU HAD LORENZO.

237
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,213
- EXACTLY, BUT I WOULD NEVER GO
TO A BABYSITTING INTERVIEW.

238
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,182
- AND YOU WOULD NEVER GET HIRED.
- NO.

239
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,950
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
- [laughs]

240
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,686
- WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF
A COUGAR?

241
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,821

YOU LIKE MY LEOPARD HERE?

242
00:08:40,888 --> 00:08:41,922
- YEAH.
- I LIKE THE LEOPARD.

243
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:43,624
- SO IF JIONNI WAS HOME,

244
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,893
WOULD YOU, LIKE,
TRY AND GET WITH HIM?

245
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,796
- JIONNI? NO, ME?
- JUST WONDERING.

246
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,330
YOU KNOW, THAT JUST
MAKES ME FEEL BETTER.

247
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,099
LIKE, THAT'S MY MAN,

00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,452
YOU WOULD'VE MADE OUT
WITH A TRAY.

261
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,622
- I KNOW, I WAS SICK.
- YOU WERE.

262
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,189

263
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:17,991

BY THE WOMEN'S BATHROOM.

265
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,262
IT WAS THE BAR
WE ALWAYS WENT TO!

266
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,997
- BECAUSE I REMEMBER
EVERY TIME I WENT TO KARMA.

267
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,332
ARE YOU KIDDING?
I WAS A [bleep].

00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:28,521
- I HAVE A SPOT

335
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,357
A LITTLE FAR AWAY, BUT...
- OKAY.

336
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,992
- JUST WEAR COMFY CLOTHES.

337
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,762
- I HATE SURPRISES.
- YOU SHOULD LOVE SURPRISES.

338
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,263
- NO, I LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

339
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,931
- WHY?
- I DON'T LIKE IT.

340
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:39,132
[burps]

341
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,240

343
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:51,611
- NO HORSEPLAY.

- YOU CAN PULL HER HAIR.

345
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,048

346
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,083
A LITTLE BIT OF HAIR.

349
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,287
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

350
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:02,089
- I ONLY HAD TWO PAIRS OF BOOTS
WITH ME, SO...

351
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,792
- OH, MY GOD, YOU GUYS BOTH
BUY EXACT SAME JEANS.

352
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,426
SHE HAD THOSE JEANS ON
YESTERDAY.

353
00:12:06,493 --> 00:12:08,495
- JENNY'S NOT WEARING HEELS AND
WE'RE GOING ON A DOUBLE DATE.

354
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,663
WE HAVE TO BE DOING
SOMETHING WEIRD.

355
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,199
LIKE, IT'S NOT JUST A DATE.
- SOMETHING--

356
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:14,234
SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT.
- YEAH.

357
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,403
- JIONNI, GET THE DOOR.
- JIONNI, GET THE DOOR,

358
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,906
I THINK
IT'S THE BABYSITTER.

359
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:21,008
- HI.

360
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,110
I'M MADISON, NICE TO MEET YOU.

361
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:25,412
- THANKS FOR COMING

362
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,280
THIS IS LORENZO.

363
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,150
- HI! YOU'RE SO ADORABLE.
- THANKS.

364
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,619
WE LEFT YOU A LIST.

365
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,189
WE'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE,
SO--[scoffs]

366
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,058
WE JUST WROTE
OUR CELL PHONE NUMBERS.

367
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,526
- OKAY.

368
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,228
AND PUFFS, THEY'RE ALL THERE.
- OKAY.

369
00:12:41,294 --> 00:12:44,564
- IT'S DEFINITELY HARD TO LEAVE
LORENZO WITH A STRANGER.

370
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,500
WE'RE NOT USED TO THAT, WE'RE
USED TO FAMILY WATCHING LORENZO,

371
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,636
SO THIS IS, LIKE,
A BIG STEP FOR US.

372
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,038
- I'M DEFINITELY
THINKING ABOUT IT.

373
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,639
- IT'S HARD.
- IT'S IN THE BACK OF MY MIND.

374
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:55,342
- LOVE YOU.
- BYE, DADA.

375
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,743
- SAY "BYE, MOMMY.
BYE, DADDY."

376
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:59,546
- ALL RIGHT, KIDS, I'M READY.

377
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,449

00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,660
- ENZO?

381
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,562
- [gasps]
IT'S LORENZO'S PLACE.

382
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,630
I WONDER HOW HE'S DOING.
- WHY DON'T YOU CALL HER?

383
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:18,932
- GIVE HER A FEW MINUTES.

384
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:19,900
HER BOYFRIEND PROBABLY
JUST GOT THERE.

385
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,869
- UGH, PLEASE.

386
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,303
[phone ringing]
- [gasps]

387
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,405
LORENZO,
I THINK MOM'S CALLING.

388
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,975
- HI.

389
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,409

00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,780
DO YOU WANT TO SAY HI?

00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:35,382

HE'S SMILING.

396
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,724
- ALL RIGHT, COOL.

397
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,927

SAY "BYE, MOMMY."

398
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:49,629
- BYE, LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU.

399
00:13:57,804 --> 00:14:00,373
- ARE YOU KIDS EXCITED?
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

400
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,042
- NERVOUS?

401
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,610
- I DON'T LIKE SURPRISES.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

402
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,113
- ARE YOU CLAUSTROPHOBIC?
- VERY.

403
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:08,415
- YOU MAY NOT LIVE
TO MAKE IT BACK.

404
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,917
- IS THIS LIFE-THREATENING?

405
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,518
- YES, I'M GONNA BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

406
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,921
IT'S POTENTIALLY--WE'RE GONNA
MAKE IT AS SAFE AS IT CAN BE,

407
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:15,222
BUT IT'S POTENTIALLY
LIFE-THREATENING.

408
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,790
- WHERE THE [bleep]
ARE WE GOING?

409
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:20,260
YOU KILLING US?
- NO.

410
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,062
NOT YET.
- NOT YET?

411
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,997
- NOT YET.

412
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:34,574
- IS THERE A BATHROOM HERE?

413
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,947
- [bleep] IS THIS?
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

414
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,781
- THIS IS NOT
A ROMANTIC DOUBLE DATE.

415
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,016
- ALL RIGHT, KIDS.
- WE'RE HERE.

416
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,486
- UGH,
I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD.

417
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,588
- [spooky humming]
- ARE YOU OKAY?

418
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,257
- THIS IS A [bleep]
HAUNTED HOUSE!

419
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,258
- IS THAT WHY
YOU'RE GONNA THROW UP?

420
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,026
- KIND OF.

421
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,995
OH, I GOTTA POOP.
[laughter]

422
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,529
- WELCOME.

423
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,764
- I FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA [bleep] MY PANTS

424
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,132
AND THROW UP
AT THE SAME TIME.

425
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,968
I MEAN, I DON'T FEEL GOOD
RIGHT NOW,

426
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,436
AND I FEEL LIKE
THAT'S CALLED ANXIETY.

427
00:15:03,503 --> 00:15:05,338
- HEY, GUYS.
- OH!

428
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,974
- [laughing] WHAT'S UP?
- WELCOME TO PENNHURST.

429
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,775
I'LL BE YOUR PARANORMAL
INVESTIGATOR TONIGHT.

430
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,310
- OH, MY [bleep]!

431
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,045
- SHE'S GONNA BE
YOUR PSYCHIC MEDIUM.

432
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:14,281
- I WANT TO BE SCARED, I WANT
TO LEAVE HERE TERRIFIED, AND--

433
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,283
- I WANT A GHOST TO PUNCH ME
IN THE [bleep] FACE.

434
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,985
- I DO TOO. I WOULD--
- I WANT BRUISES ALL OVER.

435
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,187
- OH, YEAH.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT.

436
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,489
- SHUT UP!
- WHAT?

437
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:24,424
- AS YOU CAN SEE BY THE SIGN,
IT OPENED IN 1908.

438
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:25,725
IT USED TO BE
A STATE SCHOOL

439
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:27,260
FOR THE FEEBLE-MINDED
AND EPILEPTIC.

440
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,561
- O-M-G.
- AND THEN--

441
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:29,729
- FEEBLE-MINDED.
WE'RE GONNA FIT RIGHT IN.

442
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,164
- ARE YOU SCARED?
- YES,

443
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:32,699
'CAUSE I KNOW THIS IS REAL.
YOU GUYS DON'T,

444
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,068
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "OH,
IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES." NO.

445
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,104
- OKAY,
YOU GUYS READY FOR THIS?

446
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,671
- NOW I HAVE TO PEE.
- LET THE BIGGER GUYS GO.

447
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,407
- YEAH, GET IN THERE.
- I THOUGHT THIS WAS DIFFERENT.

448
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,808
- BOO!
- [screams]

449
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,010
[bleep]!
[laughter]

450
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,411
[bleep].

451
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,217
- THERE'S MORE
SNOOKI AND JWOWW ON THE WAY,

452
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,452
AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

453
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,388
- REAL QUICK HISTORY
OF THIS BUILDING.

454
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,057
THIS IS THE ADMINISTRATIONS
BUILDING.

455
00:15:57,124 --> 00:15:59,459
LIKE, WHERE YOU GUYS CAME IN,
THAT'S WHERE THEY WOULD DROP OFF

456
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:03,163
ALL THESE POOR KIDS, YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES.

457
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,265
- THIS IS NOT
MY IDEAL DOUBLE DATE,

458
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,467
BUT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS...

459
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,602
- ME TOO.
- BECAUSE I'M JUST INTO, LIKE,

460
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,672
FREAKY PARANORMAL STUFF.
I'M, LIKE, A WEIRDO LIKE THAT.

461
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:16,343
THAT'S WHAT I READ IN MY BOOKS.
I READ PARANORMAL BOOKS.

462
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,710
[chuckles]

463
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:19,046
[chuckles]
- [laughs]

464
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,247
- I READ.

465
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,283
[both laughing]

466
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,385
[metallic crashing]
[screams]

467
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:27,487
- [laughs]
- SORRY.

468
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:28,821
WAS THAT YOU, BABE?
- ROGER.

469
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,090
- BABE!
- I DIDN'T MEAN

470
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:32,659
TO MAKE THE SHOVEL FALL.
[laughter]

471
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,062
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
[laughter]

472
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,229
- CAN YOU BE DONE NOW?
I'M NOT KIDDING,

473
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,697
I'M GONNA HAVE
A HEART ATTACK.

474
00:16:37,764 --> 00:16:40,833
I NEED JESUS, I NEED PRAYERS,
AND I NEED GANDHI.

475
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,635
- ARE YOU AIMING THAT
AT MY [bleep]?

476
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,404
[laughter]
WHAT'S THE READING?

477
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,173
- THEY'RE WARMER
THAN THE REST OF HER BODY.

478
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,674
[laughter]
- TOLD YOU.

479
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,576
- IF WE WERE IN A HORROR MOVIE
RIGHT NOW, I'D BE,

480
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,944
LIKE, THE FIRST ONE TO GO,
'CAUSE I HAVE THE BOOBS.

481
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,980
ACTUALLY, ALL FOUR OF US
WOULD BE DEAD FIRST,

482
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:55,815
'CAUSE WE ALL QUALIFY
FOR THE IDIOT

483
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,117
IN THE BEGINNING
THAT GOES DOWN.

484
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:58,718
- YOU'RE RECORDING?
- YEAH.

485
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,087
- THERE'S WATER HERE, BUT
WE'LL GET THROUGH IT QUICKLY.

486
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:03,356
- I CAN'T EVEN SEE.
[both laughing]

487
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:06,893
- I ALWAYS FEEL A HEAVINESS
ON MY CHEST, AND WE'LL GO...

488
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,728
- SHE DOES TOO.
- OVER INTO ONE OF THESE ROOMS.

489
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,730
- IF THERE'S ANYBODY HERE
WITH US,

490
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,466
CAN YOU MAKE
YOUR PRESENCE KNOWN?

491
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:16,103
- [makes fart noise]
[laughter]

492
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,404
- ROGER.

493
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,005
ROGER'S DEFINITELY
[bleep] AROUND TOO MUCH,

494
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:21,308
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND
A LITTLE JOKE HERE AND THERE,

495
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,276
BUT HE'S, LIKE,
MAKING FUN OF THE WHOLE THING,

496
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:24,744
AND I'M TRYING
TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.

497
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:26,213
LIKE, THAT'S
KIND OF ANNOYING.

498
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,980
- CAN I ASK THE FIRST QUESTION?
- GO AHEAD.

499
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:31,118
- DO YOU WANT NICOLE
TO GET IN THERE WITH YOU?

500
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,988
- [starts]
- [laughs] STOP.

501
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:37,724
- ROGER, STOP.

502
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,160
- I WAS TOUCHED THREE TIMES WHEN
WE WENT JUST ON A QUICK WALK.

503
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,395
- TWO OF THOSE WERE ME.
[laughter]

504
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,863
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS
WITH THIS GUY.

505
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,200
- WHERE'S ROGER?
- YEAH, HE MAKES ME NERVOUS.

506
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:49,269
- ROGER?

507
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,205
- BAH!
- [starts]

508
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,141
- YOU HAD IT UP--AH!
[clanging]

509
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:55,575
[laughter]
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

510
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,144
- OH!
- [laughs]

511
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,345
- LITERALLY JUMPED
OUT OF MY SKIN.

512
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,380
- MY HEART GOES
DOWN TO MY VAGINA,

513
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,615
I WANT TO DIE, I'M LIKE, "WHAT
THE [bleep] JUST HAPPENED?"

514
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,984
I THOUGHT IT WAS THE EVIL GHOST,
LIKE, TRYING TO SCARE US.

515
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,319
- WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE
YOUR VAGINA?

516
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,020
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT IT WAS ROGER.

517
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,289
[screams]

518
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:10,523
- WHAT?

519
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,225
- SOMEONE JUST BLEW
ON MY NECK.

520
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,960
[shuddering scream]

521
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,228
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- OH, MY GOD!

522
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,197
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
- [whimpers]

523
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:21,601
ALL OF A SUDDEN, I FELT, LIKE,
THIS THING, LIKE, GO UP MY BACK.

524
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,271
IT WAS NOT JIONNI.
I KNOW WHAT A HAND FEELS LIKE.

525
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,374
IT WAS NOT A HAND.
IT WAS LIKE AIR.

526
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:32,345
IT WASN'T YOU,
I KNOW IT.

527
00:18:32,412 --> 00:18:35,415
JIONNI, WAS IT YOU?
- NO, IT WASN'T ME.

528
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:38,385
- YO, CHECK THIS OUT.

529
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,086
THERE'S A LITTLE KIDDIE POOL
BACK HERE.

530
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,754
- WHY DON'T WE DO A SESSION
RIGHT NEXT TO IT?

531
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:44,524
- ARE YOU SCARED?

532
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:46,359
- DO YOU WANT YOUR MOMMY?

533
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,595
- I'M A MOM,
YOU CAN TOUCH ME.

534
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,029
- HERE, WHY DON'T WE CHECK
THE AUDIO ON THAT?

535
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,598
- [recorded voice]
DO YOU WANT YOUR MOMMY?

536
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,099
- [garbled voice] MOMMY.
- I'M A MOMMY--

537
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,867
- HOLY--
- WHAT'D IT SAY?

538
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,469
- OF EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD
THUS FAR,

539
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:57,437
THAT IS THE BEST ONE.
- WHAT'D IT SAY? WHAT'D IT SAY?

540
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:58,671
- IT SOUNDED LIKE "MOMMY."

541
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,207
- WE HEARD THE GHOST
SAY "MOMMY,"

542
00:19:00,207 --> 00:19:02,209
AND THAT JUST
MAKES EVERYTHING WORSE.

543
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,244
IT JUST CLARIFIES,
YOU KNOW,

544
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:05,945
THAT THERE ARE GHOSTIES
IN THIS WORLD.

545
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,847
- HONEST QUESTION:
WOULD YOU SPEND THE NIGHT

546
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:09,549
IN THERE BY YOURSELF?
- NO. HELL, NO.

547
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:10,783
- I WOULD.
- BY YOURSELF? NO.

548
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,285
- I NEVER--NEVER
IN A MILLION YEARS.

549
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,753
- IT'S POINTLESS.
- I WOULDN'T.

550
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,888
SO WE NEED TO GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE,

551
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,357
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT
THE EVIL SPIRIT,

552
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:18,758
LIKE,
THROWING [bleep] AT US.

553
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,493
OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

554
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,794
- I'M JUST SCARED.

555
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,630
- [growls]
- [screams]

556
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:27,033
YOU'RE SUCH [bleep].
I SWEAR TO GOD.

557
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,070
- BYE.

558
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,139
[thunder crashing]

559
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,607
- SORRY WE WERE SO LATE.

560
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,443

561
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,844

562
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:38,878

00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,580
- ARE YOU READY FOR BED?
- YES.

564
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:43,850
FIRST NIGHT OF LORENZO
WITH THE BABYSITTER.

565
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,018
- HOW'D YOU FEEL? IT WAS
PRETTY COMFORTABLE, RIGHT?

566
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,355
- I WAS GOOD.
- SHE REALLY WASN'T BAD.

567
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,690
- WHY, 'CAUSE YOU LIKE HER?
- OH, MY GOD.

568
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,325
- GO BE WITH THE BABYSITTER
THEN.

569
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:55,662

GOOD NIGHT.

00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,466
- GET OFF.

571
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,534

00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,675
- TURN OFF THE LIGHT.
- [groans]

573
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:11,611
- THANK YOU FOR GOING WITH ME.
- WELL.

574
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:15,482
- DID YOU GET SCARED AT ALL?
- NO. A LITTLE BIT.

575
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,551
I GOT MORE SCARED
OF THE THUNDER.

576
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,221
- BAH!

577
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,357
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
- [laughs]

578
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:25,825
- HEY, DON'T BE A [bleep].

580
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,398
BEFORE THE GIRLS GET BACK.

00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,466

00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,036

585
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,439
- WE'RE GOING TO A.C.
- OH, MY GOD.

586
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:41,374
- IN THE BACK OF JIONNI'S MIND
HE'S LIKE,

587
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43,075
"I HOPE SHE DOESN'T GET
TOO DRUNK"...

588
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,377
[screaming and laughing]

589
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:45,845
