I'M GONNA JUST JUMP
IN THE CLEAN WATER.

LIKE, "YOU SHOULD SHOW OFF
YOUR STOMACH,"

00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:12,005
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,
BUT, BITCH, LET'S GET REAL.

163
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,441
IF YOU WERE PREGNANT
AND YOUR BODY WAS CHANGING,

164
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,443
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
SHOW THAT [bleep] OFF.

- WHERE'S
THE NORMAL PAVEMENT?

246
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,190
IT FEELS LIKE
[bleep] ITALY.

247
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,026
THIS ZOO IS LIKE
A SAFARI,

- NOW LOOK INSIDE.

- I CANNOT EXPLAIN TO YOU
THE FEAR I HAVE WITH CROCODILES,

255
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:33,807
AND I'M ACTUALLY TRYING TO
CONQUER MY FEAR RIGHT NOW,

256
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,443
BUT I THINK I'M ACTUALLY
[bleep] MYSELF AT THE SAME TIME.

JUST A SECOND HERE.

I FEEL LIKE THIS ZOO
IS JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

266
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,360
THAN AN AMERICAN ZOO.

267
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,463
I MEAN, THERE'S A BARRIER WHEN
IT COMES TO AN AMERICAN ZOO,

268
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,231
AND IT'S JUST
A FREE-FOR-ALL HERE.

AND THEY HAD AN AMAZING TIME
AT THE ZOO, JUST LIKE I DID,

286

AND THERE WASN'T
ANY DRINKING INVOLVED,

I DON'T THINK YOU COULD
GET A TAN FROM TWIRLING FIRE

00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,252
THE ONLY THING I PLANNED
IN MY DAY WAS THE ZOO.

339
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,121
- WE'RE ONLY TAKING SHOTS,
NO DRINKS!

340
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,456
- SHOT?
- SHOT!

341
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:44,364
* *

342
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,034
- I'M BORED.

343
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,701
- WHAT?
- I'M BORED.

344
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,071
- WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
A LAP DANCE?

345
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,840
- NO.

346
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,242
* *

347
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:59,312
I'M TIRED.

348
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,949
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TAKE THIS TRIP

349
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,984
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,
IF I WASN'T PREGNANT,

350
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,518
I'D BE STOKED
TO GO TO CANCUN,

351
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,855
AND I'D BE LIKE, "I'M DRINKING
THE WHOLE [bleep] TIME."

352
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,222
BUT NOW I'M PREGNANT,
SO, YOU KNOW,

353
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,258
THIS IS KIND OF LIKE
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME,

354
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:12,860
AND I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT.

355
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,130
* *

356
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,199
- COME ON, YOU KNOW
YOU WANT TO DANCE.

357
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,434
* *

358
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,370
- WHERE'S THE BATHROOM?

359
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,205
- YOU GOTTA GO THIS WAY.

360
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,539
* *

361
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:28,909
- I'LL GO WITH YOU.
I GOTTA PEE.

362
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,543
- YOU NEED TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM?

363
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,345
- YEAH, BUT I'LL HOLD IT.

364
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,014
- BATHROOM BREAK!

365
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:37,885
* *

366
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:40,187
- I FEEL TERRIBLE
FOR LEAVING NICOLE.

367
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,455
I FEEL [bleep] TERRIBLE.

368
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:43,991
* *

369
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:47,060
- I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE
THIS PLACE IS GETTING CROWDED.

370
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,996
* *

371
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:52,099
EVERYONE IS PSYCHOTIC,
CRAZY DRUNK.

372
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:56,036
* *

373
00:13:56,036 --> 00:14:02,775
[overlapping shouting,
rock music]

374
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,644
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT'S MADNESS.

375
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:06,613
GUYS THAT DON'T EVEN
KNOW EACH OTHER ARE FIGHTING,

376
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,915
AND THEN, LIKE,
I SWEAR TO GOD,

377
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:10,217
AN ELBOW CRACKS ME
IN MY EYE.

378
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:13,153
MY EYE!
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

379
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,754
- I'M LIKE, ABOUT TO CRY
IN TEARS,

380
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,256
BECAUSE I'M, LIKE,
SERIOUSLY,

381
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,657
"I SHOULDN'T BE HERE."

382
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,159
THERE'S A FIGHT BREAKING OUT.

383
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,961
YOU KNOW, GOD FORBID SOMEONE
BUMPED INTO ME,

384
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:23,396
AND, YOU KNOW, I GOT HURT
AND LOST THE BABY.

385
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,665
LIKE, I DON'T NEED TO BE
IN DANGER LIKE THAT.

386
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,939
- THERE'S MORE SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW
ON THE WAY,

387
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:35,108
AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

388
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:36,109
[club music]

389
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,310
- I'M JUST MAD TIRED,

390
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,778
AND THEN THE FIGHT
JUST HAPPENED.

391
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,948
I'M IN A DIFFERENT MINDSET
THAN ALL OF YOU.

392
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:44,217
LIKE, GOD FORBID SOMETHING
HIT ME IN THE STOMACH,

393
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,352
AND I HAD A MISCARRIAGE.

394
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:46,987
LIKE, THIS ISN'T
MY SCENE RIGHT NOW.

395
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:48,956
I'M [bleep] ENGAGED,
AND I'M FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT.

396
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,457
LET'S BE SERIOUS.

397
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,960
I HONESTLY THINK I'M JUST
NOT THINKING STRAIGHT,

398
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,128
AND I'M NOT BEING RESPONSIBLE
ABOUT BEING PREGNANT,

399
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,497
AND I--I'M KIND OF PISSED OFF
AT MYSELF FOR IT.

400
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,466
IT'S [bleep] 2:00
IN THE MORNING.

401
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,633
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE!

402
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,635
- COME ON!
TODAY WAS YOUR DAY!

403
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,606
YOU COULD HAVE SAID NO!
YOU COULD HAVE SAID NO!

404
00:15:06,606 --> 00:15:08,408
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

405
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,078
- SO NICOLE WANTS TO GO,
AND I REALLY WANTED TO STAY,

406
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:12,645
BUT IT IS HER NIGHT,

407
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,614
SO I'LL JUST MAKE SURE
I GO HARDER TOMORROW.

408
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,083
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

409
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,985
- YOU KNOW BEACH PALACE?

410
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:21,989
* *

411
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:27,995
- DOLPHIN DAY! DOLPHIN DAY!
DOLPHIN DAY! DOLPHIN DAY!

412
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,497
- STOP. I HAVE TO PEE.
- LET'S GO.

413
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,832
- I'M ACTUALLY VERY EXCITED
TO SEE THE DOLPHINS

414
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:34,467
BECAUSE I SWAM
WITH DOLPHINS BEFORE,

415
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,503
AND IT'S [bleep] AMAZING,
AND, YOU KNOW,

416
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:37,904
IT PUTS EVERYONE
IN A GOOD MOOD

417
00:15:37,904 --> 00:15:40,040
AND ALSO BECAUSE
WE'RE NOT DRINKING

418
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,341
SO THAT I CAN,
YOU KNOW,

419
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,543
BE A PART OF SOMETHING
WITH THE GIRLS.

420
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,112
- WELCOME TO
DOLPHIN DISCOVERY!

421
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:47,414
ARE YOU READY?
- YEAH!

422
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,050
[laughs] OOH!

423
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,919

424
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,754
[applause]

425
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:56,523
- WHOO!

00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:57,724
- OH!

427
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,592
- EXCELLENT!

428
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,928
- AAH!

[cheering]

430
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,466
- EXCELLENT.
VERY NICE.

431
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,867
- I LOVE THAT.

432
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,803
I'LL NEVER GET HOW THESE
DOLPHINS ARE THIS TRAINABLE.

433
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,273
LIKE, MY DOGS CAN'T EVEN [bleep]
PISS ON A WEE-WEE,

434
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:16,043
AND YET DOLPHINS
CAN DANCE IN THE WATER.

435
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:20,213
- WHOO!
- AAH! HIGHER!

436
00:16:20,213 --> 00:16:22,882
- AAH!
- HIGHER. THAT'S RIGHT.

437
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:24,317
- AAH!

438
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,753
- I GOT BITCH-SMACKED
BY A DOLPHIN!

439
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,188
- I MEAN,
I'M NOT EVEN THINKING

440
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,257
ABOUT LAST NIGHT
BEING A BUZZKILL

441
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,059
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I'M HAVING SUCH A GREAT TIME

442
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:33,893
WITH THE ANIMALS,
AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW,

443
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,163
REALLY THE ONLY THING
THAT I WANT TO DO ON THIS TRIP.

444
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:39,766
[upbeat music]

445
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,834
BYE.

446
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,070
OH, IT WAVED!

447
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,571
BYE!

448
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,975
[whimsical music]

449
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:52,879
- HI, CAN YOU SEND UP
A BOTTLE OF ABSOLUT?

450
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:53,913
THANK YOU.

451
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:54,914
[hangs up phone receiver]

452
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,416
- SINCE WHEN DID YOU
BECOME FUN?

453
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,218
- [laughs]

454
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:01,321
- 'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE YOU
NEVER DRANK WITH ME LIKE THIS.

455
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,955
WHO THE [bleep]
IS THIS GIRL?

456
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,392
BECAUSE BEFORE I WAS PREGNANT,
SHE NEVER WANTED TO GO OUT,

457
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:07,127
SHE NEVER WANTED TO DRINK,

458
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,895
AND NOW THAT I'M PREGNANT,
ALL OF A SUDDEN, SHE'S FUN.

459
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:10,597
I'M LIKE, COOL, LIKE,
WHERE WERE YOU

460
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,265
THE PAST THREE YEARS
THAT I KNEW YOU?

461
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:15,702
- LET ME JUST TRY
THE OTHER SHIRT ON REAL QUICK.

462
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:16,836
- BUT OF COURSE,
WHEN I'M PREGNANT,

463
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:17,904
THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE FUN.

464
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:22,008
- OH, MY GOD!
- YEAH, COOL.

465
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,610
- I KIND OF DO TAKE
OFFENSE TO THE FACT

466
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,112
THAT NICOLE THINKS

467
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:26,813
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER PARTIED AND HAD FUN.

468
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,116
TECHNICALLY, THIS JENNI
HAS ALWAYS BEEN HERE,

469
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,551
BUT NICOLE WAS TOO BLACKOUT
TO NOTICE.

470
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,121
WE'RE LEAVING!

471
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,294
WE'RE IN THE ELEVATOR!

472
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:44,131
- WHATEVER.

473
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,032
- NICOLE!
YOU GO.

474
00:17:49,469 --> 00:17:50,670
- I FEEL LIKE IF
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO,

475
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,971
SHE DOESN'T GIVE A [bleep].

476
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:53,140
- YEAH, BUT SHE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY CONSIDERATION

477
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,242
FOR ANYBODY ELSE
WHO WANTS TO GO.

478
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,810
LIKE, WHY MAKE OUR LIVES
MISERABLE

479
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,579
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE HERE?

480
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,281
- STOP SCREAMING AT ME.

481
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,049
- WELL, YOU'RE LATE.

482
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,152
- THEN GO WITHOUT ME.
I REALLY DON'T CARE.

483
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,953
- WE'RE NOT GONNA GO
WITHOUT YOU.

484
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,322
BE CONSIDERATE.

485
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,057
- I AM.
YOU BE CONSIDERATE.

486
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,226
I'M PREGNANT, AND WE'RE ALL,
"WHOO!"

487
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:15,495
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO.
- THEN DON'T.

488
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:18,165
- NO, 'CAUSE I'M NOT
GONNA SIT IN THE ROOM BY MYSELF.

489
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,170
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT,
YOU GET IN THESE MOODS

490
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,272
WHERE YOU DON'T [bleep]
LIKE ANYONE,

491
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:28,040
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M KIND OF
TAKING IT OUT ON JENNI.

492
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,658
- I JUST WANT TO DANCE
TONIGHT.

493
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,827
I WANNA HEAR
GOOD MUSIC.

494
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,831
- DURING THE WHOLE DINNER,

495
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:54,201
I'M CONTEMPLATING WHETHER
I SHOULD GET UP OR STAY.

496
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,268
I MEAN, AT THIS POINT,

497
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,370
I JUST WANT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE GIRLS,

498
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,673
AND I JUST DEFINITELY
WANT TO LEAVE CANCUN NOW.

499
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,242
- CHEERS.
- CHEERS.

500
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,080
- OH, GOD.
[bleep].

501
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,049
- DON'T MAKE THAT--YEAH,
DON'T GIVE ME THAT FACE.

502
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,284
- SORRY THAT SHE'S PREGNANT

503
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,453
BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO GO
HARD AS I CAN.

504
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,487
I MEAN, IT'S CANCUN.

505
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,523
ARE YOU ANNOYED?
- NO.

506
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:20,760
- TIRED?
- I'M NOT GOING OUT, SO...

507
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,564
- DEALING WITH NICOLE
IN CANCUN SUCKS.

508
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:25,965
LIKE, I WISH
SHE DIDN'T COME.

509
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,068
IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE
FOR HER.

510
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,570
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

511
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,771
- NIGHT.

512
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:37,644
- UM, GO, GO, GO, GO.

513
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,980
HOLA.

514
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,783
- YEAH!
[laughs]

515
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,654
- YOU'RE STILL COLD?

516
00:19:47,654 --> 00:19:52,091
- JUST FOR A COUPLE MINUTES.
ARE YOU STAYING?

517
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:55,695
- YEAH.

518
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,063
- NICOLE IS NOT
GOING OUT TONIGHT,

519
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,665
AND I AM NOT
ASKING HER WHY

520
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,166
BECAUSE IT IS MY NIGHT,

521
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,971
AND I REFUSE TO MAKE NICOLE
STAY WITH ME OUT THE WHOLE TIME.

522
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:07,206
[line ringing]

523
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,376
- I FEEL BAD.

524
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,278
[line ringing]

525
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:13,212
SHE INVITED ME HERE.

526
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,984
[line ringing]

527
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:21,554
- THIS TRIP WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AMAZINGLY FUN WITH MY FRIENDS,

528
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,756
BUT I JUST FEEL ALONE
AND PREGNANT

529
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,293
AND NO ONE THERE
TO SUPPORT ME.

530
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,461
I'M REALLY SAD.

531
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:32,365
[dramatic music]

532
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:35,502
I DON'T THINK I WANT TO LIVE
WITH JENNI ANYMORE.

533
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:39,772
- I DON'T KNOW
IF WE'RE COMING, BABE.

534
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,840
- SO YOU'RE NOT COMING?

535
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,809
ROGER FINALLY HAS GONE
WAY TOO FAR.

536
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,011
TO BE HONEST, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF WE'RE TOGETHER AT THIS POINT.

537
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,246
- THEY'RE ALL OVER HIM.

538
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,915
I'M, LIKE, QUESTIONING
OUR ENGAGEMENT.

539
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,283
LIKE, ARE YOU READY?

540
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:51,418
- I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU WERE READY

541
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,252
TO BE A MOTHER
AND A--AND A--AND A WIFE.

542
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,355
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT.
- THAT WAS MEAN.

543
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,356
[hangs up phone receiver]
