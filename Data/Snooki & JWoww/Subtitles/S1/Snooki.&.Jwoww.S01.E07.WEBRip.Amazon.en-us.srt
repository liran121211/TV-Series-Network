1
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:04,472
- SHE'S KNOCKED UP.

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:05,773
- STOP SAYING IT LIKE THAT.
IT REALLY HURTS MY FEELINGS.

3
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:06,974
- REALLY?

4
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,277
- IT HURTS MY FEELINGS.
I'M VERY SENSITIVE.

5
00:00:09,277 --> 00:00:11,879
- OH, MY GOD.
CALM DOWN, HORMONAL.

6
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,281
- DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR
THAT YOU JUST

7
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:14,948
CONSTANTLY BULL-[bleep] ME.

8
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:17,318
YOU'RE BEING SUED RIGHT NOW.
JUST DON'T LIE.

9
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:18,986
JUST DON'T LIE.
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

10
00:00:18,986 --> 00:00:22,356
- WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW?

11
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,992
- * I DON'T CARE *

12
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,460
* I LOVE IT *

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,529
* I DON'T CARE *

14
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,830
* I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT *

15
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,466
* I DON'T CARE *

16
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:35,536
* I LOVE IT *

17
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,471
* I DON'T CARE *

18
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,746
- ALL THE PROBLEMS
WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST

19
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:49,583
WOULD BE COMPLETELY AVOIDED AND
AVERTED IF YOU WERE JUST HONEST.

20
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,719
- SORRY I LIED, ALL RIGHT?

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,121
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

22
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:54,888
I WAKE UP THIS MORNING,
AND I FIND OUT

23
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:58,326
THERE'S A LAWSUIT GOING
ON IN SOME WAY.

24
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:00,394
YEAH, I DID [bleep] UP, AND
I DIDN'T TELL HIM EVERYTHING,

25
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:02,029
SO I APOLOGIZED TO HIM.

26
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,364
AND I AM SORRY FOR THAT.

27
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,366
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH IN THE PAST.

28
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:08,136
I WOULD THINK THAT,
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, YOU KNOW,

29
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:09,537
WOULD YOU STOP WITH
THE BULL-[bleep] ALREADY,

30
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:10,538
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

31
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:14,675
- I WAS 22 YEARS OLD!

32
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,277
- IT IS WHAT IT IS, YOU KNOW?

33
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:17,745
- MM.

34
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:19,913
- I COULD HAVE CARED LESS
IF SHE WAS BEING SUED.

35
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,981
WHY WOULD THAT MAKE
ANY DIFFERENCE TO ME?

36
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:22,183
I DON'T CARE.

37
00:01:22,183 --> 00:01:24,485
IT'S THE MISREPRESENTATION
OF YOURSELF

38
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:25,653
AND THE LYING,
THAT BOTHERS ME.

39
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:27,621
ALL RIGHT, WELL, CALL ME LATER

40
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,957
AND WE'LL TALK, I GUESS.

41
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,959
- OKAY.

42
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,594
BYE.

43
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,564
I AM [bleep] SO PISSED
OFF RIGHT NOW.

44
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,166
I'M, LIKE, READY
TO THROW UP RIGHT NOW.

45
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,900
- YOU NEED A COCKTAIL.

46
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,973
- I NEED TO GET OUT
OF THIS HOUSE.

47
00:01:45,973 --> 00:01:51,212
- CAN I HAVE
A TOASTED BLUEBERRY MUFFIN?

48
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:53,347
I HOPE HE COMES TONIGHT.

49
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,015
- HE FLAKES OUT ON ME
ALL THE TIME,

50
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,250
AND WE FIGHT.

51
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,352
THE PLAN TONIGHT
IS LUCKY CHENG'S,

52
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,221
A RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK CITY

53
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:02,890
THAT OFFERS
A DRAG SHOW DURING IT.

54
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,892
BUT, I FEEL LIKE
I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE

55
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:06,494
THAT TONIGHT'S
GONNA BE A BUST,

56
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:07,828
BECAUSE
OF ME AND ROGER'S FIGHT.

57
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,198
- MM, THAT WAS WORTH IT.

58
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:13,701
- I DIDN'T KNOW A MUFFIN TASTES
SO MUCH BETTER WARM.

59
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:15,035
- AND TOASTED.

60
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:18,206
MM, I ALWAYS DO THAT.

61
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:28,849
- YAY, I'M EXCITED.
CLEANING.

62
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:30,751
- WANT ME TO HELP YOU?

63
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,553
- NO, I'M GONNA CLEAN,
AND THEN I'M GONNA PEE,

64
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:33,987
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO HELP ME PEE.

65
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,789
- CAN I PAINT A PENIS
ON YOUR WALL?

66
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:36,790
- NO.

67
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,991
- ALL RIGHT, MOM.

68
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,928
- DO YOU WANT TO START LAUNDRY
OR ANYTHING?

69
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,597
- I ALREADY DID MY LAUNDRY.
- OH.

70
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,466
- I WONDER IF
OUR FIRE ALARM WORKS?

71
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,768
IT LOOKS OLD.

72
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,136
I THINK WE SHOULD TEST IT OUT.

73
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,671
- NO, I JUST WANT TO CLEAN.

74
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,240
- IT'S, LIKE, BROWN.

75
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,245
DOES THE FIREMEN AUTOMATICALLY
COME, OR YOU CALL THEM?

76
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:58,879
YOU CALL THEM, I FEEL.

77
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,949
DID YOU EVER PULL A FIRE ALARM
IN YOUR HIGH SCHOOL?

78
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,717
- NO.

79
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:07,788
- I DID, AND I NEVER GOT CAUGHT.

80
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:09,323
I'M PIGGING OUT.

81
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:13,394
- I DON'T WANT TO BE THE ONLY
ONE CLEANING THIS WHOLE PLACE.

82
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:19,032
- YOU'RE NOT. RELAX.

83
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,734
I THINK YOU SHOULD CALL ROGER.

84
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,536
SEE IF HE'S STILL BEING
A DOUCHE.

85
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:25,373
IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES HE'S MORE
OF A DAD, LIKE, YELLING AT YOU.

86
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:27,007
- [bleep].

87
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:28,776
I'M GONNA CALL ROGER BACK
RIGHT NOW,

88
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:30,844
BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T KNOW
WHERE OUR RELATIONSHIP STANDS,

89
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,112
AND ON TOP OF IT,

90
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,515
I REALLY DO NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT THIS WEEKEND.

91
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:37,285
[phone ringing]

92
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:38,952
- HELLO?
- I WAS JUST WONDERING

93
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:43,891
IF YOU WERE COMING TONIGHT, SO
I CAN CONFIRM THE RESERVATION.

94
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,125
- HONESTLY, EVERYTHING
YOU SAID TO ME

95
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,395
EARLIER WAS SO MUMBO JUMBO--

96
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:51,064
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW
YOU SOUND, THOUGH?

97
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,333
- OKAY, I'M OUT OF LINE?

98
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,935
OKAY, ENJOY YOUR WEEKEND, JENNI.
HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND.

99
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,970
- BUT YOU KNOW THE ONE THING
THAT HURTS ME THE MOST,

100
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,608
THE [bleep] MOST, IS WHEN
YOU CANCEL ON ME THE DAY OF.

101
00:04:00,608 --> 00:04:01,909
- LOOK WHAT YOU DO TO ME!

102
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,511
WHAT I DO TO YOU--
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!

103
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,513
- WHAT I DO TO YOU, JENNI--
- I DIDN'T EVEN [bleep]--

104
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:06,980
DO ANYTHING, THAT'S THE--
- ISN'T AS [bleep] IN THE--

105
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,482
[bleep] COMPARED
TO WHAT YOU DO TO ME.

106
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,318
- THAT'S THE THING RIGHT HERE,
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

107
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:11,985
DIRECTLY TO YOU.
I APOLOGIZED TO YOU.

108
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,321
- YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING
TO ME, JENNI?

109
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:15,222
- I SAID I'M SORRY.
- WE HAVEN'T HAD--

110
00:04:15,222 --> 00:04:18,892
WE HAVEN'T HAD A YEAR
AND A HALF OF DEBATES

111
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,829
OVER THIS EXACT SAME THING,
AND EVERY SINGLE TIME

112
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,565
YOU HAVE COMPLETELY LIED TO ME?
- I'VE NOT--I JUST SAID SORRY.

113
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:26,166
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

114
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,336
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO,
RUIN THE WEEKEND?

115
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,837
GO BY MYSELF?

116
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,372
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO GO THAT FAR?

117
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:32,906
- BECAUSE YOU INSULT
MY INTELLIGENCE.

118
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,908
- I'M NOT, THOUGH.
THAT'S THE ISSUE.

119
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,844
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING
BESIDES TRYING TO MAKE

120
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,346
[bleep] DINNER RESERVATIONS.

121
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:40,080
- YOU, HONESTLY, HAVE TO HURT

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,883
JENNI'S FEELINGS A LOT
TO HAVE HER CRY,

123
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:45,686
AND RIGHT NOW I WANT
TO SHOOT ROGER IN THE HEAD.

124
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:47,355
- HOW MANY HEATED,
CONTROVERSIAL ARGUMENTS--

125
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,757
- IT DOESN'T MATTER, THOUGH!
LISTEN HOW--

126
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,992
LISTEN TO WHAT
YOU'RE ACTUALLY MAD OVER.

127
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,762
- THAT I'M BEING LIED TO.
THAT'S WHAT I'M MAD OVER.

128
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:59,433
- [crying] MM, I CAN'T--
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

129
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,868
[sniffles]

130
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,936
- I'M GLAD I GOT OUR FAMILIES
AND FRIENDS

131
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:05,238
FOR THIS, UH,
SPECIAL MOMENT TOGETHER.

132
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,540
LET'S ENJOY IT.

133
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,376
- WHAT ABOUT ME?
- OH.

134
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:09,410
[laughter]

135
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,844
- KISS ME.
- OH.

136
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,979
[laughter]

137
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,025
- [crying] MM, I CAN'T--
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

138
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,994
- WELL, OKAY, JENNI, YOU WANT TO
PAINT ME OUT TO BE THE BAD GUY--

139
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:29,397
- I AM NOT PAINTING YOU OUT
TO BE LIKE ANYTHING.

140
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:32,132
I AM ACTUALLY TELLING
YOU YOU'RE RIGHT.

141
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:35,135
I APOLOGIZED.
I SAID I'M SORRY.

142
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:38,271
I TRIED TO MAKE IT
TO HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND.

143
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,240
- FAIR ENOUGH.
I WILL NEED ANSWERS EVENTUALLY,

144
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,643
BUT I'LL LET IT GO FOR NOW.

145
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,211
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU
IN A LITTLE BIT.

146
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,615
- MM, BYE.
- BYE.

147
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:50,283
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- NOTHING, HE'S JUST A [bleep].

148
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:53,053
AT THIS POINT, I DON'T KNOW
IF ME AND ROGER ARE GONNA LAST,

149
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,789
BUT HOW WE'RE COMMUNICATING
RIGHT NOW IS NOW ALL RIGHT,

150
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,559
AND I FEEL LIKE THIS COULD
ACTUALLY PUSH US OVER THE EDGE.

151
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,028
I'M TRYING TO COOL OFF BEFORE
I [bleep]

152
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,664
SAY [bleep] I DON'T MEAN.

153
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,633
[door locks]

154
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:07,134
- OY!

155
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,703
- * THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
I'D RATHER *

156
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:13,874
* SEE PUT UP AGAINST A WALL *

157
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:15,075
* YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG-- *

158
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,744
- CAN YOU GET IT?

159
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:20,614
- IT'S PROBABLY JIONNI.
I SUPPOSE SO.

160
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:21,715
- YO.

161
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,016
- HI, ROG.

162
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:25,285
- HOW ARE YOU?

163
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:26,954
- I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
GONNA SHOW.

164
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,189
- WHY NOT?
- THE SCREAMING-FEST I HEARD.

165
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,223
- I'M TRYING NOT TO LET

166
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,661
MY EMOTIONS GET THE BEST
OF ME RIGHT NOW.

167
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:36,196
- HI.

168
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:38,098
- BUT I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA
HOLD IT TOGETHER THIS WEEKEND.

169
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,333
LIKE, NOTHING
CAN BRIGHTEN MY DAY,

170
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,170
NOTHING CAN MAKE IT BETTER.

171
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,305
- QUIET IN HERE.

172
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:50,678

173
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,279
[doorbell ringing]

174
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,282

175
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,817

176
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,619

177
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,554
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

178
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:01,655
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

179
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:03,356
- JIONNI GETS HERE,
AND IT'S, LIKE,

180
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,894
REALLY SILENT IN THE ROOM,
AND AWKWARD.

181
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,596
- CAN I HAVE A FIBER BAR?

182
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:11,331
- HERE YOU GO.

183
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,633
- IT'S JENNI'S NUVARING.

184
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:13,834
- WHAT IS THAT?
- YOU SMELLED IT. [laughs]

185
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,603
- UGH, I SWEAR TO GOD.
DUDE, I'M LEAVING.

186
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:18,371
[all laughing]

187
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,640
- HE SNIFFED IT, JENNI.
- WHY DO YOU KEEP IT

188
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,041
IN THE REFRIGERATOR.
IT'S WEIRD.

189
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,243
- 'CAUSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE REFRIGERATED.

190
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:25,312
- JIONNI IS SUCH A DORK,

191
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:26,647
BUT THE BOYS WERE LAUGHING,

192
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:29,116
JENNI WAS, LIKE, LAUGHING
WITH THEM, AND, YOU KNOW,

193
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,518
IT PUTS EVERYONE
IN A GOOD MOOD.

194
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:33,020
SO I THINK WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE
A GOOD TIME TONIGHT.

196
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,057
- IT'S A SURPRISE.
- COME ON, ROG.

197
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,027
- A SURPRISE TO JUST ME,
OR A SURPRISE TO ME AND JIONNI?

198
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,530
- THIS IS A FUN SURPRISE.

199
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,532
- WE'RE BRINGING THEM
TO LUCKY CHENG'S.

200
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:47,034
IT'S A DRAG SHOW DINNER PLACE.

201
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,202
THINK I PULLED MY ASS BONE.

202
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,271

[all laughing]

203
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:53,974
- ALL RIGHT, IS THIS INDIAN?
[crowd chattering]

204
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,644
- NO, THIS IS--
IT'S NOT INDIAN.

205
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,879
- WHOSE NAME IS IT UNDER?

206
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,548
- IT'S UNDER MY NAME.
- THAT'S A GUY.

207
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:02,249
THAT WAS A GUY.

208
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:04,151
THAT WAS A GUY, ROG.

209
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,385
- I KNOW.

210
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,120
- IT'S ALL GUYS DRESSED

211
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,689

OH, IT REALLY IS?

212
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,791
- YEAH.

213
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,059
- WAIT, I THOUGHT THIS WAS
A BIG JOKE.

214
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:14,327
THEY REALLY ARE GUYS?
I HAD NO IDEA.

215
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,764
- WE'RE ABOUT TO WATCH
A SHOW.

216
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,198
- NO WONDER ALL THE GIRLS
ARE LOOKING AT ME.

217
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,167
SO THIS SURPRISE
TURNS OUT TO BE

218
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,135
ALL GUYS DRESSED UP AS GIRLS.

219
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,872
- HI, GUYS, HOW ARE YA?
- GOOD.

220
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:26,574
- YOU ALL VIRGINS?
- NOT ME.

221
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:27,575
- ME EITHER, HONEY.

222
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,809

226
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:35,949
- I'M JUST TEASING, HONEY.

227
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,586
- JIONNI AND ROGER'S FACES
RIGHT NOW ARE PRICELESS.

228
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:41,421
I JUST FEEL LIKE THEY'RE
SO UNCOMFORTABLE THAT

229
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:46,193
IT'S CAUSING ME TO SMILE.

230
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,394
- STOP!

231
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,297
BOTH OF THEM, BOTH OF THEM,
BOTH OF THEM.

00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:54,602
[crowd cheering]

233
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:57,437
- HANDS DOWN, LAST TIME JENNI
AND NICOLE ARE EVER

234
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,806
SURPRISING ME AND ROGER.

235
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:00,674
YOU KNOW I HATE YOU.

236
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:02,275

[both laughing]

243
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,202
- I WANT TO RUN OFF STAGE

244
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:32,806
I SEE JENNI, NICOLE, THEY'RE
LAUGHING, HAVING A GOOD TIME,

245
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,675
WHILE I'M GETTING
BRACIOLA IN MY FACE.

246
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,176
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

247
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:37,845
- [laughing]

248
00:09:37,845 --> 00:09:39,246
I WAS LAUGHING SO HARD,
BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING

249
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,015
MORE THAN JERSEY TURNPIKED
BY THESE QUEENS.

250
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,250
LIKE, IT'S PRETTY INTENSE.

251
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,120
- JIONNI, DO YOU LIKE
CHOCOLATE SURPRISE?

252
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,190
[cheers]

253
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,692
- IT GOT A LITTLE CRAZY.
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

254
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:54,361
IT GOT A LITTLE CRAZY,
IT GOT--I WAS A LITTLE SCARED.

255
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,830
IT WAS DEFINITELY THE CRAZIEST
THING I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.

256
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,298
- I NEED A SHOT, RIGHT NOW.

257
00:09:58,298 --> 00:09:59,733
I NEED SOMETHING TO DRINK,
RIGHT NOW.

258
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,069
- I NEED TO WASH MY HANDS.

259
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,338
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU.
- SHE MADE THE RESERVATION.

260
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,444

DIE FOR YOU, LIE FOR YOU *

261
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,647
*AND IF I GOT LOCKED AWAY *

00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:26,626
IT'S GONNA BE OUR FIRST

268
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,461
- ANYTHING WEIRD I SHOULD
BE KNOWING ABOUT GOING IN THERE?

269
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,863

340
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,163
- THANK YOU FOR
ALL THESE BLESSINGS,

341
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,431
AND THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE
AT THIS TABLE.

342
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,099
all: AMEN.

343
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,835
- SALUTE.
- SALUTE.

344
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:51,671
- SALUTE.

345
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53,240
- DELICIOUS, JANICE.
- THANK YOU.

346
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,175
- EVERYTHING YOU CREATED
AT THIS TABLE IS WONDERFUL.

347
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,509
EXCEPT FOR YOUR SON.
[all chuckling]

348
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,246
- OH, COME ON.
- ROGER'S MY GOOD FRIEND.

349
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,680
ROGER MAKES ME FUN
OF ME A LOT.

350
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,183
ROGER CALLS ME UP, HE GOES,
"HEY," HE GOES,

351
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,052
"I GOTTA--I GOTTA DROP
JENNI OFF," HE GOES,

352
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:06,486
"CAN YOU DRIVE ME BACK
TO TOMS RIVER."

353
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:08,321
I SAID, "YEAH, NO PROBLEM."
I SAID, "ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW,

354
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:09,589
I'LL DRIVE YOU BACK."

355
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,690
HE DIDN'T SAY ONE NICE THING
[all laughing]

356
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,392
ABOUT ME THE WHOLE HOUR
AND A HALF.

357
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,461
OH, IT WAS A BAD RIDE.

358
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,997
YOU WANT ANOTHER ONE?
[indistinct chattering]

359
00:13:22,002 --> 00:13:26,239
- THIS LASAGNA BOLOGNESE
WITH THE MEAN IN THERE, YEAH.

360
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,041
- IF YOU LIKE TO EAT,
THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE.

361
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,242
- I DO LIKE TO EAT.

362
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,879
- OH! IS THAT YOU?

363
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,281
- JIONNI, YOU REALLY WANT
TO DO THAT?

364
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,216
- DON'T GIVE ROG THE BABY ONE.
- [laughs]

365
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:37,284
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE, LIKE, ON A--

366
00:13:37,284 --> 00:13:39,486
OH, MY GOD, HOW CUTE ARE YOU?

367
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,554
A BOOGIE BOARD.

368
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,423
I HOPE SHE'S NOT HATING.
- YOUR HEAD'S LIKE 42 POUNDS,

369
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,292
AND THE REST OF YOUR
BODY WEIGHS 12 POUNDS.

370
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:47,260
- OH, MY GOD!

371
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,062
- DO YOU KNOW WHICH ONE'S ME?
- RIGHT HERE.

372
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,463
[all laughing]

373
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,067
OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE LIKE
A LITTLE TINY THING IN THERE.

374
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,603
- WOW, LOOK AT YOUR JUMPSUIT.
- HE'S STANDING WHILE

375
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:59,239
THE PEOPLE ARE SITTING.
- I'M TALL FOR AN ITALIAN, ROG.

376
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,708
- JIONNI'S BABY PICTURES
WERE ADORABLE.

377
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,210
- I WAS A CUTE BABY,

378
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,245
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE
A [bleep] GORGEOUS KID.

379
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,081
[all laughing]

380
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,349
- ALL RIGHT--
- IT WON'T GO OVER.

381
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,951
- PICTURES AWAY.
THAT'S IT. THAT'S ENOUGH.

382
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,352
THE BABY PICTURES--

383
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,722
LOADED ROG WITH AMMUNITION
FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TEN YEARS,

384
00:14:15,722 --> 00:14:16,789
JUST HAMMERING ME.

385
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,926
- JANICE, IT WAS DELICIOUS.

386
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:20,660
- THANK YOU.
- EXCELLENT.

387
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,195
- ROGER!
- WHAT?

388
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:26,967
- COME DOWN.

389
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,335
COME DOWN HERE.
HANG OUT.

390
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:29,502
- I WASH THE DISHES
ALL THE TIME AT OUR HOUSE.

391
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,370
- YOU DO?

392
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,739
- YEAH, I LIKE WASHING.
- OKAY.

393
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:35,575
- NICOLE WANTS
TO WASH ALL THE DISHES.

394
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,778
- TO THE BEST LIFE, COMING UP.
- ABSOLUTELY.

395
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,047
SO WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

396
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,549
ARE YOU REALLY READY FOR
THIS [bleep] MOVE, OR WHAT?

397
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,017
- WHAT MOVE?

398
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,953
- TO FATHERHOOD.
[chuckles]

399
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,988
LIKE YOU--I MEAN,
THAT'S A HUGE THING, BRO.

400
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,522
- OF COURSE I'M READY.

401
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,258
- OBVIOUSLY, I LIKE JIONNI.
HE'S MY FRIEND.

402
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,960
BUT HE'S GOT A CHILD
ON THE WAY,

403
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,594
SO IT'S GONNA BE
A REAL REALITY CHECK.

404
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,330
I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS
EVERYTHING KIND OF LAID OUT

405
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,066
AND PLANNED OUT THE WAY
HE SHOULD YET.

406
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,533
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GONNA DO?

407
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,069
I MEAN, ARE YOU GONNA STAY
HERE AND LIKE--

408
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,236
- UM--

409
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,504
- WHEN SHE HAS THE BABY,
ARE YOU GONNA STAY HERE?

410
00:15:04,504 --> 00:15:05,772
- FOR STARTERS,
I THINK WE'RE GONNA STAY--

411
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,340
BUT IT'S A COMFORT THING,
YOU KNOW, WHY NOT?

412
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,475
- YEAH.
- YOU KNOW, IF MY MOM'S HERE--

413
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,110
- IF YOU HAVE THE BABY,

414
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,245
AND YOU STAY HERE, YOU DEVELOP
THAT COMFORTABILITY FACTOR

415
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,814
WHERE YOU HAVE MOM, YOU KNOW,
THE EASE OF MOM BEING HERE,

416
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,283
- THAT'S--THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.
- HELPING YOU RAISE IT.

417
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,850
THEN YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT
TO GO, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

418
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,386
- I KNOW--I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
- OKAY.

419
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,820
- AND THIS IS
THE RIGHT DECISION.

420
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,323
- I RESPECT YOUR--RESPECT YOUR
CHOICES AND YOUR DECISIONS.

421
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,358
I'M NOT YOUR DAD.
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE.

422
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,426
HAVING A BABY IS GOING
TO BE THE MOST

423
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,495
LIFE-ALTERING EXPERIENCE
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

424
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,430
- NO [bleep], YOU KNOW?

425
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,798
THAT'S WHY I'VE
GOT GREAT EXPERIENCE.

426
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,400
THREE OF MY SIBLINGS
HAVE BABIES.

427
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,035
- I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS
THAT YOU KNOW

428
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,836
EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW
ABOUT CHILD REARING.

429
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:38,471
- TRUST ME, I DO.

430
00:15:38,471 --> 00:15:40,240
- THAT'S A NAIVE STATEMENT,
MY FRIEND.

431
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,408
- YUP.

432
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,676
- IT'S AN EXTREMELY
NAIVE STATEMENT.

433
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,912
- IT'S--SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD
TO HEAR SOMEONE ELSE'S,

434
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:47,180
YOU KNOW, POINT OF VIEW.

435
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,882
BUT, ROG,

436
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,052
YOU'VE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR
RELATIONSHIP, YOU KNOW?

437
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,853
IT'S NOT LIKE YOURS
IS PEACHES AND CREAM.

438
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:56,623
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW,
I'M DOING VERY WELL.

439
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,858
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOURS?

440
00:15:58,858 --> 00:16:00,027
WE'RE ALL SET.

441
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:01,428
WHAT MORE DO WE NEED?

442
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,296
- [laughs] A LOT.

443
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,502
- THERE'S MORE SNOOKI AND JWOWW
ON THE WAY,

444
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:14,207
AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

445
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,942
- YOU'RE AMAZING.
- SEE YOU AGAIN SOON.

446
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,244
- I'LL SEE YOU IN
A LITTLE BIT, BUDDY.

447
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:18,711
- MOM, I REALLY CAN'T WAIT
TO COME ON A SUNDAY.

448
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,047
- YOU'RE NOT
OUT OF TROUBLE YET.

449
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:21,048
- ROG, THANK YOU, HONEY.
- THANK YOU...SO MUCH.

450
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,515
- AS SOON AS
THE POOL'S OPEN.

451
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,284
- SEE YOU SOON.
- THANK YOU AGAIN.

452
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,485
- THANK YOU.
- BYE, ROG.

453
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,220
THE NIGHT'S OVER,
WE SAY OUR GOOD-BYES,

454
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,355
GIVE MY PARENTS
THE HUG AND KISS.

455
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,489
"THANK YOU FOR TONIGHT."

456
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,757
NICOLE AND I ARE OUT.

457
00:16:30,757 --> 00:16:32,625
- NIKKI, DRIVE SAFE, HON.

458
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,964
- WHOO!

459
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,399
- I THINK I OD-ed.

460
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,835
- CLOSE OUR DOOR!
- OH.

461
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,204
"CLOSE OUR DOOR."

462
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,639
- [grunts]

463
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:47,940
MY GOD, I'M SO FULL.

464
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,542
- JENNI.

465
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:51,511
- I JUST NEED A NAP.

466
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,081
- THAT'S A HOT MESS RIGHT THERE,
JUST GOING IMMEDIATELY TO BED.

467
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,483
- SO, I ATE MYSELF
INTO A FOOD COMA.

468
00:16:56,483 --> 00:17:01,554
I'M TIRED, AND INCAPABLE
OF DOING ANYTHING.

469
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,824
- [growls]

470
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,493
- COMING.

471
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,138
- [sighs]

472
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,512
- BABY--MM--STOP.

473
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:28,281
- [whispering]

474
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,717
- [half asleep, mumbles]

475
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,485
BABE, PLEASE DON'T, I JUST--

476
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:35,122
PLEASE?

477
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,534
- [grunts]

478
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,702
I WAKE UP THIS MORNING,
AND I DIDN'T GET LAID.

479
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,404
SO NO SURPRISE THERE.

480
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,905
- AW, THAT MIGHT
BE THE CUTEST THING

481
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,141
I'VE EVER SEEN RIGHT THERE.

482
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,309
- SHH, THAT WAS CUTE, BUDDY.

483
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,377
- WANT ME TO CARRY YOU
TO THE BATHROOM?

484
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,678
[dog barking]
- HUH?

485
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,147
- LOOKED LIKE A LITTLE--
- I'D LIKE YOU TO SEE--

486
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:00,947
CARRY HER, I LIKE--
- LOOKED LIKE A LITTLE

487
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,282
KOALA BEAR CARRYING AN ACORN.

488
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:05,385
DID YOU HAVE SEX LAST NIGHT?
[dog barking]

489
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,719
- THAT'S NONE OF YOUR
[bleep] DAMN BUSINESS.

490
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,854
- I'M ASKING YOU
A [bleep] QUESTION.

491
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,822
YOU WILL ANSWER IT, SIR.
- NO.

492
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,225
- NO, YOU DIDN'T?
- CUDDLED WITH MY FIANCEE, MAN.

493
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,861
- WE DEFINITELY DID NOT.
I CAN ASSURE YOU, IT WAS NOT

494
00:18:14,861 --> 00:18:16,062
FROM LACK OF EFFORT ON MY PART.
- I ALREADY KNEW YOU DIDN'T

495
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,464
DO IT, BECAUSE
THE PLACE WASN'T SHAKING.

496
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,432
- WE HAVE TO STOP AT THE PAWN
STORE ON THE WAY HOME.

497
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,633
TO SEE--
- FOR WHAT?

498
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,768
- TO SEE WHAT I CAN GET
FOR JENNI'S VAGINA,

499
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,536
'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T
USE IT ANYMORE.

500
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,673
- [laughs]
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

501
00:18:26,673 --> 00:18:28,208
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH THIS GUY?

502
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,442
- I CAN'T.

503
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,244
- IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS,
AND I REALLY WANNA--

504
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:34,181
- [laughs]
- ONE EXTREME OR THE OTHER.

505
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,616
- I LIKE GRUMPY ROGER BETTER.
- YEAH, ME TOO.

506
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,385
THE WEEKEND ACTUALLY
WENT PRETTY WELL,

507
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:41,988
FROM THE EXPECTATIONS I HAD
A COUPLE DAYS AGO,

508
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,490
WITH THE HUGE FIGHT
WITH ME AND ROGER.

509
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,325
- BYE.
- YOU LOOK LIKE A PENGUIN.

510
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,926
I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE
OF YOUR BOYFRIEND.

511
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,629
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

512
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:51,398
- AW, SEE, THAT'S TRUE LOVE.
- YOU SHOULD GIVE ROGER A HUG.

513
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:53,900
- I FEEL LIKE WE'RE ABLE
TO END ON A GOOD NOTE,

514
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,269
AND I'M HAPPY WITH THAT.

515
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,771
YOU DIDN'T EVEN SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR--MWAH--CHILDREN.

516
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,240
- YOU'RE A NICE LADY.

517
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,474
- WHY DO YOU NEVER SAY GOOD-BYE
TO YOUR CHILDREN?

518
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,742
- 'CAUSE THEY'RE
MY ADOPTED CHILDREN.

519
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:03,776
I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THEM.
NOBODY DOES.

520
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,213
- I LOVE YOU.

521
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,747
I'M GONNA GO GIVE THEM BACON,

522
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,549
SINCE THEIR FATHER
DOESN'T LOVE THEM.

523
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:16,356
- PUB!
- WHAT?

524
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,890
- WHEN DO YOU WANT TO GO TO EAT?

525
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,092
- WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO LEAVE?
- A.S.A.P.!

526
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:23,230
- ARE YOU DRESSED?
- I'M NOT GETTING DRESSED UP.

527
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,097
IT'S A DINER.
- I THINK I'LL DRIVE.

528
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,299
- LET'S GO.
[dog barking]

529
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,468
ME AND JENNI
LOVE BROWNSTONE DINER,

530
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,637
AND WE JUST NEED SOME PANCAKES
IN OUR LIVES.

531
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,839
- I'M EXHAUSTED FROM THIS WEEK.

532
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,607
- I'VE BEEN EXHAUSTED SINCE
WE MOVED IN.

533
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:35,642
I THINK IT'S MORE LIKE THIS--

534
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,110
DONE!
- YEAH.

535
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,979
WE NEED A VACATION.

536
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,081
- CANCUN!

537
00:19:47,454 --> 00:19:50,423
DO THEY HAVE CREATURES
IN CANCUN?

538
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,424
- LIKE A--

539
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,493
- LIKE A SAFARI.

540
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,994
THAT WOULD BE COOL.
- WE RIDE ON ONE OF THOSE, LIKE,

541
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,264
- SO, LIKE GO AND--
YEAH, THEN WE SEE ANIMALS.

542
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:58,898
- RANGER THINGS?
- YEAH.

543
00:19:58,898 --> 00:20:00,600
SO, I THINK IT WOULD
BE A GREAT IDEA

544
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,436
IF ME AND JENNIE GO TO CANCUN.

545
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:04,837
BECAUSE IT IS SPRING BREAK,
AND I'M SURE

546
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:06,706
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING
ON IN CANCUN.

547
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,675
AND WE CAN SEE ANIMALS,

548
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,910
AND JUST HAVE, LIKE,
A RELAXING WEEKEND.

549
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,479
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

550
00:20:12,479 --> 00:20:14,947
- SINCE WE'RE WITH
THE BOYS ALL THE TIME,

551
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,283
MAYBE IT SHOULD
BE ALL GIRLFRIENDS.

552
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:19,218
SO IT COULD BE LIKE
A GIRLS' WEEKEND.

553
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,287
- I LIKE THAT IDEA.

554
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:22,188
I FEEL LIKE
I SHOULD TAKE YANICE.

555
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,623
- I WANT TO TAKE RYDER.

556
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:24,757
I HAVEN'T REALLY HUNG
OUT WITH HER

557
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,459
SINCE I TOLD HER
I WAS PREGNANT AND ENGAGED.

558
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,560
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

559
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,596
- I REALLY HOPE THEY CAN GO.

560
00:20:29,596 --> 00:20:31,298
- CANCUN!

561
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:34,100
I CAN'T WAIT.

562
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,137
- OH, MY GOD.
- WE'RE IN CANCUN!

563
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:40,106
[all screaming, cheering]

564
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:43,109
- IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD
[bleep] TIME IN CANCUN.

565
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:45,011
- THERE'S A FIGHT BREAKING OUT.
YOU KNOW, GOD FORBID I GOT HURT

566
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,847
AND LOST THE BABY, LIKE,
I'M HONESTLY SCARED.

567
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,048
- NICOLE!

568
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:50,517
- STOP SCREAMING AT ME.

569
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:51,851
- NICOLE IN CANCUN SUCKS.

570
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:52,952
YOU KNOW,
I WISH SHE DIDN'T COME.

571
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,621
- I FEEL BAD.

572
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,290
- [crying] I DON'T THINK I WANT
TO LIVE WITH JENNI ANYMORE.
