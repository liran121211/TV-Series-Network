2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,208
- WHAT'S THE OVER-UNDER

00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,442

[acoustic guitar music]

19
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,478
- * IT'S HOLDING THE WEIGHT

20
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,614
- I'M SO EXCITED.

21
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,382
IT'S A LOT OF
INFORMATION TO TAKE IN.

22
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,418
LIKE, I JUST SAW MY BABY
TWISTING AND TWIRLING.

23
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:52,920

'CAUSE IT LOOKED FINE.

00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,773
WITH MY KNOCKED UP
BEST FRIEND.

- IT'S WEIRD, HOW THINGS WORK.

32
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:20,681
- I THINK WE SHOULD
INVITE THE ROOMMATES OVER.

33
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,684
I DO HAVE IMPORTANT NEWS
TO TELL THEM.

34
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,520

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,523

00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,662
THERE IS, LIKE, NO PLACE
FOR DECORATIONS.

39
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:35,963
WE GOTTA GO TO
THE THRIFT STORE TOMORROW.

40
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:38,432
- WE JUST BOUGHT
A MILLION THINGS OF FABRIC.

41
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,668
- THAT'S NOT DECORATION.

42
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,236
- YEAH, WE COULD
MAKE A DECORATION.

43
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:44,572

00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,635
I'M BASICALLY TAKING CONTROL

63
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:49,470
I WANT A NICE HOUSE,

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,306
AND I WANT THE ROOMMATES TO KNOW

00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:29,743
- THE SHOREHOUSE ROOMMATES
ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME,

83
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,679
AND I FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD
KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

84
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,948
- HELLO.

85
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,884

- I DIDN'T--NO.

102
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,322
I DIDN'T--I'M NOT INVITING HIM.
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

103
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:16,023
- YOU COULDN'T PAY ME ENOUGH
TO [bleep] DO THAT.

104
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,158
AND I'M NOT TALKING
TO MIKE ABOUT MY BUSINESS

105
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:20,060
'CAUSE HE'S NOT MY FRIEND.
[bell ringing]

106
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,031
- I HOPE OUR HANDYMAN'S HOT.

107
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,833

111
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:32,740
- [speaks indistinctly]

112
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,575
- "SEXY BLACK MAN"?

113
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,844
- WHAT YOU'LL HELP WITH
IS DRAPING.

114
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,346
WE BASICALLY NEED
TO BE GUIDOFIED.

115
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:39,713
- OKAY.

116
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,415
DO YOU HAVE, LIKE,
THE BRACKETS

117
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,650
AND THE ATTACHMENTS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT

118
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,984
FOR ALL THIS STUFF OR--

119
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,619
- NO.
- YOU GOT A STAPLE GUN.

120
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,720
- I GOT A STAPLE GUN--
- WILL THAT WORK?

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,788
- YOU CAN'T STAPLE TO THIS.

122
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,357
HOW WE GONNA
STAPLE TO THIS?

123
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,692
- I HAVE NAIL GLUE.
- [laughs]

124
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,561
- YEAH.
- IT'S REALLY STURDY.

125
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:56,263
THANK GOD THAT NOW
WE HAVE A HANDYMAN,

126
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:58,799
SO HE CAN START DECORATING, ME
AND JENNI CAN DO THE PAINTING

127
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,969
AND JUST START GETTING THIS
PLACE, YOU KNOW, READY TO GO.

128
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:05,373
THIS IS WHAT I USED
TO WEAR IN SURGERIES,

129
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,441
WHEN I OPERATED
ON ANIMALS.

130
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:10,378
- I WAS JUST THINKING,
WHAT AM I GETTING PAID FOR THIS?

131
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:14,815
- HUGS AND KISSES.

132
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,550
I JUST STAPLED MY ASS.

133
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,488
- I WANT OUR HOUSE
TO BE A BARBIE'S DREAM HOUSE,

134
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,390
A BARBIE GUIDETTE DREAM HOUSE.

135
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,658
- WHAT'S IT SAY?
- "G."

136
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,561
FOR GARBAGE.

137
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:30,263
- THIS IS MY WAY
OF SEWING CURTAINS.

138
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:33,601
- I THINK NEXT TIME,
I'M GETTING A DECOR...

139
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:36,537
RATOR.
[laughter]

140
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,707
- YOU MEAN AN INTERIOR DESIGNER.
- YEAH.

141
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:42,109
OH, MY GOD, I THOUGHT I WAS
TALKING REALLY SMART.

142
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,812
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE ZOO
IN HERE WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

143
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,414
- BASICALLY.

144
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:47,681
- THAT'S THE POINT.
- [laughs]

145
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,282
- PETA CAN'T GET MAD
AT OUR HOUSE.

146
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:54,321
- IT'S JUST CLOTH.
IT'S NOT LIKE A REAL ZEBRA.

147
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:58,792
UGH.

148
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,194
- ANTHONY,
TELL US A STORY.

149
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,563
- WHAT KIND OF STORY?

150
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,297
- A SEX STORY
THAT WENT WRONG.

151
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,333
- A SEX STORY.
- THAT WENT WRONG.

152
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,101
- YEAH.
- OH.

153
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,236
I GOT A CRAZY STORY
FOR YOU, ACTUALLY.

154
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:10,671
- WHOO-HOO!

155
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,873
- ME AND NICOLE LIKE
TO JOKE AROUND WITH PEOPLE,

156
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,808
AND WE LIKE TO SEE 'EM
BLUSH AND TURN RED.

157
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,444
- YEAH, EMBARRASS PEOPLE.

158
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:18,111
- THE WEIRD THING
ABOUT ANTHONY IS...

159
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,246
- HE LOVED IT.

160
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:22,583
- THIS GIRL--
THIS GIRL--

161
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,552
YOU KNOW, WE WERE [bleep],

162
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:28,321
AND, UH, ALL OF A SUDDEN...

163
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:34,227
YOU KNOW, ME AND MY FRIEND,
HE'S A PRETTY BIG DUDE TOO--

164
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,464
- DID HE [bleep]?

165
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:39,733
- ACTUALLY, SHE DID...

166
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,303
AS WE WERE [bleep].

167
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,005
- AND THAT'S WHEN
IT STARTED GETTING WEIRD.

168
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:47,975
- SHE GOES, "I WANT YOU
TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

169
00:06:47,975 --> 00:06:51,979
I WANT YOU TO [bleep]."

170
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:53,814

171
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:57,217
- I SAID, "NO."
I SAID I'LL [bleep].

172
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,887
THIS WAY, I DON'T HAVE TO SMELL
IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

173
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:02,122
- I CAN'T STAND ANYMORE.

174
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,824
ME AND JIONNI ARE ENGAGED.

175
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,526
all: WHAT?

176
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:08,128
- CAN I SEE THE RING?
- DID YOU BUY IT?

177
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:11,331
[laughter]

178
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,365
- GREAT.

179
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:18,371
- NOW YOU YELL AT HIM.
TELL HIM TO [bleep] HURRY UP.

180
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,507
- WHAT ABOUT
THE CLUBBING DAYS?

181
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,074
I KNOW YOU GOT
CRAZY STORIES FROM THOSE.

182
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,510
- OKAY, WE'RE DONE.

183
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,579
- I KNOW, I PROBABLY MADE YOU
SICK WITH THAT STORY.

184
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:26,914
- NO.
- NOW YOU'RE LIKE,

185
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:29,382
"GET THIS GUY OUT OF HERE.
HE'S A [bleep] NUTCASE."

186
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,519
[clears throat]
ALL RIGHT.

187
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,922
SO WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH
THE MONEY NOW? SERIOUS.

188
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,389
- FRIDAY MORNING.
- I GOT KIDS.

189
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,725
DON'T FOOL AROUND
WITH MY MONEY.

190
00:07:37,725 --> 00:07:39,359
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO COME OVER HERE

191
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,028
LOOKING FOR YOU GUYS,
YOU KNOW?

192
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,196
- I FEEL LIKE HE JUST WANTS
TO TAKE US AWAY.

193
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,598
- YEAH.
- IN HIS DUNGEON.

194
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,733
- ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
HAVE A GOOD WEEK.

195
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:47,835
HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME
AT YOUR PARTY.

196
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,369
- I'M REALLY SCARED RIGHT NOW.
- ME TOO.

197
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:52,640
- ENJOY.
I'LL BE BY TO COLLECT.

198
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,876
- EW, HE GOT SO CREEPY.
- YEAH, LIKE, WEIRD.

199
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:58,178
[groans]
- I WANT TO GO TO SLEEP NOW.

200
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,714
- IT LOOKS
REALLY COOL IN HERE.

201
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:03,083
NOW I KNOW HOW
A HARDWORKING MAN FEELS.

202
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:06,386
- IF IT'S NOT GONNA BE DONE
TOMORROW, IT'LL BE DAMN CLOSE.

203
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,055
- ROME WASN'T
BUILT IN A DAY.

204
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,090
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SAY THAT.

205
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,726
MM.

206
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,595
- THE DRAPES AREN'T
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID,

207
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,964
BUT MAYBE WE JUST CAN'T GET 'EM
THE WAY WE WANT THEM.

208
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,766
- BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS.
- MM-HMM.

209
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:21,001
- I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SAY THAT ONE TOO.

210
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:26,006
JENNI, I'M GOING TO SLEEP.
GOOD NIGHT.

211
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,076
- * DON'T BE LAZY,
DON'T BE SHY *

212
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,278
* HOLD MY HAND
AND KISS THE NIGHT GOOD-BYE *

213
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,814
* OPEN YOUR EYES,
STAY BY MY SIDE *

214
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:35,616
- ARE YOU UP?

215
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:38,385
BOO, IT'S 11:00.

216
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,354
- I'M SO TIRED.

217
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,656
- OUR PICTURE GUY'S COMING,

218
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:44,725
SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE'RE WEARING.

219
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:46,093
READY?

220
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:49,329
ME AND NICOLE WANT BIG PAINTINGS
TO COVER UP THE UGLY WALL.

221
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,498
HEY, NICK.
- HI, ARE YOU JENNI?

222
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,800
- YEAH. COME IN, IT'S COLD.
- OH, THANKS.

223
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,636
- I FOUND NICK'S NUMBER
AT A DEPARTMENT STORE,

224
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:59,740
AND I CALLED HIM TO SEE IF
HE CAN PAINT PICTURES OF US.

225
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,976
THIS IS OUR PAINTER.
- HE LOOKS LIKE AN ARTIST.

226
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:06,213
- SO THESE ARE
JUST SOME OF MY FRIENDS.

227
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,181
WE LIKE TO GO TO THRIFT STORES
AND FIND, LIKE, OUTFITS,

228
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,450
AND THEN I PAINT THEM.

229
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,619
- SEXY.
- VERY SEXY.

230
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,353
[laughs]
AND THEN--

231
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,521
- YOU TAKE A PICTURE OF THEM
AND THEN YOU DRAW IT?

232
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,890
- YEAH.
- 'CAUSE WE THOUGHT WE'D HAVE TO

233
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,358
SIT THERE FOR,
LIKE, THREE HOURS.

234
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,928
- IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD
TO SIT STILL FOR AN HOUR.

235
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:24,164
- TWO PICTURES OF US
LOOKING MAD HARD

236
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:29,803
WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE
THE APARTMENT.

237
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:33,707
- HEY, PUPPY.
[clicks tongue]

238
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,679
SATURDAY MORNING'S OKAY?
both: YES.

239
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,682
- WONDERFUL, GREAT. WELL, IT
WAS NICE TO MEET BOTH OF YOU.

240
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:44,885
- IT'S GONNA LOOK SICK.
- I'M GONNA GET CHANGED.

241
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,956
READY?
- YEP.

242
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:51,725
TONIGHT, THE ROOMMATES ARE
COMING OVER, SO ME AND JENNI

243
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,862
HAVE A BUSY, BUSY DAY
AHEAD OF US WITH SHOPPING...

244
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,429
DOES DIET MEAN
IT'S NON-CAFFEINE,

245
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,065
OR IT'S JUST
LESS CAFFEINE?

246
00:09:58,065 --> 00:10:00,668
- YEAH, IT'S LESS.

247
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:03,270
- I HAVE NO IDEA HOW
THE ROOMMATES ARE GONNA REACT.

248
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,405
I'M GONNA TELL THEM
I'M ENGAGED FIRST,

249
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:08,108
BUT I ALSO WANT A COOL WAY
OF SAYING I'M PREGNANT.

250
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,711
- WE WANT TO MAKE, LIKE,
A REALLY, REALLY NICE CAKE.

251
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:11,912
- OKAY.

252
00:10:11,912 --> 00:10:14,214
- BUT WE WANT TO PUT
A SPECIAL MESSAGE ON IT.

253
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:18,451
- I'M PREGNANT.
DIG IN!

254
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,328
JENNI, LOOK!
- OH, NO.

255
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:31,231
- I LOOK UP, AND ALL THE DRAPES
ARE FALLING DOWN.

256
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,733
WHAT THE [bleep]
ARE WE GONNA DO NOW?

257
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:35,368
BECAUSE NOW THE HOUSE
LOOKS LIKE [bleep].

258
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,005
NOT IN THE MOOD
TO DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

259
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,506
LET'S CANCEL.

260
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:40,573
- IT'S GONNA
TAKE TWO HOURS

261
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,609
JUST TO CLEAN UP
THIS TAPE OFF THE WALL.

262
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:43,711
- IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

263
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:48,481
I DON'T WANT THEM
OVER ANYMORE.

264
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:54,788
- IT LOOKS HORRIBLE.
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

265
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:59,059
- BUZZKILL.

266
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,094
- OW!

267
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:02,763
[pained groan]

268
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,131
[muffled]
HOW DOES THAT LOOK?

269
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,399
- EH.
I'M GONNA LOOK ONLINE

270
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,737
AND SEE IF THERE'S MORE
HANDY PEOPLE AROUND HERE.

271
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,171
"HANDYMAN."

272
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:15,042
I FEEL LIKE
I'M LOOKING UP PROSTITUTES.

273
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:19,179
ALL RIGHT, POOP, I FOUND
FOUR OTHER HANDYMANS.

274
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,447
- START CALLING.

275
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:23,350
SEE WHO CAN GET HERE
THE FASTEST.

276
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,018
[burps]

277
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,587
[phone ringing]

278
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:30,791

279
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:33,560

280
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,996
[phone ringing]

281
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,999
- HELLO.

282
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,801
- I AM A HANDYMAN.

283
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,936
- OH, MY GOD,
ARE YOU AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW?

284
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:45,038
THIS ONE GUY
SOUNDS PROFESSIONAL,

285
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,408
SO HE'S NOT GONNA
TALK ABOUT [bleep].

286
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,343
[bell rings]
YAY!

287
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:51,611
HI.
- HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?

288
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,346
I'M BRIAN THE HANDYMAN.

289
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,982
- HOW ARE YOU?
HI, PUPPY--

290
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,785
OH, [bleep].
- NOEL!

291
00:11:57,785 --> 00:12:02,856
- [laughs]

292
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:04,691
JESUS.
[laughs]

293
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,895
- YOU ARE GONNA GET YOUR ASS
HANDED TO YOU.

294
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,931
OUR DAY'S GETTING WORSE.
- HE DOESN'T SEEM CREEPY.

295
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,501
- UH, HI, HOW ARE YOU?
IT'S...INCREDIBLY PINK.

296
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,269
- THEY WERE DRAPED
ALL THE WAY UP TOP,

297
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:17,670
AND NOW THEY JUST SAG.

298
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,140
- SO YOU JUST WANNA
HANG THE DRAPES, RIGHT?

299
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,541
- YEAH.
- JUST KINDA MAKE IT NICE?

300
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,310
- NICE AND DROOPY.

301
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:26,579
BASICALLY, IT'S THE LAST HOUR
BEFORE THE ROOMMATES GET HERE.

302
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,115
I DON'T KNOW IF
WE'RE GONNA PULL THIS OFF.

303
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:31,484
LET'S DO THIS.

304
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,820
OUR CAKE'S HERE.

305
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,721
- YEAH, THEY'LL

306
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:39,860
NO!

307
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,662
- REALLY?
NOTHING'S GOING RIGHT RIGHT NOW.

308
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,464
[container plops]
- [gasps]

309
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:46,633

310
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:49,702

311
00:12:49,702 --> 00:12:51,538
- OH, MY GOD,

312
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:54,842
- SO I'LL GET OUT OF HERE.
ENJOY YOUR PARTY.

313
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,376
- YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.
- LOVE YOU.

314
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:59,112
- LOVE YOU BACK.

315
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,014

[doorbell rings]

319
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,288
- UH-OH.

320
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,590
- YOU GET IT.

321
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,425
- [bleep] YOUR GREEN BEANS.
GO ANSWER THE DOOR.

322
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,227
- WHY DO YOU BOSS ME AROUND?

323
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:15,863
- I'M NOT BOSSING YOU AROUND,
BUT I'M TRYING TO TAKE OUT--

324
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:16,897
- YOU ALWAYS BOSS ME AROUND.
- ALL RIGHT.

325
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:22,469
- "DO THIS, DO THAT,
RAH, RAH, RAH."

326
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,704
HELLO?

332
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,615
I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE PAULY

333
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,351
BECAUSE PAULY ALWAYS

334
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,287
LIKE, YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE
I'M BACK AT THE SHORE.

335
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,555
- YO, I CALLED THE ANIMAL PRINT.

336
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,191
- OBVIOUSLY.
- CALLED IT.

337
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,725
THE STYLE OF THIS HOUSE IS,
LIKE, AN ART DECO.

338
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:47,094
NO.
[laughs]

339
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,761
IT'S JUST
SNOOKI AND JENNI.

340
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,931
IT'S JUST ANIMAL PRINT
AFTER ANIMAL PRINT.

341
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,232
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY MORE ANIMAL PRINT

342
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,167
LEFT IN JERSEY RIGHT NOW.
IT'S ALL IN THIS HOUSE.

343
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,202
- WE GOT A NICE CAKE
FOR DESSERT.

344
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:57,304
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING COOKING?

345
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,072
[laughs]
- IT'S THE FIRST TIME ON MY OWN!

346
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:00,307
I HAVE TO LEARN SOMETIME.

347
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:04,377
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO DO THIS?

348
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:08,916
[doorbell rings]

349
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,918
- HELLO?

350
00:14:10,918 --> 00:14:13,153
- HEY. HEY.

351
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,154
WE'RE HERE TO DROP OFF
THE FURNITURE.

352
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:17,190
- OH!
OUR FURNITURE IS HERE.

353
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,126
- YAY, OUR FURNITURE'S HERE.

354
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,727
- SAY WHAT?
NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

355
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,829
I'M UNWRAPPING FURNITURE,
I'M PUTTING TOGETHER CHAIRS.

356
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,932
I DON'T KNOW,
THIS WASN'T WHAT I EXPECTED.

357
00:14:24,932 --> 00:14:27,634
THAT'S YOUR COFFIN WHEN
YOU PASS AWAY, GOD FORBID.

358
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:28,668
- OOH!
- I KNOW.

359
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:29,802
- [laughs]

360
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,838
- COULD I FIT IN THERE?
- COURSE YOU DO.

361
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,507
- LET ME SEE.
- THAT'S GREAT.

362
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:37,945
- WHEN I DIE, I WANNA DIE
IN A ZEBRA COFFIN.

363
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,947
- [chuckles]
- WHY YOU LAUGHING?

364
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,014
- JUST TAKE THE OTTOMAN.

365
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,382
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED
TO BUY A COFFIN.

366
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,451
- I KNOW, BUT THEN THE BUGS
CAN GET IN AND EAT ME.

367
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,053
- OH, THIS IS GREAT.
- R.I.P.

368
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:48,288
- GOD REST YOUR SOUL.

369
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:49,990
[laughter]
- IF SHE TOOK HER HEELS OFF,

370
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,424
SHE'D BE ABLE TO FIT
ALL THE WAY IN.

371
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,060
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO COME UP
LIKE A MUMMY, LIKE THIS.

372
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,262
- I'LL TAKE IT.
- [droning]

373
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,429
ARISE FROM THE DEAD.

374
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:57,797
- DUDE, I REALLY WANT
MY COFFIN LIKE THIS.

375
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,466
- [laughs]

376
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,772
- THERE'S MORE
SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW ON THE WAY,

377
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,741
AND IT STARTS
RIGHT NOW.

378
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,383
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS PLACE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

379
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,285
WAIT, WAIT, IS THIS IT?

380
00:15:18,285 --> 00:15:19,987
I WAS EXPECTING IT
TO BE DIFFERENT.

381
00:15:19,987 --> 00:15:22,489
- OH, YEAH, NEW RUG.
YEAH, BUDDY, NEW RUG.

382
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,890
[doorbell rings]
- YAY!

383
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,292
- OH, WE'RE AT
THE WRONG APARTMENT.

384
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,759
- I DON'T KNOW.

385
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,028
- HELLO!
- AAH!

386
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,663
- OH, MY GOD!

387
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,764
[indistinct chatter]

388
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,765

395
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,477
- OH, I BROUGHT
A HOUSEWARMING GIFT.

396
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,046
- WINE!

397
00:15:46,046 --> 00:15:47,447
- YUM.

398
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,749
- SO I'M DRINKING
CRANBERRY JUICE

399
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:51,284
OUT OF A WINE GLASS
RIGHT NOW,

400
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,086
BECAUSE IF I WASN'T
DRINKING ANYTHING,

401
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,722
EVERYBODY WOULD BE LIKE, YOU

427
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,074
- SNOOKS, CAN WE USE
YOUR BED REAL QUICK?

428
00:16:47,074 --> 00:16:48,941

429
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,377

00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:51,678

[laughter]

432
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,488

IS CRAZY TO ME

502
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,988
JUST BECAUSE, LIKE,
I FEEL LIKE SHE HASN'T

503
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,225
REALLY KNOWN JIONNI
FOR THAT LONG.

504
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,392
AND THEY'RE GETTING
ENGAGED ALREADY?

505
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:22,629
THAT'S, LIKE,
SERIOUS [bleep], I FEEL.

506
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,331
- I'M A LITTLE
UPSET ABOUT THIS.

507
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,433
- ARE YOU?
- YOU THINK TWO YEARS IS

508
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:28,134
A LONG ENOUGH TIME
TO MARRY SOMEBODY

509
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,869
AND SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR DAYS WITH?

510
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,904
- YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE PERSON FOR
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, RIGHT?

511
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,006
RIGHT, SNOOK?
- YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE PENIS

512
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,007
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE, RIGHT?

513
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,343
- I LOVE HIS PENIS.
- OOH.

514
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,345
- JIONNI WAS A ONE-NIGHT STAND
OF NICOLE.

515
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:41,013
LIKE, ENGAGED MEANS THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE TYPE OF [bleep].

516
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,616
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT TO SOMEBODY
YOU [bleep] ONE-NIGHT STOOD?

517
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:46,586
THAT'S CRAZY.
HOW DOES HE FEEL ABOUT IT?

518
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:47,887
- HE'S SO EXCITED.

519
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:49,689
- DID JIONNI FINISH SCHOOL YET?
- NO.

520
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,090
- CAN I SEE THE RING?

521
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,460
DID SHE BUY IT?
- [laughs]

522
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,964
STOP.
[laughter]

523
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:59,131
- GREAT.

524
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,967
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
TO BUST MY BALLS ABOUT,

525
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:02,869
AND THE FACT THAT JENNI IS,
LIKE, CHIMING IN WITH THEM--

526
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,372
I'M LIKE,
"BITCH, REALLY?"

527
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,606
- JUST GET IT OVER WITH,
DO IT.

528
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:10,109
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
BE DIVORCED SOON ANYWAY.

529
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:11,278
- WOW.

530
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:13,212
- I KIND OF REGRET

531
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,481
EVEN INVITING
THE ROOMMATES OVER

532
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:18,685
BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST
TREATING IT LIKE A JOKE.

533
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:20,253
- OH, BOY.

534
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:23,723
- I'M NOT EVEN EXCITED
TO TELL THEM I'M PREGNANT

535
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,058
BECAUSE OF THE REACTION I GOT
SAYING I'M ENGAGED.

536
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,428
- AWKWARD.
[chuckles]

537
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,063
- UGH, WORST TIME OF MY LIFE.

538
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,668
- WOW, IT IS FANCY.
- WHAT'S IT SAY?

539
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,870
- "BY THE WAY,
I'M PREGNANT."

540
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,939
- HOLY [bleep]! WHAT?
- OH, MY GOD.

541
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:41,140
- YOU'RE PREGNANT?
- OH, [bleep].

542
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,842
both: IT'S NOT YOURS!

543
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:46,346
- I FEEL LIKE ROGER JUST DOESN'T
KNOW WHEN ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

544
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,747
- I'VE HAD CHLAMYDIA
FOUR TIMES.

545
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:49,916
- HE'S RIGHT NEXT TO MY DAD.

546
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,518
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- ALL RIGHT.

547
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:53,219
JIONNI WANTS
TO CHALLENGE ME.

548
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:56,122
I'M GONNA BREAK THIS KID LIKE
A TWIG, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
