JENNI HAS BEEN
MY BEST FRIEND.

00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,248
- DON'T TELL ANYBODY.

7
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,249
- NO ONE'S
LOOKING AT YOU.

8
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,484
- STOP IT!

00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:19,220

BOO, IT'S LIKE AN EMERGENCY.

I HAVE TO GO HOME
AND GET MY DOGS.

17
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:35,436
WILL YOU TAKE THE DRIVE WITH ME?
- OF COURSE.

18
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,738
I WILL ALWAYS BE THERE
FOR JENNI NO MATTER WHAT.

00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:39,673

WE'RE, LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,
WE NEED TO LIVE TOGETHER."

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,146
CAN WE PLEASE HAVE
THESE THERAPY SESSIONS?

23
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:46,714
- YEAH.
- AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK.

I'M [bleep] UP.

WHY ARE YOU SO CREEPY?

ABOUT TO HIT 30

IN A COUPLE YEARS,
AND THAT'S IT.

00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,929
I AM INTERESTED
IN THE TWO-BEDROOM

46
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,732
YOU HAVE AVAILABLE
ON YOUR WEBSITE.

47
00:01:38,732 --> 00:01:41,369
30 IS MY LIMIT,
SO I HAVE THREE YEARS

48
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,204
FOR LIKE A BUCKET LIST
TO GET EVERYTHING DONE.

49
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:46,174
- SO YOU WANT THE ONE-BEDROOM
OR THE TWO-BEDROOM?

50
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:47,308
OR WE HAVE
A THREE-BEDROOM.

51
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,009
- I WOULD PREFER
A TWO-BEDROOM.

52
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,611
IT'S GONNA BE FOR ME
AND MY GIRLFRIEND.

53
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,613
- OH, YEAH, WE DON'T HAVE
A TWO-BEDROOM.

54
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,815
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE AGAIN?

55
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,050
- WE HAVE A ONE-BEDROOM
AND A TWO-BEDROOM

56
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,986
AND A THREE-BEDROOM.

57
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:00,254
- [laughing]
- NOT THE TWO-BEDROOM.

58
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,889
- WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO TAKE A [bleep]-HOLE.

59
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:03,357
WE WANT TO LIVE THERE.

60
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,193
IT AIN'T EASY FINDING A PLACE
IN THE CITY.

61
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:06,494
- UM, THERE'S DEFINITELY
SOME PROPERTIES

62
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:07,495
THAT WE CAN SHOW YOU.

63
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:09,230

00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,199
- DO THEY BARK A LOT?
- NO, NOT AT ALL.

65

- RIGHT.

74
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,655
I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO BE
ONE OF THOSE KIDS

00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,089
THAT ARE, LIKE,
40 YEARS OLD,

THEY STILL LIVE
WITH THEIR PARENTS,

LIKE BEING 24, LIKE,

I'M ALMOST AT THAT POINT
WHERE I'M GONNA BE

79

ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE,

80
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:44,465
SO WE NEED TO CUT
THE UMBILICAL CORD

81
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:46,434
AND I NEED TO GO
AND LIVE ON MY OWN.

82
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:47,768
- MORNING.
- MORNING.

83
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:52,240
UM, I KIND OF WANT TO GET
MY OWN PLACE WITH JENNI.

BUT I'M 24 AND I'M STILL
LIVING HERE.

ALL MY FRIENDS ARE MOVED OUT
IN THEIR OWN APARTMENTS,

88
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:05,253
AND, YOU KNOW, I KIND OF WANT
TO BE ON MY OWN WITH JENNI.

89
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:06,720
- AND WHERE WOULD YOU FIND
A PLACE TO LIVE?

90
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,356
- JERSEY.
- OF COURSE.

91
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:09,790
- WELL, SOMEWHERE
IN JERSEY OBVIOUSLY.

92
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,660
- SOMEWHERE IN JERSEY?
WHO'S GONNA DO ALL THE SHOPPING

93
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,127
AND THE LAUNDRY?
THAT'S NOT YOUR STYLE.

YOU'RE, LIKE, THE BUZZ KILL

I WENT GROCERY SHOPPING BEFORE.

- YOU GONNA SPLIT THE FOOD BILL
DOWN THE MIDDLE?

WHAT'S THE WORD--

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,742
- YOU GONNA BUY YOUR OWN--
- IT'S--IS "KOSHER" THE RIGHT--

102
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,110
THE RIGHT WORD
FOR JENNI?

103
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:33,981
- I DO KNOW THAT THAT'S THE FOOD
THAT JEWISH PEOPLE EAT.

104
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:38,286
- [laughing]
NO, JENNI--JENNI'S NOT--

105
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:40,153
- JENNI'S NOT JEWISH.
[laughing]

106
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,522
- WHOOPS.
- WHOOPS.

107
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:45,426
- SEE, I THINK KOSHER FOOD
IS, LIKE, ORGANIC, HEALTHY FOOD.

108
00:03:45,426 --> 00:03:47,928
BUT JEWISH PEOPLE
EAT ORGANIC FOOD TOO.

SO I FEEL LIKE
IT'S ALL IN THE SAME.

110
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:53,301

JENNI EVERYTHING

111

BEFORE YOU DECIDE
TO MOVE IN, AND...

112
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,170
- I DIDN'T REALLY
TELL JENNI YET.

113
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,306
- OH.

114
00:03:58,306 --> 00:03:59,540
- BUT I'LL TELL HER
WHEN I SEE HER.

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,409
- SHE'LL BE OKAY,
AND YOU'LL TALK IT OUT

116
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:03,411
BEFORE YOU MAKE
THIS COMMITMENT?

117
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:07,348
- SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND,
AND, YOU KNOW, SHE GETS IT.

00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:09,517
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT
TELLING JENNI MY SECRET,

119
00:04:09,517 --> 00:04:11,652
JUST BECAUSE I'M SCARED
THAT SHE'S GONNA

120
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,488
CALL OFF ME AND HER
LIVING TOGETHER.

121
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,989

"NO, BITCH."

THAT ROGER MAY NOT TAKE
THIS WHOLE MOVE POSITIVE,

BUT I HOPE
HE'S READY FOR IT.

I DON'T KNOW
THAT IT'S A GREAT IDEA,

I GOT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
I MEAN...

NICOLE'S A HANDFUL,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

AND--AND YOU KNOW
I LOVE NICOLE.

00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:47,555
AND YOU THINK THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA HONESTLY?

138
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:48,856
- YES AND NO.

00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,958

HELP OUR RELATIONSHIP?

DO YOU THINK THAT'S GONNA HELP
YOUR AND NICOLE'S RELATIONSHIP?

- YES, BUT, YOU KNOW,
DO WHAT WE GOTTA DO.

142
00:04:56,697 --> 00:04:58,366
- DEFINE "DO WHAT
WE GOTTA DO."

143
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:00,834
THAT COULD MEAN GANGBANGS,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

WHAT IS "DO WHAT
WE GOTTA DO"?

IT'S, LIKE,
COMING OFF BAD.

TO PUT THIS

148

THAT YOU JUST WANT
ONE LAST HURRAH OR SOMETHING?

149
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,978

168
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,951
- IF ROGER DOES ANYTHING
WHEN I'M GONE,

169
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:52,453
HIS [bleep] WILL
BE ABOVE MY FIREPLACE.

170
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,287
LIKE, LET'S GET REAL.

171
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:55,989
- THERE'S GONNA BE THE WORLD'S
BIGGEST STRIPPER POLE IN THERE.

172
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,258
JUST SAYING.
- [clicks tongue]

173
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,760
- STRIPPERS NEED LOVE TOO.

174
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,028
- WORST CASE--
AS FAST AS I MOVE IN

175
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,329
IS AS FAST
AS I MOVE OUT.

176
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:05,699
- I GUESS. THAT'S ONE WAY
TO LOOK AT IT.

177
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,868
- I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU

178
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,439
THAT, UM, I REALLY WANTED
TO TELL YOU FOR, LIKE, A WHILE.

179
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,441
I'M PREGNANT.

180
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,443
AND ENGAGED.

181
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,154
- NICOLE?

182
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:31,459
- CRICKETS.

183
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:34,027
OH, MY GOD,
EVERY TIME MY DAD WALKS IN

184
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,163
WITH THAT STUPID
BLACK FILING CABINET,

185
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:38,331
I'M JUST, LIKE, THIS ISN'T
GONNA BE A FUN CONVERSATION.

186
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:39,700
I'M, LIKE, "GO AWAY."

187
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,870
- THIS ISN'T GONNA BE
A SUMMER HOUSE

188
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,705
LIKE YOU GUYS DID
AT THE JERSEY SHORE.

189
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,574
THIS IS GONNA BE
YOUR PLACE TO LIVE.

190
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,976
- THANK YOU, CAPTAIN OBVIOUS,
I KNOW.

191
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,044
- I GUESS THERE'S SOME THINGS
WE OUGHTA PROBABLY GO THROUGH.

192
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,913
- WHAT ARE YOU EVEN
TAKING OUT RIGHT NOW?

193
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,515
- WELL, I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
SOME OF THE STUFF--

194
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,783
- YOU HAVE YOUR FILES?

195
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,384
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO SET THIS STUFF UP.

196
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,853
THIS IS ALL STUFF THAT YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF.

197
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:03,791
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE RENT,
INSURANCE, GAS, ELECTRIC.

198
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,258
- SAY WE DON'T PUT
ANY LIGHT BULBS ON...

199
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,327
AND WE USE CANDLES.

200
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,296
SEE, IT WOULD ACTUALLY
SAVE A LOT OF MONEY,

201
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,531
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

202
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,199
I MEAN, I KNOW A LOT
OF AMISH PEOPLE DO IT.

203
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,602
THEY DON'T USE ELECTRICITY.
AND THEY'RE RICH, I FEEL.

204
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,837
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN
FREAKING COMPANIES.

205
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:17,838
LIKE, EVERYWHERE.

206
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,239
- THE SEWER BILL.

207
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:20,974
- YOU HAVE TO PAY
FOR TAKING A [bleep]?

208
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,510
- GO DO YOUR LOOKING,

209
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,311
BUT DON'T GO
SIGNING ANYTHING,

210
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:25,946
AND LET ME
LOOK AT IT FIRST.

211
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,315
DON'T SIGN NOTHING.

212
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,349
ZERO.

213
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,884
- WELL, YOU MAKE IT SEEM
REALLY HARD.

214
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:33,386
IF YOU CAN DO IT,
I'M SURE A MONKEY CAN DO IT.

215
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,088
- OH, GEE, THANK YOU.
- [giggling]

216
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:37,324
- THANK YOU. THAT'S WHY YOU GOT
WHAT YOU GOT, RIGHT?

217
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,392
- WE'LL SEE.
- YEAH, WE WILL SEE.

218
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,295
OH, GOD.

219
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,967
[computer beeping]

220
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,703
- OOPS.

221
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,704
[computer beeping]

222
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,839
- GOOD GIRL.

223
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,173
- HI!

224
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,644
ME AND JENNI ARE BOTH READY
TO FIND AN APARTMENT.

225
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,746
SO, YOU KNOW, THE FACT
THAT WE'RE BOTH READY

226
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:01,048
TO MAKE THIS COMMITMENT,
IT'S REALLY EXCITING.

227
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,651
WHAT'S UP, POOP?
- NOTHING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

228
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,886
- NOTHING.
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

229
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,455
- AWW. I'M LOVING THE BOW.

230
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,557
- YOU LOOK PALE.

231
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,191
- [bleep] ME.

232
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,561
- WELL, I LOOK CUTE.

233
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:15,028
- AND IT'S BEGUN.

234
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,630
GUESS WHAT?
- WHAT?

235
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,732
- I TALKED
TO REALTORS TODAY.

236
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,568
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

237
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:22,770
I THINK WE SHOULD GO LOOK
FOR APARTMENTS TOMORROW.

238
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,138
I GAVE THEM, LIKE,
A GENERIC...

239
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,775
ALLOWS ANIMALS,
TWO-BEDROOM--

240
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:29,843
- YOU'RE BRINGING
YOUR DOGS?

241
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,412
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I JUST SAID "ALLOWING ANIMALS."

242
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,947
- I GUESS.

243
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:35,248
THE ONLY THING
I'M WORRIED ABOUT

244
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,651
IS THEY POOP AND PEE
EVERYWHERE,

245
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:40,153
SO AS LONG AS THEY DON'T
DO THAT ON MY THINGS,

246
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:41,421
I THINK WE'LL BE FINE.

247
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,024
- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT GOING
IN THE CITY

248
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,894
AT 9:00 IN THE MORNING?
- WAIT, WHAT?

249
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:48,461
- DUDE, THIS GUY
STARTS EARLY.

250
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,598
- IF YOU BRING ME A BAGEL,
I GUESS I'LL COME.

251
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:52,733
- [laughing]
I'LL BRING YOU A BAGEL.

252
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:55,302
- ALL RIGHT, WELL...

253
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,104
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

254
00:08:57,104 --> 00:09:00,440
LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU, BYE.

255
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,410
MOMMY'S AS WHITE AS YOU.

256
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,479

257
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:10,517
* *

258
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,452
- [shivering] CHILLY.

259
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,655
I [bleep] LOOK PALE.

260
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,757
BAGEL, BAGEL, BAGEL.

261
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:19,359
* *

262
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,429
GPS voice: THE ROUTE
GUIDANCE WILL START NOW.

263
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,633
NEXT, SHARP RIGHT.
THEN RIGHT TURN.

264
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,501
- [bleep], THIS IS IT.
SEE, I CAN'T DO THIS.

265
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,371
[bleep], ONE WAY [bleep].

266
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,372
OH, A SPEED BUMP.

267
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,506
OKAY...

268
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,543
"DO NOT ENTER"?
WHICH WAY DO I GO?

269
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:41,348
- MM...
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

270
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:45,352
[knocking,
shaking door knob]

271
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,987
- GOD, I ALMOST HIT
THAT CAR.

272
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:50,323
- AM I THE ONLY ONE
ON TIME?

273
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,660
IS THIS SERIOUSLY HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW?

274
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,929
OBVIOUSLY NOBODY'S
ON TIME. FIGURES.

275
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,800
OH...IT'S SO COLD.
[phone ringing]

276
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,802
- STOP CALLING ME.
LIKE, I'M ALMOST THERE.

277
00:10:01,802 --> 00:10:04,337
IT'S CALLED TRAFFIC,
AND IT'S CALLED THE CITY.

278
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:07,007
[phone ringing]

279
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:09,109
- THIS IS A REALLY [bleep]
START TO HOUSE HUNTING,

280
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:11,411
BECAUSE I'M LITERALLY, LIKE,
ON THE STAIRS

281
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:13,380
OF THE FIRST LOCATION
LIKE A HOMELESS PERSON.

282
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,582
I HAVE TO PEE,
I'M FREEZING,

283
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,017
AND I FEEL LIKE
IT'S ABOUT TO RAIN.

284
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:19,352
[phone ringing]

285
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:20,788
- HI, YOU'VE REACHED
THE VOICEMAIL OF--

286
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,323
- OKAY, DOUCHEBAG.

287
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:26,359
- OH, MY GOD.
NOW I'M LOST.

288
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:29,797
- OH, MY GOD, I'M GONNA [bleep]
PUNCH NICOLE IN THE FACE.

289
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:31,231
AND THEN I'M GONNA PUNCH
THE REALTOR.

290
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,333
- IS THAT
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING?

291
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,540
- I DON'T LIKE
ANYBODY ANYMORE.

292
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,809
THERE SHE [bleep] IS.

293
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,477
IN HER RIDICULOUSLY
GHETTO TRUCK.

294
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,646
[horn honking]

295
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,316
- NICOLE SHOWS UP FIRST.
I'M KIND OF IMPRESSED,

296
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:51,018
'CAUSE I REALLY THOUGHT
THE REALTOR WOULD'VE BEEN FIRST.

297
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,253
CAN I GET IN YOUR TRUCK
'CAUSE I'M [bleep] FREEZING?

298
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,521
'CAUSE YOU
TOOK FOREVER?

299
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,725
- WHY, IS HE NOT HERE?
- NO, NOBODY'S HERE.

300
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:00,160
OH...I LOVE YOU.
- WHERE'S YOUR CAR?

301
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,762
- IT'S BACK THERE.

302
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:04,564
- SO I HAVE TO PARALLEL?
- YEAH, I WANT TO SEE THIS.

303
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,599
- I NEVER REALLY
PARALLEL PARKED BEFORE,

304
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,736
SO I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THE [bleep] I'M DOING.

305
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:11,338
OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

306
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,306
- ALL RIGHT BRING IT BACK.
CRANK YOUR WHEEL.

307
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:14,641
YEAH, CUT IT.

308
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,810
I HAVE TO TEACH NICOLE RIGHT NOW
HOW TO PARALLEL PARK.

309
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:18,545
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE'S
GONNA LAST IN THIS CITY

310
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,880
WITH THIS MONSTER TRUCK.

311
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,215
DO NOT TOUCH THE WHEEL.
- OH, DON'T TOUCH IT?

312
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,117
- NO, LIKE, KEEP IT--
ALL RIGHT, STOP.

313
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,586
STOP! STOP,
STOP, STOP, STOP.

314
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:29,757
OKAY, GO STRAIGHT.
BUT CRANK IT ALL THE WAY.

315
00:11:29,757 --> 00:11:30,991
STOP.

316
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:34,762
- I'M SECOND-GUESSING
MY TRUCK DECISION NOW.

317
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,197
ALL RIGHT, I'M CURVING IT.
- STOP...STOP!

318
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,832
OH, MY GOD!
OKAY.

319
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:41,802
- IF I KNEW I WAS MOVING
TO THE CITY BEFORE,

320
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:43,403
I WOULD'VE NEVER
GOT THE TRUCK.

321
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,205
SO...I'M SCREWED.

322
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:46,974
- I HAVE TO RUN.
- WHY?

323
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,641
- I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

324
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,110
- YOU'RE GONNA GO OUT
IN THE WILDERNESS?

325
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,379
- I HAVE TO PEE.
I CAN'T HOLD IT AT THIS POINT.

326
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,048
HOMEBOY IS NOT MAKING A GOOD
FIRST IMPRESSION RIGHT NOW.

327
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,049
NOT AT ALL.

328
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,118
- JUST PEE OUT HERE.

329
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,953
- DO I CHANGE
A TAMPON DOWN THERE?

330
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,790
[laughter]
THERE'S AN ISSUE.

331
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,224
- CAN'T YOU WAIT,
LIKE, FIVE MINUTES?

332
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,492
- I'VE WAITED 30--
- IS THIS VICTOR?

333
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,027
VICTOR?
- YES.

334
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:09,362
- DUDE, WHAT THE [bleep]?
- I'M SORRY.

335
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,798
I WAS TRYING TO FIND
A PARKING SPOT,

336
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,632
AND I WAS ON MY WAY HERE.
- IT'S ALL GOOD.

337
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,367
- I JUST HAVE TO USE
THE BATHROOM.

338
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,036
- OKAY, COME ON IN.

339
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:19,973
- NICE SUIT.
- THANK YOU.

340
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,809
- VICTOR THE REALTOR
IS CUTE,

341
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:24,411
BUT HIS BLAZER
MAKES MY EYEBALLS BLEED.

342
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,280
WHAT VINTAGE SHOP FROM THE 80s
DID YOU PICK THAT UP AT?

343
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,082
- COME ON IN. YOU CAN USE
THE BATHROOM, I GUESS,

344
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,350
BEFORE I DO
THE SHOWING.

345
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,020
- OKAY. YOU START LOOKING.
- OKAY.

346
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,188
- THIS IS THE FRONT BEDROOM
ON THE STREET,

347
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,324
AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE.
- YO, THERE'S NO TOILET PAPER!

348
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,026
- DO YOU HAVE
TOILET PAPER FOR HER?

349
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,127
- UM...

350
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,829
THERE MIGHT BE
TOILET PAPER UPSTAIRS.

351
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:42,963
IF YOU LIKE, I CAN GO
TAKE A LOOK FOR YOU.

352
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,999
- OH, MY GOD.

353
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:49,402
- SHE HAS HER PERIOD.

354
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:53,941
- OH, BOO,
YOUR BAGEL BAG!

355
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:55,308
YOUR BAGEL BAG
HAS PAPER!

356
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,978
- CAN YOU NOT WIPE YOUR VAGINA
WITH MY BAGEL?

357
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,112
- THANK GOD I BOUGHT YOU
THAT BAGEL.

358
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,247
- WHAT IF THE TOILET
WASN'T WORKING

359
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,849
BECAUSE NO ONE
LIVES THERE?

360
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,750
- WELL, MY TAMPON WOULD
BE HANGING OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.

361
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,652
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.

362
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,955
- YOU'VE DONE WORSE.
- YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

363
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,689
- THIS IS A GOOD AREA?
- YES.

364
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,358
THIS IS WHERE--
A LOT OF FAMILIES

365
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,860
AND COUPLES HAVE BEEN
MOVING HERE.

366
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,694
- I DON'T WANT TO LIVE NEXT
TO FAMILIES AND COUPLES...

367
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:16,029
- BUT YOU WANT IT
TO BE SAFE.

368
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,898
- WHAT PART OF JERSEY CITY
DO YOU LIVE IN?

369
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:20,400
- UM, I LIVE
IN THE GREENVILLE SECTION.

370
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,935
- I WANT TO GO
TO THE GREENVILLE SECTION.

371
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,206
- I'M ELENA.
- THIS IS ELENA, GUYS.

372
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:29,042
- HI, NICOLE.
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

373
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,777
- IS THIS PARKING
BACK HERE?

374
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,980
- IT'S NOT FOR THIS BUILDING.
- SO YOU HAVE TO PARALLEL.

375
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,947
- YOU HAVE TO PARK
IN THE STREET.

376
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,648
- SO PRETTY.

377
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,484
MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE I'M HOME IN SEASIDE.

378
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,086
MOVE ON.
- NEXT ONE.

379
00:13:39,086 --> 00:13:40,153
THIS REMINDS ME OF,
LIKE, MY MOM'S HOUSE.

380
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,521
- AAH!
- AAH!

381
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,057
OH, MY GOD. COOL!
- THERE'S A ROACH IN THERE.

382
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,692
- MOVING ON.
- MOVING ON.

383
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,760
- AS I MENTIONED,
THIS HAS ALL BEEN RENOVATED.

384
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,997
IT'S A RAILROAD-STYLE
APARTMENT.

385
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:53,133
BASICALLY MEANS YOU HAVE TO
WALK THROUGH ONE BEDROOM

386
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,301
TO GET TO THE NEXT.

387
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:57,037
- I THOUGHT IT WAS BUILT
IN THE RAILROAD AGES

388
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:59,606
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING OF PEOPLE
BUILDING RAILROADS, SO...

389
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,108
HOW OLD
IS THIS BUILDING?

390
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,976
- PROBABLY BUILT
IN THE EARLY 1900s.

391
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:05,012
- OH, [bleep] THAT.

392
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,080
AAH!

393
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,616
THERE COULD'VE BEEN MURDERS
HERE YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT,

394
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:13,353
HOMICIDES...THAT'S, LIKE,
THE SAME THING, RIGHT?

395
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,256
DOES IT ECHO IN HERE?
HELLO!

396
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:17,657
YEAH, SO I CAN
HEAR YOU HAVE SEX.

397
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:21,161
- THE--I COULD--NO.
THIS IS--IT'S--NO.

398
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,129
DO YOU GUYS [bleep]?

399
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:26,699
- NO.
- YOU REALLY DON'T?

400
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,536
- NO.
- AWW.

401
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:32,205
- ANYWAY, SO...
- JUST TRYING TO BREAK THE ICE.

402
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,540
JUST TRYING TO BREAK
THE ICE.

403
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,842
VICTOR AND ELENA CLAIM
THAT THEY DON'T HAVE SEX.

404
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:36,977
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

405
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,311
- THEY'RE TWO
GOOD LOOKING PEOPLE

406
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,579
AND THEY'RE IN
THE SAME BUSINESS,

407
00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:42,115
AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE
MIX BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE.

408
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:44,817
- THAT'S WHY ROGER WORKS
WITH TRUCK DRIVERS.

409
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,286
- 'CAUSE HE [bleep] THEM?
- NO.

410
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:49,122
SO HE DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK
AT HOT GIRLS ALL DAY, [bleep].

411
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:50,723
- [chuckling]

412
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,292
MOVING ON.
- MOVING ON.

413
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,666
- EW! OH, MY GOD,
HE LOOKS LIKE A PEDOPHILE.

414
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:03,270
EW.
both: EW!

415
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,438
- WHY ARE YOU
SO CREEPY?

416
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,873
- OH, GOD, JENNI,
OH, MY GOD.

417
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,275
- [laughing]

418
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,143
- EW, EW, EW,
EW, EW.

419
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,811
HE'S SCARY.

420
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,117
both: AAH!
- GOOD-BYE.

421
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:20,020
- SO FAR, HOUSE HUNTING
IS KIND OF A LITTLE STRESSFUL

422
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,323
BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVEN'T
FOUND ANYTHING PERFECT YET.

423
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,992
SO IT'S, LIKE,
ARE WE GOING TO?

424
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,693
- OH.

425
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,529
IS THIS IT?

426
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:30,998
- IS THIS A GARAGE?

427
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:34,001
I'M THINKING THIS IS EITHER,
LIKE, AN OLD WAREHOUSE,

428
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,335
OR A FRICKIN' FIREHOUSE.

429
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,104
EITHER ONE, I MEAN,
THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

430
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,871
LIKE, WHO LIVES
IN A FIREHOUSE?

431
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,207
- OH, MY GOD.

432
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,541
- I'M NOT LIKING
THESE [bleep] STAIRS.

433
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:43,276
THIS REMINDS ME
OF [bleep] ITALY.

434
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,245
I DON'T FEEL LIKE WALKING
UP THESE STAIRS ALL THE TIME.

435
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:48,448
HOLY [bleep].

436
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,884
THIS IS HUGE!
- I DIDN'T EXPECT THIS.

437
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,653
- WELL, YOU GUYS WANT TO START
FROM THE BEDROOMS FIRST?

438
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,689
- SURE.
- WORK YOUR WAYS BACK.

439
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:00,193
- IT'S GOT BIG BED.
IT'S A NORMAL BED.

440
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,529
[laughing] DO WE GET
TO KEEP THE BED?

441
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,097
- OH, IT SMELLS
LIKE GRANDMA'S.

442
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,632
- THERE'S TWO LEVELS
LIKE A LOFT.

443
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,800
PUT 'EM UPSTAIRS.

444
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,769
- JUST LIKE HER STAIRS?
- YEAH.

445
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,604
- OH, MY GOD,
I'M LOVING THIS.

446
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:13,806
- THIS BETTER [bleep]
TAKE DOGS.

447
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,076
- I MADE SURE OF IT.
THEY DEFINITELY TAKE DOGS HERE.

448
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,910
SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
OF THE OPEN FEELING, THOUGH?

449
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:21,048
- I HONESTLY DON'T THINK
ANYTHING COMPARES TO THIS

450
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,349
BECAUSE IT'S JUST
SO BIG.

451
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,816
- I LOVE THIS PLACE.
WE'RE JUST--

452
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,318
- THIS IS DEFINITELY
A BACHELORETTE PAD.

453
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,586
- SO DO YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE SO YOU GUYS

454
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,321
CAN DISCUSS IT AND THEN SEE
WHAT YOU GUYS THINK?

455
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,756
- SURE.

456
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,059
IT'S A LITTLE PRESSURE
JUST BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT

457
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:33,893
TO FIND A HOUSE TODAY.

458
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,928
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE
WE NEED TO DO THIS NOW,

459
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:36,929
MAKE A DECISION.

460
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,132
SO?

461
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:41,501
- THIS, TO ME, IS FIVE-STAR.

462
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,136
- THIS IS DEFINITELY
FIVE-STAR.

463
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,937
- YEAH, I LOVE
THE OPENNESS.

464
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:48,275
LIKE, OUR BEDROOMS ARE
IDENTICAL, AND IT'S SO CUTE.

465
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,776
- I'M KIND OF GLAD
IT'S EQUAL.

466
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:53,446
AND I'M THE CHIEF,
AND YOU'RE THE CAPTAIN.

467
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:55,782
WE WANT THIS PLACE.
- I'M READY.

468
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,750
YOU?

469
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,652
- WELL, UM...

470
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,522
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU

471
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,358
THAT, UM, I REALLY WANTED
TO TELL YOU FOR, LIKE, A WHILE,

472
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,160
BUT I JUST WANTED TO WAIT.

473
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,462
- I DON'T LIKE THAT,
'CAUSE ANYTHING COULD COME OUT

474
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,298
OF THAT GIRL'S MOUTH.
ANYTHING.

475
00:17:11,298 --> 00:17:14,901
YEAH?
- UM...

476
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,903
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT
TELLING JENNI MY SECRET

477
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:19,106
JUST BECAUSE I JUST
DON'T WANT HER TO BE UPSET

478
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,740
AND BE, LIKE,
"WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?"

479
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,277
SO BEFORE WE GET ALL SERIOUS
AND SIGN THE LEASE

480
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,712
AND ALL THIS STUFF,

481
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,347
I REALLY NEED
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

482
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,649
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

483
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,918
UM...

484
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:36,189
SO JIONNI PROPOSED,
AND I'M ENGAGED.

485
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,724
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

486
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,259
- YEAH, I AM.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

487
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,693
- I SWEAR.

488
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,829
LIKE, I'M ENGAGED.
- YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME.

489
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,267
- THERE'S MORE
SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW ON THE WAY,

490
00:17:47,267 --> 00:17:51,638
AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

491
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,540
UM...

492
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:57,644
SO JIONNI PROPOSED,
AND I'M ENGAGED.

493
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,179
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

494
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:00,713
- YEAH, I AM.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

495
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,215
- I SWEAR.

496
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,384
LIKE, I'M ENGAGED.
- YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME.

497
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,586
- I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU
BECAUSE THEN I DIDN'T WANT YOU

498
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,688
TO NOT WANT
TO MOVE IN WITH ME.

499
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,157
- YOU WAITED?

500
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:13,826
- YEAH, BECAUSE I-I WANT THIS
MOMENT TO DEFINITELY HAPPEN.

501
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:15,628
- I FEEL LIKE I'M IN
THE TWILIGHT ZONE RIGHT NOW,

502
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:19,466
BECAUSE I HONESTLY THOUGHT
THAT I WOULD BE THE ONE ENGAGED

503
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:23,069
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE.

504
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:27,307
THAT'S NOT REAL.
- OKAY.

505
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,409
YEAH, SO...
- IT'S BIG.

506
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,743
- IT'S HUGE.

507
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:33,580
- I AM, LIKE, DUMBFOUNDED.
I...PFFT.

508
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,283
SO WHAT THE [bleep]--UH, NO,
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

509
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,685
HOLD ON, NO, NO, NO.
- THANK YOU.

510
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,787
- WHAT THE [bleep]
DOES HE SAY ABOUT THIS?

511
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,590
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE NOT
GONNA GET MARRIED, LIKE, SOON.

512
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,857
WE'RE GONNA WAIT,
YOU KNOW?

513
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,659
WE'RE GONNA BE ENGAGED
FOR A COUPLE YEARS.

514
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,561
- I GOT THE CHILLS,
AND I'M, LIKE, REALLY EXCITED,

515
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,029
BUT I'M LIKE, OH, MY GOD,
WE'RE TRYING

516
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,631
TO GET AN APARTMENT, BUT YOU'RE
ENGAGED TO SOMEONE, LIKE...

517
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,600
SO MANY EMOTIONS
ARE GOING AROUND

518
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,834
THAT I'M, LIKE, SPEECHLESS.

519
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:55,968
YOU'RE SURE YOU WANT
TO DO THIS?

520
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,437
BE ENGAGED?

521
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,339
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BE
THE FIRST ONE GETTING ENGAGED.

522
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,974
- YEAH, WELL, HE ASKED.
- HE JUST WANTED TO?

523
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,544
- HE KIND OF HAD A REASON.

524
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:07,447
UM, AND IT'S DEFINITELY
GONNA CHANGE YOUR LIFE

525
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:09,482
ALONG WITH MINE.
- HUH?

526
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,551
- SO HE PRETTY MUCH ASKED ME
TO GET MARRIED--

527
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,421
AND ALSO BECAUSE HE, YOU KNOW,
WE WANT TO GET MARRIED--

528
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,456
IS BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

529
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,965
- WHAT DO I SAY?

530
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,967
- I'M PREGNANT.

531
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,869
AND ENGAGED.

532
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,804
INSTEAD OF LIFE THROWING ME
A CURVEBALL,

533
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:34,040
IT THREW ME A SPERM BALL.

534
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,709
OBVIOUSLY.

535
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:44,083
SO LET'S GO SIGN
THIS LEASE.

536
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,422
- AAH! [bleep]!
OKAY, I'M GOOD.

537
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,823
I AM MOVING IN...

538
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:51,858
WE'LL SURVIVE THIS.

539
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,361
WITH A PREGNANT,
ENGAGED SNOOKI.

540
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,996
IT'S MOVING!
- OH, I GOTTA THROW UP.

541
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:59,399
HONESTLY, I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW
THAT I COULD MAKE A BABY.

542
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,502
SO THE FACT THAT I CAN
REPRODUCE IS VERY SCARY.

543
00:20:02,502 --> 00:20:04,371
- I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.
- WHAT'S THE OVER-UNDER

544
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,438
ON HIM BEING
FIVE-FOOT?

545
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,073
[laughter]

546
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,541
- NICOLE!

547
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,877
- ME AND JENNI, OBVIOUSLY
WE'RE GONNA CLASH A LITTLE BIT.

548
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,245
STOP SCREAMING AT ME.

549
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,546
YOU BE CONSIDERATE.

550
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,282
I'M PREGNANT
AND WE'RE ALL...WHOO!

551
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,049
- THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
ME AND NICOLE'S LAST HURRAH,

552
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,851
AND SHE'S NOT HURRAH-ING.

553
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,588
- I DON'T THINK I WANT
TO LIVE WITH JENNI ANYMORE.

554
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:24,591
- THE ONLY THING YOU'RE
WINNING AT, ROGER, IS LOSING ME.

555
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:26,326
IF THIS IS GONNA BE
WHAT WE HAVE,

556
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:27,660
I NEED SOMETHING ELSE.

557
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,429
[sobbing]
- CAN I HUG YOU?

558
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:31,898
ME AND JENNI BICKER
LIKE WE'RE [bleep] SISTERS,

559
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,199
BUT, LIKE,
I WOULD DIE FOR YOU.

560
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,834
- YEAH, 100%, I WOULD TAKE
A BULLET FOR YOU.

561
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,636
- MM-HMM. BUT LET'S MAKE SURE
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

562
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:37,904
- YEAH.

563
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:41,441
OH, MY GOD! WHAT DID YOU DO
TO [bleep] BARNEY?

564
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,809
both: AWW!

565
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:43,943
- DID IT [bleep] ON ME?

566
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,512
- HEY!
- OH!

567
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:46,579
- [laughing]
- I THINK RIGHT NOW

568
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,915
IS THE PRIME TIME FOR US
TO BE TOGETHER,

569
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,451
YOU KNOW, TO JUST ENJOY LIFE
AS BEST FRIENDS.

570
00:20:51,451 --> 00:20:54,153
both: MWAH!

571
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:57,156
- * HERE WE GO AGAIN *
