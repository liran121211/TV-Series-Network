1
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:05,339
- I'M SORRY.
- WHY'RE YOU ALL DRESSED UP?

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,242
- 'CAUSE IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

3
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:10,978
SORRY.

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:13,714
- WHAT THE--

5
00:00:13,714 --> 00:00:16,784
IT'S NOT FUNNY.
I'M TRYING TO BE MAD AT YOU.

6
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:19,287
ROGER MAKES ME LAUGH,
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE HIM.

7
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:21,689
BUT HE DRIVES ME
[bleep] NUTS.

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,258
- * I DON'T CARE *

9
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:25,826
* I LOVE IT *

10
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,761
* I DON'T CARE *

11
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,363
* I LOVE IT
I LOVE IT *

12
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,765
* I DON'T CARE *

13
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,635
* I LOVE IT *

14
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,470
* I DON'T CARE *

15
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,540
[mellow guitar music]

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,110
* *

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:45,079
- * WHEN WILL THE SPRING
COME AGAIN *

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,184
* WHEN WILL FLOWERS PUSH UP
AND BLOW IN THE WIND *

19
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:53,487
* WHEN WILL THE SPRING
COME AGAIN *

20
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,022
- NOTHING WAS REALLY
SOLVED LAST NIGHT,

21
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:57,625
BUT ME AND ROGER
WOKE UP AMICABLY.

22
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:01,229
WE WOKE UP COOL IN A SENSE
THAT WE WEREN'T ARGUING.

23
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,496
WANNA GO OUT?
- WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

24
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:05,133
YOU WANNA GO TO BREAKFAST?
- BROWNSTONE?

25
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:06,934
I AM TELLING ROGER
WE SHOULD GO OUT TO BREAKFAST

26
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:10,338
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO TALK
TO HIM ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

27
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:12,640
- NICOLE, THEY WANNA
GO OUT FOR BREAKFAST.

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,709
- I CAN'T, I HAVE TO GO
TO FRIGGIN' KINDERGARTEN.

29
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:21,515
- * WHEN WILL THE SPRING
COME AGAIN *

30
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:25,219
[kiss]
- I GOTTA LEAVE.

31
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,954
- BREAKFAST,
THE HAMILTON INN?

32
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:30,424
- KINDA HARD TO TALK IN THERE,
BUT, YEAH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

33
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:34,195
IF YOU COULDN'T TALK,
IT WOULD BE A BETTER BREAKFAST.

34
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:35,729
- I'LL KILL YOU.

35
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,632
- THE FOOD WOULD TASTE BETTER.
I'M JUST SAYING.

36
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:40,401
- YOU LEAVING?
- NO, I'M JUST PACKING.

37
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,935
NICOLE'S GOTTA GO
DO HER THING.

38
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,937
- YOU CAN COME OUT
TO LUNCH WITH US.

39
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,540
- WITH YOU AND ROGER?
- BREAKFAST. WHATEVER.

40
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,076
- I'D BE
YOUR [bleep] THERAPIST.

41
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:52,580
- BYE.

42
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:01,989
- HEY.
- WE'RE DYEING THE GIRLS TODAY.

43
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:05,759
SO I WANNA TEST THIS ORGANIC,
HEALTHY DYE

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,196
THAT I'M REALLY EXCITED
TO PUT ON MY DOGS,

45
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:09,997
SO THAT'S WHAT NICOLE'S
GONNA DO TODAY

46
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:11,599
WHILE SHE'S VOLUNTEERING.

47
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,302
SAY HI! ARE YOU EXCITED?
- COME HERE.

48
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,304
- ALL PINK. I THINK
WE SHOULD DO IT ALL PINK.

49
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:18,672
LIKE A PINK FLUFF BALL.

50
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,210
- NOT REALLY.
WE GOTTA TEST IT OUT.

51
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,745
I'M THINKING LIKE NOELLE'S
TAIL AND CLAWS.

52
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,580
- THAT'S NOT FUN.

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,416
- I LOVE YOU.
I'LL BE BACK.

54
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,917
- SO YOU WANNA START
WITH THE FUN STUFF?

55
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,219
YOU WANNA START DYEING?

56
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:32,853
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

57
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,055
- I DEFINITELY WANNA DYE
BELLA PINK.

58
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,358
AND THEN NOELLE
COULD BE LIKE A PURPLE,

59
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:41,762
BECAUSE NOELLE IS KIND OF LIKE
A TOMBOY/LESBIAN.

60
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:44,232
- AH--
- OOH--

61
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:45,666
- WHAT DID YOU DO, NICOLE?

62
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,435
- I DIDN'T DO IT.
CAN YOU GET IT OFF?

63
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,570
- [laughing]

64
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,805
- YOU WANNA JUST DYE HER
ALL PURPLE?

65
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,242
- SHOULD WE?
- YEAH.

66
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:56,877
- WILL JENNI BE MAD?
- NO.

67
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:59,146
SO I DECIDED,
SINCE I'M THE AUNT,

68
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,249
THAT WE SHOULD JUST DYE NOELLE
ALL PURPLE

69
00:03:01,249 --> 00:03:04,352
BECAUSE...YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT WOULD BE CUTE.

70
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:07,087
YOU'RE GONNA BE PURPLE!

71
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,760
- I HAD A [bleep] WEEKEND.

72
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,864
- BY [bleep] DO YOU MEAN
OVERDRAMATIC AND SELFISH?

73
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,166
- I'VE BEEN OVERDRAMATIC
SINCE I WAS A KID.

74
00:03:19,166 --> 00:03:21,101
- I KNOW YOU HATE
THE WORD "INSECURE,"

75
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,004
SO I WON'T USE IT 'CAUSE
I DON'T WANT TO BE INSULTING,

76
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:29,109
BUT YOU ARE VERY,
VERY SUSPICIOUS OF ME.

77
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,579
I'M JUST SAYING TRUST ME.
I DESERVE IT.

78
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:34,648
I'VE EARNED IT.
IT PISSES ME OFF WHEN YOU DON'T.

79
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,116
- YEAH.

80
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:38,051
WE DO HAVE A LOT
TO WORK ON.

81
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,820
- WITHOUT A DOUBT.
THAT'S WHY I DON'T THINK

82
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,090
WE'RE READY TO GET MARRIED
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

83
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,926
I DO WANT TO MARRY YOU ONE DAY,
BUT WE'RE NOT READY.

84
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,728
- I AGREE.

85
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,930
- I REMEMBER THE FIRST DAY
YOU WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR.

86
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,964
I SAID TO MY BUDDY,
"OH, MY GOD,

87
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,433
THAT IS MY TYPE OF GIRL."

88
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,168
- SO IF YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME THEN...

89
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,170
- OH, I WOULD HAVE NEVER
[bleep] DATED YOU.

90
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,872
YOU'RE A MESS.
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

91
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:01,041
- "I WOULD'VE NEVER DATED YOU."
- IT'S TOO LATE, I FELL IN LOVE.

92
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,311
I GOTTA STICK IT OUT NOW.

93
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,646
THESE WARS, THESE BATTLES,
IF YOU WILL, THAT WE HAVE--

94
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,915
THEY KIND OF HELP US OUT,
AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE

95
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,318
THAT YOU HAVE TO SCREAM
AND YELL TO DO IT, BUT...

96
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,220
YOU KNOW,
IT'S OUR WAY, I GUESS.

97
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,589
- I THINK LATER TONIGHT
I'M GONNA LOOK ONLINE

98
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,691
FOR A FAKE BABY.
- A FAKE BABY?

99
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,926
OH, ONE OF THOSE

100
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,061
LIKE ONES THAT ACTUALLY
USES THE BATHROOM--

101
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,897
- OH, NOT LIKE A TOYS "R" US
ONE, LIKE A LEGIT...

102
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,033
- AS A GAG GIFT OR AS--
- NO, I'M GONNA LEGIT SAY,

103
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,835
LIKE, "THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA BE DEALING WITH

104
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:30,404
IN ABOUT 5 1/2 MONTHS."
- NEED A CRIB.

105
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,739
A BABY DOESN'T ACTUALLY SLEEP--

106
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,140
AN INFANT DOESN'T SLEEP
IN THE BED WITH YOU.

107
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,008
- PUT LIKE A LITTLE BASSINET
NEXT TO THE BED.

108
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,344
- OKAY. NICOLE'S
GONNA HAVE NO IDEA

109
00:04:36,344 --> 00:04:37,745
WHAT THE WORD "BASSINET" MEANS.

110
00:04:37,745 --> 00:04:39,012
- GOD.
- GONNA HAVE TO EXPLAIN

111
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,748
THAT ONE TO HER.
- IT LEGIT IS 16 AND PREGNANT.

112
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,416
I SWEAR TO GOD.

113
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,956
THANK YOU FOR COMING

114
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:50,858
AND TEMPORARILY FIXING US.

115
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,193
- [chuckles] LOVE YOU,
HATE YOU AT THE SAME TIME.

116
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,463
- I DON'T LIKE YOU,
BUT I LOVE YOU.

117
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,465
- MOSTLY HATE.
A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE IN THERE.

118
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,833
BYE, PSYCHO.
- BYE, [bleep].

119
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:08,576
FAKE BABY TIME.

120
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:14,482
SO I WAS THINKING ABOUT
GETTING NICOLE A FAKE BABY,

121
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:17,284
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE SHE SHOULD
PREP FOR MOTHERHOOD.

122
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,952
BUT LET'S GET REAL.
IT'S A FAKE BABY.

123
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,120
EEW!

124
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,490
THAT'S A LITTLE
TOO LIFELIKE!

125
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,861
"REALCARE BABY
MAKES IT POSSIBLE

126
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,730

129
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,569
OH, YEAH.

00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,440
I'D LIKE A TAN ONE.

I'D HEARD THESE ARE LIKE
THE BEST THINGS

133
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:44,111
FOR PRACTICING PARENTHOOD
OR ABSTINENCE.

134
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,814
IT'S A LITTLE TOO LATE
FOR THAT.

135
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:49,717
- HELLO?
- HI. MY NAME IS JENNI,

136
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:52,986
AND I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS
THAT I SAW OFF YOUR WEBSITE

137
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,322
ABOUT GETTING A FAKE BABY.

138
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,557
- OH, YEAH, OF COURSE.
GO AHEAD.

139
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,459
- ARE THEY PRETTY ACCURATE
TO THE REAL THING?

140
00:05:58,459 --> 00:05:59,660
- HELLO?

141
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,295
- [mouthing word]
- UM, THEY ARE...

142
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,197
- CAN I CALL YOU BACK
IN TEN MINUTES?

143
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,599
HI, BOO.
- HELLO.

144
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,768
- CAN YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM
FOR A SECOND?

145
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:10,203
- WHY?
- HELLO, ARE YOU STILL THERE?

146
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,304
- JUST DO IT.
IT'S A SURPRISE.

147
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:12,440
YEAH, CAN YOU HOLD ON
ONE SECOND?

148
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,841
- YOU'RE SURPRISING ME?
- OKAY.

149
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,576
- YEAH. JUST GO OUTSIDE
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

150
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,910
- YOU NEVER KNOW WITH JENNI.

151
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,479
WHEN SHE SAYS
SHE HAS A SURPRISE,

152
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,448
IT'S EITHER REALLY GOOD
OR IT'S A [bleep] JOKE.

153
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:22,315
- WHAT COLORS DO YOU HAVE?

154
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,251
- COLORS?
- YEAH.

155
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,819
I NEED TAN.
- TAN?

156
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,056
UM...WE DON'T HAVE TAN.

157
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,891
- SOME SORT OF OFF-WHITE?

158
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,527
- UM...
- SOME SORT OF SPANISH?

159
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:36,063
- LIKE BEIGE...IT'S KIND OF--
IT'S KIND OF AN OFF--

160
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,366
IT'S--IT'S JUST SO VEINY.
I--WELL--

161
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,535
- A CAUCASIAN, YOU MEAN?

162
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,672
- YOU COULD PROBABLY PAINT
YOUR BABY IF YOU WANTED.

163
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,974
- CAN I COME OUT?
- NO.

164
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:49,943
- SO TODAY IS MY APPOINTMENT,
AND I'M GONNA ASK THE DOCTOR

165
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,479
IF HE CAN TELL THE SEX.

166
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,913
- THAT'S THE BABY'S HEAD
RIGHT THERE.

167
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,347
- CAN WE SEE
IF IT HAS A WEINER?

168
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,616
- THIS IS LIKE
THE REAL DEAL.

169
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:57,585
LIKE, I AM HAVING
A BABY [bleep].

170
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,753

TO PAINT THE SPARE ROOM.

171
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,495

I MIGHT AS WELL JUST TAKE TWO.

174
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,100
- TWO COME IN THE DELUXE
PACKAGE.

175
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,268

I'LL TAKE THE DELUXE PACKAGE.

176
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,170

00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,541

180
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:25,312
IT AIN'T FOR ME, SO...

181
00:07:25,312 --> 00:07:27,548
BYE.

182
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:29,917
- WHY ARE YOU BEING
A SHADESTER?

183
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:32,119
I HOPE IT'S NOT
A MEAN THING.

184
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,121
- WOULD I EVER DO
MEAN TO YOU?

185
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,290
- YEAH.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

186
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,129
WE MIGHT AS WELL
GRAB THE DOGS.

187
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,832
- CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
WHAT BELLA LOOKS LIKE.

188
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,734
HOW'S THE BITCHES LOOK?

00:07:46,734 --> 00:07:48,335
SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

190
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,571
THAT JENNI'S GONNA SEE
NOELLE AND BELLA DYED.

191
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,340
I'M KINDA LIKE DYING INSIDE,
'CAUSE I REALLY WANNA LAUGH.

192
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,976
BUT I'M KINDA SCARED, YOU KNOW,
JENNI MIGHT PUNCH ME IN THE FACE

193
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,579
IF SHE SEES
WHAT I DID TO NOELLE.

194
00:07:58,579 --> 00:07:59,713
- STOP WITH THE ANTICIPATION.

195
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,414
AAH!

196
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,216
[Nicole laughs]
OH, MY GOD!

197
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:04,785
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HER?

198
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,254
[Nicole laughing]

199
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:12,025
- SHE HAD A LOT OF FUN.

200
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:14,695

OH, MY GOD.

208
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,781
- I DO NOT CALL MY DOGS
ACCESSORIES.

209
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:35,115
- SORRY.
- THEY'RE MY CHILDREN.

210
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,184
- OH. WHOOPS.

211
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,919
EVEN IF YOU'RE MAD AT ME,
I SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

212
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,954
THIS IS GETTING BACK AT HER

213
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,290
FOR SLAPPING ME IN THE FACE
WITH PIZZA DOUGH.

214
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,826

SHE GOT ME SOMETHING

233
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:32,072
WHAT A SWEET FRIEND.

234
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,111
IS THIS A [bleep] BABY?

235
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,114
- GOOD LUCK.
[laughs]

236
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,119
- WHY'D YOU GET TWO BABIES?
I'M NOT HAVING TWINS.

237
00:09:46,119 --> 00:09:49,222
- I SAID [bleep] IT.
I MIGHT AS WELL GET MYSELF ONE.

238
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,924
- EEW! IT HAS A WEINER!

239
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,726
- THAT'S WHAT MALE BABIES HAVE.

240
00:09:52,726 --> 00:09:55,428
- DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE
A GUIDO.

241
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,197
- I ASKED FOR TAN.
THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT.

242
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,668
- WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

243
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,137
ARE YOU ALIVE?

244
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,442
JENNI.
- WHAT?

245
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,344
- IT'S BREATHING
LIKE AN ALIEN.

246
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,946
IT'S BREATHING,
BUT REALLY WEIRD.

247
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,314

00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,254
- JUST BREATHING.

251
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,923
- I MADE A BASSINET
FOR MINE.

252
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,692
- DUDE, MY BABY'S BORING.

253
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,026
THIS IS NOT A BABY

254
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,928
THAT I FEEL LIKE
I WOULD GIVE BIRTH TO.

255
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:30,397
- THESE BABIES ARE LIKE...

256
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,699
- CREEPY.
- THEY'RE CREEPY,

257
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,533
'CAUSE THEY JUST HAVE
NO FACIAL EXPRESSIONS.

258
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,369
THEY LOOK AT YOU LIKE
A LITTLE HAUNTED DOLL

259
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,738
FROM LIKE A HORROR MOVIE.

260
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:39,773

'CAUSE YOURS WOKE MINE UP.

271
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,901
- MAYBE YOU'RE HUNGRY.

272
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:11,271
WANT SOME BREAST MILK?
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

273

[both dolls crying]

274
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:16,476
[Jenni murmuring]

275
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:19,813
- WHEN THE BABY STARTS CRYING,
YOU HAVE LESS THAN TWO MINUTES

276
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,414
TO FIGURE OUT
THE FOUR POSSIBILITIES

277
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,750
OF WHY IT'S CRYING--

278
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,584
WHETHER IT NEEDS TO BE
BURPED, ROCKED,

279
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:27,087
FED, OR DIAPER CHANGE.

280
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,322
[crying dies down]
- IT WAS A DIAPER!

281
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:32,760
[loud crying resumes]
OH, MAYBE NOT.

00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,165
[dolls continue bawling]

283
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:41,268
I HAVE A DRAMA QUEEN.

284
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,375
IT'S NOT EVEN REAL.

285
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,778
I THINK THESE BABIES ARE HARDER
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

286
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,145
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM.

287
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:55,482
[crying continues]
THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH A HANDFUL.

288
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,917
- EVERY TIME IT CRIES,

289
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,585
MY ADRENALINE
IS GOING HIGHER AND HIGHER.

290
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:01,354
- AND THE BABY'S REALLY HEAVY,
AND MY ARMS ARE LIKE KILLING ME.

291
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:04,958

[dolls resume crying]
- OH, MY GOD.

295
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,403
[Snooki laughs]
OH! OH, NO!

296
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,641
- WAIT A MINUTE.

297
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:24,044
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS THING
TO THE GAY BAR TONIGHT?

298
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,612

344
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,065
BUT YOU KNOW, THIS REAL BABY,

345
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,366
IT'S EITHER
YOU LEAVE IT AT HOME

346
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:54,667
AND GIVE IT NEGLECT,

347
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,736
OR YOU TAKE IT TO THE BAR
AND YOU TAKE CARE OF IT.

348
00:13:56,736 --> 00:14:00,908
- I'M GONNA BREAST FEED.
- HA HA!

349
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,775

352
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,016

- I JUST HAD A JOEY SANDWICH.

356
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:19,126
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER

357
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,760
WITH YOUR GAY BEST FRIENDS
AT A GAY BAR

358
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,529
WITH TWO FAKE BABIES.

359
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,031
- WHERE'D YOU PUT
THE OTHER DIAPER?

360
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,066
- I'M OUT OF DIAPERS.

361
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,435
- WE ONLY HAD ONE DIAPER.
I BROUGHT IT WITH HIM.

362
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,503
- NO, I BROUGHT TWO.
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH IT?

363
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:33,740
- CHECK IN HIS PANTS.
- WHERE'S THE STROLLER?

364
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,144
- OVER HERE.
- CHECK THE RED DOLL STROLLER.

365
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:38,946
THE DIAPER'S MISSING.

366
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:39,980
LOOK, I DID NOT LOSE
THIS [bleep].

367
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,748

- WE'RE MISSING
A [bleep] DIAPER.

374
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,794
'CAUSE EVERYONE'S SMASHED.

375
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:55,963
- LET'S GO.

376
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:57,097

GET MY BABY HOME,

377
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,465
AND I WANNA GO TO SLEEP

378
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:01,969
BECAUSE I'M SO EXHAUSTED
FROM TAKING CARE OF LORENZO.

00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:28,295
IN THE CREASE
IS HIS THROW UP.

387
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,363
YOU DID THROW UP!

388
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,698
JOEY, YOU THREW UP IN THE COUCH.

390
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,335
AND NOW I WANNA THROW UP
BECAUSE OF IT.

391
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,703
- I DIDN'T THROW UP.

392
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,272
- HE NEEDS TO GET IT ALL OUT.
- NO!

393
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,873

394
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,276

00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:19,279
HE WANTS A BOTTLE.

404
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,647

418
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,190

00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:53,640
I WANT IT TO WAKE UP AND CRY

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,743
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
- IT'S NOT WORKING.

456
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:32,612
- TRIGGER IT
ON THE BACK OF THE NECK.

457
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,214
- TRIGGER WHAT?
- THE THING IN YOUR HAND.

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,895
IT'S LIKE A BUZZ KILL.

465
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,863

466
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,632
NOT THIS FRICKIN' THING.

467

00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:16,523
THE LEGS ARE KINDA FLEXED

00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,991
THAT'S THE BABY'S HEAD

00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,234
- NO, I'M FINE.

483
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,701
- I WAS WATCHING
MOM'S EXPRESSION.

484
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:31,003
'CAUSE SHE WAS GONNA CRY,
I WAS ABOUT TO CRY.

485
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,739

00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,151
ALL RIGHT?

491
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,153
- A BOY!

492
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,421
IT'S A BOY.
- I KNEW IT.

493
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,457
AND I KNEW--
- JENNI CALLED IT.

494
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,958
- I KNEW THE DOCTOR
WAS GONNA SAY A BOY

495
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,426
BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE
THE PEE-PEE.

496
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,862
- THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE.

497
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,564
- YEAH. I THINK SO.

498
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,834
- JIONNI GAVE HIM
A PRETTY DECENT PENIS.

499
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,936
- EEW! THAT'S MY SON!

500
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:05,738
- I CAN SAY YOUR SON
HAS A NICE PENIS.

501
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,607
- THAT'S [bleep]
DISGUSTING.

502
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,709
- I'M--I'LL SAY MY SON
HAS A NICE PENIS.

503
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,043
- UGH!

504
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,513
IT'S A BOY!

505
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:15,282
- AND A BURP.

00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:17,083

507
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,818
- IT ALL FEELS REAL NOW

508
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,620
BECAUSE I KNOW THE SEX
OF THE BABY.

509
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,489
YOU KNOW, THIS IS LIKE
THE REAL DEAL.

510
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:24,857
LIKE I AM HAVING
A BABY BOY.

511
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:27,660
NOW WE GOTTA PLAN
THE BABY SHOWER.

512
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,762
[doll cries]
- OH, COME ON, CHILD.

513
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:33,933
[doll crying]
- JENNI!

514
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,134
- MY BABY!

515
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,503
- I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,

516
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:38,971
WE SHOULD SWAP BOYFRIENDS.

517
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,139
- I THINK
WE'LL NEED A DRINK FIRST.

518
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,408
- MIGHT AS WELL GET
TWO DRINKS.

519
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:42,742
- THE MORE PREGNANT I GET,

520
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,812
THE MORE I FEEL I SHOULD
REALLY BE EXPERIENCING THIS

521
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:48,247
WITH JIONNI
INSTEAD OF JENNI.

522
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,984
I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I NEED
TO BE WITH JIONNI.
