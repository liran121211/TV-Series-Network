1
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:05,212
- SO WHAT'’S THE CONCLUSION?
- WE'’RE GONNA TAKE IT!

2
00:00:05,212 --> 00:00:07,421
- I HAVE A NICOLE
THAT'’S PREGNANT AND ENGAGED.

3
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,699
I DON'’T KNOW WHAT
I'’M GETTING MYSELF INTO.

4
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:12,081
- JENNI, I'’M PUTTING IN
AN OFFICIAL REQUEST

5
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:14,738
FOR JIONNI'’S BACHELOR PARTY.
- NO.

6
00:00:14,738 --> 00:00:16,809
I DON'’T WANT NO DIRTY SKANK
GRINDING ON HIM.

7
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:17,983
- WHY ARE YOU
COOL WITH IT THEN?

8
00:00:17,983 --> 00:00:19,812
- HE WOULD LEAVE ME
IF I WAS LIKE THAT.

9
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:23,540
- [laughs]

10
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,026

17
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:43,664
- I DON'’T MIND

18
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:45,597
I'’M TALKING ABOUT
[bleep] ASS IN THEIR FACE.

19
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:47,081
- NO, JIONNI SAID
STRIPPERS MAKE HIM THROW UP.

20
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,600
- JENNI THINKS THAT SOME GIRL

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,050
COULD CONVINCE ME
THAT IT'’S OKAY TO CHEAT.

22
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,913
- RIGHT, LIKE EVERY OTHER GUY,
IT'’S LIKE THE HANGOVER.

23
00:00:51,913 --> 00:00:53,156
HE THINKS THAT I'’M THAT...

24
00:00:53,156 --> 00:00:54,916
- HE NEVER SAID--
- NO STRIPPERS.

25
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:59,059
- I NEVER SAID, "CHEAT."
I SAID, "DISRESPECT."

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,129
- LIKE I GOTTA
SMELL THE WHORE ON YOU.

27
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:02,027
- TO WHO? TO WHO?
- TO ME.

28
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,787
- SHE DOESN'’T OWE YOU
A DIME OF RESPECT.

29
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:06,100
- YOU DO!

30
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,101
- SO, YOU'’RE TALKING ABOUT ME?
- YEAH.

31
00:01:07,101 --> 00:01:08,585
- I OWE YOU RESPECT
TO NOT GO THERE.

32
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:10,760
- NO, NOT HAVE
A GIRL BE ON YOU.

33
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,037
- OH, MY GOD, JENNI,

34
00:01:12,037 --> 00:01:13,625
THAT'’S JUST HOW IT WORKS
AT A BACHELOR PARTY.

35
00:01:13,625 --> 00:01:15,178
THAT'’S JUST WHAT HAPPENS.
- THAT'’S WHY YOU DON'’T GO.

36
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:16,421
- I DON'’T--I'’M NOT DOING A STRIP
CLUB, JUST TO LET YOU KNOW.

37
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:17,629
- SEE?

38
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:19,700
JIONNI DOESN'’T
LIKE STRIPPERS, SO...

39
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,115
- ALL GUYS SAY
THEY DON'’T LIKE STRIPPERS.

40
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:22,565
- NO, HE REALLY
DOESN'’T LIKE STRIPPERS.

41
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:24,705
- I DON'’T WANNA TALK ABOUT
THE BACHELOR PARTY ANYMORE.

42
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:26,534
TODAY'’S JENNI'’S BIRTHDAY.
LET'’S HAVE FUN.

43
00:01:26,534 --> 00:01:29,951
- I AGREE WITH THAT,
I SECOND THAT.

44
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:32,022
- I THINK STRIPPERS
ARE [bleep] DISGUSTING.

45
00:01:32,022 --> 00:01:34,094
- THANK YOU.
- I MEAN, THEY'’RE SLUTS.

46
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,199
- [bleep] PROSTITUTES.
- YEAH.

47
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:38,374
- YAY.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME.

48
00:01:38,374 --> 00:01:40,410
- BABE,
I JUST GOT BUTTERFLIES!

49
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,205
'’CAUSE I'’M EXCITED
YOU'’RE HERE.

50
00:01:42,205 --> 00:01:43,965
DO YOU GET BUTTERFLIES?

51
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:45,898
- NO. SHE WON'’T EVEN HAVE SEX
WITH ME. YOU KIDDING ME?

52
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,211
I TRY TO HUMP THIS GIRL,
LIKE, FIVE TIMES A DAY.

53
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:49,488
- HOW MANY TIMES
DO YOU MASTURBATE THEN?

54
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:50,731
- A LOT.
- THAT SUCKS.

55
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:52,974
- LET'’S BE--
LET'’S BE HONEST ABOUT IT.

56
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:56,185
- ♪ HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO MY BEST FRIEND ♪

57
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:58,532
- SO WE'’RE ALL GOING OUT FOR
DINNER FOR JENNI'’S BIRTHDAY,

58
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:00,085
AND IT'’S REALLY,
REALLY NICE.

59
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:01,673
IT'’S LIKE A NICE
DOUBLE DATE.

60
00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:04,538
- LAST NIGHT,
I HAD FULL-BLOWN ANXIETY

61
00:02:04,538 --> 00:02:08,369
THINKING 27 WAS
THE END OF MY LIFE.

62
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,440
- SHE HAS THE MOST RIDICULOUS
THOUGHTS OF ANYBODY I KNOW.

63
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,856
- IT'’S ALL RIGHT.

64
00:02:12,856 --> 00:02:13,857
- MY BIOLOGICAL
CLOCK'’S TICKING.

65
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:18,621
- SO IS THAT SAYING
YOU WANT A BABY?

66
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:20,657
- I DON'’T WANT
TO BE AN OLD MOM.

67
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:22,245
- I'’M GONNA BE AN OLD DAD.
I'’M COOL WITH IT.

68
00:02:22,245 --> 00:02:25,110
I WOULD'’VE BEEN IN NO POSITION
TO HAVE A KID AT 27.

69
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,939
I WOULDN'’T HAVE.
BOTTOM LINE.

70
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:29,321
- WHAT ABOUT--WHAT ABOUT 24?
- AT 24 WOULD I HAVE?

71
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:30,736
NO [bleep] WAY, DUDE.

72
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:32,359
- THAT WAS MY PARENTS.
- BUT WE CAN'’T GO BY THAT.

73
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,601
- DID YOU--DID YOU
EXPERIENCE LIFE YET?

74
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:35,431
DID YOU EXPERIENCE
ALL THAT LIFE HAD TO OFFER?

75
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,226
- I EXPERIENCED EVERYTHI--

76
00:02:37,226 --> 00:02:39,055
- DID YOU SOW YOUR WILD OATS,
SO TO SPEAK?

77
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:40,850
- WE'’RE EXPERIENCING IT
RIGHT NOW.

78
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,989
- I EXPERIENCED EVERYTHING
I HAD TO EXPERIENCE.

79
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,508
I WENT AWAY TO COLLEGE.

80
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:45,544
- IT'’S COLLEGE.
IT DOESN'’T COUNT. DOESN'’T COUNT.

81
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:48,513
WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ON IT,
THAT'’S WHEN YOU CAN SAY

82
00:02:48,513 --> 00:02:49,928
YOU'’VE EXPERIENCED EVERYTHING
YOU HAD TO EXPERIENCE.

83
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:51,378
YOU'’RE NOT
LOOKING BACK ON IT.

84
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:52,379
YOU'’RE LIVING IN THE PRESENT
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

85
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,691
[laughs]
- NO...

86
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:57,349
YOU MAKE CHOI--IT'’S--
I HAD A FAKE I.D. FOREVER,

87
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:00,180
I WENT OUT AND DID CRAZY THI--
YOU KNOW, LIKE, I WAS...

88
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,044
- BUT DOES THAT DEFINE
LIVING LIFE TO THE FULLEST?

89
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:04,667
KNOW WHAT I MEAN? LIKE, REALLY?
- ROG, I WENT CRAZY.

90
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,428
- I'’M A BALL-BREAKER BY NATURE.
I'’M JUST A BALL-BREAKER.

91
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:11,260
AND JIONNI AND I ARE KIND OF
HAVING A NEW FRIENDSHIP,

92
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,952
AND IT'’S JUST, LIKE, THIS
PERFECT CANVAS TO MAKE FUN OF.

93
00:03:13,952 --> 00:03:15,436
SO, WHERE DO YOU
SEE YOURSELF IN FIVE YEARS?

94
00:03:15,436 --> 00:03:18,784
- HE WANTS A SPEEDBOAT.
- REALLY?

95
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:21,201
- I WANNA RACE, TO BE HONEST,
BUT SHE WON'’T LET ME RACE.

96
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,203
- BOATS?
- YEAH.

97
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,583
- THERE'’S A THING
CALLED "BOAT RACING"?

98
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,206
- MAN'’S GOT
HIS PRIORITIES IN CHECK.

99
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,587
HE'’S HAVING A KID,
AND HE WANTS TO RACE BOATS.

100
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:31,280
THANK GOD YOU'’RE HANDSOME, BRO,
'’CAUSE YOU'’RE NOT VERY BRIGHT.

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,246
- [laughs]

102
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:34,524
- [chuckling]

103
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:36,077
- WHAT'’S THE MATTER?

104
00:03:36,077 --> 00:03:37,734
IT'’S JUST IDEAS.
IT AIN'’T GONNA HAPPEN.

105
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:39,219
- I'’M KIDDING.
- EVERYBODY'’S A DREAMER.

106
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,082
RIGHT?
- IS SHE MAD? ARE YOU MAD?

107
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:43,223
- YEAH, IT'’S ANNOYING.
- I'’M KIDDING.

108
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,570
- I'’M IGNORING EVERYTHING
THAT ROGER'’S SAYING

109
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,124
JUST BECAUSE
HE'’S INTERROGATING JIONNI,

110
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:49,746
AND YOU KNOW,
IT'’S ANNOYING, AND I'’M--

111
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:51,369
I'’M KIND OF
GETTING DEFENSIVE FOR JIONNI.

112
00:03:51,369 --> 00:03:53,405
LIKE, DON'’T [bleep]
TALK TO MY MAN LIKE THAT.

113
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:55,890
YOU'’RE ANNOYING.

114
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,927
- I'’M NOT GONNA
GET A BOAT.

115
00:03:57,927 --> 00:04:01,517
- THEN STOP TALKING ABOUT IT.
- ALL RIGHT.

116
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,967
[clears throat]
- [laughs]

117
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:11,492

OH, MY GOD, HE DID NOT.

119
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:16,773
YOU DON'’T SING
THE OOMPA LOOMPA SONG.

120
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:19,189

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,574
- YOU'’RE CRUNCHING HIM.

- YOU DON'’T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM?
- [laughs]

124
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,996

00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:34,377
ALL RIGHT, COME OVER HERE.

- CAN I HAVE SOME

00:04:59,057 --> 00:05:01,404
- YOU COULD PRACTICE.
PRACTICE FOR HAVING A KID, DUDE.

DO THE AIRPLANE.

- GET OUTTA HERE.
[laughs]

146
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:14,866
- LET'’S BE HONEST
ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE.

147
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,661
IF WE HAD A KID, YOU'’D BE
THE SAME SIZE AS OUR KID.

148
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,319
[laughs]
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I SWEAR TO GOD.

149
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,975
- I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE

150
00:05:20,975 --> 00:05:23,012

ALL THE TIME.

151
00:05:23,012 --> 00:05:25,083

NO, I KNOW.

00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:51,972
- SEE THE BABY MOVING AROUND?
- EWW!

164
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:53,698
- OH, IT'’S SO CUTE.

165
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,458
- OH, I'’M GONNA THROW UP.

166
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,115
- HOW AM I ABOUT TO CRY,

167
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:58,496
AND YOU'’RE, LIKE,
GONNA THROW UP?

168
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:06,952

169
00:06:06,952 --> 00:06:09,576
- ME AND NICOLE NEED DRAPES.

170
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:11,509
WE NEED SOMETHING

171
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,373
SO WE'’RE GONNA
GO TO A FEW STORES,

172
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,721

00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:20,000

DECORATING.

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,346

00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:27,801
SO IT'’S JUST
MORE GAUDY AND OUTRAGEOUS.

178
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,010
'’CAUSE THEN I'’LL REALLY
FEEL LIKE IT'’S MY HOME.

179
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,253
I LIKE THIS.
IT MATCHES MY TATTOO.

180
00:06:32,253 --> 00:06:34,255
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

181
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:36,568
- I DEFINITELY
LIKE THE BLACK SHINY...

182
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:38,950
- I WANT ANIMAL PRINT.
I WANT IT VERY TACKY.

183
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,054
- [laughs]

184
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,539
- YEAH, IF I COULD
HAVE THAT BUT BLACK,

185
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:42,678
IT WOULD BE BEAUTIFUL.

186
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:45,059
- I LIKE THAT SOUND.

187
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:47,096
- YOU LIKE THESE TWO TOGETHER?
- MM-HMM.

188
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:49,270
I LOVE THAT.
- MISSION ACCOMPLISHED?

189
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,686
- YEAH.

190
00:06:50,686 --> 00:06:55,207
- GRAND TOTAL...
$1,132.40.

191
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,623
- OH, MY GOD.

192
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:59,729
I CAN BUY, LIKE,
A LOUIS VUITTON BAG FOR THAT.

193
00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:03,284
AND I, LIKE, [bleep] MYSELF
WHEN I BUY THOSE TYPE OF BAGS.

194
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:06,011
- COULD YOU ASK THEM
FOR A BIGGER DISCOUNT?

195
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,703
- OKAY.
- OKAY?

196
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,394
- [laughs]

197
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:10,706
- WHY NOT?

198
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:12,777
- PLEASE.
- ALL RIGHT.

199
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,399
- YOU DO THE SAD LIP,

200
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:16,781
AND THEN YOU DO, LIKE,
THE BATTING OF THE EYES,

201
00:07:16,781 --> 00:07:18,886
AND THOSE--MOSTLY WORKS.

202
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:20,267
UNLESS YOU'’RE A GRENADE.

203
00:07:20,267 --> 00:07:24,374
- SO, IT'’S 642 FOR THE BOTH.
- I LOVE YOU!

204
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:26,411
- OKAY, THANKS FOR COMING IN.
- THANK YOU.

205
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:29,449
- GOOD LUCK WITH THE NEW HOUSE.
- THANK YOU. BYE.

206
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:36,214
DO YOU LIKE COW?
- COW SKIN?

207
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:37,940
- YEAH.
- OOH, I LIKE THAT.

208
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,735
EVERY STORE
SHOULD HAVE ANIMAL PRINT,

209
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:42,047
BECAUSE IF THEY DON'’T,
THEN IT'’S A REALLY BORING STORE,

210
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,601
AND I WOULD NEVER GO IN IT.

211
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:45,257
JENNI.
- YEAH?

212
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,744
- LOOK.

213
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,470
- I'’M REALLY
GETTING ANNOYED AT, LIKE,

214
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,231
THE BABY/WEDDING FEVER GOING--
- I LOVE IT!

215
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:54,612
- YEAH...
- [giggles]

216
00:07:54,612 --> 00:07:55,923
- THANKS FOR YELLING
IN MY [bleep] EAR.

217
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:58,892
[sighs]

218
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,523
OH...

219
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:13,631
NOTHING HAPPENED.
I'’M OKAY.

220
00:08:13,631 --> 00:08:17,082
SORRY.

221
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:19,291
- OH, MY GOD, I REALLY
HAVE TO FREAKIN'’ POOP.

222
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,569
ALL I'’M THINKING IS,

223
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:22,260
"OH, MY GOD,
I HAVE TO POOP SO BAD,"

224
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,572
AND YOU SHOULDN'’T
HOLD YOUR POOP IN,

225
00:08:23,572 --> 00:08:26,885
ESPECIALLY WHEN
YOU'’RE PREGGERS,

226
00:08:26,885 --> 00:08:29,163
BECAUSE TECHNICALLY,
I'’M POOPING FOR TWO PEOPLE,

227
00:08:29,163 --> 00:08:30,682
SO WHEN YOU
HOLD IN YOUR POOP,

228
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:33,374
YOU'’RE JUST BACKING UP
YOUR KID'’S POOP.

229
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:34,893
AND I FEEL LIKE
THAT'’S NOT HEALTHY.

230
00:08:34,893 --> 00:08:38,000
I'’M SORRY,
BUT I REALLY HAVE TO POOP.

231
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,968
- JUST GO,
'’CAUSE YOU'’RE ANNOYING ME NOW.

232
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:42,763
[laughs]

233
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:44,282
- IT KEEPS DOING THIS.

234
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:46,180
- IT'’S PUCKERING.
JUST GO.

235
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,044
UGH...

236
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:51,151
- BYE.

237
00:08:51,151 --> 00:08:54,430
OH, MY GOD,
THERE'’S ALREADY POOP IN THERE.

238
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,674
OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT'’S THE PROBLEM?

239
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:57,640
- THERE'’S ALREADY
POOP IN THE TOILET.

240
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,193
- THERE IS?

241
00:08:59,193 --> 00:09:00,643
- SO, I WALK
INTO THE BATHROOM,

242
00:09:00,643 --> 00:09:01,989
AND THERE'’S
ALREADY [bleep] TURDS

243
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:03,197
JUST CHILLIN'’
IN THE TOILET,

244
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:05,683
SO, I'’M LIKE, "I AM NOT POOPING
IN THIS PLACE."

245
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:07,339
- WHY DON'’T YOU JUST
FLUSH THE TOILET?

246
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,824
- BECAUSE IT'’S WEIRD.

247
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:10,653
AND THERE'’S LITTLE TURDS
LOOKING AT ME.

248
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:13,242
- THINK YOU GOT
POOP PARTICLES ON YOU?

249
00:09:13,242 --> 00:09:14,657
- YEAH,
AND I TOUCHED THE LIGHT.

250
00:09:14,657 --> 00:09:18,178
- ALL RIGHT, I THINK WE'’RE READY
TO GET OUR STUFF, MISTER.

251
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:20,421
- YES.
- THANK YOU.

252
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:21,561
- THANKS A LOT.
I APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS.

253
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,562
- HAVE A NICE DAY.

254
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,633
[dance music]

255
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:25,806
- I'’M EXCITED FOR TONIGHT.

256
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:27,912
- I'’M EXCITED
FOR THE SEX MUSEUM.

257
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:30,224
YOU THINK THEY'’RE
ACTUALLY GONNA DO SEX?

258
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:31,536
- I DON'’T KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

259
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:33,331
- IS THAT LEGAL?

260
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:35,298
- I FEEL LIKE A BREAK AWAY
FROM WHAT WE'’VE BEEN DOING

261
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:36,714
IS MUCH-NEEDED.

262
00:09:36,714 --> 00:09:39,924
WE WANNA DO THE SEX MUSEUM,
WE WANNA GO TO NINJA DINNER.

263
00:09:39,924 --> 00:09:42,202
- JUST TO GET OUTTA JERSEY CITY
FOR A LITTLE BIT,

264
00:09:42,202 --> 00:09:44,480
AND GO TO NEW YORK CITY.
I'’M REALLY EXCITED.

265
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,515
- I CAN'’T WAIT.

266
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:47,483
MUSEUM OF SEX.

267
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:49,761
- OH, THIS IS A STORE.

268
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:51,452
- REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS ARE HERE.
WELCOME TO THE MUSEUM OF SEX.

269
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:53,489
- OOH, WHAT IS THAT,
ANAL BEADS?

270
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:55,042
SO, WE GET
TO THE SEX MUSEUM,

271
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:58,425
AND THAT'’S EXACTLY
WHAT IT'’S ABOUT--SEX.

272
00:09:58,425 --> 00:09:59,460
A LITTLE SHOCKED.

273
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,566
- EWW!

274
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,879
THERE'’S SPRINKLES ON IT.
- [laughs]

275
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,846
- THAT MUST REALLY HURT
WHEN YOU PUT IT IN YOUR [bleep].

276
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:07,503
IT'’S EITHER FOR SHOW,

277
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:09,436
OR PEOPLE REALLY LIKE
TO [bleep] SPRINKLES.

278
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:12,853
- "PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH, LICK,
STROKE, OR MOUNT THE EXHIBITS."

279
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:13,992
- REALLY?

280
00:10:13,992 --> 00:10:14,959
- IT'’S BEEN A PROBLEM
IN THE PAST.

281
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,132
- REALLY?
- PERVERTS.

282
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,582
- I'’M [bleep] FREAKED OUT,

283
00:10:17,582 --> 00:10:19,377
AND I AM LIKE, "WHAT THE [bleep]
DID WE GET OURSELVES INTO?"

284
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:20,827
I FEEL LIKE A VIRGIN
IN THIS PLACE.

285
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:23,588
- SO HOW MUCH DO YOU GUYS
KNOW ABOUT ANIMAL SEX?

286
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:24,624
- NO.
- NO? NOT AT ALL?

287
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,660
- I NEVER HAD SEX
WITH AN ANIMAL.

288
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,007
- WELL, I WOULD HOPE NOT.
- ISN'’T THAT ILLEGAL?

289
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:30,388
- I DIDN'’T EVEN KNOW
THEY WOULD HAVE

290
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:33,287
AN ANIMAL SEX EXHIBIT
AT THE SEX MUSEUM.

291
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:35,773
- THOSE ARE BONOBOS.
THOSE ARE ACTUALLY TWO FEMALES.

292
00:10:35,773 --> 00:10:37,775
- SO, MONKEYS HAVE,
LIKE, LESBIAN SEX?

293
00:10:37,775 --> 00:10:40,363
- THEY DO.
- ROGER CALLS ME "MONKEY."

294
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:41,986
IT'’S GONNA TAKE A WHILE FOR
ROGER TO CALL ME MONKEY AGAIN

295
00:10:41,986 --> 00:10:43,919
BEFORE I STOP
VISUALIZING TWO [bleep]

296
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,437
RUBBING AGAINST EACH OTHER.

297
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,786
WHAT'’S WITH THE THREESOME?
- OH, DEERS HAVE THREESOMES?

298
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:50,408
- MM-HMM.
- NO WAY.

299
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:51,443
- BUT THAT'’S
ANOTHER MAN ON A MAN.

300
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,723
- MM-HMM.
- SO, DEER CAN BE GAY.

301
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:57,726
- IT'’S VERY COMMON FOR DEERS
TO HAVE THREESOMES.

302
00:10:57,726 --> 00:10:59,279
- OH, SEE, YEAH,
THE LITTLE ROCKETS. LOOK.

303
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,487
ME AND JENNI LEARNED

304
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:02,662
THAT MOTHER NATURE
IS ACTUALLY FREAKY.

305
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,560
- LET'’S PAY FOR OUR DILDOS
AND GO TO DINNER.

306
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,287
- [laughs]

307
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:10,186
- TABLE FOR TWO.
- FOR TWO? ALL RIGHTY.

308
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:14,259
IT'’S BASED ON A 16th CENTURY
JAPANESE CASTLE.

309
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:16,054
- IT'’S A WHAT?
- OOH, JAPANESE.

310
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:17,677
- JAPANESE, YEAH.

311
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,817
SO KEEP YOUR
EYES PEELED FOR NINJAS.

312
00:11:19,817 --> 00:11:21,094
GOOD LUCK.

313
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:23,786
- OH, [bleep].
- THEY'’RE GONNA ATTACK US?

314
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:26,340
SO, WE WALK INTO NINJA, AND
RIGHT AWAY, THE HOSTESS IS LIKE,

315
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,583
"BE CAREFUL,"

316
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,895
AND I'’M LIKE,
"BITCH, I'’M PREGNANT.

317
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,759
IF SOMEONE [bleep] HITS ME,
I'’M GONNA KILL SOMEONE."

318
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,072
LIKE, THEY'’RE GONNA
COME OUTTA THE WALLS.

319
00:11:34,072 --> 00:11:35,384
JENNI, I DON'’T LIKE THAT.

320
00:11:35,384 --> 00:11:40,389
IS THIS A HAUNTED HOUSE?
- SHH. SHH.

321
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:41,735
- AAH!
girls: [scream]

322
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:42,736
- OH, MY GOD!

323
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:45,118
- I JUST [bleep]!

324
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:47,534
- COME ON IN, LADIES. WELCOME.
- I'’M NOT KIDDING, I JUST PEED.

325
00:11:47,534 --> 00:11:51,711
[giggling]

326
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,644
I BEEN HOLDING IN MY PEE
FOR 20 MINUTES.

327
00:11:54,644 --> 00:11:56,508
THANK YOU,
I JUST PEED MY PANTS.

328
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,889
- OH, MY GOD.
- I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

329
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:00,720
- COME ON, LADIES, ALL RIGHT.
- I'’M SO SCARED.

330
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,516
- I DIDN'’T KNOW THIS WAS
A [bleep] HAUNTED HOUSE.

331
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,070
JENNI?

332
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,899
- AAH!
- [screams]

333
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:10,281
- JESUS [bleep]!

334
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:11,800
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?
[laughter]

335
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,008
- LURKING IN THE SHADOWS,
LADIES.

336
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:15,113
YOU'’RE ONE STEP CLOSER.
COME ON, FOLLOW ME.

337
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:16,701
- [laughing hysterically]
- STOP.

338
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:19,428
WE LITERALLY
ARE TINKLING DOWN OUR LEGS,

339
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:20,463
BECAUSE WE GOT
SCARED [bleep]-LESS.

340
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:21,741
- BY A NINJA.

341
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,019
OH, MY GOD. YOUR FACE
WAS PRICELESS, BY THE WAY.

342
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:26,159
- WHAT'’D I DO?

343
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,781
[laughs]

344
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:28,955
THAT PLACE CREEPED ME OUT.

345
00:12:28,955 --> 00:12:30,715
I-I WAS TURNED OFF
WHEN I LEFT.

346
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:33,960
YOU WEREN'’T?
- NOT REALLY.

347
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,238
IF THE ANIMALS WEREN'’T THERE,
IT WOULD'’VE BEEN A GREAT MUSEUM.

348
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:39,068
AFTER SEEING THE SEX MUSEUM,
I LIKE MY SEX

349
00:12:39,068 --> 00:12:40,794
THE WAY I LIKE IT.
- ME TOO.

350
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:43,141
- I THINK IF THE BOYS
CAME TO THE SEX MUSEUM,

351
00:12:43,141 --> 00:12:46,006
ME AND JIONNI WOULD BE
HAVING SEX IN THE BATHROOM.

352
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:47,076
- YOU'’RE A PIG.

353
00:12:47,076 --> 00:12:49,976
- THAT'’S NOT FUNNY.
- [snorts]

354
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:51,115
- THAT WAS MEAN.

355
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:53,186
I FEEL LIKE JENNI
JUST CALLED ME FAT.

356
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:54,532
CRUEL.

357
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:56,637
- SORRY, I PICTURED
AN ANIMAL WHEN YOU SAID THAT.

358
00:12:56,637 --> 00:12:58,467
- WHY?

359
00:12:58,467 --> 00:13:00,089
- '’CAUSE WE JUST SAW
ANIMALS HAVING SEX.

360
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:01,850
I THINK NICOLE,
BEING PREGNANT,

361
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,679
IS TRYING TO ADJUST
TO HER SIZE.

362
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,475
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD'’VE THOUGHT
ABOUT CALLING HER A PIG,

363
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:08,511
AND MAYBE WENT WITH
A DEER OR A DUCK.

364
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:10,582
ONLY YOU WOULD
BE ABLE TO HAVE SEX

365
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:13,240
AFTER YOU SAW
PIGS AND ANIMALS HAVE SEX.

366
00:13:18,107 --> 00:13:22,077
- I'’M DONE.
GET THIS FOOD AWAY FROM ME.

367
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:23,043
- ARGH!

368
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:25,632
- [screams]

369
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:28,393
SERIOUSLY!
- PSYCHO!

370
00:13:28,393 --> 00:13:30,430
ME AND NICOLE ARE
VERY PARANOID AT THIS POINT.

371
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,847
SO, WE'’RE WATCHING EVERY CORNER,
EVERY CREVICE--

372
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,885
WE'’RE LITERALLY TRYING TO RUN
OUT OF NINJA AS FAST AS WE CAN.

373
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:38,472
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'’RE WELCOME.

374
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:39,508
- ARGH!
girls: [scream]

375
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:42,028
I HATE YOU!
- [laughs]

376
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,208
- WAKEY-WAKEY, PREGNANT ONE.

377
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,900
- I'’M SO TIRED.

378
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,453
- YOU GOTTA GET UP.
IT'’S LIKE NOON.

379
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:55,179
SO, IT'’S A BEAUTIFUL DAY OUT
IN JERSEY CITY.

380
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:56,628
IT'’S NICE AND WARM,

381
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,838
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF SHOPPING
TO DO FOR THE HOUSE.

382
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,425
- HEY, LADIES,
WHAT'’S GOING ON?

383
00:14:00,425 --> 00:14:03,290
- HI.
- ARE YOU PREGNANT?

384
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,915
- I'’M DUE NEXT WEEK.
- WHOO. GOOD LUCK.

385
00:14:06,915 --> 00:14:08,364
- WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?
DO YOU KNOW?

386
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:10,228
- I DON'’T KNOW,
I LIKE THE SURPRISE.

387
00:14:10,228 --> 00:14:11,712
- REALLY? DOES IT HURT?
- LOOK AT YOU.

388
00:14:11,712 --> 00:14:13,231
- IT'’S GONNA HURT LIKE HELL
WHEN YOU PUSH THAT KID OUT.

389
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:14,577
- DID YOU GET THE EPIDURAL?

390
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:15,993
- HELL, YEAH.
- [laughs]

391
00:14:15,993 --> 00:14:17,546
- AND DID IT HURT?
DID IT HURT AT ALL?

392
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:19,789
I RUN INTO THIS
PREGNANT LADY NAMED MEGAN,

393
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:21,999
AND SHE'’S AWESOME,
SO I'’M JUST, LIKE,

394
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:24,829
ASKING QUESTIONS, BECAUSE I
HAVEN'’T REALLY TALKED TO ANYONE

395
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,003
THAT HAS BEEN PREGNANT.

396
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:27,832
LIKE, I DON'’T KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT,

397
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:28,868
OR WHAT'’S GOING ON.

398
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,628
DOES YOUR VAGINA
RIP TO YOUR BUTTHOLE?

399
00:14:30,628 --> 00:14:32,526
- YEAH, I MEAN, IT CAN.
- UGH!

400
00:14:32,526 --> 00:14:33,907
- DID YOURS?
- YOU NEED A GOOD DOCTOR.

401
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,012
YOU NEED A GOOD DOCTOR.
- I HAVE A GOOD DOCTOR.

402
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:36,013
- I HAD ONE STITCH.

403
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:38,118
- WELL, I DEFINITELY KNEW

404
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:39,982
THAT YOUR VAGINA
RIPS TO YOUR BUTTHOLE,

405
00:14:39,982 --> 00:14:42,571
SO THE FACT
THAT SHE DID CONFIRM...

406
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:44,193
UGH.
THAT REALLY SCARES ME.

407
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:46,299
DOES IT FEEL LIKE
WHEN YOU HOLD FARTS IN?

408
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,265
- OH, NO, IT'’S SO MUCH
WORSE THAN THAT.

409
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:48,473
- [laughs]

410
00:14:48,473 --> 00:14:49,440
- OH, I READ IN A BOOK
IT FEELS LIKE THAT.

411
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,993
- THE THING ABOUT IT IS--

412
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:53,133
IT'’S LIKE, ONCE YOU DO IT,
YOU'’RE LIKE,

413
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,548
"[bleep] HIGH FIVE!"
LIKE, YOU CAN'’T--

414
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:55,895
[laughter]

415
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,482
- LIKE, YOU JUST
FEEL LIKE YOU JUST DID

416
00:14:57,482 --> 00:14:59,553
THE MOST AMAZING THING
ON THE PLANET,

417
00:14:59,553 --> 00:15:01,003
AND LIKE,
NOBODY CAN MESS WITH YOU.

418
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:02,763
- THIS LADY
BASICALLY BROKE DOWN

419
00:15:02,763 --> 00:15:04,800
WHAT PREGNANCY IS ABOUT
TO NICOLE,

420
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,733
AND I'’M KIND OF GLAD
NICOLE MET THIS LADY

421
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:08,873
SO SHE CAN HAVE SOMEONE
TO TALK TO HER

422
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:10,185
AND BE STRAIGHT-UP
WITH HER.

423
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:12,014
I'’M SO GLAD WE CAME BACK.
- BYE. GOOD LUCK.

424
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:13,429
- BYE, GUYS.

425
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:14,844
SEE YOU LATER.

426
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:16,916
- I WANNA BE LIKE HER
AT [bleep] NINE MONTHS,

427
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,848
READY TO POP.

428
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:25,441
- SO WHAT'’S
TODAY'’S CHECKUP LIKE?

429
00:15:25,441 --> 00:15:28,858
- TO TEST IF IT'’S--
HAS DOWN'’S SYNDROME.

430
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:31,413
- THAT'’S TODAY?
- YEAH.

431
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:32,690
- SO, TONIGHT I HAVE
MY DOCTOR'’S APPOINTMENT,

432
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,934
AND I'’M VERY, VERY NERVOUS.

433
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,728
I FEEL LIKE ALL DAY
I'’M ON EDGE,

434
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:37,937
AND ALL I'’M THINKING ABOUT IS,
"OH, MY GOD,

435
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,317
WHAT IF MY BABY
ISN'’T HEALTHY?"

436
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:41,768
- DO YOU LIKE
YOUR DOCTOR, THOUGH?

437
00:15:41,768 --> 00:15:43,287
- YEAH.
HE DELIVERED JIONNI.

438
00:15:43,287 --> 00:15:44,944
- OH, REALLY? YOU'’RE GOING
TO JIONNI'’S MOM'’S DOCTOR?

439
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,152
- MM-HMM.

440
00:15:46,152 --> 00:15:48,948
JIONNI'’S MOM, SISTER, AUNT...
- REALLY?

441
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,640
- IT'’S WEIRD, THOUGH, '’CAUSE
HE LOOKED AT ALL OF OUR VAGINAS.

442
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,987
- THE DOCTOR IS AN OB/GYN.

443
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,093
I DON'’T KNOW
WHAT THAT STANDS FOR,

444
00:15:56,093 --> 00:15:59,061
BUT ALL I KNOW
IS IT DELIVERS BABIES.

445
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:01,408
- YOU READY TO GO
GET YOUR BELLY LOOKED AT?

446
00:16:01,408 --> 00:16:04,411
- UGH, GOD...
- LET'’S DO THIS.

447
00:16:04,411 --> 00:16:07,967
- MY BIGGEST FEAR
ABOUT TONIGHT'’S APPOINTMENT

448
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,210
IS THAT, YOU KNOW,
MY BABY IS NOT GROWING RIGHT,

449
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,660
AND IT'’S, LIKE,
NOT GONNA LIVE.

450
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,696
I MEAN, IT'’S VERY,
VERY STRESSFUL.

451
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:20,013
- I'’M EXCITED TO SEE
WHAT THE BABY LOOKS LIKE.

452
00:16:22,153 --> 00:16:24,914
- IT'’S A LONG WAYS
TO GO, HONEY.

453
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:26,813
- I'’M REALLY NERVOUS
FOR NICOLE RIGHT NOW,

454
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,056
BUT I DON'’T WANNA SHOW IT.

455
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:29,505
I WANNA BE SUPPORTIVE,
AND I WANNA KIND OF, LIKE,

456
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:31,818
SNAP NICOLE
OUT OF BEING NERVOUS.

457
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:34,614
KIND OF LIKE WHAT ROGER
OR SOMEONE WOULD DO FOR ME

458
00:16:34,614 --> 00:16:36,478
WHEN I START, LIKE,
MAKING MY HEAD SPIN.

459
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:38,756
- LIKE, AFTER THIS ONE,
I'’LL BE FINE,

460
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:40,309
'’CAUSE I KNOW
EVERYTHING'’S OKAY,

461
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:42,829
BUT THIS IS THE TEST
TO MAKE SURE IT IS OKAY.

462
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:45,245
- I'’M EXCITED FOR YOU.

463
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:48,386
- I'’M REALLY NERVOUS.

464
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:54,806
- THERE'’S MORE
SNOOKI &amp; JWOWWON THE WAY,

465
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,809
AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

466
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:00,122
- HERE WE GO.

467
00:17:00,122 --> 00:17:01,813
- I HAVE TO PEE
REALLY BAD, HONEY.

468
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,539
- HI.

469
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:04,851
- HEY.
- LONG TIME.

470
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,473
- NERVOUS?
- YEAH.

471
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:08,268
WALKING INTO
THIS DR.'’S APPOINTMENT,

472
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:11,030
IT MEANS SO MUCH THAT
I HAVE MY BEST FRIEND HERE,

473
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,515
AND JIONNI, WHO IS
SO EXCITED TO BE A DAD.

474
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:14,999
IT'’S AWESOME.

475
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:17,381
IT'’S JUST A GREAT FEELING
TO HAVE LOVE, LIKE, EVERYWHERE.

476
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:20,556
- HEY, GUYS. HOW YOU DOING?
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?

477
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:22,041
- HOW YOU DOIN'’?
HEY, JIONNI, HOW ARE YOU?

478
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,042

479
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,112
- HI.

00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:25,285
- ALL RIGHT.

481
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,321
- OH, MY GOD.

482
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:27,529
- HOPEFULLY,
THE, UH, BABY BEHAVES.

483
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:29,462
AND SHE'’LL GET THE PICTURES
THAT SHE NEEDS.

484
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:30,911
- WE'’LL GET THIS DONE.

485
00:17:30,911 --> 00:17:33,121
- SO HOW YOU BEEN FEELIN'’?

486
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:34,674
- EXHAUSTED.

00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:37,815
- REALLY FRICKIN'’ BITCHY.

488
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:39,403
- SO CRANKY. MISERABLE.

489
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:40,611
- IS THAT TRUE?
- YEAH.

490
00:17:40,611 --> 00:17:41,784
- AM I INTERRUPTING?
- HI. COME ON IN.

491
00:17:41,784 --> 00:17:43,441
- LET'’S GO.
- COME ON IN.

492
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,029
- I'’M SWEATING,
I'’M SO NERVOUS.

493
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,858
IS THIS YOUR FAMILY DOCTOR?
- YES.

494
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,067
HI. I HEARD ALL ABOUT YOU.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

495
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,275
HOW YOU DOIN'’?
- JENNI.

496
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:50,966
- YOU SAW ALL THE VAGINAS
IN HIS FAMILY, I HEARD.

497
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:53,037
- OH, BOY. OH, BOY.
- THAT'’S NOT A BAD THING.

498
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,556
- YOU WANT THIS BACK?
- YEAH, PLEASE.

499
00:17:54,556 --> 00:17:55,867
- OKAY.

500
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,284
- I'’M SWEATING RIGHT NOW,
I'’M SO NERVOUS.

501
00:17:58,284 --> 00:18:01,080
- JENNI'’S THE GODMOTHER.
- THE GOD--

502
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,429
- DON'’T MAKE ME CRY.

503
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:07,569
IS THAT IT?
- YES, IT IS.

504
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:10,365
KID'’S STANDING ON HIS HEAD.
[laughs]

505
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:13,368
- STANDING ON ITS HEAD?
- WORST POSITION TO--[laughs]

506
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:15,128
- THAT HIS HEAD?
- THE LITTLE ARMS, LITTLE LEGS.

507
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:18,062
- SEE THE BABY MOVING AROUND?
- EWW!

508
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:20,927
- OH, IT'’S SO CUTE.
- THERE'’S THE LITTLE LEGS.

509
00:18:20,927 --> 00:18:22,308
THERE'’S THE HEAD.
- IT'’S MOVING?

510
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:24,206
- IT'’S MOVING.
- YUP.

511
00:18:24,206 --> 00:18:26,277
- OH, I GOTTA THROW UP.
[laughter]

512
00:18:26,277 --> 00:18:28,037
- HOW AM I ABOUT TO CRY,

513
00:18:28,037 --> 00:18:29,177
AND YOU'’RE, LIKE,
GONNA THROW UP?

514
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:31,179
- I WAS LIKE, "EWW!"
'’CAUSE IT--

515
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:32,387
IT LOOKED LIKE AN ALIEN.

516
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,078
- WHEN SHE SCREAMED "EW,"
I ALMOST--

517
00:18:34,078 --> 00:18:35,976
- [giggles]
- I-I CHOKED BACK THE TEARS,

518
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:37,944
'’CAUSE I'’M LIKE, "GREAT,
THE MOM'’S NOT EVEN CRYING."

519
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:39,325
IT WAS JUST DOING
BACK FLIPS FOR YOU.

520
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,705
- CAN YOU TELL
IF IT'’S A BOY OR GIRL YET?

521
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:42,914
- NO, IT'’S A LITTLE SOON.
UH, LIKE, 20 WEEKS.

522
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,124
- SEEING MY CHILD
FOR THE FIRST TIME,

523
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,643
LIKE, ACTUALLY ON THIS SCREEN,
LIKE, THIS IS REAL.

524
00:18:47,643 --> 00:18:48,748
LIKE, LIKE,
IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

525
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:51,509
IT WAS A REAL
EXCITING MOMENT FOR US.

526
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,167
- THIS IS THE BABY'’S HEAD.
THIS IS LIKE A PROFILE.

527
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,514
- YOU CAN SEE THE NOSE, AND...
- THIS IS THE LITTLE NOSE,

528
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:57,653
AND NASAL BONES...
- COOL.

529
00:18:57,653 --> 00:19:02,106
- YOU CREATED THAT.
DRUNK NIGHT.

530
00:19:02,106 --> 00:19:03,970
- NO!

531
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:08,147
[baby'’s heartbeat]
- THAT'’S THE HEARTBEAT.

532
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,321
- HOW'’S IT SOUND? GOOD?
- VERY GOOD.

533
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:12,151
- NORMAL?
- MM-HMM.

534
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,497
- OH, YES.

535
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:15,223
- YOUR LITTLE BABY.

536
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:18,778
- IT HAS YOUR BIG NOSE.
- [laughs]

537
00:19:18,778 --> 00:19:19,917
- I HAVE A BIG NOSE?

538
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:21,470
SHE GOES,
"AH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEANT.

539
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,679
YOUR CUTE, LITTLE NOSE."
NOT WHAT YOU SAID.

540
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,129
YOU SAID I HAVE A BIG NOSE.
IT'’S OKAY.

541
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,234
I DON'’T HAVE A BIG NOSE.

542
00:19:26,234 --> 00:19:28,339
I DON'’T KNOW WHY
SHE EVEN SAID THAT.

543
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:30,824
- EXACTLY.
- IT'’S JUST SO CRAZY TO ME.

544
00:19:30,824 --> 00:19:32,585
- DOC, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
EVERYTHING'’S ALL RIGHT SO FAR?

545
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:34,173
- LOOKS GOOD, YEAH.
- YEAH.

546
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,175
- DR. RUSSO SAID
THAT THE BABY'’S AWESOME.

547
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,695
THE BABY LOOKS FINE,
EVERYTHING LOOKS PROPORTIONAL.

548
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:41,766
AND YOU KNOW,
THAT WAS A RELIEF TO HEAR,

549
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:43,354
BECAUSE I WAS SO WORRIED
OVER NOTHING,

550
00:19:43,354 --> 00:19:45,080
BUT I GUESS THAT'’S
WHAT MOTHERHOOD IS.

551
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,082
ALWAYS WORRYING
ABOUT YOUR KID.

552
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:50,327
- PRAYING FOR A LOT OF THINS.
- I LOVE HIM ALREADY.

553
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:51,293
OH, MY GOD,
I LOVE HIM. OR HER.

554
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:52,674
- LOOK AT THE LEG.

555
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,538
- I KNOW, ISN'’T IT AMAZING,
JUST THE DEFINITION?

556
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:57,679
THE LITTLE LEGS. THE LITTLE LEGS
HERE, THAT LITTLE FOOT.

557
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,510
- I AM FEELING
SO MANY HAPPY EMOTIONS,

558
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,236
TO THE POINT WHERE
I JUST WANNA START CRYING,

559
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:05,100
BECAUSE THIS IS
MY LITTLE GODBABY.

560
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,240
LIKE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS
GONNA BE MY NIECE OR NEPHEW.

561
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,449
- YOU WANT TO TAKE THESE,
OR YOU WANT ME TO TAKE '’EM?

562
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:12,556
WANNA TAKE ONE OR TWO?
- NO, LET ME TAKE--

563
00:20:12,556 --> 00:20:15,455
THE DOCTOR'’S APPOINTMENT,
OVERALL, I GIVE AN "A" PLUS,

564
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:19,148
BECAUSE EVERYTHING WENT WELL,
I HAD TWO PEOPLE THAT I LOVE,

565
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:21,012
BABY WAS HEALTHY,
AND IT WAS REALLY COOL

566
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,601
TO SEE IT FLIP AROUND
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

567
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:25,569
SO, I'’M REALLY HAPPY WITH HOW
THE DOCTOR'’S APPOINTMENT WENT.

568
00:20:25,569 --> 00:20:26,570
- HAVE ALL OF THESE
PAPERS HERE.

569
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:29,711
- THIS LITTLE,
FAT MEATBALL.

570
00:20:29,711 --> 00:20:31,713
- LOOKS LIKE A SHRIMP.
- TAKES--TAKES AFTER US.

571
00:20:31,713 --> 00:20:33,266
- [giggles]

572
00:20:36,131 --> 00:20:38,237
- I THINK WE SHOULD
INVITE THE ROOMMATES OVER.

573
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,169
- HI.
- THIS IS AMAZING.

574
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:41,585
WHO WOULD EVER THOUGHT

575
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:43,103
WE'’D BE AT SNOOKI
AND JENNI'’S HOUSE FOR DINNER?

576
00:20:43,103 --> 00:20:45,140
- THE REAL REASON
WHY I INVITED YOU GUYS HERE...

577
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,383
- UH-OH.

578
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:49,627
- IS BECAUSE
ME AND JIONNI ARE ENGAGED.

579
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:50,904
- WHAT?
- WOW!

580
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:52,596
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

581
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:55,323
- I'’M A LITTLE UPSET
ABOUT THIS.
