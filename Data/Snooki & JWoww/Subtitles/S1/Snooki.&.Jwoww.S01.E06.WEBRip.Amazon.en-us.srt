THAT NICOLE'S PULLING
THE PREGNANT CARD

AT ALL.

EVERYONE'S GETTING PLASTERED,
AND I CAN'T.

YOU'RE PREGNANT

70
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,243
DOESN'T MEAN YOU DEVELOP A STICK
GOING THROUGH YOUR [bleep].

YOU CAN REMOVE THE STICK AND
SHAKE YOUR ASS A LITTLE BIT.

ADOPTION DOGS ALSO.

TO BE A VET TECH,

122
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,611
BUT I'M MORE OF
A CAT PERSON.

00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,994
YOU KNOW, I NEVER REALLY DID
ANYTHING WITH MY SCHOOLING.

WHERE DO I SIGN?

BUT, SHE WANTS TO DO IT,

138

YOUR FIRST BOYFRIEND?

IT WAS INNOCENT.

I WAS, LIKE, 10 OR 11.

I DON'T EVEN THINK
WE KISSED.

- WHEN'S THE FIRST TIME
YOU MADE OUT?

160
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:18,519
- I CAN'T REMEMBER.

161
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,888
- HOW DO YOU NOT
REMEMBER THAT?

162
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,990
- I REMEMBER TAKING
SOMEONE'S VIRGINITY.

163
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,625
THAT WAS FUN.
- OH, ME TOO.

164
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,759
- WE ENDED UP BEING TOGETHER
FOR, LIKE,

165
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,827
FOUR YEARS AFTER THAT.

166
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,995

00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,380
AND YOU WHISK IT, AND YOU
MAKE A CHOCOLATE GANACHE.

343
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,415
- GOES RIGHT TO MY ASS.

344
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,582
- THAT'S WHAT WE SERVE

345
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,051
AT THE, UH--
[laughs]

346
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:33,887
TAKE YOUR SPATULA OUT.
PUT YOUR SUGAR IN.

347
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,588
- WAIT, I CAN PUT ALL OF IT,
RIGHT?

348
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,324
- [belches]
OOPS.

349
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:38,425
[laughter]
- OKAY.

350
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,659
[laughter]

351
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,628
- PEOPLE JUST HAVE TO
GET USED TO ME.

352
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,296
SORRY.

353
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:44,998
- OKAY, WE CAN MIX.

354
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,399
- WHY ARE YOU BAKING?

355
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,301
DO YOU HAVE
SOMEONE TO IMPRESS?

356
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,037
- UH, YEAH, I DO,
ACTUALLY.

357
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,238
- OKAY, MORE MILK.

358
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,240
- REALLY?

359
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,209
- MY BOYFRIEND, HIS PARENTS
ARE PROFESSIONAL BAKERS.

360
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,411
- UHH!
WHAT A BURDEN.

361
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:01,448
MY PARTNER'S NAME IS ASHLEY,
AND SHE'S ACTUALLY REALLY COOL.

362
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,516
LIKE, SHE'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
FROM ME AND NICOLE,

363
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,686
BUT SHE HAS A VERY SWEET SIDE
TO HER,

364
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,421
AND I COULD
JUST RELATE TO HER.

365
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,324
- WHOOP.
- [laughs]

366
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,093
- FLYING SPATULA.
- IT TOOK OFF.

367
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,361
- OKAY.

368
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:19,532
- I'M INTERESTED IN GOING TO,
UH, POWERHOUSE.

369
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,401
- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
REALLY COOL.

370
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:23,070
- WANT TO COME?
- YEAH.

371
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,571
- YEAH?
- I'LL GO.

372
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:26,206
- NICOLE HAS BEEN A BITCH
TO ME LATELY.

373
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:29,109
IF SHE WANTS TO SIT AROUND
AND BE MISERABLE,

374
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,743
SIT AROUND AND BE MISERABLE.

375
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:32,679
I'M NOT GONNA SIT AROUND
AND BE MISERABLE WITH YOU.

376
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:36,016
GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU.
BYE.

377

[upbeat music]

378
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:42,923
- * YOU CAN'T ALWAYS
HAVE EVERYTHING *

379
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,893
- YOU IN?
- HI.

380
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:49,129
HOW WAS COOKING CLASS?
- I MADE A FRIEND.

381
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,031
- A FRIEND?
- I INVITED HER.

382
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:52,665
- COOL.
- YOU'RE GONNA LIKE HER.

383
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,902
ASHLEY.

384
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,904
- WHY ARE YOU INVITING
THE WHOLE WORLD?

385
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,005
I JUST WANT TO GO TO DINNER
WITH YOU.

386
00:13:58,005 --> 00:14:01,341
[playful music]

387
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,710
HOW ARE WE GETTING THERE?
- TAKE A CAB.

388
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,612
- YOUR NEW FRIEND'S
NOT PICKING US UP?

389
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:08,916
- [bleep] ME. WHY ARE YOU
SUCH A HATER?

390
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,118
- WHY ARE YOU SO SCARED
OF DINNER WITH ME ALONE?

391
00:14:11,118 --> 00:14:12,585
I WASN'T SURE WE WERE
INVITING FRIENDS.

392
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,987
I WOULD HAVE INVITED FRIENDS.

393
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,155
- WHAT FRIENDS DO YOU HAVE
OUT HERE?

394
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,223
'CAUSE I HAVE NONE.

395
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:17,157
- I WOULD HAVE MADE ONE
ON THE STREET

396
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,591
WHEN YOU WERE GONE.

397
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,327
- I MEAN, IT'S REALLY
NOT MY FAULT THAT I MET SOMEONE

398
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,661
THAT'S A GENUINELY
NICE PERSON,

399
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,730
AND I'M SURE NICOLE
WILL GET OVER IT.

400
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,067
- JENNI, CABS ARE HERE.

401
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,003
[upbeat music]

402
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,105
* *

403
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,974
- DRINK YOUR PELLIGRINO.

404
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,943
- NO, I HAD TOO MUCH
CARBS TODAY.

405
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:37,677
- [laughs]
CARBONATED.

406
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,579
[laughter]

408
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,652
I WANT TO FEEL LIKE
I'M ON A TROPICAL ISLAND.

409
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,154
- YOU WANT ME TO PUT THIS DOWN
OVER HERE?

410
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,956
- YEAH!

411
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:50,457
HI!

412
00:14:50,457 --> 00:14:52,259
- IS THAT YOUR FRIEND?

413
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:54,627
- THIS IS NICOLE.
- HI.

414
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,530
- SHE'S MAD.
- WHAT? I'M NOT MAD.

415
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,532
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE JENNI
MY BITCH,

416
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:02,002
BUT I WANT HER TO
WANT TO HANG OUT WITH ME

417
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,971
INSTEAD OF INVITING STRANGERS.

418
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:05,572
- HER MAN'S FROM AUSTRIA.

419
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,774
- YEAH, HE'S FOREIGN.
- NICE.

420
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:11,979
- WE'RE GONNA MAKE HIM
TRY AND PROPOSE TO HER.

421
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,413
SHE JUST GOT PROPOSED.

422
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,715
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
CONGRATULATIONS.

423
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:16,783
- THANKS.
- THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL RING.

424
00:15:16,783 --> 00:15:18,818
- YES, IT'S RIDICULOUS.

425
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,754
- SHE'S ACTUALLY A REALLY,
REALLY NICE CHICK,

426
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,091
UM, BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M STILL
GIVING JENNI [bleep]

427
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,858
BECAUSE I LIKE TO BUST
HER BALLS.

428
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,861
- SO, THIS IS YOUR FIRST NIGHT
OUT? IN THE BIG JC?

429
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:30,130
- ISH.

430
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,331
- I WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT
THE FIRST NIGHT OUT.

431
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,599
- WE HAVEN'T BEEN TO A CLUB.

432
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,134
- YEAH, WE HAVEN'T BEEN
TO A CLUB.

433
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,535
- WELL, THERE'S, LIKE,
NONE AROUND HERE.

434
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,104
THAT'S PROBABLY
YOUR PROBLEM.

435
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,406
- THAT GUY TO YOUR LEFT
HAS BEEN CREEPING ME OUT.

436
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,013
- WHOA!
[laughter]

437
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,248
EMBARRASSING.

438
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,252
- OH, MY GOD, HE'S STARING.

439
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:54,354
ASHLEY, TAKE A LOOK.

440
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:57,024
- I CAN'T.
I DON'T WANT TO, REALLY.

441
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:00,593
[overlapping chatter]

442
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,429
- WHAT DID THAT GUY
SAY TO YOU?

443
00:16:02,429 --> 00:16:03,930
- HE SAID,
HE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

444
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,598
IF HE COULD BUY YOU GUYS
A DRINK?

445
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,434
- NO.
EW!

446
00:16:07,434 --> 00:16:08,935
IF THIS GUY
BUYS US DRINKS,

447
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:10,370
HE COULD PROBABLY
SLIP US ROOFIES,

448
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,506
AND I'M PREGNANT, AND I
DON'T DO THAT ANYMORE.

449
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,907
WELL, NOT LIKE
I EVER DID THAT,

450
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,543
BUT THAT'S GROSS.

451
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,245
DO YOU WANT SOMETHING?

452
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,580
YOU'VE BEEN STARING AT US
FOR AN HOUR.

453
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,050
- NOT STARING.
- IT'S AWKWARD.

454
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,117
YOU'VE BEEN LIKE THIS
THE WHOLE TIME.

455
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,385
- STOP IT.

456
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:26,719
- YOU'RE CREEPING US OUT.
- REALLY?

457
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,356
- SO CREEPY.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

458
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:31,324
I'M SCARED OF
THE CREEPY PEOPLE,

459
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,060
BUT I'M NOT SCARED,
BECAUSE I HAVE JENNI.

460
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,327
- THANKS.

461
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:36,296
- AND JENNI WOULD
[bleep] KILL HIM, SO--

462
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:37,630
YOU WOULD KILL HIM.

463
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,532
- IF I HAD TO, YEAH.
- YEAH, SO--

464
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:42,769
- I'D STAB HIM IN THE EYE.
- I GOT MY BODYGUARD. [laughs]

465
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,604
- IF HE'S OUTSIDE OF
OUR HOUSE WHEN WE GET THERE--

466
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,506
- I FEEL LIKE HE'S GONNA
GRAB ONTO OUR BUMPER

467
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,774
AND COME WITH US.

468
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,077
- HE PROBABLY COULD SKATE
ON THAT THING.

469
00:16:50,077 --> 00:16:52,945
- GOD. GO FAST.
WE HAVE A STALKER.

470
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:54,714
[laughter]

471
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,786
- THERE'S MORE
SNOOKI &amp; JWOWW ON THE WAY,

472
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:02,755
AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

473
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,658
[upbeat music]

474
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,194
[phone rings]

475
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,262

00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:17,104
[ringing]

477
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,277
- HOW ARE YA?

478
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:27,280
- UM, DO YOU HAVE
A LITTLE TIME?

479
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,916
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH, I'M OKAY.

480
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,985
UH, I DON'T KNOW
IF WE'RE OKAY, BUT--

481
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,554
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

482
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,824
- UM, LISTEN, I--I DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT THIS.

483
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:40,560
UH, I JUST HEARD SOME STUFF,
YOU KNOW,

484
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,763
ON THE RADIO THIS MORNING,
AND THEN I CALLED YOUR DAD

485
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:47,134
AND GOT COMPLETELY [bleep]
AND LIED TO BY HIM.

486
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,902
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

487
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,638
- OKAY, ARE YOU GONNA CONTINUE
TO LIE TO ME, OR--?

488
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,173
- NO, I'M NOT.

489
00:17:53,173 --> 00:17:55,175
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

490
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,709
- YET AGAIN,
YOU'RE LYING TO ME.

491
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:58,311
- I'M NOT LYING, ROGER.
WHAT ARE YOU TAL--?

492
00:17:58,311 --> 00:17:59,446
I CALLED YOU--

493
00:17:59,446 --> 00:18:01,148
- ALL YOU DO
IS LIE TO ME, JENNI.

494
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,615
THAT'S ALL YOU DO IS LIE TO ME.
- NO, I DON'T.

495
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,851
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

496
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,619
- YOU'RE BEING SUED
RIGHT NOW,

497
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,054
AND I LEARN ABOUT IT
ON THE [bleep] RADIO?

498
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,356
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

499
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,258
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
I'M BEING SUED RIGHT NOW?

500
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:12,759
- IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS.

501
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,294
I'M HEARING ABOUT IT
FROM EVERYBODY.

502
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:15,762
THIS IS
HOW I LEARNED ABOUT IT,

503
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,798
'CAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND
JUST LIES TO ME FOR YEARS NOW.

504
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,734
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING--
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW ANY OF THIS.

505
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,603
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY ROGER'S
ACTING THE WAY THAT HE IS,

506
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:27,307
AND I HAD NO IDEA I HAVE
A LAWSUIT AGAINST ME RIGHT NOW

507
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:29,342
THAT HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT
THAN I DO.

508
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,077
- I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CLEARER
I CAN PUT IT.

509
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,379
I KNEW YOU WERE EITHER GONNA GO
THE VICTIM ROUTE,

00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,446
WHICH YOU LOVE TO DO.

511
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,647
- I'M NOT GOING
THE VICTIM ROUTE.

512
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,683
TO BE HONEST,
I'M A LITTLE SIDESTEPPED,

513
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:38,185
BECAUSE I HONESTLY THOUGHT,
LIKE,

514
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:40,887
YOU THOUGHT I CHEATED ON YOU
OR YOU CHEATED ON ME.

515
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:42,855
LIKE, THAT'S HOW THE [bleep]
CONVERSATION GOT STARTED.

516
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,292
- NO, IT'S ABOUT LYING IS WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT, ONCE AGAIN,

517
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,293
AND YOU CLAIM THAT
I NEED TO GET OVER--

518
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:47,994
- NO!

519
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:50,630
- I NEED TO GET OVER THE PAST
BECAUSE YOU'RE A NEW PERSON,

520
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,799
AND ALL THOSE LIES
THAT YOU USED TO TELL ME

521
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,000
IS NO LONGER YOU.

522
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,435
AND UNLIKE YOU,
I NEVER LIE.

523
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,036
I NEVER LIED TO YOU ONCE,
EVER.

524
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,272
- ROGER'S MAD AT THE FACT
THAT I LIE.

525
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,441
I LIE ABOUT STUPID [bleep]
ALL THE TIME,

526
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:04,644
BUT I LOOK AT, LIKE,
STUPID LIES AND, LIKE, BIG LIES.

527
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,813
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE THIS
IS A STUPID LIE

528
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,681
THAT HE'S TAKING
WAY TOO FAR.

529
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,049
- FOR ONCE IN YOUR [bleep]DAMN
LIFE, STOP LYING!

530
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,351
- MM-MM.

531
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,753
- DO YOU THINK THIS IS
A FAIR RELATIONSHIP, JENNI?

532
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,323
- IT IS FAIR, BUT ROGER,
I JUST WOKE UP.

533
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,524
- WAIT A MINUTE, YOU LET ME
FINISH.

534
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,058
YOU LET ME FINISH.
YOU LET ME FINISH.

535
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,893
YOU THINK THIS IS
A FAIR RELATIONSHIP

536
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:24,531
THAT I AM NOTHING BUT BRUTALLY,
BRUTALLY HONEST WITH YOU?

537
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,698
NOT ONLY THAT,

538
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,866
I'VE LIVED THROUGH HELL
WITH, YOU KNOW,

539
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,668
ACCUSATIONS
AND EVERYTHING ELSE WITH YOU,

540
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,237
PROVED THEM ALL WRONG.

541
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,671
I'VE ALWAYS COME OUT
ON TOP.

542
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:35,475
- TRUST IS DEFINITELY THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING TO ROGER

543
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:39,512
AND NOT LYING,

544
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,283
SO HE [bleep] UP
BY DATING ME.

545
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:46,253
- DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR THAT
YOU JUST CONSTANTLY [bleep] ME

546
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,420
AND LIE TO ME?

547
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,589
- I DON'T [bleep]
AND LIE TO YOU, ROGER.

548
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:50,890
- ALL YOU DO IS LIE.

549
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,459
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

550
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:53,893
YOU LISTEN TO ME.
STOP!

551
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,628
SHUT UP FOR
FIVE [bleep] SECONDS!

552
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,163
- CALM DOWN!
- JESUS [bleep]!

553
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,999
YOU'RE REALLY [bleep]
PISSING ME OFF RIGHT NOW!

554
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,168
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THIS!

555
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,836
I SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THE [bleep] LAWSUIT!

556
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,505
- YOU COULD DEFEND YOURSELF
BY TELLING ME

557
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:07,073
THAT YOU [bleep] LIED TO ME.

558
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:09,376

THE [bleep] TRUTH!

559
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,278
- WOW.

560
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,312
WOW.

561
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:13,846
JUST DON'T LIE.
JUST DON'T LIE.

562
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:14,947
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
DON'T LIE.

563
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,416
ESPECIALLY TO SOMEBODY
YOU LOVE.

564
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,885
- I DON'T KNOW NOW.
I DON'T KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

565
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,187
- JENNI, I CAN'T LIVE WITH THIS
[bleep] LYING ANYMORE.

566
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:23,523
- NO.

567
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,892
I AM [bleep], LIKE,
COMPLETELY...

00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,327
[groans]

569
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:31,030
- I CAN GIVE YOU ALL
THE FACE TIME YOU NEED.

570
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,999
- WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW?

571
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,404
- IS HE COMING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

572
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:38,738
HE SAID HE IS.
I DON'T CARE.

573
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,507
ACTUALLY, I DON'T
WANT HIM TO COME.

574
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,642
[door slams and locks]

575
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,176
- HAVING A BABY IS GONNA BE

576
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:46,746
THE MOST LIFE-ALTERING
EXPERIENCE YOU'VE EVER HAD.

577
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,947
- I'VE GOT GREAT EXPERIENCE.

578
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,349
THREE OF MY SIBLINGS
HAVE BABIES.

579
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,750
- I DON'T THINK
THAT MEANS THAT YOU KNOW

580
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,218
EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW
ABOUT CHILD-REARING.

581
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,420
- TRUST ME, I DO.

582
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,087
- THAT'S AN EXTREMELY
NAIVE STATEMENT.
