[doorbell]

00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,044
- POOP!

3
00:00:10,044 --> 00:00:12,480
- HI.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,647
HOW'S YOUR BABY?

5
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:15,083
- IT'S YOUR BABY.
- OH.

6
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,450
IT'S NOT A BABY.

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,885
I RESPECT
AND I THINK IT'S AWESOME

8
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:19,853
THAT SHE'S INTO IT LIKE THAT,

9
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,189
BUT...IT'S A DOLL.

10
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:22,990
YOU HUNGRY?

11
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,425
CAN I BUY YOU SOMETHING?

12
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,959
CAN I BUY YOU DINNER?

13
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,261
- WE'RE GOING TO DINNER
TONIGHT.

14
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,929
- OH.

15
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,431
- CAN YOU HOLD HIM REAL QUICK?
- COME ON.

16
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,732
- I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
I'M NOT KIDDING.

17
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,867
- OH, MY GOD.

18
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,569
- DON'T HOLD IT LIKE THAT!

19
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:43,511
[doll crying]

20
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,379
JIONNI!
- WHAT?

21
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,115
- YOU LEFT THE BABY CRYING?

22
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,849
- OH, HE'S CRYING?

23
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,951
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
YOUR FEET UP.

24
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,620
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

25
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,787
- YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE
OF THE BABY.

26
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:55,022
- SO ARE YOU!

27
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,524
THE ONLY REASON
WHY I'M NOT MAD AT JIONNI

28
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,592
IS BECAUSE I KNOW,
WHEN WE HAVE OUR CHILD,

29
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:03,131
JIONNI IS GOING TO BE
THE GREATEST FATHER EVER.

30
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:04,532
HE'S GONNA CHOKE.

31
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:07,168
- HE'S EATING CARROTS
WITH HIS DAD.

32
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,043
- WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?
- WHAT'S UP, ROG?

33
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:18,146
- WHERE ARE WE GOING TO EAT
AND WHAT TIME?

34
00:01:18,146 --> 00:01:20,881
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

35
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:22,250
BAR MAJESTIC
IS SUPPOSED TO BE COOL.

36
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,485
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
AN OLD THEATER.

37
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:26,220
- I'M VERY IMPRESSED
WITH YOUR GIRL.

38
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,156
- IT'S A DOLL, ROG.

39
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:29,457
- BUT YOUR GIRL'S
TAKING IT SERIOUSLY,

40
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:30,991
YOU SHOULD TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

41
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:32,393
- OKAY, WELL, THIS IS MY KID.
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT?

42
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,994
- YOU'RE THE UNCLE.
- YEAH, I'LL HOLD THE KID.

43
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,329
- AW.
- IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

44
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,864
NOT EVEN GONNA DRINK
WHILE I'M HOLDING THIS KID.

45
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:40,168
I FEEL LIKE I'M HOLDING JIONNI
WHEN HE'S DRUNK.

46
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:41,735
- BRO, YOU'RE DOING GOOD
WITH IT.

47
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,271
- I'M GONNA BE
A GREAT DAD, DUDE.

48
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:44,738
AS SOON AS I FIND
THE RIGHT WOMAN,

49
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:45,906
I'M GONNA BE A GREAT FATHER.

50
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,408
[laughs]

51
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:49,177
- SHE DIDN'T HEAR YA.

52
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:51,445
- ALL RIGHT, DO YOU WANT
YOUR BABY BACK?

53
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,682
- NOT YET.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "NOT YET"?

54
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:57,718
- YOU CAN GIVE IT BACK.
- I GAVE YOU A BREAK.

55
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,987
ASK ME IF I WANTED TO HOLD IT.

56
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:01,622
[doll screaming]
- JENNI!

57
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,624
- MY BABY!
- HOW'S IT FEEL?

58
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:08,196
SORRY ABOUT THE KID.
- I DON'T MIND ME.

59
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:10,431
- GIVE ME MY BABY.
[doll screams]

60
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,971
- IT'S QUIET.
- IT'S ROMANTIC.

61
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,208
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA GET?
- CHICKEN.

62
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,043
- WHAT ARE YOU GETTING?

63
00:02:23,043 --> 00:02:26,013
- I WAS GONNA GET
WHAT YOU GOT, BUT--

64
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,482
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU DON'T LIKE ANYTHING.

65
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,219
- I'M JUST A BITCH RIGHT NOW.

66
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,321
- SHE'S JOKING.

67
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:36,357
- SHOULD BE, UH--
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN.

68
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,559
- NOT LIKE THIS, WE'RE NOT.
- YEAH, WE ARE.

69
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:41,362
- NICOLE, DO YOU WANNA TELL THEM
WHY WE BROUGHT 'EM HERE?

70
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:43,631
- THERE'S A KICKER
TO THIS DINNER?

71
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:46,133
- IS THERE A REAL REASON
WE'RE HERE?

72
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,668
- YES.
- WHAT IS IT?

73
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:51,405
- ME AND JENNI DECIDED...

74
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,973
- [pained sigh]

75
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:56,510
- THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE OUT
OF THE HOUSE.

76
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,246
- TO WHERE?

77
00:02:58,246 --> 00:03:01,815
- I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE IN
WITH YOU.

78
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:04,585
- ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS?
YOU'RE MOVING BACK HOME?

79
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,019
- I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE
BACK HOME.

80
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,421
- WHAT HAPPENED?

81
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,089
- JUST THE FACT THAT SHE'S
IN HER SECOND TRIMESTER

82
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,992
AND SHE WANTS TO--
- I NEED TO BE WITH YOU.

83
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:14,262
- AND OBVIOUSLY OUR RELATIONSHIP
ISN'T WORKING HERE.

84
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:17,130
- YOU WANT TO MOVE IN WITH ME?
- YES, I DO.

85
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,132
- JIONNI WAS LIKE,
"YES, OF COURSE."

86
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,568
- AND ROGER LOOKED LIKE

87
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:22,770
HE COULD'VE CARED
TWO [bleep] [bleep].

88
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,338
LIKE, WHATEVER.
- COOL.

89
00:03:24,338 --> 00:03:26,540
- YO, I HAVE AN IDEA.

90
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,841
I'LL BUY YOU
ALL YOUR DRINKS TONIGHT--

91
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,677
ANYTHING YOU WANT--

92
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:32,280
IF YOU CAN EAT A TABLESPOON
OF CINNAMON.

93
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,582
YOU SWALLOW IT,
AND YOU WIN.

94
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:36,116
WILL YOU DO IT OR NO?

95
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:37,651
- I GUESS SO.

96
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:41,289
- COULD I GET A TABLESPOON
AND A LITTLE THING OF CINNAMON?

97
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,591
- OKAY.

98
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:47,194
- I'M BUILDING UP MY SALIVA.

99
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,562
- WHAT'S THAT?

100
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,431
PREPPING?
- YEP.

101
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,566
- THAT'S ACTUAL, REAL,
LEGIT CINNAMON? OKAY.

102
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,034
- AM I GONNA THROW UP
OR SOMETHING?

103
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:55,303
- NO.

104
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:58,105
- HOLD THIS,
DO NOT SPILL ANY.

105
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:03,677
YOU'RE SWALLOWING CINNAMON, BRO.
JUST CINNAMON.

106
00:04:03,677 --> 00:04:07,080
- I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA BE
BUYING DRINKS.

107
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,851
- SWA--SWALLOW IT.

108
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,520
SWA--SWALLOW IT.

109
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,822
SWALLOW IT.
NO, YOU CAN'T DRINK.

110

BABE!

112

- HE'S THROWING UP!
HE'S THROWING UP!

113
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,833
- HE'S AN IDIOT.

114
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,535
- HE'S SO CUTE.
[laughter]

115
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:31,439
- IS THIS A [bleep] BABY?

116
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,341
- I HOPE NICOLE TAKES THIS
ALL SERIOUS.

[doll crying]

118
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,345
- OH, MY GOD.

119
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,246
- WHY DON'T YOU LIE BACK?
- [burps]

120
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,614
TODAY IS MY APPOINTMENT,
AND I'M VERY EXCITED

121
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,451
BECAUSE I'M GONNA ASK THE DOCTOR
IF HE CAN TELL THE SEX.

122
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:45,453
CAN YOU SEE?
- IT LOOKS LIKE A BOY.

123
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,655
- * I DON'T CARE *

124

00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,610
DO YOU HAVE PREGNANT CLASSES?

134
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,413
I HAVEN'T REALLY READ
MY PREGNANCY BOOK AT ALL.

135
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,782
I'D RATHER TALK
TO ACTUAL PREGNANT WOMEN

136
00:05:14,782 --> 00:05:16,384
THAN ACTUALLY READING

137
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,386
BECAUSE IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW...
READING.

138
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:20,821
- ACTUALLY,
WE HAVE ONE TONIGHT.

139
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,790
IT'S AN INTRODUCTION
TO THE BIRTH PROCESS.

- WHAT TIME?
- 7:30 SHARP.

141
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,761
- UM, OKAY,

00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,398
- CONGRATULATIONS!

143
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:32,065
UM, DO YOU HAVE HOMEWORK?

144
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,434
- NOT PER SE.

145
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:37,170
I MEAN, YOUR HOMEWORK
IS IN YOUR BELLY.

146
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,606
- HUH?

147
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:41,041
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

WILL YOU GO TO A PREGNANT CLASS

151
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,184
- MM-HMM.

152
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,621
I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE
IN THIS BIRTHING CLASS

153
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:56,123
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA LEARN A LOT MORE

154
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,626
FROM PREGNANT WOMEN
THAN DOCTORS OR, YOU KNOW,

155
00:05:58,626 --> 00:05:59,993
ANYBODY ELSE.

156
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,463
- MAYBE I'LL BRING THE DOGS.
- OH, DEAR.

157
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,432
AND BABIES?

158
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:12,005
HELLO.

[indistinct chatter]

160
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,443
- I'M NICOLE.
- JENNI.

161
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:16,710
- I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

162
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,078
[light laughter]

163
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,448
THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS LIKE.

164
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:23,116
- WELL, PEOPLE DON'T USUALLY
BRING THEIR BABIES TO THE CLASS,

165
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,853
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY.
- I'M PRACTICING.

166
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:28,456
- UM, OUR TOPIC TONIGHT
IS GOING TO BE

167
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:31,291
EXPLORING PREGNANCY
AND BIRTH MYTHS.

00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,660
LET'S START OVER HERE.

169
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,128
- I'M NICOLE,
AND THIS IS MY FIRST CHILD.

170
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,730
UNEXPECTED,
BUT I'M VERY HAPPY.

171
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,700
SO I REALLY KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON.

172
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,069
BUT I'M REALLY NERVOUS
ABOUT MY VAGINA RIPPING

173
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,137
TO MY ASS[bleep]
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

174
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,473
- OH, MY GOD.

175
00:06:45,473 --> 00:06:47,741
- RIGHT?
YEAH.

176
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,477
- EVERYBODY'S WORRIED
ABOUT THAT.

177
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:52,646
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THIS DELICATE AREA--

178
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,748
OKAY, THAT'S NOT REALLY--
- IS THAT THE BUTT?

179
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,383
- THE ANAL SPHINCTER, YES.

180
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,486
SOMETIMES, A DOCTOR
WILL DO A CUT,

181
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,488
CALLED AN EPISIOTOMY.

182
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:02,322
- THAT REALLY SCARES ME
ABOUT GIVING BIRTH.

183
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,492
THAT [bleep] IS NASTY,
AND I'LL [bleep] THROW UP.

184
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:06,794
- THIS IS WHAT YOUR PELVIS
LOOKS LIKE.

185
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:09,730
AND THE BABY IS GOING TO HAVE
TO MAKE A JOURNEY,

186
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:15,002
AND THEN KIND OF TURNING
A LITTLE BIT IN ITS WAY.

187
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:16,504
- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE HER
NOT WANNA HAVE KIDS.

188
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,905
- I KNOW.

189
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,673
- SO THEN ONCE IT
EXITS THE PELVIS,

190
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,710
IT'S IN THE VAGINAL CANAL,

191
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,311
AND THE BABY
COMES OUT FULLY

192
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:28,381
WITHOUT HAVING INJURED YOU.

193
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:32,019
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT TAKES
FOR SOMEBODY TO GIVE BIRTH?

194
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,523
- I, TECHNICALLY, I THINK,
WAS IN LABOR FOR 17 HOURS.

195
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:37,190
- DOES IT FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE POOPING?

196
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,391
- YES, IT DOES.

197
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,827
THEY TRY TO TELL YOU
THAT IT DOESN'T

198
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,129
BECAUSE I THINK THEY DON'T
WANT THE ASSOCIATION

199
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,031
OF, LIKE,
"OH, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BABY,"

200
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,366
NOT A CRAP.

201
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,668
BUT IT'S EXACTLY LIKE POOPING.

202
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:48,836
- YECH.

203
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,437
I LOVE POOPING.

204
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:52,439
I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY
THAT I HAVE TO POOP.

205
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,708
SO AS LONG AS I DON'T POOP
ON MY BABY DURING PREGNANCY,

206
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,909
IT'S FINE.

207
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,945
- THANKS AGAIN FOR COMING.
- THANK YOU.

208
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,279
- YEAH, THANK YOU.

209
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,549
OVERALL, I DEFINITELY ENJOYED
THE BIRTHING CLASS.

210
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:03,684
RIGHT NOW,
JENNI'S NEVER GONNA HAVE KIDS.

211
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,619
- I FEEL LIKE IT POSTPONED ME
A FEW MORE YEARS.

212
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:06,820
- IT DID.

213
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,355
- NOW I GOTTA GO PICK UP
MY REAL CHILDREN.

214
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,123
- THE DOGS.
- YEAH.

215
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,160
[pop music]

216
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,697
- * ALL THAT I ASK *

217
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:18,766
* ALL THAT I,
ALL THAT I *

218
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:21,902
* ALL THAT I ASK *

219
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,905
- YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
MY CHICKEN TAPAS.

220
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,574
I MISS COOKING FOR ROGER.

221
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:28,308
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S COOL?

222
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:33,213
LIVING HERE, I GREW UP,
AND, LIKE, YOU LET LOOSE.

223
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:37,751
- I STILL FEEL LIKE ROGER'S,
LIKE, NOT HAPPY THAT I'M HERE.

224
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:40,353
- I MISS SLEEPING WITH JIONNI.

225
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,356
THE MORE PREGNANT I GET,
THE MORE I FEEL I SHOULD REALLY

226
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,894
BE EXPERIENCING THIS
WITH JIONNI INSTEAD OF JENNI.

227
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:50,631
- I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE WE
MOVED IN TOGETHER, TO BE HONEST.

228
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,866
- I DON'T THINK
WE WERE THINKING.

229
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:56,069
- YEAH, WE DO THAT A LOT.
- WE WENT OFF INSTINCT.

230
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,405
- WE HAVE A HABIT
OF DOING THAT A LOT THOUGH.

231
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,207
- I NEVER THINK.
ARE YOU KIDDING?

232
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,609
- ME NEITHER.

233
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,276
- WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M PREGNANT?

234
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,878
SO, YOU KNOW, JUST RIGHT NOW,
I'M KINDA CONFUSED

235
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,214
AS TO WHAT I WANNA DO.

236
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,616
I DON'T KNOW.

237
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:11,418
I KINDA FEEL LIKE I NEED
TO BE WITH JIONNI.

238
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,986
I MEAN, WE'RE NEWLY ENGAGED,

239
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,822
AND I HAVEN'T REALLY
SEEN HIM AT ALL.

240
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:18,626
SO I THINK WE BOTH HAVE SOME
[bleep] WE NEED TO DEAL WITH.

241
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:20,628
- ARE YOU REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT MOVING?

242
00:09:20,628 --> 00:09:23,363
OR IS THIS JUST LIKE ANOTHER
CONVERSATION WE ALWAYS HAVE?

243
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,765
- MOVING OUT?
- MM-HMM.

244
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:27,067
- YEAH.

245
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,637
- LIKE, SOON?
- LIKE, SOON.

246
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,071
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE GUYS ARE GONNA SAY

247
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,073
WHEN WE TELL THEM THAT WE DON'T
WANNA LIVE TOGETHER ANYMORE?

248
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,342
- WELL, THEY'RE EITHER
GONNA BE REALLY HAPPY

249
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,377
AND BE LIKE, "OH, YAY,
OUR GIRLS ARE COMING HOME,"

250
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,746
OR THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE,
"OH, [bleep].

251
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,048
I KINDA LIKED BEING ALONE,"
BECAUSE THEY ARE GUYS.

252
00:09:41,048 --> 00:09:42,549
- I'M AFRAID.

253
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,852
- ME TOO.

254
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:46,820
- I'M HURT.
SHE HURTS ME.

255
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,356
SHE DOES THESE THINGS
THAT I WOULD NEVER DO TO HER.

256
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:52,125
AND YOU JUST SEE IT--
KINDA ONE SIDE OF THIS

257
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,094
BECAUSE AFTER THAT PHONE
GETS HUNG UP,

258
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,328
THEN YOU SEE
YOUR BEST FRIEND GOING

259
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,864
AND LAY DOWN
AND START CRYING.

260
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,234
- YOU LOOK REALLY COOL TODAY.

261
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,003
- OH.
- YOU LOOK LIKE ME.

262
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:04,237
BUT BIGGER BOOBS.

263
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,039
YOU READY?

264
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,177
I FEEL LIKE I'M DRIVING...

265
00:10:10,177 --> 00:10:11,779
- A MONSTER TRUCK?
- AN 18-WHEELER.

266
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,687
- SORRY FOR LAST NIGHT.
THE AWKWARDNESS.

267
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:21,922
- I THINK YOU NEED WORK.
- IT'S NOT WORK.

268
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,590
IT'S JUST, LIKE,
CUTTING THE BULL[bleep] OUT.

269
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,326
- I MEAN, THEY EITHER NEED
TO RESOLVE THEIR ISSUES,

270
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,361
OR THEY JUST NEED
TO LET IT GO.

271
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:29,963
- OR BREAK UP.

272
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,765
- THAT'S WHAT I MEANT
BY "LET GO."

273
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,133
- OH.

274
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,467
- IT'S NOT EVEN YOU
THAT NEEDS TO WORK ON,

275
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,836
IT'S HIM TOO.

276
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,705
AND I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS
IT'S HIM TOO.

277
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:41,141
- I NEED SOMEONE ELSE
TO SHOW, LIKE...

278
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,443
OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE.

279
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:45,679
- I'LL [bleep] TELL HIM.

280
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,348
- SHOULD WE GO SEE HIM?
- I THINK WE SHOULD DO A DATE.

281
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,583
LIKE, I'LL CALL JIONNI
AND SAY, "LET'S DO A DATE.

282
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,985
MEET ME HERE."

283
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,220
AND THEN YOU DO THE SAME
FOR ROGER,

284
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,521
AND THEN WE'LL JUST SWITCH.

285
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:55,989
AND THEN, LIKE,
ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE

286
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,725
THAT YOU WANT ME TO ASK HIM--

287
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:58,859
THEN YOU CAN DO
THE SAME WITH JIONNI

288
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,127
'CAUSE I HAVE QUESTIONS TOO.

289
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,764
- INTERVENTION/21 QUESTIONS?

290
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:05,799
- YEAH.
- I HOPE ROGER AGREES.

291
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:08,535
- AND THEN I'LL SHOW UP,
AND HE'LL BE LIKE, "COOL."

292
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,737
[both laugh]

293
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:11,739
[line trilling]

294
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,240
POOP?
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

295
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,942
- NOTHING,
I WAS JUST CALLING

296
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:17,410
AND SEEING IF YOU WANTED
TO GO TO DINNER AT 9:30.

297
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,946
[line trilling]

298
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,313
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

299
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,282
- I WOULD LIKE TO DO DINNER
WITH YOU ONE LAST TIME.

300
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,217
- MEET ME AT HARD GROVE CAFE.

301
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,319
- THERE'S THIS PLACE
CALLED MERCHANT.

302
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,487
- OKAY.

303
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,488
- OKAY, SO I'LL SEE YOU THERE
AT 9:30.

304
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,857
- ALL RIGHT, BABE.
SEE YOU AT 9:30.

305
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,024
- ALL RIGHT, LOVE YOU.

306
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,493
- OKAY, LOVE YOU.

307
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,763
[dial tone]
- [bleep].

308
00:11:35,763 --> 00:11:37,130
IT'S ACTUALLY
A PRETTY GOOD PLAN.

309
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,499
- I'M GONNA BARBARA WALTERS
THAT [bleep].

310
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,802
- MM.
I LOVE BARBARA.

311
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,171
YOU LOOK LIKE BARBARA RIGHT NOW.
- THANKS.

312
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:47,540
GOOD LUCK WITH JIONNI.

313
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,909
- GOOD LUCK WITH ROGER.

314
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,211
- TELL HIM I LOVE HIM.
- I WILL.

315
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,512
- IF IT'S GOOD.

316
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:53,847
IF IT'S BAD,
TELL HIM TO [bleep] OFF.

317
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,917

* *

319
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,566
- FEEL AWKWARD?
- WHAT'S UP?

320
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,402
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M YOUR DATE TONIGHT.

321
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,238
- OH, YEAH?

322
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,807
- UGH.

323
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:22,609
SO I'M BASICALLY HERE...
- [clears throat]

324
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,312
- FOR NICOLE.
- OKAY.

325
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:26,880
- 'CAUSE I HAVE QUESTIONS.
- ALL RIGHT.

326
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,548
SHOULD I BE EXCITED
OR NERVOUS?

327
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,151
- BE EXCITED.
I WANNA GET TO KNOW YOU.

328
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,820
- ALL RIGHT.

329
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,956
UH-OH.
ARE THESE THE LIST OF QUESTIONS?

330
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,825
ASK AWAY.
- [chuckles]

331
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:39,159
I THINK WE'LL NEED
A DRINK FIRST.

332
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:41,194
- MIGHT AS WELL
GET TWO DRINKS.

333
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,595
- I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS
RIGHT NOW.

334
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,064
YOU KNOW, IT'S
A LITTLE NERVE-WRACKING

335
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,498
SEEING JENNI ACROSS THE TABLE.

336
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,867
SHE'S ABOUT 2 FEET
TALLER THAN ME.

337
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:49,036
AND, LIKE, THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME THAT JENNI AND I

338
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,271
ACTUALLY SAT DOWN AND TALKED
TO EACH OTHER LIKE THIS.

339
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,476
- HEY, ROG!
- OH! WHOA.

340
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,744
- I'M YOUR DATE.

341
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,212
- I WAS GONNA SAY,
LIKE, "WHAT'S GOING ON?"

342
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:01,148
WHERE'S JENNI?
ARE YOU JOINING US?

343
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:02,515
- NO, YOU'RE NOT HAVING

344
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,417
A BIG-BREASTED GIRLFRIEND
FOR DINNER.

345
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,953
[Roger laughing]
IT'S JUST ME.

346
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,054
- OH, REALLY?

347
00:13:07,054 --> 00:13:08,655
THIS IS GONNA BE
INTERROGATION,

348
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,223
BUT I KINDA WELCOMED IT,
YOU KNOW,

349
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:11,859
'CAUSE IT'S A SIDE OF ME NICOLE
REALLY HAS NEVER GOT TO SEE.

350
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,760
- HOW COME YOU GUYS
FIGHT SO MUCH,

351
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,228
LIKE, OVER THE LITTLEST THINGS,

352
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:18,531
AND THEN IT TURNS OUT TO BE
FIGHTING ABOUT THE SAME [bleep]

353
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,100
OVER AND OVER?

354
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,369
- IT'S THE SAME COUPLE OF THINGS
THAT WE'VE FOUGHT ABOUT

355
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:23,871
FROM DAY ONE.

356
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:26,339
IT'S THE INSECURITIES
AND THE MISTRUST AND THE LYING.

357
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,607
IT'S REALLY
THOSE THREE THINGS.

358
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,042
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

359
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,743
MAYBE SHE COULD BE A LITTLE
MORE OPEN TO [bleep] SEX.

360
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,979
BUT OTHER THAN THAT,
THAT'S IT.

361
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,446
- [giggling]
EW.

362
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:36,749
- DO YOU THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL
WAS SOONER THAN EXPECTED

363
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,151
BECAUSE NICOLE WAS PREGNANT?

364
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,987
- OF COURSE,
IT WAS DEFINITELY SOONER.

365
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:41,521
BUT YOU KNOW,
SHE'S GOING THROUGH A LOT--

366
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,689
HAVING A BABY.

367
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:44,391
I THOUGHT SHE'D BE
VERY COMFORTABLE

368
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:47,895
WITH A RING ON HER FINGER,
KNOWING THAT I'M GONNA BE THERE.

369
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,529
- I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING
THIS DINNER

370
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,898
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GUYS
WERE FIGHTING,

371
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:52,900
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
JUST BEING SO MEAN TO HER.

372
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,235
- MM-HMM. I KNOW.
I'VE HEARD YOU SAY IT BEFORE.

373
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,905
"WHY DOES HE SAY THOSE THINGS?
WHY IS HE SO MEAN TO HER?"

374
00:13:57,905 --> 00:13:59,139
AND I AM MEAN,

375
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,908
BUT THERE'S A REASON BEHIND IT.
I'M HURT.

376
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,409
SHE HURTS ME

377
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:05,512
BECAUSE SHE DOES THESE THINGS
THAT I WOULD NEVER DO TO HER.

378
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:08,115
AND YOU JUST SEE IT--
KINDA ONE SIDE OF THIS,

379
00:14:08,115 --> 00:14:09,917
BECAUSE AFTER THAT PHONE
GETS HUNG UP,

380
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,218
THEN YOU SEE YOUR BEST FRIEND

381
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:12,685
GOING AND LAY DOWN
AND START CRYING.

382
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,756
BUT YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE HURT
AND THE PAIN THAT I FEEL.

383
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,458
- WHAT IF SHE WAS BROKE?

384
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,327
WHAT IF SHE WAS THREE YEARS AGO

385
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:21,661
WITH THE PIECE OF [bleep] CAR
THAT SHE HAD

386
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,764
AND NO MONEY, NOTHING?

387
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:26,133
HOW WOULD THAT BE?

388
00:14:26,133 --> 00:14:27,734
- I DON'T HAVE
A PRIVATE LIFE ANYMORE.

389
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,769
IF I DIDN'T LOVE HER, IT WOULD
MAKE NO SENSE TO BE WITH HER.

390
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,071
MAKE NO SENSE.

391
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,705
MONEY'S NOT WORTH
WHAT I HAVE BEEN THROUGH.

392
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:36,476
- I THINK JIONNI HANDLED
HIS INTERROGATION RATHER WELL.

393
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,411
HE WAS HONEST 'CAUSE
HE COULD'VE BULL[bleep] ME.

394
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,948
AND TO BE HONEST, YOU KNOW,
I DO WORRY ABOUT THEM,

395
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:43,550
BUT I KNOW HE'S GONNA BE
A GOOD DAD.

396
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,953
[both laughing]

397
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,587
- IT WAS A GOOD TALK.

398
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,056
- DO YOU THINK JENNI'S
YOUR SOUL MATE?

399
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:50,623
- I WANT HER TO BE.

400
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,159
I DON'T WANNA BE WITH ANYBODY
ELSE ON THE FACE OF THIS PLANET.

401
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,496
I WANNA BE WITH JENNI.
I LOVE JENNI.

402
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:58,565
YOU KNOW?

403
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:01,501
- I DON'T SEE THE [bleep]
BIG DEAL RIGHT NOW.

404
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,304
SO GOING INTO THIS,
I'M OBVIOUSLY TEAM JENNI.

405
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:06,739
BUT THEN AFTER TALKING
WITH ROGER,

406
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,310
I FEEL LIKE I UNDERSTAND ROGER
ON WHY HE ACTS THE WAY HE ACTS.

407
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:13,280
THIS IS RETARDED.
LIKE, YOU GUYS ARE [bleep] UP.

408
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,647
- [laughing]
I KNOW.

409
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,017
- I KINDA WANNA YELL AT JENNI
A LITTLE BIT.

410
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18,685
- DON'T DO THAT
'CAUSE SHE WILL FIGHT WITH YOU.

411
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,020
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA
YELL AT HER, NO.

412
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,556
IT'LL BE FINE,
HOPEFULLY.

413
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,397
- THERE'S MORE
SNOOKI AND JWOWW ON THE WAY,

414
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:33,000
AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

415
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,472
- BOO, I'M HOME.

416
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,774
- BOO, SOMEONE PEED.

417
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,211
- I'M NOT SURPRISED.

418
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,679
HOW WAS DINNER?
- HE HAD A LOT TO SAY.

419
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,415
- OH, NO.
I TOLD YOU.

420
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:50,017
- HOW WAS YOURS?

421
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,119
- WELL, BASICALLY, LIKE...

422
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,854
HE IS HAPPY
THAT HE'S ENGAGED.

423
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:58,525
BUT HE DID SAY
HE DEFINITELY PROPOSED TO YOU

424
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,627
WITH A YEAR SOONER
THAN INTENTIONALLY,

425
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,928
BUT HE WANTED TO DO IT
OUT OF RESPECT

426
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:05,032
FOR WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,

427
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,566
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NICE.

428
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,035
- BUT HE WAS GONNA
DO IT ANYWAY.

429
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:11,471
- HE WOULD'VE DONE IT
WITHIN A YEAR.

430
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,473
- OKAY, SO IT'S NOT BAD.

431
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,076
- HE LOVES YOUR LIFESTYLE.

432
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,511
AND IF ALL THIS GOES AWAY,

433
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,380
HE WOULD FIND A WAY
TO SUPPORT HIS FAMILY.

434
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,749
- IT'S ALL GOOD.
- YEAH.

435
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:24,784
- EVERYTHING
THAT I WANTED TO HEAR I HEARD.

436
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,486
AND I KINDA KNEW ANYWAY.

437
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:29,422
SO HOPEFULLY ME AND JIONNI WILL
BE MADLY IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER

438
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,923
AND HARDLY HAVE
ANY PROBLEMS,

439
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,392
YOU KNOW,
UNTIL THE DAY WE DIE.

440
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:35,328
- DOT, DOT, DOT.
I'M [bleep].

441
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,696
- IT WASN'T--NO.
NOT AT ALL.

442
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:38,531
HE'S [bleep]
SO IN LOVE WITH YOU.

443
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,433
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY CUTE.

444
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,135
HE SAID HE'S WILLING
TO DO WHATEVER...

445
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,736
- REALLY?
- TO MAKE YOU GUYS WORK.

446
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,305
HE SAID HE'S DEFINITELY
GONNA WORK ON IT,

447
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:49,076
AND HE SAID YOU HAVE
TWO BIG THINGS TO WORK ON,

448
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:52,145
WHICH IS LYING
AND TRUSTING HIM.

449
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:54,147
BECAUSE HE SAID
IT REALLY HURTS HIM

450
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:57,650
BECAUSE HE CARES AND LOVES YOU
TOO MUCH TO LEAVE YOU.

451
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,252
- REALLY?

452
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,653
THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY SHOCKING.

453
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,323
I'M VERY HAPPY THAT ROGER'S
ACTUALLY DEDICATED

454
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,625
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP
AND WORKING ON OUR PROBLEMS

455
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,328
BECAUSE I THOUGHT HE WAS
ON THE VERGE OF GIVING UP.

456
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:10,663
AND TO HEAR
THAT HE DOESN'T WANT TO

457
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:13,233
MAKES ME FEEL GOOD.

458
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,741
- OH, POOP.
POOP, POOP, POOP.

459
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:22,975
- CAN I?

460
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,412
THINK I CAN FIT JUST
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

461
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:27,447
- SOMEONE'S EXCITED TO LEAVE.

462
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,182
[doorbell]

463
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,917
THAT'S ROGER.

464
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,154
- HI!

465
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,123
DO YOU WANNA COME HOME?
- YEAH.

466
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:38,358
- WHY CAN'T MY POOP
COME FIRST?

467
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,796
- AWESOME, YOU GUYS ARE
ALL PACKED, READY TO GO.

468
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:44,964
- I AT LEAST STARTED.
- THAT'S GOOD.

469
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,966
- I DIDN'T START!
- AWESOME.

470
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:47,967
[doorbell]
- [squeals]

471
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,670
- UH-OH.
THAT'S YOUR BOY BLUE.

472
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,606
- I AM VERY EXCITED
FOR NICOLE TO MOVE IN WITH ME.

473
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:56,243
YOU KNOW, I GET TO SEE HER,
I GET TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

474
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:57,777
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE PREGNANCY,
I THINK SHE REALLY--

475
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,679
SHE REALLY NEEDS ME
TO BE BY HER SIDE.

476
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,948
- GO UPSTAIRS AND BRING
ALL MY LUGGAGES DOWN HERE.

477
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,152
CAN YOU PACK ALL MY SHOES
ON TOP?

478
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,819
- WHATEVER YOU WANT,
BABY.

479
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,021
- BOYFRIENDS ARE MANUAL LABOR.

480
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,423
I MEAN, THEY'RE CARRYING
THAT HEAVY [bleep]

481
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,558
DOWN THE STAIRS.

482
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:12,659
- YEAH, WE CAN'T DO
THAT [bleep].

483
00:18:12,659 --> 00:18:13,826
- MM-MM.

484
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,994
- POOP, DON'T BRING
MY COMFORTER.

485
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,396
JUST MAKE MY BED.

486
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,797
- I GOTTA MAKE IT?

487
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,599
- JIONNI'S ACTUALLY HELPING.
I'M IMPRESSED.

488
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,538
DON'T DO THAT
WITHOUT A PROPER SPOT.

489
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,608
- ARE THOSE RED BOOTS YOURS?

490
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,677
- WE'RE NOT DOING BAD.
- WHOO!

491
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:34,414
- TAKE EVERYTHING FROM UPSTAIRS,
AND PUT IT DOWNSTAIRS.

492
00:18:34,414 --> 00:18:36,516
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO THROW IT IN
LIKE YOU'RE ANGRY.

493
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:39,018
- SHUT UP.
- I'M JUST A BITCH.

494
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,953
- THIS IS THE MOST WORK
YOU'VE DONE IN THREE YEARS.

495
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,889
- AT LEAST.

496
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,624
ALL RIGHT, BABE,
I'M GONNA GO.

497
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,293
- I'M OUT.
- BYE.

498
00:18:46,293 --> 00:18:48,195
- THANK YOU, POOP.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

499
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:50,230
- LOVE YOU.

500
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,370
WHY ARE YOU SO FAR AWAY?

501
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,106
- I'M GONNA FURTHER AWAY
IN A LITTLE BIT.

502
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,409
- I ACTUALLY REALLY
DON'T WANNA GO.

503
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:04,244
- WAIT, WHY ARE WE
LEAVING AGAIN?

504
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:07,046
- BECAUSE YOU NEED TO FIX
[bleep] WITH ROGER,

505
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,316
AND I'M PREGNANT.

506
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,517
[giggling]

507
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,118
- IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE DISAPPEARING

508
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,953
FROM EACH OTHER'S LIVES.

00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:15,922
THAT'S MY GODCHILD IN THERE.

TOMORROW.

513
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,229
- SO WHO ARE WE KIDDING?

514
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:25,232

00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,537
IT FEELS BITTERSWEET
LEAVING JERSEY CITY.

517
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,706
- YEAH, WHO CAN SAY
THAT THEY LIVED IN A FIREHOUSE

518
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,542
AND TRANSITIONED IT
INTO, LIKE, GUIDETTE PALACE?

519
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,109
- MM-HMM.

520
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:40,012

A CUTE, LITTLE APARTMENT

522
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:44,150

00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,559
AND THEN AFTER, I'M GONNA
PROBABLY HAVE SEX WITH ROGER

526
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,261
TILL HE CAN'T HAVE SEX ANYMORE,

527
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,895
SO HE CAN SHUT THE [bleep] UP
ABOUT NOT HAVING SEX.

528
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:57,163
- THANK GOD!

529
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,131
