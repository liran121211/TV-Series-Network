1
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:05,506
- YOUR LITTLE BABY.

2
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:09,077
- YOU CREATED THAT...
DRUNK NIGHT.

3
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:10,544
- NO.

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:15,015
- I THINK WE SHOULD INVITE
THE ROOMMATES OVER.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,352
I DO HAVE IMPORTANT NEWS
TO TELL THEM.

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,987
- OH, YOU WANT TO TELL THEM?

7
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:22,056
- I THINK
I SHOULD TELL THEM.

8
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:24,058
- * I DON'T CARE *

9
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,659
* I LOVE IT *

10
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,961
* I DON'T CARE *

11
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:29,597
* I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT *

12
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:31,665
* I DON'T CARE *

13
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:35,002
* I LOVE IT *

14
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,804
* I DON'T CARE *

15
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,739
[drum music]

16
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,608
- THE REAL REASON WHY I INVITED
YOU GUYS HERE...

17
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:41,642
- UH-OH.

18
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:44,345
- IS BECAUSE ME
AND JIONNI ARE ENGAGED.

19
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:45,613
- WHAT?
- OH!

20
00:00:45,613 --> 00:00:46,947
- WAIT A SECOND.
TIME OUT.

21
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,282
I'M A LITTLE UPSET
ABOUT THIS.

22
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,717
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU DON'T EVEN
GET A GIRLFRIEND

23
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,984
FROM THE JERSEY SHORE.

24
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,954
A WIFE? A HUSBAND?
THAT'S OUT OF CONTROL.

25
00:00:53,954 --> 00:00:55,689
YOU THINK TWO YEARS
IS A LONG ENOUGH TIME

26
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:56,990
TO MARRY SOMEBODY...
- OH, HERE WE GO.

27
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,326
- TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR DAYS WITH?

28
00:00:58,326 --> 00:00:59,727
- LIKE, YEAH.

29
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:00,828
- YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE PERSON

30
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:02,396
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,
RIGHT?

31
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,431
- YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE PENIS

32
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,732
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,
RIGHT?

33
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,167
- I LOVE HIS PENIS.

34
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:07,735
- VINNY, YOU'RE, LIKE, HATING
ON THE WHOLE ENGAGEMENT?

35
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,870
- I'M TOTALLY JEALOUS,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

36
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,938
- CAN I SEE THE RING?

37
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:13,174
- WOW, THAT'S AMAZING.

38
00:01:13,174 --> 00:01:14,642
JIONNI CAN'T AFFORD
THAT [bleep].

39
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:15,709
THE KID DOESN'T HAVE NO JOB.

40
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,811
- DID SHE BUY IT?
- [laughs] STOP.

41
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,747
[laughter]

42
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:22,150
- THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
TO BUST MY BALLS ABOUT.

43
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,251
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
BE HAPPY FOR ME.

44
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,919
- YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE DIVORCED
SOON ANYWAY.

45
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,755
- GREAT.

46
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:32,160
- OH, BOY.

47
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:39,433
- AWKWARD.
[laughs]

48
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,569
- WELL, CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE ENGAGEMENT.

49
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:44,071
- YEAH. DIG IN.

50
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,606
[bleep].

51
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:48,809
- ARE YOU ENGAGED TOO?
- NO. I WISH.

52
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:49,777
- GIRL, YOU'RE
GETTING UP THERE, GIRL.

53
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:50,811
YOU NEED TO GET ON THAT.

54
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,780
- I KNOW.
ASK ROGER.

55
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,415
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
WITH ROG?

56
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:55,849
- ALMOST TWO YEARS.

57
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,285
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN WITH JIONNI?

58
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:58,519
- LIKE, THREE MONTHS.

59
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,587
- NO.
[laughter]

60
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:01,789
ALMOST TWO YEARS.

61
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:02,756
- THAT'S CRAZY YOU'RE ENGAGED.
THAT'S CRAZY.

62
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,592
YOU GREW UP.

63
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:05,893
I CAN'T PICTURE SNOOKI
BEING TIED DOWN,

64
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,295
UNLESS IT'S TO, LIKE,
A BEDPOST OR SOMETHING.

65
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,430
- WE'RE GONNA START LOADING
THE DISHWASHER.

66
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,031
- THIS IS WHAT
YOU COULD HAVE HAD, BABY.

67
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,367
[laughter]

68
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:15,469
I CLEAN AND I WORK.

69
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,238
- [laughs]
- SO DOES JIONNI.

70
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:19,273
- WHERE?
- ON YOUR VAGINA.

71
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:22,075
- SO?
[laughter]

72
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,744
- JUST PUT EVERYTHING
ON THE COUNTER.

73
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:25,713
WE'LL WORRY ABOUT IT LATER.

74
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,248
- IT'S TIME FOR DESSERT,
AND HONESTLY,

75
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,016
I'M NOT EVEN EXCITED TO TELL
THE ROOMMATES I'M PREGNANT

76
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,752
BECAUSE OF THE REACTION
I GOT SAYING I'M ENGAGED.

77
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,254
JENNI, CAN YOU HELP ME?

78
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,756
- YEAH.
- IT'S MY CAKE.

79
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,024
WAIT FOR IT.

80
00:02:37,024 --> 00:02:38,892
- OH, I GOTTA GET A KNIFE.

81
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,028
IT IS DESSERT TIME,
AND NICOLE LOOKS LIKE

82
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,231
A BAG OF
[bleep] SHAKING BONES

83
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:46,234
[laughter]

84
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:47,435
- SOMETHING'S GOING ON
WITH THIS CAKE.

85
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:50,371
- I'VE NEVER SEEN NICOLE
THIS TYPE OF NERVOUS.

86
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,805
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR BOW.

87
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,241
- READY?
- THAT'S CUTE.

88
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,142
- IT'S MY CAKE.

89
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,577
I LOVE IT.

90
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:58,145
BUT YOU HAVE TO SEE THE TOP
THAT'S ON IT.

91
00:02:58,145 --> 00:02:59,247
- IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
RIGHT NOW.

92
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,848
- WOW, THAT IS CRAZY.

93
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,450
- WHAT DOES IT SAY?

94
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,552
- "BY THE WAY,
I'M PREGNANT."

95
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,854
- HOLY [bleep], WHAT?
- OH, MY GOD.

96
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,756
- YOU'RE PREGNANT?
- HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

97
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:12,926
YOU'RE KNOCKED UP?
- YEAH.

98
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:15,263
- WOW.
- OH!

99
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:16,297
OH, WHAT'S COMING OUT
OF THE BOOB?

100
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,598
- WHAT ELSE ARE YOU HIDING?

101
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,800
- AT FIRST, HE WAS LIKE,
OH, MY GOD.

102
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,769
- OH, MY GOD,
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE ME.

103
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:22,870
- VINNY.
- VINNY.

104
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,871
- I DID NOT HAVE SEX
WITH SNOOKI,

105
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,506
LIKE, FOUR MONTHS AGO...

106
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:26,574
I DON'T THINK.

107
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,376
- I THOUGHT YOU PULLED OUT!

108
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,743
- HIS COUCH PULLS OUT.

109
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:30,978
- OH, [bleep]!

110
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,513
- IT'S NOT YOURS!
- IT'S NOT YOURS!

111
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,081
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

112
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,549
- YO, DNA TEST, BRO.

113
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:38,286
- OH, MY GOD, IT LOOKS LIKE
A LITTLE MEATBALL.

114
00:03:38,286 --> 00:03:39,287
- YES!

115
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:40,554
- MY MEATBALL'S ENGAGED,

116
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,656
AND SHE'S FRICKING GETTING
PREGNANT OVER HERE.

117
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:44,292
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

118
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:45,793
RIGHT NOW, I FEEL LIKE
THE ONLY MEATBALL I HAVE LEFT

119
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,595
IS THE ONE ON MY PLATE.

120
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:50,063
NO MORE MEATBALL DAYS,
UNTIL...

121
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,432
- WHEN IT POPS OUT,
THEN I'LL--

122
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,301
- WHEN IT POPS OUT, THEN YOU
GOTTA TAKE CARE OF IT.

123
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:54,702
- TAKE CARE OF IT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

124
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:57,104
- I KNOW.
- IT'S NOT JUST A PREGNANCY.

125
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,107
- I KNOW, BUT I'M ALLOWED TO
GO OUT ONCE TONIGHT.

126
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,909
- YAY! I DID IT! WHOO!
- IT'S NOT A RACE.

127
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,844
WHEN YOU CROSS THE LINE,
IT'S NOT LIKE, "I WIN!"

128
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:06,314
- JENNI, YOU KNOW THIS,
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT.

129
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,782
YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.

130
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:11,051
- OH, FIRST FIGHT!
FIRST FIGHT!

131
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:12,320
- FIRST HOME FIGHT!
- FIRST FIGHT!

132
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,921
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- STOP BEING SAD.

133
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:16,156
- LIKE, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE,
LIKE, A FUN MOMENT FOR ME,

134
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,058
AND HONESTLY,
AS A BEST FRIEND,

135
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:21,094
JENNI IS SUCKING
AT SUPPORTING ME.

136
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,563
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
GONNA BE YOU FIRST.

137
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,332
- I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED A KID SOON.

138
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:25,933
- NOT AFTER THE [bleep] I'VE
BEEN GOING THROUGH WITH HER.

139
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:28,636
SHE'S MISERABLE.
[laughs]

140
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,104
BECAUSE OF HER, I AM PETRIFIED
TO HAVE A KID.

141
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,373
- THAT'S REAL NICE.

142
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:33,841
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE HER FEEL
A LITTLE BETTER?

143
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,743
- [laughs]

144
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:38,145
TELL HER HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.
[laughs]

145
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:39,780
- THIS WASN'T HOW I WANTED
DINNER.

146
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,848
[laughter]
- IT SUCKS.

147
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,383
- IT NEVER IS, SNOOKS.

148
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,618
- SO DYSFUNCTIONAL.

149
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,787
- YOU'RE GONNA BE
A NICE YOUNG MOM WITH YOUR KID,

150
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,221
AND YOU'RE GONNA
GROW UP AND HAVE, LIKE,

151
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,591
A NICE, LIKE, LIFE
WITH YOUR KID.

152
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,493
- IT'S GONNA BE
THE MOST-LOVED BABY.

153
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:53,727
- YEAH.

154
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,363
- WE'LL BE HERE TO BACK YOU UP,
NO MATTER WHAT.

155
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:56,464
- THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

156
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,431
- YEAH, EVERYTHING HAPPENS
FOR A REASON.

157
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,432
THIS IS YOUR PATH.

158
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,667
- CONGRATS AGAIN.

159
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:00,934
- THANK YOU.

160
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,870
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WITH ALL THE BULL[bleep]

161
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,638
AND MAKING FUN OF ME
FOR EVERYTHING,

162
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,240
THEY'RE ALL ACTUALLY REALLY,
REALLY HAPPY FOR ME,

163
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,510
AND THEY'RE THERE FOR ME
IF I NEED ANYTHING,

164
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,380
SO IT FEELS REALLY GOOD
TO KNOW THAT I HAVE THEM.

165
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,247
- THAT WAS A LOT OF NEWS
OVER A DINNER.

166
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,183
- YEAH.
- THAT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN.

167
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,586
- THIS WAS FUN, GUYS.
- IT REALLY WAS.

168
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,488
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE EVERYBODY.
- HAPPY TO SEE YOU GUYS.

169
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,122
- I'M REALLY HAPPY
YOU GUYS CAME.

170
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,090
- THANK YOU GUYS, THOUGH.
APPRECIATE THIS.

171
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,525
- THANK YOU.

172
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:25,993
- BYE.
- LOVE YOU.

00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:40,073
TO ANNOUNCE AN ENGAGEMENT FIRST,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

181
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,009
- SORRY IF I SAID
ANYTHING WEIRD.

182
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,413
- YOU'VE BEEN SAYING THINGS
LIKE THAT THIS WHOLE TIME.

183
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:46,814

00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,262
- I DON'T KNOW IF
I'M PREPARED FOR THIS.

192
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:03,731
AM I GONNA HAVE NIGHTMARES?

193
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,898
- MAYBE.

194
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,333
SO, YOU KNOW,
I'M REALLY INTRIGUED

195
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,436

[laughter]

201
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,682

THE WORD "VAGINA."

202
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,350
- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK!

203
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,185
JUST SEEING BABIES
POP OUT OF VAGINAS,

204
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,854
IT'S JUST SO CRAZY.

205
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,456
THAT'S A BIG VAGINA.

206
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:29,790
- DUDE, LOOK AT HER HAND.

207
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,525
IT, LIKE, GOT SUCKED
IN THERE.

208
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:35,128
I'M WATCHING A VAGINA,
AND I HAD NO IDEA

209
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,064
HOW [bleep] FAR
IT STRETCHES.

210
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,600
- CHERYL IS ONLY
3 CENTIMETERS DILATED.

211
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,868
- "ONLY."
- [laughs]

212
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,836
- OH, REALLY?

AND I LOVE IT.

221
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,991
[laughs]

222
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:05,793
- MY DAD'S NEXT TO YOU!

223
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:08,095
- HE KNOWS I HAVE A TINY PENIS.
HE KNOWS.

224
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,998

I HAVEN'T GONE TO THE GYM.
I HAVEN'T GONE TANNING.

229
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,043

230
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,111

JENNI, ANSWER.
I'M SCARED.

00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,960
I JUST THINK ANTHONY

271
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,596
BECAUSE HE WANTS HIS MONEY--
[belches]

272
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:49,630
OH, MY GOD.

273
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,698

00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,288
JIONNI'S HERE,

I'D SAY THAT TAKES YOU FOUR TO
SIX HOURS TO PUT THAT TOGETHER.

311
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,582
- WE'RE DONE.

312
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,618
- NO, WE JUST STARTED,
AND IT'S AL--ALMOST DONE.

313
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:22,622

OH, MY GOD,
I'M [bleep] DRIPPIN'.

316
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,195
- IT WAS NOT GOING WELL
AT ALL,

317
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,663
AND IT WAS LIKE
A FIVE-YEAR-OLD KID

318
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,732
TRYING TO BUILD A PYRAMID.
IT WAS CRAZY.

319
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:32,733
- I JUST HAVE TO GET THIS
ON THERE.

320
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,001

- I DON'T HEAR ANY CLANKING
GOING ON OUT THERE.

327
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,180
IS HE PUTTING IT TOGETHER?

328
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,348
- NO IDEA.

329
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,051

330
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,419

- THAT'S WHY I SAID
BUY AN ASSEMBLED GRILL.

335
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,364
- I KNEW PUTTING THIS
GRILL TOGETHER

336
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,768
WAS GONNA BE A LITTLE TOUGH,
BUT NOTHING WAS FITTING RIGHT.

337
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:11,504
- THIS GOES DOWN THROUGH HERE,
NITWIT, LIKE THAT.

338
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,107
WHAT, DID YOU JUST THINK
IT BALANCED ON THERE?

345
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,556
- WHY IS HE GONNA KICK YOU
IN THE BALLSACK?

346
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:31,925
- I DON'T GOTTA EXPLAIN MYSELF
TO THIS KID.

347
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,361
- ARE YOU GUYS REALLY FIGHTING
OUT HERE OR FAKE FIGHTING?

348
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,463
- NO, I'M KICKING YOU
IN THE BALLS.

00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,501

OH, MY GOD.

OKAY, THIS IS WHERE
MY HEAD WOULD BE.

361
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,551
KICK ME IN THE HEAD.

00:11:59,686 --> 00:12:01,454

AND RAINBOWS COME OUT.

425
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:09,216
- I HEARD YOU SAY
"CREAMY ITALIAN."

'CAUSE I CAN'T DRINK.

444
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:45,718
- I'M NOT.

445
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:49,189
- THAT'S DIFFERENT.
YOU'RE OLD.

446
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,758
BEING THE ONLY SOBER ONE
HERE, YOU KNOW, IT SUCKS,

- JENNI!
- DO IT!

460
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,481
- JOEY LOVES TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME,

00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,349
AND HE ALWAYS
MAKES ME LAUGH,

462
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:18,085
AND HE'S DEFINITELY DRINKING

463
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,852
'CAUSE HE'S SO DRUNK,
AND I KNOW HE'S GONNA REGRET IT.

464
00:15:19,852 --> 00:15:22,589
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T STOP
JOEY FROM HAVING FUN.

465
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,892
- TANNING!
- WHERE IS THAT TAN LINE FROM?

466
00:15:25,892 --> 00:15:30,130
[laughter]

467
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,399
- YES!

468
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,302
- HE IS GIVING HIMSELF
WEDGIES

469
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,436
AND PULLING
HIS UNDERWEARS UP

470
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,038
AND PULLING HIS SHIRT UP.

471
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,639
- JENNI, COME ON!

472
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,641
I DID IT!
IT'S IN THERE.

473
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,011
I FEEL LIKE I SEE A BALL POP OUT
OF THE SIDE OF HIS UNDERWEAR.

474
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,513
IT'S JUST--
I'M JUST TOO CLOSE.

475
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,880
IT'S TOO CLOSE.

476
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,417
- DO I LOOK LIKE
A JUICEHEAD GUIDO, NICOLE?

477
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,085
- YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.

478
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,653
OH, MY GOD, DON'T FALL.

479
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,721
[laughter]

00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:56,423
WHERE'S JIONNI?

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,565
- YOU GOT ME, BUDDY.

- JOEY'S BUTT CRACK
IS ACTUALLY TAN NOW.

491
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,178
- OH, WE DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO THE LIQUOR STORE.

492
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:20,280
- THERE IT IS.
- YOU SAVED THE DAY, BRO.

494
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:23,050
- HI, ROGER.

495
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,517
- YO, WHAT'S GOING ON,
MY MAN?

496
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,653
- ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT ME
MORE THAN A FRIEND?

497
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,588
- WHAT?
- NO? WHOOPSY.

498
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,658

499
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,593
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

500
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:36,296
SO NICOLE'S JOEY SEEMS LIKE HE'S
TAKEN A LITTLE LIKING TO ME.

- VERY, VERY FIT.

511
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,361
THERE'S NO REASON I SHOULD HAVE
FELL FROM THE COUCH.

512
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,263
THAT'S IT.

513
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:13,733
- I'VE NEVER BEEN DENIED SEX
MORE OFTEN

514
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:17,003
THAN BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP
WITH JENNI.

515
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,571
- I DON'T EVEN THINK ROGER
REALIZES RIGHT NOW

516
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,107
THE AMOUNT OF SEXUAL COMMENTS
HE'S MAKING,

517
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:21,241
'CAUSE HE'S SO DRUNK.

518
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,476
- I HAVE A TINY [bleep]
AND I LOVE IT.

519
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:24,777
[laughs]

520
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,646
- ESPECIALLY RIGHT NEXT
TO MY FATHER.

521
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,481
- MY DAD'S NEXT TO YOU!

522
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:30,517
- HE KNOWS I HAVE A TINY PENIS.
HE KNOWS.

523
00:17:30,517 --> 00:17:33,386
- I FEEL LIKE ROGER
JUST DOESN'T KNOW

524
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,587
WHEN ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

525
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,457
- I'M SO DEADLY HONEST,
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

526
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:40,193
I'VE HAD CHLAMYDIA FOUR TIMES,
AND I'LL TELL EVERYBODY HERE.

527
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,362
- HE'S RIGHT NEXT TO MY DAD!

528
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,930
I HAVE TO PEE.

529
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,332
- IT'LL PROBABLY BURN
A LITTLE BIT, BUT--

530
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,567
[laughter]

531
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,668
- I'M NOT GONNA
HAVE SEX WITH YOU

532
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,704
IF YOU'RE GONNA KEEP
JOKING ABOUT IT.

533
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:52,705
- WHAT'S UP?

534
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:53,973
- THIS IS MORE LIKE IT.

535
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,143
A LITTLE BREAK
FROM THE ACTION.

536
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:58,178
- WHAT'S YOUR TAKE
ON THE GIRLS?

537
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,879
- I THINK IT'S AWESOME.

538
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,414
- I SEE THEM, UH--

539
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,049
- MATURING.
- YEAH.

540
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,985
- OH, [bleep].
all: OH!

541
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,421
- THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT
IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.

542
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:11,158
- THREE YEARS, IT'S AMAZING
HOW FAR THEY'VE--THEY'VE COME.

543
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:14,494
- I'M GLAD THEY BECAME
AS CLOSE OF FRIENDS AS THEY ARE.

544
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,263
THEY LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER.
- YEP.

545
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:17,730
SO ARE YOU MORE RELIEVED NOW?

546
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,931
- YEAH. YEAH, I AM.

547
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,301
- THEY'RE GROWING UP,
IN A SENSE.

548
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:22,802
- YEP.

549
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,704
[hip-hop music]

550
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:25,705
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S HIT THE ROAD.

551
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:28,941
- BYE, HANDSOME.
- I LOVE YOU, BABY.

552
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,410
- I LOVE YOU.
- LOVE YOU TOO.

553
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,078
- IT IS GETTING LATE,

554
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,313
SO RIGHT NOW,
WE'RE WRAPPING IT UP.

555
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,881
EVERYBODY CAN GET
THE [bleep] OUT.

556
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,483
I LOVE YOU.

557
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:37,517
AND NOW IT'S TIME
TO GO TO BED.

558
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:38,518
- BYE.

559
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:39,852
OH, MY GOD, IT'S TIME.

560
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,621
I CAN FINALLY
SMUSH JIONNI.

561
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,055
I'VE BEEN WAITING
ALL [bleep] NIGHT.

562
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,657
YOU'RE GRILLING?

563
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,593
- JUST TWO BURGERS.
YOU WANT ANYTHING?

564
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:47,827
- I WANT TO [bleep] CUDDLE.

565
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,662
- ALL RIGHT, I PROMISE,
WE'RE GONNA CUDDLE.

566
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:51,564
- USUALLY,
WHEN YOU ARE PREGNANT,

567
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,533
YOU JUST WANT NOTHING
TO DO WITH SEX,

568
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:56,203
BUT I'M ACTUALLY STARTING
TO GET MY SEX DRIVE BACK,

569
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:57,404
AND NOW HE WANTS
TO COOK BURGERS

570
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,772
AND HANG OUT WITH ROGER.
I MEAN...

571
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:01,408
WHATEVER.
DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

572
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,475
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT
RIGHT NOW,

573
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,610
MORE THAN ANYTHING?

574
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,811
- VAGINA?

575
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,846
- NO, I WANT A REMATCH AT YOU
KICKING MY HAND

576
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,215
AT MY HEAD HEIGHT.

577
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:09,382
- I'M NOT DRUNK.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

578
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,050
- YOU CAME UP, LIKE,
A FOOT SHORT.

579
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,452
- CAN YOU REACH MY HEAD?
CAN YOU REALLY REACH MY HEAD?

580
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:14,321
- SERIOUSLY, BRO.
- NO, I'M BEING SERIOUS.

581
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,323
A GUY YOUR SIZE,
CAN YOU REACH MY HEAD?

582
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,758
- ARE YOU GIVING ME PERMISSION
TO KICK YOU IN YOUR HEAD?

583
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,793
- YOU CAN'T KICK MY HEAD.
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

584
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:22,629
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- GOOD. ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

585
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,997
YOU KICK MY HAND RIGHT NOW.
- NO, YOUR HEAD.

586
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,399
CAN I KICK YOU IN YOUR HEAD?
- GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.

587
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:28,235
- CAN I KICK YOU IN YOUR HEAD?
- GO AHEAD.

588
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:29,636
OH, [bleep], IF ROGER
KICKS ME IN THE HEAD,

589
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,271
I MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE HERE.

590
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,240
- JIONNI.
- I PROMISE, GO AHEAD.

591
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,140
- I'M GONNA BREAK THIS KID
LIKE A TWIG,

592
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,242
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

593
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,142
- GO AHEAD.
THIS'LL BE GOOD.

594
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:37,244
- IN YOUR HEAD? OKAY.

595
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:39,346
[laughs]
- THAT WAS MY SHOULDER.

596
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,580
- ALL RIGHT,
CAN I GO AGAIN?

597
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,250
- NO, ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

598
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,251
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE,
HE HIT ME IN THE HEAD,

599
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,252
I WASN'T GETTING UP.

600
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:46,653
HE JUST KICKED ME.
- ARE YOU HURT?

601
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:49,322
- NAH, HE HIT ME
ON A GOOD SPOT.

602
00:19:49,322 --> 00:19:52,091
- [laughs]
- OH, MY GOD.

603
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,626
I'M SO OVER SMUSHING
WITH JIONNI.

604
00:19:53,626 --> 00:19:54,727
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN WAITING
THIS WHOLE NIGHT,

605
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,296
AND I'M JUST LIKE,
"[bleep] IT."

606
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,665
LIKE, YOU KNOW,
WE WON'T EVEN CUDDLE.

607
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:01,234
OH, MY GOD.

608
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,770
- GOOD NIGHT, KIDS.

609
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,204
[sighs]

610
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:10,109
- STOP.
- STOP IT.

611
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,245
- I JUST WANT TO SNUGGLE.

612
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,946
- THEN SNUGGLE.

613
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,417
- OW!
- OH, SORRY.

614
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,151
WHEN ME AND JIONNI SMUSH,
IT'S NOT LIKE SEX.

615
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:22,154
IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN LOVE
AND IT'S VERY PASSIONATE.

616
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:24,090
IT'S NOT, LIKE,
RANDOM RABBIT SEX.

617
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,426
IT'S LIKE REAL SEX.

618
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,694
- [faint]
BABE...

619
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,697
BABY...

620
00:20:30,697 --> 00:20:32,832
YET ANOTHER NIGHT FOR ME
OF NOT GETTING LAID.

621
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,034
OH, MY GOD.

622
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,708
- I'M VOLUNTEERING TODAY.
OH, MY GOD, THERE'S JUMPERS.

623
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,576
AAH!
[laughs]

624
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,977
HELLO.
WAAH!

625
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,046
- DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR
THAT YOU JUST CONSTANTLY

626
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,448
BULL[bleep] ME
AND LIE TO ME?

627
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,717
- I DON'T BULL[bleep]
AND LIE TO YOU, ROGER.

628
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:51,951
- WOW.

629
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:52,919
JUST DON'T LIE.
JUST DON'T LIE.

630
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,020
IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

631
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,589
- WHAT'S GOING ON
RIGHT NOW?
