00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,173
TORTURE TO BE FLAUNTING
IN MY FACE.

173
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,042
- I THOUGHT YOU LOVED
BEING PREGNANT THOUGH.

174
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,076
- I DO.

175
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,310
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BE AROUND

176
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,513
THAT SCENARIO AT ALL
DURING MY PREGNANCY.

177
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:21,582
- I'VE HAD PREGNANT FRIENDS,
NINE MONTHS PREGNANT

178
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,216
AND ABLE TO HAVE FUN.

179
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,554
AND WE WERE, LIKE, "COOL,
SHE CAN'T HAVE FUN WITH US."

180
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,756
- I WOULD PROBABLY NEVER GO
ON VACATION AGAIN PREGNANT.

181
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,491
IT'S JUST NOT FUN.

182
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,961
- TAKE A NICE VACAY WITH JIONNI.

183
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,463
- I WONDER WHERE
THEY'RE GOING, ANYWAY?

184
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:38,331
I'M, LIKE, TRYING
TO THINK WHAT HE'S WEARING.

185
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,033
- OH, I JUST [bleep]ING
FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

186
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,469
- OH, SORRY.

187
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:44,071
- HE KEPT HIS PLANS WITH JIONNI
AND THEN CANCELLED FOR ME.

188
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,774
OH, I HATE GETTING BLOWN OFF.

189
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:47,808
[dial tone]

190
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,578
[phone buttons beeping]

191
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,879
[line ringing]

192
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,483
- [clears throat]

193
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:56,784
- HI, THIS IS JIONNI.

194
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,218
- AND ROGER.

195
00:06:58,218 --> 00:06:59,753
- WE CAN'T GET TO THE PHONE
RIGHT NOW, PLEASE LEAVE

196
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,154
A MESSAGE AFTER THE BEEP.

197
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,256
- AND AN APOLOGY WOULD BE NICE
IF YOU EXPECT TO SEE ME

198
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,958
IN JERSEY CITY
ANYTIME SOON.

199
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,627
- LATER, BITCHES.

200
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:07,628

201
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:09,296
PLEASE RECORD YOUR MESSAGE.

202
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,363
[voice mail beeps]

203
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,132
- YOU GUYS ARE SO ANNOYING.

204
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:13,801
- WHY WOULD I WANT TO APOLOGIZE

205
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,402
AFTER THEY SOUNDED LIKE
[bleep] JOEY?

206
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:17,237
- I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO TALK TO THEM.

207
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,507
- [laughs]
- [groans] "LATER, BITCHES."

208
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:22,109
- [laughs] OH,
THAT'S NOT EVEN RIGHT.

209
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,577
- IDIOTS.

210
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,713
- [automated voice] TO CONTINUE
RECORDING WHERE YOU LEFT OFF,

211
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,080
PRESS FOUR.

212
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,982
IF YOU'RE SATISFIED

215
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,521
[laughter]

216
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:35,656
[screams] DID I SAY SOMETHING?

217
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,991
[dial tone]
DID I SAY SOMETHING BAD?

218
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:39,860
I DIDN'T ACTUALLY HANG UP,
AND EVERYTHING

219
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,831
THAT ME AND JENNI SAID
WAS RECORDED ON THE VOICEMAIL.

220
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,065
- WHAT'S UP?

221
00:07:45,065 --> 00:07:46,366
- DON'T LISTEN
TO THAT LAST VOICEMAIL.

222
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,735
- WHY?

223
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:49,336
- 'CAUSE WE WERE TALKING
[bleep] AND I THOUGHT I HUNG UP.

224
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:50,838
- [laughs]

225
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,540
- MISS YOU.

226
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,574
- [laughs]

227
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:55,142
- WHERE ARE YOU GUYS?

228
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,244
- UM, WE'RE AT CARMINE'S
RIGHT NOW.

229
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,547
- OH.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING AFTER?

230
00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:00,881
- ACROSS THE STREET?

231
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:01,982
I DON'T KNOW,
HEMINGWAY'S MAYBE.

232
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,117
- THEY'RE GOING
TO HEMINGWAY'S!

233
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:06,119
- I THINK I'M ACTUALLY
GOING TO BREAK UP WITH HIM.

234
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,120
- [gasps]

235
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,556
- WHY ARE YOU
FREAKING OUT?

236
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:10,323
- THERE'S GONNA BE,
LIKE, GIRLS THERE.

237
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,925
- THERE'S NOT
GONNA BE GIRLS.

238
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,426
WE'RE NOT--NICOLE.

239
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,728
IF I WAS TRYING
TO HIDE [bleep] FROM YOU,

240
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,031
WE WOULDN'T LEAVE YOU GUYS
A MESSAGE JOKING AROUND.

241
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,032
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL LET YOU GO.

242
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,002
YOU GUYS HAVE FUN.

243
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,572
HE'S ANNOYING.
- NOW I'M [bleep]ING PISSED.

244
00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,640
- I'D RATHER JIONNI GO
ANYWHERE ELSE BUT HEMINGWAY'S.

245
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,576
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
IT'S GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

246
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:29,810
- THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

247
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,111
- WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

248
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,813
- I'M CALLING HIM
NOT TO APOLOGIZE.

249
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,414
- OH, GOD, DO I NEED
TO GET EAR-MUFFS?

250
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:37,017
[dial tone]
[phone buttons beeping]

251
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,819
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

252
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:40,253
- I DON'T KNOW YET.

253
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,623
[dial tone]

254
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,758
- HELLO?
- HELLO?

255
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:47,394
- YO.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "YO"?

256
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,396
- JUST YO.

257
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,599
- THAT'S HOW
YOU ANSWER THE PHONE?

258
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:54,234
- I SAID, "HELLO?"
- OH.

259
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,803
I'M NOT CALLING
TO APOLOGIZE,

260
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:57,037
BUT I GUESS
I'M GONNA EXPLAIN

261
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,839
MYSELF AS A HUMAN BEING,

262
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,341
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
I LEFT OFF SCREAMING.

263
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,643
I WAS COMING HOME EARLY.

264
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,445
I GOT REALLY EXCITED
THAT I COULD BE HOME WITH YOU,

265
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,014
BUT YOU GAVE ME ATTITUDE.

266
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,749
- NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I SPOKE WITH JIONNI...

267
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:10,283
- AND I AM TRYING--
- AND FOUND OUT

268
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:11,318
HE WASN'T GOING.

269
00:09:11,318 --> 00:09:12,820
- BUT YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

270
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,623
OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS NOT THEIR RELATIONSHIP

271
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:16,890
AND YOU KNOW WHAT--

272
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,891
- THAT'S FOR SURE.
- WHAT?

273
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,226
- THEY HAVE A BETTER ONE
THAN WE DO.

274
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,028
- ARE YOU REALLY GONNA
BE LIKE THIS RIGHT NOW?

275
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,630
- I'M GONNA SPEAK MY MIND
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.

276
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,664
I SURE AM.

277
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:24,698
- YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU DID?

278
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:25,799
YOU PUT ME IN
THE SAME MINDSET

279
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,200
THAT I WAS TWO YEARS AGO,

280
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,002
SOME INSECURE LITTLE [bleep]

281
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:30,303
THAT YOU DIDN'T
GIVE A [bleep] ABOUT.

282
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,839
- WHICH YOU ARE,
WHICH YOU ARE.

283
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,473
- I AM HURT.
I AM HURT.

284
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,675
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO SPEAK TO ME

285
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,309
FOR THE REST OF THIS TIME,
I DON'T CARE.

286
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,645
BUT I AM GOING TO EXPLAIN
TO YOU--

287
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:38,912
- OKAY, NO PROBLEM,
I WON'T CALL YOU.

288
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,714
I ASSURE YOU OF THAT.
I WILL NOT CALL YOU.

289
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:43,516
- THIS IS--I'M TRYING TO BE
THE ADULT HERE FOR ONCE.

290
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,653
- OKAY, WELL, THAT'S FINE.
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE HURT,

291
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,554
AND I AM NOT
APOLOGIZING FOR ANYTHING.

292
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:48,656
I DID NOTHING WRONG.

293
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:49,823
YOU SHOULD BE WITH TOM.

294
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,525
YOU GUYS WERE PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER.

295
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:54,962
- BY TELLING ME THAT
I SHOULD BE WITH MY EX,

296
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:57,931
HE CAN GO [bleep] HIMSELF,
AND HE CAN BURN IN HELL.

297
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,734
- NO, YOU CALLED ME THE MOST
INSECURE PERSON IN THE WORLD.

298
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,804
- YOU ARE, HANDS DOWN.
- EW, PLEASE DON'T CRY.

299
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,138
- HANDS DOWN.

300
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,374
- [crying] YOU TOLD ME
I DESERVE TO BE WITH MY EX.

301
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,210
- AT LEAST YOU AND TOM
TREATED EACH OTHER EQUAL.

302
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,812
AT LEAST.
- LISTEN TO YOU.

303
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,781
- YOU DO NOT TREAT ME EQUAL.
- NO! IT WASN'T EQUAL.

304
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:16,516
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

305
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,185
AND HOW DARE YOU TELL ME
THAT I DESERVE--

306
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,586
THAT'S ALL I CAN GET.

307
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,854
- WELL, IT'S TRUTH
AND YOU HATE TRUTH.

308
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,589
- NO, I JUST DON'T LIKE YOU

309
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,858
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY
GENUINELY MISSED YOU.

310
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:27,260
AND I DON'T MISS YOU ANYMORE
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM.

311
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,064
[sniffling]

312
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,139
- YOU TOLD ME I DESERVE
TO BE WITH MY EX.

313
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,074
I DON'T CARE IF YOU CALL ME
OVERDRAMATIC, INSECURE--

314
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,075
WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL ME.

315
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,543
THAT REALLY [bleep]ING HURT.

316
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,312
MY ONLY INTENTIONS
WERE TO SEE

317
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,147
THE BOYFRIEND OF TWO YEARS
THAT I HAVE.

318
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,482
OR WHATEVER
I HAVE LEFT OF.

319
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,650
ALL RIGHT?

320
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,685
- OKAY.

321
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:53,220
- GOOD-BYE.

322
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:56,489
WHAT A DOUCHE-BAG,
I HATE HIM.

323
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,058
- WHY DOES HE PUT YOU DOWN
LIKE THAT?

324
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,394
- I DON'T KNOW, IT HURTS.

325
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,931
- OH.

326
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,366
- [sniffling]
I [bleep]ING HATE MY EX,

327
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,136
AND THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS?

328
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,570
- I THINK HE KNOWS
THAT WASN'T

329
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,373
THE RIGHT THING
TO SAY.

330
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,208
- HE SAYS THE ONLY THINGS
THAT WILL [bleep]ING

331
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,946
HURT MY FEELINGS.

332
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:22,015
- SORRY.
- IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

333
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,483
- I FEEL BAD.

334
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,551
- I FEEL LIKE
HE JUST CROSSED

335
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:25,853
THE LINE THIS TIME.

336
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:27,420
- I THINK SO TOO.

337
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,758
I DON'T THINK HE REALIZES
HOW MEAN HE CAN BE.

338
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,793
- I'M NOT PERFECT,
I'LL ADMIT IT.

339
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,161
BUT I DON'T--
- NO ONE'S PERFECT.

340
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,562
I'M NOT [bleep]ING PERFECT.

341
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:37,164
- I DON'T THINK
I DESERVE THAT.

342
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,766
- YOU DON'T.
NO ONE DESERVES THAT.

343
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,667
- NICOLE'S BEING THERE
FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

344
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,502
NO MATTER HOW UPSET
OR PISSED OFF

345
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,771
SHE WAS AT ME
IN CANCUN,

346
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:45,773
LIKE, SHE'S STILL THERE
FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

347
00:11:45,773 --> 00:11:50,043
- I FEEL LIKE HE,
LIKE, DUG HIS HOLE.

348
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,880
[laughs]

349
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,447
- I PULLED MY HAIR OUT.

350
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,250
- YOU'RE, LIKE, POPPING BLOOD
VESSELS, LOSING EXTENSIONS.

351
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,019
OH, MY GOD.
PLEASE.

352
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:00,921
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

353
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,355
I DON'T THINK ME AND ROGER
ARE GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH THIS

354
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:03,656
BECAUSE OF WHAT
HE SAID TO ME.

355
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:04,825
- GOOD NIGHT.

356
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,259
- GOOD NIGHT, LOVE YOU.

357
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,394
TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW

358
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,561
IF WE'RE TOGETHER
AT THIS POINT.

359
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,562
[Amber Rubarth's
One Last Look]

360
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,099
- * I FALL APART EVERY TIME *

361
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,433
* THAT I TAKE *

362
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,904
* ONE LAST LOOK AT YOU *

363
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:19,807
* *

364
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:30,450
- MORNING.
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

365
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,684
- LIKE [bleep].

366
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,286
WORST SLEEP EVER.

367
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:34,554
- 'CAUSE OF ROGER?

368
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,688
- MM-HM.

369
00:12:35,688 --> 00:12:38,658
I'VE NEVER CRIED
SO HARD IN MY LIFE.

370
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,360
[bleep] EMBARRASSING.

371
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,030
I DIDN'T EVEN WANNA
GET OUT OF BED TODAY.

372
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,832
- I WOULD HAVE LAID
WITH YOU ALL DAY.

373
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:46,133
- YEAH, I WOULD HAVE.

374
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,500
- AND I REALLY DIDN'T
GET GOOD SLEEP LAST NIGHT,

375
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,269
AND I'M SURE YOU DIDN'T.

376
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,205
- DON'T YOU HEAR
MY STOMACH RIGHT NOW?

377
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,908
- MY STOMACH IS GROWING.

378
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,176
- IT'S A GOOD THING.

379
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:59,179
- LIKE, COME HERE,
FEEL RIGHT NOW.

380
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,448
LIKE, GO FROM--
NOT MY VAGINA-BONE,

381
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,150
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT'S CALLED.

382
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,887
- BUT RIGHT--JUST GO UP.

383
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:07,955
FEEL IT?
IT'S, LIKE, HARD.

384
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:09,890
LIKE, A PREGNANT STOMACH.

385
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,092
- EXCITED?

386
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,861
SO IT'S NOT
A WEIRD STOMACH ANYMORE?

387
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:16,263
IT'S A PREGNANT ONE?
- IT'S STARTING TO FORM.

388
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,898
I WAS SLEEPING LIKE THIS.

389
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,032
- [laughs]

390
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,667
- I WAS, LIKE, "GOOD NIGHT."

391
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,669
AS OF RIGHT NOW
IT'S STARTING TO FORM.

392
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,104
SO WHEN EVERYONE,
YOU KNOW,

393
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,106
STARTS TO TOUCH IT,
I FEEL LIKE I'M FINE RIGHT NOW

394
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,075
BECAUSE YOU CAN
ACTUALLY FEEL IT.

395
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,877
BUT YOU COULDN'T
FEEL IT BEFORE AND I'M, LIKE,

396
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,611
"[bleep]
STOP TOUCHING MY FAT."

397
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:33,546
both: [chuckling]

398
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,148
- ARE YOU DOING THE LAPTOP?

399
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:38,218
- YEAH, I'M GOOGLING
WHAT 14 WEEKS IS.

400
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,253
- I'M WONDERING
WHAT IT'S DOING IN THERE.

401
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,554
- "THIS WEEK'S
BIG DEVELOPMENTS.

402
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,924
YOUR BABY CAN NOW SQUINT..."

403
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,492
- EW.
- "FROWN.

404
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,727
- "GRIMACE, PEE,
AND POSSIBLY SUCK HIS THUMB."

405
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,397
- WHAT THE [bleep]
IS GRIMACE?

406
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,199
EW!

407
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,766
- "AND YOUR BABY
SEES LIGHT."

408
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,568
- WHAT LIGHT?

409
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,139
MY VAGINA HOLE?

410
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,909
- IT MAY MOVE IF YOU SHINE
A FLASHLIGHT AT YOUR BELLY.

411
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,977
- I WANNA TELL MY BABY
IN MORSE CODE,

412
00:14:03,977 --> 00:14:06,279
"I'M SORRY IF IT'S WEIRD
IN THERE,

413
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,081
"BUT I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE YOU.

414
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,683
"AND I'M SORRY
IF YOU FEEL DADDY'S PENIS

415
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,652
EVERY TIME WE HAVE SEX."

416
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,722
THERE'S A [bleep]ING CREATURE
INSIDE OF ME, IT'S SO WEIRD.

417
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,596
WHAT TIME IS COOKING CLASS?

418
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,198
- YOU WANT TO GO
TO COOKING CLASS WITH ME?

419
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,300
- YEAH.
- OH, REALLY?

420
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,735
- JENNI ASKED ME TO GO
TO THE COOKING CLASS

421
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,137
WITH HER LAST-MINUTE.

422
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,940
CLEARLY, SHE'S UPSET
AND I JUST FEEL REALLY BAD.

423
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,075
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO BE THERE
FOR JENNI RIGHT NOW.

424
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,944
- ALL RIGHT, CAN YOU GET
IN COMFY CLOTHES WITH ME THOUGH?

425
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:37,945
[dog barking]

426
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:39,146
- UH-UH.

427
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:40,213
- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE PASTA
IN THAT?

428
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:41,648
- YEAH.

429
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,120
OH, THIS IS WHERE IT IS?

430
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,555
- YOU DROPPED ME OFF.

431
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,756
- HI.

432
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,959
- HEY, GUYS.
- HI, SORRY WE'RE LATE.

433
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,060
- PAUL.
- NICOLE.

434
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,327
- HI, PAUL.
HI, BABE.

435
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,795
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HI.

436
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,965
- I'M NICOLE. NICE TO MEET YOU.
- I LIKE YOUR HAIR.

437
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,967
- THIS IS DEFINITELY
COOKING 101 FOR ME.

438
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,001
- THIS IS NICOLE.

439
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,069
- I'M CELESTE.
- HI.

440
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,103
- HI, NICOLE,
PLEASURE MEETING YOU.

441
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,437
- YOU TOO.

442
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:05,805
I REALLY DON'T KNOW
HOW TO COOK ANYTHING.

443
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,840
AND, YOU KNOW, HAVING A BABY
AND BEING A WIFE,

444
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,842
I NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO [bleep]ING COOK.

445
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:11,979
- OKAY, YOU GUYS,
WE ARE MAKING

446
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:16,116
A CHEESE RICOTTA RAVIOLI,
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE PAIRED

447
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:18,751
WITH FRESH TOMATO SAUCE.

448
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,753
- I THOUGHT PASTA
COMES IN A BOX.

449
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,989
- SERIOUSLY.

450
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:24,424
- YOU SEE HOW THE DOUGH
IS COMING TOGETHER?

451
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,658
I'M NOT A PERFECT...

452
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,627
- [whispers] UNCIRCUMCISED.

453
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:29,029
- EW.

454
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:32,065
IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE
AN UNCIRCUMCISED PENIS.

455
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:35,102
AND IT REALLY IS GROSSING ME OUT
BECAUSE IT'S DISGUSTING.

456
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,004
- SHE SHOWED ME
AN UNCIRCUMCISED PENIS,

457
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,606
AND I'M SCORNED FOR--
NO OFFENSE IF YOU HAVE ONE--

458
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,241
AND I'M SCORNED FOR LIFE.

459
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,443
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

460
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:46,179
crack!

461
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,480
- MAY I HAVE THAT OIL?

462
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,816
PASTA MAKING IS ACTUALLY
PRETTY FUN RIGHT NOW.

463
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:50,850
- OH!

464
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,152
[laughter]

465
00:15:52,152 --> 00:15:54,621
YEAH, I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE VERY, VERY HARD AND ANNOYING.

466
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,089
- MMM.

467
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:58,058
- BUT IT'S ACTUALLY FUN
TO, LIKE, MAKE THE DOUGH

468
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,760
AND THEN ROLL IT OUT
AND THEN MAKE SLICES.

469
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,862
IT'S FUN TO MAKE RAVIOLIS.

470
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:04,031
- UNCIRCUMCISED.

471
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,065
splat!

472
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,199
- [gasps]

473
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,900
- [laughs]
- [gasps] JENNI!

474
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,603
IT'S IN MY [bleep]ING
EYELASH NOW.

475
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,040
- I JUST STRIKED YOU
WITH AN UNCIRCUMCISED...

476
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,374
- COME ON!

477
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,209
- IT'S NOTHING NEW,
IT'S NOTHING NEW.

478
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,445
NICOLE, ALL OF SUDDEN
HAS A PROBLEM

479
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,848
WITH A LITTLE PENIS
ON HER FACE.

480
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,284
I FEEL LIKE ME AND ROGER
WOULD END UP IN A FISTFIGHT

481
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,518
IF WE DID THIS TOGETHER.

482
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,187
- ME AND JIONNI,
THIS WOULD BE A JOKE.

483
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,655
- AT LEAST YOU'RE
SOMEWHAT AGREEING WITH ME.

484
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,190
- I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

485
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,724
- OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA
START MAKING YOUR FILLING.

486
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,060
- I'M ON YOUR SIDE
EVEN WHEN YOU'RE WRONG.

487
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,062
- THAT'S WHAT
BEST FRIENDS ARE FOR.

488
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:36,429
- MM-HM.

489
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,432
- NICOLE SAW HOW UPSET I WAS
AND SHE WAS CONSOLING ME,

490
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,068
AND THAT'S WHAT
GOOD FRIENDS DO.

491
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,435
- FINALLY!

492
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:43,803
LIKE, I WOULD DIE FOR YOU.

493
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:44,837
- YEAH, 100%.

494
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,539
I WOULD TAKE
A BULLET FOR YOU.

495
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:47,974
- BUT LET'S MAKE SURE
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

496
00:16:47,974 --> 00:16:49,076
- YEAH.

497
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,111
- CHEERS TO THE SIX OF US.

498
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:52,345
- CHEERS.

499
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,846
- ITALIAN NIGHT
IN JERSEY CITY.

500
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,185
- THERE'S MORE SNOOKI AND JWOWW
ON THE WAY

501
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:01,088
AND IT STARTS RIGHT NOW.

502
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,261
[phone buttons beeping]

503
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:10,597
[line ringing]

504
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,632
SO THIS MORNING
I JUST WANT TO CALL JIONNI

505
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,101
AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE BAR,

506
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,636
BECAUSE JENNI'S REALLY UPSET,
AND OBVIOUSLY I WANNA KNOW

507
00:17:16,636 --> 00:17:18,905
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED.

508
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:20,140
- HELLO?

509
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,608
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

510
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,276
- THANKS.

511
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,978
- WHAT DID YOU DO LAST NIGHT?

512
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,014

513
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,716

515
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,221
WAS THERE GIRLS THERE?

516
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,422

517
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,790
- DID THEY GET--
DID THEY HIT ON YOU?

518
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,193
- NO, NOT ONE PERSON
EVEN, LIKE, CAME UP TO ME.

519
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,495
- WITH JIONNI GOING OUT
TO THE BAR, I MEAN,

520
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:45,132
OBVIOUSLY IT'S DOWN
THE SHORE AND, YOU KNOW,

00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,367
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GONNA
BE GIRLS AT THIS BAR.

522
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,203

00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,413
I DON'T LIKE STALKING JIONNI,
BUT WE'RE ENGAGED NOW,

527
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,382
SO I'M ALLOWED
TO DO THAT.

528
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:05,252
- "ROGER AND SNOOKI'S BOYFRIEND
AT HEMINGWAY'S TONIGHT."

529
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:08,455
CLICK ON HER.

530
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,697
- YOU GOTTA BE [bleep]ING
KIDDING ME, BRO.

531
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,632

00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:28,208
LOOK, THEY'RE,
LIKE, TOUCHING SKIN.

536
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,509
OH, MY GOD,

537
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,411
IF HE'S [bleep]ING
THESE SKANKS.

538
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,613
JIONNI IS IN THE PICTURE
WITH THESE GIRLS

539
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,849
AND HE'S TOUCHING SKINS
WITH ONE OF THE GIRL'S HANDS.

542
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,790

543
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,924
"AND HE'S CUTE AND SWEET.

544
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,025
MARRY ME."

545
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:48,395

546
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,763
STUPID [bleep]ING SLUT.

548
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,901
"HEY, I LIKE YOUR
[bleep]ING MUSCLES."

549
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,370
WHY ARE YOU GOING

550
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,206
WITH RANDOM GIRLS
WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGED

551
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:00,973

00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:15,788
- NO.

560
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:18,225
- DID YOU SAY SOMETHING
TO A GIRL?

561
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,760
LIKE YOU'RE CHECKING HER OUT
AND YOU TOLD HER,

562
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,595
"NICE DRESS,

00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,608
- WELL, ME AND MY COUSIN

570
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,809

571
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,245
- NO, YOUR COUSIN WASN'T

572
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,479
BECAUSE I SEE THE PICTURE,
AND IT'S JUST YOU.

573
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,849
JUST ONE GUY WHO IS YOU
AND FIVE GIRLS AROUND HIM.

574
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,884
LIKE, WHY ARE YOU HAVING
CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE GIRLS

575
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:47,687
WHEN YOU'RE ENGAGED
AND I'M PREGNANT, SLEEPING?

576
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,623
- YOU'RE GETTING MAD AT ME
FOR SOMETHING--FOR NOTHING.

577
00:19:50,623 --> 00:19:52,659
- NO, I'M NOT MAD AT YOU,
I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED

578
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,794
AND I'M, LIKE, QUESTIONING

OUR ENGAGEMENT?

583
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,402
- YEAH, BECAUSE
YOU'RE GOING OUT

584
00:20:02,402 --> 00:20:04,003
AND DOING THESE THINGS
THAT YOU KNOW I HATE.

585
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,338
- YOU WANNA
[bleep]ING SAY,

586
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:06,639
"OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
OUR ENGAGEMENT,"

587
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,874
ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW,
RIGHT HERE?

588
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,309

LIKE HEARING--

589
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,877
- THAT'S [bleep] UP.

590
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,913
I'M WATCHING OUT FOR MYSELF
AND MY BABY, SO THANKS.

591
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,282
- I THOUGHT YOU
WERE DIFFERENT THAN THAT.

592
00:20:15,282 --> 00:20:16,683
I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU WERE READY.

593
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,319
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU WERE READY
TO BE A MOTHER AND A WIFE.

594
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,653
BUT MAYBE YOU'RE NOT.

595
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:24,591
YOU HEAR ONE LITTLE [bleep]ING
RUMOR AND YOU GO NUTS.

"I'M NOT READY."

599
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:35,201
AND I SAID,
"MAYBE YOU'RE NOT READY."

600
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:38,070
HELLO?

601
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,039

602
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,173

603
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,142
- HE SAID I'M NOT READY
TO BE A MOM.

604
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:47,013
- I'M NOT GONNA BEAT
THIS [bleep]ING HORSE ANYMORE!

605
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,214
THIS SUCKER'S DEAD!

606
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,382
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET OVER IT.

607
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:51,183
I'M NOT GOING
TO APOLOGIZE.

608
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,251
STALEMATE.

609
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,119

610
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,354

611
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:57,223
- WHAT THE [bleep]
IS A STALEMATE?
