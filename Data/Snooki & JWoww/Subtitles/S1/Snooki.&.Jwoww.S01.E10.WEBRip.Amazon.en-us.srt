1
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:05,106
- I AM NOT OKAY IN THIS
RELATIONSHIP AT THIS POINT.

2
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:06,374
- YOU SHOULD BE WITH TOM.

3
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:08,309
YOU GUYS WERE PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER.

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,244
- BY TELLING ME THAT
I SHOULD BE WITH MY EX,

5
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,113
YOU CAN GO [bleep] YOURSELF.

6
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,847
- THEY'RE ALL OVER HIM.

7
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,483
I'M, LIKE, QUESTIONING
OUR ENGAGEMENT.

8
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,051
LIKE, ARE YOU READY?

9
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:18,152
- I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
WERE READY

10
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,853
TO BE A MOTHER AND A WIFE.

11
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,657
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT.
- THAT WAS MEAN.

12
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:24,658
[Icona Pop's I Love It ]

13
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,294
- * I DON'T CARE *

14
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:27,561
* I LOVE IT *

15
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:29,763
* I DON'T CARE *

16
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:31,532
* I LOVE IT
I LOVE IT *

17
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,501
* I DON'T CARE *

18
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:36,837
* I LOVE IT *

19
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:38,539
* I DON'T CARE *

20
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,146
- WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

21
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:48,449
- [crying] HE SAID
I'M NOT READY TO BE A MOM.

22
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:50,918
- YOU'RE NOT READY
TO BE ONE?

23
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,953
- IT'S A LOW BLOW
FOR JIONNI TO SAY

24
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:55,589
I'M NOT READY TO BE A MOM.

25
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,358
YOU DON'T SAY THAT.

26
00:00:57,358 --> 00:00:59,727
- DO THEY THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT
TO, LIKE, SAY THESE THINGS?

27
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,295
THAT'S LIKE ROGER SAYING
I ONLY

28
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:03,131
DESERVE TO BE WITH MY EX.

29
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:05,666
[phone ringing]

30
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,168
- HELLO.

31
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:08,402
- WHY YOU HANGING UP ON ME?

32
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,138
THAT'S REAL MATURE.
TALK IT OVER.

33
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:12,640
- NO, DON'T--DON'T SAY
I'M NOT READY TO BE A MOM.

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,242
IT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL.

35
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:15,843
- HEY, I DIDN'T
DO ONE BAD THING TO YOU

36
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,378
FOR YOU TO SAY I'M NOT READY
FOR AN ENGAGEMENT.

37
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,147
MY LITTLE COUSIN ASKED
ME TO TAKE A PICTURE--

38
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:21,249
- WELL, WHICH ONE'S
YOUR LITTLE COUSIN THEN?

39
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:23,851
- I DON'T KNOW.
- [snorts]

40
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,319
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THIS PICTURE IS, NICOLE.

41
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,887
- CAN I SEND IT TO YOU?

42
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,789
BECAUSE WHEN I SEE
[bleep] LIKE THAT, IT'S LIKE,

43
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,491
I DON'T WANNA BE ENGAGED
TO SOMEONE THAT [bleep]

44
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:32,926
DOES THAT AND TAKES PICTURES
WITH RANDOM GIRLS.

45
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,028
- IF I EVER WERE TO SAY
I'M THINKING TWICE

46
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,165
ABOUT THIS ENGAGEMENT,
IT WOULDN'T BE

47
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:38,432
FOR YOU TO SEND
A PICTURE WITH A GUY.

48
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,767
IT WOULD BE
YOU CHEATING ON ME.

49
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,602
THOSE ARE HARSH,
HARSH WORDS.

50
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,337
STOP TRYING TO BE
A [bleep] TOUGH ASS.

51
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,805
YOU WANNA GET MAD AT ME?
FINE.

52
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,374
I TOOK A PICTURE WITH SOMEBODY
WHO WANTED

53
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,075
TO TAKE A PICTURE WITH ME.
I'M SORRY.

54
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,410
I'M VERY, VERY SORRY FOR THAT.
- YEAH, I'M GONNA BE MAD

55
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,711
AT THAT, BECAUSE YOU KNOW
I HATE IT.

56
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,180
- IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

57
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,681
NICOLE, WHEN I'M DONE TALKING,
THEN YOU CAN TALK.

58
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,549
- OKAY, DAD.

59
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,950
- ALL RIGHT, I TOOK
A [bleep] PICTURE

60
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,253
WITH A--WITH A RANDOM GIRL,
VERY SORRY.

61
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,788
IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

62
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,090
- YOU SAID IT WAS
YOUR COUSIN.

63
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,358
- WHAT?

64
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:07,395
- YOU SAID YOU TOOK A PICTURE
WITH YOUR COUSIN.

65
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:09,897
- I--IT COULD'VE BEEN THAT,
YEAH.

66
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,765
- I AM PRAYING TO THE GODS
RIGHT NOW

67
00:02:11,765 --> 00:02:13,434
THAT JIONNI DIDN'T CHEAT.

68
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,836
BECAUSE HE'S, LIKE,
MY WHOLE LIFE RIGHT NOW.

69
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:19,907
SO IF HE CHEATED, ME AND MY BABY
ARE GOING AWAY.

70
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,108
- MY DAY'S RUINED.

71
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,211
MY FIANCÃ‰E,
WHO'S HOLDING MY BABY,

72
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,379
IS QUESTIONING
MY ENGAGEMENT WITH HER.

73
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,780
DO YOU WANNA BE WITH ME?

74
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,249
- YEAH, I WANNA BE WITH
SOMEONE THAT

75
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,751
DOESN'T WANT OTHER GIRLS.
[crying]

76
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,521
- I DON'T WANT OTHER GIRLS,
NICOLE, LIKE, WHAT--

77
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:36,757
- [sniffling]

78
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,392
- YOU'RE MAKING ME OUT
TO BE THE BAD GUY,

79
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,993
AND I'M NOT.
- NO, I'M NOT.

80
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,862
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
HOW I FEEL.

81
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:43,231
[sniffling]

82
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:44,498
- STOP--STOP CRYING.

83
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:47,034
I DON'T LIKE YOU UPSET.

84
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,136
- I'M A VERY EMOTIONAL
PREGNANT LADY RIGHT NOW.

85
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:51,805
AND WHEN I SEE PICTURES
OF HIM WITH, YOU KNOW,

86
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,841
YOUNG, PRETTY GIRLS,
I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW,

87
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,244
"DOES HE MISS BEING SINGLE
AND, YOU KNOW,

88
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:58,946
"MEETING OTHER GIRLS,
OR IS HE TOTALLY FINE

89
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:00,448
WITH ME FOR THE REST
OF HIS LIFE?"

90
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:03,484
- I ASKED YOU TO GET MARRIED
TO YOU FOR A [bleep] REASON.

91
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,118
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I WANNA BE WITH.

92
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,854
YOU'RE THE ONLY WOMAN I WANNA
HAVE MORE KIDS WITH.

93
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,822
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I WANNA LIVE WITH.

94
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:10,958
SORRY I-I TOOK
A [bleep] PICTURE.

95
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,260
I'M VERY SORRY.

96
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,994
I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN,
OKAY?

97
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,596
BUT JUST THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME.

98
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:17,665
YOU RUINED MY WHOLE
ENTIRE [bleep] BIRTHDAY.

99
00:03:17,665 --> 00:03:19,933
MY WHOLE BIRTHDAY, OKAY?

100
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,069
HELLO?
- HERE.

101
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:23,704
- OKAY?

102
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:26,674
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

103
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,281
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH THEM?

104
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:34,682
- I THINK THEY'RE CRAZY.

105
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:36,950
- RIGHT NOW, IT FEELS
LIKE COUPLES HELL.

106
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,752
I MEAN, ME AND JIONNI
ARE FIGHTING.

107
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,821
AND ROGER AND JENNI,
THEY DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW,

108
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:42,590
IF THEY'RE GONNA
BE TOGETHER OR BREAK UP.

109
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,792
AND I JUST WANNA
CURL IN A BALL AND DIE.

110
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:47,728
WELL, NOT DIE,
BUT SLEEP FOREVER.

111
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,065
- WHAT A [bleep]
DEPRESSING DAY.

112
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,734
I FEEL LIKE [bleep]
THIS MORNING.

113
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,804
I'M NOT GETTING OVER WHAT
ROGER SAID TO ME THAT NIGHT.

114
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:59,807
AND I DON'T KNOW
IF WE SHOULD BE TOGETHER.

115
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:03,311
- * LOST IN THIS PLACE *

116
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:07,948
* YOU CAN'T FIND
THE DOOR TO LEAVE *

117
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,484
[phone ringing]

118
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,320
- [whispering]
I'M COMING. I'M COMING.

119
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,687
[phone ringing]

120
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,022
GET THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE.

121
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:17,325
ROGER'S CALLING IN.

122
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:19,660
I LITERALLY WANNA CRY.

123
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,128
WHAT'S UP?

124
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:22,330
- JUST GOT OUT OF WORK.

125
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,764
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
HAVE PLANS OR NOT,

126
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,966
BUT I WOULD LIKE
TO COME UP THERE

127
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,436
SO THAT WE CAN
GET TO THE BOTTOM

128
00:04:28,436 --> 00:04:31,004
OF YOUR ISSUES.

129
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:32,473
JENNI'S EXTREMELY ANGRY
WITH ME.

130
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,207
I'M PRETTY UPSET MYSELF.

131
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,976
SO I DECIDED, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M GONNA GO THERE.

132
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,978
I NEED TO SEE YOU
EYE-TO-EYE AND--

133
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,079
AND FIGURE OUT
WHERE WE STAND.

134
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:40,781
I WILL HEAD UP THERE
AFTER I SHOWER.

135
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,350
AND I'LL SEE YOU
IN A COUPLE HOURS.

136
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,184
- NO.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO?

137
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:45,419
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I WANNA SEE YOU.

138
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,521
- CURRENTLY STILL
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

139
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,790
YOU HAVING ISSUES--
- OH, YOU ARE? YOU ARE?

140
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,258
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE IT.

141
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:52,860
I DON'T DESERVE
TO BE WITH YOU, REMEMBER?

142
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,261
I DESERVE TO BE WITH TOM.

143
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:56,364
I AM THE MOST INSECURE
PERSON IN THE WORLD.

144
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:59,099
- BECAUSE YOU DON'T ADMIT--
- WILL YOU [bleep] LISTEN TO ME?

145
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,001
BECAUSE OUR RELATIONSHIP
IS BASICALLY

146
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,236
ON A [bleep] THREAD RIGHT NOW.

147
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,005
I DO NOT NEED TO HEAR THAT

148
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,174
FROM MY [bleep] BOYFRIEND
OF TWO YEARS,

149
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:10,210
BREAKING ME DOWN,
SAYING THAT I AM ONLY WORTH

150
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,513
ENOUGH TO BE WITH
A PIECE OF [bleep] LIKE TOM

151
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,648
AND NOT GOOD ENOUGH
TO BE WITH YOU.

152
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,116
DO YOU KNOW HOW THAT
MAKES ME FEEL COMING FROM--

153
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,051
I WOULD'VE RATHER HAD
MY JAW SMASHED

154
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,387
IN A THOUSAND PIECES.

155
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,389
YOU WERE A [bleep]
[bleep] TO ME.

156
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:22,556
AND YOU HAVE BEEN.

157
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,625
AND THAT'S WHY
I WON'T TALK TO YOU.

158
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,627
- OKAY, THAT'S FINE.
- AND THAT'S WHY I'M NOT--

159
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:29,229
I'M NOT INTRIGUED
TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

160
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,499
- WHEN I FEEL ATTACKED,
I GO ON THE DEFENSE,

161
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:32,866
AND I [bleep] WIN.

162
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:34,702
- THE ONLY THING
YOU'RE WINNING AT, ROGER,

163
00:05:34,702 --> 00:05:37,471
IS LOSING ME.

164
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,107
- BEFORE WE DECIDE
WHICH DIRECTION WE'RE GOING,

165
00:05:40,107 --> 00:05:42,242
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU.
SEE YOU IN A COUPLE HOURS.

166
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,844
- NO.
- I'M ON MY WAY.

167
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,614
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT
I WILL FIGHT ABOUT EVERY TIME,

168
00:05:46,614 --> 00:05:49,082
THAT I'LL STAND MY GROUND ON
AND YOU CAN'T BULLY ME OVER,

169
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,618
IT WON'T HAPPEN.

170
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,486
I'LL SEE YOU IN A COUPLE HOURS.
- WHY?

171
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:55,456
- I'M ON MY WAY.
- UGH. GOD.

172
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,728
- GET OVER IT, OR NOT!

173
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:01,929
- I'M NOT GETTING INTO THIS!

174
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,196
- I DIDN'T WANNA
GET INTO THIS!

175
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,566
YOU WANTED TO GET INTO THIS!
- SO [bleep] STOP!

176
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,167
- ROGER AND JENNI
ARE SCREAMING OUTSIDE,

177
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,803
AND I'M HONESTLY SCARED.

[ Give Me a Chance
by The Miracals]

179
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,143
- * GIVE ME A CHANCE *

180
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,911
- NOT EVEN CLOSE TO LOOKING
LIKE A HUMAN BEING.

181
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,813
- * I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER *

182
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:24,351
* I'LL NEVER GO
I'LL NEVER GO *

183
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:27,488

[doorbell ringing repeatedly]

185
00:06:29,457 --> 00:06:33,326
- OH, MY GOD,
NOT WITH THE [bleep] BELL.

186
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,328
- HEY.
- HELLO.

187
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:37,064
I DON'T WANNA SEE HIM
AT THIS POINT.

188
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,999
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WANNA
BE WITH HIM AT THIS POINT.

189
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:43,837
LIKE, I HAVE, LIKE, NO FEELINGS
IN ME RIGHT NOW, NOTHING.

190
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,173
- WHERE ARE WE AT?

191
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,608
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

192
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:48,709
- YOU WANT ME
TO ANSWER THAT WHEN

193
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,377
MY BLOOD IS BOILING
RIGHT NOW?

194
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,513
- YEAH. IF WE'RE DONE,
I'M COOL, JUST SAY IT.

195
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,482
- YOU'RE--YOU'RE COOL
WITH IT IF WE'RE DONE,

196
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:57,117
'CAUSE YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY
NO FEELINGS TOWARDS ME.

197
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,986
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.
- BUT NO, YOU'RE ACTING LIKE IT.

198
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,554
- I DO NOT WANT
TO BE WITH SOMEBODY

199
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:04,257
WHO DOESN'T WANT
TO BE WITH ME.

200
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,093
I WOULD NEVER WANT
TO DO THAT.

201
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,095
IF YOU DO NOT WANT
TO BE WITH ME, JENNI,

202
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,064
THEN I HAVE NO OPTION,
BUT TO MOVE ON.

203
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,533
HEY, LET'S BE ADULTS.

204
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,502
I MEAN, YOU WOULD AGREE
THIS ISN'T WORKING OUT, RIGHT?

205
00:07:14,502 --> 00:07:16,537
YOU WOULD AGREE THAT
YOU'RE UNHAPPY, CORRECT?

206
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:19,006
- OH, SO THIS IS WHERE
THE BREAKUP'S COMING?

207
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,708
- WELL, I'M JUST SAYING,
LET'S GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

208
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:23,143
WHAT ARE WE GONNA SIT HERE
AND GO BACK AND FORTH ALL DAY?

209
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,378
- I'M PISSED OFF,
AND I DON'T LIKE YOU.

210
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,947
THAT IS CORRECT.
- OKAY.

211
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,516
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
ME TO DO?

212
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:30,217
- [scoffs]

213
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,119
- YOU SHOULD HAVE AN ANSWER
FOR THAT QUESTION.

214
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,854
IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT
OF A QUESTION.

215
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:35,022
- WHY DO I HAVE TO HAVE
THE PRESSURE

216
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,323
PUT ON ME THAT I HAVE TO--

217
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,125
- BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH THE ISSUE,

218
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,727
AND YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S UNHAPPY.

219
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:42,329
- I ONLY HAVE
ONE ISSUE WITH YOU.

220
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,298
YOU'RE A [bleep] [bleep].

221
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:51,639
- I AM NOT APOLOGIZING
FOR SATURDAY.

222
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,306
ACCEPT IT OR DON'T.

223
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,876
- JEEZ, IT'S LIKE, WHAT DO YOU
[bleep] WANT, ROGER?

224
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,444
- EITHER GET OVER IT,
OR NOT!

225
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,813
- I'M NOT GETTING INTO THIS!
- I DIDN'T WANNA GET INTO THIS!

226
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,382
YOU WANTED TO GET INTO THIS!
- SO [bleep] STOP!

227
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:03,817
- YOU GET OVER IT!

228
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,452
- ROGER AND JENNI
ARE SCREAMING OUTSIDE,

229
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,088
AND I'M HONESTLY SCARED
BECAUSE ROGER,

230
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,890
WHEN HE RAISES HIS VOICE,
HE SOUNDS LIKE

231
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:12,392
A TYRANNOSAURUS REX THAT
JUST WANTS TO EAT EVERYONE.

232
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:14,394
AND RIGHT NOW,
I HAVE TO PEE SO BAD

233
00:08:14,394 --> 00:08:15,663
THAT I JUST WANT THEM
TO STOP FIGHTING,

234
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:16,897
OR GO IN ANOTHER ROOM,

235
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:18,465
SO I CAN RUN
TO THE BATHROOM REAL QUICK.

236
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,167
- YOU CAN'T SEE THAT
YOU HURT MY FEELINGS?

237
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,135
- I NEVER SAID I DIDN'T
HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

238
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,737
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY, ROGER.

239
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,005
- I NEVER SAID THAT
I DIDN'T.

240
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,575
BUT I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY

241
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:29,376
BECAUSE I DID SOMETHING WRONG.
- I TOLD YOU,

242
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,579
AN APOLOGY
ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

243
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,380
- I'M NOT GONNA BEAT THIS
[bleep] HORSE ANYMORE.

244
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,582
THIS SUCKER'S DEAD.

245
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:35,849
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET OVER IT.

246
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,585
I'M NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE.

247
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:38,986
STALEMATE.

248
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:40,487
- WHAT?

249
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:41,822
- IT'S A STALEMATE.

250
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:45,158
- WHAT THE [bleep]
IS A STALEMATE?

251
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,460
COME ON, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE [bleep] STALEMATE IS.

252
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,796
I'M NOT JOKING RIGHT NOW.

253
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:50,864
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR
YOUR WEIRD PHRASES

254
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,299
OR YOUR SAYINGS.

255
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,367
GOD, YOU'RE OLD.
- I AM OLD.

256
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,969
YOU KEEP POINTING
THAT OUT CONSTANTLY.

257
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:57,337
AND I'M PROUD OF MY AGE.

258
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,007
I'D RATHER BE 36 THAN
WHAT I WAS AT 26,

259
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:01,775
ANY DAY OF THE WEEK.

260
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,176
[sighs]

261
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,678
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
OF OUR AGE,

262
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,213
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
I'M A LITTLE OLDER.

263
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,015
BUT I'VE BEEN WITH JENNI
ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW,

264
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:09,449
AND IT FEELS LIKE TEN.

265
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,619
WHAT WE BEEN THROUGH,
IT FEELS LIKE TEN.

266
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,854
- WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE
FOR YOU TO, LIKE,

267
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,823
BREAK DOWN THESE
[bleep] PSYCHOTIC

268
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,257
DEFENSIVE WALLS
THAT YOU HAVE?

269
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,793
- WHAT'S IT GONNA TAKE
FOR YOU TO BE A SECURE WOMAN?

270
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,294
- NOT BEING WITH YOU.
- OKAY.

271
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:25,132
SO BE SINGLE.

272
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:28,068
BE SINGLE,
PULL THE TRIGGER.

273
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,809
- I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE DECISION

274
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,746
IS WHAT I REALLY WANT.

275
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:41,815
[slow music]

276
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,516
* *

277
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:46,053
- I DON'T WANNA LEAVE
THIS RELATIONSHIP, JENNI.

278
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,888
I DON'T WANT TO.

279
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,257
BUT I'M NOT GOING
TO BE ACCUSED

280
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:52,760
OF BEING THIS HORRIBLE
BOYFRIEND THAT I'M NOT.

281
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,862
I'M NOT A HORRIBLE BOYFRIEND.

282
00:09:54,862 --> 00:10:00,868
- * ALL WE HAD *

283
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:04,872
* AND ALL IS GONE *

284
00:10:04,872 --> 00:10:08,776
- SO I'M SORRY IF I CAN'T
MAKE A DECISION IN JERSEY CITY.

285
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,478
BECAUSE MY DECISION AFFECTS ME
MORE THAN IT AFFECTS YOU.

286
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,613
YOU CAN GO BACK TO A LIFE...
- IT DOESN'T AFFECT YOUR--

287
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,816
- THAT YOU'VE HAD FOR 13 YEARS.
I DON'T.

288
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:18,351
- THAT'S SO MINISCULE COMPARED--
- IT ISN'T--

289
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,521
- COMPARED TO WHAT IT DOES
TO YOUR HEART AND MY HEART.

290
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:23,356
IT DOES THE SAME THING.

291
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,093
AND I'M ASKING YOU WHAT YOU NEED
TO MAKE THAT DECISION.

292
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:29,697
FOR ME TO LEAVE,
FOR ME TO GIVE YOU TIME, WHAT?

293
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,932
- I DON'T KNOW.

294
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,466
- YOU CAN'T HELP
WHO YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH.

295
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,069
I FELL IN LOVE WITH JENNI.
[sniffling]

296
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,370
YOU CAN SAY WHAT YOU WANT,
YOU KNOW?

297
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,872
YOU CAN SAY
WE'RE NOT MEANT TO BE.

298
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,440
"THEY--THEY FIGHT TOO MUCH."

299
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,042
IT'S TRUE.

300
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:45,979
BUT, I JUST WANT IT TO WORK,
YOU KNOW?

301
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:51,919
- LIKE I SAID BEFORE,
I MEAN,

302
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,053
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

303
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,023
I DON'T LIKE US.

304
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,900
- I DON'T LIKE YOU.
I DON'T LIKE US.

305
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,135
- OH, OKAY.

306
00:11:08,135 --> 00:11:12,039
OTHER THAN THE NAME CALLING
AND RIDICULING--

307
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,741
AND I LOOK YOU IN THE EYE

308
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,142
AND SINCERELY APOLOGIZE
FOR THAT.

309
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,243
I LOST MY TEMPER.

310
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:17,444
I DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT

311
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:19,046
TO SAY CERTAIN THINGS
THAT I SAID.

312
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,481
BUT I WILL NEVER FEEL
LIKE I DID ANYTHING WRONG

313
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:24,184
SATURDAY NIGHT.

314
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,652
- I LOVE YOU WITH
ALL MY HEART.

315
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:31,658
I INVESTED SO MUCH,
OBVIOUSLY, FOR A REASON.

316
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,494
THAT REASON IS A LITTLE LOST
TO ME RIGHT NOW,

317
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,864
AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
IF I CAN FIND IT AGAIN.

318
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:40,233
I'M SAD ABOUT IT,
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE HIM.

319
00:11:40,233 --> 00:11:41,802
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
GONNA WORK OUT.

320
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:45,172
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M JUST
SITTING HERE BUYING TIME.

321
00:11:45,172 --> 00:11:46,639
BUT IN THE SAME SENSE,
I DON'T KNOW

322
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,311
IF I'M READY FOR
IT TO BE OVER RIGHT NOW.

323
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:53,781
- IT'S ODD, JENNI,
'CAUSE WE HAVE

324
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:56,416
TOTAL OPPOSITE POLAR MINDS,

325
00:11:56,416 --> 00:12:02,455
YET THIS UNDENIABLE
ATTRACTION

326
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,623
FOR EACH OTHER.

327
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,558
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
GOD WAS LIKE,

328
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,027
"HERE YOU GO.
[bleep] YOU."

329
00:12:07,027 --> 00:12:08,996
YOU KNOW?

330
00:12:08,996 --> 00:12:10,430
- YEP.

331
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,533
- YOU CAN MAKE ME HAPPIER
THAN ANY PERSON ON THE PLANET.

332
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:15,268
AND YOU CAN PISS ME OFF
MORE THAN

333
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:19,672
I'VE EVER BEEN PISSED OFF
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

334
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,408
- I'D SAY THE SAME THING.

335
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,709
- I DON'T WANNA LEAVE YOU.

336
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,045
I DON'T WANT TO BE SINGLE.

337
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:29,817
I DON'T WANNA BE AN OLD HERMIT,
YOU KNOW, THAT LIVES ALONE.

338
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,819
I'D LIKE TO HAVE KIDS
ONE DAY.

339
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:36,089
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A LOT
OF GOOD IN ME TO PASS ON.

340
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,826
YOU KNOW?

341
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,160
[grunts]

342
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,394
WHOEVER SAID,
"REAL MEN DON'T CRY,"

343
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:43,396
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT
MOTHER[bleep] RIGHT NOW.

344
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,833
IT'S EITHER LET IT EAT US UP,
AND LET IT RUIN US,

345
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,434
AND WE DO SPLIT UP,

346
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:51,371
OR YOU LET IT GO,
AND I LET IT GO.

347
00:12:53,206 --> 00:12:56,009
- I CAN LET IT GO, BUT
IT DOESN'T MEAN I CAN BE HAPPY.

348
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,577
- I'M RIGHT THERE WITH YA.

349
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,046
I'M RIGHT THERE WITH YA.

350
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,447
TRUST ME.

351
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,714
- MM-HMM.

352
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,750
THIS ARGUMENT
IS GOING IN CIRCLES,

353
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,485
AND NEITHER OF US
ARE BACKING DOWN.

354
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,887
BUT FOR WHATEVER REASON
WITH ROGER,

355
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,622
I JUST CAN'T FEEL LIKE
IT'S OVER YET.

356
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:13,360
I CAN'T TURN THAT
LIGHT SWITCH OFF.

357
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,863
ARE YOU GETTING AN EYE HEADACHE?
- MM-HMM.

358
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:19,933
- MY LEFT EYE'S BEEN POUNDING
FOR [bleep] SIX HOURS.

359
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,936
- I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,
JENNI, THE ONLY WAY

360
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:26,539
I COULD POSSIBLY LOVE YOU MORE
IS IF YOU WERE MUTE.

361
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,009
- [chuckles]
- THAT'S THE ONLY WAY.

362
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,212
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

363
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:33,413
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

364
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:36,583
I'M TRYING TO BE MAD AT YOU.

365
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,285
- IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD ONE,
ACTUALLY.

366
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:39,786
- PRICK.

367
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,089
ROGER MAKES ME LAUGH
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE HIM.

368
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,025
BUT HE DRIVES ME
[bleep] NUTS.

369
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,601
- ARE YOU MAD AT ME?
- NO.

370
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:55,903
- ARE YOU MAD AT JIONNI?

371
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,604
- I'M PREGNANT.
I DON'T NEED THIS [bleep].

372
00:13:57,604 --> 00:13:58,906
- I KNOW.

373
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:01,808
I'M SORRY YOU HAD
TO LISTEN TO ALL THAT.

374
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,078
[exhales]

375
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,779
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
CALL JIONNI.

376
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,281
- AND SAY WHAT?

377
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,917
- THAT HIS PREGNANT FIANCÃ‰E IS
IN BED AND DEPRESSED OVER THIS.

378
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:11,518
- HE'S HEARTBROKEN BECAUSE--
- SO IS SHE.

379
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,020
- WHY CAN'T YOU CALL HIM?

380
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,687
I HATE GETTING INVOLVED
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S RELATIONSHIPS.

381
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,756
GOD KNOWS WE HAVE
ENOUGH ISSUES.

382
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,391
- IT'S 10:00 AT NIGHT.

383
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:20,360
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T
FIX OUR PROBLEMS.

384
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,930
BUT WE'RE ABLE
TO BE "GROWN-UPS"

385
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,966
AND GET AHOLD OF JIONNI
TO SAVE HIS BIRTHDAY.

386
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,334
I KNOW NICOLE'S
SAD IN BED.

387
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,702
AND I DON'T WANT HER
DEPRESSED PREGNANT.

388
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,404
IF SHE REALLY MISSES
JIONNI'S BIRTHDAY,

389
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:32,772
IT'S GONNA EAT HER ALIVE.

390
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,474
- HELLO?

391
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:37,044
- JIONNI, IT'S JENNI.

392
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:39,246
NICOLE HAS BEEN
SLEEPING ALL DAY.

393
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,681
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HER.

394
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,383
SHE'S PROBABLY STARVING.
SHE HASN'T EATEN.

395
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,518
AND I THINK SHE'S VERY
DISTRAUGHT OVER WHAT HAPPENED.

396
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,688
MAYBE IF YOU CAME HERE,
SOMETHING COULD BE RESOLVED.

397
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,790
- JUST SAY IF HE DOESN'T
WANNA COME UP HERE,

398
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,125
WE COULD PROBABLY MAKE
THE LAST COUPLE HOURS

399
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,660
AT HEMINGWAY'S.

400
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,296
[laughs]

401
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:58,431
- SHE'S NUTS.
ALL RIGHT, I'LL COME THERE.

402
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,532
TELL ME YOU'LL
ANSWER THE DOOR.

403
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,401
- I'LL ANSWER, OR SHE WILL

404
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,735
IF I CAN GET HER UP.

405
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,273
- ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE THERE
IN A HALF HOUR.

406
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:07,774
- ALL RIGHT.

407
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:10,610
- THANKS, BYE.
- BYE.

408
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:16,216
I HAVE CRAMPS.

409
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:18,251
- AWESOME, NO SEX.

410
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,295
- I CALLED JIONNI.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD.

411
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:29,997
- YEAH, I WAS GONNA
CALL HIM ANYWAY.

412
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,564
BUT THANK YOU.

413
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,167
- I JUST TOLD HIM
TO GET HERE.

414
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,769
MAYBE WE CAN SALVAGE
HIS BIRTHDAY.

[ Pink Balloons

416
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:40,407
- I FEEL LIKE
WE SHOULD GO OUT NOW.

417
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,810
MAYBE I OVERREACTED BECAUSE
HE JUST TURNED 25.

418
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,913
AND THAT'S, LIKE, A QUARTER
OF YOUR LIFE THAT YOU LIVED.

419
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:49,382
AND, UM, I'M AN [bleep],
AND I RUINED THAT.

420
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:50,583
SO I NEED TO FIX IT.

421

* BRING ME THE SUN
AND MOON *

423
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:01,094
* MAYBE SOME ROSES *

424
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:04,031
* THAT WOULD BE NICE TOO *

425
00:16:04,031 --> 00:16:05,865
- MY BOOBS ARE ENORMOUS.

426
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:09,336
- * AND I'LL BE YOUR
FAVORITE GIRL *

[doorbell rings]

428
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:14,407
- JIONNI'S HERE, NICOLE.

429
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,851
- PUP?
- HI.

430
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,353
- I'M SORRY.

431
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:27,587
- WHY ARE YOU ALL DRESSED UP?

432
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,356
- 'CAUSE IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

433
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:32,192
- * AND WE WILL
FALL IN LOVE *

434
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:33,426
- I'M SORRY.

435
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,162
- I WALK IN, THE FIRST
THING NICOLE SAYS

436
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,064
IS, "I'M SORRY."

437
00:16:37,064 --> 00:16:38,631
THAT FACT THAT SHE SAID
SORRY TO ME

438
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:41,068
IS WHY I LOVE HER, AND
IS WHY WE'RE A STRONG COUPLE,

439
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:43,436
AND IS WHY SHE'S AMAZING.

440
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,671
- ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

441
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,074
- NO, I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

443
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,411
- YOU LOOK CUTE.

LET'S SEE THIS PICTURE.
- HERE IT IS, REAL QUICK.

448
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,297
- THIS IS THE GIRL
YOU SAID LOOKED NICE.

449
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:12,365
LOOK, THEY'RE TOUCHING YOU
WITH THEIR SKINS.

450
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,601
- THAT'S A REAL NICE DRESS.
AW, MAN.

451
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,103
I WOULD BE MAD TOO
IF MY COUSIN

452
00:17:16,103 --> 00:17:17,737
IS IN THE BACKGROUND
IN THE MIDDLE.

453
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:21,841
- [laughs]
- I'D BE--I'D BE REALLY MAD.

454
00:17:21,841 --> 00:17:23,110
- I NEVER MET HER.
- MY COUS--

- YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY BLONDE COUSINS.

456
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,113
- SHE LIVES DOWN THE SHORE.

457
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,115
- GOD, YOU TWO ARE THE MOST
INSECURE HUMAN BEINGS

458
00:17:28,115 --> 00:17:29,616
EVER TO WALK THE FACE
OF THE EARTH, EVER.

459
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:30,683
- YOU GUYS ARE, LIKE,
HOLDING HANDS.

00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,185
THAT'S NOT YOUR COUSIN THOUGH.

461

- HOW'D I GET CALLED INSECURE?

462
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:36,356

WAS OVER A PICTURE

00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,725
OF MY COUSIN AND HER FRIENDS.

464
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,026
REALLY?

465
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,195
- CAN I HAVE A CAB
TO [bleep] STREET

AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR
FOUR PEOPLE TO POWERHOUSE?

467
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,234
- YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

I'D FORGIVE YOU *

* WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT *

* AND THAT I'D HOLD YOUR HAND
AND KISS YOUR ASS *

* AND JUST BLOW IT OFF *

* YOU'RE SMOKING CRACK *

- IS IT REALLY?
- YEP.

477
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,056
- TAKING SHOTS OF PICKLE JUICE
IS BETTER

478
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,958
THAN DOING THE REAL THING
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

YOU KINDA GET
A LITTLE HAPPY,

480
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:16,163
AND THEN YOU DON'T GET
A HANGOVER THE NEXT DAY.

- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PUP.

- TO THROWING
ANOTHER ONE BACK, PAL.

- JENNI, IF YOU GET DRUNK,
WILL ROGER GET LUCKY TONIGHT?

489
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,849
- NEVER, DUDE, THERE'S
ZERO CHANCE OF ME GETTING LAID.

490
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,851
- WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
OF ROGER GETTING LUCKY?

491
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,987
- ZERO.

492
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,589
- HE'S SLEEPING ON THE COUCH.

493
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,890

I KNOW ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT
THE CHANCE

495
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:47,093
OF ME GETTING LAID IS ZERO.

496
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:49,962
- I'M REALLY OVER THE FACT
THAT ROGER

497
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,199
DOESN'T GET SEX FROM JIONNI.

505
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,883
- WHAT WAS IT AGAIN?

506
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:12,419
- ROGER'S GETTING LAID.

507
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,687
- NO. NO CHANCE, BRO,
NO CHANCE.

508
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,623
I HAVE A BETTER CHANCE,
HONESTLY,

509
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,692
OF NEGOTIATING A [bleep]
GAY DEAL WITH YOU

510
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,595
IN THE BATHROOM
THAN I DO WITH HER.

511
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,231
- THAT'S A VERY GOOD SHOT.

512
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,766
[laughter]

513
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:28,301
- I LOVE YOU.

514
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,536
[laughter]

515
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:30,903
- AH-HA.
- WHOO-HOO!

516
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,339
[cheers and applause]

517
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,507
all: HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

518
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,777
[cheers and applause]

519
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:39,979
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

520
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,682
[laughs]
HE'S SO MAD.

521
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,853
- CATCH MY HAIR ON FIRE.

522
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,655
- PROUD OF YOU, BUDDY.

523
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:50,056
- WHY?
- 'CAUSE HE CAME UP HERE.

524
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,558
I DIDN'T THINK HE WAS COMING.

525
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:53,260
- I'M PROUD OF YOU TOO.

526
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,262
- I WASN'T COMING UP.
- DID IT TURN OUT

527
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,029
TO BE WORTH IT?
- YES.

528
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,765
- YEAH, 'CAUSE I DID
ALL YOUR DIRTY WORK.

529
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,300
- I WANTED TO COME UP.

530
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,768
- I THINK IT WOULD'VE
BEEN TOO MUCH,

531
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:04,070
TWO FIGHTS GOING ON
AT THE SAME TIME.

532
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,272
- I WOULDN'T HAVE
FOUGHT WITH HIM.

533
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:06,673
- AT ALL, PERIOD?

534
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:09,041
'CAUSE YOU TRUST HIM
AND YOU'RE SECURE?

535
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,545
- 'CAUSE I REALIZED I MAYBE
OVERREACTED A LITTLE BIT.

536
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:16,148
[laughter]

537
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,551
- I'M GLAD I CAME.
- ME TOO.

538
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,487
- I'M GLAD JENNI CALLED ME.

539
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:22,389
- I WAS GONNA CALL YOU!

540
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:23,556
ANNOYING.

541
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,493
- [mouthing]
NO, SHE WASN'T.

542
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:36,903
- FAKE BABY TIME.

543
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,639
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
GETTING NICOLE A FAKE BABY,

544
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,409
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE SHE SHOULD
PREP FOR MOTHERHOOD.

545
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,010
- IS THIS A [bleep] BABY?

546
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,145
EW, IT HAS A WIENER!

547
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,814
SO TODAY IS MY APPOINTMENT,

548
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:49,616
AND I'M VERY EXCITED
BECAUSE I'M GONNA

549
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:51,584
ASK THE DOCTOR
IF HE CAN TELL THE SEX.

550
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,952
CAN YOU SEE?

551
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,220
DO YOU GUYS WANNA
KNOW WHAT IT IS, OR--?

552
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,656
both: YEAH.
