00:00:03,204 --> 00:00:05,005
- I KINDA WANNA
GET MY OWN PLACE WITH JENNI.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,274
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

3
00:00:06,274 --> 00:00:07,575
- NICOLE'S A HANDFUL.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

4
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:08,742
IT'S GONNA BE CRAZY.

5
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,744
- IS THIS IT?
- IS THIS A GARAGE?

6
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:12,146
- SO WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK
OF THE OPEN FEELING THOUGH?

7
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,447
- I LOVE THIS PLACE.

8
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:16,750
- SO BEFORE WE GET
ALL SERIOUS AND SIGN THE LEASE,

9
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,053
I REALLY NEED
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

10
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:21,789
SO JIONNI PROPOSED.

11
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,525
AND I'M PREGNANT.

12
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,195
- * I DON'T CARE *

13
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:28,662
* I LOVE IT *

14
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,598
* I DON'T CARE *

15
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:32,466
* I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT *

16
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,702
* I DON'T CARE *

17
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:37,705
* I LOVE IT *

18
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,707
* I DON'T CARE *

19
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,776
[pop music playing]

20
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:46,414
* *

21
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,849
- UM--

22
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:51,685
SO HE PRETTY MUCH
ASKED ME TO GET MARRIED

23
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:56,157
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

24
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:58,226
LIKE, THREE MONTHS.

25
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,798
- WHAT DO I SAY?

26
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,534
- I'M PREGNANT.

27
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:09,537
AND ENGAGED.

28
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,305
WILL YOU BE THE GODMOTHER?

29
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:13,841
- OH, MY GOD!
REALLY?

30
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:15,809
- YEAH.

31
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,513
- NO. AWW.

32
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:21,449
I'M SHAKING.

33
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:24,852
I CAN'T PROCESS WHAT NICOLE
IS TELLING ME RIGHT NOW.

34
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:27,888
I WANNA BE SO HAPPY FOR HER,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

35
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:29,723
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GETTING MYSELF INTO.

36
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:31,159
- SO DO YOU WANNA
GET THIS PLACE?

37
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,426
[chuckles]

38
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,961
- COME WITH ME.

39
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,396
- I'M DEFINITELY NERVOUS THAT

40
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,864
JENNI'S NOT GONNA WANNA
LIVE WITH ME.

41
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,432
I REALLY WANNA DO THIS,
BECAUSE

42
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,234
IT'S THE ONLY TIME
I CAN DO IT--

43
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,469
LIKE, LITERALLY.

44
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,636
- JESUS [bleep].

45
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,805
THIS IS MORE OF A DECISION
FOR YOU THAN ME.

46
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,640
- YOU KNOW MY DECISION.

47
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,709
YES, I LOVE THIS PLACE.
LET'S GET IT.

48
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:51,279
- PREGNANT AND ENGAGED NICOLE

49
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:53,181
SEEMS LIKE SHE'S
ALL ABOUT IT.

50
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:55,483
BUT I'M TRYING TO HOLD ON
TO MY TWENTIES.

51
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,185
AM I GONNA TURN
INTO HER MOM

52
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,619
THAT BRINGS HER
TO HER DOCTORS

53
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,754
AND HOLDS HER HAIR WHILE
SHE'S THROWING UP?

54
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,790
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW
HOW PREGNANT CHICKS ACT.

55
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,991
- THIS IS GONNA BE
REALLY FUN.

56
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,826
SO DON'T THINK IT'S NOT
GOING TO BE.

57
00:02:05,826 --> 00:02:07,195
- I TRUST YOU.

58
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,629
I'M SURE YOU CAN
MAKE ANYTHING FUN.

59
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,198
I'M SURE IF WE WERE
IN A JAIL CELL--

60
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:11,565
- IT WOULD BE A BLAST,
EVEN IF I HAD

61
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,201
TWO KIDS ON MY ARM.

62
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,302
- SO YOU WANNA DO THIS?

63
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,736
- YES.

64
00:02:15,736 --> 00:02:17,871
[burps]

65
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,108
- SO WHAT DID YOU GUYS--

66
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:22,610
WHAT'S THE CONCLUSION?

67
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,044
- WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT!

68
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,214
- NICE.

00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:28,282
- CONGRATULATIONS.

70
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:30,083
- CHEERS.

71
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,720
IT'S NOT CHAMPAGNE,
BUT IT'LL DO.

72
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,922
- SO ALL YOU GUYS NEED
TO DO NOW IS JUST INITIAL--

73
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,958
- ALL THREE?
- ALL THREE.

74
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,660
- I MEAN, HONESTLY,
I DON'T EVEN READ

75
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,062
THE FRICKIN' PAPERS,
WHICH IS REALLY BAD.

76
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,232
- CONGRATULATIONS.
both: THANK YOU.

77
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:45,266
- GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING.

78
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,534
- YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT
THIS PLACE.

79
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,236
I JUST WANNA MOVE IN WITH JENNI
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

80
00:02:48,236 --> 00:02:51,472
- DON'T FORGET THE LEASE.

81
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,806
- OH, YEAH.
- I DON'T WANT IT.

82
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,074
- I HAVE TO SHOW
MY DAD THIS,

83
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,076
'CAUSE I WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO SIGN IT.

84
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,445
AND I KNOW MY DAD'S GONNA
KILL ME,

85
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:58,746
BECAUSE I'M NOT EVEN
CALLING HIM TO SAY

86
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:00,514
I'M SIGNING THE LEASE.

87
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,916
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S A NEW STEP
IN MY NEW LIFE.

88
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,385
- SEE YA TOMORROW?

89
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:07,355
- YEAH.

90
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,296
- AAH!

91
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:16,464
[bleep]

92
00:03:16,464 --> 00:03:18,366
OKAY, I'M GOOD.

[techno music]

94
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,935
- * OH, MY GOD *

95
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,473
* *

96
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:27,308
- SO WE LOOKED AT HOUSES.

97
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:31,579
FOUND THIS ONE
THAT WE REALLY LIKED...

98
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:33,281
AND WE SIGNED PAPERS

99
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,383
AND WE'RE MOVING IN TOMORROW.
- WHAT?

100
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,751
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU SIGNED THE PAPERS?

101
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,288
- WE'RE MOVING IN TOMORROW.

102
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:42,523
- I THOUGHT WHEN WE LEFT YOU
WERE NOT GONNA SIGN ANYTHING.

103
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:43,791
WE WERE GONNA WORK IT OUT.

104
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:47,160
OH, THAT'S TERRIFIC.
- OKAY, SO--

105
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,629
HOW LONG DID YOU
SIGN THE LEASE FOR?

106
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,298
- [sighs] OH, BOY.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

107
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:52,300
- WHAT KINDA HEAT
IS IN IT?

108
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,468
OIL? GAS?
- WE DIDN'T ASK.

109
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,636
- YOU DIDN'T ASK?
- ELECTRIC?

110
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,137
- I DON'T KNOW.

111
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,706
WE JUST SAID,
"WE'LL TAKE IT."

112
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,342
- [chuckles]

113
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,210
- WELL--
- THAT'S IT.

114
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,313
- I REALLY WISH
YOU WOULD'VE CALLED ME.

115
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:07,481
- MY DAD'S MAKING
ALL THESE FACES.

116
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,082
AND I'M LIKE,
"DAD, IT'S FINE.

"LIKE, STOP BEING
SO INVESTIGATOR.

EVERYTHING'S GONNA
BE FINE."

IT'S TIME TO GROW UP.
- UH, YEAH.

120
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,223
- YOU KNOW,
I REALLY DON'T CARE.

121
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:18,225
LIKE, NO OFFENSE, DAD,
BUT I'M DOING THIS

122
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,560
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT
OR NOT.

123
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,062
GOOD NIGHT.

124
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,564
DON'T WAKE ME UP.

125
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,033
- [laughs]

126
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,401
- SHE IS JUST, LIKE--

127
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,371

130
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:39,980
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

131
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,350
- WE FOUND A REALLY
NICE PLACE.

132
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,384
- YOU FOUND ONE.
WHERE IS IT?

133
00:04:43,384 --> 00:04:45,252
JERSEY CITY STILL?
- JERSEY CITY.

134
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,356
AND THEN, UM--

135
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:50,123
SOMEBODY'S KNOCKED UP.

136
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,892
- WHAT?

137
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:56,397
- NICOLE HAD TO TELL ME
THAT SHE'S PREGNANT.

138
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:58,165
- GET THE [bleep]
OUT OF HERE.

139
00:04:58,165 --> 00:04:59,400
- I ALMOST THREW UP
ON MYSELF.

140
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,168
AND JIONNI PROPOSED
TO HER LAST MONTH.

141
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,704
- GET THE [bleep]
OUT OF HERE, SERIOUSLY.

142
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,038
- I WANNA HAVE AN EXPERIENCE
WITH HER BEFORE

143
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,173
SHE HITS HER THIRD TRIMESTER.

144
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:08,208
- SHE'S PREGNANT.
- YES.

145
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,643
- HOW ARE YOU GONNA
HAVE ANY FUN?

146
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,779
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TAKE
[bleep] LAMAZE CLASS WITH HER?

147
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,714
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

148
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:15,883
JENNI SPRINGS THIS ON ME,

149
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,418
AND TELLS ME NICOLE
IS NOW PREGNANT.

150
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,487
AND SHE'S STILL GOING THROUGH
WITH THIS MOVE.

151
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,854
AM I IN THE [bleep]
TWILIGHT ZONE?

152
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,189
THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

153
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,757
IF NICOLE IS DRIVING
YOU BONKERS

154
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,158
AND YOU CAN'T TAKE IT,
DON'T CALL ME CRYING.

155
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,495
YOU MADE THE CHOICE.

156
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,397
- DON'T MAKE ME
TWIST YOUR NIPPLE.

157
00:05:29,397 --> 00:05:30,598
- DON'T TOUCH MY TITTIES.

158

LIKE, I'M LEGIT MOVING IN

161
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,238
WITH A CHICK THAT'S
PREGNANT AND ENGAGED.

162
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:39,540
IS THAT WHAT I WANT?

163
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,409
- WHY DOES SHE DO THAT TO US?
THAT'S OKAY.

164
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,310
YOU LEAVING ME TOO?

165
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,712

DO I STINK?

167
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,050
JENNI, I'M PUTTING IN
AN OFFICIAL REQUEST

168
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,686
FOR JIONNI'S BACHELOR PARTY.

00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,755
I DON'T WANT NO DIRTY SKANK
GRINDING ON HIM.

170
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:55,923
- WHY ARE YOU COOL
WITH IT THEN?

171
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,758
- HE WOULD LEAVE ME
IF I WAS LIKE THAT.

172
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:00,794
- [laughing]

173
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,808

- WHO IS IT?

177
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,451
- GOOD MORNING.

178
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:25,018
YOU TOLD JENNI?
- MM-HMM.

179
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,020
- IS SHE EXCITED?

180
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,489
- I THINK.

181
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:29,557
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU THINK?

182
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,191
HOW WAS HER REACTION?

183
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,461
- "YOU'RE LYING.
SHUT UP."

184
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:35,829
SHE GOT, LIKE, CONCERNED.

185
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:38,065
SHE THINKS WE'RE TOO YOUNG,
I FEEL.

186
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,733
- NO.

187
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,368
WE'LL SHOW HER WE'RE READY.

188
00:06:41,368 --> 00:06:43,471
HOW'S MY LITTLE--
LET ME SEE.

189
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,105
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN.
- STOP TOUCHING!

190
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,474
- IT'S MY--

191
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:48,609
- WAIT TILL IT'S LARGE
AND IN CHARGE.

192
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,678
JIONNI THINKS IT'S OKAY
TO START

193
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,846
RUBBING MY STOMACH
AND POKING IT.

194
00:06:52,846 --> 00:06:54,114
BUT AT THIS STAGE
IN THE PREGNANCY,

195
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,315
IT'S ONLY THREE MONTHS.

196
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:57,150
SO IT'S CREEPY.

197
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,652
- GET UP SLOW.

198
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:01,689
- YOU'RE SO ANNOYING.

199
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,026
- BABE.
- WHAT'S UP?

200
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,496
- YOUR CAR'S LEAKING
ANTIFREEZE OR SOMETHING.

201
00:07:08,496 --> 00:07:10,097
SEE?

202
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,231
IT'S, LIKE, A PUDDLE
UNDER THERE.

203
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,900
IT'S A BRAND-NEW CAR.

204
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,902
- MY CAR IS LEAKING
SOMETHING.

205
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,203
LIKE, REALLY?

206
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,538
GO [bleep] FIGURE.

207
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,806
CAN I DRIVE IT?

208
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,373
- NO, YOU CAN'T DRIVE IT.

209
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,709
- IT'S, LIKE, A BAD OMEN.

210
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,110
IT'S LIKE GOD'S TELLING ME

211
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,745
I SHOULDN'T BE GOING TO
MOVE IN WITH HER.

212
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,346
SHOULD I EVEN BE MOVING
RIGHT NOW?

213
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:28,916
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A SIGN.

214
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,784
DID I USE THAT WORD RIGHT?

215
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,985
- OMEN?
- YEAH.

216
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,521
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

217
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:37,057
- JUST KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T
DRIVE IT LIKE THAT.

218
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,626
- I'M JUST THROWING STUFF
IN BAGS.

219
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,861
- JIONNI IS, LIKE, THE BEST
WHEN IT COMES

220
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,362
TO HELPING ME OUT
WITH THINGS.

221
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,564
NO, NO, NO, NO.

222
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,533
THE NICE BLOUSES
GO IN THAT.

223
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,034
OH, WAIT, W-W--

224
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,368
NO, NO, NO.

225
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,137
THANK GOD.

226
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,806
BECAUSE I WOULD FREAK OUT
IF I HAD TO DO ALL THIS MYSELF.

227
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,108
THAT'S NOT WHERE YOU PUT--
- OH, MY GOD.

228
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,445
IS THIS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU GET MARRIED?

229
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,180
- THIS SUCKS.

230
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,049
- BABE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO TELL YA.

231
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,283
I MEAN, IT'S GOTTA
GET FIXED.

232
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,118
YOU CAN'T DRIVE IT LIKE THAT,
SO--

233
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,454
- TOMORROW'S MY BIRTHDAY
AND I'M GONNA HAVE NO CAR.

234
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:09,557
- YOU HAVE NICOLE.
SHE HAS A CAR.

235
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:10,858
YOU WANT ME TO CALL 'EM?

236
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,059
- YEAH, I DIDN'T EVEN
INVITE THEM

237
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:13,426
TO MY BIRTHDAY PARTY YET,

238
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,895
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL
INVITE 'EM FOR ME.

239
00:08:14,895 --> 00:08:16,630
[phone ringing]

240
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,166

THAT'S AWESOME, MAN.
I'M HAPPY.

244
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,373
- WHAT'S THE OVER-UNDER ON HIM
BEING FIVE FOOT?

245
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:31,579
- WHAT'S THE OVER-UNDER ON BEING
FOUR FOOT IS MORE LIKE IT.

246
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:34,114
HE'S GONNA HAVE
GODZILLAARMS.

247
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,049
[laughter]

248
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,450
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.

249
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,419
MY BABY'S NOT GONNA HAVE
THESE KIND OF ARMS.

250
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,688
HE'S GONNA BE NORMAL.

251
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,790
- SHE'S 4'8".
I'M 4'10", SO--

252
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,625
[laughter]

253
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,959
- ALL RIGHT,
RELAX OVER THERE.

254
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,461
UM, LISTEN, I GOTTA
RUN SOMETHING BY YOU.

255
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,898
UH, JENNI'S BIRTHDAY
IS TOMORROW.

256
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,933
SHE WANTS TO GO OUT TO DINNER
WITH YOU AND NICOLE.

257
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,636
- UH, FOR YOU, ROG, WHY NOT?

258
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:58,005
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- I WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

259
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,107
- ALL RIGHT, LATER.
SO WE GOT IT FIGURED OUT.

260
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:01,341
THERE'S THE PLAN.

261
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,643
LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

262
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,311
I WAS JUST THINKING THOUGH,
THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION.

263
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:07,014
YOU COULD TAKE
MY WORK TRUCK.

264
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,616
YOU CAN'T DRIVE A STICK,
BUT I COULD TEACH YOU.

265
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,951
- ROGER'S LIKE, "LET ME TRY
AND TEACH YOU STICK.

266
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,219
YOU CAN DO THIS."

267
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,921
JESUS, MANUAL LOCKS
AND EVERYTHING?

268
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,623
- IT'S OLD-SCHOOL LIKE ME.

269
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,290
YOUR KEY GOES IN THERE.
- YEAH.

270
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,626
WHY WON'T IT START?

271
00:09:18,626 --> 00:09:19,860
- 'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO PUSH
THE CLUTCH HERE

272
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,161
TO TAKE IT OUT OF GEAR.

273
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,295
TAKE THE EMERGENCY BRAKE OFF.

274
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,496
KEEP YOUR FOOT ON THE BRAKE.

275
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:24,732
PUSH THE CLUTCH IN.
PUT IT IN FIRST GEAR.

276
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:25,833
YOU KNOW WHERE
FIRST GEAR IS?

277
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:26,967
- THERE?

278
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,335
- LET OUT ON THE CLUTCH
REAL SLOWLY.

279
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,137
YOU'LL START TO FEEL IT--
EASY.

280
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,906
JESUS.
PUSH THE CLUTCH IN.

281
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,407
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.
THAT'S MUCH BETTER.

282
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,943
MUCH BETTER.

283
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:37,277
JESUS!
- I'M GOING.

284
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,046
[laughing]
OH, IT'S GOING. IT'S GOING.

285
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:40,513
- ARE YOU SERIOUS
RIGHT NOW?

286
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:41,982
- NO.
- WAS THAT A JOKE?

287
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,316
- I WAS, UH--

288
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,653
- TAKE YOUR FOOT OFF THE BRAKE.
PUT IT ON THE GAS.

289
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,054
AND LET OUT ON THE CLUTCH--
EASY.

290
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,488
OH, MY GOD, GIRL, EASY--

291
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,657
UGH, THAT'S EASY?

292
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:51,291
- MY SHOE--

293
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,460
THE HARD PART
OF DRIVING STICK IS TRYING

294
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,963
TO CONCENTRATE ON
THE CLUTCH AND THE THING.

295
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,666
- ALL RIGHT,
SO I'M TAKING YOU NOW.

296
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,234
'CAUSE THAT WAS BRUTAL.

297
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:02,836
- [laughs sarcastically]

298
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,237
- [grunts]
- WHAT'S IN THAT?

299
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,039
I ALWAYS, LIKE, PACK INSIDE--
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

300
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,942
THERE'S, LIKE, STUFF FROM
YOUR LAST TRIP OR SOMETHING.

301
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,011
- UH--
- I DON'T KNOW.

302
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,512
AAH!
JESUS CH--

303
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,882
- [laughing]

304
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:17,084
- POOR BABY.

305
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,986
[high-pitched voice]
WHAT ARE WE DOING IN THERE?

306
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,621
IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE LEAVING HIM.

307
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,556
- SHOULD I JUST START LOOKING
FOR A NEW GIRLFRIEND NOW?

308
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,658
OR--
- NO, YOU CAN WAIT

309
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:25,926
A COUPLE WEEKS.

310
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,260
- ANYTHING ELSE
I SHOULD KNOW?

311
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,029
- UM, I'M PREGNANT.

312
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,430
- RIGHT.

313
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,732
I KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

314
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,200
I TRY TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU
SIX TIMES A DAY

315
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,702
AND I GET DENIED CONSTANTLY.

316
00:10:34,702 --> 00:10:36,704
- SAVING IT FOR
MY NEW BOYFRIEND.

317
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:38,906
- LET'S BREAK UP
FOR, LIKE, 15 MINUTES.

318
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,440
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE
MAKE UP SEX BEFORE YOU GO.

319
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,574
AND WE'LL GET BACK TOGETHER.

320
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:44,077
- NO, I GOT MY PERIOD.
- UGH!

321
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:52,219
- WE'RE GONNA BE TIGHT.

322
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,021
- OKAY, WELL, I HAVE
THREE MORE LUGGAGES.

323
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:55,255
CAN WE FIX IT?

324
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:56,757
WANT ME TO GO IN?
I'LL GO IN.

325
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,025
- I'LL GET IT.

326
00:10:58,025 --> 00:11:02,129
YOU'RE GONNA HURT YOURSELF.

327
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,597
- MY TRUCK IS DEFINITELY
FOR NORMAL SIZE PEOPLE,

328
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,266
OVER, LIKE, 5'5".

329
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,635
- [laughs] WILL YOU
GET YOUR HANDS OFF MY ASS?

330
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,470
- NO, AND I'LL PULL YOU
BACK OUT.

331
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,939
GOD.

332
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:13,741
LIKE, LEGIT, WE LOOK LIKE
LITTLE [bleep]

333
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:17,577
TRYING TO PACK MY TRUCK
RIGHT NOW.

334
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:20,513
THAT'S SOME [bleep]
PROBLEMS FOR YOU.

335
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,550
- [sighs]

336
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,486
- YOU NERVOUS?
- YEAH.

337
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,857
- HOLY [bleep].
DID YOU JUST HEAR THAT?

338
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:31,291
ALL THE WEIGHT IN YOUR TRUNK
JUST MADE

339
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,860
MY REAR END BOTTOM OUT.

340
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,194
THAT WAS MY TIRE.

341
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,163
IF THAT RIPPED MY TIRE UP,
I'M GONNA FLIP OUT.

342
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,264
- [chuckles]

343
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,332
THIS IS CRAZY.

344
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,668
GOD IS SAYING
EVERY WHICH WAY,

345
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:45,405
"DON'T [bleep] GO LIVE
WITH A PREGNANT CHICK."

346
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:48,475
[hip-hop music]

347
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:49,910
* *

WITH EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENED TODAY,

353
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,055
I MAKE IT BEFORE NICOLE.

354
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,791

355
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,158
- [burps]

356
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:07,828
- JENNI'S NOT SO MUCH
A HANDS-ON GIRL, YOU KNOW?

357
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,162
THANK GOD SHE'S GOT
A HANDS-ON BOYFRIEND.

358
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,630
- IT'S A LOT OF WORK,
MOVING.

359
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,633
- I KNOW.
LET'S GO GET THE REST OF IT.

YO!

361
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,272

00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:24,177
I LIKE YOUR CAR, IT'S THE FIRST
TIME I'VE SEEN IT.

366
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,445
WHERE'S JIONNI?
- HOME.

367
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:26,679
- SO IT MEANS I GOTTA BRING
ALL YOUR [bleep] IN TOO?

368
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,915
- CAN YOU?
- OH, MY GOD.

369
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,250
- I WAS SO SCARED TO ASK JENNI,
BUT NOW YOU CAN.

370
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,418
ARE YOU GONNA DO IT NOW?

371
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,619
- UH, YEAH, YEAH.

372
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:34,988
- HELLO?

373
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,223
- FINALLY.

374
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,058
- DID JIONNI COME WITH YOU?
- NO.

375
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,228
- NO?
- THIS IS A BAD PREGNANCY DAY.

376
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,030
- OH, I'M DEFINITELY CALLING
JIONNI WHEN I GET OUT HERE.

377
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,965
I'M GONNA REAM HIM
OUT [bleep].

378
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,067
- I THINK ROGER'S
A LITTLE ANNOYED

379
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,602
BECAUSE JIONNI'S NOT HERE
TO HELP HIM WITH THE LUGGAGE.

380
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,039
BUT, UM, YOU KNOW,
[bleep] HAPPENS.

381
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,074
I TOLD JENNI,
SHE SHOULD GET PREGNANT,

382
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,742
BECAUSE THEN WE COULD
BE PREGNANT TOGETHER.

383
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:57,444
- OH, MY GOD.
- HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

384
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,611
- NOW YOU'RE SCARING ME.

385
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,980
I MEAN, YOUR SPERM
IS GETTING REALLY OLD.

386
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,248
SO YOU SHOULD JUST
DO IT SOON.

387
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,850
I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
A CERTAIN AGE

388
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,651
WHERE YOUR SPERM WON'T WORK

389
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,553
AND PREGNANT SOMEONE.

390
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,121
- WOW.

391
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,890
- SO I FEEL LIKE
HE SHOULD GET ON THAT.

392
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,324
- YOU'D HAVE TO CONVINCE
THIS GIRL

393
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,393
TO LET ME PUT MY PENIS
ANYWHERE NEAR HER

394
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,928
BEFORE WE COULD
HAVE A CHILD.

395
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,529
SHE'S ANTI-SEX.

396
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,866
- I'M ANTI-SEX NOW TOO.
- ARE YOU REALLY?

397
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,300
- WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX
IN, LIKE, A WEEK.

398
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,303
AND THAT'S LONG FOR US.

399
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,575
- WE'RE GOING ON JUST OVER
A YEAR NOW.

00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,143
- YEAH, RIGHT.

401
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,879

BUT I THINK MY GIRL'S GONNA
BE TAKING CARE OF YOU.

BE THE LAST TIME I HEAR THAT.

00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,803

415
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,242

00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:57,510
- YES, PLEASE.
- FOR SHIRLEY.

521
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,678
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

522
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,247
- TO THE THREE OF US DRINKING.

523
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:04,151
- WHERE'S MY SHIRLEY TEMPLE,
BITCHES?

524
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:06,153
- LISTEN--
- YOUR KID HAS ZERO CHANCE

525
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:08,054
OF BEING A PROFESSIONAL
BASKETBALL PLAYER.

526
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,156
- OH, YEAH.
- [laughing]

527
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:10,523
- ZERO.

528
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:12,225
- NICOLE.
- ROGER, SHUT UP.

529
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,461
- I'M BEING HONEST.
I'M BEING HONEST.

530
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:16,729
- YEAH, I MEAN,
ROGER ALWAYS GOES THERE.

531
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,598
BUT, YOU KNOW, DON'T FREAKING
TALK ABOUT MY BABY.

532
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,600
I'LL [bleep] SLICE
YOUR PENIS OFF.

533
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,869
- IF YOUR KID'S TALL,
I'LL TAKE A PATERNITY TEST.

534
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,337
- YEAH, RIGHT.
- [laughs]

535
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,339
- ROGER, I HOPE YOU
HAVE A KID LIKE SIMON BIRCH,

536
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,940
YOU [bleep].

537
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,776
OH, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

538
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:32,545
- I LOOK LIKE A MOM.

539
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:36,216
THIS IS MY LIFE NOW.

540
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,850
COOL.

541
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,253
- READY FOR
THE BACHELOR PARTY?

542
00:18:40,253 --> 00:18:42,088
- [laughs]

543
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:44,023
YOU BETTER--YOU BETTER
START ASKING FOR PERMISSION

544
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,092
RIGHT NOW.
FOR ME, NOT FOR YOU.

545
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:48,628
JENNI, I'M PUTTING IN
AN OFFICIAL REQUEST RIGHT NOW

546
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,197
FOR JIONNI'S BACHELOR PARTY.

547
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,764
- IT'S IN VEGAS.
- NO.

548
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,200
- BUT WE'RE GONNA
BE IN VEGAS TOO.

549
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,367
- JENNI?
- WHAT?

550
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:57,670
- CAN ROGER COME?

551
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,006
- SEE THAT?
THAT'S REAL LIFE RIGHT THERE.

552
00:19:00,006 --> 00:19:03,643
WHAT IS IT THAT
BOTHERS YOU SO IF I WENT?

553
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,711
LIKE, WHY WOULD IT
BE A BIG DEAL?

554
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,012
- I DON'T WANT SOME GIRL

555
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,580
SHOVING HER [bleep]
IN YOUR FACE.

556
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,848
- SEE?
- I KNOW WHAT GOES DOWN

557
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,116
AT BACHELOR PARTIES.

558
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:11,684
I DON'T LIKE IT.

559
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,720
I DON'T WANT NO DIRTY SKANK
GRINDING ON HIM

560
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,222
AT JIONNI'S BACHELOR PARTY.

561
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:16,356
NO OFFENSE.
- UGH.

562
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,557
WELL, NO OFFENSE?
I DON'T WANT ANYONE

563
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:19,426
GRINDING ON MY MAN EITHER.

564
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:22,028
- GUYS GET GRIMY ASS STRIPPERS
COMING

565
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,996
TO THEIR BACHELOR PARTY.
- SEE?

566
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,532
- I'M SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE,
"OH, YOU'RE GOING THERE

567
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:27,467
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA
HAVE [bleep] IN YOUR FACE."

568
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,036
THERE IS NOTHING GOOD THAT
COMES FROM BACHELOR PARTIES.

569
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,839
PEOPLE GET DIVORCES BEFORE
THEY GET MARRIED

570
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,073
ON BACHELOR PARTIES.

571
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:35,475
LIKE, WEDDINGS DON'T HAPPEN

572
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:36,809
BECAUSE OF BACHELOR PARTIES.

573
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:39,712
- [bleep] PARANOIA.
- WHY IS THAT PARANOIA?

574
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:42,249
- FORGET I ASKED.
- THAT'S--THAT'S TRUTH.

575
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,550
THAT'S FACTS.

576
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,253
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO [bleep]
OUT TO THE DINER

577
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:48,288
AND HANGING OUT AND
GETTING A CLASS OF ORANGE JUICE.

578
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,522
- IF THAT HAPPENED TO YOU--
IT COMES DOWN

579
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,258
TO TRUST, FOR STARTERS.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

580
00:19:51,258 --> 00:19:53,326
IT'S STILL DISRESPECT.
- COMES DOWN TO TRUST.

581
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,428
- JENNI'S A PSYCHO BITCH
FOR A GIRLFRIEND.

582
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,564
SHE'S JUST LIKE, "ROGER,
YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

583
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,765
"YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO THE BAR.

584
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,633
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO ANY BACHELOR PARTIES."

585
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,934
YOU KNOW, I KIND OF FEEL BAD
FOR ROGER.

586
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,470
- IT'S THE DISRESPECT.

587
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,137
- DISRESPECT TO WHO?
- I'M ALLOWING--

588
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:06,539
- TO ME.

589
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,341
- BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH YOU DOING IT.

590
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,577
- IT'S NOT GONNA BE FOR
ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF.

591
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:11,878
WE'RE NOT GETTING MARRIED
FOR AWHILE.

592
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,079
- I NEED TO WORK ON THIS
[bleep] FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.

593
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,581
- JENNI, YOU'LL BE
ENGAGED BY THEN.

594
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,550
- IF THIS KEEPS UP LIKE THIS,
SHE WON'T BE.

595
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,054
- I MEAN, SHE LOVES YOU.

596
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,590
- WHY ARE YOU
COOL WITH IT THEN?

597
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,659
- BECAUSE HE WOULD LEAVE ME
IF I WAS LIKE THAT.

598
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,795
- [laughing]

599
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:34,434
- SORRY, JENNI.

600
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,839
- YOU'RE PREGNANT?

601
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,208
I HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED TO
ANYONE THAT HAS BEEN PREGNANT.

602
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,943
DOES YOUR VAGINA RIP
TO YOUR BUTT HOLE?

603
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,745
- YEAH, I MEAN, IT CAN.
- UGH!

604
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,348
- YOU READY TO GO
GET YOUR BELLY LOOKED AT?

605
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,417
- TONIGHT I HAVE
MY DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT,

606
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:51,884
AND I'M JUST SO NERVOUS.

607
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,953
- IT'S MOVING?
- IT'S MOVING.

608
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:56,255
- THIS REAL.
- EW!
