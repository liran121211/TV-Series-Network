This sets off a combustible chain reaction, shocking Clint and the other bachelors - but it's JJ's response that seems to make the mansion explode. The remaining men will begin their travels to find love in New York City, where a rap battle group date with hip-hop legend DOUG E. FRESH, a bachelor Broadway competition featuring Disney's Aladdin, the Tony-winning hit Broadway musical, and a spectacular date at the Metropolitan Museum of Art all give Kaitlyn a new spring in her step. However, when former Bachelorette contestant Nick Viall (from Andi Dorfman's season) suddenly turns up in hopes of convincing Kaitlyn to include him in her search for love, her world is turned upside down."], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "4717094", "rating": 5.8, "votes": 20, "number_of_episodes": 238}
