1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,840
- [Narrator] Previously on
Wild Craft South Africa.

2
00:00:03,725 --> 00:00:08,135
(men whispering and rustling around)

3
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,559
- But he didn't drop.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,439
They took off at about
300 yards, he slowed down,

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,790
he stopped, turned around.

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,159
Ranged him again with the BDX.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,510
Got the dot on him, pulled the trigger.

8
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:34,786
(intense techno music)

9
00:00:34,787 --> 00:00:36,947
(gunfire)

10
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:40,495
(reloading the rifle)

11
00:00:40,497 --> 00:00:42,926
Well he took off again and
we didn't see him all day

12
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:46,067
and we, we spent about
five hours looking for him.

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,900
- Really?

14
00:00:46,903 --> 00:00:47,783
- Yeah.

15
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:50,807
And we covered a lot of area,
a lot of area just trying to

16
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:51,641
look for him.

17
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:54,754
But that's interesting thing,
you know, the previous days

18
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,489
I was excited about the animals I hunted

19
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:01,379
and I had excellent success
with them and this is,

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,699
this wasn't a success
but that's part of it.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,700
You compare the enthusiasm
of doing a job well and

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,719
getting an animal down quickly.

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,699
You know, so they don't suffer.

24
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,649
And I think that's a good
accomplishment this time.

25
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,889
I think I did a good
job, everything lined up

26
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,709
but the results weren't there.

27
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,954
I realize it's a part of hunting,
like Joe told me earlier.

28
00:01:25,955 --> 00:01:26,845
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,960
- If you don't miss, you're not hunting.

30
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:32,709
(intense instrumental music)

31
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:45,811
(upbeat beach music)

32
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,559
- Hunting was a conservation
tool that saved the wild

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,229
life of South Africa.

34
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,119
A nation nearly twice the size of Texas.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,209
With over 471,000 square miles.

36
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,849
The variety of animals
across this land mass is more

37
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,519
diverse than anywhere else in the world.

38
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,359
But of course, South Africa
is much more than just

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,599
beauty and nature.

40
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,379
It's filled with more
than 50 million people,

41
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,919
has some of the finest
cuisine in the world

42
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,369
and of course South Africa
enjoys the universal sport.

43
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,879
You guessed it, soccer.

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,159
Soccer first arrived in South
Africa through colonialism

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,929
in the late 19th century.

46
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,499
With leagues all across the
country, the passion for the

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,739
sport is stronger now than ever.

48
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,129
It's not just the animals that
draw us back to South Africa.

49
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:41,399
It's the friendships, the
culture and the mystery of this

50
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,869
great red dirt destination
that tugs on our souls and

51
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,150
brings us back time and time again.

52
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:50,425
(High-tempo drum music)

53
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,720
- The final sunrise pops up and

54
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,559
I tried to push the anxiety
out but it was there.

55
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,340
There's just no getting rid of it.

56
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:02,682
(intense Indian instrumental music)

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,549
It had been a phenomenal
hunt but I really wanted that

58
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,189
exclamation point I needed.

59
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,539
I think for my own sanity,
that exclamation point at the

60
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,370
end of the sentence.

61
00:03:15,373 --> 00:03:17,632
So, everybody else had found their kudu

62
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:19,149
that they were looking for.

63
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,869
They brought them back
to camp and we were still

64
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,950
looking for that one.

65
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:25,696
(rustling sounds)

66
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,939
I wanted to start feeling
sorry for myself already

67
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,469
with, you know, one full
day of hunting left to go.

68
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,160
Which is ridiculous but
that's where my mind was at.

69
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,909
(intense instrumental music)

70
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,739
- [Luke] Things were really
starting to take a toll.

71
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,419
Especially knowing that I've
got five, six, seven hours

72
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,509
left but those kudu move
on the fringe of daylight.

73
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,820
I mean don't get me wrong.

74
00:04:22,788 --> 00:04:25,568
I can't wait to go home
and hug the kids and tickle

75
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,119
the misses but going back with
a kudu sure would be nice.

76
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,869
I'm not gonna be disappointed
in the experience if I don't

77
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,260
but it'd be a nice little
cherry on top, you know.

78
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,400
It's gonna be a six hour wait probably.

79
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,489
But the hopes are those last
five minutes panning out

80
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,339
and that's a very, very
stressful place to be in.

81
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,480
I knew that even if we found a decent bull

82
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,559
Thys was still not
gonna let me have at it.

83
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,239
He wanted a good, mature
bull and he wasn't gonna stop

84
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,869
until either the sun
went down or we had one.

85
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,900
Nothing short of that.

86
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,595
(xylophone plays)

87
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,159
Aside from it's natural
beauty and plentiful hunting

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,519
opportunities, South Africa
is also a country that's

89
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,679
seen it's share of conflict.

90
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,569
It was a discovery of diamonds
and gold in 1867 that made

91
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,749
conflict between the Boers
and British inevitable.

92
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,689
And it resulted in a long,
bloody struggle that would

93
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,539
forever change the
landscape of South Africa.

94
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,989
While Fort Richmond is rich
in game animals and beauty,

95
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,419
it's also rich in history.

96
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,629
With artifacts left behind from
a time and people long past.

97
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,159
- So what's going on up here?

98
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,449
- Well I brought you up here
Alfredo, show you something

99
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,089
really cool and share
some of my family history.

100
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,429
- Oh, awesome.

101
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,859
- So this hill we're climbing
here actually has a fort

102
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,239
built under it by the British
army back in the Boer war

103
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,199
in the late 1800's, early 1900's.

104
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,339
And this is actually the
center of our property.

105
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,170
- Oh wow.

106
00:05:52,173 --> 00:05:54,552
- I mean, if we peek over
the top here my grandfathers

107
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:56,519
house is about 600 yards that way.

108
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,569
My house is about a mile that way.

109
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,119
And just over there is,
you know, our staff live

110
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,399
400 yards that way.

111
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,649
So this is the hub of our
entire farm and family

112
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,429
and our family actually settled here.

113
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,879
My history and family
history is actually from

114
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,820
British descent.

115
00:06:11,821 --> 00:06:14,329
Afrikaans were on my
mom's side and English on

116
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,119
my dad's side, who owns this property.

117
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,019
And what it was is there was
this buffer zone created,

118
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,329
from Carlsberg to
Kuruman of English farms.

119
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,439
So, what happened is a lot
of farmers from the 1820's

120
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,869
settled in Africa came and
settled here and other farmers

121
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,519
which is our family history
came from England and

122
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,879
were granted land.

123
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,209
They were allowed to
stake out land and farm it

124
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,869
and farm it for a certain x
amount of years and then buy

125
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,749
the land from the state and
keep it and our family actually

126
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,809
owned quite a few farms down here.

127
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,599
There's two families
left of our generation.

128
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,959
- Wow.

129
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,009
- And yeah, we have a very rich
family history in this area.

130
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,229
We've been here since 1854.

131
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,449
- Wow.

132
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,280
That's incredible.

133
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:04,039
- Title deeded in our family since 1867.

134
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,219
- Wow.

135
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,429
- So we've been here a long time.

136
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,538
- Wow that's incredible,
1860's, oh my gosh.

137
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:11,749
- So we've been here a while.

138
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,589
- Yeah, so tell me about the wall.

139
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,329
I see that there's a low
wall that's surrounding us.

140
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,709
What does this represent?

141
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,639
- When the British came here
and there was a big Boer War

142
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,799
in the late 1800's, early
1900's and they actually built

143
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,989
a reservist fort here.

144
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,459
The first battle of the
Boer War is in Belmont and

145
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,849
if you go almost straight
east for about 18 kilometers

146
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:40,059
as the crow flies, was the
first big battle of the Boer War

147
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,459
and the British army built
a reservist fort here.

148
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:47,279
And that's what we have left
here, these ruined walls.

149
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,089
They've cracked over the
years, they used to be a lot

150
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,049
higher, they've fallen
down and withered away

151
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,880
over the years.

152
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:54,292
- Right.
- But this used to be a fort.

153
00:07:54,293 --> 00:07:57,056
If you could look inside
there's different compartments.

154
00:07:57,057 --> 00:07:57,887
- Right.

155
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,579
- And there were cannon
placements and then if you have a

156
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,249
look on the hill over there
and the hill behind me

157
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,659
the two higher hills.

158
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,490
- Yes.

159
00:08:04,493 --> 00:08:06,642
- There were cannon
placements on either side.

160
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:10,059
What makes this hill the prime
spot for a fort is anywhere

161
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,599
on this hill you have a complete 360 view

162
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,279
of your immediate surroundings.

163
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,519
- I see that the wall continues
out that way and comes

164
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,329
around, it's not just this part here.

165
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,270
- Exactly.

166
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:25,829
It's circular structure with
different segments inside.

167
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,229
And then there's a defense
wall that runs right down the

168
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,140
bottom of it.

169
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:32,969
So, the barracks, tented
barracks were on the

170
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,079
bottom of the hill.

171
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,959
The British actually kicked
our family off the property.

172
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,800
My great great grandfather
actually stayed on the farm

173
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:43,812
because he was scared they
were gonna ruin his property.

174
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:46,420
He stayed in a little
workshop and we call that

175
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:48,776
the ref room, the refugee room.

176
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:49,897
(laughs)

177
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,299
They actually left and went
to go and stay with family in

178
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,859
Grahamstown while all that was going on.

179
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,749
But they built that wall
coming up so that you could,

180
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,129
under fire, come up into the
fort with you know, either

181
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,470
side if you needed to.

182
00:09:03,471 --> 00:09:07,307
And the officers actually
commandeered the old farmhouse

183
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,819
and stayed there.

184
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,650
- Wow.

185
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:10,949
So what's the connection?

186
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,780
So how did your family get into hunting?

187
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:12,693
- So, my great grandfather
was a big hunter.

188
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,240
- Okay.

189
00:09:19,243 --> 00:09:21,759
- And the family joke is always
that he could never shoot

190
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,009
anything when he went because
he used to take three things

191
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,479
with him at all times.

192
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,089
He used to take his old
.303 rifle with him,

193
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,579
he used to take his shotgun and a .22.

194
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,069
He used to take a .303 to
shoot springbok that were free

195
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,219
range, yeah in that time.

196
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,029
And he used to take his shotgun
to shoot birds and a .22

197
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,069
to shoot rabbits and a kudu
or a springbok would come by

198
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,169
and he'd aim at it and a bird
would fly up and he'd grab

199
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,919
the shotgun and a rabbit
would run by and he would

200
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,750
grab the .22.

201
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,601
(laughs) And he always used
to come home with nothing,

202
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:50,870
at least that's the family joke.

203
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:51,852
(laughs)

204
00:09:51,853 --> 00:09:52,959
- That's funny.

205
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,549
- My grandfathers not
that big of a hunter.

206
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,800
He's a cattleman and this
is a working cattle ranch.

207
00:09:57,804 --> 00:09:58,644
- Okay.

208
00:09:58,645 --> 00:10:01,177
- My dad was a big hunter and
he got that from his great

209
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,749
grandfather or his grandfather hunting,

210
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,149
together with him as a boy and
that's where he got his love

211
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,980
of hunting.

212
00:10:07,983 --> 00:10:08,821
- Oh that's neat.

213
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:10,326
- And that's where I
got my love of hunting.

214
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,509
I started hunting with my dad
when I was seven years old.

215
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:17,619
And then I was homeschooled
my whole high school career.

216
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,459
So from 14 til now all
I've done is hunted.

217
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,469
- Wow, that's awesome.

218
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,349
I have a lot of, I have
friends who, have that shared

219
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,949
hunting experience with their
father or grandfather and

220
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,869
that's a special type of
bond you develop I imagine?

221
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,479
- It is, I mean, you
know, Richard and Bat,

222
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,949
you know they've come and hunted here.

223
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:43,599
I've been able to share amazing
experience with them and

224
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,919
know what it means to
them because that's what I

225
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,149
experienced with my
father, hunting with him.

226
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,130
- Yeah, that's really neat.

227
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:51,209
- But now you know my family
history and I've showed you

228
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,729
this cool fort that, you
know, is built on our farm.

229
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,980
(techno western music)

230
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:10,076
- As the afternoon wore on,
Thys and I, you know we kept

231
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,149
trudging on and we were
trying some new dirt, some

232
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,939
stuff that we hadn't seen before.

233
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,209
We tried some places that
people had seen some decent

234
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,469
kudu bulls there before and
I knew that even if we found

235
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,499
a decent bull, Thys was still
not gonna let me have at it.

236
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,179
He wanted a good, mature
bull and he wasn't gonna stop

237
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,809
until either the sun
went down or we had one.

238
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,969
Nothing short of that.

239
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:33,359
So I had that in the back of
my mind and I was trying to

240
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,119
prepare myself to argue with
him a little bit if that came

241
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,299
but we were walking along,
us two tracking him, it

242
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,059
was mid-afternoon by this time
and I was looking off to my

243
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,019
left or right, I don't
remember but I bumped into Thys

244
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,949
And I probably about knocked
that poor little fellow over.

245
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,189
And I looked up at him when
I kinda regathered myself

246
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,390
and he was locked on
this spot ahead of him.

247
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,239
Like a pointer who's locked
on, you know a bird dog that's

248
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,610
locked on a bird somewhere.

249
00:11:56,611 --> 00:11:59,857
(intense techno music)

250
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:05,106
(rustling noises)

251
00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:09,789
(techno music intensifies)

252
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,220
And he was right there and
he looks up and he say's,

253
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:21,837
"cow".

254
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,760
Okay, cool.

255
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:50,616
And it turned it's head just
a little bit and I swear all

256
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,599
I could see were the tips
but apparently Thys saw more

257
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,730
and he said, "shoot it".

258
00:12:54,734 --> 00:12:57,984
(intense techno music)

259
00:13:01,873 --> 00:13:04,369
(gunshot)

260
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:06,609
I don't know how long I focused
on that but it felt almost

261
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,749
like a snapshot because at
that moment, all of the hours

262
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,159
of waiting and walking and
anticipating that visual of

263
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,299
having the kudu in the
crosshair's, it had finally come

264
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,159
to fruition, I was terrified
that it was gonna get out of

265
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,919
my graph just like that.

266
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,077
- Great one.

267
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:25,288
(breathes out heavily)

268
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,230
- Perfect.

269
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:29,489
When he turned I could just
see the exit wound here

270
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:30,750
behind the shoulder.

271
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:32,175
(laughs)

272
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,200
- The final afternoon, almost
40 miles on these boots.

273
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,769
- Well done.

274
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,770
- Just like that, 41 miles
and 40 some odd hours of

275
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,789
hunting kudu just (breathes out
quickly) compressed all into

276
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,700
one moment and I almost, almost lost it.

277
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:54,953
(breathes out shakily)

278
00:13:57,023 --> 00:13:59,119
- There's another one.

279
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,259
- Yes and he was hiding.

280
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,580
I just saw the beard.

281
00:14:01,581 --> 00:14:02,591
- And he was just gonna.

282
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:05,299
- And then I saw the two tips sticking up.

283
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,200
- I need a minute.

284
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,899
The adrenaline dump from
that moment was probably the

285
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,269
biggest adrenaline dump in a
hunting situation that I've

286
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,190
ever experienced.

287
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,670
- Well you earned him.

288
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,790
- Thank you.

289
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,960
- With pleasure, I didn't do much.

290
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,199
- He clearly thought he was
hidden there, didn't he?

291
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,030
- Yeah.

292
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,453
- Let us just continue
to move around like this.

293
00:14:45,454 --> 00:14:48,059
- Yeah you saw him just
like, looking up at us.

294
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,890
- And there was just
a little bit of brush.

295
00:14:48,893 --> 00:14:50,999
- He didn't think we could see him.

296
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,129
- There was a little bit of
brush but I thought, it's five

297
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,379
feet in front of him with a
300 win mag even if it does

298
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,479
deflect, it's not gonna deflect far.

299
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,979
And it clearly didn't.

300
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,280
- No the shot was perfect.

301
00:15:02,294 --> 00:15:05,450
(breathes out shakily)

302
00:15:05,451 --> 00:15:09,468
(breathes out heavily)

303
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:10,529
(patting sound)

304
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,330
- I'm all kinds of messed up.

305
00:15:12,332 --> 00:15:13,789
(laughs)

306
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,456
- It's understandable.

307
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:19,117
(upbeat instrumental music)

308
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,929
- That one's horns we
saw, lying back like that.

309
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,507
- And I wanted to shoot him,
I'm very thankful at the moment

310
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,060
that you didn't let me do that.

311
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,000
- Nice ivory tips.

312
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,079
- How old is this bull?

313
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,177
Would you guess, eight?

314
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:39,378
(men speaking over each other)

315
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,880
- Between eight and ten, yeah.

316
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,609
- I couldn't imagine what
I was doing eight years ago

317
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,460
when he was born.

318
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,390
Get off, get off.

319
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:53,400
So stunning.

320
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,309
But you're right, when I was
looking through the scope,

321
00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:00,140
I saw the mane, found his leg.

322
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,120
- Yeah.

323
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:04,313
- And that's just, cause I
could not see anything behind.

324
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:06,439
- But I'm glad we moved
out that little bit.

325
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,270
- We had to.

326
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:08,113
- Yeah.

327
00:16:08,114 --> 00:16:10,726
- I mean, like I said I could
see the leg about to where it

328
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,889
hit the body but I needed to
go up another eight inches

329
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,429
and I just couldn't see him there.

330
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:15,530
- Where the brush was.

331
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,999
- After I had settled down
a little bit and got the

332
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,550
adrenaline dump and the
dry heaving out of the way.

333
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,459
Thys knelt down by the nose
of that kudu and you know we

334
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,449
were looking at the mane and
admiring some of the markings

335
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,499
and looking at of course, the
curvature of the horns and

336
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
talking about that.

337
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,919
But he asked me, he goes, "you
see these three little dots?"

338
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,409
which ended up being kinda
down here on the cheeks and I

339
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,879
honestly hadn't really noticed.

340
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,899
They were there but they were kinda faint.

341
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,509
You obviously see the
big Chevron right across

342
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,969
the nose is stunning.

343
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,769
When you're looking in the
green bush it's like the first

344
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,549
thing you see, that Chevron
stripe stands out at you but

345
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,419
he said, "did you notice
these three little dots?

346
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,370
Sometimes even four".

347
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:56,309
I said, "well, I hadn't, you
know, what's that all about?".

348
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,609
- I don't know if you've heard
it before but here you can

349
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,859
see it a little bit.

350
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,730
- What are those called?

351
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:04,904
- (mumbles) it's a little
bit better but they call

352
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:06,859
it "The Fingerprints of God".

353
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,690
- Really?

354
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,879
- So what they said is when
God created them he put his

355
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,420
thumbs here and his, those
three fingers, and then he.

356
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,580
- That's the coolest
thing I've heard all week.

357
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,897
- Do you see it?

358
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,730
- Yeah I see.

359
00:17:21,733 --> 00:17:24,303
- It's like exactly where
your fingers would go.

360
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,059
- The legend says that when
God made the kudu, he put his

361
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,060
hands across the face.

362
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:34,829
And when he did that he put his
fingers on each one of those

363
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,729
little dots and he put his
thumbs together on the nose of

364
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,459
the Chevron and he said, "when
God finished making the kudu"

365
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,820
he went like this and he
said, "it is finished".

366
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,560
And when Thys told me that story,

367
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:51,357
all the emotions that I thought
I had just gotten rid of

368
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,660
came rushing right back.

369
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,280
It emulated what it meant
for me to come that far and

370
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,809
to be able to share that
moment with those men standing

371
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,890
around me right there

372
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,527
and that one animal.

373
00:18:05,528 --> 00:18:08,448
(soft piano music)

374
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,969
- [Director] Mark.

375
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,399
- Some dipshit amongst you
forgot to give us the keys

376
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,490
to the camps today.

377
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,019
- So you shot the padlock off?

378
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,850
- Close.

379
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:34,753
- No, no, no, no.

380
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:36,527
- Was that the first
shot I heard? (laughs)

381
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:38,625
- Luckily, we had a general purpose key.

382
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,706
(laughs)

383
00:18:41,734 --> 00:18:42,784
And we sorted ourselves out.

384
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:44,205
(laughs)

385
00:18:44,209 --> 00:18:45,109
(laughing drowns out speaking)

386
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,809
- Joe, you enjoyed it so much,

387
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,989
- as a little token.
- A keepsake. (laughs)

388
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,340
- I can open any padlock with
that, thank you very much.

389
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:53,210
- You can open anything with that.

390
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:54,635
- I don't know if they'll let
you on the plane with that.

391
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:56,006
(laughs)

392
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:57,183
- A universal key.

393
00:18:57,184 --> 00:18:59,139
(laughs)

394
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,349
- It opens most padlocks.

395
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,190
- Yeah.

396
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:03,959
Yeah, we could've taken
some videos and done a great

397
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,430
commercial for how secure
those padlocks are.

398
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:08,272
(clicking sound made with mouth)

399
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:09,857
- While y'all were out
breaking and entering.

400
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:10,748
(laughs)

401
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,659
Y'all missed some of the
best food we've ever had.

402
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,309
- Oh, no.

403
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,479
- Really.

404
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,989
- Well we were having, we
were having fun chasing

405
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,779
the warthogs, I mean, we
couldn't stop ourselves.

406
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,346
- Chasing them?

407
00:19:23,347 --> 00:19:24,617
- That's not the.

408
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:25,460
- That's not the point
of this whole exercise.

409
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:26,355
- The point.

410
00:19:26,356 --> 00:19:28,096
(laughs)

411
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,780
- Chasing them and scaring them.

412
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:31,859
(laughs)

413
00:19:33,766 --> 00:19:34,826
- Were they running like this?

414
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,859
(laughs)

415
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,930
- Geoffrey do you have any
participation medals made?

416
00:19:38,931 --> 00:19:40,537
(laughs)

417
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,189
- I couldn't convince myself
to pull ahead and squeeze,

418
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,459
I was shooting behind him.

419
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,839
- One of the funniest things
today was Douglas explaining

420
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,869
how the pigs run.

421
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,780
He says, "the pig runs and then it stops

422
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,620
and it looks at you

423
00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:56,833
but only for a second".

424
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,922
(laughs)

425
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,630
- And that's your time frame.
- And that was it right.

426
00:20:02,631 --> 00:20:04,659
(laughs)

427
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,439
- Well I had a good and
unusual day today for Africa.

428
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,270
- Oh yeah?

429
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,359
- Geoffrey and I went out this
morning to look for warthogs

430
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,810
but stumbled on a really nice blesbok.

431
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,990
And confirm that, my trust
in that BDX system elevated

432
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,219
just a little bit today.

433
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,379
- That's dead on.

434
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,210
- Dead on.

435
00:20:25,213 --> 00:20:26,942
- I couldn't believe it, yeah.

436
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:29,600
I mean we had, what, 15
mile an hour crosswind.

437
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:30,656
- Yep.

438
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,490
Yep.

439
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:32,331
- 388 yards.

440
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,156
- Yep.

441
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:33,989
- 388.

442
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:34,830
- 388.

443
00:20:34,831 --> 00:20:36,065
- Hit it, I'm like,
it's poke are you sure?

444
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,039
He's like, hit it, then
I'm like, range's good.

445
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:39,970
(smacking sound)

446
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:40,800
- Wow.

447
00:20:40,803 --> 00:20:41,641
- Done.

448
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:42,466
- Yeah.

449
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:43,299
- Cool.

450
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:44,142
- So we got camp meat.
- Awesome.

451
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,825
- We got some meat for the
camp but then after that,

452
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,780
nobody here can guess what I did today.

453
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,179
- No, that's wide open.

454
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,139
- See, I told you, nobody could guess.

455
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,249
I went to a soccer game.

456
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,080
- No way.

457
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,349
- Yep.

458
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,260
- Why?

459
00:20:57,261 --> 00:20:58,459
- Cause my son was playing in it.

460
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,869
- Oh, that's awesome.

461
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:00,720
- Well that's cool.

462
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:01,739
- Yeah.

463
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,729
So, the communities here,
obviously we're not in America,

464
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:08,369
where football and basketball are king.

465
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:10,409
Soccer is the universal sport and.

466
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:11,880
- Futbol.

467
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:13,111
- It's called soccer.

468
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:14,169
- Yeah.

469
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,409
It's called futbol here,
soccer in the states

470
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,849
but anyway.

471
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:22,149
So all the communities here
they get together and they

472
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,639
have soccer tournaments.

473
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,838
- Where? I haven't seen a lick
of grass since I got here.

474
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:26,668
- Well there is none.

475
00:21:26,671 --> 00:21:27,501
(laughs)

476
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:28,919
There is no grass.

477
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,750
(laughs)

478
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:30,591
- They're pitch.

479
00:21:30,592 --> 00:21:31,416
- They play, they play on the dirt.

480
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:32,249
- Play on the dirt.

481
00:21:32,252 --> 00:21:33,090
- That's all.

482
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,875
- Play on the dirt but
communities from all over come

483
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,589
together, I mean, Geoffrey
they been doing it.

484
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,169
- As long as I can remember.

485
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,470
I mean, I used to play
there when I was a kid.

486
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:46,579
Like, right where we are, you
know, few miles, probably 15

487
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,849
miles that way salt lake community
bout 20 miles that way is

488
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,449
Hayfield community and then
you know, they'll come as far

489
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,469
as Kimberley, you know.

490
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,339
This is 120 miles away.

491
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,005
- Yep. To play on a dirt field.

492
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:00,716
- Play on a dirt field.
- That's incredible.

493
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:01,691
- They're very competitive.

494
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:02,518
- Yep.

495
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,321
And there's no, there's no age limit.

496
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:05,172
- Yeah.

497
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:07,619
- If you're 14 and you're
good, you're on the team.

498
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,519
If you're 40 and you're
good, you're on the team.

499
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,969
- There's a referee? I mean
is it like, highly organized

500
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,950
- Yeah.

501
00:22:13,951 --> 00:22:15,080
- No it's.

502
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,251
- Amongst themselves there's a referee.

503
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,080
- And there's.

504
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:18,969
- Line referee's.

505
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,970
- Little bit of money involved.

506
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:22,409
You kinda gotta buy
your way into the game.

507
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,079
And then if you get beat
and you got enough money

508
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,139
you can buy your way into the next game.

509
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,999
I mean it's, but it's, no
it's serious and I mean it

510
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,129
draws a crowd and Fort
Richmond has a team.

511
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,080
- We have a team, yeah.

512
00:22:33,081 --> 00:22:35,319
- And Bat's played on it a
couple times when he's come over

513
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,519
so he wanted to play again this year, so.

514
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,350
- How'd they do?

515
00:22:38,353 --> 00:22:39,380
- That's great.

516
00:22:39,381 --> 00:22:40,211
(exhales loudly)

517
00:22:40,214 --> 00:22:41,409
- Sometimes you don't know.

518
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:42,629
It gets a little confusing at the end.

519
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,329
(laughs)

520
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,349
- We don't know whether the
won or lost cause there was

521
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,530
a hot dispute on the final score.

522
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:50,854
(laughs)

523
00:22:50,855 --> 00:22:53,355
- That's when you gotta grab
the money and run. (laughs)

524
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:54,934
(men speaking drowned
out by background noise)

525
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:58,629
- Our team said it was a draw,
the other team said we lost.

526
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,155
There was a heated argument.

527
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:01,236
- Well there's no scoreboard.

528
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,259
So, it's like soccer everywhere.

529
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,520
- When is somebody gonna
ask me about my damn day?

530
00:23:05,521 --> 00:23:07,009
(men speak over each
other in disagreement)

531
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,840
I've been sitting here.

532
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:09,092
- Pins and needles.

533
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:10,504
- Oh yeah.
- Okay, look.

534
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:12,055
- Tell us about (men
speaking over each other)

535
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:12,889
- The best for last.

536
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:13,912
- So there I was.

537
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:15,719
(laughs)

538
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,710
- Not yet.

539
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:18,915
(man speaks softly in background)

540
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,439
- No, it was a good day.

541
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,440
I tell ya, leaving this morning
going out of camp is just,

542
00:23:25,441 --> 00:23:28,539
my guts were just, anxiety, right?

543
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,549
I told myself, you know what
this is free-range hunt, if

544
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:34,689
I go home without a kudu,
I worked for it, it's fine.

545
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:35,720
I'm cool with that.

546
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,379
But I think it would've taken
me a couple days to really

547
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,159
accept that just because
dammit I worked for it.

548
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,917
I deserve a kudu, right?

549
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:45,748
(laughs)

550
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:48,491
So we went back to where
we were yesterday that.

551
00:23:48,492 --> 00:23:50,110
Thank you Mark.

552
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:53,641
That big bull that we saw and
was hoping that he had come

553
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,559
back after we bumped him off
yesterday and climbed up the

554
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,879
top kudu mountain and I'll
be damned, he wasn't there.

555
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,710
- Again.

556
00:24:00,713 --> 00:24:01,551
- Again.

557
00:24:01,552 --> 00:24:02,936
He was back with his lady friends and.

558
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,999
- Unafraid.

559
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,940
- Unafraid.

560
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:07,289
And they go off aways and
we worked up, would you say

561
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,314
40 yards about?

562
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:09,515
- Yeah, more or less.
- I mean, that first time

563
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,429
we were right on him and Thys
Could see him behind the bush

564
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:16,185
and I'm like, okay.

565
00:24:16,186 --> 00:24:17,166
- If you say he's there.

566
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:19,160
- If you say he's there, I believe you.

567
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:20,477
And we ease around the bush.

568
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,630
- Ease around the bush.

569
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,319
- There was nothing there
but tracks, how can,

570
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,719
what do they weigh 500 pounds?

571
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,849
- Yeah.
- A mature bull.

572
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,879
- How can a 500 pound animal
at 40 yards leave without us

573
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,369
hearing or seeing a thing.

574
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,699
- Cause you're not a very good hunter.

575
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,530
- No that's not true.

576
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:35,373
(laughs)

577
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:36,936
- That is a blatant lie.

578
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,770
- No I mean.

579
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:39,612
- They don't call them the
great ghost for nothing.

580
00:24:39,613 --> 00:24:40,451
- Exactly.

581
00:24:40,452 --> 00:24:41,596
- That's what makes it awesome.

582
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,109
So he, anyway, to shorten
up this part of the day.

583
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,949
He took off and we just
couldn't catch up with him.

584
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,659
He was gone and Thys said,
"you know what this one just

585
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,820
isn't gonna happen" and
we were on his track

586
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,379
for a long time.

587
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,789
We devoted a couple hours this
morning were on him for that

588
00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:01,209
long and after we we ran that,
the bull that, my bull, out

589
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,669
of the country we came back
for lunch and I was licking

590
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,829
my wounds and again, as that
sun continued to kinda inch

591
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,759
toward the horizon, I mean,
I told myself I would be good

592
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,959
if I didn't shoot a bull, but.

593
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,329
I thought I meant it, I don't
I meant it cause my guts were

594
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,579
just knotted up terribly.

595
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,129
Wanna go home, see the wife and the kids.

596
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:18,960
- Yeah.

597
00:25:18,963 --> 00:25:21,061
- It wasn't ready, my mission
was not complete, I didn't

598
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:22,027
(mumbles) so.

599
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,219
- You wasn't ready sun
to set on Africa was you?

600
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,050
- No, not at all.

601
00:25:25,053 --> 00:25:26,718
That's a great way to say it.
- Yeah.

602
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:27,549
- Not at all.

603
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,332
I just, I wasn't, the experience
wasn't complete for me

604
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:34,869
quite yet and so, we rounded
this one bend, we were working

605
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,329
our way down this two track
and Thys grabbed my arm.

606
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:41,137
"Right there, cow, cow, cow"
and she couldn't a been,

607
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,029
by that point, I mean we
slipped right up on her.

608
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:45,679
She must've been a hundred
yards, ballpark, if that.

609
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,510
- Between 80 and a hundred, yeah.

610
00:25:46,513 --> 00:25:47,353
- Yeah, yeah.

611
00:25:47,354 --> 00:25:50,026
So she was close and we're
looking at her and looking at her

612
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:54,056
and all the sudden, from behind
her in the bush, he goes,

613
00:25:54,057 --> 00:25:55,987
"I see a mane".

614
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,949
And then once he pointed it
out just to the left of this

615
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,709
bush I saw the mane sticking down

616
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,619
and I could see the front leg.

617
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,859
I'm like oh.

618
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,529
And I, you know, and from that
point I kinda looked to see

619
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,429
if I could see it through the,
I had the bino's up at that

620
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,649
point to see if I could see any, you know,

621
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,779
how big the horns were.

622
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,610
- Yeah, yeah.

623
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,853
- Listen to me, I can't even
spit it out, I'm so excited

624
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:16,437
(laugh drowns out speaking)

625
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,099
He goes, "I see his
tips, that's a good bull,

626
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:18,930
that's a good bull".

627
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:20,603
He's like, "you think you
can take the shot?", I said

628
00:26:20,604 --> 00:26:23,399
no because I couldn't see
his head, which, so what?

629
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,230
- Yeah.

630
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:27,149
- If he says it's a good
critter, I'm down with that.

631
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,090
I trust him.

632
00:26:28,091 --> 00:26:31,660
But I just, there was a bush
right in the sweet spot.

633
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:33,478
- I'm like.
- Yeah.

634
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,539
- I'm not comfortable with that.

635
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:36,579
I'm just not comfortable
so just like this morning,

636
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,109
you know, you talked about
training all the time.

637
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,899
We started pieing off,
just had the rifle ready.

638
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,779
He had the sticks ready
and we just kept pieing off

639
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,689
around the corner to get
a little better angle

640
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,520
and that bull stood.

641
00:26:45,523 --> 00:26:47,243
I mean, he thought he
was invisible, right.

642
00:26:47,244 --> 00:26:49,039
He just stood there and he was locked.

643
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,979
And I could see more of the
mane and more of the mane.

644
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,078
Then I got to see about 90%
of his chest and he goes,

645
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,837
"can you see him?". I
said, "yeah I can see him".

646
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,840
I can't see his horns so if
you say he's a good bull,

647
00:26:57,842 --> 00:26:59,842
put the sticks down, got on
him, he goes, "can you see him?"

648
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:03,640
and right where I wanted to
shoot, pick that hair moment.

649
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:04,549
- You know.
- Yeah, yeah.

650
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,549
- There was a little clump
of brush and I thought,

651
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,850
did some, you know, redneck math.

652
00:27:07,852 --> 00:27:08,690
(laughs)

653
00:27:08,691 --> 00:27:10,745
- 300 win mag, the brush
couldn't have been more than a

654
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,592
couple feet in front of.

655
00:27:11,593 --> 00:27:12,795
- Yeah, there was probably
three or four feet.

656
00:27:12,796 --> 00:27:13,625
- If it deflects, so what?

657
00:27:13,628 --> 00:27:16,598
It's not gonna deflect
enough and goes, take him.

658
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:17,444
(pow sound made with mouth)

659
00:27:17,445 --> 00:27:20,517
And I cut it loose, cycled
another round in, and he's

660
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,509
running and Thys grabs
my arm again and goes,

661
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,917
"it's over" cause as he turned
you could see the exit wound

662
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,229
right behind and he didn't go, 40 yards.

663
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,500
I was a rock up until that point.

664
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:30,847
Do you remember how it went down?

665
00:27:30,853 --> 00:27:31,693
- Yeah.

666
00:27:31,694 --> 00:27:33,765
- I was, slung the rifle
up and I kinda went.

667
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:35,466
(laughs)

668
00:27:35,474 --> 00:27:37,562
(laughter drowns out men speaking)

669
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:39,179
- He was like, "I need a moment".

670
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,010
- I need a moment.

671
00:27:40,013 --> 00:27:40,961
- The adrenaline dump.

672
00:27:40,962 --> 00:27:42,882
- Just sat there, we could see
him, he was in the rocks, he

673
00:27:42,883 --> 00:27:45,659
was done and just, it
was, that's exactly it.

674
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,999
Those two words, adrenaline dump and just.

675
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,830
- Your hands were shaking.

676
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,163
- My lips started quivering,
my hands started shaking.

677
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:53,068
(breathes out heavily)

678
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:56,456
(men speaking over each other)

679
00:27:56,457 --> 00:27:59,387
- It was like a combination
of, what did you say today?

680
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:01,839
40 miles more or less, this week?

681
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,039
- I had my phone in my
pocket and you know,

682
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,119
google's watching me all the time.

683
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,349
When we left camp at noon, we
had logged, and I didn't have

684
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:11,919
my phone in my pocket the whole
time but it was at 38 miles

685
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,080
for the week, on foot.

686
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,629
So, I think all that just.

687
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,460
- Well deserved.

688
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:17,303
Well deserved.

689
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:18,706
- Yep, nicely done.

690
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:21,960
- For four years I've come
over here and hunted kudu and

691
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:25,909
killed the kudu on the
last day, last light.

692
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,859
- Yeah.
- Four years in a row.

693
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,239
It's becomes so regular that last year

694
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,730
we kudu hunted one day.

695
00:28:31,733 --> 00:28:32,571
(laughs)

696
00:28:32,572 --> 00:28:33,396
the last day.

697
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:36,169
- We hunted other things,
we hunted buffalo, we hunted

698
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,339
all sorts and we're like,
let's go kudu hunting

699
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,339
and Richard was like, no.

700
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,749
I'm like why?

701
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,237
He's like, you know what happens.

702
00:28:43,238 --> 00:28:44,068
(laughs)

703
00:28:44,071 --> 00:28:47,799
like, let's leave it,
let's see how far we can

704
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,630
push this one.

705
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:50,303
(laughs) And leave it to the last day.

706
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,726
(laughs)

707
00:28:51,727 --> 00:28:54,837
- And it did, last day,
last light, I took a kudu.

708
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,800
- And.

709
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:57,200
- So this year,

710
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,769
to come,

711
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,649
I was a little afraid that I would

712
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,869
be so busy kudu hunting I
wouldn't have the opportunity

713
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:07,349
to appreciate the excitement
that the friends I brought were

714
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,000
gonna experience and that
bothered me a little bit.

715
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:16,120
Somehow, first day, we walk
up on here on the hill and.

716
00:29:16,246 --> 00:29:19,576
(intense western music)

717
00:29:49,765 --> 00:29:50,925
- Pa is looking at something.

718
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,860
He's lying on that rock
flatter than a snake.

719
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:57,187
- On that middle hill?

720
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,789
- Yes.

721
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,230
He's lying flat on the top of a big rock.

722
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:04,190
He's staring down in that bush as if

723
00:30:04,191 --> 00:30:06,191
there's something there.

724
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,840
(rustling)

725
00:30:27,224 --> 00:30:28,064
- Yep.

726
00:30:32,517 --> 00:30:33,377
- Yep, there he barked.

727
00:30:33,381 --> 00:30:34,551
- I heard him.

728
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,920
- It's amazing how we
know he's in that thicket.

729
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,960
And you would never
know it if you sat here.

730
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:56,941
(intense techno music plays)

731
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:11,329
- I got him at 250 yards, let's just wait.

732
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,056
(rustles)

733
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,690
- 261, just wait for
him to turn broadside.

734
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:25,167
He's coming, he's coming.

735
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,239
(gunshot)

736
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:55,911
(reload noises)

737
00:32:03,876 --> 00:32:06,126
(whistles)

738
00:32:14,591 --> 00:32:15,886
(gunshot)

739
00:32:15,887 --> 00:32:17,547
- You hit him again.

740
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,430
- Good shot, a bit far back
but he's bleeding good.

741
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,050
He's gonna go down in that thicket.

742
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,730
He's pumping blood right.

743
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,219
You hit him a bit far back

744
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,569
you caught back lung he's bleeding good.

745
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,520
- Yeah I pulled it.

746
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,200
(laughs)

747
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:38,435
- Hey, you know this
was the first day right?

748
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:39,266
(laughs)

749
00:32:39,269 --> 00:32:42,209
- I know, let's break the
last day, last sunset.

750
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,299
Let's make it the first
sunset on the first day.

751
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,355
Let's start a new tradition.

752
00:32:46,356 --> 00:32:47,186
(upbeat keyboard music)

753
00:32:47,189 --> 00:32:48,019
Well done.

754
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,589
He just, he came out of nowhere.

755
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,680
I mean, we watched him forever.

756
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:01,507
I couldn't see he was a
bull for the longest time.

757
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,659
And then we sent Pa around,

758
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,839
he did that whole turn
and I could see it's

759
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,940
the one we were after.

760
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,630
And he stood in the thicket.

761
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,630
- For an hour.

762
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:13,471
- For another hour.

763
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,296
- Yep.

764
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,830
- Where we couldn't even see him then.

765
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,109
And then I don't know what
spooked him but something

766
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,089
and he just came straight towards us.

767
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:24,609
He broke from 380 yards
and your first shot

768
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,060
I think it was 160 something.

769
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:29,791
I can't even remember now.

770
00:33:30,785 --> 00:33:32,755
- I can't believe we shot
a kudu on the first day.

771
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:35,568
(laughs)

772
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,400
- Well done my friend.

773
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,740
Let's grab our gear and walk down there.

774
00:33:41,743 --> 00:33:42,583
- All right.

775
00:33:42,584 --> 00:33:45,156
(upbeat music)

776
00:33:50,511 --> 00:33:53,059
- Look how light he is.
- Yeah, he's very white.

777
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,739
Doesn't have the deepest
curls but he's all right.

778
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,280
He's got the good shape.

779
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,360
Thank you pa.

780
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,560
- Thank you pa.

781
00:34:00,564 --> 00:34:03,154
(upbeat music)

782
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,659
- Geoffrey, this is what I like
so much about kudu hunting.

783
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,579
We're trying to get back to camp.

784
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,140
The hunters are probably
sitting there waiting on us.

785
00:34:15,144 --> 00:34:16,226
(laughs)

786
00:34:16,227 --> 00:34:19,077
And Pa sees this big bull out of nowhere.

787
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,629
- Well, it ties back into
now, now and just now.

788
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,920
We've said now but it's way past just now.

789
00:34:23,922 --> 00:34:25,094
(laughs)

790
00:34:25,095 --> 00:34:26,595
- I ain't even gonna go there.

791
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,369
We were perfect.

792
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,899
That's why you're the
professional I guess.

793
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,289
That's why I listen to you.

794
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:35,349
- Well, this time it just shows
you how important trackers

795
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,169
are as part of the team.

796
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,949
I mean you and I, we're just
walking along talking about

797
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,289
nonsense, talking about what
are we gonna eat tonight.

798
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,859
And he decided to climb a
few hills and look for kudu

799
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,399
and ended up seeing this
bull, hauled ass down the hill

800
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,230
and called us.

801
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:53,218
- So now you gotta give
him a raise, right?

802
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,050
Look at the nice ivory on the tips.

803
00:34:54,053 --> 00:34:55,883
- I need to give him more than a raise.

804
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:57,418
(laughs)

805
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,469
But yes, it just shows you
how vital a part of the team

806
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,440
they are as well.

807
00:35:01,441 --> 00:35:03,569
- Well let's get this thing
taken care of and a beautiful

808
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,370
part of this is we got
kudu backstrap's now.

809
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,150
- Tomorrow night.

810
00:35:08,153 --> 00:35:09,911
- Tomorrow night.
- On the grill, it's a deal.

811
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:10,790
- All right, man.

812
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,700
- Let's do it.

813
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:14,292
(upbeat music)

814
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:28,980
- I like to ask everybody,
what was the most,

815
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,919
I guess you could say cool or memorable

816
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,440
experience of this week?

817
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,089
When somebody says, "hey you
just went to Africa and hunted

818
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,819
free-range kudu for a week".

819
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,380
What is that first hand reach.

820
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,340
What'll be the thing ties you here?

821
00:35:46,343 --> 00:35:47,633
- What sticks out the most?

822
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:48,474
- Yeah.

823
00:35:48,475 --> 00:35:51,376
- Wow, I mean cause that's
kind of a slideshow, you know.

824
00:35:51,377 --> 00:35:52,207
- Yeah.

825
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:54,029
- It just starts a slideshow.

826
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:57,879
You know, first off thanks
for inviting me and sharing

827
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,139
your experience here and
what you've found here.

828
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,230
This is definitely a special
place and special people.

829
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:06,522
- And the camp ain't too bad either is it?

830
00:36:06,523 --> 00:36:10,049
- Well I mean, I think the
camp really means a lot

831
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:10,990
to me because

832
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,200
I'm a big literature buff.

833
00:36:15,203 --> 00:36:17,153
You know, I read a lot of outdoor writing.

834
00:36:17,154 --> 00:36:20,939
Especially the old school
and if you know, if you read

835
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,659
Hemingway and Ruark, you know,
the American authors or even

836
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,180
the old time people over here.

837
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,459
- Yeah, you know I mean, they
talk about hunting out of

838
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,639
tent camps and of course it's
much more complicated for them

839
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,119
back in those days but as far
as I know, this is probably

840
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:43,629
the closest you can get to
reliving that kind of experience.

841
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,259
To be able to, you know
you're living in tents.

842
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,160
You have the comforts,
they had the comforts.

843
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:49,000
- Yeah.

844
00:36:49,001 --> 00:36:49,985
- They brought a lot of stuff along.

845
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,859
If you read their books but
you know them just walking out

846
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,429
of camp and hunting
what you see out there.

847
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,260
- Exactly.

848
00:36:57,263 --> 00:36:58,101
- What you find.

849
00:36:58,102 --> 00:36:59,886
I mean that's, I think
that's a special experience.

850
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:04,809
- But still what's that, the
coolest thing for me was?

851
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:08,639
- Watching a herd of 12
zebras for 45 minutes.

852
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,470
- Yeah.

853
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:12,952
- Being, just being zebras,
you know, family with a,

854
00:37:12,953 --> 00:37:16,659
momma with a little baby there
and just the interaction with

855
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,429
them and just watching the
whole thing and laying down

856
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,677
and getting up and going in
the dusk and the red dust.

857
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,579
- Watch them in their natural environment,

858
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,639
acting the way they would.

859
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,470
- Yeah, just yeah.

860
00:37:26,473 --> 00:37:29,102
- You always feel like
part of the herd in that.

861
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:31,149
- Yeah you just, you feel.
- In that moment.

862
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,539
- Exactly. And people ask us
all the time, why do you hunt?

863
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,299
And for 45 minutes you
lived with the zebras.

864
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,130
- Yeah.

865
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:38,959
It was brief but it's special here right.

866
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,218
- You were part of Africa,
you wasn't looking at Africa,

867
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:42,048
you were part of it.

868
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,379
- Very, very cool experience.

869
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,210
- Yeah.

870
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,540
- Alfredo, what about you?

871
00:37:47,727 --> 00:37:48,777
- There's two things that are.

872
00:37:48,778 --> 00:37:51,136
- This is what I did this summer, what.

873
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,319
- Yeah, so there's two interesting things.

874
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,950
There's like a 400 foot
level and there's the,

875
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,009
an experience I had that was just.

876
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,769
- Does it ever bother you
that you might be a little

877
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:02,939
overly analytical?

878
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,979
(laughs)

879
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,810
- Nope.

880
00:38:04,813 --> 00:38:06,949
- Okay, I'm just asking, just asking.

881
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,160
- That's why I have very few friends.

882
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,239
(laughs)

883
00:38:11,242 --> 00:38:13,041
(men speaking over each other)

884
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:14,472
- I think you might have
made a friend this week.

885
00:38:14,473 --> 00:38:15,935
(men speaking over each other)

886
00:38:15,936 --> 00:38:17,586
(laughs)

887
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,420
- That's right.

888
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,790
So, like the 400 foot views

889
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,449
exactly about living with the animals,

890
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,560
living in Africa, being part of it.

891
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:33,059
It is so bizarre, I'm new to hunting.

892
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,080
I'm not veteran hunters like both Luke

893
00:38:37,135 --> 00:38:39,965
and Joe or anyone here.

894
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,480
And so, all this fascinates me but

895
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,880
we were sitting,

896
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,299
chasing the blesbok the
other day and we're sitting

897
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,529
in the field and watching
the blesbok and the zebra,

898
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,530
together and then the
zebras went around this way

899
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,159
and we're watching them here.

900
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,890
And it's, we were there.

901
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,069
And everywhere you go, just
like Joe was saying, everywhere

902
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:12,830
you go, okay here's some
Steinbok, here's some.

903
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:14,815
- Duiker.

904
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,650
- Duiker.

905
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,193
Here's this warthog, here's this.

906
00:39:19,105 --> 00:39:23,865
And so, and all of them
are game, fair game.

907
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:24,700
- Yeah.

908
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,909
- That's really neat.

909
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,469
- The big picture for me was
the ability to share something

910
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,549
I'm so passionate about and people that

911
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,510
I'm passionate about.

912
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:39,270
You know, Geoffrey and Thys
and Mark and the staff here,

913
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:41,447
they're special people to me.

914
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:42,649
Being able to share that.

915
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,480
- Leon's not?

916
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:44,321
- Leon.

917
00:39:44,322 --> 00:39:45,146
- Oh yeah, that guy!

918
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,099
(laughs)

919
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,199
- Good friend of yours.

920
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:51,442
- No I knew I was forgetting somebody.

921
00:39:51,443 --> 00:39:52,667
(laughs)

922
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:53,498
- Sitting right here.

923
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:54,559
- It's always him.

924
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,540
- He came late.

925
00:39:55,542 --> 00:39:56,595
(laughs)

926
00:39:56,596 --> 00:39:57,875
- That's what happens when
you get to the fire late.

927
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:59,516
(laughs)

928
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:04,520
- But no, to be able to share
that with other friends like

929
00:40:04,718 --> 00:40:08,518
Luke and Joe and Alfredo.

930
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,699
That to me is something special,
just set around this fire

931
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,529
every night and hear your
reactions to Africa and something

932
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:20,530
that's dear to me, find other
people that appreciate it,

933
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,509
maybe not as much but almost as much.

934
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,609
- It's life changing for me.

935
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:24,940
- Yeah.

936
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:29,249
- And it's definitely a
big peak and you know,

937
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:34,250
I'm not 25 or 35 and I've done
a lot of cool things and this

938
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,099
is a nice big peak and it
makes me look forward to even

939
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,159
more adventures and so
I want to say thank you.

940
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,150
I'm not ready to go home.

941
00:40:43,153 --> 00:40:44,962
I don't wanna go home but I'm going home.

942
00:40:44,963 --> 00:40:47,139
- I never thought in my
mid-30's I'd be homesick but

943
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,209
I got three little one's at home that I.

944
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,529
Sometimes, even though this
experience has been, I hate

945
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,119
the word too, but it's epic.

946
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:53,950
- Yep.

947
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,331
- Sometimes a man just
want's to go home and play

948
00:40:55,332 --> 00:40:56,160
Barbie's on the floor.

949
00:40:56,163 --> 00:40:57,003
(laughs)

950
00:40:57,004 --> 00:40:58,356
And that's what I'm gonna do.

951
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,119
- You may take your animals
you killed and you may have

952
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:05,669
them mounted or you may
get a European mount.

953
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,829
Six to eight months later they'll
show up but I think one of

954
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:11,149
the most special memories your gonna find.

955
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,310
Cause you'll be home for a
week, week and a half and you're

956
00:41:13,311 --> 00:41:16,597
gonna need to get your boots
out or something that you had

957
00:41:16,598 --> 00:41:19,018
over here and you're gonna
pull it out and this,

958
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,839
this here is gonna fall out of it.

959
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,670
- Yeah.

960
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,420
- And you'll be right back here.

961
00:41:27,308 --> 00:41:31,058
(intense instrumental music)

962
00:42:00,657 --> 00:42:03,657
(light piano music)

963
00:42:10,044 --> 00:42:13,634
(men singing native music)

964
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:24,409
- When you come to Africa and
you bring a knife with you

965
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:27,539
for whatever reason you made
need it, bring a Spyderco.

966
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:29,690
Remember a Spyderco belongs in Africa.

967
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:34,316
(men singing native music)

968
00:43:43,491 --> 00:43:46,991
(knife sharpening sounds)

969
00:43:55,668 --> 00:43:57,058
- Who makes them?

970
00:43:57,064 --> 00:43:58,564
- Hunters HD Gold.

971
00:44:01,992 --> 00:44:04,351
They'll put your prescription right in.

972
00:44:04,352 --> 00:44:06,750
- You said they help you pick up animals

973
00:44:06,753 --> 00:44:08,703
or everything just looks better.

974
00:44:10,419 --> 00:44:12,546
- They're happy glasses.

975
00:44:12,547 --> 00:44:13,597
- They're happy glasses?

976
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,430
- Yeah.

977
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:15,303
- They make you happy?

978
00:44:15,304 --> 00:44:16,694
- Yeah, put them on.

979
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:20,525
(rustling drowns out talking)

980
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,230
- Oh yes.

981
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:27,479
- See, are you happy now?

982
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,779
- You can't not be happy.

983
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,139
- All right give me the glasses back.

984
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,759
- Your eyes are almost as bad as mine.

985
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,409
I can see you perfectly.

986
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:36,939
I can see that scope perfectly.

987
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,150
- Those don't even have
a prescription in them.

988
00:44:39,152 --> 00:44:39,992
- Really?

989
00:44:39,993 --> 00:44:41,705
- No, them are just regular glasses.

990
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:44,490
- Well I can't see the scope
perfectly without them.

991
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,100
- See, they're happy glasses.

992
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:53,869
- I wouldn't travel 8,000
miles, halfway around the world

993
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:55,839
with a rifle that I didn't trust.

994
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,329
I pick up a Mossberg I
expect this gun to be MOA

995
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:00,809
and it's never let me down yet.

996
00:45:00,810 --> 00:45:03,949
Any Mossberg I pick up, this
particular barrel action has

997
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:06,869
been with me in the mountains of Idaho.

998
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,219
It's been in with me to New
Zealand and it's been with me

999
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:11,299
here now in South Africa.

1000
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,139
This exact same setup.

1001
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,159
I am not a graceful guy
going through the bush of

1002
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,139
South Africa with thorns
and all kinds of other crap.

1003
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,279
I need a rifle that's capable
of standing up to the beatings

1004
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,259
that I am gonna inadvertently give to it.

1005
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,710
Not only the barrel action
but the scope as well.

1006
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,209
I like this look, for a
long time Mossberg has

1007
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:29,799
had their marinecote.

1008
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,609
Now I know they're changing
a lot of that over to the

1009
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:34,049
cerakote finish which of course
is extremely popular right

1010
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:35,800
now in rifles and handguns as well.

1011
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,179
For this application, again
because everything except for

1012
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,549
the animals seem to
have thorns in country.

1013
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,489
Just a very simple polymer stock.

1014
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,969
It can take the scratches,
it can take the abuse, when

1015
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,989
I get home, I'm probably gonna
pull the scope, I'm gonna

1016
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,089
pull the stock and I'm gonna
put the original, very sexy

1017
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,359
laminate stock back on this.

1018
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,069
It's a sweet looking rifle,
it shoot's really really well.

1019
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:58,689
And again with this BDX
system, we're pounding steel up

1020
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,779
to 400 yards with a 300 win mag.

1021
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,859
I would feel very confident
with this gun, laying on that

1022
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,409
rock right there and shooting
a kudu with a great rest out

1023
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:09,259
to 400 yards with no
reservations whatsoever.

1024
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,809
So, my suggestion to you if
you've got a safari coming up.

1025
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:13,640
If you want to go to New Zealand.

1026
00:46:13,643 --> 00:46:16,732
If you wanna go any, if you
wanna go out west, spend your

1027
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:19,339
money on the hunt and then spend
your money on the taxidermy

1028
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:22,059
afterward, get yourself a rifle
that you know that's gonna

1029
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,530
work and spend the money
on all the fun stuff.
