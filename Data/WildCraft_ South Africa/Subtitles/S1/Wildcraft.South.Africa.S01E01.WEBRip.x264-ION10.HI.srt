1
00:00:00,581 --> 00:00:03,581
- (uplifting music)

2
00:00:27,143 --> 00:00:28,380
(rifle clicks)

3
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:31,557
(footsteps rustle)

4
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:34,388
(uplifting music)

5
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,369
(dramatic music)

6
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:02,022
(music drowns out excited chatter)

7
00:01:02,023 --> 00:01:04,768
(dramatic music)

8
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,770
- [Geoffrey] Yup, yup!

9
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:15,319
(rifle fires and clicks)

10
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:17,473
(heavy breathing)

11
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:20,224
(dramatic music)

12
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,530
(upbeat music)

13
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,409
- [Richard] As a long-time outdoor writer,

14
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,689
I've had the opportunity to hunt some

15
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,839
of the world's most pristine,
exotic in game-rich country.

16
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,929
I've also been fortunate
to have been part of

17
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,609
more than a dozen African safaris.

18
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,739
Africa, it's the place
where I best connect

19
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,319
with my passion for wildlife,

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,726
and answer the call of a hunter.

21
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,087
(upbeat music)

22
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,039
My name is Richard Mann.

23
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,599
For guys like me, for hunters,

24
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,259
Africa's the place that unlocks

25
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,279
that deeply-embedded genetic coding.

26
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,279
On this safari for free range kudu

27
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,139
in Africa's northern cape,

28
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,229
I get to share this stunning country

29
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,229
and everything it has to offer,

30
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,649
with some colleagues and
friends from the United States.

31
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,259
With the help of Geoffrey Wayland,

32
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,279
my long-time hunting
guide, turned good friend,

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,729
and his trusted team of professionals.

34
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,470
I'm excited to see what lies ahead for us.

35
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:43,351
(upbeat music)

36
00:02:45,836 --> 00:02:49,416
(lively rock guitar music)

37
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,678
- [Geoffrey] Do you see
anything yet, Richard?

38
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:06,265
- [Richard] No, I was looking, you know,

39
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,049
where we jumped that bull this morning.

40
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,339
- Yes, between that little valley there.

41
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,489
- Yeah, I was looking there,

42
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,809
I figured he may, may
have got in the hills

43
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,560
like you say they do sometimes, so.

44
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:18,886
But I haven't seen a thing.

45
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:19,791
[Geoffrey] Do you think two years ago,

46
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:20,650
sitting on this very hill,

47
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:22,550
we'd be doing what we doing now?

48
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,599
- [Richard] Above, like
this epic camp, you mean?

49
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,219
- [Geoffrey] I built it, I hope it's good.

50
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,960
Clients are gonna arrive today.

51
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,990
- [Richard] Well,
they're not just clients,

52
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:32,821
they're my friends.

53
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,554
I mean, you know this is
my favorite place to hunt.

54
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:36,699
Kudu is my favorite thing
to hunt, you know that.

55
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,530
- [Geoffrey] I know,
that's why you come back.

56
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:38,373
- [Richard] And that's why, yeah,

57
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:39,686
and that's why I invited 'em.

58
00:03:39,693 --> 00:03:43,639
- [Geoffrey] I mean, I
met Alfredo at SHOT Show.

59
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,179
Don't know much about him, but--

60
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,409
- [Richard] We know he's probably

61
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,429
one of the best gun
photographers in the industry.

62
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,919
- [Geoffrey] He showed me
some stills of SHOT Show

63
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
that were unbelievable.

64
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:53,039
- [Richard] Yeah, he's an incredible,

65
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,809
but he hasn't hunted
much, he's new to hunting.

66
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,399
He's really into it, he's a perfectionist.

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,799
Like everything with his hunting,

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,629
he does with his photography,
he's a perfectionist.

69
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,979
- [Alfredo] Hi, my name is Alfredo Rico,

70
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,529
and I'm a free-lance
photographer and writer

71
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,479
for Guns and Ammo, and
it's sister publications.

72
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,339
I enjoy hunting whether
it's with an air rifle, 22,

73
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,819
6.5 Creedmoor, I don't care.

74
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,969
Hand me something, and tell
me go hunt it, I'll hunt it.

75
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,469
- I met Joe at SHOT Show as well.

76
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,729
He seems like, you know.

77
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,330
- [Richard] Oh, Joe's an old hand.

78
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,936
He worked at Cabela's for years,

79
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,539
in the media relations department.

80
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,889
He's hunted with all, about
all the outdoor writers.

81
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,099
- [Geoffrey] Oh that will be cool,

82
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,299
to hear some good stories
running around the campfire.

83
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,049
- [Richard] Yeah, I know,
he's been to Africa before,

84
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,579
so, and he's gotta really
dry sense of humor.

85
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,890
He'll tell you a joke, and
you'll get it like two days later

86
00:04:39,893 --> 00:04:40,999
(laughter)

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,879
- I met Richard years ago,

88
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,019
along the outdoor writer trail somewhere.

89
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,460
And we just kind of, seemed to hit it off.

90
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:51,795
He's one of those gun writers that you'll,

91
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,559
I guess you'd call, entertaining,

92
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,009
would be a good word for it.

93
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,849
To have in camp and to go on hunts with.

94
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:01,599
And I can tell you, not
all gun writers are.

95
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,769
But Richard's always a
good one to have around.

96
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,429
- I've only emailed,
you know, communicated

97
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,169
with email with Luke, I
don't know him at all,

98
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,185
other than that he's with Gun Digest.

99
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,866
- [Richard] Well he's
the editor at Gun Digest.

100
00:05:14,895 --> 00:05:19,005
He's a hunter, he's a
life-long hunter, bow hunter.

101
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,709
And I was on his first ever rifle hunt,

102
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,579
like eight years ago, in Texas.

103
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,919
We were on a white, I
think it was his first

104
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,159
rifle hunt, ever.

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,569
- I hope he didn't teach
you any bad habits.

106
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,769
- Yeah, right.

107
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,919
- Here we are on this deer hunt,

108
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,889
and I figured out how to make the AR work.

109
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,119
And shot my deer with it,
and we got back to camp,

110
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,379
and I said, look, guys,
this is hard to swallow

111
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,659
and admit, but, I don't have
any idea how this thing works.

112
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,879
Right, I can run it,
it's like a NASCAR drive.

113
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,899
I can run the car, if I open up the hood,

114
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,180
I have no idea what's
happening here, right?

115
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,809
And Richard pulled me
aside, a few of us actually,

116
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,249
and sat down, very serious,

117
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,189
is the only time I think I ever
seen Richard overly-serious.

118
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,589
And walked me and then
these other people through

119
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,059
how this AR works, and of course,

120
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,849
things have blossomed like crazy.

121
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,299
And once I got in the Gun Digest,

122
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,280
well, he was one of the first guys

123
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:03,879
who I brought on board to really get down

124
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,000
and be a hard-core technician for handgun.

125
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,259
- Hey Geoff, Thys has just radioed
and said the clients are on their way.

126
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,090
- Okay, perfect.

127
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,609
Richard, it's time to go now,

128
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,109
guys are over seeing camp.

129
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,270
Let's head down this
hill and go meet them.

130
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,808
(upbeat music)

131
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,519
- You ready? Let's pack up.

132
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,650
- You said now.

133
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:31,951
- Yes, that means it's now.

134
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:33,459
- Not in Africa.

135
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,899
Every time I ask you
to do something for me,

136
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,514
you say, "I'll do it now."

137
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:37,915
And then like an hour
later, I ask you again,

138
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:39,587
and say, "I said I would do it now."

139
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:41,519
- Well, I probably say
that I do it now-now.

140
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,449
We have now, now-now, and just now.

141
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,669
- Well what is the difference?

142
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,729
- Now is now.

143
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,249
Now-now could be in an hour.

144
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,919
And just now could be tomorrow.

145
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,750
- Or next week.

146
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:50,883
- Or next week, you know.

147
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,760
- All right, let's go.

148
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,706
(dramatic music)

149
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,409
- Get all the luggage sorted out?

150
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,600
- Finally, you know, right,

151
00:07:10,602 --> 00:07:11,852
the game's the same without you.

152
00:07:11,853 --> 00:07:13,479
I'm glad you're here.

153
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,445
Luke, good to see ya.

154
00:07:15,446 --> 00:07:16,276
- This place is so beautiful,

155
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,509
not even you could ruin it.

156
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:18,589
(laughter)

157
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,119
- Welcome to Africa.

158
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,269
Hey, old man.

159
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,100
- Hi, Richard (chuckles).

160
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:22,941
- You're getting grayer than me.

161
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,136
- A little bit, I'm kind of getting there.

162
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,259
- C'mon, I'll show you the camp,

163
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,090
show you the PH's.

164
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:30,679
- (speaking in a foreign language).

165
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,570
Mark, how you feeling?

166
00:07:32,572 --> 00:07:34,300
- You guys, our hunters our here.

167
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,747
- [Group] Welcome, welcome guys.

168
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:36,598
(chuckles)

169
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,068
- I'm glad to see you.
- We're great.

170
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,758
- You all know, Bat, my son.

171
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,295
- Good to met you, Batman.

172
00:07:41,303 --> 00:07:42,203
- This is Alfredo Rico.

173
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:43,043
- Hey, hey.
- How you doing?

174
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:44,196
- Hey good.

175
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,340
- Joe Arterburn, and Luke Hartle.

176
00:07:45,344 --> 00:07:46,182
- How you doing, Joey?

177
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:47,007
- Leon?
- Luke.

178
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,359
- Very nice.
- Hey, Luke.

179
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,139
- Alfredo, you'll be hunting with Mark.

180
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,970
- Okay.

181
00:07:51,973 --> 00:07:53,392
- Joe, you'll be hunting with Leon, here,

182
00:07:53,393 --> 00:07:54,333
will be your guide.

183
00:07:54,334 --> 00:07:56,439
Luke, we got you with Marten, got taste.

184
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,400
- Why do I always get the guy

185
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:58,805
who looks like a mountain goat?

186
00:07:58,806 --> 00:07:59,636
(laughter)

187
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:01,616
- [Luke] I am not geared for speed at all.

188
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:02,447
(laughter)

189
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,280
- [Luke] Not at all.

190
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:05,532
- So, you all, get acquainted with them.

191
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:08,419
They gonna get your gear, take
you to show you your tents,

192
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,529
and yeah, and when, as
soon as you guys are ready,

193
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:12,659
we'll get, grab rifles
and go to the range.

194
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,060
Get zero'd, and get hunting
as soon as possible.

195
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:17,949
(dramatic music)

196
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,059
- [Richard] A trip to
Africa is long and grueling.

197
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,559
And when you travel with firearms,

198
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,960
the stress is compounded.

199
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,369
You do not want to begin your safari

200
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,439
without thoroughly
checking your equipment,

201
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,759
to make sure it was
not damaged in transit.

202
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,719
On this safari, all of the hunters

203
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,179
are using Mossberg rifles,

204
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,689
and the Sigsauer BDX
digital optical system.

205
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,029
The system uses a ballistic
calculator and bluetooth.

206
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,959
To help hunters be more successful

207
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,050
by instantly determining hold over.

208
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,219
(upbeat music)

209
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,869
- Hi guys, welcome to one
of our shooting ranges

210
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,779
that we have here at
the airport, Richmond.

211
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,329
We chose this specifically
for the BDX system

212
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,969
that you guys are gonna be using.

213
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,759
This is our pan area, it
used to be an old lake bed.

214
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,570
And, it's about 650-700
acres of nothing but sand.

215
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,019
There's a small little
succulent that grows here,

216
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,539
that the animals really love,

217
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,739
but that's about all that grows here,

218
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,430
cause the soil is so salty.

219
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,619
We've got steel out to four hundred.

220
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,369
We've got paper at 50, check zeros.

221
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,859
And yeah, the BDX system,

222
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,489
I'll give that to Richard
to explain to you.

223
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,079
- [Richard] Yeah, so, obviously
I was hunting yesterday.

224
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,419
I did this a couple of days ago.

225
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,969
We come out and run through this course

226
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,739
with the BDX system, and
the rifle that I had,

227
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,379
we were perfect all the
way out to four hundred.

228
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,779
Does everybody here already zero'd

229
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,319
before you got on the plane?

230
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,384
- Yes.

231
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:40,925
- [Richard] Hopefully
the bi-polar gorillas

232
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,260
at the airport didn't destroy your zero.

233
00:09:43,264 --> 00:09:44,755
(chuckles)
- Not a chance.

234
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:46,326
- [Richard] Yeah, so,
ideally what we'd like to do,

235
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,069
is you step up to the
bench, confirm your zero,

236
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,099
and then, we'll try to
make sure that the PH's

237
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,789
BDX range finding system,
whether it's the binocular,

238
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,089
or the range-finder, is
communicating with your scope,

239
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,689
and then, you're getting
hits to four hundred.

240
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,129
Or whatever it is that
you're comfortable with.

241
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,989
If you don't wanna shoot
to four, that's fine,

242
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,279
it's your hunt.

243
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,259
But just make sure that
they're communicating,

244
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,839
the devices are communicating,
and then make sure

245
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,549
that you and the PH are communicating,

246
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,029
so you know that he's ranged, etc., etc.

247
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,729
And we'll just one at a
time run you through it,

248
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,109
and as soon as you're
done, we'll go hunting.

249
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,260
- Cool.
- Sounds good.

250
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,459
- [Luke] The Sig BDX is
one of those products,

251
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,990
or a cluster of products, if you will,

252
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,959
that really revolutionizes,

253
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,919
and I don't use that word
lightly, revolutionizes.

254
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,139
Revolutionizes Kentucky hold-over.

255
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,239
- Okay, Luke, let's see
if the rifle still zero'd.

256
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,497
- You are.

257
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:42,998
- I'm interested to see how
the new BDX system works.

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,830
- Yeah, me too.

259
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,602
Would it be easiest if you called it with,

260
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,339
because we're paired up with your bino's.

261
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,009
- Yes.
- If you called it.

262
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,500
- I think I'll call
the range, and confirm.

263
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:52,657
- I will confirm, I'll repeat it back.

264
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,900
- But I think first,
let's go to a hundred.

265
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,079
See if the rifle zeros,

266
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,856
and then you'll check out the Sig system.

267
00:11:02,857 --> 00:11:04,017
- You got it.

268
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,889
- Your phone works as the brain.

269
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,109
Put in your rifle's ballistic data,

270
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,669
that talks to the range finder.

271
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,869
Those two talk together and
talk to the rifle's scope,

272
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,359
to really help eliminate
some of the messiness

273
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,069
that goes on upstairs
in that moment of truth

274
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,018
when you're trying to figure
out what the holdover is,

275
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:19,907
and the animal's moving

276
00:11:19,908 --> 00:11:22,227
and the wind's potentially busting around.

277
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,069
Anything you can do to simply that,

278
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,130
which the BDX system does, is a God send.

279
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,129
(rifle fires)

280
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,960
- Dead on it.

281
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,898
(rifle clicks)

282
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,229
- [Luke] All right, so
I'm gonna turn this on.

283
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,480
- [Thys] Let's go to 200.

284
00:11:43,456 --> 00:11:46,036
(rifle clicks)

285
00:11:47,454 --> 00:11:49,839
Okay, I have a confirmed range of 200.

286
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,670
You received it.

287
00:11:52,331 --> 00:11:53,161
- [Luke] I do.

288
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:55,984
- [Thys] Okay, when you're ready.

289
00:11:57,852 --> 00:11:59,651
(rifle fires)

290
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:01,398
(upbeat music)

291
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,904
(rifle clicks)

292
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:04,655
- [Thys] Ready to go.

293
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:06,635
Perfect.

294
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:07,468
- That's what it's supposed
to sound like, isn't it?

295
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:08,301
- Yeah.

296
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:09,674
- Let's take one at three, shall we?

297
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:12,575
- Okay let's do that.

298
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,999
Okay confirm to three hundred.

299
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,670
- Three hundred confirmed.

300
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:18,423
(dramatic music)

301
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,997
(rifle fires)

302
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:24,138
- Good, got it.

303
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,070
- Did I hit?

304
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:26,470
- Yeah, perfect.
- Perfect.

305
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,590
- That's good stuff, that is cool,

306
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,069
I have to think about
holdover, I can just see it.

307
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,009
- Good, and the system works perfectly.

308
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,890
- Oh, dude.

309
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:38,229
- You can see the radical changing.

310
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,554
- That's fantastic.

311
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:42,135
(upbeat music)

312
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,337
(rifle fires and clicks)

313
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:52,918
(lively music)

314
00:12:58,261 --> 00:13:00,761
(rifle fires)

315
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,288
(lively music)

316
00:13:06,306 --> 00:13:08,566
- Okay guys, rifles are sighted.

317
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,499
Everyone's comfortable
with the BDX system.

318
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,950
We've seen its working great.

319
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:15,220
PH's are paired up with plan scopes.

320
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,949
I think that's it, I think
let's get into the field.

321
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,209
There's kudus waiting.

322
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,198
- Great.
- Let's get on.

323
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,126
- [Luke] I've been waiting
a long time for this.

324
00:13:22,127 --> 00:13:22,956
(chuckles)

325
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:23,789
- Let's do it.

326
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,410
(dramatic music)

327
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:42,948
- Then this morning, we're
gonna climb this ridge.

328
00:13:42,949 --> 00:13:44,365
- Okay.

329
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:46,426
- Okay, we're gonna have to get on top,

330
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:47,985
plan getting a good look.

331
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:48,816
- Okay.

332
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:49,949
- You'll see something new.

333
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,977
- All right, sounds good.

334
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,557
(dramatic music)

335
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:54,578
- [Alfredo] It's on the first morning,

336
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,329
we went up Kudo mountain,

337
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:59,869
and I was carrying my 30
pound bag of camera gear,

338
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,300
and it was gonna be rough for me.

339
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:12,755
(dramatic music)

340
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:38,431
- [Alfredo] Gorgeous up here.

341
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:40,950
- [Alfredo] I was feeling winded,

342
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:43,399
and we were just at the base.

343
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,459
I later realized that we were starting

344
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,989
at about at a 35 hundred foot elevation.

345
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,990
(heavy breathing)
(dramatic music)

346
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,790
- [Mark] Alfredo?

347
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:07,633
- [Alfredo] Yeah?

348
00:15:07,634 --> 00:15:10,146
- I'll check on George,
he spotted some Kudu.

349
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,980
- Oh, awesome.

350
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:11,871
- We need to go over this ridge.

351
00:15:11,872 --> 00:15:12,700
- Okay.

352
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:15,502
- [Mark] What side of the hill are they?

353
00:15:15,503 --> 00:15:16,327
Okay, good.

354
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,759
- Alfredo, just wait there for me, okay?

355
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,249
- [Alfredo] You know they're close,

356
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,759
and you just can't wait
to start stalking them,

357
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,695
and approach them, and to
see how close you can get.

358
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:39,466
(dramatic music)

359
00:15:39,468 --> 00:15:42,638
(lively guitar music)

360
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,969
- [Joe] I've always been
enamored with Africa

361
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,459
since early days, reading
about it for years and years,

362
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,829
so, when this opportunity came,

363
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,439
I just immediately said yes,

364
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,559
I didn't even ask when,
or any other details,

365
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,329
just, yes, I'll go.

366
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,689
There's just something about Africa,

367
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,749
that, you know, having
read about it so much,

368
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,419
and then once you're actually there,

369
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,059
and you're start hunting,
and you start seeing

370
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,979
the animals, it really
starts to soak in that,

371
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,599
man, this is Africa, this
is kind of what you've

372
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,000
always been dreaming about.

373
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:25,686
(heavy breathing)

374
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,360
- My PH was Leon Du Plessis.

375
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,399
And Leon is my kind of
guy, my kind of hunter.

376
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,219
Leon's very knowledgeable
about what he's doing.

377
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,229
Very experienced about what he's doing.

378
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:41,279
But he also knows how to make
the experience enjoyable.

379
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,879
- So what we're gonna to do is,

380
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,889
they will stick to the cover,

381
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,858
because you do not see them in the open.

382
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:48,339
So slowly take a walk down the end

383
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,537
and see what we can find.

384
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:50,368
- Okay.

385
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,419
- [Joe] Our over-all strategy for day one,

386
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,529
was to set out from camp,

387
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,909
and I asked Leon what are we looking for,

388
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,959
and he said whatever we find.

389
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,769
I didn't think that was
such a great answer,

390
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,939
but turns out, he was right.

391
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,120
A kudu is high on my list,

392
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:12,067
but definitely was looking for zebra too,

393
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,219
so it was just sort of a
matter of going out there

394
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,450
and sorting through the
animals that we would see.

395
00:17:19,383 --> 00:17:24,383
(upbeat music)
(heavy breathing)

396
00:17:41,949 --> 00:17:46,949
(heavy breathing)
(dramatic music)

397
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:04,518
Look at that kudu.

398
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,599
- [Joe] So we got to the
top of that first koppie.

399
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,159
and kind of followed along the ridge.

400
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,029
We got to the point of the ridge,

401
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,399
We kind of spooked some zebra
that were down in this valley,

402
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,980
and I just thought, this is Africa,

403
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:19,021
now I know why I'm in Africa.

404
00:18:24,334 --> 00:18:25,504
- [Leon] Okay.

405
00:18:44,055 --> 00:18:46,355
He is, yeah, behind the cow now.

406
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:49,113
(dramatic music)

407
00:18:54,124 --> 00:18:55,544
- [Leon] See him?

408
00:19:06,293 --> 00:19:11,130
(dramatic music)
(heavy breathing)

409
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:12,831
- [Leon] Yeah, pull a bit up.

410
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:17,830
(heavy breathing)
(dramatic music)

411
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:39,326
(dramatic music)
(heavy breathing)

412
00:19:42,897 --> 00:19:46,186
(rifle fires)

413
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:48,937
(dramatic music)

414
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:53,276
(rifle clicks)

415
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:01,287
- Whadday think?

416
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:02,468
- Let's give it a minute,

417
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:04,799
I think, let's just go over.

418
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,337
- [Joe] Good shot?

419
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:11,088
(dramatic music)

420
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,529
- So when I shot, it's
kind of on that hard rest,

421
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,699
so it kind of kicked me
out the sight picture,

422
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:24,520
so by the time I got back
down, the kudu were gone.

423
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:27,044
- It was a good shot, Doug.

424
00:20:27,045 --> 00:20:29,520
No, it's not that one, it's the other one.

425
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,879
Okay, lets just grab some
water, and then we'll walk up.

426
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,910
- What's that?

427
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:36,101
- Let's grab some water,
and we'll walk down.

428
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:38,542
Be only two seconds.

429
00:20:38,544 --> 00:20:41,714
(lively guitar music)

430
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,519
- [Luke] For whatever
reason I remember it vivdly

431
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,869
when Richard called to ask
if I could make the trip

432
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,609
to Africa, it was a Tuesday afternoon,

433
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,216
and he never actually just
calls, he'll text me and say,

434
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:57,137
"Can you talk."

435
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,629
And so then I pick up the
phone, and I call him back.

436
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,269
And oh, and he says, "Luke,
I need ya in two weeks.

437
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:04,557
"I need you to get on a
plane and go to Africa."

438
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,179
And I busted out laughing,
and I said, "And volunteer?

439
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,446
"My wife is gonna castrate me.

440
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,857
"There's no way I can go
to Africa in two weeks."

441
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,486
And his, of course, knee-jerk
response, knowing Richard, was

442
00:21:13,487 --> 00:21:14,477
"Well, you've got three kids.

443
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:16,407
"You don't need them any more, any way."

444
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:19,731
(upbeat music)

445
00:21:19,732 --> 00:21:22,659
(music drowns out conversation)

446
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,910
- Fat guy coming through.

447
00:21:31,782 --> 00:21:33,900
(laughter)

448
00:21:33,901 --> 00:21:36,839
- That's as easy as that.

449
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,090
- Float like a butterfly.

450
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,350
- Well, you make that look easy, too.

451
00:21:41,351 --> 00:21:44,067
(chuckles)

452
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:45,568
- All right, then.

453
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,320
(upbeat music)

454
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:00,054
- I guess so.

455
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,350
I got plenty, you know.

456
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,520
(upbeat music)

457
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,548
- [Geoffrey] You see them?

458
00:22:24,055 --> 00:22:25,045
(chuckles)

459
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,569
- Their tails really do
stick straight up in the air,

460
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:29,060
when they run, don't they?
- Yeah.

461
00:22:31,024 --> 00:22:33,614
(lively music)

462
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,375
(upbeat music)

463
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:44,258
(dramatic music)

464
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:49,387
(board clicks)

465
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,579
- Hi dude.

466
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,050
- Hi guys, what's happening?

467
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,257
- (big sigh)

468
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,090
- Tired?

469
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:56,550
- My PH sucks.

470
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:57,875
(laughter)

471
00:23:57,876 --> 00:23:58,706
- I told you that.

472
00:23:58,709 --> 00:23:59,539
- I don't know what
your hiring process is,

473
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:00,572
but you need to revamp it.

474
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,389
It was good though, it was really good.

475
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,269
I mean, the BDX, placed
Sig Sauer in the critters.

476
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,679
- I'd told you, you'd like it, man.

477
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,099
- Did you see anything?

478
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,439
- Yeah, we were into kudu all day long.

479
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,839
Just nothing that we were looking for.

480
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,689
- So you're being choosy?

481
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,889
- You know they all taste the same.

482
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,029
- Well.

483
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,399
- Thys, can you not find him.

484
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,829
- Are you discussing me again?

485
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,390
- Can you not find him a suitable bull?

486
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,439
- Use smaller words, I
don't know that suitable

487
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,444
is gonna register.
(laughter)

488
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:27,065
- Well, the bulls on, they're everywhere.

489
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,845
It's undeniable that they're there, but--

490
00:24:28,846 --> 00:24:29,676
- But have you've seen one?

491
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:30,819
Have you seen a bull and said,

492
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:33,597
"Luke, would you like to shoot this bull?"

493
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,779
- No, I have not offered that question.

494
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,759
- You haven't given him an option.

495
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,869
- I feel like we're been in the nursery.

496
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,679
So we need to broaden
our horizons with this.

497
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,360
- Maybe tomorrow, we must
just go to another part.

498
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:44,625
(laughter)

499
00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:45,459
- Mm-hm, it was good.

500
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:47,901
- But it's been good, we've
seen a lot of animals.

501
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:49,990
- Saw my first zebra on the hoof today.

502
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,869
How does a critter that
white in this red soil,

503
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:54,810
stay that white?

504
00:24:54,811 --> 00:24:56,089
I say, it seems impossible, doesn't it?

505
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,999
- [Richard] Go look,
they're actually black.

506
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,589
- [Geoffrey] But the other half is white.

507
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,169
- [Richard] You're
looking at the wrong end.

508
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,049
- You did see it off the right, though.

509
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,050
- Well, that's true.

510
00:25:05,035 --> 00:25:06,165
- Dude, it got washed, it took a shower.

511
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,229
- It took a bath.

512
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,170
- Hi boys.
- Hi, man.

513
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:10,290
- Mr. Hemmingway.

514
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:11,809
- How nice to see you boys again.

515
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,260
Where's the horse that goes with that hat?

516
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:14,489
(laughter)

517
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:15,470
- [Richard] The horse he rode in.

518
00:25:15,471 --> 00:25:17,299
(laughter)

519
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:18,141
- [Geoffrey] Where's the horse,

520
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,598
the six shooter that goes with that.

521
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,649
With a necktie?

522
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,019
- Oh I've got the six-shooter.

523
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,850
- I don't doubt that.

524
00:25:22,853 --> 00:25:24,042
- Don't worry about that.

525
00:25:24,043 --> 00:25:26,440
- Good day, bad day, long day, short day.

526
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,180
- Well, it was, I tell you what boys.

527
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:32,349
I went through the full
gamut of emotions today.

528
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:34,969
Started out on the highest high.

529
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:38,167
- Love when you saw Leon come
out of the tent this morning.

530
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:39,308
- Well, let's start after that.

531
00:25:39,312 --> 00:25:41,855
(laughter)

532
00:25:41,856 --> 00:25:42,786
- How it always started out great,

533
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,699
we were in the coolest
critters right off the bat.

534
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,610
I mean, we walked out, out of camp here,

535
00:25:48,611 --> 00:25:49,861
and now we're probably
a couple miles from camp

536
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:53,799
up in the mountains, and
then kind of continue

537
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:58,029
over the hill, and then there
was a zebra down below us.

538
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,620
Then there were kudu over here.

539
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,409
It was just, you know, one of those

540
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,340
heart-pounding type of deals,

541
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:08,446
and so it, just really, really cool.

542
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:11,100
- I just knew guys, I told
you, you'd love it here.

543
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:12,509
- And you, unlike the states,

544
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,500
when you see something move,

545
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:15,380
you never know exactly what it's gonna be.

546
00:26:15,383 --> 00:26:16,223
I mean, if you're hunting elk, right?

547
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:17,936
If something moves, it's usually an elk.

548
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,930
You might see a muley in there.

549
00:26:18,931 --> 00:26:20,359
If you're out in white-tail,
it's gonna be a white-tail.

550
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,420
Here, it's like, it could be anything.

551
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:23,341
- Yeah.

552
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:27,446
- And I get excited, I grab
Leon's arm, and warthogs.

553
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:28,765
(laughter)

554
00:26:28,766 --> 00:26:29,746
(excited cross-talk chatter)

555
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:31,278
- Remember, it's cool, it's something new.

556
00:26:31,284 --> 00:26:32,666
- Warthogs.

557
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:34,097
- Normally it would be
the opposite reaction.

558
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,739
(laughter)

559
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,159
- Wait, you saw warthogs?

560
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,990
- I didn't see.

561
00:26:38,993 --> 00:26:40,153
- And he didn't take your gun?

562
00:26:40,154 --> 00:26:41,369
(laughter)

563
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,680
- I was holding on firmly.

564
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:44,305
(laughter)

565
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,520
- I know his reputation.

566
00:26:46,402 --> 00:26:47,292
- It sounds like there's a story in it.

567
00:26:47,293 --> 00:26:49,329
- Well, there's more to the story.

568
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,029
So we were kind of on a
rocky point overlooking them

569
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:54,499
and so I was moving
into shooting position,

570
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,500
and Leon was ranging them with
his range-finder, his BDX.

571
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,029
It was 193 yards.

572
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,809
I couldn't, I was gonna take a shot,

573
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:05,199
and if I were to shot that one--

574
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,469
- Uh-huh, you would have had trouble.

575
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,309
- I would have shot that top off a rock

576
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,639
that was in front of me,

577
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,549
so I had to re-position and get up higher.

578
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,279
And I had a pretty nice rest,

579
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,839
and Leon led me into him,
and it was sort of like,

580
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,260
you know, the one right behind the cow.

581
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:26,499
Shot, good solid hit, we
kind of, ya-hoo'd, you know,

582
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,179
but, one of those deals,

583
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,954
and so we settled back for a little bit.

584
00:27:30,955 --> 00:27:31,785
- Mm-hm.

585
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:33,658
- Would you say, so we
had a drink of water.

586
00:27:33,662 --> 00:27:35,930
- Yeah, we had a drink
of water, relaxed a bit.

587
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:37,671
- Relaxed a little bit, and
we down to look for him.

588
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:40,850
Thought he'd be piled up
down at the base of the hill.

589
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:43,595
(dramatic music)

590
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,850
- But he wasn't there, and
so then, the tracking was on.

591
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:31,614
(dramatic music)

592
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,418
- [Joe] All day, we've been
looking for that animal,

593
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,436
and we haven't found him yet.

594
00:28:46,437 --> 00:28:48,387
And so that's why I said, you know,

595
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,429
the highest high to the lowest low,

596
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,209
it's just that we had to come in at dark,

597
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,219
and we have to go out, we're
gonna go luck for him tomorrow.

598
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,269
I'm expecting a sleepless night.

599
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,698
- Good evening, good evening.

600
00:28:59,699 --> 00:29:01,226
(excited crosstalk chatter)

601
00:29:01,227 --> 00:29:02,735
- And we made in.

602
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:03,566
- How are you guys?

603
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:04,399
- Excellent.

604
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:05,242
- Thought y'all gave up and went to town.

605
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,525
(laughter)

606
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:07,360
- We like nights.

607
00:29:07,363 --> 00:29:08,932
- You guys staying out late tonight.

608
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:10,329
- You guys see anything?

609
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:12,529
- Oh, we saw a lot.

610
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,310
Beautiful mountain zebras, a whole herd.

611
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,320
Saw the blessed, sorry, it's late.

612
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,000
Blesbok.

613
00:29:22,001 --> 00:29:23,967
- And that was just the afternoon.

614
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,489
- And what happened in the morning?

615
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,970
- Morning, kudu, kudu, kudu.

616
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,190
And then found a nice duiker.

617
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:32,261
- Oh yeah, got something.
(laughter)

618
00:29:32,262 --> 00:29:34,269
- Yes.
- Mark, did you know,

619
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,730
there's a bit of a size
difference, though.

620
00:29:35,731 --> 00:29:36,959
(laughter)
- Yeah.

621
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:38,711
- Did you misjudge that, duiker?

622
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:40,279
(laughter)

623
00:29:40,282 --> 00:29:41,222
- You know what a gold-medal
duiker looks like?

624
00:29:41,223 --> 00:29:42,232
- He was looking for the games rack.

625
00:29:42,233 --> 00:29:43,297
Just one of their horns.

626
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:44,158
(laughter)

627
00:29:44,163 --> 00:29:46,184
- The horn's like this.

628
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:48,105
- Straight-horn.
(laughter)

629
00:29:48,108 --> 00:29:50,938
(heavy breathing)

630
00:30:08,978 --> 00:30:11,488
- Okay, We should follow
the straight line.

631
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:12,319
- Okay.

632
00:30:12,322 --> 00:30:13,160
- Are you okay?

633
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:13,985
- Yeah.

634
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:16,905
I'll live.

635
00:30:16,906 --> 00:30:18,456
- And run across the open area.

636
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:21,328
And gonna catch them when
they get to the front.

637
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:22,174
- Yeah.

638
00:30:24,747 --> 00:30:26,217
- See the turtle?

639
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,050
Tortoise.

640
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,460
(heavy breathing)

641
00:30:38,126 --> 00:30:40,506
- [Alfredo] Yeah, I thought
you were calling me a turtle.

642
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:43,339
(heavy breathing)

643
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,430
- Flat on the bottom.

644
00:30:58,431 --> 00:30:59,570
- [Alfredo] Yeah.

645
00:30:59,572 --> 00:31:00,412
- Female.

646
00:31:08,856 --> 00:31:09,686
- Okay, okay, beautiful.

647
00:31:12,018 --> 00:31:15,188
(footsteps crunching)

648
00:31:17,283 --> 00:31:21,623
- (Speaking in a foreign language).

649
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,880
- So this is the opening
that you are talking about?

650
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:27,241
- No, it was at the bottom.

651
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:28,084
- Oh, okay.

652
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:30,797
- But they broke left,
and they run up we know.

653
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,070
They're going for this thick bush.

654
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,389
- [Alfredo] A duiker is a pygmy antelope.

655
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,629
It's very small.

656
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,489
George, the tracker, first spotted it.

657
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,009
And I remember his face when he looked,

658
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,769
when he saw it, he goes,
oh, he turned around

659
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,820
with a big ole smile, and goes, "Oh wow."

660
00:31:55,218 --> 00:31:56,048
- [Alfredo] All the way back there.

661
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:58,631
- [Mark] Yeah, way back there.

662
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,779
- Mark goes, that's a gold-medal duiker,

663
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,539
you need to shoot that.

664
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,649
Thing was is, that wasn't on our list

665
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:13,639
of three animals that we got to shoot.

666
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,669
It was outside that list,

667
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,949
so that meant, it would
come, the cost of it,

668
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,350
would come out of my pocket.

669
00:32:30,945 --> 00:32:35,445
- We can come get ready, all
right, George, get ready.

670
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,850
- [Alfredo] And what went
through my brain was,

671
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,029
that's a small animal,

672
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,619
and probably the smallest animals

673
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,009
are gonna be the most costly animals.

674
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:48,309
And I was thinking, oh, am I gonna,

675
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,810
is that a three thousand
dollar animal (chuckles)?

676
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:01,324
- Trust me, it won't break the bank.

677
00:33:01,325 --> 00:33:03,575
(laughter)

678
00:33:07,323 --> 00:33:10,073
(dramatic music)

679
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:20,149
- This thing's off, so I
got to the front of it.

680
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:38,379
- [Alfredo] I was using Mark's sticks,

681
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,719
and I wasn't used to the sticks.

682
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,170
I was used to my sticks.

683
00:33:42,449 --> 00:33:46,446
And with his sticks, you
have to grab the sticks,

684
00:33:46,447 --> 00:33:48,434
and then hold the rifle.

685
00:33:48,435 --> 00:33:52,305
My sticks, I put my rifle on the sticks,

686
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,899
I loop my arm through the sling.

687
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:59,139
And I bared down on the scope,
like this, when I shoot.

688
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,099
So it creates a very
stable platform for me.

689
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,370
And so I'm pushing down.

690
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,030
With Mark's sticks, I tried that,

691
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,029
because that's what I'm used to,

692
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,449
and the legs just spread apart,

693
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,500
and I was all wonky like this (chuckles).

694
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:15,886
And Mark looked at me,

695
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:17,379
like what the hell's wrong with you?

696
00:34:41,627 --> 00:34:43,407
- Sorry, causing problems.

697
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:45,411
I'm used to doing this--

698
00:34:55,986 --> 00:34:56,816
- Yeah.

699
00:34:57,734 --> 00:35:00,484
(dramatic music)

700
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:23,717
(dramatic music)

701
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:35,998
(intense loud music)

702
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,879
(rifle fires)

703
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,710
- Oh!

704
00:35:39,713 --> 00:35:40,553
- He's good, he's good.

705
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,860
Give him time.

706
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,060
- I'm glad that was not a kudu (chuckles).

707
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:54,800
- Why?

708
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:56,049
- Lot a give.

709
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,297
- Oh yeah.

710
00:35:57,298 --> 00:35:58,128
- Dancing around.

711
00:35:58,131 --> 00:35:59,011
- Yeah, yeah (chuckles).

712
00:36:00,203 --> 00:36:01,623
- And he goes, he showed me the technique,

713
00:36:01,624 --> 00:36:03,300
and I was still a little wobbly.

714
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:06,536
And I still had a circle going there.

715
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,140
And I was able to calm it down.

716
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,339
And pull the trigger.

717
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,949
- As a matter of interest.

718
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:12,780
- Yes.

719
00:36:12,783 --> 00:36:15,609
- Duiker, very tough to hunt.

720
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,440
- Okay.

721
00:36:16,443 --> 00:36:17,373
- Very elusive.

722
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:18,769
- Okay.

723
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,019
- Late afternoon, early morning,

724
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,839
best time to hunt them.

725
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,109
We're in mid-day,

726
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:29,099
we caught this very, very
good representative, eating.

727
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:29,930
- Okay.

728
00:36:29,933 --> 00:36:31,213
- You can thank me later.

729
00:36:31,214 --> 00:36:33,169
(laughter)

730
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,000
Well done, man.

731
00:36:34,939 --> 00:36:35,899
Great to break the ice.

732
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:36,730
- Yeah.

733
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,169
Mark was very right about that duiker.

734
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,999
It was a beautiful animal.

735
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,100
It did not cost me three thousand dollars.

736
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,530
Fuck!

737
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,960
- Alfredo.

738
00:36:56,963 --> 00:36:57,989
- Yes.

739
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,119
- Congratulations.

740
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,950
- Thank you.

741
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,789
- And I said to you,
you can thank me later.

742
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,620
- Okay.

743
00:37:04,546 --> 00:37:05,656
- It is a beautiful duiker.

744
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:06,499
- Okay.

745
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,450
- Not easy to hunt.

746
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,210
Beautiful.

747
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,600
(reflective music)

748
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,059
- [Alfredo] Wow, that's a lot of damage.

749
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,439
Beautiful.

750
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,400
Totally worth it.

751
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:24,379
And that just made me trust
his opinion that much more.

752
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,280
- There's no guessing here,

753
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:27,929
but you have yourself a gold-medal duiker.

754
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:28,760
- [Alfredo] Really?

755
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:30,409
- Really.

756
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:32,129
- Wow, so what's that mean?

757
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,709
What's a gold-medal, whadda mean?

758
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,305
I don't--

759
00:37:35,306 --> 00:37:38,676
- It's a form of measurement they use.

760
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,814
- [Alfredo] Yeah, okay.

761
00:37:39,815 --> 00:37:40,715
- The Safari Club International.

762
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,550
- [Alfredo] Okay.

763
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:46,443
- They will grade them,
either bronze, silver, gold.

764
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,299
Obviously gold is right in front.

765
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,130
- [Alfredo] Yes, right.

766
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:54,017
- And the measurement,
the form of measurement,

767
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,489
is by measuring the length of both horns.

768
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,370
- [Alfredo] Yes.

769
00:37:57,371 --> 00:37:59,309
- [Mark] Plus the
circumference of both horns.

770
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,649
- [Alfredo] Right.

771
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,889
- And as you can see this animal has

772
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,809
what we call secondary growth.

773
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,640
- [Alfredo] Right.

774
00:38:05,643 --> 00:38:07,202
- That last inch you see,

775
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:08,550
the lines very tight,

776
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,889
sign of maturity and old age.

777
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:15,369
- So, Alfredo, I've gotta ask you.

778
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,619
You hadn't been hunting,
you didn't grow up hunting.

779
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,869
- [Alfredo] No, I didn't.

780
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,530
- Your first trip to Africa.

781
00:38:21,422 --> 00:38:24,679
Your first African animal, free-range.

782
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,139
Tent camp.

783
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,439
How does it compare to some

784
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,140
of your other hunting experiences?

785
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,669
- [Alfredo] I had to work
really hard for this one.

786
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,280
So, I liked that a lot.

787
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:38,019
The only other thing that's come close is

788
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,319
a Texas out I done, that I did work.

789
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,259
The first day, full day that we hunted.

790
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:48,459
We hiked nine and half hours.

791
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:53,089
23 hundred foot elevation,
and 103 degree weather.

792
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,499
And got nothing.

793
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,069
- So what's your plan tomorrow, Mark?

794
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,900
- See the buck?

795
00:38:58,903 --> 00:38:59,743
Shoot the buck.

796
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,610
- Scout over and skeeto.
(laughter)

797
00:39:02,612 --> 00:39:03,907
- Keep it simple.

798
00:39:03,908 --> 00:39:04,974
- Keeping it simple.

799
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:05,805
- Scout them, and skeet them.

800
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:07,028
- That's what we should be doing.

801
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:10,919
(excited cross-talk chatter)

802
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,509
- Which means judge it and shoot it.

803
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,349
- Scout them and skeet them.

804
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,089
- You guys have a plan for tomorrow?

805
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:16,920
- I've learned--

806
00:39:16,923 --> 00:39:18,319
- Well, Richard and I have a plan.

807
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,150
- Okay.

808
00:39:19,153 --> 00:39:21,302
- We gonna try and help you guys.

809
00:39:21,303 --> 00:39:23,049
- I have a plan, I'm going to go,

810
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,899
first thing in, I'm gonna
go look for my kudu,

811
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,979
and I'm gonna find it.

812
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,459
- Well, we just hunting
warthog, and stuff like that,

813
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,009
so, we'll tag along with you.

814
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,010
- I appreciate that.

815
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,199
- Try and get some extra
trackers, and eyes in the field.

816
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,100
- Oh great.

817
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:39,049
Yeah, when I find him, then I can relax.

818
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,550
- Yeah, it's understandable.

819
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:45,279
- We'll go on a dang
drive, have some more fun.

820
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,879
- Try and see a gemsbok.

821
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,898
- And then we'll see if that
one that looks like that.

822
00:39:50,899 --> 00:39:52,369
(laughter)

823
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,610
- Straight horns.

824
00:39:53,613 --> 00:39:56,013
- But the difference is, it's that--

825
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,260
- We're gonna need a,
the drawing on the napkin

826
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:00,683
(laughter)
(excited crosstalk chatter)

827
00:40:00,684 --> 00:40:03,360
- Flashcards.
(laughter)

828
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,489
- Well, I hope you guys
have a great day tomorrow,

829
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,139
and Joe, I hope we find
your bull tomorrow.

830
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,499
I'll try my best.

831
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,339
I know Leon and the trackers
will try their best as well.

832
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,599
- I have all the faith in the world.

833
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,369
- Does anybody wanna go home early?

834
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,778
- Fuck, no.

835
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:20,029
(laughter)

836
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:25,858
- That's well said, cause I mean,

837
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,119
- I'm halfway around the world,

838
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,849
we've been hunting for like two days.

839
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,309
I feel like we've been
hunting together forever.

840
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:31,639
- Yeah, no, that's true.

841
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,610
- We're sitting on the rock today,

842
00:40:32,611 --> 00:40:35,675
and I think I said, this
is some Lion King shit.

843
00:40:35,676 --> 00:40:36,506
(laughter)

844
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:37,529
We weren't seeing any critters,

845
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,970
but I was so content, I didn't care.

846
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:41,809
(excited crosstalk chatter)

847
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,110
- [Luke] Getting to pull the trigger

848
00:40:43,114 --> 00:40:44,174
is gonna be a bonus at this point.

849
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,291
- [Thys] You know what,
he was sitting there,

850
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:51,290
and you kind of get used to
the scenery and everything.

851
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,110
But, every now and
again, and when you said,

852
00:40:57,111 --> 00:41:00,296
"I'm sitting here, looking at this scene,

853
00:41:00,297 --> 00:41:03,516
"and it feels as though I
should say something profound,

854
00:41:03,517 --> 00:41:04,697
"but nothing comes to mind."

855
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,330
Is just, Richard and I had this moment.

856
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,729
- [Thys] it's just a feeling.

857
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,680
- [Geoffrey] Luke, there's nothing to say

858
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:10,009
to describe what I was seeing.

859
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,630
- Next time just pick up that.

860
00:41:12,633 --> 00:41:14,899
(laughter)

861
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,530
- I can probably pick you up like that.

862
00:41:16,531 --> 00:41:17,565
(laughter)

863
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:18,604
- Ah, Sa-win-da.

864
00:41:18,605 --> 00:41:21,370
(laughter)

865
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:22,211
- Right away.

866
00:41:22,212 --> 00:41:23,036
(laughter)

867
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,369
- Right over here, the best in the world.

868
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,998
- I feel like we're still
building to that point.

869
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:27,316
- You know what, I'll
be taking the selfie.

870
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:29,569
(laughter)

871
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:36,668
- Well, Dave the reason--
- Let's do that tomorrow.

872
00:41:36,669 --> 00:41:38,935
- You haven't take selfies tomorrow?

873
00:41:38,936 --> 00:41:41,286
- Don't you do that?
(laughter)

874
00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:42,118
- No.
(laughter)

875
00:41:42,121 --> 00:41:46,170
- The video life of you will
be a hillbilly taking selfies.

876
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,458
- How do you do that?

877
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:49,307
- I'll show you later.

878
00:41:49,308 --> 00:41:50,207
(laughter)

879
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,468
- [Luke] You gotta do it
yourself, I can't do it to you.

880
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:54,206
(laughter)

881
00:41:54,207 --> 00:41:55,177
- It's the rule of the selfie.

882
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,080
- No, now I know what
you're talking about.

883
00:41:57,082 --> 00:41:58,092
It's nice to know what
you're talking about.

884
00:41:58,093 --> 00:42:00,149
- The problem is, there's a stick involved

885
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,250
most of the time.

886
00:42:01,251 --> 00:42:02,629
(laughter)

887
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,860
- You don't need any
instruments, you're hand will do.

888
00:42:06,252 --> 00:42:08,092
- First of all, it's
called a selfie stick.

889
00:42:08,093 --> 00:42:10,335
(laughter)

890
00:42:15,321 --> 00:42:19,201
- Take your selfie stick
and do it yourself.

891
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,587
- That's a wrap.

892
00:42:20,588 --> 00:42:22,295
(laughter)

893
00:42:22,296 --> 00:42:24,236
- I can see where this is going.

894
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,039
- Yeah, it's going downhill pretty fast.

895
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,349
- So obviously, this is the
reason I invited you all

896
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,949
to come here, the hunting, the territory,

897
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,589
but most importantly, the
guys that you gonna hunt with.

898
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,420
- It's huge.

899
00:42:36,491 --> 00:42:38,811
- Yeah, I've hunted with
a bunch of PH's in Africa,

900
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:42,059
and no place can you
come, and in 24 hours,

901
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,739
feel like you're hunting
with a buddy, your buddy.

902
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,700
Right?

903
00:42:45,701 --> 00:42:48,650
- [Geoffrey] And as an
outfitter, Thys might

904
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:49,531
not be the best.

905
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:52,575
(laughter)

906
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:53,422
- [Luke] I still can't
pronounce his name right.

907
00:42:53,423 --> 00:42:54,795
(laughter)

908
00:42:54,796 --> 00:42:59,436
- [Geoffrey] But, as an
outfitter, one of the key things

909
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,009
is not how many animals you shoot,

910
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,499
it's whether you wanna come back or not.

911
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,159
And a PH personality and
how he bonds with you,

912
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,369
plays a huge role in that.

913
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:08,240
- Let me say it like this,

914
00:43:08,241 --> 00:43:09,339
what I was trying to say before.

915
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,588
We came halfway around the
world, I feel like I'm home,

916
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:15,805
all right, and that's
what matters, really does.

917
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,700
- I'll drink cheers to that.

918
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:18,096
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

919
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:22,245
(dramatic music)

920
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,440
- [Mark] So, Alfredo.

921
00:43:27,443 --> 00:43:28,433
- [Alfredo] Yes?

922
00:43:28,434 --> 00:43:30,966
- There's a little tradition
we have in South Africa.

923
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:32,870
Being your first African animal.

924
00:43:32,871 --> 00:43:33,928
- Yes.

925
00:43:33,934 --> 00:43:37,274
- I'd like you to just lift up your cap.

926
00:43:39,629 --> 00:43:41,709
And it's just a sign to show that

927
00:43:41,712 --> 00:43:44,357
you're a successful hunter,

928
00:43:44,358 --> 00:43:46,178
and it's your first African animal.

929
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,010
- Awesome.

930
00:43:47,013 --> 00:43:48,013
- Congratulations.

931
00:43:48,013 --> 00:43:48,983
- Thank you.

932
00:43:48,984 --> 00:43:50,978
- Well done.
- Thank you.

933
00:43:53,463 --> 00:43:56,553
(African folk music)

934
00:44:47,276 --> 00:44:50,186
(cartridge clicks)

935
00:44:51,072 --> 00:44:54,162
(African folk music)

936
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:56,756
- You see, here.

937
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:59,811
Dude, stick this on your hat, so you see.

938
00:44:59,812 --> 00:45:02,475
- That's pretty cool, how's it go, oh.

939
00:45:02,476 --> 00:45:04,766
- You got the clip.

940
00:45:04,767 --> 00:45:07,177
- Wow, that's bad ass.

941
00:45:07,181 --> 00:45:10,261
(African folk music)

942
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:29,051
(saw blade rasps)

943
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:33,841
(African folk music)

944
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:42,809
- Mr. Mann.

945
00:45:42,812 --> 00:45:43,650
- Yes, sir.

946
00:45:43,651 --> 00:45:44,475
- See something?

947
00:45:44,478 --> 00:45:48,268
- See you, you're looking pretty snazzy.

948
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,438
- Well, I gotta thank you for that,

949
00:45:50,439 --> 00:45:52,015
hooking me up with the out back.

950
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,460
I mean, this Richmond
jacket is just so warm.

951
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:56,849
I mean, not only that,

952
00:45:56,852 --> 00:45:57,842
there's a two part story, for being,

953
00:45:57,843 --> 00:45:59,029
Fort Richmond Safaris.

954
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,900
- Richmond jacket.

955
00:45:59,901 --> 00:46:01,109
- Richmond jacket, you know.

956
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,409
- We needed a little class
in your life, you know.

957
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,299
- Well, we all can't be as classy as you.

958
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:08,429
- Well, I wore this, the
elephant jacket here,

959
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:09,924
this is the third year.

960
00:46:09,925 --> 00:46:10,755
I think it's kind of cool.

961
00:46:10,758 --> 00:46:12,208
People think that just
cause you're in Africa,

962
00:46:12,213 --> 00:46:14,753
that it's supposed to
be warm all the time.

963
00:46:14,754 --> 00:46:17,500
It's actually winter, or late fall here.

964
00:46:17,501 --> 00:46:18,331
- You know it gets cold here.

965
00:46:18,334 --> 00:46:19,374
- Yeah, I mean it gets cold.

966
00:46:19,375 --> 00:46:21,969
So, this jacket, or that one,

967
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,239
night time, early morning,

968
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,609
specially if you're on the back of a truck

969
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:27,044
or sitting up on one of
these hills glassing.

970
00:46:27,045 --> 00:46:27,875
- It's perfect, yeah.

971
00:46:27,878 --> 00:46:28,708
- Austrian-made.

972
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:30,231
This is high quality hunting gear.

973
00:46:30,232 --> 00:46:31,450
- Extremely high quality.

974
00:46:31,453 --> 00:46:33,662
I mean, I'm very impressed with.

975
00:46:33,663 --> 00:46:34,503
- Well, you look good in it.

976
00:46:34,504 --> 00:46:35,556
- Well, thank you.

977
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,419
- So, Geoffrey, I know, your clients,

978
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,939
especially first timers
when they come over here.

979
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,249
They're always asking you.

980
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,329
You know, what type of clothing.

981
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,539
Whadda, you gonna tell 'em?

982
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,769
- You'll gonna go all the way.

983
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,959
Boots, pants, shirts, and jackets.

984
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,479
- Loaded, toes to nose.

985
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:51,728
- Toes to nose.

986
00:46:51,729 --> 00:46:52,559
- There you go.

987
00:46:52,562 --> 00:46:54,261
- Well, talking about first time hunters,

988
00:46:54,262 --> 00:46:55,560
let's go test your skills.

989
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:00,760
- That's life, folks, shit happens.
