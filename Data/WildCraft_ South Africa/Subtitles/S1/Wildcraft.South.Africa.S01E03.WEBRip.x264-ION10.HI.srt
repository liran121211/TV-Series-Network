1
00:00:00,928 --> 00:00:05,028
- [Narrator] Previously,
on Wild Craft South Africa.

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,080
- [Leon] You still see him?

3
00:00:06,081 --> 00:00:07,805
- [Joe] Yeah,

4
00:00:07,812 --> 00:00:09,312
over by that bush.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:13,866
- Take a few deep breaths, Joe.

6
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:14,887
Look up the side of the hill,

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,087
just behind that bush,

8
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:16,918
- Yep.
- he's going to come

9
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:17,751
walking up on the left-hand

10
00:00:17,754 --> 00:00:18,614
side.
- Yep, yep, yep, yep.

11
00:00:18,615 --> 00:00:21,299
- Hold on a second, I'm
gonna get you a range.

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,907
You know, it's often when preparation

13
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,448
and everything just comes together.

14
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:27,867
Deep breaths, just gently
squeeze the trigger

15
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:28,698
whenever you're ready.

16
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:29,531
- Okay.

17
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,771
- And often on a hunt, when
everything goes smoothly,

18
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:36,596
you don't actually learn anything.

19
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,800
(gunshot)

20
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:42,837
- Good shot!

21
00:00:42,838 --> 00:00:43,668
Well done, Joe.

22
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:44,641
(laughs)

23
00:00:44,642 --> 00:00:47,655
- That's the bullet that sealed the deal.

24
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:48,969
- Well done, good for you.

25
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:50,631
(laughs)

26
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:52,731
- Finally.
- Shake my hand.

27
00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:53,572
- Finally.

28
00:00:53,573 --> 00:00:55,434
- Finally got him.

29
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:58,235
- Finally got him, kinda turned a one

30
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:01,029
day hunt into a two day rodeo.

31
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,479
- The full experience.

32
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,528
- The full African experience.,

33
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:07,124
(upbeat music)

34
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:13,366
(music intensifies)

35
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:27,901
(upbeat music resumes)

36
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:36,542
- For the hunter, an African
safari is the pinnacle

37
00:01:36,544 --> 00:01:38,414
of adventure.

38
00:01:38,415 --> 00:01:40,715
The wonder and mystery of
this beautiful landscape

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,139
is something to be cherished.

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,680
The animals are powerful,
regal, and a true

41
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:47,217
gift to mankind.

42
00:01:47,218 --> 00:01:49,247
Fort Richmond Safaris,
with their professional

43
00:01:49,248 --> 00:01:52,048
staff, and amazing concessions, can bring

44
00:01:52,054 --> 00:01:53,574
all of Africa together,

45
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:56,321
in an epic and unforgettable way.

46
00:01:58,809 --> 00:02:00,328
It was very special for me to be able

47
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:01,959
to share one of my favorite places,

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,088
and hunts,

49
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,697
with my outdoor writing friends.

50
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:08,338
Like the adventurers of old, now they too

51
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:10,641
can tell the world of this magnificent

52
00:02:10,642 --> 00:02:12,135
and magical place.

53
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,570
Several of us have
already found the trophies

54
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:18,528
to fuel the memories we set out to create.

55
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,866
However, it's the African experience,

56
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,317
and the camaraderie of the campfire that

57
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:24,992
ultimately becomes the truest, most

58
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:28,441
lasting, and most important trophy.

59
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,862
(slow music)

60
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:44,279
- All right, let's just
check to make sure.

61
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,266
I got into firearms late in life,

62
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:51,206
in terms of really learning,

63
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:52,817
wanting to learn how to use them.

64
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:54,691
And I have been fortunate
enough to have a lot

65
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:57,082
of training, top level training.

66
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,253
And I love shooting anything close,

67
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:02,121
to anything far.

68
00:03:02,123 --> 00:03:03,473
- Right, so it's still early morning.

69
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,065
- Right.

70
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,795
- And blesbok is high on the list.

71
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:08,644
- Yes.

72
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:09,495
- Okay.

73
00:03:09,498 --> 00:03:10,348
- We just saw them.

74
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:11,475
- You've just spotted them,

75
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:14,510
a nice little bachelor group of rams.

76
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:17,091
(upbeat music)

77
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:21,434
Here they go.

78
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:25,817
Nice bull, look at that bull.

79
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,369
- Now they are running the other way.

80
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,118
- Yeah, upwind, yeah.

81
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,940
- Well we found the blesbok.

82
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,878
- That's so beautiful.

83
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:52,265
They were just moving about, just grazing.

84
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,632
Just beautiful animals.

85
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,469
But there is an excitement
there seeing them,

86
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:58,151
like okay, yes, they're here.

87
00:03:58,153 --> 00:03:59,376
They're close by.

88
00:03:59,377 --> 00:04:00,867
Yeah, these shooting sticks helped out,

89
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:01,831
helped me out yesterday.

90
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:02,675
- They did well?

91
00:04:02,678 --> 00:04:03,508
- Yeah.

92
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:06,094
- Performed very well.

93
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:08,165
- This is what I work with at home,

94
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:11,350
and um, along with this sling.

95
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,001
This sling is really
nice, because what I do,

96
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,254
is I insert my arm into here like this,

97
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:21,836
and then when I get on top of the tripod,

98
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:23,682
I put it like this, so I have a lot

99
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:25,918
of downward pressure on it,

100
00:04:25,921 --> 00:04:28,717
and it keeps me really steady.

101
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:29,805
So that's, uh,

102
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:32,096
that's what I like about this combination.

103
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,850
This is a Versacarry rifle sling.

104
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:37,554
So very handy.

105
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:39,408
- [Mark] Very comfortable.

106
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:42,251
- Yeah, it's comfortable, and it's simple.

107
00:04:42,252 --> 00:04:43,112
You know?

108
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:45,346
Easy to throw my arm through.

109
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,020
(intense music)

110
00:04:49,734 --> 00:04:51,043
- [Mark] The sun is behind us, which is,

111
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:52,820
which helps.

112
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:54,397
We need our face.

113
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:55,228
- Yes.

114
00:04:55,231 --> 00:04:56,741
- And we're gonna slowly move through this

115
00:04:56,742 --> 00:04:59,779
treeline, and see if we can spot them.

116
00:04:59,781 --> 00:05:01,158
- Sounds good, let's get going.

117
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,447
- Trick is to get as close as possible.

118
00:05:02,448 --> 00:05:03,297
- Yes.

119
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:04,128
Of course.

120
00:05:18,614 --> 00:05:19,592
- Kori bustard.

121
00:05:19,593 --> 00:05:20,416
- Oh, wow.

122
00:05:37,316 --> 00:05:38,726
Stop, stop, stop.

123
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:55,804
It's a big group of blesbok.

124
00:05:58,404 --> 00:05:59,334
They are slowly walking.

125
00:05:59,335 --> 00:06:00,857
We're gonna catch them when they come.

126
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:01,711
- Okay.

127
00:06:01,712 --> 00:06:02,552
- Just very slowly.

128
00:06:02,553 --> 00:06:03,685
- Okay.

129
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,191
- Get in position.

130
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:15,629
It's like they hit a brick wall.

131
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,380
They smelled us there,

132
00:06:17,383 --> 00:06:18,882
and they go back.

133
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:21,082
- Yeah, I see that.

134
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,261
- They still don't know we're here,

135
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:23,087
so that's good.

136
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,920
- Okay.

137
00:06:23,923 --> 00:06:25,143
- Let's just give them
some time to settle.

138
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:27,062
- That's fine.

139
00:06:27,064 --> 00:06:29,594
(upbeat music)

140
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:31,055
- Still playing with your gun?

141
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:32,402
- Well, Time to go hunting.

142
00:06:32,404 --> 00:06:33,274
- I know, got to get my

143
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:36,238
make sure my gun works
before we go hunting, right?

144
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:37,071
- Well, what you,

145
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:37,992
what you putting on it?

146
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:39,101
- Well, this is a dusty place.

147
00:06:39,102 --> 00:06:39,947
I need to clean it.

148
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:40,886
This is Mil-Comm.

149
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:42,275
And this is a specific cleaner,

150
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,537
enzyme-based cleaner.

151
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:46,755
- So before you actually lube, or put

152
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:48,013
grease or anything like that on your

153
00:06:48,014 --> 00:06:49,921
weapon, you need to clean it.

154
00:06:49,922 --> 00:06:52,677
- And it doesn't stick to anything,

155
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:54,066
and cleans up nice?

156
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,107
- No, it cleans it good,

157
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:56,298
and then preps it,

158
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
preps it for the oil.

159
00:06:57,302 --> 00:06:59,312
And you got two, you got a grease,

160
00:06:59,314 --> 00:07:02,662
and the grease works really
good on the bolt lugs.

161
00:07:02,663 --> 00:07:04,688
Because when you grease the bolt lugs in a

162
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,766
bolt rifle, you don't want oil that just

163
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,543
runs out all into the magazine and

164
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:09,484
everywhere else.

165
00:07:09,485 --> 00:07:11,738
So you apply the grease
just on the bolt lugs.

166
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,238
- I was gonna ask you why you need grease

167
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:14,076
if you have oil.

168
00:07:14,084 --> 00:07:17,143
- Well, and it's all non-toxic.

169
00:07:17,144 --> 00:07:17,984
So you just,

170
00:07:17,985 --> 00:07:19,657
- And you need a pocket knife.

171
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:21,679
- Oh yeah, I need to get that cut.

172
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,450
So it's all non-toxic, and you just

173
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:26,558
put a little dab behind each bolt lug.

174
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:27,872
Because this is really the only place

175
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:30,865
on a bolt rifle where it's critical.

176
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,299
And you lock it in, you've got

177
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,648
a little bit of lubrication there.

178
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:38,495
- Okay.

179
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:39,355
- And not so much where the,

180
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:40,561
because this is a really
dusty environment.

181
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:41,405
- It is.

182
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,257
- Attracts a lot of stuff.

183
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:44,945
You've got the oil,
which is the same stuff,

184
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:46,451
just much thinner.

185
00:07:47,471 --> 00:07:49,170
You put this on all the outer surfaces,

186
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:51,330
but you also clean your bore with it.

187
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:52,538
When you clean your bore,

188
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:55,578
the more you shoot, it provides a barrier

189
00:07:55,579 --> 00:07:57,829
that also allows it, when you're,

190
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,169
the fouling from the copper.

191
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,000
- Yeah?

192
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:00,841
- You know the copper jackets

193
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:01,666
and the gilding metal.

194
00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:02,948
That barrier it provides in the bore

195
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,349
makes that material, that
copper and that gilding

196
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,257
metal, easier to remove.

197
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:08,654
When you're cleaning the bolt.
- Okay, so you shoot, and you

198
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,871
use it every time you clean it

199
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:12,314
it's like your last --
- And the more you use it,

200
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:14,333
the more it impregnates
itself into the metal,

201
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:17,236
and then, it makes it
easier to clean your bore.

202
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,087
- That's pretty cool.

203
00:08:18,092 --> 00:08:19,552
- A lot of military units are using it.

204
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:21,592
It's good stuff.

205
00:08:21,593 --> 00:08:23,885
You got a cleaner, you got oil,

206
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:25,736
and you got a grease.

207
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:28,305
So I'm almost ready to go hunting.

208
00:08:28,306 --> 00:08:29,896
- Well pack it up, let's go.

209
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:32,494
(upbeat music)

210
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,518
- The cool thing about Africa is that it's

211
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:44,909
a myriad of emotions when
you get there, but if

212
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,648
I had to take those emotions and somehow

213
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:50,247
transpose them into a phrase that someone

214
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:52,051
could understand, or even a word that

215
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:55,007
someone could understand,
it's the unknown.

216
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:58,424
(music continues)

217
00:08:58,425 --> 00:09:00,325
When you step off a
plane, and you put your

218
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,049
boot print into that
red dirt for the first

219
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,597
time, everything is different. The tracks

220
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:07,048
on the ground are different
from home, the people

221
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,437
are different from home.
The trees, the air smells

222
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:11,430
different, the sunsets look different.

223
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,371
Everything is so different
that it makes me feel

224
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:16,040
like I'm hunting on another planet.

225
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:18,547
And I know how cliche that is, but until

226
00:09:18,553 --> 00:09:20,293
you actually feel that
for yourself, to feel

227
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:23,129
so displaced from what
you're comfortable with.

228
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,426
That weird feeling that
keeps me going back.

229
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:28,924
Something that's just
so totally different.

230
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:29,805
- We can do it.

231
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:31,057
- We can do it.

232
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:33,609
- For whatever reason,
I took to hunting very

233
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,154
very early. My dad didn't hunt,

234
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:38,544
but he and my mom did
bring me up on a farm.

235
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,585
So I had that outdoor lifestyle, right?

236
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:43,409
I had an appreciation for animals,

237
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:44,934
pulling stuff from the
ground, and turning that

238
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:47,668
from the barn, from the
ground, the garden, into food.

239
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,509
And I think that was just
a natural progression

240
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,815
for me to take that to hunting.

241
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:53,667
My horizons continued to broaden.

242
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:55,705
And one state turned into two states,

243
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:57,006
turned into three states, turned

244
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,044
into different countries.

245
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:59,617
Turned into Africa.

246
00:10:05,284 --> 00:10:07,253
So what's, you saw one
bull walking, and you think

247
00:10:07,254 --> 00:10:08,102
he's a good one?

248
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:09,072
Can't tell?

249
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:10,638
The one that was under the tree.

250
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,436
- [Thys] That's the one that, he just got

251
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:13,941
up and slowly walked off.

252
00:10:13,942 --> 00:10:15,767
- Oh, that's not cool.

253
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,834
- The distance is 1,229 yards.

254
00:10:28,472 --> 00:10:29,600
- Negative, not even.
- It's gonna be, it's

255
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:30,426
gonna be difficult.

256
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,137
- Not even the 300 mag
- You don't think the Mossberg

257
00:10:32,138 --> 00:10:33,158
can get it done?
- Is gonna do that.

258
00:10:33,161 --> 00:10:34,301
Oh I think it'd get it done, I don't think

259
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:35,489
I can get it done.

260
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:36,339
(laughs)

261
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,748
- As the editor in chief of Gun Digest,

262
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:39,978
the short version would be
that I take all content,

263
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:42,768
whether that's for print,
digital, a little bit

264
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:45,125
for TV across all of our
mediums, and figure out

265
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:46,786
how that works together,
so we can get our gun

266
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:48,650
content out to the masses, right?

267
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:51,177
That would be the short
description of really what

268
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:52,910
I do day in and day out.

269
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:54,379
Most of that's done from the front room,

270
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,686
from the front office of the house.

271
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:57,657
But, if there were a long description,

272
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,899
what I love most about
it, it was figuring out

273
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:01,683
how to take a lifelong passion of shooting

274
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:03,792
and hunting, and turn that into a career.

275
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:04,881
Well, here's how I feel about it,

276
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,291
I'm not just gonna throw lead and hope

277
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:07,602
to get one in, because these guys

278
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:09,501
can track so well. I
mean that's, obviously,

279
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,542
that's why we practice. Only problem

280
00:11:11,543 --> 00:11:12,972
with killing critters, the goal is to

281
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,541
kill it as quickly as possible, obviously.

282
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:15,386
- Take it out.

283
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:17,579
- So with this rifle, I'd take this rifle

284
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,223
anywhere in the world.
Especially chambered,

285
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:21,365
and 300 Win Mag. But with this wind,

286
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:23,885
and just the emotions
that happen when you're

287
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:25,366
hunting like that. Especially with a kudu.

288
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:26,757
I don't know what it is
about a kudu, it's just

289
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:27,711
the elusiveness.
- Everyone has a right gun

290
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:29,236
to chamber.
- Yeah.

291
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:31,887
You've heard the phrase
figure out what you want to

292
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:33,809
do with your life, turn
that into a career,

293
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,018
and you never work a day in your life.

294
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,837
I don't know if that's
true. There are plenty

295
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,179
of days that I get under
the boss' skin, and we

296
00:11:39,183 --> 00:11:41,071
have at it a little bit,
that make it feel like work.

297
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:42,827
But on the flip side
of that, there sure are

298
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:44,424
plenty of days where I
get to do some really

299
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:47,068
cool stuff, get to see
some really cool new guns,

300
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:49,904
new ammo, new gear, you name it.

301
00:11:49,905 --> 00:11:51,115
So look, on the copies
like this, especially

302
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,520
with the BDX system, where I can get down,

303
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:55,828
and get steady on a
rock. 500 yards, I'd feel

304
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,405
comfortable, if he was standing.

305
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:59,006
And the wind, you know,
was either straight on,

306
00:11:59,008 --> 00:12:00,638
you know, it wasn't belly, but.

307
00:12:00,642 --> 00:12:01,482
- Yeah, not like today.

308
00:12:01,483 --> 00:12:04,645
- No, but off the sticks,
either standing or sitting,

309
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:06,765
no more kneeling, I'm done
kneeling through yesterday.

310
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:09,165
I think, you know, 300.
And then off end, get

311
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,815
them within 100, you know.

312
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:12,576
Those are the goals I'd
like to set for myself

313
00:12:12,582 --> 00:12:15,541
as far as feeling confident
about the shot I could make.

314
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,900
And again, that's not the setup, it's me.

315
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:20,519
It's totally me, and my ability to get

316
00:12:20,522 --> 00:12:21,732
what needs to be done.
- No, I mean,

317
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:24,230
that setup is perfect.
- Yeah.

318
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:27,501
- Hey Richard,

319
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:30,364
remember when I told you about this tree?

320
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:31,295
You remember what it's named?

321
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:32,459
- Shepherd's tree.

322
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,985
- Correct, the boscia albitrunca.

323
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,859
And there's two cool facts about it.

324
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,437
So, way back when,
these trees are ancient.

325
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:44,915
They grow extremely slowly. And there was

326
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:48,497
hardly any trees here. I mean,
if you look at the Boer War

327
00:12:48,503 --> 00:12:50,544
photos of 100 years ago, they were

328
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:51,375
- It was all grass.

329
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:53,198
- It was all grass, it
was hardly any trees.

330
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:54,729
So it's called the
shepherd's tree, because

331
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:57,121
herd boys would be, these were the only

332
00:12:57,124 --> 00:12:58,523
trees around for shade.

333
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:01,111
The second cool fact is coffee was a rare

334
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:03,885
substance back then in Southern Africa.

335
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:05,762
And they used to, the
old folks used to take

336
00:13:05,763 --> 00:13:08,718
the roots and make a
coffee substance from it.

337
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:09,549
- Oh.

338
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:11,147
- Interesting fact about that, though,

339
00:13:11,148 --> 00:13:12,608
you couldn't have too much, because it's

340
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:13,462
a natural laxative.

341
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:14,956
(laughs)

342
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:16,567
- Well, you know what I say about coffee.

343
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,420
- Yeah.

344
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,712
- Same thing your dad said.

345
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:19,651
If you drink that stuff, it's

346
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:20,498
your own fault.
- Your own fault.

347
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,580
(laughs)

348
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:28,978
- You can slowly put one in the chamber.

349
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,807
(gun clicks)

350
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:43,605
- Bullet inside?

351
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:44,438
- Yes.

352
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,310
(suspenseful music)

353
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:21,777
- There they are.

354
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,609
- Oh yeah, I see them.

355
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:34,634
- Look on the far right.

356
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:38,901
The big man is in front.

357
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:39,822
- Oh, yeah.

358
00:14:41,843 --> 00:14:44,473
That's the one I want, huh?

359
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:46,715
He's looking our way, huh?

360
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:47,916
- No they're just looking around,

361
00:14:47,924 --> 00:14:50,494
but they're relaxed, they're
starting to feed again.

362
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:51,646
- Okay.

363
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,807
- And that's what we want.

364
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:58,662
(music continues)

365
00:15:15,446 --> 00:15:17,226
- They are quite spread out here, Alfredo.

366
00:15:17,228 --> 00:15:18,058
- Okay.

367
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,081
- Just want to make sure
there's no eyes watching

368
00:15:21,082 --> 00:15:21,920
us going in.

369
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,745
- Okay.

370
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:26,432
- They are still moving.

371
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:29,684
They are about 400 yards at the moment.

372
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:33,572
(music continues)

373
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:47,077
- I see the one that

374
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:48,008
- With his head down?

375
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:48,872
- Yeah.

376
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:50,315
- He's moving left.

377
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,234
- Under the tree?

378
00:15:51,235 --> 00:15:52,519
- Yeah, a little left, right?

379
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,440
- Big male.

380
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:01,302
(whispering)

381
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:03,923
- It's just the rams, they
are chasing each other.

382
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:07,422
- Hopefully they'll chase them towards us.

383
00:16:09,794 --> 00:16:11,783
- They're still coming back this way.

384
00:16:11,784 --> 00:16:12,784
That's good.

385
00:16:17,714 --> 00:16:19,872
Alfredo, we might be in luck.

386
00:16:19,873 --> 00:16:21,044
- Good.

387
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:23,295
- They've changed their
direction of feeding.

388
00:16:23,298 --> 00:16:24,426
- They're coming towards us.

389
00:16:24,427 --> 00:16:25,367
- They're coming straight towards us.

390
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:26,694
- Awesome.

391
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,075
- I need to get you set up.

392
00:16:29,077 --> 00:16:31,657
(upbeat music)

393
00:16:37,713 --> 00:16:39,411
- You bring me back a
milkshake from Kimberly?

394
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:40,262
- Absolutely.

395
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:41,879
Strawberry pineapple.

396
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,798
- Gross.

397
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,647
- How are you?

398
00:16:43,648 --> 00:16:44,498
How'd the morning go?
- Good.

399
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,249
Good good, got on a big kudu bull,

400
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,880
but it was quicker than I was.

401
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:48,732
- Yeah?

402
00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:49,800
- Close, but no cigar.

403
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:50,751
- Check this out.

404
00:16:50,753 --> 00:16:51,603
- Man, that's a critter.

405
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:52,462
- Yeah.

406
00:16:52,463 --> 00:16:53,296
- Look at that.

407
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,644
Been busy today.

408
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:57,659
- It's not a Harley Davidson, but it's

409
00:16:57,663 --> 00:16:58,501
a blesbok.
- Yeah.

410
00:16:58,502 --> 00:17:00,146
- It's a very nice buck.
- Yeah, it's no warthog, but.

411
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,700
- Well, this is perfect.
Because I've been itching

412
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:02,629
all week to see what you do with the meat.

413
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,086
Everything else we've shot is coming

414
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,371
either late at night, or I've been

415
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:07,076
out still trying to catch my kudu.

416
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,256
So let's turn this body
into meat, shall we?

417
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:11,107
- Let's do it.

418
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:13,685
(upbeat music)

419
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:23,466
- Everybody has a stigma
of trophy hunting,

420
00:17:23,467 --> 00:17:25,487
and we just lob the head
off, and take the hide.

421
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:26,342
- Yeah.

422
00:17:26,343 --> 00:17:28,379
- The meat, and you know, yes, you shoot

423
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,028
an animal, and you take an animal's life.

424
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:33,402
For the horns and the hides the memory,

425
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:35,419
but the meat is for the body.

426
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,900
And when I say the meat's for the body,

427
00:17:36,901 --> 00:17:38,634
it's just to sustain our bodies.

428
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:39,765
- That's a great way to sum it up.

429
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:41,402
Because it's hard to explain sometimes.

430
00:17:41,404 --> 00:17:44,581
- It is. And to address the meat thing,

431
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:48,507
I mean, all we do is,
you know, a large percent

432
00:17:48,508 --> 00:17:53,398
of it my family use, our
trackers, the community.

433
00:17:53,404 --> 00:17:56,498
So we take a back strap, or a leg for

434
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:58,129
personal consumption, and a lot of it goes

435
00:17:58,132 --> 00:18:00,545
to them, back to the community.

436
00:18:00,546 --> 00:18:02,126
There's even a butcher in Kimberly that

437
00:18:02,134 --> 00:18:04,921
buys meat from us from time to time.

438
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:07,592
And then a large part of
my business is hunting

439
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:10,260
with local South Africans for meat.

440
00:18:10,263 --> 00:18:12,372
The same way you guys would hunt deer,

441
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:15,690
we hunt, you know, kudu
and blesbok and springbok

442
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:18,009
for meat as well. My mom has a sausage

443
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:21,620
business that we use
warthogs, because we have

444
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,784
so many warthogs, we try
and keep the population

445
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:24,615
in check.

446
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:25,668
- You even eat the warthogs?

447
00:18:25,674 --> 00:18:26,702
- We even eat the warthogs.

448
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:27,555
- Those ugly ass critters.

449
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:28,818
- Yes.

450
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:30,879
- So, like, the warthog that
you took earlier this week.

451
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,739
- Yeah.

452
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,669
- That will get turned
into sausage, and we

453
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,787
make it as cheap as
possible for the community,

454
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:37,388
because meat is expensive.

455
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:41,718
So what we don't provide
them, it's difficult

456
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:44,559
for them to go to a supermarket
and buy quality meat.

457
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,217
So we give it to them
at, like, cost price.

458
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:50,948
When we make our sausage,
all we're covering

459
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:52,980
is, you know, the casings
and the spices and stuff.

460
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:53,839
- Yeah.

461
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,389
- But it's to try and
help the community out.

462
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,940
- And what I find interesting
is that everything

463
00:18:57,943 --> 00:19:00,286
you're telling me, it's
not an obligation, right?

464
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:01,137
This stuff is good.

465
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:02,888
- It is, it is,
- I mean.

466
00:19:02,889 --> 00:19:03,769
- It's fantastic.

467
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:05,371
- The kudu is obviously amazing.

468
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:07,797
I think blesbok is, or
excuse me, the gemsbok

469
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:08,768
has actually been my favorite.

470
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:09,618
- It has.

471
00:19:09,621 --> 00:19:10,469
- That we had two nights ago.

472
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,318
- That was amazing.

473
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:12,191
- It's really good.

474
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,765
- And, you know, like
that gemsbok, that was

475
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:17,077
from an earlier hunt,
and we just took a leg,

476
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:19,702
and my wife did the
whole marinade, and the

477
00:19:19,703 --> 00:19:21,858
normal process she goes through

478
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:24,447
And I mean, we did, deboned
it and barbecued it,

479
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:25,545
and it was delicious.

480
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,148
- I'd take that over a
whitetail any day of the week.

481
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:27,997
(laughs)

482
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:29,017
I promise you.
- I've had good whitetail,

483
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,155
though.
- I've had good whitetail,

484
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:31,256
too. I like that better.

485
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:33,552
- I really enjoyed your elk.

486
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:36,035
- We all do. Can't beat good elk.

487
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:37,786
- I've, you know, visiting
clients in the state,

488
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,300
I really enjoyed your elk.

489
00:19:40,301 --> 00:19:41,151
- That's cool, that's good.

490
00:19:41,152 --> 00:19:44,229
So these guys are what we can in camp,

491
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,067
you can, you take what
you can for the family,

492
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:48,768
and then these guys take
it back to their families,

493
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:51,176
and whatever's left, the
sausage or the community.

494
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:53,712
- Exactly. And it's a whole
full circle, I mean, the

495
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:57,199
salt that we use to salt
the skins and the skulls

496
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,970
comes from our local salt
lake community. I took Joe

497
00:20:00,973 --> 00:20:04,561
and showed him two days
ago, went down there

498
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:05,802
and I showed him.

499
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,524
So everything here, we, you know?

500
00:20:07,525 --> 00:20:09,938
Full circle in our community.

501
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:13,028
- Fort Richmond Safari really provided

502
00:20:13,034 --> 00:20:15,110
us with a unique experience.

503
00:20:15,111 --> 00:20:18,218
I've hunted quite a few
different places over

504
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,789
the years, and this
one I had to rate right

505
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,064
up there at the top. The scenic

506
00:20:23,065 --> 00:20:25,444
camp that they had out there in a remote

507
00:20:25,445 --> 00:20:28,775
location was just extraordinary.

508
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:32,344
And I've been on maybe
20, 30 wall tent type

509
00:20:32,345 --> 00:20:34,735
camps in the US that I've hosted.

510
00:20:34,743 --> 00:20:36,881
So I know the kind of work that goes

511
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:38,124
into those kind of things.

512
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,615
But to have all of those
kind of comforts at

513
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:43,260
home in that unique
setting, with the animals

514
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:46,441
just out our front yard,
was just an experience

515
00:20:46,442 --> 00:20:47,939
I'll never forget.

516
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,169
- I feel like we should
have a little bit of party,

517
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:56,081
because Alfredo and Mark are
not the last ones tonight.

518
00:20:56,082 --> 00:20:58,226
Congratulations, gentlemen.

519
00:20:58,231 --> 00:21:00,455
Not holding up supper any
more, appreciate that.

520
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:02,296
- No, but we're missing
a couple people here,

521
00:21:02,297 --> 00:21:03,835
where the hell are they?

522
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:04,821
- It's quieter without them, who cares.

523
00:21:04,822 --> 00:21:05,660
- Yeah, it is.

524
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:06,505
- Yeah.

525
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:07,815
- I get tired of Geoffrey's laugh.

526
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:10,418
(all laugh)

527
00:21:10,421 --> 00:21:12,491
- Nothing worse than a guy who's not funny

528
00:21:12,494 --> 00:21:13,452
who thinks he's funny.

529
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:14,300
- Yeah.

530
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:15,334
(laughs)

531
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:16,575
- But I wonder what's keeping them.

532
00:21:16,578 --> 00:21:17,438
- What are they doing, though?

533
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,311
- Yeah.

534
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:19,226
- Has anybody heard from them?

535
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,110
- Have not.

536
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,180
- Not a peep.

537
00:21:21,183 --> 00:21:23,633
- [Richard] That's probably not
good, then, they're probably

538
00:21:23,634 --> 00:21:24,718
up to something.

539
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:25,689
- I need a zebra report.

540
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:26,740
- Zebra day.

541
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:27,691
- Zebra day.

542
00:21:27,693 --> 00:21:28,551
- Zebra day.

543
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:29,406
Absolutely.

544
00:21:29,408 --> 00:21:30,348
- Everything work out?

545
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:32,975
- Absolutely bud, it was a great day.

546
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:33,829
- Congratulations.

547
00:21:33,831 --> 00:21:37,635
- We saw either 12 or
14, I counted them about.

548
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:39,006
- Yep, there were 12.

549
00:21:39,013 --> 00:21:40,362
- Yeah.

550
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:41,863
- In a herd down in the valley.

551
00:21:41,864 --> 00:21:45,107
We were, snuck up on a nice rocky point

552
00:21:46,685 --> 00:21:48,895
on the cookie and sat there for at least

553
00:21:48,903 --> 00:21:51,590
45 minutes. Watching them, letting it sort

554
00:21:51,591 --> 00:21:54,086
out the big stallion
was laying down behind

555
00:21:54,087 --> 00:21:56,785
the acacia tree with a
bunch of other zebras

556
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:59,799
around. Some laying down, some getting up.

557
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:03,281
And when I got up there, I said which one?

558
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:05,526
And Leon said no, let's
sit and watch them for

559
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:06,377
a while.

560
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:07,227
- He wanted it now.

561
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:08,505
- Oh, they didn't know anything about you.

562
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:09,385
- He wanted him now.

563
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:10,848
- Perfect.

564
00:22:10,849 --> 00:22:11,837
- Yeah, at that point, not really

565
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:13,028
caring at all if you get a shot or not.

566
00:22:13,033 --> 00:22:14,382
At that point, it doesn't really matter.

567
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:15,742
- I wouldn't go that far.

568
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:18,311
- Yeah, I bet, you bloodthirsty old man.

569
00:22:18,312 --> 00:22:20,889
- It worked out, because I mean, because

570
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:22,443
we had plenty of time
to range them, you know,

571
00:22:22,444 --> 00:22:25,188
297 yards, you know, with the BDX.

572
00:22:25,192 --> 00:22:28,062
So I knew that going in for a long time.

573
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,385
- Well done.

574
00:22:29,386 --> 00:22:31,556
- It was almost one of those times where

575
00:22:31,562 --> 00:22:33,842
you're there watching them too long. First

576
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:35,341
I thought it was good,
because then I could

577
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:36,175
calm down, and

578
00:22:36,184 --> 00:22:37,042
- Yeah.

579
00:22:37,043 --> 00:22:38,257
- But then it's like now,
I'm starting to overthink

580
00:22:38,263 --> 00:22:39,925
this, you know?

581
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:42,735
And then, when I finally
did put the rifle up,

582
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,106
the four stallions were moving around with

583
00:22:44,107 --> 00:22:47,407
each other, and I safety off, and then one

584
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:50,810
would walk in the way, and say safety

585
00:22:50,811 --> 00:22:51,641
back on.

586
00:22:51,644 --> 00:22:52,504
- Ice the kicker.

587
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,519
- And it just, you know, yeah, exactly.

588
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,394
That happened six times,
at least, probably.

589
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:00,275
But then, finally, one cleared,

590
00:23:00,282 --> 00:23:04,089
and put the little BDX dot
on him, and whacked him.

591
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:04,940
- Whack.

592
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:05,803
- Yep.

593
00:23:05,804 --> 00:23:07,235
And he was a big,

594
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:11,286
big massive stallion.
- That's awesome.

595
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:12,209
- That's great.

596
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,178
- Yeah, and it was cool.

597
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:15,657
- Yeah, they don't really
look that big on the hoof.

598
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:17,795
But when you get up close to them, they're

599
00:23:17,802 --> 00:23:19,450
much bigger than you expect.

600
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:22,088
- And you're really
grateful when the staff

601
00:23:22,089 --> 00:23:23,357
shows up to carry him out.

602
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,209
(laughs)

603
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,058
Because you had no idea.

604
00:23:25,061 --> 00:23:25,911
- Of course.

605
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:28,338
- How we're gonna get
this 500 pound animal.

606
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:29,719
- They're of course, going down,

607
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,686
Joe didn't like all the waiting,

608
00:23:31,688 --> 00:23:33,318
and he pushed me down.
- Oh he pushed,

609
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,188
he pushed you down.

610
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:35,189
- [Richard] Classy.

611
00:23:35,193 --> 00:23:36,623
I was gonna ask if that was a tattoo.

612
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:38,506
- No, no, sir.

613
00:23:38,507 --> 00:23:39,627
(all chatting, laughing)

614
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:40,781
- It looks like a dragonfly from here.

615
00:23:40,782 --> 00:23:43,277
- I bled like wounded animal.
- Like a gunshot.

616
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:44,436
(all laugh)

617
00:23:44,437 --> 00:23:46,407
- [Mark] Gunshot wound.

618
00:23:46,412 --> 00:23:47,712
- Yeah, I was trying to slow him down.

619
00:23:47,713 --> 00:23:49,796
He climbs those mountains
so fast, and just

620
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:50,627
goes, goes, goes.

621
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:52,290
- Did you get a new tattoo
that I don't know about?

622
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:53,233
- No.

623
00:23:53,234 --> 00:23:55,057
- Where have you been?

624
00:23:56,221 --> 00:23:58,331
- Well, we've been looking for a Harley.

625
00:23:58,332 --> 00:24:00,155
(laughs)

626
00:24:00,156 --> 00:24:00,986
- A Harley?

627
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:01,819
- A Harley what?

628
00:24:01,822 --> 00:24:04,211
- A Harley Davidson.

629
00:24:04,212 --> 00:24:06,169
A big ol' tusker.

630
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,640
- Oh, and, any luck?

631
00:24:08,641 --> 00:24:10,081
- No.

632
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:11,601
- Saw a lot of pigs today.
- Yeah.

633
00:24:11,602 --> 00:24:13,667
- Saw some nice ones,
but, I mean Richard's shot

634
00:24:13,671 --> 00:24:15,369
so many pigs, I said, you know, that's

635
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,250
- We're looking for the

636
00:24:16,254 --> 00:24:17,622
- Oh, he's becoming selective, now.

637
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:18,465
- Muy pigs.

638
00:24:18,466 --> 00:24:19,325
- A shovelhead?

639
00:24:19,331 --> 00:24:21,301
- Exactly.
- Shovelhead, yeah.

640
00:24:21,304 --> 00:24:24,212
- [Mark] No, he uh, you
know, he's shot so many pigs

641
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,570
these days, in the last
few years. So I'm like

642
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:30,419
no, you need to get yourself
a proper one, you know?

643
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,250
A stuff.

644
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:32,263
- [Luke] Like we did.

645
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,516
- Like you did.

646
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:34,767
- Did all right, didn't we?
- Yeah.

647
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:35,761
- You did.

648
00:24:35,762 --> 00:24:36,647
- [Richard] Like your pig.

649
00:24:36,648 --> 00:24:38,545
- [Luke] Yeah. Saw lots
of pigs today, but just

650
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:39,499
didn't see the right one.

651
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,348
- [Mark] Right.

652
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:41,829
- [Richard] What did,
uh, what did y'all do?

653
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,376
Anything?

654
00:24:43,377 --> 00:24:45,647
- Got a story right there,
(all chatting)

655
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:46,739
a tattoo.

656
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,728
- What happened to your leg?

657
00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:49,459
- What I heard walking up
- Were you not a doctor

658
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:50,924
was like someone got a tattoo.

659
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:51,765
(laughs)

660
00:24:51,773 --> 00:24:52,653
- Richard, I almost bled to
- I can see.

661
00:24:52,654 --> 00:24:55,227
- death, okay. So whatever you do,

662
00:24:55,231 --> 00:24:57,061
never ever offend Joe.

663
00:24:59,018 --> 00:24:59,848
(all chatting)
- He pushed me

664
00:24:59,851 --> 00:25:01,127
down a mountain!

665
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:02,348
- Don't turn your back.

666
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:03,422
- Probably hit him with his cane.

667
00:25:03,423 --> 00:25:05,955
(all laugh)

668
00:25:05,956 --> 00:25:07,976
- Leon, it's a good thing you're a doctor,

669
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:09,847
you can take care of your own injury.

670
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:11,888
Yeah, I joke, we had a
good fall this morning,

671
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:13,569
but it also doesn't
help if you get pushed.

672
00:25:13,571 --> 00:25:14,761
- I didn't think you felt that.

673
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,603
- Oh my.

674
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:18,921
That's why it always
helps to be prepared, Joe.

675
00:25:18,924 --> 00:25:19,772
- Oh.

676
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,342
- Otherwise, I might
have just bled to death.

677
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:22,985
- So, you are actually a doctor.

678
00:25:22,986 --> 00:25:24,685
Gotta come prepared.

679
00:25:24,686 --> 00:25:27,046
Well, honestly it was
kind of a nasty fall.

680
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:28,725
But it's rocky terrain up there.

681
00:25:28,726 --> 00:25:30,106
- Yeah, it's very rocky terrain, Joe.

682
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,041
One always needs to be
very careful on the hills,

683
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:33,785
and remember we had
the chat the first day.

684
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,620
(laughs)

685
00:25:34,623 --> 00:25:35,463
What is the first rule, Joe?

686
00:25:35,464 --> 00:25:36,924
That only you are allowed to fall.

687
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:37,785
That's it.

688
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,616
(laughs)

689
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:39,739
If you're gonna fall, Joe,
which way are you gonna fall?

690
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,227
Well, you don't grab anything.

691
00:25:41,234 --> 00:25:42,543
- Yes, and the third rule?

692
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:43,414
- I don't remember.

693
00:25:43,415 --> 00:25:44,515
- You always fall uphill.

694
00:25:44,516 --> 00:25:45,936
- Oh, I wasn't listening to that part.

695
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:46,784
- Oh.

696
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:47,804
(both laugh)

697
00:25:47,805 --> 00:25:48,745
Good thing you didn't fall, then!

698
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:50,085
- Yeah. Absolutely.

699
00:25:50,086 --> 00:25:51,886
But I'm glad you went
first, and stepped on that

700
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,659
rock that rolled out from under you,

701
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,627
so I didn't.
- Yeah, I'm sure you

702
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,299
enjoyed the spectacular fall.

703
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,408
- Well, I knew to go around it, though.

704
00:25:58,409 --> 00:25:59,258
- Very gracious.

705
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:02,964
- Yeah, exactly. So I got down safely.

706
00:26:02,965 --> 00:26:03,795
- Just don't, don't turn your back, that's

707
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:04,908
all I got to say.

708
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,437
(all laugh)

709
00:26:06,438 --> 00:26:09,468
- Did you not, like, have a band-aid?

710
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,300
You're a doctor.

711
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:11,663
- You're the doctor, exactly.

712
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:13,334
- I'm still here. Does
it look as if I've bled

713
00:26:13,335 --> 00:26:14,478
death, no I didn't.

714
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:16,760
- I offered to stitch it up.

715
00:26:16,761 --> 00:26:19,519
- [Luke] I would have
paid money to see that.

716
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,007
He said I will stitch
it up, but I don't have

717
00:26:22,009 --> 00:26:24,864
anything to numb the pain.

718
00:26:24,865 --> 00:26:26,665
- And I kinda, I think
that killed the deal.

719
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:27,939
- Nope, skipped it.

720
00:26:27,943 --> 00:26:29,613
- What was the deal?

721
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:33,289
Why were you on the, what happened?

722
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,500
- We were starting down
the mountain, to go

723
00:26:35,501 --> 00:26:38,304
and recover the zebra,
and it was extremely,

724
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,135
extremely rocky.

725
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:40,848
- Wait a minute, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

726
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,431
- Zebra.

727
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,402
- Recover the zebra.

728
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:44,852
- I didn't hear anything
on the radio about a zebra.

729
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,063
- Zebra, zebra day.

730
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,103
- So you got, you got the mountain zebra?

731
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:50,022
- I got the mountain zebra.

732
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:50,942
- Oh, well done.
- Congratulations.

733
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:53,170
- Thank you, thank you very much.

734
00:26:53,173 --> 00:26:54,366
Cheers indeed.

735
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:58,426
Beautiful, beautiful, big-rumped animal.

736
00:26:58,427 --> 00:26:59,516
A rug and a steak.

737
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,357
- Mhm.

738
00:27:00,364 --> 00:27:01,224
- As they say.

739
00:27:01,225 --> 00:27:02,896
- Yeah, absolutely, this is just

740
00:27:02,897 --> 00:27:03,985
- That meat is amazing.

741
00:27:03,987 --> 00:27:04,917
- Yeah.

742
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,770
- It's sweet.

743
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:08,142
- It's delicious.

744
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:11,715
- They are my and I know,
definitely Taylor's favorite.

745
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:12,546
- I don't know about you, Mark.

746
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,809
- And Mark told me last week, when we were

747
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:17,341
hunting together, mountain zebra is even

748
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:18,912
better than the plains.

749
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:20,873
- It is, because they don't
- I haven't tasted it before,

750
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:22,247
but he said it's much better.

751
00:27:22,252 --> 00:27:23,741
- [Richard] Huh, I didn't know that.

752
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,722
- Because the plains zebra has that yellow

753
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:28,392
fat, where it's that weird smell.

754
00:27:28,393 --> 00:27:29,233
- Yeah.

755
00:27:29,234 --> 00:27:31,646
- And it's very good, as
long as you cut it away,

756
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:33,312
but mountain zebra don't have it.

757
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:34,941
- So are you saying that
because it's leaner,

758
00:27:34,942 --> 00:27:35,912
it tastes better?

759
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:39,088
- No, no, it's not leaner, it's just that

760
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:42,836
the Burchell, the plains
zebra has yellow fat,

761
00:27:42,837 --> 00:27:46,616
which is, I think you
guys call it like talon,

762
00:27:46,617 --> 00:27:47,447
or something like that.

763
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,306
- Tallow.
- Tallow,

764
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:52,467
and it gives that funny
taste. But if you cut it

765
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:53,791
off the meat, it's fine. You know?

766
00:27:53,792 --> 00:27:55,762
You skin it, and within a
day cut it off, it's fine.

767
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:58,355
- So, the mountain zebra's not as sweet?

768
00:27:58,364 --> 00:28:00,201
- No, it's not less sweet, it just doesn't

769
00:28:00,202 --> 00:28:02,217
have that fat that if
you hang it for a week,

770
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:03,428
taints the meat.

771
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,472
- Oh, I got you.
- No, it's white,

772
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,834
white color.
- It's easier to process.

773
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:10,239
- So, congratulations on the zebra.

774
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,930
Did you do anything today?

775
00:28:11,932 --> 00:28:14,422
- I am gonna be in such
great shape when I get home,

776
00:28:14,424 --> 00:28:15,584
the wife is gonna be happy.

777
00:28:15,585 --> 00:28:18,316
(all laugh)

778
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:20,214
- Did mountain goat take you on a walk?

779
00:28:20,215 --> 00:28:21,539
- He did.

780
00:28:21,542 --> 00:28:22,382
Kudu mountain?

781
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:23,975
- Kudu mountain.
- Kudu mountain.

782
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:26,344
- Yep, we started up there,
saw a, what's your word?

783
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:28,260
Ripper, ripper, ripper?

784
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:31,296
- The stuof.
- The stuof.

785
00:28:31,303 --> 00:28:32,703
- Yeah, what he said.

786
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:34,659
(laughs)

787
00:28:34,663 --> 00:28:36,272
No, we saw a good one, and he was,

788
00:28:36,273 --> 00:28:37,920
you ranged him, it was like 1100 yards.

789
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:39,418
Stupid distance out there.
- Yeah.

790
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,297
We were playing around
with a bit of action.

791
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:42,955
- Yeah, there was
- No, he's at 1200,

792
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,309
will it go there?

793
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:46,091
- He was, he was bedded,
we saw a cow walking

794
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,522
off, and he was bedded,
but he was silhouetted

795
00:28:48,524 --> 00:28:51,359
against the grass. And just, like, at 1100

796
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,590
yards, and you go dude.

797
00:28:53,592 --> 00:28:54,930
- So, you need to go
- If you see horns at

798
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:55,768
at that distance.

799
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:57,488
- Yeah, no kidding.
- And plenty of it.

800
00:28:57,492 --> 00:29:01,466
And so we got down, and
we were probably within,

801
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:03,177
at least 200 yards, I would say.

802
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,979
I mean, working our way, and Izzy found,

803
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,430
still amazes me how these guys track.

804
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,031
We walked 900 yards to the
tree where he was bedded,

805
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:11,459
just straight to it.

806
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,480
- I told him, you see,
he was just lying down

807
00:29:13,482 --> 00:29:15,678
here, pick up the track.
- No, he was like

808
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:16,779
that tree looks like that tree.

809
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,956
(all laugh)

810
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:20,103
But the tracks were under the tree.

811
00:29:20,104 --> 00:29:21,803
And so we followed them for probably,

812
00:29:21,804 --> 00:29:24,467
a couple hundred yards, and I thought we

813
00:29:24,468 --> 00:29:26,007
were doing a pretty darn
good job, but the wind

814
00:29:26,008 --> 00:29:27,088
was certainly in our favor. There's no

815
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:28,951
way they winded us. But all of a sudden,

816
00:29:28,952 --> 00:29:30,712
the four cows take off,
and then he was behind

817
00:29:30,713 --> 00:29:33,538
them, and of course,
I had a two and a half

818
00:29:33,544 --> 00:29:35,595
second shot, because my, um,

819
00:29:35,596 --> 00:29:38,234
and they didn't run to
like, say, what was that?

820
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,285
They were like, I want to see what's on

821
00:29:39,288 --> 00:29:40,828
the neighbor's property.

822
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:41,674
And they were gone.

823
00:29:41,675 --> 00:29:44,937
- Yeah, but then we
realized why they call it

824
00:29:44,941 --> 00:29:45,821
free range.

825
00:29:45,823 --> 00:29:47,144
(all laugh)

826
00:29:47,145 --> 00:29:50,305
He just hit that road, and kept going.

827
00:29:53,133 --> 00:29:55,532
- No, so that was, I would
call, like the highlight,

828
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:57,041
I suppose. But we were in good bulls all

829
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:57,871
I mean we saw bulls.

830
00:29:57,874 --> 00:29:59,122
- No, we saw a lot of things today.

831
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:00,086
- Throughout the day, sporadically.

832
00:30:00,087 --> 00:30:02,586
So, I mean it was far
from a disappointing day,

833
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,389
just every one of them seemed to just go,

834
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:06,510
just gone.
- Couldn't get it done.

835
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:08,237
- That's one thing that's difficult about

836
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:10,635
hunting any herd animal. Especially now,

837
00:30:10,637 --> 00:30:12,787
when you know we are
hunting kudu in the rut,

838
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:15,105
out of the rut bulls, kudu bulls

839
00:30:15,109 --> 00:30:16,504
form bachelor herds,

840
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:18,925
very similar to yak.
- Yep.

841
00:30:18,934 --> 00:30:20,684
- [Luke] And one difficult
thing about hunting

842
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:23,316
herd animals is you'll
be stalking this bull,

843
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:25,037
and you'll see a group of cows, and you'll

844
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:27,380
be careful. And then
there's some cows standing

845
00:30:27,381 --> 00:30:30,801
50 yards, or 100 yards that way, grazing.

846
00:30:31,685 --> 00:30:34,945
And you looking for
cover this way, but you

847
00:30:34,954 --> 00:30:36,370
don't see her, or notice her.

848
00:30:36,371 --> 00:30:38,955
And there's no cover there, and she alerts

849
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:40,551
everyone and goes.
- As Mark was saying

850
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:42,802
the other day when they were up there.

851
00:30:42,803 --> 00:30:44,421
There were baboons there. And today,

852
00:30:44,424 --> 00:30:46,026
we saw them.
- Oh, did you?

853
00:30:46,027 --> 00:30:47,667
- And he said
- And you didn't shoot them?

854
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:50,183
- Are you sure that the
baboons, they keep warning

855
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:51,441
the kudu down there.

856
00:30:51,444 --> 00:30:54,727
(all chatting, laughing)

857
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:55,927
- Kudu, kudu, kudu, come in.

858
00:30:55,928 --> 00:30:56,898
Yes, baboon?

859
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:59,197
(all chatting, laughing)

860
00:30:59,203 --> 00:31:01,166
There's two people walking towards you.

861
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,557
- Two hunters approaching from the west.

862
00:31:02,563 --> 00:31:03,582
- They do, they sit on the rocks,

863
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,052
and they're like, sneaking.

864
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:07,508
When they bark, they do this
hop. They're like there.

865
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:08,769
- You guys better move quick.
- Human!

866
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:10,231
There!

867
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:13,442
- [Mark] Move quick, they're in range!

868
00:31:13,444 --> 00:31:17,711
- They got BDX, be careful.
- Yeah, they do.

869
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:20,214
- [Luke] BDX is shit on one of those.

870
00:31:20,215 --> 00:31:21,515
- No, but all in all, a good day.

871
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,187
- No, it was really
good, it was really good.

872
00:31:23,188 --> 00:31:24,115
- We saw, I mean,

873
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:25,285
like I say, we saw baboons.
- So you killed

874
00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:26,709
nothing but time.

875
00:31:27,622 --> 00:31:28,690
- [Luke] I killed some serious calories,

876
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:29,521
I told you that.

877
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:31,349
(all laugh)

878
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,180
- Alfredo?

879
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,928
- I knew it was gonna be an ominous day.

880
00:31:34,929 --> 00:31:35,998
- How'd you know that?

881
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:37,827
- Because they took my tracker

882
00:31:37,828 --> 00:31:39,035
away from me, too.

883
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:42,536
I think Mark, myself, and
the tracker make a really

884
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:45,476
good team, and so we left without our

885
00:31:45,477 --> 00:31:48,175
tracker. I don't know who he was

886
00:31:48,176 --> 00:31:49,365
with, maybe you, Joe?

887
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,216
- [Luke] That was my fault.
They saw me shooting,

888
00:31:51,217 --> 00:31:53,267
they were like that
idiot needs two trackers.

889
00:31:53,268 --> 00:31:55,598
(all laugh)

890
00:31:56,522 --> 00:31:58,164
My bad, thank you.

891
00:31:58,165 --> 00:32:00,915
- So we're stocking some blesbok.

892
00:32:02,936 --> 00:32:04,406
We crawled, actually,

893
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:06,233
we crawled today, too.
- Absolutely.

894
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:09,055
- Crawled quite a bit to stay low.

895
00:32:09,942 --> 00:32:13,112
Found some, I was in a seated position

896
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:18,664
at about 170 yards, they started coming

897
00:32:18,665 --> 00:32:22,785
towards us. And I was
ready with my shooting

898
00:32:22,788 --> 00:32:26,115
sticks. But I couldn't see enough of their

899
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:30,646
body to be confident with
the placement of the shot.

900
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:34,188
So held off, they moved
on. We followed them,

901
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:39,019
and finally got to a spot where
one was presenting itself.

902
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:42,754
(intense music)

903
00:33:29,817 --> 00:33:31,917
- Okay, we're at about 290 now.

904
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:32,761
- Okay.

905
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:33,586
- 290.

906
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:34,419
- Okay.

907
00:33:49,847 --> 00:33:52,257
(whispering)

908
00:34:05,518 --> 00:34:07,348
- As flat as possible.

909
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:11,117
Sit down as flat as possible.
- Yeah.

910
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:13,201
- Slowly, slowly, slowly.

911
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,080
We've got lots of time, get comfortable.

912
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:36,365
We're gonna see if they
are gonna come closer.

913
00:34:36,368 --> 00:34:38,788
(whispering)

914
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:41,902
- I see two over here.

915
00:34:41,903 --> 00:34:42,843
- That's what we're gonna get,

916
00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:44,917
there's two males.
- Okay.

917
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:50,171
- We're gonna see if
they're gonna come closer.

918
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:05,391
Now, we play the waiting game.

919
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:18,365
- The grass is tall, and I can't really

920
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:21,766
see their leg, their front leg.

921
00:35:21,767 --> 00:35:22,597
- Yeah.

922
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,020
- To get my shot.

923
00:35:43,144 --> 00:35:46,144
- The second one from
the left is a big male.

924
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,599
- He's a big one.

925
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,117
- Big male, he's walking behind.

926
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:49,948
- Yeah.

927
00:35:53,497 --> 00:35:54,666
That's the big boy, right?

928
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:55,497
- They're chasing each other.

929
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,330
- Yeah.

930
00:35:59,348 --> 00:36:01,038
- You can shoot any one of those two.

931
00:36:01,043 --> 00:36:01,881
- Okay.

932
00:36:01,882 --> 00:36:02,706
- Let's see how close they come.

933
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,889
- They are really
- He's coming closer,

934
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:07,238
he's coming, get ready.

935
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:08,069
- Yeah.

936
00:36:12,043 --> 00:36:14,591
- Let's see if they stand.

937
00:36:14,592 --> 00:36:15,929
- Okay.

938
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:16,940
- Big males, those.

939
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,035
- Oh, fuck yeah.

940
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:21,461
(gun clicks)

941
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,549
- They're just playing,
give them some time.

942
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,676
Did you see the back of him?

943
00:36:28,677 --> 00:36:29,717
- The one over here?

944
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:30,561
- Right in front of you.

945
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:31,386
- Okay.

946
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:33,409
- He's got his head down.

947
00:36:33,413 --> 00:36:34,253
- Yep, over there.

948
00:36:34,254 --> 00:36:35,876
- I just want to range him first.

949
00:36:35,882 --> 00:36:36,722
- Yeah.

950
00:36:36,723 --> 00:36:39,045
- He's picking up the grass.

951
00:36:39,945 --> 00:36:42,105
Let's see if he comes out.

952
00:36:45,811 --> 00:36:46,829
- He just poked up, right?

953
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,656
- Yep.

954
00:36:49,264 --> 00:36:50,104
165.

955
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:54,459
Watch him.

956
00:37:04,331 --> 00:37:05,791
- Yeah, he went behind the

957
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:07,240
- Past the tree, you see it?

958
00:37:07,243 --> 00:37:08,153
- Yep, yep, yep.

959
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:10,980
- If he stands, you must take him.

960
00:37:15,188 --> 00:37:16,018
- Range him.

961
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:17,191
- I have, 165.

962
00:37:22,984 --> 00:37:25,324
Okay, he's looking away now.

963
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:28,206
- Alfredo, would you feel comfortable

964
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:29,183
standing and shooting?

965
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:30,505
- [Alfredo] Yes.

966
00:37:31,815 --> 00:37:35,305
- They are slowly feeding to the right.

967
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:38,415
- I can stand longer than I can sit.

968
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:41,076
(intense music)

969
00:37:56,264 --> 00:37:58,184
- Come with me, leave everything.

970
00:37:58,185 --> 00:37:59,598
Bring your rifle.

971
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,306
Come, come, come.

972
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,966
Stay low.

973
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:25,858
(music intensifies)

974
00:38:33,351 --> 00:38:35,021
Come, on the sticks.

975
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:41,432
Get on the sticks and be ready.

976
00:38:41,433 --> 00:38:43,433
I'll tell you which one.

977
00:38:44,933 --> 00:38:45,773
- Fucker.

978
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:49,336
- Stand still.

979
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:56,374
They're gonna come stand
here in front of us.

980
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,498
There's a male coming out here.

981
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:11,325
- Okay.

982
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:15,602
Just stand still, stand still.

983
00:39:18,173 --> 00:39:21,696
- They're gonna be these
two coming out here.

984
00:39:21,697 --> 00:39:22,647
See the two walking?

985
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:23,730
- Yeah.

986
00:39:23,731 --> 00:39:24,830
- Not the first one, the second one.

987
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:25,831
He's in the middle now.

988
00:39:25,832 --> 00:39:27,417
- Good.

989
00:39:27,418 --> 00:39:28,248
(whistling)

990
00:39:28,251 --> 00:39:30,421
(yelling)

991
00:39:31,499 --> 00:39:32,329
- Under the tree.

992
00:39:32,332 --> 00:39:33,602
- Yeah.

993
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:37,092
- The one that's at the
tree right now, right?

994
00:39:37,093 --> 00:39:37,933
- 259.

995
00:39:42,175 --> 00:39:45,505
One, two, third one, over
there is a little bush.

996
00:39:45,512 --> 00:39:47,219
- One, two, third.

997
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,050
- Over the bush.

998
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,643
- Right, I see him.

999
00:39:52,965 --> 00:39:55,375
(gun clicks)

1000
00:39:56,953 --> 00:39:58,203
- Range is 260.

1001
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,305
He's looking at you now, the second one.

1002
00:40:03,306 --> 00:40:04,246
Do you see him?

1003
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,470
- He's still at that bush, right?

1004
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:07,016
- Yes.

1005
00:40:07,017 --> 00:40:08,677
- Can you shoot him?

1006
00:40:09,898 --> 00:40:10,728
- Yeah.

1007
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:12,706
Fuck.

1008
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:17,154
- Wait.

1009
00:40:17,155 --> 00:40:18,607
- Yeah.

1010
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:20,189
- He's coming back.

1011
00:40:32,565 --> 00:40:33,975
Come, come, come.

1012
00:40:37,625 --> 00:40:38,455
Come.

1013
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:43,664
There he is, next to the tree.

1014
00:40:43,665 --> 00:40:45,695
- Got the sticks up, standing, felt really

1015
00:40:45,704 --> 00:40:49,496
comfortable, um, felt
steady and everything.

1016
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:52,457
And felt good about the shot placement.

1017
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,280
Mark goes shoot him.

1018
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:55,122
He's the one that's still there.

1019
00:40:55,123 --> 00:40:58,069
- Yes, shoot him, 185.
(gunshot)

1020
00:40:58,074 --> 00:40:59,074
Okay, again.

1021
00:41:00,149 --> 00:41:00,979
Watch him.

1022
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:11,871
- Fuck.

1023
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:22,922
- He's slowing down.

1024
00:41:26,225 --> 00:41:28,575
He's the last one now, he's gonna stand.

1025
00:41:28,578 --> 00:41:29,408
- Yeah.

1026
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:30,611
- That's him, the last one.

1027
00:41:30,612 --> 00:41:32,858
Try to get a shot into him.

1028
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,770
It's 320.

1029
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:36,763
- He's facing left, correct?

1030
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:39,661
- Yes, that's him, that's him.

1031
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:40,500
- So I can shoot?

1032
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:41,325
- Yes.

1033
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:45,378
(gunshot)

1034
00:41:45,384 --> 00:41:46,745
- Nope, missed him.

1035
00:41:46,746 --> 00:41:49,826
(gun cocks)

1036
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:51,227
They're moving the other way.

1037
00:41:51,231 --> 00:41:54,444
But he didn't drop. They took off,

1038
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:57,355
and at about 300 yards, he stopped.

1039
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:04,449
He slowed down, he stopped, turned around.

1040
00:42:06,121 --> 00:42:08,124
Ranged him again with the BDX.

1041
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,445
Got the dot on him, pulled
the trigger, missed,

1042
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:13,248
and then he took off
again, and we didn't see

1043
00:42:13,252 --> 00:42:15,732
him all day. And we spent about five hours

1044
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,638
looking for him.
- Really?

1045
00:42:17,643 --> 00:42:19,263
- Yeah. And we covered

1046
00:42:19,264 --> 00:42:20,554
a lot of area.
- A lot of ground.

1047
00:42:20,555 --> 00:42:22,582
- A lot of area, just
trying to look for him.

1048
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:25,165
I think I hit him right here.

1049
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,497
- Slightly clutching on,
- Yeah.

1050
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:27,844
- But shot good.

1051
00:42:29,082 --> 00:42:30,164
- [Luke] Blood?

1052
00:42:30,165 --> 00:42:31,405
- No blood.
- No blood.

1053
00:42:31,414 --> 00:42:32,254
- Oof.

1054
00:42:32,255 --> 00:42:33,327
- Yeah, yeah.

1055
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:37,437
- So you gotta, you got
work to do tomorrow?

1056
00:42:37,443 --> 00:42:39,969
- Yeah, we got work to do.

1057
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,930
- We'll round up some trackers,
and help you guys out.

1058
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:43,636
- Well, hopefully
- Always a chance.

1059
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:45,359
- Always a chance.
- I have all the confidence

1060
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,276
in the world in these

1061
00:42:46,283 --> 00:42:47,233
PH's and trackers.
- Oh yeah, same here, yep.

1062
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:49,991
- If I were you, don't
worry. They'll find it.

1063
00:42:49,992 --> 00:42:54,435
- Yeah. But that's the
interesting thing, you know?

1064
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:57,938
The previous days, I was excited about the

1065
00:42:59,866 --> 00:43:02,326
animals I hunted, and I
had excellent success with

1066
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:06,924
them, and this wasn't a
success, but that's part of it.

1067
00:43:08,182 --> 00:43:12,646
And, you know, you
compare the enthusiasm of

1068
00:43:12,647 --> 00:43:16,747
doing a job well, and
getting an animal down

1069
00:43:16,752 --> 00:43:19,252
quickly, so they don't suffer.

1070
00:43:20,237 --> 00:43:24,407
And I think that's a good
accomplishment, because it's

1071
00:43:24,413 --> 00:43:28,583
a sign that all the training
that I did works out,

1072
00:43:29,643 --> 00:43:32,073
and everything lines up,
and I did a good job.

1073
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:34,812
And this time, I think I
did a good job, everything

1074
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:38,211
lined up, but the results weren't there.

1075
00:43:38,213 --> 00:43:41,917
And so it's, you know,
I realize it's a part

1076
00:43:41,918 --> 00:43:44,648
of hunting. Like joe told me earlier.

1077
00:43:44,654 --> 00:43:47,525
If you don't miss, you're
not hunting, or something

1078
00:43:47,526 --> 00:43:48,376
like that.

1079
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:49,585
- Not hunting enough.

1080
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:52,288
- Just out of curiosity, and
I think we talked about this

1081
00:43:52,289 --> 00:43:54,987
last night, how many of
you think you practiced

1082
00:43:54,992 --> 00:43:57,992
enough shooting before you got here?

1083
00:43:59,529 --> 00:44:00,559
- You can always practice more.

1084
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,980
- I think a key part of that, Richard, is

1085
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:09,509
people think practicing
means going to the range,

1086
00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:11,227
sighting their rifles,

1087
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:13,077
throwing 20 yards down range
- Shooting groups?

1088
00:44:13,078 --> 00:44:14,998
Shooting groups.
- Yeah.

1089
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:18,862
- Yes, sight your rifle, take
as many shots as it needs

1090
00:44:18,863 --> 00:44:22,818
to zero your rifle.
Key practice is getting

1091
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,369
to field positions. Shooting off sticks,

1092
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:29,669
shooting uncomfortable from
a tree, seated position,

1093
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,570
prone position, whatever the situation

1094
00:44:31,574 --> 00:44:33,704
may call for. And that's
keeping the pressure,

1095
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:37,030
but yeah. Run 10 yards, and then see how

1096
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,882
quickly it takes you to
stabilize and take a shot.

1097
00:44:40,883 --> 00:44:44,909
- Is that what you were
saying with the gemsbok?

1098
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:48,630
You felt that, a little bit of anxiety.

1099
00:44:48,632 --> 00:44:50,671
- Massive amount of anxiety.
- To get the shot off as

1100
00:44:50,672 --> 00:44:51,522
quickly as possible.

1101
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:53,409
- We just traveled 8000 miles, and if

1102
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,860
I don't take this shot
right now, they're gonna

1103
00:44:54,861 --> 00:44:56,926
go away, and I'm never
gonna get a shot again.

1104
00:44:56,928 --> 00:45:01,038
- Exactly, and to try
and simulate that is key.

1105
00:45:01,044 --> 00:45:02,564
And to try and get yourself into the most

1106
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:06,715
uncomfortable, realistic
hunting situation.

1107
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,910
I think that's real practice,
that's practical practice.

1108
00:45:09,914 --> 00:45:12,534
- To sum it up, I mean, zeroing your rifle

1109
00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:13,365
- Is key.

1110
00:45:13,368 --> 00:45:14,818
- Well, zeroing your rifle
is key, but zeroing your

1111
00:45:14,821 --> 00:45:16,095
rifle is not practice.

1112
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:17,466
- No.
- I think that's exactly what

1113
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:18,300
you're saying, Luke.

1114
00:45:18,303 --> 00:45:20,131
- No, and the funny thing about it is the

1115
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:22,138
people that, the tactical
community, or the

1116
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:24,839
people that carry for personal protection,

1117
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:27,061
defensive handgun owners, they seem

1118
00:45:27,063 --> 00:45:31,522
to have this thing where
they practice religiously.

1119
00:45:31,523 --> 00:45:34,766
- But they practice religiously doing,

1120
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:36,037
practicing skills.

1121
00:45:36,042 --> 00:45:38,201
- Practicing skills,
but the hunter, so many

1122
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:40,550
hunters just sight their rifle in, shoot

1123
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:41,796
a couple groups,

1124
00:45:41,798 --> 00:45:43,767
and think I'm good to go.
- True.

1125
00:45:43,768 --> 00:45:46,316
- Exactly, I mean, Gunsite
does all the practical

1126
00:45:46,317 --> 00:45:47,485
tactical stuff.

1127
00:45:47,493 --> 00:45:49,231
- They don't even have
a shooting bench there.

1128
00:45:49,232 --> 00:45:50,685
- Exactly, but a lot of people go there.

1129
00:45:50,689 --> 00:45:52,007
- Yep, yep.

1130
00:45:52,008 --> 00:45:53,518
- But I bet you if you
ask them how many people

1131
00:45:53,523 --> 00:45:56,163
do their hunters courses,
they'll say, there's

1132
00:45:56,164 --> 00:45:57,828
a huge margin.
- Yep.

1133
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:01,329
- The minority go there.
And that needs to change.

1134
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,792
Hunters needs to practice that.

1135
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:05,261
- It applies to everybody, I mean, even my

1136
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,688
daughter knows it. I mean we were hunting

1137
00:46:07,689 --> 00:46:10,748
our pigs one day, and
I missed two shots, and

1138
00:46:10,749 --> 00:46:12,007
she turned and said
well, daddy, you should

1139
00:46:12,008 --> 00:46:12,835
practice more.

1140
00:46:12,843 --> 00:46:14,252
(all laugh)

1141
00:46:14,253 --> 00:46:17,717
- Pretty obvious what the problem was.

1142
00:46:17,718 --> 00:46:18,988
- I'm spotting the pigs
and you missed, you should

1143
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:21,926
practice some more.
- Well done.

1144
00:46:21,927 --> 00:46:24,237
- One of the
- Your kids will let you know

1145
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,836
when you mess up.
- True.

1146
00:46:26,837 --> 00:46:29,607
- I don't even think it's
just your riflemanship

1147
00:46:29,611 --> 00:46:31,001
skills.
- Yeah.

1148
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:34,564
- I think it's a familiarity
with your gear, you know?

1149
00:46:34,565 --> 00:46:37,501
And sometimes hunters
experiment with gear.

1150
00:46:37,502 --> 00:46:40,155
We're trying some new gear here.

1151
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:43,367
Just curious, how are you guys interfacing

1152
00:46:43,373 --> 00:46:44,782
with the equipment?

1153
00:46:44,783 --> 00:46:48,201
I mean, have you had any issues, or?

1154
00:46:48,202 --> 00:46:49,162
- No, not really.

1155
00:46:49,163 --> 00:46:53,167
- I'll tell you one thing
that's impressed me hugely.

1156
00:46:53,169 --> 00:46:55,969
- One of the biggest
problems that we get coming

1157
00:46:55,971 --> 00:46:57,531
here, and I mean all the PH's around here.

1158
00:46:57,534 --> 00:47:01,169
Mark, Leon, they can attest to it, is

1159
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:04,670
when clients arrive, and unpack their bag,

1160
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,065
I'd say at least 70,

1161
00:47:07,066 --> 00:47:08,816
80% of them.
- Wow.

1162
00:47:08,822 --> 00:47:13,119
- They're inches off. Sometimes
not even on the paper.

1163
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,485
- Oh you mean with all
the rifles holding zero?

1164
00:47:15,486 --> 00:47:16,346
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1165
00:47:16,349 --> 00:47:17,519
- And all TSA.

1166
00:47:18,664 --> 00:47:20,744
- Yeah, the bipolar gorilla, right?

1167
00:47:20,745 --> 00:47:23,316
(all chatting)

1168
00:47:24,798 --> 00:47:27,577
- I mean, you guys had
luggages arriving here, I mean.

1169
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:30,436
- Wait til you guys
get back to the states.

1170
00:47:30,439 --> 00:47:32,719
- But one thing that
impressed me about that,

1171
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,244
is we don't have one
rifle here that didn't

1172
00:47:36,245 --> 00:47:37,755
hold zero after taking it out of those

1173
00:47:37,759 --> 00:47:38,649
SKB Cases.

1174
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,796
- Yeah, my rifle, we were
hitting steel at 400.

1175
00:47:40,797 --> 00:47:41,645
- Yeah.

1176
00:47:41,646 --> 00:47:42,555
- Out of the, no adjustments.

1177
00:47:42,561 --> 00:47:43,391
- Yeah, same here.

1178
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:44,884
- I could not believe that.

1179
00:47:44,885 --> 00:47:47,131
- Cases, quality gun cases.

1180
00:47:48,523 --> 00:47:49,643
There's something, when you go back,

1181
00:47:49,644 --> 00:47:51,381
somebody says hey, you did that.

1182
00:47:51,382 --> 00:47:53,445
If I go, what's a big thing I,

1183
00:47:53,447 --> 00:47:56,306
do you think it comes
back to the practice?

1184
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:57,865
You think that's the big thing?

1185
00:47:57,868 --> 00:48:00,418
- I would say, hike four
times as much as you

1186
00:48:00,421 --> 00:48:01,811
think you need to hike.

1187
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:03,444
- Climb rocky cold here.

1188
00:48:03,445 --> 00:48:06,145
(all chatting, laughing)

1189
00:48:06,152 --> 00:48:09,007
- One thing I can say, is, you know,

1190
00:48:09,008 --> 00:48:11,028
you were talking about hike four times

1191
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:11,859
as much as you think you need to.

1192
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:12,700
- Yeah.

1193
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:13,685
- Hike with your gear.

1194
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:15,008
- Yeah.

1195
00:48:15,009 --> 00:48:16,628
- And find out, find out what falls

1196
00:48:16,629 --> 00:48:19,066
off, hooks up, snags on
- Rifle slings.

1197
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:21,567
- Don't worry about that,
the PH can carry it.

1198
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:23,826
(all laugh)

1199
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:25,409
- I got the best PH.

1200
00:48:25,411 --> 00:48:27,261
- He's got a load limit of
like 24 pounds, look at him.

1201
00:48:27,262 --> 00:48:29,627
- Hey, Leon.
- I still need to give up

1202
00:48:29,628 --> 00:48:32,075
the mountain gear, come on.

1203
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,539
- No, I just, I think it all
goes back to the practice.

1204
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,940
Because you spend all that
effort, and equipment,

1205
00:48:37,941 --> 00:48:39,777
and gear, and money to come over here,

1206
00:48:39,778 --> 00:48:40,845
and don't shoot well.

1207
00:48:40,849 --> 00:48:41,889
- Yeah, let me add to that.

1208
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:44,266
Just because I've done it,
too. When you go on a big

1209
00:48:44,267 --> 00:48:47,614
hunt, such as this, I
mean, you can consider

1210
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,155
this almost a once in a
lifetime hunt for a lot

1211
00:48:49,163 --> 00:48:50,252
of people.
- Yep.

1212
00:48:50,253 --> 00:48:52,108
- You want to get new stuff. And

1213
00:48:52,109 --> 00:48:54,534
you want it to be top of
the line. And that's great,

1214
00:48:54,535 --> 00:48:56,025
but if you can't work it
properly, doesn't have to

1215
00:48:56,027 --> 00:48:59,357
be fancy. But just get off, even if it's

1216
00:49:01,401 --> 00:49:06,151
your dad's old Mossberg Patriot,
old Winchester Model 70.

1217
00:49:07,335 --> 00:49:08,654
It doesn't matter what it is.
- No.

1218
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,415
- Use it, and get off the line, grab those

1219
00:49:10,424 --> 00:49:13,472
shooting sticks, and sit
and stand, just use it.

1220
00:49:13,473 --> 00:49:14,524
We were talking about

1221
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:15,365
that today, too.
- Yeah.

1222
00:49:15,373 --> 00:49:16,343
- Doesn't have to be fancy.

1223
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:18,078
I'd take that rifle anywhere in the world.

1224
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,309
Because if you look at the scratches on my

1225
00:49:19,313 --> 00:49:20,863
arms, I am not exactly graceful going

1226
00:49:20,864 --> 00:49:22,665
through the bush. So we decided that

1227
00:49:22,666 --> 00:49:24,076
the only thing that doesn't have thorns

1228
00:49:24,077 --> 00:49:26,047
in this country is the critters, right?

1229
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:29,809
- Oh, but you shot again.
- Like a toothpick.

1230
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:31,850
- Well, the common misconceptions.

1231
00:49:31,851 --> 00:49:34,077
One, I'm going to Africa on
a once in a lifetime hunt,

1232
00:49:34,078 --> 00:49:35,727
I gotta buy new gear.
- No, misconception.

1233
00:49:35,728 --> 00:49:39,775
- Two, I've hunted
whitetail deer all my life,

1234
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:40,616
I'm a good shot.

1235
00:49:40,624 --> 00:49:42,087
- Mm, yeah.

1236
00:49:42,088 --> 00:49:44,537
- And three, I can't
afford to go to Africa,

1237
00:49:44,538 --> 00:49:45,855
because it's too expensive.

1238
00:49:45,856 --> 00:49:46,965
- False, false, false.

1239
00:49:46,966 --> 00:49:48,796
- False, false. Because I mean, this, yeah

1240
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:50,567
it may be a once in a
lifetime experience, but

1241
00:49:50,568 --> 00:49:53,237
it's not a once in a lifetime
expense, by any measure.

1242
00:49:53,238 --> 00:49:54,228
- Right.
- Definitely.

1243
00:49:54,229 --> 00:49:56,876
And you and I had that exact
conversation today about

1244
00:49:56,878 --> 00:49:59,208
the Mossberg Patriot debate.

1245
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:03,100
I mean, I know a lot of guys in the states

1246
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:06,119
especially, have synthetic
stocks because of

1247
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:07,665
weather issues.

1248
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:09,206
And I get that, but everybody

1249
00:50:09,212 --> 00:50:12,252
has an old wood rifle.
And if you want to go buy

1250
00:50:12,254 --> 00:50:14,601
the wood classic, I mean that, you know

1251
00:50:14,602 --> 00:50:15,761
what I mean?
- Well, there's something

1252
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,529
about wood and, wood and steel

1253
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:18,410
in Africa.

1254
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:20,775
- Exactly, what a good relation.

1255
00:50:20,776 --> 00:50:23,446
That's a few hundred
dollar rifle, you know?

1256
00:50:23,447 --> 00:50:24,535
It's under $1,000.

1257
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:27,121
- Yeah. The rifle I
have with me, I used it

1258
00:50:27,122 --> 00:50:29,368
last fall to take a
Newfoundland Grand Slam.

1259
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:30,233
- Yeah.

1260
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:31,786
- Moose, caribou, and black bear.

1261
00:50:31,792 --> 00:50:34,851
I took it to Wyoming this
winter for a coyote hunt.

1262
00:50:34,852 --> 00:50:37,547
And now it's here, it's in Africa

1263
00:50:37,548 --> 00:50:39,054
for kudus.
- Yep.

1264
00:50:39,055 --> 00:50:42,365
- Warthog if you can just find one.

1265
00:50:42,369 --> 00:50:44,539
I just need one, just one.

1266
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,823
- They make really great rifles.

1267
00:50:47,824 --> 00:50:49,681
And inexpensive.

1268
00:50:49,682 --> 00:50:53,352
- Listen, unlike Mark
and Alfredo, we didn't

1269
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:58,041
go to Kimberly today, and
I did not get a milkshake,

1270
00:50:58,042 --> 00:50:59,312
and I'm getting kind of hungry, so can we

1271
00:50:59,313 --> 00:51:02,389
figure out what we're doing tomorrow?

1272
00:51:03,511 --> 00:51:04,861
What's the plan?
- Well we know what,

1273
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:07,660
we know what we're doing.
- I'm starting to think,

1274
00:51:07,661 --> 00:51:09,141
we've got to find out what
deodorant you're using,

1275
00:51:09,144 --> 00:51:11,070
because every night, you tell us about

1276
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:13,006
the animals coming towards you.

1277
00:51:13,007 --> 00:51:15,337
(all laugh)

1278
00:51:16,964 --> 00:51:18,444
- And he hadn't showered
since he's been here.

1279
00:51:18,445 --> 00:51:20,668
- Yeah, I noticed.

1280
00:51:20,673 --> 00:51:23,596
- Cheers my friend.
- Thank you.

1281
00:51:23,597 --> 00:51:26,996
- No, seriously, what's
everybody doing tomorrow, you?

1282
00:51:26,997 --> 00:51:28,117
- Early to bed, early to rise,

1283
00:51:28,121 --> 00:51:30,141
makes a man shoot the warthogs.

1284
00:51:30,143 --> 00:51:31,675
- There you go.

1285
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:33,286
- And will it be blesbok?

1286
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:34,139
- Yes.

1287
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,156
- You're back after.

1288
00:51:35,157 --> 00:51:36,416
- We'll get a team out with you guys

1289
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:38,236
in the morning.
- Yeah, good.

1290
00:51:38,237 --> 00:51:40,365
- And I suppose we'll be
after the old (inaudible)

1291
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:41,707
again, (inaudible)

1292
00:51:41,714 --> 00:51:42,552
- Yeah, what he said.

1293
00:51:42,553 --> 00:51:43,377
- There's gotta be

1294
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,370
still one kudu left.
- Yeah.

1295
00:51:44,373 --> 00:51:46,433
- We all couldn't have shot them all.

1296
00:51:46,434 --> 00:51:49,159
- All right, well listen, cheers.

1297
00:51:49,163 --> 00:51:50,284
- Guys, congratulations.

1298
00:51:50,285 --> 00:51:51,364
- Alfredo, good luck tomorrow.

1299
00:51:51,365 --> 00:51:53,565
And Leon, we are gonna get
the big warthog, not you.

1300
00:51:53,573 --> 00:51:54,724
(glasses clink)

1301
00:51:54,725 --> 00:51:57,385
(intense music)

1302
00:52:01,012 --> 00:52:01,850
- Howdy.

1303
00:52:01,851 --> 00:52:02,675
- I have a question for you.

1304
00:52:02,678 --> 00:52:03,747
- Yeah, sure.

1305
00:52:03,748 --> 00:52:05,248
- Do you want me to leave a bullet in the

1306
00:52:05,249 --> 00:52:06,526
chamber, or out of the chamber?

1307
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,165
- Whatever you're comfortable with.

1308
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:10,149
So, if you're comfortable with a bullet in

1309
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:11,898
the chamber, I've got no problem with it.

1310
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,743
- Okay.

1311
00:52:13,658 --> 00:52:15,078
- It's up to you.

1312
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,757
(gun clicks)

1313
00:52:18,758 --> 00:52:19,878
- That's what I need.
- Good man.

1314
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,380
(vocal music)

1315
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:23,359
- Geoffrey, do you think
I have enough luggage?

1316
00:53:23,361 --> 00:53:24,911
- Well, when you talk to my staff, I think

1317
00:53:24,912 --> 00:53:27,649
you have a bit too much luggage.

1318
00:53:27,652 --> 00:53:28,752
- So this is what happens when you come

1319
00:53:28,754 --> 00:53:30,215
to Africa for a month.

1320
00:53:30,216 --> 00:53:31,526
You've got to bring a lot of stuff.

1321
00:53:31,529 --> 00:53:33,259
Especially if you're
running video, and taking

1322
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,706
cameras, and getting all kinds of imagery.

1323
00:53:35,714 --> 00:53:39,372
But, the cool thing
about it is, SKB Cases,

1324
00:53:39,373 --> 00:53:42,332
most people think of them as rifle cases.

1325
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:45,113
And to years in a row,
I've used SKB Cases,

1326
00:53:45,114 --> 00:53:47,732
I've come to Africa, got
my rifle out of the case,

1327
00:53:47,734 --> 00:53:50,215
and the zero was perfect.

1328
00:53:50,216 --> 00:53:51,975
- Richard, that's an
important subject you bring

1329
00:53:51,976 --> 00:53:54,226
up there, I mean, we
see hundreds of rifles

1330
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,772
travel from all over the
world to Africa each year,

1331
00:53:56,773 --> 00:54:00,092
and most of those guns need
to be re-zeroed, whether

1332
00:54:00,093 --> 00:54:02,572
it's a few inches, or even off the page.

1333
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:05,591
Now I will say that for a fact, SKB Cases,

1334
00:54:05,592 --> 00:54:07,255
we've had the least of that.

1335
00:54:07,256 --> 00:54:08,746
- Yeah, and that's because what I call the

1336
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,340
bipolar gorillas that
work in baggage claim.

1337
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:12,375
- Exactly.

1338
00:54:12,376 --> 00:54:14,106
- You know, at the airports and what not.

1339
00:54:14,114 --> 00:54:16,311
But here's the other thing with SKB Cases.

1340
00:54:16,312 --> 00:54:18,088
A lot of people like to bring canvas bags,

1341
00:54:18,093 --> 00:54:20,113
and duffel bags, and what
not. And they'll rip open,

1342
00:54:20,114 --> 00:54:22,291
and you can lose your stuff.
Just get a big SKB Case

1343
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:24,390
like this, and put all
your gear in it. All your

1344
00:54:24,391 --> 00:54:27,587
clothes, and whatever.
Cameras, video recorders,

1345
00:54:27,592 --> 00:54:29,342
I mean they got you covered
for any type of baggage

1346
00:54:29,343 --> 00:54:32,405
you want to bring to
Africa, so you can have

1347
00:54:32,413 --> 00:54:33,735
a great hunt.

1348
00:54:33,736 --> 00:54:35,226
And then get your stuff home
without it being tore all

1349
00:54:35,233 --> 00:54:36,375
to pieces.

1350
00:54:36,376 --> 00:54:37,866
- Exactly, and these
little ones over here,

1351
00:54:37,873 --> 00:54:39,551
a lot of the airlines want you to travel

1352
00:54:39,552 --> 00:54:40,940
separately, your ammunition separately.

1353
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:41,766
- Exactly.

1354
00:54:41,769 --> 00:54:42,599
- And these are perfect for that.

1355
00:54:42,602 --> 00:54:43,740
- And you can lock them
up, your ammunition

1356
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:45,319
is secure, and you got
everything you need.

1357
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,674
So, if you're coming to Africa, actually,

1358
00:54:47,675 --> 00:54:49,695
if you're going anywhere
and you're taking a rifle,

1359
00:54:49,696 --> 00:54:54,154
or important stuff like
cameras and optics, SKB Cases.

1360
00:54:54,155 --> 00:54:56,815
(music resumes)

1361
00:55:34,611 --> 00:55:35,641
- You mind if I check out your knife,

1362
00:55:35,642 --> 00:55:36,845
just to see it?
- Sure.

1363
00:55:36,851 --> 00:55:38,728
- I'm a bit of a knife buff.

1364
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:41,249
Oh, that's a nice one,
the Spyderco Flipper.

1365
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,907
Carbon fiber, that's beautiful.

1366
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:45,508
And that blade is a good profile.

1367
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:48,039
- I like the blade, because it's short,

1368
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,565
and it's easy to handle.
- Yep.

1369
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:52,069
So, yeah, I'm just
checking to see if there is

1370
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:55,554
any glints on the edge
here. Yep, definitely

1371
00:55:55,555 --> 00:55:56,645
needs some work.

1372
00:55:56,649 --> 00:55:58,229
- It's a working knife, so

1373
00:55:58,232 --> 00:55:59,591
it might need some attention.
- Yeah, yeah.

1374
00:55:59,592 --> 00:56:03,509
So I'll just use this,
my Work Sharp tool here,

1375
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:04,620
knife sharpener.

1376
00:56:04,624 --> 00:56:06,050
(knife scrapes)

1377
00:56:06,051 --> 00:56:08,109
So what I like about this is that it has

1378
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,066
a guide built in, so you can keep that

1379
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:12,977
consistent edge as you move across.

1380
00:56:15,771 --> 00:56:18,191
It has this coarse stone, they're diamond

1381
00:56:18,192 --> 00:56:20,370
encrusted stones.

1382
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:22,371
And then go to the fine.

1383
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,740
And then it has a ceramic
for very fine, and again,

1384
00:56:28,744 --> 00:56:31,543
it still has those guides.

1385
00:56:31,544 --> 00:56:33,623
- I like it because it's
light, and it's manageable.

1386
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:34,626
- Yeah.

1387
00:56:34,627 --> 00:56:35,747
- Easy to carry.
- Yeah.

1388
00:56:35,748 --> 00:56:38,924
And these plates reverse
to a shiny surface,

1389
00:56:38,925 --> 00:56:41,925
so they won't be abrasive on whatever, if

1390
00:56:41,927 --> 00:56:44,944
you carry it in a bag or whatever.

1391
00:56:44,945 --> 00:56:48,445
- [Man] Grab that dirt
(inaudible) dirt, dirt!

1392
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:49,489
- You scratch my back
- Hey,

1393
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,910
Like that.
- hey!

1394
00:56:52,551 --> 00:56:53,381
Hey!

1395
00:56:54,568 --> 00:56:55,398
Fuck!

1396
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:59,007
(laughing)

1397
00:56:59,011 --> 00:57:01,451
- Oh, my nuts.
- Found my nuts,

1398
00:57:01,453 --> 00:57:02,956
found my nuts.

1399
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:05,537
(all chatting)

1400
00:57:07,192 --> 00:57:10,702
- [Woman] I was just chillin, man.

1401
00:57:10,704 --> 00:57:12,174
- [Man] With a 600 millimeter lens.

1402
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:14,497
- [Man] Uh, I got full nuts.

1403
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:16,859
- [Woman] Full nuts, yes.

1404
00:57:16,864 --> 00:57:19,454
- [Man] All right, we're done.
