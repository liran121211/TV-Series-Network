1
00:00:00,495 --> 00:00:03,605
- [Narrator] Previously
on WildCraft South Africa.

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:05,488
- Luke, good to see you.

3
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:07,258
- This place is so beautiful
not even you could ruin it.

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,747
(laughing)

5
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:09,638
- Welcome back.

6
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:11,114
- Hey, old man.

7
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:11,945
- Hey.

8
00:00:11,948 --> 00:00:12,828
- Looking grayer than me.

9
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:14,605
- A little bit, getting there.

10
00:00:14,612 --> 00:00:15,502
- Come on I'll show you the camp,

11
00:00:15,502 --> 00:00:16,492
show you the PHs.

12
00:00:16,493 --> 00:00:17,735
- [Joe] A kudu.

13
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,530
Right off that point.

14
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,970
- [Leon] There's another
one coming down Joe.

15
00:00:28,971 --> 00:00:30,275
He's the one we want to take.

16
00:00:30,276 --> 00:00:31,106
Do you see him?

17
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:31,939
- [Joe] It is.

18
00:00:31,942 --> 00:00:32,870
- [Leon] There's two of them.

19
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:33,698
There's a smaller bull
on the left hand side,

20
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,160
the one you pointed out.

21
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:35,991
- [Joe] Yeah.

22
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,474
- [Leon] There's one on the far right.

23
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:39,688
There he comes, there he comes,

24
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:41,597
right on the crest of the hill.

25
00:00:41,598 --> 00:00:42,508
Right on the crest of the hill.

26
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:44,041
Here he comes.
- [Joe] Oh yeah.

27
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:45,323
- [Leon] He's still walking
you can see he's much bigger

28
00:00:45,324 --> 00:00:47,260
than the rest of them.
- [Joe] Yep.

29
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:48,295
- No, no Joe.

30
00:00:48,296 --> 00:00:50,306
Your barrel is in line with the rock pile.

31
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:51,357
- [Joe] Oh, I see it.

32
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:54,318
That's going to be a problem.

33
00:00:54,319 --> 00:00:57,989
- [Leon] Joe try and
get up here if you can.

34
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,340
If you're ready you can take him.

35
00:01:05,493 --> 00:01:09,279
(suspenseful music)
(gun shooting)

36
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,690
- Shot, good solid hit.

37
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:15,467
We kinda, yahoo, you know,
but one of those deals,

38
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:17,008
and so we relaxed a little bit,

39
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,399
and we went down to look for him,

40
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:21,361
and thought he'd be piled up
down at the base of the hill.

41
00:01:21,364 --> 00:01:24,114
(dramatic music)

42
00:01:33,277 --> 00:01:34,637
But it wasn't there.

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,310
And so then the tracking was on.

44
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:40,375
- It's a piece of bone.

45
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:43,127
(dramatic music)

46
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:47,716
Geoffrey, Geoffrey, Geoffrey?

47
00:01:47,717 --> 00:01:49,077
- All day we've been
looking for that animal,

48
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:50,536
and we haven't found him yet.

49
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:52,212
So I mean that's why I said, you know,

50
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:54,910
highest high to lowest low,

51
00:01:54,913 --> 00:01:56,723
is just that we had to come into dark,

52
00:01:56,724 --> 00:02:01,105
and we have to go out, we're
gonna go look for him tomorrow.

53
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:04,509
I'm expecting a sleepless night.

54
00:02:04,512 --> 00:02:07,102
(upbeat music)

55
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,030
(upbeat music)

56
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:21,510
- [Richard] An African Safari
is filled with many things.

57
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,666
It's filled with beauty, exotic wildlife,

58
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:27,567
and some of the most breathtaking
scenery on planet Earth.

59
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:31,561
But hunting in Africa
is just that, hunting.

60
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:34,670
And as all hunters know,
nothing ever really

61
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:36,179
goes as planned.

62
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,310
Setting out to locate,
stalk, ethically kill,

63
00:02:38,314 --> 00:02:42,116
and utilize the resources
of a wild animal,

64
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:46,145
is almost always filled
trails and tribulations.

65
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:48,706
The woodsmanship skills of
the hunter and the guide,

66
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,630
along with the hunters
ability as a rifleman,

67
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:55,048
or what ultimately determines
the success of failure

68
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,720
of the hunt.

69
00:02:56,724 --> 00:02:58,660
- I think the big thing
is because the trail

70
00:02:58,661 --> 00:02:59,756
is split up there.

71
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,196
He might of not come
down, he might have stayed

72
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:03,636
parallel with the hill and just went.

73
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:05,357
- He was this way I did see it.

74
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:07,596
- [Leon] No I also don't
see any tracks there.

75
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:08,722
- Yeah.

76
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:12,126
- But there's a lot of
tracks going down though.

77
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:15,075
I think what we do,
Dougie, is just go down

78
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:17,986
into this valley and let's walk up.

79
00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:23,498
- We looked and looked, and
we just weren't finding him,

80
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,424
we were going slow through here.

81
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:28,520
I'd get inpatient on Douglas,
with who was watching

82
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:30,867
track to track, blood drop, blood drop.

83
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:34,105
And I'd keep looking ahead, looking ahead,

84
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,563
thinking we'd see something.

85
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:37,609
But we didn't find him.

86
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,517
- You see the, there's the road,

87
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:40,348
okay.

88
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,106
Yeah it's far out.

89
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:47,157
Road, little bit of bushes,
that first set of bushes,

90
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:48,736
and the second lot.

91
00:03:49,832 --> 00:03:52,582
(dramatic music)

92
00:03:55,807 --> 00:03:59,137
Maybe what I can do is just ask if there's

93
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:01,224
a few more trackers.

94
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:02,884
See if they can just split out

95
00:04:02,885 --> 00:04:04,375
and have a quick look for that.

96
00:04:04,382 --> 00:04:05,546
- I have to find that kudu.

97
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:06,627
- Yeah that's what I'm saying.

98
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:07,473
- Yeah.

99
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:15,304
Where do you think that kudu is?

100
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:18,456
- [Walkie Talkie] Power on.
- Priority.

101
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,853
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff?

102
00:04:21,883 --> 00:04:24,435
- Geoffrey brought additional trackers

103
00:04:24,436 --> 00:04:28,486
and some other employees,
and we did a beat across

104
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,390
the pasture which was everybody lined up

105
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:33,617
and walked across hoping
to kick that kudu out

106
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:35,948
or at least find sign of it.

107
00:04:38,815 --> 00:04:41,565
(dramatic music)

108
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,139
Down in the valley, we were
just about to go down it,

109
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,096
and a kudu ran out, and Leon
shouted, "It's limping."

110
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:51,847
(dramatic music)

111
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:59,481
So we hustled over there,
followed these tracks

112
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:01,770
for a little bit into this dry bush,

113
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:04,977
and heard this huff and there he was,

114
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,760
and seeing him pointing and
I'm trying to get on him,

115
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:09,585
and he takes off.

116
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:13,001
Which was good to see him
but discouraging that he

117
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:16,472
was in such good shape that
he could still run like that.

118
00:05:16,473 --> 00:05:18,245
- You see him, Joe?

119
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:19,076
- Yeah.

120
00:05:21,496 --> 00:05:22,535
Up in the rocks?

121
00:05:22,536 --> 00:05:25,605
- Yes, on this side of the hill.

122
00:05:25,606 --> 00:05:29,266
- It was trying to, it was
going up another rocky culpie

123
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:33,879
and so we ran ahead of
Geoffrey, and we got to where

124
00:05:33,883 --> 00:05:37,522
we could kinda get a clearing
and we could see him,

125
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:39,643
he would stop, he'd look
back, and he would keep going.

126
00:05:39,644 --> 00:05:41,749
And he was about half way
up, and I knew if he got

127
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,248
over that hill we were back to square one.

128
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:47,374
- Okay Joe what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna put

129
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,572
the sticks up, I'll arrange them,

130
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:52,960
and soon as he stands I
need you to put a shot in.

131
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:53,803
- All right.

132
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:55,826
Leon kinda turned to me and said,

133
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:59,534
you know, this is gonna be fast, you know

134
00:05:59,535 --> 00:06:02,115
if you got a shot just take it.

135
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:04,942
- You still see him?

136
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:05,892
- Yeah.

137
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,465
Right by that bush.

138
00:06:08,838 --> 00:06:11,338
- Take a few deep breaths Joe.

139
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,792
- So we also, actually Leon took the time

140
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,288
to set up his shooting sticks.

141
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:20,257
Where is he?

142
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:22,906
- Look up the side of the hill,

143
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:24,118
just behind that bush.

144
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:24,961
- Behind.

145
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:26,366
- Come walking out the left hand side.

146
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:29,701
Hold a second I'm gonna get you a range.

147
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,878
Joe he's 167 yards.

148
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,219
- I got on it, put it on it.

149
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,516
- Deep breaths, gently squeeze the trigger

150
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:39,944
whenever you're ready.
- Okay.

151
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:45,418
Shot, whack, and the kudu went down.

152
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,610
(gun shots)

153
00:06:49,614 --> 00:06:50,454
- Good shot.

154
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:51,607
Well done Joe.

155
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,115
- Finally.
- Shake my hand.

156
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,449
- Finally.
- Finally got him.

157
00:06:58,594 --> 00:06:59,835
So impressed with you.

158
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,706
Awesome.

159
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:04,407
- And out was a big sign of relief,

160
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:07,577
but after what we'd been
through I wasn't gonna

161
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:10,828
rest until we got up there,
so we hustled right up there

162
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,466
and sure enough, behind those bushes,

163
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:16,507
there was my kudu, finally.

164
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:19,681
And I was able to put my hands on him.

165
00:07:21,548 --> 00:07:23,068
Make sure.

166
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:24,111
- Yeah he's done.

167
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:26,137
Well done.
(laughing)

168
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,090
Congratulations.
- Finally.

169
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:28,468
- Well done sir.
- Finally.

170
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:30,191
- Make your rifle safe
there if you don't mind.

171
00:07:30,192 --> 00:07:33,456
We've come along way to get this oak.

172
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,970
- There's that shot from yesterday.

173
00:07:35,974 --> 00:07:40,333
- Yeah it's just a little
bit too far forward.

174
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,430
It's right on the shoulder.

175
00:07:42,431 --> 00:07:45,017
If it had just been a little bit back.

176
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:47,868
- It didn't seem to
slow him down that much.

177
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:50,022
- No, it did not at all.

178
00:07:50,023 --> 00:07:51,484
He came quite a ways.

179
00:07:51,485 --> 00:07:52,895
- [Joe] How far would you say?

180
00:07:52,902 --> 00:07:54,172
- [Leon] Joe, I think about seven

181
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,465
or eight miles this morning.

182
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:57,076
- [Joe] And up and down mountains too.

183
00:07:57,082 --> 00:07:58,372
- Yeah, it's crazy.

184
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:00,483
We had a discussion yesterday
while we were tracking him.

185
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:03,478
Just looking at the
hooves, and you would think

186
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:05,475
animal this size would have bigger hooves.

187
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:06,492
- Yeah.
- But you saw the terrain

188
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:07,542
that they run in.

189
00:08:07,543 --> 00:08:09,098
So it will be very difficult for him

190
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:11,336
to move around here if the
hooves were any bigger.

191
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:13,348
So the hooves are quite small actually

192
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:15,622
for the size of animal, but
it is because of the terrain.

193
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:17,719
- Yeah cause then when
I stopped and asked you,

194
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,207
you know what that track
was, you said, kudu,

195
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:23,136
and I said, a small one,
and Douglas said no big.

196
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:24,057
- [Leon] Yes.

197
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:25,418
- And I thought oh wow really.

198
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,709
Cause I guess I was expecting--

199
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,330
- Yeah because the other
thing that happened

200
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:30,379
is that you saw us with oryx track,

201
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,445
and remember it looked a lot bigger.

202
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:33,876
But the big thing is
what you must remember

203
00:08:33,877 --> 00:08:35,717
with the oryx that it's
a desert dwelling animal,

204
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:38,257
but normally most of the
time they're in Namibia,

205
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:39,626
they were introduced here.

206
00:08:39,632 --> 00:08:41,611
And the big thing is to walk in the sand,

207
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:43,181
it's like deflating your car tires.

208
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:45,529
So it will carry the
weight, and that's why

209
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,190
there's a bigger hooves to just spread the

210
00:08:47,191 --> 00:08:49,275
weight over a bigger area.

211
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:50,607
- That makes sense.

212
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,238
But yeah you're right with all the rocks,

213
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,299
they gotta step in between them.

214
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,131
- [Leon] Yes.

215
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,574
- Like we're supposed
to, but with my big feet

216
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,780
I (laughing), I stumble.
- We stumble.

217
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:00,301
We stumble sometimes.

218
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:03,052
(dramatic music)

219
00:09:08,434 --> 00:09:09,834
- As it turns out that shot hit about

220
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:14,240
two inches a little bit
forward on his shoulder,

221
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:17,261
just a two inches back
he would of been down.

222
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:19,510
So that was the difference between

223
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:23,574
instant elation and finding that animal,

224
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:28,235
and a night of worry, and
another whole day of tracking.

225
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,705
And the work that we put in.

226
00:09:31,712 --> 00:09:33,372
I mean have all those people to thank,

227
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,645
especially Douglas and Leon

228
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:38,164
for their tracking and persistence.

229
00:09:38,165 --> 00:09:40,525
And Geoffery and his
crew that came out there.

230
00:09:40,528 --> 00:09:43,736
It was just amazing to
see those guys work,

231
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:47,467
and to bring this thing
to a satisfactory end.

232
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:50,051
(upbeat music)

233
00:09:57,444 --> 00:09:59,194
- Geoffrey come here.

234
00:10:01,483 --> 00:10:04,214
Explain something to me.

235
00:10:04,215 --> 00:10:06,195
Kudu eat this.

236
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:07,026
- Yes.

237
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:10,409
- How do they not have
like, how do they eat this?

238
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,095
(laughing)

239
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:13,006
Would eat that?

240
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:13,918
- Hell no.

241
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,506
(laughing)

242
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:19,073
Well first get out, get yourself unstuck.

243
00:10:19,074 --> 00:10:21,590
(laughing)

244
00:10:21,591 --> 00:10:24,011
This is a vachellia tortilis.

245
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:27,629
When they're young like this it just looks

246
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,306
like a big bush, but if you scan over,

247
00:10:29,308 --> 00:10:30,608
if you look at this tree behind us.

248
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:31,452
- Yep.

249
00:10:31,453 --> 00:10:32,797
- That's called an umbrella
tree because you know

250
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:34,222
they come up and they spread open.

251
00:10:34,223 --> 00:10:35,390
That is nasty.

252
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:38,925
I mean it got me right there.

253
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,760
These leaves come off really easy.

254
00:10:43,044 --> 00:10:46,214
So what they do is if you have a look,

255
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,166
when they're really young
they have a lot of these

256
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:51,871
long white thorns to protect
them from over grazing,

257
00:10:51,872 --> 00:10:54,349
so they can reach adulthood.

258
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,192
Yeah so this got softer thorn yet,

259
00:10:56,193 --> 00:10:58,161
so this is new growth.

260
00:10:58,164 --> 00:11:00,244
But over here the thorns are hard already.

261
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:01,987
It's a mature branch.

262
00:11:02,826 --> 00:11:04,746
But if you have a look, all these hooks

263
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:05,967
run in one line.

264
00:11:05,973 --> 00:11:07,731
- [Richard] They're all
pointing back toward the tree.

265
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,288
- And you can take your hand
and actually strip the leaves.

266
00:11:09,289 --> 00:11:12,849
Another really cool part of this location,

267
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:17,103
is these trees, it's amazing
how complex nature is.

268
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:22,113
So in an area where
you have a lot of them,

269
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,756
and they start getting heavily browsed,

270
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,869
they'll actually produce more thorns

271
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,125
of these long white ones
to protect themselves

272
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:31,236
against over grazing.

273
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:33,419
- So that's why some
trees have longer thorns

274
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:34,412
than the other trees.

275
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:35,238
- Exactly.

276
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:36,439
- And then you think it's a different tree

277
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,347
but it's the same tree.

278
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,270
- It's the same tree.

279
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:39,576
And also in maturity,

280
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:42,043
the more mature and
established the root system is

281
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:44,192
the less thorns they need
to protect themselves.

282
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:47,618
Now what's really cool is,
in an area where there's

283
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:50,695
heavy over grazing, not
only the trees that are

284
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:54,420
over grazed themselves will
start producing more thorns,

285
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:57,030
the really neat part is
the whole area's trees

286
00:11:57,031 --> 00:11:58,934
will produce more thorns.

287
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,295
- [Richard] To push the
animals out of there

288
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,313
to some place else to eat.

289
00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:03,991
- Well just to have
them graze, browse this.

290
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:07,533
But who tells the tree
that isn't being browsed

291
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:08,674
to produce more thorns?

292
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:10,100
Aint that cool?

293
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:11,211
- The tree whisperer.

294
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:12,379
(laughing)

295
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:13,384
- The Lorax.

296
00:12:13,385 --> 00:12:15,767
- The Lorax.
(laughing)

297
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,279
Now what about this one though?

298
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,008
- So this is the Acacia
Mellifera, the black thorn.

299
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:23,074
And this is the bane of our lives.

300
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,405
This is a very adult one and you can see

301
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:29,082
it's very established.

302
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:31,585
But this is the one that rips clothes

303
00:12:31,591 --> 00:12:34,241
and just tears everything up.

304
00:12:34,243 --> 00:12:37,449
But once again the leaves
come off very easily,

305
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,880
and all their thorns are
stripped in one direction.

306
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:43,544
- Yeah so you can go this way,

307
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,354
but you can't go that way.

308
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:47,325
- Yeah I wouldn't do
that without a glove on.

309
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:49,167
(laughing)

310
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:51,901
- But how do the kudu,
I know they get thorns

311
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:53,110
and stuff, I've seen them.

312
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:54,434
- So they wrap their tongue around it

313
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:55,867
and strip the leaves, but only

314
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:57,308
in that direction.
- In that direction.

315
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,279
That's cool.

316
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,085
That's really cool.

317
00:13:00,086 --> 00:13:01,776
Can you demonstrate that?

318
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,516
With your tongue?

319
00:13:03,517 --> 00:13:06,097
(upbeat music)

320
00:13:22,071 --> 00:13:24,911
- Straight up Lion King shit right here.

321
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:27,189
I ended up hunting with Thys,

322
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,930
and I first saw Thys
when we got off the plane

323
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,182
at the airport.

324
00:13:31,726 --> 00:13:33,665
He kinda looks like a little boy,

325
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,136
I mean his waist, he's probably
got like a 26 inch waist,

326
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:39,198
he weighs about 97 pounds soaking wet.

327
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,779
(upbeat music)

328
00:13:45,338 --> 00:13:47,975
I tell you what after hunting with him

329
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:49,715
for a very short time,
and shoot by the end

330
00:13:49,716 --> 00:13:51,976
of day number two, we were at some sorta

331
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,518
weird little bromance going on,

332
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,157
and it was just symbiotic.

333
00:13:55,158 --> 00:13:56,318
And I learned later that Richard

334
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:59,235
and Geoffrey had paired everybody up

335
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:00,696
on a personality basis,

336
00:14:00,704 --> 00:14:03,691
of course physical basis Thys
and I were not compatible.

337
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:04,632
Do you got any kids?

338
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:06,956
- I do have a little girl.

339
00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:08,044
Three and half.

340
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:09,605
- What's her name?

341
00:14:09,608 --> 00:14:10,578
- Mira Renee.

342
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:11,877
- Mira Renee.

343
00:14:11,878 --> 00:14:15,087
I bet you're totally whipped aren't ya?

344
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:15,918
Totally.

345
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:16,849
- Totally, totally.

346
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,737
- Yeah.

347
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:19,595
Me too.
- You probably know

348
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:20,590
how it is.

349
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:21,597
- I know exactly how it is,

350
00:14:21,598 --> 00:14:22,635
I've got two girls myself, yeah.

351
00:14:22,636 --> 00:14:23,466
- Yeah.

352
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:24,449
- I always thought I wanted
the boy first actually.

353
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:28,448
Just because girls bring
home a stupid boyfriend

354
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:30,951
or something I could pull out a $50 bill,

355
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:33,616
slide it across the table and say son,

356
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,983
dad's got a little problem
he needs you take care of.

357
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:38,434
But.

358
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:41,615
No it's good I wouldn't change a thing.

359
00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:44,689
- Mine, I'm very surprised.

360
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,514
That she just wants, she keeps telling me

361
00:14:47,515 --> 00:14:50,315
that when she's big, she's
gonna end up hunting with me.

362
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:51,382
For some reason.

363
00:14:51,383 --> 00:14:53,982
She wants to shoot a lipid.
- Aim high.

364
00:14:53,983 --> 00:14:54,981
Yeah, I like that.

365
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:56,816
- And guess where the shot
placement needs to be?

366
00:14:56,817 --> 00:14:57,757
- She knows doesn't she?

367
00:14:57,758 --> 00:14:59,927
- She keeps saying she's going to shoot

368
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:00,759
it in the butt.

369
00:15:00,762 --> 00:15:03,012
(laughing)

370
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:06,891
The other shoulder.

371
00:15:06,893 --> 00:15:08,893
- You've gotta couple of years to work

372
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:09,979
out the details.

373
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:12,574
(upbeat music)

374
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:18,395
So what sparked the interest
to be a professional hunter?

375
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,249
I mean is that, you grew
up you were riding around

376
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,826
with your Red Ryder BB gun and saying

377
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,334
that's what I'm gonna do when I grow up?

378
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:24,604
- No, not at all.

379
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:26,675
No obviously we've always been hunting.

380
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,577
It's, living in South
Africa it's a really,

381
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:31,831
really big hunting culture.

382
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:34,807
Especially for meat.

383
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,729
For every year, you and your father

384
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:40,219
will go out and collect something,

385
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,337
we save for winter, for this year.

386
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:44,268
- Sure.

387
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:47,158
- But no I actually studied architecture.

388
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,229
- No uh.

389
00:15:48,231 --> 00:15:51,084
You're not (laughing).

390
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:54,315
- And around the time I was studying

391
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,320
we bought a game farm and my parents

392
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:02,918
also moved out there from Kimberley.

393
00:16:02,922 --> 00:16:05,698
And, yeah, after that I came back,

394
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,379
my dad was engineer, I helped
him for like a year or two.

395
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,957
And then slowly started
taking clients out,

396
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,185
freelancing, and then
at the end of the day

397
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,016
I just decided the bush is better.

398
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,893
I couldn't take it sitting
in front of the computer

399
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:25,308
every single day.

400
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:27,665
- That makes sense.

401
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:28,888
I don't mean to laugh at ya,

402
00:16:28,893 --> 00:16:30,523
I just think of architects, I just think

403
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:33,450
of refined and proper, that's not you.

404
00:16:33,454 --> 00:16:34,392
- You don't think I'm--

405
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,297
- No this suits you.

406
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:37,893
(upbeat music)

407
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:43,762
What's a group of warthogs called?

408
00:16:43,763 --> 00:16:44,663
A covie.

409
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:46,031
- A what?

410
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:48,141
- A flock of warthogs.
- No, I don't know.

411
00:16:48,142 --> 00:16:49,378
- What do you mean?

412
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,349
Didn't you go to school?
- I didn't learn animals.

413
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:53,530
- [Luke] Clearly they are,
didn't you go to school?

414
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:54,607
- [Thys] Family unit.

415
00:16:54,609 --> 00:16:55,609
- [Luke] That's lame.

416
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,009
- A family of warthogs.

417
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,208
- That's stupid.

418
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,459
Thought you went to school for that shit.

419
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,858
(upbeat music)

420
00:17:03,863 --> 00:17:06,172
One of the things I
appreciate most about hunting

421
00:17:06,173 --> 00:17:08,673
with Thys was just his willingness to stop

422
00:17:08,674 --> 00:17:12,764
and take a break from, you know, stalking,

423
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:14,585
whatever we were hunting at the time.

424
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:17,668
And just experience Africa around us.

425
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:23,697
Hey what's the deal with these hay piles

426
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,326
in the trees anyway?

427
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,847
- This is called a social weavers nest.

428
00:17:27,848 --> 00:17:28,678
- It's a nest?

429
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,041
- It's a nest.

430
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:32,860
- The social weavers build
an apartment complex,

431
00:17:32,861 --> 00:17:34,637
if you will, out of grasses.

432
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,509
I don't even think
there's any mud in there.

433
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,807
- They're this small little weavers.

434
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,410
But they stay together.

435
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:42,990
Almost like an apartment building.

436
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:43,821
Hundreds of them.

437
00:17:43,824 --> 00:17:45,344
If you look underneath.

438
00:17:45,345 --> 00:17:48,946
- I feel, I feel like I
shouldn't have my mouth open.

439
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:51,180
(laughing)

440
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:54,717
- If you look underneath here
you'll see there's holes.

441
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:56,218
- So each one of those
belongs to a little?

442
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:57,051
- Oh yeah.

443
00:17:59,487 --> 00:18:00,497
- Social weavers.

444
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:01,797
- Social weavers.

445
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:02,718
- Those are everywhere,

446
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,510
I just didn't think a whole
lot of it I guess right away.

447
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:06,845
Weird.

448
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:09,335
I have one complaint about Thys,

449
00:18:09,336 --> 00:18:11,036
it was that he was being too picky.

450
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,869
We say what I thought
was a very, very good

451
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:15,287
kudu bull on the first evening.

452
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:17,067
And, you know how guys will often say,

453
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:20,448
don't pass on the first
evening what you would

454
00:18:20,451 --> 00:18:22,355
shoot on the last evening.

455
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:24,464
- That's a bull but he's young.

456
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:27,465
(suspenseful music)

457
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,800
- Is that a good one or not?

458
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:41,732
- [Thys] On the last day maybe.

459
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:44,733
(suspenseful music)

460
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,237
He's nice and wide.

461
00:19:00,962 --> 00:19:02,532
- You're just looking for those tips

462
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:04,162
to come around another couple of inches?

463
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:06,293
- If you look at him from the front,

464
00:19:06,294 --> 00:19:08,367
you want to see his tips.

465
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,938
Those last points are still leaning back,

466
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:19,265
you want them to be upright.

467
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,696
On the last day maybe.

468
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,527
- Copy that.

469
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,010
We say a good kudu bull,
maybe I was a little bit

470
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,690
anxious to get a kudu under my belt.

471
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:33,309
Ended up not, Thys, he
said, maybe on the last day.

472
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:35,750
If you shoot something that first evening

473
00:19:35,751 --> 00:19:37,615
than you're experience is done, right.

474
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:38,599
I wanna keep hunting.

475
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,929
I don't wanna go there and just shoot,

476
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,480
I wanna hunt, I wanna
experience everything

477
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:44,148
between day one and day the end.

478
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,526
- [Thys] He's just missing
that one, too small.

479
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,647
- [Luke] He's not quite there huh?

480
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:56,479
- [Thys] No.

481
00:19:56,482 --> 00:19:58,422
- But it seemed like
everybody else was seeing

482
00:19:58,423 --> 00:20:02,275
kudu bulls or seeing the
type of mature kudu bulls

483
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,770
that we wanted to harvest
and they were everywhere

484
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,318
but where we were at the time.

485
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:08,912
(upbeat music)

486
00:20:22,811 --> 00:20:24,651
- Hopefully then we're gonna give these

487
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:26,454
just a little bit of time.

488
00:20:26,455 --> 00:20:27,285
- Okay.

489
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:28,388
- And just relax.

490
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:30,218
- I noticed that they just took off.

491
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:31,316
- They keep moving.

492
00:20:31,324 --> 00:20:32,274
- Yeah.

493
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:33,555
- Yeah, they're herd animals.

494
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,524
I need to let them settle down.

495
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,395
- Okay.

496
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,934
So we'll be here for a little bit?

497
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:38,765
- Yeah, yeah.

498
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:39,778
Let them settle.

499
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:42,677
And there's lots of time.

500
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:43,508
- Okay.

501
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:45,174
- I don't want to push them too hard.

502
00:20:45,175 --> 00:20:46,708
- That's fine.

503
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,263
So what's your background?

504
00:20:48,264 --> 00:20:49,722
How did you get into this?

505
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:53,125
- I'm actually, when I started working,

506
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,706
I applied for a job
with a diamond company.

507
00:20:57,712 --> 00:20:58,782
- [Alfredo] Diamonds?

508
00:20:58,783 --> 00:21:01,155
- So, you know, for five years

509
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:02,658
I sorted diamonds.

510
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:04,808
- [Alfredo] Oh really.

511
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:08,017
- So I'm actually qualified
diamond evaluator.

512
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:08,848
- [Alfredo] Oh wow.

513
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,191
(laughing)

514
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:11,199
- And now we're hunting.

515
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,260
- [Alfredo] Yeah, so how did
that transition come about?

516
00:21:13,261 --> 00:21:14,889
- It's just a passion I had.

517
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:15,770
- [Alfredo] Oh yeah.

518
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:17,580
- I think I got tired
of the collar and tie.

519
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:18,451
- [Alfredo] Yeah, yeah.

520
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:21,156
- And just one day decided, you know,

521
00:21:21,157 --> 00:21:23,197
it's always been a passion.

522
00:21:23,204 --> 00:21:24,921
- So what's it take to be a

523
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:26,351
professional hunter?
- Professional hunter?

524
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:30,922
In this country it's
pretty much like a course

525
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:32,704
you need to attend.
- Right.

526
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:35,244
- It's normally 10 days to two weeks,

527
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:39,075
very intense, it covers
a wide range of areas,

528
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:44,204
it's not just the hunting,
it's rifle handling,

529
00:21:44,205 --> 00:21:45,955
working with clients.

530
00:21:47,234 --> 00:21:49,904
Able to prepare food, first aid.

531
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:52,142
- [Alfredo] Right.

532
00:21:52,143 --> 00:21:53,695
- [Mark] You know, it's a very wide range.

533
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:56,841
It's a lot of work to cram into two weeks.

534
00:21:56,844 --> 00:21:58,593
- Oh yeah, I noticed your knowledge too,

535
00:21:58,594 --> 00:22:02,252
of plants, trees, all the wildlife here

536
00:22:02,253 --> 00:22:03,953
is really extensive.
- [Mark] It's also

537
00:22:03,954 --> 00:22:05,041
very important.

538
00:22:05,044 --> 00:22:06,852
Cause you know clients
are asking you questions

539
00:22:06,853 --> 00:22:07,813
all the time.
- [Alfredo] Yeah.

540
00:22:07,814 --> 00:22:08,948
- [Mark] And you need to try

541
00:22:08,949 --> 00:22:09,998
and provide them with an answer.

542
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:11,336
- [Alfredo] Yeah.

543
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:13,287
- [Mark] So but I think what makes

544
00:22:13,294 --> 00:22:14,634
a good professional hunter

545
00:22:14,635 --> 00:22:17,471
is experience.
- [Alfredo] Yeah.

546
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:19,053
- It's not something you
can learn out of book.

547
00:22:19,054 --> 00:22:20,044
- [Alfredo] No.

548
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:22,209
- So it comes with experience.

549
00:22:22,212 --> 00:22:24,411
And over the years you sort of develop

550
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:27,602
information, you get information,

551
00:22:27,604 --> 00:22:31,104
and I think what's for me the amazing part

552
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,360
is working with the different people.

553
00:22:35,363 --> 00:22:36,203
- [Alfredo] Yeah.

554
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:39,246
- I have hunted with bus drivers,

555
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:40,691
you name it.

556
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:43,432
And yourself, what type of work do you do?

557
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:47,178
- I'm a photographer and
writer for Guns and Ammo,

558
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:49,916
and other publications that are related

559
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:53,946
to guns and ammo, the
Outdoors Sportsman Group,

560
00:22:53,947 --> 00:22:56,777
they put out over 20 publications.

561
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:01,557
I shoot a lot.

562
00:23:01,562 --> 00:23:04,730
And since I write a lot about rifles,

563
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:06,221
I get to shoot a lot of rifles,

564
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:08,570
and practice at the same time.

565
00:23:08,571 --> 00:23:10,371
- [Mark] Why this rifle,
what made you decide

566
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:11,706
to use this one?

567
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:14,637
- I know a lot of people with
a lot of expensive rifles.

568
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:18,968
And I look at things from
a working person's budget.

569
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:24,666
What can a working person afford.

570
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:28,127
And I really like eking
out the most performance

571
00:23:28,131 --> 00:23:30,631
out of a sub, $1,000.00 rifle.

572
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,997
This rifle was less than $500.00 retail.

573
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:40,805
And I sort of get a kick
out of trying to make them

574
00:23:40,806 --> 00:23:42,486
shoot small groups.

575
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:44,803
And not by modifying them,
but just getting to learn

576
00:23:44,804 --> 00:23:46,270
how they behave.

577
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:48,898
And so I haven't modified this any.

578
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:50,229
And this shoots,

579
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:56,703
an inch or smaller with the right ammo,

580
00:23:57,744 --> 00:24:01,924
I'm running six hour, they're elite ammo,

581
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:05,075
which is a solid copper bullet,

582
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:08,753
and this thing I shot
five, five shot groups

583
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:15,135
and it was .83 inches at a hundred yards.

584
00:24:17,094 --> 00:24:19,050
It's a very accurate rifle.

585
00:24:19,051 --> 00:24:21,051
And it's been very, as you see.

586
00:24:21,054 --> 00:24:22,052
- [Mark] Yeah, it's proved itself.

587
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:22,890
- [Alfredo] Yeah.

588
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:24,355
- [Mark] I like it because
from what I've seen

589
00:24:24,358 --> 00:24:25,908
it's easy to handle.

590
00:24:25,912 --> 00:24:26,752
- [Alfredo] Yeah.

591
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:27,975
- [Mark] And it's lightweight.

592
00:24:27,976 --> 00:24:28,806
- [Alfredo] Yeah.

593
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,078
- [Mark] For those long
distances that we track.

594
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:33,868
- I couldn't ask for
anything more in terms

595
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:35,809
of for the price wise.

596
00:24:35,814 --> 00:24:36,654
- Yeah.

597
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:39,227
(upbeat music)

598
00:24:40,237 --> 00:24:41,977
- [Richard] While on
safari in South Africa

599
00:24:41,978 --> 00:24:44,115
it's near impossible to let the trip go by

600
00:24:44,123 --> 00:24:47,306
without taking in some
of the local culture.

601
00:24:47,307 --> 00:24:49,197
Heck, that's part of the allure.

602
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,550
Whether it's the area's rich history,

603
00:24:51,552 --> 00:24:54,232
the amazing people, or the
picturesque surroundings,

604
00:24:54,233 --> 00:24:56,754
a safari is incomplete without seeing

605
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:59,665
as much as possible of
this remarkable country.

606
00:24:59,673 --> 00:25:01,946
Of course as outdoor journalists,

607
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:04,707
we know that learning as much as possible

608
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:08,841
about our surroundings will
help us best tell the story.

609
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:12,897
- Joe we were just done
recovering your kudu.

610
00:25:12,898 --> 00:25:16,278
And we needed some fuel, so I
brought you to the community

611
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:20,196
and I remember you asking me
why it's called Salt Lake.

612
00:25:20,197 --> 00:25:22,047
- Yeah why is it Salt Lake?

613
00:25:22,051 --> 00:25:24,625
- And I said, hey I'll come show you

614
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:26,026
why this is called Salt Lake.

615
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:29,687
So back in the late
1800s when this area was

616
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:33,526
first settled by the
British, and predominately

617
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,461
the Dougmore family.

618
00:25:35,463 --> 00:25:38,633
They found a large salt deposits here.

619
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:43,760
Animals licking the soil,
and they actually sank water

620
00:25:43,761 --> 00:25:47,287
wells down here for
water for their cattle.

621
00:25:47,288 --> 00:25:49,848
But it was too saline to do anything with.

622
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:53,601
And, you know, over the
centuries people have

623
00:25:54,475 --> 00:25:58,225
mostly used sea water
to evaporation for salt

624
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:02,803
or natural salt deposits, or salt mining.

625
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:07,432
And what they do here is
actual solely evaporation.

626
00:26:07,433 --> 00:26:09,975
So if you have a look over there,

627
00:26:09,976 --> 00:26:12,726
there's these squared pond like things,

628
00:26:12,729 --> 00:26:14,089
and they actually pump the water out

629
00:26:14,092 --> 00:26:17,289
from underground, and pump it in there

630
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,230
and evaporate over a few weeks,

631
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:21,242
and then it crystallizes.

632
00:26:21,243 --> 00:26:22,732
- It's that salty?

633
00:26:22,733 --> 00:26:24,046
- It's that salty.

634
00:26:24,047 --> 00:26:27,717
So the water that's
underneath us right here

635
00:26:27,722 --> 00:26:30,752
actually has between,
depending on rainfall,

636
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:33,593
between a 67 to 85% solidity.

637
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:39,406
And salt starts crystallizing
in the mid to high 90s.

638
00:26:39,408 --> 00:26:42,348
And that just shows
you how difficult it is

639
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:44,193
to make sea salt, because
sea salt's actually

640
00:26:44,194 --> 00:26:47,503
only about 14, 15% depending
on where you are in the world.

641
00:26:47,504 --> 00:26:48,344
- [Joe] Really.

642
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:49,697
And what's this salt used for?

643
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:52,906
- So most of the salt
is used as feed salt.

644
00:26:52,908 --> 00:26:56,598
And the problem with that
and why it is that way,

645
00:26:56,602 --> 00:26:58,549
is this salt is actually very, very health

646
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:01,196
for human consumption,
but because of they open

647
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:03,670
and it's natural and
there's no protection,

648
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:05,791
there's a lot of sand that blows into it,

649
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,099
and actually taints it.

650
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,625
You know if you have a look
it's got a bit of a brown

651
00:27:09,632 --> 00:27:10,674
color to it.

652
00:27:10,675 --> 00:27:13,695
And it can go from almost
pure white to almost

653
00:27:13,703 --> 00:27:18,096
look like sand depending on the
amount of wind there's been,

654
00:27:18,097 --> 00:27:21,627
and how much containments
have blown into it.

655
00:27:21,633 --> 00:27:24,899
But it's very, very
healthy, and what's cool

656
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,420
about this salt as well,
it's not just pure salt,

657
00:27:28,421 --> 00:27:30,821
it's got a lot of added
trace minerals to it

658
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:32,453
that's actually very healthy for us.

659
00:27:32,454 --> 00:27:36,194
- So this has been going on for how long?

660
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:38,525
- So they started in the late 1800s,

661
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:41,699
the Dougmore family and they
were quite a few that did this.

662
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:45,421
And around then there was about
250 people employed there.

663
00:27:45,424 --> 00:27:48,514
And then from about 1950 to mid 1950s

664
00:27:51,273 --> 00:27:54,610
there was about 50 people are employed

665
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:57,211
by the Dougmore family and
all they do is just salt.

666
00:27:57,212 --> 00:28:00,168
And they produce about
5,000 tons of salt per year.

667
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:00,999
- [Joe] Really.

668
00:28:01,002 --> 00:28:02,460
So it's still owned by the Dougmores?

669
00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:04,030
- [Geoffrey] It's still
owned by the Dougmore family.

670
00:28:04,031 --> 00:28:06,447
Same property that we're
hunting on at the moment.

671
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:07,278
- [Joe] Oh really?

672
00:28:07,281 --> 00:28:08,111
- [Geoffrey] Yep.

673
00:28:08,114 --> 00:28:08,952
- [Joe] Oh that's interesting.

674
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:09,777
- [Geoffrey] Yeah my neighbors,

675
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,890
been my neighbors for over 150 years.

676
00:28:10,891 --> 00:28:11,906
(laughing)

677
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,440
- That's pretty interesting.

678
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,779
So then they pile it, they dry it there,

679
00:28:16,784 --> 00:28:18,432
they pile it over here,
they bring it in here,

680
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:19,270
and bag it.

681
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:20,095
- Exactly.

682
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:21,218
So once it starts
crystallizing and they start

683
00:28:21,219 --> 00:28:22,377
scraping it all together,

684
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,669
they got five, 10 loaders and stuff,

685
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,170
and back in the day it used to be done

686
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:28,051
by a shovel and a wheel barrel.

687
00:28:28,052 --> 00:28:30,518
But now it's, you know, a forklift goes,

688
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:33,237
a fronting loader goes and picks it up,

689
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:35,558
and comes and dumps it
in these piles behind us.

690
00:28:35,562 --> 00:28:38,042
And then we actually
caught them in the middle

691
00:28:38,043 --> 00:28:39,768
of the bagging process.

692
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:43,190
They have a bagging machine run by a PTO.

693
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:47,775
And that's actually, the
front end is a crusher

694
00:28:47,776 --> 00:28:49,646
that they can set to how fine you want it,

695
00:28:49,652 --> 00:28:53,031
and then they bag it
with that chute there.

696
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,995
Weigh it and then stitch it.

697
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:59,126
And then yep this goes to our local crops.

698
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:03,458
A lot of it goes to for
water softeners as well.

699
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:04,289
- [Joe] Oh really.

700
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:06,682
- But I tell you about
95% goes to our crops

701
00:29:06,683 --> 00:29:08,066
for feed salt.

702
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:09,897
- That's pretty interesting.

703
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:13,885
And it's, so what's
the origin of the salt.

704
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:17,316
I mean is it, is it prehistoric?

705
00:29:17,317 --> 00:29:19,467
Or is just geology?

706
00:29:19,474 --> 00:29:21,083
- The smart people say this used to form

707
00:29:21,084 --> 00:29:23,295
part of the Indian Sea.

708
00:29:23,296 --> 00:29:24,646
- [Joe] Oh really.

709
00:29:24,652 --> 00:29:25,862
- And that's why that we
have these salt deposits.

710
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:27,969
And like the panru where
we had the shooting range.

711
00:29:27,971 --> 00:29:31,595
That is, if we drove
it, it just as not quite

712
00:29:31,596 --> 00:29:33,856
as saline but very salty.

713
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,399
When you wash your hands with the water

714
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,968
that comes out there it's actually sticky.

715
00:29:36,969 --> 00:29:37,795
- Oh really?

716
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:38,628
- [Geoffrey] Yep.

717
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:40,500
- So you could have a salt operation too.

718
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:43,315
- [Geoffrey] We'll leave
that to my friends.

719
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:44,146
- [Joe] Yeah.

720
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:48,154
- Let's head on back to
camp and go have a whiskey

721
00:29:48,155 --> 00:29:49,215
and celebrate your kudu.

722
00:29:49,218 --> 00:29:50,708
- It's sundown, I could do that.

723
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:53,297
- [Roger] When you head out
into the bush of South Africa,

724
00:29:53,298 --> 00:29:54,815
your mind is focused

725
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:56,738
on the animals you're hunting.

726
00:29:56,739 --> 00:30:00,359
Whether it be a kudu bull,
mountain zebra, gemsbok,

727
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,078
or even dangerous game,

728
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,565
each hunt offers the
potential for a fantastic

729
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:08,976
wild encounter and an everlasting memory.

730
00:30:09,887 --> 00:30:12,184
Failing to take photos or video

731
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:16,355
to help enhance the safari
memories is a mistake.

732
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,966
So to is an African Safari
without taxidermy plants.

733
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:22,968
During this safari we were able to visit

734
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:25,842
and learn from African San Taxidermy.

735
00:30:25,843 --> 00:30:27,973
Which is one of the
largest taxidermy outfits

736
00:30:27,974 --> 00:30:29,426
in the country.

737
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,007
Mounting a kudu is not the same

738
00:30:31,008 --> 00:30:33,076
as mounting a whitetail deer.

739
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:36,035
And the San team knows African game.

740
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:38,206
- So once you have booked
your hunt with your outfitter,

741
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:40,107
we would suggest that you make contact

742
00:30:40,108 --> 00:30:43,426
with a taxidermy in order to
explore all of your options.

743
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:46,067
Also to get the know of all the posts,

744
00:30:46,074 --> 00:30:48,582
and the rules and regulations regarding

745
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,080
the export of your trophies.

746
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,303
It's very important for
the hunter and the PH

747
00:30:52,304 --> 00:30:53,732
to have a great relationship,

748
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:56,259
but it's just as important for the PH,

749
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,916
the hunter, and the taxidermy
to have a great relationship.

750
00:30:59,922 --> 00:31:03,179
In order for everybody to
keep everybody informed

751
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,775
with the new rules and regulations

752
00:31:04,782 --> 00:31:07,951
when it comes to side fees and
the export of your trophies

753
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:09,819
as well as what your options will be,

754
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:11,421
which is very important.

755
00:31:11,422 --> 00:31:12,912
Once you want to do a shoulder mount,

756
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:16,031
you must make sure that
the animal is capped,

757
00:31:16,032 --> 00:31:18,072
if you wanna do a full
mount it's very important

758
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:21,788
that the PH knows the
instructions around that.

759
00:31:21,793 --> 00:31:25,112
Pedestal mounts, everything
gets capped in different ways.

760
00:31:25,113 --> 00:31:26,672
Your different options would be,

761
00:31:26,673 --> 00:31:29,814
going from the least
expensive is your skull mount.

762
00:31:29,815 --> 00:31:31,755
That's just your skull and
horns on a wooden plate.

763
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,870
Then you've got your shoulder mount.

764
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:37,338
Then you've got your wall pedestal mount.

765
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:41,598
You've got a pedestal
box, a floor pedestal box.

766
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,848
Where you have a shoulder
mount on a pedestal box.

767
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:45,687
And then you've got your full mount.

768
00:31:45,694 --> 00:31:47,894
Obviously your most impressive.

769
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:50,805
And will bring your memories back to life.

770
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,668
Everything is based on
what you're looking for,

771
00:31:52,672 --> 00:31:54,866
and depending on your budget.

772
00:31:54,867 --> 00:31:57,957
Once we pick up your
trophies from the farm,

773
00:31:57,964 --> 00:32:00,584
we will be finished with
all of the documentation

774
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,107
from the PH and the outfitter.

775
00:32:03,108 --> 00:32:05,028
We will then bring the trophies here

776
00:32:05,034 --> 00:32:06,914
to African San Taxidermy
where we will tag them

777
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:10,025
and check them into our
storage facility safely.

778
00:32:10,027 --> 00:32:12,487
Once that has been done
we will send you an email

779
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:15,249
to just once again
confirm the instructions.

780
00:32:15,253 --> 00:32:18,373
It's no need to worry as we will apply

781
00:32:18,374 --> 00:32:20,474
for all of the necessary documents

782
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:23,809
to make sure that we export
your trophies safely.

783
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:25,779
However, it is very important to know

784
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,677
and to understand the
rules and the regulations.

785
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:32,136
Okay I think that taxidermy work

786
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:34,175
is very important.

787
00:32:34,176 --> 00:32:36,366
Although photos are great to look at,

788
00:32:36,374 --> 00:32:39,326
nothing keeps your memories alive like

789
00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:40,747
a full mount buffalo.

790
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:43,331
(upbeat music)

791
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:55,060
- Where ya'll been all day?

792
00:32:55,061 --> 00:32:56,286
- I'm really, really glad

793
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:58,427
that everything worked
out the way that it did.

794
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,588
- Fat boy must walk.

795
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:02,086
- You all couldn't even bring us lunch?

796
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:03,767
(laughing)

797
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:05,307
- I walked.

798
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:06,618
- We had a crisp walk today.

799
00:33:06,621 --> 00:33:08,211
I got it done.

800
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:09,828
- What'd you do?
- Remember I was

801
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:11,389
telling you before I said, 99% of the time

802
00:33:11,392 --> 00:33:13,030
I will get it done, but 75% of the time

803
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:14,946
I will screw it up real bad along the way.

804
00:33:14,947 --> 00:33:16,597
(laughing)

805
00:33:16,602 --> 00:33:18,310
- Just like, well I aint gonna say that.

806
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:19,437
Anyway what did ya do?

807
00:33:19,443 --> 00:33:23,316
- I gotta speak more
kindly of Thys tonight

808
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:24,425
then I did last night.

809
00:33:24,426 --> 00:33:25,256
- Oh.

810
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:26,639
- The pressure was on me tonight.

811
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:27,483
- Oh so he did something?

812
00:33:27,484 --> 00:33:28,546
- He did something.

813
00:33:28,553 --> 00:33:30,402
- I finally redeemed.
- He did.

814
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:33,271
Let's just say it's weird
when you gotta herd of 60

815
00:33:33,272 --> 00:33:35,048
gemsbok looking at ya.

816
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,275
It's strange.

817
00:33:36,276 --> 00:33:37,665
- 60?

818
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:39,376
- Yeah probably around there.

819
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:40,581
- Just all lined out the most,

820
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,693
it looked like a puzzle.

821
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:43,188
The most stunning thing, and each one

822
00:33:43,189 --> 00:33:44,339
looks exactly like the next one,

823
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,468
and Thys said the one
on the left is a bull.

824
00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:48,526
And so we were right at 300 yards.

825
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:52,116
And I'm sure I pulled the
shot just a little bit,

826
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:54,927
getting excited, and after the shot

827
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:57,951
I'm like, I don't think
I accounted for the wind

828
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,291
as much as I should of,
and that shot drifted back

829
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:03,239
about a foot, and that
start four and half miles

830
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,146
of hashtag goat rope.
- Oh yeah.

831
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:07,387
Little bit of a rodeo.

832
00:34:07,388 --> 00:34:10,655
- [Thys] There was some tracking involved.

833
00:34:10,656 --> 00:34:11,855
- There was some tracking,

834
00:34:11,856 --> 00:34:14,586
and I gotta, there's so much
to learn from these guys.

835
00:34:14,593 --> 00:34:17,143
I mean think about that,
it's nothing to be proud

836
00:34:17,144 --> 00:34:18,982
of, obviously I wanted
to hanker him right there

837
00:34:18,983 --> 00:34:20,048
and make it quick.
- Yeah.

838
00:34:20,053 --> 00:34:21,512
- That's the end game, that's the goal.

839
00:34:21,513 --> 00:34:23,533
But to be able to stay on that track,

840
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:25,232
and I had the phone in my pocket,

841
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:27,789
four and half miles.
- [Richard] Of tracking?

842
00:34:27,793 --> 00:34:28,731
- Of tracking.

843
00:34:28,732 --> 00:34:29,956
And we could see him occasionally,

844
00:34:29,964 --> 00:34:31,282
he'd be out there, you know, 600 yards.

845
00:34:31,283 --> 00:34:32,122
- Did he separate?

846
00:34:32,123 --> 00:34:33,474
- He separated.
- Yep.

847
00:34:33,475 --> 00:34:34,885
- Then he got with another bull

848
00:34:34,893 --> 00:34:36,471
and they started tussling
around a little bit.

849
00:34:36,472 --> 00:34:37,301
- [Richard] Even after he was shot?

850
00:34:37,304 --> 00:34:38,478
- Yes, after he was shot.

851
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:39,968
And got in with some
bush buck and started,

852
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,949
that like rejuvenated him and he started

853
00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:43,410
running with them.

854
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:44,741
- That herd mentality will do that.

855
00:34:44,744 --> 00:34:45,584
- Yep.

856
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:48,747
- But today we saw the real three range.

857
00:34:48,749 --> 00:34:50,289
- That was awesome.

858
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,960
- That thing was just
walking down the fence line.

859
00:34:52,963 --> 00:34:55,291
At one stage Luke was like,
there he is, there he is.

860
00:34:55,292 --> 00:34:56,448
I said, no it can't be him.

861
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:01,446
Like 50 yards further, hole,
it was him going through there.

862
00:35:01,586 --> 00:35:04,476
- How can a 500 pound animal fit through

863
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,459
a hole that big?

864
00:35:05,463 --> 00:35:07,073
With horns that are 40 inches long

865
00:35:07,074 --> 00:35:08,356
sticking out of his head?

866
00:35:08,357 --> 00:35:09,697
- Somebody shooting at
him that's what it is.

867
00:35:09,704 --> 00:35:11,339
- I was on my belly.

868
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,136
- Somebody shooting at you,

869
00:35:13,137 --> 00:35:14,567
you'd go through a real little hole.

870
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:15,771
(laughing)

871
00:35:15,772 --> 00:35:17,472
- But finally, finally that
that exited the job end.

872
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:20,357
The last shot was 270 yards.

873
00:35:20,364 --> 00:35:21,202
- Yep.

874
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,197
- 270 and he goes
- In the engine box,

875
00:35:22,202 --> 00:35:24,132
perfectly behind the shoulder.
- Light one down.

876
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:25,519
Woof.
- Dropped him.

877
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,902
When you hit him where
you're supposed to hit him,

878
00:35:27,903 --> 00:35:29,023
that shit works real well.

879
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:30,645
- He took like 10 steps.

880
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:32,106
- I started dry heaving it just,

881
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,610
that adrenaline though, you know,

882
00:35:33,613 --> 00:35:35,179
and you get two and half hours,

883
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,765
four and half miles to think about,

884
00:35:36,771 --> 00:35:38,531
I mean you question
everything as a rifleman,

885
00:35:38,532 --> 00:35:40,258
everything great you've ever done,

886
00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:43,146
all the great shots I made
at the range two days ago

887
00:35:43,149 --> 00:35:45,677
hitting an eight inch plate easy

888
00:35:45,678 --> 00:35:48,658
at 300 yards, and I blew it man.

889
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,890
- You tell people to practice
before they come over here,

890
00:35:50,891 --> 00:35:53,656
and they don't know what practice means.

891
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:55,874
They go out for one day and think,

892
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:56,975
hey I can shoot pretty good.

893
00:35:56,984 --> 00:35:59,144
- It's very hard to replicate the emotion

894
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:00,195
that you feel.

895
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:03,656
- And nothing against
Thys or any of the PHs.

896
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:06,149
But you've got a professional that's seen

897
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,920
thousands of people,
they seen more animals

898
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:08,881
killed every year.

899
00:36:08,882 --> 00:36:10,521
You know the whitetail hunters back home

900
00:36:10,524 --> 00:36:12,062
thing they've seen a lot of animals die.

901
00:36:12,063 --> 00:36:12,890
No.

902
00:36:12,893 --> 00:36:14,483
These guys see thousands.

903
00:36:14,484 --> 00:36:16,024
You got this guy looking
over your shoulder,

904
00:36:16,025 --> 00:36:18,082
that's hard to get out of your mind.

905
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:21,100
- At that's, I felt horrible, you know,

906
00:36:21,101 --> 00:36:24,580
take every step, every step,
just guts are all ripped up,

907
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:26,477
but he turned around every now and then,

908
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:27,418
he was like, we're gonna get him.

909
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,394
And when he said it, I believed it.

910
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,225
- Yeah.

911
00:36:30,228 --> 00:36:31,728
- I mean it's like we're gonna get him.

912
00:36:31,729 --> 00:36:34,536
Again, we caught up with
him, and made the shot.

913
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:38,291
- I could not believe
the distance he went.

914
00:36:38,293 --> 00:36:40,096
- It's impressive.

915
00:36:40,097 --> 00:36:44,417
- But more importantly
where we left off last night

916
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:46,488
with the wounded kudu, what happened?

917
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:49,135
(laughing)

918
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:51,939
- That's the bullet that sealed the deal.

919
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,898
- Well done.

920
00:36:52,899 --> 00:36:53,729
Good for you.

921
00:36:53,732 --> 00:36:55,732
- Finally, finally got him.

922
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:59,824
Kinda turned a one day
hunt into a two day rodeo.

923
00:37:00,743 --> 00:37:01,743
- The full experience.

924
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:04,009
- The full African experience.

925
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,912
And we had a little bit
of luck too I would say.

926
00:37:05,913 --> 00:37:06,740
Wouldn't you?

927
00:37:06,743 --> 00:37:07,673
- Yeah, luck for sure.

928
00:37:07,674 --> 00:37:11,666
I think, you know, it's
often when preparation

929
00:37:11,671 --> 00:37:13,571
and everything just comes together.

930
00:37:13,574 --> 00:37:16,904
And often on a hunt when
everything goes smoothly

931
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:19,376
you don't actually learn anything.

932
00:37:19,377 --> 00:37:21,524
- [Luke] That's a great point.

933
00:37:21,525 --> 00:37:23,984
- [Leon] All of us just want
us to end it with one shot.

934
00:37:23,985 --> 00:37:25,905
That's the, aim is everything.

935
00:37:25,906 --> 00:37:28,026
Stalk up on an animal and take it,

936
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:30,402
but often there's some
learning or experience

937
00:37:30,403 --> 00:37:34,527
in making a mistake, and then
going through the problems.

938
00:37:34,528 --> 00:37:36,228
- Yeah that's what I was telling you,

939
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:39,651
at the end of the day, after everything

940
00:37:39,652 --> 00:37:42,682
worked out well, the story behind it

941
00:37:42,683 --> 00:37:44,183
is so much better,

942
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:48,670
and I mean the experience,
we you have that trophy

943
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:52,271
on the wall, you don't just
remember that one perfect shot.

944
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:53,322
- [Luke] You remember the emotion.

945
00:37:53,323 --> 00:37:56,057
- [Thys] You remember the
emotion, the tracking, everything.

946
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,090
The whole experience of it.

947
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,495
- The tracking, I mean
we were going so fast

948
00:37:59,498 --> 00:38:01,528
I had to do the midwest
shuffle just to keep up,

949
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:03,241
and they were on the track,
I mean think about that,

950
00:38:03,242 --> 00:38:04,186
I was power walking--

951
00:38:04,189 --> 00:38:05,559
- [Richard] Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute,

952
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:06,661
can you show us what that looks like?

953
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:07,909
- I'll show you later.

954
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,277
(laughing)

955
00:38:09,278 --> 00:38:11,198
- You're gonna have to do
that dance for us tonight.

956
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,460
- Something we do to keep warm,

957
00:38:12,463 --> 00:38:13,470
remember the power walk.

958
00:38:13,471 --> 00:38:15,476
- But no seriously, I
mean think, we're walking

959
00:38:15,479 --> 00:38:17,437
at like, I don't know,
three miles an hour,

960
00:38:17,438 --> 00:38:18,288
a brisk walk.

961
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:20,075
And they're tracking that fast.

962
00:38:20,081 --> 00:38:22,181
There's tracks going
this way and that way,

963
00:38:22,182 --> 00:38:25,775
and there was a herd
of 60 gemsbok in there,

964
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:26,856
this one.
- [Richard] Yep.

965
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:30,204
- [Luke] Dead nuts confidence, this one.

966
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,639
- Yep and just like with yours,

967
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,385
you see what a well organized outfit

968
00:38:36,386 --> 00:38:38,116
when you get a situation like you had.

969
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:39,037
- Yeah.

970
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,259
- Pull out all the stops.

971
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,087
- [Joe] Yeah boy do I
appreciate that by the way.

972
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:45,355
For bringing out the extra
help, everything like that.

973
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,196
- [Geoffrey] My absolute pleasure.

974
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:47,301
- [Joe] Made me feel
a heck of a lot better

975
00:38:47,302 --> 00:38:49,252
that we're gonna have a
good chance to get this.

976
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:51,195
That's what I asked you this morning,

977
00:38:51,202 --> 00:38:52,432
what do you think our chances were,

978
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:55,888
and you said 70%, and
I said, I'll take 70%.

979
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:58,320
- [Richard] I was thinking like 55.

980
00:38:58,324 --> 00:38:59,544
- But that was after...

981
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,899
- [Geoffrey] Do you no
longer have faith in me?

982
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,065
- [Richard] I'm a pessimist.

983
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:04,179
- Yeah, me too.

984
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,185
I must admit, I told him
after that rain last night

985
00:39:08,186 --> 00:39:10,915
and everything, if you're
going to cut a track again

986
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,186
it's going to be--

987
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,468
- [Richard] But he was still bleeding.

988
00:39:13,469 --> 00:39:14,835
- That's what I said to him this morning.

989
00:39:14,844 --> 00:39:16,574
If there was no rain
yesterday, and it was a

990
00:39:16,575 --> 00:39:18,899
clear blood trail, 95 to 98, maybe 100%,

991
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,938
but after the rain yesterday, you know,

992
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:22,929
it was yeah.

993
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,036
- Yeah that threw this running--

994
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:25,301
- Starting completely over.

995
00:39:25,302 --> 00:39:28,284
- But the big thing is luckily we saw him,

996
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:32,455
by accident, and it led
on to the blood trail.

997
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:33,597
- Yeah, yeah.

998
00:39:33,603 --> 00:39:34,723
- Four and half miles.

999
00:39:34,724 --> 00:39:37,238
(laughing)

1000
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:39,145
- I don't believe in accidents.

1001
00:39:39,146 --> 00:39:39,976
- Showoffs.

1002
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:41,839
- Accidents are unintentional occurrences.

1003
00:39:41,843 --> 00:39:42,982
- But actually I was--

1004
00:39:42,983 --> 00:39:44,349
- If you hadn't been there,

1005
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,635
you wouldn't of seen him.

1006
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:46,716
- I was thinking about that too,

1007
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,775
because actually we
were putting a stalking

1008
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:52,836
on the bull that Geoffrey had seen,

1009
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:55,041
and it was further beyond,
and we didn't really

1010
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:58,505
think it could be him, but you could see

1011
00:39:58,506 --> 00:40:00,246
his horns shining in the sun,

1012
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,490
so we had to go check him out
to basically eliminate it.

1013
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:04,617
- [Richard] Yep.

1014
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:06,458
- So that, that wasn't him,

1015
00:40:06,462 --> 00:40:08,862
and we're climbing and
kinda the same thing,

1016
00:40:08,863 --> 00:40:11,412
mountain goat doing his
kind of stuff all his life,

1017
00:40:11,413 --> 00:40:14,411
and as I'm huffing and
puffing, and it's like

1018
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,962
man we're really gonna
go up there that fast,

1019
00:40:15,963 --> 00:40:18,780
and jump in these rocks,
rocks, rocks, rocks,

1020
00:40:18,781 --> 00:40:20,357
and so then we eliminate that one,

1021
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:23,486
he says we'll runs off,
you know, no limping,

1022
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,997
no anything, it's like
well that's not him.

1023
00:40:26,002 --> 00:40:28,351
So then when we head back we go up on top

1024
00:40:28,352 --> 00:40:31,722
of the copie, and basically
we're coming back,

1025
00:40:31,724 --> 00:40:33,914
and you know we gotta
basically start over.

1026
00:40:33,915 --> 00:40:37,911
And we actually just
bumped him out of a canyon.

1027
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:42,953
And when he runs off, then these guys say

1028
00:40:42,954 --> 00:40:45,464
oh he's limping, and I
go these guys are just.

1029
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:47,157
(laughing)

1030
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:48,600
Yeah trying to make me--

1031
00:40:48,601 --> 00:40:49,979
- They're just trying to
make you walk more, right?

1032
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:50,827
- Yeah exactly.

1033
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:52,177
Now they want me to walk up that?

1034
00:40:52,178 --> 00:40:53,525
(laughing)

1035
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:54,906
And so we go down to where he was,

1036
00:40:54,907 --> 00:40:58,025
and there was blood, and I go (chuckles)

1037
00:40:58,026 --> 00:41:00,095
and then I knew we'll get him,

1038
00:41:00,096 --> 00:41:01,676
cause I know how good these guys are,

1039
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:03,929
these trackers are, that
if they've got fresh blood,

1040
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,925
if it doesn't rain, you know, clear skies,

1041
00:41:06,927 --> 00:41:10,447
and I knew that I'm not leaving the track.

1042
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:13,478
And I know they won't,
so, we're gonna get him

1043
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,019
no matter how long it takes.

1044
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,060
- Well done guys.

1045
00:41:16,063 --> 00:41:17,313
So all in all--

1046
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,130
- Good day.

1047
00:41:19,133 --> 00:41:19,971
- Finally.

1048
00:41:19,972 --> 00:41:20,796
- Hey.

1049
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:21,629
- Hey.

1050
00:41:21,632 --> 00:41:22,470
- What's happening.

1051
00:41:22,471 --> 00:41:23,525
- You always get in
for the camera or what?

1052
00:41:23,528 --> 00:41:24,358
- Late as usual.

1053
00:41:24,361 --> 00:41:25,711
- It's a hell of a drive for a milkshake.

1054
00:41:25,712 --> 00:41:27,060
(laughing)

1055
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:27,982
- Told you.

1056
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:31,449
- How's it going?

1057
00:41:31,453 --> 00:41:32,541
Sorry we're late.

1058
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:33,658
- What have you been doing?

1059
00:41:33,662 --> 00:41:34,542
- Duty calls.

1060
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:37,493
- Yeah we've been getting stuff down.

1061
00:41:37,494 --> 00:41:39,251
- We have not seen you all day.

1062
00:41:39,252 --> 00:41:41,378
No morning report, no evening report.

1063
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,360
- We made the most of our daylight.

1064
00:41:43,364 --> 00:41:45,703
- We had an incredible day.

1065
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:46,574
- Really?

1066
00:41:46,575 --> 00:41:50,247
- Just say no, you're so secretive,

1067
00:41:50,254 --> 00:41:53,790
no one listens, no anything,
you're always arrive late.

1068
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:54,661
- Won't answer the radio.

1069
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:55,763
- Won't answer the radio.

1070
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:57,428
We don't have no news.

1071
00:41:57,429 --> 00:41:58,859
(laughing)

1072
00:41:58,861 --> 00:41:59,729
- Just turn it off.

1073
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:00,559
- That's right.

1074
00:42:00,562 --> 00:42:01,532
No interference.

1075
00:42:01,534 --> 00:42:03,644
(laughing)

1076
00:42:03,645 --> 00:42:05,085
We had an awesome day.

1077
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:06,787
- Yeah, we were chasing this territorial

1078
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:11,210
blackbuck, and we come across
these warthogs running,

1079
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,590
and Mark goes, see that one in the front,

1080
00:42:18,814 --> 00:42:21,524
there's something wrong
with her, take her out.

1081
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:25,096
I get on my sticks,
like a turret, meet it,

1082
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:29,342
boom, it hits the ground, comes back up,

1083
00:42:30,765 --> 00:42:32,095
and runs straight towards us.

1084
00:42:32,097 --> 00:42:33,087
(laughing)

1085
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:33,934
- [Thys] Charging!

1086
00:42:33,935 --> 00:42:35,107
(laughing)

1087
00:42:35,111 --> 00:42:37,771
- Chamber, boom hit it
again, it keeps coming,

1088
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:39,648
boom, hit again, boom.

1089
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:42,177
(laughing)

1090
00:42:42,178 --> 00:42:43,968
- I couldn't figure out
what was wrong with it.

1091
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:46,325
The whole back side of the
warthog was covered in blood.

1092
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,000
- Really?
- Really?

1093
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:49,200
- Yeah, just a young sow.

1094
00:42:49,201 --> 00:42:50,751
But there were three of them,

1095
00:42:50,754 --> 00:42:51,831
and she was leading them.

1096
00:42:51,832 --> 00:42:53,238
- [Leon] That's very odd.

1097
00:42:53,243 --> 00:42:54,473
- So I just made a call and said--

1098
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:55,878
- No good call to make.

1099
00:42:55,882 --> 00:42:58,801
- Yeah something was
wrong with her for sure.

1100
00:42:58,802 --> 00:43:00,935
So you got charged by a warthog?

1101
00:43:00,936 --> 00:43:01,926
- Yes.
- I've never seen anyone.

1102
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:03,304
- I feel like you were buffalo hunting.

1103
00:43:03,305 --> 00:43:04,508
- Oh it was so awesome.

1104
00:43:04,514 --> 00:43:05,940
I felt like I was in a video game.

1105
00:43:05,941 --> 00:43:07,436
(laughing)
It was so neat.

1106
00:43:07,443 --> 00:43:08,740
- Was he screaming?

1107
00:43:08,741 --> 00:43:11,631
- It was, you know, it's
the stuff that you practice,

1108
00:43:11,634 --> 00:43:16,224
stuff like one of my shooting
instructors is Jim Cober,

1109
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,910
from the sites in Illinois,
and the last class

1110
00:43:22,004 --> 00:43:24,274
I had with him we were practicing movers.

1111
00:43:24,275 --> 00:43:26,023
So I just boom, boom.

1112
00:43:28,807 --> 00:43:31,217
It was neat that it paid off.

1113
00:43:32,117 --> 00:43:33,177
- [Richard] Yep.
- Yeah.

1114
00:43:33,181 --> 00:43:34,641
- And you just mentioned
before they arrived,

1115
00:43:34,642 --> 00:43:35,852
practice.
- Practice.

1116
00:43:35,854 --> 00:43:36,863
Yeah.

1117
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,908
Apparently he practiced
more than Luke did.

1118
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,319
(laughing)

1119
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:43,650
- Do you wanna eat my
gemsbok or do you wanna

1120
00:43:43,651 --> 00:43:44,521
eat his warthog?

1121
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:46,260
(laughing)

1122
00:43:46,263 --> 00:43:48,063
- Hang on now, hang on now.

1123
00:43:48,064 --> 00:43:50,276
Steak or sausage?

1124
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:52,049
(laughing)

1125
00:43:52,051 --> 00:43:53,804
And that sorta clean kill.

1126
00:43:53,805 --> 00:43:56,064
(laughing)

1127
00:43:56,065 --> 00:43:58,975
- We're going to get him his boots.

1128
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:02,936
- We're driving along afterwards,

1129
00:44:02,937 --> 00:44:07,326
we come in to a trackers
going back to his truck

1130
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:08,737
for your gemsbok.

1131
00:44:10,605 --> 00:44:12,345
- [Thys] Oh yeah Paul City.

1132
00:44:12,354 --> 00:44:13,274
- Yeah.

1133
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,735
So we gave him a ride to his truck.

1134
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:17,416
Which put us on a detour.

1135
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:20,077
And as we're coming back the sun's already

1136
00:44:20,084 --> 00:44:22,564
behind the mountain, and
I'm just enjoying the view

1137
00:44:22,565 --> 00:44:25,312
up top with George, the tracker,

1138
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:27,881
and so I'm just enjoying
it, and I'm thinking

1139
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:29,987
there's nothing gonna go
on, and all the sudden

1140
00:44:29,988 --> 00:44:31,768
Mark stops the truck.

1141
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,618
"Hey, hey, there's a buck over there,

1142
00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:37,689
shoot him, shoot him."

1143
00:44:37,693 --> 00:44:41,804
And the funny thing is,
at that exact same time,

1144
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:45,845
George is on my right, the
buck is on my right as well.

1145
00:44:45,854 --> 00:44:46,694
- The buck?

1146
00:44:46,695 --> 00:44:47,885
What are we talking about?

1147
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:48,716
- A kudu.

1148
00:44:49,681 --> 00:44:50,511
- Oh!

1149
00:44:50,514 --> 00:44:51,650
Well done.

1150
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:55,481
- So at that exact same
time the walkie talkie

1151
00:44:58,049 --> 00:44:59,049
starts going off.

1152
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:01,317
(laughing)

1153
00:45:01,321 --> 00:45:02,411
- And it's me and you.

1154
00:45:02,412 --> 00:45:04,437
(laughing)

1155
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,490
- Yeah we were talking at sunset.

1156
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:10,815
- And it was on the inside
jacket of George's shirt,

1157
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:15,880
inside jacket then he had
another jacket on top,

1158
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,361
so he's trying to figure out which pocket.

1159
00:45:17,362 --> 00:45:19,075
(laughing)

1160
00:45:19,076 --> 00:45:21,546
I grabbed the rifle and
he finally finds it,

1161
00:45:21,547 --> 00:45:25,127
and then he steps aside,
and I just post up

1162
00:45:26,216 --> 00:45:29,626
onto the bar, the upper bar on the truck.

1163
00:45:31,524 --> 00:45:35,864
- And I grabbed the Sig
Sauer and I go 141, confirm.

1164
00:45:37,202 --> 00:45:38,765
And it's quiet.

1165
00:45:38,766 --> 00:45:40,576
(laughing)

1166
00:45:40,579 --> 00:45:42,038
- Shoot him!

1167
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,459
- Yeah so I get on there
get a good beat on it, boom,

1168
00:45:48,355 --> 00:45:50,605
and it just goes like this,

1169
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:54,851
and it stumbles, and it
just walks a little bit

1170
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:57,997
more forward, I follow it, and Mark goes

1171
00:45:57,998 --> 00:46:01,668
shoot it again, I see
exactly where it's at,

1172
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,818
get a clear shot again,
boom, and he just goes down.

1173
00:46:05,819 --> 00:46:07,446
- Just for reassurance.
- Well done.

1174
00:46:07,448 --> 00:46:09,478
- But assurance.
- [Luke] So that's

1175
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:10,609
how you do it.
- [Mark] Yeah.

1176
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,476
Two bullets a scene like this.

1177
00:46:11,479 --> 00:46:12,309
- [Alfredo] Yeah.

1178
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:13,390
- [Joe] That's how you do
it, it doesn't take two days.

1179
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:14,215
- [Alfredo] No.

1180
00:46:14,218 --> 00:46:15,048
(laughing)

1181
00:46:15,051 --> 00:46:15,881
- [Alfredo] You found yours?

1182
00:46:15,884 --> 00:46:16,722
- [Joe] We got him.

1183
00:46:16,723 --> 00:46:17,777
- Oh that's, congratulations.

1184
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:18,788
- Same to you.
- [Thys] Well done guys.

1185
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:19,739
- Yeah.

1186
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,829
- Congratulations.

1187
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:23,577
- So that was my, that's
why we're arriving late,

1188
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:24,971
of course I have to do my photo shoot

1189
00:46:24,972 --> 00:46:26,285
with my lights and all this stuff.

1190
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:29,037
And it's already dark, so
then that's why I explained

1191
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,740
that I carry all this gear.

1192
00:46:31,742 --> 00:46:33,245
(laughing)

1193
00:46:33,246 --> 00:46:36,316
- [Geoffrey] Now I can
leave the bag behind.

1194
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,229
- So now let me get this straight.

1195
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,876
So you shot the warthog this morning.

1196
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:40,329
- I shot it in the afternoon.

1197
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:41,595
Like an hour before.

1198
00:46:41,596 --> 00:46:42,766
- Oh so you hunted all morning,

1199
00:46:42,771 --> 00:46:44,548
and then went to Kimberley to the spur,

1200
00:46:44,549 --> 00:46:45,915
got the motel, and then come back?

1201
00:46:45,921 --> 00:46:46,891
(laughing)

1202
00:46:46,892 --> 00:46:48,281
- [Alfredo] Yeah, yeah, I
came back, yeah exactly.

1203
00:46:48,282 --> 00:46:49,362
- Okay I'm just making sure.

1204
00:46:49,363 --> 00:46:51,616
- I was squeezing a siesta as well.

1205
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:52,838
- [Richard] A siesta?

1206
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,080
(laughing)

1207
00:46:54,081 --> 00:46:56,420
- Yeah so I had a fantastic day here

1208
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:58,326
at Fort Richmond Safaris, thank you.

1209
00:46:58,327 --> 00:46:59,227
- [Geoffrey] My pleasure.

1210
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,071
That you.

1211
00:47:00,072 --> 00:47:00,896
- Everybody did.

1212
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:02,829
- Outstanding PH, outstanding tracker,

1213
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:05,157
I can't ask for anything better.

1214
00:47:05,158 --> 00:47:06,158
- Thank you.

1215
00:47:07,293 --> 00:47:08,901
- I've never seen someone so excited

1216
00:47:08,902 --> 00:47:10,299
to shoot a running pig.

1217
00:47:10,301 --> 00:47:11,131
- Really?

1218
00:47:11,134 --> 00:47:12,635
(laughing)

1219
00:47:12,636 --> 00:47:13,996
- Well we just said it was a good day,

1220
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,448
I didn't expect it to get this good.

1221
00:47:16,451 --> 00:47:19,031
- Kudu, warthog, kudu, warthog.

1222
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:22,000
- Gemsbok.

1223
00:47:22,003 --> 00:47:24,533
- All free range in one day.

1224
00:47:24,534 --> 00:47:25,374
- Yep, absolutely.

1225
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,366
- Not just any kudu, the kudu.

1226
00:47:28,367 --> 00:47:29,197
- The kudu.

1227
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,270
- Yeah that's amazing.

1228
00:47:30,272 --> 00:47:33,004
- That's a big deal to get that kudu,

1229
00:47:33,005 --> 00:47:35,135
and you'll find him.

1230
00:47:35,139 --> 00:47:37,219
I will sleep much better tonight.

1231
00:47:37,223 --> 00:47:38,609
- Well cheers everybody

1232
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:40,305
to a great day of hunting.
(guys talking)

1233
00:47:40,312 --> 00:47:41,702
- It was a great day.

1234
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:44,280
(upbeat music)

1235
00:47:49,301 --> 00:47:51,721
(soft music)

1236
00:48:02,294 --> 00:48:04,249
- [Man] That fucking bull.

1237
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,120
- Well it's a zebra.

1238
00:48:06,122 --> 00:48:07,560
(laughing)

1239
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:09,231
- What is happening?

1240
00:48:12,468 --> 00:48:15,138
(African music)

1241
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:17,584
- One of the largest misconceptions

1242
00:49:17,585 --> 00:49:19,285
of hunting in Africa is that you need

1243
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:21,880
a big custom rifle, or
a big, large caliber

1244
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:23,360
an expensive custom gun.

1245
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:26,098
This offering from
Mossberg, Patriots Revere,

1246
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,410
is the perfect African Safari rifle.

1247
00:49:28,411 --> 00:49:31,937
Inexpensive, but still has
the plastic safari look

1248
00:49:31,942 --> 00:49:33,409
with this beautiful wood stock.

1249
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,775
So when you need an African Safari rifle,

1250
00:49:35,782 --> 00:49:37,729
you don't need thousands of dollars,

1251
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:39,164
you need hundreds of dollars.

1252
00:49:39,165 --> 00:49:43,035
Mossberg, this perfect
African Safari rifle.

1253
00:49:43,037 --> 00:49:45,697
(African music)

1254
00:49:47,476 --> 00:49:50,326
(gun shots)

1255
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:53,003
(African music)

1256
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,210
- Hi I'm Richard Mann and
this is a SureFire light,

1257
00:50:42,212 --> 00:50:43,980
now the thing about hunting is

1258
00:50:43,981 --> 00:50:46,698
some people hunt at
dark but 90% of hunting

1259
00:50:46,703 --> 00:50:48,599
occurs during daylight hours, however,

1260
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,245
that hunting that occurs
during daylight hours

1261
00:50:51,247 --> 00:50:53,817
starts before daylight and typically ends

1262
00:50:53,824 --> 00:50:56,113
after daylight, that means if you're gonna

1263
00:50:56,114 --> 00:50:58,151
be a hunter and you're
serious about success,

1264
00:50:58,152 --> 00:51:00,245
you gotta have a flashlight.

1265
00:51:00,254 --> 00:51:03,148
And nobody makes better
flashlights than SureFire.

1266
00:51:03,149 --> 00:51:05,099
And there's three things
to think about when you're

1267
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:07,004
buying a light, especially for hunting,

1268
00:51:07,005 --> 00:51:09,578
one, is LED, you want LED bulbs

1269
00:51:10,928 --> 00:51:14,308
cause they last longer
and they're more durable.

1270
00:51:14,314 --> 00:51:16,084
Two, you want lithium batteries.

1271
00:51:16,085 --> 00:51:19,282
Same thing, they last longer
and they're more durable.

1272
00:51:19,283 --> 00:51:21,500
And lumens, you need to have a specific

1273
00:51:21,502 --> 00:51:22,649
amount of lumens.

1274
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,290
As you can see, this
SureFire has two levels.

1275
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:28,329
One this is great for moving around camp,

1276
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,090
and not stumbling over your own feet,

1277
00:51:30,091 --> 00:51:31,807
but this is good for seeing stuff.

1278
00:51:31,809 --> 00:51:33,889
So think about the amount of lumens

1279
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,835
you need for light, and check this out.

1280
00:51:36,836 --> 00:51:39,405
This little SureFire here is rechargeable,

1281
00:51:39,406 --> 00:51:41,736
what's really cool about it,

1282
00:51:42,871 --> 00:51:44,911
put it right on your hat, eating dinner

1283
00:51:44,912 --> 00:51:47,312
around the campfire, using
both hands to skin an animal,

1284
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:49,777
this light has you covered.

1285
00:51:49,778 --> 00:51:51,968
So, if you're a hunter, you need a light,

1286
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,470
and it needs to be a SureFire.
