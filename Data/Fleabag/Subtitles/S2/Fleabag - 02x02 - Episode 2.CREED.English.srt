1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,790
Here's to love!

2
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:04,112
Congratulations, you assholes!

3
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:06,021
Did you always want to join
the priesthood?

4
00:00:06,046 --> 00:00:07,530
Oh, fuck no.

5
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:08,890
Are you a real priest?

6
00:00:08,891 --> 00:00:10,170
Yeah.

7
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:12,957
So, do your family
get together much or...

8
00:00:13,011 --> 00:00:14,610
Well, fuck you then.

9
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:16,700
And do you want to know what gift
I'm giving your father?

10
00:00:16,724 --> 00:00:18,183
- Oh, God.
- It's a portrait.

11
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,778
- Oh, God.
- Of you girls.

12
00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:21,942
- Oh, God.
- You pissed off or you doing a poo?

13
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:24,210
Get your hands off my miscarriage!

14
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:25,541
- What's happened?
- Nothing's happened.

15
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:27,502
- Just had a little...
- What? What, darling?

16
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:29,211
- Miscarriage.
- Hospital now.

17
00:00:29,236 --> 00:00:30,580
What about the bill? Sit down.

18
00:00:30,605 --> 00:00:31,634
I'll cover her. I'll cover you.

19
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:34,050
If you ever need someone. I'll be there.

20
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:35,815
If it didn't want to be in there,
it didn't want to be in there.

21
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,354
Something wasn't right.

22
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:40,730
What the fuck!?

23
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,588
- The priest is quite hot.
- So hot.

24
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,170
Peace be with you.
Yeah, you too, thank you.

25
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:52,810
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

26
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:54,850
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

27
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:55,930
Peace be with you.

28
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:56,970
Peace be with you.

29
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:58,890
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

30
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:00,810
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

31
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:01,851
Let us pray.

32
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:14,530
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

33
00:01:14,531 --> 00:01:20,210
thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven.

34
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:25,010
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,

35
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:29,010
as we forgive those who
trespass against us

36
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:32,730
and lead us not into temptation,

37
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:34,451
but deliver us from evil.

38
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,398
Amen.

40
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:46,770
♪ Rooted, grafted, built on thee ♪

41
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,290
Please be seated.

42
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,555
And also with you.

43
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:01,651
Um... Sorry, uh, yes, today's...

44
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:06,250
Um... Today's notices.

45
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:11,691
There's a raffle at tomorrow's
fete to raise funds for the...

46
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:16,050
Sorry... The diocesan
pilgrimage to Lourdes.

47
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:19,450
Uh, congratulations to
St Ethelred's Football Club.

48
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:21,010
Woo!

49
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:22,330
Three one victory.

50
00:02:22,331 --> 00:02:24,690
Uh, next Friday is a first Friday
and I'm going to be

51
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:28,890
making my usual sick calls to the
housebound with the Eucharist

52
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:32,810
and, finally, on Thursday I'm going
to begin Holy Communion

53
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:35,650
preparation classes and there are
more details of that

54
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:38,970
in the parish newsletter,
along with my latest review.

55
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:41,850
That's all, folks.

56
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,931
Uh, please stand for God's blessing.

57
00:02:44,676 --> 00:02:46,089
Thanks so much.

58
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:47,706
- Thank you, Father.
- All the best. See you next week.

59
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:48,739
All the best.

60
00:02:48,764 --> 00:02:50,930
- Really good one, Father.
- Nice to see you, Gina.

61
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:52,730
Loved the story about your eye.

62
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:55,850
Off you go.
Give my regards to those budgies.

63
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:00,050
- Hello.
- Hi.

64
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:02,650
- This is lovely.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

65
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:04,170
I thought you'd be in prison by now.

66
00:03:04,171 --> 00:03:07,490
Ah, well, I keep trying,
but they just won't have me.

67
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:09,490
- I'm sorry about your eye.
- Oh, that's okay.

68
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:10,930
Gives me some edge.

69
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,850
I've told them some heroic bullshit.

70
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:13,970
Um... Bless you, Sandy.

71
00:03:13,971 --> 00:03:15,012
- Thank you, Father.
- Bless you.

72
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:16,129
Thank you, Father.

73
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:17,770
- Thank you.
- Bye.

74
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,450
- Bye now. Have a nice day.
- God bless you.

75
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:21,595
- Bye. See you next week.
- Bless you.

76
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:24,538
I just wanted to pay
you back for dinner...

77
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,694
- Oh, no! Thank you, honestly.
- Because I... No, no, really, I insist.

78
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,554
- It'll have to be in instalments...
- I don't want it. I don't want it.

79
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,218
- I've got no pockets.
- Please...

80
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:32,196
Honestly, thank you. Nah-ah!

81
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:35,016
I'm going to knife the candles, Father.
They're a bit clogged up.

82
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:37,090
- Okay, Pam.
- Yeah.

83
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:39,007
Well, the hair dryer's in the,
in the wonky drawer...

84
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:41,490
Under the wonky drawer. Yes, I know.

85
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:42,890
- Hello, love.
- Hi.

86
00:03:42,891 --> 00:03:45,569
Oh, is that for the collection?
How sweet. So kind.

87
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:46,691
Thank you.

88
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:49,308
That's Pam.

89
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:54,301
Do you like tea?

90
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,125
Jesus.

91
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:14,211
- Tea!
- Great.

92
00:04:16,371 --> 00:04:18,425
I don't want boast, but I make
a cracking...

93
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,570
- Oh! Bastard! Sorry.
- Oh!

94
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:22,047
- Bastard!
- Um...

95
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:24,071
Let me just get this.

96
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:26,830
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, is that holy?

97
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:29,634
A bit less than it was before.

98
00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:31,720
Shit. Uh... Oh, well.

99
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:35,533
He'll understand.
He's an understanding sort.

100
00:04:35,557 --> 00:04:36,814
Okay.

101
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:40,611
There you go.

102
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,119
Sorry about all the tat.

103
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:45,970
It's for a fundraiser garden
party thing tomorrow.

104
00:04:45,995 --> 00:04:47,850
So much stuff, absolutely no staff.

105
00:04:47,851 --> 00:04:50,570
- You can volunteer if you want.
- Oh...

106
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:52,650
- I'm only joking.
- Oh.

107
00:04:52,651 --> 00:04:55,330
You've probably got a life.

108
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:56,650
- What's the time?
- Um...

109
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,530
Do you want a proper drink?
I've got cans of G&T.

110
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,170
From M&S.

111
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:03,050
- Well, it's...
- I will if you will.

112
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:04,840
Okay.

113
00:05:04,865 --> 00:05:06,371
Okay.

114
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:16,171
Thanks.

115
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:23,079
So, you're a cool priest, are you?

116
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:24,375
- A cool priest?
- Yeah.

117
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,900
No. I'm a big reader with no friends.

118
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:27,010
Are you a cool person?

119
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:29,170
- I'm a pretty normal person.
- A normal person?

120
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:30,776
- Yeah, a normal person.
- What makes you a normal person?

121
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:33,171
Well, I don't believe in God...

122
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,383
I love it when He does that.

123
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,959
So, you were in my prayers last night.

124
00:05:48,998 --> 00:05:50,474
Likewise.

125
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:52,930
I'm sorry for your loss.

126
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:54,610
What?

127
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:55,891
Your baby.

128
00:05:57,331 --> 00:05:59,550
Oh! Yeah, thank you.

129
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:02,571
Thank you. Yes, I...

130
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:05,630
Thank you.

131
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:07,414
Is the father all right?

132
00:06:07,515 --> 00:06:09,779
Well, he doesn't really...

133
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:13,091
...exist.

134
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:16,171
I understand.

135
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:21,224
The funeral liturgy says

136
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:25,044
that life is changed, not ended.

137
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:29,930
I've always loved that,
if that's of any help.

138
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,227
Oh, well, thank you very much,
but I really am an atheist.

139
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,050
Yeah, I gathered
that by the smelling of the Bible.

140
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,436
New sermon?

141
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:42,881
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's... I write, uh...

142
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,051
...restaurant reviews
for the parish magazine

143
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:46,795
and I was just finishing
up the last one.

144
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,387
I actually just came up with
a really good title.

145
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:49,651
Ah, what is it?

146
00:06:50,491 --> 00:06:51,841
- No.
- What?

147
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:54,090
- No, it's not cool.
- Well, neither are we, so...

148
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:56,778
"I'd spend 40 days and 40
nights in that dessert."

149
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:02,457
Oh, God, I fancy a priest.

150
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,451
There you go.

151
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:46,844
Hey.

152
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:48,850
Are you having an event?

153
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:50,210
No.

154
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:51,890
Why are there so many people here?

155
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:54,050
Well, it's just successful, I guess.

156
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:56,354
Why is everyone talking to each other?

157
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,698
Oh, it's Chatty Wednesday.

158
00:07:57,723 --> 00:07:58,874
If you buy something,
you have to have a chat

159
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:00,706
- with someone you don't know.
- What?

160
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,610
Loneliness pays.

161
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:04,930
Listen, can we...

162
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:05,971
Sure.

163
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:12,650
- I know you and I haven't...
- Have you had a check-up?

164
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:15,130
Yes, it's fine.
It's really not a big deal.

165
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:16,641
- It happens all the time...
- Hello!

166
00:08:16,665 --> 00:08:18,130
- No.
- Where you from?

167
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,040
I'm not... This isn't...
I'm not part of this.

168
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:23,412
I shouldn't have to...
I don't want to tell you that.

169
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:25,365
No. Sorry. No.

170
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,608
Tooting.

171
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,838
She hasn't bought anything yet, Joe.

172
00:08:29,863 --> 00:08:32,863
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

173
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,866
Does Martin know?

174
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,835
You're not supposed to tell anyone
for the first 12...

175
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,085
- Well, you can tell the father.
- I just haven't told him.

176
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,258
- Okay, but what does he know?
- I don't want to talk about it, okay?

177
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:43,617
And I never want anyone
to know about it.

178
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:44,774
You have it.

179
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,625
You're better at dealing with
awful things anyway.

180
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:48,020
- I don't want it.
- Well, you took it,

181
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:50,288
now everyone thinks
you have it, so you have it.

182
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:59,101
What?

183
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:00,699
They're some pretty funky trainers.

184
00:09:00,724 --> 00:09:02,215
I said I'm fine.

185
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:03,940
I just really, really don't want
anyone to make

186
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:05,533
a big deal out of this, okay?

187
00:09:05,558 --> 00:09:08,117
Brutal. Just brutal.

188
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:09,797
You must feel rotten.

189
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:11,357
Do you feel rotten?

190
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:13,507
I'd rather not talk about it if
that's okay.

191
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:15,557
Of course, darling. Come on up.

192
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:17,437
Claire get the door, for God's sake.

193
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:19,227
Did you know who the father was?

194
00:09:19,252 --> 00:09:21,407
Um, you know, I'd rather not
talk about it if that's okay.

195
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:23,501
No, of course, darling.

196
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:26,351
I've got a set up I'm very
excited about.

197
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,095
- It's going to be very striking.
- Cool.

198
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:30,455
So, Claire, if you just sit here.

199
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:31,564
That's lovely

200
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:34,341
And, darling, just beside her like that.

201
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,906
Lovely.

202
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,935
Actually, if you could just...

203
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:39,711
That's it, that's it.

204
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:41,096
Just a bit.

205
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:44,311
Bit more.

206
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:45,711
There, perfect.

207
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:46,992
Gorgeous, yes.

208
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,191
Sorry, no, if you could just...

209
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,192
That's it. Thank you, darling.

210
00:09:55,232 --> 00:09:57,511
- So, um...
- She can't not talk about it.

211
00:09:57,512 --> 00:09:59,591
- You know, I have six friends...
- A lie.

212
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:01,951
...who've had miscarriages.

213
00:10:01,952 --> 00:10:05,231
Five of them never managed to
produce a child afterwards,

214
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:07,465
but the sixth one did
and rather regretted it,

215
00:10:07,527 --> 00:10:10,363
so I think you've probably done
the right thing.

216
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:11,632
Thank you.

217
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,026
Did you never want them?

218
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:16,691
Oh, I'm still thinking about it.

219
00:10:17,872 --> 00:10:19,791
Is Dad here? I texted him, but...

220
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,591
- Oh, I saw that.
- Oh, so he is here?

221
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:23,952
Sorry, no, I've got his phone today.

222
00:10:25,952 --> 00:10:27,631
I love that colour.

223
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:28,671
Which one?

224
00:10:28,672 --> 00:10:31,649
- That one.
- Oh, that's three colours.

225
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,968
Right. I'm getting rid of it.

226
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,991
But it was quite an adventure painting.

227
00:10:35,992 --> 00:10:37,911
I had an orgasm as I finished it.

228
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:40,353
Well, let's hope we all get as much
pleasure out of this one.

229
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:41,720
No, no. Could you...?

230
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,467
Um, I have a pretty full
afternoon, so...

231
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:46,202
Oh, have you got to go back
to Finland again?

232
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:47,866
No, Finland are coming here.

233
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,471
Oh. Well, that's easier for you.

234
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:50,631
Mmm.

235
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:52,238
Are you still okay to pick up
the invitations?

236
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:53,871
Oh, yes, of course.

237
00:10:53,872 --> 00:10:55,464
And did you find that ribbon
thing for the flowers?

238
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,951
- Yes.
- Great.

239
00:10:56,952 --> 00:10:58,456
And is Martin's nose on the mend?

240
00:10:58,481 --> 00:10:59,549
Yes.

241
00:10:59,574 --> 00:11:01,363
And how's the bassoon solo coming on?

242
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:02,950
Oh, yes, he's practising.

243
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:05,269
- Oh, God, and now I just have to...
- What?

244
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:06,693
Sorry, Claire, can you look up, please?

245
00:11:06,718 --> 00:11:07,725
Thank you.

246
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,151
Organise canapes for an awards ceremony.

247
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:11,991
Oh, gosh, you must be exhausted.

248
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:13,813
Does the little cafe do canapes?

249
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:15,618
It totally could, yeah.

250
00:11:15,643 --> 00:11:18,162
Well, there you are.
That's one off the list.

251
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:19,227
Great.

252
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:26,475
Gosh, haven't you got a lovely,
thick neck?

253
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:30,111
- That was fun.
- Thank you.

254
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:31,933
I really can help with
the canapes if it's...

255
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,283
- I'm going to say this quickly. Okay?
- Okay.

256
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:36,471
Martin wants to press
charges against you for assault.

257
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:38,566
I've tried to talk him down, but to
be fair, you did hit him

258
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:40,032
- fucking hard.
- What?!

259
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,496
I will provide you with exceptional
legal advice as long as

260
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:44,776
you don't tell anyone I'm providing
you with exceptional legal advice.

261
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,636
- What?!
- This is happening.

262
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:49,540
I am mortified, but it is happening, okay?

263
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:51,511
I will hire this lawyer to scare him off

264
00:11:51,512 --> 00:11:54,282
and I will hire you to do the canapes.

265
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:55,871
- Who's the lawyer?
- Oh, he's a friend.

266
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:57,751
He mainly defends rapists.

267
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:58,933
He has a high success rate then.

268
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,597
Undefeated. Come on.

269
00:12:01,712 --> 00:12:03,831
I've filled him in with the basics.

270
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:06,196
- That your husband's an animal?
- Be serious.

271
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,967
Just do whatever he says
and don't flirt with him.

272
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:11,996
I'm not going to f...

273
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:14,231
Fucking hell, okay.

274
00:12:14,232 --> 00:12:15,991
- Claire!
- David, thank you so much...

275
00:12:15,992 --> 00:12:17,551
- Oh! Sorry.
- Wow.

276
00:12:17,552 --> 00:12:19,071
I can take you to court for that.

277
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:21,802
This the little trouble maker, then?

278
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,151
- Hi.
- Hi.

279
00:12:23,152 --> 00:12:26,576
Now, listen, I just want to be
clear that whatever happens,

280
00:12:26,601 --> 00:12:29,334
I don't sleep with people
I work with, okay?

281
00:12:32,963 --> 00:12:34,836
I'm joking.

282
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:36,687
Slip on in, ladies.

283
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:39,844
Well, if you spit guilty, you'll
have to swallow a short jail term,

284
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:41,359
or community service if you're lucky.

285
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:42,413
Or?

286
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:43,861
- You definitely started it?
- Yes.

287
00:12:43,886 --> 00:12:46,674
- Any witnesses?
- About 30.

288
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,697
The most important thing, honey,

289
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:52,115
is that you do not, under any
circumstances, apologise.

290
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,310
- I can do that...
- No, that's not what we discussed.

291
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:57,111
Well, that can be taken
as an admission of guilt.

292
00:12:57,112 --> 00:12:59,071
I assume you know the victim personally?

293
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:01,104
- Yes...
- No, and let's not call him

294
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:03,391
- the victim yet, shall we?
- Well, that's what he is.

295
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:05,191
Yes. Right.

296
00:13:05,192 --> 00:13:06,591
They've definitely fucked.

297
00:13:06,592 --> 00:13:08,351
We just want a letter to scare him off

298
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:09,951
if he ends up seeking proper action.

299
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:12,068
- Really doesn't make sense, Claire.
- Actually maybe not.

300
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:13,623
I think it makes perfect sense.

301
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:15,740
- I just want to be ahead of the game.
- God, I can't tell.

302
00:13:15,765 --> 00:13:18,248
- That's a habit of yours, I've heard.
- Oh, I've got it.

303
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:19,499
- Is it?
- They haven't...

304
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:20,999
You're going to have to tell me
who said that.

305
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,482
- Never.
- ...but they're going to.

306
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:24,296
- David.
- Oh, God, I've got to get out.

307
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:25,887
- Claire.
- Excuse me.

308
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:26,884
Where you off to, little lady?

309
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:30,134
I'm just going to let this... Yeah.

310
00:13:46,768 --> 00:13:48,087
You all right?

311
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:50,180
Yeah. Just thought I'd leave you to it.

312
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:52,887
- Sorry.
- What?

313
00:13:52,888 --> 00:13:55,000
He says he'll only talk you through
potential proceedings

314
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:56,633
- if you go for a drink with him.
- What?

315
00:13:56,657 --> 00:13:58,183
- I know.
- Outrageous.

316
00:13:58,208 --> 00:13:59,927
- Stop smiling.
- I thought he was after you?

317
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:02,662
So did I, but my hair isn't great at
the moment.

318
00:14:02,687 --> 00:14:04,567
Either way, it's very inappropriate.

319
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:05,954
- Don't sleep with him.
- I won't.

320
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,212
- Don't.
- I won't.

321
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:08,344
I don't do that anymore.

322
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,687
What? Why? Are you ill?

323
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:12,167
- No.
- Then what?

324
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:14,603
Well, I just...

325
00:14:14,628 --> 00:14:16,251
Oh, my God. Have you met someone?

326
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:18,607
Well, not really.

327
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,207
- Back with Harry?
- No, it's actually...

328
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,315
- Someone new?
- Well...

329
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,488
- Is he single?
- Sort of.

330
00:14:25,328 --> 00:14:26,847
Take this.

331
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:29,253
I'll try talk Martin down,
but call him if you need him.

332
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:31,127
He's a very good lawyer.

333
00:14:31,128 --> 00:14:33,247
Surprisingly...

334
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:35,584
...tender underneath it all.

335
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,100
Knew it.

336
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:39,381
What you did in the restaurant
was unforgiveable.

337
00:14:39,405 --> 00:14:41,405
I know.

338
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,688
Thank you.

339
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:46,231
Okay, well...

340
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:49,090
Listen, I actually just wanted to
give you... this.

341
00:14:49,115 --> 00:14:51,467
It's just one session, but you've
been through a lot, so I just...

342
00:14:51,492 --> 00:14:53,288
Oh, my God, I said I'm fine.

343
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:55,928
I'm weirdly fine.

344
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,248
I'd rather have the money.

345
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:18,145
Excuse me, I've got dry forearms.

346
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,161
Sure.

347
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:24,367
So, why have you come to the session?

348
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:26,452
Oh, it was a birthday
present from my father.

349
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:28,927
Is that a joke?

350
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,288
No.

351
00:15:32,008 --> 00:15:33,927
It would be good not to make
jokes in here.

352
00:15:33,928 --> 00:15:39,024
Just in case anything gets
lost in humorous translation.

353
00:15:39,048 --> 00:15:41,168
Oh, I don't know if I can do that.

354
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,967
Is that a joke?

355
00:15:43,968 --> 00:15:45,008
No.

356
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:50,170
Oh, just try not to, or make
it very obvious.

357
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:52,367
Sure.

358
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,303
So, why do you think your father
suggested you come for counselling?

359
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:58,109
I think because my mother died
and he can't talk about it

360
00:15:58,134 --> 00:16:00,290
and my sister and I didn't speak for
a year because she thinks

361
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:02,243
I tried to sleep with her husband
and because I spent most

362
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:05,001
of my adult life using sex to
deflect from the screaming void

363
00:16:05,026 --> 00:16:07,623
inside my empty heart. I'm good at this.

364
00:16:07,648 --> 00:16:09,551
Although I don't really
do that any more.

365
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:12,223
You close with your family?

366
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:15,687
We get on with it.

367
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:18,047
- Do you talk?
- God no!

368
00:16:18,048 --> 00:16:20,007
Any friends?

369
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,248
- Sorry?
- Any friends?

370
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:25,687
Um...

371
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:27,661
No, I don't really have time for...

372
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:30,567
Well, I have a guinea pig,
but she blows hot and cold.

373
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:31,802
Not a joke.

374
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:35,407
Tell me about the sex.

375
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:39,407
All of it?

376
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:41,167
You said you don't do that now.

377
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,875
Oh, no, I just play tennis now.

378
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,291
Tough crowd.

379
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:48,908
Sorry.

380
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:50,877
I just...

381
00:16:51,008 --> 00:16:53,744
Sex didn't bring anything...

382
00:16:53,848 --> 00:16:56,056
good, so I'm trying not to...

383
00:16:57,602 --> 00:16:59,001
But I've...

384
00:16:59,072 --> 00:17:01,143
And what have you found
in your abstinence?

385
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:04,088
Well, I'm very horny and
your little scarf isn't helping.

386
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,775
So, the impulse is still there?

387
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:10,603
Oh...

388
00:17:10,672 --> 00:17:13,861
Yeah, the impulse is...

389
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:16,739
The impulse is very much still there.

390
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:18,942
It's just never the right person.

391
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:20,447
Mm.

392
00:17:20,505 --> 00:17:23,239
So there is a particular person
you're not having sex with?

393
00:17:23,288 --> 00:17:24,786
No!

394
00:17:24,848 --> 00:17:27,767
Well, look, nothing's happened.
I just...

395
00:17:27,768 --> 00:17:29,567
He's not available.

396
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:31,807
- In a relationship?
- Yes, a bad one.

397
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:33,487
Oh, really? How so?

398
00:17:33,488 --> 00:17:35,286
It's a sort of relationship
where one partner

399
00:17:35,311 --> 00:17:37,875
- tells the other how to dress.
- Are you in love with him?

400
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,802
No!

401
00:17:39,827 --> 00:17:42,047
Why do you find that funny?

402
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:43,767
Well, I...

403
00:17:43,768 --> 00:17:45,687
I dunno, I just...

404
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:47,927
I don't... No!

405
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:50,177
- Just not a romantic?
- No.

406
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,487
Just...

407
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:54,709
a girl with no friends
and an empty heart?

408
00:17:58,248 --> 00:17:59,728
By your own description.

409
00:18:05,648 --> 00:18:06,927
I have friends.

410
00:18:06,928 --> 00:18:08,848
Oh, so you do have someone to talk to.

411
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:12,008
Yeah.

412
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,567
Do you see them a lot?

413
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:17,885
Oh, they're... they're always there.

414
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,596
They're...

415
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:21,441
They're always there.

416
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:23,386
Why do you find that funny?

417
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,885
Listen, I don't need to be analysed.

418
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,199
I have a nice life. I just...

419
00:18:26,223 --> 00:18:28,223
I just wanted to exchange
the voucher for the money.

420
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:30,127
It's a bit late for that now.

421
00:18:30,128 --> 00:18:31,848
I've only been here five minutes.

422
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,362
I want the money.

423
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:40,784
I want to fuck a priest.

424
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:42,567
- Catholic?
- Yes!

425
00:18:42,568 --> 00:18:44,247
- A good one?
- Yes!

426
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,182
- Looks good in the...
- Mmm, yes.

427
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:47,994
I understand.

428
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:50,487
Do you really want to fuck the priest,

429
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:52,727
or do you want to fuck God?

430
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:55,527
- Can you fuck God?
- Oh, yes.

431
00:18:55,528 --> 00:18:58,915
Look just please tell me
how to not fuck a priest,

432
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,579
before I get arrested.

433
00:19:00,604 --> 00:19:03,032
Well, I don't think fucking a priest
will make you feel as powerful

434
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:05,807
- as you think it will.
- Can you just tell me what to do?

435
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:07,055
You know.

436
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:11,327
You already know what you're
going to do. Everybody does.

437
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:12,607
What?!

438
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:15,070
You've already decided
what you're going to do.

439
00:19:15,848 --> 00:19:18,087
So what's the point in you?

440
00:19:19,768 --> 00:19:21,288
You know what you're going to do.

441
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:24,527
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

442
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:25,906
- I don't!
- You do!

443
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,059
- I don't! I don't...
- You do!

444
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:30,674
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

445
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:32,181
Shut up.

446
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,127
Hi, can I have two
raffle tickets, please?

447
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:37,516
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, hi!

448
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,327
Hi! You're...

449
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:40,390
- Yeah!
- ...with child.

450
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:41,357
- Yes.
- Cool!

451
00:19:41,382 --> 00:19:42,866
- You, you got a fringe!
- Yeah!

452
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,943
Yeah. Oh, cool.

453
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:46,820
- Aw, you always wanted a baby!
- You always wanted a fringe.

454
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:48,776
She is amazing.

455
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:51,297
- I mean, it's been tough, but amazing.
- Oh, yeah?

456
00:19:51,322 --> 00:19:53,340
Yeah, I mean, the birth
really took its toll.

457
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:55,483
- Oh, really? Was it a tricky one?
- I can't really remember it now.

458
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:58,920
But the whole thing has
just really changed me.

459
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:00,580
I just don't feel...

460
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:02,279
You know, my emotions are up and down.

461
00:20:02,303 --> 00:20:04,916
My body just feels different.

462
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:08,101
I mean, Elaine is being amazing,
so supportive...

463
00:20:08,126 --> 00:20:09,777
It sounds like you have got
post-natal depression.

464
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:12,230
I do, yeah, but we're
working through it.

465
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:15,361
- Sure.
- Just to let you know,

466
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:17,129
the band is going to start
in a couple of minutes.

467
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:18,860
Hey, Father. This is Suzie!

468
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:21,220
Aw, I don't know how
to talk to babies, sorry.

469
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,860
Do you guys know each other?

470
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:24,501
- Uh, yeah.
- We sort of used to...

471
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,594
I used to be her girlfriend.

472
00:20:26,621 --> 00:20:27,981
Oh, cool.

473
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:31,061
Good for you!

474
00:20:31,101 --> 00:20:32,902
I'm going to go
and show her the coconuts.

475
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,576
- She's really good at counting.
- Okay.

476
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:37,500
Excuse me, everyone!

477
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:41,340
The Youthy Band is about to
play the ode to something!

478
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:43,160
- You having fun?
- Yes, yeah.

479
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:44,589
- Selling well? Good.
- Yes, I think so.

480
00:20:44,614 --> 00:20:45,988
Oh, puzzle. I love a puzzle!

481
00:20:46,013 --> 00:20:47,950
- The Youthy Band are about...
- Yes, I heard you, Pam.

482
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:50,161
Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you.

483
00:20:52,261 --> 00:20:54,525
- Ah, there's the main event.
- Yeah!

484
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,454
- Very talented.
- She, uh, she...

485
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,709
Don't say it. She, she, actually...

486
00:20:59,734 --> 00:21:00,818
Just don't say it.

487
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,100
She actually orgasmed
when she finished it.

488
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:04,300
I just said it.

489
00:21:04,325 --> 00:21:06,045
- Apparently.
- Ah!

490
00:21:08,373 --> 00:21:10,213
Well, whatever gets you there!

491
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:16,270
Father! Father, we have
a cupcake situation over here!

492
00:21:16,295 --> 00:21:18,180
Okay, Pam! I will be there to cupcake.

493
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:21,421
Thank you so much for helping.

494
00:21:26,849 --> 00:21:28,649
Arm touch.

495
00:21:35,221 --> 00:21:38,940
At least my son is in the
Youthy Band, what's your excuse?

496
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:40,900
Urgh!

497
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:43,020
I'm helping the priest.

498
00:21:43,021 --> 00:21:46,100
Wow, you do love a challenge, don't you?

499
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,029
Hey, I just want to say something...

500
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,820
It's from River Island.
I got it last week.

501
00:21:49,845 --> 00:21:54,340
No. I want to say that I'm sorry
for saying what I said.

502
00:21:54,341 --> 00:21:56,700
I'm sorry for what you went through.

503
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:58,249
I'm sorry.

504
00:21:58,273 --> 00:21:59,980
I know what you're doing.
I'm not going to say it.

505
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm just saying sorry.

506
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:02,780
I'm not going to say it.

507
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:04,500
I'm sorry.

508
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:05,661
Mm-mm.

509
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,511
Okay.

510
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,020
And thank you.

511
00:22:12,021 --> 00:22:14,060
- She and I have never been better.
- Oh!

512
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:16,100
You had a big part in that.

513
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:18,100
I'm happy for you.

514
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:21,132
I'm happy you've found a way
to deflect from your pitiful,

515
00:22:21,157 --> 00:22:24,257
self-sabotaging, ego-driven,
masturbatory...

516
00:22:24,282 --> 00:22:26,180
I cannot believe how well
this is coming out.

517
00:22:26,205 --> 00:22:28,620
...pawing, insidious, insidious,

518
00:22:28,621 --> 00:22:30,421
overwhelming mediocrity,

519
00:22:30,446 --> 00:22:32,853
only to finally figure out
that at your very core,

520
00:22:32,877 --> 00:22:36,174
you are a weaky.

521
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:38,220
Damn!

522
00:22:38,221 --> 00:22:40,580
- A "weaky"?
- Damn! Damn!

523
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:42,609
Wow. A "weaky"?

524
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:51,780
In that case, I just wanted you to know

525
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:55,320
that I'm impressed with
how you just keep bouncing back.

526
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,140
I really am.

527
00:22:57,141 --> 00:23:00,052
You're a strongy.

528
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,863
That was awesome, man.

529
00:23:02,888 --> 00:23:04,540
Creepy Jake, mainly says things like...

530
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:05,940
- Where's Claire?
- ...and...

531
00:23:05,941 --> 00:23:07,020
Where's Claire?

532
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:08,540
She couldn't make it, man.

533
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:11,603
Lucky for us, your aunt
is an avid church goer.

534
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:13,020
Hi. Thanks for watching.

535
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:15,476
Oh, you were excellent.

536
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:17,140
- Oh!
- Ooh.

537
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:18,660
Careful there, buddy.

538
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:20,986
You could go down for that
sort of behaviour these days.

539
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:23,308
- It was just a hug.
- "Oh, it was just a hug!"

540
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,222
You got to do better
than that these days, boy.

541
00:23:25,247 --> 00:23:27,636
- Specially round this firecracker.
- But I didn't do...

542
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,128
Come on.

543
00:23:30,021 --> 00:23:32,037
I don't want to be an asshole.

544
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:33,980
I just want her to be happy.

545
00:23:33,981 --> 00:23:37,647
And she has been really happy...

546
00:23:37,701 --> 00:23:39,491
...until she saw you.

547
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:42,137
Just saying.

548
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,541
Wow.

549
00:23:54,701 --> 00:23:56,154
Psst.

550
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:58,060
Hi, Jake. Ooh.

551
00:23:58,085 --> 00:24:01,396
Tell her to leave him.

552
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:03,100
What?

553
00:24:03,101 --> 00:24:07,266
Tell her to leave him.

554
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,981
He's going to kill someone one day.

555
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:23,754
- Hey!
- Yes, Father?

556
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:24,822
Yes, Father?

557
00:24:24,847 --> 00:24:26,604
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

558
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:27,707
Oh, God.

559
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:30,660
Can I get that coconut back?
They're actually on hire.

560
00:24:30,661 --> 00:24:32,980
I'm not sure if a lot of them
are even real, actually,

561
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:36,004
which is morally a bit dubious,
but we've got to make money somehow.

562
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:38,860
- Thank you.
- Knuckle brush.

563
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:41,656
Also, I hope you don't mind, but, um...

564
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:44,526
I've marked a few pages in here
that I thought might be...

565
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,119
Ooh, eh.

566
00:24:46,144 --> 00:24:48,264
No, no, no, no. I'm not trying to...

567
00:24:49,741 --> 00:24:51,210
They're just words.

568
00:24:51,261 --> 00:24:55,260
Okay, it's just I...
I think I know what happens.

569
00:24:55,301 --> 00:24:56,541
Classic.

570
00:24:58,141 --> 00:24:59,461
Come on, have a read.

571
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:03,845
I'd like to know what do you think.

572
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,957
And if you ever want to...

573
00:25:06,027 --> 00:25:08,098
talk about stuff, I'm here.

574
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:10,145
With a G&T, of course.

575
00:25:11,515 --> 00:25:13,155
You can come whenever you want.

576
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:16,652
I'd like you to come,

577
00:25:16,735 --> 00:25:18,255
if it helps.
