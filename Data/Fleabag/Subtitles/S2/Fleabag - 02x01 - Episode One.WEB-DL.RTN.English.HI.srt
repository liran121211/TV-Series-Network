00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,040
This programme contains strong
language and adult humour.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,960
I opened a cafe with my friend, Boo.
Yeah, she's dead now.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,640
Thank you for coming in today.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,840
That kind of thing won't get
you very far here any more.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,120
Oh! Argh!

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,800
I suppose you should meet Hillary.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,000
She's beautiful!

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,960
Mum died three years ago.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,400
Loo, doo, ooh, badoo!

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,840
All right, Dad?

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,320
Dad's way of coping with two
motherless daughters was to buy us

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,640
tickets to feminist lectures,
start fucking our godmother,

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,840
and eventually stop calling.
Did you take the sculpture?

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,920
What sculpture?

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,600
Martin's being lovely.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,600
I am not drunk. Always drunk.

17
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,400
Jake's her step-son. He's really
weird, probably clinically,

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,200
but no-one really talks about that.

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,360
No. I got the Finland promotion.
That's amazing! Thank you.<

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,760
People make mistakes.

21
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,560
Your husband tried to kiss
me on your birthday.

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,840
I'm just going to say this once.

23
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,320
He didn't try to kiss you.

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,160
He says it was more like the other
way around. Believe me!</f

25
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,840
How can I believe you?
Because I'm your sister!

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,480
After what you did to Boo?

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,800
I'm sorry. I think you should go.

No, thank you.

Love. Hey!

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,880
Urgh.

Congratulations, you assholes!

And that's it. Oh, darling!

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,880
Congratulations, Dad.
Congratulations! Cheers.

78
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,960
May these be the worst of our days.

79
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't know who this guy is.
Happy for you, old boy.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,120
Best decision a man can make.

81
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,600
Urgh.

82
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,360
You look well. Thank you.

83
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,880
Right. Wine, everyone?

84
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,400
I'd love some wine.
Oh, you'll adore it. I chose it.

85
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
Not for us, thanks.

86
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,480
Off the sauce!
Six months and counting.

87
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Why would you do that? We just...

THEY LAUGH

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,240
I haven't seen her since...

91
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,240
Except for...

92
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,200
Nice jumpsuit. Thank you.

93
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,960
You look well, where've you been?
Boots.

94
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,080
It's lovely there this time of year.

95
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,760
Oh, you look fantastic.

96
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,760
Oh, well, you both look gorgeous!

97
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,920
Oh, thank you. Is that fur?

98
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,560
Yes, but it's OK
because it had a stroke.

99
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh, lovely!
LAUGHTER

100
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,640
I can't go to hell for
that, can I, Father?

101
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,640
No. Not as long as you confess.
Oh, God, he's their priest.

102
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,400
Then you've nothing to fucking worry
about! Their cool, swea

103
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,720
Love the Catholics! You can get away
with anything. A lot of

LAUGHTER

105
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
It's an honour to be marrying
you two. Thank you.

106
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,800
I didn't realise you were allowed
out without your little doggy thing.

107
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,080
Oh, sorry, have I disappointed you?

108
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,120
Of course not. Devastated.

109
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,720
Can I get you another bottle?

110
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,520
Needy waitress. Ah, no, it's all
right. We've already order

111
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,120
Oh, no, really?

112
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,760
I'll have another tequila.
I'll have a tequila.

113
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,120
Great, thank you so much.

114
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,200
Can I get a glass of sparkling water
with a dash of lime, please?

115
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,440
Oh, yes, I'll have the same.

116
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,680
Dream team.

117
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,720
THEY CHUCKLE SMUGLY

118
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,560
You know the most fascinating
thing about Father here,

119
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,880
is that his mother was
originally a lesbi...!

120
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,200
SHE SIGHS

121
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,680
You do look tired.

122
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,120
Oh, it's not as exhausting as I
thought it would be, actually.

123
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,640
She's commuting from Finland.

124
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,800
She has narrowed down her packing
to a ten-minute turnaround.

125
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,240
It's... Fabulous! It's all about...

126
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,400
Rolling it up, rather than...
Folding it.

127
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,640
I read about that. Now, are you sure
you don't want any wine?

128
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,520
Oh, no, thank you!
It really is delicious.

129
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,160
I admire you both so much.

130
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,360
Well, it's really turned us around,
hasn't it, honey?

131
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,680
Oh, so much more energy.
You know, in Finland...

132
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,240
Is there a reason that you're not
drinking? He's an alcohol

133
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,680
Oh, fun, my parents are alcoholics.
Oh, great.

134
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,680
We thought it'd be easier
if we did it together,

135
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,800
and I don't really like the taste...
And we are trying for a baby!

136
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,040
Oh, Claire!

137
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,960
We thought you couldn't have them!
What? Why?

138
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,360
Well, you just seem a little...

139
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,800
Well, they say a lifestyle change
can help, so here we go.

140
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,920
That is so exciting, darling.
Thanks, Dad.

141
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,680
Good luck. That's wonderful.

142
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,720
Something's up. And now you have the
money to pay for proper

143
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,280
Ghastly without help, I imagine.

144
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,800
Tell us about Finland.

145
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,480
Oh, well, it's, um...

146
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,160
..cold and beautiful and dark.

147
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,520
I think she might be happy.

148
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,240
It's a lot of pressure, but I love
it. I have this amazing new partner

149
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,280
out there, he's really pushed the
company forward...

150
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,200
I can't remember the last time we
went away.

151
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,560
Weren't you both in Japan recently?

152
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,920
Japan, wow. Oh, yes, but that was
just a little fortnight.</f

153
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,800
Don't ask her!
Why were you in Japan?

154
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Well, the... I was...
Oh, sorry, darling.

155
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,080
Oh, no, no. Thank you.

156
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,560
They flew us over
with the Sexhibition.

157
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
HE INTERRUPTS
Sorry, darling, do you want to...?

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,320
No, no, no. No? Oh.

159
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,120
You see, you think of the Japanese
as a very prudish people.

160
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
Not to generalise.

161
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,320
But actually they have a very deep
interest in sex in their culture,

162
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,680
it's just hidden in the underbelly.

163
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,880
It's not allowed to come to the
surface. Fair enough.

164
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,880
TALKING OVER EACH OTHER: They really...
The honesty of the</f

165
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,600
The Americans, oh, well... Well,
they just took me in their s

166
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,080
But the Japanese were deeply moved
by my work, I think.

167
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,120
Weren't they, darling? Yeah.
It caused quite a cultural wave

168
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,440
A ripple.

169
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,120
Wave.

170
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,000
No-one's asked me a question
in 45 minutes. So what do you d

171
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,280
Er, I run a cafe.

172
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,880
Oh, wow.

173
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,400
It's going well, is it?

174
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,480
Yes, it is. It really is.

175
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,720
It actually is.

176
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,440
It is.

177
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,240
HE LAUGHS

178
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,080
Can I get anyone any ice?

179
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,320
Fellow smoker.
Do you have a spare one? Sure.

180
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,280
So, do your family get
together much, or...?

181
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,240
Fuck you, then.

182
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,080
We should wait.

183
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,440
OK.

184
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,920
He's such a lovely man. Yes.
THEY TALK OVER EACH OTHER</font

185
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,760
Did you have a cigarette? Yeah.

186
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,280
I just, I wish you
could've seen him in...

187
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,800
You know, they can't even
masturbate!

188
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,960
Shit alive, man. Oh, sorry.

189
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,560
We were just saying, it's
fascinating,

190
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,200
the notion of a calling.

191
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,840
Yeah, well, marriage
is a calling, too, of course.

192
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,800
Did you always want to join the
priesthood? Oh, fuck, no.</fo

193
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,880
THEY LAUGH

194
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,640
Sorry.

195
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,480
No, no, no. I came quite late to it,
actually, but it's been a really

196
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,400
good life to me.

197
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,200
I've really found peace in it.

198
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
Is anyone in your family
in the Church?

199
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,200
Actually, both my parents
are lawyers and my brother

200
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,880
is a long-distance lorry driver.
How unusual!

201
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,360
Are your parents successful?

202
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,320
They were very successful
alcoholics, yeah.

203
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,920
THEY LAUGH

204
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,680
Better than you, anyway.

205
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,840
No, but beyond them,
my family's literally crawling

206
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,400
with nuns, so it wasn't
too much of a leap.

207
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,760
Must be hard on the balls.

208
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,360
LAUGHTER Martin!

209
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,760
Not as hard on them as trying to
make a baby for five months,

210
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,560
I imagine. Food good?

211
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,600
This sauce is disgusting.

212
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,400
Is everything OK?
Oh, it's delicious, thank you.

213
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,200
Delicious. Lovely, lovely.

214
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
Um, darling...

215
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,280
No, no. We'll just pour our
own wine, please.

216
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,400
Oh, I actually love doing...
Thank you.

217
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,200
You can pour me some. Oh, thank you.

218
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,600
So, do you do a lot
of older weddings?

219
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,960
I don't think that's how we...

220
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,680
No, this is my first-ever wedding,
actually.

221
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
ALL: Oh!

222
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,880
Do you know, I've always
been so suspicious of religion,

223
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,040
but I must say, I think there's
something rather chic

224
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
about having a real
priest at a wedding.

225
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,080
HE CHUCKLES

226
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,560
Are you a real priest?

227
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,760
Yeah.

228
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,040
Do you know, it's so nice spending
time getting to know the man

229
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,880
who's going to marry us.
Is that usual?

230
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,920
No, but I'm new to the parish,
and I guess I'm just...

231
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,240
HE LAUGHS

232
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,960
I'm really fucking lonely!

233
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,280
LAUGHTER

234
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,000
So I appreciate this.
Thank you very much.

235
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,440
New to the parish?

236
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,120
Father Patrick sadly died,
so I got the gig.

237
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,480
What did he die of?

238
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,600
Just, um, time.

239
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,640
But he was a dedicated man,
he was a brilliant priest.

240
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,400
Sounds like a riot.

241
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
He was, actually.

242
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,080
Do you know how we met?

243
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,360
No. Through Jake.

244
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,680
Creepy step-son.
He plays the flute...

245
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,520
ALL: The bassoon.
..in the church band. Just adorable!

246
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,720
And Claire introduced us
and we just hit it off.

247
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,200
Didn't we? We did, yeah.

248
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,720
They did.

249
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,240
She's donating a painting for the
fete, it's going to cause

250
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,520
quite the stir!
Oh, it's just an old one.

251
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,680
Now, listen, um, we don't want
gifts at the wedding.

252
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,040
I mean, it's enough
that people slug it over

253
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,560
without then expecting a gift.

254
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,400
So we've decided to ask people
to make a small donation,

255
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,280
to a charity of their
choosing, in our name.

256
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,600
That sounds lovely.

257
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,040
Do you want to know what gift
I'm giving your father? Oh, Go

258
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,800
It's a portrait... Oh, God.

259
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,360
..of you girls. Oh, God. Um...

260
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,600
You mean...? Together, or...?

261
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,800
I'd only need a couple of sittings.
Right. Can't you use photos?

262
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,760
No, because the lighting's
never good enough,

263
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,320
and if you're not very photogenic
then it does you no favours.

264
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,000
And besides, the only photos
there are of you two together

265
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,760
are of when you were children,
and you looked like a boy, so...

266
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,080
You never told me you had a sister,
Claire. Oh, well, we, um.

267
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,760
We don't get to see each other much.

268
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,880
Do you see your brother?

269
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,640
Oh, I don't really
speak to my brother.

270
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,320
Oh, God, how desperately sad!

271
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,240
Why is that? Oh. Um, well...

272
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,800
You don't have to... No, that's OK.

273
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,080
Does he not approve of what you do,
of your choices?

274
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,280
No, it's not that, it's not that.
Is he not in the Church?

275
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,480
No, he's not in the Church.
Oh, it must be so hard!

276
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,800
Well, it's mainly hard...
Is it cos he's Mummy's favourite?

277
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,720
..because he's a paedophile.

278
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,880
Oh.

279
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,160
I'm aware of the irony of that.

280
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,520
LAUGHTER

281
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,000
Just a... Just a breath of air, eh?

282
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,520
Interesting man.

283
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,720
Mm.

284
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,640
No, thanks.

285
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,120
Darling, I'm sorry
I missed your birthday,

286
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,560
so I just got... Oh, that's OK.

287
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,880
No, no. I just...

288
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,040
In case you're struggling.

289
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,600
Oh, Dad, the cafe's going well...
No, no, this is not for work.

290
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,120
It's just for you.

291
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,600
Thanks.

292
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,360
You look, er...

293
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,360
..strong.
LAUGHING: Thanks.

294
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,600
Are you?

295
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
SHE LAUGHS

296
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,640
Are we going to have a fight?!
No, no! I'm sorry, no.

297
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,280
I just want to check that...

298
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760
..that you and I are...

299
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,800
Well, you're being very...

300
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,480
You're not being naughty.

301
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,760
SHE LAUGHS

302
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,440
No! Why? Oh...

303
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,840
Because, I guess...

304
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,040
Yeah?

305
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,480
..it doesn't matter.

306
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,680
Oh.

307
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,720
OK. Is that right?

308
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,040
I'm happy for you, Dad.

309
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,840
Thank you.

310
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,440
Ah! Thank you.
You're an exceptional waitress.

311
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,640
Apple juice?

312
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,440
Yeah.

313
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,560
I...

314
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,680
I just wanted to say,
I am so intrigued to see

315
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,120
how you're going to make this whole
evening about yourself.

316
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,360
HE LAUGHS

317
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,480
Oh, no.

318
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,240
We probably shouldn't arrive
at the table together.

319
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,680
A lot of people would say praying
is just talking to yourself

320
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
in the dark.
HE CHUCKLES

321
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,520
I guess it could look
like that, but, no,

322
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,760
it's more just about connecting
with yourself

323
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,080
at the end of each day.
It takes a bit of effort, but...

324
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,240
Yes, yes, I completely agree.
Positive energy takes work.

325
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
In the last six months,
I've excelled.

326
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,000
I take all the negative emotions
and just bottle them and bury them

327
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,760
and they never come out.
I'm not sure...

328
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,920
I've basically never been better.
Us neither.

329
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,880
I feel fantastic!

330
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,200
You're a very positive family,
I must say. Oh, absolutely.</

331
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,880
I think it's all about positivity.

332
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,920
It takes real commitment
to be this happy.

333
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,400
It's not just about eating
and drinking well, either.

334
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,680
Putting pine nuts on your salad
doesn't make you a grown-up.

335
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,440
Fucking does. It's about...

336
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,720
Well, in Finland, we, um...
They have this saying,

337
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,440
which I can't quite remember now...

338
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,640
It's, um... It's about

339
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,360
opening yourself up to the people
who want to love you.

340
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,720
And she is wide open lately.
THEY CHUCKLE

341
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,160
What do you do?
Oh, I work in finance.

342
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,320
What? What?

343
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
Across two firms, one
in Finland and one here.

344
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,400
No, no, she's a lawyer.
I thought you were a lawyer?

345
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,840
No. What?

346
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,880
I work with lawyers,
I'm not a lawyer.

347
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,480
Darling, you are a solicitor.

348
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,560
I went to business school.

349
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,960
You're being so quiet!
Why aren't you saying anything?

350
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,680
What do you want me to say?
Anything!

351
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,960
What's that in your hand?
She doesn't need to...

352
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,560
Birthday present from Dad.
It's a good thing, Claire.

353
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,920
Chunk of change? No, it's, er...

354
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,000
What is it? Don't know.
You don't need to...

355
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,720
I love presents,
I never get presents.

356
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,320
Well, it's because you might...
It's a voucher -

357
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,080
for a counselling session.

358
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,800
Thanks, Dad.
MARTIN LAUGHS

359
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,240
So thoughtful!
I'd kill for one of those!

360
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,080
I don't believe you can
pay your problems away,

361
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,840
I think you have to face who you are
and suffer the consequences.

362
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,680
It's the only road to happiness.

363
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,720
Maybe happiness isn't in what you
believe but who you believe.

364
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,600
Fuck.

365
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,040
Excuse me.

366
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,640
Oh! Do you think she needs anything?

367
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,080
ALL: No.

368
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,280
That was meant to be
a bedroom present.

369
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,240
A what? A present that you open in
your bedroom, alone.</font

370
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,360
All my presents are bedroom
presents, aren't they?

372
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,240
Do you want some more wine? Oh, yes.
No, actually.

373
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,680
Claire?

374
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,480
You've been ages.

375
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,200
Are you pissed off or
are you doing a poo?

376
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,280
SHE WHISPERS: Fuck. Fuck it.

377
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,080
Claire, can we just...

378
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,320
Have you got a... sanitary towel?

379
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,800
Oh, no, but I know a waitress
who would jump on that request.

380
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,720
Do you want me to ask her? No!

381
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,200
OK, well, there are some
sturdy hand towels here.

382
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,040
I could try and fashion something
with wings out of these.

383
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,520
Yes, fine.

384
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,680
Open the door.

385
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,960
Fuck, just give it...

386
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,240
Fuck! Give it to me! Don't come in!

387
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,400
It's a period!
It's not going to bite me!

388
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't look at it!
I'm not looking at your period!

389
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,560
Just take this.

390
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,840
Oh, God. It's not a period, it's a
fucking miscarriage, OK?

391
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,360
Jesus, Claire!

392
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,440
It's OK. No, it's not OK, you need
to go to a hospital!</fo

393
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,360
It's fine, I just need the...
Let me just... No!

It's OK. It's OK.

403
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,120
OK, we need to go to a hospital now.

404
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,640
Now.

405
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,360
Yes.

It's all good. OK.

Don't tell anyone. OK.

Let's get the coats,
I'll get a taxi.

I'll tell them I don't feel right.
OK. Thank you. <f

414

I've never been there, I get
antiques from there all the time.

I still haven't gone. Oh, really?

416

It'd be a wonderful place
to buy things like that. Yeah.</fo

Sorry, darling.
HE LAUGHS

Oh, good girl! Have one night off.

421
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,760
Wow! What did you say to her?
I, um...

422
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,360
Oh, nothing. I just, er...
Just sit down.

423
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,400
Come on, it's a party.
Can I have some?

424
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,080
Oh, someone's suddenly getting
into the party spirit now!

425
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,880
Sit down!

426
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,360
What did you take in there?

427
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,960
Your sister is finally
a good influence on you.

428
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,560
No, we just suddenly realised what a
monumental fucking day this is!

429
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,200
Drink. Honestly, just leave them in
there two minutes

430
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,040
and they're suddenly being
teenagers again!

Shall I get another bottle? Yes!

OK! Where's the waitress?

433
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,240
We were just talking about Venice,
and this wonderful trip we had...

434
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,640
How many times have we said
we have to go to Venice?

435
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,040
I've always wanted to go there.
Top of my list.

436
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,120
It's great. Yeah, I know...

Yeah, I'm, er...

No, I'm sorry, I just...

What's happened? Nothing's happened.
What's happened?</fon

Something's happened. Come on!

Come on!

446
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,880
Well, spit it out.
I just had a little...

447
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,400
Just say it. I just a little...

448
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,520
THEY ALL TALK OVER EACH OTHER

449
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,720
I just... What, darling?

450
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,600
I had a little miscarriage.

451
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,960
Oh, my God. What?

452
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
Um... What the fuck?

453
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Er... How far gone were you?

454
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,240
You should go to the hospital.
Whose was it?

455
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,800
Maybe leave that for later.
Was it the tooth man? Hospital, n

456
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,320
What about the bill? Sit down.
No, I'll cover her, I'll cover you.

457
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,280
She doesn't want to go! Why?!
Cos I'm stubborn,

458
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,720
and for some inexplicable reason
I'd rather stay here and have

459
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,840
a passive-aggressive party, so.
How far gone were you?

460
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,000
It was VERY early stages. You knew?

461
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,240
I really think she should see a
doctor. Yeah, so do I.

462
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,280
I thought you hadn't spoken?
She's fine. She's absolutely fine!

463
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,480
Drink. If it's gone, it's gone!

464
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,240
Claire... What if it's not gone?

465
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,040
It's gone. Darling...

466
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,280
Probably ectopic. Awful.

467
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,600
I'll pay you back.
Do you need someone to go with you?

468
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,240
No, I think I'll just deal with this
in my own insane, irrational,

469
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,720
anal way, if that's OK.

You know, it's like a goldfish out
the bowl, sort of thing.

473
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,280
If it didn't want to be in there,
it didn't want to be in there -

474
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,600
something wasn't right.

475
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,280
What?

476
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,160
It's the kid's choice if it wants to
jump ship, right?

477
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,080
