1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,290
Here's to love!

2
00:00:02,315 --> 00:00:04,612
Congratulations, you assholes!

3
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,521
Did you always want to join
the priesthood?

4
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:08,030
Oh, fuck no.

5
00:00:08,031 --> 00:00:09,390
Are you a real priest?

6
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:10,670
Yeah.

7
00:00:10,671 --> 00:00:13,457
So, do your family
get together much or...

8
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:15,110
Well, fuck you then.

9
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:17,200
And do you want to know what gift
I'm giving your father?

10
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:18,683
- Oh, God.
- It's a portrait.

11
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,278
- Oh, God.
- Of you girls.

12
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,442
- Oh, God.
- You pissed off or you doing a poo?

13
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:24,710
Get your hands off my miscarriage!

14
00:00:24,711 --> 00:00:26,041
- What's happened?
- Nothing's happened.

15
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:28,002
- Just had a little...
- What? What, darling?

16
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:29,711
- Miscarriage.
- Hospital now.

17
00:00:29,736 --> 00:00:31,080
What about the bill? Sit down.

18
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:32,134
I'll cover her. I'll cover you.

19
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,550
If you ever need someone. I'll be there.

20
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,315
If it didn't want to be in there,
it didn't want to be in there.

21
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,854
Something wasn't right.

22
00:00:39,504 --> 00:00:41,230
What the fuck!?

23
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:46,088
- The priest is quite hot.
- So hot.

24
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,670
Peace be with you.
Yeah, you too, thank you.

25
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:53,310
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

26
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:55,350
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

27
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:56,430
Peace be with you.

28
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,470
Peace be with you.

29
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:59,390
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

30
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:01,310
- Peace be with you.
- And also with you.

31
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,351
Let us pray.

32
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:15,030
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

33
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:20,710
thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven.

34
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:25,510
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,

35
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:29,510
as we forgive those who
trespass against us

36
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:33,230
and lead us not into temptation,

37
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:34,951
but deliver us from evil.

38
00:01:37,791 --> 00:01:38,898
Amen.

40
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:47,270
♪ Rooted, grafted, built on thee ♪

41
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:48,790
Please be seated.

42
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:50,055
And also with you.

43
00:01:57,751 --> 00:02:02,151
Um... Sorry, uh, yes, today's...

44
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:06,750
Um... Today's notices.

45
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:12,191
There's a raffle at tomorrow's
fete to raise funds for the...

46
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:16,550
Sorry... The diocesan
pilgrimage to Lourdes.

47
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:19,950
Uh, congratulations to
St Ethelred's Football Club.

48
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:21,510
Woo!

49
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,830
Three one victory.

50
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:25,190
Uh, next Friday is a first Friday
and I'm going to be

51
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:29,390
making my usual sick calls to the
housebound with the Eucharist

52
00:02:29,391 --> 00:02:33,310
and, finally, on Thursday I'm going
to begin Holy Communion

53
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:36,150
preparation classes and there are
more details of that

54
00:02:36,151 --> 00:02:39,470
in the parish newsletter,
along with my latest review.

55
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:42,350
That's all, folks.

56
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:44,431
Uh, please stand for God's blessing.

57
00:02:45,176 --> 00:02:46,589
Thanks so much.

58
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:48,206
- Thank you, Father.
- All the best. See you next week.

59
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:49,239
All the best.

60
00:02:49,264 --> 00:02:51,430
- Really good one, Father.
- Nice to see you, Gina.

61
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:53,230
Loved the story about your eye.

62
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:56,350
Off you go.
Give my regards to those budgies.

63
00:02:58,471 --> 00:03:00,550
- Hello.
- Hi.

64
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:03,150
- This is lovely.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

65
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:04,670
I thought you'd be in prison by now.

66
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:07,990
Ah, well, I keep trying,
but they just won't have me.

67
00:03:07,991 --> 00:03:09,990
- I'm sorry about your eye.
- Oh, that's okay.

68
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:11,430
Gives me some edge.

69
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:13,350
I've told them some heroic bullshit.

70
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:14,470
Um... Bless you, Sandy.

71
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,512
- Thank you, Father.
- Bless you.

72
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:16,629
Thank you, Father.

73
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:18,270
- Thank you.
- Bye.

74
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:19,950
- Bye now. Have a nice day.
- God bless you.

75
00:03:19,975 --> 00:03:22,095
- Bye. See you next week.
- Bless you.

76
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:25,038
I just wanted to pay
you back for dinner...

77
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:27,194
- Oh, no! Thank you, honestly.
- Because I... No, no, really, I insist.

78
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,054
- It'll have to be in instalments...
- I don't want it. I don't want it.

79
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,718
- I've got no pockets.
- Please...

80
00:03:30,742 --> 00:03:32,696
Honestly, thank you. Nah-ah!

81
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:35,516
I'm going to knife the candles, Father.
They're a bit clogged up.

82
00:03:35,541 --> 00:03:37,590
- Okay, Pam.
- Yeah.

83
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,507
Well, the hair dryer's in the,
in the wonky drawer...

84
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:41,990
Under the wonky drawer. Yes, I know.

85
00:03:41,991 --> 00:03:43,390
- Hello, love.
- Hi.

86
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,069
Oh, is that for the collection?
How sweet. So kind.

87
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:47,191
Thank you.

88
00:03:48,688 --> 00:03:49,808
That's Pam.

89
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:54,801
Do you like tea?

90
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,625
Jesus.

91
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:14,711
- Tea!
- Great.

92
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:18,925
I don't want boast, but I make
a cracking...

93
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,070
- Oh! Bastard! Sorry.
- Oh!

94
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,547
- Bastard!
- Um...

95
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,571
Let me just get this.

96
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:27,330
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, is that holy?

97
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:30,134
A bit less than it was before.

98
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:32,220
Shit. Uh... Oh, well.

99
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,033
He'll understand.
He's an understanding sort.

100
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:37,314
Okay.

101
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:41,111
There you go.

102
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:43,619
Sorry about all the tat.

103
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:46,470
It's for a fundraiser garden
party thing tomorrow.

104
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:48,350
So much stuff, absolutely no staff.

105
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:51,070
- You can volunteer if you want.
- Oh...

106
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:53,150
- I'm only joking.
- Oh.

107
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:55,830
You've probably got a life.

108
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:57,150
- What's the time?
- Um...

109
00:04:57,151 --> 00:05:00,030
Do you want a proper drink?
I've got cans of G&T.

110
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,670
From M&S.

111
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:03,550
- Well, it's...
- I will if you will.

112
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,340
Okay.

113
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:06,871
Okay.

114
00:05:15,351 --> 00:05:16,671
Thanks.

115
00:05:21,962 --> 00:05:23,579
So, you're a cool priest, are you?

116
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:24,875
- A cool priest?
- Yeah.

117
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,400
No. I'm a big reader with no friends.

118
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:27,510
Are you a cool person?

119
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:29,670
- I'm a pretty normal person.
- A normal person?

120
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:31,276
- Yeah, a normal person.
- What makes you a normal person?

121
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:33,671
Well, I don't believe in God...

122
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,883
I love it when He does that.

123
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:49,459
So, you were in my prayers last night.

124
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:50,974
Likewise.

125
00:05:51,031 --> 00:05:53,430
I'm sorry for your loss.

126
00:05:53,431 --> 00:05:55,110
What?

127
00:05:55,111 --> 00:05:56,391
Your baby.

128
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:00,050
Oh! Yeah, thank you.

129
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:03,071
Thank you. Yes, I...

130
00:06:04,771 --> 00:06:06,130
Thank you.

131
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:07,914
Is the father all right?

132
00:06:08,015 --> 00:06:10,279
Well, he doesn't really...

133
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:13,591
...exist.

134
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:16,671
I understand.

135
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:21,724
The funeral liturgy says

136
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:25,544
that life is changed, not ended.

137
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,430
I've always loved that,
if that's of any help.

138
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,727
Oh, well, thank you very much,
but I really am an atheist.

139
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,550
Yeah, I gathered
that by the smelling of the Bible.

140
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,936
New sermon?

141
00:06:39,961 --> 00:06:43,381
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's... I write, uh...

142
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,551
...restaurant reviews
for the parish magazine

143
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:47,295
and I was just finishing
up the last one.

144
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,887
I actually just came up with
a really good title.

145
00:06:48,912 --> 00:06:50,151
Ah, what is it?

146
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,341
- No.
- What?

147
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:54,590
- No, it's not cool.
- Well, neither are we, so...

148
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:57,278
"I'd spend 40 days and 40
nights in that dessert."

149
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:02,957
Oh, God, I fancy a priest.

150
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:40,951
There you go.

151
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:47,344
Hey.

152
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:49,350
Are you having an event?

153
00:07:49,351 --> 00:07:50,710
No.

154
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,390
Why are there so many people here?

155
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:54,550
Well, it's just successful, I guess.

156
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:56,854
Why is everyone talking to each other?

157
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,198
Oh, it's Chatty Wednesday.

158
00:07:58,223 --> 00:07:59,374
If you buy something,
you have to have a chat

159
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:01,206
- with someone you don't know.
- What?

160
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,110
Loneliness pays.

161
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:05,430
Listen, can we...

162
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:06,471
Sure.

163
00:08:10,871 --> 00:08:13,150
- I know you and I haven't...
- Have you had a check-up?

164
00:08:13,151 --> 00:08:15,630
Yes, it's fine.
It's really not a big deal.

165
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:17,141
- It happens all the time...
- Hello!

166
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:18,630
- No.
- Where you from?

167
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,540
I'm not... This isn't...
I'm not part of this.

168
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:23,912
I shouldn't have to...
I don't want to tell you that.

169
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:25,865
No. Sorry. No.

170
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:28,108
Tooting.

171
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,338
She hasn't bought anything yet, Joe.

172
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:33,363
Oh, shit. I'm so sorry.

173
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,366
Does Martin know?

174
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,335
You're not supposed to tell anyone
for the first 12...

175
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,585
- Well, you can tell the father.
- I just haven't told him.

176
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,758
- Okay, but what does he know?
- I don't want to talk about it, okay?

177
00:08:41,783 --> 00:08:44,117
And I never want anyone
to know about it.

178
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,274
You have it.

179
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,125
You're better at dealing with
awful things anyway.

180
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:48,520
- I don't want it.
- Well, you took it,

181
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:50,788
now everyone thinks
you have it, so you have it.

182
00:08:58,002 --> 00:08:59,601
What?

183
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,199
They're some pretty funky trainers.

184
00:09:01,224 --> 00:09:02,715
I said I'm fine.

185
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:04,440
I just really, really don't want
anyone to make

186
00:09:04,465 --> 00:09:06,033
a big deal out of this, okay?

187
00:09:06,058 --> 00:09:08,617
Brutal. Just brutal.

188
00:09:08,618 --> 00:09:10,297
You must feel rotten.

189
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:11,857
Do you feel rotten?

190
00:09:11,858 --> 00:09:14,007
I'd rather not talk about it if
that's okay.

191
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:16,057
Of course, darling. Come on up.

192
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:17,937
Claire get the door, for God's sake.

193
00:09:17,938 --> 00:09:19,727
Did you know who the father was?

194
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:21,907
Um, you know, I'd rather not
talk about it if that's okay.

195
00:09:21,932 --> 00:09:24,001
No, of course, darling.

196
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:26,851
I've got a set up I'm very
excited about.

197
00:09:26,876 --> 00:09:28,595
- It's going to be very striking.
- Cool.

198
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:30,955
So, Claire, if you just sit here.

199
00:09:30,956 --> 00:09:32,064
That's lovely

200
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,841
And, darling, just beside her like that.

201
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:36,406
Lovely.

202
00:09:36,431 --> 00:09:38,435
Actually, if you could just...

203
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:40,211
That's it, that's it.

204
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:41,596
Just a bit.

205
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:44,811
Bit more.

206
00:09:44,812 --> 00:09:46,211
There, perfect.

207
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:47,492
Gorgeous, yes.

208
00:09:50,892 --> 00:09:52,691
Sorry, no, if you could just...

209
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,692
That's it. Thank you, darling.

210
00:09:55,732 --> 00:09:58,011
- So, um...
- She can't not talk about it.

211
00:09:58,012 --> 00:10:00,091
- You know, I have six friends...
- A lie.

212
00:10:00,092 --> 00:10:02,451
...who've had miscarriages.

213
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:05,731
Five of them never managed to
produce a child afterwards,

214
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:07,965
but the sixth one did
and rather regretted it,

215
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:10,863
so I think you've probably done
the right thing.

216
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:12,132
Thank you.

217
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,526
Did you never want them?

218
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:17,191
Oh, I'm still thinking about it.

219
00:10:18,372 --> 00:10:20,291
Is Dad here? I texted him, but...

220
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:22,091
- Oh, I saw that.
- Oh, so he is here?

221
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:24,452
Sorry, no, I've got his phone today.

222
00:10:26,452 --> 00:10:28,131
I love that colour.

223
00:10:28,132 --> 00:10:29,171
Which one?

224
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:32,149
- That one.
- Oh, that's three colours.

225
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:34,468
Right. I'm getting rid of it.

226
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,491
But it was quite an adventure painting.

227
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:38,411
I had an orgasm as I finished it.

228
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:40,853
Well, let's hope we all get as much
pleasure out of this one.

229
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:42,220
No, no. Could you...?

230
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:44,967
Um, I have a pretty full
afternoon, so...

231
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:46,702
Oh, have you got to go back
to Finland again?

232
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,366
No, Finland are coming here.

233
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,971
Oh. Well, that's easier for you.

234
00:10:49,972 --> 00:10:51,131
Mmm.

235
00:10:51,132 --> 00:10:52,738
Are you still okay to pick up
the invitations?

236
00:10:52,763 --> 00:10:54,371
Oh, yes, of course.

237
00:10:54,372 --> 00:10:55,964
And did you find that ribbon
thing for the flowers?

238
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,451
- Yes.
- Great.

239
00:10:57,452 --> 00:10:58,956
And is Martin's nose on the mend?

240
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:00,049
Yes.

241
00:11:00,074 --> 00:11:01,863
And how's the bassoon solo coming on?

242
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:03,450
Oh, yes, he's practising.

243
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:05,769
- Oh, God, and now I just have to...
- What?

244
00:11:05,794 --> 00:11:07,193
Sorry, Claire, can you look up, please?

245
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:08,225
Thank you.

246
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,651
Organise canapes for an awards ceremony.

247
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:12,491
Oh, gosh, you must be exhausted.

248
00:11:12,492 --> 00:11:14,313
Does the little cafe do canapes?

249
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:16,118
It totally could, yeah.

250
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:18,662
Well, there you are.
That's one off the list.

251
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:19,727
Great.

252
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:26,975
Gosh, haven't you got a lovely,
thick neck?

253
00:11:28,892 --> 00:11:30,611
- That was fun.
- Thank you.

254
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:32,433
I really can help with
the canapes if it's...

255
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,783
- I'm going to say this quickly. Okay?
- Okay.

256
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:36,971
Martin wants to press
charges against you for assault.

257
00:11:36,972 --> 00:11:39,066
I've tried to talk him down, but to
be fair, you did hit him

258
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,532
- fucking hard.
- What?!

259
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,996
I will provide you with exceptional
legal advice as long as

260
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:45,276
you don't tell anyone I'm providing
you with exceptional legal advice.

261
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:47,136
- What?!
- This is happening.

262
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:50,040
I am mortified, but it is happening, okay?

263
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:52,011
I will hire this lawyer to scare him off

264
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:54,782
and I will hire you to do the canapes.

265
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:56,371
- Who's the lawyer?
- Oh, he's a friend.

266
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:58,251
He mainly defends rapists.

267
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,433
He has a high success rate then.

268
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:02,097
Undefeated. Come on.

269
00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:04,331
I've filled him in with the basics.

270
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:06,696
- That your husband's an animal?
- Be serious.

271
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,467
Just do whatever he says
and don't flirt with him.

272
00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:12,496
I'm not going to f...

273
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:14,731
Fucking hell, okay.

274
00:12:14,732 --> 00:12:16,491
- Claire!
- David, thank you so much...

275
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:18,051
- Oh! Sorry.
- Wow.

276
00:12:18,052 --> 00:12:19,571
I can take you to court for that.

277
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,302
This the little trouble maker, then?

278
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,651
- Hi.
- Hi.

279
00:12:23,652 --> 00:12:27,076
Now, listen, I just want to be
clear that whatever happens,

280
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,834
I don't sleep with people
I work with, okay?

281
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:35,336
I'm joking.

282
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:37,187
Slip on in, ladies.

283
00:12:37,212 --> 00:12:40,344
Well, if you spit guilty, you'll
have to swallow a short jail term,

284
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,859
or community service if you're lucky.

285
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:42,913
Or?

286
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:44,361
- You definitely started it?
- Yes.

287
00:12:44,386 --> 00:12:47,174
- Any witnesses?
- About 30.

288
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,197
The most important thing, honey,

289
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:52,615
is that you do not, under any
circumstances, apologise.

290
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,810
- I can do that...
- No, that's not what we discussed.

291
00:12:54,835 --> 00:12:57,611
Well, that can be taken
as an admission of guilt.

292
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,571
I assume you know the victim personally?

293
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:01,604
- Yes...
- No, and let's not call him

294
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,891
- the victim yet, shall we?
- Well, that's what he is.

295
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:05,691
Yes. Right.

296
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:07,091
They've definitely fucked.

297
00:13:07,092 --> 00:13:08,851
We just want a letter to scare him off

298
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:10,451
if he ends up seeking proper action.

299
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:12,568
- Really doesn't make sense, Claire.
- Actually maybe not.

300
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:14,123
I think it makes perfect sense.

301
00:13:14,148 --> 00:13:16,240
- I just want to be ahead of the game.
- God, I can't tell.

302
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:18,748
- That's a habit of yours, I've heard.
- Oh, I've got it.

303
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:19,999
- Is it?
- They haven't...

304
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:21,499
You're going to have to tell me
who said that.

305
00:13:21,523 --> 00:13:22,982
- Never.
- ...but they're going to.

306
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:24,796
- David.
- Oh, God, I've got to get out.

307
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:26,387
- Claire.
- Excuse me.

308
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,384
Where you off to, little lady?

309
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:30,634
I'm just going to let this... Yeah.

310
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:48,587
You all right?

311
00:13:48,588 --> 00:13:50,680
Yeah. Just thought I'd leave you to it.

312
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:53,387
- Sorry.
- What?

313
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:55,500
He says he'll only talk you through
potential proceedings

314
00:13:55,525 --> 00:13:57,133
- if you go for a drink with him.
- What?

315
00:13:57,157 --> 00:13:58,683
- I know.
- Outrageous.

316
00:13:58,708 --> 00:14:00,427
- Stop smiling.
- I thought he was after you?

317
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:03,162
So did I, but my hair isn't great at
the moment.

318
00:14:03,187 --> 00:14:05,067
Either way, it's very inappropriate.

319
00:14:05,068 --> 00:14:06,454
- Don't sleep with him.
- I won't.

320
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,712
- Don't.
- I won't.

321
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:08,844
I don't do that anymore.

322
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:11,187
What? Why? Are you ill?

323
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:12,667
- No.
- Then what?

324
00:14:12,668 --> 00:14:15,103
Well, I just...

325
00:14:15,128 --> 00:14:16,751
Oh, my God. Have you met someone?

326
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:19,107
Well, not really.

327
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,707
- Back with Harry?
- No, it's actually...

328
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,815
- Someone new?
- Well...

329
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,988
- Is he single?
- Sort of.

330
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:27,347
Take this.

331
00:14:27,348 --> 00:14:29,753
I'll try talk Martin down,
but call him if you need him.

332
00:14:29,778 --> 00:14:31,627
He's a very good lawyer.

333
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:33,747
Surprisingly...

334
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:36,084
...tender underneath it all.

335
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:37,600
Knew it.

336
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,881
What you did in the restaurant
was unforgiveable.

337
00:14:39,905 --> 00:14:41,905
I know.

338
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,188
Thank you.

339
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,731
Okay, well...

340
00:14:46,756 --> 00:14:49,590
Listen, I actually just wanted to
give you... this.

341
00:14:49,615 --> 00:14:51,967
It's just one session, but you've
been through a lot, so I just...

342
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,788
Oh, my God, I said I'm fine.

343
00:14:55,188 --> 00:14:56,428
I'm weirdly fine.

344
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:00,748
I'd rather have the money.

345
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:18,645
Excuse me, I've got dry forearms.

346
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,661
Sure.

347
00:15:23,068 --> 00:15:24,867
So, why have you come to the session?

348
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:26,952
Oh, it was a birthday
present from my father.

349
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:29,427
Is that a joke?

350
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,788
No.

351
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:34,427
It would be good not to make
jokes in here.

352
00:15:34,428 --> 00:15:39,524
Just in case anything gets
lost in humorous translation.

353
00:15:39,548 --> 00:15:41,668
Oh, I don't know if I can do that.

354
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,467
Is that a joke?

355
00:15:44,468 --> 00:15:45,508
No.

356
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:50,670
Oh, just try not to, or make
it very obvious.

357
00:15:51,548 --> 00:15:52,867
Sure.

358
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,803
So, why do you think your father
suggested you come for counselling?

359
00:15:55,828 --> 00:15:58,609
I think because my mother died
and he can't talk about it

360
00:15:58,634 --> 00:16:00,790
and my sister and I didn't speak for
a year because she thinks

361
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:02,743
I tried to sleep with her husband
and because I spent most

362
00:16:02,768 --> 00:16:05,501
of my adult life using sex to
deflect from the screaming void

363
00:16:05,526 --> 00:16:08,123
inside my empty heart. I'm good at this.

364
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:10,051
Although I don't really
do that any more.

365
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:12,723
You close with your family?

366
00:16:14,778 --> 00:16:16,187
We get on with it.

367
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:18,547
- Do you talk?
- God no!

368
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:20,507
Any friends?

369
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:22,748
- Sorry?
- Any friends?

370
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:26,187
Um...

371
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:28,161
No, I don't really have time for...

372
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:31,067
Well, I have a guinea pig,
but she blows hot and cold.

373
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:32,302
Not a joke.

374
00:16:33,908 --> 00:16:35,907
Tell me about the sex.

375
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:39,907
All of it?

376
00:16:39,908 --> 00:16:41,667
You said you don't do that now.

377
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,375
Oh, no, I just play tennis now.

378
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:46,791
Tough crowd.

379
00:16:48,068 --> 00:16:49,408
Sorry.

380
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:51,377
I just...

381
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:54,244
Sex didn't bring anything...

382
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:56,556
good, so I'm trying not to...

383
00:16:58,102 --> 00:16:59,501
But I've...

384
00:16:59,572 --> 00:17:01,643
And what have you found
in your abstinence?

385
00:17:01,668 --> 00:17:04,588
Well, I'm very horny and
your little scarf isn't helping.

386
00:17:06,748 --> 00:17:09,275
So, the impulse is still there?

387
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:11,103
Oh...

388
00:17:11,172 --> 00:17:14,361
Yeah, the impulse is...

389
00:17:14,388 --> 00:17:17,239
The impulse is very much still there.

390
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:19,442
It's just never the right person.

391
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:20,947
Mm.

392
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:23,739
So there is a particular person
you're not having sex with?

393
00:17:23,788 --> 00:17:25,286
No!

394
00:17:25,348 --> 00:17:28,267
Well, look, nothing's happened.
I just...

395
00:17:28,268 --> 00:17:30,067
He's not available.

396
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:32,307
- In a relationship?
- Yes, a bad one.

397
00:17:32,308 --> 00:17:33,987
Oh, really? How so?

398
00:17:33,988 --> 00:17:35,786
It's a sort of relationship
where one partner

399
00:17:35,811 --> 00:17:38,375
- tells the other how to dress.
- Are you in love with him?

400
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,302
No!

401
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,547
Why do you find that funny?

402
00:17:42,548 --> 00:17:44,267
Well, I...

403
00:17:44,268 --> 00:17:46,187
I dunno, I just...

404
00:17:46,188 --> 00:17:48,427
I don't... No!

405
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:50,677
- Just not a romantic?
- No.

406
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:52,987
Just...

407
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:55,209
a girl with no friends
and an empty heart?

408
00:17:58,748 --> 00:18:00,228
By your own description.

409
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:07,427
I have friends.

410
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:09,348
Oh, so you do have someone to talk to.

411
00:18:11,348 --> 00:18:12,508
Yeah.

412
00:18:14,588 --> 00:18:16,067
Do you see them a lot?

413
00:18:16,068 --> 00:18:18,385
Oh, they're... they're always there.

414
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,096
They're...

415
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:21,941
They're always there.

416
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:23,886
Why do you find that funny?

417
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,385
Listen, I don't need to be analysed.

418
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,699
I have a nice life. I just...

419
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:28,723
I just wanted to exchange
the voucher for the money.

420
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:30,627
It's a bit late for that now.

421
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:32,348
I've only been here five minutes.

422
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,862
I want the money.

423
00:18:39,188 --> 00:18:41,284
I want to fuck a priest.

424
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:43,067
- Catholic?
- Yes!

425
00:18:43,068 --> 00:18:44,747
- A good one?
- Yes!

426
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,682
- Looks good in the...
- Mmm, yes.

427
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:48,494
I understand.

428
00:18:49,068 --> 00:18:50,987
Do you really want to fuck the priest,

429
00:18:50,988 --> 00:18:53,227
or do you want to fuck God?

430
00:18:53,228 --> 00:18:56,027
- Can you fuck God?
- Oh, yes.

431
00:18:56,028 --> 00:18:59,415
Look just please tell me
how to not fuck a priest,

432
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,079
before I get arrested.

433
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:03,532
Well, I don't think fucking a priest
will make you feel as powerful

434
00:19:03,557 --> 00:19:06,307
- as you think it will.
- Can you just tell me what to do?

435
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:07,555
You know.

436
00:19:08,868 --> 00:19:11,827
You already know what you're
going to do. Everybody does.

437
00:19:11,828 --> 00:19:13,107
What?!

438
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:15,570
You've already decided
what you're going to do.

439
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:18,587
So what's the point in you?

440
00:19:20,268 --> 00:19:21,788
You know what you're going to do.

441
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:25,027
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

442
00:19:25,028 --> 00:19:26,406
- I don't!
- You do!

443
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,559
- I don't! I don't...
- You do!

444
00:19:29,341 --> 00:19:31,174
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

445
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:32,681
Shut up.

446
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,627
Hi, can I have two
raffle tickets, please?

447
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:38,016
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God, hi!

448
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,827
Hi! You're...

449
00:19:39,852 --> 00:19:40,890
- Yeah!
- ...with child.

450
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:41,857
- Yes.
- Cool!

451
00:19:41,882 --> 00:19:43,366
- You, you got a fringe!
- Yeah!

452
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,443
Yeah. Oh, cool.

453
00:19:44,468 --> 00:19:47,320
- Aw, you always wanted a baby!
- You always wanted a fringe.

454
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:49,276
She is amazing.

455
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:51,797
- I mean, it's been tough, but amazing.
- Oh, yeah?

456
00:19:51,822 --> 00:19:53,840
Yeah, I mean, the birth
really took its toll.

457
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:55,983
- Oh, really? Was it a tricky one?
- I can't really remember it now.

458
00:19:56,008 --> 00:19:59,420
But the whole thing has
just really changed me.

459
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:01,080
I just don't feel...

460
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:02,779
You know, my emotions are up and down.

461
00:20:02,803 --> 00:20:05,416
My body just feels different.

462
00:20:05,441 --> 00:20:08,601
I mean, Elaine is being amazing,
so supportive...

463
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:10,277
It sounds like you have got
post-natal depression.

464
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:12,730
I do, yeah, but we're
working through it.

465
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:15,861
- Sure.
- Just to let you know,

466
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,629
the band is going to start
in a couple of minutes.

467
00:20:17,654 --> 00:20:19,360
Hey, Father. This is Suzie!

468
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:21,720
Aw, I don't know how
to talk to babies, sorry.

469
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,360
Do you guys know each other?

470
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:25,001
- Uh, yeah.
- We sort of used to...

471
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,094
I used to be her girlfriend.

472
00:20:27,121 --> 00:20:28,481
Oh, cool.

473
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:31,561
Good for you!

474
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:33,402
I'm going to go
and show her the coconuts.

475
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:36,076
- She's really good at counting.
- Okay.

476
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:38,000
Excuse me, everyone!

477
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:41,840
The Youthy Band is about to
play the ode to something!

478
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,660
- You having fun?
- Yes, yeah.

479
00:20:43,685 --> 00:20:45,089
- Selling well? Good.
- Yes, I think so.

480
00:20:45,114 --> 00:20:46,488
Oh, puzzle. I love a puzzle!

481
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,450
- The Youthy Band are about...
- Yes, I heard you, Pam.

482
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:50,661
Thank you, thank you so much. Thank you.

483
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:55,025
- Ah, there's the main event.
- Yeah!

484
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:57,954
- Very talented.
- She, uh, she...

485
00:20:57,979 --> 00:21:00,209
Don't say it. She, she, actually...

486
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:01,318
Just don't say it.

487
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,600
She actually orgasmed
when she finished it.

488
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:04,800
I just said it.

489
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:06,545
- Apparently.
- Ah!

490
00:21:08,873 --> 00:21:10,713
Well, whatever gets you there!

491
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:16,770
Father! Father, we have
a cupcake situation over here!

492
00:21:16,795 --> 00:21:18,680
Okay, Pam! I will be there to cupcake.

493
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:21,921
Thank you so much for helping.

494
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:29,149
Arm touch.

495
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:39,440
At least my son is in the
Youthy Band, what's your excuse?

496
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:41,400
Urgh!

497
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,520
I'm helping the priest.

498
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:46,600
Wow, you do love a challenge, don't you?

499
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:48,529
Hey, I just want to say something...

500
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:50,320
It's from River Island.
I got it last week.

501
00:21:50,345 --> 00:21:54,840
No. I want to say that I'm sorry
for saying what I said.

502
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm sorry for what you went through.

503
00:21:57,201 --> 00:21:58,749
I'm sorry.

504
00:21:58,773 --> 00:22:00,480
I know what you're doing.
I'm not going to say it.

505
00:22:00,481 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm just saying sorry.

506
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:03,280
I'm not going to say it.

507
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm sorry.

508
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:06,161
Mm-mm.

509
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,011
Okay.

510
00:22:11,041 --> 00:22:12,520
And thank you.

511
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:14,560
- She and I have never been better.
- Oh!

512
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:16,600
You had a big part in that.

513
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,600
I'm happy for you.

514
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:21,632
I'm happy you've found a way
to deflect from your pitiful,

515
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:24,757
self-sabotaging, ego-driven,
masturbatory...

516
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:26,680
I cannot believe how well
this is coming out.

517
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:29,120
...pawing, insidious, insidious,

518
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:30,921
overwhelming mediocrity,

519
00:22:30,946 --> 00:22:33,353
only to finally figure out
that at your very core,

520
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:36,674
you are a weaky.

521
00:22:37,561 --> 00:22:38,720
Damn!

522
00:22:38,721 --> 00:22:41,080
- A "weaky"?
- Damn! Damn!

523
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:43,109
Wow. A "weaky"?

524
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:52,280
In that case, I just wanted you to know

525
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,820
that I'm impressed with
how you just keep bouncing back.

526
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,640
I really am.

527
00:22:57,641 --> 00:23:00,552
You're a strongy.

528
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,363
That was awesome, man.

529
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:05,040
Creepy Jake, mainly says things like...

530
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:06,440
- Where's Claire?
- ...and...

531
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:07,520
Where's Claire?

532
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,040
She couldn't make it, man.

533
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:12,103
Lucky for us, your aunt
is an avid church goer.

534
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,520
Hi. Thanks for watching.

535
00:23:13,521 --> 00:23:15,976
Oh, you were excellent.

536
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:17,640
- Oh!
- Ooh.

537
00:23:17,641 --> 00:23:19,160
Careful there, buddy.

538
00:23:19,161 --> 00:23:21,486
You could go down for that
sort of behaviour these days.

539
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:23,808
- It was just a hug.
- "Oh, it was just a hug!"

540
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,722
You got to do better
than that these days, boy.

541
00:23:25,747 --> 00:23:28,136
- Specially round this firecracker.
- But I didn't do...

542
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,628
Come on.

543
00:23:30,521 --> 00:23:32,537
I don't want to be an asshole.

544
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:34,480
I just want her to be happy.

545
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:38,147
And she has been really happy...

546
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:39,991
...until she saw you.

547
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:42,637
Just saying.

548
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,041
Wow.

549
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:56,654
Psst.

550
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:58,560
Hi, Jake. Ooh.

551
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:01,896
Tell her to leave him.

552
00:24:01,921 --> 00:24:03,600
What?

553
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:07,766
Tell her to leave him.

554
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,481
He's going to kill someone one day.

555
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:24,254
- Hey!
- Yes, Father?

556
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:25,322
Yes, Father?

557
00:24:25,347 --> 00:24:27,104
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...

558
00:24:27,129 --> 00:24:28,207
Oh, God.

559
00:24:28,232 --> 00:24:31,160
Can I get that coconut back?
They're actually on hire.

560
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:33,480
I'm not sure if a lot of them
are even real, actually,

561
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:36,504
which is morally a bit dubious,
but we've got to make money somehow.

562
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:39,360
- Thank you.
- Knuckle brush.

563
00:24:39,361 --> 00:24:42,156
Also, I hope you don't mind, but, um...

564
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:45,026
I've marked a few pages in here
that I thought might be...

565
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,619
Ooh, eh.

566
00:24:46,644 --> 00:24:48,764
No, no, no, no. I'm not trying to...

567
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,710
They're just words.

568
00:24:51,761 --> 00:24:55,760
Okay, it's just I...
I think I know what happens.

569
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:57,041
Classic.

570
00:24:58,641 --> 00:24:59,961
Come on, have a read.

571
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:04,345
I'd like to know what do you think.

572
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:06,457
And if you ever want to...

573
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:08,598
talk about stuff, I'm here.

574
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:10,645
With a G&T, of course.

575
00:25:12,015 --> 00:25:13,655
You can come whenever you want.

576
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,152
I'd like you to come,

577
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:18,755
if it helps.
