A huge thanks to Matthew, Mark, Luke

183
00:08:06,859 --> 00:08:09,825
with this award. And to LinkedIn

this evening and beyond.

185
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:14,868
I am so excited to introduce
Sylvia Hamburg,

186
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,068
this year's winner of Women Who Work,

187
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:20,468
who will announce this year's
Best Woman in Business.

188
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:21,948
Sylvia.

189
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:23,269
What a legend!

190
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,109
I'll do it!

191
00:08:36,189 --> 00:08:38,548
I can do it.

192
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,632
I'm sorry,
it appears that Sylvia is busy,

193
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:45,109
which shouldn't come
as a surprise, really.

194
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:50,708
I-It's been a big year for business...

195

the past few decades.

198
00:08:57,749 --> 00:09:01,028
I'd like to thank all
the brilliant men and women

199
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:03,268
for supporting each other here
at Hurbots.

200
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:05,148
We're a family, really.

201
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:07,588
And if we've learned anything
during the past 12 months,

202
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,788
it's that family really shouldn't
touch each other up

Well, um...

212
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:58,247
Well, I was going to say
this is a bit on the nose,

213
00:09:58,272 --> 00:10:00,215
- but she doesn't seem to have one.
- [LAUGHTER]

214
00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:02,548
- What were you thinking?
- It'll be fine.

215
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:05,950
It's not fine.
I awarded her with a pair of tits.

216
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:08,948
- Chase her down.
- Chase her down?

217
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:10,508
It's a stolen piece of art.

218
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,428
I will deal with the photographer.

I love the joke.

Oh, well, I didn't think
it was that funny.

I'm trained in martial arts.

It's just the basics, but it is enough.

- Hurbots.

00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:54,908
Yes, I ate a courgette off your tray.

- Yeah, it was delicious.
- Thank you.

00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:01,788
That.

Why?

00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:07,414
It's a stolen piece of art.
It's not really an award.

236
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,228
It's all my fault. I can explain.

237
00:11:09,229 --> 00:11:10,988
Is it a long story?

238
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:12,389
Sort of.

you did exactly the right thing.

No, no, it's ghettoising.

Did you make the canapes?

268
00:12:17,829 --> 00:12:19,689
No, actually. I stole them.

I promise.

00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:36,731
Listen, I was in an aeroplane
the other day and I realised...

275
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,107
Well, I... I mean, I've been longing
to say this out loud.

276
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:45,610
Women are born with pain built in.

277
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:48,228
It's our physical destiny.

278
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:51,909
Period pains, sore boobs,
childbirth, you know.

279
00:12:53,069 --> 00:12:56,668
We carry it within ourselves
throughout our lives.

280
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:58,028
Men don't.

281
00:12:58,029 --> 00:12:59,548
They have to seek it out.

282
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:01,588
They invent all these gods
and demons and things

283
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:03,508
just so they can feel
guilty about things,

284
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,508
which is something we do
very well on our own.

285
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:09,708
And then they create wars,
so they can feel things

286
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:11,652
and touch each other,
and when there aren't any wars

287
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:12,768
they can play rugby.

288
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:16,508
And we have it all
going on in here, inside.

289
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:20,483
We have pain on a cycle for years
and years and years

290
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:24,608
and then, just when you feel
you are making peace with it all,

291
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,188
what happens?

292
00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:27,468
The menopause comes.

293
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:30,435
The fucking menopause comes and it is...

294
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,409
...the most...

295
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:38,367
...wonderful fucking thing in the world!

296
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:41,751
And, yes, your entire
pelvic floor crumbles

297
00:13:41,776 --> 00:13:45,536
and you get fucking hot
and no-one cares, but then...

298
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:48,308
...you're free.

299
00:13:48,668 --> 00:13:53,799
No longer a slave,
no longer a machine, with parts.

300
00:13:54,549 --> 00:13:57,056
You're just a person in business.

301
00:13:57,989 --> 00:13:59,948
Oh.

302
00:13:59,949 --> 00:14:01,388
I was told it was horrendous.

303
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:04,108
It is horrendous,
but then it's magnificent.

304
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,669
Something to look forward to.

305
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:12,548
You better get back to that party.

306
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:14,508
- Your party.
- Mm.

307
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:17,508
It is not a party
until someone flirts with you.

308
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:20,348
And that's the only really
shit thing about getting older,

309
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:23,068
is that people don't flirt
with you anymore.

310
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:25,268
Not really. Not with danger.

311
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,735
I miss walking into a room
and not knowing,

312
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,348
and there's a sort of energy, a dare.

313
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:33,737
Do not take that for granted.

314
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:39,104
There is nothing more exciting
than a room full of people.

315
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:41,628
Yeah, except most people are...

316
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:42,909
What?

317
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:45,989
...shit.

318
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:49,628
Look at me.

319
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,028
Listen.

320
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,989
People are all we've got.

321
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:57,324
People are all we've got.

322
00:14:57,349 --> 00:15:00,732
So grab the night by its nipples
and go and flirt with someone.

323
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,216
No, that's not what I meant!

324
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,908
Oh.

325
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,992
I wish you were my type.

326
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:16,655
Take this tart back to my party

327
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,628
and go and find someone to
actually do that with.

328
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:20,228
- I want to do it with you.
- No.

329
00:15:20,229 --> 00:15:22,233
- Why not?
- Honestly?

330
00:15:22,257 --> 00:15:23,413
Yeah.

331
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:25,228
I can't be arsed, darling.

332
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:29,085
I'm going to go back to my room
and have one more martini,

333
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,054
and if you need anything, call me.

334
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,359
Anything.

335
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,469
You can have whoever
you want at your age.

336
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:38,933
Except the Best Woman in Business.

337
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,127
Well, that's just because
she's exhausted.

338
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:44,437
33 isn't exactly...

339
00:15:44,438 --> 00:15:46,957
And what had Jesus done by 33?

340
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,437
- Died?
- Exactly!

341
00:15:48,438 --> 00:15:50,118
So get out there and flirt.

342
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:02,413
- Here you are!
- Oh, hi!

343
00:16:02,438 --> 00:16:03,818
Thought you might be snogging Finland.

344
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:06,797
Ha-ha! No, just sorting a few things!

345
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:07,957
I got her!

346
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:09,157
Oh!

347
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:10,877
And Belinda gave me her card.

348
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:12,158
Oh, that's great!

349
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:15,317
- What?
- Nothing.

350
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:16,637
She's furious.

351
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:17,877
Really?

352
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:19,717
Yes! It was a great night.

353
00:16:19,718 --> 00:16:23,387
Everything went smoothly in the end,
and everyone loved the canapes.

354
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:24,771
Really? I'm a dead woman.

355
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:26,613
- Really?
