361

Do you know there was a man who
wanted to be a saint

362
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:07,387
so badly he castrated himself just
to stop himself?

363
00:18:08,578 --> 00:18:10,904
You know... whack!

364
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:13,699

366
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,510
And those who get in the way of it.

367
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:42,937
I'm sorry about today.

368
00:18:44,294 --> 00:18:45,556
Forget it.

369
00:18:46,361 --> 00:18:48,281
Look at this.

370
00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:55,349
Look at it.

371
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:57,043
That's the first one I ever got.

372
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,970
Went all the way to Rome for that.

373
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,455
Such a nerd!

374
00:19:04,001 --> 00:19:07,658
Two years before I was even allowed
to wear it, but I just...

375
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,017
I couldn't wait.

376
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:13,306
I couldn't wait! I knew I wanted a bold,

377
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,205
you know, this colour, but proper plum.

378
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,430
You can only get proper plum in Italy.

379
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,950
Sometimes I worry I'm
only in it for the outfits.

380
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,512
So beautiful, isn't it?

381
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:31,849
I mean, your stuff is lovely, too.

questions, do you?

Okay.

Come with me.

386
00:20:00,836 --> 00:20:02,430
I know what to do with you.

387
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,844
You go in there, I go in there.

388
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:09,238
And you make me tell you all my secrets

389
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:11,191
so you can ultimately trap
and control me?

390
00:20:11,215 --> 00:20:13,416
- Yeah. No.
- [LAUGHS]

391
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:14,810
You tell me what's weighing
on your heart

392
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:16,051
and I listen without judgment

393
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,184
- and in complete confidence.
- Sounds dodgy!

394
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:19,429
I just listen.

395
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,625
At the very least it'll
shut me up for a minute.

396
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:23,797
- I'm not Catholic.
- Tonight, that doesn't matter.

397
00:20:23,844 --> 00:20:25,352
Won't I catch fire or something?

398
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,669
If you did, it would confirm
my faith, so let's try it.

399
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,341
Go on.

400
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,960
Go on.

401
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,110
All right.

402
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,123
Okay, now you say, "Bless me
father for I have sinned."

403
00:20:55,201 --> 00:20:57,326
- I'm not going to say that!
- Well, very good.

404
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,887
"It's been..."
Uh, enter days, years, months

405
00:20:59,943 --> 00:21:01,566
- "...since my last confession."
- Mm-hmm.

406
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:04,099
Then I say, "That's okay,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah",

407
00:21:04,153 --> 00:21:05,466
till you tell me what's on your mind.

- Sins, if you want. [CHUCKLES]

- Because it will make you feel better!

- About?
- About the miscarriage.

418
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:46,370
I was just covering for my sister
who actually had the miscarriage,

419
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,190
because her husband didn't know
she was pregnant, and it just...

420
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:51,435
Okay.

And I've stolen things.

423
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:05,250
I've had a lot of sex
outside of marriage.

424
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:09,307
And once or twice inside someone else's.

425
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:12,551
And there's been a spot of sodomy.

426
00:22:13,112 --> 00:22:16,182
Um, there's been much masturbation,

427
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:18,815

the endless fucking blasphemy.
