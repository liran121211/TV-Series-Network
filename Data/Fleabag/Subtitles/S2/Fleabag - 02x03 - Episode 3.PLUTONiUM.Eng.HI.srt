A huge thanks to Matthew, Mark, Luke

183
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,341
with this award. And to LinkedIn

this evening and beyond.

00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:15,384
I am so excited to introduce
Sylvia Hamburg,

186
00:08:15,385 --> 00:08:17,584
this year's winner of Women Who Work,

187
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:20,984
who will announce this year's
Best Woman in Business.

188
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:22,464
Sylvia.

189
00:08:22,465 --> 00:08:23,785
What a legend!

190
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:35,625
I'll do it!

191
00:08:36,705 --> 00:08:39,064
I can do it.

192
00:08:39,065 --> 00:08:43,148
I'm sorry,
it appears that Sylvia is busy,

193
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:45,625
which shouldn't come
as a surprise, really.

194
00:08:47,562 --> 00:08:51,224
I-It's been a big year for business...

195

the past few decades.

00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:01,544
I'd like to thank all
the brilliant men and women

199
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:03,784
for supporting each other here
at Hurbots.

200
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:05,664
We're a family, really.

201
00:09:05,665 --> 00:09:08,104
And if we've learned anything
during the past 12 months,

202
00:09:08,105 --> 00:09:10,304
it's that family really shouldn't
touch each other up

Well, um...

212
00:09:56,865 --> 00:09:58,763
Well, I was going to say
this is a bit on the nose,

213
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:00,731
- but she doesn't seem to have one.
- [LAUGHTER]

214
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:03,064
- What were you thinking?
- It'll be fine.

215
00:10:03,065 --> 00:10:06,466
It's not fine.
I awarded her with a pair of tits.

216
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:09,464
- Chase her down.
- Chase her down?

217
00:10:09,465 --> 00:10:11,024
It's a stolen piece of art.

218
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,944

I love the joke.

it was that funny.

I'm trained in martial arts.

It's just the basics, but it is enough.

- I work at Harbots.
- Hurbots.

00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,424
Yes, I ate a courgette off your tray.

- Yeah, it was delicious.
- Thank you.

What do you want?

00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:02,304
That.

00:11:04,985 --> 00:11:06,064
Why?

235
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:07,930
It's a stolen piece of art.
It's not really an award.

236
00:11:07,955 --> 00:11:09,744
It's all my fault. I can explain.

237
00:11:09,745 --> 00:11:11,504
Is it a long story?

238
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,905
Sort of.

you did exactly the right thing.

No, no, it's ghettoising.

Did you make the canapes?

268
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:20,205
No, actually. I stole them.

I promise.

00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:37,247
Listen, I was in an aeroplane
the other day and I realised...

275
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:40,623
Well, I... I mean, I've been longing
to say this out loud.

276
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:46,126
Women are born with pain built in.

277
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:48,744
It's our physical destiny.

278
00:12:48,745 --> 00:12:52,425
Period pains, sore boobs,
childbirth, you know.

279
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:57,184
We carry it within ourselves
throughout our lives.

280
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:58,544
Men don't.

281
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:00,064
They have to seek it out.

282
00:13:00,065 --> 00:13:02,104
They invent all these gods
and demons and things

283
00:13:02,105 --> 00:13:04,024
just so they can feel
guilty about things,

284
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,024
which is something we do
very well on our own.

285
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:10,224
And then they create wars,
so they can feel things

286
00:13:10,225 --> 00:13:12,168
and touch each other,
and when there aren't any wars

287
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,284
they can play rugby.

288
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:17,024
And we have it all
going on in here, inside.

289
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:20,999
We have pain on a cycle for years
and years and years

290
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:25,124
and then, just when you feel
you are making peace with it all,

291
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:26,704
what happens?

292
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:27,984
The menopause comes.

293
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:30,951
The fucking menopause comes and it is...

294
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:34,925
...the most...

295
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:38,883
...wonderful fucking thing in the world!

296
00:13:38,908 --> 00:13:42,267
And, yes, your entire
pelvic floor crumbles

297
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:46,052
and you get fucking hot
and no-one cares, but then...

298
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,824
...you're free.

299
00:13:49,184 --> 00:13:54,315
No longer a slave,
no longer a machine, with parts.

300
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:57,572
You're just a person in business.

301
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,464
Oh.

302
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:01,904
I was told it was horrendous.

303
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:04,624
It is horrendous,
but then it's magnificent.

304
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,185
Something to look forward to.

305
00:14:11,465 --> 00:14:13,064
You better get back to that party.

306
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:15,024
- Your party.
- Mm.

307
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:18,024
It is not a party
until someone flirts with you.

308
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,864
And that's the only really
shit thing about getting older,

309
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:23,584
is that people don't flirt
with you anymore.

310
00:14:23,585 --> 00:14:25,784
Not really. Not with danger.

311
00:14:25,785 --> 00:14:28,251
I miss walking into a room
and not knowing,

312
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:31,864
and there's a sort of energy, a dare.

313
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:34,253
Do not take that for granted.

314
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:39,620
There is nothing more exciting
than a room full of people.

315
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:42,144
Yeah, except most people are...

316
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:43,425
What?

317
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:46,505
...shit.

318
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:50,144
Look at me.

319
00:14:50,145 --> 00:14:52,544
Listen.

320
00:14:52,545 --> 00:14:54,505
People are all we've got.

321
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:57,840
People are all we've got.

322
00:14:57,865 --> 00:15:01,248
So grab the night by its nipples
and go and flirt with someone.

323
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:04,732
No, that's not what I meant!

324
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:11,424
Oh.

325
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:13,508
I wish you were my type.

326
00:15:14,545 --> 00:15:17,171
Take this tart back to my party

327
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:19,144
and go and find someone to
actually do that with.

328
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:20,744
- I want to do it with you.
- No.

329
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,749
- Why not?
- Honestly?

330
00:15:22,773 --> 00:15:23,929
Yeah.

331
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:25,744
I can't be arsed, darling.

332
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:29,601
I'm going to go back to my room
and have one more martini,

333
00:15:29,626 --> 00:15:32,570
and if you need anything, call me.

334
00:15:32,595 --> 00:15:33,875
Anything.

335
00:15:35,306 --> 00:15:37,985
You can have whoever
you want at your age.

336
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,449
Except the Best Woman in Business.

337
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:42,643
Well, that's just because
she's exhausted.

338
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:44,953
33 isn't exactly...

339
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:47,473
And what had Jesus done by 33?

340
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:48,953
- Died?
- Exactly!

341
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:50,634
So get out there and flirt.

342
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:02,929
- Here you are!
- Oh, hi!

343
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:04,334
Thought you might be snogging Finland.

344
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:07,313
Ha-ha! No, just sorting a few things!

345
00:16:07,314 --> 00:16:08,473
I got her!

346
00:16:08,474 --> 00:16:09,673
Oh!

347
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:11,393
And Belinda gave me her card.

348
00:16:11,394 --> 00:16:12,674
Oh, that's great!

349
00:16:13,794 --> 00:16:15,833
- What?
- Nothing.

350
00:16:15,834 --> 00:16:17,153
She's furious.

351
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:18,393
Really?

352
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,233
Yes! It was a great night.

353
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:23,903
Everything went smoothly in the end,
and everyone loved the canapes.

354
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:25,287
Really? I'm a dead woman.

355
00:16:25,312 --> 00:16:27,129
- Really?
