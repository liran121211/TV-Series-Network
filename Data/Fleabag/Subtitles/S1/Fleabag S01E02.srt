1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,479
I opened the cafe with my friend Boo.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,919
Yeah, she's dead now.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,840
My sister.
- I have two degrees, a husband and a Burberry coat.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,999
- I know what you were doing.
- I was watching the news.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,719
- Heard from Dad?
- Nope.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,999
All right, Dad?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,159
Dad's way of coping
with two motherless daughters

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,079
was to buy us tickets
to feminist lectures,

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,599
start fucking our godmother
and eventually stop calling.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,119
It's very valuable, actually.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,760
- How much?
- Thousands.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,359
Can I have it?

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,759
No.

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,959
Please don't contact me

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,399
or turn up at my house drunk
in your underwear.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,519
It won't work this time.

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,560
It will.

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,680
I think my period's coming.

19
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,919
OK.

20
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,959
Hi.

21
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,079
Are you all right? What's happened?
Are you hurt?

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,920
- No.
- Good.

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,799
Nice haircut.

24
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,920
It's better.

25
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,519
Can I come in?

26
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,039
Why didn't you text?

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,519
Well, I just thought I'd pop by.

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,599
- Tell the truth.
- I need to speak to Martin. - Martin?

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,159
Martin. Martin!
- Why on earth would you want to speak to...

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,279
Martin?
- Hello! Hello! My wife in my study! Hello!

31
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,759
Give me two.

32
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,959
Gang bangs, Asian,
I'd put a tenner on it.

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,479
Finished.

34
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,639
Well, hello, you.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,359
She wants to talk to you
about something.

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,199
Well, it must be my lucky day.

37
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,240
You said she only likes
to talk to people she fancies.

38
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,479
- Can you leave us?
- Why?

39
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,240
He's organising
your surprise birthday party.

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,359
You know I hate sur...

41
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,400
OK.

42
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,799
I have a week to organise that now.

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,039
Best of luck.

44
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,159
Nice top.

45
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,159
Thanks. Do you deal in sculptures
as well as paintings and papier mache?

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,240
Depends on the quality of the piece.

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,359
Fuck me!

48
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,720
- What a pair!
- I know, right?

49
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,719
Where d'you get this?

50
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,399
Just a...

51
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,879
Stole it from a market.

52
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,599
It's quite a piece.

53
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,439
Who's the artist?

54
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,079
Just a...

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,439
...market artist.

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,999
If I sell it, I take 10%.
Deal?

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,119
Deal.

58
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,759
OK, well,

59
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,759
I'll get her photographed now.

60
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,919
Don't tell Claire, please.

61
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,199
Or what?

62
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,439
Or I'll...

63
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,079
I'll...

64
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,160
You've got nothing on me, princess.

65
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,120
Or I'll tell her you were
watching gang bangs.

66
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,360
Please don't do that again.

67
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,480
I wasn't, by the way.

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,639
Disappointing.

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,999
Where did you get that?

70
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,199
I brought it with me.

71
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,439
No, you didn't.
Give it back.

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,239
Tight.

73
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,639
Patch things up with Harry?

74
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,519
Yeah, we're...

75
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,919
We're engaged, so...

76
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,079
God! What?

77
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,679
No, we're not engaged!

78
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,879
No, he's back at the flat
packing up all his stuff again.

79
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,679
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,919
He really...

81
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,919
...used to make you laugh.

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,199
He also used to say things like...

83
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,879
You're not like other girls.

84
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,239
You can...

85
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,280
...keep up.

86
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,439
I like Harry.

87
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,760
I liked his songs.

88
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,800
I admire how much Harry
commits to our break-ups.

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,279
I mean, this is a new detail,

90
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,239
but he does usually go
the extra mile.

91
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,040
A few times, he's even cleaned
the whole flat.

92
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,279
Like it's a crime scene.

93
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,879
I've considered timing a break-up

94
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,119
for when the flat needs
a bit of a going over.

95
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,200
I don't think this is working.

96
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,879
What?

97
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,880
But he always leaves...

98
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,199
...him

99
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,799
to come back for.

100
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,960
Got to think about all the people
I can have sex with now.

101
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,919
I'm not obsessed with sex,

102
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,639
I just can't stop thinking about it.

103
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,639
The performance of it.

104
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,559
The awkwardness of it.

105
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,639
The drama of it.

106
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,999
The moment you realise someone wants

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
your body.

108
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,920
Not so much the feeling of it.

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,440
Probably got about 48 hours
before Harry comes back.

110
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,120
I should get on it.

111
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,799
I took half an hour
trying to look nice

112
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,479
and I ended up looking amazing.

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,799
Just one of those days.

114
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,519
Gorgeous, fresh-faced,
new top, little bit sexy,

115
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,199
on my way to open my cafe and...

116
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,839
God.

117
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,159
Yeah, you check me out, chub-chub,

118
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,279
because it's never gonna happen.

119
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,839
God, he can't believe
how attractive I am.

120
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,639
Kind of worried I'm going to make
a sex offender out of the poor guy.

121
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,879
Here we go. This better be good.
Here we go.

122
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,280
Hooker slag.

123
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,320
Oi!

124
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,920
Dropped my cucumber.

125
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,680
Just dropped my...

126
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,199
Could I get
a cheese sandwich to go, please?

127
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,240
Sure.

128
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,599
That'll be £12.55, please.

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,199
London, eh?

130
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,400
Thanks.

131
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,120
Where do I recognise her?
Is she famous?

132
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,719
Boo's death hit the papers.

133
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,399
Local cafe girl gets hit by bike

134
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,439
and a car

135
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,319
and another bike.

136
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,439
No. She...
She used to work here.

137
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
I'm sorry, I don't have any change.

138
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,040
The next man who walks in here
is getting ridden to death.

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,639
- Dad!
- Hi.

140
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,919
Not ideal.

141
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,039
How are you,

142
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,480
darling?

143
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,199
You busy?

144
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,279
A bit.

145
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,720
Well, I won't keep you...

146
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,559
I just wanted to talk about,
you know, when you...

147
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,759
When you dropped in the other night.

148
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,079
- OK.
- I can't help thinking that I...

149
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,639
- We...
- Yeah?

150
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,000
I know that we...

151
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
...don't have much of a chance to...

152
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,919
Did you take the sculpture?

153
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,080
Did you...

154
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,999
...take the sculpture?

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,040
Did you take it?

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,159
No.

157
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,199
What sculpture?

158
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,119
Right, fine, good.

159
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,360
Good, you said no and...

160
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,639
...that means I can go.

161
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,920
All right, great.

162
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,399
Are you ha...
Are you healthy?

163
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,599
Hey. Do you do, like,
hot organic-y food?

164
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,159
Of course.

165
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,799
What would you like?

166
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,359
- Like, risotto.
- Yeah.

167
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,999
Sure.
Grab a seat.

168
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,000
Hey.

169
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,759
Hi.

170
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,119
Hey.

171
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,519
It's nice to see you.

172
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,879
You, too.

173
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,799
Fucked me up the arse.

174
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,319
What are you getting?

175
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,639
Just these.
For my...

176
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,520
...tiny, bleeding vagina.

177
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,679
Hot.

178
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,399
- You?
- Stock cubes.

179
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
Hot.

180
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,079
I hope it's a light flow.

181
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,799
It never is.

182
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,839
It never...

183
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,880
...is.

184
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,039
Listen,

185
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,919
you around later?

186
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,719
Yes, fucking yes, please, yes.

187
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,999
Yes.

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
Cool.

189
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,239
Yes!

190
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,159
I'm so happy with my body now.

191
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,399
I don't have to define myself
by how I look

192
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,999
because I've just got
a fucking great body.

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,239
- Yeah, I can do other stuff now!
- That's so great!

194
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,439
Mike wants to start
trying for a baby.

195
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,039
- OK.
- No...

196
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,959
I can't blow this body
on a baby, Steph.

197
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,880
I'm going to have to leave him.

198
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,439
Shit.

199
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,959
That is not hygienic.

200
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,199
- Sorry.
- Gross.

201
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,879
We're leaving now.

202
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,919
I suppose you should meet Hillary.

203
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,440
Two years ago, I...

204
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,559
OK. The most important thing is,
if you don't like it,

205
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,079
- we can't take it back, OK?
- OK.

206
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,199
Happy birthday.

207
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,799
I'm sorry, I panicked.

208
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,159
As long as I can wear it
or eat it, I'm happy.

209
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,999
You can do both of those things.

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,799
My God, did you get me a...

211
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,719
- What is this?
- I...

212
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,799
- What the... What is...
- I don't know.

213
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,839
- What is it?
- Something to love.

214
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,960
She's beautiful!

215
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,399
You idiot!

216
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,040
Escape artist.

217
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,279
I don't feel anything
about guinea pigs,

218
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,519
they're pointless,

219
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,879
but Boo took Hillary
very seriously as a gift

220
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,200
and, soon, everything
became guinea pig-related.

221
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,720
This is an excellent one.

222
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,360
Drink?

223
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,879
Look, I'm sorry about the mess.

224
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,959
No problem.

225
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,879
Do you want some prosciutto with that?

226
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,439
So reliable.

227
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,759
Utterly inaccessible.

228
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,439
Relentlessly profound.

229
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,479
All he wants is to get you
in the bath and ask questions like...

230
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,800
What are you afraid of?

231
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,719
And you find yourself
saying things like...

232
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,319
I guess...

233
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,200
...losing the currency of youth.

234
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,960
Ask me a question.

235
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,160
When did you realise
you were so good looking?

236
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,799
I knew I was different
when I was about nine,

237
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,919
but shit got real around 11.

238
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,319
Shit got real?

239
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,879
You know...

240
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,200
Aunts got weird.

241
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,039
I have another question.

242
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,080
OK.

243
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,640
Do you ever feel lonely?

244
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,799
Yeah.

245
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,599
Of course.

246
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,599
Do you?

247
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,760
Never.

248
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,880
Do you want some pineapple?

249
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,440
Yeah.

250
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,640
God, yeah!

251
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,879
They're so small!

252
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,239
They are so small!

253
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,079
- What?
- They're so small!

254
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,639
- So...
- Small!

255
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,719
God, they are so fucking tiny!

256
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,039
Yeah, I guess they're...

257
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,999
God, they're hardly even there!
I mean, what the fuck even are they?

258
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,839
Bit much.

259
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,240
Excuse me!

260
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,520
Yeah!

261
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,039
I'm having a Harry panic.

262
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,239
Madame Ovary's telling me
to run back to safe place,

263
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,919
I can make baby in safe place,

264
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,520
but you've got to ride it out.

265
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,160
Mustn't call Ha...

266
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,560
Thanks for coming.

267
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,399
That's OK.

268
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,879
Are you OK?

269
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,960
Your message sounded urgent.

270
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,839
Were you busy?

271
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,719
- No, I was in the interval...
- Cool.

272
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,999
- ...of Cats.
- OK. - The musical.

273
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,039
Was it good?

274
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,479
Really good, actually.

275
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,520
Really good.

276
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,319
- Sorry for interrupting.
- No, that's OK.

277
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,599
I...I got the feeling
it wasn't going to end well for the cats,

278
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,400
so probably good to remember them
like that before they all...

279
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,279
Sorry...

280
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,320
Are you OK?

281
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,079
Who were you with?

282
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,320
A work friend.

283
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,040
A girl.

284
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,560
I...

285
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,120
I found this.

286
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,559
Thanks.

287
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,200
I didn't realise I'd left it.

288
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,880
Why's your hair wet?

289
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,519
Don't look at me like that.

290
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,639
Like what? Like what?

291
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,919
Look, I don't want to sound cold
or cruel or... You know...

292
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,319
And I don't want to think
I'm just off happy at the theatre

293
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,679
all the time, either, I'm not,

294
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,359
but...

295
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,199
I'm not going to... I just...

296
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,759
If this is about us getting
back together, I was serious,

297
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,959
this time I'm not just going
to come running back.

298
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,280
I really just need
some time away from...

299
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,599
I'm so glad you called.

300
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,040
I'm so glad you picked up.

301
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,800
I've missed you.

302
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,200
I've missed you.

303
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,360
My gosh, you feel good.

304
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,239
I wish he'd just fuck me.

305
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,199
All he wants to do is make love.

306
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,239
Are you OK?

307
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,360
Yeah, I'm really good.
I'm amazing.

308
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,799
He's wasting me.

309
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,879
I was once fucking this guy
who would breathe on every thrust...

310
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,359
You're so young!

311
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,199
I masturbate about that all the time.

312
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,839
I masturbate a lot these days.

313
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,440
Especially when I'm bored.

314
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,079
Or angry.

315
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,239
Or upset.

316
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,359
Can we just...

317
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,959
Or happy.

318
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,359
Yeah.

319
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,599
Yeah.

320
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,880
Amazing.

321
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,719
- Shall I?
- No, could you just...

322
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,079
Just stay there.

323
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,079
No, don't. Just...

324
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,519
Yeah.

325
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,399
Yes. Just...

326
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,999
Just...

327
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,120
God.

328
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,560
Look, I think we should
stop masturbating.

329
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,439
And don't say anything yet, I just...

330
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,519
I just think it might help us
focus on each other.

331
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,159
You know, be more present.

332
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
Really successful couples do it.

333
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,159
I've hidden our vibrators.

334
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,199
Our?

335
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,639
I thought it might be fun.

336
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,879
To find them?

337
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,640
No, just to try and not...

338
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,039
...touch ourselves, to try and...

339
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,359
...save our touches...

340
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,239
...for each other.
I mean, what do you think?

341
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,199
Well, I think
you're being really sexy.

342
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,759
- Don't!
- I'm joking.

343
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,839
I never masturbate.

344
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,920
I don't know how.

345
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,279
Yeah, also, I thought we should try
and surprise each other

346
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,439
once every day, just a, you know...

347
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,759
A sweet little something,
just to keep it...

348
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,039
- You know?
- Are you getting this out of a book?

349
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,719
I've already planned
your first surprise, so...

350
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,440
Don't eat too much before dinner.

351
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,080
See you later.

352
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,120
And I will see you later, too.

353
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,559
Hi.

354
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,159
Just thought I'd pop by
for some lunch.

355
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,519
Bit weird.

356
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,920
Yes, well...

357
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,159
How are you?

358
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,799
Quiet day?

359
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,159
Yeah, I'm fine.

360
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,879
You OK?
You look stressed.

361
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,240
Well, I'm successful, so...

362
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,639
Do you have rye bread?

363
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,399
No, but I have some normal bread
you can puke up after.

364
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,199
Great.

365
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,479
What do you want on it?

366
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,999
Just tomatoes is fine.

367
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,719
Just tomatoes?

368
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,679
Just a tomato sandwich?

369
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,679
Yes.
Is there a problem?

370
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,960
No.

371
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,559
Listen, I don't want to know
anything about this surprise party,

372
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,519
but, if you could just,

373
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,679
have it at mine this Friday at 7:30,
that'd be great.

374
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,239
I can organise it and act surprised

375
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,319
but, if you could just...

376
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,319
Do you know what,
why don't I just do it?

377
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,199
I can organise it,
do the food, act surprised,

378
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,079
and just take it off your hands.

379
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,039
I mean, I can see that you're busy, so...
- OK, if you want.

380
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:15,039
Well, I don't want to, but I think
it would be easier for everyone

381
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,479
- if I could just...
- OK.

382
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,879
I mean, I've done it, it's done.

383
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,880
It's this Friday at 7:30 at mine.

384
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,000
Great.

385
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,159
How behind are you?

386
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,919
If it's money that you need...

387
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,199
I don't need money.

388
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,760
That'll be £25, please.

389
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,000
London...

390
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,399
Thanks.

391
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,199
Can't believe
that thing's still alive.

392
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,679
Any news on Harry?

393
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,239
Yeah, we're back together.

394
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,680
God, I can't keep up.

395
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,280
Hello!

396
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,480
Harry?

397
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,519
Shit.

398
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,999
Surprise, surprise,
surprise, surprise.

399
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,719
Surprise!

400
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,999
It's me! It's me! It's me!

401
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,359
Why would you do that?
I thought I was going to get raped!

402
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,199
I'm sorry! Baby, I'm sorry!
I thought you wanted a surprise!

403
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,519
It was a ninja surprise!

404
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,719
My God, my heart!

405
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,520
I'm shaking so much!
My God!

406
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:26,319
- My God! -
- My God!

407
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,279
OK. It's OK.
Are you OK?

408
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,719
My God.

409
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,359
Did you have a good day?

410
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,839
I did, yeah. Fine, thanks.
I'm so sorry.

411
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,879
I'm sorry. I didn't think
you were going to react like that.

412
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,399
I'm...

413
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,199
I'm sorry, it was a joke.

414
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,840
It was a good joke.

415
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,759
Jesus.

416
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,839
I thought you'd be later.

417
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,159
My God!

418
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,199
God, sorry!
I just had to get that out!

419
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,120
I'm still in shock!
I'm still shaking!

420
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,399
That was horrible.

421
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,759
It was a surprise.

422
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,999
I know.

423
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,119
Thank you.

424
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,320
It's fine.

425
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,279
Shall I go and get us some wine?

426
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,640
OK.

427
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,039
I know what you look like!

428
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,399
I know what you took!

429
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,200
That is the last time!

430
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,520
Splashed out on a special bottle
for a special...

431
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,960
Harry?

432
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,759
I had to go into the history
on my computer

433
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,480
to find something I'd seen
on the H&M website this morning and...

434
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,759
I don't want to point fingers but...

435
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,719
...anal, gang bang,

436
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,719
mature, big cock,

437
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,879
small tits, hentai,

438
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,599
Asian, teen,

439
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,559
MILF, big butts,

440
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,959
lesbian, gay,

441
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,239
facial, fetish,

442
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,119
bukake, young and old,

443
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,199
swallow, rough, voyeur

444
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,520
and public.

445
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,520
Why are you being so sexy?

446
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,720
Don't make me hate you.

447
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,600
Loving you's painful enough.

448
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,520
OK, sorry...

449
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,559
...but I really think
you should write that down.

450
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,519
I know it's not appropriate
but I really think

451
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,559
you should write that down.
It's really good...

452
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,559
- I'm not going to write down...
- No, I'm serious!

453
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,159
For your songs and stuff.
It's perfect! It's poetic yet real.

454
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,200
Serious.

455
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,319
Don't...

456
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,799
...make me...

457
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,199
- Hate you.
- Yeah, I know, thank you.

458
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Loving you is painful...

459
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,840
What am I doing?

460
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,199
Look, there's someone at work
who loves me.

461
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,039
Well, she told me she loves me
and I said we couldn't be together

462
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,440
because I had to know.

463
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,520
Do you want to be alone?

464
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,640
You will never see me again.

465
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,479
I'll always love you
but I just can't take it any more.

466
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,200
I don't hate you, I'm scared for you.

467
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,360
He's going to write that down.

468
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,399
Don't hate you...

469
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,440
Scared...

470
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,159
I'm going to go pack my things up
from the bedroom again, but...

471
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,079
I'm... I'm not going to clean.

472
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,960
It's still in pretty
good shape, so...

473
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,879
If I don't see you after that,

474
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,920
goodbye.

475
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,320
Forever.

476
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,960
He'll be back.
