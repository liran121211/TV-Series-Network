1
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,399
You know that feeling when a guy
you like sends you a text

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,239
at two o'clock on a Tuesday night
asking if he can come and find you,

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,239
and you've accidentally made it out
like you've just got in yourself,

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,679
so you have to get out of bed,
drink wine, get in the shower,

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,279
shave everything, dig out some
Agent Provocateur business -

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,639
suspender belt, the whole bit -

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,439
and wait by the door
until the buzzer goes?

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,519
And then you open the door to him,

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,719
like you've almost forgotten
he's coming over.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,320
- Hi.
- Hey.

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,160
Hey.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,680
Hey.

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,359
And then you get to it immediately.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,160
After some pretty standard bouncing,
you realise...

15
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,879
...he's edging towards your arsehole.

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,319
But you're drunk

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,479
and he made the effort to come
all the way here,

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,720
so you let him.
He's thrilled.

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,440
I'm so thrilled.

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,039
And then the next morning,
you wake to find him...

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,040
fully dressed, sat on the side of
the bed, gazing at you.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,479
- He says that...
- Last night was incredible.

23
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,799
Which you think is an overstatement,
but then he goes on to say that...

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
It was
particularly special because...

25
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,960
...I've never managed to actually...

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
...up the bum with anyone before.

27
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,399
To be fair, he does have
a large penis.

28
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,079
And although it's always been
a fantasy of mine, I've...

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,200
never found anyone
I could do it with.

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,080
And then he touches your hair...

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,120
...and thanks you with
a genuine, earnest...

32
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,400
Thank you.

33
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,439
It's sort of moving.

34
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,960
Then he kisses you gently.

35
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,880
And then he leaves.

36
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,760
And you spend the rest of the day
wondering...

37
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,440
Do I have a massive arsehole?

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,679
This doesn't happen
very often, does it?

39
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,199
No.

40
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,679
I su...

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,239
I suppose it's...

42
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,799
It's quite rare, yeah.

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,120
I hate myself.

44
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,599
Are you going to work?

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,319
- No, actually...
- OK, this is going to sound crazy

46
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,319
but I think that I should
take your number

47
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,599
and I think I should call it,

48
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,160
and I think I should ask you if you
want to go out for a drink with me.

49
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,199
Fuck me!
You've got a boyfriend?

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,999
No...

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,839
No, we broke up quite recently,
actually.

52
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,639
My God.
I'm so sorry/really pleased.

53
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,480
How the hell did he manage to fuck
that up?

54
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,840
'Power rarely gives up
without a fight...

55
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,519
'..particularly in places where
there are divisions of tribe,

56
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,560
'divisions of sect.

57
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,719
'We also know that populism can
take dangerous turns.

'And there will be difficult days

00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,999
'From the extremism of those who

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,239
'to deny minority rights

61
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,880
- What are you doing?
- Nothing!

62
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,599
Harry!

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,280
- I know what you were doing.
- I was watching the news.

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,800
- Really?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,879
Really?

66
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,920
Yeah.

67
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,839
What was he talking about, then?

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,279
- What?
- Please, I just need to hear this.

69
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,800
What was he talking about?

70
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,480
Iraq.

71
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,960
Don't say anything.

72
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,040
And please don't stop me leaving.

73
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,519
- Please don't!
- OK.

74
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,680
Don't!

75
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,199
Look, I've really tried to be there
for you through this.

76
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,519
You can't say I haven't tried.

77
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,919
Don't say anything.
And please don't contact me

78
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,079
or turn up at my house drunk in your
underwear. It won't work this time.

79
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,120
It will.

80
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,760
I'm taking that posh shampoo.

81
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,960
He was talking about democ...

82
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,520
He was just...

83
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,639
...really kind and supportive
with my work.

84
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,359
He'd cook all the time,
run baths, hoover.

85
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,239
He'd laugh at all of my jokes.

86
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,799
He was really great with my family,
my friends loved him.

87
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,879
Plus, he was really
fucking affectionate.

88
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,879
- Sounds like a dickhead.
- Yeah.

89
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,519
So, was that, like, "You CAN have my
number," or...? What are we...?

90
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,879
Yes. Yeah, I guess that's a yes.

91
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,799
My gosh. Great...

92
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,840
OK.

93
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,160
Put that in there.

94
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,880
And I'll be sure to treat you
like a nasty little bitch.

95
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,719
- That was a joke.
- No, I know.

96
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,679
- I know!
- OK. I was, like, "Oh!"

97
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,519
OK. Great!

98
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,159
I'll buzz you, then?

99
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,919
- OK.
- OK.

100
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,960
OK.

101
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,199
I can't stop smiling.
Sorry, I...

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,599
It's OK.

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,120
I'll go.

104
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,679
Thank you for coming in today.

105
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,119
We really appreciate you
considering us

106
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,359
for your small business
start-up loan.

107
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,879
No problem.

108
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,319
I've read your application form.

109
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,279
- Thank you.
- It was...

110
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,640
funny.

111
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,319
OK, that wasn't my intention, but...

112
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,079
As you are probably aware,

113
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,519
we haven't had the opportunity
to support many -

114
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,999
any - women-led businesses
since the...

115
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,999
Sexual harassment case.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,079
The sexual harassment case.

117
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,120
Yes.

118
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,679
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, sorry. I just...

119
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,279
I ran from the station,
so I'm just a bit hot.

120
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,479
- I'm really excited about...
- Water?

121
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,919
No, thanks. I'm fine.

122
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,119
Actually, yeah, water would be
great. If I could...

123
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,159
Sure. There are a couple of details
that we need to iron out,

124
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,839
and one or two bits and pieces I'm
going to need to see some more on.

125
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,079
It says in here

126
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,240
that you opened a business
with your partner...

127
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,119
OK.

128
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,919
I'm sorry, that kind of thing won't
get you very far here any more.

129
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,879
No, sorry. I thought I had
a top on underneath.

130
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,959
Yeah, OK.
- No, seriously. In this case, genuine accident.

131
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,159
I can see, given our history,
why you might think...

132
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,359
No! Seriously, I wasn't trying to.
I was hot.

133
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,119
I take this kind of thing
very seriously.

134
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,360
I'm not trying to shag you!
Look at yourself!

135
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,920
OK.

136
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,319
Please leave.

137
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,759
No, you don't understand.
I NEED this...

138
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,160
- I need this loan.
- Please, just leave.

139
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,919
- Perv.
- Slut.

140
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,640
'The lecture will
commence shortly.'

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,719
My sister. She's uptight and
beautiful and probably anorexic,

142
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,359
but clothes look awesome
on her, so...

143
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,999
You're almost late.

144
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,399
Had to do a flash poo in Pret.

145
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,279
Christ.
Did you wash your hands?

146
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,360
Of course not.

147
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,599
My God! You are disgusting!
Fucking hell.

148
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,000
Of course I washed my hands. It's
not like I grew up without a mother.

149
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
- Heard from Dad?
- No.

150
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,639
Dad's way of coping with two
motherless daughters

151
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,519
was to buy us tickets to
feminist lectures,

152
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,160
start fucking our godmother
and eventually stop calling.

153
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,600
You look tired.
- Thanks. I've been sleeping really well recently.

154
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,120
Shit!

155
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:01,199
I'm wearing the top that she "lost"
years ago, so...

156
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,119
this is going to be tense.

157
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,679
- Do you want to take your coat off?
- No.

158
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,720
OK.

159
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,040
Sorry. Thanks.

160
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,279
So, any luck...

161
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,679
- God, can we just have two seconds...
- I was going to ask

162
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,799
- about the cafe.
- I don't want to talk about it yet.

163
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,320
- We won't talk, then.
- Fine.

164
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
- Hair looks nice.
- Fuck off.

165
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,719
The only thing harder than having
to tell your super-high-powered,

166
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,559
perfect, anorexic,
rich super-sister

167
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,839
that you've run out of money

168
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,800
is having to ask her
to bail you out.

169
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,080
I'm just going to ask her.

170
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,559
I'm just going to ask her.

171
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,799
I'm just going to ask her.
I'm just going to come...

172
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,239
- Do you need to borrow money?
- No!

173
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,039
I can't do it. I can't do it,
I can't do it.

174
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,159
I can't do it.

175
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,919
- So business is good, then?
- Yeah.

176
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,159
It's good.
It's really good.

177
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,719
It's really, really good.
Yeah, it's really good.

178
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,879
Sounds like it's really good.

179
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,040
It is.

180
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

181
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,200
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thanks, I'm good.

182
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,639
Are you sure I can't get you
anything at all?

183
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,479
Is Harry helping?

184
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,159
We broke up.

185
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,839
What? Again?!

186
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,039
If you see him, I'm a wreck, OK?

187
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,239
God! Just don't get drunk and scream
through his letterbox again.

188
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,199
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

189
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,519
Don't get drunk
and shit in your sink again.

190
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,639
When are you going to stop
bringing that up?

191
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,359
When you do something better.

192
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,279
I have two degrees, a husband
and a Burberry coat.

193
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,759
You shat in a sink.

194
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,400
- Hi.
- Thank you. - No problem.

195
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,000
Nothing is ever going to be better.

196
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,799
I swear there are pants
that give you thrush.

197
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,040
What are yours made from?

198
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,600
Don't know.

199
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,039
I need to get sexy pants.

200
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,359
I hate my body, I hate my body,
I hate my body, I hate my body.

201
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,359
Fucking last-minute
bastard trendy parties.

202
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,400
Why do we do it to ourselves?

203
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,119
My God. Definitely not.
That does nothing for you.

204
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,280
I hate that.

205
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,719
What?

206
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
These are MY clothes, Boo.
I've been wearing these all day.

207
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,199
Oh, God.

208
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,519
Were you wearing your coat?

209
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,040
Yes. But...

210
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,599
Nothing here looked nice,

211
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,639
so I thought I'd wear
what I was wearing anyway.

212
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,959
Are you joking?

213
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,679
Are YOU joking?

214
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,840
Yes.

215
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,479
- My...
- It's not really that bad at all.

216
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,279
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I love you.

217
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,479
I'll buy...
- I've got to get a whole new outfit now.

218
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,679
I'll buy you pants.

219
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,119
- I'll buy you sexy pants.
- I've been so many places today!

220
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,399
- I'll buy you sexy pants!
- Fuck off.

221
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,640
I'm sorry.
I think it's a lovely dress.

222
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,079
I mean, you really shouldn't
wear such cheap materials.

223
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,080
They don't let your fanny breathe.

224
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,959
I know.

225
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,800
Gosh, look at you all.

226
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,519
Thank you so much
for coming to Women Speak,

227
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,279
opening women's mouths since 1998.

228
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,760
Before we begin, I would like
to ask you a question.

229
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,439
I don't know about you...

230
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,199
but I need some reassurance.

231
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,120
So I pose the question
to the women in this room today.

232
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,080
Please raise your hands...

233
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,639
...if you would trade...

234
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,560
five years of your life...

235
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,439
...for the so-called perfect body.

236
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,760
(We are bad feminists.)

237
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,120
- I want my top back.
- OK.

238
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,560
- Won't you get cold?
- Nah, I've got really hairy nipples.

239
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,120
What?

240
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,039
- Fuck!
- Fuck! What was that?

241
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,999
- Jesus!
- A fucking hug!

242
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,679
Well, why the fuck did you do that?

243
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,759
That's terrifying.
Never do that again.

244
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,080
I was just trying to...

245
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,880
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

246
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,439
Do you want to go
for a drink, or...?

247
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,719
- I've got plans.
- OK, fine. Sure.

248
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,680
See you next time,
Women Speak, then.

249
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,640
Do you want to go for a drink?

250
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,039
My sister blows glass.
She has done for a long time.

251
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,359
I've never been in a fight.

252
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,919
Well, I've been in a fight.
Never been punched in the face.

253
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,279
I've been punched in the leg.

254
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,439
And someone once threw
some punch in my face.

255
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,239
So, my colours this season
are sort of brown, mainly.

256
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,479
But, like, you know,
I wouldn't say no to a maroon.

257
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,719
I wouldn't, like, jump down
the throat of someone

258
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,839
wearing something blue.
It's just not for me.

259
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,999
So...

260
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,120
I'm going to go for a wazz.
You... OK.

261
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,199
Same again, while I'm up?
Or perhaps, like, a little cocky-tail?

262
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,559
Or, like, a nice shot?

263
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,999
Yeah, or we could
just go back to mine.

264
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,439
Thanks.

265
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,959
I've actually got work tomorrow,
but, another drink here...

266
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,279
- Or we could go back to yours.
- Got to be up really early.

267
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,879
- I'll get you a cab in the morning.
- That's ridiculous! My God!

268
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,800
OK, what the fuck is your problem?

269
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,719
Nothing.

270
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,719
I... I like you.

271
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,759
OK, you're a dick.

272
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,160
What's going on?

273
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,440
You're pathetic.

274
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,399
- Wait...
- Don't follow me.

275
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,440
I wasn't.

276
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,320
You dropped this.

277
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,320
OK.

278
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,320
Come on.

279
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,680
Are you OK?

280
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,560
Are YOU OK?

281
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,120
Sad face.

282
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,199
I'm fine.

283
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,960
You're such a lovely man.

284
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
- OK.
- Thank you.

285
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,080
Stay there, stay there.
You OK?

286
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,879
OK.

287
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,960
Hey.

288
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,439
Do you... Do you want
to come home with me?

289
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,639
What?!

290
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,839
No way!

291
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,999
You naughty boy.

292
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,119
Ooh! Sing a song, Boo-Boo.

293
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,519
Another lunch break
another portion

294
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,759
Another piece of cake

295
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,759
Another two
Fuck it - 20

296
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,719
Cigarettes

297
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,199
And we're happy

298
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,799
So happy

299
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,280
To be modern women.

300
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,960
Hey, come here.

301
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,200
Let's never ask anyone for anything.
They don't get it.

302
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,080
- Deal.
- Deal.

303
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,959
Fuck it.

304
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,000
This is totally fine.

305
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,320
Hello. Open!

306
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,120
All right, Dad?

307
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,640
What's going on?

308
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,880
I'm... I'm absolutely fine.

309
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,040
OK.

310
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,840
I just...

311
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,560
Yeah?

312
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,080
It's nothing.
It doesn't...

313
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,560
It's...
- You know, it's nearly two o'clock in the morning.

314
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,160
OK.

315
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,919
Yeah, OK. I'm...
I don't want to...

316
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,399
I'm going to...

317
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,799
It was...

318
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,959
Fuck it.

319
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,959
I have a horrible feeling that
I'm a greedy, perverted, selfish,

320
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,559
apathetic, cynical, depraved,

321
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,280
morally bankrupt woman,
who can't even call herself a feminist.

322
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,960
Well...

323
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,520
You get all that from your mother.

324
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,079
Good one.

325
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,879
I'm going to call you
a cab, darling.

326
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,799
And...

327
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,200
please don't go upstairs.

328
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,880
To be fair, she's not
an evil stepmother.

329
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,560
She's just a cunt.

330
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,400
Hi.

331
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,359
Darling, I thought that must be you.

332
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,119
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, I just thought I'd swing by.

333
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,239
How lovely. Lucky us.

334
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,920
Don't worry - Dad's already
booking me a taxi.

335
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,759
What are you doing?

336
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,639
Painting.
I find the night-times very...

337
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,759
peaceful.
Usually.

338
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,480
Warming up.

339
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,799
Look, I know it's not really
my place, but are you OK?

340
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,319
- Everyone's been really worried.
- Poor fucker.

341
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,959
Yes, she's actually an expression
of how women are subtle warriors.

342
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,119
Strong at heart.

343
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,559
We don't have to use muscular force
to get what we want.

344
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,359
- We just use our...
- Tits.

345
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,160
...innate femininity.

346
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,639
Tits don't get you anywhere
these days.

347
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,680
Trust me.

348
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,399
It's very valuable, actually.

349
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,359
- How much?
- Thousands.

350
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,479
Can I have it?

351
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,400
No.

352
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,919
What's that?

353
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,600
my self-portrait.

354
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,920
- 'Right, it's here.'
- I think I can hear your dad.

355
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,919
'Cab's here!'

356
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,840
- Thanks!
- Nice of him.

357
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,079
OK.

358
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,320
- Bye.
- Bye.

359
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,079
Please look after yourself.

360
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,560
You really do look ghastly, darling.

361
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,120
- Cafe?
- Yeah.

362
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,800
On your own?

363
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,959
Kind of.

364
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,679
Kind of? Go on.

365
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,079
It's... It's quite
a funny story, actually.

366
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,399
No, that's good.
It'll keep me going.

367
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,440
Shoot.

368
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,119
- I opened the cafe with my friend Boo.
- Cute name. - Yeah.

369
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,679
Yeah, she's dead now.
She accidentally killed herself.

370
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,319
Wasn't her intention,
but it wasn't a total accident.

371
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,319
She didn't actually think she'd die.
She just...

372
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,999
found out that her boyfriend
fucked someone else

373
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,679
and wanted to punish him
by ending up in hospital,

374
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,639
not letting him visit her for a bit.

375
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,119
She decided to walk
into a busy cycle lane,

376
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,199
wanting to get tangled in a bike -
break a finger, maybe.

377
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,879
As it turns out, bikes go fast
and flip you into the road.

378
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,160
Three people died.
She was such a dick.

379
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,160
So, yeah.
Kind of on my own.
