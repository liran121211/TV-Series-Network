1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,599
- I know I seem mental, but I'm fine.
- OK.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,999
- How's everything at the cafe?
- You really don't have to.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,359
I got the Finland promotion.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,879
- That's amazing!
- Thank you.

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,919
- I'm turning it down.
- What?

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,799
One of my pieces has gone missing.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,359
You must have bent over backwards
to get something like that.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,400
Who's the artist?

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:22,639
I stole that sculpture
from a certain somebody's studio.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,999
Mum died three years ago.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,599
She had a double mastectomy,
but never really recovered.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,159
Don't let other people get in
the way of what you really want.

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,759
My husband isn't other people, OK?

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,719
My husband is my life!

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,399
Your husband tried to kiss me
on your birthday.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,680
Did he?

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,240
Have you seen my sister?!

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,159
I mean, we're all being very
grown-up about this, but...

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,119
Let me know if you feel
any discomfort.

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,680
No, it's lovely, thank you.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,359
Your father informed me
of your family history.

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,119
Yeah, evil boobs everywhere.

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,440
Arm up, please.

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,120
Stop it!

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,920
I'm sorry, I'm just ticklish.

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,799
Examined your sister this morning.

27
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,599
Did you? Does she...

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,400
Is she all right? Did she seem all right?
- Yes. Why?

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,560
Just... can't get hold of her.

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,279
She seemed very busy.

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,079
Sure.

32
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,999
Dad books us boob appointments
once a year,

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,679
to make sure our tits don't turn
on us like Mum's did.

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,639
It's a bit of a hassle
but, at the end of the day,

35
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,040
it's nice to be touched.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,319
Bet you look forward
to seeing Claire.

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,719
A lot more to touch,
if you know what I mean.

38
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,759
I'm sorry. It's just...
there are worse jobs.

39
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,800
Look...

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,759
I check for cancerous lumps
in mammary glands.

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,799
Now, any pleasure I derive from that
is entirely dependent upon whether

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,120
or not I am about to save your life.

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,880
Of course, Doctor.

44
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,200
You can put your clothes back on.

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,839
Hey!

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,079
She's here.
- I've been waiting out here for nearly 10 minutes.

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,239
Yeah, you left me on
a fucking Silent Hill.

48
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,519
Yes, well, I had to.
Did you get back OK?

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,879
God, this is so stressful.

50
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,959
Mum's memorial lunch.

51
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,559
I should have worn my other coat.

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,319
Visiting Dad is hell for Claire.

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,799
I see it more as a sport.

54
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,839
It's so inappropriate
that she should be here.

55
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,439
- Have you spoken to Martin?
- No, it's fine. Everything's fine.

56
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,759
- Everything's totally fine.
- It sounds like it's fine.

57
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,399
Can you please just give me
some space?

58
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,200
You're standing so close to me!

59
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,879
- Ready?
- No.

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,280
Don't tell Dad about Finland.
And don't provoke her.

61
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,560
Let's just get out of this alive, OK?

62
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,199
Girls.

63
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,079
Got to hand it to her. Hi.

64
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,839
You shouldn't have.

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,399
They're actually for Dad.

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,799
Are they freesias?

67
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,799
Yeah, they were sort of
a favourite of...

68
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,759
Gosh, how special.

69
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,400
How lovely.
Aren't they stunning?

70
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,360
Aw, let's just leave them...

71
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,799
...there.

72
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,119
Lovely.

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,160
Come in.

74
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,759
Who's Dad sawing in half?

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,759
- Just the tree.
- Sorry?

76
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,119
The tree in the back garden.

77
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,719
Why are you taking the tree down?

78
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,639
Felicity tried to use it
to get out.

79
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,239
She's very expensive.

80
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,839
This is nice.

81
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,919
Thank you.

82
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,400
This is beautiful!

83
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,119
I hope you don't mind my being here,
but my Pilates fell through, so...

84
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,799
- Of course.
- No, it's lovely.

85
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,959
It's a sad day.

86
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,759
A sad, sad day.

87
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,159
I'll get the champagne.

88
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,200
This is my favourite bit.

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,679
I wonder who's going to...

90
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,319
That's a lovely cushion.

91
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,480
Thanks. It's an original.

92
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,800
Gosh.

93
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,919
I love your hat.

94
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,639
It's a hair scarf.

95
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,239
Looks like a hat.

96
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,720
Well, it's a hair scarf.

97
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,920
OK.

98
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,359
- Is Martin coming?
- No.

99
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,400
He's away.

100
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
I'm very excited to meet
your new chap.

101
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,159
Is he...

102
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,759
No, he's a different one.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,240
You do turn over fast!

104
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,239
Dad will come in with some weird
canapes in a second.

105
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,760
Girls!

106
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,759
- Hello.
- Hi.

107
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,559
- Hi.
- Hello... yeah.

108
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,359
Sorry about all that noise.

109
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,439
You got a drink?

110
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,639
Sorry.

111
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,800
I forgot your glass.

112
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,679
You're both looking
very healthy, very...

113
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,040
very good and healthy and...

114
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,840
Did you talk to Dr Samuels
about your...?

115
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,239
Yes.

116
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,920
And they're happy, getting along...

117
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,439
...all right?

118
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,159
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. Great.

119
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,200
Good. Excellent.

120
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,960
You are my...

121
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,239
...daughters.

122
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,199
- Yep.
- Yes.

123
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,640
Yeah, we are.

124
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,319
Sit down.

125
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,599
I think I should say a few words
about your mother.

126
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,799
Ignore me.
Ignore me, ignore me.

127
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,639
This day is not an easy one.

128
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,719
Cheers.

129
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,679
To Mum.

130
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,639
To Margaret.

131
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,559
Dearest Margaret.

132
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,919
Just the most generous woman.

133
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,320
- Yeah, well, she certainly was...
- Yeah, she was great.

134
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,359
It was...

135
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,399
It was the voice she used...

136
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,879
for the pigeons.

137
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,559
She always made
them sound so rude, you know?

138
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,439
But very, very funny.

139
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,239
She used to take the girls
around the park and point at the...

140
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,439
The squirrel voices were the best.

141
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,879
Run...!

142
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,319
- Run! Fucking run!
- Run-run-run-run-run!

143
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,439
Run-run-run-run!

144
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,879
Yes, yes, my ex had a similar thing -

145
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,639
voices and fun.

146
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,679
Really, really funny man.

147
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,000
Really funny.

148
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,959
Can I help you with the food?

149
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,319
Yes, yes, I should...

150
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,560
And take that off.

151
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,759
So, are you going to Finland?

152
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,960
You're going to have
to talk to me eventually.

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,559
Plaits.

154
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,199
Either she's got her period
or some serious shit's gone down.

155
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,999
She always does something slightly
different around her period.

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,079
She gets really bad PMT.

157
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,159
Mum used to call it
her monthly confidence crisis.

158
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,599
But it's PMT.

159
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,119
The only way she can get through it
is to reinvent herself

160
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,200
in some small way.

161
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,799
What?

162
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,359
I'm doing a wee on this cushion.

163
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,400
What?!

164
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,240
I sort of wish you were.

165
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,239
What are you doing?

166
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,239
Just put it back
where you got it from, OK?

167
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,039
- No!
- Just do it.

168
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,159
I don't want it in my house.

169
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,599
I'm doing you a massive favour.

170
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,679
She could really go to town
on you for this.

171
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,400
Come on, what's she going to do?
Draw me?

172
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,319
- Go.
- No.

173
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,399
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK...

174
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,760
Jesus!

175
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,360
Why are we sneaking?

176
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,240
- We're not allowed upstairs.
- Of course we are.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,119
God...

178
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,319
I keep forgetting
that she's actually talented.

179
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,840
I know, it's infuriating.

180
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,000
Go on, then.

181
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,519
Where's her head?

182
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,999
She's got your boobs -
she doesn't need one.

183
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
OK...

184
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,679
OK. Hey...

185
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,319
Is everything OK?

186
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
With Martin?

187
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,519
You've invited someone today?

188
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,199
Yeah. Yeah, he's horrifically hot -

189
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,479
you're going to puke
when you see him.

190
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,679
Are you on your period?

191
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,679
- Why would you ask that?
- The plaits.

192
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,920
- No reason.
- Say it. - The plaits.

193
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,399
Hey...

194
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,759
Do you think she's ever
painted Dad naked?

195
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,520
I think you should take your nose
out of other people's marriages.

196
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,559
Sneaking a preview, are we?

197
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,799
Sorry, I spilled my champagne and...

198
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,000
I got distracted on my way
to the bathroom.

199
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,120
Me too.

200
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,839
It's really beautiful work.

201
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,959
Thank you.

202
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,159
Let me show you to the loo.

203
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,599
That's all right.

204
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,079
I grew up in this house.

205
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,680
It's all changed now, though.

206
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,039
Your father's in the kitchen.

207
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,199
Great.

208
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,600
I'll go and torment him.

209
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,759
He hates being alone
in a room with me.

210
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,800
Watch this.

211
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,599
Hi, Dad.

212
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,560
I just need some...

213
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,679
- Just need...
- What do you need? - I need some...

214
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,359
salt.

215
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,439
There it is.

216
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,040
Here it is, yeah.

217
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,240
So...

218
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,160
...how are you, darling?

219
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,479
Have you got enough...

220
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,759
clothes?

221
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,919
I can never have enough clothes.

222
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,479
And how is the cafe?

223
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,799
Well, the lease is up
in a couple of days, and...

224
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,439
I don't think I can
really afford to...

225
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,839
I think I'm just going to
have to... accept that it's...

226
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,199
I'm sorry about that, darling.

227
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,199
But, of course, we're just a little bit
tight on the purse strings, too.

228
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,839
No,
I wasn't asking you for any...

229
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,559
We've just been keeping it quiet.
We haven't been able to...

230
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,800
to buy anything or do anything,
and...

231
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,799
What's that?

232
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,399
That? That's just a...

233
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,079
tiny little house we're...

234
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
we're buying in...

235
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,520
...in France.

236
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,959
Lovely.

237
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,879
Yeah. I...

238
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,560
I just wanted to talk to you...

239
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,079
...about this exhibition.

240
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,600
What exhibition?

241
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,239
- No!
- Jesus, Dad! Again?

242
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,279
No, it doesn't...
Pick it up, pick it up!

243
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,959
Help me pick these up.
Please, please!

244
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,439
She mustn't see it.

245
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,999
- She mustn't find out.
- OK, OK...

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,399
Five second rule.

247
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,559
No, I have never bought
into that rule.

248
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,600
It's disgusting.

249
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,279
What are you doing?

250
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,919
Just a little family tradition.

251
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,679
What odd fun.
What are the rules?

252
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,000
Thank God.
That'll be your man.

253
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,400
I mean, I didn't want
to show off, but...

254
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,879
Gosh...

255
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,920
You really are...

256
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,479
So, how did you two meet?

257
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,559
Fucked me up the arse.

258
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,319
I used to manage a bar, and I...

259
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,999
just found her crying,

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,800
in the toilet one night.

261
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,639
How about you two?
How did you two meet?

262
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,360
Through our mother, actually.

263
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,120
How's work, Claire?

264
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,959
Fine.

265
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,519
Nothing new.

266
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,239
She used to be our godmother.

267
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,919
Still am.

268
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,759
But then their parents split up...

269
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,039
Mum died.

270
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,759
And we just became
even closer friends.

271
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,399
Actually, you know - and I can say
this because I'm an artist -

272
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,120
but you really are very
good-looking.

273
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,599
Thank you.

274
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,640
Very.

275
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,999
Thank you.

276
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,279
Very.

277
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,320
Thank you.

278
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,480
I mean, almost...

279
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,440
...too good-looking.

280
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,040
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go and do that old human thing.

281
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,999
How's the exhibition going?

282
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,839
Yes, yes...

283
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,079
I wanted to talk to you about that.

284
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,279
Talking about me?

285
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,560
- Very favourably.
- All good things, I swear.

286
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,399
And again...

287
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,479
- Have you found a venue?
- What exhibition?

288
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,279
Thank you so much for asking.

289
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,919
We have, actually...

290
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,999
There are some elements of the work
that I, you know,

291
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,759
I wanted to talk to you about.

292
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,559
It's a "sexhibition."

293
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,479
But, don't panic, it's nothing scary.

294
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,479
It's simply a journey through
my physical and sexual life,

295
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,159
climaxing in a few pieces

296
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,440
inspired by and moulded on
your father.

297
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,959
And there are photos.

298
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,159
I've taken a photo of my naked body
every year for the past 30 years.

299
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,199
Why?

300
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,719
Well, I think it's important for
women of all ages to see how

301
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,799
my body has changed over the years.

302
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,439
I think they have to have
a healthy perspective

303
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,999
on my body.

304
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,559
- Don't they?
- Absolutely.

305
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,079
I mean, I don't need to tell you,

306
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,560
but your father is
a deeply sexual man.

307
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,119
No, you don't.

308
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,879
Just did.

309
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,839
- Knew it.
- I'm just very lucky.

310
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,519
I will be touched

311
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,479
until the day I die.

312
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,039
And so will you, Claire.

313
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,079
I mean, it's really
all that humans want -

314
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,120
is to be loved...

315
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,200
...and to be touched.

316
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,039
Tell Dad about your promotion,
Claire.

317
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,279
There's nothing to tell.

318
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,959
What promotion?

319
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,159
Finland.

320
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,679
- Odd place.
- Any news?

321
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,719
No.

322
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,879
She got it.

323
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,959
Fuck's sake!

324
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,559
Congratulations, Claire.

325
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,199
- Thank you.
- Clever girl!

326
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,679
Can we not?

327
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,919
This is so exciting...

328
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,960
She's turning it down.

329
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,399
- Why?
- Why?

330
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,119
Why, why not? Why, Claire?

331
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,279
Claire, are you pregnant?

332
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,719
Why aren't you getting on a plane
to your gold rich future?

333
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,839
- This is everything you've worked for...
- Why...?

334
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,799
Because you CAN'T just fuck off
on aeroplanes, and leave your weird

335
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,080
stepson and broken sister
to fend for themselves, OK?

336
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,200
Excuse me.

337
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,639
She's your sister,
it's your job to annoy her...

338
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,759
No, no, I'm just
so annoyed with myself!

339
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,919
I wish I could just...

340
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,119
meet myself and just...

341
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,360
have a go at myself!

342
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,200
Do your worst.

343
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,640
Come on, bitch!

344
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,119
You don't take yourself seriously.

345
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,840
Pussy.

346
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,959
You need to reach out to your family.

347
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,199
You need to stop provoking
your sister - just grow up.

348
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,559
You do not take yourself seriously
as a businesswoman,

349
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,559
you need to pay your fucking bills,
you need to be

350
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,479
nicer to Hillary
and you need to get a new hat!

351
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,079
Is that better?

352
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,320
Yeah, it's better.

353
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,559
OK...

354
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,960
Off you go.

355
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,799
The art work in this house is...

356
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,120
stunning.

357
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,479
Who is it?

358
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,199
If I tell you, will you promise
to come to my sexhibition?

359
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,119
It's not your work...

360
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,599
Will you come?

361
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,840
It would be an honour.

362
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,199
How's your little restaurant?

363
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,599
It's a cafe.

364
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,479
Don't do it a disservice.

365
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,199
I'm not. It's a cafe.

366
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,240
Sorry.

367
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,600
It's fine.

368
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,359
Your father tells me you're struggling.
- Well...

369
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,559
I think we all are.

370
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,999
Well, yes.

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,919
But, I mean,
now there's only one of you...

372
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,919
God, I can't imagine
what you've been through.

373
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,919
I'm sorry, have I missed something?

374
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,719
Well... her dear little friend died,

375
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,959
and left her to run the cafe
on her own.

376
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,199
Jesus.

377
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,399
God, that is truly awful.
How did she die?

378
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,360
- She killed herself.
- It was an accident.

379
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,839
Well...

380
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,039
Maybe it's time to let
the little restaurant go.

381
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,079
Give it up.

382
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,880
Sell it - have a little holiday.

383
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,040
We did this.

384
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,600
And, whatever happens,
we never let it go, OK?

385
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,440
Excuse me.

386
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,039
Have you seen Felicity?

387
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,679
No, sorry.

388
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,319
Gosh, all sorts of things go missing
in this house, don't they?

389
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,279
- Big house.
- Yes, lovely house.

390
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,999
The sculpture turned up.

391
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,159
- Did it?
- Yes.

392
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,799
Must have just toppled off the side.

393
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,199
Well, if you rid a woman
of her head and limbs,

394
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,599
you can't expect her
to do anything other than...

395
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,999
roll around.

396
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,919
What?

397
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,639
Your father and I often say,
when you've had a few drinks,

398
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,240
you're so like your mother.

399
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,200
Look at these.

400
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,479
So, the party's moved to the hallway.
Always a good sign.

401
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,079
Does anyone mind if I leave?
I've got a dicky tummy.

402
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,559
So swift...

403
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,199
Thanks.

404
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,919
I'm not going to kiss you
because I'm probably very ill.

405
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,199
You too. Come on.

406
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,040
Goodbye then, my...

407
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,520
...my daughters.

408
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,560
Goodbye.

409
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,760
What a lovely occasion.

410
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,959
Yeah. See you at the sexhibition.

411
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,839
No, there's absolutely no need to...

412
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,199
- Yes, lovely.
- No, no - I'll definitely be there.

413
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,679
I will definitely be there.

414
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,279
Hold up!

415
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,759
You trying to keep me overnight?

416
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,960
Very good-looking.

417
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,679
I might never see you again,
but you're very good-looking.

418
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,240
Yes, yes... very good-looking.

419
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,759
Thanks, I owe you.

420
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,039
No, I owe you.

421
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,920
It's been really nice to spend
the day with a normal family.

422
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,160
I actually feel quite emotional.

423
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,519
Will you stay with me tonight?

424
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,279
Sure.

425
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,080
I'm going to go warm up the bike.

426
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,400
- Lovely to meet you, Claire.
- You too.

427
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,159
What's his...?

428
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,320
Fucked me up the arse.
Yep. It's...

429
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,880
I totally see that now.

430
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,959
I'm sorry I was...

431
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,200
Listen to me.

432
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,639
I'm going to leave Martin.

433
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,559
I'm going to give you
the money for the cafe,

434
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,760
and I'm going to go
to fucking Finland.

435
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,080
OK.

436
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,880
And...

437
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,839
That is the coolest thing
you've ever done.

438
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,960
I know.

439
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,760
Thanks, Claire.

440
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,160
Shall we...?

441
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,280
We can try.

442
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,920
- I'll see you at the sexhibition.
- Yeah.
