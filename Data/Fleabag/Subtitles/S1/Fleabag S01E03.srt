1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,519
What a pair, where did you get this?

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,919
Can I have it?

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,959
No.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,159
Did you take the sculpture?

5
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,199
No.

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,959
If I sell it I take 10%, deal?

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,919
How behind are you?
If it's money that you need...

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,919
I don't need money.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,759
That'll be £25, please.

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,000
I thought we should try and
surprise each other once every day.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,919
He's organising you
a surprise birthday party.

12
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,479
You know I hate...

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,359
Surprise!

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,519
It's me, it's me.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,239
I suppose you should meet Hillary.

16
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,999
You will never see me again.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,559
I've got to think about all the people
I can have sex with now.

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,800
I should get on it.

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,320
Jogging.

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,679
I did a fart the other day
that was exactly like Mum's.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,839
A door opening, or suspicious dark?

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,639
Door opening.

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,039
Means you're getting Mum's bum.

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,999
God, I'd be lucky.
My bottom dropped ages ago.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,399
My farts used to be like, "Pah!"

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,479
Now they're just sort of
fighting their way out.

27
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,680
I haven't farted
in about three years.

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,320
Happy birthday.

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,640
- She won't eat it.
- Thanks.

30
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,639
So, it's a 7 pm arrival tonight
for a 7.30 surprise, OK?

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,839
Yeah, I got your e-mail.

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,919
It's really a business
birthday thing.

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,199
It won't be much fun,
so just don't expect a "party" party.

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,559
I won't.

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,879
And maybe...

36
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,399
just wear trousers.

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,879
And don't drink too much.

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,319
There's this huge promotion
in Finland,

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,279
so this party is quite a serious...

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,679
I mean, it's basically
a business meeting.

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,599
Sounds like a blast.

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,839
Can I bring a date?

43
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,239
- Harry?
- No.

44
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,239
Who?

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,400
I don't know yet.

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,199
It's really inappropriate
to jog around a graveyard.

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,439
Why?

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,680
Flaunting your life.

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,040
God, I can't wait to be old.

50
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,999
If it's any consolation,
you look older than you are.

51
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,520
Sorry, sorry.

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,279
- Hello, Claire speaking.
- Mum died three years ago.

53
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,679
She had a double mastectomy
but never really recovered.

54
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,679
It was particularly hard,
cos she had amazing boobs.

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,439
She used to tell me I was lucky

56
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,919
cos mine would never get in the way.

57
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,799
My sister's got whoppers,

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,720
but she got all of Mum's good bits.

59
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,719
What's Martin given you?

60
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,839
A cursory stroke would be nice.

61
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,879
What? No bang-bang?

62
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,640
He says he's still got
that thing on his...

63
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,719
What?

64
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,519
On his...

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,919
Come on, you can do it.

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,919
- I don't have to say...
- Yes, you do. - No, not here.

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,719
Come on, little one. Come on, please.
- No.

68
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,400
- Penis.
- Thank you.

69
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,280
He says he still has that thing
on his penis. Sorry.

70
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,719
Christ, look at that man.

71
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,760
Tragic.

72
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,719
Nah, he's a con.

73
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,319
You can't call someone
who is grieving a con.

74
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,879
- That is shit grieving.
- Look at him, he's properly grieving.

75
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,440
No-one grieves like that unless
they are in a film or from Italy.

76
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:51,279
Who are you to pass judgment
on his grief?

77
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,319
Trust me, he's at a different grave
every day, he can't get enough of it.

78
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,199
What?

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,600
You come here every day?

80
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,159
Don't do a jumpy-outy surprise thing,

81
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,999
and don't sing Happy Birthday,
I couldn't bear it.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,080
I'm...

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,080
I'm actually looking forward to it.

84
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,240
Hi, Harry, it's me.

85
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,239
Listen, I know we're broken up,
but it's Claire's birthday tonight

86
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,480
and I thought that...

87
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,399
I thought that maybe

88
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,920
you'd like to come to her...

89
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,160
...birthday party.

90
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,320
Anyway, give me a call,
and I hope you're OK. Bye.

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,880
I can't go out with a dog.

92
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,439
My boyfriend before Harry
used to make me send him pictures of

93
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,079
my vagina wherever I was,

94
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,719
ten or 11 times a day.

95
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,920
One day when I was temping
he asked me to...

96
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,040
Time to throw the net out.

97
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,879
I am in so much trouble.

98
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,239
Jesus Christ.

99
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,519
What am I going to get Claire?

100
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,399
I am meant to get her
the perfect present.

101
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,639
- I am not drunk.
- Always drunk.

102
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,679
I am not drunk!

103
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,879
Which is odd,
cos Claire's so straight.

104
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,039
Smack me in the face.

105
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,559
- Really hard.
- Really?

106
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,639
Yeah.

107
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,760
Good.

108
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,399
Fuck.

109
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,399
I think you gave me a semi.

110
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,519
Can I eat a water or a sandwich,
or something?

111
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,279
I mean, the man's got a problem.

112
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,559
Speak to me. Speak to me.

113
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,559
But no-one wants to admit there's
a problem because then they don't get

114
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,559
to have crazy nights out
with Fun Drunk Martin.

115
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,279
Chicken, are you chicken? No.

116
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,719
He's one of those men who is
explosively sexually inappropriate

117
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,839
with everyone, but makes you
feel bad if you take offence

118
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,719
because he was "just being fun".

119
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,239
Honestly, you could tell him
you're going to pop to the loo

120
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,279
and he'll say...

121
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,279
Yes, you pop to the loo,
pull down your knickers,

122
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,599
and then I will come in

123
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,200
and fuck you.

124
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,799
I mean, this place is ridiculous.

125
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,639
Does anyone ever come here?

126
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,039
I mean, it is creepy as fuck.

127
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,599
Why don't you get her a guinea pig?

128
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,479
It was a surprise hit here.

129
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,999
What, you think she'd like a pig?
Can I take this one?

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,040
No, not that one.

131
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,759
Christ, woman, there's something
wrong with that one,

132
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,759
it's got death in its eyes.

133
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,919
Yeah, the vet says she's depressed.

134
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,520
Aren't we all, girl?

135
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,079
You know, guinea pigs
can die of loneliness.

136
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
Can they?

137
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,399
- Hold her.
- No.

138
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,559
- She needs it.
- No.

139
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,600
Shh!

140
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,919
I have an idea.

141
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,439
He's sexually inappropriate and
he eats raw sausages but no-one's

142
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,599
made her laugh like he does,
so I guess I have to give him that.

143
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,239
Right, just put your... What are
you doing? What are you doing?

144
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,519
No. Stop it.

145
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,079
No, no, no, there.

146
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,680
There we go.

147
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm an innocent man.

148
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,639
I bought her a necklace
with her name on it,

149
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,799
that she found and told me not to buy.
- OK.

150
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,399
I bought her a book

151
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,359
that she already has.

152
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,479
She says not to buy her any clothes

153
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,479
because she probably won't wear them.

154
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,920
She scares me!

155
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,079
This sandwich is so good.

156
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,199
Look, this is London.

157
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,919
Just fuck off and buy something
weird and expensive.

158
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,599
No, no, it's got to be good,
all right. Help me!

159
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,799
Pay me and I'll help you.

160
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,999
Fuck off.

161
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,319
How much?

162
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,439
£60.

163
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,679
- 70.
- Done.

164
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,720
Yeah!

165
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,960
I don't know who she is.

166
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,439
Is she...?

167
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,480
No.

168
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,919
What about...?

169
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,960
No!

170
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,920
Just... get whoever you are.

171
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,080
Who are you?

172
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,599
I don't know.

173
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,000
I want to be that person.

174
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,239
I have been that person.

175
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,159
Ha.

176
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,279
But most of the time I'm
that person, like everyone else.

177
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,679
They're good, right? Chic.

178
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,999
Chic means boring -
don't tell the French.

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,599
What about these?

180
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,960
No. God.

181
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,840
Stop checking, all right,
nobody loves you. Help me here.

182
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,320
Who is this person?

183
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,720
Fuck, no.

184
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,639
This is perfect.

185
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,959
Get her something
she'd never get herself.

186
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,039
Surprise her.

187
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,519
She'll think I've gone nuts.

188
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,199
No, she'll think you see her
as this person,

189
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,639
and everyone wants to be this person.

190
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,999
I don't know, I...

191
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,119
Aren't these for children?

192
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,160
No.

193
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,120
Let's keep going. I saw some more
stuff she'll hate over there.

194
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,799
My neighbour

195
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,279
is really fit.

196
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,439
Which one?

197
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,879
- The fit one.
- The one with the sexy big belly?

198
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,640
No, no, he's the other neighbour.
He's like, he's like, OK...

199
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,799
I'm going to hold his face
in my head so you can see him.

200
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,840
OK.

201
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,679
I'm not getting anything.

202
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,919
Make your face his face.

203
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,960
Yeah, OK.

204
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,639
Is he mixed race?

205
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,039
I'm getting mixed race.

206
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,079
Yes!

207
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,919
- That's him.
- Go on.

208
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,599
No.

209
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,800
OK. OK!

210
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,119
Jesus.

211
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,079
I'm really sorry, we're really high.

212
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,240
We just really wanted to know
what you look like.

213
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,600
She thinks you're lovely.

214
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:52,480
My God, look at my elegant feet.

215
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,079
Hey. Hey! Hey. Hey.

216
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,279
Hello!

217
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,320
Hey. HEY!

218
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,120
What's your problem?
Who was that?

219
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,039
No-one, it was...

220
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,199
What?

221
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,519
No, no-one. I just need to go
and get a drink, or something.

222
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,839
OK.

223
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,199
Excellent.

224
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,759
Can I go and get my shoes?

225
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
Yeah. OK.

226
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Whoa. Easy, tiger.

227
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,480
Coming from you?

228
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,280
So, come on, who was
that heartbreaker?

229
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,240
He used to go out with Boo.

230
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,000
Then he slept with someone else,
and then she...

231
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,880
Yeah, yeah, I know, OK.

232
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,000
Fuck.

233
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,879
I've never really said
how sorry I was.

234
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,520
You should get the trainers.

235
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,879
She'll say I don't know her.

236
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,039
You don't.

237
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,879
You're just as bad.

238
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,399
It's never clear what she wants.

239
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,839
I should just get her some perfume.

240
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,919
Jesus, just fuck her, please,

241
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,479
for the love of a good woman.

242
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,079
Just wrap your willy up in a bow

243
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,120
and just screw her,
she's going insane.

244
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,519
What is it?

245
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,960
Are you having an affair?

246
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,999
Think you're a clever
little puss, don't you?

247
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,079
A little marital poke
isn't going to kill you.

248
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,359
Would it kill her
to take me out to dinner?

249
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,119
You girls, Jesus.

250
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,079
Anyone said that to her,
they'd be hung.

251
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,360
If they were hung, she probably
wouldn't be complaining.

252
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,360
Little advice from a married man.

253
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,239
You should probably
get yourself out there, sweetie.

254
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,440
You're just tipping your prime.

255
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,559
Another drink?

256
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,639
Bingo.

257
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,480
Excuse me, I have a date.

258
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,000
Get the trainers.
Shop closes in an hour.

259
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,319
God. I was not expecting
to see you again.

260
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,319
Shut up.
- I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm chuffed to my boots, but...

261
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,440
And thank you
for the text, saucy.

262
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,359
And sorry I'm late.

263
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,999
No, it's fine,
it was last-minute.

264
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,239
- It's really nice to see...
- No, no, I'm such a tool box.

265
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,039
You know, I'd like to say I was trying
to save a puppy, or something,

266
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,959
but I just got my coat caught
on someone else's coat outside the Tube.

267
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,319
When we went to separate ourselves,
it was fucking intense.

268
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,453
I had to give him my coat.

269
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,159
What are we doing?
- It's my sister's surprise birthday party.

270
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,719
My God, I love surprises, go on.

271
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,039
But I just thought...
I need to get her a present first.

272
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,159
My God, what are you
going to get her?

273
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,879
I know this beautiful soap shop.

274
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,679
I mean, this stuff just gets you
straight in the bath.

275
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,480
I was thinking more like...

276
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,919
Yeah... these places
all the time...

277
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,240
So... Yup.

278
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,519
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

279
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,999
Sorry, I won't be long.

280
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,560
No, no.

281
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,479
- Hi.
- Hi. - Hi.

282
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,119
Hey, what are you craving?

283
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,599
Just a really,
really cheap thrill.

284
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,399
For you?

285
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,639
Hello.

286
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,359
No, it's for her sister.

287
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,079
It's for my very
sexually frustrated sister.

288
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,679
Just a basic bunny would be great.

289
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,519
OK, well, I'll see what I can
dig out and you go browse.

290
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,560
Thanks.

291
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,919
I think you just...

292
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,320
do it at the bottom.

293
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,520
It's all in the twist.

294
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,159
I know.

295
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,719
You should totally get one of those.

296
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,199
- A vagina?
- Yeah.

297
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,319
I've already got one.

298
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,079
Really? You have... No...

299
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,439
You've got one?

300
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,399
I take it with me everywhere.

301
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,159
You lie. You don't have one
on you now?

302
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,919
Yep. Never going to get it.

303
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,239
Where?

304
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,720
- Where's my vagina?
- Yeah.

305
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,119
Ha, you got me.

306
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,319
I don't carry a vagina
around with me,

307
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,400
that would be way too provocative.

308
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,039
Didn't get it.

309
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,439
OK, so this one's really great.

310
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,359
It's half price because
it's quite relentless.

311
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,079
It's called the Burrower.

312
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,479
Basically it doesn't stop
until you've cum.

313
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,520
Excuse me.

314
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,839
Don't worry about him,
he'll be fine in a minute.

315
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,839
My God, I love surprise parties.

316
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,879
I love them,
I love them, I love them.

317
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,119
Will your parents be there?

318
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,880
- My dad might be...
- Intense.

319
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,440
Parents adore me.

320
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,039
I want you to be totally in love
with me by the end of the night.

321
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,319
OK?

322
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,799
Who's that?

323
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,199
It's my sister.

324
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,959
No! We're going to ruin the surprise.
- No, no...

325
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,919
- No, no, no.
- No, really. - Get down.

326
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,199
It will be fine.

327
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,839
Surprise!

328
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,279
My God, thank you so much.

329
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,919
I'm so surprised.

330
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,159
She's very good.

331
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,279
How divine.
What a lovely husband you have.

332
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,400
Where is he then?

333
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,559
Busy.

334
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,039
I'm blown away.

335
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
I had absolutely no idea.

336
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,359
Hildegard, can I just
grab you for a second?

337
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

338
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,160
Dad, hi.

339
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,639
Thank you for asking, yeah,
I'm essentially a documentary maker.

340
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,679
Docs.

341
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,159
Really?
What is your latest project?

342
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,559
Well, sir, I'm interested in life,

343
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,879
and how it affects lots of people
in all sorts of different ways.

344
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,239
Yeah, it's awesome.

345
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,239
- How did you meet?
- I met her on a bus.

346
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,919
So easy to pick up girls these days.

347
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,119
I was, like, "Hi",
and she was, like, "Take my number."

348
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,879
I was, like, "Yeah."

349
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,319
I'm just going to see if there are
any other wines to try.

350
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,959
It's lovely, I'm just going to see
if there are some others.

351
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,720
Excuse me. Can't resist.

352
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,079
Did you find anything nicer?

353
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,600
I was so sorry
to hear about Harry.

354
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,239
Lovely Harry.

355
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,999
Love Harry.

356
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,680
Exciting news about his new job.

357
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,319
Yes, very exciting.

358
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,280
I was so pleased that you'd
found someone else so fast.

359
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,999
I just can't stop conjuring an image
of you sitting around that cafe,

360
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,719
just all alone,
feeling so terribly lonely.

361
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,440
Just can't stop picturing it.

362
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,119
I don't think you have to be
alone to be lonely.

363
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,159
Dad always taught me that.

364
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,159
Did your father tell you that
one of my pieces has gone missing?

365
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,759
He did.

366
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,919
That's awful, I'm so sorry.

367
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,799
So sweet of you.

368
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,279
Very sweet.

369
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,799
May I cut in?

370
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,359
Yes, of course.

371
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,880
Do you know? You are
the most perfect-looking pair.

372
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,599
Such a great gang.

373
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,559
Do you want some normal food?

374
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,719
No, no.

375
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,440
What I really want you to do...

376
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,959
...is this.

377
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,439
Sorry, nothing happened.

378
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,199
I was trying to be sexy.

379
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,519
It was, it was really sexy.

380
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,719
- Was it?
- What broke?

381
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,119
What broke? Show me.

382
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,399
Nothing, I just slipped.

383
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,479
Claire, this is my friend...

384
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,999
Yes, yes, we've already met.

385
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,040
My wife.

386
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,360
My wife.

387
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,840
All of your desires
are wrapped up in here.

388
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,759
OK.

389
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,800
Open it.

390
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,600
Well, gold has always...

391
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,079
That's really rather wonderful.

392
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,079
Thank you. What is it?

393
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,959
Is it a paperweight, or...?

394
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,440
It is a shrine to your body...

395
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,680
...because I love your body.

396
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,759
Thank you.

397
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,719
This is really...

398
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,199
Can I... Can I see this?

399
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,919
This is really quite something.

400
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,759
I think it's probably a bit
inappropriate for your guests

401
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,479
to see your body at this...

402
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,360
I'm just going to...
Shall I put it somewhere safe?

403
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,159
Smooth.

404
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,040
I told you I'd find you a buyer.

405
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,879
Your boy, he is hilarious,
smart, funny...

406
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,920
Fuck off.

407
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,600
You'd fuck anything, wouldn't you?

408
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,880
Just don't tell her
you got the statue from me, OK?

409
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,999
How much do you want for it?

410
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,120
Finger up the ass, nipple tickle...?

411
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,160
Come on, lighten up.

412
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,720
She's going to leave you one day.

413
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,560
You looking forward to that?

414
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,600
You're an asshole.

415
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,640
Hey.

416
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,360
Hey.

417
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,239
I think you took my coat.

418
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,519
I'm sorry, that's my coat.

419
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,720
Sorry.

420
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,999
Why you leaving so early?

421
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,319
I have to give Hillary
some Earl Grey.

422
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,559
She's not feeling well, so...

423
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,679
I got you this.

424
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,600
I wasn't expecting anything.

425
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,840
It's called a Burrower -
it basically won't stop until you cum.

426
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,160
Sounds horrendous.
Thank you.

427
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,399
Good birthday business?

428
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,279
Huge.

429
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,959
You know, I don't want
to jinx anything, but huge.

430
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,239
Could be life-changing.

431
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,320
Great.

432
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,159
OK, happy birthday.

433
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,200
Thanks.

434
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,720
Are you OK?

435
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,319
Yeah.

436
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,440
Tell the truth.

437
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,600
Are we leaving?

438
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,680
- Yes.
- Birthday girl...

439
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,519
Awesome party, thank you so much.
We had such a great night.

440
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,520
What's that?

441
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,040
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight. - Night.

442
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,720
Shall we?

443
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,399
Surprisingly bony.

444
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,039
I'm nearly finished.
I'm nearly finished.

445
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,759
It's like having sex
with a protractor.

446
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,479
I'm finishing. I'm finishing.

447
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm done. I'm done.

448
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,880
- I'm done.
- OK.

449
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,159
Yeah. Are you done?

450
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,439
Yeah. Yeah.

451
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,199
Amazing. That was amazing.

452
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,680
- Yeah, yeah.
- That was amazing. - Yeah.

453
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,240
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.

454
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,759
For fuck's sake.

455
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,800
What?

456
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,639
OK, you don't go through life
with teeth like these

457
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,320
and not know
when someone's pretending.

458
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,799
What the fuck is that?! I'll kick it.
- No, no.

459
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,879
I'll kick it.

460
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,920
What?

461
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,039
Did we catch that, or is that yours?

462
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,599
- That is a rat.
- It's a guinea pig.

463
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,720
That is a rat.
