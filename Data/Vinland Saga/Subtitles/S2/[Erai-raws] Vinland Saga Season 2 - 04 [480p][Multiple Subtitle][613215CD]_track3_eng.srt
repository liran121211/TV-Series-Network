1
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,060
Your eye is next.

2
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,010
Show me you're afraid.

3
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,060
Don't, Fox!

4
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,760
Snake...

5
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,280
Aw, man. He's in rough shape.

6
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,210
B-Boss, welcome back.
Wh-Wh-When did you get here?

7
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,460
Fox.

8
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,090
Yes, sir.

9
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,680
Come closer.

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,820
Y-Yes, sir.

11
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,820
Badger.

12
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,010
Yes, sir!

13
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,740
Explain.

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,830
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,820
Idiots.

16
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,910
You're a bunch of idiots.

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:49,790
Awakening

18
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,200
What's the point of
you guys bullying the slaves?

19
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,380
The young master's gotta do it himself.

20
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,010
Yeah, b-but he...

21
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:57,270
H-He... got cheeky with us, so...

22
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,650
Sorry. These guys are idiots.

23
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,390
I'm Snake.

24
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,560
I'm Thorfinn.

25
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,000
See that, Thorfinn?

26
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,770
Your body says it wants to live.

27
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,820
I'm going to sleep.

28
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,110
You guys had better
graciously see them back home.

29
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,130
I know I don't have to tell you...

30
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:43,590
that the day you cause
any more trouble over this matter,

31
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,360
you won't be able to chew
your own food anymore.

32
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,590
I didn't hear a "Yes, sir."

33
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,050
Yes, sir!

34
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,770
Thorfinn, you...

35
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,310
Do I want to live?

36
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,570
Live...

37
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,590
Live, and do what?

38
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,820
I see.

39
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,410
Besides your ear,
none of your injuries are very deep.

40
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,650
Once they're healed, you'll be good as new.

41
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,950
I'm sorry you two had to go through that.

42
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:37,700
The master doesn't know what to do
about his guests' misbehavior either.

43
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,590
"Misbehavior?"

44
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,690
Their "misbehavior" nearly got us killed.

45
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,330
It's not as though they'd actually kill you.

46
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,650
You're wrong.

47
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,510
If their boss Snake hadn't shown up,
they really would've killed us.

48
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:03,640
Guys like them think our lives are
worth less than those of insects.

49
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,070
Either way, we couldn't help it.

50
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,570
The strong kill the weak.

51
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,290
It's only natural.

52
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,290
What did you just say?

53
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,370
Now, now, Einar.

54
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,690
If they try to mess with you again,
come talk to me instead of going with them.

55
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,040
More importantly,
we can't allow your wounds to fester.

56
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,550
I'll put some medicine on them.

57
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,810
Medicine?

58
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,100
U-Uh, Pater, we don't...

59
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,930
Don't worry about paying me for the medicine.

60
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,260
It's my responsibility to look after you two.

61
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,190
I'm sorry I struck a nerve.

62
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,960
No, it's fine. Thank you.

63
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,670
You'd better thank Arnheid, too.

64
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:11,190
She ran all around the farm
to tell me what happened.

65
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,050
Rest for today.

66
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,200
I'll talk to the master about it.

67
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,440
Also...

68
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,040
It's one of my old shirts,
so it's probably a bit large for you,

69
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,940
but Thorfinn, you can have this.

70
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,190
After all, yours is full of holes
after what they did.

71
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:46,580
Don't you have anything to say to Pater?

72
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,690
Listen, you. You're supposed to say
"thank you" in these situations.

73
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,440
Go on.

74
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,530
Say it.

75
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,560
Why haven't you been saying anything, anyway?

76
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,840
It's not nice,
when everyone's being kind to you.

77
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,330
It's fine. I know Thorfinn doesn't say much.

78
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,660
Thank you.

79
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,970
Hey, where are you going?

80
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,380
He said we don't have to
harvest wheat today.

81
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:55,980
I'm going to the woods.

82
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,360
These injuries are nothing.

83
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,330
Wait up. I'll go with you.

84
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,610
The way he moved when Snake attacked him...

85
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,970
He's no ordinary man.

86
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,890
And...

87
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,020
The strong kill the weak.

88
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,850
It's only natural.

89
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,320
Thorfinn.

90
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,700
Have you ever been to war?

91
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,010
Yes.

92
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,290
Have you killed people?

93
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,370
Yes.

94
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,790
How many?

95
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,420
Five men? Ten?

96
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,810
Why do you want to know?

97
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,690
I thought you didn't like war.

98
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:15,380
Timber.

99
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,150
I don't remember how many.

100
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,490
I've killed a lot of people.

101
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:52,120
I was on the battlefield since
around the time I was five or six.

102
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,610
I joined the Danish army's
invasion of England.

103
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,770
I was a warrior.

104
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,210
Do you hate me now, Einar?

105
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,430
I was a warrior.

106
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,400
Do you hate me now, Einar?

107
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,370
I don't remember how many.

108
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,050
I've killed a lot of people.

109
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,050
Found you.

110
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:42,680
Damn kid. Die!

111
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,960
You brat.

112
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,620
Kill. Kill him. Die!

113
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,810
Damn it!

114
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,960
Einar...

115
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:14,760
Why do you wake me
every time I cry out in my sleep?

116
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:32,450
I've killed people. I've killed a lot of people.

117
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:41,250
From battle to battle, I've attacked
villages and killed a lot of people.

118
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,570
I'm no different from the people

119
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,850
who killed your family.

120
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,490
Do you...

121
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:19,210
Does anything good come from being alive?

122
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,090
Not for me.

123
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:35,270
Not a single good thing has
happened to me in my entire life.

124
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:49,410
Do you want to die?

125
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,390
I don't know what kind of
terrible fate you've suffered.

126
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,920
I don't want to know what kind of hell
you've lived through, either.

127
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:09,120
But we're able to chit-chat,
eat, shit, and sleep in this hell...

128
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:21,590
because someone kept us alive.

129
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,510
How can you say nothing good's
ever happened to you?

130
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,610
You're wrong.

131
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,450
You're wrong!

132
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,090
Asshole.

133
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,970
Don't act so spoiled.

134
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,210
Besides...

135
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,830
It's not like you killed my family.

136
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:27,700
Don't be so arrogant.

137
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:45,570
Thank you, Einar.

138
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,720
Thank you for waking me.

139
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,560
Jeez...

140
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,550
I can't get enough sleep because
you won't stop talking in yours.

141
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,410
I see.

142
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,510
I'm sorry, Einar.

143
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,280
Just go to sleep already.

144
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,940
Path of Blood

145
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,470
"Path of Blood."
