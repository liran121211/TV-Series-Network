1
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:52,000
Path of Blood

2
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,150
Are you deaf too, you old man?

3
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,660
Don't move, guards.

4
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,030
The king is within reach of my sword.

5
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,490
Is he serious?

6
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,680
Oh, dear.

7
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,270
Askeladd.

8
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,720
You bastard! King Sweyn is mine.

9
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,940
Don't move, Thorkell!

10
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,880
Askeladd's not acting normal.

11
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,320
Don't provoke him.

12
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,570
The king mustn't be harmed.

13
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,930
What?

14
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,590
Put away your sword,
then I'll forgive you for this offense.

15
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,840
Forgive me?

16
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,130
Don't push your luck, you savage.

17
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,640
As punishment for mocking my family
and my people, you deserve to die!

18
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,930
This is my last warning.

19
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,140
Put away your sword, Askeladd.

20
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,470
That's my nickname.

21
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,900
I'll tell you the name my mother gave me.
My real name.

22
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,650
Lucius Artorius Castus.

23
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:50,500
I am the rightful king of the land of Britannia.

24
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,620
I feel better now.

25
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:38,710
For a period of time,
the Danes held dominion over England.

26
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,610
But in the year 1014,
the situation changed rapidly

27
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,480
with the death of King Sweyn of Denmark.

28
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,750
Denmark and England
crossed swords once again.

29
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,520
Canute succeeded his father Sweyn

30
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,080
and took command of the
Danish viking army in England.

31
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,030
Upon hearing news of Sweyn's death,

32
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,570
Ethelred II returned from his exile
to Normandy and was reinstated.

33
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,810
Both men proclaimed themselves
King of England,

34
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,030
and the fate of the throne
was uncertain once more.

35
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,770
England was exhausted
by never-ending battles.

36
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,000
Your Highness, stand back.

37
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,150
I'm fine. I didn't drink any.

38
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,400
Y-Your Highness, have mercy!

39
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,700
I swear to our Lord Jesus Christ
that I didn't know.

40
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,700
I had no idea the drink was poisoned.

41
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,990
Your Highness, have mercy!

42
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,790
Please, King Ethelred!

43
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,130
Bastard...

44
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,500
Such underhanded means...

45
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,970
The situation here is even worse
than we were told, Your Highness.

46
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:36,870
It will take a long time for Mercia,

47
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:42,310
once called the Jewel of the Fields,
to recover from this.

48
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,600
Gunnar, don't speak as though
we had nothing to do with this.

49
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,050
We laid waste to this region.

50
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:52,950
What is that?

51
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,570
Huh?

52
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,270
Oh, right.

53
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:02,520
This is the advance force of our army,
which conquered this region.

54
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,440
That's not what I meant.

55
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,780
I'm asking what it is that they're doing.

56
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,240
Why, pillaging the land, of course.

57
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,810
They're looking for girls to
sell from among the beggars.

58
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,130
I thought I forbade that.

59
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,620
Have them beheaded and
display their heads on the road.

60
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,580
What?

61
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:26,220
B-But collecting the spoils
of war is a military custom.

62
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,750
Cracking down on it harshly would be...

63
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,570
Men who can't maintain discipline
are no soldiers of mine.

64
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,600
Behead them and display
their heads on the road.

65
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,730
Y-Yes, Your Highness.

66
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,670
Hey, you!

67
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,890
What? Seriously?

68
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,750
I appreciate you coming all the
way here, Your Highness.

69
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,880
Floki, have the arrangements been made?

70
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,870
Yes, Your Highness, they await your command.

71
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,760
They can move out immediately.

72
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,560
But you need not have met them yourself.

73
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,640
You could have allowed us to handle the matter.

74
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,130
It's fine. I was already here
observing the military situation.

75
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,270
I shall meet with them.

76
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,550
Earl Eadric of Mercia is a coward.

77
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,890
He is hardly a man worth meeting.

78
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,880
A person's character and their
usefulness are two different things.

79
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,150
Either way, I shall meet him
and judge for myself.

80
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,210
And besides, there is
another reason for my visit.

81
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,340
What do you mean?

82
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,290
Hey!

83
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,300
Canute!

84
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,550
You're here, you bastard!

85
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,300
Canute!

86
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,240
I must appease that.

87
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,700
I imagine it was too great a
task for you and your men.

88
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,100
Yes, indeed.

89
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,490
You little brat!

90
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,930
Let me hit him!

91
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:26,420
Get outta my way and let me hit him once!

92
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,500
Calm yourself, Thorkell.

93
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,110
Why, you friggin' fraggin' little...

94
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:40,760
I hate when someone stops my
battles more than I hate frogs!

95
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,930
What?

96
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,010
Frogs?

97
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,970
Mercia has requested a truce.

98
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,650
Our victory here is as good as certain.

99
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,030
You did well, Thorkell.

100
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,030
Shut up!

101
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:02,120
Battles don't stop until you've
taken the opposing leader's head.

102
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,790
I was about to lop off Eadric's head.

103
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,750
Don't make such a fuss.

104
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,340
Earl Eadric of Mercia is
merely the leader of this region.

105
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,500
Look at the bigger picture.

106
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,620
I don't care about that crap.

107
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,550
I just want to enjoy a
fulfilling life of warfare.

108
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:28,440
In the lands to the east, Ethelred's son,
Edmund, is making some disquieting moves.

109
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:33,860
I ask that you help us pacify the east.
Your overwhelming strength in battle is—

110
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,400
I'll decide where I go and
who I fight, Dicehead.

111
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,820
Canute!

112
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,580
You'd better not have forgotten
what I said to you then.

113
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:55,970
"I'm going to watch what you do from now on,
and who you'll become."

114
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,280
You're still a nobody.

115
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,840
You aren't even the King of England.

116
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,510
You're just a kid.

117
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,900
So listen up, kid.

118
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,750
No matter what you do,
you won't be able to avoid war.

119
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,730
You have no choice but to carve
your path with blood and iron.

120
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,120
Just like Askeladd did.

121
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,650
Don't forget that.

122
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,380
From the start, the path you walk
has been covered in blood.

123
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,370
How long are you going to keep doing that?

124
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,870
It's annoying! Get outta here!

125
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,370
Boy, I'm pissed.

126
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,010
I'll back down for today,
but there won't be a second time.

127
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,660
And don't you forget it.

128
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,600
H-How dare he insult you like that
in front of the soldiers.

129
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,520
Your Highness,
you mustn't overlook this offense.

130
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,950
Why not? It makes sense.

131
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,770
He offered a valuable warning.

132
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,850
He's an honest man.

133
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,850
Move it!

134
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,000
Clear the way.

135
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,400
It would surely be a
pleasure to live like him.

136
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,790
Let's go.

137
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,450
4,000 pounds of silver.

138
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,210
This is everything we were
able to gather at this time.

139
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,270
Please accept this offering.

140
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,780
If you'll withdraw your forces from Mercia,

141
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,760
we'll provide you with an
additional 4,000 pounds.

142
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,090
It's not a bad deal, Canute.

143
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,530
You offer me Danegeld, Eadric?

144
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,160
What is your answer, Canute?

145
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,940
This is nothing.

146
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:40,460
Okay, lift 'em.

147
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,420
Hup.

148
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,790
Let me ask you something.

149
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:39,270
You're paying me this silver so
I'll leave Mercia, aren't you, Eadric?

150
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,270
I-I'm offering you 8,000 pounds.

151
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,360
That should be more than enough
for you to withdraw.

152
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,490
It's not.

153
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,900
Think carefully about what you're saying.

154
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:57,500
You're telling Canute, Bretwalda of England,

155
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,490
to take this money
and leave his own territory.

156
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:06,760
And the price you set on such an
insult against a king is this paltry sum?

157
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,370
I am your king.

158
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,540
I came to this land to quell the rebellion
taking place within my domain,

159
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,730
not for wealth.

160
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,400
This is nonsense!

161
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:31,530
Our king is Ethelred of the
honorable House of Wessex, not you.

162
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,940
Silence.

163
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,400
But Father...

164
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,600
Enough. This is neither the time nor place.

165
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,790
You're right. There is another
who calls himself the King of England.

166
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:49,670
So, did you offer me this deal
with Ethelred's permission?

167
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:56,300
I-I'm sure His Highness would understand
if we explained the situation to him.

168
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,310
Ah, how open-minded of him.

169
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:06,490
So Ethelred would forgive one
of his own vassals for deserting

170
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,600
in order to protect his own land.

171
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,240
Now, that's not nice.

172
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,890
He's got a nasty streak.

173
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,250
The world is in chaos
because there are two kings.

174
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,940
One must die.

175
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,960
Ethelred is a coward who
abandoned his people and throne

176
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,170
to flee into exile during the previous war.

177
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,990
Don't you think it's foolish to trust
the future of England to such a man?

178
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,610
You're telling me to betray him?

179
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,490
You've already betrayed him.

180
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,840
I'd like you to assist me, Eadric.

181
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,060
I'd like to make Ethelred go away.

182
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,030
You've served him for
many years as his vassal.

183
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:18,010
I'm sure you would know
of a good method.

184
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:26,770
Do you intend to strip me of
every last shred of loyalty, boy?

185
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,370
In exchange, I'll allow you to keep Mercia.

186
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,060
Ethelred's head is my price.

187
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,780
A good deal, don't you think?

188
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,210
I refuse. A truce is off the table.

189
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,290
I'll keep fighting a foul man
like you until the bitter end.

190
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:55,130
Floki, this man doesn't seem to be a coward.

191
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,630
He's got some backbone.

192
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,900
In that case,
shall we test it, Your Highness?

193
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,560
Come outside, Eadric.

194
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,380
I have something to show you.

195
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,070
Are you ready?

196
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,610
Yes, Your Highness.

197
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,490
Light it.

198
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,510
Signal fires? What are they signaling?

199
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:27,750
What is this?

200
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,130
What are you doing, Canute?

201
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,570
Father.

202
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,960
L-Look...

203
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,330
Th-There are more over there.

204
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:17,910
C-Canute, what are they signaling?

205
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,790
This is what it means
to go to war against me.

206
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,430
Imagine it, Eadric.

207
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:35,860
Mercia has been reduced to ash.

208
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,600
Do you understand now?

209
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:59,360
If I will it, reducing you to ash
would be no trouble at all.

210
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,690
Father!

211
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,250
Buy peace by offering me Ethelred's head.

212
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,570
It's the smart choice.

213
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:56,330
The next year, in April of 1016,
King Ethelred II of England would die.

214
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,320
Your Highness!

215
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,480
It is said he died of an illness.

216
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,940
After Ethelred's death,
his son Edmund assumed the throne.

217
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,370
As his father's successor,

218
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,950
Edmund caused great trouble for
Canute's forces in a hard-fought war, but...

219
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:42,210
Seven months later in that same year,
he unsurprisingly also died of an illness.

220
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,130
Died of an illness, huh?

221
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,100
It took King Sweyn ten years
to conquer the nation,

222
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:03,860
and this time, it ended in less than three.

223
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:10,330
The Witanagemot will recognize
Canute as Bretwalda.

224
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,290
The coronation will be held
first thing next year.

225
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,770
Don't talk to me about Canute.

226
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,730
You're ruining my beer.

227
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,510
Fine, fine.

228
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,570
Sweyn, Ethelred, and Edmund...

229
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,090
Thanks to the unnatural deaths of his rivals,

230
00:23:54,090 --> 00:24:00,370
in the year 1018, Canute officially
became King of England.

231
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,990
We Need a Horse

232
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,340
"We Need a Horse."
