00:00:01,637 --> 00:00:03,428
Being a flight attendant,
you never know

3
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:04,633
where a new day is going to take you.

4
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:06,450
We jet-set to some of the most beautiful places

5
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:07,205

and live extraordinary lives.

8
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:13,693
And the best part
about it is, it's our job.

9
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,667
- Ever since I was
a little girl,

10
00:00:16,702 --> 00:00:18,616
I wanted to be
a flight attendant.

11
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:22,659
They were these independent,
confident, successful women

12
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,687
that were in control
of their lives.

13
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:28,512
And now that's me.

14
00:00:28,547 --> 00:00:30,109
- I grew up
in a strict community,

15
00:00:30,143 --> 00:00:31,766
where my family
had a clear vision

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,894
for me to become a nurse...

17
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:37,490
Until one day I realized
that wasn't what I wanted.

18
00:00:37,524 --> 00:00:40,912
So I made my own decision
to become a flight attendant.

19
00:00:40,946 --> 00:00:43,937
I haven't looked back since.

22
00:00:47,232 --> 00:00:49,291
I've been doing it
for almost nine years now,

23
00:00:49,325 --> 00:00:51,057
and I'm good at what I do.

24
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:52,586
But when you travel
all the time,

25
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:53,952
I've learned that sometimes

26
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:56,849
life on the ground
can pass you by.

27
00:00:56,883 --> 00:01:00,277
- I became a flight attendant
because I love to travel.

28
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,774
I do have a ten-year-old son
that I do need to take care of,

29
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:05,273
and he is my main focus.

30
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:07,107
- Back home in Arizona,

31
00:01:07,142 --> 00:01:09,106
I was destined
for the white-picket-fence life

32
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,438
of settling down,

33
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:12,038
getting married,
and having kids.

34
00:01:12,073 --> 00:01:14,301
But I knew that wasn't for me.

35
00:01:14,336 --> 00:01:17,232
So I headed to California
and became a flight attendant.

36
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:19,898
Now I'm in control
of my own destiny.

37

and we're always
in and out of town,

- Coming up this season
on <i>fly girls...</i>

522
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:48,844
- Being a flight attendant,

523
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:50,279
I get to visit
all over the world.

524
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:51,548
- I get v.I.P. Hookups

525
00:18:51,582 --> 00:18:54,517
and access to some
of the most glamorous events.

526
00:18:54,552 --> 00:18:56,386
- Like, nobody believes
we get to do this stuff,

527
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,386
but we really do.

528
00:18:57,421 --> 00:19:00,122
- Okay, here we go.

529
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:03,058
Louise and I
are headed to New York.

530
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:04,726
- ♪ w-w-w-watch me move ♪

531
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,328
- I want you to be with me.

532
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,396
- You know how I feel.
It's not gonna go anywhere.

533
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,930
- This isn't High School.

534
00:19:09,964 --> 00:19:12,098
- Well, why can't you just be
supportive of what I do?

535
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:15,501
- Because you're
a flight attendant.

536
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:16,902
- He grabbed my hand.

537
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:18,737
He was like,
"what about the Mile-High Club?"

538
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:20,506
And I said, "what about it?"

539
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,342
- I'm thinking of possibly
going into corporate.

540
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:25,178
- What?
No more flying?

541
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:27,447
- I'm interested
in the supervisor position.

542
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:29,449
- You may have to move out.

543
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:31,451
- 13b... like, really
getting on my nerves.

544
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:32,885
- It's the way you walk down
that aisle...

545
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,386
Unbelievable.

546
00:19:34,421 --> 00:19:36,789
- Okay, that's a little
inappropriate, sir.

547
00:19:36,824 --> 00:19:38,124
- You are rude, Tasha.

548
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:39,492
- You ain't gonna just keep
talking to me like that.

549
00:19:39,527 --> 00:19:40,827
I'm not rude.

550
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:42,228
- If I say you're rude,
it means you're rude.

551
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:46,033
- No, this bitch didn't.

552
00:19:46,067 --> 00:19:48,702
- I came here for you.
- I didn't even invite you!

553
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:50,337
Bye.

556
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,680
- Nikole was hooking up
with the DJ?

557
00:19:58,715 --> 00:20:00,648
What are you doing?

558
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,751
- Our lifestyle
does not make it easy for us

559
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,152
to become friends.

560
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:05,921

561
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,757
