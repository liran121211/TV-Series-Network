I don't think
Virgin America's

an event this big.

out on the fire truck

00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:20,738
You show up, and the promo event
is all about Nikole.

10

- It's not on me, Mandy!
- We were best friends.

11
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:25,495
And then all of a sudden,
we weren't friends at all.

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:26,667
[Crying]
And if you don't see that,

13
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:28,512
maybe we
shouldn't live together,

because I can't
handle this anymore.

00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:33,197

00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:35,269
you never know where
a new day can take you.

and live extraordinary lives.

20
00:00:41,927 --> 00:00:45,708
And the best part about it is
it's our job.

21
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:48,115
- Ever since
I was a little girl,

22
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:50,086
I wanted to be
a flight attendant.

23
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,429
They were these independent,
confident, successful women

24
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:54,931
that were in control
of their lives.

25
00:00:54,965 --> 00:00:58,775
And now that's me.

26
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,212
- I grew up
in a strict community

27
00:01:00,247 --> 00:01:03,555
where my family had a clear
vision for me to become a nurse

28
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,627
until one day I realized...

29
00:01:05,662 --> 00:01:08,021
That wasn't what <i>i</i> wanted.

30
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:11,252
So I made my own decision
to become a flight attendant.

31
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:13,757
I haven't looked back since.

- flying is everything for me.

34
00:01:18,131 --> 00:01:19,667
I've been doing it
for almost nine years now,

35
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:21,436
and I'm good at what I do.

36
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:22,472
But when you travel
all the time,

37
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:23,709
I've learned that sometimes

38
00:01:23,743 --> 00:01:26,781
life on the ground
can pass you by.

39
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:28,986
- I became a flight attendant

40
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,957
because I love to travel.

41
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:33,194
I do have a 10-year-old son
that I do need to take care of,

42
00:01:33,228 --> 00:01:35,900
and he is my main focus.

43
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:37,536
- Back home in Arizona,

44
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,539
I was destined
for the white-picket-fence life

45
00:01:39,574 --> 00:01:40,841
of settling down,

46
00:01:40,875 --> 00:01:42,477
getting married,
and having kids.

47
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:44,749
But I knew
that wasn't for me.

48
00:01:44,783 --> 00:01:47,654
So I headed to California
and became a flight attendant.

49
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:50,258
Now I'm in control
of my own destiny.

we've pretty much stayed

with Tasha and Farrah.

It is a major

I've never done

This is a big thing, because

with her husband,

329
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:13,104

339
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:36,991
but, you know, I've done this
for nine years.

340
00:12:37,025 --> 00:12:40,260
