Jane and Artie forbid the team to pursue this line of inquiry further, but nothing inflames the agents more than being told no. Pete leads the search into its meaning and finds it leading to the Regents' deliberate mind-wipe and release of H.G. Wells through the Janus Coin artifact. Retrieving the Janus Coin, Pete, Myka, Claudia and the hologram of H.G. herself debate the pragmatism of destroying the coin to thwart Walter Sykes' ultimate plan. As they reach a decision, they find themselves confronting a former colleague.\u2014statmanjeff"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2064683", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 728, "number_of_episodes": 64}
