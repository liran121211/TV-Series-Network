G. Wells is retrieved from stasis as a hologram to help the Warehouse team track down the ram's horn that brought down the walls of Jericho.", "Twice before, pairs of Warehouse agents have sought to lay hands upon Joshua's Horn, an artifact that instantly dissolves anything before it and legendarily brought down the walls of Jericho. H.G. Wells, accompanied by Mr. Wolcott, thought they'd at least seen the last of it as it blasted off into outer space from London in 1893. Rebecca St. Claire and Jack Secord thought they saw it explode on a Greenbury, Ohio farm in 1962. Now it appears in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. People and cows continue to disappear in its wake, and Pete and Myka now have their shot at finding it, accompanied by a holographic projection of H.G. Wells as a partner.\u2014statmanjeff"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1918571", "rating": 7.9, "votes": 614, "number_of_episodes": 64}
