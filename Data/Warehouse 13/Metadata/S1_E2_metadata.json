During their investigation, they have a run-in with Bonnie Belski, a persistent FBI agent looking for a logical explanation for the happenings. It seems the bank robbers are using a device that creates a sound resonance so severe, it sort of hypnotizes all who hear it and leaves them in a state of euphoria for minutes after.
