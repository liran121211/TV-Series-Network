1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,520
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,320
- So, you're into me?
- You would know.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,680
- I'll call you then.
- I'd like that.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,520
<i>Bruce never stopped looking
for your sister's body.</i>

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,920
The guy had the best tech
on the planet.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,240
Why didn't he find her?

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,520
<i>- I think Alice is Beth.
- I thought they found her body.</i>

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,920
They found bone fragments.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,480
Skull fragments matching Beth's DNA.

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,840
She is your daughter.

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,240
King of the Crows,
can't even protect your own nest.

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,680
How'd you get in my house?

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,080
You're making this personal, Alice.

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,960
It is personal!

15
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,200
What the hell do you want?

16
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,880
You're gonna tell me
everything you know about Alice.

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,600
You're not Batman.

18
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,760
That's the point.

19
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,680
Shiny, shiny.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,200
<i>Keep your Tiffany's close
and your Mikimoto closer, Gotham.</i>

21
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,880
<i>Last night marks
the third bling theft in a week,</i>

22
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,480
<i>this time nearly killing a guard
in the process,</i>

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,400
<i>while today everyone is asking,
where was Batwoman?</i>

24
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,520
<i>Hot off the heels
of her city-wide debut</i>

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,000
<i>and she's a no-show.</i>

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,800
<i>Seriously, was she curling her hair?</i>

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,680
<i>Overcome by the myriad
of red lipstick shades?</i>

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,120
<i>Going through a breakup...</i>

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,600
Thank you.

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,280
Going through a breakup?

31
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,440
Batwoman literally risked
her life protecting the city.

32
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,680
Well, I heard she's doing Batman.

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,080
Oh, you heard?
From who? Killer Croc?

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
I kind of like her, actually.

35
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,160
- Gotham could use a woman as such.
- Oh, so you are into red heads now.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,760
No, not at this exact moment.

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,160
I hate whoever that is.

38
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,320
Sorry, it's my...

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,040
My friend type thing.

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,640
Girlfriend, because that's
just what sounded like.

41
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,640
It's a guy friend from work. We share
a office space, the water main broke.

42
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,240
That sounds really serious.

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,560
I know, yeah, I should probably go.

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,960
You come over super late,
you leave before breakfast.

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,280
I feel like I can date you
and start a new hobby.

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,200
I'll make it up to you.

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,400
- Okay, I have to go.
- What if you don't? Stay back.

48
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,400
<i>A wise woman once said,</i>

49
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,480
<i>"Hurt me with the truth.
Don't comfort me with a lie."</i>

50
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,200
{\an5}<i>Yes, Bruce, I'm quoting Rihanna.</i>

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,400
<i>Because I'm not a liar.</i>

52
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,680
{\an5}<i>I have never hidden who I am.</i>

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,200
{\an5}<i>I came out when Brad Morrison
told all the kids at school</i>

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,360
{\an5}<i>that I was gay.</i>

55
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,080
{\an5}<i>I said, "Yeah, and?"</i>

56
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,240
{\an5}<i>And punched him.</i>

57
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,400
<i>Ever since then</i>

58
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,960
{\an5}<i>I've been out and proud
as long as I can remember.</i>

59
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,520
{\an5}<i>So how the hell am I supposed
to wake up every morning</i>

60
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,800
{\an5}<i>and hide who I am?</i>

61
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,760
{\an5}That is brilliant.

62
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,560
But do watch the glare, Margot.

63
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,720
{\an5}Can I get a bounce card?

64
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,160
{\an5}Hey, wanna tell me
what the hell is going on?

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,480
You must be Roxanna.

66
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,160
{\an5}Such a pleasure, Ms. Kane.

67
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,080
The Museum of Antiquities
is so grateful

68
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,960
you're lending us
Martha Wayne's necklace.

69
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,440
{\an5}We cannot think
of a better showpiece

70
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,360
to represent strong women
and pillars of their community.

71
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,880
{\an5}She always loved your museum.

72
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,320
Margot, is that the last lens change?

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
{\an5}- Yes.
- Shall we get a few more shots?

74
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,360
{\an5}Then we can get out
of Ms. Kane's hair.

75
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,040
- Where have you been?
- Now, here.

76
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,560
{\an5}I'm seeing someone.

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,440
{\an5}Okay, so, while you've been...

78
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,280
{\an5}That Magpie struck again.

79
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,960
She nuked a place last night.

80
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,920
Nearly killed a security guard.

81
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,440
{\an5}The vinework is so earth chic.

82
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,440
{\an5}It's a work in progress.

83
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,640
{\an5}Well, with that giant
"Wayne" sign on the building,

84
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,360
{\an5}I'm sure whatever it is
will make Gotham proud.

85
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,760
{\an5}- No pressure, right?
- I'll have our security team

86
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,920
{\an5}bring the necklace
to the event tomorrow.

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,080
Smart.

88
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,960
With everything that's been
happening around the city,

89
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,120
{\an5}you can never be too careful.

90
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,080
{\an5}So, that is not why I called.

91
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,280
So your pet, Dodgson,
not looking too good

92
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,680
and probably not smelling great.

93
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,920
What are we doing here?

94
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,880
{\an5}He hangs out until he tells us
Alice's grand plan.

95
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,080
- Or he dies.
- He's just dehydrated.

96
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,520
- He's septic.
- Were you this annoying

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,920
when Batman took people prisoner?

98
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,600
{\an5}I didn't think so.

99
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,240
{\an5}Yeah, he needs an ER.

100
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,320
Does your husband know
what's in plot 283, Catherine?

101
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,760
Your driver's gone nighty-night.
He's on a Benzo break.

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,280
What are you doing here?

103
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,520
The great existential question.
What are we all doing here?

104
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,680
You know, the thing I love
about bad guys

105
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,800
is that despite ourselves,

106
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,720
we are all so tragically predictable.

107
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,200
Of course you'd follow
the cards I left right back here

108
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,920
to cover your tracks.

109
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,320
What do you want?

110
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,360
To keep this to myself.

111
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,000
And in return,
you are gonna give something.

112
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,320
A very powerful toy.

113
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,200
I understand that Hamilton Dynamics

114
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,840
is developing a very
"top secret weapon".

115
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,360
I own one of the largest
defense companies in the country.

116
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,520
I'm hardly privy
to its day-to-day project

117
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,560
- management side.
- But you are.

118
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,560
You are the priviest.

119
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,000
Because this particular project
was your idea.

120
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,720
How do you know that?

121
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,120
Well, I spent an hour
in your house, Catherine.

122
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,520
What did you think,
I was just only poking around

123
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,640
your shoe closet?

124
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,120
Which should be its own monument,
by the way.

125
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,160
Yeah, you are gonna give it to me
by 10.00pm tomorrow,

126
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,760
or Commander Kane will know that
you are the one who convinced him

127
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,840
his dear darling daughter was dead.

128
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, my God.

129
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, my God.

130
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,600
Hi! You're Batwoman.
Mary Hamilton. Huge fan.

131
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,800
But not in, like, an annoying way.

132
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,440
Can I just say welcome to Gotham?

133
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,800
And you know what, screw the haters.

134
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,680
I once wore a jumpsuit and it was
bordering on last season...

135
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,040
I need your help.

136
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,640
I heard you're discreet.

137
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,680
Okay. Yeah. Anything.

138
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,680
Okay, so, he actually
just tried to kill me, so...

139
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,480
That's not me saying no.

140
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,760
It's just slightly more complicated.

141
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,000
Why do you have him?

142
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,520
I need to know
what Alice is planning.

143
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,040
This is grossly infected.

144
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,920
You don't have any Neosporin
in your bat belt?

145
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,360
- Can you save him?
- I can try.

146
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,120
Because I actually subscribe
to a code.

147
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,680
It's called "do no harm."

148
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,280
- I'll be back for him.
- We'll be here.

149
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,400
Hopefully, alive.

150
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,720
<i>If I wanted to be
a beacon of hope to Gotham,</i>

151
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,680
<i>I needed to show them
that I was there.</i>

152
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,240
<i>I had to restore their confidence
in the Bat.</i>

153
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,600
<i>And to do that,</i>

154
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,200
<i>I needed to catch
Gotham's most dangerous thief.</i>

155
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,640
<i>Batcave to Batwoman.</i>

156
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
How long have you waited
to say that?

157
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,400
Honestly, it just came to me
two seconds ago, so...

158
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,560
What do you want?

159
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,520
I've been thinking, why is this
Magpie woman so hard to track?

160
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,720
The police can't find her,

161
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,080
she's one step ahead of The Crows,

162
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,200
<i>no trace of her
on any city surveillance,</i>

163
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,800
and then it occurred to me,

164
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,560
everyone's looking for a woman,

165
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,240
when we should be looking for a bird.

166
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,400
Eagle cams.

167
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,800
Do we have to be
on opposite sides?

168
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,280
Birds of a feather
should flock together.

169
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,760
I'm allergic to feathers.

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,240
An egg? Really committing to this
whole bird thing, aren't you?

171
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,120
- You really think it's worth it?
- Maybe not to you.

172
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
But to me it's food,
a roof over my head,

173
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,960
and a modicum of dignity.

174
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,920
<i>Batarang? More like Bat-a-wiff!</i>

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,400
<i>According to the gallery's
security footage,</i>

176
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,640
<i>last night, our lady crusader
missed the return</i>

177
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,560
<i>on her not-so-trusty batarang</i>

178
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,560
<i>and caused some major damage
to a gilded vase</i>

179
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,720
<i>that once belonged
to Marie Antoinette.</i>

180
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,840
<i>And we thought
Magpie was a threat to this city.</i>

181
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,120
<i>Talk to me, Gotham.</i>

182
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,040
<i>Do we need to take out
an insurance policy</i>

183
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,880
<i>on our new hero?</i>

184
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,360
You probably miscalculated
the precession torque.

185
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,840
- I didn't.
- Maybe you angled it wrong.

186
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,200
- Maybe it's broken.
- It's not broken.

187
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,440
If it worked, I would've caught it.

188
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,920
Did you try flicking your wrist
backward then snapping it for...

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You're batsplaining. I already
have the whole city on my butt.

190
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,000
I do not need you
joining in the chorus.

191
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,000
Well, good news, bad news.

192
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,320
I figured out what you ripped off
Magpie's belt last night.

193
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,560
Grenades.

194
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,160
Yeah, cute but no less deadly.

195
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,520
Concussion or fragmentation?

196
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,240
Probably an M67
filled with TNT or gunpowder.

197
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,920
I'll know more
after I run a chemical analysis.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,360
It could help us track down Magpie.

199
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,040
- How long would that take?
- Depending on the complexity

200
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,200
of the deformulation,
hour and a half?

201
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,560
- Great. I'll see you then.
- Wait, where are you going?

202
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,960
I owe someone a lunch.

203
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,680
Someone? A date?
Cool. Yeah, no, I'll be here.

204
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,320
Not dating anyone
because I love to work.

205
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,440
Love to work.

206
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,840
This is great. Have fun.

207
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Pretty song.

208
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,440
Alice was playing it

209
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,040
when she broke into the penthouse
the other night.

210
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,680
Alice plays the cello?

211
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,880
That's so...

212
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,200
On brand.

213
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,840
Beth played the cello.

214
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,760
This was her favorite piece.

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,240
Do you think...

216
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,400
What did you bring me?

217
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,080
The report detailing

218
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,200
the bomb that blew up
Alice's transport van.

219
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
I thought you'd want to see it
before anyone else.

220
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,800
It's an IED
using high-standard components.

221
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
The convoy had seven vehicles.

222
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,080
It hit Alice's van
with a 99.9 percent accuracy.

223
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,680
Bomb probably used
an advanced sensor initiation

224
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,880
to detect its target.

225
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,120
A sensor with that level of detection

226
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,760
is unreleased technology
unique to Hamilton Dynamics.

227
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,840
What are you saying?
The bomb's one of ours?

228
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,080
Why would someone at Hamilton
want to ambush the convoy?

229
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,920
You were living with polar bears,
under the Borealis,

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
no rent, no traffic,

231
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,360
no getting mugged in line
grabbing a coffee.

232
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
Why the hell did you move back here?

233
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,240
- Long story.
- So an ex-girlfriend.

234
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,640
Told you I can read people.

235
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,760
Her name is Sophie
and she's in the past,

236
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,600
and according to her
we never even had a past,

237
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,840
so there's that.

238
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,720
You came home for your ex
who doesn't see you as an ex.

239
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,920
Sounds like
I have nothing to worry about.

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,120
Why are we talking about her?

241
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,160
I used to live there.

242
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,440
Before it was that,
it was a small, charming,

243
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,680
ten-unit place full of sweet,
neighborly, hardworking people

244
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,560
who all got exiled

245
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
to parts of the city
that no one cared about.

246
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,400
Meanwhile, all the predatory
real estate moguls,

247
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
who don't give a crap about
the lives they're uprooting,

248
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,080
get rich.

249
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,400
You were literally evicted
from your childhood.

250
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,760
That's awful.

251
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,040
Not that I'd want to live
in a Crows District anyway.

252
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,360
- No offense.
- You Googled me.

253
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,720
Of course I did.

254
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,200
No one's allowed to have secrets
anymore.

255
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,080
So does that mean
that you will tell me

256
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,920
- where we're going for lunch?
- It does.

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,200
My mom taught English
to the woman who owns the place.

258
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,320
She's super cute
and has the best tofu paneer.

259
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,760
I think you're gonna like it.

260
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,400
Another plumbing emergency?

261
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,040
Electrical fire
in the ventilation system.

262
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,200
That sounds like a real mess.

263
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,080
What is it that you do again?

264
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,840
Nothing, really. Just keeping
tabs on my cousin's building.

265
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,320
Not so good at it, huh?

266
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,880
There's a fundraiser later
at the Antiquities Museum.

267
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,480
- You wanna be my date?
- Maybe.

268
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,600
Come on. 9.30. No emergencies.

269
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,680
Please, please, please.

270
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,640
Okay. Holding you to it.

271
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,840
9.30?

272
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,560
You gotta be kidding me.

273
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,720
Oh, come on.

274
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
She stole the necklace.

275
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,200
She took it by feathers and force.

276
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,520
I'll let the museum know
they're losing their showpiece.

277
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,040
Bruce's mom was killed
for that necklace.

278
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,200
Yeah.

279
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:15,880
He spent years
looking for it on the streets.

280
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,560
Finally found it at an auction

281
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,440
and spent a million dollars
buying it back.

282
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,040
I should have been here.

283
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,760
I have to get it back.
Any leads on the bomb?

284
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,280
Actually, yeah.
Magpie 3D printed them.

285
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,960
- That's new.
- Yeah, I know.

286
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,760
Nano thermites via ink jet.

287
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,360
- Explosive ink.
- It's regulated.

288
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,520
Only a few companies sell it.

289
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,880
Then we find everyone
that it's sold to.

290
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,320
Well, you know, The Crows
do track munition shipments

291
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,880
in and out of the city.

292
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,120
You could ask your girl Sophie

293
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,320
if she can get a list
of who's buying exploding ink.

294
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,240
It's bad timing.

295
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,080
Bad timing.

296
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,720
A bomber loose in Gotham.

297
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
I...

298
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,040
Exploding ink? That's specific.

299
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
Magpie used one
to break into Wayne Tower.

300
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,840
She take anything?

301
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
My Aunt Martha's pearl necklace.

302
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,640
Damn. Does your dad know?

303
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,080
Copy.

304
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,840
Heard the Bat had a run-in
with her the other night.

305
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,960
The Bat?

306
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,760
I thought they were calling her
Batwoman now.

307
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,040
Is that official?

308
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,880
I think so. It's catchy, mature...

309
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,480
So, if she's on the case,
why are you?

310
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,840
You know why.

311
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,320
I don't trust vigilantes.

312
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,480
How's the search going?

313
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,560
Just texted it to you.

314
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,040
Everyone within a hundred mile radius

315
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
who recently purchased
explosive ink.

316
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,880
I really appreciate it.

317
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,280
I'm glad you came to me.

318
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,600
I know things between us
have been a little tense,

319
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,640
but we always make a good team.

320
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,080
I have to go.

321
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,240
So clever of Catherine
to send you boys

322
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,480
to find my cozy burrow.

323
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,680
But you're not the only ones
with ears all around this city.

324
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,280
When you start asking
about our location,

325
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,880
it gets back to me.

326
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,080
Desperate, desperate
Catherine Hamilton-Kane

327
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,480
sending her goons
to clean up her mess.

328
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,280
Perhaps she needs a little reminder

329
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,920
that I'm not playing games.

330
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,920
Who wants to help me
send her a message?

331
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,080
Eeny, meeny,

332
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,280
miney,

333
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,880
moe.

334
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,960
You.

335
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,000
It was him. You pointed at him.

336
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,960
Like I said, I'm not playing a game.

337
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,680
There are no rules.

338
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Another construction firm,

339
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,600
fireworks manufacturer,
gold mining company.

340
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,080
Wait, this shipment
doesn't have a destination.

341
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,760
- Can you key the address?
- Yeah, let me check.

342
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,960
Sophie thinks I'm the Bat.

343
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,680
- How?
- Because I suck at hiding it.

344
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,200
How did Bruce make living
a double life look so easy?

345
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,280
- Oh, he didn't. He was miserable.
- Bruce Wayne?

346
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,480
Guy had three Ferraris
and slept with half of Gotham.

347
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,080
The playboy thing gave him a cover.

348
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,760
Different women meant he could
tell the same lies easily,

349
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,200
but it sucked for him, too.

350
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,960
Honestly, in those last few months,

351
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,560
I think being Batman
was easier for him

352
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,200
than being Bruce.

353
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,280
So the address is a P.O. box.

354
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,720
You can send explosives
to a P.O. box?

355
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,960
If you don't wanna get caught.

356
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,800
I just got to the old Gotham Hotel.

357
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,760
The address linked
to the P.O. box account.

358
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,480
<i>Guy at the facility
gave it to me.</i>

359
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,360
Do I want to know how you
got him to tell you that?

360
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
Let him take a selfie.

361
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,560
Definitely not the answer
I was expecting.

362
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,200
Let me guess,
Batman never posed for selfies.

363
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,160
<i>Wasn't gonna say it.</i>

364
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,080
I think I found Magpie's nest.

365
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,720
I see jewelry, a computer,
a 3D printer...

366
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,080
And my breath, room's freezing.

367
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,200
<i>Well, that's smart.
It's climate rigged.</i>

368
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,320
If anyone enters, their body will
raise the room's temperature

369
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,960
and set off an explosion.

370
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,680
You might wanna lead with that.

371
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,200
I'm sorry, but, yo, check this out.

372
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,680
The suit can lower your body
temperature to match the room

373
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,000
and bypass the sensors.

374
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,480
That is uncomfortably cold.

375
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,520
Rather cold than dead.
Oh, one more thing.

376
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
- What?
- You know you can't breathe,

377
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,320
- right?
- You're kidding me.

378
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,640
I didn't invent kinetic energy.

379
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,760
<i>How long can you
hold your breath for?</i>

380
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,760
Gets dicey after two minutes.

381
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,120
All right, that's how long you got.

382
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,920
Actually, now might be
a good time to let you know

383
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,600
that I fixed the batarang.

384
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,640
And by fixed, I mean realized
it was calibrated for Bruce,

385
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,280
who has longer arms than you.

386
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,160
<i>I guess
it wasn't entirely your fault.</i>

387
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,040
You're probably thinking some
pretty choice words right now,

388
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,800
<i>but since you'll blow up
if you say them out loud,</i>

389
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,640
probably best to keep them
to yourself.

390
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,360
Anyway, all fixed,

391
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,400
recalibrated, for you,

392
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,560
<i>a woman with slightly shorter arms.</i>

393
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,280
<i>Oh, while you're in there,</i>

394
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,880
<i>if you can try to clone a copy
of her hard drive, it'd be great.</i>

395
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,800
<i>It might give us a clue into what
Magpie gets her talon into next.</i>

396
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,400
Definitely been a minute.

397
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,680
<i>Still alive? Don't answer that.</i>

398
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,920
Did you just...

399
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,760
Why?

400
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,600
Stop, Alice.

401
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,600
No.

402
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,600
Don't want to.

403
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,800
Alice! Help me.

404
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,440
Alice...

405
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,160
Oh, I'm not actually Al...

406
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,960
Curiouser and curiouser.

407
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,880
Alice?

408
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,000
Yes, darling.

409
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,840
It's me.

410
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,920
It's Alice.

411
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,080
Where am I?

412
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,120
You're in the rabbit hole, darling.

413
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,760
With the Caterpillar
and the Mad Hatter

414
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,000
and the Queen of Hearts.

415
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,160
I'm actually quite happy you're here.

416
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,880
You see, I've foolishly forgotten
the details of my evil plan.

417
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,120
Perhaps you could...

418
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,960
Stir up a memory or two.

419
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,520
Where is she?

420
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,240
She thinks...

421
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,680
it's me you care about.

422
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,600
Who, dear? The Batwoman?

423
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,920
Darling?

424
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
Finish your thought.

425
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,160
The Batwoman thinks
I care about whom?

426
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,520
She...

427
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,120
Has no idea...

428
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,480
About...

429
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,040
About who?

430
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,120
Who? Who?

431
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,600
Mouse...

432
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,440
She has...

433
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,160
Big plans for him.

434
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
- In position.
- <i>Let me know when you see her.</i>

435
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,000
<i>Way too much tempting bling
for her not to show.</i>

436
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,880
What is that noise?

437
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
Magpie had some
complicated schematics

438
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,320
for something on her hard drive.

439
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,080
They're encrypted,
but I'll try printing them.

440
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,680
<i>Whatever it is
could be her next target</i>

441
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,800
<i>and help us track her down.</i>

442
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,720
- I gotta go.
- Go where?

443
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,000
Reagan's here.

444
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,600
Wait. You invited her to a takedown?

445
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,800
<i>I invited her on a date.</i>

446
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,200
That just happens to be
at the takedown location.

447
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,560
I don't need to tell you that...

448
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,960
Batman would've never done that,
I know.

449
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,880
- Is it done?
- Does this look done to you?

450
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,480
Oh, my God.

451
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,680
That bitch is a rare breed
of psychopath, okay?

452
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,560
Take your money, take your power,
I don't care.

453
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,520
This is your mess, Catherine.

454
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,680
You want her gone, do it yourself.

455
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,080
This is Catherine.

456
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,880
<i>"Oh, dear, oh, dear.
I shall be too late,"</i>

457
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,080
<i>said the rabbit,
tapping at his watch.</i>

458
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,880
Kate.

459
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,640
Sophie.

460
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,240
I didn't know
you were working the event.

461
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,760
I wasn't.

462
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,360
But I figured with
a jewelry thief on the prowl,

463
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,400
we could use the extra manpower.

464
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,040
- Of course you did.
- Kate.

465
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,040
Reagan. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late.

466
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,240
- Hey. Reagan.
- Sophie.

467
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,480
Figured.

468
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,920
Sorry, I didn't realize
you were here with anyone.

469
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,920
I got us drinks.

470
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,480
You two have fun.

471
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,160
So I don't know about you,
but I'm gonna drink this

472
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,960
and pretend
it's not totally uncomfortable

473
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,480
that your ex is here.

474
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Sorry...

475
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,560
I'm being a really crappy date.

476
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,520
Can we start over

477
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,040
and I mention how beautiful you look?

478
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,640
Thank you.

479
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,720
And I hate that that worked.

480
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,440
Ms. Kane. Welcome.
I'm so glad you made it.

481
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,080
- I'm sorry the pearls didn't.
- What do you mean?

482
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,640
Didn't Luke Fox
get in touch with you?

483
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,680
Yes, but I was just so relieved
when the security guards

484
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,880
showed up with them
in the nick of time.

485
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,680
Perfect timing. Excuse me.

486
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,920
Ladies and gentlemen,

487
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,800
tonight, we are here
to celebrate powerful women

488
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,320
throughout history.

489
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,800
And who better embodies that
than Martha Wayne?

490
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,240
It is with utmost gratitude
to the Wayne Estate

491
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,760
that I present to you
tonight's showpiece,

492
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,080
her beloved pearl necklace.

493
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,760
Would you excuse me for a minute?

494
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,960
I was just about to call you.

495
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,880
Martha's necklace is at
the exhibit, which is impossible,

496
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,040
because we never gave it
to the museum.

497
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,320
<i>That is not her necklace.</i>

498
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,320
It's replica. It's the last thing
that Magpie printed.

499
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,520
She snuck a bomb in here.

500
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,560
Why would Magpie bomb the museum?

501
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,120
She's not. It's a Trojan Horse.

502
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,880
Use the explosion in the showroom
as a distraction

503
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,560
and she'll have free reign
over the exhibit room.

504
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,960
The Wayne family has been
a hallmark to Gotham,

505
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,520
and their legacy lives on even today.

506
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,800
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

507
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,920
it looks like we have
a little situation on our hands.

508
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,360
Everyone,
please move towards the exit!

509
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,760
Everyone, calmly towards the exit.

510
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,840
I'm not meant to be a jailbird.

511
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,120
Looks like you have a choice to make.

512
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,960
The shiny jewels are all insured,

513
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,280
but those sitting ducks
only have one life.

514
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,840
Which are you gonna save?

515
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,360
Mommy, I found a marble.

516
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,840
It's really you.

517
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,400
It's over.

518
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,440
I've seen you before,
you're the photographer.

519
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,080
You weren't just taking photos
at Wayne Tower,

520
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,640
you were casing it.

521
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,760
People like you
never notice people like me.

522
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,240
You put a lot of lives
in danger tonight.

523
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,440
Well, some of us don't have

524
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,480
the privilege of sitting in our tower

525
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,120
having angst about what to do
with our lives, Ms. Kane.

526
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,080
We just do it. To survive.

527
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,880
Time to go to Blackgate, Margot.

528
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,680
- Hey, did you see that?
- I didn't. I was on a call.

529
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,280
Batwoman showed up. It was surreal.

530
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,880
I tried calling you.

531
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,560
I must've been in a dead zone.

532
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,200
You just said you were on a call.

533
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
I did. I...

534
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,720
So here's why this sucks.

535
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,720
I like you.

536
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,080
You're funny. You're cool.

537
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,760
But that's not really enough.

538
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,880
I'm not a needy person, Kate,
but if I'm gonna make an effort,

539
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,320
miss a spin class,
or rearrange a work shift...

540
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,240
All I ask for is a little honesty.

541
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,040
Here's why this sucks.

542
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,080
I think you're fun and cool

543
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,600
and seem to care about
all the right things.

544
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,840
And I'm not in a place right now

545
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,000
where I can share all of myself
with someone else.

546
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,040
I am sorry.

547
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,440
I get it.

548
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,800
You obviously have a lot going on.

549
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,600
I just hope whatever it is,
it makes you happy.

550
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,880
Well,

551
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,400
this is a nice surprise.

552
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,600
Sweetheart, you okay?

553
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,840
Alice came to me today.

554
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,560
She came to you. Are you all right?

555
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:43,000
Yeah, I'm fine. She didn't hurt me.

556
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,480
She wants something.

557
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,120
Hamilton is developing a new project,

558
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,840
and Alice has taken interest.

559
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,120
- What?
- It doesn't matter.

560
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,360
I refuse to put any weapon
into the hands of a terrorist.

561
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,040
Don't answer that. It could be her.

562
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,080
Well, if it's her, I should get it...

563
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,360
Jacob, please...

564
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,240
You should hear this from me.

565
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,520
Sweetheart, what's going on?

566
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,160
It was years ago.

567
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,240
I thought
it was the right thing to do.

568
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,600
You thought what was
the right thing to do?

569
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,600
You and Kate wouldn't stop looking.

570
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,920
Kate was up all night.

571
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,520
She wasn't going to school.
She was refusing to eat.

572
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,080
She wouldn't give up,
and she wasn't living her life.

573
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,680
The more despair that she felt,

574
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,880
the more broken you became.

575
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,440
What did you do, Catherine?

576
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,320
You were both
in a downward spiral, Jacob.

577
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,320
You never would've moved on
if you didn't...

578
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,680
Think that Beth were dead.

579
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,720
They found bones.

580
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,200
Skull fragments.

581
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,920
Hamilton employees found bones...

582
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,440
From a deer.

583
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,560
I paid the DNA analyst
to write the report.

584
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,480
The police, the...

585
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,800
My investigators, the entire city,

586
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,680
had been looking and looking for Beth

587
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,360
without finding so much
as a sock, Jacob.

588
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,720
- She was gone.
- Stop.

589
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,040
Get away from me.

590
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,560
Just...

591
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,560
Just get away from me.

592
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,120
You have to stop doing that.

593
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,480
Sudden adrenaline release
can lead to cardiac arrest

594
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,720
and I'm way too busy to have
a heart condition right now.

595
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,440
- You fixed him.
- He's stable.

596
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,400
An hour later
and I may not have been able to.

597
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,640
You were right.

598
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,240
I shouldn't have let him
get this bad.

599
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,800
Yeah, so, on that topic,

600
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,560
I may have prodded him a little

601
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,160
while he was under
a morphine haze.

602
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,520
I know, but he ruined
my favorite plaid shirt

603
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,480
when he stabbed me.

604
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,880
So my point is

605
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,320
Alice is looking for a Mouse
or someone named Mouse.

606
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,000
He said "Mouse,"
and she has big plans for him.

607
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,920
So I thought you should know.

608
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,440
Hang on! You can't just...

609
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,280
What is that?

610
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,000
Subdermal transponder.

611
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,880
- A what?
- Chipped him.

612
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,040
He'll lead me to Alice,
I'll figure out who Mouse is.

613
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,680
Oh, okay.

614
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,000
- Good work, Mary.
- Okay.

615
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,400
Thank you.

616
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:34,120
<i>The bomb-loving bird is finally
in a cage where she belongs.</i>

617
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,080
<i>Batwoman clipped her wings.</i>

618
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,320
<i>And she wasn't very sweet
about it either.</i>

619
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,920
<i>Hey, Batwoman,
you have a such a pretty face.</i>

620
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,040
<i>Ever think about smiling more?</i>

621
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,520
Another win in the bat column.

622
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,000
Almost got a compliment
out of Vesper Fairchild, too.

623
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,680
I reunited a bunch of billionaires

624
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,080
with things
they probably didn't miss.

625
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,080
You also saved
a lot of innocent lives.

626
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,720
The city trusts you now.

627
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,200
They trust Batwoman.
Kate Kane is a different story.

628
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,120
What do you know
about real estate?

629
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,880
Everyone hates popcorn ceilings?

630
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,080
So more than me.

631
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,040
I'm starting a real estate firm.

632
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,640
Okay, so,
the last thing the city needs

633
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,160
is another predatory developer
cluttering the skyline.

634
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,840
I agree.

635
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,480
That's why I want to buy
run-down buildings

636
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,920
from outside the Crows districts,

637
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
keep the rents low,

638
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,640
and give them back
to the community.

639
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,120
So Bruce was a billionaire playboy,

640
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,880
and you're gonna be who,
Joanna Gaines?

641
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,800
- You can be Chip.
- I just told you.

642
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,280
I don't know anything
about real estate.

643
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,360
Well, you better learn quick

644
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,640
because you're gonna be
my assistant.

645
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,040
- Associate.
- Up for debate.

646
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,320
<i>Dear, Bruce, Queen Rihanna was right.</i>

647
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,240
<i>Lies don't make anyone comfortable,</i>

648
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,760
<i>especially the one telling them.</i>

649
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,800
<i>But no one said anything
about this job being comfortable.</i>

650
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,480
<i>If I'm going to embrace the Bat,</i>

651
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,760
<i>then I'm going to have to embrace
hiding a part of myself</i>

652
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,000
<i>from the outside world.</i>

653
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,280
<i>Living this double life
is a sacrifice.</i>

654
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,000
<i>But our city is worth it.</i>
