1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,640
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,960
I lost my sister, Beth.
Remember her?

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,440
Beth has gone down, down,
down the rabbit hole,

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,840
and she's never coming back.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,000
Alice is looking for a "Mouse"?
She has big plans for him.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,520
- What in?
- Chipped him.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,680
He leads me to Alice,
I figure it out who Mouse is.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,880
I never understood
why you stopped looking for me.

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,720
I always thought a father would
do anything to find his daughter.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,920
I won't let you forget me,
Commander, not again.

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,600
<i>You'd think having spent
nine months</i>

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,080
<i>in our mother's womb together</i>

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,280
<i>and every other day for 13 years,</i>

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,680
<i>we wouldn't be such
great mysteries to one another.</i>

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,200
<i>But we are.</i>

16
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,640
<i>I don't know
what the rest of her story is...</i>

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,760
<i>But that's the puzzle
I'm determined to solve.</i>

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,400
<i>Before it's too late.</i>

19
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,520
They're calling him
the "Skin Pirate"

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,360
{\an5}because apparently
he likes to take skin

21
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,960
{\an5}- from the booty.
- Never say that again.

22
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,520
{\an5}I didn't write the article. Point
being, whatever they're calling him,

23
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,000
he has quite the work ethic.

24
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,440
{\an5}He hit three morgues in one night.

25
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,640
{\an5}All three break-ins
were nine minutes apart.

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,960
{\an5}That's a pretty tight window.

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,560
{\an5}Yeah. Calculating the quickest
route between them.

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,400
Can you get eyes on that?

29
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,800
Looks like our he is a she.

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,280
{\an5}Does she look familiar to you?

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,360
- Is that Alice?
- No.

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,800
- You sure about that?
- Hang on.

33
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,440
{\an5}She's not the Skin Pirate, okay?
It's too sick. Even for her

34
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,840
{\an5}Let's not forget we have access
to something that GCPD doesn't.

35
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,640
{\an5}Wayne's closed circuit cameras.

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,960
There aren't many, but let's see
if they caught anything.

37
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
{\an5}Yeah. Yeah, that's her.

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,840
{\an5}I'll look into whatever the hell
she could be using the skin for

39
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,440
if you remind me to clear
my image search history.

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,000
{\an5}- What are you doing?
- Stopping her.

41
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,040
{\an5}Whatever she's got plan
for Gotham ends today.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
You don't even know where she is.

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,440
No. But I put a tracker in Dodgson.

44
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,720
I know where he is and she likes
to keep her toys close.

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Bruce doesn't have
night vision goggles?

46
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,600
Batman doesn't do goggles.

47
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,480
{\an5}Forgetting pain is convenient.

48
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,480
{\an5}Remembering it, agonizing.

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,520
{\an5}But recovering the truth
is worth the suffering.

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,040
{\an5}Now, tell me the truth.

51
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,760
What did you reveal to her?

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,440
{\an5}Nothing. I wouldn't betray you.

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Good.

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,520
{\an5}Because if you ruin
all I have been working for

55
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,920
Off. With. Your. Head.

56
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,600
It looks like my dear sister
wasn't very kind to you, was she?

57
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
It's only a matter of time
before she gets hers.

58
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,360
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I'm not afraid of you.

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,920
Show yourself.

60
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,320
Kinky, even for you.

61
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,760
{\an5}Stealing skin off corpses?
Sadistic even for you.

62
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,120
{\an5}Key word, corpses.
I didn't hurt anyone.

63
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,440
What's the skin for?

64
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,960
You hit three morgues
in one night.

65
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,080
You're working on something.

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,760
Dodgson said you had plans
with a "Mouse".

67
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,240
{\an5}Oh, I'm sure he said
lots of silly things

68
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,840
{\an5}when your attention-starved
step-sister illegally drugged him

69
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,680
Is Mouse a real person
or a figment of your imagination?

70
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,240
And what are you two planning?

71
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,880
{\an5}If you keep going down this road,
it's going to end badly.

72
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,240
{\an5}But it doesn't have to.

73
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,040
{\an5}I can get you into
a rehabilitation hospital.

74
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,440
A real one, Beth.

75
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,960
Nice try, but Alice will do.

76
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,800
You're gonna have to give me
something.

77
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,080
{\an5}Mouse is the one who found me
after the crash.

78
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,480
You do remember the crash?

79
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,040
- What happened to you?
- Aren't you the great detective?

80
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,080
Figure it out.

81
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,960
- What are you doing?
- Calling Dad.

82
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Just telling him know I'm with you.

83
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,800
But he'll track your phone.

84
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,240
And if he finds us
he'll ruin all our fun.

85
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,520
And he'll send you
straight to Arkham.

86
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
- <i>Kate?</i>
- Hi, Dad. I'm with Alice.

87
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,360
What do you mean you're with Alice?

88
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,720
I have her.

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,080
Where are you? I'll send a team.

90
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,880
I'm fine. She's contained.

91
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,680
- I just thought you should know.
- <i>Kate.</i>

92
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,240
Clock's ticking. Start talking.

93
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,200
Fine. But I'll have to show you.

94
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,320
Show me? I don't think so.

95
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,720
The clock's tick, tick, ticking.

96
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:41,120
Let me down and I'll tell you
all about my long, sad tale.

97
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,200
So where to begin?

98
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,240
I suppose it started...

99
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,920
14 months before Catherine
Hamilton faked my death.

100
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,160
What are you talking about?

101
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,760
No one told you. That is so them.

102
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Those bones, they belonged to a deer.

103
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,120
Our stepmother
faked my DNA results

104
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,640
and Daddy just found out
he had a funeral for Bambi.

105
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,160
I wonder if they have a prenup.

106
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,920
The bones at Miller Farm.

107
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
You don't seem that surprised.

108
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,160
Is that because deep down
you always knew

109
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,320
those bones weren't mine?

110
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
And now you know why.

111
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,640
Am I supposed to turn
at somewhere?

112
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,760
You're not asking
the right questions, Kate.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,440
What is my evil plan?
Who am I targeting next?

114
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,280
How am I going to do it?

115
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,200
When you really need to be
asking, why?

116
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,840
Why am I like this?

117
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,120
Okay, why?

118
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,680
Oh, you don't wanna know that.

119
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,640
I have waited 15 years to hear it.

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,560
Well, it all began
with an unfortunate event

121
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,840
of which I remember vividly.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,360
And if given the chance again,

123
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,240
I will take it back in a heartbeat.

124
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,120
It was a simple, effortless thing

125
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,600
that I had done so many times before.

126
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,760
I woke up.

127
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,840
Dad? She woke up.

128
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,280
Oh, hi.

129
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,640
You must be terrified.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,040
What's your name?

131
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,480
Beth. Where am I?

132
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,600
Hello, Beth. You're okay.

133
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,840
My son Johnny and I
were fishing in the river

134
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,720
and we saw you along the rocks.

135
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,760
- Any idea how you got there?
- Where's my mom?

136
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,960
Well, the police will be here soon.

137
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,320
I'm sure they can call her.

138
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,800
No, she was in the car with me.
She needs help.

139
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
It's going to be okay.

140
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
- All right? Are you hungry?
- I want my dad.

141
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,200
I'll make you a sandwich.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,080
The little boy just sat there
with his hair in his eyes,

143
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,280
playing with his trucks.

144
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,520
For him, it was an ordinary day.

145
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,040
But for me, it was
the first worst day of my life.

146
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,160
- What's the man's name?
- Oh, I have no idea.

147
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,200
What do you mean you have no idea?
He rescued you.

148
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,040
It'll make more sense when we arrive.

149
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,960
Go down the road a mile,
take a right.

150
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,560
Go two miles
and there's a roadside dinner.

151
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,080
Consider it your first stop
down the rabbit hole.

152
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,520
It doesn't make sense.

153
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
Why would she call you
and not tell you where she was?

154
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
No idea.
She knows I'll trace the call.

155
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,960
Maybe that was her intention.
We should get a team together.

156
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,320
No. No.
For now, it's just you and me.

157
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,880
Sir, it's Alice.

158
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,560
I don't need to read you her resume.

159
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,840
And I don't need another stand-off

160
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,280
like we had in Burnside Park.

161
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,200
Found her, she's heading west
on the interstate.

162
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,320
Let's go.

163
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,520
I don't get it.

164
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,400
How could they mix up
animal bones and human ones?

165
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,560
I mean the bone density alone
should've tipped them off.

166
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,200
Not to mention the fact
the genome are...

167
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,600
Because it wasn't a mix up.

168
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,040
It was a lie.

169
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,800
Are you covering up
for the lab's mistake?

170
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,840
Mom, you don't have to do that.

171
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,240
Okay, you can just
tell me the truth. We can...

172
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,720
I am. I was trying to give Jacob
and Kate closure.

173
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,840
No, you wouldn't do that

174
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
because that would be,
that would be horrible.

175
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,480
I am so sorry, Mary.

176
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,880
But I wanted you to hear it
from me.

177
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,760
Not from Jacob or Kate. From me.

178
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,320
I know you, okay? I know you.

179
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,200
So please tell me you didn't do this.

180
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,840
- Two beers, please.
- None for me.

181
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,560
You do not want to be sober
for the remainder of the story.

182
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,880
Trust me.

183
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,040
Just the one beer.

184
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,120
Right back with that.

185
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,480
We're here. Talk.

186
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
And what does this place
have to do with anything?

187
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,080
Well, when your life unfolds
into a nightmare,

188
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,600
you pray your dreams
will take you elsewhere.

189
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,040
I used to dream of running away
with you to a place like this.

190
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,440
And then my hunger would wake me.

191
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,760
Alas, it wasn't to meant be.

192
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,200
This would be entirely easier
with two free hands.

193
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,280
You're my sister, Alice.

194
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
We spent half our lives together.

195
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,440
Where did that person go?

196
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,320
Down, down, down the rabbit hole.

197
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:33,120
Look, I'm done messing around.
If you're gonna talk, talk.

198
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,840
If not, we will just sit here
and wait for Dad to find us.

199
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,600
As I was saying, I remember it
like it was yesterday.

200
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,080
The toys. The books. The treats.

201
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,200
Upstairs, there was a room
like a child's wonderland.

202
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,080
It was Mouse's room.

203
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,720
Goonies never say die!

204
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,160
He went by Johnny then.

205
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,520
It's leviosa, not leviosar.

206
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,080
I can do any voice I hear.

207
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,320
You kids want lemonade?

208
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,840
Why do you cover your face
like that?

209
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,280
To hide what happened
in the accident.

210
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,920
You shouldn't have to hide
who you are.

211
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,320
- I'll scare people.
- You don't scare me.

212
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,800
<i>We interrupt this program
with breaking news.</i>

213
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,680
<i>Police announced earlier that
they've expanded their search</i>

214
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,280
<i>for the missing Kane girl
to the county of Bludhaven.</i>

215
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,920
Wait, your dad said
he called the police,

216
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,120
why don't they know I'm here?

217
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,880
<i>The family says a reward
is being offered for any tips...</i>

218
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,160
Johnny, no more TV today.

219
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,160
They're looking for me.
We have to call the police.

220
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,960
I told you, Beth,
they'll be here soon.

221
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,440
We don't want you to leave us.

222
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,640
- Please let me go!
- Dad!

223
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,040
- You're hurting me! Let me go!
- Stay here!

224
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,720
- Please! Let me go!
- Dad!

225
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,960
Let me go!

226
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,560
Stop it, please. Aw! Stop, please.
Let me go for now, please.

227
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,040
No, no! Let me out!

228
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,000
No. Let me out!

229
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,280
And that was just the first day.

230
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,200
I think she'll take that drink now.

231
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,040
Kate? Kate, I need to talk to you!

232
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,600
- Okay? I hate her too! Kate?
- Here she is.

233
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,840
Wouldn't stop trying to buzz in,

234
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,480
insisting she's related to Miss Kane.

235
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,440
- I am.
- And...

236
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,000
I'll take it from here. Thanks, Carl.

237
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,160
Can I help you?
Possibly to an AA meeting?

238
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,080
That depends. Is your name Kate?

239
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,720
Most definitely not.

240
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,360
Then can you tell her that I'm here?

241
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,680
I'm sorry, who's here?

242
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,040
Mary. Kate's soon-to-be
ex-stepsister.

243
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,680
- And you are?
- Luke.

244
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,680
Kate's associate
assistant, real estate person.

245
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,120
Look, Kate's not here.

246
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,560
You know what,
you could leave her a message.

247
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Okay.

248
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,440
Tell her...

249
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,720
that I'm so sorry I was ever born
from the wicked witch of Gotham.

250
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,560
And I get why she's avoiding me,
but I'm totally on her side.

251
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,960
I can't believe that my mom
would ever do something so awful.

252
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,280
Oh, my god.

253
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,280
Do you think that she killed
that deer too?

254
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,760
Are you getting any of this?

255
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,200
All I heard was that your mom may
or may not have killed a deer.

256
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,040
It's probably best that I start
from the beginning.

257
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,280
Sir, I know this is completely
inappropriate for a subordinate

258
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,520
to ask her commander.

259
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,040
But are you okay?

260
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,840
Catherine and I are going through
a rough patch.

261
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,560
Copy that, sir. My apologies.

262
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,120
I was under the impression
that it had something

263
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,520
- to do with Alice.
- As it turns out, it does.

264
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,840
Catherine paid the DNA analyst

265
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,800
to say the skull fragments found
were Beth's.

266
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,760
And they weren't?

267
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,720
And I just confirmed
she was responsible

268
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,000
for the bomb in the lower bridge,
targeting Alice.

269
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,520
Damn.

270
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,120
So Kate was right this whole time.

271
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,080
We don't know what's right.

272
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,960
The only way to settle this
for good is to catch Alice,

273
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,200
run her DNA and...

274
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,440
And let science tell us the truth.

275
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,240
Kate's signal stopped moving.

276
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,000
Looks like they're at some place
called Dusty's.

277
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:10,200
- So good. Sure you don't wanna...
- Why?

278
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,760
I think the beef is grass-fed.

279
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,640
Why was there a face in the sink?

280
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,160
- Oh, that.
- I'm serious, Alice.

281
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,320
You survive a crash,
wash up on shore,

282
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,600
some Hannibal Lector finds you,
keeps you as his prisoner.

283
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,520
Did he wanna kill you?

284
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,480
Skin you? What?

285
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,840
I wasn't a prisoner.

286
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,960
Then what were you?

287
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,200
I was a friend.

288
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,600
<i>Friend, I've learned,
takes on a different meaning,</i>

289
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,360
<i>depending on who you ask.</i>

290
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,400
Socialization is essential
to one's development.

291
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,600
It's as important as food,
water, and shelter.

292
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,600
It allows one to develop
a sense of self.

293
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,920
A sense of purpose.

294
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,840
What is that?

295
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,440
A little experiment.

296
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,560
You see...

297
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,960
My dear son
didn't get the opportunity

298
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,560
to develop a sense of purpose

299
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,880
because the world
made him an outcast.

300
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,880
They called him a monster.

301
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,440
He waited a very long time
for someone like you.

302
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,680
I just wanna go home.

303
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,120
This is your home now.

304
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,600
I want my dad.

305
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,680
Don't cry.

306
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,560
You'll get used to it here.

307
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,200
Dad! Dad! Daddy!

308
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,640
Little Johnny
didn't have any friends...

309
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,760
And then I came along.

310
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,640
- What was he using the skin for?
- Experiments.

311
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,080
Trying to hide Mouse's hideous face.

312
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,840
He thought he could find a way
to make him look normal.

313
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,440
The ridicule would end,
and he'd live happily ever after.

314
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,040
So the skin at the morgue...

315
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,680
What were you...

316
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,960
What am I what, Kate?

317
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,560
Go on. Speak up.

318
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,040
Oh, no, don't tell me
you're a lightweight.

319
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,600
What's wrong, dear sister?

320
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,360
What did you do to me?

321
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,720
Come out, come out, Commander.

322
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,320
Dodgson.

323
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,760
There's a propane tank on the east.

324
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll distract them.

325
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,680
Keep your asses on the ground.

326
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,800
Where's my daughter? Where is she?

327
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,080
Which one?

328
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,720
What the hell happened to you?

329
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,040
You happened, Commander.

330
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,440
I joined the Crows
to make Gotham better.

331
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,720
But you divided it.

332
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,240
The city's not safe,
the wealthy are safe.

333
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,920
And you're too blind to see it.

334
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,560
Just like you're too blind
to see your own daughter.

335
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,560
Sir.

336
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,840
Sir! Sir! Stop, Sir.

337
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,080
Commander, come on.

338
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,720
Didn't have to be this way,
Commander.

339
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,960
You could've saved her.

340
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,520
I mean, god.

341
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,840
Kate knew this whole time
that Beth was alive.

342
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,880
You know, that celestial
sisterly bond is real, man.

343
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,320
Actually, that's really heavy.

344
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,920
Wow, that just made me dizzy.

345
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,440
- Let me call you a car.
- To take me where?

346
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,640
The penthouse built on lies
of falsely dead children?

347
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,760
Hard pass.

348
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,560
Look, I get that you're going
through a lot right now,

349
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,800
but Kate is obviously not here,
and I'm really trying to work.

350
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,720
Seriously, Luke,

351
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,120
I am going through a major family
crisis here, okay?

352
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,160
I don't even know
who my own mom is anymore.

353
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,960
I just found out
I have a second step-sister.

354
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:28,240
Kate found her actual full sister.

355
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, my god. Wait.

356
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,560
- Is Kate with Alice right now?
- If I say "yes", will you leave?

357
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,800
Here I am at the literal lowest
point that I have ever been

358
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,800
Kate decides to choose today,
of all days,

359
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,440
to go out for some sisterly bonding

360
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,800
with a cold blooded killer?

361
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,320
Meanwhile, how many
people have I murdered?

362
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,960
- What?
- Guess.

363
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,240
How many people have I killed?

364
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,280
It's between zero and why are you
even hesitating right now?

365
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,280
Zero. I killed zero people.

366
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,720
I'm the good sister.

367
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,760
You found the tracker, didn't you?

368
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,360
- You knew I'd come for you.
- Yes, I found the tracker.

369
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,560
I knew a few morgue thefts
would stir you into action,

370
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,400
arranged for a friend
to drug your drink,

371
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,280
and now I've taken you
out of the equation.

372
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,680
You see, my dearest Mouse and I

373
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,480
were cooking up a little
something special for Gotham,

374
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,880
and it will undoubtedly
go down more smoothly

375
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,560
without a bat in the broth.

376
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,440
Let me go, Alice.

377
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,160
But we haven't gotten to
the best part of the story yet.

378
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Alas, after weeks
and weeks in captivity,...

379
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,600
Like a little rabbit
down a hole so small...

380
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,160
I finally managed

381
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,600
to claw my way out.

382
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,920
<i>It's curious,</i>

383
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,720
<i>but there are so many
out of the way things</i>

384
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,840
<i>that when one becomes desperate,
present themselves.</i>

385
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,360
<i>I found one such opportunity
in a rusty little friend.</i>

386
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,920
<i>Oh, dear, oh, dear,
my poor delicate fingers.</i>

387
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,040
<i>But success,
I eventually did make mine.</i>

388
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,920
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Daddy, it's me, Beth.

389
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,160
You have to help.

390
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,400
<i>Beth? Oh, my god, Beth.
Where are you?</i>

391
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,680
If anyone comes looking for you,
I will kill them.

392
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,160
And it will be all your fault.

393
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,680
Do you understand me?

394
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,320
I remember that call.

395
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,520
My first and last chance at freedom.

396
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,360
Dad had it traced.

397
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,880
After all that time,
there were so many false leads.

398
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,920
The GCPD didn't believe us,

399
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,800
said they'd already searched
these areas several times.

400
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,160
But we were here within an hour.

401
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,240
You stay here.

402
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,320
Where is she?

403
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,680
Mr. Kane, there's been
a terrible misunderstanding...

404
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,880
- Where is my daughter?
- Sir, please allow me to explain.

405
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,640
My daughter Beth called me
not one hour ago from this house.

406
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,120
She said "help", clear as can be.

407
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,760
It was all an insensitive prank.

408
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,840
I'm... I'm... I'm so embarrassed.
I do...

409
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,520
Mr. Kane, your daughter
is not in there.

410
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,160
Beth? Beth?

411
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,320
Beth?

412
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,320
Beth, are you in here?

413
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,640
Mr. Kane, like I said, it was my son.

414
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,000
He has an ability.
I guess you'd say for mimicry.

415
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,920
Johnny, please show him
what you did.

416
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,280
I don't want to.

417
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,800
- Show him what you did.
- I said I don't want to.

418
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,960
Show him!

419
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,960
Hi, Daddy. It's me, Beth.

420
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,120
I learned a new song on my cello

421
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,720
that I can play
on the first night of Hanukkah.

422
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,680
Here, let me show you.

423
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,000
That's impossible.

424
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,280
How do you know
what her voice sounds like?

425
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,640
He saw a home video clip
on the nightly news.

426
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,480
He's been obsessed
with her disappearance

427
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,720
since it happened.

428
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,280
<i>If anyone comes looking for you,
I will kill them.</i>

429
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,400
Beth?

430
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,680
I was there.

431
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,760
He told me if I made a peep...

432
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,440
That he'd kill you both.

433
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,400
So I just waited.

434
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,840
I waited for you to feel it,

435
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,080
to know, to sense.

436
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,120
But alas, nothing.

437
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,160
I guess what they say
about twins being connected

438
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,800
that profound, soulful,
magical tie, is just fantasy!

439
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:26,080
The thing you dream about
before your hunger wakes you up.

440
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,640
I've lost Kate's location, Sir.

441
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,240
She must have turned off her phone.

442
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,480
- Sir?
- I've been out there before.

443
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,000
Fifteen years ago.

444
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,040
Sir, what's happening?

445
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,760
I know where they are.

446
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,160
Hi, Kate. Me again.
Fifth time now, actually.

447
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,520
Still got that big showing
with that big buyer.

448
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,560
Urgent, real urgent.
I need you to call me back asap.

449
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,800
Hey, hey!

450
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,200
Wow, what the hell is this?

451
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,600
Alice hit up three morgues
last night.

452
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,640
Stole flesh from a bunch
of dead bodies.

453
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,520
Oh, my god. Alice is the skin pirate?

454
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,880
- Of course she is.
- I know, I know.

455
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,480
You've skinned zero corpses.

456
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,200
Well, I haven't.

457
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,520
Is it disgusting
that this is making me

458
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,160
really hungry for pizza?

459
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,240
Yes, that is absolutely disgusting.

460
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,680
Here check this out,
I found something.

461
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,280
Two weeks ago, a guy
named Jonathan Cartwright,

462
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,480
who admitted to having
a similar hobby

463
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,200
of stealing skin from dead people,

464
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,920
- escaped in the Arkham breakout.
- What Arkham breakout?

465
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,840
There was a breakout at Arkham.

466
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,680
I'm pretty sure, I would have
heard about something like that.

467
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,200
But you didn't, so...

468
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,440
So Arkham officials
covered it up. Comforting.

469
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,240
Do you think this creep
has something to do with Alice?

470
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,960
I think the timing
feels incredibly suspicious.

471
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,960
I got the front, you take the back.

472
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,400
Sir, a couple of shacks in the back.

473
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,120
- Checking them out.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

474
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,120
Hi, Daddy.

475
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,320
Where's Kate?

476
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,520
"Where's Kate?"

477
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,600
"Is Kate okay?" "Is Kate happy?"
"Is she sleeping enough?"

478
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,200
"Did she done her homework?"
"Seen a doctor?"

479
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,360
"Had enough to eat."

480
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,480
Kate. Kate. Kate. Kate. Kate.
I'm so sick of Kate.

481
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,240
What are you doing?

482
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,640
Where's Beth?

483
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,360
When was the last time
you uttered those words,

484
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,880
Commander Crow?

485
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,080
Was it here?

486
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,920
- Was it in this house?
- Come on. Don't do this.

487
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,280
Is it when I called you

488
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,640
and you didn't even believe
it was me.

489
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,960
Let's go outside. We'll talk.

490
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:13,240
You told your men to kill me.

491
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,600
Put down the knife.

492
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,760
Because you don't care.
You've never cared.

493
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,880
Put down the knife.

494
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,600
- You give up on me.
- Beth, drop the damn knife.

495
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,160
Beth.

496
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,760
You, you said it.

497
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,360
- Sophie.
- Kate!

498
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,560
Sophie, I'm in here. Hurry.

499
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,960
Hey, I need some...

500
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,000
What the hell?

501
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,160
There's a guy in the shed.
His face, I...

502
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,600
I know who he is.

503
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
Drop it.

504
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,360
You need to decide right now
what you care more about.

505
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,760
Revenge or Mouse?

506
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,160
I said drop it
or the next one goes in his head.

507
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,800
Two can play this game.

508
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,000
Sister, we both know
you don't have it in you.

509
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,240
But I do.

510
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,200
I suppose killing Daddy

511
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,840
would be all too easy
and no fun at all.

512
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,600
Let us all walk out of here.

513
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,240
And no one has to die today.

514
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,480
Dad?

515
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,160
Kate, it's her.

516
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,200
It's Beth.

517
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,640
So, it has been an experience,
but your Chariot has arrived.

518
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,880
2015 hybrid hatch-back.
Power everything.

519
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,120
Four point three stars.

520
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,720
- I can take a hint.
- Wasn't really hinting.

521
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,480
If Kate calls, can you just tell her

522
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,880
that I'm sorry for everything.

523
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,040
Sure.

524
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,360
Maybe if I go kill someone,
she'll actually call me back.

525
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,560
Only one way to find out.

526
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,280
<i>I thought if I let Alice
tell her story,</i>

527
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,480
<i>the puzzle would fit together.</i>

528
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,120
<i>But the pieces are grim,
grotesque, inhuman,</i>

529
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,960
<i>and it's my fault.</i>

530
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,160
<i>I was there and didn't feel her.
I'm her sister, Bruce.</i>

531
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,880
<i>How am I supposed
to connect with her now</i>

532
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,320
<i>when I couldn't connect
with her then?</i>

533
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,960
Shouldn't you be in the hospital?

534
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,240
You know I hate hospitals.

535
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,640
<i>What if I don't know my sister
well enough to save her?</i>

536
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,200
<i>What if nobody does?</i>

537
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,800
While Alice may have been
forced to flee,

538
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,560
in the end, she got the cheese.

539
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,560
You didn't visit me.

540
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,000
My dearest Mouse.

541
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,320
We both know
if I had shown up to Arkham

542
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,600
with a freshly baked pie,

543
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,880
I would've no sooner been
locked in a cell myself.

544
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,440
But you felt me in your dreams?

545
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,520
Every night.

546
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,640
Twined in memory's mystic band.

547
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,280
- Beth.
- Go away.

548
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,800
I shouldn't have tricked your dad
and sister. I'm sorry.

549
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,000
- I wanna go home.
- You know he won't let you.

550
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,280
But you can. You can let me out.

551
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,480
Maybe, but...

552
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,520
I also don't want you to go.

553
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,520
I wanna be your friend.

554
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,080
To keep you company.

555
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,480
Mouse, do you know
the way out of this pool?

556
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,000
I'm very tired of swimming
in my own tears.

557
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,120
I do know a way.

558
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,760
I will help you
escape your pool of tears.

559
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,400
And you did.

560
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,480
You saved me.

561
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,080
I have a gift for you too.

562
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,040
- I love you, Alice.
- I love you too, dear brother.

563
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,800
And now that we are together again,

564
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,040
I can help you become
anyone you want to be.

565
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,080
And once we are done with Daddy...

566
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,720
He will never forget about me.

567
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,800
Ever, ever again.

568
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,920
Are we mad?

569
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,640
I'm afraid so.
