1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,320
You got it?

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,200
Looks like there's no room
for you girls.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,560
Well, I guess we'll just have
to give a few

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,000
of these presents away
to make room in the back.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,080
- Very funny, Daddy.
- We can go with Mom.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,240
Oh, I see.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,040
Now, that you're officially
young women...

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,360
you're making your own decisions.
Understood.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,120
Then, I will see you both
at home.

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,200
- Great party, honey.
- Love you.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,960
- You too.
- See you at home.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,520
Now, there was one gift
that couldn't fit in his car.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,640
- Awesome.
- It's our birthstone.

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,000
Red is a very symbolic color.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,160
It's the color of love.

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,760
But it's also the color
of passion, courage, war.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,760
At one point or another,

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,120
you're going to have to wrestle
with all of these emotions.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,360
And what defines your character
is how you balance them.

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,480
So keep me close to your heart...

21
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,320
because I'll be thinking of you
when I wear mine.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,920
<i>Mazel tov.</i>

23
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,720
Come here.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,520
I'm so proud of you.

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay, I don't see your car.

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,680
Can you flash your lights
or something?

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,880
A creepy guy is following me.

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,080
Oh, what?

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,160
You won't even talk with me?

30
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,240
Just leave me alone.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,840
No one with those legs wants
to be left alone.

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,520
Come on. I'm friendly.

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,560
- I'm not.
- This just became a party.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,200
You okay?

35
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,480
- What a dick.
- Oh, my God.

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,520
I'd ask for a selfie, but I think
you're needed elsewhere.

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Next time.

38
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,120
Cartwright.

39
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,000
What couldn't you tell me
over the phone?

40
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,800
I need you to promise
you won't kill him.

41
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,120
- Kill who?
- Yeah, didn't sound like a promise.

42
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,880
Kate, open the damn door.

43
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,560
{\an5}- How did you find him?
- He was left.

44
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,720
By whom?

45
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,640
I will tell you everything,
but first,

46
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,240
{\an5}I need you to drink this.

47
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
Kate.

48
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,560
{\an5}Drink it. Trust me.

49
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,520
I think Alice found him
and left him for me.

50
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,760
{\an5}- Alice is dead.
- That's the thing. She's not.

51
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,080
Mouse?

52
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
{\an5}Mouse, where are you?

53
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,120
{\an5}Oh, dear, I shall be too late.

54
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,160
Stay away from me.

55
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,360
{\an5}Mouse. It's me, the Caterpillar
told me where to find you.

56
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,240
{\an5}You're dead. You're dead.

57
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,000
You're dead!

58
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,360
- Help!
- Mouse!

59
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,840
Cartwright thought he killed me.

60
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
But he was wrong.

61
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,800
It was someone else.
Another woman who fooled you.

62
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,680
- I'm here now.
- What's the secret password?

63
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,680
"Are there any lions
and tigers about here?"

64
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,960
"It's only the Red Queen snoring."

65
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
See?

66
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,480
It's me.

67
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,400
Your beloved sister.

68
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,240
{\an5}Now, what is this place?

69
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,560
{\an5}This...

70
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,840
{\an5}- This used to be her house.
- Whose house?

71
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
The Queen.

72
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,400
{\an5}The Queen of Hearts.

73
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,760
You've moved your things
out of the attic?

74
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,480
How long is she gonna be
staying with us?

75
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,320
Johnny, that's no way to talk.

76
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,280
Your grandmother can't
live on her own anymore.

77
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,960
Put that bucket away, Alice.

78
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Alice!

79
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,480
The bucket goes away.

80
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, sorry.

81
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,280
It's fine, stay inside.
I'll just pull this thing

82
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,120
through the cold myself.

83
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Hello, Mother.

84
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
Welcome home.

85
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Your dear mother is
carting an oxygen tank

86
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,240
and you greet her
with an open flame?

87
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,040
I can take a hint.

88
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,560
And who is this handsome
young boy?

89
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Hi, Grandma.

90
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,960
Johnny, get your grandmother's
bags.

91
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,600
You fixed his scar beautifully.

92
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,240
When are you going to fix this?

93
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Mother, you're still as
beautiful as can be.

94
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,280
And this must be the girl.

95
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,480
My name is Alice,
so please, your Majesty.

96
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,520
Well, aren't you a curious thing

97
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,440
with your milky, young complexion.

98
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,360
I like your purse.

99
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,240
And I like your necklace.

100
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,480
Where did you get that?

101
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,600
Oh, I don't actually remember.

102
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,600
I saw Beth's body. She was dead.

103
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,800
I know what you saw.

104
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,440
All that matters is
that it wasn't our Beth.

105
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,440
Well, what are you saying,
that the girl on that metal slab

106
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,920
- was an imposter?
- Or another Skin Pirate minion.

107
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,640
Gotham has seen crazier things.

108
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,880
In fact, there's one
right in front of us now.

109
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,560
Turns out the bastard
who makes faces in his basement

110
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,760
also masquerades around
Gotham's elite

111
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,560
as the city's beloved
plastic surgeon.

112
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,000
Right under our nose.

113
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,040
We need to call the GCPD
and get him arrested.

114
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Based on what?

115
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,720
Some crazy horror story
you and I tell

116
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
the very same Police Commissioner

117
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,920
who wrongly accused me of murder
no less than four months ago?

118
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,280
It's the truth.

119
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,560
Which can only
be corroborated by a lunatic

120
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,280
who everyone in Gotham
thinks is dead.

121
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,400
We need to think this through.

122
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,800
What do you suggest?
We kill him, bury his body

123
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,960
and go on with our lives?

124
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,720
Rise and shine,
you son of a bitch.

125
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,320
I was expecting Alice.

126
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,720
Well, you got one meaner.

127
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,880
Do you want me to start
with your nose or your kneecaps?

128
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,920
Who is Mommy Dearest?

129
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,800
Alice is playing games
against the master of games.

130
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,440
I'm not going to let her win.

131
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,360
You don't know Alice like I do.

132
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,600
I know I've spent the last
six years fooling Gotham...

133
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,520
your late wife...

134
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,280
and the both of you.

135
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
What is the Caterpillar doing?

136
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,200
Why would your own father
lock you here

137
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,920
and poison you like this?

138
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,080
He wanted me to see the truth.

139
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,080
What are you talking about?

140
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,160
The toxin...

141
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,520
He wanted me to unlock
my greatest fear.

142
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,920
And as it turns out,
you psychotic bitch...

143
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,880
my greatest fear is you.

144
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,400
Mouse, stop.

145
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,880
What are you doing?

146
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,480
You destroyed our family.

147
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,160
And now, your greatest fear

148
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,760
- No.
- will destroy you.

149
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,080
No.

150
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,440
No.

151
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Kill...

152
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,480
Off with your head!

153
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,120
So pop by in a week and we'll see
how you're healing, okay?

154
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,360
- Thank you.
- Of course.

155
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,800
So, this is the clinic
I've heard so much about.

156
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,960
You're here. Good.

157
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,840
So I called
because I have Beth news.

158
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
- Where's Kate?
- Figured you'd also call her.

159
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,800
Aren't you, like, her keeper?

160
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
Aren't you, like, her sister?

161
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,520
I got us a lead on Beth's murderer.

162
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,160
- That guy killed Beth?
- No.

163
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,840
He came in for a flu shot
but he saw our flyer.

164
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,120
- Mr. Dog.
- Just Mad Dog.

165
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,600
Yeah, well,
just tell him what you told me.

166
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,680
I saw the car y'all looking for.

167
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,120
- Okay, this seems legitimate.
- Where was it?

168
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Junkyard off the 30 at Green.
Same color, same partial plates.

169
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,320
You didn't think
to take a picture, Mad Dog?

170
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,920
- You got a problem with that?
- No. We believe you.

171
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Thank you.

172
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,200
Pretty sure you just gave
a thousand bucks

173
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,480
to a guy with a face tattoo.

174
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,160
He is our first lead
towards finding Beth's killer.

175
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,160
You're really dragging me
to this junkyard.

176
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,360
Technically, you're driving.

177
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,640
After so many years apart...

178
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,680
the only way my son and I
could start our life anew...

179
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,840
was if he believed Alice
was his enemy

180
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,760
who destroyed our family.

181
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
He was quite suggestible to the idea

182
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,920
after I used a little concoction
from an old colleague.

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,320
You may have heard of him.

184
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,800
Dr. Jonathan Crane.

185
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,320
Fear toxin. Scarecrow's MO.

186
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,760
- Triggers your greatest fear.
- And now Alice is his.

187
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,800
Much like the rest of Gotham...

188
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,360
Mouse thinks that Alice is dead.

189
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,320
Seeing his greatest fear
manifested in front of him...

190
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,920
Mouse will undoubtedly snap.

191
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,680
My guess is, by now, he's dosing her

192
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,400
with insurmountable amounts
of the hallucinogen himself.

193
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,320
Unless adrenaline
is administered soon...

194
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,880
she'll be gone forever.

195
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,960
Where is she?

196
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,080
I'll tell you where she is.

197
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,800
In return for my freedom.

198
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,680
Not happening.

199
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,080
Alice, until now, has been focused.

200
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,800
Her plans are always calculated,
pointed.

201
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,360
Collateral damage is minimized.

202
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,280
But this type of chemical
exposure will undo all of that.

203
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,400
Any wisps of sanity
Alice is clinging to

204
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,800
will dissolve in the wind.

205
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,520
If she doesn't jump off
the nearest rooftop, well then...

206
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,320
I imagine
she'll unravel completely...

207
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,720
out herself to Gotham
in the process of going nuclear.

208
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,240
I would hate to be in the
blast radius when that happens.

209
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,960
Dad, stop!

210
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,120
Stop, Dad!

211
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Dad!

212
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,280
If you kill him,
then we are no better than he is.

213
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,480
Not to mention you'll never find out

214
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,520
where Alice is being tortured.

215
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,480
I can only imagine the darkness
she has inside of her.

216
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,000
Though I have a feeling I know
exactly who's paying her a visit.

217
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,840
- Who?
- Mommy Dearest.

218
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,520
- I beg pardon, Your Majesty.
- Put it there, girl.

219
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,240
I was as beautiful as you once.

220
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,320
You're still beautiful, ma'am.

221
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm a circus act

222
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,720
leashed to this can of air
like it's my damn dog.

223
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,200
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

224
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,440
I wasted my life with a man

225
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:44,520
who never loved me
and took too long to die.

226
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,880
Now, not only am I alone,
I'm alone and old.

227
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,560
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

228
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,520
Have you ever made tea, Alice?

229
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
I have.

230
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,320
Then you ought to know how
to keep it from being so sweet.

231
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,680
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

232
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,080
I thought that you wanted it sweet.

233
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,960
You were wrong.
Hold out your hands.

234
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,920
I thought you wanted it sweet.
I thought you wanted it sweet!

235
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,360
I said hold out your hands, girl.

236
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,480
No, no, no.

237
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,000
- No.
- Palms up!

238
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,080
No, I swear I didn't do...

239
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,640
How many times have I told you,
if it's too hot for the hands,

240
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,560
it's too hot for the lips.

241
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,640
You changed your hair.

242
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,920
Why would you change your hair?

243
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,680
No, I kept it short,
just as you like it.

244
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,000
You colored it, it was so pretty.

245
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,840
What did you do, Alice?

246
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,640
You were such a pretty girl.

247
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,120
No, no, please,
I love my hair, please.

248
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,760
- Your hair wants cutting.
- I'm sorry, please, stop it!

249
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,120
No, no.

250
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,520
No!

251
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,480
- We're out of cream.
- I assure you, I brought cream.

252
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,840
Why are we out of cream, Alice?

253
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,920
I'll find some. I'll go now.

254
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,200
I'll find some.

255
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,760
No, no, no.

256
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,320
No, no, no, we can't have run out.

257
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,000
There's no cream.
We haven't any cream.

258
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
What are you doing here?

259
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,480
- Why is this locked?
- Why are you here?

260
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,680
- I need cream for the Queen's tea.
- There's no cream out here.

261
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,520
I'm desperate, she hates me.

262
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,360
- Mother doesn't hate you.
- She does hate me.

263
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,320
Because I am young and beautiful
and she's old and haggard.

264
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,240
It was my mother...

265
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
who siphoned her happiness...

266
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,840
snuffed her spark,
beat her so hard and so often

267
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,880
that eventually, it was easier
for Alice to be numb

268
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
than human.

269
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,680
I imagine, now, in the throes
of Alice's madness...

270
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,440
my mother is once again
calling for her tea.

271
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,760
You threw Beth in a cellar
and taught her

272
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,360
how to carve up faces...

273
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,680
but mommy is the bad guy?

274
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
Nice try.

275
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,720
I am gonna find her and then
I'm gonna skin you alive.

276
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,360
This is his.

277
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,920
Trace it, see if we can find out
where he led Alice.

278
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,920
- How about a glass of water?
- How about not.

279
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,960
Is that why Alice told me to ask
about Mommy Dearest?

280
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,640
Because your mom
was the one who broke her?

281
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,320
She wanted you to hear her story
and get you to kill me.

282
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,400
She wanted to break you, too.

283
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,760
You're wrong.

284
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,280
She knows I would never kill anyone.

285
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Because...

286
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,720
You're so different?

287
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,360
We are different.

288
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,000
Then be merciful.

289
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,120
Give me water.

290
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,840
I'll tell you where she is.

291
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,800
You never knew my real sister.

292
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,200
The girl I grew up with...

293
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,000
was kind and good...

294
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,160
had a soft spot for people

295
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,360
who didn't necessarily
deserve it.

296
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,680
Now, tell me where Alice is.

297
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
You'll never find her.

298
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,040
So you paid a guy a thousand bucks

299
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,600
to tell you there's a car
in a junkyard.

300
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,800
How much will you give me

301
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,280
if I tell you there's sand
at the beach?

302
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,600
Okay, why don't we chase down

303
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,080
one of the leads
that you've generated?

304
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,400
So, you don't happen to have
a cool gadgety thing with you

305
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,640
to help us narrow down
the search, do you?

306
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,160
You know, from work?

307
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,400
I'm sorry, how would
a "real estate gadget"

308
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,600
- help with this exactly?
- Forget it.

309
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,840
Okay, look. Obviously,
Mad Dog was high on something.

310
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,480
And if we put faith
in anything that he said...

311
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,040
we're just as high as he was.

312
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,920
Okay, so if you
were gonna get high...

313
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,640
where would you go?

314
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,280
No idea.

315
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,400
Because I wouldn't.

316
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,760
But if you were,
you would go somewhere

317
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,360
where it was warm.

318
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,440
It's gotta be around here
somewhere.

319
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
There.

320
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,600
That's the only car
that still has its tires on.

321
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
And the color matches.

322
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,120
And the plate's a match.

323
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,280
This is me apologizing
for ever doubting you.

324
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,480
Is that it?

325
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,720
It's the same caliber
that killed Beth.

326
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Hold this.

327
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,560
Hi. I don't know what you're selling,

328
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,600
but, please put me
on your do-not-call list.

329
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,880
Mary, I need your help.

330
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,480
Batwoman?

331
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,720
I am sorry, Batwoman's calling you?

332
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,320
How do I close
a severe neck wound?

333
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,600
- Yours?
- <i>Not mine.</i>

334
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,560
He's a bad guy, I...
He has information that I need.

335
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,000
Can you get him to a hospital?

336
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,160
Would I be calling you if I could?

337
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,680
Right. Okay.

338
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,120
- Is it the carotid artery?
- Carotid artery? Is she okay?

339
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,200
Is the blood flow pulsing?
Rhythmic?

340
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,040
No.

341
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,040
Okay, then it's not
the carotid artery.

342
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,600
But you still need
to close the wound.

343
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,440
Do you have a needle and thread?

344
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
I have a staple gun?

345
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,320
Oh, wouldn't be my first choice.

346
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,800
Okay, here goes nothing.

347
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,680
How do I know if it worked?

348
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,040
Slowly release your fingers
from the pressure point.

349
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,040
Anything?

350
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,360
<i>No, nothing's coming out.</i>

351
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,960
Does he have a pulse?

352
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,320
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

353
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,960
I mean, I think that's a good thing.

354
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,320
You said he was a bad guy.

355
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,120
He still gonna need treatment.

356
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,960
Thanks, Mary. Thanks.

357
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,480
Of course, anytime.
Literally, any time.

358
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,400
I'm here just waiting to be beckoned.

359
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,880
What? What is happening?

360
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,160
Sorry. Doctor-vigilante
confidentiality.

361
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,400
Please. I'm so very tired
of being all alone here.

362
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,440
You're alone because no one cared
enough to find you.

363
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,800
No one came for you then,
and no one will come for you now.

364
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,560
That's not true. That's not true!

365
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,520
- Alice, I'm here.
- Yeah.

366
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,880
- You're here.
- I'm here.

367
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,240
- No one can hurt you...
- Get away from her.

368
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
We can help her.
She can be saved.

369
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,120
She's a lost cause.

370
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,960
And the world is better off
with her dead.

371
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,400
No, no, no.
You know that's not true, Kate.

372
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,840
All the pain, all the misery,
all the hurt, it's because of her.

373
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
You're right.

374
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,560
She's not worth it.
And she never will be.

375
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
No.

376
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,640
Oh, Kate...

377
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
No. No, don't leave me.

378
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,600
Don't leave me, Kate!

379
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,640
Daddy, wait. Kate, stop.
Don't... don't leave me.

380
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,000
Don't leave me again.

381
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,400
Don't leave...

382
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,280
Clearly, you'd rather die
than help me.

383
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
And the longer you sit there...

384
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,040
the less likely those staples
are gonna hold.

385
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,280
and you die anyway.

386
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,880
Looks like you're in a bit
of a conundrum.

387
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,400
You're right. I am.

388
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,640
So I'm gonna give something
to live for, your freedom.

389
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,920
Why do I have a hard time
believing you?

390
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,120
I'm offering you a free pass
out of here.

391
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,320
And the second I tell you
where she is...

392
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,280
what's to stop you
from killing me?

393
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,400
- Me. Because I am not a killer.
- Yet.

394
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,160
You don't know me,
so let me tell you who I am.

395
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,960
I am everything you stripped away
from my sister.

396
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Hope, honor, integrity.

397
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,440
I am what she would've been
if not for you.

398
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,720
I am giving you an out.
Tell me where she is.

399
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,800
<i>She's at 614 Williams Street.</i>

400
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,040
Did he tell you that?

401
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,240
We cut a deal.

402
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,600
Let me know
if he's telling the truth.

403
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
I don't get it.

404
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm not getting any hits
from this license plate.

405
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,640
Are you sure
you entered it right?

406
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,600
Yeah, pretty sure I typed in
all six digits correctly

407
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,240
the first five times I entered them.

408
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,040
What are you doing?

409
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,560
I was just curious about
"The International Periodical

410
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,560
of Technology & Innovation.
Volume Two."

411
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,760
You got a book report due?

412
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,000
Well, I could've finished reading it

413
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,760
in the time it's taken you
to find one license plate.

414
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,800
I thought you were like Kate's
tech guru.

415
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,440
I've been searching
active registrations.

416
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,920
I didn't search inactive.

417
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,040
Yes, okay, I got something.

418
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,200
Okay. So the plates expired
20 years ago.

419
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,320
- Whose car is it?
- Car was last registered to...

420
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,960
- What?
- Mabel Cartwright.

421
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,240
August Cartwright's mother.

422
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,480
We need to call Kate.

423
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,240
I can't... I can't do this again!

424
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,520
I can't be locked away again.

425
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,840
"And she began by taking...

426
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,360
the little golden key...

427
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,840
and unlocking the door...

428
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,960
that led...

429
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,960
into the garden."

430
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,560
No! Alice, please. No.

431
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,520
Get away from me!

432
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,320
- You're not real.
- I'm real... Alice.

433
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
It's me.

434
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,440
- What's that?
- Adrenaline.

435
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:01,320
It's adrenaline.
It nullifies the toxin.

436
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,880
You're okay now.

437
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
Daddy?

438
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,360
Where's Kate?

439
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,760
Waiting outside
with her hand on the door?

440
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,280
She's with Cartwright.

441
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,560
She's the one who got him
to tell us where you were.

442
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,120
And you came running.

443
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
Why?

444
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,760
Because I care.

445
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,480
And to keep you hanging on

446
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,520
to whatever sense
of sanity you have left.

447
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Touching.

448
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,080
Well, I take it
if Cartwright's still alive...

449
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,400
he hasn't gotten
to the part in the story

450
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,120
about Mommy Dearest?

451
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,080
Oh, he told us everything.

452
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,360
His mother sounded like a treat.

453
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,400
His mother?

454
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,120
Is that who you think
this is about?

455
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,840
Where is Mabel right now?

456
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,280
Your sister didn't tell you?

457
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,680
Tell me what?

458
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,480
Mother died years ago.

459
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,120
So you were driving her car.

460
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,760
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

461
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,160
Did you shoot a woman
who you believed to be my sister?

462
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Answer me.

463
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,560
We made a deal.

464
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,320
I talk, I walk out of here alive.

465
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,040
Did you shoot a woman
in a motel parking lot

466
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
who you believed to be Alice?

467
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,720
She looked exactly like her.

468
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,160
The face, the eyes...

469
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,320
Of course you did.

470
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,480
Of course it was you!

471
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,120
I swore it was her.

472
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,600
Even wore a necklace
that matched those damn earrings.

473
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,400
What did you just say?

474
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,000
What necklace matched
what earrings?

475
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:33,840
The ones my mother so coveted
and caused all the problems.

476
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,360
What earrings?

477
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,280
How do they look?

478
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,040
Where did you get those?

479
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,800
They were a gift from my son.

480
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,480
That was the moment I remembered
where I got my necklace.

481
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,880
It was meant to match
Mother's earrings...

482
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,640
So that Kate and I could always
keep her close to our heart.

483
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,920
How did Cartwright know
about Gabi's earrings?

484
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,360
Trust me, Daddy.

485
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,680
Some things...

486
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,080
Are better left.

487
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,840
Alice, tell me
where he got the damn earrings!

488
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,240
Exactly where you think.

489
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,160
My mother wanted a fresh start.

490
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,400
She begged for your mother's face

491
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,120
from the day
I fished it out of the river.

492
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,600
As she got older...

493
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,840
Her obsession only got worse.

494
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,320
I kept pushing it off...

495
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,560
knowing it would cause trouble

496
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,040
once she took on the face
of a dead woman but...

497
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,640
It gave her something
to live for.

498
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Your mother
was a beautiful woman, Kate.

499
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,040
It would've been a pity
for her to go to waste.

500
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,640
The tea's gone cold.

501
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,320
I said I need you to warm this tea.

502
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,000
Consider it a pleasure.

503
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,360
What the hell are you doing?

504
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,640
Long live the queen.

505
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,280
You stole everything from me!

506
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,960
<i>Red is a very symbolic color.
It's the color of love.</i>

507
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,600
<i>It's also the color
of passion, courage, war.</i>

508
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,760
<i>At one point or another...</i>

509
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,600
<i>you're going to have to wrestle
with all of these emotions.</i>

510
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,520
<i>And what defines your character
is how you balance them.</i>

511
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Come on.

512
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,960
Live.

513
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,400
Come on. Live!

514
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,040
Help me.

515
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,320
Oh, no. He can't be dead.
Kate, what did you do?

516
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,920
- Please. Dad, save him.
- Wake up, you son of a bitch!

517
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,360
Kate.

518
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,960
"Oh, I've had such
a curious dream," said Alice...

519
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,320
and she told her sister all these
strange adventures of hers.

520
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,200
and when she had finished,

521
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,160
her sister kissed her and said,

522
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,400
"It was a curious dream, dear.

523
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,840
Now run in to your tea,
it's getting late."

524
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,280
So Alice got up and ran off,
thinking while she ran...

525
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,400
what a wonderful dream
it had been."

526
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,480
Congratulations, Daddy.

527
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,560
Now, both of your daughters
are killers.

528
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,960
Died seven years ago.
Burned to death in a house fire.

529
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,560
Right around the time
Cartwright disappeared.

530
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,520
And the next time he crawls out
of the woodwork,

531
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,320
- he kills Beth.
- We should've seen this coming.

532
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,560
Hey, don't make this harder
by blaming yourself.

533
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,600
That's easier said than done
after watching Beth...

534
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,160
- die in my arms.
- If I know Kate...

535
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,600
she won't rest until she brings
that monster to justice.

536
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,040
<i>I thought I found the balance,
Bruce.</i>

537
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
<i>But I was wrong.</i>

538
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,040
<i>I crossed the line.</i>

539
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,000
<i>And now I'm the very thing
I've been fighting against.</i>

540
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,200
Can I get one on the house?

541
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,040
We're gonna need this
with the night we have ahead of us.

542
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,200
What do you mean?

543
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,240
Last time I checked...

544
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,400
Bodies don't bury themselves.
