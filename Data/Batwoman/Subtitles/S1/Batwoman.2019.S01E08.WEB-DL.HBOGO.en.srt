1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,800
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,360
Bruce never stopped looking
for your sister's body.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,800
Catherine Hamilton's investigators

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,360
found skull fragments
of a little girl.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
It's Beth.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,920
You never would have moved on

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,320
if you didn't think
that Beth were dead.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,280
I paid the DNA analyst
to write the report.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,280
As hard as I have tried
to get over you,

10
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,640
I can't, it's definitely
not fair to Tyler.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,040
Maybe it's best if I keep
my distance from now on.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,200
Daddy.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,640
Catherine seems to think so.

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,280
We are to host the most
memorable mad tea party

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,240
Gotham has ever seen.

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,480
<i>They say the choices
we make define us.</i>

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,400
<i>But despite all the darkness,
despite all those who doubt,</i>

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,200
<i>and despite my own fear
that I've lost my sister forever,</i>

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,280
<i>I choose to hope.
That Beth is still there.</i>

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,200
<i>Don't tell anyone, Bruce,</i>

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,200
<i>but I think this makes me
an optimist.</i>

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,280
- Give me your jacket.
- Wait. What?

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,600
- Give me your jacket.
- This is vintage, bitch.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,880
Okay. Take it, take it, take it.

25
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,440
Vintage.

26
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,720
{\an5}Thanks, not exactly my style.
Or size.

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,880
{\an5}And... Is that blood?
You really shouldn't have.

28
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,680
{\an5}Front right pocket.
Rabbit dropped it in there

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
{\an5}before I made run for it.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,280
{\an5}Think we can use the phone's
GPS to track Alice?

31
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,520
I can try.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,760
{\an5}I see you broke the staff in two.

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,800
Like I won't notice?

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,080
{\an5}Sorry, for the record,
it'd be a whole lot cooler

35
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
{\an5}if it actually came apart.

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,760
{\an5}It doesn't though, so...

37
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
Okay, here's every location
the phone's gone to

38
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,640
- the past seven days.
- Where's this?

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,320
Slice of Gotham.
Worst breadsticks in the city.

40
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,400
But location two
is a little more promising.

41
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,440
It's a warehouse in The Bowery.

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,640
Then that's where she is.

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Don't wait up.

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,760
{\an5}Too sad. Too loud.

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,160
Too mundane. Why?

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,640
Why do I have nothing to wear?

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,840
{\an5}If you're going to kidnap me again

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,960
{\an5}do wait until I can dolly up
into something with...

49
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
a little more flair.

50
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,800
Did you hire The Rifle to kill me?

51
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,520
Says the walking, talking,
living girl.

52
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,040
He shot someone he believed
to be Batwoman

53
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,240
with the coil accelerator.

54
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,400
{\an5}A weapon designed
for only one reason, to kill me.

55
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,120
The guy who designed it was found

56
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,840
with a butterfly knife in his heart.

57
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,800
{\an5}Yeah, let me rephrase that.

58
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,400
{\an5}So an evil man was trying
to kill my twin sister

59
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,600
and I ensured that...
that didn't happen.

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,320
What is this?

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,760
{\an5}That is a multi-million dollar
piece of technology

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,680
{\an5}that allows the coil accelerator
to penetrate your suit.

63
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,800
That's the only one
that exists on the planet.

64
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,800
{\an5}Anyone who knew how to make it
is well exactly that

65
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,240
{\an5}past tense so...

66
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,880
{\an5}You're welcome.

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,680
{\an5}Turn yourself in, Alice.

68
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,800
{\an5}Let me help you.

69
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,520
{\an5}I know my sister is in there.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,680
This again.

71
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,680
You kept this.

72
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,920
From the day of our b'not mitzvah.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,600
{\an5}Take it, and be gone.

74
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,040
{\an5}I am quite busy
and I have nothing to wear.

75
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,640
It's Kane.

76
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,240
I'll be back in Gotham
later tonight.

77
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,760
We'll go over the floor plan
for the gala

78
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,080
{\an5}first thing tomorrow.

79
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,200
Talk then.

80
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,520
So the way I see it,

81
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,720
you can either spend
your Friday night

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,480
in here inhaling asbestos

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,520
or you can join me in wearing

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,720
this season's sexiest
haute couture.

85
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,120
Seriously.

86
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,040
Gigi and Bella could not even
get their hands on this yet.

87
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,560
You want me to go
to that thing tonight.

88
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,440
Okay, that thing is
The Gotham Humanitarian Gala,

89
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,760
i.e. the most important event
of the season.

90
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,200
Honoring your mom, who told
my dad that Beth was dead.

91
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,400
Asbestos it is.

92
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,560
I get that we're bordering on
too soon.

93
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,520
Pretty sure we're right
in the middle of it.

94
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,200
I know that this isn't
important to you.

95
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,920
But it's important to me, okay?

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,200
So, why can't it be important to you

97
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,400
that it's important to me?

98
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,920
Because you think that
if Gotham sees us as a family

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
that we'll start to believe it.

100
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,480
And that's just not how it works.

101
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,640
- Not after what Catherine did...
- You gave Alice a second chance.

102
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,360
And a third. And a fourth.

103
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,880
How can you write off
my mom as Satan

104
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,480
but you don't seem
to have any problem

105
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,400
holding out hope for the actual
most evil person in Gotham.

106
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,760
Because she's my family.

107
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,160
And I'm not. Got it.

108
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,680
I guess I am the crazy one,
you know?

109
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,400
For thinking you and I
could still be sisters.

110
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,600
Of course, you're my family
it's just...

111
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,040
Different. Yeah, do yourself
a favor, stop digging.

112
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,200
Listen, even if I wanted to go,
I could never do that to my dad.

113
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,480
You don't know?
He decided to come tonight.

114
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
For me.

115
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,960
Sorry for thinking
that you would do the same.

116
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,560
You're going to the
Humanitarian Gala?

117
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,080
Yeah, I meant to talk to you
about that.

118
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,520
Unless Catherine somehow
didn't fake Beth's death,

119
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,200
then I don't know what there is
to talk about.

120
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,200
- Are you getting back with her?
- No.

121
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,600
When you've been with someone
for a decade and a half,

122
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,200
you don't just walk away.

123
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,000
You're letting her weasel her way
back into your life...

124
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,920
There's no weaseling, Kate.

125
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,320
We've been spending
some time together.

126
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,800
When? You've been out of town.

127
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,800
Well, you know, we had breakfast
when I got back.

128
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,360
You're seriously forgiving her.

129
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,280
I'm not defending what Catherine did.

130
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,800
She's not either but...

131
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,920
I am beginning to understand
why she did it.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800
As a mother, as a wife.

133
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
She thought she was helping us
move on.

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,080
Wake up, father dear.

135
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,800
Why, what a long sleep you've had.

136
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,240
I thought it was high time

137
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,840
you and I finally had
a daddy-daughter chat.

138
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,880
That is all I want.

139
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,120
But come on.

140
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,400
Not like this.
Let me out of these chains...

141
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,040
You're not the Commander here,

142
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
Commander.

143
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,760
Kate will know I'm gone.

144
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Will she?

145
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,440
Because I saw her last night

146
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,480
and there was nary
a mention of you.

147
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,800
Guess she's oh-for-two
in missing family members.

148
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,360
What do you want me to say?

149
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,320
I'm sorry?

150
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,920
There's no word to describe
what it feels like

151
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,040
to know that I left you behind.

152
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,200
Then find the words to explain

153
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,640
why you never tested the skull
fragments Catherine found.

154
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,400
I had no reason
to think that she was lying.

155
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,160
But your daughter was missing.

156
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,600
And this was just
a handful of bones

157
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,240
found by some woman
you'd known for less than a year.

158
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,760
Maybe believing
that you were dead was easier

159
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,320
than waking up every morning
with hope,

160
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,160
or going to sleep every night
with a broken heart.

161
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,600
Of course,
I should've looked longer,

162
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,000
I should've hoped harder,

163
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,400
I should've, I should've had
the DNA tested myself.

164
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,560
I wish...

165
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,160
I wish I could've been your father

166
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
for the past 15 years. But...

167
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,360
I failed.

168
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,160
I failed you.

169
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,120
Thank you for saying that.

170
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,520
And thank you for making me
who I am today.

171
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,960
What are you planning?

172
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,480
Tell me what to do to stop it.

173
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,400
Today is the day of my mad tea party,

174
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,680
to which you've been invited.

175
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:11,320
I'm fairly certain you'll attend,
and Catherine will be delighted.

176
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,840
But how can that be,
if you're stuck here,

177
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
and still the guest of honor?

178
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,240
I guess you'll see,
as we drink tea...

179
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,640
And someone ends up a goner.

180
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,240
Catherine manipulated my dad
15 years ago,

181
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,040
and here she is, just doing it again.

182
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,320
My dad is the head of the Crows,

183
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,560
I mean, how is he even falling
for this...

184
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,400
Alice has been on a killing spree
since you got back,

185
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,280
and this is what's got you
drinking Bruce's good stuff?

186
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,720
Alice was brainwashed
against her will.

187
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,120
Well, this is different,
my dad, he's choosing...

188
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
He is choosing to forgive
a woman who

189
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,760
lied about the death of his daughter.

190
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,680
Catherine paid a team of scientists

191
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,640
to change DNA results.

192
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,320
My dad once found a joint
in my backpack

193
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,680
and grounded me for a whole summer.

194
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,440
It doesn't make sense,
this is not him.

195
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
This isn't him.

196
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
What am I missing?

197
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,840
If you're calling with a lecture,
I don't have time.

198
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,000
<i>The opposite, actually.</i>

199
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,960
I know complicated
better than anyone else.

200
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,560
And if you want to work things out

201
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,120
with she-who-must-not-be-named...

202
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,120
It's not my business.

203
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,800
Well, I appreciate that, kiddo.

204
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,720
And in thinking about it,
I realize that

205
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
I... I never really gave her
a chance.

206
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,240
<i>Remember the wedding,
the big snowstorm,</i>

207
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,600
and I just kept wishing
that maybe if we got snowed in,

208
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,120
you wouldn't have to get married.

209
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,320
If only a snowstorm
were our biggest hurdle.

210
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,560
Anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry,

211
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
- and have fun tonight.
- Thanks, Kate.

212
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,360
My dad married Catherine
on the hottest day of the year.

213
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,880
- So if that's not your dad, then...
- It's Mouse.

214
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,400
So, you know those vacation days
we banked?

215
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,600
What if we took one of our
old school road trips?

216
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,120
I was thinking down south,
maybe Dollywood.

217
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,960
Sounds cool.

218
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
What is up with you?

219
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,640
I just suggested a road trip
to Dollywood.

220
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,880
Nothing is up with me.

221
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,160
Nothing, or you're pretending
to be cool about Kate and me

222
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,840
and you're obviously still freaked?

223
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,680
Ty, if this is going to be a thing,
we should talk about it.

224
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,120
Sorry to keep you waiting.

225
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,080
I wanted to go over tonight's agenda.

226
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,280
As you know, this is one
of the city's biggest nights,

227
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,600
so I need you two to run point.

228
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,640
Sophie, you take the Alpha team,
cover the interior.

229
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,160
Tyler, you're with Bravo
locking up the perimeter.

230
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,720
Teams are already down in the theater

231
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,960
beginning their sweep.

232
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,320
I want this evening go off
without a hitch.

233
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,200
<i>Good evening, Gotham.</i>

234
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,080
<i>Tonight is the city's
Humanitarian Gala,</i>

235
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,080
<i>which is "rich person"
for "let's dress up</i>

236
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,120
<i>and congratulate each other
on being rich and dressed-up."</i>

237
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,040
<i>And it's all to honor
Hamilton Dynamics'</i>

238
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,880
<i>Matriarch of Munitions,
Catherine Hamilton-Kane.</i>

239
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,960
<i>Not sure how they're gonna fit
a Tomahawk missile</i>

240
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,400
<i>into a swag bag.</i>

241
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,080
So I'm here en route
to the Humanitarian Gala

242
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,200
with the 'rents, what up?

243
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,040
Where mom is being honored
as the Gotham Giver of the Year,

244
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,840
hashtag "proud daughter."

245
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,360
I just want to take a moment and say

246
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,840
how thankful I am for family,

247
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,320
and for sticking by each other
through thick and thin.

248
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,680
That's what's all about.

249
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,800
To Catherine.

250
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,640
A most extraordinary woman.

251
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,400
Cheers.

252
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,640
Must be time to move.

253
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,360
You are becoming incessant.

254
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,000
And you are becoming predictable.

255
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,120
Whatever you have planned
for the Gala,

256
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,680
The Crows are already on it.

257
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,000
Tell me where Dad is.

258
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,240
Or what?

259
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,440
You'll have me arrested?
Institutionalized? Killed?

260
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,960
You hate him. I get it. I would too.

261
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,880
But he did not mean to hurt you.

262
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,520
You keep holding on so tight, like,

263
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,520
to the childish notion that Beth
is still in here.

264
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,080
If Beth is gone,
then why did she keep this?

265
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,920
You saved this for the same reason

266
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,320
you saved me from The Rifle.

267
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,320
Because despite the hate,
the resentment, the rage,

268
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,960
there's still good.

269
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,640
There's still Beth.

270
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,560
So tell me where Dad is.

271
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,840
I left him in the same place
he left me.

272
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,200
Thank you.

273
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Kate?

274
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,040
He's not doing so well,

275
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,800
you might wanna be quick about it.

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hi.

277
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,360
I assume we have everything in order.

278
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,000
Ten-four, Commander. All good here.

279
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,680
Gotta hand it to you, Mouse.
That's impressive.

280
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,200
But if you're not Jacob,
then you're...

281
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,920
Not a Crow, oh, crap.

282
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,240
To date, the Hamilton Foundation
has donated countless millions

283
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,360
to fund work in the health,
emergency relief, poverty,

284
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,280
and education sectors,
both globally and in Gotham.

285
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,120
All of these philanthropic efforts

286
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,480
are spearheaded by Catherine herself.

287
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,760
I can think of no one more deserving

288
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,800
of the Gotham
Humanitarian of the Year Award

289
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,640
than Catherine Hamilton-Kane.

290
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,120
Thank you, Dr. Campbell,
for that wonderful intro,

291
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,840
and to Mayor Akins
and the City of Gotham

292
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,520
for this great honor.

293
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,920
When I took over this company
from my father,...

294
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,720
Tyler.

295
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,240
Tyler.

296
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,640
Wake up!

297
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,000
What happened?

298
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,080
Commander tranq'd us.

299
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,680
What?

300
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,080
Help! We're here!

301
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,280
One-way windows, sound-proof walls.

302
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,760
No one can hear us or see us.

303
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,440
Kate was right.

304
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,160
Alice's new minion
is impersonating Jacob Kane.

305
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,480
I'm still way too drugged up
to process that.

306
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,600
Alice must be planning something
at the gala.

307
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,840
Which is why she took us out.

308
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,360
I thought Alice was more of a...

309
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,200
slit-open-our-necks
and pose-us-for-a-tea party

310
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,360
type of murderer.

311
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,280
Ketamine's a little dull, no?

312
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,760
She didn't want to hurt us.

313
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,560
We're talking
about the same Alice, right?

314
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,680
She's trying to preserve
some sick relationship with Kate,

315
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,080
and killing me would...

316
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,480
Killing you would mean Kate
would never forgive her.

317
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,000
Because Kate's
still in love with you.

318
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,120
I have no idea.

319
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,400
And what about you?
Any idea how you feel?

320
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,520
We should probably figure out
how to get out of here.

321
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,120
Today, Hamilton is a household name

322
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,840
in technology innovation...

323
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,120
Tonight...

324
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,240
You honor me as one
of Gotham's heroes...

325
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,160
An honor that I...

326
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,920
Bought and paid for...

327
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,680
Quite literally, with...

328
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,720
blood money.

329
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,200
My company makes millions
by putting weapons of war

330
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,160
in the hands of Gotham's criminals.

331
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,920
My husband...

332
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,480
rakes in even more
by protecting you from them.

333
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,760
Dad.

334
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,560
Quite the scam we've been running,

335
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,680
wouldn't you say?

336
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,080
What my husband doesn't
want you to know

337
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,320
is that the true villains of Gotham

338
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,600
don't go by the name Joker...

339
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,720
Or Riddler...

340
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,680
Or Alice...

341
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
Gotham's true enemies
are right in front of you.

342
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,400
I...

343
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,240
I... I...

344
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,080
Mom! Oh, my god.

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,720
Orpheum Theater, we need medics.

346
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,240
You hang in there, sweetheart.
You're okay.

347
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,480
Hello?
Something's happened to my mom.

348
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,920
She's breathing, but we need
medical help immediately.

349
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,320
You keep an eye over them
until I get back.

350
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Oh, my god.

351
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,240
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna meet the medical help

352
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
- and bring them here.
- Okay, all right.

353
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,680
- Hang in there, sweetheart.
- Okay.

354
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,680
Oh, my god.

355
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,680
- I don't have a choice.
- It's okay.

356
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,480
Just stay with me.

357
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,840
Stay with me. Help is on the way.

358
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

359
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,360
as we get medics
for Mrs. Hamilton-Kane,

360
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,880
please stay in your seats.

361
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,120
There's no cause for alarm, please.

362
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,200
Everything's under control
stay in your seats.

363
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,880
There's no need to panic.

364
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,080
The Crows are holding us.

365
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,880
Get us out of here.

366
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,840
Okay, I'm in position.

367
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,720
Batwoman is here! Let's pounce.

368
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,280
- A little left.
- Trying.

369
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,200
No. Other one.

370
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,440
- Got it.
- Nice.

371
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,200
I'm really regretting not getting
you a bigger one of these

372
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
in this moment.

373
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,960
- I wouldn't have wanted it.
- Sure you still want this one?

374
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,560
- Tyler.
- It's a little hard to ignore

375
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,320
the irony of using
the engagement ring I got you

376
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,840
to escape your ex-girlfriend's
lunatic sister who didn't kill us

377
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,720
because she knows more
about your past relationships

378
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,640
- than I do.
- What do you wanna know?

379
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,480
What was it between you two?

380
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,200
Don't say it was just
some drunk college hook up

381
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,680
unless you were actually drunk
for three years.

382
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,000
Look...

383
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,720
All my life I've followed the rules.

384
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,760
My family's rules, the Army's rules.

385
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,720
This was the first time I broke one

386
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,680
and it almost cost me everything.

387
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,240
That's why I lied.

388
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,280
You didn't answer my question.

389
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,520
Let's go get some help.

390
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,760
Commissioner, with all due respect,

391
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,240
I need your men to stand down.

392
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,280
She's infiltrated the Crows.
If you breach, we're all dead.

393
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,960
- Why isn't Jacob back?
- He'll be back soon.

394
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,680
Your husband won't be joining you.

395
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Get me the tray.

396
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,480
Catherine, you don't look so well.

397
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,440
You stay the hell away from us.

398
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,080
I'm not the one
you should worried about.

399
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,120
For it was all very well
to say "drink me,"

400
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,400
but you should have first look

401
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,080
to see whether
it's marked "poison" or not.

402
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,720
You poisoned her?

403
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,320
Group effort.

404
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,880
I use the Catherine Hamilton
recipe.

405
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,680
- Project 4782 ring any bells.
- Four-seven-eight-two?

406
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,640
Catherine, do you want to tell her?

407
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,920
I think her internal organs
are liquefying.

408
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,200
I'll just tell you.

409
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,840
It's a deadly neurotoxin designed
to kill without mercy.

410
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,320
First, there are the dizzy spells
and then nosebleeds,

411
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,040
and then comes muscle paralysis,
and, oh, respiratory failure.

412
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,040
But, lucky for us,
Hamilton developed an antidote.

413
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,280
Okay, mother,
you just got to hold on

414
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,760
until we can get that antidote.

415
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,080
Oh, no, my dear,
I'm confusing my stories.

416
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,280
Hamilton never even bothered
to develop an antidote.

417
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,440
If she dies, I'll kill you myself.

418
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,080
She made a choice.

419
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,560
Maybe if she made better choices
in the past,

420
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,440
we wouldn't be here right now.

421
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,920
You're just gonna let her die.

422
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,520
Mary, my darling,
impetuous step sister.

423
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,680
I'm... I'm not a total monster.

424
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,800
No.

425
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,600
- No.
- I found the solution.

426
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,240
A universal cure-all,
all the way from Coryana.

427
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,640
Where's Coryana?

428
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,800
On a map or two.

429
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,880
It's made from the desert rose
that blooms only on the island.

430
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,200
One prick of its thorns
can kill you on the spot.

431
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,960
But harness the flower
and nurture its serum

432
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,520
and it gives your life.

433
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,800
What do you want?

434
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,880
A simple apology.

435
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,320
For all the pain you've cause me.

436
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,280
I'm sorry... Alice.

437
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320
I could just don't believe you.

438
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,560
Get me eyes on Alice and Jacob.

439
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,800
She said she was sorry.

440
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,200
Do you think I enjoy watching
a daughter lose her mother?

441
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
No.

442
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,800
I was just inches
from my own mother's.

443
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,080
Severed head floating
down the Gotham river.

444
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,440
After our car plummeted
off the bridge.

445
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,560
Oh, please...

446
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,960
Please just try.

447
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,480
I can't loose you. Please just try.

448
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,760
I'm a mother.

449
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,800
Alice.

450
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,080
When I saw Kate grieving,...

451
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
I saw my own daughter.

452
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,560
I just wanted to take away
your pain.

453
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
But in trying to take away
Kate's pain,

454
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,200
I gave you a lifetime of it.

455
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,480
It's all my fault, Alice.

456
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,840
All the lost years,
all agony you endured,

457
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,440
It's all my fault. It's all...

458
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,960
I'm truly sorry.

459
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,480
Thank you, Catherine.

460
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,480
I do believe you've earned
a draught of this tea.

461
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,400
- Oh, dear, not you too?
- What?

462
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,720
Oh, what did you do? How did you...

463
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,960
Tell me you didn't both drink
the champagne.

464
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,680
Oh, that's such a shame

465
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,320
it means there's only enough
antidote for one.

466
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,320
Dad drank the champagne, too.
We need to find him.

467
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,120
He'll be fine. He knows better
than to poison himself.

468
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,840
- What?
- He poisoned you, Mary.

469
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,560
Jacob would never hurt us.

470
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,320
Getting closer.

471
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,120
You had someone impersonate him.

472
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,280
What?

473
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,200
The skin pirate.

474
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,760
There was an escapee from Arkham.

475
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,000
That wasn't Jacob in the limo.

476
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,000
There you go.

477
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,680
Now, what were we talking about.

478
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
Yes?

479
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,840
They're choices we make.

480
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,080
Do choose wisely.

481
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,600
Okay.

482
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
If we split it,

483
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,360
maybe there will be enough time
to get to the emergency room.

484
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,480
No, no, Alice,
would have accounted for that.

485
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,200
No, Mom. We have to try.

486
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,080
- Okay, we have to try.
- Mary, listen to me.

487
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,000
- Drink it.
- No, there has to be another one.

488
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,080
Mary, I'm your mom.

489
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,040
- No.
- Drink this. It's okay.

490
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
Did you do it?

491
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,720
<i>Jacob's drugged
and I put him in the SUV.</i>

492
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,400
- Good.
<i>- He doesn't know what happened.</i>

493
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
I have to go.

494
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,240
You're too late.

495
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,360
Where's my dad?

496
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,600
Our dad.

497
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,320
You'll find out soon enough.

498
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,320
Whatever you did, you can undo it.

499
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,800
But I don't wanna undo it.

500
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:44,400
I was locked in a cell for 11 years.

501
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,240
What do you think put me
to sleep at night?

502
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Rainbows? Unicorns?

503
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,440
I dreamt of revenge.

504
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,080
What did you do?

505
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,360
What did you do?

506
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,280
It was all very well
to say "Drink me,"

507
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,760
but the wise little Alice

508
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,560
was not going to do that in a hurry.

509
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,800
Oh, come on.

510
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,800
It's sounds like Catherine
didn't have it coming.

511
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,200
You poisoned Catherine?

512
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,840
Catherine poisoned Catherine

513
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,880
when she slithered into our family

514
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
and brainwashed our father.

515
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,560
And replaced us with that vapid

516
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,480
human-run-on-sentence of a daughter.

517
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,400
Catherine brought this on herself,

518
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:47,120
and I was more than happy
to watch Daddy go down with her.

519
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,520
That's what I thought.

520
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,880
We need to go.

521
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,000
One way or another dear sister,
you'll come to see my way.

522
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,160
Hang on, Mom.

523
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,600
They'll be here, pump your stomach,

524
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,880
and we'll find an antidote.
You just need to hang on, okay.

525
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,120
I always wanted...

526
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:46,760
To see you work at your clinic

527
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,920
How did you know about the clinic?

528
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,200
I've always known.

529
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,400
How come you never said anything?

530
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,960
The fastest way for you
to stop doing something...

531
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,440
was for me to approve of it.

532
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,520
Oh, my god.

533
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,640
Do you know how many wardrobe
changes

534
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,440
I did in that elevator
thinking that I was fooling you?

535
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,240
Cameras in the elevator.

536
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,480
Mom?

537
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
Mom.

538
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,920
Yeah.

539
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,280
- Mary...
- Yeah.

540
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,440
You're the one thing I did right.

541
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,960
Nothing makes me prouder
the way we raised you.

542
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,880
Mom.

543
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,360
No, no, no. Mom, mom, mom.

544
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,680
Stay with me.

545
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,880
Wake up!

546
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,840
Mom, please.

547
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Mom!

548
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,480
What is this?

549
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,080
- Kate?
- Who is this?

550
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,040
What? It's, it's me, Kate.

551
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,680
What did you get me
for my sixth birthday?

552
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,800
- What?
- What was it?

553
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,320
It was a bike.
It was too big for you.

554
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,320
You wrecked it the same day.
What is going on?

555
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,480
Alice and Mouse were at the gala.

556
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,480
Get out of the car commander.

557
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,880
- Dad?
- I'll call you right back.

558
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,960
What's going on, Commissioner?

559
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,520
Hands in the air, Kane.

560
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,520
Commissioner.

561
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,200
Jacob Kane, you're under arrest.

562
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,720
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

563
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,200
I've never seen that before
in my life.

564
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,520
What the hell is happening?
Get your hands off of me.

565
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,040
<i>Gotham is in shock tonight
over the death</i>

566
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,440
of Hamilton Dynamics
CEO Catherine Hamilton-Kane,

567
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,640
allegedly at the hands of her husband

568
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,160
and head of Crows Security,
Jacob Kane.

569
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,200
Her death occurred
just after some stunning

570
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,800
and very public admissions
by Hamilton-Kane

571
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,080
while accepting an award
Gotham's Humanitarian Gala.

572
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Mary.

573
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,840
Mary.

574
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,360
Do you know how many horrible
people that are saved?

575
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,760
Drug user.

576
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,640
Thugs with face tattoos.

577
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,080
Pulled a windshield out of a guy

578
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,560
who stole the car that he totaled,

579
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,120
and he walked out of my clinic
the next day

580
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,600
like nothing had happened.

581
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,200
But I...

582
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,880
I couldn't save her.

583
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,640
- I'm so sorry, Mary.
- You know, how she died?

584
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,920
Exactly the way
that Alice planned it.

585
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,920
Slowly...

586
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,680
and in pain.

587
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,280
And the only way for her
to save herself

588
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,600
was for me to die,

589
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,560
and she sure as hell
wasn't about to let that happen

590
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,440
because she is not
the horrible person

591
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,240
that you and Alice claim that she is.

592
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
You...

593
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,440
You are literally the last person

594
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,440
who can bring me comfort right now.

595
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,640
I'm gonna ask you again, Kate.
Is Alice worth it?

596
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,520
- No.
- Finally.

597
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,720
Too bad it's too late.

598
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,160
Agent Sophie Moore.

599
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,040
Yeah, it's been a late night
for us, too.

600
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,600
Just put me on with the Commissioner.

601
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,960
He's got the wrong guy.

602
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,160
Because I've got a dart hole
in my neck to prove it.

603
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,440
Please have him call me.

604
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,760
This is insane.

605
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,160
How can they think
he actually did this?

606
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,320
People believe what they're told.
It's human nature.

607
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,520
Then people are idiots.

608
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,120
- I should call Mary.
- I want kids.

609
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,240
What?

610
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,200
And dog, and family traditions
that we bitch about

611
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,360
but do anyways.

612
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,880
Okay.

613
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,200
I don't want to move past this today

614
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,600
and then have it come up
again in two years

615
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,960
and realize I'm wasting my life

616
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,800
fighting for something
I can't actually have.

617
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,280
I don't want that either.

618
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Do you love me?

619
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
Yes.

620
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,280
Are you in love with me?

621
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,280
Because if you love me
you'll be real with me right now.

622
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,480
I don't know.

623
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,240
Then let's not make this
any harder than it is.

624
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,800
I think you need to figure
yourself out.

625
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,640
And when you do and if you see
the same future, I do.

626
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,960
I'll still be here,

627
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,240
and maybe I won't.

628
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,960
<i>We all make choices, Bruce.
I choose hope.</i>

629
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,400
<i>And I chose to believe Beth
was still alive.</i>

630
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,240
<i>I chose to save my sister
from the monster she's become.</i>

631
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,880
<i>But by making that choice,</i>

632
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,280
<i>I lost my entire family
for the second time.</i>

633
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,120
<i>And now the only thing
I'm left with this awful truth</i>

634
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,320
<i>that Alice was right.</i>

635
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,960
<i>Beth is gone.</i>

636
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,160
My lawyer could only get us
five minutes.

637
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,480
I hate her so much, Dad.

638
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
When I get out of here,

639
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,880
I'm gonna put her down
once and for all.

640
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,800
And I won't stop you.

641
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,080
For so many years

642
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,920
{\an5}I've traveled across worlds...

643
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,480
{\an5}Across a multiverse to do one thing

644
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,320
to kill you.

645
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,920
And now over here...

646
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,960
You saved my life.

647
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,320
<i>Submit and begin your life anew.</i>

648
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,480
Show me.

649
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,800
<i>The knowledge is with in you.</i>
