1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:02,440
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,960
Dazzle me.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,600
A perfect match
for Dean Deveraux.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,440
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Deveraux?

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,280
Catherine Hamilton
and some investigators found

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,360
skull fragments of a little girl.
It's Beth.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,400
You never would have moved on

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,680
if you didn't think
that Beth were dead.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,600
I paid the DNA analyst
to write the report.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,360
Get away from me.
Just get away from me.

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,960
If I wanted to kill you

12
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,360
I wouldn't have to wait for you
to be wearing the suit.

13
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,640
<i>Your concern for me
is so touching, dear sister.</i>

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,160
So Kate is Batwoman.

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,120
- Is this you?
- It wasn't me.

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,040
- Tyler, this is Kate.
- You're married.

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,280
<i>I don't know how you did it,
Bruce.</i>

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,040
<i>You spent night after night
in these same shadows</i>

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,720
<i>prowling, hunting, hiding...</i>

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,280
<i>And you did it in secret,
all alone.</i>

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,160
Everyone all right?

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,400
Bravo team,
check on Alessandro's.

23
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,920
- I'll circle around back.
- You heard her. Move out.

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,720
<i>Did it ever get to you, Bruce?
The loneliness?</i>

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,880
<i>Did you ever let yourself
trust anyone?</i>

26
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,280
- Kate.
<i>- How'd that work out for you?</i>

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,840
Sorry to disappoint.

28
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,080
Your dad ordered the Crows
to stop you at any cost.

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,320
He needs to know
you're his daughter.

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,440
You have the wrong girl.

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,680
Kate, I'm serious.
You're in danger.

32
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,720
And if you won't tell him, I will.

33
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,800
- Do you trust me?
- What?

34
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
I'll find you.

35
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Shooter escaped.

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,040
Was that Batwoman?

37
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,240
She say anything to you?

38
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,000
No. She just took off.

39
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,320
Tuxedo One here.

40
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,080
I was right.

41
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,200
The Rifle's made his way
to Gotham.

42
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,480
<i>The third time is not the charm</i>

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,160
<i>for Gotham's
prolific shadow shooter.</i>

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,200
<i>After killing two people this week</i>

45
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,320
<i>sources say Batwoman thwarted</i>

46
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
<i>his attack at Alessandro's
last night</i>

47
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,240
<i>which means I'm not the only one</i>

48
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,000
<i>who thinks they have
the best osso buco in the city.</i>

49
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,440
{\an5}<i>Without this city's hero,
our doors would be shuttered.</i>

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,840
{\an5}<i>Batwoman, if you see this</i>

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,560
{\an5}<i>you're welcome for a free meal
at Alessandro's anytime.</i>

52
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,880
{\an5}<i>Anytime!</i>

53
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Hey.

54
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,080
Just read this news blurb
your dad filed for divorce.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,120
Yep.

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,520
Are you okay?

57
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,560
He married a woman who preyed on
his grief and convinced him that

58
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,960
I was crazy for thinking
Beth was still alive.

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,040
{\an5}Can't say I'm losing any sleep over it.

60
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,560
{\an5}If it means anything,
I didn't sleep last night either.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,400
{\an5}Why, Luke? What was on your mind?
Oh, thanks for asking.

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,520
I was up analyzing
the list of everyone

63
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,040
who was at Alessandro's
for dinner.

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,600
{\an5}Hey, cool. Way to take
the initiative on that.

65
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,720
Find anything? I did, in fact.
Last two victims of the sniper

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,920
{\an5}both worked for your future
ex-stepmother's companies.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,680
{\an5}Now, one of Alessandro's
dinner guests

68
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,880
Derek Holcomb,
works for Pyra Electric.

69
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,320
They make all of
Hamilton Dynamics' conductors,

70
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,480
{\an5}which, following the pattern...

71
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,880
{\an5}Makes him the target.

72
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,840
I need to find him.

73
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,480
{\an5}I agree, but I haven't quite
found a home address.

74
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Then find it.

75
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,880
{\an5}Urgency's good.
You're being very urgent, though.

76
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,800
{\an5}- Sophie knows who I am.
- Right.

77
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,400
- Thought Sophie was cool.
- You're not getting it.

78
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,040
{\an5}She's threatening to tell my dad.

79
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,200
{\an5}He's gonna freak out
and shut us down.

80
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,680
{\an5}Means no more protecting people.

81
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,960
{\an5}No, more helping the city.

82
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,720
No, more Batwoman.

83
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Can you trust her?

84
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,600
{\an5}I used to trust her.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,040
{\an5}With everything.

86
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,960
{\an5}Then just be real with her.

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,960
{\an5}And for the sake of the city

88
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,440
{\an5}convince the hell out of her
not to tell your dad who you are.

89
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

90
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Have you seen him?

91
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,880
{\an5}Kane? Heard he went upstate. Why?

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,600
I need to talk to him
about something.

93
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,640
{\an5}Oh, I'm sure he brought his phone.

94
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,320
{\an5}Kind of an in-person thing.

95
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,400
{\an5}Is it kind of a husband thing?
Because now I'm super curious.

96
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,280
I promise you'll be
the second person to know.

97
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,080
I thought you said,
Batwoman took off

98
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,200
before you could talk to her.

99
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,040
{\an5}She did. Why?

100
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you working with her?

101
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,920
{\an5}Am I working with her?

102
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,920
Look how close you two are.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,640
I commanded she surrender.

104
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,880
You're acting like
we exchanged brownie recipes.

105
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,000
Sophie,

106
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,040
do you know who she is?

107
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,640
No.

108
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,040
Tyler, I don't.

109
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,440
Okay.

110
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,600
{\an5}So, now, Dad's not even showing up
to the divorce proceedings?

111
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,520
The lawyers said he's upstate.

112
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,480
{\an5}He bailed. Kate bailed.

113
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,120
If I knew it was
attendance optional

114
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,640
{\an5}I would've literally been
anywhere else.

115
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,840
Are we gonna talk about this

116
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,280
or just act like everything
isn't about to change?

117
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,160
Not everything has to change.

118
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,680
We still have the penthouse.
You can still go to school...

119
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,560
I'm losing my sister.

120
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,440
Kate and I have finally started
to have a connection

121
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,640
after five years,
and now she hates me.

122
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,920
Because of you.

123
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,320
When you are a mother,

124
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,120
you'll understand
why I did what I did.

125
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,360
What am I supposed to do
until then?

126
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,800
You're the only family
I have left,

127
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,760
and I don't even want to be
in this car with you right now.

128
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,800
Mary, I have enough
going on right now

129
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,280
without another guilt trip.

130
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,520
Your text doesn't make sense.

131
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,040
A coil accelerator
doesn't just go missing.

132
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
It's under
level five security protocol.

133
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,760
Then get me Dean Deveraux.

134
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,600
He created the gun. He'll know
exactly what's going on.

135
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,320
Oh, my god.

136
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,960
Killed by whom?

137
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,760
<i>Derek Holcomb
just swiped his badge</i>

138
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,280
<i>at the Hamilton Dynamics exit
two minutes ago.</i>

139
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,880
<i>We need to get him
before the shooter does.</i>

140
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,760
I see Derek.

141
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,600
Heads up. Second heat signature
30 feet to the west.

142
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,000
I see him too.

143
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,920
- Batcave to Batwoman, there's...
<i>- Let me guess.</i>

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,280
A third heat signature?

145
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,240
- Not another step, Batwoman.
- I'll be bringing him in.

146
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,920
<i>Good news,
Derek Holcomb got away.</i>

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,040
<i>Bad news, so did the shooter.</i>

148
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,520
Kate Kane.

149
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,360
What? I'd recognize
that Hammer Strike anywhere.

150
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,640
After all, I taught it to you.

151
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,040
Julia Pennyworth.

152
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Figured Alfred would've
taught you better manners.

153
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,320
Let's leave my father
out of this.

154
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,560
Who is that assassin?

155
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,840
What the hell are you doing
in my city?

156
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,720
Good job, sweet Mouse.

157
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,080
And that is how you kill someone
the first time.

158
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,800
I killed two men for you.

159
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,000
Of the...

160
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,680
Three I requested.

161
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,000
If I walked around failing
at a third of everything I did,

162
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,880
I'd still be locked in a cell
on a diet of my own fingernails.

163
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,560
Mouse!

164
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Can you tell our friend here

165
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,400
why we hired him
to kill those scientists?

166
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,960
Because they were
the only people on the planet

167
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,880
who knew how to make that gun.

168
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,120
Which makes this one of a kind.

169
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,000
See, I did your boss a favor.
Now, no one can recreate it.

170
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,560
Time to hand over
what she promised me in return.

171
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,400
Easy, blondie.

172
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,440
Where is it?

173
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,080
She's not giving you anything
until she finds out that works.

174
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
Send her a selfie.

175
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,680
And give me a call
when you have what I'm owed.

176
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,680
<i>So, who does he work for?</i>

177
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,680
The Rifle? Anyone and everyone.

178
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,080
That's what makes him slippery.

179
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,160
My agency assigned me to him
eight months ago?

180
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,520
You kept Dino.

181
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,320
Bruce would be so happy.

182
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,800
So, how'd the Rifle end up here?

183
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,720
I lost sight of him in Jakarta,
picked up a scent in Metropolis,

184
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,120
and then I followed a tip
that he got a job in Gotham.

185
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,800
Whenever the Rifle shows up,

186
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,080
he leaves death and destruction
in his wake.

187
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
I know the type.

188
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
Good for you.

189
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,880
Following in
your cousin's footsteps.

190
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,440
Bruce is apparently better
at keeping his secret than I am.

191
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,760
To be fair,
I did teach you that move.

192
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,720
And a few others, if I recall.

193
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Holy crap!

194
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,720
- Don't worry. She's...
- Julia?

195
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,840
Luke Fox.

196
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
- What are you doing here?
- Business.

197
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,960
Glimpses of pleasure.

198
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
How you doing, love?

199
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,440
You know,
holding down the fort.

200
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,800
Of course you are.
A chip off the old block.

201
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,600
I was just gonna suggest
to Kate that we all team up

202
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,240
and nab this sniping bastard.

203
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,960
- What do you say?
- Not happening.

204
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,560
Unless you forgot
the last time we "teamed up."

205
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm missing something.

206
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,120
Kate's still sore at me
for a little white lie

207
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,600
I told in the British Isles.

208
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
When I first met Julia,

209
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,200
she was pretending to be
a Krav Maga teacher.

210
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,400
She'd just been naughtily
expelled from military school,

211
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
sent off to train with strangers
around the world,

212
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,440
and Bruce asked me to check up
on his favorite cousin

213
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,640
without making it seem
like I was babysitting.

214
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,680
So you lied and pretended
that you had a thing for me.

215
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,960
Love, the only thing I lied about
was why I was there.

216
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,480
Oh, so you two "know each other"
know each other.

217
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,600
Well, I was only trying
to help you move on from...

218
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,720
What was her name?

219
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,200
- Sophie something.
- Yeah, that didn't work.

220
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,680
I'm sorry. Who asked you?

221
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,760
- Oh, we still not over her, then?
- She's married.

222
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,800
- To a man.
- We're done talking about this.

223
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,560
She is hell-bent on telling
my dad that I'm Batwoman,

224
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,120
and I need to convince her
not to.

225
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,240
How can I help?

226
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,840
Find the Rifle guy.

227
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,000
And stay the hell out
of my business.

228
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,120
"I hereby deny the allegation
of homosexual conduct.

229
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,080
Signing the above denial
will drop all disciplinary action

230
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,040
and permit the cadet
in question to reengage

231
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,800
with all academic activity."

232
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,040
- Damn it.
- It's gonna be okay.

233
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,280
For you.

234
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,840
Your dad doesn't dry-heave
when he sees a rainbow flag.

235
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,080
My mom calls gays
degenerate sinners.

236
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,160
We should tell the truth.

237
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,040
They'll kick us out.

238
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,840
We'll never make it
into the army.

239
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,120
If we lie, why are we even here?

240
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,880
Besides, they're not gonna kick
out the academy's top two cadets

241
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,320
a week before graduation.

242
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,320
- What if you're wrong?
- Sophie...

243
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,880
Look at everything we've done
over the past four years.

244
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,160
First off, we're women
at Point Rock.

245
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,120
Sophie freaking Moore broke
Shawn Izadi's obstacle record

246
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,400
by one second.

247
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,320
You did make the sharpshooter
competition your bitch.

248
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,760
And we did it all together.

249
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,440
And we'll get through this
together...

250
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,920
as long as we stay united.

251
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,000
You're right.

252
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,840
They're not gonna expel
Sophie freaking Moore.

253
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Let's do it.
Let's tell them the truth.

254
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,720
We're telling them the truth.

255
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,240
I need to run a quick errand.

256
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,920
- Is it her?
- Who?

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
- Batwoman.
- No.

258
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,800
- And keep your voice down.
- So, it is her?

259
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,800
Look, I'll tell you everything
when I get back.

260
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,680
- I promise.
- Soph.

261
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,280
Hey. Thanks for meeting with me.

262
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,200
Interesting choice.

263
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,600
Wine. Candlelight.
Your favorite kicks.

264
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
If I didn't know better,

265
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,040
I'd think
you're about to propose.

266
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,920
Very funny.

267
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,600
So, why am I here, Kate?

268
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,640
Before I say anything,
I need to know I can trust you.

269
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,600
I can't promise you something
when I don't know what it is.

270
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,000
Yeah. I...

271
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,640
I need you to.

272
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,920
Okay. You can trust me.

273
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
So I should start by saying

274
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,800
I'm the last person
I ever imagined

275
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,160
would be in this position.

276
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,800
Pardon the interruption, ladies.

277
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,480
Unfortunately,
sneakers are not allowed

278
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,920
in the dining area.

279
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,160
I'm surprised
that you could see them

280
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,360
considering they're hiding
underneath our table.

281
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,080
- Dress codes are dress codes.
- Right.

282
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,160
That guy right there
is wearing sneakers.

283
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,720
Maybe you would enjoy instead
our lounge outside?

284
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,960
Thank you,
but we're really good here.

285
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,320
Sophie, my love,
what would you like to eat?

286
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,840
Kate.

287
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,920
Signora...

288
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,840
Let's avoid a scene.

289
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,920
Then admit that the only thing
offensive about my shoes is me.

290
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,080
Kate, chill.

291
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,320
Please tell me you get
what's happening right now.

292
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:23,720
Miss, I need to ask you to leave.

293
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,720
Then I need to call
my stepsister. Mary Hamilton?

294
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,280
Do you know her?
Because she knows you

295
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,120
and 3.5 million other people.

296
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,640
Oh, yeah, one snap from her
and she will shut this place down

297
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
faster than you can say,

298
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,240
"Gay people
make me feel uncomfortable."

299
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,040
- Enjoy your meal.
- Yeah.

300
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,680
Thanks, but we're not hungry
anymore.

301
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,320
- Was that necessary?
- Standing up for myself? Yeah.

302
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
That's what it looks like
when it comes out naturally.

303
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,960
Don't even go there, Kate.

304
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,760
I have no intention
of going there.

305
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,480
"There" is some sad
and lonely closet

306
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,000
that I want nothing to do with.

307
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,880
What went down at Point Rock
was the worst day of my life.

308
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,280
Worse than having
the love of your life

309
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,400
- lie straight to your face?
- I wasn't planning to lie to you.

310
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,000
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

311
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,600
I was going to do everything
we talked about.

312
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,600
Tell the truth, throw the letter
in their face, stand my ground.

313
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,680
- So, what happened?
- I got a second opinion.

314
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
So...

315
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,360
This day sucks.

316
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,200
Mr. Kane. Hi.

317
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
Your mom coming for the hearing?

318
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,400
I asked them not to call her.
She has no idea.

319
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,160
I love your daughter, sir.

320
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,520
Kate and I are going
to stick together on this.

321
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,600
They can't kick out
their top two cadets.

322
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,520
Well, Moore, you should do

323
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,160
whatever you think
you need to do.

324
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
But?

325
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,600
But if you think you're going
to walk out of there

326
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,360
without signing
that letter of denial

327
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,200
and still graduate,

328
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,480
you are in
for a major disappointment.

329
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,760
Did you say that to Kate?

330
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,280
Kate is fearless,
passionate, and reckless.

331
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,880
She is going to walk
into that hearing

332
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,040
and burn the house down.

333
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,920
Nothing I say
can convince her otherwise.

334
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,200
That's what I love about her.

335
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,560
But this will be her last day
at Point Rock.

336
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,400
What about the bad press?

337
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,560
The school is built on history,
tradition, and code.

338
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,960
They'll point to the rules,
say you broke them,

339
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,400
and forget you ever existed.

340
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,480
If I don't tell the truth,
it will destroy our relationship.

341
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,320
I can't make this decision
for you.

342
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,400
And I'm sorry
that you have to make it at all.

343
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,720
You looked me straight in the eye
and told me you didn't love me.

344
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,840
I thought it would be
cleaner than...

345
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,000
Than telling me
that my dad convinced you to lie?

346
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,080
He didn't tell me to lie.

347
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
He opened my eyes to reality.

348
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
I was going to get expelled.

349
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,640
And thanks to him,
I ended up serving. I graduated.

350
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,800
I... I made money for my family.

351
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,600
I got handpicked by your dad
to help lead the Crows.

352
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,720
You credit your entire career
to my dad.

353
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,240
I credit him for stopping me

354
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,280
from losing everything
I worked for.

355
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,000
And instead, you just lost me.

356
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,160
How long?

357
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,040
The details don't matter.

358
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,280
I'm here thinking you have
a bead on Batwoman's identity,

359
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,080
and you sit me down
and tell me that dating a chick

360
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,560
almost got you expelled
from military academy.

361
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,160
I'm owed some details, Soph.

362
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
We met sophomore year.

363
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,560
Our dorm rooms
were in the same building.

364
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,880
So, three years?

365
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,400
- Give or take.
- Give or take.

366
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,440
Just to be clear,

367
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,960
three years is longer
than any relationship

368
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,120
I've had outside of you.

369
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,040
I'm not saying
it's insignificant.

370
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,000
Then why didn't you tell me?

371
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,680
You've met my mom.

372
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,560
Yeah. Does she know?

373
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Of course not.

374
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,720
But that's what I'm saying.

375
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,880
I didn't tell anyone.
I just wanted it to go away.

376
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Has it?

377
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,880
Tyler, you are my husband.
I love you.

378
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,560
Has your thing with Kate
gone away?

379
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,000
Got it, Soph.

380
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,960
So the guy just bursts through
the door of the noodle house,

381
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,880
yelling,
"Pennyworth, you're mine!"

382
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,440
So that's how Kate found out
who you really were.

383
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,040
Well, yeah. Once I knocked
the guy on his ass,

384
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,080
I couldn't really go back
to my egg drop soup

385
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,400
without explaining.

386
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,920
Kate's bags were packed, and she
was gone by the end of the day.

387
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,560
Story time.
You must have a 20 on the Rifle.

388
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,800
Sad news, actually.
We found Derek Holcomb.

389
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,520
Despite dodging death twice,

390
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,520
the poor bloke was found
knifed to death in an alley.

391
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,080
Not exactly the Rifle's MO.
So, the trail's gone cold?

392
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
For now.

393
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,760
- So, how'd Sophie take it?
- She didn't.

394
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,160
I didn't tell her.

395
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,840
You're a few sandwiches
short of a picnic, love.

396
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,640
She's going to tell your dad.

397
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,000
She would anyway.

398
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,480
There's no way Sophie will ever
be anything but loyal to him.

399
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,080
So, how do we keep him
from shutting us down?

400
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,600
- We move to plan C.
- Which is?

401
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,480
A little bit crazy.

402
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,560
Oh, my god,
you have a safe room?

403
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,160
- Mary.
- How did you get past security?

404
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,760
Karl at the front desk loves
double-whipped Frappuccinos.

405
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,120
- Good. He'll be making them soon.
- Anyway...

406
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,680
I thought we could confab about
the implosion of our family.

407
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,440
- You're new.
- This is Julia.

408
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,760
Julia's my assistant.

409
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,560
You have two assistants
who work past midnight

410
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,960
for a real estate company
without any real estate.

411
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,800
Now, is not really a good time.

412
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,760
Yeah, I got that.

413
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,720
Look, I know everything at home
sucks right now.

414
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,000
I will call you tomorrow.

415
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,520
Is our parents' divorce
even a blip on your radar?

416
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Because it sort of feels like

417
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,600
I'm the only one trying
to hold our family together,

418
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,240
and I'm starting to wonder
if there's really any point.

419
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,880
Welcome back.

420
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,280
I know I'm the last person
you want to see right now.

421
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,040
Whatever it is, we should
work it out with lawyers present.

422
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,520
No, lawyers, Jacob.
This is bigger than that.

423
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,520
I think I know who the sniper
is targeting.

424
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,000
Hamilton Dynamics had been
working on a coil accelerator

425
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,360
that could penetrate
the Kevlar on Batman's suit.

426
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,800
When he disappeared,
we put the project on hold.

427
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,600
Then Batwoman showed up.
We had it reinstated.

428
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,880
And the only three engineers

429
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,840
intimately connected
to the project

430
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,960
have already been killed.

431
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,240
Including the designer,
whose last check-in

432
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,480
was at one of
Hamilton's top secret labs.

433
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,320
When we find the gun,
I'll call you.

434
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,160
A micro spectrometer can track

435
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,960
the gun's
electromagnetic radiation.

436
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,120
We don't have the technology
to do that here.

437
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,400
Actually,
we can do that now, sir.

438
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,080
Didn't mean to eavesdrop,

439
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,400
but ARGUS lent us
micro spectrometers

440
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,760
for testing last month.

441
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,440
You know, I don't recall
this being an open forum.

442
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,920
Permission for a moment alone,
sir?

443
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,200
It's urgent.

444
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,160
Thank you, Jacob.

445
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,240
If there's a coil accelerator

446
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,680
out there on the streets
of Gotham, you need to find it.

447
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,160
We will. But I have
other pressing matters

448
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,880
apart from cleaning up
another mess created by my wife.

449
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,000
- The gun could kill Batwoman.
- That's not really my problem.

450
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,120
Actually, it is, sir.

451
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,720
I said I'll deal with it
another time.

452
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,960
Sir, she's your daughter.

453
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,040
Kate is Batwoman.

454
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,840
And if there's someone out there

455
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,520
who wants to kill her
with this gun,

456
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,240
we need to stop him.

457
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,840
As you requested.

458
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,480
Then I have what she wanted.

459
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,880
Send Batwoman my love.

460
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,000
Alpha team, report.

461
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,000
<i>- First floor's clear.
- Roof's clear.</i>

462
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,280
<i>Are we sure about this place?</i>

463
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,280
The radioactive signature
on the gun is off the charts.

464
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,840
Whoever has it is close by.

465
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,920
<i>You signed it.</i>

466
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,600
I told them
what they wanted to hear.

467
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,720
You lied.

468
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,640
I need this school, okay.
I want to be here.

469
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,280
But they don't want you.

470
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,040
Unfortunately,
I don't have the luxury

471
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,360
of being offended by that.

472
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,640
And maybe it's best
if you just kept your distance

473
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
from now on.

474
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,800
Hey.

475
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,800
I know you love me.

476
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,000
Tell me that I'm wrong,
and I'll walk away

477
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,960
and let you make
the biggest mistake of your life.

478
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,760
You're wrong, Kate.

479
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
I have to go.

480
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,760
That's Kate's
sharpshooter competition medal.

481
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,040
Cadet Kane
doesn't go here anymore.

482
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,800
Do you even know
how she won that?

483
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,520
Guess it doesn't really matter,
does it?

484
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,440
She didn't even try.

485
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
In fact...

486
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,160
She was so hungover
from tequila shots

487
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,840
the night before it was insane
anyone even handed her a gun.

488
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,840
And she still managed
to be the best.

489
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,440
Out of 200 other cadets, she hit
the target dead-on every time.

490
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,880
Because Kate Kane doesn't waver.

491
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,160
She did more for this school
than anyone who's ever gone here.

492
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,000
So you can scrub her name
from every plaque

493
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,840
and banner and roster,

494
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,200
but you will never erase her

495
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,200
or the effect she's had
on the people here.

496
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,320
<i>Base to Moore. What's your 20?</i>

497
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,360
No, sign of him, sir.

498
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,600
- I'll check back in five.
- Ten-four.

499
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,840
Anything?

500
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,760
Not yet.

501
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,680
What did Sophie want?

502
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
It's complicated.

503
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,560
Is it me, or does everything
lately seem complicated?

504
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,400
But the thing about complicated

505
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,440
is we handle it better
than anyone I know.

506
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,640
We met under the most complicated
circumstances imaginable.

507
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,320
You were so lost, Jacob.

508
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,320
So full of guilt and anger
and hopelessness.

509
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,160
All I wanted to do was give you
a place to put it all.

510
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,520
So we channeled it here.

511
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,160
If we can turn the pain
into power,

512
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,560
we can do anything, Jacob.

513
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,760
As long as we do it together.

514
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,280
What are you doing here?

515
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,760
You need to get out
of this building.

516
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,040
- Seriously, you need to leave now.
- Sophie.

517
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,680
Before you say anything,
I want you to know

518
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,600
if I could do it all over again,

519
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,760
I would've jumped
on the back of your bike

520
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,240
and left Point Rock in my dust.

521
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,800
Did you tell Jacob Kane?

522
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,960
Yes.

523
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,440
But I didn't tell him
because I'm loyal to the Crows.

524
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,320
I told him because you're going
to get yourself killed,

525
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
if not by us,
then by one of your enemies,

526
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,000
and if that ever happened...

527
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,720
- Kate, I can't lose you.
- Sophie?

528
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,640
What the hell is going on?

529
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,560
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

530
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,960
Touching story.

531
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,960
Couldn't help myself.

532
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,680
How are you here, Kate?

533
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,880
<i>There was
an electromagnetic surge</i>

534
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,160
<i>- on the second floor.</i>
- All units, converge.

535
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,560
- What the hell was that?
- A coil accelerator.

536
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,160
No, sign of the assassin, sir.
But we got one better. Batwoman.

537
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,040
Bring her to me.

538
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,640
I thought her suit
was bulletproof.

539
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,960
That's what I was trying
to tell you. Or her. Whatever.

540
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,080
Whoever shot her
used a gun that could kill her.

541
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,520
- The hell are you doing?
- Getting her back.

542
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,120
<i>- Luke, come in. Luke.</i>
- I've been trying to reach you.

543
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,800
I heard the explosion over comms
and got worried

544
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,520
- when you didn't report in.
<i>- The Crows have Julia.</i>

545
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,200
Activate the suit's GPS.

546
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,920
<i>Please tell me
this has nothing to do</i>

547
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,080
with the massive amounts
of electromagnetic radiation

548
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,640
- spewing from that area.
- Just activate the GPS.

549
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,440
Okay, they're on Fifth and Grant
in the Bowery.

550
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,040
They're headed toward
the 22nd Street tunnel.

551
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,120
Once they're through,
they're at Crows headquarters,

552
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
and Julia's screwed.
You gotta do something right now.

553
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,000
Get your ass on the ground!

554
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,120
Get on the ground!

555
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,280
Hey! Oh, thank god.

556
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,080
What the hell was that?

557
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,200
You were hit by a gun
that should've killed you.

558
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,320
I don't know why it didn't.

559
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,600
The gun didn't work.

560
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,800
You said the projectile
would penetrate the suit.

561
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh, dear, how puzzling it all is.

562
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:47,840
And to think
you've personally killed everyone

563
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,960
capable of fixing it.

564
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,760
Oh, wait,
I had my little Mouse kill one.

565
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,920
Guess I'm one-third responsible.

566
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,840
Listen, you crazy bitch.

567
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,440
You didn't just play me.
You played her.

568
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,520
Safiyah's gonna be pissed from...

569
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,400
Don't you ever say her name
in front of me!

570
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,200
She's a smart woman.

571
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,480
She'll figure it out.

572
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,320
She's as smart
as she is unforgiving.

573
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,840
Whatever reason you betrayed her
better be worth it.

574
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,240
As you requested.

575
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,560
See, dear sister?

576
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,080
There isn't anything
I wouldn't do to protect you.

577
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Careful.

578
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,640
I'm livid the Rifle got away.

579
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,000
The broken ribs from our little
ruse aren't helping either.

580
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,080
Consider us even.

581
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,280
So I thought about it,
and it makes sense.

582
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,040
The not-trusting-people thing.

583
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,360
Clear as day, in fact.

584
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,840
Don't tell me
you've figured me out.

585
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,840
I was gonna say I'm sorry.

586
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,080
I should've been straight
about who I was when we met,

587
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,800
especially once feelings
got involved.

588
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,360
Instead, I burned you.

589
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,160
And now your girl Sophie's
doing the same.

590
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,400
Trust be damned.

591
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,800
She's not my girl.

592
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,600
Whoever she is, it's a shame.

593
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,360
Because she loves you.

594
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,840
Not to crash the party,

595
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,680
but the knife police recovered
from Derek Holcomb's chest,

596
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,760
it was a butterfly knife.

597
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,440
You think it's Alice's?

598
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,640
Why would she want him dead?

599
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,480
She hired the Rifle
to kill anyone

600
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,680
who was connected to the gun
and then tried to kill me with it.

601
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,560
It sounds like
delicious family drama.

602
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,160
And unfortunately, I won't get
to see how the play ends.

603
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,520
You're leaving?
There's a sniper on the loose

604
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
who is trying to kill me.

605
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,760
Relax, love.
My agency's just got word

606
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,560
he's headed back to an island
off the Mediterranean

607
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,760
with that gun in tow.

608
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,440
Which means I'm on
a one-way flight to Santorini.

609
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,280
Just don't get yourself killed.

610
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,600
I'm touched you care.

611
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,480
See you again soon, Kate.

612
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,280
Luke, always a pleasure.

613
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,720
You know, apart from my father
and Lucius, of course,

614
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,080
Bruce Wayne never trusted a soul.

615
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,120
Now, I'm not judging his choices,
I wasn't in his shoes, but...

616
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,840
When you don't trust anyone,

617
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,240
it means that you can disappear
for four years

618
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,920
without a single person
on the planet

619
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,400
having any idea where you are.

620
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,120
Now, call me sentimental,

621
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,240
but I don't think
that's a good thing.

622
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,920
Nice digs.

623
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,680
Gotham Pride Real Estate's
first acquisition.

624
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,880
Catchy name.

625
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,320
So I heard someone took out
a Crows van

626
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,040
with a 50-meter precision shot.

627
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,440
I got the impression
that Batwoman means a lot to you.

628
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,760
And I didn't want her to end up
in the wrong hands.

629
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,280
Brought you something
to celebrate.

630
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,240
And I cleared things up
with your dad,

631
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,160
told him I was wrong
about the Batwoman thing...

632
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,480
and how I assumed
you weren't real with me

633
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,600
because of what went down
at Point Rock.

634
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,880
Me in a red wig?
Not happening.

635
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,760
Then why did you invite me
to dinner?

636
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
I...

637
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,680
I needed to clear things up
with you.

638
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,520
As hard as I've tried
to get over you,

639
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
I can't.

640
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,480
And it's, it's not fair to you...

641
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,520
And based on
what I heard you tell Batwoman,

642
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,880
it's definitely not fair
to Tyler.

643
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,440
- Kate.
- Actually, I...

644
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,480
I think you were right
six years ago.

645
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,240
And maybe it's best
if I keep my distance

646
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,360
from now on.

647
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,400
If that's
what you think will work.

648
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,560
I think it has to.

649
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,880
Good luck with the place.

650
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,520
See you, Sophie.

651
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,520
<i>Batman was praised and revered.</i>

652
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,680
<i>But Bruce Wayne?
Not so much.</i>

653
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,960
<i>No, one knew the man
beneath the cowl.</i>

654
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,360
<i>You didn't let them in, Bruce,
for good reason.</i>

655
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,320
<i>Because even the people we love</i>

656
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,000
<i>are still people
at the end of the day.</i>

657
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,240
You want the truth?

658
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,800
The truth is anything I felt
for Kate Kane went away

659
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,720
the day I chose
my future over her.

660
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,080
You're the only one I love,
Tyler.

661
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,640
<i>They act out of fear,
pride, hope, pain.</i>

662
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,240
<i>And sometimes they let us down.</i>

663
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,680
<i>But you know better than I do</i>

664
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,720
<i>that no one can be
a lone wolf forever.</i>

665
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,880
Need a hand with that?

666
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,720
That is exactly why I called.

667
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,600
So, of all the dumps for sale
in Gotham, why this place?

668
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,800
The guy across the street
asked me to leave his restaurant.

669
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
I wonder how he'll like it

670
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,920
when I turn this joint
into a gay bar.

671
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,320
So, obviously,
I'm running point on design.

672
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,120
<i>I have to let people in,</i>

673
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,520
<i>even if it's just one person</i>

674
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,880
<i>and one small piece
of myself at a time.</i>

675
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,120
Hey, kid, just checking in.

676
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,240
My lead on Cartwright upstate
was a dead end.

677
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,400
Guy I found came up clean.

678
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,120
Waste of a couple days,
but worth a shot.

679
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,040
Anyway, I'll probably stay
up here another night,

680
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,760
then head back to Gotham
to figure out our next move.

681
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,000
Hope you're good.

682
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,440
Daddy, you are so handsome.

683
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,920
Catherine seems to think so.

684
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,440
I assumed you'd let
the snake slither back

685
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,960
into her husband's good graces.

686
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,640
Burrowed in so deep
I can still hear her rattle.

687
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,360
They'll never see it coming.

688
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,080
A red, hot poker will burn you
if you hold it too long,

689
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,920
and if you cut your finger
deeply with a knife,

690
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,800
