1
00:00:00,069 --> 00:00:01,868
Previously on "Batwoman"...

2
00:00:01,904 --> 00:00:05,250
How about we don't get expelled
a week before graduation?

3
00:00:05,251 --> 00:00:07,550
I need this school,
OK? I want to be here.

4
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:09,100
But they don't want you.

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,990
Maybe it's best if you just
kept your distance from now on.

6
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:13,825
I know you love me. Tell me that
I'm wrong, and I'll walk away

7
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:15,995
and let you make the
biggest mistake of your life.

8
00:00:15,997 --> 00:00:17,464
You're wrong, Kate.

9
00:00:18,366 --> 00:00:19,932
- Is this you?
- Wasn't me.

10
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:21,735
So what is she doing with herself?

11
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:25,838
So are you on this assignment
to keep tabs on me or on Kate?

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,144
- Dad?
- Catherine Hamilton's investigators found bones,

13
00:00:31,146 --> 00:00:33,646
skull fragments of a little girl.

14
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:35,314
It's Beth.

15
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:37,517
Hi, Daddy.

16
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:38,851
Put down the knife.

17
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:40,186
You gave up on me!

18
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:41,688
Beth, drop the damn knife!

19
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,356
Agh!

20
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:46,526
- Dad.
- Kate, it's her. It's Beth.

21
00:00:49,363 --> 00:00:51,030
I have a gift for you, too.

22
00:00:51,032 --> 00:00:53,299
Now that we are together again,

23
00:00:53,301 --> 00:00:56,302
I can help you become
anyone you want to be.

24
00:00:56,304 --> 00:00:58,204
Are we mad?

25
00:00:58,206 --> 00:00:59,739
I'm afraid so.

26
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:01,340
Ha ha ha!

27
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,950
Absolutely not.

28
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:06,546
Listen. The victim had
the courage to come forward

29
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:09,749
and face her attackers.

30
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:12,218
Well, I'm confident a jury
will make the right decision.

31
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,553
The question is are you?

32
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,610
Oh, my God.

33
00:01:39,948 --> 00:01:42,081
No, no, no!

34
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,889
Oh, God!

36
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,410
Beth was being held by a
madman with a medical license.

37
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:13,512
We don't have much to go on.

38
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:16,048
The deed to the house belonged
to Dr. August Cartwright.

39
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,650
I have teams trying to pick up a trace,

40
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:19,852
but it's like he just disappeared.

41
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:22,014
Apparently he's a better
magician than he was a doctor.

42
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:28,661
Beth was held in a cell by
a guy making human skin masks

43
00:02:28,663 --> 00:02:31,097
while I was at home playing club soccer.

44
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,232
We need to find him.

45
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:37,036
- We will.
- We didn't find her.

46
00:02:37,038 --> 00:02:40,339
How many times can I say I'm
sorry for not listening to you?

47
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,941
I don't know.

48
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:44,844
How many times will it
take to get Beth back?

49
00:02:49,684 --> 00:02:51,417
Sir, you're gonna want to see this.

50
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:53,419
Gotham is reeling over the death

51
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:54,887
of prosecutor Angus Stanton,

52
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,956
who was murdered horrifically tonight.

53
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,926
Stanton was seen by
many as a hero to Gotham,

54
00:02:59,928 --> 00:03:01,560
one who brought justice to the victims

55
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:03,963
of some of the city's
most notorious criminals

56
00:03:03,965 --> 00:03:07,099
such as Jack Napier,
otherwise known as The Joker.

57
00:03:07,101 --> 00:03:08,901
Channel 9 has the
security camera footage.

58
00:03:08,903 --> 00:03:11,270
Conviction rate, Stanton was known...

59
00:03:11,272 --> 00:03:14,307
What's he wearing?

60
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,609
It's an old-fashioned
executioner's hood.

61
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:21,414
- Ax is a nice touch.
- This is Dana DeWitt reporting live from Old Gotham.

62
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,249
Anybody want to tell
me why every news outlet

63
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:25,117
in Gotham had this
and we didn't even get

64
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:27,586
so much as a heads-up from the GCPD?

65
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:29,622
Technically, it's
outside district lines.

66
00:03:29,624 --> 00:03:31,958
And I believe it's because
they called someone else.

67
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,502
I am not about to stand
around and let Gotham cry out

68
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:46,672
to be saved by someone
who hides behind a mask.

69
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:49,842
The Bat is nothing more
than a symbol of false hope.

70
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:52,178
I want this so-called
Executioner cuffed

71
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,846
and stuffed in a cell in Blackgate.

72
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:55,614
If this city starts to think it can rely

73
00:03:55,616 --> 00:03:57,249
on a vigilante for justice,

74
00:03:57,251 --> 00:04:01,087
we might as well hand
it over to the crazies.

75
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:04,657
Sir... I know it's all hands
on deck with the Stanton case,

76
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,025
but I was hoping to get your permission

77
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:07,460
for another special assignment.

78
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:08,961
Who is it this time?

79
00:04:08,963 --> 00:04:11,163
Batwoman.

80
00:04:11,165 --> 00:04:13,332
Don't you want to know
who's behind the mask?

81
00:04:32,486 --> 00:04:36,889
Heh heh heh!

82
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:38,391
Hmm.

83
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:43,963
Head back, sweetie.

84
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:15,227
Mm-hmm.

85
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:24,003
One... final... touch.

86
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,074
There.

87
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:32,545
Ahh. Dazzle me.

88
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:43,255
Oh. A perfect match for Dean Deveraux.

89
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,260
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Deveraux?

90
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:50,362
Please don't hurt me.

91
00:05:50,364 --> 00:05:54,934
I don't understand why
we don't just kill him.

92
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:58,304
Because my sister is
watching me like a hawk.

93
00:05:58,306 --> 00:06:01,474
Still trying to bring the old Beth back.

94
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:03,075
You're not thinking of giving her

95
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:05,611
the old Beth back, are you?

96
00:06:05,613 --> 00:06:07,079
Of course not.

97
00:06:07,081 --> 00:06:09,315
Really? Because the old Alice I remember

98
00:06:09,317 --> 00:06:12,251
wouldn't give a second thought
about opening his throat

99
00:06:12,253 --> 00:06:13,652
with a butterfly knife.

100
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:15,121
She's changed you.

101
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:17,089
Not at all.

102
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,757
You're the one who's changed.

103
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:20,960
You used to trust me.

104
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:26,098
What about you, Dean?

105
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,766
Do you trust me?

106
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:30,970
I think you'd make an excellent partner.

107
00:06:30,972 --> 00:06:33,739
I seem to be in need of a replacement.

108
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,910
Stop. Stop.

109
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:40,513
I'll do whatever you want.

110
00:06:40,515 --> 00:06:43,282
Good.

111
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:46,285
Because I need you to steal
Catherine's shiny, new toy,

112
00:06:46,287 --> 00:06:49,855
the one that she's too stingy to share.

113
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,263
- You see the Bat-signal?
- That is why I'm here.

114
00:06:57,265 --> 00:06:58,831
You know what this means, right?

115
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,432
First time the city's called Batwoman

116
00:07:00,434 --> 00:07:02,668
for backup means I can't screw it up.

117
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,336
It means you're in.

118
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:06,472
GCPD's got you on their speed dial now.

119
00:07:06,474 --> 00:07:08,641
Commissioner Forbes trusts you.

120
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:11,710
Commissioner? My dad
still sees me as his enemy.

121
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:14,046
Stopping this guy has to
convince him otherwise.

122
00:07:14,048 --> 00:07:16,549
That's not the only
reason worth stopping him.

123
00:07:18,051 --> 00:07:21,687
Stanton was the prosecutor
who put away the guy

124
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,856
that killed my dad.

125
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:25,891
It was an armed robbery, right?

126
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:29,328
Night of my high school graduation.

127
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,799
We were celebrating me getting into MIT,

128
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,201
ran out of ice.

129
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:37,036
My dad went out to go get some.

130
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:39,338
Next thing I know, there
are two cops at the door.

131
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,974
Wanted me to come
down and I.D. the body.

132
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:49,048
We were waiting on him to cut the cake.

133
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,183
Lucius Fox did a lot
of good for this city.

134
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:53,485
Yeah. So did Stanton.

135
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:55,020
Never stopped until he put the guy

136
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:58,324
who shot my dad behind bars.

137
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:00,159
Any suspects?

138
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:02,528
Well, if you exclude the
law-abiding citizens of Gotham,

139
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,863
that leaves the other half.

140
00:08:04,865 --> 00:08:06,699
There has to be some
way to narrow that down.

141
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:08,500
Start with the violent offenders.

142
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:10,035
Cross reference with recent parolees,

143
00:08:10,037 --> 00:08:11,570
work release, and escapees

144
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:13,239
with whatever biometrics we can get

145
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:14,673
from the security footage.

146
00:08:14,675 --> 00:08:17,843
All right. Huh. This is interesting.

147
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,912
Chris Medlock, otherwise
known as Chris The Fist,

148
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:21,413
ex-boxer, ex-con.

149
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:24,383
What was The Fist in for?

150
00:08:24,385 --> 00:08:26,118
Uh, shot and killed a bartender.

151
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,520
He confessed, later
claimed it was coerced.

152
00:08:28,522 --> 00:08:30,389
But they found the gun in his car.

153
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:32,358
Pleaded down to second-degree murder,

154
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,860
got 30 in Blackgate.

155
00:08:33,862 --> 00:08:36,061
He was lucky to avoid the death penalty.

156
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:38,397
Yeah. The Fist did not see it that way.

157
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,266
Check out his sentencing.

158
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:48,474
I'll get you, you son of a bitch!

159
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:50,209
This ain't over!

160
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:51,644
I got a whole bunch
of time to figure out

161
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:53,112
how I'm gonna kill your ass!

162
00:08:53,114 --> 00:08:55,281
Thanks to overcrowding, he was paroled

163
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:57,316
just a few months ago.

164
00:08:57,318 --> 00:09:00,486
Can't wait to meet him.
Guy have an address?

165
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:03,656
We may not need one.

166
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:07,059
Uh, check out what just
came in over GCPD dispatch.

167
00:09:07,061 --> 00:09:08,594
Someone claiming to be The Executioner

168
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:09,895
barricaded himself inside a building

169
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:11,930
at the 200 block of Rucka Avenue.

170
00:09:11,932 --> 00:09:13,966
Claims to have several hostages.

171
00:09:13,968 --> 00:09:15,668
That's in West Harlow.

172
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,069
- Put it on the screen.
- OK.

173
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:19,438
All right. Let's get on this.

174
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,774
I don't care if it's
outside our district.

175
00:09:21,776 --> 00:09:24,243
Let's show Gotham we can keep them safe.

176
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:25,477
Move!

177
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,317
- Talking.
- Says he'll only speak to one guy,

178
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:41,927
a Detective Donnelly.

179
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:43,250
- Who?
- Detective Donnelly,

180
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:46,070
time is running out on
your hostages. Get in here,

181
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:48,990
- or I start shooting these people.
- Listen. You don't have to go in there.

182
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:53,772
- Let me get a negotiator down here.
- Nah. Me and The Fist go way back.

183
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:55,307
Detective.

184
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:03,048
Like the new look.

185
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:06,118
Red suits you.

186
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,886
Goes with everything.

187
00:10:07,888 --> 00:10:10,856
Time's up, Donnelly.

188
00:10:34,214 --> 00:10:36,582
No. Donnelly, stay back!

189
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:39,218
No. Wait! Stop!

190
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,363
I'm hit.

191
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:54,666
You're bleeding.

192
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:58,771
- I'll get you help.
- Thanks... Kate.

193
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,157
Oh, my God! Sophie!

194
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,160
I need to know if you can fix her.

195
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:16,929
What was she shot with?

196
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:18,864
- A bullet.
- I know it's a bullet.

197
00:11:18,866 --> 00:11:20,566
I mean, hollow point,
blackout, wadcutter?

198
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:21,967
Does it matter?

199
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:23,235
Why did you bring her here?

200
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:24,536
She can afford a real hospital.

201
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:26,238
You were closer, and, uh,

202
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,806
I need you to keep her until I get back.

203
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:29,341
Crows don't know she's missing.

204
00:11:29,343 --> 00:11:32,044
- No, you can't...
- Do not let her leave.

205
00:12:38,544 --> 00:12:40,646
Man of the hour.

206
00:12:40,648 --> 00:12:42,614
Congratulations.

207
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:44,650
You have succeeded where
so many have failed.

208
00:12:44,652 --> 00:12:48,420
The coil accelerator, it works at last.

209
00:12:48,422 --> 00:12:50,622
I just have to know

210
00:12:50,624 --> 00:12:52,591
how were you able to overcome

211
00:12:52,593 --> 00:12:56,962
the ferromagnetic projectile saturation?

212
00:12:56,964 --> 00:13:00,799
Ha ha! You almost had
me there, Ms. Hamilton.

213
00:13:00,801 --> 00:13:03,669
Trick question. That's
proprietary information.

214
00:13:05,905 --> 00:13:08,840
Hard to imagine...

215
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:11,576
Something so delicate
harnessing enough power

216
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:13,178
to penetrate the Batsuit.

217
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,684
Well done, Dean.

218
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,665
- She called you Kate?
- She knows who I am.

219
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:36,101
I mean it. That's just great, fantastic.

220
00:13:36,103 --> 00:13:37,936
So naturally, you
decided to drop her off

221
00:13:37,938 --> 00:13:39,538
at your sister's unlicensed clinic.

222
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,872
Mary will take care of her.

223
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:42,041
She'll also keep her from leaving,

224
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:43,809
and as long as she can't
leave, she can't talk.

225
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:45,644
But she's a Crow, your
father's second in command.

226
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:47,766
You really think you can
convince her not to tell him?

227
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:49,548
I'll deal with that after we've
dealt with The Executioner.

228
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,150
We need to figure out his next target.

229
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:52,551
Guy's not making it easy.

230
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:53,986
He keeps changing his M.O.

231
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:55,387
50,000 volts of electricity,

232
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:56,455
then a bunch of rifles.

233
00:13:56,457 --> 00:13:57,723
Doesn't make any sense.

234
00:13:57,725 --> 00:13:59,258
Unless it's a pattern.

235
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,327
The Fist dresses up as an executioner,

236
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:04,063
kills Stanton with electricity
like an electric chair.

237
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:07,266
Then he gets Donnelly to walk
in on that shooting gallery.

238
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:08,901
Like a firing squad.

239
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:11,503
He's using methods of capital
punishment to kill his victims.

240
00:14:11,505 --> 00:14:12,505
On it.

241
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:19,615
Gotham's used 3 ways to
kill people on death row...

242
00:14:19,617 --> 00:14:21,817
electric chair, firing squad...

243
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,319
which made a brief comeback
under Mayor Cobblepot...

244
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,588
and the gas chamber.

245
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,624
So his next victim will be with gas.

246
00:14:28,626 --> 00:14:29,992
Guy's got a flair for detail,

247
00:14:30,094 --> 00:14:32,500
so I bet you a batarang he'll
use hydrogen cyanide pellets

248
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:35,230
just like they did in
the gas chamber, and...

249
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,768
And there's only one warehouse
in Gotham that stores them.

250
00:14:54,398 --> 00:14:56,131
Who's there?

251
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:59,301
Someone who needs information.

252
00:14:59,303 --> 00:15:02,738
Holy crap! You're her!

253
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,141
Yo. I got to get this.

254
00:15:06,143 --> 00:15:08,450
- Damn, girl!
- Not happening.

255
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:10,612
Anything out of the
ordinary around here lately?

256
00:15:10,614 --> 00:15:13,448
- What, besides this?
- Answer the question.

257
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,751
Naw. That means someone
had to bet by me,

258
00:15:15,753 --> 00:15:18,787
and that ain't gonna happen.

259
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:21,089
It's been quiet,

260
00:15:21,091 --> 00:15:24,126
but, uh, you know,
it doesn't have to be.

261
00:15:24,128 --> 00:15:26,128
Yo. Let me buy you a drink,

262
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:30,065
and you can tell me all
about the superhero thing.

263
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:33,335
I've been thinking about
getting into the game myself.

264
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:35,337
What do you say?

265
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,241
I get off at 11:00, and, uh,
if you play your cards right,

266
00:15:39,243 --> 00:15:41,510
you won't be too far behind.

267
00:15:44,747 --> 00:15:47,149
OK. So this place hasn't seen any action

268
00:15:47,151 --> 00:15:49,785
and apparently neither has its guard.

269
00:15:49,787 --> 00:15:52,441
Yeah. I think I might know why.

270
00:15:52,442 --> 00:15:53,922
Got a visual on Chris The Fist,

271
00:15:53,924 --> 00:15:55,624
alleyway on Sprang.

272
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:12,774
Unh! Ooh!

273
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:21,049
Get off me! I didn't do nothing.

274
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:25,620
Oh, got it. So you're just
out for a late-night jog, huh?

275
00:16:25,622 --> 00:16:28,223
Crows got The Fist.

276
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:30,726
Well, I guess a lot of people
will be sleeping easier tonight.

277
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,794
I know you wanted to catch him,

278
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:35,130
but you can convince the Crows
you're not the enemy tomorrow.

279
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:38,533
Tomorrow may be too late.
I need to check on Sophie.

280
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:48,977
Unh!

281
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:57,486
Kate, you copy?

282
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,050
_

283
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:21,042
Hey, K... Kate!

284
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,616
Kate, do you copy? What just happened?

285
00:17:27,618 --> 00:17:29,785
The Crows got the wrong guy,

286
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:32,521
and The Executioner
got what he came for.

287
00:17:33,283 --> 00:17:36,218
All this Bat tech, and you
came up with frozen water?

288
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,867
Hmm. I checked every camera angle

289
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,935
in the warehouse security system, but,

290
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:42,704
the license plate's got
mud or something on it.

291
00:17:42,706 --> 00:17:44,772
Can't really get a good view of it.

292
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:46,774
Don't suppose you were
able to make it out.

293
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:50,211
Didn't quite catch it
when it plowed into me.

294
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:52,780
Oh. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's great!

295
00:17:52,782 --> 00:17:54,749
My ribs would argue otherwise.

296
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:56,084
No. I'm serious, OK?

297
00:17:56,086 --> 00:17:57,685
The suit's carbon fiber ribbing

298
00:17:57,687 --> 00:17:59,254
is designed to absorb any impact,

299
00:17:59,256 --> 00:18:00,955
so any deformation in the fibers is

300
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:02,624
recorded in the suit's data.

301
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:08,897
So it was originally
designed to track damage

302
00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:10,765
caused by bullets, you
know, blunt-force trauma,

303
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,800
that kind of thing.

304
00:18:12,802 --> 00:18:14,969
There's no reason it wouldn't pick up

305
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:17,739
- an impression from a car bumper.
- Or a license plate.

306
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:23,278
Hmm. OK. Uh, it's a
partial, but it'll work.

307
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,282
OK. The truck is registered
to a... Bertrand Eldon,

308
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:31,786
and... he was at Blackgate for 20 years.

309
00:18:31,788 --> 00:18:34,455
What was he in for?

310
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:37,792
He worked there. He
was their executioner.

311
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Uh-uh!

312
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,859
I just did some of the
best work of my life

313
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,594
crocheting you back together.

314
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,729
What?! Where am I?

315
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,765
Mary, what the hell is going on?

316
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:55,333
Batwoman brought you in.

317
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:58,269
- You were shot.
- Unh. Batwoman?

318
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,905
I feel like we glossed over the part

319
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,106
where I saved your life.

320
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:05,510
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

321
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,612
You work here?

322
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,580
It's mine.

323
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:12,683
My followers think I'm
turning up at the club,

324
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,452
ordering bottle service.

325
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:17,121
Truth is I'm usually here,

326
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:18,723
trying to help serve the people

327
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,460
that Gotham hospitals turn away.

328
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,094
- Mary.
- Hmm.

329
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:29,067
- If your dad ever found out about this place...
- He won't. He can't.

330
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,695
Yeah. I didn't do that.

331
00:19:34,697 --> 00:19:37,298
Well, you better undo it.

332
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,400
Batwoman would kill me.

333
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:41,502
Frankly, she's scarier than you.

334
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:44,839
Mary, why am I cuffed to this bed?

335
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:47,575
Uh, she said not to let you leave.

336
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:49,076
Do you know who she is?

337
00:19:49,078 --> 00:19:50,912
No. Honestly, I don't want to know.

338
00:19:50,914 --> 00:19:53,714
I don't need that
kind of responsibility.

339
00:19:53,716 --> 00:19:56,150
Well, I do know who she is,

340
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:58,553
and that's why she won't let me leave.

341
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:16,851
I'm in.

342
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,028
No one's home.

343
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,829
Why would a guy working
at Blackgate target

344
00:20:28,831 --> 00:20:30,031
a cop and a prosecutor?

345
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,299
They're on the same side.

346
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:34,201
That doesn't make any sense.

347
00:20:34,203 --> 00:20:36,270
I'm looking for that answer right now.

348
00:20:36,272 --> 00:20:39,540
Looks like he was a model employee.

349
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:42,143
Stay frosty. This guy is methodical,

350
00:20:42,145 --> 00:20:44,478
technically proficient,
always a few steps ahead.

351
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,180
He could have anything
waiting for you in there.

352
00:20:46,182 --> 00:20:48,316
Already has just sitting
on the coffee table.

353
00:20:48,318 --> 00:20:51,385
- What?
- The hydrogen cyanide pellets.

354
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:52,820
I found them.

355
00:20:52,822 --> 00:20:54,555
- On the coffee table?
- Yes.

356
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:56,123
It... it's probably a trap.

357
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,125
I'm aware, but I don't see

358
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:00,161
any trip sensors or wires

359
00:21:00,163 --> 00:21:02,296
or pressure plates.

360
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:05,232
What's the Bat protocol with this?

361
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:07,635
- Uh...
- Well, I can't just stand here

362
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:09,236
staring at this thing, waiting
for The Executioner to come back.

363
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:13,074
- Come on.
- Yeah. OK. Hang on.

364
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:16,243
Can you play some hold
music while I wait?

365
00:21:16,245 --> 00:21:17,712
No. OK. I'm just gonna grab it.

366
00:21:17,714 --> 00:21:19,647
No, no, no, no. Don't do that.

367
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:23,718
- Kate, don't!
- Too late.

368
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,687
- And?
- And I'm still talking to you.

369
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:27,855
It's light.

370
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:31,058
Is it empty?

371
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,426
Hmm.

372
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:33,594
Not quite.

373
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:49,210
So if you found this, then...
you found me, and, um...

374
00:21:49,212 --> 00:21:50,444
And I did it.

375
00:21:50,446 --> 00:21:52,113
I am guilty as sin,

376
00:21:52,115 --> 00:21:53,547
but I'm not the only one.

377
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:55,349
For 20 years, I threw the switch

378
00:21:55,351 --> 00:21:57,818
on the worst people
Gotham ever spat out.

379
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,954
I was glad to do it, too.

380
00:21:59,956 --> 00:22:02,289
Doing the public a service,
and it never bothered me

381
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:03,891
when they said they were innocent.

382
00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:05,860
Great. Sadistic and long-winded.

383
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:07,394
I mean, what else were
they gonna say, right?

384
00:22:07,396 --> 00:22:11,398
See, then all their stories,

385
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,800
they started to sound the same.

386
00:22:12,802 --> 00:22:15,035
The same names kept coming up,

387
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:16,904
same evidence,

388
00:22:16,906 --> 00:22:18,806
and everybody who sat in my chair

389
00:22:18,808 --> 00:22:20,808
started to look the same...

390
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,845
black, brown, poor.

391
00:22:24,847 --> 00:22:27,748
In 20 years, I never
juiced a rich white guy,

392
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,985
so I started digging in their files.

393
00:22:30,987 --> 00:22:33,721
You know what I found?

394
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:36,824
The same 3 corrupt law
enforcement officials

395
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:38,826
pulling the strings in every case.

396
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,598
Coerced confessions

397
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,702
and murder weapons suddenly
showing up out of nowhere.

398
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:51,172
I mean, obviously planted.

399
00:22:51,174 --> 00:22:54,508
Didn't Chris The Fist say
that his confession was coerced

400
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,044
and the murder weapon just
suddenly turned up in his car?

401
00:22:57,046 --> 00:23:00,014
The people that I
executed were innocent,

402
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:02,850
which meant that...

403
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:04,752
that I was the guilty one,

404
00:23:04,754 --> 00:23:09,089
that... that cabal, they
turned me into a murderer,

405
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:12,092
which... they made me
punish the innocent.

406
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:14,395
So who's the third member of this cabal?

407
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:18,699
Wait. You're not actually buying this?

408
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:22,036
OK. Believe me. I know racial
profiling is a thing in Gotham,

409
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:23,938
but this guy is obviously crazy,

410
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,273
almost killed Sophie,
nearly made you roadkill.

411
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:29,710
- Doesn't make him wrong.
- He's an admitted killer, Kate.

412
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:32,279
I knew Stanton, OK?

413
00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:35,416
He spent hours with my
family day after day,

414
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:38,452
and he never, ever stopped working

415
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:41,288
until he found justice.

416
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,058
If Stanton is accused of being dirty,

417
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,995
my dad's killer could use
that go get a new trial.

418
00:23:47,997 --> 00:23:49,964
But if Chris The Fist or anyone else

419
00:23:49,966 --> 00:23:51,665
can do go down for something
that they didn't do,

420
00:23:51,667 --> 00:23:53,601
how is that justice?

421
00:24:08,016 --> 00:24:09,850
A little present from the Crows.

422
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:12,686
Next time, call us first.

423
00:24:12,688 --> 00:24:14,288
We may not have a Klieg light,

424
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:16,523
but we do have a phone number.

425
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:19,793
Aah!

426
00:24:22,998 --> 00:24:24,632
Unh! Ohh!

427
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:37,378
Everybody fan out!

428
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,180
Move, move!

429
00:24:55,603 --> 00:24:58,271
Your turn.

430
00:24:58,273 --> 00:24:59,973
Uh, it... it's OK.

431
00:24:59,975 --> 00:25:02,475
You can just win.

432
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:10,149
I said... your turn.

433
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,395
King me.

434
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,903
What?!

435
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,439
It's me.

436
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:35,175
How did you get this number?

437
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:39,112
Let's call it twintuition.

438
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:41,514
Why did you send Mouse
into Hamilton Dynamics

439
00:25:41,516 --> 00:25:43,816
to get a weapon that can kill Batwoman?

440
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:47,520
- Where is he?
- He's fine,

441
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:51,791
or he will be as long
as you tell me the truth.

442
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:55,795
Heh. Dear sister, if
I wanted to kill you,

443
00:25:55,797 --> 00:25:58,331
I wouldn't have to wait for
you to be wearing the suit.

444
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:01,768
That's so sweet of you.

445
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:08,841
Your concern for me is
so touching, dear sister.

446
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:11,778
So Kate is Batwoman.

447
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:18,718
I do not like being toyed with!

448
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,154
And I don't like traitors.

449
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:23,022
What's wrong with you?

450
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:25,124
First, she abandons you, then
she tries to lock you away,

451
00:26:25,126 --> 00:26:27,193
and still, you try to protect her.

452
00:26:27,195 --> 00:26:30,496
Because she's still my sister.

453
00:26:30,498 --> 00:26:35,535
Real family doesn't abandon their own.

454
00:26:35,537 --> 00:26:39,305
Who snuck food to you in
the middle of the night?

455
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:41,007
Who taught you rummy

456
00:26:41,009 --> 00:26:43,476
and let you sleep with Mr. Pandy

457
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,912
and promised to protect
you no matter what?

458
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:50,383
Me! I did, Alice, because I was there,

459
00:26:50,385 --> 00:26:53,219
and she wasn't!

460
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:57,256
After everything we've been through,

461
00:26:57,258 --> 00:27:00,560
you keep secrets from me?

462
00:27:07,368 --> 00:27:09,235
Try keeping that a secret.

463
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:19,709
OK. So who had Batwoman
rescues a psychopath

464
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:21,377
on their bingo card?

465
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:23,079
Because I've got some
big, fat, empty spaces

466
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:25,281
for Batwoman takes down Alice

467
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:27,517
and Batwoman gets a cat out of a tree.

468
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,419
Talk to me, Gotham. Anyone else feeling

469
00:27:29,421 --> 00:27:31,387
a little "Bat-trayed"?

470
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:33,957
The people that I
executed were innocent,

471
00:27:33,959 --> 00:27:36,759
which meant that...

472
00:27:36,761 --> 00:27:38,394
that I was the guilty one.

473
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:40,563
That cabal by Judge Calverick

474
00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:43,399
condemned innocent people to die.

475
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:45,435
I heard you got a visit from Batwoman.

476
00:27:45,437 --> 00:27:46,936
More like an ambush.

477
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:49,205
Now one nut job wants me to listen

478
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:50,773
to another nut job.

479
00:27:50,775 --> 00:27:52,642
Claims Judge Calverick, one of Gotham's

480
00:27:52,644 --> 00:27:55,478
most upstanding justices, is a fraud.

481
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,647
So you're not even gonna
look into this judge.

482
00:27:57,649 --> 00:27:59,882
Why? Because some social justice warrior

483
00:27:59,884 --> 00:28:01,985
thinks he knows more
about the rule of law

484
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:04,087
than the cops and the
lawyers who protect this city?

485
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:05,588
Nah. We got the right guy.

486
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,590
Batwoman interfered.

487
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:09,158
Batwoman wouldn't have stepped
in if she didn't have a reason.

488
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,960
Before you give a shred of credibility

489
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:13,263
to some criminal in a Bat costume,

490
00:28:13,265 --> 00:28:16,599
let me remind you that Batman
destroyed our family's lives.

491
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:18,968
He is not the one that drove
Mom's car off that bridge.

492
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,837
Well, he may as well have been.

493
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,972
Batman brought out all
the crazies in Gotham.

494
00:28:22,974 --> 00:28:24,440
If it weren't for him, there
wouldn't have been a Joker!

495
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:25,842
Your mom would be alive,

496
00:28:25,844 --> 00:28:27,577
and Beth wouldn't be Alice.

497
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:30,346
Beth is Alice because we
stopped looking for her.

498
00:28:33,117 --> 00:28:34,984
I'm not arguing about this right now.

499
00:28:34,986 --> 00:28:36,953
That would be a lot easier, wouldn't it,

500
00:28:36,955 --> 00:28:40,323
just act like we did nothing wrong.

501
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:43,459
We looked... Everywhere for Beth.

502
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:46,429
I looked everywhere. I held
onto hope for the both of us

503
00:28:46,431 --> 00:28:48,031
despite the lack of evidence,

504
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:49,799
despite the police giving up,

505
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:52,602
despite the fact that
everyone thought she was dead.

506
00:28:52,604 --> 00:28:54,437
I hoped when it was hard,

507
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:56,806
and you... Just gave up

508
00:28:56,808 --> 00:28:58,708
and put your energy into blaming Batman

509
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,844
because it was easy.

510
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:03,780
That's why Beth is Alice.

511
00:29:06,283 --> 00:29:08,551
You wouldn't listen then,
and you won't listen now,

512
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:11,054
and an innocent man is
gonna pay the price for it.

513
00:29:30,808 --> 00:29:34,511
Look who lucked out by getting
the last grape Popsicle!

514
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:37,213
Hmm. Looks like you're healing nicely,

515
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:39,382
but I guess healing can't get in the way

516
00:29:39,384 --> 00:29:42,218
of you spilling the tea on Batwoman.

517
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,187
Believe it or not, I'm
trying to protect her.

518
00:29:44,189 --> 00:29:46,556
By having my dad shut
down her entire operation?

519
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:48,057
She's gonna get herself killed.

520
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:50,426
Batwoman can take care of herself

521
00:29:50,428 --> 00:29:52,995
just like she took care
of you twice by my count,

522
00:29:52,997 --> 00:29:55,431
and now you're just gonna betray her?

523
00:29:55,433 --> 00:29:58,101
Uh... I mean, what?

524
00:29:58,103 --> 00:30:00,169
Is that, like, your thing?

525
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:01,838
What's that supposed to mean?

526
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,272
I mean, that's what you did to Kate,

527
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:04,841
and then she had to put an entire ocean

528
00:30:04,843 --> 00:30:06,542
between you and her,

529
00:30:06,544 --> 00:30:09,278
and... now you walk around,

530
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,848
pretend like she meant nothing to you.

531
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,516
You don't even know what happened.

532
00:30:13,518 --> 00:30:17,854
No, but I saw what it did to her.

533
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,256
Look. You're right. It's not my drama,

534
00:30:20,258 --> 00:30:24,360
so do what you want.

535
00:30:24,362 --> 00:30:26,896
In the meantime,

536
00:30:26,898 --> 00:30:29,532
ibuprofen every 4-6 hours

537
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:31,300
and change the bandage once a day.

538
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:33,302
Don't tell my dad about this clinic...

539
00:30:34,638 --> 00:30:36,539
And maybe think about whether or not

540
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,741
you want to add Batwoman to
the list of people you hurt.

541
00:30:55,223 --> 00:30:57,191
Working late, Your Honor?

542
00:30:57,893 --> 00:30:58,926
H... how did you?

543
00:30:59,028 --> 00:31:01,108
Looks like you're burning
more than the midnight oil.

544
00:31:01,964 --> 00:31:03,730
Is that the evidence?

545
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:05,408
Donnelly got the confessions,

546
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,043
Stanton convinced the jury,

547
00:31:07,045 --> 00:31:08,745
you just banged your gavel?

548
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:10,146
I can pay you.

549
00:31:10,148 --> 00:31:11,882
You have to protect me from him.

550
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:14,150
You'll get round-the-clock
protection at Blackgate

551
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:15,886
free of charge.

552
00:31:27,565 --> 00:31:29,399
Go!

553
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:30,734
Unh!

554
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:35,472
You protect him, a man who sent

555
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:36,940
so many innocents to their deaths?

556
00:31:36,942 --> 00:31:38,441
The law will take care of it.

557
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:40,677
Yeah? I used to believe that, too,

558
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:42,979
until the law turned me into a murderer.

559
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:44,514
The law's not perfect,
I'll give you that.

560
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:47,250
Doesn't mean you get
to rewrite it in blood.

561
00:31:47,252 --> 00:31:49,486
You trust the law so much,

562
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:51,121
why are you wearing that suit?

563
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:52,856
I'm gonna need backup.

564
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:53,990
What do you want me to say?

565
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:55,158
He makes a good point.

566
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,760
No. For the judge.

567
00:31:56,762 --> 00:31:58,361
Get the judge into
protective custody now.

568
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,497
Right. On it.

569
00:32:31,495 --> 00:32:33,330
Sweep the rest of the building.

570
00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:53,650
Glad you decided to
go after the right guy.

571
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:55,552
I don't see how you and
him are that different.

572
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:57,921
Taking the law into your own hands,

573
00:32:57,923 --> 00:33:02,359
appointing yourself judge and jury.

574
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,894
Pretty sure you just
did the exact same thing.

575
00:33:04,896 --> 00:33:06,863
I saved your life.

576
00:33:06,865 --> 00:33:08,698
You telling me I made a mistake?

577
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,101
I don't know. Ask The Fist.

578
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,937
I admit I got it wrong,

579
00:33:13,939 --> 00:33:16,039
but you know the difference
between me and you?

580
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,208
When I make a mistake,
everybody knows my name.

581
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,909
I am accountable to
the people of Gotham.

582
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:25,048
You... you hide behind your anonymity.

583
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,385
Who are you accountable to?

584
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:31,421
Guess we'll find out.

585
00:33:49,707 --> 00:33:52,976
Heart rate monitor linked
to a dead man's switch.

586
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:00,450
Looks like we're about to join him.

587
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,761
This is Kane. Anybody read me?

588
00:34:11,763 --> 00:34:13,496
Whoa! Suit showing
oxygen levels dropping.

589
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,499
No kidding. Executioner turned this room

590
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:17,934
into a gas chamber.

591
00:34:17,936 --> 00:34:19,469
Can your men get us out of here?

592
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:20,970
He triggered the lock-down procedure.

593
00:34:20,972 --> 00:34:23,406
Every way in and out
of here is sealed off.

594
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:26,242
Steel-reinforced doors.

595
00:34:26,244 --> 00:34:28,678
By the time my guys get through them...

596
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:34,984
Air's getting thin in here. I
need a solution. You went to MIT.

597
00:34:34,986 --> 00:34:38,088
I got in. I didn't actually go.

598
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,025
OK. Uh... OK, OK.

599
00:34:42,027 --> 00:34:44,568
OK. Hydrogen cyanide,
emphasis on hydrogen.

600
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:46,830
It's flammable. Think the Hindenburg.

601
00:34:46,832 --> 00:34:49,060
- Not a comforting thought.
- The point is you can ignite it.

602
00:34:49,061 --> 00:34:50,167
The flames will burn off the cyanide.

603
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:51,630
- OK. Copy.
- Only problem is

604
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:53,471
hydrogen will only
burn at 6% saturation.

605
00:34:53,773 --> 00:34:55,472
For those of us who didn't get into MIT.

606
00:34:55,474 --> 00:34:57,741
You got let the gas fill the room first.

607
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:01,458
We're not gonna last that long.

608
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,926
Well, you got to try, Kate.

609
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:04,294
You're only at 3%.

610
00:35:04,296 --> 00:35:05,662
You got hang in there.

611
00:35:05,664 --> 00:35:07,064
You need to stay low to the ground.

612
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:08,665
- Get away from me.
- Come on.

613
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,401
That symbol took everything from me.

614
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:13,937
It's not gonna be the last thing I see.

615
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,997
Stay with me. Stay awake.

616
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:19,066
Come on, Commander. Talk to me.

617
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:21,735
Tell me all the reasons you hate Batman.

618
00:35:21,737 --> 00:35:24,338
That symbol let my family die.

619
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:30,043
4%.

620
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,447
Hey. If you're gonna hate
the symbol, hate the symbol.

621
00:35:33,449 --> 00:35:35,916
Let it fuel you into staying alive.

622
00:35:35,918 --> 00:35:37,951
5%.

623
00:35:37,953 --> 00:35:39,953
I have to blame that symbol.

624
00:35:39,955 --> 00:35:43,056
If I don't...

625
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,759
If you don't, what? Tell me.

626
00:35:45,761 --> 00:35:47,928
I have to blame myself.

627
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,032
6%. Do it!

628
00:35:59,474 --> 00:36:01,408
Kate, come on. Talk to me.

629
00:36:06,214 --> 00:36:08,649
Commander, Commander, come on!

630
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:13,987
We're OK.

631
00:36:14,837 --> 00:36:17,771
Never let it be said
that Gotham's gadfly

632
00:36:17,773 --> 00:36:19,373
does not give credit
where credit is due.

633
00:36:19,688 --> 00:36:21,354
Batwoman got this one right,

634
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:23,122
and the rest of us whiffed.

635
00:36:23,124 --> 00:36:24,924
Guess Jacob Kane won't be the only one

636
00:36:24,926 --> 00:36:27,260
eating a little Crow.

637
00:36:27,262 --> 00:36:30,663
Boxer Chris "The Fist"
Medlock was not only cleared

638
00:36:30,665 --> 00:36:33,933
in The Executioner
murders but also exonerated

639
00:36:33,935 --> 00:36:35,868
of his past murder conviction.

640
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,670
Talk about a one-two punch.

641
00:36:37,672 --> 00:36:39,973
Not so good news for
the man who convicted him

642
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:41,708
Judge Raymond Calverick.

643
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:45,144
The D.A. has vowed to
reopen all cases tainted

644
00:36:45,146 --> 00:36:47,046
by this extralegal cabal,

645
00:36:47,048 --> 00:36:50,149
including deceased
Detective Stu Donnelly

646
00:36:50,151 --> 00:36:52,051
and prosecutor Angus Stanton.

647
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:02,028
You're right behind me, aren't you?

648
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,130
Where is she?

649
00:37:04,132 --> 00:37:07,166
I... you know, she just left.

650
00:37:07,168 --> 00:37:10,837
- Uh, how can I put this?
- You let her escape?

651
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:13,172
I know you said to hold onto her,

652
00:37:13,174 --> 00:37:14,841
but my stepdad is her boss,

653
00:37:14,843 --> 00:37:17,710
and I'm running a little
short on family right now,

654
00:37:17,712 --> 00:37:19,912
not that you asked
about my personal life,

655
00:37:19,914 --> 00:37:21,581
but it's a mess.

656
00:37:21,583 --> 00:37:23,082
The last thing I need
is him shutting down

657
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:24,984
the one good thing I have going on.

658
00:37:24,986 --> 00:37:27,353
Thank you for saving her life.

659
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:30,723
Oh. Yeah. It's, like, my thing.

660
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:36,229
Hey. FYI, she knows who you are.

661
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:39,532
Hey. Chill. She didn't tell me,

662
00:37:39,534 --> 00:37:41,934
but I got the distinct impression

663
00:37:41,936 --> 00:37:44,270
that she's gonna tell my stepdad,

664
00:37:44,272 --> 00:37:46,005
so good luck with that.

665
00:37:59,053 --> 00:38:01,020
Well, Bruce, now I know how much

666
00:38:01,022 --> 00:38:03,089
it must have hurt hearing
your uncle blame you

667
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:05,291
for what happened on the bridge,

668
00:38:05,293 --> 00:38:07,927
but he had to blame someone.

669
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:10,396
Seeing him fight so
hard to avoid the truth

670
00:38:10,398 --> 00:38:12,298
that was right in front of him

671
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:16,369
made me realize I was
doing the same thing.

672
00:38:16,371 --> 00:38:20,073
I've been blaming my dad
for not saving Beth that day,

673
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:24,777
but it wasn't his hand on that
door only inches away from her.

674
00:38:27,215 --> 00:38:28,981
He wasn't the one who crossed that house

675
00:38:28,983 --> 00:38:32,785
off the list of places
where Beth could be.

676
00:38:41,796 --> 00:38:44,230
I don't know how,

677
00:38:44,232 --> 00:38:46,933
but we are gonna get Beth back,

678
00:38:46,935 --> 00:38:50,736
and this time, I swear to you

679
00:38:50,738 --> 00:38:52,438
I won't ever give up.

680
00:38:57,579 --> 00:38:59,345
I don't know if forgiving my father

681
00:38:59,347 --> 00:39:03,182
will help me forgive
myself, but I have to try.

682
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:30,856
I thought I might find you here.

683
00:39:36,597 --> 00:39:42,635
How could you ever think I was
trying to replace you, little Mouse.

684
00:39:42,637 --> 00:39:46,539
Why are you so
determined to protect her?

685
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:50,710
Because I'm saving her
a seat at our tea party!

686
00:39:50,712 --> 00:39:55,081
It was supposed to be a table for two.

687
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:59,785
Yes, the two of us,

688
00:39:59,787 --> 00:40:03,422
two halves of one whole

689
00:40:03,424 --> 00:40:05,124
just as Kate and I are two halves,

690
00:40:05,126 --> 00:40:07,560
and I need your help to make us whole.

691
00:40:07,562 --> 00:40:09,762
I can't do this without you.

692
00:40:09,764 --> 00:40:14,400
I don't want to share you with her.

693
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:16,002
Mouse.

694
00:40:22,442 --> 00:40:25,945
You won't have to share me

695
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:28,581
because we'll be sharing her.

696
00:40:31,752 --> 00:40:34,754
And what if she doesn't want to play?

697
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:37,757
Well...

698
00:40:37,759 --> 00:40:40,926
Then it's good we have that then, hmm?

699
00:40:48,368 --> 00:40:51,604
Trade you Mr. Pandy for it.

700
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:53,673
You kept it?

701
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:55,808
To remind me of you.
