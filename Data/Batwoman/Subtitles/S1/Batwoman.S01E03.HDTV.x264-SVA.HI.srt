00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:32,241
I'd like that.

717
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:01,684
JACOB: Catherine?

718
00:40:01,806 --> 00:40:03,931
Catherine?

719
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:07,300
There you are. You okay?

720
00:40:07,303 --> 00:40:10,763
Alice broke into our home
and murdered that guard.

721
00:40:10,765 --> 00:40:12,189
You have to stop her, Jacob.

722
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:14,264
I know. We're gonna find her.

723
00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:15,692
And put an end to this.

724
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:17,403
When Alice called, she was playing

725
00:40:17,406 --> 00:40:23,125
a song on Beth's cello... Bach.

726
00:40:23,128 --> 00:40:25,766
I used to tell Beth it was our song.

727
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:29,281
She could have found one
of Beth's recitals online.

728
00:40:29,283 --> 00:40:32,229
You're smarter than that, Jacob.

729
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:34,542
Jacob, don't let her in.

730
00:40:37,857 --> 00:40:41,168
KATE, VOICE-OVER: I wasn't
afraid of letting down the city.

731
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,672
I was afraid of letting down you, Bruce,

732
00:40:45,674 --> 00:40:47,650
but whatever happens,

733
00:40:47,652 --> 00:40:50,343
whatever I face,

734
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:52,063
it's worth it.

735
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:54,632
VESPER: Okay, Gotham. Someone just dropped

736
00:40:54,635 --> 00:40:58,185
a bombshell on this city,
and I mean that literally.

737
00:40:58,187 --> 00:41:00,020
The Bat is back...

738
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:02,464
Just curvier and sexier,

739
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:05,048
so the big question,
what are we calling her...

740
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:06,841
Batlady, Batchick?

741
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:09,618
Talk to me, Gotham. We need a name.

742
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:11,270
Batwoman.

743
00:41:14,952 --> 00:41:18,891
