1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,920
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:07,960
Tommy said that this book
holds the key to killing Batwoman.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,880
And I want her very, very dead.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,480
Lucius Fox wrote
the entire journal in code.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,960
You did it. You know what it says.
Why aren't you happier about this?

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,200
The book contains the secret
to killing you.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,680
These are Lucius Fox's glasses.
They unlock the code.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,440
Let Luke and Julia go
and they're yours.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,520
Go bring me Tommy so he can tell me
where to find

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,320
a little green rock
called kryptonite.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,520
I have to do this.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,000
- I have to stop you.
- You won't be able to.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,280
- You'd be surprised.
- Kryptonite? Why do you have that?

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,240
It was Bruce Wayne's.
He lost hope. I never will.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,440
Keep it. I have the courage
that you'll never have to use it.

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,760
Batwoman's in cell block D.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,520
No. Please, don't.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,040
Psychotic escapees are all over
this city right now thanks to you.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,400
Let this serve as your warning.
If I see you again, it's war.

20
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,640
<i>This is the Burnley Line,
bound for Central Gotham.</i>

21
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,200
Knife! Hey! Hey!

22
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,160
Go.

23
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,120
Move! Move! Move! Out of the way!

24
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,720
Knife! Knife! Knife!
Get away from the trains!

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,120
Get away from the trains!

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,920
Drop the knives.

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,440
Why? So you can send me back there?

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,360
These are innocent people!

29
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,800
I don't care!

30
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,560
I told you to stay in the car.

31
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,320
Who the hell was that?

32
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,840
I have no idea.

33
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,040
<i>Rumor has it the machete-wielding
maniac was Arkham escapee</i>

34
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
<i>and college football phenom,
Tim "The Titan" Teslow.</i>

35
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,160
<i>Since apparently, the Crows'
commander couldn't take down</i>

36
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,320
<i>this hulking Gotham Goliaths'
tight end with a 12-gauge,</i>

37
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,920
<i>let's hope Batwoman
has a slingshot in her Batbelt.</i>

38
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,040
Have you seen this?

39
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,560
The Crows have an app now.

40
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,360
Darling, my light.

41
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,880
{\an5}It's hard enough to see
out of Lucius Fox's glasses.

42
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,320
{\an5}You just push the button
and the ants come marching in.

43
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,200
Anyone with a phone can use it,
client or not.

44
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,840
Which means anyone with a phone

45
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,640
can turn us over
with the click of a screen.

46
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,880
We gotta get out of Gotham, Alice.

47
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,880
What is that?

48
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,200
The bats! What is happening?
Why are they here?

49
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,840
{\an5}Because bats eat rats, Alice.
And that's what we are down here.

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,120
{\an5}We're rats living among rats.

51
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,120
{\an5}You promised me that we would start
a new life together

52
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,880
{\an5}outside of all this.

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,080
{\an5}But we can't do that
if the Crows find us and kill us.

54
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,360
{\an5}How is one supposed to start anew

55
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,640
{\an5}when all that is old
still haunts her?

56
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,120
Is that the Alice you want
to frolic beside in our Wonderland?

57
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,760
{\an5}Or do you wish your Alice to be full,
and complete and happy?

58
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
You know that's what I want.

59
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,680
Then patience,

60
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,280
until I can figure out
where to find this rock

61
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,960
that penetrates the Batsuit.

62
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,200
{\an5}A hiding spot Lucius Fox
forgot to mention in his journal.

63
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,440
Alice!

64
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,680
What the hell is this?

65
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,760
{\an5}You call this... This a face?

66
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,360
- Really? This?
- I mean...

67
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,800
I don't see the problem.

68
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,760
I got you the journal.
I helped you decode it.

69
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,200
{\an5}Because of me, you know how
to kill your sister, Batwoman!

70
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
It's true.

71
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,240
But I am not about to spend
the rest of my life

72
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,800
{\an5}looking like the bastard
that couldn't get the rods

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,120
in the nuclear reactor in time!

74
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,440
Give me a face I can wear.

75
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,080
That's good.

76
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,720
{\an5}Shoot her dead. That'll get you
your face, you stupid idiot.

77
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
It's quite all right, Mouse.

78
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
I can take a note.

79
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,440
Wait, what?

80
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,600
{\an5}No. You can't actually
be listening to him.

81
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,920
I owe him a face.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,080
{\an5}Which means I'll need to go
to the university morgue

83
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,440
for better materials.

84
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,480
Skin, thread, scalpels,
you know the drill.

85
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,400
- Back soon.
- Alice...

86
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,640
You are holding the only shard
of kryptonite on the planet.

87
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,400
Why was this in a puddle
in the Batcave?

88
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,280
Safekeeping.

89
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,200
Bruce was holding on to it
for a friend.

90
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,040
Let me guess, tights, cape,
big S on his chest.

91
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,640
Yo... how do you know that?

92
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Lucky guess.

93
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,400
So, why fish it out
of a perfectly good hiding space?

94
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,280
{\an5}Alice knows this can penetrate
the Batsuit

95
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,160
{\an5}along with whatever else my dad
wrote about it in his journal.

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,400
Hamilton's coil accelerator
is defunct,

97
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,200
you melted down Bruce's rail gun

98
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,120
{\an5}and once I figure out
how to destroy this

99
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,720
{\an5}Batwoman is as good as invincible.

100
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,120
Unless you know something I don't.

101
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,800
{\an5}Nope. Go to town.

102
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
{\an5}Okay.

103
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,360
Hey. I thought we were bat-huddling
over this Titan Teslow psycho.

104
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,680
"Bat-huddling" isn't a thing.

105
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,080
And I'm off to destroy
an alien mineral.

106
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,480
Just another day on the Bat team?

107
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,760
Pretty much.

108
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,520
{\an5}So, Tim "The Titan" Teslow,
obviously you know the basics, right?

109
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,280
{\an5}Just remind me again?

110
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,160
He was pretty much the Goliaths'
best tight end of all time.

111
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,520
{\an5}A TD every game,
over a hundred catches

112
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,800
{\an5}and a thousand yards every season.

113
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,800
Let's not assume I know
what any of those words mean

114
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,960
because I'm a lesbian.

115
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,600
He was really, really good.
And brutal.

116
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,280
As in gladiator-esque.

117
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,200
Turns out, there's a not-so-secret
secret to all of his success.

118
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,120
- Say it with me, steroids.
- Sexy cheerleaders.

119
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,000
Point being, it all came to a head

120
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,120
during a playoff game
against the Cougars.

121
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,480
Titan didn't like a call

122
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,720
and went straight up <i>Mortal Kombat</i>
finishing move

123
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,280
against the official.

124
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,000
He snapped his neck on the field
in front of a stadium full of people.

125
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,760
Since when did
you become a Goliaths fan?

126
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,920
Since Titan's brother, Apollo,
started dating Selu Corova.

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,160
Apollo's the Goliaths' running back.

128
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,960
You seriously need to get out
of that Batcave.

129
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,840
I seriously need to suit up
and talk to this brother.

130
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,960
- Might know Titan's whereabouts.
- Are we sure that's the best idea?

131
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,640
I do,
Ms. Batwoman-Doesn't-Get-a-Sick-Day.

132
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,680
I said that
before Commander Kane promised

133
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,520
if he ever saw Batwoman again,

134
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,960
it'd be war.

135
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,880
I feel like Gotham's
got enough Greek tragedy

136
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,400
happening at the moment.

137
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,040
You don't know my dad like I do.

138
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,920
I do, though,...
because he's my dad too.

139
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,200
Not what I meant. Just...

140
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,480
I know how he gets and I know ways
of getting around him.

141
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,120
Like when teenage Kate
wanted a Crows SUV,

142
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
he said no, you took one anyway

143
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,120
and he had you arrested?

144
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Or when he said no parties
in the penthouse

145
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,600
and you had one anyway,

146
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,680
and he called the police commissioner
to land a helicopter on the roof

147
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,680
to have you arrested?

148
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,160
I can keep going.

149
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,880
If I can stop Titan
before he kills anyone else,

150
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,640
then my dad
and the rest of the Crows,

151
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,480
they might start seeing Batwoman
as one of the good guys.

152
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,240
Jacob Kane will never see
a vigilante as one of the good guys.

153
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,280
Jacob Kane has never met a vigilante
who is also his daughter.

154
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,200
If I can start changing the way
that he sees Batwoman

155
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,920
then maybe one day I can come clean
about who Batwoman really is.

156
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,200
<i>I'm a winner, I'm a, I'm a winner</i>

157
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,400
<i>Independent, make my own moola</i>

158
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,600
<i>I'm a winner, my own breadwinner</i>

159
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,440
<i>Girl in the mirror, a go, go-getter</i>

160
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,000
<i>Go, go-getter</i>

161
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,400
<i>Go, go-getter</i>

162
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,400
Professor Darby, I presume?

163
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,480
<i>A go, go-getter</i>

164
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
You...

165
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,560
For a man
who plays with rocks all day,

166
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,280
this must be very exciting.

167
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,880
But it doesn't have to be.

168
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,960
I am looking for a little
green nugget called kryptonite.

169
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
Kryptonite.

170
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,480
You mean kaolinite.

171
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,200
Do I, or do I mean kryptonite?

172
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,920
Maybe kimberlite?

173
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,120
Or kyanite?

174
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,200
Or, um, charoite?

175
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,360
The head of the Geology Department
and dumb as...

176
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,440
Professor Darby, your name
was written beside it in a journal.

177
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,200
Glows green, cuts through anything.

178
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,160
A mineral with a natural
green luminescence

179
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,640
and strong covalent bonds
with that kind of cutting power.

180
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,480
Actually, I did analyze something
with those properties once.

181
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,720
It wasn't called kryptonite.

182
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,440
It was some kind of rare meteor rock.

183
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,640
There you go.

184
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Hand it over.

185
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,800
I can't, it was sent back
to its owner, Lucius Fox.

186
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,480
Lucius Fox is dead.

187
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,480
It just says Lucius Fox,
Wayne Enterprises, Gotham City.

188
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,080
And what do you suppose I do?

189
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,880
Just waltz into Wayne
and ask for it nicely?

190
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,520
I don't know, okay?

191
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,920
It's not here.

192
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,640
You need to go talk to them.

193
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,320
Well, then I suppose
that's what I'll do.

194
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:56,200
Until then, it's probably best
nobody knows I was here.

195
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,920
And with that...

196
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,480
I believe the Geology Department
needs a new head.

197
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
Still hasn't checked in
since you looked ten seconds ago.

198
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,920
Sorry if the idea
of my dad killing my sister

199
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,840
is somewhat of a concern to me.

200
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,960
Her suit is bulletproof.
Besides, Kate knows what she's doing.

201
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
No, Kate thinks she knows
what she's doing,

202
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,280
which can be worse than most people
not knowing what they're doing.

203
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,160
Yeah, me included, apparently.

204
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:40,320
Look, I've tried acetic,
sulfuric and hydrochloric.

205
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,560
All non-reactive.

206
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,600
I can see why this thing
can penetrate the Batsuit.

207
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,080
Have you tried crushing it?

208
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,560
With what, a hammer?

209
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,920
- I said I was nervous.
- All right.

210
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,400
<i>I like the pressure
I like the pressure</i>

211
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,440
<i>Not afraid of the storm
'Cause it's all mine</i>

212
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,040
I'm exhausted just watching you.

213
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,240
Who's there?

214
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,040
Someone who thinks you're pretty bold

215
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,960
to be running bleachers
with Titan on the prowl.

216
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,680
If this is about season tickets,
I can't help you.

217
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,960
If this is about my brother,
I can't help you.

218
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,600
I guess my question is
are you helping him?

219
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,040
You're the only family he has left.

220
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,440
I don't think he sees it that way.

221
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,480
Not after I testified against him

222
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,600
- and got him sent away to Arkham.
- You did the right thing.

223
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,120
Got a dangerous psychopath
off the streets.

224
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,240
He's not a psychopath.

225
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,800
Tell that to the ref
he murdered on the field.

226
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,280
He wanted to win,

227
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,440
so much that he was willing
to have his soul beaten out of him.

228
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
Every practice, every game,
every hit to the head.

229
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
You know he used to walk
the neighborhood kids

230
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,200
to the bus to make sure
they were safe?

231
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,160
Ten years later, he ripped
a ref's spine out of his neck.

232
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,800
This game turned him into a monster.

233
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,600
Then help me make sure
he doesn't die one.

234
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,160
Make sure he gets the help he needs.

235
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,120
Tell me where to find him.

236
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,120
Apollo! You betrayed me!

237
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,680
This is the part where you run.

238
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,360
You abandoned me to the prison.

239
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,520
Now this one will be yours.

240
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,760
I'm reporting live here at the scene

241
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,200
of yet another grisly attack
by the fugitive,

242
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,040
Tim "The Titan" Teslow.

243
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,360
And this time,
the victim was his own brother,

244
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,480
star running back
for the Gotham Goliaths,

245
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,760
Apollo Teslow.

246
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,720
Commander Kane.

247
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,160
Commander Kane,
any comments on this latest attack?

248
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,200
And what about reports that not even
Batwoman was able to stop Titan?

249
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,080
Batwoman is the reason lunatics

250
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,200
like Titan are on the street
in the first place.

251
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,000
We got one man dead

252
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,920
and one of Gotham's
most promising athletes

253
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,800
- cut down in his prime.
- So you don't see Batwoman's efforts

254
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,520
to stop Titan as helpful?

255
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,960
I see Batwoman
like I see every vigilante,

256
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,000
a threat to the good people
of this city.

257
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,560
The Crows and the GCPD
will bring her to justice.

258
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,920
And we will not discriminate
between the Bat

259
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,680
and those who aid her, abet her,

260
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,160
or so much as turn on
a damn Batlight!

261
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,960
<i>That was Crows Commander Kane</i>

262
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,640
<i>with some pointed words
for Batwoman and her followers.</i>

263
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,560
<i>I don't remember tensions like these
since Commissioner Loeb and Batman.</i>

264
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,320
<i>Which begs the question who,</i>

265
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,120
<i>if anyone,
can keep Gotham City safe...</i>

266
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm gonna have to reset
your shoulder.

267
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,520
Fair warning,
this is gonna hurt a lot.

268
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,400
No comment.

269
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,200
That was Julia.
She saw your dad on the news

270
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,680
and thinks
you should sit this one out.

271
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,600
You might not have a choice.

272
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,240
I'll need an x-ray to make sure,

273
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,720
but I'm guessing you have
a couple of cracked ribs.

274
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,600
I'll be lucky if it's just a couple.

275
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,880
I've never been up against someone
this strong before, Mary.

276
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,360
It was like I was nothing to him.

277
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,960
All the more reason
to avoid a rematch.

278
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,680
At least for a few weeks
till you've had time to heal.

279
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,200
I don't have a few weeks.

280
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,600
Titan's on some killing spree

281
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,400
and we have no way of knowing
who he's gonna strike at next.

282
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,840
Actually, maybe we do.
You're not gonna believe this.

283
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,640
That commuter he beheaded
on the subway

284
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,920
wasn't just some random guy.

285
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,360
He had a connection to Titan.

286
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,800
He used to be an administrator
at his university's neuro clinic

287
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,760
until he was fired for falsifying
student athletes' brain scans.

288
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,040
Apollo said the game
turned his brother into a monster.

289
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,760
Or the people behind the game.

290
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,840
Where's the rock?

291
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,320
Hidden among 45 stories of anywhere

292
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,480
and a million square feet
of possibility.

293
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,680
Our beloved little rock
may as well be

294
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,480
a grain of sand along the beach.

295
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,040
So...

296
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,400
That's it, then. It's not happening.
It's over. We can leave now.

297
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,560
Or we can walk right through the door
and ask for it.

298
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Hey.

299
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,640
What are you doing?

300
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,840
Everyone knows eyebrows
don't grow themselves.

301
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,560
You're making him a face.

302
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,720
You promised me
we were gonna kill him.

303
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,200
We will! But today,
he's an integral part of my plan.

304
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,200
And tomorrow, what then?

305
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,600
And the next day, what then?
When does this end?

306
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,440
Why are you pressuring me?

307
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
Because we're being hunted, Alice.

308
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,960
Is this rabid obsession
with your family

309
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,120
really worth it
if we both end up dead?

310
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,120
I suppose it is.

311
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,840
Well, not for me, it's not.

312
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,200
It's over, Alice. I'm leaving.

313
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,920
And where do you imagine going?

314
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,920
Where we've always planned to go.

315
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,680
To the beautiful garden
among the bright flowerbeds

316
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,320
and the cool fountains.

317
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
You,...

318
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,040
out in the world?

319
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,880
Alone?

320
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,480
How would you even survive?

321
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,640
The same way I survived
in Arkham for five years

322
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
without you visiting me once.

323
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,240
Not on my birthday, or a holiday,
or even just because.

324
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,440
You really think
I can't survive without you?

325
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,960
Alice, between the two of us,
I'm not the one I'm worried about.

326
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,440
You can't leave me all alone.

327
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,560
Then don't make me.

328
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,560
Forget all this.

329
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,320
Come with me.

330
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:09,120
I would never let you leave me,
my little Mouse.

331
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,080
But we must leave Gotham
the right way.

332
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,680
With a party.

333
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,400
Every season Titan underwent
a mandatory brain scan

334
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,240
to assess his eligibility to play.

335
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,200
And Gotham U claimed this...

336
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,480
was his most recent brain scan.

337
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,320
Totally healthy.

338
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,840
But after digging deep
into the neuro clinic records,

339
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,080
thanks to Mary's
med school connections.

340
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,360
Technically,
it's not a HIPAA violation

341
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,960
if you're not a real doctor.

342
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,480
Turns out this...

343
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,880
was his actual brain scan.

344
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,480
Oh, God. All those years
of head trauma.

345
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,680
Dorsal posterior insula's
basically shriveled to nothing.

346
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,840
That sounds really bad.

347
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,160
It's the part of the brain
that governs pain.

348
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,040
No wonder he didn't feel
that Batarang.

349
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,240
They cover it all up
and they give you

350
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,160
a big, fat, championship ring
for your troubles.

351
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,840
Wow. Interesting.

352
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,240
GU's coach, Donahue,

353
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,160
took an early retirement
right before the scandal broke.

354
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,800
All right.
He might be Titan's next victim.

355
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Where are you going?

356
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,800
You can barely stand,
much less take on a literal goliath

357
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,360
who's hella impervious to pain.

358
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,880
Yeah. Not to mention,
the Crows would love

359
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,800
to put your pointy-eared head
on a pike.

360
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,800
And what do you expect me to do, hm?
Stand down?

361
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,040
Just let Titan
rampage through Gotham?

362
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,240
Well...

363
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,360
there is another idea.

364
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,560
But I don't think
you're gonna like it.

365
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,960
Go, go, go!

366
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,680
If you see the Bat, shoot.

367
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,640
Got something behind the light.

368
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,800
Don't shoot!

369
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,120
I'm here on behalf of Batwoman.

370
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,080
Where is she?

371
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,640
Dad, I'm fine!

372
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,360
Everything's okay.

373
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,320
What's going on?
How the hell did she get to you?

374
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,040
Can you just please talk to her?

375
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,560
You just made this way too personal.

376
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,920
- <i>We need to talk about Titan.</i>
- Which part?

377
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,720
About how he doesn't play
by the rules

378
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,720
or care about collateral damage?

379
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:47,120
<i>I want to team up.
We can take him on together.</i>

380
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,480
What's the matter?
Titan too much for your army of one?

381
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,720
<i>Honestly, yeah.</i>

382
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,400
<i>I could use the muscle</i>

383
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,080
<i>and you can use me
because I know how to draw him out.</i>

384
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,560
Oh, like you drew me out
by using my own daughter?

385
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,840
What sort of wannabe hero

386
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,560
puts an innocent girl
in front of a firing squad?

387
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,120
Could have blown her damn head off!

388
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,360
Everyone off the roof now!

389
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,640
You heard him. Go. Go.

390
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,720
How the hell did she find you?

391
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,160
- She didn't! I found her.
- What are you talking about?

392
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,520
I'm saying this was my idea!

393
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,120
You told me that the Crows
wanted to make over their image.

394
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,120
Why not start by allying yourself

395
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,520
with someone
this city actually roots for?

396
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,760
You did this?

397
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,240
I knew I'm one of the only people
who can get through to you!

398
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,320
I believe in her, Dad.

399
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,000
Mary, I said anyone affiliated
with her will be brought to justice.

400
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,520
Okay, then arrest me.

401
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,800
Arrest me for believing in someone
who saves lives

402
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,800
and who stops criminals
and who inspires hope

403
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,720
without charging a penny for it!

404
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,200
I'm your daughter and if I don't
believe in what you're doing,

405
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,520
how can you expect
a city of strangers to?

406
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,320
Except the person you believe in

407
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,720
doesn't even have the guts
to show her face.

408
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,840
I can't show you my face,
but I can offer you this.

409
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
A truce.

410
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,120
We partner up,
protect the city together.

411
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,680
Please.

412
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,440
So, how do we get him?

413
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm at Gotham City Arena

414
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,760
with Gotham University's
former head coach Kurt Donahue.

415
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,120
Kurt, what are your thoughts?

416
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,600
If you're listening, Titan,

417
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,000
I'm sorry for thinking the sport
was bigger than the human life.

418
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,120
And I hope you'll come
join me on the 50-yard line

419
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,920
where I can apologize
to you in person.

420
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,280
It's called a trauma bond exercise.

421
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,560
I just write the thing
that anchors us

422
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,520
to our pain
so that we can move on.

423
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,240
Look who paid attention
in group therapy.

424
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,080
Maybe a little.

425
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,840
This book is our chain.

426
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
It locks us to the Caterpillar,...

427
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,640
the Queen...

428
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,640
that basement cell.

429
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,640
It binds us to every terrible...

430
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,200
twisted thing
we were forced to endure.

431
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,520
Burning it breaks our attachment

432
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,000
and frees us to move on...

433
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,960
which we always intended to do.

434
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,640
Move on.

435
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,840
What happened to us...

436
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,040
should never happen to anyone.

437
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,360
But there's no one in the world

438
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,640
I would have rather
gone through it with than you.

439
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,560
Nor I without you.

440
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,800
And I mean this with all of my heart.

441
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,400
I still wanna join you
in the beautiful garden...

442
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,720
and smell the seasons
in bright flowerbeds

443
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,240
and make a wish in cool fountains.

444
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,240
I wanna meet a man with many hats.

445
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,240
And smile back at the Cheshire cat.

446
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,520
And run with you forever...

447
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,800
through our Wonderland.

448
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
Alice...

449
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,160
No!

450
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,680
What did you do?

451
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,960
You made me choose.

452
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,920
You poisoned me?

453
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,800
Why did you do that?

454
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,840
Because I couldn't let you leave me.

455
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,280
Not you too.

456
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,800
This...

457
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,160
This wasn't even real?

458
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,400
If only pain could turn to ash
with the strike of a match.

459
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,760
But my pain is a part of me,
the way my family is a part of me.

460
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,200
You could never understand
why I need to enact my revenge,

461
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,080
because you've never experienced
true betrayal.

462
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
At least not until now.

463
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,880
Goodbye, my sweet Mouse.

464
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,880
My brother...

465
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,840
my everything.

466
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,200
I'll see you again in Wonderland.

467
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,400
Are we missing the company party
or something?

468
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,480
Where's the commander?

469
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,760
It's all hands on deck
at the arena with Batwoman.

470
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,560
- What did you mean "With Batwoman"?
- They teamed up to bring down Titan.

471
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,520
Two hours ago he said he would arrest
anyone affiliated with her.

472
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,400
Now he's tagging her into the ring?

473
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,520
Something's up.

474
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,120
We need to get there.

475
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,440
Call her and give her the heads-up.

476
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,120
Saying what, exactly?

477
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,840
To watch her six.

478
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,640
<i>It's the smoke laying low</i>

479
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,320
<i>Before the flame shows</i>

480
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,280
<i>It's the far away light</i>

481
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,360
<i>In the quiet in the night</i>

482
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,200
I don't think this guy is gonna show.

483
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,920
Could that have anything to do
with the Crows lying in wait?

484
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm not standing down the welcoming
committee, leave tactical to me.

485
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,800
<i>So choose your weapons wise</i>

486
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,080
Uh, Batcave to Batwoman,
Julia just texted...

487
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,720
- Yeah, I got it too. I'll be fine.
- Julia seems to think otherwise.

488
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,760
Julia didn't look into my dad's eyes
when she shook his hand, okay?

489
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,080
I'll be fine...

490
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,840
ish.

491
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,920
What just happened?

492
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,360
Someone cut the power.

493
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,080
Why are we in the dark?

494
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,240
<i>Not sure, commander.
Working on it now.</i>

495
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,280
<i>Under attack</i>

496
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,920
All positions report in.

497
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,360
<i>Section 30, clear.</i>

498
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,200
<i>Box level, clear.</i>

499
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,320
- <i>End zone one...</i>
- It's him.

500
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,280
Go!

501
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,760
Stop!

502
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,920
Tim, this isn't you!

503
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,040
Apollo told me who you are.

504
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,240
Big brother,

505
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,240
used to walk the neighborhood kids
to the bus stop.

506
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,600
Make sure they were safe.

507
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,080
I know that person
is still inside you.

508
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,680
I didn't wanna be this.

509
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,920
I know.

510
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,160
You didn't have to kill him!

511
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,360
What are you doing?

512
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,960
I promised you war.
This is what it looks like.

513
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,760
We're on the same team.

514
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,720
You can't do this.

515
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,400
We're on the same team...

516
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,400
Stop! What are you doing?

517
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,560
Is that why you sidelined me today?

518
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,400
If you want to take me off the field
to launch this app, fine.

519
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,800
But if you're using it to distract me
while you and everyone else

520
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,040
are trying to take out Batwoman...

521
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,960
And why would I need to do that,
Agent Moore?

522
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,400
Because you would've gone
behind your own team's back

523
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,560
to protect a criminal?

524
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,720
I'm protecting you from being
on the wrong side of this.

525
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,240
What is it about her?

526
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,960
You, now Mary,
tell me what I'm missing.

527
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,840
With all due respect, sir, hope.

528
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,160
If it weren't for her, my wife's
killer would still be in Arkham.

529
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,000
Hope is a luxury I don't have.

530
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,680
Thought you two used to be tight.

531
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,600
We are.

532
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,120
At least...

533
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,120
we were.

534
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,160
I thought you called Batwoman
to warn her.

535
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,880
I did. She didn't listen.

536
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,400
You don't believe me.

537
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,760
I don't know.

538
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,120
Maybe I'm just looking for flaws

539
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,040
because I'm terrified of being
in a relationship with a woman.

540
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,160
No. I'm pretty much being shady
by design, love.

541
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,080
Okay.

542
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,560
So, in one of my many thrilling
and sexy adventures,

543
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,040
I met the wrong person
and proceeded to betray her.

544
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,120
So, you're hiding? From who?

545
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Her name is Safiyah
and I'll say no more

546
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,560
because I'll only pull you into it.

547
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,800
A sexy and thrilling adventure?

548
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,240
Maybe I want to be pulled in.

549
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,760
I wish it were that simple, love.

550
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,600
I knew I had a target on my back,

551
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,840
I just didn't know its circumference.

552
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,560
These were left
at my hotel this morning.

553
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,800
Do you need this?

554
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,440
My thoughts exactly.

555
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,400
I actually pictured myself coming out
to him as Batwoman one day.

556
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,000
I looked him in the eyes
and I believed him.

557
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,120
I'm really, really sorry, Kate.

558
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,120
If it means anything to you,
I believed him too.

559
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,880
I always thought
when I put that suit on

560
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,560
that nothing could hurt me.

561
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,200
But I was wrong.

562
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,920
His betrayal hurt a million times
more than any of those bullets.

563
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,400
- My dad hates me.
- No. Batwoman.

564
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,920
He hates Batwoman. You, he loves.

565
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,680
He once loved Beth too.

566
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,600
In his mind,
Batwoman is just as crazy as Alice.

567
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,720
He's wrong.

568
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,560
Thank you for having my back today.

569
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,120
To sisters.

570
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,000
To sisters.

571
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,320
Am I interrupting?

572
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,320
Come in.

573
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,480
May I present to you...

574
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,320
I'll stick with booze. Thanks.

575
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,120
What... No, that's not...
That's kryptonite.

576
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,800
I figured out how to destroy it.

577
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,080
Oh, my God.

578
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,120
You used a hammer.

579
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,920
Okay, more like 40,000 tons
of compressive force.

580
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,520
Wayne has access
to a hydraulic press.

581
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,800
So just a really expensive hammer.

582
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,480
Yeah, Mary. This is all thanks
to your brilliant hammer idea.

583
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,560
Point being, this is what's left
of the only thing on Earth

584
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,200
that can penetrate the Batsuit.

585
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Okay.

586
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,040
And that is me taking the only weapon
that can kill you off the table.

587
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,520
Before we get too cocky...

588
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,160
No more secrets.

589
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,240
Not between us.

590
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,480
And not after today.

591
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,440
- Where did you get that?
- The same way Bruce did.

592
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,920
A friend gave it to me
for safekeeping

593
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,320
in case she ever lost her way.

594
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,480
And you're just telling us
about it now because...

595
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,640
I honestly didn't think
you'd figure out a way to destroy it.

596
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,960
Well, we did. So hand it over.

597
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,400
And because I can't.

598
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,640
It's not mine to destroy.

599
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,760
Kate, if that gets into
the wrong hands, it'll kill you.

600
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,520
I promised my friend I would keep it.

601
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,360
And she trusts me.

602
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,440
And until I can talk to her about it,

603
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,560
I need you guys to trust me too.

604
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,120
Come.

605
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,720
Sir, thought
these might interest you.

606
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,200
Collected them from the arena.

607
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,440
That in particular
is a slug from a Desert Eagle.

608
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,040
Desert Eagle
can shoot through anything.

609
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,800
Well, almost anything, sir.

610
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,440
Then we're going to need
to find something stronger.

611
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,600
I must admit, Tommy,

612
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,720
I find you to be one of the most
loathsome men in Gotham.

613
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,080
Vain and uncouth.

614
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,400
Humorless and dull.

615
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,800
I pity any woman who confuses

616
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,600
the buzz of her martini
with your charms.

617
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,320
And yet, here you are.

618
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,000
My masterpiece.

619
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,680
What did you do?

620
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,080
I made all your dreams come true.

621
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,240
I look like Bruce Wayne.

622
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,840
You made me Bruce Wayne.

623
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:22,040
So, my rich, handsome,

624
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,600
beloved Bruce,

625
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,320
I need you to strut through the doors
of Wayne Tower

626
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,480
and get me that shard of kryptonite
from your dear cousin Kate.
