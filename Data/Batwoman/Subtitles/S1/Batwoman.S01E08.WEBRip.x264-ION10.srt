1
00:00:01,094 --> 00:00:02,784
Previously on "Batwoman"...

2
00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:06,143
Bruce never stopped looking
for your sister's body.

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:09,015
Catherine Hamilton's investigators found

4
00:00:09,016 --> 00:00:11,051
skull fragments of a little girl.

5
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,886
It's Beth.

6
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,755
You never would have moved on

7
00:00:14,756 --> 00:00:17,124
if you didn't think that Beth were dead.

8
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:20,127
I paid the DNA analyst
to write the report.

9
00:00:20,128 --> 00:00:22,629
As hard as I have tried
to get over you, I can't.

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,431
It's definitely not fair to Tyler.

11
00:00:24,432 --> 00:00:26,867
Maybe it's best if I keep
my distance from now on.

12
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:28,100
Daddy!

13
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:34,307
Catherine seems to think so.

14
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:35,909
We are to host

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,980
the most memorable mad tea-party

16
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:43,250
Gotham has ever seen.

17
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,550
Ha ha ha!

18
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:50,223
They say the choices we make define us,

19
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:53,160
but despite all the darkness,
despite all those who doubt,

20
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:56,129
and despite my own fear that
I've lost my sister forever,

21
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,633
I choose to hope that
Beth is still there.

22
00:00:59,634 --> 00:01:03,069
Don't tell anyone, Bruce, but I
think this makes me an optimist.

23
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:17,416
- Give me your jacket!
- Wait. What?

24
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:20,654
Unh! Give me your jacket.

25
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:22,789
This is vintage, bitch.

26
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,158
Hyah!

27
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,828
Okay. Take it, take
it, take it, take it.

00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:47,547
- Vintage.
- Thanks.

31
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:50,016
Not exactly my style or size.

32
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:51,852
Ooh. Is that blood? You
really shouldn't have.

33
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:53,520
Front right pocket.
Rabbit dropped it in there

34
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,712
before he made a run for it.

35
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:56,838
Think we can use the
phone's GPS to track Alice?

36
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:58,339
- I can try.
- Cool.

37
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:05,298
I see you broke the staff in two.

38
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:06,867
Like I wouldn't notice?

39
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:08,869
Sorry. For the record,
it'd be a whole lot cooler

40
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,203
if it actually came apart.

41
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:13,173
It doesn't, though, so...

42
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,676
Okay. Here is every location the
phone's gone to the past 7 days.

43
00:02:16,677 --> 00:02:18,678
Where's this?

44
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:21,815
Ah. Slice of Gotham. Worst
breadsticks in the city,

45
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:24,308
but location two is a
little more promising.

46
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:26,253
It's a warehouse in The Bowery.

47
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:28,221
Then that's where she is.

48
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:29,488
Don't wait up.

49
00:02:37,864 --> 00:02:41,878
Ohh! Too sad, too loud, too mundane!

50
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,172
Whaa! Why do I have nothing to wear?

51
00:02:46,173 --> 00:02:49,543
Ugh. If you're going to kidnap me again,

52
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:53,246
do wait until I can dolly
up into something with, um,

53
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:54,948
a little more flair.

54
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,683
Did you hire The Rifle to kill me?

55
00:02:56,684 --> 00:02:59,553
Says the walking, talking, living girl.

56
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,788
He shot someone that he
believed to be Batwoman

57
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,147
with the coil accelerator,

58
00:03:03,148 --> 00:03:05,225
a weapon designed for only one reason...

59
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,360
To kill me.

60
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,062
The guy who designed it was found

61
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,864
with a butterfly knife in his heart.

62
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:12,766
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Let me rephrase that.

63
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:17,537
So an evil man was trying
to kill my twin sister,

64
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:21,440
and I ensured that that didn't happen.

65
00:03:23,877 --> 00:03:25,010
What is this?

66
00:03:25,011 --> 00:03:27,615
Uh, that is a multimillion-dollar
piece of technology

67
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,383
that allows the coil accelerator
to penetrate your suit.

68
00:03:30,384 --> 00:03:32,648
That's the only one that
exists on the planet.

69
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:34,454
Anyone who knew how to make it is,

70
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:37,724
well, um, exactly that, past tense,

71
00:03:37,725 --> 00:03:40,660
so... you're welcome.

72
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,063
Turn yourself in, Alice.

73
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:45,665
Let me help you.

74
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,501
I know my sister is in there.

75
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:49,836
Oh, this again.

76
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:51,503
You kept this...

77
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:55,608
From the day of our bat mitzvahs.

78
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,915
Take it and be gone.

79
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:06,185
I am quite busy, and
I have nothing to wear.

80
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:24,170
It's Kane. I'll be back
in Gotham later tonight.

81
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:27,031
We'll go over the floor plan for
the gala first thing tomorrow.

82
00:04:27,032 --> 00:04:28,474
Talk then.

83
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:06,246
So the way I see it you can either spend

84
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:10,350
your Friday night in
here inhaling asbestos,

85
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,687
or you could join me
in wearing this season's

86
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,056
sexiest haute couture, hmm?

87
00:05:16,057 --> 00:05:20,926
Seriously, Gigi and Bella could not
even get their hands on this yet.

88
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:24,564
You want me to go to that thing tonight.

89
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:27,340
That thing is the
Gotham Humanitarian Gala,

90
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:29,703
i.e. the most important
event of the season.

91
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,906
Honoring your mom, who told
my dad that Beth was dead.

92
00:05:32,907 --> 00:05:34,607
Asbestos it is.

93
00:05:34,608 --> 00:05:37,277
I get that we are bordering on too soon.

94
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:39,403
Hmm. Pretty sure we're
right in the middle of it.

95
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:41,074
I know that this isn't important to you,

96
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,916
but it's important to me, okay,

97
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:45,185
so why can't it be important to
you that it's important to me?

98
00:05:45,186 --> 00:05:47,721
Because you think that if
Gotham sees us as a family

99
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,046
that we'll start to believe it,

100
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:50,590
and that's just not how it works,

101
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:51,916
not after what Catherine did.

102
00:05:51,917 --> 00:05:53,393
But you gave Alice a second chance

103
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,361
and a third and a fourth.

104
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:57,564
How can you just write
off my mom as Satan

105
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,390
but you don't seem to have any problem

106
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:02,402
holding out hope for the actual
most evil person in Gotham?

107
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,205
Because she's my family.

108
00:06:05,206 --> 00:06:09,776
And I'm not? Got it.

109
00:06:09,777 --> 00:06:12,412
I guess I am the crazy one, you know,

110
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,615
for thinking that you and
I could still be sisters.

111
00:06:15,616 --> 00:06:17,317
Of course you're my family.

112
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:19,119
It's just...

113
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,222
Different? Yeah. Do yourself
a favor. Stop digging.

114
00:06:22,223 --> 00:06:24,591
Listen. Even if I wanted to go,

115
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,760
I could never do that to my dad.

116
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:30,563
You don't know? He
decided to come tonight...

117
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,632
For me.

118
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:35,100
Sorry for thinking that
you would do the same.

119
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,782
You're going to the Humanitarian Gala?

120
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:51,151
Yeah. I meant to talk to you about that.

121
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:53,399
Unless Catherine somehow
didn't fake Beth's death,

122
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,321
then I don't know what
there is to talk about.

123
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:57,023
Hmm.

124
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:59,073
- Are you getting back with her?
- Hmm.

125
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:01,527
When you've been with someone
for a decade and a half,

126
00:07:01,528 --> 00:07:03,053
you don't just walk away.

127
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:04,979
You're letting her weasel
her way back into your life.

128
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,039
There's no weaseling, Kate.

129
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,103
We've been spending some time together.

130
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:11,095
When? You've been out of town.

131
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:13,488
Oh. You know, we had
breakfast when I got back.

132
00:07:13,489 --> 00:07:15,448
You're seriously forgiving her?

133
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,611
I'm not defending what
Catherine did. She's not either,

134
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,847
but I'm beginning to
understand why she did it

135
00:07:20,848 --> 00:07:22,549
as a mother,

136
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,017
as a wife.

137
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:26,986
She thought she was helping us move on.

138
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:39,632
Wake up, father dear.

139
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:43,648
Hmm. Why, what a long sleep you've had.

140
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,742
I thought it was high time you and I

141
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:52,544
finally had a daddy-daughter chat.

142
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:57,584
- That's all I want.
- Hmm.

143
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:00,612
Oh, come on. Not like this.

144
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,556
- Let me out of these chains.
- Shh.

145
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:06,926
You're not the commander here...

146
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:08,695
Commander.

147
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,497
Kate will know I'm gone.

148
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:13,733
Will she? Hmm.

149
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,268
Because I saw her last night,

150
00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:17,937
and there was nary a mention of you.

151
00:08:17,938 --> 00:08:22,876
Guess she's 0 for 2 in
missing family members.

152
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:27,714
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

153
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,774
There is no word to
describe what it feels like

154
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:33,253
to know that I left you behind.

155
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:36,856
Then find the words to explain

156
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:41,394
why you never tested the skull
fragments Catherine found.

157
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,230
I had no reason to
think that she was lying.

158
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:47,867
But your daughter was missing,

159
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:51,304
and this was just a handful of bones

160
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:56,042
found by some woman you'd
known for less than a year.

161
00:08:56,043 --> 00:08:58,611
Maybe believing that you were dead

162
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:02,815
was easier than waking
up every morning with hope

163
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:06,151
or going to sleep every
night with a broken heart.

164
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,458
Of course, I should have looked longer.

165
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:15,588
I should have hoped harder,
I should have... I should have

166
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:18,131
had the DNA tested myself.

167
00:09:18,132 --> 00:09:22,035
I wish... I wish I could
have been your father

168
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:25,838
for the past 15 years, but...

169
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,741
I failed.

170
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,442
I failed you.

171
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,981
Thank you for saying that.

172
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:44,257
And thank you

173
00:09:44,258 --> 00:09:48,628
for making me who I am today.

174
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,997
What are you planning?

175
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:55,301
Tell me what to do to stop it.

176
00:09:55,302 --> 00:10:01,174
Today is the day of my mad tea-party

177
00:10:01,175 --> 00:10:04,711
to which you've been invited.

178
00:10:04,712 --> 00:10:09,716
Hmm. I'm fairly certain you'll attend.

179
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:13,653
Catherine will be delighted,

180
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,790
but how can that be if you're stuck here

181
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:21,728
and still the guest of honor?

182
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:26,232
I guess you'll see as we drink tea

183
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:29,402
and someone ends up

184
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:30,836
a goner.

185
00:10:47,804 --> 00:10:49,701
Catherine manipulated
my dad 15 years ago,

186
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:51,737
and here she is just doing it again.

187
00:10:52,978 --> 00:10:54,702
My dad is the head of The Crows.

188
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:56,328
I mean, how is he even falling for this?

189
00:10:56,329 --> 00:10:57,979
Alice has been on a killing
spree since you got back,

190
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,827
and this is what's got you
drinking Bruce's good stuff?

191
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:01,375
Alice was brainwashed
against her own will.

192
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:02,730
This is different. My dad is choosing.

193
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:05,004
He is choosing to
forgive a woman who lied

194
00:11:05,005 --> 00:11:06,286
about the death of his daughter.

195
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:09,156
Catherine paid a team of scientists

196
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:11,285
to change DNA results.

197
00:11:11,286 --> 00:11:13,840
My dad once found a joint in my backpack

198
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,275
and grounded me for a whole summer.

199
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:18,512
It doesn't make sense. This is not him.

200
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:21,713
- This isn't him.
- What am I missing?

201
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:28,343
If you're calling with a
lecture, I don't have time.

202
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:29,568
The opposite actually.

203
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:31,557
I know complicated
better than anyone else,

204
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:35,018
and if you want to work things
out with she who must not be named,

205
00:11:35,019 --> 00:11:36,677
it's not my business.

206
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:38,300
Well, I appreciate that, kiddo.

207
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:40,326
And in thinking about it, I realized

208
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:42,585
that I never really
gave her a chance. Heh.

209
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:44,826
Remember the wedding
and the big snowstorm

210
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:48,063
and I just kept wishing that
maybe if we got snowed in

211
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:49,708
you wouldn't have to get married?

212
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,976
If only a snowstorm
were our biggest hurdle.

213
00:11:54,703 --> 00:11:58,573
Anyway, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry and have fun tonight.

214
00:11:58,574 --> 00:12:00,074
Thanks, Kate.

215
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:04,045
My dad married Catherine on
the hottest day of the year.

216
00:12:04,046 --> 00:12:07,248
- So if that's not your dad, then...
- It's Mouse.

217
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:09,684
So you know those
vacation days we banked?

218
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:12,187
What if we took one of
our old-school road trips?

219
00:12:12,188 --> 00:12:16,358
I was thinking down
south, maybe Dollywood.

220
00:12:16,359 --> 00:12:17,692
Sounds cool.

221
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,527
What is up with you?

222
00:12:19,528 --> 00:12:22,063
I just suggested a
road trip to Dollywood.

223
00:12:22,064 --> 00:12:23,932
Nothing's up with me.

224
00:12:23,933 --> 00:12:25,903
Nothing, or you're pretending to be cool

225
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:28,805
about Kate and me and you're
obviously still freaked?

226
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,936
Ty, if this is going to be a thing,

227
00:12:33,937 --> 00:12:35,276
we should talk about it.

228
00:12:36,968 --> 00:12:38,968
_

229
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,075
Sorry to keep you waiting.

230
00:12:44,076 --> 00:12:47,245
I wanted to go over tonight's agenda.

231
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:49,881
As you know, this is one of
the city's biggest nights,

232
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:52,417
so I need you two to run point.

233
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:53,918
Sophie, you take the Alpha team

234
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,311
and cover the interior.

235
00:12:55,312 --> 00:12:58,223
Tyler, you're with Bravo
locking up the perimeter.

236
00:12:58,224 --> 00:13:00,309
Teams are already down in the theater

237
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,527
- beginning their sweep.
- _

238
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:05,330
I want this evening to
go off without a hitch.

239
00:13:12,337 --> 00:13:15,173
Good evening, Gotham.
Tonight is the city's

240
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:17,742
Humanitarian Gala, which is rich person

241
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:20,133
for "let's dress up and
congratulate each other

242
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:21,613
on being rich and dressed up",

243
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:23,847
and it's all to honor Hamilton Dynamics'

244
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:27,352
matriarch of munitions
Catherine Hamilton-Kane.

245
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:31,189
Not sure how they're gonna fit a
Tomahawk missile into a swag bag.

246
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,425
So I'm en route to the
Humanitarian Gala with the rents.

247
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:36,861
What uuup?!

248
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:38,863
Where Mom is being honored

249
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:41,599
as the Gotham giver of
the year... #prouddaughter.

250
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,934
I just wanted to take a moment and say

251
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:44,493
how thankful I am for family

252
00:13:44,494 --> 00:13:46,905
and for sticking by each
other through thick and thin.

253
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:48,540
That's what it's all about.

254
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:52,109
To Catherine, a most
extraordinary woman.

255
00:13:55,713 --> 00:13:57,815
Cheers.

256
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:09,827
Ugh.

257
00:14:09,828 --> 00:14:11,930
Must be time to move. Ha ha!

258
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:14,065
You are becoming incessant.

259
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,301
And you are becoming predictable.

260
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,936
Whatever you have planned for the gala,

261
00:14:17,937 --> 00:14:19,470
The Crows are already on to it.

262
00:14:19,471 --> 00:14:20,829
Tell me where Dad is.

263
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,474
Or what? You'll have me arrested,

264
00:14:23,475 --> 00:14:26,477
institutionalized, killed?

265
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:29,013
You hate him. I get it. I would, too,

266
00:14:29,014 --> 00:14:31,182
but he did not mean to hurt you.

267
00:14:31,183 --> 00:14:34,085
You keep holding on so tightly

268
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:39,290
to the childish notion
that Beth is still in here.

269
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,860
If Beth is gone, then
why did you keep this?

270
00:14:42,861 --> 00:14:45,049
You saved this for the
same reason you saved me

271
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,265
from The Rifle.

272
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:51,102
Because despite the hate,
the resentment, the rage,

273
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:54,973
there's still good, there's still Beth.

274
00:14:54,974 --> 00:14:59,043
So tell me where Dad is.

275
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:03,514
I left him in the same place he left me.

276
00:15:03,515 --> 00:15:06,284
Thank you.

277
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:08,353
Kate.

278
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:09,721
He's not doing so well.

279
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:11,622
You might want to be quick about it.

280
00:15:18,563 --> 00:15:19,896
Dad?

281
00:15:34,358 --> 00:15:35,625
Hi.

282
00:15:39,964 --> 00:15:41,565
Good evening.

283
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,435
I assume you have everything in order.

284
00:15:44,436 --> 00:15:46,903
10-4, Commander. All good here.

285
00:15:52,977 --> 00:15:54,412
Got to hand it to you, Mouse.

286
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,713
That's impressive.

287
00:15:55,714 --> 00:15:57,581
If you're not Jacob,

288
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:01,252
then you're...

289
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,621
Not a Crow. Oh, crap.

290
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,657
To date, the Hamilton Foundation

291
00:16:06,658 --> 00:16:08,967
has donated countless millions

292
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,828
to fund work in the health,

293
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:14,572
emergency relief, poverty,
and education sectors

294
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,101
both globally and in Gotham.

295
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,769
All of these philanthropic efforts

296
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,333
are spearheaded by Catherine herself.

297
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:23,669
I can think of on one more deserving

298
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:27,373
of the Gotham humanitarian
of the year award

299
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,442
than Catherine Hamilton-Kane.

300
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:31,177
Whoo! Ha ha!

301
00:16:36,749 --> 00:16:38,083
Whoo!

302
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,889
Thank you, Dr. Campbell,
for that wonderful intro

303
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,592
and to Mayor Akins
and the city of Gotham

304
00:16:46,593 --> 00:16:50,196
for this great honor.

305
00:16:50,197 --> 00:16:52,864
When I took over this
company from my father...

306
00:16:56,602 --> 00:16:59,138
Tyler. Tyler!

307
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:01,941
Wake up!

308
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:03,442
What happened?

309
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:05,478
The commander tranqed us.

310
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,747
What?

311
00:17:07,748 --> 00:17:10,149
Help! We're in here!

312
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,084
One-way windows, soundproof walls.

313
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:14,954
No one can hear us or see us.

314
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:17,276
Kate was right. Alice's new minion

315
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:19,158
is impersonating Jacob Kane.

316
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:21,227
I'm still way too drugged
up to process that.

317
00:17:21,228 --> 00:17:23,395
Alice must be planning
something at the gala,

318
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:24,797
which is why she took us out.

319
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:26,966
I thought Alice was more of a...

320
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:30,669
Slit open our necks and pose
for a tea-party type murderer.

321
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,171
Ketamine's a little dull, no?

322
00:17:32,172 --> 00:17:33,672
She didn't want to hurt us.

323
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:35,608
We're talking about
the same Alice, right?

324
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:37,643
She's trying to preserve
some sick relationship

325
00:17:37,644 --> 00:17:40,145
with Kate, and killing me would...

326
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:45,317
Killing you would mean
Kate would never forgive her

327
00:17:45,318 --> 00:17:48,754
because Kate's still in love with you.

328
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:51,991
I have no idea.

329
00:17:51,992 --> 00:17:54,592
And what about you?
Any idea how you feel?

330
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,610
We should probably figure
out how to get out of here.

331
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:05,004
Today, Hamilton is a household name

332
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:06,704
in technology innovation.

333
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,821
_

334
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:19,871
_

335
00:18:29,634 --> 00:18:30,926
She's fine.

336
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:33,061
"Tonight...

337
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:37,570
You honor me as one of Gotham's heroes,

338
00:18:37,571 --> 00:18:40,906
an honor that I...

339
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:43,042
bought and paid for"...

340
00:18:45,078 --> 00:18:48,480
"Quite literally with... blood money.

341
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:51,884
My company makes millions
by putting weapons of war

342
00:18:51,885 --> 00:18:54,219
in the hands of Gotham's criminals"...

343
00:18:56,355 --> 00:18:58,189
"And my husband...

344
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:02,394
rakes in even more by
protecting you from them".

345
00:19:02,395 --> 00:19:03,553
Dad.

346
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:05,598
"Quite the scam we've been running,

347
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,233
wouldn't you say?"

348
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:18,377
"What my husband
doesn't want you to know

349
00:19:18,378 --> 00:19:20,746
is that the true villains
of Gotham don't go

350
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:23,415
by the name Joker,

351
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,951
Riddler, or Alice".

352
00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:31,389
"Gotham's true enemies
are right in front of you".

353
00:19:37,296 --> 00:19:41,195
I... I... I...

354
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:45,104
Mom!

355
00:19:45,105 --> 00:19:46,971
Mom, Mom, Mom!

356
00:19:52,726 --> 00:19:54,094
Orpheum Theater. We need medics.

357
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,713
You hang in there,
sweetheart. You're okay.

358
00:19:56,714 --> 00:19:59,106
Hello? Something's happened to my mom.

359
00:19:59,107 --> 00:20:01,523
She's breathing, but we need
medical help immediately.

360
00:20:01,524 --> 00:20:03,925
You keep an eye over
them until I get back.

361
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:05,960
Oh, my God. Where are you going?

362
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:07,796
I'm gonna meet the medical
help and bring them here.

363
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:10,932
- Okay. All right. Okay.
- Hang in there, sweetheart.

364
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:13,201
Oh, my God.

365
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:17,572
I didn't have a choice.

366
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:19,908
It's okay.

367
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:21,810
She made me.

368
00:20:21,811 --> 00:20:25,046
Stay with me. Help is on the way.

369
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:27,382
Ladies and gentlemen, as we get medics

370
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:31,286
for Mrs. Hamilton-Kane,
please stay in your seats.

371
00:20:31,287 --> 00:20:34,622
There's no cause for alarm. Please.

372
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:36,991
Everything's under control.

373
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:38,029
Stay in your seats.

374
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,328
There's no need to panic.

375
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:42,897
The Crows are holding us!

376
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:44,765
Let us out!

377
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:47,802
Okay. I'm in position.

378
00:20:47,803 --> 00:20:49,469
Batwoman's here. Let's bounce!

379
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,942
Rrrraaahh!

380
00:21:13,628 --> 00:21:14,995
Aah!

381
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:28,209
A little left.

382
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,879
Trying. Nope.

383
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,881
Other one.

384
00:21:32,882 --> 00:21:35,683
- Got it.
- Nice.

385
00:21:35,684 --> 00:21:37,412
Yeah. I'm really
regretting not getting you

386
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:39,854
a bigger one of these in this moment.

387
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:41,556
I wouldn't have wanted it.

388
00:21:41,557 --> 00:21:44,058
You sure you still want this one?

389
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:45,217
Tyler.

390
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:46,809
It's a little hard to ignore the irony

391
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,830
of using the engagement
ring I got you to escape

392
00:21:48,831 --> 00:21:51,431
your ex-girlfriend's lunatic sister,

393
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:53,307
who didn't kill us
because she knows more

394
00:21:53,308 --> 00:21:55,303
about your past relationships than I do.

395
00:21:55,304 --> 00:21:56,670
What do you want to know?

396
00:21:58,673 --> 00:22:00,875
What was it between you two?

397
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:03,070
And don't say it was just
some drunk college hookup

398
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,371
unless you were actually
drunk for 3 years.

399
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:18,026
Look.

400
00:22:18,027 --> 00:22:20,261
All my life I followed the rules,

401
00:22:20,262 --> 00:22:23,597
my family's rules, the army's rules.

402
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,480
This was the first time I broke one,

403
00:22:27,481 --> 00:22:30,705
and it almost cost me everything.

404
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:32,072
That's why I lied.

405
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:36,276
Didn't answer my question.

406
00:22:51,926 --> 00:22:53,393
Let's go get some help.

407
00:22:57,729 --> 00:22:59,488
Commissioner, with all due respect,

408
00:22:59,489 --> 00:23:01,089
I need your men to stand down.

409
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,457
She's infiltrated The Crows.

410
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,192
If you breach, we're all dead.

411
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,645
Why isn't Jacob back?

412
00:23:08,646 --> 00:23:09,912
He'll be back soon.

413
00:23:19,508 --> 00:23:22,611
Your husband won't be joining you.

414
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:25,280
Get me the tray.

415
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:28,283
Catherine, you do not look so well.

416
00:23:28,284 --> 00:23:30,986
You stay the hell away from us!

417
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:34,489
I'm not the one you should worry about,

418
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:37,893
for "It was all very
well to say, 'Drink me',"

419
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:40,162
but you should have first looked

420
00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:42,864
to see whether it's
marked poison or not.

421
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh! You poisoned her?

422
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:48,503
Group effort. I used a
Catherine Hamilton recipe,

423
00:23:48,504 --> 00:23:50,163
project 4782.

424
00:23:50,164 --> 00:23:51,707
Ring any bells?

425
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:53,475
4782?

426
00:23:53,476 --> 00:23:57,512
Catherine, do you want to tell her?

427
00:23:57,513 --> 00:24:00,816
I think her internal
organs are liquefying.

428
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:03,685
I'll just tell you.
It's a deadly neurotoxin

429
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:05,776
designed to kill without mercy.

430
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,990
First, there is the dizzy spells

431
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:11,426
and then nosebleeds and
then comes muscle paralysis

432
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:13,595
and, uh, oh, respiratory failure,

433
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:18,033
but lucky for us, Hamilton
developed an antidote.

434
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:21,640
Okay. You just got to hold on
until we can get that antidote.

435
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:24,576
Oh, no, my dear, I'm
confusing my stories.

436
00:24:24,577 --> 00:24:27,913
Hamilton never even bothered
to develop an antidote.

437
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:31,082
If she dies, I'll kill you!

438
00:24:33,151 --> 00:24:37,589
She made a choice.

439
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,193
Maybe if she'd made
better choices in the past,

440
00:24:41,194 --> 00:24:43,228
we wouldn't be here right now.

441
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:45,530
You're just gonna let her die.

442
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:51,281
Aw, Mary, my darling,
impetuous stepsister,

443
00:24:51,282 --> 00:24:53,570
I'm not a total monster.

444
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:57,874
No. I found a solution,

445
00:24:57,875 --> 00:25:02,612
a universal cure-all
all the way from Coriana.

446
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:03,980
Where's Coriana?

447
00:25:03,981 --> 00:25:07,283
Hmm. On a map or two.

448
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:09,218
It's made from a desert rose that blooms

449
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:11,154
only on the island.

450
00:25:11,155 --> 00:25:15,825
One prick of its thorn
can kill you on the spot,

451
00:25:15,826 --> 00:25:19,762
but harness the flower

452
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:22,098
and nurture its serum,

453
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:24,266
and it gives you life.

454
00:25:27,336 --> 00:25:29,071
What do you want?

455
00:25:29,072 --> 00:25:33,775
Hmm. A simple apology...

456
00:25:35,912 --> 00:25:40,516
for all the pain you've caused me.

457
00:25:42,486 --> 00:25:47,156
I'm sorry... Alice.

458
00:25:47,157 --> 00:25:49,424
I just don't believe you.

459
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:08,444
Get me eyes on Alice and Jacob.

460
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:12,982
She said she was sorry!

461
00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:16,152
You think I enjoy watching

462
00:26:16,153 --> 00:26:17,720
a daughter lose her mother?

463
00:26:17,721 --> 00:26:19,555
Gah!

464
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:23,459
I was just inches from my own mother's

465
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,927
severed head floating
down the Gotham river

466
00:26:26,928 --> 00:26:30,198
after our car plummeted off the bridge.

467
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:34,203
Oh, please.

468
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:37,006
Please just try.

469
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:40,242
I can't lose you. Please just try.

470
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,980
I'm a mother.

471
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:49,819
Alice...

472
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,888
When I saw Kate grieving,

473
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:54,323
I saw my own daughter.

474
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:57,893
I just wanted to take away her pain,

475
00:26:57,894 --> 00:27:00,278
but in trying to take away Kate's pain,

476
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,697
I gave you a lifetime of it.

477
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:05,768
It's all my fault, Alice.

478
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:08,437
All the lost years, all
the agony you endured,

479
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:11,774
it's all my fault. It's all...

480
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:14,377
I'm truly sorry.

481
00:27:14,378 --> 00:27:16,611
Thank you, Catherine.

482
00:27:18,447 --> 00:27:21,017
I do believe you've earned
a draught of this tea.

483
00:27:21,018 --> 00:27:24,420
Oh!

484
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:27,290
Oh, dear. Not you, too.

485
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:30,092
What?!

486
00:27:30,093 --> 00:27:34,930
Uhh. No. What did you do? How did you...

487
00:27:34,931 --> 00:27:39,935
Tell me you didn't both
drink the champagne.

488
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:42,071
Oh, that's such a shame,

489
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:45,740
seeing as there's only
enough antidote for one.

490
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,531
Dad drank the champagne, too.

491
00:27:55,532 --> 00:27:56,997
We need to go find him.

492
00:27:56,998 --> 00:27:58,853
He'll be fine. He knows better than

493
00:27:58,854 --> 00:28:00,855
- to poison himself.
- What?

494
00:28:00,856 --> 00:28:02,857
He poisoned you, Mary.

495
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:04,392
Jacob would never hurt us.

496
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,243
Hmm. Getting closer.

497
00:28:06,244 --> 00:28:08,979
You had someone impersonate him.

498
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,747
What?

499
00:28:10,748 --> 00:28:12,416
The Skin Pirate.

500
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,483
There is an escapee from Arkham.

501
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:20,157
That wasn't Jacob in the limo.

502
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:23,193
There you go.

503
00:28:23,194 --> 00:28:25,262
Now what were we talking about?

504
00:28:25,263 --> 00:28:30,167
Yes. The choices we make.

505
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:31,934
Do choose wisely.

506
00:28:39,243 --> 00:28:43,113
Okay. Maybe if we split it,

507
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:45,082
maybe we'll buy enough time

508
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:46,583
to get to the emergency room.

509
00:28:46,584 --> 00:28:48,411
No, no. Alice would
have accounted for that.

510
00:28:48,412 --> 00:28:50,220
No. Mom, we have to try, okay?

511
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:51,555
We have to try.

512
00:28:51,556 --> 00:28:55,225
Mary, listen to me. Drink it.

513
00:28:55,226 --> 00:28:57,561
No. There has to be another way.

514
00:28:57,562 --> 00:29:00,062
Mary, I am your mother.

515
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:03,800
Ugh! Drink it.

516
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:05,268
It's okay.

517
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:09,639
Drink it.

518
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:27,460
Did you do it?

519
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:29,386
Jacob's drugged, and
I put him in the SUV.

520
00:29:29,387 --> 00:29:31,224
- Good.
- He doesn't know what happened.

521
00:29:31,225 --> 00:29:33,459
I have to go.

522
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,230
You're too late.

523
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:38,864
Where is my dad?

524
00:29:42,569 --> 00:29:46,739
Our... dad.

525
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,741
You'll find out soon enough.

526
00:29:48,742 --> 00:29:51,075
Whatever you did, you can undo it.

527
00:29:51,076 --> 00:29:53,246
But I don't want to undo it.

528
00:29:53,247 --> 00:29:56,440
I was locked in a cell

529
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:59,719
for 11 years.

530
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,322
What do you think put
me to sleep at night,

531
00:30:02,323 --> 00:30:07,293
rainbows, unicorns?

532
00:30:07,294 --> 00:30:11,532
I dreamt of revenge.

533
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:12,865
What did you do?

534
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,449
What did you do?!

535
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:21,287
"It was all very well
to say, 'Drink me',

536
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:23,456
but the wise little Alice

537
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:26,258
was not going to do that in a hurry".

538
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:33,466
Oh, come on. It's not like
Catherine didn't have it coming.

539
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:35,188
You poisoned Catherine?

540
00:30:35,189 --> 00:30:37,751
Catherine poisoned Catherine

541
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,707
when she slithered into our family

542
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,642
and brainwashed our father

543
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:46,179
and replaced us with that vapid

544
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:50,282
human run-on sentence of a daughter.

545
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:56,022
Catherine brought this on herself,

546
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:59,792
and I was more than happy to watch

547
00:30:59,793 --> 00:31:01,995
Daddy go down with her. Ha ha ha!

548
00:31:01,996 --> 00:31:03,529
Unh!

549
00:31:13,907 --> 00:31:15,874
Ha ha ha!

550
00:31:22,182 --> 00:31:23,815
That's what I thought.

551
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,859
We need to go.

552
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,927
One way or another, dear sister,

553
00:31:34,928 --> 00:31:36,595
you'll come to see my way.

554
00:31:43,703 --> 00:31:45,872
Hang on, Mom.

555
00:31:45,873 --> 00:31:48,174
They'll be here, they'll
pump your stomach,

556
00:31:48,175 --> 00:31:49,876
they'll find an antidote.

557
00:31:49,877 --> 00:31:52,177
You just got to hang on, okay?

558
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:59,952
I always wanted to see you work

559
00:31:59,953 --> 00:32:02,889
in your clinic.

560
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,458
How did you know about the clinic?

561
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:07,393
I've always known.

562
00:32:07,394 --> 00:32:09,695
How come you never said anything?

563
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:15,301
The fastest way for you
to stop doing something

564
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:19,038
was for me to approve of it.

565
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,307
Oh, my God.

566
00:32:21,308 --> 00:32:24,733
Do you know how many wardrobe
changes I did in that elevator

567
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,480
thinking that I was fooling you?

568
00:32:27,481 --> 00:32:29,715
Cameras in that elevator.

569
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:31,884
Ha ha ha!

570
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:35,421
Mom?

571
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:39,725
Mom. Shh. Yeah.

572
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:46,432
- Mary...
- Yeah?

573
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:49,301
You're the one thing I did right.

574
00:32:52,105 --> 00:32:55,108
Nothing makes me prouder

575
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:56,942
than having raised you.

576
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:02,648
I love...

577
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:04,684
I...

578
00:33:04,685 --> 00:33:06,084
love...

579
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:12,758
Mom? No, no, no, no, no, no.

580
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:16,362
Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom, stay with me.

581
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:18,531
Wake up.

582
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:21,467
Mom! Please!

583
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:22,701
Mom!

584
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:39,434
What is this?

585
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:43,938
Ohh.

586
00:33:47,977 --> 00:33:50,913
- Kate.
- Who is this?

587
00:33:50,914 --> 00:33:53,783
What? It's... it's me, Kate.

588
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:55,718
What did you get me
for my sixth birthday?

589
00:33:55,719 --> 00:33:57,987
- What?
- What was it?

590
00:33:57,988 --> 00:34:00,389
Ohh. It was, um...

591
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,335
It was a bike that was too big for you.

592
00:34:02,336 --> 00:34:04,727
You wrecked it the same
day. What is going on?

593
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:06,508
Alice and Mouse were at the gala.

594
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:22,490
Get out of the car, Commander.

595
00:34:22,491 --> 00:34:25,192
- Dad?
- I'll call you right back.

596
00:34:28,430 --> 00:34:30,331
What's going on, Commissioner?

597
00:34:30,332 --> 00:34:32,332
Hands in the air, Kane.

598
00:34:43,411 --> 00:34:46,081
Commissioner.

599
00:34:46,082 --> 00:34:48,415
Jacob Kane, you're under arrest.

600
00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:52,720
I don't understand. What
are you talking about?

601
00:34:52,721 --> 00:34:54,255
I've never seen that before in my life.

602
00:34:54,256 --> 00:34:55,690
What the hell is happening?

603
00:34:55,691 --> 00:34:56,890
Get your hands off of me!

604
00:34:59,761 --> 00:35:01,689
Gotham is in shock tonight

605
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,140
over the death of Hamilton Dynamics CEO

606
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:05,533
Catherine Hamilton-Kane,

607
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:07,926
allegedly at the hands of her husband

608
00:35:07,927 --> 00:35:10,105
and head of Crows security Jacob Kane.

609
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:12,388
Her death occurred
just after some stunning

610
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:14,840
and very public
admissions by Hamilton-Kane

611
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:18,442
while accepting an award at
Gotham's Humanitarian Gala.

612
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:22,783
Mary?

613
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:28,922
Mary.

614
00:35:35,597 --> 00:35:38,298
Do you know how many horrible
people that I've saved?

615
00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:46,808
Druggies... thugs with face tattoos.

616
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:49,544
Pulled a windshield out of a guy

617
00:35:49,545 --> 00:35:53,481
who stole the car that he totaled.

618
00:35:53,482 --> 00:35:55,283
Walked out of my clinic the next day

619
00:35:55,284 --> 00:35:59,087
like nothing had happened,

620
00:35:59,088 --> 00:36:02,223
but I...

621
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:04,625
I couldn't save her.

622
00:36:06,327 --> 00:36:08,129
I am so sorry, Mary.

623
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:10,398
You know how she died?

624
00:36:10,399 --> 00:36:15,069
Exactly the way that Alice planned it.

625
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:16,570
Slowly...

626
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,341
And in pain...

627
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:26,413
And the only way for her to save herself

628
00:36:26,414 --> 00:36:28,807
was for me to die, and she sure as hell

629
00:36:28,808 --> 00:36:30,518
wasn't about to let that happen

630
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,639
because she is not the horrible person

631
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,324
that you and Alice claim that she is.

632
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:39,194
You...

633
00:36:39,195 --> 00:36:41,492
You are literally the last person

634
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:44,666
who can bring me comfort right now.

635
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:46,434
I'm gonna ask you again, Kate.

636
00:36:46,435 --> 00:36:48,703
Is Alice worth it?

637
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:49,871
No.

638
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:52,207
Finally.

639
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:53,840
Too bad it's too late.

640
00:37:01,549 --> 00:37:04,452
Agent Sophie Moore.

641
00:37:04,453 --> 00:37:06,988
Yeah. It's been a
late night for us, too.

642
00:37:06,989 --> 00:37:08,656
Just put me on with the Commissioner.

643
00:37:08,657 --> 00:37:11,492
He's got the wrong guy.

644
00:37:11,493 --> 00:37:14,229
Because I've got a dart
hole in my neck to prove it.

645
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,693
Please have him call me.

646
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,734
This is insane.

647
00:37:19,735 --> 00:37:22,036
How can they think he actually did this?

648
00:37:22,037 --> 00:37:23,471
People believe what they're told.

649
00:37:23,472 --> 00:37:24,973
It's human nature.

650
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:27,208
Then people are idiots.

651
00:37:27,209 --> 00:37:30,044
- I should call Mary.
- I want kids.

652
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:31,546
What?!

653
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:35,236
And a dog and... family traditions

654
00:37:35,237 --> 00:37:38,419
that we bitch about but do anyways.

655
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,887
Okay.

656
00:37:39,888 --> 00:37:41,380
I don't want to move past this today

657
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:43,091
and then have it come
up again in two years

658
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:45,168
and realize that I'm wasting my life

659
00:37:45,169 --> 00:37:49,163
fighting for something
I can't actually have.

660
00:37:49,164 --> 00:37:51,032
I don't want that either.

661
00:37:51,033 --> 00:37:53,201
Do you love me?

662
00:37:53,202 --> 00:37:54,936
Yes.

663
00:37:54,937 --> 00:37:58,106
Are you in love with me?

664
00:37:58,107 --> 00:38:00,374
Because if you love me, you'll
be real with me right now.

665
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:08,782
I don't know.

666
00:38:18,293 --> 00:38:20,394
Let's not make this
any harder than it is.

667
00:38:24,899 --> 00:38:29,037
I think you need to figure yourself out,

668
00:38:29,038 --> 00:38:30,371
and when you do and if you see

669
00:38:30,372 --> 00:38:33,708
the same future I do,

670
00:38:33,709 --> 00:38:37,078
maybe I'll still be here.

671
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:38,578
Maybe I won't.

672
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:54,629
We all make choices, Bruce.

673
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,964
I chose hope.

674
00:39:06,008 --> 00:39:07,522
And I chose to believe Beth

675
00:39:07,523 --> 00:39:09,077
was still alive.

676
00:39:09,078 --> 00:39:10,781
I chose to save my sister

677
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:12,080
from the monster she's become,

678
00:39:12,081 --> 00:39:14,015
but by making that choice...

679
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:16,784
I lost my entire family
for the second time,

680
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:18,835
and now the only thing I'm left with

681
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:21,322
is the awful truth that Alice was right.

682
00:39:21,323 --> 00:39:23,791
Beth is gone.

683
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:39,273
My lawyer could only get us 5 minutes.

684
00:39:39,274 --> 00:39:42,844
I hate her so much, Dad.

685
00:39:42,845 --> 00:39:46,179
When I get out of here, I'm gonna
put her down once and for all.

686
00:39:48,282 --> 00:39:50,650
This time, I won't stop you.

For so many years,

689
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,470
- I've traveled across worlds,
- _

690
00:40:09,471 --> 00:40:12,507
across the multiverse to do one thing...

691
00:40:12,508 --> 00:40:14,909
Kill you,

692
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:19,380
and now here, you save my life.

693
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:24,819
Submit and begin your life anew.

694
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,487
Show me.

695
00:40:26,488 --> 00:40:28,989
The knowledge is within you.
