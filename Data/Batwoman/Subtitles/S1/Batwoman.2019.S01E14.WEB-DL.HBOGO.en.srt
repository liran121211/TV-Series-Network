1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,280
{\an5}<i>Duela, hurry up. It's time to go.</i>

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,760
<i>First, apply your base
and rub it all around.</i>

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,080
<i>Then follow your hollow
to shave off the pounds.</i>

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,480
<i>Fine-line your lips,
to hide that off-putting frown.</i>

5
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,320
<i>Duela, get out here.
We have to go.</i>

6
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,720
<i>Come on. We're gonna be late.</i>

7
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,880
Duela, I am so not kidding...

8
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,960
Oh, my God! Your... your face!

9
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Have a good one.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,280
- Mary. Hey.
- Hi.

11
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,960
- Super cute boots.
- Thanks.

12
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,720
You're in a good mood.

13
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,040
{\an5}You say that like it's a bad thing.

14
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,240
Where's my cowl?

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,160
In the shop.

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,880
- Giving it a little upgrade.
- Upgrade?

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,600
Like...

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,200
- X-ray vision?
- No.

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
Echolocation?

20
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,280
{\an5}That would've been a really good
idea, but no.

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,240
{\an5}- Somebody's in a good mood.
- Am I?

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,840
{\an5}You so are. Like giddy happy.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,200
{\an5}I'm not allowed to be happy?

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,320
{\an5}You just got suspended
from the Crows, so no.

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,680
{\an5}Oh, my God, you're sleeping
with someone.

26
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,040
{\an5}I'm not sleeping with anyone.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,600
{\an5}But, can we please pause for
a moment to appreciate

28
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,720
the fact that those words

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,200
- actually came out of your mouth?
- Okay, fine, hooking up with.

30
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,840
{\an5}- We shared a moment.
- With?

31
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,760
With?

32
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,160
If you tell anyone,

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,120
{\an5}it'll take me an hour
to hide your body.

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Spill.

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,320
- Batwoman.
<i>- No, you didn't.</i>

36
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,800
{\an5}It was a peck.
That lasted several minutes.

37
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,640
Batwoman can't have a girlfriend.

38
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,760
- It was a kiss, Luke.
- Yeah. Last night. Then what?

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
You really wanna know
the answer to that?

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,480
{\an5}Does she know who you are?

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,440
I have no idea.

42
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,280
{\an5}Which, I admit,
is a little strange, but...

43
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
- You said, you knew who she was.
- I thought I did.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,240
I was wrong.
Like, really, really wrong.

45
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,120
{\an5}- So, you seriously have no idea?
- No.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,360
Wait, do you?

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
No.

48
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,200
You finally get Sophie off your tail.
Now, you swapping spit with her.

49
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,440
I don't think you know
what kissing is.

50
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,880
I don't think you know
what Bruce went through...

51
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,840
{\an5}why Batman pushed people away.

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,960
{\an5}You realize the moment anyone knows
Batwoman cares about Sophie...

53
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,520
{\an5}it puts a target on her back?

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,360
{\an5}She becomes a liability.

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,640
{\an5}- Nobody needs to find out.
- Doesn't mean they won't, Kate.

56
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,080
She totally just texted you,
didn't she?

57
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,400
She wants to meet at my place later.

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,960
I'm leaving now.

59
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,000
Have fun. And, Sophie.

60
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,760
I'm happy for you.

61
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,840
{\an5}<i>"Alice, aka Jane Doe 7113,</i>

62
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,720
{\an5}<i>the deranged leader
of the Wonderland Gang,</i>

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,400
{\an5}<i>was fatally gunned down last week
in a motel parking lot</i>

64
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,600
<i>by an unidentified shooter.</i>

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,760
{\an5}<i>"No services are planned
at this time"?</i>

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,680
{\an5}I'm sorry, this is my obituary?

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,800
{\an5}<i>"Mentally-deranged leader"?</i>

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,560
That's my synopsis?

69
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,280
A tiny little blurb below the fold?

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,080
I survived captivity
for 11 years, escaped

71
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,040
and enacted the perfect revenge.

72
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,160
- What took you so long?
- Wanted to get a clear shot of him.

73
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,800
That's not the face
I see in my nightmares...

74
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,720
but I'd recognize
that pipe anywhere.

75
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,360
Even in the dark.

76
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
It's him.

77
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,600
As you know, some wacko
dubbed The Executioner

78
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,080
blew a hole in the city's corrupt

79
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,480
court system a few months back.

80
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,440
And I blew a hole in him.
What's your point?

81
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,120
It forced the DA's office to reopen
a bunch of his old cases,

82
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,920
and then, funnel them through
a new judge.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,160
But you know this new judge.
Davis Wellington?

84
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,960
Crows contracts dating back to 2004.

85
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,960
My client hopes
that you call the judge

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,400
and get him to move his case up.

87
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,320
Why would I do that?

88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,560
Because my client's Reggie Harris.

89
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,160
And you owe him your life.

90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,880
Thank you.

91
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,600
You're better to me alive, puppy dog.

92
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,120
<i>Reggie is an opportunist</i>

93
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,200
using this cabal nonsense
as a get-out-of-jail-free card.

94
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,680
He confessed to gunning down
Lucius Fox in a C-store robbery.

95
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,280
That confession was coerced
by a corrupt GCPD cop.

96
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,200
- Not a Crows problem.
- Yet.

97
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,760
Based on some whispers

98
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,760
my client heard in the slammer
about this place,

99
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,520
the Crows have some secrets
of their own.

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,440
That almost sounded like a threat.

101
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
It is.

102
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,840
Let's not turn it into more.

103
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,960
Call the judge, get him
to move Reggie's court date up.

104
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,960
Or this place gets blown open
the same way the DA's office did.

105
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,040
<i>I leave gold on
the floor wherever I go</i>

106
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,400
<i>Yeah, I'm killing it, I'm killing
it I'm stealing the show</i>

107
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,640
<i>Words fall out my mouth
And they break the door</i>

108
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,840
<i>Like, oh, na-na-na...</i>

109
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,320
<i>So we're at the beat
And everybody boom, boom</i>

110
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,320
<i>Your eyes on me
Make your body vroom-vroom</i>

111
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,480
<i>I break the rules,
but I make the rules</i>

112
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,880
<i>Like, ooh, na-na-na...</i>

113
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,440
<i>Lekka to be me, strong and free
Doing what I do</i>

114
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,560
<i>Do what I do, what I do now</i>

115
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,360
<i>Hey, hey, hey...</i>

116
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,440
This is definitely a first.

117
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,120
Me too, actually.

118
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,440
So...

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,280
Do you wanna come inside?

120
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
I can't.

121
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,960
I came here to tell you,
this has to end...

122
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,680
- before you get hurt.
- I can take care of myself.

123
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
This is different.

124
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,960
I have enemies.

125
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,240
If they connected us,
they could use you against me.

126
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,560
Well, I won't tell them if you don't.

127
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,880
You know it's not that simple.

128
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,600
So, what do you suggest?

129
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,640
That we walk away.

130
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Okay.

131
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
So walk.

132
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,920
<i>I can't help that
I wanna do bad things</i>

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,320
<i>Bad things, bad things...</i>

134
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,320
- Someone's here.
- I'm on it.

135
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,040
No. I got it.

136
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,200
Give your own mother a heart attack.

137
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,920
Mom, what are you doing here?

138
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,480
Surprising you.

139
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,760
Next time, I'll call first.

140
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,440
- We're locking up.
- I'm on the phone.

141
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,080
My company's valuation
is twice that much.

142
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,200
I don't care about fixed capital.

143
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,080
Look at our intangible assets,
i.e. me.

144
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,440
My brand. My image.
You can't put a price on that.

145
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,480
I'm gonna have to call you back.

146
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,640
They had no budget
for this photo shoot

147
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,960
and it's starting to show.

148
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Hello?

149
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,240
Is anyone there?

150
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,960
Not even like a janitor or someone?

151
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Who's there?

152
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,080
<i>Talk about the unkindest cut.</i>

153
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,200
<i>Social media influencer Kimberly
Wright was the victim</i>

154
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,680
<i>of a brutal face-slashing last night.</i>

155
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,240
<i>GCPD suspect this is now
the second social media influencer</i>

156
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,240
<i>attacked by the serial slash-onista.</i>

157
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,280
<i>Talk to me, Gotham. Where's
the dislike button when you need it?</i>

158
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,680
How'd it go with Sophie?

159
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Sophie...

160
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,720
Well, she...

161
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,400
It was really cold
and it was a bit hard to hear

162
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,280
and then, her mom just showed up
out of nowhere.

163
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,280
So, dog ate my breakup?

164
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,960
There is a lunatic with a box cutter
targeting kids. We need to focus.

165
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,800
Already on it.

166
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,720
Kimberly Wright described her
attacker as a woman in her 20s

167
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,600
who wore a hoodie
and a surgical mask.

168
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,000
That's why the GCPD can't ID her.

169
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,200
Interestingly, neither of the victims
had any stab wounds on their bodies.

170
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,200
She went after their face.
Their face is their brand.

171
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,840
Their business. This is personal.

172
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Where you off to?

173
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,440
To see the only Instaface
I care about.

174
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,480
Yeah, and it's
all my feed is talking about.

175
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,080
Even Kylie Q is threatening
to go web-silent out of respect.

176
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,240
Thank you, doctor.

177
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,520
Are you okay?

178
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,080
I mean, I barely knew Kimberly.

179
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,160
But still, it's pretty freaky.

180
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,360
And don't worry, my fan base left

181
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
when my stepdad supposedly
killed my mom.

182
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,080
- So I am hardly worth the data.
- Good.

183
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,400
Not about the fanbase.
I mean, that sucks.

184
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,320
Do you anyone in that circle
that could be a target?

185
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,160
Well, it depends on who you ask.

186
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,680
I mean, everybody knows that Kimberly
Wright has Miley McGinn's nose.

187
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,360
Except me, apparently.

188
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,880
Same corrective surgery. Shape,
slope, length. I mean, it's a thing.

189
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,720
People were even whispering maybe

190
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,640
Miley had something to do
with the attack.

191
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,640
Pissed that Kimberly stole her nose.

192
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,640
But if you think about it,
Miley copied Mia's cheekbones.

193
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,280
And Mia and Xena have the same chin,

194
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,560
which I believe belonged
to Ariana at one point.

195
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,760
Anyway, I am sure there's a
"who's who of potential victims"

196
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,000
in Dr. Campbell's waiting room
as we speak.

197
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,960
- Dr. Ethan Campbell?
- Yeah.

198
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,480
The only plastic surgeon in
this city worth going to.

199
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,280
Not that I would know.
Actually, if you're looking into this

200
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,160
because you own a real estate firm

201
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,160
and these women are most
likely future property buyers...

202
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,800
Exactly. Yeah.

203
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,720
I'm around if you need
a side person.

204
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,040
I mean, I'm a DM away
from half these girls.

205
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,240
I'd be happy to poke around
for some clues or whatever.

206
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,160
It's probably safest if
you stayed out of it.

207
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
I might ask someone to drop by
Campbell, just give him a heads up.

208
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,960
I can do it.

209
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,000
I mean, I'm a med student
where he lectures.

210
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,360
So, now that I think about it,

211
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,960
my vast array of medical knowledge
could come in handy

212
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,480
in endless scenarios.

213
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,440
I'm good, Mary. Thank you.

214
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,680
Okay... Well, I'm happy to help.

215
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,880
Bye, Mary.

216
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,560
Rewind.

217
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,960
You and your husband separate
and you didn't think to call me?

218
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,040
I thought it was best
to let the dust settle.

219
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,360
Where is my phone?

220
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,400
I will tell Tyler all
the ways he's making

221
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,120
- the biggest mistake of his life.
- Mom, stop.

222
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,120
It's not like that.

223
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,520
- It was me.
- You?

224
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
I...

225
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,960
I fell out of love with him.

226
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,680
You fell out of love with a handsome,
decorated, capable man

227
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
who always sent me flowers
on my birthday.

228
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,120
Why don't you give me the real story?

229
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,920
Mom, that is the real story.

230
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,600
Well, Jacob Kane called.
He told me about your suspension.

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
So that's why you're in town.

232
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,480
This isn't some motherly
I-missed-you visit.

233
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,480
More of a
please-don't-end-up-under-a-bridge

234
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,080
visit. How are you going to
pay the rent?

235
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,840
By working at a place
that aligns with my values.

236
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,480
I don't see eye-to-eye

237
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,280
with the Crow's way
of doing things anymore.

238
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,440
Oh, please don't tell me you wish
they were more like the GCPD.

239
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
No.

240
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,960
More like Batwoman.

241
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,400
She is someone
who represents all of Gotham.

242
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,040
The poor, the rich and in-between.

243
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,640
She's saved my life
on several occasions...

244
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,480
She is a damn criminal
who gets away with it.

245
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,040
You never had a problem with Batman.

246
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,520
- You thought he was cute.
- Batman was different.

247
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,720
How, Mom? How was Batman different?

248
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,440
He represented values
I actually believed in.

249
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,280
You mean he's not gay.

250
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,280
Hey. I don't have a lot of time

251
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,400
so we should probably
make this quick.

252
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
You okay?

253
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,680
My mom. She...

254
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm 28-years-old, I have two degrees
and own a condo on a river.

255
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,560
And I spend every waking moment
wondering if she's proud of me.

256
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,080
And if she were
to find out about this?

257
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,080
Upside of having to hide it?
She won't.

258
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
So, what's up?

259
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,720
I did some digging.

260
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,640
And I think that Gotham's serial
slasher is targeting patients

261
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,840
from a plastic surgeon
by the name of Ethan Campbell.

262
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,280
I know him. His affidavit cleared my
boss of murder charges.

263
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,240
That's why I'm here.
I need you to find out what he knows.

264
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,760
I have no authority.
The Crows suspended me.

265
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,880
Does Campbell know that?

266
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,480
The last victim of the slasher
was also a patient of yours.

267
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,680
Mia Cortez.

268
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,920
We're worried the next
victim could be

269
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,320
a name on one of those files.

270
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,240
Kimberly Wright told every one
of her ten million followers

271
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
about her nose job.

272
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,560
So if it's a case of jealousy...

273
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,360
you have a lot
of names to sift through.

274
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,000
One theory
is she's targeting copycat surgeries.

275
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,840
- Have you ever...
- Cut a smile into a patient's face?

276
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,840
No, Agent Moore.
I certainly have not.

277
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,080
Then maybe
she's not targeting copycats.

278
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,800
Maybe she's making copycats.

279
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,800
By inflicting her victims
with the same scars she has?

280
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,280
Have you ever treated a woman
with this type of scarring?

281
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,320
Actually, yes. Eight years ago.

282
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,960
A teenage girl was brought to me

283
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,560
with a psychiatric rap sheet as
long as my arm.

284
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,000
And the worst self-inflicted scars
I've ever seen.

285
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,520
She cut her own face?

286
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,320
Yes, she did.

287
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,360
Duela Dent, what can you
find on her?

288
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,200
Daughter of Evelyn.
Father unknown.

289
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,560
Her Uncle Harvey is a beloved ADA.

290
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
<i>Wait, here's something.</i>

291
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,880
<i>She was just released
from a mental health facility.</i>

292
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,160
How did you get her name?

293
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,280
Bat sources, okay?

294
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,200
Would these Bat sources
be of the tall,

295
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,640
dark and girlfriend-material variety?

296
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,800
I'm choosing to ignore that.
I found something.

297
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,720
It's her hit list.

298
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,600
Run the name Myrtis Dinker.

299
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,920
Myrtis Dinker.

300
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,240
Nope. Nothing. No Myrtis Dinker.

301
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I have an idea.

302
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,080
Press the red button
on your right gauntlet.

303
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,480
Sorry. Your left gauntlet.

304
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,400
- That was your upgrade?
- Cowl-cam.

305
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,000
- What do you think?
- Use this without my permission

306
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,040
and I'll find a new place
to put my Batarang.

307
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,240
Yeah, copy that.
Running the image now.

308
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
And?

309
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,640
I'm still working out the bugs.

310
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,000
You're okay. It's okay. It's okay.

311
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,320
I'm gonna go get you help.

312
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,880
Just...

313
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,400
Come any closer and I turn
my mom into a Pez dispenser.

314
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,760
Duela, you don't need to do this.

315
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,120
And she didn't have to force me
to be someone I'm not.

316
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,440
Someone I hate.
Someone I can't even look at.

317
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,080
So I'm gonna go,
and you're gonna need a mop.

318
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,120
No! No.

319
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,280
Stay with me. Stay with me.

320
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,720
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

321
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,200
I have spent hours upon hours

322
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,360
cooking up all the ways
that I could torture that vile man.

323
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,800
Now, that he's right here,
right under my nose, I...

324
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,400
You're blocked.

325
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,320
Exactly, Dr. Malone.

326
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,840
I am blocked.

327
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,280
Don't be so hard on yourself.

328
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,840
It's a normal reaction.

329
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,400
Victims held in physical
and emotional captivity

330
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,520
oftentimes revert back to the age

331
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,200
they were held
when facing their captor.

332
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,360
So, what are you saying?

333
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,920
I don't find closure?

334
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,760
No, of course not.
But you clearly have unresolved fear.

335
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,640
My fear is
that I will kill him instantly.

336
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:09,720
Forgetting to relish
in his slow and painful demise.

337
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,240
Those are just
your defenses talking.

338
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,880
I don't have defenses.

339
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,040
If you don't mind,
in my professional opinion...

340
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,200
I see you're putting up a hard,
blustery exterior.

341
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,280
But the truth is,
you are still terrified of this man.

342
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,120
You are still just a little girl.

343
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,720
And you know, when you
confront him face-to-face

344
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,040
that he will find a way to regain
that power over you once again.

345
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,680
So, then... shrink me.

346
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,480
- What do I do?
- I suggest an emotional shield.

347
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,240
A third person that acts as a buffer
between you and the abuser.

348
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,920
You have been incredibly helpful,
Dr. Malone.

349
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,240
I do wish we could've made
this a weekly affair.

350
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,000
No, please.
No, I won't tell anyone you're alive.

351
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,520
Please. I won't tell anyone. Please!
Please, don't!

352
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,320
I won't tell anyone!

353
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,280
Well, well,
Dr. Fix-Me threatened with a lawsuit

354
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,520
by a 16-year-old who did not consent

355
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,560
to the restorative plastic surgery
he performed on her.

356
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,000
What an interesting little
psychopath.

357
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,000
How long are you gonna keep me here?

358
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,960
As long as it takes
for you to come to your senses?

359
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,680
Alice will find me.

360
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,680
Alice is dead.

361
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,680
No.

362
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
I shot her.

363
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,640
No. No.

364
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,520
No. No.

365
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,320
- Son...
- No, no.

366
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,720
You're better off without her.

367
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,400
All she ever did was put
your life in danger

368
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,880
to advance her own agenda.

369
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,840
All I've done

370
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,080
is protect you

371
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,080
from the cruelty of the world.

372
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,360
The only thing cruel
in my world is you.

373
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,920
You think that way now.

374
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,200
But in time...

375
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,600
- you'll come to see the truth.
- Get away.

376
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,400
What are you doing?
What are you doing to me?

377
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,680
What are you doing?

378
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,800
You wanted to see me, sir?

379
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,880
Our favorite ambulance chaser
Bobby Reeves stopped by.

380
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,400
He's poking around a murder case
your team ran point on.

381
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,400
Yeah. Hard to forget.

382
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,000
Harris gunned down Lucius Fox
and a cashier at a Sip & Dash.

383
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,760
What's the problem?
We turned him over to the GCPD.

384
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,240
Yeah, to Stu Donnelly.

385
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,360
The officer accused of coercing
confessions in at least 21 cases.

386
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,760
We handed a lot of perps over
to Donnelly, commander.

387
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,120
- Are we saying they're all innocent?
- You don't find it unusual

388
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,880
that the Sip & Dash's four security
cameras weren't working

389
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,240
in the five-hour window
when the robbery took place?

390
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,960
Only thing I find unusual

391
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,080
is Lucius Fox was a hero
to this city...

392
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,560
and people are trying
to set this killer free.

393
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,600
I was wondering
when you were gonna hit me up

394
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,400
- about the slasher case.
- How did you know?

395
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,360
Because I am smart and perceptive.
Two traits people often overlook.

396
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,200
Anyway, I was hoping
that you could help me ID someone.

397
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,600
Someone that doesn't pop up
in my facial recognition system.

398
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh! That's Veronica May.

399
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,200
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

400
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,120
Apparently, she changed her name
after high school.

401
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,160
And if my name was Myrtis Dinker,
I would, too.

402
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,360
And I'm guessing the reason
why her face stumped your Bat-tech

403
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,320
is because that's not her nose
anymore.

404
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,560
- Or her chin.
- Any idea how I can find her?

405
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,040
Well, she pretty much lives
onboard the May-Mobile.

406
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,000
- The what?
- It's part-makeover truck...

407
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,600
part-rolling billboard
for her makeup line.

408
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,160
Just look for the gaudiest thing on
the road.

409
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,480
<i>We need to find that cosmetics truck.</i>

410
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,040
I appreciate that,
but a truck in Gotham

411
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,480
kind of a needle in a haystack.

412
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,760
- The needle is hot pink.
- That narrows it down.

413
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,920
Let me run a color filter
on the satellite.

414
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,720
Okay. We've got an ice cream truck

415
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,040
an unfortunate paint job
on a Lambo...

416
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,680
That's not good.

417
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:35,320
Duela's been here.
No sign of Veronica.

418
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,880
Hold up. I think I got company.

419
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,320
- You shouldn't be here.
- Neither should you.

420
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,000
I've been listening into
the Crow's radio.

421
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,160
They'll be here any minute.

422
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,000
I'm not leaving until
I find every single person

423
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,160
that was in that truck.

424
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,600
Looks like Duela forced them
into another vehicle. Why here?

425
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,600
Veronica's skincare line is made
at the plant down the road.

426
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,760
<i>You by the truck</i>

427
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,280
- <i>get's your hands in the air now!</i>
- We have to get out of here.

428
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,600
Let's get out of here now! Come on!

429
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,360
- Get on.
- Wait, what?

430
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,600
Get on.

431
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,440
What the hell are you doing?

432
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

433
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,040
Do you have a problem

434
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,720
with people stealing
medical supplies?

435
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
Because...

436
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,520
- Hi.
- I thought I made it clear

437
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,040
how I felt about you when
I left you to die.

438
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,680
You did, but then I saved your life
and now you owe me, so...

439
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,840
- Did Batwoman not tell you?
- Not tell me what?

440
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,680
After Nocturna drained your blood,
you were on death's door.

441
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,680
I found you and revived you
with my own.

442
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,000
Meaning, I literally pumped life
back into your veins.

443
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,200
I need a bleach transfusion.

444
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,040
- I'll take that as a thank-you.
- Why would you do that?

445
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:27,080
Let's just say it was more about
Batwoman and less about you.

446
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
Thanks for the goods.

447
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,280
Do you know who she is?

448
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
Batwoman?

449
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Of course I do.

450
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,840
Do you not?

451
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Sad.

452
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,920
Guess you two aren't really pals
after all.

453
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,120
Duela, stop. Please. Let me down.

454
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,040
I'm helping you, Veronica.

455
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,560
I mean, Myrtis.

456
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,200
Oh, my God.
Look, you made your point, okay?

457
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,920
I wasn't a great friend
after the incident.

458
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,280
But honestly? I was afraid of you.

459
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,160
Because I was finally happy?

460
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,200
Happy people don't
slice their faces open.

461
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,480
What do they do?

462
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,240
Shave a bone off their nose?

463
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,560
Slit their eyelids open,
stab needles into their lips?

464
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,600
You know, the only difference
between you and me

465
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,080
is that I got institutionalized
and you got famous.

466
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,640
- My mother wanted me to be you.
- Put me down, you psycho!

467
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,640
It's time to show the world what
I see when I look at Veronica May.

468
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,880
No, Duela, stop! Please! Don't! No!

469
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,600
Going somewhere?

470
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,480
Tell me someone got that on camera.

471
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,760
So, should I take Veronica up
on her offer to share an Uber?

472
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,360
Call me crazy, but I felt
like we made a good team in there.

473
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,600
- We did.
- But?

474
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,760
How do you see this playing out?

475
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,600
Dinner, movie,
I take you back to my cave?

476
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,080
You live in a cave?

477
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,600
<i>Cold concrete beneath my back...</i>

478
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:45,000
I don't know. I guess
I haven't really thought about it.

479
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,080
If I were to tell you
who I am right now...

480
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,120
- would you wanna know?
- What?

481
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,040
Because once that happens,
I'm no longer a secret.

482
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,280
I'm a face.

483
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,160
A person.

484
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,600
A woman.

485
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,240
And I bring all the complications
that come with that.

486
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,120
So do you wanna be in a real
relationship,

487
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,800
or do you wanna be with someone
you can keep secret?

488
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,760
Because we can never
be more than this.

489
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,400
And that shouldn't be enough.

490
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,400
You're right.

491
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,000
As long as I'm with a woman
who wears a mask,

492
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,880
I'll always be wearing one myself.

493
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,240
I think I have some things
I need to figure out.

494
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,000
<i>When you're down...</i>

495
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,880
I'll let the GCPD know about Duela.

496
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,160
<i>When you're down, down, down...</i>

497
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,240
Goodbye, Sophie.

498
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,280
<i>Nowhere to go No further to fall</i>

499
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,240
<i>When you're on the floor</i>

500
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,240
<i>And you're already down</i>

501
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,920
<i>Down, down, down...</i>

502
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,920
<i>Down, down, down</i>

503
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,520
<i>Down, down, down...</i>

504
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Who's there?

505
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,840
Please! Help untie me, please.

506
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
- Who's there?
- An ally.

507
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,600
You and I were both wronged
by the same man.

508
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,720
He took my adolescence,
just like he took your smile.

509
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,880
I will get revenge for both of us.

510
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,760
But first, I'm gonna need
a little something from you.

511
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,200
You wanna explain this?

512
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,800
- It's a bank statement.
- I know it's a bank statement.

513
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,400
I don't know why the Crows
sent the Sip & Dash $50,000

514
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,320
after the Lucius Fox murder.

515
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,120
It says right here, Code 501.

516
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,680
A restoration courtesy payment

517
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,720
for us trashing the place
when we arrested Harris.

518
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,280
So this money has nothing to do
with the lost security footage?

519
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,120
You don't really think
a Crow would destroy evidence?

520
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,160
<i>Like the hunter on his prey</i>

521
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,560
<i>Once you think you got me trapped
I make my escape...</i>

522
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,240
I thought Dispatch said she was
locked up.

523
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,880
<i>I'm coming out of my cage...</i>

524
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,320
<i>I'm coming out of my cage...</i>

525
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,880
Duela.

526
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,720
How did you get in here?

527
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,680
Just flashed that pretty
smile you gave me.

528
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,000
- What's you got?
- Hold tight.

529
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,080
Over here.

530
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,160
- Is that the slasher?
<i>- I'm coming out of my cage...</i>

531
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,280
<i>I'm coming out of my</i>

532
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,720
Lord have mercy.

533
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,080
I'm finally perfect.

534
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,440
You shouldn't be here, Duela.

535
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Sorry.

536
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,160
You got the wrong girl.

537
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
No.

538
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,240
No, you're dead. I...

539
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
I shot you.

540
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,960
Again, you got the wrong girl.

541
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,560
You like taking things
from children, don't you?

542
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Well...

543
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,440
we're all grown up now...

544
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,840
And here for a little payback.

545
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,200
<i>I'm coming out of my cage...</i>

546
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,400
Moore. It's me.

547
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,520
Look. I may question
your decision-making

548
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,760
when it comes to Batwoman.

549
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,960
But, I've never questioned
your integrity.

550
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,320
And at the moment,
I need it more than ever.

551
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,800
I think the Crows have a major
problem.

552
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,760
I'll explain when you call me back.

553
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,240
Not sure how charging
five dollars for a coffee

554
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,680
is not a criminal offense.

555
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,640
I think you're gonna need
something stronger.

556
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,960
I lied to you the other day.

557
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,080
That's what I do now. I lie.

558
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,520
I lie so much I don't even realize
I'm doing it anymore.

559
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,360
Oh, Sophie.

560
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
What lie?

561
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,560
I didn't break up with Tyler...

562
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,400
because I fell out of love with him.

563
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,520
I broke up with Tyler
because I was never in love with him.

564
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,840
Sweetheart,
I need you to start making sense.

565
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,640
When I was at Point Rock...

566
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,640
I met someone.

567
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,520
And for the first time...

568
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,880
I was happy.

569
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,760
Really, really, happy.

570
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,240
And I wanna find that again.

571
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,520
Okay. Okay. Then go find him, honey.

572
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,360
- Go find him.
- It wasn't a him, Mom.

573
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,040
It was a her.

574
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,960
For years, I kept it a secret.

575
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,080
I thought I could have both.

576
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,360
The version of me that my school
and my family could be proud of...

577
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,560
and the version of me
who knew who she was.

578
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,880
<i>I try not to hold my breath</i>

579
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,480
So, the good Lord didn't make it
hard enough on you?

580
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,000
<i>I'm scared of the past</i>

581
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,840
Not enough to be a woman of color,
not enough to come from nothing,

582
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,760
not enough to have to prove your damn
worth to the world

583
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,960
every time you wanna be part of it?

584
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,800
You gotta add this on top of it?

585
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,200
I didn't ask for this.

586
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,000
Just like I didn't ask
for any of those things.

587
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,360
But each of them make
me who I am.

588
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,000
Why am I only hearing about it now?

589
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,240
Because I didn't want you
to look at me the way

590
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,680
- you're looking at me now.
- Oh, Sophie.

591
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,360
I am so sorry about that, sweetheart.

592
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,720
<i>I can feel the changes coming</i>

593
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,720
What did you expect disappointment
to look like?

594
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:02,400
<i>What I've been,
what I'm becoming...</i>

595
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,280
You look like you had a long night.

596
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,560
More like a really long day.

597
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,160
If you wanna talk about it,
if you wanna talk about anything...

598
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,400
you know I'm here, right?

599
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,560
I lost a piece of real estate
I had my heart set on.

600
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,760
But it wasn't the right move.
Timing was off.

601
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,560
<i>All the others here and now...</i>

602
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,880
Do you remember the day
that you came back to Gotham?

603
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,600
I threw you that welcome home party

604
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,640
and then six hours later,
I was stitching up your shoulder,

605
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,880
telling you
that I owned an illegal clinic?

606
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,120
Of course, I remember.

607
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,800
It never once occurred to me

608
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,920
that you'd tell my mom or your dad
that I was living a double-life.

609
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,360
Or that you'd try to shut me down,
or tell me I could get sued

610
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,080
or kicked out of school, or arrested.

611
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,000
I knew I didn't have
to worry about you judging me.

612
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,440
Because I trusted you.

613
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,440
So I hope one day
that you feel the same way about me.

614
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,600
What do you want?

615
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,920
For you to drop the act.

616
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,480
And the face.

617
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,280
I thought I would never have
to see you again.

618
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,240
But I was wrong.

619
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,120
I see this face every night
as I go to sleep

620
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,680
and every morning as I wake.

621
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,800
And sometimes, when I close my eyes
and shake too long.

622
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,720
If you're gonna kill me, do it.

623
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,560
Kill me.

624
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,320
Get it over with.

625
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,160
We mustn't speak of such nonsense.

626
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,280
I would never kill you.

627
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,680
At least not with these nimble little
fingers.

628
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
What do you want?

629
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,320
My brother Mouse.

630
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,360
Surely, you have him and I want him.

631
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,640
So, where is he?

632
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,440
Why is that so funny?

633
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
What?

634
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,040
Yeah.

635
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,840
I will tell you where you can find
your...

636
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,960
Precious Mouse.
