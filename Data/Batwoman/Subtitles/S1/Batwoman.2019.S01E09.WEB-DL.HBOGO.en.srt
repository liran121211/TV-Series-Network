1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,960
Never thought we'd be
pouring one out for Oliver.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,280
We're not gonna wait for Barry?

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,760
I don't think he's ready
to say goodbye.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,280
So, anybody wanna say
some words for Oliver?

5
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,480
He sacrificed himself
for me and Barry.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,080
- He shouldn't have done that.
- His sacrifice

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,440
saved a billion more people.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,560
Let's not call that a mistake.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,320
Look, Oliver died
the way he lived. A hero.

10
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,680
Not to rush a tender moment,

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,600
but I think the multiverse
is ending soon-ish, so...

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,440
No, I can't. I can't. Barry's right.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,800
It feels like giving up.

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,000
We managed to get
billions of people to safety.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,040
There has to be a way
we can undo this.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,720
Oliver, my mom, Argo, Earth.
All those Earths.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,200
All those people who vanished.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,960
There has to be a way
we can get them back.

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,080
Or we focus on stopping it
from happening

20
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,560
to every other universe.

21
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,840
Oh, hey, welcome to the joy zone.

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,440
- Where's Dig?
- At home with JJ.

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,520
He still doesn't know about Oliver.

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,320
- Lyla, you...
- I know. I just...

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,920
I need to figure out how to tell him.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,480
- Yeah.
- You can't just hijack

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,240
the <i>Waverider</i>.
Our crew is still on there.

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,160
If there is any chance
at surviving the Crisis,

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,560
- we need its technology.
- Who?

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,480
Yeah, I kind of promised our crew

31
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,720
they'd never have to do
another crossover.

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,640
We don't need your crew.
Just Ray's lab.

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,320
And we have an entire multiverse
of <i>Waveriders</i> at our disposal.

34
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
- Is anyone here?
<i>- Welcome aboard.</i>

35
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,240
<i>My name is Leonard, an interactive
artificial consciousness</i>

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,960
<i>programmed to operate
this vessel's critical systems.</i>

37
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,080
I know who you are.

38
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,560
<i>Always pleased to meet a fan.
But you're trespassing.</i>

39
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,680
<i>Any preference
on how you'd like to die?</i>

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,800
What he's saying is "Flame or frost?"

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,880
I thought the Legends
of Earth-74 are all retired.

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,800
We did. Well, some. One died.

43
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,640
No, one was using the ship,
so I took it.

44
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,240
It's my ship.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,760
- Why are you here?
- I like the quiet.

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,720
<i>He's trying to be a writer.</i>

47
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,480
- Shut up.
- <i>Of romance novels.</i>

48
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,640
<i>Well, you can see how that's going.</i>

49
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,800
It's going fine, you piece of...

50
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,680
<i>You're basically living out
of your car.</i>

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,720
- Listen, snowflake, I'm just...
- Boys.

52
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,160
Come with me, Mick Rory.

53
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,880
And I promise
you'll have plenty of beer

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,000
to drink and stories to tell.

55
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,800
The multiverse needs saving.
And its heroes need a ship.

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,840
You had me at "beer."

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
You have all lost a great hero.

58
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,320
The wrong hero.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,320
I do not disagree.

60
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,840
You have suffered a horrible loss.

61
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,440
But you have every reason
not to lose hope.

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,120
Seven, in fact.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,520
Across space and time...

64
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,920
Across space and time
exist seven heroes,

65
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,840
beings of the purest will,
who can ultimately...

66
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,480
- Sorry. Could you...
- What?

67
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Beings of the purest will,
who can ultimately...

68
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,960
It's not working.

69
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
No.

70
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,400
Beings of the purest will,

71
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,440
who can ultimately defeat
the Anti-Monitor...

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,600
and help save the multiverse.

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,160
- They are known as Paragons.
- Paragons?

74
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,480
And you're just dropping this
on us now?

75
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,960
I only recently learned
of their existence

76
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,800
by consulting the Book of Destiny.

77
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,320
How? We destroyed it last year.

78
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,400
After Oliver's early demise,

79
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,640
I went back into the time stream
and retrieved it intact.

80
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,280
It is now safely stored
in this ship's library.

81
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,720
So, it's, what, plan B?

82
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
It's comforting.

83
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,560
Anyone else wishing
they'd done that shot?

84
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,800
But wait.
If the book can rewrite destiny,

85
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,680
can it bring back Earth-38?

86
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,560
Or any of the other Earths?

87
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,560
Trying to recreate an entire world

88
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,280
would surely drive one to madness.

89
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
What about my dad?
Could it bring him back?

90
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,840
I wish it could.

91
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,600
While Oliver Queen was to die
in this Crisis,

92
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,040
this is not how I saw events unfold.

93
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,640
But as the Anti-Monitor
gets stronger, I grow weaker.

94
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,640
We must find all seven Paragons.

95
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,040
- How about, like, a hint?
- I have four.

96
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,960
Kara Zor-El,

97
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,880
despite all you have endured,

98
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,280
you are the Paragon of Hope.

99
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,000
Well, you might wanna
double-check your omnipotence.

100
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,040
Because I'm not feeling
that hopeful right now.

101
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,600
Sara Lance is the Paragon of Destiny.

102
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,920
Oh, well, that makes sense.

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,600
Captain of time travel and all that.

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,400
I have only descriptions
for the other two Paragons.

105
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,400
One is of a second Kryptonian

106
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,440
who is said to have suffered
a greater loss

107
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,800
than most mortal men could endure.

108
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,240
Today, he stands
as the Paragon of Truth.

109
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
- I'll find him.
- I'll go with you.

110
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,680
- And the fourth?
- The Paragon of Courage.

111
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,160
He's known only
as "the bat of the future."

112
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,400
Seriously,
where do you get these names

113
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,640
and pseudo-names anyway?

114
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,000
I enlisted the assistance
of Felicity Smoak,

115
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,600
who earned the wisdom
of a second book.

116
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,040
- A lot of books.
- The Tome of the Guardians.

117
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,000
It revealed the names of Ms. Zor-El

118
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,280
and Ms. Lance
as well as the other two.

119
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,520
Bummed-Out Kryptonian
and Future Bat,

120
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,120
which technically means...

121
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,600
Earth-99 exists in a future time.

122
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,840
Where Bruce Wayne
has dedicated himself,

123
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,120
body and soul, to fighting crime.

124
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,400
I'm sorry. Go back.
Bruce Wayne is the Dark Knight?

125
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,760
If we could all keep that
to ourselves, that'd be great.

126
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,920
The path to find him

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,360
will lead you
to the Paragon of Courage.

128
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,320
Okay. Who wants to meet Batman?

129
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,760
{\an5}An entire universe
wiped from existence

130
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,800
distilled down
to a computer graphic.

131
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,640
{\an5}Gotta say, missing that wow factor.

132
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,200
{\an5}- Lena killed you.
- Yeah. Only for a little while.

133
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,320
Everyone has a part to play,
even Lex Luthor.

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,480
You did this?

135
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,720
{\an5}You brought
that poisonous snake back?

136
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,640
{\an5}His destiny was unfulfilled.

137
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,680
Lex Luthor still has
an important role to play.

138
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,000
{\an5}So, you could revive him,
but you can't bring back Oliver?

139
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,200
I restored Luthor
long before the Crisis

140
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,600
caused my power to wane.

141
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,880
And what about
those innocent lives on Earth-38?

142
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,080
{\an5}Did they not have destinies
to fulfill?

143
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,040
{\an5}I'm sorry, but I can't trust

144
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,080
{\an5}a man who thinks
Lex Luthor is an ally.

145
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,320
{\an5}All I got from that
is that if you die again

146
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,760
that dude can't bring you back.

147
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,760
- And you are?
- New.

148
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,480
And unfriendly.

149
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,960
{\an5}Lex Luthor. Kind of a dick?

150
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,440
When I think of all those people
on my Earth

151
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,200
{\an5}that we wanted to save
but couldn't...

152
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,720
{\an5}It just feels unfair.

153
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,640
{\an5}Look, a day ago, I didn't think
my life could get any worse.

154
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,400
{\an5}My sister murdered my stepmom
and... and framed my dad for it.

155
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,720
{\an5}That's dark, even for Gotham.

156
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,560
{\an5}I'm fighting for a chance
to make it right.

157
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,440
{\an5}And this fourth Paragon,
my cousin Bruce on another Earth?

158
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,320
Finding him might help me
get that chance.

159
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,880
Only if you believe the Monitor.

160
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,480
What kind of talk is that
from the Paragon of Hope?

161
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,320
Come with me.
Let's go save the universe.

162
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,600
<i>Stop...</i>

163
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,080
<i>Stop him. Before he finds the book...</i>

164
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,560
<i>Stop him before he finds the book.</i>

165
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,840
<i>Find the book. Stop Lex Luthor.</i>

166
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,480
You're not supposed to have that.

167
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,640
And man was never meant to fly,
but here we are.

168
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,320
Goodbye, Superman. All of you.

169
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,640
<i>Stop him!</i>

170
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,720
Lex Luthor has the Book of Destiny.

171
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,960
He's going to use it
to kill Supermen.

172
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,400
If he kills the Paragon,
we're all doomed.

173
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,280
{\an5}- What have you done?
- As I said,

174
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,800
{\an5}everyone has a part to play.

175
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,160
I'm glad you're here.

176
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Me too.

177
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,680
{\an5}And from what you told me,

178
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,240
{\an5}the Monitor was wrong about Oliver.

179
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,400
{\an5}So I don't know, Barry.
Maybe he's wrong about you too.

180
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,040
{\an5}Maybe you're not supposed to die.

181
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,560
{\an5}Listen, Oliver told me

182
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,760
{\an5}about how he brought Sara
and his sister back to life

183
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,920
using something called a Lazarus Pit.

184
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,440
{\an5}I don't know.
That sounds too good to be true.

185
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,160
{\an5}Well, maybe it is.

186
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,160
{\an5}It turns out Thea destroyed
all the Pits on this Earth

187
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,680
{\an5}but there are more Earths
to choose from.

188
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,520
I know that you want Oliver back
more than anything, but this is...

189
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,840
{\an5}He can't be dead.

190
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,280
Not him.

191
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,960
Okay.

192
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,840
{\an5}Funny enough, the Monitor gave me
a mission of my own.

193
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,080
{\an5}To find our hopeless
Kryptonian Paragon.

194
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,280
{\an5}Do you ever think
this would be our life?

195
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,280
{\an5}I will take whatever life
with you I can get.

196
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,800
So I missed one group chat,
and now there's Paragons,

197
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,200
and I'm supposed to be one of them?

198
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,880
Yep.

199
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,120
And Barry and I
are gonna use a Lazarus Pit

200
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,360
to bring my dad back.

201
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,200
Mia,

202
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,240
it's not that simple.

203
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,040
The Lazarus Pit
isn't some magical mud bath

204
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,240
{\an5}where you get your soul
in a cup of cucumber water

205
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
{\an5}at the end.

206
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,120
You lose your humanity.

207
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,120
{\an5}Nyssa told me everything I need
to know about Lazarus Pits.

208
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,720
{\an5}And she told me everything
I need to know about you.

209
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,480
{\an5}Why don't you share your opinion
when it's about your life?

210
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,000
{\an5}Why don't you share your opinion
when it's about your dad?

211
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,480
So the Paragon of Courage

212
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,280
is apparently afraid of yard work.

213
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
Better let me do the talking.

214
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,960
Wow, that's
a really impressive six-pack.

215
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,560
Sorry, do I know you?

216
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,960
- No.
- No, but I know you.

217
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,320
Well, a different, like,
a less this version of you.

218
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,800
I... I'm... I'm Kate Kane.
I'm Bruce's cousin.

219
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,200
Yeah, no.

220
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,600
- Earth-One villain?
- Only friend, actually.

221
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,080
Oh, well, at least he's cute.

222
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,040
No. Let's not make that weird.
That's weird.

223
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,000
- Can I just... Okay.
- Please.

224
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,720
You need to leave. Now.

225
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,840
Don't be so rude, Luke.

226
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,400
You'll have to forgive him.

227
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,760
We're not used to having guests.

228
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
Kate?

229
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Bruce?

230
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,760
- Where is Luke taking Kara?
- Library.

231
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,600
Just while we get to know
each other again.

232
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,440
Another Bruce I knew wore
a different kind of suit.

233
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,600
Lifetime of injuries.

234
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,520
But you've aged well for a dead girl.

235
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,080
I died?

236
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,720
Five years ago.

237
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,640
Never been a ghost before.

238
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,040
Plenty of ghosts in this place.

239
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,040
But you're not one of them.

240
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,400
Clayface is a puddle of mud.

241
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,840
And last I checked,
Jane Doe was locked in Arkham.

242
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,200
So, who the hell are you?

243
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,920
Can you...
Can you sit in that thing?

244
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,400
Because you're gonna need
to for this.

245
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,000
- Hang on.
- What is it?

246
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Iris.

247
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,840
We have a new problem.

248
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,720
It turns out Lex Luthor is alive.

249
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,480
- What?
- According to Iris,

250
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,720
Lex is jumping
from universe to universe,

251
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,280
killing off Supermen.

252
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,120
If one of them's
the Kryptonian Paragon...

253
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,520
It's game over.

254
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,480
We need to find this Earth's Superman

255
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,560
before Lex jumps here and offs him.

256
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,360
I think it's a little late for that.

257
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,880
"Disappeared into thin air."

258
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,600
Lex killed him and breached out.

259
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,240
He won't stop until we're all dead.

260
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,480
You're sure you wanna do this?

261
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,800
- Lazarus Pits. Nasty business.
- We're sure.

262
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,920
Hey, we don't have a lot of time,

263
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,440
so could you please take
your smoke break later.

264
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,520
- Maybe just do the spell?
- Simmer down, Speedy.

265
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,760
This is the spell.

266
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,800
It's all in the wrist.

267
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,240
What is it? Some kind of star map?

268
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,000
Parallel Earths. Spread out
by vibrational frequency.

269
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,400
We are well and truly bollocksed.

270
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,760
So many Earths already gone
and more vanishing as we speak.

271
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,920
I give you the needle
in the celestial haystack,

272
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,440
an Earth
with a functioning Lazarus Pit.

273
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,320
Okay, well, now what?

274
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,080
Perhaps a thank you?

275
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,800
And a little well-earned awe
for a magical job well done?

276
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
How about I thank you
when you bring my dad back?

277
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,000
- Hey, come on. Let's go.
- Yeah.

278
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,160
We can't screw this up, okay?

279
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,560
When we bring back Oliver back,

280
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,560
I need you to promise me
you can bring back his soul.

281
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,320
See, yeah, one thing at a time,
right, love?

282
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,480
- I need to hear you say it.
- I'll do it.

283
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,960
- Thank you.
- To the best of my abilities.

284
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Is that him?

285
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,520
It's either him or the buff guy
on the paper towel rolls.

286
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,200
I can do that with one bare hand.

287
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
Hello.

288
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
- Hi.
- Hi.

289
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,200
You are Clark Kent, right?

290
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,560
Can I help you?

291
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,320
Yeah. Hopefully.

292
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,600
So this universe
and an infinite number of others

293
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,640
is in the process of blinking
out of existence,

294
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,680
and there are seven people
in all of space and time

295
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
who can supposedly...

296
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,520
Lex Luthor is gonna try to kill you.

297
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,560
- Lois.
- He is.

298
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,040
- Lex?
- Yeah.

299
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,080
I didn't know the president
was in town.

300
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,720
Look, I've faced
a lot of things, things...

301
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
Hello, old friend.

302
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Who are you?

303
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,080
Don't you know me, Clark?

304
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,240
I'm Lex Luthor.

305
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,720
You're not Lex.

306
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,480
Maybe not the Lex you know.

307
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,120
The multiverse
has a way of aligning fates.

308
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,480
What'd you do with those people?

309
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,840
Sent them back to
their flying tin can in the sky.

310
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,720
Let's hope they learn
from this teachable moment.

311
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,640
- I'm here for you, not them.
- Whoever you are,

312
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,400
I'm just a guy working on his farm.

313
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,280
You will always be
my greatest enemy. On any Earth.

314
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,120
It's written in the stars
and in this book.

315
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,920
Or I wouldn't know
that on this Earth,

316
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,880
Clark Kent is Superman.

317
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,640
Where I come from,
that would be ridiculous.

318
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,280
He can't see past his glasses.

319
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,320
- So, what do you want?
- Why, to kill you, of course,

320
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,960
and every version of you
across the multiverse.

321
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,400
So that if the Superfriends

322
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,120
somehow find a way
to save existence,

323
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,440
there won't be a single Superman
to stand in my way.

324
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,040
That's kryptonite.

325
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,000
Which has no effect on me
ever since I gave up my powers.

326
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,040
You "gave up" your powers?

327
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,360
Can't say I've missed these chats.

328
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,120
You were basically a god.

329
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,800
You could fly.

330
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,840
You could see through walls.
You had super strength.

331
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
You're kidding me.

332
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,320
That is worth more than
any superpower.

333
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,160
Hey, Clark. The girls want
to show you what they made.

334
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,520
I think it's time for you to...

335
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,680
I'm still stronger.

336
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,520
You took all the fun out of it.

337
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,640
Enjoy your little slice of
mediocrity while you can, Clark.

338
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,960
You're all doomed anyway.

339
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,360
Hey.

340
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,960
Was somebody here, or were you
talking to the cows again?

341
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,680
It was Lex Luthor from another Earth.

342
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,040
Apparently, the multiverse is ending.

343
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,320
Smallville, you made a funny.

344
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,760
It's taken you about a decade,

345
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,560
but you're getting the hang of it.

346
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,320
- What'd the girls make?
- A mess.

347
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,640
They can't wait for you to see it.

348
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,120
Sounds like a job for us.

349
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,680
Paragon of Courage?

350
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yeah.

351
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,520
You're a few years too late.

352
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,120
"Reign of terror"?

353
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,440
It's like a wise man once said.

354
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,120
"Battle not with monsters,

355
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,720
lest you become a monster."

356
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,440
I've lost track
of how many people I've killed.

357
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,680
The Bruce I knew had a code.

358
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,280
You start with a code.

359
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,440
You hang on to it
with every self-righteous breath,

360
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,440
but then you take one life...

361
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,200
Then another and another
and another...

362
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,560
You'll see.

363
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,200
My Kate...

364
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,440
My Kate put on the cape,

365
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,360
thought she'd succeed where I failed.

366
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,080
All she did was get herself killed.

367
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,440
Well, I'm not her.

368
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
And I'm not an old man

369
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,560
held together with wire and metal.

370
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
Fine.

371
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,480
You're a broken,
pissed-off old hermit.

372
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,760
Waiting to die in this
11-bedroom, seven-bath coffin.

373
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,240
But, apparently, you're needed.

374
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,160
I'm giving you the chance
to be a hero again.

375
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,760
And not just to Gotham.

376
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,280
To the whole damn universe.

377
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,960
Mick, if you could...

378
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,520
I just... I really need
to concentrate

379
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,600
if I'm ever gonna finish
this Paragon detector

380
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,440
- the Monitor asked for.
- Sure.

381
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,560
<i>"Once he awoke her desire,
he was hers to explore willingly."</i>

382
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,600
- Is that your...
- <i>Caged Passion</i>.My romance novel.

383
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,440
<i>- Your only novel. Self-published.</i>
- Still counts.

384
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,120
Mick, your book doesn't sound
too kid-friendly.

385
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,720
It's very friendly. Kid loves it.

386
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,440
Look at him.

387
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,000
Anyway, chapter 19.

388
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,320
<i>"As he caressed
the nape of her back,</i>

389
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
<i>he struck like a cobra."</i>

390
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,120
You like that? So do I.
It's my best writing. Anyway...

391
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,120
Now, this is a newspaper.

392
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,240
Ray tracked Lex's last breach
to this Earth,

393
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,520
so he can't be far.

394
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,320
Well, let's find him, me,
Clark, before Lex does.

395
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,240
Oh, excuse me. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

396
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,640
- It's my fault.
- It's mine.

397
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Mine.

398
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,440
I'm sorry. You seem so familiar.
Have we met before?

399
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,440
- He looks just like Ray Palmer.
- Who?

400
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,240
Hey, nice glasses.

401
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,440
Thanks. Do you have a second?

402
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,440
Sure. For a citizen
of Metropolis, always.

403
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,040
If you wouldn't mind contacting
my assistant...

404
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,360
It's about Lex Luthor.

405
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,600
How did you say you knew Kate?

406
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Oh, I didn't.

407
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,960
We're still sort of getting
to know each other.

408
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
What are those?

409
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,800
Mementos.

410
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,560
From Batman's greatest victories.

411
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,040
You mean trophies.

412
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,240
Yeah, those belonged to Superman.
His alter ego at least.

413
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,960
Bruce killed this Earth's Superman?

414
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,920
Who do you think put him
in that exoskeleton?

415
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,280
Yeah, big mistake.

416
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,760
I appreciate your concern,

417
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,760
but this isn't my first go-around
with Luthor.

418
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
I can handle him.

419
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,920
That's what you're not hearing.
He's changed the game.

420
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,080
Yeah, the book allows him
to do anything.

421
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
He made us vanish
right in front of the last Clark.

422
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,760
What is this?

423
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,800
Perry White. Jimmy Olsen. Lois Lane.

424
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,200
Why are all these names
on your wall?

425
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,560
The reject from Gotham felt
that we didn't cover him enough.

426
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,200
So he played what he called
a practical joke...

427
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,360
- And gassed the building.
- All these people died?

428
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,360
My friends,

429
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
my wife...

430
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,440
I lost everyone in one fell swoop.

431
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,080
Almost as if you've been
through more loss

432
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,720
than any mortal man could endure.

433
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,960
I think we just found our Paragon.

434
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,080
We need you to come back with us.

435
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,680
I know this sounds insane, but...

436
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,680
You might be the key
to saving the multiverse.

437
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,680
That's actually one of the least
insane things I've ever heard.

438
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,160
First, stay and face Luthor.

439
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,080
And you won't do it alone.

440
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,360
- We won't let him kill you.
- Oh, I've moved on from that.

441
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,880
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm tired of killing Supermen.

442
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,200
So much more fun making Superman

443
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,920
kill Superman.

444
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,040
You don't belong here.

445
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,240
We're here because we need your help.

446
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,520
Help? I couldn't even save
my wife, my friends.

447
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,320
I don't care about your universe.

448
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,680
Yes, you do.

449
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,800
You're the Paragon of Truth.

450
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,360
There's only one truth.

451
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,280
I serve Lex Luthor.

452
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,640
Kal, stop.

453
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
Oh, what did Lex do?

454
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,720
You have to get Luthor
out of your head, Kal.

455
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,280
The multiverse needs you.

456
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,840
And what about what I need?

457
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,280
Come on, honey. You got this.

458
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,440
Kal, no.

459
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,520
Let me show you how it feels
to lose the ones you love.

460
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,640
- Oh, my god.
- Get away from the window.

461
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,320
This should be fun.

462
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,080
You can read about it later.
Help me with the book.

463
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,280
Okay, picture the Clark that we met.

464
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,640
Focus on what the universe knows
he's meant to be.

465
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,560
There's only room in this world
for one of us.

466
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,000
I'm pretty sure it's not working.

467
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,040
It's like, it's like Lex turned
all of his love into hate.

468
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,640
Love.

469
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,760
Clark, this isn't you.
Not the real Clark,

470
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,880
the one that Perry White respected

471
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,360
and Jimmy Olsen looked up to
and Lois loved.

472
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,440
You know nothing about me or them.

473
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,480
They know more than you think.

474
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,280
They would want your memories
of them to lift you up,

475
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,040
not drive you to darkness.

476
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,560
That's the truth, Clark.

477
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,280
And the truth
means everything to you.

478
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,560
Remember who you are.

479
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
You okay?

480
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,120
Actually, this is the second time
I've gone nuts and fought myself.

481
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,760
I can see why you married her.

482
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,440
Yeah, this is the place.

483
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,120
Yep, that's clean enough.

484
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,400
I'll clear this out.

485
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,760
All right. We'll go get Oliver.

486
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,200
Are you sure
that you wanna do this?

487
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,560
More than anything.

488
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,520
Yeah.

489
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Your father wouldn't take no
for an answer either.

490
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,400
When I think of
all the stupid stuff we got into

491
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,720
when we were your age,

492
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,680
it's amazing
we didn't get arrested more.

493
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,240
Arrested more?

494
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,280
But you're way smarter than him.
You get that from your mom.

495
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,040
Seems you little ladies had tied
your horse to the wrong saloon.

496
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,680
This mine is off-limits.

497
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,120
I don't care who owns it.
We need to use this pit.

498
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Well...

499
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,920
I'm sure we can come
to an arrangement.

500
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,280
- The mine is ours.
- The hell it is.

501
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,840
I guess you were gonna get
this scar eventually, Hex.

502
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,280
Ease up, cowgirl.

503
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,000
The mine's yours. The mine's yours.

504
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,280
Nice.

505
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,960
So, did you change your mind
about us using the pit, then?

506
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
I miss Ollie too.

507
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Did we miss something?

508
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,920
Just put him in the water.

509
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,680
See for yourself.

510
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,840
I can barely walk,
let alone wear that again.

511
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,680
Do you understand
how many people, how many worlds,

512
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,880
are going to die?

513
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,320
If they're anything like this world,

514
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,720
maybe that's for the best.

515
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,840
How can you even say that?

516
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,240
There was no hope for this world.

517
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,520
That's because you killed Superman.

518
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,840
This guy is not a Paragon
of anything.

519
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,680
I was right.
We can't trust the Monitor.

520
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,440
What did you do?

521
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,960
- Clearly, what you couldn't.
- How was he a threat?

522
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,560
Strange visitor from
another planet comes to Earth

523
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,960
with powers and abilities
far beyond those of mortal men?

524
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
Clark.

525
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,280
Clark always said yes to anyone
with a badge or a flag.

526
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,520
He gave them too much power.

527
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,440
My parents taught me
a very different lesson.

528
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,680
Life only makes sense
if you force it to.

529
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,560
A little souvenir
from the old hometown.

530
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,480
- It's not working.
- Just give it some time.

531
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,040
Guys, Mia's right. This isn't...

532
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,040
- You good?
- Nice one.

533
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Dad.

534
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,640
- You tranq'd him?
- I tranq'd his body.

535
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,200
We still have to get his soul back.

536
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,560
That isn't Oliver yet.

537
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,920
The Kate I knew didn't trust
anyone, let alone a Kryptonian.

538
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,400
I don't know what happened
to you, Bruce, but it ends now.

539
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,280
Yes. Let it end.

540
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,920
Let it all end.

541
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,160
This world's not worth saving
in any universe.

542
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,240
If you really think that,

543
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,120
you're gonna have to kill
one more person. Me.

544
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,120
Don't be a fool.

545
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,280
Don't! It'll kill you.

546
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,760
Kate,

547
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,880
listen to me.

548
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,480
There is no hope.

549
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,920
So, do you have
a gluten sensitivity too?

550
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,720
No, not that I know of.

551
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,800
Congratulations.

552
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,960
You're a ringer
for a filthy Kryptonian.

553
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,160
Mom must be so proud.

554
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,840
Kid was a piece of cake.
There you go.

555
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,720
There's someone I want you to meet.

556
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,240
Hi, there, handsome guy.

557
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,000
He looks just like my son, Jason.

558
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,920
Well done.

559
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,200
You have succeeded in finding
the Paragon of Truth.

560
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,480
Lex Luthor played his role.

561
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,800
- He led you to him.
- Yeah?

562
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,360
How many more people
did he hurt to do that?

563
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,400
You think you're a good guy,
but you're not.

564
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,240
I think he's kind of neat.

565
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,520
Okay. Well, we still only have three.

566
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,680
Bruce Wayne wasn't the Paragon
of anything, so...

567
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,840
Ray, you are looking jacked.

568
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,160
No, no, no.
This is your cousin. Sort of.

569
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,000
Okay. So Batman tried to kill Kara.

570
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,200
And now he's dead, so we're doomed.

571
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,280
We shall see.

572
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,840
I believe Dr. Palmer's work
is now finished.

573
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
At least I think it is.

574
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,520
I've never actually built
a Paragon detector before.

575
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,800
Okay. This'll be the trial run
to find the final three.

576
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,360
Everyone might wanna
take a step back.

577
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,560
- And which Earth is that?
- None of them. It's us.

578
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
This ship.

579
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,520
Apparently,
there are still a few bugs.

580
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,240
Your machine works just fine.

581
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,400
That light is the Paragon of Courage.

582
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,120
Yeah, well, Bruce's body
isn't on the ship, so...

583
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,520
No, but you are.

584
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,720
I said the path to Earth-99
would lead you to the Paragon.

585
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,840
That has come to pass.

586
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,480
You are the bat of the future,
Kate Kane.

587
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,400
You are the Paragon of Courage.

588
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,440
- What?
- Yes. Something's wrong.

589
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,360
This is...
It's never happened before.

590
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,680
With all the antimatter
in the system...

591
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,160
I've lost my magical mojo.

592
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,640
If we can't get Oliver's soul back,

593
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,160
- he's gonna be a monster forever.
- Yeah.

594
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,480
Do these things even work on you?

595
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,560
Not really.

596
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,080
But you looked like you could use
a drinking buddy.

597
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Yeah.

598
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:45,880
Time travelers. Aliens.

599
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,720
I have barely even started
this whole vigilante thing.

600
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,520
How am I a Paragon?

601
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,600
I've seen you in action.

602
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
You saved me.

603
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,640
And last year, you saved
Oliver and Barry's asses.

604
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,760
Thank you very much.

605
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,800
That's accurate.

606
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,840
How much you care,
how hard you try,...

607
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,120
those are the things
that make you a hero.

608
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,640
Not powers or time travel.

609
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,880
And you may not feel like
you have the experience now,

610
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,200
but you have the heart.

611
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,160
You're one of
the bravest people I know.

612
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,320
That Bruce was brave once too.
And he had heart.

613
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,240
What if I end up like him?

614
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,120
You won't.

615
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,400
You'll make your own destiny.

616
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,120
I found this in his library.

617
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,720
That's Beth and me.

618
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,920
From Earth-99.

619
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,960
I wish I knew her like this.

620
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,080
Maybe you still can.

621
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,040
Sounds like the Paragon of Hope
just got her hope back.

622
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,160
No.

623
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,280
Hope, help, and compassion for all.

624
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,480
That's what I'm gonna do
for Earth-38.

625
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,280
- But Earth-38 is gone.
- I know.

626
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,480
But maybe I can use the Book
of Destiny to bring it back.

627
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,600
The Monitor said that would be
really dangerous, Kara.

628
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,680
I know what he said.

629
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,360
But what good is being
the Paragon of Hope

630
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,480
if I don't have any?

631
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,280
Stop. Please, stop.

632
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,240
<i>Come to me, Harbinger.</i>

633
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,440
<i>It is time.</i>

634
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,960
<i>Lyla Michaels.</i>

635
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,800
<i>Harbinger.</i>

636
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,640
<i>I need you.</i>

637
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,200
<i>Who are you?</i>

638
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,760
<i>Universe after universe
has fallen before my power.</i>

639
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,160
<i>World after world consumed.</i>

640
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,560
<i>With every death,</i>

641
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,400
I steal my mirror's strength,
and mine grows ever stronger.

642
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,600
Who am I?

643
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,920
I am the Anti-Monitor.

644
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,480
Come, Harbinger.

645
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,640
There is work to be done.
