1
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,560
<i>Trust me, this isn't the story
I expected to be telling.</i>

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,440
<i>But you know as well as I do</i>

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,000
<i>that stories,
like the people who tell them,</i>

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,720
<i>aren't always what they seem.</i>

5
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,640
Let's take a picture, Beth.

6
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,360
Mom! Wake up! No! Mom!

7
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,280
Batman's here. He's gonna save us!

8
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,400
Batman, where are you going? Wait!

9
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,000
You're leaving us to die!

10
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,520
Beth, grab my hand!

11
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,280
<i>Grab my hand!</i>

12
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,560
- Kate!
- Mom, Beth, no!

13
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,440
- Too slow.
- You covered the damn hole!

14
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,640
And you found way, own way.

15
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,160
Tomorrow,...find faster.

16
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,240
<i>I suppose I should start here
in Gotham.</i>

17
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,760
<i>Three years ago, when Batman
mysteriously disappeared</i>

18
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,400
<i>it divided the city.</i>

19
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,400
<i>Some hoped he'd be back,
others figured he was dead.</i>

20
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,760
<i>I thought he abandoned Gotham</i>

21
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,880
<i>for the same reason
he abandoned my family.</i>

22
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,280
<i>Because he didn't care.</i>

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,720
Keep it on! Keep it on!

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,520
Keep it on!

25
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,040
- Don't turn off the bat signal!
- Keep it on!

26
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,400
Keep it on! Keep it on!

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,040
{\an5}Keep it on! Keep it on!

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,200
{\an5}Keep it on! Keep it on! Keep it on!

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,400
Keep it on! Keep it on!

30
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,720
How cute is this little kid?

31
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,080
Mary, you're embarrassing me.

32
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,560
{\an5}Keep it on! Keep it on! Keep it on!

33
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,560
Excuse me, ma'am.

34
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,320
This isn't beneath you, Commander?

35
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
{\an5}Well, it's the only excuse
I have to see my radiant wife.

36
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,040
<i>Concerned the police
couldn't keep order</i>

37
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,880
<i>in a Gotham without Batman,</i>

38
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,640
<i>my dad started Crows Security.</i>

39
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,360
<i>A private firm
that protects the people</i>

40
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,880
<i>that the Dark Knight left behind.</i>

41
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,240
{\an5}Moore to Crows' nest.
North side's clear.

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,360
<i>How are we out front?</i>

43
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
Perimeter looks good.

44
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,760
What's the word, Vasquez?

45
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,800
- West Side's clear.
<i>- Copy.</i>

46
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,000
{\an5}Let's lock it up.

47
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,760
All right, Dodgson, how much?

48
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,520
Ten thousand bucks a plate
just to watch a light flip off.

49
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,160
Must be nice.

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,000
{\an5}Operational leadership
at its best, Agent Moore.

51
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,400
{\an5}Well, done tonight.

52
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,600
{\an5}<i>My pleasure, sir.</i>

53
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,400
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight is about reality.</i>

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,080
{\an5}Batman gave up on us.

55
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,040
It's been three years, Gotham.

56
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,720
The Bat's not coming back.

57
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,480
{\an5}Mayor Akins, help us say goodbye
to Gotham's outdated tradition.

58
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,640
{\an5}It's time to turn off the signal!

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,640
{\an5}My kid used to stare at this thing

60
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,960
{\an5}through his bedroom window.

61
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,520
{\an5}Now, I got to be the one
to flip it off?

62
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,840
{\an5}Together, I invite you to gaze out

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,840
{\an5}at the Bat-Signal one last time.

64
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
{\an5}Commander Kane, I just lost
our city surveillance.

65
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,960
{\an5}What about the rooftop feed?

66
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,760
- Sir, we're totally blind.
- Something's up.

67
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,360
Eyes everywhere.

68
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,640
We're gonna start
the countdown, Officer.

69
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,160
Copy. Standing by.

70
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,920
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,800
five, four, three, two, one.

72
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,160
Turn the light off, boys.

73
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,440
What's happening?

74
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,640
"Hello," said Alice.

75
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,880
Shall we believe
the Crows will protect us?

76
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,720
Oh, I believed six impossible
things before breakfast.

77
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,040
Do you feel safe
behind these security gates?

78
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,200
Because one of you
won't be going home tonight.

79
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,280
The Crows are not the hero
of this story, Gotham.

80
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,880
<i>Batman couldn't save you
and neither will they.</i>

81
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,960
Get these people out of here now.
Let's go!

82
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,200
- Let's go.
- Mom?

83
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,840
- Jacob, what's happening?
- Get out now.

84
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,160
Agent Moore, do you copy?

85
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,200
<i>Sophie, do you copy?</i>

86
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,320
We got her.

87
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,200
Call for you.

88
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,880
Girl who talk too much.

89
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,440
- Hello?
<i>- Kate? It's Mary.</i>

90
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,560
- Your step-sister?
<i>- Mary,</i>

91
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
our parents have been married
for over a decade,

92
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,840
I know who you are.

93
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,000
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

94
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,800
You have to swear you won't tell
anyone I'm telling you this...

95
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,960
Mary, what happened?

96
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,080
Sophie's missing.

97
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,440
<i>They think someone took her.</i>

98
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,560
<i>I just... I thought you should know.</i>

99
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,320
<i>I had spent years
traveling the world,</i>

100
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,720
<i>training with combat
and survivalist specialists,</i>

101
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,520
<i>so I could join the Crows.</i>

102
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,760
<i>Sophie's disappearance
brought me home early.</i>

103
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,280
<i>I had to find her.</i>

104
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,640
<i>But first, I had to convince
my dad I was ready.</i>

105
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,720
Crows represent order,
security, safety.

106
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,760
These monsters
long for the good old days

107
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,520
when gangs ran around unchecked.

108
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,760
They spread fear by saying,
"Look at us.

109
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,080
If we can get a Crow, we can get
your wife, your kid."

110
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,440
- Where are we on surveillance?
- Afraid it doesn't exist, sir.

111
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,080
If it were any one of you,

112
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,000
Agent Moore would not sleep
until you were found.

113
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,800
{\an5}Let's do the same for her.

114
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,520
Let's bring her home.

115
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Kate.

116
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,880
Hey, Dad.

117
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,720
{\an5}Come here, kiddo.

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,320
{\an5}I didn't add cream,
but please tell me!

119
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,640
{\an5}You kicked that vegan thing, huh?

120
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,320
I wish you called.

121
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,680
- We're gonna find her.
- Then let me help.

122
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,120
Neck tattoo, that's new.

123
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,960
{\an5}Dad, I'm ready to come home
and work for you.

124
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,560
Sir, Mayor's on two.

125
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,440
{\an5}He's talking about canceling
the Movie in the Park.

126
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,720
Tell him I'll be right there.

127
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,000
Do you know who took her?

128
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,680
Ruthless, spineless maniacs,

129
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,120
who frankly don't stand a chance

130
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,640
against a team of ex-Navy SEALs
and Green Berets.

131
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,880
- And what about me?
- You take after your cousin.

132
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,560
You're a female Bruce Wayne.

133
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,520
But unlike him,
you actually have a shot

134
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,440
at making something of your life.

135
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,000
Bruce was the one person
who was actually there for me

136
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,600
after Mom and Beth died.

137
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,280
Let me help The Crows find Sophie.

138
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,920
It's great to see you,
but I gotta take this call.

139
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,920
Oh, we don't get we exposed a
week before graduation.

140
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,440
About that?

141
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,920
How about that after we graduate,

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,480
I take you to the house
for a week alone on a yacht.

143
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,160
But like...

144
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,000
- with the chef?
- Obviously.

145
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,160
Oh, shed, things you have seen.

146
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,840
Defacing school property.

147
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,360
Why not?

148
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,960
Got me to break every other rule.

149
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,280
"Loves."

150
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,080
Bold.

151
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,320
Cadet Captain Kane,

152
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,880
is there something you'd like
to report to your squad?

153
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,080
Not that I'm aware of, sir.

154
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,880
Perhaps you're not aware
of the academy's code of conduct.

155
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,720
<i>I had to find her.</i>

156
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,760
<i>So, I needed to go to the one place</i>

157
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,080
<i>that always seemed to have
the answers,</i>

158
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,920
<i>to the heart of Gotham,</i>

159
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,200
<i>which just happened to have eyes
all over the city.</i>

160
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,520
<i>Bruce isn't in his office. Come on.</i>

161
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,360
<i>Kate, we're not supposed to be
in here.</i>

162
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,320
<i>What's that?</i>

163
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,760
<i>Why does Bruce
have a girl's necklace?</i>

164
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,880
Come on.

165
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,760
No, I don't think we're supposed
to touch that. Come on.

166
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,560
Step away from the desk! Move!

167
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Wayne Security.

168
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,480
Not to tell you how to do
your job, Mister...

169
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,560
Luke.

170
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,680
Luke, but your boss is my cousin.

171
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,400
Think you're the first squatter
I've met related to Bruce Wayne?

172
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,960
How the hell
did you even get in here?

173
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,520
I'm Kate Kane,
I practically grew up here,

174
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,640
and Bruce was like my fun,
irresponsible big brother.

175
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Okay.

176
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,800
- When's his birthday?
- February 19th.

177
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,360
Middle name?

178
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
Trick question. He doesn't have one.

179
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Favorite soup?

180
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,480
Is it weird that you know that?

181
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,320
If you are Bruce's cousin

182
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,960
you know that no one's heard
from him in almost three years.

183
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,280
Hey, yeah.
Luke Fox over at Wayne here.

184
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,640
Got another B and E for you.

185
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
Bruce gave me a great piece
of advice once.

186
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,720
Grow into the person
you needed as a kid.

187
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,640
That's great.
Police are on their way.

188
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
It turns out that the person

189
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,680
that I needed as a kid can do this.

190
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,680
Hey!

191
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,960
Get these handcuffs off me right now.

192
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,400
Password still "Alfred?"

193
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,080
- Hey!
- You might want to change that.

194
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,840
Wait. You can't...

195
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,320
Can you just step away
from the computer, please?

196
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,400
Hey. What are you doing?

197
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,080
What the Crows aren't able to.

198
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,320
Get this thing off me.

199
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,880
Hey, hey.

200
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,840
You can't just...

201
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,800
I see the relation now.

202
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,920
Dad, I think I found something.

203
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,080
Surprise!

204
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Keep us waiting, why don't you?

205
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
- Hi, hey.
- Hi!

206
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,440
- Hi.
- Where's, where's my dad?

207
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,160
No idea because you, me,
cotton candy shots now.

208
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,760
Come on.

209
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,960
So, I'm on the roof

210
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,600
Alice is threatening to kill
literally everybody,

211
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,560
and the first thought that pops
into my brain is,

212
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,800
"Oh, my God, what a bummer.

213
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,280
Now, I'll never be able to read
my future children

214
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,400
<i>Alice In Wonderland</i>.
But then I was like

215
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,080
"Mary, rearranging
your entire life out of fear

216
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,640
is exactly how the terrorists win."

217
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,000
Why did you call me?

218
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,920
I may have found a box
of pictures in your closet

219
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,240
when I was borrowing
your Balenciaga T...

220
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,800
- You know what? Never mind.
- Look. I don't know your drama,

221
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
but we all got a box
of picture somewhere.

222
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,240
I just thought you'd want to be here.

223
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,360
Welcome home, Katie.

224
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,320
I hope you don't mind my making you

225
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,480
the center of attention tonight.

226
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,960
No place I'd rather be.

227
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,080
Then let's make sure
we're posting happy photos

228
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,640
to our social media accounts.

229
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,840
Because why wouldn't this party
have an agenda?

230
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,720
If we feel safe,
then our clients feel safe.

231
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,280
Movie in the Park is Friday,

232
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,760
and it's Gotham's first
public event in three years.

233
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,760
Anyway, the councilwoman
would like a photo, Mary.

234
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,920
Excuse us.

235
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,960
"I hereby deny the below allegation

236
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,760
of homosexual conduct."
Blah...blah...blah.

237
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,560
Kiss my ass.

238
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,960
Guess that's that then.

239
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,920
What do you say we burn these

240
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,240
and scatter the ashes
across the Mediterranean?

241
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,320
I can't.

242
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,880
I'm staying.

243
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,920
You signed it.

244
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,520
I told them what they wanted to hear.

245
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,920
You lied.

246
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,480
I need this school, okay?
I want to be here.

247
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,880
But they don't want you.

248
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,840
Unfortunately,
I don't have the luxury

249
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,080
of being offended by that.

250
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,560
And maybe it's best if you just
kept your distance from now on.

251
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Hey.

252
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,920
I know you love me.

253
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,240
Tell me that I'm wrong,
and I'll walk away

254
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,120
and let you make the biggest
mistake of your life.

255
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,760
You're wrong, Kate.

256
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
I have to go.

257
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Dad, I have something.

258
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,040
Where'd you get this?

259
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,000
Wayne's camera feed
isn't on the Crows' network.

260
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,600
Wayne's defunct.

261
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,080
Not sure how facial rec's
supposed to work here.

262
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,720
They're in masks.

263
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,160
Wait. What does that paddle say?

264
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,800
<i>"Milk, well-behaved, C-H."</i>

265
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,000
"Not for the mild,
well-behaved child."

266
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,440
It was their creepy
disciplinary motto.

267
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,920
- It was whose motto?
- The Burnside Orphanage.

268
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,200
Beth and I used to sneak in there
with our Ouija board

269
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,440
and freak each other out.

270
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,560
That's where they are.

271
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,240
Taylor, get a satellite feed.
I want eyes all over this.

272
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,160
Dodgson, cover
the north entrance with me.

273
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,160
Banks takes his team on the south.

274
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,480
Kate?

275
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,560
Curiouser and curiouser.

276
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,400
Up, up.

277
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,920
I thought you'd been sent away,
but now, you seem to be here.

278
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,320
How do you know me?

279
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,000
Better now.

280
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,960
Where's Sophie?

281
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,840
Gone. And just in time,

282
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,040
because I am not used to being found.

283
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,640
Clever girl.

284
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,040
If you didn't want an audience,
I'd be dead.

285
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,440
So, what do you want?

286
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,600
I need you to send
your father a message.

287
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,520
He thinks he's Gotham's white knight,

288
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,160
but he's a bully whose army
bullies this city into obedience,

289
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,240
and I want the world to know
that he doesn't scare me.

290
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:54,160
I want to take away his power.

291
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,840
Then take me and let Sophie go.

292
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,280
Oh, dear. This is quite sad actually.

293
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,800
You poor thing.

294
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,040
You haven't figured it out yet.

295
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,920
I took Sophie

296
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,560
because she'll actually get
his attention.

297
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Your father doesn't want you, Kate.

298
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,920
He shipped you away,

299
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,760
and you show up
without the proper postage.

300
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,800
I assumed you knew.

301
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,560
But then again,

302
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,480
you have been so busy

303
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,680
trying to convince him to love you,

304
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,160
you sweet,... pathetic girl.

305
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,920
Sophie is the daughter
your father always wanted,

306
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,560
not you, dear.

307
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,720
Who the hell are you?

308
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,440
Right. I'm Alice.

309
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,640
How do you do?

310
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,400
Dodgson, what do you got?

311
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,160
- Just missed them, sir.
- Where's Kate?

312
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,120
Found her bike stashed
in some bushes,

313
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,280
but no sign of her.

314
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,520
What do you mean no sign of her?

315
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,480
Where am I?

316
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,720
Hi...

317
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,640
And don't kill me.

318
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,520
What is this place?

319
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,400
This is my humble,
little illegal clinic

320
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,720
Gotham University has generously
and unknowingly lent me.

321
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,440
Hey, hey, Mr. Whittaker.

322
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,640
We're gonna have to keep that on,
okay?

323
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,280
We talked about this, remember?

324
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,440
Got to keep that on.

325
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,040
Can we be done with this? I got to...

326
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,520
Hang on. I was mid-stitch.

327
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,040
How did you find me?

328
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,840
Someone dumped you at the door.
One of my guys brought you in.

329
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,000
You have guys?

330
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,840
So I swear this began with me
offering water and Band-Aids,

331
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,080
and the next thing you know,

332
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
I'm the Meredith Grey
of Sherwood Forest.

333
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,160
I'm sorry if stealing from my med
school makes me a bad person.

334
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,120
It doesn't.

335
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,640
It actually makes you deeper
than I thought.

336
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,200
Thanks.

337
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,440
Done.

338
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,080
Keep your ear to the street,

339
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,080
and if you hear anything
about Sophie, call.

340
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,240
Yeah.

341
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,680
I was right.

342
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,880
Alice was there,
and wherever they went,

343
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,400
it's probably not far.

344
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,920
Where the hell have you been?

345
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,440
We thought she took you too.

346
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,400
I got half my guys out there
looking for you!

347
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,720
And here I am telling you

348
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,360
her vendetta isn't against Gotham,

349
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,120
isn't against the Crows,
but against you.

350
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,080
- Why?
- You are not listening.

351
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,520
You ran into an unknown
terrorist cell

352
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,720
without proper backup.

353
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,000
If you treated me
like everybody else,

354
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,920
- I would have had backup.
- Except you're not everyone else.

355
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,360
No, I'm not.

356
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,080
I never will be...

357
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,160
Because no matter what I do
trying to prove myself to you,

358
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,520
you don't want me.

359
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,360
What did I tell you

360
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,200
after you got expelled
from the Academy?

361
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,360
Kate, I love you.

362
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,120
I wouldn't want you any other way.

363
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,880
I remember what you said
because it was right

364
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,840
before you sent me away
to train for a job

365
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,000
that you were never gonna give me.

366
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,560
I was giving you a second chance.

367
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,800
You were getting rid of me.

368
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,080
Because when you look at me,
you see Beth,

369
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,600
and when you see Beth, you see mom.

370
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,200
And instead of dealing with it,

371
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,680
you spent the last 15 years
pushing me away.

372
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,720
You win, Dad.

373
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,640
I'm gone.

374
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,280
Kate.

375
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,640
Hey, hey, hey.
How did you even get in...

376
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,960
I know you know where Bruce is.

377
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,520
Call him and tell him
that I am looking for someone.

378
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,040
- I have no idea where he is.
- That was me asking nicely.

379
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,720
Okay,
if Bruce wanted to come home...

380
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,840
He would, he would for me.

381
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,960
Okay.

382
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,240
Someone moved that.

383
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,400
How the hell would you know?

384
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,040
It was my Aunt Martha's.

385
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,200
She was wearing it the night

386
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,680
that she and my Uncle Thomas
were killed,

387
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,360
but he always kept it here.

388
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,920
Look.

389
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,440
You... You don't want to do that.
I mean, it looks really old.

390
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,000
Probably not even up to code,
if it even works.

391
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,560
You are seriously not supposed
to know what's down there.

392
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,880
So I have this thing with rules...

393
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,160
Bruce Wayne is Batman.

394
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,000
Yeah, I'm dead.

395
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,040
<i>The Bruce I knew
had a million secrets</i>

396
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,040
<i>and now I know why
they were kept from me.</i>

397
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,400
Let's take a picture, Beth. Make
sure our necklaces are in it.

398
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,720
There. Ready? Cheese!

399
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,760
What is this guy doing?

400
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,280
Beth, are you okay?
We're gonna go over!

401
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,440
Batman's here. He's gonna save us!

402
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,160
He spent years trying to figure out

403
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,480
what went wrong that day.

404
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,600
He knew the car was gonna go over,

405
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,800
so he shot two hooks,

406
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,360
each with a safe load of one ton.

407
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,240
The weight, the angle,

408
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,240
he was so sure he secured the car.

409
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Go, Kate! Hurry! Get out!

410
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,000
Where are you going, Batman? Wait!

411
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,040
Wake up now! Mom, please!

412
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,160
Beth, you need to grab my hand now!

413
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,680
Kate!

414
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,200
Grab my hand!

415
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,600
No!

416
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,600
Beth! No!

417
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,240
Mom! Beth!

418
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,720
The steel in the trunk
still ripped away.

419
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,000
It was crappy engineering.

420
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,640
It was the one calculation
he didn't make.

421
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,960
I grew up thinking
that Batman cared more

422
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,400
about getting the bad guy than...

423
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,200
The lives of innocent people.

424
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,320
No, he cared.

425
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,800
He saved 34 kids that day.

426
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,720
He thought he saved your mom
and sister too.

427
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,160
I mean, his only living family,
and he got it wrong.

428
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,880
Haunted the hell out of him.

429
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Yeah, don't push that.

430
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
No. Okay.

431
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,440
Not about to get myself fired
twice by Batman, so...

432
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,440
Find your own way.

433
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,960
- What?
- That's why Bruce became Batman,

434
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,920
to play by his own rules.

435
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,040
It made him terrifying
to his enemies.

436
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,920
Yeah, and his friends
and his co-workers.

437
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,520
- We really need to go.
- People aren't afraid anymore.

438
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,400
An army may not scare them...

439
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,480
but that will.

440
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,760
I need you to fix his suit.

441
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,640
The suit is literal perfection.

442
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,840
It will be...

443
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,360
When it fits a woman.

444
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,320
- Mary.
- We found one of Alice's guys.

445
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,160
I think I know
where they took Sophie.

446
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,880
Come on this way.

447
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,560
I don't like that building.

448
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,200
- Who's covering it?
- That'd be Dodgson, sir.

449
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,200
Dodgson.

450
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,840
I love it.

451
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,200
Have fun.

452
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
You, too.

453
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,640
Traitor! Don't!

454
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,800
Don't!

455
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,960
Commander.

456
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,240
Dare I say Gotham is looking
a little like the good, old days.

457
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,440
Sorry, I had my doubts.

458
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,160
City trusts us for a reason, Mayor.

459
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,640
Enjoy the movie, excuse me. Kane.

460
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,800
I haven't missed the show, have I?

461
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,480
Now, you tell me where you are,

462
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,680
and then I'll dump you
at Arkham myself.

463
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,840
We're all mad here, Commander.

464
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,640
I'm mad, you're mad.

465
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,840
Sanity is so pedestrian.

466
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,760
<i>I want to be memorable,</i>

467
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,200
<i>the kind of girl who never
leaves your thoughts,</i>

468
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,000
<i>so I took it upon myself</i>

469
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,600
<i>to fill a Crows' truck
with forget-me-nots.</i>

470
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,760
How do you like the Queen,
said the cat?

471
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,760
These are families. Kids.

472
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,040
Then keep your mouth shut
and everyone will stay alive

473
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,160
to see how this boring movie ends.

474
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,680
Try anything, and boom.

475
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,160
<i>Look up.</i>

476
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,920
<i>You'd never forget about Sophie,
would you, Commander?</i>

477
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,120
<i>Your favorite little birdie
up in the sky,</i>

478
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,760
but, oh dear, oh my,
can your little birdie fly?

479
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,480
For if she moves an inch, she'll die.

480
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,360
Pick one, Commander.
Sophie or Gotham.

481
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,120
Why are you doing this?

482
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,560
Why is a raven like a writing desk?

483
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,760
Who's there?

484
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,480
I thought you were dead.

485
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,160
Simple math, barrel weighs 500lb.

486
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,400
Birdie weighs a quarter of that.

487
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,640
Once barrel weighs
less than birdie...

488
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,560
No.

489
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,240
No.

490
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,600
No.

491
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,680
You're...

492
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,240
Not him.

493
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,480
Mommy, look.

494
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,840
It's Batman!

495
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,680
<i>Good morning, Gotham.</i>

496
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,640
<i>Your girl Vesper Fairchild here.</i>

497
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,080
<i>So was I dreaming,
or is Batman really back?</i>

498
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,720
<i>If so, things are looking up
for this city.</i>

499
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,040
<i>If not, I just revealed
way too much about my dreams.</i>

500
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,280
<i>Talk to me, Gotham.</i>

501
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,800
<i>Are you as excited
about Mr. Tall, Dark</i>

502
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,360
<i>and Unavailable as I am?</i>

503
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,800
It was so cool, and then Batman
flew into the sky

504
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,120
and was swinging from buildings.

505
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,040
See? I told you he'd be back.

506
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,200
Dodgson and Alice
are Crows' priority number one.

507
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,080
- What about the Bat, sir?
- Oh, come on.

508
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,200
Seen these wannabes before.

509
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,120
He gets the city all hot
and bothered,

510
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,640
and then thanks
to a total lack of skill,

511
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,280
he usually dies
in some spectacular fashion.

512
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,720
He?

513
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,240
Welcome back, Agent Moore.
You say something?

514
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,160
- Not important, sir.
- All right.

515
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,640
Let's find these two.

516
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,400
Wouldn't drink that if I were you.

517
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,280
It's toxic.

518
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,240
Christmas gift from Gotham police.

519
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,880
Good to know.

520
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,920
Hi, by the way.

521
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Hi.

522
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,560
I heard you came back for me.

523
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,640
Thanks.

524
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,320
There she is,
I thought we talked about

525
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,040
never letting you out
of my sight again.

526
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,240
I'm fine. Seriously, I'm good.

527
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,960
Tyler, this is Kate.

528
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,160
Kate, Tyler works
for Crows International.

529
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,800
Sorry to barge in,
but got in late last night,

530
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,320
and now I am that annoyingly
overprotective husband.

531
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,440
You're married.

532
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah.

533
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,640
Congratulations.

534
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,160
Nice to meet you, Tyler.

535
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,400
I should probably go.

536
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,400
See you, Sophie.

537
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,160
Figured you'd left town.

538
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,760
I want you to tell me
that I was right.

539
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,440
You were never going
to make me a Crow.

540
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,880
You're right.

541
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,240
I never wanted you to be a Crow.

542
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,320
The Military was my dream for you.

543
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,640
I'd call in a favor,
get you a desk job, a staff,

544
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,960
and the occasional papercut

545
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,960
would be the only bloodshed
you'd ever see.

546
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,320
- That wasn't my dream.
- No.

547
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,720
No, you wanted to be in the action.

548
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,600
That's why I didn't want you
to be a Crow

549
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,040
because I'm selfish
and overly protective...

550
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,840
And I'm terrified,

551
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,200
and because
you're all I have left, Kate.

552
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,200
And I don't want to lose you, too.

553
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,480
Look, this is all my way
of saying that if...

554
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,160
If you want to be part of the team...

555
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,200
You're in.

556
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,400
<i>My dad was running from his pain,</i>

557
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,160
<i>but I was running, too,</i>

558
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,760
<i>toward everything
that didn't want me,</i>

559
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,240
<i>a military academy,
a private army, my own father.</i>

560
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,520
<i>I spent 15 years searching
for a place I fit,</i>

561
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,240
<i>and I think I've finally found it.</i>

562
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,200
<i>Some see fear, others hope.</i>

563
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,520
<i>I see the freedom to be myself,
to play by my own rules.</i>

564
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,040
<i>I believe you're going
to come home one day, Bruce,</i>

565
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,520
<i>and before you kill me</i>

566
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,480
<i>for borrowing a few of your things,</i>

567
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,920
<i>I want you to read my story
because it's only just begun.</i>

568
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,480
<i>Miss you. Your cousin, Kate.</i>

569
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,320
You know, for a minute there,
really felt like he was home.

570
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,280
Hey, look, for what it's worth,

571
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,680
Bruce never stopped looking
for your sister's body.

572
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,560
It is worth more than you think.

573
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,080
Guy had the best tech on the planet.

574
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,840
Why didn't he find her?

575
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,840
<i>Make sure our necklaces are in it.</i>

576
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,600
Beth.

577
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,440
<i>I'll win you over, my dear sister.</i>

578
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,720
<i>The two of us will rule Gotham...</i>

579
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,520
<i>Together.</i>
