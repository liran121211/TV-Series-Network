1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,360
All there.

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,680
Used, unmarked bills, as promised.

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,040
Congratulations.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,280
You're now, the new proud owner
of seven hearts,

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,560
14 kidneys,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,400
seven livers, 14 lungs...

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,680
and 14 corneas.

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,000
Some disassembly required.

9
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Get her, get her!

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Where'd she go?

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,320
She's over there,
she went that way. Go, go!

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Get her!

13
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm just saying,
like a braid could help.

14
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,200
I am not wearing a braid.

15
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,120
Congratulations!

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,280
On behalf of the medical profession,
both licensed and unlicensed,

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,080
I'd like to offer my sincerest

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,760
"what up" on shutting down
that chop shop.

19
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,840
I wasn't sure how you
guys celebrated.

20
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,800
Usually by icing my knuckles.

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
So, this is what a victory
lap looks like.

22
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,920
Trafficker got away.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,960
{\an5}Some asshat yanked my wig,
almost pulled off my cowl.

24
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,760
{\an5}Who could've predicted that
30,000 strands of grab-me red hair

25
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,720
{\an5}would be like waving
a flag in front of a bull?

26
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,440
What if you ran an electrical charge
through the cowl

27
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,160
{\an5}so the next person
who tried to get grabby

28
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,640
{\an5}would have 10,000 volts
of "hands off"?

29
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,720
{\an5}As much as I love the thought
of wrapping my head in lightning...

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,960
{\an5}Right. Dumb.

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,080
{\an5}I've had a few of these. Withdrawn.

32
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,480
{\an5}We will celebrate.

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,840
{\an5}As soon as we get this
organ-selling creep behind bars.

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Okay.

35
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,240
{\an5}Well, go Bat-team.

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,560
{\an5}Which I am not on.

37
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,200
Taking the champagne.

38
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,040
{\an5}Backing away.

39
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,080
{\an5}The cowl shock thing,
not the worst idea.

40
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,000
{\an5}She wants to be part of this
and the answer is no.

41
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,440
{\an5}She doesn't wanna be part of this
as much as she wants

42
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,080
{\an5}to be part of your life.

43
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,880
Then I will take her out for dinner.

44
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,640
{\an5}We need to focus on
your dad's journal.

45
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,640
{\an5}If that thing really is the cookbook

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
{\an5}of Wayne Enterprise's
best-kept secrets

47
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,200
{\an5}we need to find
where Tommy Elliot hid it.

48
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,720
So, where do we start?

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,040
{\an5}Whichever aisle has the property
seized from Tommy Elliot.

50
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,760
{\an5}Of course, Tommy collected like
every Kitty Delgado comic.

51
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,600
Oh, my God.

52
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,680
Well, there's no way a cat burglar's
squeezing into all

53
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,040
those tight spaces
with those jubblies.

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,200
{\an5}So, if I were the smoking gun

55
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,800
{\an5}that links Tommy Elliot
to the murder of Lucius Fox

56
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,400
{\an5}- where would I be?
- I don't know, love.

57
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,480
{\an5}But I hope the Crows pay overtime.

58
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,240
{\an5}I'll settle for hazard pay.

59
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,800
Tell me you found that journal.

60
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,560
{\an5}We've gone through the entire place,

61
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,840
{\an5}which is basically a shrine
to his twig and berries.

62
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,600
But, alas, no Lucius Fox journal.

63
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,960
The guy owned at least 40 buildings
in Gotham alone.

64
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,000
Who knows where he
could've stashed it?

65
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,240
{\an5}Well, there is one person who knows.

66
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,800
{\an5}Candy Kane.

67
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,560
{\an5}Why, your real estate business
must really be tanking

68
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,440
{\an5}if you were willing to let them frisk
you for quite a few how-to's.

69
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,560
{\an5}Believe it or not, Tommy boy,
I'm not here for a measuring contest.

70
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
That's too bad.

71
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,080
Speaking of being the bigger man...

72
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,360
have you heard from Bruce?

73
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,920
Visiting hours are four days a week,
he's total no-show.

74
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,240
Is that any way
to treat your best friend?

75
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
It is.

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
If you killed his actual best friend,
Lucius Fox.

77
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,200
That's an outrageous lie.

78
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,840
Lucius was never Bruce's best friend.

79
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,240
Of course, that would be
your take away.

80
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,160
What did Lucius Fox ever do

81
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
for Bruce?

82
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,320
You mean besides
turning Wayne R&D

83
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
into the world leader
in defense technology?

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,760
Oh, but you already knew that.

85
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,720
That's why you had him killed.

86
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,240
For his journal.

87
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
You wanted the keys
to the candy store.

88
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,400
Where's the journal now, Tommy?

89
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
I miss...

90
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,000
I miss my mommy!

91
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,360
Can I talk to her?

92
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,880
That's okay, Tommy.

93
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,040
The guy you hired to pull the
trigger, he's had a lot to say.

94
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,080
Thanks for stopping by, double K.

95
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,520
And tell your cousin,
the bells are on!

96
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,480
It's fine, thank you.

97
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,360
Get out of my cell.

98
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,880
But yours is so much
roomier than mine.

99
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,240
And there's going to be a vacancy

100
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,440
when they strap you
to the electric chair

101
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,920
for murdering Lucius Fox.

102
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, but Alice, haven't you heard?

103
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,040
I'm crazy, a hundred percent
unfit to stand trial.

104
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,360
Not anymore, I'm afraid.

105
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,920
I got a call this morning
from a judge asking my opinion

106
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,720
in regards to your fitness
to stand trial.

107
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,440
As Arkham's chief medical officer,
I could hardly lie.

108
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,800
So, the Crows will be
here soon to collect you.

109
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,720
But we can help you.

110
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,640
Why...

111
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,120
would you help me?

112
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,640
Because you're gonna help us.

113
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:35,400
I couldn't help but listen in
to your little visit with Kate Kane.

114
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,280
Because when my sister
wants something,

115
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,520
I want it more.

116
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,880
What's so special about the dearly
departed Lucius Fox's journal?

117
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,320
- Just between us bad guys.
- I'm sorry.

118
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,160
Are you two working together?

119
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,920
What's going on here?

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,160
You can answer
the question voluntarily...

121
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,520
or we will extract it.

122
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,720
Supposedly, it's a fail-safe...

123
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,600
to kill the Bat if the suit
ever got into the wrong hands.

124
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,720
Why is Bruce Wayne's R&D guy
telling dear diary about that?

125
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,680
Because Bruce Wayne is Batman.

126
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,200
"Curiouser and curiouser."

127
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,920
And now, I want to know all the more.

128
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,000
Where is the book?

129
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,640
I'm just debating...

130
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
It should I hand it over to...

131
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,440
Gotham's most prolific killer

132
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,880
for nothing in return?

133
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Give us the journal
and we will let you walk out of here.

134
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,160
Really?

135
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,200
Well, just out on to the street where
every wanted poster will have my...

136
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
face on it?

137
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,640
Not if we get you a new one.

138
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,440
This is what it's like bartering
with a psychopath.

139
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,200
We can make you into anyone
you want to be.

140
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,320
Real, imagined.

141
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,040
Whoever your little heart desires.

142
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,600
So, do we have a deal?

143
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,320
You called it. Whatever you said
must have rattled Tommy's cage.

144
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,760
Twenty-two minutes
since you left Arkham

145
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,680
and there's already an
outgoing call to...

146
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,800
- Address says The Lookout.
- Isn't that Johnny Sabatino's club?

147
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,160
Technically, but Tommy
owns the building.

148
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,680
Sabatino's been laundering
Tommy's money through

149
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,280
their club for years.

150
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,520
That is one posh laundromat.

151
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
<i>Tommy, how's the padded palace,
buddy?</i>

152
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,200
<i>Hoping to make it a distant memory.</i>

153
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,640
<i>Listen, remember that item
I had you hold onto?</i>

154
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,800
What, the one you had me break into

155
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,840
your office to get the
night you were arrested?

156
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,080
<i>No idea what you're talking about.</i>

157
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,440
Oh, yeah, it's still here.

158
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,320
Living rent-free.

159
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,840
<i>Well, it's time for it to come home.</i>

160
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,160
Understood, I'll be in touch
to work out the details.

161
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,720
Well, at least we know
where the journal is.

162
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,040
Yeah, at the very high floor
of a mob-infested nightclub.

163
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,440
How would you like
to infiltrate that?

164
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,800
By walking through
the front door.

165
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,920
Wait. You feel that?

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,560
Nope. Feeling nothing.
What is happening?

167
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,240
I think you feel it.
I think you feel it.

168
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,360
- Okay.
- We're...

169
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,280
- going clubbing?
- We're going clubbing.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,920
Okay, so these are all the finalists,
because they deliver on the

171
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,880
and Bat-gadget concealment.

172
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,000
Because we wanna hide the goods,
but not hide the goods.

173
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,960
You feel me?
Okay, the goal is to blend in.

174
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,040
Yeah, but at this place,
standing out is blending in.

175
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
I mean, The Lookout
is the hottest club in Gotham.

176
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,560
No offense to your bar, it's...
It's more of a lounge.

177
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,440
And fortunately, your Bat-boots
are both functional and on trend.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,440
What's in that one?

179
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,080
Oh, that is mine.

180
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,240
Check it.

181
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,160
How insane is this?

182
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,280
Oh, but if you wanna
wear it instead, you can.

183
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,880
You're not going, Mary.

184
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,120
- What?
- I'm sorry, it's too dangerous.

185
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,880
Dangerous? I've been poisoned,
stabbed and nearly exsanguinated.

186
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,280
And the fact that I lived to use
that word as a verb is proof

187
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,720
that I can look out for myself.

188
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,480
That place will be filled
with mobsters.

189
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,840
Which is why you need backup.

190
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,040
I already have it.

191
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,760
I thought there weren't any more
spots on the Bat-team.

192
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,560
Oh, I'm just an honorary member,
love.

193
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,080
The Crows plucked her from the SRR.
She's literally trained for this.

194
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,720
Seriously, it's nothing personal.

195
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,600
And thank you so much
for all of this.

196
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,280
Sounds like Soph's on her way
to arrest Tommy Elliot.

197
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,200
Good for Soph.

198
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,840
Yeah. With Robles's confession,

199
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,360
they're charging Tommy
with Lucius Fox's murder.

200
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,560
Luke will be glad to hear that.

201
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,320
Is all official Crow's business
conducted using hamburger emojis?

202
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,360
It's a cheeseburger.

203
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,920
She wanted to see
if I was out celebrating.

204
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,240
You never mentioned
she was a burger connoisseur.

205
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,400
Don't bother trying to convince her
that kimchi is the best topping.

206
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
I've already taken that hill.

207
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
It's her new favorite.

208
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
When?

209
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
What do you mean?

210
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,360
When did you find time
to take on that hill?

211
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,160
Don't you two have, like,
work or something?

212
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,520
All we do is work, love.

213
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,040
Between the late hours
and all the stress with her mum,

214
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,000
let's just say greasy food's
her best mate right now.

215
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Her mom?

216
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,320
Yeah, she came out to her mum.

217
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Seriously?

218
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,200
Gravely serious, I'm afraid.

219
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,520
Mum's not talking to her.
Soph's a right mess.

220
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,600
Good evening, party crashers.

221
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,600
Tuxedo One, you have a date
with the utility hub one level down.

222
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,080
Red One, there's an employee
bathroom on the north end.

223
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,600
Could be a good place
for a wardrobe change.

224
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,760
- Copy that.
- 10-4.

225
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,480
<i>The classic way that you move</i>

226
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,720
<i>Ok, ok now you've got my attention</i>

227
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,400
<i>Can't take my eye off of you</i>

228
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
Kate?

229
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Reagan?

230
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,680
- Hi.
- What're you doing here?

231
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,440
Don't you have a club
of your own now?

232
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm checking out the
competition.

233
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,840
Promise not to tell your boss?

234
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,800
Only if you let me make you a drink
on the house.

235
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,160
If you promise not to tell my boss.

236
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,600
- Deal.
- I actually stopped by

237
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,560
The Hold Up a couple of times.

238
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
I was hoping...

239
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,920
I don't know. Maybe
I would run into you.

240
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,840
I don't really oversee the
day-to-day.

241
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,240
Too busy?

242
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah. I remember.

243
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,160
At the risk of sounding
even more stalkery,

244
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,720
I've been following
your real estate endeavors.

245
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,360
Buying up property around Bennet Park
and actually lowering the rents?

246
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,640
This city could use a
lot more Kate Kane.

247
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Cheers.

248
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,560
Cheers.

249
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,920
- This is really good.
- It's called an...

250
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,680
"I sort of thought
you'd fight harder to win me back

251
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,040
and I've regretted
walking away ever since."

252
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,520
That is very specific.

253
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,720
Any chance you know how to make
a "Kate Kane is a total idiot"?

254
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,000
<i>You ask her to make a
"What the hell are you doing"?</i>

255
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,720
<i>You have a mission to complete.</i>

256
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Is your ear okay?

257
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,920
It's fine.

258
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,120
Can you hear that
annoying whining sound?

259
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,640
<i>Hilarious.</i>

260
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
No, I don't.

261
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,480
I'm gonna get an Advil.

262
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Okay.

263
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,960
Smooth.

264
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,880
I'm not talking to you.

265
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,280
<i>Tuxedo One, you still talking to me?</i>

266
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,960
I'm here. Found the controls.

267
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Intense. Johnny really likes
keeping tabs on his clientele.

268
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,440
But his office is completely empty.

269
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,640
I'm thinking it's time
for lights out.

270
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
Is it a power outage?

271
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,600
Hey!

272
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
Bloody hell.

273
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,760
Bloody hell.

274
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
I'm made.

275
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,600
We got a problem. Julia's been
grabbed. I think this is a trap.

276
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,320
<i>The building's schematics
shows a wall safe.</i>

277
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
<i>I'm betting it's in there.</i>

278
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,280
Or it's just sitting on his desk.

279
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,440
<i>Awfully important book
to just leave lying around.</i>

280
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,840
<i>Kate? Kate, come in! Kate?</i>

281
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,120
Mr. Elliot's cell is 243.

282
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,640
<i>Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall</i>

283
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,760
<i>All the kings horses
and all the king's men</i>

284
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,080
<i>Couldn't put Humpty
together again</i>

285
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,760
But he was an egg.

286
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,440
And never should've been sitting
on that wall in the first place

287
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,280
and honestly, what were a bunch
of horses gonna do?

288
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,000
When do I get my face?

289
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,440
As soon as I get that journal.

290
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,560
And it's not just a face,
Tommy, it's a whole new you.

291
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,960
What's the deal with the other one?

292
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,360
Mary Poppins says she works for SRR.

293
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,680
A little out of her zip code.

294
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,320
Talk to our guys across the pond,
see if she's worth anything.

295
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
Take her in the back.

296
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,680
And let's put the word out
to the families.

297
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,440
We're auctioning off Batwoman
to the highest bidder.

298
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,360
Winner gets to cure Gotham
of its bat problem.

299
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,440
Yeah. You got it, boss.

300
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,680
What do you mean they caught her?

301
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,720
What happened to your member of
the Special Reconnaissance Regiment?

302
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,560
Turns out that I'm not good...

303
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,120
I didn't call you for a Yelp review,
Mary. I need you on the comms.

304
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,720
- Monitoring the cameras for me.
- What?

305
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,280
I'm going in to save Kate and Julia.

306
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,720
Going in as what?
Sabatino's accountant?

307
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,160
No offense, this is not gonna
get you past the bouncer.

308
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
It has to be me.

309
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,120
Okay, no offense, but you're insane.

310
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,120
I know Sabatino's cousin.
I pumped her stomach when she OD'd.

311
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,200
She owes me one. She can get
me face time with her cousin.

312
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,440
And then what? Ask him nicely?
Offer to tag his club in your Insta?

313
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,920
You sound like Kate.

314
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,720
Because she's right, Mary.
It's too dangerous.

315
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,160
Case in point, she was
just apprehended.

316
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,080
- What's the Bat-protocol here, Luke?
- I don't know.

317
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,960
I don't know.

318
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,480
All I do know is that I really
wish my dad were here

319
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,800
because he would
know what to do.

320
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,880
But he's not.

321
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,960
Because he died protecting
that journal,

322
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,440
now, Kate and Julia
might do the same

323
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,600
and I cannot add you
to that list.

324
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,360
Look, I know no one trusts me
to pull this off,

325
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,640
but I trust you to keep me safe.

326
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay.

327
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,600
Fine. Then you're gonna need
some Bat-accessories.

328
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,960
Don't worry. They go with everything.

329
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Tomcat.

330
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,640
Hey, man, thanks,

331
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,520
for giving me the need-to-know
on our uninvited guests,

332
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,080
but I gotta ask,

333
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,360
how'd you know, Batwoman would
be coming for the journal?

334
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,200
Well, I have friends in low places.

335
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,400
- Yeah, that I know.
- The Bat's been

336
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,280
a thorn in my bottom line
for too long.

337
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,240
- Can't wait to clip her wings.
- Oh, well, you enjoy that, buddy.

338
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,440
- Where's the journal?
- Yeah, see, here's the thing.

339
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,280
If that book was so important
that the Bat-baby wanted it,

340
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,440
thinking that you
undersold me on its value.

341
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,880
<i>- So, I'm gonna hang on to it.</i>
- Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

342
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,720
Don't be a dick.

343
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,000
Tommy, your accounts
are frozen, you're on ice.

344
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,960
Can you blame me
for giving you the cold shoulder?

345
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,600
Take care of yourself, buddy.

346
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,000
That son of a bitch was
like a brother to me!

347
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,400
Clearly, you are an only child.

348
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,320
Otherwise, you'd know that
our dearest siblings

349
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,320
are the ones most
predisposed to betray us.

350
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,360
Why aren't you more upset?

351
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,400
Considering you won't be getting the
journal you so desperately want.

352
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,280
You should be more careful
who you trust.

353
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,480
If you can't trust a money launderer,
who can you trust?

354
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,600
No one.

355
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,560
I only trust in the fact
that people can't be trusted.

356
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,960
So, you knew that Johnny
was gonna betray me?

357
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,480
No.

358
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,360
I just didn't trust him not to.

359
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,520
Well, congratulations,
Alice, you were right.

360
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,640
But you still don't have the book.

361
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,920
I have a contingency. You see...

362
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,480
I released a rare bird
from her cage here at Arkham.

363
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,640
Gotham's most notorious
feather-clad klepto.

364
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,880
The chick who thinks
she's a myna bird?

365
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,560
She prefers to be called Magpie.

366
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,240
<i>Dance for me, dance for me
Dance for me oh, oh, oh</i>

367
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,280
Vodka. Venti.

368
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,160
Woman after my own heart.

369
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,480
Sure that's the best idea?

370
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
Aria!

371
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,040
Hi.

372
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,080
I'm... not placing you.

373
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,640
Oh, picture me upside down,
holding a bedpan of your puke.

374
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,080
- Oh, my god. Mary, hi!
- Hi!

375
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,000
<i>Okay, I'm impressed.</i>

376
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,760
What are you doing here?

377
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,080
I was actually looking for
your cousin.

378
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,120
Oh, cousin Johnny? He's just
in a super intense meeting right now.

379
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,800
Oh, I know, with a bunch of his...

380
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,280
<i>Do not say crime families.</i>

381
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,000
- Mafia bros.
- Mafia?

382
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,360
- Yeah. You're dead.
- Or his frat bros or something?

383
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,240
I don't know,
but he texted me 911 with typos.

384
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,120
Issues with embarrassing
nosebleeds from the...

385
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Oh! Say no more.

386
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,360
Let me see what I can do.

387
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,000
Sweating through this
dress right now.

388
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,480
<i>You're doing awesome.</i>

389
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,040
Sold to Vasily Kosov.

390
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,400
You are the proud owner
of Batwoman's very own grappling gun.

391
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,080
All right, now,
onto the final item of the night

392
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
and let's face it,
the reason you're all here.

393
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,320
Give you the Scarlet Knight herself.

394
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,520
We will start the bidding
at two million dollars.

395
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,080
Two million, do I have two
and a half?

396
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,040
How about three million?

397
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,040
- Come on, do I have four?
- Ten million dollars.

398
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,560
So, who are you supposed to be?

399
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,440
The Bat's sidekick?

400
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,920
I'm gonna tell you
what I told you nine punches ago.

401
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,280
I'm not with Batwoman.

402
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,160
I'm with the Special
Reconnaissance Regiment.

403
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,680
That's interesting.

404
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,680
Because I just got off the phone
with our contact at the SRR.

405
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,080
He says you haven't been under
their employ for the past six months.

406
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,200
Something about going rogue

407
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,080
and betraying the
organization's trust.

408
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Now...

409
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,600
let's start fresh.

410
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
Shall we?

411
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,240
Who are you really working for?

412
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,560
This is a surprise.

413
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,840
Usually when they say I have a
visitor, it's followed by the words,

414
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
"Just kidding."

415
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,280
And a lot of laughter at my expense.

416
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,320
You're the one who put yourself
in here, Alice, not me.

417
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,000
Technically, if we're
splitting hairs,

418
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,240
Kate shoved me into the cell

419
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,440
and you helped lock the door,

420
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,200
but whatever lets you sleep at night.

421
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,160
Tommy Elliot just hanged himself.

422
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,640
Or that's what it was
made to look like.

423
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,080
Do you know anything about that?

424
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,240
Now, what do I know?

425
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,720
I know, I don't give two hoots
about Tommy Elliot!

426
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,920
I know I don't have any
motivation to help you.

427
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,760
And I know, it is impossible
for one to heal from the trauma

428
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,960
of being locked in a cage
when one is still locked in a cage!

429
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:09,040
How many times did you tell me
that Beth was never coming back?

430
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,600
This is me admitting
that you were right.

431
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,440
Do you know what they do
to patients in here?

432
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,920
They put electrodes on our heads

433
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,600
and blast us with so much electricity
that we seize.

434
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,280
And I don't know the exact
science, but...

435
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,880
after about 10 jolts...

436
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,080
let me tell you...

437
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,200
you start convincing
everyone around you that it worked.

438
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,320
I'm sorry... that it ended up
this way.

439
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,120
If you mean that...

440
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,960
Then get me out of here.

441
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
I can't.

442
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,520
I have to protect the daughters
that I have left.

443
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,240
The thing they don't tell you
about ECT is that...

444
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,280
once it's over...

445
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,400
all that's left is clarity.

446
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,240
I see everything now.

447
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,000
How this came to be...

448
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,360
how it will end.

449
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,000
And I promise you, Daddy,

450
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,880
what I have in store for you
is so much worse

451
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,680
than a cage, or electrodes,
or insanity.

452
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,400
I guess you could say it's...

453
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,640
worse than being me.

454
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,280
But you'll see.

455
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,400
- Who are you?
- The heir to Hamilton Dynamics.

456
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,320
And I got money to spend.

457
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,520
Look, I don't care about any personal
vendetta against Batwoman.

458
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,160
Whether she blew up a shipment
of H or bataranged your dog,

459
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,360
I don't give a feel.

460
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,960
Hamilton Dynamics
wants the technology in that suit

461
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,160
and we're willing to pay for it.

462
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,200
Okay. Well, I don't know how you
heard about our little bake sale,

463
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,960
but I do know what
10 million dollars looks like.

464
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,360
- And it won't fit in that briefcase.
- It's 2.5.

465
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,160
The balance will be wired
to whatever account you...

466
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,360
This is an all-cash business,
Miss Hamilton.

467
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,120
But you want the suit?

468
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,080
It's yours, as soon as we peel it off
of her dead body.

469
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,400
So, I got good news and bad news.

470
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,520
Nope. It's all bad,
and it somehow just got worse.

471
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,440
Shiny, shiny.

472
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,120
2.5 million
for the suit off her dead body.

473
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,840
And with the highest bid
for the privilege of killing her...

474
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,320
sold!

475
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,440
To the gentleman
with a score to settle with the Bat.

476
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,960
The money I lost is nothing
compared to what I'll get for you.

477
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,400
People will pay a premium
for a piece of the Bat.

478
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Luke, now!

479
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,480
Hold still.

480
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
Go check it out.

481
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,080
Please. Please. I won't tell anyone
about you and SRR!

482
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
I know.

483
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,560
Okay, so that was awesome.

484
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,080
- Also, Magpie's here.
- Magpie.

485
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,800
Yeah, I don't know,
but she has the journal

486
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,680
and Luke said she's
heading to the roof.

487
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,840
I'll get her. You get
her out of here.

488
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,640
Seriously?

489
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,880
Early bird gets the worm.

490
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,120
You're a long way from Arkham.

491
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,560
I told you I wasn't a jailbird.

492
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,520
You know what they say
about a bird in the hand?

493
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,080
Yeah. I do.

494
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
No!

495
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,280
Okay, so which one
do you wanna hear first?

496
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:21,200
Thanks for saving my ass
or sorry for always shutting you out?

497
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
You pick.

498
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,920
I'm sorry for always keeping you
at arm's length.

499
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,360
But it's not because
I don't trust you or

500
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,120
think that you can't
handle yourself,

501
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,440
which obviously you can.

502
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,640
It's because I've
already lost one sister.

503
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,480
And the thought of
losing you too, I...

504
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,760
I can't, Mary.

505
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,400
Thank you for not listening to me

506
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,440
and risking your life to save mine.

507
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,360
I guess I just have to get used
to the fact that you are

508
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,320
a total badass.

509
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,080
Badass enough...

510
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,520
to be one of your real
estate assistants?

511
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,040
I believe they prefer
to be called associates.

512
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Okay. All right. I'll see you
in the Batcave.

513
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,440
That is literally the coolest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

514
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,200
- Okay.
- Okay. All right, bye.

515
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,000
<i>We'll always we'll always be home</i>

516
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,880
Crazy night?

517
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,920
- You could definitely say that.
- And apparently, Batwoman was here.

518
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Which is super weird because
the last time I saw Batwoman,

519
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,080
I was with you.

520
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,760
- Kind of a crazy coincidence.
- Actually, it's not.

521
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,360
I wasn't really at the club
sussing out the competition.

522
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,160
Johnny Sabatino stole something
from Wayne Enterprises

523
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,720
and I needed it back,

524
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,960
and Batwoman helped me.

525
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,480
Think you could,
get me her autograph?

526
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Probably not.

527
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,800
But I could give you a ride home.

528
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,000
After tonight I was heading
to get a drink.

529
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,560
Your place still open?

530
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,640
Nope.

531
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,920
<i>I want I wanna show you</i>

532
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,240
<i>Forget forget the old news</i>

533
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,600
<i>You got the world
Right in front of you</i>

534
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,200
<i>They say patience is a virtue</i>

535
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,680
<i>I been looking for the right
I been looking for the right</i>

536
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,720
<i>I been looking for the
right time to show you</i>

537
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,120
<i>Get up get up and resist</i>

538
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,520
<i>Put up put up your two fists</i>

539
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,680
<i>We need we need a new fix</i>

540
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,320
<i>Can't keep going on like this</i>

541
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,720
<i>I been looking for the right
I been looking for the right</i>

542
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,840
<i>I been looking for the right time
To show you</i>

543
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,720
Oh, my god.

544
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,440
Holy crap.

545
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
What?

546
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,000
Oh, god.

547
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,000
No, no, no!

548
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,480
- Okay.
- What?

549
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:42,000
This, absolutely no one can know
about this place, understand?

550
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,680
- Yes.
- Kate's life depends on this,

551
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,040
Mary. I'm serious.

552
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,560
You can trust me, really.

553
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,480
This is the biggest secret

554
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,760
you will ever keep in
your whole life, okay?

555
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,920
Okay, look,

556
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,040
when Bruce first showed
me this place...

557
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:01,600
Bruce Wayne is Batman?

558
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,680
Oh. That's...

559
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,600
Okay.

560
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,000
<i>What do you mean it's gone?</i>

561
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,960
I woke up and Reagan was gone and...

562
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,840
And so was the book.

563
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,440
The book filled with secrets
my dad died to protect.

564
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,040
I never thought that Reagan would...

565
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,280
- I'm sorry, Luke.
- Yeah, sorry doesn't undo the fact

566
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,520
that your life is very much
in danger, again,

567
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,720
as in right where
we started but worse.

568
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,400
Guys, with everyone in Gotham trying

569
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,560
to get their hands on that journal,

570
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,280
I think the million
dollar question is

571
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,080
what would a bloody
bartender want with it.

572
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,520
Hope you know you cost me
a really hot girlfriend, Magpie...

573
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,440
again.

574
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,600
That's what you get
for falling for a mark, again.

575
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,480
You know how this works.

576
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,160
We steal from the rich
because they'll never miss it.

577
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,160
You aren't supposed to miss them.

578
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,240
You got your book.

579
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,680
You can trade it for your
freedom but I'm out.

580
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,960
I'm done being advance
scout for Magpie.

581
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640
I thought you'd do
anything for your sister.

582
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,640
I'm pretty sure I just did.

583
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,320
- Hey.
- Hey.

584
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,840
Since we missed dinner,

585
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,920
how about we grab a
celebratory brekky?

586
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,760
With Tommy Elliot not
getting his day in court,

587
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,280
I'm not sure what there
is to celebrate.

588
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,400
I think we can think of something.

589
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,240
Oh, I gotta get this.
I'll catch you up?

590
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,560
Yeah.

591
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
I was gonna call you.

592
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Yeah.

593
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,040
Yeah.

594
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
I understand.

595
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,120
There's been an unforeseen setback.

596
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,920
I don't have my hands on the
journal yet, but I assure you I will.

597
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,440
And then it'll be yours.

598
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,240
Hold still.

599
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,240
One wrong move and my little
tracker friend will zap you

600
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,680
and you'll be a dead dodo.

601
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
There.

602
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,280
Now, you're free to fly the coop.

603
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,840
Good.

604
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,440
I was never meant
to be a homing pigeon.

605
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,240
How's my new favorite book?

606
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,880
Have you gotten to the chapter yet
that tells us how to kill the Bat?

607
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,040
No, because it appears Tommy Elliot

608
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,480
neglected to share one
very crucial detail.

609
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,120
Lucius Fox wrote the
entire journal in code!
