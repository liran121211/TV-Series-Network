1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,960
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,280
How about we don't get expelled
a week before graduation?

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,720
I need this school, okay?
I wanna be here.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,040
But they don't want you.

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,040
It is best if you just
kept your distance from now on.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,320
I know you love me.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,920
Tell me that I'm wrong
and I'll walk away

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,840
and let you make
the biggest mistake of your life.

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,080
You're wrong, Kate.

10
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,120
- Is this you?
- It wasn't me.

11
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,720
So, what is she doing with herself?

12
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,760
So, are you on this assignment
to keep tabs on me or on Kate?

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,040
- Dad?
- Catherine Hamilton's

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,200
investigators found bones.

15
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,760
Skull fragments of a little girl.
It's Beth.

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,520
Hi, Daddy.

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,920
- Put down the knife.
- You gave up on me!

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,800
Beth, drop the damn knife!

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,760
- Dad.
- Kate, it's her. It's Beth.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,160
I have gift for you too.

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,120
Now that we are together again,

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,520
I can help you become anyone
you want to be.

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,680
Have we met? I'm afraid so.

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,000
Absolutely not.

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,960
Listen, the victim
had the courage

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,000
to come forward
and face her attackers.

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,280
Well, I'm confident a jury
will make the right decision.

28
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,840
Question is, are you?

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,960
Oh, my god.

30
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,080
No, no, no!

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
Oh, god.

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,560
Beth was being held by a madman
with a medical license.

33
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,080
We don't have much to go on.

34
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,080
{\an5}Deed to the house belonged
to Dr. August Cartwright.

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,600
{\an5}I have teams
trying to pick up a trace

36
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,320
{\an5}but it's like he just disappeared.

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,480
{\an5}Apparently, he's a better
magician than he was a doctor.

38
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,440
{\an5}Beth was held in a cell by a guy
making human skin masks

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,760
{\an5}while I was at home
playing club soccer.

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,480
{\an5}We need to find him.

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,960
- We will.
- We didn't find her.

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,680
{\an5}How many times can I say I'm sorry

43
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,120
{\an5}for not listening to you?

44
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,760
{\an5}I don't know.

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,920
{\an5}How many times will it take
to get Beth back?

46
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Sir.

47
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,280
You're gonna want
to see this.

48
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,760
{\an5}<i>Gotham is reeling over the death
of Prosecutor Angus Stanton,</i>

49
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,040
{\an5}<i>who was murdered
horrifically tonight.</i>

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,040
{\an5}<i>Stanton was seen by many
as a hero to Gotham</i>

51
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,560
{\an5}<i>one who brought justice
to the victims</i>

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,120
<i>of some of the city's
most notorious criminals</i>

53
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,000
<i>such as Jack Napier,
otherwise known as the Joker.</i>

54
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,160
Channel Nine has the security
camera footage.

55
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,080
<i>Conviction rate,
Stanton was known...</i>

56
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
- What's he wearing?
- <i>From being a formidable</i>

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,280
<i>opponent in the courtroom,
in addition to being...</i>

58
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,080
It an old-fashioned
executioner's hood.

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,880
<i>- This is Dana Dewitt...</i>
- Ax is a nice touch.

60
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,080
<i>from old Gotham.</i>

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,960
{\an5}Anybody want to tell me
why every news outlet in Gotham

62
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,320
{\an5}had this and we didn't
even get so much

63
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,320
{\an5}as a heads-up from the GCPD?

64
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,360
Technically,
it's outside district lines.

65
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,600
And I believe it's because
they called someone else.

66
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,520
I am not about to stand around
and let Gotham cry out

67
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,520
to be saved by someone
who hides behind a mask.

68
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,480
{\an5}The Bat is nothing more
than a symbol of false hope.

69
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,080
I want this so-called
Executioner cuffed

70
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,880
and stuffed in a cell in Blackgate.

71
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,080
If this city starts to think

72
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,160
it can rely on a vigilante
for justice

73
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,320
{\an5}we might as well hand it over
to the crazies.

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,840
{\an5}Sir, I know it's all hands
on deck for this Stanton Case,

75
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,080
{\an5}but I was hoping
to get your permission

76
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,520
{\an5}for another special assignment.

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,000
- Who is it this time?
- Batwoman.

78
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,200
{\an5}Don't you want to know
who's behind the mask?

79
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
{\an5}Head back, sweetie.

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,000
{\an5}One final touch.

81
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
There.

82
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,720
Dazzle me.

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,080
A perfect match for Dean Deveraux.

84
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,320
{\an5}Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Deveraux?

85
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,120
{\an5}Please, don't hurt me.

86
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,280
{\an5}I don't understand
why we don't just kill him.

87
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,320
Because my sister is watching me
like a hawk.

88
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
Still trying to bring
the old Beth back.

89
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:05,000
You're not thinking of giving her
the old Beth back, are you?

90
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,400
- Of course not.
- Really?

91
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,160
Because the old Alice I remember

92
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,040
wouldn't think second thought
about opening his throat

93
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,480
with a butterfly knife.

94
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,200
- She's changed you.
- Not at all.

95
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,840
You're the one who's changed.
You used to trust me.

96
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,320
What about you, Dean?
Do you trust me?

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,800
I think you'd make
an excellent partner.

98
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,160
I seem to be in need
of a replacement.

99
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,280
Stop.

100
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,920
Stop.

101
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,680
I'll do whatever you want.

102
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,400
Good.

103
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,520
Because I need you to steal
Catherine's shiny new toy.

104
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,280
The one that she's too stingy
to share.

105
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,320
- You see the Bat-Signal?
- That is why I'm here.

106
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,760
You know, what this means, right?

107
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,360
First time the city's called
Batwoman for back-up means

108
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,240
- I can't screw it up.
- It means you're in.

109
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,080
GCPD's got you
on their speed dial now.

110
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,600
- Commissioner Forbes trusts you.
- Commissioner might.

111
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,760
My dad still sees me as his enemy.

112
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,720
Stopping this guy has
to convince him otherwise.

113
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,360
That's not the only reason
worth stopping him.

114
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,160
Stanton was the prosecutor

115
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,800
who put away the guy
that killed my dad.

116
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,280
It's armed robbery, right?

117
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,360
Night of my high school graduation.

118
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,840
We were celebrating,

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,360
me getting into MIT.

120
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,040
We ran out of ice.
My dad went out to go get some.

121
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,520
Next thing I know,
there are two cops at the door,

122
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,560
wanting me to come down
and ID the body.

123
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,400
We were waiting on him
to cut the cake.

124
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,280
Lucius Fox did a lot of good
for this city.

125
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,400
Yeah, so did Stanton.

126
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,960
He never stopped until he put the guy

127
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,120
who shot my dad behind bars.

128
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,920
- Any suspects?
- Well, if you exclude

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,480
the law-abiding citizens of Gotham,

130
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,920
that leaves the other half.

131
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,560
There has to be some way
to narrow that down.

132
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,080
Start with the violent offenders.

133
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,000
Cross-reference with recent parolees,

134
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,400
work release, and escapees

135
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,240
with whatever biometrics we can get

136
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,160
- from the security footage.
- All right.

137
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
This is interesting.

138
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,960
Chris Medlock, otherwise known
as Chris the Fist.

139
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,880
- Ex-boxer. Ex-con.
- What was The Fist in for?

140
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,240
Shot and killed a bartender.

141
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,400
He confessed,
later claimed it was coerced...

142
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
But they found the gun in his car.

143
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
Pleaded down to second-degree murder.

144
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
Got 30 in Blackgate.

145
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
He was lucky to avoid
the death penalty.

146
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
Yeah, The Fist did not see it
that way.

147
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,560
{\an5}Check out his sentencing...

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,720
{\an5}<i>I'll get you, you son of a bitch!
This ain't over!</i>

149
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,640
{\an5}<i>I got a whole bunch of time
to figure out</i>

150
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,040
{\an5}<i>how I'm gonna kill your ass!</i>

151
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,440
{\an5}Thanks to overcrowding,

152
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,440
he was paroled
just a few months ago.

153
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,440
Can't wait to meet him.
Guy have an address?

154
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,840
We may not need one.

155
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,320
Check out what just came
in over GCPD dispatch.

156
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,280
<i>Someone claiming to be
the Executioner</i>

157
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,920
<i>barricaded himself
inside a building</i>

158
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,080
<i>at the 200 block of Rucka Avenue.</i>

159
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,880
<i>Claims to have several hostages.</i>

160
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,400
That's in West Harlow.

161
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,040
- Put it on the screen.
- Okay.

162
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,520
All right, let's get on this.

163
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,760
I don't care
if it's outside our District.

164
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,120
Let's show Gotham
we can keep them safe.

165
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Move!

166
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,840
He talking?

167
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,600
Says he'll only speak to one guy.

168
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,320
- A Detective Donnelly.
- Who?

169
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,480
<i>Detective Donnelly,
time is running out on your hostages.</i>

170
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
<i>Get in here or I start</i>

171
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,760
<i>- shooting these people!</i>
- Listen,

172
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,000
you don't have to go in there.

173
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,640
Let me get a negotiator
down here.

174
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
No, me and The Fist go way back.

175
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,640
<i>Detective!</i>

176
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,840
Like the new look.

177
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,360
- Red suits you.
- Goes with everything.

178
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,320
<i>Time's up, Donnelly!</i>

179
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,960
No, Donnelly! Stay back!

180
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,920
No, wait! Stop!

181
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,400
I'm hit.

182
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,720
You're bleeding. I'll get you help.

183
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,680
Thanks, Kate.

184
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh, my god! Sophie.

185
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,080
I need to know if you can fix her.

186
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,200
What was she shot with?

187
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,960
- A bullet.
- I know it's a bullet!

188
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,760
Hollow-point,
blackout or wadcutter?

189
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,000
- Does it matter?
- Why did you bring her here?

190
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,520
She can afford a real hospital.

191
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
You were closer and I am not.

192
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,120
And I need you to keep her here
until I get back.

193
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,240
The Crows don't know
she's missing.

194
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,040
- No, you can't...
- Do not let her leave.

195
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,160
Man of the hour.

196
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,360
Congratulations.

197
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,720
You have succeeded
where so many have failed.

198
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,800
The coil accelerator,
it works at last.

199
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,560
And I just have to know,

200
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,360
how were you able to overcome

201
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,840
the ferromagnetic projectile
saturation?

202
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,480
You almost had me there,
Miss Hamilton.

203
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Trick question,
that's proprietary information.

204
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,280
Hard to imagine...

205
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,640
Something so delicate
harnessing enough power

206
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,200
to penetrate the bat suit.

207
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,480
Well done, Dean.

208
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,760
- She called you Kate?
- She knows who I am.

209
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,000
Amazing. That's... look great.
Fantastic.

210
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,040
So naturally,
you decided to dropped her off

211
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,680
at your sister's unlicensed clinic.

212
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,840
Mary will take care of her.

213
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,160
She'll also keep her from leaving.

214
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,720
And as long as she can't leave,
she can't talk.

215
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,560
But she's a Crow.
Your father's second in command.

216
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,680
You really think you can
convince her not to tell him?

217
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,960
I'll deal with that after we've
dealt with the Executioner.

218
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,280
We need to figure out
his next target.

219
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,200
The guy not making it easy.
He keeps changing his MO.

220
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,440
50,000 volts of electricity,
then a bunch of rifles.

221
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,720
- Doesn't make any sense.
- Unless it's a pattern.

222
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,440
The Fist dresses up
as an executioner.

223
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,600
Kills Stanton with electricity,
like an electric chair.

224
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,480
Then, he gets Donnelly to walk in
on that shooting gallery.

225
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,040
Like a firing squad.

226
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,520
He's using methods
of capital punishment

227
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
- to kill his victims.
- On it.

228
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,080
Gotham's used three ways
to kill people on death row,

229
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,360
electric chair, firing squad,

230
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,720
which made a brief comeback
under Mayor Cobblepot,

231
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,000
and the gas chamber.

232
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,680
So his next victim will be with gas.

233
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,960
Guy's got a flair for detail,
so I'll bet you a batarang,

234
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,440
he'll use hydrogen cyanide pellets

235
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,000
just like they did
in the gas chamber.

236
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,240
And...

237
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,800
And there's only one warehouse
in Gotham that stores them.

238
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,920
- Who's there?
- Someone who needs information.

239
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,000
Holy crap. You're her.

240
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,480
I got to get this.

241
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
- Damn, girl.
- Not happening.

242
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,720
Anything out of the ordinary
around here lately?

243
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,760
- Well, besides this?
- Answer the question.

244
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,120
That'd mean someone
had to get by me

245
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,480
and that ain't gonna happen.

246
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,160
It's been quiet.

247
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,800
But, you know, it doesn't have to be.

248
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,720
Let me buy you a drink

249
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,080
and you can tell me
all about the superhero thing.

250
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,160
I've been thinking about
getting into the game myself.

251
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,760
What do you say?

252
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,520
I get off at 11.00,
and if you play your cards right,

253
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,400
you won't be too far behind.

254
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,200
Okay, so this place
hasn't seen any action.

255
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,200
And apparently,
neither has its guard.

256
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,360
Yeah. I think I might know why.

257
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,720
<i>Got a visual on Chris The Fist,
alleyway at Sprang River.</i>

258
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,920
Get off of me, man.
I didn't do nothing.

259
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,040
Oh, got it.

260
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,640
So you're just out
for a late night jog.

261
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,920
Crows got The Fist.

262
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,120
Well, I guess a lot of people
will be sleeping easier tonight.

263
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,520
I know you wanted to catch him,

264
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,360
but you can convince the Crows
you're not their enemy tomorrow.

265
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,400
Tomorrow may be too late.
I need to check on Sophie.

266
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,280
Kate, you copy?

267
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,200
<i>Kate? Kate?</i>

268
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,800
Kate, do you copy?
What just happened?

269
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,360
The Crows got the wrong guy.

270
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,400
And the Executioner
got what he came for.

271
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,880
All of this Bat-Tech and you
came up with frozen water?

272
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,240
I checked every camera angle
on the warehouse security system,

273
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,080
but license plate's got mud
or something on it.

274
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,560
We can't get a good view of it.

275
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,320
Don't suppose you were able
to make it out?

276
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,240
Didn't quite catch it
when it plowed into me.

277
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,960
Oh, that's... oh, that's great!

278
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,320
- My ribs would argue otherwise.
- No. I'm serious, okay?

279
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,240
The suit's carbon-fiber ribbing
is designed to absorb any impact.

280
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,760
So any deformation in the fibers
is recorded in the suites data.

281
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,640
Okay. So it was
originally designed

282
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,120
to track damage caused by bullets.

283
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,000
You know, blunt force trauma,
that kind of thing.

284
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,480
There's no reason it wouldn't pick up

285
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,080
an impression from a car bumper.

286
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,680
Or a license plate.

287
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,600
Okay. It's a partial,
but it will work.

288
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,400
Okay, the truck is registered
to a Bertrand Eldon.

289
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,120
And he was at Blackgate
for 20 years.

290
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,560
What was he in for?

291
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,360
He worked there.
He was their executioner.

292
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,520
No!

293
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,160
I just did some of the best work
of my life

294
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,440
crocheting you back together.

295
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
What?

296
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,120
Where am I?
Mary, what the hell is going on?

297
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,600
Batwoman brought you in.
You were shot.

298
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,680
- Batwoman?
- Okay.

299
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:02,320
I feel like we glossed over
the part where I saved your life.

300
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Thank you.

301
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,200
You work here?

302
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
It's mine.

303
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,960
My followers think
I'm turning up at the club

304
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,440
ordering bottle service.

305
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,880
The truth is, I'm usually here,

306
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,520
trying to help serve the people
the Gotham hospitals turn away.

307
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,000
Mary, if your dad ever found out

308
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,120
- about this place...
- He won't.

309
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
He can't.

310
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,320
Yeah, I didn't do that.

311
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,280
Well, you better undo it.

312
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,160
Batwoman will kill me.

313
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,840
And frankly, she's scarier than you.

314
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,120
Mary, why am I cuffed to this bed?

315
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,640
She, she said not to let you leave.

316
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,880
Do you know who she is?

317
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,120
No. Honestly, I don't want to know.

318
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,680
I don't need
that kind of responsibility.

319
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,200
Well, I do know who she is.

320
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,320
And that's why
she won't let me leave.

321
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,480
I'm in.

322
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
No, one's home.

323
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,560
Why would a guy working
at Blackgate

324
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,240
target a cop and a prosecutor?
They're on the same side.

325
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,720
<i>That doesn't make any sense.</i>

326
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,680
I'm looking for that answer
right now.

327
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,320
Looks like he was a model employee.

328
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
Stay frosty.

329
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,240
<i>This guy is methodical,
technically proficient.</i>

330
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,680
<i>Always a few steps ahead.</i>

331
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,160
<i>He could have anything
waiting for you in there.</i>

332
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,280
Already has,
just sitting on the coffee table.

333
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
What?

334
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,320
The hydrogen cyanide pellets.
I found them.

335
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,120
- On the coffee table?
- Yes.

336
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,320
- Well, it's probably a trap.
- I'm aware of that.

337
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,520
I don't see any trip-sensors
or wires or pressure plates.

338
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,960
What's the Bat-Protocol
with this?

339
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,960
Like, I just stand here
staring at this thing

340
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,720
waiting for the Executioner
to come back, come on.

341
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,880
Yeah, okay. Hang on. Just...

342
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,240
Can you place some hold music
while I wait?

343
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,720
No, okay. I'm just gonna grab it.

344
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
No, no, no! Don't do that.

345
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,400
<i>- Kate, don't.</i>
- Too late.

346
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,960
- And?
- And I'm still talking to you.

347
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
- It's light.
- Is it empty?

348
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,840
Not quite.

349
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,280
<i>So if you found this,
then you found me and...</i>

350
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,600
<i>And I did it. I am guilty as sin.
But I'm not the only one.</i>

351
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,800
<i>For 20 years,</i>

352
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,880
<i>I threw the switch on the worst
people Gotham ever spat out.</i>

353
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,440
<i>I was glad to do it too.
Doing the public a service.</i>

354
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,040
<i>And it never bothered me when
they said they were innocent.</i>

355
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,760
Great. Sadistic and long-winded.

356
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,400
<i>I mean, what else
were they gonna say, right?</i>

357
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,840
<i>See, then all their stories,
they started to sound the same.</i>

358
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,920
<i>The same names kept coming up.
Same evidence.</i>

359
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,720
<i>And everybody who sat in my chair
started to look the same.</i>

360
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,200
<i>Black, brown, poor.</i>

361
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,440
<i>In 20 years,
I never juiced a rich, white guy.</i>

362
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,360
<i>So I started digging
into their files.</i>

363
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,480
<i>You know, what I found?</i>

364
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,760
<i>The same three corrupt
law enforcement officials</i>

365
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,000
<i>pulling the strings in every case.</i>

366
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,160
<i>Coerced confessions.</i>

367
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,520
<i>And murder weapons suddenly
showing up out of nowhere.</i>

368
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,160
<i>I mean, obviously planted.</i>

369
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,560
Didn't Chris the Fist say that
his confession was coerced?

370
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,720
<i>So it turns out...</i>

371
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,880
And the murder weapon just
suddenly turned up in his car?

372
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,880
<i>The people that I executed
were innocent.</i>

373
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,400
<i>Which meant that...</i>

374
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,360
<i>That I was the guilty one.</i>

375
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,480
<i>That, that cabal, it, it turned me
into a murderer.</i>

376
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,040
<i>Which they, they made me punish
the innocent.</i>

377
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,200
So, who's the third member
of this cabal?

378
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Wait.

379
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,280
You're not actually buying this.

380
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,080
Okay, believe me, I... I know racial
profiling is a thing in Gotham,

381
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,880
but this guy is obviously crazy.

382
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,040
Almost killed Sophie.
Nearly made you roadkill.

383
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,360
- Doesn't make him wrong.
- He's an admitted killer, Kate!

384
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,640
I knew Stanton, okay?

385
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,640
He spent hours with my family,
day after day.

386
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,640
And he never, ever stopped working

387
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,000
until he found justice.

388
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,120
If Stanton's accused of being dirty,

389
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,400
my dad's killer could use that
to get a new trial.

390
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,120
But if Chris the Fist
or anyone else goes down

391
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,360
for something they didn't do,
how is that justice?

392
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,600
Little present from the Crows.
Next time, call us first.

393
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,000
We may not have a klieg light,
but we do have a phone number.

394
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,520
Everybody, fan out!

395
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,560
Move, move.

396
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,520
Your turn.

397
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,720
It, it's okay. You can just win.

398
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,840
I said, your turn.

399
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,040
King me?

400
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,440
- What?
<i>- It's me.</i>

401
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,640
How did you get this number?

402
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,760
<i>Let's call it "twintuition".</i>

403
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,160
<i>Why did you send Mouse
into Hamilton Dynamics</i>

404
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,880
<i>to get a weapon
that can kill Batwoman?</i>

405
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,920
- Where is he?
<i>- He's fine. Or he will be.</i>

406
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
<i>As long as you tell me the truth.</i>

407
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,440
Dear sister, if I wanted to kill you,

408
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,960
I wouldn't have to wait for you
to be wearing the suit.

409
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,560
<i>That's so sweet of you.</i>

410
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,480
<i>Your concern for me
is so touching, dear sister.</i>

411
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,320
So Kate is Batwoman.

412
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,200
- I do not like being toyed with!
- And I don't like traitors.

413
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,040
What's wrong with you?

414
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,800
First, she abandons you.
Then, she tries to lock you away.

415
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
And still, you try to protect her.

416
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,880
Because she's still my sister!

417
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,600
Real family doesn't abandon
their own.

418
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,800
Who snuck food to you
in the middle of the night?

419
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,880
Who taught you Rummy,
and let you sleep with Mr. Pandy,

420
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,600
and promised to protect you
no matter what?

421
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,600
Me! I did, Alice!

422
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,560
Because I was there and she wasn't!

423
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,240
After everything we've been through,

424
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,040
you keep secrets from me?

425
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,960
Try keeping that a secret.

426
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:19,480
<i>Okay, so who had
"Batwoman rescues a psychopath"</i>

427
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,800
<i>on their bingo card?</i>

428
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,600
<i>Because I've got some big,
fat empty spaces</i>

429
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,960
<i>for "Batwoman takes down Alice"</i>

430
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:27,480
<i>and "Batwoman gets a cat
out of a tree."</i>

431
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,920
<i>Talk to me, Gotham. Anyone
else feeling a little bat-trayed?</i>

432
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,840
<i>The people that I executed
were innocent.</i>

433
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,160
<i>Which meant that...</i>

434
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,360
<i>That I was the guilty one.</i>

435
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,400
<i>But that cabal
led by Judge Calverick</i>

436
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,440
<i>condemned innocent people to die.</i>

437
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,000
I heard you got a visit
from Batwoman.

438
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,640
More like an ambush.

439
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,400
Now, one nutjob wants me
to listen to another nutjob.

440
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,080
Claims Judge Calverick,

441
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,280
one of Gotham's most
upstanding justices, is a fraud.

442
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,320
So, you're not even gonna look
into this Judge?

443
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,960
Why? Because some
social justice warrior

444
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,640
thinks he knows more
about the rule of law

445
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,520
than the cops and the lawyers
who protect this city? Nah.

446
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,720
We got the right guy.
Batwoman interfered.

447
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,960
Batwoman wouldn't have stepped in
if she didn't have a reason.

448
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,720
Before you give a shred
of credibility

449
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,440
to some criminal in a bat costume,

450
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,960
let me remind you that Batman
destroyed our family's lives.

451
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,960
He is not the one that drove
Mom's car off that bridge.

452
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,440
Well, he may as well have been.

453
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,600
Batman brought out
all the crazies in Gotham.

454
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,360
If it weren't for him,
there wouldn't have been a Joker.

455
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,240
Your Mom would be alive.
And Beth wouldn't be Alice.

456
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,800
Beth is Alice because
we stopped looking for her.

457
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,920
Not arguing about this right now.

458
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,200
That'd be a lot easier, wouldn't it?

459
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,480
Just... act like
we did nothing wrong?

460
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,120
We looked everywhere for Beth.

461
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,440
I looked everywhere.

462
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,400
I hold onto hope for the both of us.

463
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,200
Despite the lack of evidence,
despite the police giving up.

464
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,400
Despite the fact that everyone
thought she was dead.

465
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,840
I hoped when it was hard.

466
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,720
And you just gave up

467
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,520
and put your energy
into blaming Batman

468
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,760
because it was easy.

469
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,440
That's why Beth is Alice.

470
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,600
You wouldn't listen then,
and you won't listen now.

471
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,800
And an innocent man
is gonna pay the price for it.

472
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Look who lucked out

473
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,320
by getting the last grape
popsicle.

474
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,240
Looks like you're healing nicely.

475
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,320
But I guess,
healing can't get in the way

476
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,480
of you spilling the tea on Batwoman?

477
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,760
Believe it or not,
I'm trying to protect her.

478
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,400
By having my dad shut down
her entire operation?

479
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,960
She's gonna get herself killed.

480
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,280
Batwoman can take care of herself.

481
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,000
Just like she took care of you.
Twice by my count.

482
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,080
And now,
you're just gonna betray her?

483
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
I...

484
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,240
I mean, what?
Is that like, your thing?

485
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,400
What's that supposed to mean?

486
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,000
I mean,
that's what you did to Kate.

487
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,600
And then,
she had to put an entire ocean

488
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,240
between you and her.
And now you walk around,

489
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,160
pretend like
she meant nothing to you.

490
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,240
You don't even know what happened.

491
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,880
No. But I saw what it did to her.

492
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,040
Look, you're right.
That's not my drama.

493
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,040
So do what you want.

494
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,400
In the meantime,

495
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,400
ibuprofen every four to six hours.

496
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,240
And change the bandage once a day.

497
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,960
Don't tell my dad about this clinic.

498
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,000
And maybe think about
whether or not

499
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,480
you want to add Batwoman
to the list of people you hurt.

500
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,440
Working late, Your Honor?

501
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,600
- How... how did you...
- Looks like you're burning

502
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,000
more than the midnight oil.

503
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,600
Is that the evidence?

504
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,960
Donnelly got the confessions,
Stanton convinced the jury,

505
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,600
and you just banged your gavel.

506
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,840
I can pay you.
You have to protect me from him.

507
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,160
You'll get around the clock
protection at Blackgate.

508
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,360
Free of charge.

509
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,680
Go!

510
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,520
You protect him?

511
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,880
A man who sent so many innocents
to their deaths?

512
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,120
The law will take care of it.

513
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,600
Yeah, I used to believe that too.

514
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,600
Until the law turned me
into a murderer.

515
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,160
The law's not perfect.
I'll give you that.

516
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,040
Doesn't mean
you get to rewrite it in blood.

517
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,000
If you trust law so much,
why are you wearing that suit?

518
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,720
I'm gonna need backup.

519
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,240
What do you want me to say?
He makes a good point.

520
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,680
<i>No. For the Judge.</i>

521
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,680
Get the Judge
into protective custody now.

522
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,400
Right. On it.

523
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,040
Sweep the rest of the building.

524
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,240
You decided to go
after the right guy.

525
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,320
I don't see how you and him
are that different.

526
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,840
Taking the law into your own hands.

527
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,120
Appointing yourself judge and jury.

528
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,800
Pretty sure you just did
the exact same thing.

529
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,720
I saved your life.

530
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,480
You telling me I made a mistake?

531
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,960
I don't know. Ask The Fist.

532
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,160
I admit I got it wrong.

533
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,920
But you know the difference
between me and you?

534
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,920
When I make a mistake,
everybody knows my name.

535
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,520
I am accountable
to the people of Gotham.

536
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,640
You...

537
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
You hide behind your anonymity.

538
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,560
Who are you accountable to?

539
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,880
Guess we'll find out.

540
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,360
Heart rate monitor linked
to a dead man's switch.

541
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,760
Looks like we're about to join him.

542
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,240
This is Kane. Anybody read me?

543
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,760
Suit's showing
oxygen levels dropping.

544
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,360
No, kidding. Executioner turned
this room to a gas chamber.

545
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,360
Can your men get us out of here?

546
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,840
He triggered the lockdown procedure.

547
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,960
Every way in and out of here
are sealed off.

548
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,040
Steel-reinforced doors.

549
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,880
By the time my guys
get through them...

550
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,640
Air's getting thin in here.
I need a solution.

551
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:34,800
You went to MIT.

552
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,520
I got in. I didn't actually go.

553
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,360
Okay.

554
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,640
Okay, hydrogen cyanide.
Emphasis on hydrogen.

555
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,440
It's, it's flammable.
Think the Hindenburg.

556
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,720
Not a comforting thought.

557
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,840
The point is, you can ignite it.

558
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,160
The flames will burn off
the cyanide.

559
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,800
- Okay, copy.
- Only problem is,

560
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,840
hydrogen will only burn
at six percent saturation.

561
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,840
For those of us
who didn't get into MIT.

562
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,480
You got to let the gas
fill the room first.

563
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,920
We're not gonna last that long.

564
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,160
We got to try, Kate.
You're only at three percent.

565
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,040
Okay, you got to hang in there.

566
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,160
We need to stay low
to the ground.

567
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,640
- Get away from me.
- Come on.

568
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,600
That symbol
took everything from me.

569
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,280
It's not gonna be
the last thing I see.

570
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,160
Stay with me. Stay awake.

571
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,640
Come on, Commander. Talk to me.

572
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,360
Tell me all the reasons
you hate Batman.

573
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,800
That symbol let my family die.

574
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Four percent.

575
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,000
Hey, if you're gonna
hate the symbol,

576
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,160
hate the symbol. Okay?

577
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,760
Let it fuel you
into staying alive.

578
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,760
Five percent.

579
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,320
I have to blame that symbol.

580
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,920
If I don't...

581
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,360
If you don't, what? Tell me.

582
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,040
I have to blame myself.

583
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,520
Six percent. Do it.

584
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,640
<i>Kate, come on. Talk to me.</i>

585
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,560
Commander. Commander.

586
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,840
We're okay.

587
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,080
<i>Never let it be said</i>

588
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,640
<i>that Gotham's Gadfly
does not give credit</i>

589
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,880
<i>where credit is due.</i>

590
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,360
<i>Batwoman got this one right
and the rest of us whiffed.</i>

591
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,240
<i>Guess Jacob Kane
won't be the only one</i>

592
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,640
<i>eating a little crow.</i>

593
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,840
<i>Boxer Chris "The Fist" Medlock</i>

594
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,680
<i>was not only cleared
in the Executioner murders,</i>

595
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,960
<i>but also exonerated
of his past murder conviction.</i>

596
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,920
<i>Talk about a one-two punch.</i>

597
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,280
<i>Not so good news for the man
who convicted him,</i>

598
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,880
<i>Judge Raymond Calverick.</i>

599
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,360
<i>The DA has vowed to reopen
all cases tainted</i>

600
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,280
<i>by this extra-legal cabal,</i>

601
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,080
<i>including deceased
Detective Stu Donnelly</i>

602
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,200
<i>and Prosecutor Angus Stanton.</i>

603
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,280
You're right behind me,
aren't you?

604
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,160
Where is she?

605
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,040
I... You... you know, she just left.

606
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,800
- How can I put this?
- You let her escape.

607
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,280
I know you said to hold on to her.

608
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,000
But my stepdad is her boss,

609
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,960
and I'm running a little short
on family right now.

610
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,080
Not that you asked
about my personal life,

611
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,760
but it's a mess.

612
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,320
The last thing I need
is him shutting down

613
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,040
the one good thing I have
going on...

614
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,960
Thank you for saving her life.

615
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,360
Yeah. It's not a big thing.

616
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,480
Hey, FYI, she knows who you are.

617
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,800
Hey, chill, she didn't tell me.

618
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,120
But I got the distinct impression
that she's gonna tell my stepdad,

619
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,960
so good luck with that.

620
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,080
<i>Well, Bruce, now I know
how much it must have sucked</i>

621
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,200
<i>hearing your Uncle blame you
for what happened on the bridge.</i>

622
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,720
<i>But he had to blame someone.</i>

623
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,760
<i>Seeing him fight so hard
to avoid the truth</i>

624
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,280
<i>that was right in front of him,</i>

625
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,920
<i>made me realize
I was doing the same thing.</i>

626
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,400
<i>I've been blaming my dad
for not saving Beth that day.</i>

627
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
<i>But it wasn't his hand on that door.</i>

628
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,800
<i>Only inches away from her.</i>

629
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,000
<i>He wasn't the one who crossed
that house off the list of places</i>

630
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,440
<i>where Beth could be.</i>

631
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,240
I don't know how,

632
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,280
but we are gonna get Beth back.

633
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,080
And this time, I swear to you,

634
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,440
I won't ever give up.

635
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,960
<i>I don't know if forgiving my father</i>

636
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,560
<i>will help me forgive myself,</i>

637
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,400
<i>but I have to try.</i>

638
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,440
I thought I might find you here.

639
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,840
How could you ever think

640
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,920
I was trying to replace you,
little Mouse?

641
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,160
Why are you so determined
to protect her?

642
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,240
Because I'm saving her a seat
at our tea party!

643
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,760
It was supposed to be
a table for two.

644
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,240
Yes.

645
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,560
The two of us.

646
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,240
Two halves of one whole.

647
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,120
Just as Kate and I are two halves.

648
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,600
And I need your help
to make us whole.

649
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,840
I can't do this without you.

650
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I don't want to share you with her.

651
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,680
Mouse.

652
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,480
You won't have to share me.

653
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,880
Because we'll be sharing her.

654
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,000
And what if she doesn't want
to play?

655
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,920
Well...

656
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,800
Then it's good we have that then.

657
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,320
Trade you Mr. Pandy for it.

658
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,880
You kept it?

659
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,400
To remind me of you.
