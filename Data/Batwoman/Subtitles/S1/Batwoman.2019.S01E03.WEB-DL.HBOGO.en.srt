1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,920
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Seriously, Kate, you can't be
going out in Gotham every night

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,480
pretending to be Batman.

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,040
Catherine Hamilton's
investigators found bones,

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,320
skull fragments of a little girl.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,680
It's Beth.

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,920
Who the hell are you?

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,320
I'm Alice. How do you do?

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,520
I think Alice is Beth.

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,120
I know that you want to believe
that Beth is alive.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,600
I do too, but facts are facts.

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,480
My father gave up on me,

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,520
and I want to make him suffer
the way that I did.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,080
<i>"Will you walk a little faster?"
Said a whiting to a snail.</i>

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,800
<i>"There's a porpoise close behind us</i>

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,920
<i>and he's treading on my tail.</i>

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,920
<i>See how eagerly the lobsters
and the turtles all advance.</i>

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
<i>They are waiting on the shingle,</i>

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,040
<i>will you come and join the dance?"</i>

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,480
<i>Will you, won't you,
will you, won't you,</i>

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,200
<i>will you come and join the dance?</i>

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
{\an5}<i>Alice figured me out, Bruce.</i>

23
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,400
{\an5}<i>I put on your suit to terrify her,</i>

24
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,920
{\an5}<i>but it can't protect me
if she knows who I am.</i>

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,920
{\an5}<i>I lost my advantage.</i>

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,080
{\an5}<i>And in the process,
I gave Gotham their hero back.</i>

27
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,240
<i>I didn't sign up for this part.</i>

28
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,240
<i>I never meant to give the city
so much hope.</i>

29
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,760
{\an5}<i>I can't do this. I'm not you.</i>

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,560
Subtle.

31
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
I guess it's broken.

32
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,360
- It's supposed to call Batman.
- What do you want?

33
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,680
{\an5}What happened
to your batsuit knockoff, Kate?

34
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,200
{\an5}Too tight? No give?

35
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,720
{\an5}Or did you just realize that you
accidentally blew a dog whistle

36
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,680
that you can't unblow.

37
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,720
{\an5}I wore it to protect myself
from you and your goons.

38
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,240
{\an5}And in the process
you made everyone horny

39
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,920
for Batman.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
{\an5}All these poor souls gazing up
at the bat light, thinking...

41
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,720
{\an5}"My life is about to change."

42
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,960
{\an5}Nope. Still sucks.

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,600
Are you suggesting
that I put it back on?

44
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,720
No.

45
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,440
{\an5}Being a hero is not your strong suit.

46
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,240
{\an5}I would know, seeing as
you let Dad declare me dead.

47
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,880
{\an5}Where is my boyfriend?

48
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,280
Hanging in there.

49
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,000
You like damaged men.

50
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,400
He's badly damaged.

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,320
You may want to get him back soon.

52
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,200
Okay, I'll play.

53
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,800
How?

54
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,880
{\an5}Show me you can stop killing people.

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,440
{\an5}Last 24 hours and I'll reassess.

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,440
Rats.

57
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,800
I lost my pocket watch.

58
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,040
{\an5}And I lost my sister.
Beth. Remember her?

59
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,560
Yeah. I would like her back.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,760
{\an5}You are going to be
very annoying, aren't you?

61
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,880
Very.

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,840
{\an5}Fine. No killing.

63
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,920
{\an5}But only for my darling
Dodgson's sake,

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,240
{\an5}not for Beth.

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,400
{\an5}Beth has gone down,
down, down the rabbit hole

66
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,400
and she's never coming back.

67
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,160
Much like Gotham's beloved Bat.

68
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,480
You've worked hard
to get where you are.

69
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
You deserve to feel safe.

70
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,280
Don't you want your kids
to be able to play outside again?

71
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,680
<i>Elliot Estates are Gotham's
walls within the walls,</i>

72
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,280
<i>with on-site 24-hour Crows security,</i>

73
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,920
<i>and a safe room in every unit.</i>

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,560
<i>Have you been mugged?</i>

75
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,400
<i>Has your property been vandalized?</i>

76
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,720
<i>At Elliot Estates,</i>

77
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,920
<i>you don't ever have to worry
about that again.</i>

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,160
<i>How do I know?</i>

79
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,320
<i>I'm Tommy Elliot and I'm here
to make Gotham safe again.</i>

80
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,680
Nice. Okay, yes.

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,920
Now I'm that annoyingly
over-protective husband.

82
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,880
- You're married.
- Yes, yes. Nice.

83
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,600
- Nice.
- Are you happy?

84
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Yeah.

85
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,640
You're a little more aggressive
than usual.

86
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,400
What's the problem,
you can't take it?

87
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,520
All right.

88
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,120
You need to move on.

89
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,920
You know most couples
just have breakfast together.

90
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,520
I've got an energy bar in my bag.

91
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,760
Oh, can we split it?

92
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,000
Well, front desk says
the commander's here.

93
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,160
I gotta go.

94
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,880
You can watch it a million times.

95
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,160
Alice still gets away at the end.

96
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,640
No one's taken responsibility
for the attack.

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,120
Trail's gone cold.

98
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,160
Who'd want her dead
when she's already in custody?

99
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,680
Besides most of Gotham?

100
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,200
What can I do for you, Agent Moore?

101
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,400
I think I can be helpful, sir.

102
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,480
Considering Alice could attack
again at any time,

103
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,880
I was hoping to get your approval
for a special assignment.

104
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,800
<i>Okay, people, Vesper Fairchild here.</i>

105
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,680
<i>So I'm staring at my wall chart,</i>

106
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:05,080
<i>has it really been ten days
without a Batman sighting?</i>

107
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,400
<i>Anyone else feeling ghosted?</i>

108
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,160
<i>Talk to me, Gotham, where's Batman?</i>

109
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,800
Okay, I'll just get this.
It'll pinch a little bit.

110
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,520
Three, two and you're done.

111
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,160
Wow, you are so brave. High-five.

112
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,960
- Late night?
- Sophie, hey.

113
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,120
If you're looking for Kate,
she's not here.

114
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,000
In fact, she rarely comes home.

115
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,840
You know, I wouldn't be surprised
if she was dating again

116
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,040
seeing as she's single, and gorgeous,

117
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,440
and emotionally available.

118
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,040
Do you normally stay out all night

119
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,000
when a psychopath
is targeting your family?

120
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,800
What was I supposed to do,
not go to Kylie Q's Glam Jam

121
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,160
and miss next summer's colors?

122
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,200
You're in danger, Mary.

123
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,800
Okay, well, I also have a life, so.

124
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,760
So your father just made me
your bodyguard.

125
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,120
I'm sorry, what?

126
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,280
That is not your desk.

127
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,680
Do you hear that?

128
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,040
That is the sound of me

129
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,120
officially having more money
than Bruce Wayne.

130
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,280
Tommy Elliot.

131
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,080
How the hell did you even
get in here?

132
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,480
What's up, Candy Kane?

133
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,640
Well, Bruce never showed you
the hide-a-key?

134
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,240
But I thought you were buffing up
on some lesbian ninja retreat.

135
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,560
Why are you here, Tommy?

136
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,200
Come here. Check it out.

137
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,760
You see this building?

138
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,840
I just bought it.

139
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
Five stories taller than Wayne Tower.

140
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
Bruce and Tommy.

141
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,840
Childhood friends
who still act like children.

142
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,960
"What is a friend?

143
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,120
A single soul dwelling
in two bodies."

144
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,000
Is that some secret society thing?

145
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,320
It's an Aristotle thing.

146
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,360
Gotham has gotten all intense
now that Batman's back.

147
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,400
And if you heard,

148
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,120
Gotham's Dark Knight
has the city swooning again.

149
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,680
I saw the picture.

150
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,040
Yeah, it was...

151
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,200
Pixilated.

152
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,840
Wow, I...

153
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,800
I mean, that's your reaction?

154
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,000
The guy had...

155
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,600
Your mom and your sister
in his win column.

156
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,720
He blinked...

157
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,280
And they died.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,120
Oh, Kate,
I thought you'd be more upset.

159
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,200
I've had time to process.

160
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,360
Batman saved your mom's life
a few years later.

161
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,240
Guess he's not a total deadbeat,
you know?

162
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,320
So where's Brucey Boy?

163
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,760
I wanted to invite him

164
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,520
to celebrate my new pile of bricks.

165
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,880
Bruce hasn't been in Gotham
for three years, you know that.

166
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,440
- Yeah, but he's back now.
- No, he's not.

167
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,400
- I'm pretty sure he is.
- Trust me, I'd know.

168
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,560
Maybe just leave it on his desk.

169
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,800
Will do.

170
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,040
- Where are you?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

171
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,240
Needless to say,

172
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,840
this is not what
Wayne's advanced weaponry vault

173
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,040
should look like.

174
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,440
The tech in here is top secret.

175
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,320
If something was taken, it's bad.

176
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,160
Had to be Alice's gang, right?

177
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,600
Did you pull the security footage?

178
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,880
They jammed the cameras.

179
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
It'll take a minute to figure out
what they took,

180
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,800
but in the meantime, I'll call Bruce

181
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,120
and tell him what happened.

182
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,960
And you really expect him
to answer?

183
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,720
One of his properties containing

184
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
millions of dollars' worth
of weaponry was compromised.

185
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,320
But if something was gonna get
Bruce's attention, it'd be this.

186
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,920
- What is this?
- Not yours.

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,200
Two-way grappling hook.

188
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,560
Okay. Twice the hook,
twice the chance for disaster.

189
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,880
<i>Possible 10-54 Gotham City Gazette.</i>

190
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,360
10-4 on the Gazette. Clear the area.

191
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,600
- We're en route now.
<i>- Code ten.</i>

192
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,560
I need you to stay back
and figure out what they took.

193
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
- I'll check this out.
- Okay.

194
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,120
I can't believe
this is happening in the city.

195
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,800
Where are the Crows, we need them!

196
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,640
Who did this to Batman?

197
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,880
<i>I tried to be Batman, Bruce,</i>

198
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,880
<i>and I drew out your enemies
in the process.</i>

199
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,200
<i>Today it's an effigy.</i>

200
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,920
<i>But what happens when your
enemies start to kill real people</i>

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,240
<i>in order to draw you out?</i>

202
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,800
<i>The Gotham you set out to protect
is now less safe because of me.</i>

203
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,160
<i>So, what's the deal, Batman?</i>

204
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,080
<i>Are we really gonna let some loser</i>

205
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,880
<i>with a party store gift card</i>

206
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,280
<i>and way too much time
on his hands win this one?</i>

207
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,640
<i>Step out of the shadows
and into the ring.</i>

208
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,920
<i>Gotham needs you.</i>

209
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,520
- Hey.
- Hey.

210
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,800
So you're really doing nothing
for my game.

211
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,760
Is there any chance that you could...

212
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,440
I'm kind of looking
for my future husband over here.

213
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,440
Unfortunately, the Commander
was pretty specific.

214
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,840
We keep A-list clients
within ten to 15ft.

215
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,960
Joy.

216
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,200
Biochemistry?

217
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,680
Not exactly fodder for small talk
at Kylie Q's Jam Glam party.

218
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,080
Med student?

219
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,040
I kind of thought
you went to med school

220
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,320
to "look for your future husband."

221
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,320
So is my dad forcing Kate
to have a pocket Crow

222
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,840
or is it just me?

223
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,440
He figured since
she'd been offered a job with us

224
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,080
that it wasn't necessary.

225
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,840
That is so not fair.

226
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,080
So why didn't she take
the Crows job?

227
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,240
I have no idea.

228
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,760
I mean, she finally gets offered
a position

229
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,960
she spent five years training for
and doesn't take it?

230
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,400
Doesn't make sense.

231
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,640
You know Kate.

232
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,960
She is crazy.

233
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,200
So what is she doing with herself?

234
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,240
I hear she keeps late hours too.

235
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,000
So are you on this assignment
to keep tabs on me or on Kate?

236
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:11,080
Because I'm getting a very
distinctive "jealous ex" vibe.

237
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,520
I told her to move on.

238
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,080
You wanna know why Kate's not a Crow?

239
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,760
It's because you're a Crow.

240
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,280
It's because five years of training

241
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,560
was easier to walk away from

242
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,400
than going to work with the girl
who broke her heart.

243
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,400
The Batsuit is made
of a military-grade Kevlar

244
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,280
woven with enriched carbon nanotubes

245
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,280
- of my dad's own design!
- You're screaming.

246
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,840
- What?
- You're screaming!

247
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,440
Oh, sorry.

248
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,000
This is a Desert Eagle
Mark Nine 50 A-E.

249
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,080
One of the most powerful handguns
in the world.

250
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
It can literally blast a hole
through anything.

251
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,480
- Doesn't make a dent.
- Yeah.

252
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,840
You know, it stings a little.

253
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,760
- Just for reference.
- This...

254
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,440
is a rail gun.

255
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,240
It turns out this is what
the thieves took from Wayne R&D.

256
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,840
It has a parallel conductor
that generates a pulsed force

257
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,280
of electromagnetism,

258
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,040
accelerating the velocity
of the projectile.

259
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,800
It's the most lethal weapon
that Bruce ever had built.

260
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,240
This is a prototype,

261
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,360
but for demonstration purposes...

262
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,440
You're gonna fix that, right?

263
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,160
It's the only gun
that can shoot a shot

264
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,640
strong enough to penetrate the suit.

265
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,080
Bruce had it built
in case the suit fell

266
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,200
into the wrong hands.

267
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,800
Whoever's in possession
of the gun can kill Batman.

268
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,480
I put on this suit.
I dragged out one of his enemies.

269
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,160
Or maybe Alice doesn't like you

270
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,880
having her boy toy strung to a pipe.

271
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,520
If she has the gun,
she levels the playing field.

272
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,960
Except Alice doesn't know
that Bruce Wayne is Batman.

273
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,400
Whoever stole the gun
knew that Bruce had to have

274
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,760
- the suit to test it on.
- Yeah.

275
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,120
They know that Bruce is Batman.

276
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,480
Let me show you something.

277
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,160
He's an entitled one-percent jerk.

278
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,840
Now, he's inviting you to show off
his new douche chateau. Point?

279
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,280
The invitation wasn't for me.
It was for Bruce.

280
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,720
Tommy is adamant
that he's back in town.

281
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,640
- Why would he think that?
- Because if Batman's back,

282
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,760
Bruce is too.

283
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,880
Tommy's parents
were in that car accident.

284
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,560
Batman pulled his mom from the fire.

285
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,080
- Why would he want to kill him?
- No idea.

286
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
I'll go ask.

287
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,000
Or you could be Batman.

288
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,280
Sorry, that just sounded like
Mr. That's-Not-Meant-For-You

289
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,800
wants me to put the suit back on.

290
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,240
If Tommy did steal the gun,
he's trying to intimidate Batman.

291
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,080
Go show him the Bat's
not afraid of anyone.

292
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,440
- He has that.
- And you have that.

293
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,760
And an entire city behind you.
That includes me.

294
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,320
Knowing Bruce,
if he built a rail gun,

295
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,800
he built something that can stop it.

296
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,640
And I will figure out how to use it.

297
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,760
You're stronger than this guy,
Kate. Go kick his butt.

298
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,240
And if I can't,
I let down an entire city.

299
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,800
I'm not Batman, Luke.

300
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,080
<i>All posts, we are on crisis alert.</i>

301
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,880
Hey, what are you doing?

302
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,360
Alice, wait, wait!

303
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,800
Kate's gonna be so disappointed.

304
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
Elliot party.

305
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,800
Hey.

306
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,440
What is happening here?

307
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,000
Your dad assigned me
as Mary's security detail.

308
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,000
- That sucks.
- No kidding.

309
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,120
But what was I supposed to do?

310
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,280
Miss the party of the weekend

311
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,480
because I got a full-time babysitter?

312
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,280
Can't have the Queen of Gotham's
party scene

313
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,600
go radio silent on socials.

314
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,600
What about you, Kate?

315
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,880
What brings you
to an adult frat house?

316
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,120
I was told to move on.

317
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,720
We get it, Tommy,
could you live any higher?

318
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,760
What can I get you?

319
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,720
Just looking for the man of the hour.

320
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,840
He's around.

321
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,320
But if you wanna save yourself

322
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,160
from a verbal carwash
of veiled misogyny,

323
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,560
you might wanna plant yourself
here, he'll be by soon.

324
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,360
In that case, I will have a beer.

325
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,160
I'm Reagan, by the way.

326
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,160
Kate Kane. I thought that was you.

327
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,320
Tyler. We met a few weeks ago.

328
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,960
Sophie's husband. I remember.

329
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,240
You know, I hate these things.

330
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,840
Guy has ten contracts with The Crows

331
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,520
so we all come here to kiss his ass.

332
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,080
Well, at least you get to work
with your wife.

333
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,960
Yeah, you know, speaking of,

334
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,000
I didn't catch how you and Sophie
know each other.

335
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,680
- What do you mean?
- Well, she never told me

336
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,920
she was friends
with the boss's daughter.

337
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,880
- She didn't tell you who I am?
- No.

338
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,960
I'm the Kate. From Point Rock.

339
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,840
Oh, you went to the academy together.

340
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,400
Right. That explains it.

341
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,360
That explains it.

342
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,080
Oh, boss is here.

343
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,880
You have a nice night,
Kate from Point Rock.

344
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,120
He married your ex and has no idea.

345
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,440
Wow, you're good.

346
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,000
Professional level.

347
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,800
Started bartending
before I could drink.

348
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,600
- You learn to read people.
- All right.

349
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,360
- Read him for me.
- Tommy Elliott?

350
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,880
Danger, hazardous waste.

351
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,400
King of Real Estate,
thinks he's doing us all a favor

352
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,040
when he really just helps
fund the walls

353
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,960
that are separating our city.

354
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,120
- Gotham, am I right?
- Yeah.

355
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,560
Thank goodness.

356
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,120
Someone who loathes
Tommy Elliott as much as me.

357
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,800
Isn't he one of your biggest clients?

358
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,600
Unfortunately.

359
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,880
Well, I'm glad you're here, Kate.

360
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,200
It means you're not out
gallivanting with Alice.

361
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,360
You would tell me

362
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,040
if she'd reached out
to you again, right?

363
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,280
I don't think Alice
is gonna be a problem today.

364
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,000
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Twin instincts.

365
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,040
Mum.

366
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,600
Security detail? Seriously?

367
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,160
Unfortunately, this is the world
we're living in now.

368
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,880
Well, I need my world to have
a little bit more elbow room.

369
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,000
I can't even reapply lip gloss
without poked by an AK.

370
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,880
Nice view of Wayne Tower.

371
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,840
Well, took half my life,

372
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,480
but I'm finally looking down
on Bruce Wayne.

373
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,560
What makes you think he's back?

374
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
We're cosmic besties.

375
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,560
And here I thought
I was his favorite cousin

376
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,680
and not even a phone call.

377
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,560
- Oh, he's a busy man.
- You're right.

378
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,560
He's probably preoccupied
with the break-in at Wayne R&D.

379
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,760
They stole a specialized firearm.

380
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,720
That sucks.

381
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,000
Good news is, the morons who
took it probably didn't realize

382
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,760
there's a hidden GPS tracker
inside the device.

383
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,760
And it's only a matter of time

384
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,920
before Wayne Security
come knocking at their door.

385
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,840
Kane.

386
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,760
Who is this?

387
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,120
You taught me. Remember?

388
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,000
<i>Or did you give up music
like you gave up on me?</i>

389
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,400
What are you trying to do, Alice?
You're not getting in my head.

390
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,000
You'd be surprised
where I can get into, Commander.

391
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,360
Where are you?

392
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,040
Well, I could tell you
but that would ruin the surprise.

393
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,800
Let's talk until you're finished
tracing my call.

394
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,920
I never understood
why you stopped looking for me.

395
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,320
I always thought a father
would do anything

396
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,880
to find his daughter.

397
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,200
<i>Swim oceans, move mountains.
But now I get it.</i>

398
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,760
You're on top of the mountain.

399
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,960
If I had this view,
I'd stop looking for me too.

400
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,680
<i>More time to enjoy your new life.</i>

401
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,040
How did you get in my house?

402
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,920
You should be ashamed, Commander.

403
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,120
King of the Crows
can't even protect your own nest.

404
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,520
I'm coming for you.

405
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,960
Maybe if you uttered those words
15-years-ago,

406
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,400
<i>we wouldn't be here now.</i>

407
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,800
I won't let you forget me,
Commander. Not again.

408
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,640
We need to leave now.

409
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,400
- What is it?
- I'll explain downstairs.

410
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,760
Kane to Moore.

411
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,080
Get Kate and Mary in an armored truck

412
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,680
- until I deal with something.
- Copy that.

413
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,360
- Mary.
- What's happening?

414
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,760
Okay. All right. Okay.

415
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,120
- Where's Kate?
- She probably left.

416
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
I'll text her.

417
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,920
That's some gun you got there.

418
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,080
Party's not in here, Candy Kane.

419
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,880
It's over, Tommy.
This isn't yours, just...

420
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,720
You don't wanna get in my way.

421
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,120
- How do you know who he is?
- You mean Batman?

422
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,440
Did I say that out loud?

423
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,560
How do you know that?

424
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh, because a few months ago

425
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,560
I paid a man to riddle me the answer.

426
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,480
Gotta love the honorable Bruce Wayne

427
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,800
for designing a failsafe

428
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,640
so he can never become
too powerful in his super suit.

429
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,160
He is such a great guy.

430
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,160
- He's your best friend.
- Yeah, he was.

431
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,240
The bestest.

432
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,680
Nothing could be average with Bruce,

433
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,640
even had to have
more dead parents than me.

434
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,480
Because he saved your mom's life.

435
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,400
Oh, yeah, no, I am aware.

436
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,200
Thanks to him, instead
of collecting my inheritance,

437
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,560
I was left wiping the spittle
of a jabbering madwoman's lips

438
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,040
for 13 years.

439
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,440
If you wanted him dead, why wait

440
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,080
until he's in a bullet proof suit?

441
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,520
Because Bruce didn't ruin my life.

442
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,880
Batman did.

443
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,880
Do you know what it's like
to have the villain of your story

444
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
be the hero of your city?

445
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,720
He is a monster who left me anchored

446
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,960
to a repulsive gold-digging bitch.

447
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,240
And now he's gonna die.

448
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,240
Well, that answers that.

449
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,880
Bruce's is bigger.

450
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
What did you do?

451
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,400
You let Batman meet me on the roof,

452
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,520
or the elevators I just hijacked,
they start to drop.

453
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,840
- Batman isn't here.
- Yeah, because he's hiding.

454
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,560
It's time for Gotham's hero
to man up.

455
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,520
Next one's in an hour.

456
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,720
It will look like this,

457
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,120
but with people the city
will actually miss.

458
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,600
Oh, my God.

459
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,280
It's my leg...

460
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,880
I'm so sorry.

461
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,080
You're gonna be okay.

462
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,200
Help him.

463
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,680
I'm gonna check
all the elevators.

464
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,000
- I swear I heard something crash.
- Yeah, me too.

465
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,400
Does anyone have reception?

466
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,720
Moore to Base. Check, check. Hello?

467
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,760
How is our signal dead?

468
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,680
Hello? FYI,
I'm a social media influencer.

469
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,280
So if you people
don't want a scathing review

470
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,640
of your building safety,
you should hop to it!

471
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,720
No service. I hope Mary's okay.

472
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,160
Why did you pull us out of there?

473
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,480
- Alice.
- Alice?

474
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,480
Is she the reason
we're stuck right now?

475
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,680
Very well could be.

476
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,320
She just called me.

477
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,480
From our penthouse.

478
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,440
What?

479
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,720
I swear if this is Alice,
I'm gonna be so pissed.

480
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,160
They'll find us, babe.

481
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
Oh, my God.

482
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
What?

483
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,640
Nothing. I just totally forgot
you two were married.

484
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,280
Three years,
but still full of surprises.

485
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,360
Saw Kate inside.

486
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,720
You two went to Point Rock
together?

487
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,360
Yeah. We did. Why?

488
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,400
Was it a secret or something?

489
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,280
No. Why would it be a secret?

490
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,040
I don't know
why would you never mention her?

491
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,240
She's our boss's daughter.

492
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,440
Didn't I mention her?

493
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,480
- No, Soph, you didn't.
- I don't know.

494
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,680
We weren't that close.
Never occurred to me.

495
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
Anyone wanna try prying
open the doors?

496
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,760
- How the hell did she get inside?
- I have no idea.

497
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,240
How can the city trust us
to protect it

498
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,200
when we can't even
keep ourselves safe?

499
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,080
- We'll contain it.
- We should've "contained" Alice

500
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,560
- when we had the chance.
- Trust me, that was the plan!

501
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,760
But Kate threatened
to cut me out of her life.

502
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,960
What was I supposed to do?

503
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,760
All right, I'll go
and help pull you out, okay?

504
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,600
All right, we should split up
and see if anyone else is stuck.

505
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,760
Okay.

506
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,040
- I knew...
- I didn't say anything.

507
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,960
Why are you here?
He's gonna drop another one.

508
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,480
I know that,
all those people are hurt

509
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,000
because I put the suit on.

510
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,200
- It's not your fault, Kate.
- It is, Luke. It is my fault.

511
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,440
I brought this to Gotham.

512
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,960
Tommy today,
someone else tomorrow.

513
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,040
This is on me.

514
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,640
You said if something
was gonna get Bruce's attention,

515
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
it would be this.

516
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,960
I need you to be real with me.

517
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,280
Do you think he's coming back?

518
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,400
- Luke.
- No.

519
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,080
Tommy wants Batman.
The city needs Batman.

520
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,480
And I'm not Batman.

521
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,960
But maybe I'm better
because I'm here.

522
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,200
How long is that gonna take
to fix?

523
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,400
There aren't enough.

524
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,440
- What?
- EMTs.

525
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,840
Ma'am, how are you feeling?

526
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,640
Ma'am?

527
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,440
Any head pain? Headache?

528
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,240
This woman needs help now.

529
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,640
- We already checked her.
- Well, check her again!

530
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,000
Mary, they're professionals.
You're a second year med student.

531
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,560
She's got a headache
and a blown pupil.

532
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,680
Could be a subdural
or epidural hemorrhage.

533
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,400
- I read ahead.
- You're right. Thanks.

534
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,400
<i>Your friend Tommy
wants to kill you Bruce.</i>

535
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,960
<i>And since you're not here...</i>

536
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,800
<i>it looks like I'm gonna have
to kick his butt on your behalf.</i>

537
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,600
<i>And send a message to anyone else
who'd come after you.</i>

538
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,960
<i>But to do that, I need to be
honest with the city...</i>

539
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,080
<i>that I'm not you.</i>

540
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,560
<i>I'm me.</i>

541
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,240
You're not Batman.

542
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,640
That's the point.

543
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,080
Who the hell are you?

544
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,200
I want Batman, not his side piece.

545
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
I found Tommy.

546
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,760
Activate the disruptor
on your gauntlet.

547
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,000
<i>When the light flashes green,
his gun will neutralize.</i>

548
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,400
- Yeah, that's not happening.
- Did you charge the glove?

549
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,400
- Wait, what?
- Where's Batman?

550
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,680
Okay, I activated the charge.
You need to stall for 30 seconds.

551
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,280
Stalling.

552
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,480
I'm done with you.

553
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,720
No!

554
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,520
- What the hell was that?
- Don't move. It's not stable.

555
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,880
What the hell was that?

556
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,400
See you at the bottom.

557
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,080
Let go.

558
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
Red wig?

559
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,920
And I'm the crazy one.

560
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,560
You saved my life.

561
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,520
Guess we're even.

562
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,720
This place is crawling with Crows.

563
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,480
You shouldn't be here.

564
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,400
Well, I came to crash the party.
Turns out our host beat me to it.

565
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,240
I didn't know
that it was a costume party.

566
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,360
Let me guess.

567
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,120
Red.

568
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,920
The color of our birthstone.

569
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,720
To remind us where we came from.

570
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,440
About that...

571
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,600
They say if you wanna quit,
you have to really want to.

572
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,440
And, well, I didn't want to.

573
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,600
You see,
24 hours is a really long time.

574
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,560
Guess you're gonna have
to let my sweet Dodgson die.

575
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,440
Like I said...

576
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,960
Beth is gone.

577
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,680
Then why save me?

578
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,040
Because I have plans for you, Kate.

579
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,880
And that it's no fun
torturing a corpse.

580
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,320
Believe me, I've tried.

581
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,520
Any who, good luck on the upkeep.

582
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,040
If you think Tommy was annoying,
wait until your roots grow in.

583
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,200
If you kill again, it's over.

584
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,080
And I will stop thinking of you
as my sister.

585
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,720
You're finally catching on.

586
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,960
That is exactly what I want.

587
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,840
You say that, but it's not true.

588
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,120
And I know you know that too.

589
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,720
Right money in the right hands,
I will be out in an hour.

590
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,320
They're taking you to Arkham,
Tommy.

591
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,040
Good luck buying your way out
of that.

592
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,080
You tell Bruce that I won't stop
until he shows his face!

593
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,960
- Reagan.
- Hey.

594
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,960
- Hey.
- There you are.

595
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,680
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I guess...

596
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,360
Tommy's a bigger jerk than I thought.

597
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,360
So that whole I can read
people thing?

598
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,880
Yeah, so you're into me.

599
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:23,080
I mean, you would know.
You're the professional.

600
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,920
- Cool. I'll call you, then.
- I'd like that.

601
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,920
Catherine? Catherine.

602
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,360
There you are.

603
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,840
You okay?

604
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Alice broke into our home
and murdered that guard.

605
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,440
- You have to stop her, Jacob.
- I know.

606
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,920
- We're gonna find her.
- And put an end to this!

607
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,200
When Alice called, she was
playing a song on Beth's cello.

608
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,440
Bach.

609
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,040
I used to tell Beth it was our song.

610
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,200
She could've found
one of Beth's recitals online.

611
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,080
You're smarter than that, Jacob.

612
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,000
Jacob, don't let her in.

613
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,200
<i>I wasn't afraid of letting down
the city.</i>

614
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,720
<i>I was afraid of letting down you,
Bruce.</i>

615
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,920
<i>But whatever happens,
whatever I face...</i>

616
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,520
<i>It's worth it.</i>

617
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,640
<i>Okay, Gotham.</i>

618
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,800
<i>Someone just dropped a bombshell
on this city,</i>

619
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,160
<i>and I mean that literally.</i>

620
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,680
<i>The Bat is back.
Just curvier and sexier!</i>

621
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,000
<i>So, the big question,
what are we calling her?</i>

622
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,120
<i>Batlady? Batchick?</i>

623
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,160
<i>Talk to me Gotham, we need a name.</i>

624
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,200
Batwoman.
