1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,080
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,200
To Catherine

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,200
the most extraordinary woman.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,280
You should have first looked

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,560
to see whether
it's marked "poison" or not.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,920
Jacob would never hurt us.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,760
You know how she died? Exactly
the way that Alice planned it.

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,720
Hands in the air, Kane.
You're under arrest.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,720
What the hell is happening?
Get your hands off of me!

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,680
You had someone impersonate him.
The Skin Pirate.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,920
I'm gonna ask you again, Kate.
Is Alice worth it?

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,360
Wasn't that our train?

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,480
What the hell?

14
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,480
That's my stop.
He missed my stop completely.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,760
Hey, Keanu!

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,400
Some of us have tickets
to <i>Jagged Little Phil...</i>

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,720
That's not right.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,080
<i>Attention, ladies and gentlemen,
it appears our computer system</i>

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,240
<i>has stopped responding.
We've lost our brakes.</i>

20
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,680
<i>This is not a drill.
Brace for impact.</i>

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,480
Conductor sent GCPD an SOS
five minutes ago

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,640
that his brakes went out.

23
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,280
At his rate of speed and taking

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,160
<i>into consideration rush
hour passenger weight</i>

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,240
<i>on a 650 volt three-rail system,</i>

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,520
<i>they've got about half a mile
of track before they get</i>

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,800
<i>to the end of the line.</i>

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,360
Didn't hear what I
just said, did you?

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,680
I love this bike.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,400
<i>Figured you couldn't exactly
have the same ride as Kate Kane.</i>

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,640
<i>Agree. But it's not
my birthday for two days.</i>

32
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
Birthday?

33
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,600
You had no idea?

34
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,120
- Yes, so the next stop should be...
<i>- Got it.</i>

35
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,600
Look out!

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,760
I got you, ma'am.

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Ma'am?

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,560
Oh, boy.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,520
<i>Good morning, Gotham.</i>

40
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,840
<i>After the death of Oliver Queen</i>

41
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,120
<i>I think we all needed
a reason to smile.</i>

42
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,280
<i>And we've been getting it
all week.</i>

43
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,680
<i>A bombshell caped crusader
and a cop with Chris Evan vibes?</i>

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,880
{\an5}<i>Talk to me Gotham, are we
shipping these two or what?</i>

45
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,920
{\an5}Congrats, your street cred's
off the chart right now.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,600
Officer Slam Bradley
is as hometown hero as it gets.

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,360
{\an5}Why is this guy suddenly
everywhere that I am?

48
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,840
{\an5}Well, GCPD is probably
stepping up their game

49
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,480
{\an5}now, that the head
of The Crows is in jail.

50
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,600
{\an5}Slam is Mr. March in the annual
hunks of the GCPD calendar.

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,320
{\an5}Handcuffs are a nice touch.

52
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,080
Well, I got to say,
I can't really blame people

53
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,840
for shipping you and Captain America.

54
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,040
{\an5}Have we not had this conversation?

55
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,560
- I'm very, very gay.
- Have you not seen Batwoman?

56
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,920
Major straight vibes.

57
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,920
Kate, it's not a total negative.

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
Oh, that I'm apparently dating
Mr. Underwear

59
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,200
that leaves nothing
to the imagination?

60
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,800
{\an5}That Gotham's confused.

61
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,520
{\an5}It's misinformation.
The less they know about you

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,040
{\an5}the easier it is
to keep you a secret.

63
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,320
{\an5}A train lost its breaks.

64
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,920
{\an5}And I saved 450 people from
smashing into a concrete wall.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,480
And all Gotham cares about
is Batwoman's sex life.

66
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,160
- They just want to see you're happy.
- Well, too bad because she is not.

67
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,320
{\an5}Fill up your glasses
as quick as you can

68
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,240
{\an5}and sprinkle the table
with buttons and bran.

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,560
{\an5}Put cats in the coffee
and the mice in the tea.

70
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,560
{\an5}And welcome Queen Alice
with 30 times three.

71
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,240
Oh, Catherine,
do tell me if it's too weak.

72
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
What's that, dear?

73
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,080
Too bitter.

74
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,920
Then it's perfect.

75
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,280
Now, back to sleep.

76
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,320
Nighty night.

77
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,680
{\an5}It's such a shame our dear sister
couldn't join us today.

78
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,480
{\an5}I guess that would require her
taking one of your calls...

79
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,080
Or answering a text,

80
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,840
or a letter,

81
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,800
or a cryptic gift.

82
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,520
- Your tea's getting cold.
- I am getting cold.

83
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,800
{\an5}Perhaps we should resume this

84
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,080
{\an5}when the condition are
more favorable to celebration.

85
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,880
Catherine Hamilton is dead.

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,280
The sunshine is implied.

87
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
Look,

88
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,680
Alice...

89
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,120
I know you have this fantasy

90
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,280
that the three of us
are going to be a family one day,

91
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,240
but Kate doesn't.

92
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,600
{\an5}I killed our mutual enemy for her.

93
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,600
She'll come around.

94
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,400
{\an5}That's not a gesture of love to her.

95
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,480
It's a weakness.

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,320
{\an5}It's another strand
in your unraveling psychosis.

97
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,560
{\an5}She doesn't see her sister.

98
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,120
{\an5}She sees a soul in need of saving.

99
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
{\an5}She's the city's hero.

100
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,640
{\an5}The city's hero can't be seen
sipping tea with fugitive dreck.

101
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,440
{\an5}As long as she wears that mask

102
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,200
you're never going to bring her
into this family.

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
Hey, guys.

104
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,120
So this may come as news
to some of you

105
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,640
but my Insta account's
not actually a place for you

106
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,080
to list all the ways
that I'm human garbage.

107
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,400
My stepdad's a murderer

108
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,480
my mom's company is corrupt,

109
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,640
we're all evil, got it.

110
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,040
Loud and clear.

111
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,920
And since there is not enough
bandwith on the internet for me

112
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,360
to explain all of the ways
that you're wrong...

113
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,960
I'm gonna sign off for a bit.

114
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,040
Be better to each other. Seriously.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,040
Peace.

116
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,200
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

117
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,840
I know and you didn't mean for your
twin sister to poison my mother,

118
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,760
but we all know how that turned out.

119
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,280
I just... I wanted to let you know

120
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,360
that I put in a call to Hewitt
and Associates.

121
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,080
I figured that an extra
legal team wouldn't hurt.

122
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,640
Yeah, I know. Which is why
they've all been hired.

123
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,800
Thanks, but we got this.

124
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,400
- We?
- Your dad, Sophie and me.

125
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Your dad has every lawyer
in Gotham on retainer,

126
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,640
Sophie built a strike team
to try to find Mouse

127
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
and I am looking
for a plastic surgeon

128
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,280
willing to testify that face
replacement is a great way

129
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,120
- to frame someone for murder.
- Okay. How can I help?

130
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,520
You can tell your sister to stop
defiling my mom's grave.

131
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,800
Wow, I...

132
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,320
She's been looking for a way
to get my attention.

133
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,320
She thinks that I want to be sisters.

134
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,080
Isn't that what you wanted?

135
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,800
Look, if you want to help,

136
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,840
tell your sister
to leave my dead mother alone.

137
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,320
She'll listen to you, right?

138
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,480
Wait.

139
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,440
- Mary, I am so sorry.
- I know. I know you are.

140
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,760
I know you never wanted to believe

141
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,760
that your sister could be capable
of doing something so horrible,

142
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
but I did.

143
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,960
And you decided to ignore me.

144
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,520
So I'm really busy...

145
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
Bye.

146
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,120
Yeah.

147
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,640
Here. Put this on.

148
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
We're officials
for the Transit Authority.

149
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,560
Ever since the Scarecrow incident,

150
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,800
Gotham City trains run
on an independent analog system.

151
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,240
In theory, that should
make them unhackable.

152
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,720
- Suicidal conductor?
- GCPD already released him.

153
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,240
Black box data showed
no indication of engineer error.

154
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,960
It was like the train's brake system
got possessed or something.

155
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,040
Please don't touch that.

156
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
Great.

157
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,440
That made this harder
by about a 100 percent.

158
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,840
This help?

159
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,040
That could, theoretically, have
something to do with it.

160
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,840
Yeah, it's a packet analyzer.

161
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,720
It intercepts and jumbles traffic as
it passes over a digital network.

162
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,000
the hacker probably used it to hijack
the train's brakes remotely.

163
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,000
<i>I love to dig.</i>

164
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,840
<i>Because when I dig, I found
all the secrets you buried.</i>

165
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,880
- Did you just get...
- The same thing.

166
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,640
<i>If I can hack your subway,
I can hack your phone</i>

167
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,240
<i>computer, home security cameras.</i>

168
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,800
<i>Did I get your attention? Good.</i>

169
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,240
<i>Now, crowdfund my escape from
Gotham.</i>

170
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,920
<i>Click the link and help me raise
five million dollars</i>

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,120
<i>by midnight on Friday,
or your secrets come out.</i>

172
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,880
<i>It doesn't matter
if you are a porn addict,</i>

173
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,640
<i>masked vigilante, or everyday
Joe Schmo. Pay up, Gotham.</i>

174
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,960
Mayor, are you calling this
a terrorist attack?

175
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,440
Sir, how wide-spread
is this cyber breach?

176
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,360
Folks, please, just let me speak.

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,280
First and foremost, Gotham City
has no reason to be alarmed.

178
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,520
We have layers of cyber security
in place

179
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,240
and we will certainly not be coerced

180
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,080
into the demand
of some silly prankster.

181
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,160
<i>I encourage everyone to go
about their daily activities.</i>

182
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,200
<i>Authorities will work it
around the clock</i>

183
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,720
<i>to ensure that this
never happens again.</i>

184
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
- You're kidding me.
- This guy is good.

185
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,320
<i>If you're so safe,</i>

186
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,480
<i>why</i>are<i>the Mayor's
personal credit card numbers</i>

187
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,160
<i>flashing across the screen?</i>

188
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,120
<i>Go shopping, Gotham</i>

189
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,480
- What are you doing?
- Shutting us down.

190
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,840
Guy just doxed the Mayor. We're one
hack away from total exposure.

191
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,360
With this on the firewall?

192
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,560
The guy just hijacked the subway,
the city's cell network

193
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
- and overtook a feed on live TV.
- So?

194
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,840
So you're the most famous person
in Gotham right now.

195
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,560
You don't think
you're the obvious target here?

196
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,200
Come from the genius
who puts a bat emoji

197
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,760
on every single text messages.

198
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,640
That was just cold.

199
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,640
Look, can you just use this
to trace the IP address

200
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,200
- and find the user's location?
- I could, if we had internet.

201
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,040
- Don't do it.
- We can't stop him

202
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
if we can't find him.

203
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,400
We can't stop anyone
if everyone knows who you are.

204
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,600
- Please.
- Seriously, don't.

205
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,600
- Five minutes, then we go dark.
- Fine.

206
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,240
Fine.

207
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,880
Food is getting cold, Commander Kane.

208
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,280
Where is your bite, puppy dog?

209
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,960
Some classic ass poetry about the man
who locked up half the fools in here

210
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,480
is now, eating
out of the same doggie bowl.

211
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,760
Welcome home.

212
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,560
Help yourself.

213
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,680
So after all that, we're able
to pull up your hearing week.

214
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,000
Because the last thing we need

215
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,040
<i>is to start your trial
on Valentine's day</i>

216
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,520
<i>with the bunch of jurors thinking
about the significant others</i>

217
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,240
<i>while hearing the DA's theory
on how you killed yours.</i>

218
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,480
But less great news, I'm still
working on finding a medical expert

219
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,080
willing to testify that
face-swapping is totally a thing.

220
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,840
- Mary...
- <i>Dr. Keller is supposedly</i>

221
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,280
on sabbatical aka he's just too
scared to be associate with you

222
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,680
and apparently, Professor Vivek

223
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,040
<i>is too good for us now, that
he's been on Dr. Phil...</i>

224
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Mary, stop.

225
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,280
<i>You mother has been killed</i>

226
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,880
and Gotham thinks I killed her,
it's incomprehensible.

227
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,440
How are you dealing with everything?

228
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,080
I'm engaging in escapist
strategies as a defense tactic

229
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,720
so that all the walls holding up
everything I know to be true

230
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,520
don't come crumbling down around me.

231
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,200
Mary, Kate and I think
you need to talk to someone.

232
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,960
Like who? You?
You wanted to divorce my mom.

233
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,840
Your mother and I had a fundamental
difference of opinion.

234
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,160
I've never stopped
wanting to be your dad.

235
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,480
I don't have time to sit around
feeling sorry for myself.

236
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,480
So we need to find Alice,

237
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,680
force a confession
and get you out of there.

238
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,880
<i>Sit tight. I will find somebody
to help us.</i>

239
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,280
Okay, the trace on the device worked.

240
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,440
This place is definitely
giving me <i>Mr. Robot</i> vibes.

241
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,680
- Batwoman to Batcave.
- Luke.

242
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,080
You turned the comms off.

243
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,200
One of you needs to start talking.

244
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,360
We've been surveilling
this operation for months.

245
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,840
Up until last night
you were just rejects

246
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,360
working for a Russian hacking ring

247
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,360
who got off on stealing social
security checks from old ladies.

248
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,040
- So, why hijack a subway?
- We didn't do that.

249
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,160
We're not terrorists.

250
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,400
Oh, now, you wanna talk.

251
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,720
So, which one of you
cut the brakes on the train?

252
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,960
I swear, none of us.

253
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,800
My wife takes the train to work every
morning. I'd never do that to...

254
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,400
Which one of you cut the brakes?

255
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,920
I promise you on
my mother's grave, it wasn't us.

256
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,840
- Please don't kill me.
- Then answer the damn question!

257
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,280
I know you're there.

258
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,320
Want to talk about it?

259
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,920
Not really.

260
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
I get it.

261
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,760
Maybe some other time.

262
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,400
You ever feel like you're
hiding from the world?

263
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,400
I'm literally standing in the shadow.

264
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,440
Not sure why I'm asking someone

265
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,960
who crushes on Slam Bradley
for life advice.

266
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
Try me.

267
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,800
My husband left me.

268
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,040
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,240
He thinks I'm lying to myself.

270
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
Are you?

271
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Maybe.

272
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,680
Maybe I'm too terrified
to deal with it.

273
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,520
We all wear masks.

274
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,120
Maybe it's time you take yours off.

275
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,480
You're one to talk.

276
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,760
- Dr. Campbell.
- Mary.

277
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,160
Are you okay?

278
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,520
I am so sorry to hear about your mom.

279
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,680
That night at the Gala
was absolutely horrific.

280
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,720
Thank you. I know that you're busy
and I don't mean to ambush you

281
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,840
after a three-hour college lecture
but I read your dissertation

282
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,760
on skin grafts and facial restoration

283
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,280
and wondered if you'd be willing
to be an expert witness

284
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,080
in my step dad's trial.

285
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,040
I'm sorry, I'm not following.

286
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,280
He was set up by a guy
who made a face out of real skin

287
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,640
that looks exactly like Jacob Kane.

288
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,160
Look, I know what it sounds like.

289
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,160
And you think that I'm in denial
and grasping at straws

290
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,680
and, yes, I've seen
every episode of <i>Dateline</i>

291
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,240
and know the husband always
does it, but not this time.

292
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,040
Look, your mother was really
generous to Gotham University

293
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,880
and I wish I could help. But

294
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,160
for a man to perfectly
resemble another man, it's...

295
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,120
It's science fiction, Mary.

296
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,920
I know what I saw.

297
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,280
Sometimes when...

298
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,040
People under extreme duress, they

299
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,920
see what they wanna see.

300
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,120
I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.

301
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,000
I really am.

302
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Good night.

303
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,360
You turned off the comms?

304
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
We went dark,

305
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,560
that includes satellite feed.

306
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,000
And when you find the Terrier
Terrorist, I'll reconnect.

307
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,880
Until then, you're running solo.

308
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,720
The packet analyzer
was a diversion tactic.

309
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,760
Whoever planted it rerouted the
IP to some of Snowden wannabe.

310
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,200
So much for honor
among cyber thieves.

311
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Am I a fraud?

312
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,280
You're still hung up
on this Slam Bradley love affair?

313
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,680
Yeah, whenever I put on this suit,

314
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,960
I feel like I'm lying
to our entire city.

315
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Well, that's the job.

316
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,520
According to the multiverse,
my job is to be

317
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,120
the Paragon of Courage.

318
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,160
Right, because a Paragon
Finder said so

319
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,240
before the infinite earths collapsed
into a single space-time continuum.

320
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,960
I'm sure it was all very exciting.

321
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,600
I live in shadows, I wear a disguise

322
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,240
and I let people believe
that I'm dating Captain America.

323
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,240
What part of that is courageous?

324
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,600
Kicking bad guy's asses
to protect your city

325
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,040
is pretty damn courageous.

326
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,880
You said it yourself, I'm the
most famous face in Gotham.

327
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,760
But their image of me

328
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,360
is not me.

329
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,880
They think you're a hero, Kate.

330
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
You are.

331
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,240
This is gonna help you.
It's an electric charge disrupter.

332
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,080
It will kill every electric current

333
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,400
within 100m radius for ten seconds.

334
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,280
- How does that help us?
- Because whoever hacked Gotham,

335
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,000
probably has a firewall on her phone

336
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,280
strong enough to resist this.

337
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,800
So we narrow down her location,
kill the power

338
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,480
her phone stays on, boom...

339
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,360
You keep saying "her".

340
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,160
Right, I was just about
to get to that

341
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,400
consider us both guilty
of making assumptions.

342
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,600
So I did an offline reverse
audio modulation

343
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,000
on the talking terrier emoji to
access the hacker's actual voice.

344
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,400
<i>If I can hack your subway,</i>

345
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,040
<i>I can hack your phone, computer,
home security cameras.</i>

346
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,040
It's a girl. Like, a young girl.

347
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Play it again.

348
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,280
<i>If I can hack your subway,</i>

349
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,600
<i>- I can hack your phone,...</i>
- You hear that?

350
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,520
Lower the voice,
amplify the background.

351
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Okay.

352
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,200
<i>If I can hack your subway,
I can hack your phone...</i>

353
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,400
Right there, isolate that.

354
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,160
You heard that.

355
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,800
- That melodic tone?
- It's a bell.

356
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,240
I recognize it.

357
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,400
I know where she recorded this.

358
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,240
It's the most vile,
lawless place in the world.

359
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,200
Gotham Prep.

360
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,080
My old high school.

361
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,560
What'd Campbell say?

362
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,040
<i>Apparently, the psychological
ramifications of</i>

363
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,720
witnessing my mother's death
have caused me

364
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,760
to see and believe things
that are not there.

365
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,960
He thinks you're crazy.

366
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,480
Totally off my rocker.
Just like everyone else.

367
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,920
Look, Mary,
it's not my business, but...

368
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,200
Have you tried talking to Kate?

369
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,760
She lost her mom too.
She's been through this.

370
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,000
I know, which makes not trusting
her that much more tragic.

371
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,480
We'll find someone
who can help your dad.

372
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
<i>My cousin went to med school
in Metropolis,</i>

373
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
<i>maybe she knows a plastic surgeon...</i>

374
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,640
- Okay, that's creepy.
<i>- What?</i>

375
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,840
Alice is at Gotham University.

376
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,720
Are you sure?

377
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,120
The woman poisoned my mom,
then danced on her grave,

378
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,840
yes, I know what Alice looks like.

379
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,160
<i>Mary, get out of there now.
I'm sending a team.</i>

380
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,400
- Who's the Terrier?
- What just happened?

381
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,800
Is that Batwoman?

382
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,240
I asked who is the Terrier?

383
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,320
So not me, but do you mind?

384
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Batwoman crashed our party.
This is sick!

385
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,080
Is Slam Bradley here too?

386
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,000
- Bat-selfie. What's up?
- No.

387
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,480
You broke my phone?

388
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,160
Why did it just go dark?

389
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,960
Wait, what did you do
with our phones?

390
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,280
What happened.

391
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,720
My phone not working man?

392
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,920
What do you want?
I'm just a kid at a dance.

393
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,520
<i>If I can hack your subway,</i>

394
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,000
<i>I can hack your phone, computer,
home security cameras.</i>

395
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,880
A kid who hacked a subway
full of innocent people.

396
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,720
- You got a name?
- You don't know my name?

397
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,920
I thought you were
some bad-ass crime fighter.

398
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,920
Parker Torres.

399
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,680
And I wasn't gonna crash the train.

400
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,200
My grappling hook begs to differ.

401
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,360
I was on it,

402
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,520
controlling it from my phone.

403
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,200
I was gonna stop it,
but you stopped it first.

404
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,400
Whatever, it's a dumb prank.

405
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,960
What the hell were you thinking?

406
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,560
I'm sorry, okay?

407
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,440
- Chill.
- I don't chill.

408
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,800
Look...

409
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,240
I really am sorry.

410
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,480
I just thought if I could...

411
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,840
Scare my parents
into thinking I almost died,

412
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,160
they'd just be happy I was alive,

413
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,880
and forget their daughter
was a freak.

414
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,600
- You're not a freak.
- I am to them.

415
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,240
I'm a...

416
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,800
Gay.

417
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,880
Kayla Mason revenge outed me
to my mom and dad.

418
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,040
- Kayla Mason?
- My ex.

419
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,560
She said, being in the closet
was pre-historic.

420
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,680
I either told them the truth
or she'd leave me.

421
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,000
She didn't get it,
I couldn't tell the truth.

422
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,280
So when I told her to just go,

423
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,520
she went nuclear
and told my parents for me.

424
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,400
My mom and dad thought
they'd been raising

425
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,680
some BTS-loving heteronorm.

426
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,360
Now they sleep clutching rosaries
and want to disown me.

427
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,960
That's why I need the money
to get out of Gotham.

428
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,120
That's sucks and it's not fair.

429
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,080
But it is not an excuse to put
hundreds of lives in jeopardy...

430
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,920
My parents want me
to be someone I'm not.

431
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,080
Do you know how that feels?

432
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,200
I hate myself, okay?

433
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,200
And let's raincheck
your "It gets better" PSA.

434
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,160
We both know I'm gonna grow up
hiding my girlfriends

435
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,080
and aspiring to be represented

436
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,320
by an ancillary character
on my favorite TV show.

437
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,840
Just like you were probably
the cool girl in high school

438
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,120
and now you're famous

439
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,960
and everyone's shipping you
and the hottest guy in Gotham.

440
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,120
We have nothing in common.

441
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,880
In fact, you pretending
to feel bad for me

442
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,480
is kinda making it worse,

443
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,440
so, could you just leave me alone

444
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:49,080
before I find more reasons
to wish I were dead?

445
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,680
Moore to base,
just showed up to Gotham U.

446
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,120
She saw her gone to room 119.

447
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,280
You're that psycho.

448
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,480
Charmed, I'm sure.

449
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,720
And I understand you're the terrier.

450
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,320
Run, Parker.

451
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,320
Don't worry about the bat,
she'll come play later.

452
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,880
For now, believe it or not,
I actually need you.

453
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,200
I love living in the world

454
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,680
where we trust teenagers
with these things.

455
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,720
Why are you doing this?

456
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,120
Because my inner mean girl

457
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,880
never got to live out
her high school experience.

458
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,080
I'm looking for Batwoman,

459
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,200
and you moronic classmates
tagged her in a photo here.

460
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,360
Knock it off.

461
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,400
Good. The hall monitor's back.

462
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,800
Let the girl go.

463
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,080
I will.

464
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,120
But first, I need you to figure out

465
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,480
that you are not a hero.

466
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,960
What does she have to do with this?

467
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:00,640
She's a very important tool
in my very important plan.

468
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,040
Which I'll tell you.

469
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,840
After you drop
the whole hero complex.

470
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,360
Take off the mask, Batwoman.

471
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,120
What's going on? Where is everyone?

472
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,160
What's the point of running a clinic

473
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,280
when you can't even save
your own mom.

474
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,040
I'm not a doctor.

475
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,600
If you're here, I'm hoping that
means that Alice is at Arkham.

476
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,520
She wasn't at Gotham University.

477
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,120
What are you talking about?
I saw her run into that building.

478
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,120
We searched every dorm room, Mary.

479
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,800
She wasn't there.

480
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,360
Maybe Dr. Campbell was right.

481
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,920
You should go somewhere.

482
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,800
Relax, grieve your mom.

483
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,800
You think I'm seeing things too.

484
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,920
I think your world just fell apart...

485
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,760
And you're looking for something

486
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,800
to distract you
from how painful it is.

487
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
Look...

488
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,880
No judgment.

489
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,640
My marriage just blew up...

490
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,000
And I nearly took the wrong guy's
head off earlier.

491
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,760
We're human.

492
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,160
We'd rather be doing anything...

493
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,960
Other than feeling our feelings.

494
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,320
I'm not crazy.

495
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,440
I swear I'm not imagining things,
Sophie.

496
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,040
Finding Alice isn't going
to bring your mom back.

497
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,920
What's wrong, Batwoman?

498
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,200
Shy?

499
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,080
Come on, show us
your pretty little face.

500
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,320
Why are you doing this?

501
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,600
Because you're obsessed
with saving people

502
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
who don't want to be saved.

503
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,880
Give it up, give up, give up!

504
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,200
I know what you're doing.

505
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,120
I put away the bat,

506
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
so I can join you
in some twisted fairytale.

507
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,160
Take off the mask, Batty!

508
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,480
You're sick, Alice.

509
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,120
Alice, stop.

510
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Stop it!

511
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Do it!

512
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,320
Fine!

513
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,200
Holy crap.

514
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,360
You're Kate Kane.

515
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,880
That would be me.

516
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,920
I, like, drive by
your real estate firm every day.

517
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,120
- Hi.
- Hi.

518
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,760
I just read the <i>Advocate.</i>
Lesbian CEOs under 30.

519
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,360
Oh, my god. I was such a bitch
to you earlier.

520
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,720
Why didn't you say
you were super gay?

521
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,960
Kind of still figuring out
how much to tell people.

522
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
Okay, hello. Boring!

523
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,320
- Can we move this along, please?
- Happily, just...

524
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,480
Let her go.

525
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:56,880
No. I meant, to the next
phase of my plan.

526
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,800
You see, I've been following you
and now I need cyber sunshine

527
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,400
to do that thing that she did

528
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,120
where she accessed
everyone's phones

529
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,480
on Gotham's cellular network.

530
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,480
And then I need her to out my sister

531
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,760
as Gotham's red-headed knight.

532
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,120
Don't do this, Alice.

533
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,160
No hero, no bat,

534
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,960
no one trying to change who I am.

535
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,880
Everyone lives happily ever after.

536
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,680
And if I don't?

537
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,360
What are you going to do? Kill me?

538
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,200
You need me, if you kill me,
you lose.

539
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
As do you.

540
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,800
Because you're dead.

541
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,360
I'm sorry, did they not
teach math in school?

542
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,480
Alice!

543
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,080
It's fine!

544
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,400
I'm obviously not going to kill her.

545
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,120
I will kill everyone else
in this school, though.

546
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,480
I didn't know who to bring
to the dance,

547
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,720
so I brought C-4.

548
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,640
They do still teach science
in this school, right?

549
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,000
- You're lying.
- No, she's not.

550
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,800
I'm not outing Batwoman.

551
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,680
Send the message or
she will kill everyone in here.

552
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,200
If I out you,

553
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,840
everyone you care about
will be in danger.

554
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,280
You'll probably will be arrested.
You won't be Batwoman anymore.

555
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,600
- I can take care of myself.
- But Gotham can't.

556
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
We need you.

557
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,400
If Batwoman goes away,
the city's hope goes with it.

558
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,000
I think I just puked in my mouth.

559
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,080
I'll do it.

560
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,960
Tell everyone.

561
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Fine.

562
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,520
Well, I guess we figured out
why they call you generation Z.

563
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,920
Because...

564
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,440
You try hacking ten cellular networks

565
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
with one hand.

566
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,800
It's done. I did it.

567
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,160
All of Gotham now knows
Kate's secret.

568
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,400
Is everyone seeing this?

569
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,760
Alpha team, run the move
to Gotham Prep, let's go.

570
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,720
- Go.
- Maybe I don't want to.

571
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,560
Maybe I don't care, go!

572
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,480
Now, where were we?

573
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,040
- Hey!
- Right about there.

574
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,720
How do I disarm this bomb?

575
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,560
Enough with the games.
You're not a hero!

576
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:05,120
It doesn't take a hero to know
what pure evil looks like.

577
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,760
You ruined my life.

578
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,160
I fixed your life, Kate.

579
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,840
Our father didn't believe us.

580
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,360
Now he's being punished.

581
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,080
Catherine tried to keep us apart
for 15 years,

582
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
and now she's dead.

583
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,680
What more do I have to do
to prove my loyalty to you?

584
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,880
You can tell me that you didn't
put a bomb in a gym full of kids.

585
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,640
Here we go again.

586
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,200
- Judgy, judge, judge.
- If everything you have done

587
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,720
has been some kind of gift to me,
then take it all back.

588
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,200
Why can't you accept me
for who I am?

589
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,880
We're sisters, Kate.

590
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,440
Be my sister!

591
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,240
We were sisters.

592
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,400
And then Beth died.

593
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,800
And the world would be
a whole lot better

594
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,800
if she had stayed dead.

595
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,760
I don't believe you.

596
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,640
What did she do?

597
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,160
What did she do?

598
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,320
She saved their lives.

599
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,800
We establish the perimeter,
then make contact.

600
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,160
I'll lead a team to the west,

601
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,760
there's a faculty entrance
on the South side.

602
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,960
Let's get there, now!

603
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,400
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

604
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,720
Get off the driveway.

605
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,360
There's a bomb in the high school.

606
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,920
Get back, take cover.

607
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,920
Come on! Let's go!
Come on! Everyone out!

608
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,800
Go! Let's go, now! Move!

609
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,080
Well, she saved most of their lives.

610
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,920
What are you talking about?

611
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,600
No one said that...
that was the detonator.

612
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Where is it?

613
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,400
Go! Let's go, let's go!

614
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Oh, my god!

615
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,920
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

616
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,840
Not happening!

617
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,360
Why not?

618
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,280
It's an office.

619
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,360
What were you expecting?

620
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,280
Like, I don't know,
a bunker or something?

621
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,240
Where's your bat bike?

622
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,760
What bat bike?

623
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,960
What bat bike.

624
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,160
Ow, child, remember?

625
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,400
Community service.

626
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,880
For that stun that you pulled
on the subway

627
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,680
and then doxing the mayor.

628
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,360
A 150 hours scrubbing gravity?

629
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,320
Yeah, and if I found out
you're still hacking,

630
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,480
you'll be scrubbing toilets
at Gotham Juvie.

631
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,360
Oh, and you're going to pay back
every single person

632
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,800
who send you blackmail money.

633
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,680
Fine.

634
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,240
Alice could've killed you.

635
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,600
I was outed before I wanted
my parents to know.

636
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,960
I wasn't about to do
the same thing to you.

637
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,160
And if you're wondering

638
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,760
if I'm going to tell anyone
about you, I...

639
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,840
I'm not.

640
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,480
Dismissed.

641
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,920
Okay, then.

642
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
See you around.

643
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,360
Parker...

644
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,040
You're right.

645
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,120
Sometimes it feels like
it's not going to get better.

646
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,320
You will.

647
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,760
If you stop hating yourself.

648
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,520
If you ever want to talk
about your parents, or

649
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,040
Kayla Mason, anyone.

650
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:57,680
I'm here.

651
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,280
Thanks.

652
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,520
You know...

653
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,640
When you took off your mask...

654
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,920
I never in a million years
expected it to be you.

655
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,200
Someone like me.

656
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,840
I'm glad it was.

657
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,960
No one offered you anything to drink?

658
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
Good.

659
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,600
Careful, Sophie.

660
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,680
We know how this job
worked out for your old boss.

661
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,280
The Mayor was more than willing
to hand you over to me.

662
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,160
So you're going
to sit here indefinitely

663
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,480
until you tell me
where to find Mouse.

664
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,760
Well, look who reached
cover girl status.

665
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,560
Look, I... I know what are you
going to say,

666
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,400
it was reckless,
it links me to Batwoman,

667
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,760
it puts our operation in jeopardy.

668
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,800
I was going to say that
whole lot of people

669
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,720
are about to feel a lot less alone,

670
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,440
and if this fallout,
we'll figure it out.

671
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,960
Happy birthday!

672
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,960
Baked it myself by the way.

673
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,320
Turns out when
I'm not on the comms,

674
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,000
I have way too much free time
on my hands.

675
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,480
Yeah, can you not leave me
alone like that again?

676
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,440
It's weird, kind of sounds
like you missed me.

677
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,280
- I managed.
- So that's a yes.

678
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,480
Hope it comes true.

679
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,600
<i>Okay, people, time to recalibrate
our gaydar.</i>

680
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,440
<i>Batwoman is a lesbian,</i>

681
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,960
<i>not that there's anything
wrong with that.</i>

682
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
<i>But talk to me, Gotham,</i>

683
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,560
<i>whatever happened to politics
staying out of our superheroes?</i>

684
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,760
<i>We all wear a mask of some kind</i>

685
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,160
<i>a cowl, a husband,
wife, denial, anger.</i>

686
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,840
<i>We all need our shield
to protect us from the world.</i>

687
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,120
<i>But for people like us,</i>

688
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,600
<i>it's not always about stopping
a runaway train</i>

689
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,040
<i>or disarming a bomb.</i>

690
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,680
Okay, as a doctor, you should
really remove the word crazy

691
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,360
from you every day vernacular.

692
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,320
Yes.

693
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,040
Thanks, have fun
on the wrong side of history.

694
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,160
Bye.

695
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
Hi.

696
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,840
<i>Sometimes the best way
to save someone,</i>

697
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,720
<i>is to be yourself.</i>

698
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,880
You were right.
Mary just needed a hug.

699
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,800
I'm sure she wasn't the only one.

700
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,000
You two are gonna need each other
now more than ever.

701
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,400
You're on my phone, puppy dog.

702
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,280
We're going to get you
out of there, dad.

703
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,080
I wish I could be with you today.

704
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:22,160
Happy birthday, kiddo.

705
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,400
Happy birthday!

706
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,360
How did you get in here?

707
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,840
Easy.

708
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,720
Hey, did you guys fire
that hot front desk guy?

709
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,640
Because he's the best part
of this place.

710
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,720
Hi.

711
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,240
I'm back.

712
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,880
Happy birthday!

713
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,360
- Did Sophie let you go?
- Who?

714
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,640
Kate, I'm finally come home
after a semester abroad

715
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,480
and this is how you react?

716
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,400
It was bad enough that they
converted my apartment

717
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,840
into a boy's dorm room

718
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,880
and no one chose to tell me...
Kate!

719
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,400
Who are you?

720
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,200
What's wrong with you?

721
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,360
- Who are you?
- It's me, it's Beth!

722
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
Beth?

723
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,560
Who the hell else would I be?
