1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
<i>Previously on</i> Batwoman...

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,640
Kate, it's Mary. Sophie's missing.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,240
- Kate.
- Hey, Dad.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,280
- We're gonna find her.
- Then let me help.

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,240
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Alice.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,960
<i>Bruce never stopped looking
for your sister's body.</i>

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,280
Guy had the best tech on the planet.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,480
Why didn't he find her?

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,080
Pick one, Commander.
Sophie or Gotham.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,440
Why are you doing this?

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,520
- I am not used to being found.
- Clever girl.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,880
Let's take a picture, Beth.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,320
Make sure our necklaces are in it.

14
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,680
Beth.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,240
Mom! Mom, wake up!

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,680
<i>- Tell me something, Bruce.</i>
- Mom!

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,960
<i>- What's the difference between...</i>
- Beth, please! Grab my hand!

18
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,600
<i>- being hopeful and being crazy?</i>
- Kate!

19
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,880
<i>Because whatever it is
got me through that day</i>

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,120
<i>and the years that followed.</i>

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,680
Mom! Beth!

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,080
{\an5}<i>Beth wasn't found in the car
with my mom,</i>

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,440
{\an5}<i>and as long as there wasn't a body,</i>

24
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,880
<i>there was hope.</i>

25
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,720
<i>The entire city went out
looking that first night.</i>

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,920
<i>But days went by, and then
weeks, and then months,</i>

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,280
<i>and eventually,
it was just my dad and me.</i>

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,960
- Beth!
- Beth!

29
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,320
<i>A decade and a half later</i>

30
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,800
<i>and my dad and I are still looking,</i>

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,720
<i>but while I'm looking for my sister,</i>

32
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,400
<i>my dad is looking
for someone else entirely.</i>

33
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,160
{\an5}Alice is a lunatic,
Dodgson a traitor.

34
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,280
Former Crow turned Wonderland Gang

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,560
second in command.

36
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,240
Together, they want to terrorize
the citizens of Gotham

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,200
by undermining the people
actually protecting them, us.

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,000
I want them stopped, dead or alive.

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,320
Wait.

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
- Let's go.
- Yeah, let's bounce.

41
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,640
Cool.

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,440
Where's Alice?

43
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,280
What the hell is that?

44
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,680
<i>My dad would never believe
my theory that Alice was Beth,</i>

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,000
<i>but I didn't have a choice.
I had to make him understand</i>

46
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,280
<i>before the Crows killed her first.</i>

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,360
{\an5}Three hours later?
Where the hell were you?

48
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,560
Around.

49
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,760
Did anyone see you?

50
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,160
Bystanders, police,
cameras, cell phones?

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,640
Seriously, Kate,

52
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,880
you can't be going out
in Gotham every night

53
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
pretending to be Batman.

54
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,360
I need to find her.

55
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,760
{\an5}If Alice is my sister,
I need to know.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,360
{\an5}<i>Good morning, Gotham.</i>

57
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,080
<i>Your bestie, Vesper Fairchild, here.</i>

58
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,800
<i>On a normal Tuesday,
I'd want to know who wore who</i>

59
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,360
<i>to last night's Gotham Gala,</i>

60
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,680
<i>who got drunk, who got clawed,</i>

61
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,240
<i>but Batman fever is upon us, people.</i>

62
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,840
<i>It has been four days</i>

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,400
<i>since we saw him
soaring through the sky.</i>

64
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,320
<i>And it's still all anyone
can tweet about.</i>

65
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,680
<i>Is Batman finally back
after a three-year hiatus?</i>

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,960
<i>- Talk to me, Gotham.
- I think it's him.</i>

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,920
<i>If you look at that picture
they have in the paper,</i>

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,080
<i>it's his cape. It's iconic.</i>

69
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,320
<i>Heard Alice's gang firebombed
a Crows truck last night.</i>

70
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,560
<i>Batman picked a good time
to come home.</i>

71
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,920
<i>In my search for Alice,
something else happened.</i>

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,840
<i>A city divided by walls,
money, and bad luck</i>

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,800
<i>rallied around a single hope,
Bruce, you.</i>

74
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,600
{\an5}<i>Except I was too busy to notice.</i>

75
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,040
{\an5}I don't like their market
response to the AR.

76
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,040
Let's pull out and see if we can
spark interest in Dubai.

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,520
{\an5}Do you see this baby turtle
eating this strawberry?

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,920
It's so cute, I want one.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,440
- Morning, everyone.
- Morning.

80
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,760
{\an5}Herd the Crows killed a lead
on Alice last night.

81
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,720
{\an5}Maybe if you reconsidered
my offer to join my team,

82
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,080
{\an5}you could help us with that.

83
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
{\an5}The Crows aren't really
a good fit for me right now.

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,800
- Because of Sophie?
- Oh, my gosh.

85
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
{\an5}Can we talk about the fact
that she's married to a man?

86
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,480
Let's not.

87
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
{\an5}I'm not trying to label her
or anything,

88
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,360
{\an5}but what's her deal exactly?

89
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
{\an5}- She's married, honey. Drop it.
- Yeah.

90
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,000
I get that, but she could
still be bi, bi-curious,

91
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,120
- pan, poly, omni...
- I think Alice is Beth.

92
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,120
Well...

93
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,960
{\an5}Kate, what are you talking about?
That's ridiculous.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,520
{\an5}I thought they found her body.

95
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,080
They found bone fragments.

96
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,000
Skull fragments matching Beth's DNA.

97
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,360
I was able to get one
of Alice's knives.

98
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,000
It has a garnet stone,
our birth stone.

99
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,920
If we can test the knife
for DNA...

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,040
{\an5}Kate, listen to yourself.

101
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
She has a vendetta against you.

102
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,800
Why?

103
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,000
Why not kill me
when she had the chance,

104
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,280
and why does she seem to know
everything about me?

105
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,360
I know that you want to believe
that Beth is alive.

106
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,960
I do too, but facts are facts.

107
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,760
Beth's dead.

108
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,960
Katie, Alice kidnapped Sophie.

109
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,600
She drove a bomb
into a park full of families.

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,920
{\an5}She killed two police officers
in cold blood.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,680
How on earth could she be Beth?

112
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,880
{\an5}Alice is Beth,
and I'll prove it to you.

113
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,960
Such a lovely home.
So nice of you to let us stay.

114
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,520
{\an5}Is the pleasure
of making a daisy chain

115
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,200
{\an5}worth the trouble of getting up
and picking the daisies?

116
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,440
{\an5}We're all thinking it.
You should give up, Alice.

117
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,400
{\an5}Simon's dead, Gus is in the wind,

118
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,680
and we're all scampering
about from hole to hole,

119
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,920
trying to avoid getting
snatched up by our tails.

120
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,120
{\an5}But we're still poor, are we not?

121
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,320
{\an5}We're still vulnerable, are we not?

122
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,880
And they are still rich and powerful

123
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,880
and protected by the Crows.

124
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,160
Bullies paid for by richer bullies

125
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,000
{\an5}all with the goal of sweeping us
into the shadows to be forgotten.

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,920
{\an5}Jacob Kane is not man enough
to protect this city

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,520
because he's a quitter,

128
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
and when things get difficult,
he gives up.

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,480
I think it's time for Gotham to watch
Commander Crow squirm.

130
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,760
Yeah!

131
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,760
Tell me you found my favorite knife.

132
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,200
- No luck.
- What the hell did I do with it?

133
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,080
It is so much more fun
unveiling my evil plan

134
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,760
when I can flip it about for cadence.

135
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,320
And how does Kate Kane
fit into that evil plan?

136
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,840
Now, you are so cute
when you're jealous.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,680
I want to make sure we stay on point.

138
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,360
Uproot the city's confidence
in the Crows,

139
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,920
let chaos reign.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,400
It's so boring when he says it.

141
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,040
You're making this personal, Alice.

142
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,160
It is personal.

143
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,280
My father gave up on me,

144
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,560
and I want to make him suffer
the way that I did

145
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,840
by stripping away everything
that he cares about

146
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,000
until he's all alone.

147
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,800
Where is my damn knife?

148
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,760
<i>Mom! Beth!</i>

149
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,920
Beth!

150
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,680
Hey, kiddo, you're okay.

151
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,360
I'm right here.

152
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,120
Same one?

153
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,680
You...

154
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,520
You know, you have a bed.

155
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I need to stay out here
in case she calls.

156
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,480
Dad?

157
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,080
Do you promise
we'll never stop looking for her?

158
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,440
I promise.

159
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,840
Got your text.

160
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,520
Yes, technically,
Wayne is in possession

161
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,480
of a thermal cycler and PCR mixers.

162
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,640
- PCR?
- Polymerase chain reaction.

163
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,880
It's used to separate
and amplify DNA,

164
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,120
which then needs to be analyzed

165
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,640
against another sample for a match.

166
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,040
So, if I could provide you
with another sample...

167
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,320
Sorry, I just keep the doors
locked and the lights on.

168
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,000
For Bruce Wayne, who isn't here.

169
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,320
Currently, but not ultimately,

170
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,600
which is why we need to talk
about his suit.

171
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,240
Are you watching the news?

172
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,040
The city is clamoring
for a hero that isn't here,

173
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,040
and I know you don't want
to be the city's next great hope,

174
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,480
but it's too late
because they think you're him.

175
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,720
I need that suit to stop Alice.

176
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,680
My cousin figured it out years ago.

177
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,720
Be more terrifying than your enemy.

178
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,360
Do you know what this is?

179
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
A Bat-weapon.

180
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,520
Laser saw.

181
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,480
This thing will cut through anything.

182
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,280
Cool.

183
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,160
- What about this?
- Gas mask?

184
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,440
Rebreather.

185
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,160
To breathe underwater without a tank.

186
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,040
See, these aren't toys.

187
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,080
These are one-of-a-kind
dangerous tools

188
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,200
which even I don't know how to use.

189
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,920
I don't how to use half
the stuff in here

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,400
because it's not meant for me.

191
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,320
It's meant for Batman.

192
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
You know who you sound like?

193
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,720
- I'm sure you'll tell me.
- Lucius Fox.

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,040
Trust me, I am a far cry
from my father.

195
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,360
Oh, I know.

196
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,840
He was actually useful.

197
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,200
That's funny.

198
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,560
"Define the goal,
define the objective,

199
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
define the terms of victory."

200
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,880
Your dad made those
for the office.

201
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,920
Now, imagine him teaching you
how to play T-ball.

202
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,600
Is this you?

203
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,720
What? This? This dude in the picture?

204
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,920
The person in this picture
dressed as Batman

205
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,320
who saved my life the other night.

206
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,080
- Was that you?
- Anyone who knows me

207
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,200
knows I hate Batman.

208
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,560
So does your dad,

209
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,800
which would make putting on this suit

210
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,160
an incredibly reckless move.

211
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,840
Wasn't me.

212
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,520
Besides, if I were gonna save you
in a dramatic fashion,

213
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,720
I would totally dress
as Wonder Woman.

214
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,560
Can we go somewhere private?

215
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,880
I need you to run that for DNA.

216
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,120
Alice tried to kill me.

217
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
She put me on a plank
20 stories in the air

218
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,160
and watched it drop.

219
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,480
She's sick.

220
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,520
She's a monster, Kate.

221
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,240
She's not your twin.

222
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,120
If I can get her DNA off the knife,

223
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,640
I can compare it with my own.

224
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,320
Look.

225
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,560
I know why you want Beth to be alive,

226
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,720
but aren't you getting
your hopes up over nothing?

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,040
Maybe.

228
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,040
But you know me and hope.

229
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,800
Your dad would kill me.

230
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,520
I can't.

231
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:06,960
You know, if...

232
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,640
If I'd known
you were getting married,

233
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,120
I would have come back sooner.

234
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,040
I didn't think
weddings were your thing.

235
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,880
Not to go. To stop it.

236
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,200
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

237
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,520
Got it. Got it. Go, go, go!

238
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,880
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

239
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,920
Are you though?

240
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,240
Not really.

241
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,960
This is exactly
what I was worried about.

242
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,200
You put yourself directly
in Alice's crosshairs,

243
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,920
and you brought her
right to our doorstep.

244
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,200
How the hell did she even know
I had her knife?

245
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,200
Are you hearing yourself?
Talk some sense into her, please.

246
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,200
All due respect, sir,

247
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,360
I don't see any harm

248
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,520
in running a DNA test on Alice
if we can catch her.

249
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,800
My daughter died.

250
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,520
I have the lab results that prove it.

251
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,320
Alice, that thing, is a cop killer

252
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,160
who drove enough C-4
into Robinson Park

253
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,640
to level a square block.

254
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,640
I am not saying
Alice is a good person.

255
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,440
All I'm saying is
it has been 15 years.

256
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,960
We don't know what happened to her.

257
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,680
What if somewhere deep down
inside of her

258
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,120
she is actually Beth?

259
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,560
The GCPD just gave us
the green light to put her down.

260
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,560
- I'm not wasting the shot.
- Excuse me, sir.

261
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,360
Update on the missing rabbit
from last night.

262
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,440
Traced him into Tricorner,
found a blood trail,

263
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,960
then it disappeared
somewhere around Bennett Ave.

264
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,680
What are you doing here?

265
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,280
Is there a password or something?

266
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,440
Get in.

267
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,880
It goes without saying,

268
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,200
but this clinic breaks
no less than ten laws an hour,

269
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,560
and considering that
your dad runs the Crows...

270
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,960
- Not planning to tell him.
- Good,

271
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,160
because it's hard enough
balancing this with med school,

272
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,520
and I can't exactly protest

273
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,000
Gotham's failing healthcare system

274
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,520
from the inside of a prison cell.

275
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,760
What's your stance on
doctor-patient confidentiality?

276
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,600
Came in this morning,
bleeding pretty bad.

277
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
Won't say anything, not unusual,

278
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,840
but then, look at what I pulled
out of his scapula.

279
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,000
He's a Batman victim.

280
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,160
I'm so keeping this, FYI.

281
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,640
He's one of Alice's guys.

282
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,000
- I saw it on the news.
- Good to know.

283
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,280
Actually, I'm really glad
that you're here.

284
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,040
I was thinking that we haven't
really had any sister time

285
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,360
since you've been back,

286
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
and I was just reading about

287
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,440
this brand-new plant-based cafe
that is so organic,

288
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,960
your fork literally dissolves
in your hand

289
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,320
if you don't eat fast enough.

290
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,480
- Sounds good.
- Oh, cool. Okay.

291
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,160
So, see you back here at seven?

292
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,640
Not sure that's a good idea

293
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,080
considering
he's a domestic terrorist.

294
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,080
I need you to send a message
to Alice from Kate Kane.

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,400
Waffles. Now, get out of here.

296
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,160
Waffles?

297
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,200
If Alice is Beth,
she'll know what it means.

298
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,720
What does it mean?

299
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,200
It's better if you don't know.

300
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,360
See you at 7.00.

301
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,880
Surveillance narrows them
to the Kubert District.

302
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,040
Caught Dodgson in alley
about three hours ago.

303
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,600
The rabbit we shot last night
was seen at a C Store earlier

304
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,120
just a few blocks away.

305
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,680
Must be hovering around there.

306
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,760
In a suburban, white
picket-fence neighborhood?

307
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,440
Not really the MO of a gang
who hides in the shadows.

308
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,600
I know where they are.

309
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:27,000
Get every available man
to 1472 Norman Drive, now.

310
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,320
- Yes, sir.
- Sir?

311
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,360
We're wasting time.

312
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,280
- Hey, I can't really talk.
- Then just say yes.

313
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,240
I need you to buy me some time
while I find Alice.

314
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,680
<i>Kate, it's too late.</i>

315
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,440
I just need you to stall
the Crows for a couple of hours.

316
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,720
Kate, I'm not helping you
if I don't know what you did.

317
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,000
I got her a message.

318
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,760
I asked her to meet
at our favorite place,

319
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,560
and if she's really Beth,
she'll know what it means.

320
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,680
The waffle stand.

321
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,480
- You remembered.
<i>- You know how dangerous she is.</i>

322
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,320
Don't do this.

323
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,840
My dad is going to kill
my sister, Sophie.

324
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,480
Please just...

325
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,280
Buy me some time
so I can prove him wrong.

326
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,600
Oh, come on. Hey, hey.
Why are you doing that?

327
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,440
What are you doing, Luke?
It's not a toy.

328
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,880
Stop.

329
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,920
Please just...

330
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,440
I did not mean to...

331
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,440
Okay.

332
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,640
What, you don't like chocolate
all of a sudden?

333
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm not hungry.

334
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,280
Come on.

335
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,960
You're the world record holder
for fastest waffle consumption.

336
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,960
Title's in jeopardy.

337
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,280
We shouldn't be eating.
We should be looking for Beth.

338
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,120
Been looking for months.

339
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,800
We deserve a sugar break.

340
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,000
It was my fault.

341
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,280
Hey.

342
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,080
Hey, why would you say that?

343
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,560
You weren't there, Dad.

344
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,880
After we crashed,

345
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,080
Beth went to check on Mom
in the front seat.

346
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,480
Instead of helping, I climbed out.

347
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,280
I left her.

348
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,440
You were being safe.

349
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,920
But I could have grabbed her,

350
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,080
but I was too scared
if my feet left the ground,

351
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,480
I'd go over, too.

352
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,400
I should have just climbed
on the car and grabbed her.

353
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,360
She was my sister.
Why didn't I try a little harder?

354
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,720
Come here. Come here.
You're okay.

355
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,440
Go, go, go!

356
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,800
Oh, my God!

357
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,880
They're gone, sir.

358
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,600
TV dinner's still in the microwave.

359
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,760
Damn it.

360
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,040
How did you know she was here?

361
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,680
Beth grew up here.

362
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,640
This was our old house.

363
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,040
- Sir, you don't think...
- Of course not.

364
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,800
She's trying to get in my head.
It's not gonna work.

365
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,120
Well, look who finally
figured it out.

366
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Are you my sister?

367
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,480
Who in the world am I?

368
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Now, that is the great puzzle,
isn't it?

369
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,440
Did you know I was gonna have
your knife tested for DNA?

370
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,760
You had my knife?

371
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,080
And here I've been going around
using this charmless contraption.

372
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,880
You didn't have your guys jump me.

373
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,560
Jump you?

374
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,880
Kate, we're sisters.

375
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,000
Prove it.

376
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,040
Let me test your DNA
before the Crows kill you.

377
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,360
I already proved it.

378
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,360
I'm here.

379
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,600
I knew the password.

380
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,520
"Waffles."

381
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,440
Our favorite spot.

382
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,120
We used to come here
after school on Fridays

383
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,400
and gorge our faces
in chocolate-covered garbage.

384
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,400
How else would I know that?

385
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,040
Unless...

386
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,200
Oh, dear.

387
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,120
Did the press mention that
you and Beth used to come here

388
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,120
as part of your
silly little tradition,

389
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,520
and did I read
an old article online?

390
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,640
- Sir.
- We're going to Tricorner.

391
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,600
They just left can't be too far.

392
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,960
Sir, she's not in Tricorner.

393
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,640
I want checkpoints
on all the bridges.

394
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Sir?

395
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,400
I know where she is.

396
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,720
They found skull fragments.
They declared you dead.

397
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,200
Then why are you still here?

398
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,400
If I were really your twin,
wouldn't you feel something?

399
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,320
How did you survive the crash?

400
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,520
Crash. The crash.

401
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,280
Oh, yes, the crash.

402
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,640
Let's see. We hit the water
with a dramatic splash.

403
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,960
When I opened my eyes,

404
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,360
my mother's head was on
the other side of the windshield.

405
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,640
A surreal sight, a motherless head.

406
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,680
Poor Gabi, or was it Abby?

407
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,800
Nevertheless, it was cold.

408
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,320
Have you ever had a tea party
on the inside of a block of ice?

409
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,800
It's much akin to that.

410
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,760
Water rushed through
every seam of the car

411
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,320
up to my knees
and then to my neck.

412
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,520
I didn't know whether to hold
my breath or to scream,

413
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,920
but as I tilted my head
like a little mouse,

414
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,320
sucking in the increasingly
shrinking bubble of air,

415
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,800
one thought kept me calm.

416
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,440
"Surely, someone will come
and save me."

417
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,840
Feel free to get that.

418
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,920
What's wrong?

419
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,400
No interest in painting your nails,

420
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,040
gossiping about boys?

421
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,440
We have a lot to catch up on.

422
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,800
I'd rather not.

423
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,280
I came here tonight
to ask you one simple question.

424
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,280
After I disappeared,

425
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,200
when did you sleep through the night

426
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,760
for the very first time?

427
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
I haven't yet.

428
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,600
Sure you have.

429
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,760
I never moved on.

430
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,920
Why is that?

431
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,600
Because I never gave up hope
that I would find you.

432
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,800
And why is that?

433
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,840
Because I should have been with you.

434
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,920
Here's my DNA, dear.
Go prove it to Daddy.

435
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,520
Target green. I have a clear shot.

436
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,680
- Tattletale.
- Wait...

437
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,080
Get out of the way, Kate.

438
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,920
Tell your men to stand down.

439
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,440
Kate, she's in your head.

440
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,800
Then arrest her and get her help.

441
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,840
She's got a knife.

442
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,720
Drop it, or they will shoot you
and call it self-defense.

443
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,960
- Not if you stay put.
- Get out of the way.

444
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,200
Get out of the way.

445
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,640
She's your daughter,

446
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,680
and if you kill her,

447
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,760
you won't just lose Beth,
you'll lose me, too.

448
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,360
Take her to Arkham.

449
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,280
Kate.

450
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,560
Kate, hang on.

451
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,400
And here I thought
you could keep a secret.

452
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,240
I didn't tell them you'd be here.

453
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,280
"Tell us a story,"
said the march hare.

454
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,280
"Yes, please do," pled Alice,

455
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,280
and so the dormouse began,

456
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,000
"Once upon a time,
there were three little sisters."

457
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,000
What did you do?

458
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,000
You don't remember why we'd
each have to get our own waffle

459
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,560
when we came here?

460
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,680
- Because you don't like to share.
- Exactly.

461
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,160
And you are my sister, Kate.

462
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,280
No.

463
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,800
Hey, so not to rush you,
but I made 7.00pm rezzies,

464
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,440
and it's 7.45pm,

465
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,000
and I had to call in
a favor for these.

466
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,760
So, yeah, okay.

467
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,680
Call me...bye.

468
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,920
Wonderful.

469
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,840
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

470
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,480
Alice doesn't like competition.

471
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,560
Psycho!

472
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,880
All right.

473
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,840
I got you.

474
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,960
<i>Will impact his future.</i>

475
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,120
<i>We have an update on the ongoing
Wonderland Gang story.</i>

476
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,560
<i>Let's go to our eye-in-the-sky
reporter for more.</i>

477
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,720
<i>This is News Eight Gotham
in the sky with breaking news.</i>

478
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,320
<i>Is the city's nightmare finally over?</i>

479
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,320
<i>Alice, the leader
of the Wonderland Gang,</i>

480
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,720
<i>has been captured.</i>

481
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,720
<i>The Crows apprehended
the notorious killer</i>

482
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,520
<i>minutes ago in Burnside Park.</i>

483
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,240
<i>Now, as you can see, we're live.</i>

484
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,560
<i>We're following
the prison transport to Arkham,</i>

485
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,520
<i>where... Wait...wait. What was that?</i>

486
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,440
<i>What just happened?
The van has exploded...</i>

487
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,680
<i>Kate, can you hear me?</i>

488
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,960
Batcave to Kate.
You're still five minutes out.

489
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,160
I can make it.

490
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
<i>Tell me you realize
that place is crawling with cops.</i>

491
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,280
- Go, go, go!
- If you see her, shoot!

492
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,880
<i>Maybe it was fate,</i>

493
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,400
<i>watching her drown in a river</i>

494
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,400
<i>the way everyone assumed
she had years ago.</i>

495
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,560
<i>And maybe I was meant to stand by</i>

496
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,480
<i>and watch it all happen
all over again.</i>

497
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,640
<i>After all, my dad was right.</i>

498
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,840
<i>Alice was a monster.</i>

499
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:03,760
<i>She was a liar, a manipulator,
a killer, but despite all that...</i>

500
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,960
<i>She was still my sister.</i>

501
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,320
Grab my hand! Grab my hand!

502
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,920
Hey. Batcave to Kate.

503
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,280
<i>Batcave to Kate.</i>

504
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,080
Kate, are you okay?

505
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
<i>Batcave to Kate.</i>

506
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,720
<i>Wake up, Kate.</i>

507
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,800
River's down here.

508
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,680
Hey. Batcave to Kate.

509
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,160
You got a lot of cops
coming towards you right now.

510
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,960
You need to get up now.

511
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
<i>Kate!</i>

512
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,320
I know there's a defibrillator
on the suit.

513
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,360
Nothing here, nothing.

514
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,640
<i>Okay, people. Time to get real.</i>

515
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,600
<i>Massive explosion
on the Loeb Bridge last night.</i>

516
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,400
<i>The leader
of the Alice in Wonderland Gang</i>

517
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,520
<i>is in the wind,
and Batman was not there.</i>

518
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,960
<i>Was there a cowl convention
we didn't know about?</i>

519
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,120
<i>Was it Robin's
high school graduation?</i>

520
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,160
<i>Talk to me, Gotham.
Did we put our hope in a ghost?</i>

521
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,400
I just came to apologize
for missing dinner,

522
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,600
but apparently,
I missed something else.

523
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,360
Sorry.

524
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,000
So, okay.

525
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,960
Look. I get the whole
needing to know with Alice

526
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,760
because she's your sister,
and duh, sisters.

527
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,120
But her boyfriend
tried to kill me last night

528
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,960
because apparently,
she sees me as her replacement.

529
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,040
Which, under normal circumstances,

530
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,600
could, you know,

531
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,360
maybe be borderline flattering.

532
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,600
Except here, it's just ironic,

533
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,440
considering the most sisterly thing

534
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,720
that you've ever done for me

535
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,720
is pretty much
act like I don't exist.

536
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,240
Mary, it's not like that.

537
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,560
Look, don't worry.

538
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,120
You know, he took off and got scared

539
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,760
before doing any permanent damage,

540
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,880
and, no, I didn't tell your dad.

541
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,880
The last thing I need is my own
personal security detail.

542
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,440
Mary, I am so sorry.

543
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,720
Is Alice worth it?

544
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,160
Because if she is,

545
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,080
could you just tell her
that I'm not a threat, please?

546
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:46,440
How the hell did someone
get a bomb on that bridge?

547
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,080
There is something else
going on here,

548
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,840
and between the Crows
and the GCPD,

549
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,120
it needs to start making sense.
Get out!

550
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,160
I take it I'm next.

551
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,880
That stunt you pulled,

552
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,480
it's called aiding and abetting.
You crossed the line.

553
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,240
And you're about to kill
your own daughter.

554
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,400
Now, you tell me again
how my daughter did this.

555
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,640
She went into the house
where you grew up.

556
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,560
She murdered the current owners
by slitting open their throats.

557
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,720
She's not Beth, Kate.

558
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,720
Drop it, now.
Or I'll have you arrested myself.

559
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,320
Dad?

560
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,120
Hey, kiddo.

561
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,280
Come here.

562
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,880
Catherine Hamilton's
investigators found

563
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,560
bones on Miller Farm.

564
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,320
- No.
- Skull fragments

565
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,680
of a little girl.

566
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,960
They...

567
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,160
They had them tested,
and it's her, Kate.

568
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,440
It's Beth.

569
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,720
No, Dad. I checked Miller Farm
a million times.

570
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,280
Kate, they found her.

571
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,000
See? There's nothing there, Dad.

572
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,680
I would have seen it. I looked!

573
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,480
It's time to say goodbye, Kate.

574
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,000
You said you'd never give up!

575
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,360
- Kate.
- You're a traitor!

576
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,000
Kate.

577
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,520
She could have killed you.

578
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,320
You totally sold me out.

579
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,800
- It's called caring about you.
- If you cared,

580
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
you wouldn't have lied to an
entire military academy about me.

581
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,960
That's not fair, Kate.

582
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,640
So, you didn't lie?

583
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,200
I would never lie to you.
I won't ever lie to you.

584
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,640
Are you happy?

585
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,680
Yes.

586
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,640
Yes or ish?

587
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,440
I'm happy, Kate, and...

588
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,280
There is no us, okay?

589
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,200
You need to move on.

590
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,080
Did you get the suit wet?

591
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,560
Okay, so I couldn't find
the auto-dry function.

592
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,280
Yeah, because that's not a thing.

593
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,920
10.8 million dollar suit.

594
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,120
Kind of feels like an oversight.
Just saying.

595
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,320
Hey.

596
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,360
Thank you for bailing me out.

597
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,320
Yeah, I mean, I found the comms,

598
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,080
and I saw you hadn't moved in
a while, and I figured maybe...

599
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,200
- Let's not get misty-eyed.
- Yep, no problem.

600
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,400
No problem.

601
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,000
Alice said her thugs didn't jump me,

602
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,080
which means there is someone else

603
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
who doesn't want me knowing the truth

604
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,400
about the DNA on the knife.

605
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,800
Yeah.

606
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,600
Well, just so you know,
while you're figuring that out,

607
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,880
you're getting a whole lot
of people excited over nothing.

608
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,360
Get rid of it.

609
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,840
It'll be melted it
into a paperweight.

610
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,640
Destroy the masks while you're at it.

611
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,760
I'll take care of whatever
surveillance was in the garage.

612
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,920
Like it never happened.

613
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,520
<i>Luke was right, Bruce.</i>

614
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,800
<i>Gotham needed
something to believe in.</i>

615
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,440
<i>They wanted hope
just as I started to lose mine.</i>

616
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,960
<i>I spent half my life
looking for my sister,</i>

617
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,200
<i>and today, I found someone else,</i>

618
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,200
<i>someone I didn't know or recognize.</i>

619
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,880
<i>For the first time in 15 years,</i>

620
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,880
<i>I felt something other than hope.</i>

621
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,360
<i>I felt doubt.</i>

622
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,320
You're gonna tell me
everything you know about Alice.

623
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,760
Thought you were Batman.

624
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,560
You wish.

625
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,480
<i>It may have taken you years,
sweet, darling Kate,</i>

626
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,400
<i>but you found me eventually...</i>

627
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,720
<i>Even if I'm not the girl
you expected me to be.</i>

628
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,960
<i>I had my secrets
just as you have yours,</i>

629
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:08,800
<i>but do be careful, my dear sister.</i>

630
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,160
<i>Putting on that suit</i>

631
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,800
<i>and all the darkness
that comes with it...</i>

632
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,520
<i>Makes you just as crazy as me.</i>
